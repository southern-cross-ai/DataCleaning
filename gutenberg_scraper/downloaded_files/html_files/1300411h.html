  <h2><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">On a May evening a woman was walking in a delicious garden
  that was formed out of the little islands on the waters of the Seine, near
  Paris.</p>

  <p>There was a number of people moving about among the lofty elms, Italian
  poplars and weeping willows that seemed as if untouched by Art, and yet which
  had been cunningly disposed by the hand of man, for the owner of this
  pleasant place was holding one of those fêtes which had become recently so
  fashionable in the capital.</p>

  <p>But this woman walked alone.</p>

  <p>She was very famous, very sought after, and generally the centre of a
  brilliant company; but to-night she had fled all her usual associates for
  that part of the island farthest from the chateau, where she might hope to be
  undisturbed. For her heart was full of sad emotions and a passionate
  melancholy pervaded her being. Solitude and the sweetness of the hour in some
  degree soothed her; she walked yet farther away from the festivities, and the
  lamps and music, and at last stood at the edge of the island and paused,
  looking across the darkening river towards the ferry house at Bezons, where
  the boats waited to take away the guests of M. Watelet. The evening was warm
  and perfumed by the first divine freshness of spring, a few stars were out in
  a sky that was fading to a translucent green hue; these sparkled in their
  crystal colours and pure brightness as if they pulsed with intense
  vitality.</p>

  <p>A low breeze ruffled the waters of the Seine and sent little waves to
  break against the flowery banks of M. Watelet's domain.</p>

  <p>All, in deference to that passion for nature which was the reaction after
  centuries of artificiality, the nostalgia of a society too highly cultured,
  over-civilised, was studiously arranged to appear a piece of untouched
  country.</p>

  <p>Wild flowers grew among the tall grasses, humble herbs mingled with costly
  shrubs, the worldling's conception of rusticity was visible in the toy
  summerhouses and wooden bridges and seats.</p>

  <p>It was all exquisite&mdash;and as false to nature as the stiff Italian
  gardens of a preceding fashion.</p>

  <p>The lonely guest standing looking wistfully out across the water, knew
  this.</p>

  <p>She could remember the country in her childhood, the gloom, the poverty,
  the cruelty, the immensity of it&mdash;so different from this pretty
  arrangement of trees and flowers, the result of a wealthy man's taste and
  intelligence, the whim of an artist jaded with city pleasures.</p>

  <p>The woman shivered, and turned away from the edges of the river to a
  weeping willow that drooped its budding foliage over a wooden bench.</p>

  <p>There she seated herself and stared through the lovely interlacing
  branches at the stars that seemed to hang so low, that she had the illusion
  that if she put out her hand she could catch hold of one entangled in the
  willow boughs.</p>

  <p>Silent she sat, fighting with her melancholy, while the pearl-pure light
  faded about the island.</p>

  <p>She was not young, but she had such a vivid air of vitality that even when
  she was quiet, as now, she gave no impression of fading, or of the placidity
  that comes from maturity, or of the sadness or bitterness common to a woman
  whose youth is past.</p>

  <p>In every way she was vital, ardent, eager, though these qualities were
  veiled by a charming feminine timidity that showed in her look and pose, and
  the warm charm of her passionate personality lay over her like a spell. In
  person she was tall and infinitely graceful, with an elegance natural and
  improved by training Every movement showed her the great lady; very slender
  and well-fashioned, her hands and feet, her throat and bust, the set of her
  head, the swing of her shoulders, were truly beautiful.</p>

  <p>Her face that had always been plain, was disfigured by the smallpox which
  had blurred the lineaments and destroyed the freshness of the traits; her
  nose was tilted, her mouth too wide, her brown eyes large, short-sighted, and
  in no way remarkable save for their passionate expressiveness.</p>

  <p>She had been called ugly, even by her admirers, yet this was not true, as
  her features were in proportion, her teeth white, her ears small, her hair
  thick, waving, a pretty light brown colour and growing in a becoming manner
  about her low brows.</p>

  <p>Her dress, which was the finest she had, was expensive and fashionable;
  the robe and petticoat of apricot silk were veiled in faint-coloured blue
  gauze, her ruffled sleeves and her chemisette were of fine blonde lace, her
  full mantle, with a hood, was of white satin lined with white fox, and on her
  knee rested a muff of grebe's feathers.</p>

  <p>A black velvet ribbon was fastened round her throat, and her hair was
  dressed simply, with a touch of powder on the crown of her small head.</p>

  <p>She wore no jewellery whatever, the buckles on her white velvet shoes were
  of ordinary paste, and the brooch that held the laces on her bosom was of
  plain silver; thus the poverty that her dress belied was revealed.</p>

  <p>Yet her breeding became her so that she had an atmosphere of extravagance
  and wealth; although she was a woman who would have worn many jewels if she
  could&mdash;she was able to do without them as gaily as she was able to do
  without beauty.</p>

  <p>She was roused from her reflections by a masculine voice.</p>

  <p>'It is Mademoiselle de Lespinasse!'</p>

  <p>A man parted the drooping willow boughs and stood before her, looking down
  at her with a little smile.</p>

  <p>Julie de Lespinasse returned his glance totally unconcerned.</p>

  <p>'How did you find me?' she asked. 'We were only presented to each other an
  hour ago, monsieur.'</p>

  <p>'And then you disappeared, mademoiselle,' said the man, looking at her
  intently. 'And I followed you.'</p>

  <p>'Why?'</p>

  <p>'Are you not used to people following you, mademoiselle?'</p>

  <p>'You are certainly not used to seeing&mdash;people&mdash;run away,' she
  replied with a quick smile. Then, with a sudden change to a perfectly natural
  manner: 'Forgive me, I am no fit company for any one to-night&mdash;least of
  all for M. de Guibert.'</p>

  <p>'Why least of all for me?' He had a changeful, beautiful voice, wholly
  attractive, that he lowered as he spoke.</p>

  <p>He was still standing, making a darkness before her, blotting out the
  stars.</p>

  <p>'Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>!' answered Julie de Lespinasse, with a certain
  impatience, 'do you come to <i>me</i> for compliments? Half the witty and
  pretty women of Paris are here to-night&mdash;all ready to praise you. Why do
  you come to me who am ugly, old, sick, and in a melancholy mood?'</p>

  <p>She looked at him with an expression of faint irony on her mobile
  features.</p>

  <p>'Are even you tired of flattery?' she added, lightly.</p>

  <p>'Ah, you think that my head has been turned by all this boudoir
  praise&mdash;that is why you avoided me.'</p>

  <p>Julie rose.</p>

  <p>'I thought nothing at all, monsieur,' she said frankly. 'I came here
  because I was full of sadness&mdash;the fête did not prove the distraction I
  thought it would. I should have stayed at home.' She was nearly as tall as he
  and stood so near to him that her looped petticoats touched the skirts of his
  coat.</p>

  <p>It was now so dark that they could hardly see each other, and the sweeping
  branches of the weeping willow enclosed them like the meshes of a cage.</p>

  <p>'You are not happy?' he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>! Happy!'</p>

  <p>'You are one of the most envied women in Paris, Mademoiselle de
  Lespinasse.'</p>

  <p>Again impatience showed in her manner.</p>

  <p>'M. de Guibert, you know on what happiness depends. If you try to
  compliment me, I shall never count you among my friends, and that I am
  disposed to do, for many dear to me love you.'</p>

  <p>He answered her earnestly.</p>

  <p>'How can you mistake my sincerity for flattery? I have been wanting to
  meet you ever since I came to Paris.'</p>

  <p>She was used to such speeches, even from men as brilliant as this one; all
  the famous people of her world loved and admired her; for years she had
  reigned over the <i>salon</i> where all the intellect of Paris met to do her
  homage, and the language of admiration and respect had become commonplace to
  her by constant repetition.</p>

  <p>'Oh, la, la!' she cried, carrying her muff to her lips and speaking over
  it. 'Here we have M. de Guibert in a serious mood! Seeks he new worlds to
  conquer?'</p>

  <p>'You mock me, mademoiselle. Perhaps I, also, am unhappy.'</p>

  <p>Julie de Lespinasse frowned.</p>

  <p>'Why&mdash;is that possible?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Can it not be as possible for me as for you?'</p>

  <p>'But you are a <i>man&mdash;young</i>!' she cried impetuously, then
  checked herself.</p>

  <p>'Come into the open,' she added. 'These boughs stifle me.'</p>

  <p>He parted the branches for her and followed her out on to the slope of
  long grass that dipped to the edge of the river.</p>

  <p>The sky was now a deep violet colour and the stars blazed.</p>

  <p>The yellow light of lanterns showed among the boats clustered by the
  landing stage of the ferry; the wind was rising and larger waves lapped at
  the flowery banks of 'Le Moulin-Joli.'</p>

  <p>Julie turned to her companion.</p>

  <p>Do you like this better than the <i>salons</i> of Paris, monsieur?'</p>

  <p>'When I am here with you, yes,' he replied gravely.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>! how commonplace you make it with such remarks,' she
  replied; she still held her grebe muff to her cheek and the long line of her
  lovely figure was visible in the starlight.</p>

  <p>She was not insensible of the fact that she was alone with the man who was
  the most admired, most wanted in Paris, famous as soldier, philosopher,
  writer, adored by the women, envied by the men, with all her brilliant world
  at his feet.</p>

  <p>The situation that she had first accepted with indifference began to
  please her; she was a very woman and the presence, the interest of the man
  whom every one gathered at 'Le Moulin Joli' would have been enchanted to
  flatter, began to please her into some passing forgetfulness of her
  sorrow.</p>

  <p>Her piquant face, so full of light and shade, of changeful expression, of
  quick emotion, was turned towards M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>As she had not tried to disguise her preoccupation, so she did not try to
  disguise her interest.</p>

  <p>'I shall read your book,' she said.</p>

  <p>He made a gesture of protest.</p>

  <p>'Do you wish me to do something more original?' she added. 'Well,
  monsieur, perhaps I shall&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'What is that, mademoiselle?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I am very difficult&mdash;terribly difficult, and perhaps when I have
  read <i>Essai sur la Tactique</i> I shall write you a criticism!'</p>

  <p>'You would?' he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>Julie laughed.</p>

  <p>'Oh, we should not talk of books on such a night as this&mdash;<i>mon
  Dieu</i>!&mdash;the stars!'</p>

  <p>Her hurrying, rather hoarse voice, had the same arresting quality as her
  person; her speech was slightly broken and slightly difficult, but her accent
  was pure, her inflexion pleasing, emphatic and fast; in her speech, as in
  everything else, she showed breed and polish, noticeable even in the great
  world in which she moved.</p>

  <p>'Leave your book, monsieur,' she said suddenly. 'My life is already too
  full&mdash;I have no room for another interest.'</p>

  <p>Her words seemed too serious for the occasion; the young man was moved by
  something vibrant, appealing in her tone.</p>

  <p>'Ah, your life is full of friends,' he replied. 'And yet you are
  unhappy.'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' she answered, in a tone of infinite melancholy. 'The dearest of all
  leaves me, and I am frightened&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He did not know of whom she spoke, and his curiosity was roused.</p>

  <p>'Frightened?' he questioned delicately.</p>

  <p>'A mortal illness and a great distance!' said Julie, in a tone of touching
  confidence.</p>

  <p>'This is one you love?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'The only one I love,' she replied, with her swift frankness, 'though I
  have many dear, dear friends.'</p>

  <p>'Even if he be doomed, he is fortunate,' said M de Guibert.</p>

  <p>'He is the noblest man in the world,' said Julie ardently.</p>

  <p>As the bank now sloped sheer into the water, they turned aside into a
  little alley of ilex and laurel; turning again in this, a sudden light
  flooded their path. It came from a lantern of pale yellow silk that had just
  been lit and hung low on the boughs of a Lombardy poplar.</p>

  <p>Julie de Lespinasse suddenly paused and looked at the man by her side.</p>

  <p>He was very charming, more so than she had thought at first, ten years
  younger than herself, and attractive in face and figure; he wore his uniform
  as a colonel of the Corsican Regiment with a certain carelessness; despite
  his reputation as the most irresistible cavalier in Paris, there was nothing
  about him that was not serious, and even stately. He did not seem in any way
  a squire of dames.</p>

  <p>Julie noticed in him that vital air of eager interest in life that she had
  herself, but he was composed while she was nervous, perfectly balanced while
  she was overstrung.</p>

  <p>She observed this quiet sanity in him and wondered if it was that which
  made him different from her brilliant friends.</p>

  <p>'For certainly,' she thought to herself, 'he is not like any other man I
  know.'</p>

  <p>Her frank scrutiny amused him.</p>

  <p>'What do you make of me?' he asked.</p>

  <p>The pale yellow light was full over his face; the short, finely-shaped
  features quivered with life and intelligence; the complexion was fresh with
  youth and an active life; the eyes, long, gray, and sparkling, were full of
  interchanging emotions, wit, humour, and tenderness; his hair was dressed
  with a certain looseness, for all the pomade and military side curls.</p>

  <p>His whole person had an air of healthy vigour hardly to be looked for in a
  philosopher, and Julie's exact perception noted something ingenuous and
  simple about the man who had the <i>salons</i> of Paris at his feet, the
  great Voltaire proclaiming him a genius, the whole Encyclopedia acclaiming
  him, all the noted women in the capital competing for his smiles.</p>

  <p>Looking at his radiant charm, and finding how he pleased her, she became
  impatient of herself.</p>

  <p>'Oh, you will be a great man,' she said in her hasty way. 'And now I hear
  music&mdash;I think they go in to supper&mdash;'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert laughed.</p>

  <p>'You do not finish with me so easily, mademoiselle.'</p>

  <p>'Eh? What do you want of me?' she challenged. She put out the hand that
  held the muff and let the soft feathers rest on his arm; her dark eyes were
  as intense as if they veiled flame. 'I tell you my soul&mdash;my
  heart&mdash;my life is full!'</p>

  <p>'I think you could be an incomparable friend,' he insisted.</p>

  <p>'And you lack&mdash;friends?' she mocked.</p>

  <p>'Friends such as you would be&mdash;yes,' he answered calmly.</p>

  <p>Julie seemed slightly to wince; she withdrew her hand; her petticoats
  shimmered, a wonderful colour under the white satin mantle gleaming in the
  lantern light; her face was in shadow, but the frail grace of her was a
  wonderful thing; she seemed as if she might float away into the fairy-like
  twilight.</p>

  <p>'Wait till you see me in the morning,' she said. 'No woman is old, or
  ugly, or sick, or sad&mdash;at "Le Moulin Joli" on a May night, with M. de
  Guibert for company&mdash;but I am all of these&mdash;and you could never
  have patience with me.'</p>

  <p>'Am I so different from those who have patience with you?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, you are different,' she replied quickly. 'I do not think I ever knew
  any one who had such an air of&mdash;success, as you.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert coloured under his powder; in swift contrition she laid her
  hand, free of the muff now, on his arm.</p>

  <p>'Do you think I meant less than a compliment? You are so <i>alive</i>. I
  meant that.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, mademoiselle, I do not mean to pass my old age regretting the things
  I did not do in my youth.'</p>

  <p>Her eyes flashed to his; this magnificent assertion of his manhood found
  an echo in her own tumultuous heart.</p>

  <p>'I like you&mdash;you please me,' she said. 'Come and see the poor
  demoiselle in her humble room, monsieur&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I shall come,' he interrupted eagerly.</p>

  <p>'&mdash;And see me by daylight.' Her laugh quivered a little. 'And now, M.
  de Condorcet is to take me to supper&mdash;and you?'</p>

  <p>'Madame de Montsauge,' he replied, quietly; they were now strolling
  towards the pavilion where supper was served; the air was heavy with the
  sound of violins; they did not look at each other. Julie knew that he spoke
  the name of the woman who held him in chains almost as difficult to break as
  those of matrimony. She at once hated Madame de Montsauge and was instantly
  horrified at herself.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert belonged to this other woman&mdash;and she belonged to
  another man.</p>

  <p>'<i>Adieu</i>,' she said suddenly, turning away. 'You have made me forget
  my melancholy for half an hour.'</p>

  <p>'I shall come to the rue Saint-Dominique,' he told her. But she was gone
  so quickly among the trees that it seemed as if she had not heard.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">M. De Guibert, the most sought after man in Paris, returned
  to his apartments after midnight. He had been to three houses since he had
  left the fête of M. Watelet, and he was tired with the sudden fatigue of a
  man who puts all his energy into everything he does.</p>

  <p>Yet the stimulus of brilliant society, delicate adulation, and the meeting
  with a new personality, lingered in his blood, and he could not sleep.</p>

  <p>Instead, he flung himself in the chair before his desk and began turning
  over some papers that lay ready to his hand.</p>

  <p>He aspired to be a Corneille as well as a Turenne, and in the snatched
  leisure of his active life was writing dramas, poems, essays and fragments
  that experimented in every form of literary art.</p>

  <p>Voltaire had praised him, and he meant to deserve that praise.</p>

  <p>To his keen, ardent intellect, the vigour of his youth, the
  self-confidence inspired by his dazzling success, everything seemed
  possible.</p>

  <p>He was in love with life, avid for experience, sensation, adventure,
  fevered with the sense of unrest, of change that was in the air, scornful of
  the old tyrannies, the old corruptions, the old conventions.</p>

  <p>Yet he was no demagogue, fanatic, or reformer, but a professional soldier
  who had seen twelve years of active service, during which he had brilliantly
  distinguished himself in the Seven Years' War, and whose magnificent
  technical abilities had enabled him to write that masterpiece which was
  <i>L'Essai sur la Tactique</i>. This work, published secretly in Holland two
  years previously and smuggled into France, where it was eagerly passed from
  hand to hand, had at once made the young author famous among the
  intellectuals of the day through the preface&mdash;which dedicated to 'My
  Country' defied the existing constitutions of King and Church with a daring
  eloquence that delighted that band of men who, since Denis Diderot brought
  out the first volume of his <i>Encyclopaedia</i> in 1750, had been spreading
  the doctrine of free-thought, free government, and scientific materialism as
  opposed to superstitious credulity. M. de Guibert eagerly responded to the
  praise and friendship of these brilliant men and women, but he was too young
  to be satisfied with even this measure of success.</p>

  <p>Animated by a sincere patriotism, he wished to serve France in some more
  definite sense. His most ardent desire was for foreign travel; particularly
  did he long to visit Prussia, whose king was so remarkable a monarch, Russia,
  whose empress had proved such a generous friend to Denis Diderot, and those
  far northern countries of which so little was known.</p>

  <p>This charming, eager, and flattered young man was not, either, altogether
  disposed to follow the precepts he so ably endorsed in his writing; of a
  noble and military family, all his instincts were for the Court, the
  <i>salon</i>, the pomp, ease and refinement of life. He might be friends with
  men such as M. Turgot and the Marquis de Condorcet; he might applaud Voltaire
  retiring from the world in his little model village of happy peasantry, and
  Rousseau withdrawn into sulky retreat at Ermonenville; he might admire the
  crude manliness of David Hume, the impress of whose personality still
  remained on Parisian society, but he was not disposed to imitate any of these
  people.</p>

  <p>He was the man of wit and fashion, gallantry and breeding, before he was a
  philosopher or a man of letters.</p>

  <p>He wished for the usual preferment in the usual way. He was eager for
  worldly honours; the praise even of mean people pleased him. He enjoyed the
  homage of women; solitude, meditation, and peace were foreign to his
  temperament. He loved movement, company, excitement, the play, the opera,
  art, gaiety, easy love, facile friendship.</p>

  <p>He was not yet sure which path he would take towards that glory that had
  beckoned him from the onset of his career, but he was convinced that he
  should gain his goal. Voltaire and Frederic of Prussia had both prophesied
  this of him. There were those who did not hesitate to say that he would be
  the liberator of his country in that crisis that every class felt
  approaching.</p>

  <p>With all this, he was but a colonel of a Corsican regiment, and fiercely
  ambitious.</p>

  <p>In his gorgeous fortunes were two vexations; his lack of money and the
  chain of an attachment which began to gall somewhat heavily on the mounting
  spirits of the man who felt capable of bringing all the world to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>He was resolved not to be bound by Madame de Montsauge. At the same time,
  he shrank from breaking a connection to which the woman dung tenaciously, and
  which was strengthened by use and custom.</p>

  <p>As he turned over the sheets of his manuscript without finding a word to
  write, his excited brain was obsessed by the images of two women.</p>

  <p>One, Madame de Montsauge, familiar, gentle, placid, with her calm belief
  in his devotion, her quiet insistence on his attention&mdash;a woman whom he
  had known too long, loved too easily, understood too thoroughly a woman who
  had been too uniformly kind, too continuously pliable, whose infatuation for
  him was too dogged, too quiet, too unchanging. He knew her expressions, her
  ways, her habits, her clothes even, by heart&mdash;she was a symbol of
  staleness, almost of boredom, in a world that was so new and splendid.</p>

  <p>The other woman was Julie Lespinasse, the acquaintance of half an hour's
  speech, elusive, strange, full of impulses and enthusiasms, vivid,
  vital&mdash;the woman who had said that her life was too full for his
  friendship.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert wondered who the man was who thus filled the heart of Julie
  de Lespinasse. She was the admired friend of every brilliant person in Paris,
  the most famous woman among the disciples of Voltaire. Her <i>salon</i> was
  the most renowned in the capital. For nearly two years she had reigned
  there&mdash;'the Muse of the Encyclopaedia,' with tact, wit, judgment, charm,
  and discretion.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert knew very little more about her than this. He was aware that
  there was a mystery over her birth, that Madame du Deffand had brought her to
  Paris from the obscurity of a convent in Lyons, that a jealous quarrel
  between the two women had turned a warm friendship into hatred, and that
  Julie de Lespinasse, in leaving her patroness had taken with her the entire
  circle of her friends, who between them had provided the small but decent
  pension on which she lived.</p>

  <p>He knew also of her extraordinary friendship for M. D'Alembert, who
  occupied a room above her apartments and shared her daily life, a friendship
  that was respected and admired as showing both the warmheartedness and
  courage of Mademoiselle de Lespinasse.</p>

  <p>Even vulgar or envious minds had found nothing evil to say of this
  affection between the great man and the charming woman, and M. de Guibert
  knew that it was not the philosopher to whom Julie had referred as the person
  who filled her soul.</p>

  <p>Whoever this person was, the young soldier rather envied him; it would be
  pleasant to his pride to be loved by a creature like Julie.</p>

  <p>She made Madame de Montsauge appear more than ever colourless.</p>

  <p>He had a very exact memory for faces, for nuances of colour and line, and
  he could recall Julie de Lespinasse so clearly that she seemed to stand
  before him in the little, quiet, candle-lit room.</p>

  <p>Her figure was so enchantingly graceful&mdash;like a fine drawing by a
  great Master&mdash;a perfect combination of Nature and Art. She carried the
  fashions of the moment as if they had been designed for her. Never, among all
  the women of his acquaintance, had he seen one who could wear clothes so
  supremely well.</p>

  <p>He could recall the long gleaming folds of her white satin mantle, the
  flounces of the apricot taffeta and blue gauze, the shining feathers of the
  grebe muff, her lovely unjewelled hands, her slender, high-arched feet that
  had not, his fastidious eye had noted, pressed the velvet shoe out of shape,
  the delicate ankle in the thin web of the silk stocking.</p>

  <p>She was plain and he admired beauty. Yet her pale, tired face which had
  neither colour nor freshness, her passionate eyes dark beneath her hood,
  haunted his memory.</p>

  <p>The glamour of the evening, the light of the yellow silk lamp had been
  kind to her, as she had so keenly known. He also knew this, but he wanted to
  see her again; he was too young himself to set much value on the graces of
  youth. Girls had never been among his conquests.</p>

  <p>Well, he would go and see her. She was absorbed and he was bound. They
  might with safety enjoy each other's company; he had the vanity to hope that
  she would make an intimate friend of him, place him beside men like M. de
  Crillon, M. de Vaines, M. Élard, M. de Condorcet, and others of her wonderful
  circle.</p>

  <p>He would be glad to go and mingle with the elect at her famous Tuesdays,
  and to be flattered by a woman whose praise was so eagerly sought for by
  others.</p>

  <p>With a half-sigh he pushed aside his papers and rose.</p>

  <p>Life was more interesting than books; he was not the type to be most
  successful with paper and ink. It was his own personality and charm that made
  him so remarkable. Little of this got into his poems and dramas, which were
  in the nature of a <i>tour de force</i>, written because his world was
  accustomed to literary expression.</p>

  <p>He went to the window, drew the short, blue damask curtain, and looked out
  onto the night.</p>

  <p>The moon was now rising above the dark housetops, the sky was gleaming
  with a silver-blue light, half the deserted street was in shadow, half
  illuminated by the moonbeams in which the raw, fluttering flames of the lamps
  looked pale.</p>

  <p>Paris, shrouded and silent, lay before M. de Guibert, and as he regarded
  the city that was the centre of the civilised world, and which he had so
  easily fascinated, which had accorded him such intoxicating adoration, such
  eager adulation, he soon forgot the face and form of Mademoiselle de
  Lespinasse.</p>

  <p>The only person who for long occupied his thought was Jacques Hippolyte
  Antoine, Comte de Guibert, Colonel in His Majesty's Army&mdash;this strong,
  unconscious egotism, that was too ingenuous to be offensive, had largely
  contributed to his unchecked success.</p>

  <p>He stepped out onto the balcony, leant against the light iron rail and
  looked with absent eyes at the sleeping city. The remembrance of his lack of
  means came to him with a certain sting. There again he was different from the
  men who had so warmly received him into their exclusive circle. He could not
  live in an attic like D'Alembert, nor in retirement like Rousseau; the main
  facts about him were his youth and his vitality, and these must be satisfied
  with things that only money could buy. To compete with the rank and wealth by
  which he was surrounded, and to which by birth and instinct he belonged, he
  needed a great deal more money than he could at present command. Nor would
  his position be greatly improved by the death of his father, who, like
  himself, a superb soldier, had no higher rank than that of major-general, and
  who had not yet secured a military appointment of any value.</p>

  <p>Even the limited elegance of these apartments was more than could really
  be afforded by this man who was the idol of Paris. His debts were enormous,
  steadily mounting, and caused him some uneasiness. There was but one
  solution&mdash;the usual, banal one&mdash;a wealthy marriage.</p>

  <p>The apostle of the freedom of Man, the champion of the new, the elevated,
  this man who would throw down the old gods and trample on the old
  conventions, was now in his secret soul contemplating the most commonplace,
  the meanest form of achieving ease and independence.</p>

  <p>His philosophy, his freedom, could suggest nothing to him but this
  time-honoured expedient&mdash;his family must find for him some young girl
  with a magnificent fortune and suitable birth. There, too, his pride was the
  ordinary pride of his class. His wife must be fresh from a convent and
  well-born. Never for a second would he have contemplated marrying a Madame de
  Montsauge&mdash;or a Julie de Lespinasse. He faced the prospect of this
  marriage with some grimness; it was a bitter drop in the sweet, heady cup
  that was being everywhere offered to his lips.</p>

  <p>He must be chained, he who loved his liberty above all things. He must be
  burdened for ever by an insipid creature&mdash;he whom the most accomplished
  women could only satisfy for a short time. He must risk putting himself in
  that ridiculous position in which he so often put other men&mdash;that of the
  ignored, slighted, and flouted husband. Yet the thing must be done, and
  done&mdash;though he shrank from facing this&mdash;immediately. He did not
  see the irony of the position whereby he, voicing so eloquently a new and
  lofty creed, was reduced by selfish wants to the necessity of a very ordinary
  expedient, but he chafed under the prospect of this forced surrender of his
  prized liberty.</p>

  <p>Well, first, at least, he would travel. He would indulge his desire to go
  to Prussia, to study German tactics and to make the acquaintance of the
  famous Frederic, who, warrior, statesman, freethinker, and man of letters,
  was greatly admired by M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>He wished also to visit the battlefields of the Seven Years' War and study
  them in the light of his later experience and knowledge. He was slightly
  tired of the praise of women, slightly jaded by easy love affairs, a little
  weary of books and bookmen.</p>

  <p>His youth and strength clamoured within him for new adventures, fresh
  activities; the real trend of his nature was towards action not thought; his
  military ambitions were now in the ascendant&mdash;Turenne, not Corneille,
  became his model as he stared down in the dark Paris street...He believed
  that he would rather have won Fontenoy than have written Zaire. After all,
  Maurice de Saxe was more his type than Jean D'Alembert.</p>

  <p>'<i>Grand Dieu</i>!' murmured the young colonel, his thoughts ending in
  speech. 'But all these men are ill&mdash;there is not one of them who could
  shoulder a musket and a pack for half an hour's march.'</p>

  <p>Then he smiled at this heresy and yawned. A little wind blew up freshly on
  his hot face. He yawned again, overcome with sudden desire for sleep. His
  healthy mind and body cried out for repose. He turned back into his room,
  where the candles were guttering to the sockets of the gleaming brass sticks,
  and without calling his valet, who had gone to bed in despair, flung off the
  heavy braided coat of his uniform, and then, still yawning, thrust all his
  papers, poems, love-letters, military documents, together in an untidy pile,
  closed the desk, oblivious of the May moon now shining into the room, the
  beauty of the spring night, even here, in the heart of the city, of all the
  friendship, coquetry and passion, honour, applause and homage, offered him in
  those letters he had just tossed together, some unopened, most unread, and
  all unanswered, forgetful of the wistful, vivid face of Mademoiselle de
  Lespinasse and the dinging sweetness of Madame de Montsauge and only desirous
  of sleep.</p>

  <p>When he had finished his hasty toilet, brushed the pomade out of his hair
  and flung himself in an abandon of fatigue on his bed, this petted hero of
  the <i>salons</i> looked an ordinary healthy and tired young man.</p>

  <p>His profound slumbers were not disturbed by any dreams either of Julie de
  Lespinasse, Jeanne de Montsauge, or of the unknown girl who must one day be
  his wife.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">Mademoiselle De Lespinasse lived in the rue Saint-
  Dominique, in a house that faced the convent of Bellechase.</p>

  <p>It was quite a modest house, the property of a master-joiner, and Julie de
  Lespinasse had rented the second and third floors since her stormy break with
  Madame du Deffand, who inhabited rooms in the Convent of Saint-Joseph, a few
  yards away.</p>

  <p>The means of this fortuneless, and, in reality, nameless woman, consisted
  of a tiny pension left her by her mother, a small yearly sum from the Court,
  obtained for her by the influence of Madame du Deffand, the Duc d'Orleans,
  and the Duc de Choiseul.</p>

  <p>This mean pittance had been augmented by the generosity of her friends.
  Madame la Maréchale de Luxembourg had given her the furniture for her few
  rooms, Madame de Chatillon, M. Turgot, M. Henault, and M. d'Ussé had
  contributed to the expenses of her installation, and Madame Geoffrin had sold
  her three most beautiful Carl Van Loos to the Empress of Russia, and with the
  sum she received had secured a life income for Mademoiselle de Lespinasse;
  this had been added to by M. de Vaines, and brought Julie's income to about
  twelve thousand livres. This sum was not sufficient, despite the modest way
  in which she lived, to relieve her of all care, for she managed her affairs
  badly, having very little interest in them, and spent extravagantly on
  clothes. Her minute establishment was that of a great lady; she kept two
  women servants, a lackey, and her tirewoman; her apartment was a nobleman's
  hotel in miniature. She was like M. de Guibert In this&mdash;that she
  followed ancient traditions while preaching new ideas.</p>

  <p>Her tastes were fine, luxurious, and exquisite. She had indulged them in
  the furniture that the generosity of Madame de Luxembourg had paid for; she
  had now lived nearly ten years in the rue Saint-Dominique, and the place
  perfectly expressed her personality, and those who obtained the envied
  privilege of the <i>entrée</i> to her <i>salon</i> found the dwelling as
  charming as the mistress. Julie loved the place; until she had owned these
  few rooms she had always had to defer to the taste of others, and she still
  felt an intense satisfaction in having, even within these limits, everything
  that entirely pleased her. She lived on the second floor, a small
  ante-chamber led into the <i>salon</i>, a fair-sized room with the windows
  looking onto the street; the walls were of pale wood with sculptured panels,
  and set with four large mirrors in gilt frames facing the windows. These were
  hung with taffeta curtains of a dull, soft shade of crimson. The floor was of
  polished wood and there were no carpets or mats; the fireplace was furnished
  with dogs and irons in polished iron, ornamented with brass. On the
  mantelpiece stood a handsome <i>pendule</i> clock by Masson and two branched
  candlesticks in ormolu. Either side of this mantelpiece stood a marble bust
  on a pedestal, one of M. D'Alembert, one of M. Voltaire, and near the windows
  was an exquisitely-executed alabaster bird, poised for flight, on a stand of
  gilt brass. Before the fire stood a face-screen of green silk, a little table
  with a green velvet cover that held a tiny box and <i>pot-pourri</i> jar of
  lacquer, a <i>bergère</i> with green damask cushions, and a large chair with
  arms covered with crimson damask. Two arm, and three single chairs, of the
  Regency period, of gilt wood with cane bottoms, an ottoman in red Utrecht
  velvet, two more <i>bergères</i>, covered with <i>dauphine</i> with a white
  ground, six armchairs with crimson damask cushions, a desk-chair in red
  morocco, two rosewood commodes with marble tops, a table of acacia wood
  covered with books, a veneered cupboard, a sideboard of cherry wood, a desk
  in rosewood and a desk in satinwood, filled the centre of the room.</p>

  <p>A little dining-table of acacia wood, one of the same for books, a
  rosewood coffer, footstools and cushions completed the furniture.</p>

  <p>The walls in between the mirror were covered with prints, framed in gilt
  or black wood; several subjects in mezzotint after M. Greuze, <i>La
  Lecture</i> and <i>La Conversation Espagnol</i> by Beauvarlet, <i>Ruines
  Romaines</i> by Dietrich, and several portraits, among which were M.
  D'Alembert and M. Turgot.</p>

  <p>Between the windows stood a cylinder desk of satinwood, furnished with
  candlesticks, snuffers, and tinderbox in silvered brass, and above were four
  shelves of books.</p>

  <p>This desk, adorned with ormolu, was Julie's special property, and held two
  locked portfolios and several books.</p>

  <p>An elegant spinning-wheel and a work-table occupied one corner; on the
  sideboard stood a few silver dishes, a package of sweets, and a decanter.</p>

  <p>All the chairs were low and easy and filled with cushions in brocade,
  mostly red and green, of damask and Utrecht velvet. The room, though too full
  of furniture, had an air of comfort and ease, of elegance and leisure. At the
  far end an inner door led into the bed-chamber. This, with a dressing-closet
  and the room of her maid, completed the suite on this floor.</p>

  <p>Above, on the next floor, were the rooms of the other servants, the
  kitchen and several empty closets.</p>

  <p>Above that lived one or two other lodgers of the master joiner, among whom
  was M. D'Alembert, joint editor of the Encyclopaedia, perpetual secretary of
  the Academy, as a mathematician second to none, as writer and philosopher
  second only to M. Voltaire. He had long been the great attraction of the
  <i>salon</i> in the Convent, of Saint-Joseph and the dearest friend of its
  blind mistress, the Marquise du Deffand.</p>

  <p>When the bitter quarrel arose between this lady and Julie, her companion
  and secretary, the Marquise had offered her old friend his choice between her
  and Mademoiselle de Lespinasse. The great man had unhesitatingly chosen the
  woman whom he had secretly adored since he had first beheld her, and had
  taken his presence, his prestige, his brilliant following, to the new
  <i>salon</i> in the rue Saint-Dominique, thereby causing the lonely and
  bitter old Marquise to hate him furiously with but little less of the
  violence which she accorded to the rebellious Julie.</p>

  <p>Soon after this secession, Mademoiselle de Lespinasse fell ill of the
  smallpox, that disease which nearly ruined her health and completely ruined
  her looks. The famous philosopher had proved himself the most anxious, the
  most devoted of friends. It was largely owing to his intense care that Julie
  survived her terrible illness. His self-sacrifice nearly cost him his life;
  he caught the hideous complaint against which his feeble frame could ill
  struggle. Julie nursed him with complete self-abnegation, and on his recovery
  insisted that he should leave the close, miserable garret in the house of his
  foster-mother where he had hitherto spent his life. A temporary lodging was
  found for him in the hotel of M. Watelet, in the Boulevard du Temple, but the
  impulsive, warm-heartedness of Julie insisted that he should make his
  residence under her roof. The man, who regarded her with a secret, tenacious,
  and hopeless affection, caught eagerly at this half-happiness which was so
  much more than he had ever dreamed to obtain, and, with a pleasure and pride
  unspeakable, took up his residence in the rue Saint-Dominique. He shared his
  meals with Julie and used her <i>salon</i> to receive his friends, acted as
  her secretary when her sight troubled her, ran her errands, and was
  completely at her service. He was always present on her famous Tuesdays, and
  it was very rarely that he did not accompany her to dinner, supper, to the
  theatre, opera or fête&mdash;seldom was one asked without the other.</p>

  <p>This singular relationship was respected by a world where sentiment was
  allowed so high a value and passion had been almost civilised out of
  existence&mdash;at least, out of recognition. Julie de Lespinasse, at any
  rate, was regarded as a woman sufficiently remarkable to do as she pleased,
  and the perfect calm and frankness with which she filled her unconventional
  role would in any case have disarmed criticism.</p>

  <p>If it was obvious that M. D'Alembert was most single-heartedly in love
  with her, it was also obvious that she was not in love with him&mdash;and,
  indeed, the philosopher, fifty-four years of age, frail and effeminate in
  appearance, sickly and feeble, with his high voice and plain face, was hardly
  likely to be the object of a romantic passion, and his life had passed
  without the shadow of a love affair.</p>

  <p>The radiant Julie, sure of her own heart, secure in her position, slightly
  defiant towards a world that had given her so much but withheld so much,
  cared nothing if her action caused comment or no.</p>

  <p>'Eh,' she said proudly, 'when one is old and plain, one may do as one
  likes.' And she merely smiled at the thought of the weapon she had given to
  the black spite of Madame du Deffand.</p>

  <p>The deep and honest devotion of M. D'Alembert touched her deeply; he had
  nothing to offer her beyond his fame; his birth was as blotted as her own,
  his story as sad, his past as painful, his means yet more restricted and
  uncertain, his health as feeble, and he had never put himself forward as a
  pretender to her favour&mdash;the infinite tact of Julie had spared him that.
  But every instant of his life was at her service, all his thoughts were for
  her. No duty, no office was too humble, if it was to pleasure her, and he
  accepted with humble gratitude the high place she had offered him in her
  friendship.</p>

  <p>He did not really understand this woman whom he adored. Perhaps no nature
  so calm and tenacious could understand one so passionate and changeful, but
  he thought that he comprehended her every emotion, and that her whole heart
  lay bare to him. He knew that she was debarred from marriage by the same
  reason that he was, and he believed that the tender affection she accorded
  him was all she had to give to any man. He did not see the compassion in her
  gentle acceptance of his all; he did not guess how the woman in her was
  soothed by his attentions; that his brilliant company relieved hours of
  bitter loneliness, that her feminine vanity was flattered to think that there
  was always one heart in which she reigned supreme.</p>

  <p>Certainly M. D'Alembert understood more about geometry than women, and was
  very "completely deceived in the complex character of Julie de
  Lespinasse."</p>

  <p>Passionate, sensitive, born and educated under a cloud, terribly hurt
  again and again, always homeless, without relatives, dependent, conspicuous,
  yet set apart from others, with a vast capacity for suffering, she found in
  the rue Saint-Dominique something of what other people took for granted, but
  what she had never had&mdash;her own domain, liberty, security, a permanent
  refuge, and in M. D'Alembert something of that warm atmosphere of homely
  affection that hitherto she had missed. Her eager kindness to the man who
  gave her these sensations of secured happiness had to the infatuated
  philosopher the aspect of love, and he lived in the rosy illusion of being
  the first object of her heart.</p>

  <p>Julie de Lespinasse had once been in love.</p>

  <p>A noble Irishman, M. Taafe, whom she had met in the <i>salon</i> of
  Saint-Joseph, had inspired her with a capricious and violent fancy. The brief
  enchantment was dispelled by the grim irony of Madame du Deffand; the
  <i>demoiselle de compagnie</i> was made to understand that she was not to
  have feelings, and neither love nor marriage were for the dowerless, disowned
  girl.</p>

  <p>Jealousy barbed these stinging truths. The tongue of the blind Marquise
  was a terrible, if delicate, weapon, and Julie had been wounded to the quick,
  and most of all by the fact that the Irishman had proved no persistent lover,
  but had desisted at the first rebuff, and soon afterwards left Paris, never
  to return.</p>

  <p>A more reserved, a prouder Julie, rose from the overthrow of that first
  despair. Her friendships were numerous and famous, her attraction was
  universally acknowledged; she was called 'enchantress,' but she had had no
  more love affairs until, at an age when she fondly believed life had passed
  her by, she was drawn, almost despite herself, into the unhappy, violent, and
  doomed affection that now filled her entire life. Her marvellous friendships
  were not all with men; many women were under the empire of her charm, and to
  them she was loyal, frank, and devoted. Madame de Luxembourg, Madame de
  Chatillon, Madame de Boufflers were among her intimates, and for Madame
  Geoffrin she had a filial affection, and admitted her into her entire
  confidence. It was to this lady, whose <i>salon</i> was the most famous in
  Paris, that Julie owed the support that made it possible for her, alone,
  poor, and unplaced as she was, to open a <i>salon</i> that could compete
  with, and finally outshine, those held in the splendid hotel of the rue
  Saint-Clery, that of the Baron D'Holbach and those of Madame du Deffand and
  Madame Geoffrin herself.</p>

  <p>So great was the devotion of these two brilliant women for each other,
  that the bitter jealousy of the daughter of the Marquise was roused, and so,
  in a measure, the friendship spoiled for Julie. The beautiful Comtesse de
  Boufflers, fresh and seductive, though no younger than Julie, had been her
  generous champion in the break with Madame du Deffand, and remained her close
  friend, though not her confidante. Madame de Marchais, lovely and witty, a
  lady of the Court, a coquette, despite her life-long attachment to the Comte
  D'Angeviller, and the Duchesse de Chatillon were next among the women of
  Julie's circle. This last, dowered with all the gifts of fortune, behaved as
  a tender sister to Julie, who, however, had never admitted her to any great
  intimacy. Three men came next to M. D'Alembert among those whom she
  loved&mdash;the Marquis de Condorcet, whom she called her second secretary,'
  M. Suard, the writer, for whom she was using her vast influence to obtain a
  seat in the Academy, and the Chevalier de Chastellux.</p>

  <p>No trace of sentiment entered into her relations with any of these. M.
  Condorcet was nursing a hopeless passion for the fascinating Mademoiselle
  D'Ussé, M. Suard was in love with his wife, de Chastellux was unalterably
  attached to the Marquise de Géon. In all these affairs she was their
  confidante, and in return opened her inmost heart to them. Her genius for the
  platonic friendship found expression also with M. Turgot, whom she called 'my
  minister,' with the Marquis de Caraccioli, the ambassador of Naples at Paris,
  with David Hume, whose historic quarrel with Rousseau had been settled under
  her arbitration, and the Earl of Shelburne.</p>

  <p>Among others who frequented her modest room, and who were of her near
  acquaintance, were such men as the Abbé Galiani, Marmontel, Grimm, the Comte
  de Cruetz, the Baron de Gleichen, and the Comte d'Aranda. So, under her
  light, gay, and easy rule, gathered thinkers, soldiers, statesmen,
  scientists, wits, men of fashion, beauties, great ladies, famous foreigners,
  all enthralled alike by her exquisite culture, her unfailing intelligence and
  tact, her natural enthusiasm, her unaffected delight in all aspects of life
  and art, the enchantment of her delicious personality. Her lack of youth and
  beauty had never stood in her way; women of middle age were the fashion, and
  the gifts of youth could not show to advantage in the atmosphere of the
  <i>salons</i>; beauty was at a discount in an over-civilised society that
  permitted only nuances of sentimental affection and platonic relationships
  that were tacitly supposed to supersede the crudeness and violence of
  passion, the natural storms of early love. Julie had no young girl among her
  acquaintances. Her friends were nearly all older than herself. Those who were
  not, Madame de Marchais and Madame de Chatillon, were not seen very
  frequently in her company. She knew herself unique, both in her history, her
  personality and the position she had achieved, and without in the least
  losing her head, she abandoned herself to the delights of her friendships,
  the adulation, the fame, the praise, the round of visits, of entertainments,
  the gay, easy exchange of thought with the finest minds of the time, the
  delicious intimacy with her slave, D'Alembert, with Condorcet, with Suard,
  the celebrity of her Tuesdays, the pleasure of literary labour, of music, of
  which she was passionately fond, of plenty of clothes, in which direction she
  had always been starved, with that eager fervour that was her main
  characteristic. And her youth was past when she began gradually to find that
  the fame was becoming meaningless, the laughter hollow, the gaiety forced,
  the friendships limited, the wit stale.</p>

  <p>Restlessness and melancholy afflicted her attitude to all the things that
  had at one time been such a source of avid enjoyment to her: she murmured in
  her soul, '<i>A quoi bon</i>?' Some deep instinct told her that her life,
  outwardly so frank and natural, was in reality artificial, that her days,
  seemingly so full, were, in truth, empty, that, having in appearance had
  everything, she had really had nothing.</p>

  <p>Her old love of children began to stir in her heart with a torturing pang.
  She had the nostalgia for the home she had never known, a longing and a
  yearning for she knew not what.</p>

  <p>Tears were close behind her laughter, and she faced the future with
  terrified eyes. It was when she was falling into this mood of weariness that
  was near despair that she met the Marquis de Mora.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">Jose Y Gonzaga Pignatelli D'Arragon, Marquis de Mora, was
  the son of the Comte de Fuentès, Spanish Ambassador at Paris, and one of the
  most remarkable of the foreigners who were admitted into the exclusive
  circles of Parisian society.</p>

  <p>Before he was twenty, he had been married and widowed, and had been
  introduced to Paris by his father, then in the full éclat of the <i>Pacte du
  famille</i>. The young Marquis and his two resplendent companions, the
  Ambassador's secretaries, the Chevalier Fernando Magellon and the Duc de
  Villa-Hermosa, soon shone at every fête, <i>salon</i>, and entertainment,
  both in Paris and at the Court, where the Comte de Fuentès was highly
  favoured.</p>

  <p>M. de Mora, in his first youth, handsome, gallant, highly-placed, made an
  instant success among the people to whom he was introduced; he became a man
  of wit, of fashion, interested in the new ideas, admiring the Encyclopedia, a
  frequenter of those gatherings where philosophy and the questions of the day
  were discussed.</p>

  <p>Men like D'Alembert and Condorcet admitted him to their intimacy; he was a
  regular visitor in the house in the rue Saint-Dominique, and Mademoiselle de
  Lespinasse had already discovered an affection for him when he was recalled
  to his regiment and abruptly left Paris.</p>

  <p>Refusing his family's wish for his re-marriage with his cousin, dona
  Félicité d'Egmont Pignatelli, M. Mora, as soon as he returned to Madrid, fell
  under the charm of the widowed dona Mariana de Silva, duchesse de Huescar,
  one of the most cultured and beautiful women of the Spanish capital. This
  affection was defeated by the family of de Fuentès, who used their influence
  to have the young colonel sent to Catalonia.</p>

  <p>At this time the first great sorrow of his life fell on him in the death
  of his only son by smallpox.</p>

  <p>A melancholy settled on the impetuous, ardent spirit of M. de Mora; his
  health became weakened; he sought restlessly for distraction, for
  consolation, and less than two years after his departure, returned to Paris.
  Young as he was, he had now, like Julie de Lespinasse, entered into a phase
  of disgust of life, of ironical observation of others, of cynical melancholy.
  The pleasures that had once so entranced him, and that now could hardly
  distract him, seemed to him trifling and unworthy.</p>

  <p>Neither did the philosophers and the men of learning any longer divert him
  from contemplating his own empty heart. Like Julie he said <i>&gt;a quoi
  bon</i>? to everything. Neither the easy love affairs, nor the sentimental
  friendships then the fashion, appealed to him any longer&mdash;he was jaded
  with both.</p>

  <p>It was while in this mood that he again met Julie de Lespinasse, and these
  two natures, so much alike, these two sensitive, passionate, restless,
  unsatisfied hearts, united in a flame of ardent passion. The beautiful dawn
  of a love that made earth a paradise for these two creatures was ended by the
  recall of the Marquis to his regiment.</p>

  <p>They swore eternal fidelity, and he declared that henceforth the one
  object of his life would be to obtain the consent of his family to their
  union. He soon returned, escorting his sister, Maria Manuela Pignatelli, who
  had been married by proxy to his bosom friend, the Duc de Villa Hermosa,
  still resident at the Spanish Embassy at Paris.</p>

  <p>The idyll of the lovers was renewed; their betrothal was believed by their
  friends to be certain. Both Condorcet and Suard were confidants of Julie's
  love story&mdash;only D'Alembert remained blind, with the blindness of a
  dogged belief. It was also known, however, that there were almost
  unsurmountable obstacles to such a marriage; the family who had not
  considered the Duchesse de Huescar good enough for their heir were not likely
  to accept Julie de Lespinasse.</p>

  <p>The de Fuentès received Julie with all respect, honour, and kindness, but
  M. de Mora could not get them even to listen to his proposal of an
  engagement, and the bride, the new Duchesse de Villa Hermosa was Julie's
  jealous enemy. The lovers, in the strength of their deep attachment, were not
  daunted, and renewed their secret understanding. But again M. de Mora had to
  bend to military authority and the wishes of his parents. He was sent back to
  Spain, despite his protests, and made Brigadier-General, with a post at the
  Spanish Court.</p>

  <p>The congratulation of the family at their success was speedily changed to
  chagrin, for the Marquis resigned from the army, put his affairs in order,
  and despite all the efforts of his friends, made every preparation to return
  to Paris and Julie de Lespinasse. The ill-health that he had given as a
  reason for his resignation, proved to be but too real an excuse: the very day
  was fixed for his departure when his lingering malady reached a violent
  crisis. A long and terrible fever was followed by a succession of fainting
  fits, and as soon as he had gained a little strength, his doctors ordered him
  at once to Valencia, whose exquisite climate, they declared, offered him his
  one chance of complete recovery. With despair in his heart he was forced to
  take this advice, and was conducted to the residence of the younger brother
  of the Duc de Villa Hermosa, in Valencia. During this, to him, painful exile,
  his one consolation was the correspondence with Julie de Lespinasse, who, in
  her turn, lived only for his letters. Encouraged by the extraordinary
  improvement of his health in the delicious air of Valencia, the impatience of
  M. de Mora soon broke through the restraints imposed on him by his doctors,
  and the prudence counselled by his friends. Resisting their endeavours with a
  violence almost cruel, he returned to Paris and resumed his place among those
  fascinating companions he had twice been forced to abandon. He was more than
  ever sought after, admired, flattered, and praised; with something of the
  ardour of his first youth he returned to the gaieties of the Court, the
  reunions with the thinkers and wits, the dinners, the suppers, the fêtes, the
  opera. But all this was because his love for Julie illuminated everything for
  him, because he was in her company every day and almost all day, and because
  all his energies were bent on accomplishing their marriage. When he was
  obliged to go to Fontainebleau on a summons from the Court, he wrote to Julie
  every morning and every evening. During his ten days' absence she received
  twenty-two letters. This life, this emotion, the heavy air of Paris, soon
  undermined the frail health of M. de Mora. He had several fresh attacks when
  his life was considered in danger, and though in his happiness he affected to
  treat these with indifference, they caused the heart of Julie to faint with
  fear. Finally, he was ordered to take the waters at Bagnères, and the lovers
  were again separated. But this was as nothing compared to what was before
  them. The Comte de Fuentès, with finances exhausted by his costly sojourn at
  Versailles, and his wife falling into a state of health even more precarious
  than that of her son, obtained leave to return for a time to Madrid, and
  commanded that M. de Mora should accompany him when he had completed the
  season at Bagnères. The condition of Madame de Fuentès making a refusal on
  the part of her son impossible, Julie had to prepare herself for an
  indefinite separation.</p>

  <p>M. de Mora, however, coloured the future with a rosy hue. He had no fears
  on the score of his health, the eternal hopefulness characteristic of his
  malady re-assuring him on that point, and he resolved to use this obligatory
  return to Madrid to strain every effort to obtain the consent of his family
  to his union with Julie and to return to Paris only as her promised
  husband.</p>

  <p>Both this project and the state of his health Julie regarded with
  something near despair; her tempestuous nature, to which moderation was
  impossible, and which had been fiercely awakened by passion to the full
  extent of sensitiveness, suffered agonies of fear and apprehension,
  melancholy and grief. She struggled to be resigned, to believe in the future,
  that the love of M. de Mora so tenderly painted for her, and in no way did
  she endeavour to prevent his departure. This was fixed for July, and during
  the few weeks that remained to her before the dreadful hour of separation,
  she was denied even the pleasure of his company, since he was obliged to
  remain at Bagnères. To add to her distress, she had to conceal her emotion
  from M. D'Alembert and from most of her friends; her spiritual loneliness was
  not the least of her griefs, and her health, never strong, began to give way
  beneath the burden of her agitation and sorrow.</p>

  <p>It was precisely at this moment that she had met M. de Guibert at the fête
  of M. Watelet.</p>

  <p>The news from Bagnères had been better than usual, the May day enchanting,
  and, in a desperate effort at distraction, she had gone to 'le Moulin Joli,'
  hoping to find among scenes that at one time she had found so fascinating,
  some relief from the perpetual grief that gnawed at her heart. But she had
  been unable to mingle with the company formerly so dear to her; her wandering
  apart had caused her meeting with M. de Guibert and that conversation that
  had for a short while dissipated her melancholy. A month had passed, mostly
  in seclusion for Julie, and she had not seen M. de Guibert again, nor had she
  thought much of him, her mind being entirely occupied by M. de Mora.</p>

  <p>It was for him she was waiting this afternoon in her little <i>salon</i>,
  seated at the cylinder desk of satinwood, on which her elbows rested, her
  elegant head drooping in her hand. She wore a robe and petticoat of fine
  white muslin, scattered with little bunches of pale flowers; over this a
  <i>negligé</i> of striped crimson and white linen, sleeves from elbow to
  wrist of ruffled lace, the same at her bosom, and a band of narrow black
  ribbon, which was sewn with tiny silk flowers, round her neck. A fine gold
  watch and two little hearts, one of gold and one of crystal filled with hair
  was fastened at her waist by a fine steel chain; she wore also a chatelaine,
  the various little objects being of ivory and silver, in green leather cases.
  Her hair was powdered, dressed close to her head, with tiny roll curls above
  the ears, and covered on the top with a small lace cap.</p>

  <p>In the folds of the fichu that crossed her bosom was a small, closely-tied
  bunch of jasmine. Exquisite care had disguised the ravages of the disease
  that had stolen her freshness; her face showed of the frail pallor due to
  artificial whitening; her large and expressive dark eyes were improved by the
  delicate pencilling of her sweeping brows; her lips were touched with pale
  carmine. Her whole appearance had that elegant and delicious finish of a
  woman who, though too sensible to be vain and not fortunate enough to be
  beautiful, is too fastidious to be careless. Julie though, as always, without
  jewellery&mdash;she possessed none but the merest trifles, a pair of steel
  buckles, a pair of paste buckles, a necklace of red wooden beads, two silver
  brooches, such things as these were her sole treasures&mdash;wore an
  expensive gown, and in every detail was the great lady. The dark eyes, heavy
  with sleeplessness and unshed tears, stared at the books on the shelves in
  front of her. They were all her familiar friends and had often proved her
  greatest comfort.</p>

  <p>There was the <i>Voyage d'Italie</i> in many volumes, by the engraver,
  Charles Cochin, all the works of Voltaire, the dramatic poems of Philippe
  Quinalt, Moresi's French and English Dictionary, the <i>Letters of Madame de
  Sévigné</i>, <i>The Cours d'Études du Prince de Parma</i>, <i>The
  Bibliothèque de Campagne</i>, the <i>Caractères of Theophrastus</i>, and
  Robertson's <i>History of Charles V</i>. and Richardson's <i>Clarissa
  Harlow</i>, both in English, and the last almost the gospel of Julie, so akin
  to her peculiar temperament was the mingled passion and sentiment, swooning
  delicacies and crude violences, the refined emotions, the tempests of
  feeling, the distracting intricacies of the melancholy tragedy of this
  extraordinary romance.</p>

  <p>Her distracted gaze fell on the gilt lettering of the title now, and her
  slender hands went to select one of the forty volumes in which the English
  novel was set forth, when the door gently opened, and M. de Mora stood within
  the room. Julie rose, and held out her hands without a word. She had
  contrived to send away the docile and unsuspecting D'Alembert, and her lackey
  had had orders to admit M. de Mora and no one else. The young Spaniard kissed
  her hands, then sank on to the Utrecht velvet ottoman which stood just inside
  the door facing the windows. He was very breathless and smiled without being
  able to speak. Julie sat down beside him, still holding his hands, which were
  cold and damp, in hers; she bent forward and warmly kissed his hollow
  cheek.</p>

  <p>'Julie!' he gasped. 'Julie!'</p>

  <p>His gaze continued to rest on her with an intensity of affection that
  seemed half-pleading and was wholly touching.</p>

  <p>'You came up the stairs too fast,' murmured Julie. '<i>Mon Dieu</i>! how
  this illness frightens me!'</p>

  <p>M. de Mora had now recovered his voice, but it was rough and continually
  broken by coughs. He paused, too, now and then, as if the act of speaking
  distressed him, and no colour returned to his pallid face.</p>

  <p>'The doctors did not want to let me come to-day,' he said, using perfect
  French. '<i>Ciel</i>! do they want to kill me? <i>I could not have lived any
  longer without seeing you</i>.'</p>

  <p>'You should not have come!' cried Julie. 'The shaking of the carriage has
  hurt you.'</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>'Indeed, I am better. Why should we talk of it now? Look at me and tell me
  if you love me!'</p>

  <p>'If I love you!' exclaimed Julie, with a sob in her voice. 'But I will get
  you some wine&mdash;something&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Grasping her two hands, he held her down on the ottoman.</p>

  <p>'Do not leave me&mdash;I want you&mdash;just you, Julie.'</p>

  <p>She made no attempt to move, she gazed at him with her soul in her eyes.
  He had been an extremely handsome man of the pronounced Southern type;
  slight, supremely elegant, of a beautiful carriage, with a clear, olive skin,
  aquiline features, a full mouth and magnificent eyes under sweeping brows;
  thick hair, naturally waving, of so dense a black as to defy powder and
  pomade. Only a slight heaviness in the nostrils of the hawk-like nose, a hint
  of coarseness in the lips, prevented the face from having been beautiful, and
  it had been lit by a fire, a changing expression, a light, an eagerness more
  attractive than perfections of line and colour.</p>

  <p>Most of this penetrating charm was now gone. He was thin to emaciation, he
  stooped slightly, and his chest was noticeably narrowed.</p>

  <p>His traits were equally disfigured: an unhealthy paleness overspread his
  hollow face, his forehead was bedewed with damp, his lips were dry and
  colourless; the gleaming black hair did not need so much powder now, for it
  was thickly sprinkled with gray.</p>

  <p>Only his eyes, in their dark fire, remained unchanged; the sweeping lashes
  were almost unnaturally long and thick, and this one beauty redeemed his
  ruined countenance. Always magnificent and precise in his dress, he was still
  attired with rich, if sombre, splendour.</p>

  <p>His dark blue velvet coat was heavily embroidered with gold, his waistcoat
  was of embroidery, his black silk stock fastened with a diamond brooch, his
  hair waved, rolled and powdered, and fastened by a sapphire blue ribbon. The
  flatness of his chest and the thinness of his hands were disguised by full
  ruffles of Spanish lace; he was perfumed with an odour of sandalwood, shaved
  to the blood, and powdered.</p>

  <p>'You are not better!' cried Julie at length. <i>Mon Dieu</i>, but this is
  frightful&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Hush, you must not say these things,' he replied faintly, but smiling.
  'Where are those good friends of mine, the little dog and the paroquet?'</p>

  <p>'I sent the dog out with D'Alembert,' said Julie. 'And did you not notice
  the paroquet in the antechamber? I put him there that his voice might not
  deafen you.'</p>

  <p>These words were hardly finished before a slight convulsion passed over
  her face, and she quickly buried it in the crimson cushions, and burst into
  tears.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">M. De Mora rose and paced up and down the shining floor,
  glancing at Julie with a sorrow that knew not how to console another
  sorrow.</p>

  <p>'Do you not believe that I shall return to you?' he said at last, in
  accents vibrant with feeling.</p>

  <p>'<i>Ciel!</i> as if I doubted you!' sobbed Julie from the cushions.</p>

  <p>'And you believe&mdash;you understand&mdash;that I have the best of
  reasons for my departure? That I must, at all costs, recover my health for
  your sake&mdash;that I must achieve our marriage soon?'</p>

  <p>'You have the best of reasons,' she agreed. Do you think I blame you?'</p>

  <p>She looked up, pressing a handkerchief to her lips; her tear-filled eyes
  looked over it, intense with love and terror.</p>

  <p>'But I am frightened,' she added. 'Frightened of the future&mdash;three
  hundred leagues apart&mdash;and your illness&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Do not think of that,' he replied hastily. 'I was blooded twice last
  night, and it has left me a little weak.'</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he sat down on the red morocco chair in front of Julie's desk
  with the air of one who has not strength to stand. His face was now in the
  full light of the window, and to Julie it looked like that of a dying
  man.</p>

  <p>'After all, why need you go?' she cried impetuously in her pain. 'There
  are better doctors in Paris&mdash;you know that M. Lorry is worth all the
  physicians in Spain.'</p>

  <p>M. de Mora replied gently,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'There is the question of our marriage, Julie. Once in Madrid I can press
  that.'</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle de Lespinasse rose, her lovely figure dad in the flowing,
  delicate fabrics outlined against the red ottoman.</p>

  <p>'Our marriage she said in a kind of hasty passion. 'That has been your
  torment for six years&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'My hope, my solace,' he interrupted, eagerly and warmly.</p>

  <p>'The Fuentès will never consent,' replied Julie, with heaving bosom. 'Why
  should they? <i>Grand Dieu</i>, why?'</p>

  <p>'They shall They must!' said M. de Mora, with the weary persistency of a
  sick man. He put his hand to his head and frowned.</p>

  <p>'They never will!' answered Julie. She spoke with painful
  clear-sightedness. 'What am I that your family should accept me?'</p>

  <p>'The most admired woman in Paris.'</p>

  <p>Julie lifted her shoulders.</p>

  <p>'That means so little! I know people caress me, flatter me&mdash;marry me,
  no! All my life I have been made to feel I am&mdash;apart!'</p>

  <p>'Julie!' cried M. de Mora. 'How can you speak of these things now?'</p>

  <p>'I must speak of them&mdash;they are always in my heart, <i>mon
  ami</i>.'</p>

  <p>'Then I have failed,' he returned, sadly and wistfully.</p>

  <p>'You! my dearest and my love, the noblest, the truest of men If you have
  failed&mdash;<i>mon Dieu</i>!&mdash;you have made me so happy that I have not
  known how to live! Only I must think that I have nothing to give in
  return!'</p>

  <p>She stood facing him, her hands clasped on her bosom, her whole body
  quivering, taut with her feeling.</p>

  <p>'I am forty years old&mdash;I am ugly&mdash;I am sad&mdash;I am
  penniless&mdash;I am nameless. You are young&mdash;a Spanish grandee.'</p>

  <p>The Marquis interrupted.</p>

  <p>'I love you, and that makes us equal in all.'</p>

  <p>Still she was not satisfied.</p>

  <p>'Do you know who I am?' she asked restlessly. 'My Julie.'</p>

  <p>'You evade me.'</p>

  <p>'What do I care who you are?'</p>

  <p>'All these years that you have known me, you have never asked.'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'No one has told you?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>! it is an ugly story!'</p>

  <p>'Julie,' said M. de Mora gently, 'why think of it?'</p>

  <p>'Think of it!' she replied passionately. 'Do you imagine that because I
  never speak of it I ever forget? It is part of my life&mdash;it is my life!
  It is what your family throw at you when you speak of marrying me!'</p>

  <p>M. de Mora looked at her with concern. An unhealthy colour began to flame
  in his cheeks, and he rested his hot head in his hand. Julie turned about and
  pulled at the cushions on the ottoman; her piquant profile was towards him,
  and his tired glance dwelt on it with infinite love.</p>

  <p>'My brother, the Comte D'Albon,' she said, 'has heard rumours of our
  affection. He is so afraid that on the occasion of a marriage I might claim
  my mother's name and a portion of the family fortunes, that he has called a
  council at Forez, and asked lawyers what claims I have. <i>Mon Dieu</i>!' she
  added, with stormy pride, 'how little they know me. Nothing to me, neither
  name nor money, is worth a moment's consideration beside your happiness!'</p>

  <p>'How does all this affect my happiness, Julie, save only in so far as it
  saddens you?' replied M. de Mora tenderly.</p>

  <p>'I want you to know,' she replied, without looking round. 'I often wished
  to speak to you&mdash;but I was too happy. Now that you are leaving
  me&mdash;to fight for this marriage which would be untold joy for me&mdash;I
  want you to know&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I was aware that your mother was the Comtesse d'Albon, Julie,' said the
  Marquis, half-sadly, as if he regretted that she should insist on speaking on
  this subject.</p>

  <p>'I suppose every one knows that,' replied Julie with some bitterness. 'I
  loved her, Pepe. She loved me, and took me to live with her at d'Avanges, but
  she never would&mdash;never dared&mdash;acknowledge me. I did not know who I
  was. She educated me, she caressed me, she wept over me, she flattered
  me&mdash;and then she died, leaving me to learn the truth.'</p>

  <p>Her tone softened, her head drooped, and she spoke with a regret that went
  too deep for bitterness.</p>

  <p>'The Comtesse gave me the key of a chest full of money&mdash;I was
  proud&mdash;I gave it to my brother, Camillo. My mother had dared leave me
  nothing but a pension of a few crowns. <i>Mon ami</i>! I was an object of
  charity! My sister, Diana, was married to the Comte Gaspard de Vichy.'</p>

  <p>Julie paused at this name and glanced at M. de Mora, but it meant nothing
  to him. Sadly he waited for her to continue.</p>

  <p>'I went to live with them at Champrond. I became the governess of her
  children&mdash;unpaid, unwanted, in the way&mdash;the butt for their humours.
  They told me who I was&mdash;'</p>

  <p>She paused, and drew a deep breath.</p>

  <p>'I loved the children&mdash;especially little Abel&mdash;I love him still.
  For the rest, suffering, sorrow, humiliations, degradations! M. de Vichy's
  sister, Madame du Deffand, came to Champrond; she asked me to go to Paris
  with her&mdash;she was blind&mdash;she saw in me'&mdash;here Julie's voice
  was very bitter&mdash;'a useful slave. I had been well-trained for the part.
  I could not accept&mdash;I had no money&mdash;I wrote to my brother, and was
  refused.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i> I' said M. de Mora.</p>

  <p>'Oh, I am telling you nothing,' cried Julie hastily. 'Nothing! Why should
  I tell you what will sadden you? There are'&mdash;she added with a shudder,
  'horrors in my history Why should you know of them&mdash;and&mdash;I could
  tell them to none!'</p>

  <p>She looked at him tenderly; she was thinking that he would hardly be able
  to understand her story, even if he knew every detail&mdash;he whose birth
  was undisputed, whose position had always been secure, whose means had ever
  been sufficient for his desires.</p>

  <p>'Till the day I left Madame du Deffand, I was never happy,' she said
  quietly, 'though I tried to persuade myself I was, to console myself with the
  <i>brouhaha</i> of society&mdash;then, when I was free, I was content
  awhile&mdash;with the true friendship of D'Alembert. Then, <i>mon ami</i>,
  when I met you, when I knew that you loved me, then I also knew what it was
  to be happy.'</p>

  <p>She turned to him with a frank look of love and her eyes shone with
  gratitude.</p>

  <p>'Whatever I suffer now,' she added, 'I have to thank you for six years of
  joy! Eh, it is a common thing to be loved if one is young and lovely and
  rich; it is a great triumph to be loved if one is poor and plain and
  old!'</p>

  <p>M. de Mora rose and came across to Julie and laid his hand gently on hers,
  which rested on the crimson cushions.</p>

  <p>She looked up at him quickly.</p>

  <p>'You cannot understand, can you? Though we have been soul to soul, you
  cannot understand?'</p>

  <p>'Is it my Julie who speaks?' he asked, with loving reproach. 'Julie de
  Lespinasse, adored by so many?'</p>

  <p>She answered swiftly,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'My friends have been wonderful! I have been loved more than I deserve! It
  is not that I meant&mdash;I have always been different,
  apart&mdash;marked.'</p>

  <p>M. de Mora would have interrupted, but Julie, pressing his hands in her
  nervous fingers, continued in her hoarse, hurrying voice that was so full of
  pain,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'You do not know what I have to look back on, how they have all of them
  made me feel what I am&mdash;the scenes&mdash;the bitterness. The only one
  who loves me, my nephew Abel, does not know the truth.'</p>

  <p>'Julie, why are you distressing yourself? <i>Mon Dieu</i>! what has any of
  this to do with you and me?'</p>

  <p>She was trembling, but she kept her voice steady, though with a great
  effort as she replied,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'I want you to know all about the woman you are going to insist on
  marrying. I want you also, <i>mon ami</i>, to understand something of that
  darkness that clouded my youth&mdash;that shadows me even now&mdash;the
  secret of my connection with Madame du Deffand.'</p>

  <p>'Her brother, the Comte de Vichy, was your sister's husband&mdash;one
  sought no further than that.'</p>

  <p>M. de Mora spoke gently, but in some agitation. He was not troubled so
  much by Julie's words as by her air of ill-repressed pain and confusion.</p>

  <p>'There is much further to seek,' she said, with pallid lips. 'Gaspard de
  Vichy is my father.'</p>

  <p>M. de Mora stared at her a second, then, as the full meaning of the horror
  to which she had been sacrificed came to him, he gave a little cry of
  revulsion and disgust.</p>

  <p>'You see now,' added Julie feverishly, 'that the very man who should have
  provided for me and protected me, had the strongest of reasons for ignoring
  me and thrusting me out, and why all those who should have combined to help
  me have combined to crush me&mdash;and why now there is such fear at Forez
  and Champrond lest I should claim the names of either D'Albon or de
  Vichy!'</p>

  <p>She sank on to the sofa exhausted; a fit of coughing shook her; she turned
  her face away and buried it in the cushions. With a passionate gesture, M. de
  Mora put his arm round her shaking shoulders.</p>

  <p>'What do either of these names matter to you,' he cried impetuously,
  'since you will so soon have mine?'</p>

  <p>Julie moved, lifted her head and caught hold of her lover with a movement
  that was almost convulsive.</p>

  <p>Her face was distorted, her lids swollen with hot tears.</p>

  <p>'I cannot tell&mdash;my gratitude&mdash;' she stammered.</p>

  <p>M. de Mora came beside her on the sofa and drew her to him; her head sank
  on his shoulder. She gave a little sigh; for a brief moment she again tasted
  something of the joy that had made heaven on earth for her in the early days
  of this idyll.</p>

  <p>She was absolutely sincere when she said that her gratitude was beyond
  words; it seemed to her a miracle, for which she should be thankful on her
  knees, that this man, young, noble, fêted, a hero of the <i>salons</i>,
  courted by women who possessed everything, should love her and be faithful to
  her with so pure a love and so entire a faith. That he was eager to marry her
  filled her with a devotion that she felt her entire life could not repay. No
  calculated thought, no consideration of interest, influenced her feeling. M.
  de Mora was the person dearest in the world to her tender and passionate
  heart: their characters, their tastes, were similar; they had everything in
  common save their histories. Their conception of love&mdash;elevated, noble,
  sentimental, elegant&mdash;was the same. Never had any humour, any action on
  the part of M. de Mora, offended the delicate sensibilities of Julie, and
  never had any caprice or whim on her part hurt the trusting affection of the
  Marquis.</p>

  <p>Never during the six years of their friendship that had ended in the
  secret betrothal, had either given the other cause for jealousy, despite the
  long absences, the continual opposition and obstacles in their way and the
  brilliant life each led surrounded by admirers and dear friends.</p>

  <p>Each had understood the other always, and it was this sense of complete
  security that was almost dearer to Julie than anything else. She knew that,
  from the first&mdash;whether at Versailles among the diversions of the Court,
  in Madrid with his own people, far away in Catalonia or Valencia&mdash;he was
  always hers; that he adored her every instant of his days; that he turned
  from those nearest to him at the mere thought of her; that all his life
  revolved round her, their meetings, their future union. To such a woman as
  Julie such knowledge was as the nectar of Paradise.</p>

  <p>Even her personal love for the man was not so strong 'an emotion in her
  sensitive soul as her overwhelming gratitude for what he had brought into her
  life.</p>

  <p>She lifted her head and looked at him; her thoughts were swung back to the
  present with a shock by the sudden sight of the face that looked so tenderly
  down.</p>

  <p>The agitation of her communication had shaken his frail frame; his
  complexion was the ghastly hue Of an olive skin when pale; his great Southern
  eyes were shadowed underneath with purple; he breathed with difficulty, and
  his forehead and upper lip were damp. As she looked at him he made an effort
  to smile, and the gleam of his white teeth made his colour appear yet more
  unnatural.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>!' cried Julie, while a pang of terror went through her.
  'Why do I talk of anything? You are ill and we must part&mdash;that fills the
  world for me!'</p>

  <p>She clung to him, quivering, her frail cheek was still reddened where she
  had pressed against his laces, and her jasmine sprays were crushed into
  perfume against his breast.</p>

  <p>'You must not frighten yourself, <i>mon amie</i>,' said M. de Mora, who
  had scarcely strength to speak, but who was animated by the nervous, feverish
  energy common to some forms of his disease. 'You will write&mdash;our letters
  will be the breath of life to each other.'</p>

  <p>'The Spanish post only comes in twice a week,' answered Julie. 'But I
  shall send M. D'Alembert to fetch it as soon as it reaches Paris.'</p>

  <p>'Poor M. D'Alembert!'</p>

  <p>But Julie had no thought for anything but her immediate grief.</p>

  <p>'You will never fail me?' she cried. 'You will write often?'</p>

  <p>'As if I could live without writing to you! And I shall write you the best
  of news&mdash;I shall tell you that I am recovering&mdash;that my family have
  consented, that I am returning strong and well to claim you.'</p>

  <p>He spoke sincerely, from the glamour of a sick man's illusions; those last
  hopes that gild the final stages of a mortal disease coloured his
  perspective, and he was a Southern, sanguine, impetuous, twenty-six years of
  age and deeply in love.</p>

  <p>No such rosy clouds veiled the future from Julie.</p>

  <p>Dreadful premonitions clutched at her heart. She thought she saw the
  impress of death on those features she loved so well, and that in
  surrendering him to his family she was losing him for ever.</p>

  <p>He kissed her forehead; his lips were so cold she could hardly refrain
  from a shudder; her glance fell to the frail hand that rested on her lap; it
  seemed bloodless and was dark-stained round the nails. With a movement of
  agony she rose and went restlessly to the window.</p>

  <p>M. de Mora coughed with his handkerchief to his lips. When he took it away
  he hastily crushed it into his hand that Julie might not see that it was
  stained with blood.</p>

  <p>Such a lassitude was on him that he could hardly hold his head up; he felt
  that he could face no more emotion; he would have liked to have fallen asleep
  on the ottoman, holding Julie's hand.</p>

  <p>With an effort, he picked up a volume that lay on the acacia-wood table
  near at hand.</p>

  <p>'What is this?' he asked languidly.</p>

  <p>'Why, that is M. de Guibert's forbidden book,' replied Julie
  distractedly.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">M. De Mora had gone. Julie, leaning from the window, had
  seen the carriage lumber over the cobbles on the way to Bagnères. She felt,
  indeed, that her heart went with it; never had the familiar room seemed so
  cramped, so dull. The place she had lived in and loved for nearly ten years
  seemed suddenly hateful to her. She flung herself into one of the low chairs
  by the window and leant her head back against the gilt pedestal that held the
  marble bird. She sat there, silent, motionless, sunk in a weary repose that
  was the reaction from her nervous excitement. She felt sick and shivering,
  and her fancy saw the future in most terrible colours. She beheld herself
  separated from M. de Mora for ever, abandoned again to that dreadful
  loneliness of the soul from which his warm love had rescued her so
  completely.</p>

  <p>With a sense of agony she recalled her bleak, starved youth in the gloomy
  Chateau of Champrond, the drudge, the outcast and object of suspicion and
  dislike, the dreary year at Lyons, still alone, apart; the change to
  Paris&mdash;still the same spites and jealousy, the same dependency, the same
  slavery; then the quarrel with Madame du Deffand that had set her
  free&mdash;the joy of liberty, the friendship of M. D'Alembert; and then the
  paradise M. de Mora's love had opened to her. If that ended, what had she
  left? She shuddered to her soul at the prospect of this black loneliness; she
  felt as if she could hardly restrain herself from rising and going after her
  lover, and telling him that they never would be separated&mdash;was it not
  madness that they should be?</p>

  <p>Why did she not go with him, defying every one&mdash;women had done such
  things? But he did not love her in that fashion; he wanted her in honour,
  proudly. Almost she wished that he had asked her to leave everything for him.
  Her lip curled as she thought of the relief of the Comte d'Albon if she
  should thus cut herself off from the world.</p>

  <p>Ah! they need not have troubled about her, begged her to be silent for the
  sake of her mother's memory, consulted in secret about her legal rights.
  Never had she cared, never would she care, for either the name or the
  fortune. It was not in her to disturb the family that had cast her out; never
  had she even considered those aspects of her case that gave her some right to
  claim herself to be demoiselle D'Albon. And those who believed that it was
  respect for her mother's memory that kept her silent were mistaken. Her
  attitude was merely a proud indifference to all questions of self-interest,
  an absorption in her own engrossing emotions.</p>

  <p>The door softly opened and a gentle step sounded on the polished floor.
  Julie moved her head impatiently and stared out of the window at the blank
  front of the house opposite. She did not wish for any interruption,
  especially this interruption. In the full tide of her happiness she had been
  more than usually kind to M. D'Alembert; then, as she became more absorbed in
  M. de Mora, indifferent to him; now, in the grief and agitation that she must
  conceal from him, he irritated her&mdash;his presence, his constant interest,
  became a fret that was almost insupportable.</p>

  <p>She tapped her foot nervously as she heard him tiptoeing across the
  room.</p>

  <p>'You are not well?' came his thin, anxious, tenor voice.</p>

  <p>Julie had to look round.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon ami</i>,' she said, struggling to be patient, 'am I ever
  well?'</p>

  <p>The great man peered at her eagerly.</p>

  <p>'But you looked so white&mdash;so fatigued! I heard you coughing as I came
  up the stairs,' he cried.</p>

  <p>Julie laid a fever-hot hand on his wrist as he stood over her; her lips
  quivered, but she strove to command herself.</p>

  <p>'I have been saying good-bye to M. de Mora&mdash;well, not good-bye, but
  he goes soon, and he is so ill and so dear&mdash;it&mdash;disturbed me.'</p>

  <p>'I should be grieved as yourself if anything happened to M. de Mora!'
  exclaimed the philosopher in all good faith.</p>

  <p>Julie's slender foot again beat on the floor. This fatuous blindness, in
  some perverse way, vexed her; it seemed hardly credible that D'Alembert could
  really be ignorant of the passion that was consuming her. It was true that
  she had made every effort to conceal it from him, but her success irritated
  her, perhaps slightly disgusted her with herself.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon ami</i>,' she said, as gently as she could, 'as you say, I am not
  very well&mdash;leave me awhile.'</p>

  <p>D'Alembert gave her a look of wistful adoration and retreated to the red
  ottoman. In his anxiety not to obtrude on her, he absently picked up the book
  M. de Mora had taken from the acacia table and left among the damask
  cushions.</p>

  <p>Julie winced to see him in her lover's place and handling the object M. de
  Mora had last touched.</p>

  <p>Her glance was almost cruel as it swept over the unconscious little man.
  Had she been in any other mood she would have seen what a piteous figure he
  was, with his big head and small, frail body, his air of shrinking timidity,
  his utter absorption in her and her affairs, his complete submission to her
  wishes&mdash;above all, his absolute trust in her fidelity to their platonic
  friendship. As it was, she merely thought: '<i>Ciel</i>, is it possible that
  a man can be so blind, so infatuated?' And wearily turned her head away again
  and stared at the strip of June sky showing above the gray houses
  opposite.</p>

  <p>D'Alembert glanced at her timidly; he had a plain, frail-looking face,
  deeply lined and colourless, but his ingenuous expression of modest goodness
  gave him an appearance of nobility.</p>

  <p>Even poorer than Julie, since he had never accepted so much from friends,
  this man, who was, after Voltaire, the most celebrated in Europe, was
  dressed, almost shabbily, in the plainest of brown suits, with nothing fine
  about him but the quality of his neat linen.</p>

  <p>He had had two great passions in his life&mdash;geometry and Julie de
  Lespinasse.</p>

  <p>For many years the first had been forgotten in the second. He was entirely
  fascinated by the enchanting woman whose friendship had been the sunshine of
  his life; it was his pride to please her. His friends had smiled to see the
  great philosopher running errands like a lackey. Lately, he had been elected
  perpetual secretary of the Academy, a post that carried with it an apartment
  in the Louvre, but D'Alembert had instantly refused to leave the humble
  chamber in the rue Saint-Dominique.</p>

  <p>Presently he glanced deprecatingly at the clock on the chimney-piece.</p>

  <p>'Shall we not dine?' he suggested humbly.</p>

  <p>'I cannot eat,' replied Julie.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>, but you are ill</p>

  <p>A fit of coughing checked her answer.</p>

  <p>'Will you see Lorry&mdash;take some medicine?'</p>

  <p>Julie struggled to control herself.</p>

  <p>'I do well enough,' she gasped. 'Take your dinner, my good
  D'Alembert.'</p>

  <p>'Nay,' he said mournfully. 'I have no appetite when you will not eat.'</p>

  <p>She could have shrieked at this obstinate devotion. Terribly did she long
  to be alone. Following out her train of thought, she said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'<i>Grand Dieu</i>, but it is dull, this apartment&mdash;like a prison!
  You are mad not to take the room in the Louvre.'</p>

  <p>'And leave you!' cried D'Alembert in pained amazement.</p>

  <p>'Ah,' she replied with gentle irony, 'you are too fond&mdash;I am not
  worthy of it&mdash;I am always ill&mdash;and full of whims.'</p>

  <p>The great man smiled tenderly; he glanced at the book in his hands.</p>

  <p>'<i>L'Essai sur la Tactique</i>,' he read out. 'Ah, what a number of
  copies have been smuggled over! You like it?'</p>

  <p>'I have not read it,' answered Julie with great weariness.</p>

  <p>D'Alembert fluttered over the pages.</p>

  <p>'You met him&mdash;this de Guibert?'</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;at Watelet's fête.'</p>

  <p>'You liked him?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, he is very charming&mdash;different from others&mdash;a soldier
  above all, I think. He said he would come here, but I have not seen him
  yet.'</p>

  <p>'It seems he is very occupied; Paris talks of nothing else. They say he is
  to save the country. Eh, well, I must read his book,' added D'Alembert
  placidly, without a shade of jealousy.</p>

  <p>'His personality makes his success, I think,' said Julie. 'He is very
  attractive, not handsome, but seductive and young. Oh, del, young as the
  gods!'</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert was too sweet-natured and too sure of Julie to find any
  sting in these words.</p>

  <p>'Ah, yes, young,' he repeated mildly. 'But,' he added, ever loyal to his
  friends, 'he is not so young as M. de Mora.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Julie, 'but&mdash;'</p>

  <p>She checked herself&mdash;she hardly knew what this 'but' implied, what
  the sharp distinction was that she had drawn between M. de Mora and M. de
  Guibert. They seemed to her as the poles apart. She frowned, puzzled, a
  little disturbed.</p>

  <p>'M. de Guibert is a soldier,' she added slowly, as if seeking for the
  solution of some difficulty.</p>

  <p>'So is M. de Mora,' replied the philosopher instantly.</p>

  <p>Julie was silent. She had never thought of her lover as a soldier, though
  he had been in the Spanish army since almost a child, and had attained a
  higher rank than the Colonel of Corsicans.</p>

  <p>'M. de Guibert has seen so much active service,' she added at length.</p>

  <p>'M. de Mora's health has handicapped him,' answered M. D'Alembert, who
  wondered why she was making so much of a small point.</p>

  <p>'Ah!' cried Julie sharply. <i>That</i> was the difference, the difference
  between sickness and health. She thought of her lover's face as she had last
  seen it, and the remembrance of M. de Guibert's radiant personality became an
  offence.</p>

  <p>She rose quickly, with a return of her late irritation. 'Oh, <i>mon
  Dieu</i>, what a day!' she shivered. 'There is no colour anywhere!'</p>

  <p>'But it is spring,' protested M. D'Alembert.</p>

  <p>'I,' said Julie de Lespinasse, 'am cold to the heart.'</p>

  <p>'Shall we not dine now?' suggested the philosopher timidly.</p>

  <p>Her strained nerves gave way. She turned on him in a little gust of
  forlorn passion.</p>

  <p>'Have I not said I will not eat? I am ill&mdash;I am tormented!'</p>

  <p>She swept past him towards her bedroom door. But M. D'Alembert could not
  let her go like this.</p>

  <p>'I will call Madame Saint Martin,' he said, putting himself in her
  way.</p>

  <p>Julie turned haggard eyes on him.</p>

  <p>'Do you imagine a chamber-woman can cure my ills?' she asked.</p>

  <p>Then at the swift look of pain that crossed his face, instant remorse
  moved her. She held out her hands to him with a charming gesture of
  penitence.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon ami</i>, forgive me. I had not any right&mdash;but if you knew how
  unhappy I am&mdash;how unhappy!'</p>

  <p>This cry, which came with the terrible sincerity of a child's lament
  against destiny, stirred and startled M. D'Alembert to the heart.</p>

  <p>'But why are you so unhappy, Julie?' he asked ingenuously.</p>

  <p>She was at once irritated again. The blindness of this devoted friend
  seemed to her sheer fatuity; perversely, she blamed him for that faith in her
  that rendered him so unconscious of the truth of her trouble.</p>

  <p>'Why am I unhappy?' she echoed, turning restlessly away again. 'You know
  what I have had to make me unhappy&mdash;what tigers I have had to deal
  with.'</p>

  <p>He knew at once that she referred to her family. No one could understand
  better the agonies of her position. No one had ever extended to her a
  tenderer sympathy than this foundling who had been abandoned on the steps of
  Saint-Jean-le-Rond by his mother, the beautiful Comtesse de Tencin, and who,
  of noble birth on both sides, had always been, like Julie, poor, nameless,
  outcast.</p>

  <p>But the evil days are past,' he said gently.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon ami</i>, they are never past for me,' replied Julie, with
  conviction. 'The Vichy and the D'Albon will never cease to hate me.'</p>

  <p>She could not tell him how the rumour of her proposed marriage had roused
  this latent fear and hatred, and how she had been doubly stabbed, both by the
  action of her brother and the steady opposition of the Fuentès family.</p>

  <p>'They think that I shall claim the title of Demoiselle D'Albon,' was all
  she could say. 'Eh, well, I have some right.'</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert could not think why she should dwell on a subject so painful
  and so seldom mentioned, nor could he connect it in any way with her grief
  for the departure of M. de Mora.</p>

  <p>She saw his bewilderment and it further increased her nervous
  vexation.</p>

  <p>'Leave me,' she implored. 'I must rest&mdash;I must think.'</p>

  <p>'Julie&mdash;you are not going to take opium?' he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>'And if I do?'</p>

  <p>'But you have promised!'</p>

  <p>'It is the one thing that calms me. I suffer and I can resist no
  longer.'</p>

  <p>'But this drug destroys you,' protested M. D'Alembert, in despair.</p>

  <p>Julie hesitated, shivered, and turned away from her bedroom door. She was
  ashamed of her weakness, but she longed for the sedative. Her head ached, her
  chest was full of pain, and every nerve in her body seemed ajar.</p>

  <p>'Dine in your room,' she said coldly to M. D'Alembert. 'I can eat nothing
  to-day.'</p>

  <p>'Then neither will I,' he replied anxiously.</p>

  <p>She moved restlessly up and down the room, her flowing skirts billowing
  with her graceful movements. His goodness exasperated her; she felt herself
  unworthy of his devotion, and was fretted by his care.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>!' she thought desperately. 'How did I come to give him
  the right to watch me?'</p>

  <p>The philosopher, well-schooled in her moods, and lately used to the bursts
  of impetuous passion, the apathy, the coldness that were the results of her
  infatuation for M. de Mora, again took up M. de Guibert's book and began once
  more to speak of the author. M. de Guibert was the topic of the day, and M.
  D'Alembert could not believe that Julie should be uninterested in the man who
  had taken Paris by storm, and who was hailed by the entire Encyclopaedia as
  their most brilliant recruit.</p>

  <p>But this subject was a fresh offence to poor Julie. She did not want to
  hear of the success of the gorgeous young soldier.</p>

  <p>'He is too much Fortune's favourite,' she said, and thoughts of M. de Mora
  made her accent bitter.</p>

  <p>'I think he justifies his fame,' replied M. D'Alembert, with the
  generosity of greatness.</p>

  <p>But Julie was almost painfully clear-sighted, even when her stormy
  emotions were around her. Fine instincts are not to be deceived, and where
  she was indifferent she could read character with exquisite exactitude. She
  had judged accurately enough the man whom she had met at 'Le Moulin Joli' for
  all the enchantment of the lovely May night.</p>

  <p>'He dazzles people with his personal gifts&mdash;he is born to be great,'
  she said. 'He will always have his own way&mdash;he takes the colour of his
  time, and will be generally admired&mdash;but I doubt if he has capacity to
  love or to suffer.'</p>

  <p>'Then he is indeed fortunate,' replied D'Alembert, with a slightly wry
  smile.</p>

  <p>'Did I not say so?' cried Julie. 'But, <i>mon Dieu</i> I do not
  know&mdash;an empty life!'</p>

  <p>'I do not think one could say that of M. de Guibert. He has as many
  gallantries as any man in Paris&mdash;and always Madame de Montsauge.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, la, la!' cried Julie impatiently. 'What is any of that but
  emptiness?'</p>

  <p>She sank into a low <i>bergère</i> by the fireplace, leaning back in an
  attitude of complete exhaustion.</p>

  <p>Her tender grace, her fragrant charm were very apparent as she lay there
  inert, in the ebb of her emotion.</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert looked with humble and utter love at the long figure, the
  small head, the tired face, the slender hands and feet, the whole person so
  delicate and exquisite, betraying in every line a rare character, both fine
  and passionate, capricious and over-sensitive, yet so intensely lovable.</p>

  <p>Her broad lids drooped, her head sunk into the cushions.</p>

  <p>With a little sigh of relief, M. D'Alembert tip-toed from the room and
  went to ask for his frugal and delayed meal.</p>

  <p>As soon as the door had closed, Julie sprang up with feverish energy,
  hurried into her bedroom, and fetched the opium.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">Julie De Lespinasse awoke from the slumber induced by the
  opium, moved slowly in the great bed, and gazed round the room. The drug had
  calmed her, she felt dazed and giddy. Lately, she had had to increase the
  dose to obtain any effect, and during her recent agitation with regard to M.
  de Mora and the subsequent effect on her own health, she had been taking
  enormous doses of opium in defiance both of her friends and her doctor. The
  habit had commenced when she was at the Convent of Saint-Joseph. Her health
  enfeebled by the painful life she led in constant attendance on Madame du
  Deffand, her spirit exasperated by the miserable scenes with her mistress
  consequent on her first thwarted love-affair, she had resort to the
  fashionable remedy of nervous and overstrung women, and had taken such a
  large quantity of opium that many believed she had permanently injured her
  already delicate constitution. When she was happy she could resist the
  dangerous sedative, but it was her only resort when her physical and mental
  sufferings became acute. Her nerves were soothed now, and she was only
  conscious of a gentle melancholy. She thought of M. D'Alembert with affection
  and was grieved that she had deceived him. Slowly she sat up. The sun had
  left the street, and faint shadows began to fill the chamber. Julie found
  that she had very little strength. She sank back on the tumbled pillows.</p>

  <p>The chamber was charming. The bed was in an alcove facing the door into
  the <i>salon</i> and curtained with hangings of dull crimson damask; the
  bed-curtains, valence, and quilt were of the same; the mattresses and pillows
  were of wool, the linen of the finest embroidery. The walls were also hung
  with this crimson damask, and the window that gave on the street was
  curtained with this material. Above the door where the polished panels
  showed, was, an oil portrait of M. the Archbishop of Toulouse in an oval
  frame of carved gilt wood, and in between the hangings were small engravings,
  mostly after Greuze, in black and gilt frames.</p>

  <p>The fireplace faced the window, the fire-dogs, grate, and furniture were
  of polished iron, ornamented with silvered brass; the chimney-piece was also
  of polished metal, supported by wrought bronze arms; either side of this
  stood a large wardrobe with drawers, in rosewood, and in front were two
  arm-chairs covered with crimson damask. In front of the window was a bureau
  of black wood and leather, with drawers and writing-materials; before it a
  tapestry chair. Next the door into the <i>salon</i> was a low dressing-table
  of polished wood, with drawers, along this being a mirror in a gilt frame,
  and in front of it was a <i>bergère</i> in green, with green cushions and two
  other chairs in crimson damask. This table, which was beautifully finished
  with metal locks and handles, held Julie's few treasures, which were
  contained in a box of painted wood, lined and finished with tortoise-shell,
  another of plain polished wood, another of red horn, and a fourth of
  tortoiseshell adorned with a medallion in a circle of gold, showing two
  cupids. A little cabinet of cardboard, lined with tortoise-shell and
  ornamented with gold, and a writing-case of rosewood, also stood on this
  table, together with two powder boxes and two dressing-cases in painted wood.
  A small table covered in green velvet, a chair in crimson Utrecht velvet, and
  a 'concessional' chair in the same, completed the furniture of the room. In
  the above, was a small walnut-table with a marble top, and a door leading
  into the dressing-room.</p>

  <p>Such was the chamber where Julie had slept for nearly ten years.</p>

  <p>At length she sat up, drew the curtains of the alcove yet farther apart,
  and let the last daylight stream over the bed. A pale beam fell over the
  opium-bottle and the glass on the bed-table, a little had fallen on the
  marble and left a faint purplish stain.</p>

  <p>Julie hastily put all away in the table-drawer and pulled the crimson
  bell-rope. Madame Saint-Martin had been expecting this summons, and came
  instantly.</p>

  <p>She was a middle-aged, elegant woman, precise in her gray gown and
  delicate muslin apron and cap; she had long been in the service of
  Mademoiselle de Lespinasse.</p>

  <p>'Mademoiselle will eat?' she asked, coming up to the alcove.</p>

  <p>Julie had fallen back on the pillows, her hair, still heavy with pomade,
  lay scattered beneath her, her frail muslin skirts, the crimson and white
  jacket, were crumpled; she had flung off her shoes, her lace cap, and the
  velvet neck-band. These lay on the polished floor beside the bed.</p>

  <p>'Yes, I am hungry,' she answered faintly, without moving.</p>

  <p>The chamber-woman saw at once what had happened.</p>

  <p>'Mademoiselle has been taking opium,' she said reproachfully.</p>

  <p>'My good Saint-Martin,' replied Julie, 'there are times when I can resist
  no longer&mdash;-eh, it matters little!'</p>

  <p>She made an effort and sat up, pressing her thin hands to her giddy head.
  'M. D'Alembert dined?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes, mademoiselle, and I have ordered some food for you which, is coming
  now.'</p>

  <p>'No one has been?'</p>

  <p>'M. de Vaines, mademoiselle, only. M. D'Alembert saw him.'</p>

  <p>The maid entered with a tray, and Julie was served on the little
  walnut-table. Some of her few pieces of silver gleamed on a snowy napkin, the
  food was well-cooked and tempting. She ate with some appetite, drank white
  wine and black coffee, and then declared she would get up. A gentle warmth
  circulated in her veins. Her spirits rose until she felt almost gay, a great
  sense of vitality animated her. The colour flushed into her face. It was
  delightful to be free from pain and to have that sense of disaster lifted
  from her spirit.</p>

  <p>'I hope some one will come to-night,' she said. 'I am in the mood for
  company. Give me a fresh gown. If no one comes I will go out.' She rose,
  vibrant with life, her whole slim body eager. She flung back her fallen hair
  and slipped off her tumbled jacket, and stood straight and elegant in her
  tight muslin bodice. 'It is as if I were expecting something,' she said.</p>

  <p>Madame Saint-Martin hastened into the dressing-room. This affectionate
  woman was delighted with the high spirits of her mistress.</p>

  <p>'Mademoiselle does not eat enough,' came her voice through the open door.
  'And mademoiselle is too sensitive. Certainly she had disturbed herself too
  much over the illness of M. de Mora.'</p>

  <p>This name caused Julie to shiver, but she quickly recovered herself. She
  felt now that it was impossible that any great misfortune was about to
  overtake her; it was May, she was beloved&mdash;why should she be haunted
  with thoughts of death and terror?</p>

  <p>Her heart leapt at the remembrance that she would see him again; and yet
  again, were there not two months to his departure? And perhaps he would not
  go at all? And if he did, why not believe that he would return safe and
  well&mdash;her betrothed husband? As the Marquise de Mora she would be
  secured against all that threatened her as Julie de Lespinasse.</p>

  <p>She went and stood at the door of the dressing-room in which Madame
  Saint-Martin had lit the candles. This little chamber was lined with polished
  wood, furnished with straw-bottomed chairs, a walnut table, and blue and
  white curtains at the two windows; engravings were on the walls, and in one
  corner was a marble basin with a metal tap and cover; to the right another
  door led to the bathroom.</p>

  <p>Julie took off her muslin gown, and stood in her white dimity petticoat
  and corset. She laid her watch and chatelaine on the walnut table, and held
  out her arms for the jacket of thin cotton with muslin ruffles that the
  chamber-woman offered her. She sat in one of the low straw chairs, which were
  filled with green cushions, while Madame Saint-Martin fetched the toilet
  articles from the bathroom.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps I shall hear from Bagnères to-morrow,' she thought.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later her maid came to tell her that some one had asked for
  her. Julie glanced at her watch.</p>

  <p>'But I am expecting no one at this hour,' she said. 'Who is it?'</p>

  <p>'M. le Comte de Guibert, mademoiselle.'</p>

  <p>Julie was now standing in a full white taffeta petticoat and tight white
  satin corset. She held an ivory mirror in her hand. Her hair was already
  dressed dose to her head, powdered and adorned with a vivid pink silk rose.
  Her eyes were very dark and shining.</p>

  <p>'Tell M. de Guibert that T will be with him immediately,' she said. Then
  glancing in the mirror, she added: 'I am glad that he came by candle-light.'
  She smiled at Madame Saint-Martin. 'Give me the rose taffeta. Did it not come
  home yesterday?'</p>

  <p>When she entered her <i>salon</i>, the last daylight had been excluded by
  the drawing of the crimson curtains, and the candles were lit. A man who
  seemed like a stranger to Julie, rose from the ottoman and looked at her in
  radiant greeting. Julie de Lespinasse gave him the tips of her frail,
  perfumed fingers.</p>

  <p>'M. de Guibert! you have chosen a day when I am dull.'</p>

  <p>'The dullness of Mademoiselle de Lespinasse is as the wit of others.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, you know me very little or you would not pay me compliments which I
  neither deserve nor like.'</p>

  <p>She stood before him smiling, fragrant and delicious in her full,
  transparent, striped white muslin, draped over her ruffled rose silk
  petticoats, with fine lace at her bosom and elbows and paste buckles gleaming
  on her white velvet shoes.</p>

  <p>'You are too early for me to be able to offer you an entertainment,' she
  smiled, 'and too late to have an excuse to leave me&mdash;so?'</p>

  <p>'So you cannot escape a little weariness, mademoiselle, and must bear with
  me with what patience you may.'</p>

  <p>'I have no patience at all,' said Julie. 'I am very stupid and very
  natural. When I am bored I yawn&mdash;when I am interested, behold me!'</p>

  <p>She seated herself on the low ottoman from which he had risen, and smiled
  up into his face. The opium was still in her veins giving her a false life;
  never had she felt farther from pain and illness.</p>

  <p>'How is it that I have never met you since the fête of M. Watelet?' asked
  M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>'I have been much at home&mdash;and you have never been
  here&mdash;<i>voilà</i>!'</p>

  <p>'If you knew, mademoiselle,' he protested; 'how full my life has been of
  stupid things&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Julie interrupted him.</p>

  <p>'Do not blaspheme your gods who have given you all you want, M. le
  Comte.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, you imagine that I am a creature of the <i>salons</i>?' he asked,
  slightly piqued.</p>

  <p>She laughed at his ingenuous vanity. 'I imagine that you enjoy your life,
  monsieur,' she said. '<i>Mon Dieu</i> I have you not reason to?' Her
  frankness moved him to respond.</p>

  <p>He looked at her with that simplicity that was such a charming
  counter-balance to his brilliancy and made him, despite his gifts, so
  entirely an ordinary masculine creature.</p>

  <p>'I am twenty-nine,' he said seriously, 'and I have hardly begun to do what
  I want to do.'</p>

  <p>With her exquisite and acute sympathy, Julie instantly reflected his mood.
  She was sincerely grave as she replied,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'But you have! Every one talks of you&mdash;you do know what hopes you
  have aroused&mdash;and, monsieur, we are sure that you will justify them! Oh,
  <i>mon ami</i>, the world, is changing. Something different from all this is
  coming, something better&mdash;and you <i>young!</i> <i>Mon Dieu!</i>
  young&mdash;a man&mdash;brilliant, intelligent, powerful to influence,
  admired, you dare to be discontented.'...M. de Guibert flushed with the
  pleasure of her warm enthusiasm. 'You know better than I what the future is
  going to be&mdash;Madame du Barry will not always rule France nor people
  always laugh at the 'Encyclopaedia'&mdash;and you&mdash;you may well see
  these great changes!' she added, all in a breath.</p>

  <p>'I wish to <i>make</i> them,' he replied.</p>

  <p>'You will do that,' she said confidently. 'What is to hinder your
  destiny?'</p>

  <p>'I am poor,' smiled M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>'Oh, fi, fi!' cried Julie. 'But this is ridiculous!' To her it did, in
  truth, seem so; she was utterly indifferent to money herself and the things
  that she cared for had always seemed entirely independent of wealth; it was
  no factor one way or another in her world of philosophers and wits, and
  sentiment.</p>

  <p>'It matters,' he assured her, still smiling</p>

  <p>Julie gave him a keen look.</p>

  <p>'Of course, you are a great gentleman&mdash;like M. de Crillon who talks
  of marrying for money.' She spoke with a faint tinge of irony. His remark had
  reminded her that he belonged to that world that had always excluded her,
  save as a pet, or a fashion, and that adventures such as she and M.
  D'Alembert had known could never be for such as M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>'I also shall have to marry,' answered the young soldier lightly.</p>

  <p>'Are you then free?' asked Julie, with some little dryness.</p>

  <p>A shadow fell on his charming, expressive face.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>, are we any of us ever free?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'If I were such a man as you,' said Julie, leaning over the arm of the
  ottoman and looking up at him, 'I would be free as air!'</p>

  <p>The candles were behind him on the chimney-piece, so that he stood in
  shadow and the light fell full on her upturned face, pale beneath the powder,
  frail and splendidly lit by the soft dark eyes.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert could not quite understand her. He had thought that he knew
  all there was to know about woman; but this was a type new to him, since she
  was neither the frivolous, artificial, exquisite lady of the Court, nor the
  witty, sentimental, learned lady of the <i>salons</i>&mdash;though, in
  appearance, she might have been either.</p>

  <p>It was the repressed passion, the hidden flame, the driving force, the
  fierce energy animating the delicate frame, that puzzled M. de Guibert. He
  was used to emotions diluted by philosophy, sentiments shaped by fashion,
  opinions and judgments dictated by the head rather than the heart. He was so
  interested in her that he did not answer.</p>

  <p>'Tell me,' she repeated, with something of a challenge, 'why you are not
  free?'</p>

  <p>'Did I admit that I was not?'</p>

  <p>'A hundred times&mdash;you are fretted, tired, galled! <i>Eh bien</i>, end
  it!'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert was somewhat startled at her frankness.</p>

  <p>'Break with Madame de Montsauge?' he asked, surprised into an
  indiscretion.</p>

  <p>Julie's eyes narrowed a little. 'So it <i>is</i> Madame de Montsauge! I do
  not know her, but I have always heard that she is very stupid and a little
  vulgar.'</p>

  <p>'She is a charming woman,' said M. de Guibert, with a slight flush.</p>

  <p>'She is a habit,' replied Julie, 'which is more important.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert turned away with a restless movement. He was a little
  doubtful if the dark eyes were mocking him, or no. He rested one arm on the
  chimney-piece and stared down at the gleaming fire-irons. Julie let her
  trained, acute glance rest on him. She noted the strength of his figure, the
  depth of chest, the powerful shoulders, the thick neck, the grace of the
  small, compact head, the flush of health in his clear, fair skin, the firm
  lines of his short, blunt profile. How different he was from M. de Mora! She
  hated him for this, and yet, this dissimilarity fascinated her. She noted
  every point in which he differed from the man who, for six years, had been
  the idol of her soul. His carriage was not so elegant, he was not so splendid
  in his clothes, he wore his uniform carelessly, he was slower and quieter in
  his speech and movements, his hands and feet were smaller, he was not nearly
  so dark&mdash;Ah, bah! She pulled herself up short. What did it matter to her
  that there was a difference between M. de Mora and M. de Guibert? She rose
  impetuously.</p>

  <p>'I am half-promised to Madame la Maréchale de Luxembourg.'</p>

  <p>'And I to half a dozen places,' he said, without looking up.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu!</i>' cried Julie, 'then why spend your time here?'</p>

  <p>He raised his head, and his gray eyes smiled at her as he answered. 'I
  wanted to speak to you, mademoiselle&mdash;who is the man you mentioned at
  "Le Moulin Joli"?'</p>

  <p>'You ask that?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Why?'</p>

  <p>'One must be interested to know who could entirely occupy such a heart and
  soul as yours, mademoiselle.'</p>

  <p>'It is my secret,' said Julie.</p>

  <p>'You have mine.'</p>

  <p>'Punchinello's secret. All Paris knows of&mdash;Madame de Montsauge.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Eh, bien</i>, mademoiselle&mdash;perhaps all Paris knows of&mdash;M.
  le Marquis de Mora.'</p>

  <p>Julie de Lespinasse laughed in a sad, yet proud, fashion.</p>

  <p>'All Paris is welcome to that knowledge, M. de Guibert.'</p>

  <p>'It was M. de Mora to whom you referred at M. Watelet's fête?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch08"
     id="ch08"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">'Why are you interested?' she added instantly. 'M. de Mora
  is to be my husband.' Her pride urged this answer, her fear made her add:
  'The thing is not said above a whisper yet. If you, M. le Comte, must be the
  first to raise your voice, I pray you do not let it reach the ears of M.
  D'Alembert.'</p>

  <p>'No breath on this matter shall pass my lips. I had not spoken now, but it
  seemed impossible it could displease you.'</p>

  <p>'I am not displeased. To-night I feel happy&mdash;he came to-day, and I
  was frightened.' She paused.</p>

  <p>'M. le Marquis is ill?' asked M. de Guibert gently.</p>

  <p>'Yes, but now I am not afraid.' She looked at him piteously, like one
  wishful to be reassured. 'But it is terrible&mdash;this separation, and his
  health, and his family&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'How can he leave you?' exclaimed M. de Guibert, with complete intolerance
  for the other man.</p>

  <p>Julie flamed at once in defence of her lover. 'He has the best of reasons
  for leaving me! His mother is dying&mdash;he himself perishes in this
  climate&mdash;and he goes to conclude the matter of our marriage&mdash;which
  will leave me a lifetime his debtor.'</p>

  <p>She caught her breath, pressed her hands together, and, as if she was
  answering some inward charge of disloyalty, turned into warm praise of M. de
  Mora. 'He is everything to me,' she said. 'The thought of him is like the sun
  in my days&mdash;eh, I am more fortunate than the evangelists, for I have had
  my paradise on earth&mdash;for six years! I have never found a fault in
  him&mdash;'</p>

  <p>She checked herself abruptly, conscious that her usual impulsiveness was
  betraying her into too great a freedom before a man who was in reality a
  stranger.</p>

  <p>'No one has ever found anything but virtues in M. de Mora,' said M. de
  Guibert gracefully.</p>

  <p>'I spoke too freely,' said Julie. 'But what I said, I meant.' She looked
  at him with her frank, eager eyes moist. 'If you know him, you will believe
  and understand,' she added. 'And now, monsieur, I have my supper with Madame
  la Maréchale.'</p>

  <p>He put this aside with the impetuous masterfulness that sat so easily and
  so agreeably on him. He was really quite indifferent to M. de Mora, but not
  at all to Julie de Lespinasse.</p>

  <p>'Do not let us return to formalities, mademoiselle,' he pleaded, with an
  earnest note in his beautiful voice. 'Will you not have me for your friend,
  and let me enjoy your confidence?'</p>

  <p>Julie looked at him with a confused emotion that was partly fascination,
  partly resentment. Why should she accord to him what she had refused to M.
  D'Alembert? Of all her friends only M. Suard and M. de Condorcet knew the
  truth of her relations with M. de Mora.</p>

  <p>'I do not know how it is that I have so soon opened my heart to you,' she
  said, smiling proudly. 'But it is no matter. Look well inside, and you will
  see nothing but M. de Mora.'</p>

  <p>'With that name, all is said,' replied M. de Guibert gravely. 'I
  felicitate you, mademoiselle, on your great happiness.'</p>

  <p>This instantly softened her towards him. Neither pride nor prudence could
  any longer check her natural liking for him, nor balance the fascination he
  held for her. His voice, his accent, his personality at once so masculine and
  so exquisite, his face and person both strong and charming, his expression,
  daring and ingenuous (as if he meant to sin, and knew he should be pardoned)
  pleased her fastidious taste entirely.</p>

  <p>'Ah, <i>mon Dieu</i>! you waste my time!' she cried, suddenly refusing to
  take him seriously.</p>

  <p>He smiled, and then laughed.</p>

  <p>'He is dangerous, thought Julie. 'But he is adorable. I think he is what
  M. Richardson had in mind when he painted <i>Lovelace</i>. It is you who want
  a confidante,' she said aloud. 'Take me to Madame de Luxembourg, and I will
  listen to your complaints on the way.'</p>

  <p>'My complaints?'</p>

  <p>'Of Madame de Montsauge,' said Julie, with smiling malice.</p>

  <p>'I will find a more entertaining topic, mademoiselle.'</p>

  <p>'Did I not say that Madame de Montsauge was dull?' Then suddenly her
  humour changed. 'Nay, I will not come with you, I will not speak with you!'
  she said impetuously. 'You are no friend of mine&mdash;I do not think you
  ever will be&mdash;you were made for success and happiness, and I am not in
  the way of either&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Mademoiselle&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Ah, <i>mon Dieu</i>! do I want your confidences? You and Madame de
  Montsauge! You think that you understand everything, and you do not know
  anything at all.'</p>

  <p>'About what, mademoiselle?'</p>

  <p>'About love, monsieur. Oh, I do not doubt that you are a great authority
  on tactics!'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert was considerably piqued. He was not used to any kind of
  criticism from women, and he had a sense that Julie read him too easily.</p>

  <p>'I doubt if you ever will know anything,' continued Mademoiselle de
  Lespinasse. 'To love, one must be able to suffer.'</p>

  <p>'You think me incapable of that?' asked M. de Guibert. He certainly could
  not recall any of his vagrant love-affairs that had caused him pain, nor any
  great disturbance of his emotions in any way.</p>

  <p>'If you suffer,' answered Julie, 'it will be for other matters&mdash;love
  to you is but an amusement.'</p>

  <p>'What else should it be?'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' cried Julie. 'Did I not tell you you knew nothing about it? <i>Mon
  Dieu!</i> what should it be, but the giving of one's whole life, in joy, in
  agony&mdash;to death, if need be, to that one object?'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert looked at her curiously. With every word she said, she
  interested him more.</p>

  <p>'That manner of love is not fashionable now,' he said.</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Julie de Lespinasse, 'and, therefore, you do not believe in
  it&mdash;but it exists, monsieur, even in the eighteenth century.'</p>

  <p>She spoke in the proud security of her knowledge of being the object of
  such a passion as she had depicted. Her whole being glowed at the thought of
  M. de Mora. Perversely, she resented the radiant presence of this too
  attractive man who was so different from her lover. Ringing the bell, she
  called Madame Saint-Martin, and asked for her cloak.</p>

  <p>'So you dismiss me?' smiled M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>'I set you free to follow your inclinations,' returned Julie.</p>

  <p>'My inclinations are sufficiently obvious, mademoiselle.'</p>

  <p>'And mine&mdash;I am going to Madame la Maréchale&mdash;and alone.'</p>

  <p>'And I shall stay and dine with M. D'Alembert.'</p>

  <p>'I return late,' said Julie.</p>

  <p>'And I stay late.'</p>

  <p>She laughed delicately in his face. She moved a little away from him, and
  the fragrance of her perfumed garments was wafted to him as he stood looking
  at her with smiling challenge. In her heart she admitted that he was wholly
  delightful.</p>

  <p>'Ah, why do you waste this on me, who am old and plain? Be content,
  monsieur. If I were young and pretty, I should surrender at
  discretion&mdash;blame not your arts, but my age, that I leave you.'</p>

  <p>'I blame your occupied heart,' he replied gaily.</p>

  <p>Madame Saint-Martin entered with the long white gloves, the chicken-skin
  fan, the white satin mantle lined with false marten fur; the satin was
  beautiful if the fur was imitation, and the garment fell in rich folds over
  Julie's rose-coloured hooped petticoats. She looked now as he had first seen
  her at the Watelet fête.</p>

  <p>'<i>Adieu</i>,' she held out her lovely hand. 'I commend M. D'Alembert to
  you.' She spoke with meaning, and kissed her hand with an air of
  submission.</p>

  <p>'And I commend to you a certain poor Colonel of Corsicans,
  mademoiselle.'</p>

  <p>She looked at him half-tenderly, half-mischievously. The lackey entered to
  announce that her carriage was ready. This was the hired fiacre that was all
  Julie could afford. Close behind the lackey came M. D'Alembert. He had
  hastened back from the Academy in case Julie was going out anywhere, for he
  wished, as he always wished, to accompany her. Lately, she had more
  frequently gone abroad alone, or with M. de Mora, and this troubled the
  gentle philosopher without rousing the slightest trace of jealousy in his
  trusting heart. His face clouded as he saw M. de Guibert, for he knew that
  this meant that he might have to stay at home, but this momentary annoyance
  was forgotten in his joy at the radiant appearance of Julie. She greeted him
  with the greatest kindness, thankful that he would not be able to accompany
  her. She was in the last mood to be able to endure his anxious and patient
  devotion. The society of M. de Guibert had rendered that of M. D'Alembert
  more than ever distasteful to her, and she wished to escape from both and
  think of no one but M. de Mora.</p>

  <p>When M. D'Alembert had seen her into her modest coach, he returned to
  make, with his native kindness, the best of the company of M. de Guibert, a
  young man whom he greatly admired, but with whom he had little in common
  beyond a certain intellectual sympathy and the love of the same science, as,
  on his side, the young author of <i>L'Essai Géneral de Tactique</i> could not
  but be interested in the greatest mathematician of his day.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert was seated negligently in a low <i>bergère</i> when M.
  D'Alembert returned, and the philosopher, looking at the youth and grace of
  his appearance, and remembering the abstract studies and deep thoughts that
  had made his book on an arid and difficult subject a masterpiece, he felt a
  strong respect towards this splendid young man, who in a situation when his
  time might so easily have been occupied by the pleasures ready to his hand,
  had devoted his talents to a work likely to be of incalculable service to his
  country. In the warmth of this impulsive feeling, he spoke of the book that
  all Paris was reading by stealth. M. de Guibert was entirely unmoved by this
  graceful and courteous praise. He was rather tired of his work, which he had
  written five years ago, and which he meant to excel. He had not relinquished
  his evening's engagements to talk mathematics with M. D'Alembert. He wanted
  to know more about Julie de Lespinasse. It was not difficult to lead the
  infatuated philosopher on to this subject, which was really that which filled
  his entire heart.</p>

  <p>'Is she not the most bewitching woman in Paris?' he asked. 'Imagine,
  monsieur&mdash;she has never been able even to offer supper, and her
  <i>salon</i> is now more sought after than that of Madame Geoffrin
  herself!'</p>

  <p>'A triumph,' observed M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>He sincerely felt that it was wonderful for Julie de Lespinasse to have
  created so much out of nothing, but he did not say so in so many words, for
  he remembered that the position of M. D'Alembert was painfully similar.</p>

  <p>'Mademoiselle de Lespinasse is certainly a great adornment to your ranks,
  monsieur,' he added gravely. Then to draw further information: 'Madame du
  Deffand spoke of her the other day.'</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert flushed at the name of the woman whose greatest friend and
  oracle he had been for so many years, but whom he now hated, as Julie's
  champion, as far as it was in him to hate any one.</p>

  <p>'Ah, she would speak maliciously, spitefully, wickedly!' he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>'Precisely,' returned M. de Guibert, who had never heard the name of Julie
  de Lespinasse on the lips of the old Marquise. 'There was some quarrel was
  there not, in which the world gave Mademoiselle de Lespinasse all the
  right?'</p>

  <p>'Ah, monsieur,' said M. D'Alembert fervently, 'if you knew that
  story!'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert inwardly smiled at the eager little man who could use no art
  to conceal his infatuation, but the young soldier's graceful courtesy allowed
  no hint of his amusement to escape him. With cunning gravity, he drew out the
  simple M. D'Alembert.</p>

  <p>'Tell it to me,' he said. 'I was soldiering when Mademoiselle de
  Lespinasse came to Paris.'</p>

  <p>'Madame du Deffand found her at Champrond,' replied M. D'Alembert slowly.
  'At that moment the Marquise was desperate&mdash;a woman old, alone, blind,
  cynical, with nothing but memories of her lost beauty and her dead
  dissipations to entertain her. She was bored even with M. le Président
  Henault, to whom she had been faithful so long&mdash;in brief, she had
  nothing to do but to wait for the devil, and she found him tediously long in
  coming. Mademoiselle de Lespinasse was enchanting, all fire and enthusiasm,
  and wit and charm&mdash;and unhappy. The Vichys made an unpaid servant of
  her; she was humiliated every instant of her life. I think that she would not
  have stopped at all if it had not been for the children: she always loved
  children,' he checked a sigh.</p>

  <p>'Who is she?' asked M. de Guibert quietly.</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert gave him a glance of serene dignity. 'A Demoiselle D'Albon,'
  he replied. 'Lespinasse is the name of one of their estates.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert knew that he would get no more than this, and was tactful
  enough not to question further.</p>

  <p>'She came to the Convent Saint-Joseph,' continued M. D'Alembert, 'and
  every one on whom she smiled became her friend. We were used to charming
  women, but we had never seen a creature like her.'</p>

  <p>He paused and looked keenly at the young man.</p>

  <p>'She led a terrible life; I am convinced that it ruined her health. She
  did the correspondence, the housekeeping, the errands, she sat up at night,
  she was roused from her sleep, taken from her meals at every caprice of that
  terrible old woman, who used her blindness as the Christians use their
  Bible&mdash;to cover all their iniquities.'</p>

  <p>'Madame du Deffand blights,' said M. de Guibert. 'I do not care to be with
  one of such a bitter and withering cleverness. When she was young, she may
  have been one of the devil's temptations. Now she is old, she is certainly
  one of his mistakes.'</p>

  <p>'Imagine, monsieur, the effect of such a woman on a girl, sensitive,
  proud, enthusiastic, with fire in her veins! Mademoiselle de Lespinasse was
  in torture, she had no liberty, no consideration, no respect; a watchful
  jealousy, a cruel suspicion dogged her every action.'</p>

  <p>'But she endured it?'</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert lifted his head a little.</p>

  <p>'Ah, monsieur, both Mademoiselle de Lespinasse and myself belong to the
  people who must endure. Yes, she endured, and with grace always&mdash;she was
  helped by a great vitality.'</p>

  <p>In this speech was the reserve and the pride of one who has had bitter
  experiences, and who speaks to one who has never had any. M. de Guibert, who
  knew the story of M. D'Alembert, was sensible of the meaning behind the
  philosopher's words.</p>

  <p>'Madame du Deffand was not worthy of such a treasure,' he said, with
  courteous interest.</p>

  <p>'No,' replied M. D'Alembert quietly. 'She used her&mdash;absorbed her very
  life&mdash;and then, when she found that mademoiselle was entertaining her
  friends while she was waiting for her to awaken, she drove her from her with
  violence and contumely.'</p>

  <p>'But every one gave the right to Mademoiselle de Lespinasse?'</p>

  <p>'Even M. de Henault,' returned the philosopher dryly.</p>

  <p>'I have never spoken to Madame du Deffand since.'</p>

  <p>'In thus robbing her of the chief ornament of her <i>salon</i>, monsieur,
  you made her loathe Mademoiselle de Lespinasse.'</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert slightly lifted his thin shoulders.</p>

  <p>'She was never fond of me&mdash;I amused her a little by playing the
  mimic.'</p>

  <p>'You, at least, have nothing to regret, monsieur,' said M. de Guibert,
  calmly and pleasantly.</p>

  <p>'No,' replied M. D'Alembert. He rose and snuffed one of the candles, the
  gaze of the young soldier followed his movements.</p>

  <p>'It is astonishing,' he remarked, 'that Mademoiselle de Lespinasse has
  never married.'</p>

  <p>A delicate flush overspread M. D'Alembert's lined, plain features. He
  blinked at the candle-flame.</p>

  <p>'Mademoiselle de Lespinasse,' he said, and his high voice was a little
  sharp, 'was selected both by Nature and circumstance for other things than
  ordinary love.'</p>

  <p><i>Mon Dieu</i>!' thought M. de Guibert, 'is it possible he knows so
  little of the woman he adores?'</p>

  <p>The young worldling looked with a certain pity at this elderly man who was
  so wrapt in his dreams that he did not guess either how he wore his own heart
  on his sleeve, nor that the object of his devotion was absorbed by an
  overwhelming passion for another.</p>

  <p>'Truly,' reflected M. de Guibert, with some irony, 'he is as stupid and
  ridiculous as if he were her husband, without enjoying any of the privileges
  of the rôle.'</p>

  <p>Aloud, he delicately changed the subject. He knew he had gone as far as he
  could in the matter of Julie without giving offence. With his habitual care,
  he talked of the usual topics of conversation, the influence of M. Turgot on
  politics, the last opera, the Academy, the last story of the <i>salons</i>,
  the last appearance of Mademoiselle Clairon, or Court, the news of M. de
  Choiseul at Chanteloup. He supped with Julie's friend, was charming,
  complaisant, and brilliant He left early and went to pass the evening with
  Madame de Montsauge; he would have liked to have waited Julie's return, but
  any <i>tête-à-tête</i> was soon insupportable to him, and he was glad to
  escape into the summer evening and to return to his usual society and
  atmosphere.</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert was not sorry to be alone. He settled himself on the red
  ottoman, and indulged in placid dreams of his enchantress.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">The <i>salon</i> of the rue Saint-Dominique had been full;
  it was late when the company departed, but one remained to talk with the
  mistress of the establishment. This was the exquisite Comtesse de Boufflers
  who, like most fashionable women, loved the night better than the day.</p>

  <p>'Let us talk, <i>ma chérie</i>,' she said. 'Come! we have had enough of
  the "Encyclopedia." What is the last scandal?'</p>

  <p>'You wish to moralise on it, madame?' smiled Julie. The pretty Comtesse
  was famous for her lofty sentiments and her elegant defences of virtue; that
  she did not practise what she preached gave an added piquancy to her wit and
  eloquence.</p>

  <p>'Nay, I am in no elevated mood to-night,' returned Madame de Boufflers.
  She waved her fan and laughed.</p>

  <p>The two ladies sat on stools by the window that was open on the August
  night. Julie was ill and tired, the excitement&mdash;the animation given her
  by the company, had left her, the presence of her friend was a restraint. She
  wanted to be alone&mdash;M. de Mora left Paris in a few days' time.</p>

  <p>Julie had never loved the entrancing Madame de Boufflers, but she was
  under considerable obligations to her. This lady, possessed of great
  influence, had been one of the first to champion her in her quarrel with
  Madame du Deffand, and to support her <i>salon</i>, leading there her
  numberless friends and admirers. She was a delicious creature, who, though
  well past middle-age, preserved much of the fresh and delicate beauty that
  had been so resplendent; her small features, large blue eyes, air of languor
  and grace, her extravagant dressing, her polished wit, her gracious charm and
  sentimental coquetry combined to make her a perfect type of the lovely,
  intellectual, and worldly woman produced by the society of her time. She was
  good-natured and sweet in her native disposition, but so artificial that her
  life seemed a continual pose. Her gestures and looks were all as if she sat
  in front of a mirror; her conversation as if she thought her biographer was
  present. She was more natural with Julie than with any one, but never
  sufficiently so to please the passionate frankness of Mademoiselle de
  Lespinasse, to whom all affectation was hateful, and who, in that, was out of
  tune with all the women of her acquaintance. And the perfume of coquetry that
  clung to the least action of Madame de Boufflers was displeasing to Julie,
  who, like so many women of potent charm themselves, could ill brook a rival;
  so far their hearts had not come in conflict, but Julie was always
  instinctively on her guard.</p>

  <p>'What are we to talk of?' she asked now, rather wearily.</p>

  <p>Madame de Boufflers laughed again. She was all animation and spirit,
  a-sparkle with diamonds and silver-shot white brocade, attired in the extreme
  of the fashion with great billowing hooped skirts that spread round the
  stool, her hair powdered over a cushion, a bouquet of exotic flowers at her
  breast, and cascades of fine lace at her elbows; in the soft candle-light,
  with her fair face delicately painted and becomingly patched, she did not
  look more than thirty.</p>

  <p>Julie was haggard and pallid beneath her powder. She coughed continuously,
  and her breathing was difficult; her robe and petticoat of Indian muslin,
  striped green and white, made in the English fashion without hoops, looked
  simple beside her friend's splendour, as Julie herself looked plain beside
  the other's still superb beauty.</p>

  <p>She herself was conscious of this. '<i>Mon Dieu</i>!' she thought, 'who
  would imagine that Madame de Boufflers was ten years older than I?'</p>

  <p>'There were too many people here to-night,' she said aloud. 'My head aches
  with all the talk, which I think will result in nothing else.'</p>

  <p>Madame de Boufflers was surprised. '<i>Mon Dieu</i>, but it has been
  delicious There is no such <i>salon</i> in Paris&mdash;no, not even that of
  Madame Geoffrin.'</p>

  <p>'It begins to weary me,' said Julie.</p>

  <p>'<i>Ma chérie</i>, what then do you want, if this does not divert you?
  Paris can offer nothing else.'</p>

  <p>Julie was silent. She could not tell this woman, to whom she had never
  opened her heart, of the love that obsessed her, of her cloudy hopes and
  vague terrors, and the restless melancholy to which they gave rise.</p>

  <p>'Ah, <i>mon Dieu</i>!' cried Madame de Boufflers, waving the great painted
  fan, 'would you become like Madame du Deffand&mdash;so bored that she is
  impatient of living, and can find nothing to divert her but the prospect of
  death?'</p>

  <p>'I? Have I not loved everything in life?' exclaimed Julie, startled.
  '<i>Grand Dieu!</i> I have always detested people who are bored&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'So I thought, <i>mon ami</i>&mdash;but wherefore this discontent?'</p>

  <p>Julie smiled rather bitterly.</p>

  <p>'Madame, this distaste is melancholy, not boredom; it is not that I find
  the world insupportable, but my own life empty.'</p>

  <p>'Empty' was not the word she meant to use, but it had come to her lips,
  and once it was spoken, she was astonished to find how true it was. Madame de
  Boufflers gave her delicate affected laugh.</p>

  <p>'An empty life is the most delicious thing in the world!' she declared,
  'for there is nothing more diverting than finding&mdash;something&mdash;to
  fill it.'</p>

  <p>Julie rose, and stood leaning against the crimson damask curtain that was
  drawn back against the frame of the open window. The frivolity of Madame de
  Boufflers vexed her; she was impatient of this shallow soul that had never
  known a real emotion; some bitterness tinged this vexation. Madame de
  Boufflers possessed and valued lightly many things that Julie would have
  dearly prized; and mingled with this feeling was something of the rancour
  felt by the woman too proud to give herself for less than marriage, towards
  the woman who has taken a lesser price and who has never been made to suffer
  for her easiness. The fair Comtesse, despite her delicate airs of virtue, her
  book of maxims and her lofty sentiments, almost openly belonged to the Prince
  de Conti. Julie de Lespinasse, proudly conscious of possessing that virtue
  usually believed to be the most necessary to a woman, always felt slightly
  cold towards those delicious ladies of her acquaintance who contrived to
  manage very well without it, and who caused her to wonder, sometimes
  ironically, if its value was not a little exaggerated. Madame de Boufflers,
  who really thought that Julie looked sad and ill, and who wanted to distract
  her, continued to chatter, with very little more sense, Julie said to
  herself, than that generally displayed by the paroquet now asleep in his
  ebony ring by the fireplace.</p>

  <p>'If you are dull, <i>mon ami</i>,' she said at length, 'I will bring M. de
  Guibert to see you. I declare it is the most enchanting creature in the
  world.'</p>

  <p>Julie turned at that name.</p>

  <p>'I have met him&mdash;why, several times. Last Tuesday he was here, and he
  should have come to-day&mdash;but he is pressed, I doubt not.'</p>

  <p>'Did you not find him adorable?' cried the Comtesse.</p>

  <p>'He is certainly very pleasing&mdash;I should think, a great man.'</p>

  <p>'Why, certainly? Can you doubt it? You have read his book?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'What wit! What daring! What sublime courage What learning!'</p>

  <p>'What a success!' added Julie, with faint irony.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>! He deserves it! I never met any one who charmed me
  so&mdash;the face and figure of Lovelace&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Julie started at this comparison, which was one that she had made
  herself.</p>

  <p>'Eh,' she said to turn off her movement, 'would you compare M. de Guibert
  to the first of scoundrels?'</p>

  <p>'Appearance, I said,' answered Madame de Boufflers. 'His soul is that of
  the great Condé, his pen that of Racine, his wit that of Lafontaine, his
  <i>amours</i>&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'&mdash;Those of any young man,' interrupted Julie.</p>

  <p>The Comtesse laughed.</p>

  <p>'Certainly Madame de Montsauge is odious. What vulgarity! What stupidity
  And he is tired of her.'</p>

  <p>'But has not the courage to leave her. Your hero, madame, is but mortal,
  after all.'</p>

  <p>'It is not proved,' laughed Madame de Boufflers.</p>

  <p>Both Jove and Mars made mistakes in their love affairs. M. de Guibert is
  in good company&mdash;many a great man's one error has been his choice of a
  mistress.'</p>

  <p>'And a foolish woman's one success her choice of a lover,' added
  Julie.</p>

  <p>Madame de Boufflers ignored the possibility that these words might have
  any reference to herself. She laughed sweetly, dropped her fan on her silken
  lap, and took from her pocket a little box of pale-blue shot taffeta covered
  with gold net that contained the chocolate lozenges known as diablotins, and
  began to eat daintily these perfumed bonbons.</p>

  <p>Julie moved from the window and flung herself in the red <i>bergère</i>;
  the hands of the clock were nearly at two; her head throbbed and her limbs
  ached; her thoughts were with M. de Mora at Bagnères. She pictured him
  wakeful, restless, in need of her, and she could hardly restrain her
  impatience.</p>

  <p>'I took tea to-day with Madame de Luxembourg; there was nothing talked of
  but M. de Guibert&mdash;all agreed that he is certainly tired of Madame de
  Montsauge; he talks of travelling, Prussia and Muscovy. <i>Mon Dieu</i>, what
  courage! I was told he has not a sou.' So ran on the amiable, artificial
  voice of the Comtesse.</p>

  <p>'Madame de Luxembourg said Madame du Deffand is as witty as ever. She
  entertains all the English in memory of Horace Walpole. I must go and see
  her, <i>mon Dieu</i> I but it is depressing&mdash;the Convent of
  Saint-Joseph. They say M. de Hénault is very ill&mdash;he must have outlived
  the formality of regrets&mdash;Madame du Deffand will miss him like a bad
  habit&mdash;<i>ciel!</i> but to be old! Have you heard the story of Madame de
  Talmont? She pretends that she has loved no one since the Pretender&mdash;she
  wears his portrait in a bracelet set with brilliants, and, as she is
  <i>devoté</i>, the reverse side there is a picture of Our Lord. The other day
  some one asked "What is the connection between these two?" And Madame de
  Rochefort said, "It must be this text: 'My Kingdom is not of this
  world."'</p>

  <p>Julie smiled faintly; her dark eyes looked past Madame de Boufflers out of
  the open window on to the dark violet night that seemed so cool, so remote,
  so mysterious, compared to the candle-lit room.</p>

  <p>The Comtesse continued her delicate speech which was almost mechanical;
  her whitened fingers, glittering with paste, searched in the blue silk box
  for the little <i>diablotins</i>.</p>

  <p>Julie took no heed of her talk till one of her light speeches flicked at
  M. de Beauvau, and then Mademoiselle de Lespinasse roused herself in defence
  of the man who, at her request, had endeavoured to obtain a seat in the
  'Academy' for her friend, M. Suard.</p>

  <p>'M. le Prince is a very distinguished man, the most amiable in the world,'
  she declared languidly, yet with sincerity.</p>

  <p>Madame de Boufflers laughed again and at last rose. The paroquet has gone
  to sleep and you are as sad as a volume of Clarisse,' she said. 'Since I
  cannot please you, <i>mon ami</i>, I will take my leave, lest, like M.
  Lekain, I outstay my welcome and live to see my audience doze.'</p>

  <p>Julie got to her feet. She felt giddy, and there was an extraordinary
  heaviness at her heart.</p>

  <p>'Madame,' she answered, smiling with an effort, 'you pay the penalty of
  visiting one who is ill and dull.'</p>

  <p>She held out her hands with a frank air of regret, and the exquisite
  Comtesse, with real affection, kissed her on the cheek. 'You have the fever,
  <i>mon ami</i>, your cheek is hot!'</p>

  <p>'A little fever is common to me at night,' replied Julie. 'It is nothing,
  madame!'</p>

  <p>'You suffer?'</p>

  <p>'Madame, I live!'</p>

  <p>'So do I,' replied Madame de Boufflers, gravely. 'But I do not suffer,
  except when I remember my age, and even that reflection becomes tolerable
  when I recall that I have nothing to regret&mdash;not having done.' She
  smiled kindly at Julie...'And it is impossible that you have not also your
  solaces, <i>ma chèrie</i>?'</p>

  <p>'Ah, yes,' returned Julie.</p>

  <p>She drew her hands away. Madame de Boufflers had beauty, position, a
  title. She was married, wealthy, secure in her powerful lover&mdash;how
  different to Julie, who was but like a brilliant will-o'-the-wisp gleaming in
  the obscurity of a mystery, coming no one knew from whence, going no one knew
  to where! She endeavoured to conceal this sense of being different from her
  friend by an assumed lightness.</p>

  <p>'I believe that I shall die a good Christian,' she said. 'At least, I am
  already one of the "poor in spirit."'</p>

  <p>'Make M. de Guibert your friend,' advised the Comtesse. 'He will amuse
  you&mdash;you will find him a new type. Help him to get rid of Madame de
  Montsauge, and you will do us all a signal service&mdash;the creature is
  detested!'</p>

  <p>'But not by M. de Guibert!' smiled Julie.</p>

  <p>'Who knows? His relations with her are as complicated as the doctrine of
  the Trinity. <i>Au revoir</i>&mdash;I have the Comte de Crillon to-morrow. I
  hold you promised&mdash;<i>au revoir</i>!'</p>

  <p>At last she was gone with her lackeys and her women, her sweetmeats and
  her laughter. Julie heard the light carriage rattle down the street, and fell
  back into the ottoman with a sigh of sheer fatigue. She put her thin hands to
  her aching, burning head, and sat staring at the floor. So M. de Guibert was
  going abroad, Paris would be the more dull. She had seen a good deal of him
  lately, and had found him wholly charming; his manner and his conversation
  had a fascination that dazzled her into forgetting the faults she was
  perfectly aware of; he was certainly a new type among the brilliant
  intellectuals who had always formed her world. At once more full blooded,
  more ordinary and more conspicuous by reason of his active youth, his
  numerous gallantries, his military career, at times she doubted if he was
  anything but a mediocre man who had cleverly caught the tone of his day; then
  again, she would find him as magnificently great as his warmest admirers
  declared him to be. Never before had she been so undecided in her judgment.
  Perhaps also&mdash;but this she would not admit to herself&mdash;never before
  had any one person, save always M. de Mora, so haunted her thoughts.</p>

  <p>'He is not my friend, I do not believe that he ever can be,' she reflected
  restlessly. 'We are absolutely different&mdash;I do not even know that I like
  him. What is there admirable about him? Yet, when I see him, I forget all
  this good sense and see nothing in him that does not attract me.'</p>

  <p>Madame Saint-Martin entered with a little silver goblet containing hot
  milk.</p>

  <p>'Mademoiselle should go to bed,' she said anxiously. 'It is nearly three
  o'clock.'</p>

  <p>Julie looked up with a faint smile. 'I was too tired to move,' she said.
  As she put out her hand for the milk, a cough shook her frail body, and the
  tears came to her eyes with the effort of the spasm. 'I must have opium if I
  am to sleep to-night,' she said, when she had got her breath again.</p>

  <p>The chamber-woman took the cover off the goblet and offered the drink
  again.</p>

  <p>'Ah, mademoiselle! If mademoiselle will drink this!'</p>

  <p>Julie obeyed. She was too tired to resist; her gaze went to the window.
  The sky was paling above the house-tops. The dim purple of night was slowly
  fading into the radiancy of the dawn.</p>

  <p>Julie finished her milk and rose. The room seemed strangely dreary, the
  crimson draperies dull, the furniture shabby; the red flames of the candles
  fluttered forlornly in the pure breeze of daybreak that sent a breath of
  freshness through the open window.</p>

  <p>'How little I have seen,' thought Julie. 'How little I know&mdash;a
  chateau, a convent&mdash;two rooms in Paris&mdash;always the sun above the
  house-tops; somewhere it is rising above the mountains and the sea.'</p>

  <p>She sighed and turned away into her bed-chamber; the candles were lit, the
  crimson curtains drawn&mdash;here the dawn had not penetrated. Julie
  dismissed Madame Saint-Martin, despite the good woman's protests, and herself
  took off her gown and shook down her hair. Despite her fatigue she resisted
  the desire to go to her bed; the sense of the brightening day outside
  strangely disturbed her. For a while she stood irresolute, a white figure in
  her muslin bed-gown and dimity jacket with the powder still in her fallen
  locks, then drew the curtains and opened the shutters and gazed up at the sky
  now crystal bright above the silent city.</p>

  <p>The terrible yearning that smote Julie, frightened her.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>!' she cried in her heart, 'what do I want? Why am I
  suffering so? Is it because I am losing M. de Mora, or because I am losing
  love? Is not that what I need above everything&mdash;love?'</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">THE day of farewell had arrived. Julie was in a state of
  such acute misery that she sincerely longed for death. For some time past the
  anxious D'Alembert had been alarmed by her physical sufferings, her cough was
  painful to hear. She slept very little, her eyes were so weakened that she
  could hardly see; she was worn out with perpetual headaches and attacks of
  pain. Julie treated coldly this agitation on the part of her devoted friend.
  She refused to see a doctor, resisted his efforts to console and divert her,
  and showed him an indifference and irritation that she had never before
  displayed during their long connection, and that almost reduced the little
  philosopher to despair. With touching and almost incredible blindness, he
  still was entirely ignorant of the real cause of Julie's agony. Aware that
  she was distressed by the approaching departure of M. de Mora, he still
  believed that her emotion was one of warm friendship, for it was for ever
  fixed in his heart that she was incapable of any feeling for any man other
  than that which she entertained for himself. His continuous presence, his
  disturbed countenance, his worried looks, the whole personality of the man,
  so exasperated Julie that she was more than once on the point of telling him
  the truth and so breaking with a violent hand the delicate chain that bound
  them together. Shame, pity, and custom restrained her; she knew that to the
  candid soul and single heart of M. D'Alembert, her conduct would appear
  deceitful and would lower her in his eyes, and she was aware that he would
  receive a wound from which he might never recover&mdash;the whole edifice of
  his life would be overturned; he had been a wonderful friend to her and she
  could not bring herself to hurt him; then, on her side, she was used to him,
  he was part of her existence, a break with him would alter everything. There
  would be comment, discussion, perhaps laughter when the story got abroad
  among their friends; and, tiresome as he was to her rasped nerves, she would
  miss him. He loved her, and Julie could never endure to turn away love.</p>

  <p>So he continued undeceived, she even helping to deliberately blindfold him
  by forced kindness now and then, and inventing excuses for her humours and
  moods. The state of her health covered much; it was truly deplorable, and the
  continuous doses of opium, while they gave her temporary relief and strength,
  were gradually ruining her constitution.</p>

  <p>M. de Mora came from Bagnères a day in early August; his mother was worse
  and there was no hope of delaying his departure any longer. Julie received
  him in a passion of despair.</p>

  <p>'I did not know that one could suffer so and live!' she cried.</p>

  <p>Her lover was startled by the violence of her grief.</p>

  <p>'But I shall return,' he said. '<i>Mon ami</i>, I shall return.'</p>

  <p>Julie was not to be comforted. Everything was against her; there was every
  reason combined to thwart her unfortunate love, and though her faith in him
  was absolute, she doubted his capacity to combat the terrible obstacles that
  beset him; the most gloomy forebodings darkened her soul and wrung from her a
  cry of agony.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>, my destiny is too cruel!'</p>

  <p>She lay flung along her ottoman, the red cushions piled under her and
  supporting her elbows; her face, distorted and wet with bitter tears, was
  half-hidden in her thin hands; her loose, plain gown of rose-coloured cambric
  and her petticoat of English embroidery were crumbled beneath her; her watch
  had fallen from her bodice and hung by the steel chain over the side of the
  couch; the two little hearts, one of gold, the other containing the hair of
  M. de Mora gleamed in a ray of sunshine.</p>

  <p>'You have every reason for going,' she added, desperately. 'But I have
  every reason for keeping you!'</p>

  <p>M. de Mora knew not what to say in face of a sorrow so passionate; he
  stood at the head of the ottoman and looked down, with a bewildered
  tenderness, on the woman whom he loved so entirely. His stay at Bagnères had
  had some good effect on his health; he was more than ever confident of a
  complete recovery and the slight return of his strength had caused his hope
  for the future to be so brilliant that he was the less distressed by the
  pains of the present.</p>

  <p>'I shall return,' he kept saying. 'Julie, if you weep so, I shall think
  that you doubt me!'</p>

  <p>'Doubt you! But sometimes I doubt Fate!' she replied.</p>

  <p>M. de Mora was forced to admit himself that the prospect was dark enough;
  he knew perhaps better than she did what would have to be faced before he
  could accomplish their marriage.</p>

  <p>'But I will do it,' he said aloud. 'I swear on my honour I will come back
  to you&mdash;my love!'</p>

  <p>With infinite tenderness he leant over and put his hand on her shoulder.
  Julie instantly sat up, snatched his hand, and pressed her hot lips to it
  with desperate devotion.</p>

  <p>'Ah, Julie!' added M. de Mora, 'what is distance to a love like ours? The
  leagues need not frighten those whose souls are as one!'</p>

  <p>'I know! I am so sure of you, I would be secure if you were the world
  away. It is not that.'</p>

  <p>'What then? Nothing else matters!'</p>

  <p>It was the old defiant cry of love, but Julie knew that a great many other
  things mattered, and mattered terribly.</p>

  <p>But she also endeavoured to be brave and, forcing back her tears, and
  caressing his hand, gave him the gallant assurance she had given him
  before.</p>

  <p>'Whatever this means to me now, I thank you for six years of radiant
  happiness!'</p>

  <p>'Julie! You speak as if everything was ended&mdash;it is hardly
  begun&mdash;wait but a little, <i>mon ami</i>, wait but a little.'</p>

  <p>In her heart she answered: 'I am not young. I cannot afford to
  wait&mdash;I want my happiness <i>now!</i>' But she stifled this desperate
  cry and endeavoured to respond to his humour.</p>

  <p>He came and took his seat beside her on the ottoman. He could not long
  stand without the most painful fatigue.</p>

  <p>Julie wiped her eyes with a morsel of cambric, and drooped her sick head
  against his shoulder, and instantly moved it, for in that position she could
  hear with terrible clearness his laboured breath, that seemed to catch and
  rattle in his chest. She stared into his face and saw in the hollow lines and
  pallid colour the unmistakable marks of illness&mdash;mortal illness.</p>

  <p>'Julie, Julie!' he said, quickly reading her terror in her eyes. 'I am
  mending&mdash;I am so much stronger.'</p>

  <p>She touched his cheek with an unsteady finger; his flesh was chill and
  moist; he embraced her, and the feebleness of his arms sent a shiver through
  her body.</p>

  <p>'If anything happens to you, I shall die,' she said, as if to comfort
  herself. 'I do not think it would be difficult to die&mdash;I am so lightly
  attached to the earth.'</p>

  <p>He kissed her brow. 'We are going to live, Julie. Why these forebodings?
  Have I not left you before?'</p>

  <p>'And have I not suffered?' she asked, with passion.</p>

  <p>'But you must think that this is to be the last time, that after this you
  will have a new life in which everything will be happy!'</p>

  <p>'I want no happiness but this&mdash;to be so&mdash;in your arms.'</p>

  <p>'We shall never be separated again,' he assured her, with a sweet
  tenderness. 'I shall return for ever.'</p>

  <p>But Julie's spirits were weighed by the gloomiest forebodings, a presage
  of utmost evil hung over her; sorrow poisoned her very blood; all the forces
  of her nature were employed in suffering. Nothing in the world existed for
  her but this man from whom she must part.</p>

  <p>M. de Mora, struggling bravely against that physical weakness which made
  these strong emotions so exhausting to him, summoned all his manhood to
  comfort the distracted woman who clung to him so desperately.</p>

  <p>'You have your friends, your diversions. I do not want you to
  pine&mdash;get well, Julie. Leave the opium and let the thought of the future
  be your medicine&mdash;let people know you are my promised wife.'</p>

  <p>Julie shook her head. 'I cannot let our love be the subject of the last
  jest of the <i>salons</i>&mdash;let it be secret until it must be known.'</p>

  <p>'At least, tell M. D'Alembert&mdash;he is my very good friend.'</p>

  <p>'Least of all can I tell D'Alembert.'</p>

  <p>M. de Mora was silent. Julie's relations with the philosopher was one of
  those feminine complications that few masculine minds could either understand
  or approve; it had amused M. de Guibert because the position of the great man
  seemed to him comic; it vexed M. de Mora because to him the thing was not
  ridiculous, but pathetic. He was, however, far too chivalrous and free from
  jealousy to interfere in Julie's friendships, or to publish their secret
  until she wished to do so.</p>

  <p>'M. Suard and M. de Condorcet know,' she said presently.</p>

  <p>'I hope soon that all the world will know, Julie.'</p>

  <p>His arms fell from her, and he rose restlessly, with the movement of a man
  who seeks air. Slowly he moved to the window and drew the curtains back.
  Before him was Julie's cylinder desk and the marble bird on the gilt
  pedestal.</p>

  <p>'I shall think of you sitting there,' he said, 'writing to Spain. Your
  letters will be as the breath of life to me.'</p>

  <p>A moving sincerity rang in his words. He spoke quietly and his manner was
  subdued, but no one could have doubted the depth and nobility of his love,
  his singleness of purpose lent a dignity, almost an aloofness, to his
  personality; with all the simplicity and force of his fine and ardent nature
  he adored Julie de Lespinasse. There had been other passions in his life and
  other interests, but for years they had been completely overshadowed and,
  lately, entirely forgotten. Nothing in the world was now anything to M. de
  Mora compared to Julie de Lespinasse. And she knew this.</p>

  <p>'Is there anything you wish me to do, or not to do?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Nothing.' He smiled tenderly.</p>

  <p>'You leave me so free?'</p>

  <p>'Are you not Julie? That is enough&mdash;I love you and anything you may
  do.'</p>

  <p>Every fibre of her being responded to this.</p>

  <p>'I would die for you,' she said, with absolute sincerity.</p>

  <p>He came over to the ottoman again. He was dressed with great care in blue
  velvet brocade, with much lace and paste, and despite the ravages of his
  disease, he was still a graceful and magnificent figure. His splendid eyes,
  that now appeared of an almost supernatural size and brilliancy, were full of
  the life and fire he had no longer the strength to express with speech or
  gesture. Julie, gazing up at him, felt her heart ready to break from her
  breast. With a heartrending little cry, she slipped on her knees beside him
  and caught hold of the skirts of his coat.</p>

  <p>'I have never told you how much I love you,' she stammered.
  'Never&mdash;never enough! You have been the sun and the stars, fire and
  water to me&mdash;I have not words&mdash;I have not strength&mdash;I have not
  power to tell you how I adore you!'</p>

  <p>He raised her up, he answered her with some incoherent words, and they
  clung together, both shaken almost to swooning. He put her back on the
  ottoman, and stared at the clock.</p>

  <p>They had only a few more minutes.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>!' he murmured. 'These Pyrenees begin to frighten me
  also!'</p>

  <p>His extreme agitation brought on a fit of coughing that rendered him
  breathless. Julie fetched water from the sideboard. Their chill hands touched
  over the glass, the water was spilled over their fingers. He drank and set
  the tumbler on the mantelpiece. They caught hold of each other again, and
  their glances met, full of misery.</p>

  <p>'Love me!' cried M. de Mora, in a sudden surge of uncontrollable anguish.
  'Remember that you are mine, and that I should come, even from the grave, to
  claim you!'</p>

  <p>'When I cease to draw breath shall I forget to love you,' she answered.
  'Ah, almost I wish I believed in God, that I might daily pray for you!'</p>

  <p>They kissed in tremulous agony. Their cold faces remained pressed together
  in a bitter passion; the drops of pain on his brow and the salt tears on her
  cheeks were mingled; their panting breaths fused in one sob of grief. Three
  times he put her from him, three times he came back to clasp her again in an
  excess of frantic sorrow.</p>

  <p>Now that the actual moment was upon him, his reason, his philosophy, his
  fair hopes were alike forgotten. He only knew that he was leaving the woman
  so inexpressibly dear to him that she filled his entire existence. In silence
  he kissed her, again and again, with such force that her lips smarted. At
  last he tore himself away, and stumbled towards the door. Julie gave a little
  moan. He came back to her once again, raised her face, and kissed it from
  brow to chin. She had not the strength to detain him, or even to speak the
  last farewells. She sank from his embrace, face downwards, on the crimson
  cushions. When she raised her feeble head, he had gone.</p>

  <p>Julie sprang to the window, the heavy Berlin was fast disappearing round
  the corner. She could only see the lackeys hanging on the straps behind. She
  reeled backwards into the room and caught hold of the leather chair in front
  of her desk.</p>

  <p>Her suffering was so intense that her whole body was chilled, as if she
  had been subjected to acute physical pain. Nowhere could she see any help or
  consolation. Her one impulse was to seek oblivion at any cost, and she
  thought with a dull relief of the opium in her room, but she had not the
  strength to go as far. Gone! Gone! It seemed incredible. Never had she
  conceived such misery as this; the very breath she drew was hateful to her,
  the whole world had become gray and vile; there was nothing left but to sit
  and wait for the Spanish post.</p>

  <p>Fiercely she rebelled against the fate that had taken away from her all
  that had made life worth while. She thought with fury of the women who were
  openly and for ever attached to their lovers, and she wondered bitterly why
  such a destiny could not have been hers. She believed that she had a greater
  capacity for love than any woman whom she knew, and her whole nature was
  maddened by this frustration of all her desires and instincts.</p>

  <p>And, more than this, she was shaken by an overwhelming tenderness towards
  M. de Mora, who was facing so gallantly, and for her sake, pain and
  loneliness and difficulty. With the sobs catching in her throat she took from
  the drawer of her desk the little miniatures of her lover. One, oval and
  enclosed in an olive wood case lined with tortoiseshell, had been painted
  during the young Spaniard's first visit to Paris, and showed him in the
  height of his fame, success, and beauty. The face in its vivid colouring and
  fine, aristocratic line, was that of an ardent boy eager for life and
  adventure; the hawk-like features were full of vitality and charm, the
  magnificent eyes shone with intelligence, the full lips were curved to a
  winning smile, a rose was fastened into the folds of his lace cravat, and his
  black hair, unpowdered, hung in rich waves about his brow.</p>

  <p>Julie covered this likeness with kisses; then, holding it in the palm of
  her hand, gazed at it long. A curious thought arose in her distracted mind:
  'Compared to this, the admired M. de Guibert is plain!'</p>

  <p>She picked up the other picture; though it had been painted in Madrid but
  shortly after the other, it seemed the representation of a man ten years
  older. The face was graver, the lines hollowed, the vivid colouring gone, the
  hair was powdered, and there was no rose. He was in mourning for his little
  son. Julie closed the gold case over this and returned it at once to the
  drawer; the other she left open before her awhile; with unsteady fingers she
  unlocked a little portfolio of black leather and took out of it the
  twenty-two letters M. de Mora had written to her from amid all the
  distractions of his ten days' stay with the Court of Fontainebleau. While she
  was looking at these, her lackey entered, and announced,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Monsieur le Comte de Guibert.'</p>

  <p>Julie instinctively put the portfolio over the miniature.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>, I can see no one,' she said, in a dazed fashion.</p>

  <p>But M. de Guibert was behind the valet, and came smiling into her
  presence.</p>

  <p>Julie rose with an extraordinary feeling of panic, and shuddering with the
  anguish that she was forced to thrust back. All her air of a great lady had
  gone. Piteously feeble and confused, she faced him.</p>

  <p>'Monsieur, I cannot receive you.'</p>

  <p>But M. de Guibert advanced towards her; the lackey had withdrawn.</p>

  <p>'Mademoiselle, did you not promise to make me your friend, and is it not
  when we are in distress that we need our friends?'</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">Julie was helpless, all her vibrant energy was extinguished,
  all her glow faded, her delicate and graceful body had a broken look; she
  could hardly keep the tears from her eyes or her hands from trembling; never
  before had she been so exposed in her weakness before any one save M.
  D'Alembert.</p>

  <p>'You have intruded upon me, monsieur,' she said faintly.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert seemed to have a great pity for her, but no regret at having
  forced himself in upon her grief; she interested him extremely, it was the
  first time that he had looked upon a woman passionately moved.</p>

  <p>The wan, exhausted, bitter sorrow of Julie showed him how slight or how
  false had been all the feminine tears he had ever witnessed, the
  sentimentalities that were the fashion and that had hitherto satisfied him,
  appeared trivial indeed beside this intense emotion.</p>

  <p>'M. de Mora has gone?' he asked gently.</p>

  <p>Julie did not answer for her voice failed in her swollen throat; she crept
  to the red ottoman and bowed her head in her hands, heedless now of the
  presence of M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>!' he murmured, 'is love like this possible in these days
  of philosophers?'</p>

  <p>Madame de Montsauge and her placid posings flashed into his mind&mdash;he
  had called that love.</p>

  <p>'Julie,' he said, 'Julie.'</p>

  <p>She looked up with a dull amazement at hearing her Christian name; so
  bowed and shrunk was she in her attitude of utter affliction, that to the man
  who watched her she gave the impression of being shrouded in a mourning
  veil.</p>

  <p>'He for whom you weep must be the happiest of men,' said M. de Guibert
  gravely. Julie stared at him, his personality began to force itself on her
  consciousness.</p>

  <p>'You of all women!' he added in gentle amazement.</p>

  <p>Julie flung up her head. 'Did you think "love" was not in the
  "Encyclopaedia"?' she asked hoarsely. Her eyes glowed in her ruined face that
  was blotted with tears and distorted with pain. 'Or is it because I am old
  and plain that you are astonished?' she added.</p>

  <p>'It is because I did not look to find the heart of Héloïse in the age of
  Voltaire,' he replied.</p>

  <p>She disdained to endeavour to disguise herself from him. With a sudden
  superb movement she rose&mdash;it was as if she cast the mourning veil off.
  'You understand nothing, nothing, any of you&mdash;I think; it is he and I
  only in all the world, and we are parted, and he is ill.'</p>

  <p>'But he will return.'</p>

  <p>'Though death stood across the way,' said Julie.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert had never heard such words as these save in the classic
  tragedies; sentiments that had sounded appropriate mouthed by actors, came to
  him with a strange shock across the little <i>salon</i> of the rue
  Saint-Dominique.</p>

  <p>The August sunshine had now left the chamber, that was enveloped in a
  golden haze; mists danced in the honey sweet air which came in laden with the
  drowsy perfumes of midsummer that somehow were abroad even in the city. The
  paroquet slept in his ebony ring; his emerald and sapphire head gleamed, the
  only spot of vivid colour in the quiet room.</p>

  <p>Julie stood erect by the ottoman, pressing her soaked handkerchief into a
  ball between her nervous hands; her gaze was on the patch of blue above the
  house-tops; the tears trickled from her overflowing eyes. M. de Guibert,
  whose griefs had always been very material affairs, was more moved than he
  had ever been in all his easy life. For once he completely forgot himself in
  watching this strange woman; his expression and pose were entirely
  unconscious as he gazed at Julie, and his robust charm, his healthy good
  looks, his vigorous grace, were the more apparent. He was thinking of M. de
  Mora; naturally he could see nothing in the young Spaniard to justify Julie's
  emotion; he slightly despised him for being ill, and regarded him with a
  half-envy, half-dislike; he remembered what Julie had said about her hopes of
  marriage and wondered exceedingly: the Fuentès was a nobler family than his
  own.</p>

  <p>'He must indeed love her as she loves him,' thought M. de Guibert, 'it is
  extraordinary.'</p>

  <p>'What will you do till M. de Mora returns?' he asked.</p>

  <p>Julie did not answer.</p>

  <p>'You must not grieve too much&mdash;for M. de Mora's sake,' he added. 'You
  look ill.'</p>

  <p>She turned her small head and faced him now; he had thought her plain, but
  now with the tears staining her piteous countenance, he thought her more than
  beautiful, for she made any fair woman who was in his memory appear
  commonplace.</p>

  <p>'Monsieur, you took me at a disadvantage,' she said. 'I should have been
  alone.'</p>

  <p>'Nay, you should be with your friends&mdash;will I not serve as well as M.
  D'Alembert?'</p>

  <p>'I wonder why you trouble about me?' answered Julie uneasily.</p>

  <p>'I want to be your friend.'</p>

  <p>'And I have told you that my life is full.'</p>

  <p>'So is mine&mdash;yet it is all at the service of Julie de
  Lespinasse.'</p>

  <p>'Compliments of gallantry&mdash;to me.' she said in a voice too sad for
  scorn. 'Ah, monsieur, this is a poor opiate&mdash;I will take my opium.'</p>

  <p>'It is a pity,' he answered, 'that you should find a drug your best
  solace.'</p>

  <p>'May such an experience, monsieur, never come to you. I do not think that
  it is likely to.'</p>

  <p>Something of her usual sincerity, enthusiasm, and energy began to shine
  through the misery that had quenched her glow. 'You are not likely to,' she
  added. 'I do not think you have the gift of suffering.'</p>

  <p>'No? Perhaps I have the gift of healing.'</p>

  <p>Again a look of bewilderment crossed her face; astonishment made her
  tolerate him when no other emotion could have done so. She was a woman who
  had been seldom amazed for she had always been able to read her little world,
  and had never moved beyond it; but here was something new; even in the apathy
  following her violent grief this arrested her, and she looked at M. de
  Guibert with frank curiosity.</p>

  <p>'Is it possible that you are really interested in me?' she asked.</p>

  <p>A sense of what was happening returned to her. She dabbed at her eyes and
  looked at the clock; the most admired man in Paris had spent over an hour in
  her distraught company. Julie was trained in the school where to show genuine
  feelings was unforgivable and boredom the first of the deadly sins. She was
  entirely confused by the presence of M. de Guibert; never for a second had
  she thought that she could ever attract a man like this; even now she could
  not believe that she did attract him. She stared at him with heavy eyes full
  of frank amazement.</p>

  <p>'It is not possible that monsieur finds me amusing?' she asked with
  quivering lips. Her head ached terribly and her sight was dim; everything
  about her was indistinct as if the sun had suddenly faded in a clear sky. A
  fit of coughing broke her health, as with a piteous gesture she groped for
  the support of some article of furniture. M. de Guibert did, quite naturally,
  an impulsive thing. He stepped to her side and put his arm round her; for a
  second she lay on the laces on his heart, then he placed her very tenderly on
  the ottoman. Stooping, he kissed her hand, turning the little palm
  upwards.</p>

  <p>'<i>Au revoir</i>, Julie,' he said, and quite abruptly left her.</p>

  <p>The unhappy woman remained where he had left her, motionless, as if
  lifeless, a look of astonished horror on her drawn face. He had touched her,
  he had kissed her hand as if it had been her mouth. And this had given her
  such a sense of security, of strength, of serenity, that it had been an
  instant's ease to all her pain. A sense of strength! How different even his
  light clasp was to the feeble embrace of M. de Mora; how cool his lips were
  to one used to dry, fevered kisses, how radiant with health had been the fair
  face that for an instant had been brought so near her own...</p>

  <p>She shivered that she had made these comparisons which seemed to her
  wicked and disloyal in the extreme, but they had come none the less
  poignantly for being unbidden, and had stabbed her heart.</p>

  <p>'I do not like M. de Guibert; he shall never be my friend,' she muttered.
  With difficult steps she returned to her desk, sank into the leather chair,
  locked up the love-letters in the portfolio, and clasped the miniature to her
  lips with desperate kisses.</p>

  <p>It was twilight now; soon M. D'Alembert would be returning, people
  arriving; she could see none of them, not even M. Condorcet or M. Suard. She
  rang the red bell-pull that hung between the windows. Madame Saint-Martin
  came from the bedroom: she carried a pair of blonde lace sleeves that she had
  been mending.</p>

  <p>'I will take two grains of opium,' said Julie with ghastly calm.</p>

  <p>'Oh, mademoiselle!'</p>

  <p>'At once,' added Julie; she coughed and groaned in sheer pain and
  weakness.</p>

  <p>'Will you not see the doctor up the street, mademoiselle?'</p>

  <p>'M. Lorry himself could not cure me,' replied Julie. 'My good creature,
  fetch me the opium, quick.'</p>

  <p>Madame Saint-Martin, shrewder than M. D'Alembert, knew the cause of her
  mistress's suffering, even though she was not her confidante. She glanced at
  the miniature, at Julie's half-fainting figure, at her pallid face,
  hesitated, then went and fetched the opium. When Julie had drunk it she
  allowed the chamber-woman to help her to her room. 'If any one comes, say I
  am ill&mdash;M. D'Alembert will see them.'</p>

  <p>Madame Saint-Martin could not get her unlaced, nor the powder out of her
  hair, before she had sunk into a swooning sleep and had to be laid, all
  dishevelled, on her crimson bed. Madame Saint-Martin drew the curtains over
  the alcove and lit the candles in the bedchamber. Then, on a second thought,
  she tiptoed back, took the miniature from Julie's slack hand and put it under
  her pillow. It was of M. D'Alembert that she was thinking as she did this.
  '<i>Tiens</i>, why should he know about it?' she said to herself; she had a
  hidden compassion for the little philosopher that was slightly at variance
  with her sincere loyalty towards her mistress.</p>

  <p>Numbers of Julie's usual circle began to call at her door. M. de Vaines,
  M. Marmontel, M. de Crillon, Madame de Marchais, whose lackey brought a huge
  basket of fruit, Madame de Boufflers, and M. Suard. M. D'Alembert, whose
  single-mindedness made his actions decisive, despite his timidity, dismissed
  them all. Julie was ill, she was sleeping; he would not have a footfall in
  the apartment. With tender smiles for M. D'Alembert, the visitors departed to
  other houses where wit and wisdom gathered.</p>

  <p>The two ladies exchanged glances on the narrow stairs. 'She takes too much
  opium. <i>Mon Dieu</i>, it is frightful!' whispered the gay and fantastic
  little Madame de Marchais.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon ami</i>,' returned the languishing Comtesse, 'she is in love with
  M. le Marquis de Mora, and he leaves France to-morrow.'</p>

  <p>Madame de Bouffiers lowered her voice still more as she replied: 'He'll
  never return. Any one can see that he is a dying man.'</p>

  <p>Their voices whispered away on the mean stairs; their coaches rattled away
  down the quiet street; the modest apartment, usually so brilliant, was silent
  and dark; only in the bed-chamber a few candles burned.</p>

  <p>Madame Saint-Martin sat silently, with folded hands, by the fireplace; the
  air was hot&mdash;not a breath of freshness came through the open
  windows.</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert tiptoed into the chamber; he carried the great basket of
  August fruit that Madame de Marchais had left for Julie. They were of
  magnificent quality and came from the King's gardens. Madame de Marchais was
  called Pomona and Flora by her friends because of her generosity with regard
  to the offerings she made to every one of the flowers and fruit supplied to
  her by M. D'Angiviller, director of His Majesty's gardens and palaces. The
  gorgeous pears, grapes, apples, and plums in their rich colour and untouched
  bloom arranged in the delicate white of the basket, and scattered with small
  exquisite white roses and sprays of jasmine, were a strange contrast, in the
  profusion of their perfumed beauty, to the shabby figure and plain, tired
  face of the man who carried them.</p>

  <p>'She sleeps still?' he asked the chamber-woman.</p>

  <p>Madame Saint-Martin rose and took the basket. 'Ah, monsieur, it is more
  like a swoon than a sleep.'</p>

  <p>'She has taken opium?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, monsieur.'</p>

  <p>'You should not have given it to her!' replied M. D'Alembert sharply. 'You
  should have prevented her taking any; you heard what the doctor
  said&mdash;that she was in no fit state for these doses.'</p>

  <p>'Alas, monsieur, what can I do? Monsieur knows that mademoiselle is her
  own mistress and will endure no restraint.' M. D'Alembert did know this only
  too well; he changed the subject; even in his distress he was too just to
  vent his irritation on the chamber-maid.</p>

  <p>'It is the departure of M. de Mora which has so upset mademoiselle,' he
  remarked. Madame Saint-Martin glanced at him quickly; his blindness was
  incredible to any woman and to most men. 'Ah, yes, mademoiselle was very
  attached to M. de Mora,' she agreed tactfully.</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert crossed the room softly and drew the curtain that concealed
  the alcove. A single candle burnt on the table by the bedside, the curtains
  were looped back partially. Julie's slight figure in the tumbled pink cambric
  and white embroidery, showed sunk into the coverlet, her face was shadowed by
  the drapery. M. D'Alembert, as delicate-footed as a woman in a sick chamber,
  approached the great bed. Julie lay as she had fallen; her right hand was
  open as Madame Saint-Martin had left it when she had robbed it of the
  miniature of M. de Mora. The hair that had been carelessly dressed with
  powder, not pomade, was scattered over the pillow under her graceful head.
  Her face was of a dreadful pallor, her features sharp, her lips dry, her eyes
  half-closed&mdash;a gleam of staring pupil showing beneath the drooped
  lids.</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert recoiled; never had he seen her look so ill. He said so in
  an agitated whisper to Madame Saint-Martin, who was standing behind him with
  the basket of fruit.</p>

  <p>'Ah, monsieur has not seen her asleep,' replied the chamber-woman sadly.
  'In the morning she looks terrible&mdash;always.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>! something must be done!' muttered M. D'Alembert. 'I will
  get M. Lorry to see her&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'It is no use, monsieur, she will see no doctor.'</p>

  <p>'But this is not right,' protested M. D'Alembert in deep distress. 'She
  must drug herself before she can rest, and then she sleeps&mdash;like
  this!'</p>

  <p>In truth, Julie looked ill in her unnatural slumber; the animation of her
  voice and gesture and expression had always disguised from M. D'Alembert the
  real frailty of her appearance, and now, for the first time, a horrible doubt
  as to the nature of this illness which she had always made 'so light of
  assailed him, and he asked himself, in boundless terror, if her malady might
  not be the same as that which had struck down M. de Mora.</p>

  <p>The thought was too terrible to be long entertained&mdash;the usual
  hopefulness of human nature where its dearest loves are concerned quickly
  came to console M. D'Alembert.</p>

  <p>He approached the bed and gazed with infinite tenderness at the shadowed
  face; the look on his own countenance was such that Madame Saint-Martin,
  thinking of the miniature under the pillow, did not care to see it, and
  turned her head away rather sharply.</p>

  <p>The philosopher, the infidel, the leader of the new school of logic and
  reason, forgot all his tenets as he hung over the couch of the woman whom he
  loved, and touched her damp brow with a delicate gesture that was like a
  benediction.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">The autumn brought no good news from Spain. M. de Mora had
  only achieved the painful journey to Madrid to fall into so severe a relapse
  of his disease that he had to remain in his room; he was attacked by frequent
  hemorrhages, which, together with bloodletting, so fashionable among the
  Spanish physicians, left him utterly prostrate. His sufferings were rendered
  more acute by the absolute refusal of his family to listen to the proposal of
  his marriage with Julie de Lespinasse.</p>

  <p>His dying mother rallied her last strength to combat his passion, the
  Comte de Fuentès had every motive to support his wife, and the Duchesse de
  Villa Hermosa used all her influence against her unhappy brother. M. de Mora
  did not lose courage; his love was of that exalted nature which made it
  utterly impervious to all attacks; he had no interest in life beyond Julie de
  Lespinasse, no object in his existence beyond that of rejoining her. All the
  cruel opposition that he had to struggle against irritated and saddened him,
  but did not, in the very least, shake his purpose; his letters were
  passionate and hopeful, showing always confidence in himself, confidence in
  her, trust in their final destiny. Harassed by family quarrels, shaken by
  violent scenes, fighting a mortal malady, the unfortunate young man never
  ceased to write to Julie letters in which he opened a soul full of a pure
  tenderness, an unblemished fidelity and an elevated love.</p>

  <p>These letters were at once the comfort and despair of Julie during the
  long days of waiting; when they began to come less frequently, and then
  suddenly ceased, she was reduced to desperation, and employed M. D'Alembert
  to write to the Duc de Villa Hermosa for news of his brother-in-law.</p>

  <p>Julie's secret suspicions were well-founded; the family of M. de Mora had
  taken advantage of the fact that he was confined to his room to intercept the
  correspondence with Paris; the delays, losses, silences were not the fault of
  the post, but, as Julie surmised, due to the misplaced devotion of M. de
  Móra's sister acting under the direction of the dying Comtesse de
  Fuentès.</p>

  <p>M. de Villa Hermosa, who had enjoyed the friendship of the rue
  Saint-Dominique, and who was ignorant of his wife's intrigues, replied in a
  tone of frank and warm courtesy, giving full details of the health of the
  young Marquis, and through his hands a safe conveyance was assured for the
  correspondence between the two lovers. So again Julie did not scruple to use
  the devoted and deceived M. D'Alembert; he was happy in both his devotion and
  his deception; she saw him content with the kindness with which she repaid
  his services, and she looked no further into the matter than this. M.
  D'Alembert had ceased to mean much to her one way or another; she had found a
  soporific for the absence of her lover more powerful than the society of M.
  D'Alembert, and more dangerous than her grains of opium.</p>

  <p>This was her friendship with M. de Guibert. Despite his work, his social
  engagements, his ambitions and his studies, which made him the most occupied
  man in Paris, he found occasion to see much of Julie de Lespinasse. They were
  frequently together at the house of a mutual friend, M. de Crillon or M. de
  Vaines. They met in the <i>salon</i> of Madame Geoffrin or Madame Necker, at
  the suppers of M. Watelet or M. D'Holbach.</p>

  <p>Several times he had come to the rue Saint-Dominique when Julie was alone,
  and they had become completely in each other's confidence. She extolled the
  virtues of M. de Mora, which he endured with patience, and he lamented the
  faults of Madame de Montsauge, which Julie did not find an insupportable
  theme; he condoled with her on the absence of the perfect being whom she
  adored, and she sympathised with him on the presence of the imperfect
  creature who adored him. M. de Guibert&mdash;tired of Madame de Montsauge,
  whom his vanity felt to be an inadequate conquest for one of his present
  fame&mdash;contemplated breaking with her, and was pleased to excuse his
  action under the plea of intellectual inequality. In the company of Julie he
  tasted the exquisite satisfaction of the admiration and comprehension of a
  brilliant woman, whose capacity was equal to his own, and in comparison,
  Madame de Montsauge appeared more than ever stale and commonplace.</p>

  <p>Julie was absolutely sincere when she advised him to break with Madame de
  Montsauge; to her lofty and romantic ideas the intrigue appeared dull and
  stupid; she thought M. de Guibert worthy of a <i>grande passion</i>; such
  were beginning to become the fashion, the era of gentle friendships and
  sentimental, intellectual unions was ending; in the commencing reaction from
  too long an artificiality women were catching the contagion of passionate and
  burning love from the languorous and ardent pages of Rousseau and Richardson.
  Julie had been one of the first and the most eager of their disciples, as her
  breathless attachment to M. de Mora had testified, and she wished to convert
  M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>Both priestess and martyr of love herself, she could conceive of no joy
  outside his temple&mdash;the paltry sentiments which blasphemed his name to
  her were contemptible. And it seemed to her inconceivable that a man like M.
  de Guibert should be insensible to the wonder of the most marvellous of human
  emotions. She suspected in him an inner hardness, a latent insensibility that
  revolted her impulsive, glowing nature.</p>

  <p>'You will never be a great lover,' she told him. 'You have the flame of
  passion&mdash;not the heat.'</p>

  <p>His personality dazzled her; she was vexed that in his presence she had no
  power of criticism, no power of analysis; the perfume of his radiant youth,
  his healthy vitality, his secure serenity, attracted and fascinated her to
  the point that she forgot all his faults. The active life he had led, his
  restless ambition, his love of company and applause, his unemotional thirst
  for new experiences, made him different from all the friends of Julie.</p>

  <p>In her heart she suspected him of being more commonplace, and though she
  joined with every one else in hailing him as 'a great man,' 'a genius,' her
  acute perception sometimes detected in him the mere ordinary
  male&mdash;ingenuous, simple, self-confident, selfish, animated by
  commonplace lusts and desires, whose reputation was due to a superficial
  cleverness, great personal attractiveness, and a faculty for expressing the
  thoughts common to his time in language both agreeable and easy to
  understand.</p>

  <p>She told herself again and again that he was not comparable to M. de Mora,
  who was in every way the hero of romance that M. de Guibert was not Often she
  contrasted the two men in her mind, always to the advantage of her lover.
  Against the robust make of M. de Guibert, she set the graceful elegance of
  the young Spaniard; against the serene fair face of the one, the beautiful,
  expressive, dark countenance of the other; this calm, self-centred, strong,
  healthy, material character with that other, impulsive, sentimental,
  emotional, and passionate. She discovered nothing in M. de Guibert that need
  make her fearful of faltering in her allegiance to a man so in every way his
  superior, and she felt secure in indulging in this friendship that she found
  so curiously consolatory. Sometimes she regretted that the young colonel of
  Corsicans had ever crossed her path; sometimes she believed that she had
  found the perfect friend. Certainly her long, intimate, and loving connection
  with men like Condorcet, Gérard, Chastellux, Turgot, and Marmontel had never
  meant as much to her as did this acquaintance with a man to whom they were
  superior in everything save the allure of youth and the seduction of personal
  charm. This attraction that he possessed for her sometimes moved her to an
  anger that found vent in passionate words.</p>

  <p>'You would content a mediocre soul and torture a fine one,' she told him.
  '<i>Mon Dieu</i>! I should be sorry for a sensitive woman who loved you!'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert smiled at her vehemence which he never quite understood. His
  success with women was certainly not due to his clever handling of them, for
  he often showed an obtuseness and an awkwardness, a want of tact and
  perception, that maddened Julie.</p>

  <p>'You are insupportable,' she declared. 'To enjoy your acquaintance one
  must show one's preference for you&mdash;do you know there is nothing a woman
  dislikes more? You force one to admire you, and then you force one to show
  it. You treat all women as if they were fools and worthless, and yet you make
  yourself necessary to them&mdash;nothing could be in worse taste!'</p>

  <p>These complaints came from a woman who, used to being admired, flattered,
  sought after, found herself, for the first time in her life, obliged to take,
  not give, the favours of a friendship. For M. de Guibert was occupied, sought
  after, easily distracted, and (Julie suspected), easily pleased.</p>

  <p>He did not always keep his appointments, he did not always stay long when
  he came, he did not always come when she asked him, nor always follow her
  mood; he praised other women in her presence and showed interest in a
  thousand things that were of no interest to Julie. All this was new to one of
  the most admired women of her time; it threw into relief the exclusive
  devotion of M. de Mora. 'Movement is more necessary to you than action,' she
  remarked, with faint irony. She did not know what she wished him to do, but
  all his projects displeased her; she was vexed at his absorption&mdash;in
  what she called the <i>brouhaha</i> of society, she did not approve of his
  ardent wish to travel, nor of most of his friendships. She felt herself
  thoroughly unreasonable in this, and it added to the restlessness of her
  changing humours.</p>

  <p>Madame Geoffrin, Julie's most intimate woman-friend, noticed the uneasy
  sadness that clouded the spirit that had been so gay and enthusiastic; for
  the first time since they had known each other Julie did not take her into
  her confidence. 'My health is detestable,' was all she would say. She
  continued to frequent the brilliant <i>salon</i> of the rue Saint-Honoré,
  where for nearly ten years she had reigned as queen over that '.Europe in a
  triple circle about her chair' that graced the apartments of Madame
  Geoffrin.</p>

  <p>Julie had been as a daughter to this lady, and so had awakened the bitter
  jealousy of the Marquise's child, Madame de Fertè Imbault; it always seemed
  to be Julie's lot to be treated as an intruder and to awake some one's hot
  rage by any place she occupied. She had been the sole woman admitted to
  Madame Geoffrin's famous suppers, and from among the renowned people whom she
  had met there she had taken many of the ornaments of her own circle, the Duc
  de la Rochefoucault, the Abbé Arnaud, Lord Shelburne, Thomas, Duclos,
  Chamfort, Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, Creutz, La Harpe, Grimm, Suard,
  Condillac, Morellet, M. de Schomberg, Loménie de Brienne&mdash;all had adored
  Julie de Lespinasse in the realm of the rue Saint-Honoré. There, too, she had
  met several women who were her faithful friends&mdash;Madame de Meulan, the
  Duchesse de Châtillon, the Duchesse d'Anville, and Madame de
  Saint-Chamans.</p>

  <p>Julie's comparative financial ease was largely due to the generosity of
  Madame Geoffrin, as her social position owed its foundation to the prompt and
  warm protection offered to her by this powerful great lady who lavished on
  Julie all that care and tender interest that she might have expected from her
  own mother. It was to M. D'Alembert that Julie owed the introduction to the
  rue Saint-Honoré, and something to Madame Geoffrin's hate of. Madame du
  Deffand that she owed the former's first impulsive championship when she was
  cast from the Convent Saint-Joseph, but it was entirely due to her wit,
  charm, and vitality that she had so long and triumphantly held the position
  that she had gained.</p>

  <p>Madame Geoffrin rejoiced in her success more than she had ever done in her
  own, and now watched the cloud that was sinking over the spirits of Julie
  with an apprehension she had never felt when contemplating her own powers
  sapped by old age.</p>

  <p>One day in early spring, Julie found herself alone with the old Marquise;
  M. Thomas and M. Chamfort had just left; they were men whose work had always
  roused Julie's enthusiasm and whose company she had always delighted in;
  to-day she had received them indifferently, and seen them depart with
  something like relief. Madame Geoffrin watched her keenly.</p>

  <p>Julie sat on a low stool behind the rosewood table set with the Sèvres
  china wreathed with brilliant-coloured flowers. Her tea-cup rested on her
  lap; her head was tilted back into the cushions of the gray and silver
  brocade chair; she wore a robe and petticoat of gauze, striped pale yellow
  and white, a fichu of fine muslin, a black velvet ribbon worked with a
  bouquet of yellow silk roses round her slender throat. Her hair was powdered
  and gathered up under a mob cap of blonde lace, her face was pale beneath the
  white and red, her figure slack.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon amie</i>,' remarked Madame de Geoffrin, 'you are out of love with
  life.'</p>

  <p>Julie shook her head.</p>

  <p>'No,' she answered. 'I am only waiting for the Spanish post.'</p>

  <p>'But your news has been better&mdash;M. de Villa Hermosa has reassured us
  all as to M. de Mora's health.'</p>

  <p>Julie was still listless.</p>

  <p>'I lose my life in this waiting,' she replied. 'How do I know that they
  speak the truth? They hate me!'</p>

  <p>'M. le Duc was always your good friend, Julie,' said Madame Geoffrin, 'and
  besides, he did not write to you, but to M. D'Alembert; why should he deceive
  him?'</p>

  <p>'I know,' returned Julie wearily.</p>

  <p>The old Marquise was making knots; the ivory spool, the gold threads fell
  in and out of her strong, white fingers. Suddenly, she put this work away in
  the shot-crimson taffeta bag that she carried on her arm and gave her
  undivided attention to Julie.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon amie</i>,' she said tenderly, 'you need a younger friend than
  myself. Why do you rebuff Madame de Chatillon&mdash;she loves you?'</p>

  <p>'She is goodness itself,' answered Julie. 'But she wearies me&mdash;her
  head is as empty as a spent lantern&mdash;her soul is a desert, and I have no
  strength to fill either one or the other.'</p>

  <p>Madame Geoffrin sighed.</p>

  <p>'Madame de Boufflers?' she suggested.</p>

  <p>Julie sat up and replaced her cup on the table.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon amie</i>,' she replied with sudden animation, 'in you I have the
  perfect friend&mdash;why should I ask further?'</p>

  <p>Her dark and eloquent eyes looked with true affection at the old
  Marquise's stately figure in her black and violet brocade, with her clever,
  kindly face under the pillow of powdered hair.</p>

  <p>'But I do not make you happy?' said Madame Geoffrin.</p>

  <p>'Happy!' cried Julie. 'I have no right to be happy, madame!'</p>

  <p>She glanced round the rich <i>salon</i> with a peculiar expression; she
  could never quite forget that she was here, as everywhere else, by
  sufferance, that she lived on charity, that wherever she went, there was some
  one to consider her an interloper, an intruder. No amount of delicate
  kindness could efface from her mind the consciousness that she belonged
  nowhere, but was always indebted to some one else for a corner in their home;
  in her soul she still felt the brand of her birth. Would the Fuentès have
  refused to have received her if she had been really a Demoiselle D'Albon?</p>

  <p>'You were happy, <i>mon ange</i>,' said Madame Geoffrin gently, 'until you
  met M. de Mora.'</p>

  <p>'On the contrary,' returned Julie, 'I can say with Tasso, "I wasted all my
  life before I began to love"&mdash;'</p>

  <p>She rose and stood, a very slender figure, in the full lemon-coloured and
  white gown, resting her arms on the back of the silver-gray chair; she was
  all pale and faint as a pastel drawing, save for her dark eyes and the band
  of black round her throat.</p>

  <p>'Your reading is too sentimental. Leave Rousseau and Diderot, Sterne and
  your Richardson, and take up Bemis, Dorat, Crebillon&mdash;gaiety, <i>mon
  amie</i>, gaiety!' said Madame Geoffrin.</p>

  <p>Julie smiled. 'I can no longer be amused&mdash;I must be moved,
  frivolities cannot distract me. But why trouble about me? I suffer and I am
  ill.'</p>

  <p>'But this illness,' said the old Marquise shrewdly, 'is of the soul.'</p>

  <p>Julie shivered.</p>

  <p>'M. de Mora must come back,' she said vehemently. 'Those Spanish doctors
  kill him M. D'Alembert has asked M. Lorry to write to him telling him he
  should return to Paris.'</p>

  <p>'M. D'Alembert's friendship should soothe any pain, Julie.'</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle de Lespinasse laughed faintly in a melancholy fashion.</p>

  <p>'I fear I have done him harm,' she said sadly. 'If he loves me, certainly
  I have&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'If he loves you, Julie!'</p>

  <p>'I think it is but friendship. <i>Mon Dieu</i>, I wish he had stayed with
  Madame du Deffand&mdash;what have I given him but vexation?'</p>

  <p>Madame Geoffrin had never heard Julie express herself so openly on this
  matter. She was alarmed and endeavoured to change the subject.</p>

  <p>'Do you,' she asked in all innocence, 'find M. de Guibert as fascinating
  as he is supposed to be? I must admit to thinking him adorable.'</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">Julie had dined with M. de Vaines in company with the Comte
  de Crillon and Monsieur and Madame de Saint-Chamans; she had taken tea with
  Madame de Châtillon, and supped with Madame Necker. She returned home early,
  weary of all of them and hopeful of a Spanish letter, as it was the day the
  post was in; there was none. M. D'Alembert had not yet returned from the
  visit he was paying to Madame Geoffrin (he and Julie had begun to go out less
  together), and Julie felt a quick throb of loneliness. She dreaded the long
  weary night before her. This sensation of melancholy changed instantly she
  heard that M. de Guibert was waiting for her in the little crimson
  <i>salon</i>. Here was a distraction more powerful than opium to take her
  thoughts from the lack of news from Spain, more soothing than the opera, more
  pleasing than all the conversation of all her friends. She went straight into
  the little <i>salon</i> that never seemed dull or faded to her when M. de
  Guibert was there. A charming picture she made in the doorway as she paused,
  with an air of arrested movement, her short-sighted eyes narrowed on her
  visitor.</p>

  <p>Her hooded mantle of black satin, lined with ermine, was flung open on her
  petticoat of white satin and robe of white Chinese velvet. She wore long
  white gloves and carried a huge muff of the white velvet, on which was
  fastened a bouquet of little taffeta roses in shades of purple and pink, with
  gold and silver leaves. A similar cluster was pinned into the lace at her
  breast; she wore no jewels and her hair was pomaded and dressed on the top of
  her head.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert was quick to admire her frail grace, the delicate splendour
  of her attire; she was very much <i>grande dame</i>. He had just come from
  Madame de Montsauge and Julie gained by the inevitable comparison. She
  offered him her hand. He kissed the ring M. de Mora had given her. Julie
  shivered. Though it was April a fire burned on the hearth, for Julie was
  always cold save when in the sun; her rooms were usually warm enough for
  exotic flowers; to-night the lacquer jar had been newly-filled with
  <i>pot-pourri</i>. A glass jar of forced lilies sent by Madame de Marchais
  stood on the acacia table. Julie's garments were scented with
  jasmine&mdash;these various perfumes mingled in one voluptuous odour in the
  hot air.</p>

  <p>Julie took off her mantle and gloves and laid down her muff. M. de Guibert
  remained seated at his ease in one of the low <i>bergères</i> that showed his
  fine figure to advantage. As he was now bent more on literary than military
  triumphs, and sought to please the <i>salons</i> more than the army, he did
  not wear the blue and red uniform of the Colonel Commander of Corsicans, but
  a plain suit of pale red cloth, a light blue silk waistcoat, a muslin cravat
  and plain ruffles. She noticed these details at once&mdash;everything
  connected with this man was now becoming of intense interest to Julie.</p>

  <p>They talked of the questions of the moment, of Turgot, Condorcet, the
  question of America, of the three Academies that M. de Guibert longed to
  conquer more than he had ever longed to subdue Corsica. A charming intimacy
  surrounded them. M. de Guibert was flattered by the notice of this famous
  woman, and her personality greatly attracted him. Sensuous, but
  temperamentally cold, and though avid for experience, never yet having tasted
  a warmer emotion than ambition, he was intensely fascinated by this
  seductive, frank, impetuous and passionate mature. He envied M. de Mora such
  an incomparable mistress. The pale emotions of the women he had hitherto
  known seemed very tasteless compared to what he knew Julie to be capable of;
  he was not a man to care about a risk of burnt fingers, but he found the
  warmth of bright flames very pleasant.</p>

  <p>On her side, Julie regarded him with some secret anguish She studied his
  delightful face and saw neither passion nor sentiment there; she could
  imagine that his loves would be always brief and facile, and that though he
  might have the power to make a woman stake her all on him, it would always be
  that she lost. He would always do the obvious thing, thought Julie; his
  desires are commonplace, his ideals ordinary.</p>

  <p>She shivered again as she thought how terrible it would be to be at this
  man's mercy, to be dependent on his tenderness for happiness, to be jealous
  of the movements of one so restless and inconstant; to have to compete for
  the dominion of a heart that would probably never be undivided. How much more
  blessed was she in the love of M. de Mora than she ever could be in that of
  this man Yet his mere presence stifled her intellect, her judgment, her
  prudence, and even her thoughts of her lover, and she used every effort to
  please him, without conscious art, perhaps, for she was by nature entirely
  without affectation in everything, but with all the eager vitality of her
  ardent nature. She had always had the power to become interested in
  everything she wished to, and now she wished very much to be interested in
  this man, in the colonial regiment that he had founded and commanded, in his
  past life as a soldier, in his famous book, in his love affairs and his
  literary ambitions and dazzling future.</p>

  <p>She stood by the fire, her white skirts touched by a faint rosy glow that
  did not reach to her face, which had the ethereal and pearl-like pallor of
  ill-health. She was so graceful and well-made that her frailty did not
  displease, but gave her an air of almost superhuman delicacy very gratifying
  to the artificial taste of M. de Guibert. The light was very kind to her. The
  warm shadows disguised the defects in her features, and the lines spoiled by
  the smallpox, under the false bloom of powder and fine rouge, looked pure and
  exquisite; she had all the effect of beauty. Her fine eyes sparkled with more
  than their usual animation; the slight huskiness of her voice, and, now and
  then, a little cough, were the only signs that she suffered from any
  ill-health. M. de Guibert, studying her, again had that feeling of envy for
  M. de Mora; he did not speak his name, though Julie introduced that of Madame
  de Montsauge.</p>

  <p>'How long will you continue to submit to the companionship of one so
  inferior?' she asked, with light curiosity.</p>

  <p>'You think that I show weakness?' evaded M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Julie ironically. 'Perhaps it is Madame de Montsauge who
  shows strength.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert smiled. Tiresome as it might be to set himself free, he was
  not really afraid of, nor much troubled by, any woman.</p>

  <p>'I am not so bound as you imagine,' he replied. 'I must not be&mdash;I
  have to think of my marriage.'</p>

  <p>Julie felt as if her mounting spirits had suddenly lost their wings.</p>

  <p>'Is that arranged?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>, no! But it must be!'</p>

  <p>Julie glanced at his complacent good looks; so he was going to sell
  himself&mdash;just like any man, like M. de Crillon.</p>

  <p>'I hope,' she said, 'that you will have the good luck, and the good taste,
  to fall in love with your wife.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert returned her glance with a meaning look of radiancy in his
  gray eyes.</p>

  <p>The women whom one must marry are seldom the women whom one can love.'</p>

  <p>Anger coloured Julie's thin cheek; his admiration expressed in this manner
  roused all her sensitive pride.</p>

  <p>'There are men who do not think of marriage save when they can love,' she
  answered impulsively, thinking of M. de Mora. 'But,' she added, almost
  contemptuously, 'you know nothing of that&mdash;we were talking of ordinary
  matters.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert's amiable smile was not disturbed. It was seldom that women
  could ruffle him, for the real interests of his life did not lie with
  them.</p>

  <p>'I have some good news,' he remarked, 'which I have delayed in the
  telling.'</p>

  <p>Julie turned on an arrested breath.</p>

  <p>'I have got the permission of the Ministry to my projected travels,'
  continued M. de Guibert. 'And they will find the money. I hope to leave
  immediately for Prussia.'</p>

  <p>Julie moved away and seated herself on the red ottoman; it was as if a
  faint veil had been dropped over her face obscuring her bright look of
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>'I am sorry for Madame de Montsauge,' she said.</p>

  <p>'My absence will make no difference to my feelings&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Ah, <i>mon Dieu</i>!' cried Julie. 'When one is in love one does not go
  to Prussia!'</p>

  <p>She was thinking of herself, not of the other woman, and he knew it. Into
  his half-dosed eyes shot the look that had before reminded her of one of the
  scoundrels in her favourite fiction.</p>

  <p>'M. de Mora left you,' he remarked;</p>

  <p>At this name, Julie blazed. 'He had every motive for going&mdash;and above
  all, one that if he succeeds in achieving will leave me his debtor to
  eternity!'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert smiled. His look, his manner, his composure, the health and
  glow and charm of his person tormented Julie; at the bottom of all her
  distracted thoughts was this stinging reflection: 'It is easy for him to go
  and difficult for me to stay behind.' She felt intensely humiliated that she
  had put it in this man's power to cause her any pain; exasperated at the
  knowledge that she had no shadow of right to control, or even criticise his
  actions, and wounded that he should put anything before her proffered
  friendship.</p>

  <p>'You will write to me?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'I do not know how your absence will affect me,' she said, 'nor whether I
  shall have either the wish, the power, or the time to write.' She said this
  with the indifferent air of a great lady besought for favours, and felt that
  in some degree she had vindicated herself.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert, who did not greatly trouble what her feelings were, nor if
  he hurt her, and who only wanted an intelligent listener, began to speak of
  his proposed visit to Ferney and Potsdam, of the chance that his travels
  would extend as far as the Court of Catherine, and of the book he was to
  write when he returned.</p>

  <p>Julie listened wearily, leaning back in her cushions. She did not look at
  M. de Guibert, but stared at the two white busts that faced her; the
  flickering candler light gave to that of D'Alembert a reproachful look, she
  thought, and to that of Voltaire an ironical smile.</p>

  <p>She admitted herself a fit object for reproach and irony. Why should she,
  ennobled by the deathless love of a splendid man, set apart from other women
  by the sorrow and sacredness of her secret betrothal, be agitated by the loss
  of the society of this conventional darling of the <i>salons</i>, this man
  adored by commonplace women?</p>

  <p>She turned her head, and looked at him with the scornful intention of
  disabusing herself of any faith in him, any interest, and endeavoured to
  strengthen herself with the memory of her noble and loyal lover. But as she
  stared at him, she found herself noticing the details of his person; the
  strength and compact grace of his slightly thick-set figure, his short neck,
  his deep chest, the sheer animal health and serene good spirits expressed in
  his blunt, fresh features; his masterful gray eyes, radiant with youth and
  ardour, held the allure of ingenuous and imperious masculinity, a look not
  often seen in the men of Julie's world. As she gazed at him, and listened to
  that beautiful voice, that was one of his greatest charms, she realised, with
  a dreadful sinking of the heart, that he alone in all Paris was vivid and
  real to her, that he had been her one consolation, her one distraction since
  the departure of M. de Mora, and that, if he left her, she would be
  surrounded by a desert from which her soul shrank. It was a year since he had
  Come into her life, and already he was as necessary to her as the air she
  breathed; she knew this in the light of his impending absence, and she was
  terrified at herself.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>!' she cried impulsively, interrupting his eager
  discourse, 'why need you go?'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert paused, startled and fascinated by this note of passion. In
  his dealings with women he was more the soldier than the Parisian; he rose
  and said, almost bluntly,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Do you want me to stay?'</p>

  <p>Julie coloured at this directness; yet it thrilled her. She had to control
  herself not to respond with stormy impetuousness.</p>

  <p>'Friends are not so common,' she said.</p>

  <p>'Julie de Lespinasse has friends enough,' he replied.</p>

  <p>'Never enough, <i>mon Dieu!</i>' She spoke with an effort; a rare thing
  for her, and he knew it. He was watching her curiously.</p>

  <p>'You have distracted me,' she added. 'I dislike these foreign countries
  that take you away.' She also rose, moved by that inner restlessness that she
  could not combat. M. de Guibert snuffed the neglected candles that flared on
  the mantelpiece. As he performed this simple task he was wondering' what to
  do with Julie. She was not thinking at all, but marking his extremely fine
  hand raised against the flame and the strength of the wrist from which the
  pale muslin ruffle fell back.</p>

  <p>'I shall return,' he said, without looking round.</p>

  <p>Julie did not answer. A thought sudden and fierce as the touch of a
  flaming arrow-head, touched her: 'If he loved me but half as much as M. de
  Mora loves me, he would not go.' Then she cursed herself for this, and stood
  taut and horrified as one drawn up on the edge of a precipice.</p>

  <p>The little red <i>salon</i> seemed very silent, very remote, very
  far-removed from the world, as dreamlike to her heavy eyes as that day when
  her lover had said goodbye, and she had fallen in abject misery along the
  ottoman by which she was now standing. She could not disguise how powerfully
  she was moved.</p>

  <p>'I shall miss you,' she said.</p>

  <p>Never before had she so flattered any man. The husky notes of her troubled
  voice brought a tinge of colour into M. de Guibert's firm cheek. There was
  something conveyed by her personality that was like inner exultation and
  outward fear. This roused him; never had he found her charm so seductive. His
  heart beat a shade faster, and for the moment he forgot Ferney and Potsdam,
  his new book, the battlefields of the Seven Years' War.</p>

  <p>'I shall write to you,' he said, 'from every stage, by every post.'</p>

  <p>Julie put out her hand as if she warded off danger.</p>

  <p>'I implore you to deal frankly with me,' she said. 'I constrain you to
  nothing&mdash;write to me little, or much, or not at all.'</p>

  <p>She moved wearily towards the hearth on which the fire was dying. The
  faint, steady light of the falling embers cast a golden bloom over her white
  velvet, her white satin, her tired face.</p>

  <p>'I shall return,' repeated M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>A strange look flashed in the depths of her dark eyes.</p>

  <p>'I am used to waiting,' she answered.</p>

  <p>He was watching her very intently. In this environment that so exactly
  suited her and was so peculiarly her own, she was as exquisite as a pearl on
  a golden thread, and very alluring to the senses of the man who observed her
  because of this human stress and hunger, and flux and reflux of pride and
  emotion that glowed beneath her delicate refinement.</p>

  <p>We become dull,' she said suddenly. 'Do not wait for M.
  D'Alembert&mdash;he will be late. I wish to be alone&mdash;your adieux
  another time, monsieur.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert laughed away this dismissal. 'You are too much alone,' he
  answered.</p>

  <p>Before she could guess his intention he was beside her and had taken her
  in his arms as simply as if they were acknowledged lovers. His own blood
  leapt to hear her little cry, and to feel the shudder that shook her. The
  flame and swiftness, if not the heat and force of passion, was easily roused
  in him, and he kissed her as he had not meant to kiss her, with an eager
  strength that had all the glow of love.</p>

  <p>Julie had thought she knew all there was to know of passion. Now she
  realised that she had been used to the caresses of a sick man, and saw the
  long episode of her love affair as a drama that had lacked a climax&mdash;a
  flower that had never come to fruition.</p>

  <p>She loathed M. de Guibert for giving her this wisdom, for making what had
  seemed so perfect appear pale and colourless, and she drew herself away,
  flushed and trembling, but with dignity.</p>

  <p>'A moment more,' he said, much moved. 'Give me a moment more, <i>mon
  amie</i>.'</p>

  <p>Julie shivered back against the wall; she was frightened at herself for
  the first time in her life. Never had a man touched her in this fashion; the
  love-making of M. de Mora had always been romantic, ethereal, high-flown,
  sentimental, such as had suited her innate fastidiousness. All other men had
  treated her with entire deference; no one had kissed more than her
  hand&mdash;not even D'Alembert...</p>

  <p>'I am very tired,' she said proudly. She tried to collect herself. She
  still seemed to feel the warm fragrance of his cheek and lips and
  breath&mdash;the strength of his firm but delicate embrace. She would not
  look at him, but pulled the bell-rope behind her. She had difficulty in
  maintaining the stillness of her demeanour.</p>

  <p>'I being what I am,' she said, a is impossible that you mean to amuse
  yourself with me. You being what you are, it is impossible that I mean to
  amuse myself with you. That we can be friends is equally
  impossible&mdash;adieu!'</p>

  <p>'Why?' he asked, neither daunted nor vexed.</p>

  <p>Julie, with her usual proud frankness, gave him the truth. 'Because you
  are a type of man new to me, and one that I do not know how to manage.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert took this as a confession of defeat, but before he could
  follow up his advantage, Madame Saint-Martin entered. Julie held out her
  hands.</p>

  <p>'Ah, my good creature, I am tired&mdash;tired&mdash;tired! Adieu,
  monsieur.'</p>

  <p>She was gone swiftly, and the chamber-woman followed her. M. de Guibert
  picked up his hat and coat; his feeling for Julie could not, for an instant,
  deflect him from his resolve to leave Paris, but it made him look forward to
  his return. In the little anteroom he met M. D'Alembert entering with a
  letter in his hand.</p>

  <p>'The Spanish post,' smiled the little philosopher. 'I have been to fetch
  this letter&mdash;it was late to-day, and if I had not gone, Mademoiselle de
  Lespinasse would have had to wait until the morning&mdash;a letter from M. de
  Mora,' he beamed, and one from M. de Villa Hermosa.'</p>

  <p>'Mademoiselle de Lespinasse is anxious about the health of M. de Mora?'
  suggested M. de Guibert suavely.</p>

  <p>'But terribly!' exclaimed M. D'Alembert, eagerly. 'He is one of her
  dearest friends&mdash;but lately the news has been better. Forgive me,
  monsieur, if I hasten to give her this letter.'</p>

  <p>They parted. The young soldier laughed as he descended the dark, humble
  stairs. The behaviour of the great man seemed to him almost too astonishingly
  amusing to be true.</p>

  <p>'Truly,' he thought, 'since the philosophers introduced the age of Reason,
  there has been no more common sense in Paris.'</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">Julie had written her letter to Madrid; she had sat hours
  over it, and it was full of protestations of love and fidelity, but for the
  first time it was not a single-hearted letter, for M. de Mora no longer
  occupied the first place in Julie's tempestuous heart. She loathed herself,
  she fought with fury against the fate that was overwhelming her. Even in her
  own soul she denied passionately that she was faithless to her 'incomparable
  lover,' as she named him to herself, but she could no more resist the charm
  of M. de Guibert than she could resist the opium to which she continuously
  turned in her desperation. Since the day that he had informed her of his
  intended journey, she had seen him often; but never alone. She told herself
  fiercely that when he left Paris he would leave her life, and that this
  departure would be the most fortunate thing that could happen. But she knew
  that she would have given anything to have kept him near her; she knew that
  the thought of Madame de Montsauge tortured her, and that when she observed
  Madame de Boufflers paying court to the hero of the hour, and M. de Guibert
  by no means insensible to her coquetry, that her friendship for that lady
  melted like a snow-wreath before the sun, and she came perilously near to
  hating the seductive Comtesse. She tried to fortify herself with the logic of
  the school in which she had been so long trained. 'If I,' she told herself,
  'permitted myself to think too much of this man whom I neither know, nor
  really admire, while I am pledged to the noblest and most devoted of lovers,
  whose trust in me is perfect, I should be the basest of creatures, without a
  shadow of an excuse&mdash;not even that of youth. <i>Mon Dieu</i>! I am
  forty!'</p>

  <p>But Julie found that all the reason, all the philosophy in the
  Encyclopaedia were insufficient to calm one wild human heart. She endeavoured
  to absorb herself in her usual pursuits; she wrote to M. Condorcet, to M.
  Suard; she waited on Madame Geoffrin; she held her crowded brilliant
  <i>salons</i>; she went out to dinner, tea, supper; she showed her usual
  eager interest in the affairs of her world&mdash;the new book by M. Thomas,
  the reforms of M. Turgot. She exercised her usual keen judgment, her clear
  intelligence, but it was all on the surface. Her heart was entirely occupied
  with M. de Guibert. He found occasion to write to her, and she did not answer
  him; when he came to see her, she evaded him. She asked him to supper, but M.
  D'Alembert was always present; yet it was with a fierce pleasure that she
  noted that he was losing some of his calm, that he sought her out, that he
  was certainly seeing less of Madame de Montsauge.</p>

  <p>She thought that he was catching some of her agitation, that she had
  roused him, at least a little, and this gave her a new sensation of
  breathless, incredulous triumph. Hitherto, she had taken her dominion over
  men for granted&mdash;with M. de Guibert she had never been sure of her
  influence.</p>

  <p>Her health continued to suffer from the secret emotions that tore her
  soul. She was sleepless, shaken with a painful cough, prostrated by sickness
  and attacks of pain, consumed with fever almost every evening. Yet, with a
  flaming energy that was almost superhuman, she would not interrupt her daily
  life, nor see any doctor save the little local physician, who gave her
  medicines that she laughed at.</p>

  <p>'Nothing agrees with people like happiness,' she said ironically. 'Have
  you the prescription?'</p>

  <p>She refused to visit M. Lorry, or to give up the opium; she put M.
  D'Alembert to a torture as acute as her own with her refusal to take care of
  herself and the angry coldness, or glacial indifference, that covered her
  inward struggles; yet never did he suspect that she was unfaithful to their
  unsigned compact, or regardless of the love he had never spoken. Julie, when
  she gave him a thought at all, heartily desired his absence, and even tried
  to persuade him to pay a visit to Penney. But M. D'Alembert had tried this in
  the early days of her infatuation for M. de Mora, when her distraction had
  distressed him unbearably, and he had found life unendurable away from Julie
  de Lespinasse, and had cancelled his projected travels, to accomplish which
  he had received a grant from the King of Prussia, and returned instantly to
  the humble upper room in the rue Saint-Dominique, and knew that he could
  never bring himself to leave the woman whom he so blindly adored.</p>

  <p>Within a few days of the departure of M. de Guibert, Julie yielded to the
  persistent and imperative clamour of her heart, and sent the young colonel a
  note that brought him at once to her apartment. She had been dining with
  Madame de Châtillon, and had not taken off her mantle when M. de Guibert
  arrived. In this garment of pale-red satin edged with gray fur she was
  standing by the window, looking out on to the pale spring day.</p>

  <p>A fine rain was falling, and the air was chilly&mdash;houses and sky were
  gray alike; there was no sign of May here in the heart of the city. It was a
  year, almost to the very day, since Julie had first met M. de Guibert. She
  turned at his entry, looking haggard in the light that was lifeless yet
  penetrating; her lack of youth and of health was painfully apparent, but her
  vivid personality triumphed, and she glowed with life.</p>

  <p>'Why did I ask you to come?' she greeted him. 'I think that you were made
  to torment me.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert was radiant. Adventure, novelty, applause and fame were
  before him. He was going to do what he wanted to do, and be admired for it.
  He had his work to satisfy his ambition, adoring women to satisfy his
  emotions, and a crowd of flatterers to satisfy his vanity. His healthy
  manhood was content, his splendid egotism viewed the world as a wholly
  delightful place. He saw that there was much wrong, and he was sincerely
  anxious to serve in the cause of right; his outlook was noble, and his
  patriotism genuine, but no real pang was caused him by the sufferings or
  difficulties of humanity. In Julie he saw the means of a new and fascinating
  experience. The sentimental friendship of this passionate and famous woman
  flattered both his senses and his intelligence, and he saw no reason to forgo
  it. To Monsieur de Mora he gave no more thought than he did to Monsieur
  D'Alembert. It was easy for him to effect a charming friendship for the
  philosopher, while in his heart good-humouredly considering him a fool; and
  it was more than easy, it was instinctive, to dismiss from his mind a man
  three hundred leagues away who was probably dying.</p>

  <p>To the subtle tortures that Julie was enduring he gave no consideration.
  Her suppressed fury of feeling, which he could not yet quite put a name to,
  roused and slightly agitated him. His heart had begun to be stirred with the
  uneasy vibrations roused by the proximity of an appealing passion. He did not
  speak to her now, but stood looking at her in her crimson <i>salon</i>; he
  had often of late visited this little room in his thoughts.</p>

  <p>'You go on Tuesday?' asked Julie; her eyes were bright and there was some
  colour in her cheeks, for his sheer presence made her spirits rise.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' he replied. 'But I do not think of my departure, but of my
  return.'</p>

  <p>'If that were true, you would not go!' she said instantly.</p>

  <p>'I must,' he answered. He was no adept in gallant speeches, and did not
  know how to flatter one so direct.</p>

  <p>Julie moved from the window and flung off her mantle impatiently. The gown
  revealed, of wide poppy red and white satin stripes, was the brightest thing
  in the room.</p>

  <p>'Ah, go she cried. 'Your talents condemn you to celebrity, you must endure
  greatness! You have no room in your life for gentle affections and soft
  emotions.'</p>

  <p>'You say that? <i>Mon ami</i>, I have come to offer you my most tender
  friendship&mdash;my most faithful devotion.'</p>

  <p>'I do not want it!' returned Julie angrily...'Ah, you are an excellent and
  amiable creature! The letter you sent me had the sweetness of Gessner, am'
  the energy of Jean Jacques&mdash;you have all that can please and
  touch&mdash;the gift you offer me is one of which I am not worthy! Eh! no, I
  do not want your friendship&mdash;it consoles me&mdash;exasperates
  me&mdash;and I have no need of either one or the other&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'What do you want?' he asked, in a moved tone.</p>

  <p>Julie looked at him with something like despair in her large, candid eyes.
  'I have need of rest,' she said. 'And to forget you during some time.' She
  sank on to the ottoman, her bright skirts about her, and clasped her hands in
  her lap.</p>

  <p>'You shall not forget me,' said M. de Guibert quietly. She continued to
  look at him; her expression was now almost one of terror.</p>

  <p>'I want to be frank,' she answered, in a hoarse, hurried voice, 'with
  you&mdash;with myself. And in truth, in the trouble in which I am, I fear, to
  wrong one of us. Ah, <i>mon Dieu</i>! perhaps my remorse is greater than my
  wrong; perhaps this fear I feel would only offend he whom I love!'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert came nearer. He wore black, which further enhanced the
  youthful freshness of his face; a magnificent crimson rose, scented with
  perfume, was fastened into the lace of his cravat.</p>

  <p>'<i>Do</i> you love M. de Mora?' he asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>Julie shrank back into the cushions of the ottoman.</p>

  <p>'If you could see the letter that I received this morning!' she cried
  desperately. 'It was so full of confidence in my affection! He writes of my
  thoughts, my very soul, with that clear certainty one uses when one feels
  intensely. Ah, <i>mon Dieu</i> by what fatality, by what charm, have you come
  to distract me?</p>

  <p>The young soldier rested his hands on the arm of the sofa, and regarded
  her steadily, with an eager look in his pleasant gray eyes.</p>

  <p>'Have I distracted you, Julie?' he asked under his breath.</p>

  <p>Julie de Lespinasse shrank still farther away from this presence, so
  redolent of the perfume of youth and health, from this firm, charming face,
  bending over her, so full of a gay, careless, yet intense and eager life. She
  looked at him with a keyed-up courage, an anxious defiance.</p>

  <p>'Why did I not die last September?' she stammered. 'I should then have
  died without regret, without having any reproaches to make to myself! Alas I
  feel that even now I would die for him&mdash;there is nothing I would not
  sacrifice to his good&mdash;!' She paused, then added wildly: 'These two
  months past I have no sacrifices left to make! I no longer belong to
  myself&mdash;I do not love more, but I love better.'</p>

  <p>He stooped down and pressed her to him. She tried to hold him off while
  her unsteady voice continued:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'But he will pardon me I have suffered so much! My body, my soul have been
  exhausted by the weight of my grief. His absence&mdash;this last persecution
  of the post, reduced me almost to despair. You&mdash;you have saved
  me&mdash;re-animated my heart, given me pleasure, interest in life...Ah, I
  know not whether I love or hate you for this!'</p>

  <p>'Kiss me, Julie,' was all he said.</p>

  <p>She quivered close to him, and caught at the lapels of his coat; then
  shuddered away, forcing herself out of his arms.</p>

  <p>'Tell me,' she cried in horror, 'does <i>friendship</i> speak like this?
  Why have I given you my confidence? Make me know myself, help me to regain my
  strength. My soul is in darkness and confusion!'</p>

  <p>'Julie! Julie, why this distress? I care for you! There is no one in the
  world who comes before you in my thoughts!'</p>

  <p>She saw that he was moved, but she saw also that his was a facile and
  superficial sentiment. Her tone sank to gentleness, and the great tears
  filled her frightened eyes.</p>

  <p>'Ah,' she replied, 'your travels will soon distract you from this
  affection!'</p>

  <p>She rose, hardly knowing what she was doing, her fingers plucked at the
  laces on her breast, a hectic colour showed beneath her eyes. 'Is this
  remorse?' she cried. 'Is it my fault&mdash;or yours? Is it your departure?
  <i>Grand Dieu!</i> what is it that persecutes me? I can no more.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert, shaken on his part, a little bewildered, wholly flattered,
  was instantly by her side, and would have caught hold of her, but she put him
  off.</p>

  <p>'Ask nothing of me,' she implored. 'In this moment I confide in you
  wholly&mdash;I could tell you all that has happened to me, all my life, but I
  would not sadden you with so much sorrow Ah, leave
  me&mdash;<i>adieu!</i>&mdash;I will see you to-morrow if I can face you after
  what I have said to-day!'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert, baffled, and finning his usual ways with women of no avail,
  remained a pace away from her, gazing intently at her face, which, from
  behind its veil of sorrow, was radiant with the glow, the promise, and the
  appeal of a whole-hearted passion.</p>

  <p>'Would to heaven that you were my friend, or that I had never seen you!'
  she cried. She rose and her movement was as if she pushed him away from her
  with vehement hands.</p>

  <p>'Will you write to me?' he cried.</p>

  <p>Julie de Lespinasse smiled. 'Do not forget that you have promised at once
  to burn my letters!' she said.</p>

  <p>She moved away from him lightly, as a mist-wreathed phantom. 'Do you think
  that you will be my friend?' she asked. 'Think it over&mdash;once only.' She
  had gained the door of her room, and stood with her fingers on the handle.
  'Do I ask too much?' she murmured. Then, without looking at him, was
  gone.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert was roused as he had seldom been before. He still never
  thought of abandoning his journey, but he began to think with even more
  keenness of his return&mdash;if this seductive woman should be in the same
  humour. She had ended the interview, and he was too wise to endeavour to
  remain in her apartment or to force himself into her presence. With his fancy
  excited and his imagination stimulated, he left her to seek, not the society
  of Madame de Montsauge, that was dull by contrast, but the graceful aroma of
  coquetry and adulation that perfumed the lovely apartments of Madame de
  Boufflers.</p>

  <p>Two days later, Julie, believing that he had departed on the Tuesday, was
  surprised and stabbed to hear that he was still in Paris. Thursday morning
  found her at the door of his lodgings in the rue Taranne. She learnt that he
  had left a few hours before.</p>

  <p>Julie's mind beat over two questions as she returned, lonely, in her hired
  carriage: 'Why did he not tell me he was staying longer? With whom did he
  pass those last twenty-four hours that he denied to me?' She knew that she
  had no right even to wonder about his movements, and she came back to her
  little <i>salon</i> with complete desolation in her heart. She had a ghastly
  sense of doing the same thing twice, as if she had known every throb of this
  restless anguish before. This bewildered her&mdash;she could not tell for
  whom she mourned. Her lover was like a phantom to her, with his pale face and
  reproachful eyes, a phantom obscured by distance and illness; unreal to her
  also was the other man, who had lately left her, his firm, vivid face seemed
  to have passed into the figures of her dreams. She viewed the desert of her
  exceeding loneliness and knew not what she lacked, yet knew that it was
  neither of these men&mdash;but love Love was her need, and twice love had
  left her; his light was withdrawn, and she groped in darkness.</p>

  <p>Exceedingly bitter was it to be again alone, again watching for the post,
  living from day to day, dragging the unwilling hours on to she knew not what
  glimmer of hope.</p>

  <p>Ah! how weary she was of delayed fruition; this budless spring, this
  undrained cup, this deferred promise, this waiting&mdash;this postponement of
  all satisfactions and desires. Like a creature at bay, she turned, hardly
  knowing what she did, to snatch some fire from the torch of life before her
  destiny threw it smoking at her feet. She wrote to M. de Guibert at
  Strassburg. 'I know not if I regret you,' she said, 'but I miss you as I
  would my pleasure.'</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">Throughout the long days she continued to write to M. de
  Guibert letters ironical, tender, bewildered, frank, full of a seething
  unhappiness and an unfathomable yearning. The pang of separation coloured her
  appealing lines; on every page she laid bare the fact that the absence of the
  man to whom she wrote was her greatest anguish; unutterable forlornness
  showed even in the sentences that she strove to render gay; the struggle and
  impatience of a strong nature tinged with bitterness her lightest words.
  Every letter was as the proud protest of a woman being dragged unwillingly to
  her knees, forced to the edge of a terrible abyss. An incurable melancholy
  pervaded these letters. She never ceased to repeat that she was ill and sad;
  she showed that the words of Bossuet, '<i>on trouve au fond de tout le vide e
  le néant</i>' echoed in her bereft soul. The replies to these outpourings,
  though full of affection and gratitude, were such as she might have shown to
  M. de Mora himself. And her correspondent did not hesitate to tell her that
  he was also writing to Madame de Montsauge and Madame de Boufflers, and Julie
  had to endure the tortures of futile jealousy.</p>

  <p>'Give us our places,' she cried. 'But, as I love not to change, give me
  one a little worthy&mdash;not on the level of that unhappy person!' She had
  already humiliated herself to the extent of allowing this man to speak of her
  and his mistress in one breath. She sensed further humiliations ahead of her
  unless she could cure herself of this over-eager, over-sensitive affection,
  which was beginning to absorb her entire life. She continued to write to
  Madrid; her love for M. de Mora was not dead, but dwelt in the bottom of her
  soul&mdash;a haunting, a reproachful, and desperate thing. When she heard of
  his serious relapse she was ill with agony, and made desperate efforts to
  accomplish his return to Paris.</p>

  <p>'The Spanish doctors will kill him,' she said. 'To save himself he must
  come.' Soon she added: 'And to save me.'</p>

  <p>She sincerely believed that his dear presence would kill the new influence
  that was besetting her; she longed to gaze into his sincere eyes, to hear his
  voice trembling with love for her, to forget everything in the circle of his
  arms. What did those schemes of marriage, that had once meant so much to her,
  matter now? Julie cared for nothing save that her lover should come and save
  her from herself. She seldom slept without opium now; often she would start
  up in the night from painful slumbers full of crowded dreams, draw back the
  red curtains, and stare across the familiar room, looking unfamiliar in the
  dull light of the night-lamp. And then, amid the circling terrors of her
  distraught loneliness, when others might fancy they beheld a vision of an
  angel, or a God come to save them, she would see the pale, beautiful face of
  the man who loved her, looking down on her with infinite tenderness and deep
  compassion. Only the undiminished force of her soul, the astonishing fire of
  her spirit, enabled her to endure such sufferings. She lived in a perpetual
  fever, the drug in her veins, the passion in her heart, equally intoxicating
  her. Sometimes she was gay, witty, sometimes she laughed, always she was
  incurably sad; always like a creature possessed, moving through her
  accustomed life with instinctive charm and grace, but with all her inner
  being under the spell of devastating afflictions. Her illness made great
  advance. She was devouring herself, using up her vital forces, consuming her
  own life with the impetuous violence of her feelings; her forced activity was
  paid for by long hours of prostration. She would then lie like one dead on
  the crimson bed in a sleep not due to opium. There came dolorous months in
  the summer when she heard neither from Madrid, where M. de Mora lay sick, nor
  from Berlin, where M. de Guibert was being fêted&mdash;then she received news
  of the serious relapse of the former, and a cold note from the latter. 'You
  find me very unjust&mdash;very difficult,' she wrote in her desperation, to
  Berlin. 'I am nothing of all that&mdash;I am very truthful, very sick and
  very unhappy. Oh, yes, very unhappy! Do you think, in the trouble that I am,
  that I have the power to constrain myself?' Then fiercely she set herself to
  win this man on whom her last chance of happiness seemed to depend.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'Our friendship must be grand, strong, and entire&mdash;our connection
  tender, solid, and intimate&mdash;or it must be nothing at all. I can never
  repent of having let you see my entire soul. If it does not please you, you
  can despise it. Eh <i>bien</i>, let us be sincere, and neither ashamed, nor
  embarrassed. We may return to where we were when we parted, and believe that
  we have dreamt. We will add this episode to the chapter of life that is
  called "experience," and we will conduct ourselves as well-bred people to
  whom it is not permitted to talk of their dreams.'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Then the imperative need of her nature overcame this delicate pride.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'You will not tell me what place I am to have in your affections. Do you
  fear to give me too much, or too little? Your hesitation is perhaps prudent,
  but it is not noble. Youth is so magnificent that it loves to be prodigal,
  but you are as grudging as if you were old, or rich.'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Her pen went on to reproaches:&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'As soon as you return you will go to Montauban&mdash;and after that a
  thousand other projects! On my honour, I think it was a misfortune in my life
  that day I went, a year ago, to the Moulin Joli. I was very far from needing
  to form a new tie; my life, my soul were so filled that I wanted no new
  interest; but this is pitiful! Are we free? Is it that all that is could be
  otherwise? You were not free to tell me if you would write often, and I am
  not free to say I do not greatly desire it&mdash;'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>So Julie, at her cylinder desk, her frail body shaken, her hastening hand,
  frequently stayed by her cough or an attack of breathless pain. She had
  barely sealed this letter when M. D'Alembert arrived with one from Madrid.
  Julie seized it, taking no more notice of the bearer than if he had been a
  lackey, and tore open the seals that bore the impress of the Fuentès' proud
  coat of arms. M. D'Alembert retired to the fireplace, seated himself on one
  of the low chairs, and gazed with timid and adoring affection at the figure
  of Julie de Lespinasse.</p>

  <p>This man, once so gay, so ironical, so witty&mdash;a leader of profound
  thought, the prophet of a tremendous movement, was now only existing to serve
  the sorrow of this woman that he did not understand. In her white dimity
  skirt and white ruffled muslin bed-jacket with her dark hair unpowdered and
  her face unrouged, Julie looked, to the anxious eyes of M. D'Alembert, ill
  indeed.</p>

  <p>Julie put down the letter. She felt her soul freeze with horror. M. de
  Mora could no longer disguise his own creeping fear; it showed through the
  words with which he endeavoured to reassure her; he was weak, confined to his
  room, there had been another bleeding from the lungs, fainting fits,
  fever.</p>

  <p>'Three hundred leagues apart and a mortal illness!' cried Julie again in
  her soul. How fantastic now seemed her hopes of the future&mdash;an
  honourable marriage, love, and repose...She rose.</p>

  <p>'Bad news?' asked M. D'Alembert, also rising. Julie looked at him blankly;
  she had, in truth, forgotten his presence.</p>

  <p>'Oh, <i>mon ami</i>,' she replied, 'as good as I deserve.'</p>

  <p>She went into her chamber, shutting out all this passionate devotion that
  trembled with eagerness to serve and console. And it was to another man that
  she wrote: 'You only have the power to suspend for some instants my grief,
  and this moment's relief attaches me to you for life.'</p>

  <p>The thought of M. de Mora was like a spectre before her; more than ever
  her one relief was in writing to M. de Guibert:&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'You must have a little impatience to know if I exist still, or
  not&mdash;<i>eh bien</i>, yes I am condemned to live, no longer free to die.
  It would be a wrong towards one who loves to live for me. I hope he will
  haste his return, but he cannot support the great heat, so I must wait. Oh
  <i>mon Dieu</i> I always to see pleasure deferred and sorrow present If you
  knew the need I have for repose&mdash;for a year I have been on the
  rack.'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Page after page she filled, one impassioned phrase leaping after the
  other:&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'Adieu, once more,' she ended. 'My quality of folly is worthy of your
  pity. How many letters do you open before mine? Three&mdash;ten?'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Almost every day she wrote to him, finding in this occupation the real
  interest of her life. She hardly noticed the half-startled surprise of the
  man to whom she wrote, save to treat his prudence, his care to associate M.
  D'Alembert in their correspondence, his advice to her not to suffer on his
  account, with a noble disdain.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'Your letters might be written to any woman of your acquaintance. Mine
  could have but one address.'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>His rare and careless tenderness angered her ardent, delicate soul.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'What does my suffering matter to you? What value am I to you? Your soul
  is so occupied, your life so full and so agitated, how is it that you have
  time to pity me, or to respond to my friendship?'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Hearing in the <i>salon</i> of Madame de Boufflers a discussion as to the
  present state of the love affairs of M. de Guibert, she wrote to him in a
  tone of scarcely-concealed jealousy the whole scene.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'They say that you are in love&mdash;no longer with Madame de
  Montsauge&mdash;"but why, then, does he go to Prussia? Is it, perhaps, to
  cure himself, or to inspire a warmer sentiment in the woman he loves?" And I,
  who had been silent, was asked what I knew. "<i>Ah!</i> I know nothing at
  all! I know that he is in Berlin, that he is well, that the king has received
  him graciously, that he reviews troops, that he will go into
  Silesia&mdash;and that is all that interests me." And then we spoke of the
  Opera, of Madame la Dauphine, and a thousand other <i>interesting</i>
  things.'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Soon she changed this tone of light irony for one of a deep and humble
  tenderness:&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'You are so strong, so calm, so occupied, that you cannot be touched,
  either by great misfortunes or little chagrins. I shall disgust you with my
  soul, so little, so ordinary. But I cannot help showing it to you&mdash;when
  I look into the future, I feel my soul freeze! This is not because greatness
  frightens me, but because that which is great merits admiration more than
  love. Ah, I am stupid! I am mad! I am worse than that&mdash;I am
  wearisome!'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>She praised M. de Mora with desperate sincerity; she showed a feverish
  anxiety lest the news of her new friendship should reach Madrid.</p>

  <p>M. de Chastellux, having rallied her on her correspondence with Berlin,
  she wrote in terror:&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'What have you told him? Do you burn my letters? Nay, I see them falling
  from your pockets, your portfolios&mdash;the confusion of your papers
  frightens me.'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Proudly she answered his conventional, evasive letters, which began to
  assume a tone of rebuff:&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'You have no need to be loved&mdash;you do not wish to make me suffer?
  What price, then, do you put on this connection where all the advantage is to
  be on my side? Alas! one must be calm to reply to the questions of
  indifference! Unhappiness has made me too stupid to answer what you ask me. I
  reproach myself that I have shown you the sufferings of my soul. I have no
  right to your compassion&mdash;you owe me nothing. I detest&mdash;I abhor the
  fatality that made me write you that first letter. <i>Mon Dieu</i>! if you
  knew how little my soul is! It sees only one thing in nature worth occupying
  itself with&mdash;Caesar, Voltaire, the King of Prussia, appear worthy of
  admiration without being worthy of envy. I will not tell you what that one
  thing is. But do not put me beside the other women of your acquaintance. You
  do not realise my worth; believe that I know how to suffer, and how to
  die&mdash;see if I resemble these women who know how to please and
  amuse!'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>With her utter sincerity, she saw that he was endeavouring to write to her
  and avoid personal allusions.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'In the name of God, talk to me no more of the news of <i>The Gazette</i>,
  which I never read!'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Towards the end of July a bitter cry escaped from her distracted
  heart:&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'...the greatest distances are not those that Nature has marked by
  leagues&mdash;the Indies are not so far from Paris as the 27th of June is
  from the 15th of July. These are the real separations&mdash;the real
  distances&mdash;the forgetfulness of the soul, which resembles death, but is
  worse, for it lasts longer.'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>She was not deceived in the character of the man who fascinated her; again
  and again she held the mirror up to him with a frankness to which his vanity
  was little used.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'You are ardent you are passionate! you are young, you are capable of all
  that is strong and great. But there will never be anything in your life but
  actions you are incapable of sensibility and tenderness, of all the sweet and
  pleasant virtues...<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>These judgments were annulled by bursts of almost maternal
  tenderness:&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'You are amiable to have thought to have enlarged your writing for me, but
  now I regret that I complained of the smallness of your characters, for I am
  robbed of several lines! Ah, <i>mon Dieu</i>! remain as you are. I will
  complain of nothing. Write with a fly's feet, make the tour of the
  world&mdash;in a word, do not change a hair's-breadth from your manner of
  being. I know not if this is the best possible, but to me there could be
  nothing more agreeable. Is not this praise <i>fade</i>? Do not mock me. I am
  very stupid, but I assure you that I am a good creature, am I not?'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>So Julie, during the hot days of summer to the man half Europe was
  fêting.</p>

  <p>His replies were dictated by kindliness, some vanity, and some alarm at
  the stormy soul being revealed to him. He was not in love with her, and did
  not wish to be. In all the distractions of his brilliant travels, he would
  probably have forgotten that she had ever awakened any emotion in his heart
  had not her letters, like burning arrows, pursued him from stage to stage
  until he was troubled, moved, restless, half-tempted to respond to this
  awakening passion that he strove to ignore.</p>

  <p>He used the disguise 'friendship' till it was threadbare. The eyes, the
  lips of Julie, smiled with anguish at him from behind this age-worn mask that
  her contemptuous fingers removed so early from her face. She breathed 'love'
  from every line she wrote, and he was vexed, not understanding.</p>

  <p>To the woman, shut up in Paris, came the dread that this errant spirit
  would completely forget her.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'The habit of unhappiness spoils all,' she wrote. 'When I opened your
  letter my first sensation was one of fear&mdash;with how many regrets do you
  fill my life! I enjoy your friendship; it would be my consolation, my
  pleasure&mdash;and you are a thousand leagues away, and I cannot free myself
  from the fear that your occupations, distance, a thousand distractions will
  cause you to forget an interest that never filled your heart, and that time
  had never made a habit...I am so fond of you that I cannot impose on myself
  the least restraint. I prefer to have to ask your pardon than never to commit
  any faults. I have no pride with you&mdash;I hate prudence, I hate those
  conventional friendships that substitute discretion for interest, delicacy
  for sensibility. I love abandon&mdash;I would that one should be so with
  me!'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Yet when he, animated by the warm torrent of her words, responded with
  some of her own heat, the distress of her soul found vent in reproaches.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'Your friendship is a new unhappiness for me. Ah, why have you penetrated
  into my soul, why shown me yours? Why have you established an intimacy
  between two people whom everything separates? Sometimes I check myself in my
  desire for your return, for I fear that your affection will be my
  affliction.'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>When she heard that his voyages were to be shortened, her first impulse
  was one of jealousy.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'To whom have you made the sacrifice of Sweden?'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Towards the autumn his letters ceased, and Julie humiliated herself in her
  anguish:&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'Here is my fifth letter without a reply&mdash;how many people make you
  such advances?'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>M. de Guibert sent news of his illness as an excuse, and the unhappy Julie
  redoubled her passionate tenderness while reproaching him for the formal way
  in which he acknowledged her letters:&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>'I do not want your gratitude; it is a sentiment that I abhor&mdash;and,
  strangely enough, you are the last man in the world whom I make an effort to
  please.'<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>This was the last letter that she wrote to Austria, for M. de Guibert was
  returning to Paris.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p class="first">While Julie was absorbed by the secret agony of her
  correspondence with M. de Guibert, M. D'Alembert was loyally engaged in
  endeavouring to bring about the return of M. de Mora to Paris.</p>

  <p>Not only did he wish to please Julie, whose grief he believed to be
  entirely due to the absence and illness of her friend, but he himself
  sincerely loved the young Spaniard, whose noble qualities and vivid charm had
  attracted so many hearts.</p>

  <p>The philosopher engaged the famous M. Anne Charles Lorry, the most famous
  doctor in Paris, to write to M. de Mora that his advice was an immediate
  return to the banks of the Seine, away from the pernicious treatment of the
  Spanish doctors.</p>

  <p>Having enlisted the sympathy of the warm-hearted Duc de Villa Hermosa in
  the scheme, M. D'Alembert was confident of success, and ventured to tell
  Julie so.</p>

  <p>'I believe,' he said one evening, returning from Madame Geoffrin to find
  Julie alone, 'that we shall soon have him back.'</p>

  <p>The philosopher, in his single-mindedness, used no name. Julie thought he
  meant the man who absorbed her own heart.</p>

  <p>'In a day or so,' she replied faintly.</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert stared at her with his mild, anxious eyes.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>! not so soon as that. Lorry's letter will have hardly
  reached them by then.'</p>

  <p>Julie saw her mistake, and the painful colour flooded her haggard face.
  She clasped her hands more tightly in her lap, and leant forward from her low
  cane chair towards the fire that played between the iron dogs.</p>

  <p>'My head is confused,' she said hoarsely. 'I have spoken with forty people
  to-day, dined with Madam Chatillon, and entertained M. de Chastellux. <i>Mon
  Dieu</i> how wearisome he is with his comedies of La Chrevette! And then M.
  de Crillon, with his heiress&mdash;and all these people spoke of M. de
  Guibert, who returns this month.'</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert liked the young soldier, but his faithful heart did not
  consider him on the same plane with M. de Mora.</p>

  <p>'Ah, yes,' he said pleasantly. 'These fashionable folk must have their
  little god&mdash;to-day one, to-morrow another. This young man is more worthy
  than some, but, <i>au fond</i> commonplace!'</p>

  <p>Julie shivered; it seemed to her that her infidelity must be branded on
  the face she shaded with her frail hand from the heat of the flames.</p>

  <p>'I meant M. de Mora,' continued M. D'Alembert eagerly. 'Would not that
  cheer you, <i>mon amie</i>, if he were to return?'</p>

  <p>She avoided his tender glance.</p>

  <p>'Certainly M. de Mora had better return,' she answered slowly, 'for the
  sake of&mdash;all his friends.'</p>

  <p>Her gaze travelled nervously round the familiar room; the red hangings,
  the comfortable furniture, the prints, the busts, the mirrors oppressed her
  with a sense of monotony; they fretted her almost as much as did the presence
  of M. D'Alembert.</p>

  <p>She thought of the old story of the sweet basil that, perfumed and
  fragrant, yet when placed under a stone, bred a scorpion; so her delicate and
  pleasant life had suddenly brought forth a bitter sting.</p>

  <p>She wore still her quilted mantle of white taffeta; it was open on her
  gown and petticoat of yellow gauze over taffeta, of the same hue. The
  firelight gave all a golden pink tint, like the warm colours of the inside of
  a shell. Her face was turned from M. D'Alembert; he could only see the
  charming, irregular profile, with the tip-tilted nose and sensitive
  mouth.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon ami</i>,' he said, with a tenderness that could not be any longer
  suppressed. 'What is your trouble. What estranges us?'</p>

  <p>These words frightened Julie; they approached too near her deeply-hidden
  secret. She sat quite still.</p>

  <p>'I believe that you have something on your mind,' continued the little
  philosopher, with the most delicate and loving solicitude. 'You are grieved,
  as I am, for M. de Mora, but surely, it is more than this that disturbs you
  so. And it is not possible that you have so changed that you do not wish to
  give me your confidence&mdash;after thirteen years, Julie?'</p>

  <p>The unhappy woman shivered, and desperately rallied all her powers to her
  defence. She was forced now to regard this man as a personality, and not any
  longer as the mere part of her life that he had lately become. Deceit and
  insincerity were so unnatural to her, that it took all her strength to
  endeavour to turn aside the suspicions of M. D'Alembert.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon ami</i>,' she said in husky tones, 'I am not well, and that is the
  beginning and end of it&mdash;you know how I suffer. My body is exhausted, my
  head stupid&mdash;Eh, <i>mon ami</i>!' she roused herself to speak with
  feeling, 'do you think that I do not appreciate you?'</p>

  <p>As she looked at him and saw his quivering face and eyes filled with
  tears, some of her ancient tenderness for him returned for a moment.</p>

  <p>'Why does it not satisfy me&mdash;this love?' she asked herself in
  torment.</p>

  <p>'There is, then, nothing between us?' murmured M. D'Alembert.</p>

  <p>Julie gave him her hand.</p>

  <p>'What could there be?'</p>

  <p>He gazed into her eyes, pressed her fingers between his, and was
  completely reassured. The easiness of her dominion over him chafed Julie. She
  was impatient of the burden of this affection that forced her into deceit;
  her usual irritation took the place of her transitory compassion. She urged
  him to leave her, under plea of fatigue, and the little philosopher, happier
  than he had been for some time, went upstairs to that poor little chamber
  that he preferred to apartments in the Louvre, and wrote to the Duc de Villa
  Hermosa.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had gone, Julie's assumed languor left her. She started up
  and, full of feverish energy, threw off her mantle. M. de Guibert returned to
  Paris to-day. He had promised in his last letter from Vienna, his first visit
  should be to her. He would see her before Madame de Montsauge, he said, and
  would have done so, even if that lady had been the nearer on his route as she
  was the farther.</p>

  <p>'I owe so much,' he wrote, 'to our friendship and your sufferings.'</p>

  <p>Would he come to-night? It was yet early&mdash;what would his visit mean?
  How was he going to interpret this 'friendship' of which he spoke so
  much?</p>

  <p>He was coming back with redoubled fame and prestige, approved by Voltaire,
  by the King of Prussia. How much time would he have to give to her? Would she
  not lose him again in that distraction of society which had now become so
  hateful to her, but which he adored?</p>

  <p>These questions resolved themselves from that chaos which was poor Julie's
  heart. She, could hardly have named any of her sentiments; she only knew that
  she was waiting for this man's return as a prisoner might for sentence of
  release. All her reason, her judgment, was suspended by the force of this one
  great desire. She turned eagerly to one of the long mirrors fixed in the
  wall. Many men had been charmed by her&mdash;three, at least had loved her.
  Why not this one? Then her mood swiftly changed. A woman of
  forty&mdash;plain, disfigured, ill! Could she make him forget these things?
  In that moment, she could have gone to any damnation for the beauty of Madame
  de Boufflers, Madame de in Vallière, or Madame de Forcalquier.</p>

  <p>For the first time in her life, a primitive passion inspired her, and with
  it came the instinctive desire for the first of female rights and
  needs&mdash;loveliness.</p>

  <p>Hateful to her seemed the powder and pomade, the flounces and lacings, the
  art and taste that disguised her natural haggardness, her lack of health and
  bloom.</p>

  <p>Yet it was no ungracious image that the mirror reflected; her fineness,
  her grace, her delicacy, her distinction were independent of youth and
  beauty; her seductive and exotic charm was a rarer thing than ordinary
  comeliness. The power and fire of her dark eyes, the turn of her elegant
  head, her whole personality, fragrant with such breathless emotion, were as
  enchantments blinding men to what she lacked.</p>

  <p>She caught up her mantle, put it on and then put it off again; flung her
  scarf of silver gauze about her shoulders, then dragged it away. Then
  hastened about the room, and, with hurried breath, blew out all the candles
  save those that stood on the cylinder desk between the two busts.</p>

  <p>'He will not come,' she thought, bitterly scornful of herself. 'There are
  a dozen women who interest him more.'</p>

  <p>In the lovely glow of the firelight she stood erect, in the attitude of
  one who meets destiny with a high heart. And then she heard his step, his
  voice in the ante-chamber.</p>

  <p>He was laughing with the lackey as he took off his coat, the air of a
  little popular tune was on his lips. '<i>Jouez, dancez, amusez vous</i>.'</p>

  <p>A sensation of complete terror swept over Julie. She wanted to hide, to
  avoid him; she moved desperately farther from the door. The next instant he
  was in her presence.</p>

  <p>He brought with him the freshness of the autumn rain, the keen outer air,
  a sense of youth and health that was so much stronger than the close perfumes
  of the <i>salon</i> that it overwhelmed and scattered. Joyous, radiant,
  flushed with success, adventures, and a curious anticipation, he came towards
  her. She had not remembered him so handsome; his firm, fresh face, his
  strong, vigorous figure, were dearer than even her dreams had thought them.
  This moment showed her her own heart clearly; all doubts, terrors,
  hesitations, remorse, regret, were swept away by an overwhelming emotion.</p>

  <p>'So you have come!' she exclaimed faintly. She spoke from behind the
  ottoman, leaning against the mirror. She knew that she could not endure him
  to touch her&mdash;not yet.</p>

  <p>'To you,' he replied; his bold and charming voice was more than ever
  serene and self-confident.</p>

  <p>Julie, all glimmering and gold against the gilt mirror, in her gauze and
  taffeta, in the rose and honey-coloured light of the two distant candles and
  the steady fire, neither moved nor spoke; but her look and attitude were more
  eloquent than either gesture or speech.</p>

  <p>To M. de Guibert she was illuminated by the glow of her wonderful letters.
  His curiosity flamed almost into passion; her great eyes seemed to promise
  unfathomable delights. Was this marvellous woman to be the crown of his
  breathless success?</p>

  <p>'What have you to say to me?' he asked unsteadily.</p>

  <p>She turned away from him, and gazed into the mirror against which her
  shoulder rested.</p>

  <p>'What can I say to you that I have not already said?'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert smiled.</p>

  <p>'You have said so much.'</p>

  <p>'Too much! I revealed my soul before I was asked to. What do you think of
  me?'</p>

  <p>He leant against the corner of the ottoman, looking at her. He wore a dark
  blue travelling suit and high boots; his hair was unpowdered&mdash;it showed
  a darker brown than Julie had imagined it would be from his fair complexion;
  his face was slightly tanned; he was alert and vivid with health and the joy
  of life. Her wild glance noted him in the mirror; she felt him so utterly
  dear that her instinct was to creep to his side, like a dog, and implore a
  caress.</p>

  <p>She knew that she would not have asked in vain; her instinct told her that
  he was trying to read her humour, waiting for her signal.</p>

  <p>Julie could not give it; she mastered her passionate heart, and turned to
  him with a quiet, if trembling, smile.</p>

  <p>'Tell me of your triumphs! Of Voltaire&mdash;of Fréderic.'</p>

  <p>A slight shade of puzzled disappointment came over M. de Guibert's candid
  face. From her letters he had not expected this reception. He was not,
  however, yet sufficiently sure of his own feelings to take the initiative,
  and he adopted her tone with an ease that cost Julie a secret pang.</p>

  <p>'The King was perfect. Voltaire&mdash;ages! He composed some atrocious
  verses. <i>Eh bien</i>, old age is a mistake!'</p>

  <p>'To youth, nothing is right,' said Julie, 'save a mirror that reflects
  itself.'</p>

  <p>She smiled at him with a faint irony; she was suddenly fatigued to the
  point of exhaustion. He noticed her swooning look.</p>

  <p>'You have been ill&mdash;you are still ill, <i>mon ami</i>.'</p>

  <p>The tender name shook all her fortitude; she would have answered with
  uncontained tenderness had not M. D'Alembert at that moment entered.</p>

  <p>He had heard M. de Guibert's voice on the stairs, and had come, beaming,
  from his letter-writing to greet the returned hero.</p>

  <p>Julie soon crept away to her chamber; she did not go to bed. When M. de
  Guibert left, she sent Madame Saint-Martin after him with a little note
  begging him to come on the morrow when M. D'Alembert should be at the
  Academy.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p class="first">She had known by his look, his air, that he would come, and
  to the exact minute he was at her door. He, the most sought-after man in
  Paris in the first glow of his return!</p>

  <p>Julie told herself with a wildly-leaping heart, that he had not had time
  to see Madame de Montsauge, or Madame de Boufflers&mdash;she knew that he,
  had spent his morning at the Ministry, and the early afternoon with M. de
  Crillon and M. de Chastellux; she might have been with them, but had
  purposely kept herself for this meeting. On her old stool by the fire, she
  waited for him. Her ill-health was so forgotten, it was as if she had never
  known suffering. The candles were not lit, and the firelight alone dispelled
  the crossing shadows; the <i>pot-pourri</i> in the lacquer jar was powerful
  in the close air. Outside, a little autumn wind rattled at the panes of the
  long windows.</p>

  <p>Julie was in white gauze with a single line of silver at the hem, a
  taffeta jacket ruffled with blonde lace, a broad black ribbon round her
  throat, her hair powdered in loose curls. At her tight waist hung her
  chatelaine with dozens of little trifles in gold and ivory, and tucked into
  the muslin at her bosom was one of Madame de Marchais's late roses, a coral
  pink bloom from the gardens of the King.</p>

  <p>She made no pretence of reading or sewing. Her hands were clasped in her
  lap, her gaze fixed on the flames, and when he was announced she rose
  instantly and stood waiting.</p>

  <p>He was radiant, on the crest of the wave, intoxicated with life, joyous,
  self-confident...to Julie almost divine in his glowing vitality.</p>

  <p>She moved to the window without a word of greeting, and stood leaning
  against the cold panes, looking up at the dim purple sky above the dark
  house-tops. A new moon, a line of crystal light, showed faintly. As he came
  and took her in his arms, she dosed her eyes and let her head fall on his
  shoulder. She was conscious of no feeling save a sensation of extraordinary
  relief; warmth and ease seemed to encompass her&mdash;at last! At last!</p>

  <p>To M. de Guibert, her light, half-swooning weight, the silent droop of her
  body against his, gave a thrill he had hardly known before. He felt all her
  soul come out from her like the essence of a flower drawn by the beat of the
  sun.</p>

  <p>Silent, he gazed down at her and dreamed of unknown paradises, delicacies
  of love and passion hitherto unrealised.</p>

  <p>Julie lifted her pale face, and kissed him as he had never yet been
  kissed&mdash;kissed him again and again, drawing his fine head down by the
  tight clasp of her frail hands about his neck. He was as swept off his feet
  as any boy with his first love; he forgot everything, but this moment that
  she made so wonderful, so magic!</p>

  <p>Gone was all his wit, his poise. He stammered out immortal
  commonplace.</p>

  <p>'Julie&mdash;Julie, do you love me?'</p>

  <p>She answered with her trembling lips on his warm cheek,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'My love, I love you as one ought to love, with excess, with madness,
  transport and despair!'</p>

  <p>She drew slightly back, and gazed at his flushed, triumphant and joyous
  face, across which the last daylight fell. Her hands crept up and caressed
  his undressed, wind-disordered hair.</p>

  <p>'It seems to me,' she added, 'as if I did not do enough for you in loving
  you with all my soul&mdash;in being ready to live or die for you. You are
  worth more than that Ah! I can do nothing but love you; and what is that
  worth? Is it not natural to love you? But I can do better than that&mdash;I
  know how to suffer&mdash;I would renounce my happiness for yours.'</p>

  <p>He caught the contagion of her breathless passion. It was as if he held
  fire in his arms that scorched to his very heart.</p>

  <p>'You magic creature!' he cried, and kissed her throat until she panted. 'I
  will make your happiness mine, Julie.'</p>

  <p>'Ay,' she murmured wildly, 'you must love me to madness, for I shall
  desire it. I exact nothing, I shall pardon all. I shall never be out of
  humour&mdash;my love, I am perfect, for I love you to perfection!</p>

  <p>She held him off now, stood away from him, staring at him through the dusk
  between the young moon and the fading fire.</p>

  <p>'I want you! I fear you!' she said. 'I love you! I dread you! I am wholly
  yours, now and always&mdash;you have created me.' Her light hands went to her
  heart. 'This is yours! Alas! perhaps, like God, you have repented your
  work!'</p>

  <p>He caught hold of her again, he could not keep pace with her exalted,
  tremendous rush of anguished passion. Her emotions were at once too high, too
  fine, too swift for him to understand them, but she had roused all his
  senses, excited him with a sweet bewilderment.</p>

  <p>'Ah!' she cried sharply, 'if you pity me, do not tell me so! I cannot do
  otherwise than as I have done! A force irresistible has brought me to this
  moment&mdash;everything abandons me, save the power to say I love
  you&mdash;past death, past despair!'</p>

  <p>'Before God I love you,' he answered eagerly.' I did not know it was like
  this&mdash;I did not know!'</p>

  <p>She clung to him, catching at his collar.</p>

  <p>Do you know now? Ah, do you? Can you love me as I love you? Look at
  me&mdash;I am nothing or everything, as you decide. Fire or ashes, as you
  will. I am worth nothing save if you think me so. Ah! I give you all I
  have&mdash;my pride, my vanity, my pleasure&mdash;all my existence&mdash;all,
  all to love you! You shall see if I know how to love. I have waited for you,
  I love you! I would be everything to you and afterwards die!'</p>

  <p>Her words were like a sob; beneath the ecstatic note of her abandon of
  tenderness sounded the agony of tragic premonition. There was something of
  torture in her voice, her gestures, her inspired look. He saw this, and it
  troubled him. He missed in her that complete joyousness that awaited him at
  the threshold of this new-found paradise.</p>

  <p>'You are not happy&mdash;you suffer,' he stammered. 'Are you unhappy,
  Julie?'</p>

  <p>'You and my unhappiness are all that remain to me in the entire world. I
  have no interests, no friends, no needs. To love you, to see you, or to
  die&mdash;that is the first and last wish of my soul!'</p>

  <p>With a half-cry he caught her to him closely; she exulted in his embrace.
  It was as if she stood a-tiptoe and caught hold at last of the flying feet of
  all her winged dreams...</p>

  <p>She opened her eyes on his kisses, the dusk and the moon.</p>

  <p>'However you judge me, however you think of me, you must know that you
  have never been loved as I love you!'</p>

  <p>She dragged herself away from him, and stood leaning against the bust of
  Voltaire, white as herself, in the deep twilight.</p>

  <p>'To-morrow&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;to all eternity. What can I tell you?
  There is needed a new language to interpret what I have in my soul.'</p>

  <p>Not even the rapt, eager melody of her letters had prepared M. de Guibert
  for this still transport of passion.</p>

  <p>He strove against her fascination. He remembered that he did not want this
  tremendous, this overwhelming thing in his life.</p>

  <p>'I am your friend, your best friend,' he began painfully. 'I would do you
  no harm!'</p>

  <p>'Ha!' interrupted Julie. 'You find me too difficult already? Alas, I said
  I was perfect, but I have all the faults of an unhappy creature who loves
  with abandon and has only one desire, and one thought. Adieu, then!'</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>! you must not leave me so, you put me to the torture,
  Julie, indeed to the torture!'</p>

  <p>His usual facility of words had forsaken him; his charming voice was
  rough.</p>

  <p>'Do you not think that I suffer?' answered Julie proudly. 'Do not be
  afraid&mdash;I have given myself without being sure that the gift is
  valued.'</p>

  <p>'Do not talk so, Julie. On my life I&mdash;I&mdash;' he faltered in his
  speech.</p>

  <p>'If you loved me a thousandth part of how I love you, you would know what
  to say!' cried Julie. '<i>Mon Dieu</i>! I suffer&mdash;yes, but I envy not
  the joys of Heaven.'</p>

  <p>She again made a movement as if to leave him, but he caught at her
  glimmering figure in the gloom of the now dark room that only the dying heart
  of the fire faintly illuminated.</p>

  <p>'Julie, we must not love each other&mdash;we cannot! <i>Mon Dieu</i>! am I
  to blame? I never meant you ill. Remember all there is between us. Do not
  love me.'</p>

  <p>'You advise me not to love you, and you take me in your arms!' panted
  Julie. 'Eh, <i>grand Dieu</i>, you advise me not to love you! For whose sake,
  yours or mine? Tell me!'</p>

  <p>'For yours,' he answered sincerely. 'I would not see you suffer.'</p>

  <p>'Ah! I have an infallible remedy!' replied Julie wildly. 'How sweet it
  would be to me if I could think it would be a relief to you! But you must
  love me, you must! It is impossible that there is no response in your
  heart!'</p>

  <p>'There is&mdash;too much,' he said, in fierce agitation. 'Then love me!'
  cried Julie triumphantly.</p>

  <p>As she spoke she drew herself away from him 'Ring for lights,' she said.
  'I hear M. D'Alembert without.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert was too confused to be able to find the bell-rope. Julie
  threw open her bedchamber door and took up one of the lighted candles Madame
  Saint-Martin had put inside the door on the polished bureau. With this in her
  hand she went round the <i>salon</i>, lighting the candles on the
  chimney-piece and tables.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert watched her with gleaming eyes: bitter sweet and fiercely
  tender, triumphant in her abandon, the little leaping flames revealed her to
  him. His fears and scruples were lost in the quick surge of his blood. As she
  passed him, he snatched her to him and kissed her. The lit candle she carried
  fell at their feet and was extinguished in thin smoke that came acridly to
  their nostrils...</p>

  <p>When M. D'Alembert entered, a moment after, he found Julie looking at a
  stain of wax on her white taffeta skirt, and M. de Guibert in his dark
  travelling clothes standing by the sinking fire.</p>

  <p>The little philosopher had brought M. de Vaines and M. de Chastellux with
  him. Julie ordered coffee, that was brought in her little Sèvres cups.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert joined very little in the animated conversation&mdash;a
  thing unusual in him: he generally treated his companions as an audience.</p>

  <p>Continually he glanced at Julie. She was gay, witty, charming. He noticed
  how the other men admired her: the light in M. D'Alembert's eyes when he
  looked at her. Certainly she was a conquest to be envied.</p>

  <p>He took his leave early. There were calls on every moment of his time: he
  was full of a thousand projects for work, glory, dissipation, and amusement;
  he was more sought after than even when he had left Paris.</p>

  <p>But to-night he could think of nothing but Julie de Lespinasse. She was an
  incomparable creature: she loved like some heroine of antiquity&mdash;not
  like the boudoir women of to-day. But&mdash;she would want everything, and
  could he give even&mdash;anything? He was no professional rake, and the main
  interest of his life would never be with women. He wanted to be free of
  Madame de Montsauge. Of what use to leave this meek and easy mistress to
  involve himself with a woman like Julie de Lespinasse?</p>

  <p>And undoubtedly he must marry. His father had even named the lady to
  him&mdash;a certain Mademoiselle de Courcelles with a fine dowry, a girl
  fresh from school.</p>

  <p>His debts had increased with his fame. If this marriage could be postponed
  a year or so it would be the utmost that it could be, and he did not see how
  marriage and Julie de Lespinasse were both to be added to his life.</p>

  <p>Of course, he considered himself absolutely free to have what affairs he
  wished&mdash;even after his marriage: it was the custom of the great world to
  which he belonged. But he did not see Julie de Lespinasse in a secondary
  role. She had already shown a keen intolerance of Madame de Montsauge, and he
  suspected her of a fierce jealousy.</p>

  <p>She was tempestuous, uncontrolled, a woman who would make scenes. She was
  pledged to another man and loathed her infidelity. No softness, no laughter,
  no ease, was to be expected from the tragic love of Julie de Lespinasse.</p>

  <p>Yet this dark gift she had offered him with such proud abandon, attracted
  him. He, so avid for life, could hardly bring himself to pass by this
  experience. He knew that he might win a dozen women like Madame de Montsauge;
  it was not probable that he would ever meet another like Julie de
  Lespinasse.</p>

  <p>'My youth shall not leave my age anything to regret,' he had once said.
  Surely he would very keenly regret the love of Julie de Lespinasse.</p>

  <p>Yet when he reached his rooms in the rue Tarrane he wrote her a note
  counselling her to forget him and desperately evoking that 'friendship' she
  had already cast aside. But the next day he went to see her, and as soon as
  they were alone she was in his arms.</p>

  <p>She laughed at his letter. And he, before he had left her, had promised to
  break with Madame de Montsauge.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">She had never loved like this before; nay, more, she told
  herself that she had never known what love was. Her sentiment for M. de Mora
  was now as faint as had become that for M. Taafe, the Irishman. When she had
  first met him her senses and her emotions, fully roused for the first time,
  completely stifled her reason and her judgment. 'She knew neither remorse nor
  regrets, nor reflection. With closed eyes she abandoned herself to the
  torrent that swept her out to the magic sea of unutterable dreams.</p>

  <p>All that had hitherto made her life seemed but a feeble prelude to these
  enchanted days. She recovered her health, her charm, that had so little to do
  with her body, and became of a radiant loveliness. She lived but for her
  meetings with M. de Guibert: when he was not with her she worshipped him in a
  locked heart.</p>

  <p>Of the future she would not think. It seemed to her as if she was
  immortal, and that this golden time would last for ever. He had sacrificed
  Madame de Montsauge. Julie's passionate gratitude repaid him To the sacrifice
  that she had to make she hardly gave a thought. She continued to write,
  almost mechanically, to Spain. Instinctively she shrank from telling M. de
  Mora the truth; but she was so absorbed in her new passion that she hardly
  considered this problem. His letters to her were but paper and ink;
  D'Alembert's loyal talk of him but chatter; her memories of him utterly
  confused and blotted. So exalted was she, that she did not notice the
  monotony of love&mdash;that M. de Guibert said what M. de Mora had said,
  often in the same way and with the same accent, even though he was such a
  different man and his love was of such a different quality. Everything was
  new to her; even the commonplaces of this man to her were wrapt in flame And
  if she did not notice the samenesses in his wooing, neither did she notice
  the differences. She never saw that this strange, mutual attraction that she
  had fanned into stormy passion was not in the same category with the
  reverent, comprehending, tender affection that' had encompassed her for six
  years. She never reflected that the other man had remained for ever at her
  feet, had offered marriage, had risked everything to obtain the utmost honour
  for her...and that with this man she was rushing to a climax that was neither
  marriage nor honour.</p>

  <p>She was as one blindfolded and gagged, with cotton-wool in her ears; she
  only lived by and for and through Jacques Hippolyte de Guibert.</p>

  <p>What was left to her of reason was employed in concealing her secret. She
  was so lost in a crowd of brilliant people, she had been so long a law unto
  herself, she was so universally supposed to be pledged to M. de Mora, that it
  was not difficult for her to deceive an easy-going, lax, philosophical
  society.</p>

  <p>Her blazing spirits were believed to be owing to the better news from
  Spain: M. de Mora was supposed to be recovering, and to be thinking of taking
  M. Lorry's advice and returning to Paris.</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert was content in his blindness, for her great happiness made
  her kind to him again. He ceased to fret her. She tolerated him gaily: he was
  part of the furniture of her little <i>salon</i>; a comfortable, familiar
  thing.</p>

  <p>During this winter of '73, Julie envied no imaginable god. She was
  intoxicated with her overwhelming joy. She was aware, with every nerve in her
  body, that there was but one end to such love as this, and she who had been
  so proud, so reluctant, so disdainful of easy women, so innately chaste for
  all her high passions, now never hesitated. She knew she was his beyond the
  restraint of any honour, of any scruple.</p>

  <p>It was M. de Guibert who prolonged the sentimental stage of their
  affection. Julie had distracted him, roused him, finally made him love her.
  But she had neither absorbed him, nor dazzled him. He had a dozen other
  interests in his life and a perfectly clear head, both of which prevented him
  from being an ideal lover.</p>

  <p>Despite his vows to Julie, he kept up a very tender friendship with the
  patient Madame de Montsauge and a delicate coquetry with Madame de Boufflers,
  which he endeavoured to conceal; and he never relaxed for a moment his
  efforts for his own advancements, his eagerness to please, to fascinate, to
  win applause and fame. He was not content with drawing-room successes, but
  was inspired by a real desire for glory of a noble kind.</p>

  <p>If he had a little lost his head, his multitude of flatterers were to
  blame.</p>

  <p>'No man should have his portrait painted to whom posterity is not going to
  erect a bust,' he said, when sitting for his picture. And the remark did not
  sound vainglorious on the lips of the man praised by Voltaire and Frederic,
  and hailed as the coming saviour of his country by all the intellectuals of
  Paris.</p>

  <p>At present, Julie was scarcely disturbed by his overwhelming
  popularity.</p>

  <p>'Your talents condemn you to success,' was all she said. She did not mind
  the manner in which he was sought after, for it meant that she met him
  everywhere. Her friends combined to bring them together, for all the
  <i>salons</i> where she had queened it so long were now at his feet.</p>

  <p>M. de Vaines, M. Turgot, M. de Saint Chamans, M. de Crillon, M. de
  Chastellux, Madame Geoffrin, Madame Necker, Madame de Chatillon, even Madame
  de Boufflers and many others, continually invited both her and M. de Guibert
  to their houses. They could meet two&mdash;three times in the day at one of
  these hotels, and then on his return to the rue Taranne he would find a note
  from her telling him where he might meet her on the morrow.</p>

  <p>He had returned in October; by the time that the first chill winds of
  spring had lifted the winter fogs and mists from Paris, she had woven her
  charms completely round him. He knew the slumbering fires his touch could
  wake to madness: he knew that he did not desire any longer to resist this
  almost terrible love.</p>

  <p>He had tried to warn her&mdash;tried to tell her that he had nothing to
  offer her save, perhaps, perdition; tried to resist seizing the willing
  victim; tried to tell her that he had never meant more than friendship; but
  she, in her headlong passion, would have none of it. She called his scruples,
  his hesitations, coldnesses, as indeed they were, for he did not love her as
  she loved him, and never would.</p>

  <p>But the glory of her own emotion prevented her from observing this. She
  saw him yielding now and she was almost delirious with happiness.</p>

  <p>It was not very difficult for M. de Guibert, despite his secret
  misgivings, to shake the burden of the future off his shoulders: his healthy
  good humour saw no tragedy in the situation.</p>

  <p>Any affair with a woman was apt to be tiresome; he could only hope this
  would be no more tiresome than others. In any case, his marriage in the near
  future must end everything, and he reflected that a woman like Julie would
  easily find another lover. He did not give too much credence to the vows that
  she gave him, because he knew that they had been made to at least one man
  before, and he was not fine enough to understand the value of what she
  offered.</p>

  <p>Indeed, he was both too occupied and too self-absorbed to endeavour to
  understand her at all.</p>

  <p>At best, she was but one flower amid the laurel leaves with which he meant
  to crown himself; at worst, but an encumbrance to be flung off and forgotten;
  for, being neither sensitive nor morbid, M. de Guibert was not troubled by
  either regrets or remorse, nor did he ever mean to be.</p>

  <p>Julie had been happy before, never as happy as this. Even in the first
  days of her doomed affection for M. de Mora, she had not known this rapture,
  though she had been loved with a far nobler, more whole-hearted love: though
  her heart had beat in unison with M. de Mora in a way that it never could
  with M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>The familiar apartment that had begun to look so dreary to her
  disconsolate eyes, now appeared like an enchanted palace. The bleak spring
  days were hyacinth-scented to her, even here in the narrow streets of the
  city; the nights were full of vision and of wonder. The warm happiness of her
  love perfumed her life; her moods, her tempers, disappeared: she was sweet
  and gentle with all; she bewitched even those who had least admired her
  before.</p>

  <p>Her women friends&mdash;Madame Geoffrin and Madame de
  Chatillon&mdash;thought that the change in her was due to some assurance that
  her marriage with M. de Mora could be accomplished; every one knew that his
  return was spoken of.</p>

  <p>Julie, in her rainbow paradise, where the fairy colours were already
  charged with the radiancy of tears, gave no heed to what they thought.</p>

  <p>On a pale day in February she sent him the shortest note of their
  correspondence. She headed it: '<i>Every instant of my life</i>,' and the one
  sentence ran like liquid fire:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">'I love you, I suffer, and I wait for you.'</p><br>

  <p>He came: she had people with her and they could not speak alone. She asked
  him to go with her to the opera that night&mdash;a friend had lent her a box,
  and they had often been there before to listen to the voluptuous music of
  Gluck that so enthralled Julie's exquisite senses. Those hours had been magic
  for her. To-night they would be alone&mdash;he said he wished her to come
  alone. In his voice was that note&mdash;in his eyes that look, she had been
  waiting for. At last he was wholly hers, ah, surely...At last he loved her as
  she loved him. With a still look she said she would come alone. M. D'Alembert
  saw her depart with neither envy nor jealousy, only with a touching pleasure
  in her gaiety. She wore a new gown. D'Alembert had been rather bewildered by
  the number of new gowns that she had been having lately. When he had ventured
  to say that her income would not stand this extravagance, she had answered
  him with so radiant a smile that he was silent. To-night she was gorgeous in
  a lilac silk, flounced with filet lace and caught with little clusters of
  gold roses, and a huge wrap of white quilted silk. A gold ribbon was round
  her throat, a gold flower in her powdered hair. Her face looked lovely in its
  delicate glow. She was like the Julie of ten years ago who had captured all
  hearts in the Convent Saint-Joseph&mdash;a creature of such enduring charm
  that the faithful heart of the man who looked at her was thrilled to think
  that he was permitted to adore her. He did not go out that evening, but sat
  with her dog, her paroquet, her books, dreaming those loveless dreams of his.
  This dear room was so redolent of her presence that it did not seem to him
  that he was alone. He looked tenderly at her distaff, her work-bag of
  pink-shot taffeta, the bowl of jasmine she had arranged, her pictures, the
  alabaster bird she was so fond of&mdash;. all the little details of her home
  life.</p>

  <p>The little philosopher dared to imagine what it would have meant if he had
  married her, if the same tragedy of poverty and unhappy birth had not cursed
  them both, if each had not been nameless outcasts from their class...Ah well!
  such foolish dreams. Was it not happiness to be near her, to serve her and to
  love her?</p>

  <p>Hugging this comfort to his heart, he waited her return&mdash;a homely
  little figure in the low <i>bergère</i> by the great fire, with a book on his
  knee and the dog at his feet.</p>

  <p>He had his dinner alone. Afterwards M. de Vaines and M. de la Harpe came
  and went, and again he was alone, waiting Julie's return. She was late, later
  than she had ever been before. M. D'Alembert blinked in mild surprise at the
  clock on the mantelpiece; he sent his valet to bed, and began to doze a
  little himself over the fire he had kept so carefully mended.</p>

  <p>At last she came, entered silently the candle-lit room, and paused at the
  sight of M. D'Alembert. He had an instant impression that a stranger stood
  before him.</p>

  <p>'What is the matter?' he asked instinctively, starting up.</p>

  <p>Julie did not answer. She came to the other side of the fireplace. She did
  not unfasten her mantle, or unwind the lace scarf that was round her
  head.</p>

  <p>'Are you ill?' asked D'Alembert, anxiously stirred by he knew not what
  fears.</p>

  <p>'Ill?' she repeated. He thought her voice quite changed.</p>

  <p>'You look as if you had a fever,' he said.</p>

  <p>In truth, her face in the folds of the lace shawl had a glow that was not
  like the glow of health.</p>

  <p>At his words she glanced curiously at herself in the gilt mirror, and drew
  the mantle closer under her chin. 'Why, I am very well,' she said.</p>

  <p>'The opera was good? What was it?'</p>

  <p>The answer came after a second's hesitation: '<i>Le Devin du
  Village</i>.'</p>

  <p>'Ah! you were always fond of it&mdash;'tis a pretty thing. But you are
  late.'</p>

  <p>'I know. We remained to talk.'</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert smiled placidly. He saw Julie with her usual crowd of
  friends in the little amber-and-silver brocade <i>salon</i> behind the box,
  with its rosy lights and low couches, and he was glad that she had been
  gay.</p>

  <p>'Tell Madame Saint-Martin to go to bed,' said Julie suddenly.</p>

  <p>'But do you not want her?'</p>

  <p>'No. Please do this for me.'</p>

  <p>He left her to go upstairs and knock at the door of the room where the
  chamber-woman waited.</p>

  <p>Julie, as soon as she was alone, glanced swiftly round the room, with eyes
  that seemed to gaze from another world. How different everything looked...it
  would never look the same again.</p>

  <p>'What is the date?' she asked D'Alembert when he returned.</p>

  <p>'February the tenth.'</p>

  <p>Julie smiled at him vaguely. He came to take her mantle, but she stepped
  back.</p>

  <p>'No, I am cold.'</p>

  <p>She paused, as if she had difficulty in concentrating on what she
  said.</p>

  <p>He waited patiently her humour and her will; he thought perhaps that she
  wanted to stay and talk. Abruptly she spoke,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'The music goes to my head&mdash;it leaves me giddy. I must sleep now.
  Good-night&mdash;good-night.'</p>

  <p>She watched while he put the candles out and covered the fire. She gave
  him good-night again in a faint, absorbed voice. She took the brass
  candlestick he gave her, and went into her chilly, empty bedroom.</p>

  <p>Her little, solitary flame showed her the damask bed prepared, the muslin
  bed-gown, the slippers ready&mdash;all so familiar yet so strange, like home
  revisited after a lifetime's absence.</p>

  <p>She set down her candle; she unwound the lace from her head. Her locks
  fell in disorder. She unclasped her mantle and let it slip to the floor.</p>

  <p>The gold flower had gone from her hair, the gold ribbon from her neck. She
  wore no gloves and carried no fan.</p>

  <p>Holding out her bare arms, she stared at them curiously, as if she
  expected to see them marked; she lifted up her skirt and looked at one of the
  flounces that was torn; she put her fingers slowly to her cheeks, as if she
  expected their contours to have changed&mdash;all this in a dazed, stealthy
  sort of way. Then, like a flower bursting its sheath, some flame of feeling
  penetrated her stillness. She fell to her knees before one of the red chairs
  and clasped her hands against her face.</p>

  <p>She had accepted her fate&mdash;there were not two ways, no two issues
  open to her now. She no longer belonged to herself: she had nothing more to
  give.</p>

  <p>There was grandeur in the knowledge. She regretted nothing. Triumph, not
  fear, caused her to shudder; she was rapt not with terror, but with glory.
  This quiet room, lit by the solitary little candle, scarcely was real to her.
  It seemed as if she was still in the pale little brocade chamber behind the
  box with Jacques de Guibert, the swelling melodies of the opera in her
  ears.</p>

  <p>'Oh, my love, my love!' she whispered.</p>

  <p>No thought came to spoil her ecstasy. She did not think: 'I am now only to
  him what many other women have been,' but: 'He is now to me what no other man
  ever was.'</p>

  <p>Exalted, she remained on her knees before the splendour of her own vision,
  shivering with bliss, while the lifeless light of dawn crept between the red
  curtains, and the unheeded candle guttered in a winding-sheet round the
  gleaming brass.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <p class="first">In the town of Bordeaux, the twenty-third day of May of that
  year '74, a sad party of travellers arrived and put up at the first inn
  within the gates, one of their number being in a state in which it was
  impossible for him to travel farther.</p>

  <p>This haggard and fainting being, whose terrible look of illness excited
  the compassion, curiosity, and horror of the people of the inn, was the once
  brilliant, admired, flattered Jose de Pignatelli Gonzaga, Marquis de Mora,
  Gentleman of the Bedchamber to his Catholic Majesty and General in the
  Spanish army. In early February he had had, by a ghastly coincidence, a
  serious relapse; he had struggled up from this overthrow of his body to
  bitter perplexities of soul. M. D'Alembert's and M. Lorry's letters arrived
  urging him to return to Paris, but it was not these that had impelled him to
  take this desperate journey. A creeping doubt of Julie's fidelity had touched
  his heart; her letters, wild, agonised, often incoherent or delirious,
  betrayed the tumult of her soul; he felt that she was, for some mysterious
  reason, estranged from him. The absence of over two years had made no
  difference to his deep and noble love. To regain his health, to accomplish
  his marriage, to return to Julie&mdash;all for her sake&mdash;these had been
  the sole objects of his tortured life since he had come back to Madrid.</p>

  <p>To satisfy himself as to her faith, to save her if need be from herself,
  to protect her and claim her, he had overcome the languor of his failing
  body, he had dragged himself away from his family and friends, his home and
  his country, and started on the long journey to Paris. He was accompanied by
  M. Navarro and two servants, and had been travelling since the third of
  May.</p>

  <p>At first his health had not appeared to suffer; by slow stages he had
  drawn nearer his goal; a sense of exultation had begun to fill his heart.</p>

  <p>'I have that in me which will repay you for all that I have made you
  suffer,' he wrote to Julie from one of his stages. A few hours later a
  violent bleeding from the lungs laid him prostrate, and the rest of the
  journey was one long, anguished struggle with his fatal illness.</p>

  <p>After another ten days of agony, somehow they got him as far as Bordeaux;
  he had to be carried from the coach to his chamber. His first act was to take
  out his tablets and write to Julie&mdash;'From Bordeaux, on arriving May
  23rd, 1774, and nearly dead,' he headed his letter.</p>

  <p>But he set his teeth against his fate.</p>

  <p>'It is impossible that I shall <i>not</i> see her,' he said. He would not
  take off his travelling clothes. 'I shall start again in the morning.'</p>

  <p>In the poor inn bedroom, among strangers, the young man faced the spectre
  that had dogged his steps so long. He was not yet thirty, he had everything
  to make life desirable, he was animated by one great passion, one
  overwhelming desire; with the whole strength of his ardent soul he fought
  against his failing body. His resistance had already been marvellous. M.
  Navarro had not believed that he would get as far as Bordeaux.</p>

  <p>He lay on the bed in the upper chamber to which they had carried him, the
  windows set open on the May evening, his cravat untied, his great eyes
  staring across the room. He was so cold that they had covered him with
  blankets; he was so emaciated that these lay smooth over his body,
  undisturbed by the fleshless limbs. If the woman whom he worshipped could
  have seen him now, probably she would not have recognised him, so changed
  were his characteristics.</p>

  <p>The bony structure of his face showed prominently, the hawk-like nose was
  sharp and pinched, the once full lips dragged and thin, his complexion clay
  colour, even his eyes had a strange, staring look that altered them; his hair
  was as gray as if powdered and clung damp with sweat to his hollow temples,
  across which the veins showed knotted and sluggish.</p>

  <p>The sound of his breathing filled the room, every few minutes a violent
  and useless cough shook him; he lay on the right side as he had done for the
  past year; to turn on the other caused him choking agony.</p>

  <p>M. Navarro, a reserved, intelligent, capable Spaniard, sat by the
  fireplace; despite the chilliness of the spring evening there was no fire,
  the smoke being intolerable to M. de Mora's ruined lungs.</p>

  <p>M. Navarro was depressed by his surroundings&mdash;the plaster walls, the
  uncarpeted floor, the rough bed, table and chairs, the foreign atmosphere. He
  did not care to look at the man on the bed whose grim, haunted, and staring
  eyes, with their look of bitter defiance, he knew were gazing across at him
  in an agony of challenge and question.</p>

  <p>It was the sick man who broke the silence. 'Tell me,' he said, in a
  hoarse, rattling whisper, 'that I shall be able to travel to-morrow
  early.'</p>

  <p>M. Navarro rose slowly and crossed to the bed; he took one of M. de Mora's
  hands; it was cold, damp, bluish about the nails. The doctor could hardly
  find the pulse; he bent forward and listened to the awful sound of the
  labouring breath tearing through the broken lungs.</p>

  <p>'A few days' repose, M. le Marquis,' he said quietly, 'would strengthen
  you.'</p>

  <p>The dark eyes, with their unnatural stare, fixed the speaker with a
  dreadful glance. 'I must get to Paris,' whispered M. de Mora. 'Ah, why not?
  She wants me, you know, doctor, everything will be all right when I am in
  Paris.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, ah, yes&mdash;but a little delay that would benefit you.
  Mademoiselle de Lespinasse would understand.'</p>

  <p>The wheezing whisper went on unheeding: 'Doctor, she is expecting me.'</p>

  <p>A sudden cough tore him; he made a convulsive struggle for air; the doctor
  dragged him into a sitting posture; he threw up pale blood that ran over his
  clothes, the bed, and the doctor's hands. M. Navarro called the servants.</p>

  <p>They chafed his wrists, moistened his temples with brandy, wiped away the
  hideous stains, laid him back on his pillows.</p>

  <p>He muttered 'Julie,' between his gasping breaths, and lay immobile.</p>

  <p>The doctor ascertained that he was still living and crept away with the
  two servants.</p>

  <p>'Señor,' whispered one, 'will the Marquis get to Paris?'</p>

  <p>M. Navarro, rather pale, looked at him quietly.</p>

  <p>'My friend,' he answered gravely, 'your master is already in the
  agony.'</p>

  <p>'Eh, <i>Dios!</i>' cried the man under his breath.</p>

  <p>'He was dying,' added the doctor, 'when he left Madrid&mdash;the whole
  journey has been a madness&mdash;and a miracle.'</p>

  <p>Tears filled the servant's eyes.</p>

  <p>'If it had not been for this accursed Frenchwoman,' he muttered, 'M. de
  Mora might at least have died at home with his family.'</p>

  <p>The doctor slightly lifted his shoulders. He had so long known this case
  to be hopeless that he had lost professional interest in it; from the first
  he had been aware that the Marquis would certainly die on one of the stages
  of the journey. He was only amazed that his patient should have lasted till
  Bordeaux.</p>

  <p>As the dreary hours wore on, the room was prepared for the night, a small
  lamp lit, cordials, medicines, glasses, flasks, arranged on the little table
  by the bed. The curtains were left drawn and the windows unlatched on the
  moon-filled night.</p>

  <p>The doctor left the watch to the valets and went downstairs to his
  supper.</p>

  <p>He wondered, as he sat over his sombre meal, what this woman was like for
  whose sake a dying man had so forced his strength; he knew that she was not
  young nor fair.</p>

  <p>M. Navarro remembered the beautiful dancer over whom M. de Mora had
  quarrelled in his youth with M. de Villa Hermosa and the gorgeous Duchesse de
  Huescar who had later fascinated him. Who was this woman who could maintain
  such an empire over a heart that had so soon become indifferent to these two
  brilliant creatures?</p>

  <p>M. Navarro knew, as only a doctor or a confessor could, the soul of the
  man dying upstairs; knew how absolutely it was dominated by one thought, that
  of Julie de Lespinasse: one desire, that to return to her: one emotion, love
  of her. Even last autumn when his mother had died, his real and passionate
  grief had been assuaged by the remembrance of his love waiting for him in
  Paris.</p>

  <p>'He would have married her,' thought the doctor, with all a Spaniard's
  pride. 'Of course she tried for it&mdash;a Fuentès&mdash;and she an astute,
  French coquette. I expect she has played him false and he knows it&mdash;the
  heir of the Fuentès and that woman!'</p>

  <p>The doctor finished his wine and wiped his lips. He considered that the
  premature end of M. de Mora was perhaps fortunate in so far as it saved him
  from the folly of marriage with this penniless, foreign adventuress, basely
  born and middle-aged and with reputation gravely damaged, in the eyes of
  people like M. Navarro, by her connection with M. D'Alembert. He wondered,
  rather cynically, what she was doing now, and what she would do when she
  received this news. He made no doubt at all that she had already put some one
  in M. de Mora's place. Her letters, that the frenzied Marquis had babbled
  about in his delirium, were sufficient, the doctor thought, to prove this.
  She must, considered M. Navarro, have been very sure that he would never
  return to have flung away this chance of marriage. Of course she saw he was
  doomed when he left Paris.</p>

  <p>A slight smile curved his lips as he pictured the scene there would have
  been if M. de Mora <i>had</i> reached the rue Saint-Dominique...Ah, well!
  these speculations were useless. The hastening lover would never leave
  Bordeaux.</p>

  <p>The doctor passed for a moment into the fresh night air before commencing
  his long and painful night vigil.</p>

  <p>There were a great many people about: the King of France was lately dead,
  Madame du Barry had fled...</p>

  <p>Great things were expected from the new monarch; it was whispered that men
  like Turgot and Necker, the friends of the people, would come into power;
  every one hoped some alleviation of his private hardships from the ending of
  the reign of Madame du Barry and her minions; it was supposed that the Duc de
  Choiseul would return from his banishment at Chanteloup. The air was full of
  rumours, mostly of cheerful augury. M. Navarro gathered that the whole state
  of France was so deplorable, perilous and bankrupt, that men were clutching
  at any shadow of hope with desperate hands.</p>

  <p>He recalled that Julie de Lespinasse was the Muse and goddess of the party
  now coming into power; in an age of reason and liberty, during the triumph of
  the philosophers and Encyclopaedists, Julie de Lespinasse would be more
  famous than she had ever been; probably, thought M. Navarro, she would not
  have time to mourn greatly M. de Mora.</p>

  <p>With this thought in his mind, he went upstairs to the sick chamber and
  dismissed the two distressed servants to take some rest. M. de Mora's
  shivering fit had now passed into a high fever. He had flung off all the
  bedclothes and lay on his back with his arms flung out; his face glistened
  with sweat, but his lips were dry and strained back from his large, white,
  blood-stained teeth; the red veins in his eyes stood out clearly, his lids
  were turned back and the eyeballs were protruding from their sockets. His
  breathing racked his whole body; the deep cough shook him every few minutes.
  His cravat was flung aside, and the muscles of his throat showed labouring
  either side of a hollow above his collar-bone.</p>

  <p>He could not move his head, but he turned his terrible eyes towards the
  doctor.</p>

  <p>M. Navarro approached him and bent down above the bed.</p>

  <p>'This&mdash;is nothing serious?' he whispered.</p>

  <p>'Nothing; all you need is rest,' replied the doctor cheerfully. He tried
  gently to wipe the sick man's face; but M. de Mora made a movement for him to
  desist.</p>

  <p>'You would not deceive me?' he added in his hoarse mutter. 'There is no
  danger? I feel as if I were breaking in pieces.'</p>

  <p>'No danger at all, M. le Marquis,' said M. Navarro, taking up the limp,
  burning hand. 'The pulse is excellent, the breathing good.'</p>

  <p>'I shall be able to journey to-morrow?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly.'</p>

  <p>'Lift me&mdash;a little.'</p>

  <p>The doctor turned him on his side. He was so weak that even this effort
  nearly caused him to faint. He shivered and shuddered and gazed across the
  room with that awful look in which astonishment and reproach were mingled
  with an absorbed anger. His mind began to wander.</p>

  <p>'Is it possible that I shall never realise any of my dreams?' he said.
  Then: 'Who are these people who all cry, "Fool! fool! fool!?" If I had more
  money we might get married.'</p>

  <p>He lifted his head to cough, dropped it again, and blood trickled out of
  his mouth on to the handkerchief that the doctor had tucked under his face.
  He looked at this, and then up at the doctor.</p>

  <p>'I must get strong,' he whispered. 'She&mdash;will find me too much
  changed.'</p>

  <p>Disgust at the long nausea of the illness against which he had so
  desperately fought, shook him.</p>

  <p>'Give me something to make me strong,' he said. 'Food&mdash;why are you
  keeping me without food?'</p>

  <p>Then he lay silent with his eyes half-closed, as if insensible.</p>

  <p>The doctor went softly away and returned with two eggs in brandy; but the
  sick man could not take them, nor even lift his head again.</p>

  <p>His distorted face now showed purple patches under the eyes where the
  congested blood burnt; every breath he had to fight for, yet even now the
  ardent spirit was struggling against the last lethargy. When he spoke again
  his mind was quite clear, if bewildered.</p>

  <p>'I ought to be with her in a few days,' he said. He looked at his hands,
  which were swollen. 'Ah! I am getting stronger, doctor,' he muttered. 'Not
  strong, but&mdash;well, they are not so thin, my hands.'</p>

  <p>Now he seemed to fall asleep.</p>

  <p>One of the servants came tiptoeing to the door: what about fetching a
  priest?</p>

  <p>The doctor was perfectly aware of the opinions of M. de Mora, but an old
  superstition stirred again in his heart. He was not a religious man himself,
  but he was aware that the opinions of the Encyclopaedists did not, somehow,
  seem so important in the face of death.</p>

  <p>He hesitated, while the man insisted. Should the heir of Fuentès go to
  damnation out of respect to the doctrines of this shameless Frenchwoman? he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>'But he does not know that he is dying,' returned M. Navarro. 'He still
  thinks that he will reach, Paris. But in case he should ask for a priest,
  have one in readiness. They tell me that the parish church is Notre-Dame de
  Puy Paulin.'</p>

  <p>With that he gently closed the door and returned to his patient's
  bedside.</p>

  <p>M. de Mora lay in the same position. His ghastly face, seen in the dim
  light of the night-lamp, already glistened with the death damps; but his eyes
  were open and the look in them showed that the soul still struggled fiercely.
  His resistance had been so unnaturally prolonged that the doctor was struck
  by a sense of horror as if he were a spectator of something superhuman.</p>

  <p>He withdrew the stained handkerchief from under M. de Mora's cheek and
  placed a fresh one. He noticed that the fever had fallen a little and that
  the dying man appeared in full possession of his faculties.</p>

  <p>'Doctor,' he whispered, every word like a rough sob between his broken
  breaths, 'this is the end, is it not?'</p>

  <p>'Ah, M. le Marquis, we must hope. You make a marvellous resistance; but if
  you would see a priest&mdash;as a mere act of precaution.'</p>

  <p>If M. de Mora heard he paid no attention. All his failing forces were
  concentrated, with a supreme effort, on one object.</p>

  <p>'I would write&mdash;to Mademoiselle de Lespinasse,' he murmured, 'while I
  have the strength.'</p>

  <p>The doctor was startled into a protest. The sick man's eyes were fixed on
  him in a dreadful stare.</p>

  <p>'I cannot&mdash;talk...get me the things,' he gasped.</p>

  <p>A cough that brought blood stopped him. He made a vague gesture; his eyes
  shone with imperious command.</p>

  <p>The doctor hastened to unstrap one of the portmanteaux on the floor, and
  took out a writing-desk in black morocco, unlocked it and put it before M. de
  Mora.</p>

  <p>The cherished letters of Julie de Lespinasse fell out on to the bed.</p>

  <p>M. Navarro lifted the Marquis up, propped him with cushions, and put a
  pencil into his right hand.</p>

  <p>M. de Mora remained motionless a moment; then with jerky and uncontrolled
  movements began to write.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">'I was coming to you...but I must die. Ah, cruel destiny!
  But you have loved me; that thought sweetens even this&mdash;I die for
  you...'</p>

  <p>The paper fluttered from his hand. He could do no more. The doctor caught
  him as he fell back on the pillows.</p>

  <p>He could no longer speak, but he held out his hand and gazed at two rings
  there, and then up at the doctor.</p>

  <p>M. de Navarro knew that one of those rings was composed of a tress of the
  hair of Julie de Lespinasse, and that the other was one that she had given
  him in the early days of their love&mdash;a gold band engraved with the
  motto: '<i>Tout passe hormis l'amour.</i>'</p>

  <p>'You want them sent to Mademoiselle de Lespinasse?' asked the doctor.</p>

  <p>A faint contraction like the distortion of a smile passed over his swollen
  face. He lay still staring across the room.</p>

  <p>The doctor sealed and addressed the unfinished lines to Mademoiselle de
  Lespinasse: he intended to send them: if this woman had a conscience he meant
  to hurt her. He felt that he hated her as he considered the place and the
  manner in which she had caused M. de Mora to die.</p>

  <p>Then he returned to his post to watch through the long struggle, the
  protracted agony that could have but one end: to listen to the senseless
  mutterings of the dying man as he fought with a delirium through which one
  name sounded again and again: 'Julie&mdash;Julie&mdash;Julie de
  Lespinasse.'</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

  <p class="first">The news of her lover's intended return, of the terrible
  state of his health, of the commencement of the fatal journey, reached a
  woman already in torture.</p>

  <p>Very brief for Julie de Lespinasse had been the vision and the splendour
  of passion; very short the glory of her supreme surrender; very soon over
  that intoxication of the soul that had swept away jealousy and made her
  indifferent even to Madame de Montsauge.</p>

  <p>In the first rapture she had believed that she was loved as she loved
  herself, with a sentiment of the same quality and strength. She had taken it
  for granted that the man at whose feet she had cast all she had, would give
  her everything in return. She would have considered it blasphemy to have
  doubted his fidelity.</p>

  <p>But the soft, luscious rind of the Dead Sea fruit soon withered in her
  hand, disclosing the ashes beneath. In a few weeks triumphant joy had given
  place to horror at him and amazement at herself. She saw that her love was
  neither understood, appreciated, nor perhaps wanted by M. de Guibert, that he
  was absorbed in other pursuits, interested in other women, and that to him,
  spoiled by easy conquests, this love, to her brilliant as life and terrible
  as death, was but an episode.</p>

  <p>This knowledge showed her her conduct in the most awful light: her
  unfaithfulness to the perfect lover who was giving such a tremendous proof of
  his tender constancy, seemed to her monstrous.</p>

  <p>The image of the dying man leaving his home to struggle back to Paris to
  save her from herself, haunted her with a terrible persistency. She could not
  imagine what would be more terrible&mdash;that he should die before seeing
  her, or that he should reach her only to learn a truth that would be his
  death-blow&mdash;the truth she had so carefully concealed from him, that he
  suspected and must discover once he was in her presence.</p>

  <p>During this month of May, when all Paris was absorbed by the change of
  monarchs and a thousand hopes and plans for the salvation of France, Julie
  remained shut in her chamber, overthrown with fright and horror.</p>

  <p>She had dosed her <i>salon</i> when M. de Guibert had become the sole
  point of interest in her life; but her friends had continued informally to
  gather round her. Now she would see none of them, not even Madame Geoffrin or
  Madame de Châtillon.</p>

  <p>She would not admit M. de Guibert into her presence. Not only were these
  hours sacred to M. de Mora, but she could not sufficiently disguise her agony
  to receive a man who neither understood nor sympathised with the cause of it.
  Alone with M. D'Alembert, himself in a state of the deepest distress, she
  awaited the news of her fate.</p>

  <p>Her one relief were the letters that she now wrote to M. Condorcet and M.
  Suard, her two confidants.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">'To-morrow's news will perhaps deliver me from life. This
  horrible thought will not leave me. The image of M. de Mora only appears to
  me under the aspect of death. There seems to me nothing more to do. You know
  what I mean, but you do not know all. No, there is no more calm, repose, to
  be hoped for...you will not blame me if I think no more of reason and
  moderation; if I would continue to live I must continue to submit to these
  virtues. But I assure you that I shall not remain more than a moment in this
  sad state called life. After this, see what I think and judge what I shall
  do!'</p><br>

  <p>In the same strain of despair she wrote to M. de Guibert:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">'I have a sense of terror that unsettles my reason. I await
  Wednesday, and it seems to me that death itself could not be sufficient
  remedy, for the loss I fear...It is beyond my strength to think that perhaps
  he whom I love and who loved me, will hear me no more and will come no more
  to my aid.'</p><br>

  <p>When she had heard that M. de Mora was leaving Madrid, the thought that
  she would have to tell him of her infidelity had frozen her soul. Now the
  knowledge that she would never meet him to tell him anything was infinitely
  worse. It seemed to her that her love for him had never been dead, only
  obscured by this frantic passion for another man which had seized her against
  her will. Her feeling for M. de Guibert now appeared to herself as one of
  hatred. When, during her anxious days of waiting, he forced himself into her
  presence, she turned on him as if he had been an enemy.</p>

  <p>'What are my misfortunes to you? What awful error have I not made? How I
  have been deceived and blinded! You have never been my friend! you never will
  be! <i>Mon Dieu</i> how is it that my mind could not restrain my heart?...I
  always read you...Yet in judging you I was still attracted by you. Leave me
  You understand nothing. With you, to love is but an accident of your
  age.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert, who was of a singularly patient disposition and so normal
  as to be insensible to many of the exquisite agonies of this highly-strung,
  nervous, passionate nature, went his way without much demur. It was an added
  pang to the wretched Julie to know that he was seeking consolation in the
  delicate coquetries of Madame de Boufflers and the placid affections of
  Madame de Montsauge. She almost succeeded in despising him. With her mind she
  really did hold him in contempt, and all her deep devotion was for M. de
  Mora. Her behaviour appeared to her in the light of a crime&mdash;a treason
  unspeakable. She abhorred herself and detested M. de Guibert; she only
  existed for the news from M. de Mora. Her friends, in particular her
  confidants, M. Condorcet and M. Suard, were alarmed at the intensity of her
  grief; they feared for her life or her reason, and were astonished at this
  affection which had endured so long and so intensely, little guessing the
  true cause for her intolerable anguish.</p>

  <p>On the second of June, the unfinished letter written in the Bordeaux inn
  was put into her hands.</p>

  <p>'I was coming to you, but I must die. Ah, cruel destiny But you, have
  loved me&mdash;that thought sweetens even this. I die for you...' Added to
  these broken lines, which showed some of the confusion of approaching and
  final anguish, was a brief note from M. Navarro, stating how M. le Marquis de
  Mora, after struggling in the agony for three days, had died in the inn at
  Bordeaux, after receiving the Sacraments, and had been buried the next day,
  with some pomp, at the church of Notre-Dame de Puy Paulin.</p>

  <p>The despair of Julie de Lespinasse at the news, rose to the supreme
  suffering of real tragedy. She was as exalted as she had been in the first
  days of her surrender to M. de Guibert. She had done with lamentations. She
  saw only one thing to do: to put into practice the project she wildly hinted
  at in her letter to M. Suard. She could no longer reason; at the same moment
  she found herself robbed of the love that had been the glory of her life, and
  disillusioned in the man for whose sake she had betrayed this perfect and
  noble affection. She had to endure the knowledge of her own falseness, and
  the bitter remorse of having troubled, by the confusion and coldness of her
  letters, the last days of the man who had lived only for her, of having, by
  allowing him to have had doubts of her, caused him to undertake the journey
  that had resulted in his death. She was stunned by a terrible sense of loss..
  This deep, tender, faithful love that had illumined her whole life; this
  loyal, strong, and passionate friend was gone, and she shivered in her
  loneliness. The love of M. de Guibert was a poor substitute.</p>

  <p>'If I could only have died yesterday,' she said to herself, 'if the first
  of June could have but fixed the term of my life.' Vaguely she recalled all
  the pains and miseries that she had ever endured&mdash;they seemed as nothing
  compared to this. She regarded M. D'Alembert with a new and remorseful
  tenderness; she watched his grief almost with envy. If she could have mourned
  so single-heartedly, she felt that she would have been happy.</p>

  <p>Her doors were closed to all corners. She wrote to M. Suard, her faithful
  confidant&mdash;'A moment has annihilated thirty-seven years of
  unhappiness!'&mdash;despatched the letter, sent M. D'Alembert to tell Madame
  Geoffrin the fatal news, dismissed the weeping Madame Saint-Martin, and
  closed herself into her chamber. She was so giddy that she could hardly
  stand, so overwrought that nothing seemed real to her but this one thing on
  which all her fainting energy was concentrated&mdash;death.</p>

  <p>It had been perfectly clear to her from the moment that the shock of the
  news of M. de Mora's relapse and proposed return had finally revealed to her
  the full meaning of what she had done, that if he died she must die, too. She
  did not contemplate suicide because it would serve any purpose, or because it
  would be any expiation of what she now regarded as her crime, but because her
  sufferings were so intense that she snatched at the only possible remedy. She
  turned to death as she had turned to the opiate, because she could not endure
  this acute torture of mind and body.</p>

  <p>Trembling and cold, she sat down in the red armchair in her bedchamber.
  Her head ached, and she was so weak that the room rocked before her eyes; all
  her limbs ached, and she sat in a reclining posture through sheer weakness.
  On the little table by the fire-place was the bottle of opium and a glass.
  She meant to take the poison, without further reflection, as soon as her hand
  was steady enough to pour it out.</p>

  <p>M. de Mora's letter had been brought to her when she was in bed, and she
  still wore her loose bedgown of white dimity, with a dressing-jacket of
  crimson-and-white striped muslin. Her hair hung in dark disorder over her
  thin shoulders; her face, untouched by powder, was of the ghastly sallowness
  of ill-health, her lips bloodless and her eyes swollen and dim. Of all her
  charm nothing remained but the grace of her figure and movement and a certain
  fineness of make and carriage that nothing could efface.</p>

  <p>She was past thinking or reasoning; but certain thoughts forced themselves
  on her stunned mind. Above all, amazement at herself...How could she have
  done it?...How could she? The magic and the enchantment gone like mists
  before the wind the thing showed stark and hideous.</p>

  <p>Not three months ago and she had touched the stars and walked in Paradise;
  all her blood had throbbed to an immortal melody; her spirit had known
  perfect ease and peace.</p>

  <p>Now, viewing it with the coldness of despair, she wondered at herself with
  a bitter wonder. What had been so beautiful, now appeared vulgar; what had
  seemed so wonderful, now seemed commonplace, ah! so commonplace.</p>

  <p>The episode had but added one more triumph to the record of a man already
  jaded with such conquests, and from her it had taken everything. She, so
  proud, so fastidious, so aloof in her sad story, her brilliant position, her
  great power of intellect, her great gift of charm, had been as easy as any of
  these women whom she had hitherto despised...And the man who had conquered
  her was merely the popular idol of the <i>salons</i> whom every silly woman
  was in love with&mdash;a man in every way inferior to the noble lover she had
  won and betrayed.</p>

  <p>'Ah! how I am fallen,' she muttered. Her head fell sideways against the
  back of the chair, and she stared with blurred vision at the window against
  which a light spring rain was drifting.</p>

  <p>Time and place no longer existed for Julie; the pleasant room seemed
  remote from the world and filled with a mortal cold.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">'He was buried the next day, with a certain pomp, in the
  Church of Nôtre-Dame de Puy Paulin.'</p><br>

  <p>This sentence seemed suddenly written on the void that was closing round
  her, shutting out familiar objects.</p>

  <p>She wondered what they had done with her rings...Had he been buried with
  them?...She saw him dead very dearly, rigid and still, with the grave-cloths
  about him, lying in the vault of that strange and foreign church. He had
  received the Viaticum, the doctor said. Had his ancient faith, then, returned
  at the supreme moment, or had the sacrament been forced on him when he could
  not resist?...If she believed the Christian faith it would give her a hope
  that she might see him again&mdash;a hope of redemption...'though your sins
  be as scarlet'...But she was a disciple of Voltaire, and no comfort of any
  creed lightened the darkness that encompassed her: the black abyss of utter
  annihilation was her one refuge.</p>

  <p>Spurred by a terror that M. D'Alembert would return and call her back to
  life, she dragged herself up and stretched out her hand for the opium-bottle.
  It took her a considerable effort to pour out the poison, her hand was so
  feeble; the sight of the pale liquid gave her a faint sensation of relief.
  Soon this intolerable anguish would really end.</p>

  <p>The thought gave her a little strength. She drained the bottle into the
  glass, which she was about to raise to her lips when the sound of some one
  struggling at her door caused her to start violently.</p>

  <p>So M. D'Alembert had returned&mdash;was alarmed. The thought that he could
  intrude on her agonies caused her to put the glass back and desperately fight
  for the strength to send him away. Twice she made an effort to speak and
  could not. The struggling at the door continued; it seemed as if the lock
  must give way. This impetuous strength did not seem that of M.
  D'Alembert.</p>

  <p>Julie quivered like one slowly coming back to life out of a trance.</p>

  <p>A beautiful masculine voice called to her:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Julie Julie! You must&mdash;you shall admit me!'</p>

  <p>She stared at the door; it was as if an angel had spoken to one in
  limbo.</p>

  <p>'Julie; I command you!' came the voice again, 'or I will force the
  lock.'</p>

  <p>New strength began to circulate in her veins. She was like one under a
  spell, and went and turned the key in the door.</p>

  <p>It was instantly flung open, and M. de Guibert stood before
  her&mdash;radiant, splendid, profoundly moved.</p>

  <p>'Julie, I have heard!' he said quickly. He entered, closed the door, and
  swiftly took her in his arms.</p>

  <p>'I said I would see no one,' said Julie dully; to her own ears the words
  tinkled like utter folly.</p>

  <p>'Do you think that lackeys could keep me from you?' he cried. He gazed at
  her dishevelled appearance; then saw the glass and bottle by the chair.
  '<i>Mon Dieu</i>! what is this?'</p>

  <p>'I must die,' answered Julie. 'Do not seek to prevent me.'</p>

  <p>He laughed. Never had he been more fond, more entirely hers. His embrace
  tightened round her frail figure, and he kissed her poor, distorted face.</p>

  <p>Julie gave a low cry of despair; she felt her resolution dwindling, the
  love of life returning, the ancient magic enslaving her. All her little
  thoughts of him vanquished. His presence was as wine and sun to her. As she
  lay on his breast she once again entered her paradise.</p>

  <p>'Do you then love me?' she asked desperately. 'Is it possible?'</p>

  <p>'I love you, Julie.'</p>

  <p>'But I must die, for I have killed the noblest of men&mdash;he who loved
  me&mdash;-'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert smiled indulgently. '<i>Mon ami</i>, I understand and pity
  your distress; but you have nothing to reproach yourself with. M. de Mora was
  dying when he last left Paris.'</p>

  <p>'Does that make my crime the less?'</p>

  <p>'He knew nothing of it.'</p>

  <p>'He guessed...my letters...Oh! I must die.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert gently placed her fainting weight in the red chair by the
  fireplace, took up the bottle of opium, went to the window, opened it, and
  cast the poison out into the rainy air.</p>

  <p>Impetuously he returned to Julie. 'Live, <i>mon ami</i>, live. There are
  others love you beside M. de Mora. You made him happy for many years. He is
  dead through no fault of yours&mdash;and life has much&mdash;has everything,
  to offer you.'</p>

  <p>Julie sat bowed before him, speechless through conflicting passions,
  endeavouring to struggle against this enchantment that was beginning to
  dazzle her into forgetting her anguish.</p>

  <p>'Look at me,' said M. de Guibert, bending over her. Reluctantly she raised
  her haggard eyes. Like life and youth and love personified, he was revealed
  to them&mdash;the antithesis of all the haunting horror that had been driving
  her to suicide.</p>

  <p>His sanity, his health, his strength, his calm, seemed to dwarf her
  tragedy. His fresh, charming face, that seemed incapable of expressing either
  fear or anguish, his light, careless clothes, his shapely, virile hands, his
  musical and changeable voice, his very presence made the thought of death and
  agony seem grotesque...</p>

  <p>'Oh, <i>grand Dieu</i>!' she murmured, 'if we lived in the days of
  wizardry, I should say that you bewitched me!'</p>

  <p>'Is not love an enchantment, Julie?'</p>

  <p>'But I dare not love you...I do not like you...I do not know what you do
  to me...But now I hated you!...I have been loved by one so noble.'...</p>

  <p>'But did he teach you what love means, Julie, or did I?'</p>

  <p>She hid her face in her thin hands.</p>

  <p>'Go,' she muttered. 'You offer me a worse poison than that you have cast
  away...Leave me.'</p>

  <p>'Leave you to mourn a shadow! You have been mine since I first met
  you.'</p>

  <p>She made an agonised effort to resist him; she rose and caught hold of the
  metal mantelpiece. She looked a strange, broken figure in her crumpled white
  dress and hanging dark hair.</p>

  <p>'What am I become,' she asked bitterly, 'that in this moment I can even
  listen to you?'</p>

  <p>'Julie, you cannot deny me. Why are you afraid of love? Do you not see
  that it is like fire that purifies all it touches?'</p>

  <p>'And consumes,' said Julie, with a terrible smile, 'and consumes. You
  condemn me to life but to kill me slowly and less mercifully.'</p>

  <p>For answer, he took and kissed her hands with great tenderness, drawing
  her gradually towards him; all his generosity and chivalry, all his love for
  her were fully roused by her suffering. She had always attracted him when her
  flame-like emotions were laid bare, and a certain unconscious jealousy of the
  dead man caused him to exert all his power to recapture her entire heart.</p>

  <p>'Some men would not be so gentle with this grief of yours,' he said.</p>

  <p>At these words, which reminded her that she belonged to him, Julie
  quivered. Her desperate heart read in them the assurance that he truly loved
  her with a love strong enough indeed to snatch her from the arms of death.
  She roused from the lethargy of her anguish into one of those movements of
  unrestrained passion that always took him with her to fierce heights of
  rapture.</p>

  <p>'My fate was pronounced last February,' she cried, 'to love you or to die!
  If you force me to live, you must love me! love me! love me!'</p>

  <p>He caught her close in his arms.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

  <p class="first">'You have condemned me to live; you have bound and chained
  me to life,' Julie de Lespinasse said frequently to the man who had saved her
  from suicide, and it was true that her existence during the months following
  the death of M. de Mora was one long punishment.</p>

  <p>The thing that kept her alive&mdash;her fatal passion for Jacques de
  Guibert, was also her most acute torture. He was literally all she had in the
  world, and she felt that only his complete devotion could reconcile her to
  drawing out her miserable existence. She had given all, and she wanted all.
  'Live and love me! Live and I will love you!' he had urged; and on those
  terms she had resisted the temptation to die.</p>

  <p>But again she had been disillusionised. Once he had assured himself that
  she intended nothing desperate, M. de Guibert began again to prove himself an
  indifferent lover; not that he was really wishful to neglect her, but because
  he was distracted by a thousand other interests, and because his equable,
  happy temperament could not remotely comprehend the tragedy of this stormy,
  sensitive, nervous, fine nature that had been so cruelly stricken and so
  utterly humiliated. He was young; he was attractive; he was ambitious; he had
  all Paris at his feet; he was overwhelmed by the attentions of charming
  women. It was not possible that his thoughts should be entirely and always
  with Julie de Lespinasse unless she had inspired him with a passion equal to
  that she had roused in M. de Mora.</p>

  <p>It was her worst suffering to notice that this was not so; to be aware
  that he was incapable of any head-long abandonment to any one
  emotion&mdash;that he would never love her as she had been loved.</p>

  <p>She bitterly contrasted his behaviour with that of M. de Mora, who had
  thought only of her, who had written to her twice a day when he was being
  fêted and caressed at Fontainbleau; who had remained absolutely faithful to
  her despite the seductions of women like the Duchesse de Huescar and the
  fierce opposition of his family and friends; who had been prepared to marry
  her regardless of the difference in their positions and her unconventional
  life; who had been absorbed in her until the very moment of that death which
  he met in coming to her rescue.</p>

  <p>This disappointment in what she had paid so high a price for, this aching
  remorse for what she had lost, rendered Julie stormy, difficult, jealous,
  suspicious, capricious to the last degree.</p>

  <p>She spied on M. de Guibert's movements. Madame de Montsauge was her
  perpetual torment. She, at the least neglect or coldness or slight that she
  fancied, accused her lover of heartless infidelity, and added hot reproaches
  as to his being the cause of her misery.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert endured these scenes with patience; he was rather maladroit
  with women, and had always had to pay the penalty in this kind of discomfort;
  besides, he had many consolations.</p>

  <p>But though he might anger Julie to the soul, wound her to the quick,
  though she might understand him, weigh him, despise him, she never ceased to
  adore him with her entire being.</p>

  <p>'All these contradictions of my unhappy heart,' she wrote to him, 'can be
  explained in three words; "I love you."'</p>

  <p>She craved for his society with feverish eagerness; when he was not with
  her she wrote to him; she took a passionate interest in all that appertained
  to him&mdash;his career, his writing, his travels, his soldiering. The rest
  of the world did not exist for her. Since she had closed her saws to her
  friends she had appeared a changed being; even with Madame Geoffrin, with
  Condorcet, with Suard, she was silent and distraite.</p>

  <p>With M. D'Alembert she preserved a certain tenderness because of his
  sincere grief for M. de Mora: the Comte de Fuentès had asked him to write a
  eulogy on his son; M. de Villa Hermosa had written affectionately; his wife
  had sent Julie the ring of hair found on the dead man's finger.</p>

  <p>Julie received these attentions with bitter irony; but the little
  philosopher was pleased, and promised to write a tribute to M. de Mora, whom
  he himself described 'as the most perfect creature I have ever known.' He
  continued to act as Julie's secretary, man of business, if need be, lackey
  and servant. He would always hasten back from the Academy to see what service
  he could render in the rue Saint-Dominique Julie needed many services now.
  The health that had come with the brief radiancy of her happiness, had gone;
  the shock of the news of M. de Mora's death had completely undermined her
  strength. Her physical sufferings were frightful, and excused and explained
  in the eyes of all her moods, whims, melancholy, and caprices.</p>

  <p>Her cough had returned with violence; insomnia, headaches, pain and
  sickness, constant fits of fever and delirium, convulsions followed by
  fainting fits made her life a penance. She got through the days by the aid of
  enormous doses of opium, and continual hot baths, both of which left her
  weaker and more sensitive to pain than before.</p>

  <p>When she could not have the company of M. de Guibert she dragged herself
  out to seek distraction among her old resorts. The society she frequented was
  full of life and movement, hopes and plans. Everything was expected from a
  young king. It was said that M. Necker and M. Turgot, both old friends of
  Julie would come into power. All this did not now remotely interest the woman
  who had for so long been the 'Muse of the Encyclopaedia.' She might have been
  a power among the most powerful men of the day; instead, she withdrew more
  and more from the society she had once so adorned and dominated, and her
  position fell from her into the hands of more ambitious women. This, too, she
  had sacrificed to her impetuous passion for Jacques de Guibert.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">'You have no need to be loved,' she wrote to him
  desperately. 'Confidence, tenderness, self-forgetfulness, all that a tender
  and passionate soul appreciates are unknown to you. And I have dared to
  accuse other people of lack of discernment, of not knowing men I, who so
  utterly deceived myself! You know not half the power you have over me; you
  know not what you have to overcome every time I see you. You do not realise
  the sacrifices I make for you&mdash;you do not know how I renounce myself to
  become yours. I say to you as Phèdre said: "<i>Il fallait bien souvent me
  priver de mes larmes</i>." Yes, <i>mon ami</i>, for your sake I deprive
  myself of all that is dear to me. I cannot talk to you either of my regrets
  nor of my memories; and what is still more cruel, I cannot let you see more
  than a half of the emotion with which you fill my heart, and I must control
  the passion that you excite in my soul. Incessantly I say to myself: "He
  could not reply; he could not understand, and I should die of grief."</p>

  <p class="letter">'Conceive, <i>mon ami</i>, the species of torture to which
  I am subjected. I am remorseful for that which I give you and regretful for
  that which I dare not give you. I abandon myself to you and do not satisfy my
  love. In ceding to you I combat myself. Ha! do you understand me&mdash;that
  which I feel and that which you make me suffer? When you turn to me it is
  merely the sensibility, the compassion of the moment. I know not why I write
  thus to you, <i>mon ami</i>. I am sure that I shall not find consolation in
  your heart, which is empty of tenderness and sentiment. You have only one
  means to deliver me from my suffering, and that is to intoxicate me, and this
  remedy is the greatest of my tortures.'</p><br>

  <p>Julie wrote these lines in bitter self-contempt, knowing now only too well
  that his attraction for her was purely physical, his charm entirely of the
  senses. When she was away from him she could analyse him, despise him...When
  she was in his presence, when he kissed her, she knew nothing save that she
  loved him with an overwhelming love.</p>

  <p>It was this long struggle between the mind and the body, this combat
  between the flesh and the spirit, that rendered her days a weary agony.</p>

  <p>It was a few weeks after the death of M. de Mora that M. de Guibert came
  one evening unexpectedly to the rue Saint-Dominique. Julie was due to dine
  with Madame de Chatillon, in whose tender friendship she was beginning to
  find a refuge in her distress, but she instantly sent a lackey to say that
  she could not come.</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert was with Madame Geoffrin: the lovers had the little crimson
  <i>salon</i> to themselves. M. de Guibert, in prune-coloured velvet, with
  paste buttons and flowered waistcoat, sat in one of the low <i>bergères</i>.
  He appeared distressed, and, a rare thing for him, he spoke very little.
  Julie had tried desperately to interest him in the last work by M. Thomas,
  the last opera, the last gossip of the day; but he had not responded.</p>

  <p>Too often she found him, as Madame de Maintenon had found Louis XIV.,
  'unamusable': he was not a man for a <i>tête-a-tête</i>. Julie had several
  times had the humiliation of seeing him on the verge of boredom; once he had
  fallen asleep in the midst of her brilliant conversation.</p>

  <p>To-night she looked apprehensively at his pleasant face. Ironically
  enough, he was the first man whom she had so failed to entertain. The
  knowledge that the fault did not lie in herself, but in his nature that
  needed crowds, gaiety, all the stimulus of society, did not help to make her
  situation any more bearable. It seemed to her now as she looked at his dull
  pose and indifferent face, that the physical tie was the only one between
  them, and that if they were not in each other's arms, blinded by passion,
  they were nothing to each other. How different, she thought, bitterly, had
  been that perfect communion of souls that had united her and M. de Mora.</p>

  <p>'I like you to come in the evening,' she remarked on the impulse of her
  thought, 'because you have the less excuse to plead an engagement with
  Monsieur So-and-So and Madame This-or-That; with Gluck or Chastellux or
  Crillon; but, <i>mon ami</i>, when you but come here to show me how wearisome
  I am&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Julie!' he protested.</p>

  <p>'Ail!' she flashed in return, 'you treat me as if I were one of those
  tiresome romances by Madame Scuderi, to be yawned through.'...</p>

  <p>She stood before him, a tragic figure. He raised his glance to her and
  dimly felt her force and her agony. This vexed and made him uneasy. His
  luxurious temperament did not care to be forced to contemplate this fierce
  and ruined soul; already the tie was beginning to fret, the claim to be
  resisted, the sentiment fading to occasional outbursts of passion which were
  like the last spurts of flame in a dying fire.</p>

  <p>And the wretched Julie, with her stormy jealousy, her sensitiveness, her
  suspicions,' her moods and tears, was doing nothing to win back this spoilt,
  vain, easy nature. Even now, when her heart's desire was fulfilled by his
  presence, she could not resist striking at him though she thrice wounded
  herself in so doing.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert heartily disliked the scenes that were becoming so frequent
  in the company of Julie. With an effort he endeavoured to avert this one.</p>

  <p>'If I found you so wearisome, <i>mon ami</i>, should I be here?'</p>

  <p>These words were insincere. M. de Guibert would much rather have been
  petted by Madame de Boufflers, or soothed by Madame de Montsauge to-night
  than reproached by Julie de Lespinasse, and his visit had only been for a
  special purpose. He was really tired; lately he had been overdoing both work
  and pleasure; he was worried by his restless ambitions and agitated by
  private confusions in his affairs.</p>

  <p>'I do not know why you are here,' replied Julie, regardless of the note of
  appeal in his voice. 'You rob me of my thoughts of one infinitely
  beloved.'</p>

  <p>His eyes darkened.</p>

  <p>'Cannot I see you but you remind me of M. de Mora? <i>Mon Dieu</i> I how
  long will you continue to drag that spectre between us?'</p>

  <p>'A spectre that haunts me day and night!' returned Julie wildly. 'Do you
  think that I am ever free of him? I am glad that you also, heartless as you
  are, sometimes suffer from the thought of the man you so wronged.'</p>

  <p>'You are unjust,' replied M. de Guibert with a flush. 'I have nothing on
  my conscience towards M. de Mora.'</p>

  <p>'All! you boast of your insensibility&mdash;you delight in your
  cruelty!'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert was vexed and showed it. He could hardly control his
  impatience. Very far was he from those heights where he and she had once
  stood. He was inclined to curse the chance that had led him to mingle his
  destiny with that of this tempestuous and agonised creature.</p>

  <p>'I am dull,' he said, in a tone of forced and artificial gallantry,
  'because I have to leave you.'</p>

  <p>'Leave me!' she ejaculated.</p>

  <p>'For a short time&mdash;it is necessary.'</p>

  <p>Julie stared at him. She was unable to conceive anything more terrible
  than this&mdash;that he should leave her!...They had never been separated
  since the fatal month of February.</p>

  <p>'For how long?' she added faintly.</p>

  <p>'For a few months&mdash;on business.'</p>

  <p>Her proud delicacy forbade her to press him as to the nature of this
  business; but her watchful jealousy could not be entirely silent.</p>

  <p>'To go to Bréteche, to Madame de Montsauge she cried.</p>

  <p>'No,' he answered.</p>

  <p>'To Montauban&mdash;to your people?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>!' exclaimed Julie, almost beside herself, 'what does this
  reticence mean? What new torture have you devised for me?'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert moved uneasily in his chair. At that moment he was prepared
  to consign all women to perdition. He gave Julie a look that was almost
  appealing, as if he entreated her to leave him in peace.</p>

  <p>Julie stood erect, her hands clasped on her heart, and utter misery in her
  great eyes. She was elaborately dressed for the supper with Madame de
  Chatillon. Her good taste had forbidden her to go into mourning for M. de
  Mora; yet his friends and hers had expected it, and Julie herself had no
  heart for gay clothes, and she had compromised on black and white. She now
  wore a robed <i>à la polonaise</i>, an extravagant fashion of hooped
  petticoat, introduced by the new Queen, of white broché and striped taffeta,
  with a bodice laced with black velvet over ruffles of fine muslin. Her hair
  was powdered dead white; her face was made up to disguise the ravages of her
  illness. She wore no jewel or flower or colour, and was a mournful figure in
  her haggard whiteness.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert glanced at her, and then away again. His fresh, firm face
  was clouded. Darling of the <i>salons</i> as he was, he had little art to
  help himself through a moment so disagreeable.</p>

  <p>'Believe,' he said awkwardly, 'that I would not go if I could avoid
  it.'</p>

  <p>'I believe nothing,' replied Julie stormily, 'save that you do not love
  me.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon ami</i>, must we meet but to quarrel?'</p>

  <p>'If you had any tenderness, any consideration, any sympathy, we should not
  quarrel!' cried Julie hotly. 'But you have none of these things&mdash;your
  soul is empty, and your heart is but full of false ambition.'</p>

  <p>'You mistake me,' answered M. de Guibert dryly. 'My ambitions are not
  false&mdash;if true glory is to be acquired in this age of little things I
  will acquire it. I have no other desires.'</p>

  <p>Julie was now trembling with anger at his continued coldness; she loathed
  herself because she was quivering with the desire for him to take her in his
  arms and kiss away the quarrel, and loathed him because he did not do so.</p>

  <p>In her agony she struck at him fiercely. 'You have neither feeling, nor
  any noble sentiment. <i>Mon Dieu</i>! how could I have been so misled by
  you&mdash;I, who was loved with the perfect love of a perfect nature&mdash;I,
  who know what real love can be? I despise myself and you and the fate that
  brought us together!'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert rose.</p>

  <p>'I cannot pretend to follow your feelings,' he said, 'nor your whims and
  caprices. You speak to me as if I were the worst of scoundrels. If you
  reflect on the manner of our coming together, you can judge if I have wronged
  you or not.'</p>

  <p>The miserable Julie shivered with despair at the hard tone in which he
  pronounced these words.</p>

  <p>'My violence should show you how much I love you,' she said
  desperately.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon amie!</i>' replied M. de Guibert, who was glad of an excuse to
  leave her before she pressed for further explanations, 'I set a greater value
  on softer affections.'</p>

  <p>This was sufficient to dissipate Julie's last remnant of control. She
  thought his tactless words referred to the placid love of Madame de
  Montsauge, and her bitter wrath knew no bounds.</p>

  <p>'Leave me she cried, facing him as if he had been a fierce enemy. 'I have
  need of repose from you&mdash;you trouble me. If you have any decency left
  you will disturb me no more. Ah! must I bar my doors to you?'</p>

  <p>'Rest assured I shall not besiege them,' he returned haughtily.</p>

  <p>'No!' panted Julie. 'Doubtless you will be happy with your Madame de
  Montsauge.'</p>

  <p>'Leave that name,' said M. de Guibert, irritated beyond prudence. She is
  not the person you have to fear.'</p>

  <p>'Is there then another?' interrupted Julie fiercely. 'Madame de
  Boufflers?'</p>

  <p>'Your jealousy has nothing to dread from that stale coquette. Cease to
  torment me with these women.'</p>

  <p>'To whom do you refer?' demanded Julie, almost beside herself. 'How many
  wretched creatures do your base affections play with? Shall I find my rival
  among the dancers of the opera, or the wives of your friends?'</p>

  <p>'Among neither,' replied M. de Guibert, pale with anger.</p>

  <p>'Who is it, then?'</p>

  <p>'My only answer can be to remind you that I am not accountable to you for
  my actions.'</p>

  <p>'You behave like a villain.'</p>

  <p>'And you like a fury. <i>Mon Dieu</i>, have the charity to allow me to
  depart.'</p>

  <p>Julie had no words. Dumb, she sank on to the ottoman and covered her face
  with her hands.</p>

  <p>She heard the doors dose, and knew that he had left her alone in her
  torture.</p>

  <p>And while he was turning his steps towards the hotel of Madame de
  Montsauge, resolving to break off a <i>liason</i> that was becoming so
  vexatious, the wretched woman, humbled to the dust by the hand which had once
  exalted her to the heavens, was seated at her desk feverishly writing a
  letter of penitence and impassioned love...</p>

  <p>Anything, anything would she sacrifice as long as she did not lose
  him...but she had no more sacrifices to make...</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

  <p class="first">Neither Julie's letters, her tears, her anger, her
  abasement, could either discover the object of M. de Guibert's journey, nor
  delay his departure. Since his meetings with her were almost always stormy,
  he avoided seeing her save in company, and though he strove to make peace
  with her by correspondence, he was maladroit enough to write to her of a
  visit Madame de Montsauge had paid him as he was sealing a letter for Julie:
  'It is not love, nor jealousy, that caused her to make these reproaches; but
  she had counted on my friendship; that she had regarded as the repose of her
  heart and the happiness of the rest of her life...the was very tender, very
  interesting, though there was nothing, either on her side or mine, of our
  ancient sentiments. She was full of reason, of philosophy, of wit&mdash;I
  would that you could have heard her.'</p>

  <p>The self-confidence, the naive vanity of letters such as these, wounded at
  once the delicacy and the pride of Julie. She responded in tones of bitter
  haughtiness.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">'You make a merit of all that you do <u>not</u> do for
  Madame de Montsauge. Mon ami, there is this difference between us&mdash;she
  loved you and I love you&mdash;after that, talk no more of
  <u>sacrifices!</u>'</p><br>

  <p>But she could not long allow herself these reproofs. She learnt from the
  gossip of the <i>salons</i> that M. de Guibert had left Paris without either
  farewells or warnings. Julie, returning in despair to her little
  <i>salon</i>, wrote to the runaway, sending the letter in charge of the
  porter at the rue Taranne:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">'You wish to make a secret of your voyage. If you are not
  ashamed of the object of it, why do you fear to tell it to me? And if this
  journey must offend me, why do you take it? Never have you had with me the
  abandon of confidence...I know not where you are...I am ignorant of your
  actions. Mon ami, does the most ordinary friendship behave thus? And can I
  think without grief that you, of your free will, leave me? You spoke of an
  absence of four months&mdash;and you did not give me the last evening that
  you had in Paris?'</p><br>

  <p>No reply came to this letter, and the unhappy creature wrote
  again:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">I have no news from you...Yesterday I had an access of
  despair that gave me convulsions that lasted four hours...When I see you I
  love you to madness...but I must see you to love you...The rest of my life is
  filled with regrets, with remembrances and with tears. Be frank; tell me that
  you love another. I want it&mdash;I desire it; I am torn by a grief so
  profound that I expect no relief save from death. That which you bring me has
  the effect of opium: it suspends my pain, but it does not cure, and, on the
  contrary, it leaves me more sensible and more feeble. I am no longer capable
  of loving&mdash;I only know how to suffer...Why did you trouble to make
  yourself beloved of me?</p>

  <p class="letter">'You had no need of my affection, you knew that you could
  never return it...Did you amuse yourself with my despair? Give me back my
  heart; torment me no more. Love me always, or efface the love I have for
  you&mdash;in a word, do the impossible&mdash;calm me or I die.'...</p><br>

  <p>Several days passed without a reply. Julie, who could not induce M.
  D'Alembert to leave her, had to support the company that came to see him and
  which distracted her in her agony of secret anguish without consoling her.
  She had not been able to discover from any one where M. de Guibert was: she
  could only believe that he was with Madame de Montsauge.</p>

  <p>She recalled the one occasion when she had met this lady. It was at the
  Mass at Saint-Sulpice, where Julie had gone to hear the music. It had been in
  the early days of her rapture, and in her false security she had praised her
  rival: she was beautiful, charming&mdash;her taste a little vulgar&mdash;her
  manners a little commonplace.</p>

  <p>Julie laughed at herself now, as she thought of that mad burst of
  generosity towards a woman whom she had always had to fear. Doubtless Madame
  de Montsauge was coolly magnanimous towards her now; her blood burnt to think
  of it. Surely he had treated her shamefully.</p>

  <p>She recalled the previous fatal May that he had been absent for a few
  days, and she had never known where...doubtless then, as now, with Madame de
  Montsauge.</p>

  <p>She passed the weary days in corresponding with her faithful friends and
  in reading her lover's tragedy, <i>Anne Boleyn</i>. She seldom left her
  bedchamber, never the house. Her health was more wretched than ever; she was
  attacked by pains in the chest that almost stopped her breath, and that laid
  her prostrate and moaning for hours.</p>

  <p>At last one hot morning in June, M. D'Alembert brought a letter from M. de
  Guibert. Julie glanced at the ever dear writing with mingled relief and
  terror.</p>

  <p>'This has not come by the post?' she asked faintly.</p>

  <p>'No,' returned the little philosopher placidly. 'Henri told me it had been
  left by a valet.'</p>

  <p>He continued talking to her of other subjects. Julie did not hear him; she
  was staring at the letter, a thin letter, which she held in her bloodless,
  emaciated hands.</p>

  <p>She sat in one of the <i>bergères</i> near the tulipwood table, that bore
  a great bowl of jasmine. She wore a plain robe and skirt of black gauze with
  a fine muslin fichu. Her face was pallid beneath the close powdered hair.</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert continued talking; his keen, plain face was full of
  animation and the fire of intelligence as he spoke of what was happening in
  the great world&mdash;Turgot in power, Necker to follow: ancient wrongs to be
  redressed at last, reason and justice to trample superstition and
  tyranny...Julie continued to finger her letter; she heard nothing of what the
  philosopher was saying; she cared nothing for what was taking place in
  France.</p>

  <p>At last her cold fingers broke the seal and drew out the short note. There
  was no address; it was brief, ironic, worse than cold. He did not want her
  love; she burdened him; he wished to be free. Must she always follow him with
  her jealousies and troubles? He wished for peace.</p>

  <p>Julie folded up the letter and sat quite still. M. D'Alembert continued to
  talk&mdash;of M. Turgot, of France, of the Academy.</p>

  <p>'I must leave you for a little while,' said Julie at last. 'My
  head...aches.'</p>

  <p>She rose now, carefully, with a reserved gesture, repulsing his instant
  solicitude.</p>

  <p>'Send no one...You know that these times I wish to be alone.'</p>

  <p>Looking like a widow in her black, helping herself by the furniture by the
  left hand, holding the letter to her thin bosom with her right, she gained
  her chamber and locked herself in. So often had she been alone in this room
  with hideous thoughts that it had become like a place of torture to her. She
  stumbled to the window, where the red damask curtains had been drawn back
  from the blinds that protected the room from the blazing sun. She opened
  these and looked on to the dry, hot street and the pale, hot sky.</p>

  <p>It was Saturday, and some of the church bells were practising for the
  morrow's services; their metallic clang gave the summer air a sense of
  emptiness.</p>

  <p>His letter&mdash;his dry, cold, disdainful letter...the letter of a man
  telling a woman he is tired of her, fretted with her&mdash;a man using the
  power a woman puts in his hands when she gives herself without price...the
  commonplace letter of a commonplace man, written in commonplace
  circumstances...This was what her glory and her dream, her agony and her
  sacrifice had come to...This was the fruit of her tragedy.</p>

  <p>She left the window, went to her desk, moving in a still fashion, put his
  letters with the others in the rose-coloured portfolio that she kept so
  carefully locked, and began to write, a frail, black figure, whose delicate
  head was bent low with the burden of pain, and whose fragile hand travelled
  fast over the paper.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">'Judge me mad, if you will; believe me unjust, all that you
  please, this will not prevent me from telling you that never in my life have
  I received an impression so painful, so wounding, as that given me by your
  letter...</p>

  <p class="letter">'I feel myself so humiliated, so degraded to think that I
  have given any one the terrible right to write to me like this, and so
  naturally that I cannot doubt the truth of it nor suppose that you paused to
  wonder if you would offend me mortally.</p>

  <p class="letter">'Ha! you have well avenged M. de Mora! You punish me
  cruelly for the delirium, the madness that led me to you! How I detest that
  folly! I shall not enter into details; you have not either enough goodness or
  enough delicacy to understand my complaints.</p>

  <p class="letter">'My heart, my pride, all that animates me, all that makes
  me feel, think, breathe, in a word all that is in me, is revolted, wounded
  and offended for ever.'</p><br>

  <p>She paused, for a cough shook her, a bitter breath parted her pale lips;
  her body was almost fainting with weakness, but her spirit could not rest
  until it had expressed some of its haughty passion.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">'You have given me enough force, not to support my
  anguish&mdash;it appears to me more terrible, more overwhelming than
  ever&mdash;but to assure me that I shall never be more tormented nor unhappy
  for your sake.</p>

  <p class="letter">'Judge of the excess of my sin and the greatness of my
  loss: I feel, and my sorrow does not deceive itself, that if M. de Mora lived
  and could read your letter, he would pardon me, he would console me in hating
  you.</p>

  <p class="letter">'Ah, mon Dieu! leave me my regrets&mdash;they are a
  thousand times dearer to me than that which you call your sentiment, and
  which is hateful to me; its expression is contemptible and my soul repels it
  with a horror that shows me that I am still worthy of being virtuous.</p>

  <p class="letter">'How have you dared, how could you bring yourself to form
  the words which, if they fell under the eyes of others would make me lost and
  dishonoured for ever? If they are the expression of what you feel and what
  you think, believe, at least believe that I shall not be vile enough to
  justify myself nor to ask for pardon, and as you must believe that you have
  rendered me less than justice, I prefer leaving you in that opinion to
  entering into an explanation. It is finished, then; be with me as you can, as
  you will. For me, in the future, if there is a future for me&mdash;I shall be
  with you as I ought always to have been, and if you leave no remorse in my
  soul, I have good hopes of forgetting you. I know now that wounded pride
  steels the heart. I have not been accustomed to this commerce of cruelty and
  liberty. It is true, also, that never before have I been guilty; this
  reflection makes me find your conduct less remarkable, but not more
  honest.'</p><br>

  <p>She paused, kissed the little hair ring of M. de Mora that she wore, and
  then went on with feverish haste, the tears overbrimming her eyes:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">'I know not why I wrote to you all I did in the past you
  see there all my weakness, but not all my unhappiness. I hoped nothing from
  you, I would not be consoled. Why then complain? Ha! why? Because the dying
  man still waits for the doctor; because his eyes are still searching for hope
  in the faces of those about him; because the last cry of the soul is for
  succour. This is the explanation of my folly, my inconsequence, my weakness.
  How I am punished!</p>

  <p class="letter">'If ever there comes to me a thought that can offend the
  sentiment that M. de Mora had for me, I shall reread your letter, and in this
  humiliation I shall expiate my sin.</p>

  <p class="letter">'Return me this paper and have the honour to remember the
  line of "Phèdre" that I have quoted.'</p><br>

  <p>She dosed and sealed the letter and addressed it to the rue Taranne.</p>

  <p>She imagined his receiving it in the company of</p>

  <p>Madame de Montsauge; she conceived his using light speech of her as she
  had heard him use of other women...and she remembered with an unutterable and
  bitter longing the love of M. de Mora.</p>

  <p>Again she crept to the window. There was a heartrending melancholy in the
  cloudless skies, the empty sunshine...The long days seemed eventless,
  sterile, wearisome, like her own barren life. Her own existence seemed so
  purposeless, so cruel, so doomed; images from her sad history came, like
  phantoms, to haunt her loneliness&mdash;the poor surgeon's lodgings in Lyons
  where she had been secretly born one November evening, the church of
  Saint-Paul where she had been baptized under the name of fictitious parents,
  which places she had afterwards gone to visit with steps at once curious and
  reluctant; the splendid chateau of D'Avanges where she had been caressed by
  the mother who dare not recognise her nor provide for her; Champrond where
  she had been so unhappy, where she had endured such shameful knowledge, and
  suffered such bitter treatment&mdash;the convent in Lyons where she had
  retired in despair&mdash;Paris!</p>

  <p>Human phantoms, too, were there in her sad visions: her mother, delicate,
  frail, weak and sorrowful; her sister, cold and indifferent; her nephew Abel,
  whom she had always loved&mdash;he alone of all her family; Gaspard de Vichy,
  the stern soldier to whose relationship she hardly dare place a name; Madame
  du Deffand, that terrible blind figure...Another figure came to her
  mind&mdash;a strange figure of one whom she had never seen, but who was her
  nearest relation, the sharer of the same secret, the same shame, the same
  doom&mdash;her brother, Henri Laurent Hilaire, for nearly twenty-five years
  monk in the order of the Cordelier Fathers of Saint-Bonaventure at Lyons.
  This life, as secret and obscure as the secret and obscure birth had been,
  and as the secret and obscure death would be, that was hidden from Julie, yet
  bound her by a closer tie of blood than any other in the world, affected her
  with a vague sense of horror. Both gages of the same illicit love, how
  different had been their fates&mdash;he a monk, she the disciple of Voltaire;
  he buried in oblivion, she famous. 'Yet how much happier is he than I,'
  thought Julie. 'If only I could have been left in the ignorance of a
  convent&mdash;my enlightenment has only taught me to suffer.'</p>

  <p>A light and timid tap on her door recalled her to the present. It was M.
  D'Alembert, who could no longer endure her absence. Was she ill? Should he
  send for Madame Saint-Martin&mdash;the doctor?</p>

  <p>She came and unlocked the door and tried to speak to him gently and
  soothingly; his love had now a certain value for her; she wished to be rid of
  his presence, but she had no desire to lose his affection.</p>

  <p>As soon as he saw her he led her to the red ottoman and piled up the
  cushions behind her, brought a footstool, and fetched her wine and biscuits
  and a plate of the beautiful grapes sent by Madame de Marchais. These
  attentions did not please or console Julie, but she could not resist them for
  sheer weakness and because she was struggling for the calm that would
  disguise from this anxious friend the trouble that was tearing her soul.</p>

  <p>She gave him the letter to M. de Guibert. As she did so, she told herself
  that it was the last she would ever write with that name on the envelope.</p>

  <p>In his calm, amiable fashion M. D'Alembert began speaking of M. de
  Guibert: 'This long peace is his misfortune. His drama is not as good as his
  tactics. I doubt the lasting success of <i>Le Constable de Bourbon</i>.'</p>

  <p>'The <i>salons</i> talk of nothing else,' said Julie dully.</p>

  <p>'The Duc D'Orleans has asked for a special audience; the Queen wants it
  given at Versailles.'</p>

  <p>'Simply because the young man is the fashion with the women; he has a
  beautiful voice&mdash;he reads well&mdash;that is all.'</p>

  <p>Julie's beaten soul writhed within. 'The fashion with the
  women'&mdash;'the fashion with the women!'</p>

  <p>She listened a little longer to D'Alembert's talk; she forced some
  responses, a smile or two; then she escaped to her room again, to write
  letters, she said.</p>

  <p>It would have frightened M. D'Alembert could he have seen those letters;
  pages of them there were, filled with half-delirious remorse, regret, love,
  longing&mdash;and addressed to M. de Mora, Notre-Dame de Puy Paulin,
  Bordeaux.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she flung down her pen and looked round over her shoulder.</p>

  <p>'Ha!' she cried, 'why do I need to write to you when you are always behind
  me?'</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

  <p class="first">He took her reproaches lightly, being too used to the moods
  of women in general, and not sufficiently versed in the moods of this woman
  in particular. He had not yet come any nearer to an understanding of the
  tragedy of Julie de Lespinasse, and her noble and agonised reproofs seemed to
  him the mere usual upbraidings of a slighted woman, to which he was already
  inured.</p>

  <p>He wrote to her in a tone that showed he did not take her anger seriously,
  but he did not do the one thing that might have moved Julie&mdash;disclose
  the object of his journey and his address.</p>

  <p>His tenderness only disgusted her; she was too deeply wounded, too utterly
  humiliated to respond to his overtures, to what seemed a renewal of his
  affection.</p>

  <p>He returned to Paris and she would not see him.</p>

  <p>'Have the honesty to cease to persecute me,' she wrote to him. 'I have
  only one wish, I have only one desire, that is&mdash;to see you no
  more...Leave me; count no more on me. If I can calm myself I will live; but
  if you continue to persecute me you will soon have to reproach yourself with
  having given me the strength of despair. Spare me the chagrin and the
  embarrassment of having to exclude you from my rooms when I am alone.'</p>

  <p>For over a week she continued her resistance; then he forced her door, as
  he had done when he had saved her from suicide, and now&mdash;as
  then&mdash;she was in his arms as soon as she saw him face to face.</p>

  <p>'What horrible project have I conceived&mdash;not to see you! It would
  have been impossible! You know it. You know that when I hate you it is
  because I love you with such a degree of passion that my reason is unsettled.
  Yes, I love you, a thousand times more than I know how to say...I love you
  more than I dare tell you.'</p>

  <p>Once more the force of her passion swept him to the heights with her; once
  more he was hers; once more the delicious poison intoxicated and enfeebled
  her desperate soul.</p>

  <p>But the first glow of this reconciliation was hardly passed before he told
  her that he must leave her again, this time without mystery, but for several
  months. He had to visit his father's estates at Montauban and pass some time
  with his family.</p>

  <p>He showed himself full of regret for this enforced absence, tender and
  considerate with Julie. More studious of her happiness than perhaps he had
  ever been; and she bloomed in this warmth of love like a flower in the sun.
  His slight illness caused her a passionate solicitude that was almost
  maternal. She was the wisest critic that he had of his work, in which she
  took more real interest than did the countless admirers that lost their heads
  over his genius. Her fine judgment, her keen intelligence, delighted to serve
  him.</p>

  <p>In these days there was a lull in the course of her malady, and she ceased
  to write to M. de Mora.</p>

  <p>They saw each other every day&mdash;at his rooms, at hers, at the houses
  of their friends, at the opera, at the Italian Comedy, at the French Comedy;
  they passed days together in the country on a visit to some chateau near
  Paris. If they were separated for half a day they wrote to each other.</p>

  <p>Julie fought against his fresh departure, begged him at least not to
  travel on a Friday, which had painful associations for her in the history of
  M. de Mora, who had always started his journeys on a Friday&mdash;and on a
  Friday died.</p>

  <p>'Think how this recollection frightens me in connection with you, whom I
  love more than happiness, more than life, more than I have words to express,'
  she said.</p>

  <p>One day that late summer, Julie called at his rooms in the rue Taranne; he
  was supposed to have left Paris. She found him there, but the elegant
  <i>salon</i> was in the confusion of departure.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert was alone, and greeted her tenderly. Julie received his
  kisses without animation and sank down on one of the gold and lemon-coloured
  striped silk chairs. She wore a robe of black-and-white satin in wide stripes
  and a black hat and feather, from underneath which her hair fell in long
  curls heavily pomaded. She was skilfully rouged in defiance of her pallor,
  and her eyes gleamed dark and fiery, full of resolution and pride. Some white
  roses showed among the laces at her breast, and a delicate perfume came from
  her beautiful clothes. A great and noble lady she looked, sitting gracefully
  at her ease and slowly waving to and fro her black silk fan.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert, having an uneasy conscience, did not care either for the
  unexpected visit, her flashing eyes, or her silence. But he was proud of the
  gorgeous creature she was and endeavoured to please her by every means.</p>

  <p>'You cannot think how it weighs on me that I must leave you,' he said.
  'All day I have been full of sad thoughts.'</p>

  <p>'Why?' asked Julie coldly.</p>

  <p>'Because of you&mdash;your health&mdash;and you are not happy.'</p>

  <p>'You know why&mdash;you know the only sentiment that attaches me to
  life.'</p>

  <p>'I know it is one to which you will never entirely give yourself,' he
  answered quickly. 'It is half-killed by your regrets and may be entirely
  killed by this absence.'</p>

  <p>'Why, then, do you leave me?' asked Julie ironically. 'My father awaits
  me. I should have left fifteen days ago: with the visits I have to make on
  the way and the project I have of returning here in October, that leaves but
  two months with him.'</p>

  <p>Julie was silent. M. de Guibert paced up and down the room, speaking with
  some agitation: 'My inquietude will make the time long! How necessary your
  letters will be to me! Will mine be so to you?'</p>

  <p>He paused in front of her.</p>

  <p>'I will write them as if they were.' Julie smiled slowly and bitterly.</p>

  <p>'But this occupation,' continued M. de Guibert with tender warmth, 'will
  not fill the horrible emptiness left by your society...Ah! it will cost me
  something to give up the sweet habit I have formed of seeing you every
  day.'</p>

  <p>Julie shivered and regarded him with sombre eyes.</p>

  <p>'Why are you so silent? Do you not believe me? You and my work would fill
  my life. When I am near you my ambition is extinct.'</p>

  <p>He took her hand and held it against the laces on his heart; it lay cold
  and lax in his warm clasp.</p>

  <p>'Julie! Julie! you have given me fresh ideas of glory&mdash;of
  happiness&mdash;of repose. Be happy, <i>mon amie</i>. Nothing shall come
  between us. Never has my existence been so strongly attached to that of
  another.'</p>

  <p>'Never?' echoed Julie wanly.</p>

  <p>'Never! I have had sentiments more tumultuous&mdash;never one so
  sweet&mdash;one on which I could found the happiness of my life.'</p>

  <p>She drew her hand away and rose.</p>

  <p>'Why do you mock me with this false language?' she said. 'You blaspheme
  great things. You do not love me at all. The happiness of your life You would
  not sacrifice half a day's comfort for me.'</p>

  <p>'Why do you so wrong me, Julie?'</p>

  <p>'AM protest no more!' she cried impetuously, 'for you speak to me who
  knows what love is. There was a man who did found his happiness on my
  affections&mdash;who lived for me and by me, who had no thought but to serve
  me...whose dearest wish was to offer all he had&mdash;who would have married
  me, though he was the heir of Fuentès...and I am...Julie de Lespinasse.'</p>

  <p>Even M. de Guibert's self-confidence blenched before the proud bitterness
  of these words. To marry her! Certainly it had never entered his head. He had
  no defence.</p>

  <p>'So we will leave talk of love,' added Julie. 'I came to ask you why you
  lied to me?'</p>

  <p>The colour rose in his fair face.</p>

  <p>'Two days ago I waited for you&mdash;you never came&mdash;you told me you
  were in the country with M. D'Augessan. I have now discovered you were with
  Madame de Montsauge in Paris, although you said she had left at five that
  afternoon for Bréteche.'</p>

  <p>Even 'M. de Guibert's candid egotism found this challenge difficult to
  deal with. He stood silent, looking very young in his troubled vexation.</p>

  <p>'Why did you deceive me?' continued Julie. 'Do you not see how I
  suffer&mdash;how you humiliate me? You abuse my tenderness. You cause me to
  abhor the moments of consolation and of joy that I owe you. You denied me
  death&mdash;my sole resource&mdash;that you might plunge me into this
  frightful unhappiness. You fill my soul with remorse&mdash;you make me hate
  you&mdash;yes, hate you, <i>mon ami</i>.'</p>

  <p>'Julie! Julie!'...</p>

  <p>'Ha! you have made me ill: during these three days that I have not seen
  you I have, been prostrate. Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>! this fever of the soul
  reaches delirium. What body would be strong enough to resist such
  suffering?'</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon amie</i>, listen! It was true that I was in the country at
  Chanteloup; since my return I have been occupied with my <i>Eloge de
  Catinat</i>.'</p>

  <p>Julie glanced round the disordered room&mdash;the portmanteaux waiting to
  be strapped.</p>

  <p>'And you were leaving again without letting me know of your
  return&mdash;without a farewell.'</p>

  <p>'Did you not get my letter?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, but at the same time I learnt that you had been with Madame de
  Montsauge and had left for Chanteloup twelve hours later than you said.'</p>

  <p>She tightly clasped her thin hands on her frail heart, so that the hair
  ring of M. de Mora cut into the flesh.</p>

  <p>'Why did you tell me you were tired of that woman? Did I ask you to
  abandon her? Why did you complain of her when you have for her this
  unconquerable affection? Why tell me your heart was empty when she filled
  it?'</p>

  <p>'In my letter&mdash;' he began.</p>

  <p>'Ah! your letter...I would not read it...</p>

  <p>What do you think that cost me? What effort to put it in my portfolio
  sealed?...How often have I had it in my hands...even in the night I felt the
  need to touch it...I wanted to be strong.' Her voice softened and her
  indignant eyes filled with tears. 'I thought of nothing but that sealed
  letter...yet I wanted to resist you...At last, yesterday, I opened it...and
  see my folly!...I loved you more than ever...Then I heard that you were back
  in Paris and I was filled with contempt for both of us&mdash;you for the
  evasion, myself for the pursuit.'</p>

  <p>She trembled all over as she spoke, as if she shuddered with unendurable
  nausea, and dropped again into the gay little chair.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert was sincerely moved by her distress; his good nature was
  always ready to endure the reproofs that his carelessness provoked, and his
  genuine love for Julie was always roused by the sight of her suffering.</p>

  <p>'How I am grieved at all the evil I have done you. I am wrong and I do not
  pretend to justify myself,' he declared with impetuous frankness. 'I
  concealed from you that I was with Madame de Montsauge&mdash;she left at nine
  instead of five, and I was with her until her departure.'</p>

  <p>'And when you left her?' demanded Julie.</p>

  <p>'I returned here. In leaving her I could not come to you.'</p>

  <p>'You were too sad!'</p>

  <p>Heedless of the irony in her voice, M. de Guibert blundered on in his
  charming, musical voice:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'"This is no more than friendship," she told me, "but it is friendship
  warm and tender that it would cost me a mortal pain to forgo." Her eyes were
  full of tears, <i>mon amie</i>. Mine also were wet. You see with what
  frankness I speak to you. You understand my position&mdash;my need of
  reticence.'</p>

  <p>'Lies!' said Julie bitterly, 'lies!'</p>

  <p>'Lies, then, if you will,' he replied, drawing away from her with dignity.
  'Lies, if you will call them so; but their origin has never been falsehood,
  but delicacy towards you...<i>Grand Dieu</i>! why must you establish this
  hatred and contempt between us? You know how I was drawn to you, and at the
  same time I never concealed from you that I was attached to another.'</p>

  <p>'You admit, then, that you care for her?' interrupted Julie violently.</p>

  <p>'My heart is a labyrinth. Cannot your sensibility have some consideration
  for me. I do not understand myself. When I left her I tried to examine
  myself. I felt that I was not cured, and yet that there was no one dearer to
  me than you...Ah, <i>grands Dieux</i> is there not between your situation and
  mine a similarity that should excite your indulgence? You love me and your
  soul is full of M. de Mora. If I tried to detach you from his memory I should
  detach you from life itself. <i>Mon ami</i>, we are, you and I, strange
  examples of the intricacies of the human heart.'</p>

  <p>This defence, given with eloquence and sincere feeling, served to enrage
  Julie more than any insult could have done. His obtuseness, his egotism, his
  venturing to quote his vulgar intrigue in the same breath with her noble
  love&mdash;to compare his easy infidelity with her agony, wounded and stung
  her beyond bearing. She turned on him, her whole figure, her face, her pose,
  expressing fury.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>!' she cried, 'who has been the object of the sacrifice I
  have made of my honour? A man who has never loved me, who is cruel
  enough&mdash;false enough, to tell me that he has made me his victim without
  loving me! After having betrayed me, after having deceived me a thousand
  times, you take a barbarous pleasure in telling me a truth that outrages me
  and abases me!'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert endeavoured to check the bitter torrent of her words, but
  Julie was beyond reason. Had he not confessed to an affection for Madame de
  Montsauge? Was not the nightmare of her days realised in this confession?</p>

  <p>'You say that I owe you <i>indulgence!</i>' she gasped. 'You vaunt the
  <i>delicacy</i> of your sentiment, that caused you to lie from morning to
  night. Ha! you expect me to be grateful to you for reducing me to
  despair?'</p>

  <p>'You have not understood me,' said M. de Guibert, confused and on the
  verge of anger. 'You use terms that revolt me. I am neither as false nor as
  dishonest as you believe.'</p>

  <p>She moved away from him. She was drawn to her full height, her nostrils
  distended, her face livid, her eyes sparkling. With a great effort she
  struggled with the constant cough that tore her chest.</p>

  <p>'I have nothing more to fear from you!' she panted. 'You were only
  dangerous for me as long as I believed in you...Now I see you as you are.
  <i>Adieu!</i> If one day I can cost you a regret and make you know remorse, I
  shall be avenged.'</p>

  <p>She essayed to open the door, but her strength failed her and she leant
  against it, her handkerchief pressed to her quivering lips, fighting for her
  painful breath.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert made no attempt to approach her. His gray eyes were dark
  with anger. He was conscious of no wrong towards her and of some wrong to
  himself. The beginning of their love-affair was very uppermost in his mind.
  He recalled how she had cast herself into his arms on his return from
  Prussia&mdash;her joy and triumph that February night at the opera...And now
  she spoke to him as if he was a heartless seducer!</p>

  <p>'You overwhelm me,' he said coldly. 'You speak of hate and show it.
  <i>Adieu</i>, then. You may cause me regrets, but never remorse. This is
  doubtless the last time that we shall see each other. I would rather that you
  abandoned me altogether than meet me but to hate me&mdash;to revile
  me&mdash;to outrage me. I shall neither expect your letters nor write any. If
  the news of your health is worse I will address myself to your friends.'</p>

  <p>Julie remained leaning against the door, her agonised stare on her
  lover.</p>

  <p>He was flushed and handsome in his anger; the colour had mounted to his
  pleasant eyes and stained his slightly thick neck. His hands were clasped
  behind the skirts of his pearl-coloured coat. His hair was not dressed and
  his cravat was dishevelled. There was something homely in this negligence
  that was infinitely dear to the woman who gazed on him with such hopeless
  passion.</p>

  <p>'<i>Adieu</i>,' he said again.</p>

  <p>Without a word she left the room.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

  <p class="first">For fifteen days after the departure of M. de Guibert,
  Julie's soul dwelt in silence, feeding on its own grief. She judged herself,
  her lover, the situation, with that keen intelligence that never failed her,
  save when blinded by some outburst of passion or emotion.</p>

  <p>And it was against herself that she pronounced judgment, she found that
  her conduct descended from the sublime to the absurd. She beheld herself in
  the most painful and foolish of positions&mdash;that of the middle-aged woman
  endeavouring to fix the affections of the young man. She admitted that there
  was neither right nor reason in her conduct, that she had been crying for the
  moon, asking for what did not exist.</p>

  <p>'Many women love him: he is young, charming, famous. There is not a single
  reason to draw him towards me, save, perhaps, pity. He was attracted to me
  despite himself&mdash;and I expect his entire fidelity.'</p>

  <p>So she reasoned, without faltering; so she judged herself, without mercy.
  For a while her body and soul were in fierce combat, but her spirit conquered
  the feeble flesh.</p>

  <p>She would set him free, she would liberate herself from this insensate
  love. She would atone for her blind pride and her headlong folly by
  renouncing whatever claim she might have had on her lover's errant heart.</p>

  <p>This resolution violently to tear herself from the one object that made
  life dear to her, this voluntary forfeiture of all her dreams and hopes, all
  that made her days supportable and thought of the future bearable, was not
  without heroism. Not without fierce suffering did she come to this resolution
  which was aided by his absence. Had she been forced to see him she could
  hardly have found so much courage.</p>

  <p>In the first calm following the exultation of her sacrifice she wrote to
  Jacques de Guibert at Montauban a letter that was a farewell to her unhappy
  love.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">'I pardon you all the cruel things that you have said to
  me, and I abjure, with all that remains to me of strength and reason, all
  that I have written to you in the convulsions of despair. Now I put into your
  hands my profession of faith. I promise you that I engage myself neither to
  expect nor to exact anything of you. If you preserve for me your friendship I
  shall enjoy it gratefully and peacefully; if you do not find me worthy I
  shall grieve without finding you unjust.</p>

  <p class="letter">'Adieu, mon ami. It is friendship that pronounces this
  name; it is not the less dear to my heart because it can trouble it no
  more.'</p><br>

  <p>She asked for all her letters back&mdash;a request she had frequently made
  before, and one that had never ceased to wound M. de Guibert. When the thing
  was done and the letter sent, she fell into a state of complete apathy; no
  more tears, no more convulsions, only the calm of a deep and profound
  melancholy. The old cry came to her lips: '<i>A quoi bon</i>?' 'I go to bed
  every night hoping that I shall not wake up in the morning,' she wrote to
  Condorcet.</p>

  <p>Sometimes during these sleepless nights she wrote to the spectre that
  never left her, invoking her dead lover with a yearning unspeakable.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert had to go to Bordeaux, and she exacted from him a complete
  account of the tragedy of the previous May; he must visit the inn&mdash;the
  church&mdash;the Spanish consul.</p>

  <p>He obeyed her with a delicacy and sweetness that won from her tears of
  gratitude. He had not agreed to her offer of platonic friendship, but he was
  eagerly pleased at her gentle resignation, her new tone of submission, and
  his letters were full of warm affection, of sad sentiment and touching
  reflections on the death of the rival whom he could now afford to pity.</p>

  <p>Julie was soothed by his attitude into believing that her love was dead,
  and that she could enjoy the placid friendship that had taken its place. She
  endeavoured to interest herself in what was going on about her&mdash;the
  success of M. D'Alembert at the Academy with his <i>Eloge de Desperaux</i>,
  the great movements at the Court that seemed to promise a new era for France,
  M. Turgot Controller-General, his party entirely in power.</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert was so delighted with the turn of public events that for
  once his attention was slightly distracted from Julie.</p>

  <p>'You never come to hear me now,' he said once on returning from the scene
  of his triumphs.</p>

  <p>Julie smiled. She lay on the Utrecht velvet ottoman, the red cushions
  piled under her back and head.</p>

  <p>'I have been too ill,' she said quietly. 'I have not had strength enough
  to hold myself on my chair.'</p>

  <p>He looked at her with swift anxiety. 'Are you worse, <i>mon amie</i>?'</p>

  <p>'No worse&mdash;the same.'</p>

  <p>He considered her with a keen look on his plain, tired, intelligent face.
  In his careless, sober attire, so at variance with the times and the circle
  to which he belonged, with his quiet humorous manner, gray hair, and frail
  figure, he looked anything but the ideal of a lover. But Julie knew that he
  loved her with a passion as deep and true as that with which she loved M. de
  Guibert. The irony of the thought caused her painful smile to deepen.</p>

  <p>'Never mind about me,' she said. 'Tell me more news.'</p>

  <p>'I know of none. I went to Madame de Boufflers. M. Crillon was there. I
  think she exerts herself to make an impression on him. That will be a blow to
  the vanity of M. de Guibert!'</p>

  <p>'I have observed that myself,' replied Julie calmly. 'Whenever she comes
  here he is with her. But I fancy that she wastes her time&mdash;he talks of
  getting married...he is much in debt.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Eh bien!</i> he has talked of that for some time, so has M. de
  Guibert. Young men must make a term to their dissipation.'</p>

  <p>'Do you think that M. de Guibert will marry?' asked Julie languidly. 'He
  spoke of it months ago, and I offered to find him a <i>parti</i> among my
  friends, but nothing came of it. I think that he loves too much the
  <i>brouhaha</i> of Society to put any chain on his liberty.'</p>

  <p>'He loves too much his own position in Society,' retorted M. D'Alembert
  shrewdly, 'to risk losing it through lack of money. I believe that his debts
  are beyond bounds&mdash;certainly his dissipations are.'</p>

  <p>'It is certainly a pity,' said Julie in the same cold, calm tone. 'Have I
  not often complained to him of the elegant emptiness in which he wastes his
  youth and his talents? He tells me that he is writing another
  tragedy&mdash;<i>Les Graques</i>.'</p>

  <p>'And no doubt he is very pleased with it,' replied M. D'Alembert with
  kindly tolerance, 'but I believe that he has mistaken the trend of his
  genius.'</p>

  <p>Julie winced at hearing this calm dispraise of M. de Guibert; yet she
  continued the subject ironically, prolonging her own pain.</p>

  <p>'What is he going to do, that young man,' she said, raising her feeble
  head from the red cushions, 'with all the gifts, all the opportunities, and
  no taste save for idle pleasure? But his <i>Eloge de Catinat</i>,' she added
  quickly, 'you admire that? It is good, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>Her tone, that she strove to render indifferent, was tinged with
  wistfulness.</p>

  <p>'It is good,' replied D'Alembert, 'but there is a life of Nicolas Catinat
  by one Turpin I have just read, which is its equal.'</p>

  <p>'I will send M. de Guibert a copy,' said Julie. 'But not with those words
  of mine.'</p>

  <p>'Nay,' she smiled sadly. 'I should be sorry to wound his candid
  self-confidence.'</p>

  <p>She sat up on her couch and turned languidly to the fire, which although
  it was yet only early autumn, burnt brightly in the polished hearth. Julie
  loved the warmth.</p>

  <p>She looked pale and frail in her gown of black and white Indian silk and
  her muslin cap on the powdered curls. She still took an interest in her
  dress, and her toilet was of extreme elegance if sombre; but her pose and
  expression were of a profound melancholy, and her movements had the
  feebleness of great ill-health. Her very grace was now the grace of a
  creature utterly broken, her vitality seemed quenched, her bright spirit that
  had been so ardent and fearless, quelled and obscured.</p>

  <p>But as she spoke calmly and was not prostrate with pain, M. D'Alembert was
  not more concerned about her than usual. He was now inured to the sight of
  her sufferings, and had that species of false security that comes to one who
  watches a very long illness; he was so used to her bad health, so habituated
  to the symptoms of her disease, that they made little impression on him. He
  was in continual anxiety but he had no definite fear.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had left her, Julie de Lespinasse held out her hand to the
  fire. It was almost transparent, the dark ring that she had given M. de Mora
  showed against her pale blood.</p>

  <p>For the first time the thought occurred to her that perhaps she was struck
  by that mortal malady of which her lover had died. If this were so, what a
  ghastly retribution and how mad for her to dream that suicide would
  expiate...Far longer, far more terrible the punishment. She must suffer all
  the pangs he had suffered, endure the same long, fruitless struggle, bow
  before the same premature, unnatural death.</p>

  <p>Her hands fell to her knee and clasped there tightly.</p>

  <p>Surely her fate was now revealed to her: this could be no passing illness,
  not merely the result of her agonies of soul.</p>

  <p>What was this continuous cough nothing would cure, this shortness of
  breath, this pain in her chest, this emaciation, this sickness, pain, and
  exhaustion?...What had her mother died of?</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>!' she murmured, 'it must be that I have only a few months
  to live&mdash;a year, perhaps. M. de Mora was as I am now when he last left
  Paris.'</p>

  <p>Her thoughts clung to him. On this very couch they had sat when he had
  come for his farewell. She recalled his damp hands, his hollow face, his
  stooping shoulders, his desperate hopefulness, mocked by the haunted,
  reproachful look in his great eyes, the bitter fiction they had kept up: 'I
  shall return&mdash;I shall be faithful&mdash;We will be happy'&mdash;cheating
  themselves by the perfume of these poor flowerets of sentiment into ignoring
  the abyss of eternal separation that was opening between them.</p>

  <p>Separation of the body, of the spirit, no, for he was ever present. To
  escape the spectre of her lover, who appeared to her sometimes in his rich
  dress as he had lived, sometimes in clinging grave clothes, but always under
  an aspect of horror, Julie had only two resources&mdash;opium and M. de
  Guibert; and the ghastly face of the dead man often mocked the drug-given
  sleep and distracted her amid the caresses of the traitor for whom she had
  betrayed love.</p>

  <p>She felt that if he had lived he would have forgiven her; but that as he
  was dead he regarded her without pity. She thought of his long agony in the
  foreign wayside inn, the doubts and suspicions that had troubled his last
  moments...his intense loneliness...his unutterable failure.</p>

  <p>If she must die the same way it was a punishment from which she would not
  flinch; yet she wished that she had been able to make the prompt expiation
  her soul had indicated. How had Jacques de Guibert dared to garrot her to a
  life he rendered intolerable?</p>

  <p>Well, she would be free of him now; she would content herself with his
  friendship to soften the haunted dreariness of her life, and she would
  dedicate herself anew to death&mdash;the long, slow death that M. de Mora had
  suffered.</p>

  <p>She could now gauge his torture by the measure of her own, and she was
  twice amazed at the strength of will that had forced the dying body to that
  last journey.</p>

  <p>She picked up her chatelaine and looked at the two little hearts hanging
  there&mdash;one of gold, one with that tress of dark, Southern hair. She felt
  that she had never ceased to love him and her infidelity appeared to her as
  absurd as it was monstrous.</p>

  <p>Her own actions seemed incredible, exactly like the hallucination of an
  evil dream. It was impossible that she who had always preserved so immaculate
  her womanly reticence, her inner reserve, her proud self-respect, even
  through the transports of a passionate love affair, should have given herself
  so easily to one who was not even her friend&mdash;who never could be.</p>

  <p>Her self-contempt, her remorse, poisoned memories that should have been
  magic; the music of <i>Le Devin du Village</i> she recalled as the wail of
  lost spirits; the rosy glow from the pink-shaded candles in the room behind
  the box at the opera like a reflection from the bottomless pit. Infidel as
  she was, she found no difficulty in believing in Hell.</p>

  <p>But now she was calm; she told herself again and again that she was calm.
  Was it not easy to be so when the term of her life was to be so short?</p>

  <p>She tried to detach her thoughts from the all-pervading image of Jacques
  de Guibert, and to think of the others&mdash;shadowy figures
  these!&mdash;whom she must leave behind; she who had such a genius for
  friendship thought dully now of her wonderful friends: Jean D'Alembert, whose
  life was based on such a tragic misunderstanding; Madame Geoffrin, her loving
  benefactor; old now and ill herself; Madame de Chatillon, whose tender
  kindness had moved a response from Julie; the good Condorcet; Caraccioli,
  Chastellux, Marmontel, Suard, La Harpe, M, de Crillon, M. de Vaines, M. de
  Saint Chamans all these dear friends who had made life so rich to Julie she
  could now leave without a pang. Neither their love, their wit, their
  laughter, nor their need of her could lighten that dreary, melancholy desert
  where her soul dwelt. She thought of them with a faint surprise that they had
  ever interested her; only for D'Alembert and Madame Geoffrin did she feel any
  stir of affection.</p>

  <p>'I suppose,' she said to herself, 'this is what they mean by a broken
  heart.'</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

  <p class="first">During the following weeks her health steadily declined; she
  hardly left the house; those who gathered about her wondered at her calm, her
  sadness; all, save the thrice blinded D'Alembert thought that it was to do
  with the loss of M. de Mora. The knowledge of the origin of their pity was a
  further burden to Julie, and caused her to reject the consolation that might
  otherwise have soothed and strengthened.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert wrote from Montauban, where his mother was ill (Julie
  recalled when M. de Mora's mother had died the autumn before his own death,
  and shivered), from Livourne where he had gone to join the Corsican Legion,
  from other places where he gave no address, but told her to send her letters
  <i>poste restante</i>.</p>

  <p>She believed that he was with Madame de Montsauge, if there were some
  other woman she was too languid to care.</p>

  <p>She wrote to him in the language of this new 'friendship' on which she had
  fixed her last hope of calm. She promised to criticise the <i>Eloge de
  Catinat</i>, which was to be presented at the next <i>Concours</i> of the
  Academy; she repelled his more ardent protestations of affection; she
  received calmly his careless remark that his affairs were in such a state
  that there was nothing for him but a wealthy marriage. She acted the part she
  had set herself, that of a prudent, sincere friend.</p>

  <p>To her drug-taking she added another solace&mdash;music. When she could
  drag herself so far, she never failed to spend the evening in the box of one
  of her friends, listening to the voluptuous strains of <i>Flora e Pomone</i>,
  or the piercing sweetness of the melodies of Gluck.</p>

  <p>She remained more constant to her books than to her friends. Richardson,
  Sterne, Condillac, Montaigne, Racine, Voltaire, La Fontaine, Prevost, Le
  Sage, Gessner, La Motte, continued to please her; La Rochefoucauld,
  Montesquieu, Tacitus, Plutarch, these were often the companions of her
  voluntary loneliness, and served to maintain the heroic exaltation of her
  mood.</p>

  <p>'I dare not desire your return, but I count the days of your absence,' she
  wrote to M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>He took little heed of her new resolution. He believed that as soon as she
  saw him she would fall into his arms, be at his feet&mdash;she had done so
  before.</p>

  <p>But on his return to Paris in November he found a changed Julie. She was
  calm&mdash;there were neither tears nor complaints nor protestations. She
  avoided caresses; she silenced his vows. Baffled, he believed that he had
  lost her, and amid the dissipations of the capital in which he involved
  himself more deeply than ever, he was vexed and wounded by the thought of
  this incomparable woman who had been so utterly his and now was so
  inaccessible.</p>

  <p>Perversely, he decided on the reconquest of a mistress whose mere
  existence had lately been an irritation and a burden.</p>

  <p>Julie, in her pitiful courage, clung to the memory of M. de Mora, which
  was at once her comfort and her despair, and believed herself safe.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

  <p class="first">No reasoning made any impression on Julie. She remained
  serene in her new-found strength; she accorded Jacques de Guibert nothing but
  a sober friendship, and gradually she began to know some calm&mdash;an
  apathetic calm, perhaps, but easeful compared to her former tortures. She
  almost believed that the spirit of M. de Mora was appeased; though the vision
  of him never ceased to haunt her, he appeared to her now under an aspect less
  ghastly, less full of horror. And that she was able to make this resistance
  was as balm to her wounded pride, her lacerated self-respect. She could not
  lose her overwhelming sorrow, but she regained some dignity and repose; she
  was no longer tormented by jealousy: the life led by M. de Guibert caused her
  only an impersonal regret; his presence was as necessary to her as ever but
  not his constancy.</p>

  <p>In an exalted mood she waited for death, concentrating her thoughts on
  this expiation, not knowing that the hour was not yet and that her sufferings
  were not to be ended so easily. M. de Guibert paid her more attention than he
  had done when he was sure of her; apart from his pique at her coldness, he
  fell again under the spell of the woman whom so many had named
  'enchantress.'</p>

  <p>Nearly every day found him, either morning or evening, in the little red
  <i>salon</i> where Julie, too languid now to go out much, passed long days
  with her books, her needlework, her dogs, and her paroquet.</p>

  <p>The Utrecht velvet ottoman was drawn close to the fire, and often she
  never moved from it by the day together, sometimes her cough, the pain in her
  chest, or her headache would be so bad that she denied herself even to M. de
  Guibert and remained prostrate for hours, conscious of nothing but her
  physical distress. And always when she rallied from these attacks there
  appeared to her the pale image of M. de Mora languishing in that agony of
  which her own seemed a reflection.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert tried to induce her to see M. Lorry and to give up her
  increasing habit of opium-taking, always without result. One day when he
  found her very feeble from the effect of an enormous dose of the drug, he
  reproached her folly with a force that was nearly anger.</p>

  <p>'You must know my history, <i>mon ami</i>,' she replied languidly, 'before
  you condemn me. How little you do know about me, after all.'</p>

  <p>He considered her with frank and troubled eyes. She was further removed
  than ever from his comprehension; part of her fascination for him was that
  she kept him in a continual state of wonder and slight bewilderment. She was
  so different from all the women whom he had ever known, or imagined, or heard
  of.</p>

  <p>Julie raised herself on her elbow; the firelight gave a false rosiness to
  her haggard face, the voluminous dress of Mexican muslin, striped gray and
  white, her frilled and ruffled lawn fichu and elbow flounces disguised the
  emaciation of her figure. Twisted round her shoulders was a scarf of white
  gauze with black satin stripes; a large mob-cap of blonde lace concealed her
  hair. Her piquant face had become sharp in outline, but had lost nothing of
  the charm of its changing expression. She did not look at M. de Guibert, but
  into the fire where she had so often traced her castles in Spain.</p>

  <p>'Some day, <i>mon ami</i>,' she said quietly, 'I will tell you things that
  you will not find either in Prévost or Richardson. My history is composed of
  circumstances so terrible, so atrocious, that it proves that nothing seems
  more improbable than the truth. We hear little of the childhood of the
  heroines of romance&mdash;mine was singular enough to deserve to be
  remembered! Some evening this winter, when we are sad enough and thoughtful
  enough, I will give you the pastime of hearing a story that would interest
  you if you found it in a book, but will make you conceive a horror for the
  human species. The cruelty of men! Tigers are gentle compared to them!' She
  shivered and bent closer over the fire. 'I should have devoted myself to
  hatred. I have badly fulfilled my destiny, for I have loved much and hated
  very little. <i>Mon Dieu</i> it is as if I had lived a hundred years...My
  life, that appears so uniform, so monotonous, has known all misfortunes. I
  have been a victim of all the wicked passions that can animate men.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert was moved. He knew that she referred to her unhappy origin,
  the mystery of which was so well-guarded that he had never been able to
  discover the truth.</p>

  <p>'But you remain on friendly terms with the D'Albon?' he asked</p>

  <p>Julie flashed him an angry look. 'Who told you that I was a demoiselle
  D'Albon?'</p>

  <p>He stood his ground before her haughtiness. 'Some of your letters have the
  D'Albon seal and, pardon me, <i>mon amie</i>, but so much is common knowledge
  among your friends.'</p>

  <p>'You know no more?</p>

  <p>'No more.'</p>

  <p>'Seek to probe no further,' she said. 'There are horrors! With my
  family'&mdash;she spoke the word proudly&mdash;'I keep up the commerce of
  civility. One only I love&mdash;Abel de Vichy. He knows the truth, and since
  the day that he wrung it from his mother he has overwhelmed me with devotion
  and tenderness.'</p>

  <p>'And the others?'</p>

  <p>'As long as I ask nothing, <i>mon amie</i>, the others are quiet.' She
  spoke with a profound and bitter indifference. 'Do not believe,' she added,
  'that I have not pressed my claims because of respect to them, but only
  because I cared nothing about it and had my mind full of other things.'</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a smile and quickly changed the subject: 'Have you
  read the <i>L'Eloge de Despreaux</i>? It is worthy of D'Alembert.'</p>

  <p>'I have read it and am assured of its success.'</p>

  <p>'He is the first of our philosophers, the first of our men of letters,'
  said Julie, warmly.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert agreed, with generous enthusiasm. 'You are right, because he
  practises what he speaks. His goodness, his nobility, his disinterestedness
  have no equal.'</p>

  <p>Julie gave him a strange look. 'He is indeed the best of men,' she
  added.</p>

  <p>Both were silent, but so strong was one thought in both their minds that
  it was as if each said: 'And the most credulous.'</p>

  <p>Julie shivered, and M. de Guibert, with that tactlessness that sat so
  strangely on a man of his breed, said firmly: 'I consider him superior to M.
  de Voltaire, whose spirit I detest as much as I admire his genius, and whose
  dry soul is not to be compared to that of M. D'Alembert. I am only sorry that
  I could not see him oftener. I hope that you keep a warm spot for me in his
  heart.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon ami</i>,' said Julie quietly, 'do you think that I need to hear of
  M. D'Alembert's virtues from you?'</p>

  <p>He flushed. 'Do you mean to reprove me? Can I never please you?'</p>

  <p>She smiled faintly. 'I only thought that M. de Mora would never have said
  those words.</p>

  <p>'Must you always put M. de Mora between us?'</p>

  <p>'The logic of the heart is absurd,' smiled Julie. 'Have I not always been
  impossible?'</p>

  <p>'You are sad!...and when every one is swept away by an intoxication of
  happiness!'</p>

  <p>'I know. M. de Crillon has written me three pages&mdash;a patriotic hymn
  from Montigny. But I? Is my heart to cease to ache because M. Turgot is
  Controller-General?'</p>

  <p>She turned towards M. de Guibert and spoke with sudden force. 'Why do you
  spend your time with this sick woman when France is afire with these great
  events? Find an occupation more suitable to your youth and genius, <i>mon
  ami</i>.'</p>

  <p>'Julie,' he said boldly, 'I love you.'</p>

  <p>He rose and leant against the mantelpiece, looking down at her with
  masterful eyes.</p>

  <p>He was more richly dressed than formerly, more assured, more the courtier,
  less the soldier. The life of Paris had robbed him of that freshness of early
  youth, that bloom of perfect health, but the charm of his delightful
  personality remained unaltered.</p>

  <p>Julie looked up at him. He made a movement towards her. She held out her
  frail hand to keep him away.</p>

  <p>'Tell me of the <i>L'Eloge de Catinat</i>,' she said quickly. He accepted
  his rebuff quietly.</p>

  <p>'I am annoyed that the other biography is to appear,' lie remarked. 'It
  takes the novelty from the subject which had never been treated before.'</p>

  <p>'But yours is better,' said Julie, in a calm tone. 'You have certainly
  nothing to fear from this man Turpin, but possibly something from the rivalry
  of La Harpe.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert glanced at her with growing vexation; he was becoming
  unbearably inflamed by her serenity.</p>

  <p>'Let us leave off talking of Catinat,' he said almost roughly.</p>

  <p>Julie took him up swiftly. 'Shall we talk of <i>Les Gracques</i>, or the
  visit of the Archduke, or the recall of the exiles from Chanteloup and the
  joy of Madame du Deffand?'</p>

  <p>He refused any longer to bow to her mood.</p>

  <p>'You may discuss these matters with any one,' he replied, 'there is no
  need that you should endure my company for such a conversation.'</p>

  <p>Julie moved restlessly on her couch. She coughed a little and put her
  hands to her painful breast.</p>

  <p>'Will you come to the opera with me to-night?' asked M. de Guibert, fixing
  on her his powerful glance.</p>

  <p>Julie shook her head.</p>

  <p>'There is your new Italian, Mellico; you admire him?'</p>

  <p>'I will not come to-night.'</p>

  <p>'They are giving <i>Le Divin du Village</i>.'</p>

  <p>She started and her baited glance met his. 'And you ask me to see
  that&mdash;with you!</p>

  <p>'Why not? I remember it very ill. I heard but little of the music. It
  hardly penetrates to that delicious little <i>salon</i> behind the box.'</p>

  <p>He smiled very winningly and held out his small, shapely hand, adding,
  while she was breathlessly shrinking from him,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Julie, Julie! will you never be happy? Must you always analyse and
  probe&mdash;be torn with remorse and regret? For what fault? Be always
  haunted with spectres and phantoms&mdash;for what crime? Ah, <i>mon
  amie</i>'&mdash;his voice fell to notes of great tenderness&mdash;'can you
  not love me save in half-measures?'</p>

  <p>She laughed desperately. 'Love you&mdash;in half measures?'</p>

  <p>'Ay; do you not turn to me but to escape the spectre of M. de Mora? Is not
  your soul&mdash;your mind full of him?'</p>

  <p>'Can I forget a man whose death I caused?' murmured Julie, terribly shaken
  from her calm.</p>

  <p>You torture yourself for nothing,' replied M. de Guibert with the contempt
  of the healthy-minded for the morbid. 'The consul at Bordeaux assured me that
  he would have died as soon even if he had stayed in Madrid. He was dying for
  years&mdash;certainly doomed when he left Paris.'</p>

  <p>'All this cannot one jot remove the weight from my heart,' said Julie,
  moving restlessly on the couch and clutching at the red cushions. 'I know his
  worth; I know how he loved me.'</p>

  <p>'You know how I love you.'</p>

  <p>Julie moved her head from side to side like one trying to escape from
  intolerable pain. She was ghastly in her colourlessness. Her eyes looked
  unnatural in their size and lustre.</p>

  <p>'Why do you not leave me alone? Why detach me from my sole comfort? Ha,
  why? For you do not love me...that would be the sole excuse...but you do not
  love me.'</p>

  <p>He leant forward and took her quivering, chill hands in his strong, warm
  fingers. 'What is your comfort, Julie?'</p>

  <p>'Death,' she answered, her hoarse voice almost extinct with pain. 'Do you
  not see that I am dedicated to death? That I have no other thought&mdash;no
  other idea? Once you forced me to live; now it is beyond your power.'</p>

  <p>He still retained her hands. 'You to talk of death! You so sweetly alive!
  I cannot think of you and death, Julie.'</p>

  <p>His smile expressed an affectionate contempt for her sombre speech.
  '<i>Mon Dieu</i> these funereal ideas!</p>

  <p>Live, <i>mon amie</i>, live! Are there not things that can make life dear
  to you?'</p>

  <p>He let go her hands, sank on the ottoman beside her and caught her to him
  with a gentle firmness.</p>

  <p>'Repulse me now,' he said, with a warm laugh.</p>

  <p>His irresistible attraction encompassed her like warmth to the frozen,
  light to the blind, the breath of life to the dying. She felt the old flame
  flicker in her heart and burn away her hard-won repose; but pride and shame
  and despair were still strong in her, and she resisted this extraordinary
  influence, invoking with a shudder of agony the spectre of her dead lover,
  straining away from the embrace of M. de Guibert and burying her face in the
  cushions.</p>

  <p>He kissed the thin line of her neck and all her ardent nature responded
  with a shock of joy. It seemed to her that her heart was singing within her:
  'At last at last!' Still she struggled, as she had struggled again and again
  to resist the opium bottle.</p>

  <p>'You shame me bitterly!' came her stifled voice. 'At least have pity.'</p>

  <p>He laughed and continued to kiss her neck.</p>

  <p>Julie lay passive. She had been so brave; for a whole month her courage
  had not faltered; she had been so calm, so serene in her certainty of death:
  M. de Mora had ceased to gaze at her with eyes so reproachful; Madame de
  Montsauge had ceased to torment her. Was all this to be lost in one moment's
  weakness?</p>

  <p>She raised her head and struggled away from him. Her face was now flushed
  with a hectic colour, like the bloom of a wild rose.</p>

  <p>'I will not listen,' she murmured. 'I have no need of you. Will you not
  leave me? You were never my friend.'</p>

  <p>For answer she felt his firm, warm face on hers, and he had caught her by
  the shoulders and kissed her mouth. And she returned the kiss and clung to
  him, then dragged herself away with a sound that was like a wail.</p>

  <p>But he caught her again, the blood staining his face and thick neck and
  flushing his eyes. When he exerted only the half of his strength her utmost
  struggles were vain.</p>

  <p>'I hoped never to know this again,' breathed Julie, helpless in his
  embrace. 'You have overcome; only tell me that you love me...Ha, <i>mon
  Dieu!</i>'</p>

  <p>Her head fell forward on to the laces at his heart, and he looked over her
  bowed, shamed figure with a smile of unconscious triumph.</p>

  <p>'Only tell me that you love me,' muttered the unfortunate mature, clinging
  to him frantically.</p>

  <p>He did not think that he was false when he answered, 'Yes'; for that
  moment at least it was true...<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The autumn afternoon faded unnoticed; the fire sank to a glowing heap of
  ashes, unheeded; shadows began to obscure the well-worn, elegant furniture,
  the mirror that had reflected M. de Mora, the alabaster bird against which
  Julie had leant to watch him drive away, the bust of M. D'Alembert, patient,
  credulous, the bust of Voltaire, alert, ironic, the desk where only yesterday
  she had written a letter to the dead man...</p>

  <p>When he left her to go and sup with a cheerful mind in Madame de
  Bouffler's <i>salon</i>, Julie crept to her bedroom. She looked quite
  old.</p>

  <p>There was no exaltation now, no radiancy, no passionate joy in love
  renewed; nothing but utter wretchedness and shame, bitter self-contempt and
  abject humiliation.</p>

  <p>She picked up a hand mirror and stared at herself as if she expected to
  see the marks of his kisses like brands upon her face.</p>

  <p>'How vile I am!' she muttered. 'How vile!'</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

  <p class="first">The disastrous love of Julie de Lespinasse became now more
  terrible, she had left neither pride nor self-respect, she could not reproach
  the man whom she could not resist. She had no hold on him, no claim, for he
  had reduced her to accept with thankfulness even a portion of his regard.
  Once he had again overcome her resolution to escape, he became indifferent,
  difficult to bring to an appointment, fertile in excuses for leaving her,
  absorbed in a hundred other interests, careless of the little attentions and
  considerations for which Julie's wounded heart was so avid.</p>

  <p>She sank into a state of ironic resignation, broken by only occasional
  complaints.</p>

  <p>'Death would be my only solace,' she told him, 'twice you have taken it
  from me, and now I have no longer the activity of soul to seek it.' She
  calmed her burning pain with opium and the opera; night after night found her
  listening to <i>Orfeo</i>. The sad, lovely music fascinated her beyond words
  and moved her to those tears that saved her heart from utterly breaking.</p>

  <p>She moved among her friends like a phantom of herself, barely able to
  force an interest in anything save it concerned Jacques de Guibert. She had
  to endure his renewed intimacy with Madame de Montsauge&mdash;'friendship' he
  called it. She remembered how she had used the word and detested it. 'There
  is only one thing possible between a man and a woman, and its name is not
  friendship.'</p>

  <p>Evening after evening she waited for him and he did not come. Time after
  time she looked for him at the opera or the Comédie in vain. Again and again
  he lost an opportunity of being with her, either through design or
  carelessness.</p>

  <p>'You have more affairs on hand than Providence,' Julie wrote to him after
  a long neglect, 'and I must say with the Cannanite, "I am content with the
  crumbs that drop from my master's table"; but, <i>mon ami</i>, this Biblical
  humility is of a baseness that only a Christian can endure, and I, who do not
  aspire to heaven, will not in this life nourish myself with any one's
  leavings.' Then he would turn to her again, and an hour of joy would annul
  weeks of pain, and she would be at his feet, adoring him, willing to endure
  any torture for an occasional caress.</p>

  <p>He was her despair, her agony, her humiliation, but he was the one thing
  that kept her attached to life. All the thousand other interests in her
  existence would not have held her a single day. He, and he only, distracted
  her from the death she longed for.</p>

  <p>'It is strange to adore that which one knows is not a god,' she said, in
  bitter self-contempt. She continued to write to the man whose spectre haunted
  her day and night. To escape the living man she cast herself into the arms of
  the dead. To free herself from the dead, she turned frantically to the
  living, not knowing which agony was the greater to endure: the still phantom
  of the lover who had loved her too well, or the virile presence of the lover
  who did not love her enough.</p>

  <p>The ceaseless devotion of D'Alembert, of Madame Chatillon, of Madame
  Geoffrin, the affection and solicitude of her numberless friends, had now no
  value at all for Julie, save as an occasional anodyne against her unceasing
  pain. The brilliant, charming people among whom she had passed her life, now
  appeared to her as the dullest of fools. Every emotion seemed trivial in
  comparison with the violent passion that was consuming her. Her entire being,
  her health and happiness, were dependent on the treatment she received from a
  man too engrossed in a thousand pursuits to be always careful how he pleased,
  and too selfish to always notice how he wounded.</p>

  <p>He lost his muff (that she suspected to be a woman's gift) and she sent
  him another; he returned it with a note saying it was too costly for him to
  accept, that he should lose it; Julie was moved by this awkward
  ungraciousness into a retort, pathetic in its openheartedness.</p>

  <p>'With me such excuses are banal and stupid,' she wrote. 'Be easy, the fact
  that I have given it to you is a proof that it is not valuable. I return it
  to you&mdash;keep it, if for no other reason not to let my lackey know the
  cause of our quarrels!'</p>

  <p>He hurt her in another way; he left the rue Taranne, in the Quartier
  Saint-Germain near to Julie, and took apartments in the Hotel de Make, rue de
  Traversière, some distance away; then she was sure that he was careless with
  her letters; she had given him a blue morocco portfolio to keep them in, but
  she often found them in his pockets or saw them loose in his desk, and she
  was frantic in her attempts to recover them, demands that he always took as
  an insult, and although she no longer allowed herself the right or could find
  in herself the courage to reproach violently or upbraid him for the
  scantiness of the affection that she had been forced to accept, often her woe
  escaped her in murmurs of ironic revolt.</p>

  <p>'You make a mystery of your doings,' she told him one evening, 'but this
  week I have divined them&mdash;shall I tell you?'</p>

  <p>He was restive and rather unhappy under her vivid scrutiny; he looked
  oppressed and his fresh complexion was pale; his appearance was no longer
  that of a man in his first youth; he leant over the back of one of the tall
  chairs and stared into the great fire.</p>

  <p>'To-morrow,' continued Julie in the same tone of sarcasm, 'you go out at
  eleven, you pay visits in the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, you dine with Madame de
  Boufflers, at five you are with M. de Crillon, you go home and write to
  Madame de Vaines, at seven you go to the Comédie Française to see Henri IV.,
  which is the second piece, you ask for the box of M. d'Aumont&mdash;at eight,
  without wasting a minute, you leave and go to supper with Madame de
  Montsauge.'</p>

  <p>'Do you spy on my movements?' asked M. de Guibert irritably.</p>

  <p>Her gleaming, jealous glance swept over his magnificent figure in the
  peacock blue velvet with the silver lace and paste buttons; the fire-glow was
  full on his angry, charming face, powdered and patched now, and on his waved,
  rolled, and pomaded hair.</p>

  <p>'Will you hear the rest of the programme?' she demanded. 'Monday, dinner
  with M. de Vaines and supper with Madame de Montsauge. Tuesday, dinner at the
  "Controle General" and supper with Madame de Montsauge. Wednesday, dinner
  with Madame de Geoffrin and supper with Madame de Montsauge. Thursday, dinner
  with M. de Crillon and supper with Madame de Montsauge. Friday, dinner with
  Madame de Chatillon and supper with Madame de Montsauge. Saturday, dine with
  Madame de Montsauge and go to Versailles, return Sunday evening to dine with
  me&mdash;does it not please you, this programme?</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i> I' he replied impatiently, 'you put poison and steel into
  everything.'</p>

  <p>'Nay,' she replied quietly, 'I have not the strength for tragedy. I am
  even too sad and too weak to tell you how much I love you.' She closed her
  eyes and leant back against the corner of the ottoman that had now become her
  habitual couch.</p>

  <p>'There are your letters,' said M. de Guibert, laying a packet on the table
  by her side. 'Even to that which asked for their return&mdash;here is the
  garter you asked for&mdash;I believe that I shall never forgive the spirit
  that made these demands.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon ami</i>,' said Julie in a quivering voice one should pardon
  everything to the fools, the sick, and the unhappy.'</p>

  <p>'You have never been a fool,' retorted M. de Guibert, 'and it is your own
  fault if you are sick and unhappy. <i>Mon Dieu</i> I know not either how to
  understand you or deal with you, you turn all to tragedy, to tears and
  terror, you evoke ghosts and live among funeral images. Your life should be
  radiant.'</p>

  <p>'Ah! You do not understand, indeed,' murmured Julie, opening full her
  tired eyes, now blurred with tears; her hoarse voice sank lower. 'And,
  therefore, I do not reproach you, for you know not the wrong you have
  done&mdash;as for me, do you not see that all my contradictions are explained
  in the three words&mdash;I love you!'</p>

  <p>He lowered his glance uneasily. 'And yet you will not let me make you
  happy.'</p>

  <p>'You keep me alive,' smiled Julie wistfully. 'If you could see me on the
  days you do not come you would pity me. I listen for every passing
  carriage&mdash;is it he? For every knock&mdash;is it from him? Ah, the long
  waitings, the fainting hopes, <i>mon ami</i>. Pity! Ha Indeed I am sunk
  beneath anything but pity.'</p>

  <p>'I come when I can, my engagements...' he began awkwardly</p>

  <p>Julie cut him short. 'You quote "engagements" to me I I who have loved you
  with such abandon that I have sacrificed all I held sacred, even my tears,
  even my desire for death, to you! I, too, have friends and interests,
  position and fame&mdash;these have gone down the wind for you&mdash;and in
  return you throw me a little of your spare time!' She smiled bitterly,
  staring at him with a look he did not care to meet. His chest heaved and his
  fingers played restlessly on the back of the chair as he answered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Even as you speak, you know that you are unjust. But I pardon your
  moods.'</p>

  <p>Again Julie interrupted him, this time fiercely</p>

  <p>'You pardon me&mdash;and for what crime? These words to me!&mdash;M. de
  Mora is avenged indeed, that after his perfect love I must endure this!' She
  rose as she spoke and stood erect, an emaciated and pallid figure in her
  black silk gown and white lace, but vivid, powerful, and beautiful in the
  sheer force of her passion and vitality.</p>

  <p>'You quote too often M. de Mora,' said M. de Guibert, the slow colour
  mounting to his face and neck. 'Remember that he could not hold you.'</p>

  <p>Julie quivered and threw out her hand as if to ward off an offensive
  presence. 'Go to Madame de Montsauge,' she muttered. 'She will be the better
  company.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert flamed into a rare fury. '<i>Mon Dieu</i> how intolerable is
  this jealousy, am I never to have done with it? You have nothing to fear from
  the lady with whom you torment me.'</p>

  <p>'There is another,' said Julie instantly.</p>

  <p>'And if there is?' he flared, '<i>Grand Dieux</i>, am I not my own
  master?'</p>

  <p>Julie stared at him in sheer terror. 'Then you are concealing something
  from me,' she stammered, 'I knew it...these visits...your obstinate
  silence...your evasions...tell me.'</p>

  <p>'I will tell nothing to one who acts the fury on the least excuse,' he
  answered hotly; his masculine pride and arrogance were now fully mused and he
  turned on her with the impetuous anger of one who strikes from his path an
  irritating impediment. 'My time and my actions are my own...I have suffered
  too much...I am not responsible for your tortures or your rages...You have
  made your own limbo and must suffer in it alone...<i>Mon Dieu</i>, is life to
  be wasted in these perpetual recriminations?' He snatched up his hat and was
  violently leaving her, but the wretched woman, who by his words was goaded
  into desperation, impetuously caught his sleeve.</p>

  <p>'Only be frank with me, tell me the truth,' she implored. He tried to
  escape her and she fell to her knees clutching at his reluctant hand. 'The
  truth!' she almost shrieked.</p>

  <p>He was repelled, not softened, by her utter humiliation; a faint shame
  struggled in him with an intense desire to be rid of her; the whole situation
  had become utterly hateful.</p>

  <p>'I will see you when you are calmer,' he muttered, pulled his hand free
  and went swiftly, leaving her kneeling in the centre of the room.</p>

  <p>Julie staggered to her feet and attempted to go after him, heard the door
  close and fell back, clutching at the back of the ottoman. She began to laugh
  and then to cough; her body was shaken with a slight convulsion; she turned
  and stared at herself in the gilt mirror. A fever coloured her lips and
  cheeks with a false look of health, a deep pain tore at her chest; she was
  giddy and sick and feeble, but her tremendous energy kept her erect.</p>

  <p>It was still early. Julie, in the mood of a hunted creature looking for a
  hole, thought she would go to see Madame Chatillon who loved her...Madame
  Chatillon who caressed her tenderly. She rang for Madame Saint-Martin who
  exclaimed at her appearance&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Mademoiselle is ill again!'</p>

  <p>'No, I am going out,' said Julie, with a ghastly smile.</p>

  <p>She took some wine and a biscuit, then went to her toilet. She selected a
  new costume, a robed la polonaise and <i>gorge de pigeon</i>; a fantastic
  fashion, that her grace carried well, in satin, striped with dark green and
  white with adjustments of blonde lace and silver ribbon. She nearly fainted
  while her hair was being dressed. She could not endure the powder in her
  throat, nor hold the horn to her face, so it was piled up in its own dark
  waves. She worried about her scarf, her gloves, her shoes...and after all she
  could not go. Her strength failed her when the moment came to descend the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>The wearisome toilet was followed by a wearisome disrobing, and at last
  she was in her white dimity bed-jacket and muslin gown, seated near the fire
  burning in her room. She insisted on Madame Saint-Martin giving her a dose of
  opium, then sent the waiting woman, silent and frightened, away. Julie stared
  down at the pile of letters on her knee, and the silver garter with the pink
  rose he had cherished and then returned to her on her insistent demand. With
  a shiver she cast the delicate trifle into the flames. She meant to send the
  letters after it, but something more powerful than herself restrained her,
  and presently she made an effort and rose feebly, and somehow crawled to her
  desk, and locked them away with the others he had sent back in impetuous
  anger, put them away in the rose-coloured portfolio with those other letters
  of hers the doctor had returned from Bordeaux&mdash;all with that little seal
  of the seated cat, save one or two proudly set with the arms of D'Albon in a
  lozenge. She stared at one of them. 'Ha!' she thought, 'had I been Julie
  D'Albon, or Julie de Vichy, things had not gone like this with me.'</p>

  <p>She locked the portfolio, and sat down at her desk. She meant to write to
  M. de Mora, to tell him of her suffering, her punishment, her remorse, her
  love.</p>

  <p>The little gilt clock on the mantelpiece struck twelve. Julie put down the
  pen; her glance fell on the bins calendar hanging before her. The
  candle-light illuminated the date&mdash;February the twelfth. Her soul froze
  within her. A year ago at this very hour, M. de Mora had been dying in
  Madrid, and she had been in the arms of Jacques de Guibert, forgetful of
  everything save the music, the rosy lights, the delicate warmth, the perfumed
  poison she was drinking&mdash;the delicious poison that even now circled in
  her veins.</p>

  <p>She turned in her chair and stared over her shoulder. Still and empty was
  the crimson bed-chamber in the fire and candle-light, the bed shadowed in the
  alcove, the door closed. Her head was giddy with the opium and the horror of
  her recollections. A year ago! a year ago...</p>

  <p>She held on to the back of the tapestry chair staring, staring. The figure
  of a young man appeared before her, radiant with love and tenderness.
  Seductive words were on his warm lips, his fresh face had all the bloom of
  first youth. He turned to her the features of Jacques de Guibert...even as
  she stared he changed, faded, grew pale, stern, and cold; the fair locks
  darkening to black tresses&mdash;the face of the dead gazed with living eyes
  from above the stiff folds of a shroud. 'Who are you?' murmured Julie.</p>

  <p>'I am your fate,' breathed the phantom, and vanished into the shadows
  slowly, as the echo of a sigh.</p>

  <p>Julie stood motionless, holding on to the back of the tapestry chair,
  staring, staring.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch28"
     id="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">Passionate, desperate letter following passionate, desperate
  letter failed to elicit any response from M. de Guibert, who sought the usual
  refuge of a good-natured, vexed man in a difficulty&mdash;silence.</p>

  <p>Julie, more and more agitated, suspected that something fatal to her
  happiness was being concealed behind this obstinate resistance.</p>

  <p>'What must I do to merit the truth?' she wrote to him. 'Tell me; I shall
  find nothing impossible. Listen to your own heart and cease to agonise
  mine...esteem me enough to be frank with me. I vow, by all that is most dear
  to me, never to give you cause to repent having told me the truth...I have
  taken from you all excuse to deceive me; if you continue to do so you will be
  shameless.'</p>

  <p>The evening of the day he received this letter, he came to her; Julie was
  going to the 'Comédie to see <i>Tom Jones</i> and <i>La Fause Magic</i>, and
  Madame de Chatillon and M. de Crillon were with her. She could scarcely
  conceal her agitation at seeing her lover again, her distress at having to
  meet him before witnesses.</p>

  <p>He was distracted, careless, hardly gracious; he refused to go to the
  theatre. He said he had come for <i>L'Eloge de la Raison</i> that she had
  promised him. Julie bade her Mends go without her while she stayed behind to
  look for the <i>brochure</i>. As soon as they were alone, she turned on him
  with a mingled agitated joy at the sight of him and a quivering indignation
  at his behaviour.</p>

  <p>'Must you flout my friends?' she demanded. 'But truly, it is useless to
  speak. You have not the manners or the tone of any ordinary mortal&mdash;you
  are like God, infinitely perfect, and I doubt not no less self-satisfied and
  happy. Any one of such a magnificence could only change to
  lose&mdash;doubtless Alexander had no gift for the civilities. Preserve,
  then, <i>mon ami</i>, your haughty manners and your total disregard of all
  that which pleases and interests those whom you say you love.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert looked sulky; he deliberately glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>'I am pressed for time. I could not come to the Comédie.</p>

  <p>'Why did you come here at all?' demanded Julie sarcastically.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i> I Have you not insisted on an explanation&mdash;an
  interview?'</p>

  <p>Julie shrank away from him.</p>

  <p>'You put it like that? <i>Mon ami</i>, it is nearly a month since I have
  seen you, and this is your greeting.'</p>

  <p>She rested her elbow on the mantelpiece and took her brow in her hand, and
  the mellow firelight glowed on her white satin hooped gown, her white satin
  jacket with the cowled hood drawn over her powdered hair; the hand that hung
  by her side still mechanically held her long, white gloves and her blue fox
  muff. She shivered, and now and then her entire body was shaken by a
  suppressed cough. M. de Guibert regarded her with confusion and vexation; he
  had not taken off his dark overcoat or even his gloves; he carried his gold
  gallooned hat under his arm; his firm, delightful face, set now in unusual
  lines of anger and framed in elaborate pomaded curls, was thrown up dearly
  against the shadows of the background.</p>

  <p>'Well?' said Julie, without moving.</p>

  <p>'What,' he asked, awkwardly, 'are you expecting?'</p>

  <p>'The truth.'</p>

  <p>She moved abruptly, sat down on the ottoman, flung away her gloves and
  muff and snatched up a green silk hand-screen, which she held between her
  pallid face and the fire. M. de Guibert took a turn about the crowded little
  room. His was the angry agitation of the man faced with a situation
  unavoidable and entirely disagreeable. Meanwhile, Julie's wrath was dying, as
  it always did under the charm of his presence.</p>

  <p>Her great eyes followed his movements with eager tenderness; she began to
  forget all her wrongs in the sheer joy of his presence...after so long. 'How
  I love you,' her heart kept saying, 'how I love you.'</p>

  <p>At last he stopped before her and looked at her reluctantly and
  apprehensively.</p>

  <p>'You must know!' he said, 'and I must tell you&mdash;my father comes to
  Paris next month.' He paused and glanced away, frowning.</p>

  <p>Julie dropped the hand-screen.</p>

  <p>'Well?' she breathed.</p>

  <p>'My father comes to arrange my marriage.' Julie was hysterically
  incredulous.</p>

  <p>'This is nothing new&mdash;you spoke of this before. <i>Mon Dieu</i> the
  stale project!'</p>

  <p>'But this is settled&mdash;the date fixed.'</p>

  <p>'The date?'</p>

  <p>'In May, I think, or June.'</p>

  <p>'Ah,' added Julie vaguely, 'the date fixed in May or June.'</p>

  <p>Encouraged by her quiet reception of his secret, M. de Guibert assumed a
  more natural manner. He took one of her passive hands and kissed it with an
  air of gratitude.</p>

  <p>'You know,' he said, with an eager tenderness, 'that this had to
  be&mdash;my family, my debts, my position&mdash;<i>eh bien</i>! what is
  marriage&mdash;this will make no difference.'</p>

  <p>Julie did not seem to hear this rapid self-justification.</p>

  <p>'Who is the person?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Mademoiselle Boutinon des Hayes de Courcelles.'</p>

  <p>'I do not know her&mdash;young?'</p>

  <p>'Eighteen years.'</p>

  <p>'Eighteen years! Rich?'</p>

  <p>'Rich, and of good birth and intelligent. Have I done well? You see, I
  want your approbation&mdash;my family are pleased, but your good opinion is
  more to me.'</p>

  <p>Julie rose and put her hands to her head as if she had received a stunning
  blow there. A low cry broke from her dry lips.</p>

  <p>'We can no longer love each other!' Instantly she added, 'I can no longer
  live.'</p>

  <p>Her dazed eyes turned on him with a stare of agony that was beyond
  reproach.</p>

  <p>'Julie!' he cried desperately, 'do not take it like this. <i>Mon Dieu</i>!
  but there is no need; this is a mere <i>mariage de convenance</i>, a girl
  from a convent&mdash;if you knew my debts.'</p>

  <p>'Leave me,' said Julie dully. 'I am so tired. It seems to me that I have
  no longer the strength even to die.</p>

  <p>She sank to her knees by the ottoman and dropped her poor head on to the
  red cushions. He bent over her in real distress.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon ami</i>, promise me that you will not suffer.' She raised a
  tearless and distorted face.</p>

  <p>'Promise you? I can promise nothing, but nothing at all! All my existence
  has rendered restraints impossible to me!' The blood suddenly rushed to her
  thin cheeks. 'Yes, you would wish me to be submissive and weak&mdash;that
  should be the character of one in my position...the abandoned mistress...but
  I am capable of everything&mdash;save submission.'</p>

  <p>She rose and faced him.</p>

  <p>'I have the strength of the martyr, perhaps of the criminal...Yes, I tell
  you, of the criminal, in the cause of love&mdash;but I find nothing in me
  that can meekly promise the sacrifice of that to which I have sacrificed
  everything.'</p>

  <p>'Then you will continue to love me?' he asked, hesitating.</p>

  <p>All her outraged pride flamed now to spurn him.</p>

  <p>'I will never touch your hand!...leave me! How can I say if I shall
  continue to love you or not, or what effect your marriage will have on me? I
  care little, for I have that relief you have before cheated me
  of&mdash;death.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Grand Dieu</i> you make of everything a tragedy.' He repeated his
  usual complaint helplessly.</p>

  <p>'Doubtless to you it is a comedy, monsieur.' Her smile was bitter as
  gall.</p>

  <p>'Julie!' he cried, 'in honest distress. 'I am not worthy of the pain I
  cause you.'</p>

  <p>'Do you think I do not know it? Not worthy, indeed! I find not one. noble
  impulse in you&mdash;I understand you as little as you understand me.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert bit his lip.</p>

  <p>'If you mean to reproach me&mdash;-?' he began.</p>

  <p>'Should I caress you?' she interrupted. 'You, who come to inflict on me
  the cruellest humiliation a woman can endure as calmly as if you were
  dismissing a chambermaid? Must I smile and thank you? Must the castoff
  mistress run to welcome the wife&mdash;this young, rich, intelligent, noble
  girl?'</p>

  <p>'This,' he replied hotly, 'was not what I expected from your friendship
  and intelligence.'</p>

  <p>And it did seem to him that she was speaking with mere vulgar invective.
  The force of passionate strength that had swept him off his balance when she
  had used it to woo, revolted him when she used it to spurn. Her broken,
  straining voice, her flashing eyes, her pallid face with the hectic red on
  the too-plainly revealed cheek-bones, her whole pose of taut anguish, her
  words of reckless wrath&mdash;all these things were antagonistic to him; he
  felt himself aggrieved personally and ashamed for her. Yet deep in his soul
  he received some gratification from the fact that she was behaving like
  this&mdash;it was balm to a conscience that had been more than a little
  uneasy lately. If Julie had wept he would certainly have been very
  uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>As it was, he merely hardened and set his fine mouth in lines of
  obstinacy. He had the courtesy to remain and listen to her, but every line of
  his stiffened figure told his distaste.</p>

  <p>Julie was exalted by the immensity of her woe; there was about her anguish
  the calm of one who has nothing more to lose.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i> she cried, 'is there no vengeance? Must one limit oneself
  to hate and to die! But all this is nothing to you...you do not know, even,
  how much I loved you...Ha! you will miss me in your life...I know how to
  love: it is not so common...Listen; M. de Mora knew what love was, and what
  did he say of mine? "You are of the climate of Lima and other women of that
  of Lapland"...and this he wrote to me from Madrid...How I have been
  loved...how fallen, how punished!'</p>

  <p>'I meant neither to deceive you nor to wrong you,' said M. de Guibert
  sullenly. 'The fate that was too strong for you overcame me also.'</p>

  <p>'You treat this as if it was a situation in a romance,' replied Julie,
  from the heights of her wrath and pain. '"Wrong," "deceit"&mdash;stock
  phrases, <i>mon ami</i>. Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>! I believe that you are so
  commonplace that you do not see anything horrible in my position! Wrong
  deceit! <i>Mon ami</i>, if you are a Lovelace I am not a Miss Harlowe, save
  inasmuch as that I shall die of what you have done to me...I have loved
  you&mdash;you will never be able to forget it&mdash;but I talk according to
  my folly, and you listen according to yours. Leave me, and believe that I
  prefer my grief to any consolation you can offer...</p>

  <p>'This is furious language!'</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i> what else do you expect from one in Hell?'</p>

  <p>The grandeur of her agony escaped him; he thought that she was acting,
  after her nature, impulsively, dramatically...soon she would be
  resigned&mdash;if not, why, he had always meant to break with her He moved
  impatiently. His rich, light dress gleamed where his coat fell apart; she saw
  his silk and lace and jewels.</p>

  <p>'You are going to some amusement,' she cried; 'after telling me this you
  are hastening away to your enjoyment, glad of an unpleasant moment lived
  through you never meant to stay!'</p>

  <p>'I cannot,' he said cruelly. 'I have to dine with Madame de
  Courcelles.'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' breathed Julie, 'that is the sort of thing you do&mdash;fling me my
  dismissal and go to fawn upon your legal love, and tell me so&mdash;I, who
  loved you!'</p>

  <p>'Forget me,' he said impatiently. 'There is nothing between us save the
  accident of our meeting. If my heart's blood could wash out the grief I have
  caused you, I would shed it. Forget me!'</p>

  <p>'How banal you are,' replied Julie. 'You say what men in your situation
  have always said. How amazed I am that I could ever have exalted you as high
  as my heart! Yes, I shall soon forget you, and M. de Mora, and my pain, and
  all the sad days and sick nights&mdash;I shall sleep well after a lifetime's
  broken slumbers&mdash;but you will not forget me so soon. I am the greatest
  thing that ever happened to you.'</p>

  <p>Uneasy, frowning, he listened. His main thought was that he would be late
  for his appointment. Julie was calm now, as a spent wave.</p>

  <p>'Good-night,' she said. 'I am not very well, and poor company.'</p>

  <p>She smiled faintly, and he thought that she was reconciled and resigned,
  and his conscience stung him into some sort of self-justification. He began
  to speak of his debts, of the insistence of his family, of Mademoiselle de
  Courcelles' dowry, of the mere business transaction the affair was...</p>

  <p>Only once did Julie interrupt him, and then it was to exclaim,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Your debts! I cost you nothing...you kept no carriage for me'</p>

  <p>When he had come to the end of his argument and his breath, she did not
  look at him nor move.</p>

  <p>Julie, Julie,' he pleaded, 'have you nothing to say?'</p>

  <p>'Good-night,' she muttered again, 'good-night.'</p>

  <p>He hesitated a moment, sighed and left her. While he descended the stairs
  he felt uneasy. As soon as he got into the street a sense of relief stole
  over him...The thing was done, and, after all, women were always the
  same&mdash;simply impossible. He looked forward with pleasure to the caresses
  and homage of the de Courcelles family, which would distract him very
  pleasantly from any painful impression this interview with Julie had left on
  his mind.</p>

  <p>Alone in the little red <i>salon</i>, Mademoiselle de Lespinasse faced her
  fate.</p>

  <p>To any woman, it would have been bitterly hard to be thus coolly abandoned
  in the very midst of a passionate love affair. To Julie it was an agony that
  stunned and overwhelmed.</p>

  <p>In no way had he spared her feelings or softened the hideous fact&mdash;a
  cowardly silence had been followed by a cruel admission. He had been
  impatient, embarrassed, vexed; abundantly had he made it clear that he did
  not love her&mdash;nay, had scarcely any regard for her; no thought of her
  had entered into his calculations&mdash;himself, his debts, his family, his
  future&mdash;always himself.</p>

  <p>Her large, impetuous nature truly despised this self-interest. All her
  instincts revolted against this plotting and scheming for self-advancement,
  for ease, for security. Had she been a queen, she would have gaily thrown
  aside her crown for love, for any wild, fatal love, as Mary of Scotland did.
  She was incapable of counting the cost, of putting anything in the balance
  against her heart. And so had been M. de Mora; he had been as young, as
  noble, as famous, as popular, as M. de Guibert, and he had never
  hesitated&mdash;he had offered marriage, he had defied his family, he had
  abandoned his career&mdash;dying, he had tried to come to her...and the man
  for whose sake she had betrayed this perfect lover was abandoning
  her&mdash;to pay his debts.</p>

  <p>She went to her room at last, not conscious of moving.</p>

  <p>Madame Saint-Martin, who had her toilet ready and the brass bath in the
  little bathroom with the blue-and-white check curtains filled with hot water,
  was frightened into tears at her mistress's appearance.</p>

  <p>'Oh, Mademoiselle, you are dying!' she blurted out.</p>

  <p>Julie smiled Her lips seemed drawn high across her teeth, her forehead
  glistened with damp; she unfastened her lace fichu and her shoulders showed
  sharp.</p>

  <p>'Yes, I am dying,' she repeated, 'but not so easily. Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>!
  how poor the light is...or I am half blind to-night.'</p>

  <p>She suddenly began coughing and fighting for her breath. She fell into the
  chair by the fireplace and suddenly thrust her kerchief to her mouth; it was
  instantly wet with a pale stain.</p>

  <p>She looked at the chamber-woman, who rushed out crying into the next room.
  M. D'Alembert had just come in. A doctor was fetched&mdash;this time not the
  'doctor of the street' to whom hitherto Julie had so obstinately clung.</p>

  <p>The great man told the shuddering D'Alembert that Mademoiselle's lungs
  were both diseased.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch29"
     id="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

  <p class="first">Julie paid no attention whatever to the opinion of the
  doctor, nor to his statement that her disease was 'spreading from her soul to
  her body' and that if she determined to recover she might easily do so.</p>

  <p>'My lungs will last longer than my heart,' she said.</p>

  <p>D'Alembert would have moved heaven and earth to have sent her away from
  the fogs of Paris to some softer climate. They neither of them had sufficient
  money, but they had friends, and D'Alembert would not have hesitated to
  write, as he had done before in a similar emergency, to Frederic of Prussia
  for the funds.</p>

  <p>But Julie could not for a moment contemplate the idea of leaving Paris.
  Now that M. de Guibert was no longer in the Faubourg St Germain, she had a
  secret desire also to leave the neighbourhood, but only that she might take
  up her residence nearer the HOtel de Matte.</p>

  <p>She had spoken to several of her friends of this vague project of changing
  her lodging, but she said nothing of it now to D'Alembert; it was not likely
  M. de Guibert would be long in the rue Traversière.</p>

  <p>She lived only to discover more about her lover; her intense and furious
  interest was easily satisfied: the <i>porte claquette</i> announced the
  forthcoming betrothal, and for a day or so Paris talked of nothing else.</p>

  <p>Julie learnt that Mademoiselle de Courcelles was a granddaughter of
  Dancourt, the dramatist; that she had pretensions to art and learning; that
  she did not disguise a frantic adoration for M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>Julie also learnt that even at the last he had deceived her the project
  was nothing new, nay, two years old, and his frequent absences from Paris had
  been caused by his visits to the Chateau de Courcelles.</p>

  <p>Still, it was the fact, not the person, that smote Julie; she did not for
  a moment believe that Jacques de Guibert was interested in Louise de
  Courcelles.</p>

  <p>Young girls had never, once her governess days were over, filled any place
  in Julie's life. Madame de Montsauge was as old as herself, Madame de
  Boufflers older; all her acquaintances were great ladies, disdainful of
  youth; the men who thronged the artificial atmosphere of the <i>salons</i>
  had never been heard to express any admiration of, or need for, youth.</p>

  <p>Women held sway by reason of wit, charm, intelligence, social prestige,
  enthusiasm, beauty of carriage, of clothes, of environment, of manner. A
  woman hardly existed till she was married&mdash;Julie had only heard girls
  mentioned as some pawn in the matrimonial game, some creature worth just so
  much in money or name or power.</p>

  <p>She believed Mademoiselle de Courcelles to be one of these. It was
  impossible that she who had held her own with Madame de Boufflers should
  really seriously consider as a rival a girl of eighteen.</p>

  <p>The shock, the insult, the despair, were none the less; but on this point
  she was calm: Mademoiselle de Courcelles had not won Jacques de Guibert and
  could never hold him. Julie was almost sorry for this poor puppet.</p>

  <p>Her own stormy relations with him were the same: she insisted on his
  presence to but fiercely repudiate him; she wrote to him but to upbraid; she
  swore she would love him no more, and in the same breath that she would die
  of his neglect.</p>

  <p>All her being revolted against the position he now offered her, yet her
  need of him was so great that she could not deny herself even the little he
  flung her. So terrible was her struggle, so acute her distress, that she
  longed for the day of his marriage as the condemned man might long for the
  day of his execution.</p>

  <p>The family De Courcelles came to Paris, and De Guibert was much in
  attendance on them. One day, after a miserable interview, he left Julie
  saying that Madame de Courcelles and her daughter were coming to his rooms
  that evening at seven.</p>

  <p>Julie, abandoned to her anguished loneliness, formed the resolve to be
  present also. She would see the doll who had bought Jacques de Guibert with
  twenty thousand livres of rent; she thought to wound him by letting him see
  her beside this little provincial.</p>

  <p>It was one of her good days: she had hardly any cough and neither headache
  nor any great weakness. She dressed with the greatest care: Madame
  Saint-Martin was nearly two hours arranging her in a robe and petticoat <i>à
  la polonaise</i> of broche and striped pale green and white gauze over an
  under-dress of white taffeta. The tight bodice was finished with a fichu of
  blonde lace, into which was fastened a bouquet of gold and silk roses. She
  wore a cap of lace and a huge black hat with a single green feather, her hair
  powdered in curls on her shoulders, and a large muff of Canadian marten.</p>

  <p>The dress was extravagant, in the extreme of a fashion that was almost
  grotesque, but Julie carried it as well as did the frivolous young Queen who
  had set it. Her face was skilfully painted and her eyes lustrous with
  excitement.</p>

  <p>When the lackey showed her into the presence of M. de Guibert she had the
  satisfaction of seeing him whiten with anger and mortification.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>!' he cried, 'do you not know who is coming?'</p>

  <p>'Mademoiselle de Courcelles,' said Julie. 'I have come to see her.'</p>

  <p>'To humiliate me?' he asked, his self-confidence, his serenity, for once
  entirely lost.</p>

  <p>Julie glanced at him maliciously.</p>

  <p>'Do you not know that I am a creature of impulse, and do not know what I
  may do?'</p>

  <p>She glanced round the little <i>salon</i>, so elegant in its ash-coloured
  and gold furniture, its white walls painted with wreaths of flowers, the
  straw-coloured silk curtains through which the spring sun was streaming, its
  bowls and vases of Sèvres china full of jasmine and roses, lilies and tulips.
  It made her own chamber seem shabby in the recollection.</p>

  <p>It was to maintain this luxury that he had run into the debts that he must
  marry to pay. All the petty details of this room had proved stronger than his
  love for Julie. So the cast-off mistress thought as she waited for the coming
  of the woman who was to supplant her. She remembered D'Alembert's poverty and
  the lack of means of M. de Mora, and how differently both these men had faced
  the same situation and how her relationship with all of them had been
  affected by this need of money.</p>

  <p>A look of great bitterness came over her vivid face; she went to the
  window and stood there looking out, but it was too high for her to see the
  street.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert struggled to command himself, but could by no means disguise
  his lively terror of some violence on Julie's part.</p>

  <p>'I entreat you not to meet these ladies now&mdash;they expected to find me
  alone,' he began desperately.</p>

  <p>'Do you not consider me fit to speak to your betrothed?' said Julie
  quietly. 'Ah, <i>mon ami</i>, if you bring her to live in Paris she will meet
  worse women.'</p>

  <p>'I believe you have come to humiliate me,' retorted</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert, 'to spy on me, to put me to the torture. Whatever your
  feelings towards me, remember that this young girl is innocent of all
  offence.'</p>

  <p>He could have said nothing more calculated to wound Julie's quivering
  pride.</p>

  <p>'Innocent,' she repeated. 'Ah, <i>mon Dieu</i>, this innocent young
  girl&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The words had hardly been spoken before the door opened on the two guests.
  The elder lady, a graceful creature in black and gray silks, began talking
  volubly to the overwhelmed young man; the younger, advancing into the room,
  found herself face to face with Julie de Lespinasse.</p>

  <p>If she felt any embarrassment at being thus confronted with a stranger, if
  she had any suspicion of who this might be, if she saw anything remarkable in
  the splendid personality, the haggard face and vivid eyes of this woman, she
  gave no sign, but serenely waited with a little smile.</p>

  <p>She was of a seductive loveliness&mdash;till that moment Julie had never
  realised what a power sheer youth and beauty might be.</p>

  <p>This creature was fresh as an opening rose, graceful and joyous in the
  bloom of life's earliest morning. She was of the type of the childish maidens
  beloved by Greuze, who was soon to paint her portrait. Her features were
  delicate, rosy, almost infantile; her limbs rounded and small; her eyes blue
  and languishing; her hair so fair as to be almost silver. She was dressed
  with a simplicity that was the height of cunning art; neither hoop nor powder
  disfigured her. Her mantle of fine white silk was open on a gown of white
  gauze over pink taffeta; she wore pearls round her throat and amid the
  careless drapery at her bosom. Her lovely waved hair was twisted with a braid
  of pearls and confined by a close circle of pink roses.</p>

  <p>Julie had never met any one like this. Madame de Foucalquier, Madame de
  Boufflers, Madame de la Vallière, might have been such as this in their
  youth, but Julie had not known them then.</p>

  <p>Madame de Courcelles, with some question in her manner, turned towards the
  stranger; the wretched M. de Guibert had to present them to each other.</p>

  <p>'Mademoiselle de Lespinasse came&mdash;-' he began lamely.</p>

  <p>Julie's hoarse, low, but calm voice took up the sentence.</p>

  <p>'I came to see Mademoiselle de Courcelles,' she said. 'As one of M. de
  Guibert's friends I was eager to behold his future wife.'</p>

  <p>The slight sense of tension in the air relaxed. Madame de Courcelles was
  charming to this famous lady. She had heard of her extraordinary friendship
  for M. de Guibert and was perfectly prepared to ignore the sentimental side
  of it, if need be. She had already, with tranquil serenity, met Madame de
  Montsauge, whose relations with her future son-in-law were as notorious as
  Julie's were obscure.</p>

  <p>'Mademoiselle accompanies us to the opera?' she asked, after several
  graceful compliments.</p>

  <p>'Nay,' replied Julie. 'I do not even stay to dinner. I do not go out now
  very much. Madame, my health is too poor...I was very desirous of seeing
  your...delightful daughter.'</p>

  <p>Louise de Courcelles curtseyed. She had a very pretty air of modesty and
  eager desire to please.</p>

  <p>'If Mademoiselle de Lespinasse will be my friend,' she said, 'I shall find
  Paris even more delightful than I do now.'</p>

  <p>'Too neatly turned!' thought Julie: 'She is well schooled.'</p>

  <p>She glanced at M. de Guibert, who flashed her a look of gratitude and
  admiration, and aloud she said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'This is the most fortunate of men whom you crown, Mademoiselle. He has
  never lacked anything, save such a Comtesse as yourself...To what may he not
  now attain? And you&mdash;may you be as happy as you deserve.'</p>

  <p>She took the girl's hand and smiled. There was both grandeur and sweetness
  in her look which vaguely touched Mademoiselle de Courcelles with an
  instinctive pity. She had heard the story of M. de Mora, and felt sorry for
  this woman, who seemed to her old and painted and ill and long since passed
  by love.</p>

  <p>Out of her own radiant happiness she glowed friendliness and joy.</p>

  <p>'I am such an insignificant person, Mademoiselle de Lespinasse, that I do
  not know how to reply to you nor how to thank you...I want to beg another
  favour&mdash;your further acquaintance.'</p>

  <p>Julie de Lespinasse gazed at the loveliness so near her that seemed of
  itself to give out a perfume exquisite to the senses. This was her rival;
  this the creature for whom she was cast off; there the lips he would kiss;
  all this beauty would lie in his embrace, adoring and adored. While
  she...</p>

  <p>'Adieu, Madame,' she said to the mother. 'M. de Guibert's choice is worthy
  of himself, of his gifts, and of his destiny&mdash;if you knew how much I
  admire him you would value this compliment from one who could not be your
  rival in anything, Mademoiselle, but who may be your admirer in
  everything.'</p>

  <p>She curtseyed to the elder lady. The girl, who had flushed very prettily,
  seemed to want to reply, but hesitated a little as to how to answer this
  polished language of the <i>salons</i>. Julie de Lespinasse gave her no
  chance, but left the room, accompanied by M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>'Go back to your guests,' she said, but he came with her to the door of
  the ante-chamber.</p>

  <p>'They are delighted,' he whispered in eager pleasure, 'charmed with
  you...and I&mdash;I could fall at your feet for the effort you have
  made...</p>

  <p>Julie turned and looked full at him. His flushed and winning face was near
  to hers; his simple masculinity showed through all his powder and curled
  locks and slightly over-rich dress of lavender-blue velvet and silver.</p>

  <p>'I cannot thank you&mdash;' he began.</p>

  <p>Julie put her hand over his mouth with a gesture that might have been
  either a light blow or a fierce caress. The hair ring of M. de Mora touched
  his lip.</p>

  <p>'Sh!' she breathed, 'go back to...your guests.'</p>

  <p>With no backward look she left him, descended to her modest carriage, went
  back to her modest lodgings. There, with that heroic candour of emotion that
  belonged to her least action; she at once wrote an impulsive letter to her
  lover.</p>

  <p>'I find this young creature charming, and indeed worthy of the interest
  that she has inspired in you. The manners, the figure, and the air of the
  mother are equally amiable and interesting. Yes, you will be happy.'</p>

  <p>She despatched this note so that it would reach M. de Guibert before he
  left for the opera, took off her stiff and stately dress, and in a quilted
  white silk jacket and white dimity skirt seated herself once more by the fire
  that she still kept, despite the May weather, in her bed-chamber.</p>

  <p>She was conscious of no pain now, only a great weariness that encompassed
  her like the waves of an encroaching sea. She only moved when her suppressed
  cough shook her, and then her face contracted with the start of agony in her
  chest.</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert was still out; he had expected her to dine with M. de
  Crillon.</p>

  <p>She thought of the little philosopher with a vague affection: 'If only I
  could have loved him, how happy I might have been...</p>

  <p>Madame Saint-Martin entered.</p>

  <p>'Has Mademoiselle seen the letters?'</p>

  <p>'No&mdash;what letters?'</p>

  <p>'Two letters came for Mademoiselle.'</p>

  <p>The chamberwoman went to fetch them, put them on the table nearest Julie,
  who was too weary to take them or even look at them&mdash;they would be from
  Condorcet or Suard or Abel de Vichy...of what interest to her now were any of
  these people?</p>

  <p>Madame Saint-Martin lingered and looked at her curiously.</p>

  <p>'One is from Spain, Mademoiselle.'</p>

  <p>'Give it me.'</p>

  <p>She saw the seal, the arms of the Fuentès; she saw the writing...</p>

  <p>'Leave me,' she stammered.</p>

  <p>The chamberwoman crept away.</p>

  <p>Julie sat up and turned the letters over. One was from Madrid, one from
  Bordeaux, both in the writing of the Marquis de Mora. She opened them; the
  dates were of a year ago.</p>

  <p>'From Madrid, which I am leaving to come to you,' one was headed; the
  other a scrawl, 'from near Bordeaux and almost a dying man.'</p>

  <p>Some error in the post had delayed these letters that now came like a
  summons from the dead&mdash;such, at least, they appeared to the exalted
  fancy of Julie de Lespinasse, who sat shivering and staring at them as if
  they had been dropped into her lap by the cold fingers of a phantom.</p>

  <p>Then as she read these broken words of a faithful, desperate love, her
  frozen pulses began to stir again to a rhythm of exquisite pain.</p>

  <p>The young man of her opium vision again appeared to her horror-struck
  fancy, and seemed to be beckoning to her from the vaults of Notre-Dame de Puy
  Paulin, a gulf opened at her feet in which unnameable horrors lurked. The
  fatal disease in her blood, the fumes 'of the drug in her brain, the anguish
  in her heart, combined to render her exalted to the point of delirium. These
  letters seemed to her like a warrant for her instant death. Beyond the circle
  of encroaching horrors she saw the utter blackness of complete annihilation,
  and all her ardent nature that had so loved life shuddered and
  recoiled...</p>

  <p>She sprang up as if she had been suddenly touched on the shoulders by a
  pursuer. Where was he while she was thus in torment&mdash;with the music, the
  light, the gaiety, with that fair, fragrant creature who claimed his lawful
  love...</p>

  <p>Julia staggered to her desk and wrote a bitter and burning letter to
  Jacques de Guibert. When she had sealed it, she had scarcely strength to ring
  the bell before she fainted.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch30"
     id="ch30"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

  <p class="first">Next morning found M. de Guibert, distracted and alarmed, at
  the door of the apartment in the rue Saint-Dominique.</p>

  <p>He could not see her, but on his return later in the day he was
  admitted.</p>

  <p>Julie was on the red ottoman. She had passed a terrible night and been all
  the morning in a hot bath. Her sufferings were now a little relieved, but she
  was utterly weak.</p>

  <p>She had made some effort to array herself, and wore a charming gown of
  pale blue and white striped muslin with sleeves of ruffled ancient lace and a
  fichu of white gauze, but her hair was undressed and gathered simply under a
  muslin cap.</p>

  <p>By her side was the acacia table set with a Sèvres tea-service in blue and
  white, and a little milk-pot in white, painted with flowers; a basket of
  Chantilly porcelain filled with fruit and two plates of sweets.</p>

  <p>She appeared calm and greeted M. de Guibert with a slow smile.</p>

  <p>'What a strange, inconceivable creature you are!' he broke out. 'I told
  you that I could have kissed your feet yesterday for your goodness&mdash;the
  language of heaven was on your lips&mdash;you caressed, you flattered
  Mademoiselle de Courcelles&mdash;she was enchanted and I overjoyed&mdash;and
  then that letter It has poisoned all your kindness...I do not understand.
  What do you want? What do you expect?' He paused, looking at her in deep
  vexation and genuine distress.</p>

  <p>Julie was silent. She gazed at him with avid, half-narrowed eyes.</p>

  <p>'What do you mean to do?' asked M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>'Do not ask me,' replied Julie, without moving. 'I know nothing, nay,
  nothing at all. If I listened to vanity and pride I could calculate my
  behaviour...as it is...Passion has no future. In saying to you "I love you" I
  say all that I know and all that I feel.'</p>

  <p>'But your resignation, your promises&mdash;' he began, in despair.</p>

  <p>'Ha! my resignation interrupted Julie. 'I, who have so well lived and so
  paid the price...so would I again, yes, I would accept life on the same
  conditions were it offered me...little interests have never meant anything to
  me&mdash;to love, to suffer, Heaven, Hell&mdash;when one has existed thus can
  one live on earth with all the slaves and automatons with whom one is
  surrounded?'</p>

  <p>'You are beside yourself,' said M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>'Yes, perhaps these are the thoughts of a mind exalted,' replied Julie.
  'But who are capable of noble and great actions? The reasonable, prudent, and
  little people?'</p>

  <p>'You certainly are neither reasonable nor prudent,' remarked M. de
  Guibert.</p>

  <p>'Go!' she cried, 'and do not stay here to turn and re-turn the poniard in
  my wound.' Her hoarse voice was suddenly violent and she sat forward on the
  couch trembling all over.</p>

  <p>'You made me live&mdash;you animated me with this passion&mdash;Why? That
  you might satisfy your vanity, your cruelty! You play with my despair, my
  torment, this fatal sentiment that is dearer to me than life&mdash;'</p>

  <p>A fierce cough broke her speech. She pressed her handkerchief to her mouth
  and the tears started to her eyes.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon amie</i>, calm yourself, calm yourself, I implore you,' entreated
  M. de Guibert; whose anger vanished at the sight of her obvious and piteous
  sufferings. 'You wrong me bitterly, but I love and I forgive. I came to you
  to-day to implore you, to beseech you to cease this humour that turns
  everything to gall. I have loved you, I do love you&mdash;I found you
  unhappy, I endeavoured to console you&mdash;this is my crime. Re-read my
  letters and see if I am guilty&mdash;think of the circumstances in which we
  are placed, and judge me then.'</p>

  <p>While he was speaking, with a charming air of frankness and that touching
  tenderness so well expressed by his beautiful voice, he approached Julie and
  leant over the ottoman so that he was gazing down on her as she lay passive,
  with her face hidden in the cushions.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon amie</i>,' he said gently, 'your love is as cruel as hate.'</p>

  <p>He felt sincerely sorry for her in this moment, and although his pity did
  not cloud the radiancy of his own happy fate, he would, in his careless,
  generous fashion, have done a good deal to heal this unhappy being whose
  malady he did not even understand.</p>

  <p>'Your letter,' he continued, 'cost me my sleep&mdash;I passed a night of
  horror.'</p>

  <p>'How many such nights have I not passed?' muttered Julie.</p>

  <p>'May heaven give us both sweeter slumbers henceforth,' said M. de Guibert,
  in a caressing tone. 'You look fatigued, <i>mon ami</i>, you are feverish.
  Forgive me, and sleep&mdash;sleep well and I will come again this
  evening&mdash;you are always my first thought.'</p>

  <p>Julie shuddered and looked up.</p>

  <p>'So with poison you bring me back to life,' she whispered. 'Why do you
  make sweet to me the life you take from me? What have you done to me? I have
  enough to endure now in the sheer fact of existence...Leave me, if you have
  any pity...I know not what frightful pleasure you take to thus trouble
  me.'</p>

  <p>'I love you, and cannot leave you in distress, Julie!'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' she answered faintly, 'even when you speak the truth you have the
  manner of a deceiver, and I believe not in this affection of yours.'</p>

  <p>She sat up, assuming the languid attitude of one in extreme ill-health,
  the unconscious droop of sickness.</p>

  <p>'Ha! <i>mon Dieu</i>!' she continued, 'how tired my soul is&mdash;how I
  long for some deliverance! Cure me of loving you&mdash;but that is
  impossible. I have no refuge against you but death!'</p>

  <p>'I know not what to say,' stammered M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>'You mean that I weary you. Go to Madame de Montsauge&mdash;she will be
  all that is wise and tender and reasonable&mdash;she will commend your choice
  and flatter your taste&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Julie!'</p>

  <p>She wiped her lips and smiled.</p>

  <p>'I will not tell you not to come and see me again,' she said, 'for I know
  that it is your intention. I go to M. Bertin this evening and then to
  <i>Orfèo</i>; in the interval to see Madame de Chatillon&mdash;like myself,
  she is always sick.'</p>

  <p>He stooped and kissed one of her pallid hands. 'You are in truth the most
  generous of creatures,' he said. 'Why must you belie yourself?'</p>

  <p>'You think to console me by flattering me?' she replied. '<i>Mon Dieu</i>
  I your praises only hurt me and there is nothing in the world can console
  me&mdash;Ah, leave me! I know not how long I can be calm&mdash;I am so
  troubled, so agitated, I wonder which will resist this torture the
  longest&mdash;my reason or my life.'</p>

  <p>He raised her hand and laid it with a caressing movement against his
  cheek.</p>

  <p>'Leave me,' she said wildly,' there is nothing for me in the whole
  universe but to love you and to die...See, you behold the bottom of my
  soul&mdash;you know what fills it with life and with despair...Leave me!'</p>

  <p>'While you are in this state I cannot&mdash;I will not,' he replied. 'Do
  you think that I am not concerned in your happiness?'</p>

  <p>Her mood suddenly changed. She snatched her hand away from him.</p>

  <p>'Julie,' he said, 'be not so unreasonable&mdash;believe that I shall
  always be your friend.</p>

  <p>'Is it in this manner that you take your happiness?' demanded Julie
  bitterly. 'I dare not complain of it, if it is your good fortune that makes
  you behave like this, but I would have you know that it is not in my power to
  suffer protection and compassion&mdash;'</p>

  <p>She rose and moved away from him, her feeble figure drawn to its full
  height.</p>

  <p>'I am not so base,' she added. 'Spare me the expression of your pity,
  which but puts the crown upon my unhappiness&mdash;persuade yourself that you
  owe me nothing, and that I do not exist for you&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Julie!'</p>

  <p>'It is no great effort that I ask of you,' she added. 'You have only to
  preserve the habit you have already formed of not considering me in the least
  in your life, and to refrain from these forced expressions of commiseration
  that wound me to death.'</p>

  <p>She said these words in a hoarse, hurrying voice, the tones full of a
  despair of emotion, a warm and yet bitter strength, so sincere, so heroic in
  its candour and noble agony that M. de Guibert was silent, some instinct
  telling him that he could neither judge her pain nor his own
  unworthiness.</p>

  <p>'I frighten you&mdash;I make you hate me,' she said, in a broken voice,
  looking at him keenly. 'Have you thought how I must suffer to so speak to
  you? My regrets...my remorse...my dread of the future...but you have nothing
  to do with that.'</p>

  <p>She paused, coughed, and wiped her lips. Shaken by her words into trouble
  and an uneasy emotion of pity and regret, but in no way moved from his
  resolutions nor able nor willing to make any sacrifice to spare her pain,
  Jacques de Guibert stood frowning at the floor, as much at a loss as he had
  ever been in his triumphant life.</p>

  <p>'When is this marriage to be?' she asked, in a low voice.</p>

  <p>He did not look at her as he replied.</p>

  <p>'The contract was signed the first of this month.'</p>

  <p>She turned on him with an extraordinary expression of pain, as if she
  heard this dreadful thing for the first time.</p>

  <p>'It is signed, then, this contract? God grant that it has pronounced as
  surely on your happiness as it has on my life!'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert looked at her. She was suddenly gentle.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon ami</i>,' she said, 'I can no longer endure my thoughts...you
  overwhelm me. Leave me to recover the strength that you have robbed me
  of...'</p>

  <p>She sank into a low chair by the fire, shivering all over, and began to
  laugh a little, catching her breath and coughing.</p>

  <p>His facile good nature was instantly moved by her gentleness. He
  approached her with a timid look of affection and penitence.</p>

  <p>'<i>Adieu</i>,' said Julie, turning her head away and speaking faintly.
  She quivered, clenched her hands, moved her head slowly, and gazed at him,
  saw him distressed, agitated, and melted into a yearning tenderness. Her love
  became almost maternal in its selflessness. '<i>Adieu</i>,' she said
  impulsively. 'May you always be so happy and so occupied as to forget even
  the remembrance of my unhappiness and my love...do nothing more for
  me...<i>Adieu</i>.'</p>

  <p>He would have put his arm round her, but she shrank into a corner of the
  chair with such horror that he withdrew.</p>

  <p>'Leave me,' she murmured. 'Call my woman&mdash;I am ill.'</p>

  <p>She seemed, indeed, on the point of fainting, and he could do nothing but
  ring the bell.</p>

  <p>Madame Saint-Martin entered instantly from the bedchamber. Julie made an
  effort to raise her head.</p>

  <p>'<i>Adieu, mon ami</i>,' she said to M. de Guibert. 'Your visit has helped
  me to pass this long day.'</p>

  <p>'I chill send to-night for your news,' he answered. 'I am Leading your
  <i>Catinat</i>,' she murmured wistfully.</p>

  <p>He took his leave, thoughtful this time, and a little heavy-hearted.</p>

  <p>Julie lay heavily in the low chair.</p>

  <p>'May,' she kept saying to herself, 'always this month of May&mdash;in May
  I met him&mdash;in May he left me&mdash;in May M. de Mora died&mdash;in May
  his marriage&mdash;in May my death, too&mdash;this year or next?'</p>

  <p>She would not return to her bed; she had not the strength, she said. She
  remained inert, staring into the fire, until M. D'Alembert returned.</p>

  <p>He was full of the discourse of M. de Duras at the Academy and of his own
  <i>L'Eloge de Bossuet</i> that he was about to read.</p>

  <p>Julie answered with some semblance of interest, but her thoughts wandered
  far.</p>

  <p>To be married in May...Her mind turned to old, delicious fairy tales that
  had once touched her with the magic of the soul's most sacred, most secret
  longings...A chateau amid rose gardens, set in the spring woods; peace and
  sunshine and an enchanted remoteness from the world; a woman young and
  lovely, loving and beloved, in silk and pearl, the bride of a man whom she
  adored...Ah, the radiant days! How he would make her happy, that creature
  herself like a rose...Eighteen...wife of Jacques de Guibert...<i>wife</i>,
  honoured, noble...his wife...and presently there would be his children...</p>

  <p>Julie sat up. The violence of her emotions, so unsuited to the delicacy of
  her features, had distorted her face so that it was hideous; but not to
  D'Alembert.</p>

  <p>'You suffer,' he said, breaking off his discourse.</p>

  <p>Julie nodded. It was as if she had been tortured into dumbness and tried
  to cry aloud with her eyes. Her friend and her woman helped her to her
  chamber and put her to bed. They crept away when they thought that she
  slept.</p>

  <p>Julie, as soon as she was alone, crawled from her bed to her desk and
  wrote to M. de Mora.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch31"
     id="ch31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

  <p class="first">The wedding of M. de Guibert was fixed for the first of
  June, in the Chateau de Courcelles, and Julie de Lespinasse, in these few
  days left to her, was driven by a thousand contradictions of her agitated
  heart into as many different moods. There was only one more humiliation
  possible and this befell her. She discovered that in representing his
  marriage as one of convenience, M. de Guibert had deceived her. A desperate
  visit to his house to endeavour to recover some of her letters, a glance at
  his carelessly-kept desk, the sight of a letter of his to Madame de
  Courcelles, and one of Mademoiselle de Courcelles to him, revealed the truth.
  He had been on intimate terms with the family for the last two years. His
  bride-to-be was in love with him and he with her...Julie discovered that she
  had never occupied the first place in his inconstant heart.</p>

  <p>Exasperated to the point of madness, her delicate, ardent, and sensitive
  nature in constant and bitter torture, she again turned on her lover with a
  fury that left him overwhelmed.</p>

  <p>'What vile action is this that you have committed for 20,000 livres rent!
  You used me to break off with Madame de Montsauge, and pave the way for your
  marriage.' She continually demanded his presence, only to reject and repulse
  him when he came. She was in a continual fever, and her dreadful nights were
  passed in delirium; her dreadful days between outbursts of emotion and long
  swoons of exhaustion. All her friends (save D'Alembert, always completely in
  the dark) believed her still mourning for M. de Mora, and this pity and
  consideration that she usurped, was yet another pang of agony. 'If they knew
  that it is not the death of M. de Mora but your marriage that is killing me,
  what would they think of me?' she cried fiercely to M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>He could only present a patient front, a rather indifferent kindness to
  these scenes and tempests of passion. He could neither understand her love,
  her despair, her remorse, nor her shame. The violence of her feelings
  bewildered him. His normal, healthy temperament, selfish and slightly obtuse,
  was incapable of dealing with such a nature as that of Julie de Lespinasse.
  He could only offer banal consolations when his good nature was touched, and
  banal reproaches when his anger was roused.</p>

  <p>A visit from Prince Pignatelli, the brother of M. de Mora, who had lately
  come to Paris, threw Julie into fresh convulsions of terror. The face, voice,
  and gestures of this young man all reminded her of her dead lover, and she
  regarded this visit as she had regarded the two delayed letters, as a sign
  from the grave that her fate was upon her, At length this period of torture
  came to an end. A year after, almost to the very day that M. de Mora had
  died, M. de Guibert left her to go to the Chateau in Berri, and join the
  family of his betrothed.</p>

  <p>Julie wrote to him on the eve of his departure, '<i>Adieu</i>, and do not
  seek to see me. My soul is in despair, and you can never calm it...if you are
  honourable, leave without endeavouring to see me.'</p>

  <p>He came, however, and Julie, half fainting, murmuring incoherent words of
  love and hate, was in his arms. He pressed into her hand a little ring of
  gold thread twisted round a lock of his hair, begged her to wear it and
  remember the faithful attachment he would always bear to her, kissed her damp
  cheek with his fresh lips, and ended this cruel farewell by abruptly leaving
  her. Julie, on her knees, put his little ring on her finger; the gold wire
  broke, and the hair uncurled into her palm. Julie shuddered with
  superstitious terror, thrust the broken jewel into the bosom of her black
  gown, tried to stagger into her chamber, and fainted on the threshold.</p>

  <p>For eight days she did not leave her bed. She was without words, without
  tears. When she had the strength, her rose-coloured portfolio was brought to
  her, and she wrote to M. de Mora, telling him her misery and entreating him
  to cease his vengeance.</p>

  <p>From the happy and fortunate bridegroom, no news. Julie from her darkened
  sick chamber saw, as in a vision, the delicate beauty and her lover wandering
  in the summer glades. When she shuddered from her medicine, or turned from
  her food with disgust, she thought of them pledging each other in beautiful
  wine and smiling at each other across a table covered with fine viands.</p>

  <p>D'Alembert hardly left her room; once, when she felt his tears on the hand
  of hers he held, she smiled at him. It was the sole reward that he had for
  these days of patient self-abnegation.</p>

  <p>At length, one morning came Madame Saint-Martin with a letter&mdash;from
  the Chateau de Courcelles&mdash;from M. le Comte de Guibert. It was not meant
  as a cruel letter; composed in the first flush of a new and exquisite
  happiness, it had been sent with the selfish desire of breaking all links
  with the past. As he no longer saw Julie he believed that she was no longer
  suffering, and he wrote to tell her that she must not entertain any more
  hopes. With his usual awkwardness he excused his desertion, and begged her to
  forget one not worthy of her regrets. To the wan woman who read these words,
  seated in the bed, disordered by the tossing of a long night of delirium,
  they appeared as the last insult.</p>

  <p>For six weeks her frail body struggled with the agony of her soul; then
  she wrote to the man who had not even, during this period, inquired if she
  was alive or dead.</p>

  <p>'I see you now as you are. I see that you have committed a vile action; I
  see that you did not hesitate to reduce me to despair with the sole object of
  filling in the time between your rupture with Madame de Montsauge and your
  marriage, and, as long as you achieved your end, it mattered nothing to you
  that you robbed me of the sole good that remained to me, my
  self-respect.'</p>

  <p>A little strength returned to her, she flung herself into her old life
  with feverish energy. She re-opened her <i>salon</i>, surrounded herself with
  her brilliant friends, went to the opera, the theatre, to suppers,
  receptions, stiffing her illness with enormous doses of opium, and getting
  through the days by reason of her extraordinary, and now hysteric and half
  delirious vitality. There was no sign from the hero of the idyll at
  Courcelles, until one day the proof of his <i>Eloge de Catinat</i> was put
  into her hands with a note from him asking her advice and corrections. Julie
  answered in impulsive anger. 'Permit me the feeling of pride and of vengeance
  that gives me pleasure to say that I pardon you, and that it is no longer in
  your power to make me know fear...your marriage, in letting me see your
  entire soul, has closed mine for ever. There was a time when I would rather
  have seen you unhappy than contemptible&mdash;that time is no more.'</p>

  <p>Yet, despite this cruel invective, her love was too true and deep to be
  able to resist the frank egotism, so like that of a child, with which he had
  sent her his work, trusting in her help. She read it again; she saw some
  faults. She thought of his rival perhaps at the coming <i>concours</i>. A new
  interest began to flicker in her soul, she could not forbear working at his
  proofs with as much zeal as if he was still faithful to her. His mother could
  not have yearned over his work with a purer affection, war longed for his
  success with greater disinterestedness.</p>

  <p>A terrible attack of her illness, a convulsion of agony, a succession of
  fits and swooning, suddenly came upon her in the height of the summer. She
  said afterwards that only the sight of D'Alembert's bitter distress caused
  her to make an effort to return to her dreadful life, and she still lay half
  unconscious, her breath almost extinct, when two letters were brought her
  from Jacques de Guibert. The gentleness of these, the words '<i>mon
  amie</i>,' caused her heart to beat again. As before, her bitter revolt ended
  in her snatching greedily at any scrap of affection he would accord her. Once
  more he bade her live and she obeyed him. Once more resignation succeeded the
  tempest. She dreamed of renouncing her wild passion, and filling her life
  with a gentle and pure friendship, and in a tone of touching humility she
  confided her resolution to the man whom she adored.</p>

  <p>'I will never trouble your repose and your duty, which to me are
  sacred.'</p>

  <p>The failure of the famous <i>Le Connétable de Bourbon</i>, both before the
  court and the public, wounded her tenderness as much as it did the author's
  vanity, though her shrewd judgment had foretold it.</p>

  <p>When he returned to Paris in October, they were no longer lovers. M. de
  Guibert, his conscience at ease, and his heart satisfied, remained her tender
  and affectionate friend. Julie kept her word. Her courage was as great as her
  love, and if there were moments in which he would have evoked the past, she
  repulsed him with a firmness that left him confused and vanquished.</p>

  <p>These struggles, however she might subdue them, left her more and more
  desperate. 'I do not any longer know how to write to you. I fear to see you,'
  she wrote to him. 'My soul is in torture. I confound everything. I know not
  if it is sin or virtue that makes unhappiness...I know not which is worse,
  remorse or regrets...the sense that you care for me is the sole thing that
  holds me to life...yesterday evening you convinced me of this&mdash;at the
  end of a quarter of an hour of your company, I feel that I am alone with you
  in the universe; you annihilate the past and the present. You are no longer
  guilty, and I am no longer unhappy!'</p>

  <p>She did not deceive herself as to her own strength. She had acted on her
  instincts of duty and honour in this rupture with her love. She had the
  courage to maintain her resolution, but she knew that she must die of it, and
  she longed for death ardently with all the force of her passionate and
  imperious nature.</p>

  <p>She ceased to have even a shadow of interest for the events taking place
  beyond her doors; the only thing that roused her during this time was the
  failure of M. de Guibert's <i>Catinat</i>, and the victory of his rival and
  her ancient friend, La Harpe.</p>

  <p>Madame Geoffrin, Madame de Boufflers, Madame de Chatillon in vain besought
  her to follow the advice of her doctor and give up the excessive use of
  drugs, but she was deaf to their reasoning and their entreaties, to the
  affection of D'Alembert, and the distress of Condorcet and Suard; her firm
  refusal of all advice, her persistent dwelling on the idea of death, amounted
  to suicide.</p>

  <p>Her doctor continually told her that her cure lay in her own hands and
  that it was from the soul had first come this incurable malady that attacked
  her body. 'We have no remedy for the spirit,' he told her, and in despair
  left her. Julie wrote her will, disposed of her humble means, provided for a
  poor family in whom she was interested; for her servants, for the porter of
  the house; left her books and her furniture to her different friends, and
  begged the Marquis de Vichy to see to her debts if there were any. She
  directed how she should be buried and implored that her papers should be all
  burnt.</p>

  <p>The letters of her lovers and her own replies she meant to destroy, but
  with the feebleness of sickness this task was postponed from day to day. She
  was now generally too ill to leave her room, often too ill to leave her bed;
  her days passed in opium-sleeps or attacks of haunted pain.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert, at first angry at what he called 'this detestable
  capricious resolve to die,' and then alarmed at the rapid change in her
  health, became tender and attentive when he was in Paris and a constant
  correspondent when he was away.</p>

  <p>Julie was not deceived; she knew that this facile affection was only
  roused by pity, and she suspected him of being in love with his wife, but she
  could not resist the joy his presence, his solicitude, gave her. 'I am no
  longer myself when you are with me, you charm all my sufferings...I hardly
  know if or no I am in pain. When I see you I know nothing save that I love
  you. Heaven is in my soul, and I cannot judge yours...I forget that you are
  guilty...I love you.'</p>

  <p>The commiseration of her friends who believed her dying for M. de Mora,
  continued to weigh on her: 'How they would despise me if they knew!' she
  wrote in bitter humiliation to M. de Guibert. 'What a horror they would
  conceive of me! But it could be no more than that I have of myself. I know
  not how it is that twenty times already the words that would discover the
  secret of my life and my heart, have not escaped my lips.'</p>

  <p>But her shame was stronger than her honesty, and she continued to disguise
  even from her most intimate friends what was killing her. In this desperate
  anxiety to preserve her secret she was unkind to the unhappy D'Alembert. His
  attentions met with distracted silences, dry answers, and the little
  philosopher went about with the air of a man in despair.</p>

  <p>'I am not worthy of his friendship and his virtues,' said Julie to De
  Guibert one evening. 'He irritates me. I wish that he would leave me.'</p>

  <p>She lay in her bed, sunk in cushions, the red curtains drawn back, and M.
  de Guibert, who had been allowed in for a few moments, was seated by the
  night-table with its horrid array of bottles and glasses, handkerchiefs,
  basins, and fruit.</p>

  <p>The room was dose, and a sickly smell of medicine and perfume mingled in
  the air. Julie was slightly propped up in bed. She wore a jacket and cap of
  frilled muslin; none of her hair showed, her face was damp and clay-coloured,
  her emaciation terrible, but her eyes dwelt with a look of dominant love on
  the face of the man beside her, which was illuminated by the solitary candle
  in the brass stick on the night-table.</p>

  <p>'I think you might have some pity for M. D'Alembert, <i>mon amie</i>,'
  said M. de Guibert. 'He is in the state of the greatest distress&mdash;he
  knows not what his crime is and dares not demand it&mdash;he sees that you
  are changed and knows not why.'</p>

  <p>Julie moved her head impatiently, 'I am cold, so cold,' she murmured. 'I
  shiver, I die of this concentrated cold, which is twenty degrees below that
  of Réaumur, it is as if I were plunged into ice. Ah, the long nights, with
  the pain and the visions and the headache.'...</p>

  <p>'The opium, does not that quiet you, <i>mon ami</i>?'...</p>

  <p>'As the Medusa's head was quieted,' she answered. 'I am petrified without
  the use of any of my faculties&mdash;what I behold is for me a magic
  lantern&mdash;I cannot put the names to objects, I am dead in life.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>!' exclaimed M. de Guibert, 'you risk poisoning yourself a
  hundred times...if you have ever loved me forbear these heavy doses.'</p>

  <p>Julie shuddered. 'My heart is so cold,' she complained.</p>

  <p>'<i>Grand Dieux</i> cried M. de Guibert in agitation, 'you frighten
  me...so also Phèdre expressed herself.'</p>

  <p>Julie stared at him without answering. He wore blue velvet, he looked
  young, fresh, and healthy in this sick chamber; his figure had become
  slightly heavier, the thickness of his jaw and neck was more noticeable; his
  blunt, charming features, though now wearing an expression of distress, were
  forming in lines given by a satisfied manhood and a happy destiny.</p>

  <p>'Leave me to my remorse,' muttered Julie. 'I am guilty! I am punished! M.
  de Mora is avenged. What do you want more? Leave me, I will not inflict on
  you this too long agony of the creature whom you have struck to death.'</p>

  <p>'Julie!' he answered reproachfully, 'this remorse will drive you to death
  and me to madness...' He rose. 'You will come again?' whispered the sick
  woman. 'To-morrow in passing.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, in truth,' interrupted Julie, 'all that you grant me&mdash;all that
  you have ever accorded me has been in passing.'</p>

  <p>She closed her eyes and lay quite silent. M. de Guibert stood looking down
  at her with a bewildered expression. 'Why will you torture yourself thus?' he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>She opened her eyes. 'A quick death would have pleased me better,' she
  said feebly, 'but the torment to which you have put me has taken from me the
  force, the courage to achieve it. I am so ruined that I could live even to
  receive one kind word from you. <i>Hélas</i>, if I could rest!' Her eyelids
  drooped and it seemed as if her mind wandered a little.</p>

  <p>'Six years of happiness! Was not that something to thank God for? Was he
  not a perfect lover? And she whom he loved is so degraded&mdash;so degraded.
  Help me to bear this blow you have struck me. I can die, but I cannot leave
  you.'</p>

  <p>With a sudden movement of surprising energy, she sat up. M. de Guibert
  stared with fascinated horror at her excessive thinness. He had not believed
  that one could be so emaciated and live.</p>

  <p>'How I have been loved!' she panted. 'Why was it not by you?'</p>

  <p>A cough choked her broken voice, a spasm of nausea convulsed her, she made
  a sign for M. de Guibert to leave her. He called Madame Saint-Martin, who
  waited in the dressing-room, and fled from this scene of physical
  humiliation&mdash;fled from the coughing, the sickness, the stained pillows
  and night linen, the distorted face, the skeleton-like body, the filmed eyes
  of the woman whom he had once loved and who looked at him now with a passion
  that seemed beyond either love or hate.</p>

  <p>He was glad of the spring air in the streets, of the nosegays of flowers
  in the baskets of the market-women going home with their unsold wares that
  showed softly in the light of the moon and the oil lamps. He was glad of the
  fresh breeze on his face that seemed to take from him the remembrance of that
  ruined body and that despairing soul, and all the stale odours of the haunted
  sick-room.</p>

     id="ch32"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

  <p class="first">In May, as she had foretold, Julie de Lespinasse died; it
  was just four years since she had met M. de Guibert, just two since the death
  of M. de Mora, and just one since the marriage of her lover. She died after a
  long agony, from the last stages of which she excluded the man whom she
  adored; her face was distorted with continual convulsions, and her pride
  would not permit him to have this last remembrance of her. M. de Vichy came
  to her death-bed and she received the sacraments 'in the face of and despite
  of all the Encyclopaedia,' as her brother said proudly. To the last she
  continued to write to Jacques de Guibert; the one regret in leaving life that
  she had, was that he would so soon forget her; his agitated tenderness, his
  constant attention, his genuine, grief did not deceive her as to the depth of
  his affection.</p>

  <p>'A wife, a mistress, your duty, your pleasure,' she wrote, 'You will not
  have time to grieve for me...</p>

  <p>He occupied her thoughts even through the incoherence of the last agony;
  the day she died she asked for her rose-coloured portfolio, and with a feeble
  hand and a mind beclouded, expressed the last sigh of her supreme
  passion.</p>

  <p>'<i>Mon ami</i>, I love you, this calms my pain&mdash;it rests with you to
  change this opiate into poison, a poison that would be of all others the most
  violent and sure. <i>Hélas!</i> find it so terrible to live, that I implore
  your pity and your generosity to grant me this <i>succour</i>, it will
  terminate a painful agony that one day will weigh on your soul. Ah, <i>mon
  ami</i>, let me owe you my repose. In pity be once cruel. I can no more,
  <i>Adieu</i>.'</p>

  <p>With these confused words she besought him to cease to hold her to life by
  his distress and his affection, and when they were sent she soon fell into
  the last swoon while in the act of murmuring to D'Alembert her affection, her
  gratitude, and her remorse. At two o'clock that night she opened her eyes,
  murmured, 'Do I still live?' and then closed them for ever, expiring in the
  arms of D'Alembert and in the presence of the Marquis de Vichy and her old
  friends.</p>

  <p>She was buried as she had directed, very simply, in the church of
  Saint-Sulpice, Condorcet and D'Alembert her chief mourners, and Jacques de
  Guibert unnoticed among the crowd.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch33"
     id="ch33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

  <p class="first">A few days after the funeral, M. de Guibert entered the
  apartments of Mademoiselle de Lespinasse with that stupid feeling of
  credulity that follows bereavement. Though he had seen the stone swung into
  place above her coffin, the emptiness of her rooms seemed unnatural.</p>

  <p>Henri, her valet, had opened the door to him, Madame Saint-Martin was
  moving about. Flowers were still in the vases, candles in the sticks; the
  windows were open on the May sunshine that streamed in over the red ottoman
  where there still lay a white quilted <i>couvre pied</i> that Julie had
  used.</p>

  <p>He stood irresolute, slightly confused. He had come to see D'Alembert, and
  to obtain his letters or to ascertain if they were destroyed, but for the
  moment he forgot his errand.</p>

  <p>A young man was quietly going round the room with a note-book and
  pencil.</p>

  <p>'Who is this?' asked M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>'Monsieur,' said Madame Saint-Martin, who looked quite ill from weeping,
  'it is the lawyer's clerk who takes the inventory&mdash;the things have to be
  valued and the rooms sealed up.' She stooped mechanically and began packing
  up some dresses that stood in an open mantua-maker's box among silver paper.
  'She was so fond of clothes, Monsieur, she bought these two weeks
  ago&mdash;her taste was most exquisite!'</p>

  <p>She folded away a gown of English embroidery, one of silk tartan on a
  white ground, one of white and green brocade, and one of white and
  poppy-coloured satin in wide stripes, that the whim of the dying woman had
  ordered.</p>

  <p>The notary came out of the bed-chamber, bowed, and effaced himself in
  joining his clerk. The businesslike murmur of their voices rose steadily as
  they went over Julie's treasures.</p>

  <p>'Forty volumes, <i>The History of Clarisse</i>, twenty-nine volumes
  <i>Contes Moreaux</i>, forty-three volumes <i>Lettres de Madame de
  Sevigné</i>, all to be valued by a librarian.'</p>

  <p>They had finished the books and began to take the pictures and
  furniture.</p>

  <p>'A cylinder desk of satin wood, ornaments of ormolu, a little bird in
  marble on its pedestal of gilt brass, a bust of M. de Voltaire, of M.
  D'Alembert...</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert passed brusquely into the bedchamber. Julie's two other
  women-servants were there, and the Commissionaire of the Chatelet. The
  curtains were drawn back from the alcove, the bedding rolled up on the bed,
  some medicine bottles still remained on the night-table; in the middle of the
  floor stood several baskets covered with yellow linen, from which one woman
  was unpacking clothes that the other was describing on her list. M. de
  Guibert saw one, a dress of lilac silk trimmed with filet lace, the gown that
  she had worn that day in February at the opera.</p>

  <p>'A robe and petticoat of black <i>poult-de-soie</i>, a bath robe of
  English flannel, seventy chemises, fifty-three handkerchiefs, and different
  adjustments of ribbons, blondes, and gauzes not worth
  describing&mdash;altogether worth two hundred Byres.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert turned away, a faint perfume was rising from all this linen
  and packed-away clothes; little trifles of ribbon and knots of artificial
  silk flowers were scattered over the floor. Madame Saint-Martin and the
  Commissionaire were going over the little boxes of painted wood and cardboard
  on one of the side tables. There were her watch with the steel chain,
  'bearing the number 2146,' wrote the Commissionaire, her chatelaine, her
  steel shoe-buckles, her tablets of ivory and of red morocco, a little red
  wood necklace, a little silver compass, a ring with the portrait of Louis XV.
  that M. de Guibert had never seen her wear, and little tiny
  <i>bijoux</i>&mdash;such as a little silver wolf, two little flacons in gold
  and crystal, one in blue and gold, scissors and pencil-cases in ivory and
  silver&mdash;all scattered together with the boxes of olive wood lined with
  tortoiseshell, of red horn, and of gilt and painted cardboard and lacquer
  powder boxes and toilet cases. A set of the game <i>Trou Madame</i>, and in
  the midst the two miniatures of M. de Mora, the two little hearts he had
  given her, and the ring she had given him, which Madame de Villa Hermosa had
  sent from Madrid.</p>

  <p>'Where is M. D'Alembert?' asked M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>Madame Saint-Martin broke off her task. 'Monsieur, he went upstairs a
  little while ago; he has been going over the papers, the portfolios&mdash;a
  sad task. I think he could hardly endure it...</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert was silent, the low voices of the women came steadily from
  behind him,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Five pairs of muslin sleeves trimmed with different laces, a collar of
  <i>point D'Argentan</i>, another pair of sleeves with three frills of muslin
  trimmed with ancient point, five dressing-gowns of white linen...</p>

  <p>'Was all this necessary?' asked M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>'It is by Mademoiselle's orders, Monsieur, she wished everything valued,'
  replied Madame Saint-Martin, opening the toilet boxes and showing their
  contents to the Commissionaire.</p>

  <p>'A bed-jacket and petticoat of cotton trimmed with muslin, another Indian
  silk striped puce and white...M. de Guibert passed into the <i>salon</i>; an
  ugly nostalgia assailed him. The rooms full of the dead woman's clothes and
  personal belongings, the sense of emptiness and disorder, the drooping
  flowers in the vases, the stale perfume and faint odour of medicine in the
  air affected him very unpleasantly. The <i>pot-pourri</i> in the lacquer jar
  had been upset, and the withered rose and lavender trickled over the floor.
  He noticed that one of the Regency rosewood <i>commodes</i> had been moved
  slightly away from the door; he knew that this had been done to allow the
  coffin to pass.</p>

  <p>The parrot and the dog had gone&mdash;Madame Geoffrin had taken both. The
  empty ring and the empty basket were left.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert picked up a little work-bag of shot gold and pink taffeta
  which he had often seen Julie handle. Inside was a piece of cambric and a
  packet of comfits. He remembered when he had bought them for her; she had
  never opened them, but tied them up with a silver ribbon and put them
  away.</p>

  <p>The voices of the notary and his clerk rose: 'Two engravings under glass
  in frames of gilt wood, after Bauvarlet, two after Dietrich.'</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert entered from the ante-chamber, and M. de Guibert turned to
  him with an air of relief. The philosopher clasped his hand in silence, and
  put on the red ottoman three portfolios.</p>

  <p>'You have been going over the papers?' asked M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert gave him an extraordinary look and sat down beside the
  portfolios.</p>

  <p>'Monsieur, you have fatigued yourself,' said M. de Guibert kindly.</p>

  <p>The philosopher seized the young man's hand again as if he gained strength
  from the touch of the firm, warm fingers.</p>

  <p>'I am glad you have come,' he said in a rough voice. 'I am glad you have
  come.'</p>

  <p>'Two engravings under glass in gilt and black frames, the
  <i>Paralytique</i> and <i>L'Accordée de Village</i>, after M. Greuze, the
  <i>Chevalier Bayard</i> in mezzotint.'</p>

  <p>'Cannot these be sent away?' asked M. de Guibert. The other rose with a
  distracted air and begged the notary to leave the <i>salon</i> and go
  upstairs to the kitchen and servants' rooms, upon which he withdrew with his
  clerk, and M. D'Alembert dosed the door into the bedroom. M. de Guibert
  watched him; he was most horribly changed, and looked, in his plain mourning,
  an old man. His shoulders and his knees seemed bent, his face was sunken and
  rigid beneath his carelessly-powdered hair, his mouth and chin continually
  quivered, and his tired eyes were bloodshot and frayed.</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert, who was composed and fresh in his uniform as Colonel
  Commander of the Corsican Legion, looked at him with curiosity.</p>

  <p>'You have not seen the will, Monsieur le Comte?'</p>

  <p>'No, Monsieur.'</p>

  <p>D'Alembert took a paper out of his pocket and gave it to the soldier who
  glanced over it quickly. D'Alembert was the sole executor.</p>

  <p>All her clothes, linen, laces, to Madame Saint-Martin. A year's wages and
  the furniture of his room, to the valet, Henri. Her Racine and Molière, and
  the dictionary of Moreri, recently left her by M. d'Uzes, to M. d'Anlezy. To
  M. de Saint-Chamans all her manuscripts. To Madame Saint-Chamans her toilet
  set of rosewood&mdash;'and I hope that, as I used it every day, it will
  sometimes recall to her my tender sentiment.' To M. Suard, her satin-wood
  desk. To M. Condorcet, her busts of Voltaire and D'Alembert, and such
  engravings as he cared to take. To Madame Geoffrin&mdash;'whom I love so
  tenderly'&mdash;the little marble bird on the gilt pedestal. To M. Roux, her
  doctor, her watch and clock. To M. de Vaines, the portrait of the Archbishop
  of Toulouse. To M. de Guibert, her books in French and English. To M.
  D'Alembert, three pieces of furniture in rose-wood, and to her brother, the
  Marquis de Vichy, the payment of her debts, if there should be any. 'Not out
  of generosity,' she added proudly, 'but out of consideration for the sum
  taken from me at the death of his mother and mine.'</p>

  <p>In a note she begged D'Alembert to take the two little hearts from her
  watch, the hair-ring from her finger, the two portraits of M. de Mora, and
  send them to Madame de Villa Hermosa. She also implored him to burn all the
  papers she had marked 'To be burnt.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Eh Bien</i>,' said M. de Guibert, rather at a loss.</p>

  <p>'Read, if you please, Monsieur,' said the other in a quivering voice,
  'this letter.'</p>

  <p>It was addressed to D'Alembert. M. de Guibert read it with a curious
  feeling of wonder that the philosopher should have taken him so into his
  confidence.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">'I owe you all. I am so sure of your friendship, that I
  will use what is left to me of strength to support a life where I neither
  hope nor fear anything more. My unhappiness is beyond consolation, but I
  still feel that I owe it to you to make an effort to prolong the days I have
  in horror. However, as I cannot count upon my strength of will, nor that it
  will not cede to my despair, I take the precaution to write to you, to beg
  you to burn, without reading, all the letters in the large, black portfolio.
  I have not the force to touch them. I should die on seeing the writing of my
  friend. I have also in my pocket a rose-coloured portfolio, where there are
  letters that I beg you to burn. Do not read them, but keep his portrait for
  the love of me...I do not recall if I have disposed of the desk where you
  will find this, if not, I pray you to send it to M. de Guibert, begging him
  to receive it as a mark of my friendship.</p>

  <p class="letter">'Adieu, mon ami; do not regret me. Think that in leaving
  life I find a repose that I could no longer hope for here. Preserve the
  memory of M. de Mora as the most virtuous, the most sensible, the most
  unhappy man who ever existed. Ask M. Magellon if you can have my letters. I
  am sure that he has them in a large portfolio. Find out what they did with
  them at Bordeaux, and if you can find them, burn them without reading
  them.</p>

  <p class="letter">'Once more, forget me. Think of yourself&mdash;life must
  still have interest for you&mdash;your virtues must attach you to it. Adieu,
  despair has dried my heart and my soul; I no longer know how to express any
  sentiment. My death is only a proof of the manner in which I have loved M. de
  Mora&mdash;his showed that he responded to my tenderness more than you ever
  thought. Hélas! When you read this I shall be delivered from the burden that
  overwhelms me. Adieu, mon ami, adieu!</p>

  <p class="letter"
     style="font-variant:small-caps">'Lespinasse.'</p>

  <p class="letter">'A word of me to Madame Geoffrin. She loved my friend. I
  wish to be buried with the ring I wear. Send all these packets to their
  addresses. <i>Adieu, mon ami</i>, for ever.'</p><br>

  <p>'<i>Eh bien</i>,' said M. de Guibert again, handing back the letter. He
  was wondering if the ring to which Julie referred was his (given her in place
  of that which broke), or if she had changed her mind about that of M. de
  Mora. M. D'Alembert seemed to be making a supreme effort for self-control. He
  put the two papers in his pocket.</p>

  <p>'I sent you the desk she speaks of, Monsieur. Your letters you will find
  sealed and locked in the drawers as I found them, Monsieur.'</p>

  <p>The young man heard this news with considerable relief. He did not want
  any one to know of his relations with Julie de Lespinasse.</p>

  <p>'And this,' continued M. D'Alembert, 'is the black portfolio, and this the
  rose-coloured.' He indicated the two as they lay on the ottoman.</p>

  <p>Now that he had his own letters safe, M. de Guibert was not very
  interested in either. He was anxious to get away from this room over which
  hung the peculiar taint of death. The furniture looked quite shabby, and the
  disordered flowers gave forth a stale perfume. He recalled how her dying whim
  had been to change her lodging and take one nearer to him in the rue de
  Grammont.</p>

  <p>With quivering fingers, M. D'Alembert was fumbling at the locks of the two
  portfolios, then he suddenly turned and caught hold of M. de Guibert by the
  arm.</p>

  <p>'What manner of woman was this?' he asked in a terrible voice. The young
  man stared. Truly he did not know the answer. M. D'Alembert was transfigured
  by passion. Indignation, fury, and contempt made his insignificant person
  appear powerful and impressive.</p>

  <p>'Monsieur,' he cried, 'she was in love with the Marquis de Mora!'</p>

  <p>Self-control made M. de Guibert's face blank.</p>

  <p>'In love with M. de Mora!' repeated M. D'Alembert&mdash;'for years...there
  are the letters.'</p>

  <p>'She asked you to burn them,' murmured M. de Guibert.</p>

  <p>'I read them&mdash;after her last note to me in which she avows her
  affection, I read them.'</p>

  <p>'It was cruel of her not to have destroyed them,' said M. de Guibert, who
  was both abashed and embarrassed.</p>

  <p>M. D'Alembert did not seem to hear him. 'I wasted for her sixteen years of
  my life,' he said. 'She never loved me. I was her fool from the
  first&mdash;among all her letters, had she kept one of mine? Ungrateful and
  unhappy! She belonged to all the world sooner than to me...</p>

  <p>'Monsieur, monsieur&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Pity me,' said D'Alembert. 'Pity me, Monsieur. I loved her&mdash;she
  never loved me. I wasted sixteen years with her&mdash;I am sixty years
  old.'</p>

  <p>Speaking these words with passionate bitterness, he turned away to hide
  his distorted face, and his old, tired, and shuddering hands fingered the
  fatal portfolios.</p>

  <p>The young man looked with compassion at this intense and heartbroken grief
  that was as beyond his comprehension as the grief of Julie had been. He was
  amazed at D'Alembert's long self-deception, at the strength of his love, his
  depth of despair, and the supreme irony of his choice of a confidant.</p>

  <p>With an effort he forced himself to offer some consolation. 'M. D'Alembert
  has so many other friends who can fill the gap caused by this one who
  changed&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'She changed, Monsieur, but I did not. She was the charm of my life. There
  is nothing left for me but a frightful emptiness.' He lifted his poor worn
  eyes to the radiant face of the young man.</p>

  <p>'She was fond of you, monsieur, and you understood her. Let me keep your
  friendship for her sake. It would comfort me if I were capable of comfort,
  but all is lost for me. There is nothing left for me but to die.'</p>

  <p>'Do you not believe, Monsieur, in the immortality of the soul?'</p>

  <p>'Is there comfort in that?' Dead or alive she belongs to M. de Mora.'</p>

  <p>M. de Guibert turned away. He began to find the situation intolerable, and
  to echo in his heart the agonised cry of D'Alembert: 'What was this
  woman?'</p>

  <p>D'Alembert looked at him with the difficult and dreadful tears of old age
  glistening on his cheeks.</p>

  <p>'Monsieur...we will speak of her another time...now, I cannot command
  myself.'</p>

  <p>'Our silence should be her best monument,' said M. de Guibert. Monsieur,
  <i>adieu</i>.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Adieu</i>, Monsieur le Comte.' The young man glanced once more round
  the room he was never to see again, and at the despairing figure of
  D'Alembert broken with the passion of his wasted love, his wasted tears,
  going over the letters of the lover who, in his turn, had been betrayed. Then
  he took up his hat and left with a shudder and a sigh.</p>

  <p>He felt faintly sick, and thought of Julie with a vague physical horror.
  The day of her funeral he had written, after the present fashion, her
  portrait and her elegy&mdash;he could not have written it now.</p>

  <p>He walked through the May afternoon to his father-in-law's hotel in the
  rue de Grammont, where he was staying. With every step he took from the rue
  Saint-Dominique, his spirits rose. He had a charm in his heart potent against
  most griefs.</p>

  <p>He was in love at last, his errant passions held firmly and for ever, all
  his tenderness, all his sentiment absorbed by one creature, the demure, wise,
  and fragile beauty whom he had married for her dowry.</p>

  <p>In the course of a year Madame de Guibert had made him her lover and her
  slave.</p>

  <p>As soon as he reached home he wrote to her, using a language he had never
  employed to Julie de Lespinasse:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">...'It is nine days I am without thy news. It seems I am
  indeed fifty leagues from thee. These silences separate more than
  distances!... Ah! tell me again and often that thou lovest me! I cherish
  these repetitions, this disorder is the eloquence of the heart. That villain,
  Lépine, has not yet sent my watch, but I have thy portrait. I can truly say,
  with the Duchesse du Maine: "One marks the hours, the other causes them to be
  forgotten."'</p><br>

  <p>He was vexed when he was interrupted in his writing by the arrival of the
  desk that held his correspondence with Julie de Lespinasse.</p>
