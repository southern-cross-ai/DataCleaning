<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> following narrative, written shortly after
the occurrence of the events therein described, was intended for
immediate publication; but, on my arrival in England, being again
appointed Surgeon-Superintendent of a convict-ship, my sojourn at
home was so limited&mdash;not exceeding ten days&mdash;that I
could not carry my intention into effect; and having been, since
that period, unremittingly employed in the same service, I have
not had leisure to superintend the work through the Press until
the present time.&mdash;Moreover, concluding that the interest in
the subjects treated of, had greatly subsided, I abandoned all
idea of giving publicity to the manuscript.</p>
<br>
<p>The great desire, however, still manifested by the Public, to
obtain information relative to New Holland, has induced me to
alter my opinion; and I now therefore publish these pages, in the
hope that they may contain some information acceptable to those
interested in Australian affairs, and afford some amusement to
the general reader.</p>
<br>
<p>With the exception of an article in the Journal of the Royal
Geographical Society of last year, there has been no account yet
published, of Melville Island or Raffles Bay; and I still hope
that, notwithstanding the unfavourable issue of former trials,
the attention of the Government will be again directed to the
manifold advantages likely to result from colonizing the north
coast of New Holland: and should any remarks, which I have made,
tend to accelerate so desirable an event, it will afford me much
gratification.</p>
<br>
<p>Although the observations regarding Swan River, and King
George's Sound, have been, in a great measure, superseded by more
recent information; yet, as they give a sketch of these
settlements in their infancy, I have deemed it expedient to
retain them.</p>
<br>
<p>The remarks in the Appendix, relative to transportation,
&amp;c., may be entitled to some attention,&mdash;being derived
from an experience of eight voyages to Australia, during which, I
have had charge of nearly two thousand prisoners, without having
met with any difficulty, or disturbance, worth mentioning.</p>
<br>
<p>It was my intention to give a detailed account of New South
Wales and Van Diemen's Land; but as that subject has been so
recently and ably treated of, I have restricted myself to
offering a few words of advice to persons intending to become
settlers in these colonies, to whom the hints I have given may,
perhaps, prove advantageous.</p>

Town&mdash;Departure for Batavia&mdash;Attempted Passage round
Cape Leuwin unsuccessful&mdash;Bass's Straits&mdash;Wreck
Reef&mdash;Eastern Fields&mdash;Murray's Island&mdash;The
"Governor Ready" wrecked on a Coral Reef in Torres'
Straits&mdash;The Crew take to the Boats, intending to proceed to

<p><small>THE</small> ship "Governor Ready", 512 tons, was,
shortly after her arrival from Van Dieman's Land in 1828,
chartered by the Commissioners of the Navy, to convey 200 male
prisoners from Ireland to New South Wales; and being again
appointed surgeon-superintendent, I joined her on the 22d of July
in that year.</p>
<p>On the 17th of August the guards consisting of 50 men of the
63d regiment having embarked, and all being ready for sea, we
sailed from Deptford, and on the 27th arrived at the Cove of
Cork.</p>
<p>On the 18th of September 200 prisoners were received on board,
on the 21st we took our departure, and on the 17th of January,
1829, we arrived at Sydney, after a very pleasant passage, during
which the utmost harmony and quietness uninterruptedly
prevailed.</p>
<p>On the 26th all the prisoners were landed in good health.</p>
<p>After having spent a few weeks in New South Wales, the greater
part of which time I passed in excursions over the southern and
western settled districts of the Colony, I prepared to return to
England. There were several vessels in the harbour about to
depart for London direct, laden with colonial produce; but,
preferring the "Governor Ready", a ship in which I had spent many
happy days, I obtained permission from the Colonial Government to
return home in her, although she was to pursue rather a
circuitous route.</p>
<p>Previous to leaving England, it had been arranged that this
ship, after the debarkation of the prisoners at Sydney, should
proceed to the Isle of France, to receive a cargo of sugar; but
just as we were on the eve of leaving Sydney Cove, Captain Young
(who commanded the vessel) received intelligence of the failure
of the sugar crops there, which rendered it doubtful whether a
cargo would be in readiness; but, as the owners of the ship
(anxious to establish a direct commercial intercourse between the
two ports,) had sent another vessel in ballast from Bristol to
the Isle of France, with an intelligent supercargo, who had
instructions to purchase cargoes for both vessels, the hope that
he had succeeded, although diminished, was not entirely
destroyed.</p>
<p>To obtain more certain information relative to this matter,
and also to land several passengers; and, as little
inconvenience, expense, or delay, would be occasioned thereby, it
was deemed advisable to touch at the Derwent.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the 18th March, Capt. Young and myself
bade adieu to our friends at Sydney, and after a protracted pull
down the harbour, joined the ship, which, having been under weigh
since day-light, was lying-to for us inside the heads of Port
Jackson.</p>
<p>We had a favourable and pleasant passage to Hobart Town, where
we arrived on the evening of the 25th. From information received
there, the idea of proceeding to the Isle of France was
abandoned; the sugar had not been purchased, and the wholesale
London dealers in that commodity had written to prohibit their
agents in that Island from shipping any freight by the "Governor
Ready", in consequence, I believe, of the following
circumstance:&mdash;During her passage home last year, from the
Isle of France, deeply (perhaps too deeply) laden with sugar, the
ship encountered a tremendous gale of wind off the Island of
Madagascar, and from the immense quantity of water shipped, much
of the cargo was damaged; and as great prejudice exists in London
against vessels built at Prince Edward's Island, the "Governor
Ready" (built there) having spoiled her cargo was a circumstance
not to be overlooked, and therefore she was unjustly singled out
as an unsafe and unseaworthy vessel.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* We were obliged to put in at the Cape of Good
Hope to get the damage of the ship repaired. The day previous to
our leaving Table Bay, two ships, (British built I believe,) the
"Mellish" and "Ferguson", reached there in a sad plight, having
been dismasted on the same day, by the same gale, within a few
miles of us. The ship "Woodlark" foundered this year in nearly
the same place, lat. 28&deg;. 8'. S. long. 52&deg;. 40'. E. and
within two days of the same time, February 11th, having
encountered the same kind of weather that we did. Had the
"Woodlark" been as staunch as the "Governor Ready", she might, in
like manner, have weathered out the gale.]</p>
<p>Thus circumstanced, Captain Young made up his mind to proceed
to Batavia. This change was not altogether agreeable to me,
having on a former occasion suffered much both from shipwreck and
disease, near and at the Island of Java; but I made up my mind
not to leave the ship, and it required some effort on my part to
persevere in this resolution, as I was solicited to embark in the
"Mermaid", (commanded by an old friend and mess-mate of mine,
Captain Henniker,) which was on the point of sailing for England
direct, <i>via</i> Cape Horn.</p>
<p>At daylight on the 2d of April we got under weigh, and gliding
down the river, under the influence of a stiff breeze, Hobart
Town and its singularly romantic environs soon receded from our
view. As the wind was blowing strongly from the westward, we
proposed going through D'Entrecasteaux's channel, so that, should
the wind continue to blow with undiminished force from the same
quarter, we might anchor near the southern entrance, and there be
in readiness for the first favourable slant to carry us round the
south-west Cape of Van Dieman's Land. The wind, however, having
shifted a little to the northward, and the barometer indicating
moderate weather, we entered Storm Bay, and were soon once more
on the mighty Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>The season was rather too far advanced for us to expect a
favourable passage round Cape Leuwin; but as, according to
Horsburgh's Directory, good passages had occasionally been
effected as late, and even later, it was considered prudent to
make the attempt, more especially as it was too early in the
season for passing through Torres' Straits, a route, under the
most favourable circumstances, beset with intricacy and
danger.</p>
<p>Influenced by these considerations, we purposed to beat to
windward; but the ship being very light&mdash;hardly in ballast
trim&mdash;it was not expected that much progress could be made
to the westward until the wind became more favourable. In anxious
expectation of this wished-for event, we kept contending with
adverse gales and tempestuous seas, being encouraged to persevere
by an occasional northerly breeze, until the 23d of April, when,
having only reached the 131st degree of east longitude, after
having sustained much loss of canvas and other damage, our
patience deserted us, more especially as the hope of obtaining a
fair wind diminished daily: inasmuch as winter was
advancing&mdash;the season when westerly winds prevail.</p>
<p>All circumstances being maturely considered, it was decided,
that to persevere longer in endeavouring to get round Cape Leuwin
would be worse than useless; the attempt, therefore, was
abandoned. Accordingly at 5 <small>P.M.</small> of the 23d the
helm was put up, and all hands called to square yards, an order
obeyed with much alacrity, the sailors having been greatly
harassed and fatigued ever since our departure from Van Dieman's
Land by constant work in making or shortening sail, according to
the state of the weather, the vicissitudes of which were sudden
and severe.</p>
<p>To be scudding under easy sail, after such continued uproar,
was felt to be an agreeable change, although we could not help
feeling that we were running from a boisterous, into a smoother,
but much more dangerous, sea. The ship was not provided with
charts of the north coast of New Holland, (the first sheet of
Minder's north coast excepted,) nor of the Indian Archipelago, as
it was not contemplated, on leaving England, that they would be
required. This circumstance was untoward; but knowing that we
should have opportunities of ascertaining our true position from
lunar observations, and determining to keep a good look out, we
hoped to get safely through the dangers which abounded in the
route we were now compelled to pursue.</p>
<p>On the 27th we made Cape Otway; and while passing through
Bass's Straits we found, from the cross bearings of several
islets, that the chronometer deviated widely from the truth: it
was, therefore, evident that no reliance could prudently be
placed on the longitude thus ascertained; this circumstance,
however, caused us no uneasiness, being fortunately favoured with
other and unerring celestial time-keepers.</p>
<p>We had scarcely got round Cape Howe when the wind shifted to
the northward, and, after two days fruitlessly spent in standing
off and on, we stretched out to the eastward until we obtained a
favourable breeze. On the 6th of May we passed the parallel of
Port Jackson, in longitude 157&deg; 30', when, the wind being
still fair, we shaped a course, so as to pass close to the
eastward of Cato's bank. At noon, on the 9th, we were one mile
north, and ten miles east of it, according to chronometer
corrected from Kent's group; but satisfactory lunar observations
placed us twenty miles farther to the eastward. The course was,
therefore, altered a little more to the westward, that we might
obtain a sight of "Bird Islet" on Wreck Reef, in compliance with
the generally received opinion, that every vessel bound through
Torres' Straits by the outer passage ought to do so; as, from the
position of Wreck Reef being well known, a good opportunity is
thereby afforded of comparing the chronometer.</p>
<p>At midnight we had passed Bird Islet, as the latitude was
ascertained to be 22&deg;. 9' south, by the meridian altitudes of
several stars taken, in the order of their culmination between a
little before ten and midnight, and reduced to the latter hour.**
As we possessed, or at least believed that we did possess, the
only information to be gained by a sight of Bird Islet,
<i>i.e.</i>, the exact position of the ship, we concluded that it
would be wasting time to lie-to till daylight, more especially as
the night was clear and the breeze favourable. We therefore
proceeded on our course, which was now directed for Diana's
Bank.</p>
<p class="foot">[** I am thus minute, for the purpose of showing
that Captain Young paid uncommon attention to the navigation of
his ship, far more so indeed than is usual with the generality of
masters of merchant vessels.]</p>
<p>I may here mention that as soon as we passed the tropic, and
entered into a sea bestrewed with coral reefs and sand-banks,
every measure, which prudence could dictate or caution suggest,
was adopted to insure a constant and careful look-out. Every one
acquainted with inter-tropical navigation must be aware from
experience that it is very difficult for a person keeping
"watch-and-watch" to be sufficiently alert, especially in sultry
weather. Three watches were, therefore, formed, each under the
charge of two officers, one of whom was stationed on the poop,
and the other on the forecastle: a trust-worthy sailor was also
to keep a look-out from the forecastle, and another from the
foreyard&mdash;the latter to be relieved every half hour: due
care being thus taken to guard against dangers known and unknown,
we cautiously but confidently, kept under sail even during the
night.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the 10th., the breeze blew strongly from the
S.E., attended with frequent showers, and a completely obscured
sky. Towards the evening, the clouds dispersed, the wind became
lighter, and throughout the night the sky continued clear. At
eight o'clock, <small>P.M.</small> of the 11th, we were in the
parallel of Diana's Bank. A few minutes afterwards, the watch on
the forecastle called out, "breakers on the lee-bow", and "right
a-head!" This intelligence caused considerable alarm. The ship
was instantly hove in the wind: some declared they not only saw
broken water, but the land very distinctly, and pretended to
point it out to others, who were rather sceptical, yet, after the
most careful inspection, neither the one nor the other could be
perceived. The panic having subsided, we resumed our course
direct for the Eastern Fields, and at one o'clock in the morning
of the 15th, being in latitude 10&deg; 12' and in longitude
146&deg; 20' east, we shortened sail, expecting to be up with
these reefs by day-break.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, however, it fell calm, and continued so
till next morning, when the breeze sprung up; and at seven,
<small>A.M.</small>, we descried the "Eastern Fields" right
a-head: at noon we were in latitude 10&deg; 2' and, by lunar
observations, brought forward by chronometer, in longitude
145&deg; 49'; the north-east extremity of the reef (which,
according to Flinders, is in latitude 10&deg; 2' and longitude
145&deg; 45') bearing west; distant from two to three miles. The
chronometer placed us forty-two miles too far west.* It afforded
us much gratification to find the observations, which we had
taken so frequently, and with great care, prove so correct; as we
could now with confidence lay down on the chart our true track,
(where we neither met nor saw either reefs or shoals, or
sand-banks,) which might prove of considerable utility to others
who might hereafter pursue the same route.</p>
<p class="foot">[* I believe that many islands, islets, and
reefs, said to be new discoveries, are not so&mdash;that they
have been already described&mdash;and supposed new through too
much reliance being placed on the chronometer; several instances
of this are within my own knowledge. In the present instance, had
we trusted to the chronometer, this reef (the Eastern Fields)
would doubtlessly have been considered as hitherto unknown.]</p>
<p>Shortly after noon the wind became light and variable; during
the night it blew from the westward, consequently we got to the
ripplings to the northward of the reef, and experienced an
easterly current, which retarded our progress considerably. On
the 17th, towards evening, a steady breeze again blew from the
south-east, and we made all sail with the intention of being up
to the Barrier Reef betimes in the morning; and as we should most
probably pass between Boot Beef and Portlock Reef some time in
the middle watch, a knowledge of our latitude was an object of
the utmost importance.</p>
<p>Fortunately, having fine weather and a cloudless sky, our
latitude could be, and was, ascertained almost every half hour,
by the meridian altitude of a star, either north or south of the
zenith, and by the distance of the Moon from Jupiter and Altair
to the east; and from Saturn and Regulus to the west, we inferred
our longitude. During the early part of the middle watch, the
sound of breakers was distinctly heard on both sides of the ship.
About three, <small>A.M.</small>, our latitude by Rastaban and
Vega, agreeing with that deduced previously from the meridian
altitude of Jupiter, the Moon, and sixteen Stars, was 9&deg; 51'
south, and our longitude by lunars, brought forward by
chronometer, was 144&deg; 38'.</p>
<p>Having thus passed safely between these reefs, we were rather
elated by being the first (as far as our knowledge extended) who
had made the attempt during the night. We kept on our course
under easy sail till day-light, when, as expected, we saw
Murray's Island, and shortly afterwards, the great Barrier Reef,
through which we entered by an opening about 100 fathoms wide,
Murray's Island bearing W.S.W.</p>
<p>Imagining we could reach Half-way Island long before sun-set,
we did not stop at Murray's Island; greatly to the disappointment
of the natives, many of whom were seen running along the beach,
and inviting us, by every means in their power to stay. I regret,
individually, that I had not an opportunity of renewing an
acquaintance formed with several of these interesting islanders
some years ago.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** Vide Appendix.]</p>
<p>We proceeded on, following nearly the "Cumberland's" track;
the captain and chief mate keeping a good look-out from the
fore-yard; the other officers attending to the manoeuvring of the
ship, while a person, who had some previous knowledge of the
passage, attended to the wheel.</p>
<p>About one, <small>P.M.</small>, being in the fair channel,
under the influence of a strong breeze, and the tide in our
favour, we pursued our serpentine and perilous course with much
rapidity; and, guided only by the colour of the water, passed
many sand-banks and reefs in safety, until 2.45
<small>P.M.</small>, when the ship struck with such force on a
small detached coral reef, that the rock penetrated instantly
through her bottom! There was no occasion for sounding the well,
the encroaching water, in a few minutes up to the lower deck,
affording us a melancholy proof of the extensive and irremediable
damage that the ship had sustained.</p>
<p>Thus, suddenly and unexpectedly, in broad day-light, after
having, by unremitted attention and care, passed the most
dangerous parts of this intricate passage, were all our hopes
utterly annihilated.</p>
<p>It now only remained for us to consider by what means we might
have a chance of saving our lives. After as much deliberation as
such disastrous circumstances would admit of, the only mode that
appeared to us to hold out any prospect of success, was&mdash;to
endeavour to reach some European settlement in the boats: the
nearest to us, of whose situation we had any certain knowledge,
was Melville Island, which, we had heard, previously to leaving
Sydney, was about to be abandoned. We determined, however, to
touch there in the first instance, and should we find it
deserted, we made up our minds to endeavour to get to Coupang,
the principal establishment of the Dutch on the island of Timor,
where Captain Bligh was so hospitably received, after his
miraculous escape in the "Bounty's" launch.</p>
<p>The ship's company being assembled on the quarter-deck, a
short address was made to them, explanatory of what was intended
to be attempted for the general good. When it was understood that
we must proceed at least 900 miles in the boats, through, to us,
an unknown sea, before we could reach the nearest probable place
of obtaining succour, many of them,&mdash;those particularly who
had wives and children,&mdash;began to despair; they were rallied
out of their despondency, and as there were several intelligent
men among the crew, they were invited to give their opinion
relating to our ulterior proceedings. But they unanimously
declined doing so, and assured us of their readiness, not only to
abide implicitly by our decision, but also to obey all orders
which might be given, with as much promptitude as they had done
prior to the shipwreck, being, as they said, well aware, that by
such conduct only, could they have any reasonable hope of being
delivered from their present perilous situation.</p>
<p>Our boats, three in number, were now hoisted out; two of them,
the skiff and jolly-boat, were fitted with sails, and in every
other respect in good order: the long boat, not having been out
of the ship since she left Sydney in October 1827, and not
having, during the interval, received any repairs, (particularly
caulking, of which she stood much in need,) was far from being in
a fit state for the present unexpected service. As regarded our
distribution in the different boats, it was at first proposed to
draw lots, but it was finally arranged that the Captain and
myself should go in the long boat, the first mate and the
sailmaker in the skiff, and the second mate and the boatswain in
the jolly-boat. The Captain and mates choosing the remainder of
the crew alternately, in the same manner as is customary in
forming a watch.</p>
<p>In this manner, then, were we divided; nineteen in the long
boat, twelve in the skiff, and eight in the jolly boat; and it
was agreed that we should keep close company, that we might
afford assistance to each other in case of necessity; being
determined to be saved, or to perish together.</p>
<p>Our attention was now naturally drawn to reflect on what ought
to be taken in the boats; and lest any individual, from misguided
self-interest, should take with him private property, to the
exclusion of that which was necessary for the public good, it was
suggested, that nothing of the kind should be permitted, and no
opposition was offered to this prudent arrangement. It was,
therefore, directed that only such articles necessary either for
the sustenance of life. or for self-defence, or for our guidance,
were to be taken. In the long boat were placed three casks of
water, also some biscuit, salt beef, pork, hams, and cheese, tea
and sugar, a small keg of brandy, a few cooking utensils, a
lantern, a few candles, a tinder-box and matches, a keg of
gunpowder, some muskets and cutlasses; the chronometer, sextants,
quadrants, a compass, and necessary books of navigation; a
top-gallant studding sail boom, and a fore royal, were also
thrown into her, for a mast and sail: a little canvas, tarpaulin,
and some deal boards, were not forgotten: and the carpenter was
enjoined to take such of his tools as might prove useful. The
skiff and jolly-boat had their barrels filled with water, and
each was provided with a compass: there was a sextant in one and
a quadrant in the other; and with the exception of their not
being lumbered with provisions, which we were to issue to them
from time to time, they were similarly supplied with other
necessary and useful articles.</p>
<p>Matters being thus arranged, a few effects belonging to
individuals, (<i>i.e.</i>, blankets and wearing apparel, in a
limited quantity,) were permitted to be put on board their
respective boats. At this time some of the sailors who had
managed, notwithstanding all our precautions, to get access to
the spirits, of which they had freely partaken, requested they
might have a little grog to support their strength, sagely
remarking that, although too much would prove injurious, a little
could not possibly do them any harm. This request, however,
although backed with such a powerful argument, was decidedly
refused; and on their showing a disposition to argue the point,
rather insubordinately, they were reminded of their promise, made
only a very short time before, of implicit obedience; which
would, if necessary, be strictly and fearlessly enforced. This
rebuke had the desired effect of making them desist from further
importunity, and measures were taken to remove all chance of
their obtaining any more spirits clandestinely.</p>
<p>The ship was now gradually going down a-stern, and fears were
entertained that she might suddenly slip off the rock and sink in
deep water.</p>
<p>From having been formerly placed in a similar situation, I had
no apprehension of such a result; on the contrary, I thought that
if no particularly bad weather occurred, she would perhaps remain
nearly in the same state, till the change of the monsoon; the
Captain coincided in this opinion, and it was thought advisable
to remain on board until the morning.</p>
<p>After having assisted in the arrangement of all matters
connected with our safety, I retired to my cabin, and while
employed there, in selecting some papers and other small
articles, which I wished, if possible, to preserve, one of the
sailors, on whose judgment I placed some reliance, came hurriedly
in, and begged me to come instantly into the boat, as the ship
was rapidly going down; this intelligence, although contrary to
my own opinion, was not to be neglected, especially as the water
was now up to the cabin windows. On coming out, I found every
one, excepting the Captain, in the greatest alarm; all dreading
that the ship would suddenly slip off the rock, and drag the
boats down with her, thereby rendering our escape impossible, and
our destruction inevitable.</p>
<p>Although the Captain and myself were still persuaded that
there was no immediate danger of such an accident, yet, in
acquiescence with the general wish, the order was given, which
there was no occasion to repeat, for all hands to go into the
boats; and we left, with sorrowful hearts, the ship that had
conveyed us in safety through stormy seas, so many thousand
miles, just as the sun,&mdash;emblematic of her fate,&mdash;had
sunk in the western wave.</p>

<p class="negindent"><small>Intention to remain a short time by
the ship frustrated&mdash;Voyage in the boats

Booby Island&mdash;Progress obstructed by reefs and
sandbanks&mdash;Discover a group of islets&mdash;Land on one of

<p><small>AS</small> it would have been imminently dangerous to
proceed in the boats during the night, we decided to keep close
to the ship till break of day. Accordingly, the boats were made
fast to each other, and the long-boat attached to the flying
gib-boom by a rope of considerable length, which one of our party
was in readiness to cut, should the ship go down. The advantage
of the caution used in loading the boats was now apparent; the
gunwale of the long-boat being within a very little distance of
the water, and she was leaking so much, that it required the
constant labour of two hands to keep her free; but we hoped she
would <i>take up</i> before morning.</p>
<p>Being now in a state of inaction, we had time to reflect on
our altered situation. A few hours ago, we were in the enjoyment
of every comfort compatible with a seafaring life,&mdash;a
justly-grounded prospect of an agreeable and prosperous voyage,
and, at no distant period, a happy meeting with our friends in
our native land:&mdash;now, our only hope of personal safety
depended on a leaky boat, necessarily overloaded, an intricate
and dangerous navigation around us, many hundred miles distant
from the nearest abode of civilised man! Our misfortunes,
however, pressed less heavily, in consequence of there being no
females to share them.</p>
<p>To others differently situated, the night might have appeared
exceedingly beautiful, as the moon, and her starry train, shone
with that splendour peculiar to the torrid zone; but to us it was
long and dreary, and we hailed with delight the first appearance
of dawning day. In the morning. Captain Young and myself went on
board. I was anxious to save some manuscripts and other papers of
value, but the sea having taken possession of my cabin, rendered
the attempt useless. As the alarm, caused by the apprehension
that the ship would suddenly sink, had subsided, several of the
sailors came on board, ostensibly for the purpose of obtaining a
little more rope, canvass, and wood; but their real design (to
search for spirits) being suspected, was soon perceived and
prevented.</p>
<p>It was our intention to remain by the ship for a short time,
to put the long-boat in some order, and to fit her with sails;
but, being convinced that no good was to be expected from the
sailors while spirits were within their reach,&mdash;to prevent
the fatal consequences that might ensue from longer delay, it was
deemed expedient to defer these necessary operations till our
arrival at Half-way Island. All on board were therefore ordered
to come into the boats instantly; but the order, although we
showed the example, not being obeyed with so much alacrity as it
was last evening, we threatened to depart without them, and had
actually shoved off; they then quitted the ship with reluctant
speed, without having obtained either their apparent or real
object. To the general credit of the crew, however, I ought to
mention that only a very few acted in this manner&mdash;by far
the greater number conducting themselves with becoming
steadiness&mdash;yet it was not deemed prudent to trust too much
to their self-denial in this respect.</p>
<p>Although many disheartening circumstances conspired to render
the issue of our enterprise a matter of great uncertainty, yet
being aware that despondency could only make bad worse, we
commenced with confidence our perilous voyage, invoking the aid
of Divine Providence, by whose protecting influence we might be
shielded from the numerous and varied dangers that were and would
be continually hovering around us. Our course was directed to
Half-way Island; and the breeze being fresh, our ruined ship soon
receded through the growing waters&mdash;all of us casting many a
"lingering look behind",&mdash;until her loftiest sails, yet
fluttering in the wind, were hid from view by the horizon, now
beautifully adorned by the rays of the rising sun.</p>
<p>After having passed a reef of some extent, which was left on
the larboard hand, we experienced a south-easterly swell, and as
we had to haul more up, the spray dashed incessantly over us,
rendering us not only very uncomfortable, but doing much injury,
particularly to the biscuit.</p>
<p>About eleven o'clock, <small>A.M.</small>, we reached the
island, and our first care was to spread out the biscuit to dry;
those who were in the other boats followed our example, although
some thoughtless youngsters, being about to amuse themselves, as
if on a party of pleasure, had to be reminded of their duty. As
our mast, the top-gallant studding-sail boom, had already been
sprung, it was <i>fished</i> with an oar; and our boat was
fitted, in a temporary way, with a tarpawling bulwark.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the cook was busy in the exercise of his
vocation; a fire was kindled, and a pig (two having found their
way into the boat) was killed, and dressed for dinner; to which
we assembled with keen appetites, in a romantic spot, shaded from
the sun by the luxuriant foliage of a natural grove. The
resemblance, in some respects, to a pic-nic party, tended to
exhilarate our spirits; and the sailors, who in general have much
repugnance to alloy present enjoyment by any cares about the
future, were quite happy and jocose.</p>
<p>Dinner being finished, we prepared to renew our journey. In
case of accidental separation, a week's provisions were issued to
the skiff and jolly-boat, and it was judged prudent to divide at
once the brandy equally to the boats, according to the number of
persons in each. To do this equitably, it behoved us to collect
all that might be in the other boats, for we had only a very
small quantity in the long-boat, in consequence of the
unaccountable disappearance of a five-gallon keg full.</p>
<p>A good deal of ill humour was manifested by the officer in
charge of one of the boats, when requested to increase the
general stock, by the production of a considerable quantity which
he had snugly stowed away for particular service. He was very
reluctant to give it up, insisting that, <i>de jure</i>, it was
his own property. However that might be, it was, <i>ex
necessitate rei</i>, added to the common stock, which was then
divided, with strict impartiality, as were also a few bottles of
wine and porter, which had been placed in our boat by the
steward. The biscuit, being now dry, was put into bags, and
protected as much as possible from future damage, by being
covered with tarpawling.</p>
<p>Every thing being placed in the boats, about six,
<small>P.M.</small>, we left this islet. Perhaps we acted rather
imprudently, by not remaining until the morning; but, as we could
not procure any water here, and as it was in other respects
inconvenient, we were anxious to get forward to Booby Island,
where we purposed to complete our arrangements, and which it was
expected we should reach next evening. We shaped our course for
Wednesday Island, and directed the other boats to keep ahead, as
they drew much less water. However, they, in a very short time,
fell astern, and we led the way, keeping a sharp look out, to
avoid reefs and sand-banks.</p>
<p>About eight o'clock, we were alarmed by repeated reports of
musketry; our sail was instantly lowered, and in a few minutes we
saw both boats, and learned that all was well, and that the
firing had proceeded from the jolly-boat, the crew of which, it
appeared, had imprudently drunk their whole allowance of
spirits.</p>
<p>About midnight, land, apparently a small island, was
discovered,* bearing west. We hauled to the northward, and soon
perceived another island on our larboard beam, and a third on our
larboard bow. We had not continued our course for to the
northward, when the well known and dreaded sound of breakers was
distinctly heard right a-head. We instantly wore, and stood to
the southward, intending to pass between the first and second
islands, by a passage that appeared two or three miles wide; but
it being probable that the channel might be strewed with reefs;
and the moon only affording a very dubious light,&mdash;rendered
more deceitful by a hazy atmosphere,&mdash;it was, on
deliberation, considered more prudent to stand off and on, in
sight of the first made island, until break of day.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In the first instance, we imagined this to be
Mount Adolphus, but it was not so. From the haziness of the
atmosphere, and the horizon being undefined, we could not
ascertain our latitude from the altitude of any of the stars, and
although the attempt was made, the result could not be depended
on.]</p>
<p>At length the wished-for morning appeared, and discovered to
us three islands, low and woody, in the same meridian; and from
the northernmost a reef, from which we had during the night so
narrowly escaped, extending to the eastward as far as the eye
could reach.</p>
<p>As the channel between the southern and middle islands
appeared the best, we determined to pass through it, and directed
the other boats to precede us; but instead of doing so, they fell
into our wake. We found the passage deep, and free from reefs.
Two natives were seen running along the starboard shore,
seemingly, by their gestures, intreating us to land; but we
passed on, without taking advantage of their apparently earnest
invitation.</p>
<p>We had only proceeded a short distance, when two islands were
descried, which, from their appearance and relative position,
were supposed to be Double and Wednesday Islands; to the latter
we directed our course, and about eleven o'clock passed within a
mile of its northern extremity. Then, in accordance with
Horsburgh's directions, we steered W.N.W. to avoid a dangerous
reef; but we had not advanced far in this direction, when a high
peaked hill came into view; and very shortly afterwards,
continuous and relatively low land was discovered, trending to
the north, and also to the south-west of it. We were obliged to
haul up S.S.W. before the visible extremity of the latter bore on
our starboard bow.</p>
<p>We were now greatly embarrassed, and in much doubt respecting
our position, which, as noon was fast approaching, and the sky
overcast, there did not seem to be any probability of
ascertaining: to add to our uneasiness, the rain fell in heavy
and frequent showers, accompanied by strong squalls, which were
driving us nearer than agreeable to the lee-shore, on which we
could discern the sea breaking heavily.</p>
<p>Contrary to expectation, however, the sun burst through the
clouds at noon, as if on purpose to show his meridian altitude,
and then withdrew. Having ascertained our latitude to be 10&deg;
16' south, we were convinced of what we had before conjectured,
that the land on our lee was Banks' Island.** We stood on, and
succeeded in weathering its south-western point; and then we
observed that it trended to the north-west.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Previously to our latitude being thus
satisfactorily known, we suspected that we had got to the
northward, and that the peaked hill to the westward was Mount
Augustus, but our latitude being 10&deg; 16', and the hitherto
supposed Wednesday Island bearing at this time to the northward
of east, according with its latitude as laid down in Horsburgh's
Directory, and in Lynn's Tables, we were completely puzzled. We
did not imagine that these books could be both erroneous in this
respect. Such, however, is the fact; Wednesday Island being in
latitude 10&deg; 30', in place of 10&deg; 10', as it is laid down
in both these justly esteemed publications. Pole's Island (that
which we supposed Wednesday Island) is in latitude 10&deg; 10'
exactly.]</p>
<p>In a short time, the sea, which had hitherto been turbulent,
became suddenly as smooth as a mill-pond, which convinced us that
we were in the vicinity of reefs; and it was not long before an
extensive sand-bank impeded our farther progress. We altered our
course S.W., W., and N.W., running along the edge of the shoal,
which extended farther than the eye could reach in a parallel
direction with Banks' Island. A scattered group of islands,
unknown to us, to the westward, being now in sight, we, (being
foiled in our attempt to reach Booby Island, and our boat having
become more leaky,) determined to take shelter near one of them,
and should it afford us water, to complete our arrangements
there.</p>
<p>We made several attempts to find a passage through this
extensive reef, without success, but at length, by perseverance
and caution, we happily found a way by a long, narrow, and
tortuous channel, from one to two fathoms deep; and about five
o'clock, <small>P.M.</small>, we leaped ashore on a fine sandy
beach, in a small bay, on the north side of an island situated
nearly in the centre of the group; and we were soon joined by the
other boats, which had cautiously kept in our wake.</p>
<p>We all rejoiced to be once again on shore, and our first care
was to search for water. The Captain and myself proceeded to a
spot that seemed, by the freshness of the surrounding vegetation,
to indicate the presence of that inestimable fluid, and, in a few
minutes, to our great satisfaction, we discovered a large
reservoir as clear as crystal, and of excellent quality. Having
been, since the shipwreck, on very short allowance of this
necessary of life, we indulged in copious and unrestrained
potations; and then took a run along the shore to stretch our
limbs, which were dreadfully stiff and cramped, by the confined
posture in the boat.</p>
<p>A pleasing instance occurred here, of the effect of our
conduct at Half-way Island. One of the officers came, by request
of those in the boat of which he had charge, to mention, that
having found a keg of brandy, they wished to deliver it up for
general distribution. Although we suspected that, as in the other
boat, it had been purposely secreted, the keg bearing a strong
resemblance to that which had so unaccountably disappeared from
us,&mdash;yet, gratified by their repentance, we gave them due
praise for their disinterested conduct.</p>
<p>To those who are acquainted with a sailor's predilection for a
glass of grog, and of his not being fastidiously particular, at
times, as to the mode of obtaining it, their conduct, in this
instance, must appear a convincing proof of what may be effected
by strict impartiality.</p>
<p>The cook having got his utensils on shore, soon provided us
with boiling water, and we enjoyed our tea, not feeling the want
of sugar, which the salt water had completely destroyed. Being
all fatigued, and inclined to sleep, we made preparations to
retire to rest. Directions were given to keep the boats afloat,
and arrangements were entered into to guard against the possible
consequences of sudden surprise; and also to receive, in a
friendly way, any of the natives who, from curiosity, or from any
other cause, might pay us a visit during our slumbers. Captain
Young, and myself, chose a spot, protected from the night-wind by
a large block of granite, and within a short distance of
high-water-mark, where&mdash;our bed the sand,&mdash;our canopy
the sky,&mdash;we were soon lulled asleep by the soothing sound
of the hollow breeze, and the mournful melody of the murmuring
sea.</p>
<p>Nothing occurred during the night to disturb us, and we did
not awake till daylight, when we found ourselves much renovated
by our uninterrupted repose. At an early hour we assembled, and
partook of breakfast, consisting of cocoa, biscuit, and delicious
oysters, which were found here, and caught in abundance at low
water.</p>
<p>The receding tide having left the boats a-ground, the
carpenter's first care was, to examine into the state of the
long-boat. His report was exceedingly unfavourable. Besides
standing much in need of caulking, and other repairs, it was
discovered that the worms had committed sad havoc, several of the
planks in her bottom being in an alarmingly decayed state, from
their depredations. In short, the carpenter was afraid to meddle
with her, lest he might make affairs worse,&mdash;but it was
absolutely necessary that something should be done. We had no
pitch, but we had a considerable quantity of oakum, and the
carpenter was directed to chintz the worst places very gently,
and afterwards to apply some tallow, and then to nail canvas over
all. These operations being completed, he was to fix the
tarpawling bulwark in a more secure and efficient manner, that we
might be protected from the disagreeable intrusion of the spray.
The other boats being in good order, and well-found, only
required a bulwark, or railing, to render them completely
sea-worthy.</p>
<p>The sail-makers were directed to convert the fore-royal into a
lug-sail, and to make a jib from some spare canvas, that we might
be enabled to make progress on a wind. The remainder of the crew
were employed variously: some were picking bread, others filling
water, some gathering oysters, and others cruizing about, in
search of adventures, or amusing themselves with the loquacious
prattle of a favourite cockatoo, which had been, by general
consent, permitted to accompany us.</p>
<p>The Captain and his officers took several observations of the
sun's altitude, which they were enabled to do by walking to the
north-east side of the island. As the western extremity of
Mulgrave Island bore due north of us, distant six or eight miles,
and as no other land in that direction intervened, the sky being
clear, and the horizon distinctly defined, we were enabled to
obtain the meridian altitude of the sun to a great nicety; and
the latitude thence deduced, by means of three observers, with
well-adjusted sextants, was 10&deg; 13' 27" south.</p>
<p>The carpenter and sail-makers having been very industrious,
had completed their labours early in the afternoon; and we
contemplated, with satisfaction, our worm-eaten boat, pretty well
patched up, and properly fitted with a lug-sail and jib, a
bowsprit having been formed from an oar. The bulwark, although
grotesque and rude, was firmly attached by stanchions, formed
from boughs of a species of pandanus, which, without knowing, or
indeed caring, whether or not we were botanically correct, we
named, on that account, <i>pandanus utilis</i>.</p>
<p>Several altitudes of the sun were taken in the afternoon, to
check and to compare with those taken in the morning; thence to
ascertain the apparent time with greater accuracy. The bread
having been carefully dried and picked, was stowed away in the
boat, and protected from the wet beneath, by dunnage; and from
the rain or spray; by tarpawling; while that which was beginning
to spoil was kept for present use.</p>
<p>These things being all arranged, we assembled at dinner,
consisting of salt beef, fresh pork, and abundance of oysters;
and it was deemed advisable, in consequence of most of us having
been exposed to the rays of a powerful sun, to issue a double
allowance of grog. The sailors, with characteristic levity, were
in high glee, and quite delighted with their fare.</p>
<p>Dinner being finished, and the sun's horizontal rays not being
oppressive. Captain Young, his officers, and myself, climbed to
the highest part of the island, and took a general view of those
adjacent, and observed their relative bearings, by an azimuth
compass. On returning, we were saluted with the glad tidings that
the long-boat, now afloat, leaked very little.</p>
<p>In the evening we re-assembled, when a short address was made
to the sailors, explanatory of our projected future proceedings.
The dangers, that might reasonably be expected to befall us
during the way, were pointed out, and also the means of averting
or combating them successfully; the sailors were complimented on
their hitherto general good conduct, which it was hoped would
continue to merit praise, as influencing materially the
favourable issue of our enterprise.</p>
<p>The scene was impressive and picturesque;&mdash;the numerous
blazing fires, which the sailors had for pastime kindled along
the shore, completely illumined the small bay in which the boats,
all ready for departure, were now floating, and threw a lurid
glare on the hardy, weather-worn countenances of the assembled
group, who were ever and anon reminded of their unenviable
situation, by a sudden blast of the breeze, or a sullen
threatening roar of the ruthless sea.&mdash;Place, time, and
circumstances, thus conspiring to excite and cherish gloomy
ideas, those who looked beyond the present moment could not avoid
being somewhat depressed, in spite of every effort to be, as well
as to appear, cheerful and unconcerned.</p>
<p>Watches were placed in situations commanding a good look out,
with directions how to act, should any strangers make their
appearance during the night,&mdash;precautionary measures to
prevent surprise, being now rendered doubly necessary; as it was
reasonable to suppose, that the natives, (distinct and recent
traces of whom had been observed during the day,) might be
attracted to the spot by the fires, which were blazing in all
directions around us. After these arrangements, we severally
betook ourselves to rest.</p>
<p>The spot where the Captain and myself slept last night, had
been, by the care of some of our comrades, converted into a very
pretty bower,&mdash;branches of trees being interwoven on the
east and west sides of the rock, the ensign spread over the top,
soft twigs strewed on the sand, and the whole ornamented with
various flowers. We were pleased with this spontaneous attention,
and slept soundly till about two o'clock in the morning, when we
got up, for the purpose of making some observations, with a view
to determine the longitude; the distance between "Jupiter" and
the Moon's remote, and between "Fomalhaut" and her near limb,
were measured carefully several times; and the observations thus
made being reserved for calculation, when time and place might be
more convenient, the observers resumed their repose till the dawn
of day.</p>
<p>As soon as daylight appeared, preparations were made for our
departure; before embarking, I recommended, both by precept and
example, a long swim,&mdash;to exercise and fatigue the limbs,
now about to be cramped and confined for some time. We also
thought it not amiss to take a good breakfast, which the cooks,
who had been early at work, had prepared for us. This being
finished, every utensil capable of containing water was filled
therewith; and all being properly arranged in the boats, about
six o'clock, <small>A.M.</small>, of the 22d of May, we left the
island, not without regret, yet pleased, that we should no longer
be annoyed with reefs and sand-banks. Not wishing to run the risk
of finding a clear passage between any of the islands, we steered
to the northward of the group,* and then directed our course W.
by S. across the gulf of Carpentaria.</p>
<p class="foot">[* This group consists of fourteen small islands;
the largest not being more than three miles in length, and about
one and a half in breadth.<br>
<br>
The island at which we stopped was of considerable height. The
trees were of stunted growth; the grass was luxuriant, and the
water in abundance. On the (granite) pinnacle of the island, we
observed an immense collection of stones, resembling a
<i>cairn;</i> and as we imagined it served the same purpose, we
did not fail to increase the heap by a liberal contribution.<br>
<br>
High water occurs at about 2h 30' after the Moon's culmination,
and the tide rises from eight to ten feet.<br>
<br>
The latitude, as already observed, is 10&deg; 13' 27" south, and
the longitude, (by lunar observations, and by chronometer
corrected from the Eastern Fields,) is 141&deg; 56' 36",
east.<br>
<br>
Neither Captain Flinders nor Captain King went so far north, and
therefore did not notice these islands; which, in compliment to
the Honourable Captain Duncan, R.N., we named Duncan's
Isles.]</p>

<p><small>The</small> weather was serene and apparently settled;
and the eastern breeze blew steadily, by the influence of which
we were propelled neither slowly nor unpleasantly over the
undulating bosom of the emerald sea. We were also cheered by the
indications of continued moderate weather, confirmed by the
placid aspect of departing day.</p>
<p>The night came on, and every thing around us still wore a
favourable appearance, and our spirits were buoyed up by the
pleasing hope, that the issue of our enterprise might be
prosperous.</p>
<p>The long-boat, in the centre, led the way; the skiff being
stationed on one quarter, and the jolly-boat on the other. As
before mentioned, we had a few candles; but they were reserved
for use, in the event of the weather being hazy; and, while the
sky was clear, we directed our course by the stars.</p>
<p>During the night, we proceeded at the rate of four miles an
hour; nothing occurred to cause us any alarm, nor, from the
appearance of early mom, did we apprehend any sudden change. The
weather continued fine throughout the day, the sea smooth, the
wind fair, and the boats kept close company. At noon, having
ascertained our latitude and longitude, we kept on our course for
New Year's Isle.</p>
<p>Now came "Saturday night at sea", a night commonly supposed to
be dedicated by the sons of the waves to reminiscences of
"sweethearts and wives", and to "the flowing bowl". This,
however, is more in song than in reality;&mdash;at least, it has,
in a great measure, like many other old customs, passed away;
and, with all due regard to Dibdin's memory, it may be fairly
doubted, whether the time be very fit to drink and sing "while
the foaming billows roll." Be that as it may, we could only
celebrate it in sober silence.</p>
<p>Since our departure from the islands, we had seen little to
enliven our lonely way. A few "boobies" occasionally made their
appearance; two of which, having this evening lighted on the
boat, were caught, and soon snapped up, without much ceremony of
cooking. We passed a great number of sea-snakes, whose movements,
especially during the night, were exceedingly beautiful.</p>
<br>
<p class="indent"><small>"Within the shadow of the
<i>boat</i>,<br>
    I watched their rich attire;<br>
Blue, glossy green, and velvet black.<br>
They coiled, they swam, and every track<br>
    Was a flash of golden fire."</small></p>
<br>
<p>No untoward event occurred during the night, and we kept
advancing, guided by the stars, which did not withdraw their
shining until the sun shed his beams on the slumbering sea. The
day advanced, the weather continued propitious, and we indulged a
hope that fickle fortune was inclined to make some amends for her
late conduct towards us.</p>
<p>From the scanty state of our wardrobe, we were unable to make
that alteration in dress, usual (especially among well behaved
sea-faring men) on Sunday; yet each individual contrived to make
some difference in his appearance, from a feeling of respect to
the day.</p>
<p>In the forenoon, conformably to usual custom, we joined in the
performance of Divine service; but in the present instance we did
not adhere to the prescribed forms, having judged it preferable
to select such Psalms, and other portions of Scripture, as were
more immediately applicable to persons in our situation; and it
may readily be believed that our devotion was fervent and
sincere. Indeed, our lives depended on so frail a tenure, that
there was no difficulty in abstracting our thoughts from all
worldly affairs; and the contemplation of the sea and sky tended
to inspire us with a faint conception of that Almighty Power by
whose fiat they sprang into existence!&mdash;It was by no means
an uninteresting scene, to behold three small boats, in the wide
ocean, crowded with human beings, apparently at the dubious mercy
of the winds and waves, offering up their prayers and
supplications to H<small>IM</small>, "who is the confidence of
the ends of all the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the
sea."</p>
<p>At noon, the latitude, by observation, was 10&deg; 41' south,
and longitude 137&deg; 56' east. We continued our course, still
favoured by pleasant weather, and the billow-smoothing breeze. On
Monday afternoon we were visited by an immense shoal of dolphins,
which accompanied us for some time, whose swift and varied
evolutions tended to relieve the dull and dreary scene, although
their appearance boded no good to us. The mighty leviathans were
also this evening disporting in their boundless domain; and we
beheld their unwieldy and terrific gambols with fear and
trembling, but fortunately we escaped unscathed.</p>
<p>The weather, which had hitherto been so propitious, now began
to assume a threatening aspect; as the night advanced, the wind
became baffling, slight showers of rain fell, and the darkness
was so intense, that we lost sight of the other boats, although
they were at no great distance from us. We hoisted a light,
hoping that they might thereby be enabled to keep company, and
held on our way.</p>
<p>We passed the night in some anxiety, and when day-light
appeared, none of the boats were in sight; our consternation at
this accident was extreme, being aware that no person in the
absent boats knew the position of Melville Island. At first we
proceeded on, thinking, that, as they sailed far better than we,
they might be before us; but having soon changed our opinion, we
shortened sail, and in about an hour, after many a strained eye
had been wistfully scrutinizing every part of the horizon, we had
the satisfaction of perceiving both boats bearing E.S.E.</p>
<p>On joining, we learned that they had not seen our light, and
that they had also for some time lost sight of each other; we
rejoiced at our meeting, and resumed our course, as near as the
wind, which had now shifted to the north-west, would permit. At
noon our latitude was 11&deg; 2' south, and longitude 134&deg;
12' east; which we communicated to the other boats, and apprized
them also of the latitude and longitude of the British settlement
at Melville Island, lest accident, or unavoidable occurrence,
might again separate us. The wind continued light and variable,
chiefly from the north-west;&mdash;an uncommon quarter to blow
from at this place and season of the year. During the night the
boats were in close company; and a sharp look out was kept to
prevent our being taken unawares by any sudden change of the
weather; as, from appearances, we anticipated that some
alteration would soon take place.</p>
<p>On Thursday, at noon, we found ourselves considerably to the
southward, the latitude being 11&deg; 14'. Not being acquainted
with the coast, and having nothing but a general chart to direct
us, we intended to pass to the northward of New-Year's Isle. As
the afternoon advanced, the weather assumed a more gloomy aspect,
and we perceived, with deep anxiety, the indications of an
approaching storm.</p>
<p>About seven, <small>P.M.</small>, not being able to lie higher
than south-west, and to avoid a dense and dark-looking cloud,
which was brooding over the deep in that direction, we wore, and
stood on the other tack;&mdash;hardly was this manoeuvre
effected, when the wind, in a sudden squall, shifted, and blew
furiously from the southward; the rain poured down in torrents,
accompanied with loud and long-continued peals of thunder; and
vivid streams of lightning flashed fearfully on our eyes. We were
now enabled to shape our course, and, the wind being
unaccompanied with a heavy sea, we advanced with much rapidity in
the midst of this elemental war.</p>
<p>About midnight we discovered land, concluded to be New Year's
Isle. We passed to the northward, and proceeded on in
company;&mdash;the lightning showing us to each other. In about
an hour, we perceived another island, which puzzled us not a
little; we kept away, to give it a good berth, and then resumed
our course, thinking all safe, when a friendly flash of lightning
showed us a rock right a-head, to which we were fast approaching;
and on which, in a few minutes, the boats must inevitably have
been dashed to pieces!&mdash;we had just time and room to avoid
this unexpected and unknown danger.* Admonished by this narrow
escape, we thought it prudent to stand to the northward, under
easy sail, until daylight; when we directed our course for
Buckle's Isle, which we expected to reach about noon.</p>
<p class="foot">[* By Captain King's chart, I perceive the first
land we made was Maccleuer's, and the second, Oxley's Isle. The
rock from which we had such a hair-breadth escape, is also laid
down, about two miles to the north of the latter Island.]</p>
<p>The sea was now becoming formidable, the wind augmenting in
strength, and all appearances indicated that our dangers were
increasing. We continued advancing together till noon, when we
fortunately obtained the sun's meridian altitude, which shewed
our latitude to be 10&deg; 59'; but, much to our astonishment and
vexation, there was no appearance of land.** Just as we finished
the observation, the skiff suddenly hove-to, and the chief mate
hailed us to do the same: but this was impossible, as we were
compelled to run before the wind, even if it had been to certain
destruction.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Buckle's Isle, as we afterwards learned, does
not exist.]</p>
<p>The jolly-boat came on with us, and those on board her
expressed an earnest desire to be received into the long boat. We
did not at all relish this proposal; and they were rather harshly
reproached with having lost courage, and admonished to be of good
cheer. We shortened sail, and fired several muskets for the skiff
to join us; but we had the mortification, in a short time, to
lose sight of her, by which circumstance we were greatly
depressed.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="pic-02" id="pic-02"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>JOLLY-BOAT'S CREW SOLICITING TO BE RECEIVED INTO THE LONG
BOAT.</small></p>
<br>
<p>The wind and sea were gradually acquiring strength; and those
in the jolly-boat renewed their pressing solicitations to be
taken on board the long-boat. We were greatly annoyed at this,
more particularly as they seemed to be "dodging" about us, in
order to seize an opportunity of jumping on board, regardless of
consequences; but we succeeded in getting to windward of them,
when they waved their hands, and bade us farewell!</p>
<p>We then hailed and informed them that, should the weather
become worse, we would consider whether we could receive them on
board before dark. At this time, the sun broke through the
clouds, and we seized the opportunity of ascertaining the
apparent time. Some thought they saw land bearing S.S.W., but I
believe it was only a heavy low cloud. As the night drew on, the
weather grew more tempestuous.</p>
<p>We now deliberated whether we ought, or ought not, under
existing circumstances, to take the jolly-boat's crew on board.
She was a fine boat, and had behaved, and was behaving,
remarkably well; while the long-boat was already too deeply
laden, and required the constant labour of two hands to keep her
free. However, we unanimously agreed, although with much
increased hazard of our own lives, to admit them on boards as
they had evidently yielded to despair, and consequently could not
exert their energies in case of emergency.</p>
<p>We made known to them our determination, but previously to
receiving them, (trusting to the rain,) we thought it prudent to
pump off a cask of fresh water, which, with several other things,
we threw overboard, to lighten the boat. They were then cautioned
to come on board, carefully, one by one, in case of doing
irreparable injury to our frail bulwark: this they agreed to do,
but, unmindful of their promise, as soon as it was in their
power, they all jumped in together. This imprudent action might
have been attended with fatal consequences, if several of us, who
had little dependence on their promises, had not taken the
precaution to place ourselves on the larboard side, and thereby
balanced the boat. Few were the greetings between us and the
new-comers, who were placed in different parts of the boat to
preserve her trim.</p>
<p>The jolly-boat, thus abandoned, skimmed away, like a sea-fowl,
over the waves; while the long boat, over-pressed by her
additional burden, could scarcely swim. To add to our uneasiness,
night was coming on, the wind increasing to a heavy gale,
accompanied by a deluge of rain, and the sea ran mountains
high.</p>
<p>It now behoved us to be most attentive to the steerage; as the
neglect of a moment might prove our ruin. We kept W. by S. for
Melville Island, but our hopes of reaching it were very slender.
By great vigilance, we managed to elude the encroachments of the
waves, till about nine, <small>P.M.</small>, when a heavy sea,
whose death-denoting sound still lingers in my ears, rolled over
the larboard quarter, and filled the boat! For a moment we were
paralysed, believing that we were going down, without the most
distant hope of any one of us being saved. Finding, however, that
the boat still floated, we took heart, baled away, and threw
every article of no essential importance overboard.</p>
<p>The sea had upset the compass, extinguished the light, and
rendered it impossible for us to obtain another; yet we managed,
(although the task was difficult) to keep the boat right before
the wind. Just as we had got her baled out, she was again filled
by another wave. We now determined to hazard the dangerous
experiment of taking in the mainsail; this being effected, and
the reefed-jib set, we could do no more than quietly submit to
the will of H<small>IM</small>, who "rides in the whirlwind, and
directs the storm."</p>
<p>It was fortunate that we acted thus, as not even a spray broke
over us afterwards. Often did we expect to be overwhelmed by the
following sea, whose dismaying roar seemed a summons to eternity;
but our gallant boat behaved beyond all expectation
well,&mdash;bearing us in safety over the curling summits of the
highest waves.</p>
<p>The strength of the wind, and the turbulence of the sea,
diminished considerably on the approach of mom, which, although
ushered in with clouds and rain, was, to our eyes, exceedingly
grateful. Uncertainty of the fate of our companions in the skiff
excited feelings of intense and painful anxiety; but knowing the
skiff to be a fine boat, not overladen, and well managed, we
entertained the hope that she had successfully resisted the
united force of winds and waves, and that our fellow-sufferers
would, in a very short time, reach Melville Island. Consoled, in
some degree, by this idea, we hoisted our reefed-mainsail, and
pursued our dreary way.</p>
<p>As daylight became perfect, low land was descried bearing to
the southward; and apprehensions were entertained that we should
not be able to gain our intended port, as it was more than
probable that the boat had been driven to the westward; and at
noon, we ascertained that such fears were well
grounded;&mdash;being three miles to the northward, and several
to the westward, of Cape Van Dieman. To think of beating back
(although the distance was so short,) would have been absurd: we,
therefore, without hesitation, directed our course to Timor.</p>
<p>It required great caution, and unremitted care, to keep our
trembling boat right before the wind, which, although its fury
was much abated, yet blew with sufficient vehemence, and
accompanied with a turbulent swell. The heavy showers of rain
that fell at short intervals, and the foamy spray, combined to
keep us constantly and thoroughly wet. Next day, at noon, we
found that we had advanced upwards of one hundred and fifty miles
during the last twenty-four hours. The wind still blew in our
favour, but stronger than we wished, and in sudden squalls,
which, intermingled with thunder, lightning, and rain, kept us
constantly on the alert, as we pursued our precarious path across
the Timor Sea.</p>
<p>On the first of June, about six, <small>P.M.</small>, we
discovered land. To say that this event caused universal joy,
would convey but a faint idea of the feelings that pervaded every
bosom. Next morning, at daylight, we found ourselves within a few
miles of the projecting land to the eastward of "the bay of the
Pearl bank", when, directing our course to the westward, and
keeping within a short distance of the shore, we made all the
sail we could, hoping to reach Coupang before dark; but this
expectation, notwithstanding the wind blew fresh and fair, was
not realized: and, as the day declined, fearing that we might be
driven past the Island during the night, we thought it prudent to
take shelter, until the morning, in a small bay which appeared
suitable to that purpose; and to which we accordingly steered,
until the sight and sound of broken water compelled us to alter
our course.</p>
<p>We then proceeded towards a sandy beach, where we purposed to
run the boat on shore: on approaching it, however, the surf
appeared so very heavy, that had we persisted in our intention,
the boat would have been probably dashed to pieces; or, had we
succeeded in getting her safely on shore, to launch her again
would have been impossible. Influenced by these considerations,
we gave up the idea; and being now in two fathoms water, we
lowered the sails, and hove out a grappling, which, assisted by
the rebounding swells kept the boat from drifting. By this time,
the day had closed, and the aspect of the sky led us to expect
moderate weather.</p>
<p>This part of the coast, from the numerous fires observed on
the hills near us, appeared to be well inhabited; but not knowing
how we might have been treated, had we been in the power of the
fierce and lawless natives, we were rather pleased than
otherwise, that such a powerful barrier intervened.</p>
<p>We now joined cheerfully, and partook of our frugal fare; and
then, thanks being offered to our Almighty Preserver, we disposed
ourselves in the best way we could to rest, and, undisturbed by
fears of foundering, enjoyed a night's refreshing repose.</p>
<p>At daylight, we got under weigh; but we had not proceeded far
when the rain fell in torrents, accompanied by a very dense fog,
which prevented our seeing to any distance. About nine,
<small>A.M.</small>, we had approached very near to the land,
which was considered the south-west point of Timor; off which we
perceived a reef extending about a mile. By hauling up, we were
able to clear the breakers; but, being just on the verge of them,
we got into a very turbulent and confused sea, which, in a short
time, we cleared. As the land now trended to the northward, we
altered our course accordingly; and the weather having cleared
up, we saw Pulo Rottee, and the neighbouring islands; by which we
felt assured that we were in the straits of Semao.</p>
<p>Strong gusts of wind came occasionally off the Timor shore;
one of which, from want of due precaution on our part, carried
away the mast. The yard being soon converted into a mast, mid an
oar into a yard, the sail was fitted thereto, and we resumed our
course, which was now, we hoped, drawing near a fortunate
termination.</p>
<p>Shortly after this, we perceived a brig, which appeared to be
working out of the bay. Various were the conjectures as to what
she was, and whither bound; some thinking her an American, some
an Arab, and others a Dutchman. After a little discussion, we
edged away for her, exhibiting our ensign as conspicuously as we
could. Some time elapsed before she took any notice of us, and we
began to think that it was not her intention to do so; but, at
length, she stood towards us and displayed her colours, which,
with much emotion, we discovered to be those of our native
land.</p>
<p>As we drew near the vessel, we observed the crew gazing on us
with looks of sympathy; and, among the number, to my
astonishment, I perceived my friend Mr. Radford, whom I imagined
to be at Melville Island On recognizing me, which he did with
difficulty, he evinced the kindly feeling of his heart, by
shedding tears, on beholding the change which hardships and
misfortunes had made in my appearance. Captain Young and myself
went on board, and were kindly received, while refreshments were
liberally distributed among those in the boats. The vessel proved
to be the colonial brig Amity, from Coupang, where Mr. Radford
had been purchasing provisions for the British settlement at
Raffles Bay, whither she was now bound.</p>
<p>We were informed that Melville Island had been abandoned. This
intelligence caused us much uneasiness, on account of our
fellow-sufferers in the skiff, who, we hoped, had reached that
settlement; and although we were relieved, in some degree, by
hearing that plenty of vegetables had been left; yet, from the
treacherous and hostile character of the natives, we were under
great apprehensions as to the safety of our companions. We also
learned, that there were several vessels at Coupang (American,
Arab, and Dutch), chiefly employed on the coast; and that, ere
long, we might have an opportunity of proceeding either to
Sourabaya or to Batavia.</p>
<p>I had little inclination, however, to revisit Java, where I
had nearly fallen a victim to the fatal disease that occasionally
rages there; moreover, I had had an opportunity, subsequent to a
former shipwreck, of visiting, not only several interesting
islands in the Indian Archipelago, but also the greater part of
British India, both within and beyond the Ganges; I therefore
determined to embrace the opportunity, now afforded me, of
visiting the north coast of New Holland.</p>
<p>I came the more readily to this determination, from knowing
that I should be very comfortably situated with Mr. Radford, who
was in charge of the Commissariat at Port Raffles; yet I could
not avoid being a good deal affected on parting with my
shipwrecked companions,&mdash;participation in misfortune tending
strongly to cement social union. Several of them, including the
carpenter, expressed a wish to accompany me, and the master of
the brig consented to take them. Captain Young being anxious to
reach England, thought it prudent, on his part, to proceed by way
of Batavia.</p>
<p>We thus separated, after an affectionate farewell,&mdash;those
in the long boat for Coupang, and we in the brig for Raffles Bay.
The master of the brig having previously relieved our anxiety by
promising to keep along the south coast of Timor, in search of
the skiff; and then, if unsuccessful, to touch at Melville
Island, where some information respecting her might be
obtained.</p>
<p>It is impossible for any person, not having undergone the same
confinement, to imagine the pleasure derived from being able to
stretch the limbs, even on a brig's deck;&mdash;I had not,
however, enjoyed that pleasure long, when my ears were annoyed by
the grating, clanking sound of the pumps, and I learned that the
vessel made a great deal of water. This news was far from
agreeable, and I almost wished myself again in the boat.</p>
<p>We continued working out until the evening, when, not being
able to stem the current, and bad weather coming on, the master
thought it advisable to bear up for Coupang, in order to get the
vessel repaired;&mdash;our carpenter, a man skilful in his
business, haying engaged to put her in a state more fit for sea
than she was in at present. I was much pleased by this
arrangement, which gave me an opportunity of seeing Coupang, and
also of meeting those from whom I was so suddenly separated, I
went early to bed, and slept soundly until morning, when, rising
renovated, I found the brig at anchor in Coupang Bay.</p>
<p>The return of the vessel excited much surprise, and it was
supposed that some accident must have happened. I think I may
say, however, that the event was regarded with satisfaction by my
friend Captain Young, who, I learned, had been invited and
entertained on board the "Merkus", (a brig, under Dutch colours,)
commanded by a countryman of our own. We went together, to pay
our respects to the Resident, who received us politely, and
assured us of his protection and assistance.</p>
<p>We then went to visit the Secretary to Government, with whom
Captain Young entered into satisfactory arrangements for
supplying the sailors with lodging and provisions, until they
could be forwarded to Batavia or elsewhere. We found a group
assembled at the Secretary's office, consisting of the masters of
the ships in port, and several of the mercantile inhabitants, who
seemed anxious to hear the particulars of our shipwreck. The
master of an American ship, in return, favoured us with a very
interesting account of his having navigated these seas for many
years, without having met with any accident.</p>
<p>In taking a stroll through the streets, we met several of the
sailors, quite forgetful of their providential escape, cruizing
about, and <i>kicking up a dust</i> with the inhabitants, who had
supplied them too liberally with ardent spirits, and who now
suffered their aggressions with considerate forbearance.</p>
<p>In the evening, a small sail, apparently a boat, was perceived
making her appearance from the Straits. A boat from the "Amity"
was immediately manned, and, hoping she might be the skiff, we
pulled quickly towards her, but, on drawing near, we were
mortified by discovering that it was a small Malay proa.</p>
<p>Early next morning, being on the look-out, we discerned a
small sail just emerging from the Straits. A boat from the
"Amity", and another from the "Merkus", (emulous of each other,)
pulled heartily towards her, and, ere long, we had the heartfelt
satisfaction of recognizing our companions in the skiff; and Mr.
Underwood, the chief mate, gave us the following account of their
proceedings since the time of our separation.</p>
<p>On the day we parted company,* about noon, a sea broke into
the boat, and the man who was steering, having, on a former
occasion, been swamped, became apprehensive of experiencing a
similar accident, and immediately, and without orders, put the
helm down. When they saw us proceeding on, they bore up and
endeavoured to follow; but, in a short time, as the sea ran high,
they considered it more safe to lie-to, which they accordingly
did.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Vide page 41.]</p>
<p>As the weather became worse, they had recourse to the
following expedient: the masts, being unrigged and unstepped,
were, together with the yard and oars, securely lashed, and
thrown overboard, the end of the rope, by which they were bound,
being made fast to the bow of the boat, which then rode pretty
easy; the spars serving, in some degree, as a
breakwater;&mdash;and thus they remained upwards of thirty
hours.</p>
<p>On the weather moderating, they made sail, and stood towards
the land, which was soon discovered. Observing several fires to
the south-eastward, they endeavoured to work up for that part of
the land, supposing the settlement to be there; but after beating
about nearly a day, without having gained any ground, they gave
up the attempt as fruitless, and after much discussion, the
majority agreed to direct their course to Timor.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** They fortunately had a chart of this island
in "Milburn's Oriental Commerce", which book had been,
accidentally, thrown into their boat, when we left the "Governor
Ready".]</p>
<p>Thus did we all (twenty-seven in the long-boat, and twelve in
the skiff) reach this friendly port, after having sailed upwards
of 1300 miles over a dangerous, and occasionally very turbulent
sea; and although there was no want of skill and presence of mind
on the part of those who directed, nor of willing alacrity on the
part of those who obeyed; yet it must be evident, that all human
means, under such circumstances, would be exerted in vain, unless
under the protection of a superintending Providence, to whose
merciful interference our preservation can alone be
attributed.</p>
<p>On taking a retrospective view of the occurrences attending
our journey, it was evident that every thing had happened for the
best; although, at the time, we formed a very different
conclusion. Had we reached Booby Island, we could not have had
such a good opportunity of repairing our boat, neither could we
have ascertained the position of several hitherto unsurveyed
islands. Had we not encountered a gale of wind, we might have
reached Melville Island, where we could only have met with
disappointment and disasters. The rain, also, that fell so
unremittingly and in such abundance, although it tended to render
us very uncomfortable; yet, on the whole, was in our favour, not
only by diminishing thirst, but also by keeping the atmosphere
comparatively cool, and preventing us from being scorched by the
burning rays of a tropical sun.</p>
<p>Throughout the passage, rigid discipline and strict
impartiality being observed, no insubordination nor the slightest
disturbance occurred among the crew; whose behaviour was highly
creditable to themselves, and well worthy of imitation by others,
who may hereafter be placed in the same trying situation. We
lived very sparingly, from motives of prudential caution, yet we
did not experience any very great privations. Besides having a
little biscuit daily, we had either a bit of cheese, or a morsel
of salt beef; and although we had to eat the latter raw, it did
not prove unpalatable, when we reflected on the horrible means,
to which others, similarly circumstanced, had been compelled to
resort,&mdash;the dread of which being constantly in our minds,
made us exceedingly frugal; so that, on our arrival, we had
sufficient provisions to support life for nearly a month
longer.</p>
<p>We had, as before mentioned, a little brandy in the boat,
which, being issued daily after dinner, in the proportion of one
third of a wine-glassful to each individual, lasted till the day
before we made the land, and, small as the quantity was, it added
comfort to our scanty fare. From our having pumped off a cask of
water to lighten the boat, before receiving the jolly-boat's crew
on board, it behoved us to be, and we were, exceedingly cautious
in the expenditure of this important article; but the rain
generally affording a supply, we suffered little or no
inconvenience from thirst.</p>
<p>Perhaps it may not be out of place now to mention, that the
ship was wrecked on a very small patch of coral, detached, and
lying about two cables' length to the south-west of a reef whose
position is accurately laid down, by Captain Flinders, in south
latitude 10&deg; 2', and east longitude 143&deg; 21'.</p>
<p>It is a very common, but highly reprehensible practice, when a
ship is lost on a reef or sand-bank, to account for the accident
by affirming, either that the danger has not been previously
known; or that its position is inaccurately laid down on the
chart; or that the ship has been drifted out of her proper course
by unknown currents. That vessels are frequently lost, through
one or other of these canines, there can be no doubt, yet it is
no less true, that many others owe their destruction to ignorance
or inadvertence.</p>
<p>Although our disaster might, in like manner, be easily
ascribed either to currents, erroneous charts, or recent-formed
coral reefs, yet it must be confessed, that we were not entirely
free from blame.1st. We gave a reef on the larboard hand too wide
a berth, and, in consequence, the fair channel being very narrow,
we (assisted partly by the tide,) approached too near the reef on
the starboard, off which the ship was lost.&mdash;2dly, We ought
to have passed to the northward of the reef, where there was not
only much more sea-room; but where, by our being between the sun
and the reef, its limits and detached patches, (from the
beautiful green appearance, contrasted, when viewed in such an
aspect, with the dark blue of the deep water,) would have been
much more easily and accurately discerned. This error was
committed by our wish to avoid going round about, so that we
might reach Half-way Island before the sun got too far
a-head.&mdash;3dly, In such an intricate navigation, we ought not
to have carried such a press of sail; for, if the ship had not
been going with such velocity, it must be evident, she would not
have struck with so much force, and, consequently, there might
have been some chance of getting her again afloat, before she
became irreparably injured.</p>
<p>These errors being thus stated as a warning to others; I
cannot conclude without mentioning, that no person could have
paid more devoted and unremitted attention, in every respect, to
his duty than Captain Young, who is a good practical seaman, and
a very superior navigator. He was ably assisted by his chief
mate, Mr. Underwood, a young man possessing every requisite to
form that inestimable character&mdash;a thorough-bred
seaman;&mdash;But any encomium of mine may be deemed
superfluous&mdash;a more correct estimate of both their
characters being easily formed from the fact, that the strictest
discipline, order, and regularity, were preserved after the
shipwreck; and, in consequence of this, and of their other
well-directed exertions, assisted by Divine Providence, all hands
reached a distant friendly port, in safety.</p>

<p class="negindent"><small>Coupang&mdash;Sale of the
Boats&mdash;Description of the Town&mdash;Its
Trade&mdash;Husbandry&mdash;Government&mdash;and
Inhabitants&mdash;Departure from Coupang&mdash;"Amity" nearly
wrecked&mdash;Arrival at Raffles' Bay.</small></p>
<p><small>I HAVE</small> already mentioned that we were kindly
received by the Resident of Coupang. He was in very low spirits,
not only on account of having lately been bereft of his wife; but
also from a more recent affliction he had experienced, by the
death of his pastor, friend, and counsellor, the Rev. Mr. Le
Brun, who had unexpectedly fallen a victim to an insidious fever
a few days before our arrival.</p>
<p>Under the influence of these depressing events, the Resident
lived quite retired: he expressed to me his regret that I had not
arrived a little earlier, as he thought the assistance of a
British surgeon might have saved the life of his much-valued
friend, who had not received the advantage of medical attendance
during his illness, in consequence of the only surgeon, in whom
dependence could be placed, having been, a short time previously,
carried off by an attack of a similar disease.</p>
<p>The day after our arrival, we received a polite invitation to
dine with Mr. Teilmann, Secretary to Government, who had invited
all the Europeans, of any note in port, to meet us. At the time
appointed (3 <small>P.M.</small>). Captain Young, Messrs.
Radford, Underwood, Owen, and myself, repaired to his hospitable
abode, where we found a considerable number already assembled,
forming a large circle in the cool and spacious verandah, each
individual occupying an easy arm-chair, smoking cigars, and
puffing care away.</p>
<p>After our introduction, which was performed with much
formality, we were invited to take a cigar, and a glass of wine
or spirits before dinner. This appears to be a common custom
here, as the attendants, without being called, waited on us, one
with cigars, another with a lighted stick, and a third with wine,
spirits, and water. The company being all arrived, dinner was
announced, and after a little ceremony, we were all comfortably
seated at table, on which was tastefully spread an abundance of
choice and well-cooked viands, whose savoury odour might tempt
the most fastidious appetite;&mdash;it is therefore not to be
wondered at, that our eyes wandered over the various dishes with
more than epicurean delight.</p>
<p>Fish of several kinds,&mdash;soups, including the birds'-nest
and trepang, together with many other equally rich items, having
heed partaken of,&mdash;our worthy host called out with a loud
voice "<i>Bo ma kanna!</i> which, being interpreted, signifies
"Bring dinner." To us, who had lately fared so scantily, it
seemed strange, and somewhat absurd, that such rich and delicious
food, of which several had so liberally partaken, should not even
be considered as a part of dinner. We were no less astonished to
find, in this semi-barbarous place, people who had skill to
prepare, and taste to enjoy, dainties well deserving the
admiration of the most refined apician connoisseurs.</p>
<p>The attendants, also, who were numerous, gave an additional
zest to the entertainment, by performing their office with
promptitude and good will. In such circumstances, it was
difficult to act in conformity with the precept of Celsus;* but
as the one part of it had been broken from necessity, it was
deemed fair and just on our part to break the other from choice,
and <i>carpere diem</i> while it was in our power.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Neque vero ex multa fame nimia satietas, neque
ex nimia satietate fames idonea est.]</p>
<p>After dinner, the bottle circulated freely, and several who
had until now been very silent, began to show symptoms of the
<i>Cacoethes loquendi</i>; but as the conversation was carried on
either in Dutch or Malayese, I could not derive much advantage
from it. Having consumed no inconsiderable quantity of
well-cooled claret, we retired from table, and enjoyed our coffee
under the verandah; after which, some took leave,&mdash;others
remained to smoke cigars, and drink brandy and water.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the interests of the sailors, who were
comfortably lodged in Fort Concordia, were not forgotten; but it
was not long before they began to make complaints of the roguery
of the person who had contracted to supply them with provisions.
On inquiry, there did not appear any just cause of complaint, and
the contractor (a native dealer) was so annoyed by their
groundless accusation, that he declined having anything more to
do with them; when the Serjeant of the Fort, an Amboynese,
undertook the office of purveyor.</p>
<p>There being no notary public, nor, indeed, anything in the
shape of a lawyer in Coupang, Captain Young could not get a
protest drawn up according to legal form; but, deeming it prudent
to make some public statement, relative to the circumstances
attending the loss of the vessel, as early as possible, he did so
in a clear and concise manner, and the Secretary lent his
assistance to give it some formality.</p>
<p>The two boats were then advertised to be sold by auction, for
the benefit of the underwriters. The long-boat, if it had been in
good condition, and sound, would have sold well, as it was of a
convenient size and form to trade along the coast. Before the
sale, however, a Chinese carpenter was sent to inspect the boats,
who soon discovered the defective worm-eaten state of the long
boat; and, in consequence, at the sale it only brought 175
dollars, while the skiff, being in a sound state, sold for 180.
The first was purchased by the Collector of Customs, a son of the
Resident; and the other by Mr. Bechade, a French merchant, whose
polite and friendly attention to us will be long and gratefully
remembered.</p>
<p>From the shortness of my visit, and the peculiar circumstances
attending it, I could not obtain much information respecting the
Island of Timor, which, from its geographical position and
natural productions, is deserving of far greater notice than it
has yet received. The Dutch, however, have, it would appear,
viewed it as of small consideration, in comparison with their
other oriental insular possessions. Yet, they have, with
characteristic prudence, taken care that its various capabilities
should be kept in the shade, lest their trading rivals might be
tempted to break the tenth commandment.</p>
<p>Although, from the above-mentioned causes, I have little
information to communicate, yet the following cursory
observations relative to Coupang may not be deemed altogether
unimportant.</p>
<p>This town, the principal settlement of the Dutch, is situated
on the south side of a capacious bay, near the western extremity
of the island; where vessels of any burden may anchor in safety,
excepting when the N.W. monsoon blows; in which season they
usually find convenient shelter under the lee of a small adjacent
island named Pulo Semao.</p>
<p>The view of the town from the anchorage does not impress the
stranger with a very favourable idea of the industry or
enterprise of its inhabitants;&mdash;on the left bank of a small
rapid river is a <i>madreporic</i> rock of some elevation,
whereon is built Fort Concordia, which commands the town, and may
thereby keep it, and the various aboriginal tribes, in awe; but
being completely commanded by more elevated ground to the
westward, it could not be of much avail in repelling the hostile
attacks of a disciplined force. To the eastward of the fort, on
which the Dutch flag waves, a few red roofs of houses may be
perceived here and there, sprinkled among the trees. To the
westward of the fort, at a little distance, may be observed a
considerable number of fishermen's huts, in a little cove, shaded
by the cocoa and palmyra palms. On approaching nearer to the
town, its aspect improves a little. The residence of Mr.
Bechade,&mdash;a Chinese temple, and some other pretty fair
buildings, tend to embellish the Marina, where a commodious inn,
now nearly completed, will be of much advantage to strangers.</p>
<p>The principal street, parallel with the right bank of the
river, contains some good houses, a few of which are in repair,
but by far the greater part are more or less dilapidated. Here
are situated the Church, and the habitations of the Resident, the
Secretary, and others connected with Government. Rows of trees on
each side of the street, being without their usual attendants,
canals, afford an agreeable shade, without being detrimental to
health.</p>
<p>The other streets, if they deserve the name, are narrow and
crooked, and the houses formed chiefly of bamboo. The town is
well supplied with water from the river, which is fresh at a very
little distance from its mouth. The principal part of the town is
on the right bank, but there is a considerable number of houses
on the left bank also, and a communication exists by means of a
bamboo bridge.</p>
<p>The river rises from the mountains to the southward, at no
great distance from the bay. Its banks for several miles are
cultivated; and, viewed from the rising ground behind the town,
they have a very picturesque appearance. The steep shelving
sides, in which rice is chiefly grown, are formed into terraces,
and well irrigated. At the bottom of the glen (as it may be
called), the cocoa, the palmyra, the banana, the bread-fruit, the
orange, and the lemon tree, flourish luxuriantly, and diffuse an
air of happiness and plenty around the peaceful-looking
habitations, which are strewed pretty thickly on both sides of
the river.</p>
<p>It may appear almost incredible, that notwithstanding the
length of time (upwards of 200 years) this place has been
colonised, there is not a carriage road of any description,
excepting one along the sea-shore, about a mile in length,
leading to the villas of the Resident and Secretary. There are
several bridle paths, which, not having received the smallest
assistance from art, are very indifferent, and to those
unaccustomed to them, exceeding irksome and fatiguing. During my
short excursions into the country, I could not help reflecting,
how different it would have appeared, had it been a tithe of the
time under British sway.</p>
<p>As Coupang has lately been made a free port, it is probable
that its prosperity may increase; and as it is convenient for
vessels employed in the whale fishery to refit and refresh, I
have no doubt they will now make it a frequent rendezvous. A
considerable trade is carried on, chiefly in sandal-wood and
bees'-wax, which meet a ready sale in the Chinese market. Horses,
which are of a small breed, but exceedingly hardy, form an
article of export, principally to the Isle of France. They are
most readily procured by vessels going along the coast, in
exchange for powder and muskets;&mdash;the importation of these
articles being prohibited at Coupang.</p>
<p>The British settlements on the north coast of New Holland are
supplied from this place with buffaloes, sheep, and occasionally
with other articles; and, as it was imagined that a commercial
intercourse might be established, Mr. Bechade, who had entered
into a contract to supply the settlement with fresh provisions,
purchased a vessel to trade between Timor and Melville
Island.</p>
<p>The chief mode of agriculture practised here is highly
curious. To prepare a field for the reception of rice, maize, or
wheat, a herd of buffaloes are turned into it, and chased to and
fro, until the ground is imagined to be sufficiently wrought; and
notwithstanding this slovenly system of husbandry, the fertile
earth yields an abundant return.</p>
<p>Coupang, and the subordinate settlements along the coast, with
the adjacent islands of Rottee and Semao, are governed by a
Resident, (under the control of the Governor of Java,) who is
also commander of the troops, judge, jury, magistrate, and, in
short, possesses power almost absolute. The present Resident,
however, who has held the appointment for a long time, exercises
his authority with so much mildness, that the inhabitants have
but little reason to complain.</p>
<p>Fort Concordia is garrisoned by a handful of Amboynese troops,
who have a very soldier-like appearance; their athletic forms,
and healthy aspects, indicating them to be far better adapted for
service in this climate, than the miserable squalid-looking
troops from Batavia, who are sent here in charge of prisoners.**
Such troops, however, are not allowed to remain long here, being,
it is supposed from motives of jealousy, sent back to Batavia by
the first opportunity.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The Dutch make this a place of banishment
from their other settlements.]</p>
<p>The Resident has a salary of about 600<i>l</i>. a year; it is
hinted, however, that his salary forms only a small part of his
income, but I have no doubt that this is only mercantile scandal.
He informed me, that he was about to undertake an expedition into
the interior, in search of gold mines, with Mr. Macleod, a Dutch
mineralogist sent from Batavia for that purpose; and, in order to
repel any hostile attacks of the fierce mountaineers, he would
take a <i>cort&eacute;ge</i> of at least 1000 men. I was
astonished at his being able to maintain so large a number; but,
on inquiry, I learned that such an armament could be put in
motion without any expense to the Dutch Government, each Rajah,
under the protection of its flag, being required to furnish his
quota, not only of men, but also of provisions, and other
necessaries for their maintenance during the expedition.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Coupang are a very heterogeneous mass,
being composed,&mdash;1st, of a mixture of Dutch and Malay blood,
to which class belong the Resident, the Secretary, and other
Public Functionaries; 2dly, the unmixed Malay: 3dly, Chinese, of
which there are a considerable number; 4thly, a mixture of the
Chinese and Malay:&mdash;there are few Europeans, Mr. Bechade, a
merchant, Mr. Macleod, a naturalist, and the ex-Secretary of
Banda, a pure Dutchman (sent here without his own consent), being
the only white inhabitants.</p>
<p>I could obtain no certain account of the total number,
although I sought information from the channel where it was most
likely to be found,&mdash;any thing resembling a census never
having been thought of. The population, however, must be very
considerable, particularly of the Malays; as on walking through
the streets, great numbers of sturdy fellows are met with, who
are either loitering about, perfectly idle, or triflingly
employed in selling fruit and confectionary. Their wants are few,
and easily satisfied. They appear to be as much enamoured with
the delightful <i>far niente</i>, as the Neapolitan Lazzaroni, to
whom, in this and in other points of character, they bear a
strong resemblance.</p>
<p>The Chinese, who are chiefly mechanics, work industriously on
their arrival; they soon, however, quit their original trade,
preferring to wander about the country as chapmen, bartering
various articles for honey and bees'-wax. The town is
consequently very badly supplied with artificers, so much so,
that Mr. Bechade was obliged to send a coffee-mill to Raffles'
Bay, to be repaired.</p>
<p>Excepting the Chinese, all the inhabitants are, or profess to
be. Christians, having been converted through the instrumentality
of the Missionaries, who are sent here, and to the neighbouring
islands, by the Dutch Government, from which they receive a very
slender salary; the Missionaries, in general, are much respected
by the natives, and as they commonly contrive to get married to
Rajahs' daughters, they are enabled to live very
comfortably.&mdash;Such intermarriages with the natives may be
considered more advantageous, both in a religious and political
point of view, than providing a missionary, on the eve of his
departure from his native land, with a helpmate whom he may never
have previously seen, and who may not be at all calculated to
add, either to his happiness or usefulness.</p>
<p>The Amity, which was laden with buffaloes, sheep, and maize,
for the use of the settlement at Raffles' Bay, was repaired, and
in a fit state for sea on Saturday, the 7th of June; and on
Sunday morning, at day-light, we sailed from Coupang. Captain
Young, his officers, and several of the crew, were to leave on
the following Tuesday, in the Dutch brig Merkus, belonging to Mr.
Bechade, for Batavia, and the remainder were to proceed in a
Chinese vessel to the same place. As I before stated, the
carpenter (who had, since his arrival in port, been offered great
inducements to remain), and five of the crew, accompanied me in
the Amity. It was not without regret that I again parted from my
other shipwrecked companions, particularly Captain Young, whom I
much esteemed.</p>
<p>Having passed the Straits of Semao, the sea being smooth, and
the breeze favourable for beating, we endeavoured to work to the
eastward, but owing to the strength of the current, we could not
make any progress; it was therefore deemed advisable to run
through the Straits of Rottee, and then to stretch across to the
New Holland shore; as it was probable, that a quicker passage
might be made by pursuing this course, than by beating up
directly in the teeth of the monsoon. In the evening, we
accordingly bore up, shortened sail, so as to pass leisurely and
cautiously through the Straits, lest we might be suddenly brought
up by some unknown danger. Next morning, we hauled up, passed
between Rottee and Pulo Dama, and stretched to the southward.</p>
<p>As Captain King's charts were not on board, and as several
islets, reefs, and shoals, whose positions are far from being
accurately ascertained, are said to exist in the Timor Sea, more
particularly in that part of it which we intended to traverse,
arrangements were made to insure a strict look out, especially
during the night.</p>
<p>On the 15th, at daylight, several islands were observed
bearing S.E.; we stood on the starboard tack, and at noon the
western island bore about S., distant five or six leagues; our
latitude was 13&deg; 50' south, and longitude 124&deg; 59' 15"
east.</p>
<p>In the evening, we again stood to the S.E., and at daylight,
on the 16th, the eastern island of the group bore S. by E.,
distant about three miles, when we stood on the other tack. These
islands not being laid down by Flinders, considerable care was
taken to ascertain their true position, although we had no doubt
that they had been noticed by Captain King.</p>
<p>At noon our latitude was 13&deg; 43' S., and longitude
125&deg; 31' E. About half past one, <small>P.M.</small>, the cry
of "Breakers right a-head" made us all on the alert; the vessel
was kept away, and the mate sent to the mast-head to observe the
extent and direction of the reef, while others were employed in
ascertaining its situation. At 1<sup><small>h</small></sup> 45',
<small>P.M.</small>, when the southern extremity of the reef was
visible, bearing exactly east, distant about two miles, the
altitude of the sun was taken, and again at a convenient interval
(the brig having little way), for the purpose of ascertaining the
latitude by a double altitude.* The south part of the reef was
thus ascertained to be in latitude 13&deg; 35' S.; and by the
sun's meridian altitude, brought forward by account, 13&deg; 35';
and by the mean of the meridian altitudes of several stars
observed between 6<sup><small>h</small></sup> 40' and 9
<small>P.M.</small>, and carried back by account 13&deg; 35' 25".
And from the care thus bestowed, I think the latitude may be
considered pretty correct. The longitude by chronometer,
corrected by lunar observation, is 125&deg; 35' 45". The reef
trended to the N.E. as far as the eye could distinctly
survey.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* I observe in a quote in Galbraith's very
excellent and compendious work on Navigation, lately published,
that he has been informed by a celebrated navigator, that double
altitudes are not so advantageous as is generally supposed. This
may be the case; but they are not altogether to be despised. I
have frequently seen them (Ivory's Problem being used) prove
exceedingly useful.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Some time after my arrival at Raffles' Bay, I
had an opportunity of inspecting Captain King's Charts. He does
not take notice either of the reef or of the
islands;&mdash;supposing that they have not hitherto been met
with, the reef may be named the Amity or Owen's Reef; and the
islands (in compliment to Captain Barker, of the 39th Regiment,
Commandant of the settlement at Raffles' Bay) Barker's
Isles.]</p>
<p>We kept on to the northward, having no desire to meet other
reefs, especially during the night; but after a day or two, our
alarm having subsided, and making little progress, we again stood
to the southward, and by keeping near the north coast, had
favourable slants. We saw no more islands nor reefs, but passed
over several extensive patches of discoloured water, which,
however, were not of less depth than fifteen fathoms.</p>
<p>On the 24th of June, about midnight, having only four fathoms
water, it was judged prudent to heave-to until daybreak, when we
found ourselves close to Bathurst Isle. We then continued our
course as near as the wind would permit, not hesitating to keep
pretty close to the shore. We continued working up along Melville
Island, and the Cobourg Peninsula, without seeing Buckle's Isle,
for which I was keeping a look out, much more at my ease, than
when expecting to see it in the boat.</p>
<p>About two, <small>P.M.</small>, of the 31st of June, we
arrived at Raffles' Bay, and shortly afterwards I went on shore,
in company with my friend Mr. Radford, by whom I was introduced
to the Commandant, who received me with politeness and
sympathising cordiality, offering me an apartment in the fort,
and a seat at his table.</p>
<p>I did not, however, take advantage of his proffered
hospitality, having previously arranged to live with my friend
Mr. Radford, until an opportunity offered of returning to Sydney,
which, there was reason to hope, would soon occur, as I
recollected that the Mermaid schooner was nearly ready to sail
from Sydney when we left, to relieve the Amity which had been
nearly two years on this station.</p>
<p>I met here several soldiers, and prisoners of the Crown, who
had come to New South Wales under my care, whose condolence,
which I believed sincere, afforded me much gratification.</p>

<p><small>The</small> settlement was under the command of Captain
Barker, of the 39th Regiment; Mr. Radford was in charge of the
Commissariat department, assisted by Mr. Hickey; Dr. Davis,
Assistant-Surgeon of the 39th Regiment, had the medical charge; a
party of Royal Marines, a detachment of the 39th, and several of
the 67th Regiment, constituted the defensive strength of the
settlement. Several prisoners (here named volunteers) performed
the necessary labour; there were also a Malay, named Da' Atea,
and a little native girl. I was rather astonished to
find,&mdash;after the dismal accounts I had heard,&mdash;all the
Europeans, men, women, and children, in good health.</p>
<p>On the first day of my arrival, several of the natives were in
the camp, who appeared to be on friendly terms with the settlers.
On July 2d, Joseph Collins, and on July 3d, William Erasmus, two
men belonging to the Amity, died from fever caught at Coupang.
Joseph Collins was the last of seven men left at Coupang from a
whaler (all the others, I was informed, having died there). They
were buried with much decency, every one in the settlement
attending. Miago, and several other natives, were also present,
who paid minute attention to the solemn ceremony.</p>
<p>This native, Miago, who has an intelligent and shrewd,
although savage-looking countenance, is well made, and in
throwing the spear, which he does with great dexterity, his
attitude is very graceful. As he is a great mimic, and makes
himself quite at home, he has become rather a favourite in the
camp. I presented him with some trifling article, which he seemed
to prize, and gave him to understand that I wished to have some
tortoiseshell in return for it, which he promised to bring me;
and in a few days he fulfilled his agreement.</p>
<p>Dr. Davis was greatly astonished at this instance of honesty,
as he had predicted that Miago, being paid beforehand, would
never think of giving the required equivalent. Being, however,
now convinced that a savage might have some notions of honesty,
he gave Miago a canoe on the same terms, which were punctually
fulfilled; although the Doctor considered that he had not got a
sufficient quantity of tortoise-shell, which deficiency might
have arisen from Miago not having yet acquired correct notions of
barter.</p>
<p>Captain Barker and myself, from our ideas coinciding on
several subjects, particularly relative to the Aborigines, soon
became on very friendly terms. I learned from him that, shortly
after his arrival, the natives, who, since an unfortunate affair
at Bowen's Straits, had kept out of sight, again made their
appearance in the vicinity of the settlement, when he used every
endeavour to induce them to come into the camp, but without
success, until a little child, belonging to one of the soldiers,
went and led in the Chief, Wellington, by the hand. He was
evidently under great alarm, looking back frequently, and
addressing himself to Waterloo, his <i>fidus Achates</i>, who
kept in his rear.</p>
<p>But, at length gathering confidence, and relying on the faith
of the strangers, he ventured in, when he was treated with much
kindness, and departed apparently highly pleased. On discovering
the little native girl, both Wellington and Waterloo evinced
great emotion, particularly the latter, who was, on that account,
believed to be her father. Seeing her so well taken care of
increased their confidence; she was then named Mary Waterloo
Raffles,&mdash;but her native name was Riveral.</p>
<p>After this occurrence, the intercourse with the natives was
renewed, and, as Captain Barker used every precaution to prevent
their receiving injury or molestation from any individual in the
camp, it continued unbroken, although a circumstance occurred,
which was likely to cause some disturbance:&mdash;a Malay had
come to the settlement, who pretended that he had been
shipwrecked; he said that he had been speared by the natives, and
that one of his companions was in the bush. On hearing this
statement, Captain Barker detained one of the Aborigines,
(several happening to be in the camp at the time,) and sent out
the others in search of the supposed lost Malay. They returned
unsuccessful, and seemed to remonstrate on the impropriety of
keeping their companion a prisoner, protesting, at the same time,
that they knew nothing of the man.</p>
<p>After some time had elapsed. Captain Barker began to suspect
that Da' Atea (the Malay) was prevaricating; and so it turned
out, as he proved to be a deserter from a Malay proa, in Trepang
Bay, from which place he (having heard of a white settlement) had
walked to Raffles' Bay, and encountered, on his journey, many
dangers and privations. This detention of one of the Aborigines,
however, did not cause any misunderstanding, as they seemed
clearly to comprehend the import of it, by their anxiety to
explain their ignorance of any stranger being in the bush.</p>
<p>Not long after this event. Captain Barker, to show his
confidence, took a walk with them, without being armed, and
unaccompanied by any person from the fort. The natives appeared
highly pleased by such an unequivocal mark of confidence. He went
with them nearly to Bowen's Straits, when, as far as he could
understand, they begged him to return, which he accordingly
did.</p>
<p>The natives now visited the camp, neither molested nor
molesting; and everything went on smoothly, until one night, a
native, named Luga, having, by swimming under water, escaped
notice, had nearly succeeded in carrying off a canoe, when he was
discovered and challenged by the sentry. Being so close that he
could not escape, he surrendered, and was taken to the
guard-house, where he was confined during the night.</p>
<p>Next morning, he was taken to the beach, and the canoe was
pointed out to him, and also to Monanoo, another native, who was
present; and after explaining to them, as clearly as possible,
the cause of punishment, Luga was tied up and received a
<i>quantum</i> of corporal chastisement. During the infliction,
he was constantly calling out "Iacama", (the native name of
Waterloo,) who, it appeared, had encouraged him to attempt the
theft, and who had escaped.</p>
<p>The Commandant, to mark the difference resulting from good and
bad conduct, behaved very kindly to Monanoo, and made him a
present of a hatchet. It was well that he acted so judiciously
and prudently; for in the afternoon, a great number of natives
were discovered advancing towards the settlement. They were soon
joined by the two natives, (Luga, after having received his
punishment, being set at liberty,) and it appeared that Monanoo
had explained matters quite satisfactorily, as they all came into
the camp in a fearless and friendly manner.</p>
<p>They were in number fifty, mostly athletic and active-looking
men, headed by a fine venerable-looking old man, named
Wooloogary, the Chief of Croker's Island, to whom they seemed to
pay great attention. After remaining at the settlement about an
hour, and partaking of some rice, Captain Barker made Wooloogary
a present of a tomahawk, and all the natives departed, very
quietly and peaceably, before the sun went down.</p>
<p>I think it is very probable, that this considerable assemblage
of the natives was formed to give some weight to the request of
having their countryman liberated. Perhaps it was their intention
to act with hostility, if the request were not acceded to;
however this may be, Luga having been set free, they made it
appear that their visit was intended in good part, and so it was
received.</p>
<p>Captain Barker had a great deal of difficulty to contend with,
in his method of treating the natives; as no other individual in
the settlement could be brought to consider these poor beings in
any other light than wild beasts. Those who had to work in the
bush, conscious, perhaps, of their own conduct, were occasionally
under great alarm, not being entrusted with fire-arms. Several
times they were frightened, but never received any
injury,&mdash;the natives wishing to be on friendly terms.</p>
<p>It happened, one day, that Miago came suddenly on a sawyer,
named Carr, who was employed in his vocation at some distance
from the settlement. Although thunderstruck by the unexpected
visit, Carr retained sufficient self-possession to request the
native to assist him to move a large log. While Miago was
stooping down to comply with his request, Carr took to his heels,
and bellowed loudly for assistance, Miago running after him. The
settlement was soon under arms; and, with the Commandant at their
head, hastened to rescue the poor man from the clutches of these
savages, who, it was now evident, were not to be trusted, as it
was affirmed by a person who had fled, that they had carried Carr
into the bush.</p>
<p>The party had not proceeded far, when they met a man running
with all speed, who informed them that the natives had not taken
Carr, but had run off with all his tools. Shortly afterwards,
they met Carr running with all his force, nearly exhausted with
fatigue and fear, and Miago close at his heels, who seemed quite
unconscious that he was the cause of all the alarm; and it
appeared quite satisfactory to the Commandant that there was no
intention, on his part, to be otherwise than civil and obliging;
that on his way to the settlement, which he frequently visited,
he fell in with Carr, and was, by his own request, assisting him,
when he so cowardly took flight.</p>
<p>This circumstance, trifling as it may appear, might have been
attended with disagreeable consequences, if the Commandant had
not proceeded personally. It may easily be imagined, that a party
of men armed, on seeing a white man running, and apparently
pursued by a black, would have fired without hesitation; more
particularly, as they had hitherto been accustomed to do so
without much ceremony.</p>
<p>A short time before I arrived, Captain Barker had paid a visit
to the natives, placing himself under Wellington's care, who
seemed not a little flattered by such a mark of distinction. Dr.
Davis accompanied him a little way into the woods, and then
endeavoured to persuade him to return, representing his
expedition to be dangerous and foolhardy. He, however, was not
deterred from his undertaking, but gave the Doctor permission to
go back, if he felt at all uncomfortable: the Doctor took him at
his word, and returned to the settlement, where every one
lamented the rashness of the Commandant in trusting himself with
such a set of savages; more especially as they knew that the said
savages had ample cause for retaliation.</p>
<p>These unfavourable surmises were not realized, as Captain
Barker was treated with the greatest attention and kindness.
Wellington would neither accept of any present himself, nor would
he permit any of his followers to do so, although, when in the
camp, he was constantly begging for something. In the evening,
they prepared a mess of fish, which they had speared, and were
highly delighted to perceive Captain Barker partake of it. In
travelling, whenever they came to a stream, or marsh, one of the
natives, named Marambal, insisted on carrying him over.</p>
<p>During his expedition, he met Luga and his family; but
although many miles from assistance, even this native received
him kindly, neither appearing to remember, nor exhibiting any
wish to resent, the punishment he had received;&mdash;being
conscious, no doubt, that he had deserved it.</p>
<p>He did not see any of their women, who seem, even here, to
have a will of their own; for although Wellington used his
endeavours to introduce them, they would not listen to him, but
kept constantly out of sight. In the evening, the Captain retired
to rest, as the natives did, on the sand. Next day, he returned
to the settlement in safety, to the great joy of all our people,
who, thenceforth, began to consider the natives in a more
favourable light than they had hitherto done.</p>
<p>Captain Barker informed me he had lent Wellington a canoe for
a fortnight, and that no person in the settlement believed it
would ever be returned. Dr. Davis, who still viewed the natives
(and particularly Wellington), with a prejudiced eye, was quite
confident that he would never again visit the settlement; or if
he did so, that he would make some excuse for not returning the
canoe.</p>
<p>I learned also, that a considerable number of Malay proas,
chiefly from Macassar, had visited the settlement last season,
and that while they remained, their crews had conducted
themselves with much propriety. They were highly gratified by
their reception, and much pleased with the prospect of being able
to carry on their operations without fear of molestation from the
natives, with whom they are always at variance, and whom they
represented as very bad characters,&mdash;stating that they were
in the habit of stealing their canoes, and spearing their men,
whenever an opportunity offered.</p>
<p>They spoke well of the natives of the coast, on the gulf of
Carpentaria, four of whom were accompanying them to Macassar.</p>
<p>While they lay in Raffles' Bay, two canoes were stolen from
them, and they came ashore, in great wrath, to attack the
natives, some of whom were in the settlement. This warfare, in a
neutral port. Captain Barker would not permit; at the same time,
he informed them, that if they could point out the depredators,
he would give his assistance, not only to punish the guilty, but
also to get the canoes returned; but that he would not allow the
natives to be attacked indiscriminately. After a little
demurring, they acquiesced in the justice of this decision, and
returned on board.</p>
<p>As the four men from the Gulf of Carpentaria were, at the same
time, missing, it was hinted that they had taken the canoes to
convey them home. This, however, the Malays would not believe,
but affirmed that the Raffles' Bay natives had also taken them
away.</p>
<p>The Malays described an island in the Gulf of Carpentaria as
abounding with sandal wood: this, if true, would render it of
some importance, and Captain Barker intended to proceed thither
with them next season, to ascertain the truth of the report. They
inquired if they would be allowed to settle at Raffles' Bay; and
were much pleased when informed that they would not only have
such permission, but that their interests would be protected.</p>
<p>A considerable number of proas commonly proceed in company,
under the command of the most experienced chief, whom they
recognize as a leader only while it suits their convenience, as
they disperse whenever they consider it more conducive to their
advantage. When they are in the fleet, however, they all follow
the motions of their leader. The proas are all armed, although
indifferently: each proa is generally, but not always, provided
with a compass. Even the most experienced of the Malays have no
notion of a chart, nor are they expert sailors: indeed, there is
not much occasion for this exercise of skill, as they only come
and go with a fair wind.</p>
<p>On leaving Macassar, they steer so as to make the coast of New
Holland about Port Essington, which is their place of general
resort; they then pass to the eastward, by Raffles' Bay, through
Bowen's Straits, and proceed, according to their own report, as
far east as Cape York.</p>
<p>When the season draws near an end, they direct their course
west, retracing their eastern route, and assemble in Port
Essington, prior to their departure for Macassar.</p>
<p>They left the settlement, highly pleased with their
reception,&mdash;promising to revisit it, in great numbers next
year.</p>
<p>As the brig Amity was lying in port, awaiting to be relieved
by the Mermaid, Captain Barker determined to proceed in her, to
take a minute survey of Port Essington, as he thought it probable
that he might receive orders to remove the settlement thither;
and I very willingly accepted the invitation to accompany
him.</p>
<p>On the 22d of June, when we were all ready for departure, a
vessel was discovered in the offing, standing into the Bay, but
it was evident she was not the daily-expected Mermaid. Dr. Davis
being indisposed. Captain Barker requested me to board her. She
proved to be the brig Resource, from Sydney to the Isle of
France. Her object in touching here was to land the crew of the
Mermaid, which vessel had been wrecked on the 13th of June, from
what I could learn, on the outer barrier reef. The crew took to
the whale-boat, and, after three days, were picked up by the
schooner Admiral Gifford, and shortly afterwards sent on board
the Swiftsure; which ship was, on July 5th, wrecked off Cape
Sidmouth,* and her crew were also on board the Resource.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The Swiftsure was said to be the vessel in
which Buonaparte escaped from Elba.]</p>
<p>The master of the late Mermaid accompanied me on shore, with
the despatches, which he had saved; and which, he informed me,
contained orders for the abandonment of the settlement. This
intelligence caused universal regret. I do not suppose that six
volunteers would have been found, if left to their choice, to
proceed to Sydney.</p>
<p>However, although the orders created vexation and surprise;
yet, on reflection, it was evident that something of the kind
might have been expected, from the unfavourable reports that had
been, in the first instance, transmitted to head-quarters
respecting the settlement.</p>
<p>We also learned, that H.M.S. Satellite might be daily
expected, on her way to India; and the colonial brig Governor
Phillips, to assist in conveying the settlers to Sydney.</p>
<p>The ship Reliance was also about to leave Sydney, to proceed,
through Torres' Straits, for India. As there were several
newly-married people on board, it was hoped she would get safely
through,&mdash;as a reef, or a crowded boat, would not be a very
agreeable place to spend the honey-moon.</p>
<p>On the 24th of July, about midnight, my friend Mr. Radford
died. He had been complaining ever since his arrival from
Coupang, and had been confined to bed for the last fortnight,
during which, he was sedulously attended by Dr. Davis. But the
force of the disease,&mdash;acute hepatitis, supervening on the
chronic form,&mdash;baffled his best-directed exertions.</p>
<p>It may easily be imagined that I felt, very severely, the loss
of an individual whose friendship I had experienced under
circumstances not easily to be forgotten. On Sunday, after divine
service, he was consigned to the grave, with military honours,
and with great respect; every man, woman, and child, in the
settlement attending, as he was much beloved.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the 29th of July, early in the morning. Dr.
Davis and myself descried a sail in the offing; and, in a short
time, two more were discovered. One of them appeared to be a
man-of-war; the others we supposed to be the Government vessels.
Governor Phillips and Lucy Anne; and we hastened back to the
settlement to communicate the intelligence.</p>
<p>The man-of-war proved to be H.M.S. Satellite; but the merchant
vessels were, the ship Reliance, and the brig Thompson, which had
profited by the opportunity of proceeding through Torres'
Straits, by the inner passage, under the guidance of Captain
Laws, and had put in here for a supply of water.</p>

H.M.S. Satellite and the Ship Reliance&mdash;Arrival of the
Schooner Admiral Gifford&mdash;Affray at Hammond's
Island&mdash;Disgraceful conduct of the crews of small
Vessels&mdash;Anecdotes concerning the Natives.</small></p>
<p><small>EXPECTING</small> to meet several old shipmates in the
Satellite, I was not long in paying her a visit; and the cordial
reception I met with, recalled to my memory the days of "Auld
lang syne." I dined on board with Captain Laws, from whom I
received much information respecting the inner route through
Torres' Straits. He told me he had seen the wreck of the
Swiftsure, within less than half a mile of the shore at Cape
Sidmouth;&mdash;that he had sent on board, but nothing was
observed excepting a few empty casks floating in the hold.</p>
<p>In the evening of the 30th, Wellington, the native chief, with
a number of his tribe, visited the settlement, and brought back
the canoe. I was much pleased at this occurrence, as it
established the position that Captain Barker and myself firmly
maintained, viz. that the natives were not such rogues as they
were reported to be; and that they were "more sinned against than
sinning." This was the first time I had seen Wellington, and I
was agreeably deceived in his appearance.</p>
<p>Next morning, Captain Barker made him a present of the canoe;
but it was some time before he could believe that it was a gift:
it is needless to say how highly gratified he was by such an
acquisition.</p>
<p>At this time, there happened to be a misunderstanding between
him and Miago, on account of jealousy, for Miago had lately
become rather a favourite in the camp; and, consequently,
received many a piece of old iron hoop, and even two or three
nails, and other presents: these favours were far from being
relished by Wellington, who occasionally got sulky; as he wished
himself to be the only source through which any of his subjects
should receive favours: but the present of the canoe had put him
into such good humour, that he resolved to gratify us with a
dance.</p>
<p>In the evening, a large fire was kindled just before the fort,
and the natives danced round it with great vigour and spirit, to
the music, produced by one of their party from a long hollow
tube. Dr. Davis joined them, but although he might "keep time"
correctly enough for a civilized ball-room, yet he fell short in
that necessary part, at least to a savage ear; so they, in very
polite terms, requested that he would not fatigue himself, but
stand and look at them. Lieutenant Weston, of the East India
Company's service, took a very spirited and correct sketch of
this singular performance. Wellington did not dance himself,
being busily employed in persuading us that Miago was only a
<i>Mandrowillie</i>, and therefore not entitled to so much
attention.</p>
<p>After the dance, they were all regaled with a mess of rice, of
which they are very fond. Supper being finished, they requested
permission to remain all night in the settlement, which was
granted; and Captain Laws having invited Wellington, and several
others, including Miago, to visit the Satellite next forenoon,
they retired very quietly and contentedly to rest.</p>
<p>On the morning, long before the appointed time, Wellington and
his party, consisting of Olobo and Miago, pulled on board the
Satellite in his lately-acquired canoe. Captain Laws, Captain
Barker, and myself, went on board about eleven o'clock. We found
our sable friends highly delighted with their entertainment,
having been shaved and clothed. They seemed to pay particular
attention to the manoeuvres of the marines.</p>
<p>Captain Laws having ordered two guns to be loaded, the natives
begged that they might not be fired. Olobo jumped on the poop,
and placed himself behind a sailor, of whom he kept fast hold,
scarcely having courage to peep over his shoulders. Wellington
was invited to fire the first gun, but no persuasion could
prevail on him to do so; and placing his hands over his ears, he
went to the opposite side of the deck. Miago was then led to the
gun; when Wellington, fearing that Miago might acquire more
credit, jumped to the gun, and fired it. Miago fired the second
gun without hesitation, and when he and Wellington saw the shot
strike the water near the shore, their astonishment was extreme.
After a few seconds of mute surprise, Miago cut a variety of
capers on the quarter-deck, to the infinite amusement of the
ship's company. As for Olobo, he appeared to be glad that the
affair was over.</p>

<br>
<small>DANCE OF THE ABORIGINES OF RAFFLES BAY.</small><br></p>
<p>While we were at <i>tiffin</i> in the cabin, Wellington came
down, and requested that no present might be given to any person
but himself. This prohibition was directed in a special manner
against Miago. Then turning round to the Captain's steward, he
inquired his name, and what he was. On learning that he was a
<i>Mandrowillie</i>, he immediately took him by the back of the
neck, and endeavoured to thrust him out of the cabin. Being
requested to desist, he did so, but with some reluctance; he
requested permission to sit down with us, and was gratified by
receiving the desired indulgence. He then resumed the old
grievance about Miago, with great vehemence of jargon and
gesture. In the midst of his oration, he happened to turn round,
and to his astonishment beheld Miago standing at the cabin door,
listening with great tranquillity and composure to his harangue;
when, with dexterity that could not have been exceeded by a
civilised man of the world, if caught in such an awkward
predicament, he immediately changed the subject, pretending to be
talking of something else, and at the same time very graciously
and condescendingly presented some fish-hooks to Miago, who
received them with sulky indifference.</p>
<p>The sight of dinner, which was now ready for them, restored
good humour. They were served, on the quarter-deck, with a large
dish of rice, sugar, yams, and pumpkins, of which they partook
very heartily. They did not appear to relish the pumpkins, but
the yams and rice they enjoyed greatly. They requested some of
the sailors, who had been civil to them, to partake; and seemed
to think it strange that they could not come abaft the gangway to
do so.</p>
<p>As they could not consume the half of what was prepared for
them, Wellington received permission to take the remainder on
shore; when he made an equal distribution of it amongst a number
of his tribe, who had been on the beach all day, waiting his
return. He also entertained them with an account of his
adventures on board, with which they appeared to be no less
gratified, than with the habiliments and other presents which
their chieftain had received.</p>
<p>Next day, the same party were taken on board the ship
Reliance, after having received particular instructions not to
throw aside their dress (which they were apt to do) in the
presence of the ladies. As the ship had no guns, and was
otherwise unlike the Satellite, Wellington called her a
<i>Mandrowillie</i> ship, and paid little attention to any thing
on board. He had, however, sufficient good taste to admire the
ladies, and was particularly struck with the beautifully
luxuriant ringlets of one of them.</p>
<p>On Sunday, August the 2d, Wellington and a few natives; and
shortly afterwards, Miago and others from a different part of the
coast, paid another visit to the settlement.</p>
<p>Having obtained the loan of King's Australia, I embraced the
opportunity of comparing the Raffles' Bay dialect with those he
has taken notice of:&mdash;they did not bear the smallest
resemblance. Wellington being placed in a chair alongside of me,
and being in a good humour, he went on some time pretty well, now
and then digressing about Miago being a <i>Mandrowillie</i>, and
stating his annoyance at our marked attentions to him.</p>
<p>While he was thus remonstrating, Miago made his appearance,
and of course was kindly received; but this was so discordant
with the feelings of Wellington, that he became sulky, and would
not answer any more questions. I then addressed myself to
Waterloo, the chief that ran away with the axe (after having seen
and tried its use), who gladly began to communicate the desired
information. On this, Wellington thought it prudent to be
communicative, and gave me the native names for "head", "eyes",
"nose", "mouth", &amp;c., with such volubility, that I could not
understand him. It was with difficulty I could keep his attention
to the subject; he said nothing more about Miago, he being
present, but ever and anon talked about a <i>mambrual</i>.</p>
<p>After having explained to him that I would give him a present,
if he would have a little patience, he was satisfied, but kept a
bright look out, lest any of his tribe should in the interim
receive any thing; at last I succeeded in removing his fears in
that respect, but another unlooked-for result followed. Not
possessing the same interest in communicating, as I did in
receiving information, his attention being kept so long on an
object altogether uninteresting to him, he soon fell fast
asleep.</p>
<p>On Monday, Captain Laws gave a <i>d&eacute;jeun&eacute;
&agrave; la fourchette</i> on board the Satellite; Captain
Barker, Dr. Davis, Lieutenants Weston and Gray, and three ladies,
were present, which rendered it quite a gay scene in this remote
comer of the globe. The crew of the Satellite pitched their tents
on shore; and Captain Laws embraced this opportunity of painting
the ship inside and out. The officers also took up their abode on
shore, which made the settlement assume a very active
appearance.</p>
<p>We learned, from despatches, that the Governor Phillips, was,
after her return from Norfolk Island, to proceed immediately for
Raffles' Bay, to assist in the removal of the settlement, and as
Captain Laws imagined that she had arrived in Sydney the same
morning that he left it, she ought to have made her appearance
ere this; and apprehensions were now entertained that she had met
with some accident, and various circumstances rendered this not
at all improbable.</p>
<p>To obviate the inconveniences that would arise to the
settlement, in the event of such an accident, it was judged
expedient by Captain Laws and Captain Barker to charter (under
certain conditions) the brig Thompson, to carry cattle, stores,
and a proportion of the people, as far as Swan River, (where the
cattle and stores were to be left,) and the people to be carried
on, in the brig Amity, to King George's Sound.</p>
<p>Tuesday, August the 4th, Wellington, accompanied by a native,
paid another visit to the camp: to-day his first word was
"<i>Mambrual</i>", and the second "<i>Miago mandrowillie</i>." He
was gratified by my saying "<i>&#275;&#275;, &#275;&#275;</i>."
and was then presented with a shirt, when he begged that Miago
should not receive any thing. After having adjusted his
shirt-collar by the aid of a looking-glass, and having admired
himself sufficiently, he accompanied Captain Laws and myself into
the bush, and, being in a good humour, he gave us the native
names of such natural objects as presented themselves.</p>
<p>We visited Mr. Radford's grave, and Wellington appeared to be
a good deal affected, when he understood who was buried there,
repeatedly uttering in a plaintive tone, "<i>Mut&#275;
commissar&#275;&#275; and&#275;</i>." He was very particular in
his inquiries as to the names and rank of others buried near the
same spot; and on returning, we overheard him explaining these
particulars to the other natives.</p>
<p>Passing the hut, inhabited by the soldier and his wife under
whose charge the native girl was, Wellington went to take some
notice of her, but she endeavoured to hide herself, and could not
be induced to come near him, until forced to do so;&mdash;being
somewhat piqued at this, he informed us she was a
<i>Mandrowillie</i>.</p>
<p>It is a singular circumstance, that this girl has such an
aversion to her countrymen, that if, while she happens to be
playing with any of the other children, she observes the natives
coming towards the settlement, she instantly endeavours to get
out of their view.</p>
<p>Orders were received from Sydney to leave this girl behind;
but, as it was imagined that such orders had been issued under
the impression that her removal would be against the wishes of
the natives. Captain Barker determined to take her to Sydney;
more particularly as her father, and all the other natives were
extremely solicitous that she should not be left behind, and
expressed great satisfaction when they understood that she was to
be taken with us. It was some time, however, before the natives
could comprehend that we were all going away. They appeared to be
very sorry, and many of them gave us to understand that they
would willingly accompany us.</p>
<p>On Friday, August the 7th, the brig Thompson was chartered
conditionally to assist in conveying us to Swan River; and
arrangements were now made for the division of the people: Dr.
Davis was to proceed in the Amity, and I was to accompany the
Commandant in the Thompson.</p>
<p>This chartering of the Thompson was judicious; she was to
remain ten days; and if, during that interval, the Governor
Phillips did not arrive, she was then definitively engaged to
proceed to Swan River for the sum of 400<i>l</i>. Should,
however, the Governor Phillips arrive, she was to receive
50<i>l</i>. as demurrage, and the charter to be void. This
afternoon the Reliance sailed for India.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the 9th, several of the natives visited the
settlement; the timorous Olobo received a <i>mambrual</i>, which
he stowed carefully away in his basket, lest, as I imagine,
Wellington might perceive and wish to have it.</p>
<p>In the afternoon a vessel hove in sight, which it was hoped
might be the Governor Phillips; but she proved to be the schooner
Admiral Gifford, from Sydney, employed in the Trepang fishery, in
which she had been pretty successful.</p>
<p>In the evening, as several of the midshipmen were amusing
themselves by firing at the marines' weather-cock, one of the
balls whistled over the heads of Olobo and his company, who were
enjoying themselves with a large dish of rice; and who (being
previously rather alarmed by the foolish and reprehensible
conduct of the gun-room steward, in snapping an unloaded pistol
at Olobo's breast) started off like lightning into the bush. This
event caused us much annoyance.</p>
<p>From the master of the Admiral Gifford, I learned the
following particulars, which, if true, reflect little credit on
all concerned.&mdash;While off Hammond's Island, the natives made
a signal for them to come on shore; a boat was accordingly sent,
and soon returned with two natives, who came without hesitation.
They were well treated on board, having received food and various
presents. The boat was again sent on shore with them, and the
crew were directed to procure tortoiseshell.</p>
<p>Shortly after they landed, the natives endeavoured to entice
the sailors into the bush; but, not succeeding, they attacked and
knocked two of them down, and were advancing towards the third,
when he fired his musquet, and killed one of those who had been
on board. Another of the sailors, while lying on the ground,
being attacked by two natives, who were struggling to obtain
possession of his pistol, discharged it, and killed them both.
After this, the other natives fled, and the boat returned; when
the master, hearing the account of the transaction from the mate
and sailors, went immediately on shore, but could discover no
trace of the natives, dead or alive.</p>
<p>I have not the smallest doubt, that this shameful transaction
is widely different from the <i>exparte</i> relation given of it;
and it is much to be regretted, that cognizance of such
occurrences is not taken before a competent court of justice. The
outrageous behaviour of the greatest part of those lawless
vagabonds, employed, or employing themselves, along the coast, in
procuring seal-skins, towards the Aborigines, is quite notorious:
many well authenticated instances of their horrible cruelty have
come to my knowledge. In the present instance, it is evident,
that the story is exceedingly confused; and this occurrence may
be the cause of the destruction of the next Europeans who land on
the island;&mdash;as these savages, cherishing revenge, will
probably inflict it on the first Europeans that fall within their
power.</p>
<p>It is the duty of every one (and it ought to be enforced) to
behave with great caution and mildness in his intercourse with
the natives; but more particularly with those, whose abode lies
in the track of ships, the crews of which, by a misfortune common
in these seas, may be (as they frequently have been) entirely at
the mercy of these ignorant, but not naturally evil-disposed
savages.</p>
<p>I was also informed by the master, who had touched at
Hammond's Island on a former occasion, that the natives are
cannibals, as they felt the fleshy part of his arms with apparent
delight: this he observed to be a general action among cannibals.
But, perhaps, the Malays, who accuse the Aborigines of Raffles'
Bay of being cannibals, because they eat snakes, may be equally
right in their surmises.</p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon, 11th of August, we were gratified by a
visit from three natives; Jacama, alias Waterloo, Marambal, alias
Alligator, (so named on account of his immense mouth, and long
white teeth,) and Mimaloo, alias One-eye. Orders were given to
prevent the discharge of fire-arms in the camp, as it was deemed
indiscreet to run any risk of breaking the good understanding
that at present existed, by any incautious act; the natives not
being able to discern the difference between firing for fun, and
firing with intent to destroy.</p>
<p>They came to the cottage just as we had finished dinner; and
knowing they were welcome, walked in, and made themselves at
home. They discovered great emotion at the sight of a turtle,
which I had received from the master of the Admiral Gifford.
Waterloo requested very clamorously to have it; but he was kept
within bounds by the other two.</p>
<p>Mimaloo then showed us their method of killing the turtle, and
pointed out, with signs of ecstatic delight, the parts of it that
they chiefly prized; and&mdash;whatever difference may exist
between them in other respects&mdash;we found, that in the
knowledge of turtle, a savage is as skilful as an alderman.</p>
<p>They were much amused by a musical snuff-box: Mimaloo, in
particular, paid great attention to it; at first, the "stops"
seemed to confound him; but he soon started up, and, with
Marambal, danced a waltz in a manner that astonished us.</p>
<p>Captain Laws then sent for the ship's fiddler; who turned to,
<i>con amore</i>, with a favourite half-deck tune. After having
heard it once. Dr. Davis, Marambal, and Mimaloo, began the dance:
the Doctor was soon obliged to give in; but the two natives
continued, with undiminished spirit, and intuitive skill, to
perform feats worthy of, and receiving, unbounded applause All
the natives keep exceedingly correct time; and, if dancing
consists in easy and gracefully varied positions of the body, the
civilised professors of that useful art might have profited by
the skill of the sable Mimaloo.</p>
<p>At length, from the fiddler's elbow becoming tired, the music
ceased, one dancer threw himself on the ground, and the other
rested his head on my knees; I placed him on a chair, when,
balancing it on the after-legs, his head against the wall, he
threw his legs on the table with all the nonchalance of an Indian
pilot. This free and easy way created much mirth, particularly to
the sailors, who were assembled round the cottage to witness the
amusement.</p>
<p>Marambal then requested to have some water in a basin: which
being brought to him, he squeezed into it honey out of a meshy
fibrous bundle formed from the inner bark of young trees, (the
only method the natives have of retaining honey,) and then
dipping the bundle into the water, he sucked it with great
avidity and seeming satisfaction. Having repeated this several
times, he handed it to Mimaloo, who in the same manner partook of
the refreshing beverage. They remained with us until after tea,
which Marambal and Mimaloo partook of with becoming propriety.
Waterloo's manner was more uncouth.</p>
<p>This scene must have appeared very strange to those who had
formerly witnessed and borne a part in others so totally
different. The same individuals that they had been accustomed, to
consider, to treat, and to fear, as wild beasts, were now found
to be, if not quite tame, at all events, not so maliciously
disposed as represented. Indeed, it was impossible for any
person, possessing common feelings of humanity, not to rejoice at
the happy change brought about, in a great measure, if not
entirely, by the judicious conduct of Captain Barker.</p>

<p><small>ON</small> Friday, the 14th, Captain Laws formed a
party to go to Croker's Island, to pay the natives a visit; and
accordingly, after an early breakfast on board the Satellite, the
party, consisting of Captains Laws, Barker, Dr. Davis, Mr. Clery,
purser, and myself, started in the yawl. Having arrived at the
island, we landed in a small <i>bight</i> a little to the
southward of Palm Bay. Captain Barker, Captain Laws, and I,
struck into the interior, while Mr. Clery, and Dr. Davis, walked
along the shore in search of shells; and the boat was ordered to
ply to windward through Bowen's Straits. After we had walked a
little distance, we came in sight of a considerable tract
entirely free from trees, (here and there a clump of pandanus
excepted,) and exhibiting an agreeably verdant appearance. We
walked across it, and found the soil tolerably good, and
abounding with grass. Skirting the eastern and southern
boundaries of this plain, there is a lagoon of considerable
width, containing water as clear as crystal. We walked some
distance into this, but the water becoming too deep, and the
reeds very high, we were obliged to retrace our steps, which we
found some difficulty in doing.</p>
<p>Having at length got out of the lagoon, we took a detour
southerly, and ascending a rising spot of ground, we had a
commanding view of the plain, which Captain Barker named Laws's
Plains: this tract, by a rough computation, contains about 5000
acres of land, the half of which may safely be said to be fit
for, and would reward the labour and expense of, cultivation. It
is probable that part of it may be overflowed during the rainy
season; but this would be rather advantageous for the growth of
rice,&mdash;at all events, it could be easily drained.</p>
<p>Leaving this spot, we proceeded in a south-westerly direction,
and after a fatiguing walk, we came to mangroves, and experienced
much difficulty in penetrating through the almost impervious
jungle. Arriving at length at a creek, we crossed it by a native
bridge of rather a fragile texture. Issuing out of the mangroves,
we came to a circular sandy spot of some extent, on which we
perceived numerous and recent marks of children, as if they had
been in play. We looked around on all sides, and called out, but
did not meet any of them. During our excursion, we saw fires in
several parts of the island, and fell in with many of the haunts
of the natives: we were somewhat disappointed in not having had
an interview with any of them, particularly as, knowing this
island to be well inhabited, we had anticipated such an
event.</p>
<p>A short walk from this spot brought us to the beach, and we
saw the yawl standing into a fine bay a little to the southward
of us We had not walked far, when we observed some native boys
running towards us, calling out "Commandant! Commandant!" It
appeared evident that they only knew him by name; and it must
have been extremely pleasing to him, to receive such an
unequivocal proof of the estimation in which he was held by these
children of nature.</p>
<p>Others of the natives soon joined us, who in like manner were
only acquainted with the Commandant by name; none of them having
visited the settlement, as far as he could recollect. They
endeavoured to come into the little boat with us; but as it was
sufficiently deeply laden, they were given to understand that a
boat would be sent for them afterwards; and it was accordingly
sent, but they would not come on board. Mr. Clery and Dr. Davis
we found in the yawl; they had not been successful in gathering
shells, and, as the day was hot, they thought it more prudent to
take a sail, than to walk along the sandy shore.</p>
<p>We now willingly betook ourselves to dinner, our expedition
having given us a good appetite. We kept at the same time
coasting along, many of the natives running after us, until
nearly dark, when we anchored, and Captain Barker went on shore
to communicate with them. In a short time, off came my friend
Miago, who expressed much satisfaction at seeing me; he was
accompanied by several others, who received a hearty welcome.</p>
<p>The tide in a short time fell so much, that the yawl was
aground, and we could walk on shore without difficulty. We all
did so, and found many of the natives assembled, and Captain
Barker in the midst of them. We learned that Wooloogary, the
King, was absent, with a number of his people, catching turtle.
His brother, Wadiea, a placid-looking old man, dressed in a
shirt, (which I recognised as having formerly belonged to me,)
received us very politely, and was presented by Captain Barker
with a hatchet,&mdash;an article which is held in the highest
estimation.</p>
<p>The women were at some distance, and we were promised a sight
of them, if we remained until next morning; but although desirous
of obtaining a glimpse of the sable beauties, we did not take
advantage of their offer, which in all probability was not
sincere. To amuse us, as well as themselves, they turned to, and
danced away with much mirth and glee round a large fire, to their
own musical instrument, the <i>ebero</i>.</p>
<p>Being somewhat fatigued from the walk through wood, water, and
mangroves, I lay down on the beach, suffering from headach,
increased by a complete ducking I received by falling into the
creek. Wadeia observing that I did not appear well, came towards
me, and, on understanding that I complained of headach, he
pressed it in the same manner as any civilized nurse would have
done. I requested him to send one of the boys for water: not one
of them, however, would obey him, and, instead of enforcing
obedience, he went for it himself, and, in a short time, returned
with a basket-ful.</p>
<p>Having spent about an hour with them, we returned to the yawl;
and after supper, it was agreed to take a nap for a few hours. At
two, <small>A.M.</small>, we awoke, got under weigh, and plied to
windward. At daylight, we saw three canoes, with two natives in
each, who seemed rather to avoid us, but we would have joined
them, had we not been prevented by a reef that extended a
considerable way from the shore.</p>
<p>We sailed round Mount Norris Bay, and observed that it had
been correctly surveyed by Captain King. We then returned by
Bowen's Straits, which, as Captain King had not passed through,
and as it is the common route of all the Malay proas, passing to
and from the eastward, Captain Laws surveyed very carefully.
Moreover, we noticed that the trepang, the object of their
voyage, abounded here.</p>
<p>About half way through the Straits, on the side of the Cobourg
Peninsula, there is a capacious bay, having a sufficient depth of
water for a first-rate man-of-war, within a few fathoms of the
shore. This bay, which was considered by Captain Laws as a very
eligible spot for a settlement, he named, in compliment to the
Commandant, Barker's Bay. On surveying the bay, we could not help
expressing regret, that the settlement had been so hastily
formed.</p>
<p>We returned to the camp about three, <small>P.M.</small>,
rather fatigued. In the afternoon, the Satellite ship's company
re-embarked, and also the party of marines left by H.M.S.
Success.</p>
<p>On Monday, the 17th, I learned that Langton, overseer of the
prisoners, had taken to the bush, with another prisoner. This
action appeared quite inexplicable, as far as regarded Langton,
who had all along conducted himself with much propriety; and,
from his general usefulness, stood in high favour with the
Commandant. As he was liked by the natives, there is little doubt
that he will be kindly treated by them, until the return of the
Malay proas next season; when, it is presumed that he and the
other runaways will, by representing themselves as having been
left behind by accident, most likely get a passage to Macassar.
They have taken with them a fowling-piece, and a pistol. Eight
soldiers volunteered to proceed in search; but, for obvious
reasons, their services, in this way, were not accepted: and
several prisoners, who were suspected of an intention to run
away, were sent on board the Thompson.</p>
<p>This morning, H.M.S. Satellite sailed for India, and I parted
with considerable regret from those whose society had tended to
enliven many hours, that otherwise would have passed heavily
away; more particularly from my former shipmate and friend,
Lieutenant Robert Campbell, with whom I had visited many
interesting scenes, in various parts of the world.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* I received from him a collection of books,
exactly similar to many I had lost,&mdash;being purchased at the
same time, and from the same bookseller, in the gay Parthenope.
On seeing them ranged in my apartment, I occasionally forgot that
I had left my own copies in Torres Straits.]</p>
<p>Captain Barker forwarded by Captain Laws information of the
abandonment of the settlement to Admiral Gage, the Commander in
Chief, requesting him to give information thereof to the Dutch
Governor of Macassar, to prevent the disappointment that the
Malays might experience, by bringing articles of traffic (as they
had promised) to Raffles' Bay, in the ensuing season.</p>
<p>Tuesday, August 18th.&mdash;Another prisoner took to the bush
this morning, and during the course of the day, two others
followed his example. Between seven and eight o'clock in the
evening, while I was walking from the fort to the cottage, in
company with Dr. Davis, the piercing lamentations of a pig were
distinctly heard, and shortly afterwards, a flash was seen.
Presently, my boy informed me he had heard a "row" in the
stock-yard, and that one of the Bushrangers had "bolted" with a
young pig. We gave the alarm, and the settlement was soon in
commotion. A Serjeant, and several soldiers, marched, in battle
array, into the woods; but, in a short time, returned.</p>
<p>It appears, by this daring act, that the bushrangers are
hovering in the vicinity; they seized the opportunity of the
overseer being absent, just before the moon rose. The overseer,
who returned in time to witness a man running as fast as his legs
could carry him, with a pig on his back, fired, but did no
injury: indeed, it may be, without much injustice, imagined, that
the affair was well understood by the overseer, stock-keeper, and
runaway.</p>
<p>As it was not improbable that all the prisoners for life might
follow their companions, measures were taken to prevent them.
Their plan had evidently been well formed; but, through the
precipitancy of the leading members, caused by intoxication, it
had been put in execution before affairs were properly ripe.
Their intention (as before stated) most probably is, to await the
arrival of the Malay proas; but, perhaps their design may be, to
capture the Governor Phillips, should she arrive after our
departure; and, as this would be a very easy matter, it is by no
means improbable.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the 19th, all hands were busily employed (as
they have been these few days past) in embarking stores,
provisions, &amp;c. from the settlement, on board the colonial
brig Amity, and hired brig Thompson; yet the embarkation did not
proceed so rapidly as could be wished, in consequence of the low
tides, leaving the mud-bank, in front of the settlement, quite
dry.</p>
<p>Thursday, the 20th.&mdash;The night passed quietly, none of
the bushrangers having made a public <i>entr&eacute;</i>. A
little after daylight, as Dr. Davis and myself were going to take
our accustomed aquatic exercise, we descried a vessel at anchor,
near Palm Bay, which we had little doubt was the Governor
Phillips; and, about ten, <small>A.M.</small>, she arrived in
Raffles' Bay, and proved to be that vessel.</p>
<p>By her arrival, the arrangements for leaving the settlement
were altered. Dr. Davis, Mr. Hickey, and Mr. Kent, (who had
arrived in the Governor Phillips, to take charge of the
Commissariat department in King George's Sound,) with a party of
soldiers and prisoners, were to proceed in the Thompson as far as
Swan River; (where, in conformity to instructions from
head-quarters, various stores and cattle were to be landed;)
thence they were to embark in the Amity for King George's Sound.
Captain Barker, and myself, with the remainder of the people and
stores, were to proceed in the Governor Phillips. By letters from
Sydney, Captain Barker was informed of his appointment as
Commandant of the Settlement at King George's Sound, and Dr.
Davis was also to remain there in medical charge.</p>
<p>Friday, the 21st.&mdash;This morning, Wellington, and fifteen
natives, paid us a visit: they appeared sorrowful while beholding
the preparations for our departure. Wellington begged Captain
Barker to take him with him; but, on consideration, it was not
deemed prudent to grant his request. He then begged that Riveral
might not be left behind, and appeared pleased when assured that
she would be taken with us. During the day, Mimaloo and Waterloo,
and a few others, joined the party. In the evening, one of the
bushrangers, named Tobin, came into the settlement, and gave
himself up. He was a poor ignorant Welchman, who had run away,
without any definite notion of what he was doing. As he came to
Sydney, under my care, upwards of five years ago, and, at that
time, could not talk one word of English, I interceded with the
Commandant, who was easily persuaded, not to punish him. On
examining him, he denied having any knowledge of the pig; he also
declared, that he had not seen any of the other "runaway
prisoners; nor had he tasted a single article since he left the
settlement. Although this appeared rather doubtful, yet his
sunken eyes showed that he had not fared very sumptuously during
his ramble.</p>
<p>Saturday, August the 22d.&mdash;This morning, a great number
of the natives, who had slept at a little distance from the
settlement, paid us an early visit, and several of them assisted
in conveying different articles to the beach, on the promise of
being rewarded.</p>
<p>In the afternoon. Dr. Davis, Mr. Kent, and a detachment of the
soldiers, and half of the prisoners, embarked in the Thompson;
and also the native girl, Riveral, (neatly dressed,) after taking
leave of her countrymen, who shook hands with her very
affectionately, and appeared much pleased with, though somewhat
envious of, her good fortune. She left the land of her fathers,
not only without regret, but with much satisfaction, seemingly
delighted to be out of the reach of her sable kindred, towards
whom she invariably evinced great shyness, and even
antipathy.</p>
<p>Sunday, the 23d.&mdash;Early this morning, the settlement was
crowded with natives; many of whom were entire strangers. While
taking the sun's altitude, I was surrounded by upwards of fifty
of them, who viewed my movements with great curiosity. As I could
not perform the object I wished, from their pressing round me, I
requested Wellington to make his people keep out of the way; he
instantly complied with my desire, making his followers form an
open space, so as to admit of the sun's image falling on the
quicksilver,&mdash;he standing on one side, and Monanoo on the
other, to keep the space clear, which they did very effectually;
but not perceiving any visible effects follow my actions, they
seemed much disappointed.</p>
<p>Wellington expressed a wish to go on board the Thompson, to
see Riveral; but, for various reasons, it was deemed better to
divert him from his purpose. Shortly afterwards, all the natives
left the settlement, but encamped in the immediate vicinity, to
be in readiness for a share of the plunder,&mdash;iron and
nails,&mdash;as soon as we were gone.</p>
<p>In the cool of the evening. Captain Barker and myself took a
walk in the woods, where we met three sailors (my old shipmates)
whose walk had been cut short by the appearance of a number of
natives, who, they affirmed, were lying in ambush, for no good
purpose. Convinced, however, that we had nothing to fear. Captain
Barker and myself continued our promenade towards the spot
pointed out by the sailors; but we neither met the natives, nor
saw any traces of them: and it appeared evident to us, that our
informants had imbibed the prevalent opinion regarding these
savages; which is not to be wondered at, as they had heard
terrible accounts of their ferocity from the sojourners at
Raffles' Bay; several of whom were, to the very last, only
restrained from ill-using them, by Captain Barker's example and
authority.</p>
<p>Having prolonged our walk to a considerable distance from the
settlement, we returned by the beach, where we found Wellington's
canoe, (the one he had received from Captain Barker,) and several
things in it. Shortly afterwards, we met Wellington and
Wooloomary, pretty heavily laden with empty bottles, and old iron
hoops; which, they did not fail to inform us, had been given to
them as presents.</p>
<p>After a little friendly chat, we separated,&mdash;Wellington
having promised to bring his wife and children to see us, before
we left his territory: he said she would have visited the
settlement long ere this, had she not been very ill with the
<i>oyi&#275; boyi&#275;</i>.** This excuse of ill health was (as
frequently occurs in civilized society) mere pretence; as, on it
being remarked to him, that most likely all the
<i>yalcuh&eacute;&eacute;</i>*** were labouring under the same
complaint, he and his companion laughed heartily.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Small-pox.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Women.]</p>
<p>Shortly after our return to the fort, while we were at tea,
Serjeant Drew marched in with a fowling-piece and shot-belt, and
informed Captain Barker, that Langton and Fellows (the two
prisoners who first made a start for the bush) had returned, and
given themselves up. They were ordered to the cells, where, by
Captain Barker's request, I visited them. They pretended to be
exceedingly ill; but this was soon found to be feigned, to avert
or to delay the punishment, which, being conscious of deserving,
they anticipated. They were much emaciated, and no doubt heartily
tired of their sylvan excursion.</p>
<p>They declared that they had not seen any of the other
runaways; that they had had no previous communication with them;
and that their intention was to wait for the return of the Malay
proas. They had remained at the fern-creek, and subsisted
entirely on fern roots. Had there been settlers to plunder, or
settlers to screen and protect them, as is common in New South
Wales and Van Dieman's Land, it is not likely that they would
have returned.</p>
<p>On Monday, the 24th, the brigs Amity and Thompson sailed for
Swan River. On the evening of the 25th, Dwyer, another of the
runaways, gave himself up: he had fared better than the others,
by keeping near the beach, where he obtained cockles in
abundance.</p>
<p>The runaways are now all returned, excepting two, who, it is
expected, will speedily follow the others; and that they should
do so, is desirable for several reasons, but principally lest,
being left behind, they might destroy the various animals and
vegetables which Captain Barker intended to leave, for the
advantage of future visitants to this place.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the 26th, all hands were busily employed in
embarking the remaining stores and provisions on board the
Governor Phillips. In the afternoon, Miago and several other
natives visited the deserted camp. While rummaging about the
empty houses, they discovered a <i>plant</i> (according to
convict phraseology) of oatmeal, about fifty pounds, under the
kitchen of the cottage; placed there (as he afterwards confessed)
by Fellows, who was servant to Mr. Hickey.</p>
<p>Captain Barker and myself walked through the public garden
with Miago and his friends, and explained to them, as well as we
could, the nature of the different vegetables that were
flourishing there in great luxuriance. The bananas, some of which
were ripe, and greatly to their taste, called forth particular
admiration. They were informed, and clearly understood, that they
were not to pluck them until they assumed a yellowish hue. The
sugar cane, pine apples, lemons, oranges, papaws, cocoa nuts,
sweet potatoes, and other vegetables, were also pointed, out and
their various properties explained to them. The bamboo
immediately attracted their notice, as being well adapted for
spears.</p>
<p>Whether the natives would wantonly destroy any of the fruit
trees, &amp;c., we could not conjecture; but, from the pains
taken to teach them their utility, we hoped they might refrain
from doing so;&mdash;as for the houses, we thought it likely that
they might be destroyed for the sake of the iron, which the
natives use in pointing their spears, rendering them thereby more
efficient in spearing the turtle.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the 27th, in the morning, I superintended the
placing a tombstone over the remains of Dr. Wood. It was
forwarded from Sydney, in the Governor Phillips, by his
executors. I felt regret that some such mark of remembrance could
not be placed over the remains of my respected friend, Mr.
Radford; where, however, I planted several European flowers, and
also some cocoa nuts, to mark the spot. Several of the natives
were present during the ceremony,&mdash;the intent of which they
appeared to comprehend.</p>
<p>Miago had called me up, before daylight, to receive a tomahawk
which I had promised him the preceding evening; and he stuck by
me until he got it, when he, and all the other natives, departed
into the woods, in search of honey.</p>

Bay&mdash;Departure from the North Coast of New
Holland&mdash;Remarks as to the objects which the British
Government had in view, in the formation of the Settlements on
the North Coast of New Holland, and the causes of their
abandonment.</small></p>
<p><small>ON</small> Friday, the 28th, about noon, everything
that Captain Barker intended to take away being on board the
Governor Phillips, we all embarked, and arrangements were made
for sailing next morning. On Saturday, the 29th, early in the
morning, Captain Barker and myself went on shore to bathe.
Afterwards, we walked through the deserted camp, and visited the
garden, where everything appeared to our eyes more flourishing
than before.</p>
<p>The fort was left undestroyed, for the use of, and under the
care of, Wellington, who promised to take charge of it until we
returned. The carpenter of the brig nailed the union-jack to the
flagstaff; and although it was an old one, and hardly worth the
carrying away, yet it may last until replaced by another, which
we all hoped might, ere long, be displayed,&mdash;if not here, at
least on some contiguous part of the coast. The settlement was
then abandoned;&mdash;Captain Barker being the last to
embark.</p>
<p>For the information of future visitants, I may state that the
garden contained orange, lime, and lemon trees, bananas in
abundance, shaddocks, citrons, pineapples, figs, custard apples,
papaws, tamarinds, dates, cocoa nuts, arrow root, sugar cane,
peaches, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, turmeric, capsicum, black
pepper, and many other useful and ornamental articles, all of
which were thriving well, except the figs and peaches: and
Captain Barker, with a view to increase the probability of their
continuance, made the gardener plant several of them in different
convenient places, not far from the settlement,&mdash;viz., on
the north lagoon, 130 bananas, six cocoa nuts, and four areca
ditto; on the grass tree flat, near the small rivulet, at the
head of the bay, fifteen bananas; on the flat, near Cook's cliff,
fifteen bananas; near the swamp, eighteen papaw trees, eighteen
custard apples, and eighteen bananas.</p>
<p>Moreover, that future settlers might not be under the
necessity of eating salt-junk; he left, poultry,&mdash;a boar and
several sows, in a place where it is likely they will thrive and
increase, being a swamp, abounding in fern and other roots, of
which they are fond;&mdash;also a bull and three cows; and (even
attentive to the convenience and ease of future sojourners) a
Timor horse; and a mare in foal which he purchased from Dr. Davis
expressly for this purpose.</p>
<p>Some fears are entertained that the two bush-rangers who have
not returned may, from malicious wantonness, destroy both animals
and vegetables. Necessity would not compel them to do so, as
there is no doubt of their having stowed away plenty of beef,
oatmeal, and flour; and there was a sufficiency of pumpkins to
supply the wants of 100 men. If they act with prudence towards
the natives, there is little doubt of their not only surviving,
but living sumptuously, and in idleness (the <i>summum bonum</i>
of such people), until the arrival of the proas from
Macassar.</p>
<p>All being on board, and the brig ready for sea, we got under
weigh about ten, <small>A.M.</small>, and coasted along the
shore. Being anxious to examine Port Essington, we ran into it,
and came to an anchor about seven, <small>P.M.</small>, in eleven
fathoms water, near Knocker's Bay; and shortly afterwards, we
observed numerous signal fires of the natives at Point Smith.</p>
<p>Next morning, at daylight. Captain Barker and myself left the
brig, and proceeded in the boat to examine Knocker's Bay. It
appeared exceedingly commodious in all respects, excepting the
absence of fresh water, which defect might very easily be
remedied. Returning on board about nine, <small>A.M.</small>, we
observed the natives making signals on shore; and shortly
afterwards, two canoes, full of men, (seven in one, and eight in
the other,) were observed making towards the brig. When the first
approached sufficiently near, the natives began calling out, and
still continued, though slowly and cautiously, to advance. As
soon as they recognized Captain Barker and myself, they gave a
loud and joyful shout, calling out "Commandant", "Caraie",* when
both canoes pulled with all speed, and the men jumped on board
without hesitation.</p>
<p class="foot">[* This is their name for doctor. I have no doubt
it is their manner of pronouncing Caradg&#275;, which they may
have heard from Dr. Davis, who, however, never would coincide in
this opinion.]</p>
<p>They proved to be some of our old friends; among whom, were
Marambal, Iacama, Luga, and Mimaloo, bringing with them a
quantity of tortoise-shell, for the purpose of barter. They were
kindly received on board, and regaled with plenty of biscuit and
rice. Marambal using the freedom of an old acquaintance, took the
oil out of the binnacle lamp to mix with his rice. After their
refreshment, some presents were distributed among them: they
inquired very particularly after Riveral, some of whose relatives
were present, whom I had not previously seen. I was much struck
with the mild and unassuming manners of one of them, hitherto
unknown to me, named A-rain-boo; but feeling that old
acquaintances ought always to have the preference, I dressed
Mimaloo in a pair of white trowsers; a red handkerchief was put
round his neck, and a piece of calico on his shoulders, over
which two bits of spun-yarn supported his trowsers; and, to
complete his dress, a soldier's wife very gallantly put a cap on
his head, which, although it was not particularly clean, he
received with a bow and a smile.</p>
<p>This finery completely turned his brain, and he jumped about
the deck, cutting a variety of capers, all indicative of the most
extravagant joy: then he would stand still, silently
contemplating his figure, with all the self-admiring complacency
of a thorough-bred dandy; and again, unable to suppress his
satisfaction, he would burst afresh into movements of
unrestrained delight, to the astonishment of all on board, both
savage and civilized;&mdash;although his pleasure was somewhat
damped by one of the soldiers calling him a <i>Manburg&#275;</i>.
I thought that A-rain-boo viewed his gestures with pity, and
seemed to despise him for thus compromising his dignity in our
presence.</p>
<p>Captain Barker gave Luga (the native who had been flogged) a
<i>mambrual</i>, and also remembered Marambal, who had behaved so
attentively the first time he had trusted himself among them.
Shortly afterwards, the natives left us, promising, that should
Captain Barker and I come on shore, we should have a sight of the
<i>yalcuh&eacute;&eacute;</i>; but they, unlike their civilized
sisters, showed no disposition, either to form an acquaintance
with, or to be admired by, strangers.</p>
<p>Shortly after the natives left the ship, those in the first
canoe called to us to observe their mode of killing turtle, one
of which they had discovered resting on the water. Luga stood in
the bow, and threw the spear, but missed his aim. Those in the
second canoe having seen another turtle, requested us to witness
their superior skill, but they proved equally unsuccessful, to
their great chagrin and mortification. Their feelings, no doubt,
were much of the same kind with those experienced by a "<i>white
fellow</i>", who, with the intention of impressing the wandering
savages with a favourable idea of his prowess, fires a musket
among a numerous flock of cockatoos, without doing any
damage.</p>
<p>As the brig could not get under weigh, in consequence of the
wind setting in to blow from the W.N.W., we embraced the
opportunity of taking a further view of Port Essington (where,
had the settlement been originally formed, it is probable that it
might have now been in a flourishing state); and accordingly,
about three, <small>P.M.</small>, Captain Barker and myself
proceeded on our expedition. We passed Point Record, and
continued our course to the western branch of the bay; near the
head of which. Captain Barker had, some time previously, found a
fine stream of fresh water, and he now wished to see if it still
continued to run.</p>
<p>We landed at a point near the south-west side of this inner
bay, and walked in a westerly direction, where, at about one mile
and a half distance, we expected to fall in with the stream.
Having walked, however, twice that distance, without meeting with
it, we began to suspect, from the nature of the ground, that no
stream of water existed. Captain Barker was now convinced that we
had landed at the wrong spot; the place he had previously landed
at, being situated one mile farther to the southward. This we
very much regretted, as, from the day being spent, we could not
strike across the country to endeavour to fall in with it. It
being now quite dark, we thought we might have some difficulty in
retracing our steps to the place where the boat lay waiting for
us; but, knowing that we had taken a westerly direction, we
reversed the course, and, guided by the stars, (after several
tumbles over fallen trees,) we got safely to the boat, where we
found the men anxiously expecting us. We arrived on board about
three o'clock in the morning, after a long and very tiresome
pull.</p>
<p>When Captain Barker visited Port Essington, on a former
occasion, he found the stream in question of considerable
magnitude, and, from appearances, he was induced to believe it to
be permanent; but, as his visit was shortly after the conclusion
of the rainy season, this was by no means certain. Had it been
running now, at the termination of the dry season, the matter
would have been placed beyond a doubt. It was, therefore, to be
regretted, that we did not succeed in deciding the question.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning, the 31st of August, the brig was got
under weigh, and we left the north coast of New Holland exactly
six years after the date of Mr. Barnes's letter to Lord
Bathurst.</p>
<p>It may not be out of place now to make a few remarks as to the
formation of these settlements, and also as to the events which
unfortunately led to their abandonment.</p>
<p>The principal object in forming a settlement on the north
coast of New Holland was, to establish a commercial intercourse
with the natives of various islands in the Indian Archipelago;
and which, it was imagined, might be brought about through the
means of the Malays, who annually frequent these shores in
considerable numbers, for the purpose of procuring trepang.</p>
<p>The British government, therefore, (chiefly induced, I
believe, by the representation of Mr. Barnes, who painted in
glowing colours, the vast and manifold advantages thence to be
derived,) determined to form an establishment somewhere on the
northern coast of New Holland; and, to carry this resolution into
effect, Captain Bremer, of H.M.S. Tamar, sailed from Sydney on
the 24th of August, 1824, taking in company the ship Countess of
Harcourt, laden with stores, provisions, and other articles
necessary in the formation of a new settlement. A party of the 3d
regiment, under the command of Captain Barlow and Lieutenant
Everett, and a party of prisoners, chiefly mechanics, (who
obtained the name of volunteers,) were also embarked in the
Countess of Harcourt.</p>
<p>They proceeded through Torres' Straits, by the inner passage,
and arrived safely at Port Essington on the 20th of September;
when, after going through the ceremonies usual on such an
occasion, formal possession was taken of the north coast, between
the meridians 129&deg; and 135&deg; east longitude; and, after
making some ineffectual search for water, they left this
beautiful bay, and proceeded farther west.</p>
<p>On the 30th of September, they arrived at Melville Island,
where they formed the settlement. Thus was an error committed in
the very beginning. Had the examination for water at Port
Essington been more extended and minute, plenty, of good quality,
would have been discovered; and the port is, in every point of
view, decidedly preferable to that of Apsley Straits, than which,
indeed, a worse place could not have been selected: first,
because the entrance to it is exceedingly intricate, on account
of a dangerous shoal extending several miles' distance from the
land; and which is rendered more perilous by the rapidity of the
tides. And, lastly, but chiefly, by this part of the coast not
being frequented by the Malays; although this fact could not have
been known at the time.</p>
<p>On the 13th of November, H.M.S. Tamar left for India, having
rendered every assistance to the settlement. Previous to her
departure, the natives had visited the new comers, (whom, I have
no doubt, they considered unwelcome intruders,) and some slight
differences had occurred. The settlement, however, got on pretty
well for some time; but, at length, hostilities commenced between
the natives and Europeans, and proceeded, from bad to worse,
until the hatred of both parties became thoroughly rooted.</p>
<p>From all the accounts I could collect, and I had them from
various and authentic sources, I have no hesitation in stating,
that the civilized party was far from being blameless.</p>
<p>It is well known to every person who has had the slightest
intercourse with savages, that they are invariably addicted to
thieving. It is, therefore, not to be denied, that the natives
committed many petty thefts; but the policy of being
unnecessarily annoyed thereat, and the humanity of putting them
to death for such offences, may be safely called in question.</p>
<p>If I am rightly informed by those who were actors in the
business, many of the natives were put to death in a very
unwarrantable manner; and I think I may assert, that, had mild
and conciliatory conduct been adopted, and uniformly continued
towards these ignorant creatures while their depredations were
unattended with violence, several valuable lives might have been
saved, and many inconveniences and privations prevented.</p>
<p>Latterly, it was unsafe to venture out of the camp
unarmed;&mdash;a melancholy instance of this insecurity occurred
in the massacre of the surgeon and the commissariat-officer, who,
while taking a walk a few yards from the settlement, fell victims
to the vengeance of these irritated and undiscerning savages.</p>
<p>Shortly after the formation of the settlement, sickness made
its appearance. I was in Sydney when alarming accounts of the
unhealthiness of Melville Island arrived there; and, as the
surgeon of the settlement wished to be relieved, a young man who
had just arrived in the colony, surgeon of a trading vessel. was
appointed to succeed him, who, owing to the desperate nature of
the service he was to be employed in, received a salary of one
guinea per diem. Both before and after this period, the accounts
were greatly exaggerated, and, in some respects, incorrect; the
unhealthiness of the settlement being generally, but very
erroneously, ascribed to the insalubrity of the climate.</p>
<p>The disease which, either by itself, or aggravating other
maladies, naturally mild, caused such alarm, was scurvy, which,
it is well known, is not endemial; indeed, it is more prevalent,
<i>c&aelig;teris paribus</i>, in a cold, than in a warm climate.
Its rise and progress is, therefore, to be attributed to the
operation of the usual causes; several of which, in this
instance, conspired to produce it.</p>
<p>This disease, therefore, not caused by climate, might have
been checked, if not entirely prevented, by means within the
reach of the sufferers; and, by a prophylactic attention to
dietetics, without requiring much aid from medicine.</p>
<p>It is admitted, that the supply of salt provisions was bad;
but, then, the fowls of the air, and the fish of the sea, might
have been obtained in abundance, by very moderate exertions: and,
until the various vegetables (with the seeds and roots of which
they were amply supplied from Sydney) grew fit for use, they had,
within their reach, plenty of native roots and vegetables, which,
either from ignorance or carelessness, they failed to profit
by.</p>
<p>But as the climate was reported unhealthy, so was the soil
accused of sterility; and with what degree of justice may be
learned from the statement of Captain Laws, who visited the
settlement a few months previous to its abandonment.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** Vide page 152.]</p>
<p>With respect to the policy of the line of conduct pursued in
the public administration of the settlement, I am not capable of
forming a correct judgment; yet I may mention, that the
instructions given in the first instance to the Commandant were
liberal; and had other circumstances been favourable, were likely
to promote, in some degree, the ultimate object for which the
settlement was formed: but the orders of the 22d of April, 1826,
(which, I am informed, were of a conditional nature,) being
strictly acted on, put a complete stop to the slender mercantile
intercourse that had begun, though slowly, to take place.</p>
<p>To add to the misfortunes attending on Melville Island, the
colonial brig Lady Nelson, which was stationed there, sailed to
Timor for refreshments, and was never afterwards heard of.
Whether she fell into the hands of pirates, or whether she was
wrecked on some reef or sand-bank, (many of which abound in the
Timor Sea,) is still, and may, perhaps, for ever remain, a matter
of uncertainty.</p>
<p>At length, after a period of nearly four years, in consequence
of the continued unfavourable reports transmitted to the Home
Government, orders were given to abandon the settlement; and, in
willing obedience to these orders, it was abandoned on the 31st
of March, 1829; the live animals, stores, plants, &amp;c., being
transferred to Raffles Bay. The Commandant, with the soldiers and
volunteers, (<i>i.e.</i> prisoners) sailed in the barque Lucy
Anne *** for Sydney, and arrived there in safety on the 10th of
June.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** A few days after their departure, they had a
narrow escape from shipwreck, as may be evident from the
following extract of a letter from the commander of the Lucy
Anne:&mdash;"On the 11th, expecting next morning to make Carter's
Island, and the night being fine, with a light air, we continued
under easy sail, going from one to two knots, with orders to call
me, if any soundings at midnight; when, about half-past one in
the morning, we ran ashore on a sandy part of a reef. It being
fortunately smooth bottom, and little or no swell, so that she
seldom beat, and that pretty easy, we had her afloat and at
anchor in four and a half fathoms, and a second out in six
fathoms, before daylight; at which period, a slight breeze
rising, we cast with a spring, and stood off north-east, and at
daybreak saw an Island with little shrubs, about five or six
miles, apparently the centre of the reef."]</p>
<p>Although there are different opinions as to the policy of this
proceeding, yet, on the whole, it may be considered judicious; as
the settlement was attended with considerable expense, and
unlikely to become of much importance, being, as before
mentioned, entirely out of the track of the Malay proas, not one
of whom had ever visited it. But it might have made some return
to the mother country, especially as it abounds in various kinds
of trees fit for every purpose of domestic economy, and also for
ship-building, according to the opinion of Captain Laws, whose
judgment on such subjects cannot be called in question.</p>
<p>Having made these few general observations, relative to
Melville Island, I shall proceed to give a slight sketch of
Raffles Bay (the second-formed British settlement on the north
coast of New Holland); and as, during my sojourn there, I had
much intercourse with the Aborigines, and embraced every
opportunity of acquiring information concerning them, my remarks
may, perhaps, not be deemed altogether devoid of interest.</p>

account of the occurrences attending the formation of the
Settlement, and also the narrative of a Lascar, relative to the

<p><small>JUDGING</small> from the accounts received, respecting
the settlement at Melville Island, that it was likely to prove a
failure, and being unwilling to abandon the north coast of New
Holland, the Home Government determined to make another
trial.</p>
<p>Captain Stirling, of H.M.S. Success, being charged with the
execution of this important commission, sailed from Sydney,
accompanied by three merchant vessels, which conveyed the troops,
volunteers, provisions, and stores.</p>
<p>On the 17th of June, 1827, they arrived at Raffles Bay,* where
it was determined to form the new settlement, without spending
time in search of a more desirable situation.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Raffles Bay was discovered by Captain King, on
the 16th of April, 1820, and so named by him, from his having had
an opportunity of forwarding a letter to Sir Stamford Raffles by
a Malay proa, several of which he met, for the first time, on
that day.&mdash;<i>Vide King's Australia</i>.]</p>
<p>Various reasons, which it is now needless to mention, have
been assigned for this supposed precipitancy. Suffice it to say,
the settlement was formed on the 18th of June, and named, in
honour of the day. Fort Wellington.</p>
<p>Having been favoured, by the courtesy of the Colonial
Government, with an inspection of all the official documents,
relative to Melville Island and Raffles Bay, I have availed
myself of this privilege on several occasions, and am thereby
enabled to present the reader with the following extracts from
the diary of Captain Smyth, the first Commandant of Raffles Bay;
and, as they afford a concise account of events which occurred in
the formation of the settlement, they will, I have no doubt, be
considered very interesting.</p>
<p class="negindent"><small><i>Memorandum of passing events, from
the commencement of the New Settlement at Fort Wellington, in
Raffles Bay, on the Northern Coast of New
Holland.</i></small></p>
<blockquote>"Sunday, June 17th, 1827.&mdash;Came to anchor in
Raffles Bay, at eleven, <small>A.M.</small>, three and a half
fathoms water, about a mile from the shore. Surveyed by Captain
Stirling, and selected by him as the fittest situation on which
to found the new settlement, on the north-east side of the
bay.<br>
<br>
"The bay appears capable of sheltering any number of vessels, but
the water is shoal for a mile from the shore; even small boats
cannot get in at low water, except at one point, about three
quarters of a mile from the camp, to the N.N.W."<br>
<br>
"Monday, June 18th.&mdash;Early this morning, sent parties on
shore, protected, with tents, &amp;c., which were immediately
fixed, at four, <small>P.M.</small> Captain Stirling, with part
of the officers and crew of H.M.S. Success, came on shore; also
myself, and detachment from the Lansdowne, when the British flag
was hoisted, and possession taken of this land by Captain
Stirling, in the name, and on the behalf of. His Majesty King
George the Fourth;&mdash;the Success firing a royal salute, the
39th and marines a <i>feu de joie</i>, concluding with three
hearty cheers, which were answered by the crew remaining on board
the Success, Marquis of Lansdowne, and Amity and Caledonian
brigs. The settlement is named, by Captain Stirling, Fort
Wellington, in honour of the anniversary of that day's
achievements at Waterloo."<br>
<br>
"Tuesday, June 19th.&mdash;Hoisted the union at sunrise. Troops
and mechanics employed in disembarking cattle, and securing them
on shore. Employed all hands, after breakfast, in bringing public
stores on shore. About forty of the crew of the Success, under
the command of Lieutenant Belcher, R.N., commenced their
preparations for building a substantial log-house and battery.
Gardener employed in preparing ground for seeds and plants."<br>
<br>
"Friday, June 22d.&mdash;Ten or twelve of the natives seen about
a mile from the camp, to the west. They fled on the approach of
the watering party from the Lansdowne, leaving two spears and a
wamero on the ground, which were brought off by the officer in
charge of the watering party."<br>
<br>
"Saturday, June 23d.&mdash;Our whale-boat being very leaky,
having suffered considerable injury in the passage, needed
repair, and I placed her under the shade of some mangrove trees
at the water's edge, about 300 yards off the camp. Lashed her by
stem-and-stem, and took out the plug, that she might fill at high
water. Cabbage and raddish seeds sown this day. At ten,
<small>P.M.</small>, the native dogs made an incessant howling in
the vicinity of the camp."<br>
<br>
"Sunday, June 24th.&mdash;Seamen drew their seine at daylight;
caught an abundance of mullet, some few soles, bream, and a
variety of nondescripts. I tried the settlement seine (which, in
fact, is not one as specified in the invoice, but a common net,
without a purse or cod); caught no fish. Received a mess from the
Success's boat for all hands. Fired the dry grass round the camp,
having ranged men to stop it within certain limits; it burnt most
furiously. Sent another party in search of the heifer that had
strayed: one of the party being a little in the rear of the
others, was chased by a number of natives with spears (about
seventy or one hundred), who fled on his reaching his party."<br>
<br>
"Monday, June 25th.&mdash;Peach slips put in the ground.
Collected a quantity of trepang, of which there is an abundance
lying in the mud along the shore; boiled some, and reduced it
nearly to a jelly. I conceive it may make very good soup when we
know how to dress it. The largest and finest specimens are grey,
with a light grey belly: the black are not numerous, and very
small. I can perceive no difference in favour of the latter, when
made into soup. Some very fine light brown clay was brought me by
one of the prisoners. Potts, a potter: he pronounced it to be
very good for any purpose to which clay is applied, and reports
that there is a bed of it, of some acres, about three miles to
the south, near a river. I shall ascertain the truth of this
circumstance as soon as time will permit."<br>
<br>
"Tuesday, June 26th.&mdash;Success's crew and ourselves employed
from daylight till sunset, as usual. The heat very oppressive;
myriads of the green ants on every tree, excessively annoying to
the workmen; the flies, also, are intolerably numerous and
troublesome, and particularly attack the eyes; most of the men
find it absolutely necessary to put something over the face as a
safeguard, and, even with this precaution, I have some men with
sore eyes. Gardener put some potatoes in the ground this day. At
nine this morning, discovered the whale-boat was gone from her
birth. Sent an armed party along the coast to the N.W., and went
in the same direction in a boat myself; found she had been taken
by the natives to the mouth of a small fresh-water river, about
three miles off, hauled up, high and dry, and stripped of every
particle of iron about her; both ends opened, and rendered
altogether useless. The ship's pinnace brought her back. Seeds
sown on Saturday appeared above ground. Four sentinels on duty
this night."<br>
<br>
"Saturday, June 30th.&mdash;Gardener, this day, planted sugar
cane. This night, we were disturbed by the natives, and about two
o'clock I heard the sentinel challenge: I arose, and was informed
by him that ten or twelve had come within a few yards of him; the
darkness of the night prevented his seeing them sooner, when he
challenged, and they fled. I went on the beach, and, with a
lanthorn, found, by the tracks of their feet, that the sentry was
correct. At daylight, I discovered they had taken two iron pots
from the place of cooking, not more than fifteen yards distant
from my tent, but found them, in the course of the day, evidently
dropped in the hurry of their retreat. There were marks of their
spears in the sand. Captain Stirling sent me an additional force
of eight seamen, with cutlasses, at sunset, to assist in the duty
of the night."<br>
<br>
"Sunday, July 1st.&mdash;About 150 hammocks, belonging to the
Success, and on shore to be lettered, had been purloined during
the night by the natives; also a rope jack; all within forty
yards of the sentry, on the south-east of the camp. The first
Lieutenant of the Success, and a party of twelve marines, at
noon, went in an easterly direction, to discover the source of
the small river which empties itself where the wreck of our
whale-boat was discovered; and, in their research, fell in with
about twenty-five of their hammocks, but saw no natives. At noon,
I went with an armed party in a north-east direction, where I had
heard of the strayed heifer, and found her, but so wild, that I
could not get within 300 yards of her. I shall, however, when we
can spare time, form some stratagem to get her in; she is in good
pasturage, and close to the river, and, as yet, unmolested by the
natives."<br>
<br>
"Monday, July 2d.&mdash;Stowed the greater part of the dry goods
in the excavated part of the logged house; the soil is a perfect
dry sand; was surprised to find that, even for the short time
they had been under the canvas, the white ants, in myriads, had
assembled, and made great encroachments on the barrels. Marines,
soldiers, and volunteers very active in erecting each their
respective hut. The French dwarf beans, planted only three days,
made their appearance. Orange and lemon slips put in the ground.
At twelve, noon, the cooper, with some other men of the Success,
were at the watering place, repairing the butts, when a party of
natives, with spears, came on them; they retreated, and some of
their tools were taken: one spear was thrown, without injury. The
camp was instantly on the alarm, and pursued, but no traces could
be seen of them. At eleven, this night, immediately after the
moon had set, the natives were heard, and imperfectly seen, not
more than thirty or forty yards from the sentry, on the
south-east flank, who challenged them, when (he reports) they
approached on him the faster; he fired at them, as did also two
others of the guard, in the direction they retreated, who came
instantly to his assistance. A boat from the Success came ashore,
to know what was the matter."<br>
<br>
"Tuesday, July 3d.&mdash;As the natives had, the preceding
evening, made their advances towards the Success's forge, and
probably attracted by the hope of getting iron, it was removed
this day into the centre of the camp. I ordered all lights to be
extinguished early, that they might not serve as a guidance to
any encroachment on the part of the natives. The evenings are
beautifully serene and pleasant."<br>
<br>
"Wednesday, July 4th.&mdash;The natives, under cover of the
darkness of the night, again made their approaches at about two,
<small>A.M.</small>, crawling on their hands and knees. The
sentry fired, and I think without effect, as no cry was heard;
they instantly disappeared. They approached us on the south-east
point, but had been seen by the Success, in great numbers, at an
earlier part of the evening, on the north-west point. There is no
possibility of discovering their movements. I had this day given
directions to the guard, that the sentries should remain totally
inactive and quiet, if no more than two or three of the natives
made their appearance, and allow them to get sufficiently into
the settlement to secure them."<br>
<br>
"Thursday, July 5th.&mdash;Again, at about two in the morning, I
heard the natives at the back of the settlement, and quietly
turned out all hands. Planted about an acre and a half of seed
maize, which I found very indifferent, and have but little hope
of its growing: it appeared to have been heated in the cask. I
sowed, also, a small patch of wheat, in which wevils are in
abundance. Six eighteen-pounder carronades this day landed from
the Success for the Fort."<br>
<br>
"Friday, July 6th.&mdash;The back of the camp again visited by
the natives. The sentry saw them, but they went off when he
challenged. The sugar cane is come up, and looks well."<br>
<br>
"Saturday, July 7th.&mdash;I received a message from Captain
Stirling about half-past two this morning, to say, great bodies
of the natives were just round the north-west point, about half a
mile from us; the point hid them from us. We prepared ourselves,
but they did not come; they were heard by the sentry at the back
of the camp, and a jagged spear was found at
daylight,&mdash;supposed to have been thrown at the serjeant of
marines, who had been on the alert near the spot, during the
morning."<br>
<br>
"Sunday, July 8th.&mdash;At noon, a party, consisting of
Lieutenant Carnac, three midshipmen, and twenty marines,
accompanied by Dr. Wood, again made an excursion into the
interior, in a more easterly direction than before, not having
then succeeded in finding the source of the river. It was
expected they would have been able to return by five or six
o'clock at farthest, but did not come in till two,
<small>P.M.</small>, the following day, having lost their way,
and broken their compass. Guns were fired from the Success, at
intervals, during the day and night, none of which were heard by
them. Native dogs were in numbers in the camp this night, but as
they appeared harmless, I directed they might not be
molested."<br>
<br>
"Monday, July 9th.&mdash;Captain Stirling announced his intention
of leaving the bay in a fortnight. The heavy logs being completed
in the house, the framing of the upper part was commenced. The
stockade far advanced. The 39th and volunteers employed in their
huts; the marines in erecting a fence, to enclose the camp. No
interruption during the night."<br>
<br>
"Wednesday, July 11th.&mdash;I have not, as yet, seen any stone
likely to be serviceable, nor are there shells, in any
quantities, for the purpose of making lime. The coast is composed
of hardened clay, and conglomerate, and towards the interior
strongly impregnated, with iron."<br>
<br>
"Friday, July 13th,&mdash;Working parties continued as usual. At
seven, <small>A.M.</small>, a party from the Success hauled their
seine about a mile to the south-east, and, on leaving the beach,
eight or ten natives came down. I proceeded towards them with
Lieutenant Belcher, of the Success, directing the whole of the
remainder of our party to retire to the camp. With some
difficulty, we prevailed on them to allow us to come up to them
with some fish, biscuit, and a few other trifles: the
extraordinary jealous caution they maintained induces me to think
they have, more than probably, been dealt treacherously with by
the Malays, of whose visits, on all the small islands contiguous
to the main land (but not on it), there are many evident proofs,
such as places for boiling the trepang; a sort of wicker work on
which to dry it, &amp;c. These natives were armed with spears,
three or four each, some of them jagged; one was pointed with
iron. perhaps a part of the plunder of our whale-boat. We gave
them what few things we had, and, in return, the chief presented
me with a small purse, suspended from his neck, containing
shells, neatly netted, and with much the same mesh used by us.
The material appears to be the stringy bark. We left them much
more composed, and, as far as signs could be understood, with a
promise to return to-morrow at the same time. Night passed
tranquilly."<br>
<br>
"Saturday, July 14th.&mdash;At eleven, <small>A.M.</small>,
eighteen of the natives came down to the fishing beach, about a
mile from us. The surgeon, Mr. Belcher, and myself, went to them
with some biscuit, and a few other little presents; they were
much pleased, but still observed a vigilant and distrustful
caution, and remained but a short time. Three,
<small>P.M.</small>&mdash;Two of the native chiefs have been in
my tent, and are now on board the Success. Four,
<small>P.M.</small>&mdash;Returned, much gratified with dresses
given them on board, and gone to their tribe: this circumstance,
I hope, will entirely put a stop to their nocturnal visits. While
they were near my tent, close to which the wrecked boat, and the
recovered rope-jack (which was found buried in the mud) were
lying; neither of them appeared to notice the one or the other. I
did not think it necessary to remind them of these circumstances
in so early an acquaintance. They are generally strong, muscular
men, infinitely more so than the description of natives in the
neighbourhood of Sydney. Some of them were daubed over from the
crown of the head to the ancle with a kind of pipe clay. No
disturbance this night."<br>
<br>
"Sunday, July 15th.&mdash;Seven of the natives came into the
camp, and were fed, and shown over the place. Much surprise was
manifested by them, and particularly when I showed them the use
of the gun, by bringing down two large hawks, of which there are
vast numbers. The power of pistols also astonished them, and they
begged we would not use them again, as it gave them great pain in
the head. Mr. Belcher and myself, wishing to show we had every
confidence in them, went with them and joined their party of
about twenty, at a distance of about three miles to the S.S.E.,
near the beach. We afterwards hailed the jolly-boat of the
Success, with Mr. Carr and four midshipmen in her, and with two
of the chiefs got in, and went across the bay to the west, about
five miles, where they gave us to understand was their great
place of assembly. After getting on shore, about thirty, with
spears, made their appearance; but, by order of their chief, laid
them down, and approached us with most extraordinary attitudes
and gestures. They were eager to lead us to their place of
general rendezvous, and we followed them for about two miles on a
well-beaten track; but as the sun was near down, and one or two
instances of daring theft had taken place, I thought it prudent
not to go further; and, to the evident disappointment and
displeasure of the sable group, we returned to our boat. The two
who were left as a guard in her had been strongly entreated to
follow us into the wood, which induces me to think they had in
view the pilfering of the boat at parting. They presented us with
a spear, which we understood as a token of friendship. The bones,
and three or four skulls, on the beach, engaged our attention,
but they showed signs of great displeasure at our approaching
them, and we desisted. The night passed perfectly tranquil."<br>
<br>
"Tuesday, July 17th.&mdash;The natives (twelve) came into the
camp, and were given biscuit, &amp;c. One assisted in blowing the
forge; another in scrubbing the hammocks of the Success. I was
anxious to establish a perfect good understanding with them, and
did not check it. Early in the afternoon, they left us, and went
two miles at least along the beach, in our sight, when two of
them (the leaders,** and to whom we had been particularly kind,)
struck into the wood, came up to a party cutting wood, and,
remaining a few minutes, seized on an axe, and ran off. Two
soldiers followed them near to their general assembly, when a
large body came out with spears, and with much difficulty the
soldiers escaped. This night, they again began their marauding
system in the early part of the night; it was dark, but the guard
heard them in all directions round the camp. I considered their
faithless conduct did not deserve lenity, and <i>I ordered the
several sentries to fire whenever they approached.</i> One shot
was fired, and no more was heard of them. The Mary Elizabeth
arrived in harbour at six, <small>P.M.</small>, all hands well,
and cargo safe. She has been to Melville Island, not knowing
where to find us, and being without a chart of the
coast."</blockquote>
<br>
<p class="foot">[** Wellington and Waterloo.]</p>
<blockquote>"Thursday, July 19th.&mdash;The natives were more
bold last night, and came into the forge. A shot was fired at
them, and they disappeared. Tools and everything are carefully
put out of their reach each night. The Success's men conclude
their assistance to us this day. Three guns only are mounted. Mr.
Hicks reports his having been in Port Essington some days, and
that the harbour is very superior, in every respect, to this; the
soil much better, and exceeding good water in wells. He also
states, he found one small stream. The natives made an attack
upon him, and his party, and hurt one man considerably by a blow
on the arm with the waddy. The party retreated, and fired in
return. Mr. Hicks brought a Portuguese, belonging to Madras, from
Cape Flinders, who had been wrecked in the Frederic, Captain
Williams, a trader, about seven years ago; himself, and two
others only, escaped in a small boat, and got ashore, where they
both died, leaving himself the only survivor. We saw the man
making a signal, by waving a branch when we passed two days
before the Mary Elizabeth came there; but mistook him, from his
colour, to be one of the natives. He is anxious to get on to
Madras. I have given directions that he receives rations during
his stay with us."<br>
<br>
"Friday, July 20th.&mdash;Two of the natives, the men who had
stolen the axe, had the assurance to come into camp.
Unfortunately, some officers of the Success received them in a
friendly manner: it was my intention to have handcuffed one of
them until his comrade brought in the stolen axe; however, I
merely showed my displeasure at their conduct, and ordered them
out of the camp to fetch it. At a few yards distance, one of
them, with a look of expressive contempt of me, took up a frock
from the ground, and away they both started, in the face of the
whole camp. A pursuit took place, but they ran too fast for us.
The frock, however, was dropped in the flight."<br>
<br>
"Saturday, July 21st.&mdash;Received a letter from Captain
Stirling, acquainting me that he should weigh and depart on
Monday. Sunk a well a short depth; the water very good; some pipe
clay in about three feet from the surface. A man, of the name of
Thompson, of the Success, is missing; has not been seen since
three, <small>P.M.</small>, yesterday."<br>
<br>
"Sunday, July 22d.&mdash;A party, under the command of Lieutenant
Belcher, of the Success, are gone out in search of Thompson;
fears are entertained that he has strayed from the settlement,
and fallen in with the natives. Uninterrupted by natives last
night."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>Mr. Duncan, assistant-surgeon of H.M.S. Satellite (who was
assistant-surgeon of H.M.S. Success, when the settlement was
formed) favoured me with an extract from his journal, which, as
it also gives an authentic account of the proceedings, from the
formation of the settlement until the sailing of the Success,
together with the curious narrative of a shipwrecked Lascar,
cannot fail, I think, to be perused with much interest.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>"On the 15th June, 1827, made Croker's Island; at 8h.
30' <small>A.M.</small>, the Success struck on a sand bank: Cape
Croker E.N.E., main land S. by E.; at noon anchored in Palm Bay,
in five and a half fathoms. Shortly afterwards a boat, &amp;c.
was sent on shore. At seven <small>P.M.</small> they returned,
reporting that they had seen a few of the natives, but that they
did not speak to them, and that no water was to be found here. We
remained all next day, and at five, <small>A.M.</small> on the
17th weighed and sailed for Raffles Bay; at eleven,
<small>A.M.</small> anchored at about half a mile from the shore;
at five, 30th, <small>P.M.</small> 18th June, the union jack was
hoisted on shore, twenty-one guns were fired from the Success,
and two rounds of musketry were fired by the marines, &amp;c. on
shore.<br>
<br>
"On the 22d, a party of marines, &amp;c. accompanied with a
midshipman, and also a part of the crew, &amp;c., of the ship
'Marquis of Lansdowne', went on a short excursion towards the
interior; on the same evening they returned, stating that they
had found a small rivulet of fresh water to the right of the
settlement, but that they saw none of the natives. For these two
days past there has been seen a few of the natives in a small
sandy bay to the left of the settlement. On the 24th, whilst a
party of our men were fishing, a few of the natives came within a
short distance of them; our people left some fish for them, and
returned on board, on which the natives came down and took them
away.<br>
<br>
"On the night of the 26th the natives carried away a whale boat
belonging to Captain Smyth, and rendered her completely useless.
She was found next morning near the mouth of a small rivulet to
the northward of the settlement, the greater part of the iron
work being taken out of her, and her planks, &amp;c. broken in
various places, some parts of which were carried some distance
into the bush, several pieces of which I have seen during my
excursions into the woods. At 11h. 30' <small>P.M.</small> on the
30th, they again came into the camp, on purpose (it was supposed)
to pilfer: one of the sentries snapped his musket at them, and
gave the alarm. On a blue light being burned as a signal to the
Success for assistance, they immediately retired into the woods,
carrying away with them some of the cooking utensils. Next night
they carried away, for a short distance from the settlement, the
rope jack belonging to the ship, which they buried in the sands,
where it was found shortly after; they also stole a quantity of
hammocks belonging to the Success, which were scrubbed on
shore.<br>
<br>
"On the 2d July, at one, <small>P.M.</small> a party having gone
on shore watering at the Lagoon, they filled their casks, and
came off to the ship, leaving the cooper and another behind them
repairing casks and making bungs for the same; the natives made
their appearance on the opposite side, and hove a spear across at
the men, (I do not know if our men had given them any provocation
or not) the cooper, &amp;c. fled, leaving his tools, buckets,
&amp;c., behind, which the natives carried off only to a short
distance, they being immediately pursued by the settlers on the
alarm being given, on which they dropped the greater part of the
stolen articles. In the pursuit, some of the hammocks that the
natives carried away were found in a tree, &amp;c. None of the
natives were taken. The same evening some of them were seen to
the eastward of the settlement, and they, at eight,
<small>P.M.</small> came down in a body of about thirty to near
the place where the sentry was placed; he fired at them, but it
was supposed he did no injury, as no wounded or dead remained
behind.<br>
<br>
"On the morning of the 4th July, at two, <small>A.M.</small>,
they again made their appearance, crawling on all-fours, but were
again seen and fired at by three soldiers or marines.<br>
<br>
"On the 8th July, a party of our people, headed by our first
Lieutenant, went on an excursion, with only one day's provisions;
the same day our party went up to the west side of the bay, where
the natives have often been seen. On approaching a small sandy
bay the natives made their appearance, with their spears in an
attitude of defence. On a handkerchief being thrown to them, they
went into the water, but they did not wish our men to land. In
the evening, the party that left the settlement on the 8th
returned, having for some time lost their way. They did not see
any of the natives.<br>
<br>
"On the 11th, at about ten, <small>A.M.</small> seven of the
natives came down on the beach, near the Lagoon, carrying their
spears. Captain Smyth and Mr. Belcher went up to them and gave
them some articles; two of them, who were named Wellington and
Waterloo, came into the settlement along with them&mdash;they
were bedaubed over with red clay. After eating some biscuit,
&amp;c. they joined their companions, and returned into the
woods. Whilst the two chiefs remained in the camp, the other five
natives stood at a short distance, with their spears in their
hands.<br>
<br>
"At one, <small>P.M.</small> on the 14th, the natives again came
down and joined some of our people on the beach; at three,
<small>P.M.</small> two of them came off to the ship, in company
with Mr. Belcher and Mr. Carr. After they had seen the different
parts of the ship, shaved and clothed, they were again sent on
shore; during the time they remained on board, their companions,
to the number of fourteen, remained on the beach, and were quite
rejoiced to see the two chiefs arrive on shore.<br>
<br>
"On the 15th, seven or eight of them came down, with the two who
were on board the Success: they remained only for a short time;
in the afternoon a party went out sailing, they landed on the
opposite shore, in a sandy bay, where the natives had often been
seen. Their canoes were on the beach. On the approach of the
boat, several of the natives appeared, and made signs to our
people to go on shore, which desire they complied with. There
were several human bones lying on the sands, but the natives did
not wish our men to touch them, but made signs to the men to
follow them into the woods, which they did for a short distance;
but being unarmed, and some of the natives making rather too
free, they thought it most prudent to return. Whilst in the woods
with the natives, one of them stole a handkerchief from our
Lieutenant. On Wellington knowing of the theft, he immediately
made the man return it. It was then offered to Wellington, but he
would not accept of it until they returned to the beach.<br>
<br>
"On the 17th the natives, about twelve in number, came down,
accompanied by Wellington; they employed themselves, along with
our men, cutting wood, turning the rope jack, and stirring the
rice, which was boiling for the ships company's dinner. On the
same afternoon, one of the natives stole a large axe, after he
had seen and tried its use. The people who were cutting wood
followed them, but the natives presented their spears at them.
Our people being unarmed were obliged to retreat, and the thief
got clearly off.<br>
<br>
"At 6h 40' <small>P.M.</small> the Colonial brig Mary Elisabeth
arrived, bringing along with her a native of India, whom she
picked up on one of Flinders Islands. At 11h. 40'
<small>P.M.</small> the natives came into the camp, about twenty
in number, and advanced near to one of the sentries: he fired at
them, but did no injury. The natives immediately fled.<br>
<br>
"On the 18th July, the Lascar came on board the Success, and from
him I learned the following particulars:&mdash;" That he belonged
to the ship Fame, which was wrecked in the Straits; that he and a
few others escaped in a leaky boat, after rowing for forty-eight
hours. On landing, the natives stripped them of their clothes,
&amp;c. but otherwise behaved kindly towards them. His companions
in misfortune died the first year of his residence amongst the
natives, which in all amounted, he said, to six or seven
years.<br>
<br>
"The men in that part of Australia have from five to ten wives,
of whom they are rather jealous at times. The tribes are
continually at war with one another, and have regular pitched
battles; but the moment that one is killed on either side, the
battle ceases until they carry off their dead, and mourn for
certain days, according to their customs, bedaubing themselves
over with black earth, and on another day the fight begins and
ends in a similar way.<br>
<br>
"When one dies or is killed, they bury the body in the earth, but
at the end of five days dig it up again, and wrap up the bones,
&amp;c. in bark of trees, and carry them along with them. When
the women fight, which is very often, they use a short kind of
club. The natives paint their bodies over with red clay to
prevent the musquitoes from biting them. When they paint their
bodies white it is a sign of war with some other tribe.<br>
<br>
"Their marriage ceremony is performed in the following
way:&mdash;The father and mother of a female child lead in one
hand between them the intended bride, (whilst in the other hand
they each carry a piece of burning wood,) towards the intended
husband, he standing with his back towards them. When they arrive
at the appointed place, the parents lay down the burning pieces
of wood, beside which the child sits down, and the parents
retire, on which the husband turns round to his wife and takes
her home. She stays only with him during the night, returning to
her parents during the day, until she has attained a more mature
age.<br>
<br>
"Their food consists chiefly of fish, kangaroo, turtle, wild
yams, and various other roots. They have no regular times for
meals, and eat at any time they can find any thing to subsist
upon.<br>
<br>
"On that part of the coast they have canoes hollowed out of the
trunks of trees, a work of great labour, as they have no iron
tools; in these they often paddle from the main land to the
neighbouring islands in quest of food. They worship no superior
being, nor have any knowledge of one. They obey and reverence the
eldest of their tribe. They keep their elderly men and wives at a
distance when they fight or go to war. They would not allow this
Lascar to go to their battles, although they gave him a wife of
their tribe, by whom he had several children.<br>
<br>
"They punish an adulterer, when detected, with death. They have
no knowledge of ships; their chief conversation is either
concerning food or war. There are very few diseases amongst them,
and they in general live to a good old age. They employ
themselves in hunting or fishing during the day, and at night
sleep round a small fire. When a brother dies and leaves a wife,
the next eldest brother marries her. They have no houses or any
thing to cover them; and scarcely two tribes speak the same
language.<br>
<br>
"The natives were greatly attached to this Lascar. When he hailed
the brig, they placed their hands on his mouth; on the approach
of the boat to carry him on board the brig they fled, but again
returned; but would not go on board the vessel. Although this man
knew and could speak the language of the tribe with whom he had
lived, understood only a few words of the language spoken by the
Raffles Bay and Port Essington tribes. He suffered greatly from
the bites of musquitoes, and small ulcers on the skin; as well as
from the change of diet during his first year's residence amongst
them. He buried the other Lascars who died. The natives were
desirous that he would take up their bodies again according to
their custom, but he did not comply with their request. This man
we left on board the Mary Elizabeth, in Raffles Bay, although he
was desirous to return to India.***</blockquote>

<p class="foot">[*** This person, named Paul De Sois, was
forwarded to Coupang, from thence he went to Batavia with Mr.

informed me, he was so excessively lazy, that his request was not
complied with. He was forwarded to Madras, his native place,
where, he said, he had a wife and several children.]</p>
<blockquote>"On the 18th July, during the night, the natives came
in and attempted to steal the armourer's forge, &amp;c. but were
seen and fired at by the sentry. Next day, at 11h. 30'
<small>A.M.</small> they again made their appearance on the
beach. They appeared more shy to-day than usual, and would hardly
come down to the tents, although the Indian native tried to
persuade them, but went in quest of honey. About five,
<small>P.M.</small> they returned. An axe was shown to them
similar to the one they had stolen some days before. And, being
informed that they would not be allowed to come into the camp
until they returned the stolen axe, the chief grinned at Captain
Smyth, and showed his posteriors in rather an indecent attitude,
then ran off, picking up in his way some of our people's clothes.
In attempting to escape he was fired at by Mr. Carr, but without
effect. A dog pursued him and made him drop his prey.<br>
<br>
"The same evening one of the men belonging to the Success was
missed; but some time after the Success sailed, he returned to
the settlement, in company with some natives, and joined the
brig. Search was made for this man for a considerable distance
round the settlement on the 22d, but to no effect. From the night
that the natives were last fired at (21st July) to the 23d, the
day that the Success sailed for Melville Island, the natives did
not make their appearance."</blockquote>

Wood&mdash;Malay Proas visit the Settlement&mdash;Extracts from
the Medical Report of Dr. Davis&mdash;Observations on Melville
Island and Raffles Bay, by Captain Laws, R.N.&mdash;Proofs of the
healthiness of the Climate.</small></p>
<p><small>BY</small> the preceding accounts, it appears that
hostilities soon commenced. There can be no doubt that the
natives, by exercising their pilfering habits, were the
aggressors. The whale boat was stolen * and broken in pieces for
the sake of the iron; and, whenever the Aborigines appeared
afterwards, the sentries fired at them without ceremony. This was
not the best way to gain their confidence, or to teach them
better manners; and that they were capable of being taught, was
very evident from the conduct of Wellington in the affair of the
Lieutenant's handkerchief. It appears also that they soon became
on intimate terms with the sailors,&mdash;assisting them in their
various occupations,&mdash;until, unfortunately, "after having
seen and tried its use," one of the natives ran away with an axe.
Who, knowing their habits, could be surprised at such an
action?</p>
<p class="foot">[* This may appear very culpable. It is far more
excusable, however, in these untutored beings, than the same
crime when committed by those calling themselves
<i>civilized</i>. Several instances of <i>civilized</i>
delinquency are within my knowledge, one of which I may
cite:&mdash;The master of a government colonial brig, picked up a
canoe belonging to the natives, and without hesitation took it on
board, and rigged it for his own use; thereby robbing a whole
family of the principal means of gaining their subsistence. Yet
this action was never imagined to be in the slightest degree
dishonest; and the mate, from whom I heard the anecdote, seemed
surprised that any one should consider the captain's conduct
reprehensible, more particularly as the natives stole all the
canoes they had from the Malays.]</p>
<p>A few days afterwards, Wellington came to the camp, when he
was given to understand that the stolen axe must be returned,
which was undoubtedly very proper; but, "<i>est modus in
rebus</i>", there might have been a milder and more persuasive
method of communicating the demand than by holding an axe in one
hand, and catching the Chief by the back of the neck with the
other. It is not to be wondered at, that Wellington, being thus
treated, should have expressed his indignation rather
indecorously.</p>
<p>After these occurrences, it is somewhat astonishing that the
seaman missed the same evening from H.M.S. Success, was not
massacred by the natives in revenge for the insult offered to
their Chief, instead of being accompanied by them in safety to
the camp.</p>
<p>When the Success quitted the new settlement, Captain Stirling
left a party of marines, to add to its security. The natives
still continued to commit acts of theft; and it was reported that
they attacked men in the woods, without, however, doing them any
visible injury. They were very cautious in approaching the
settlement,&mdash;and well they might,&mdash;as they were fired
at without distinction. A tribe of them appeared in its vicinity,
and were saluted with an eighteen-pounder, loaded with
grape-shot; but, owing to the inaccuracy of the gunner, none of
them were killed. This occurrence had the effect of preventing
their re-appearance for a long time.</p>
<p>A few months afterwards, a soldier of the thirty-ninth was
speared at a very short distance from the camp. The wound was
dangerous, and the man's life was despaired of He, however,
ultimately recovered.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** This appears to have been the first act of
aggression on the part of the natives. I omit their various
endeavours to possess themselves of iron, &amp;c.]</p>
<p>This act of cruelty very justly demanded the serious notice of
the Commandant, and it was determined that a severe example
should be made of the culprits.</p>
<p>A party of the military (and, I believe, also of the
prisoners) were dispatched in search of the natives. They came
unexpectedly on their camp at Bowen's Straits, and instantly
fired at them, killing some, and wounding many more. A woman, and
two children, were amongst the slain; another of her children, a
female, about six or eight years old,*** was taken, and brought
to the camp, and placed under the care of a soldier's wife. After
this, the natives kept aloof from the settlement; and it was as
well that they did so, as almost all the soldiers were, more or
less, affected with scurvy, which prevailed here in as great
vigour as it did at Melville Island.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Riveral, or Mary Raffles.]</p>
<p>In the midst of the sickness, the settlement was deprived of
medical aid for several months,&mdash;the surgeon, Dr. Wood,
having died three months after his arrival. Thus harassed with
disease, and in a state of perpetual alarm, on account of the
natives, it need not appear strange, that the accounts, written
at this time by the sojourners, were in a tone of gloomy
despondency.</p>
<p>On March 28th, several Malay proas being observed passing the
bay, Captain Smyth dispatched Mr. Macleod, the storekeeper, to
invite them into port, and he was successful in his embassy. A
few of them visited the settlement, when the Commandant offered
them protection, and assistance in curing their cargo: they were
much gratified thereby, and expressed their satisfaction at
being, for the future, as they hoped, under British protection.
They spoke of the Dutch as acting in a manner most oppressive and
unjust towards them. They were also delighted at the prospect of
being protected from the natives, who wage war with them, and
steal their canoes whenever they can find an opportunity.</p>
<p>Captain Smyth was succeeded in the command by Lieutenant
Sleeman, of the same regiment, on the 24th of April, 1828, and,
at the same time, Dr. Davis, the assistant-surgeon, arrived, to
take the medical charge.</p>
<p>The Doctor having heard very doleful accounts of the
settlement, and being called instantly, on his arrival, to visit
a person dangerously ill, and having observed the woeful
countenances of the settlers, he became convinced of the truth of
the sad relations he had previously been made acquainted with,
respecting the unhealthiness of the climate.</p>
<p>He was quite convinced that affairs were even worse than they
had been represented, as he saw "visceral disease" strongly
depicted on every countenance; and, under these impressions, he
made a corresponding report to head-quarters very shortly after
his arrival.</p>
<p>However, being gifted with sound sense, and much
discrimination, it was not long before experience taught him that
he had too hastily (and without sufficient reason) coincided in
the generally-received opinion regarding the climate, which he
was not ashamed publicly to avow.</p>
<p>He observes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"My opinion of this climate has undergone a great
change, and it is now different from what I was induced to form
from the received intelligence of last year. There is no
'endemic' disease here. The climate of this place surpasses every
other as far as I know, which are equally as near the equator;
and were it not for the great height of atmospheric temperature,
I should consider this climate one of the best in the
world."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>In another report, he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"This climate has been represented as unfavourable to
European constitutions. I am authorized to declare, after a
residence of fifteen months, that it is by no means so bad as was
imagined. The prevalence of sickness which took place after the
formation of the settlement, can be accounted for as arising from
more satisfactory causes than that of climate. The people were
unavoidably harassed in clearing ground, felling timber, and
building huts, at the same time that the salt provisions, with
which they were supplied, proved to be of a very inferior
quality, and hardly fit for use: these, with annoyances from the
natives, and the gloom and despondency which the death of the
surgeon excited, quickly operated in producing scurvy, which was
the principal disease amongst the men. A liberal supply of
medical comforts, and a superior description of food, have been
provided for their use; and, as disease now seldom occurs in any
serious form at this settlement, it may be fairly stated, that
the climate, instead of being unhealthy, is less so than any
other place equally near to the equator.<br>
<br>
"I was, on my arrival, inclined to consider, that the proximity
of the settlement to the Lagoons, with an extensive mud bank in
front, (which is occasionally exposed to the influence of the
sun,) would tend to make febrile diseases very prevalent, and
otherwise operate to the injury of our health; but my conjectures
have not been verified. Nothing in the form of epidemic, or
contagious disease, has been observed, and the greater proportion
of the diseases which have occurred, are to be attributed to the
want of a due quantity of vegetable food.<br>
<br>
"From the experience of the past year, and from the measures
adopted by our present Commandant, Captain Barker, of the
thirty-ninth regiment, the settlement will be prepared to meet
the effects of the ensuing season. A good supply of vegetables
from the Government garden has been afforded to all for the last
six months, and encouragement has been given to the people to
make gardens, and cultivate vegetables, for themselves.<br>
<br>
"From the high temperature of the climate, 81&frac12;, an almost
constant flow of perspiration is induced; and the people,
although generally complaining of not possessing as much bodily
strength as heretofore, look more healthy than could at first be
imagined. The health of some men, delicate on arrival here, has
much improved: this has been particularly noticed among the
prisoners of the Crown.<br>
<br>
"The rainy season commenced in October, and continued, without
intermission, till the end of May. The wettest month has been
February, and a greater quantity of rain fell in that month than
in the preceding six months together.<br>
<br>
"It was during the rainy season, the preceding year, that the
settlement was visited with the most sickness; and we naturally
looked for its approach with no small share of concern. But the
troops possessed better health through that season than at any
former part of the year.<br>
<br>
"The present season is very healthy; the atmosphere is agreeably
warm during the day, and cold in the night, and early part of the
morning. The troops occupy themselves in active exercise, and
very little illness is to be observed among them. No deaths
occurred within the year.<br>
<br>
"The temperature of the climate is not liable to quick
transitions; and although, in the summer months, the atmosphere
is very hot, and at times oppressive, few cases of fever, or
other acute disease, at that period prevail, even among those men
who are obliged to be much exposed to the sun's influence."
*</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Annual Medical Report, from June 21st, 1828,
to June 20th, 1829, by R. M. Davis, M.D.]</p>
<p>In further corroboration of this opinion regarding the
healthiness of the climate, I shall here introduce the
observations of that experienced officer Captain Laws, which also
afford much other valuable information concerning the settlements
on the north coast of New Holland.</p>
<blockquote>"I found both the settlements at Raffles Bay and
Melville Island amply supplied with fresh provisions, and
perfectly healthy. At the former there were three in hospital,
one soldier and two convicts; at the latter, they had not had a
man on the sick list for two months before, or during our stay;
and neither establishment had had an instance of death since the
present officers arrived, which was in April last (1828).<br>
<br>
"At Raffles Bay there have been only three deaths since the
formation of the settlement, the first of which was the surgeon.
This circumstance left them without medical assistance for nearly
seven months, during which period the other two died, an infant
and a convict (disease not known).<br>
<br>
"At Melville Island I could not learn the number of deaths, there
being no records on the island. At different times four or five
had been killed by the natives, in consequence of coercive
measures adopted towards them; since which they have quite
estranged themselves from both settlements.<br>
<br>
"Since the formation of these settlements, they have been under
the immediate military government of an officer of one of the
regiments at Sydney, 'whose turn it was for detached duty',
without reference to his habits, interest, or inclination;
indeed, so far from the latter, that a Commandant at Melville
Island told me that he hesitated whether he would not give up the
army rather than go to that station; and since his arrival he has
never been half a mile from the house he occupies; the
consequence is, that what they have seen has been with jaundiced
eyes, and their representations made accordingly, describing the
climate to be such as to preclude the possibility of keeping the
settlement, and the soil incapable of producing any thing fit for
the sustenance of man.<br>
<br>
Now, looking at the number of deaths, and considering that every
individual at both settlements are natives of Great Britain or
Ireland; and that none of the officers, and not more than six of
the men, had ever resided within the Tropics before, a tolerable
estimate may be formed of the climate, which I do not hesitate to
say is one of the best within the torrid zone,&mdash;indeed the
difference we felt between it and India, was surprising. We had
no instance of sickness during our stay in these seas, though I
am convinced, had our people been as much exposed in wooding and
watering in any part of either the East or West Indies, we should
have had many cases of fever, if not of death. The principal
disease appears to have been scurvy, the presence of which may be
attributed to a want of the most ordinary precaution, owing to
the inexperience of the individuals themselves, there being many
indigenous roots and vegetables, among which are yams,
arrow-root, and a kind of parsnip, together with a pea or
calavance, and an abundance of the Palmyra cabbage, so invaluable
to all the natives of Hindoostan. To obtain these, it is required
to climb the tree, which they did not attempt, but procured a
scanty supply by cutting it down to get a single cabbage; and
none of the other vegetables have been used, except by two or
three individuals, although the natives appear to almost live on
the roasted yam.<br>
<br>
"The whole of the coast that we saw, from Cape Helvitius to
Croker's Island, is well wooded; and, as far as the settlers have
penetrated (about four miles), they have met with a variety of
valuable timber&mdash;amongst which is the lignum-vitae, two
kinds of teak, a native oak, a species of sandal-wood, and
lance-wood, with several others well known and much used in
India, from their not being obnoxious to the worm or white ant,
which none of the above are, according to the experience of the
settlers, who found these insects wherever they have been, and
the largest forest trees, of particular kinds, completely
destroyed by them.<br>
<br>
"A singular characteristic of the country is, that, except just
above high water mark, (where in most places it is overrun with
mangroves,) there is no underwood; even in the thickest part of
the forest the trees are a considerable distance apart, and
between them the ground is covered with high grass, on which all
the stock, whether brought from Sydney or Timor, appear to thrive
very well.<br>
<br>
"During the dry season, by setting fire to the grass, a road is
made sufficient to enable them, with the assistance of draft
oxen, (which they have at Melville Island,) to choose their
timber, and bring it in any quantities to the settlement.<br>
<br>
"I have landed, at the Colonial Dock-yard here,** specimens of
the timber at Melville Island, with the intention of sending it
by the first transport to one of the dock-yards in England for
the inspection of the Commissioners of the Navy. I selected a
common sized tree of the teak, oak, lignum-vitae, and blood-wood;
the latter I was obliged to abandon, it being too large and heavy
to carry on our decks through a boisterous latitude, I therefore
only brought an arm of that tree, which, with the teak, would be
very valuable at Calcutta or Madras, as well as in
England.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[** Port Jackson.]</p>
<blockquote>"With respect to the soil, every thing that has been
managed with the smallest knowledge of its properties, grows very
well; but it would appear incredible, were I to attempt a
description of the inconvenience they have experienced from not
having any one familiar with the productions of a tropical
climate.<br>
<br>
"On asking if they had attempted to grow rice, I was told that
they had, but little of it came up; and on further inquiry, I
found they had sown the clean rice, instead of the grain in its
natural state of paddy,&mdash;this will give an idea of the
clumsy way things have been done in these settlements.<br>
<br>
"At present all works are suspended under an impression that the
two establishments are to be concentrated at Port Essington,
which is certainly the most eligible port at present known for a
principal settlement on the north coast of New Holland, being
about four miles by land from Raffles Bay, and 170 by sea from
Melville Island, and all three in the same degree of
latitude.<br>
<br>
"I cannot help thinking it would be a great sacrifice to abandon
those settlements, now the principal privations and difficulties,
necessarily attending the formation of any new colony, are
surmounted. It would be better to form another at Port Essington,
it being the annual rendezvous of the Malays of Macassar and
Arroe Islands, who come over with the end of the easterly
monsoon, to collect and cure trepang for the China market; though
last year finding there was an European settlement at Raffles
Bay, three proas, with about thirty men in each, took their
quarters up at the fort, and collected and cured what they could,
so as to sail with the end of the monsoon. The natives are
particularly hostile to the Malays, which made them very glad to
have the protection of the fort.<br>
<br>
I understand that one of the objects in forming these settlements
was to open a trade with the Eastern Islands and China, which
would be very easy from the great number of proas (ten or twelve
per day having been seen from the fort) that annually visit the
coast, from Macassar and the islands eastward, to collect and
cure trepang for the Canton market; most of which bartered with
the Dutch residents among the different islands, sent thence from
Amboyna and Batavia, and from thence to China.<br>
<br>
"But, as a tropical climate must be uncongenial to the manual
exertions of Europeans, I conceive it would be a much more
efficient and less expensive plan to colonize New Holland
principally from India.<br>
<br>
"Port Essington should be the penal settlement for the British
possessions in the Indian seas; and every encouragement should be
given to emigration from Calcutta and Madras, (in the miserable
avenues of which hundreds are dying daily,) and at once a
garrison should be formed, with two companies of the Ceylon
regiment, with all their attendants; any of whom, by walking half
a mile from the camp, would find plenty of the vegetables they
had been accustomed to eat all their lives, which vegetables the
English soldier (who thinks of no other resource than the
commissariat) looked upon as poison.<br>
<br>
"I had an instance of this in my own servant, (a native of
Trincomalee, and of the Gentoo cast,) who, in a quarter of an
hour, collected vegetables to make a curry, and therefore to him
a dinner.<br>
<br>
"At Timor as at Java, Malacca, and Penang, all the artisans are
China men, who only require to know we have settlements on New
Holland, to come over in great numbers, and their usefulness can
only be truly estimated by those who have visited any of the
above colonies."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>As far as my own observations and experience go, I perfectly
coincide in opinion, as to the healthiness of the climate; I was
accustomed to use a great deal of exercise, even in the middle of
the day, which would have been extremely hazardous in India. When
Captain Laws, Captain Barker, and myself, took an excursion to
Croker's Island, we were occasionally up to the middle in water,
and exposed for hours to the influence of an unclouded tropical
sun. We rested during the night in an open boat, subjected to the
nocturnal dew; and the greatest part of next day we were again
exposed to the sun; yet none of us felt the slightest ill effects
from the expedition. Had we acted in the same manner in some of
the other tropical climates, we should not, in all probability,
have lived forty-eight hours longer.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** While at Coupang, I once walked a few miles
into the interior during the heat of the day; hardly was I
returned, when I felt very unequivocal symptoms of fever. By
prompt measures, I averted the attack; but thus admonished, I
was, in future, more careful in my pedestrian excursions.]</p>
<p>On my arrival in Raffles Bay, I found every person, not only
in good health, but in <i>good condition</i>; and during my
residence there, I observed no complaint amongst the people, (I
omit those who came in the Amity from Coupang) excepting
ophthalmia, which occasionally prevails, but generally in a mild
form.</p>
<p>Every man, woman, and child left the settlement in perfect
health; and, notwithstanding the melancholy accounts related of
it, only three deaths occurred during the entire period of its
occupation, viz., Dr. Wood, and, after his decease, (and before
another medical man arrived,) a prisoner and an infant died. It
may be observed, that three deaths occurred shortly after my
arrival; but then it is also evident, that these casualties were
not occasioned by the climate of Raffles Bay.</p>

Wellington&mdash;General appearance of the Land on the North
Coast of New Holland&mdash;Character of the Aborigines of Raffles
Bay&mdash;Recapitulatory Observations&mdash;Alleged Causes of the
Abandonment of Melville Island and Raffles Bay proved to be
without foundation.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> bay (on the east side of which the camp was
formed) is small, very safe, and of easy access; the water of no
great depth, but sufficient for vessels of moderate burden. The
fort, situated in latitude 11&deg; 15' 4" south,* and in
longitude 132&deg; 24' 57" east,** was substantially built of
wood, and surrounded by pallisadoes; the ground-floor served as a
receptacle for provisions and stores, and above was the residence
of the Commandant. To the south of the fort were the soldiers'
quarters, and to the north, were those of the prisoners; to the
east, the marines had erected their dwelling, on the roof of
which, surmounted on a pole, were the cardinal
points;&mdash;these, together with the hospital, guard-room, the
cells, and a few straggling huts built without art or elegance,
(except a neatly finished cottage, the residence of the
Commissariat and Medical officers,) constituted the camp.</p>
<p class="foot">[* By means of many meridional altitudes of the
sun, and of stars, south and north of the zenith.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** By means of upwards of one hundred lunar
observations.]</p>
<p>This deficiency of buildings did not arise from any supineness
on the part of the existing authorities, but in consequence of
orders from head-quarters not to erect any expensive buildings;
as it was probable that the settlement might be removed to Port
Essington.</p>
<p>The greatest attention was paid to horticulture;&mdash;besides
the garden, sometime formed, and abounding in useful and
ornamental articles, there was another of considerable extent,
fenced in, and the ground properly prepared for use, when the
orders came to abandon the place.</p>
<p>The site of the settlement was by no means judiciously
chosen;&mdash;an extensive mud bank being right in front of it,
through which, at low water, people embarking or disembarking
were obliged to wade nearly a furlong. About a quarter of a mile
farther to the northward, there was a much more eligible spot,
where permanent buildings were intended to be formed, and which
might easily have been erected, as good clay abounded.</p>
<p>Captain Stirling was actuated in his choice of the site by its
being near a fresh water lagoon; that the people might be
protected from the natives while procuring water&mdash;but water
could not always be procured, as the lagoon was dry, excepting
during the rainy season. The settlers, however, procured a
sufficient supply of good quality from a well, about thirty-seven
feet deep, within a few yards of high-water mark.</p>
<p>In selecting a spot for a settlement on the northern coast of
New Holland, it is not essentially necessary that there should be
water; as abundance of it might be caught during the rainy
season, and retained in tanks and reservoirs, which could very
easily be constructed. In this respect, therefore, there is a
decided advantage over those places where the fall of rain is
neither plentiful nor certain. Here it is invariably
so;&mdash;and it is surprising that this circumstance has never
been taken into consideration.</p>
<p>The appearance of the land about Raffles Bay has been compared
by some to the coast of Orissa in Bengal, and by others to
Demerara;&mdash;the fact is that the land here is exceedingly
low, as it almost invariably is on the north and north-west coast
of New Holland, and in this respect it bears a resemblance to
either of these places; but the similarity exists no farther, as
here there is neither underwood nor jungles to create and foster
effluvia inimical to health.</p>
<p>But low land in a tropical latitude, although generally
considered unhealthy, is not invariably so&mdash;neither are high
lands always healthy. Raffles Bay, although little above the
level of the sea, is decidedly healthy; while Timor, not much
nearer the equator, although in many places exceedingly lofty, is
(as well as Batavia) celebrated as the grave of Europeans.</p>
<p>It may be supposed that this remark applies only to Coupang,
which, like Batavia, is situated low; but that the interior, like
that of Java, may be comparatively healthy. While at Coupang I
was particular in my enquiries on this head; and was informed
that in the sickly season, which occurs shortly after the
commencement of the easterly monsoon, (<i>i.e.</i> the cessation
of the rainy season) the high lands afford no protection against
disease, which rages there with as much fury, and as insidiously,
as it does at Coupang.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** I am surprised that Captain Stirling
mentions Coupang as a healthy place. It may be so at certain
seasons of the year; but I found it widely different.]</p>
<p>The soil, as far as examined, cannot in general be called
good; there are, however, several fertile patches; but it would
not answer either in an agricultural or pastoral point of view.
Admitting that the land was good, and capable of producing
valuable crops, yet the price of labour would prevent its being
cultivated with advantage, especially as it is situated so near
to India, whence rice could be procured at a very low rate.</p>
<p>Although in the quality of wood it falls short of Melville
Island, yet there is a sufficiency, well enough adapted for
ordinary purposes.</p>
<p>The bay abounds with various kinds of excellent fish, but from
want of a proper seine the quantity caught was not very
considerable. The Satellite's people (being better provided) had
no difficulty in catching an ample supply daily, not only
sufficient for the ship's company, but also for all in the
settlement. The Malays caught fish readily with a hook, but none
of our people had any success by that method.</p>
<p>It may not be out of place now to give a few particulars as to
the character of the Aborigines of this part of New Holland.</p>
<br>
<p>In personal appearance they bear some resemblance to the
natives about Port Jackson. They are, however, better made, and
possess more intelligent, and perhaps more savage
countenances,&mdash;they go entirely naked, and their shoulders,
breasts, <i>nates</i>, and thighs, are ornamented with
<i>cicatrices</i>, resembling the braiding of a hussar's jacket.
Their hair is long, generally straight, and powdered with red
earth.</p>
<p>Some of them wear a fillet of net work, about two or three
inches wide, bound tightly round the waist, and a similar
ornament round the head and arms; and sometimes a necklace of net
work hanging a considerable length down the back.</p>
<p>Many of them have the front tooth in the upper jaw knocked out
in the same manner as the Port Jackson natives mentioned by
Captain Collins. They paint their faces, and frequently their
entire bodies, with red earth; those who are inclined to be
<i>dandies</i>, draw one or two longitudinal lines of white,
across the forehead, and three similar on each cheek; and a few
who appeared to be <i>exquisites</i>, had another white line
drawn from the forehead to the tip of the nose. The nasal
cartilage is invariably perforated; but it is only on particular
occasions that they introduce a bone or piece of wood, and
sometimes a feather through it.</p>
<p>In this part of the coast, the natives are divided into three
distinct classes, who do not intermarry. The first and highest is
named <i>Mandro-gillie</i>, the second, <i>Manbur-g&#275;</i>,
and the third, <i>Mandro-willie</i>.</p>
<p>The first class assumes a superiority over the others, which
is submitted to without reluctance; and those who believe in real
difference of blood amongst civilized nations, might find here
some apparent ground for such opinion, as the
<i>Mandro-gillies</i> were observed to be more polite, and
unaffectedly easy in their manners, than the others, who, it was
supposed, were neither so shrewd nor so refined: this, however,
might be only imaginary.</p>
<p><i>Mariac</i> (or Wellington as he was named by Captain
Stirling), the chief of the country round Raffles Bay and Port
Essington, is apparently about thirty-three years of age, nearly
five feet eight inches in height: he limps in his walk, but
whether from a wound received in foreign or domestic war, I did
not learn. His features are regular, and, while he is in a good
humour, placid and benign; but, on the least displeasure, which
arose frequently from slight causes, they gleamed with savage
fury.</p>
<p>He has evidently much sway among his tribe; as even Miago,
although so much in favour with us, has been observed to fall
back, by a look and a word from his chief. From Miago's
possessing a turn for fun and mimickry, and his unrivalled
dexterity in throwing the spear, he had become a favourite in the
camp, to the great annoyance of Wellington, who seemed to view
him in the same light that Haman did Mordecai.</p>
<p>Wellington gave Captain Barker to understand, that presents to
any of his people should only come through himself; and he
occasionally exhibited so much ill-humour at deviations from this
request, that Captain Barker thought it prudent to <i>cut</i> him
for some time.</p>
<p>The natives generally go in parties of from six to twelve;
Wellington, however, usually went at some distance apart,
accompanied only by one. When the settlement was formed, his
attendant was Iacama, a Manburge (called, by Captain Stirling,
Waterloo).</p>
<p>Miago had then the honour of being his travelling companion,
but lost the office, from the attention he received in the camp.
He was succeeded by Olobo, a Mandrogillie, as timorous as a hare.
When we left the settlement, Monanoo, the younger brother of the
chief of Croker's Island, held that distinguished employment.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say whether they are accompanied in their
excursions by their women, but it is probable that they are not.
As far as we could learn, the natives never penetrate far into
the interior, generally keeping along the shore, and occasionally
cutting across any projecting point of land.</p>
<p>Their food chiefly consists of fish, which they spear very
dexterously. Catching turtle seems to be a favourite occupation
with them, and they appear quite adepts in that useful art. It is
to point the spears, used for that purpose, that they estimate
and covet iron so much. They also make use of shell-fish, which
it is probably the business of the women to collect. They do not
eat the trepang (so desired by Chinese epicures), which is in
great abundance all along the coast; but the various native
esculent roots and fruits, together with cabbage-palms, afford an
agreeable addition to their usual fare.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* They are cleanly in their manners, and, in
some respects, superior to the Europeans,&mdash;fulfilling the
injunction of Moses in the twelfth and thirteenth verses of the
twenty-third chapter of Deuteronomy.]</p>
<p>They are very fond of honey, which appears to be in abundance,
as they were seldom seen in the settlement without a supply of
that article; and when they went into the woods on purpose to
procure it, they soon returned successful. Their mode of
proceeding was, to watch the movements of the bees, (which
requires a keen eye, and long practice,) and as soon as they saw
them settle on a tree, they proceeded to cut it down, which they
effected with their stone hatchets, much quicker than could be
imagined. It was for this purpose that Waterloo ran away with the
axe, "after having seen and tried its use," judging, rightly,
that it was preferable to his own <i>ley-book</i> (<i>i.e.</i>
hatchet).</p>
<p>Respecting the number of the natives, there was no means of
forming anything like a correct opinion; yet, judging from the
rapidity with which they collected, when one of their countrymen
was confined,** it may be conjectured, that they are by no means
thinly spread.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Vide page 76.]</p>
<p>On the occasion alluded to, two natives, who had observed Luga
taken into custody, left the settlement, and spread the tidings.
In the evening, Wooloogary arrived, accompanied by fifty men at
arms. From the time the two natives left, until Wooloogary's
arrival, there was an interval of six hours; they had to walk two
or three miles, and to cross and re-cross a strait two miles
wide. It is difficult to know whether they would have acted
hostilely, had their friend not been released; perhaps they only
came to intercede in his behalf, and, according to the custom of
civilized politicians, thought their request might be better
attended to, by making a formidable appearance.</p>
<p>The only warlike weapons that they used (as far as we could
learn) were spears, of different forms and sizes; the largest are
from nine to ten feet long: some are serrated, and named
<i>burreburai</i>; others are headed with a sharp stone, and
named <i>imburb&#275;</i>. They use the throwing stick, named
<i>rogorook</i>, which is exactly of the same form, and made in
the same manner, as that in use among the natives about Port
Jackson. Besides these, they have small sharp-pointed spears,
which they chiefly use in the spearing of fish.</p>
<p>We could not learn whether they were in the habit of fighting
with each other, or with neighbouring tribes; but spear wounds
being by no means uncommon among them, it is probable that, in
this respect, they also resemble their eastern Australian
brethren. It is well known, however, that they wage continual war
with the Malays, who, it was evident, both hated and feared
them.</p>
<p>It does not appear that the <i>Mar&#275;g&#277;</i> the name
given by the Malays to the natives) are altogether to blame, or,
at least, they may plead in extenuation that, as the
<i>Mulwadie</i> (as they call the Malays) come to their coasts
without leave asked or obtained, and carry away the trepang, and,
more particularly, the much-valued <i>madjendie</i> (<i>i.e.</i>
turtle), it is but fair that they should catch a canoe whenever
they can; and that they are pretty successful in this way,
appeared very evident to us,&mdash;all their canoes being of
Malay construction.</p>
<p>Although it may seem rather paradoxical, yet I do not hesitate
to say, that the natives, far from being such untameable savages
as originally represented, are, in reality, a mild and merciful
race of people. They appeared to be fond of their wives and
children; at least, they talked of them with much apparent
affection. They have frequently interposed their good offices in
preventing the soldiers' children from being chastised: I have
seen them run between the mother and child, and beg the former to
desist from her (as it appeared to them) unnatural conduct, in
punishing her own offspring.</p>
<p>They are, like all uncivilized people, very irascible, but
easily pacified; in short, they require to be managed just like
children. They were easily taught to distinguish conventional
right from wrong, and many instances occurred, which proved their
aptitude in this respect.</p>
<p>Miago, after having become honest himself, once detected one
of his companions endeavouring to secrete a spoon, while they
were about to partake of some rice prepared for
them;*&mdash;provoked by this ungrateful behaviour, he instantly
took it from the delinquent, and sent him away, without
permitting him to have any share of the food.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Captain Barker made it an invariable rule to
give the natives a mess of boiled rice, all his own expense,
whenever they visited the settlement. He strictly prohibited
their receiving any spirits; and, as that article was very
precious, his orders were the more readily complied with.]</p>
<p>On first visiting the settlement, a native would invariably
pilfer anything that came in his way that he could secrete, but
the article was always brought back by those who knew that such
conduct was not tolerated by their civilized visiters.</p>
<p>They also soon learned to place confidence in a person whose
word was to be depended on. Some of our people acted, perhaps, in
rather a reprehensible manner, by promising the natives a
<i>mambrual</i> (or some other present), merely to get rid of
their importunities, without any intention of performing their
promise, thinking the natives would forget the circumstance; but,
in this supposition, they were completely deceived, being
invariably and pertinaciously reminded of their promise, and the
natives looked on them as not to be trusted in future;&mdash;on
the contrary, they placed implicit reliance in those who, having
given a promise, performed it punctually.</p>
<p>The chief objects of their desire were tomahawks, large nails,
and iron hoops; but, in the progress of time, they took a fancy
to various articles of dress. To obtain a shirt, was a great
object with them; and they soon became so particular, that if a
button were wanting in the collar or sleeves, they were not
satisfied till the deficiency was remedied. A coloured
handkerchief, which they used to roll neatly round the head, was
also much prized.</p>
<p>After they became somewhat polished in their manner, if they
saw anything that struck their fancy, they asked for it; if given
them, they shewed no visible marks of thankfulness; and, if
refused them with firmness, they laid it down quietly.</p>
<p>Some time before we left the coast, they could be trusted
implicitly, even with those articles they most highly prized.</p>
<p>It may be justly presumed, that living, as they do, more
agreeably to nature, they are subject to fewer diseases than man
in a civilized state. But, that they are not altogether exempt
from the ills attending animal existence, was very obvious.</p>
<p>"During the inclement and wet weather at the commencement of
this year," observes Dr. Davis, "a party of the Aborigines was
discovered, labouring under acute <i>bronchitis</i>, on a low
neck of land, near the western boundary of Raffles Bay. During
the continuance of the disease (which, in many instances, was
severe,) they were very abstemious. The only remedies which we
saw them employ, during the acute stage, were cords tied very
tightly round their heads, over which they poured cold water.</p>
<p>"On one occasion, the chief (Wellington) lay down on the sand,
and caused one of his tribe to stand on his head,&mdash;most
probably for the purpose of deadening the acute pain he was
suffering.</p>
<p>"Several of these people have deep circular
impressions,&mdash;on their faces in particular,&mdash;as if
caused by the small-pox. From the inability of making myself
understood, the nature of the disease which produced these marks
is not yet ascertained."</p>
<p>The natives described, in language, or, rather, by signs
sufficiently significant, the history of this malady, which they
call <i>oie-boie</i>, and which appears to be very prevalent
among them. It evidently bears a resemblance, both in its
symptoms and consequences, to small-pox,&mdash;being an eruptive
disease, attended with fever, and leaving depressions. It
frequently destroys the eyes, and I observed more than one native
who had thus suffered. Mimaloo's left eye was destroyed by this
disease; hence, his English name, <i>One-eye</i>, to which he
appeared particularly partial. We could not learn whether they
used any remedy, except abstinence.</p>
<p>They are also frequently affected with ophthalmia.</p>
<p>It is a singular circumstance, that the Aboriginal tribes of
New Holland should possess so very little affinity of language,
while in personal figure, manners, mode of life, and implements
of war, there is so striking a resemblance.</p>
<p>The dialect of the natives of Raffles Bay is by no means
inharmonious, but it was extremely difficult to obtain the true
sound of their words, as it frequently happened, that the words
(the correct sound of which not being caught at first) were
repeated by us as near as we could guess, when they, either
through indifference or complaisance, adopted our mode of
pronunciation; and it required some pains, on our part, to
obviate the effects of their apathy or inconvenient
politeness.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** A few words of their language will be found
in the Appendix.]</p>
<p>Whether they have any idea of a Superior Being, or of a future
state of existence, it was impossible for us to ascertain. It was
easy enough to reciprocate communication, as far as regarded
objects evident to the external senses; but, as may be imagined
by those conversant on the subject, any attempt to talk of
abstract principles must have proved altogether fruitless.</p>
<p>When it is called to mind that they were just beginning to lay
aside suspicion, and to visit the settlement without fear, not
long before it was abandoned, it will not seem strange that these
particulars, relating to them, are so scanty and imperfect. A
little longer intercourse would have enabled a person (inclined
to observe their manners, and learn their language) to obtain
more correct and extensive information respecting the various
Aboriginal tribes on this part of the coast, who, to say the
least of it, were treated so cavalierly, in the first instance,
by the civilized intruders on their native land.</p>
<p>Before concluding this brief account of Raffles Bay, I may be
permitted to offer a few general remarks in recapitulation.</p>
<br>
<p>Not long after the formation of this settlement, unfavourable
accounts were sent from it to Sydney, which, being transmitted
home, completely sickened those having the direction of colonial
affairs, who gave orders that it should be abandoned.</p>
<p>Captain Barker (who was in charge when these orders came)
hesitated some time before he decided to obey them. It appeared
evident to him, that the Home Government had acted solely from
the unfavourable information they had hitherto received; and had
they been aware that, at the present moment, the settlement was
in so flourishing a condition, and that there was every reason to
suppose the desired object was on the point of being obtained,
these orders would have been gladly countermanded.</p>
<p>I say, he hesitated some time; but, recollecting that
"obedience is better than sacrifice", he carried the orders into
execution, though with extreme reluctance.</p>
<p>The alleged causes of abandonment were&mdash;1st, The
unhealthiness of the climate;&mdash;2dly, The hostility of the
natives;&mdash;and, 3dly, The non-visitation of the Malays.</p>
<p>Now, from a perusal of the preceding pages, it may appear
sufficiently evident,&mdash;1st, That the climate is not
unhealthy;&mdash;2dly, That the hostility of the natives was
caused, or, at all events, aggravated, by the conduct of the
settlers; and that as soon as conciliatory measures were adopted,
their hostility ceased;***&mdash;3dly, The Malays did visit
Raffles Bay, in considerable numbers; and, had the settlement
continued in existence a few months longer, not only the Malays,
but also many Chinese, chiefly from Batavia, would have migrated
thither.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** In the formation of a settlement on a coast
inhabited by savages, it would be worth while to be rather
liberal of old iron hoops, nails, hatchets, tomahawks, &amp;c.,
inasmuch, as acting in this manner would certainly prevent many
annoyances, and probably save many lives, both of the intruders
and of those intruded on.]</p>
<p>These three causes, therefore, which influenced His Majesty's
ministers to abandon the north coast of New Holland are, I think,
proved to be without foundation; and it is deeply to be deplored,
that these shores should have been thus deserted,&mdash;after so
much expense had been incurred,&mdash;after all the difficulties,
necessarily attending a new settlement, had been overcome, and
pleasing prospects of future prosperity had opened into view.</p>
<p>The principal object in forming a settlement on the north
coast of New Holland has been already mentioned;**** but it is
not altogether the intercourse with the Malays and Chinese that
would render it of such importance,&mdash;there being other
circumstances which would, at least, add to its utility. Ships
proceeding to India, from the colonies on the eastern coast,
would touch there, with obvious reciprocal advantage. Moreover,
it would prove a convenient place of refuge in cases of
shipwreck, which so frequently occur in Torres Straits, and the
adjacent seas.</p>
<p class="foot">[**** Page 123.]</p>
<p>It is, however, hardly worth while to expatiate on the
numerous advantages to be attained by colonizing this part of the
coast, as it is not very likely that the British Government will,
at least for some time to come, make any further attempt; but it
is not improbable that the French or Dutch may be induced to make
a trial; and there can be no doubt that a settlement, judiciously
chosen, and properly conducted, would, in a very short time,
become, both in a mercantile and political point of view, a place
of considerable importance in the eastern world.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><small>Departure from the North Coast of New
Holland&mdash;Buckle's Isle proved not to exist&mdash;The
Governor Phillips strikes on a Coral Rock&mdash;Arrival at
Coupang&mdash;Transactions
there&mdash;Departure&mdash;Savu&mdash;Benjoar&mdash;Arrival at
Swan River&mdash;Freemantle&mdash;Melville Water&mdash;Mount
Eliza&mdash;Perth.</small></p>
<p><small>WE</small> left Port Essington (as already mentioned)
on the morning of the 31st of August, for Coupang, where Captain
Barker purposed to close all accounts that might have been left
unsettled by the late Mr. Radford. He also intended to purchase
provisions for the use of the settlement at King George the
Third's Sound, being fearful that, in consequence of the wreck of
the schooner Mermaid, which was laden with provisions for the use
of that place, it might be suffering some inconvenience.</p>
<p>As it was not out of the course, the Commander of the Governor
Phillips obliged me by steering direct for Buckle's Island. At
eight, <small>P.M.</small>, we were in latitude 10&deg; 58'
south, and longitude 131&deg; 15' east; <i>i.e.</i>, the position
ascribed, on the general chart, to that island; but, although the
evening was clear, we could not discern any appearance of land.
It may, therefore, be safely presumed, that it does not
exist.</p>
<p>We made Timor on Saturday, the 5th of September, and on Sunday
morning, at seven, <small>A.M.</small>, we entered the Straits of
Semao. At half-past ten, the ship struck on a ledge of coral
rocks, and remained there, hard and fast. After various
ineffectual endeavours, we succeeded in getting her off at noon,
and were glad to find that she made no more water than she did
before the accident.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* She was built of teak, and only going about
three knots an hour when she struck.]</p>
<p>At two, <small>P.M.</small>, we arrived at, and anchored off,
Coupang, when Captain Barker and I went on shore, to wait on the
Resident and Secretary. We were informed, that Mr. Hazaart, the
Resident, had proceeded on his expedition into the interior,
accompanied by the Geologist, to search for the gold mines, said
to exist in the mountains;&mdash;and, to repel the anticipated
hostile attacks of the mountaineers,** he was accompanied by
upwards of 1000 men, armed and equipped in the manner already
related.***</p>
<p class="foot">[** The real indigen&aelig; of Timor, who, like
the ancient Britons, retired to the mountains when the parts of
their country of easy access were invaded, and kept possession
of, by more powerful opponents.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Vide page 65.]</p>
<p>The Dutch brig Merkus, in which my friend Captain Young had
proceeded to Batavia, had returned to this port; and I heard,
with regret, that he was dangerously ill at Batavia.****</p>
<p class="foot">[**** On my arrival in England, I heard the
melancholy intelligence, not only of his death, but also of that
of all the other officers, and the greatest part of the crew of
the ill-fated Governor Ready.]</p>
<p>The day after our arrival, the Secretary sent his son to
return our visit, and to invite us to dine, which was the more
willingly accepted, as Captain Barker wished to see whether the
account, which I had given him of the Secretary's epicurean style
of living, had been correct; and he found that my report was not
exaggerated.</p>
<p>We learned, that despatches had been lately received from the
Resident, whose search after the precious metal had hitherto been
unsuccessful, although he had examined all the mines, excepting
one. We hoped that it might not turn out to be a
"dowster-swivilian" business; as the disappointment might have a
fatal effect on the good old Resident, whose only happiness
seemed now to be centred in the success of his expedition.</p>
<p>We met here a Missionary, who had come from one of the small
adjacent islands, for the benefit of medical advice, and change
of air. The disease under which he had long laboured,
intermittent fever, had emaciated him much, but had communicated
additional interest to his mild and intelligent countenance. The
present of a little sulphate of quinine, with directions for its
use, made his hollow eyes sparkle with joy.</p>
<p>He spoke English very intelligibly, having received part of
his evangelical education in London. He had not been particularly
successful in converting the heathens whom he had taken under his
pastoral care; but he had succeeded in softening their manners
considerably, and restraining their accustomed habits of
plundering and murdering those unfortunate beings who might,
either from shipwreck, or by stratagem, fall into their
power.</p>
<p>This, it will be admitted, is doing effectual good. Indeed, it
may be affirmed, that such a rational mode of proceeding is more
likely to be attended with beneficial consequences, than the
endeavour to force down the throats of shrewd heathens abstruse
truths, very difficult to be comprehended, even by the most
enlightened; and far more so, when, from imperfect knowledge of
the language necessary to communicate the desired
ideas,&mdash;admitting that the teacher has a clear perception
thereof in his own mind,&mdash;such subjects must appear to the
uninitiated, more perplexed and obscure.</p>
<p>Captain Barker soon made satisfactory arrangements, relative
to the unsettled commissariat accounts; and he also purchased, at
a fair price, a quantity of salt beef, pork, and flour, for the
use of the settlement of which he was about to take charge.</p>
<p>The brig, in the meantime, completed her water, which was of
excellent quality, and was procured easily, and in abundance,
from a rivulet, (that empties itself into the sea, a little to
the eastward of the Resident's country villa,) the source of
which is in the Secretary's garden, where, from a cool grot, it
gushes forth with vehemence in a copious stream.</p>
<p>During our stay here. Captain Barker and myself made frequent
excursions into the interior in various directions, being
provided, through the kindness of our Coupang friends, with
excellent ponies, which, though not larger than Highland
shelties, carried us easily a considerable distance,
notwithstanding one of us weighed little short of fifteen
stone.</p>
<p>One evening, while taking a ride along the shore to a village
a few miles to the eastward, I observed the long boat (now
converted into a pleasure yacht for the Resident's son) riding
quietly at anchor; and I viewed her with feelings that I hardly
supposed an inanimate object could excite.</p>
<p>We were informed, by the master of the Mercus, that many
Chinese were about to emigrate from Java to Raffles Bay, having
recently learned that they would be permitted to do so. I also
heard from him many anecdotes which he had acquired from personal
observation relative to the mode of conducting affairs at
Melville Island, confirmatory of what had been communicated to me
from several authentic sources.</p>
<p>The total abandonment of the north coast of New Holland caused
much regret to the mercantile people here, as they had
anticipated great advantages from a commercial intercourse.</p>
<p>Captain Barker, anxious to prevent the disappointment and loss
which the Malays would experience by being unacquainted with the
fact, wrote another letter to the Dutch Governor of Macassar,
apprising him thereof, and requesting him to communicate the
intelligence to those whom it might concern.</p>
<p>Da'Atea was left, in charge of Mr. Tielmann, who promised to
take care of him until he found a better situation. This is the
person already mentioned, who ran away from one of the Macassar
proas, and found his way to the settlement at Raffles Bay, and
whom Captain Barker refused to give up, when claimed as a slave;
but whether he acted correctly in this affair&mdash;although
backed by the authority of Moses,*&mdash;may perhaps be
doubted.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Deuteronomy, chap. xxiii. ver. 15.]</p>
<p>This poor fellow, who was much esteemed on account of his good
humour and obliging disposition, usually worked in the garden at
Raffles Bay, where he performed more labour than two or three
convicts, who being sent from home, according to their own
account, for <i>doing nothing</i>, adhere to their favourite
propensity of doing as little as possible elsewhere.</p>
<p>We found that Da'Atea understood very imperfectly the
Malayese, as spoken at Coupang, which, it appears, differs
considerably from the Celebese dialect. He regretted being left
at Coupang; and, had his own wishes been acceded to, he would
willingly have accompanied Captain Barker, at parting with whom
he was exceedingly distressed, following the boat till nearly up
to his neck in water, embracing the Captain's knees, and weeping
bitterly.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the 12th of September, at noon, all affairs being
amicably arranged, we got under way, and bade adieu to the
friendly and hospitable inhabitants of Coupang In order to save,
as much as possible, the salt provisions, for future use. Captain
Barker had purchased as many buffaloes as could be conveniently
carried in the brig.</p>
<p>We were now bound for Swan River; and as that much praised
spot had lately created considerable interest in England, I was
not a little gratified that chance had thrown in my way an
opportunity of paying it a visit.</p>
<p>On Sunday the 13th we were in sight of Savu; and as that and
the neighbouring islands had been, according to Captain Laws,
erroneously laid down by Captain Flinders, we thought it might
not be amiss, as the wind was light, to endeavour to ascertain
whether such was the fact.</p>
<p>From the cross bearings of Savu and Benjoar, the ship's place
at noon by Flinders' chart was latitude 10&deg; 44' 20" S. and
longitude 121&deg; 51' E. Now, the latitude observed by means of
five sets of double altitudes (as the meridian altitude, on
account of the intervention of the land, was not to be confided
in), two being taken in the forenoon, and three in the afternoon,
was 10&deg; 45' 22"; and the longitude, deduced by chronometer,
(the error and rate of which had been correctly ascertained at
Raffles Bay and Coupang,) was 121&deg; 50'; apparent time at ship
known by four sets of altitudes (two, <small>A.M.</small> and
two, <small>P.M.</small>) taken by different individuals, and
easily reduced to noon, the ship having little way through the
water; and in the evening at 7h. 40' by the observed distance
between Jupiter and the moon, carried back to noon by
chronometer, 121&deg; 51' 30". Our position, therefore, it will
appear, was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<!--Table p. 182-->
<table align="center">
<tr>
<td><small>Lat.  </small></td>
<td><small>{ 10&deg; 44' 20" by Flinders.  <br>
{ 10&deg; 45' 22" by us.</small></td>
<td><small>Long  </small></td>
<td><small>{ 121&deg; 51' by Flinders.<br>
{ 121&deg; 50' by our chronometer.<br>
{ 121&deg; 51' 30" by our lunar obs.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>From this it may be presumed, that Captain Flinders has not
erred in the longitude of Savu and Benjoar; and although we had
much respect for the accuracy of Captain Laws, yet, being aware
that he had passed these islands very rapidly, we concluded that
he had rather hastily assigned to them a different position.</p>
<p>During our progress south, which, from light and adverse
winds, was not very rapid, we experienced a westerly current,
running, on an average, half a knot an hour, till we made the
coast of New Holland.</p>
<p>On Sunday, October the 11th, we made the land near Cape Le
Seuer, and noticed that the coast was strewed with coral reefs;
we kept working to windward, the wind blowing from the south,
attended by a heavy swell, and we experienced at the same time a
north-westerly current.</p>
<p>I may here remark, that the buffaloes taken on board at
Coupang throve very well, not one of them having died. This
circumstance was so different from what had always occurred when
Government vessels were sent from the settlements on the north
coast to Coupang for buffaloes, &amp;c., that it became a subject
worthy of observation. The reason, however, was sufficiently
obvious. In this instance proper care was taken of them, and in
the former cases the reverse occurred.</p>
<p>On Friday, October the 16th, we stood in towards land, which
we judged to be to the southward of Buache, intending to pass
between it and the main; but on a nearer approach, the appearance
of the opening not being very inviting, we kept away a little, so
as to pass close to the northern extremity of the island; towards
the evening we descried Rottenest, which presented a singular
appearance, resembling so many pyramids based on the sea.</p>
<p>Just before dark, the ships were descried at anchor nearly
east of us; the sharp-sighted folks were immediately on the
look-out, in order to discover whether the brigs Amity and
Thompson were among the number. We imagined, that our arrival not
taking place until so long after theirs, some unfavourable
surmises might have arisen regarding our safety.</p>
<p>We advanced slowly and cautiously; the lead being strictly
attended to. As we drew near the island, in the apparent fair
channel, the water became suddenly shoal, and the cry of "<i>by
the mark four</i>" was succeeded by "<i>hard a-starboard.</i>" We
kept away north, and after a second and third attempt, equally
checked by shoal-water, it was deemed prudent to stand off under
easy sail until next morning. Fortunately the sea was smooth, and
the southern wind blew very gently.</p>
<p>At daylight, not deeming it advisable to pass to the southward
of Rottenest, we proceeded round the north side of that island,
and passed between it and the main, keeping about mid-channel,
and proceeding on with great care, for which there was much need,
as we could occasionally discern the bottom very plainly.</p>
<p>The appearance of the coast, as we sailed along, was different
from what we had lately been accustomed to; being either
destitute of trees, or very slenderly clothed by patches of
stunted growth. Viewed from where we were, it presented the
aspect of sheep-downs, backed by elevated land, named "the
Darling range", which extends parallel to, and about twenty miles
distant from, the coast.</p>
<p>We were astonished that we could not yet perceive the mouth of
the mighty river, although we were only two or three miles from
the ships, which we imagined were anchored somewhere near it. The
telescope was in much requisition; yet even aided by that useful
instrument, the sharpest eye could not satisfactorily make it
out, the line of coast appearing unbroken.</p>
<p>It surprised us much that Vlaming could have seen it from
Rottenest, at the distance, according to his account, of thirty
miles. We noticed at anchor three ships and one brig (which
looked like the Thompson), and in shore we perceived a dismantled
vessel, which we supposed might be the temporary abode of the
Governor and other public officers.</p>
<p>Full of surmises and conjectures, we arrived at, and anchored
in Gage's Roads, near the other ships; and were shortly
afterwards boarded by a well-dressed and smart-looking gentleman,
who immediately began to rate our poor <i>skipper</i> for not
having hove-to when he perceived him endeavouring to reach the
vessel; but on receiving a soft answer, his wrath began to
subside, and he was pleased to be communicative.</p>
<p>He told us that the Governor resided at Perth, some distance
up the river, where the head-quarters were established; that
another river, named the Murray, had been recently discovered;
that a great number of settlers had already arrived from England,
most of whom yet resided at Freemantle, the sea-port town; that
nineteen ships had entered the roads; that all the land on the
banks of the river was already given away; and that the
dismantled vessel was the Marquis of Anglesey, driven on shore,
having parted from three cables in a N.W. gale; he also pointed
out to us the mouth of the river, and we were greatly
disappointed by its apparent insignificancy.</p>
<p>Captain Barker received an epistle from Dr. Davis, by which he
learned that the Governor declined having any thing to do with
the stores landed from the Thompson and Amity,** accepting only
of the live animals and two buoys.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The Amity had sailed some time ago for King
George's Sound.]</p>
<p>Being informed, that by a boat belonging to H.M.S. Sulphur,
there was daily intercourse to and from Perth, Captain Barker,
anxious to communicate with the Governor, left the vessel with
the intention of proceeding thither; but the boat had departed
some time before he reached the shore. In the evening, Mr.
Hickey, who had remained behind in the brig Thompson, to look
after the stores, came on board, and gave us all the "chit chat"
and "on dits" of this already apparently bustling settlement.</p>
<p>After having taken a walk on shore. Captain Barker returned,
with the intelligence, that the land, which looked well at a
distance, derived its verdant fruitful-like appearance from
innumerable shrubs, and that it was in reality very barren. He
made arrangements for proceeding to Perth next morning in the
brig's boat; and I accepted, very willingly, the expected
invitation to accompany him.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, the 18th of October, after breakfast, we
left the brig, and proceeded on our interesting expedition. The
commander of the brig Thompson, who had come on board to visit
the Commandant, offered (as he was also bound for Perth) to pilot
us up the river, which he said was rather intricate: this
gentleman also procured us the loan of a No. of the Quarterly
Review, containing an article on Swan River. In the boat we were
provided with an azimuth compass, a lead line, the French account
of the river, the Quarterly Review, and various remarks which we
had gleaned from the newspapers.</p>
<p>At 10.45, <small>A.M.</small>, we entered the mouth of the
river, and had soundings&mdash;only half a fathom on the bar;
this was considerably lower than we had anticipated, and not
likely to afford convenient egress or ingress, even for
moderately laden boats. After having passed the bar, we observed
several tents pitched in a low sandy neck of land, which we
understood was the site of Freemantle, so named in compliment to
Captain Freemantle, of H.M.S. Challenger, from the circumstance
of his having taken possession of it, some time before the
arrival of Captain Stirling.</p>
<p>We proceeded up the river, sounding and making other
observations as we went along. Passing the military cantonment,
situated on the left bank, about a mile from Freemantle, we
noticed several straggling huts, apparently belonging to sawyers
and boat-builders. On the right bank, on a picturesque projection
of land, we saw a tent belonging to Captain Curry, R.N., the
harbour-master.</p>
<p>The first view of Melville Water is very pretty. After passing
Mount Eliza, a hill considerably elevated above the adjacent
eminences, we came into view of Perth, situated about a mile
higher up, on the same side of the river, and reckoned about
eleven miles from Freemantle.</p>
<p>We landed at a jetty of considerable length, the water being
very shallow. We found the Governor just on the point of starting
with some friends and attendants on an expedition up the river.
He invited Captain Barker and myself to join the party, but I
declined the honour, having met with an old friend, Lieutenant
Roe, R.N., who filled the situation of Surveyor-General. Captain
Barker proceeded with the Governor; and I remained with my
friend, who informed me, that he was to proceed up the river next
morning, in order to measure the river frontages of land granted
to various emigrants; and I congratulated myself in being able to
take advantage of accompanying him.</p>
<p>At daylight, I arose and took a walk through the
town;&mdash;the intended principal street of which, named St.
George's Terrace,&mdash;where the future beaux and belles of
Western Australia may, in after times, show off their reciprocal
attractive charms&mdash;was, at present, only adorned with lofty
trees, and a variety of lovely flowers.</p>
<p>In my perambulations, I fell in with the <i>written</i>
newspaper of the place, appended to a stately eucalyptus tree,
where, among other public notices, I observed the Governor's
permission for one individual to practise as a notary, another as
a surgeon, and a third as an auctioneer.</p>
<p>There did not appear to be an opposition tree, and so much the
better; as, although a free press may do good to a community
arrived at a certain state of perfection, yet I think it may be
doubted how far it can be serviceable in an incipient colony,
where private affairs are narrowly noticed, and animadverted on:
hence spring jealousies, ill feeling, and their numerous train of
disagreeable attendants.</p>
<p>I noticed another advertisement (not on the public tree),
stating, that Mr. &mdash;&mdash; would supply his friends with
fresh beef at such a price (I think one shilling per pound). The
word <i>friends</i> was scratched out, and the word <i>public</i>
substituted,&mdash;by some person who, doubtless, thought thereby
to check the free and easy manner of the proffered purveyor.</p>
<p>I also met an old shipwrecked companion, the carpenter of the
Governor Ready, who, I learned, had left the Amity, with the
intention of trying his fortune here. As he was an excellent
workman, and very industrious, I had much pleasure in being
instrumental in obtaining for him a convenient location by the
water side.</p>
<p>It struck us with some surprise, that there was not a
clergyman of any denomination here,&mdash;a person holding a
sacred office, if not absolutely necessary, being, at least, of
great utility everywhere, and more particularly in the formation
of a colony. I understood, however, that the Commandant of the
troops read prayers weekly, not only to those under his immediate
controul, but also to all others who chose to attend.</p>

Perth&mdash;Proceed down the River&mdash;Weather-bound at
Freemantle&mdash;Governor's Levee in the open air&mdash;General
Observations regarding the Settlement&mdash;Visit to

<p><small>AFTER</small> an early breakfast, on Monday, the 19th,
Mr. Roe and myself walked to a government farm, situated a little
above "Heirrison's Isles", where we met the boat, which the crew
were obliged to drag over the flats, on account of the
shallowness of the water.</p>
<p>The view to the southward was exceedingly
picturesque,&mdash;equally so as the far-famed scenery of the
lakes of Killarney. This spot is intended for suburban villas,
and appears well adapted for such a purpose.</p>
<p>We entered the boat, and proceeded up the river; the banks of
which, at a short distance above Perth, assumed a most fertile
and verdant aspect. While Mr. Roe stopped, at stated distances,
to mark the trees, I walked smartly, at right angles from the
course of the river, to learn how far the rich alluvial land
extended backwards. It varied from two hundred to twelve hundred
yards. Beyond this, however, the land was, in many places, a rich
red loam, capable of bearing excellent crops.</p>
<p>We stopped at a government farm (where we left our food until
our return, under the charge of Mr. Drummond, the
superintendent), situated opposite to the <i>embouchure</i> of
the Helena river. Having rested, and partaken of some
refreshment, we resumed our course up the river, and I could not
avoid noticing, that the French account of it was exceedingly
correct.</p>
<p>Having advanced within a few miles of the spot where the river
becomes navigable, Mr. Roe finished his professional duty; and
the day drawing to a close, the master's mate in charge of the
boat, who had long been hinting about its being time to return,
on account of the men's dinner (perhaps, also, feeling the stings
of hunger himself), now insisted on doing so, and we accordingly
turned back, and arrived, late in the evening, at the place where
we intended to pass the night.</p>
<p>A convenient shelter was soon erected, to defend us from the
rain; and a large half-burned tree being rekindled opposite the
entrance, soon diffused a genial warmth, and an air of comfort,
well known to those fond of a bush-life. We sat down, with hearty
appetites, to an excellent meal, and enjoyed ourselves much,
laughing heartily at the misfortune that befel the Governor and
his party, who, Mr. Drummond informed us, had lost themselves (or
rather their way) last evening, in endeavouring to reach this
place, and were consequently compelled to remain in the bush all
night, suffering from hunger, and exposed to cold, and heavy
rain.</p>
<p>Next morning, we proceeded down the river, and reached Perth
early in the afternoon. On my arrival there, I was told that
Captain Barker had gone down to Freemantle in the morning; and
although Mr. Roe invited me to remain a day or two, I thought it
more prudent to follow, as speedily as possible, lest I might be
left behind,&mdash;not knowing what arrangements Captain Barker
might have entered into.</p>
<p>I therefore started next morning, Wednesday, the
21st,&mdash;having got a passage in H.M.S. Sulphur's boat; and,
after two hours' sail, I landed at the military cantonment, and
walked into Freemantle, where I learned that nothing had been
done on board the Governor Phillips; there having been no
communication between the shipping and the shore, in consequence
of the blowing weather, and heavy sea.</p>
<p>I sat down on the brow of Arthur's Head, and reperused the
article in the Quarterly Review, and regretted that I could not
agree with the account, that "between the roadstead and the shore
the communication is convenient, and the access easy, as well by
night as by day." While musing on the ways and means to get
something to eat, I observed the Governor coming along, at a
brisk pace, with the intention of going over to Buache, or, as he
has named it, Garden Island; of course he was wind-bound
also.</p>
<p>In a short time, the news having spread that the Governor was
in the camp, he was surrounded by many individuals; and, as I had
never before seen a levee held in the open air, I took up a
favourable position, in order to observe the ceremony. I thought
I could discern, in the Governor's countenance, some annoyance
that he had been thus caught; but being so, he assumed an air of
determination to be as civil and condescending as possible.</p>
<p>Many passengers had arrived by the Atwick, who, it appeared,
were now to be presented. The first was a gigantic,
fierce-looking gentleman, dressed, I suppose, in the newest
London fashion, who had been at some pains with his toilette; and
it was very evident that he considered himself of no small
importance. I thought at first, that he was ill adapted for the
line of life into which he was about to enter; but on further
consideration, I concluded, that if he took as much pains to
cultivate the land, as he appeared to have successfully bestowed
on the culture of his whiskers, he might surpass those less
careful in their attire; especially as his martial frown might
tend to keep his servants in due obedience.</p>
<p>Next came a pert-looking, smartly-dressed gentleman, who
seemed to plume himself on his white kid gloves, neatly-tied
cravat, well-polished boots, and scented white handkerchief. I
thought he would have been more at home, behind the counter of a
fashionable London repository, distributing ribbons and lace to
the fair damsels, than wandering about the wilds of Australia, in
fruitless search of land, abounding in ready-made houses, and
growing corn.</p>
<p>Next came a stout-looking personage, having all the appearance
of a substantial English yeoman, whose jolly features, albeit a
little shrunk from his sea fare, indicated a long acquaintance
with beef and ale. He had not half told his story, when he was
interrupted (contrary to all the rules of etiquette) by the
dapper-looking gentleman, who, doubtless, thought his
conversation more interesting, and agreeable to his Excellency;
but he was, in turn, interrupted by the yeoman, who appeared
determined to have his "say" out.</p>
<p>Then came a modest-looking young man, who presented two
letters to his Excellency, and looked round the surrounding
throng, with an expression of face that seemed to say, "My
fortune is made." He appeared confirmed in this opinion, by a few
civil words from His Excellency, who put the letters in his
pocket, perhaps never to be opened; or, if so, not attended
to,&mdash;the common fate of letters of introduction.</p>
<p>Many more had an interview; the greater part of whom did not
at all appear adapted to undergo the privations and fatigues
necessarily attendant on settling in a new country, even under
the most favourable circumstances.</p>
<p>His Excellency was evidently tired long before the conclusion
of the levee; but, as he could not bow his clients out of the
drawing-room, he was obliged to back astern, which he did, with
much dexterity, until he came to a spot of swampy ground, where
he could not be surrounded, which he jumped over, bowed
courteously to the assembled throng, and walked away, as fast as
decorum would permit, fearful that he might be overtaken before
he reached the boat; which, as soon as he entered, was pulled
with all speed towards Perth.</p>
<p>The Governor's situation was certainly not much to be envied.
All the land on the banks of the Swan, of which these emigrants
had heard such flattering accounts, and of which they naturally
expected to obtain a slice, after having come so far for that
purpose, was already, and, perhaps, improvidently given away.</p>
<p>There is no doubt, therefore, that, although their own
foolishly sanguine expectations might have contributed to blind
them, yet there existed some legitimate cause for grumbling,
which, it is well known, John Bull has a wonderful propensity to
indulge in, frequently <i>ex causis non &aelig;quis</i>;&mdash;It
may not, therefore, be wondered at, if it were rather
unrestrainedly indulged in, as I have every reason to believe it
was, on the present occasion.</p>
<p>Among the number, I observed several faces not unknown to me,
and I was also recognized by them. I went into the tent of Mr.
Lord, formerly a merchant in Calcutta, now supercargo of the
Ephemina, where I received some refreshment, of which I stood in
much need; and shortly afterwards I met another acquaintance, a
respectable settler, from the Derwent, who had brought, amongst
other things, several horses for sale, and he politely
accommodated me with the loan of one.</p>
<p>I rode about twelve miles to the southward, over very uneven
ground, and obtained a good view of Cockburn Sound. The land did
not bear a blade of grass, but was studded with a variety of
beautiful plants.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Having selected several of these I carried
them to Sydney, and presented them to my friend Mr. Cunningham,
who pronounced them all new. Among others, one particularly
struck my fancy&mdash;a splendid red and green
<i>velvetty</i>-looking flower,&mdash;an undescribed
<i>anigozanthus</i>.]</p>
<p>I returned by the beach, and a few miles from the river, I
observed a long boat on the shore, with several things in her,
which, as it afterwards appeared, belonged to the Atwick, having
been blown a-drift from her, by the strength of the wind.</p>
<p>On my return, I received an invitation to the tent of a
settler, where I met several others, who had assembled to spend
the evening. The general topic of conversation was, of course,
relative to land. I ventured to deprecate the idea of giving such
large grants, but was cut short by one of Colonel Latour's
agents, who clearly proved that it was exceedingly advantageous.
I then hinted, that I thought the colony could not get on well
without the aid of convict labour; but here I met with still
greater opposition, as it was universally allowed, that if the
soil were to be polluted with those sort of people,** no
gentleman of respectability would have anything to do with it.
This was, of course, an argument not to be controverted; so I
thought it more prudent to be a listener for the remainder of the
evening. At length, I retired, leaving a portion of the company
busily engaged in endeavouring to overreach each other in petty
barter.</p>
<p class="foot">[** It appeared to me, that many of those I saw,
although belonging to the undetected part of the community, owed
such advantage more to good luck than to their own undeviating
adherence to the moral law.]</p>
<p>Next morning, although it was blowing strongly, I was enabled,
(being favoured with a passage in the Ephemina's long-boat,) to
reach the Governor Phillips, after four hours' hard beating.</p>
<p>I was informed by Captain Barker, that all the stores were to
be re-embarked, which, as nothing had yet been done, on account
of the blowing weather, would occupy some time. I also learned,
that he had obtained the Governor's sanction to leave behind one
of the prisoners, the period of whose sentence had expired a few
weeks ago. This man was a sawyer, and, therefore, a very useful
person.</p>
<p>On Friday, the weather having moderated, the brig's crew were
busily employed in getting off the stores. Captain Barker went on
shore, to superintend operations, and I took a walk of
observation round the nascent seaport town of Freemantle. As all
ceremony is soon waved, I fell into conversation with a
gentleman, busily employed in building a punt; he was not long in
giving me to understand, that he had been a captain in the
army,&mdash;that he had sold out,&mdash;and, as he had, thereby,
lost seven shillings a day, he was now employed in making it up,
as he thought his work equal to that amount. He told me he was a
good musician, and passionately fond of music; and that he was
completely out of his element here. So thought I; yet the
building of a flat-bottomed boat shewed both talent, ingenuity,
and a determination to do some good,&mdash;whereas, the
generality of the others chiefly employed themselves, in smoking
cigars, drinking brandy-and-water, and abusing Mr. Fraser.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** The colonial botanist who accompanied
Captain Stirling from Sydney to Swan River, of which he gave so
flattering an account.]</p>
<p>I observed the greater part of the servants&mdash;sturdy,
idle-looking fellows&mdash;either walking vacantly about, or
standing in groups, apparently hatching mischief.</p>
<p>Before going on board, I assisted Captain Barker to take some
observations, in order to ascertain the variation of the
compass.</p>
<p>Having learned from the master of the Admiral Gifford, who
arrived here yesterday from Coupang, that he had not found less
than three-and-a-half fathoms water in his passage over the reef,
I was anxious to determine the point; and the master of the
Ephemina, seeming to take some interest in the affair, he, and
Mr. Lord the supercargo, agreed to go with me. Accordingly, on
the twenty-fifth, at eight <small>A.M.</small>, we left Gage's
roads in the Ephemina's long boat. I found a very agreeable
addition to the party, in Captain Bannister; and, as I had the
pleasure of the acquaintance of his brother, the late
Attorney-general of New South Wales, and other members of his
family, we soon became on friendly terms.</p>
<p>We stood out towards the passage where we had observed the
schooner to enter, sounding constantly and carefully; and as we
never got less than five, ten, seven, and four fathoms, we were
pleased with the idea of discovering a new passage, but just as
we thought it was all right, we had only two fathoms; we tried
twice or thrice, but got no more; in a short time, in passing
over the ledge, we deepened to five fathoms; the ledge did not
seem more than thirty yards wide; it therefore appeared to us,
that the schooner, which only drew six feet water, passed over
this, which she might easily do unknowingly, between the
different times of heaving the lead.</p>
<p>Although we were not successful in finding the New Channel we
expected, yet we did some good, by showing that a passage did not
exist, as might have been supposed by the safe passage of the
schooner.</p>
<p>We then bore away for Rottenest, where we arrived about three
<small>P.M.</small> in a fine sandy bay, four fathoms deep,
within a few fathoms of the shore, protected from all winds
excepting the south, which seldom blows strong. It was
universally allowed to be a very fit place for a fishing
establishment.</p>
<p>Having landed, we left the boat's crew to kindle a fire, and
make preparations for cooking dinner, which we went in search of,
intending, at the same time, to view the island.</p>
<p>We struck to the westward, and having seen (from an eminence)
what was alleged to be a vessel, stranded on the beach, with her
masts gone, we directed our steps thither, highly pleased with
the discovery: there was a little difference of opinion as to who
saw her first; but, that was not allowed to weigh in the balance,
as, it was supposed, there would be enough for us all.</p>
<p>In going along, however, a question arose how far we might be
justified in taking any thing from her; or indeed whether we
could lay claim even to salvage. These questions and surmises, as
to what vessel it could be, occupied our attention as we went
along,&mdash;a nearer view still confirming us in the truth of
our conjectures.</p>
<p>The vessel appeared to be lying aground at a little distance
from, and with her stem towards, the shore. It was now evident to
us, that she must have parted from her ground tackle, in a gale
of wind, and thus driven on the shore. Captain Bannister and
myself, having left the others far behind, agreed to swim off and
take joint possession of her; and as in doing so we should have
to run some risk from sharks, which are here very numerous and of
great size, we justly considered that we need not be very
particular in taking an exact inventory of her small stores.</p>
<p>It was further agreed, that Captain Bannister should take up
his abode for some time in the vessel, which would afford better
accommodation, and be more secure than his tent at Freemantle,
where he was obliged to walk sentry, in turn with a trusty
servant, every night to guard his property;&mdash;a precaution
absolutely necessary, for, notwithstanding the absence of
convicts, the camp was little better than a den of thieves.</p>
<p>By this time we had approached within about half a mile of our
imagined prize, which now began to assume an appearance that
rather staggered us; and by walking a little farther, we were
sufficiently satisfied that the supposed ship was a small
detached rock, which even now, bore much resemblance to a
dismasted vessel.</p>
<p>Laughing at our disappointment, we bent our way north-east,
until we came to about the centre of the island, where we
observed a salt-water lagoon; and then a south course brought us
to our rendezvous, where we arrived long before our
companions.</p>
<p>The dogs having caught two <i>wallabi</i>, we had them dressed
against their return, which did not take place till the evening
was far spent.</p>
<p>They found much difficulty in getting back, and were evidently
greatly fatigued, and would have preferred their usual bed;
although the sand was soft, the night serene, and the sapphire
canopy beautifully bespangled with glittering stars.</p>
<p>In the morning, as soon as day broke, we went to take another
view of the island, and, at the same time, to procure kangaroos
for our friends; we had not proceeded far from the shore, when
Mr. Lord shot&mdash;not a kangaroo&mdash;but a snake, about five
feet long. He and the others, not seeming to relish this kind of
<i>game</i>, which it was imagined the island abounded in,
thought it advisable to return to the boat immediately; nor could
they be convinced that, with a little caution, there was no
danger to be dreaded.</p>
<p>The foundation of the island Rottenest is of coral, and the
superstructure almost entirely sand; and there is no doubt that
the lagoon is supplied from the salt water percolating
through.</p>
<p>The island is about seven miles long, and from one to two
broad. The hummocks are sand hills, many of which are entirely
destitute of any kind of herbage; in the valleys are some stunted
trees and shrubs, and a very little grass. It appeared
astonishing to us, that Vlaming could speak in raptures of this
island, which we found so miserably barren.</p>
<p>We had much difficulty in getting the boat launched, which the
receding tide had left dry. We then beat out of the bay, and made
the best of our way to Gage's Roads, through a fine opening in
the reef, about four fathoms and a half deep.</p>
<p>Although we had been disappointed, in not finding a good
passage by the way the schooner came in, yet we presumed that our
little cruize had not been unattended with the acquisition of
some useful knowledge, as we had discovered a good anchorage on
the S.E. side of Rottenest, fit for the reception of small
vessels, and altogether a place well adapted for a whaling
establishment; besides, we had shown that a very practicable
passage exists between it and Gage's Roads.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><small>Excursion up the River
Canning&mdash;A Native Village&mdash;Darling Range&mdash;Friendly
interview with the Natives&mdash;Their sudden departure&mdash;We
return to our Encampment on the River.</small></p>
<p><small>AS</small>, under the most favourable circumstances,
the stores could not be re-embarked in less than a week, Captain
Barker and myself projected a cruise up the river Canning, which
had not, as yet, been particularly examined.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the 27th of October, every thing being arranged
for our departure. Captain Barker, Captain Bannister, myself, and
several others, started in the whale-boat, with all the
instruments we could muster, that we might be able to ascertain
the exact position of any remarkable places which we might fall
in with.</p>
<p>In the evening, instead of proceeding to Perth, we bivouacked
at the foot of Mount Eliza, as we were anxious to ascertain its
latitude and longitude; it being in our opinion the place where,
should Perth flourish, an observatory will, in after times, be
formed.</p>
<p>We kindled a fire, and had tea prepared, which, being made
with the water of the river, tasted rather brackish; but it was
sufficiently palatable, when tempered with brandy or schiedam, of
which we partook with moderation; then some retired to rest, and
others passed the night in observing the culmination of several
stars, to ascertain the latitude;&mdash;the sun's meridional
altitude, at this season of the year, being too great to be
measured by the usual means.</p>
<p>Next morning, we started before breakfast, intending to enjoy
it, after we had ascended some distance up the Canning, purposing
to stop at a group of islets, where we expected to meet the
Governor, Surveyor-general, and a numerous train of gentlemen,
who had been invited to accompany them on their present
expedition, which had for its object&mdash;to take an eye survey
of the river, to trace it to its head, and to observe the nature
of the land in its immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>We proceeded slowly, and paid much attention to sounding,
particularly after we entered its mouth, named by the French
"Moreau's Inlet". Having proceeded nearly south for three or four
miles, we perceived that the river's course was from the
eastward.</p>
<p>About ten o'clock we arrived at the appointed rendezvous, and
having landed, we conveyed our cooking and astronomical
instruments on shore, and commenced, without delay, to put them
in use. The water here was quite fresh, so that we enjoyed a
strong cup of tea, which removed the headach, caused by want of
sleep.</p>
<p>We took altitudes of the sun, to ascertain the longitude by
means of the pocket chronometers, and also for double altitudes,
the sun passing too near the zenith to admit of his meridional
altitude being taken. After having waited until the sun's
declining altitude was equal to what we had observed in the
forenoon, we thought it might be as well to proceed up the river,
as there were no signs of the arrival of the Governor or any of
his party, although the time, agreed on for our meeting, was long
past.</p>
<p>We accordingly resumed our way; but our progress was soon
impeded by shallow water, and we were further puzzled as to which
channel (of which there were several) was the best.</p>
<p>A channel being at length selected, chiefly from the recent
track of a boat's keel, which we meant to follow, we were all
obliged to get out, and shove the boat along for some distance,
when the channel contracted to about ten feet wide, and from two
to five feet deep.</p>
<p>Proceeding up this a short distance, we met a boat belonging
to the brig Thompson, and, ere long, discovered her worthy
commander in possession of one of the islets, on which he invited
us to land, with as much courtesy as if he had been in his own
house; we did so, and he showed us its varied advantages with
much satisfaction.</p>
<p>We entered his tent, which was well stored with a profusion of
corn'd beef, cold fowls, Scotch ale, and London porter, and we
partook willingly of his cheerfully proffered
hospitality,&mdash;wishing him and his successors to enjoy
health, prosperity, happiness, and all other blessings that are
usually bestowed, in liberal abundance, on the givers of good
fare.</p>
<p>He informed us, that he had obtained the Government charter to
proceed to Van Dieman's Land for sheep and cattle; that he had
also obtained a grant of 4000 acres of land (of which he was now
in search), and that he intended to settle, with his wife and
children, in the colony.</p>
<p>I was rather surprised at this information, as I knew he had
been among the number of those who abused the
colony,&mdash;predicting that it never would come to any good;
but I learned that his former antipathy arose from his having
been, shortly after his arrival, severely bitten by an uncivil
dog, which had come from Raffles Bay in his own vessel.</p>
<p>Observing that I made no reply to his remark, he asked me,
"What is your opinion. Doctor? don't you think the colony will
succeed?" "Why, it is hard to say: I think the anchorage much
against it: look at the Marquis of Anglesey on shore already!
what may be expected in the winter months?"&mdash;"Oh! the
anchorage is good enough, it was a lubberly trick to let her go
on shore; the colony must succeed; there is nothing can prevent
it."</p>
<p>Such was the change in opinion effected by having obtained the
charter and a grant of land.&mdash;I believe that a similar
change sometimes happens from less convincing arguments.</p>
<p>Learning that we were bound farther up, he accompanied us, and
I promised to render him my assistance, in the selection of his
land. About six o'clock, we arrived at the navigable source of
the river, where we agreed to pass the evening.</p>
<p>We had scarcely got our things on shore when the Governor and
his party came up to us, he was leading the way, apparently,
quite unfatigued; while several of his cortege could just manage,
by their utmost exertions, not to be distanced (a sad thing in
pathless woods); and I have no doubt they heard, with regret, His
Excellency's intention to proceed farther up.</p>
<p>Captain Barker had been invited to be of his party, and of
course joined it here; and off they went at a good round pace;
the boat was to follow with stores and provisions, but whether
well supplied, there was some doubt, the Governor being rather
careless, in the way of provender.</p>
<p>We were also invited to join the train; but although we
considered a monarchical form of government the best, yet we
preferred a republican party of pleasure, and accordingly
remained where we were.</p>
<p>Our fellow-voyager. Captain Hobbs, appeared determined to make
himself comfortable, and, assisted by his boys, soon made, with
his boat's sails, a very snug tent. Two or three boats filled
with respectable emigrants brought up near us; and the place
presented rather an animated appearance.</p>
<p>After having fixed our make-shift observatory, and taken a few
observations, we took a detour to the southward, in order to
observe the nature of the land; and we extended our walk, till
approaching night admonished us to return.</p>
<p>Captain Bannister and Captain Hobbs both determined to fix
their choice here, without farther search, and I advised them by
all means to do so, if they could get the land (which I very much
doubted), as, from its quality and local advantages, I suspected
that it would either be a government reserve, or be given to some
person, having a supposed superior claim to government
indulgence.</p>
<p>On our way home we met two gentlemen. Lieutenant Everard, R.N.
and Mr. Talbot, who, I understood from Captain Barker, had wished
to come from Freemantle in our boat to meet the Governor: but
they had missed their passage, and were consequently obliged to
walk a considerable distance;&mdash;and being fatigued, they had
no wish to proceed in search of the other party;&mdash;preferring
to remain with us.</p>
<p>On the morning at day-light, we renewed our journey; and
experienced considerable difficulty in getting the boat over the
rapids; we then pulled some distance in a deep reach, but our
progress was, from the frequent interruption of fallen trees and
stumps, very slow.</p>
<p>A short distance brought us to other falls, which we also
passed over; but at last recollecting that the boat was made to
carry us, and not we to carry the boat, it was determined to
leave her, and proceed by land.</p>
<p>We looked out for a convenient spot, brought every thing on
shore, and erected an observatory; we then took a slight
breakfast, as we had proposed to have a long day's march, over a
tract of country, hitherto&mdash;as far as we
knew&mdash;unexplored by any European.</p>
<p>About seven <small>A.M.</small> Lieutenant Everard, Captain
Bannister, Mr. Talbot, and myself, started on our pedestrian
expedition; each carrying a bottle of water, and a little bread,
cheese, and brandy; and Captain Bannister had a
fowling-piece.</p>
<p>We pursued a due course east half south, and arrived at the
foot of the Darling Range, having crossed a considerable stream,
and passed over very indifferent land; forming part, I believe,
of Mr. Peel's extensive grant.</p>
<p>We ascended the Range by an easy piss, through which a
considerable stream of water flowed down with rapidity. On
gaining the summit of the first range, we had a very extensive
and beautiful view from the N.W. round to south. The extensive
plots of land, free from trees, appeared to our view quite
verdant and luxuriant, but we knew from experience, that these
apparently fertile spots (chiefly Mr. Peel's) were in reality
very barren.</p>
<p>We continued our course in the same direction through the
mountains, keeping the <i>wimpling-burn</i> on our left.</p>
<p>We suddenly came to a native village, and were startled by the
cries of women and children, who were running from us with all
speed, and the vociferations of men who, were running towards us
with poised spears. Captain Bannister instantly levelled his
fowling-piece, but I requested him not to fire; and, as I thought
I knew more about the natives than he did, I advanced without
fear, feeling assured there was no occasion for
any,&mdash;imagining that no European had been here before
us.</p>
<p>I gave them to understand that we were in search of water,
turning, at the same time, in a direction from their abandoned
village; this pleased them, they laid aside their spears, and
then came and joined us, without hesitation, and led us to the
stream, showing us the water, which they called <i>muga</i>.</p>
<p>These natives were more muscular, and better formed, than
those in the neighbourhood of Port Jackson. We had surprised them
at their toilette; as they were newly painted, their noses
ornamented with the leg bones of the kangaroo, and one of them
had his head decorated with the red feathers of the black
cockatoo.</p>
<p>We walked along the banks of the stream, until we came to the
spot where it divided; one branch coming from the south-east, and
another from the north-east. We halted here a little, and took
some refreshment, in which the natives joined. Lieutenant Everard
taught one of them the song named "Jolly Dick", and he appeared
very apt, pronouncing every word very distinctly, except
"fiddlestick", which he could make no hand of.</p>
<p>They appeared exceedingly quick in imitating our sounds, as
they repeated very distinctly after us (and which was rather
laughable), "Let us keep together in case of treachery;" "They
are not to be trusted", &amp;c.</p>
<p>We learned from them, that there was plenty of <i>muga</i> to
the northward; and, supposing that there might be a lake, whence
the various rivers take their rise, we determined to go in search
of it, and requested them to accompany us, although we were not
without suspicion, that their design was merely to draw us
farther from their dwelling.</p>
<p>We came to a spring, when they called out, "<i>Muga,
Muga</i>;" we drank a little, and gave them to understand that we
wanted to go where there was a greater collection of it. We
accordingly kept advancing: at the same time, it was observed,
that they were deviating from a straight course; but a short
distance brought us to a fine stream, running north-west, which
we supposed emptied itself into the Swan: we still called out
<i>muga, muga</i>, and proceeded on, until we came to their place
of hunting, which, as they described to us, abounded in
kangaroos.</p>
<p>They distinctly pronounced "kangaroo", without having heard
any of us utter that sound; they also called it <i>waroo</i>, but
whether they distinguished "kangaroo" (so called by us, and also
by them,) from the smaller kind, named "<i>wallabi</i>", and by
them "<i>waroo</i>", we could not form any just conclusion.</p>
<p>One of them, who appeared to be superior to the others, both
in rank and intelligence, shewed us various roots which they used
for food, and also the manner of digging for them; and, in return
for our civility, in giving him and his friends a little biscuit,
he procured a handful of loathsome-looking grubs from a grass
tree, and offered them to us, after having himself ate two or
three, to show us that they were used by them as food. His polite
offer being courteously declined, he snapped them up, one by one,
smacking his lips, to show us that what we had refused was
esteemed, by him, as a "<i>bonne bouche</i>."</p>
<p>We continued advancing for some time, but saw no indications
of a great lake, which we fancied existed somewhere near; and the
natives began to lag behind, allowing us to proceed as we
pleased. One of them was requested to lead the way, as directly
as possible, to the water. He did so; and, after going a short
distance, we came to another spring of pure water. He desired us
to go through the <i>brush</i>, and examine it; although there
was nothing to be learned from such a close scrutiny, to please
him, we complied with the request, and, on turning round, the
natives had disappeared!</p>
<p>The cry of "treachery" immediately arose from some of our
party, who supposed that they had either led us into a convenient
place, where they could spear us with facility, or, had gone for
more assistance, to cut off our return.</p>
<p>But these were false alarms. Their conduct, which, at the
moment, surprised us, might very easily be accounted for, without
suspecting any hostility or masked treachery towards us. We had
come upon them unawares, and our interview had been
friendly,&mdash;we asked them to show us water, which request
they complied with again and again; until, being tired out, with
walking so fast, and so far, they contrived this mode of making
their escape, as our desire for <i>muga</i>, I dare say, appeared
to them, unquenchable.</p>
<p>We then retraced our steps in a direct line to the principal
stream,* which we were enabled to do, by having had an eye,
either on the compass or on the sun, while going along with the
natives.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The source of the Helena, a considerable
stream tributary to the Swan.]</p>
<p>It being now some time after noon, we agreed to halt a little,
and take our repast, which we did with much pleasure, sitting on
the bank, with our feet in the cool, limpid, rapid stream.</p>
<p>It was now proposed, that we should proceed another day on
discovery, directly east, to endeavour to see what kind of
country there was to the eastward of the mountains; but this
proposal, not being relished by the majority, was, after some
discussion, abandoned.</p>
<p>Having rested an hour, we proceeded south-east, to gain the
highest part of the hill, being anxious to obtain even a
pisgah-view of the eastern land; but when we got there, we could
see to no extent, on account of the thickness of the wood.</p>
<p>We then continued our journey, directly south, to avoid going
near the native village, knowing that the natives (who were, no
doubt, strictly watching all our movements) would be pleased, by
our not indulging in too much curiosity. In fact, the best method
of making them familiar is, to pretend not to care much about
them.</p>
<p>We passed another village, apparently deserted: these
habitations, resembling a beehive cut vertically in halves, are
formed from the stems of the grass tree, stuck in the ground, and
joined at the top, with the leaves and boughs interwoven.</p>
<p>After walking some distance south, we struck to the westward,
and pursued our way to our rendezvous, where we arrived about
eight o'clock, and partook of a savoury meal, which had been
prepared for us.</p>
<p>Being somewhat fatigued by a twelve hours' rather sharp march,
over an uneven country, we soon retired to sleep, except the
individual who had to watch the stars,&mdash;in order to
ascertain the exact latitude of the river at this place.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><small>Return down the River&mdash;Excursion
to Garden Island&mdash;Description of the Swan and Canning
Rivers&mdash;Perth&mdash;Freemantle&mdash;Remarks&mdash;Geographical
position of Arthur's Head.</small></p>
<p><small>NEXT</small> morning, as we were on the point of
proceeding down the river, we were overtaken by the Governor, and
some of his party, who had bivouacked last evening about half a
mile above us. The Governor and Lieutenant Roe seemed rather
astonished, when informed that our present position was, from
observations that were to be depended on, to the northward of the
estuary of the Swan.</p>
<p>Captain Barker now joined us, and from him I learned, that
they had followed the principal branch of the Canning, until it
entered the mountains,&mdash;that the land on its banks was very
tolerable, and, in some places, rich; but not to be compared with
that on the banks of the Swan. He also informed me, that he had
seen two graves, which, from a spear being fixed on one, and a
piece of kangaroo skin on the other, he supposed belonged to a
male and a female.</p>
<p>We all proceeded down together, until we arrived at the
island, when we took different channels,&mdash;we preferring our
old one. We experienced, however, far greater difficulty in
getting the boat over, as the sand was now uncovered in various
places.</p>
<p>After much fruitless toil, we were compelled to carry
everything from the boat to a dry sand-bank; then, by main force,
we dragged her into deep water, and reloaded her.</p>
<p>We stopped here to refresh, and to take more observations;
which, being finished, we proceeded down the river, and a little
before dark, arrived at the foot of Mount Eliza.</p>
<p>As we had experienced some inconvenience when we last halted
here, from not being able to observe the stars to the northward,
we determined to ascend the hill; but this was objected to by
some, who felt neither interest nor amusement in such pursuits,
and who would much sooner have gone to Perth.</p>
<p>Captain Barker and myself, however, ascended, and were
followed by all the others. We got a fire kindled, and everything
up; when some commenced to cook supper, and others to observe the
moon's distance from the evening star.</p>
<p>The black swan which we had run down (after several
unsuccessful attempts to shoot it) in Moreau's inlet. although
rather tough, was considered a dainty. After supper, we retired
to rest,&mdash;those excepted whose task it was to observe the
stars.</p>
<p>Although frequently baffled by the annoying intervention of
clouds, we succeeded in obtaining the meridian altitude of
several, which gave the latitude 31&deg; 57' 48" south.</p>
<p>Next morning, early, we moved our camp, and, in descending the
hill, found a fine stream of pure water, which we regretted had
not been discovered earlier, as we should not have been under the
necessity of using the water of the river, which, from being
brackish, was not very palatable.</p>
<p>We proceeded down the river, and stopped at the spot, where
Captain Stirling says "a communication might easily be formed
between the river and the sea." All the party left the boat, to
examine whether Captain Stirling's account was correct,&mdash;one
excepted, who had no desire for that kind of knowledge, only to
be obtained by personal, and more particularly by pedestrian,
exertion.</p>
<p>On our return to the boat, he showed us a specimen of pretty
pure salt; a rock of which he had discovered just above the spot
where the boat remained in waiting for us. In this instance,
therefore, a want of curiosity was attended with some
advantage.</p>
<p>Having landed our fellow-explorers at Freemantle, Captain
Barker and myself proceeded directly to the brig (found five feet
water on the bar), where we arrived all well, and highly
gratified with our little excursion. We immediately projected
another expedition to visit the newly-discovered river, named the
Murray; but were prevented from putting it into execution, by the
variable and stormy state of the weather.</p>
<p>On Friday, the 12th of November, Captain Telfer, of the
Ephemina, Mr. Hickey, and myself, took a trip to Buache, or
Garden Island. Before landing, we paid a visit to H.M.S. Sulphur,
and were received by Captain Dance and his officers with
courteous cordiality; and from the first lieutenant (Mr. Preston,
formerly of the Success, who is an enterprising and indefatigable
explorer) I learned many facts, corroborative of those I had
already heard, relative to Melville Island and Raffles Bay.</p>
<p>On leaving the Sulphur, we pulled to the southward. Arriving
nearly at the southern extremity of the Island, we landed,
intending to penetrate across it; but, from the thickly
interwoven underwood, our progress being painful and slow, the
attempt was abandoned.</p>
<p>We returned, and walked along the shore. On our arrival at the
southern extremity of the island, we observed that it was
separated from the main land by a channel, about half a mile
wide; and there appeared to be, from the colour of the water,
considerable depth on the southern side. From general
appearances, however, and from the extensive reefs observed to
seaward, this opening can only be considered a practicable
passage for boats, during moderate weather.</p>
<p>While walking round the south-west side of the islands, we
perceived a seal making for the shore; he waddled some distance
up the sandy beach, and, after looking around, lay down at his
ease, intending, no doubt, to enjoy repose.</p>
<p>Anxious to catch this fellow napping (if we could), we walked
very gently and cautiously towards him; but having caught the
alarm, before we were sufficiently near, he started up, hastened
to the water, dived into it, swam some distance, and then turned
round, and surveyed us with composed defiance, as much as to say,
"follow me, if you dare;" but we did not think fit to accept the
invitation.</p>
<p>We then retraced our steps to the place where we had left the
boat, and proceeded in her to visit the establishment on Garden
Island. It was also our intention to examine the passages from
Cockburn Sound to seaward, but the day being too far spent to put
this design into execution, we directed our course for Gage's
Roads, where we arrived at eight, <small>A.M.</small></p>
<p>The stores being all re-embarked, and everything ready for
departure. Captain Barker went to Perth, to get receipts for the
articles he had left behind, and also to bid adieu to the
Governor; and I embraced the opportunity of accompanying him.</p>
<p>We found a considerable number of natives in the town, who
were apparently peaceably inclined, though quite at their ease.
Lieutenant Roe could not endure the sight of them; recollecting,
I imagine, the uncivil chase their brethren, of the north coast,
had given him, some years ago.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Vide King's Australia.]</p>
<p>The Governor was not in very good health, in consequence, I
believe, of over fatigue; caused by a wish to excel all others,
in pedestrian feats, and in endurance of wet, cold, hunger, and
thirst.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** I have no doubt his present indisposition
will admonish him, that when, in future, he comes to a swamp, it
will be preferable to take a detour, instead of passing directly
across it. The change would also be highly agreeable to his
followers, who consider themselves bound to follow their chiefs
track, frequently up to the middle, in water and mud.]</p>
<p>We remained all night at Perth, and next morning took our
farewell; and, after a pleasant sail down the river, reached the
brig, which, being ready for sea, was waiting our arrival.</p>
<br>
<p>During our detention here, I availed myself of every
opportunity of acquiring a knowledge of the adjacent country,
from personal observation; and, although the information obtained
was neither extensive nor very important, yet I may indulge in a
few general observations, more particularly as the published
accounts are so discrepant and contradictory.</p>
<p>The river named Black Swan, by Vlaming, from its being
frequented by a great number of these <i>rar&aelig; aves</i>,
arises from the Darling Range, and pursues a south-westerly
course, through a tract of level country (rich and luxuriant on
the banks of the river), without receiving any considerable
contribution to its stream: it is navigable for boats a few miles
from its source.</p>
<p>About twelve miles above Perth, opposite Guildford, (a town
that is to be,) it receives a considerable accession by the
waters of the Helena; and shortly afterwards, it receives two
other tributary streams, whose source and direction are not yet
accurately ascertained.</p>
<p>A little above Perth, the navigation is much impeded, by the
shallowness of the water, and a cluster of islands, named by the
French "Heirisson's Isles".</p>
<p>At Perth, the river expands, and deepens considerably; and
being joined by the River Canning (the junction taking place
nearly south from Mount Eliza), the united waters have been named
by Captain Stirling "Melville Water".</p>
<p>The triple source of the Canning is also from the Darling
Range,&mdash;one branch traced by the Governor's party, another
by us, and the third not yet surveyed.</p>
<p>The united streams become navigable, for boats, about six
miles from the mountains.* Pursuing a westerly course for several
miles, the river becomes deeper, but navigable only for small
craft.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Latitude, 32&deg; 2' 32" south; longitude,
116&deg; 14' 35" east.]</p>
<p>As the navigation of the Swan is impeded by islets, so is the
Canning by a similar cluster.** Passing this obstruction, the
river still flows in a westerly direction (its banks becoming
higher, and the adjacent land more barren), the channel being
unimpeded: it then bends to the northward, and, after a course of
three or four miles, joins the Swan, as already mentioned.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Latitude, 32&deg; 00' 58" south; longitude,
116&deg; 11' 30" east.]</p>
<p>The united rivers (whose banks are now miserably sterile)
pursue a serpentine course, inclining withal to the southward,
till they fall into the sea by a channel 330 yards wide; only
one-fifth of that width, however, affording sufficient depth even
for the passage of a small boat.</p>
<p>The channel is rather intricate; but the deep water is chiefly
on the right bank, and, to say the least of it, boats heavily
laden, or small craft, may be used, without much risk, between
Perth and Freemantle.</p>
<p>The length of the Swan, in a direct line, is about thirty
miles, and of the Canning, twenty miles: taking, however, their
various windings into account, the distance may be doubled.</p>
<p>This account certainly does not agree with some others,
especially the one which states "that vessels of large burden are
enabled to sail seventy miles from its entrance."</p>
<p>Perth, the embryo capital of Western Australia, situated on
the right bank of the river, about twelve miles from the sea,
has, as yet, only the appearance of a straggling tented field;
but I have no doubt its aspect will, in a short time, be very
different. The Governor has got a commodious wooden house nearly
finished, and the government officers were commencing to follow
his example.</p>
<p>It seemed to Captain Barker and myself, that the situation of
the town was not judiciously chosen. Point Heathcote, on the
western bank of the Canning, nearly at its junction with the
Swan, according to our opinion, would have been, in many
respects, preferable.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** After my arrival in England, I learned (from
high authority) that Point Heathcote had been originally proposed
as the best place, in a geographical point of view, for the site
of the town.]</p>
<p>Freemantle, the seaport town, is situated on a low sandy
point, at the mouth, and on the left side, of the river. At
present, the inhabitants live in tents: there are, however, a few
wooden houses, which have been brought from England.</p>
<p>The greater part of the settlers yet remain here, not one
having gone to his farm. It is a very bad place, owing to the
idleness, roguery, and thieving of those people brought out as
servants, and also of some others of a higher denomination. It is
so bad that the Governor designated it a "sink of iniquity", and
stated that he took no measures to make it better, on purpose to
force people to go to their farms.</p>
<p>The servants are, for the most part, hulking, lazy fellows,
and exceedingly insolent; but what else could be expected, from
their previous character, having been, I believe, mostly taken
from the workhouse.</p>
<p>Mr. Talbot, who, like his neighbours, had had some trouble
with his servants, informed me that those who had the best
character from the overseers, turned out to be the worst. "It is
true (said he) an action may be brought against an overseer, for
having given a false character; but, then, who would go home with
all the necessary witnesses to England, to prove the fact?" He
further good-humouredly observed, that "nothing else could be
expected, than that overseers should endeavour to get their
parishes cleared from such <i>trash</i> and <i>scum.</i>"</p>
<p>It is a very injudicious plan to send people, accustomed to
eat the bread of idleness, to an infant colony, unless it is
understood, that coercive measures may be used to enforce a fair
day's work, if the laziness of the individual required such
stimulus.</p>
<p>All the land, on the immediate banks of the Swan, is allotted
away. One individual, I was informed, has got 15,000 acres of
excellent land, and is now residing at Freemantle, selling those
articles, from which he claimed and received such an extensive
grant; and it was the opinion of not a few, that the Governor had
acted very improvidently, in giving such an extent of river
frontage to one individual.</p>
<p>It would, perhaps, have been better, to have made a square
mile the maximum of any grant on a river; this would have
accommodated many emigrants, who could by degrees, and at their
convenience, go into the interior, to search for the
remainder.</p>
<p>Much disappointment has already been felt by many, who, from
the favourable report they had heard in England, expected to be
immediately inducted into a land, if not "flowing&mdash;easily
capable of being made to flow&mdash;with milk and honey."</p>
<p>On their arrival, they find all the land, of which they had
heard so much, already disposed of, and that they must discover
good land for themselves, if they can.</p>
<p>Much obloquy has been thrown on Mr. Fraser, in consequence of
his (as it is called) exaggerated description. Now, the truth is,
that he has given a very fair account, but it extends no farther
than the immediate vicinity of the river; and the land there (as
already mentioned) has been all granted away,&mdash;each of the
Officers of H.M.S. Sulphur having a fair proportion.</p>
<p>Nearly the whole of the land on the banks of the Canning was
also pre-engaged,&mdash;the Officers of the Challenger having, as
they had a right to expect, received a similar indulgence; but
the justice of this proceeding was called in question, by many
emigrants who were on the spot, in just expectation of obtaining
the object for which they had left their native home.</p>
<p>The civil officers also considered themselves labouring under
grievances, particularly by not receiving either candles or oil;
it being imagined that they would not want any, from the
abundance of whales on the coast; but whales are not taken
without considerable exertion and outlay.</p>
<p>Several of my acquaintances proposed to the Governor to
commence a fishery on a great scale, if they were
allowed&mdash;Rottenest, Buache, and the exclusive right to a
considerable part of the coast, with other immunities, for
fourteen years. The Governor very handsomely offered them a lease
of seven years; but they did not consider these terms
advantageous enough, and the speculation dropped.</p>
<p>Besides Perth and Freemantle, there is a station at Garden
Island, where the stores are kept. The government have also
hired, as a dep&ocirc;t for stores, the stranded ship Marquis of
Anglesey, for a hundred pounds per annum, from an individual who
purchased her for a hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
<p>There were several government regulations which, as is usual
in all new colonies, did not meet universal approbation; but,
without entering into any discussion on this subject, I may
mention, that the exaction of pilotage and harbour
dues,&mdash;there being no pilots,&mdash;appeared rather
premature.</p>
<p>I shall conclude this brief account of Swan River, by stating
the geographical position of Arthur's Head,* according to our
observations:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* The peninsular projecting eminence of the left
bank of the river, at its <i>embouchure</i>.]</p>
<p class="sindent" align="center">
<small>                        Latitude 32&deg; 4' 13" S.<br>
                    Longitude 116&deg; 1' 46" E.<br>
Variation of Compass 4&deg; 16' 45" E.</small></p>
<p>As this longitude is more than twenty miles farther east than
that given by Captain Stirling, it may be worth while to state,
that we took upwards of two hundred lunar observations,** with
carefully adjusted sextants, and it may therefore be fairly

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><small>Departure from Swan
River&mdash;Unsuccessful attempt to land at Cape
Chatham&mdash;Boat nearly Swamped&mdash;Heavy Gale&mdash;Leaky
state of the Brig&mdash;Anchor in King George's
Sound&mdash;Excursion into the Interior&mdash;Interview with a
Native.</small></p>
<p><small>ON</small> Thursday, November 19th, we got under weigh,
and left Gage's Roads, passing between Rottenest and the Main. At
noon our observed latitude was 32&deg; 00' 50", at which time we
were a full mile to the northward of the reef off the western
point of Rottenest, situated West 16&deg; north of Arthur's head,
distant about twelve English miles, by which bearing it would be
in 32&deg; 2' 13", so nearly coinciding with the latitude by
observation, and agreeing with that assigned long ago by
Vlaming,* that it may be considered pretty correct.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In the latest edition of Horsburgh's
directions, he has still given the longitude according to the
Dutch account, which places the Island ten leagues off shore, and
states it to be fifteen miles in length.]</p>
<p>We intended to keep close to the shore, to have a view of the
coast between Geographe Bay and Cape Leuwin, but the wind would
not permit us. We also experienced a north-westerly current,
running, at an average, one mile per hour.</p>
<p>After having reached the parallel of Cape Leuwin, we could
make but little way to the eastward, owing to the wind blowing
strongly from the S.E. On the 28th, in the morning, the wind
having shifted to W.S.W., we made Point D'Entrecasteaux; and
coasting along, we shortly saw Cape Chatham, which, at noon, bore
E. by N., distant about half a mile; and, by the supplement of
the sun's meridional altitude ** our latitude was 35&deg; 3' 26"
&mdash;longitude, by chronometer, measured from Swan River
116&deg; 41'.</p>
<p class="foot">[** "There is", observes Mr. Lynn, "a great
convenience in the sextant, which is not generally known; and, if
known, rarely taken advantage of; viz., that of observing the
supplement of the meridional altitude when the land is too near,
or in that portion of the meridian which prevents the direct
meridional altitude from being observed."]</p>
<p>This being the place that Captain Barker was requested by
Captain Stirling to examine, (as, according to the description of
several sealers, a large river or inlet existed hereabouts,) the
brig stood close in; nothing, however, could be perceived,
bearing any resemblance, nor did it seem probable, from the
appearance of the land, that any inlet or river could exist in
this position.</p>
<p>Captain Barker and I had previously agreed to go on shore, in
order to explore; but, being now quite convinced of the inutility
of such a proceeding, I begged to decline, and advised him not to
think of going; more particularly as the weather (although fine
at present) was very unsettled.</p>
<p>He would not, however, be dissuaded from his purpose; and the
boat being hoisted out and manned, she left the brig, which, by
this time, had advanced some distance into the bay. We then wore,
and stood to the southward.</p>
<p>The boat had not left half an hour, when the wind increased;
and the heavy squalls shifting more to the southward, made our
situation not at all desirable. It had been agreed, that, should
the weather assume a threatening aspect, a gun was to be fired,
as a signal for the boat to return. This was accordingly done,
and we again stood towards the shore; but we could see no
appearance of the boat, and serious apprehensions began to be
entertained, that she would not be able to regain the brig.</p>
<p>We approached much nearer than prudence suggested; yet, had we
not done so, the boat could never have reached us; as she could
not have made any way against the heavy swell that was tumbling
in, round the frowning, barren, isolated rock, which forms Cape
Chatham.</p>
<p>We had, at length, the satisfaction of seeing the boat
returning, and stood towards her, until the rapidly decreasing
depth of water, and heavy breakers under our lee, admonished us
to proceed no farther; we therefore wore (having just room to do
so), and then lay-to, until the boat reached us. Having presented
to each individual a glass of brandy, to counteract the effects
of the cold and wet, I learned the history of their expedition,
which was as follows.</p>
<p>As they drew near the shore, the rollers appeared very heavy.
The first one rolled over, and filled the boat; and had not the
crew (who, being old sealers or whalers, were adroit in the
management of a boat under such circumstances) exerted their
utmost skill and efforts to get her head round before the next
roller came, they would have been pitched into the surf, without
ceremony. This narrow escape made them give up all thoughts of
landings as, even had they succeeded, it would have been
impossible to get off, again.</p>
<p>Captain Barker wished to proceed towards the north-east side
of the bay, where there appeared to be less surf; but, on its
being represented to him, that if he did so, the boat would not
be able to reach the brig, they pulled towards her, and arrived
safely, but nearly exhausted by fatigue.</p>
<p>We now stood out to sea, and with difficulty cleared some
reefs, on which the water was boiling, under our lee. Captain
Barker still thought he saw something like an opening to the
north-east; but although I looked very carefully, I could not
perceive any appearance of an inlet. Allowing, however, that such
an opening did exist, it could be of no use, as this bay, being
completely exposed, from S.W. to S.E., can never be safe for
ships, even of the smallest size.</p>
<p>We continued our course, keeping as far off the land as we
could,&mdash;the wind threatening to blow a gale from the
southward. At eight, <small>P.M.</small>, we lay-to, with the
ship's head S.S.E.; at two, <small>A.M.</small>, wore and lay-to
W. by N., and at daylight we bore up; but, from the extreme
haziness of the weather, we could not satisfactorily make out the
land. After some time, however. Eclipse Islands were plainly
distinguished.</p>
<p>We continued under close reefed maintop-sail, and about noon
entered King George's Sound; where, from a heavy gale, and high
sea, we experienced the sudden but agreeable transition to smooth
water.</p>
<p>I have seldom passed a more disagreeable day than the last
twenty-four hours; dreading that the wind might shift to the
southward. Fortunately, it kept S.W., but blew a heavy gale. The
brig was making much water, and the pumps were in very bad order.
In the middle of the night, during the height of the gale, the
pumps would not work: this alarmed some of the crew, but the
master of the brig, with great coolness, gave directions, and put
the pumps in order himself.</p>
<p>About noon, on Sunday, the 29th of November, we anchored in
King George's Sound, within a mile of the entrance of Princess
Royal harbour. Shortly afterwards, we were boarded by a boat from
the settlement, by which we learned that the Amity had sailed for
Sydney, that the schooner Admiral Gifford had arrived a month
ago, and that great fears had been entertained regarding our
safety.</p>
<p>Next morning, the brig got under weigh, but grounded in the
entrance of Princess Royal Harbour, and remained there the
greatest part of the day. Lieutenant Sleeman came on board, early
in the morning, to welcome his successor, and Captain Barker and
I went on shore to breakfast with him.</p>
<p>The settlement was very healthy, not so short of provisions as
we had imagined, and they had an abundance of vegetables. After
breakfast, I took a walk with Dr. Davis, to view the Government
Farm, situated about a mile or two from Frederic Town (so named
by Major Lockyer), to which a very good road had been made.</p>
<p>On our return, we walked to the summit of Mount Melville,
whence we had a very extensive view of the surrounding country,
which bore a decided resemblance to the land about the Cape of
Good Hope, when viewed from the top of Table Mountain.</p>
<p>A range of mountains extended from the north-west to
north-east, about the same distance from Mount Melville as the
Hottentot mountains are from Table Mountain. Another tier was
observed to the westward, evidently the coast range; between
these, there appeared to be level land, and thither I determined
to make an excursion, during the time the brig remained in
harbour; as I had been informed by the Commander that eight or
ten days would be required to caulk her, and make the other
repairs absolutely necessary, before she proceeded on her
voyage.</p>
<p>While returning down, we met Captain Barker and Lieutenant
Sleeman, on their way to the farm. On making known my intention
to take a little trip into the interior, Lieutenant Sleeman (who
had not yet resigned command) offered me the assistance of any
Crown prisoners I might wish, to carry provisions, &amp;c., and
also an intelligent native, named Mok&#259;r&#275; (who was now
out shooting ducks for dinner): this I willingly accepted; and,
on my reaching the camp, made arrangements for starting on
Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>We dined with Lieutenant Sleeman. Wild ducks and green peas
were highly relished by us, after living so long on salt
provisions. We were glad to hear from him that the natives were
exceedingly friendly; no act of hostility having been committed,
either by or against them, since his arrival.</p>
<p>I suspected that this circumstance must have been occasioned
by judicious management in the first instance; and, on making
inquiries, I discovered, in an old order book, the following
order of Major Lockyer, which, from its being attended with such
favourable results, deserves to be known and imitated by those
who may hereafter be placed in the same responsible
situations.</p>
<p align="right"><small>"Camp.&mdash;Princess Royal Harbour, King
George<br>
the Third's Sound.&mdash;January, 1827.      </small></p>
<blockquote>"The natives having, without any offence been offered
to them by any individual of the expedition, committed an act of
hostility, by watching an opportunity, and throwing their spears
on a party employed filling water-casks for the brig, and by
which one of the prisoners of the Crown, Dennis Dinneen, was most
severely wounded, is a circumstance most sincerely to be
regretted; as it is but too certain that they have been driven to
it, by acts of cruelty committed on them by some gang or gangs of
sealers, who have lately visited this place.<br>
<br>
"The fact of these miscreants having left; four natives on
Michaelmas Island, who must have inevitably perished, if they had
not been taken off by the boat sent from the Amity, that brought
them to this harbour, when one of them exhibited three deep scars
on his neck and back, that had been inflicted by some sharp
instrument, sufficiently proves that they have suffered injuries
from white men; and it is not to be wondered at, that they
should, as people in a state of nature, seek revenge; it is,
therefore, necessary to act with the greatest caution and
vigilance to prevent surprise on individuals straggling, and the
parties employed in the bush, in cutting down wood for the use of
the settlement.<br>
<br>
"It is not probable that they will make their appearance again
for a considerable time. Should they, however, be seen, immediate
notice is to be given to the Commandant; but no act of hostility
is to be committed by any one of the settlement, unless it is
absolutely necessary to repel such committed by the natives.<br>
<br>
"In case of their being armed with their spears, they must be
prevented from approaching the encampment; if unarmed, it is
desirable that a communication should be opened with them, and
every endeavour used to satisfy them that we do not intend to
molest them in any shape, but, on the contrary, to be their
friends; and also to convince them, that the ill usage they have
received, from the unprincipled persons, is reprobated, and will
not be permitted to occur again.</blockquote>
<p align="right">"E. LOCKYER,                    <br>
<br>
<small>Major, 57th Regiment,     <br>
<br>
<small>COMMANDANT."</small></small>   </p>
<br>
<p>Mok&#259;r&#275; expressed much willingness to accompany me,
and I was further gratified by Mr. Kent, the officer in charge of
the Commissariat, expressing a wish to join the party. A soldier,
of the thirty-ninth, named Gough, who was esteemed a good
bushman, volunteered, as did also two prisoners of the Crown; one
of whom had accompanied Mr. Baxter on all his botanical
excursions, and the other had attended the former expeditions
made by Major Lockyer, Captain Wakefield, and Mr. Tollemache.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, while we were preparing for our excursion, I was
advised, by the master of the Admiral Gifford, not to trust the
blacks, who were (he said) a set of treacherous villains; as, not
long ago, they had pointed their spears at him and his boat's
crew, while peaceably proceeding up King's River.</p>
<p>But such expeditions being generally for the purpose of
surprising and carrying off the native women, it cannot at all be
wondered at, that the native men should endeavour to prevent the
outrage. Indeed, it is quite notorious on many parts of the
coast, that if a small vessel makes her appearance, the natives
get out of the way as fast as possible; while, if the ship be
large, they come down to the beach, without mistrust or fear.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, at daylight, we left the settlement,
with a week's provisions. Gough had his knapsack filled with
brandy, rum, and gin; and, although rather heavily burdened, he
made no objection. from the nature of his lading. The only burden
of Mok&#259;r&#275; was a fowling-piece, which he would not go
without; and, as he was a good shot, we thought he might be of
use, in procuring fresh provisions. Gough had a musket, and Mr.
Kent a fowling-piece, and two kangaroo dogs.</p>
<p>Thus accoutred, we departed, each with a blanket, and an
additional pair of shoes tied on his back. Captain Barker wished
that he could be of the party; but circumstances prevented him.
He, Dr. Davis, and Lieutenant Sleeman, accompanied us a mile or
two, and then, wishing us a prosperous journey, returned.</p>
<p>After having proceeded, by a native path, nearly seven miles
N.N.W., we crossed a considerable stream, running easterly, which
was supposed to be the principal branch of King's River; and
about three miles farther, we passed another, of smaller size,
running in the same direction. We halted to the north-west of a
detached hill; and, as the sun was powerful, we agreed to rest a
little, and partake of some refreshment.</p>
<p>It being my intention to proceed a considerable distance in
the direction of Swan River, I had already to coax
Mok&#259;r&#275;, who, imagining we were going to Porrongorup (a
chain of hills about twenty-five miles north from the
settlement), as Captain Wakefield and others had formerly done,
did not seem to relish taking any other direction. Having rested
sufficiently, we resumed our journey, and proceeded, at a pretty
brisk pace, for a few miles, when one of the party fell suddenly
down, the heat of the day having overpowered him. This caused us
some alarm, but he soon recovered.</p>
<p>It was proposed that we should now take up our night quarters,
and renew our journey at daylight; but, being aware that it would
not do, to be idle or indifferent, in the beginning of our
expedition, and wishing to show an example, I took the invalid's
burden over my own shoulder, and marched off,&mdash;the poor
fellow following, and begging me to let him carry it; but, as he
really appeared fagged, I did not accede to his pressing
solicitation. Thus we proceeded until the evening, when we
bivouacked in the vicinity of an extensive but shallow lagoon,
the water of which we found excellent.</p>
<p>On Thursday, at daylight, we resumed our journey N.N.W., all
well; at nine o'clock we arrived at a large lagoon, from three to
six feet deep, where we halted, kindled a fire, and took
breakfast; an empty preserved-meat-canister serving the double
purpose of tea-kettle and tea-pot.</p>
<p>Being refreshed by a cup of strong tea, and a cold bath in the
lagoon, we renewed our journey, to the westward. In a short time,
we perceived an extensive sheet of water, a few hundred yards on
our right: from appearances, we judged that this was permanent,
which supposition Mok&#259;r&#275; confirmed by informing us,
that the natives came hither when, from long-continued drought,
the smaller and shallower lagoons were dried up.</p>
<p>At eleven o'clock, we crossed a mountain stream, running to
the southward, through a valley where the land assumed a more
fertile appearance than that which we had hitherto passed over,
which was either barren scrub, or swampy ground.</p>
<p>At six o'clock, <small>P.M.</small> we arrived at another
stream, running also to the south-westward, where we took up our
quarters for the night Some were employed in making a fire and
cooking supper, and others, who went in search of game, succeeded
in shooting several black cockatoos. Mr. Kent and myself took a
walk for some distance along the banks of this pleasant stream:
we observed that its banks were covered with luxuriant grass,
sprinkled with the yellow buttercup, which put us in mind of
home.</p>
<p>The alluvial soil, however, extends no great distance; but the
gently-swelling, lightly-wooded adjacent hills are well adapted
for sheep-walks, and this is the more desirable, as, in all my
excursions, in the vicinity of Swan River, I saw very little
pasturable land.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, we directed our course N.W. by W., passing
through a tract of land, diversified by moderately elevated
hills, and fertile and well-watered valleys.</p>
<p>About nine o'clock, we turned to the eastward, to gain the
summit of a hill perceived in that direction, for the purpose of
getting a few bearings, and obtaining a view of the surrounding
landscape. Having left this situation, we altered our course to
N.W. by N., and walked about eight miles, over a tract of scrubby
barren land. We then arrived at a swampy flat, where, there being
good water, we stopped, and dined. Departing thence, and altering
our course a little, a rich and romantic country soon burst into
view, which we found abundantly supplied with good water.</p>
<p>In the evening, we encamped near a stream, running north-west,
through land bearing considerable resemblance, both in appearance
and quality, to the Cow-pastures in the county of Camden, New
South Wales. We saw several flocks of kangaroos; and, as
Mok&#259;r&#275; had previously informed us, "not one,&mdash;not
two,&mdash;not three,&mdash;but many in a flock." We also saw
frequent traces of the native dog.</p>
<p>Whether it was that Mok&#259;r&#275; had got into an enemy's
country, we did not know; but he was particularly on the alert
during the night. Some noise, not sufficient to arouse any other
of the party, made him start up, seize his musket, and level it
at something, which he afterwards said was a <i>to-ort</i> (a
dog). The alarm having ceased, we resumed our slumbers till
daybreak.</p>
<p>On Saturday, as the kangaroos appeared in great abundance, it
was thought prudent to let half a day be spent in hunting them,
to prevent interruption on our journey, and also to obtain a
fresh mess for ourselves and the dogs, which did not appear to be
thriving on their limited allowance.</p>
<p>We left one man to guard our prisoners. Mr. Kent and myself
went to the westward, and the others to the eastward. About noon,
we re-assembled, unsuccessful; the kangaroos proving far too
fleet for the dogs, while the sportsmen, from the open nature of
the country, could not approach sufficiently near them,
unperceived. The land was observed to continue of the same good
quality, in both directions.</p>
<p>Before proceeding on our journey, we took a slight repast;
and, while in the act of doing so, Mok&#259;r&#275; sprang on his
legs, seized his musket, and ran forward, making a hideous noise.
We soon perceived the cause of this conduct: a native was
advancing towards us, with that kind of confidence, inspired
either from fearing no danger, or from a consciousness that
support was at hand.</p>
<p>Mok&#259;r&#275; was commanded not to fire; but there was no
disturbance, as the native lads soon recognized each other. The
stranger joined us with the utmost confidence, and partook of our
repast. He was a good looking fellow (comparatively speaking),
and his well-formed limbs, and general good condition, proved
that he had an abundant and constant supply of nutriment.</p>
<p>He and Mok&#259;r&#275; entered into an animated conversation.
The stranger, in relating his story, did it in a sort of
recitative, far from being disagreeable. Mok&#259;r&#275;, who,
at first, talked in the tone that he had acquired from us, soon
relapsed into the same <i>recitativo</i>, which, it would appear,
is their natural way of communicating with each other.</p>
<p>We understood that he was on a hunting expedition; his present
occupation being to assist in driving the kangaroos to a certain
place, where they could be surrounded, and speared. He told us,
that Will (a powerful chief, to whom all this tract of country
belonged) was at no great distance to the eastward, and would be
glad to see us.</p>
<p>From what I could learn, there is no doubt that a great extent
of good land exists in that direction, to the northward of the
Porrongorup and Morillup ranges. But, as I had previously
arranged, in my own mind, the plan of our journey, I did not wish
to deviate from it.</p>
<p>My determination was, to proceed, for three or four days, in
the direction of Swan River; then to bend to the
westward;&mdash;then southward,&mdash;and to return, to the
settlement, by the sea coast. In conformity with this
arrangement, the stranger's invitation was declined, to the great
chagrin of Mok&#259;r&#275;, and some others of the party, who
felt the desire for exploring much diminished, by learning from
him, that the land was very barren, and bad for travelling, in
the direction we purposed to pursue, and infested with
snakes.</p>
<p>We sent, by the stranger, our respects to Will, and an
invitation for him to visit King Ya-nup (the name the natives
give the Sound), where he, and any of his tribe, would meet a
friendly reception. I regretted that we could not go to see the
natives&mdash;our time being limited, and our object defined.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><small>Pass through a fertile tract of

restored&mdash;Conversation with Mok&#259;r&#275; relative to a
future state of existence&mdash;Journey resumed to the
Westward&mdash;Arrive at a Lake&mdash;Barren Land&mdash;Proceed
to the Southward through a hilly tract&mdash;Course altered to
the Eastward&mdash;Ascend a Mountain, and obtain an extensive
view.</small></p>
<p><small>WE</small> now pursued a course directly north, passing
through a country keeping the same general character,&mdash;good,
open, forest land, without much timber. We started several flocks
of kangaroos, but had no success, either in killing or catching
any, though several ran pretty close to the sportsmen.</p>
<p>Mok&#259;r&#275;, however, irritated by repeated
disappointments, and determined to succeed, if possible, stripped
himself naked; and we observed, with much curiosity, his
manoeuvres. On perceiving a flock of kangaroos, which he did much
sooner than any of the party, he walked, with the greatest
caution, towards them, and continued doing so, while they were
feeding. When any of them happened to look up, he stood firm in
the position he might be in, without moving either body or limb,
and so continued until they again began to feed, when he renewed
his cautious approach; endeavouring, if he could, to get behind a
tree. But, with all this caution, he did not succeed; as, before
he got within gun-shot, they took to their heels, and bounded
away with a swiftness that left the dogs, who were nearly knocked
up, far behind. To make up for this loss, two or three bandicoots
were caught.</p>
<p>Some of the party now believed, or affected to believe, that I
intended to take them to Swan River, and became very uneasy in
consequence; more particularly Gough, the soldier, who, although
he had been all through the Peninsular war, and of necessity
exposed to many hardships and privations, yet did not relish the
idea of being so far in a country, where no European had ever
before ventured; especially as our provisions were not very
plentiful. I had, therefore, to bear broad hints, and some
ill-humour, with as much urbanity as policy required.</p>
<p>To add to this discontent, we had travelled a considerable
distance without having fallen in with any water, and the day was
rapidly declining; but, hoping to meet with some before dark, we
pushed forward, at a very brisk pace, and about sunset we arrived
at a valley nearly destitute of trees, where Mok&#259;r&#275;
succeeded in shooting a large kangaroo; and a native reservoir of
water being, at the same time, discovered, the party immediately
became in good spirits, and entered, <i>con amore</i> into the
business of preparing the feast.</p>
<p>So much has been said, and written, on the resemblance of many
spots in New South Wales to noble English domains, that I forbear
to make the comparison. Suffice it to observe, that our present
encampment was on the north side of a beautiful valley, of
considerable width, extending east and west, as far as the eye
could survey; bounded on the south and north by a succession of
gently undulating, and very moderately elevated hills, thinly,
but sufficiently ornamented by trees, of gigantic form;&mdash;the
loveliness of the scene being greatly increased, by the golden
rays of the departing sun, gradually yielding to the silvery
light of the full-orbed moon, and the brilliant evening star.</p>
<p>The party having exerted themselves, soon completed our
encampment, kindled a fire, and the kangaroo was speedily cooked
in various ways. While these operations were going on, I
endeavoured to ascertain, from Mok&#259;r&#275;, who understood a
little English, whether he, or any of his tribe, had any notion
of a future state of existence, or of a Superior Being; but I
felt some difficulty in making him comprehend my meaning.</p>
<p>I stated to him, that man was composed of two parts; one of
which, when he died, was just like the kangaroo, and all other
animals, which did not speak;&mdash;that the other part did not
die:&mdash;and if the man were good, he ascended to the sky,
where he lived happily with his Maker, and the Maker of the sun,
moon, and stars; whereas, the bad man went down beneath the
earthy and dwelt with a malignant being, named "Devil", whose
sole occupation consisted in tormenting. He Immediately said,
that they had the same opinion; but I am convinced he only caught
the idea from me.</p>
<p>He asked, who were bad men? I told him, those who killed
others without just cause. He answered "Very good, bad man to go
to the Debil." He admitted it was all right, so far as regarded
killing a white man, but I could not persuade him, that there was
any harm in one black fellow spearing another; which, on the
contrary, he considered in some cases, meritorious.</p>
<p>I then told him, that all those who stole were also bad men.
He started in amazement, and repeated with an air of incredulity,
"<i>Quepel!</i>" (to steal). It was evident, that he viewed this
action in a more favourable light than even the Spartans did. I
learned from him, that it was usual, on such a night as this, for
the natives (who seldom travel in the dark) to steal privately on
those whom they wished to destroy, and despatch them.</p>
<p>He knew several of the stars, but pretended to a knowledge of
more of them than he really possessed; however, on
cross-examination, I was convinced that he was acquainted with
Venus and the Atlantic Sisters; likewise with Orion, Canopus, and
Achernar.</p>
<p>Supper being prepared, his examination ended, of which he was
beginning to get tired. They all turned to, and I was astonished
at the immense quantity which some of them literally
<i>bolted</i> down their throats. Mr. Kent and myself contented
ourselves with soup, made from the tail of the kangaroo, which,
with the addition of a little biscuit and rice, was exceedingly
palatable.</p>
<p>This being Saturday night, a double allowance of grog was
issued to the party, who were now in high glee, and talked with
the utmost <i>sang froid</i> of going to Swan River; and I took
this opportunity of explaining, that no person could be called a
good bushman, unless he could walk a day or two without eating or
drinking, which position appeared (especially to Gough) not very
tenable.</p>
<p>I may here describe the usual method of encampment on such
expeditions. A convenient spot being selected, if possible, to
windward of a large fallen half-burned tree, a few branches and
bushes are placed in a semicircular form, as a defence from the
night wind; the log is kindled, and soon forms a blazing fire,
which, being too fierce for cooking, a smaller one is used for
that purpose. After supper, each rolls himself in his blanket,
and, with his feet towards the fire, soon fells asleep.</p>
<p>Before retiring to rest, we made arrangements to guard against
being suddenly surprised; but, as both men and dogs had indulged
in excessive gluttony, not much watchfulness could be expected
from either party.</p>
<p>We were now nearly seventy miles, in a north-westerly
direction, from the settlement, in a country well adapted either
for pastoral or agricultural purposes; and I regretted,
exceedingly, that want of time compelled me to make it the <i>ne
plus ultra</i> of my excursion northward, where, I am convinced,
the same kind of land exists, to a great extent.</p>
<p>On Sunday, at daylight, we resumed our journey west, through
the valley, which bore marks of being occasionally overflowed. We
had not proceeded far, when my ears were saluted with the cry of
the young man who was following close behind me,&mdash;"Oh,
doctor! you are a gone man! a snake has a hold of you!" I jumped
forward; and then, turning round, beheld the ancient enemy of the
human race, rearing its hateful form above the grass, and hissing
defiance. It was soon dispatched, although I, having trod on it,
was the aggressor. It caught me on the outside of the right knee,
but, my trowsers being wide, fortunately the bite did not reach
my skin.</p>
<p>This narrow escape caused some reflection; I thought it would
have been a lamentable termination of my career&mdash;after
having escaped the perils of shipwreck&mdash;to perish by the
bite of a black snake, in the wilds of New Holland.</p>
<p>We continued our journey, and I requested Mok&#259;r&#275; to
precede me; not only as he had much quicker eyes, but as mine
(such as they were) had sufficient occupation in watching the
compass. But he did not seem to relish the preference given him
on this occasion, and soon fell behind.</p>
<p>About nine o'clock, we arrived at a shallow lagoon, the water
of which, to our fastidious taste, was somewhat brackish.
Perceiving water at a short distance, directly north of this, we
proceeded thither, and observed a circular basin, of considerable
extent, literally covered with majestic black swans, ducks, teal,
and other aquatic birds. Judging it would not be amiss to get a
few of these, we agreed to halt, and take a late breakfast and
early dinner together.</p>
<p>Mok&#259;r&#275; being a good shot, was desired to exert his
skill in that way, and then to swim in for his game. To my
astonishment, he told me he could not swim. Not believing this, I
urged him to proceed; but neither flattery nor raillery could
prevail on Mok&#259;r&#275;, who, in order to induce us to leave
the place, informed me it abounded with very venomous snakes.</p>
<p>A thick and broad belt of reeds, above eighteen feet high,
surrounded the lake; and Gough, who was a keen sportsman, was
requested to walk through, and get us something. This he
proceeded to do; but, having taken a few steps, the water being
above his waist, he retrograded in double quick time, evidently
to the satisfaction of Mok&#259;r&#275;, who had ascended a tree,
to witness the result.</p>
<p>Mr. Kent and myself offered to go on each side of Gough, to
prevent his being drowned, in case the water suddenly became
deep; but he declined making any further attempt, which was then
taken up by others, who were also unsuccessful, as may readily be
imagined, when it is stated that the water was upwards of six
feet deep at the inner margin of the sedgy belt.</p>
<p>On regaining the dry land, which was done with some
difficulty, we were surprised to see the blood streaming from
various parts of our bodies, which, on inspection, we found to be
covered with leeches&mdash;the true <i>hirudo medicinalis</i>. We
had felt, while in the water, several sharp bites, which made us
start, and call to mind the black snake: these were now
satisfactorily accounted for.</p>
<p>The water-fowl being disturbed, flew to the southward. The
sportsmen followed them to the shallow lagoon, and succeeded in
obtaining a brace of fine teal, which, with the remainder of the
kangaroo, were cooked for our repast. This being finished, we
left the lake, which we named Loch Ketturine; and, resuming our
course to the westward, we soon perceived that we had left the
good land behind us.</p>
<p>After having travelled over a few miles of barren scrub,
observing, as we thought, rising ground to the northward, we bent
our steps thither, and found good forest land; the altitude of
the trees giving it, when viewed at a distance, the appearance of
considerable elevation. We again proceeded westward, and passed
over a tract of country, as miserable and useless as any to be
found in New South Wales.</p>
<p>In the evening we reached and suddenly re-entered on fine open
land; several hundred acres being without a tree. This was very
agreeable to us, tired and disheartened by our fatiguing journey;
but our pleasure was somewhat alloyed, by not being able to
procure water, of which, however, we had three quart bottles with
us. We prepared to encamp; but as the water could not be shared
very plentifully, among six men and two dogs (the latter very
deserving and thirsty, haying just returned from a severe chase
after a flock of kangaroos), there was not much talk of going to
Swan River, and Gough became very uncivil, threatening to knock
Mok&#259;r&#275; down, if he did not find water immediately. I
was obliged to interfere, and, by digging a hole, we obtained a
supply of good quality.</p>
<p>Next morning I informed those who were tired of the journey,
that they might return, that Mok&#259;r&#275; would go with them,
to guide them on their way, and that they might take all the
provision, excepting a little biscuit. This proposition came like
a thunderbolt. Mr. Kent, to whom I had previously communicated my
intention, agreed to keep company with me, as also did the Crown
prisoners. Gough said he would not go back, as he could never
find his way home, and that Mok&#259;r&#275; was now as much at a
loss as himself.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* This was the case, Mok&#259;r&#275; being far
from his known ground.]</p>
<p>I then explained to him, not to suppose I had wished his
company altogether for the pleasure of his society; on the
contrary, it was under the idea that he would make himself
useful, which he had not hitherto conspicuously done. I again
desired him to return home, and inform them at the settlement,
that we should be there in a day or two after him; but he
persisted in remaining with the party. Observing that he was now
completely crest-fallen, I made no further observation, than
threatening, that if he henceforth conducted himself with any
impropriety, I would leave him in the bush without ceremony.</p>
<p>This fracas being thus amicably terminated, we continued our
westerly course; about noon, we arrived at and crossed a fine
stream, running southerly, which was named the Kent, in
compliment to the gentleman who accompanied me. Having rested
here half an hour, we pursued our journey in a N.N.W. direction
for the highest part of a range of hills, which now met our
view.</p>
<p>Early in the evening, we bivouacked near a mountain torrent,
in the midst of a wildly picturesque glen; the temperature, had
other indications been wanting, sufficiently denoting that we
were among the mountains.</p>
<p>During this day's journey, we passed over some good land, and
more that might be made something of; but by far the greatest
portion was either indifferent, or very barren.</p>
<p>We noticed several native encampments, but did not fall in
with any of the natives; Mok&#259;r&#275; discovered some traces
of them, and amongst others, a love token: a lock of hair,
interwoven with some network, which he informed us, a fair, or
rather a sable, damsel had hid; and it was the business of the
enamoured swain to find it out, when he was rewarded for his
assiduity by the favour of his mistress. If this be true, it
shows that the aborigines of this place, if not more civilized,
are, at all events, more romantic in their courtship than their
brethren in the vicinity of Port Jackson, whose method is short
and effectual; as they steal by ambush on the object of their
affections, beat her senseless with a club, and then drag her off
by the hair of the head, in triumph, to their own party.</p>
<p>The huts in this place are similar to those we noticed at Swan
River, bearing an exact resemblance to a bee-hive cut vertically
in two, with the convex side to that part most exposed to the
wind and rain.** Perceiving several that were formed in the same
manner as the others, but as if the hive (after being cut
vertically) opened by a hinge, thus forming two, we learned from
Mok&#259;r&#275;, that these were the apartments of the married
people; we observed they were placed at some distance from each
other, and from the other habitations.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The description of these habitations given by
Vancouver, nearly half a century ago, coincides precisely with
their appearance at the present day.]</p>
<p>This evening Mok&#259;r&#275;, whether instigated by others or
of his own accord, entered into a serious remonstrance with me on
the impropriety of travelling any farther, as we were a long way
from home, and the provisions were nearly expended, when (he
said) the white fellows would cry; he also hinted that had he
known before starting as much as he did now, he would have
declined being one of the party. He said, the expeditions of
Captain Wakefield and the others, had been <i>maatinip</i>,***
while mine had been already <i>maatopen</i>.****</p>
<p class="foot">[*** A short distance.]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** A long distance.]</p>
<p>I told him, that the white fellows cared little about having
anything to eat, and only cried when they could not get water;
but being convinced that the case was widely different, he told
me it was not a matter to make a joke of. I then told him to make
himself quite easy, as, if we did not get another kangaroo
shortly, his advice should be followed; and in order to create a
little good humour, a double allowance of grog was issued, which
had the desired effect; and "God save the King" was sung with
much vociferation, where it never had been chanted before.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, we directed our course S.S.W. taking care to leave
on our left, all the streams we met with; and in this manner we
proceeded over hills and dales, until our progress was arrested
by a swamp, wide and apparently deep, trending westward round the
mountains. Mok&#259;r&#275;, (who had much antipathy to water if
of any depth,) and others of the party discovering some
repugnance to attempt a passage directly across it, we took a
<i>d&eacute;tour</i> to the eastward, and crossed it where it was
much narrower, and not more than two or three feet deep.</p>
<p>As, at this time, the thunder was rolling heavily,&mdash;the
peals rendered more terrific and sublime, by the echoing hills;
the rain pouring down in torrents, and the explorers, (some of
whom wished themselves elsewhere,) being up to the middle in
water, we thought it might not be inaptly named, the "Dismal
Swamp".</p>
<p>Just as we crossed this, the dogs started a fine kangaroo,
and, after a short run, caught it, having the advantage from the
wetness of the ground. This welcome burden being hoisted on
Mok&#259;r&#275;'s shoulders, we proceeded in a southerly
direction, crossing an ironstone barren tract, intersected by
small strips of good land.</p>
<p>Towards evening we arrived at another swamp, about 150 yards
wide, and from two to three feet deep, winding eastward round the
hills. Having passed this we encamped earlier than usual, being
somewhat fatigued by our day's journey: the rain continued to
fall heavily during the evening, but the party having plenty to
eat, were in good humour. As appearances indicated that the
weather would be wet and windy during the night, we formed our
tents in the gipsy fashion, which afforded us a very snug and
convenient shelter.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, at daylight, we proceeded in a southerly
direction, through a country in general barren, but not
altogether destitute of patches of very good land. About nine
o'clock, perceiving a high, conical, insulated hill, bearing E.
by S., we directed our course thither, passing through a rich
valley, of considerable extent, where the dogs caught a
kangaroo.</p>
<p>About one, <small>P.M.</small>, we halted close by a pebbly
stream, which rushed, with impetuosity, through the bottom of a
deep, narrow glen, where the trees were of enormous circumference
and altitude. This being a delightful spot, it was agreed to
pitch our encampment, and remain until the morning, to allow such
as required it, to take a little rest.</p>
<p>Being anxious to obtain a panoramic view of the country, which
could be advantageously seen from the top of the mountain, I
determined to ascend it; and, accompanied by Mr. Kent and
Mok&#259;r&#275;, started from our encampment at four,
<small>P.M.</small>, and reached its highest pinnacle by
half-past six, when we enjoyed a prospect that more than repaid
all our fatigue.</p>
<p>The highest peak is about thirty yards square, perfectly
level, paved with minute particles of quartz and granite, and a
huge block of the latter material adorns each angle. As this had
some resemblance to a fortified place, it was named "Mount
Lindesay", in compliment to the officers of the thirty-ninth
regiment.</p>
<p>From the summit, the following bearings were taken; but, from
our having only a small pocket compass, they cannot be considered
as strictly accurate.&mdash;<i>From the S.E. angle</i>. Mount
Melville, E.S.E.; Peakhead, S.E. by E. &frac12;E.; east point of
Porrongorup, E., northerly; west point of ditto, E. by N.
&frac34;N.; highest western peak, E. by N., northerly; south head
of a large inlet (close to the sea, and trending from N.E. by E.
to S.W. by W.), S. &frac14;E.; high hill to the west of the
inlet, under which, apparently, it communicates with the sea, S.
by W.</p>
<p><i>From the N.E. angle</i>.&mdash;The western point of
Morrilup, N.E. by E.; from this bearing to N.W. (except some very
distant high land, bearing N. by E.), the country appeared level
as far as the eye could survey. <i>From the N. W</i>. the land
rises, and becomes gradually higher; and from this point round to
the southward, it appears like the ocean convulsed by a storm:
this resemblance being augmented by the setting sun's refracted
rays gleaming faintly through the "horizontal misty air."</p>
<p>In the midst of this alpine region, three mountains are
conspicuous, from their superior altitude; and as they will be
leading points in a trigonometrical survey of the country, we
named them after the Surveyors-General of Australia.</p>
<p><i>From the S.W. angle</i>, a group of islands (four) middle
of the west and largest isle, S.W. &frac34;S.; high distant land,
W. southerly; extreme part of the sea visible on the right, W. by
S. &frac12;S.; land, supposed Cape Nuyts, S.W. &frac12;W.; and a
little after the sun went down, we perceived a large expanse of
water close to the sea coast, bearing S.W. &frac12;S., and
imagined it to be near, perhaps, to the westward of. Cape
Chatham.</p>
<p>These observations being made, we continued admiring the
magnificent scene until daylight departed. We then deemed it
prudent to remain till the moon had attained some altitude in the
eastern sky, lest we might lose our way, or meet with some
accident, while descending the mountain in the dark. This delay
was rather agreeable than otherwise, the night being serene and
mild&mdash;exactly according with the beautiful description of
Milton:</p>
<br>
<p class="indent"><small>"Now came still evening on, and twilight
grey<br>
Had in her sober livery all things clad;<br>
                  Now glowed the firmament<br>
With living sapphires; Hesperus, that led<br>
The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon.<br>
Rising in clouded majesty, at length<br>
Apparent queen, unveil'd her peerless light.<br>
And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw."</small></p>
<br>
<p>We observed the smoke from our encampment, hovering over the
trees, far beneath us to the westward; and Mok&#259;r&#275;, who
would much rather have been below, eating kangaroo, than admiring
the sublime and beautiful from the top of the mountain, was very
urgent in his entreaties for us to descend; and, at length, his
wishes were complied with.</p>
<p>We reached our party, without any accident, and were welcomed
by "the watch dog's honest bark", and found a blazing fire, a
pretty bower, and a comfortable supper, prepared for us.</p>
<p>Having, unfortunately, sprained my ankle, in jumping over a
stream, on the second day's journey, I suffered very severely
from the pain in descending the mountain. To allay this, I placed
my foot in the running stream, wherein I found an excellent,
though unexpected, remedy;&mdash;a number of leeches soon fixed
on it, and were gladly permitted to drink their fill.</p>
<p>From what Mok&#259;r&#275; told me, I thought that the natives
were in the habit of applying them in certain cases; but, on more
minute enquiry, I found he had picked up his knowledge of their
utility from having been present when they were applied by the
surgeon of the settlement. He said, "they were very good for
white fellow, but very bad for the blacks;" by whom great caution
was always used while drinking, to guard against their entering
into the mouth with the water, which, nevertheless, sometimes
happened, and occasioned fatal consequences.</p>
<p>During the night, the bell bird supplied, to us, the place of
the wakeful nightingale; and at daybreak, we were awakened by the
tuneful voices of several singing birds. This was a pleasing
surprise, as we had hitherto supposed that the birds in New
Holland were not famed for song.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Vancouver has also noticed, that some of the
small birds on this part of the coast sing very melodiously.]</p>

<p class="negindent"><small>Proceed on our Journey&mdash;Discover
a large Inlet into which several Rivers empty
themselves&mdash;Arrive at the Settlement&mdash;Captain Barker's
Narrative&mdash;General Remarks on our Journey&mdash;A Native
Dance&mdash;Curious Prescription of a Native Doctor.</small></p>
<p><small>ON</small> Thursday morning, we left, with some regret,
this delightful glen; and, walking round the southern base of
Mount Lindesay, we were not long in meeting with another rivulet,
winding round its eastern side, and, joining that at which we had
halted last night;&mdash;the united streams being about thirty
feet wide, and five deep, running directly south.</p>
<p>This reach, however, only extends a few hundred yards, when it
expands, and runs rapidly over a bed of granite. Those who wished
it, enjoyed here the refreshing luxury of a cold bath; and
Mok&#259;r&#275; was advised to endeavour to learn to swim, but,
having no ambition to attain this accomplishment, he kept at a
prudent distance, lest he might, through frolic, be tumbled
in.</p>
<p>The banks, as far as we examined, are rich, but, (as may be
readily imagined, from the precipitous nature of the country,)
very narrow; the surrounding hills, however, are of good soil,
and might easily be turned to some account. The trees,
principally blue gum, are the finest I have ever seen.</p>
<p>Leaving this river, which was named the Denmark (in compliment
to a physician of the British fleet,) we proceeded south-east,
crossing, in our way, several streams of pure water, which might,
according to Australian phraseology, be called rivers.</p>
<p>This day's journey was, from the abrupt nature of the country,
very fatiguing. The land on the hills was sometimes good,
sometimes indifferent, but more frequently very barren. That of
the valleys was, in general, of a fair quality. In the evening,
we encamped near a stream, running through a valley&mdash;as all
the others did&mdash;to the southward.</p>
<p>On Friday, at daybreak, we started; and Mok&#259;r&#275;,
having got on known ground, now led the way. After having
travelled four hours, at a pretty brisk pace, we arrived at a
river, upwards of fifty yards wide, and apparently deep, flowing
slowly to the southward. We walked along its right bank, and, in
a short time, reaching its mouth, we observed that it poured its
waters into the inlet seen from Mount Lindesay, Unfortunately, a
bar of sand runs across it,&mdash;there were not more than
eighteen inches or two feet water, where we passed over:
immediately inside, there is from three to seven feet water, and,
at a little distance up, the river becomes deeper. I considered
this the termination of the mountain stream, where we encamped
after the third day's journey. It was named the Hay, in
compliment to the under Secretary of State for the Colonies.</p>
<p>We then walked along the shore, for about a mile and a half,
when we arrived at another river emptying its waters also into
the inlet: there is also a bar across its mouth, which was, at
present, nearly dry. Inside the bar, it is about five feet deep,
and ten yards wide. I considered this the termination of the
stream, which we crossed on the afternoon of the second day,
where the land began to improve. It was named the Sleeman, in
compliment to the late Commandant of King George's Sound.</p>
<p>We halted here, to take some refreshment, and a little rest;
and while the repast was preparing, Mr. Kent and I walked out
some distance in the shallow water, to take a few bearings. Mount
Lindesay bore N.W. by N. The high conical hill (seen from Mount
Lindesay, bearing S. by W.), whose base was apparently washed by
the inlet, at about fifteen miles distance, bore west.</p>
<p>This beings the most conspicuous land to the west of Cape
Howe, and close to the sea, it was named Mount Hallowell, in
compliment to the gallant admiral of that name, under whose flag
I served, and from whom I received my first promotion in the
service, at the instance of my friend Dr. Denmark.</p>
<p>High land to seaward (between which and Mount Hallowell I
supposed the communication with the sea to exist) bore W. by S.
&frac34;S. The inlet is nearly circular; the water to the north
and east is shallow, but deep along its southern boundary; on the
west, there is an opening, through which Mount Hallowell is
seen in the distance, whose base is apparently washed by the
waters, and I have no doubt also by the sea, whose mighty voice
was distinctly heard by all of us.</p>
<p>It was imagined that the inlet again expands, receiving the
waters of the Denmark, which we knew must be emptied to the
eastward of Mount Hallowell. This inlet is of considerable size,
being about six miles in diameter, and would, like Melville
Water, make an excellent harbour, if it had an entrance.** I was
on my way to decide the question; but reflecting that the utmost
limit of time allowed me was expired, and that our provisions
were expended, I was induced, although reluctantly, to give up
the attempt.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Sir James Stirling, the Governor of Western
Australia, has done the Author the honour to name this "Wilson's
Inlet".]</p>
<p>That there is a communication of some kind with the sea, there
can be no doubt, as the tide ebbed considerably during the time
we remained. The sand which forms the bar at the mouth of the
river, and which also extends along the shore, does not exceed
six or eight inches in depth, and rests on a bed of fine
clay.</p>
<p>We resumed our journey about two <small>P.M.</small>,
proceeding east, through a country slightly undulating, for two
or three miles, when we arrived at an extensive plain, bounded on
the N. and S. by well wooded hills, occasionally watered by small
streams, and intersected by narrow strips of finely timbered
forest land.</p>
<p>In the evening we encamped near a swamp, rather earlier than
we should have done, in consequence of several of the party being
much weakened from the violent operations of the brackish water;
but this might be considered rather fortunate than otherwise, as
it would tend to obviate the bad effects of repletion; this
explanation, however, was not at all consolatory to the
sufferers, whose appetites had now become more keen, from the
knowledge that there was nothing left to appease the cravings of
hunger, which were becoming very urgent. But, our journey being
so near an end, there was no murmuring.</p>
<p>On Saturday, at break of day, we resumed our march; both men
and dogs keeping a sharp look out for kangaroos. About seven
o'clock, arriving at an inlet of some extent, we bent our course
to the south, and soon came to the beach, when we observed that
West Cape Howe, bore S.S.W. The mouth of the inlet was completely
obstructed by a barrier of sand, over which we passed, several
feet above the level of the sea and inlet.</p>
<p>Having taken several bearings of Cape Howe, Eclipse, and other
Islands, and observed that the bay was Studded with reefs, we
proceeded, for some distance, along the hoarse-resounding shore,
and then crossed over the coast range of sand hills, which, in
geological structure, resembles the coast about Swan River. This
inlet was perceived to be of considerable size, and communicated,
by a serpentine channel, with the lagoon well known to the
sportsmen of the settlement.</p>
<p>Having arrived within a few miles of home, we halted, for the
purpose of shaving, and making ourselves as tidy as our means
would admit, before we entered the camp. This being done, we
continued our nearly finished journey at a pretty brisk pace,
about noon we reached the S.W. side of Princess Royal Harbour,
and walked along its sandy shore; where we observed the recent
foot-marks of several natives, by which Mok&#259;r&#275; was
enabled to tell their names.</p>
<p>Having kept a little brandy in case of need, I distributed it,
when within about half a mile of the camp; and, although the
quantity was small, yet, from the want of food, it raised the
spirits of the party wonderfully; and we entered the settlement,
in good order and high glee, about one o'clock
<small>P.M.</small> after having walked nearly two hundred miles,
over a country previously unknown, without having experienced any
privation worthy of notice.</p>
<p>The natives crowded round Mok&#259;r&#275;, eager to hear the
news from a far country; and the soldiers besieged Gough for the
same purpose, but he wisely declined giving them the least
information until they brought him something to eat; while Mr.
Kent and myself did justice to Dr. Davis's proffered hospitality.
Captain Barker and Lieutenant Sleeman were on board the Governor
Phillips, hastening the arrangements for her departure, when we
arrived. A flag, however, being hoisted from the camp, soon
brought Captain Barker on shore.</p>
<p>Our arrival caused much gladness, as, from our long absence,
fears were entertained, that we must either have been destroyed
by the natives, or that we had lost our way. A great quantity of
wood had been carried to the top of Mount Melville, which was to
have been kindled this evening, to direct us, if haply we might
be wandering about in search of home.</p>
<p>Captain Barker was the only individual who was free from
alarm; but had we not returned this evening, he would also have
begun to suspect that some accident had befallen us. He was much
gratified by the account of our expedition, and determined to
proceed, as soon as his avocations would permit, to examine the
inlet, and also the interior water seen from Mount Lindesay, far
to the westward, where it is likely there may exist a convenient
harbour, with a good entrance.</p>
<p>I may here stop the thread of my own narrative, to introduce
Captain Barker's descriptive account of his excursion over this
tract of country, contained in a letter which I received from him
shortly after my arrival in England.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>"Anxious as I was when you left us, to set at rest
the question of the Western Harbour, various circumstances
prevented my setting out to examine it, till the 3rd inst., when
I proceeded with your old party, Mr. Kent being very desirous of
seeing-out his adventure in that quarter. I had long since,
however, learnt from Mok&#259;r&#275; that the entrance to the
inlet would only admit of boats, and the event is another
confirmation of the general accuracy of the natives. I can only
give you a hasty outline of our journey, as I found a government
vessel here on my return, and have besides, been occupied by some
tedious magisterial business.<br>
<br>
"On the 3d of February, we started at six <small>A.M.</small>,
and avoiding your sand hills, by keeping to the right of the
lagoons, stopped to breakfast at the end of eight or nine miles,
on the banks of a river five yards broad, and nearly as many feet
deep, which Mok&#259;r&#275; said divided above into three small
streams, and came from no great distance. Five miles farther, he
pointed over some wooded hills on our left, to where you had
slept the night before your return, soon after which we got on a
plain, where for about a mile the soil (a reddish and black loam
with clay underneath,) might perhaps be made something of; but
except here, it was indifferent throughout the day; the rising
grounds wooded and strewn with iron stone, the hollows and flats
open and sandy. Mok&#259;r&#275; being unwell, and lagging much
behind, we halted for the night, after going W.N.W. seventeen or
eighteen miles, at a swamp, where the water was very good.<br>
<br>
"On the 4th at five <small>A.M.</small> we proceeded, crossing
several dry beds of streams, and a chain of ponds, and afterwards
bringing up our right shoulders, fell in with the Sleeman, where
it was fifty yards wide and apparently deep. Following its course
towards the inlet, we came to a part only seven yards wide and
eighteen inches deep, where we crossed; but some water that you
had stopped at on leaving the inlet, on the 11th December, being
strongly recommended, we returned to the left bank, and another
mile bringing us to it, we sat down to take our
<i>dejeun&eacute;</i>, and while preparing, I sought an open
view, and found Moun. Hallowell to bear W. &frac12;S., Mount
Lindesay N.W. &frac14;N. A short walk brought us to the inlet,
and I went out, with Mr. Kent, to, as nearly as he could
recollect, the spot where you had taken your bearings, being
about 600 hundred yards from the mouth of the Sleeman, now a dry
sand. I found Mount Lindesay, (the highest part) N. 39&deg;
&frac12;W. Mount Hallowell W. 5&deg; S., agreeing as nearly as
could be expected with your own. I took various other bearings,
both here and at other places, but have not time to arrange them.
Meanwhile the rest of the party moved on to the Hay, to shoot
ducks, but were unsuccessful. Beyond the Hay, we found some very
fine blue gum, though the soil was not apparently rich. There was
sometimes, however, a narrow strip near the inlet, of thick
grass. The bay expands considerably, as you imagined, on the
north shore, but not on the south. We followed its different
windings, from the difficulty of getting over the points of land,
where was often an almost impenetrable underwood, and about ten
miles of not a very straight course brought us from the Hay to
the mouth of the Denmark, about forty yards wide, deep, with a
muddy bottom, and little or no stream. We were obliged to make a
considerable d&eacute;tour into the inlet to avoid deep water,
and passed where it did not exceed thirty inches. Those who
preceded fell in with two native women, one of them perfectly
naked, each carrying a child in a bag of kangaroo skin, and
leading another. They were a little startled till they saw
Mok&#259;r&#275;, with whom they stopped to chat a few minutes,
but would not wait for me. I was then a little up the river,
swimming about for three ducks that had been shot. We proceeded
two or three miles farther, quitting the inlet, and halted for
the night at a water hole in the bed of a small mountain stream.
Mount Hallowell bearing W. 34&deg; S. distant two miles and a
half.<br>
<br>
February 5th.&mdash;Wound round the N.E. of Mount Warrumbup, over
stony and rocky ground, but with fine blue gum occasionally, and
again approaching the inlet, stopped to breakfast at a small
running stream washing the foot of Mount Hallowell. Here two
natives joined us, and I left them with half our party to spear
wallabi and shoot ducks, while I went with Mr. Kent and
Mok&#259;r&#275; to the mouth of the inlet, wading through some
luxuriant grass, in a rich soil part of the way, but it was of no
great extent. We passed a few small streamlets, but with little
water in them, the dry weather since you were here, having made a
great change. The inlet, as you approach its mouth, for a mile or
two becomes shallow all the way across. The communication between
it and the sea is through a break in the coast line of hills
(which appeared a calcareous sandstone, like those near us), of
nearly 700 yards; but it is only at very high tides that the
water covers this. It was now (at noon on the 5th) a flat dry
sand, with a small channel near the centre the narrowest part of
which was only thirty yards wide. About ten yards of this was out
of my depth, but I came back more within the inlet, where it had
widened to a hundred yards, and found no part deeper than four
feet. The sand was yielding, and it is probable that in the rainy
season, when there must be a considerable discharge of water, it
may force itself a broader and deeper channel. The surf outside,
at a short distance from where I passed, was very heavy, and I
think no boat would be able to come in, except in very fine
weather, and with the wind off the land. I do not say but that a
navigable passage might be made; but where is the equivalent for
the expense, for a hundred years to come? A small stream of
delicious water rises near the cliff, forming the west point of
entrance, and, running a few hundred yards, falls into the inlet.
From this cliff. Mount Hallowell bore N. 43&deg; &frac12;W., the
nearest opposite shore about N.E. &frac34;E., and the east point
of the bay to seaward E. 29&deg; S. I have not leisure to
calculate my distance, but consider it about thirty-two English
miles from the settlement in a direct line. Our native friends
had not come back from their wallabi hunting, on our return to
the party, but one (Cumwhite) made his appearance just as we were
finishing our dinner. He led us some distance towards the Denmark
by a better and shorter route than we had come, and then wishing
us good-night, returned to his family. We slept about a mile east
of the Denmark, Mok&#259;r&#275; being puzzled to find the
watering place, though any spot might have done, for the rain was
coming down in torrents.<br>
<br>
"February 6th.&mdash;Before we moved this morning, having been
delayed till past seven in baking dampers, as we had no biscuit,
Cum-white, and four other natives, joined us; two of whom
accompanied us towards Mount Lindesay. After walking an hour and
a quarter, Mr. Kent's dog started and killed a kangaroo (about
100lbs), to the delight of all, and not least of our two new
friends; one of whom leading the way, and striking to the west,
after the pleasing burthen had been hoisted on Gough's shoulders,
we soon came to a deep narrow glen, at the bottom of which was a
small stream running south, where we breakfasted, and cut up our
game; and I never shall forget the capacious appetites of
Cumwhite and Talpar, who certainly did their part towards the
fulfilment of the custom of the natives, to eat up the kangaroo
where it is killed. We put up for night at a small stream on the
eastern foot of Mount Lindesay, which Talpar, Mr. Kent, and
myself, ascended; Mok&#259;r&#275; having eaten too much kangaroo
to be able to move, he, therefore, very shrewdly told me, the
other knew the way better. The view was indeed magnificent, but I
was unable to enjoy it as you did, in consequence of a haze
coming on, and which also prevented my taking many bearings. The
few I got correctly agreed with yours, except the distant
interior water, which I made W.S.W. &frac12;S. nearly. You call
it S.W. &frac12;S., having, probably, left out the first W. Mr.
Kent had it W. by S. &frac12;S. After our descent, I had a long
talk with Mok&#259;r&#275;, and the two others, about this said
water, which I considered about thirty miles off. They called it
two days' journey, and, you will be pleased to hear, persisted in
saying it would admit of large vessels. I could not, however, get
at their means of judging, and have, therefore, my doubts till I
see the place; for you know they are unable to swim, and have no
boats, so that they would probably make no distinction in the
depth of any water that was permanently over their head. Our
provisions would not permit our going so far comfortably, and I
had no mind to try the mettle of my party, as you were obliged to
do; but I shall not lose sight of the place. They describe the
land as very barren.<br>
<br>
"February 7th.&mdash;I ascended part of the mountain this
morning, with the intention of going again to the top of it, had
it been clear; but, after waiting some time, I found it would be
useless, and rejoined the party, when we set out on our return.
The direct way to the settlement was very bad, we were told, and
therefore edged off to the southward a little, till after we had
passed near the spot where you had slept on the tenth, when we
kept more northerly than you. The land, with a trifling
exception, was very bad; the walking over the iron-stone hills
not the best, but, by all accounts, a turnpike road compared to
some that you had travelled. The natives left us after dinner,
with a promise to visit the settlement in their month, or season,
called Pruhner (about April). We encamped for the night on the
Hay. The bed of it here was considerable, and there were marks of
the water rising six or eight feet above its present level. The
banks were eighteen feet high. The general depth of water was
from one to four feet, and, at first, I thought it stagnant. In
my rambles, however, I found a part where there was a run; but
you will hardly credit me, when I tell you its size. It was
actually less than I could span: it was from one to two inches
deep only, and had a fall of about six inches. This was the whole
breadth of the water: the bed of the river, in this spot, being a
large ironstone rock, over which I walked.<br>
<br>
"February 8th.&mdash;Crossed several dry beds, over an
indifferent country, and two branches of the Sleeman, one dry,
the other inconsiderable. We eventually got into our old track
near the plain, where the soil was tolerable, the first day. We
afterwards turned to the left a little, and slept on one of the
small branches of our first day's river.&mdash;Reached home in
the afternoon, having given the party a great part of the day, to
enable them to carry some game into the settlement; but they met
with no success.<br>
<br>
"The land, during the whole of my excursion, was generally bad;
but it could hardly be expected otherwise in the route I took. I
hear continued good accounts of that in the interior, but it is
now in want of water; and I find that is usually the case two or
three months in the year; wells, however, might be dug.
Mok&#259;r&#275; gives me the names of tribes he has heard of to
a great distance northward, and says he understands their country
to be very fine, but they have no rivers. All their water is
procured from lakes or wells."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>I now resume my narrative, with a few general remarks on our
journey.&mdash;1st, Had we followed the advice of the native, and
proceeded in the direction he wished us, I have no doubt we
should have been enabled to give a much more favourable account
of the fertility of the soil; as, from his report, and the
observation of Mr. Baxter, joined to the knowledge acquired by
ourselves, I believe that a great extent of good land exists to
the north of the Morrillup range; but, be that as it may, I do
not hesitate to affirm, that the area we walked over contained as
much land, fit for every purpose of rural economy, as any
portion, of equal extent, in New South Wales.</p>
<p>In travelling onward, it was a rule for each individual to
carry a day's water, lest we might not meet with any, when we
halted for the night; which, however, we never had occasion to
use, from necessity, excepting once. Indeed, those who wished,
enjoyed the luxury of a cold bath, at least once a day (one day
excepted): it may, therefore, be evident, that the country is
well watered; but it is not to be denied, that, by a long
continuance of drought, many of the streamlets and shallow
lagoons might become dried up. From the situation, however, of
the country, it is not likely that droughts are so frequent here,
as in the neighbourhood of Port Jackson.</p>
<p>The country is also well supplied with several kinds of useful
timber;&mdash;the honeysuckle, swamp oak, blue gum, apple tree,
turpentine, box, &amp;c. flourished luxuriantly, each in its
congenial soil. It may be further observed, that the western
mountains are not, as it was imagined, continuous, there being a
considerable extent of level land between them and the
Porrongorup range; whereby easy communication may be held with
Swan River.</p>
<p>These mountains are similar, in structure, to the Darling
range. They are chiefly composed of a coarse grained granite; the
summits of several which we passed over, were crowned with
immense blocks of this material. The Morrilup and Porrongorup
mountains are, I understand, also of granite. During our
excursions, we observed many beautiful plants; and, imagining
they were yet undescribed, I selected a few with the intention of
presenting them to Mr. Allan Cunningham, on my arrival in
Sydney.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Several of the plants collected here, and at
Swan River, which at that period were unknown, have since been
described; viz. <i>Anigozanthos Manglesii</i> of Don,
<i>Conospermum triplinervium</i> of Brown, <i>Rhodanthe
Manglesii</i> of Lindley; amongst the collection was a very
distinct species of <i>Grevillea</i>, hitherto unpublished, which
is thus characterized by Mr. Cunningham, who has named it, in
compliment to the discoverer.<br>
<br>
<i>Grevillea Wilsoni</i>. C. mss. Foliis bipinnatis: laciniis

<br>
In its native woods, this new Grevillea forms an elegant upright
shrub, two to three feet high, with showy purple flowers, each
half an inch in length, having a pistillum extending as much more
beyond it.]</p>
<p>A considerable concourse of natives had assembled in the camp,
having come to present an address to Lieutenant Sleeman, on his
departure, and to congratulate Captain Barker, on his assuming
the reins of government. A ball and supper had been promised
them, which, through the politeness of Lieutenant Sleeman, had
been deferred until our return, to give us an opportunity of
seeing their manners, and of ascertaining whether they danced as
well as the natives on the north coast.</p>
<p>As soon as it became dark, a large fire was kindled in the
centre of the camp, and the ball commenced, and was kept up with
great spirit; the performers, evidently using their best
endeavours to inspire us with a favourable idea of their
dexterity, were much gratified by our repeated plaudits, which
incited them to still further exertions.</p>
<p>There was not that elegance of gesture which we witnessed
among the Aborigines of Raffles Bay; but there was more meaning
in the dance, although we could not make it out. They began by
marching slowly in a circle round the fire, gradually
accelerating their pace; and then in turns, they placed their
spears at the feet of one of their party who stood outside the
ring viewing, but without taking any part in, the ceremony; then
they danced with might and main, until nearly exhausted, when
they retired to supper, quite elated that their amusement had
apparently given us satisfaction.** Mok&#259;r&#275; did not take
any active part in the dancing; both, it may be supposed, from
his being very tired, and from his affecting to be one of us.</p>
<p class="foot">[** On seeing one of the soldiers' wives among
the spectators, a native made an apology, that he had not his
kangaroo skin, and wished to retire: this was a mark of delicacy,
that made us blush at the want of it in our women, who had
learned not to be squeamish at such sights.]</p>
<p>Shortly after the conclusion of the ball, Mok&#259;r&#275;
brought his relation, a native doctor, to prescribe for me; he
was a man of mild and grave aspect, who was evidently highly
esteemed by, and possessed much influence over, the other
natives. I thanked him for his kindness, and submitted my ankle,
now much swelled and exceedingly painful, to his examination. He
immediately began to press it with his fingers, blowing on it at
the same time; I bore this painful operation as long as I could,
and then told Dr. Eurul (so he was called), that I thought he had
done me much benefit, and that there was no occasion for his
giving himself any further trouble; but he gave it another
squeeze or two, and then went to the door, and blew over his
fingers, and also over his kangaroo skin,&mdash;thus, as I was
told, first taking the disease from me to himself, and then
blowing it away; he was pleased that he had been of service to
me, and seemed to understand medical etiquette too well, to
receive any remuneration from a member of the profession.</p>
<p>This was certainly a new mode of treating a severe sprain; but
I understand it is their <i>panacea</i> for every disease.
However, as may be readily conjectured, the remedy rather
aggravated my complaint, which was now treated <i>secundum
artem</i> by Dr. Davis, from whose assistance, I derived more
benefit than I did, or was likely to do, from the Aboriginal
&AElig;sculapius.</p>

Soil&mdash;Brief account of the Natives&mdash;Departure from King
George's Sound&mdash;Account of the Murder of Captain

<p><small>AS</small> the brig was not yet fit for sea. Lieutenant
Sleeman proposed a boat excursion to Oyster Harbour, and I gladly
agreed to accompany him, being anxious to obtain a view of that
inlet; accordingly on Wednesday morning the weather promising to
be fair, a party, consisting of Lieutenant Sleeman, Dr. Davis,
Mr. Hickey and myself, proceeded in the whale-boat.</p>
<p>On entering the mouth of the harbour, four wild ducks started
up not far from us, and Mr. Hickey, an excellent marksman,
brought down three of them. We landed here to get some water for
the use of the individual who resides, in the capacity of
gardener, on Green Island: thither we went, and I was delighted
to find turnips, carrots, peas, potatoes, cabbages. and other
culinary vegetables, growing in great abundance.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* "For the benefit of those (observes Vancouver)
who may visit the country hereafter, some vine cuttings and water
cresses were planted in an Island in Oyster Harbour, and at the
place from whence we procured our fuel; and an assortment of
garden seeds, with some almonds, oranges, lemon, and pumpkin
seeds, were sown. The whole being the production of Africa, I
should have entertained little doubt of their success, had it not
been that there was much to apprehend in their being overrun by
the natural productions of the country." None of these were found
by us, in either of these spots, and it is probable they were
lost in the way he. anticipated.]</p>
<p>This Island does not contain more than from three to four
acres; the soil is light, but admirably adapted for the growth of
vegetables; we could not, however, help remarking, that should
the 800 ton ship come here with her passengers, as stated in the
newspapers, their several portions would be exceedingly
small.</p>
<p>Having taken a sufficiency of vegetables to serve for dinner,
we proceeded up the harbour, to examine "La Riviere
Fran&ccedil;aise". We found it rather difficult to enter, as its
mouth is, as usual with the other rivers, obstructed by a bar of
mud and sand. Inside the bar the depth is from five to twelve
feet. Here, in a convenient spot, near a fresh water streamlet,
we landed the cook, and the provisions, with directions to
prepare dinner. Mr. Hickey remained to shoot, while Lieutenant
Sleeman and myself proceeded higher up the river, which kept the
same variable depth, being not less than four, nor more than
twelve feet, water rather brackish. The banks were well clothed
with wood, and the various reaches extremely picturesque.</p>
<p>We could not proceed far, having to return to the settlement
in the evening, in consequence of Lieutenant Sleeman being in an
indifferent state of health; he was admonished by the Doctor (who
had great antipathy to sleeping in the open air) to return home
as early as possible. We landed on the left bank of the river,
with the intent of returning to our rendezvous by land.</p>
<p>I observed, in many places, that the land was extremely rich
and good, even to the top of the hills. Lieutenant Sleeman had
formerly visited this spot, and sent a detailed account of its
properties to the Government at Sydney. It was remarked, that if
the settlers could not all get as much of Green Island as they
might desire, here they could be accommodated to a certain
extent. From the inequality of surface, it would not be fit for
the plough, but there could be no doubt that it might be very
advantageously cultivated; as, from its situation, form, and
quality, it appeared well adapted for the growth of the vine.</p>
<p>From the top of the most elevated hill, we obtained an
extensive view of the Sound, and its rugged islands; Princess
Royal, and Oyster, Harbours, with the various windings of "La
Riviere Fran&ccedil;aise" and King's River, through an apparently
fertile country, formed a landscape, not unworthy of the pencil
of a Claude Lorraine.</p>
<p>On our return, we found a most excellent dinner;&mdash;roast
ducks and green peas, beef, potatoes, and cabbage, with Swedish
turnips and carrots;&mdash;to which we sat down with sharp
appetites, and having strong drinks, both fermented and
distilled, we thought ourselves much more fortunate than
Vancouver and his party were, while on a similar expedition to
the same spot. After having enjoyed a short <i>siesta</i>, we
prepared to return; the day being too far spent to permit us
paying a visit to King's River.</p>
<p>We touched again at Green Island, and took as many vegetables
as the boat could carry, for our use during the voyage. The
gardener certainly leads a solitary life here, but he seemed to
like it; his only companion was his bible, which he had displayed
very conspicuously, and, as the uncharitable might imagine,
rather ostentatiously. I must confess that, having so frequently
witnessed the most consummate rogues putting on, successfully, an
appearance of sanctified demeanour, whenever I observe anything
approaching to outward show, I cannot avoid calling to mind
<i>Ambrose Lamella</i>; many of whose fraternity have fallen
under my own notice.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** I may here cite one. From the clergyman of
the hulk at Sheerness, I received an excellent character of a
prisoner, named Brown; in consequence of which, I employed him in
binding books, and treated him with kindness during our voyage in
the ship Richmond. As he had constantly a bible, or other
religious book in his pocket, he passed for an honest man, and
was not narrowly watched. He had, therefore, frequent
opportunities, which he did not fail to profit by, of laying
under contribution several of the officers, and others belonging
to the ship.<br>
<br>
Receiving a hint from his intimate associate, I ordered his trunk
to be searched, in which the stolen property was found. I
observed a letter to the Rev. Mr. Price, thanking him "for having
rescued him (the said hypocrite) from the paths of infamy, and
hoping that his brother, who first taught him to swerve from the
paths of virtue, might, ere this, have paid his justly-forfeited
life to the offended laws of his country."<br>
<br>
From the said brother, whom (strange enough) I carried out some
years afterwards, as a prisoner in the ship Governor Ready, I
learned that this exemplary youth had made his escape from the
colony in a brig; and, after various adventures, had arrived at
Philadelphia, where he was now a <i>respectable</i>
bookseller.<br>
<br>
This brother, who went by the name of Collins, was, immediately
on his arrival at Hobart Town, discovered to be a runaway
convict: consequently, he was immediately packed off to
Macquarrie Harbour for life.]</p>
<p>About four years ago, the British Government, having heard
that the French were about to form a settlement at King George's
Sound,*** were determined to prevent them; and, with this view, a
field-officer (Major Lockyer) was sent from Sydney, with a
detachment of soldiers and prisoners, to claim and keep
possession of it. On their arrival, they learned that the French
had formed an establishment, which they had speedily
abandoned.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** King George's Sound was discovered by
Captain Vancouver, on the 29th of September, 1791, who thus
describes it:&mdash;"This port has its entrance in latitude
35&deg; 5', longitude 118&deg; 17'. It is easily known on
approaching it from the westward, as it is the first opening in
the coast that presents any appearance like a harbour eastward of
Cape Chatham. The Eclipse Islands being the only detached land
that can be so regarded, are an excellent guide to the Sound,
having, between them and Bald Head, some rocks, on which the sea
breaks with great violence. The port is safe, and easy of
access."]</p>
<p>Major Lockyer formed the camp on the north-west side of
Princess Royal Harbour, near a running stream at the foot of two
detached hills, of considerable elevation, which he named Mount
Clarence, and Mount Melville; and the intended town he called
Frederick Town. Having made all necessary arrangements, he left
the charge to Captain Wakefield, of the thirty-ninth regiment,
who was relieved by Lieutenant Sleeman, and he by Captain
Barker.</p>
<p>I understand it is on the point of being given up as an
out-station of Sydney, to form a part of the Government of
Western Australia; and I should not be surprised if it were, ere
long, the seat of that Government&mdash;it being, in many
respects, far preferable to Swan River.</p>
<p>The entrance to Princess Royal (and also to Oyster Harbour,)
is narrow, shallow, and only capable of admitting small vessels;
but the Sound is capacious, and easy of access, affording an
excellent and safe anchorage, to any number of vessels, of any
burden. The land, even in the immediate vicinity, is far from
indifferent, and capable of being rendered very productive; and
the climate is delightful.****</p>
<p class="foot">[**** Vancouver's description is exceedingly
accurate.]</p>
<p>During my short stay, it is not to be supposed that the
information I acquired, concerning the natives, could be very
extensive. I may, however, state, that in personal appearance,
they have a decided resemblance to their Australian brethren, and
their weapons are also similar. They all wear a covering of
kangaroo skins, with the fur next to the skin. They have large
bellies, and slender extremities; but good feeding produces a
wonderful change in their appearance.</p>
<p>They seem a good-tempered race; not so savage-looking as those
of the north coast. They are far from being destitute of
intelligence: on the contrary, they appear very acute. Several of
them reside constantly in the camp, where they are treated with
kindness. Mok&#259;r&#275;, who had always slept in the
Commandant's apartment, now wished to accompany him to Sydney;
but, as he might not have an opportunity of getting back, and as
he would be of use to Captain Barker, he was willing to stay.</p>
<p>This native was quite domesticated, and very intelligent,
humorous, and a wag withal. Observing that those married wore a
ring, and that polygamy did not exist, he thus questioned Dr.
Davis, who wore two:&mdash;"What, doctor, you two
wives?&mdash;Are your wives dead?&mdash;You give them
physic?"</p>
<p>There was a fine little native boy in the camp, that lived
entirely with the soldiers, by whom he was named Wappery; his
good humour, and intelligent features, formed a strong contrast
to the sullen, and bashful Riveral, who appeared, however, quite
contented.</p>
<p>Every day, at noon&mdash;which they seem to know with great
exactness&mdash;the natives, wherever they may be, kindle a fire,
and by this means obtain a knowledge of each other's
situations.</p>
<p>They think it necessary and just to kill some one of a
neighbouring tribe, whenever one of their own number dies, as
they ascribe the death to the incantation of their enemies.</p>
<p>That they have a right of soil, is quite evident. The land
about the settlement belongs to Mok&#259;r&#275; and his
brethren.</p>
<p>Their food principally consists of fish, which they spear in
shallow places, as they never venture above the knees in water,
with their own will; and it is a strange and singular fact, that
none of them swim. They have nothing in the shape of canoes; nor
do they ever cross any river, except at the mouth, which is
usually very shallow; or higher up, where a tree may have
accidentally fallen across, and formed a bridge.</p>
<p>They also derive sustenance from kangaroos, iguanas, and, in
the proper season, from young parrots, eggs, &amp;c., and they
seem to be fond of sucking the cones of various kind of banksia,
which are in great abundance on this part of the coast.</p>
<p>They have been, and continue to be, on the best terms with the
settlers, although it may appear, that they acted with hostility
in the very beginning; but, by judicious management, the
incipient storm was averted, and a good understanding and
friendly feeling established, which has not yet been, nor likely
to be, interrupted.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* A few words of their language, which is much
more guttural than that of the Aborigines of the north coast,
will be found in the Appendix.]</p>
<p>On Sunday, December the 20th, we got under weigh, and at noon
left Princess Royal Harbour. Captain Barker accompanied us for
some distance. He and I parted with mutual regret; our friendship
having been cemented by a similarity of sentiments and
pursuits.</p>
<br>
<p>As this excellent officer and worthy man occupies so
conspicuous a place in the preceding narrative, I think it may
not be uninteresting to my readers to be informed of his untimely
death.</p>
<p>He was returning to Sydney from King George's Sound, which had
been given up to Captain Stirling, and, in obedience to orders
from the Colonial Government, he was examining the coast in the
vicinity of Encounter Bay, principally with the view of
ascertaining whether any available communication existed between
the River Murray (lately discovered by Captain Sturt) and the
sea. While in the execution of this duty, he was barbarously
murdered by the natives, and his mangled body thrown into the
sea.</p>
<p>The melancholy intelligence was communicated to me in a letter
from Dr. Davis, which having been mislaid, I transcribe the
minute account of the sad catastrophe given by Captain Sturt,**
from the relation of my fellow-traveller, Mr. Kent.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Vide "Sturt's Two Expeditions into the
Interior of Southern Australia", vol. ii. p. 239.]</p>
<br>
<blockquote>"I have remarked (observes Captain Sturt), that there
is a sand-hill to the eastward of the inlet (<i>i.e.</i> the
communication between Lake Alexandrina and the sea), under which
the tide runs strong, and the water is deep. Captain Barker
judged the breadth of the channel to be a quarter of a mile, and
he expressed a desire to swim across it to the sand-hill to take
bearings, and to ascertain the nature of the strand beyond it to
the eastward.<br>
<br>
"It unfortunately happened, that he was the only one of the party
who could swim well; in consequence of which, his people
remonstrated with him on the danger of making the attempt
unattended. Notwithstanding, however, that he was seriously
indisposed, he stript, and, after Mr. Kent had fastened his
compass on his head for him, he plunged into the water, and with
difficulty gained the opposite side; to effect which, took him
nine minutes and fifty-eight seconds. His anxious comrades saw
him ascend the hillock, and take several bearings; he then
descended the farther side, and was never seen by them again.<br>
<br>
"For a considerable time, Mr. Kent remained stationary, in
momentary expectation of his return; but, at length, taking the
two soldiers with him, he proceeded along the shore, in search of
wood for a fire. At about a quarter of a mile, the soldiers
stopped, and expressed their wish to return, as their minds
misgave them, and they feared that Captain Barker had met with
some accident. While conversing, they heard a distant shout, or
cry, which Mr. Kent thought resembled the call of the natives,
but which the soldiers positively declared to be the voice of a
white man. On their return to their companions, they asked if any
sounds had caught their ears, to which they replied in the
negative. The wind was blowing from the E.S.E., in which
direction Captain Barker had gone; and, to me, the fact of the
nearer party not having heard that which must have been his cries
for assistance, is satisfactorily accounted for, as, being
immediately under the hill, the sounds must have passed over
their heads, to be heard more distinctly at the distance at which
Mr. Kent and the soldiers stood. It is more than probable, that
while his men were expressing their anxiety about him, the
fearful tragedy was enacting, which it has become my painful task
to detail.<br>
<br>
"Evening closed in, without any signs of Captain Barker's return,
or any circumstance by which Mr. Kent could confirm his fears,
that he had fallen into the hands of the natives. For, whether it
was that the tribe which had shown such decided hostility to me,
when on the coast, had not observed the party, none made their
appearance; and, if I except two, who crossed the channel when
Mr. Kent was in search of wood, they had neither seen nor heard
any; and Captain Barker's enterprising disposition being well
known to his men, hopes were still entertained that he was safe.
A large fire was kindled, and the party formed a silent and
anxious group around it. Soon after nightfall, however, their
attention was roused by the sounds of the natives; and it was at
length discovered, that they had lighted a chain of small fires
between the sand-hill Captain Barker had ascended, and the
opposite side of the channel, around which their women were
chanting their melancholy dirge. It struck upon the ears of the
listeners with an ominous thrill, and assured them of the
certainty of the irreparable loss they had sustained. All night
did these dismal sounds echo along that lonely shore; but, as
morning dawned, they ceased, and Mr. Kent and his companions were
again left in anxiety and doubt. They at length, thought it most
advisable to proceed to the schooner, to advise with Dr. Davis.
They traversed the beach with hasty steps, but did not go on
board till the following day. It was then determined to procure
assistance from the sealers, on Kangaroo Island, as the only
means by which they could ascertain their leader's fate, and they
accordingly entered American Harbour. For a certain reward, one
of the men agreed to accompany Mr. Kent to the main, with a
native woman, to communicate with the tribe that was supposed to
have killed him. They landed at, or near the rocky point of
Encounter Bay, where they were joined by two other natives, one
of whom was blind. The woman was sent forward for intelligence,
and on her return gave the following details.<br>
<br>
"It appears that at a very considerable distance from the first
sand-hill, there is another, to which Captain Barker must have
walked, for the woman stated that three natives were going to the
shore from their tribe, and that they crossed his track. Their
quick perception immediately told them it was an unusual
impression. They followed upon it, and saw Captain Barker
returning. They hesitated for a long time to approach him, being
fearful of the instrument he carried. At length, however, they
closed upon him. Captain Barker tried to soothe them, but finding
that they were determined to attack him, he made for the water,
from which he could not have been very distant. One of the blacks
immediately threw his spear, and struck him in the hip. This did
not, however, stop him. He got among the breakers, when he
received the second spear in the shoulder. On this, turning round
he received a third full in the breast; with such deadly
precision do these savages cast their weapons. It would appear
that the third spear was already on its flight, when Captain
Barker turned, and it is to be hoped, that it was at once mortal.
He fell on his back into the water. The natives then rushed in,
and dragging him out by the legs, seized their spears, and
inflicted innumerable wounds upon his body; after which, they
threw it into deep water, and the sea tide carried it away.<br>
<br>
"From the same source from which the particulars of his death
were obtained, it was reported that the natives who perpetrated
the deed, were influenced by no other motive than curiosity to
ascertain if they had power to kill a white man. But we must be
careful in giving credit to this, for it is much more probable,
that the cruelties exercised by the sealers towards the blacks,
along the south coast, may have instigated the latter to take
vengeance on the innocent, as well as on the guilty.<br>
<br>
"Such, we have every reason to believe, was the untimely fate of
this amiable and talented man. Captain Barker was, in
disposition, as he was in the close of his life, in many
respects, similar to Captain Cook. Mild, affable, and attentive,
he had the esteem and regard of every companion, and the respect
of every one under him. Zealous in the discharge of his public
duties, honourable and just in private life; a lover and a
follower of science, indefatigable and dauntless in his pursuits;
a steady Mend, an entertaining companion; charitable,
kind-hearted, disinterested, and sincere.&mdash;In him the King
lost one of his most valuable officers, and his regiment one of
its most efficient members."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>I need scarcely observe, that I perfectly coincide in this
eulogy, and also in Captain Start's opinion, that my
much-lamented friend fell a victim to the undiscriminating
revenge of irritated savages.</p>
<p>To resume my narrative.&mdash;The wind was light, but
favourable. We observed Mount Gardener to be in longitude
118&deg; 20' 30", by chronometer from Swan River. On Tuesday
evening, December 22d, we were abreast of Termination Island,
within a quarter of a mile of the longitude assigned to it by
Vancouver,*** who thus named it, from its being the termination
of his researches on this coast. The weather was chilly and
disagreeable, the wind varying from E.S.E. to E.N.E. until the
25th, when it became westerly, and the weather fine.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Captains Flinders and King placed it farther
to the westward.]</p>
<p>On January the 2d, 1830, we entered Bass's Straits, the wind
blowing very gently from the westward. By cross bearings of Cape
Otway and King's Island, we were in longitude 143&deg; 53' 00",
while the chronometer from Swan River, according with several
lunar observations lately taken, showed 143&deg; 54' 15", which
may further prove, that the longitude assigned by us to Arthur's
Head, is pretty correct. The westerly wind continued to blow
gently, until Tuesday, the 5th of January, when, being close to
Curtis' Group, we were unfortunately caught by an easterly gale,
which commenced suddenly a little after midnight.</p>
<p>On Thursday the 7th, the gale continuing to blow with unabated
fury, without any appearance of the weather becoming more
moderate, it was resolved to bear away for Port Dalrymple, to
obtain a supply of provisions; which, there was reason to fear,
we should stand in need of, before reaching Sydney. We
accordingly did so, and towards evening came in sight of Van
Dieman's Land.</p>
<p>We had neither ascertained the latitude nor longitude, by
observation, since the commencement of the gale, and were
therefore uncertain as to our position; but, as several
individuals pointed out the entrance, we stood very close to the
shore, before it was discovered that we had made a mistake. We
then deemed it prudent to stretch out to sea; but, in consequence
of the heavy swell, and the wind having died away, we made very
little progress. In a short time, however, a land breeze sprang
up, and carried us out of danger.****</p>
<p class="foot">[**** The ship Portland was not so fortunate;
having been lately wrecked in this place, under similar
circumstances.]</p>
<p>During the night, we had an opportunity of ascertaining our
exact position, and made sail for Waterhouse Island, which we saw
at daylight, and then directed our course for the entrance of the
Tamar; on approaching which, a pilot came on board, and at eight,
<small>A.M.</small>, we anchored in a small cove, off George's
Town.</p>

the Inhabitants&mdash;Sail from Port Dalrymple&mdash;Arrival at

<p><small>NO</small> time was lost in entering into arrangements
for procuring a supply of provisions, which were much facilitated
by the Deputy-Assistant-Commissary General Hull, being at
George's Town.</p>
<p>The Commissary was to leave next morning, with Mr. Kenworthy,
Comptroller of Customs, who offered Lieutenant Sleeman and myself
a passage to Launceston, which we availed ourselves of, our own
boat being small, leaky, and unfit for a forty miles' excursion.
Accordingly, on Saturday morning, we started before daylight, for
the purpose of carrying the tide with us all the way.</p>
<p>As the morning dawned, the appearance of the river, and its
scenery, were singularly picturesque; each reach appearing like
an inland lake. In a reach, about seven miles above George's
Town, I observed a large ship at anchor, which I was informed was
the Surry, taking in Mimosa bark for London. I also learned, that
she was to sail in a few days for Sydney, to complete her cargo.
Captain Dacre, the commander, being an old friend, I determined
to proceed home by her, and therefore viewed her with some
interest.</p>
<p>Her present situation, protected from every breeze&mdash;her
shadow intermingled with that of the luxuriant foliage of the
surrounding verdant hills, reflected from the glassy bosom of the
tranquil lake,&mdash;formed a striking contrast, to that place of
peril she soon would be in, contending with the rude assaults of
stormy winds and waves, while passing those dreary
regions.&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="indent"><small>"&mdash;&mdash;where wild-meeting oceans
boil,<br>
                                  Besouth Magellan."</small></p>
<br>
<p>The sun rose beautifully over the eastern hills, and the
surrounding views became most interesting: at a point named
Whirlpool reach, the scenery much resembles that of the highland
lakes; but even this scenery is surpassed, at a spot named Swan
Reach; and at the point where Nelson's shoals open, the view is
truly magnificent, the distant hills, among which towers the
lofty Benlomond, presenting a prospect highly agreeable to all
who have any taste for the picturesque.</p>
<p>When within a short distance of Launceston, I noticed a
spruce-looking gentleman, whose face was not unknown to me,
guiding a boat, as I thought, rather awkwardly. We soon
recognized each other as former fellow-voyagers, and he took a
seat in our boat, which was better adapted for passengers than
his own.</p>
<p>The last time we met, he was captain of the light company of a
<i>crack</i> regiment of infantry. After mutual salutation, and
condolence on his part, I expressed my astonishment at his having
converted his sword into a plough-share: I also could not help
reminding him how he used to rail against any life excepting that
of a soldier, which (he thought) so far surpassed all others. He
had now his boat full of wheat, which he was conveying to "the
maid of the mill", to get ground. This was rather a different
employment from that of exhibiting the symmetry of his form, and
the smart cut of his coat, after parade, in the view of the
admiring fair. As regards dress, however, he had not degenerated
into that "agrestem et inhumanam negligentiam", so frequent among
those who have, in their earlier years, been celebrated for their
attention to the adorning of the outward man. He had also altered
his opinion regarding the relative importance of the soldier and
the firmer, and he now expatiated, with Ciceronian eloquence and
enthusiasm, on the pleasures of a country life.</p>
<p>Having arrived at Launceston about noon, through the kindness
of Mr. Hull, we got pretty well housed at a comfortable inn, and
instantly made arrangements for the disposal of the two days, we
intended to remain. Having a farm about thirty miles from
Launceston, which I had never seen, I purposed to embrace the
present opportunity of paying it a visit, and Lieutenant Sleeman
consented to accompany me.</p>
<p>The next day being Sunday, we went to church, where we heard a
very good sermon. In the afternoon, I received a friendly visit
from many old acquaintances. I was also much gratified, by
several prisoners, (who had come to the colony under my care, and
who were now in responsible situations,) calling to pay their
respects, and to express the sorrow they felt on hearing of my
shipwreck. It afforded me no small degree of pleasure to observe
the interest these unfortunate men seemed to take in my
welfare.</p>
<p>Next morning, at daylight, we were ready to take our intended
trip to the country; but after waiting some time for the gig, on
inquiry we found that Captain &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, the
innkeeper, would not let it come until he saw one of the party
requiring it, this put us in mind of the <i>nonchalance</i> of
the transatlantic innkeepers; and Lieutenant Sleeman, being
exceedingly wroth and indignant, threatened to punish the fellow
for his insolence; however, there was no remedy, as it was the
only gig to be hired in the place, and if we had shown any airs,
it was unlikely we should get it. I therefore, presented myself,
roused Captain Boniface from his slumbers, and by a little
<i>blandiloquentia</i>, the gig was soon got ready, and away we
started to take a view of the country.</p>
<p>We were not armed, by the advice of Captain Donaldson, the
Commandant, although a bushranger named Bevan (free, and a native
of Sydney) was abroad, and in the vicinity, committing great
depredations with impunity; doubtless being sheltered by those
pests of society, receivers of "swag", the phrase for plunder, in
the jargon of thieves, rogues, and vagabonds.</p>
<p>There was also some danger to be apprehended from the natives,
who were now committing several cruel acts of retaliation, which
their extermination seemed to be the only means of stopping. This
is the more to be regretted, as the natives, at first, were
friendly disposed, and appeared mild and affable; their hostility
being caused by the rash and imprudent conduct of certain
civilized individuals.</p>
<p>At the first formation of the colony (observes Mr. Evans*),
Lieutenant Gov. Bowen having left Risdon, on a tour through the
Island, to ascertain the spots of land most eligible to be formed
into allotments for settlers, the command devolved upon an
officer of the New South Wales Corps. Towards noon of the day,
after the Lieutenant Governor's departure, a considerable number
of natives were seen descending from the neighbouring hills; and
as they approached, they were distinctly heard to sing, each man
having in his hand a green bough, a well known emblem of peace
among savage tribes. Perhaps their signals of amity were not
understood, or their numbers appeared too great to be trusted;
otherwise the officer in command, would not have directed a
discharge of grape and canister shot to be made among them.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Description of Van Dieman's Land, by G. W.
Evans, Esq., Deputy Surveyor-General.]</p>
<p>Several instances have lately occurred, where opportunities of
regaining the confidence of the Aborigines, thus lost through the
lamentable rashness of the first settlers, might have been
profited by; but instead of this being the case, every hostile
feeling has been aggravated by the treacherous and barbarous
conduct of their white antagonists.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** Since this period the Aborigines have been
collected, and removed to an Island in Bass's Straits, where they
are provided for, and protected by the Colonial Government.]</p>
<p>We passed through an exceedingly fertile, and well-cultivated
country, and arrived at Perth, a rising town, situated on the
right hank of the South Esk, about twelve miles from Launceston.
We crossed the river in a very convenient punt, and halted at the
Government House, where, through the kindness of Captain
Donaldson, we found an excellent breakfast in readiness for
us.</p>
<p>This repast being finished, we renewed our journey; and, after
travelling about fifteen, miles, through a pastoral-looking
country, chiefly belonging to Mr. Archer, an opulent settler, we
arrived at Mr. Alston's, who received us with unfeigned
cordiality. After mutual gratulations, he informed me, that
nothing could have happened more opportunely than my present
visit, as an influential individual was endeavouring to deprive
me of my farm, with the view, and in the hope, of getting it
added to his own possessions. I was somewhat surprised at this
information, and thought it prudent to lose no time in adopting
measures to thwart his design.</p>
<p>Next morning, we were awakened, at early dawn, by the pleasing
song of the magpie (which is far from being an indifferent
substitute for the lark), and being provided with horses by Mr.
Alston, who accompanied us, we started, to take a view of the
surrounding country, but more especially of my property, which we
soon reached; and the scenery surpassed my most sanguine
anticipations.</p>
<p>At this season of the year, the mornings, in Van Dieman's
Land, are generally delightful;&mdash;this one was particularly
so; and we enjoyed the contemplation of nature, in her mild and
peaceful aspect, much more keenly, from having lately been
compelled to view her under less attractive forms:&mdash;it was
certainly far more pleasant to listen to the soothing and gentle
sough of the autumnal breeze, waving o'er the yellow bending
grain, than to hear the stormy winds whistling wildly through the
shrouds, in dismal concert with the clamour of the crew, the
rattling of the ropes, and the hoarse voice of conflicting
waves.</p>
<p>On our return to Mr. Alston's, we found Boniface's Bucephalus
ready caparisoned, and being refreshed by rest and good
treatment, quite willing to carry us back to Launceston. Having
no time to lose, we dismounted, entered the gig, bade adieu to
our hospitable friend (who promised to make the necessary
improvements on my farm), and proceeded on our return, repeating,
"<i>Beatus ille qui procul negotiis</i>." After a pleasant drive,
we arrived at Perth in safety, being neither disturbed by blacks
nor bushrangers, and immediately sat down to an excellent tiffin,
and a choice assortment of fruit, which the Serjeant had in
readiness.</p>
<p>We reached Launceston just in time to dine with the Magnates.
A ball took place in the evening. The <i>arbiter elegantiarum</i>
was Captain Welch, who seemed as much at home in the duties of
that important station, as he was in laying down the beacons and
buoys in the river Tamar.</p>
<p>The assemblage of the fair sex was numerous and respectable;
and the healthy aspects, blooming cheeks, and expressive eyes, of
the young damsels (who, considering it was the first time some of
them had appeared in public, conducted themselves with becoming
gracefulness and ease), shewed that the soil was as well adapted
for the development of female beauty, as it is universally
allowed to be for the growth of grain.</p>
<p>The supper was well "got up"; and, in short, the entire
arrangements did credit to the taste and judgment of the
stewards. If I mistake not, this is the first instance of a
subscription ball in any part of this colony, and therefore
highly praiseworthy; as the cheerful intercourse of a dance
(while used as an occasional relaxation, and not as the important
business of life,) is not only harmless, but even likely to do
good, by tending to promote that social, and friendly
intercourse, which, unfortunately, is so little regarded in these
colonies.</p>
<p>Launceston is flourishing, and likely to increase in
prosperity, as large ships are now enabled to come up to the
wharf. I noticed several of considerable size; one upwards of 400
tons. There is no doubt that it will become a place of great
trade, although I cannot agree with those who predict that it
will, ere long, surpass Hobart Town. It is badly supplied with
water, which might be obtained abundantly, and without great
labour, skill, or expense, from the South Esk, above the
falls&mdash;not half a mile from the town.</p>
<p>Next morning, we left Launceston; and, being engaged to spend
some part of the day with an old friend, we crossed the North
Esk, mounted horses, and shortly arrived at his farm, which is
pleasantly situated on the right bank of the Tamar. After having
viewed and praised his improvements, and partaken of a
well-cooked dinner, we took our departure, and proceeded down the
river in Mr. Kenworthy's barge, accompanied by Captain Donaldson,
and Mr. Lockyer.</p>
<p>Having imprudently tarried too long at dinner, the tide failed
us, and we were obliged to stop during the night, at the
residence of a settler, an old sailor, named Guilders***. We were
under some alarm of a visit from the
Bushrangers;&mdash;particularly Captain Donaldson, against whom,
they had vowed vengeance; consequently, we did not enjoy much
sleep, and at dawn of day, we renewed our journey. At five,
<small>A.M.</small>, we called alongside the ship Surry, and had
coffee. Captain Dacre received me with a hearty welcome, and
offered me a passage to England, on exceedingly favourable terms,
which I immediately embraced.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Since treacherously murdered by the
natives.]</p>
<p>On Friday, the 15th, at six, <small>P.M.</small>, we got under
weigh, and left George's Town.**** On Saturday, we encountered a
heavy gale, accompanied with much thunder and lightning. On the
19th, we made Cape Howe; then coasted along the shore, and on
Thursday, Jan. 21st, at daylight, we entered the heads of Port
Jackson, and shortly afterwards anchored in Sydney Cove, when I
was surrounded by many friends, whose disinterested and
substantial kindness will never be forgotten.</p>
<p class="foot">[**** George's Town, situated on the right bank
of the river, near its mouth, is rapidly going to decay; but it
may revive, and, from its proximity to the sea, &amp;c., become
the Margate of the <i>Launcestonians</i>.]</p>
<p>In a few days afterwards, I proceeded on a tour through the
Counties Cumberland, Camden, Argyle, Murray, St. Vincent,
Bathurst, &amp;c.; and, although only twelve months had elapsed
since my last visit, the improvements on the various farms were
really astonishing, and reflected infinite credit on the
perseverance and enterprise of the settlers;&mdash;of those
especially, who had given up ploughing the waves, for the more
placid occupation of ploughing the land. Indeed, I may state,
without much fear of contradiction, that; with few exceptions,
the farms, and flocks, and herds, of <i>ci-devant</i> sailors,
are better managed than those of any other class of settlers.</p>
<p>On returning from my excursion, I found that the Surry had
arrived, but at the same time I heard the disagreeable
intelligence that the crew had left her, in consequence (as they
said) of her being very leaky, and totally unfit to undertake a
voyage round Cape Horn, during the winter season. I was strongly
advised not to proceed in her; but, being anxious to get home,
and being assured by Captain Dacre, who was an experienced
seaman, and one who well knew whether or not any real cause
existed for apprehension, that the report, which was exaggerated,
had been spread from malicious motives, I unhesitatingly
embarked, in the full hope that this, my second attempt to reach
England, would be successful.</p>
<p>On the 9th of April, the Surry being again manned, and having
completed her cargo, we left Sydney Cove. As soon as we cleared
the heads of Port Jackson, we encountered a heavy gale from the
southward, which blew with unabated fury for several days; and,
notwithstanding the reported crazy state of the vessel, she made
no more water than any other merchant-ship, under similar
circumstances, would have done.</p>
<p>The weather continuing stormy, and the wind still hanging to
the southward, we passed to the northward of New Zealand; after
which, we experienced fine weather, and a northerly breeze, which
lasted many days.</p>
<p>On the 28th, we passed the sub-meridian of Greenwich, in
latitude 35&deg; 42'. On the 29th of May, we passed a small piece
of ice, in lat. 58&deg; 30' and long. 118&deg; 12' W. This
unexpected sight caused us much uneasiness, as we hitherto
understood that, during the winter season, in these high
latitudes, no danger was to be apprehended from, icebergs, which
were only to be met with during summer, when, from the length of
the days, they could easily be avoided. Thus finding, however,
that the above generally-received opinion was erroneous, our
anxiety was greatly increased and not without reason; as it
neither can be considered safe nor agreeable, to be scudding
under a close-reefed main-topsail, during a long, dark, cold, and
stormy night, in continual dread of being dashed to pieces
against an iceberg.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* During my voyage home, in the following year,
in the ship John, from Van Dieman's Land, we had a very narrow
escape from a peril of this description.<br>
<br>
On August 7th, being in latitude 52&deg; 58' S. and longitude
130&deg; E., about four o'clock in the morning, the chief mate
having reported to the Captain, that there was a suspicious
appearance on the starboard bow, the Captain called me up to ask
my opinion, and I distinctly saw the <i>blink</i> of the ice; but
as the ship was going with much rapidity, it soon
disappeared;-being on the alert from this circumstance, the
Captain remained on the poop, and the chief mate on the
forecastle, and in about an hour, a heavy cloud was perceived
right a-head, through the surrounding haze, which was thought to
be land. During these surmises, the chief mate called out "keep
her away", which was done instantly, and we grazed the S.W. point
of an immense iceberg, several hundred feet high; the rebounding
swell from which assisted to keep the vessel off, while the
broken ice retarded her progress considerably. We then stood off
till daylight, when we observed a great number of icebergs around
us in every direction. We sailed through them, during six days,
lying-to every night, until we reached 118&deg; west
longitude.<br>
<br>
Since this period, icebergs have constantly been met with during
the winter season&mdash;generally from 130&deg; to 110&deg; west;
and I have, therefore, no doubt, that a large extent of
undiscovered land exists to the southward.]</p>
<p>Fortunately, we met no more; but shortly afterwards the
weather became overcast, and we did not see the sun for several
days; when we obtained a meridian altitude, it placed us a degree
and a half to the southward of our reckoning, thereby shewing
that a current runs in that direction.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** It has often astonished me, that navigators
do not make more use of the moon. In none of the popular works on
navigation (Kerrigan's excepted), is there any problem given to
find the apparent time by the altitude of the moon&mdash;a simple
problem, exceedingly useful on many occasions (more particularly
in high latitudes during the winter season) and now rendered more
easy, by the right ascension of the moon being calculated for
every three hours, in the Nautical Almanack.]</p>
<p>On the 30th we saw the Island of Diego Ramirez; After passing
Cape Horn, we were baffled with light northerly winds for several
days, experiencing at the same time a north-easterly current.</p>
<p>On the 26th of June, in latitude 29&deg; 34', and in longitude
15&deg; 54', we got the S.E. trade. On the 9th of July we crossed
the equator, in longitude 21&deg; 41'. On the 20th, we got the
N.E. trade; and after a protracted, but not otherwise
disagreeable passage, the good ship Surry, notwithstanding the
unfavourable surmises, anchored in safety in the Downs, on August
2d, at two <small>P.M.</small>, without the aid of a pilot, as it
blew such a heavy gale, that none dared to venture on board.</p>
<p>Thus did I complete another voyage round the world, during
which I experienced some dangers, many privations, and great
pecuniary loss&mdash;not having been insured, although a former
similar calamity might have taught me to act more prudently.</p>
<p>It, however, affords me much gratification, in being enabled
to state, that my losses, on both occasions, were rendered less
severe, by the kind and liberal conduct of the Commissioners of
His Majesty's Navy, who, unhesitatingly, granted me every
indulgence which they could bestow.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h4>BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE INHABITANTS OF MURRAY'S ISLAND.</h4>
<br>
<p align="center"><small><small>(ALLUDED TO IN PAGE 11.)</small></small></p>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> inhabitants of Murray's Island are totally
distinct from any of the Aborigines of New Holland, to whom, in
every respect, they are far superior; but they have the character
of being very treacherous, daring, and deceitful. Horsburgh, in
his Directory, cautions voyagers to be on their guard, in their
intercourse with the natives of the numerous Islands in Torres
Straits, particularly with those of Murray's Island.</p>
<p>I touched there several years ago, and remained two days,
during which, I had unreserved intercourse with the natives, whom
I found to be, like all other savages, prone to thieving, but
otherwise not evil disposed. I made some observations at the
time, which, with other manuscripts, &amp;c., were lost in the
Governor Ready, and I therefore give the following imperfect
sketch from memory.</p>
<p>On the 25th of June, 1822, I sailed from Sydney, in the ship
Richmond, in company with the Mary Anne and Almorah. On the 11th
of July, the three ships passed through the Great Barrier reef in
safety, and anchored off Murray's Island. An immense number of
natives were observed running along the shore; and, as we
imagined, from their gestures, earnestly inviting us to land.
Shortly after we anchored, a boat from each ship was manned, and
the three Commanders and myself proceeded on shore; on
approaching which, the natives, who had waded out a considerable
distance, surrounded the boats, shouting, "<i>War&#275;ka,
War&#275;ka</i>", "<i>Mabouse</i>", and "<i>puta, puta</i>", with
great vociferation, and holding out bows and arrows, clubs,
tortoise-shell, cocoa nuts, plantains, &amp;c., calling, at the
same time, "<i>torre, torre</i>."</p>
<p>There could not be less than three hundred of the natives in
the water, and on the shore. They treated our Lascars with utter
contempt, and the Lascars did not seem particularly anxious to
cultivate their acquaintance.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Our friend Bongaree (observes Captain
Flinders) could not understand anything of their language; nor
did they pay much attention to him. He seemed, indeed, to feel
his own inferiority, and made but a poor figure amongst
them.]</p>
<p>An active barter soon commenced. The natives would not permit
their commodities out of their hands, until they had possession
of what they considered an equivalent; but, as we gave them our
articles to inspect, without hesitation, they soon laid aside
their mistrust. This caution, on their part, shows that they must
have been cheated, in former dealings with Europeans. Old knives,
and old iron hoops straightened, and cut into pieces of six or
eight inches in length, were first brought into the market, and
were exchanged to great advantage. But the tomahawks and axes,
which had been reserved as superior articles of traffic, and
concealed in the bottom of the boat, were all stolen by the
natives, at the same time that they were apparently propitiating
the muskets, which were in the stem-sheets, by placing green
leaves on the locks, and repeating, in a conciliating tone,
"<i>puta, puta</i>." One, who was detected, <i>flagrante
delicto</i>, ran on shore,&mdash;the others clearing a way for
him&mdash;and, although instantly pursued, he got dear off with
his much-valued prize. This incident, however, did not disturb
the general tranquillity; but afterwards, iron hoops were at a
discount.</p>
<p>The barter being concluded, three of us went on shore, and the
natives immediately selected the tallest of the party, whom,
being like Saul among the people, they considered to be chief,
and he was laid hold of by two powerful savages, who placed their
arms in his, and thus escorted him through the assembled
multitude. In proceeding along, the natives who were nearest us
endeavoured to place leaves between the flints and the pans of
our pistols and fowling-pieces, still repeating, "<i>puta,
puta</i>."</p>
<p>After having walked a short distance along the beach, we met a
group of women and children, and were somewhat chagrined by the
children running from us, screaming, and clinging to their
mothers, who, together with the men, laughed heartily at the
fears we occasioned. The women stood aloof, and I, therefore,
notwithstanding the admonitions of my companions, went forward to
them; and, imagining that, where no rudeness is intended, there
is seldom offence taken, I selected the prettiest-looking damsel,
to whom I presented some trifling articles, which she willingly
accepted. I then placed a handkerchief round her neck, gave her a
small looking glass, and, at the same time, a gentle tap under
the chin. Immediately, a simultaneous shout arose from the
surrounding throng, in which I cordially joined, and imitated all
their gesticulations as well as I could, to their evident delight
and satisfaction.</p>
<p>We then took a walk through the town, and viewed their houses,
which are built of bamboo, and thatched, and are exceedingly neat
and clean. During our ramble, we observed several men labouring
under <i>elephantiasis</i>, who were apparently confined in a
space, enclosed with strong wicker-work, upwards of ten feet
high. We also noticed several others, afflicted with a still more
loathsome disease.</p>
<p>One of the natives, named Madi&#275;a, whom we had dressed in
a shirt and trowsers, now came, and, pointing to the setting sun,
and to the ships, gave us to understand, that it was time for us
to go on board; while others were using their best endeavours to
persuade us to stay&mdash;it was imagined, for no very friendly
purpose. Be that as it may, our officious friend insisted on our
departure, by pulling us towards the boats which, since our
landing, were lying out of the reach of the natives, and we
thought it prudent to comply with his wishes. After having
touched noses with him, we entered the boat, which drew near for
us;&mdash;the other two keeping off, to be able to act in case of
treachery. We, however, parted in peace, and pulled towards the
ships, with the boats pretty well laden with the natural and
artificial productions of the Island, which, even taking our
losses by theft into consideration, we had obtained at a very
cheap rate.</p>
<p>Next morning, as the wind blew rather freshly, and the sky was
completely obscured, and, consequently, not favourable for us to
thread our intricate way through the Straits, it was deemed
prudent to remain at anchor; and I therefore embraced the
opportunity of accompanying Captain Warrington on a
boat-excursion to the small adjacent islands, on one of which we
landed, and walked to a village, formed exactly like that at
Murray's Island. We did not meet with any inhabitants, but, as
everything appeared neat and clean, we concluded, that it could
not have been long deserted. On looking into the largest hut, we
observed it filled with human skulls; and various were our
conjectures, as to whether they had belonged to friends or foes.
I felt a strong inclination to take one or two of them, but, from
fear of giving offence, I refrained from doing so.</p>
<p>While continuing our stroll at our ease, we were startled by a
confused sound of voices; and, on looking round, we beheld a
number of natives wading through the channel (which separates
this from the other small island), waving their hands, and making
a hideous noise; and, at the same time, we observed a large
canoe, under full sail, filled with men, from Murray's Island,
standing towards us. We therefore thought it prudent to get into
the boat without delay, as we were several miles from assistance,
had we stood in need of it. One of the boat's crew, whom we had
missed, now came running to the beach, with a skull under his
arm. Captain Warrington, who was exceedingly vexed at this
imprudence, ordered the fellow to take it back to the place he
had stolen it from; but, the natives being close at his heels, he
threw the skull on the sand, plunged into the water, and reached
the boat.</p>
<p>Having shoved off a little, we lay on our oars, and
endeavoured, as well as we could, to explain to them, that the
individual who had acted so reprehensibly, should be punished.
They appeared pacified, and made signs for us to land; but, as
the canoe was fast approaching, and as we had committed a
fault&mdash;perhaps desecrated one of their holy places&mdash;we
declined accepting their apparently earnest invitation. We
therefore made sail, and kept as close to the wind as we could,
that we might weather the canoe, which was now drawing very near.
We succeeded in doing so; and, notwithstanding the clamorous
endeavours of the natives to entice us on board, kept our luff,
and invited them to accompany us to the ships, where they would
be liberally supplied with <i>torr&egrave;</i>. They followed us
for some time, but, not being able to draw to windward (although,
with the wind abaft the beam, the canoe sailed far better than
our gig), they made for the shore, and we reached the shipping
without any accident.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** "Their canoes (observes Captain Flinders)
have two masts opposite to each other, and a sail extended
between them; but when going with a side wind, the lee mast is
brought aft by a backstay, and the sail then stands obliquely. In
other words, they brace up by setting in the head of the lee
mast, and perhaps the foot also; and can then lie within seven
points of the wind, and possibly nearer. No boats could have been
manoeuvred better, in working to windward , than were these long
canoes, by the naked savages.]</p>
<p>During the day, great numbers of the natives were on the
beach, and in the water, making all possible signs for us to come
on shore, but none of them came on board. We saw no canoes,
which, it appeared, were kept only on the south-west side of the
Island.</p>
<p>After dinner, three boats (one from each ship), with the same
party, well-armed, in case of accidents, went on shore. The
native (Madi&#275;a), who had evinced so much anxiety for our
departure last night, was perceived standing on the beach, apart
from the multitude, and dressed in his shirt and trowsers. As
soon as we approached sufficiently near, his wife having
previously assisted in divesting him of all incumbrance, he
plunged into the water, swam off to us, and entered the boat
without fear: on the contrary, he jumped on the stem-sheets, and,
both by gesture and speech, assumed a superiority over the
others, who were now, in great numbers, crowding around us.
Whether the authority this native assumed was occasioned by our
notice of him, we could not ascertain; but his endeavours to
preserve the peace certainly tended to check the rude impetuosity
and forwardness of the mob.</p>
<p>Barter soon commenced, but was not carried on so briskly as it
was yesterday, in consequence of the natives preferring axes and
tomahawks to old iron hoops, and our not being well supplied with
the former articles. The natives, however, had entirely laid
aside suspicion, and they freely permitted us to examine the
articles which they wished to exchange, without requiring prior
possession of the desired equivalent.</p>
<p>Having obtained all that I wished to possess, I went on shore
with the native (Madi&#275;a), who had, apparently, from the
beginning of our intercourse, taken me under his protection, and
accompanied him to the village, where he formally introduced me
to another native, who, after a speech of considerable length,
which I did not understand, but judged to be friendly, advanced
towards me, and touched my nose with his. I therefore concluded,
that this ceremony was in token of mutual amity, and explained to
them that our mode of expressing friendship was by shaking hands,
which they then did very heartily.</p>
<p>These two natives were well made men, considerably above the
middle size, in whose fine open, but resolute countenances, I
could not perceive the least indications of treachery. I
therefore sat down beside them, and was not long in making an
attempt to obtain some knowledge of their language. I had much
trouble in making them understand my meaning; but, after this
difficulty was removed, I obtained a pretty large vocabulary,
comprehending the various parts of the body, and also all other
objects within sight. I presented them with one copy, with their
own language in one column, and the English in the other, which I
told them to show to any other strangers who might hereafter pay
them a visit. The other copy, as already mentioned, was
unfortunately lost, and I can only call to mind the following few
words:&mdash;"<i>War&#275;ka</i>", or "<i>War&#275;ga</i>", peace
or welcome; "<i>mabouse</i>", come to us; "<i>puta,
puta</i>",&mdash;I could not satisfactorily make out the
signification of this word, but imagined it meant&mdash;no
danger, or, don't be afraid; "<i>torre</i>", iron;
"<i>casse</i>", give; "<i>Girgir</i>" the sun; "<i>Kimiar</i>",
men; "<i>Koskarail</i>", women; "<i>Madi&#275;a</i>,
<i>Ouc&#257;ra</i>, <i>Wamaia</i>, <i>Wag&#275;ra</i>", proper
names of men.</p>
<p>Our grammatical exercises being finished, and being joined by
many others, who had concluded their barter, we commenced a
variety of gymnastic amusements, which were carried on with
uninterrupted good humour. We had rather the advantage of the
natives in wrestling, but they far surpassed us in archery; in
short, it was absurd to make a comparison, nor could we help
feeling mortification at our great inferiority in this respect,
being so apparent: indeed, the most experienced and skilful
modern European archers would have cut but a very sorry figure
among these athletic savages, whose amazing feats could not have
been surpassed by the English archers of olden times.*** Their
astonishing adroitness can only be attributed to their being
accustomed to this exercise from their early youth. We noticed
the boys&mdash;some of them very young&mdash;amusing themselves,
shooting with bows and arrows, suited to their strength.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** The depth (observes Captain Flinders, in
describing the attack these savages made on two English vessels,)
to which the arrows penetrated into the decks and sides of the
ship was represented as truly astonishing.]</p>
<p>With respect to their warlike instruments and canoes, I cannot
do better than insert the following very accurate description,
given in Captain Flinders's Introduction to his "Voyage to Terra
Australis", which equally applies to the natives of Murray's, as
to those of Darnley's Island, whom I believe to be the same
people.</p>
<p>"Their arms were bows, arrows, and clubs, which they bartered
for every kind of iron work with eagerness; but appeared to set
little value on anything else. The bows are made of split bamboo,
and so strong, that no man in the ship could bend one of them.
The string is a broad slip of cane, fixed to one end of the bow,
and fitted with a noose, to go over the other end, when strung.
The arrow is a cane, of about four feet long, into which a
pointed piece of the hard, heavy, <i>casuarina</i> wood is firmly
and neatly fitted; and some of them are barbed. Their clubs are
made of the <i>casuarina</i>, and are powerful weapons. The hand
part is indented, and has a small knob, by which the firmness of
the grasp is much assisted; and the heavy end is usually carved
with some device.</p>
<p>"Their canoes are about fifty feet in length, and appear to
have been hollowed out of a single tree; but the pieces which
form the gunwales, are planks, sewed on with the cocoa nut, and
secured with pegs. These vessels are low forward, but rise abaft;
and, being narrow, are fitted with an outrigger on each side, to
keep them steady. A raft, of greater length than the canoe,
extends over about half the length; and upon this, is fixed a
shed, or hut, thatched with palm leaves.</p>
<p>"These people, in short, appeared to be dexterous sailors, and
formidable warriors."</p>
<p>The natives, in general, are tall, well made, and muscular
men. They are of a dark chocolate colour, and possess intelligent
countenances; their features more resembling those of Europeans,
than those of any other savages I have met with. The males go
entirely naked; but the females, even the youngest, wear a
covering, from the waist to the knees.</p>
<p>They are exceedingly numerous. We counted upwards of three
hundred at one time, and Captain Flinders states, that, including
women and children, the inhabitants of Murray's Island must
amount to about seven hundred; but, although the island seems
very fertile (and the shores abound in fish and turtle) yet, as
it is not more than two miles in length, and one in breadth, it
may fairly be presumed, that it cannot support so large a
population;* and it is my belief, that many of the natives whom
we observed here, belonged to Darnley's, Warrior's, and other
neighbouring Islands, and even to New Guinea&mdash;communication
being easily effected by means of their large canoes, in the
management of which they are extremely dexterous.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Murray's Island has been considered, on many
accounts, a very eligible spot to occupy. I perfectly agree as to
its eligibility; more particularly if the abandoned British
settlements, on the north coast of New Holland, should ever be
resumed; but, from the warlike disposition of the natives, I
doubt whether a sufficient number of soldiers could be spared
from head-quarters to keep possession of it.]</p>
<p>At sunset, we left the shore, and gave the natives to
understand that they would not see us again. Madiea wept
bitterly, which we thought rather extraordinary, as a two days'
acquaintanceship rarely produces such a display of affection. We
invited him to accompany us, and he willingly did so, and jumped
into the boat. The assembled natives remonstrated with him, as we
imagined, on his thus leaving his friends, and his native land;
but, notwithstanding their entreaties, he persisted in going with
us, which he did to a considerable distance, when, being overcome
by the lamentations of the females, he lost heart, jumped
overboard, and swam ashore to his companions.</p>
<p>We then stood up in the boats, and gave three farewell cheers,
which were cordially and loudly returned by the natives, from
whom we thus parted on the most friendly terms. During our
intercourse, we behaved towards them with the greatest prudence
and good humour, and endeavoured, as far as we could, to
cultivate their friendship, for the advantage of those who might,
through shipwreck, be at their mercy; and I have every reason to
believe, that our conduct has been attended with good results, as
I have heard of several shipwrecked people, who, since our visit,
have been treated by them with great kindness and
hospitality.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** Ships, on their way from Sydney to India,
occasionally touch here, for the purpose of bartering for
tortoiseshell, and the natives come off to the ships without
fear. Dr. Rutherford, who visited Murray's Island in 1833, has
furnished the "United Service Journal" with an interesting
account of the inhabitants, &amp;c. &amp;c.]</p>
<p>Next morning, at daylight, we got under weigh, and proceeded
on our voyage, passing safely through Torres Straits, when the
ships parted company. In a few days afterwards, the ship
Richmond, in which I was a passenger, was totally lost on a coral
reef, in the Java sea, and all the curiosities I had collected at
Murray's Island were left to the Malays, whose proas were
approaching the wreck in great numbers, when our former consort,
the Almorah, providentially hove in sight, and rescued us from
our perilous situation.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX, No. [IV.]</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>REMARKS ON TRANSPORTATION,<br>
&amp;c. &amp;c.</h4>
<br>
<p><small>AS</small> the subject may not be unacceptable to some
of my readers, I shall make a few observations relative to
convict ships,&mdash;the management of prisoners during the
voyage, and their disposal and treatment in New South Wales, and
Van Dieman's Land.</p>
<p>On the requisition of the Secretary of State for the Home
Department, the Lords of the Admiralty give public notice, that
tenders for ships of a certain size (usually from 400 to 600
tons), to convey a given number of prisoners (generally from 200
to 300), to New South Wales, or Van Dieman's Land, will be
received on a specified day. There is considerable competition,
which, of course, has the effect of reducing the rate of freight.
The lowest apparent tender, however, is not always accepted, as
it occasionally happens, that, from peculiarity of construction,
a vessel of less registered tonnage will afford greater
accommodation, and, consequently, convey a greater number of
prisoners than one of larger burden.</p>
<p>Before the tender is accepted, the vessel is carefully
surveyed by competent officers, who use every means to ascertain
that she is seaworthy, and, in all respects, properly adapted for
the service she is about to be employed in. If the report be
favourable, the vessel is engaged, and proceeds, without delay,
to Deptford, to be fitted for the reception of the prisoners. The
interior arrangements are done by contract, at the expense of
Government, and under the superintendence of responsible
officers; while the owners of the vessel are required to furnish
her amply with every thing fit and needful for such a voyage,
during which she must be manned with seven men and a boy, to
every 100 tons register-measurement. It may, therefore, be
inferred, that ships employed in this service are exceedingly
well equipped.</p>
<p>When the vessel is nearly ready for the reception of the
prisoners, application is made for a guard, which consists of
thirty men of a regiment under orders for Sydney. Formerly, a
guard of fifty men was considered requisite, when the prisoners
amounted to 300; but it now never exceeds thirty, however great
the number may be.* As soon as the guard embarks, the ship sails
either for Woolwich, Sheerness, Portsmouth, Cork, or Dublin, to
receive the prisoners.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Last year (1834), I had charge of 400
prisoners (the greatest number sent in one ship), without any
additional guard.]</p>
<p>The expense of transportation, of late years, has been greatly
diminished; insomuch, that, calculating the freight, provisions,
superintendence, and, in short, every contingency, the amount for
each individual does not exceed &pound;14.</p>
<p>Various systems have been adopted in the transportation of
convicts. In the first instance, the owners of the transport
supplied provisions, medicines, medical attendance, &amp;c., for
a certain sum per head; but the mortality being so excessive
while this system was in operation, other arrangements were
deemed necessary, and Government determined to provide
everything; by which salutary change the comfort of the
prisoners, during the voyage, is rendered superior to that of any
steerage-passenger.</p>
<p>The Master of the vessel has the same allowances, in the issue
of provisions, as the Purser of a man-of-war. He also receives,
as a reward for humane conduct, a gratuity of &pound;50; and,
should the vessel convey female convicts, the first mate receives
&pound;20, and the second and third mates &pound;15 each, from
Government, on their producing a certificate from the Surgeon
Superintendent that they have conducted themselves to his
satisfaction.</p>
<p>The individual, appointed by the Admiralty as Surgeon and
Superintendent, is always a surgeon of the Royal Navy, of some
standing, on whom the entire management and responsibility, as
regards the convicts, rest. His duty is exceedingly varied and
extensive; he being required, not only to officiate as physician,
surgeon, and apothecary, but also as clergyman, school-master,
justice of the peace, inspector of provisions, &amp;c.
&amp;c.</p>
<p>His emoluments are&mdash;full naval-pay, half a guinea for
each prisoner landed in health, &pound;15 to defray his expenses
in the colony, and &pound;100 to pay his passage home. His time
is also allowed, as if he were serving in a man-of-war, until his
arrival in England, provided he embraces the first favourable
opportunity of returning home.</p>
<p>I shall give a brief statement of my method of conducting
affairs, which, with little variation, may be considered as the
usual routine observed in convict ships. As soon as the prisoners
are received on board, they are placed in their berths, according
to a progressive number given to each individual; their bedding,
wearing, apparel, &amp;c., being also marked with a corresponding
number, so that confusion and pilfering may be prevented. They
are then divided into messes (six in each), the head of each
being answerable for the cleanliness, &amp;c. of the utensils,
and the regularity and comfort of the mess. Cooks are chosen from
those among them who have been sailors, or accustomed to the sea;
and others (I prefer the greatest rogues) are placed in
authority, to preserve order and decorum in the prison, which
they in general do very effectually.</p>
<p>As soon as we leave the land, the prisoners are freed from
irons, and permitted to be on deck, from morning till evening;
and these indulgences are continued during their good behaviour,
which generally lasts, from the beginning to the end of the
voyage.</p>
<p>Six months' supply of provisions is placed on board; every
article of food is of the best quality, and issued in sufficient
quantity, as the following Government scale of <i>daily</i> allowance
will show.</p>

<p>And <i>weekly</i>, whether fresh or salt meat is issued,
vinegar, not exceeding one quart for each mess of six persons,
and to the guards, not exceeding one half pint per man a
week.</p>
<p>The Master is required to supply the Surgeon (taking his
receipts for the same) with lemon-juice and sugar, to be issued
to the respective classes of persons on board, at his discretion,
as medical comforts, not exceeding one ounce of each article, per
day, to each individual.</p>
<p>And each convict, or settler, male or female, and children, is
allowed two gallons of wine during the voyage.</p>
<p>The wives of the guards are served with half the allowance
granted to their husbands; and their children one quarter of that
allowance. Children, above ten years of age, are victualled as
adults.</p>
<p>On the days on which flour is ordered to be issued, suet and
raisins, or currants, are substituted for one fourth part of the
flour, one half in suet, and the other half of the said fourth
part in fruit.</p>
<p>One pound of raisins being considered equal to one pound of
flour.</p>
<p>Half a pound of currants, ditto.</p>
<p>Half a pound of suet, ditto.</p>
<br>
<p>The provisions are cooked carefully, ant regular
intervals&mdash;breakfast, at half-past one <small>P.M.</small>,
and supper, at five <small>P.M.</small></p>
<p>In the distribution of the lime juice, water, sugar, and wine,
and issued about a fortnight after we leave England, daily at
eleven <small>A.M.</small>, and at four <small>P.M.</small>, each
prisoner answers to his name, comes aft to the windward gangway,
receives and drinks his allowance, passes the quarter-deck, and
then walks forward on the other side. In this manner, every
individual comes under my personal inspection at least twice a
day; an object of no small importance, in the preservation of
order, cleanliness, and consequent health.</p>
<p>Six pints of water are daily allowed, without deduction, to
each person&mdash;soldier, sailor, and prisoner&mdash;on board,
and one gallon while passing the tropics;&mdash;an allowance, I
believe, greater than is granted in merchant ships, even of the
first class. Indeed, it is more than many people think necessary;
but I have always considered it of manifest advantage not to be
niggardly in this important article, and the Lords of the
Admiralty have now ordered the above-mentioned quantity to be
issued.</p>
<p>There is always an exceedingly commodious hospital in
prison-ships, and the medicines, medical comforts, and hospital
stores, are copious, and of good quality. The sick are regularly
visited twice a day, at nine <small>A.M.</small>, and at six
<small>P.M.</small>, and oftener, if necessary. After the
visitation of the sick, all complaints that the prisoners may
have to make, are listened to, and their disputes settled. Cases,
however, that require punishment, I always dispose of after the
morning's visit.</p>
<p>With regard to punishment, I may mention, that I seldom have
recourse to floggings being enabled to preserve order without it,
and finding other measures more effective *&mdash;viz. If two
prisoners quarrel, I place them together in handcuffs, and keep
them so, until they become good friends, which generally takes
place in a very short time. If any prisoner create disturbance
below, or make use of improper language, I order him to parade
the deck during the night, with his bed tied to his
back;&mdash;four hours for the first offence, eight for the
second, &amp;c. I have seldom had occasion to repeat this
punishment, which is feared and detested: indeed, many have
frequently begged to be "punished like men;" <i>i.e.</i>,
flogged. They also have a great dislike to stand, during the day,
under charge of the sentry, with their faces aft, and without
permission to speak, or be spoken to.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In corroboration of this statement, I may
adduce the public testimony of His Excellency Colonel Arthur,
Lieut-Governor of Van Dieman's Land. "Doctor Wilson, as is usual
with that officer, has brought out the prisoners entrusted to his
care, in the very best order, and yet punishment has been
avoided."]</p>
<p>I likewise find it a good plan to give a long lecture to any
petty delinquent, and make him march off, without hearing his
defence&mdash;a source of much grief and annoyance to the London
pickpockets especially, who, in general, possess great volubility
of speech, and considerable Old Bailey experience; and are,
therefore, vexed at not having an opportunity of displaying their
forensic skill. They have often complained of the hardship at
being thus punished innocently.</p>
<p>There is, however, a class of prisoners, that, unless narrowly
looked after, frequently occasion a great deal of disturbance. I
allude to attorneys' clerks, of which class of the community I
have, in all my voyages, had a considerable number. The few
instances in which I have been compelled to inflict corporal
punishment, have been on these gentry, to whom I show no mercy,
if detected in fomenting disturbances; and I have invariably
found, that flogging a lawyer has a wonderful effect in
preserving order among the other prisoners.</p>
<p>The prisoners frequently, through mere bravado, make use of
mutinous expressions, particularly in the hearing of young
soldiers. In place of punishing such impudence with severity, I
force the vaunters to parade the decks, with mock solemnity, and
to beat up for volunteers to take the ship&mdash;to their
infinite chagrin and mortification.</p>
<p>As soon as we get into fine weather, which, unless the wind be
very unfavourable, happens in ten days or a fortnight after
leaving England, schools are established, which all the boys are
obliged to attend; and the adults are encouraged, but not
compelled, to do so. The boys are divided into classes, according
to their previous progress, and placed under the best educated,
and most moral men among the prisoners, to whom I grant some
authority, and several indulgences.</p>
<p>Every Sunday, after prayers, a public examination takes place,
and trifling rewards are bestowed on those whose progress and
conduct have merited praise. Divine service is performed by the
surgeon, at least every Sunday forenoon, after muster, when the
weather will admit of it, on the quarter-deck, where the
prisoners are all assembled,&mdash;the guard and sailors being on
the poop. I do not hesitate to say, that there may be as much
real devotion&mdash;certainly far more outward decorum&mdash;in a
convict ship, as in many churches on shore, where whispering, and
other unseemly conduct occur during the performance of Worship,
which would subject the prisoner, so irreverently behaving, to
condign punishment.</p>
<p>Divine Worship at sea has often struck me, as particularly
solemn, and calculated to make an impression on the most depraved
of the human race. Indeed, I have observed, on several such
occasions, many of the prisoners (who, according to their own
statement, rarely attended a place of worship on shore), showing
some symptoms of concern for the iniquity of their misspent
lives.</p>
<p>It has been stated, that prisoners, during the voyage, become
more depraved and demoralized, which I most positively deny; but
that they become much better, I am not prepared to assert. As
far, however, as regards decorum and propriety of language, there
is a very great improvement; yet I cannot flatter myself that I
have ever been instrumental in effectually, and permanently,
destroying deep-rooted depravity.</p>
<p>Indeed, in my humble opinion, the usual period of the voyage
is far too short to effect any radical change amongst people who
have been, perhaps, habituated to crime from their earliest
years, and hardly know what virtue is, even by name. The
principal moral object which I hold in view, during the voyage,
is to prevent, as far as possible, the ill effects likely to
result from the unavoidable close association between the casual
(and, perhaps, accidental) deviator from the paths of rectitude,
and the hardened and experienced veteran in vice and iniquity;
and I flatter myself, that my efforts in this way have not been
altogether devoid of success.</p>
<p>My chief maxim is, never to permit the slightest slang
expression to be used, nor flash songs to be sung, nor swearing;
while indecent language is punished with unrelenting severity,
and the individual so degrading himself is, in a variety of ways,
exposed to contempt and scorn.</p>
<p>It may be imagined, that to effect this salutary change among
those, who have been so long accustomed to hear and use language,
interlarded with horrid and senseless oaths, would be a work of
difficulty; but it is astonishing how soon, by proper management,
it may be accomplished. I may here state, that I have always had
the cordial co-operation of the officer of the guard, and the
master of the ship, in checking those under their command, by
punishing offences&mdash;especially impropriety of
language&mdash;which might be passed over in a barrack-room, or
in a private ship.</p>
<p>It would strike a stranger as rather a singular circumstance,
that, amongst such a heterogeneous multitude, not a single
expression is heard, which could wound the ears of delicacy; yet
such is the fact. It may, however, be imagined, that this
restraint is only partial, and that it is nearly impossible to
restrain their almost unconquerable propensity while below; yet
experience has taught me, that it can be effected.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** I do not permit dancing, wrestling, or,
indeed, any amusement to take place among the prisoners. Although
such exercises may be conducive to health, yet they are, in my
opinion, inimical to moral reformation, by recalling those scenes
of depravity and crime, of which these amusements had formed a
part On the contrary, I unceasingly endeavour to impress on their
minds a sense of their fallen state, and that it is only by a
long course of general good conduct, that they can ever hope to
be restored to that society from which they are outcasts.]</p>
<p>Many people have a very erroneous opinion of a convict ship,
in which they believe, anarchy, disorder, and irregularity, to
hold undisputed sway; whereas, on the contrary, decorum,
cleanliness, and quietness, prevail, in as great a degree as in a
well-regulated man-of-war; and I have no hesitation in stating,
that, in these respects, a convict ship is far superior to the
very best merchant vessel that sails from the port of London.
Indeed, this fact is so well known to those who have visited the
colonies, that great interest is frequently used to obtain a
passage in a convict ship.</p>
<p>I endeavour to find occupation for as many of the prisoners as
I can; and, what with keeping their persons and their berths
clean, assisting the sailors in various ways, preparing and
cooking their provisions, and parading round the decks at stated
times, the days pass uniformly and quickly during the voyage.</p>
<p>Convict ships now generally make the voyage direct; but,
formerly, they used to touch at some port&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
Madeira, Teneriffe, Porto Praya, Rio de Janeiro, or the Cape of
Good Hope.*** I consider it of importance, as regards the health
of those entrusted to my charge, to touch somewhere during the
voyage; and, whenever I have done so there has been no sickness
in the ship&mdash;whereas, when I have not done so, a strong
tendency to scurvy manifests itself among the prisoners, usually
after passing the Cape of Good Hope, which, occasionally towards
the end of the voyage, assumes a very insidious and untractable
form, when, consequently, the surgeon has no sinecure. This
circumstance I have remarked, as occurring more frequently of
late years. The cases, however, that terminate fatally, are but
few; and the emaciated soon recover their wonted vigour on the
healthy Australian shores.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** I always used to touch at Porto Praya, to
obtain a supply of fruit and vegetables, until my last voyage in
the Governor Ready, when the Governor of the Island chose to
consider the ship as a merchant vessel, and insisted on her
paying dues as such; We appealed to the British Consul, but he
could not render us any assistance; His Portuguese Excellency not
being able to understand how any vessel I could claim Government
immunities, without a pendant, and a surgeon the only naval
officer on board. {1} After some consideration, the master and
myself agreed that our case should not be made a precedent of,
and therefore gave the Consul to understand that we resisted the
claim, and should sail without a port-clearance, and in spite of
the authorities; which we accordingly did, although a little
alarmed, until out of the reach of their guns.<br>
<br>
This conduct of the Governor (who was under the Doctor's hands,
and, as we imagined, acted under his advice, as he would have
pocketed several dollars in his capacity of health-officer, had
the claim been admitted) was exceedingly injudicious, as convict
ships, by touching there, were of considerable pecuniary
advantage to the Islanders.]<br>
<br>
[[{1} The Admiralty have lately obviated this difficulty, by
ordering that a pendant, similar to that worn by transports,
should be supplied to the Surgeon-superintendent, and hoisted in
a convict ship when she touches at any foreign port, on her
voyage from England.]]</p>
<p>The average number of deaths, on the passage, is under two per
cent.; no great mortality, when it is considered, that the
constitutions of many of the prisoners have been greatly impaired
by continued courses of irregularity and dissipation.****</p>
<p class="foot">[**** I have just observed, in the newspapers,
the melancholy account of the wreck of the convict ship George
III. (the first instance of a male convict ship having been
lost). Great sickness, principally scurvy, appears to have
prevailed on board, which the surgeon attributes to the scanty
distribution of provisions, and the substitution of cocoa for
oatmeal. I am inclined to think, however, that if sickness now
prevails in an increased ratio, it may be ascribed to the
circumstance of the prisoners being embarked soon after their
conviction, instead of being, as formerly, employed, for a long
time, in the dock-yards, where, their habits being regular, their
constitutions became improved.]</p>
<p>On the ship's arrival at Hobart Town, or Sydney, the prisoners
are mustered on board, and their descriptions, trades, and
occupations, taken by the police, when every circumstance
relating to themselves, their connections, and former course of
life, is elicited, with a degree of tact, which the most skilful
and experienced rogues cannot elude.</p>
<p>After the muster-rolls are taken on shore, the prisoners are
assigned to the various applicants, by the Board of Assignment;
the members of which perform this important, but invidious duty,
without emolument.</p>
<p>The assignments being made, and approved of by the Governor,
the prisoners are landed early in the morning,* and conducted,
under the care of constables, to the prisoners' barracks, where
they are drawn up in order, for the inspection of the Governor,
who, in the forenoon of the same day, minutely examines each
individual, inquires if he has any complaint to make, as to his
treatment during the voyage&mdash;if he has had all his rations
properly cooked, &amp;c.&mdash;and if he has had a sufficient
allowance of water&mdash;also whether his money, and other
property (a list of which is read aloud to him,) be correct.</p>
<p class="foot">[* At Hobart Town, the prisoners are now landed
previous to their assignment.]</p>
<p>His Excellency then makes an address to the prisoners,
relative to their past lives and future prospects,&mdash;explains
distinctly what duties they must fulfil towards the masters to
whom they are assigned,&mdash;and what they have a legal right to
expect, in return. He points out the inevitable consequences
attending bad conduct, and the good effects resulting from
industry and regularity, which, he assures them, will, after a
certain period of probation, be the means of restoring them to
comparative freedom.</p>
<p>This address being finished, the master of the ship, and
officer of the guard, are then asked if they have any complaint
to make. If no complaints are made, the surgeon is complimented
by His Excellency, for having performed his duty in a
satisfactory manner.</p>
<p>The prisoners, who are not retained in the service of
Government, are now ready to be delivered to their masters, who,
either personally or by their agents, are in waiting to receive
them, which they do, on paying &pound;1 for each person, for a
suit of clothing, which those who are fond of cavilling consider
a great hardship, but very unjustly so; more especially at
Sydney, where, for the same sum, the prisoner is supplied with
bedding, which is, in itself, nearly worth the money.</p>
<p>In Van Dieman's Land, tradesmen and mechanics are not assigned
to settlers, being retained for the service of Government: they
are, however, lent for a certain period&mdash;from three to
twelve months&mdash;to those who stand in need of, and apply for,
them. In New South Wales, on the contrary, artificers of all
descriptions are assigned to settlers, in the order of their
application, in the same manner, and under the same conditions,
as any other class of prisoners. Indeed, Governor Bourke will not
assign a tradesman to any resident in Sydney, for two very
efficient reasons,&mdash;1<i>st.</i>. That free labour may be
encouraged there;&mdash;and, 2<i>dly</i>. That the various
artisans, who serve their time in the interior, may, on obtaining
their tickets of leave, or emancipation, be induced to settle in
the country towns, to their own advantage, and to that of the
neighbourhood. There can be no question as to the beneficial
results likely to ensue from this very judicious regulation.</p>
<p>Settlers are bound to provide their assigned servants with
food, clothing, bedding, &amp;c., according to a scale fixed by
Government. In New South Wales, the weekly ration is as
follows:&mdash;12lbs. of wheat, or 9lbs. of seconds flour, or, in
lieu thereof, at the discretion of the master, 3&frac12;lbs. of
maize meal, and 9lbs. of wheat, or 7lbs. of seconds flour; and
7lbs. of beef or mutton or 4&frac12;lbs. of salt
pork;&mdash;soap, 2oz.; salt, 2oz.; and when maize meal is
issued, 4oz. The clothing, annually, consists of two frocks or
jackets, three shirts of strong linen or calico&mdash;two pair of
trowsers&mdash;three pair of strong shoes, and one cap or
hat&mdash;and each prisoner to be constantly supplied with at
least one good blanket and palliasse or wool mattress.</p>
<p>In Van Dieman's Land, the weekly ration was&mdash;beef,
10&frac12;lbs.; flour, 10&frac12;lbs.; sugar, 7oz.; soap,
3&frac12;oz.; salt, 2oz. The clothing, per annum, consists of two
suits of woollen slop clothing, three pairs of strong boots, four
shirts, one cap or hat, and a palliasse stuffed with wool, two
blankets, and a rug. Last year, the ration of beef and flour was
reduced in Van Dieman's Land, and a proportion of vegetables
substituted&mdash;a very beneficial alteration to the settler,
and also to the prisoner; and I have no doubt that, in New South
Wales, vegetables will also form a part of the established
ration. Indeed, it is surprising, that this has not been the case
long ago, both on the score of economy and health.</p>
<p>The generality of settlers allow their assigned servants as
much as they can eat, and supply them with clothes whenever they
stand in need of them; as they find, by experience, that thus
acting is conducive to their own comfort and interest. A
stranger, on visiting a settler's establishment, may easily know
whether it is well managed, by the appearance of the servants,
especially on a Sunday. If they are observed to be clean in their
persons, and neatly dressed, he may conclude that the farm is in
a flourishing condition; while, on the contrary, if he notice
them, on that day of rest, with tattered garments, long beards,
and unwashed faces, skulking about their dirty, miserable huts,
he may safely conclude, that neither the pigsties, nor the
stables, nor the barn yard, nor the dairy, nor the flocks, nor
the herds, nor the settler's mansion, are in the best order; but
he will find disorder, insubordination, and mutual dislike,
prevailing; and that the neighbouring magistrates have a great
deal of trouble and inconvenience.</p>
<p>Those settlers who treat their assigned servants with kindness
and sympathy, rarely have occasion to regret doing so; as they
thereby get a fair proportion of labour done, as quietly and
contentedly as if they had employed free men. I do not intend, by
these remarks, to advocate over-leniency, which is as injudicious
as too much severity; and I cannot too strongly reprehend
irregular and inconsistent fits of kindness and familiarity,
quickly, and, perhaps, captiously, succeeded by harshness and
<i>hauteur</i>&mdash;a line of conduct invariably productive of
unpleasant consequences, both to the servant and to the master.
It is, I conceive, in a great measure, from the habits of
discipline acquired in that excellent school&mdash;a
man-of-war&mdash;that old sailors, in general, manage to keep
their servants in pretty good order,&mdash;obtaining, at the same
time, a just quantity of labour, without requiring much extrinsic
aid.</p>
<p>The Government hold out every possible inducement to the moral
reformation of the prisoners, by conferring indulgences on those
whose conduct is even moderately correct. After a certain period
of probation, they are either partially, or altogether restored
to freedom, under certain limitations. A prisoner for seven
years, who serves one master, four years; a prisoner for fourteen
years, who serves six, and a prisoner for life, who serves eight
years, is entitled to a ticket of leave&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the
power of selecting his employer, and working entirely for his own
benefit. A settler, who studies his own interest, ought to give
every facility to his servants in obtaining this boon. This is
generally the case; but I regret to say, that instances
occasionally occur, where the settler, just as his servant is on
the point of obtaining his ticket&mdash;especially if he be
useful&mdash;manages to catch him in some scrape, that it may be
withheld;&mdash;conduct as disgraceful as it is injudicious. A
considerate master will, and does overlook any slight fault more
readily, as the period of his servant's comparative freedom draws
near;&mdash;he being aware, selfishly speaking, that such conduct
must ultimately tend to his own advantage. In Van Dieman's Land
(I am not certain if it be also the case in New South Wales),
there is a regulation, which tends to check the above-mentioned
infirmity of human nature; <i>i.e.</i>, whenever a settler is
deprived of the services of a prisoner, by his having obtained a
ticket of leave, another servant, of the same description, is
forthwith assigned to him.</p>
<p>Tickets of leave are held on a very precarious tenure, as they
can be taken away, by the decision of two magistrates; and that
they are sometimes cancelled <i>ex causis non &aelig;quis</i>
there can be no doubt; yet, on the whole, the regulations
respecting them are, as far as circumstances will admit,
exceedingly proper and consistent.</p>
<p>After a prisoner has held a ticket of leave for a certain
period, he has a claim to emancipation, which entitles him to all
the privileges of a free person in the colony; but he cannot
leave it, which, indeed, in many cases, would, if enforced, be
felt as a very severe punishment.</p>
<p>There is an admirable regulation lately in force, regarding
the assignment of prisoners; viz., that husbands shall not be
assigned to their wives, nor wives to their husbands. Before this
regulation was adopted, transportation, in many cases, was
divested of its principal terrors, and, indeed, held out
allurements to the immoral portion of the community. For
example&mdash;the husband, after a successful course of fraud and
plunder, had only to permit himself to be detected in the
commission of a crime, which entitled him to the benefit of
transportation. Before conviction, he made over to his wife all
his ill-gotten wealth; and then he obtained a free and
comfortable passage (far more comfortable than a steerage passage
in any merchant vessel) either to Van Dieman's Land, or New South
Wales.</p>
<p>In a short time, if he has had the policy to conduct himself
properly, his wife and family were sent, at the expence of
Government, to join him; or, if he did not choose to remain long
in servitude, his wife came out in a private ship, at her own
expence (which could be well afforded), and as soon as she
arrived in the colony, her husband, whether in the service of a
private individual, or in Government employ, was immediately
assigned to her&mdash;thereby being rendered more independent
than if he had obtained a ticket of leave.</p>
<p>It might be naturally supposed, that, as the wife had the
power of getting her husband&mdash;now her assigned
servant&mdash;flogged, sent to an irongang, or otherwise
punished, that he would behave very kindly to her; but this was
not invariably the case. I have occasionally witnessed the
husband, forgetful of his inferiority, exercising his marital
authority in a very unbecoming manner, to which the wife
submitted, with meek and dutiful obedience.</p>
<p>The educated convicts are now not so well situated as in
former times, when they were assigned to professional, or
mercantile men, or employed as clerks in Government offices. From
their education and acquirements, they obtained good situations,
gave themselves airs, and lived like gentlemen; but these halcyon
days are now gone, and the specials (as they are called) are
neither assigned to private individuals, nor are they admitted
into Government offices, nor are they sent into the interior, to
live in indolence&mdash;but they are sent to a penal settlement,
where they are compelled to work at tasks suited to their
strength and delicate constitutions. That this is an exceedingly
judicious regulation, no one, excepting those who are likely to
come under its operation, will deny.</p>
<p>There has lately been a great deal of discussion in the
colonies, as to the utility of having penal settlements, where,
as many say, much expense is incurred, without adequate
advantage; and, according to their opinion, the criminals
confined there might be more usefully employed in making roads,
bridges, &amp;c., in the interior, where they could be kept as
strictly, and at far less expense, than they are, according to
the present system.</p>
<p>Prisoners who misconduct themselves, are liable to be punished
in a variety of ways;&mdash;by the infliction of corporal
chastisement, by being sentenced to an irongang, to a penal
settlement, or by an addition to their original sentence. A
single magistrate cannot order a prisoner to receive more than
fifty lashes; but flogging, although awful and degrading in name,
is often a mere farce;&mdash;the witnessing of the infliction
being usually left to a constable, who is frequently a greater
rogue than the culprit, towards whom, of course, he has a strong
fraternal feeling. I have, on more than one occasion,
accidentally seen exhibitions of this kind, when jesting, and
jocularity, mock-expressions of pain, and mock-severity,
sufficiently shewed the worse than uselessness of this mode of
punishment thus inflicted.</p>
<p>The constable reports, that the prisoner has received his
punishment, which is duly recorded; and then the constable, the
flagellator, and the pseudo-punished (if they can find an
opportunity,) take a friendly glass together, and the culprit
returns to his employer, more saucy, and more useless, than he
was before.</p>
<p>I think it is the duty of a magistrate, to be convinced that
the punishment he has awarded has been properly carried into
effect, either from personal observation, or from the report of a
person, on whom dependence can be placed. A friend of mine, a
magistrate (lately made), has acted in this way, with the
greatest advantage&mdash;the neighbourhood having soon become
very quiet.</p>
<p>That settler, however, will best consult his own interest, who
avoids, if possible, bringing his servants before any tribunal,
especially for petty offences. He has it in his own power to
preserve order, and to punish offenders, by giving or withholding
various highly-prized indulgences&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> tea, sugar,
tobacco, &amp;c.: and I can state, from actual experience and
observation, that those who act in this manner, have very little
reason to complain of their assigned servants.</p>
<p>It is not my intention to enter into the discussions which
have lately taken place, respecting the question as to whether
transportation be, or be not, an efficient secondary
punishment&mdash;I shall only state, that sometimes it is, and
sometimes it is not. A prisoner, who is assigned to a good
master, and who conducts himself with an ordinary share of
discretion, is, leaving the moral stigma aside, not much to be
pitied, as his situation is, in all probability, greatly
improved&mdash;his health and comforts being, from interested
motives, well looked after. It is true that, if he misbehaves, he
is liable to summary punishment; but the well-conducted have no
occasion for apprehension, while the fear of being subjected to
chastisement, frequently operates very beneficially on those,
who, from nature, or from bad habits, are indolently
inclined.</p>

<br>
<h4>ADVICE TO EMIGRANTS.</h4>
<br>
<p>In accordance with the custom usually adopted by those who
have lately written on New South Wales, I shall conclude this
work by a few words of advice to emigrants. My remarks, however,
will only be applicable to those who intend to follow farming
pursuits.</p>
<p>As soon as an individual has finally made up his mind to
emigrate, and it is presumed that he has not come to this
conclusion, without having bestowed due consideration on a
subject of so much importance, the first object that engages his
attention is, which part of the unoccupied world he ought to
select&mdash;Canada, or New South Wales. I have visited both, but
my knowledge being chiefly confined to the Australian colonies,
the few observations I intend to make will be confined to them;
and, without entering into any detail, as to which of these
places offers the greatest inducements to emigrants, I may simply
state, that every circumstance being duly weighed, the balance
is, in my opinion, greatly in favour of Australia.</p>
<p>The autumn is usually considered the best time for leaving
England; but this is a matter of minor importance, the most
favourable season being, in reality, when the best accommodations
can be obtained at the cheapest rate.</p>
<p>It is an object of no small importance for the
emigrant&mdash;more especially if he have a large family&mdash;to
embark in a good ship; and this may be accomplished without
difficulty, more especially as, at the present moment, so many
vessels are continually sailing for the colonies.</p>
<p>Before he engages his passage, he ought to be pretty certain,
not only as to the seaworthy state of the vessel, but; also as to
the character of the captain. I should not advise any one to
select a ship where there are many dinner parties, and other
entertainments, previously to sailing, as the numerous stores
thus improvidently and lavishly expended&mdash;having been laid
in for the voyage&mdash;will, of course, be deficient, to the
manifest discomfort of the passenger. Moreover, the captain,
after he gets to sea, regrets his indiscreet hospitality in port,
and endeavours, vainly and impolitically, to make up for it, by
niggardliness on board.</p>
<p>A few years ago, frequent disputes arose, during the voyage,
between the captain and passengers, both in the cuddy and
steerage; and, that the captain was generally in fault, may be
inferred from the fact, that, in almost all instances, where
passengers applied to a court of justice, a verdict was given in
their favour. Of late years, however, these disputes have greatly
diminished, and families may now embark in any vessel (some, of
course, are preferable to others), with the certainty of being
well, and even liberally, treated.</p>
<p>The average sum, for cabin passengers, is from &pound;70 to
&pound;80; but a family&mdash;say a man, his wife, and five
children&mdash;may be very comfortably accommodated with a
reasonable table for &pound;300 or &pound;350.</p>
<p>Although I am aware many are of a contrary opinion, yet I
would not advise a passenger to have any written agreement, as to
what kind and quantity of meat and drink is to be received by him
during the voyage, as such conduct infers suspicion and mistrust.
The owners of vessels trading to Australia from the port of
London, are wealthy; and the masters highly respectable, and not
likely to act with duplicity, after they have sailed.</p>
<p>Emigrants have frequently applied to me for information, as to
what articles they ought to take with them to the colonies; and I
have invariably advised them, not to expend their money in the
purchase, either of merchandize, household furniture,
agricultural implements, or a superfluity of wearing apparel; as
they can obtain all these articles, when they really want them,
at Sydney, or Hobart Town, nearly on as reasonable terms as in
England.</p>
<p>On arrival at Hobart Town, or Sydney, the first care of the
emigrant must be, to get into the country as fast as possible, as
a settler, who has a family, and moderate means, ought not to
idle away his time, and spend his money, which he may do, in
either of these places, with as much facility as in London. I
would also particularly caution him to be on his guard against
purchasing extraordinary good bargains, either in sheep, land, or
cattle, which may be offered to him immediately on his arrival in
the colony. The most judicious plan&mdash;whatever the temptation
to purchase may be&mdash;is, still to keep his money, rent a
farm, and remove his family to it as speedily as possible. He has
then time to look about him; also to acquire a knowledge of the
country, and its inhabitants; and to take advantage of a real
good bargain, should any such occur.</p>
<p>Having got his affairs in some order, and his family settled
on his farm, he ought to proceed in search of land; and, in doing
this, he must make up his mind to struggle with many annoyances
and disappointments. But a person who cannot dispense with what
are called "necessary comforts", nor determine to bear up against
disasters and many misfortunes, ought not to emigrate, as it is
more than probable, that, being paralyzed by supposed
insurmountable difficulties, he will become discontented and
inactive, spend the remainder of his money, regret that he was
ever induced to leave his native land, and write home dismal
accounts of the colony. Whereas, had he exerted a little extra
mental energy, all the difficulties which appeared, at first
sight, insurmountable, might have been overcome, and he would
have added another to the vast number of flourishing Australian
settlers&mdash;many of whom, to my certain knowledge, have had
great and varied difficulties to contend with in the first
instance, and are now in the well-merited enjoyment of affluent
independence.</p>
<p>Whether Van Dieman's Land, or New South Wales, ought to have
the preference, must depend on the means and objects of the
settler. If his object be to apply himself solely to agricultural
pursuits. Van Dieman's Land (where there is still fertile land
unlocated), possesses some advantages over New South Wales; but,
if he intends to direct his attention to the growth of wool, on a
large scale, then New South Wales is decidedly preferable.</p>
<p>I shall now suppose the emigrant in search of land in New
South Wales. He will proceed either north, west, or south; but I
have no doubt he will direct his course to the southward, where
there is an immense extent of excellent unlocated pastoral
land.</p>
<p>On arriving at the boundaries of the located country, he takes
up his quarters at the out-station of some settler, who has,
perhaps, recommended him to the care of the stock-keeper, or
shepherd, with directions to show the stranger the unoccupied
land&mdash;of course, at a respectable distance from his own run.
But the stranger discovers, probably by means of a well-applied
douceur, that there is a nice portion of Government land, well
watered, in the immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>Elated with this important discovery, he proceeds no further,
but returns to Sydney, hastens to the Surveyor-General's office,
and makes application for the land. Everything proceeds in due
form: the District-Surveyor is directed to measure it, and it is
advertised to be publicly sold by the Collector of Internal
Revenue, on a certain day&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, three months after
the date of the advertisement.* When the day arrives, the lot is
put up at the minimum price, five shillings per acre: five
shillings and sixpence is immediately bid, which offer is
speedily advanced upon, frequently as far as fifteen
shillings&mdash;and, on some occasions, it reaches one pound, to
the great advantage of the Government&mdash;to the surprise and
chagrin of the disappointed emigrant,&mdash;and to the rage of
the purchaser, who, it may be readily imagined, is the owner of
the adjoining land, and who thinks that the emigrant has
committed a flagrant breach of hospitality, in putting the said
land up for sale; while the emigrant thinks the other party has
acted in a very unfriendly manner, by bidding against him.</p>
<p class="foot">[* This period might be shortened, without
inconvenience to Government, and with great advantage to the
emigrant.]</p>
<p>Thus disappointed, the emigrant proceeds to put up for sale
several lots, similarly situated, in the hopes that he may be
successful in obtaining one of them; but each lot is purchased by
the owner of the adjacent land, who feels much annoyance at being
thus compelled to buy the land, which he purposed doing at a more
convenient opportunity.</p>
<p>The emigrant now loses heart, and thinks every person combined
against him, while, in fact, his disappointments are caused by
his own injudicious conduct. In a pastoral country, it is of the
greatest importance to the sheep-farmer, to possess extent of
run; and he therefore uses every endeavour to prevent being
hemmed in, as he is then forced, at much inconvenience and
expense, to form new establishments, at a considerable distance
in the interior. It is, therefore, not to be expected, that any
individual&mdash;unless possessing a greater share of
disinterestedness than usually falls to the lot of
humanity&mdash;will, if he can prevent it, permit a stranger to
occupy land, which would diminish the value of his own, by taking
away the advantages of an extensive Government run. He,
therefore, very naturally, uses the unlocated land, as long as he
can, for nothing; with the determination, however, to purchase it
at some future tune, or whenever it is put up for sale.</p>
<p>I therefore advise the emigrant not to be tempted to put up
land for sale, immediately in the vicinity of another settler's,
as he will not obtain it, unless at a price far above its real
value; while, at the same time, by such a proceeding, he will
subject himself to disappointment, and ruinous delay, which he
will avoid, by proceeding, at once, to some distance from any
located land, where he should select a section,** or more,
according to his means, well supplied with water&mdash;if
possible, taking in every water-hole in the neighbourhood, as
water, in many parts of New South Wales, is far more valuable
than land. By this line of conduct, he will secure to himself the
advantage of, perhaps, several thousand acres of excellent
land&mdash;thus rendered useless to any other person; and then he
need not view the visit of a new emigrant with apprehension.</p>
<p class="foot">[** A square mile, 640 acres. Government do not
dispose of less, except under peculiar circumstances.]</p>
<p>When the settler has, at length, obtained his land, he ought
to form his establishment on it, without delay; and it is
presumed he has acquired, from personal observation, the most
judicious mode of doing so. I may only state, that he cannot be
too cautious in the expenditure of his capital, in improvements
on his farm; more particularly in expensive buildings.</p>
<p>In all his pursuits and improvements, he ought to have in view
the growth of fine wool, which, especially in the interior, must
constitute his principal revenue; and it is supposed, that while
he has been looking out for land, he has also been employed in
procuring a flock or two of young ewes, which, at present, can be
obtained, of good quality, for one pound per head.</p>
<p>Many calculations have been made, as to the immense increase
of sheep, and the profit to be derived therefrom; but, as these
calculations are frequently just within the limits of
possibility, the settler may be disappointed in the anticipated
results. Suffice it, therefore, to mention, that sheep-farming,
taking all contingencies into consideration, offers an excellent
and safe means of obtaining a large return for capital thus
invested.</p>
<p>I would not recommend emigrants to carry out with them
overseers, or indentured servants of any description, as I have
never yet seen, nor heard of, such engagements terminating
satisfactorily: on the contrary, they have invariably proved a
source of great annoyance, expense, and inconvenience. The
emigrant can be at no loss for servants in the colony, either
free or assigned; especially as the Government very considerately
give the preference to the applications of new settlers for
assigned servants.</p>
<p>The principal drawback to the domestic comfort of a family,
arises from the character of the female assigned servants, who
are, for the most part, exceedingly depraved; but this
inconvenience is gradually decreasing, from the number of free
women now emigrating to the colonies, with great advantage to
themselves, and to the general interests of society.</p>
<p>It is not to be denied, however, that there are other
drawbacks to the comfort of an emigrant; the chief of which may
be reckoned the bushrangers&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, runaway prisoners,
who occasionally commit great depredations, and acts of cruelty;
but the greatest danger to be apprehended from them is in the
neighbourhood of towns; while in the interior, there is seldom
much cause for alarm, although instances of wanton outrage, and
insubordination, have sometimes taken place, even in
well-regulated farms. But such unfortunate occurrences are
exceedingly rare; and the settler, with judicious management, may
consider himself more secure, in person and property, surrounded
with prisoner-servants, in the wilds of New Holland, than he
would be in many parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>With regard to the class of persons likely to be benefitted by
emigration, I may state, that those with large families, of
industrious habits, and whose incomes are limited, are certain of
bettering their condition, and need not be under the painful
necessity, in their old age, of parting with their offspring;
whom, on the contrary, like the ancient Patriarchs, they may see
settled around them, and advancing towards independence.</p>
<p>It is not absolutely necessary, to the success of the
emigrant, that he should possess much previous knowledge of rural
affairs. Soldiers, merchants, professional men, and many others,
whose previous habits of life have been very different, soon
acquire the requisite knowledge; and I have already observed,
that sailors make excellent settlers.</p>
<p>I have often contrasted the situation of half-pay officers in
the navy, who are settlers in New South Wales, with that of those
who remain at home, wasting their time in listless idleness; and,
to me, the contrast is the more striking, being one day in
London, where I seldom fail to meet a nautical acquaintance,
solitarily perambulating the crowded streets&mdash;and another
day, in Australia, where I meet the same class of officers,
actively and profitably employed in the pleasing task of
superintending their flocks and herds, and bringing their land
under cultivation; and, instead of dining sparingly at an
economical chop-house, or even at a club, sitting down, with the
healthy olive branches smiling around, at a well-spread table,
which, in turns, "<i>abundat porco, h&aelig;do, agno
gallin&acirc;, lacte, caseo, copiaque omnium rerum qu&aelig; ad
victum hominum pertinent</i>," the produce of their own
farms.</p>
<p>Although, as I have previously stated, a settler must, in the
first instance, expect to struggle with numerous difficulties,
and suffer various privations, yet, in a short time, by prudence
and perseverance, he will be able, in the words of Cobbett, "to
live well, keep generous hospitality, take his pleasure, enjoy a
good deal of leisure, and possess his farm unincumbered."</p>
<p>To conclude.&mdash;During the number of years I have been
connected with the colonies, I have never known an instance of a
settler, either master or servant, possessing a moderate share of
prudence and industry, who has ever had occasion to regret
leaving his native land.</p>
<p>In the foregoing remarks, I have abstained from indulging in
any theoretical views&mdash;imagining, that the relation of a few
facts, derived from experience and observation, might be more
acceptable to those who purpose emigrating to New South Wales, or
Van Dieman's Land.</p>
