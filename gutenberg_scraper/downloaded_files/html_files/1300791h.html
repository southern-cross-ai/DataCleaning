<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>THE URBINIAN</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>In that shrewd chapter of his upon a prince's choice of
ministers&mdash;of which I shall presently have more to
say&mdash;Messer Niccolò Macchiavelli discovers three degrees in
the intelligence of mankind. To the first belong those who
understand things for themselves by virtue of their own natural
endowments; to the second those who have at least the wit to
discern what others understand; and to the third those who neither
understand things for themselves nor yet through the demonstrations
which others afford them. The first are rare and excellent, since
they are the inventive and generative class; the second are of
merit, since if not actually productive, they are at least
reproductive; the third, being neither one nor the other, but mere
parasites who prey for their existence&mdash;and often
profitably&mdash;upon the other two, are entirely worthless.</p>
<p>There is yet a fourth class which the learned and subtle
Florentine appears to have overlooked, a class which combines in
itself the attributes of those other three. In this class I would
place the famous Corvinus Trismegistus, who was the very oddest
compound of inventiveness and stupidity, of duplicity and
simplicity, of deceit and credulity, of guile and innocence, of
ingenuity and ingenuousness, as you shall judge.</p>
<p>To begin with, Messer Corvinus Trismegistus had
mastered&mdash;as his very name implies&mdash;all the secrets of
Nature, of medicine, and of magic; so that the fame of him had gone
out over the face of Italy like a ripple over water.</p>
<p>He knew, for instance, that the oil of scorpions captured in
sunshine during the period of Sol in Scorpio&mdash;a most essential
condition this&mdash;was an infallible cure for the plague. He knew
that to correct an enlargement of the spleen, the certain way was
to take the spleen of a goat, apply it for four-and-twenty hours to
the affected part, and thereafter expose it to the sun; in a
measure as the goat's spleen should desiccate and wither, in such
measure should the patient's spleen be reduced and restored to
health. He knew that the ashes of a wolf's skin never failed as a
remedy for baldness, and that to arrest bleeding at the nose
nothing could rival an infusion from the bark of an olive-tree,
provided the bark were taken from a young tree in the case of a
young patient, and from an old tree in the case of an old patient.
He knew that serpents stewed in wine, and afterwards eaten, would
make sound and whole a leper, by conferring upon him the serpent's
faculty of changing its skin.</p>
<p>Deeply, too, was he versed in poisons and enchantments, and he
made no secret&mdash;so frank and open was his nature&mdash;of his
power to conjure spirits and, at need, to restore the dead to life.
He had discovered an elixir vitae that preserved him still young
and vigorous at the prodigious age of two thousand years, which he
claimed to have attained; and another elixir, called Acqua
Celeste&mdash;a very complex and subtle distillation
this&mdash;that would reduce an old man's age by fifty years, and
restore to him his lost youth.</p>
<p>All this and much more was known to Corvinus the Thrice-Mage,
although certain folk of Sadducaic mind have sought to show that
the sum of his knowledge concerned the extent to which he could
abuse the credulity of his contemporaries and render them his
dupes. Similarly it was alleged&mdash;although his adherents set it
down to the spite and envy that the great must for ever be
provoking in the mean&mdash;that his real name was just Pietro
Corvo, a name he got from his mother, who kept a wine-shop in
Forli, and who could not herself with any degree of precision have
named his father. And these deriders added that his having lived
two thousand years was an idle vaunt since there were still many
alive who remembered to have seen him as an ill-kempt, dirty urchin
wallowing in the kennels of his native town.</p>
<p>Be all that as it may, there is no denying that he had achieved
a great and well-deserved renown, and that he waxed rich in his
mean dwelling in Urbino&mdash;that Itala Atene, the cradle of
Italian art and learning. And to wax rich is, after all, considered
by many to be the one outward sign of inward grace, the one
indubitable proof of worth. To them, at least, it follows that
Messer Corvinus was worthy.</p>
<p>This house of his stood in a narrow street behind the Oratory of
San Giovanni, a street of crazy buildings that leaned across to
each other until, had they been carried a little higher, they must
have met in a Gothic arch, to exclude the slender strip of sky
which, as it was, remained visible.</p>
<p>It was a quarter of the town admirably suited to a man of the
magician's studious habits. The greater streets of Urbino might
tremble under the tramp of armed multitudes in those days when the
Lord Cesare Borgia, Duke of Valentinois and Romagna, was master of
the city, and the peaceful, scholarly Duke Guidobaldo a fugitive
outcast. Down that narrow, ill-paved gap of sordid dwellings came
no disturbers of the peace. So that Corvinus Trismegistus was left
to pursue his studies unmolested, to crush his powders, and distil
his marvellous elixirs.</p>
<p>Thither to seek his help and his advice came folk from every
quarter of Italy. Thither in the first hour of a fair June night,
about a fortnight after Cesare Borgia's occupation of Urbino, came,
attended by two grooms, the Lady Bianca de' Fioravanti. This Lady
Bianca was the daughter of that famous Fioravanti who was Lord of
San Leo, the only fortress in Guidobaldo's territory which,
emboldened by its almost impregnable position, still held out in
defiance of the irresistible Valentinois.</p>
<p>With much had heaven blessed Madonna Bianca. Wealth was hers and
youth, and a great name; culture and a beauty that has been the
subject of some songs. And yet, with all these gifts there was
still something that she lacked&mdash;something without which all
else was vain; something that brought her by night, a little
fearfully, to the grim house of Messer Corvinus as a suppliant. To
attract the less attention she came on foot and masked, and with no
more attendance than just that of her two grooms. As they entered
the narrow street, she bade one of these extinguish the torch he
carried. Thereafter, in the dark, they had come, almost groping,
stumbling on the rough kidney stones, to the magician's door.</p>
<p>'Go knock, Taddeo,' she bade one of her servants.</p>
<p>And on her words there happened the first of those miracles by
which Madonna Bianca was to be convinced beyond all doubting of the
supernatural quality of the powers that Messer Corvinus
wielded.</p>
<p>Even as the servant took his first step towards the door, this
opened suddenly, apparently of itself, and in the passage appeared
a stately, white-robed Nubian bearing a lanthorn. This he now
raised, so that its yellow shafts showered their light upon Madonna
and her followers. There was, of course, no miracle in that. The
miracle lay in another apparition. In the porch itself, as if
materialized suddenly out of the circumambient gloom, stood a tall,
cloaked figure, black from head to foot, the face itself concealed
under a black visor. This figure bowed, and waved Madonna onward
into the house.</p>
<p>She drew back in fear; for, having come to a place of wonders,
expecting wonders, she accounted it but natural that wonders she
should find, and it never entered her mind to suppose that here was
but another who sought Corvinus, one who had arrived ahead of her,
and in response to whose earlier knock it was that the door had
opened, just a courteous gentleman who stood now deferring to her
sex and very obvious importance.</p>
<p>Devoutly she crossed herself, and observing that the act did not
cause this black famulus&mdash;as she supposed him&mdash;to
dissolve and vanish, she reflected that at least his origin could
not be daemoniac, took courage and went in, for all that her knees
shook under her as she passed him.</p>
<p>The supposed famulus followed close upon her heels, the grooms
came last, together and something cowed, though they were men she
had chosen for the stoutness of their courage. The gloom, the
uncanny gentleman in black, the grinning Nubian, all teeth and
eyeballs, affected them unpleasantly.</p>
<p>The Nubian closed the door and barred it, the metal ringing
shrilly as it fell. Then he faced about to ask them formally what
and whom they sought. It was the lady who answered, unmasking as
she spoke.</p>
<p>'I am Bianca de' Fioravanti, and I seek the very learned Messer
Corvinus Trismegistus.'</p>
<p>The Nubian bowed silently, bade her follow, and moved down the
long stone passage, his lanthorn swinging as he went, and flinging
its yellow disc of light to and fro upon the grimy walls. Thus they
came to a stout oaken door studded with great nails of polished
steel, and by this into a bare anteroom. There were dried rushes on
the floor, a wooden bench was set against the wall, and upon a
massive, four legged table stood an oil-lamp, whose ruddy,
quivering flame, ending in a pennon of black smoke, shed a little
light and a deal of smell.</p>
<p>Their guide waved a brown hand towards the bench. 'Your lackeys
may await your excellency here,' said he.</p>
<p>She nodded, and briefly gave her order to the grooms. They
obeyed her, though with visible reluctance. Then the Nubian opened
a second door, at the chamber's farther end. He drew aside a heavy
curtain, with a startling clash of metal rings, and disclosed what
seemed at first no more than a black gap.</p>
<p>'The dread Corvinus Trismegistus bids you enter,' he
announced.</p>
<p>For all the stoutness of her spirit the Lady Bianca now drew
back. But as her eyes remained fixed upon the gap, she presently
saw the gloom in part dispelled, and dimly she began to perceive
some of the furnishings of that inner room. She took courage,
bethought her of the great boon she sought at the magician's hands,
and so crossed the dread threshold and passed into that mysterious
chamber.</p>
<p>After her, in close attendance, ever silent, came the gentleman
of the mask. Believing him to be of the household of the mage, and
his attendance a necessary condition, she made no demur to it;
whilst the Nubian, on the other hand, supposing him, from his mask
and the richness of his cloak, to be her companion, made no attempt
to check his ingress.</p>
<p>Thus, together, these two passed into the dim twilight of the
room. The curtains rasped together again behind them, and the door
clanged sepulchrally.</p>
<p>Madonna peered about her, her breath shortened, her heart
beating unduly. A line of radiance along the ceiling, mysterious of
source, very faintly revealed her surroundings to her: three or
four chairs, capacious and fantastically carved, a table of plain
wood against the wall immediately before her, crowded with strange
vessels of glass and of metal that gleamed as they were smitten by
rays of the faint light. No window showed. From ceiling to floor
the chamber was hung with black draperies; it was cold and silent
as the tomb, and of the magician there was no sign.</p>
<p>The eeriness of the place increased her awe, trammelled her
reason, and loosed her imagination. She sat down to await the
advent of the dread Corvinus. And then the second miracle took
place. Chancing to look round in quest of that black famulus who
had materialized to escort her, she discovered, to her infinite
amazement, that he had vanished. As mysteriously as he had first
taken shape in the porch before her eyes, had he now dissolved
again and melted away into the all-encompassing gloom.</p>
<p>She caught her breath at this, and then, as if something had
still been needed to scatter what remained of her wits, a great
pillar of fire leapt suddenly into being in mid-chamber,
momentarily to blind her and to wring from her a cry of fear. As
suddenly it vanished, leaving a stench of sulphur in the air; and
then a voice, deep, booming, and immensely calm, rang in her
ears.</p>
<p>'Fear not, Bianca de' Fioravanti. I am here. What do you seek of
me?'</p>
<p>The poor, overwrought lady looked before her in the direction of
the voice, and witnessed the third miracle.</p>
<p>Gradually before her eyes, where there had been impenetrable
gloom&mdash;where, indeed, it had seemed to her that the chamber
ended in a wall&mdash;she saw a man, an entire scene, gradually
assume shape and being as she watched. Nor did it occur to her that
it might be her eyesight's slow recovery from the blinding flash of
light that conveyed to her this impression of gradual
materialization. Soon it was complete&mdash;in focus, as it were,
and quite distinct.</p>
<p>She beheld a small table or pulpit upon which stood a gigantic
open tome, its leaves yellow with a great age, its colossal silver
clasps gleaming in the light from the three beaks of a tall-stemmed
bronze lamp of ancient Greek design, in which some aromatic oil was
being burned. At the lamp's foot a human skull grinned horribly. To
the right of the table stood a tripod supporting a brazier in which
a mass of charcoal was glowing ruddily. At the table itself, in a
high-backed chair, sat a man in a scarlet gown, his head covered by
a hat like an inverted saucepan. His face was lean and gaunt, the
nose and cheekbones very prominent; his forehead was high and
narrow, his red beard bifurcate, and his eyes, which were turned
full upon his visitor, reflecting the cunningly set light, gleamed
with an uncanny penetration.</p>
<p>Behind him, in the background, stood crucible and alembic, and
above these an array of shelves laden with phials, coffers, and
retorts. But of all this she had the most fleeting and subconscious
of impressions. All attention of which she was capable was focused
upon the man himself. She was, too, as one in a dream, so
bewildered had her senses grown by all that she had witnessed.</p>
<p>'Speak, Madonna,' the magician calmly urged her. 'I am here to
do your will.'</p>
<p>It was encouraging, and would have been still more encouraging
had she but held some explanation of the extraordinary manner of
his advent. Still overawed, she spoke at last, her voice
unsteady.</p>
<p>'I need your help,' said she. 'I need it very sorely.'</p>
<p>'It is yours, Madonna, to the entire extent of my vast
science.'</p>
<p>'You&mdash;you have great learning?' she half-questioned,
half-affirmed.</p>
<p>'The limitless ocean,' he answered modestly, 'is neither so wide
nor so deep as my knowledge. What is your need?'</p>
<p>She was mastering herself now; and if she faltered still and
hesitated it was because the thing she craved was not such as a
maid may boldly speak of. She approached her subject gradually.</p>
<p>'You possess the secret of great medicines,' said she, 'of
elixirs that will do their work not only upon the body, but at need
upon the very spirit?'</p>
<p>'Madonna,' he answered soberly, 'I can arrest the decay of age,
or compel the departed spirit of the dead to return and restore the
body's life. And since it is Nature's law that the greater must
include the less, let that reply suffice you.'</p>
<p>'But can you&mdash;'She paused. Then, impelled by her need, her
last fear forgotten now that she was well embarked upon the
business, she rose and approached him. 'Can you command love?' she
asked, and gulped. 'Can you compel the cold to grow impassioned,
the indifferent to be filled with longings? Can you&mdash;can you
do this?'</p>
<p>He pondered her at some length.</p>
<p>'Is this your need?' quoth he, and there was wonder in his
voice. 'Yours or another's?'</p>
<p>'It is my need,' she answered low. 'My own.'</p>
<p>He sat back, and further considered the pale beauty of her, the
low brow, the black, lustrous tresses in their golden net, the
splendid eyes, the alluring mouth, the noble height and shape.</p>
<p>'Magic I have to do your will at need,' he said slowly; 'but
surely no such magic as is Nature's own endowment of you. Can he
resist the sorcery of those lips and eyes&mdash;this man for whose
subjection you desire my aid?'</p>
<p>'Alas! He thinks not of such things. His mind is set on war and
armaments. His only mistress is ambition.'</p>
<p>'His name,' quoth the sage imperiously. 'What is his
name&mdash;his name and his condition?'</p>
<p>She lowered her glance. A faint flush tinged her cheeks. She
hesitated, taken by a fluttering panic. Yet she dared not deny him
the knowledge he demanded, lest, vexed by her refusal, he should
withhold his aid.</p>
<p>'His name,' she faltered at length, 'is Lorenzo
Castrocaro&mdash;a gentleman of Urbino a condottiero who serves
under the banner of the Duke of Valentinois.'</p>
<p>'A condottiero blind to beauty, blind to such warm loveliness as
yours, Madonna?' cried Corvinus. 'So anomalous a being, such a
<i>lusus naturae</i> will require great medicine.'</p>
<p>'Opportunity has served me none too well,' she explained, almost
in self-defence. 'Indeed, circumstance is all against us. My father
is the castellan of San Leo, devoted to Duke Guidobaldo, wherefore
it is natural that we should see but little of one who serves under
the banner of the foe. And so I fear that he may go his ways unless
I have that which will bring him to me in despite of all.'</p>
<p>Corvinus considered the matter silently awhile, then sighed. 'I
see great difficulties to be overcome,' said that wily mage.</p>
<p>'But you can help me to overcome them?'</p>
<p>His gleaming eyes considered her.</p>
<p>'It will be costly,' he said.</p>
<p>'What's that to me? Do you think I'll count the cost in such a
matter?'</p>
<p>The wizard drew back, frowned, and wrapped himself in a great
dignity.</p>
<p>'Understand me,' said he with some asperity. 'This is no shop
where things are bought and sold. My knowledge and my magic are at
the service of all humanity. These I do not sell. I bestow them
freely and without fee upon all who need them. But if I give so
much, so very much, it cannot be expected that I should give more.
The drugs I have assembled from all corners of the earth are often
of great price. That price it is yours to bear, since the medicine
is for your service.'</p>
<p>'You have such medicine, then!' she cried, her hands clasping in
sudden increase of hopefulness.</p>
<p>He nodded his assent.</p>
<p>'Love philtres are common things enough, and easy of preparation
in the main. Any rustic hag who deals in witchcraft and preys on
fools can brew one.' The contempt of his tone was withering. 'But
for your affair, where great obstacles must be surmounted, or ever
the affinities can be made to respond, a drug of unusual power is
needed. Such a drug I have&mdash;though little of it, for in all
the world there is none more difficult to obtain. Its chief
component is an extract from the brain of a rare bird&mdash;<i>avis
rarissima</i>&mdash;of Africa.'</p>
<p>With feverish fingers she plucked a heavy purse from her girdle
and splashed it upon the table. It fell against the grinning skull,
and thus cheek by jowl with each other, lay Life's two
masters&mdash;Death and Gold.</p>
<p>'Fifty ducats!' she panted in her excitement. 'Will that
suffice?'</p>
<p>'Perhaps,' said he, entirely disdainful. 'Should it fall
something short, I will myself add what may be lacking.' And with
contemptuous fingers, eloquent of his scorn of mere profit, he
pushed the purse aside, a thing of no account in this
transaction.</p>
<p>She began to protest that more should be forthcoming. But he
nobly overbore her protestations. He rose, revealing the broad,
black girdle that clasped his scarlet robe about his waist, all
figured with the signs of the zodiac wrought in gold. He stepped to
the shelves, and took from one of them a bronze coffer of some
size. With this he returned to the table, set it down, opened it,
and drew forth a tiny phial&mdash;a slender little tube of glass
that was plugged and sealed.</p>
<p>It contained no more than a thread of deep amber fluid&mdash;a
dozen drops at most. He held it up so that it gleamed golden in the
light.</p>
<p>'This,' he said, 'is my <i>elixirium aureum</i>, my golden
elixir, a rare and very subtle potion, sufficient for your need.'
Abruptly he proffered it to her.</p>
<p>With a little cry of gratitude and joy she held out avid hands
to take the phial. But as her fingers were about to close upon it,
he snatched it back, and raised a hand impressively to restrain
her.</p>
<p>'Attend to me,' he bade her, his glittering eye regarding her
intensely. 'To this golden elixir you shall add two drops of your
own blood, neither more nor less; then contrive that Messer Lorenzo
drink it in his wine. But all must be done while the moon is
waxing; and, in a measure, as the moon continues to grow, so will
his passion mount and abide in him. And before that same moon shall
have begun to wane this Lorenzo Castrocaro will come to you, though
the whole world lie between you, and he will be your utter and
absolute slave. The present is a propitious time. Go, and be you
happy.'</p>
<p>She took the phial, which he now relinquished, and broke into
thanks.</p>
<p>But imperiously, by a wave of the hand and a forbidding look, he
stemmed her gratitude. He smote a little gong that stood by.</p>
<p>There was the sound of an opening door. The curtains parted with
a clash, and the white-robed Nubian appeared salaaming on the
threshold, waiting to reconduct her.</p>
<p>Madonna Bianca bowed to the great magician, and departed
overawed by the majesty of his demeanour. She had passed out, and
still the Nubian waited on the threshold&mdash;waited for the man
he had admitted with her. But Corvinus, knowing naught of his
slave's motive for lingering, bade him harshly begone; whereupon
the curtains were drawn together again, and the door was
closed.</p>
<p>Left alone, the magician flung off the great mantle of overawing
dignity, descended from the lofty indifference to gain, natural
enough in one who is master of the ages, and became humanly
interested in the purse which Madonna Bianca had left him. Drawing
wide the mouth of it, he emptied the golden contents on to the vast
page of his book of magic. He spread the glittering mass, and
fingered it affectionately, chuckling in his red beard. And then,
quite suddenly, his chuckle was echoed by a laugh, short, abrupt,
contemptuous, and sinister.</p>
<p>With a startled gasp Corvinus looked up, his hands spreading to
cover and protect the gold, his eyes dilating with a sudden fear, a
fear that swelled at what he saw. Before him, in mid-chamber,
surged a tall figure all in black&mdash;black cloak, black cap, and
black face, out of which two gleaming eyes considered him.</p>
<p>Trembling in every fibre, white of cheek, his mouth and eyes
agape, a prey to a terror greater far than any it had ever been his
lot to inspire in others, the wizard stared at the dread phantom,
and assumed&mdash;not unnaturally it must be confessed&mdash;that
here was Satan come to claim his own at last.</p>
<p>There fell a pause. Corvinus attempted to speak, to challenge
the apparition. But courage failed him; terror struck him dumb.</p>
<p>Presently the figure advanced, silent-footed, menacing; and the
wizard's knees were loosened under him. He sank gibbering into his
high-backed chair, and waited for death with Hell to follow. At
least, you see, he knew what he deserved.</p>
<p>The apparition halted at last, before the table, within arm's
length of Corvinus, and a voice came to break the awful spell, a
voice infinitely mocking yet unquestionably, reassuringly
human.</p>
<p>'Greetings, Thrice-Mage!' it said.</p>
<p>It took Corvinus some moments to realize that his visitor was
mortal, after all, and some further moments to recover some
semblance of self-possession. An incipient chagrin mingling with
the remains of his fears, he spoke at last.</p>
<p>'Who art thou?' he cried, the voice, which he would fain have
rendered bold, high-pitched and quavering.</p>
<p>The cloak opened, displaying a graceful well-knit figure in
sable velvet that was wrought with golden arabesques. From a girdle
studded with great fiery rubies hung a long and heavy dagger, whose
hilt and scabbard were of richly chiselled gold. On the backs of
the black velvet gloves diamonds hung and sparkled like drops of
water, to complete the sombre splendour of the man's apparel. One
of the hands was raised to pluck away the visor and disclose the
youthful, aquiline, and very noble countenance of Cesare Borgia,
Duke of Valentinois and Romagna.</p>
<p>Corvinus recognized him on the instant, and recognizing him was
far from sure that things would have been worse had his visitor
been the devil, as he had at first supposed. 'My lord!' he cried,
profoundly amazed, profoundly uneasy. And, thinking aloud in his
consternation, he added the question, foolish in a master of all
secrets: 'How came you in?'</p>
<p>'I too, know something of magic,' said the tawny-headed young
duke, and there was mockery in his voice and in the smile he bent
upon the wizard.</p>
<p>He did not think it necessary to explain that all the magic he
had employed had been to enter as if in attendance upon Madonna
Bianca de' Fioravanti, and then to slip silently behind the black
arras with which, to serve his purposes of deception, Messer
Corvinus hung his walls.</p>
<p>But the magician was not duped. Who makes the image does not
worship it. The truth&mdash;the precise truth&mdash;of magic was
known undoubtedly to Corvinus, and it therefore follows that he
could not for a moment suppose that the means by which the Duke had
gained admittance had been other than perfectly natural ones. Anon
the Nubian should be keenly questioned, and if necessary as keenly
whipped. Meanwhile, the Duke himself must claim attention, and
Corvinus&mdash;knowing himself a rogue&mdash;was far from easy.</p>
<p>But if he was not easy at least he was master of an
inexhaustible store of impudence, and upon this he made now a heavy
draught. To cover his momentary discomfiture, he smiled now as
inscrutably as the Duke. Quickly he thrust the gold back into the
purse, never heeding a coin that fell and rolled away along the
floor. He tossed that purse aside, and, retaining his seat what
time his highness remained standing, he combed his long, bifurcate
beard.</p>
<p>'Betwixt your magic and mine, Magnificent, there is some
difference,' he said, with sly suggestion.</p>
<p>'I should not be here else,' replied the Duke; and abruptly he
proceeded to the matter that had brought him. 'It is said you have
found an elixir that restores the dead to life.'</p>
<p>'It is rightly said, my lord,' replied the wizard with
assurance. He was becoming master of himself again.</p>
<p>'You have tested it?' quoth Cesare.</p>
<p>'In Cyprus, three years ago, I restored life to a man who had
been dead two days. He is still living, and will testify.'</p>
<p>'Your word suffices me,' said the Duke; and the irony was so sly
that Corvinus was left wondering whether irony there had been. 'At
need, no doubt, you would make proof of it upon yourself?'</p>
<p>Corvinus turned cold from head to foot, yet answered boldly of
very necessity:</p>
<p>'At need, I would.'</p>
<p>Valentinois sighed as one who is content, and Corvinus took
heart again.</p>
<p>'You have this elixir at hand?'</p>
<p>'Enough to restore life to one man&mdash;just that and no more.
It is a rare and very precious liquor, and very costly, as you may
perceive, Magnificent.'</p>
<p>'Derived, no doubt, from the brain of some rare bird of Africa?'
the Duke mocked him.</p>
<p>By not so much as a flicker of the eyelid did Corvinus
acknowledge the hit.</p>
<p>'Not so, Magnificent,' he replied imperturbably. 'It is derived
from&mdash;' 'No matter!' said the Duke, 'let me have it!'</p>
<p>The magician rose, turned to his shelves, and sought there
awhile. Presently he came back with a phial containing a blood-red
liquid.</p>
<p>'It is here,' he said, and he held the slender vessel to the
light, so that it glowed like a ruby.</p>
<p>'Force apart the teeth of the dead man, and pour this draught
down his throat. Within an hour he will revive, provided the body
has first been warmed before a fire.'</p>
<p>Valentinois took the phial slowly in his gloved fingers. He
considered it, his countenance very thoughtful.</p>
<p>'It cannot fail to act?' he questioned.</p>
<p>'It cannot fail, Magnificent,' replied the mage.</p>
<p>'No matter how the man may have died?'</p>
<p>'No matter how, provided that no vital organ shall have been
destroyed.'</p>
<p>'It can conquer death by poison?'</p>
<p>'It will dissolve and dissipate the poison, no matter what its
nature, as vinegar will melt a pearl.'</p>
<p>'Excellent!' said the Duke, and he smiled his cold, inscrutable
smile. 'And now another matter, Thrice-Mage.' He thoughtfully
fingered his tawny beard. 'There is a rumour afoot in Italy,
spread, no doubt, by yourself to further the thieving charlatan's
trade you drive, that the Sultan Djem was poisoned by the Holy
Father, and that the poison&mdash;a poison so subtle and miraculous
that it lay inert in the Turk for a month before it slew
him&mdash;was supplied to his Holiness by you.'</p>
<p>The Duke paused as if for a reply, and Corvinus shivered again
in fear, so coldly sinister had been the tone.</p>
<p>'That is not true, Magnificent. I have had no dealings with the
Holy Father, and I have supplied him with no poisons. I know not
how Messer Djem may have died, nor have I ever said I did.'</p>
<p>'How, then, comes this story current, and your name in it?'</p>
<p>Corvinus hastened to explain. Explanations were a merchandise
with which he was well stocked.</p>
<p>'It may be thus. Of such a poison I possess the secret, and some
there have been who have sought it from me. Hence, no doubt,
knowing that I have it and conceiving that it was used, the vulgar
have drawn conclusions, as the vulgar will, unwarrantably.'</p>
<p>Cesare smiled.</p>
<p>''Tis very subtle, Trismegistus.' And he nodded gravely. 'And
you say that you have such a poison? What, pray, may be its
nature?'</p>
<p>'That, Magnificent, is secret,' was the answer.</p>
<p>'I care not. I desire to know, and I have asked you.'</p>
<p>There was no heat in the rejoinder. It was quite
cold&mdash;deadly cold. But it had more power to compel than any
anger. Corvinus fenced no more; he made haste to answer.</p>
<p>'It consists chiefly of the juice of catapuce and the powdered
yolk of an egg, but its preparation is not easy.'</p>
<p>'You have it at hand?'</p>
<p>'Here, Magnificent,' replied the mage.</p>
<p>And from the same bronze coffer whence he had taken the
love-philtre&mdash;the golden elixir&mdash;he drew now a tiny cedar
box, opened it, and placed it before the Duke. It contained a fine
yellow powder.</p>
<p>'One drachm of that will kill thirty days after it has been
administered, two drachms in half the time.'</p>
<p>Cesare sniffed it and eyed the mage sardonically.</p>
<p>'I desire to make experiment,' said he. 'How much is here?'</p>
<p>'Two drachms, highness.'</p>
<p>The Duke held out the box to Corvinus.</p>
<p>'Swallow it,' he bade him calmly.</p>
<p>The mage drew back in an alarm that almost argued faith in his
own statement. 'My lord!' he cried, aghast.</p>
<p>'Swallow it,' Cesare repeated, without raising his voice.
Corvinus blinked and gulped. 'Would you have me die, my lord?'</p>
<p>'Die? Do you, then, confess yourself mortal,
Thrice-Mage&mdash;you, the great Corvinus Trismegistus, whose
knowledge is wide and deep as the limitless ocean, you who are so
little sensible to the ills and decay of the flesh that already you
have lived two thousand years? Is the potency of this powder such
that it can slay even the immortals?'</p>
<p>And now, at last, Corvinus began to apprehend the real scope of
Cesare's visit. It was true that he had set it about that the
Sultan Djem had been poisoned, and that he had boasted that he
himself had supplied the Borgias with the fabulous secret drug that
at such a distance of time had killed the Grand Turk's brother;
and, as a consequence, he had made great profit by the sale of what
he alleged was the same poison&mdash;a subtle <i>veneno a
termine</i>, as he called it&mdash;so convenient for wives who were
anxious for a change of husbands, so serviceable to husbands grown
weary of their wives.</p>
<p>He understood at last that Cesare, informed of the defamatory
lie that had procured the mage such profit, had sought him out to
punish him. And it is a fact that Corvinus himself, despite his
considerable knowledge, actually believed in the drug's fabulous
power to slay at such a distance of time. He had found the recipe
in an old MS volume, with many another kindred prescription, and he
believed it with all the blind credulity of the Cinquecento in such
matters, with in fact, all the credulity of those who came to seek
his magician's aid.</p>
<p>The Duke's sinister mockery, the extraordinary sense which he
ever conveyed of his power to compel, of the futility of attempting
to resist his commands, filled Corvinus with an abject dread.</p>
<p>'Highness...alas!...I fear it may be as you say!' he cried.</p>
<p>'But even so, of what are you afraid? Come, man, you are
trifling! Have you not said of this elixir that it will restore the
dead to life? I pledge you my word that I shall see that it is
administered to you when you are dead. Come, then; swallow me this
powder, and see that you die of it precisely a fortnight hence, or,
by my soul's salvation, I'll have you hanged for an impostor
without giving you the benefit afterwards of your own dose of
resurrection.'</p>
<p>'My lord&mdash;my lord!' groaned the unfortunate man.</p>
<p>'Now, understand me,' said the Duke. 'If this powder acts as you
say it will, and kills you at the appointed time, your own elixir
shall be given to you to bring you back again to life. But if it
kills you sooner, you may remain dead; and if it kills you not at
all&mdash;why, then I'll hang you, and publish the truth of the
whole matter, that men may know the falsehood of the manner of
Djem's death upon which you have been trading! Refuse me,
and&mdash;'</p>
<p>The Duke's gesture was significant.</p>
<p>Corvinus looked into the young man's beautiful, relentless eyes,
and saw that to hope to turn him from his purpose were worse than
idle. As soon, then, risk the powder as accept the certainty of the
rope, with perhaps a foretaste of hell upon the rack. Besides, some
chemical skill he had, and a timely emetic might save
him&mdash;that and flight. Which shows the precise extent of his
faith in his elixir of life.</p>
<p>With trembling hands he took the powder.</p>
<p>'See that you spill none of it,' Cesare admonished him 'or the
strangler shall valet you, Thrice-Mage!'</p>
<p>'My lord, my lord!' quavered the wretched warlock, his eyes
bulging. 'Mercy! I...'</p>
<p>'The poison, or the strangler,' said the Duke.</p>
<p>In despair, and yet heartening himself by the thought of the
emetic, Corvinus bore the edge of the box to his ashen lips, and
emptied into his mouth the faintly musty contents, Cesare watching
him closely the while. When it was done, the appalled magician sank
limply to his chair.</p>
<p>The Duke laughed softly, replaced his visor, and, flinging his
ample cloak about him, strode towards the curtains that masked the
door.</p>
<p>'Sleep easily, Thrice-Mage,' he said, with infinite mockery. 'I
shall not fail you.'</p>
<p>Watching him depart, so confidently, so utterly fearless and
unconcerned, Corvinus was assailed by rage and a fierce temptation
to extinguish the light and try conclusions with Cesare in the
dark, summoning the Nubian to his aid. It was with that thought in
his mind that he smote the gong. But, whilst the note of it still
rang upon the air, he abandoned a notion so desperate. It would not
save him if he were poisoned, whilst if he allowed Cesare to depart
unmolested he would be the sooner gone, and the sooner Cesare were
gone the sooner would Corvinus be free to administer himself the
emetic that was now his only hope.</p>
<p>The curtains flashed back, and the Nubian appeared. On the
threshold Cesare paused, and over his shoulder, ever mocking, he
flung the warlock his valediction:</p>
<p>'Fare you well, Thrice-Mage!' he said; and, with a laugh, passed
out.</p>
<p>Corvinus dashed wildly to his shelves in quest of that emetic,
fiercely cursing the Duke of Valentinois and all the Borgia
brood.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>As the Nubian opened the door of the mage's house to give egress
to the Duke, he felt himself suddenly caught about the neck in the
crook of a steely, strangling arm, whilst the shrill note of a
whistle sounded almost in his very ear.</p>
<p>Instantly the hitherto silent and deserted street awoke to life.
From out of doorways darted swift-footed men in answer to the
Duke's summons. Into the hands of two of these he delivered the
Nubian; to the others he issued a brief command, 'In!' he said,
waving a hand down the passage. 'In, and take him.' And upon that
he stepped out into the street and so departed.</p>
<p>Later that evening word was brought him at the palace of how
Messer Corvinus had been taken in the very act of mixing a
drug.</p>
<p>'The antidote, no doubt,' said Cesare to the officer who bore
him the information. 'You would be just in time to save my
experiment from being frustrated. A wicked, faithless,
inconsiderate fellow, this Corvinus. Let him be kept in close
confinement, guarded by men whom you can trust, until you hear from
me again.'</p>
<p>Thereafter Cesare summoned a council of his
officers&mdash;Corella the Venetian, Naldo the Forlivese, Ramiro de
Lorqua, his lieutenant-general of Romagna, Della Volpe the
one-eyed, and Lorenzo Castrocaro.</p>
<p>A tall, clean-limbed young man was this last, very proud in his
bearing, very splendid in his apparel, with golden hair and
handsome, dreamy eyes of a blue as dark as sapphires. Cesare held
him in great regard, knowing him valiant, resourceful, and
ambitious. Tonight he regarded him with a fresh interest, in view
of what at the magician's he had overheard.</p>
<p>The Duke waved his officers to their seats about his council
board, and craved of Della Volpe, who was in charge of the siege
operations, news of the fortress of San Leo.</p>
<p>The veteran's swarthy face was gloomy. His single eye&mdash;he
had lost the other in the Duke's service&mdash;avoided his master's
penetrating glance. He sighed wearily.</p>
<p>'We make no progress,' he confessed, 'nor can make any. San Leo
is not a place to be carried by assault, as your magnificence well
knows. It stands there upon its mountaintop like a monument upon a
plinth, approached by a bridlepath offering no cover. And, for all
that it is reported to be held by scarcely more than a score of
men, a thousand cannot take it. There is no foothold at the summit
for more than a dozen men at a time, and as for using guns against
it, it were easier to mount a park of artillery upon a
fiddle-string.'</p>
<p>'Yet until San Leo is ours we are not fully masters of Urbino,'
said the Duke. 'We cannot leave the place in the hands of
Fioravanti.'</p>
<p>'We shall have to starve him out, then,' said Della Volpe.</p>
<p>'And that would take a year at least,' put in Corella, who had
been gathering information. 'They have great store of wheat and
other victuals and they are watered by a well in the inner bailie
of the fortress. With few mouths to feed, as they have, they can
hold us in check for ever.'</p>
<p>'There is a rumour today,' said Della Volpe, 'that the Lord
Fioravanti is sick, and that it is feared he may not live.'</p>
<p>'Not a doubt but Venice will say I poisoned him,' said Cesare,
sneering. 'Still, even if he dies, it will be no gain to us. There
is his castellan, Tolentino, to take his place; and Tolentino is
the more obstinate of the two. We must consider some way to reduce
them. Meanwhile, Taddeo, be vigilant, and hold the path against
all.'</p>
<p>Della Volpe inclined his head.</p>
<p>'I have taken all my measures for that,' he said.</p>
<p>And now young Castrocaro stirred in his chair, leaning forward
across the table.</p>
<p>'By your leave,' said he, 'those measures may not suffice.'</p>
<p>Della Volpe frowned, rolled his single eye, which was
preternaturally fierce, and scowled contemptuously upon this young
cockerel whose pretence it seemed to be to teach that war-battered
old captain the art of beleaguering.</p>
<p>'There is another way to reach San Leo,' Castrocaro explained;
and drew upon himself the attention of all, particularly the Duke,
in whose fine eyes there gleamed now an eager interest very unusual
in him.</p>
<p>Castrocaro met with a confident smile this sudden and general
alertness he had provoked.</p>
<p>'It is not,' he explained, 'such a way by which a company can
go, but sufficient to enable a bold man who is acquainted with it
to bear messages, and, at need, even victuals into the fortress.
Therefore, it will be necessary that Messer della Volpe surround
the entire base of the rock if he would be sure that none shall
slip through his lines.'</p>
<p>'You are certain of what you tell us?' quoth the Duke
sharply.</p>
<p>'Certain!' echoed Castrocaro; and he smiled. 'The way of which I
speak lies mainly to the south of the rock. It is perilous even for
a goat, yet it is practicable with care to one who knows it.
Myself, as a boy, have made the ascent more often than I should
have cared to tell my mother. In quest of an eagle's nest I have
more than once reached the little plateau that thrusts out under
the very wall of the fortress on the southern side. Thence, to
enter the castle, all that would be needed would be a rope and a
grappling hook; for the wall is extremely low just there&mdash;not
more than twelve feet high.'</p>
<p>The Duke pondered the young soldier with very thoughtful eyes,
in silence, for some moments.</p>
<p>'I shall further consider this,' he said at length. 'Meanwhile,
I thank you for the information. You have heard, Della Volpe. You
will profit by what Castrocaro tells us, encircling the base
entirely with your troops.'</p>
<p>Della Volpe bowed, and upon that the council rose.</p>
<p>Next morning Cesare Borgia summoned Castrocaro to his presence.
He received the young condottiero in the noble library of the
palace, a spacious chamber, its lofty ceiling gloriously frescoed
by Mantegna, its walls hung with costly tapestries and cloth of
gold, its shelves stocked with a priceless and imposing array of
volumes, all in manuscript; for, although the new German invention
of the printing press was already at work, by not a single vulgar
production of that machine would Duke Guidobaldo have contaminated
his cherished and marvellous collection.</p>
<p>At work at a table spread with papers sat the black-gowned
figure of Agabito Gherardi, the Duke's secretary.</p>
<p>'You have the acquaintance, have you not,' quoth Cesare, 'of
Madonna Bianca, the daughter of Fioravanti of San Leo?'</p>
<p>The young man, taken by surprise, flushed slightly despite his
habitual self-possession, and his blue eyes, avoiding the Duke's,
considered the summer sky and the palace gardens through one of the
windows that stood open to the broad marble balcony.</p>
<p>'I have that honour in some slight degree,' he answered; and
Cesare considered from his air and tone that the magician's golden
elixir was scarcely needed here as urgently as Madonna Bianca
opined, and that what still was wanting to enchant him the sorcery
of her beauty might accomplish unaided, as the magician had
supposed.</p>
<p>He smiled gently.</p>
<p>'You may improve that acquaintance, if you so desire.'</p>
<p>The young man threw back his head very haughtily.</p>
<p>'I do not understand your potency,' said he.</p>
<p>'You have my leave,' the Duke explained, 'to convey in person to
Madonna Bianca the news we have received that her father lies sick
in San Leo.'</p>
<p>Still the young man held himself loftily upon the defensive, as
a young lover will.</p>
<p>'To what end this, highness?' he inquired, his tone still
haughty.</p>
<p>'Why, to what end but a Christian one, and'&mdash;the Duke
slightly lowered his voice to a confidential tone, and smiled
inscrutably&mdash;'a kindly purpose towards yourself. Still, if you
disdain the latter, for the former any other messenger will
serve.'</p>
<p>Ill at ease in his self-consciousness, a little mystified, yet
well-content at heart, the condottiero bowed.</p>
<p>'I thank your highness,' he said. 'Have I your leave to go?'</p>
<p>The Duke nodded.</p>
<p>'You will wait upon me on your return. I may have other commands
for you,' he said, and so dismissed him.</p>
<p>An hour later came Castrocaro back to the palace library in
great haste and some excitement to seek the duke again.</p>
<p>'My lord,' he cried, all in a trembling eagerness, 'I have
conveyed the message, and I am returned to crave a boon. Madonna
Bianca besought of me in her affliction a written order to pass the
lines of Della Volpe, that she might repair to her father.'</p>
<p>'And you?' cried the Duke sharply, his level brows drawn
together by a sudden frown.</p>
<p>The young captain's glance fell away. Obviously he was
discouraged and abashed.</p>
<p>'I answered that I had no power to grant such an order,
but&mdash;but that I would seek it of your highness; that I knew
you would not desire to hold a daughter from her father's side at
such time.'</p>
<p>'You know a deal,' said Cesare sourly, 'and you promise rashly.
Precipitancy in making promises has never yet helped a man to
greatness. Bear that in mind.'</p>
<p>'But she was in such sore affliction!' cried Messer Lorenzo,
protesting.</p>
<p>'Aye!' said the Duke dryly. 'And she used you so kindly, eyed
you so fondly, gave you such sweet wine to drink, that you had no
strength to resist her soft appeal.'</p>
<p>Cesare, watching his condottiero closely, observed the flicker
of the young man's eyelids at the mention of the wine, and was
satisfied. But even more fully was he to have the assurance that he
sought.</p>
<p>'Have I been spied upon?' quoth Messer Lorenzo hotly.</p>
<p>Cesare shrugged contemptuously, not deigning to reply.</p>
<p>'You have leave to go,' he said in curt dismissal.</p>
<p>But Messer Lorenzo was in a daring mood, and slow to obey. 'And
the authority for Madonna Bianca to join her father?' he asked.</p>
<p>'There are good reasons why none should enter San Leo at
present,' was the cold reply. 'Since you lay such store by it, I
regret the necessity to deny you. But in time of war necessity is
inexorable.'</p>
<p>Chagrined and downcast, the condottiero bowed and withdrew.
Having promised, and finding himself now unable to fulfil the
promise made to her over that cup of wine which she had brought him
with her own fair hands, he dared not present himself to her again.
Instead he dispatched a page to her with the unwelcome news of the
Duke's refusal.</p>
<p>Yet in this matter Cesare Borgia was oddly inconsistent. For
scarcely had Castrocaro left his presence than he turned to his
white-faced secretary.</p>
<p>'Write me three lines to Della Volpe,' said he, 'ordering that
if Madonna Bianca de' Fioravanti should attempt to steal through
his lines and gain San Leo, he is to offer her no hindrance.'</p>
<p>Agabito's round, pale countenance reflected his amazement at
this order. But Cesare, surveying him, smiled inscrutably for all
reply, and, from his knowledge of his master and that smile,
Agabito perceived that Cesare was embarked upon one of those
tortuous, subtle courses whose goal none could perceive until it
had been reached. He bent to his task, and his pen scratched and
spluttered briskly. Very soon a messenger bearing the order was on
his way to Della Volpe's camp.</p>
<p>That very night Madonna Bianca considerately did what the Duke
expected of her. She slipped past the Borgia sentinels in the dark,
and she was in San Leo by morning, though in Urbino none knew of
this but Cesare, who had word of it privately from Della Volpe. Her
palace by the Zoccolanti remained opened as if inhabited by her,
but to all who came to seek her it was said that she was in
ill-health and kept her chamber. And amongst these was Lorenzo
Castrocaro, who, upon being denied admittance on this plea,
concluded that she was angry with him for having failed to do as he
had promised, and thereafter grew oddly silent and morose.</p>
<p>Two days after her flight came news of Fioravanti's death in the
grim fortress he defended, and Castrocaro was dispatched by the
Duke to Cesena on a mission which might well have been entrusted to
a less-important officer. It was ten days later when his immediate
return was ordered, and, in view of the terms of that order, he
went, upon reaching Urbino, all dust-laden as he was, into the
Duke's presence with the dispatches that he bore.</p>
<p>Valentinois sat in council at the time, and Della Volpe from the
lines under San Leo was in attendance.</p>
<p>'You are very opportunely returned,' was his greeting of Messer
Lorenzo, and he thrust aside, as of no consequence, the dispatches
which the latter brought. 'We are met here to consider this
resistance of San Leo, which is being conducted now by Tolentino
with all the firmness that was Fioravanti's. We must make an end;
and you, Messer Lorenzo, are the man to accomplish it.'</p>
<p>'I?' cried the young soldier.</p>
<p>'Sit,' Cesare bade him, and obediently Castrocaro took a chair
at the table. 'Listen. You are to understand that I am not
commanding you to do this thing, for I command no valued officer of
mine so greatly to imperil his life. I but show you what is our
need&mdash;what might be done by one who has your knowledge and
whose heart is stout enough to bid him take the risk which the
thing entails.'</p>
<p>The condottiero nodded his understanding, his blue eyes set upon
the Duke's calm face.</p>
<p>'You told us here,' Cesare continued, 'of a perilous way into
San Leo which is known to few, and to yourself amongst those few.
You said that if a man were to gain the plateau on the southern
side of the rock's summit he might, with a rope and a grappling
hook, effect an entrance. Now, if a man were to do this at dead of
night, choosing his time wisely so as to take the sentry unawares,
stab that sentry, and thereafter reach the gates and loose the
bars, the rest would be an easy task. Della Volpe's troops would,
meanwhile, have crept up by the bridlepath to await the signal,
upon which they would pour forth against the unbarred gate, and so
San Leo might be reduced at last with little loss of life.'</p>
<p>Messer Lorenzo considered for some moments, the Duke watching
him.</p>
<p>'It is shrewd,' he said, approvingly. 'It is shrewd and easy,
and likely to succeed, provided the man who goes is one who knows
the rock and the fortress itself.'</p>
<p>'Provided that, of course,' said Cesare; and he looked steadily
at the young man.</p>
<p>Messer Lorenzo bore that look a moment with the self-possession
that was natural to him. Then, translating its quiet
significance:</p>
<p>'I will go,' he said quietly, 'and, Heaven helping me, I will
succeed.'</p>
<p>'You have counted the cost of failure?' said Cesare.</p>
<p>'It needs no counting. It is plain enough. A rope and a beam
from the castle wall, or a leap from the rock itself.'</p>
<p>'Then, since who gambles should know not only what he may chance
to lose, but also the stake he stands to win,' said the Duke, 'let
me say that if you succeed I'll give you the governorship of the
fortress with a stipend of ten thousand ducats.'</p>
<p>Messer Lorenzo flushed in his agreeable surprise. His eyes
sparkled and his tone rang with youth's ready confidence in its own
powers.</p>
<p>'I will not fail,' he promised. 'When do I make the
attempt?'</p>
<p>'Tomorrow night, since you have resolved. See that you rest
betwixt this and then to fit you for the fatigue of such an
enterprise. And so, sirs, let us hope that we have found at last a
solution to this riddle of San Leo.'</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>You see, I hope, what Messer Castrocaro did not yet see, nor for
that matter ever saw&mdash;knowing nothing of what had happened on
the night when the duke visited Messer Corvinus Trismegistus. You
see in the Duke's choice of him for this enterprise an instance of
that fine discrimination with which Cesare picked his
instruments.</p>
<p>Macchiavelli, who studied the Duke at close quarters, and who
worshipped him as the very embodiment of all the virtues of
princeship, was no doubt inspired by the duke's unerring wisdom in
the choice of ministers to devote to the subject a chapter of his
'The Prince'.</p>
<p>'The first conjecture made of a prince and of his intellectual
capacity,' he writes, 'should be based upon a consideration of the
men by whom he surrounds himself, and when these are faithful to
him, and sufficient for his occasions, he is to be accounted a wise
prince, for having chosen them sufficient and kept them
faithful.'</p>
<p>Macchiavelli writes thus no more than Cesare might, himself,
have written had he theorized upon princeship instead of practising
it. It is, indeed upon Cesare Borgia's practices&mdash;as
Macchiavelli half admits in one place&mdash;that the Florentine
founded his theories. So that it is hardly an over-statement to say
that whilst Macchiavelli wrote 'The Prince', Cesare Borgia was its
real author, since his were the conceptions and actions that
Macchiavelli converted into precepts.</p>
<p>You see him here selecting for this task one who although the
youngest among all his captains, was yet undoubtedly the most
sufficient for his particular need. And observe the quality of his
sufficiency. In a measure it was adventitious, depending upon
Castrocaro's chance acquaintance with that back way up the rock of
San Leo. But in a still greater measure it was the result of
Cesare's clever manipulation of circumstances.</p>
<p>If that is not yet quite clear to you, it shall become
abundantly so ere all is told. But do not fall into the error of
supposing that anything that befell was the result of chance. From
now onward all happens precisely as Cesare had designed. He had
discovered certain forces, and he had harnessed them to his needs,
setting them upon a course by him predetermined and marked out.</p>
<p>He realized that chance might disturb their career, and fling
them out of that course, but he did not depend upon chance to bear
them to the goal at which he aimed them.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the following day, thoroughly rested and
refreshed, Messer Lorenzo Castrocaro rode out of Urbino with a
bodyguard of a half-dozen of his men-at-arms and took the road to
Della Volpe's camp under San Leo. He arrived there without mishap
towards nightfall, and having supped with the commander of the
beleaguerers in the latter's tent, he thereafter completed his
preparations. Towards the third hour of night he set out alone upon
his perilous undertaking.</p>
<p>To lessen the risk of being perceived by any watcher in the
castle, he had dressed himself entirely in black, taking the
precaution to put on under his doublet a shirt of mail, which
whilst being dagger-proof, was yet so finely wrought that your two
cupped hands might contain it. He was armed with sword and dagger,
and bandolier-wise about his body, was coiled a rope, to which he
had attached a strong, double-pronged grappling hook very broad in
the bend, all swathed in straw. This had been carefully and firmly
adjusted upon his back, so that it should not hamper his
movements.</p>
<p>With Della Volpe he had concerted that the latter, at the head
of fifty men, should quietly approach the fortress by the
bridlepath, and, having gained the summit, lie concealed until the
gate should be opened by Castrocaro himself. Then they were
instantly to spring forward, and so effect an entrance.</p>
<p>It was a fine clear night of summer, and a full moon rode in the
heavens, rendering the landscape visible for miles. This was well
for the earlier part of Messer Lorenzo's climb; and before
midnight, by when he hoped to reach the summit, that moon would
have set, and darkness would lend him cover.</p>
<p>Alone, then, he set out, and made his way round to the southern
side of the great precipitous hill on the crest of which, like the
capital of a column, the bulk and towers of the fortress showed
grey in the white moonlight.</p>
<p>At first the ascent was easy, and he was able to go forward
swiftly; soon, however, the precipice grew more abrupt, the
foothold became scantier, and in places failed almost entirely, so
that his progress was retarded and for his life's sake he was
compelled to move with infinite caution, husbanding his strength
against the still more strenuous labour that lay before him.</p>
<p>Hesitation or doubt he had none. It was a good ten years since
last, in boyhood, he had scaled those heights; but boyhood's
memories are tenacious, and he was as confident of his way as if he
had trodden it but yesterday. Every little projection of that
cliff, every fissure that afforded foothold, every gap to be
overcome, he knew before he reached it.</p>
<p>At the end of an hour he had not accomplished more than a third
of the ascent, and the most difficult part of it was yet to come.
He sat down upon a grassy ledge, unusually spacious, and there he
rested him awhile and recovered breath.</p>
<p>Thence he viewed the Emilian plain, revealed for miles in the
moon's white light, the glittering, silvery spread of sea away in
the distance to the east, the glimmering snow-capped peaks of the
Apennines to westward. Above him towered the grey cliff, abrupt and
sheer as the very walls of the fortress that crowned its summit, a
climb that well might have appalled the hardiest mountaineer, that
might, indeed, have baffled even a goat. Surveying it with his calm
blue eyes, Messer Lorenzo realized that the worst danger he had to
face that night was the danger of this climb. By comparison, the
rest&mdash;the scaling of the castle wall, the poniarding of a
sentry or two, and the opening of the gate&mdash;were safe and
simple matters. Here, however, a false step, a misgiving even, or a
moment of giddiness, such as might well beset him, must plunge him
down to instant death.</p>
<p>He rose, inhaled the fragrance of the summer night, breathed a
short prayer to his patron saint, the Holy Lawrence, and pushed on.
Clinging with hands and feet and knees to the face of the cliff, he
edged along a narrow strip of rock, for some few yards, to another
ledge; there he paused to breathe again, thankful that so much was
accomplished.</p>
<p>Thereafter for a while the going was easier. A natural path,
some three feet wide, wound upwards along the precipice's face. At
the end of this he was confronted by another gap, to be surmounted
only by a leap.</p>
<p>Fearing lest his sword should trip him, he unbuckled his belt,
and cast the weapon from him. He did so with regret, but
constrained to it by the reflection that if he kept it he might
never live to need it.</p>
<p>Then he took a deep breath, seized his courage in both hands,
and jumped across the black unfathomable void at a stunted tree
that thrust out from that sheer wall. With arms and legs he
clutched like an ape at the frail plant, and had its hold given way
under his weight, there would have been an end of him forthwith. It
held, however, and clinging to it, he groped for foothold, found
it, and went on.</p>
<p>This brought him to a narrow fissure in the cliff. Up this
fissure he swarmed, supported by just the pressure of knees and
forearms against the rock, and only at times finding a projection
affording a safer grip for one or the other.</p>
<p>Up, straight up, he went for nearly twenty feet, until at last
he reached the fissure's summit; one of its walls permitted him to
get astride it, and there he rested, bathed in sweat and winded by
the stupendous exertions he had put forth. Seated thus, his breast
close against the cliff, he looked sideways and down into the awful
depths below him. He shuddered, and clung with his bruised hands to
the rock, and it was some time before he could proceed upon the
second half of his ascent, for by now he knew that he was a good
midway.</p>
<p>At last he resumed his climb, and by similar means, and
surmounting similar and constant perils, he pushed on and ever
upwards.</p>
<p>One narrow escape he had. As he clung with both hands to that
awful wall at a place where the foothold was but a few inches wide,
a great brown body, with a shrieking whirr, dashed out of a crevice
just above his head, and went cawing and circling in the void
beyond. So startled was he that he almost loosed his hold, and a
cold sweat broke out upon his roughened skin as he recovered and
knew the thing for what it was. And later, when, an hour or so
before midnight, the moon went down and left him in utter darkness,
fear at last assailed his stout spirit, and for a time he did not
dare to move. Presently, however, as he grew accustomed to the
gloom, his eyes were able to pierce it to an extent that restored
his courage. The night, after all, was clear and starlit, and at
close quarters objects were just visible; yet immense care was
necessary lest he should now commit the irreparable error of
mistaking substance for shadow, or should misjudge his distances,
as was so easy.</p>
<p>At long length, towards midnight, utterly spent, with bleeding
hands and rent garments, he found himself on the roomy platform at
the very foot of the castle's southern wall; and not for all the
wealth of the world would he have consented to return by the way he
had so miraculously ascended&mdash;for miraculous did he now
account it that he should have reached his goal in safety. He flung
himself down, full length, there at the foot of the wall, to rest
awhile before attempting the escalade. And what time he rested, he
whispered a prayer of thankfulness for his preservation so far, for
a devout soul was this Messer Lorenzo.</p>
<p>He looked up at the twinkling stars, out at the distant sheen of
the Adriatic, down at the clustering hamlets in the plain, so far
below him, from which so painfully he had climbed. Immediately
above his head he could hear the steady measured tread of the
sentry, approaching, passing, and receding again, as the man
patrolled the embattled parapet. Thrice did the fellow pass that
way before Castrocaro stirred; and when at length he rose, as the
steps were fading in the distance for the third time, he felt a
certain pity for the soldier whose spirit he must inevitably
liberate from its earthly prison-house that night.</p>
<p>He uncoiled the rope from his body, stood back, and swung the
grappling hook a moment, taking aim, then hurled it upwards. It
soared above the wall, and fell beyond, between two merlons, then
thudded softly against the masonry, the straw in which he had the
foresight to swathe it muffling the sound of the metal.</p>
<p>He pulled gently at the rope, hoping that the hooks would fasten
upon some projection in the stone or lodge within some crevice. But
neither happened. The hooks came to the summit of the wall, and
toppled back, falling at his feet. Again he repeated the operation,
with a like result; but at the third attempt the hooks took hold.
He swung his entire weight upon the rope to test the grip, and
found that it held firmly.</p>
<p>But now the sentry's return warned him that the moment was
unpropitious. So he waited, intently listening, crouching at the
wall's foot, until the man had passed, and his footsteps were once
more receding in the distance.</p>
<p>Then he began the ascent in sailor fashion, hauling himself up
hand over hand, his feet against the masonry to lighten the labour
of his arms. Thus he came swiftly to the top of the wall, and knelt
there, between two merlons, peering down into the black courtyard.
All was silent. Save for the tramp of the sentry, who was now
turning the north-western angle of the ramparts, as Messer Lorenzo
rightly judged, no sound disturbed the stillness of the place.</p>
<p>He loosed the hooks from the crevice in which they had fastened.
He flung them wide, the rope with them, and sent them hurtling over
the precipice, that there might be no evidence of the manner of his
coming. Then he dropped softly down upon the parapet, exulting to
realize that his journey was accomplished, and that he was within
the fortress.</p>
<p>His mission was all but ended. The rest was easy. Within a few
moments the Borgia troops would be pouring into San Leo, and the
soldiers of the garrison, surprised in their beds, would make a
very ready surrender. It no longer appeared even necessary to
Messer Lorenzo to butcher that single sentry. If he but wisely
chose his moment for the unbarring of the gates, the whole thing
might be done without the man's suspicions being aroused until it
was too late. Indeed, it was the safer course; for, after all, if
he came to grapple with the soldier, there was always the chance
that the fellow might cry out and give the alarm before Castrocaro
could dispatch him.</p>
<p>Resolved thus upon that score, he moved forward swiftly yet very
cautiously, and gained a flight of stone steps that wound down into
the inner bailie. This he descended, and so reached the quadrangle.
Round this vast square he moved, keeping well within the shadows,
until he came to the gateway opening upon a passage that ran past
the guard-room on one side and the chapel on the other, into the
outer bailie of the fortress.</p>
<p>In this gateway he crouched, and waited until the sentry, who
was coming round again, should have passed once more to the castles
northern side. No window overlooking the courtyard showed a single
light; the place was wrapped in slumber.</p>
<p>Messer Lorenzo waited calmly, his pulse quite regular. Should
the door be locked, then he must return, deal with the sentry, and
make his way to the main gates by the battlements. But it was
unlikely that such would be the case.</p>
<p>High up, immediately before him upon the ramparts, he saw the
sentry, passing slowly, pike on shoulder, a black shadow dimly
outlined against the blue-black, star-flecked dome of sky. He
watched him as he passed on and round, all unsuspicious, and so
vanished once more. Then, very softly, Messer Lorenzo tried the
latch of that big door. It yielded silently to his pressure and a
black tunnel gaped before him. He entered it, and very softly
closed the door again on the inside. Then he paused, reflecting
that were he to go straight forward and pass out into the northern
court he must risk detection by the sentry, who was now on the
northern battlements. Therefore he must wait until the fellow
should come round again.</p>
<p>Interminable seemed his wait this time, and once he fancied that
he heard a man's voice coming from the guard-room on his right. The
sound momentarily quickened his pulses that had been steady
hitherto. But hearing no more, he concluded that his senses,
strained by so much dodging, waiting, and listening, had deceived
him.</p>
<p>At last he caught the sound of the sentry's step approaching
again along the parapet. Satisfied that he had waited long enough
he made shift to grope his way through the black darkness of that
passage. And then, even as he turned, his heart almost stood still.
Upon the chapel door, at the height of some three feet, there was a
tiny oval splash of light, along the ground at the same spot a
yellow gleam long and narrow as a sword-blade. Instantly he
understood. The guard-room, whose windows looked upon the northern
court, was still tenanted, and what he beheld was the light that
shone through the keyhole and under the door.</p>
<p>A moment he paused, considering. Then he perceived that, having
come so far, he must go on. To retreat and reopen the door would be
fraught with the greater risk, whilst to linger in the passage
would be but to increase the already imminent danger of discovery.
His only chance of winning through lay in going forward at once,
taking care to make no sound that should reach those within. Thus,
no doubt, all would be well. With extremest caution, then, he
stepped forward on tip-toe, his hands upon the wall on the chapel
side to guide and steady him.</p>
<p>Not more than three of four steps had he taken when, quite
suddenly, an oath rang out in a deep male voice, followed by the
laughter of several men. With that there was a scraping of chairs,
and heavy steps came tramping towards the door.</p>
<p>With this door Messer Lorenzo was now level, and, being
startled, he made his one mistake. Had he taken the risk of
speeding forward swiftly, he might even now have won safely the
outer bailie. But he hung there hesitating, again considering
retreat even, his every sinew taut. And that pause was his ruin. In
a moment he realized it, saw that he was trapped, that retreat was
now utterly hopeless, and that to go forward was no better.
Therefore with set teeth, and angry misery in his soul to reflect
that he had won so far and at such peril only to fail upon the very
threshold of success, he stood at bay, to meet what he no longer
could avoid.</p>
<p>The door was pulled open from within, and a flood of light
poured out into that black place, revealing Messer Lorenzo, white
of face, with staring eyes, one hand instinctively upon his
poniard-hilt, poised there as if for a spring.</p>
<p>Thus did the foremost of the five men who issued behold him, and
at sight of him all checked abruptly, staring. This foremost one, a
big, heavily-built fellow all clad in leather, black-browed and
bearded, seemed in some slight measure the superior of those other
four. All five were very obviously soldiers.</p>
<p>He fell back a step in sheer amazement, startled even by the
sight of Messer Lorenzo. Then, recovering, he set his arms akimbo,
planted wide his feet, and looked our gentleman over with an eye of
deepest interest. 'Now who the devil may you be?' he demanded.</p>
<p>Messer Lorenzo's wits were ever very ready, and in that moment
he had a flash of inspiration. He stepped forward easily in answer
to that challenge, and so came more fully into the light.</p>
<p>'I am glad to see there is someone alive and awake in San Leo,'
he said; and he seemed to sneer, as one who had the right to utter
a reproof.</p>
<p>On the faces of those five men amazement grew and spread.
Looking beyond them into the room, which was lighted by torches set
in iron sconces in the walls, Messer Lorenzo beheld the explanation
of the silence they had kept. There was a table on which remained
spread a pack of greasy cards. They had been at play.</p>
<p>'Body of God,' he went on, 'you keep a fine watch here! The
Borgia soldiery may be at your very gates. I myself can effect an
entrance, and no man to hinder or challenge me, or so much as give
the alarm! By the Host! were you men of mine, I should find work
for you in the kitchen, and hope that you'd give a better account
of yourselves as scullions than you do as soldiers.'</p>
<p>'Now, who the devil may you be, I say?' again demanded the
black-browed warrior, scowling more truculently than before.</p>
<p>'And how the devil come you here?' cried another, a slender,
loose-lipped fellow, with a wart on his nose, who pushed forward to
survey the intruder at closer quarters.</p>
<p>Castrocaro on the instant became very haughty</p>
<p>'Take me to your captain&mdash;to Messer Tolentino,' he
demanded. 'He shall learn what manner of watch you keep. You dogs,
the place might be burnt about your ears while you sit there
cheating one another at cards, and set a fellow who appears to be
both deaf and blind to pace your walls.'</p>
<p>The note of cool authority in his voice produced its effect.
They were entirely duped by it. That a man should so address them
whose right to do so was not entirely beyond question seemed to
them&mdash;as it might indeed to any&mdash;altogether
incredible.</p>
<p>'Messer Tolentino is abed,' said the big fellow in a surly
voice.</p>
<p>They did not like the laugh with which Messer Castrocaro
received that information. It had an unpleasant ring.</p>
<p>'I nothing doubt it from the manner of your watch,' he sneered.
'Well, then, up and rouse him for me!'</p>
<p>'But who is he, after all, Bernardo?' insisted the loose-lipped
stripling of their leader; and the others grunted their approval of
a question that at least possessed the virtue of being timely.</p>
<p>'Aye,' quoth black-browed Bernardo. 'You have not told us who
you are?' His tone lay between truculence and sulky deference.</p>
<p>'I am an envoy from the Lord Guidobaldo, your duke,' was the
ready and unfaltering answer; and the young condottiero wondered in
his heart whither all this would lead him, and what chance of
saving himself might offer yet.</p>
<p>Their deference was obviously increased, as was their interest
in him.</p>
<p>'But how came you in?' insisted the one who already had posed
that question.</p>
<p>Messer Lorenzo waved the question and questioner impatiently
aside.</p>
<p>'What matters that?' quoth he. 'Enough that I am here. Are we to
trifle away the night in silly questions? Have I not told you that
the Borgia troops may at this moment be at your very gates?'</p>
<p>'By Bacchus, they may stay there,' laughed another. The gates of
San Leo are strong enough, my master; and should the Borgia rabble
venture to knock, we shall know how to answer them.'</p>
<p>But even as the fellow was speaking, Bernardo fetched a lanthorn
from the room, and shouted to them to follow him. They went down
the passage towards the door leading to the outer bailie. They
crossed the courtyard together, pestering the supposed envoy with
questions, which he answered curtly and ungraciously, showing them
by his every word and gesture that it was not his habit to herd
with such as they.</p>
<p>Thus they came to the door of the maschio tower, where Messer
Tolentino had his dwelling; and, what time they paused there,
Castrocaro sent a fond glance in the direction of the great gates,
beyond which Della Volpe and his men were waiting. He was so near
them that to reach and unbar those gates would be an instant's
work; but the way to rid himself of those five dogs of war was
altogether beyond his devising. And now the sentry on the walls
above peered down and hailed them to know whom they had with them,
and the young condottiero prayed that thus Della Volpe, who must be
intently on the watch without, might have warning that he was
taken. Yet at the same time he knew full well that, even so, Della
Volpe would be powerless to assist him. He had but his own wits
upon which he could depend and he realized how desperate was his
situation.</p>
<p>Up a winding staircase, the walls and ceilings very rudely
frescoed, they led Messer Lorenzo to the apartments of Tolentino,
the castellan who had been ruler of San Leo since the death, ten
days ago, of the Lord Fioravanti.</p>
<p>As he went the young condottiero took heart once more. So far
all had gone well. He had played his part shrewdly, and his
demeanour had so successfully imposed upon the men that no shadow
of suspicion did they entertain. Could he but succeed in similarly
befooling their captain, it might well be that he should be
assigned some chamber from which he anon might slip forth still to
do the thing he was come to do.</p>
<p>As he went he prepared the tale he was to tell, and he based it
upon his knowledge that Fioravanti's resistance of Cesare Borgia
had been almost in opposition to the wishes of Duke
Guidobaldo&mdash;that mild and gentle scholar who had desired all
fortresses to make surrender, since no ultimate gain could lie in
resistance and naught ensue but a useless sacrifice of life.</p>
<p>The difficulty for Messer Lorenzo lay in the fact that Tolentino
would desire to see credentials; and he had none to offer.</p>
<p>He was kept waiting in an ante-chamber what time the big
Bernardo went to rouse the castellan and to inform that grumbling
captain that an envoy from Duke Guidobaldo had stolen into the
castle and was seeking him. No more than just that did Bernardo
tell Tolentino. But it was enough.</p>
<p>The castellan roused himself at once, with a wealth of oaths,
first incoherent, then horribly coherent; he shook his great
night-capped head, thrust out a pair of long hairy legs from the
coverlet, and sat up on the bed's edge to receive this envoy, whom
he made Bernardo to admit.</p>
<p>Messer Lorenzo, very uneasy in his heart, but very haughty and
confident in his bearing, entered and gave the captain a lofty
salutation.</p>
<p>'You are from Duke Guidobaldo?' growled Messer Tolentino.</p>
<p>'I am,' said Castrocaro. 'And had I been from Cesare Borgia,
with a score of men at my heels, I could by now have been master of
San Leo, so zealous are your watchers.'</p>
<p>It was shrewdly conceived, because it seemed to state an obvious
truth that was well calculated to disarm suspicion. But the tone he
took though well enough with men-at-arms, was a mighty dangerous
one to take with a castellan of such importance and such a fierce,
ungovernable temper as was notoriously Messer Tolentino's. It flung
that gentleman very naturally into a rage, and might well have
earned the speaker a broken head upon the instant. This Messer
Lorenzo knew and risked; for he also knew that it must earn him
confidence, both for the reason already given and also because it
must be inferred that only a person very sure of himself would dare
to voice such a reproof.</p>
<p>Tolentino stared at him out of fierce, blood-injected eyes, too
much taken aback to find an answer for a moment. He was a tall,
handsome, big-nosed man, with black hair, an olive, shaven face,
and a long, square chin. He stared on awhile, and then
exploded.</p>
<p>'Blood of God!' he roared. 'Here is a cockerel with a very noisy
cackle! We'll mend that for you ere you leave us,' he promised
viciously. 'Who are you?'</p>
<p>'An envoy from Duke Guidobaldo, as you have been informed. As
for the rest&mdash;the cockerel and the cackle&mdash;we will
discuss it at some other time.'</p>
<p>The castellan heaved himself up and sought to strike a pose of
dignity, no easy matter for a man in his shirt and crowned by a
nightcap.</p>
<p>'You pert lap-dog!' said he, between anger and amazement. He
breathed gustily, words failing him, and then grew calmer. 'What is
your name?'</p>
<p>'Lorenzo Snello,' answered Castrocaro, who had been prepared for
the question, and he added sternly: 'I like it better than the one
you have just bestowed upon me.'</p>
<p>'Are you come hither to tell me what you like?' bellowed the
castellan. 'Look you, young sir, I am the master here, and here my
will is law. I can flog you, flay you, or hang you, and give
account of it to none. Bear you that in mind, and&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Oh, peace!' cried Messer Lorenzo, in his turn, waving a
contemptuous hand, and dominating the other by his very tone and
manner. 'Whatever I may have come for, I have not come to listen to
your vapourings. Have I climbed from the plain, risked my life to
get through the Borgia lines, and my neck a score of times in the
ascent, to stand here and have you bellow at me of what you imagine
you can do? What you cannot do, I have seen for myself.'</p>
<p>'And what may that be?' quoth Tolentino, now wickedly
gentle.</p>
<p>'You cannot guard a castle, and you cannot discriminate between
a lackey and one who is your peer and perhaps something more.'</p>
<p>The castellan sat down again and rubbed his chin. Here was a
very hot fellow, and, like all bullies, Messer Tolentino found that
hot fellows put him out of countenance.</p>
<p>In the background, behind Messer Lorenzo, stood Tolentino's men
in line, silent but avid witnesses of his discomfiture. The
castellan perceived that at all costs he must save his face.</p>
<p>'You'll need a weighty message to justify this insolence and to
save you from a whipping,' said he gravely.</p>
<p>'I'll need no weightier a message than the one I bear,' was the
sharp answer. 'The duke shall hear of these indignities to which
you are subjecting one he loves, and who has run great peril in his
service.'</p>
<p>His dignity, his air of injury was now overwhelming. 'And mark
you, sir, it is not the way to treat an envoy, this. Were my duty
to the duke less than it is, or my message of less moment, I should
depart as I have come. But he shall hear of the reception I have
had, rest assured of that.'</p>
<p>Tolentino shuffled, ill at ease now.</p>
<p>'Sir,' he cried, protesting, 'I swear the fault is yours. Who
pray are you, to visit me with your reproofs? If I have failed in
courtesy it was you provoked me. Am I to bear the gibes of every
popinjay who thinks he can discharge my duties better than can I?
Enough, sir!' He waved a great hand, growing dignified in his turn.
'Deliver the message that you bear.' And he held out that massive
hand of his in expectation of a letter.</p>
<p>But Messer Lorenzo's pretence was, of necessity, that he bore
his message by word of mouth.</p>
<p>'I am bidden by my lord to enjoin you to make surrender with the
honours of war, which shall be conceded you by the Duke of
Valentinois,' said he; and seeing the surprise, doubt, and
suspicion that instantly began to spread upon Tolentino's face for
all to read, he launched himself into explanations. 'Cesare Borgia
has made terms with Duke Guidobaldo, and has promised him certain
compensations if all the fortresses of his dominions make surrender
without more ado. These terms my lord has been advised to accept,
since by refusing them nothing can he hope to gain, whilst he may
lose all. Perceiving this, and satisfied that by prolonging its
resistance San Leo can only be postponing its ultimately inevitable
surrender and entailing by that postponement the loss of much
valuable life, Duke Guidobaldo has sent me to bid you in his name
capitulate forthwith.'</p>
<p>It had a specious ring. It was precisely such a message as the
humanitarian duke might well have sent, and the profit to accrue to
himself from the surrender he enjoined seemed also a likely enough
contingency. Yet the shrewd Tolentino had his doubts, doubts which
might never have assailed another.</p>
<p>Wrinkles increased about his fierce black eyes as he bent them
now upon the messenger.</p>
<p>'You will have letters of this tenour from my lord?' he
said.</p>
<p>'I have none,' replied Messer Lorenzo, dissembling his
uneasiness.</p>
<p>'Now, by Bacchus, that is odd!'</p>
<p>'Nay, sir, consider,' said the young man too hastily, 'the
danger of my carrying such letters. Should they be found upon me by
the Borgia troops, I&mdash;'</p>
<p>He checked, somewhat awkwardly, perceiving his mistake.
Tolentino smacked his thigh with his open palm, and the room rang
with the sound of it. His face grew red. He sprang up.</p>
<p>'Sir, sir,' said he, with a certain grimness, 'we must
understand each other better. You say that you bring me certain
orders to act upon a certain matter that has been concerted between
Valentinois and my lord, and you talk of danger to yourself in
bearing such orders in a letter. Be patient with me if I do not
understand.' Tolentino's accents were unmistakably sardonic. 'So
desirable is it from the point of view of Valentinois that such
commands should reach me, that he could not have failed to pass you
unmolested through his troops. Can you explain where I am wrong in
these conclusions?'</p>
<p>There but remained for Messer Lorenzo to put upon the matter the
best face possible. A gap was yawning at his feet. He saw it all
too plainly. He was lost, it seemed.</p>
<p>'That explanation, my lord, no doubt, will furnish you, should
you seek it from him. I hold it not. It was not given me, nor had I
the presumption to request it.' He spoke calmly and proudly, for
all that his heart-beats had quickened, and in his last words there
was a certain veiled reproof of the other's attitude. 'When,' he
continued, 'I said that it would have been dangerous to have given
me letters, I but put forward, to answer you, the explanation which
occurred to me at the moment. I had not earlier considered the
matter. I now see that I was wrong in my assumption.'</p>
<p>Messer Tolentino considered him very searchingly. Throughout his
speech, indeed, the castellan's eyes had never left his face.
Messer Lorenzo's words all but convinced Tolentino that the man was
lying. Yet his calm and easy assurance, his proud demeanour, left
the captain still a lingering doubt.</p>
<p>'At least you'll bear some sign by which I am to know that you
are indeed my lord's envoy?' said he.</p>
<p>'I bear none. I was dispatched in haste. The duke, it seems, did
not reckon upon such a message as this being doubted.'</p>
<p>'Did he not?' quoth Tolentino, and his note was sardonic.
Suddenly he asked another question. 'How came you to enter the
fortress?'</p>
<p>'I climbed up from the plain on the southern side, where the
rock is accounted inaccessible.' And, seeing the look of surprise
that overspread the captain's face, 'I am of these parts: he
explained. 'In boyhood I have frequently essayed the climb. It was
for this reason that Duke Guidobaldo chose me.'</p>
<p>'And when you had gained the wall, did you bid the sentry lower
you a rope?'</p>
<p>'I did not. I had a rope of my own, and grappling hooks.'</p>
<p>'Why this, when you are a messenger from Guidobaldo?' The
castellan turned sharply to his men. 'Where did you find him?' he
inquired.</p>
<p>It was Bernardo who made haste to answer that they had found him
lurking in the passage outside the guard-room as they were coming
out.</p>
<p>Tolentino laughed with fierce relish, and swore copiously and
humorously.</p>
<p>'So-ho!' he crowed. 'You had passed the sentry unperceived, and
you were well within the fortress ere suddenly you were discovered,
when, behold! you become a messenger of Guidobaldo's bearing orders
to me to surrender the fortress, and you take this high tone about
our indifferent watch to cover the sly manner of your entrance.
Oh-o! 'Twas shrewdly thought of, but it shall not avail
you&mdash;though it be a pity to wring the neck of so spirited a
cockerel.' And he laughed again.</p>
<p>'You are a fool,' said Castrocaro with finality, 'and you reason
like a fool.'</p>
<p>'Do I so? Now, mark me. You said that it was because you knew a
secret way into this castle that Guidobaldo chose you for his
messenger. Consider now the folly of that statement. You might
yourself have construed that Guidobaldo's wish was that you should
come hither secretly, though yourself you have admitted the obvious
error of such an assumption. But to tell me that an envoy from the
duke bidding us surrender to Cesare Borgia, and so do the will of
the latter, should need come here by secret ways at the risk of his
neck&mdash;' Tolentino shrugged and laughed in the white face of
Messer Lorenzo.</p>
<p>'Which of us is the fool in this, sir?' he questioned, leering.
Then, with an abrupt change of manner, he waved to his men. 'Seize
and search him,' he commanded.</p>
<p>In a moment they had him down upon the floor, and they were
stripping him of his garments. They made a very thorough search,
but it yielded nothing.</p>
<p>'No matter,' said Tolentino as he got into bed again. 'We have
more than enough against him already. Make him safe for the night.
He shall go down the cliff's face again in the morning, and I swear
he shall go down faster than ever he came up.'</p>
<p>And Messer Tolentino rolled over, and settled down comfortably
to go to sleep again.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>Locked in the guard-house&mdash;since a man who was to die so
soon was not worth the trouble of consigning to a dungeon, Messer
Lorenzo Castrocaro spent, as you may conceive, a somewhat troubled
night. He was too young and too full of life and the zest and
warmth of it to be indifferent about quitting it, to look with
apathy upon death. He had seen death and a deal of it&mdash;in the
past two years of his martial career. But it had been the death of
others, and never until now had it seemed to him that death was a
thing that very much concerned himself. Even when he had imagined
that he realized the dangers before him in this enterprise of San
Leo, he had felt a certain confidence that it was not for him to
die. He was, in fact, in that phase of youth and vigour when a man
seems to himself immortal. And even now that he lay on the wooden
bench in the guard-room, in the dark, he could hardly conceive that
the end of him was really at hand. The catastrophe had overtaken
him so suddenly, so very casually; and surely death was too great a
business to be heralded so quietly.</p>
<p>He sighed wearily, and sought to find a more comfortable
position on his pitilessly hard couch. He thought of many
things&mdash;of his past life, of early boyhood, of his mother, of
his companions in arms, and of martial feats accomplished. He saw
himself hacking a way through the living barrier that blocked the
breach in the wall of Forli, or riding with Valentinois in the
mighty charge that routed the Colonna under Capua; and he had a
singularly vivid vision of the dead men he had beheld on those
occasions and how they had looked in death. So would he look
tomorrow, his reason told him. But still his imagination refused to
picture it.</p>
<p>Then his thoughts shifted to Madonna Bianca de' Fioravanti, whom
he would never see again. For months he had experienced an odd
tenderness for that lady, of a sweetly melancholy order, and in
secret he had committed some atrocious verses in her honour.</p>
<p>It had been no great affair when all was said; there had been
other and more ardent loves in his short life; yet Madonna Bianca
had evoked in him a tenderer regard, a holier feeling than any
other woman that he had known. Indeed, the contrast was as sharp as
that which lies between sacred and profane love. Perhaps it was
because she was so unattainable, so distant, so immeasurably above
him, the daughter of a great lord, the representative today of a
great house, whilst he was but a condottiero, an adventurer who had
for patrimony no more than his wits and his sword. He sighed. It
would have been sweet to have seen her again before dying&mdash;to
have poured out the story of his love as a swan pours out its
deathsong. Yet, after all, it did not greatly matter.</p>
<p>You see that his examination of conscience in that supreme hour
had little to do with the making of his soul.</p>
<p>He wondered would she hear of the end he had made; and whether,
hearing, she would pity him a little; whether, indeed, she would do
so much as remember him. It was odd he reflected that he should
come to meet his end in the very castle that had been her father's;
yet he was glad that it was not her father's hand that measured out
to him this death that he must die tomorrow.</p>
<p>Physically exhausted as he was by the exertions of his climb, he
fell at last into a fitful slumber; and when next he awakened it
was to find the morning sunlight pouring through the tall windows
of his prison.</p>
<p>He had been aroused by the grating of a key in the lock, and as
he sat up, stiff and sore, on his hard couch, the door opened, and
to him entered Bernardo, followed by six soldiers, all in their
harness. 'A good day to you,' said Bernardo civilly, but a trifle
thoughtlessly, considering what the day had in store for Messer
Lorenzo.</p>
<p>The young man smiled as he swung his feet to the ground. 'A
better day to you,' said he; and thus earned by his pleasantry and
his debonair manner, the esteem of the gruff soldier.</p>
<p>It had come to Messer Lorenzo that, since die he must, the thing
would be best done jocosely. Lamentations would not avail him. Let
him then be blithe. Perhaps, after all, death were not so fearful a
business as priests represented it; and as for that flaming hell
that lies agape for young men who have drunk of the lusty cup of
their youth there would be shrift for him before he went.</p>
<p>He rose, and ran his fingers through his long, fair hair, which
had become tousled. Then he looked at his hands, grimy and bruised
from yesternight's adventure, and begged Bernardo to fetch him
water.</p>
<p>Bernardo's brows went up in surprise. The labour of washing did
not seem a reasonable thing to him under the circumstances. Outside
in the courtyard a drum began to beat a call. Bernardo thrust out a
dubious lip.</p>
<p>'Messer Tolentino is awaiting you,' he said.</p>
<p>'I know,' replied Castrocaro. 'You would not have me present
myself thus before him. It were to show a lack of proper respect
for the hangman.'</p>
<p>Bernardo shrugged, and gave an order to one of his men. The
fellow set his pike in a corner and went out, to return presently
with an iron basin full of water. This he placed upon the table.
Messer Lorenzo thanked him pleasantly, removed his doublet and
shirt, and stripped to the waist he proceeded to make the best
toilet that he could as briefly as possible.</p>
<p>Washed and refreshed, his garments dusted and their disarray
repaired, he acknowledged himself ready. The men surrounded him at
a word from Bernardo, marched him out into the open where the
impatient castellan awaited him.</p>
<p>With a firm step, his head high, and his cheeks but little paler
than their habit, Messer Lorenzo came into the spacious inner
bailie of the castle. He glanced wistfully at the cobalt sky, and
then considered the line of soldiers drawn up in the courtyard, all
in their harness of steel and leather, with the grey walls of the
fortress for their background. Not more than thirty men in all did
they number, and they composed the castle's entire garrison.</p>
<p>A little in front of them the tall castellan was pacing slowly.
He was all in black, in mourning for his late master, the Lord
Fioravanti, and his hand rested easily upon the hilt of his
sheathed sword, thrusting the weapon up behind. He halted at the
approach of the doomed prisoner, and the men surrounding the latter
fell away, leaving him face to face with Messer Tolentino.</p>
<p>The castellan considered him sternly for a little while, and
Messer Lorenzo bore the inspection well, his deep blue eyes
returning the other's solemn glance intrepidly.</p>
<p>At last the captain spoke:</p>
<p>'I do not know what was your intent in penetrating here last
night, save that it was traitorous; that much the lies you told me
have made plain, and for that you are to suffer death, as must any
man taken as you had been.'</p>
<p>'For death I am prepared,' said Messer Lorenzo coolly; 'but I
implore you to spare me the torture of a funeral oration before I
go. My fortitude may not be equal to so much, particularly when you
consider that I have had no breakfast.'</p>
<p>Tolentino smiled sourly, considering him.</p>
<p>'Very well,' said he. And then: 'You will not tell me who you
are and what you sought here?'</p>
<p>'I have told you already, but you choose to discredit what I
say. What need, then, for further words? It were but to weary you
and me. Let us get to the hanging, which, from the general look of
you, is no doubt a matter that you understand better.'</p>
<p>'Ha!' said Tolentino.</p>
<p>But now quite suddenly, from the line of men there was one who,
having heard question and answer, made bold to call out:</p>
<p>'Sir captain, I can tell you who he is.'</p>
<p>The captain wheeled sharply upon the man-at-arms who had made
the announcement.</p>
<p>'He is Messer Lorenzo Castrocaro.'</p>
<p>'One of Valentinois' condottieri?' exclaimed Tolentino.</p>
<p>'The same, sir captain,' the man assured him; and Messer
Lorenzo, looking, recognized one who had served under his own
banner some months since.</p>
<p>He shrugged indifferently at the captain's very evident
satisfaction.</p>
<p>'What odds?' he said. 'One name will serve as well as another to
die under.'</p>
<p>'And how,' quoth the captain, 'would you prefer to die? You
shall have your choice.'</p>
<p>'Of old age, I think,' said Messer Lorenzo airily, and heard the
titter that responded to his sally. But Tolentino scowled,
displeased.</p>
<p>'I mean, sir, will you be hanged, or will you leap from the
ledge to which you climbed last night?'</p>
<p>'Why, that now is a very different matter. You circumscribe the
choice. Appoint for me, I pray, the death that will afford you the
greater diversion.'</p>
<p>Tolentino considered him, stroking his long chin, his brows
wrinkled. He liked the fellow for his intrepid daring in the face
of death. But&mdash;he was Castellan of San Leo, and knew his
duty.</p>
<p>'Why,' said he slowly at length, 'we know that you can climb
like an ape; let us see if you can fly like a bird. Take him up to
the ramparts yonder.'</p>
<p>'Ah, but stay!' cried Messer Castrocaro, with suddenly startled
thoughts of those sins of his youth and with a certain corollary
hope. 'Are you all pagans in San Leo? Is a Christian to be thrust
across the black edge of death unshriven? Am I to have no priest,
then?'</p>
<p>Tolentino frowned, as if impatient of this fresh motive for
delay; then he signed shortly to Bernardo.</p>
<p>'Go fetch the priest,' said he; and thus dashed that faint, sly
hope Messer Lorenzo had been harbouring that the place might
contain no priest, and that these men, being faithful children of
Mother Church, would never dare to slay unshriven a man who asked
for shrift.</p>
<p>Bernardo went. He gained the chapel door on the very
pronouncement of the 'Ite Missa est,' just as the morning Mass was
ended, and on the threshold, in his haste, he all but stumbled
against a lady in black who was coming forth attended by two women.
He drew aside and flattened himself against the wall, muttering
words of apology.</p>
<p>But the lady did not at once pass on.</p>
<p>'Why all this haste to chapel?' quoth she, accounting it
strangely unusual in one of Tolentino's men.</p>
<p>'Messer Father Girolamo is required,' said he. 'There is a man
about to die who must be shriven.'</p>
<p>'A man?' said she, with a show of tender solicitude, conceiving
that one of the all too slender garrison had been wounded to the
death.</p>
<p>'Ay, a captain of Valentino's&mdash;one Lorenzo
Castrocaro&mdash;who came hither in the night. And,' he added
vaingloriously, 'it was I, Madonna, who took him.'</p>
<p>But the Lady Bianca de' Fioravanti never heard his last words.
She fell back a step, and rested, as if for support, against one of
the diminutive pillars of the porch. Her face had become deathly
white, her eyes stared dully at the soldier.</p>
<p>'What...What is his name, did you say?' she faltered.</p>
<p>'Lorenzo Castrocaro&mdash;a captain of Valentino's,' he
repeated.</p>
<p>'Lorenzo Castrocaro?' she said in her turn, but on her lips the
name seemed another, so differently did she utter it.</p>
<p>'Ay, Madonna,' he replied.</p>
<p>Suddenly she gripped his arm, so that she hurt him.</p>
<p>'And he is wounded&mdash;to the death?' she cried with a sudden
fierceness, as it seemed to him.</p>
<p>'Nay; not wounded. He is to die, having been captured. That is
all. Messer Tolentino will have him jump from the rock. You will
have a good view from the battlements, Madonna. It is&mdash;'</p>
<p>She released his arm, and fell back from him in horror, cutting
short his praise of the entertainment provided.</p>
<p>'Take me to your captain,' she commanded.</p>
<p>He stared at her, bewildered. 'And the priest?' he inquired.</p>
<p>'Let that wait. Take me to your captain.'</p>
<p>The command was so imperious that he dared not disobey her. He
bowed, muttering in his beard, and, turning, went up the passage
again, and so out into the courtyard, the lady and her women
following.</p>
<p>Across the intervening space Madonna Bianca's eyes met the proud
glance of Messer Lorenzo's, and saw the sudden abatement of that
pride, saw the faint flush that stirred at sight of her in those
pale cheeks. For to the young man this was a startling apparition,
seeing that&mdash;as Cesare Borgia had been careful to
provide&mdash;he had no knowledge or even suspicion of her presence
in San Leo.</p>
<p>A moment she paused, looked at him, her soul in her eyes; then
she swept forward, past Bernardo, her women ever following her.
Thus came she, very pale but very resolute of mien, to the captain
of her fortress.</p>
<p>Messer Tolentino bowed profoundly, uncovering, and at once
explained the situation.</p>
<p>'Here is a young adventurer, Madonna, whom we captured last
night within these walls,' said he. 'He is a captain in the service
of Cesare Borgia.'</p>
<p>She looked at the prisoner again standing rigid before her, and
from the prisoner to her officer.</p>
<p>'How came he here?' she asked, her voice curiously strained.</p>
<p>'He climbed the rock on the southern side at the risk of his
neck,' said Tolentino.</p>
<p>'And what sought he?'</p>
<p>''Tis what we cannot precisely ascertain,' Tolentino admitted.
'Nor will he tell us. When captured last night he pretended to be
an envoy from Duke Guidobaldo, which plainly he was not. That was
but a subterfuge to escape the consequences of his rashness.'</p>
<p>And the captain explained, with a pardonable parade of his own
shrewdness, how he had at once perceived that had Messer Lorenzo
been what he pretended, there would have been no need for him to
have come to San Leo thus, in secret.</p>
<p>'Nor need to risk his neck, as you have said, by climbing the
southern side, had he been employed by Cesare Borgia,' said the
lady.</p>
<p>'That is too hasty a conclusion, Madonna,' Tolentino answered.
'It is only on the southern side that it is possible to climb the
wall; and along the summit itself there is no way round.'</p>
<p>'To what end, then, do you conceive that he came?'</p>
<p>'To what end? Why, to what end but to betray the castle into the
hands of the Borgia troops,' cried Tolentino, a little out of
patience at such a superfluity of questions.</p>
<p>'You have proof of that?' she asked him, a rising inflection in
her voice.</p>
<p>'To common sense no proof is needed of the obvious,' said he
sententiously, snorting a little as he spoke, out of his resentment
of this feminine interference in men's affairs. 'We are about to
fling him back the way he came,' he ended with a certain grim
finality.</p>
<p>But Madonna Bianca paid little heed to his manner.</p>
<p>'Not until I am satisfied that his intentions were as you say,'
she replied; and her tone was every whit as firm as his, and was
invested with a subtle reminder that she was the mistress paramount
of San Leo, and he no more than the castellan.</p>
<p>Tolentino glowered and shrugged.</p>
<p>'Oh, as you please, Madonna. Yet I would make bold to remind you
that my ripe experience teaches me best how to deal with such a
matter.'</p>
<p>The girl looked that war-worn veteran boldly in the eye.
'Knowledge, sir captain, is surely of more account than mere
experience.'</p>
<p>His jaw fell.</p>
<p>'You mean that you&mdash;that you have knowledge of why he
came?'</p>
<p>'It is possible,' said she, and turned from the astonished
captain to the still more astonished prisoner.</p>
<p>Daintily she stepped up to Messer Lorenzo, whose deep sapphire
eyes glowed now as they regarded her, reflecting some of the
amazement in which he had listened to her words. He had weighed
them, seeking to resolve the riddle they contained, and&mdash;be it
confessed at once&mdash;wondering how he might turn the matter to
his profit in this present desperate pass.</p>
<p>I fear you may discover here something of the villain in Messer
Lorenzo. And I admit that he showed himself but little a hero of
romance in that his first thought now was how he might turn to
account the lady's interest in him. But if it was not exactly
heroic, it was undeniably human, and if I have conveyed to you any
notion that Messer Castrocaro was anything more than quite
ordinarily human, then my task has been ill-performed indeed.</p>
<p>It was not so much his love of her as his love of himself,
youth's natural love of life, that now showed him how he might
induce her to open a door for his escape from the peril that
encompassed him. And yet, lest you should come to think more ill of
him than he deserves, you are to remember that he had raised his
eyes to her long since, although accounting her far beyond his
adventurer's reach.</p>
<p>She looked at him in silence for a moment. Then, with a calm too
complete to be other than assumed she spoke.</p>
<p>'Will you give me your arm to the battlements, Messer
Lorenzo?'</p>
<p>A scarlet flush leapt to his cheeks; he stepped forward briskly
to her side. Tolentino would still have interposed.</p>
<p>'Consider, Madonna,' he began.</p>
<p>But she waved him peremptorily aside; and, after all, she was
the mistress in San Leo.</p>
<p>Side by side the prisoner and the lady paramount moved away
towards the staircase that led up to the embattled parapet.
Tolentino growled his impatience, cursed himself for being a
woman's lackey, dismissed his men in a rage, and sat down by the
well in the centre of the courtyard to await the end of that
precious interview.</p>
<p>Leaning on the embattled wall, looking out over the vast, sunlit
Emilian Plain, Madonna Bianca broke at last the long spell of
silence that had endured between herself and Castrocaro.</p>
<p>'I have brought you here, Ser Lorenzo,' she said, 'that you may
tell me the true object of your visit to San Leo.' Her eyes were
averted from his face, her bosom heaved gently, her voice quivered
never so slightly.</p>
<p>He cleared his throat, to answer her. His resolve was now clear
and definite.</p>
<p>'I can tell you what I did not come to do, Madonna,' he
answered, and his accents were almost harsh. 'I did not come to
betray you into the hands of your enemies. Of that I here make oath
as I hope for the salvation of my soul.'</p>
<p>It may seem perjury at the first glance; yet it was strictly
true, if not the whole truth. As we have seen, he had not dreamt
that she was in San Leo, or that in delivering up the castle to
Della Volpe's men he would be delivering up Madonna Bianca. Had he
known of her presence, he would not, it is certain, have accepted
the task. Therefore was he able to swear as he had done, and to
swear truly, though he suppressed some truth.</p>
<p>'That much I think I knew,' she answered gently.</p>
<p>The words and the tone if they surprised him emboldened him in
his deceit, urged him along the path to which already he had set
his foot. At no other time&mdash;considering what he was, and what
she&mdash;would he have dared so much. But his was now the courage
of the desperate. He stood to die, and nothing in life daunts him
who is face to face with death. He threw boldly that he might at
the eleventh hour win back the right to live.</p>
<p>'Ah, ask me not why I came,' he implored her hoarsely. 'I have
dared much, thinking that I dared all. But now&mdash;here before
you, under the glance of your angel eyes&mdash;my courage fails me.
I am become a coward who was not afraid when they brought me out to
die.'</p>
<p>She shivered at his words. This he perceived, and inwardly the
villain smiled.</p>
<p>'Look. Madonna.' He held out his hands, bruised, swollen, and
gashed. 'I am something in this state from head to foot.' He
turned. 'Look yonder.' And he pointed down the sheer face of the
cliff. 'That way I came last night&mdash;in the dark, risking death
at every step. You see that ledge, where there is scarce room to
stand. Along that ledge I crept, to yonder wider space, and thence
I leapt across that little gulf.' She shuddered as she followed his
tale. 'By that crevice I came upwards, tearing knees and elbows,
and so until I had gained the platform on the southern side,
there.'</p>
<p>'How brave!' she cried.</p>
<p>'How mad!' said he. 'I show you this that you may know what
courage then was mine, what indomitable impulse drove me hither.
You would not think, Madonna, that having braved so much, I should
falter now, and yet&mdash;' He stopped, and covered his face with
his hands.</p>
<p>She drew nearer, sidling towards him. 'And yet?' said she softly
and encouragingly.</p>
<p>'Oh! I dare not!' he cried out. 'I was mad&mdash;mad!' And then
by chance his tongue stumbled upon the very words to suit his case.
'Indeed, I do not know what was the spirit of madness that
possessed me.'</p>
<p>He did not know! She trembled from head to foot at that
admission. He did not know! But she knew. She knew, and hence the
confidence with which she had interposed to brush Tolentino aside.
For had he died, had the executioner driven him over that ledge in
that horrible death-leap, it would have been her hands that had
destroyed him.</p>
<p>For was it not she who had bewitched him? Was it not she who had
drugged him with a love philtre&mdash;the elixirium aureum procured
from Messer Corvinus Trismegistus? Did she not know that it was
that elixir, burning fiercely and unappeasably in his veins, that
had possessed him like a madness and brought him thither, reckless
of all danger, so that he might come to her?</p>
<p>The mage had said that he would become her utter slave ere the
moon had waned again. What had been the wizard's precise words? She
strove to recall them, and succeeded: 'He will come to you though
the whole world lie between you and him.'</p>
<p>Again the confident promise rang in her ears, and here, surely,
was its fulfilment. Behold how truly had the mage spoken&mdash;how
well his golden elixir had done its work.</p>
<p>Thus reasoned Madonna Bianca, clearly and confidently. There
were tears in her dark eyes as she turned them now upon the bowed
head of the young captain at her side; the corners of her gentle
mouth drooped wistfully. She put forth a hot hand, and laid it
gently upon his fair head, which seemed all turned to gold in the
fierce sunlight.</p>
<p>'Poor&mdash;poor Lorenzo!' she murmured fondly.</p>
<p>He started round and stared at her, very white.</p>
<p>'Oh, Madonna!' he cried, and sank upon one knee before her. 'You
have surprised my secret&mdash;my unutterable secret! Ah, let me
go! Let them hurl me from the rock, and so end my
wretchedness!'</p>
<p>It was supremely well done, the villain knew; and she were no
woman but a very harpy did she now permit his death. He was
prepared for a pitying gentleness towards an affliction which she
must now suppose her own beauty had inspired, and so he had looked
for a kindly dismissal. But he was not prepared for any such answer
as she made him.</p>
<p>'Dear love, what are you saying? Is there no other happiness for
you save that of death? Have I shown anger? Do I show aught but
gladness that for me you should have dared so much?'</p>
<p>To Messer Lorenzo it seemed in that moment that something was
amiss with the world, or else with his poor brain. Was it
conceivable that this noble lady should herself have turned the
eyes of favour upon him? Was it possible that she should return
this love of his, which he had deemed of such small account that in
his urgent need he had not scrupled to parade it for purposes of
deceit, where he would not have dared parade it otherwise?</p>
<p>He gave utterance to his overmastering amazement.</p>
<p>'Oh, it is impossible!' he cried; and this time there was no
acting in his cry.</p>
<p>'What is impossible?' quoth she; and, setting her hands under
his elbows, she raised him gently from his kneeling posture. 'What
is impossible?' she repeated when they stood face to face once
more.</p>
<p>And now the fire in his eyes was not simulated.</p>
<p>'It is impossible that you should not scorn my love,' said
he.</p>
<p>'Scorn it? I? I who have awakened it&mdash;I who have desired
it?'</p>
<p>'Desired it?' he echoed, almost in a whisper. 'Desired it?' For
a spell they stood so, staring each into the other's eyes; then
they fell into each other's arms, she sobbing in her extreme joy,
and he upon the verge of doing no less, for, as you will perceive,
it had been a very trying morning for him.</p>
<p>And it was thus&mdash;the Lady of San Leo and the Borgia captain
clasped heart to heart under the summer sky&mdash;that Messer
Tolentino found them.</p>
<p>Marvelling at the long delay, the castellan had thought it well
to go after them. And what he now beheld struck him to stone, left
him gaping like a foolish image.</p>
<p>They fell apart for very decency, and then the lady, rosily
confused, presented Messer Lorenzo to the castellan as her future
lord, and explained to him in confidence&mdash;and as she
understood it&mdash;the true reason of that gentleman's visit to
San Leo.</p>
<p>That Tolentino profoundly and scornfully discountenanced the
whole affair&mdash;that he accounted it unpardonable in his
mistress, a loyal subject of Duke Guidobaldo's, the holder, indeed,
of one of the fortresses of Urbino, to take to husband one whose
fortunes followed those of the Borgia usurper&mdash;there is no
doubt; for Messer Tolentino has left it upon record. And if he did
not there and then tell her so, with all that warmth of expression
for which he was justly renowned, it was because he was dumbfounded
by sheer amazement.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Messer Lorenzo was cared for as became a man in his
position. A bath was prepared for him; fresh garments were found to
fit him, the richest and most becoming being selected; the garrison
was disappointed of its execution, and the Borgia captain went to
dine at Madonna's table. For this banquet the choicest viands that
the besieged commanded were forthcoming, and the rarest wines from
Fioravanti's cellar were procured.</p>
<p>Messer Lorenzo was gay and sprightly, and in the afternoon,
basking in the sunshine of Madonna Bianca's smiles, he took up a
lute that he discovered in her bower, and sang for her one of the
atrocious songs that in her honour he had made. It was a dangerous
experiment. And the marvel of it is that, despite a pretty taste of
her own in lyric composition, Madonna Bianca seemed well
pleased.</p>
<p>In all Italy there was no happier man in that hour than Lorenzo
Castrocaro, who, from the very edge of death, saw himself suddenly
thrust up to the highest and best that he could have dared to ask
of life. His happiness entirely engrossed his mind awhile. All else
was forgotten. But suddenly, quite suddenly, remembrance flooded
back upon him and left him cold with horror. He had been midway
through his second song, Madonna languishing beside him, when the
thought struck him, and he checked abruptly. The lute fell
clattering from his grasp, which had suddenly grown nerveless.</p>
<p>With a startled cry his mistress leaned over him.</p>
<p>'Enzo! Are you ill?'</p>
<p>He rose precipitately.</p>
<p>'No, no; not ill. But&mdash;Oh!' He clenched his hands and
groaned. She too had risen, all sweet solicitude, demanding to know
what ailed him. He turned to her a face that was blank with
despair.</p>
<p>'What have I done? What have I done?' he cried, thereby
increasing her alarm.</p>
<p>It crossed her mind that perhaps the effect of the magician's
philtre was beginning to wane. Fearfully, urgently she insisted
upon knowing what might be alarming him; and he, seeing himself
forced to explain, paused but an instant to choose a middle course
in words, to find expressions that would not betray him.</p>
<p>'Why, it is this,' he cried, and there was real chagrin in his
voice as there was in his heart. 'In my hot madness to come hither,
I never paused to count the cost. I am a Borgia captain, and at
this moment no better than a traitor, a deserter who has abandoned
his trust and his condotta to go over to the enemy&mdash;to sit
here and take my ease in the very castle that my Duke is now
besieging.'</p>
<p>At once she perceived and apprehended the awful position that
was his.</p>
<p>'Gesù!' she cried. 'I had not thought of that.'</p>
<p>'When they take me, they will surely hang me for a traitor!' he
exclaimed; and indeed he feared it very genuinely, for what else
was he become? All night he had left Della Volpe and his men to
await in vain the unbarring of the gate. For having failed there
could be no excuse other than death or captivity. That he should
not only remain living, but that he should later be discovered to
have made alliance with Madonna Bianca de' Fioravanti was a matter
that could have no issue but one.</p>
<p>'By heaven, it had been a thousand times better had Tolentino
made an end of me this morning as he intended!' Then he checked
abruptly, and turned to her penitently. 'Ah, no, no! I meant not
that, Madonna! I spoke without reflecting. I were an ingrate to
desire that&mdash;an ingrate and a fool. For had they killed me I
had never known this day of happiness.' 'Yet what is to be done?'
she cried, crushing her hands together in her agony of mind. 'What
is to be done, my Enzo? To let you now depart would no longer save
you. Oh let me think, let me think!' And then, almost at once:
'There is a way!' she cried; and on that cry, which had been one of
gladness, she fell suddenly very gloomy and thoughtful. 'What way?'
quoth he.</p>
<p>'I fear it is the only way,' she said never so wistfully.</p>
<p>And then he guessed what was in her mind and repudiated the
suggestion.</p>
<p>'Ah! Not that,' he protested. 'That way we must not think of. I
could not let you&mdash;not even to save my life.'</p>
<p>But on the word she looked up at him and her dark eye kindled
anew with loving enthusiasm.</p>
<p>'To save your life&mdash;yes. That is cause enough to justify
me. For nothing less would I do it, Enzo; but to save you&mdash;you
whom I have brought into this pass&mdash;'</p>
<p>'What are you saying, sweet?' he cried.</p>
<p>'Why, that the fault is mine, and that I must pay the
penalty.'</p>
<p>'The fault?'</p>
<p>'Did I not bring you hither?'</p>
<p>He flushed, something ill at ease to see&mdash;as he
supposed&mdash;his lie recoiling now upon him.</p>
<p>'Listen!' she pursued. 'You shall do as I bid you. You shall go
as my envoy to Cesare Borgia, and you shall offer him the surrender
of San Leo in my name, stipulating only for the honours of war and
the safe-conduct of my garrison.'</p>
<p>'No, no!' he protested still, and honestly, his villainy grown
repugnant. 'Besides, how shall that serve me?'</p>
<p>'You shall say that you knew a way to win into San Leo and
accomplish this&mdash;which,' she added, smiling wistfully, 'is,
after all, the truth. The Duke will be too well content with the
result to quarrel with the means employed.'</p>
<p>He averted his face.</p>
<p>'Oh! But it is shameful!' he cried out, and meant not what she
supposed him to mean.</p>
<p>'In a few days&mdash;in a few weeks, at most&mdash;it will
become inevitable,' she reminded him. 'After all, what do I
sacrifice? A little pride, no more than that. And shall that weigh
against your life with me? Better surrender now, when I have
something to gain from surrender, than later, when I shall have all
to lose.'</p>
<p>He considered. Indeed, it was the only way. And, after all, he
was robbing her of nothing that she must not yield in time&mdash;of
nothing, after all, that it might not be his to restore her very
soon, in part at least. Considering this, and what the Duke had
promised him, he gave her the fruit of his considerations, yet
hating himself for the fresh deceit he practised.</p>
<p>'Be it so, my Bianca,' he said; 'but upon terms more generous
than you have named. You shall not quit your dwelling here. Let
your garrison depart, but you remain!'</p>
<p>'How is that possible?' she asked.</p>
<p>'It shall be,' he assured her confidently, the promised
governorship in his mind.</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>That evening, with letters appointing him her plenipotentiary,
he rode out of San Leo alone, and made his way down into the valley
by the bridlepath. At the foot of this he came upon Della Volpe's
pickets, who bore him off to their captain, refusing to believe his
statement that he was Lorenzo Castrocaro.</p>
<p>When Della Volpe beheld him, the warriors single eye expressed
at once suspicion and satisfaction.</p>
<p>'Where have you been?' he demanded harshly.</p>
<p>'In San Leo, yonder,' answered Castrocaro simply.</p>
<p>Della Volpe swore picturesquely.</p>
<p>'We had accounted you dead. My men have been searching for your
body all day at the foot of the rock.'</p>
<p>'I deplore your disappointment and their wasted labour,' said
Lorenzo, smiling; and Della Volpe swore again.</p>
<p>'How came you to fail, and, having failed, how come you out
alive?'</p>
<p>'I have not failed,' was the answer. 'I am riding to the Duke
with the garrison's terms of capitulation.'</p>
<p>Della Volpe very rudely refused to believe him, whereupon Messer
Lorenzo thrust under the condottiero's single eye Madonna Bianca's
letters. At that the veteran sneered unpleasantly.</p>
<p>'Ha! By the horns of Satan! I see! You ever had a way with the
women, Lorenzo. I see!'</p>
<p>'For a one-eyed man you see too much,' said Messer Lorenzo, and
turned away. 'We will speak of this again&mdash;when I am wed. Good
night!'</p>
<p>It was very late when he reached Urbino. But late as it
was&mdash;long after midnight&mdash;the Duke was not abed. Indeed,
Cesare Borgia never seemed to sleep. At any hour of the day or
night he was to be found by those whose business was of import.</p>
<p>His highness was working in the library with Agabito preparing
dispatches for Rome, when Messer Lorenzo was ushered into his
presence.</p>
<p>He looked up as the young captain entered.</p>
<p>'Well,' quoth he sharply. 'Do you bring me news of the capture
of San Leo?'</p>
<p>'Not exactly, highness,' replied the condottiero. 'But I bring
you a proposal of surrender, and the articles of capitulation. If
your highness will sign them, I shall take possession of San Leo in
your name tomorrow.'</p>
<p>The Duke's fine eyes scanned the confident young face very
searchingly. He smiled quietly.</p>
<p>'<i>You</i> will take possession?' he said.</p>
<p>'As the governor appointed by your highness,' Messer Lorenzo
blandly explained.</p>
<p>He laid his letters before the Duke, who scanned them with a
swift eye, then tossed them to Agabito that the latter might con
them more minutely.</p>
<p>'There is a provision that the Lady Bianca de' Fioravanti is to
remain in San Leo,' said the secretary, marvelling.</p>
<p>'Why that?' quoth Cesare of Messer Lorenzo. 'Why, indeed, any
conditions?'</p>
<p>'Matters have put on a curious complexion,' the condottiero
expounded. 'Things went not so smoothly with me as I had hoped. I
will spare your highness the details; but, in short, I was caught
within the castle walls, and&mdash;and I had to make the best terms
I could under such circumstances.'</p>
<p>'You do not, I trust, account them disadvantageous to yourself?'
said Cesare. 'It would distress me that it should be so. But I
cannot think it; for Madonna Bianca is accounted very
beautiful.'</p>
<p>Castrocaro crimsoned in his sudden and extreme confusion. For
once he was entirely out of countenance.</p>
<p>'You are informed of the circumstances, highness?' was all that
he could say.</p>
<p>Cesare's laugh was short and almost contemptuous.</p>
<p>'I am something of a seer,' he replied. 'I could have foretold
this end ere ever you set out. You have done well,' he added, 'and
the governorship is yours. See to it at once, Agabito. Ser Lorenzo
will be in haste to return to Madonna Bianca.'</p>
<p>A half-hour later, after the bewildered yet happy Castrocaro had
departed to ride north again, Cesare rose from his writing-table,
yawned, and smiled at the secretary, who had his confidence and
affection.</p>
<p>'And so, San Leo, that might have held out for a year, is won,'
he said, and softly rubbed his hands in satisfaction. 'This
Castrocaro thinks it is all his own achievement. The lady imagines
that it is all her own&mdash;by the aid of that charlatan
Trismegistus. Neither dreams that all has fallen out as I had
intended, and by my contriving.' He made philosophy for the benefit
of Messer Agabito: 'Who would achieve greatness must learn not only
to use men, but to use them in such a manner that they never
suspect they are being used. Had I not chanced to overhear what I
overheard that night at the house of Corvinus Trismegistus, and,
knowing what I knew, set the human pieces in this game in motion to
yield me this result, matters might have been different indeed, and
lives would have been lost ere San Leo threw up its gates. And I
have seen to it that the wizard's elixir of love should do
precisely as he promised for it. Madonna Bianca, at least, believes
in that impostor.'</p>
<p>'You had foreseen this, highness, when you sent Castrocaro on
that dangerous errand?' Agabito ventured to inquire.</p>
<p>'What else? Where should I have found me a man for whom the
matter was less dangerous? He did not know that Madonna Bianca was
there. I had the foresight to keep that matter secret. I sent him,
confident that, should he fail to open the gates to Della Volpe and
be taken, he was crafty enough not to betray himself, and Madonna
must, of course, assume that it was her love philtre had brought
him to her irresistibly. Could she have hanged him, knowing that?
Could she have done other than she has done?'</p>
<p>'Indeed, Corvinus has served you well.'</p>
<p>'So well that he shall have his life. The precious poison has
failed to kill him, and this is the sixteenth day.' The Duke
laughed shortly, and thrust his thumbs into the girdle of his robe,
which was of cloth of gold, reversed with ermine. Give the order
for his release tomorrow, Agabito. But bid them keep me his tongue
and his right hand as remembrances. Thus he will never write or
speak another lie.'</p>
<p>San Leo capitulated on the morrow: Tolentino and his men rode
out with the honours of war, lance on thigh, the captain very surly
at the affair, which he contemptuously admitted passed his
understanding.</p>
<p>Into the fortress came then Messer Lorenzo Castrocaro at the
head of a troop of his own men, to lay his governorship at the feet
of Madonna Bianca.</p>
<p>They were married that very day in the chapel of the fortress,
and although it was some years before each made to the other the
confession of the deceit which each had practised, the surviving
evidence all shows&mdash;and to the moralists this may seem
deplorable&mdash;that they were none the less happy in the
meantime.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>THE PERUGIAN</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>The Secretary of State of the Signory of Florence urged his mule
across the bridge that spans the Misa, and drawing rein upon the
threshold of the town of Sinigaglia, stood there at gaze. On his
right to westward the sun was sinking to the distant hazy line of
the Apennines, casting across the heaven an incendiary glow to
blend with that of the flames that rose above the city.</p>
<p>The secretary hesitated. His nature was gentle and almost timid,
as becomes a student and a man of thought, being in his own case in
violent contrast to the ruthless directness of his theories.
Scanning the scene before him with the wide-set, observant eyes
that moved so deliberately in his astute, olive-tinted face, he
wondered uneasily how things might have fared with Cesare Borgia.
Uproar reached him, completing the tale of violence which was borne
to his senses already by the sight of the flames. The uneasy guards
at the gate who had watched him closely, mistrusting his
hesitation, hailed him at last, demanding to know his business. He
disclosed himself, whereupon they respectfully bade him to pass on
and enjoy an ambassador's immunity.</p>
<p>Thus bidden he conquered his hesitation, touched his mule with
the spur and pushed on through the slush and snow that had
accumulated about the gateway into the borgo, where he found a
comparative calm, past the market-place which was deserted, and on
towards the palace.</p>
<p>The clamour, he observed, came all from the eastern quarter of
the town, which he knew&mdash;for he was a surprisingly
well-informed gentleman, this Florentine&mdash;to be inhabited by
the Venetian traders and the prosperous Jews. Hence he argued
logically&mdash;for he was ever logical&mdash;that the main issue
was decided and that the uproar was that of looting soldiery; and
knowing as he did the rigour with which looting was forbidden to
the followers of the Duke of Valentinois, the only sane conclusion
seemed to him to be that notwithstanding all the guile and craft at
his command, the Duke had been worsted in the encounter with his
mutinous condottieri. And yet in his wisdom and in his knowledge of
men Messer Macchiavelli hesitated to accept such a conclusion,
however much the facts might seem to thrust it upon him. He guessed
something of Cesare Borgia's design in coming to Sinigaglia to make
peace with the rebels and settle terms for the future. He knew that
the Duke had been prepared for treachery that he had done no more
than pretend to walk into a trap, having taken care first to make
himself master of its springs. That in spite of this those springs
should have snapped upon him, the secretary could not believe. And
yet undoubtedly pillage was toward, and pillage was forbidden by
the Duke.</p>
<p>Marvelling, then, Messer Macchiavelli rode on up the steep
street towards the palace. Soon his progress was arrested. The
narrow way was thronged and solid with humanity; a great mob surged
before the palace. Upon one of its balconies in the distance he
could faintly discern the figure of a man, and since this man was
gesticulating, the secretary concluded that he was haranguing the
multitude.</p>
<p>Messer Macchiavelli leaned from the saddle to question a rustic
on the outskirts of the mob.</p>
<p>'What is happening?' quoth he.</p>
<p>'The devil knows,' answered the man addressed. 'His Potency the
Duke with Messer Vitellozzo and some others went into the palace
two hours since. Then comes one of his captains&mdash;they say it
was Messer da Corella&mdash;with soldiery, and they went down into
the borgo where they say they have fallen upon the troops of the
Lord of Fermo, and the Lord of Fermo is in the palace too, and it
is New Year's Day tomorrow. By the Madonna, an ugly beginning to
the new year this, whatever may be happening! They are burning and
looting and fighting down there, until they have made the borgo
into the likeness of hell, and in the palace the devil knows what
may be happening. Gesù Maria! These be dread times, sir. They do
say...'</p>
<p>Abruptly he checked his loquaciousness under the discomposingly
fixed gaze of those sombre, observant eyes. He examined his
questioner more closely, noted his sable, clerkly garments heavily
trimmed with fur, mistrusted instinctively that crafty, shaven face
with its prominent cheekbones, and bethought him that he were
perhaps wiser not to make himself further the mouthpiece of popular
rumour.</p>
<p>'But then,' he ended abruptly, therefore, 'they say so much that
I know not what they say.'</p>
<p>The thin lines of Macchiavelli's lips lengthened slightly in a
smile, as he penetrated the reasons of the man's sudden reticence.
He pressed for no further information, for indeed he needed no more
than already he had received. If the duke's men under Corella had
fallen upon Oliverotto da Fermo's troops, then his expectations had
been realized, and Cesare Borgia, meeting treachery with treachery,
had stricken down the mutinous condottieri.</p>
<p>A sudden surge of the crowd drove the Florentine orator and the
rustic apart. A roar rose from the throat of the multitude.</p>
<p>'Duca! Duca!'</p>
<p>Standing in his stirrups, Macchiavelli beheld in the distance
before the palace a glitter of arms and the fluttering of bannerols
bearing the bull device of the House of Borgia. The lances formed
into a double file, and this clove a way through that human press,
coming rapidly down the street towards the spot where the
secretary's progress had been arrested.</p>
<p>The crowd was flung violently back like water before the prow of
a swift-sailing ship. Men stumbled against one another, each in
turn cursing the one who thrust against him, and in a moment all
was fierce clamour and seething anger; yet above it all rang the
acclaiming shout:</p>
<p>'Duca! Duca!'</p>
<p>On came the glittering riders, jingling and clanking, and at
their head on a powerful black charger rode a splendid figure, all
steel from head to foot. His visor was open, and the pale young
face within was set and stern. The beautiful hazel eyes looked
neither to right nor left, taking no heed of the acclamations
thundering all about him. Yet those eyes saw everything whilst
seeming to see nothing. They saw the Florentine orator, and seeing
him, they kindled suddenly.</p>
<p>Macchiavelli swept off his bonnet, and bowed to the very withers
of his mule to salute the conqueror. The pale young face smiled
almost with a certain conscious pride, for the Duke was well
pleased to have as it were the very eyes of Florence upon him in
such a moment. He drew rein on a level with the envoy.</p>
<p>'Olà, Ser Niccolò!' he called.</p>
<p>The lances cleared a path speedily, flinging the crowd still
farther back, and Messer Macchiavelli walked his mule forward in
answer to that summons.</p>
<p>'It is done,' the Duke announced. 'I have fulfilled no less than
I promised. What it was I promised you will now understand. I made
my opportunity, and having made it I employed it&mdash;so well that
I hold them fast, Vitelli, Oliverotto, Gravina and Giangiordano's
bastard. The other Orsini, Gianpaolo Baglioni and Petrucci will
follow. My net is wide flung, and to the last man they shall pay
the price of treachery.'</p>
<p>He paused, waiting for words that should tell him not what
opinion might be Messer Macchiavelli's own, but what reception such
news was likely to receive in Florence. The secretary, however, had
all the caution of the astute. He was not addicted to any
unnecessary expressions of opinion. His face remained inscrutable.
He bowed in silence, as one who accepts a statement without
consciousness of the right to comment.</p>
<p>A frown flickered between the splendid eyes that were
considering him.</p>
<p>'I have done a very great service to your masters, the Signory
of Florence,' he said, almost in a tone of challenge.</p>
<p>'The Signory shall be informed, Magnificent,' was the orator's
evasive answer, 'and I shall await the honour of conveying to your
potency the Signory's felicitations.'</p>
<p>'Much has been done,' the Duke resumed. 'But much is yet to do,
and who shall tell me what?' He looked at Macchiavelli, and his
eyes invited counsel.</p>
<p>'Does your potency ask me?'</p>
<p>'Indeed,' said the Duke.</p>
<p>'For theory?'</p>
<p>The Duke stared; then laughed. 'For theory,' he said. 'The
practice you can leave to me.'</p>
<p>Macchiavelli's eyes narrowed. 'When I speak of theory,' he
explained, 'I mean an opinion personal to myself&mdash;not a
pronouncement of the Florentine Secretary.' He leaned a little
nearer. 'When a prince has enemies,' he said quietly, 'he must deal
with them in one of two ways; he must either convert them into
friends or put it beyond their power to continue his enemies.'</p>
<p>The Duke smiled slowly. 'Where learnt you that?' he asked.</p>
<p>'I have watched with admiration your potency's rise to
greatness,' said the Florentine.</p>
<p>'And you have melted down my actions into maxims to govern my
future?'</p>
<p>'More, Magnificent, to govern all future princes.'</p>
<p>The Duke looked squarely into that sallow, astute face with its
sombre eyes and prominent cheekbones.</p>
<p>'I sometimes wonder which you are&mdash;courtier or
philosopher,' he said. 'But your advice is timely&mdash;either make
them my friends or put it beyond their power to continue my
enemies. I could not again trust them as my friends. You will see
that. Therefore...' He broke off. 'But we will talk of this again,
when I return. Corella's troops have got out of hand; they are
burning and looting in the borgo, and I go to set a term to it, or
else peddling Venice will be in arms to recover the ducats
plundered from her shopkeepers. You will find entertainment in the
palace. Await me there.'</p>
<p>He made a sign to his lances, wheeled, and rode on briskly about
his task, while Macchiavelli in his turn went off in the opposite
direction, through the lane opened out for him very readily in the
crowd, since all had seen that he was one who enjoyed the exalted
honour of the Duke's acquaintance. The Florentine made his way to
the palace as he had been bidden, and thence he indited his famous
letter to the Signory of Florence, in which he announced these
happenings to his masters. He informed them of the manner adopted
by Cesare Borgia to turn the tables upon those who had not kept
faith with him, he told them how his master-stroke had resulted in
the seizure of the three Orsini, of Vitellozzo Vitelli, and
Oliverotto, lord of Fermo, and he concluded with the opinion: 'I
greatly doubt if any of them will be alive by morning.'</p>
<p>Anon he was to realize that for all his penetration he had
failed to plumb to its full depth the craft and guile of Cesare
Borgia. So astute an observer should have perceived that to have
wrung the necks of the Orsini out of hand would have been to spread
consternation and alarm in the lair of the bear in Rome, and that
being alarmed the powerful Cardinal Orsini, his brother Giulio and
his nephew Matteo (with whom we are more particularly concerned)
might seek safety in flight, and in that safety concert
reprisals.</p>
<p>Macchiavelli's failure to foresee the course which such
considerations must dictate to Cesare is another proof of how much
the Duke was the Florentine's master in statecraft.</p>
<p>The lords of Fermo and Castello were dealt with as Macchiavelli
expected. They were formally judged, found guilty of treason
against their overlord, and strangled that same night&mdash;back to
back, with the same rope, it is said&mdash;in the Palace of the
Prefecture of Sinigaglia, whereafter their bodies were
ceremoniously borne to the Misericordia Hospital. But the Orsini
did not share just yet the fate of their fellow-traitors. They were
accorded another ten days of life, until, that is, Cesare had
received advices from Rome that the Cardinal Orsini and the rest of
the Orsini brood were safely captured. Thereupon at
Assisi&mdash;whither the Duke had removed himself by then, Gravina
and Paolo Orsini were delivered over to the strangler.</p>
<p>The Duke's net had been wide flung, as he told Macchiavelli on
that evening in Sinigaglia. Yet four there were who had escaped its
meshes: Gianpaolo Baglioni, prevented from waiting upon the Duke in
Sinigaglia by an illness which had proved less fatal to him than
had their health to his associates; Pandolfo Petrucci, Tyrant of
Siena&mdash;the only one of them all who seems to have had the wit
to mistrust the Duke's intentions&mdash;who armed at all points had
taken refuge behind the ramparts of his city, there to wait upon
events; Fabio Orsini, who had gone after Petrucci; and Matteo
Orsini, the latter's cousin and the cardinal's nephew, who had
vanished no man knew whither.</p>
<p>The Duke set himself the task of hunting down the first three,
whose whereabouts were known to him. Matteo mattered less, and
could be left until later.</p>
<p>'But I swear to God,' Cesare informed Fra Serafino, the minorite
friar who discharged the functions of secretary in the absence of
the moonfaced Agabito. 'I swear to God, that there is no hole in
Italy into which I shall not pursue him.'</p>
<p>This was at Assisi on the very day that he ordered the
strangling of Gravina and Giangiordano's bastard. On that same
evening came one of his spies with information that Matteo Orsini
was in hiding at Pievano, the castle of his distant kinsman
Almerico&mdash;an Orsini this last, too aged and too inactive to be
worthy the Duke's attention, a studious man, living almost in
seclusion with his books and his daughter, untouched by ambition,
asking but to be left in peace, undisturbed by all the strife and
bloodshed that were afflicting Italy.</p>
<p>The Duke was housed in the Rocca Maggiore, that grey embattled
fortress crowning the steep hill above the city, and from the
height of its scarred and rugged slopes dominating the Umbrian
plain. He received the messenger in a vast stone-flagged chamber
that was very bare and chill. A great fire roared in the cavernous
fireplace, shedding an orange glow upon the empty spaces and
driving the shadows before it to seek refuge in the groins of the
ceiling overhead. Yet the Duke, pacing thoughtfully back and forth
whilst the messenger related what he had discovered, was tightly
wrapped for greater warmth in a scarlet mantle lined with lynx fur.
Fra Serafino occupied an oaken writing pulpit near one of the
windows, and sat cutting a quill, apparently lost in his task, yet
missing no word of what was being said.</p>
<p>The messenger was intelligent, and he had been diligent. Not
content with learning that Matteo Orsini was believed to be at
Pievano, he had scoured the borgo for scraps of gossip,
anticipating out of his own knowledge the very question which the
Duke now asked him&mdash;though not directly&mdash;and seeing to it
that he came equipped with a ready answer.</p>
<p>'This, then, is mere gossip,' Cesare sneered. '"It is said" that
Matteo Orsini is at Pievano. I am sick to death of "It is said",
and all his family. I have known him long, and never found him
other than a liar.'</p>
<p>'But the tale, may it please your potency, has its
probabilities,' said the messenger.</p>
<p>The Duke halted in his pacing. He stood before the flaming logs,
and put out a hand to its genial warmth&mdash;a hand so delicate
and slender that you would never have supposed its tapering fingers
to possess a strength that could snap a horseshoe. Standing thus,
the leaping firelight playing over his scarlet cloak, he seemed
himself a thing of fire. He threw back his tawny young head, and
his lovely eyes lost their dreamy thoughtfulness as they fastened
now upon the messenger.</p>
<p>'Probabilities?' said he. 'Discover them.' The messenger was
prepared to do so.</p>
<p>'The Count Almerico has a daughter,' he said promptly. 'It is
the common talk of Pievano that this lady&mdash;Madonna Fulvia she
is called&mdash;and Ser Matteo are to be married. The kinship
between them is none so close as to forbid it. The old count
approves, loving Ser Matteo as a son. And so, where else in Italy
should Ser Matteo be safer than with those who love him? Then, too,
Pievano is remote, its lord is a man of books, taking no part in
worldly turbulence; therefore Pievano, being of all places the last
in which one would think of looking for Ser Matteo is the likeliest
to which he would run for shelter. Thus circumstances confirm the
rumour of his presence there.'</p>
<p>The Duke considered the fellow in silence for a moment, weighing
what he said.</p>
<p>'You reason well,' he admitted at length, and the messenger
bowed himself double, overwhelmed by so much commendation. 'You
have leave to go. Bid them tell Messer da Corella to attend
me.'</p>
<p>The man bowed again, stepped softly to the door and vanished. As
the heavy curtain quivered to rest, Cesare sauntered across to one
of the windows and stared out upon the bleak landscape stretching
for miles before him in the cold light of that January afternoon.
Above the distant blue-grey mass of the Apennines the brooding sky
was slashed with gold. The River Chiagi winding its way to the
Tiber lay like a silver ribbon upon the dull green plain. Cesare
stared before him a while seeing nothing of all this. Then abruptly
he turned to Fra Serafino, who was now testing the quill he had
cut.</p>
<p>'What is to be done to take this fellow?' he asked.</p>
<p>It was his way to seek advice of all men, yet never following
any but such as jumped with his own wishes. And where no man's
advice consorted with his own notions, he acted upon his own
notions none the less.</p>
<p>The gaunt-faced monk looked up, almost startled by the
suddenness of the question. Knowing the Duke's way, and knowing
that Corella had been sent for, Fra Serafino put two and two
together, and presented the Duke with what he conceived to be the
total sum.</p>
<p>'Send ten lances to fetch him from Pievano,' he replied.</p>
<p>'Ten lances&mdash;fifty men...Hum! And if Pievano were to throw
up its bridges, and resist?'</p>
<p>'Send another twenty lances and a gun,' said Fra Serafino.</p>
<p>The Duke considered him, smiling faintly.</p>
<p>'You prove to me that you know nothing of Pievano, and still
less of men, Fra Serafino. I wonder do you know anything of
women?'</p>
<p>'God forbid!' ejaculated the monk, utterly scandalized.</p>
<p>'Then are you worthless as a counsellor in this,' was the Duke's
conclusion. 'I had hoped you could have imagined yourself a woman
for a moment.'</p>
<p>'Imagine myself a woman?' quoth Fra Serafino, his deep-set eyes
staring.</p>
<p>'That you might tell me what manner of man would be likeliest to
delude you. You see, Pievano is a rabbit warren. You might conceal
an army there, how much more easily a single man. And I do not
intend to alarm the Count Almerico into sending to earth a guest
whom we are not absolutely sure that he is harbouring. You see the
difficulty, I trust? To resolve it I shall need a man of little
heart and less conscience; a scoundrel who is swayed by nothing but
his own ambition, who cares for nothing but his own advancement;
and it is an inevitable condition that he should be of an exterior
that is pleasing to a woman and likely to command her confidence.
Now where shall I find me such a paragon?'</p>
<p>But Fra Serafino had no answer. He was lost in an amazed
consideration of the crooked underground ways by which Cesare
burrowed to his ends. And then Corella clanked in, booted, bearded,
stalwart and stiff, the very type of the condottiero.</p>
<p>The Duke turned, and considered him in silence at long length.
In the end he shook his head.</p>
<p>'No,' he said, 'you are not the man. You are too much the
soldier, too little the courtier, too much the swordsman, too
little the lute-player, and I think that you are almost ugly. If
you were a woman, Fra Serafino, should you not consider him an ugly
fellow?'</p>
<p>'I am not a woman, Magnificent...'</p>
<p>'That is all too evident,' the Duke deplored.</p>
<p>'And I do not know what I should think if I were a woman.
Probably I should not think at all, for I do not believe that women
think.'</p>
<p>'Misogynist,' said the Duke.</p>
<p>'God be thanked,' said Fra Serafino devoutly.</p>
<p>The Duke returned to the consideration of his captain.</p>
<p>'No,' he said again. 'The essence of success is to choose the
right tools for the work in hand; and you are not the tool for
this, Michele. I want a handsome, greedy, unscrupulous scoundrel,
who can both ply a sword and lisp a sonnet. Where shall I find one
answering that description. Ferrante da Isola would have been the
very man, but poor Ferrante died of one of his own jests.'</p>
<p>'What is the task, Magnificent?' ventured Corella.</p>
<p>'I'll tell that to the man I send to do it, when I have found
him. Is Ramirez here?' he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>'He is at Urbino, my lord,' Corella answered. 'But there is
Pantaleone degli Uberti, who seems in some way such a man as you
describe.'</p>
<p>The Duke considered. 'Send him hither,' he said shortly and
Corella bowed stiffly, and departed on that errand.</p>
<p>Cesare paced slowly back to the fire, and stood warming himself
until Pantaleone came&mdash;a tall, handsome fellow this, with
sleek black hair and bold black eyes, martial at once in bearing
and apparel yet with a certain foppishness not unbecoming to his
youth.</p>
<p>The interview was short. 'From information that I have
received,' said Cesare, 'I will wager a thousand ducats to a
horseshoe that Matteo Orsini is with his uncle at Pievano. I offer
that thousand ducats for his head. Go and earn it.'</p>
<p>Pantaleone was taken aback. He blinked his bold black eyes.
'What men shall I take?' he stammered.</p>
<p>'What men you please. But understand the thing is not to be done
by force. At the first show of it, Matteo, if he is there, will go
to earth like a mole, and not all your questing shall discover him.
This is an affair for wits, not lances. There is a woman at Pievano
who loves Matteo, or whom Matteo loves...But you will see for
yourself what opportunities there are, and you will use them.
Corella thinks you have the wit to accomplish such a task. Afford
me proof of it, and I will make your fortune.' He waved his hand in
dismissal, and Pantaleone stifled a hundred questions that were
bubbling in his mind, and departed.</p>
<p>Fra Serafino stroked his lean nose thoughtfully with his quill.
'I would not trust that fellow with a woman, nor a woman with that
fellow,' he delivered himself. 'He is too full in the lips.'</p>
<p>'That,' said Cesare, 'is why I chose him.'</p>
<p>'In a woman's hands he will be so much wax,' the monk
continued.</p>
<p>'I am stiffening him with a thousand ducats,' said the Duke.</p>
<p>But the friar's pessimism was nothing lessened. 'A woman's arts
can melt gold until it runs,' said he.</p>
<p>The Duke looked at him a moment. 'You know too much about women,
Fra Serafino,' he said, and under that rebuke the monkish secretary
shuddered and fell silent.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Pantaleone degli Uberti arrived at Pievano on the wings of a
snowstorm that swept across the Perugian foothills, and he arrived
alone. Within a couple of leagues of the little town he had parted
company with the ten knaves he had brought with him from Assisi. He
gave them orders to break up into groups of twos and threes and
thus follow him to Pievano, each group seeking different quarters
and pretending no acquaintance with the others. He concerted
signals by which at need he could rally them to himself, and
arranged that of the group of three who were to take up their
quarters at the Osteria del Toro one at least should remain
constantly at the inn where at any moment Pantaleone could find
him.</p>
<p>Messer Pantaleone, you see, was a man of method.</p>
<p>He bade them, further, dissemble their true estate, and, himself
adopting this course which he imposed upon his followers, he
staggered some hours later over the drawbridge into the courtyard
of the citadel on foot, a bedraggled, footsore man who seemed to be
upon the point of utter exhaustion. Admitted by a groom, he reeled
into the presence of the lord Almerico Orsini and gasped out as if
with his last breath an urgent prayer for sanctuary.</p>
<p>'I am a hunted man, my lord,' he lied. 'That bloody despot
Valentino clamours for this poor life of mine to swell his
hecatomb.'</p>
<p>The old lord of Pievano's white hands clawed the carved ebony
arms of his great chair. From under shaggy brows his piercing dark
eyes were bent upon this visitor. He knew well what was the
hecatomb to which Messer Pantaleone referred; no need for him to
ask; absorbed though he might be in his studies and removed in
mind, as in body, from all worldly turbulence, yet, being an
Orsini, it was not in human nature that he should remain ignorant
of and indifferent to the shedding of Orsini blood. And since here
was a man who, as it seemed, was come straight from the scene of
strife, he was to be welcomed as one bringing news on matters
closely touching the lord of Pievano.</p>
<p>Yet it was as characteristic of old Almerico Orsini as it was
anomalous in his day&mdash;when life was cheap and the misfortunes
of others troubled men but little&mdash;that his first thought
should be for this stranger's condition. Seeing him so piteously
bedraggled, so white and haggard, swaying like a drunkard where he
stood and breathing with obvious difficulty&mdash;in short, a man
who had reached the uttermost limits of endurance&mdash;the lord
Almerico made a swift sign to the groom who had admitted him. The
lackey thrust forward a rush-seated chair, and into this Messer
Pantaleone sank limply yet gratefully, dropping his sodden cap upon
the marbled floor and loosening his great red cloak so that his
soldier's leather harness was revealed.</p>
<p>He looked at the lord Almerico with a faint smile that seemed to
express his thanks, and then his bold eyes, seeming very weary now
under their heavy drooping lids, passed on to the lady who stood
beside her father's chair. She was a girl, no more, of a willowy,
virginal slenderness, very simply clad in a wine-coloured gown cut
square across her white young breast, and caught about her slender
waist by a silver girdle with a beryl clasp. Her blue-black hair
was held in a clump behind by a net of golden cord; her eyes, of a
blue so deep that they seemed almost black, considered him
piteously from out of her pale face.</p>
<p>Thus Messer Pantaleone first beheld her, and since his taste in
women was of the rude sort that craves for swelling amplitudes of
form, his questing glance passed on without reluctance to rake the
shadows of that noble chamber, looking for another who was not
present.</p>
<p>'Why are you come to me?' Almerico asked him with inscrutable
simplicity.</p>
<p>'Why?' Messer Pantaleone blinked as though the oddness of the
question afforded him surprise. 'Because you are an Orsini, and
because my cause is the cause of the Orsini.' He proceeded to
explain himself. 'Paolo Orsini was my friend.'</p>
<p>'<i>Was</i>?' The question came sharply from Madonna Fulvia.</p>
<p>Pantaleone fetched a deep sigh, and sank together like a man in
the uttermost depths of dejection. 'I see you have not heard. Yet I
should have thought that by now such evil news had travelled o'er
the face of all Italy. Paolo was strangled yesterday at Assisi, and
with him was strangled too the Duke of Gravina.'</p>
<p>The old man uttered a sharp cry. He half-rose from his seat,
supporting himself upon trembling arms; then, bereft of strength,
he sank back again.</p>
<p>'God's curse upon me who am the bearer of ill-tidings,' growled
the crafty Pantaleone savagely.</p>
<p>But the old man, recovering from his momentary collapse under
the shock of that news, reproved him for his words, whilst Madonna
Fulvia stood immobile and rigid in a grief that was after all
impersonal, for, although they were her kinsmen, she had known
neither of those whose death this fugitive announced.</p>
<p>'That is not yet all,' Pantaleone pursued, as if defending
himself against the Lord Almerico's reproof. 'From Rome comes news
that the Cardinal is in a dungeon of Sant' Angelo, that
Giangiordano is taken, together with Santacroce and I know not whom
besides. We know what mercy the Borgia will display. The Pope and
his bastard will never rest as long as in the House of Orsini one
stone remains upon another.'</p>
<p>'Then will he never rest indeed,' said Madonna Fulvia
proudly.</p>
<p>'I pray so, Madonna, devoutly do I pray it&mdash;I who was Paolo
Orsini's friend and who to my undying shame have served the Borgia
tyrant with him. For that&mdash;because Valentino knows that if I
served him it was but because I served Orsini and that I am to be
reckoned as of the Orsini's family&mdash;I am now proscribed and
hunted, and if I am taken I shall perish as Paolo and Gravina
perished and as men say that Matteo Orsini perished too.'</p>
<p>In nothing perhaps does the craft of the man appear so starkly
as in this probing statement. As he spoke these words he watched
father and daughter closely, seeming but to consider them with eyes
of concern and pity. He saw the sudden movement of astonishment
that neither could repress. Then came the girl's question, laden
with a sudden and betraying eagerness.</p>
<p>'Do men say that?' she cried, her eyes kindling and her bosom
quickening in her faint excitement.</p>
<p>'It is the common talk,' said that swindler sorrowfully. 'I pray
God and the saints it be untrue.'</p>
<p>'Indeed...' Almerico began gravely, as if to reassure him, and
then caution supervening, he abruptly checked. Unworldly and
guileless though he might be, yet some knowledge of his fellow-man
had come to him with his years, and this fugitive inspired him with
little trust, awakening in him an unusual caution. Obeying it, he
altered the tone and current of his phrase. 'I thank you, sir, for
that prayer.'</p>
<p>But Pantaleone accounted himself answered; concluded that Cesare
Borgia's suspicions were correct, and that Matteo Orsini was in
hiding here at Pievano or hereabouts. He reasoned syllogistically.
The woman who loved Matteo Orsini would not have received the news
of his death with such equanimity had she not been positively
assured that he was living. Such assurance in such times nothing
short of the man's presence at Peivano could afford. The very
eagerness with which she had received the rumour Pantaleone had
invented of Matteo Orsini's death showed how welcome would be a
tale that might diminish the hunt for that proscribed fugitive.</p>
<p>Wearing outwardly his mask of dejection, Messer Pantaleone's
treacherous heart rejoiced in this assurance that he was hot upon
the trail, and that soon Matteo Orsini and a thousand ducats would
be his.</p>
<p>But now he had to submit to questionings from his host.
Almerico's mistrust demanded to know more of him.</p>
<p>'You are from Assisi?' he inquired.</p>
<p>'From the lord Duke of Valentinois' camp there,' answered the
emissary.</p>
<p>'And you fled incontinently when they strangled Paolo and
Gravina?'</p>
<p>'Not so.' Messer Pantaleone saw the trap. In a game of wits he
was a match for any ten such recluse students as the lord of
Pievano. 'That, as I have said, was yesterday&mdash;before Cesare
Borgia had proof of my devotion to the Orsini. But for that same
devotion and the need to act upon it, I might have remained a
captain in the tyrant's service. But it happened that I knew of
Valentino's designs upon Petrucci at Siena. I attempted to send a
letter of warning to Petrucci. That letter was intercepted, and I
had but time to get to horse before the hangman's grooms should
come to fetch me. I rode that beast to death a league from here. My
notion was to get to Siena and Petrucci; but, being unhorsed and in
hourly danger of capture, I bethought me that I would turn aside
and seek sanctuary here. Yet, my lord,' he ended, rising with
elaborate show of physical pain and difficulty, 'if so be you think
that by my presence I shall draw down upon you Valentino's vengeful
justice, then...' He gathered his cloak about him, like a man about
to take his leave.</p>
<p>'A moment, sir&mdash;a moment,' said Almerico, hesitating; and
he put forth a hand to stay the soldier.</p>
<p>'What matters Valentino?' cried the girl, and quick anger blazed
in her eyes, transmuting them into fiery sapphires. 'Who fears him?
We were base indeed did we let you suffer for your generous
impulse, sir, to turn you hence who have been our kinsman's friend.
While there is a roof on Pievano you may sleep tranquilly under
it.'</p>
<p>Don Almerico shifted in his chair and grunted as she brought
that impulsive speech to its conclusion. His daughter went too
fast, he thought. Whilst himself he should have been reluctant to
have driven out this man who came in quest of sanctuary, yet
Madonna Fulvia outstripped him altogether in the matter of
hospitality.</p>
<p>He spread a white transparent hand to the blazing logs, and with
the other stroked his shaven chin cogitating. Then, looking
squarely at the stranger:</p>
<p>'What is your name, sir?' he asked him bluntly.</p>
<p>'I am called Pantaleone degli Uberti,' said the adventurer, who
had enough worldly wisdom never to make use of lies where truth
could be employed with safety.</p>
<p>'An honourable name,' the old man murmured, nodding as to
himself. 'Well, well! I will leave it, sir, to your discretion not
to tarry at Pievano longer than need be. I think not of myself.' He
shrugged and smiled deprecatingly, a smile of singular charm that
illumined as with a light of lingering youth within the venerable
old face. 'I am too old to weigh the paltry sum of life remaining
me against a service due to an honourable man. But there is this
child to consider, and the risk of your discovery here...'</p>
<p>But at that she interrupted him, breaking in with the
impulsiveness of her generous youth and womanly compassion.</p>
<p>'Who runs great risks may disregard such lesser ones,' she
cried, whereat Ser Pantaleone became all ears.</p>
<p>'By the Host! not so,' her father answered. 'We dare add nothing
at present to draw attention upon ourselves. You see...'</p>
<p>He checked under the suddenly tightened curb of reawakening
caution, and his eyes flashed keenly upon his visitor.</p>
<p>But Pantaleone's face was dull and wooden, a mask betraying
nothing of his inward satisfaction. For his quick wits had without
difficulty completed the lord of Pievano's broken sentence, and
found it confirming the assurance he had already formed of Matteo
Orsini's presence there.</p>
<p>Seeing himself scanned with mistrust, he chose that moment to
stagger where he stood. He reeled sideways, one hand to his brow,
the other groping feebly for support. Thus he crashed against a
bronze table that stood near him, sent it slithering a yard or so
along the marble tiles, and, missing its resistance, he fell
heavily beside it and lay at full stretch upon the floor.</p>
<p>'I am spent,' he groaned.</p>
<p>They sprang to him at once&mdash;all three: Almerico, his
daughter and the groom, who had remained in the background awaiting
his dismissal. And whilst her father went down on his old joints to
lend immediate aid, Madonna Fulvia issued orders briskly to the
gaping lackey.</p>
<p>'Fetch Mario, quickly,' she commanded. 'Bid them bring wine and
vinegar and napkins. Run!'</p>
<p>Pantaleone raised his lolling head and supported it against
Almerico's knee. He opened dull eyes, and babbled incoherent
excuses for thus discomposing them. This manifestation of concern
for them at such a moment touched them profoundly when coupled with
his condition: it melted the old Orsini's lingering mistrust as
snow upon the hills is melted by the April suns. The man's
extremity was dire and obvious&mdash;and what could have produced
it but the tribulations of which he told?</p>
<p>Came Mario&mdash;a short, sturdy fellow with a face that was the
colour of clay, and so ridged and pitted by smallpox that it seemed
no more than a hideous mask, a grotesque simulacrum of a human
countenance. He was nominally the castellan of Pievano; in effect
he was many things, a factotum including in his manifold
accomplishments the arts of chirurgeon, horse-leech, and barber. He
was rigidly honest, faithful, self-sufficient, and ignorant.</p>
<p>In his wake now as acolytes came a groom, Madonna Fulvia's own
woman, and Raffaele the page. Among them they bore flasks and
flagons, napkins and a silver basin. With the others they made a
group about Ser Pantaleone, whilst Mario went down on one knee
beside him and fumbled his pulse, his countenance grave and
oracular.</p>
<p>This pulse-feeling was a piece of impressive mummery, no more.
For whatever irregularity Mario had discovered there, his
prescription would have varied nothing. Finding no irregularity
whatever, it still varied nothing.</p>
<p>'Exhaustion. Ha!' he diagnosed. 'A little blood-letting will
revive him. I'll ease him of some six ounces, and all will be
well.' He rose. 'Vincenzo, lend a hand, and we'll carry him to bed.
You, Raffaele, light the way for us.'</p>
<p>So Mario and the groom lifted up our gentleman between them. The
page took up one of the gilt candlesticks that stood taller than
himself upon the floor, and went ahead. The rear was brought up by
Virginia, the waiting-maid, and thus in some sort of state was
Messer Pantaleone degli Uberti carried to bed and established at
Pievano.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Pantaleone awoke refreshed upon the morrow, none the worse for
the loss of the six ounces of blood upon which Mario's chirurgy had
insisted and to which he himself had been forced to submit that he
might play out his part.</p>
<p>He found his room suffused with the pale sunshine of a January
morning and fragrant with the subtle refreshing perfume of lemon
verbena steeped in potent vinegar; he found it occupied by the page
Raffaele, a graceful stripling with a lovely impudent face and
smooth hair that was the colour of buttercups.</p>
<p>'For lack of a man to serve you they have sent me,' the page
explained himself.</p>
<p>Pantaleone considered the supple figure in its suit of green
that fitted it like a skin.</p>
<p>'And what are you?' he wondered. 'A lizard?'</p>
<p>'I am glad to see you are mending,' said the boy. 'Impudence,
they tell me, is a sign of health.'</p>
<p>'And they tell it you often, I've no doubt, and find you healthy
in excess,' said Pantaleone, smiling grimly.</p>
<p>'Gesù!' said the boy, with uplifted eyes. 'I'll bear news of
your complete recovery to my lord.'</p>
<p>'Stay,' Pantaleone bade him, desiring to have a certain matter
explained. 'Since you were sent to serve, give me first to eat. I
may be an indifferent Christian, seeing that I have in a sense been
in the service of the Pope; but I find it difficult to fast in Lent
and impossible in any other season. There is a bowl yonder,
steaming. Let it be employed in the service for which it was
designed.'</p>
<p>Raffaele fetched the bowl which contained a measure of broth,
and with it a platter bearing a small wheaten loaf. He also fetched
a silver basin with water and a napkin. But these Pantaleone waved
impatiently away He had been reared in camps, not courts, and was
out of sympathy with the affectations of mincing fellows who carry
washing to excess.</p>
<p>He drank a portion of the soup noisily, broke bread and munched
it, considered the page gravely, and set out upon his quest of the
information which he conceived was to be gathered.</p>
<p>'For lack of men they sent you to me,' he said, pondering. 'How
come they to lack men at Pievano? The Lord Almerico is a great and
potent lord, such as should not want for lackeys. Whence, then,
this lack of men?'</p>
<p>The boy perched himself upon the bed. 'Whence are you, Messer
Pantaleone?' he inquired.</p>
<p>'I? I am from Perugia,' said the condottiero.</p>
<p>'And is it not known in Perugia that the Lord Almerico is above
all things a man of peace&mdash;of peace and books. He is more
concerned with Seneca than with any tyrant in Italy.'</p>
<p>'With whom?' asked Pantaleone.</p>
<p>'With Seneca,' the boy repeated.</p>
<p>'Who is he?' quoth Pantaleone, staring.</p>
<p>'A philosopher,' said Raffaele. 'My lord loves all
philosophers.'</p>
<p>'Then he will love me,' said Pantaleone, and drank the remainder
of his broth. 'But you haven't answered my question.'</p>
<p>'I have, indeed. I conveyed to you that my lord keeps here no
such family as might be expected in one of his estate. There are
but four grooms in his service.'</p>
<p>'Even so,' said Pantaleone. 'Out of four one might have been
spared me.'</p>
<p>'Ah, but then, Vincenzo who helped to carry you to bed is my
lord's own body servant; Giannone has his duties in the stables,
and Andrea has gone down to the borgo on an errand for
Madonna.'</p>
<p>'That makes but three, and you said there were four.'</p>
<p>'The fourth is Giuberti; but then Giuberti has vanished; he
disappeared a week ago.'</p>
<p>Pantaleone looked at the ceiling dreamily, reflecting how the
vanishing of this Giuberti chanced to coincide with the vanishing
of Matteo Orsini and wondering whether a link existed that would
connect the two.</p>
<p>'He was dismissed, you mean?' he grumbled.</p>
<p>'I do not think so. It is a mystery. There was a great ado that
morning here, and I have not seen Giuberti since. But he has not
been dismissed for I have been to his room and his garments are all
there. Nor did he leave Pievano, unless he went on foot, for there
is no horse missing from the stables. On the contrary&mdash;and
that is another mystery which none can solve for me&mdash;on the
morning after Giuberti's disappearance I found seven horses in the
stables instead of the usual six. I went there to count them that I
might discover whether Giuberti had gone away. As I set little
faith in wizardry I am not prepared to accept the simple
explanation that Giuberti has been changed into a horse. Had it
been an ass, now, I could have believed it&mdash;for no great
metamorphosis would have been needed. But there it is: we have lost
a biped and acquired a quadruped. An engaging mystery.'</p>
<p>Pantaleone's face showed nothing of the keenness with which he
listened to this fresh piece of indirect information of the
fugitive's presence at Pievano. He smiled lazily at the boy and
encouraged him with flattery to let the stream of his chatter flow
more freely.</p>
<p>'By the Host,' he approved him, 'although you may be no more
than a lad you have a man's wit; indeed, more wit than many a man
that I have known. You should go far.'</p>
<p>The boy curled his green legs under him upon the bed, and smiled
well gratified.</p>
<p>'You miss nothing,' Pantaleone spurred him on.</p>
<p>'Indeed, not much,' the boy agreed. 'And I could tell you more.
For instance, it happens that Mario's wife has also disappeared.
Mario is our castellan&mdash;he with the pock-marked face, who bore
you to bed last night and bled you. Mario's wife had charge of the
kitchen, and she vanished together with Giuberti. Now that is a
circumstance that intrigues me greatly.'</p>
<p>'It might intrigue you less if you were older,' said Pantaleone,
implying something which he did not himself believe, and implying
it solely as a goad.</p>
<p>Raffaele threw back his head, and considered the soldier with
some scorn.</p>
<p>'You said well when you said that I had more wit than many a
man,' he informed Pantaleone with pointed significance. 'A man, of
course, would blunder here to a prompt and lewd conclusion. Bah,
sir! I am a boy, not a cherub in a fresco. You have but to see
Colomba&mdash;Mario's wife&mdash;to be assured of the chastity of
her relations with Giuberti or with any man. You have seen Mario's
lovely countenance, looking as if the devil had stamped on it with
his hoofs and a red-hot horseshoe on each hoof. His wife's is even
more uncomely, for she took the smallpox from him when he had it,
which leaves them still the fit mates for each other that they were
originally.'</p>
<p>'Precocious ape,' said Pantaleone. 'Your discourse is a scandal
to a poor soldier's ears. I'd have the rods to you if you were boy
of mine.' He flung back the bedclothes so that the lad was
momentarily smothered in them, and rose to dress himself. He had
learnt all that Raffaele could tell him.</p>
<p>'It is the mystery of it all that intrigues me,' babbled the
page unabashed. 'Can you solve the riddle, Ser Pantaleone?'</p>
<p>'I'll try,' said Pantaleone struggling with his hose, but
Raffaele for all his precocity missed the grimness of that
answer.</p>
<p>Thus, then, you see our adventurer in possession of certain
facts that seemed to him tolerably clear: the disappearance of the
groom, Giuberti, and of the woman, Colomba, synchronizing with the
appearance of an additional horse in the stables and hence,
presumably, with the arrival at Pievano of Matteo Orsini, indicated
that the care of him had been entrusted to those two servants. Now
since had Matteo Orsini remained in the castle itself, so much
would have been unnecessary, it was further to be inferred
that&mdash;no doubt for greater secrecy&mdash;he had been lodged
elsewhere, though doubtlessly (and the presence of the horse
confirmed this) somewhere within the precincts of the citadel.</p>
<p>So far Ser Pantaleone was clear, and already he accounted the
half of his task accomplished. His next step must be to ascertain
what quarters outside the actual rocca the place contained.</p>
<p>He dressed himself with care in the garments which the page had
brought him from the kitchen, where they had been sedulously dried.
Having no shoes he must perforce resume his boots, and since the
weather was chill and he would presently be taking a turn out of
doors he buckled on his leather hacketon over his apricot-coloured
doublet. Finally, with his long sword hanging from his steel girdle
and a heavy dagger over his right hip, he made his way below, a
handsome cavalier, swaggering and arrogant of port, in whom it was
scarcely possible to recognize the fainting bedraggled fugitive
that but yesternight had implored sanctuary of the Lord of
Pievano.</p>
<p>The pert Raffaele ushered him into the presence of Messer
Almerico and Madonna Fulvia. They received him cordially,
expressing genuine pleasure at his evident recovery. All hesitation
and mistrust appeared to have vanished from the old man's
demeanour, whence Ser Pantaleone inferred that meanwhile the Lord
of Pievano had consulted with Matteo, and that Matteo had told
him&mdash;since in fact no man could have denied it&mdash;that his
story was very possibly true, and that he had been friendly with
Paolo Orsini as he said. Hence, superfluously now, the circumstance
of Matteo's presence was confirmed to him yet again.</p>
<p>Intent upon his task, he would have gone forth at once claiming
the need to take the air. But here the clay-faced Mario interposed
with all the pompous authority of a medical adviser.</p>
<p>'What, sir? Go forth&mdash;in your condition? It were a madness.
Last night you had the fever, and you were bled. You must rest and
recover, or I will not answer for your life.'</p>
<p>Pantaleone laughed&mdash;he had a deeply tuneful laugh that was
readily provoked, for when he was not laughing with you he would
laugh at you. He scorned the notion that he was weak or that the
frosty air would injure him. Was not the sun shining? Was he not
quite himself again?</p>
<p>But Mario's opposition was nothing shaken, rather did it gather
strength in argument.</p>
<p>'Since it is to my skill that you owe it that you feel
recovered, let my skill guide you when I say that the feeling is an
illusion, a lightness ensuing upon the relief of an excess of blood
which I have procured you. Forth you do not go save at your peril,
at the peril of undoing all the good I have done.'</p>
<p>And then to Mario's persuasions were added those of Orsini and
his daughter, until in the end, seeing that to insist further might
be to awaken suspicions dormant now, Ser Pantaleone, chafing
inwardly but still laughing outwardly, submitted. He spent the day
indoors, and found the time hang heavily, despite the kindly
efforts exerted by his host and his host's daughter to lighten it
for him.</p>
<p>The kindness which they lavished upon him, the fact that he sat
at table and broke bread with them, made no slightest impression
upon Ser Pantaleone. The hideous treachery of the thing he did, the
vileness of the manner in which he had insinuated himself into
their confidence, left him untouched. It was naught to him that he
should sit there in Pievano receiving the hospitality that is
bestowed upon a friend.</p>
<p>This Pantaleone was a man without sensibilities, an egotist with
a brutally practical mind which harboured no considerations but
those of worldly advancement. Honour to him was no more than one of
the infirmities of vain men. Shame was a sentiment unknown to him.
Macchiavelli might have honoured him for the fine singleness of
purpose by which he was ever guided towards the given end in
view.</p>
<p>On the morrow at last he had his way, despite Mario's lingering
doubts that it was unwise for him to go abroad. He would have taken
the page with him for company, thinking that the chatterbox might
be of service to him, but the excessive hospitality of Pievano
ordained otherwise. Since he would not be denied his desire to take
the air, Madonna Fulvia should be his guide. He protested that it
was to do him too much honour&mdash;as indeed it was. Nevertheless
she insisted, and together they went forth.</p>
<p>The gardens of Pievano ran in a flight of terraces up the steep
sides of the hill behind the castle, the whole of it enclosed by
massive, grey, machicolated walls that had stood two hundred years
and more, and resisted more than one siege in the past&mdash;though
that was before the days of such artillery as Cesare Borgia now
commanded. In summer these terraces were cool lemon groves and
cooler galleries of vine; but now all was bare, a mere network of
ramage to fret the January sunshine. Yet there were spaces of green
turf, whilst the mountain above them showed brightly emerald where
the snows had melted. Below them a little to the north was spread
the shining face of Lake Trasimene.</p>
<p>They came slowly to the topmost terrace&mdash;there were six of
them in all, whence a fine view was to be commanded of all that
broad valley. Here they found a sheltered spot under the western
wall, where a seat hewn out of granite was set before a deep tank
sunk to its rim into the ground&mdash;one of a series that were
used in summer for irrigation purposes. Above the seat in a little
semicircular niche there was a figure of the Virgin Mother in baked
earth, painted red and blue, that had become mottled by alternate
rain and sunshine.</p>
<p>Ser Pantaleone slipped his great red cloak from his shoulders,
and spread it on the seat for his companion. She demurred awhile.
Was he wise to sit, was not the air too chill and was he not
perhaps heated from his walk? Thus, shaping her tender solicitude
in questions she warned him. But he reassured her with a buoyant
laugh that made a mock of any assumption of weakness in his own
condition.</p>
<p>So side by side they sat on that hewn granite seat, beneath the
image of the Virgin Mother above the granite tank where the water
slept, a crystal mirror. So might a pair of lovers have sat; but if
she had no thoughts of love for her companion&mdash;her devotion
being all given to another, as we know&mdash;he had still less for
her. It was not that he was usually sluggish to dalliance. Those
full red lips of his told a different story, as Fra Serafino had
observed. But, in the first place, his taste was all for
generously-hipped deep-bosomed Hebes, and in the second his
thoughts were all concerned with the enucleation of this problem of
Matteo Orsini's hiding-place.</p>
<p>They commanded from that height a noble view of hills and
valley, of lake and river, as we have seen. But with this again Ser
Pantaleone was no whit concerned. His bold, black eyes were
questing nearer home, raking the disposition of the outbuildings to
the left of the rocca, and an odd pavilion on the other side
occupying the middle of a quadrangular terrain that was all walled
about so as to form, as it were, a <i>hortus inclusus</i>.</p>
<p>He stretched his long, lithe legs, and took a deep breath of the
clean mountain air, noisily like a draught that is relished. Then
he sighed.</p>
<p>'Heigh-o! If it were mine to choose my estate in life, I would
be lord of some such lordship as this of Pievano.'</p>
<p>'The ambition is a modest one,' said she.</p>
<p>'To have more is to have the power to work mischief, and who
works mischief raises up enemies, and who raises up enemies goes in
anxiety and may not know the pure joys of a contented life.'</p>
<p>'My father would agree with you. Such is his own philosophy.
That is why he has lived ever here, nor ever troubled himself to
strive for more.'</p>
<p>'He chose the better part, indeed,' Ser Pantaleone agreed. 'He
has enough, and who has enough is happy.'</p>
<p>'Ah, but whoever thinks that he has enough?'</p>
<p>'Your father thought so, and so should I think were I lord of
Pievano. To one in your station bearing your name it may seem no
more than mediocrity. Compared with what might be yours mediocrity
it is. Therein lies the secret of your happiness.'</p>
<p>'You make sure that I am happy,' said she.</p>
<p>He looked at her, and for a moment was in peril of straying into
by-ways concerned with her own affairs. But he conquered this.</p>
<p>'I were blind not to see it,' he said in a tone of finality.
'Though when I said "you" I meant not only yourself but your father
also. And here lies cause enough. A noble lordship, commodious yet
compact, the villeins in the borgo yonder paying tribute and
fealty, the rocca itself with all accessory buildings close-packed
under its mothering wing&mdash;saving perhaps that pavilion yonder
in the enclosed garden,' he excepted, waving his hand and speaking
idly, giving no sign that thus at last, having reached it by slow
and careful degrees, he came upon the goal which had been his since
first he took his seat beside her. 'That now,' he continued,
musing, 'is an odd construction. I cannot think for what purpose it
can have been built.'</p>
<p>There was a question plainly in the statement, and at once she
answered it.</p>
<p>'It is a lazar-house,' she said.</p>
<p>Startled, Ser Pantaleone shifted uneasily, and there was no
boldness now in the black eyes that stared at her. There was a
sinister ring in the word that brought horrors leaping before the
eyes of a man's imagination.</p>
<p>'A lazar-house?' he said, aghast.</p>
<p>She explained: 'It happened in the days when my father was no
more than a boy. There was the plague in Florence, and it was
carried thither to the borgo. Men were dying like flies at close of
autumn. To succour them my grandfather ordered that pavilion to be
built with others that have since been demolished, and he had the
place enclosed by walls. There was a saintly minorite, one Fra
Cristofero, who came to tend the plague-ridden, and who himself was
miraculously preserved from the contagion.'</p>
<p>Ser Pantaleone twisted his features in a grimace of disgust.
'And do you keep that as a monument in honour of so ugly an event?'
he asked.</p>
<p>'Why, no. There were other buildings there; but, as I have told
you, they were demolished. That was the only one retained.'</p>
<p>'But why?' he asked.</p>
<p>'It has its uses.'</p>
<p>He looked at her with raised eyebrows, expressing a faint
incredulity.</p>
<p>'You will not tell me that it is tenanted?' he asked in a note
that was faintly jesting.</p>
<p>'No, no.'</p>
<p>She spoke too quickly, he noted; and her voice had trembled,
whilst those deep loyal eyes of hers had fallen guiltily away from
his regard.</p>
<p>'No, no,' she repeated. 'Of course, it is not tenanted now.' He
looked idly away towards the spot. She had lied to him, he was
convinced already. Yet he would make assurance doubly sure.
Suddenly he drew his legs under him and started half-rising with a
sudden exclamation, his face averted from her and turned towards
the enclosed garden.</p>
<p>And then he felt her hand upon his sleeve.</p>
<p>'What is it?' she asked, and her voice was breathless.</p>
<p>'Surely...Surely, you are wrong,' he said. 'It is tenanted. It
seemed to me that I saw something or someone move there in the
shadow.'</p>
<p>'Oh, no, no&mdash;impossible! You were mistaken! There is no one
there!' Agitation quivered in every syllable of that breathless
denial.</p>
<p>He had drawn from her the answer to the question he had not
asked. Satisfied, he craftily made haste to reassure her.</p>
<p>'Why, no,' he said, and laughed in self-derision. 'I see now
what it is&mdash;the shadow of that gnarled olive deceived me.' He
looked at her, a smile on his full lips. 'Alas!' he said. 'You have
laid what might have become the ghost of Fra...what was his
name?'</p>
<p>'Of Fra Cristofero?' said she, and smiled back at him in her
relief. But she rose. 'Come, sir, you have sat here too long for
one in your condition.'</p>
<p>'Long enough,' said Pantaleone with more truth than she
suspected, and he rose obediently to depart.</p>
<p>It was as he said. He had sat there long enough to achieve his
ends, and the very suddenness with which now she urged his
departure was yet a further confirmation of what he had discovered.
She desired to draw him from that spot before he should chance,
indeed, to see what she believed him to have imagined he had seen.
Very willingly, then, he went.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>A fool never doubts his judgement or questions its findings. He
reaches a conclusion at a leap, and having reached it acts
forthwith upon it. And that is why he is a fool. But your really
astute fellow moves more slowly and with caution, testing the
ground at every step, mistrusting his inferences until he has
exhausted confirmation of them. Even where he is swift to conclude
he will still be slow to act unless urged by necessity to immediate
action.</p>
<p>Thus Pantaleone. He had added link to link until he held in his
hands a fairly solid chain of circumstantial evidence, from which
he was entitled to infer, firstly&mdash;and this most
positively&mdash;that Matteo Orsini was sheltered at Pievano;
secondly&mdash;and not quite so positively&mdash;that he was
bestowed in the lazar-house in that <i>hortus inclusus</i>.</p>
<p>A rash fellow would have summoned his men and forthwith stormed
the place. But Pantaleone was not rash. He counted first the cost
of error. He considered that in spite of all indications it was yet
possible that his quarry might not be in that lazar-house. And in
that case did he take any such action he would find himself in the
position of a gamester who staking all upon a single throw has seen
the dice turn up ambs-ace. He would have discovered himself in his
true character, and must submit to being driven forth in ignominy
to bear his tale of failure to his master.</p>
<p>Therefore, despite his stout convictions, Pantaleone waited and
watched, what time he took his ease at Pievano and savoured the
hospitality of the Lord Almerico. He walked in the gardens with
Madonna in the mornings, in the afternoon he would either permit
Raffaele to teach him chess or repay these lessons by showing the
golden-haired lad how to use a sword in conjunction with a dagger,
and by what tricks&mdash;not tricks of swordsmanship, indeed, but
of pure knavery&mdash;an adversary might be done to death; in the
evenings he would converse with his host, which is to say that he
would listen to the Lord Almerico's learned disquisitions upon life
culled from the philosophy of Seneca or the teachings of Epictetus
as preserved in the writings of Flavius Arrianus.</p>
<p>Pantaleone it must be confessed was a little bewildered and
wearied by these discourses. A man with his full lips, and all the
qualities those full lips implied, could find scant sense in the
austere philosophy of the stoic, though he was faintly interested
to observe the hold which that teaching had gained upon his host,
and how his host appeared to have modelled the conduct of his life
upon it, purchasing tranquillity as the stoic teaches. Although it
was not thus that Pantaleone understood existence, yet he forbore
argument and feigned agreement, knowing in his crafty way that
agreement with a man is the short road to his esteem and
confidence.</p>
<p>He earned, however, little discernible reward for all his
patient pains. No such confidences as he hoped for were ever
reposed in him. Matteo Orsini's name was never mentioned in his
presence, and when once he mentioned it himself to speak in glowing
praise of the man and in a proper sorrow at his reported death, he
was met by a silence that showed him how far indeed he was, their
amiability notwithstanding, from having earned their trust. And he
had other signs of this. On more occasions than one his sudden
coming into their presence was marked by as sudden an interruption
of the conversation between them, and the ensuing of a constrained
silence.</p>
<p>Thus a week passed in which his mission made no progress,
whereat he was beginning to grow restive, feeling that if his
inaction endured much longer it might end by thrusting him into a
rashness. No single shred of confirmation had his conclusions
received, no single grain of independent evidence that the
lazar-house was tenanted. And then, at last, one night as he was
taking his way to bed lighted by Raffaele, who was now become his
body-servant, he chanced upon a small discovery.</p>
<p>His own room was over the rocca's vast courtyard, and commanded
no other view but that. But as on his way to it he passed one of
the windows of the gallery facing southward towards that <i>hortus
inclusus</i>, and as idly he looked in that direction, he caught
the yellow glint of a point of light that was moving towards it
through the darkness.</p>
<p>He was satisfied that what he did any man in his place would
have done, and, therefore, that it could awaken no suspicion. He
stood still, looking at that light a moment, and then drew the
page's attention to it.</p>
<p>'Someone is roving in the gardens very late,' said he.</p>
<p>Raffaele came to stand beside him, and pressed his face against
the glass, the better to peer into the darkness.</p>
<p>'It will be Mario,' said the boy. 'I saw him standing by the
door when I came up.'</p>
<p>'And what the devil does he do in the garden at such an hour? He
can hardly be gathering snails at this season of the year.'</p>
<p>'Indeed, no,' agreed Raffaele, clearly intrigued.</p>
<p>'Ah, well,' said Pantaleone, who perceived that he was wasting
time, since Raffaele had no knowledge to betray. 'It is no affair
of ours.' He yawned. 'Come on, my lad, or I shall sleep where I
stand.'</p>
<p>First he thought of alluding to the matter casually upon the
morrow, watching the effect upon Almerico and his daughter. But
sleep brought sounder counsels, and when the morrow came he held
his peace. He walked as usual with Madonna in the garden, though
never now on the upper terraces whence a view was obtained of the
enclosure about the lazar-house. She had refused to repeat that
visit of theirs to the garden's heights, ever pleading that she
found the ascent excessively fatiguing.</p>
<p>Pantaleone habitually wore a tiny gold pomander ball, no larger
than a cherry, suspended from his neck by a slender chain of gold.
He wore it as usual that morning when they went forth together; but
had Madonna observed him closely she would have noted that at a
stage of their sauntering it vanished.</p>
<p>Pantaleone remained apparently unconscious of its disappearance
until towards the third hour of night&mdash;after they had supped
and when it was usual for them to retire to bed, the hour, in fact,
at which last night he had observed that mysterious light in the
garden. Then it was that quite suddenly he leapt to his feet with
an exclamation of dismay that provoked their concerned
inquiries.</p>
<p>'My pomander!' he cried, with all the air of a man whom some
great mischance has overwhelmed. 'I have lost it.'</p>
<p>My Lord Almerico recovered from his concern and smiled. He
quoted the stoic.</p>
<p>'In this life, my friend, we never lose anything. Sometimes we
return a thing. That is the proper view. Why, then, all this
concern about a pomander, a trifle that may be replaced by a
ducat.'</p>
<p>'Should I be so concerned if that were all?' cried Pantaleone,
with a faint show of impatience at the philosophy with which Orsini
bore another's loss. 'It was my talisman&mdash;a potent charm
against the evil eye given me by my sainted mother. For her sake I
hold it sacred. I would sooner lose all I have than that.'</p>
<p>It made a difference, Madonna Fulvia agreed, admiring the filial
piety he displayed; and even her father had no more to say.</p>
<p>'Let me think, now; let me think,' said Pantaleone, standing
rapt, fingering the cleft in his shaven chin. 'I had it this
morning in the garden&mdash;at least I had it when I went forth.
I...Yes!' He smote fist into palm. 'It was in the garden&mdash;it
must have been in the garden that I lost it.' And without a
by-your-leave to his host he swung to the page.</p>
<p>'A lantern, Raffaele.'</p>
<p>'Were it not wiser to wait until daylight?' wondered
Almerico.</p>
<p>'Sir, sir,' cried Pantaleone wildly, 'I could not rest, I could
not sleep in my suspense, in my uncertainty as to whether I shall
recover it or not. I will hunt for it all night if need be.'</p>
<p>They attempted further to dissuade him, but before his wild
insistence and his general air of distraction, they gave way, the
old nobleman scarcely troubling to veil a sneer at superstitions
that could take such potent hold upon a man. Since nothing less
than to go forth at once would satisfy him, they bade Raffaele go
with him, and whether this was a measure of kindly concern or
whether of precaution, Pantaleone was by no means sure.</p>
<p>Forth into the night sallied he and Raffaele, each armed with a
lantern, and straight they went to the first terrace. With their
double light they searched every foot of the long walk, all to no
purpose.</p>
<p>'Five ducats, Raffaele, if you find it,' said Pantaleone. 'Let
us divide our forces, thus are we likely to shorten the search. Do
you go up to the next terrace, and search that carefully, foot by
foot. Five ducats if you find it.'</p>
<p>'Five ducats!' Raffaele was a little breathless. 'Why the thing
isn't worth more than half a ducat!'</p>
<p>'Nevertheless five shall you have if you find it me. I value it
far above its price.'</p>
<p>Raffaele sped upwards with his lantern, leaving Pantaleone in
the act of resuming his search over ground that had been covered
already The adventurer waited until the sound of the lad's
footsteps had grown distant and until from where he stood the
other's light was no longer visible. Then he passed behind a stiff
box hedge, that would screen his own light from any windows of the
house, and there without more ado he extinguished it. That done he
crossed the garden with as much speed as was consistent with his
care to make no sound. By a clump of larches within a dozen paces
of the wall of the enclosure he came to a halt, effaced himself
among the trees, and waited, watchful and listening.</p>
<p>Moments passed in utter silence. In the distance he could
perceive the faint gleam of Raffaele's lantern moving at a snail's
pace along the third terrace on the hillside. Raffaele he knew was
safely engaged for the next hour. That promise of five ducats would
sustain his patience against failure. Whilst any who might be
spying from the house would be able to make out no more than a
glimmer of light up yonder, and would suppose that Raffaele and
himself were engaged together.</p>
<p>Reassured on that score, then, Pantaleone was patient on his
side, and waited. Nor was his patience sorely taxed. Some ten
minutes or so after he had gained his point of observation, he
heard the creaking of a door, and from the postern in the inner
barbican he beheld the gleam of another lantern. It advanced
swiftly towards him&mdash;for a pathway ran beside the
larches&mdash;and presently there came the sound of feet. Soon
Pantaleone could discern the figure of a man faintly outlined
against the all-pervading gloom.</p>
<p>Immovable he stood screened by the larches, unseen yet
observing. The figure advanced; it passed so closely by him that by
putting forth his arm he might have touched it. He recognized the
livid pock-marked face of the castellan, and he noted that the
fellow carried a basket slung on the crook of his left arm. He
caught the faint gleam of napery atop of it, and thrusting forth
from this the neck of a wine-flask.</p>
<p>The man passed on, and reached the wall. A green door was set in
it just thereabouts, and Pantaleone was prepared to see him vanish
through, preparing indeed to follow. Instead, however, Mario paused
at the wall's foot some ten paces away from that door, and
Pantaleone caught the sound of hands softly clapped, and a voice
softly calling:</p>
<p>'Are you there, Colomba?'</p>
<p>Instantly from beyond the wall floated the answer in a woman's
voice:</p>
<p>'I am here.'</p>
<p>What followed was none so distinct, and asked for guesswork on
Pantaleone's part. Partly he saw and partly inferred that Mario had
taken a ladder that lay at the wall's foot, set it against the
wall, mounted it, and from the summit slung down his basket to his
wife within the enclosure.</p>
<p>That was all. The thing being done, Mario descended again,
removed the ladder, and returned unencumbered now and moving
swiftly.</p>
<p>Pantaleone found his every suspicion confirmed. As he had
supposed, Colomba and the groom Giuberti were ministering to the
concealed Matteo Orsini, whose food was borne to him thus in the
night by Mario&mdash;and no doubt in the raw, to be cooked and
prepared by Mario's wife&mdash;so that none in Pievano should share
the secret with those who already and perforce were in possession
of it.</p>
<p>All this was clear as daylight. But on the other hand the affair
had its dark and mysterious side. Why should Mario employ a ladder
to scale a wall when there was a door there ready to his hand. It
was very odd, but it was some detail of precaution, he supposed,
and dismissed the matter with that explanation.</p>
<p>Moreover something was happening that suddenly drew his
attention to himself and his own position. Mario, instead of
returning to the house, had paused midway a moment, as if
hesitating, and then had struck across the gardens towards the
light that marked the spot where Raffaele hunted.</p>
<p>Now this to Messer Pantaleone was a serious matter. It might,
unless he were careful, lead to the discovery of his own real
pursuits. He came forth from his concealment and very softly set
himself to follow Mario. Thus as far as the second terrace. Then as
Mario still went on upwards, Pantaleone turned quickly away to the
right, thus returning to the very spot where he had extinguished
his lantern. Arrived there, he turned and came running back
shouting as he ran:</p>
<p>'Raffaele! Raffaele!'</p>
<p>He saw the swinging lantern of Mario arrested in its progress,
and a moment later farther along the upper terrace gleamed
Raffaele's light, as the boy approached the edge in answer to that
summons.</p>
<p>'I have found it!' cried Pantaleone, as indeed he had found
it&mdash;in his pocket where it had been safely bestowed.</p>
<p>'I have found it...found it!' he repeated on a note of
ridiculous triumph, as if he were Columbus announcing that he had
found the New World.</p>
<p>He advanced to the foot of the flight of steps that led upward,
and there he awaited them.</p>
<p>'You have found it?' quoth Raffaele, crestfallen.</p>
<p>Pantaleone dangled it aloft by the chain.</p>
<p>'Behold!' he said, and added&mdash;'but you shall have a ducat
for your pains none the less. So comfort you.'</p>
<p>'Did you find it in the dark?' It was Mario's voice that growled
the question, and Pantaleone was quick to catch the note of
suspicion running through it.</p>
<p>'Fool,' he answered, preferring to take him literally. 'How
could I have found it in the dark? I upset my lantern in my
excitement.'</p>
<p>Mario was scanning his face closely.</p>
<p>'It is very odd,' said he, 'that as I came this way I saw no
light.'</p>
<p>'I was beyond the hedge yonder. That may have screened it,'
Pantaleone explained, and added no word more, for he knew that who
explains himself too much accuses himself.</p>
<p>They trooped back to the house together; Raffaele silenced by
his disappointment, Mario thoughtful and suspicious of all this
ado, Pantaleone babbling naively in his delight at the recovery of
his precious amulet, and recounting the circumstances under which
his mother had set it round his neck, with what words she had
enjoined him to keep it safe, and against what dreadful perils it
had been his shield&mdash;all lies that came bubbling from his
fertile mind like water from a spring.</p>
<p>But despite all this, when at length he came to bid good night
to Mario, he saw that clay-coloured face grimly set in lines of
mistrust.</p>
<p>He went thoughtfully to bed in consequence. He lay awake some
time considering his discovery and considering still more deeply
that part of it which left him mystified. At another time he might
have delayed his action until he had cleared that up. But here he
decided that to delay further might be dangerous. He told himself
again that he had discovered all that mattered, and he fell asleep
promising himself that upon the morrow he would act upon that
discovery and lay Messer Matteo Orsini snugly by the heels.</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>The manner adopted by Messer Pantaleone in which to do the thing
he had been sent to do was startling and yet precisely such as was
to have been looked for in a man of his temper.</p>
<p>He had been that day&mdash;the day following upon the affair of
the lost amulet&mdash;down into the borgo of Pievano for the first
time since his coming to the castle. As a pretext for this he had
urged the need to mend the leg of one of his boots which had become
torn during his search last night. (Himself he had ripped it with
his dagger.)</p>
<p>He had made his way in the first place to a cobbler, with whom
perforce he remained until the required repairs had been effected.
From the cobbler's he went to the Osteria del Orso, ostensibly to
refresh himself, actually to issue his orders to his knaves through
the one he had posted there. It resulted from these movements of
his that as dusk was falling his tenesbirri wandered singly and
unchallenged over the drawbridge into the empty courtyard of the
castle. No guards were kept at Pievano, as we know, and so this
furtive and piecemeal invasion was neither hindered nor yet so much
as observed.</p>
<p>When he had assured himself that these knaves of his were at
hand, Messer Pantaleone, armed, booted, spurred, cap in hand, and
wrapped in his ample red cloak&mdash;obviously ready to take the
road forthwith&mdash;strode into the hall of the rocca, that noble
chamber where a week ago he had been so charitably received. Now,
as then, he found the Lord Almerico engrossed in a volume of
manuscript, and Madonna Fulvia with him.</p>
<p>They looked up sharply, inexplicably startled by the manner of
his advent. There was a subtle change in his air. It was more
arrogant and self-assertive than usual; here was no longer the
guest with just so much swagger as was inseparable from a soldier
of fortune, but one who seemed to come mantled in authority. He did
not long intrigue them.</p>
<p>'My lord,' he announced bluntly, 'I have a duty to perform and
ten stout fellows below to help me against the need of help. Will
you summon your nephew Matteo Orsini who is hiding here?'</p>
<p>They stared at him in utter silence, whilst for as long as it
would take a man to say a paternoster. They were like people
stupefied. Then at last the girl spoke, her brows contracted, her
eyes flashing like sombre jewels in her white face.</p>
<p>'What is your purpose with Matteo?'</p>
<p>'The lord Cesare Borgia's purpose,' he answered brutally. The
mask of guile having served its turn was now discarded, and there
was no tinge of shame upon the uncovered face of his real self
which he now showed them. 'I was sent hither to arrest Ser Matteo
by order of the Duke.'</p>
<p>Again there fell a pause, what time those four eyes searched his
bold countenance. The lord Almerico closed his book upon his
forefinger, and a faint yet intensely scornful smile broke upon the
grey old face.</p>
<p>'Then,' said Madonna Fulvia, 'all this time we...we have been
your dupes. You lied to us. Your faintness, the persecution of
which you were the victim, was all so much pretence?' There was a
note of incredulity in her voice.</p>
<p>'Necessity,' he reminded her, 'knows no law.' And although he
was neither shamed nor daunted by their steadfast scornful stare,
yet he grew weary of it. 'Come,' he added roughly. 'You have had
your fill of looking at me. Let us get to business. Send for this
traitor you are harbouring.'</p>
<p>Madonna Fulvia drew herself stiffly up. 'My God!' she exclaimed.
'A base Judas, a dirty spy! And I have sat at table with you. We
have housed you here as an equal.' Her voice soared upwards, from
the low note of horror and disgust upon which she had spoken. 'O
vile, O pitiful dog!' she cried. 'Was this your errand? Was
this...'</p>
<p>Her father's hand fell gently upon her arm, and silenced her by
its mute command. The stoic in him was equal even to so bitter an
occasion. It was not for nothing that he had assimilated the wisdom
of the ancients.</p>
<p>'Hush, child, self-respect forbids that you should address so
base a creature even to upbraid it.' His voice was calm and level.
'What is it to you that he is vile and treacherous, a shameless
thing of shame? Does that hurt you? Does it hurt any but
himself?'</p>
<p>It did not seem to her to be a time for stoicisms. She swung
upon her father in a blaze of passion.</p>
<p>'Aye, does it hurt me,' she cried. 'It hurts me and it hurts
Matteo.'</p>
<p>'Can it really hurt a man to die?' wondered Almerico. 'Matteo
being dead, shall yet live. But that poor thing being living is yet
dead.'</p>
<p>'Shall we come to business?' quoth Pantaleone, breaking in upon
what promised to develop into an eloquent discourse upon life and
death, chiefly derived from Seneca. 'Will you send for Matteo
Orsini, or shall I bid my men drag him from the lazar-home where he
skulks. It is idle to resist, futile to delay. My knaves have
hemmed the place about, and none goes in or out save at my
pleasure.'</p>
<p>He saw a change of expression sweep across both faces. The
girl's eyes dilated&mdash;with fear, as he supposed; the old man
uttered a short, sharp laugh&mdash;of stoicism he opined.</p>
<p>'Why, sir,' said Almerico, 'since you are so well informed, you
had best yourself complete your task of infamy.'</p>
<p>Pantaleone looked at him a moment, and then shrugged.</p>
<p>'Be it so,' he said shortly, and swung upon his heel to go about
it. 'No, no!' It was Madonna Fulvia who arrested him with that cry,
sharp with a new anxiety. 'Wait, sir! Wait!'</p>
<p>He paused obediently, and half-turned. He beheld her standing
tense and straight, one hand pressed upon her bosom as if to quell
its tumult, the other held out to him in a gesture of
supplication.</p>
<p>'Give me leave to speak with my father alone, ere...ere we
decide,' she panted.</p>
<p>Pantaleone sniffed, and raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>'Decide?' quoth he. 'What remains to be decided?'</p>
<p>She wrung her hands in a pathetic intensity of mental stress.
'We...we may have a proposal to make to you, sir.'</p>
<p>'A proposal?' He said, and scowled. Did they seek to bribe him?
'By the Host...' he began hotly, and there checked. The cupidity of
his nature leapt up instantly, aroused and alert. After all, he
bethought him, there would be no harm in hearing this proposal. The
man is a fool who neglects to learn anything from which he may cull
personal advantage. He considered further. After all, none save
himself was aware of Matteo Orsini's presence at Pievano, and if
the price were high enough&mdash;who knew?&mdash;he might be
induced to keep that knowledge to himself. But the price must needs
be high to compensate him not only for the loss of the thousand
ducats offered by the Duke but for the hurt his vanity would suffer
in the admission of failure.</p>
<p>Seeing him silent, and conceiving that he hesitated, Madonna
renewed her prayer.</p>
<p>'What harm can it do to grant me this?' she asked. 'Have you not
said yourself that the place is hemmed about by your men? Are you
not therefore master of the situation?'</p>
<p>He bowed stiffly.</p>
<p>'I will concede it you,' he said. 'I shall await your pleasure
in the ante-chamber.' And upon that he went out, his spurs jingling
musically.</p>
<p>Left alone father and daughter looked long at each other.</p>
<p>'Why did you hinder him?' asked the lord of Pievano at length.
'Surely you were not moved by any thought of pity for such a
man?'</p>
<p>Her lip curled in a scornful smile. 'You cannot think
that&mdash;not in your heart,' she said.</p>
<p>'It is because I cannot think it that I ask. I am all
bewildered.'</p>
<p>'Had we allowed him to go, consider what in his vengeance he
might have done. He might have summoned these men of his, and
ransacked the rocca until he discovered Matteo indeed.'</p>
<p>'But surely that must inevitably follow now. How can we prevent
it?'</p>
<p>She leaned towards him. 'To what purpose do you study so deeply
the lore of human nature if in practice you cannot probe the
shallow murky depth of such a nature as this dog's?'</p>
<p>He shrank back, staring at her, feeling that his philosophy had
taught him nothing indeed if in an extremity such as the present
one, this child could show him how it should be handled.</p>
<p>'Do you not know&mdash;does it not say so in any of those
pages&mdash;that who betrays once, will betray again and yet again?
Do you not see that a man so vile as to have played that knave's
part will be vile enough to sell his own master, will be true to
naught save his own base interests?'</p>
<p>'You mean that we should bribe him?'</p>
<p>She drew herself up and uttered a short laugh. 'I mean that we
should seem to bribe him. Oh!' She pressed her hands to her white
brow. 'I have a vision of something that lies before us here. It is
as if a door had been opened, a weapon thrust into my hand by means
of which I can smite and at a blow avenge all the wrongs of the
Orsini.'</p>
<p>'Pish, you are fevered, child! Here is no work for a weak
maid...'</p>
<p>'Not for a weak maid&mdash;no; but for a strong one,' she broke
in impetuously; 'work for a woman of the Orsini. Listen.' She
leaned towards him again, lowering her voice instinctively because
of the secret thing she had to communicate. Speaking quickly now
she expounded the whole plan that had flashed into her ready witted
mind, a plan complete in its every detail, a chain whose every link
was soundly forged.</p>
<p>He listened, hunched in his chair, and the farther she proceeded
the more hunched he became, like one who instinctively gathers
himself together against a blow that is about to fall.</p>
<p>'My God!' he gasped when she had done, and his old eyes stared
at her between amazement and dismay. 'My God! And your pure virgin
mind has conceived this horror! In all these years I have not known
you, Fulvia. I have deemed you a child, and you...' Words eluded
him. Limply he waved his old transparent hands. The stoic in him
had succumbed to the parent.</p>
<p>He would have dissuaded her out of his deep concern for her, his
only child. But she was not to be dissuaded. She argued on,
gathering enthusiasm as she dwelt upon the means by which she would
at a single blow strike down this base betrayer and his master the
Duke of Valentinois. She urged that there was no safety for her or
him or any Orsini in her refraining from this step upon which she
was resolved. She reminded him that as long as Cesare Borgia lived
no single Orsini would be safe, and she concluded by announcing
that she believed her mission inspired by Heaven itself, that she a
maid and the weakest of the Orsini should avenge the wrongs of
their house and stay its further ruin.</p>
<p>At last his shocked, bruised mind became infected by something
of her ardour; enough at least to wring from him a grudging fearful
consent to let her have her way.</p>
<p>'Leave me,' she said, 'to deal with Cesare Borgia and his
lackey, and do you pray for the souls of both.'</p>
<p>Upon that she kissed him, and swept out to the impatient
Pantaleone waiting in the sparsely furnished ante-chamber.</p>
<p>He was seated in a high-backed chair by a carved table that bore
a cluster of candles in a silver branch. He rose as she entered,
marking her pallor and obvious agitation. To the stately beauty of
her, her slim height and the fine poise of her lovely head, he
remained indifferent.</p>
<p>She came to lean against the table, facing him across it,
considering him with a glance that was steady despite the tremors
agitating all the rest of her.</p>
<p>Pantaleone was shrewd and crafty as we know, but his craft was a
shallow business when compared with her own; his shrewdness was
mere low cunning when contrasted with the agile wits which her
frail exterior dissembled.</p>
<p>In the moment in which he had revealed himself for what he was
she had judged him, and she had judged him to the weight of a hair
of his vile head. Upon that judgement she now went to work.
'Consider me well, Ser Pantaleone,' she invited him, her voice
level and calm.</p>
<p>He did so, wondering whither this might lead.</p>
<p>'Tell me now, do you not find me fair to see, and am I not
shapely?'</p>
<p>He bowed, his face almost sardonic. 'Fair as an angel,
assuredly, Madonna. The Duke's own sister, Madonna Lucrezia, would
suffer by comparison. But what has this to do with...?'</p>
<p>'In short, sir, do you account me desirable?'</p>
<p>The question robbed him of breath, so amazing was it. It was a
moment ere he found an answer, and by then the sardonic smile had
passed entirely from his face. His pulses were quickened under her
steady glance and her no less steady invitation to appraise her. He
pondered her now, and discovered a thousand graces in her to which
he had hitherto been blind. He may even have realized that her
chaste frail beauty held a subtler appeal than the grosser
femininity to which his senses more usually responded.</p>
<p>'Desirable as Paradise,' said he at last, dropping his
voice.</p>
<p>'And to render me so, there is not merely this perishable beauty
that is mine. I am well dowered.'</p>
<p>'It is fitting that so noble a jewel should be nobly set.' In
his mind stirred now some inkling of whither she was leading him,
and his pulses throbbed the faster.</p>
<p>'A matter of ten thousand ducats goes with me to the man I wed,'
she informed him, and turned him giddy by the mention of so vast a
sum.</p>
<p>'Ten thousand ducats?' he repeated slowly, awe-stricken.</p>
<p>'To the man who weds me,' she insisted, and added
quietly&mdash;'Will you be that man?'</p>
<p>'Will I...?' He checked. No, no. The thing was incredible. The
shock of that question almost stunned him. He gaped at her, and his
handsome face turned pale under its tan.</p>
<p>'Upon the condition, of course,' she pursued, 'that you abandon
this quest for Ser Matteo, and bear word to your master that he is
not to be found.'</p>
<p>'Of course, of course,' he mumbled foolishly. Then he
reassembled his scattered wits and set them to read him this
riddle. She was Matteo's betrothed. She loved Matteo. And yet...Or
could it be that her love was of that great self-sacrificing kind
of which he had heard&mdash;but in which he had never
believed&mdash;that will surrender all for the sake of the beloved?
He could not swallow that. It was not in his nature to be so
credulous. And then he threw up his head, his nostrils quivering.
Suddenly he scented danger. A trap was being baited for him.
Bluntly he said so, laughing short and scornfully.</p>
<p>But her reply disarmed his last suspicion.</p>
<p>'Take your own measures,' she invited him serenely. 'I
understand your fears. But we are honourable folk, and if I swear
to you that Matteo Orsini shall not stir him hence until this
matter is done beyond recalling, so shall it be. Yet take your
measures. You have the men and the power. Let them remain at their
post surrounding that garden. Do that tonight, and tomorrow I will
ride with you to Castel della Pieve to become your wife.'</p>
<p>Slowly he licked his lips, and his bold eyes narrowed as they
surveyed her greedily. Yet still he was suspicious. Still he could
not believe in so much good fortune.</p>
<p>'Why at Castel della Pieve?' he asked. 'Why not here?'</p>
<p>'Because I must be sure that you will keep faith. Castel della
Pieve is the nearest place&mdash;yet far enough to leave Matteo a
clear road of flight.'</p>
<p>'I understand,' he said slowly.</p>
<p>'And you agree?'</p>
<p>His keen black eyes stabbed into her calm white face as though
they would pierce to her very soul and probe its secrets. It was
incredible. To have fortune thrust upon him thus, fortune and a
wife, and such a wife; for in his eyes she was growing more
desirable moment by moment as he considered her. Had not Fra
Serafino warned the Duke that this man would be as wax in the hands
of a woman?</p>
<p>What greater profit&mdash;what profit one-tenth as great could
he look for in taking Ser Matteo, in keeping faith with
Valentinois? He made, you see, no attempt to struggle with the
temptation. He did not give so much as a thought to a young woman
in the Bolognese&mdash;one Leocadia by name&mdash;who kept a
wine-shop at Laveno, who had borne him a son and whom he had
promised to marry. But all that had happened before he had risen to
the rank of a condottiero and earned the regard and trust of Cesare
Borgia; and of late in his new-found importance it had shrunk into
a dim and distant background. It did not trouble him now. If he
hesitated, it was only because the thing proposed him was beyond
belief. It bewildered him; a fog settled down upon his wits. By the
Host! How she must love this fellow Matteo! Or was it&mdash;was it
perhaps that he himself...</p>
<p>Now here was a possibility hitherto unregarded; here something
that might explain her singular attitude towards him. In saving
Matteo she performed a duty, and by the very manner of it placed a
barrier between herself and a lover of whom she had wearied.</p>
<p>Thus his vanity to complete the rout of his perspicuity, to
convince him where cold reason failed.</p>
<p>'Agree?' he cried after that long pause. 'Agree? By the Eyes of
God? Am I a wooden image, or a purblind fool to refuse? I'll set a
seal forthwith upon that contract.' And with arms flung wide he
swooped down upon her like a hawk upon a dove, and caught her to
him.</p>
<p>She suffered it, stiff and cold with sudden terror and repressed
loathing. He held her close and muttered foolish fondnesses. Then
the awakened passion mounting, it became suffused with tenderness,
and he told her of a future in which he should be the slave of her
slightest whim, her devout and worshipping lover always.</p>
<p>At length she released herself from those lithe arms, and drew
away from him, a hectic spot on either cheek, deep shame in her
soul and a sense of defilement pervading all her being. He watched
her, abashed a little, mistrustful even.</p>
<p>But when she had gained the door she paused, and there for an
instant her iciness melted. Her laugh trilled softly across the
chamber to him.</p>
<p>'Tomorrow!' she flung at him, and vanished leaving him
distracted.</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p>Perplexed, yet true to his adventurer's character, determined to
follow his fortunes and accept such chances as there might be,
Pantaleone took his measures against possible treachery, posted his
men for the night so as to make quite certain that his prey did not
escape until Madonna Fulvia and himself should be on their way to
the nuptials, and that done went to bed to dream of a roseate
future ennobled by ten thousand ducats.</p>
<p>It is the test of your true adventurer in all ages and of all
kinds that ducats are with him the sole standard of nobility. A man
may pawn his honour, pledge his proper pride and sell his immortal
soul, so that he drives a good bargain in the matter of ducats.
Thus it was with Pantaleone. Unless you are yourself one of those
who measure worth&mdash;your own or another's&mdash;by ducats, you
will pity a little this man who set such store by profit. For the
thousand ducats offered him by the Duke he had consented to act the
part of a Judas and a traitor. For the ten thousand ducats now
dangled before his eyes he was ready to betray the hand that had
hired him; and the sad part of it all is that he was convinced he
did a shrewd and clever thing. That is why I invite your pity for
him. He needs it both in this and in what is to follow out of it.
Had he realized his baseness, he would have been just a villain.
But far from it, since his baseness brought him profit he accounted
himself a clever and deserving man. He was a true product of his
age, and yet his kind has existed multitudinously in all ages.</p>
<p>Whilst he dreamt his aureate dreams, Madonna Fulvia below stairs
was planning his destruction and another's. She indited a note
calculatedly enigmatic and brief that it might provoke curiosity
and through this the response which she desired. She couched it in
an odd mixture of curial Latin and the common language of the
people.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Magnificent (<i>Magnifice Vir</i>)&mdash;You are betrayed by one
whom you hired to a betrayal. Before the Duomo of Castel della
Pieve punctually at high noon tomorrow I will afford you proof of
it if your Illustrious Magnificence is pleased to be there to
receive it.<br>
Your Servant (<i>Servitrix vestra</i>),<br>
FULVIA ORSINI.<br>
<br></p>
<p>From the Rocca of Pievano this 20th day of January, 1503<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>And under her signature she added the two words 'Manu propria,'
which her self-respect seemed to demand of her. Then came the
superscription:<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>To the Illustrious Prince, the Duke of Valentinois these<br>
Quickly<br>
Quickly<br>
Quickly.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>As she shook the pounce over the wet ink, she called Raffaele,
who lay prone upon an Eastern rug before the fire, kicking his
heels in the air. Instantly he leapt to her summons.</p>
<p>She set her hands upon his shoulders, and looked steadily into
his lovely face.</p>
<p>'Will you do a man's work for me, Raffaele? I have need of a
man, and there is none here whom I can spare. Will you ride tonight
to Cesare Borgia's camp at Castel della Pieve with this
letter?'</p>
<p>'If that be all that is needed to prove myself a man, account it
proven,' said he.</p>
<p>'Good lad! Dear lad! Now listen. There may be spies about the
gate, and so it were best you went forth on foot from here. If you
can slip out unseen it will be better still. Then go down into the
borgo to the house of Villanelli. Bid him lend you a horse for my
service, but say no word even to him of whither you ride. Be
circumspect and swift.'</p>
<p>'Trust me, Madonna,' said the lad, slipping the letter into the
breast of his doublet.</p>
<p>'I do, else I should not charge you with this message. God watch
over you! Send Mario to me as you go.'</p>
<p>He went forthwith, and soon came Mario in answer to her
summons.</p>
<p>'How is it with Giuberti tonight?' she asked the seneschal as he
entered.</p>
<p>He shrugged despondently. 'I doubt if the poor fellow will be
alive by morning,' he answered.</p>
<p>Her face was drawn and grave, her eyes sad. 'Poor lad!' she
said. 'Is the end indeed so near.'</p>
<p>'A miracle might save him. Nothing less. But miracles do not
happen now.'</p>
<p>She paced slowly to the hearth, her face thoughtful, her eyes
bent upon the ground. Thus she stood for a long moment, Mario
waiting.</p>
<p>'Mario,' she said at last, speaking very quietly. There is a
service I require of you this night&mdash;of you and Colomba.'</p>
<p>'We are yours to command, Madonna,' he replied.</p>
<p>Yet when she had told him what the service was she saw him
recoil, aghast, horror stamped upon that face which the ravages of
disease had made so horrible.</p>
<p>At that she fell to pleading with him, and with a burning
eloquence she set forth the wrongs her house had suffered, spoke of
the Orsini blood that had been shed to gratify Borgian ambition and
to satiate Borgian vengeance, and so in the end won him to her
will.</p>
<p>'Be it so, then, Madonna, since you desire it,' he said, but he
shuddered even as he spoke. 'Have you the letter written?'</p>
<p>'Not yet. Come to me again soon, and it shall be ready.'</p>
<p>In silence he departed, and she returned to the writing pulpit.
For awhile she could not write, such was the tremor of her hand as
a consequence of the agitation her interview with Mario had
produced in her. Presently, however, she recovered her
self-control, and thereafter for a spell there was no sound in the
chamber, save the occasional splutter and crackle of the burning
logs and the scratch of her busy quill.</p>
<p>Mario returned before she had finished, and stood waiting
patiently until rising she flung down her pen, and proffered him
the accomplished document.</p>
<p>'You understand?' she said.</p>
<p>'I understand, Madonna. God knows it is simple&mdash;terribly
simple.' And he looked at her with eyes of sorrow, conveying by his
glance that what he found so terrible was that one so young and
lovely should have conceived a notion so diabolical as this in
which she had besought his aid.</p>
<p>'And you will instruct Colomba carefully so that there is no
mistake.'</p>
<p>'There will be none,' he promised. 'I have the cane, and I
myself will prepare it. A thorn is easily procured.'</p>
<p>'Let me have it, then, at daybreak. Bring it to my chamber. You
will find me risen, and ready for a journey.'</p>
<p>At that he was gripped by a fresh alarm. 'You are not yourself
to be the bearer of it?' he cried out.</p>
<p>'Whom else?' she asked him. 'Could I demand such a service of
any other?'</p>
<p>'Gesù!' he wailed. 'Does my lord know of this?'</p>
<p>'Something of it. Enough of it. Not a word more now, Mario. Away
with you, and see it done.'</p>
<p>'Ah, but consider, Madonna, what you risk! Consider, Madonna, I
beseech you.'</p>
<p>'I have considered. I am an Orsini. Orsini have been strangled
at Assisi, others are gaoled in Rome. Matteo's life is sought by
this insatiable monster of revenge. I go there both to save and to
avenge. I shall not fail.'</p>
<p>'Ah, but Madonna mine...' he began, his voice quavering, tears
of intercession gathering in his eyes.</p>
<p>'No more, as you love me, Mario. Do my will. You cannot alter
it.'</p>
<p>The tone invested with a stern inflexibility that never before
had he known in her&mdash;and he had known her from her very
birth&mdash;made an end of his protests. She was the mistress, he
the servant, almost the slave, owing unquestioning obedience. And
so Mario, heavy hearted, went his ways to do as she commanded,
whilst she followed soon thereafter to seek what sleep she could,
and in that sleep the strength to perform the task that lay before
her.</p>
<p>The morning found her pale but calm when she came to confront
her bridegroom in the hall.</p>
<p>The lord of Pievano kept his chamber. Not all his stoicism was
equal to the ordeal of sitting down to meat again with such a thing
as Pantaleone, or witnessing the humiliation to which his daughter
was to subject herself. However much he might esteem the end in
view&mdash;since he was an Orsini before being a
philosopher&mdash;he abhorred the means, and took the course of
refusing them his countenance, and remaining passive. Yet&mdash;in
justice to him be it said&mdash;of a certainty he would not have
remained so had he known her full intent. A part of it only had she
revealed to him.</p>
<p>Pantaleone was tortured between elation at the extraordinary
good fortune that had so unexpectedly been flung into his lap and
an irrepressible misgiving, an incredulity, a doubt as to its
genuineness. Something of this was reflected in his glance as he
came now into her presence. It had lost much of its habitual
arrogant confidence; it seemed even a little strained.</p>
<p>He crossed to her, swaggering, since to swagger was natural to
him; but there was none of the air of proprietorship that naturally
was to be looked for in such a man towards the woman whom he had
won to wife. Indeed, it was almost with humility that he took her
hand, and bore it to his lips, she suffering it in the same icy
detachment in which last night she had suffered his terrible
embrace.</p>
<p>They sat down to table to break their fast, with none to wait
upon them but the silent sphinx-like Mario. Even Raffaele was
absent, and Pantaleone had missed the pert lad's ministrations on
that morning of mornings.</p>
<p>He commented upon this, as much to ease the increasing strain of
their silence as because he desired to know what had become of the
page. Madonna excused the boy, saying that he was none so well and
kept his bed. The truth was that he had but sought it a half-hour
ago, upon his return from his ride to Castel della Pieve and the
safe delivery of his letter.</p>
<p>They set out soon after, and took the road by the marsh towards
Castel della Pieve. With them went Pantaleone's ten knaves, and
Mario as Madonna's equerry by her insistence. Pantaelone disliked
and mistrusted the silent clay-faced servant and would gladly have
been rid of his presence. Yet he deemed it wise to humour her at
least until a priest should have given her fully into his
possession.</p>
<p>As they cantered briskly forward in the bright sunshine of that
January morning, and the miles were flung behind them, Pantaleone's
spirits rose, and conquered his last misgiving. Of treachery he had
now no shadow of fear. Had she not delivered herself up to him?
Were they not surrounded by men of his own? And must not the ducats
and the rest follow as inevitably as the rising of tomorrow's sun?
In this assurance he attempted to play the gallant, as befits a
bridegroom: but he found her cold and haughty and reserved, and
when he remonstrated, pointing out that she did not use him at all
like one who was to be her husband by noontide, she retorted with a
reminder that between them was naught but a bargain that had been
struck.</p>
<p>This chilled him, and for a while he rode amain sulkily, with
bent head and furrowed brows. But that soon passed. His abiding
humour was too buoyant to suffer any permanent overclouding. Let
her be as cold as ice at present. Anon he would know how to kindle
her into living woman. He had so kindled a many in his day, and he
was confident of his natural gifts in that direction. Not that it
would greatly matter if she were to remain proof against his
ardour. There were her ducats for ample consolation, and with her
ducats he might procure elsewhere an abundance of the tenderness
that she denied him.</p>
<p>They toiled up a gentle hill, and then from its summit the
gleaming ruddy roofs of Castel della Pieve broke at last upon their
view, some two leagues distant. It wanted yet an hour to noon, and
if they maintained their present pace they would arrive too soon
for Madonna's schemes. Therefore she now delayed by slacking her
pace a little, pleading fatigue as a result of a ride that was
something arduous for one so little used to the saddle. And she
contrived so well that noon was striking from the Duomo as they
rode under the deep archway of the Porta Pia and entered the
town.</p>
<h3>VII</h3>
<p>The Duke's army was encamped upon the eastern side of the city,
so that Pantaleone had no inkling of his master's presence there
until they had entered the main street and saw the abundant
evidences of it in the soldiers that thronged everywhere chattering
in all the dialects of Middle Italy. The part he had played at
Pievano had so isolated Pantaleone from the outside world, that he
had remained without precise knowledge of Cesare Borgia's
whereabouts. His sudden realization that he had ridden almost into
the very presence of the Duke was as a shower of cold water upon
his heated body. For you will understand that engaged as he was he
had every reason to avoid the Duke as he would avoid the devil.</p>
<p>He reined in sharply, and his eyes glared mistrustfully at
Madonna, instinctively feeling that here was some trap into which
like a fool he had been lured by this white-faced girl. It flashed
across his mind that it had been his lifelong practice to mistrust
lean women. Their very leanness was in his eyes an outward sign of
their lack of femininity, and a woman that lacks
femininity&mdash;as all the world knows&mdash;is as often as not a
very devil.</p>
<p>'By your leave, Madonna,' said he grimly, 'we will seek a priest
elsewhere.'</p>
<p>'Why so?' she asked.</p>
<p>'Because it is my will,' he snarled back.</p>
<p>She smiled a crooked little smile. She was calm and mistress of
herself.</p>
<p>'It is early yet to impose your will upon me, and if you are
overinsistent now, perhaps you never shall&mdash;for I marry you at
Castel della Pieve or I do not marry you at all.'</p>
<p>He looked at her blenching with anger. 'God's Blood!' he swore,
and gave tongue to that thought of his. 'I never yet knew a lean
woman that was not sly and a very bag of devil's tricks. What is in
that mind of yours?'</p>
<p>And then suddenly a hoarse voice hailed him, and from among the
passers-by there rolled forward a grizzled veteran upon sturdy
bowed legs, a swarthy one-eyed fellow, who creaked and clanked as
he walked, being all mail and leather. It was Valentinois' captain,
Taddeo della Volpe.</p>
<p>'Well returned, my Pantaleone!' he cried. 'The Duke named you
but yesterday, wondering how you fared.'</p>
<p>'Did he so?' said Pantaleone since he must say something, raging
inwardly to find his retreat cut off by this most inopportune
encounter.</p>
<p>The veteran rolled his single eye in the direction of Madonna
Fulvia. 'Is this the prisoner you were sent to capture?' quoth he,
and Pantaleone could not be sure that he was not being mocked. 'But
I delay you. You'll be for the Duke. I'll go with you'.</p>
<p>Now here was Pantaleone in desperate straits. Mechanically he
moved forward with Taddeo, since to obey his very natural impulse
and turn about to retreat by the way he had come was now utterly
impossible. Nor could he question Madonna as he desired to do
whilst Della Volpe stalked there beside him.</p>
<p>A dozen paces brought them to the open space before the Duomo,
and there Pantaleone grew cold with fear to find himself almost
face to face with Cesare Borgia himself, who rode amid a group of
courtiers followed by a file of men-at-arms from whose lances
fluttered the bannerols with the Borgia device of the Red Bull.</p>
<p>He was in the trap. He had been led into it by the nose like a
fool by this whey-faced Orsini girl, and he lacked even the
strength to brace himself against the snapping of its springs. As
he checked his horse, mechanically in his dismay, Madonna Fulvia
dealt her own a cut across the hams that launched it forward as
from a catapult.</p>
<p>'Justice!' she cried, brandishing above her head what looked
like a short truncheon. 'Lord Duke of Valentinois, justice!'</p>
<p>There was a commotion in the magnificent group about his
Highness. The wild bound of her horse had brought her almost into
the midst of it.</p>
<p>The Duke raised his hand, and the cavalcade came to a sudden
halt. His splendid eyes swept over her, and there was something in
his glance that seemed to scorch her.</p>
<p>She beheld now for the first time this man, the enemy of her
house, one whom she had come to consider a very monster. He was
dressed in black, in the Spanish fashion, his doublet scrolled with
golden arabesques, his velvet cap laced with a string of
smouldering rubies large as sparrow's eggs. From under this the
wave of his bronze-coloured hair fell to his shoulders. The
delicate yet essentially male beauty of his young face was such
that for a moment it checked her cruel purpose.</p>
<p>A smile, gentle, almost wistful, broke upon that noble
countenance, and he spoke in a voice that was soft and full of
melody.</p>
<p>'What justice do you seek, Madonna?'</p>
<p>To combat the sweet seduction of his face and voice she had need
in that hour to bethink her of her cousins strangled at Assisi, of
those other kinsmen gaoled in Rome and like to die, and of her own
lover, Matteo, in peril of capture and death. What, then, if this
man were a very miracle of male beauty? Was he not the enemy of her
race? Did he not seek Matteo's life? Had he not set that foul hound
of his to track Matteo down.</p>
<p>Upon the unuttered answer to those unuttered questions she
braced herself, steeled her resolve and held out the tube she
carried.</p>
<p>'It is all set down here, Magnificent, in this petition.'</p>
<p>He moved his horse forward some paces from amid his attendant
courtiers, and without haste put forth his gauntleted hand to
receive the thing she proffered. He balanced it in his palm a
moment, as if weighing it, considering. It was a hollow can, sealed
at both ends. A faint smile moved his lips under cover of his
auburn beard.</p>
<p>'Here are great precautions,' was his gentle comment, and his
eyes stabbed her with questions.</p>
<p>'I would not have it polluted on its way to your august hands,'
she explained. His smile broadened. He inclined his head as if to
acknowledge the courtliness of her speech. Then his glance went
beyond her and rested on the scared and savage Pantaleone.</p>
<p>'What fellow is that who is skulking there behind you?' said he.
'You there!' he called. 'Olà! Approach!'</p>
<p>Pantaleone gave a nervous hitch to his reins and walked his
horse forward. His bronzed face was pallid, his glance furtive and
uneasy; indeed, extreme uneasiness was writ large in every line of
him.</p>
<p>Cesare's brows were faintly raised. 'Why, Messer Pantaleone!' he
cried. 'You are well returned, and most opportunely. Here, break me
these seals and read me the parchment this tube contains.'</p>
<p>There was a sudden stir of interest in the gay flock of
attendants, a movement of horses and a craning of necks which
quickened when Madonna Fulvia intervened.</p>
<p>'No, no, Magnificent!' Her voice was sharp with a sudden
anxiety. 'It is for your eyes alone.'</p>
<p>He pondered her white face until she felt as she would faint
under his regard, such was the terror with which it was beginning
to inspire her. He smiled with a sweetness as ineffable as it was
terrible and he addressed her in his silkiest accents.</p>
<p>'Since beholding you, Madonna, my eyes are something dazzled. I
must borrow Ser Pantaleone's, there, and be content to employ my
ears.' Then to Pantaleone on a sudden note of sharp command: 'Come,
sir,' he said, 'we wait.'</p>
<p>Pantaleone a little dazed by his terror took the thing in his
shaking hands, and not daring to demur or show hesitation, broke
one of the seals with clumsy fumbling fingers. A silken cord
protruded from the tube. He seized it to pull forth the parchment,
then with a sharp exclamation he drew back his hand as if he had
been stung&mdash;as indeed he had been. There was a speck of blood
on his thumb and another on his fore-finger.</p>
<p>Madonna Fulvia shot a fearful glance at Valentinois. She saw
here the miscarriage of her crafty plan, through the one factor
which she had left out of consideration&mdash;the circumstance that
Cesare Borgia living and moving in an environment of treachery,
amid foes both secret and avowed, took no chances of falling a
victim either to their force or their guile. She had not reckoned
that he would appoint Pantaleone in this matter to an office akin
to that filled at his table by the venom-taster.</p>
<p>'Come, come,' the Duke was admonishing the hesitating
Pantaleone, more sharply now. 'Are we to wait here in the cold all
day? The petition, man!'</p>
<p>Desperately Pantaleone now grasped the cord, taking care this
time to avoid the thorn that accident or design&mdash;and he did
not greatly care which, since he counted himself lost in any
case&mdash;had lodged in the strands of the silk. He drew forth a
cylinder of parchment, let fall the cane that had contained it,
unrolled the petition with shaking hands, and studied it awhile,
his brow wrinkled by the effort, for he was an indifferent
scholar.</p>
<p>'Well, sir? Will you read?'</p>
<p>Precipitately he responded to that command, and fell to reading
aloud, his voice hoarse.</p>
<p>'Magnificent&mdash;By these present I make appeal to you for
justice against one who has proved as treacherous to you in the
performance of the task to which you set him as was treacherous
that task itself...'</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly, looking up with the wild eyes of a hunted
thing.</p>
<p>'It...it is not true!' he protested, faltering. 'I...'</p>
<p>'Who bade you judge?' Cesare asked. 'I bade you read; no more.
Read on, then. Should it prove to concern you your answer to it can
follow.'</p>
<p>Under the suasion of that imperious will, Pantaleone bent his
eyes to the parchment again, and pursued his reading.</p>
<p>'...Believing that Matteo Orsini whom he was bidden to arrest is
in hiding at Pievano, he has consented to connive at his escape and
thus betray your trust in him upon the condition that I become his
wife and my dowry his possession.'</p>
<p>Again he broke off. 'By the Eyes of God, it is false! As false
as hell!' he cried, a sob of agony breaking his voice.</p>
<p>'Read on!' The Duke's voice and mien were alike terrible.
Dominated once more, Pantaleone returned yet again to the
parchment.</p>
<p>'...Escape may or may not be for Matteo, but at least there can
be no escape for you who read, by the time you have read thus far.
We have another guest at Pievano in our lazar-house there&mdash;the
small-pox. And these present have lain an hour upon the breast of
one who is dying of it, and...'</p>
<p>On a sudden outcry of terror Pantaleone brought his reading
abruptly to an end. The plague-laden parchment floated from his
hands that were suddenly turned limp. It reached the ground, and
there was a sudden alarmed movement on all sides to back away
beyond the radius of its venom, beyond the danger of the dread
scourge that it exuded.</p>
<p>Dully through Pantaleone's benumbed wits the realization thrust
itself that the thorn in the silk had been no accident. It had been
set there of intent, so that it might open a way by which the
terrible infection should travel the more swiftly and surely into
the reader's veins. He knew himself for a doomed man, one who might
count himself under sentence of death, since the chances of winning
alive through an attack of that pestilence were so slight as to be
almost negligible. Ashen-faced he stared straight before him, what
time indignation and horror found voice on every side, and
continued clamant until the Duke raised an imperious hand to demand
silence.</p>
<p>He alone remained unmoved, or at least showed no outward sign of
such anger as he may have felt. When next he addressed the
white-faced lady, who had made this desperate attempt upon his
life, his voice was as smooth and silken as it had been before, his
returning smile as sweet. And perhaps because of that the doom he
pronounced was the more awful.</p>
<p>'Of course,' he said, 'since Ser Pantaleone has fulfilled his
part of the bargain, you, Madonna, will now fulfil yours. You will
wed him as you undertook.'</p>
<p>Wide-eyed, she stared, and it was a long moment ere she
understood the poetic justice that he meted out to her. When at
last her voice came it came in a hoarse cry of horror.</p>
<p>'Wed him? Wed him! He is infected...'</p>
<p>'With your venom,' Cesare cut in crisply. And he continued
calmly as one reasoning with a wayward child: 'It is your duty to
yourself and him. You are in honour bound by your compact. The poor
fellow could not foresee all this. You had not made him privy to
you plans.'</p>
<p>He was mocking her. She perceived it, and rage surged through
her at the ruthless cruelty of it. She had ever heard that he was
pitiless, but in no imagining of hers could she ever have conceived
a pitilessness to compare with this. Her sudden surge of anger
heartened her a little, yet it lent her no words in which to answer
him, for in truth he was unanswerable&mdash;his justice ever was,
wherefore men hated him the more.</p>
<p>'You called to me for justice, Madonna,' he reminded her. 'Thus
you receive it. It is complete, I think. I hope it satisfies
you.'</p>
<p>Her anger shivered itself unuttered against that iron dominance
of his. Before it her spirit left her utterly, her high courage
ebbed like water, and she became again the prey of fear and
horror.</p>
<p>'Oh, not that! not that!' she cried to him. 'Mercy! Mercy! as
you would hope for mercy in your need, have mercy on me now.' He
looked sardonically at Ser Pantaleone, who sat his horse, benumbed
in body and in brain.</p>
<p>'Madonna Fulvia does not flatter you, Pantaleone,' said he. 'She
has little fancy for you as a bridegroom, it appears. Yet, fool,
you believed her when she promised to take you to husband. You
believed her! Ha! What was it Fra Serafino said of you?' He fell
thoughtful. 'I remember! He found you too full in the lips to be
trusted with a woman. He knows his world, Fra Serafino. A cloister
is a good coign of observation. So you succumbed to her promises!
But be comforted. She shall fulfil them, where she thought to cheat
you. She shall take you to that white breast of hers&mdash;you and
the plague you carry with you.'</p>
<p>'Oh, God!' she panted. 'Will you wed me to death?'</p>
<p>'Is it possible,' he wondered, 'that you can find death more
repulsive than Pantaleone? Yet consider,' he begged her, reasoning
dispassionately, 'that I do naught by you that you would not have
done by me.' He began with infinite caution to peel off the heavy
gauntlet of buffalo hide with which he had handled that
death-dealing tube. 'After all,' he resumed, 'if to keep your word
is beyond measure odious to you&mdash;a family trait with you,
Madonna, as I have cause to know&mdash;I may show you the way to
escape its consequences.'</p>
<p>She looked at him, but there was no hope in her glance.</p>
<p>'You mock me!' she cried.</p>
<p>'Not so. There is a way that some would account to be consistent
with honour. Cancel the bargain that you made with him, and thus
cancel the obligation to fulfil your part and to submit to his
embrace.'</p>
<p>'Cancel it? How cancel it?' she asked.</p>
<p>'Is it not plain? By surrendering Matteo Orsini to me. Deliver
him up to me this day, and the night shall be free from nuptials
that are distasteful to you.'</p>
<p>She understood at once the satanic subtlety of this man; she saw
how far removed he was from any petty vengeance such as she had
suspected him to be gratifying: she was but an insignificant pawn
in the deep game he played; her feelings were to him no more than
the means to the one end of which never for an instant had he lost
sight&mdash;the capture of Matteo Orsini. That was all that
mattered to him, and he was not to be turned aside by any
considerations of anger towards herself. He had terrified her with
the threat of this unutterable marriage, simply that he might
render her pliant to his will, ready to pay any price of treachery
to escape that ghastly fate.</p>
<p>'Deliver him up to you?' she said, and it was her turn to smile
at last, but with infinitely bitter scorn.</p>
<p>'Could aught be easier?' he asked. 'There is no need to tell me
even where he lurks. I do not ask you to betray him, or do aught
that would hurt your tender Orsini sensibilities.' His sarcasm was
a sword of fire. 'You need but to send him word of the plight into
which your essay in poisoning has landed you. That is all. As he is
a man, he must come hither to ransom you from the consequences of
your deed. Let him come before nightfall, or else&mdash;' he
shrugged, flung his gauntlets down into the mud, and nodded his
head towards the stricken Pantaleone&mdash;'you keep your bargain;
you pay the price agreed upon for his escape, and myself I shall
provide the nuptial banquet.'</p>
<p>She looked at him with a deep malignity aroused by his own
relentlessness and by the hateful suavity in which he cloaked it.
And then her wits roused themselves to do battle with his own. She
saw how subtlety might yet defeat subtlety. And as the idea crept
into her fevered mind, the blood came slowly back into her livid
cheeks, her glance grew bold and resolute as it met his own.</p>
<p>'Be it so,' she said. 'You leave me no choice, Magnificent.' Her
voice came harsh and something mocking. 'It shall be as you desire.
I will send my servant to him now.'</p>
<p>He gave her a long, searching glance which at first was grave
and doubting, and ended by becoming almost contemptuous. He made a
sign to his cavaliers.</p>
<p>'Let us on, sirs. Here is no more to do.' But he stooped from
his saddle to issue an order in an undertone to Della Volpe who
throughout had stood beside him. Then flicking his horse with the
slight whip which he carried, he moved on across the square, his
fluttering attendants with him. He knew this Orsini brood. They
were all the same. Bold to devise, but craven to execute; their
brains were stouter than their hearts. Their stiffness crumpled at
the touch.</p>
<h3>VIII</h3>
<p>Erect and stiff upon her horse sat Madonna Fulvia, her eyes
following the Duke as he rode away across the square, to vanish
down the street that opened out of it. She remained thus, bemused,
half-dazed, indifferent to the gaping crowd that by now surrounded
her, but keeping its distance out of respect for the disease with
which Pantaleone was accounted laden.</p>
<p>She was roused at length by a groom dressed in black with a bull
wrought in red upon the breast of his doublet, who stepped forward
to take her reins, whilst at the same time Della Volpe addressed
her, his tone respectful but his single eye contemptuous.</p>
<p>'Madonna,' he said, 'I pray you go with us. I have my lord's
commands for your entertainment.'</p>
<p>She looked at him, sneering at first at the euphemism he had
employed by which to convey to her that she was a prisoner. But
something in that veteran's rugged face struck the sneer from her
lips. Two things she read in that countenance: the first, that he
was honest; the second, that he contemned her action.</p>
<p>Her glance grew troubled, and it fell away from him. 'Do you
lead the way then, sir,' she said. 'My equerry here accompanies me,
I think.' And she indicated Mario, who sat his horse rigidly behind
her, a dumb anguish in his dark eyes.</p>
<p>'Naturally, Madonna, since he is to be your messenger. Forward,
Giasone,' he commanded, and upon that, the groom leading her horse,
Della Volpe striding grimly beside her and Mario riding as grimly
in her wake, she moved forward towards the Communal Palace whither
by Cesare's orders they were taking her.</p>
<p>As for the wretched Pantaleone, she scarce bestowed another
thought upon him. He had been no more than a pawn in this game of
hers, even as she was become one now in the deeper game of the
Duke's. He had served his miserable turn, though not quite as she
had intended. In view of the resolve she had taken, it was unlikely
that she would be troubled with him again, she thought.</p>
<p>She had observed, though with but faint interest, that a
half-dozen arbalisters had charge of him. These men, under the
command of an antient, showed no relish for their task of
apprehending one who was so armed that without raising a finger he
could fling death about him. Accordingly they kept their distance.
They made a wide ring about their prisoner, each with a quarrel
laid to his arbalest, and thus they urged him away, threatening to
shoot him if he were disobedient.</p>
<p>When at last he had been removed in this fashion, a man in the
Borgia livery came forward with a flaming torch to within a couple
of yards of the pestilential parchment that still lay where it had
fallen. Thence he flung his torch upon it, nor went to recover it
again. Torch and plague-laden parchment were consumed together, in
spite of which, so runs the story, the good folk of Città della
Pieve went wide of the spot for days thereafter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Madonna Fulvia had been conducted to the Communale,
and found herself housed in a long low-ceilinged chamber of the
mezzanine of the old palace, an austere room in the matter of
equipment, for Città della Pieve was a modest township that had not
kept pace with the luxurious development of the great Italian
States.</p>
<p>A guard was placed outside the door, and another was set to pace
beneath her windows; but at least she was given the freedom of that
spacious chamber, and of course Mario was admitted to her presence,
since he was to be her messenger to Matteo Orsini. The Duke had
judged it well that it should be so, since to the testimony of such
letters as she might write Mario would add the confirmation of his
own evidence of a fact which might be disbelieved if related by
another.</p>
<p>Alone with his mistress, this frail child whom he had known from
her cradle, the old servant now broke down utterly. His grimness
deserted him utterly, and the tears rolled down his ghastly
furrowed face.</p>
<p>'Madonna mine! Madonna mine!' he sobbed brokenly, and held out
his arms as if he would have taken her to them, paternally to
comfort her. 'I warned you. I told you here was no work for such
gentleness as yours. I implored you to let me do this thing in your
stead. What do I matter? I am old; my life has reached its evening;
my loss of a few days more would be nobody's gain. But you...O God
of Pity!'</p>
<p>'Calm, Mario! Be calm,' she bade him gently.</p>
<p>'Calm?' he cried. 'Can I be calm when before you lies the choice
between betrayal and death, and, Gesù! such a death. Had I carried
an arbalest I should have put a bolt through his devil's heart when
he pronounced your doom; the fiend, the monster!'</p>
<p>'A beautiful devil he is,' she said. Then she dropped her voice.
'Mario!' she called him softly. Her eyes flashed to the door, then
she drew still farther from it, over to the window overlooking the
square, beckoning him to follow. He went silently, staring,
impressed by the mystery of her bearing.</p>
<p>By the window, in lowered murmuring accents she addressed
him.</p>
<p>'There may yet be a way out of this,' she said. 'You shall bear
no letters, because you will need none. Listen now.' And she gave
him her commands.</p>
<p>By the time she had done he was staring at her, his jaw fallen.
Then he stirred himself out of his amazement. He broke into
protests that she was but making her ruin doubly certain; he sought
to dissuade her, reminded her that it was through a disregard of
his counsels that she came into her present ghastly pass, and
besought her not again to disregard them.</p>
<p>But in her headstrong way she remained unmoved, her resolve a
rock upon which the torment of his loving eloquence broke and was
dissipated. And so in the end she had her way with him against his
better judgement, even as last night. That there might be no
mistake she repeated all to him in brief at parting.</p>
<p>'And to my lord? What shall I say to my lord?' he asked.</p>
<p>'As little as you can, and nothing to alarm him.'</p>
<p>'I am to lie, then.'</p>
<p>'Even that if need be, out of charity to him.'</p>
<p>He departed at last, and throughout the long afternoon she sat
alone in that room of the mezzanine, save for one interruption when
a couple of slender vermilion striplings of the Duke's household
brought her food and wine in golden vessels upon salvers of beaten
gold.</p>
<p>She drank a little of the wine, but though she had not eaten
since leaving Pievano early that morning, the suffocation of
suspense was upon her and she refused all food.</p>
<p>She sat by the window, and towards evening she saw the Duke
returning with his gay cavalcade. Later, as the twilight was
deepening, the two vermilion pages returned to bid her in the
Duke's name to the supper that was spread below. She excused
herself. But the pages were gently insistent.</p>
<p>'It is his potency's wish,' one of them informed her, in a tone
that quietly implied that what his potency wished none might
withstand.</p>
<p>Perceiving not only the uselessness of further denial, but,
further, that her very presence below might advance the thing she
had set herself to do, she rose and signed to the pages to lead the
way. In the corridor another pair awaited her, each bearing a
lighted taper, who went on ahead. In this ceremonious fashion was
she conducted below to the great hall, where a courtly crowd of
cavaliers and ladies were assembled, making her instantly
conscious&mdash;very woman that she was&mdash;of her own plain and
dusty raiment, so out of place amid all this glittering
splendour.</p>
<p>The Duke himself, tall and graceful in a suit of
sulphur-coloured silk with silver bands at throat and waist,
advanced to the foot of the stairs to receive her, bowing to her
with the deference he might have used to a princess. By the hand,
which she did not dream of denying him, he led her through the
throng to the double doors that were thrown open upon an inner
room. Here long tables were set for supper upon a dais that formed
the three sides of a parallelogram.</p>
<p>At the table's head, in the middle of the short upper limb, he
took his seat with her beside him, whilst those who had trooped in
after them found for themselves the places that had been allotted
them. It was as if the company had but awaited the arrival of
herself as of an honoured guest, and the vengeful mockery of it
stabbed her to the soul. Yet she strove that naught of this should
appear, and she succeeded. White-faced she sat between Valentinois
and the portly Capello, Orator of Venice, braving the curious
glances that were flashed towards her from every side.</p>
<p>That room of the Communale, which in normal times was bare and
cheerless as a barn, had been transmogrified under the deft hands
of Cesare's familiars until none who knew its ordinary appearance
could now have recognized it. You might have supposed yourself in
one of the chambers of the Vatican. The walls were hung with costly
arras, Byzantine carpets had been spread upon the stone floor, and
the tables themselves gleamed and flashed with broidered naperies,
vessels of gold and silver, costly crystal and massive candlesticks
in which candles of painted and scented wax were burning. Add to
this that gorgeous company in silk and velvet, in cloth of gold and
silver, in ermines and miniver, the women in gem-encrusted bodices
and jewelled hair-nets, the flock of splendidly liveried servants
below the dais, the cloud of fluttering pages, and you will
understand how Madonna Fulvia reared far from the world of courts
in the claustral seclusion of Pievano, was dazzled by the
spectacle.</p>
<p>From a fretted gallery above the doorway came a sound of lutes,
archlutes and viols, and under cover of the music&mdash;his voice
so melodious that it almost seemed to sing to it&mdash;the Duke
addressed her.</p>
<p>'I rejoice for you, Madonna,' he said, 'that here is spread no
nuptial feast.'</p>
<p>She looked at him, and shivered slightly as she turned away
again.</p>
<p>'It would break my heart,' he pursued on that murmuring,
caressing note of his that lent his voice a wooing quality, 'it
would break my heart to see so much beauty delivered into the arms
of foul infection. Hence do I fervently pray that Matteo Orsini
comes tonight.'</p>
<p>'And for no other reason?' she asked him scornfully, stung by
what seemed to her such stark hypocrisy.</p>
<p>He smiled, his beautiful sombre eyes enveloping her white face
in their regard. 'I confess the other,' he admitted, 'but I swear
as I am living man and worship all things lovely, the reason that I
gave weighs the heavier.' He sighed. 'It is to save you that I pray
Matteo Orsini may come tonight.'</p>
<p>'He will come,' she answered him. 'Have no doubt of that.'</p>
<p>'He owes no less to his manhood,' he said quietly. Then turned
his attention to more immediate matter. 'You do not eat,' he
reproved her.</p>
<p>'I should choke, I think,' she answered frankly.</p>
<p>'A cup of wine at least,' he urged, and signed to a cellarer who
bore a gold vessel of soft Puglia wine. But, seeing her gesture of
refusal, he put forth a hand to stay the servant's pouring. 'Wait,'
he said, and beckoned a page to him. 'A moss-agate cup for Madonna
Fulvia, here,' he bade the stripling, and the page vanished upon
his errand.</p>
<p>Madonna's lip curled a little. 'There is no need for the
precaution,' she said&mdash;for moss-agate cups were said to burst
if poison touched them&mdash;'I neither suspect venom nor do I fear
it.'</p>
<p>'So much I might have known,' he answered, 'since you have
displayed yourself so subtly learned in the uses of it.'</p>
<p>He spoke quietly and gravely, but at the words she felt herself
go hot and cold at once. A scarlet wave suffused her face, then
ebbed, to leave it deathly pale. His words made her perhaps realize
that she had no just cause for grievance; she was a poisoner caught
<i>flagrante</i>, and the steely treatment he meted out to her in
his silken fashion was no more than her desert.</p>
<p>Back came the page with the gleaming moss-agate cup, which he
set down before her. The waiting cellarer brimmed it at a sign from
him, and his glance now inviting her she drank to steady her sudden
weakness.</p>
<p>But the meats they placed before her continued unheeded, nor did
she thereafter heed the Duke when he leaned aside to mock her still
with that dread gentleness of his. Her staring eyes were set
expectantly upon the doors at the room's end. It waxed late, and
her impatience mounted. Why did they not come, and thus put an end
to the unbearable strain of suspense that racked her very soul?</p>
<p>Came pages now with silver basins, ewers, and napkins. Gallants
and ladies dipped their hands and washed their fingers against the
serving of the sweetmeats, and then without warning&mdash;but
obeying, no doubt, the orders that the Duke had left&mdash;those
portals upon which Madonna's eyes had so long been fastened swung
open, and between two men-at arms in steel she beheld her
clay-faced equerry, the faithful Mario, haggard and dust-stained,
returned at last.</p>
<p>The hum of conversation sank down and was stilled as the sturdy
fellow advanced up the long room between the tables and came, still
flanked by his guards, to stand immediately before the Duke. Not to
the Duke, however, but to Madonna Fulvia did he address himself
when at length he spoke.</p>
<p>'Madonna, I have done your bidding. I have brought Ser
Matteo.'</p>
<p>A silence followed and a pause, ended at last by Cesare's short
laugh.</p>
<p>'Body of God! Did he need bringing?'</p>
<p>'He did, my lord.'</p>
<p>The Duke's glance swept over the noble company. 'You hear,' he
called to them, raising his voice. 'You perceive the lofty spirit
of these Orsini. An Orsini must needs be brought to ransom his
mistress and kinswoman from the fate decreed her.' He turned to the
equerry. 'Fetch him hither,' he said shortly, with a wave of his
fine hand.</p>
<p>But Mario was slow to obey. Not upon the Duke but upon Madonna
were his eyes set, as if awaiting her confirmation of that command.
She nodded, whereupon he turned and strode down the room again upon
his errand and so out.</p>
<p>The doors closed after him, but the silence continued. No man or
woman there but felt the oppression of the impending drama, but
awaited in suspense the climax and conclusion that were close at
hand. The very minstrels in the gallery had ceased their music, and
not a sound disturbed the general brooding hush.</p>
<p>Cesare leaned back in his high gilded chair, his slender fingers
toying delicately with the strands of his auburn beard, his
narrowed eyes glancing aslant at Madonna Fulvia. He found her
manner very odd. It contained some quality that intrigued him, and
eluded his miraculous penetration.</p>
<p>She sat there with ashen face and wide, staring eyes; so might a
corpse have sat, and a corpse you might have deemed her but for the
convulsive heave of her slight bosom.</p>
<p>And then a sound of voices beyond the door&mdash;of voices
raised in sudden altercation&mdash;broke upon the general
expectancy.</p>
<p>'You cannot enter!' came a gruff shout. 'You cannot take...'</p>
<p>And then they heard Mario's voice, harsh, vibrant and
compelling, interrupting and overbearing the objector.</p>
<p>'Did you not hear the Duke's express commands that I should bear
Matteo Orsini to him? I have Matteo Orsini here, and I but obey his
potency's commands. Out of my way, then.'</p>
<p>But other voices broke in upon him, all speaking together so
that they made no more than a confused and bawling chorus whose
purport was not to be discerned.</p>
<p>Suddenly Cesare rose in his place, his eyes flaming. 'What's
this?' he cried, 'By the Host! am I kept waiting? Set me wide those
doors!'</p>
<p>There was a scurry of lackeys to obey that imperious voice. The
Duke sank back into his chair as the doors were violently pulled
open. Beyond it a line of a half-dozen men-at-arms made a screen
that concealed whatever lay behind them.</p>
<p>'My lord...' began one of these, a grizzled antient, raising his
hand in appeal.</p>
<p>But Cesare let him get no further. His clenched hand descended
violently upon the table. 'Stand back, I say, and let him
enter.'</p>
<p>Instantly that line of steel-clad men melted and vanished, and
where it had been stood Mario now. He paused a moment on the
threshold, his face set and grim. Then he stalked forward up the
long room again between the tables. But no one heeded him. Every
eye was fixed in amazed and uncomprehending horror upon that which
followed after him.</p>
<p>Came four brothers of the Misericordia in black, funereal
habits, their heads cowled, their eyes gleaming faintly from the
eyeholes cut in their shapeless visors. Among them they carried a
bier, whose trappings of black velvet edged with silver swept the
ground as they solemnly advanced.</p>
<p>They were midway up that room before the company broke from the
spell of horror which this grim spectacle had laid upon it. A loud
outcry seemed to burst from every throat at once. Then the Duke
leapt to his feet, and the whole company with him, and in the
sudden stir and confusion none observed that Madonna Fulvia left
her place at the Duke's side.</p>
<p>The bearers halted and set down their ghastly burden. Mario
stood slightly aside, lest his body should screen the bier from the
eyes of the Duke.</p>
<p>'What's this?' his potency demanded, anger ringing in his voice.
'What jest is this you dare to put upon me?' And as he spoke he
swung aside to where Madonna Fulvia had been, then, finding her
place now vacant, his flaming eyes swept round in quest of her, and
discovered her at last standing there beside the bier.</p>
<p>'No jest, Magnificent,' she answered him, her head thrown back,
a smile of bitter, tragic triumph on her white face. 'Faithful and
utter compliance with your behest&mdash;no more. You commanded that
Matteo Orsini should be delivered into your hands. Provided I did
that you would release me of my compact to wed your jackal
Pantaleone degli Uberti. I hold you to your word, my lord. I have
done my part. Matteo Orsini is here.' And she flung an arm out and
downwards to indicate the bier.</p>
<p>He stared at her, his eyes narrowing, oddly out of countenance
for one habitually so calm, so master of every circumstance.</p>
<p>'Here?' he questioned, and added the further
question&mdash;'Dead?'</p>
<p>For answer she stooped and swept the velvet pall aside, laying
bare the coffin underneath. That done she faced him again, defiance
in her every slender line, a ghastly smile on her pale lips.</p>
<p>'Bid your guards hack off the lid that you may assure yourself
'tis he. I promise you he will offer no resistance now.'</p>
<p>Considering him, she took satisfaction in the perception that at
last she had wiped that hateful, gently mocking smile from his
face. He was scowling upon her, his eyes ablaze with such a passion
as no man in all Italy would willingly have confronted. His hands,
resting upon the table before him, were clenched so that the
knuckles showed like knobs of marble.</p>
<p>The rest of them, the whole of that splendid company, was ranged
against the walls as far as possible from that hideous thing below.
In their minds, as in Cesare's, there stirred a memory of what had
befallen earlier that day&mdash;of that letter that had been
infected and of the manner of that infection&mdash;and a suspicion
of what was yet to follow began to form in the thoughts of all.</p>
<p>Thus for a spell of awful silence, then Cesare's voice rasped
out a question harshly&mdash;a question that voiced in part that
general and terrible suspicion.'</p>
<p>'How died he?'</p>
<p>Came like a thunderbolt her answer, shrilly delivered on a high
note of fierce exaltation&mdash;'He died of the smallpox
yesternight. Hack off the lid,' she added. 'Hack off the lid, and
take him.'</p>
<p>But that last mocking invitation which she hurled at the Duke
was lost in the sudden uproar in the noise of the wild stampede
that followed her announcement. Mad with fear, men who had shown
themselves fearless upon a field of stricken battle turned this way
and that, seeking a way out. Cursing, they hurled themselves
against the long windows that opened upon the little claustral
garden of the Communale, and screaming, fainting women crowded
after them to avail themselves of this shortest way out that was
being forced open.</p>
<p>It would have needed more even than the presence of that
terrible duke to have restrained them in their wild panic, in their
mad frenzy to breathe the clean cold air, to quit this tainted
atmosphere, to fly this hideous plague-spot. Nor did Cesare make
any effort to delay their flight.</p>
<p>With shivering of glass and crashing of splintered timbers those
long window-doors were swept away. Out of the room headlong, as a
river that has burst its dam, surged that courtly, terror-stricken
mob; into it rushed the pure, keen air of the January night.</p>
<p>Cesare alone, at his place beyond the board, in the flickering
light of wind-blown, guttering candles, remained even after the
last lackey had fled, conquered by his panic. Indomitable, the Duke
stood there to face the woman who dared to bring a plague-ridden
corpse to set at naught his authority and make a mock of his
power.</p>
<p>'Well?' she asked him, and her laugh made him shudder, man of
iron though he was. 'Have you the courage to face Matteo Orsini
now? Or do you lack it still, for all that he is dead?'</p>
<p>'Living I never feared him,' he blazed out, unworthily it must
be confessed.</p>
<p>'Then you will not fear him dead,' said she, and turned fiercely
upon her equerry. 'Here, Mario, you who have had the scourge and
therefore need no longer fear it, prize off this lid. Give Matteo
room to strike even in death.'</p>
<p>But the Duke waited for no more. Panic took him, too; and he was
known to confess to it thereafter, adding that it was the only
occasion in all his life upon which he had been face to face with
fear, he who so often had looked death in the eyes without
quailing.</p>
<p>'Blood of God!' he cried, and on that fierce oath he sprang from
the table, and flung through the nearest window in the wake of his
vanished court. Outside they heard him shouting for his horse, and
they heard too the clamour of answering voices.</p>
<p>Within ten minutes he and his noble company were in the saddle,
scudding through the night away from Castel della Pieve and the
dread plague it harboured.</p>
<p>As that thunder of hoofs receded, Madonna Fulvia, who had
remained by the coffin with no word spoken, bade the men take up
their burden once more. Laden with it they passed out of that room,
all littered with the now unheeded treasures that had been
assembled in the Duke's honour. Madonna and Mario walked ahead, the
coffin was borne after them. They crossed the hall and quitted the
palace, none hindering, indeed all fleeing before their approach.
Horses were found for herself and Mario; the bearers came on foot
with their burden. Thus they took the road by the marshes back to
Pievano in the dark.</p>
<p>When they had put a league or so between themselves and Città
della Pieve, she spoke for the first time.</p>
<p>'How was it with Giuberti today, Mario?' she asked.</p>
<p>'He died at noon, Madonna,' was the answer. 'God be praised,
there is no other case of smallpox yet, and by His Grace there will
be none. Our precautions were well taken, and they will be to the
end. Colomba herself dug his grave and gave him burial deep in the
enclosed garden. The lazar-house was in flames when I left Pievano,
so that all source of infection may be destroyed, and Colomba
herself will set up a tent in the enclosure and abide there until
all danger of her carrying the scourge is overpast.'</p>
<p>'The good Colomba shall be rewarded, Mario. We are profoundly in
her debt.'</p>
<p>'A faithful soul,' Mario admitted. 'But there was no risk to
her, since like myself, she too has paid the price of
immunity.'</p>
<p>'That cannot lessen our gratitude,' she said. And then she
sighed. 'Poor Giuberti! God rest his loyal soul! A faithful servant
ever, he has served us even in death. Heaven has blessed us in the
matter of servants, Mario. There is yourself...'</p>
<p>'I? I am but a clod,' he interrupted. 'I had not the wit to
trust you today. Had you been dependent upon my service all must
have miscarried and Heaven knows what fatality had been the end of
this adventure.'</p>
<p>'Which reminds me,' said she, 'that these poor fellows are
unnecessarily laden. We have no pursuit to fear, and we shall make
the better speed if we ease them of their burden.' She drew rein as
she spoke, and Mario with her. 'Enough!' she called to those cowled
figures that swung along behind her. 'Empty it out.'</p>
<p>Obediently they set down the coffin, forced up the lid, tilted
it over, and rolled out the load of earth and stones that it
contained.</p>
<p>She laughed softly in the dark when this was done. But Mario
shuddered, bethinking him of the risk she had taken.</p>
<p>'God and His saints be thanked he did not dare to look,' he said
with fervour. 'He has a reputation for high courage, and I
feared...By the Host! how I feared!'</p>
<p>'Not more than I feared, Mario,' she confessed, 'but I also
hoped; and if the chance was a desperate one it was still the only
chance.'</p>
<p>At Pievano some hours later she found her father so racked with
anxiety by her continued absence and the circumstance that Mario
had come and gone again that afternoon that he had summoned the
fugitive Matteo Orsini from his hiding place to consult with him as
to what measures should be taken.</p>
<p>Her appearance ended their travail of spirit, and the sight of
them made an end of the fortitude that had so long upheld her. She
flung herself upon her lover's breast, panting and trembling.</p>
<p>'You may sleep quiet now of nights, Matteo mine,' she said. 'He
believes you dead, and fears you dead more than he could ever have
feared you living.' And on that she fainted in his arms, her
strength of body and of spirit alike exhausted.</p>
<p>And that, so far as I can discover, is the only instance in
which man or woman defeated the Duke of Valentinois in an encounter
of wits; nor does it lessen my high opinion of his penetration, for
it must surely be admitted that the dice were heavily cogged
against him, and that he fell a victim to a fraud rendered possible
by circumstances. There is also responsible for this failure the
fact that for once he did not choose his tool with that
discrimination which Macchiavelli enjoins upon princes. He
overlooked the significance of those excessively full lips of
Pantaleone's and left unheeded the warning Fra Serafino uttered on
the score of them. Or perhaps, on the other hand...But why
speculate? I have laid the facts before you, and you may draw your
own inferences.</p>
<p>As for Pantaleone, if he still interests you, he fared on the
whole perhaps better than he deserved, though that is purely a
matter of the point of view from which he is to be judged. For, as
the Lord Almerico's favourite philosopher has said, a man does not
choose the part he shall play in life, he simply plays the part
that is allotted to him.</p>
<p>He was entirely overlooked when Cesare with all his following
left Città della Pieve, and he was left there in the gaol into
which he had been flung until it should be ascertained whether he
was to be required as a bridegroom. Anon Cesare remembered him, and
was about to order him to be strangled when he learnt that the
fellow had developed the smallpox and had been, very properly,
taken to a lazar-house. It is recorded that upon hearing this the
Duke shuddered at the memory of his own escape, and was content to
leave the rascal to the fate that had overtaken him&mdash;perhaps
because he knew of no one who in the circumstances would undertake
to strangle him.</p>
<p>Pantaleone's lusty youth stood him in such good stead that he
made one of those rare recoveries from that pitiless scourge. But
he came forth into the world again broken in health and strength,
and no longer to be recognized for the same swaggering, arrogant
captain who had sought sanctuary on that January evening at
Pievano.</p>
<p>His career as a captain of fortune being ended, realizing that
he was a broken and useless man, he dragged himself wearily back to
the village of Laveno in the Bolognese, and stumbled one April
morning into Leocadia's wine-shop; there he flung himself upon the
charity and the ample bosom of the woman whom in prosperity he had
forsaken. And such is the ever-forgiving and generous nature of
your true woman that Leocadia put her arms about him and wept
silently in thanksgiving for his return, blessing the disease that
had made him weak and hideous since it had restored him to her.</p>
<p>Since it sorted well with his interest, I do not doubt that he
made an honest woman of her.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>THE VENETIAN</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>He who is great shall never lack for enemies. He has to reckon
first with lesser great ones, whose ambitions he thwarts by his own
success, outstripping and overshadowing them; and he has to reckon
further with those insignificant parasites of humanity who,
themselves utterly unproductive of aught that shall benefit their
race, destitute alike of the wit to conceive for themselves or the
energy and capacity to execute the conceptions of their betters,
writhe in the secret consciousness of their utter worthlessness and
spit the venom of their malice at him who has achieved renown. In
this they no more than obey the impulses of their paltry natures,
the dictates of their foolish narrow vanity. The greatness of
another wounds them in their own self-love. They readily become
detractors and defamers, conceiving that if in the public mind they
can pull down the object of their envy, they have lessened the gulf
between themselves and him. Fluent&mdash;if
undeceiving&mdash;liars, they go to work through the medium of that
their sole and very questionable gift. They lie of their own
prowess, importance and achievement, that thus they may puff
themselves up to an apparently greater stature, and they lie
maliciously and cruelly concerning the object of their envy,
belittling his attainments, slandering the object of their envy,
belittling his attainments, slandering him in his private and
public life, and smothering his repute in the slime of their foul
inventions.</p>
<p>By such signs shall you know them&mdash;for a fool is ever to be
known by those two qualities: his inordinate vanity and his
falsehood, which usually is no more than an expression of that
vanity. But his falsehood, being naturally of the measure of his
poor intelligence, deceives none but his own kind.</p>
<p>Such a thing was Messer Paolo Capello, Orator of the Most Serene
Republic, a servant chosen to forward the Venetian hatred of Cesare
Borgia. Venice watched the Duke's growing power in Italy with
ever-increasing dismay. She saw herself threatened by a serious
rival in the peninsula, by one indeed who might come to eclipse her
own resplendent glory, even if he did not encroach upon her
mainland territories of which indeed she was by no means sure. That
jealousy of hers distorted her judgement of him, for she permitted
herself judgement and applied to him the only canons that she knew,
as if men of genius are to be judged by the standards that govern
the lives of haberdashers and spice-merchants. Thus Venice became
Cesare's most crafty, implacable enemy in Italy, and an enemy for
whose hand no weapon was too vile.</p>
<p>Gladly would the Venetians have moved in arms against him, to
attempt to crush this man who snatched the Romagna from under their
covetous traders' eyes; but in view of the league with France they
dared not. Yet what they dared they did. They sought to disturb his
relations with King Louis, and failing there, they sought alliances
with other States to which normally they were hostile, and when
there again they failed, thanks to a guile more keen and
intelligent than their own, they had recourse to the common weapons
of the assassin and the slanderer.</p>
<p>For the latter task they had a ready tool in that ineffable and
worthless Messer Capello, sometime their Orator at the Vatican; for
the former, another of whom we shall hear more presently.</p>
<p>This Capello was of the slipperiness of all slimy things. And he
worked in the dark, burrowing underground and never affording the
Duke a plain reason that should have justified extreme measures
against the sacred person of an ambassador. How he came to escape
assassination in the early days of his infamous career I have never
understood. I look upon its omission as one of Cesare Borgia's few
really great blunders. A hired bravo with a dagger on some dark
night might have stemmed that source of foulness, leaving the name
of Cesare Borgia and of every member of his family less odious to
posterity.</p>
<p>When Giovanni Borgia, Duke of Gandia, was murdered in the
pursuit of one of his frivolous amours, and no murderer could be
discovered&mdash;though many possible ones were named, from his own
brother Gioffredo to Ascanio Sforza, the Cardinal
Vice-Chancellor&mdash;there came at last from Venice a year after
the deed the accusation unsupported by any single shred of evidence
that the deed of fratricide was Cesare's. When Pedro
Caldes&mdash;or Perrotto, as he was called&mdash;the Pope's
chamberlain, fell into the Tiber and was drowned, came from Venice
a lurid tale&mdash;supplied as we know from the fertile,
unscrupulous pen of Messer Capello&mdash;of how Cesare had stabbed
the wretch in the Pope's very arms; and although no man admittedly
had witnessed the deed, yet Messer Capello gave the most
circumstantial details, even to how the blood had spurted up into
the face of his Holiness. When the unfortunate Turkish prince, the
Sultan Djem, died of a colic at Naples, it is Capello who starts
the outrageous story that he was poisoned by Cesare, and again he
circulated the like calumny when the Cardinal Giovanni Borgia
succumbed to a fever in the course of a journey through Romagna.
And if this were all&mdash;or if all the calumny that Capello
invented had been concerned with no more than steel and
poison&mdash;we might be patient in our judgement of him. But there
was worse, far worse. There was indeed no dunghill of calumny too
foul to be exploited by him in the interests of the Most Serene.
His filthy pen grew fevered in the elaboration of the gossip that
he picked up in curial ante-chambers, and in marking out Cesare
Borgia for its victim, it yet spared no member of his family but
included all in the abominations it invented or magnified. Most of
them have passed into history where they may be read, but not
necessarily believed. I will not sully this fair sheet nor your
decent mind with their recapitulation.</p>
<p>Thus was it that Messer Paolo Capello served the Most Serene
Republic. But because his services, frenzied though they were,
seemed slow to bear the fruit which the Most Serene so ardently
desired, other and more direct methods than those of calumny were
resolved upon. The Venetians took this resolve in mid-October of
the year 1500 of the Incarnation and VIII of the Papacy of Roderigo
Borgia, who ruled from the Chair of St Peter as Alexander VI; and
what urged them to it was to see Pandolfo Malatesta, whom they had
protected, driven out of his tyranny of Rimini, and that tyranny of
his, which they had coveted, pass by right of conquest&mdash;based
upon certain legal papal rights&mdash;into the possession of Cesare
Borgia, further to swell his dominions and his might.</p>
<p>The Most Serene Republic conceived that the hour had come for
sharper measures than such as were afforded her by the scurrilous
gleanings and inventions of her Orator. As her agent in this
sinister affair she employed a patrician who held the interests of
Venice very dear; a man who was bold, resolute and resourceful, and
whose hatred of the Duke of Valentinois was notoriously so intense
as to seem an almost personal matter. This man&mdash;the Prince
Marcantonio Sinibaldi&mdash;she dispatched to Rimini as her
envoy-extraordinary for the express purpose, ostensibly, of
conveying her lying felicitations to the Duke upon his
conquest.</p>
<p>As if to emphasize the peaceful and friendly character of his
mission, Sinibaldi was accompanied by his princess, a very
beautiful and accomplished lady of the noble house of Alviano. The
pair made their appearance in Rimini surrounded by a pomp and
luxury of retinue that was extraordinary even for the pompous and
wealthy Republic which they represented.</p>
<p>The princess was borne in a horse-litter carried by two
milk-white Barbary jennets, whose embroidered trappings of crimson
velvet swept the ground. The litter itself was a gorgeous
construction, gilded and painted like a bride's coffer and hung
with curtains that were of cloth of gold, upon each of which was
woven in red the device of the winged lion of St Mark. About this
litter swarmed a host of pages, all of them lads of patrician
estate, in the livery of the Republic.</p>
<p>There were mounted Nubian swordsmen in magnificent barbaric
garments, very terrifying of aspect; there were some dozen turbaned
Moorish slaves on foot, and finally there was a company of a score
of arbalesters on horseback as a bodyguard of honour for the
splendid prince himself. The prince, a handsome, resplendent
figure, towered upon a magnificent charger with a groom trotting
afoot at either of his stirrups. After him came a group of his
personal familiars&mdash;his secretary, his venom-taster, his
chaplain and his almoner, which last flung handfuls of silver coins
at the mob to impress it with his master's munificence and to
excite its acclamations of his illustrious person.</p>
<p>The good folk of Rimini who were scarcely recovered from the
excitements of the pageantry of Cesare's State entry into the city
were dazzled and dazed again by a spectacle of so much
magnificence.</p>
<p>Sinibaldi was housed&mdash;and this by the contriving of our
friend Capello&mdash;in the palace of the Lord Ranieri, a sometime
member of the banished Malatesta's council, but none the less one
of those who had been loudest in welcoming the conqueror Cesare,
acclaiming him in a speech of surpassing eloquence as Rimini's
deliverer.</p>
<p>The Duke had not been deluded by these fine phrases. Far from
it, he was inspired by them to have a close watch set upon
Malatesta's sometime councillor. Neither was he at all deluded by
the no less fine phrases of felicitations addressed him on behalf
of the Most Serene by her envoy-extraordinary Sinibaldi. He knew
too much&mdash;for he had received superabundant proof&mdash;of
Venice's real attitude towards himself. He answered them with words
fully as graceful and fully as hollow. And when he learnt that,
under himself, Ranieri was to be Sinibaldi's host in Rimini, that
both these nimble phrase-makers were to lie under one roof, he bade
his secretary Agabito see to it that the vigilance under which that
palace was already kept should be increased.</p>
<p>To meet Sinibaldi it must be confessed that Ranieri&mdash;a
portly, florid gentleman with a bright and jovial blue eye, the
very antithesis in appearance to the conspirator of
tradition&mdash;had assembled an odd company. There was Francesco
d'Alviano, a younger brother of that famous soldier, Bartolomeo
d'Alviano, than whom it was notorious that the Duke had no more
implacable enemy; there was the young Galeazzo Sforza of Catignola,
bastard brother to Giovanni Sforza, the divorced husband of
Cesare's lovely sister Lucrezia, lately dispossessed by the Duke of
his tyranny of Pesaro; and there were four others, three
patricians, who are of little account, and lastly Pietro Corvo,
that notorious, plebian Forlivese scoundrel who under the name of
Corvinus Trismegistus had once to his undoing practised magic. In
spite of all that already he suffered by it he could not refrain
from thrusting himself into the affairs of the great and seeking to
control the destinies of princes.</p>
<p>Now no man knew better than the astute and watchful Duke of
Valentinois the art of discovering traitors. He did not wait for
them to reveal themselves by their actions&mdash;for he knew that
by then it might be too late to deal with them. He preferred to
unmask their conspiracies whilst they were maturing. And of all the
methods that he employed the one to which he trusted most, the one
which most often had done his work for him in secrecy and almost
independently of himself, was that of the decoy.</p>
<p>Suspecting&mdash;and with excellent grounds&mdash;that treason
was hatching in that gloomy palace of Ranieri's, overlooking the
Marecchia, he bade his secretary Agabito put it abroad through his
numerous agents that several of the Duke's prominent officers were
disaffected towards him. Particular stress was laid upon the
disaffection of an ambitious and able young captain named Angelo
Graziani, towards whom it was urged that the Duke had behaved with
marked injustice, so that this Graziani notoriously but awaited an
opportunity to be avenged.</p>
<p>This gossip spread with the speed of all vile rumours. It was
culled in the taverns by the Lord Ranieri's spies, who bore it
swiftly to their master. With Graziani's name was coupled that of
Ramiro de Lorqua, at present the Duke's governor of Cesena, and for
a while Ranieri and Sinibaldi hesitated between the two. In the end
their choice fell upon Graziani. De Lorqua was the more powerful
man and wielded the greater influence. But their needs did not
require so much. Graziani was now temporarily in command of the
Duke's own patrician bodyguard, and their plans were of such a
nature that it was precisely a man in that position who could
afford them the opportunity they sought. Moreover, the gossip
concerning Graziani was more positive than that which concerned De
Lorqua. There was even in the former case some independent evidence
to support the tale that was abroad.</p>
<p>The young captain himself was utterly unconscious alike of these
rumours and of the test to which his fidelity to the Duke was about
to be submitted. Therefore he was amazed when on the last day of
October, as Prince Sinibaldi's visit to Rimini was drawing to its
close, he found himself suddenly accosted by the Lord Ranieri with
a totally unexpected invitation.</p>
<p>Graziani was in the ducal ante-chamber of the Rocca at the time,
and Ranieri was departing after a brief audience with his Highness.
Our gentleman threaded his way through the courtly throng, straight
to the captain's side.</p>
<p>'Captain Graziani,' he said.</p>
<p>The captain, a tall, athletic fellow, whose plain raiment of
steel and leather detached him from his silken surroundings, bowed
stiffly.</p>
<p>'At your service, my lord,' he replied, addressing Ranieri thus
for the first time.</p>
<p>'Prince Sinibaldi, who is my exalted guest, has remarked you,'
he said, lowering his voice to a confidential tone. 'He does you
the honour to desire your better acquaintance. He has heard of you,
and has I think a proposal to make to you that should lead to your
rapid advancement.</p>
<p>Graziani taken thus by surprise flushed with gratified pride.
'But I am the Duke's servant,' he objected.</p>
<p>'A change may commend itself to you when you learn what is
offered,' replied Ranieri. 'The prince honours you with the request
that you wait upon him at my house at the first hour of night.'</p>
<p>A little dazzled and flustered by the invitation, Graziani was
surprised into accepting it. There could be no harm, no disloyalty
to his Duke, he reasoned in that brief moment of thought, in
hearing what might be this proposal. After all the exchange of
service was permissible in a soldier of fortune. He bowed his
acknowledgement.</p>
<p>'I will obey,' he said, whereupon with a nod and a smile Ranieri
went his ways.</p>
<p>It was only afterwards when Graziani came to consider the matter
more closely that suspicion and hesitation were aroused in him.
Ranieri had said that the prince had remarked him. How should that
have happened since, as he now reflected, he had never been in
Sinibaldi's presence? It was odd, he thought; and his thoughts,
having started upon such a train as this, made swift progress. He
knew enough of the politics of his day to be aware of the feelings
entertained for Cesare Borgia by all Venetians; and he was
sufficiently equipped with worldly wisdom to know that a man who,
like Ranieri, could fawn upon the Duke who had dethroned that
Malatesta in whose favour and confidence he had so lately stood,
was not a man to be trusted.</p>
<p>Thus you see Graziani's doubts becoming suspicions; and very
soon those suspicions grew to certainty. He scented treason in the
proposal that Sinibaldi was to make him. If he went, he would most
probably walk into a trap from which there might be no withdrawal;
for when traitors reveal themselves they cannot for their own
lives' sake spare the life of one who, being invited, refuses to
become a party to that treason. Already Graziani saw himself in
fancy with a hole in his heart, his limp body floating seaward down
the Marecchia on the ebbing tide. Ranieri's house, he bethought
him, was conveniently situated for such measures.</p>
<p>But if these forebodings urged him to forget his promise to wait
upon Prince Sinibaldi, yet ambition whispered to him that after all
he might be the loser through perceiving shadows where there was no
real substance. Venice was in need of condottieri; the Republic was
wealthy and paid her servants well; in her service the chances of
promotion might be more rapid than in Cesare Borgia's, since
already almost every captain of fortune in Italy was serving under
the banner of the Duke. It was possible that in this business there
might be no more than the Lord Ranieri had stated. He would go.
Only a coward would remain absent out of fears for which grounds
were not clearly apparent. But only a fool would neglect to take
his measures for retreat or rescue in case his suspicions should be
proved by the event well-founded.</p>
<p>Therefore when on the stroke of the first hour of night Captain
Graziani presented himself at the Ranieri Palace, he had ambushed a
half-score of men about the street under the command of his
faithful antient Barbo. To Barbo at parting he had given all the
orders necessary.</p>
<p>'If I am in difficulties or in danger I shall contrive to smash
a window. Take that for your signal, assemble your men, and break
into the house at once. Let one of your knaves go round and watch
the windows overlooking the Marecchia, in case I should be forced
to give the signal from that side.'</p>
<p>These measures taken he went to meet the Venetian envoy with an
easy mind.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The young condottiero's tread was firm and his face calm when
one of Sinibaldi's turbaned Moorish slaves, into whose care he had
been delivered by the lackey who admitted him, ushered him into the
long low room of the mezzanine where the Venetian awaited him.</p>
<p>He had deemed the circumstance of the Moorish slave in itself
suspicious; it seemed to argue that in this house of the Lord
Ranieri's the prince was something more than guest since his
servants did the offices of ushers. And now, as he stood on the
threshold blinking in the brilliant light of the chamber, and
perceived that in addition to the prince and the Lord Ranieri there
were six others present, he conceived it certain that his worst
suspicion would be here confirmed.</p>
<p>This room into which he now stepped, ran through the entire
depth of the house, so that its windows overlooked the street at
one end and the River Marecchia, near the Bridge of Augustus, at
the other. It had an air at once rich and gloomy; the walls were
hung with sombre tapestries, the carpets spread upon the floor of
wood mosaics were of a deep purple that was almost black, and amid
its sparse furnishings there was a deal of ebony looking the more
funereal by virtue of its ivory inlays. It was lighted by an
alabaster-globed lamp set high upon the ponderous overmantel and by
silver candle-branches on the long table in mid-apartment about
which the company was seated when Graziani entered. An enormous
fire was roaring on the hearth, for the weather had lately set in
raw and cold.</p>
<p>As the door was softly closed behind Graziani, and as he stood
adjusting his eyes to the strong light, the Lord Ranieri stepped
forward with purring words of welcome, too cordial from one in his
lordship's position to one in Graziani's. With these he conducted
the captain towards the table. From his seat at the head of it rose
a tall and very stately gentleman with a long olive countenance
that was rendered the longer by a brown pointed beard, who added a
welcome of his own to the welcome which the Lord Ranieri had
already uttered.</p>
<p>He was dressed all in black, but with a rare elegance, and upon
his breast flashed a medallion of diamonds worth a nobleman's
ransom. Graziani did not require to be told that this was Prince
Sinibaldi, the envoy-extraordinary of the Most Serene.</p>
<p>The condottiero bowed low, yet with a soldierly stiffness and a
certain aloofness in his bearing that he could not quite dissemble.
He bowed, indeed, as a swordsman bows to his adversary before
engaging, and his countenance remained grave and set.</p>
<p>Ranieri drew up a chair for him to the table at which the other
six remained seated, their twelve eyes intent upon the new-comer's
face. Graziani gave them back look for look, but of them all the
only one whose face he knew was Galeazzo Sforza of Catignola, whom
he had seen at Pesaro; for it was this Galeazzo himself who in his
brother's stead had surrendered the place to Cesare Borgia. The
captain's glance was next arrested by Pietro Corvo, the Forlivese
who once had practised magic in Urbino. The fellow detached from
this patrician group as he must, for that matter, detach from any
group in which he might chance to find himself. His face was as the
face of a corpse; it was yellow as wax, and his skin was as a skin
of parchment drawn tight across his prominent cheekbones, whence it
sagged into the hollow cheeks and fell in wrinkles about the lean
sinewy neck. His lank thinning hair had faded to the colour of
ashes; his lips were bloodless; indeed no part of his countenance
seemed alive save only the eyes, which glittered as if he had the
fever. He was repulsive beyond description, and no man who looked
on him for the first time could repress a shudder.</p>
<p>One hand only remained him&mdash;his left&mdash;which was as
yellow and gnarled as a hen's foot. Its fellow he had left in
Urbino together with his tongue, having been deprived of one and
the other by order of Cesare Borgia whom he had defamed. That
punishment was calculated to disable him from either writing or
uttering further slanders; but he was fast learning to overcome the
disabilities to which it had subjected him, and already he was
beginning to write with that claw-like left hand that remained to
him.</p>
<p>Well had it been for him had he confined himself to the practice
of magic under his imposing name of Corvinus Trismegistus. Being a
fertile-witted rogue he had thriven exceedingly at that rascally
trade, and might have continued to amass a fortune had he not
foolishly drawn upon himself by his incautious slanders the
attention of the Duke of Valentinois.</p>
<p>Having now no tongue left wherewith to beguile the credulous,
nor sufficient magic to grow a fresh one, his trade was ruined, and
his hatred of the man who had ruined it was virulent, the more
virulent no doubt since his expression of it had been temporarily
curtailed.</p>
<p>His fierce, glittering eyes fastened mistrustfully upon Graziani
as the young soldier took the chair that was offered him by his
host. He parted his bloodless lips to make a horrible croaking
sound that reminded Graziani of frogs on a hot night of summer,
whilst he accompanied it by gestures to the Venetian which the
captain did not attempt to understand.</p>
<p>The Lord Ranieri resumed his seat at the table's foot. At its
head the prince remained standing, and he pacified the mute by a
nod conveying to him the assurance that he was understood. Then
from the breast of his doublet, two buttons of which were
unfastened, the Venetian drew a small crucifix beautifully wrought
in ivory upon gold. Holding it between his graceful, tapering
fingers, he addressed the condottiero solemnly.</p>
<p>'When we shall have made known to you the reason for which we
have sought your presence here tonight, Messer Graziani,' said he,
'it shall be yours to determine whether you will join hands with
us, and lend us your aid in the undertaking which we have in mind.
Should you elect not to do so, be your reason what it may, you
shall be free to depart as you have come. But first you must make
solemn oath engaging yourself neither by word spoken or written,
nor yet by deed, to divulge aught to any man of what may be
revealed to you of our designs.'</p>
<p>The prince paused, and stood waiting. Graziani reared his young
head, and he could almost have laughed outright at this discovery
of how shrewd and just had been the suspicions that had assailed
him. He looked about him slowly, finding himself the goal of every
eye, and every countenance alive with a mistrust and hostility that
nothing could quiet short of that oath demanded of him.</p>
<p>It comforted him in that moment to think of Barbo and his knaves
waiting below in case they should be needed. If Graziani knew men
at all, he would be likely to need them very soon, he thought.</p>
<p>Sinibaldi leaned forward supporting himself upon his left hand,
whilst with his right he gently pushed the crucifix down the table
towards the captain.</p>
<p>'First upon that sacred symbol of Our Redeemer...' he was
beginning, when Graziani abruptly thrust back his chair and
rose.</p>
<p>He knew enough. Here for certain was a conspiracy against the
State or against the life of his lord the Duke of Valentinois. It
needed no more words to tell him that. He was neither spy nor
informer, yet if he heard more and then kept secret he would
himself be a party to their treason.</p>
<p>'My lord prince,' he said, 'here surely is some mistake. What
you may be about to propose to me I do not know. But I do
know&mdash;for it is abundantly plain&mdash;that it is no such
proposal as my Lord Ranieri had led me to expect.'</p>
<p>There was a savage incoherent growl from the mute, but the
others remained watchfully silent, waiting for the soldier to
proceed, since clearly he had not yet done.</p>
<p>'It is not my way,' he proceeded gravely, 'to thrust myself
blindly into any business, and make oath upon matters that are
unknown to me. Suffer me therefore to take my leave of you at once.
Sirs,' he included the entire company in his bow, 'a happy
night.'</p>
<p>He stepped back from the table clearly and firmly resolved upon
departure, and on the instant every man present was upon his feet
and every hand was upon a weapon. They were rendered desperate by
their realization of the mistake that had been made. That mistake
they must repair in the only way that was possible. Ranieri sprang
away from the foot of the table, and flung himself between the
soldier and the door, barring his exit.</p>
<p>Checked thus, Graziani looked at Sinibaldi, but the smile upon
the Venetian's saturnine countenance was not reassuring. It
occurred to the captain that the time had come to break a window as
a signal to Barbo, and he wondered would they prevent him from
reaching one. First, however, he made appeal to Ranieri who stood
directly in his way.</p>
<p>'My lord,' he said, and his voice was firm almost to the point
of haughtiness, 'I came hither in friendliness, bidden to your
house with no knowledge of what might await me. I trust to your
honour, my lord, to see that I depart in like case&mdash;in
friendliness, and with no knowledge of what is here toward.'</p>
<p>'No knowledge?' said Ranieri, and he laughed shortly. His
countenance had lost by now every trace of its habitual joviality.
'No knowledge, eh? But suspicions, no doubt, and these suspicions
you will voice...'</p>
<p>'Let him take the oath,' cried the clear young voice of Galeazzo
Sforza. 'Let him swear to keep silent upon...'</p>
<p>But the steely accents of Sinibaldi cut in sharply upon that
speech.</p>
<p>'Do you not see, Galeazzo, that we have misjudged our man? Is
not his temper plain?'</p>
<p>Graziani, however, confined his glance and his insistence to
Ranieri.</p>
<p>'My lord,' he said again, 'it lies upon your honour that I shall
go forth in safety. At your bidding...'</p>
<p>His keen ears caught a stealthy sound behind him, and he whipped
round sharply. Even as he turned Pietro Corvo, who had crept as
softly, leapt upon him, fierce as a rat, his dagger raised to
strike&mdash;intending thus to make an end. Before Graziani could
move to defend himself the blade had descended full upon his
breast. Encountering there the links of the shirt of mail he wore
beneath his quilted doublet&mdash;for he omitted no
precautions&mdash;it broke off at the hilt under the force that
drove it.</p>
<p>Then Graziani seized that wretched wisp of humanity by the
breast of his mean jacket, and dashed him violently across the
room. The mute hurtled into Alviano, who stood midway between the
table and one of the windows. Alviano, thrown off his balance by
the impact, staggered in his turn and reeled against an ebony
pedestal surmounted by a marble cupid. The cupid, thus dislodged,
went crashing through the casement into the street below.</p>
<p>Now this was more than Graziani had intended, but it was
certainly no more than he could have desired. The signal to Barbo
had been given, and no one present any the wiser. It heartened him.
He smiled grimly, whipped out his long sword, swung his cloak upon
his left arm, and rushed thus upon Ranieri, forced for the moment
to leave his back unguarded.</p>
<p>Ranieri, unprepared for the onslaught, and startled by its
suddenness, swung aside, leaving the captain a clear way. But
Graziani was not so mad as to attempt to open the door. He knew
well that whilst he paused to seize and raise the latch a
half-dozen blades would be through his back before the thing could
be accomplished. Instead, having reached the door, he swung round,
and setting his back to it, faced that murderous company as it
swooped down upon him with naked weapons.</p>
<p>Five men confronted him immediately. Behind them stood
Sinibaldi, his sword drawn against the need to use it, yet waiting
meanwhile, preferring that such work should be done by these
underlings of his.</p>
<p>Yet though they were five to one, Graziani's sudden turn to face
them, and his poised preparedness, gave them a moment's pause. In
that moment he reckoned up his chances. He found them slight but
not quite hopeless, since all that was incumbent on him was to ward
their blows and gain some instants until Barbo and his men could
come to his assistance.</p>
<p>Another moment and they had closed with him, their whirling
blades athirst for his life. He made the best defence that a man
could make against such an onslaught, and a wonderful defence it
was. He was well-trained in arms as in all bodily exercises, supple
of joint, quick of movement, long of limb and with muscles that
were all steel and whipcord&mdash;indeed a very pentathlos.</p>
<p>He warded as much with his cloaked arm as with his sword, but he
had no chance, nor for that matter any thought, of taking the
offensive in his turn. He knew that a lunge or thrust or cut at any
single one of them, even if successful, must leave an opening
through which he would be cut down ere he could make recovery. He
would attack when Barbo came, and he would see to it then that not
one of these cowardly assassins, of these dastardly traitors, was
left alive. Meanwhile he must be content to ward, praying God that
Barbo did not long delay.</p>
<p>For some moments fortune favoured him, and his shirt of mail
proved his best friend. Indeed it was not until Alviano's sword
blade was shivered in a powerful lunge that caught Graziani full in
the middle of the body, that those gentlemen realized that the
condottiero's head was the only part of him that was vulnerable. It
was Sinibaldi who told them so, shouting it fiercely as he
shouldered aside the now disarmed Alviano, and stepped into the
place from which he thrust him. With death in his eyes the prince
now led the attack upon that man who made so desperate a defence
without chance of breaking ground or lessening the number of his
assailants.</p>
<p>Suddenly Sinibaldi's blade licked in and out again with
lightning swiftness in a feint that culminated in a second thrust,
and Graziani felt his sword arm suddenly benumbed. To realize what
had happened and to readjust the matter was with the captain the
work of one single thought. He caught his sword in his left hand,
that so he might continue his defence, even as Sinibaldi by a turn
of the wrist made a cutting stroke at his bare head. Perforce
Graziani was slow to the parry; the fraction of a second lost in
transferring his sword to the left hand and the further
circumstance that his left arm was hampered by the cloak he had
wound about it, left too great an advantage with Sinibaldi. Yet
Graziani's blade, though too late to put the other's aside, was yet
in time to break the force of the blow as it descended. The edge
was deflected, but not enough. If it did not open his skull as was
intended, at least it dealt him a long slanting scalp-wound.</p>
<p>The condottiero felt the room rock and heave under his feet.
Then he dropped his sword, and leaning against the wall, whilst his
assailants checked to watch him, he very gently slithered down it
and sat huddled in a heap on the floor, the blood from his wound
streaming down over his face. Sinibaldi shortened his sword, intent
upon making quite sure of his victim by driving the steel through
his windpipe. But even as he was in the act of aiming the stroke,
he was suddenly arrested by the horrible, vehement outcry of the
mute, who had remained at the broken window, and by a thunder of
blows that fell simultaneously upon the door below accompanied by a
sudden call to open.</p>
<p>That sound smote terror into the conspirators. It aroused them
to a sense of what they were doing, and brought to their minds the
thought of Cesare Borgia's swift and relentless justice which
spared no man, patrician or plebeian. And so they stood limply
stricken, at gaze, their ears straining to listen, whilst below the
blows upon the door were repeated more vehemently than before.</p>
<p>Ranieri swore thickly and horribly: 'We are trapped,
betrayed!'</p>
<p>Uproar followed. The eight plotters looked this way and that, as
if seeking a way out, each gave counsels and asked questions in a
breath, none heeding none, until at last the mute having compelled
their attention by his excited croaks, showed them the road to
escape.</p>
<p>He crossed the length of the room at a run, and nimble as a cat,
he leapt upon a marble table that stood before the casement
overlooking the river, from which the house rose almost sheer. He
never so much as paused to open it. The acquaintance he had already
made with methods of Borgia justice so quickened his terrors to a
frenzy that he hurled himself bodily at the closed window, and
shivering it by the force of the impact went through it and down in
a shower of broken glass to the black icy waters below.</p>
<p>They followed him as sheep follow their bellwether. One after
another they leapt upon the marble table; and thence through the
gap he had made they plunged down into the river. Not one of them
had the wit in that breathless moment to pause to consider which
way the tide might be running. Had it chanced to have been upon the
ebb it must have swept them out to sea, and none of them would
further have troubled the destinies of Italy. Fortunately for them,
however, it was flowing; and so it bore them upwards towards the
Bridge of Augustus, where they were able unseen to effect a
landing&mdash;all save Pietro Corvo, the mute, who was drowned, and
Sinibaldi, who remained behind.</p>
<p>Like Graziani, Sinibaldi too wore a shirt of mail beneath his
doublet, as a precaution proper in one who engaged in such
hazardous methods of underground warfare. It was indeed an almost
inveterate habit with him. Less impetuous than those others, he
paused to calculate his chances, and bethought him that it was odds
this arrnour would sink him in the flood. So he stayed to doff it
first.</p>
<p>Vainly had he called upon the others to wait for him. Ranieri
had answered him standing upon the table ready for the leap.</p>
<p>'Wait? Body of God! Are you mad? Is this a time to wait?' Yet he
delayed to explain the precise and urgent need to depart. 'We must
run no risk of capture. For now more than ever must the thing be
done, or we are all dead men&mdash;and it must be done tonight as
was planned. Excess of preparation has gone near to undoing us. We
could have contrived excellently without that fool,' and he jerked
a thumb towards Graziani, 'as I told your excellency. And we shall
contrive no less excellently without him as it is. But contrive we
must, else, I say again, we are dead men&mdash;all of us.' And upon
that he went through the window and down into the water, after the
others, with a thudding splash.</p>
<p>With fingers that haste made clumsy, Sinibaldi tugged at the
buttons of his doublet, hampered by having tucked his sword under
his arm. But scarcely had Ranieri vanished into the night than the
door below was flung inward with a crash. There followed a sound of
angry voices, as the servants of the household were thrust roughly
aside, and ringing steps came clattering up the stairs.</p>
<p>Sinibaldi, still tugging at the buttons of his doublet, sprang
desperately towards the window, and wondered for a moment whether
he should take the risk of drowning. But even as he stood poised
for the leap, he remembered suddenly the immunity he derived from
the office that was his. After all, as the envoy of Venice he was
inviolable, a man upon whom no finger was to be laid by any without
provoking the resentment of the Republic. He had been over anxious.
He had nothing to fear where nothing could be proved against him.
Not even Graziani could have said enough to imperil the sacred
person of an ambassador, and it was odds that Graziani would never
say anything again.</p>
<p>So he sheathed his sword, readjusted his doublet and composed
himself. Indeed he actually went the length of opening the door to
the invaders, calling to guide them:</p>
<p>'This way! This way!'</p>
<p>They swarmed in, all ten of them, the grizzled antient at their
head, so furiously that they bore the prince backwards, and all but
trampled on him.</p>
<p>Barbo checked them in mid-chamber, and looked round bewildered,
until his eyes alighted upon his fallen, blood-bedabbled captain
huddled at the foot of the wall. At the sight he roared like a bull
to express his anger, what time his followers closed about the
saturnine Venetian.</p>
<p>With as great dignity as was possible to a man at such a
disadvantage, Sinibaldi sought to hold them off.</p>
<p>'You touch me at your peril,' he warned them. 'I am Prince
Marcantonio Sinibaldi, the Envoy of Venice.'</p>
<p>The antient swung half round to answer him, snarling:</p>
<p>'Were you Prince Lucifer, Envoy of Hell, you should still
account for what was doing here and how my captain came by his
hurt. Make him fast!'</p>
<p>The men-at-arms obeyed with a very ready will, for Graziani was
beloved of all that rode with him. It was in vain that the Venetian
stormed and threatened, pleaded and protested. They treated him as
if they had never heard tell of the sacredness with which the
person of an ambassador is invested. They disarmed him, bound his
wrists behind him, like any common malefactor's, and thrust him
contumeliously from the room down the stairs and so, without hat or
cloak, out into the murky wind-swept street.</p>
<p>Four of them remained above at the antient's bidding, whilst he
himself went down upon his knees beside his fallen captain to look
to his condition. And at once Graziani began to show signs of life.
Indeed he had shown that he was not dead the moment the door had
closed after the departing men.</p>
<p>Supported now by Barbo he sat up, and with his left hand smeared
away some of the blood that almost blinded him, and looked dully at
his antient, who grunted and swore to express the joyous reaction
from his despair.</p>
<p>'I am alive, Barbo,' he said, though his voice came feebly.
'But, Body of God! you were no more than in time to find me so. Had
you been a minute later you would have been too late for
me&mdash;aye, and perhaps for the Duke too.' He smiled faintly.
'When I found that valour would no longer avail me I had recourse
to craft. It is well to play the fox when you cannot play the lion.
With this gash over the head and my face smeared in blood, I
pretended to be done for. But I was conscious throughout, and it is
a grim thing, Barbo, consciously to take the chance of death
without daring to lift a finger to avert it lest thereby you
hastened it on. I...' he gulped, and his head hung down, showing
that his strength was ebbing. Then he rallied desperately, almost
by sheer force of will. There was something he must say, ere
everything was blotted out as he felt it would be soon. 'Get you to
my Lord Duke, Barbo. Make haste! Tell him that here was some
treason plotting...something that is to be done tonight...that will
still be done by those who escaped. Bid him look to himself.
Hasten, man. Say I...'</p>
<p>'Their names! Their names!' cried the antient urgently, seeing
his captain on the point of swooning.</p>
<p>Graziani reared his head again, and slowly opened his dull eyes.
But he did not answer. His lids drooped, and his head lolled
sideways against his antient's shoulder. It was as if by an effort
of sheer will he had but kept a grip of his senses until he could
utter that urgent warning. Then, his duty done, he relinquished
that painful hold, and allowed himself to slip into the peace and
the shadows of unconsciousness, exhausted.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>The great need for urgency, the chief reason why 'the thing'
must be done that night, as the Lord Ranieri had said before he
dived from his window into the river, lay in the circumstance that
it was the Duke's last night in the city of Rimini. On the morrow
he marched with his army upon Faenza and the Manfredi.</p>
<p>It had therefore seemed proper to the councillors and patricians
of Rimini to mark their entire submission to his authority by a
banquet in his honour at the Palazzo Pubblico. At this banquet were
assembled all Riminese that were noble or notable, and a great
number of repatriated patricians, the <i>fuorusciti</i> whom upon
one pretext or another the hated Malatesta tyrant had driven from
his dominions that he might enrich himself by the confiscation of
their possessions. Jubilantly came they now with their ladies to do
homage to the Duke who had broken the power and delivered the State
from the thraldom of the iniquitous Pandolfaccio, assured that his
justice would right to the full the wrongs which they had
suffered.</p>
<p>Present, too, were the envoys and ambassadors of several Italian
powers sent to felicitate Cesare Borgia upon his latest conquest.
But it was in vain that the young Duke turned his hazel eyes this
way and that in quest of Marcantonio Sinibaldi, the princely
envoy-extraordinary of the Most Serene Republic. The
envoy-extraordinary was nowhere to be seen in that courtly
gathering, and the Duke, who missed nothing and who disliked
leaving riddles unsolved&mdash;particularly when they concerned a
State that was hostile to himself&mdash;was vexed to know the
reason of this absence.</p>
<p>It was the more remarkable since Prince Sinibaldi's lady, a
stately blonde woman, whose stomacher was a flashing cuirass of
gems, was seated near Cesare's right hand, between the sober black
velvet of the President of the Council and the flaming scarlet of
the handsome Cardinal-legate, thus filling the position to which
she was entitled by her lofty rank and the respect due to the great
Republic which her husband represented.</p>
<p>Another whose absence the Duke might have remarked was, of
course, the Lord Ranieri, who had excused himself, indeed, to the
president upon a plea of indisposition. But Valentinois was too
much concerned with the matter of Sinibaldi's whereabouts. He
lounged in his great chair, a long, supple incarnation of youth and
vigour, in a tight-fitting doublet of cloth of gold, with jewelled
bands at neck and wrists and waist. His pale, beautiful face was
thoughtful, and his tapering fingers strayed ever and anon to the
tips of his tawny silken beard.</p>
<p>The banquet touched its end, and the floor&mdash;of the great
hall was being cleared by the seneschal to make room for the
players sent from Mantua by the beautiful Marchioness Gonzaga who
were to perform a comedy for the company's delectation.</p>
<p>It was not comedy, however, but tragedy, all unsuspected, that
impended, and the actor who suddenly strode into that hall to speak
its prologue, thrusting rudely aside the lackeys who would have
hindered him, misliking his wild looks, was Barbo, the antient of
Graziani's company.</p>
<p>'My lord,' he cried, panting for breath. 'My lord Duke!' And his
hands fiercely cuffed the grooms who still sought to bar his
passage. 'Out of my way, oafs! I tell you that I must speak to his
highness. Out of my way!'</p>
<p>The company had fallen silent, some startled by this intrusion,
others conceiving that it might be the opening of the comedy that
was prepared. Into that silence cut the Duke's voice, crisp and
metallic:</p>
<p>'Let him approach!'</p>
<p>Instantly the grooms ceased their resistance, glad enough to do
so, for Barbo's hands were heavy and he was prodigal in the use of
them. Released, he strode up the hall and came to a standstill,
stiff and soldierly before the Duke, saluting almost curtly in his
eagerness.</p>
<p>'Who are you?' rapped his highness.</p>
<p>'My name is Barbo,' the soldier answered. 'I am an antient in
the condotta of Messer Angelo Graziani.'</p>
<p>'Why do you come thus? What brings you?'</p>
<p>'Treason, my lord&mdash;that is what brings me,' roared the
soldier, setting the company all agog.</p>
<p>Cesare alone showed no sign of excitement. His eyes calmly
surveyed this messenger, waiting. Thereupon Barbo plunged headlong
into the speech he had prepared. He spoke gustily, abruptly, his
voice shaken with the passion he could not quite suppress.</p>
<p>'My Captain, Messer Graziani, lies speechless and senseless with
a broken head, else were he here in my place, my lord, and perhaps
with a fuller tale. I can but tell what little I know, adding the
little that himself he told me ere his senses left him.</p>
<p>'By his command we&mdash;ten men of his company and
myself&mdash;watched a certain house into which he went tonight at
the first hour, with orders to break in should we receive a certain
signal. That signal we received. Acting instantly upon it
we...'</p>
<p>'Wait, man,' the Duke cut in. 'Let us have this tale in order
and in plain words. A certain house, you say. What house was
that?'</p>
<p>'The Lord Ranieri's palace, my lord.'</p>
<p>A stir of increasing interest rustled through the company, but
dominating it, and audible to him because it came from his
neighbourhood immediately on his right, the Duke caught a gasp, a
faint half-cry of one who has been startled into sudden fear. That
sound arrested his attention, and he shot a swift sidelong glance
in the direction whence it had come, to discover that the Princess
Sinibaldi had sunk back in her chair, her cheeks deadly white, her
blue eyes wide with panic. Even as he looked and saw, his swiftly
calculating mind had mastered certain facts and had found the
probable solution of the riddle that earlier had intrigued
him&mdash;the riddle of Sinibaldi's absence. He thought that he
knew now where the prince had been that evening, though he had yet
to learn the nature of this treason of which Barbo spoke, and in
which he could not doubt that Sinibaldi was engaged.</p>
<p>Even as this understanding flashed across his mind, the antient
was resuming his interrupted narrative.</p>
<p>'At the signal, then, my lord, we broke into...'</p>
<p>'Wait!' the Duke again checked him, raising a hand which
instantly imposed silence.</p>
<p>There followed a brief pause, Barbo standing stiffly waiting for
leave to continue, impatient of the restraint imposed upon his
eagerness. Cesare's glance, calm and so inscrutable as to appear
almost unseeing, had passed from the princess to Messer Paolo
Capello, the Venetian Orator, seated a little way down the hall on
the Duke's left. Cesare noted the man's tense attitude, the look of
apprehension on his round white face, and beheld in those signs the
confirmation of what already he had conjectured.</p>
<p>So Venice was engaged in this. Those implacable traders of the
Rialto were behind this happening at Ranieri's house in which one
of the Duke's captains had received a broken head. And the ordinary
envoy of Venice was anxiously waiting to learn what might have
befallen the envoy-extraordinary, so that he might promptly take
his measures.</p>
<p>Cesare knew the craft of the Most Serene and of its ambassadors.
He was here on swampy treacherous ground, and he must pick his way
with care. Certainly Messer Capello must not hear what this soldier
might have to tell, for then&mdash;<i>praemonitus, praemunitus</i>.
In the orator's uncertainty of what had passed might lie Cesare's
strength to deal with Venice, perhaps to unmask her.</p>
<p>'We are too public here,' he said to Barbo shortly, and on that
he rose.</p>
<p>Out of deference the entire company rose with him&mdash;all save
one. Sinibaldi's lady, indeed, went so far as to make the effort,
but faint as she was with fear, her limbs refused to do their
office, and she kept her seat, a circumstance which Cesare did not
fail to note.</p>
<p>He waved a hand to the banqueters, smiling urbanely. 'Sirs, and
ladies,' he said, 'I pray you keep your seats. It is not my desire
that you should be disturbed by this.' Then he turned to the
President of the Council. 'If you, sir, will give me leave apart a
moment with this fellow...'</p>
<p>'Assuredly, my lord, assuredly!' cried the President nervously,
flung into confusion by this deference from one of the Duke's
exalted quality. 'This way, Magnificent. This closet here...You
will be private.'</p>
<p>Stammering, fluttering, he had stepped down the hall, the Duke
following, and Barbo clanking after them. The President opened a
door, and drawing aside, he bowed low and waved the Duke into a
small ante-chamber.</p>
<p>Cesare passed in with Barbo following. The door closed after
them, and a murmur reached them of the babble that broke forth
beyond it.</p>
<p>The room was small, but richly furnished, possibly against the
chance of its use being desired by his highness. The middle of its
tessellated floor was occupied by a table with massively carved
supporting cupids, near which stood a great chair upholstered in
crimson velvet. The room was lighted by a cluster of wax candles in
a candle-branch richly wrought in the shape of a group of scaling
titans.</p>
<p>Cesare flung himself into the chair, and turned to Barbo. 'Now
your tale,' he said shortly.</p>
<p>Barbo threw wide at last the floodgates of his eagerness, and
let his tale flow forth. He related in fullest detail the
happenings of that night at Ranieri's palace, repeating faithfully
the words that Graziani had uttered, and concluding on the
announcement that he had captured at least one of the
conspirators&mdash;the Prince Marcantonio Sinibaldi.</p>
<p>'I trust that in this I have done well, my lord,' the fellow
added with some hesitation. 'It seemed no less than Messer Graziani
ordered. Yet his Magnificence spoke of being an ambassador of the
Most Serene...'</p>
<p>'The Devil take the Most Serene and her ambassadors,' flashed
Cesare, betrayed into it by his inward seething rage. On the
instant he suppressed all show of feeling. 'Be content. You have
done well,' he said shortly.</p>
<p>He rose, turned his back on the antient, and strode to the
uncurtained gleaming windows. There he stood a moment, staring out
into the starlit night, fingering his beard, his brow dark with
thought. Then he came slowly back, his head bowed, nor did he raise
it until he stood again before the antient.</p>
<p>'You have no hint&mdash;no suspicion of the nature of this
conspiracy? Of what is this thing they were planning and are still
to attempt tonight?' he asked.</p>
<p>'None, my lord. I have said all I know.'</p>
<p>'Nor who were the men that escaped?'</p>
<p>'Nor that, my lord, save that one of them would no doubt be the
Lord Ranieri.'</p>
<p>'Ah, but the others...and we do not even know how many there
were...'</p>
<p>Cesare checked. He had bethought him of the Princess Sinibaldi.
This urgently needed information might be wrung from her, or as
much of it as lay within her knowledge. That she possessed such
knowledge her bearing had proclaimed. He smiled darkly.</p>
<p>'Desire Messer the President of the Council to attend me here
together with the Princess Sinibaldi. Then do you await my orders.
And see to it that you say no word of this to any.'</p>
<p>Barbo saluted and withdrew upon that errand. Cesare paced slowly
back to the window, and waited, his brow against the cool pane, his
mind busy until the door re-opened and the President ushered in the
Princess.</p>
<p>The President came avid for news. Disappointment awaited him. 'I
but desired you, sir, as an escort for this lady.' Cesare informed
him. 'If you will give us leave together...'</p>
<p>Stifling his regrets and murmuring his acquiescence, the man
effaced himself. When they were alone together Cesare turned to the
woman and observed the deathly pallor of her face, the agitated
gallop of her bosom. He judged her shrewdly as one whose tongue
would soon be loosed by fear.</p>
<p>He bowed to her, and with a smile and the very courtliest and
deferential grace he proffered her the great gilt and crimson
chair. In silence she sank into it, limply and grateful for its
support. She dabbed her lips with a gilt-edged handkerchief, her
startled eyes never leaving the Duke's face, as if their glance
were held in fascinated subjection.</p>
<p>Standing by the table at which she now sat, Cesare rested his
finger-tips upon the edge of it, and leaned slightly across towards
her.</p>
<p>'I have sent for you, Madonna,' he said, his tone very soft and
gentle, 'to afford you the opportunity of rescuing your husband's
neck from the hands of my strangler.'</p>
<p>In itself it was a terrifying announcement, and it was rendered
the more terrifying by the gentle, emotionless tones in which it
was uttered. It did not fail of its calculated effect.</p>
<p>'O God!' gasped the afflicted woman, and clutched her white
bosom with both hands. 'Gesù! I knew it! My heart had told me.'</p>
<p>'Do not alarm yourself, Madonna, I implore you. There is not the
cause,' he assured her, and no voice could have been more soothing.
'The Prince Sinibaldi is below, awaiting my pleasure. But I have no
pleasure, Princess, that is not your pleasure. Your husband's life
is in your own hands. I place it there. He lives or dies as you
decree.'</p>
<p>She looked up into his beautiful young face, into those hazel
eyes that looked too gentle now, and she cowered abjectly, cringing
before him. She was left in doubt of the meaning of his ambiguous
words, and his almost wooing manner. And this too he had intended;
deliberate in his ambiguity, using it as a flame of fresh terror in
which to scorch her will, until it should become pliant as heated
metal.</p>
<p>He saw the scarlet flush rise slowly up to stain her neck and
face, whilst her eyes remained fixed upon his own.</p>
<p>'My lord!' she panted. 'I know not what you mean. You...' And
then her spirit rallied. He saw her body stiffen, and her glance
harden and grow defiant. But when she spoke her voice betrayed her
by its quaver.</p>
<p>'Prince Sinibaldi is the accredited envoy of the Most Serene.
His person is sacred. A hurt to him were as a hurt to the Republic
whose representative he is, and the Republic is not slow to avenge
her hurts. You dare not touch him.'</p>
<p>He continued to regard her, smiling. 'That I have done already.
Have I not said that he is a prisoner now&mdash;below
here&mdash;bound and awaiting my pleasure.' And he repeated his
phrase. 'But my pleasure, Madonna, shall be your pleasure.'</p>
<p>Yet all the answer she could return him was a reiteration of her
cry:</p>
<p>'You dare not! You dare not!'</p>
<p>The smile perished slowly from his face. He inclined his head to
her, though not without a tinge of mockery...</p>
<p>'I will leave you happy, then, in that conviction,' he said on a
note at once so sardonic and sinister that it broke her newfound
spirit into shards.</p>
<p>As if he accepted the fruitlessness of the interview, and
accounted it concluded, he turned and stepped to the door. At this
her terror, held in check a moment, swept over her again like a
flood. She staggered to her feet, one hand on the table to support
her, the other at her breast.</p>
<p>'My lord! My lord! A moment! Pity!'</p>
<p>He paused, and half-turned, his fingers already upon the
latch.</p>
<p>'I will have pity, Madonna, if you will teach me pity&mdash;if
you will show me pity.' He came back to her slowly, very grave now.
'This husband of yours has been taken in treason. If you would not
have him strangled this night, if you would ever hold him warm and
living in your arms again, it is yours to rescue him from what
impends.'</p>
<p>He was looking deep and earnestly into her eyes, and she bore
the glance, returned it wildly, in silence for a dozen heart-beats.
Then at last, her lids dropped. She bowed her head. Her pallor
seemed to deepen until her flesh was as if turned to wax.</p>
<p>'What...what do you require of me?' she breathed in a small,
fluttering voice.</p>
<p>There was never a man more versed than he in the uses of
ambiguity.</p>
<p>He had employed it now so as to produce in her the maximum of
terror&mdash;so as to convey to her a suggestion that he asked the
maximum price. Thus when he made clear his real meaning, there
would be reaction from her worst dread, and in that reaction he
would trap her. The great sacrifice he demanded, would be dwarfed
in her view by relief, would seem small by comparison with the
sacrifice his ambiguity had led her to fancy he required.</p>
<p>So when she asked that faint, piteous question, 'What do you
require of me?' he answered swift and sharply with words that he
had rendered unexpected:</p>
<p>'All that is known to you of this conspiracy in which he was
taken.'</p>
<p>He caught the upward flash of her eyes; their look of amazement,
almost of relief, and knew that he had made her malleable. She
swayed where she stood. He steadied her with ready hands, and
gently pressed her back into her chair.</p>
<p>And now he proceeded to hammer the metal he had softened.</p>
<p>'Come, Madonna, use dispatch, I beg,' he urged her, his voice
level but singularly compelling. 'Do not strain a patience that has
its roots in mercy. Consider that the information I require of you,
and for which I offer you so generous a price, the torture can
extract for me from this husband of yours. I will be frank with you
as at an Easter shrift. It is true I do not wish to embroil myself
with the Most Serene Republic, and that I seek to gain my ends by
gentle measures. But, by the Host! if my gentle measures do not
prevail with you, why then Prince Sinibaldi shall be squeezed dry
upon the rack, and what is left of him flung to the stranglers
afterwards&mdash;aye, though he were an envoy of the Empire itself.
My name,' he ended, almost grimly, 'is Cesare Borgia. You know what
repute I enjoy in Venice.'</p>
<p>She stared at him, considering, confused, and voiced the very
question that perplexed her.</p>
<p>'You offer me his life&mdash;his life and freedom&mdash;in
exchange for this information?'</p>
<p>'That is what I offer.'</p>
<p>She pressed her hands to her brows, seeking to fathom the
mystery of an offer that appeared to hold such extraordinary
elements of contradiction.</p>
<p>'But then...' she began, tremulously, and paused for lack of
words in which to frame her doubts.</p>
<p>'If you need more assurance, Madonna, you shall have it,' he
said. 'You shall have the assurance of my oath. I swear to you by
my honour and my hope of Heaven that neither in myself nor through
another shall I procure the hurt of so much as a hair of
Sinibaldi's head, provided that I know all of the treason that was
plotting to be done this night and that thus I may be able to avoid
the trap that I believe is set for me.'</p>
<p>That resolved her doubts. She saw the reason of the thing;
understood that after all he but offered Sinibaldi's life in
exchange for his own safety. Yet even then she hesitated, thinking
of her husband.</p>
<p>'He may blame me...' she began, faltering.</p>
<p>Cesare's eyes gleamed. He leaned over her. 'He need never know,'
he urged her insidiously.</p>
<p>'You...you pledge your word,' she insisted, as if to convince
herself that all would be well.</p>
<p>'Already have I pledged it, Madonna,' he answered, and he could
not altogether repress a note of bitterness. For he had pledged it
reluctantly, because he conceived that no less would satisfy her.
It was a bargain he would have avoided, had there been a way. For
he did not lightly forgive, and he did not relish the notion of
Sinibaldi's going unpunished. But he had perceived that unless he
gave this undertaking he would be without the means to parry the
blow that might be struck at any moment.</p>
<p>'I have pledged it, Madonna,' he repeated, 'and I do not
forswear myself.'</p>
<p>'You mean that you will not even allow him to know that you
know? That you will but use the information I may give you to
procure your own safety?'</p>
<p>'That is what I mean,' he assured her, and waited, confident now
that he was about to have the thing he desired and for which he had
bidden something recklessly.</p>
<p>And at last he got the story&mdash;the sum total of her
knowledge. Last night Ranieri and Prince Sinibaldi had sat late
alone together. Her suspicions had earlier been aroused that her
husband was plotting something with this friend of the fallen
Malatesta. Driven by these suspicions, jealous perhaps to find
herself excluded from her husband's confidence in this matter, she
had played the eavesdropper, and she had overheard that it was
against Cesare Borgia's life that they conspired.</p>
<p>'The Lord Ranieri,' she said, 'spoke of this banquet at the
Palazzo Pubblico, urging that the opportunity it afforded would be
a rare one. It was Ranieri, my lord, who was the villain, the
tempter in this affair.'</p>
<p>'Yes, yes, no doubt,' said Cesare impatiently. 'It matters not
which was the tempter, which the tempted. The story of it!'</p>
<p>'Ranieri knew that you would be returning to sleep at
Sigismondo's Castle, and that it was planned to escort you thither
in procession by torchlight. At some point on your way&mdash;but
where I cannot tell you, for this much I did not learn&mdash;at
some point on your way, then, Ranieri spoke of two crossbow-men
that were to be ambushed, to shoot you.'</p>
<p>She paused a moment. But Cesare offered no comment, betrayed no
faintest perturbation at the announcement. So she proceeded.</p>
<p>'But there was a difficulty. Ranieri did not account it
insuperable, but to make doubly sure he desired it should be
removed. He feared that if mounted guards chanced to ride beside
you, it might not be easy for the crossbow-men to shoot past them.
Foot-guards would not signify, as the men could shoot over their
heads. But it was necessary, he held, to make quite sure that none
but foot-guards should be immediately about your person, so that
riding clear above them you should offer a fair mark. To make sure
of this it was that he proposed to seduce one of your
captains&mdash;I think it would be this man Graziani, whom the
soldier told you had been wounded. Ranieri was satisfied that
Graziani was disaffected towards your highness, and that he might
easily be bought to lend a hand in their enterprise.'</p>
<p>Valentinois smiled slowly, thoughtfully. He knew quite well the
source of Ranieri's rash assumption. Then, as he considered
further, that smile of his grew faintly cruel, reflecting his
mind.</p>
<p>'That is all I overheard, my lord,' she added after an instant's
pause.</p>
<p>He stirred at that: threw back his head and laughed shortly.
'Enough, as God lives,' he snorted.</p>
<p>She looked at him, and the sight of his countenance and the
blaze of his tawny eyes filled her with fresh terror. She started
to her feet, and appealed to him to remember his oath. At that
appeal he put aside all trace of wrath, and smiled again.</p>
<p>'Let your fears have rest,' he bade her. 'I have sworn, and by
what I have sworn I shall abide. Nor I nor man of mine shall do
hurt to Prince Sinibaldi.'</p>
<p>She wanted to pour out her gratitude and her deep sense of his
magnanimity. But words failed her for a moment, and ere she had
found them, he was urging her to depart.</p>
<p>'Madonna, you were best away, I think. You are overwrought. I
fear that I have tried you sorely.'</p>
<p>She confessed to her condition, and professed that she would be
glad of his leave to return home at once.</p>
<p>'The prince shall follow you,' he promised her, as he conducted
her to the door. 'First, however, we shall endeavour to make our
peace with him, and I do not doubt but that we shall succeed. Be
content,' he added, observing the fresh panic that stared at him
from her blue eyes&mdash;for she suddenly bethought her of what
manner of peace it was Cesare's wont to make with his enemies. 'He
shall be treated by me with all honour. I shall endeavour by
friendliness to win him from these traitors who have seduced
him.'</p>
<p>'It is so&mdash;it is so!' she exclaimed, seizing with avidity
upon that excuse which he so generously implied for the man who
would have contrived his murder. 'It was none of his devising. He
was lured to it by the evil counsels of others.'</p>
<p>'How can I doubt it, since you assure me of it?' he replied with
an irony so subtle that it escaped her. He bowed, and opened the
door.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>Following her out into the great hall, where instantly silence
fell and a hundred eyes became levelled upon them, he beckoned the
President of the Council, who hovered near, awaiting him. Into the
President's care he surrendered the princess, desiring him to
conduct her thence and to her litter.</p>
<p>Again he bowed to her, profoundly in farewell, and as she passed
out of the hall, her hand upon the arm of the President, he stepped
up to his place at the board again, and with a light jest and a
laugh, invited the return of mirth, as if no thought or care
troubled his mind.</p>
<p>He saw that Capello watched him with saucer eyes, and he could
imagine the misgivings that filled the Venetian Orator's heart as a
result of that long interview which had ended in the withdrawal of
Sinibaldi's lady from the feast. Messer Capello should be
abundantly entertained, he thought with grim humour, and when the
President had returned from escorting the princess to her litter,
Cesare raised a finger and signed to the steel-clad antient who
stood waiting as he had been bidden.</p>
<p>Barbo clanked forward, and the talk and laughter rippled down to
an expectant hush.</p>
<p>'Bring in the Prince Sinibaldi,' Cesare commanded, and therewith
he fetched consternation back into that hall.</p>
<p>The portly, slimy Capello was so wrought upon by his
perturbation at this command that he heaved himself to his feet,
and made so bold as to go round to Cesare's chair.</p>
<p>'Magnificent,' he muttered fearfully, 'what is this of Prince
Sinibaldi?'</p>
<p>The Duke flung at him a glance contemptuously over his
shoulder.</p>
<p>'Wait, and you shall see,' he said.</p>
<p>'But, my lord, I implore you to consider that the Most
Serene...'</p>
<p>'A little patience, sir,' snapped Cesare, and the glance of his
eyes drove back the flabby ambassador like a blow. He hung there
behind the Duke's chair, very white, and breathing labouredly. His
fleshiness troubled him at such times as these.</p>
<p>The double doors were flung open, and Barbo re-entered. He was
followed by four men-at-arms of Graziani's condotta, and in their
midst walked Prince Sinibaldi, the envoy-extraordinary of the Most
Serene Republic. But his air and condition were rather those of a
common malefactor. His wrists were still pinioned behind his back;
he was without hat or cloak; his clothes were in some disarray, as
a result of his struggles, and his mien was sullen.</p>
<p>The company's amazement deepened, and a murmur ran round the
board.</p>
<p>At a sign from the Duke the guards fell back a little from their
prisoner, leaving him face to face with Cesare.</p>
<p>'Untie his wrists,' the Duke commanded, and Barbo instantly
slashed through the prince's bonds.</p>
<p>Conscious of the eyes upon him, the Venetian rallied his
drooping spirits. He flung back his head, drew himself up, a tall
figure full now of dignity and scorn, his eyes set boldly upon
Cesare's impassive face. Suddenly, unbidden, he broke into a
torrent of angry speech.</p>
<p>'Is it by your commands, my lord duke, that these indignities
are put upon the inviolable person of an envoy?' he demanded. 'The
Most Serene whose mouthpiece I have the honour to be, whose
representative I am, is not likely to suffer with patience such
dishonour.'</p>
<p>Within the Duke's reach stood an orange that had been injected
with rose attar to be used as a perfume ball. He took it up in his
long fingers and delicately sniffed it.</p>
<p>'I trust,' said he in that quiet voice which he could render so
penetrating and so sweetly sinister, 'that I apprehend you amiss
when I apprehend that you threaten. It is not wise to threaten us,
excellency&mdash;not even for an envoy of the Most Serene.' And he
smiled upon the Venetian, but with such a smile that Sinibaldi
quailed and lost on the instant much of his fine arrogance&mdash;as
many another bold fellow had done when face to face with the young
Duke of Valentinois.</p>
<p>Capello in the background wrung his hands and with difficulty
suppressed a groan.</p>
<p>'I do not threaten, my lord...' began Sinibaldi.</p>
<p>'I am relieved to hear it,' said the Duke.</p>
<p>'I protest,' Sinibaldi concluded. 'I protest against the
treatment I have received. These ruffianly soldiers...'</p>
<p>'Ah,' said the Duke, and again he sniffed his orange. 'Your
protest shall have all attention. Never suppose me capable of
overlooking anything that is your due. Continue, then, I beg. Let
us hear, my lord, your version of the night's affair. Condescend to
explain the error of which you have been the victim, and I promise
you the blunderers shall be punished. I will punish them the more
gladly since it is in my nature not to like blunderers. You were
saying that these ruffianly soldiers...But continue, pray.'</p>
<p>Sinibaldi did not continue. Instead he began at the beginning of
the tale he had prepared during the ample leisure that had been
accorded him for the task. And it was a crafty tale, most cunningly
conceived, and based as all convincing tales should be upon
actualities. It was, in fact, precisely such a tale as Graziani
might have told had he been there to speak, and being therefore
true&mdash;though not true of Sinibaldi&mdash;would bear testing
and should carry conviction.</p>
<p>'I was bidden, Magnificent, in secret tonight to a meeting held
at the house of my Lord Ranieri, whose guest it happens that I have
been since my coming to Rimini. I went urged by the promise that a
matter of life and death was to be dealt with, which concerned me
closely.</p>
<p>'I found a small company assembled there, but before they would
reveal to me the real purpose of that gathering, they desired me to
make an irrevocable oath that whether or not I became a party to
the matters that were to be disclosed to me, I would never divulge
a single word of it nor the name of any of those whom I met
there.</p>
<p>'Now I am not a fool, Magnificent.'</p>
<p>'Who implies it?' wondered Cesare aloud.</p>
<p>'I am not a fool, and I scented treason instantly, as they knew
I must. It is to be assumed that by some misconception they had
come to think that I had ends to serve by listening to treason, by
becoming a party to it. Therein lay their mistake&mdash;a mistake
that was near to costing me my life, and has occasioned me this
indignity of which I complain. I will not trouble your magnificence
with my personal feelings. They matter nothing. I am an envoy, and
just as I know and expect what is due to me, so do I know and
fulfil&mdash;what is due from me. These fools should have
considered that more fully. Since they did not...'</p>
<p>'God give us patience!' broke in the Duke. 'Will you go over
that again? This is mere oratory, sir. Your tale, sir&mdash;your
tale. Let the facts plead for you.'</p>
<p>Sinibaldi inclined his head with dignity.</p>
<p>'Indeed, your highness is right&mdash;as ever. To my tale then.
Where was I? Ah, yes!</p>
<p>'When an oath of that nature was demanded of me I would at once
have drawn back. But I perceived that already I had gone too far in
thoughtlessly joining that assembly and that they would never
suffer me to depart again and spread the alarm of what was doing
there. They dared not for their lives' sake. So much was clear.
Therefore, for my own life's sake, and in self-defence I took the
oath imposed. But having taken it, I announced plainly that I
desired to hear no more of any plot. I warned them that they were
rash in having set their hands to any secret business, and that
if&mdash;as I conceived&mdash;it had for aim your highness' hurt
then they were more than rash since your magnificence has as many
eyes as Argus. Upon that I begged them to suffer me to depart since
I was sworn to silence.</p>
<p>'But men of their sort are easily fearful of betrayal, and do
not lay much store by oaths. They refused to consent to my
departure, protesting that I was bent upon denouncing them. From
words we passed soon enough to blows. They set upon me, and a fight
ensued in which one of them fell to my sword. Then the noise of our
brawling brought in a patrol&mdash;but for which it is odds I
should have left my life there. When these soldiers broke in the
plotters flung themselves from a window into the river, whilst I
remained, having naught to fear since I was innocent of all evil.
It was thus that I alone came to be taken by these fellows who
would listen to no assurances I offered them.'</p>
<p>From behind the Duke's chair came a deep sigh of relief uttered
by the quaking Capello. He advanced a step.</p>
<p>'You see, my lord, you see...' he was beginning.</p>
<p>'Peace, man!' the Duke bade him sharply. 'Be assured I see as
far as any man, and need not borrow your eyes to help me, Ser
Capello.' Then turning again to Sinibaldi, and speaking very
courteously, 'My lord,' he said, 'it grieves me you should have
been mishandled by my soldiery. But I trust to your generosity to
see that until we had this explanation, the appearances were
against you; and you will acquit us, I am sure, of any discourtesy
to the Most Serene. Let me add even that in the case of anyone less
accredited than yourself, or representing a power upon whose
friendship I did not so implicitly depend as I do upon that of
Venice: (he said it with all the appearance of sincerity and with
no slightest trace of irony) 'I might be less ready to accept that
explanation, and I might press for the names of the men who, you
are satisfied, were engaged in treason.'</p>
<p>'Those names, Magnificent, already I should have afforded you
but for the oath that binds me,' answered Sinibaldi.</p>
<p>'That too I understand; and so, my lord, out of deference and to
mark my esteem of you and of the Republic you represent, I do not
ask a question you might have a difficulty in answering. Let us
forget this unhappy incident.'</p>
<p>But at that the antient, who loved Graziani as faithful hound
its master, was unable longer to contain himself. Was the Duke mad,
to accept so preposterous a tale&mdash;to swallow this lying
fabrication as smoothly and easily as if it were a sugared egg.</p>
<p>'My lord,' he broke in, 'if what he says is true...'</p>
<p>'If?' cried Cesare. 'Who dares to doubt it? Is he not Prince
Sinibaldi and the envoy of the Most Serene? Who will cast a doubt
upon his word?'</p>
<p>'I will, my lord,' answered the soldier stoutly.</p>
<p>'By the Host! now here's audacity.'</p>
<p>'My lord, if what he says is true then it follows that Messer
Graziani was a traitor&mdash;for it was Messer Graziani who was
wounded in that brawl, and he would have us believe that the man he
wounded was one of those that plotted with his innocence.'</p>
<p>'That, quite clearly, is what he has said,' Cesare replied.</p>
<p>'Why then,' said Barbo, and he plucked the rude buffalo gauntlet
from his left hand, 'I say that who says that is a liar, whether he
be a prince of Venice or a prince of hell.' And he raised the glove
he had plucked from his hand, clearly intending to fling it in
Sinibaldi's face.</p>
<p>But the Duke's voice checked the intention.</p>
<p>'Hold!' it bade him sharply; and instantly he paused. The Duke
looked at him with narrowing eyes. 'You all but did a thing that
might have cost you very dear,' he said. 'Get out of my sight, and
take your men with you. But hold yourself at my commands outside.
We will talk of this again, perhaps tonight, perhaps tomorrow,
Messer Barbo. Go!'</p>
<p>Chilled by tone and glance, Barbo stiffened, saluted, then with
a malignant scowl at Sinibaldi, clanked down the hall and out,
counting himself as good as hanged, yet more concerned with the
foul slander uttered against his captain than with any fate that
might lie in store for himself.</p>
<p>Cesare looked at Sinibaldi, and smiled. 'Forgive the lout,' he
said. 'Honesty, and fidelity to his captain prompted him. Tomorrow
he shall be taught his manners. Meanwhile, of your graciousness
forget it with the rest. A place for the Prince Sinibaldi here at
my side. Come, my lord, let me play host to you, and make you some
amends for the rude handling you have suffered. Never blame the
master for the stupidity of his lackeys. The Council whose guest I
am have spread a noble entertainment. Here is a wine that is a very
unguent for wounded souls&mdash;a whole Tuscan summer has been
imprisoned in every flagon of it. And there is to be a
comedy&mdash;delayed too long by these untoward happenings. Sir
President, what of these players sent from Mantua? The Prince
Sinibaldi is to be amused, that he may forget how he has been
vexed.'</p>
<p>You see Prince Sinibaldi, then, limp with amazement, shaken by
relief from his long tension, scarcely believing himself out of his
terrible position, wondering whether perhaps all this were not a
dream. He sank into the chair that was placed for him at the Duke's
side, he drank of the wine that at the Duke's bidding was poured
for him by one of the scarlet lackeys. And then, even as he drank,
he almost choked upon the sudden fresh fear that assailed him with
the memory of certain stories of Capello's concerning Cesare's
craft in the uses of poisons.</p>
<p>But even as in haste he set down his cup and half-turned, he
beheld the lackey pouring wine from the same beaker for the
venom-taster who stood behind the Duke's chair, and so he was
reassured.</p>
<p>The players followed, and soon the company's attention was
engrossed entirely by the plot of the more or less lewd comedy they
performed. But Sinibaldi's thoughts were anywhere but with the
play. He was considering all that had happened, and most of all his
present condition and the honour done him by the Duke as a measure
of amends for the indignities he had endured. He was a man of
sanguine temperament, and gradually his mistrust was dissipated by
the increasing conviction that the Duke behaved thus towards him
out of dread of the powerful Republic whose representative he was.
Hence was he gradually heartened to the extent of conceiving a
certain measure of contempt for this Valentinois of such terrible
repute, and a certain assurance even that Ranieri and the others
would yet carry out the business that had been concerted.</p>
<p>And meanwhile Cesare, beside him, sitting hunched in his chair,
his chin in his hand, his eyes intent upon the players, was
conscious of as little of the comedy as was Sinibaldi. Had the
company been less engrossed its members might have observed how set
remained the Duke's countenance, and how vacant. Like Sinibaldi he,
too, was concerned, to the exclusion of all else, with the thing
that was to be done that night. He was wondering, too, how far the
Most Serene itself might have a hand in this murderous affair, how
far Sinibaldi might be an agent sent to do this assassin's work. He
bethought him of how at every step in his career, and in every way
within her power, Venice had betrayed her implacable hostility; he
remembered how she had gone to work with the insidious weapons of
intrigue and slander to embroil him now with France, now with
Spain, and how by arms and money she had secretly reinforced his
enemies against him.</p>
<p>Was Sinibaldi, then, but the hand of the Republic in this
matter? Plainly it must be so, since Sinibaldi personally could
have no cause to seek his life. Sinibaldi then had all the
resources of the Republic behind him. He was a tool that must be
broken, both because he had lent himself to this infamous
treachery, and because in breaking him would lie Cesare's best
answer to the Venetian trader-princes.</p>
<p>Yet although he saw plainly what was to do, the means of doing
it were none so plain. He must pick his way carefully through this
tangle, lest it should enmesh him and bring him down. Firstly he
had pledged his princely word that he would do no hurt to
Sinibaldi. If possible he would observe the letter of that promise;
as for the spirit of it, it were surely unreasonable to expect him
to respect that also. Secondly to destroy Sinibaldi without
destroying with him his confederates were to leave the treachery
not only alive but quickened into activity by the spur of revenge;
in such a case his own danger would persist, and if the arbalest
bolt were not loosed at him tonight it might come tomorrow or the
next day. Thirdly, in dealing with this pack of Venetian murderers
he must so go to work as to leave Venice no case for grievance at
the result.</p>
<p>So far as Sinibaldi himself was concerned, it must be remembered
that the tale he had told so publicly and circumstantially was
impossible of refutation save by Graziani&mdash;and Graziani was
insensible and might not live to refute it, whilst even if he did,
it would be but the word of Graziani&mdash;a captain of fortune,
one of a class never deemed over scrupulous&mdash;against the word
of Sinibaldi&mdash;a patrician and a prince of Venice.</p>
<p>There you have the nice problem by which Cesare found himself
confronted and which he considered whilst with unseeing eyes he
watched the antics of the players; and you will agree that the
solution of it was matter enough to justify his absorption and to
call for all the <i>ingegno</i> which Macchiavelli, a connoisseur
in the matter, so profoundly admired in the Duke.</p>
<p>Light came to him towards the comedy's conclusion. The grim mask
of concentration that he had worn was suddenly relaxed, and for a
moment his eyes sparkled with almost wicked humour. He flung
himself back in his chair, and listened now to the epilogue spoken
by the leader of the company. At its close he led the applause by
detaching from his girdle a heavy purse, and flinging it down to
the players to mark his own appreciation of their efforts. Then he
turned to Sinibaldi to discuss with him a comedy of which neither
had much knowledge. He laughed and jested with the Venetian as with
an equal, overwhelming him by the courtly charm in which no man of
his day could surpass the Duke.</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>Came midnight at last&mdash;the hour at which it had been
arranged that the torchlight procession should set out from the
Palazzo Pubblico to escort the Duke back to the famous Rocca of
Sigismondo Malatesta, where he was housed. Valentinois gave the
signal for departure by rising, and instantly a regiment of grooms
and pages hung about him in attendance.</p>
<p>Sinibaldi, facing him, bowed low to take his leave, to go seek
his lady whose withdrawal from the banquet had been occasioned, as
he had been informed, by his own adventure. But Cesare would not
hear of parting from him yet awhile. He thanked Heaven in his most
gracious manner for the new friend it had that night vouchsafed
him.</p>
<p>'But for this mischance of yours, excellency, we might never
have come to such desirable knowledge of each other. Forgive me,
therefore, if I cannot altogether deplore it.'</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by so much honour, Sinibaldi could but bow again, in
such humility that you might almost hear him murmuring 'Domine non
sum dignus!' almost fancy him beating his secretly armoured breast
in self-abasement. And, meanwhile, the oily Capello hovering ever
nigh, like some tutelary deity, purred and smirked and rubbed his
gross white hands that anon should pen more obscenities in
defamation of this gracious Valentinois.</p>
<p>'Come, then, excellency,' the Duke continued. 'You shall ride
with me to the citadel, and there pledge our next meeting, which
may the gods please shall be soon. And Messer Capello here shall be
of the party. I take no denial. I shall account your refusal as the
expression of a lingering resentment at what has befallen you
through no fault of my own, and to my deep mortification. Come,
prince. They are waiting for us. Messer Capello, follow us.'</p>
<p>On the word he thrust an arm, lithe and supple as a thing of
steel, through that of Sinibaldi, and in this fashion the twain
stepped down the hall together, and along the gallery between the
files of courtiers gathered there to acclaim the Duke. It almost
seemed as if Cesare desired that Sinibaldi should share this honour
with him, and Capello following immediately upon their heels puffed
himself out with pride and satisfaction to see Valentinois doing
homage to the Most Serene Republic in so marked a manner through
the person of her envoy-extraordinary.</p>
<p>Thus they came out upon the courtyard into the ruddy glare of a
hundred flaming torches that turned to orange the yellowing old
walls of the Palazzo. Here was great press and bustle of grooms
about the cavaliers who were getting to horse and still more about
the ladies who were climbing to their litters.</p>
<p>It was here that Cesare and Sinibaldi were met by a pair of the
Duke's vermilion pages bearing his cloak and cap.</p>
<p>Now it happened that the cloak, which was fashioned from the
skin of a tiger, heavily laced with gold and reversed with yellow
satin, was as conspicuous as it was rare and costly. It was a
present that the Sultan Bajazet had sent the Borgia out of Turkey,
and Cesare had affected it since the cold weather had set in, not
only out of his inherent love of splendour, but also for the sake
of the great warmth which it afforded.</p>
<p>As the stripling stood before him now presenting that very
gorgeous mantle, the Duke swung suddenly upon Sinibaldi, standing
at his elbow.</p>
<p>'You have no cloak, my lord!' he cried in deep concern. 'No
cloak, and it is a bitter night.'</p>
<p>'A groom shall find me one, Magnificent: the Venetian answered,
and half turned aside to desire Capello give the order for him.</p>
<p>'Ah, wait,' said Cesare. He took the lovely tiger skin from the
hands of his page. 'Since not only in these my new dominions, but
actually out of loyalty to myself it was that you lost your cloak,
suffer me to replace it with this, and at the same time offer you
an all unworthy token of the esteem in which I hold your excellency
and the Serene Republic which you represent.'</p>
<p>Sinibaldi fell back a single step, and one of the pages told
afterwards that on his face was stamped the look of one in sudden
fear. He looked deep into the Duke's smiling eyes and perhaps he
saw there some faint trace of the mockery which he had fancied that
he detected in his smooth words.</p>
<p>Now Sinibaldi, as you will have seen by the promptitude and
thoroughness with which he adapted to himself the story of
Graziani's misadventure, was a crafty subtle-witted gentleman,
quick to draw inferences where once a clue was afforded him.</p>
<p>As he met now that so faintly significant smile of Cesare's, as
he pondered the faintly significant tone in which the Duke had
spoken, and as he considered the noble gift that was being
proffered him, understanding came to him swift, sudden and
startling as a flash of lightning in the night.</p>
<p>The Duke had never been deceived by his specious story; the Duke
knew the truth; the Duke's almost fawning friendliness&mdash;which
he, like a fool, had for a while fancied to be due to the Duke's
fear of Venice&mdash;had been so much make-believe, so much
mockery, the play of cat with mouse, the prelude to
destruction.</p>
<p>All this he understood now, and saw that he was
trapped&mdash;and trapped, moreover, with a cunning and a subtlety
that made it impossible for him so much as to utter a single word
to defend his life. For what could he say? How, short of an open
avowal which would be equally destructive to himself, short of
declaring that the wearing of that cloak would place him in mortal
peril, could he decline the proffered honour?</p>
<p>It came to him in his despair to refuse the gift peremptorily.
But then gifts from princes such as the Duke of Valentinois and
Romagna are not refused by ambassadors-extraordinary without
putting an affront upon the donor, and that not only in their own
personal quality but also in a sense, on behalf of the State they
represent.</p>
<p>Whichever way he turned there was no outlet. And the Duke
smiling ever stood before him, holding out the cloak which to
Sinibaldi was the very mantle of death.</p>
<p>And as if this had not been enough, the ineffable Capello must
shuffle forward, smirking and rubbing his hands in satisfaction at
this supremely gratifying subjection of the Duke to a proper
respect for the Most Serene Republic.</p>
<p>'A noble gift, highness!' he purred, 'a noble gift; worthy of
your potency's munificence.' Then, with a shaft of malice, he
added, that the Duke might know how fully his ulterior motives were
perceived and no doubt despised: 'And the honour to Prince
Sinibaldi will be held by the Most Serene as an honour to
herself.'</p>
<p>'It is my desire to honour both in the exact measure of their
due,' laughed Cesare, and Sinibaldi alone, his senses rendered
superacute by fear, caught the faintly sinister note in that laugh,
read the sinister meaning of those amiable words.</p>
<p>He trembled in the heart of him, cursing Capello for a fool.
Then, since he must submit, he took heart of grace. He found
courage in hope. He bethought him that after all that had happened
that night, it would be more than likely that the conspirators
would hold their hands at present, that they would postpone to a
more opportune season the thing that was to be done. If so, then
all would be well, and Cesare should be confounded yet.</p>
<p>Upon that hope he fastened tenaciously, desperately He assured
himself that he had gone too fast in his conclusions. After all,
Cesare could have no positive knowledge; with positive knowledge
the Duke would unhesitatingly have proceeded to more definite
measures. It was impossible that he should harbour more than
suspicions, and all his present intent would be to put those
suspicions to the test. If, as Sinibaldi now hoped, Ranieri and his
friends held their hands that night, Cesare must conclude that
those suspicions had been unfounded.</p>
<p>With such reasonings did the Prince Sinibaldi hearten himself,
knowing little of Borgia ways and nothing of Cesare's sworn promise
to the princess. He recovered quickly his assurance. Indeed, his
vacillation had been but momentary. Meeting dissimulation with
dissimulation, he murmured some graceful words of deep
gratification, submitted to have the cloak thrust upon him, and
even the velvet cap with its bordure of miniver that was also
Cesare's own, and which was pressed upon him on the same pretext
that had served for the cloak.</p>
<p>Thereafter he allowed himself to drift with the tide of things,
like a swimmer who, realizing that the current is too strong for
him, ceases to torture himself by the effort of stemming it, and
abandons himself, hoping that in its course that current will bring
him safe to shore. In this spirit he mounted the splendid Barbary
charger with its sweeping velvet trappings which also was Cesare's
own, and which became now a further token of his princely
munificence.</p>
<p>Yet that fool Capello, looking on, perceived nothing but what
was put before his eyes. He licked his faintly sneering lips over
this further proof of Cesare's servility to the Republic, and began
in his mind to shape the phrases in which he would rejoice the
hearts of the Ten with a description of it all.</p>
<p>The prince was mounted, and by his stirrup stood the Duke like
any equerry He looked up at the Venetian.</p>
<p>'That is a lively horse, my lord,' he said at parting, 'a fiery
and impulsive child of the desert. But I will bid my footmen hang
close upon your flanks, so that they will be at hand in case it
should grow restive.' And again Sinibaldi understood the true
meaning of those solicitous words, and conceived that he was meant
to realize how futile it would be in him to attempt to escape the
test to which he was to be submitted.</p>
<p>He bowed his acknowledgement of the warning and the provision,
and the Duke stepped back, took a plain black cloak and a black hat
from a page who had fetched them in answer to his bidding, and
mounted a very simply equipped horse which a groom surrendered to
him.</p>
<p>Thus that splendid company rode out into the streets of the
town, which were still thronged, for the people of Rimini had
waited for the spectacle of this torchlight procession that was to
escort the Duke's potency back to the Rocca of Sigismondo. To
gratify the people, the cavalcade went forward at a walking pace,
flanked on either side by a file of footmen bearing torches.</p>
<p>Acclamations greeted them, ringing and sincere, for the conquest
of Rimini by Cesare Borgia held for the people the promise of
liberation from the cruel yoke under which the tyrant Pandolfaccio
Malatesta had oppressed them. They knew the wisdom and liberality
of his rule elsewhere, and they hailed him now as their
deliverer.</p>
<p>'Duca! Duca! Valentino!' rang the cry, and Sinibaldi was perhaps
the only one in the cavalcade who remarked that the cry arose in a
measure as he himself came into view, that it was at
himself&mdash;travestied in Cesare's barbaric splendour&mdash;that
the people looked as they shouted and waved their caps. And so it
was, for there were few indeed in those lines of sightseers who
perceived that the tall man in the tiger-skin mantle and scarlet
and miniver bonnet riding that sumptuously caparisoned
horse&mdash;the most splendid figure in all that splendid
cavalcade&mdash;was not the Duke of Valentinois whom they
acclaimed; fewer still were there to pay much heed to the man in
the black cloak and heavy hat who came next, a few paces behind,
riding beside the Orator of Venice, who bestrode a white mule.</p>
<p>Thus the procession made its way across the wide square of the
Palazzo Pubblico, and down a narrow street into the main way that
runs east and west almost straight across the city from the Bridge
of Augustus to the Porta Romana.</p>
<p>At the corner of the Via della Rocca, such was the clamour of
the sightseers that none heard the twice repeated twang of an
arbalest-cord. Indeed the first intimation the Duke received that
the thing he expected had come to pass was when the cavalier in the
tiger-skin cloak was suddenly seen to crumple forward upon the neck
of his charger.</p>
<p>Instantly the grooms sprang to seize the bridle and support the
limp figure of its rider. Those following Cesare&mdash;Capello
foremost amongst them&mdash;reined in upon the instant; and a
sudden awe-stricken silence fell upon the assembled crowd, when,
notwithstanding the efforts of the grooms, the man whom they
imagined to be Cesare Borgia rolled sideways from the saddle into
the arms of those below, an arbalest bolt through his brain.</p>
<p>That moment of silent panic was succeeded by an awful cry, a
wail which in itself expressed the public fear of the awful
vengeance that might follow upon the city:</p>
<p>'The Duke is dead!'</p>
<p>And then in answer to that cry, by some unaccountable
magic&mdash;as it seemed to the people&mdash;there in his stirrups
stood the Duke himself, his head bare, his tawny hair glowing
ruddily in the torch-light, his brazen voice dominating the din and
confusion.</p>
<p>'It is murder!' he proclaimed, and added fiercely the question,
'Who has done this foul deed?' Then he flung an arm towards the
corner house on his right. 'In there!' he shouted to his
halberdiers who came thrusting towards him through the crowd. 'In,
I say, and on your lives see that not a man escapes you. It is the
Envoy of Venice whom they have murdered, and they shall pay for it
with their necks, whoever they may be.'</p>
<p>In a moment the house was surrounded by Cesare's men-at-arms.
The door crashed inwards under the fierce blows of halberds, and
the soldiers went in to take the assassins, whilst Cesare pushed on
towards the open square before the citadel, all pouring after him,
courtiers, grooms and people, in a vociferous disorder.</p>
<p>Before the citadel Cesare drew rein, and his halberdiers cleared
a space, and with their long pikes held horizontally formed a
barrier against the surging human tide. Other men-at-arms coming
presently down the street clove through the press, flinging the mob
in waves on either side of them. In their midst these pikemen
brought five prisoners taken in that house from which death had
been launched upon Prince Sinibaldi.</p>
<p>The captives were dragged forward, amid the furious execrations
of the people, into that open space which the halberdiers had
cleared, and so brought before the Duke, who stood there waiting to
deal out summary justice. Beside him on his mule, bewildered, pale
and flabby, was Messer Capello, retained by Cesare, since as the
only remaining representative of Venice it concerned him to witness
this matter to its end.</p>
<p>He was a dull fellow, this Orator, and it is to be doubted
whether he had any explanation of the truth until he had looked
into the faces of those five wretches whom the men-at-arms now
thrust forward into the Duke's awful presence. It was now, at last,
I think, that he understood that Sinibaldi had been mistaken for
the Duke and had received in his treacherous brain the bolt
intended for Valentinois. Swift upon that realization followed an
obvious suspicion. Had the Duke so intended it? Had Cesare Borgia
deliberately planned that there should be this mistake? Was it to
this end that he had arrayed Sinibaldi in the tiger-skin cloak and
ducal cap and set him to ride upon his own charger?</p>
<p>Conviction settled upon Messer Capello; conviction and rage at
the manner in which the Duke had fooled them and turned the tables
upon Sinibaldi. But there was yet the Most Serene to be reckoned
with, and the Most Serene would know how to avenge the death of her
envoy; heavy indeed should be the reckoning the Republic would
present.</p>
<p>In his rage Messer Capello swung round, threats already on his
lips, his arm flung out to give them emphasis. But ere he could
speak Cesare had caught by the wrist that out-flung arm of his and
held it as in a vice.</p>
<p>'Look,' he bade the envoy. 'Look, Messer Capello! Look at those
prisoners. There is my Lord Ranieri, who was the prince's host and
announced himself his friend&mdash;Ranieri of all men to have done
so foul a thing! And those other two, both of them professed
friends of Sinibaldi's, too.'</p>
<p>Capello looked as he was bidden, an incipient bewilderment
thrusting aside his sudden anger.</p>
<p>'And consider me yet those other two,' the Duke persisted, his
voice swelling with passion. 'Both of them in the prince's own
livery&mdash;his own familiars, his own servants whom no doubt he
trusted. Belike their treachery has been bought by these others,
these patrician assassins. To what black depths of villainy can man
descend!'</p>
<p>Capello stared at the Duke, almost beginning to believe him
sincere, so fervidly had he spoken. But, dull fellow though he was,
he was not so dull as to be hoodwinked now, nor did the Duke intend
it. Cesare desired him to know the truth, yet to know it
unuttered.</p>
<p>The Orator saw clear at last. And, seeing clear, he no longer
dared to speak the words that had been on his lips, lest by
implication they should convict the dead Sinibaldi, and so bring
Capello himself under the wrath of the Ten of Venice. He saw it
crystal clear that to proclaim that Sinibaldi had been slain in
Cesare's place were to proclaim that it was Sinibaldi&mdash;and so,
presumably, the Most Serene itself&mdash;that had planned the
murder, since all those taken were Sinibaldi's friends and
servants.</p>
<p>Capello, looking into the Duke's eyes, understood at last that
the Duke mocked him. He writhed in a boiling wrath that he must for
his own sake repress. But that was not all. He was forced to drain
to its very dregs the poisonous cup that Cesare had thrust upon
him. He was forced to play the dupe; to pretend that he saw in this
affair no more than Cesare intended that the world at large should
see; to pretend to agree that Sinibaldi had been basely murdered by
his friends and servants, and to leave it there.</p>
<p>Swallowing as best he could his rage, he hung his head.</p>
<p>'My lord,' he cried so that all might hear him, 'I appeal to you
for justice against these murderers in the name of Venice!'</p>
<p>Thus through the lips of her ambassador, Venice herself was
forced to disown these friends of hers&mdash;Ranieri and his
fellows&mdash;and demand their death at the hands of the man whom
she had hired them to slay. The tragic irony of it stabbed the
Orator through and through, the rage begotten of it almost
suffocated him, and was ever afterwards with him all his life to
inform his pen when he wrote aught that concerned the House of
Borgia.</p>
<p>And Cesare, appreciating the irony no less, smiled terribly into
the eyes of the ineffable Capello, as he made answer:</p>
<p>'Trust me to avenge this offence against the Most Serene as
fully as though it were an offence against myself.'</p>
<p>My Lord Ranieri thereupon shook himself out of the stupor that
had numbed his wits when he found Capello deserting and disowning
him.</p>
<p>'Magnificent!' he cried, straining forward in the hands that
held him, his face distorted with rage at Capello and Venice, whose
abandoned cat's-paw he now conceived himself. 'There is more in
this that you do not know. Hear me! Hear me first!'</p>
<p>Cesare advanced his horse a pace or two, so that he was directly
over the Lord Ranieri. Leaning slightly from his saddle, he looked
into the patrician's eyes much as he had looked into Capello's.</p>
<p>'There is no need to hear you,' he said. 'You can tell me
nothing that I do not know. Go get you shriven. I will send the
hangman for you at dawn.'</p>
<p>He wheeled about, summoned his cavaliers and ladies, his grooms
and his guards, and so rode ahead of that procession over the
drawbridge into the great Citadel of Sigismondo.</p>
<p>The first citizens about the streets of Rimini upon the morrow
beheld in the pale wintry light of that 2
November&mdash;appropriately the Day of the Dead&mdash;five bodies
dangling limply from the balcony of the house whence the bolts had
been shot&mdash;the justice of the Duke of Valentinois upon the
murderers of Prince Sinibaldi!</p>
<p>Cesare Borgia himself paused to survey those bodies a little
later, when he passed by with his armed multitudes, quitting Rimini
in all the panoply of war to march against the Manfredi of Faenza.
The subtlety of his vengeance pleased him. It was lightened by a
vein of grim humour that he savoured with relish, thinking of the
consternation and discomfiture of the Ten when they should come to
hear of it, as hear of it they would in detail from their
Orator.</p>
<p>But the cream of the jest was yet to come. It followed a week
later at Forli, where the Duke had paused to assemble his condotte
for the investment of Faenza.</p>
<p>Thither came Capello, seeking audience on behalf of the Council
of Ten. He was the bearer of a letter in which the Most Serene
Republic expressed to the Duke's magnificence her thanks for the
summary justice he had measured out to the murderers of their
beloved Prince Sinibaldi.</p>
<p>That pleased Valentinois, and it pleased him no less to reflect
that he had faithfully kept the letter of his promise to
Sinibaldi's lady, and that neither he nor any man of his had so
much as laid a finger upon Sinibaldi to avenge the latter's
plotting against himself. There was humour in that, too.</p>
