<p align="center">NOTE<br>
<br>
Realising that the incidents dealt with in Chapters 14 and 16 may appear
to transcend those bounds of reasonable possibility to which fiction should
be confined, the author considers it necessary to say that these incidents
are not merely founded upon fact, but follow fact extremely closely.<br>
<br>
For parallel happenings the doubting reader is referred to The Flying Post,
December 11/13/1707, which contains an account of the strange case of John
Smith, and to Plot&#8217;s Natural History of Oxfordshire (pages 197 and 199),
where accounts will be found of two cases still more remarkable. &mdash; R. S.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>Chapter 1. THE PLAYERS</h2>
<p>The room&mdash;somewhat disordered now, at the end of that long
night's play&mdash;was spacious, lofty and handsomely equipped. On a
boldly carved, walnut side table of Dutch origin there was a
disarray of glasses, bottles, plates and broken meats. From a
mahogany wine cooler beneath this table's arched legs sprouted the
corkless necks of a half-score empty bottles. About the card-table
in the room's middle stood irregularly some eight or ten chairs,
lately occupied by the now departed players. One overturned chair
lay neglected where it had fallen. Cards were still strewn upon the
table's cover of green baize and some few lay scattered on the
scarlet Turkey rug that covered a square of the blocked and
polished floor.</p>
<p>Overhead in the heavy chandelier of ormolu and crystal the
candles were guttering, caught by the draught from one of the long
French windows which his lordship had just opened. In the gap he
stood, gazing out into the chill grey dawn and the wraiths of mist
that hung above the park.</p>
<p>By the carved overmantel, his shoulders to the shelf and the
ormolu timepiece, which marked now the hour of three, stood Lord
Pauncefort's only lingering and most important guest. He was a man
of rather more than middle height, slender as a rapier is slender,
of a steely, supple strength. He was simply yet very elegantly
dressed in black, relieved only by the silver embroidery on his
stockings, the paste buckles that flashed from his lacquered,
red-heeled shoes, and the lace at his throat, among which a great
sapphire glowed with sombre fire. Enough remained, however, in his
erect carriage, his Steinkirk, the clubbing of his hair and the
bronze of his face to advertise the soldier.</p>
<p>His keen blue eyes were upon the figure of his host, and in them
was reflected the faint smile that softened the somewhat hard lines
of his mouth. Yet the smile was scornful&mdash;of his host and of the
night that was sped; scornful and something sad.</p>
<p>Was it, he mused, upon such as these that his king and master
relied in his dire need? Was it to gain such support as my lord
Pauncefort and his precious friends could offer to that desperate
cause that he, himself, had ventured once more into England where a
thousand guineas was offered for his head?</p>
<p>The play, he reflected contemptuously, they had urged as a wise
measure of precaution: let them do their plotting about a
faro-table, had been their plea; thus they should pass for a parcel
of idle gamesters, and none could dream that the game was a
pretence, a mere mask upon their real business. Thus had they
deluded themselves, but not him. He had seen, and soon, that the
plotting was the pretence, and play the business. And what play! A
gamester all his life, a man who had beggared himself a score of
times in twenty different lands, never had he known such stakes as
those which had been laid that night, never had he seen such sums
change hands across the green baize of a card table.</p>
<p>He checked the contemptuous current of his thoughts to reflect
that he himself had plunged as headlong as the most reckless of
them into the game that was afoot. Had he not won a fortune 'twixt
the commencement and the abandoning of that monstrous play? His
winnings amounted to something over ten thousand guineas, and at no
one time in his vagrant, adventurous life had he been master of
half that sum. Yet it did not follow that he was quite as they. If
he had risked that night certain moneys that he scarce dared call
his own, so did he hesitate to call his own the vast sum which he
had won.</p>
<p>Ten thousand guineas! Ten times the value set by the Government
upon his own poor head, he reflected whimsically.</p>
<p>And then Lord Pauncefort turned from the window and the sight of
his lordship's livid, distorted countenance drove all other
considerations from his guest's mind, brought a sudden cry of
concern from his lips.</p>
<p>"My lord, are you ill?"</p>
<p>His lordship made a gesture of denial. "It&mdash;it is not that," he
said, and his voice was husky with emotion. He was a man of some
thirty years of age, of a swarthy male beauty that was almost
arresting. His large eyes were dark and liquid, his mouth
delicately limned, his nose intrepidly arched, with fine sensitive
nostrils. But the brow was alarmingly shallow and there was a cleft
in the square&mdash;the too square&mdash;chin. He stood now, dabbing his
moist brow with a flimsy kerchief that was not whiter than the hand
that held it.</p>
<p>"Captain Gaynor," he explained abruptly, almost fiercely, "I am
a broken man. I have ruined myself this night."</p>
<p>There was scarce one of the departed guests, Captain Gaynor
bethought him, who had not left that house a winner, and in all his
lordship's losses must amount to almost twice the sum of the
Captain's winnings.</p>
<p>None the less, his lordship's outcry jarred upon the Captain's
nice sensibilities. Such an admission made to one who was a heavy
winner&mdash;and that one none so intimately admitted to his lordship's
private confidences, when all was said&mdash;seemed to Captain Gaynor an
outrage on decorum. He held that the man who cannot lose with calm
and grace, no matter what the game or what the stakes&mdash;even though
it should be life itself&mdash;has not the right to enter into play. And
this was no abstract creed. It was the one by which the Captain
lived.</p>
<p>The sight of the stricken man before him moved him to no
pity.</p>
<p>Rather it inspired in him a contempt that amounted almost to
physical ill being, to disgust. His immediate impulse was to take
his leave. If, indeed, he had lingered at all after the departure
of his fellow-guests, it had been in the hope that my Lord
Pauncefort might yet have something for his private ear concerning
the real business that had brought him to England and to that
house. And perceiving now how idle had been this hope, observing
his host's suddenly altered condition, Captain Gaynor's inclination
was to depart.</p>
<p>But he reflected that to depart abruptly after that confession
might be to offend. On his own account this would have troubled the
Captain not at all. But for the Cause's sake, and for the sake of
the service it might be Pauncefort's to render to that Cause, he
did not wish to give offence to his host if it might be avoided. He
was in a quandary, and vexed thereby; for quandaries were not usual
in the life of this man who lived by swift decisions and swift
action.</p>
<p>He shifted uneasily where he stood, and his face assumed a mask
of polite concern. His lordship had sunk into the nearest chair,
like a man wearied to exhaustion. There was a wildness in his eyes,
and he continued nervously to dab his brow&mdash;that brow whose
shallowness belied the general nobility of his countenance.</p>
<p>"You think, maybe, that I exaggerate," he resumed presently.
"But I tell you, sir, that I have played the knave this night. I
have lost four thousand guineas to Martindale, another two to
Bagshot, and I have lost my honour too, for I have forfeited all
chance of ever being able to pay those losses."</p>
<p>The concern in the Captain's face appeared to deepen.</p>
<p>"They are your friends," he said slowly. "Surely they will be
glad to wait upon your convenience." In his own breast pocket
rested his lordship's draft upon his bankers for the eight thousand
and odd guineas he had lost to the Captain.</p>
<p>"My convenience?" cried Pauncefort, and his white face writhed
in a spasm of mocking laughter. "I tell you, man, that in all the
world I cannot claim ten guineas for my own. You are a gamester,
Captain Gaynor?" he ended between question and assertion.</p>
<p>"So rumour says of me&mdash;I confess with justice," the Captain
admitted, and the faintest of ironic smiles quivered on his firm
lips.</p>
<p>"I am engaged at present in a game wherein I have staked my
head. Has your lordship ever played as deep as that?"</p>
<p>"Ay, have I. Do I not tell you, man, that I have staked my
honour; and honour, surely, is more than life."</p>
<p>"So I have heard say," answered Captain Gaynor, like a
sceptic.</p>
<p>He had little comfort for his host, little encouragement for the
confidences that Pauncefort insisted upon thrusting on him. Indeed,
it was his deliberate aim to stifle them. He desired them not.
Although his acquaintance with Lord Pauncefort was considerable, it
was not an acquaintance that had ever ripened, or promised to
ripen, into friendship. The link that bound them was their common
devotion to the Stuart Cause, whose agent Captain Gaynor was.
Beyond that they had no common interest, although, when all is
said, that might be accounted interest enough to bind two men at
such a time.</p>
<p>But, despite the Captain's chill aloofness, his lordship was not
to be repressed. In the nature of this man of so strong and
noble-seeming a countenance there was a strain of weakness almost
feminine. He was of those who must forever be proclaiming griefs
and grievances, finding it impossible to bear in silence and in
dignity the burden of their woes. He was of those who in their
trouble must forever be confiding in the hope of lessening their
oppression. Moreover he had at present another motive for his
confidence: a faint hope that it might bear him fruit, as you shall
see.</p>
<p>"Listen," he said, and upon the heels of that exhortation
swiftly poured out the tale of his condition. "I was broke six
months ago, when the South-Sea Bubble was pricked. I gambled
heavily in the stock and, like many another, woke one morning to
find that a fortune had melted in my hands. This rascally Whig
Government&mdash;" He was beginning upon a side issue, when he broke off
abruptly to return to his main theme. "To buy that stock I raised
heavy mortgages. I raised still more to clear myself after that
cataclysm, and I mortgaged what was left to recoup my losses.
Instead&mdash;But there! Tonight I played for my immediate needs. I
played to twice the extent of the losses I could meet, and in that
I played the knave. But my need was very urgent, Captain. Now&mdash;it
is over." He dabbed his brow again. His voice grew calmer with the
dead calm of despair. "If I have the courage to be alive by noon
tomorrow, the spunging-house awaits me." He shivered in his
splendid garments, and the jewelled buttons of his salmon-coloured
waistcoat twinkled roguishly as if conscious of the irony of their
presence in the apparel of a pauper.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor stood considering a moment, the expression&mdash;the
mask&mdash;of studied concern upon his face, increasing contempt and
disgust in his heart.</p>
<p>Was it upon such men as this that his master counted? And he
recalled the eulogistic words in which his prince had spoken of
this adherent.</p>
<p>"Pauncefort is powerful and loyal," he had said. "He is ours
body and soul and to the last penny of his fortunes."</p>
<p>That was the dream of that august man of dreams. Here,
confronting Captain Gaynor, was the reality&mdash;a broken gamester who
whimpered over his losses.</p>
<p>"Surely, surely," said the soldier slowly, "there is one thing
you have forgot."</p>
<p>Pauncefort looked up quickly, his black brows contracting. "If
it be aught I can raise money upon, in God's name tell it me
quickly," said he, with a wry smile.</p>
<p>"I think it is," replied the Captain. "You have forgot Miss
Hollinstone."</p>
<p>The contraction of his lordship's brows grew heavier still, and
the fine countenance assumed a something of haughtiness and of
challenge. Undeterred Captain Gaynor proceeded to make plain his
meaning.</p>
<p>"Your betrothal to Damaris Hollinstone is known to all the
world, just as it is also known that she is the wealthiest heiress
in England, mistress of a fortune that is colossal. Surely, sir,
with such a prospect before you, your creditors&mdash;"</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a sharp laugh.</p>
<p>"You have had no dealings, sir, with the tribe of Judah. That is
plain," said his lordship bitterly. "Oh, be very sure that I have
attempted it&mdash;to be met with veiled derision and open insolence.
You do not know the Jew. You do not know the hatred of the
Christian that underlies his dealings, the vampire spirit that
actuates him. Shakespeare, sir, knew his nature when he limned his
Shylock."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," suggested Captain Gaynor, "the Christian has deserved
no better at his hands."</p>
<p>It was a point of view so revolutionary, so subversive of all
the notions upon which Lord Pauncefort had been bred, that for a
moment it drove every other consideration from his mind, leaving
his face blank with astonishment. But his own affairs swept back
upon him in an instant to turn him from any disputing upon so wild
a matter.</p>
<p>"You are a gamester, Captain Gaynor, and all gamesters are prone
to come to such a state as mine tonight. Let me give&mdash;it is all
that remains me to bestow on anyone&mdash;a piece of advice upon the
subtle art of raising money. See to it ever in such affairs that
betimes you raise at least twice as much as you can ever repay out
of your own resources. Then your creditors, for their own purses'
sakes, will afford you every opportunity; they will handle you
tenderly; they will nurse you with care; they will watch over you
as never mother watched her babe at its first steps.</p>
<p>"Had I but had such advice given me and acted upon it, I should
not be in such case as this in which you find me. Money would have
flowed freely to my hands upon the prospect of my marriage, because
upon the consummation of that would have depended my creditors'
reimbursement. As it is, sir, I have fallen into the error of
borrowing no more than my estates can bear.</p>
<p>"The chief of my creditors is a Spanish Jew, one Israel Suarez,
an evil rogue of fabulous wealth and destitute of mercy; one who
seems to draw a Satanic joy from the torturing and breaking of such
men as I. I tell you, Captain Gaynor, that I have abased myself to
plead with him. I have besought him in terms I cannot recall
without shame that if he will not concede me a loan upon my
marriage prospects, at least to postpone his demand for settlement
of my present debts until my marriage shall have taken place.</p>
<p>"My intercessions have been met with the sneers and insolent
jests of this usurious dog. He holds my mortgages for everything
that is not in the entail. That almost covers my debt to him. The
balance he will recover from the interest on the entailed estates
what time I am rotting in a debtors' gaol. Frankly he tells me
this&mdash;that since he can retrieve his own he will run no risks. And
so, tomorrow&mdash;" He spread his hands, shrugged, and sank back
scowling again into his chair.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor understood, but he answered nothing. What answer
could he make? He looked towards the windows, which were glowing
now like moonstones in the increasing light. Again he thought of
going, and vaguely he wondered why Lord Pauncefort should have
chosen him for these confidences. He conceived that it was
fortuitous&mdash;the result of his having lingered after the others had
departed. But in his lordship's next words he had the correct
answer to his unspoken question.</p>
<p>"Had I refrained tonight," his lordship was saying presently in
a small unsteady voice, his fingers plucking nervously at a card
which he had picked up from the floor, "all might yet have been
well. By meeting a bill that is due tomorrow I might temporarily
have satisfied the demands of that foul vulture, Suarez. I should
have gained time, and with time salvation might have come. I have
sunk money in a trading venture which may yet repay me. But for
this, time is needed; time and&mdash;and the money I have lost tonight.
I held it in readiness for this, but the cursed cards&mdash;"</p>
<p>He broke off with a bitter oath. But he had said enough. It
would have been impossible to have asked more plainly for the help
that it was in Gaynor's power to render him.</p>
<p>The Captain understood at last the reason of these
confidences.</p>
<p>Understanding brought with it some pity and more contempt. I
fear me his nature was a little hard. He spoke out plainly, his
voice crisp.</p>
<p>"You are inviting me, my lord, to return you this," he said, and
from his breast pocket he took Lord Pauncefort's draft upon his
bankers.</p>
<p>He was, as I have said, a man of swift decisions, and here he
had decided swiftly, but not at all as his host conceived.</p>
<p>Pauncefort threw back his head under the goad of that voice. It
seemed to him that it conveyed a deadly insult. For all that the
matter was true enough; the manner could not, he thought, have been
more outrageous.</p>
<p>"Sir!" said he, with a very frosty dignity, and upon the word he
rose, frowning darkly. "Sir, you affront me."</p>
<p>"Forgive me," answered the soldier gently "Such was not my
intent." He replaced the draft in his pocket. "And yet," he sighed;
"I conceived that I saw a way to assist you."</p>
<p>The unexpectedness of this withdrawal scattered his lordship's
fine dignity to the murmuring winds of dawn. His jaw dropped in
sheer astonishment; his eyes stared foolishly; the card he had held
fluttered from his nerveless fingers. He leaned against the table,
and looked at his guest.</p>
<p>"Perhaps ..." he said, faltering on the word, "perhaps my
refusal was churlish."</p>
<p>"I understand it," said Gaynor quietly But behind his
imperturbable mask he was laughing at his lordship.</p>
<p>"When all is said," the other resumed, "if you could&mdash;if I might
so far trespass upon your patience and you would wait until a more
convenient season&mdash;"</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor took him up at once. "Wait?" he echoed, and he
frowned thoughtfully "Wait?" He laughed, a little laugh that was
singularly pleasant despite the tinge of irony that invested it.
"Ye have indeed mistook me," he said.</p>
<p>"How?" quoth his lordship, flung back once more upon his
dignity.</p>
<p>"Faith," said the Captain, "you'll agree, I think, that I am in
little case to wait. If it please me to gamble upon my own life it
does not please me that others should do the same&mdash;leastways
without ever a stake set against so very valuable a property You
forget, my lord" (and instinctively he lowered his voice), "a
thousand guineas is the advertised value of this head of mine. At
any moment that value may be claimed. In England here I walk amid
drawn swords. If I consented to do your pleasure in this matter, at
any moment one of these might liquidate the debt." He laughed
again. "It is a game in which the odds are much too heavy in your
favour, and, moreover, a game in which you adventure nothing."</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I had not considered that," his lordship exclaimed with
earnestness. "'Pon honour, I had not."</p>
<p>"I do not do you the injustice to suppose it. But consider it
now, I beg."</p>
<p>"I do. I thank you for enlightening me." He stood erect, his
handsome face pale but quite composed. "Captain Gaynor, there is no
more to be said."</p>
<p>"Nay, now, I think there is," returned the other, smiling
quietly.</p>
<p>"I do not understand."</p>
<p>"Pray consider further. I am a gamester, as you have said, as
every soldier of fortune is perforce. And being poor in point of
worldly goods, my life is a stake for which I am well used to
playing. Out of consideration for your straits, I will permit that
you too play, as it were, upon it and for this eight thousand
guineas that I have won. But you must set a stake against it, my
lord&mdash;and a heavy one to balance all the odds that are in your
favour."</p>
<p>He spoke quietly, his face so calm, his glance so steady that
none might have suspected the excitement within. Lord Pauncefort
stared and stared. At length&mdash;"I have talked in vain, it seems,"
said he. "Yet I have told you plainly that I cannot claim so much
as ten guineas for my own. What, then, have I to stake?"</p>
<p>"Something that is hardly yours," came the gentle answer, "and
something which, if I win from you, I shall yet have to win another
way and may altogether fail to win." He smiled a wry smile, his
steely eyes upon the other's face. "You perceive, my lord, that the
odds are all with you. It cannot be said that I lack generosity in
the risks I take."</p>
<p>"I do not understand you," said his lordship bluntly. "What
stake have you in mind?"</p>
<p>There was a perceptible pause before the soldier answered
him.</p>
<p>He squared his shoulders; his face became set and stern; his
glance flickered a moment to the windows and the dawn, which, from
the pallor of the moonstone, was warming now to opalescent fires.
Then his eyes returned to Lord Pauncefort's impatient questioning
face.</p>
<p>"Damaris Hollinstone," he said quietly.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>Chapter 2. THE GAME</h2>
<p>Lord Pauncefort fell back a pace, as if before a blow. The
reflections of a surge of feelings from astonishment through
contempt to positive anger sped across his heavily featured face.
He leaned against the card-table and surveyed his guest with eyes
that from their first gape of surprise came to blaze with
unmistakable malevolence.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor, cool, erect, with something of defiance in his
mien, waited patiently until his lordship should choose to break
the brooding silence. At length came a little sneering laugh from
the viscount, and on its heels the sneering words: "Blister me! You
play strange games, Captain Gaynor."</p>
<p>"It is true," Gaynor admitted, "and," he added, stung a little,
"with strange players sometimes. You will admit at least my
generosity in the matter of the odds?"</p>
<p>"Fore gad, yes!" the other exploded in a storm of contempt. "I
am glad ye have the grace to admit it."</p>
<p>"I have never lacked for grace," said the Captain complacently
His lordship struck the table with his clenched hand. "Let us
understand each other," he demanded savagely.</p>
<p>"'Tis what I most desire."</p>
<p>"In a word then: What is Miss Hollinstone to you?"</p>
<p>"In a word, my lord&mdash;nothing."</p>
<p>"Nothing? Nothing? And yet you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Spare me your jealousy, I pray," the soldier interrupted, and
ran on undismayed by the other's haughty frown: "There is no need
for it here. I have never so much as set eyes upon Miss
Hollinstone. You see in me no rival for the lady's affections. I
know not whether she be tall or short, fair or dark, fat or lean. I
know her as the greatest heiress in these islands&mdash;a lady of
surpassing wealth. I know her in no other way and in no other way
do I desire to know her."</p>
<p>The contempt, the disgust on the nobleman's face was
overwhelming.</p>
<p>"By God, Captain Gaynor!" he cried, in a voice thick with
passion, "I have welcomed you to my house. I have sat at table with
you. I have deemed you a gentleman."</p>
<p>"Ah! And you find me?" quoth the Captain, entirely unruffled,
yet with a challenging note in the question. But the other answered
him undeterred. "I find you a&mdash;a jackal. You have spoken of
yourself as an adventurer, a soldier of fortune. I did not dream
what depths of degradation the term could imply. You have put an
affront upon me in making me this proposal. 'Twas to consider me
your equal in baseness. It is an insult for which you shall give me
satisfaction. Fore gad, you shall!"</p>
<p>The soldier of fortune stood a little pale before that
onslaught. His lips were set, and in his steely eyes there was a
cold glitter before which men of bigger heart than Pauncefort had
quailed in their time. He moved at length from his position before
the empty fireplace, and sauntered, a graceful, supple figure, to
the windows. There he stood a moment gazing out upon the breaking
day, what time his host's eyes followed him, angry and
impatient.</p>
<p>The Captain was revolving something in his mind, debating
something eminently distasteful. It went against his wayward,
imperious nature to explain himself to any man. Many had
misunderstood his motives aforetime; and he had left them in a
misunderstanding, for which they had not infrequently paid
dearly.</p>
<p>Yet here was a man whom that night's business had taught him to
despise, and he found himself urged to offer explanations of his
conduct to such a man. It was repugnant to him; yet it must be done
if he were to have his way in this, if he were to carry through
this thing upon which, with his characteristic swiftness, he had
determined.</p>
<p>He turned at last, and with his back to the window he faced his
host.</p>
<p>"If I apprehend you aright, my lord," said he, and the calm and
dignity of his voice and mien, the force of his singularly
compelling personality, impressed the other into lending him an ear
notwithstanding the disgust and impatience that possessed him, "if
I apprehend you aright it is not with my proposal so much as with
my motives that you quarrel. If I had been able to say to you, 'I
love Miss Hollinstone,' you would have viewed my proposal
differently?"</p>
<p>His lordship flung out an arm in anger. "Perhaps," he rasped.
"What matter?"</p>
<p>"Oh! A deal," replied the other. "Had I been able to say that,
then, indeed, would my proposal have been base and ignoble; then,
indeed, would you have been right to deem yourself affronted and to
demand of me satisfaction. You are surprised at my point of view,
my lord? I do not think we are like to see eye to eye in many
things; but I would you could see eye to eye with me in this, that
you could understand&mdash;as you are very far from doing&mdash;the true
motives out of which I am acting."</p>
<p>Lord Pauncefort bowed, not without irony. "Proceed, sir," he
invited his guest. "If anything you can say will mitigate the
judgment I have formed&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I care nothing for your judgments, my lord," came the sharp,
almost passionate interruption. "When men have lived such lives as
mine, believe me, they are very far from being touched by the
judgments of those whose lives have been smooth and sheltered. In
all this world there is but one thing I care for, one Cause in
which were I not prepared to lay down my life tomorrow I should not
be tonight in England. None knows that better than your lordship.
If I have a hope of personal fortune, it is a remote and distant
hope, to follow upon, as it is bound up with, the fortune of
another. For ten years have I waited, acquiring knowledge in
foreign service, steeling and tempering myself for the great
service that is to come. I am in the twenty-ninth year of my age;
the first flush of my youth is over, spent without regrets,
consecrated like a novitiate to fit me for my task. The cup of
youth's pleasures is one that my lips have never touched. The love
of woman has passed me by. The money that has come to me in the
course of services that I have hired to others has gone, most of
it, to the Cause on which my heart is set. If it please Almighty
God that my hopes bear fruit, that my labours yield return, I shall
have my reward and I shall rest me at last. If not," and a shadow
crossed the face and dimmed the almost fanatical glow of the blue
eyes, "I shall still have my reward within myself&mdash;in the glory of
the memory of the service rendered to that exiled one in Rome.</p>
<p>"You know of whom I speak, my lord, to what service I refer.
Tonight I sat down to play here with money that I scarce dared call
my own. Had I lost, it would have been so much lost to the Cause;
as I have won, it is but just that I count it still money to be
devoted to this sacred enterprise; and under no circumstances, sir,
would my honour have permitted me, as for a moment you supposed, to
return you the draft and await a convenience that may never
come.</p>
<p>"My lord, you know full well that our Cause is most desperately
in need of funds. His Majesty lives almost upon charity." There was
something akin to a sob in his voice. "Think of it, my lord! You
count yourself one of his servants, one of his loyal adherents. You
plot and scheme and pray for his return because you believe and are
loyal to the rightful king. Can you, then, contemplate his
straitened circumstances without feeling yourself humbled and
ashamed? Consider how the money you have dissipated here&mdash;"</p>
<p>He broke off suddenly. "But let that be! I am speaking of
myself, I think. I have said that this money I have won from you I
scarce consider mine. Yet will I adventure it again as I adventured
that other. I will adventure it to win more&mdash;to win the fortune of
Miss Hollinstone, that I may turn it to a like sacred purpose.</p>
<p>"Now, sir," he ended abruptly, "you are informed of the precise
height and depth of my baseness; you have the precise measure of
the insult I have offered you." And he turned again to the window
swiftly, that the other should not see the scalding tears that
welled to his eyes, man of iron though he was.</p>
<p>My lord sank to a chair and took his head in his hands, beaten
down by the storm of that man's fervour&mdash;that man whom he had
dubbed in scorn and disgust a self-seeking fortune hunter.</p>
<p>Something of the soldier's enthusiasm had stirred him, and in
its wake had come a burning, searing shame at the reflection of
what were Gaynor's motives, what his own. The small voice of his
conscience whispered mockingly that it was he was the fortune
hunter, he that was vile and base, he that, without faith or
loyalty, had lent himself to a cause whose prevailing was his
forlorn hope, the last perceptible means by which to mend his
shattered fortunes.</p>
<p>"Captain Gaynor," he said at last, in a hushed voice, "I ask
your pardon for my misapprehension of you."</p>
<p>The Captain swung round and faced him again&mdash;master of himself
once more, calm and self-contained.</p>
<p>"Is it your pleasure, then, that we play?" he asked.</p>
<p>But here his lordship's face again grew dark, reflecting
thoughts of which the soldier could have no knowledge, else he
would not have insisted as he did.</p>
<p>"Consider, my lord," he cried, "that all the odds are on your
side. On the one hand you stand to win; on the other, to lose
nothing that is not lost already."</p>
<p>My lord threw up his head, something between amazement and anger
in his eyes. "How?" he cried with extraordinary vehemence. "What
is't you mean?"</p>
<p>To himself Captain Gaynor cursed the fellow's dullness. He
proceeded to explain.</p>
<p>"You have said that, unless you have this money tomorrow, a
debtors' gaol awaits you. In such a case will not Miss Hollinstone
be lost to you? Do you dream that her uncle and guardian, Sir John
Kynaston, will permit this betrothal to continue? It is your only
chance that I am offering you, my lord. For your own sake, no less
than for mine, you should consent."</p>
<p>It was so clear and plain that Pauncefort for a moment turned
the notion over in his mind, and something else&mdash;a further
unsuspected advantage that must lie with him in such a game, an
advantage, indeed, which made a mock of it and himself no better
than a cheat did he consent. He frowned in doubt and perplexity.
The perplexity he voiced at last.</p>
<p>"How do you look to profit by my loss?" he asked.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor considered a moment. He came forward and leaned
upon the table opposite to his lordship.</p>
<p>"The conquest of a woman so wounded in her pride and vanity
should not be an insuperable task. Under the urge of pique she may
welcome a suitor who at another time might be disdained. That is my
opportunity; none so great, as you may judge; so that here again
the odds are all with you. Given the opportunity, however, I am not
unpersonable; I have seen the world, and I could no doubt, upon
occasion, develop the antics which delight a woman." He spoke quite
coldly. "For the rest, not only is her uncle on our side, not only
does he expect me at Priory Close on Thursday, but he holds me in
some affection; so that the way lies open to me."</p>
<p>"You speak of wounds to her pride and vanity."</p>
<p>"Those consequent upon your lordship's withdrawal of your suit,"
said Captain Gaynor crisply, his steely eyes full upon the
other's.</p>
<p>But his lordship was not dominated by the glance. He smote the
table with his clenched hand. "No!" he roared. "Sink me into
perdition, no!"</p>
<p>It was a cry of conscience; the repudiation which common honesty
demanded. But Captain Gaynor rated it at a still higher value.
Slightly he inclined his head. He spread his hands a little. "Be it
so," said he. "We will say no more. I think, with your permission,
I will take my leave. The sun is rising."</p>
<p>But the alternative gaped before Pauncefort like a yawning chasm
upon whose brink he tottered. He clutched the soldier's sleeve.</p>
<p>"Stay!" he cried. "When a man has lost all else, what matters
honour?"</p>
<p>"There are some causes to which one may sacrifice honour and
remain honourable. You will remember that should I win, and should
all speed thereafter as I desire it, you will have done the Cause
perhaps the best service that lay within your power."</p>
<p>"Should you win?" said the other. His face was ghastly. "Ah, but
should you lose&mdash;" He broke off abruptly. "How shall we play?"</p>
<p>"What would you propose?" quoth Captain Gaynor, controlling the
exultation that strained within him like a hound upon the
leash.</p>
<p>My lord rose, his dark face was almost sinister now. He passed a
white, jewelled hand over his long, cleft chin.</p>
<p>"Such a game as this," he said, "should be played, I think, with
other tools than dice or cards. Honour is here involved, and with
honour should go life as well."</p>
<p>"That," said the Captain composedly, "depends upon the point of
view, and you and I, my lord, again do not see eye to eye. I do not
count this game dishonouring, else you may be very sure I should
not engage in it."</p>
<p>"You do not&mdash;true!" His lordship winced as he realised the
difference, dependent upon their respective motives. "But you do
not think of me."</p>
<p>"If I did not," said Gaynor sweetly, "I should accept the game
with the tools you have in mind. But those, my lord, are the tools
of my trade, and they should place the advantage too heavily with
me."</p>
<p>He uttered it as a commonplace; there was no scintilla of
boastfulness in his cold statement of an irrefragable fact. His
lordship laughed, short and bitterly.</p>
<p>"In that case," said he, "we had better use the tools of mine."
And he gathered up the cards that were spread upon the table. "You
are, as you have insisted, the incarnation of generosity, Captain
Gaynor."</p>
<p>"I am glad that at last you begin to perceive it," said the
soldier amiably. "Shall it hang upon a single cut'" He placed my
lord's draft upon the table as he spoke.</p>
<p>His lordship glanced at it, and then at the soldier. "Will you
not give your generosity a free rein?" said he. "Will you not add
to that the other two thousand that you have won from my guests
tonight?"</p>
<p>Gaynor, masking his contempt, drew from his pocket another note
of hand and a heavy purse. These, too, he placed upon the
table.</p>
<p>"Shall I throw in my head as well?" he asked. "It is valued at a
thousand guineas."</p>
<p>Pauncefort looked at him with hostile eyes, resentful of the
sneer that underlay his words. "I am content," he said.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor smiled, took the cards from his lordship,
shuffled them with steady fingers and placed the pack upon the
table.</p>
<p>"A single cut," he repeated, and by a gesture invited his
lordship to go first.</p>
<p>The viscount put forth a shaking hand, cut, and displayed the
four of spades. His face turned ashen.</p>
<p>"Sink me!" he raged. "I was a fool to have consented! God knows
I have had proof enough that my luck is dead tonight."</p>
<p>The Captain made him no answer, but reaching for the pack cut in
his turn.</p>
<p>It was then that he gave his lordship the sorely needed lesson
in the art of graceful losing. He smiled and shook his head in
deprecation of his lordship's passion.</p>
<p>"You cursed your luck too soon, my lord," said he. He had cut
the three of diamonds.</p>
<p>As he walked along Jermyn Street, flooded now with the radiance
of the new-risen sun, he smiled pensively. The gods had given him a
wondrous chance and a little fortune of ten thousand pounds. He
pondered some of the things that might have been accomplished with
that sum. Then he dismissed the matter from his mind without
another regret.</p>
<p>He was by temperament, you see, the perfect gamester.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>Chapter 3. MR SECOND
SECRETARY</h2>
<p>However undeniable it may be that Captain Gaynor was a man
inured to danger and prepared to accept all risks that came his
way, yet it is no less undeniable that he never accepted a risk
that was unnecessary. Daring he was, but not reckless. The care and
precaution with which he laid his plans, the thought which he
devoted to their formulation and the elaborate pains he took in
their execution were all calculated to reduce his risk to the
lowest fraction. He overlooked nothing, neglected nothing, and
rarely moved into a situation from which he had not prepared
himself an avenue of retreat in the event of sudden danger.</p>
<p>As a result of all this, although the Government was aware of
the existence of a singularly daring Jacobite agent, who spied and
plotted, came and went between the Pretender's Court at Rome and
his adherents in England, and although the country was sown with
proclamations offering a thousand guineas for his apprehension, the
identity of this agent remained unknown. No definite description of
him existed; indeed, the descriptions forthcoming at various times
offered such glaring discrepancies one with another that it almost
seemed as if his exploits were not those of an individual, but of a
group.</p>
<p>He was generally known as "Captain Jenkyn" though none could say
how the sobriquet had arisen. As "Captain Jenkyn" he was referred
to in all reports concerning his movements which the Government
spies were from time to time enabled to lay before the Secretary of
State, and "Captain Jenkyn" was the name in those proclamations
which offered a thousand guineas for his head.</p>
<p>But no man who was not of the party&mdash;and only one or two who
were&mdash;had ever consciously come face to face with Captain Jenkyn.
On the day when that should happen, on the day when a Government
agent or emissary should hail him to his face by that nom de
guerre, on that day, he was resolved, he would sink his own
identity&mdash;cast it from him like a garment that has served its
turn&mdash;for the sake of the many whose connection with Captain Harry
Gaynor might be traced and whose lives might in consequence be
jeopardised. On that day his career as an agent would be at an end.
Even if with the mask plucked from him he should succeed in making
good his escape from the perils that would then surround him,
another must thereafter take up his work. Such was his resolve
against a contingency which the elaborate quality of his plans
permitted him to account remote.</p>
<p>It is in the perfection of these plans that towards noon of that
day whose dawn saw him departing from Pauncefort House we find the
Captain in one of the last places in London where we should look
for a man engaged upon such a mission as his own&mdash;in the anteroom
of Mr Second Secretary Templeton's residence in Old Palace
Yard.</p>
<p>Three months ago, in Rome, Captain Gaynor had renewed an old
acquaintance with one Sir Richard Tollemache Templeton, who had
served with him under Marlborough in the days of the late
Queen&mdash;days in which Harry Gaynor had been acquiring the rudiments
of the art by which he was to live. Since then Tollemache Templeton
had succeeded to the baronetcy, left the service, and was now
repairing an omission in his education by making the grand
tour.</p>
<p>Sir Richard was the Second Secretary's cousin, and Gaynor had
been quick to seize upon that circumstance, and upon their old
acquaintance, to provide against his forthcoming mission into
England. For a month he had flung in his lot with the lounging Sir
Richard. Together they had roamed over Southern Italy, the Captain
representing himself as a soldier of fortune out of work just then,
to whom time was of no account and upon whom the allurements of Sir
Richard's company proved compelling. He had very materially
improved the acquaintance between them during that month. It had
warmed and quickened into a friendship, very genuine on Sir
Richard's part, and only a little less so on the other's.</p>
<p>Most subtly had Captain Gaynor succeeded in conveying to the
baronet an entirely wrong conception of his aims. So cleverly,
indeed, had he done his work that in the end the suggestion which
it was his intention ultimately to make to Sir Richard, Sir Richard
actually made to him.</p>
<p>They were lounging together on the cliffs at Capri one
breathless, languid morning, when the Captain, by way of leading up
to what he had in mind, fell to bewailing the passing of the need
for the soldier of fortune in Europe. He deplored his own enforced
idleness; states were at peace; employment for such as himself was
not easily to be discovered; he had come hopefully to Italy,
looking for turbulence in the peninsula to afford him his
opportunity; but his hopes were proved vain; his purse was growing
lighter and no prospect showed upon the horizon; he spoke gloomily
of returning to the East, regretted almost having left it. Subtlest
of all was the last touch he added, and for the glaring untruth of
it the justification he offered to his conscience was the great
cause he served, the ultimate good to be achieved, if necessary, by
ignoble means.</p>
<p>"There is the Pretender, now," he said slowly, "and I have
thought of him. Indeed, he's all there's left to think of here. But
there is little to attract me in thought. I may be a follower of
Fortune's banner, a man who makes of fighting as much a trade as
others make of tinkering or haberdashery, but, on my soul, Dick,
there are limits even to that. The Pretender is the enemy of
England" (he prayed heaven to pardon him that necessary blasphemy),
"and Harry Gaynor's sword although for hire shall never be hired to
any disloyal cause." He sighed and laughed his musical,
self-mocking little laugh.</p>
<p>"I dare swear you'll count me foolish, Dick, to strain at a gnat
who have swallowed camels."</p>
<p>But Sir Richard's face was very grave; approval shone in his
frank eyes.</p>
<p>"On my soul I do not, Harry," he cried heartily, like the
thorough-paced Whig he was. "I honour you for your feelings. I
would not have a friend of mine hold any other. But," he continued,
frowning thoughtfully, "since you feel thus, why not let profit and
inclination jump together? Why not find employment for your sword
in the service that enlists your heart?"</p>
<p>The Captain's pulses throbbed a little faster. For here from Sir
Richard came the very proposal to which so warily he was leading.
But since Sir Richard had proposed it, Sir Richard should persuade
as well, and thus the thing would come to stand upon a still
sounder basis than ever Gaynor had hoped.</p>
<p>He laughed contemptuously.</p>
<p>"Why, Dick!" he cried, "what is't you suggest? What hire can
England offer for my services? Pshaw, man, 'tis not a land in which
the mercenary grows anything but lean."</p>
<p>"But there are the colonies," Sir Richard insisted, "and good
appointments are to be obtained there for her adventurous
children."</p>
<p>"The colonies?" said the Captain, in a different voice, the
voice of one who muses yieldingly. "True!" he murmured. And then,
as if brushing the matter aside: "But even there," he concluded,
"to obtain such posts as are worth the adventurer's attention,
influence, much influence, is needed."</p>
<p>"Some, I agree," answered Sir Richard. "And that I can
supply."</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor stared at him.</p>
<p>"You, Dick?" he cried, and laughed in mockery of his
companion.</p>
<p>"You forget that the Second Secretary is my cousin," Sir Richard
reminded him without resentment.</p>
<p>"Why!" exclaimed the Captain, like one upon whom bursts a sudden
revelation, one who discovers something hitherto entirely
overlooked, "why that is true! And you think, then&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know," Sir Richard cut in, "that what my cousin can he will
do for my friend. He shall do. I will write to him this very day,
and yourself shall bear the letter, Harry."</p>
<p>Thus it befell that the amiable Sir Richard penned his glowing
panegyric of Captain Gaynor. He delivered it to the adventurer,
urging him to start at once. But the Captain was not of those who
quit the moment they have gained their object, and thereby leave
behind them a suspicion of what their object may have been. He
lingered on a full fortnight in Sir Richard's company, as if
reluctant to be gone, and this in spite of Sir Richard's constant
urgings. Indeed, they came near to quarrelling over the matter more
than once, the baronet holding that the service he was rendering
was being lightly treated, the Captain grumbling daily that his
prospects, after all, were none so bright, that the English service
was a poor one at the best, that heaven alone knew how long he
might be left to cool his heels in British ante-chambers ere aught
was found for him; that he detested the English climate and had a
horror of ante-chambers, which were always draughty, and that he
could not abide draughts, being subject to the rheum ever since a
fever which had stricken him in Constantinople three years ago.</p>
<p>But in the end he went, though reluctant even then, and leaving
upon Sir Richard's mind the unmistakable impression that he
regretted having ever mentioned the matter and that he would not go
at all were it not out of dread of offending his dear friend by
failing to avail himself of that friend's good offices.</p>
<p>In his soul he was most excellently content. He knew this Second
Secretary Templeton, whom he had never met, as he knew every member
of the British Government and what each stood for. Templeton was
the very man for him: a man of little personal influence, no more
than the lackey and tool of my Lord Carteret, the Secretary of
State; a pompous, self-sufficient fellow who would promise much and
accomplish nothing, keeping the Captain hanging upon his promises
and thus affording him an excellent pretext for his sojourn in
England should it chance to he questioned. Thus, then, do we find
him amid the various clients in Mr Templeton's ante-chamber on that
fair June morning. Of the seven hours that are sped since he
departed from my Lord Pauncefort's house he has devoted six to
sleep, and he comes alert and fresh into the great man's
presence.</p>
<p>If last night there were about him indications of the soldier,
today his every line proclaims it. He wears a dark blue coat with
narrow silver lace, very full in the skirt, white buckskins and
jack-boots that are equipped with silver spurs. The hilt of his
sword is of cut steel; under his arm he carries a black hat looped
and plumed in military fashion, and the only jewel visible upon his
person is the sapphire nestling in the fine lace of his
Steinkirk.</p>
<p>His heels together, Captain Gaynor bowed stiffly and formally to
the Second Secretary. Mr Templeton did not consider it necessary to
rise to receive this visitor. He nodded to him across the littered
table at which he sat, nodded with the perfunctory nod of majesty,
whilst with an imperious yet languid hand he waved away the usher
who had introduced the soldier.</p>
<p>"You bring me, sir, I understand&mdash;ah&mdash;letters from my cousin,
Sir Richard&mdash;my cousin, Sir Richard." His voice was full and
sonorous, his utterance leisurely; his rhetorical tastes were
polysyllabic, and he had a trick, common to third-rate orators, of
repeating the closing words of a period.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor considered the long, sallow, aristocratic face
under its imposing, full-bottomed wig. He found it cold,
supercilious and somewhat forbidding; for it wore the expression
that Mr Templeton reserved for those who had aught to solicit from
him. All this, the Captain reflected, was as he would have it.</p>
<p>He produced his letter. Mr Templeton received it languidly.</p>
<p>"I think," said he, "that I am already&mdash;ah&mdash;acquainted with its
contents."</p>
<p>"Dick will no doubt have written to you direct, sir," said
Captain Gaynor easily.</p>
<p>Mr Templeton nodded shortly and broke the seal. This he did
elaborately, as he did all things, clothing himself like all
insignificant folk in a vast importance.</p>
<p>Thus&mdash;saving for certain orthographical eccentricities, whose
reproduction were unprofitable&mdash;had Sir Richard written:</p>
<blockquote>MY DEAR NED,&mdash;I send you these by the hand of one of my
oldest friends. Captain Harry Gaynor was my brother-in-arms
aforetime under Marlborough, and is a soldier of very high and
notorious merit. He has seen much service in many lands, and goes
now to offer his sword to the King, who has no more loyal devoted
subject than himself. His experience, whereupon he will himself
entertain you, entitles him, if I may presume to judge, to some
honourable post in his Majesty's dominions overseas. If you can
help him to his ambitions you will be serving me who matter little,
himself who matters more, and his most gracious Majesty who matters
most. Further still, you will be serving yourself, for I will
answer for it that to whatever post you may consider well to
appoint him he will do credit upon you for the appointment. As it
is for the most part in consequence of my representations to him
that Captain Gaynor is journeying to England to seek you, I hope
that you will find it in your power to accommodate him speedily and
suitably, and thus earn the gratitude of him who is, while he is,
your devoted and obedient cousin,<br>
<br>
RICHARD TOLLEMACHE TEMPLETON.</blockquote>
<p>The reading done, Mr Templeton levelled a quizzing-glass at the
soldier, and looked him over. He cleared his throat
ponderously.</p>
<p>"My cousin, sir, gives me here a very good account of you&mdash;a
very good account."</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor bowed in silence. "A fuller account is contained
in the other letter which I received from him," the statesman
added. Then after a slight pause, in an altered tone&mdash;a tone that
appeared to veil something&mdash;"I understand that you met my cousin in
Rome&mdash;in Rome," he said.</p>
<p>"That is so," replied the Captain.</p>
<p>"May I presume, sir, to inquire what you did there?"</p>
<p>"I perceive no presumption in the question." And Captain Gaynor
smiled affably. "I was idling there for some days being newly come
overseas from Turkey and still undetermined as to whither I should
turn my steps, where seek fresh service."</p>
<p>"You did not&mdash;ah&mdash;peradventure, consider offering your sword to
the Pretender?" And ere the Captain could answer him he had
added:</p>
<p>"You are a mercenary, Captain Gaynor&mdash;so I construe my cousin's
letter&mdash;and to a mercenary all services are&mdash;ah&mdash;one."</p>
<p>"Not quite, sir. The mercenary who accepts service against his
loyal sovereign is indeed a thing of scorn. A man may be a
mercenary, sir, and yet devoted to his king and country. Leastways,
such is the code I have ever followed. And that were cause enough
why I should not take my sword to the Pretender. But there was yet
another." A wry smile appeared upon his clean-cut face. "A
mercenary's aim is the trader's aim&mdash;profit, sir; and heaven knows
that in the Pretender's service there is no immediate and still
less future profit to be made. That, sir, should answer you."</p>
<p>It was the right note: the note of confidence in the present
Government; the note of contempt as to the prospects of the Stuart
cause, and the Captain was glad the opportunity had been given him
of striking it.</p>
<p>But the frigid, pompous mask before him did not relax, for all
that the great head nodded its solemn acceptance of the
statement.</p>
<p>"During your sojourn in the&mdash;ah&mdash;immortal city," said the
Secretary, "you would, I conceive, have gathered something of the
Court which the Pretender keeps?" He paused at that. But there was
a question in the phrase, a question which Captain Gaynor did not
for a moment misunderstand. He was being invited to produce what
information he might have gleaned. He was, I have said, a man of
swift decisions, and in the twinkling of an eye he weighed the
matter, and set his course. A man of nice sensibilities might have
affected to misunderstand the question, unwilling to play a part
that might savour, though remotely, of the spy's. But it would suit
him better to display no such niceness.</p>
<p>Therefore, he waxed voluble. He poured forth scraps of
information which he affected to have gathered here and there about
Rome: He plunged into a list of the Englishmen who were about the
person of the Stuart with all the air of one who is eager to
betray, that by betrayal he may curry favour. As he proceeded, the
mask of Mr Templeton's countenance warmed a little into life,
reflecting his expectancy; but when the Captain came to an end of
his disclosures that sombre countenance was cold once more. For
Captain Gaynor had betrayed no man that was not betrayed already,
had conveyed no single piece of information that was not already
the common property of the British Government and of every lounger
in town.</p>
<p>Mr Templeton told him so in blunt terms, whereupon his face fell
and he looked the picture of dejection for a moment. Then the
Second Secretary, considering him with a level eye, put a question
that turned the Captain's stout heart to ice: "Have you ever heard,
sir, of Captain Jenkyn?"</p>
<p>Taken unawares, his eyes dilated slightly. But the next instant
he was frowning thoughtfully. "Why&mdash;yes," said he. "An agent of the
Jacobites, is he not?"</p>
<p>"Ay, ay," rapped the other one impatiently. "What did you hear?
What did you hear?"</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor's fears were dispelled. Yet he wondered was there
some purpose more than general in the question, and he made an
answer that should test that point.</p>
<p>"Why, sir, I heard it said&mdash;I cannot call to mind by whom or in
what circumstances&mdash;but I heard it said that Captain Jenkyn was in
Rome preparing for a journey into England."</p>
<p>And then Mr Templeton betrayed the Government to Captain Gaynor,
unable, after the fashion of pompous men, to conceal any particle
of knowledge that was his own.</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" he snapped. "Stale news, like the rest of your fine
information. We have known it for a week."</p>
<p>Not a ripple crossed the Captain's face to betray the shock of
his surprise. But he frowned, and drew himself very stiffly
erect.</p>
<p>"Information, sir?" said he. "Mr Templeton, it occurs to me that
you have been using me unworthily." And for the first time in the
course of that interview he allowed the force of his personality to
envelop the Second Secretary, his blue eyes withering the man with
their sudden anger.</p>
<p>Thus a moment. Then he relapsed into the sycophant, the humble
suitor who pockets an offence and fawns upon the offender. His wry,
almost deprecatory smile reappeared.</p>
<p>"I should have been wary," he said. "I am but a blunt soldier;
stout enough at blows, sir, I assure you, but dull
enough&mdash;egad!&mdash;when it comes to a battle of wits with one of your
mettle. You should have spared me, sir. Fore gad, you should have
spared me!" he lamented.</p>
<p>Mr Templeton smiled at last, consented at last to put off some
measure of his frigid importance, melting as it were in this warm
flattery.</p>
<p>"Nay, now," said he, "'twas in your own interest that I
questioned you&mdash;in your own interest. Had you been furnished with
any piece of information that we could account of value, it must
have been deemed that his Majesty's Government had received a
favour at your hands. You would have placed the Government in your
debt, as it were, and it would have smoothed my path with my Lord
Carteret in obtaining the&mdash;ah&mdash;gratification of your ambitions. You
understand, I am assured&mdash;you understand."</p>
<p>"Sir," cried Captain Gaynor, "I have again betrayed my dullness.
But&mdash;" And his shrug was eloquent. It said as plainly as if the
words were spoken: "How can so ordinary a man as I attempt to
fathom the methods of one so extraordinary as you."</p>
<p>"Say no more, sir; say no more!" Mr Templeton thrust back his
chair, and rose&mdash;a tall figure that carried itself superbly, with
head thrown back and rather to one side. "We will do what we can
for you. You will leave me your&mdash;ah&mdash;credentials?"</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor had them ready&mdash;a bulky parcel which he now drew
from an inner pocket of his coat and laid upon the Secretary's
table. Of these credentials some few were genuine; but the greater
part were forgeries; in the aggregate they accounted for almost
every day of his time during the past ten years.</p>
<p>Adventurous as had been the life of which some of these
documents proclaimed the genuine record, these adventures were as
naught to that which lay before him ere he should come again to
claim that package.</p>
<p>Mr Templeton balanced the bundle of papers in his hands. "If
these speak as well for you as speaks my cousin, you may depend
upon employment being found for you&mdash;employment worthy of
your&mdash;ah&mdash;attainments. You will wait upon me again, I hope, sir, in
a little while. Should I need to communicate with you in the
meantime, where shall I find you lodged?"</p>
<p>"I go to Chertsey tomorrow," answered the Captain, "to Priory
Close."</p>
<p>"To Sir John Kynaston's?" quoth the minister.</p>
<p>The soldier bowed. "He was my father's friend many years ago,
sir, and he has offered me the hospitality of his roof for some
little time during my sojourn here."</p>
<p>"Why, that, sir," cried Mr Templeton, whose geniality seemed to
increase in a measure as the interview drew to its conclusion,
"that is a further recommendation in your favour&mdash;a further
recommendation. Sir John stands well with the Government. He has
the ear of Lord Carteret. Now a word from him&mdash;"</p>
<p>The Captain bowed, his hand on his heart.</p>
<p>"Like all great men, sir, that I have ever met&mdash;and I have
travelled more than most&mdash;you account mighty the little power of
any other and little the mighty power that is your own. Mr
Templeton, I am content to leave my petition in your hands. I could
desire no better advocate, even as I could not find a greater." He
bowed again before the smiling Secretary; for the Secretary was
smiling broadly now, the dissolution of his iciness complete. "I
have the honour, sir, to take my leave of you. I shall keep you
informed of my every movement. Sir," (yet another bow) "your very
obedient, grateful servant."</p>
<p>He was in the antechamber at last, coughing into his
handkerchief as he went. And behind him he left a beaming Mr
Templeton, who rubbed his hands and chuckled and told the Cupids on
the ceiling what an infernally astute fellow he was. For had he not
turned this soldier inside out? Had he not wrung him dry, as it
were; sucked him like an orange, ere the fellow had apprehended his
aims and become duly ferocious? But even that ferocity had been
overwhelmed by admiration of Mr Templeton's superb penetration.</p>
<p>The Second Secretary resumed his seat at the littered table, and
his smile faded. After all, he reflected, this adventurer had told
him nothing that was not known already Still, that was because he
possessed no further knowledge, else most assuredly it would have
been drawn out of him with the rest.</p>
<p>He took up the package of credentials. These must be looked
through. Something must be found for a man who recognised dignity,
authority and intellect so readily The Secretary became conscious
of a growing affection for Captain Gaynor, a desire to exert
himself to serve the fellow such as was very rare with him.</p>
<p>But matters of State impended. He smote a bell. The usher
appeared, and the mask of frigid gravity once more descended upon
the lofty features of Mr Second Secretary Templeton.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>Chapter 4. FATE'S AGENTS</h2>
<p>So excellent an impression did Captain Gaynor leave of himself
upon the Second Secretary that there reached him later that day an
invitation to dine with Mr Templeton on the morrow, which was
Wednesday.</p>
<p>He went, and used the occasion well, not only to advance himself
further in the favour of the statesman, but also to make a conquest
of Mr Templeton's lady, a plump, frivolous woman who none the less
governed the Second Secretary with a tyranny that was absolute.
Captain Gaynor departed with the conviction that Mr Templeton's
subjection to her rule was the school in which he learnt the art of
subjecting others.</p>
<p>There was little in that visit that calls for chronicling,
unless it be that having expressed himself like the most
thorough-paced Whig, and cursed the turbulence of the Jacobites who
would disturb a realm in which there was peace and prosperity, the
Captain ventured to congratulate Mr Templeton upon the vigilance of
the Government and to marvel at the thoroughness of that same
vigilance, as evidenced by the circumstance that not a particle of
the information he had, himself, been able to bring straight from
Rome&mdash;including the fact that the notorious agent, Captain Jenkyn,
was on his way to England&mdash;but was already known to the omniscient
Second Secretary.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor's aim was to draw from Mr Templeton some hint
which should enable him to place his finger upon the leakage that
obviously existed. But it failed, and he dared not insist; nor did
he consider it worth while, concluding that it was very possible
that Mr Templeton did not possess the information which he
craved.</p>
<p>He deemed it well, however, to set Pauncefort upon his guard,
and with this intent he called upon him on the following afternoon.
His lordship received Captain Gaynor's news with obvious
consternation.</p>
<p>"How do you know this?" he cried, and his voice shook with a
sudden panic that surprised the Captain.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor enlightened him. Then: "You see," he said in
conclusion, "there is reason to fear a traitor from within. For how
else could this knowledge have reached the Government?</p>
<p>"Are you sure that it had?" questioned the scowling Pauncefort.
"May it not have been yourself who supplied the information, and
Templeton's assertion that it was already known a mere pretence to
give himself importance&mdash;to efface his obligation to you?"</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor smiled his amused tolerance of such a suggestion.
"I did not begin to be a plotter yesterday, my lord," said he.</p>
<p>But his lordship adhered to his point. "Yet it was a folly on
your part to have said what you did to him&mdash;rank folly."</p>
<p>"I think not, my lord," was the suave answer. "I aimed at
testing the extent of the Government's information, and I hold that
I succeeded but too well."</p>
<p>"Have it so, then," said Pauncefort. "For myself, I am content
to hold to the other opinion. I' faith, I should not sleep o'
nights did I not. Gad! For a moment you turned my stomach with your
talk of traitors."</p>
<p>"None the less," said the Captain soberly, "I warn you to be
circumspect. We meet, then, at 'The World's End,' at Chelsea, this
day se'nnight, when the work to do shall be planned. 'Twill be
safer thus than at your house or another's."</p>
<p>"Meanwhile," said his lordship, "you are for Priory Close?"</p>
<p>"I am on my way thither. I but stayed to give you this
information. I shall see you there, no doubt?"</p>
<p>My lord checked the answer he was obviously upon the point of
making. He flushed and hesitated a moment. Then, recovering from
his confusion, and attempting to gloze it over&mdash;</p>
<p>"I think not," he answered slowly. "My affairs here require
attention. There is much to do if I am to set this tangle to
rights."</p>
<p>"I rejoice," said the Captain, "to infer that it is amenable to
endeavour."</p>
<p>"Indeed, yes&mdash;thanks to the trick that Fortune played you here
two nights ago. To that I owe it that a way has been opened for
me."</p>
<p>"I am glad," said Gaynor pleasantly. "It would seem, then, that
your affairs were scarce as desperate as you feared. I am heartily
glad, sir."</p>
<p>His tone was so amiable and sincere that none might have guessed
that he, himself, had been the loser in the transaction. Thereupon,
he took his leave of Pauncefort. But as he was departing, his
lordship stayed him. The nobleman's face was troubled.</p>
<p>"At Priory Close you will meet Miss Hollinstone," said he.
"Commend me to her and to Sir John. And&mdash;touching the lady, and the
game we played here, you will remember that&mdash;that&mdash;" He fumbled
vainly for the expression that might inoffensively convey his
meaning.</p>
<p>The soldier stiffened. "That I lost, you would say, my lord, and
that you, therefore, continue in the claim which every man has upon
his betrothed."</p>
<p>"You put it&mdash;bluntly," his lordship deprecated.</p>
<p>"It is a blunt matter. But you may quiet your alarms." The
Captain all but sneered. "They do little honour to the lady and
still less to myself."</p>
<p>Their farewells, thereafter, were repeated with some restraint,
and Captain Gaynor took his departure.</p>
<p>He had engaged himself a valet, a shrewd-faced little fellow
named Fisher, recommended to him by the landlord of the "George" as
a person of so much fidelity and honesty that the Captain had
despatched him ahead by the stage to Chertsey with his baggage. The
Captain himself rode forth alone and came, an hour or so after
taking leave of Pauncefort, to the dreary spaces of Hownslow
Heath.</p>
<p>In the distance ahead of him, a solitary horseman moved slowly
along the sky-line. Captain Gaynor would have observed him perhaps
more closely could he have known that this horseman was one of
Fate's agents to himself. For had not that horseman been present
there in that lonely tract of country, the Captain's career would
have run a vastly different course from that which gives occasion
to this chronicle.</p>
<p>A signpost threw a lengthening shadow athwart the ribbon of road
that wound through the parched spaces of the heath. The sun was no
more than a glowing disc upon the horizon. A black silhouette
against it, the horseman passed and dipped out of sight.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor rode on, his thoughts anywhere but upon that
fateful figure. He gained the summit of the rise and dipped in his
turn, steadying his horse, for the road was rough and deeply
ploughed with ruts of clay that were baked into stony ridges. There
was no sign now of the other horseman, no sign of living thing in
all that lonely place. But suddenly from the screen of a clump of
cedars that spread funereally a hundred yards ahead, the rider
reappeared. His back was towards the Captain. He never so much as
turned his head, seeming entirely unconscious of the other's rapid
approach. Such indeed was his unconsciousness that Captain Gaynor,
as he drew nigh, was moved to scrutinise him. He was a heavy
fellow, mounted upon a clumsy piebald horse. From under a round hat
wisps of black hair floated raggedly in the breeze. He wore a long
black riding-coat and dirty buckskins; and that was all that the
Captain could perceive until presently he drew alongside and
observed in addition a wolfish, lantern-jawed face above a dirty
neck-cloth and a still dirtier green satin waistcoat with ragged
and tarnished gold lace.</p>
<p>He was as unprepossessing a ruffian as could be met with in the
length and breadth of England, and nowhere could that meeting have
been less welcome than on the lonely stretch of Hownslow Heath.</p>
<p>"'Tis a fine evening, your honour," said he in an accent that
proclaimed an Irish origin.</p>
<p>"A fine evening it is," replied the Captain, coldly courteous.
He rode steadily amain, and must have sped past the other but that
the fellow touched up his piebald and kept level.</p>
<p>"'Tis a mightily lonesome place, this Heath," said he, as if
explaining his action, "and if there's a thing in all the world I
hate 'tis lonesomeness."</p>
<p>"It is a distaste which I do not share," said the Captain
curtly.</p>
<p>"D'ye not?" cried the other. "Now if there's a living man knows
a hint when he hears it, 'tis myself, bedad. So I'll not be
troublin' you farther with a company that's unwelcome. But there's
a word or two I'd be speakin' to you first. Will ye draw rein
awhile? Hold, I say! Hold or I'll be blowin' your head inside
out!"</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor reined in sharply. The ruffian had levelled a
heavy pistol with a long, polished barrel&mdash;the only polished thing
about him&mdash;on which the last rays of the vanishing sun threw a
blood-red gleam.</p>
<p>"What d'ye want with me?" quoth the soldier sharply.</p>
<p>The ruffian grinned. "Why, now, there's a plain question, and
here's a plain answer for you&mdash;faith, 'tis a trifle I'm wanting:
just your purse and that jewel at your throat and your watch if so
be ye have one."</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor seemed to be measuring the other with his eyes as
one who considers resistance. The wolfish face continued to grin,
and there was a confident gleam in the hungry, bloodshot eyes. Here
was no bungler; but a practised, self-confident knight of the toby,
who would have no more qualms about holding up a soldier than a
dowager, and still less about shooting either if expediency advised
it.</p>
<p>Gaynor's wry smile appeared at last. "Faith," said he, "ye have
the advantage of me, I think."</p>
<p>"I'm thinkin' the same, and I'm glad ye're reasonable; for I'd
be mortal sorry to shed the blood of such a broth of a boy over a
paltry matter of a handful of guineas and a jewel or two. 'Live and
let live' is my motto, your honour."</p>
<p>The Captain produced his purse. It was of black silk and bulky,
and through the straining meshes of the knitting there appeared a
yellow gleam.</p>
<p>The tobyman brought his nag a pace nearer. With pistol levelled
and eyes that never left the Captain's face, he held out his left
hand to receive the purse. But it seemed that Gaynor relinquished
it too soon; just as the ruffian's fingers touched it, in fact; so
that it dropped and fell between them with a resounding chink.</p>
<p>The tobyman's eyes were instinctively lowered to follow its
fall&mdash;a deplorable error this in one so practised in his trade. An
instant later the pistol was dashed from his hand by a blow that
almost shattered his knuckles. Before he could attempt to defend
himself, before he could properly realise what was befalling him,
that blow was followed by a second, this time upon his head, so
shrewdly delivered that he reeled in his saddle.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor was standing in his stirrups, which gave him the
advantage of being above the thief. He grasped his heavily mounted
riding-crop like a cudgel, and like a cudgel he used it with a
dexterity and rapidity such as the other had never encountered in
all his adventurous career. Before he had recovered from that
dazing blow across the crown a shower of others had fallen upon his
body, and lifted a cloud of dust from his coat. Bewildered by the
suddenness and thoroughness of the onslaught, he was beyond all
thought of defence or retaliation.</p>
<p>As arrant a coward without his pistol as he was valiant with it,
he realised that he had grasped a scorpion. He stayed for no more.
He gathered up his reins and ploughed the piebald's flanks with his
spurs. The maddened horse half reared, then flung forward as from a
catapult and broke into a gallop. But Captain Gaynor was not yet
content. He started in pursuit, brandishing that formidable
crop.</p>
<p>The tobyman, flying with terror in his soul, was rendered
desperate. There remained him yet another pistol. He plucked it
forth with his half-shattered hand, swung round in the saddle and
blazed at his pursuer.</p>
<p>His aim was wild and his pistol-hand in no case to serve him
accurately. None the less the shot did all that was necessary to
arrest pursuit. The charge, at fairly close range, entered the
breast of Captain Gaynor's mare. The poor beast screamed and reared
and collapsed in a heap from which the soldier was no more than in
time to leap clear.</p>
<p>He stood in the road, cursing the highwayman and his own folly
in having given chase. Thus a moment. Then, his wounded horse
demanding his attention, he drew one of his pistols from its
holster and made an end of the beast's agony. That done, he walked
back to the spot where the encounter had taken place, and recovered
the purse which in his zeal to punish he had all but forgotten.
Then, slowly, he retraced his steps to his fallen horse, and
considered his position. He was still a good nine miles from his
destination, and dusk must overtake him before long.</p>
<p>He stood pondering there when his ears caught a distant clank
and rattle, accompanied by the pounding of hoofs. The sounds drew
rapidly nearer along the road by which he had come; soon a chaise
appeared upon the ridge behind him, and came down the incline
swaying and jolting alarmingly over that execrable road.</p>
<p>The Captain stood now awaiting it, the object of suspicious
glances from the coachman, and from the footman who hung by a strap
behind the approaching vehicle. As it came up with him, he raised
his hand, and the chaise was brought gradually to a standstill, for
the fallen horse announced plainly enough that here was a traveller
in distress.</p>
<p>From the window, thrusting aside the leather curtain, a
wondrously coiffed head protruded. A feminine voice, high pitched
and querulous, assailed the Captains ears.</p>
<p>"What now, Gilbert? Why do we stay?" Then the lady's glance fell
upon Captain Gaynor, and with a little scream of fear the wondrous
head vanished hurriedly into the carriage.</p>
<p>Smiling, the Captain advanced, hat in hand, to the door of the
chaise.</p>
<p>"Pray do not be alarmed," he said. "I am a suppliant not an
assailant."</p>
<p>"'Tis is a gentleman what's 'ad 'is 'oss killed," announced the
well-nourished Gilbert from the box.</p>
<p>Another head appeared, and the Captain found himself confronted
by a young face that was extremely good to look upon&mdash;a delicate
little face under an elaborate arrangement of golden curls; the
eyes that met his own so frankly were very blue and invested with a
look of innocence; the little chin was sharply pointed, and the
mouth was very small and delicately arched. It was such a face as
Greuze loved to paint, the pretty advertisement of a trivial little
soul.</p>
<p>The Captain bowed gravely. "Ma'am," said he, "I have met with a
mischance. My horse has been shot under me."</p>
<p>Alarmed concern flickered into the blue eyes. "Shot!" she cried,
in a slender treble. "La, sir!"</p>
<p>Over her shoulders reappeared the face of the elder lady. "Shot,
did ye say?" she cried. "Lard a' mercy! Who shot it, sir?"</p>
<p>"A rogue of a tobyman, ma'am."</p>
<p>"A tobyman!" The voice shrilled on the word. "Ye hear! What have
I ever said, and ye would never heed me. But 'tis the last time
that ever I'll cross the Heath. Lard, now! 'Tis a miracle we are
not murdered&mdash;a miracle!"</p>
<p>"I have some distance to go, ma'am," said the Captain, "and I
should be most profoundly obliged if you would permit me to sit
with your coachman as far as the next post-house, where I can
repair my loss."</p>
<p>The younger lady was first thrust aside, then entirely eclipsed
by the elder, whose presence came once more to fill the window. She
surveyed the suppliant with an air of grim suspicion.</p>
<p>"How far d'ye travel, sir?" she questioned him. "To Chertsey,
ma'am," he replied.</p>
<p>Upon that she seemed to eye him more attentively. A voice
murmured behind her in the coach. She turned a moment.</p>
<p>"It is possible, Damaris," he heard her say. "He has the air of
it."</p>
<p>Damaris! The name hummed through his brain.</p>
<p>"May I ask, sir," came his questioner again, "whom we shall have
the honour of assisting?"</p>
<p>"My name, ma'am, is Gaynor&mdash;Captain Harry Gaynor, your obedient
servant to command."</p>
<p>"Why, 'tis so, then!" she cried, and smiled&mdash;a comely,
well-featured woman. "La, now! 'Tis the oddest of encounters. You
are for Priory Close."</p>
<p>The Captain confessed, and added the assumption which had
flashed into his mind. "You will be Lady Kynaston. 'Tis an odd
chance, indeed."</p>
<p>"James, you lout," she called to the gaping footman, who had
swung himself down from his perch, "the door."</p>
<p>The lackey sprang to let down the steps. Her ladyship alighted,
leaning upon his shoulder. She proved now to be of a good height
and presence, and to carry herself well. And not only was she
comely in herself, as I have said, but most fully appreciative of
comeliness in the other sex. She dropped the Captain a half-curtsy,
and met him now with the most engaging of smiles.</p>
<p>"We count ourselves fortunate to be of service to you, sir,"
said she, and proceeded to present him to her companions. This
presentation she performed, as she did all things, in a superficial
manner. "These," she said, half turning from him and with a wave of
the hand towards the occupants of the chaise, "are Miss
Hollinstone, my niece, and my daughter, Evelyn. She is my only
child, sir, a matter which sorely vexes Sir John, for he would
dearly have loved a son. 'Tis a thousand pities that heaven should
not have gratified his wishes," she ran on, garrulous and
inconsequent. "But then, on the other hand, the rearing of sons in
these disordered days is so grave a responsibility that sometimes I
think perhaps heaven knows best."</p>
<p>The Captain had scarce heard a word of it. His eyes were upon
the two ladies who remained in the coach&mdash;the golden-headed child
with whom already he had spoken, whom he assumed to be Damaris
Hollinstone, and another, who was taller and dark, and of a very
different type of beauty. He surveyed them both, it is true, and
made his bow to them. But it was upon the supposed Miss Hollinstone
that his eyes rested with the more profound interest, and certain
odd stirrings, which were entirely consequent upon the strange game
he had played three nights ago with my Lord Pauncefort.</p>
<p>Perceiving at last that the girl was growing conscious of his
scrutiny, the Captain turned to Lady Kynaston with polite inquiries
touching Sir John. She replied at long length with a catalogue of
Sir John's real and fancied ailments, the conclusion to be drawn
from which seemed to be that her husband was in excellent health
and looking forward with pleasure to his visitor's arrival.</p>
<p>"It is growing late, mother," said the dark lady from her corner
of the chaise, "and Captain Gaynor, no doubt, will be in haste to
arrive."</p>
<p>"Where one may journey so pleasantly," said the Captain, as
courtesy dictated, "there can be no haste to arrive anywhere."</p>
<p>"La!" said the fair Damaris, and laughed. "Yet indeed, mother,
you are detaining him," she added. And Captain Gaynor, reflecting
that the child had indeed been as a daughter to Lady Kynaston,
found the mode of address a proper and pretty tribute.</p>
<p>Expressing herself in tritely caustic terms upon the pertness of
the age and the deplorable lack of deference to elders, her
ladyship none the less acted upon the hints of her daughter and her
niece, and permitted the Captain to assist her into the chaise once
more. Captain Gaynor followed her, and took his seat beside her.
The steps were raised, the door closed, and once more the carriage
lurched drunkenly along.</p>
<p>By her whom he had assumed to be Damaris the Captain was invited
to relate the details of his adventure. He responded to the
invitation, but in doing so it was to Lady Kynaston and her
daughter that he chiefly addressed himself.</p>
<p>In this he obeyed the somewhat peremptory dictates of his sense
of honour. After what had passed between himself and Pauncefort, he
felt that the greatest circumspection was incumbent upon him. In no
case could he have looked upon Miss Hollinstone as a conquest to be
attempted, knowing her betrothed to another. But since she had been
the subject of a game; since he must look upon her as upon a stake
for which he had played and which he had lost, it was as if a wall
had been set up between them, as if she had become in some still
more emphatic manner the property of another, which he should be no
better than a thief did he attempt to filch.</p>
<p>Reclining in the chaise when his tale was done, and considering
his position, what time the ladies chattered of highwaymen, the
perils of the Heath and his own singular address in turning the
tables upon one who had held him at such disadvantage, the
Captain's thoughts strayed again to the matter of that game. A
swift judge of character, he found much in that fair face and in
that too perfect rosebud mouth to be deplored. If at some time in
his life a man must think of mating, let him then mate with one who
will be prepared to give as well as to receive. So held the
Captain. And this Damaris, he judged to be of those who cannot give
because they possess nothing of their own. Being one who seeks upon
the surface some indication of what may lie below, the Captain was
not merely left indifferent by the girl's undoubted winsomeness,
but he found in it something that actually repelled him. That fair
exterior he at first accounted a false lure. But this impression he
soon corrected as too harsh; falseness implies at least some
activity of personality; and here was one whom he judged to be
entirely passive. He likened her, at length, to the camellia&mdash;and
was well pleased with the image&mdash;perfect and graceful in shape and
colouring, yet exhaling nothing and wilting to the touch.</p>
<p>These swift deductions and the consequent slight aversion which
the child inspired in him, led him naturally enough to wonder what
course he would have taken had be won that game which he had
played. Would he have claimed the stakes? He thought of his master,
waiting patiently in Rome, subsisting almost upon the charity of
strangers, and he concluded that had he won he must have sought to
pouch his winnings for the sake of that king to whom he owed all
sacrifices. But on the whole he was content that this particular
sacrifice had not been imposed upon him by the cards. Perhaps he
was also relieved because, that game being lost by him, he found
the task of abiding by its issue an easy one to discharge.</p>
<p>There was, then, no reluctance on his part. But he opined that,
further, there must not even be the semblance of it; and to that
end he adopted now the course that must be his during his sojourn
at Priory Close. He addressed himself almost entirely to Lady
Kynaston and her daughter. As he looked at the latter, he could not
refrain from contrasting her with Miss Hollinstone entirely to Miss
Hollinstone's disadvantage. He considered this pale, thoughtful
face, with its liquid brown eyes that were gentle to the point of
wistfulness, he observed the sensitiveness of the lips, the
nobility of the brow, and he caught himself thinking that had this
been Damaris&mdash;</p>
<p>In the fading daylight they rumbled over a great bridge, which
spanned the river below the thundering waters of a weir, and soon
thereafter the wheel-ploughed roads gave place to cobbles; houses
loomed on either hand; they were entering the town of Chertsey.</p>
<p>The Captain had desired to be set down at the "Giant's
Head"&mdash;the hostelry where his servant awaited him with the baggage,
that he might give the fellow his commands. So the chaise came to a
standstill before the inn, and stood there some five minutes, what
time the Captain went within.</p>
<p>Now it happens that those were five as momentous minutes as any
that he had spent that day. They completed for Fate the work which
her agent, the highwayman, had begun on Hownslow Heath.</p>
<p>In her corner of the chaise the golden-headed child sat brooding
with an ill-humoured droop in the lines of her pretty mouth. If
there was in life an influence to which every nerve and thread of
her was sensitive, that influence was the interest she excited in
the male. The attraction of the other sex seemed to be the very
mainspring of her being, and where she failed entirely of this, her
natural object, the failure fretted her, leaving her vanity raw and
aching, her little spirit bitter. She was accustomed to see her
cousin reap the greater harvest of such interest, but she was not
inured to it, although she accounted that for this an explanation
existed which nowise reflected upon herself. But never yet in all
her experience had she failed more signally than on the present
occasion; never had she seen a man more entirely absorbed by her
demure cousin than this Captain Gaynor, never one who had treated
herself with such utter, such almost calculated disregard.</p>
<p>With burning cheeks and quivering lips, like a whipped child,
she huddled herself miserably in her corner. Twice she had
addressed the Captain, and he had scarce answered her, so intent
was he upon her cousin. It was, she vowed, not to be borne. He was
an insufferable boor. When he alighted at the inn at Chertsey she
exploded&mdash;not noisily, but with a quiet, stinging scorn that she
knew how to employ upon occasion.</p>
<p>"Heigho!" she sighed. "I do thank heaven, Damaris, that when I
am wooed 'twill be for myself and not my money-bags."</p>
<p>And by this speech you learn of the misapprehension under which
Captain Gaynor had laboured as to the respective identities of the
two girls&mdash;a misapprehension buttressed by the circumstance that
both girls addressed Lady Kynaston alike as "mother."</p>
<p>The pale face of Damaris showed ghostly almost in the deepening
gloom. A shadow crossed it.</p>
<p>"How unkind in you, Evelyn," was her gentle rebuke. "And it is
an unkindness of which you never weary. Is it not enough that I
know I am wooed and won for what I have?" she inquired, and there
was an oddly bitter note in the question, arguing a conviction
acquired in suffering. "Do you consider that to be so enviable an
estate that you must for ever be reminding me of it?"</p>
<p>"My dear!" purred lady Kynaston to soothe her, "Evelyn is
heedless, no more."</p>
<p>"It were kinder to be less," said Damaris. But Evelyn's little
laugh was sharp and unpleasant.</p>
<p>"La!" said she. "You will for ever be misapprehending me. 'Twas
not to Lord Pauncefort that I referred, but to this Captain Gaynor,
who is an ensample of all the others."</p>
<p>"What have I done?" cried Damaris.</p>
<p>"'Tis not what you have done, my dear; 'tis what your fortune
does for you. That is why I am thankful to be as I am."</p>
<p>"I have always said," put in the inconsequent Lady Kynaston,
"that we all have a deal more to be thankful for than we are
aware." The good, dull woman scented no quarrel here. 'Twas not by
hints that facts were to be brought to the notice of her
ladyship.</p>
<p>"Evelyn, I do not understand you," said Damaris. Miss Kynaston
moved petulantly. She sat forward, so that a shaft of light coming
from one of the windows of the inn threw the golden head and
winsome face into sharp relief against the gloom of that interior,
and revealed the bitter lines in which the perfect&mdash;the all too
perfect&mdash;mouth was set.</p>
<p>"The man had no eyes save for you," she sneered. You see, she
was not subtle.</p>
<p>"Should that be my fault even were it true?" quoth Damaris, and
she put out a hand to take her cousin's, in her sweet desire to
conciliate. But Evelyn was quick to avoid the contact.</p>
<p>"Nay," she answered, "not your fault. 'Tis what I am saying.
'Tis the fault of other things; the penalty of being so great an
heiress."</p>
<p>"I have always said that there is no station in life but has its
penalties, my dears," murmured Lady Kynaston, still all unconscious
of the duel that was being fought there under her very nose.</p>
<p>And now Damaris answered as she would not have answered&mdash;for her
nature was all compounded of gentleness&mdash;but that she was stung to
it by this persistent gibe, and yet more by Evelyn's avoidance of
her hand. More, that gibe had wounded her as only truth can wound;
for she had more than cause to perceive the truth of it, and her
gentle soul was all raw from a cruel humiliation lately suffered,
as presently you shall learn.</p>
<p>"Why, as for Captain Gaynor," said she, "I do not believe that
he knew which was Damaris Hollinstone, which Evelyn Kynaston."</p>
<p>A laugh was her cousin's only answer&mdash;very eloquent of
incredulity of so preposterous a statement.</p>
<p>"I can tell you, at least," said Damaris, "that twice he
addressed me as Miss Kynaston."</p>
<p>"Did he so?" cried her ladyship. "'Twas an odd mistake!"</p>
<p>"Odd, indeed!" sneered Evelyn. If she had been hurt before, she
was in torment now, until vanity came to reassure her, and
confidently to assert that this was a deliberate untruth. She
estimated herself highly, and she accounted preposterous and
fatuous any assumption that in equality of circumstances she could
fail to carry an easy victory over her cousin. This and her
resentment drove her now to her outrageous proposal.</p>
<p>"If that be so, if he is, indeed, not clear which of us is
Damaris Hollinstone, the lady of fortune, shall we"&mdash;she paused,
and her voice assumed a note of slyness&mdash;"shall we convey to him
the impression that I am she?&mdash;that you are just penniless Evelyn
Kynaston?"</p>
<p>"My child, what are you saying?" broke in her mother. "You are
very far from penniless; you are&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I speak comparatively, mother dear&mdash;as compared with Damaris
here. Come, Damaris, what do you say?"</p>
<p>"Say?" echoed Damaris, amazement ringing in her voice. "I say
that you are out of your senses, Evelyn."</p>
<p>Evelyn hummed a moment through closed lips; then her scornful
little laugh trilled forth again. "Heigho! I fear me you are a
boaster, Damaris."</p>
<p>"Evelyn!" interjected her shocked mother.</p>
<p>"A boaster&mdash;I?" quoth Damaris warmly.</p>
<p>"What else&mdash;since you dare not put your assertion to the
test?"</p>
<p>"Dare not?" Damaris was moved to something almost approaching
anger. Gentle she was; but she was also conscious of what was due
to herself; and here it seemed was one who craved a lesson on that
subject.</p>
<p>"Dare not," Evelyn insisted, snapping.</p>
<p>"But, my dears, it would be so vastly confusing!" protested Lady
Kynaston.</p>
<p>Damaris took her resolve. "'Twill be only for a day or so," she
said. "And you must induce Sir John to countenance this pretence.
'Tis for your daughter's good, I assure you," she added, something
grimly.</p>
<p>"You&mdash;you consent, then?" cried Evelyn, a little breathlessly,
gripped now that the matter was to be tested, by a sudden fear of
failure.</p>
<p>"You leave me no alternative. Be Damaris Hollinstone, then, and
should you fail in the unworthy task you have in mind, never let me
hear again this taunt with which you have so often wounded me." She
sank back into her corner.</p>
<p>Evelyn's answer was a laugh. Her momentary fear had passed. If
in addition to the beauty heaven had bestowed upon her, she had the
embellishment of a fortune, there was little cause to fear that she
would fail.</p>
<p>But at this point her mother intervened, grasping at last the
drift of what was afoot and whither it might lead.</p>
<p>"But, my dears," she cried, "I do not desire Captain Gaynor's
wooing of my daughter. I will not have it, Evelyn; leastways not
until I know more of this gentleman. I am not sure that he is a
desirable husband. He is a very gallant, handsome gentleman, to be
sure, and that is something almost unusual in these days; but I
understand that he is a soldier of fortune."</p>
<p>"A soldier of fortune!" breathed Evelyn. "He is a soldier of
fortune, and yet you would have me believe that he&mdash;But here he
comes! Chut! Henceforth I am Damaris Hollinstone, mother&mdash;please
remember."</p>
<p>The footman opened the door of the chaise for the Captain, who
ascended briskly, breathing apologies for the delay.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>Chapter 5. THE WARNING</h2>
<p>It would really seem as if Fate were determined to leave the
Captain no way of escape from the situation into which she had
thrust him. Her agents had been first the highwayman and then Miss
Kynaston. What the acquisitiveness of the one had begun, the vanity
of the other had continued. Even so, however, circumstances had not
yet gone so far astray from the proper road but that a word from
Sir John Kynaston must presently have set all to rights once more.
But here again Fate was at hand to round off her ironic work. When
the chaise bearing the Captain and the ladies arrived at Priory
Close, they found Sir John, spurred and booted, on the very point
of departure, summoned an hour since by a courier to the bedside of
his brother who lay ill at Bath. The baronet had but waited to
welcome Captain Gaynor ere he set out.</p>
<p>It was twenty years since the Captain last had visited Priory
Close. He had retained, however, a very vivid recollection of the
house to which, as a little lad of nine, he had been taken by his
father. Between his father and Sir John the very deepest friendship
had existed, and Harry Gaynor himself was conscious of an
inheritance in this respect, for Sir John had ever treated him with
almost parental affection. Nevertheless, on no single one of the
occasions of his visits to England during the last seven years (his
father had followed James II to France and Harry had gone with him,
his mother being dead) had Captain Gaynor set foot at Priory Close
or made the acquaintance of the baronet's lady and daughter. This
had been by his own desire, and lest in the event of his
apprehension and the discovery of his business Sir John should come
to be implicated with him. And when Sir John had formerly pressed
him to make of Priory Close his headquarters during his sojourn in
England, pointing out that he would receive additional shelter from
the circumstance that the baronet himself stood high above all
suspicion, was a Justice of the Peace and universally accounted the
most solid of Whigs, Captain Gaynor had ever made answer that these
were but additional reasons why a person so very valuable to his
master should not jeopardise the position which he held.</p>
<p>On the present occasion, however, the Captain had considered
that in view of the more than ordinarily elaborate precautions he
had taken and the excellent pretext upon which he was in England&mdash;a
pretext which, if the worst befell, might clearly be urged to have
imposed upon Sir John as much as upon any other&mdash;he was justified
in accepting the hospitality which the baronet was so
affectionately eager to extend to him.</p>
<p>Sir John received him now with a welcome of quite extraordinary
warmth.</p>
<p>Vigour of constitution, tranquillity of conscience, clean living
and abundance of exercise had marvellously preserved Sir John
against the undermining work of time. In this, his sixtieth year,
he had the air of a man of little more than forty. True, he
inclined to portliness, but not unduly so; and being tall of body
and erect of carriage this portliness seemed in him but an
attribute of vigour. His blue eyes were clear, keen and unusually
mirthful; it was, indeed, his eyes that were chiefly responsible
for his youthful air. His skin was healthily tanned, and under the
grizzled periwig which he invariably wore, his countenance was
noble and genially handsome.</p>
<p>Esteeming Captain Gaynor highly as he did, for qualities of
whose existence in him none was better aware than Sir John
Kynaston, and having no son of his own to succeed him, he had for
some time nourished the secret hope that his daughter and the
Captain might come to make a match between them. To the fact that
upon his own merit there was no man whom Sir John would more
cordially have welcomed for his son-in-law was to be added that
old-time friendship between the baronet and the elder Gaynor, and
the thought that such a union would for that friendship's sake have
delighted Harry Gaynor's father had he lived.</p>
<p>Sir John would have built confidently upon this hope, but for
one thing&mdash;his daughter herself. The one cloud in the singularly
cloudless sky of his life was Evelyn. He cherished no delusions
concerning her. He knew the dangerous extent of her inherent
vanity, frivolity and irresponsibility Yet he loved her perhaps the
more because of these very failings, with an affection that was
blent with pity for infirmities.</p>
<p>Just so had he always loved her mother, with a love that was
largely compounded of compassion for shortcomings that matrimony
had revealed to him in the woman of his hasty, youthful choice.
There was something almost noble in the care with which he had ever
concealed from his wife the disillusion she had occasioned him. He
had thrust from his sight her shortcomings. He magnified to himself
her virtues of docility and simple good-nature, and sturdily he
took consolation in them. To his councils, however, she was not
admitted. She knew no more of the inward workings of his mind than
she knew of any other man's; she had, for instance, the same notion
of his politics as had Mr Templeton and the other gentlemen into
whose eyes he flung dust with the hand of calculation.</p>
<p>Where another might have inveighed against his wife and attached
to her the blame for the shortcomings which her daughter had
inherited, Sir John, with a rare fortitude and breadth of outlook,
inveighed against himself alone, and neither upon wife nor daughter
did he visit a fault that proceeded from his own error. Sir John,
you will have gathered, was something of a philosopher.</p>
<p>There remained Evelyn's future to concern him. Being as she was,
he foresaw an ocean of trouble in her married life unless he could
contrive for her a husband at once tender and dominant, a tried man
whose patience and strength would mould her perhaps as he, himself,
had failed to do so, and at the same time cherish and shelter her
and steer her clear of those shoals of life upon which, without
strong guidance, she seemed foredoomed to suffer shipwreck.</p>
<p>In Harry Gaynor he believed that he had found the very man for
his purpose, and if at times he deemed it impossible that Harry
Gaynor, being as he was, should bestow so much as a thought upon
Evelyn, yet at others&mdash;being a philosopher, as I have said&mdash;he
would reflect that in Nature's inscrutably admirable way it was
often ordained that precisely such men should be attracted by just
such women. Upon this slender foundation, then, he would build his
hope what time he waited.</p>
<p>When so much is understood some notion is formed of the
affectionate quality of the welcome which Sir John extended to his
guest and of the concern for his guest's welfare which inspired
him. Being, as he was, in some haste to depart, and as some days
might elapse ere he returned, he was yet anxious to know how fared
with Captain Gaynor the dangerous matters which had occasioned his
visit to England.</p>
<p>So with little more than a word of explanation and apology, he
at once carried off his guest to the seclusion of the library.
There, having again expressed his regrets at this urgent need for
departure in the very hour of his guest's arrival, and having
satisfied himself, as indeed any might do at a glance, of Harry's
physical well-being, he questioned him solicitously on the score of
his mission. For however urgent the unfortunate circumstance that
called Sir John away, he esteemed scarcely less urgent the thing he
had to say to Captain Gaynor.</p>
<p>In the golden candle-light from a silver cluster that stood upon
the library table, the Captain's bronzed face showed overcast. He
confessed that so far he had no reason to be satisfied with the
progress of his master's Cause in England.</p>
<p>Sir John nodded slowly, his own face thoughtful. "There," he
said, "you do not surprise me. There are moments when&mdash;" He paused,
and looked at the young man with eyes of the very kindliest
concern. "Has no doubt ever crossed your mind, Harry?" he inquired
gently. "Have you never asked yourself whether you may not have
wedded your young life, your energies and enthusiasms to a
dream&mdash;to the fruitless service of a company of dreamers?"</p>
<p>"Sir John!" exclaimed the other sharply, the faintest flush
stirring under the tan of his cheeks. Then, almost sadly, he asked:
"Are you, too, failing him?"</p>
<p>Sir John smiled; his blue eyes were steadfast. "I was speaking
of you, Harry; not of myself. You are young, full of enthusiasm,
ability and energy. Life lies before you. The world's your very
oyster. I am an old hulk who matter nothing&mdash;or very little. Being
this, I am content to abide where I am, and to continue to hold by
what I have held. But were I you&mdash;had I my youth and all my life
before me&mdash;I am not sure that my loyalty would stand the strain of
its fruitless sacrifice."</p>
<p>"Fruitless?" cried the young man hotly. "Have you lost faith in
us? Do you think that we shall not prevail?"</p>
<p>Sir John sighed. Slowly and thoughtfully he shook his head. "I
hope it, I pray for it, as every decent man must hope and pray for
right and justice. But what you have just perceived has been under
my eyes for some time. It fills me with despondency. It might well
cause me to turn aside if I were younger and mattered more."</p>
<p>"It is that you see this and nothing else," the Captain argued.
"If I saw no more than this I might share your fears. As it is, I
confess, that gathering at Pauncefort's house three nights ago was
a saddening spectacle. There we assembled most of those upon whom
his Majesty depends&mdash;a round dozen of the men he believes to be his
most stalwart and energetic supporters. I was his accredited agent,
coming amongst them for the first time, adventuring my neck to
bring them news and receive theirs. Yet they had naught for me. The
night was spent in gaming, and I saw such sums staked and won and
lost, that when I considered the plight of our gracious king, his
urgent need of funds, I could have broken that table into slivers
under their eyes as some small protest against their foul
supineness."</p>
<p>"Ah?" said Sir John. He was profoundly interested. "And the play
ran high?"</p>
<p>"Myself I won and lost again upwards of ten thousand guineas,"
said the Captain coldly.</p>
<p>The baronet gasped. He raised his hands&mdash;in one of which he held
his hat and riding-crop&mdash;to let them fall again to his sides. He
laughed softly, sadly contemptuous. "Ay!" he said. "Ay! And yet,
Harry, when such is the attitude of those whose very interest it
should be to support and encompass the return of our exiled king,
what hope can remain that the Cause will ultimately prevail?"</p>
<p>"None if we could not look farther than this. But we can." His
eyes glowed, and his voice rang with a sudden confidence. "Scotland
will rise again."</p>
<p>"Scotland!" said the baronet. "Build not overmuch on Scotland.
It rose before. You were in the rising yourself. It is not so very
long since. You were there; you saw, and yet&mdash;" He smiled. "Oh, to
be young and have youth's eternal faith in the fulfilment of its
desires!"</p>
<p>"Things shall be better planned another time," was the Captain's
confident assurance. "And, after all, perhaps we despond too soon
concerning the conditions of things here. London is not England
when all is said."</p>
<p>"It is the heart, at least; and from the movements of the heart
you may gauge the liveliness of the body."</p>
<p>But Captain Gaynor disregarded this. "I must to Rochester and
talk with Atterbury one of these days. I have messages for him from
his Majesty And on this night week I am to confer with a party of
our friends again in London. Pauncefort is sending word to
them."</p>
<p>Sir John's brows came thoughtfully together. He turned aside,
and with hands clasped behind him he paced the room to the window
and back until again he was standing before his guest. Then he
placed hat and whip upon the table and set his hands upon the young
man's shoulders.</p>
<p>"I speak to you as a child of my own," he said. "Consider well
ere you go further. You owe it to yourself. Did I see any
reasonable hope I were indeed the very last to dissuade you. But
here I see you wasting yourself upon a dream."</p>
<p>"Have not you done the same, Sir John?"</p>
<p>"It is out of that very experience that I warn you. I have been
fortunate and come scatheless through so far. But were it all to do
again&mdash;who knows? I am old, I say," the baronet repeated,
smiling&mdash;"too old to change, and of too little consequence."</p>
<p>"And of what consequence am I?" cried Gaynor. "I am a soldier of
fortune without kith or kin in all the world."</p>
<p>"If you had these?" quoth the baronet quickly, a sudden gleam in
those clear, youthful eyes of his&mdash;"if you had these?"</p>
<p>"It were different, perhaps. But I have them not, nor want
them&mdash;which is as well, for I have no right to them while this duty
stands before me. You speak to me as a father, Sir John&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I do, my dear boy."</p>
<p>"And yet you know that my father would not have spoken so." It
was said in a sad tone of remonstrance, of argument, that contained
no offence.</p>
<p>The answer startled Harry Gaynor.</p>
<p>"I am not sure." Sir John's voice was calm and steady. "I try to
speak to you as I believe your father would speak were he alive
today. You see, I knew him very well, Harry; better far than ever
you knew him. But there! We will talk no more tonight. I have far
to ride." He took up hat and whip once more. "Use this house as
your own home till I return, and&mdash;and go warily, lad." He patted
the Captain's shoulder affectionately. "Go warily."</p>
<p>"I shall go warily, never fear," was the easy answer; "the more
so since the Government is already acquainted with my presence in
England."</p>
<p>Sir John threw up his head in alarm, the habitual joviality
fading from his countenance.</p>
<p>"Oh, not in my own name," the Captain reassured him. "They dream
of no connection between 'Captain Jenkyn' and Captain Gaynor, and
Mr Templeton is seeking to find for Captain Gaynor a post in the
Colonies. But he knows that Captain Jenkyn is in England, and his
spies are searching for that Jacobite agent very diligently."</p>
<p>"You are sure&mdash;you are quite sure that Mr Templeton does not
connect you with&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Nay," laughed the Captain. "I should be laid by the heels
already were that the case." And, further to reassure his host, he
related the friendly entertainment he had received from the Second
Secretary. "It is not fear that concerns me," he ended. "'What
concerns me is to discover this traitor who is so singularly well
informed."</p>
<p>"Well, well!" sighed the baronet, and upon that he seemed to
dismiss the subject. He held out his hand in farewell.</p>
<p>"I devoutly hope," said the Captain, "that you will find your
brother's condition improved when you arrive at Bath."</p>
<p>"I trust so, indeed, Harry. I shall return as soon as may
be."</p>
<p>He had reached the door when he paused again. He turned once
more, and his face was very grave, his clear eyes oddly troubled.
He came slowly back.</p>
<p>"A last word, Harry my boy," he said, in a low voice. "Be wary
how far you trust my Lord Pauncefort. I do not."</p>
<p>The Captain's surprise stared from his eyes.</p>
<p>"How?" he cried. "What is't you imply?"</p>
<p>"Ah, don't ask me," returned the other, shaking his head. "I
have no clear cause, perhaps, for saying so much. Yet I say it
urgently&mdash;beware of Pauncefort. Good night."</p>
<p>But the Captain would not let him go on that. He caught the
baronet's sleeve. "Sir John!" he cried. "You cannot leave it
there."</p>
<p>Gaynor's every instinct was to brush the warning aside. But he
was never a man to obey his instincts. He required reasons ere he
judged, and for reasons he now pressed Sir John. He put it that his
life might be hanging in the balance, which rendered him
irresistible.</p>
<p>Sir John sighed and frowned. He flicked his boots abstractedly
with his whip, and looked the very picture of reluctance.</p>
<p>"God knows," he said at last, "it is against my nature to heap
up molehills into mountains that will entomb a man's honour, and it
is what you are asking of me, Harry."</p>
<p>"Nay. What I ask you is to produce your reasons that I may
combat them. If there are but molehills I shall recognise them and
kick them over, never fear. I cannot credit what you imply; but
neither can I credit that you would imply it without good
grounds&mdash;or grounds that you consider good. I beg you to let me
have a sight of these that I may judge them for myself."</p>
<p>"Why, then," said Sir John, though still with obvious
reluctance, "to be quite frank, first and foremost&mdash;indeed, first
and last&mdash;Pauncefort is a desperate gamester, a gamester rendered
desperate by disastrous speculation. There are excellent reasons
why I should have informed myself of his affairs, and I know that
he totters upon the very brink of ruin, that he is in the clutches
of a moneylender named Israel Suarez, who never yet spared any man,
and who certainly will not spare his lordship. Now add to this that
I dislike him by instinct and by reason&mdash;and you should understand
why I mistrust him."</p>
<p>"Not quite," said Captain Gaynor slowly.</p>
<p>"You are determined not to spare me, Harry," said the baronet
with a sad smile. "My knowledge of human nature has taught me that
a broken gamester is never a man to be trusted. When in addition
the man is one in whose character I have found the gravest
shortcomings, you will understand that I would have you be as wary
of my Lord Pauncefort as I am myself."</p>
<p>"As you are yourself?" cried the Captain in amazement. "But,
then, how come you to have consented that he shall marry your
niece?"</p>
<p>"I have not consented that he shall marry her," answered Sir
John. "Had I done so they would have been married months ago."</p>
<p>"But their betrothal? Surely it has your sanction?"</p>
<p>"Their betrothal, yes. I have not the power to withstand it. But
as far as goes the power conferred upon me by my brother-in-law,
the late Geoffrey Hollinstone, I have exerted it and I shall
continue to exert it to oppose this union. Let me explain,
Harry.</p>
<p>"Damaris Hollinstone, as all the world knows, is heiress to as
stout a fortune as any in England. But by the terms of her father's
will she does not enter into the enjoyment and control of it until
she shall have reached the age of one and twenty, or until"&mdash;he
added, with slow emphasis&mdash;"she shall marry, provided that she does
so with my consent and approval of her choice. Should she marry
against my wishes before she attains that age, she receives under
her father's will rather less than a tenth of his estate&mdash;a modest
fortune still, but negligible when compared with the colossal
total. The rest of it is to be divided amongst a parcel of
cousins.</p>
<p>"It is now six months since Pauncefort first wooed her. She was
a child of little more than nineteen, with no worldly knowledge,
dazzled by so imposing a personality, and so she fell an easy
conquest. But when the question of her marriage arose I deemed it
my duty to oppose it, knowing his lordship's ways of life, as all
the world knows them. I told them, however, that the matter was not
one that need drive them to despair. If my Lord Pauncefort and the
lady were of the same mind in a year and a half's time from then&mdash;a
year from now&mdash;I should have no power to oppose their union.</p>
<p>"Damaris was content to wait. Pauncefort, however, attempted to
hector me in private, and thus betrayed something of his real
aims&mdash;aims concerning which I had never entertained a delusion. In
the end, however, he was forced to take me strictly at my word. He
asked me did I, meanwhile, consent to their betrothal. I answered
that I had not the power to oppose it.</p>
<p>"I was content, you see, to leave it to time to reveal his
lordship's true character to Damaris, and," he added slowly, "I
think that at last she has discovered it.</p>
<p>"Something happened a week ago," the baronet continued, smiling
rather grimly, "to open her eyes, and also to open mine. It is this
more than aught else that has led me to utter my warning to
you.</p>
<p>"His lordship sought me here. He was a little wild and not quite
master of himself, and being informed as I was of the state of his
affairs, I did not marvel at his condition or his visit or the
object of it. He desired me to consent that the marriage should
take place at once. Oh he was very vehement, and even very
plausible in all that he urged. I answered him that I did not
account it my duty to Damaris and to her late father, in whose
place I stand, to modify the determination taken six months ago.
Thereupon he demanded haughtily and angrily to know upon what
grounds I opposed a marriage that all the world accounted eminently
suitable. I begged him not to press me, but I was not sorry that he
insisted. Knowing what I knew of his affairs, I knew also that I
could hold him in a cleft stick did I so choose.</p>
<p>"'Be it so, then,' I answered him. 'I will tell you, but in the
presence of Damaris.'</p>
<p>"I summoned her; and when she came I told her upon what manner
of errand his lordship had visited me. In answer she assured me
that it had her entire concurrence, and she all but taxed me with
abusing the power which her father's will conferred upon me.</p>
<p>"'Wait, Damaris,' I said. 'My Lord Pauncefort has desired me to
state my reasons for opposing this wedding, and I have desired your
presence that you may hear my answer.'</p>
<p>"He was standing by that window, yonder, and as if to mark her
indifference to any arguments of mine, she crossed to his side,
whilst he put his arm about her as if to guard her from me. Oh, it
was vastly touching, I assure you; but there was something more to
follow.</p>
<p>"'Of the reasons that move me,' said I, 'I need to state but
two&mdash;the two most tangible and irrefutable ones. The first is the
unsuitability of my Lord Pauncefort on the score of his age. He is,
by almost fifteen years, your elder, Damaris. The other is that I
am persuaded that the main object of your suit, my lord, is not my
niece herself, but my niece's fortune.'</p>
<p>"They cried out upon me together at that denunciation.</p>
<p>"'It is a foul untruth,' thundered my lord in a great
passion.</p>
<p>"'I shall rejoice to be convinced of that,' said I. 'I am to
understand, then, that my niece's fortune weighs for nothing in
your calculations?'</p>
<p>"'No single jot&mdash;I swear it,' he answers me, mighty hot.</p>
<p>"'That your love for Damaris is entirely disinterested? That you
would make her your viscountess were she penniless?' I pursued.</p>
<p>"'Yes,' he answered me fiercely, ''pon honour.'</p>
<p>"'You swear it glibly enough,' said I. 'But will you prove
it?'</p>
<p>"'Prove it?' quoth he, and I saw a change creep over his face.
He was quick enough to discern the trap into which I had lured
him.</p>
<p>"'It is within your power to do so,' I assured him. 'You know
the terms of her father's will. I have no power to withstand the
marriage if you are both set on't. All that I have power to do is
to withhold and disperse the inheritance. But since that counts for
nothing with you, since it is Damaris you want and nothing more,
since your love for her knows naught of interest, why, take and
marry her in spite of me, and God give you joy of each other.'"</p>
<p>Sir John paused a moment, and shook his head in melancholy
retrospection.</p>
<p>"Poor Damaris!" he sighed. "You should have seen her at that
moment, Harry&mdash;her eyes aglow with confidence in herself and her
lover, with gladness at the prospect upon which I had opened that
crafty window. What cared she for her fortune, poor child? Gladly
would she forfeit it to prove her love. I was turned almost sick
with pity at the sight of that joyous transfiguration, what time
she waited for that swift, ardent answer upon which so confidently
she counted from her lover.</p>
<p>"Alas! It never came. He stood stricken there, a little pale,
staring at me in anger and dismay, until at last she raised her
eyes in inquiry to his face, wondering why the answer was delayed.
Before what she saw written on that countenance she blenched, and
with a little cry of pain she drew away from his arm, which had
grown as limp as all the rest of him.</p>
<p>"He turned to her. 'Damaris!' he cried. 'Hear me! Wait! You do
not understand.'</p>
<p>"'I think that I understand at last,' she answered, and her
voice was like a knife. I could have wept for the poor child.</p>
<p>"And Pauncefort still sought to reason with her, to explain that
which was clear already beyond all words. 'Don't you see, Damaris,'
was his plea, 'that if we do this, we give Sir John the
victory&mdash;that it is the very thing he desires since 'twill be to
his benefit.'</p>
<p>"It was true enough, though I had not given the matter a
thought. And yet he could not have employed an argument that must
more surely have completed his damnation.</p>
<p>"'To his benefit?' she questioned, snatching at a straw of hope.
'How to his benefit?'</p>
<p>"'Why, of the inheritance that is to be dispersed under such
circumstances, ten thousand pounds will go into his own
coffers.'</p>
<p>"'It shall go instead,' said I, 'to Chelsea Hospital.'</p>
<p>"But not even so much defence was needed to such an imputation.
She looked at him, and never have I seen a deadlier smile on living
face.</p>
<p>"'You are marvellous well acquainted with the terms of this
will,' said she, and struck him breathless by the unexpectedness of
that overwhelming blow. 'You must have given it some hours of
study.' With that and a little laugh, she turned again, and left us
here together."</p>
<p>Once more Sir John paused. He looked at his companion with a wan
smile. Captain Gaynor met the look with eyes that were gleaming
oddly; his lips were very tightly pressed. He had listened intently
to every word, and he was reflecting that the questionable game he
had played at Pauncefort's had been still more questionable than he
had deemed it since; for Pauncefort, it seemed, had staked
something that could not be called his own. And what faith can be
reposed in a man who stoops to a practice so dishonourable? But Sir
John's story had not yet reached the end.</p>
<p>"It was after she had gone that he revealed himself," he
resumed. "He stormed and raged, and finally he threatened me."</p>
<p>"Threatened?" echoed the Captain, haled suddenly out of his
musings by that word.</p>
<p>"Ay, threatened&mdash;covertly. He swore that I should bitterly
repent me of that day's work. I ask you, Harry: To what could his
threats have reference? What could be in his mind?"</p>
<p>The Captain expressed his disgust and amazement in an oath. "You
think he would prove such a dastard?"</p>
<p>"At least he considered it&mdash;that is quite plain. Between
considering a villainy and performing it there is but a step. But
there is little occasion for alarm on my behalf. I have been too
cautious; there is not a scrap of evidence against me in existence.
I am well viewed by the Government; any story of my defection must
be discredited, and any man that bears it must place his own neck
in a noose. So do not give it thought. But give thought, I beg of
you, to a man who stoops to consider such means of vengeance, and
ask yourself whether, being dishonourable, as this proves him, and
desperate&mdash;more desperate than ever now&mdash;he would hesitate to use
such means for profit, to extricate himself from his difficulties,
to save him from the spunging-house."</p>
<p>Aghast, the Captain looked at Sir John. Then his expression
changed; he frowned in perplexity. He was considering
something&mdash;considering Lord Pauncefort's assertion that his
difficulties were less desperate than he had feared. Could this
mean, wondered the Captain, that to resolve them he had already
taken some such measure as the baronet was suggesting?</p>
<p>"I have made a long tale of it," said Sir John, "that you may
judge for yourself whether my warning was well-advised or not."</p>
<p>"I thank you, Sir John," replied the Captain. "Indeed, indeed, I
fear me the grounds for your suspicions are most just." Then his
face cleared, and he smiled. "Be assured that I shall move with
caution&mdash;with more than caution, where his lordship is
concerned."</p>
<p>And upon that they parted at last, and Sir John rode away,
attended by a couple of grooms, to seek his brother who lay ill at
Bath.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>Chapter 6. THE ENCHANTED
GARDEN</h2>
<p>Through the grounds of Priory Close a brook winds its course on
its way to the Abbey River. It flows in a little ravine, which,
moat-like, almost completely encircles a wonderful old garden. You
approach it by a path that runs through a plantation of firs on the
south side of the mansion.</p>
<p>By this path, through the green shade that was shot here and
there by golden sunlight, Captain Gaynor took his idle way on the
following morning. It brought him to a rustic bridge, some twenty
paces long, spanning the gap at a height of fifteen feet or more
above the stream. Over this he sauntered leisurely. He paused
midway, and leaning upon the rail, he admired the dense tunnel of
foliage formed by the intertwining of the trees that stood on
either side of the ravine.</p>
<p>It was a cool, sequestered spot, fragrant with the perfume the
sun was drawing from the pines. Somewhere near him throbbed the
full-throated song of a thrush; below him was the murmur and babble
of the brook as it glided swiftly over the mossy boulders of its
bed. Never had the Captain lingered in a spot more peaceful. To his
senses it seemed invested with an air almost of enchantment. He
could understand that to one dwelling there the world and the
affairs of men must shrink to infinitesimal proportions, must seem
puny and unworthy, and ambition the emptiest of human bubbles.</p>
<p>He could understand, he thought, Sir John's own lukewarmness
towards the Cause. The baronet, no doubt, would judge the country's
peace from the ineffable peace of these surroundings, and would
tremble at the thought of its being disturbed, at the thought of
all the bloodshed and misery that must come ere the upheaval was
complete and the erstwhile tranquillity restored.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor sighed thoughtfully, and went on across that
enchanted bridge into the enchanted garden beyond. Through another,
lesser plantation on the farther side, over a carpet of
pine-needles, he came into the blazing sunlight and a riot of
colour, backed by colossal boxwood hedges. These hedges were the
gardens pride. It was divided by them into a series of quadrangular
courts on his right, and they stood at a height of some ten feet,
each with an entrance in the form of an arched gap so narrow that
but one person could enter at a time.</p>
<p>On the left of the pathway which he followed, and which ran the
garden's full length to the distant redbrown wall, was spread an
orchard, all pink and white with blossom, and through the trees in
the distance he espied his host's niece and daughter.</p>
<p>They stood near the brook, in a conversation that the Captain
might have accounted earnest had not the high, trilling note of
Evelyn's laughter reached him across the distance. Thereupon he
took his way towards them, never dreaming that he came to interrupt
an argument whereof he was himself the subject.</p>
<p>It had sprung from Damaris' desire to make an end of the deceit
which had been practised yesterday upon their visitor. She had come
to Evelyn that morning with expressions of regret for her own share
in it, for having consented to it; she had urged the unworthiness
of the thing, the loss of dignity that must attend its ultimate
dissipation, especially if this were now delayed.</p>
<p>"Let us tell Captain Gaynor," she ended, "that in jest we
permitted him to persist in the error into which of his own accord
he fell."</p>
<p>"We can tell him tomorrow or the next day," answered Evelyn
airily. "Besides, I do not admit that the error was originally his
own. That is the incense you offer to your vanity." And thereupon
had trilled out that flute-noted laugh which had caught the
sauntering Captains ears.</p>
<p>A little colour showed in Damaris' cheeks.</p>
<p>"Confess," Evelyn mocked her, "confess now that your concern is
reluctance to show yourself without your gilding."</p>
<p>"You are vastly, cruelly unkind, Evelyn," answered Damaris in
gentle rebuke, and this answer took her cousin by surprise. For
neither Evelyn nor her mother knew of that happening in the library
a week ago, knew or guessed of the wound, the deep, cruel wound
that Damaris had sustained in her affection and her pride. Damaris
was not of those who wring their hands and cry out their wrongs in
public or in private. She had kept her chamber for two days upon
the pretext of a passing ailment, and in that time she had schooled
herself to the dissimulation of her feelings. Contempt had come to
her rescue, the coldly fierce contempt that is the offspring of
disillusion. She was conscious even of a certain thankfulness that
circumstances had vouchsafed her a glimpse of the real man into
whose keeping she would so trustingly have delivered up her life, a
thankfulness for the timeliness of that revelation. In time, no
doubt, this thankfulness would come to be the only abiding feeling
so far as my Lord Pauncefort was concerned. But for the present it
had not yet come to dominance over her pain and her sense of utter
loss.</p>
<p>Desolation and listlessness were her present portion. But of
this the unpercipient Evelyn had no suspicion, for Evelyn studied
no countenance searchingly save her own.</p>
<p>"Unkind?" quoth Evelyn. "La! In what now am I unkind?"</p>
<p>"In your estimate of me. If Captain&mdash;"</p>
<p>A rustle behind her caused her to turn her head, and thus they
became aware of the Captain's approach.</p>
<p>Last night he had come to table in a dove-coloured suit and with
heavily powdered hair, looking&mdash;save for his bronzed face&mdash;the very
perfect courtier. This morning he had resumed his military
exterior. He wore his laced blue coat, uncompromisingly buttoned
from chin to waistband, disdaining the pigeon-breasted mode which
left the upper part to gape and reveal a bulging mass of lace and
linen. White buckskins and spurred jack-boots encased his legs. He
even wore his sword.</p>
<p>Coming up with them he doffed his feathered hat and made a leg
with a certain distinct stiffness, craving their leave to bear them
company.</p>
<p>It was granted him by Evelyn, with a flutter of eyelids and the
demure air of challenge that most men knew in her. And then, with
mischievous intent to perpetuate the confusion of identities&mdash;</p>
<p>"Evelyn," said she, indicating Damaris, "is all pride in her
garden."</p>
<p>"Then," said the Captain, "pride is well placed for once. I have
seen many gardens 'twixt here and far Cathay, but never one in
which there dwelt a peace so joyous. Madam," he addressed himself
to Damaris, and the serious sincerity of his speech robbed it of
any construable impertinence, "your garden repays your pride, for I
think that it does justice to its mistress."</p>
<p>The brown eyes of Damaris met his own a moment, as if she were
appraising the full value of his words; then they passed on; a
faint smile crossed her face, which was of the warm, lustreless
pallor of old ivory, and slightly she bowed her head as if in
courteous acknowledgment.</p>
<p>Now although her eyes had met his own for but a moment, yet in
that fleeting glimpse Captain Gaynor had caught the wistfulness
that inhabited them, and something within him had leapt in response
to something that was near akin to an appeal. This appeal, he knew,
was not to himself; it was to nature, to the world, to heal her of
a sorrow or to satisfy a longing, he knew not which. But it touched
him and in touching seared him and branded him her servant, to heal
or satisfy as her need might be when he should come to understand
it, and if so be that she would accept the service that should be
hers.</p>
<p>Evelyn had looked on with slightly parted lips, a straining
anxiety in her glance, born of fear lest Damaris should there and
then repudiate the identity once more thrust upon her. With her
cousin's silence and its tacit acknowledgment her anxiety passed,
and her rippling, ever-ready laugh expressed her pleasure and
relief. Also it served to dissemble her vexation that the first
compliment to fall from this somewhat chill and distant soldier's
lips should, in spite of all, have been addressed to her
cousin.</p>
<p>A more sweet and fragrant picture of maidenhood than Evelyn
presented this morning it were not easy to discover. She was
arrayed in palest lilac, and her waist, amazingly slender in its
firm encasement, sprang from a white furbelow that hung about her
lightly as a cloud of vapour. The flimsiest of lace tuckers
discreetly veiled the white beauties of neck and bosom, which the
low cut bodice must otherwise reveal. Her hair, very carefully
massed and curled, was of the colour of ripe corn; her eyes,
questing, unrestful and provoking, reflected the flawless sky of
June; her cheeks put to shame the apple blossom under which they
stood. She was soft and silky and very insistently feminine; the
very maid, you would suppose, to compel response in a man so very
masculine as the Captain. Yet it was to Damaris that he chiefly
addressed himself, upon Damaris that his eyes would linger. She
stood a full half-head taller than her cousin, who was small and of
an exquisite roundness. She was dressed now for riding, in a brown,
high-necked habit laced with gold, than which no raiment could have
done more justice to her graceful height, and she wore a looped hat
of black beaver, from which a golden feather trailed over, to
mingle with her dark brown hair. There was in every line of her
something cool, determined and well-knit, as Captain Gaynor noted,
for all that it was not his way to note the points of any
woman.</p>
<p>Their talk was still of that garden and of other gardens which
the Captain in his travels had beheld, to all of which Damaris
contributed but little, and that little only when she was, herself,
directly addressed.</p>
<p>"I knew," he said, "when I stepped upon that bridge that I was
coming at last into the enchanted garden that we have all heard of
in our early youth, and of whose real existence the bitter,
all-desecrating knowledge of later years has made us
sceptical."</p>
<p>"And you have discovered its enchantment?" murmured Evelyn,
scenting here the prologue to a speech of gallantry.</p>
<p>"I think I have," he answered, with an amazing seriousness,
looking straight ahead. He sighed. "The spell of it is already upon
me, I think. Did I unwisely linger I fear that it must overwhelm me
utterly."</p>
<p>He was so sober, so solemn, that Damaris glanced at him, her
keen ears informing her that behind these words of his lay prepared
no such trifling speech as her cousin still expected.</p>
<p>"What is it?" she asked. It was the first time she had
spontaneously addressed him, and his glance met hers again, held it
a moment, and then, still meeting it, seemed to look beyond and
away. Thus may the poet or the fanatic look.</p>
<p>"It is," he said, and his voice sank reverently, "it is that
God's peace&mdash;God's disregarded, priceless gift to man&mdash;is here.
Somewhere here, too, is the tree of true knowledge, for its
essences hang heavily upon the air. To inhale them is to achieve
perception of the true meanness of worldly things, the horror of
strife and bloodshed, the contempt of ambition, which is but a
euphemism for striving selfishness and vainglory. Who that could
dwell here would dwell elsewhere? Who that once has breathed deep
of this fragrance would ever again suffer the world's stews to
offend his nostrils?"</p>
<p>Evelyn&mdash;disappointed Evelyn&mdash;laughed on her high note, a little
mockingly. "I vow, sir," she minced, "that you are vastly
poetical!"</p>
<p>His eye, cold and inscrutable, rested upon her for a moment. He
bowed.</p>
<p>"I thank you, Miss Hollinstone," said he, "for having broke the
spell. Had it persisted it might well have proved the undoing of a
poor soldier."</p>
<p>"What is your regiment, sir?" she asked him. She had something
of her mother's inconsequence.</p>
<p>"I have had many; but I have none now," was his reply. "My last
commission was in the Sultan's army."</p>
<p>"The Sultan?" cried both girls together, so taken aback were
they.</p>
<p>"The Grand Turk," he explained easily. "His cavalry was all
disjointed, and I undertook the office of instructing it. Also I
saw some service against Venice."</p>
<p>Damaris looked at him with incredulous eyes. "You fought against
Christians in the service of the Infidel!" she cried.</p>
<p>"I fought against rogues in the service of rogues, ma'am. That
is the pure truth of it. For the rest, it is not the mercenary's to
do more than choose the service that offers the best pay." He saw
the scorn gathering in her glance. But he did not know upon what
bitter pastures it had been nourished. He did not know that in his
own case, it was the sharper because she accounted that she had
been mistaken in him a moment ago when he had talked of the
garden.</p>
<p>"And do you always," she asked him, "fight for the side that
pays you best?"</p>
<p>"By your leave, ma'am, I should account myself a fool to fight
for the other."</p>
<p>He had not winced before her cool, appraising eye, nor the
half-veiled contempt of her question. He had his part to play&mdash;for
the sake of that master to whose service was to be yielded up the
fruit of all other services. It wounded him&mdash;unreasonably, he
held&mdash;to appear before her in this light. But the necessities
demanded it.</p>
<p>"I have made arms my trade," he explained. "I am a soldier of
fortune, and in all my seeming inconsistencies of service I have
been consistent at least in that I have served Fortune always&mdash;more
stoutly," he added ruefully, "than Fortune has served me."</p>
<p>"How odd!" sighed Damaris; for his bold frankness had beaten
down much of her nascent scorn, yet not quite all. "How very
strange!"</p>
<p>"In what is't strange?" quoth Evelyn, as if defending him.</p>
<p>"Strange that men should sacrifice their best for gold, imperil
their lives and pawn their very honour for the sake of profit."</p>
<p>"Not all men," said the Captain, with his wry smile. "There is
no lack of those who sacrifice all this to dreams and
moonshine&mdash;the gratitude of princes, the favour of the people, the
love of country, immortal renown and other such
intangibilities."</p>
<p>"Do you scorn them?" she challenged him.</p>
<p>"As soldiers, yes," he quibbled. "Their ardour detracts from
their value, robs them of the proper calm, and I have found that
they make but poor opponents to the trained mercenary, who in
battle is all calculation and no heat."</p>
<p>"I speak not of that," said Damaris, "but of their aims, of the
mainspring of their actions&mdash;in short, their loyalty and devotion
to the ideal. Do you scorn that, sir?"</p>
<p>He met her glance quite calmly. "No, ma'am, I do not," said
he.</p>
<p>"Then," she cried, warmed a little by the argument upon which
she was embarked&mdash;and the subject was one very near to her poor,
wounded heart these days&mdash;"then, surely, you must scorn the others,
these mere helots."</p>
<p>"Such as myself?" said he, no shadow of offence in tone or
voice. "Believe me, did I do so I should change my ways. I think
that it is possible to respect both."</p>
<p>Again she measured him with those cool, appraising eyes. She
judged him to be good and clean; honest he had already proved
himself by the very frankness of his admissions in the face of a
scorn that she had scarce attempted to dissemble. She considered
his firm mouth and steely eyes, the very poise of his head and
uprightness of his carriage, and from it all she gathered
intuitively a sense that he was true metal&mdash;a man to be relied
upon, a man to whom the weak and the oppressed would turn by very
instinct, a man who would never hurt the honour of a fellow-man, a
man in whom a woman might place her trust.</p>
<p>Because her intuitions showed her all this in him, she desired
to understand a point of view that seemed to contradict it all;
perhaps she even thought to combat his views, to reveal to him the
unworthiness in his aims which was all so clear to her.</p>
<p>"I cannot think," answered she, "I cannot think that respect is
due to one who makes a trade of that which should be the expression
of profound convictions. Life is surely as sacred a gift as honour,
and to adventure it for gold cannot be other than unworthy. If war
must be, if men must fight, surely it should be in defence of
liberty, of right, of high ideals. Surely there is naught else can
justify the risk of life; and to risk life from any other
mainspring must be at least a little&mdash;base."</p>
<p>She would have added more, but meeting his glance again, seeing
him so calm and so entirely unruffled, the ghost of a smile
hovering upon his tight lips, she checked. A wave of colour swept
across her face. "Forgive me," she begged, "if I have said more
than I should. After all, I think I am not so much reproving&mdash;to
which, indeed, I have no shadow of right&mdash;as seeking
information."</p>
<p>He laughed gently, on that deep musical note of his. "Indeed, I
am relieved," said he. "For I began to fear you lacked for charity
in your judgment."</p>
<p>"Indeed, yes," put in Evelyn, who perceived at last a chance of
intervention. "And particularly now that you are come to offer your
sword to your own country."</p>
<p>"Nay, but that is worse," he exclaimed. "It is to say that I see
the error of my ways, and am come to mend them?"</p>
<p>"And is't not so?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Why, no," said he. But it was to Damaris that he seemed to
speak. "It is that I lack employment elsewhere."</p>
<p>He found her troubled eyes regarding him with less of scorn than
pity now, and it was that glance he answered when he said: "And yet
I do not say that if I found a cause that were worth serving for
its own sake I should be slow to serve it, perhaps even to my
loss."</p>
<p>"I think you would," said Evelyn, those questing, provoking eyes
of hers enveloping him in their regard.</p>
<p>He bowed somewhat formally in acknowledgment. "Meanwhile," said
he, "I must beware the seduction of this enchanted garden ere its
magic prove the undoing of a wandering mercenary."</p>
<p>A liveried groom approached them through the trees, and Evelyn,
who was the first to see him, announced his coming, and its
object.</p>
<p>"Here is Gibbs, sweet cousin," said she, "to inquire if you will
ride the nag you bade him saddle."</p>
<p>She conceived that at last she would be rid of Damaris and would
have the Captain entirely to herself. From this you are not to
gather that the captain, <i>per se</i>, was of any account to her.
He was of account in that he was a male, and so, thought she, a
proper person to burn incense on the altar of her little vanity;
further he was of account that she might make good upon him her
challenge to her cousin&mdash;a challenge which at the moment was
proving a source of considerable alarm to her.</p>
<p>But it so chanced that the Captain had not come forth in
jack-boots and spurs to saunter all the morning in a garden. He too
was minded to ride, as he now announced.</p>
<p>"And so, Miss Kynaston," he ended, addressing Damaris, "if you
will suffer me to be your escort, you may repay me by acting as my
guide over a countryside with which I am unacquainted. You see that
in all things I am true to my mercenary's character."</p>
<p>She hesitated a moment, whereupon he bowed submissively, as to a
refusal.</p>
<p>"It was presumptuous in me to proffer even for payment a service
which I had not first ascertained to be desired," he said. "Ladies,
I am your obedient, grateful servant."</p>
<p>He swept them both a bow, and was turning to depart, when
Damaris stayed him.</p>
<p>"You are very quick, sir, to suppose me churlish."</p>
<p>Evelyn's eyes were sparkling angrily, and Damaris observed it,
but was not deterred. It were a gross discourtesy to a guest to
allow him to depart thus. "I shall be glad to ride with you, sir,"
she smiled, "upon the terms you name."</p>
<p>What time the furious and humiliated Evelyn&mdash;for humiliated she
felt herself by the turn events were taking&mdash;was inveighing to her
sympathetic mother against the shameless wiles of Damaris and her
brazen conduct towards the other sex, Damaris and the Captain rode
through the green lanes of Surrey attended by the groom Gibbs, who
followed at a respectful distance.</p>
<p>It proved a fruitful ride for both of them, and for Damaris even
more than for him. She drew him into talk of himself, of his
travels, the countries he had seen and the many services in which
his mercenary's sword had been engaged. And he talked frankly and
entertainingly. The absence of that boastfulness of exploits so
usual in his kind went far to impress her favourably, confirming
much of the judgment of him which already she had formed.</p>
<p>That ride did much to heal the bruises that her gentle heart had
taken a week ago. In the Captain's company she seemed to be
regaining something of that buoyancy which but yesterday she
fancied had left her for all time.</p>
<p>The image of Pauncefort faded in her mind to a proper
insignificance. She drew a parallel between him and this man beside
her, and she seemed to discover that if once she had set his
lordship upon a pedestal and gone near to worshipping him, it was
because in the seclusion in which her youth had been passed it had
been hers never to meet a real man.</p>
<p>But at the root of all was that foolish compact she had made
with Evelyn, which she had so keenly regretted and to which that
very morning she had sought to set an end. Had she but done so, how
differently must she now be feeling, with what suspicions, with
what convictions of unworthy motives in him must she now be
regarding the frank and pleasant comradeship of this soldier of
fortune; how the regard he had been quick to show her must have but
served to increase the bitterness she had been carrying in her
heart&mdash;a bitterness of which, all being as it was, he was gradually
and surely effacing all trace.</p>
<p>She rejoiced now in that compact&mdash;rejoiced as only one who had
been through her torment of disillusion could rejoice. What matter
that its ultimate disclosure must be attended by some loss of
dignity? Here was one who was a self-proclaimed mercenary, a man
whose life was dedicated to Fortune's service. In such a one the
pursuit of the wealthy heiress Damaris Hollinstone was the thing to
be expected. How potent then must have been the magnet that had
drawn him as completely from her whom he believed to be that person
as though she had never been in existence.</p>
<p>The fact is that Captain Gaynor had come into the life of
Damaris Hollinstone in an hour of crisis. Coming then, the flattery
of his obvious preference and regard, which in another
season&mdash;whether he believed her to be Damaris or Evelyn&mdash;would have
been to her a very trifling matter, was now a flattery most sweet
and healing.</p>
<p>By the time they reached Priory Close again, Damaris was
actually grateful in her heart to Evelyn for the deception that
earlier had vexed her. And she was as reluctant now as earlier she
had been eager, to set a term to it.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>Chapter 7. EVELYN'S
CONSCIENCE</h2>
<p>It is to be feared that in the week that ensued the real aims of
Captain Gaynor's visit to England engaged his attention but
indifferently. The spell of the garden was upon him, or else the
spell of one of its most constant inhabitants. The brook that
wandered through it became to him symbolical of the Lethean waters.
Oblivious of past and future, he lived but in the present like any
lotus-eater, and if there was a thing to vex him in those brief,
happy summer days it was the consideration of the
character&mdash;truthful in much and in much else untruthful, as we
know&mdash;in which necessity had demanded that he should appear to
Damaris. Yet, when all is said, it did not seem that he must suffer
for it at her hands; notwithstanding her betrayal of scorn when he
had first divulged it to her, yet he observed that she did not on
that account avoid him. But he was not to know that it was on that
very account that his society was welcome and that she admitted him
to her confidence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the deception on the score of identities continued to
be practised upon him, though more than once it had gone very near
to shipwreck at the hands of servants and in other almost
inevitable ways. But it was Evelyn who steered it clear in every
shallow, compelled to it for all the reluctance and vexation that
had now come upon her. For she found the tables most ludicrously
turned.</p>
<p>Supported by her mother, she had taxed Damaris with
unmaidenliness of conduct when on the second morning of the
Captain's visit her cousin had made her appearance dressed again
for riding.</p>
<p>Quite calmly had Damaris stood to listen to Evelyn's
denunciation. She had wasted upon it no shadow of indignation.
Conscious in her own mind that her conduct was above criticism,
conscious no less of the true mainsprings of the criticism that was
offered, she received it with the contempt it merited, met it with
a bantering defiance that revealed how swiftly now she was
recovering her habitual spirit.</p>
<p>"Why, Evelyn," she protested, "I am doing no more than you have
forced upon me."</p>
<p>"Forced upon you? I?" cried Evelyn, round eyes staring.</p>
<p>"Did you not insist that you would be Damaris Hollinstone and
that I should be Evelyn Kynaston? As the supposed daughter of his
host, the Captain has a right to look for certain attentions from
me in my father's absence. To withhold them were to be neglectful
of the common duties of hospitality, and I would not be that for
Sir John's sake."</p>
<p>"Why, that is true now," purred Lady Kynaston. "Yes, that is
very true. I have always said that hospitality is the duty of an
English lady."</p>
<p>Evelyn almost choked with anger. "I think," said she, "that the
sooner we resume our proper identities the better will it be."</p>
<p>Alarm leapt in the soul of Damaris&mdash;this Damaris who had been so
reluctant to lend herself to the duplicity, who had considered it
unworthy and undignified. But her face remained calm, her eyes even
smiled.</p>
<p>"'Tis what I have always held, and I am glad that at last you
agree with me. I shall leave you, then, to enlighten the
Captain."</p>
<p>"Why not enlighten him yourself?"</p>
<p>"Because I am sure it will become you better. Let us consider
now what you shall say. You will tell him that misliking such
admiration as you have observed bestowed upon your cousin Damaris,
but being persuaded that this was a tribute entirely to her
fortune, you induced her to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Am I mad, d'ye think?" cried Evelyn, with an angry stamp of her
satin-clad foot.</p>
<p>"Well, then, say what you please; but be very sure that such is
the construction which he must place upon anything that you tell
him. There is not room for any other."</p>
<p>"I think you wish the deception to continue," Evelyn
announced.</p>
<p>"I am indifferent," answered Damaris. "You have forced me into a
part, and I must play it until you relieve me of it again.
Throughout I have been entirely passive. Never so much as once have
I addressed you as 'Damaris' to aid the deception."</p>
<p>"What deceit!" exclaimed the scandalised Evelyn. "What unworthy
quibbles! You have aided it by your silence."</p>
<p>"So much I admit, and by your leave, Evelyn, my dear, I will
continue in silence."</p>
<p>"From the first I disapproved of it," sighed Lady Kynaston. "You
see in what a difficulty it has placed you."</p>
<p>"I understand," said Evelyn slowly. Her cheeks were burning, as
were her eyes. "Oh, I understand you!"</p>
<p>"I gravely doubt it," answered Damaris.</p>
<p>But Evelyn laughed her confidence and her scorn. Judging all
women's natures by her own, conceiving that the admiration shown by
the other sex must be the mainspring of every woman's being as it
was of hers, she fancied that she held the explanation of her
cousin's indifference on the score of the revelation to be made.
Damaris, having won the Captain's regard in the character of Evelyn
Kynaston, was confident of holding it still more securely as Miss
Hollinstone the heiress. Thus Evelyn judged, and judging thus her
anger increased. It increased further at the reflection that there
was no way out of the situation she had herself created save that
which Damaris indicated. She even exaggerated the matter, for she
was not true-sighted. In no way, she thought, could the
explanation, when it came, be hurtful or humiliating to Damaris;
but it might, it must be humiliating to herself. Finding that the
weapons she had hitherto employed were shivered in her hands, she
turned to snatch fresh and more formidable ones.</p>
<p>"You are forgetting Lord Pauncefort," she said tartly.</p>
<p>"I am endeavouring to do so," Damaris admitted, though in a
fuller sense.</p>
<p>Evelyn stared. "You confess it!" she exclaimed. "Mother, you
hear her! Oh, never could I have believed you so shameless,
Damaris, so lost to all sense of what you owe yourself. Never!"</p>
<p>"I am glad you should have held me in such high esteem," was the
smiling answer. And then, suddenly realising the pettiness of this
battle, the unworthiness of it, her manner changed and she advanced
towards Evelyn with hands outheld. "Come, Evelyn dear, let us call
a truce," she besought her cousin.</p>
<p>"A truce?" echoed Evelyn. "A truce to what, pray?"</p>
<p>"To foolish, bitter words and unfriendly glances."</p>
<p>"Cease, then, to deserve them," was the ungracious answer.</p>
<p>A wan little smile crept into Damaris' face, her patience
inexhaustible. She turned to her aunt.</p>
<p>"Mother dear," she besought her, "can you not move her to a
gentler mood?"</p>
<p>"She means you well, dear Damaris," was Lady Kynaston's answer.
"Hence her concern for you. I must confess that I do not think you
show a proper regard for your betrothal to Lord Pauncefort. He
would not be pleased did he know how you receive Captain Gaynor's
assiduous attentions."</p>
<p>"How she receives them!" Evelyn apostrophised the ceiling. "O
la!"</p>
<p>"My betrothal to Lord Pauncefort&mdash;" Damaris began, and there she
checked. She could not submit herself to all the examination which
her announcement must provoke; she could not suffer to parade
before Evelyn's eyes the shame that in secret she had endured, the
humiliation she had borne. Since yesterday that shame had been
diminished, the humiliation fading. But these feelings were strong
again within her now that she came to the point of alluding to
them. Therefore she paused. "Heigho!" she sighed, with a rueful
smile. And upon that she moved leisurely towards the door.</p>
<p>"Do you intend to ride daily with Captain Gaynor?" her cousin
flung after her.</p>
<p>"You mistake, Evelyn," came the soft answer. "It is not a
question of what I intend, nor have I any intentions in the matter.
But should Captain Gaynor desire to ride daily, as the daughter of
his host I am under the necessity of showing him some attention in
my father's absence. Blame none but yourself for this if you do not
find it meet with your approval." And upon that she took her
departure, leaving Evelyn in a mood of which her poor mother was to
appreciate the bitterness.</p>
<p>Saving for similar daily scenes, that week to Damaris was as
happy a season as it was to Harry Gaynor. Ere it was sped, the
desolation left in her soul by Lord Pauncefort's self-revelation
was changed to a glad thankfulness.</p>
<p>From Sir John in Bath came letters to announce that his
brother's condition, although still critical, was hopeful, and that
soon he trusted to be able to return. For Captain Gaynor came a
brief special note, in which the baronet gracefully regretted his
continued absence at such a season and closed with a veiled
reminder of his warning touching Pauncefort&mdash;a warning which roused
the soldier from the dream in which he had been living to a
consciousness of the perils that surrounded him, for the morrow was
the day appointed for that fateful meeting at "The Worlds End."</p>
<p>So when the morrow came&mdash;it was a Thursday, completing the
little cycle of a week since his advent at Priory Close&mdash;he
announced to the ladies that he must ride to town that afternoon;
that he desired to see the Second Secretary and spur his memory on
the matter that lay between them. "Your idleness, no doubt, is
fretting you, sir," said Evelyn.</p>
<p>"And you must find life very dull in this quiet corner of the
world," her mother added as a corollary.</p>
<p>"Not dull, ma'am, but too happy," he replied. "I dare not forget
that sooner or later other things&mdash;of a vastly different
quality&mdash;await me."</p>
<p>Damaris said nothing. As she sipped her chocolate her mind lost
itself in the mazes of a dream. She was wondering whether it was
the mercenary's nature to rest contentedly, to abandon the
adventurous life for one of peace. If it were not&mdash;Ah, if it were
not&mdash;That was a thought she dared not pursue. She feared; her soul
faltered when she had got thus far, and there she halted, content
to wait.</p>
<p>That morning she rode forth alone&mdash;save for her groom&mdash;for the
first time since the Captain's coming. An appalling loneliness&mdash;a
loneliness that was full of amazing and disquieting
self-revelation&mdash;kept her company. She thought of Pauncefort that
morning, and she thought of him with kindness. She owed him a debt,
she discovered. For without the lesson that she had received at his
lordship's hands she would never have come by so swift a knowledge
of the sterling qualities of her Captain&mdash;this mercenary who moved
adventurously without ideals and whom she had begun by despising
for his avowed pursuit of fortune.</p>
<p>She saw Captain Gaynor again at dinner&mdash;they dined at three
o'clock at Priory Close, too early by at least an hour to satisfy
the mode. And from her window, discreetly hidden, she watched him
ride out on his great black horse, watched his blue-coated figure
along the white ribbon of road until it vanished, and so left her
lonely again.</p>
<p>And whilst she sat alone in her chamber there, below stairs
Evelyn was spurring her mother to perform what Evelyn conceived to
be her mother's duty in the absence of Sir John.</p>
<p>"You must write to his lordship, mother," she was saying, "and
inform him of what is taking place."</p>
<p>"Nay, now, but what is taking place?" quoth her mother
querulously. She had a distaste for being drawn into situations
that might afterwards require to be eased by explanation.</p>
<p>Evelyn shrugged impatiently. Those hungry, questing eyes of hers
were very angry. "Do you need to ask me, mother?"</p>
<p>"Let us await your father's return, child," the mother pleaded.
"He will know best. And meanwhile the Captain has gone."</p>
<p>"But he will return tomorrow."</p>
<p>"How do you know that? He may be given this appointment he is
seeking, and so may return no more."</p>
<p>Evelyn smiled, contemptuous in her assurance that there existed
at Priory Close a magnet to draw him back in spite of anything that
might betide.</p>
<p>"Then I will write myself."</p>
<p>"Evelyn, I forbid you."</p>
<p>"My father is absent, and my mother will not use her eyes. What
help have I? I hope I have a conscience. It is for Damaris' sake.
What, after all, do we know of this adventurer?"</p>
<p>"Nay, now, you must not speak so of him," her ladyship
remonstrated. "His father was your father's dearest friend. Your
father loves the Captain as a son."</p>
<p>Evelyn looked at her mother a moment. Then she turned away and
went without another word to write the following letter:</p>
<blockquote>MY LORD,&mdash;My great regard for your lordship bids me
delay no longer in writing to tell you that if you would not see
that which you most value lost to you, you had best make haste to
come to Priory Close. There is one here who is very like to steal
away from you that which you cherish most in all the world. I send
you this timely warning.<br>
<br>
EVELYN KYNASTON</blockquote>
<p>Having written, Evelyn paused. Within her a voice&mdash;a little
mocking voice&mdash;was proclaiming that what she performed was an act
of purest spite. She crimsoned and took up the sheet to tear it
across. Then she paused.</p>
<p>"I am too sensitive," she assured herself. "Clearly it is my
duty, since my mother will not. Damaris' future happiness depends
on't." Which, after all, was very true.</p>
<p>But it was not until next morning that the letter sped to London
by her messenger.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>Chapter 8. AT "THE WORLD'S
END"</h2>
<p>Standing on the outskirts of the pleasant village of Chelsea, as
one of London's western outposts, "The Worlds End" was a house of
great comings and goings, of much bustle and consequence. Hence had
it been preferred by Captain Gaynor to any quieter hostelry for the
business which he desired to transact. In the constant ebb and flow
of travellers to and from the Metropolis there was but little
chance that any particular man or group of men would attract more
than passing notice. Moreover, Maclean, its Scottish landlord, was
a circumspect but ardent Jacobite, and the house had yet the
additional advantage of being&mdash;both on the score of its remoteness
and of its traffic&mdash;a most unlikely place for such a meeting.</p>
<p>It stood a little way back from the King's Road&mdash;which runs from
St James's to Hampton Court&mdash;fronted by a patch of turf on which
were planted a couple of trestle-tables flanked by plain wooden
forms, and it looked out over a stretch of meadowland that sloped
gently to the river.</p>
<p>Before its doors on this June evening the wonted bustle was
toward. A great black and yellow stagecoach on its way to London
was drawn up on the very edge of the patch of turf, and the
hoarse-voiced driver passed the time of the day with the ostler in
terms which knew little of decorum and less of dainty ears. A
nobleman's travelling chaise, a sombre mass of wood and leather
drawn by six horses and with bold escutcheons on its panels, stood
cheek by jowl with the stage, but facing westward.</p>
<p>About these was a huddle of lesser craft, a post-chaise, a
couple of hackney coaches, a carrier's cart, and lastly, stretching
adown the road in line like the tail of a kite, some half-dozen
waggons on their way to market for the following day. To increase
the general bustle and to swell the throng there were men on
horseback and men on foot, watermen from the moored barges and
wherries, grooms, ostlers, drivers and waggoners, whilst a motley
company derived from all of these sat about the trestle-tables over
their ale, a noisy, babbling, quarrelling, laughing assembly.</p>
<p>Into this scene of activity rode Captain Gaynor at a little
after eight o'clock of that summer evening&mdash;the hour appointed for
the meeting of those six confederates who were to receive from him
and in their turn disseminate those messages of which he was the
bearer and of which he carried upon him a note in cipher. The
substance of those messages has not survived, and there are no
means today of ascertaining the details of the precise plot that
was the object of this particular mission of Captain Gaynor. Whilst
regrettable from the point of view of historical research, from our
own it is a matter of little moment, since we are here concerned
with the personal history of Captain Gaynor and not with that of
any of the perennially budding Jacobite conspiracies.</p>
<p>We gather from stray records that have come down to us&mdash;and more
particularly from the bulky memoirs which were penned by Mr Second
Secretary Templeton to while the tedium of his subsequent
retirement from office&mdash;that this was one of the earlier of those
conspiracies which ultimately were to prove the undoing of that
ambitious, plotting cleric, Atterbury; for we are able very plainly
to trace that this mission of the notorious Jacobite agent,
"Captain Jenkyn"&mdash;who was hanged at Tyburn under the extraordinary
circumstances with which we are directly concerned&mdash;was undertaken
at the Bishops urgent instances.</p>
<p>To receive Captain Gaynor, as he drew rein on the outskirts of
that throng, came a shock-headed, sweating, surpliced ostler, who
was thrust aside almost immediately by a younger man. That the
ostler submitted without demur showed that the youth who usurped
his functions on this occasion was a person of some authority, as
did indeed the latter's garments which, though of plain homespun,
indicated a station superior to a groom's. He was, in fact,
Maclean's son, set by the vintner to watch for the Captain's
coming.</p>
<p>Harry Gaynor tossed his reins to the youngster, and swung
himself lightly from the saddle.</p>
<p>"I stay but a little while," he said, "so keep my nag saddled
for me."</p>
<p>With that he pushed forward through the throng about the door, a
throng which before his brisk, authoritative manner opened a way
for him readily enough. He strode into a narrow, flagged passage
upon which the taproom door stood open. From this issued sounds of
voices and a reek of tobacco. Under the lintel leaned a tall,
loose-limbed man in his shirt-sleeves with an apron girt about him.
He turned at the sound of the Captain's steps, and disclosed the
mellow, jovial face of Maclean.</p>
<p>His eyes welcomed the guest, and the Captain's returned that
welcome. It was as if they had clasped hands. With the other
Jacobites who were assembled above stairs there had been question
and answer on the score of wants to veil the giving of password and
countersign. But Captain Gaynor was known to the vintner.</p>
<p>"Ha, landlord!" quoth the soldier, after that real greeting of
the eyes. "A pint of claret laced with Nantes!"</p>
<p>"At once, your Honour," replied Maclean, in formal landlord's
tones.</p>
<p>The Captain stood halting upon the threshold of the taproom.</p>
<p>"Ye're somewhat crowded here," he said, and coughed as if the
smoke had jarred his windpipe.</p>
<p>"There is another room above," Maclean replied, approving the
Captain's easy acting. "Will you be pleased to go up, sir?"</p>
<p>The soldier turned and made for the stairs. "The first door to
the right, your Honour," Maclean called after him. "I'll bring the
claret." He coughed significantly, and Captain Gaynor, turning as
he went up, caught from the host's quick, expressive gestures that
the door he was to take was on the left instead. He nodded his
understanding, and went on. He knew the chamber from another visit
some two years ago. It was peculiarly well fitted for a secret
meeting in such a place, access being gained to it across another
room, through a door that looked for all the world like that of a
cupboard in the wall.</p>
<p>But as he went he was puzzled by the almost excessive caution
which the landlord had shown, by the loud announcement that the
door was on the right followed by a correcting gesture. Maclean,
the Captain reflected, must have some good reason for this, some
notion that there was a spy at hand.</p>
<p>Such a notion Maclean had, indeed, and his suspicions on that
score were almost immediately changed to certainty. For as he
turned he found himself confronted in the doorway of the taproom by
the very object of his suspicions&mdash;a burly fellow in snuff-coloured
clothes, in whom he had sniffed a Bow Street messenger. This man
had sat apart, unobtrusive, in a corner of the taproom whence he
could command the passage, and for all his unobtrusiveness&mdash;or,
perhaps, because of it&mdash;Maclean had furtively watched him with
increasing mistrust. He had taken care when Captain Gaynor entered
so to place himself before the soldier as to screen him from the
prying eyes of that suspected spy. And it was with the intention of
misleading that same watcher that he had uttered aloud his
misdirection.</p>
<p>Confronted now by the man, and his every suspicion thus
confirmed, Maclean, affecting to await the fellow's commands,
effectively barred his way until it should be too late for him to
perceive the real direction taken by the Captain.</p>
<p>"What d'ye lack, sir?" was his formal question, smiling his
anxiety to supply the needs of this guest&mdash;and in that smile
dissembling the greater anxiety which this guest occasioned
him.</p>
<p>The fellow coughed affectedly. "This reek of tobacco smoke,"
said he, "is more than I can suffer. I'll go upstairs to this other
room of yours."</p>
<p>Maclean made way with a bow and a readiness that were entirely
disarming.</p>
<p>"Pray do so," said he, and waved a hand towards the stairs. "The
room is on the right. You'll find some company there. I'll send a
drawer to wait on you."</p>
<p>The burly spy&mdash;for a spy he was, and moreover had a warrant in
his pocket and six men at his orders outside at the
trestle-tables&mdash;felt himself checked by the landlord's ease and the
readiness with which the way was opened for him. Maclean was a born
conspirator, a man who knew how a plot should be laid if it were to
baffle discovery. To mask that meeting above stairs against
precisely such a contingency as the present one, he had placed a
room above at the disposal of such of his guests as appeared to be
persons of quality, and it was into this room that the spy now
thrust himself, notwithstanding the loss of confidence occasioned
him by the landlord's imperturbability.</p>
<p>He found himself in the company of some dozen gentlemen who eyed
him somewhat askance, a circumstance which reawakened fading
suspicions. The assembly was, it is true, rather more numerous than
he had been led to look for, and he observed that it was broken
into detached groups of twos and threes. These, surely, could not
be his quarry. Yet, being a man so suspicious of ruses that he saw
ruses where none existed, considered innocence itself the most
damning mark of guilt, the messenger sat down in a corner, and,
when presently approached by a drawer, ordered himself a nipperkin
of ale. But the scrutiny to which he furtively submitted each
separate group and each member of it gradually convinced him that
either he had been deliberately led or else was fallen into error.
This conviction was complete when anon the door opened to admit a
couple of fresh arrivals, the first of whom was a portly, pompous
man in a full-bottomed wig, in whom the messenger recognised Sir
Henry Thresh, one of the Middlesex justices.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Captain Gaynor had crossed the empty room on the left
of the passage, and through that deceptive narrow double-door had
entered the farther apartment, where his friends awaited him.</p>
<p>This was a small chamber facing westward and flooded now with
the roseate glow of sunset. It was very plainly furnished, and
about a polished, oblong walnut table in mid-apartment sat four
gentlemen over their wine. A crystal bowl of water&mdash;inevitable
appendage to every Jacobite gathering&mdash;occupied the middle of the
board and shed upon it a wedge of prismatic light. Near this pipes
had been placed, a tinder-box and a leaden jar of cut tobacco; but
only one member of the company&mdash;an extremely tall and slender young
man, very fine in a green riding-suit with white satin linings&mdash;was
smoking. This gentleman had dark, vivacious eyes and a pleasant
face under an extremely modish and ample periwig; his name was
Partridge, and he was said to be a person of considerable
importance in Wiltshire.</p>
<p>Of the other three, two were men of forty or thereabouts. One
was Viscount Harewood, a gentleman with whom allegiance to the
Stuarts was a family matter, since he claimed the patriarchal
second Charles for his grandsire. Indeed, some resemblance to that
too-merry monarch was to be discerned in his lordship's swarthy
tint and saturnine cast of countenance; the other was Mr Stephen
Dyke, a pale, hawk-faced man in a brown bag-wig. The last member of
that quartette was the staunch and almost brazen Jacobite, Sir
Thomas Leigh. He was much older than his companions, very tall and
straight nevertheless, with something military in his air and
carriage, and something military, too, in the vigorous oaths with
which his speech was peppered, for he had seen service in the late
queen's days. In countenance he was fresh-complexioned, frank and
jovial.</p>
<p>They rose to welcome Captain Gaynor, who came a full quarter of
an hour behind the time appointed for the meeting; yet, as he
perceived, he was not the last to arrive. Lord Pauncefort and an
Irish man named O'Neill were still awaited. He made his excuses and
sat down to await with them their missing confederates, giving them
meanwhile such news as they sought, until they were interrupted by
the entrance of Maclean with the Captain's claret.</p>
<p>Having set down the jug and glass, the vintner leaned a hand
upon the table, and addressing himself more particularly to Captain
Gaynor, he gravely announced the presence in the house of one whom
he suspected of being a spy.</p>
<p>They listened in consternation and in silence, with the
exception of old Sir Thomas, who let fly a volley of sulphuric
oaths which no one heeded.</p>
<p>"What do you counsel us to do, Maclean?" was Captain Gaynor's
quiet question.</p>
<p>"Why, do the business upon which you are come, gentlemen. The
rogue is safe bestowed for the present, watching the guests in
another room across the passage. I had disposed against any such
surprise as this. And, after all," he ended, "it is not impossible
that he is after other quarry than yourselves. Still, I thought it
well to set you on your guard."</p>
<p>He withdrew upon that, leaving relief behind him; for all but
one accepted as certain the supposition that the Bow Street
messenger might be on the spoor of other game.</p>
<p>"It must be so, egad!" cried Harewood. "Else were we betrayed,
and that is not possible."</p>
<p>"Not possible, indeed," agreed Sir Thomas. "The fellow will be
some thief-taker on the trail of a tobyman belike. Maclean starts
at shadows."</p>
<p>But Captain Gaynor did not share their confidence. Pauncefort's
absence fretted him. The mistrust implanted in his breast by Sir
John Kynaston and what he had learnt from him was stirring uneasily
now.</p>
<p>"I wonder where the plague these others tarry," he muttered, and
then almost immediately to answer him the door opened and O'Neill
reeled into the room.</p>
<p>There is no other way in which to describe his entrance. He was
a red-headed youngster, whose face was usually florid and
mischievously good-humoured. It was of a deathly pallor now, and
clammy; his blue eyes were a thought wild. His boots were white
with dust, and all about him there was an air of haste, disorder
and alarm.</p>
<p>His advent brought the others to their feet. Questions rained
upon him on the score of his condition.</p>
<p>He sank to a chair, snatched up a glass of Nantes that belonged
to Sir Thomas, and unceremoniously drained it. Then he explained
himself quite tersely.</p>
<p>"The game is up, gentlemen." He rolled his eyes about the
company that stood above him. "'Tis betrayed we are; undone
entirely."</p>
<p>There fell a pause, all eyes upon this bearer of ill tidings.
Then Lord Harewood fired a question.</p>
<p>"By whom?" quoth he, so fiercely that had the betrayer heard him
he must have looked to his skin.</p>
<p>"I don't know," was the answer, "and faith 'tis the only thing I
don't know. We've been sold&mdash;devil a doubt of that, and 'tis a
miracle I am here to tell you of it. Clinton, Brownrigg, Holmdale,
Spencer Gamlin and Sir Vernon Bewick have been arrested today upon
warrants. Other arrests are to follow&mdash;yours, Harewood, and yours,
Sir Thomas."</p>
<p>"Let them arrest me and be damned to them," said the stalwart
veteran. "What else?"</p>
<p>"There's a warrant for myself too, bedad, and you may be
thankful for't, as otherwise I should never have had any warning at
all."</p>
<p>Came a fresh volley of questions, quelled at last by Captain
Gaynor. He spoke for the first time since O'Neill's arrival.</p>
<p>"Shall we discuss this matter calmly, gentlemen," said he. "Thus
shall we make the better speed, and time may be of more consequence
than we deem. Will you be seated?"</p>
<p>He spoke in a crisp voice of authority. Outwardly he was the
calmest&mdash;indeed, the only calm&mdash;man in that room. He was instantly
obeyed. They realised that in this extremity a leader was needed,
and the natural leader, as much by the position which his mission
gave him as by his natural endowments, was Captain Gaynor. They sat
down at once, and the Captain sat down with them.</p>
<p>He was familiar with desperate situations, and he had been too
long an actor to permit himself now to be surprised into a betrayal
of his true feelings. And so he remained outwardly as unmoved as if
the thing before them were but of trifling import. Inwardly his
soul sickened. Years of planning were overthrown thus at a blow.
All was to do again, it seemed; and heaven alone knew whether he
would live to be in at the ultimate victory which he was assured
God must accord the right. Yet nothing of this showed in his
countenance. If it was stern and singularly hard, it had all the
calm that goes with hardness.</p>
<p>He took up one of the long-stemmed pipes, and began deliberately
to fill it from the leaden jar.</p>
<p>"Firstly," he said, his voice very quiet and even, "will you
tell us, Mr O'Neill, how you come by your knowledge?"</p>
<p>"I have it," answered O'Neill at once, leaning forward across
the table, "from my cousin, Jocelyn Butler, who is my Lord
Carteret's private secretary. 'Twas his own hand prepared the
warrants by my lord's directions, and had not my own been among the
names we should never have had this warning. As it was, Jocelyn
came to me soon after six this evening, as I was on the point of
setting out&mdash;in fact, 'tis what delayed me. At first he told me no
more than there was a warrant out for my arrest on a charge of
conspiring against the peace of the realm, and urged me to take
horse and begone at once. But I swore I wouldn't stir a foot until
he had told me all there was to't.</p>
<p>"He demurred awhile, but bethinking him that 'twill be the talk
of the town by morning, and that as most of the arrests were made
already 'twas little he'ld be betrayin', he spoke out, and told me
all he knew, or leastways all that I asked him, and I asked him all
that mattered. Thereupon I rode hither as fast as horse could bring
me, for amongst other things my cousin told me that the messengers
from Bow Street were on their way hither to surprise a meeting of
plotters."</p>
<p>There was a stir about the table.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Captain Gaynor. "That, too, was known, then, eh?" He
reached for the tinder-box as he spoke.</p>
<p>"Faith, yes. But glory be to heaven, I've arrived ahead of
them."</p>
<p>"'Sblud! But ye've not," roared Sir Thomas Leigh, and hubbub
broke out afresh, through which O'Neill listened in increasing
alarm to the announcement that one of the messengers was here
already.</p>
<p>"And what's to be done, then?" he cried.</p>
<p>"That we will now consider," said the Captain, and by the very
tone of his voice restored order about the table. He struck steel
against flint, and having kindled a flame applied it to his pipe.
Then "You did not learn," he inquired, "whether Lord Pauncefort had
been arrested?"</p>
<p>"I learnt that he had not."</p>
<p>"But a warrant will have been issued for him, of course?"</p>
<p>"Not so. I asked that, too, and I was relieved to learn that he,
at least, has been overlooked."</p>
<p>"Overlooked? How very fortunate," said Captain Gaynor, with the
faintest note of irony. Sir John Kynaston's warning was humming now
in his mind. "This being so, can any here suggest why my Lord
Pauncefort is not with us?"</p>
<p>A hush followed that significant question, broken at last by
Harewood, who was Pauncefort's friend.</p>
<p>"Now, sink me, Captain Gaynor, what is't you mean by that?" And
his swarthy face was flushed by sudden anger.</p>
<p>"Before I answer you, my lord," said the soldier, maintaining
his outward calm, "let me ask you all a question. Has anyone of you
mentioned to a living soul that we were to assemble here tonight?
If any has, I entreat him to speak frankly now in the interests of
us all."</p>
<p>Followed a little spell of silence; then from one and another
broke firm and sturdy denials.</p>
<p>"I will remind you, then," said the Captain, "that no living man
knew of this meeting save those who were to assemble&mdash;ourselves
present, and one other who is absent."</p>
<p>"There is yet one other&mdash;Maclean," Mr Partridge reminded the
Captain.</p>
<p>"Ay!" roared Harewood. "What of Maclean?"</p>
<p>Gaynor's smile and a little gesture with the fingers that held
his pipe brushed aside the question as frivolous.</p>
<p>"Maclean did not know the names of those who were to assemble,
and you will bear in mind that Mr O'Neill has told us that the
warrants are out with those names set forth. Maclean could not have
possessed such knowledge. Nor yet, had he possessed it, could he
have betrayed it without running his own neck into a noose, and
there is still the further trifling matter in his favour that 'twas
he, himself, brought us word of the presence of the messenger.</p>
<p>"You must see, sirs, that there is but one person could have
betrayed us to this extent; his absence more than confirms the
suspicion&mdash;a suspicion which amounts to certainty with me. And I am
not a man to form hasty judgments. I will further remind you that
my Lord Pauncefort is a gamester, broken and desperate, and I do
not suggest, I state, and I will maintain my statement wherever and
whenever opportunity is afforded me&mdash;he has taken this dastardly
course to mend his shattered fortunes. In a word, gentlemen, he has
sold us; and I make no doubt that he has obtained a handsome price
from the Secretary of State for his Judas services."</p>
<p>Harewood got angrily to his feet. "By God!" he swore. "I'll not
hear a man thus abused in his absence!"</p>
<p>"You shall not find me slow to accuse him to his face," said the
Captain. "The opportunity of that, I think, is all that I can now
ask of Fortune."</p>
<p>Harewood looked round with glaring eyes, in appeal to the others
to repudiate this hideous charge against his friend; but on every
face he saw conviction written. The thing was all too plain. The
viscount felt that conviction being borne in upon his very self,
yet loyally he sought to hold it off.</p>
<p>"I'll not believe it! Sink me, I'll not believe it!" he
exclaimed, although his voice almost broke on the words.</p>
<p>"The decision," said the Captain, "does your heart more credit
than your judgment. Yet, my lord, lest you or any here should think
that I judge rashly, let me add something that is known to
me&mdash;something that I confess has spurred me on to this conclusion."
And briefly he informed the company of the threat which Pauncefort
had uttered to Sir John Kynaston. "Now," he concluded, "I hold that
in such a matter there is no ground for thinking that the man who
is so lost to honour as to threaten will hesitate to perform."</p>
<p>Convinced, Harewood sat down and took his head in his hands. "He
was my friend," he said in a dull voice.</p>
<p>Smoking quietly, Captain Gaynor turned again to O'Neill. "You
have not said that there is a warrant out for me."</p>
<p>"I was coming to't," was the answer, and the Irishman's face
quickened with excitement. "There is and there is not."</p>
<p>"How?" Gaynor looked at him with knitting brows.</p>
<p>"There is a warrant issued for Captain Jenkyn," was the
explanation, "and it is expected that he will be taken here with
the rest of us."</p>
<p>The soldier stiffened visibly. Here was the last ounce of proof
against Pauncefort. For but two men in England knew of his identity
with the bearer of that sobriquet&mdash;his lordship and Sir John
Kynaston. Not even these gentlemen gathered here together had
hitherto suspected it. At the announcement now there was an outcry,
dominated by Leigh's outflung hand and thundered monosyllable&mdash;</p>
<p>"You!"</p>
<p>The Captain smiled at them, and slowly, deprecatingly, shook his
head.</p>
<p>"Sirs," he said, "you cannot really think that Captain Jenkyn is
any particular individual. Rather, I think, is it a title conferred
by the Government to fit any Jacobite agent who visits England. On
this occasion, from what O'Neill tells us, it would seem they
thrust the honour upon me. But," and he turned again to the
Irishman, "I am not specified by name in the warrant?"</p>
<p>"By no other name&mdash;no."</p>
<p>"That is very odd."</p>
<p>"Ay," returned O'Neill, "until we have the explanation, which is
still more odd, bedad. You were specifically accused to the
Secretary of State. But when he desired Mr Templeton to issue a
warrant in due form, Mr Templeton urged that there was some
mistake&mdash;that his lordship's informer was perforce in error; that
Captain Harry Gaynor was no Jacobite but a soldier of fortune whose
entire record and whose credentials were in his hands, a man who
had no sympathy with the Stuart Cause and who had been recommended
to him by his own cousin, Tollemache Templeton, an old friend of
your own.</p>
<p>"Lord Carteret, it seems, sought to combat Mr Templeton's
confidence; but the Second Secretary is an obstinate man who claims
that he is never at fault. He laid Captain Gaynor's credentials
before Lord Carteret, and when his lordship suggested that such
documents could be forged, Mr Templeton took coach and visited the
embassies of two of the governments from which certain of those
credentials proceeded."</p>
<p>"What embassies?" quoth the Captain, his eyes preternaturally
bright.</p>
<p>"The Austrian and the Turkish."</p>
<p>The Captain sighed his instant relief from that sudden tension.
He even smiled as the Irishman continued: "Mr Templeton was assured
at both that the documents presented were entirely genuine. The
Turkish ambassador, indeed, claimed a personal acquaintance with
Captain Gaynor made in Constantinople four years ago, and spoke, I
am informed, in terms of high praise of you to the Second
Secretary. With this information Mr Templeton returned to Lord
Carteret, and boldly informed his lordship that he would resign his
office ere he made himself the laughing-stock of the town by
issuing a warrant against a gentleman so unimpeachable and
accredited. This, sir, in my cousin's own presence. My Lord
Carteret was swayed by that assurance; he bowed before it to the
extent of consenting that the warrant should be made out for
'Captain Jenkyn'&mdash;whose identity, he was informed, was one with
your own. To this Mr Templeton made no objection, confident that
the result must prove the correctness of his own and the error of
his lordship's information."</p>
<p>"It is a confidence," said the Captain, smiling, "in which we
must see to't that Mr Templeton is encouraged." It gratified him to
observe the good fruit borne by the thoroughness of his
dispositions, and he was thankful for it in this extremity.</p>
<p>"And how is that to be accomplished now?" quoth Mr Dyke from the
other end of the table.</p>
<p>The Captain smoked in silence an instant. Then he removed the
pipe from his lips, and spoke.</p>
<p>"Let us for a moment consider our position. I do not think that
it is one that need cause us any undue alarm."</p>
<p>"Do you not, by God!" growled old Sir Thomas. "Then, you're
monstrous slow at taking alarm, sir."</p>
<p>"When you have heard me perhaps you will abate your own," the
soldier answered him, and with that proceeded: "If, gentlemen, you
have been properly cautious, you should not now stand in any grave
peril." He was thinking swiftly, speaking almost as he thought.
"These arrests are premature. In a month's time they might have
occasioned concern. As it is, what can be proved against any man of
you?</p>
<p>"Return then quietly to your homes, and pursue your avocations.
Should you be arrested, suffer it in patience, and in the
conviction that your liberty must very speedily be restored to you.
It would not surprise me," he continued, "if this prematureness
were deliberate. It is Lord Carteret's policy to stifle our work at
its very source, and to strike terror into our leaders by a display
of the Government's omniscience rather than allow any treason to
spread to punishable lengths. It is devilish shrewd of him, for he
knows that martyrs to a cause beget sympathy for that cause, and
ten emulators for every one that falls. Therefore, he does not
desire martyrs. Should you be arrested the matter will probably end
in a private admonition from Lord Carteret to each of you ere you
are restored to liberty. That, sirs, I think, is the position."</p>
<p>His calm, so admirably dissembling his own inward despair&mdash;fell
like a balm upon those five disordered minds.</p>
<p>But Sir Thomas Leigh found an objection to his reasoning.</p>
<p>"You do not overlook, I trust, that our betrayal proceeds from
within?"</p>
<p>"I do not, Sir Thomas. But it would be unreasonable to suppose
that our ranks have yielded more than one traitor, and the word of
one man alone&mdash;actuated, no doubt, from motives of
self-interest&mdash;whilst serving the ends of Lord Carteret to damp us
with terror of his omniscience, as I have said, is very far from
sufficing to produce the conviction of any who does not betray
himself.</p>
<p>"You are further to remember that it is in the last degree
unlikely that our betrayer will come forward to accuse us. That,
indeed, would be a foolish procedure on every count. Pauncefort
must have made it a condition of his bargain with the Government
that he shall remain in the background, and the Government itself
must have desired this, for once the informer were proclaimed his
value would be at an end&mdash;and a man in Pauncefort's position is of
very great value, so great that the Government may well desire to
retain his services for the future&mdash;that is, assuming that
Pauncefort is to live. But I think we owe it to ourselves in this
case to make assurance doubly sure."</p>
<p>His voice rang with so sinister a note that all eyes were turned
to search his countenance. It was hard now to the point of
cruelty.</p>
<p>"It should, I think, be a point of expediency and honour with
any who is so fortunate as to escape the trap laid for us here
tonight to seek out my Lord Pauncefort, and&mdash;" A swift, trenchant
gesture with the pipe-stem completed his meaning.</p>
<p>There was a gasp from Mr Partridge; dismay was written, too,
upon the face of Harewood.</p>
<p>"We are not children, sirs," said the Captain in a rasping
voice, "and our game is not a child's game. When a man betrays us
we have a duty to discharge to ourselves, to one another and to the
Cause we serve. For a traitor there is but one punishment all the
world over. That punishment Lord Pauncefort has incurred, and I,
for one, pray heaven that I may be spared long enough from the
clutches of the law to administer it myself. So would I have each
of you think."</p>
<p>The white hawk-face of Mr Dyke looked singularly vicious as he
swore what he would do, given the opportunity, and he was followed
instantly by O'Neill and old Sir Thomas.</p>
<p>"One risk, however, we do run, sirs, in spite of what I have
said," the Captain resumed, "and it is somewhat serious&mdash;the risk
of my being taken in your company. If I am so taken the identity of
Captain Jenkyn is established and attached to Harry Gaynor, and Mr
Templeton is proven wrong in his assurance. Whatever happen to the
rest, for Captain Jenkyn there will be no mercy; he will receive
the very shortest shrift.</p>
<p>"If, then, I am taken in your company, I am destroyed by being
found with you, as was promised by our betrayer; and similarly you
may suffer grievously for being found with me. Our chief danger,
then, lies there. If you are taken without me, your danger is
reduced to insignificant proportions, as I have said. If I am taken
anywhere but here, my own risk also is lessened to
vanishing-point."</p>
<p>Their agreement with this reasoning was immediate and
unanimous.</p>
<p>"And therefore," added Mr Dyke, "it is of the first importance
that we should be rid of you and you of us."</p>
<p>"Precisely," the Captain agreed. "All that remains to be
determined is how we shall achieve that most desirable
consummation; and the means, I confess, do not seem quite ready to
our hands. Can any of you propose a course?"</p>
<p>"Where the devil is that rascal Maclean?" roared Sir Thomas.</p>
<p>"'Tis what I've been wonderin' myself," said O'Neill, "for
savin' the brandy I've filched from you, Sir Thomas, 'tis devil a
thought has been bestowed upon my thirst."</p>
<p>"Is there no safe way of calling him?" quoth Partridge.</p>
<p>"No way that is not fraught with danger in a house that is
watched," said the thoughtful Mr Dyke. "If he has left us alone
'tis a sign he is convinced we are besieged and fears to come to us
lest he should show the way to others."</p>
<p>And then, at last, the door opened, and Maclean himself came in.
He was rather breathless, and his broad face had lost much of its
habitual florid tint.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>Chapter 9. THE ALIBI</h2>
<p>Twice before had Maclean attempted to repair to the
conspirators, but each time prudence had compelled him to abandon
the attempt. On the first occasion he was crossing the outer room
when he heard the door open softly behind him, and, looking over
his shoulder, found himself observed by the spy.</p>
<p>He betrayed no uneasiness, but affecting to continue on his way,
reached the overmantel and took thence a couple of candle branches,
with which he returned.</p>
<p>The face of the Bow Street messenger betrayed the extent to
which he was intrigued. He had been on the watch, and observing
Maclean's cautious approach he had inferred from it that at last he
was to be put upon the trail of his quarry. Instead he found the
landlord seeking a pair of candle branches in an empty room. The
spy felt naturally aggrieved.</p>
<p>"D'ye lack aught, sir?" Maclean had asked him, between
landlordly solicitude and challenge.</p>
<p>"I do," replied the spy, practically at bay. "I am seeking some
friends o' mine who are expecting me here. One is Sir Thomas Leigh;
belike you'll be acquainted with him?"</p>
<p>Maclean's expression was that of one who innocently searches in
his memory. He shook his head. "Not by name," said he slowly. "Have
ye looked in the room yonder?" And he indicated the room across the
passage to which he had earlier directed the spy.</p>
<p>"I have. And he's not there."</p>
<p>"Perhaps he'll be below stairs, then."</p>
<p>"Neither is he below stairs." The messenger's tone was grim; his
eyes intently watched the landlord's baffling face.</p>
<p>"Then, sir, I'm afraid he'll not be here."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said the spy. "Very odd! Ve-ry odd!"</p>
<p>But the face of the dour Scot remained politely blank. Clearly,
the spy considered, there was naught to be made of this fellow, and
to push insistence further just then might be to give an alarm that
must result in the flight of his game.</p>
<p>"I'll wait," he added shortly, and, turning, made his way back
to the room which he had lately quitted. But he did not enter it.
Maclean had bowed and passed on down the stairs. The spy stood
watching him with a certain hope. This, however, was frustrated. He
was completely baffled by the circumstance that never once did
Maclean so much as turn his head. Such indifference argued a quiet
conscience. Was it possible, he wondered, that Maclean might be in
ignorance of the meeting that was taking placed under his roof? The
fellow's obvious unconcern scarcely admitted of any other
conclusion.</p>
<p>He wandered down the passage, listening outside doors as he
went, but gaining no useful information until he came to the end,
where he found a door ajar. He gently pushed it, and made the
discovery that it opened upon a narrow staircase. He peered down
and ascertained that this led to the kitchen and to the garden at
the back of the inn. He realised to his dismay that this back
staircase formed an emergency exit of whose existence he had been
in ignorance. Was it possible that while he had been wasting his
time in that room on the right, the landlord, smoking his business,
had got the plotters away?</p>
<p>He turned and came thoughtfully back. And now he perceived the
host coming upstairs again. Straight towards him came Maclean.</p>
<p>"Is your friend a tall, elderly gentleman with a red face?" he
asked.</p>
<p>"Ay," said the spy. "He answers that description."</p>
<p>"Then he is in the taproom below there."</p>
<p>The spy thanked him, and descended, leaving the host upon the
landing. But it is not to be supposed that the fellow was imposed
upon. He simply availed himself of this petard of Maclean's to
hoist Maclean himself. He turned into the taproom. But the next
instant he had thrust out his head to see what course Maclean was
taking, and he was just in time to see the landlord again vanish
into that room on the left where earlier he had surprised him.</p>
<p>The messenger flung out of the house at once to his men who sat
sipping their ale at one of the trestle tables. He was a shrewd,
calculating fellow, and he made not the slightest doubt about what
must follow. He took his six bullies round to the pleasant garden
at the back, and bestowed them and himself very carefully behind a
hedge of laurel, the gathering dusk assisting his manoeuvre.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Maclean had, at last, penetrated to the inner chamber
where the conspirators were gathered, and had announced to them
that beyond all doubt the Bow Street messenger was seeking
themselves, having gone the length of asking for Sir Thomas Leigh
by name.</p>
<p>"There's a pack of ruffianly fellows outside, and it's not a
doubt but they will be his followers. Ye must take t'other way&mdash;by
the back; and now is your opportunity, whilst the spy is gone on a
fool's errand for me."</p>
<p>They were on their feet at once, ready and anxious to be
gone.</p>
<p>"Your horses are ready for you in the stables, and my lad awaits
you there. Come, sirs."</p>
<p>They moved at once, but Captain Gaynor detained them yet a
moment.</p>
<p>"We part here," he said. "I will wait until you are safely away.
If I succeed afterwards in making my own escape, I shall be found
at 'White's' at noon tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Will you not go first, Captain?" suggested Mr Partridge.</p>
<p>"No, no," he answered. "I have something yet to do ere I can run
the risk of capture. Away with you, then, and good luck go with
you."</p>
<p>When they had departed, Captain Gaynor took a taper from the
overmantel, lighted it and reduced to ashes certain papers which he
carried between the leathers of his sword-belt. He sighed over the
act, for it marked the end of the business upon which he was come.
Since that was discovered there was an end for the present to the
need of such papers, and since his own arrest perhaps impended,
their destruction was imperative.</p>
<p>Leaving a little heap of ashes in the grate, he quitted the
chamber in his turn, went swiftly across the outer room, and,
having assured himself with due precaution that the coast was
clear, he stepped out into the corridor, and made his way to the
door at the head of the back staircase.</p>
<p>He reached it without encountering anyone, and having pushed it
open he was on the point of descending when a sudden uproar below
brought him sharply to a halt. Above the din of voices rang the
call: "In the King's name! Surrender! In the King's name!" Lastly
came a cry of: "Hold there, or I fire!"</p>
<p>Gaynor rapped out an oath. His friends, it was plain, had walked
into a trap. The house, he concluded, was surrounded, or, at least,
both back and front were being watched. He was thankful for the
others' sake as much as for his own that he had not accompanied
them. He caught the sound of a scuffle; a pistol-shot cracked
suddenly and was followed by a cry: Then the din gradually
receded.</p>
<p>But there was now commotion within doors, for the inmates of the
house had been disturbed by these sounds of battle. He heard steps
and voices in the corridor behind him, and he was grateful to the
gloom that gave him cover. He must not be found there; that was of
the first importance now, and it would be more than probable that
there were other tipstaves in the approaching company.</p>
<p>There was a door on the captain's right. Unhesitatingly he
turned the handle. It yielded. He slipped in, closed the door
softly and turned the key, which he was thankful to find on the
inside. Then he faced about to make the discovery that he was in a
bedroom. It was untenanted at the moment but there was no lack of
evidence that it possessed a tenant.</p>
<p>A cloak was thrown over the back of a chair, and under it stood
a pair of feminine shoes with high French heels. On the bed lay a
petticoat and a wrap. A valise gaped on the floor, its contents
bulging, and among these the Captain noted a prodigious display of
laces and ribbons.</p>
<p>Through the window, facing eastwards towards London, he had a
glimpse of trees and fields and hedgerows, backed by the fine grey
pile of Beaufort House, all very soft and mellow in the evening
light.</p>
<p>And then, from a curtained alcove hitherto unperceived by him,
came a clear, young voice to freeze him where he stood by its
unexpectedness.</p>
<p>"Is that you at last, Henry?"</p>
<p>His recovery was instantaneous. Reflecting that Henry was indeed
his name, he had no hesitation in answering the question with the
shortest affirmative in the language.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Where have you tarried so long?" came the voice again, and it
contained a note of petulance. "You knew that I stayed for you. And
I am hungry, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>Quite suddenly she appeared between the parted curtains, her
speech cropped short at sight of him. It had been his dread lest
she should be in an incomplete condition of toilet, in which case
he thought that outraged modesty combined with alarm would most
surely set her screaming. To his relief, however, she appeared
before him fully dressed, save for a slight and very charming
disorder of her hair and the absence of tucker from her alabaster
neck.</p>
<p>She was a handsome, regal woman, and she made a very engaging
picture standing there between the parted curtains of red velvet.
But it was a picture which, however delightful in itself, delighted
Captain Gaynor not at all. Before she could give expression to the
alarm that stared in her eyes and blenching face, the Captain bowed
low and most reassuringly.</p>
<p>"Most profoundly do I crave your indulgence for my error,
ma'am," said he.</p>
<p>His voice was so serene and courteous, his air and manner so
much that of the fine gentleman that her fears sank down a little;
but not quite.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" she demanded, her voice vibrating. "What do you
here?"</p>
<p>"I am just a blunderer who has strayed into the wrong room," he
explained.</p>
<p>"You have locked the door," she accused him, and her alarm
appeared to rise once more.</p>
<p>"'Twas that I desired to be alone," he answered.</p>
<p>"You"&mdash;her voice was growing shrill&mdash;"you answered to the name
of Henry," she remembered.</p>
<p>"My name is Henry, ma'am," he assured her.</p>
<p>There fell a pause. She stood with knitted brows and quickened
bosom, waiting. At last&mdash;"Why do you stay, then?" she challenged
him, and as she spoke she came forward towards where the bell-rope
hung.</p>
<p>"I but await your leave to go," he answered her.</p>
<p>"My leave?" said she, pausing in her amazement. "Depart at once,
sir."</p>
<p>"At once, ma'am," said he submissively. But on the words,
greatly to her alarm, he advanced resolutely into the room. "By
your leave," said he quite coolly, "I should prefer to go by the
window."</p>
<p>"By the window?" she echoed, and began to wonder was he mad.
Along the passage outside the door sped hurrying feet; a murmur of
voices reached them through the panels.</p>
<p>"You hear, madam," he said, waving a hand in that direction. "I
hope I am not so utterly lost to consideration for the fair name of
a lady as to permit myself to be seen issuing from her chamber. You
will agree, I am sure, that the window is most opportune."</p>
<p>She eyed him narrowly, barring now his way. And he admired her
spirit as much as the ripe beauty of her.</p>
<p>"Do you know who I am, sir?" she asked. "I am Lady Tresh. My
husband is Sir Henry Tresh, one of the Middlesex justices."</p>
<p>"Sir Henry is a man to be envied, ma'am," said he, no whit
abashed. Indeed, the situation was becoming humorous. He made her a
leg, his hat upon his heart. "I should have preferred, ma'am, that
we had met under circumstances more auspicious to myself. But even
so, I am honoured&mdash;profoundly honoured." And he bowed again. He was
in no haste to depart either by door or window. Indeed, the longer
he delayed, the better would it suit him. Already, he observed, the
sounds in the corridor were receding.</p>
<p>"Unlock that door, sir," she commanded, standing before him like
a queen of tragedy, with one arm out-flung to emphasise her stem
command.</p>
<p>"It were so unwise," he deprecated. "And the window is so very
opportune. It cannot be more than a dozen feet above the
ground."</p>
<p>Her queenly bosom heaved in agitation. "Will you tell me who you
are?" she demanded once more.</p>
<p>He shrugged, his eyes smiling ruefully. He was on the point of
answering truthfully, accounting that perhaps the best course might
be to cast himself upon her mercy, when suddenly he saw a fresh
alarm leap into her eyes and one hand fly to her bosom.</p>
<p>Down the corridor came a heavy, lumbering step&mdash;a step to which
she was listening and which was known to her. It paused at the
door, and the handle turned with a rattle. Then a double knock
rapped on the panel and a gruff voice called: "Kate!"</p>
<p>"My husband!" She no more than breathed the words.</p>
<p>The Captain spread his hands, and his face showed concern for
her. "You see," he whispered back, "that the window becomes more
opportune than ever."</p>
<p>She wrung her hands. Her eyes were upon him in a look that was
between distress and anger.</p>
<p>"I am undone!" she moaned.</p>
<p>"Nay, nay!" He tiptoed past her to the window, and flung it
open.</p>
<p>Raps more numerous, louder and more insistent came again upon
the panel. Again the handle of the door was rattled. "Kate!" that
gruff voice was yelling now.</p>
<p>"It is you, Henry?" she called back. The intruder was already
astride of the sill.</p>
<p>"Whom else were you expecting?" growled the voice. "Damme! Why
must women for ever be locking themselves in?"</p>
<p>She crossed the room leisurely, and fumbled an instant at the
key. Captain Gaynor had vanished.</p>
<p>He dropped from the window&mdash;a good fourteen feet to the
ground&mdash;and landed somewhat shaken. But he did not stay to consider
it. He found himself in the stable-yard, and he sped across it like
a hare, to find cover in the stable itself. He gained it before Sir
Henry had crossed the threshold of the room above. He found there
young Maclean in a state of considerable perturbation.</p>
<p>The young Scot muttered a short thanksgiving at sight of the
Captain.</p>
<p>"Your horse is ready," was his greeting. "Come, sir."</p>
<p>From him now Captain Gaynor learnt that his five friends had all
been taken. They were gone in hackney carriages to London with the
tipstaves. Sir Thomas Leigh had drawn his sword, and had been shot
through the arm in consequence. Mr Dyke, too, had attempted to
resist the messengers, and had received a broken crown. Maclean the
elder, his son assured the fugitive, need occasion the Captain no
concern; he would know how to answer any awkward questions he might
he asked.</p>
<p>Having heard all that the young man could tell him, the Captain
took his decision. He would leave his horse where it was until he
called for it again. In its place he desired to be supplied with a
post-horse.</p>
<p>The bitterness which had assailed Captain Gaynor when first he
had learnt of the shrewd blow with which the Government had
demolished for the present any Jacobite development was now
dispelled. It would return, no doubt, anon, and be the sharper
perhaps for this respite. But for the moment he rode in a spirit of
elation born of the adventure upon which he was now set.</p>
<p>He reached Charing Cross some time after nightfall, and having
surrendered his horse at the post-house, he disappeared to execute
the project in his mind.</p>
<p>A half-hour later he was leaning in the shadow of a tree near
Whitehall steps, observing with interest a watchman who, with
lanthorn and staff, was pacing the river-front not far from his
hutch. Captain Gaynor produced from his breast-pocket a flask
containing close upon half-a-pint of brandy, which he had procured
at parting from young Maclean. He drank rather less than half,
poured the remainder into his waistcoat, and flung the flask into
the river. Then he reeled forth until he was level with the
watchman's box. Into this he hurtled, sat down and&mdash;apparently fell
fast asleep. At least he was discovered to be breathing
stertorously a minute later.</p>
<p>The watchman swore at him, prodded him with his staff, shook him
and bellowed in his ear, to all of which the Captain remained as
insensible as a stone image.</p>
<p>From these signs and from the overpowering fumes of brandy which
the fellow exhaled, the watchman came to the conclusion that he was
very drunk. Now there was an Act promulgated under the late queen
which accounted all drunkards to be disturbers of the peace, and
enjoined upon watchmen their apprehension and consignment to gaol.
If you were not drunk beyond all speech, you might for a shilling
or two obtain instead that the watchman should abandon his post to
escort you to your residence. But in such a case as the Captain's
there was but one course to pursue, and that course this member of
the law pursued.</p>
<p>He very carefully picked the Captain's pockets as a preliminary,
a proceeding which yielded him a profit so disproportionate with
the Captain's dress and appearance&mdash;the Captain having previously
bestowed his valuables beyond the reach of prying fingers&mdash;that the
old rascal was forced to conclude that those pockets had been
picked already. Then he whirled his rattle and brought up the
constable and a posse of other watchmen, besides a small crowd of
watermen from the riverside and several loiterers. Into the hands
of his brethren he delivered the inanimate body of the Captain,
informing the constable in a whisper of the state of the
gentleman's pockets, so as to save the constable the trouble of
going through them on his own account.</p>
<p>Thus Captain Gaynor was carried off to the Gatehouse at
Westminster, which was the nearest prison. There he was flung into
a dank, noisome chamber, tenanted already by some dozen of the very
foulest scourings of the streets. These would have gone over the
Captain's person for the sake of any pickings that the constable
and watchman might have left, but that the Captain, growing partly
sobered as the first filthy fingers touched him, roused himself
sufficiently to crash his fist into the face of their owner. The
fellow sank down with a howl that turned into an agonising cough.
His few remaining teeth had been loosened by the blow.</p>
<p>Thereafter the Captain was left in peace. For a man who could
smite such blows when too drunk to stand must be terrible indeed
when sober, and they might so have to reckon with him did they
abuse his present condition.</p>
<p>He reclined, then, against the wall with his legs stretched
straight before him; and thus he spent one of the most horrible
nights of his existence. But to comfort him he had the knowledge
that all had fallen out precisely as he had planned, and that there
remained but little doubt that its sequel in the morning would
fully compensate him for his present discomforts.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>Chapter 10. TWO LETTERS</h2>
<p>Mr Second Secretary Templeton sat at breakfast in the
dining-room of his stately mansion in Old Palace Yard. It was a
spacious, sunny chamber, panelled in white with an abundance of
gilding, and its long French windows stood open to the terrace,
over whose grey stone balustrade surged a riot of roses and
geraniums.</p>
<p>The statesman was at his ease in a bed-gown of blue brocade, his
cropped head swathed in a silk kerchief, whose rich colouring
exaggerated the sallowness of his long, aristocratic face. Facing
him across the round table sat Mrs Templeton, short, long-waisted
and inclining to stoutness. Like her husband, she was
dark-complexioned, and age had rendered masterful and rather too
aquiline a face that in youth had been accounted beautiful. Between
them sat the Second Secretary's cousin, Sir Richard Tollemache
Templeton, returned but yesterday from his foreign travels.</p>
<p>Although the baronet was quite ten years the statesman's
junior&mdash;Sir Richard cannot have been more than thirty at the
time&mdash;Mr Templeton, whose manner was patronising with all the
world, treated him with the deference due to the head of a family
into which he accounted it his greatest honour to have been born.
Family was a religion with Mr Templeton, and before the head of his
own he unbent to a most extraordinary degree; upon occasion he went
even the length of courting his approval and sympathy. He was
courting them this morning. He made philosophy for the purpose.</p>
<p>"In this world, my dear Tollemache," he was saying&mdash;he
considered "Richard" a form of address much too familiar to be used
towards one who occupied his cousin's exalted position&mdash;"in this
world the truly great but too seldom receive the recognition that
is their due. The vulgar&mdash;ah&mdash;undiscerning crowd will ever believe
what it is told. It has no judgment, no&mdash;ah&mdash;percipience of its
own. It considers great those who proclaim themselves great,
without reflecting that to true greatness such&mdash;ah&mdash;such a
proclamation must be in the last degree repugnant&mdash;in the last
degree repugnant."</p>
<p>"It is a repugnance undiscernible in your own case, Edward,"
said his lady, with a gleam almost of malice in her pale eyes.</p>
<p>"My dear&mdash;my love!" His mellow, sonorous voice quivered with
emphatic protest at such an implication. "Here in
the&mdash;ah&mdash;sacrosanct intimacy of my own domestic hearth, it may be
permitted me to&mdash;ah&mdash;denude myself."</p>
<p>"It will nevertheless be more becoming in you to retain your
gown," she snapped, in reproof of his too florid rhetoric, and Sir
Richard could not repress a smile.</p>
<p>"I do not speak of the body, madam, but of the soul&mdash;the mind,"
her husband boomed. "Surely, I say, at his own table, to his own
wife and to the head of his own family, in the presence of his
Lares and Penates, a man may speak with complete freedom, and
without the&mdash;ah&mdash;encumbrance of excessive modesty. Modesty is a
garment that every decent man must wear in public. But the public,
knowing naught of decency, account him truly great who goes without
it."</p>
<p>Thus he swung back to the subject from which his wife's
interruption had all but diverted him. "Now here is my Lord
Carteret, and here, Tollemache, am I. To Lord Carteret the rich
emoluments, the fawning sycophancy, the smile of majesty, the great
honours of his office as Secretary of State: to me&mdash;in comparative
obscurity&mdash;the labour that preserves him a fame which he himself
does naught to merit&mdash;naught to merit." And angrily he fell to
stirring his chocolate.</p>
<p>"But your own turn will come, Ned," said the amiable Sir
Richard. Mr Templeton paused in the stirring that he might level a
denunciatory spoon at his cousin. "And who will warrant me that?"
quoth he. He laughed almost angrily. "You do not apprehend, I see,
with what buttresses my lord props up his greatness. Let me
explain, Tollemache, let me explain.</p>
<p>"In affairs of State my Lord Carteret stands in the same
relation to me as the&mdash;ah&mdash;figure at the prow of a ship stands to
the&mdash;ah&mdash;navigator. No, no!" he reproved himself. "My metaphor is
too broad. Were it so, indeed, all would be well&mdash;all would be
well. But I have drawn you a false image."</p>
<p>"You would be more intelligible," said his wife, "if you
dispensed with images. What you mean is that it is you who steer
the ship of State, whilst my Lord Carteret takes the credit."</p>
<p>He nodded thoughtfully. He was impervious to the veiled sneer in
her words.</p>
<p>"You put it&mdash;ah&mdash;crudely, but truthfully&mdash;truthfully. But it
should be made clear to Tollemache that his lordship takes the
credit when there is credit to take. One of these fine days&mdash;mark
me!&mdash;one of these fine days, as a result of his unceasing
interferences with the&mdash;ah&mdash;navigator, the ship of State will run
aground. Do you think his lordship will take the blame of that as
he takes the credit of all smooth sailing? Do you think so?"</p>
<p>His eye roamed from Tollemache to his wife, and told them
plainly the opinion he should hold of their wit if they did think
so.</p>
<p>"No!" he boomed, having reached his climax.</p>
<p>"You are spilling your chocolate," said his wife.</p>
<p>"No!" he repeated, ignoring the frivolous interruption. "On that
day, at last, my lord will point out that he has a helmsman to
steer for him; he will protest that the shoal upon which we founder
was one of whose presence his helmsman should have been aware. Will
any blame him? Will majesty cease to smile upon him or sycophants
to fawn? No! The obloquy will fall where never fell the
credit&mdash;where never fell the credit. In short, upon myself" He sat
back in his chair, and stroked his massive chin. "That, Tollemache,
is the way reputations are made and reputations blasted."</p>
<p>He was almost in a towering passion.</p>
<p>"But," said Sir Richard soothingly, "so long as you are at the
helm, you can guard against any such disaster."</p>
<p>"Ah! There's the rub, Tollemache&mdash;there's the rub. I could, were
I left&mdash;ah&mdash;untrammelled; were I left to follow my own judgment;
did his lordship not perpetually interfere with me, and suggest
courses that are undesirable and sometimes perilous. Now take this
Jacobite business. You are a man of the world, Tollemache&mdash;head of
a great family, a soldier and a scholar." (Sir Richard dropped his
eyes before Mrs Templeton's stony stare.) "I ask you, Tollemache,
were you Secretary of State, would you, could you commit a blunder
so&mdash;ah&mdash;ineffable?"</p>
<p>"I think," said Sir Richard, not without some hesitation, "that
I can perceive the drift of Lord Carteret's policy."</p>
<p>Mr Templeton frowned; then his features relaxed into a smile.
"Drift!" he cried, and again, "drift! My dear Tollemache, I thank
you for teaching me that word. It is most excellent, most apposite.
It precisely describes his lordship's policy. It suggests
that&mdash;ah&mdash;driving before the gale of circumstance that is so
characteristic of his statesmanship. 'Drift' expresses it
completely&mdash;completely."</p>
<p>"Fiddlesticks!" said his wife. "Y'are a clever man, no doubt,
Edward, but you fall into the grave error of considering all other
men fools."</p>
<p>The statesman spread his hands. He apologised for her to his
cousin.</p>
<p>"Woman's logic, Tollemache!" quoth he, and cast an upward glance
at the ceiling. Then, to his wife: "My dear," he said, "do you not
perceive that the two propositions may not be reconciled. If I am a
clever man such an error is not possible to me."</p>
<p>"Then perhaps you are not a clever man," said she.</p>
<p>"That, my dear, represents a retraction inadmissible in
intelligent argument. You&mdash;ah&mdash;you merely interrupt, my love." He
was unusually bold.</p>
<p>"But is it not possible," suggested Sir Richard, his frank young
eyes upon his cousin, "that in stifling these Jacobite
smoulderings, in stamping them out before they can show a flame,
his lordship is discharging an easier task than that of quenching a
later possible conflagration?"</p>
<p>"You think so?" Mr Templeton was as sardonic as he dare be with
so august a person as the head of his family.</p>
<p>"I merely ask," said the baronet. "I am not a statesman."</p>
<p>"A loss to England, my dear Tollemache&mdash;a loss to England. But
you ask, and you shall be answered." He cleared his throat that he
might deliver himself without physical hindrance. "The contention
you make is his lordship's own. It is&mdash;ah&mdash;specious, but delusive.
If&mdash;if what you suggest were possible, the course would be an
excellent one; but it is not possible. The thing has no legal
sanction&mdash;it is almost illegal, for it is premature. And this is
shown by the consequences. We arrest these men, but do we put them
upon their trial? Aha! We dare not. We have not the means.
The&mdash;ah&mdash;accusation emanates generally from a single informer. We
keep our captives in prison for a week or so, and then his lordship
has them severally brought before him, reads them a homily upon the
heinousness of disloyalty, the folly of Jacobitism, dwells upon the
narrowness of their escape, which he attributes to his Majesty's
clemency instead of to his own lack of elements for preparing an
impeachment. Is that a dignified course for a government to pursue?
I ask you, Tollemache."</p>
<p>"Perhaps not," ventured Tollemache. "But it serves its purpose.
It instils fear into these plotters, and turns them from their
plotting. Thus, as I perceive it, the peace of the realm is
preserved."</p>
<p>Mr Templeton sipped his chocolate, swallowing with it some of
his rising indignation and chagrin at the obtuseness of the head of
the family.</p>
<p>"You are not a statesman, my dear Tollemache, and there are,
therefore, excuses for your short-sightedness which cannot possibly
be urged for my Lord Carteret," he said presently. "So long as
fortune favours these&mdash;ah&mdash;operations; so long as&mdash;to use your own
most excellent image&mdash;we drift before a favourable breeze of
chance, all goes well. But one of these fine days, my lord will put
his hand upon an innocent man, and there will then be a blazing
scandal, indemnities will be claimed, heaven alone knows what may
follow; but I know that, whatever it is, 'twill be upon my own
head. Now, take this case of your friend Captain Gaynor&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That, of course, was a most foolish misapprehension,"
Tollemache admitted.</p>
<p>"You see&mdash;you see!" cried the Second Secretary, rubbing his long
hands. "Yet had it not been for me&mdash;had I not bethought me of your
own introduction, of your knowledge of this man's life; had I not
seen the&mdash;ah&mdash;preposterousness of such a charge; had I not been in
possession of his unimpeachable credentials and had I not exercised
the prudence of seeking their confirmation at two of the embassies
(ab uno disce omnes) Captain Gaynor had been under arrest by now as
a Jacobite agent."</p>
<p>"Preposterous!" said Sir Richard. "The man is a soldier of
fortune, first and last. I have it on his own word that he had
thought of taking service with the Pretender, but that the service
could not yield him enough to live upon, whilst as for future
guerdon he had no faith in the ultimate success of the Pretender's
cause."</p>
<p>"And yet," cried Templeton, "in spite of all that I could say,
his lordship persists in his assurance that the information he has
received is not to be doubted, and that Captain Gaynor and the
agent Captain Jenkyn are one and the same man. It is only as a
consequence of my insistence and as a result of the information
obtained from the Austrian and Turkish embassies that his lordship
consents that the warrant shall be made out for Captain Jenkyn
only, confident that he would be taken last night at 'The Worlds
End' with the other plotters, and that when taken he would be
discovered to be Captain Gaynor."</p>
<p>A footman entered and came to proffer Mr Templeton a letter
bearing an official seal. He took it abstractedly.</p>
<p>"An extraordinary error," said Sir Richard, smiling. "I would we
knew the source of it. I vow that Harry Gaynor will be vastly
diverted when I tell him&mdash;yes, and grateful to you, Ned, for a
judgment and perspicacity which have saved him this annoyance."</p>
<p>"Oh, but for obstinacy, commend me to his lordship&mdash;commend me
to him!" cried Mr Templeton. "When he learns that no Captain
Gaynor&mdash;no Captain Jenkyn in any form&mdash;was taken with the
plotters&mdash;if, indeed, they are plotters, which is yet to prove,
does he admit, think you, that there has been an error? Not he.
'The Captain must have escaped,' he says. 'These rogues have done
their work badly.' There is no arguing with such a man."</p>
<p>He had broken the seal of the letter whilst speaking. He scanned
now its contents, and as he did so his face was seen to empurple.
He struck the table with his clenched hand.</p>
<p>"Now sink me into&mdash;ahem! There is no answer, Jones. Say that I
will answer it myself, in person, later." The servant vanished.</p>
<p>"What is it, Edward?" asked Mrs Templeton, who had observed the
alteration in her husband's countenance.</p>
<p>"What is it?" he echoed. "It is&mdash;But listen for yourselves?
Egad! If I had required a proof of what I was saying this could not
have come more opportunely to my hands. Listen." And he began to
read:</p>
<blockquote>DEAR MR TEMPLETON,&mdash;Acting upon the opinions which you
know me to entertain, I despatched last night a messenger to Sir
John Kynaston's place in Surrey to ascertain whether Captain Gaynor
continued there. This messenger has just brought me the information
that Captain Gaynor left Chertsey in the afternoon of yesterday and
has not yet returned. I shall be obliged if you will take such
measures as may be necessary to ascertain not only Captain Gaynor's
present whereabouts, but also the particular business which brought
him yesterday from Chertsey. It is greatly my fear that as a result
of my having lent an ear to your assurance that this person is not
the Jacobite agent I am informed, he may slip through our hands and
escape the country. I shall be surprised, indeed, if he is not on
his way to the coast or even at sea by this time. Believe me to be
your obedient servant,<br>
<br>
CARTERET</blockquote>
<p>He flung the missive down with an oath. "Blister me!" he
bellowed, and he was by no means a man addicted to such expletives.
"He blames me already, you see. I have enabled a Jacobite agent to
win clear, and this is coldly stated with no more proof that
Captain Gaynor is a Jacobite spy than that I am. The man may not
leave Chertsey but it is a proof to his lordship that he's a
Jacobite and on his way to the coast if not at sea already. Here,
my dear Tollemache, you may observe for yourself the mind of one of
the world's great men&mdash;ah&mdash;dissected, as it were, for your
inspection. What do you think of it?"</p>
<p>Sir Richard was frowning. "I am certainly of opinion that my
lord Carteret is a man of very rash and hasty conclusions."</p>
<p>"How long, I ask you, Tollemache, how long do you suppose that
such men could keep their positions were it not for such as I who
do their work like moles underground where none perceives them?
Pah!" He flung himself back in profoundest disgust.</p>
<p>"Is it impossible that his lordship should be right for once?"
quoth Mrs Templeton.</p>
<p>The question was as a cold douche to her husband. He cringed
under it.</p>
<p>"Right?" he gurgled. He tossed his arms to heaven. "Is he ever
right?"</p>
<p>"He is certainly wrong in this case, I'll stake my life on't,"
said Sir Richard, carrying conviction to Mrs Templeton and
extinguishing her nascent doubts.</p>
<p>"Ay, and in every other case," pronounced the fuming Second
Secretary. "You may stake your life on that too&mdash;with confidence. I
told him yesterday that if he was entirely&mdash;ah&mdash;positive, he might
issue the warrant himself and take the consequences. Did he? Bah!
He answered me that that was my function. My function&mdash;to run all
risks and stand between ridicule and this man who takes all the
glory that is shed."</p>
<p>Sir Richard rose from the table. "The situation may be awkward
for my friend Gaynor," he said.</p>
<p>"You have to find him," Mrs Templeton reminded them.</p>
<p>The door opened, and again the footman appeared. Again he was
the bearer of a letter, and Mr Templeton frowned prodigiously upon
perceiving it.</p>
<p>"What now?" quoth he.</p>
<p>"A messenger, sir, from the Gatehouse, Westminster. He stays for
a reply."</p>
<p>"From the Gatehouse? What a plague have I to do with the
Gatehouse? Am I at the beck of every magistrate's clerk?" He
snatched up the letter peevishly, and cut the thread that bound it.
It bore no seal.</p>
<p>He spread the sheet, read, frowned, then dropped it from hands
that were suddenly limp. He bore those hands to his sides. He
seemed to breathe stertorously for a moment, then he exploded; and
never in the experience of living man had the solemn, decorous
Second Secretary been heard to laugh as he laughed then. Peal upon
peal of it reverberated to the ceiling. Gradually, at last, it
weakened to a splutter. Mrs Templeton, Sir Richard and the very
footman regarded him with eyes of increasing alarm. At last the
power of speech was restored to him.</p>
<p>"He&mdash;he's found!" he cackled weakly "Oh&mdash;oh! He's found! He's
not at sea&mdash;not even on his way to the coast. He's&mdash;he's&mdash;Oh, sink
me! Where do you think he is? Where do you think he has been all
night?"</p>
<p>"Where?" quoth Sir Richard, staring; but having no doubt
concerning the person to whom Mr Templeton was referring.</p>
<p>"Listen!" The statesman took up the letter. "It is from the
magistrate, Sir Henry Tresh." And once more he read to them:</p>
<blockquote>HONOURED SIR,&mdash;There is brought before me this morning
a gentleman who has spent the night in the Gatehouse, having been
found early last evening by the watch dead-drunk in the
neighbourhood of Whitehall Steps. He gives the name of Captain
Harry Gaynor, claims the honour of your acquaintance, and presumes
to say that you will speak for him. I venture to send you a note
which he himself has penned to you, to inform you of his
circumstances, and I shall be honoured by a word to guide me in
dealing with him.</blockquote>
<p>He paused to wipe his eyes, still faintly tittering at the
thought of Lord Carteret's discomfiture. Sir Richard, too, was
smiling, as was even Mrs Templeton.</p>
<p>"But listen further to what the rascal writes, himself. The rare
impudence of this rogue to desire a Secretary of State to go bail
for him! Listen:</p>
<blockquote>"DEAR MR TEMPLETON,&mdash;Such muddled memories as I retain
of what befell me yester evening at 'The Cock' in Fleet Street are
at your disposal when I have the honour of meeting you, for I judge
that you may require to know more of how I am come to such a pass
as this. What concerns me chiefly at present is the circumstance
that whilst I was in an unconscious condition some rogues cleaned
out my pockets of such monies as I had, my watch and seals, the
silver lace on my coat, and everything else of value. But for this
I should make shift not to disturb you upon so trifling a matter. I
shall be vastly your debtor if you will send a line to Sir Henry
Tresh, as warranty that I shall pay the fine imposed so soon as my
liberty is restored me. Your most obedient&mdash;</blockquote>
<p>"And that," cried the jubilant Second Secretary, "is the
Jacobite plotter, the agent who yester evening was conspiring in a
tavern, the desperate Captain Jenkyn!" His laughter swelled again,
and it was joined now by his cousin's.</p>
<p>"That should answer my Lord Carteret, egad!" cried Richard.</p>
<p>"It should. It shall&mdash;ecod! it shall. I'll send him these
letters forthwith, and then straight to the Gatehouse to release
this rogue of a plotter."</p>
<p>He pushed back his chair, and rose. He turned to the waiting
servant.</p>
<p>"Say to the messenger that I shall follow him in person to wait
upon Sir Henry so soon as I am dressed."</p>
<p>"By your leave, I'll go with you, Ned," said Sir Richard.</p>
<p>"So you shall." He strode briskly to the door in the wake of the
departing lackey. "Oh, 'slife!" he cried over his shoulder. He was
most flippantly profane that morning. "I'ld give a deal to see his
lordship's countenance when he receives this testimony of an
alibi&mdash;and such an alibi!"</p>
<p>He went out laughing, overjoyed at the discomfiture in store for
his superior, and loving Harry Gaynor as a son for having provided
him with so very apt and crushing an answer to that haughtily
couched imputation.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a>Chapter 11. PAUNCEFORT'S
MOVE</h2>
<p>Captain Gaynor, duly enlarged from durance by the good offices
of Mr Templeton, and looking somewhat jaded and hollow-eyed as a
result of his unpleasant night in the Gatehouse&mdash;an appearance
which lent colour to the debauch of which he claimed to be
victim&mdash;was an object of mirth and the butt of a deal of spurious
wit on the part of the very jubilant Second Secretary.</p>
<p>When this had somewhat spent itself, the Captain explained the
object of his visit to town.</p>
<p>"I was on my way to wait upon you, sir, when this befell me," he
announced unblushingly. "I am hoping that by now you may have found
some commission for me."</p>
<p>The statesman's face lengthened. In Lord Carteret's present mood
it would be worse than futile to approach him on such a subject.
But he refrained from saying so. He contented himself with
deploring that so far naught of a quality worthy of the Captain's
high attainments had offered itself; but he protested that it was a
matter he must not be thought to be neglecting, and soon he hoped
to have the good fortune of offering Captain Gaynor something that
he would consider acceptable. The Captain expressed his profound
indebtedness.</p>
<p>"Meanwhile," said he, "I am for Scotland. I have friends there
whom I desire to visit, whom I have not seen for years."</p>
<p>His destination, as a matter of fact, was Rome and his master's
Court, to report his failure. But to announce that he was returning
abroad at such a moment must call for explanation, might even
savour of flight, and were therefore imprudent in the extreme.</p>
<p>"You will keep me advised of your whereabouts?" said Mr
Templeton.</p>
<p>"I shall be roaming," was the answer. "So perhaps 'twill be
best, should you have letters for me, that you address to me at
Childe's&mdash;my bankers here, with whom I shall be in communication. I
shall report myself to you immediately on my return to town."</p>
<p>On that, with the compliments which the occasion called for,
they parted.</p>
<p>Mr Templeton hired a chair, and went to wait upon Lord Carteret,
whilst Gaynor and his friend Sir Richard sauntered off
together.</p>
<p>Upon the pretence of repairing the loss he had suffered by the
picking of his pockets yesternight, Captain Gaynor paid a visit to
Childe's, upon whom he had a letter of credit. He drew there a sum
sufficient for the journey that lay before him. Next, towards noon,
they looked in at "White's", and for an hour or so they lounged
there in amiable talk of the pleasant season they had spent in
Italy in each other's company, and of other matters.</p>
<p>At the end of that hour they parted, the Captain to return to
Chertsey and Sir Richard announcing that upon the morrow he was for
his seat in Devonshire, where he hoped that Harry would visit him
ere he left England for the post in the colonies that was to be
obtained him.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor detested the deception he was practising upon his
friend, detested having used him in his need. He would have liked
at parting to tell him the truth of matters, but he dared not for
his very life's sake.</p>
<p>He walked from "White's" to the post-house at Charing Cross and
thence rode post to "The World's End" at Chelsea, where he but
stayed for a word with Maclean and to recover his own horse.</p>
<p>Heavy-hearted, now that the adventure was at an end, with all
the burden of a sense of failure upon him, he rode on to Chertsey;
and heaviest of all was the knowledge that tomorrow he must look
his last upon that sweet lady he had met in the enchanted garden.
Never again, it seemed to him would he ride fancy-free, never again
find the cup of adventure all satisfying, never again be content to
wander and take pleasure in the wandering. All was changed. All was
very dark ahead in a world that but a little week ago had been so
full of sunshine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mr Templeton had gone to lay before Lord Carteret the
desired evidence of Captain Gaynor's whereabouts, together with
conclusive proofs of the error under which the Secretary of State
had laboured.</p>
<p>This he performed with an abundance of smirks, an occasional
chuckle and many a "Did I not tell your lordship how it was?"
Finally he withdrew in magnificent, dignified triumph, his
knowledge and perspicacity entirely vindicated, leaving his
superior not only discomfited but extremely raw at his
discomfiture. For to be guffawed over in such a manner by your
underling, and to be forced almost to admit that you have sneered
at warnings which an intelligent man would have heeded, is not to
be endured complacently by any. Least of all is it to be endured by
a Secretary of State when the chastening falls from such soft,
pompous hands as those of a Mr Templeton.</p>
<p>Lord Carteret, as is the wont of men in high office, looked
about for someone upon whom he might visit his ill-humour and to
whom he might impart some of his own rawness. To him in this
questing mood comes that morning my Lord Pauncefort, very
resplendent in black periwig and saffron-coloured coat.</p>
<p>"Good morning, my lord!" the statesman greeted him, in a tone
that implied that he wished the viscount anything but a good
morning. "I was about to send for you." Lord Carteret&mdash;a man of a
comfortable habit of body, with a hooked nose, a crafty mouth, and
small round eyes that were singularly penetrating and
level&mdash;scowled upon his visitor. "What cock-and-bull tale was this
ye brought me concerning one Captain Gaynor?"</p>
<p>"Cock-and-bull tale" echoed Pauncefort, taken aback by the
question and still more by the tone of it. He drew himself up to
the full of his magnificent height, and stared down haughtily upon
the Secretary of State. He was not accustomed to being addressed in
the manner that Lord Carteret employed this morning.</p>
<p>But he did not long maintain his stare or his haughty poise. The
thin lips of the minister wore a sneer and the round little eyes
flashed a contempt before which Lord Pauncefort was forced to lower
his own. A slight flush crept into his swarthy cheeks.</p>
<p>Men such as Lord Carteret may use men such as Lord Pauncefort;
but from the moment they so use them equality ceases between them
and is never again to be resumed. To Lord Carteret, the viscount
was just a vulgar spy, to be used with contempt, paid his dirty
wages and scorned as was his proper due. All this he showed in that
faintly sneering mouth and disdainful eyes. "Those were my words,"
he said steadily, and he repeated them. "Cock-and-bull tale. This
Captain Gaynor was not at Chelsea last evening, and it has been
made plain to me that it is impossible he should be Captain Jenkyn,
as you have said. It was made plain to me yesterday; but I
persisted under your assurances, and as a consequence I have
enabled that coxcomb Templeton to laugh at me this morning. Now his
Majesty's Government, my lord," he continued mercilessly, "is not
paying you for fictions, but for exact&mdash;for scrupulously
exact&mdash;information."</p>
<p>"And you have had it," answered Pauncefort in a dull voice.</p>
<p>The statesman rapped the table impatiently with his knuckles.
"In this case we have not."</p>
<p>"In this case more than in any other," Pauncefort insisted.
"What should it profit me to accuse an innocent man who can prove
his innocence as soon as he speaks?"</p>
<p>"Yet that precisely appears to be Captain Gaynor's case."</p>
<p>"Appears to be&mdash;ay. The fellow is slippery as Satan
himself."</p>
<p>Lord Carteret pooh-poohed the statement. He proceeded to relate
where and how Captain Gaynor had spent the night. Pauncefort
listened attentively.</p>
<p>"At what hour did the watch discover him?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"At nightfall, I am informed."</p>
<p>"That would be at about half-past nine. And at what time were
the arrests effected at Chelsea?"</p>
<p>"At something before nine. He can hardly have been in both
places within the time and drunk himself into a stupor in between.
Besides, why should he?"</p>
<p>"To set up an alibi, in case it should be necessary. Was he
drunk at all?"</p>
<p>Lord Carteret shrugged impatiently. "The watch affirm it: they
should know, and Templeton swears he still stinks of brandy."</p>
<p>"And yet, that he is Captain Jenkyn I know; and that he was at
Chelsea last night I'll make oath."</p>
<p>"Had he been taken with the others, the fact that he is an agent
of the Pretender would have been established, and we could have
dealt with him. As it is&mdash;why, as it is, I must believe that
Templeton is right and that he is&mdash;"</p>
<p>"He is Captain Jenkyn, my lord," Pauncefort insisted still.</p>
<p>"You are becoming plaguily monotonous, sir," snapped Carteret.
"If you would prove a little more and affirm a little less I should
be better pleased with you. Ye see, we can't hang the fellow on
your bare word. Indeed anybody's word would be almost better in the
ears of a court than that of an informer. You understand?"</p>
<p>That he understood his countenance showed. "My lord," he burst
out angrily, "you are putting an affront upon me!"</p>
<p>The minister surveyed him coolly. "I am calling things by the
names that belong to them," he answered icily. And my lord was
compelled to swallow that added insult&mdash;his very proper and
inevitable wage.</p>
<p>"I'll wish your lordship a good morning" he said stiffly. He
bowed curtly and gained the door. There, a thought striking him, he
turned. "You said, I think, that Sir Henry Tresh was the justice
before whom Captain Gaynor was brought at Westminster?"</p>
<p>"That is so," said his lordship. "Come to me again when your
information stands upon better foundations."</p>
<p>The viscount went out raging, and kicked a flunkey out of his
way to vent a little of the fumes with which he was swollen to
bursting-point.</p>
<p>He straightway sought the magistrate upon a pretence of being a
friend of Captain Gaynor's who had just received news of his
arrest. Sir Henry informed him that the Captain was already at
large, whereafter his lordship lingered in talk concerning the
erstwhile prisoner, and in the course of their entertainment Chance
favoured Pauncefort in a manner entirely unexpected. He learnt that
Sir Henry had been at "The World's End" at Chelsea last night when
the arrest of the plotters was being effected, and he learnt
something further, something which was imparted that evening to Sir
Richard Tollemache Templeton by his cousin.</p>
<p>"What, think you, is my Lord Carteret's present view of your
friend Gaynor?" inquired the Second Secretary.</p>
<p>"Does he hang there still?" quoth Sir Richard in surprise.</p>
<p>"'Tis an obsession with him&mdash;an obsession! Oh, 'tis incredible
that fatuity should go to such lengths&mdash;incredible! And the story
itself would be incredible to any but a man who is&mdash;ah&mdash;lost to all
sense of the ridiculous. Why, listen to't. It transpires that by an
odd chance Sir Henry Tresh was at 'The World's End' last night when
the arrests were made. He was sitting over his wine with a friend
when the stir took place. Having witnessed it he goes to his wife's
room, finds the door locked, and believes that he hears voices
within the room. He knocks; there is a delay, and finally the
cuckold is admitted. He demands an explanation of those sounds, of
the delay and of the extraordinary agitation in which he finds her.
Whereupon she tells him that a gentleman unknown to her entered her
room and locked the door, leaving thereafter by the window.</p>
<p>"Sir Henry&mdash;a most obliging husband, this&mdash;believes her
implicitly, assumes that like enough the fellow would be one of the
Jacobites who escaped the general arrest. Today my Lord Carteret
hears the story, and concludes&mdash;can you credit it?&mdash;that here, at
last, is the explanation of why Captain Jenkyn was not taken with
the others. If he were to pause there, I could credit him still
with an&mdash;ah&mdash;with a remnant of sanity. But straightway Captain
Jenkyn becomes Captain Gaynor again, in spite of the alibi, the
credentials and all else. What, I ask you, Tollemache, can you say
to such a man?"</p>
<p>"God help England, I think," answered Sir Richard. "And the
worst of it all is that he threatens to execute the warrant for
Captain Jenkyn upon Captain Gaynor."</p>
<p>"Is he quite mad?" asked Tollemache.</p>
<p>"Quite&mdash;oh, quite!" And Mr Templeton shook his great head.
"He'll be in Bedlam before the year is out. But I've washed my
hands of the affair. I have told him so. I have warned him. Let the
consequences of it&mdash;if indeed he goes so far&mdash;recoil upon his own
head. I shall take measures to protect mine. I shall publish it
broadcast that in this blunder at least I am not concerned, that
indeed I have done all in my power to avert it. Then, when his
lordship rightly becomes the&mdash;ah&mdash;laughing-stock of the country for
an alarmist who sees Jacobite agents in every shadow, then we shall
see&mdash;we shall see." And Mr Templeton washed his hands in the air,
his eyes glowing upon a vision of power that should be transferred
to his own more capable hands as a proper and fitting result of his
chief's disgrace and downfall.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>Chapter 12. NATURE
TRIUMPHANT</h2>
<p>On the morrow Captain Gaynor made his preparations for leaving
England.</p>
<p>He had learnt upon returning to Priory Close of the messenger
who had sought him there, and thus realised how narrow had been his
escape. For the present, however, he had obtained&mdash;thanks to Mr
Templeton and his own wit&mdash;a temporary respite, and that respite he
proposed to employ in giving my Lord Pauncefort his quietus. He
looked upon this as a sacred duty, and he could not account himself
at liberty to depart out of England until he had discharged it. His
intention, therefore, was to return to London, and that very day
seek out his lordship and, wherever he found him, force upon him a
quarrel demanding immediate adjustment. He reflected that the
affair would serve him well, and would leave Mr Templeton with an
obvious explanation of his subsequent flight from England. He
should be glad of that, for he had no reason to embroil the Second
Secretary, who had been so very good a friend to him.</p>
<p>He began that morning by desiring his valet, Fisher, to pack his
few belongings, and by informing Fisher that once London were
reached he would be obliged by circumstances to dispense with a
body servant. The valet, who in the week during which he had served
the Captain had found him not only a kind and considerate master,
but further had been drawn to him by that magnetism which the
Captain's strong personality irradiated, was so distressed as to
seek the reason of this.</p>
<p>"I am very sorry, sir," he said. "I hope your Honour has no
cause to be displeased with me. I have done my best, but there has
been little opportunity&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It isn't that," said the Captain. He laid a hand upon the
little man's shoulder, and looked kindly into his sharp face. "You
have done very well, and I am sorry to part with you. But&mdash;to take
you into my confidence, which you'll respect, I know&mdash;I have an
affair on my hands."</p>
<p>"Oh, sir!" the fellow cried, with quick understanding, and
Gaynor was moved by the look of concern that leapt into those keen
eyes.</p>
<p>"If it end one way, Fisher," the Captain continued, "I shall
require no more servants. If it end the other&mdash;as I am trustful it
will&mdash;I shall be put to it to fly the country, and I cannot take
you with me."</p>
<p>"But why not, sir?" cried the valet. "I've travelled aforetime.
I was in France and Italy with his Grace of Wharton when I had the
honour to serve him. I know foreign ways. I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I do not doubt it at all, my friend," the Captain interrupted
him. "But there are reasons why I cannot take you, reasons for
which you must not press."</p>
<p>"I shouldn't dream of such a liberty, sir."</p>
<p>"Then we must leave it there. I am sorry, Fisher, sorry to part
with you."</p>
<p>"And I am sorry, sir," said the little man with profound
sincerity</p>
<p>"Thank you, Fisher."</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>
<p>Then the Captain went downstairs. He was touched a little by the
valet's manner. It seemed to increase the burden that was upon him.
He was almost obsessed by a sense of imminent evil, born, no doubt,
of the impending farewell that he must make to one with whom he
must leave, it seemed, a part of himself&mdash;and that the better
part&mdash;when he rode away that day.</p>
<p>He was exercised, too, by the continued absence of Sir John
Kynaston. There was news that, Sir John's brother being now out of
all danger, the baronet would be returning on the morrow or the day
after. But Captain Gaynor dared not wait and the abruptness of his
departure demanded an explanation; more, the events which had
transpired in these last few days made it necessary to convey a
warning to the baronet. Yet how was he to accomplish it? Write, he
dared not; for letters are ever dangerous and liable to
miscarriage, and the things he had to say might, if written, come
to prove a deadly witness against Sir John. Thus he was driven to
the decision that he must entrust his messages by word of mouth to
Evelyn&mdash;by whom, of course, he meant Damaris.</p>
<p>He reflected that Sir John might prefer her to remain&mdash;like the
rest of the household&mdash;in ignorance of her father's slight
association with the Jacobite Cause; but he had no alternative. It
was a choosing of the lesser of two evils; and, after all, he had
perceived in this sweet lady such admirable qualities of head and
heart that he was comparatively easy in his mind at the thought of
confiding in her. Moreover, he would so put it as not to betray Sir
John even to her in any unnecessary degree. With this intent he
sought her now.</p>
<p>He was informed by a servant that Miss Kynaston was with her
ladyship in the latter's withdrawing-room. Thither he went, to
find, of course, Lady Kynaston and Evelyn. They accorded him a
pleasant, friendly welcome. He hesitated to ask for the lady whom
he sought, and he was spared the need, for through the window he
espied her walking in the garden.</p>
<p>Yet for all his haste to join her there, he must linger awhile
in a properly deliberate exchange of courtesies with his hostess.
She had been perusing The Daily Courant of yesterday when he
entered, and, presumably for lack of other matter, she alluded to
something she had read.</p>
<p>"Did you hear aught in town, sir, of these knavish Jacobites who
are again attempting to undermine the peace of the realm?" she
asked him, and in the main, she was quoting words that she had
read.</p>
<p>"I heard something, madam," he answered lightly.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said she. "You do not treat the matter with a proper
seriousness."</p>
<p>"Is it very serious, ma'am?" he asked her.</p>
<p>"Serious? Why, the notorious Captain Jenkyn is in England
again."</p>
<p>"Pooh! A rumour, no doubt."</p>
<p>"Nay, sir, no rumour&mdash;a report."</p>
<p>"'Tis all one, mother dear," said Evelyn from the window, where
she was standing. "I hope they will not take him," she added, and
paid that gallant unknown the tribute of a sigh.</p>
<p>"You hope they will not take him, Evelyn!" Her ladyship was
outraged by such a sentiment. "The man is a dangerous and
pernicious rebel. And they'll take him, never fear."</p>
<p>"I wonder!" said Captain Gaynor.</p>
<p>"Look at this," she bade him, and held out The Courant.</p>
<p>He took the news-sheet, and followed the indication of her
finger. But there was not the need of it. The bold announcement at
the foot of the second column challenged every eye:</p>
<blockquote>ADVERTISEMENT<br>
<br>
WHEREAS it is reported to his Majesty's Government that the
notorious rebel and Jacobite spy and agent who is known as Captain
Jenkyn is at this present time in England, his Majesty's Secretary
of State hereby gives notice that any who shall bring such
information as will lead to the arrest and conviction of the said
rebel shall receive from his Majesty's Treasury the sum of TWELVE
HUNDRED GUINEAS in REWARD.</blockquote>
<p>"His value is increasing, it seems," said the Captain, returning
the sheet to her ladyship. "Poor devil!" he added, and soon
afterwards found an excuse upon which he might withdraw and go to
join Damaris in the garden.</p>
<p>"Madam," he said, bowing formally before her, "I am
come&mdash;alas!&mdash;to take my leave of you. But ere I go there is
something I desire to say for your private ear, if you will so
honour me."</p>
<p>He saw the quick blood leap to her cheeks and ebb thence again,
leaving her very white; he saw that droop of the brown eyes, the
sudden agitation of her breast, the little quiver of her hand upon
the briar from which she had been about to break a rose.</p>
<p>He knew then how she misunderstood his aims; knew that she
cared; and the knowledge was as a sword in his flesh.</p>
<p>"Yes," she answered faintly. "I am listening, Captain
Gaynor."</p>
<p>He hesitated yet a moment. Then: "Will you walk, madam?" he
invited her, his voice oddly subdued, faltering a little even.</p>
<p>She turned at his bidding, and together they took their way at a
gentle pace towards the plantation; they crossed the bridge, and
followed the main valley of the glorious garden; and all this with
no word spoken between them, yet such a communion of soul and soul
as gladdened her and left him sick with fierce despair.</p>
<p>She imagined that she understood why he led her to the garden.
She remembered how he had spoken of it as enchanted, a place
wherein a man might be content to lay down ambition and have done
with strife. It was here, too, that they had first talked to any
purpose. It was almost as if they had met there, under the
apple-blossom, for until that talk they had been as utter
strangers. There it was that he had first revealed himself with all
that stark honesty which she found so admirable in him, that it
more than made amends for his avowed lack of great ideals. She was
touched by his desire that they should talk now in such a place;
that he should have chosen this garden of enchantment, in which he
had erst revealed himself, to reveal himself yet more fully unto
her alone.</p>
<p>Rejoicing, she went with him thither, as she would have gone
with him wheresoe'er he bade her. Was she not his to claim? And in
that hour she was glad indeed of the deception that had been
practised, glad that he had not known her for the heiress, Damaris
Hollinstone. For thus was she brought to the sweet and tranquil
conviction that here was one who desired her for her own self and
not for aught that she might have to give. She was glad, too, that
she was Damaris Hollinstone and rich, and glad that he was poor.
Thus should be increased the joy and blessing that would be hers in
giving&mdash;for she was of those selfless ones who, where they love,
desire to give and give. She knew that she was good to look upon;
and in this too she took joy that morning, since this too had she
to give.</p>
<p>She was dreaming as she stepped along beside him, a happy dream
whose fulfilment she deemed impending. Why did he not speak? she
wondered. Did he hesitate, poor lover? Did he doubt her? God wot,
there was but little need for that. Furtively, shyly she glanced
aside at him, to observe at last his haggard look and wrinkled
brow.</p>
<p>Dear heart! How needlessly was he torturing himself! How fondly
she longed for the uttered word that should give her the right to
drive forth his fears, to transfigure his face and smooth away
those lines. Yet she loved him the more for this most sweet
timidity towards her in one whom she judged of a nature that
normally was bold and fearless.</p>
<p>And then, at last, he spoke, his voice singularly small and
quiet; and his first words shattered that dream-paradise of hers so
abruptly that for an instant she was stunned and numb.</p>
<p>"It is of Sir John that I desire to speak to you, madam," he
said. "I have a message for him of gravest import&mdash;so grave that I
dare not write it, lest an ill-chance should put it into hands that
might use it against him."</p>
<p>Mechanically she walked on. She was choking. Her face was
deathly pale; her eyes seemed suddenly enlarged in it and very
dark; her mouth was trembling. But he observed naught of this. He
did not observe her at all. He was looking away through the
sundrenched orchard on their right.</p>
<p>Followed a little spell of silence, in which they came to the
first of those courts enclosed in their tall, boxwood settings. He
stood aside to let her pass first through the narrow archway in
that massive hedge. He followed, and they stood in the rose-garden,
which was now all fire and snow with petals red and white.</p>
<p>"You will tell him, madam, that I am grieved beyond all mention
that I may not stay another day for his return, to take my leave of
him in person; that I dare not; that with every hour I tarry now in
England the shadow of the gallows falls more heavily across my
path."</p>
<p>She came out of her stupor, awakened by the sinister image he
had employed.</p>
<p>"The gallows?" she cried, horror in every line of her lovely
face. "You are in danger!"</p>
<p>Deliberately had he spoken so, hoping that his words would
convey not only the intended message to Sir John, but a message to
her too that should explain his need to preserve silence upon the
subject on which she looked to hear from him. Yet now that he saw
and interpreted her alarm, his soul was torn with sobs unuttered.
His eyelids flickered. But beyond that he gave no sign of the
terrible ordeal he was sustaining, must sustain for honour's sake.
His every nerve and fibre shrieked imperatively that he should take
her in his arms, and claim her&mdash;who stood so ready for
surrender&mdash;for his own. But the calm, cold voice of Honour warned
him not to heed those treacherous behests of heedless Nature&mdash;of
Nature, who knows naught of honour and such human shibboleths.</p>
<p>What manner of knave would he be, Honour demanded, to return the
good that Sir John had ever done him by the evil of such a deed? To
repay the baronet's trust and affection by stealing away his only
child and bearing her with him upon his hapless wanderings?</p>
<p>Were Sir John here, things might be different. Captain Gaynor
could have gone to him and loyally spoken what was in his heart,
loyally abided by the baronet's decision. But without the baronet's
consent&mdash;a consent which Gaynor deemed extremely unlikely&mdash;he must
not speak to her of this thing with which his heart was bursting.
And linger until Sir John's return, he dared not; not merely for
the danger that he ran&mdash;that danger he would have faced most
gladly&mdash;but because his presence in England might place in jeopardy
those arrested Jacobites, against whom little could be enacted if
he remained undiscovered, he must depart at once. The voice of
Honour was very clear, and not to be misunderstood. It bade him be
silent, and so depart.</p>
<p>So in that swift flicker of his eyelids he determined. He
brushed aside with a disdainful gesture the suggestion that the
danger he ran was one to occasion concern.</p>
<p>"The danger is naught," he said, "or will be naught so that I
depart at once. And I mean not only danger to myself but danger to
others who would be implicated were I taken. Please remember this
that you may tell him. And that the principal ones of my master's
friends have been prematurely arrested; that no great harm
threatens them, but that for the present I have been obliged to
abandon my mission; that I shall not go to Rochester, nor indeed
take any further steps, but shall return immediately to Rome.</p>
<p>"That, I think, is all that I need say. The rest he will infer.
But add that there is a warrant out for my arrest&mdash;though not in my
own name, as the Government is not yet assured that my identity and
that of the person sought are one and the same. And before the
Government has such assurance&mdash;if indeed it ever has it&mdash;I hope to
be very far away. Bid him spare himself anxieties on my account. My
plans are soundly laid, and I have a friend at Court upon whose
offices I am depending.</p>
<p>"Tell him just that, madam," he concluded, his eyes ever
avoiding hers, "just that and my deep devotion. He will understand
why I was forced to this precipitate flight, and he will know how
to guard himself from any consequences of having sheltered me in
the event of my being ultimately identified with&mdash;with the man for
whom the warrant has been issued."</p>
<p>"I will remember all," she said&mdash;indeed, every word of it was
seared upon her memory&mdash;"and I will tell him. But you, sir"&mdash;her
voice dropped a little, and her tone by its gentleness seemed to
belie the words she uttered&mdash;"you have deceived me."</p>
<p>He looked up sharply. "Deceived you&mdash;I?"</p>
<p>"You represented yourself to me as an adventurer, a follower of
Fortune's banner, a mercenary who sold his sword to the highest
bidder."</p>
<p>"All this I have been&mdash;all this I am," he answered. "I practised
no deceit."</p>
<p>"You practise it still," she said, her pride in him increased a
thousandfold by her discovery. "You spoke but now of a mission and
of your master in Rome. You are a Jacobite, that much you have made
plain&mdash;one who in the pursuit of an ideal imperils his life and
moves, in your own words, under the shadow of the gallows. Yet,"
she reproached him almost fondly, so caressingly protesting was her
tone, "you represented yourself to me as a hireling; you provoked
and submitted to my scorn."</p>
<p>He trembled, looked at her, then looked away across the flaming
roses. His first impulse was to say that in this too he was a
mercenary; that what he did, he did for gold. First the falsehood
stayed him; then the reflection that even that falsehood could not
serve him now. He had won her love; her every word and look assured
him of it. Should he then be so ungenerous as to maintain this
hateful pretence that she was nothing to him? Could that serve any
but a hurtful purpose? Was it not better that he, too, should let
her see how it was with him? Was it not better that she should know
that where unwittingly he had conquered he had been conquered also?
That she should hold this knowledge would, he felt, comfort him;
and her too it might comfort. Some day&mdash;who knew?</p>
<p>But there he went too fast. He would convey it, but not utter
it. To utter it were to break down the barriers which Honour had
raised up.</p>
<p>"You are right," he said gently. "I crave your pardon."</p>
<p>"My pardon?" she echoed. "My pardon&mdash;for being noble where I
deemed you base!"</p>
<p>"Nay, for the deceit I put unworthily upon you."</p>
<p>"Why did you?" she asked him, the intimacy between them growing
now with an odd and alarming swiftness.</p>
<p>"To be consistent in the part I played. Had any known my secret,
all must know it. Yet there was no untruth in my deceit. I was a
mercenary in all other services but this. And of this I dared not
speak&mdash;at least not then."</p>
<p>"And now?" she asked him without shyness.</p>
<p>"Now?" He looked at her, full into her steadfast eyes that were
drawing his very soul from him. "Now to make amends I will place my
life in your gentle hands. God knows it is all I have to give." He
laughed a little ruefully. She was trembling. "I am he whom the
Government knows by the name of Captain Jenkyn."</p>
<p>She fell back with a little cry. She needed no explanation. She,
too, had seen The Daily Courant that morning and the Secretary of
State's announcement. She turned white to the lips, realising at
last to the full the overwhelming peril in which he stood. She
clasped her hands.</p>
<p>"Oh, God of pity!" was her moan. And then, in an agony:
"Why&mdash;oh, why did you tell me this?"</p>
<p>The appeal was more than he could endure. Impulse shattered
Honour's barriers at a blow, and struck Honour herself silent,
whilst Nature swept on triumphant and irresistible.</p>
<p>He strode to her, caught her in his arms and crushed her to him.
His voice shook with mingled pain and exultation.</p>
<p>"Because I love you, oh, my lady!" he cried. "Because all that I
have, all that I am I would place in your sweet hands in pledge of
it."</p>
<p>"I asked not any pledge," she sobbed in a gladness that mounted
and overrode her terror. His head drooped to her upturned face, and
they kissed. "Dear love," she murmured, as she lay there happily
upon his breast, "I, too, must make confession."</p>
<p>"Confess, dear sinner," he replied, "and be very sure of
shrift."</p>
<p>"I am glad that you deceived me, for I too have practised a
deceit on you."</p>
<p>"Deceit&mdash;thou?" his voice was scornful.</p>
<p>"I am not Evelyn," she confessed, watching his face, observing
the cloud that gathered on his brow. "I am Damaris
Hollinstone."</p>
<p>The cloud grew darker, then suddenly it vanished utterly and he
laughed.</p>
<p>"Faith, then, I'm glad," said he, "for Damaris is a sweeter and
more fitting name."</p>
<p>"And for no other reason?" she inquired.</p>
<p>"What other could there be? You are you under whatever name you
please."</p>
<p>And so they hung there, the world and all its perils sunk many a
fathom deep into oblivion, conscious of naught but each other&mdash;just
man and woman in a garden.</p>
<p>From behind the boxwood hedge stepped, soft-footed, a hidden
watcher. Another&mdash;a golden-headed, fragile slip of womanhood, fled,
shuddering and weeping softly in an agony of remorse at the
catastrophe she had invoked, a catastrophe that overleapt her every
expectation and spread grim tragedy where she had thought to set a
comedy with a spice of malice.</p>
<p>Through the archway into that Eden stepped the inevitable Satan,
wearing the handsome outward seeming of my Lord Pauncefort. He
paused an instant, himself unobserved, to consider the idyll that
he came to shatter with a bloody hand. And what time he paused, he
set upon his seething rage the mask of a sardonic humour.</p>
<p>"Soho!" he announced himself. "Here is not merely a rebel, but a
rebel in arms, it seems."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>Chapter 13. IN THE
ROSE-GARDEN</h2>
<p>Alarmed, confused, the lovers sprang apart; yet not so far apart
that the Captain's arm continued to encircle&mdash;protectingly now&mdash;the
waist of Damaris.</p>
<p>There followed a spell of silence during which the two men
measured each other with their eyes, like swordsmen about to
engage. And there was something more in the Captain's glance; there
was satisfaction to see before him the man who was become his
quarry. No need now to go afield in search of him. With a
smouldering eye, with something that was almost a smile on his lips
did Gaynor ponder now his enemy.</p>
<p>But it was Damaris, standing tense and white, who was the first
to break the silence.</p>
<p>"By what right, sir, do you thus insolently thrust yourself in
here?" she challenged the intruder.</p>
<p>"Do you, madam, question my right?" quoth he, eyebrows raised.
It was Captain Gaynor who supplied the answer to her question.</p>
<p>"By the right of his nature, Damaris. He can no more help being
a spy than the fox can help its smell."</p>
<p>His lordship's eyes swung back to the Captain's face, and
betrayed by their startled look how shrewdly this blow had caught
him. But he made a swift recovery, throwing back his handsome black
head in arrogance.</p>
<p>"What shall that mean, sir?"</p>
<p>"Mean, you base Judas!" The Captains passion was overmastering
him at the sight of this man whose falseness had wrought such
fearful havoc, had ruined for a season his beloved master's every
hope. Thus that fierce burst of rage escaped him. But he controlled
himself almost at once.</p>
<p>"Let me present to you, Damaris," said he, in a cold, sneering
voice, "the most infamous spy in England, who in the discharge of
that office has thrust himself here upon us. You may have conceived
that in my Lord Pauncefort you beheld a nobleman, a gentleman, a
man of honour. So have others thought to their undoing. Instead,
you behold there a broken gamester who for a handful of gold has
betrayed the men who trusted him and counted him their friend, has
sold the Cause in which he himself believed, has bartered his
honour and brought everlasting shame upon the name he bears."</p>
<p>"Be silent!" thundered Pauncefort, advancing a step and checking
there, his countenance writhing. "It is false, I say!"</p>
<p>"You perjured hound! False, is it? Ay, the deed was false and
foul as hell, in which it shall be expiated."</p>
<p>"Was it he betrayed you?" quoth Damaris, her voice most
singularly calm and quiet.</p>
<p>"Ay was it. Look on him, Damaris." He flung out an accusing arm.
"Look on him, for you may never again see such another&mdash;a man who
was born a gentleman and is reduced to infamy, a man who has pawned
his soul to keep his body in luxury."</p>
<p>Pauncefort was livid, stricken by the unexpectedness of this
attack, for he had been very far from dreaming that his treachery
was detected.</p>
<p>"And now, sir," said Damaris, "now that you have received what
was here your due, perhaps you will depart again?"</p>
<p>Her contempt struck him more keenly than the Captain's bitter
denunciation. It stirred him, awakened him from his stupor. Swiftly
he mastered himself to play his part in this game; and he was
suddenly heartened by the knowledge that he had a card in his pack
should trump this whirling Captain's trick.</p>
<p>He turned upon Gaynor very haughtily, every inch of him the
great gentleman.</p>
<p>"Sir," he said, "base as you are and as I know you to be, you
have said that to me here which is not to be borne by any man,
however high-placed, from another, however low. Elsewhere we will
continue this discussion."</p>
<p>"We shall, by God!" said Gaynor. "I so intend it."</p>
<p>"And," his lordship added, "you shall eat the lies you have
uttered." Upon that his gesture signified that he had done with
him. "But you, Damaris&mdash;oh, that you should have lent an ear to
this infamous defamer! that you should have believed these things
against me, myself unheard! This is what stings and cuts me to the
very soul!"</p>
<p>She surveyed him with an eye that pierced this miserable
artifice. She disdained him any answer other than: "Will you go
now, sir?"</p>
<p>He stared at her as if this fresh dismissal were beyond belief.
He played his part with vigour and intensity.</p>
<p>But it was quite futile. Yet in the face of his indifferent
audience he maintained it, enheartened by the confidence that his
finest line was yet to utter; saving this skilfully for his climax,
a climax that should overwhelm and conquer her for all her present
scorn of him.</p>
<p>"No," he answered, "I will not go. My place is here beside my
affianced wife."</p>
<p>"Your&mdash;?" She checked, her cheeks aflame. "You do well, I think,
to remind me of my shame. But that is past. I am your affianced
wife no longer."</p>
<p>"Ah?" he said. He was quite himself by now, betraying no least
sign of heat. "Since when this change?"</p>
<p>He got his answer pat. "Since you, yourself, failed in wit to
conceal from me that it was my fortune, not myself, you wooed."</p>
<p>He considered her, and his eyes were melancholy. He sighed. "I
feared you had thus misunderstood me!"</p>
<p>"Oh, I did not misunderstand you," she answered. "I understood
you for the first time. And that is how it happens that Captain
Gaynor's further revelation of your ways does not surprise me."</p>
<p>This was a blow between the eyes. But his lordship did not
stagger under it. He preserved a calm front. "For that, too," said
he "you shall contritely and of your own free will yet seek my
pardon."</p>
<p>"I?" Her contempt withered him. "Oh, will you go!"</p>
<p>And seeing him still making no shift to depart: "I think," said
the Captain, "this lady bids you go. Must I compel you to obey
her?"</p>
<p>"Very well," he said to Damaris, entirely ignoring the Captain.
"Very well." He bowed to her. "Another season will perhaps serve me
better. I should indeed prefer to clear myself in your eyes when
there are no witnesses at hand. Yet ere I go, I will ask you to
remember that however you may have misunderstood my motives, you
are pledged to me, and I have not redeemed you from that
pledge."</p>
<p>"Myself have cancelled it," she answered him. "I will not wed a
thief."</p>
<p>"Ha!" cried the Captain. "'Tis the very word&mdash;the very word I
sought. A thief! Ha!"</p>
<p>The swarthy face flushed heavily, the eyes were venomous in the
glance they flashed upon the Captain. My lord drew a deep breath
with a little hissing sound, thereby acknowledging the hit.</p>
<p>"How wanton can a woman be when her mood is cruel!" he
exclaimed. "How wanton is her injustice! This injustice; madam," he
continued sadly, his head bowed, "yourself shall come to
acknowledge. As I know you to be a true and generous woman where
you are not misled, so do I know that you will sue for pardon to
me. You think to fling me aside because you imagine&mdash;oh, so
mistakenly, dear God!&mdash;that I was a fortune hunter, that (in your
own cruel words) I wooed your fortune and not yourself. And
yet&mdash;and yet, such is a woman's blindness&mdash;you replace me by one
who is an avowed adventurer, a self-confessed fortune-hunter, a
mercenary in all things; one who openly and without disguise or
shame sought to win you for what you're like to bring him in
worldly estate."</p>
<p>He had begun at last to play his trumps, and Captain Gaynor
stiffened as he listened, stiffened in sudden horror of a picture
that leapt before the eyes of his memory.</p>
<p>"Have you quite done?" was all Damaris' acknowledgment of his
lordship's scathing words.</p>
<p>"Quite, if you do not believe me," he answered with grim
confidence.</p>
<p>Had she but preserved silence, had she but maintained her
haughty indifference, all might yet have been well. There would
have been no more to say, and, his rebuff complete, he must have
taken his departure. But, woman-like, she must have the last word
in this; she must come down a little from those frosty heights to
utter it, and in uttering it must open the door to more.</p>
<p>"I do not believe you," she said, to which he returned the
obvious answer:</p>
<p>"And if I could prove it to you?"</p>
<p>"Prove it?" she cried, and now her pride and confidence in her
lover were as much to blame as any other sentiments. "Prove it? You
poor deceiver! Why, I can prove the very contrary. Until this hour,
until he knew that he had won me&mdash;for I am his, my lord&mdash;he did not
know my name; he deemed me Evelyn Kynaston, as a result of a poor
deceit we put upon him; and for that I thank heaven, since it gives
me this easy means of showing how fully I account you what Captain
Gaynor says you are."</p>
<p>But his lordship brushed the insult aside. It was insignificant,
then; a mere piece of detail. The fact to which it was attached
arrested him. For a second it checkmated him. And then he saw how
it might be turned to account.</p>
<p>"He thought you Miss Kynaston?" he cried. "He has succeeded in
making you credit even that? Now what a most complete and finished
liar have we here!" Then, in a voice of thunder, a voice whose very
weight and volume seemed to increase the burden of his overpowering
words, he let her have it.</p>
<p>"Why, this man"&mdash;and he shook a quivering finger at the
Captain&mdash;"this dastard came here of set intent to woo you, ere ever
he had seen you. In his own words, ma'am, he knew not whether you
were tall or short, dark or fair, plump or lean, neither did he
care; he knew you for the wealthiest heiress in all England, and in
no other way did he desire to know you." He swung upon the Captain,
smiling grimly. "You see that I have treasured the remembrance of
your every word, sir."</p>
<p>"You hound! You jackal!" said the Captain through his teeth.</p>
<p>But my lord ran on: "And because he knew me betrothed to you;
because he knew me in straits for money, in the clutches of a
merciless usurer, a debtor's goal awaiting me, he availed himself
of my despair to propose to me that I should play him for the right
to wed you, which was mine. To my undying shame, I confess that I
succumbed. He set you against ten thousand guineas, and he lost.
Yet in spite of that, so false a dastard is he, he cannot abide by
that issue of the cards, but comes here to steal a thing which is
doubly lost to him in honour. And yet you call me a thief, and
fling yourself into the arms of such a thief as that!"</p>
<p>He paused, and still she answered nothing. Her calm was
impregnable. She just looked at him with eyes of coldest scorn,
eyes that seemed to say she but suffered him to talk that he might
be done the sooner, that she but waited to be rid of his unwelcome
presence. Yet he had not quite done. The card was played; but its
force and value were not yet realised.</p>
<p>"I have been in a very hell of shame since I lent
myself&mdash;induced in my despair&mdash;to such a thing. But however
shameful you may deem me, I am not shameful as is he. I at least
desired you because first and last I loved you. It was not your
fortune that I staked upon the board when I gambled for my right to
wed you&mdash;not your fortune, but my very life, my every hope. But
he&mdash;Well! I have told you what words he uttered. He will not deny
them if you ask him. He cannot, bold liar though he is."</p>
<p>He had finished. If he had ruined himself, at least he had
ruined the Captain. And yet for himself he had a glimmer of hope.
If on the recoil from himself she had tumbled into the Captain's
mercenary arms, might he not win her yet upon this second recoil
that must inevitably follow now? It was just possible, and he had
the means, he thought, to compel Sir John's assistance. He could
not think that he had talked in vain. He preened himself upon his
knowledge of the ways of women, and here he was confident of having
taken a course that no woman could disregard. Yet, it seems, there
was one woman whom he had not gauged. For all that Damaris answered
him even now was: "Will you go at last, sir; or can you think of
aught else to say&mdash;though I warn you 'twill be so much wasted
breath."</p>
<p>He gasped and blenched. His eyes bulged as he stared at her.</p>
<p>"You&mdash;you do not believe me?" he cried, as he had cried before,
but without the confidence that had informed the earlier
question.</p>
<p>"Believe you?" she said, and smiled. "I see that you have
thought me mad."</p>
<p>"Ask him!" he barked, and flung out a hand again towards
Gaynor.</p>
<p>"There is not the need," she said, with quiet confidence.</p>
<p>For a moment he continued to stare at her&mdash;her loyalty&mdash;her
foolish, headstrong loyalty had defeated him, he thought. How she
must love this fellow Gaynor that no doubt of him could find
admittance to her mind however spurred.</p>
<p>"You are right," he said at last. "There is not the need to
ask." And he, too, was smiling, never so wickedly. "You have but to
look. Look!" he commanded. "Look in his face and see for yourself
what is written there; see for yourself whether I have lied. Oh,
indeed, there is no need to ask."</p>
<p>She looked as he bade her. Captain Gaynor's continued silence
under that long and formidable accusation occurred to her, perhaps,
to cause her at last to do his lordship's bidding and turn her head
to look upon her lover's face.</p>
<p>What she saw there struck all her proud confidence to earth,
left her frozen and panic-stricken. His face was as the face of a
dead man; the very eyes were gone lustreless, and they could not
meet her own.</p>
<p>"Harry," she said, and the steadiness of her voice surprised
her. She considered that steadiness almost critically, just as she
considered the circumstance that this was the first occasion on
which she used his name; and to think that she must use it to ask
him&mdash;to ask him!&mdash;to refute a grotesque and foolish accusation. Yet
ask him she must, which meant that the accusation had ceased of a
sudden to seem to her grotesque and foolish. She was as one who
looked on at herself and at her fellow-actors in this scene. It was
as if her spirit were disembodied, to become a cold and critical
spectator.</p>
<p>"Harry, you will tell me that he lies. That is all that you need
tell me."</p>
<p>"Were I the man to have done what he says I have done, then I
should be a liar, too, and I should not scruple to answer you as
you desire," he said. His voice was husky and unsteady.</p>
<p>She did not understand. There was a confusing paradox in his
words. She weighed them in her mind, repeated them to herself, and
found them meaningless. She said so.</p>
<p>"But you mean that it is untrue?" she pleaded.</p>
<p>"Untrue, as there is a God above me," he answered, "yet every
word of it is true."</p>
<p>She drew away from him. In the half-benumbed condition of her
mind she could set but one interpretation upon his stricken
condition, his husky, vibrant voice; she saw nothing but subterfuge
and quibble in his words.</p>
<p>"True?" she echoed. "You gamed for me?"</p>
<p>He did not answer. He stood rigid, with hands clenched at his
sides. The temptation to explain assailed him for a moment; but he
allowed it to pass on unheeded and despised, as she must despise it
did he attempt to offer it. It were, he realised, but to make
himself seem viler and more pitiful. It could not be believed,
could carry no conviction; rather must every word of such
explanation as he had to offer seem the obvious pretence put
forward by a rogue and liar; every word and act that had passed
between them since his coming must add confirmation to the thing
that Pauncefort told her, since fundamentally that thing was
true&mdash;the blackest, foulest, untruest truth that was ever
uttered.</p>
<p>She waited, then, in vain, waited until his silence bore the
only answer.</p>
<p>"O God, pity me!" she wailed. She stumbled, and put a hand to
her brow. He flung out a hand to save her, and that act revived
her; with fresh panic she shrank from the touch of it as though it
had been redhot iron, and in shrinking she stiffened and regained a
wonderful composure.</p>
<p>Torn, lacerated, anguished, she stood before these beasts who
had fought for her and mangled her very soul in the strife, and she
determined in her pride to let them see nothing of her hurt.</p>
<p>She turned very quietly, and with figure erect, though her head
drooped a little, she passed down the narrow alley of that
court.</p>
<p>"Damaris!" cried Pauncefort as she approached him, his flaming
eyes devouring her. But before her glance he quailed and fell back.
There was something awful and forbidding there that he dared not
brave.</p>
<p>She continued on her way unhindered further. But as she was
passing underneath the archway in the hedge she heard her name
again.</p>
<p>"Damaris! Damaris!"</p>
<p>It was the cry of one in mortal agony. It was a voice that had
grown more dear to her than any human voice, than the sum of all
other human voices. She might account him vile and faithless; but
his call could still, it seemed, compel her. For she paused and
turned her head&mdash;turned to him that lovely, stricken face, those
deep brown eyes in which so lately he had seen his own reflection,
those pale trembling lips that so lately he had kissed. Thus, her
head turned, she waited, hoping madly even now against all
reasonable hope.</p>
<p>"One thing, at least, believe, O Damaris!" he cried. "One thing
I swear&mdash;and it is a thing that should efface all else. Until this
hour I did not know that you were Damaris Hollinstone. That much I
do swear by the God above us, Who is my witness."</p>
<p>If that were so, then indeed did it efface all else, as he had
said. If that were so, then all else could matter nothing. She
tried to think, to weigh his words. And then, to help to falsify
her scales, came a little wicked, scornful laugh from my Lord
Pauncefort.</p>
<p>"Of course," scoffed his lordship, "the gentleman must be
believed. Has he not deserved to be? Is he not the very soul of
honour?"</p>
<p>That gave her the right perspective, she opined; and listlessly
she continued on her way, and so out of their sight.</p>
<p>Like a sleep-walker she made her way to the house and ascended
the broad steps. Straight and evenly she held upon her course, up
the great staircase, to her own chamber. By the narrow white bed
she sank down upon her knees. Then pent-up nature had its way at
last and, kneeling there, she swooned away. And thus, perhaps, she
saved her reason.</p>
<p>Outside, in the rose-garden, my Lord Pauncefort and Captain
Gaynor eyed each other in silence for a moment after Damaris had
vanished. The Captain listened to her footsteps intently until they
had faded in the distance. Then, as if some arresting influence
were removed, as if a spell were shattered, he shook himself and
his sword flashed lividly from its scabbard.</p>
<p>"Now, you&mdash;you lackey!" he snarled. "It is my turn." And on the
words he sprang, trampling a bed of roses in his haste to come upon
his enemy.</p>
<p>Pauncefort would have avoided this. He was no coward, but to
fight a man in the Captain's white-heat of rage were utter suicide.
He saw his death in the blazing eyes that looked out of that livid,
distorted countenance.</p>
<p>He flung up a hand to arrest the other's attention. "This is
neither time nor place," he cried, "and the man that prevails will
be indicted for murder."</p>
<p>The Captain laughed.</p>
<p>"Send your friends to wait upon me," his lordship insisted, "and
you shall have what satisfaction you desire."</p>
<p>But as well might he, like Canute, have attempted to arrest the
tide.</p>
<p>"Draw, damn you," was his answer. "Draw, or I spit you as you
stand."</p>
<p>As my lord still hesitated, that long, thin blade flashed up and
its point came level with his heart. The sweat broke out cold upon
his brow. He drew perforce, and threw himself on guard.</p>
<p>The Captain pressed him wildly, a maniac, panting, sobbing,
jeering as he fought. He was terrific, and terror of him went deep
into his lordship's soul. He was vengeance incarnate, a bloodhound
upon its prey; and in imagination already my lord felt that bright,
cruel steel tearing at his throat.</p>
<p>"What place or season could be better?" the Captain mocked him,
as he drove his lordship back into a rose bed, across it, and plump
into another, that dancing point hovering ever with its deadly
menace along the line of his lordship's Adam's apple. "You are
fastidious indeed, if my lady's rose-garden will not suit you for a
death-bed; a dunghill would better meet your merits."</p>
<p>His lordship crashed backwards through a rose-bush, stumbled,
recovered and fought on in desperate defence. He had caught a sound
of running feet to hearten him. The Captain heard them too, a
moment later.</p>
<p>"You hear them running," he mocked the other. "So run your
sands. Your wages are due, my lord, and shall be paid you&mdash;thus!"
He beat aside the other's impotent blade, and his own point leapt
out to end the matter. But as it leapt, his lordship leapt too,
back and aside, and then fled in utter panic.</p>
<p>"O coward!" roared the Captain. "Coward that cannot even face
his death. Take it, then, from behind." And he sprang to follow.
His foot caught and tangled in the root of a brier. He plunged
forward, and fell upon his face. As he struggled to rise a hand
came to help him, a hand which retained its hold upon his arm after
assisting him to his feet.</p>
<p>As through a mist he saw the weather-beaten face of one of the
gardeners; another stood on his other side. He strove to throw off
the grip that held him. But the second man came to the assistance
of the first. Between them they overpowered him and deprived him of
his sword, muttering apologies the while for the force they were
employing.</p>
<p>My Lord Pauncefort, limp and breathless, leaned against a hedge,
and looked on, until one of the gardeners respectfully advised him
to be gone. Acting upon that excellent advice, he sheathed his
sword and withdrew, mopping his livid brow.</p>
<p>"You may go now," Gaynor called after him, "but do not think to
escape. It is but a postponement."</p>
<p>Lord Pauncefort, something recovered by now, turned to his
antagonist.</p>
<p>"In a regular manner I will meet you when you will," he panted.
"I shall expect you." And upon that he took his departure.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>Chapter 14. THE ROAD TO
TYBURN</h2>
<p>That afternoon Captain Gaynor, once more completely master of
himself, and showing no least outward sign of the storm through
which his spirit had so lately passed, of the rage that for a while
had so entirely governed him, took his leave of Lady Kynaston,
informing her that business of some urgency compelled him to depart
at once without awaiting Sir John's return.</p>
<p>Her ladyship made no allusion to the fracas in the rose-garden,
of which her servants had brought her word; but she did not doubt
that his departure was concerned with it, and that this urgent
business which he pleaded was the continuation of that quarrel.
Upon what grounds it had arisen she had formed the obvious opinion,
but dared not ask its confirmation. The Captain's manner was
respectfully forbidding. She did not go so far as to connect with
it the fact that both her daughter and her niece had kept their
respective chambers since the event.</p>
<p>Unquestioned, then, he was permitted to go his ways. He did not
see Damaris again, which caused him no surprise. To the
circumstance that he did not see Evelyn again he gave no thought,
perturbed as he was.</p>
<p>He put up at an obscure inn in the neighbourhood of Charing
Cross, and there he dismissed Fisher. That done he cast about him
for a friend who would wait upon Lord Pauncefort on his behalf, and
he bethought him of Sir Richard Templeton, whose residence in St
James's Street was within a stone's throw of Pauncefort House. It
was possible that the baronet had already departed for Devonshire.
But he would ascertain.</p>
<p>He went, then, to make the discovery that in St James's Street
he was already expected&mdash;not, indeed, by Sir Richard, who had, in
fact, departed already, but by the tip staves set to watch for him
by Lord Pauncefort, who counted upon a visit to himself. As the
Captain was turning out of Pall Mall he was suddenly confronted by
a couple of burly, coarsely garbed fellows, the foremost of whom
desired a word with him.</p>
<p>"With me?" he said, stiffening haughtily, yet more than guessing
their business.</p>
<p>"I have a warrant for you here," said the taller of the
twain&mdash;the very man who had been the leader of that raid at "The
World's End." He produced his parchment, and thrust it under the
Captain's very nose.</p>
<p>"I think ye'll be the person mentioned there&mdash;Captain
Jenkyn."</p>
<p>What, Captain Gaynor asked himself, could it avail him to deny?
They held him, and they would not be like to let him go upon a
denial, however emphatic. Moreover, it came to him suddenly that he
did not want to go. The cause he served was ruined for the time
being, set back for many a year, perhaps, if not for ever. The
woman he had come to love&mdash;he, who hitherto had held himself aloof
from all women, being wholly wedded to his master's service&mdash;deemed
him base and unworthy, and must so deem him. What, then, remained
in life?&mdash;the avenging of their betrayal upon that traitor
Pauncefort; and that, he knew, another hand than his would execute
ere long.</p>
<p>This arrest seemed to him in that despondent hour to resolve his
difficulties, to remove from him a heavy burden. He had sickened at
the very thought of returning to Rome with the dismal report of his
failure; he had sickened further at the thought of living on, a
dastard in the eyes of the only woman whose esteem he courted.</p>
<p>He considered his captors, and his glance was almost friendly.
Were they not good friends of his, the best he had ever known,
friends who came to him in the hour of his most urgent need? "'Tis
so," he said quite simply. "I am the man you seek. I am Captain
Jenkyn."</p>
<p>The trial of Captain Jenkyn&mdash;which, under instructions from the
Secretary of State was hurried forward, so that it took place
within three days of his arrest&mdash;attracted little notice at the
time.</p>
<p>As in the case of all matters relating to Jacobite plottings, it
was the desire of the Government that it should be disposed of as
quietly and speedily as possible. Therefore the news of his capture
was not allowed to transpire until his trial was over, and he
himself under sentence of death.</p>
<p>The prisoner's admission that he was Captain Jenkyn had saved
the court both time and trouble, for all that it was exercised not
a little by this sudden supineness in one whom they had every
reason to believe bold and resolute. They accounted for it upon the
assumption that, being caught, his resourcefulness and courage had
deserted him, and that perhaps he had hoped by pleading guilty to
the charges preferred to earn the clemency of his judges. Lord
Carteret was relieved to learn that the fellow had, himself,
admitted his identity, since that disposed of the necessity of
unmasking so very valuable a Government spy as Pauncefort. Under
the circumstances sufficient evidence was afforded by the three
tipstaves who had arrested him, and Sir Henry Tresh's lady, who
came forward to identify him with the man who had invaded her
chamber at "The World's End" on that evening when the plotters were
taken there.</p>
<p>The affair was a very brief one, summarily dealt with, as you
may see by consulting the "State Trials," where you will find all
the details of it if you have a mind for them. The prisoner himself
seemed intent upon assisting the court at every turn, readily
admitting, one after another, the charges brought against
him&mdash;whether concerned with previous visits to England or with the
present one&mdash;charges which had long been drawn up in preparation
for and awaiting such a day as this&mdash;a preparation which explains
the Government's ability to expedite the affair.</p>
<p>On one point only was the prisoner stubborn. Whilst ready to
admit that he was Captain Jenkyn, he would not admit that his real
name was Captain Gaynor. He did not deny it; but he refused to
admit it. They had arrested him, he said, as Captain Jenkyn, and as
Captain Jenkyn he was indicted. Let that suffice them.</p>
<p>This apparently curious attitude was based upon the reflection
that to admit his real identity might be to assist the Government
in proceedings against many of those who were known to have been
the associates of Captain Gaynor and against whom there was no
independent evidence of Jacobitism. He did not know to what extent
the absence of positive knowledge would hamper the Government; but,
in any event, he was resolved to make no admissions that might
assist it.</p>
<p>The court did not press, obedient always to its instructions. It
could have done so, obviously. It could easily have produced
witnesses to swear that he was Captain Gaynor; it could have
fetched Sir John Kynaston and his family from Chertsey; it might
even have thrust the discomfited Second Secretary Templeton into
the humiliating position of saying by what name he had known this
man who had so imposed upon him. But the Government desired, above
all, that the matter should be swiftly and quietly determined, with
as few witnesses and as little stir as might be necessary to
procure the conviction and sentence of so very desperate and
dangerous a rebel.</p>
<p>So the court waived this minor point, and as Captain Jenkyn our
Jacobite was duly sentenced to be hanged at Tyburn like any common
cutpurse.</p>
<p>There was calculation even in this, and wise calculation. He was
to die obscurely, at the hands of the common hangman; this, too, it
was deemed must prove a deterrent&mdash;that is to say, not merely the
death, but the inglorious manner of it.</p>
<p>There were few people in court when the sentence was passed, and
no single face did Captain Gaynor see with which he was acquainted.
Pauncefort, he imagined, might have looked in to gloat over his
plight. But Pauncefort wisely had kept away. Templeton, he had
fancied, might have desired to come there and satisfy himself of a
thing that to him must seem incredible. He marvelled at the Second
Secretary's absence; but then he did not know that the Second
Secretary found the ridicule which he had sought to heap upon Lord
Carteret concerning Captain Gaynor all recoiling upon himself; that
he had taken to his bed, announcing himself assailed by gout. (When
Templeton came to hear that sentence had been passed upon the
prisoner, he immediately resigned his office as the only possible
step remaining to his tattered dignity.)</p>
<p>Sir John Kynaston, the Captain had thought, would surely have
come. For he did not know that Sir John, like all the rest of the
world, was in ignorance of the fact that the trial was taking
place, conceiving that a trial upon charges so complex and
difficult to establish must be long in preparing.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor heard his sentence entirely unmoved. He had
expected nothing else. He was no trivial foolish plotter, but an
accredited agent, the disturber&mdash;as the indictment had it&mdash;of the
peace of the realm, a man who aimed at the overthrow of the dynasty
and, if necessary, at the death of the reigning sovereign, a man
who was looked upon as a spy of the Pretender's, and for whom there
could be no fate but the spy's.</p>
<p>Nor was his immobility merely external, or born of pride as it
is with so many who show themselves outwardly undaunted at the
prospect of an early death. His pulses remained calm, his heart
tranquil. It was no more than he desired. Standing in the face of
death he was enabled to do a thing he could not have done with life
before him&mdash;a thing to be done at all costs, even at the cost of
life itself, as he was doing it.</p>
<p>His trial took place on a Monday&mdash;the last Monday in June&mdash;and
he was informed that same evening that he was accorded three days
in which to set his affairs in order and make his soul. On the
following Thursday he was to hang.</p>
<p>The time was more than he desired; certainly more than he
required for what remained him to do. Relatives who mattered, he
had none. With his friends he did not dare to communicate for fear
of implicating them. To his master in Rome it would have pleasured
him to send a dying message of devotion. But he knew that no such
message would be allowed to reach its destination. There remained,
then, but the letter to Damaris to indite. When that was done, he
would be done with all matters of this world, and that was the
thing which the near approach of death enabled him to do, the thing
he could not have done had the way of life been open still before
him.</p>
<p>But it was not until the evening of Wednesday that he asked for
pen, ink and paper. He desired to make that communion with her
almost the very latest act of his swiftly ebbing life, setting at
last to paper the thoughts that since his trial had almost entirely
occupied his mind.</p>
<p>He headed his epistle:</p>
<blockquote>"From my cell in Newgate, on the even of my
death."</blockquote>
<p>That done he was fretted awhile, as he sat pen in hand, to know
how to address her. He solved the riddle, at last, by confining
himself simply to her name.</p>
<blockquote>Damaris [he wrote], when you read these lines I shall
have gone where neither execration nor compassion can pursue me,
and for that reason if for no other I have the consolation in these
my last hours of hoping that you will read what assuredly you would
not read were I still living and at large. For that reason alone I
think that I am glad to die, since death gives me certain
privileges and rights that are denied the living. Further still,
since I stand upon the dread threshold, since the gates of doom are
opening to admit me, and I am on the eve of facing my Eternal
Judge, I have a claim to be believed when I write of things that
might seem to you incredible did I still walk the great highway of
life. For it is not to be thought that I should in such an hour and
for no possible temporal profit sully myself with falsehood in
matters whereupon I might without temporal loss continue silent to
the end. When you consider, then, how little falsehood can avail me
now, when you consider how repellent it is even to the most
abandoned to deal in falsehood with the cold eye of death upon him,
the icy scythe severing him already from all earthly hopes, desires
and aspirations, I die content in the knowledge that what I am
writing here you must believe, and believing will come to give me
dead that treasure of your loving thought which living I could
never have claimed again.<br>
<br>
All that my Lord Pauncefort told you was true, yet no less true was
my assurance, when you asked me to deny his story&mdash;that only were I
the dastard he represented me could I have saved myself by the
falsehood of such denial. You did not understand. You do not yet.
For in these words, until all is known, must seem to dwell nothing
but confusion. Yet in them dwells the whole and absolute truth. For
never, O Damaris, was truth more untruly told than by Lord
Pauncefort on that evil day.<br>
<br>
It is true, then, that I played with him that ill-considered game.
It was on a night when he had lost to me some eight thousand
guineas, and he was bewailing that he stood upon the brink of utter
ruin and in peril of a debtor's gaol. In that ill-omened hour, I
bethought me that he had something yet to stake&mdash;his right to wed
you&mdash;for I believed him still betrothed to you&mdash;and it is true that
when I made him that proposal I had no thought of winning your own
self, and that your fortune was the real stake I saw upon the
board. But it is not true that by this&mdash;assuming that I succeeded
with you did I win that game with him&mdash;I was an adventurer seeking
your fortune for myself. My only thought was to devote that fortune
to the service of my master, who is in such dire straits for means
to his high ends. It was for him that I played that game, as my
Lord Pauncefort well knows. That I should sacrifice you to a cause
to which already I had sacrificed myself, in which I was
imperilling the life that at last I am about to lose, did not
then&mdash;nor does it yet&mdash;seem so heinous and unforgivable a
thing.<br>
<br>
His lordship won the cut. I paid him his guineas, and there the
matter ended, or would have ended but for the deception which for
reasons that I cannot fathom you thought it well, with your cousin,
to play upon me. For here we touch upon a truth which should efface
all other things in this mistaken enterprise, a truth which already
I have uttered. I did not know, nor ever dreamt, that you were
other than you represented yourself to be. I did not know, nor ever
dreamt, that you were Damaris Hollinstone until you told me so in
the garden a moment before his lordship came upon us. I looked upon
your cousin as the heiress&mdash;as, I suppose, you intended that I
should&mdash;and from the hour in which I met you I was glad that it was
not you&mdash;you, Damaris&mdash;whom I was pledged by the fortune of the
cards to abstain from wooing. I was glad in that hour to think that
I had not won a game, whose stakes my honour must have compelled me
to take up&mdash;for my honour is so bound up with the service of my
king and master that I must account dishonourable all measures that
do not aim at its advancement.<br>
<br>
There, my beloved, you have all the truth, and it is my hope as I
write&mdash;nay, it is my certainty&mdash;that the knowledge will help to
comfort you. You need not take shame in any thought that you were
the mere prey of an unscrupulous fortune-hunter, that you gave the
pure and holy treasure of your love to an adventurer, a mercenary
and a scoundrel.<br>
<br>
The thought that you will come to know and to understand enheartens
me and irradiates a season that must otherwise be very dark indeed.
It warms and gladdens me in this hour, and I shall go blithely to
my end, knowing that it is the modest price I pay for the sublime
good of sending you this undoubtable assurance.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow, for as long as thought can hold a place in this poor
head, that thought will be of you. What is to follow after I do not
know, nor do I fear. But if memory of life is still to be retained
in the great beyond, one memory will linger to make my heaven&mdash;the
memory of you, the consciousness that, knowing all, you will hold
the memory of me in tenderness until we meet again, if there be
meetings yonder.<br>
<br>
And so, my sweet lady, my dearest love, goodnight!</blockquote>
<p>It was late when the letter was concluded. He folded the sheets,
tied them together, sealed them and placed them in his
breast-pocket. Then he lay down, and soon was very peacefully
asleep.</p>
<p>Before the hangman's minions came to seek him in the morning, he
had given the letter into the hands of a friendly gaoler, together
with his purse, containing some twenty guineas in recompense for
the service the fellow had promised to do him.</p>
<p>Soon after eight the ordinary was introduced. He was a short,
stoutish man with mild eyes but a heavy jowl, and the stubble of
beard&mdash;a weeks growth at least&mdash;that blackened his face lent him an
almost ferocious aspect. He wore a soiled surplice; there was a
peck of snuff hanging about his bands and in the stubble of his
upper lip.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor gave him a very courteous if somewhat distant
welcome, presuming upon which the parson straightway fell to
talking of the Captain's soul. In this the Captain cut him
short.</p>
<p>"By your leave, good sir," said he, "I am of opinion, look you,
that I know more of my own soul than any man can tell me. So leave
me, I entreat you, to search it for myself. Meanwhile I can
minister to your body. You'll find some passable Hollands in that
jar, and there is a bottle of Burgundy which the gaoler has just
procured me. Pray honour me." And the Captain waved him to the rude
table where stood the vessels and a couple of drinking cans.</p>
<p>Thereafter he was but little troubled as he paced to and fro in
his cell, awaiting with some impatience the coming of those who
should take him for his last ride. They arrived at last, at a
little before eleven. They conducted him to the courtyard, where
the cart was waiting, a company of redcoats drawn up about it, and
every window of the gaol packed with villainous faces, their eyes
greedy of as much of the coming spectacle as it might be theirs to
witness.</p>
<p>He leapt lightly into the cart, and the ordinary, somewhat
flushed with Burgundy, clambered after him. Gladly would he have
dispensed with the fellow's company; but the rules did not permit
it. The parson must be with him to the end&mdash;must, indeed, intone
the psalm that would be sung at the turning-off. So perforce he
submitted with the best grace possible.</p>
<p>The driver stood up and turned to the prisoner. He held a length
of whipcord in his hand, and with this he pinioned the doomed man's
wrists behind his back. Then he took up a length of hempen rope
with a running noose in it, and deftly flicked this noose over the
Captain's head, leaving the end of the rope to hang behind him.
That done&mdash;and with the utmost nonchalance, the ruffian puffing,
meantime, a short and very foul pipe&mdash;the gates were opened. The
Sheriff's Deputy, a splendid figure in a gold-laced, scarlet coat,
gave the word of command, and the procession formed up and
started.</p>
<p>Ahead went the military in their red coats and mitre-shaped
hats, opening a way with their musket-butts through the mob that
had collected about the prison gates. Out into that seething, human
ocean rolled the cart. With dispassionate, almost pitiful eyes the
Captain looked upon that surface of upturned faces. One bestial
fellow was singing an obscene song allusive to the Captain's grim
condition. The Captain's eyes fell upon him in a look so profoundly
compassionate that the rascal broke off short in the middle of his
ditty, and after a moment's silence loosed a volley of lewd oaths
at him.</p>
<p>Looking, the Captain had wondered in what circumstances death
would come to find such a man, and he had seen&mdash;with that
extraordinary vision which is vouchsafed to men who stand upon the
Threshold&mdash;an image dreadful beyond words, an image that had
informed that profound compassion of his glance.</p>
<p>They pushed on. Crowds everywhere along the cart's way; every
window held a little mob, assembled there to see a man pass to his
death. To Harry Gaynor though ever dispassionate now and beyond
resentment of such trifles, there seemed something foul and obscene
in this curiosity.</p>
<p>He turned his gaze from it at last and met the mild eyes of the
ordinary They were full of tears. This he deemed very odd. He was
almost touched by it, forgetting entirely the amount of Burgundy
which the chaplain had consumed and in which his heart had been
softened so that the death of a stray dog would have rendered him
maudlin.</p>
<p>"Sir," he said very gently, "I beg that ye'll not weep for me
who do not weep for myself."</p>
<p>"That is the very reason of my weeping," the parson answered
him, and a tear detached itself at last, ran down his ample cheek
and joined the snuff on his neckband, all of which the Captain
observed with extraordinary interest.</p>
<p>"This is very odd," he said. "Do you, then, not believe in what
you teach? Do you not believe in a joyous and glorious
hereafter?"</p>
<p>The ordinary stared at him, and in his surprise forgot his
weeping. "Or is it that in your own experience this world has
proved it so extraordinarily delectable a place that you will not
barter it for any other?"</p>
<p>"Nay, nay, sir. But you, so young&mdash;" the fellow mumbled
inconclusively</p>
<p>"Am I not fortunate therein, since I shall be spared the
infirmities of age?"</p>
<p>"But to be cut off in mid-life, thus! It is so monstrous
pitiful. Oh, sir," he implored, "turn your thoughts, I beg, to
other things."</p>
<p>"They are so turned," the Captain answered quietly. "'Tis yours,
sir, that seem to be earth-bound, else why this grief in which I
cannot share? Sir, I do think you lay too much store by this little
moment we call life." And lo! it was the doomed man who set himself
to offer spiritual comfort to the parson.</p>
<p>"Since go we must in the end, what shall it signify that we go
today or tarry until tomorrow? Shall we bewail a day? Let me tell
you a story I heard once in the East."</p>
<p>"God forbid!" ejaculated the ordinary "In such an hour!" he
cried, all scandalised. "Would you still dwell upon your past when
your thoughts should be all of the future?"</p>
<p>The Captain smiled a little, and said no more. Still overlooking
the Burgundy, he accounted this fellow unfit for the ordeal of
bearing solace to the doomed. The task, it was evident, confused
him. There fell a silence between them. The cart, at a snail's
pace, was crawling up Holborn Hill, and everywhere surged the same
brutal, unfeeling crowd, staring, shouting, jesting, jeering.</p>
<p>Do not suppose that in this was any political rancour. Few,
indeed, had any notion of the offence for which the Captain was to
suffer. He was just a man going to be hanged, and a man going to be
hanged was ever an interesting and often a somewhat amusing
spectacle, always sufficient to justify a holiday.</p>
<p>The ordinary, watching his face, saw its almost contemptuous
wonder, and misinterpreted it.</p>
<p>"I marvel vastly, sir," he said, "that you did not get leave to
come in a coach."</p>
<p>"Could I have done so?" asked the Captain, with but indifferent
interest.</p>
<p>"At your own expense," the parson assured him.</p>
<p>"Ah, well, 'tis little matter."</p>
<p>But now another thought occurred to the ordinary. He had just
observed that the cart contained no coffin.</p>
<p>"Have you no friends?" he asked abruptly He was obliged to shout
almost that he might be heard above the din.</p>
<p>"Friends? I hope so."</p>
<p>"Where are they, then?"</p>
<p>The Captain's brows were knit in an instant. "Would you have
them here to swell this dreadful throng?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Nay, nay; but what provision have they made?"</p>
<p>"Provision, sir?"</p>
<p>"Ay, for your burial. Have they obtained leave to bury you?"</p>
<p>The Captain looked at him, and smiled. "The thought has never
engaged me. I had imagined, if I imagined anything, that all this
was the concern of those that hang me."</p>
<p>"Then ye were mistaken, sir."</p>
<p>"Does it signify so much?" he asked. And before the
extraordinary calm of the soldier's eyes, the ordinary became
suddenly aware that he was very far astray from the path of his
duty, that his thoughts were all for this wretched, perishable body
instead of for the imperishable soul.</p>
<p>He uttered some commonplaces of religion, some of the minor
currency that it was his trade to circulate. The soldier sat
silent, his thoughts far away, thankful for this respite from the
man's more trivial chatter of trivial things. He turned his head to
look forward, and he heard the ordinary's sudden, alarmed "Don't
look!"</p>
<p>But it did not deter him. They were trundling downhill now, the
mob growing more and more dense, the houses thinning. Below there,
at the hill's foot, the ground was black with swarming humanity,
and from the midst of it, a dark triangular object reared
itself&mdash;the sinister triple beam.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor eyed it steadily, then turned him to the ordinary
once more.</p>
<p>"We approach the journey's end," he said, and smiled. "It is
very well, for the journey itself is none so pleasant."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a>Chapter 15. EXECUTION</h2>
<p>Often has it been written that death is life's greatest
adventure. A paradox lurks subtly in the statement, which may be
the reason why the phrase has been esteemed of so many writers. But
of the death Captain Gaynor was to die that day at Tyburn, the
statement can be made in its literal meaning, and without paradox,
that it was the greatest adventure of his life.</p>
<p>I am tempted at this stage of my history to interpolate here a
memoir from the pen of the somewhat famous Dr Emanuel Blizzard. And
if upon due consideration I have resolved not to quote this
document verbatim, it is because, despite its wealth of detail,
this record is, after all, an incomplete one; for there was, of
course, much concerning Captain Gaynor's history with which the
famous professor was never made acquainted.</p>
<p>I write, however, with the doctor's memoir before me&mdash;indeed, in
its absence, it would be impossible for me to fill in the details
of this most extraordinary part of the history I am relating. Much
of that memoir&mdash;and my reader will be quick to discern the
passages&mdash;I transcribe almost literally, save that here and there I
have been able to elaborate from other records at my disposal
certain points which to the doctor remained perforce obscure.
Moreover, it will better contribute to the lucidity of my own
narrative if I marshal the events in the order of their
happening&mdash;an order by no means observed by the professor.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>As the cart bearing Captain Gaynor came under the fatal beam,
the vociferations of the crowd abated. They sank to a mere murmur,
to a subdued hissing whisper, as of a breeze stirring through a
forest, and lastly into an absolute and deathly silence&mdash;the
impressive expectant hush of nature when a storm impends.</p>
<p>The ordinary was reading aloud the Office for the Dead. Jack
Ketch, the ruffianly driver of the cart, was on his feet. He took
the end of the rope that hung from the noose round Captain Gaynor's
neck, swung it a moment to gather the required momentum, then threw
it over the beam and deftly caught it again as it came round and
down. In an instant he had knotted it. In another he had resumed
his seat, taken up his whip, and with a stinging cut sent his horse
at a half-gallop down the lane which the military had opened out
for him in the mob.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Captain Gaynor found himself alone now in the cart. The parson
had vanished, though he could not remember at what precise stage of
the journey the fellow had left him. All round the vehicle seethed
the crowd, yelling, shouting, cursing, laughing once more, but they
seemed no longer to heed him.</p>
<p>Onward the cart rolled, with a thundering rumble now, which
increased in volume as they went, and the Captain observed with
faint curiosity that those who were not quick to avoid it went down
under its wheels. Theirs were the curses and foul oaths with which
his ears were being deafened.</p>
<p>Soon, however, these and all other sounds began to fade. They
had left the crowd behind, about that triangular structure which he
knew stood some way in the rear. They were coming into the open
country. The wheels of the cart still rumbled, but less noisily
now, and as they rolled presently over a soft spread of emerald
turf this sound faded almost entirely.</p>
<p>The Captain discovered that his hands were no longer pinioned,
and this was as mystifying as that sudden disappearance of the
parson, for he could not recall at what particular stage of his
progress the bonds had been removed.</p>
<p>He turned, and saw before him, sitting upright upon his plank,
the immobile figure of the driver in his ragged three-cornered hat
and coat of rusty black. The fellow still puffed his short clay
pipe, for the smoke of it hung in wreaths about his head. He
marvelled at his unconcern and apparent disregard of his
prisoner.</p>
<p>They were ambling gently now down a lane between hedgerows that
were aflame with extraordinarily rich blossoms. The sunlight was
dazzling. It shone upon the waters of a pond, which he perceived
through a gap in the hedge, so brilliantly that his eyes were hurt
and dazzled.</p>
<p>It occurred to him then that since Jack Ketch was so unobservant
and unconcerned, and since there was none other by to hinder him,
he need not continue in the cart. He threw a leg over the rail at
the back, and leapt lightly to the ground.</p>
<p>The vehicle rolled on. He stood watching it as with incredible
swiftness it diminished in size down that interminable avenue. When
it was no more than a speck in the far distance, he turned and went
through the gap in the hedge with that unbearable reflection of
sunlight on water beating upon his eyes; and turn which way he
would he could not avoid it. There was water all about him now, and
it all shone fiercely, like a mirror in the very eye of the sun. At
last he perceived a bridge. He advanced towards it, and crossed it,
shutting his eyes to exclude that fierce glare, yet still conscious
of it even through closed lids. He opened them again to make the
discovery that this bridge which he had crossed was the rustic
structure leading into the garden of Priory Close. Strange, he
thought, that he should never before have observed what a deal of
water flowed down the little ravine it spanned. And then he ceased
to wonder about anything, for before him stood a radiant Damaris
with arms held out in welcome.</p>
<p>He plunged forward with a cry, and sank into her embrace.</p>
<p>"My dear," she said, "why have you left me so long to my bitter
thoughts of you?"</p>
<p>He sought to answer her, but could not; her arms were laced so
tightly about his neck that he could not speak. She was strangling
him. Had he been able to speak he would have told her so. But he
could not. Yet although the choking was hurting him, he did not
attempt to struggle. It was so good to lie there. He was very, very
weary. He nestled his head more closely upon her breast. A great
drowsiness overcame him, and he fell asleep.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Between two of the three uprights of that triangular structure,
the body of Captain Gaynor swung gently to and fro, as if the warm
summer breeze made sport with it.</p>
<p>About the foot of the gibbet there was an open square,
maintained by a hedge of men in scarlet coats and mitre-shaped
hats. The drums had long since ceased to beat.</p>
<p>Came a sharp word of command, and a line of muskets flashed up
and rattled to rest, each upon the shoulder of its owner; another
word of command, and the redcoats manoeuvred into marching order,
four abreast. Then the drums rolled out again, and the scarlet
phalanx swung briskly away through the tumultuous crowd.</p>
<p>The show was at an end.</p>
<p>Into the open square which the military had maintained at the
gallows' foot sprang now some half-dozen resolute and bustling
ruffians. The crowd surged after them, like waters suddenly
released, and a cart pressed forward with the foremost.</p>
<p>The tallest of these ruffians, with a knife between his teeth,
shinned up one of the vertical timbers and threw a leg over the
cross-beam from which the Captain's body was swinging. With his
knife he slashed through the rope, and the body tumbled into the
arms of his companions below. Two of them bore it away. The others
plied elbows and tongues to force a passage through the rabble with
their prize. They gained the cart, flung in their limp burden, and
as one of them vaulted after it, the driver cracked his whip and
cursed the people volubly and obscenely. A way was reluctantly
opened, and into this the little cart pressed, driven forward like
a wedge. Slowly it won through.</p>
<p>Some little distance from the gallows a chaise had been drawn
up. In this sat an elderly gentleman, who, with a grey face and
dull, pain-laden eyes, had watched the execution. His aspect was so
profoundly grief-stricken that the crowd about his carriage had
felt the influence of it, and had preserved an almost utter
silence. They resented being constrained to this despite
themselves, for they felt that their enjoyment of the show had been
marred; but for all their resentment they had not been able to
shake off the spell of that anguished old countenance.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as the body was being borne away, Sir John
Kynaston&mdash;for he it was&mdash;seemed to rouse himself from his trance.
He uttered a cry and carried a trembling hand to the carriage door.
He fumbled at it for some moments, opened it at last, and sprang
down, shouting. But his voice was lost in the terrific uproar. He
attempted to struggle through the crowd. But, spent as was his
strength by grief, he was unequal to the effort, and after a
quarter of an hour's striving he had got no farther than the foot
of the gallows, whilst the cart was vanishing into the Edgware
Road.</p>
<p>He implored those about him to pass the word along that he would
pay the snatchers handsomely for their booty. An attempt was made
to do his will, and the message travelled some little way, but it
was scattered and lost at last.</p>
<p>In the end he was forced to give up the attempt. Blaming himself
for not having thought of the matter sooner, he made his way with
feeble, unsteady steps&mdash;his vigour all sapped&mdash;back to his
carriage. The crowd was growing thinner now He regained his chaise,
and so returned in sorrow to Chertsey, deriving, if possible, an
added grief from the reflection that he had neglected to perform
the last rites by the body of his old friend's boy.</p>
<p>Priory Lodge in those days was haunted by an atmosphere of
gloom. Evelyn and Damaris remained both invisible even to Sir John,
both pleading indisposition.</p>
<p>Evelyn was overcome with terror at the ruin she had wrought, for
she accounted that Captain Gaynor's arrest and execution had all
resulted from the disclosure of his identity when Lord Pauncefort
spied upon the lovers in the garden. She it was who had fetched his
lordship to Chertsey by her letter, and she, herself, had conducted
him to the garden that he might surprise his betrothed in the arms
of another.</p>
<p>It had been with her no more than an act of petty vengeance, she
could scarce have said for what. But she had intended that it
should remain petty; she had never dreamt of such tragic
consequences as these. She was prostrated by them and by her
consciousness of guilt; and it went as near to making a woman of
her and arousing her dormant intelligence as anything could do. She
had not seen Damaris since the happening&mdash;now some ten days old&mdash;in
that garden. She had been afraid to face her, and now her fear had
increased to terror since Sir John had brought word three days ago
of the sentence of death that had been passed upon their whilom
guest. That had been terrible enough. But now came the still more
terrible news&mdash;again brought by Sir John&mdash;that Captain Gaynor had
been hanged.</p>
<p>In her anguish, in her overwhelming panic, Evelyn wanted to die.
She could never again meet the eyes of Damaris. She was&mdash;she told
herself that night, as she lay wide-eyed upon her bed&mdash;a murderess.
Once, in the grey hour of dawn she rose from her bed, fell on her
knees beside it, and prayed&mdash;not to heaven, but to the spirit of
Captain Gaynor&mdash;for forgiveness. Conceiving that this spirit being
disembodied must be now all knowing, she cried out to it that she
had not meant to work this havoc, that her deed had been light and
heedless, that never would she have performed it could she have
dreamed of such consequences to himself as these.</p>
<p>Some comfort she took in the reflection that he must know, and
that knowing all he must forgive, as all must who know all.</p>
<p>It was on the morrow that Sir John brought himself to question
his wife on the subject of the Captain's sojourn at Priory Close.
His wife, with habitual irrelevance and her passion for the
unimportant, related to him the deception that had been practised
by the girls. He gathered from this and from what else she added
that Harry Gaynor had wooed Damaris under the impression that he
was wooing Evelyn; he learnt that Pauncefort had been at Priory
Close on the very morning of the day upon which the Captain had
been arrested; and he was able for himself to piece together the
event, save that he knew nothing of the revelations that had driven
Damaris away in a loathing of Harry Gaynor as great almost as had
been that which earlier had turned her from Pauncefort.</p>
<p>He sat in the library pondering it all, and thinking of the
elder Gaynor who had been his friend, his more than brother, and
thanking God that he had not lived to see this day of sorrow. He
pondered the hope he had nourished of wedding his only child to
Harry. That hope must, he saw, in any case have been frustrated. It
mattered little now. For Evelyn, indeed, it was better as it was;
better that she had not loved him. And then he sat up sharply with
a sudden, a terrible thought. It moved him to rise and go in quest
of his wife again.</p>
<p>"What ails Evelyn?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"I do not know, my dear. The child is very odd always, and very
headstrong." Lady Kynaston sighed. "I never had her
confidence."</p>
<p>"How long has she been ailing? How long has she kept her
chamber?"</p>
<p>Her ladyship considered a moment. "Why, ever since Captain
Gaynor left us," said she.</p>
<p>He was answered, he thought. His daughter, too, was stricken by
the same blow. She had conceived for the Captain an unrequited
passion. His heart bled for her, and in his compassion he went at
once to seek her.</p>
<p>He found her sitting listlessly by the window of her room, her
hands idle in her lap. The roses had all fled from her cheeks; she
looked haggard, so haggard and woebegone that even her air of
intense femininity had departed from her. She raised heavy eyes to
her father's face, and he observed the dark lines under them that
told the tale of sleepless nights.</p>
<p>"My dear!" he said. "My poor child!" He held out his arms to
her, and there were tears in his old eyes.</p>
<p>His pity stabbed her. She did not understand it, but she
understood that it was sprung from some misapprehension.</p>
<p>"Ah, don't touch me, father!" she cried. "You don't know, you
don't know!"</p>
<p>"I think I do," he answered very gently.</p>
<p>"You do?" He saw horror in the eyes so suddenly lifted to stare
fit him. At once she realised that he had no knowledge of the
truth, that something very different was in his mind. He came upon
her very ripe for confession, at a point where, did she not share
her burden with another, she must sink under it and die, she
thought. She rose, flung herself upon his breast, and there,
through a storm of sudden weeping, in a voice broken by sobs, she
poured out her miserable story.</p>
<p>He listened, frowning awhile. But when the end was reached he
did not put her from him in aversion, as she had feared. Gently he
stroked her golden head.</p>
<p>"For the unworthy thing you did, Evelyn, you have been punished
enough," he said. "Do not torment yourself with the supposition of
a greater sin. It was not you who gave Captain Gaynor to the
hangman, nor did Lord Pauncefort do it in consequence of what he
witnessed here, nor yet did he, as you suppose, discover Captain
Gaynor's identity as a result of what you enabled him to overhear.
He knew it already. He was himself a Jacobite who had betrayed his
fellow-plotters. So comfort you at least with the knowledge of
that."</p>
<p>She comforted herself very speedily and completely, as such
natures can. She slept soundly that night, and on the morrow when
she made her appearance at the breakfast-table she had resumed much
of her habitual air.</p>
<p>Nor was she any longer oppressed by the fear of meeting Damaris,
since in no degree now did she account herself guilty towards her
cousin. It was true that she had done a meanness in writing to Lord
Pauncefort and bringing him to spy upon the lovers, but for the
rest she had her father's word for it that her action had nowise
altered the inevitable course to which the events of these last
days had been fore-ordained. But if she no longer feared to meet
Damaris, yet she could not go the length herself of seeking
Damaris, nor for that matter could Sir John, despite the urgings of
his deeply sympathetic nature.</p>
<p>There was not, however, the need. Damaris, of her own accord,
came forth on the following evening from her retirement, and sought
her uncle.</p>
<p>He was in the library, writing to his brother, when suddenly she
stood before him, almost ghostly in her intense pallor as she
paused among the shadows by the door for his leave to intrude a
moment. He sprang up at sight of her and went to meet her, and even
as he was shocked by the change that grief had wrought in her, so
was she shocked by the greyness of his face, the haggard air where
joviality had ever sat and the dullness of those blue eyes that
usually were so bright and smiling.</p>
<p>He held out his hands and she took them, her fingers tightening
upon them. But for this man who had been more than father to her,
her loneliness must be utter now.</p>
<p>"How cold you are, my child," he murmured. Then his voice broke.
"Oh, my poor Damaris!" His voice told her that&mdash;no matter how&mdash;he
was informed of all, or, at least, of all that mattered.</p>
<p>"I came to talk to you of him," she said quietly, her voice, as
controlled as her face, like her face showing, despite her, the
suffering through which she was passing.</p>
<p>He led her forward to a chair, and when she was seated he went
to stand by the overmantel. So had he stood, she remembered, on
that day when at Pauncefort's side by the window there, she had
looked upon him as her enemy, and defied him. How bitterly, now,
she repented her that momentary defection! How profoundly she loved
him, since today, in his affection for Harry Gaynor, she discovered
a fresh and very solemn bond between them.</p>
<p>"He desired me to give you certain messages when he was on the
point of setting out," she said, and neither of them deemed it
strange that she should find no need to mention any name. "They do
not amount to very much, but he dared not write them, he said, lest
his letter should miscarry. As it is, you no doubt will have
guessed what he would wish to say." And she repeated with a rare
fidelity the words he had entrusted to her.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said heavily, when she had done. "All that I
understood."</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I have since had a letter from him," she said.</p>
<p>"He wrote to me from Newgate, on the eve of&mdash;on Thursday last.
You&mdash;you were with him&mdash;at the end?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I was there," replied Sir John. "But he did not see me."</p>
<p>She swayed on her chair. She passed a hand over her brow, her
face strained with the effort of self-control. "How&mdash;how did he
die?" she asked at last.</p>
<p>"Happily, I think," Sir John replied. "He was smiling at the
end, when&mdash;when he stood up. What had he to fear?" cried the
baronet, a sudden vigour returning to his voice, a defiance almost.
"What had he to fear? He was as brave and gallant a gentleman as
ever drew the breath of life, a man whom all honoured and loved,
and he died a martyr to truth and right. What then, had he to fear
in death?" The tears ran down the old man's cheeks, and his voice
sank again, as he concluded: "Had the poor lad been my own son I
should have been as proud of him as I was of the affection with
which his father honoured me."</p>
<p>She rose and came to him. She reached up to put her arms about
his neck, drew down his head, and very gently kissed him. And so,
quietly, her sorrow ever silent and contained, she left him.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-16" id="ch-16"></a>Chapter 16. RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>For almost all the matter contained in this chapter I
acknowledge an indebtedness that will presently be apparent to that
memoir of Dr Blizzard which I have mentioned, and upon which
already I have drawn for those dream-sensations experienced by
Captain Gaynor when he was turned off and left swinging after the
cart had drawn away from under him.</p>
<p>I closely followed that portion of the memoir up to the point at
which the Captain lost consciousness, or&mdash;to adhere strictly to his
own impressions&mdash;at which he sank to sleep, his head pillowed upon
the bosom of Damaris.</p>
<p>When next he awakened it was in surroundings vastly different
from those under which he had sunk to slumber, as he believed. Here
was no sunlit garden, but a square, whitewashed chamber, lighted
not only by a window in one of its walls, but also from
another&mdash;and a very large one this&mdash;in the ceiling immediately
above him.</p>
<p>Someone was bending over him, and a face was peering into his.
But it was not the lovely, beloved face of Damaris. Instead, it was
a keen, lean, almost wolfish face, with leathern cheeks and very
piercing little eyes that were considering him through horn-rimmed
spectacles.</p>
<p>He lay quite still and only half conscious as yet, looking up
into that face, and neither wondering nor caring to whom it might
belong. Then, as his awakening proceeded, he was conscious that his
body was cold and stiff and that there was a strong taste of brandy
in his mouth. His left wrist, he discovered, was in the grip of
this wizened-faced man; but it was a very gentle grip, with a
finger pressing lightly upon his pulse.</p>
<p>Then, quite suddenly, memory like a flood poured in upon his
consciousness, and his awakening was complete.</p>
<p>He attempted to rise from his recumbent position, and the effort
set a thousand hammers swinging in his brain. His head, he found,
was just an ache, a globe of pain, no more. The window above him
appeared to slide to and fro, the couch upon which he lay heaved
under him, and the wizened face of his companion dilated and
contracted horribly as he watched it. He groaned and closed his
eyes. The pain spread downwards through his body, which lay stark
there upon a table&mdash;for such was the nature of his couch. Then, at
last, the tide of torment slowly ebbed again, leaving him bedewed
from head to foot with sweat.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes once more. He attempted to speak, and this
fresh effort centralised the pain in his throat and tongue. They
seemed swollen to elephantine proportions.</p>
<p>The leathern mask of a face above him appeared suddenly to crack
across. A very wide and quite lipless mouth had opened, and from it
issued a queer, clucking sound.</p>
<p>"Tut, tut! Tut tut! Better keep still! Better keep still!"</p>
<p>The hand had already left his wrist, and now the figure turned
and moved away a little to another table under the window in the
wall. Captain Gaynor was able to follow it with his eyes without
moving his head. He observed the man to be of middle height and
very thin. He wore black velvet breeches, black silk stockings and
shoes with steel buckles. He was without a coat, and the sleeves of
his waistcoat and shirt were rolled up to the elbows of two long,
thin, sinewy arms. His waistcoat itself was concealed by a coarse,
yellowish apron in which there were several dull, brown patches.
This apron covered him in front from chin to waist; the remainder
of it had been rolled into a rope and was twisted round his middle.
The table to which he had moved was of a good size and of plain
deal. Part of it was encumbered by phials of all forms and sizes;
but in a clear space in the middle, upon a spread cloth, was an
array of very bright instruments of queer shapes, whose purpose the
Captain could not have guessed had his mind been in a condition to
attempt the task.</p>
<p>Dr Emanuel Blizzard&mdash;for this was the identity of the man&mdash;took
up a short-stemmed lily-shaped glass, and held it up in one of his
enormous, bony hands. From one of the phials he poured into it a
ruby-coloured liquid; from another he added something else that was
quite colourless, and he did this with great care, pausing, adding
another drop or two, pausing again, and yet again adding a drop.
Then he set the phial down, and carrying the glass he once more
approached the table where the Captain lay.</p>
<p>He thrust his left hand under his patient's head, and raised it
very slowly and gently. But for all his gentleness those great
hammers were set to swing again, and they crashed forward and
backward in Harry Gaynor's brain. The rim of the glass was brought
to his lips.</p>
<p>"Drink this," said the gruff voice, and obediently, without any
will of his own, the Captain painfully swallowed the fluid. He was
not conscious of any flavour in it at the time. But afterwards,
when his head had been lowered once more, and the room had ceased
to swing about him like the cabin of a ship, he became aware of a
fresh pungency in his mouth, soothing and cooling and seeming to
reduce its inflammation.</p>
<p>In the moment that his head had been raised, he had perceived in
a subconscious way that he was quite naked, that there was blood on
his left leg, that a ribbon of this blood ran to the little puddle
reaching to the table's edge. Now, as he lay back once more, he
noticed a faint dripping sound, recurring at very brief and very
regular intervals. Dimly, and without much interest, he connected
this sound with the puddle he had observed.</p>
<p>The events of the morning were coming back to him now in detail.
He remembered the cart, the crowd, his pinioned wrists, the parson
who had ridden with him, the glimpse he had of the gallows when he
had turned his head as they were going down the hill. What happened
afterwards, he could not remember until he came to that point where
he had found himself in the open country, still in the cart at
first, and later crossing a bridge over a great expanse of glaring
water to find Damaris awaiting him.</p>
<p>He could not distinguish between the real and the imagined. That
all this had happened to him he never doubted; but he could not
explain it, any more than he could explain how he came to be lying
stark naked upon a deal table with blood flowing from his leg and
dripping into some vessel on the floor whilst a stranger tended
him.</p>
<p>It would seem as if he had not been hanged after all, and he
wondered why was this. But he did not wonder with any great
activity; there was no vigorous mental effort to resolve this
mystery. His brain was too tired and indolent for the exertion. The
indolence gained upon him; it became a torpor, and very gently he
sank once more into oblivion.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>His next awakening was very different. It took place some twelve
hours later, early in the morning of the following day. He was abed
now in a solid furnished room that was full of sunlight, and for
some moments he lay still, staring up at the white, flat canopy
overhead. Then quite suddenly he sat up. Pain shot through his head
once more, to bring back a dim memory of his last awakening. But it
was endurable now, though still acute.</p>
<p>His sudden movement had been answered by another. From a
chintz-covered settle ranged against the wall on his right sprang
now the slender figure of the doctor. An arm went round the Captain
to support him in his sitting posture; the little piercing eyes
considered him again through those spectacles with their great horn
rims, and Gaynor observed that, for all its wolfishness, the face
was genial and kindly.</p>
<p>The wide lipless mouth opened, and as before it emitted that
clucking sound; but the leathery, close-shaven countenance was
wrinkled in a smile.</p>
<p>"Eh, and how do we feel now, eh? Better?" And as he spoke, the
professor stamped his foot three times upon the floor&mdash;an obvious
signal to someone below.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" the bewildered patient asked him.</p>
<p>"Eh? My name is Blizzard&mdash;Doctor Emanuel Blizzard, professor of
anatomy, eh. And you're safe and snug in my house."</p>
<p>"In your house, Doctor&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Blizzard, sir&mdash;Emanuel Blizzard."</p>
<p>"And how came I here?" the Captain asked, his wonder and
bewilderment increasing. His voice was so husky that he could not
speak above a whisper, and he was conscious still of a numbness of
tongue and throat.</p>
<p>The professor clucked again. "Tut-tut! 'Tis a long story that,
and a strange. You shall hear it when you are more recovered. Ye're
weak, eh? Ye will be. I bled you very thoroughly. But we'll soon
renew what's lost."</p>
<p>A knock fell on the door. The anatomist set the pillows behind
his patient so that they supported him in an upright position. Then
he sped to the door, opened it, and returned with a tray on which
was a bowl, a flagon of red wine and a glass. This tray he placed
upon a table by the head of the bed. He took up the bowl, which was
filled with steaming broth.</p>
<p>"Ye'll be hungry, eh?" he said, his head on one side. The
Captain nodded weakly. "Aha! 'Tis very well."</p>
<p>He approached the patient, and with a horn spoon proceeded
himself to feed him. Then he carefully measured him a half-glass of
Burgundy, and he held it to his lips, what time the Captain slowly
drained it.</p>
<p>"Another?" he asked. "Tut, tut! Better not. Better not, eh? We
must go slowly. <i>Piano si va sano</i>, as the Italians say. For
the present&mdash;<i>ne quid nimis</i>, eh?"</p>
<p>Gently as a woman might have done, he replaced the pillows, and
induced his patient once more to lie down. Captain Gaynor obeyed
him, too feeble, too utterly bewildered to resist. Something had
happened to him; something altogether inordinate; but what that
something might be he had no faintest conception, and least of all
could he conceive how he came into the house of a professor of
anatomy who treated him with such tenderness and solicitude. There
was one point, however, that so plagued him that he must have
enlightenment upon it. He looked up into that wolfish yet kindly
countenance.</p>
<p>"Then&mdash;I was not hanged?" he inquired feebly.</p>
<p>"Hanged!" cried the other. "Tut, tut! Go to sleep. You'll be
stronger when next you wake. Go to sleep now."</p>
<p>The prediction proved true enough. The broth and the wine
spreading warmth through that debilitated frame bore a torpor with
them, to which the Captain very shortly succumbed, notwithstanding
the question with which he still plagued himself.</p>
<p>When next he opened his eyes upon that room, the sunshine had
left it. By the mellow light and the tepid air that came through
the open casement he knew it to be eventide. A stout, middle-aged
woman with red polished cheeks, that gave her face the appearance
of a giant apple, occupied a chair near the bed. She smiled
reassuringly when she encountered his questioning gaze, and she
rose at once.</p>
<p>"Better now?" she greeted him.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor was better indeed, and he was conscious of an
appetite that was keen as a razor's edge. He said so, and found his
voice much stronger, whilst there was hardly any of the sensation
of pain in tongue and throat. His head, too, was clearer, and it no
longer ached when he moved it, as he did by way of testing its
condition.</p>
<p>"I'll go call the doctor," she said. "He's resting below."</p>
<p>In a very few minutes the anatomist was at his patient's
bedside. In another few minutes there was more broth and Burgundy
for the Captain, and even a few slices of capon's breast and a
little wheaten bread.</p>
<p>"And now," said Captain Gaynor, reclining comfortably among his
heaped-up pillows when he had consumed a meal which he found all
too spare, "will you tell me how I come here, and how it befell
that I was not hanged? What happened to me?"</p>
<p>The professor looked at him, meditatively stroking his smooth
chin.</p>
<p>"It did not befall that you were not hanged," he said slowly.
"Ye were hanged&mdash;two days since."</p>
<p>"Hanged?" The Captain started up. Horror and incredulity were
blent in his countenance.</p>
<p>"Tut, tut, nowl" clucked Dr Blizzard. "Let us be calm, eh!
Theres not the need to start and cry out. It's over, and it's not
to do again. <i>Nemo bis punitur pro eodem delicto</i>, remember.
That is the law, eh?"</p>
<p>But the impossibility of punishing a man twice for the same
offence was the last thing that exercised the Captain's thoughts
just then.</p>
<p>"But if I was hanged," said he, his face an utter blank,
"how&mdash;how come I to be alive, for I am alive, am I not? I am not
dead and dreaming, perchance?"</p>
<p>"Eh! Why, to be sure you're alive, and in a week or so I make no
doubt but ye'll be about again as sound as ever you were."</p>
<p>"But how&mdash;how, if I was hanged?"</p>
<p>"Because if a man won't drown who's born to hang, neither will a
man hang who's born to drown, eh? 'Tis the best reason I can think
of, faith! And, faith! it's reason enough." Still understanding
little or nothing, the Captain stared at the doctor.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I don't understand even now," he said weakly. "How came I
here?"</p>
<p>"Eh? Ah, that is another matter, and well may it exercise you.
It was this wise." The doctor took snuff in prodigious quantities,
then snapped and pocketed his box, and sat upon the edge of the bed
facing his patient. "It was this wise. When you had hanged for the
term of twenty minutes&mdash;as by law prescribed&mdash;you were cut down by
a couple of rascals who know where to obtain a guinea or two for
the fruit of the leafless tree, as they humorously term it. And
here let me say that ye were mighty fortunate in that ye gave no
thought to your own burial and that no friends of yours saw to the
reparation of that omission. He, he!" he laughed on a thin high
note. "But for that&mdash;faith!&mdash;ye'ld not be sitting there drinking
Burgundy. Ye'ld have been snug under a tombstone by now, eh!</p>
<p>"Well, then," he pursued, "these rascals brought you hither in a
cart, and never was there living man who looked more dead. Ye
deceived even myself, when I had you lying stark upon my table, for
you'll understand that I had bought you to dissect you, and I never
so much as suspected how I'd been swindled&mdash;that ye were not a
corpse at all&mdash;until I had run my scalpel across your breast;
you'll feel the sting of the scratch belike. It was not a cut;
'twas no more than skin-deep, to mark the line I was to follow. But
behold! this line I had drawn turned suddenly bright crimson. If I
say that I was amazed, I say nothing. I ran my finger along it and
withdrew it moist with blood.</p>
<p>"There could be no doubt then that ye were not dead, eh? But
whether you had travelled too far into the dark valley ever to be
dragged back again to the world of the living was what I could not
say I held a mirror to your lips, and found it filmed with moisture
after a moment. I set my finger to your pulse, but could discover
no movement in it. So I opened a vein in your leg to stimulate the
heart by setting the blood a-flowing; and within ten minutes you
had opened your eyes and were endeavouring to sit up.</p>
<p>"Since then I've done little more than leave you to the <i>vis
medicatrix naturae</i>. For Nature, sir, has endowed you very
richly; so richly that I could almost regret the loss of the two
guineas I gave those rascals for your anatomy&mdash;for ye've defrauded
me, sir, in a most heartless fashion, eh!"</p>
<p>The Captain smiled feebly at the jest. But it was something that
he was able to smile at all, now that he had the full account of
this most extraordinary adventure.</p>
<p>"But you repay me richly in another way," the anatomist
pursued.</p>
<p>"I can assure you, sir, you shall not be out of pocket in any
way," said the Captain.</p>
<p>"Pish! Tut, tut!" The professor waved one of his great bony
hands contemptuously.</p>
<p>"Tell me," said the Captain presently, "is it not a very
extraordinary thing to have happened?"</p>
<p>"Extraordinary? Godso! Ye're not supposing that it happens every
week, eh?"</p>
<p>"Have you ever known such another case?"</p>
<p>"As to that, why yes&mdash;though never in my own experience. Did ye
never hear of John Smith the housebreaker&mdash;a few years ago&mdash;who was
reprieved after he had been turned off and hanged for a quarter of
an hour? When the reprieve arrived it scarce seemed worth while to
make haste to cut him down, he looked so dead. Yet to all the
world's amazement the rogue revived to return to his house-breaking
trade. Then there was the case of Anne Green at Oxford, over fifty
years ago. She was hanged for over half an hour, and like yourself
fell into the hands of an anatomist&mdash;a Dr Petty&mdash;who revived her.
And there have been others. Still, the event is rare enough&mdash;so
rare that a man should be thankful when it serves him, eh!"</p>
<p>The Captain lay back among his pillows and abandoned himself
freely to his amazement, and to the thoughts and speculations born
of his astounding situation.</p>
<p>As the doctor had said, "<i>Nemo bis punitur pro eodem
delicto</i>"; and so from the law of England he had nothing more to
fear, even should his identity be discovered. But he did not think
that it need be.</p>
<p>Very soon his thoughts turned to Damaris, and it was with a
sudden fearful doubt that he asked himself what result his revival
would have there. How had she received his letter? There was, he
thought, but one way in which she could receive it. Yet his being
alive again, or alive still, must alter everything and might modify
her feelings if they were&mdash;as he thought they must be&mdash;of
forgiveness. The doubt was most cruelly tormenting. He turned
suddenly to the doctor.</p>
<p>"How soon," he inquired, "shall I be in case to depart?"</p>
<p>"Tut!" clucked the professor. "Here's a great haste, now! Why,
if you are quiet and obedient to me, perhaps in a week or a little
longer you will sufficiently have regained your strength. You're
healthy, amazing healthy. But I've half drained your veins, ye'll
remember, and ye'll need wait until they are replenished, eh."</p>
<p>"A week!" he groaned.</p>
<p>"Tut! 'Tis but a little while. Be thankful ye're not dead and
buried. And if ye've any friends with whom you'ld wish me to
communicate&mdash;</p>
<p>"No," said the Captain. "My friends can wait. It will be
better." Then, shifting the subject: "Sir," he said, "there is a
debt between us that it would tax my wit and my resources to
liquidate."</p>
<p>"It need not. Tut! No. What else could I have done? Carved you
up, as it was? Faith! every doctor is not a murderer, whatever the
vulgar may say Besides, ye're a more interesting experiment alive.
Tell me now, d'ye not actually remember hanging?"</p>
<p>"I do not," said the Captain.</p>
<p>The anatomist nodded. "Ay, ay; 'twas just so with John Smith
when he revived. Tell me what you remember."</p>
<p>Readily the Captain complied, relating those dream sensations
that had been his, and suppressing no more than the name of the
lady who had awaited him in the garden and in whose embrace he had
seemed to choke.</p>
<p>"A warning that," snapped Dr Blizzard, "a warning of the perils
that may lie in a woman's arms. Still, men will run the risk. Tut!
the pity of it!"</p>
<p>But the anatomist treasured those details of the Captain's
perilous passage through the gates of doom, and he incorporated
them in that memoir he prepared of the curious resurrection of
Captain Jenkyn, a memoir which&mdash;as I have said&mdash;has supplied me
with most of these particulars.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-17" id="ch-17"></a>Chapter 17. PAUNCEFORT THE
SOWER</h2>
<p>On the Monday of the following week&mdash;four days after the
execution of Captain Gaynor&mdash;came my Lord Pauncefort to Priory
Close for the first time since that encounter in the garden in
which his lordship had all but lost his life.</p>
<p>Of that encounter, too, Sir John was informed by now, and of the
intervention of the gardeners, which had saved Lord Pauncefort&mdash;an
intervention which Sir John deplored as profoundly as any of the
events of the past week. Indeed, but for that intervention Harry
Gaynor might still have been among the living, and the world would
have been the sweeter for being purged of a villain.</p>
<p>It was again in the library that the interview took place
between Sir John and his unwelcome visitor. The baronet's first
impulse had been to deny himself to his lordship. But he had
thought better of it, and had repaired to that lofty, book-lined
chamber where his visitor awaited him. Yet his greeting had been
sufficiently uncompromising.</p>
<p>"Do you not think, sir," he said, "that you have wrought evil
enough here already and that so you might have spared us this
intrusion upon the grief you have occasioned?"</p>
<p>His lordship, hat under arm, and leaning lightly upon his
amethyst-headed cane, had looked the very picture of injured
innocence.</p>
<p>"Sir John," he protested quietly, "assuredly you speak under a
grievous misapprehension."</p>
<p>"Is it a misapprehension that you delivered Captain Gaynor to
his death?"</p>
<p>"A gross one," cried his lordship instantly "Though I can see
upon what grounds you base it. I am the more glad I came since I
may now dispel your error. You have supposed, I see, that Harry
Gaynor's arrest was the result of his unfortunate quarrel with me
here. That is not so, sir. The warrant had been out some days
already, and he must have been taken when he was. And the real fact
is I came to warn him."</p>
<p>"To warn him that you had betrayed him?" Sir John's blue eyes
were hard and cold as they played over his lordship's handsome,
swarthy face, which flushed now under that regard.</p>
<p>"You use harsh words, sir, and untrue."</p>
<p>"In that you lie, my lord," answered the baronet. "Do you hear
me&mdash;you lie!"</p>
<p>His lordship stiffened. He drew himself up very rigid, and Sir
John watched him with eyes that gleamed almost wickedly:</p>
<p>"Were you twenty years younger, Sir John, I should ask you to
prove your words upon my body. But you are an old man," he added,
in tones that became a very insult of tolerance, his tall figure
relaxing its menacing rigidity, "and so I must even bear with you
and attempt to prove to you in more peaceful ways the ineffable
injustice of your words."</p>
<p>"Spare me more of this," flashed Sir John impatiently. "You may
disregard my insult on the score of my years, and I may lack the
means to force you to regard it&mdash;for you would swallow a blow even
as you swallow all else&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sir John!" the other cried, suddenly roused. "Do not urge me
too far or I may forget the years that lie between us."</p>
<p>"There is not the need. There are younger swords in plenty to
call a reckoning with you. What of O'Neill and Leigh, your sometime
friend, Harewood, Clinton, Brownrigg, and Mr Dyke, who is said to
play the deadliest sword in England? Have you bethought you what
will happen when presently these and the others you have betrayed
into gaol are restored to liberty?&mdash;as restored they must be for
lack of satisfactory grounds upon which to impeach them. Do you
think they will be slow to avenge upon you the base treachery you
performed in selling them? Or do you perhaps consider them in
ignorance or doubt of their betrayer?"</p>
<p>Ever since his encounter with Gaynor, Pauncefort had been
plagued by the thought of this; for Gaynor had made it more than
plain that his lordship's treachery was revealed, and it was odds
that what Gaynor knew was known to all the plotters. And yet it was
possible that it might not be; and, Gaynor being dead, his lordship
had clung to that possibility. As for Sir John, he was aware of the
source of the baronet's suspicions; he knew that they sprang from
the veiled threat he had uttered at their last meeting.</p>
<p>Slowly now he shook his head under its heavy black periwig. His
large eyes looked almost sorrowful.</p>
<p>"How sadly are you mistaken," said he. "As for those you name, I
cannot think they would so misjudge me. But if any should, he will
find me ready for him&mdash;ready to satisfy him in any manner he
desires. Meanwhile, however, Sir John, there is the business upon
which I am come."</p>
<p>"Ah, true!" snapped the baronet. "I detain you, no doubt. Pray
state this business. Thus shall I be the sooner rid of you."</p>
<p>"I bring you a warning," said his lordship.</p>
<p>"Such a warning, I make no doubt, as that which you bore Harry
Gaynor," was the stinging answer.</p>
<p>Lord Pauncefort considered him with those sorrowful eyes of his.
"Even so," he said quite simply. Then he sighed. "Indeed, I think
that I had better go my ways, leaving you to the fate that hangs
over you, since you have naught but insults for me. And yet, sir, I
will beg you to consider&mdash;since there is no other way of convincing
you of my good faith&mdash;that I can stand to gain little or nothing by
my warning to you, and," he added with slow emphasis, "that I might
gain a deal by your impeachment."</p>
<p>"You mistake," said Sir John, "I am in no danger of being
impeached."</p>
<p>"It is you who mistake, Sir John; for you are in danger, in
grave danger, not only of impeachment but of conviction. Against
those others whom you have named I gladly admit that the Government
can take no proceedings and will be forced to let them go for lack
of evidence, and also because such is the Government's policy. But
you, sir, are in far different case."</p>
<p>"I am," Sir John agreed, "because against me there is not even
the shadow of an accusation to be produced."</p>
<p>"Ah! You build on that" said his lordship sadly, and again he
shook his handsome head and sighed. "There is something you've
forgot. You have forgot that you harboured here one Harry Gaynor,
the notorious Jacobite agent and spy&mdash;I use the Government's
terms&mdash;who has been convicted and hanged."</p>
<p>It was quite true. If Sir John had not overlooked the fact
itself, at least he had overlooked the consequences it must have
for himself did the Government elect to move against him. It was a
matter to which he had never given thought, and finding it thrust
upon his notice thus abruptly by Lord Pauncefort, he perceived his
danger as clearly as one may perceive a chasm that has opened in
one's path.</p>
<p>He stood with hands clasped behind him, his tall, portly figure
somewhat bowed and his face suddenly troubled, all the fine
arrogance gone out of him. For there were not only the consequences
to himself to consider, there were the consequences to his wife and
child&mdash;the consideration of which had made him cautious to the
point of lukewarmness in his support of that Cause in which at
heart he believed. Were he convicted of treason&mdash;as it was very
clear now he might be&mdash;part of his punishment would be a fine that
must leave Lady Kynaston and Evelyn all but destitute.</p>
<p>A deep silence ensued. Sir John stood pondering with bowed head.
When at last he raised it, and his troubled glance once more rested
upon his visitor, Lord Pauncefort observed that his countenance was
ashen. But if there was no longer any arrogance in his bearing, it
was still in his tone and his uncompromising words.</p>
<p>"And it is of this that you are come to warn me?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Indeed, I would that were all," replied his lordship. "I am
come to tell you that my Lord Carteret has at present under
consideration the issuing of a warrant for your arrest upon that
charge."</p>
<p>Sir John smiled bitterly "Your information would serve, at
least, to resolve any doubt that might linger in my mind concerning
your own connection with the Government."</p>
<p>A shadow crossed his lordship's face, but he remained quite
unmoved.</p>
<p>"You persist in your opinion of me. It is so deepseated that all
things must serve to confirm it. But you are mistook, Sir John. My
information springs from my personal relations with the Secretary
of State, relations which have permitted me aforetime to serve my
friends, and which have permitted those&mdash;such as you, sir&mdash;who are
not my friends, to misconstrue my aims. I will add, sir, that in
your own case this warrant would already have been issued but for
the exertions which I have used with his lordship. I have played
upon his friendship for me by drawing his notice to the fact that I
must, myself, suffer by your arrest since I am hoping for the
honour of becoming related to you by marriage before long."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Sir John dryly. "I thought we should come to that in
the end!"</p>
<p>Pauncefort frowned. "The disinterestedness of my motives must be
so apparent, even to a mind prejudiced against me, that I marvel
you still remain in doubt, sir. You conceive, I fear, that I am
come to bargain with you. You expect me to say: 'Sanction my
wedding with your ward and niece, and my influence with my Lord
Carteret shall be employed, to obtain the suppression of this
warrant.' That is what you expect of me, is it not?"</p>
<p>"Some such proposal, I admit," answered the baronet, "though I
am sure you will cloak it in more specious terms."</p>
<p>His lordship stroked his cleft chin thoughtfully, and his eyes
narrowed as they surveyed Sir John.</p>
<p>"Let me," he said very gently, "let me beg you to observe, Sir
John, that to serve such aims as you impute to me, I need in this
matter but to stand aside and suffer the warrant to be executed.
Nay, more: Were I first and last the self-seeker you account me and
do not scruple to pronounce me, I should be employing such
influence as I have with the Secretary of State to urge the
warrant's instant execution. For reflect, I beg, that upon your
inevitable conviction of treason must follow your outlawry. The
powers conferred upon you by the will of the late Mr Hollinstone
will be determined; you will no longer have any voice at law in any
matter whatsoever, and for sanction to my union with your ward may
be dispensed with, for it is a thing you will have power neither to
confer nor to withhold. That, Sir John, is a reflection which may
lead you to judge me in a spirit of some justice."</p>
<p>But Sir John did not seem at all disposed to do so,
notwithstanding that he perceived the irrefragable fact to which
his lordship drew his attention.</p>
<p>"I see," he said slowly. "I see! What you have to propose then
is that subject to my giving my sanction you will so exercise your
influence with my Lord Carteret as to achieve the suppression of
the warrant, eh? And thus&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Not so," Pauncefort interrupted, loud and imperiously. "I make
no bargain. I have nothing to propose. I merely desire to indicate
that by serving me you will best serve yourself. In any event my
efforts can never be addressed to any end but that of saving you
from your impending fate&mdash;and this, notwithstanding the insults you
have heaped upon me now. But those efforts, which would be almost
certain of success if exerted by one who is become your relative,
are almost equally certain of failure coming from one who is no
more than your friend."</p>
<p>The impudence of it struck Sir John speechless for a moment. He
found in it matter for laughter almost, despite the overwhelming
peril at which his heart was sickening.</p>
<p>"My friend?" he said, and his lip curled ominously. "Too great
an honour." And he bowed ironically. "And there is one trifle that
has escaped your attention, too, in this. You have forgot to
consider Miss Hollinstone herself and her inclinations."</p>
<p>His lordship was on the point of answering that those
inclinations might easily be swayed when she knew of Sir John's
peril. But from that false step he saved himself betimes. He was
none of your clumsy, superficial intriguers, but one who went to
work skilfully in the depths. He contained himself and bowed, his
face wearing an expression of concern and sorrow.</p>
<p>"It is true," he said. "I have not sufficiently considered how
those inclinations will have been swayed against me in a household
so permeated by a spirit hostile to myself&mdash;in a household where,
despite all that I can protest and all that I can do, I am looked
upon as a man who has not kept faith. It is monstrously unjust; but
it seems there is naught I can do to combat it."</p>
<p>Suspicious of this half-resignation, Sir John eyed his visitor
shrewdly.</p>
<p>"You betrayed yourself to her, my lord, in this very room," he
answered slowly. "You betrayed the true fortune-hunting motives by
which you were animated. Can you wonder that she looks upon you now
with&mdash;with the contempt you merit?"</p>
<p>His lordship sighed. He dabbed his red lips with a flimsy
kerchief ere he answered. Then he shrugged despondently.</p>
<p>"I was mad that day," he said. "That infamous money-lender,
Israel Suarez, had been almost violent, and I was driven to the
verge of despair. But, Sir John, if I showed myself eager for
control of your ward's fortune, it was not thence to be construed
that I was not eager for herself, that I did not love her for
herself." He turned his large, handsome eyes upon the baronet. They
were heavy with sorrow. "I would give my life to efface that hour,"
he said.</p>
<p>"Do so, then," said Sir John, "and perhaps you will efface it.
If not, being dead, it will signify less to you. You will cease to
suffer."</p>
<p>"You rally me, sir!" was the indignant cry.</p>
<p>"Neither yourself nor the Government," said Sir John, "can
deprive me of the right to laugh. Soon it may be the only right
remaining me."</p>
<p>His lordship took up his hat from the table, tucked it under his
arm, and drew on his heavy riding-gloves. His face was set, his
lips tight-pressed. But all this was purest comedy. He realised
that he had said all that need be said. He had sowed his seeds, and
it were well now to depart without further disturbing the soil,
leaving those same seeds to sink in. He was fairly sanguine that
they would put forth roots ere long. And, meanwhile, as some
recompense for his services and some compensation for the injustice
done him in the case of Harry Gaynor, Lord Carteret was willing to
delay Sir John's arrest until Pauncefort should give the word. So
that there was no desperate haste.</p>
<p>"In spite of all, Sir John," he said, "I cannot forget that for
a season we were good friends."</p>
<p>"My memory is not so good as yours," quoth the downright,
uncompromising baronet.</p>
<p>"So I perceive," said the viscount, smiling bitterly. "Mine is
not only long, but grateful. And so, despite the unworthy manner in
which you have used me today, I shall continue to strain every
effort with my Lord Carteret to procure your immunity from the
consequences of your meddling with treason."</p>
<p>Sir John strode to the bell-rope, and tugged it with a violent
hand.</p>
<p>"I should loathe to be beholden to you," he said. "Pray leave my
affairs to care for themselves."</p>
<p>"I understand, Sir John," replied the other, with a resumption
of his air of resignation. "Oh, I understand." Then he bowed
stiffly. "I have the honour to give you good day."</p>
<p>Sir John waved a hand in almost contemptuous dismissal. A
footman, summoned by the bell, stood in the doorway. "Reconduct his
lordship," said the baronet shortly.</p>
<p>But once alone, his manner changed as abruptly as if he had
thrown off a cloak in which he had been wrapped. He walked heavily
to the writing-table, sank into the chair, leaned his head upon his
hand and stared dully into vacancy Then something that was almost a
sob shook his massive, vigorous frame.</p>
<p>"My poor Maria!" he groaned aloud. "My poor Evelyn! God help you
both!"</p>
<p>But he had been wiser if, instead of groaning impotently there,
he had retained awhile his cloak of defiant self-possession, and
himself escorted my Lord Pauncefort to the chaise which awaited him
in the avenue. Thus might he have averted the ill-chance which came
to serve his lordship. For as Pauncefort was descending the steps,
he encountered Miss Kynaston herself.</p>
<p>He paused a moment to give her greeting. His air was gloomy and
preoccupied. But what engaged him now was a new thought that had
flashed into his opportunist mind. True, he had accounted ample the
seed he had sown; and yet he knew that Sir John could be very
obstinate, that he might immolate himself out of that obstinacy
upon the altar of what he accounted a sacred trust from the dead.
There could be no harm his lordship opined, in sowing a little more
seed in this very pretty and fertile soil so opportunely thrust
before him.</p>
<p>"Alas, Miss Kynaston, I fear that I have been the bearer of but
indifferent tidings to your father," he said, and the gloom of his
face was most tragically deepened.</p>
<p>It alarmed her, as that subtle gentleman intended that it
should. He noted the flutter of colour in her cheeks, the startled
look in her eyes.</p>
<p>"What is it?" she asked him a little breathlessly</p>
<p>He glanced aside at the footman who stood by the door. She read
the look, and understood his meaning when he invited her to walk
the length of the avenue with him.</p>
<p>"Drive on," he bade his coachman. "Stay for me at the
gates."</p>
<p>Down the avenue of elms, in the dappled shade, stepped dainty
Evelyn beside his handsome lordship.</p>
<p>"It is well, perhaps, that I should tell you," he was saying
musingly, "most opportune, indeed, that I should have met you. You
may be able to accomplish something in which I greatly fear me that
I have failed, and in which my failure involved your father in
grave peril."</p>
<p>Piqued, alarmed, flattered by the suggestion that she might
achieve something in which he had failed, Evelyn's sweetly timid
eyes fluttered him an upward glance of inquiry.</p>
<p>"Your father, madam, has involved himself very seriously by
having harboured here one who has been convicted and hanged as a
traitor and spy: Such an action subjects a man to penalties
scarcely less grave than those imposed upon the actual traitor,
because in itself such an action implies an almost equal degree of
guilt."</p>
<p>"What do you tell me?" she cried, now all alarm.</p>
<p>"The brutal truth, ma'am. But there is not yet the need for
alarm. What friend can do I am doing to obtain the suppression of
the warrant which the Secretary of State has already signed for
your father's arrest."</p>
<p>"For his arrest!" She stood still, one hand clutching his
lordship's sleeve, and her lovely empty face was blenched.</p>
<p>"Nay, now, nay!" he soothed her. "I entreat ye, ma'am, do not
give way: I am hopeful that I may prevail. I have much influence
with my Lord Carteret; he listens to me, and you may be sure that
all such influence shall be employed to serve you."</p>
<p>"What&mdash;what could they do to him if he were arrested?" she
asked.</p>
<p>"Ah!" he said, and rubbed his chin. "They would hardly hang him,
I think. No, no, there is no danger of that. But they will mulct
him very heavily&mdash;so heavily that it may almost amount to a
complete confiscation of his estates and possessions."</p>
<p>A vista of poverty, of destitution, was instantly opened out
before the eyes of her imagination. It terrified her, for all that
the picture was far from lifelike. She had looked upon so few of
the realities of life that she was incapable of adequately
conceiving this one. But she conceived enough of it to undergo
almost an increase of terror.</p>
<p>"Oh!" she moaned, and again: "Oh!"</p>
<p>"But you are not to be alarmed," he repeated. "Oddslife, now,
did I not say that I would exert my influence, and that my
influence is great? Bear that in mind to set against your fears."
He spoke cheerfully and confidently, and, reflective as she always
was, she felt herself cheered and her confidence returning. Then
his face clouded. "If," he ran on, "your father had but chosen the
way I showed him, I could make his immunity a certainty.
Unfortunately&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What way was that?" she questioned eagerly.</p>
<p>He looked down at this frail slip of womanhood, observed the
elegantly coiffed golden head that scarce reached the level of his
shoulder, and he sighed.</p>
<p>"As you know," he said, "I am betrothed to Damaris."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," said she, for even now she had not learnt of the
grounds upon which that betrothal had been dissolved. The readiness
of the "yes, yes" informed him of this fact, and made things easier
for him. His eyes glowed a moment with satisfaction.</p>
<p>"You may not know that your father is opposed to the marriage;
that he will not allow it to take place until Damaris is of full
age."</p>
<p>"But why?" she cried.</p>
<p>"Some trifling scruple of adherence to her father's wishes," he
answered lightly. "This scruple I have begged him to put aside. I
have assured him that were I his relative, instead of his friend,
it would strengthen my hands to serve him, it would render Lord
Carteret's suppression of the warrant certain. For, you see, madam,
he loves me too well to wish to hurt any who might stand in a
degree of relationship, however slender, towards myself."</p>
<p>"Then&mdash;then it is easy. He is safe, and there is not any cause
for fear," she exclaimed, and her face was upturned to his.</p>
<p>He gloomed down at her sorrowfully, and shook his head.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, your father will not waive his idle scruples,"
he said. Then he brightened again. "But do not let it concern you.
After all, I do not doubt but that I shall be able to prevail even
as it is. Still, the other way would be safer. But I dare not press
your father on the point; nor yet dare I press Damaris,
because&mdash;This is a confidence that you'll respect, Miss
Kynaston?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," she assured him eagerly.</p>
<p>"Because," he resumed, "Damaris once did me the injustice to
think that I wooed her out of mercenary motives, and I could not
for all the world give her cause to think so again."</p>
<p>"How could she in this?" cried simple Evelyn.</p>
<p>He smiled the bitter, knowing smile of the man of the world, of
the man who has looked into the human heart and studied its
proneness to unworthy suspicions.</p>
<p>"It might be construed that I sought to make a bargain, and I
could not suffer that. Therefore, I may not insist. Perhaps,
indeed, I have failed to represent to your father the full extent
of your peril. If I tell it you, it is because, thinking highly as
I do of&mdash;of your wit, you may perhaps consider well to give a hint
in the proper quarter. But do not on any account say that I urged
it, and&mdash;and perhaps you had best say naught to your father."</p>
<p>It was as plain an invitation to tell Damaris as he could well
have uttered; yet she did not perceive his subtleties.</p>
<p>"I understand," she cried. "Oh yes, I will do what I can."</p>
<p>"I am sure of it, and thus you will bring me the happiness of
having served not only your father, but yourself&mdash;for it involves
your own future as well!" Doffing his three-cornered hat, he bowed
low over her hand. He kissed it in farewell, and also, as it were,
to seal a bond between them.</p>
<p>They had reached the chaise by now. He entered it, whilst she
stood by the gate-post watching him, somewhat bemused by all that
he had said. The coachman gathered up his reins, when suddenly his
lordship checked him. He thrust his head from the carriage
window.</p>
<p>"Upon second thoughts, Miss Kynaston, perhaps it were best if
you said naught to anyone. Leave the matter in my hands to deal
with as best I can. I&mdash;" he faltered, and shrugged his shoulders
helplessly. "I so dread the danger of unworthy motives being
imputed to me. So best forget what I have said."</p>
<p>Again he gravely saluted her, and without waiting for an answer
he sank back into his chaise. But as the carriage rolled away he
smiled, well satisfied to reflect that his meeting her had been a
most fortunate chance, and that he had sowed more than he had
looked to do when he came, and some of it on very fertile soil.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-18" id="ch-18"></a>Chapter 18. IN CHECK</h2>
<p>As my Lord Pauncefort calculated so did things fall out. No
sooner had she seen his carriage roll away in a cloud of dust
towards London than Evelyn went in quest of Damaris.</p>
<p>She found her seated by the window of her room&mdash;she would sit
there by the hour now in apparent idleness&mdash;and in her hand Damaris
held Captain Gaynor's letter, which already she had read so often
that its every character was seared indelibly upon her memory. She
thrust the epistle into the bosom of her corsage when Evelyn
entered, still pale and breathless now from the haste she had made,
and she listened quite calmly to the tale that Evelyn brought.</p>
<p>At the mention of Sir John's danger her gentle face had hardened
and she had frowned. Her quick mind perceived it instantly.
Whatever else might be false in the message of which her cousin was
the bearer, there could be no question as to the truth of that part
of it. Yet she remained singularly quiet.</p>
<p>"I see," she said, when Evelyn had done. "And of course Lord
Pauncefort bade you tell me this." The faint sneer gave the words
their intended meaning, and Evelyn grasped it instantly.</p>
<p>"Not so," she cried, her cheeks flushing with indignation for
one whom she felt it her duty&mdash;since he had so openly and honestly
confided in her&mdash;to champion. "Not so&mdash;though he feared that you
would think so."</p>
<p>"Then, of course, he did intend that you should tell me."</p>
<p>"He did not!" Evelyn stamped her foot. She was angry now.</p>
<p>"Why all this heat, my dear?"</p>
<p>"Because you are so unjust, so meanly suspicious. And you go too
fast in your suspicions. It was just because he feared that you
might impute unworthy motives to him that he begged me as he was
setting out to forget all that he had said and to mention it to no
one."</p>
<p>"Being quite confident, of course, that you could not keep it to
yourself," said Damaris. "Nay, Evelyn, be not angry with me. My
scorn is not for you, child."</p>
<p>"I am as old as you are," flashed Evelyn back, with something of
her mothers irrelevance.</p>
<p>"But you have been saved some of the bitter experience which has
been mine," added Damaris, with a pale smile, "else my Lord
Pauncefort would not so easily have made a tool of you."</p>
<p>"A tool of me? Lord Pauncefort?" Her indignation was out of all
proportion to the charge. For she magnified it into an insult&mdash;a
slight upon her shrewdness.</p>
<p>"Do you not see, Evelyn dear, that if he had no ends to serve by
telling you this, he would not needlessly have harassed you by
showing you your father's peril? It is precisely because he sought
to strike a bargain with Sir John, and because Sir John failed him
entirely, that he sent me this message by you."</p>
<p>"He sent no message," Evelyn insisted. "'Tis hateful to be so
suspicious. He told me not to mention what he had said, just
because he feared you would so construe his ends."</p>
<p>"That fear, at least, was shrewd in him."</p>
<p>"I see that it is idle to make you understand." And on that,
with flaming cheeks, Eveyln swung on her heel and left her
cousin.</p>
<p>To have been told that Lord Pauncefort had made a tool of her,
as though she had no wit of her own! It was monstrous, and it sent
her very angry to her chamber. Had she known in what frame of mind
she left poor Damaris, perhaps her own had been less bitter.</p>
<p>To the burden, already almost overwhelming, of her grief was
added this fresh horror&mdash;the knowledge that over her only remaining
friend hung this terrible peril in which his very life might be
involved, and the further torturing, agonising knowledge that it
lay within her power, by self-immolation, to rescue him.</p>
<p>She rose, and remained standing for some time by the window, her
hands pressed against her brow, as if seeking to stimulate the
numbed brain within. Did it greatly matter what befell her now? Did
it greatly matter that she should deliver herself to Pauncefort as
a ransom for Sir John? Was it not, perhaps, the best use to which
she could now devote her otherwise wasted and useless life?</p>
<p>Heavy-footed she went below in quest of her guardian. She found
him still seated at the table in the library, bowed down in
expectation of the descent of that impending sword. He looked up as
she entered, and the sight of that grey face, and the dumb pain
investing those eyes that were wont to gleam so clear and jovially,
strengthened her in her purpose by showing her the great good to be
achieved.</p>
<p>She came to him, and set an arm about his shoulder, her smooth
warm cheek against his own.</p>
<p>"Father dear," she murmured&mdash;and since it was not her custom to
address him by that name, her present use of it lent her a greater
tenderness. "Father dear, you are troubled, and I have come to help
you if you will let me."</p>
<p>"Trou&mdash;troubled!" he faltered, with a poor attempt to bluster.
"Nay, now, what should be troubling me?"</p>
<p>"This thing that my Lord Pauncefort came to tell you. You see
that I know all."</p>
<p>He attempted to swing round in her embrace that he might face
her.</p>
<p>"Who told you?" he growled. "Did you see Pauncefort? Did he make
you this infamous proposal?"</p>
<p>"No," she answered. "He saw Evelyn."</p>
<p>"And he told her to the end that she might tell you!" His voice
was shaking now with indignation.</p>
<p>"Be not angry with her, father dear." Her cheek pressed his own
yet more closely. "Evelyn is but a child. She never realised that
my Lord Pauncefort used her to this end. I do not think that she
fully realises your danger even now."</p>
<p>"Indeed," he answered bitterly, "it is well written that the
father of a fool hath no joy." For in his mind at that moment was
the fact that his child, informed of this horror that menaced him,
had never given a thought to the condition in which it must have
left him, had never attempted to seek him out, to bring him at
least the comfort of her affection and sympathy. It had been left
for Damaris to discharge a consoler's duty, and more, to seek him
with the offer to immolate herself that she might rescue him&mdash;for
already he guessed, with heavy foreboding, the nature of the help
which she announced.</p>
<p>It must be as Damaris said. It must be that this frivolous,
irresponsible child he had brought into the world had not the wit
to understand his position. He sighed heavily as he reflected that
she was, after all, his offspring&mdash;his and his foolish wife's&mdash;and
that he had not the right to complain.</p>
<p>"Do not grieve, my sweet Damaris," he said presently. "Your
sympathy has consoled and cheered me. It makes me realise that
perhaps all may not yet be lost."</p>
<p>"Nothing is lost," she answered him, "since we have it in our
power to&mdash;to ransom you."</p>
<p>"Not that!" he cried, in a voice of thunder. "I forbid it. Do
you hear me, child?" He disengaged himself from her arms, and threw
back his great head that he might regard her fully. Then in a
milder, tender voice, he pursued: "Ah, it is sweet in you to offer
it; it is noble in you, and I am proud and happy in this earnest of
your love, my dear. But it may not&mdash;it shall not be."</p>
<p>"I am but a husk," she said slowly, her voice a little wistful,
her eyes resolute. "All that was Damaris Hollinstone perished at
Tyburn a week ago&mdash;all save this little of me that I have kept for
you. What, then, can it signify? Let my lord have this husk. It is
all that he seeks of me&mdash;more than he seeks, since my fortune is
his real desire. And how better could that fortune be applied than
to ransoming the man whom today I honour most in all the world. Ah,
father dear, you'll not deny me. Did you know how gladly I
will&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No!" he roared again, and his great hand crashed heavily upon
the table. "It shall not be. I would not permit it were it to save
me from being quartered alive. What manner of knave should I be,
Damaris? What respect for me could linger with you or with any
honest soul did I become a party to so infamous a bargain?" He
waved a hand of peremptory dismissal. "Let come what will. I am am
old man, and in any event I should not have many more years of life
before me. The Government will get but little, when all is said,
and for such a little the ransom you propose were altogether absurd
and disproportionate."</p>
<p>"Can it be that you think only of yourself?" she asked him.</p>
<p>He stared. "My dear, I hope I think of you as well."</p>
<p>"There are those who have a prior claim to mine upon your
thoughts."</p>
<p>She saw the sudden spasm of pain that crossed his face; noted
the little pause before he spoke again. But when he did speak his
tone and manner were unshaken.</p>
<p>"And am I so base that I will purchase their welfare at the
price of your prostitution?" he asked her.</p>
<p>But she did not flinch. "I have told you that I am but a husk,"
she said. "Do you not believe me?"</p>
<p>"O my God!" he groaned, and for a moment he was limp and
helpless. But in the next he had mastered himself. "Not another
word of this, my child," he said, and his voice was now one of
utter finality. "As you love me do not attempt to pursue this
subject further. I will not listen. Ah, don't think me harsh, don't
think me slow to perceive your nobility, your greatness, my sweet
Damaris." He rose, took her in his arms, and kissed her very
tenderly. "For that I thank you from my soul. You have brought such
comfort and gladness to my grey hairs this day as I have never
known. To the end I shall thank God for the treasure of your
affection."</p>
<p>"Ah, but, father dear!" Her face was upturned to his, and he saw
the tears brimming her eyes.</p>
<p>"No more," he said gently. "No more of this. You cannot
constrain me, for even if you consented of your own accord to the
sacrifice, even did you in your foolish nobility seek that hound
Pauncefort and announce your readiness to pay the price, yet should
I withhold my consent to the union, and exercise my rights under
your father's will. I must, as I believe in God and in honour."</p>
<p>She perceived then how irrefragable was his resolve, perceived
with her true-sightedness that did she urge him further he might
perhaps make an end by impaling himself upon the sword that
threatened him. So she went her way, praying heaven to afford her
the means of saving him yet, despite himself. Indeed, so engrossed
was she in the thought that she realised but indifferently its
meaning to herself, had little leisure in which to dwell upon the
horror of the price that she must pay.</p>
<p>One day, a week later, she thought that her chance had come,
when Evelyn brought her word that my Lord Pauncefort was again
closeted with Sir John in the library.</p>
<p>Again as on the occasion of my lord's previous visit, Sir John's
first impulse had been to deny himself. But he reflected that it
were best to receive his lordship and learn&mdash;as he supposed he
would&mdash;the precise present degree of the danger threatened. Yet his
reception of Pauncefort was again as uncompromising as before.</p>
<p>"You are not welcome, my lord," he said, rising to receive his
visitor, and keeping him standing throughout the interview, "and if
your visit has the same object as your last you had been better
advised to have spared yourself the trouble."</p>
<p>"I deplore, Sir John," returned the viscount, with his almost
miraculous equanimity, "to find you still in the same obdurate
humour. But I think I shall have the felicity of mending it." He
advanced slowly, gracefully into the room, whilst Sir John took his
habitual stand with his shoulders to the carved overmantel. "Had I
not conceived," he continued, "means of removing your unworthy
suspicions, of proving to you how disinterested is my action, how
dictated purely by my profound affection for your ward I should not
again have intruded where&mdash;as you do not omit to tell me&mdash;I am
unwelcome."</p>
<p>He had waited from hour to hour in London, confident that there
would come to him a letter from Damaris. Unable, however, longer to
endure the suspense; knowing, too, that he could not much longer
delay action in the matter of advising Sir John's arrest, lest it
should occur independently to Lord Carteret to order it (from which
will be gathered the falsehood in which his lordship had been
dealing), he had returned to the attack, armed now with a fresh
weapon.</p>
<p>"I am listening, my lord," was the baronet's cold answer. "But I
warn you that the matter will need a deal of proof, and I conceive
that your invention is more like to be strained than my credulity.
But proceed, my lord."</p>
<p>"You have said, sir, that to the end you would withhold your
sanction to my marriage with your niece?" His lordship's statement
was interrogative rather than affirmative.</p>
<p>"I have said so," answered Sir John.</p>
<p>"And I hope," said his lordship, "that you adhere to that
resolve."</p>
<p>"You are justified of that hope, at least," was the dry
answer.</p>
<p>The door opened gently and, unobserved by either of the men,
Damaris appeared under the lintel.</p>
<p>"I rejoice in that," answered his lordship, his face lightening
suddenly, "since thus I can prove to yourself and to Damaris my
penitence of my past attitude and the sincerity of my feelings. I
am willing, Sir John, willing and eager to marry your niece, as you
once invited me, without your sanction. And so, the devil take her
fortune!"</p>
<p>"And the devil take your offer!" was the imperturbable
reply.</p>
<p>"No, no, Sir John!" It was Damaris who spoke. She advanced
quietly into the room.</p>
<p>"Damaris!" cried Sir John, and his brows grew dark. His
lordship, a fine figure in bronze-green satin, bowed until the
curls of his periwig almost met across his face.</p>
<p>"Since his lordship offers this proof of his sincerity&mdash;" she
began, and Lord Pauncefort's eyes were aglow with triumph. But this
triumph was not yet complete.</p>
<p>"His sincerity!" the baronet interrupted. "Are you deceived by
these smooth words?"</p>
<p>"Sir John, you go too far," my lord reproved him, very haughty
now. "Consider, pray, that I do no more than take you at your word,
as I should have taken you when it was uttered but that I was a
fool. Thus, at least, I had saved Damaris and myself much fruitless
pain. I am here, sir, to repair a fault for which I have never
ceased to feel the most profound contrition, and if there is
deception in my words I challenge you, sir, to unmask it."</p>
<p>He flicked a handkerchief as he finished, applied it to his
lips, and with head thrown back, gallant defiance in every line of
him, he waited for Sir John's answer. It came hard and swift.</p>
<p>"Why, what a foolish rogue is this! It passes belief! That he
should think, Damaris, to cozen us with transparent falsehoods that
would not deceive a child! And you would listen to him. Be it so;
but at least let me help you to understand him. He will take you
without my sanction, he says; by which he means that he will take
you without your fortune, and that in withholding my sanction I am
to dispose of your inheritance as your father's will directs. But
am I? Shall I be allowed to do so? If they arrest me and make an
outlaw of me, what power have I to execute any such deed? And that,
Damaris, is what my lord is counting on. Oh, he is subtle but not
subtle enough to match his villainy."</p>
<p>Lord Pauncefort's face was black with anger. "Your injustice,
sir, is the only thing that passes belief." He swung to Damaris. "I
am employing every effort of which I am capable to restrain the
Secretary of State from issuing a warrant against your uncle as I
have told him; and all that he can find for me on his side is
insult. I think I had much better wash my hands of the affair, and
leave him to his fate."</p>
<p>"No, no!" she cried. "Wait, my lord. Do you undertake that Sir
John shall have complete immunity from any proceedings?"</p>
<p>"From any proceedings resulting from his having harboured
Captain Gaynor," said his lordship. "That is what I have promised.
I do not wish this to be a bargain between us, Damaris. In no sense
do I make it a bargain. But loving you as I do," he continued,
affecting not to observe how she winced under those words, "loving
you as I do, how can I refrain from pointing out that, were I Sir
John's relative by marriage, my Lord Carteret, out of his affection
for me, would be more easily induced to refrain from proceedings
against him? This I can promise."</p>
<p>"Ay, and prove as false to your promise as you have proven false
to all else," stormed Sir John. "Oh, do not heed him, Damaris."</p>
<p>"Nay, you must heed me, mistress," said his lordship. "You were
right to&mdash;to have despised me once for an altogether unworthy
hesitation. That hesitation I am now amending, and I implore you
not to make me suffer more for it than I have done. I am ready and
eager, as I have said, to waive Sir John's sanction, and thus
consent that your fortune be bestowed elsewhere. What greater proof
can I afford of the sincerity of my intentions?"</p>
<p>"He waives my sanction," said Sir John, "knowing full well that
once I am laid by the heels he can dispense with it at law to
appropriate your inheritance. Do you not see, Damaris, that, far
from helping me, as you suppose, by such a sacrifice, you will but
imperil me, you will make my doom doubly assured?"</p>
<p>This was checkmate indeed; and his lordship saw it&mdash;saw it
reflected on her face. Her shrewd wit had straightly followed Sir
John's shrewd indication.</p>
<p>"Then you must give your sanction, Sir John," she cried. "You
must!"</p>
<p>"Never!" he answered, and his lips closed firmly, his face
became a stone.</p>
<p>Lord Pauncefort perceived the doom of his hope as far as the
present line of attack was concerned. But from her attitude he
perceived where and how a flanking movement might be made that
should carry him to easy victory. At once he flung off his
hypocritical mask of resignation, and showed now a countenance that
was evil and menacing.</p>
<p>He bowed. "There is no more to be said at present," he murmured.
"You are too old a man to call to account for your words. It but
remains for me to withdraw from further insult."</p>
<p>As on the former occasion Sir John pulled the bell-rope. "I am
glad, sir, that you perceive it," was his scornful answer.</p>
<p>Deliberately his lordship turned his shoulders upon him, and
with bowed head he stood respectfully before Damaris.</p>
<p>"I will beg you to judge more mercifully than does your uncle.
Believe me," and his voice vibrated with an apparent sincerity that
almost deceived her, "I have not deserved so much opprobrium, and I
am honest in my love of you."</p>
<p>He swept her a profound bow, and was gone.</p>
<p>She ran to Sir John, and put her arms about his neck. "Why did
you refuse?" she wailed. "You have doomed yourself."</p>
<p>"Not more than I was doomed before," he answered gloomily. He
stroked the dark head, and looked wistfully into her brown eyes,
that were now so troubled for his sake. "Indeed, my only chance is
to stand firm," he said, to comfort her. "If I give way I am
destroyed. But as long as I refuse him, I may hold him off; he may
hope and, hoping, may not denounce me&mdash;for it is upon his
denunciation that my arrest depends. The rest is all a fable of his
own. He has convinced me of that today."</p>
<p>"Oh no, no; never that!" she cried.</p>
<p>"I know my Lord Carteret. We have been almost friends. And I
know that he is not the man to stand like a lackey at that fellow's
beck. Pish! It is as I say. He pretends to stand between me and
arrest. He does&mdash;by not denouncing me. He denounced all the others.
He denounced Harry Gaynor."</p>
<p>She cried out at that. It was a shrewd thrust, well calculated
to pierce her armour of self-sacrifice, as Sir John intended.</p>
<p>"Ay, it is true enough, as God hears me," he insisted. "And that
is the man you would have married! You see how impossible 'twould
be? You had not quite understood this until now, eh? But do not
fret, dear child. By opposing him we may still weather this." She
was deceived. "You believe that?"</p>
<p>"I do," he answered, lying bravely And so, somewhat comforted by
his assurance, she departed.</p>
<p>But when alone he went again to sit at that table, as he had sat
before after the last interview with Lord Pauncefort. And if on
that occasion he had accounted himself in grave danger, today he
accounted himself irrevocably doomed. The end would not be long in
coming, and he wondered again what would betide his helpless child,
and still more helpless wife, when the blow fell. From his heart he
sent up a silent prayer to God to guard them.</p>
<p>Still sitting there, quite idly, a lackey found him half an hour
later when he entered with a letter for Sir John, which a messenger
had just brought from London.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-19" id="ch-19"></a>Chapter 19. THE CAPTAIN GOES
INTO ACTION</h2>
<p>Sir John broke the seal, and spread a sheet of yellowish paper
on which a crabbed and spidery hand had written:</p>
<blockquote>HONOURED SIR,&mdash;I have a communication to make that I
think you will consider of importance, concerning your friend
Captain Harry Gaynor, and as I am in some haste to deliver it,
which you will consider quite natural when you shall have received
it, I hope that you will find it possible to do me the honour of
visiting me here at once. The bearer of these present has my order
to reconduct you hither should you desire to give my request the
immediate compliance which I solicit. Should this not be possible
or convenient, he is to bring me word on what day and at what hour
I may look for the honour of your visit. My house is situate in the
Gray's Inn Road, three doors from 'The Weeping Woman,' as you go
from Holborn. I am, honoured sir, your obedient, respectful
servant, EMANUEL BLIZZARD.</blockquote>
<p>Sir John read the letter twice with knitted brows. A
communication concerning Harry Gaynor! And the writer did not so
much as say "the late Harry Gaynor." It flashed through his mind at
the first reading that here might lurk some trap for him. But that
omission of "the late"&mdash;with its inevitable suggestion that the
writer was in ignorance of the Captain's death&mdash;was in itself
almost sufficient to dispel any such fear. Assuredly, anyone
preparing a snare for him would not have fallen into such an
omission as that. A doubt still lingered. But he crushed it aside.
What need was there to lay traps for him? If his conviction was
desired, the grounds already afforded were ample.</p>
<p>He rose abruptly, his decision taken. He could form no
conception of the nature of this promised communication, seek as he
might; but it could not be his to be slow to inform himself. He
looked at the respectfully waiting servant.</p>
<p>"What like is the messenger who brought this?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"Just a plain youth, Sir John," the man replied. "He came on
horseback."</p>
<p>"Tell him I will accompany him. Bid them saddle Jessie for me,
and send Bird to help me on with my boots."</p>
<p>He said nothing to Damaris, and to his wife no more than that he
was summoned to London upon a matter of some urgency and that he
would return that night.</p>
<p>A couple of hours later he was standing in a dark room on the
ground floor of the doctor's dingy house in the Gray's Inn Road.
Into this room came the slim little professor, moving swiftly and
jerkily, as was his habit, and clucking as he came.</p>
<p>"Tut, tut! This is kind in you, Sir John. I should be distressed
to think I had caused you inconvenience, eh? I trust I have not."
He washed his great bony hands in the air, his gimlet eyes gleaming
through his spectacles.</p>
<p>"I should not consider any inconvenience of account to receive a
communication touching one who was almost as a son to me, Mr
Blizzard."</p>
<p>"Doctor&mdash;Doctor Blizzard," the professor amended. "Your obedient
servant. But, will you not sit, eh?"</p>
<p>Sir John took the arm-chair to which the doctor waved him, and
set his hat and whip on the table at his side. The professor leaned
against the table, clucking for a moment. He thrust his spectacles
up on to his forehead until they almost joined the rim of his
grizzled bob-wig, and he peered at his visitor with short-sighted
eyes that had lost all apparent powers of penetration.</p>
<p>"The communication I have for you, sir, is very
extraordinary&mdash;ve-ry extraordinary, eh; in fact, startling."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," said the baronet. "I will beg you not to prolong my
suspense."</p>
<p>"Tut! I should not dream of it. But it may be necessary to
prepare you somewhat, eh?"</p>
<p>"To prepare me?"</p>
<p>"Godso! yes. Have I not said that my communication is of a
startling character, eh? It amounts, sir, to this: that the gallows
at Tyburn proved to your friend the gate of life in a sense other
than that intended by the prophet, psalmist or theologian, or
whoever it was, who made the phrase&mdash;<i>mors janua vitae</i>, ye
know."</p>
<p>Sir John stared at him blankly. Had he to do with a madman?
"Will ye tell me Dr Blizzard, in plain terms, what ye mean?"</p>
<p>"In plain terms? Ah! In plain terms, then ... But wait! I am a
doctor, as I have told you, sir. I am a professor of anatomy, and
therefore a student of anatomy. By great good fortune, sir, your
friend's friends neglected to provide a funeral for him, and I
bought the alleged corpse from the snatchers for a couple o'
guineas, and&mdash;well, then, to put it in plain terms, as ye desire, I
found that he wasn't dead at all."</p>
<p>Sir John sat very still. Slowly the colour faded from his face.
His lips parted, but he made no sound. Then he began to tremble
from head to foot.</p>
<p>"There, there! Tut, tut!" cried the doctor, slipping his
spectacles once more on to his nose, and observing his visitor. "I
told you 'twould startle you. Ye would have it in plain terms."</p>
<p>"I..." The baronet gulped. "I am quite myself, sir," he said,
striving valiantly to master his agitation. He drew out a
handkerchief, and mopped his clammy brow. "But I confess you
startled me. In fact, I hardly understand you even now. Do you mean
that Harry Gaynor is&mdash;is alive?"</p>
<p>"Not only alive, but almost well. Mending rapidly. In a day or
two he will be in case to go his ways again."</p>
<p>There followed a silence which the professor did not attempt to
interrupt. He understood that such news as this must be given time
for assimilation by any ordinary brain.</p>
<p>"But this is a miracle!" cried Sir John presently, yet he spoke
without heartiness. Obviously he was still incredulous; obviously
he still but half understood the thing he had been told.</p>
<p>"Tut!" clucked the professor. "There are no miracles in nature.
A miracle is a thing out of nature; and the thing I tell you is a
thing in nature. Sufficiently rare to look like a miracle; but no
miracle at all.</p>
<p>"Where is he?" was Sir John's next question, his voice
trembling.</p>
<p>"Above stairs, awaiting you," was the answer, and it was an
answer that seemed to dispel at last the mists that were
obfuscating the baronet's understanding.</p>
<p>Harry Gaynor was alive, above-stairs, and awaiting him. Those
facts he grasped clearly, and for the moment nothing more. He came
instantly to his feet.</p>
<p>"Why was I not told of this before? Why did your letter convey
no hint of it?"</p>
<p>"You must ask the Captain," said the professor, smiling. "I
would have communicated with his friends at once. But he would not
have it. A very cautious fellow for all his recklessness. But I
detain you, eh? This way, sir."</p>
<p>He led Sir John from the room and up a steep, dark staircase. He
paused on the narrow landing above, and after a preliminary tap he
threw open a door. The baronet entered and then halted abruptly, as
if in spite of what he had been told he still could not believe his
eyes which showed him Captain Gaynor in a quilted bed-gown standing
smiling to receive him.</p>
<p>Behind him the doctor had closed the door on the outside,
leaving the two friends alone.</p>
<p>"Harry!" cried Sir John, his voice husky.</p>
<p>"My dear Sir John!" said the Captain, and he held out a hand in
welcome. But the baronet, under the impulse of his overmastering
feelings, thrust aside the hand, and, opening wide his arms,
clasped the young man to his heart.</p>
<p>"My boy, my boy!" he mumbled brokenly, and the tears stood in
his eyes. "We have wept you dead, and you are restored to us
alive."</p>
<p>Presently, when the Captain had soothed Sir John's emotion and
brought him by slow degrees to the full acceptance of this amazing
state of things, they sat and talked at length, and Gaynor
expounded his plans, which were concerned with little more than his
immediate departure from England.</p>
<p>"The law may run that a man shall not suffer twice for the same
offence," he said, "but I am by no means sure that an exception
might not be made in the case of a dangerous Jacobite agent, that
the Government might not find ways of disposing of me did it leak
out that I have escaped my doom."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," the baronet agreed. "You are wise in that. You will
need money, perhaps?"</p>
<p>"I have," was the answer, "a letter of credit upon Childes,
under which I can draw something a little short of two thousand
guineas. But I think it would be wiser not to use it. For all that
the identification of Captain Jenkyn with Captain Gaynor might not
have been complete, yet it is generally understood, no doubt that
they are one and the same, and Childes might account it their duty
to advise the Government."</p>
<p>"You are right," said Sir John. "You must use my purse to any
extent you need."</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir," the Captain replied, without hesitation. "A
hundred guineas will suffice to get me to Rome."</p>
<p>"I will bring you the sum tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Then, I think, if Dr Blizzard will permit it, I will set out on
the following day. And now of yourself, Sir John?"</p>
<p>Sir John looked at him, and marvelled that there had been so far
no word of Damaris; yet he thought he understood the Captain's
hesitation. "Damaris," he said slowly, "will be as one born again
when I bear her these glad tidings."</p>
<p>He saw the clear-cut young face grow white, and he observed the
falter in the voice that asked him: "She&mdash;she has grieved?"</p>
<p>"Grieved, lad? She has been almost as lifeless as we deemed
yourself. Oh, but this will be great medicine. It will bring back
the roses to her cheeks, and the sparkle to her eyes. And"&mdash;he
stopped short, smitten of a sudden by a great thought&mdash;"it will
make an end of all danger of any such sacrifice as she has been
contemplating."</p>
<p>"Sacrifice? What sacrifice?"</p>
<p>Too late Sir John perceived that his words had exceeded
prudence. He could not now withdraw, and so he was forced to
confide in Captain Gaynor, to lay his own troubles before him. Nor
was he reluctant so to do; for upon the young man's resourcefulness
he founded a faint hope that some way might yet be perceived, not
apparent to Sir John himself, out of the danger that hung over
him.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor listened inscrutably to the tale that Sir John
unfolded; the only outward sign he made was to nod shortly when the
baronet pointed out the quality of the mesh in which Pauncefort was
enfolding him. When Sir John had done the young man rose, and with
hands clasped behind him, head bent in thought, he slowly paced the
length of the chamber from door to window and back again. He was
profoundly touched by the nobility of Damaris in her proposed
sacrifice and the nobility of Sir John in his determination to
frustrate her.</p>
<p>"For the present," Sir John had said, in conclusion, "I have
succeeded in persuading her that, far from removing the peril, she
will but increase it by consenting to marry that villain. If to
this were added the knowledge that you have been so incredibly, so
miraculously, spared, I think our work would be complete; for I am
convinced there would be an end to the despair upon which her
courage of self-sacrifice is founded."</p>
<p>"It&mdash;it amounts to that?" cried the Captain incredulously.</p>
<p>"My dear Harry, had you heard her say to me, 'I am but a
husk&mdash;all that was myself perished at Tyburn,' you had so gauged
the depth of that despair that you had been moved to tears."</p>
<p>He was not far from moved to them by the repetition of those
words. He paced on, resolving all that Sir John had told him,
seeking a way through this baffling tangle. At last, as he
approached the window for the second time, he paused and his face
lighted.</p>
<p>A course which he had earlier considered but which he had
discarded as too desperate where it was only calculated to serve
himself, recurred to him now. It was a reckless, adventurous
audacious course, which yet might succeed by virtue of its very
audacity. He threw back his head and laughed his full-throated,
musical laugh. Sir John looked up, almost startled by the
sound.</p>
<p>"I think," said the young man, "that it was high time that
Captain Gaynor should come to life again."</p>
<p>Sir John, completely bewildered, continued to stare at him,
whereupon that keen face became once more inscrutable.</p>
<p>"Look you, Sir John," he cried, "this danger of yours has been
exaggerated to you. Let us say that they arrest you. To convict you
they must still prove that Captain Gaynor and Captain Jenkyn were
one and the same man, and that fact has not yet been entirely
established."</p>
<p>"Pish!" said the baronet. "From the moment that it becomes
necessary to advance proof of that, the Government can have no
difficulty in doing so."</p>
<p>"Let us say that it can; let us say that witnesses could be
found&mdash;though, I confess, I know not whence. The Government must
still prove that you knew of my connection with the Jacobite
movement, that you knew me for an agent of the King over the Water,
and that I did not impose upon you as I imposed upon so many
others&mdash;including Mr Second Secretary Templeton."</p>
<p>"Oh, Harry, Harry! These are but straws that will never float me
through those waters, and you know it."</p>
<p>"I do not know it," said Harry, and he was smiling now. "But,
even so, I have a sort of raft in the background that may serve you
better."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>The Captain reflected a moment. Then&mdash;"I have yet a little work
to do upon it to render it seaworthy," he said thoughtfully "But I
hope to have all in readiness by tomorrow, when you come again. I
will tell you then."</p>
<p>And, despite Sir John's entreaties, not another word would the
soldier add until the morrow, when Sir John not only promised to
return but to bring Damaris with him, a promise which kept the
Captain awake for most of the night in mingling joy and fear at the
coming meeting.</p>
<p>But on the morrow, which was Tuesday, there was no sign of Sir
John. The Captain had made the best of himself with the black suit
in which he had been taken and hanged&mdash;the only suit he had. He had
procured flowers&mdash;baskets of roses and tall virginal lilies&mdash;to
deck his chamber for so wondrous an occasion. The morning went in
preparation; the afternoon in expectation; the evening in sick
disappointment and vain clingings to hope even after the candles
had been lighted. Eventually he went to bed, still buoyed by the
conviction that they must come tomorrow.</p>
<p>But the morrow again went by in the same manner, and still there
was neither sight nor sign of Sir John.</p>
<p>On the Thursday morning, worn out by this suspense, utterly
unable to bear more of it, the Captain borrowed the anatomist's
apprentice, who, on that former occasion, had carried a message to
Priory Close, and despatched him this time with a request by word
of mouth for news.</p>
<p>The youngster returned with a tale of a desolated house and the
information that Sir John had been arrested on returning home on
the Monday night.</p>
<p>The Captain drew a deep breath at the news; not a breath of
dismay, but of resolve, almost of relief. He thanked the messenger,
and when the lad had gone he turned to the anatomist, who sat with
him.</p>
<p>"Decidedly," he said grimly, "it is time I came to life again.
What's o'clock?"</p>
<p>"Eh?" said the professor. "O'clock? Why, 'twill be nearly
two."</p>
<p>"Then it is time I took my leave of you."</p>
<p>"Tut!" clucked the professor, rising. "D'ye mean ye're going,
eh? Where are ye going?"</p>
<p>"Back to life," said Harry Gaynor.</p>
<p>"But in your condition?" cried the dismayed anatomist, who was
reluctant to part with so amiable a guest. "Y'amaze me!"</p>
<p>"What ails my condition?" Gaynor asked him. "Look at me," he
commanded.</p>
<p>Down came the spectacles from the professor's forehead to his
nose.</p>
<p>"Ye've a somewhat feverish air," said he.</p>
<p>"That is anticipation," said the patient. He took the doctor's
hand. "There is a debt between us, my friend, that it would tax me
to discharge."</p>
<p>"Tut&mdash;tut!"</p>
<p>"Ye've been more than friend to me. And I hope that friends we
may remain, and that if at any time Harry Gaynor has it in his
power to serve you ye'll not forget to make him happy by
acquainting him with the circumstance."</p>
<p>"My dear sir, my dear lad! Tut&mdash;tut! Tut&mdash;tut!"</p>
<p>"I leave your hospitable and kindly roof, sir, with profound
regret. But this is not a parting. We remain friends, and"&mdash;he
hesitated an instant&mdash;"there is the matter of the charges to which
you have been put&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Sir!" the doctor exploded in the simulation of a towering rage.
"Am I a vintner? Do I keep a tavern?"</p>
<p>The Captain pressed his hands. "Forgive me," he said. "My
inability to repay the real debt rendered me the more eager in the
matter of this other trivial one."</p>
<p>"Not another word or ye'll affront me, eh!"</p>
<p>They parted the best of friends in the world, and, after the
Captain had gone, that lonely anatomist realised for the first time
in all his absorbed and studious years that his house in the Gray's
Inn Road was dingy, dull and dismal.</p>
<p>The Captain in his black suit and a hat that had been procured
for him by the professor's apprentice, with a couple of guineas in
his pocket borrowed from Dr Blizzard at parting, walked briskly
down the road across Holborn and on until he came into the slush
and filth of Temple Bar.</p>
<p>Here he hired him a chair, and was carried to that inn in
Chandos Street where he had alighted a fortnight ago, and where his
baggage would still be lying.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-20" id="ch-20"></a>Chapter 20. MR TEMPLETON IN
RETIREMENT</h2>
<p>Sir Richard Tollemache Templeton, in his distant lonely seat in
Devonshire, received from his cousin, the Second Secretary, a
letter which produced in him the greatest consternation.</p>
<blockquote>MY DEAR TOLLEMACHE [wrote the Second Secretary],&mdash;<i>De
profundis</i>&mdash;out of the very depths of despondency I write to
you, smitten down by a malignancy of fortune which I find it
difficult even now to credit should have encompassed me. It has
demanded of me the resignation of that high office which I held
under the Crown, and today I am a man who hides his head in shame
from the gloating stare of the vulgar, whose envy is ever gladdened
by the spectacle of one fallen from high estate. It is a full week
since the untoward event befell which has been the occasion of this
overwhelming disaster, yet it is only today that I am able
sufficiently to take heart and summon the courage necessary to
indite to you this miserable epistle, giving you, as is your due as
the head of our honourable house, news of my condition. It solaces
me almost, my dear Tollemache, that in such an hour, with the
burden of ridicule and disgrace upon my shoulders, I am able to
reflect that some of the blame for this attaches to yourself as
well. You are not to suppose by this that I presume to censure you.
We have both been the sport of malign Fate and of a villain who has
already expiated on the gallows the perversity of his existence.
But that you should have been cozened with me, that my cozening
should in part have been a natural sequel to your own, rather than
an independent error of mine, is a helpful reflection to me in this
dark hour. But for this merciful circumstance I should never be
able to show you my face again, I should not, indeed, have the
courage to indite these lines to you. The villain to whom I am
referring, my dear Tollemache, is one who imposed himself upon you
and abused the confidence with which, a little indiscriminatingly,
I fear (though it is an error to which all men are liable), you
honoured him. I speak of Henry Gaynor&mdash;or the man who called
himself by that name. Strong in my faith in his loyalty, a faith
rooted in your own absolute assurance of it, I defended him to the
utmost of my strength when imputations were cast upon that loyalty,
when it was first whispered that he was none other than the elusive
Jacobite agent who has been known by the name&mdash;for want of
knowledge of his real one&mdash;of Captain Jenkyn. So positive, you will
remember, were these assurances of yours that I stood between that
man and arrest, pledging my credit and my very honour for his
loyalty. But, as I have said, we have both been most grossly
abused. There came a moment when it was impossible to defend him
any longer. His arrest was ordered and effected and regarding
himself as lost he took the course so common with desperate men who
are cornered: he weakly confessed his treason and meekly submitted
to his fate. He was hanged a week ago, as he more richly deserved
than any man I have known of. Need I add more? Need I tell you how
this honour of mine which I had pledged was all but lost to me by
my rashness, how nothing remained me but to resign my office and
retire before the storm of contempt and ridicule which my lord
Carteret directed upon my luckless head? I am a broken man, my dear
Tollemache, and never was there one in greater need of sympathy and
pity, never one more lonely Though I hide me from the world, here
among my books, I cannot hide me from Emily, whose tongue these
days is as a sword of sharpness to my flesh. I can write no more.
But if you will take pity on my loneliness, and permit me to come
to you in Devonshire for a season, until this matter shall be
forgotten and I can again show my face among men, I shall be your
deeply grateful as I am your affectionate and unfortunate cousin,
EDWARD TEMPLETON.</blockquote>
<p>To Sir Richard this news had been altogether incredible. That
Lord Carteret, persisting in the absurd mistake, or urged on by
mistaken advisers, should, in spite of all, have gone the length of
arresting Harry Gaynor as Captain Jenkyn was not perhaps
surprising. But that Harry Gaynor&mdash;the Harry Gaynor he knew, of
whose career he conceived that he was acquainted with every phase,
whose every year, indeed, was accounted for by his
credentials&mdash;that this man should have admitted himself to be the
Jacobite agent in question was impossible to believe.</p>
<p>Sir Richard scouted the notion. His cousin was mad, or else some
monstrous error lay at the bottom of the affair.</p>
<p>He did not trouble to answer the letter. So overwhelmed was he
by its contents that two days after its receipt&mdash;so soon as he
could set in order certain affairs on his estate that demanded his
immediate attention&mdash;he set out for London. He arrived there two
days later, having travelled post-haste all the way, and the very
Thursday that saw Captain Gaynor leave the house of Professor
Blizzard saw Sir Richard's dusty chaise drawn up before his
cousin's door in Old Palace Yard.</p>
<p>He found the Second Secretary in his library. Edward Templeton
was in <i>deshabille</i>, although it was already past noon. He
wore a bed-gown of wine-coloured satin, and his cropped head was
hidden in a nightcap of the same hue. His long countenance seemed
to have grown longer, sallower and hollower in these last few days.
His chaps hung dolefully. He looked uncommonly like a bloodhound
that has been whipped, and his deep-set eyes were singularly
dolorous. To look at him was to perceive that here was a fellow who
pitied himself damnably.</p>
<p>He was standing to receive his cousin, and he went to meet him
with both hands held out.</p>
<p>"My dear Tollemache," (his deep voice boomed like the note of an
organ and was laden with a profound melancholy), "it is kind in you
to respond so readily to my appeal; to seek me here in
my&mdash;ah&mdash;tribulation."</p>
<p>"I could not wait for you to come to me," was the answer. "Your
news was so wild and utterly beyond belief that I must come in
person for its explanation ere I carry you back to Devonshire with
me."</p>
<p>"Wild and utterly beyond belief it may be, but it is true none
the less."</p>
<p>Sir Richard, still in his travelling clothes, flung himself into
a chair.</p>
<p>"Tell me of it," he said impatiently.</p>
<p>"What remains to tell? My letter&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, but your letter gave me no more than the broad fact.
I want the details ere I can believe."</p>
<p>"The details?" Mr Templeton paced the room with bowed head. He
came at last to stand by the writing table where he could face his
cousin. He looked through the window behind his cousin, and
observed the grey sky and drizzle of rain under which the shrubs in
his garden were drooping.</p>
<p>He told the tale with all that wealth of rhetoric that he used,
thus rendering his cousin's impatience almost frantic.</p>
<p>"Is that all?" quoth Sir Richard, when the tale was done.</p>
<p>"Is't not enough?" demanded the sometime Second Secretary. "It
has been enough to procure my ruin, Tollemache."</p>
<p>"And yet, weighed against my own knowledge of the man, it is not
enough to carry conviction."</p>
<p>"Oh, he was deep&mdash;infernally, subtly deep," boomed Mr Templeton.
"He completely bubbled you."</p>
<p>Sir Richard rose, and in his turn began to pace the chamber,
whilst his cousin now let himself sink into a chair, and sat, knees
on elbows and chin cupped in his palms.</p>
<p>"He was averse to coming to England," Sir Richard reasoned, "and
it was naught but my own insistence fetched him hither. Even when I
had prepared the letter for you, he must still idle there at
Naples, and I'll swear he would be idling there yet but for the
insistence which I employed."</p>
<p>"Ay&mdash;he was deep," was all that Mr Templeton could find to
answer.</p>
<p>"But his credentials!" Sir Richard insisted. "His credentials!
They were an almost complete record of his career, and not a year
of it since he was nineteen but was employed in some service
between here and the Far East."</p>
<p>"Forgeries!" growled his cousin.</p>
<p>"Forgeries? Not so. Did not yourself test two of them at the
proper embassies here in London?"</p>
<p>"Two&mdash;ay. But what of the others?"</p>
<p>"<i>Ab uno disce omnes</i>."</p>
<p>Mr Templeton crashed fist into palm. "The very argument I used
to my Lord Carteret&mdash;the very words I uttered! 'Sdeath, how he has
laughed at me since! Oh, blister me! you do not know what a butt
for mockery I am become."</p>
<p>"You say that he confessed?" Sir Richard's voice was laden with
ineffable incredulity.</p>
<p>"Abjectly."</p>
<p>"Y'amaze me! How did he bear himself at the trial?"</p>
<p>"Well, I am told. He was one of your cool, calm villains."</p>
<p>"Were ye not present?"</p>
<p>"Present?" cried Mr Templeton. "Do you not understand, man, that
from the hour of his arrest I durst not show my face i' the town?
Do you think I would go to Court to be pointed at by every
jackanapes as the man who was bubbled, the statesman who was this
traitor's sponsor? I may count myself fortunate that I was not,
myself, impeached."</p>
<p>And then Fate, that ironical stage manager, displayed its
interest in this comedy.</p>
<p>There was a tap at the door, and a footman entered.</p>
<p>"Captain Gaynor is below, sir, and begs leave to wait upon you,"
he announced.</p>
<p>The two men stared at him, as if they were both stricken into
stone.</p>
<p>At length, in a croak, came Mr Templeton's voice: "What the
devil did ye say?"</p>
<p>The footman stolidly repeated his announcement.</p>
<p>"Captain Gaynor?" echoed Mr Templeton, with an accent on every
syllable. "Cap-tain Gay-nor!" he repeated. "Are ye mad or
drunk?"</p>
<p>"Neither, sir," replied the footman, his manner as near pert as
any underling's manner dare be with the overawing Mr Templeton.</p>
<p>Mr Templeton screwed his face as he shot out the next question:
"D'ye know Captain Gaynor? I mean&mdash;have ye ever seen him
before?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes, sir; several times."</p>
<p>"And d'ye say this is he?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. Leastways, I think so, sir."</p>
<p>Sir Richard interposed. He was visibly as agitated as his
cousin.</p>
<p>"Best desire him to step up, Ned," he suggested. Mr Templeton
gave the order, and the intrigued footman vanished.</p>
<p>"What can it mean, Tollemache? What can it mean?"</p>
<p>"It seems to mean that I am right and that you and your
Government are wrong. For if this is really Captain Gaynor, then,
obviously, he is not Captain Jenkyn."</p>
<p>"You mean that Lord Carteret is mistaken!" cried the other, a
dazzling vista of reinstatement with the last and the best laugh on
his side opening suddenly before him. He heaved himself, excited,
from his chair, to collapse into it again an instant later. "But it
is absurd!" he said, and sneered. "Impossible."</p>
<p>On the word the door reopened and Captain Gaynor was ushered in.
He wore his close-fitting military blue coat buttoned to the chin,
canon boots and steel-hilted sword, and under his arm he carried
his looped and feathered hat.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly this was the man himself. Yet, as the cousins stared
at him, Edward Templeton disbelieved the evidence of his own
eyes.</p>
<p>The soldier advanced easily into the room, then bowed formally,
his heels together. "I trust, Mr Templeton, that I do not intrude.
Why, 'tis you, Dick!" he cried, perceiving who it was that stood
there. "I am indeed fortunate. I was considering a jaunt into
Devonshire, unless by now your cousin's efforts on my behalf have
borne the fruit we hope for. But what's amiss?" he cried on a
sudden, different note, looking from one amazed face to the
other.</p>
<p>"Will you tell me who the devil you are?" asked Mr
Templeton.</p>
<p>The Captain stiffened slightly; perplexity crept into his
face.</p>
<p>"Who the devil I am?" said he. "Why, who the devil should I be
but Captain Harry Gaynor, your obedient servant. I trust," he
added, as if he suddenly suspected a possibility, "I trust, sir,
that I have not unwittingly had the misfortune to offend you."</p>
<p>Mr Templeton looked at his cousin. "By God!" said he. "'Tis the
man himself."</p>
<p>"So it is," said Sir Richard, and on that he exploded into
laughter.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor looked from one to the other. His expression of
perplexity changed to one of annoyance.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," said he, very distant, "you'll forgive me if I say
that I find you vastly odd. And you, Dick&mdash;"</p>
<p>Sir Richard sprang to him and wrung his hand. "Oh, my dear
Harry," he cried, "although my manner seem odd, I swear I never was
more pleased to see you&mdash;or any man."</p>
<p>"Nor I&mdash;oddslife!&mdash;no," roared Mr Templeton, who savoured
already in imagination the triumph that was in store for him, his
complete vindication and the turning of those malicious shafts of
satire upon the fatuous Lord Carteret&mdash;their proper butt. "But can
ye explain it?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"Explain what, sir?" asked the apparently bewildered
soldier.</p>
<p>Mr Templeton changed his tone. "Where the devil have ye been
this fortnight past?"</p>
<p>"Where? Why, did I not announce to you my departure for Scotland
when last I came to take my leave of you? I should have tarried
longer in the north, but that I was unable to find any of the
friends I went to visit. So, as the north of itself has little
attraction for one who's accustomed to softer climates, I came
south again forthwith." He lied glibly and smoothly, and with
little hurt to his conscience. Again he observed that his audacity
had conquered completely here. Would it conquer as completely
elsewhere? He had little doubt of it now.</p>
<p>"And you have had no news of London in your absence?"</p>
<p>"Who should send me news' I have so few friends in England
nowadays."</p>
<p>"Then ye'll not have heard that Captain Jenkyn was taken and
hanged?"</p>
<p>"Captain Jenkyn'" echoed the soldier, after the manner of one
who searches his memory "D'ye mean the Jacobite agent. Faith, then,
the world's well rid of a meddlesome fool. But&mdash;" He paused to
stare at them, bewildered. "You tell me this, I see, with some
purpose."</p>
<p>It was Richard who interposed to tell him the story&mdash;suddenly
become so monstrously comical&mdash;that upon Captain Jenkyn, whose real
identity was unknown, had been thrust the identity of Captain
Gaynor.</p>
<p>The Captain laughed a little at first. Then he checked himself,
and grew very sober.</p>
<p>"But, 'tis a monstrous thing you tell me!" quoth he. "I cannot
lie under so absurd an error. It must be corrected forthwith. I
shall look to you, Mr Templeton, to do me justice."</p>
<p>"To me?" said Templeton. "Ye've further to learn that, as a
consequence of my jeopardising myself by denying the possibility of
your being Captain Jenkyn, I am no longer a member of the
Government. I have resigned my office. But there are reprisals in
store&mdash;egad! Reprisals!"</p>
<p>"Then I must see Lord Carteret at once," cried the Captain.</p>
<p>"So you shall&mdash;and I'll come with you." Mr Templeton was
recovering his habitual breadth of manner. "If ye'll but stay for
me till I am dressed, we will go together. And you had best come
with us, Tollemache."</p>
<p>"Faith! I ask no better entertainment," laughed Sir Richard.</p>
<p>But Captain Gaynor had yet a question to ask ere he would allow
Mr Templeton to withdraw. "But how came this mistake about, sir?
Was the fellow&mdash;Did he resemble me?"</p>
<p>"'Tis more than I can say, and less than matters now. I think my
Lord Carteret took too much upon assumption. It is all the work of
that fellow Pauncefort."</p>
<p>"Pauncefort!" cried the Captain, and alarm flashed into his
face. "Pauncefort! By heaven, then, I suspect some villainy here!
Gad! 'Twas no mistake this; 'twas deliberate! I'll post to Priory
Close and see Sir John Kynaston the moment I leave my Lord
Carteret's. Heaven send I am not too late. I curse the hour I ever
thought of Scotland."</p>
<p>"Sir John Kynaston!" exclaimed Mr Templeton very solemnly. "Why,
what do you fear for him?"</p>
<p>"For him&mdash;nothing. 'Tis not himself I'm thinking of."</p>
<p>"Then d'ye not know&mdash;But of course you do not. Sir John was
arrested two days ago."</p>
<p>Consternation spread on the face of that comedian. "Arrested?
Sir John? Upon what charge?"</p>
<p>"Why, upon the charge of having harboured a traitor and
spy&mdash;upon the charge of having harboured Captain Gaynor."</p>
<p>The Captain smote his brow with his clenched hand. "I see it
all, then!" he cried. "Let us waste no time, sir. Sir John must
instantly be restored to liberty."</p>
<p>"All things considered," said Sir Richard dryly, "I think my
Lord Carteret will be very pleased to see you."</p>
<p>"He'll be the laughing-stock o' the town," said Mr Templeton,
and he went out, chuckling, to make ready for that momentous
visit.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-21" id="ch-21"></a>Chapter 21. LORD CARTERET
UNDERSTANDS</h2>
<p>The arrest of Sir John Kynaston had been brought about, of
course&mdash;like all the others&mdash;by the agency of the renegade
Pauncefort. It was the last desperate throw he made in the game of
mending his fortunes, a game which had reduced him to the
treacherous infamy which he had perpetrated. But he intended that
it should be no more than the means to his end. It was no part of
his purpose that Sir John should ultimately suffer. That is to say,
it was no part of his present purpose.</p>
<p>He had pointed out to the Secretary of State the grounds upon
which Sir John should be arrested, and he had further informed
against him out of his own knowledge of Sir John's
association&mdash;however slight&mdash;with the Jacobite intriguers. But once
the arrest was effected, he had come again to my Lord Carteret with
the request that Sir John's fate should be placed in his own (Lord
Pauncefort's) hands. He claimed this as part of the recompense due
to him from the Government for the signal services he had
rendered.</p>
<p>Lord Carteret had listened to his request with that frank
contempt which the Secretary of State never failed to use towards
this man who had turned informer. This contempt was rendered the
more bitter on this occasion by the regard in which his lordship
had ever held Sir John Kynaston, against whom, indeed, he had
performed his duty most reluctantly&mdash;a feeling this which Lord
Pauncefort had omitted from his calculations.</p>
<p>The statesman pursed his thin lips and considered the viscount
in silence with that cold glance of his, which my Lord Pauncefort
found it so difficult to endure with equanimity.</p>
<p>"I find your request more than extraordinary, sir," said he.</p>
<p>Lord Pauncefort laughed. "If your lordship had my own
unfortunate acquaintance with the requests of creditors, you'ld
find little extraordinary in mine."</p>
<p>"By which," said the minister quietly, "you remind me, of
course, that you are my creditor; or, rather, that I am your debtor
for services rendered to the State. Ah!"</p>
<p>"I think, my lord, that I deserve some recompense beyond the
small sums of money which the Treasury has paid me."</p>
<p>Lord Carteret leaned back in his arm-chair, his finger-tips
resting upon the edge of the writing-table before him. "These small
sums, my lord, amount to close upon twelve thousand pounds. And in
addition you are kept out of a debtor's gaol by my warranty to your
creditors that your debts will be liquidated on your marriage. I
confess, sir, that you appear to me to have been more than well
paid already for the services that you have rendered. Some,
indeed," continued the statesman, with the faintest note of scorn
in his quiet voice, "would account that you have been paid far
above the value of those services, although I am not of those. I
recognise the position which you occupy, the estate to which you
were born, and the fact, hence, that you require to be bribed upon
a higher scale than does the ordinary&mdash;informer."</p>
<p>The viscount swallowed that last insult as best he could. He had
swallowed so many of Lord Carteret's already, in the course of
these very turbid transactions, that one more or less was of little
account. He kept his head high, and preserved a smiling front.</p>
<p>"I will admit, my lord, that the payment has been generous,
provided that it is completed. I mean, provided that I am enabled
to redeem the warranty your lordship has given my creditors."</p>
<p>"I am not sure," said the minister slowly, "that 'warranty' is,
after all, the proper word. But your creditors understand me, and
so, I think, do you."</p>
<p>"Perfectly, my lord. You have honoured me by giving your word as
bail for me to Israel Suarez and the others."</p>
<p>"And," Lord Carteret added, "it is entirely as a result of this
that you continue to elude imprisonment for debt."</p>
<p>"And," Lord Pauncefort added on his own side, "it is precisely
that your lordship may be relieved of your pledge for me that I
prefer my present request touching Sir John Kynaston."</p>
<p>"You do not forget, I trust, that I retain the right of
withdrawing my pledge at any moment, should it appear to me that
you may no longer continue in the assurance of being ultimately
able to satisfy your debts. But that is by the way. The thing you
now propose is exceedingly distasteful to me. Indeed, I am not sure
that I can honourably accede to such a request. I could do so only
if I were satisfied that&mdash;" He broke off, and sat forward. "But we
talk in the dark," he said more briskly "Let me understand what
ends you seek to serve by such a thing."</p>
<p>"Reasonable ends, my lord," replied Pauncefort easily "I have
already had the honour of informing your lordship of the terms of
the late Mr Hollinstone's will, under which it is in Sir John
Kynaston's power to withhold his sanction to his ward's marriage
until she is of full age&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," the statesman cut in. "You have already told me all
that. Moreover," he added, with another of his quietly incisive
manifestations of mistrust, "I have obtained independent
confirmation of the fact. Pray, continue."</p>
<p>"I have also had the honour of informing your lordship that my
betrothal to Miss Hollinstone does not receive Sir John's
sanction."</p>
<p>"Knowing and respecting Sir John as I do, I am not surprised,"
was the withering comment. "Well, what then?"</p>
<p>"Sir John, my lord, is under arrest."</p>
<p>"By your contriving&mdash;yes," said his lordship. "It is a matter,
let me tell you, concerning which your true motives have never
intrigued me. I was aware that your betrothal to the lady was not
sanctioned by her guardian" (his lordship was not, it seems, aware
that the betrothal had been cancelled), "and I perceived clearly
enough that his conviction as a rebel would disqualify him from
exercising his rights under the will. What I do not perceive is the
reason of your present intervention. I hope you are attempting no
double dealings with me, sir."</p>
<p>"Double dealings? I, my lord?"</p>
<p>"You don't know what they are, I suppose? Pshaw, sir! These
virtuous airs are unnecessary here. Who has betrayed once will
betray again. But I have no desire to recriminate, my lord. All I
desire is to warn you to be frank with me. What is your
aim?&mdash;briefly now, and clearly."</p>
<p>The viscount was forced to swallow this peremptoriness with the
rest. He was a knave unmasked, dealing with a man of honour.</p>
<p>"My lord," he answered, "I should have thought my aim would have
been clear. I have no ill-will against Sir John. If I am to wed his
niece I would not be the one to compass his ruin. I hope, sir, to
be able to induce him to change his mind on the subject of my
marriage with his niece either before or after the marriage has
taken place. I conceive, sir, that if I can visit him in prison and
offer to use my influence to procure his release and pardon,
natural gratitude should inspire Sir John no longer to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Fiddlesticks!" the statesman interrupted. "Natural gratitude,
faith! Why can you not be frank and tell me it is your intent to
drive a bargain with Sir John."</p>
<p>Pauncefort permitted himself a wry smile. "It amounts to that,
of course," he confessed. "And if I had the pardon in my pocket it
would perhaps strengthen my hand."</p>
<p>The statesman sat back again, toying thoughtfully with a quill,
and from that hesitation Lord Pauncefort gathered hope. He knew, as
we know, that if there was one thing more detestable to Lord
Carteret than these persistent Jacobite intrigues that simmered
under the peaceful surface of the realm it was their disclosure.
His policy was to stifle them; to strike alarm into the plotters
and to disband them, effecting this with as little publicity as
possible.</p>
<p>Now it was far from the Secretary of State's desire to procure
Sir John's conviction, since that must mean an increased publicity
for the Jacobite Cause. Ample for the Government's purpose was his
arrest. He might now be liberated, sufficiently shaken, no doubt,
to leave plotting alone in future. And if there were plausible
grounds for his enlargement, so much the better would the
Government be served. Now Lord Pauncefort's proposal afforded just
those plausible grounds; through his agency Sir John might be left
under the impression that his release had been the result of a
personal intervention. Nothing, then, but the statesman's mistrust
of Pauncefort caused him now to hesitate, whilst in his mind he
cast about him for any other possible end which the informer might
seek to serve. Presently a thought occurred to him.</p>
<p>"You do not by any chance require this pardon as an instrument
with which to compel the lady?" he inquired in his cold, level
voice.</p>
<p>Pauncefort was aghast at the minister's shrewdness, for Lord
Carteret had dropped plump upon his real aims. That, indeed, was
the last card that he proposed to play, confident that it was
strong enough to win the game for him. But if his face showed
anything it showed indignation of such a suggestion. That seeming
indignation kept him silent for a moment. Then he smiled slowly, as
it were in contempt of Lord Carteret's mistake.</p>
<p>"With the lady, sir, no compulsion is necessary, seeing that we
are betrothed already, and have been these six months, as all the
world knows."</p>
<p>It was a convincing answer, and yet it did not convince the
statesman; for none knew better than Lord Carteret the crookedness
of the man with whom he dealt. Slowly he shook his head, though for
a moment he said nothing. At last: "When is this marriage to take
place?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow evening at my place in Surrey," replied his lordship
promptly&mdash;and, indeed, subject to his production of the pardon in
question, such was the agreement he had that very morning wrung
from Damaris. His lordship fingered his quill a moment, then threw
it down like one who has taken his resolve.</p>
<p>"Come to me again when you are married, then," he said, "and we
will return to the subject. Very possibly I may do as you
desire."</p>
<p>Almost Lord Pauncefort committed the imprudence of protesting,
and thus betraying himself completely to one so shrewd as the
Secretary of State. He caught himself betimes. There was no more to
be said, and the more readily he professed his entire acquiescence
the better must it serve him.</p>
<p>He was checked for the moment. A fresh difficulty confronted
him. Nevertheless, he smiled as he rose to take his leave.</p>
<p>"Be it so, then, my lord," said he. "I shall have the honour of
waiting upon you again betimes on Friday."</p>
<p>Lord Carteret nodded. "Give you good-day," he said coldly, and
Lord Pauncefort withdrew, a smile on his lips and rage in his
heart, to think out the situation and discover a means to surmount
this obstacle which had presented itself where he had expected
none. That means he was not slow in discovering, for a half-hour
later he penned and despatched from his house in St James's Street
the following epistle to Miss Hollinstone:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>MY DEAREST DAMARIS,&mdash;I have but left my Lord Carteret,
and I take pen at once to send you these to dispel the anxiety in
which I know you to be lying. The Secretary of State has lent an
ear to my insistence, and is preparing Sir John's pardon. It will
receive his Majesty's signature tomorrow, and it shall be my
wedding gift to you when you come to Woodlands tomorrow
evening.</blockquote>
<p>This was followed by protestations of undying passion and
delirious anticipation with which we are not concerned, but in
which Lord Pauncefort must be done the justice of being
acknowledged sincere. He did with most delirious anticipation look
forward to his emancipation from Israel Suarez and this nightmare
of a debtor's gaol that was with him day and night, and had made a
villain of him.</p>
<p>Now all this happened on the Wednesday of that very momentous
week.</p>
<p>On the Thursday his lordship departed for his seat in Surrey, to
complete the preparations for the reception of the bride, and he
took with him, to serve his needs, a poor hedge parson of the name
of Pugh.</p>
<p>At about the same hour that his chaise rolled up St James's
Street and turned into Piccadilly, another carriage drew up at Lord
Carteret's door and deposited there Mr Templeton, Sir Richard and
Captain Gaynor, who thus descended upon the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>Mr Templeton came to explain&mdash;a sort of chorus to this comedy,
and something more; Captain Gaynor came to seek explanation; and
Sir Richard came as an important witness to certain matters, should
it be found that they required investigation.</p>
<p>They did not. The mountainous fact that Captain Gaynor stood
there in the flesh entirely crushed the absurd allegation that a
fellow convicted of being Captain Jenkyn, the Jacobite spy, and
hanged at Tyburn a fortnight since, had been this same Harry
Gaynor.</p>
<p>Obviously a most colossal blunder had occurred. Lord Carteret's
consternation flamed quickly to anger under the deft fanning of Mr
Templeton.</p>
<p>"Had your lordship but honoured me with attention,
this&mdash;ah&mdash;deplorable mistake had not occurred; had not occurred."
His voice rolled and boomed. "I strove with all my power, but your
lordship would not be guided. Even when I produced unimpeachable
evidence your lordship still&mdash;ah&mdash;preferred to give heed to other
counsellors. If you should now incur the&mdash;ah&mdash;ridicule of the
malevolent and of your political enemies, your lordship will
perhaps feel some sympathy for me in what I have undergone most
undeservedly."</p>
<p>"You are within your rights," answered his lordship bitterly,
his little eyes like gimlets upon Mr Templeton, "to point out to me
the error against which you warned me, and into which I fell, that
warning notwithstanding. But I will beg you, sir, not to turn the
sword in the wound."</p>
<p>"Oh, my lord! I should be the last to be guilty of such
an&mdash;ah&mdash;inhumanity. If I have said so much it has been to justify
the insistence of my warning."</p>
<p>"With Captain Gaynor before us it requires no justifying," said
his lordship.</p>
<p>"I pledged my honour," Mr Templeton continued, "and I accounted
my honour forfeit. I resigned my office under that assumption, and
under that assumption your lordship accepted my resignation. I have
been the butt of every scandalous tongue in town&mdash;of every
scandalous&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It is possible," cut in his lordship, who felt it necessary to
bribe Mr Templeton into silence not only here but hereafter, "that
your successor in office might be&mdash;induced to resign to the end
that justice be done and yourself reinstated."</p>
<p>"In that," said Mr Templeton, bowing, "I recognise your
lordship's high sense of justice."</p>
<p>"To you, sir," continued his lordship, turning to Captain
Gaynor, who stood stiffly at attention, "I shall see that proper
reparation is made by publishing the error there has been&mdash;an error
which even now, I confess, is entirely baffling."</p>
<p>Upon audacity Captain Gaynor now piled audacity.</p>
<p>"It is possible," said he, "that I may be able to elucidate the
matter."</p>
<p>"Do you suggest one of those freaks of nature by which two men
are given such identical features that one is not to be told from
the other?"</p>
<p>"No such matter is in my mind. Though I am unable to speak as to
a likeness between myself and this Captain Jenkyn, for I have never
consciously stood face to face with him. I think, my lord, that the
matter goes deeper. From what Mr Templeton has told me I understand
that Sir John Kynaston has been arrested for having harboured
me&mdash;always upon the assumption that I was the man who was hanged a
fortnight ago."</p>
<p>His lordship grimaced. "Ay!" he said irritably.</p>
<p>"That will be another error to correct," put in Mr Templeton
quietly. There can be no doubt that Mr Templeton was enjoying
himself.</p>
<p>"And I gather further that this, as well as the confusion of the
late Captain Jenkyn with myself, is the work of my Lord
Pauncefort."</p>
<p>"Yes," said his lordship, and he confirmed the affirmative by an
oath.</p>
<p>"I find this the more extraordinary in that I am perfectly well
known to his lordship&mdash;at least, on that score I should find it the
more extraordinary did I not believe that I hold the explanation of
his most singular behaviour."</p>
<p>"What d'ye tell me?" demanded Lord Carteret sharply. "D'ye say
that Lord Pauncefort knew you?"</p>
<p>"He knows me, my lord, as well as he knows Dick Templeton there,
who is one of my oldest friends."</p>
<p>"Then&mdash;what the devil!&mdash;" His lordship paused. His friendship
for Sir John Kynaston, combining with his mistrust of Pauncefort,
spurred him suddenly to incredible conclusions. "D'ye suggest he
did this thing&mdash;that he made a tool of me&mdash;to serve ends of his
own?"</p>
<p>"I will suggest nothing," said Captain Gaynor. "I will state the
facts."</p>
<p>He played boldly now. He saw that he held Pauncefort in the
hollow of his hand, and he would have played as boldly and
unwincingly had Pauncefort, himself, been present&mdash;for not all that
nobleman's protestations and oaths could annihilate the
overwhelming fact that the man whom he had alleged to be Captain
Gaynor had been hanged a fortnight ago at Tyburn, whilst Captain
Gaynor, himself, was alive.</p>
<p>"I shall need to trouble your lordship with some purely personal
details," he said. "When, upon the instances of Dick Templeton
here, I came to England a month ago with letters to his cousin, the
Second Secretary, and in the hope of finding employment for my
sword in the service of my own country, I sought the hospitality of
one who had been my father's dearest friend. I am speaking of Sir
John Kynaston. Whilst there, my lord, being in Sir John's
confidence, I learnt that a betrothal which had existed between his
ward and my Lord Pauncefort had lately been determined in
consequence of the discovery of&mdash;of certain unworthy motives in his
lordship's suit."</p>
<p>"Determined?" cried the minister. "Determined, did ye say?" And
swiftly his suspicions grew to certainty. "But I beg you to
proceed," he added, almost grimly. "You promise to be very
interesting."</p>
<p>Some vague fraction of what was passing in his lordship's mind
was perceived by Captain Gaynor. It served to encourage him.</p>
<p>"It happened, sir," he resumed, "that I met the lady, and&mdash;and,
in short, that his lordship had reason to behold in me a rival
whom, under the circumstances of his own disfavour, he had cause to
fear. Shortly thereafter, and in my absence from town, my name, I
find, is given to a notorious rebel, the report of my execution set
abroad, and my friend Sir John arrested for having harboured
me."</p>
<p>Upon the faces of his listeners he saw clearly stamped the
impression he had made and the conclusion to which all three had
instantly jumped.</p>
<p>"Do you imply, sir, that it was to serve such ends as these that
the villain so abused my confidence?" said the statesman in a voice
that was like a knife's edge.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor shook his head, his face inscrutable.</p>
<p>"Far be it from me to imply anything, my lord," he answered.
"Naturally I must draw my own inferences; but those inferences you
will permit me to keep to myself. It would be unfair in me to utter
them, since I am an interested party, and&mdash;like all interested
parties&mdash;subject to the sway of interest. Therefore I state the
facts&mdash;no more. Your lordship must draw the inferences for
yourself. You have acted in this matter upon certain information.
You will hold, no doubt, that my presence here today, alive, is a
sufficient proof of the falseness of such information. When in
conjunction with that you consider what else I have now told you,
you will be able to judge clearly for yourself the truth of this
matter."</p>
<p>In his anger at seeing his every suspicion confirmed&mdash;at
discovering, as he believed, that he had been so unscrupulously
used&mdash;the Secretary of State came suddenly to his feet.</p>
<p>"Oh!" he cried, like a man who stifles, "it&mdash;it is
incredible&mdash;as incredible as it is undeniable."</p>
<p>"Not so incredible, perhaps, when your lordship knows what else
is behind," said the Captain. "Sir John's consent to Pauncefort's
marriage with Miss Hollinstone is necessary, as otherwise&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know, I know," the minister interrupted. "Sir, you can add
nothing that I do not know already; nothing that I cannot now
perceive for myself."</p>
<p>It was the Captain's turn to be astonished. But he was careful
to show nothing of it.</p>
<p>"Oddslife!" swore Lord Carteret. "I suspected yesterday that he
required Sir John's pardon for purposes of coercion with the lady.
I did not know that the betrothal stood annulled. But you have made
all clear to me. My Lord Pauncefort shall be taught a lesson that
will last him all his life. As for you, sir, it remains for you to
see to't that the lady's credulity is not abused as mine has been.
I could desire no better agent than yourself. That rascal
Pauncefort is to marry her this evening."</p>
<p>The Captain's self-possession all deserted him on the instant.
He changed colour; his eyes dilated.</p>
<p>"This&mdash;this evening!" he faltered.</p>
<p>"Do not be alarmed," his lordship smiled. "You will be in time
to prevent it." He resumed his seat. Under an exterior now of
habitual iciness, anger still raged fiercely in Lord Carteret's
bosom at the thought that he should have been no more than a
tool&mdash;as he was forced to infer&mdash;in the hands of that spy whom he
despised. Thus Lord Pauncefort was overwhelmed by the peril that
ever threatens a traitor. The very hand that hires such men to
their work is the very first to turn against them at the suggestion
that they betray their present as they betrayed a former trust.</p>
<p>"Even were I too late to prevent, I should not be too late to
amend it," said the Captain through his teeth. But the statesman
held up a hand in warning.</p>
<p>"Do not misapprehend me, Captain Gaynor. Do not assume that I am
sanctioning any such step as you have in mind. All that I desire is
that you intervene in time to save a lady from marrying a
blackguard. The rest you can very safely leave to others." He
paused, then added: "If this wedding does not take place tonight,
the world will be little troubled by my Lord Pauncefort hereafter."
Then, taking up a pen, and speaking in a brisk voice: "I will issue
an order for Sir John Kynaston's instant release," he announced,
"and yourself, sir, shall be the bearer of it. Possibly Sir John
may see fit to accompany you to Woodlands. Possibly, also, he may
show a proper gratitude for the very timely service you have
rendered him in returning so opportunely from your wanderings."</p>
<p>He wrote rapidly, almost whilst speaking; then, having sanded
the document, he rose, and handed it to Captain Gaynor.</p>
<p>"There is the order," he said. He turned to Mr Templeton and
desired him to stay for a word in private, and then he escorted the
other two as far as the hall.</p>
<p>"You were seeking an appointment in the Colonies sir, I
understand," he said to the Captain at parting, "but no doubt you
will be changing your mind on that score if you think of marrying.
If not, pray command me."</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor thanked him, and took his leave. But as he went
down the steps of the mansion, arm in arm with Sir Richard:</p>
<p>"Whatever betide me," said he, "I'll never abide in England. Ye
did me an ill turn in sending me hither, Dick. 'Tis too unsettled a
country; too full of plottings and schemings and intrigues to suit
my simple nature."</p>
<p>"I think you're right," said Sir Richard. "You men of action are
no match for schemers."</p>
<p>"Ay, ay!" said the Captain sadly, and he shook his head.
Presently he sighed. "Heigho!" And Sir Richard was not to guess
that this was regret for dissimulation and intrigue of a singularly
subtle sort&mdash;a regret occasioned by the reflection that for his
very life's sake&mdash;and for the sake of others&mdash;he dare not tell the
truth to this good fellow and best of friends, who was so uplifted
to know him alive and well.</p>
<p>"I am coming to Woodlands with you tonight," said Sir Richard
presently, "to see the end of this affair."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-22" id="ch-22"></a>Chapter 22. ISRAEL SUAREZ</h2>
<p>Woodlands, my Lord Pauncefort's seat in Surrey, was a handsome,
red-brown Tudor mansion, situated in a park of some two hundred
acres, within a couple of miles to the north of the town of
Guildford. His lordship had dined late on that July evening, for he
had been late in arriving from town, and even then, ere he would
dine, he must perform an elaborate toilet as befitted the
bridegroom he hoped to be ere the night was out. He went below at
length, an elegant, resplendent figure in a suit of grey satin with
silver lace and dark purple linings; his pearl-grey silk stockings
were decorated with ramifications of silver thread; diamonds hung
like prismatic drops of water in the fine Mechlin lace of his
cravat, and his long, graceful hands were almost hidden in his
ruffles; buckles of French paste flashed on his shoes, and he wore
a powdered tie-wig of the very newest mode, which emphasized the
swarthy, male beauty of his face.</p>
<p>When he stepped at last into the long panelled dining-room,
where the Reverend Thomas Pugh&mdash;the seedy hedge parson he had
brought from London&mdash;waited impatiently with his hunger, the
clergyman had gasped his admiration of so very dazzling an
apparition, and had all but forgotten his inner gnawings in the
feasting of his eyes. And had my Lord Pauncefort been at pains to
find a foil that should throw his own splendour into greater
relief, no selection could have been more happy than that of this
squat fellow, black as a crow in his rusty parson's livery, his
lantern jaws blue from the razor.</p>
<p>His lordship ate but little, and spoke still less during the
repast. He was in a state of obvious nervousness vexed by the
incompleteness of his preparations and anxiety lest he should fail
to ruffle through and conquer Damaris in spite of this.</p>
<p>The dinner came to an end; the cloth was raised and the candles
were lighted; still the two men sat on, over their wine now, with
but little talk passing between them. Pauncefort reclined in his
chair, frowning gloomily at the globular decanter of port, from
which the candles struck fire, so that it glowed like a gigantic
carbuncle. The long windows stood open to the stifling air, and the
twilight sky was of a velvet blackness streaked with a fading but
ominous purple. Not a breath stirred. The candles in their gilt
sconces on the wainscoting burned steadily, throwing long shafts of
reflection upon the polished timbers of the dark brown floor.</p>
<p>At last, from the distance, faintly, came the sound of hoofs. It
approached rapidly, and with it now came the grind of wheels
advancing up the avenue. His lordship listened, and he seemed to
have ceased to breathe. His eyes glowed feverishly She came at
last!</p>
<p>"I think 'twill be the bride," ventured the parson timidly&mdash;for
these long spells of silence and the moodiness of his host were
fretting his ill-conditioned nerves.</p>
<p>My lord paid no heed to him; so the reverend gentleman sipped
his wine and uneasily eyed his companion from under shaggy
brows.</p>
<p>The carriage halted. Unable longer to remain still, his lordship
rose, thrusting back his tall chair. He glanced at the timepiece on
the overmantel. It wanted a few minutes to nine; and nine was the
hour appointed. This trifling earliness augured well, he
thought.</p>
<p>The door opened quietly behind him. He swung round in sudden,
trembling eagerness to face the liveried servant who entered, and
to receive an announcement which was as a shower of cold water upon
his feverish impatience.</p>
<p>"Mr Suarez is here, my lord, asking to see you."</p>
<p>"Suarez?" His lordship's voice rasped harshly with sudden anger.
Yet his dilating eyes and loosened mouth were evidences of still
another emotion. "Suarez?" he repeated.</p>
<p>"I told him, my lord, that your lordship could see no one
tonight. But he insists that his business is of the greatest
urgency."</p>
<p>"And so it is, my lord," came a deep voice from behind the
servant, and immediately the heavy figure and ovine face of the
usurer made its appearance in the doorway.</p>
<p>He had followed the lackey, determined to force himself into his
lordship's presence and fearing that did he wait for permission he
might wait in vain.</p>
<p>The servant attempted now to detain him: but it was too late.
The Jew thrust the fellow contemptuously aside, and rolled into the
room.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" his lordship challenged him. His face was
white with anger and his eyes were murderously set upon the
intruder.</p>
<p>"Vat do I vant?" echoed Mr. Suarez, his manner excited and his
speech thick with passion. "Vat do I vant? I vant a deal, my lord,
I promise you. To begin vit', I vant an explanation."</p>
<p>"By God!" swore his lordship. "Ye're a daring rogue to thrust
yourself in here in this fashion."</p>
<p>The other waved a fat, powerful hand. "Bah! I don't vant vords,
and I don't vant ugly names. I charge for ugly names, my lord, and
the rate of interesht on t'em is heavy. Shall I speak before
t'ese?" And he waved his hand again, to indicate servant and
parson. "Or vill you see me alone? 'Tis all one to me," he added
contemptuously.</p>
<p>His lordship considered the man an instant, mastering his rage.
Then he turned to the servant.</p>
<p>"Leave us," he said shortly, "and you too, Pugh. Go wait in the
library."</p>
<p>The parson finished his wine, and departed with the servant.</p>
<p>Suarez looked on, a sneer on his heavy face. "Ha!" he commented.
"Very 'igh and mighty! Ve-ry lordly for a damned pauper!"</p>
<p>Israel Suarez was none of your gabardined, bewhiskered, cringing
Jews, over-conscious of belonging to a despised race. Himself proud
of his Jewish blood, he had naught but contempt for those who
despised it. Being enormously wealthy and knowing the power of
wealth, he used that power remorselessly, and upon none so
remorselessly as upon those who dared to show their scorn of him on
the score of race. To these he repaid contempt with contempt,
insult with insult; and since he had the power on his side, his
contempt and his insult usually proved the more hurtful and
crushing in the end.</p>
<p>In appearance he had almost the air of a man of fashion, saving
perhaps that with his natural taste for Oriental splendour he
rather overdressed the part. His claret-coloured coat was stiff
with gold lace, as was the crimson waistcoat under it, every button
of which was a ruby of price. Brilliants flashed in his lace
neckwear and on two fingers of each hand. A gold-hilted sword hung
at his side.</p>
<p>Massive and powerful of frame, with large liquid eyes, a
pendulous nose and a shaven olive-tinted skin, this Spanish Jew was
a somewhat extraordinary and compelling personality. The
consciousness of power he derived from his vast wealth lent him a
forceful air. Obviously he was not a man with whom it would be safe
to trifle. Save for a trouble with the aspirate, the "w" and the
"th," his English was fluent and good.</p>
<p>My Lord Pauncefort had made the mistake of undervaluing him. He
had trifled with him; he was trifling with him now, running a
scornful, critical eye over the man's person and apparel, and
expressing his contempt for one and the other by the deliberate
curl of his lip.</p>
<p>The Jew's watchful eyes observed all this. His answer to it was
not long delayed. He strode to the table and poured himself a glass
of port without hesitation or "by your leave." He tasted it,
smacked his lips and paused appraisingly.</p>
<p>"'Tis a good vine," he said, with marked satisfaction. "I 'ope I
'ave a good stock of it in my cellar 'ere."</p>
<p>"What the devil do you mean&mdash;damn you!" said Pauncefort.</p>
<p>Mr Suarez coolly drained the glass, and sat down unbidden,
leaving his lordship standing.</p>
<p>"I suppose I can drink my own vine in my own 'ouse vit'out
explanations to you&mdash;damn you!" he answered in the same tone. He
had his anger under control by now. Indeed, although by nature of a
hot and fiery temper, he was your deadly fellow who knows how to be
cold in the expression of it.</p>
<p>And then, before Pauncefort had recovered from that blow, Suarez
crisply added enough to show his business there that night.</p>
<p>"Ye see, I've 'ad vard from my Lord Carteret t'at 'is varranty
for you is vit'drawn. So my man Cohen is in possession of your
'ouse in town and I am 'ere. I 'ave a varrant in my pocket and
t'ree men vit' me&mdash;in t'e 'all now. An agent of mine is on 'is vay
to your place in Yorkshire. Ye see, I vaste no time." He smiled up
at his lordship, who was too stricken to answer him. Presently he
resumed. "You owe me t'irty t'ousand pounds, my lord. Voodlands
'ere vihl bring four t'ousand; your 'ouse in town perhaps t'ree,
and your Yorkshire estate seven or eight t'ousand vhen I sell it.
For t'e rest I must take your body until you or your friends see a
vay to ransom it. Now you know vat I vant," he leered. "Now you
know vat a damned impudent rogue I am, t'rusting myself into my own
'ouse, eh!"</p>
<p>Pauncefort leaned heavily against the overmantel to steady his
trembling body. He was limp. His blood had turned to water. Of all
that the money-lender had said, but one sentence remained with his
lordship. This sentence he echoed now in a husky voice.</p>
<p>"Lord Carteret has withdrawn his warranty!"</p>
<p>"Just so," said Mr Suarez. "Myself I marvel t'at he ever gave
it."</p>
<p>"But&mdash;" faltered Pauncefort, ceasing to wonder or to seek a
cause for this, and coming straight to the urgent effect of it,
"but even so! What does it matter?"</p>
<p>"It matters just t'irty t'ousand pounds," said Mr Suarez. "You
know t'at not'ing but his lordship's varranty has kept me from
claiming my own t'is mont' past."</p>
<p>"But my marriage is to take place tonight," cried his lordship.
He was white and drops of perspiration stood upon his shallow
brow&mdash;that one deplorable feature of his handsome face.</p>
<p>And now Mr Suarez returned the other's late silent sneer of his
apparel.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said he, sneering in his turn. "Ye look very festive,
codso! A very pretty fellow in your bridegroom finery!"</p>
<p>His lordship attempted to stiffen, but failed. The other was too
much the master of this situation.</p>
<p>"You know&mdash;it is your business to know&mdash;the wealth of Miss
Hollinstone. Is not that warranty enough for you?"</p>
<p>"Tat? Pish! No marriage prospects are varranty enough for me, as
you vell know. Not only vould I not advance you a shilling on such
prospects, but t'ey vould never have kept me from foreclosing on
you if you 'adn't obtained me Lord Carteret's varranty that you
vould be in a position to pay&mdash;failing which, your estates and your
person&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But my God! you'll give me until tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"Not an 'our," said Suarez. "Why should I?"</p>
<p>"Because you'll be a fool if you don't."</p>
<p>Suarez laughed shortly. "I was never a fool yet in business, my
lord. Never!"</p>
<p>His lordship advanced to the table and flung himself into a
chair. He faced Mr Suarez with the board between them. He leaned
across, and his white, clammy face glistened in the golden
candlelight.</p>
<p>"Suarez," he said, "consider, pray, that all I have had from you
in actual cash does not amount to over fifteen thousand pounds. You
hold Woodlands, my town house and my place in Yorkshire, and you
know&mdash;in spite of what you have said&mdash;that they will yield more
than that sum."</p>
<p>"Ye don't suppose I should 'ave advanced the money unless I vas
satisfied of t'at? Or do you imagine money lending to be a
philant'ropy, my friend? It is a risky business, and in risky
businesses the profits must be heavy to compensate. And ye leave
out of all account the interesht my money vould 'ave yielded me
elsewhere."</p>
<p>"'Tis you leave that out of account when you come here with a
warrant to seize my person. If you seize me you'll never see your
filthy interest."</p>
<p>Mr Suarez closed one eye.</p>
<p>"T'ere's t'e interesht from the entailed property," he reminded
his lordship. "It is close upon fifteen 'undred pounds a year. Now,
nicely lodged in the Fleet, my lord&mdash;and ve'll make you as
comfortable as you can expect&mdash;you can live luxuriously on fifty
pounds a year."</p>
<p>"D'ye mean I'm to spend ten years in a spunging-house?" roared
his lordship, turning savage.</p>
<p>"Rather more," said Mr Suarez, with pursed lips. "Interesht will
be running on the unpaid balances, ye see. But your lordship is
very 'ealthy, and should easily last the time."</p>
<p>"Suarez," raged his lordship, "ye're a dirty Jew."</p>
<p>"Pauncefort," answered Mr Suarez imperturbably, "ye're a dirtier
Christian to incur debts ye cannot meet."</p>
<p>His lordship leapt to his feet as if he had been struck. To be
insulted thus by this scum of Israel! It was past endurance, past
belief!</p>
<p>He was unarmed at the moment, or assuredly he would have drawn
upon the fellow. As it was, his hand flew to his side where his
sword should have hung. The Jew watched the movement with a cold
smile. With a steady hand he poured himself another glass of
wine.</p>
<p>"I vonder," he said, smiling reflectively, "vhen your lordship
vill learn t'at unprofitable insult is t'e sport of fools? I am
endeavouring to teach you." He drained his glass, and rose. "Shall
ye be going now?" he asked, and his question had all the ring of a
command.</p>
<p>Pauncefort steadied himself, his hands upon the table, leaning
so heavily that his knuckles showed white as marble.</p>
<p>"Going?" he echoed.</p>
<p>"Did I not say t'at I 'ave a varrant for you in my pocket and
t'ree men to execute it for me? Ye'ld never be so mad as to try
resistance!"</p>
<p>"D'ye mean&mdash;" His lordship moistened his lips. "D'ye mean ye'll
take me now&mdash;now? That ye'll not wait until tomorrow; until I am
married and can repay you?"</p>
<p>"Married?" sneered the Jew. "D'ye still seek to bubble me vit'
t'at?"</p>
<p>"Bubble you? It's the truth, man."</p>
<p>Mr Suarez considered him with brooding eye. "If it vere the
trut', vy did Lord Carteret vit'draw his varranty for you?
Pshaw!"</p>
<p>"It is the truth, nevertheless," the viscount insisted
vehemently. "I await the lady now."</p>
<p>But Suarez was still incredulous. "To be sure you do," said he.
"But I t'ink a bird in t'e 'and is vort'&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Listen, Suarez," cried the other desperately. "Leave me free to
make this marriage, and you shall be paid in full by Monday next if
not before. More, from now until the debt is liquidated I'll pay
you further interest at the rate of a thousand pounds a day."</p>
<p>Now this was business, and to business Mr Suarez could listen.
Also the earnestness of the proposal seemed to argue that, indeed,
his lordship counted upon being married. But, on the other hand, he
might be counting upon something very different. It might be a ruse
to elude the moneylender and flee the country. He did not trust
this gentleman who had manifested slipperiness already in the past.
So he sighed over the offer, and shook his head.</p>
<p>"I'll make it two thousand&mdash;two thousand a day!" his lordship
clamoured.</p>
<p>But now the moneylender's every doubt was dispelled. He
laughed.</p>
<p>"Ye're over-reckless to be 'onest," he said. "Ye're lying about
t'is marriage."</p>
<p>A sound in the stillness of the night caught his lordship's
ears. His face flushed suddenly.</p>
<p>"Am I lying?" he cried. "Am I?" He was almost exultant.
"Listen!" And he flung an arm towards the open window and the night
beyond.</p>
<p>Mr Suarez heard the sounds of a carriage coming up the
avenue.</p>
<p>"That will be Miss Hollinstone," his lordship announced with
confidence.</p>
<p>The usurer stared at him for a long moment in silence.</p>
<p>"D'ye still doubt me?" cried Pauncefort. "D'ye still think that
no marriage will take place. Why, man, did ye not see the parson
here? Why else should I have sat at table with that crow?"</p>
<p>It was, indeed, something whose significance the Jew had
overlooked. Quietly he resumed his seat at the table.</p>
<p>"I'll stay to see," he announced. His lordship heaved a sigh of
relief, and fell to mopping his brow. A pause followed, ended at
last by Mr Suarez. "Two thousand pounds a day further interesht you
proposed, I think," he said.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," was the eager assent.</p>
<p>"I'll consider the proposal," said Mr Suarez coolly.</p>
<p>"Will you, by God!" cried Pauncefort, who was rapidly recovering
from his terror. "Ye'll accept it now, or ye'll refuse it."</p>
<p>"T'en I'll refuse it," said Mr Suarez.</p>
<p>"No, no! I meant not that. Consider it, sir, by all means. But
decide quickly&mdash;for heaven's sake!"</p>
<p>Mr Suarez laughed. "Ye're all 'ot and cold in a moment," he
sneered. "If I consider it at all, 'tis purely to oblige you. Vell,
vell&mdash;"</p>
<p>The servant entered, and his lordship turned to him a white,
excited face.</p>
<p>"Miss Hollinstone has arrived, my lord."</p>
<p>Pauncefort flashed a glance of triumph upon the usurer. "Well?"
he demanded. "You accept?"</p>
<p>"Ye-es&mdash;when I am sure of t'e business vich brings t'e
lady."</p>
<p>Lord Pauncefort stared at him. Then, in disgust: "Ye're a
reckless fellow, Suarez!" he said.</p>
<p>"I 'ave to deal vit' so many rogues," said Suarez in
explanation. Then he looked towards the servant. "Ah?" said he
significantly.</p>
<p>"Wait without," barked his lordship, and the man vanished,
closing the door.</p>
<p>"You tell me t'at the lady comes to marry you now?" Suarez
questioned.</p>
<p>"Yes," answered his lordship. "You saw the parson."</p>
<p>"Ah! Vell t'en, my lord, you shall 'ave t'is chance. I vill
accept your proposal if t'e marriage takes place tonight, and I,
myself, am one of t'e vitnesses."</p>
<p>Pauncefort glared at him between impatience and anger. But he
mastered his feelings. "Be it so," he consented. "Meanwhile, will
you join the parson in the library, and wait there until the
ceremony is to be performed?" And catching a fresh look of doubt in
the moneylender's eye: "You can place one of your men outside that
door, another under the window, and another," he added, sneering,
"on the roof, if you please, to see that I don't go up the chimney.
Arm them, and thus you should be sure that I shall not escape
you."</p>
<p>Mr Suarez bowed. "Very good," was all that he answered.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-23" id="ch-23"></a>Chapter 23. THE LAST THROW</h2>
<p>My Lord Pauncefort, alone in the dining-room, with pulses
throbbing, partly from anticipation and partly from the stress of
the recent interview, awaited the coming of Damaris.</p>
<p>Mr Suarez had left him shaken and rather dazed. He realised the
imminence of his danger, the possibility that after all he might be
unable to constrain Damaris into the wedding, seeing that he could
not produce the pardon, which was the price agreed upon.</p>
<p>He beat down his fears almost angrily. He crossed to the massive
sideboard and poured himself a glass of brandy to quiet his
tremors. Scarce had he drained it when the door opened and, in
wimple and hood, Damaris stood before him.</p>
<p>He sprang to meet her, at once the eager lover with no thought
in the world that was not of herself.</p>
<p>"My dearest Damaris!" was his greeting, and he would have caught
her to him but that something in her face and bearing held him off
as if a barrier stood between them.</p>
<p>She was very pale, and under her eyes there were dark lines that
told of the anguish in her soul. She stood erect and with a calm
that was something like the calm of the martyr in the hour of doom.
Her long, black cloak had fallen open, disclosing a deep purple
gown below. He observed it, and almost shuddered at the omen of
such colours on a bride.</p>
<p>"You have obtained Sir John's pardon, my lord?" she asked
him.</p>
<p>"I have," he answered promptly.</p>
<p>She drew a deep breath, and for a moment closed her eyes. It was
almost as if his answer occasioned her a shock&mdash;as if she had hoped
that he would fail. Though, had he answered her in the negative, it
is possible that she would have experienced a stab no less acute.
Before her had lain a choice of evils so terrible that the abiding
one must ever seem the worse because the more imminent. In either
case must she have steeled herself to resignation.</p>
<p>She held out a hand. "Let me see it," she begged, her voice
expressionless.</p>
<p>He showed no slightest hesitation, such as might convey to her
that all was not as he would have her believe.</p>
<p>"It is not here," he replied, quite at his ease&mdash;as if what he
had to say was what under the circumstances should be expected. "It
has gone to his Majesty for signature, and will be delivered to me
tomorrow."</p>
<p>She looked at him stonily a moment. Then she gathered her cloak
about her again.</p>
<p>"You are sure?" she asked. "There is no doubt of this?"</p>
<p>"No shadow of doubt," he answered firmly. "My Lord Carteret has
pledged me his word that I shall have it tomorrow." And so, indeed,
Lord Carteret had all but done&mdash;subject to the marriage taking
place tonight in proof that the pardon was no part of any bargain
between Pauncefort and the lady.</p>
<p>"In that case, my lord, I will come again tomorrow."</p>
<p>"You will come again tomorrow?" he cried, the blank look in his
face advertising the sudden dashing of his rising hopes. "But,
Damaris&mdash;consider! You are here now&mdash;in the house of which you are
to be the mistress. Need a few hours matter, then?"</p>
<p>"No," she answered, "they will not matter. Will you ring for
someone to reconduct me to my chaise?"</p>
<p>He held himself very hard, to play the considerate, to show
naught but solicitude for her. He smiled ingratiatingly, and heaven
alone knew what that smile cost him in such an hour.</p>
<p>"In a moment, if you will," said he. "Though I still hope that
you will not."</p>
<p>"'Tis a very unreasonable hope, my lord," said she.</p>
<p>"Will you not sit?" He advanced a chair. "A glass of wine?"</p>
<p>She declined one and the other by a gesture. "There is no reason
why I should linger. I should not have come at all but for your
positive assurance that the pardon would be in your hands tonight.
I&mdash;I would I had not trusted to your word," she ended, displaying
the first sign of weakness.</p>
<p>"You have no cause to say that," he reproached her very gently.
"I have fulfilled my part. I have done all that I promised, and
tomorrow when his Majesty's signature shall have been appended to
the document, Sir John will be released. You cannot, surely, doubt
me?"</p>
<p>"If I doubted I should not have said that I shall return
tomorrow. You understand, my lord&mdash;I have sought to make it plain
to you&mdash;that this is a bargain between us; and when you perform
your share, I&mdash;I shall be ready to perform mine."</p>
<p>He turned from her a moment, biting his lip in his vexation. He
was nonplussed, hard-driven. A postponement was impossible.
Outside, Mr Suarez and his bailiffs watched and waited. Unless this
marriage took place tonight he was wrecked and ruined for all time,
beyond all hope.</p>
<p>What, he wondered in a frenzy of stifled rage, could have
induced Lord Carteret to play this scurvy trick upon him&mdash;to
withdraw that shielding warranty thus, in the eleventh hour?</p>
<p>He whipped a handkerchief from the silver-laced pocket of his
coat, and mopped his clammy brow. The heat seemed to increase; the
air of that summer night had grown more stifling. Suddenly,
outside, there was an ominous rustle of wind among the laurels and
a moment later the candle-flames in the room were beaten over by
the draught.</p>
<p>"Damaris," he said presently, "you use me very cruelly. Can
nothing that I do win me back the place I held in your regard? the
place from which a moments folly made me outcast? I love you,
Damaris!" His voice shook with emotion; he was very humble,
entirely the suppliant lover; and he was a very handsome and
gallant figure of a man. "There is naught in all this world I would
not do to pleasure you, no sacrifice I would not make to win your
regard&mdash;no sacrifice, I swear, whatever it may be."</p>
<p>But he failed to move her. Not by his humility, nor his
protestations, nor yet his personal beauty could he achieve it. She
was but the husk she had proclaimed herself. She stood silent for a
little moment, so that her words might not seem a direct and
offensive reply to his appeal. Then: "I will go now," she said, and
again she begged him to ring for a servant to escort her to her
waiting carriage.</p>
<p>His manner changed on that. He had tried humility, and since
that had failed with her, she should see him in his real mood. He
had been a suppliant; but since she had no ear for his entreaties,
she should listen now to the proclamation of his will.</p>
<p>"Nay," he said quietly, coldly almost, and he smiled, but no
longer ingratiatingly. "Nay, Damaris, you are here, and here you
stay. Take off your cloak, child."</p>
<p>Alarm gleamed in her eyes. Faintly her bosom began to stir. It
seemed, then, that she was not quite the insensible thing she
accounted herself.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" she asked him, her voice straining a
little.</p>
<p>"You promised to come hither and wed me tonight if I obtained
you Sir John's pardon. I have obtained it. Tomorrow it shall be in
your hands, if you require it. For that, however, you must take my
word."</p>
<p>"Your word?" she cried, a world of scorn in her tone.</p>
<p>"My word," he answered firmly. "You came hither to become
Viscountess Pauncefort, and Viscountess Pauncefort shall you be
within the hour. All is ready and the parson is waiting. So take
off your cloak."</p>
<p>She felt herself turn a little dizzy. The room seemed to sway
about her, and one word boomed and reverberated through her mind.
"Fool! Fool! Fool!" was that word. "Fool"&mdash;to have trusted herself
alone into the house and power of such a man.</p>
<p>He strode over to the bell-rope and pulled it sharply. In the
distance a tinkling note was heard. "I will not!" she cried. "Let
me depart!" And she turned to the door.</p>
<p>He sprang after her, and seized her wrist. Through the open
windows came a sound of heavy raindrops pattering on the
leaves.</p>
<p>"Listen, Damaris," he implored her, his face now within a foot
of hers, awakening horror and sickly dread in her. "There!" he
cried suddenly. "You hear the rain. There is a storm coming. You
cannot go on such a night as this is like to be." Even as he spoke
a vivid flash of lightning illumined the terrace and the gardens
beyond it. "The very elements conspire to make you mine at
once."</p>
<p>"I will not marry you until the pardon is in my hand," she
answered, with a brave attempt to steady her voice. "Not even then,
if you attempt further to detain me now."</p>
<p>"You will not?" he said, and gently seemed to mock her. "Very
well! But depart you cannot. You see, there is a storm." And his
mockery increased. "Be it as you will. Do not marry me until you
have the pardon. But for your own sake I suggest&mdash;no more&mdash;that it
were better you married me tonight than in the morning."</p>
<p>"Do you threaten me?" she cried, and wrenched herself free of
his clutch.</p>
<p>"Threaten you? Nay, sweeting, I do not threaten. I warn. I
admonish. Assume that by morning, wearied by your cruelty, I change
my mind. Assume that I then no longer desire to marry you. What
then, eh?"</p>
<p>She looked at him, and there was utter loathing now in her
glance. He saw it; perceived that in his desperate haste he was
playing his game clumsily; wherefore, being rendered still more
desperate, he plunged recklessly on to issue his ultimatum.</p>
<p>"Nay, now," said he, "I swear to heaven that unless you marry me
this night, Sir John's pardon shall be cancelled. I'll not be toyed
with in this fashion. You shall not blow hot and cold upon me at
your pleasure, mistress."</p>
<p>She put her hands to her face an instant; then looked at him
again.</p>
<p>"You are a dastard, my Lord Pauncefort," she told him.</p>
<p>"I am a lover, madam," was his answer. "Choose now, and advise
me of your choice. Shall Sir John go the way of Captain
Gaynor?"</p>
<p>Overhead at that moment came a terrific crash of thunder, and
instantly the pattering rain was changed to a torrential
downpour.</p>
<p>"Here is the storm," said he. "Perhaps it will help you to a
wise decision."</p>
<p>The door opened and the servant summoned by the bell stood to
receive his lordship's orders.</p>
<p>"Bid them," he ordered, "put up Miss Hollinstone's chaise."
There was terror now in her face, the terror of the trapped
creature.</p>
<p>"Very good, my lord."</p>
<p>"And&mdash;wait." He turned to her again. "Shall we have the parson
in or not?" he asked her. "'Tis as you please."</p>
<p>But she swung round to the servant. "No, no!" she panted. "I am
departing now. Take me to my chaise."</p>
<p>Bewildered, the lackey looked at his master. Behind Damaris,
Pauncefort was signalling the fellow to depart. He did so
instantly, closing the door after him.</p>
<p>At bay now, she turned once more upon her captor. "My lord," she
said, "you dare not do this thing. I will not marry you now or
ever. You do well to show me from what I have escaped. Let me
depart! Let me depart at once, or you shall suffer for it as there
is a law in England."</p>
<p>"You'll be none so eager to depart in the morning," said he. "As
for the marriage, I use no coercion. If you will not, you will not.
Yet tomorrow you may sing in a different key, my sweeting." The
mask was off him now. He was frankly brutal and menacing.</p>
<p>She fronted him intrepidly. "You shall rue it, my lord," she
promised him with conviction. "Terribly shall you rue it."</p>
<p>"Rue what?" he mocked her, with false pleasantness. "Rue it that
I could not commit the inhospitality of suffering a lady to ride
forth in so wild a night? Come now," he added, with an attempt at
rough good-humour, "think better of it, Damaris. See, here comes
the parson. Do not send him empty-handed away."</p>
<p>She heard the door open behind her, supposing, as did his
lordship, that it was the parson who now entered. She did not turn,
but using his lordship's countenance as a mirror, she realised that
in the doorway at her back stood not the parson but some unexpected
and terrific apparition.</p>
<p>She saw Pauncefort's whole body twitch convulsively, his flushed
face turn livid, his mouth fall loosely open, whilst his eyes
bulged and bulged as he stared past her at that something in the
doorway. Some of his unutterable horror communicated itself to her,
so that she dared not turn to look behind her, but stood there with
aching head and throbbing pulses, waiting for this thing to reveal
itself to her senses.</p>
<p>And then, after a long pause, that revelation came. It was borne
to her by a voice&mdash;a pleasant voice that rang now with sinister
crispness, a voice at whose sound her heart leapt wildly and seemed
to stand still, whilst a great fear took possession of her; for
surely it was the voice of one who was dead.</p>
<p>"For a man engaged in villainy, Pauncefort," said that voice,
"you are singularly careless of your doors. I had not hoped to find
so easy an admittance."</p>
<p>Pauncefort answered nothing. He continued to stare, wide-eyed,
at the ghost of the man who, by his agency, had been hanged at
Tyburn a fortnight since. But Damaris staggered as the voice
ceased; she uttered a little moaning sob, and swayed there until a
strong arm came suddenly about her waist to steady her. The voice
spoke again, in her very ear now and scarce louder than a
whisper.</p>
<p>"Be not afraid, Damaris. 'Tis I."</p>
<p>She looked up at last, fearfully, to meet the gleaming eyes of
Captain Gaynor. Although she had known what vision to expect, yet
the sight of it almost drew a scream from her. But she controlled
herself. All this was a dream, she knew now, the bitterly ironical
conclusion of a nightmare.</p>
<p>Then Pauncefort found his tongue at last. "In God's name, who
are you?" he cried, in a quavering voice.</p>
<p>"Captain Henry Gaynor&mdash;at your service," said the apparition. "I
think I am as opportune as unwelcome," he added, smiling.</p>
<p>At last my Lord Pauncefort awoke to the realisation that here
was no apparition from beyond the tomb, but a living man;
formidable, perhaps, and damnably inopportune, yet to be dealt with
in human fashion and at once.</p>
<p>By what miracle the Captain had been preserved to present
himself at such a season was a matter whose explanation could wait.
Meanwhile, for the second time that night his lordship's hand stole
to his side, where his sword should have hung, and for the second
time he cursed its absence.</p>
<p>Captain Gaynor observed the gesture, and smiled his
understanding.</p>
<p>"That shall be amended presently," he said, with meaning. "There
was a foul game we played one night a month ago at your house in
town, my lord. We played it with cards, and fortune favoured you&mdash;a
cheat. We will resume that game in a moment, my lord, and it shall
not be played out with cards this time."</p>
<p>He felt Damaris tremble as she lay against him, supported by his
arm. She, too, was beginning to realise that this was not the dream
she had supposed it, but an amazing reality; that the heart that
beat just where her shoulder rested was the heart&mdash;the living,
throbbing heart&mdash;of one who was believed to be dead.</p>
<p>"Besides," Captain Gaynor was continuing, "I have another score
to settle with you. It seems that you have been giving my
honourable name to a Jacobite rascal known as Captain Jenkyn, who
was hanged at Tyburn, and on the strength of that spurious identity
you foisted upon me, you procured the arrest of Sir John Kynaston
for having harboured me."</p>
<p>Pauncefort leaned heavily against the table. He understood
nothing. His amazement effaced for the moment every other
consideration.</p>
<p>"But that," Gaynor resumed, "is a matter upon which Sir John
himself is here to question you."</p>
<p>"Sir John?" Pauncefort muttered, despite himself.</p>
<p>"Sir John is here?" exclaimed Damaris, too.</p>
<p>"Why, yes. When I presented myself to Lord Carteret today, my
presence was in itself sufficient to reveal the absurdity of the
charge against your uncle. He was instantly released, and since I
was informed by my Lord Carteret that you were to be coerced into a
marriage here tonight, upon certain false pretences of this
trickster, we came straight hither from town, bringing with us an
old friend of mine, in case we should require support. I left them
in talk with a parson. But I think they are here now."</p>
<p>And as he spoke they entered, Sir John first and Sir Richard
Templeton close upon his heels.</p>
<p>And now Pauncefort understood at last the thing that ever since
the admission of Mr Suarez had been plaguing him: the reasons that
had led my Lord Carteret to withdraw his warranty. Plainly, seeing
Captain Gaynor alive and hearing him disclaim all connection with
that Captain Jenkyn who had been hanged, the Secretary of State had
concluded that he, himself, was being imposed upon. Whatever else
remained impenetrable to Pauncefort, at least he realised to his
dismay that not all the protesting in the world could now induce
Lord Carteret to think otherwise; that not all the proof that he,
himself, might produce, could stand against the overwhelming,
self-evident fact that whoever Captain Jenkyn might have been, he
was not Harry Gaynor.</p>
<p>Sir John took in the situation at a glance. "Ha!" said he. "I
gather from the parson that we arrive in good time. Damaris, my
dear child, this was&mdash;a little wild in you&mdash;I mean, to trust this
villain." Then he turned to the viscount. "Pauncefort&mdash;" he began,
and there he ended. Abruptly he turned his shoulder upon the
fellow. "Pshaw!" said he. "To what end recriminations? Let us
begone, Harry."</p>
<p>"If you will take Damaris," said the Captain, "and Dick will
remain, I have yet something to say to his lordship, a&mdash;a little
game to conclude."</p>
<p>But Damaris suddenly swung round and clutched his arm, looking
up fearfully into his face.</p>
<p>"No, no, Harry!" she pleaded. "Leave him! Let us go! Come with
us."</p>
<p>Upon that my Lord Pauncefort spoke at last. "If he is the coward
I deem him," he said, in a voice that choked with rage, "he will
give heed to you."</p>
<p>"You hear him, sweet," said Captain Gaynor, with his wry
smile.</p>
<p>"And is your courage a thing that can be blown upon by the
breath of such a man as that?" she asked him. "Oh, Harry, I have
suffered for you&mdash;you can never know what I have suffered. You are
restored to me, I know not how. I understand nothing. My senses are
all confused. But I understand that you are here and alive.
Presently I shall thank God for it, and seek to understand the
nature of this miracle. Meanwhile, my dear, I ask this of you. 'Tis
the first thing I have ever asked of you. If you love me, Harry,
you will come with us now."</p>
<p>"Not a doubt," sneered Pauncefort, "but he'll shield himself
behind a woman's plea."</p>
<p>"It seems to me," said a fresh voice, a rich, oily voice, "t'at
my Lord Pauncefort is so ill-advised as to seek to pick a
quarrel."</p>
<p>They swung round, startled. In the doorway now stood Mr Israel
Suarez. Behind him loomed the shadows of his three bailiffs. He
bowed to the company.</p>
<p>"Forgive my intrusion, madam and gentlemen. But it is timely. My
lord's life is vort' fifteen t'ousand pounds to me&mdash;to be obtained
t'rough veary years of vaitin'. I cannot permit 'im to jeopardise
it."</p>
<p>"And who the devil may you be?" quoth Sir John.</p>
<p>"My name, sir, is Israel Suarez. Ye may 'ave 'eard of me. I 'old
a varrant for t'is 'andsome young nobleman, who is my debtor and
cannot meet 'is debt. I am sorry, gentlemen, to interfere, sorry to
baulk you of a very vorthy object, sir" (this to Captain Gaynor),
"but my lord belongs to me; 'e belongs to t'e law; 'is life is
sacred; and if knowing t'at, 'e persists in insulting you,
vhy&mdash;codso!&mdash;'tis to 'is greater shame. In fifteen years or so, it
is possible t'at I may 'ave done vit' 'im. Your little affair must
vait until t'en. T'e first satisfaction must alvays belong to t'e
law."</p>
<p>"Ha!" said Sir John. His blue eyes twinkled. He turned to
Captain Gaynor. "I think his lordship will be quite safe with Mr
Suarez."</p>
<p>"Quite," said the Captain, who understood now to the full what
Lord Carteret had said. "Though I think he would have found me more
merciful. Shall we be going, Damaris?"</p>
<p>"In God's name, yes!" she sobbed.</p>
<p>With a dull roar of anger Pauncefort sprang after them. The
towering bulk of Mr Suarez rose suddenly before him, an insuperable
barrier.</p>
<p>"Be calm, my lord; be calm," said the moneylender affably "'Tis
but a lost trick in t'e game of life. Patience, t'en! T'e gods love
a good loser."</p>
<p>Pauncefort fronted him a moment, cursing foully; then, exhausted
and sobbing, he collapsed into a chair.</p>
<p>Over him stood the benign Suarez, like a protecting but very
proprietary deity.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>It was Sir John who proposed that as the night was wild and the
roads becoming difficult the party had best divide itself, since
they had two carriages&mdash;the one which had brought Damaris and the
other in which Captain Gaynor and his friends had come to town.
That proposal was well enough, but when in his further proposal for
the division of the party he sent Damaris and the Captain ahead in
one carriage and himself followed with Sir Richard in another, he
showed a very culpable and reckless disregard of the
proprieties.</p>
<p>Said Damaris to her Captain: "You are regretting the
intervention of that man," by which she meant the intervention of
Mr Suarez to avert the meeting between the Captain and his
lordship.</p>
<p>"Nay, sweet," he answered her, "I am glad on't. It made it
easier for me to follow my heart, and do your bidding."</p>
<p>"You confess, then, that you hesitated?"</p>
<p>"If I did 'twas because his life was a menace to me and to
others. But gaoled and discredited as he is, his fangs are drawn
and we may now be easy on that score. I think we are the more
sweetly avenged, and&mdash;and my hands are not soiled."</p>
<p>"There is much I don't understand! so much!" she said.</p>
<p>Thereafter he explained.</p>
