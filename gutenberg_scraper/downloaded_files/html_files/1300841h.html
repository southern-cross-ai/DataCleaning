<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1">CHAPTER I</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE LION had Sheena cornered. An old lion, scarred
and shaggy, his yellow eyes flat and still, and only the tip of his
tail moving; an old lion but still dangerous. He held both Sheena
and Chim, the monkey, at bay in a triangular niche in the rock.</p>

<p>Chim stirred whimpered a little, and Sheena, without taking her
eyes from the lion, said, "Quiet. Be still."</p>

<p>She spoke calmly, keeping herself rigid.</p>

<p>Sheena, of course, hadn't quite foreseen this emergency. She had
crossed a clearing, on her way to a water hole where she might find
antelope for food. There had been lions in the tall grass about a
hundred yards away, hardly a thing to trouble Sheena, Queen of the
Jungle. She had walked right past them, downwind. It was late
afternoon, and by late afternoon most lions have full bellies,
especially when they lie quietly in the sun.</p>

<p>But the old lion had not yet fed.</p>

<p>"Run&mdash;this way!" she'd cried to Chim. There was a kopje
ahead; a rocky hillock perhaps thirty feet high.</p>

<p>She might have loosed arrows at the beast then and there, but
she knew that the slim shafts would be uncertain loosed so quickly,
and at a moving target. Possibly they could climb it in time to
leave the lion behind. Or at the very least he would hesitate, be
still, and make an easier target before he entered the niche.</p>

<p>The lion, however, came right along, and the moment she was in
the niche she realized there was no time to scramble upward. She
whirled and faced the beast.</p>

<p>Now it took a step forward, and Sheena saw that it was a limping
step. She glanced at its left forepaw and saw the porcupine quills
and the nasty swelling. She understood, then. A lion never learns
about porcupines and is unable to resist them; then, with a paw
full of quills he is unable to chase the swifter beasts. This is
when he seeks the weaker, two-legged creatures.</p>

<p>Sheena smiled just a little. She began to make a soft, purring
noise. The lion cocked its head, puzzled. Slowly, deliberately, she
slipped her bow of nahete wood from her shoulder. She reached
across the other shoulder and plucked an arrow from her quiver.</p>

<p>The shot would have to count. The small arrows hadn't the
shocking power of a spear or bullet and the first one would have to
pierce the heart. If it didn't&mdash;well, there was one more
chance; she would use, then, the ivory hilted Arab poniard at her
side.</p>

<p>These were Sheena's weapons, these and her quick senses and her
jungle wisdom. With these the orphaned daughter of a white explorer
had grown up among the beasts and natives of the steaming Congo to
become undisputed Queen of the Jungle. She was already a familiar
sight to many tribes and wild things. They saw her as a tall, slim,
bronzed young goddess, striding through the lion grass with her
head and shoulders held high, or making a golden blur against the
green jungle as she sped through the treetops. Her leopard-skin
clung to her torso, showing every graceful curve. Armbands,
earrings and light bracelets of pure gold were her decorations,
although she would have been beautiful enough without them.</p>

<p>Now she laid the arrow carefully to the bow. The lion's eyes
flickered: in the next instant it would spring.</p>

<p>Sheena drew the bow quickly and effortlessly until the head of
the arrow touched the wood. There was a dull snap. It wasn't at all
the sharp twang of the arrow flying away&mdash;the string had
broken. The arrow dangled limply in her hand.</p>

<p>Chim, in terror, cried out: "Chee-chee-chee-chee-chee!"</p>

<p>The lion sprang.</p>

<p>Sheena leapt, too, twisting herself violently in mid-air. She
came down upon the lion's back, facing forward. She whipped the
long Arab knife from her side.</p>

<p>Holding the knife with thumb and forefinger she began to plunge
it into the beast's ribs just behind its left shoulder. She was
striking for the heart&mdash;if only she could hold on long enough.
The lion plunged and clawed and made terrifying screams of rage,
but she hooked her knees around its body and held firmly to its
mane with her free hand.</p>

<p>The lion, bucking wildly, slammed into the rock wall of the
niche just as Sheena had her knife drawn back for another blow.
Sheena's hand struck the rock. The tip of the knife was caught for
an instant against the granite, and as the lion came down again the
weapon was knocked from her hand.</p>

<p>She grasped the lion's mane quickly with her other hand and hung
on even more tightly. She glanced at the lion's flank and saw that
it was stained with blood. Perhaps in a moment he would tire, and
fall to his knees. Perhaps his heart had already been pierced.</p>

<p>GLANCING from the corner of her eye she saw that Chim had
scrambled to the top of the kopje now and was standing there
jumping up and down and chattering. Then she saw her fallen arrows
there in the point of the niche.</p>

<p>"Chim!" she cried. "The arrows!"</p>

<p>The monkey chattered and jumped up and down again.</p>

<p>Sheena pressed her lips together. Sometimes Chim would
understand, and sometimes he wouldn't. And then if he did
understand, like as not he'd forget what he started out to do
before he was halfway there.</p>

<p>"Arrows, Chim! Arrows!" she cried again. She released her hold
long enough to point to them.</p>

<p>Chim glanced down, then up again. He looked puzzled.</p>

<p>The lion tried to bite and claw the two-legged thing on its
back. Sheena yanked its mane in the other direction each time it
did that. Yet she knew she couldn't keep this up forever. The
powerful king of beasts would probably have more endurance than
even Sheena, whose smooth, spring-steel muscles could carry a
full-grown man up a ngoji vine and into a treetop.</p>

<p>"Arrows, Chim!" she called sharply.</p>

<p>Chim scratched his head, scrambled half way down the rock face,
then stopped, then looked at the arrows that had fallen from
Sheena's quiver during her twisting leap, then looked up at Sheena
again.</p>

<p>There was a sudden twang!</p>

<p>As if by magic an arrow appeared in the lion's flank, inches
from Sheena's own shoulder. The beast whipped about viciously to
bite at it. His legs became suddenly unsteady. He stumbled.</p>

<p>Sheena whirled her eyes toward the top of the rock; the arrow
had come from that direction. She saw no one. She frowned. She had,
in this moment, a curious flash memory of another time when someone
had saved her life by shooting an attacking lion&mdash;only that
had been with a bullet, not an arrow. She had been facing this
charging beast with only her knife, a rifle had cracked twice, and
it had died in midair. Then a white man had stepped into view; he
had called himself Rick Thorne. Not like other white men she'd
known: he was tall, and his hair was black as the wing of a raven,
and his eyes were gray mist. He had awakened a strange feeling in
her. Since then she had roamed many jungle trails with Rick Thorne,
but at the moment he was in the far Bilina country taking the
tribe's yearly bag of ivory tusks back to civilization for them. It
seemed he had been gone much too long, and lately Sheena had been
wondering whether or not to head in that direction.</p>

<p>Then, abruptly, the lion fell and rolled to its side. Sheena
leapt free. The beast shuddered, its hind legs twitched several
times and after that it was dead.</p>

<p>Chim, chattering for all he was worth, and grinning with peeled
lips, came running to Sheena with one of the fallen arrows in his
hand.</p>

<p>She shook her head sadly, trying not to grin. "I don't need it
now, you fool," she said.</p>

<p>She remembered the arrow out of nowhere then and glanced quickly
at the top of the rock. A head came slowly over the edge and into
view. It was grinning. It belonged to a black man with huge cheeks
like ebony apples and three or four fat chins. He wore the claw
headpiece of a sub-chief.</p>

<p>Chim saw the newcomer and immediately set up a racket.</p>

<p>The black laughed. It was a rich, deep laugh that came from his
immense depths. He pointed to the monkey. "The white girl," he
said, "has more courage than her little brother!"</p>

<p>There was no malice in the remark. A joke like this meant
friendly intentions. Sheena smiled back and said, "Chim is not
afraid. He only means to protect me from strange-looking creatures
that appear!"</p>

<p>The fat man roared with laughter. He slipped heavily over the
edge of the rock and with many grunts and groans began to let
himself down.</p>

<p>Chim began to imitate the grunts and groans.</p>

<p>"Quiet, Chim," said Sheena. Then to the black, "You speak the
tongue of the Bilina."</p>

<p>He was facing her now, and still grinning. "It is so. I am
K'ando, sub-chief of the Bilina. And you are Sheena."</p>

<p>She raised an eyebrow. "How did you know?"</p>

<p>He waved his fingers, which were fat but nevertheless tapered
and graceful, and said, "Even the waves of the two far oceans know
Sheena."</p>

<p>Sheena smiled then. "And you have saved Sheena's life. Sheena
owes you a debt."</p>

<p>"There is a way to pay that debt," said K'ando. "In fact, I
sought the Queen of the Jungle in many kraals before I was sent
this way."</p>

<p>"Oh?" said Sheena quietly, and waited.</p>

<p>K'ando dropped his eyes. "There is great trouble among my
people, the Bilina." He half-chanted in his rich, deep voice as he
talked. "Do you know of the Spirit Men?"</p>

<p>She thought. She had heard rumors of the Spirit Men from time to
time, although she had never actually met them. They were a secret
group, with members scattered at odd places, something like the
Leopard Society that once terrorized all of Africa. They were
supposed to know all the secrets of magic. "What of the Spirit
Men?" she asked.</p>

<p>"They are among us," said K'ando gravely. "The son of our chief,
Poko Na, returned from a long visit to far places where he learned
some of the white man's ways, but also found the evil of the Spirit
Men. Now he and the warriors of the society take much tribute,
especially in ivory. As you know the Bilina's lands have long since
become fruitless of grain or cattle, and the tribe lives only by
its ivory, the finest of any. Because of the Spirit Men, many are
weak, many starve among the villages."</p>

<p>"But what can I do to help?" asked Sheena.</p>

<p>K'ando frowned. "I have no plan. Yet, the name of Sheena is
known to my people, and they think of Sheena as a white
goddess&mdash;one of magic, herself. Perhaps in some way we can
make the magic of Sheena stronger than that of the Spirit Men."</p>

<p>Sheena had a sudden thought. "The white hunter, Rick Thorne; has
he left the country of the Bilina, yet?"</p>

<p>"He was waiting for the ivory to be gathered when I left," said
K'ando. "There was but a small carry this year, and he remarked
upon it."</p>

<p>Sheena looked up for a moment at the hot, endless sky and the
high clouds.</p>

<p>"Sheena thinks," said K'ando.</p>

<p>"Yes." She nodded slowly. "Sheena thinks that some magic,
perhaps, is the work of spirits. Not that of witch doctors, of
Spirit Men, but the magic of the jungle itself. Sheena has seen
strange things. Sometimes there is a strange feeling in one's
stomach, and this feeling seems to warn not to take a certain
journey."</p>

<p>"Sheena has such a feeling now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said slowly. "It is very difficult to know."
And then abruptly she smiled and tossed her blonde tresses and
said, "I will go with you, K'ando. Together we will see what we can
do about these Spirit Men."</p>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2">CHAPTER II</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">RICK THORNE moved through thick jungle, taking a
short-cut to the broad river that few white hunters would have
dared. He had found a game trail that most eyes would have
missed&mdash;it was merely a place where the jungle was a little
less tangled. A big Tawani black of his safari moved ahead of him
hacking the way with a bush knife. About twenty porters trailed
along behind. A dozen of these carried ivory, a tusk apiece. The
tusks were all huge and magnificent, hard and white to the core,
such as the famous Bilina ivory was always known to be. Each year
at this time the Bilina sent a shipment of ivory to the coast,
trusting only Thorne to deal with them, and then put the proceeds
into the tribal funds. They were paid partly in money, but mostly
in trade goods, and with these they bought food and cattle and
other necessities from their more fortunate neighbors with better
land.</p>

<p>The Bilina country was on a long, arid slope that climbed to a
mountain range; it was difficult to find, even more difficult to
traverse and only white hunters such as Rick Thorne had ever seen
it. Most of Rick's fabulous jungle craft, as a matter of fact, had
been developed on long treks with Sheena. He looked around him a
bit, and half-wished that the Jungle Queen were along right
now.</p>

<p>It was too quiet, Rick was thinking. The rustle of the breeze in
the treetops had stopped; the homing parrots were no longer
squawking; it seemed as if the very insects had stopped buzzing
around his head and shoulders.</p>

<p>He turned, glanced at the blacks, and saw that they were staring
about them uncomfortably, too.</p>

<p>"Hurry. Faster step!" Rick called to them easily. He hoped to
make a certain swampy watering before dark. He was only two marches
from the head Bilina village now, having left early that morning,
before the worst heat of the sun. A few hours beyond the village he
had entered the jungle: it was hot and damp here under the trees,
but at least the direct rays of the sun didn't beat down upon the
head and shoulders.</p>

<p>The head boy turned around, swept his bush knife at the trees
and said, "Juju bikitelo, bwana!"</p>

<p>Rick felt like smiling but he didn't. Nor did he chide the black
for saying that spirits and magic were gathering; he'd long since
learned not to scold or scoff at such feelings. He agreed instead.
He said in the same Congolese dialect: "Aiee, the magic gathers.
But if we are fast we may escape it before nightfall."</p>

<p>The others whispered about this among themselves for a moment or
so, and then decided to push on. The head boy began hacking at the
brush again.</p>

<p>Rick kept looking all about him, staying alert&mdash;but he did
this easily and with little motion so the others wouldn't be
alarmed. He had to admit that he, too, felt something odd in the
air. Something more than the heavy quiet&mdash;something that
wasn't seen or heard, but made the backs of his hands prickle. Not
spirits, of course, but perhaps just as worthy of attention. Rick
had walked the bush long enough to know that there are such things
as instincts and premonitions.</p>

<p>The trail thinned out presently. The columns of sunlight came
through the mottled jungle roof at a sharper slant, and the life of
the jungle took on the unreal quiet of the late Congo afternoon.
Suddenly, almost without warning, the small safari entered a swampy
patch where the trees were less thick and grew from patches of
black water. A startled frog, the size of a small dog, leaped from
a rotting log with a great splash, and a dark brown watersnake
slithered out of the way inches from Rick's foot.</p>

<p>He turned. He smiled and held up his hand for the halt. "We have
made good speed. Here we rest for the night!"</p>

<p>The porters, grinning back, started to dump their tusks.</p>

<p>A shot and ricochet knifed into the thick silence. A chip of
bark flew from the tree just beside Rick at the level of his
head.</p>

<p>"Down!" Rick yelled at the porters.</p>

<p>He followed his own advice. He threw himself flat in the next
instant, and in the same motion arced the Mauser rifle to his
shoulder. He rolled so that it pointed in the direction of the
shot. Across the swamp, where the jungle came again to its edge, he
could see a feather-scarf of gray smoke drifting. He held his
sights firmly waiting for something to move.</p>

<p>But instead of seeing anything, he heard something. It was a
loud, high-pitched voice and it spoke English with a trace of some
accent he couldn't quite place. "Sorry, old man!" it called.
"Didn't see you with the beggars at first! May I show myself?"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" Rick called angrily.</p>

<p>"Lavic's the name. Ferdinand Lavic&mdash;just hunting through
here." And then a tall, barrel chested man in bush khakis stepped
out from the trees. He held a bench-made Mannlicher-Schoenauer
diagonally across his front. He wore a rakish South African felt
with the brim fastened to the crown on one side and his laced
cordovan boots were polished like mirrors even here in the deepest
jungle. He was perhaps forty years old. His face was rough-hewn,
reddish and pock-marked; he wore a sandy mustache brushed upward at
the ends, and his eyes were a fierce, bright blue.</p>

<p>Rick got up. "You should be more careful where you shoot that
fancy gun of yours," he said.</p>

<p>Lavic, coming forward now, laughed. "Forgive me, my friend. This
jungle has been getting on my nerves. We haven't seen any game
since we left the river."</p>

<p>"We?"</p>

<p>"The Countess Narcissa and myself," said Lavic. He tilted his
head. "We've a small camp a mile or so from here, where there's a
little stream. I should be honored if you would share dinner with
us. And your name, sir?"</p>

<p>"Rick Thorne," said Rick. He kept looking at the man who called
himself Lavic. He had decided that the man was either a hopeless
roineck in the bush, or here for something other than hunting. This
wasn't game country, at all; a man was lucky to find water buck for
his porters in this part of the jungle. Rick said, "I can't delay
very much. I'm anxious to get down-river before the rains set
in."</p>

<p>"I assure you, Mr. Thorne, we won't delay you. We have some
boxed India tea that might tempt you. And&mdash;"</p>

<p>The newcomer stopped talking suddenly. His restless eye had
caught sight of the tusks lying on the ground.</p>

<p>"Ivory," said Rick, with faint sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Yes, I should say it is!" Lavic's eyes had widened. He stepped
forward, knelt, ran his hands over one of the tusks and
whistled.</p>

<p>"You seem to know good ivory when you see it," said Rick.</p>

<p>Lavic stood up and was all smiles again. "Oh, I dabble in
collecting things, you know. I've a surface knowledge of ivory and
jewels and that sort of thing."</p>

<p>Rick smiled. "You know your jungle pretty well, too, I'd say.
You can tell those other people to come out of the bush and stop
covering you, now."</p>

<p>Lavic's smile disappeared. His face fell. It was as though a
mask had dropped&mdash;for just an instant there was evil etched
deeply in that expression. Then once more he became affable. He
made a half-bow. "I must congratulate you on remarkable eyesight,
Mr. Thorne. No offense, of course, just ordinary caution." He
turned back to the spot where he had appeared and called, "All
right, Narcissa."</p>

<p>A WOMAN, accompanied by three blacks stepped into the clearing.
This time it was Rick who felt like whistling. She was perhaps
twenty yards away, but even at that distance he could see that she
was remarkably beautiful. She was dark; her skin was olive. She had
jet black hair pulled tightly around her head and fastened in the
back. She wore a felt like Lavic's, with a soft veil of mosquito
netting hanging from one side and swept under her chin to the
opposite shoulder. Her loose khakis couldn't conceal her lithe form
and graceful, almost catlike way of walking.</p>

<p>"Narcissa," said Lavic, half-bowing again, "permit me to present
Mr. Rick Thorne. Mr. Thorne, this is the Countess Narcissa."</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Thorne." Her voice was deep, throaty, and
she was coming toward him with her hand extended. She wore dark red
fingernail polish. It reminded Rick of a leopard's talons stained
after a kill. "Please forgive our excessive caution, Mr. Thorne. We
shot because we glimpsed only your blacks, and thought they might
be hostile natives." Her voice had even more of an accent than
Lavic's, but again, Rick couldn't tell just what sort of an accent
it was.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Rick. "It's one of those things." He
took her hand, and it was firm, but ice cold. She smiled
provocatively as she withdrew it.</p>

<p>Lavic said, "You will have supper with us, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes. All right," said Rick. "And thanks." He would have
preferred the company of his own blacks and the jungle, but these
were, after all, other whites, hundreds of miles from nowhere and
it seemed courteous to accept.</p>

<p>"Look at the extraordinary ivory Mr. Thorne has acquired, my
dear," Lavic said to the Countess.</p>

<p>She swept toward one of the fallen tusks. She knelt and stroked
it. Rick half expected her to purr.</p>

<p>"It's not my ivory," Rick said. "I'm just taking it in for the
Bilina. They make a yearly shipment of the stuff, and that's the
only way they exist."</p>

<p>"The Bilina?" said the Countess. Somehow, her tone struck Rick
as a little too innocent.</p>

<p>Rick said, "I'll tell you all about them on the way. We might as
well head for your camp now. It gets dark quickly around these
parts."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," she said, smiling.</p>

<p>Rick turned to his porters and gave them the new directions.
They frowned, as they shouldered the heavy tusks again, but as
usual didn't question a decision of Bwana Rick's. Behind him Rick
heard Lavic muttering to his own three blacks, but he didn't pay
much attention to that just then. Moments later the whole party was
swinging along a second game trail, with the big Tawani hacking the
way in front, and Rick was telling Lavic and the Countess about the
Bilina, and their yearly ivory shipment which they got from some
mysterious source.</p>

<p>They hadn't been walking for five minutes when Rick noticed that
only two of Lavic's natives were present. He frowned. "Where's your
other boy?"</p>

<p>"Other boy?" said Lavic, innocently.</p>

<p>"There were three when the Countess came into the
clearing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, quite. Of course." Lavic spoke hastily now. "I sent
one ahead to announce our coming. Warn the camp guards, you
know."</p>

<p>Rick looked at Lavic sharply but the man's face was blank. Rick
couldn't quite decide whether he was very shrewd or very foolish.
He walked through the jungle with a kind of military
stride&mdash;shoulders thrown back and bristling mustache thrust
forward&mdash;and there was a suggestion of decadent aristocracy in
his manner. Only it wasn't quite real; it didn't quite ring
true.</p>

<p>Rick had dropped back a little now so that he paced along beside
the Countess Narcissa. She smiled warmly at him. "I should think,
Mr. Thorne," she said, "those huge ivory tusks would be a
temptation."</p>

<p>"You mean to steal them from the Bilina?" He laughed. "Even if I
wanted I wouldn't be able to sell them. The government regulates
that."</p>

<p>"But there are ways to go beyond regulations, yes?"</p>

<p>"I suppose there are. I haven't made a study of it. I've spent
most of my time in the jungle."</p>

<p>"Ah, then perhaps you have seen the elephants from which these
tusks came. They must be tremendous beasts!"</p>

<p>Rick shook his head. "I doubt if any white man's ever seen them,
or ever will. As far as I can gather they're in some sort of a
hidden valley that only the Bilina know about."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I had heard a rumor to that effect," said the
Countess. Rick glanced at her and saw that she was looking ahead
with a deeply thoughtful expression. She looked at him abruptly.
Her dark eyes flicked back and forth, searching his face. She
lowered her voice. "It is possible, is it not, that a man such as
yourself, who knows much of the jungle, could find this hidden
valley?"</p>

<p>Rick shrugged. "I might get to it. I don't mean to try,
though."</p>

<p>"But with wealth like that you could have everything you wanted
in the finest cities of the world. Perhaps you might want to form
a&mdash;a partnership with someone amusing and pleasing to you. I
am not unattractive, am I?"</p>

<p>This time he looked at her in slight surprise.</p>

<p>She laughed at him. "Why be shocked? I may be a countess but I
have to live, like anyone else. I prefer to live well if I can. I
am not above using any natural charms I may have in order to do
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this point Lavic dropped back a little bit, possibly
suspicious of the Countess's lowered voice. He grinned at her
wolfishly, and then at Rick. "The Countess," he said, "always finds
new guests interesting."</p>

<p>She ignored him and strode along with her face perfectly
blank.</p>

<p>Rick sniffed campfire smoke in that moment. The trail widened
here. Ahead he could see the pyramided sticks and gasoline drums
converted to kettles that always marked a safari stop. He noticed
vaguely that Lavic had moved to his side and was pressing closer. A
sudden chill of instinctive warning went through him. This, too,
wasn't quite right, not any of it&mdash;</p>

<p>Deafening volleys came suddenly from the foliage on both sides
of the trail. It all happened in an instant. There were scattered
blossoms of flame, each throbbing for a moment against the
deepening jungle gloom, and there were rolls of gray smoke across
the trail. Rick whirled and saw his porters dropping and catching
themselves. He knew, in this same split second, that Lavic was
responsible for the ambush.</p>

<p>He whirled toward Lavic. The big man, at the first sound of the
shots, had already jumped at Rick, and now he grasped the Mauser
rifle with both hands and attempted to wrest it away. Rick twisted
it violently but Lavic hung on. He pulled the fancily dressed
hunter off balance, so that they slammed together. Lavic was heavy
and hard. It was Rick who stumbled backward. He bent his knees
suddenly, and Lavic sailed over him, but the rifle was wrenched
from both of them and fell with a thud to one side.</p>

<p>RICK leapt to his feet and turned, and saw that Lavic, behind
him, had done the same thing. The two men faced each other now,
looking for an opening. Lavic's mask of friendliness was gone and
there was a cold, concentrated greed in his expression. Both men
wore sidearms, but there was no time to draw. In the moment before
Lavic rushed, Rick glimpsed the natives who had fired upon them and
were leaping from the foliage into the trail now. He saw that they
were dressed in shorts and singlets, like askaris, and that each
one carried a cheap carbine and an ammunition belt slung crosswise
over his shoulder. Lavic, then, had brought his own little army
into the Bilina country. Men didn't bring armies with them just to
do some big game shooting.</p>

<p>Lavic came swinging. His arms were like massive cranes sweeping
through the air. Rick ducked under the first blow and sent a hard
jab to Lavic's midsection. There was slabbed muscle there; Lavic
withstood the blow easily. Rick tried to slip a quick uppercut at
the man's jaw but Lavic drew his elbows in and blocked it.</p>

<p>Then one of those wild swings landed. It struck Rick on the side
of the head, making flashing lights appear before his eyes; making
the jungle rock back and forth. Rick stumbled, and was going to
rise again, but saw another sledgehammer blow coming his way and
barely managed to dodge it. He slammed his shoulders into Lavic's
knees then. Lavic went down. Rick scrambled to a crouching position
and leapt, coming down upon Lavic spreadeagled. He straddled Lavic,
braced his knees, and began to hook and slug, feeling the shock of
his own blows in his wrists and knuckles as they landed. Lavic
began to get glassy-eyed.</p>

<p>Suddenly, strong, rough hands pulled at Rick's shoulders. He
turned. Several askaris apparently had finished their slaughter of
the porters and were turning to him now. He tried to tear himself
away, tried to pull from their grasps and get to his feet again to
face them. It was no use. They snatched him from Lavic as if he had
been a rag doll and worried him to an upright position.</p>

<p>Rick kicked and struggled like a madman. At one point he did
actually break free, but they closed in on him again. Moments later
they had him pinned to the ground. It took four of them to hold him
there.</p>

<p>Lavic loomed over him now. Lavic was smiling, but not
pleasantly.</p>

<p>Rick looked at him levelly and said, "So you're nothing but an
ivory poacher, eh, Lavic? You don't think you'll get away with
this, do you?"</p>

<p>"But of course I will get away with it, my friend," said Lavic,
laughing. "No one but us will ever know it happened. You see, it's
a kind of insurance. I'm not certain I will find this hidden valley
where the huge tusks come from, but at least I can return with this
little shipment of yours. It will pay for some of the trouble and
expense I've undertaken."</p>

<p>So that was why Lavic was in the Bilina country, thought Rick.
Somehow he must have heard of the hidden valley, and the giant
elephants there, and reasoned correctly that if a man could bring
back as few as fifty of those tremendous tusks he would have a
sizeable fortune. And Lavic, as the Countess had suggested,
probably knew how to market them without running afoul of the
authorities. There was only one puzzling question. "How did you
know the Bilina had a hidden valley where their ivory came from?"
Rick asked.</p>

<p>Lavic smiled. "When one knocks around the world as I have done,"
he said cryptically, "one makes friends."</p>

<p>"And enemies," said Rick, staring at him flatly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But I'll not worry about you, Mr. Thorne."</p>

<p>"If you're thinking of killing me," said Rick, "I wouldn't
advise it. A lot of people know me in the territory. If I don't
show up on schedule with that shipment of ivory a lot of people are
going to start looking for me. If I'm found murdered they'll hunt
you down wherever you are."</p>

<p>This time Lavic laughed hugely. He turned to the Countess and
said, "He underestimates me, does he not?" The Countess was
frowning thoughtfully. Lavic looked at Rick again. He shook his
head. "No, my friend," he said, "I'll not be so crude as to shoot
you. That would be messy, no? What I have in mind is very simple. I
will tie you firmly to one of these large trees with rawhide. You
will starve, or perhaps fall prey to some marauding beast. But by
the time you are found the rawhide will have rotted away&mdash;it
doesn't last very long without care in the damp jungle. Thus you
will simply be found dead and with no evidence that you were
forcibly detained. What do you think of that? Rather clever, is it
not?"</p>

<p>Rick didn't answer. Nothing to do now but save his strength, and
hope for a break of some kind.</p>

<p>Lavic turned abruptly to his askaris and barked a series of
harsh orders.</p>

<p>A moment later they had propped Rick against a thick-boled bambo
tree and were winding strips of rawhide firmly about him. Rick said
nothing. Not even when the rawhide bit more tightly than necessary
here and there did he make a sound.</p>

<p>The Countess stepped up to him, looked at him for a moment, then
shrugged. "I am sorry," she said. "Ferdinand is right, of course.
It is necessary we have your ivory in case our other plan fails.
Too bad we must leave you like this but that is the way things
sometimes happen, eh?"</p>

<p>Rick still didn't answer. Or change his flat expression. But now
that he could no longer depend on the Countess having change of
heart or mind, he felt that his last slim hope was suddenly
gone.</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3">CHAPTER III</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IT WAS near sundown when Sheena, Chim and the fat
sub-chief, K'ando, entered the main village of the Bilina. The
shadows behind the huts and stakes of the stockade were long; the
light over everything was reddish and faintly unreal. The Bilina
warriors were drawn up in ranks on either side of the central
clearing, for the drums had told of Sheena's and K'ando's approach,
and the Bilina had made ready to welcome them.</p>

<p>Sheena strode, as always, with her shoulders thrown back and her
head held high. There was queenliness in her every step. The
warriors she passed sensed this somehow, and held themselves a
little straighter. They were tall warriors, these Bilina;
magnificently formed and without the usual scars and tattoo marks
to mar their fine bodies. They carried shields fashioned of strips
of the famed Bilina ivory; their spears were broad-bladed,
glistening and sharp; they wore plumed headdresses that added
another foot to their height.</p>

<p>At the end of the clearing another tall native sat in a kind of
insolent sprawl on a hassock covered with leopard skin. Even at
this distance Sheena could see that his eyes were steady upon her.
They were deep-set coffee-black eyes, and they seemed to lurk in
caves cut into a face chiseled out of black granite. This man wore
two sidepieces of miniature ivory tusks which started at his
headband and curved down along the sides of his cheeks like sharp
fangs.</p>

<p>K'ando, only a step behind Sheena, whispered to her. "It is Poko
Na&mdash;head of the Spirit Men who waits to greet you. This is
bad. Only the Paramount Chief should greet Sheena&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sheena nodded, strode forward a little more and then abruptly
Poko Na lifted a hand, palm outward. His voice was shrill but
penetrating. And to her surprise he spoke English, clipped, Oxford
English that sounded doubly incongruous coming from this
barbarously decked savage. "Sorry," he said. "You'll have to stop
and kneel. Proper sign of respect, and all that. Quite necessary to
maintain my position with these savages."</p>

<p>Sheena took only a moment to raise her eyebrows in surprise,
then recovered herself quickly. With subtle contempt she answered
in Bilina dialect, rather than English. "Sheena," she said, "asks
no one to bow to her. Nor does she bow to anyone."</p>

<p>Now Poko Na raised his eyebrows. "Dear, dear," he said. "I'd
hoped you wouldn't be stubborn, you know. I'm afraid I must insist.
And if you refuse&mdash;" He glanced toward the warriors lined up
on either side.</p>

<p>For an answer Sheena kept walking forward.</p>

<p>"Kaa-ti! Lai-e-te!" Poko Na barked at the warriors. His command
was directed to four exceptionally tall blacks who flanked him.</p>

<p>They jumped toward Sheena. Sheena moved so quickly that she was
but a blur. She leapt forward and met the first of the warriors
before he was halfway to her. He never had a chance to raise his
spear. She bent swiftly, slammed her shoulder blades into his
middle and then, grasping him by the legs and neck, swung him up on
her shoulders. She spun three times, her feet twinkling gracefully
as in a pirouette. At the end of the third spin she let the big
warrior fly from her shoulders and slam horizontally into the next
two, bowling them over.</p>

<p>The fourth warrior stood there, surprised, hesitant. In a
half-hearted way he raised a spiked club, as if to throw it.</p>

<p>Sheena scooped the first warrior's fallen spear from the ground.
She grasped it near the blade with her hands slightly apart, took a
few running steps and chunked the haft into the ground. Her own
momentum carried her up and forward, as in a pole vault. She swung
her feet forward as she sailed thus through the air, and her heels,
close together, slammed into the fourth warrior's jaw, making an
audible crack!</p>

<p>He staggered backward, then fell.</p>

<p>Sheena dropped lightly to her feet, whirled, and raised both of
her arms. All of it had taken only several seconds, and the
remaining warriors were gaping in surprise. "Hear, Bilina
warriors!" she cried. "Sheena comes only to help, and never in
anger! A great magic protects Sheena. There is only death and
sorrow for any who would harm her!"</p>

<p>The blacks looked at each other nervously and several muttered
among themselves. Sheena turned to face Poko Na again. He was
smiling. "Very good, indeed, Sheena. Let us say you have
won&mdash;this round, at least. I don't choose to make an issue of
the matter right now."</p>

<p>"You show wisdom," said Sheena, with just an edge of
sarcasm.</p>

<p>Poko Na turned to the left and clapped his hands. Several blacks
went scurrying off to the area behind the huts. "You must be tired
from your journey. We will feast. Then you may tell me why you have
come to call. Although&mdash;" and here he glanced at
K'ando&mdash;"I daresay I can guess."</p>

<p>Another leopard-skin hassock was brought for Sheena and she sat
there, waiting patiently, while Chim hopped to her shoulder and
glared at Poko Na to whom he'd evidently taken an instant dislike.
A moment later women and older men began to appear from behind the
huts carrying long handled dipper cups made of hollowed bamboo
trunks. Each of the warriors was handed one of these&mdash;and
Sheena noticed that they drank avidly. They gulped the stuff, then
threw the cups away haphazardly for the women and old men to pick
up.</p>

<p>Poko Na saw her watching and smiled. "Kaffir beer, you know,
such as you find at any kraal. But with a slight difference. I
spike the stuff with millet alcohol. They're forbidden to go near
the little distillery I've set up out there in the jungle. They
think I've some magic power that makes the beer into a 'drink of
courage' as they call it. Clever, what?"</p>

<p>Sheena met his eyes. "Yes. I suppose it is clever. And I suppose
there's a reason behind it."</p>

<p>"There might be," admitted Poko Na cheerfully. "Hardly your
affair, though, is it?"</p>

<p>"What happens to the Bilina, or any other tribe, is always
Sheena's affair," she said levelly. "K'ando's told me how you've
organized a group of Spirit Men within the tribe, and how they
exact tribute from the others. I don't like that."</p>

<p>"You are rather meddlesome, aren't you?" said Poko Na, meeting
her stare. "I'd heard of Sheena before I returned&mdash;some rather
foolish missionaries provided for my education, you know&mdash;but
frankly I didn't expect this sort of interference."</p>

<p>"Speaking of interference," said Sheena, "where's the paramount
chief?"</p>

<p>Poko Na looked pious. "He met with a most unfortunate accident
in the jungle. Leopard, we believe."</p>

<p>"You murdered him," she said flatly.</p>

<p>Poko Na smiled, but didn't answer.</p>

<p>"And who becomes chief now?"</p>

<p>"Nominally, your friend, K'ando," Poko Na said. "But he can't
receive the kaross of his office until the next full moon."</p>

<p>"That will be in a few days."</p>

<p>"Yes. Quite. And, of course, quite a lot can happen in a few
days, can't it?"</p>

<p>"I see," said Sheena. One of the women set a steaming bowl of
maize pudding before her, but she made no move to touch it. She
kept looking at Poko Na. "Another question. What of the white
hunter, Rick Thorne, and the tribe's shipment of ivory? Has there
been any word?"</p>

<p>"A messenger will return here and report when he reaches the
river," said Poko Na. Then he smiled just a little mysteriously and
said, "If he reaches the river."</p>

<p>IT WAS clear to Sheena by now that much was going on behind the
scenes; some of it she could guess, and some of it she could only
wonder about. That Poko Na meant to rule the tribe in one way or
another was pretty evident. Apparently, while the paramount chief
still lived, he had been unable to stop the shipment of ivory that
he was to take to the coast. But Sheena was convinced that Poko Na
had no intention of letting that ivory reach the coast, and the
tribe derive the benefits of its sale. It was her guess that Poko
Na meant to get for himself all the wealth of the tribe, and then
leave the jungle and return to civilization with his new
fortune.</p>

<p>While Sheena was thinking of these things there was a sudden
clamor at the gate of the stockade yards behind her. The warriors
all turned their heads that way and Poko Na rose. Sheena turned.
Two old men who acted as gatekeepers were swinging the big portals
back, and as they did so a tall warrior, glistening with
perspiration staggered in. He was panting. He made his way directly
to Poko Na, knelt, spread his hands out before him and kept his
head down.</p>

<p>"Speak!" Poko Na commanded.</p>

<p>"White men approach, O Spirit Chief!" said the black. He pointed
to the northwest. "We saw them from the Hill of Drums, followed by
porters and askaris, crossing the Yellow Plain."</p>

<p>"They come this way?" Poko Na was frowning.</p>

<p>The black shook his head. "They move toward the sacred
mountains."</p>

<p>Poko Na swept his eyes over the clearing, his brows still
knotted in thought. Finally he looked again at the messenger and
said, "Tonight I ask the spirits. They will advise."</p>

<p>Sheena and K'ando at this point traded glances. Something wrong
here&mdash;normal behavior would have been for Poko Na to form a
war party and investigate the newcomers immediately. Sheena herself
glanced momentarily at the open gate and then when she looked at
K'ando again she saw that the fat sub-chief had read her mind. He,
too, obviously thought an investigation of this white man's safari
would be a good idea. Only it was probable that Poko Na for some
reason might not care to have Sheena leave and make such a
reconnaissance.</p>

<p>She decided not to wait for Poko Na's permission.</p>

<p>Just as the messenger was rising to back away respectfully
Sheena moved. She sprang from her hassock almost too quickly for
the eye to follow&mdash;certainly too quickly for the warrior's
brains to react. She snatched a spear from one of Poko Na's
personal guards, raced the length of the clearing, her blonde hair
streaming out behind her, and Chim clinging precariously to her
neck. The gatekeepers recovered from their surprise in that moment
and started to swing shut the big bamboo portals. Sheena, still
running, threw the spear. It passed between the closing gates,
frightening the gatekeepers and making them pull away to either
side. She heard Poko Na's harsh voice calling out behind her:
"Close it! Fools, close the gate!" But it was too late. She had
already reached the gate and was passing through the slim aperture.
Spears fluttered in the air. The edge of the jungle was just ahead,
and only a few steps away a hanging ngoji vine led to the leafy
heights of a giant tree.</p>

<p>She sprang, curved gracefully through the air, and grasped the
vine. Using her hands alone she sped upward, Chim still hanging on
for dear life, and a moment later disappeared in the thick foliage.
She raced through the treetops then, leaping, swinging, running
along the sturdier branches, and a few minutes later the shouting
of the Bilina warriors, the Spirit Men, was far behind.</p>

<p>But another sound caught up with her. Before another minute had
passed she heard the excited pock-pock-pock-pock-pock of war drums
and then, ahead of her, another sort of drumming, low and rumbling
thunder. She glanced several times through clear spaces in the
treetops and saw the boiling cloud ahead, rising high over a patch
of jungle. It was one of those swift evening thunderstorms that
begin just before rainy season. She saw that she would have to pass
through it to make her way to the sacred mountains.</p>

<p>RICK felt the first cold splashes of the rain on his cheeks and
he raised tired, heavy-lidded eyes and looked up. He could see only
mottled patches of the sky through the leafy roof of the jungle,
but he saw now that these mottled patches were gray. The sunlight
shafts had disappeared. It was becoming darker. Lightning flashed
suddenly, throbbing in a great ghostly sheet for only an instant,
then disappearing again. Seconds later the thunder came. It crashed
and rocked like a stampede of giant buffalos through the jungle.
Rick raised his lips hungrily to the rain. They were parched and
cracked by now, and his tongue was swollen. He had spent a long
night, and then a hot, steaming day lashed to the tree here.
Through the night, and during the first few hours of the morning he
had managed to stay awake, keeping himself as still and calm as
possible and conserving his strength. He knew it was hopeless to
struggle in his bonds. Hanging on to consciousness, and to life
itself, was the only thing he could do.</p>

<p>Before the morning was half gone, however, the grayness and then
the blackness had descended. At one part of the day the moving sun
had sent a baking shaft of heat down upon his head, making it throb
so painfully that he awoke for a while.</p>

<p>But here was water&mdash;life-giving water&mdash;pouring upon
him. His head cleared. New strength surged through him and his
vision stopped being fuzzy.</p>

<p>He heard an insane laughing sound to his right. He whirled his
head in that direction. Hyenas. The ugly, striped beasts were
feeding on the bodies of the porters Lavic's ambush had shot down.
They would rip and tear at the dead flesh, snarling, quarreling
with each other, and gorging themselves as if they would never have
another meal in their lives.</p>

<p>Once one of the larger beasts turned his head, curled his bloody
lips and bared his fangs for a moment at him. He knew he would be
safe as long as the feast there in the jungle trail lasted.</p>

<p>He shuddered at the sight of their shoddy manes and ugly,
hump-backed bodies. Then he felt a queer, soft movement of the
bonds holding him to the tree. Puzzled, he glanced down. The
rawhide was beginning to be slippery with the rain that soaked
it.</p>

<p>Sudden hope surged through him. The rain would stretch the
rawhide&mdash;maybe enough for him to work himself free. The bonds
seemed somewhat looser already. He strained against them with his
whole body, bracing his back and heels against the tree, and they
did slip a little&mdash;but not quite enough yet to release him. He
had to get out of them somehow, now, because if he stayed here
after the thunderstorm went away the rawhide, drying, would shrink
with a steel grip and crush him to death!</p>

<p>He renewed his efforts. He was weak and numb, but somehow he
made himself press with a demon's strength on the rawhide
encircling him. He groaned once with the pain of the effort. He bit
his lips and blood trickled down his chin.</p>

<p>Again one of those insane, hysterical barks of a hyena. Rick
looked that way. The big beast who seemed to be the leader of the
pack had taken several steps toward him and was staring at him
quizzically. His ugly black nostrils were twitching. The animal's
remarkable sense of smell had detected the fresh blood on his chin.
Watching the beast's eyes, and its very movements, he could almost
read its mind. Here was something with the hated smell of the man
thing wounded, which didn't move. Which seemed to be helpless and
might be eaten. But still, the man-smell meant always that there
should be caution.</p>

<p>Rick became suddenly as still as possible. The hyena moved
forward a few steps more, cocking its head and snuffling softly
this time. Its belly was already distended with food, but the hyena
is one of the few jungle beasts who will gorge himself whenever
possible, even to the extent of eating himself into a stupor. Rick
tried to breathe so easily that the rise and fall of his chest
wouldn't show. This was difficult, with his heart pounding at his
ribs. For Rick had a plan: a long chance that might or might not
work.</p>

<p>The rain was still falling. Beyond the thickness of the jungle
it came in a steady downpour, but under the leafy roof it came in
scattered streams, where leaves and branches caught it and sent it
pouring. The rawhide was definitely stretching now. Rick could feel
the circulation returning to his wrists and ankles, prickling
painfully. Now, as he watched, the hyena's snout came forward and
sniped at the rawhide. Rick didn't even dare move his eyes.</p>

<p>Abruptly a faint sound came to his ears. It was muffled, and
partially blanketed by the hushed roar of falling rain, but it
seemed to come from the treetops somewhere to his left, and it was,
he swore, a sound he had heard before. A familiar sound. To most
ears it might have been simply a cry of a jungle crane. Certainly
it was intended to sound like one. But there was an individual tone
to this cry&mdash;one that Rick, if he heard rightly, recognized.
It was Sheena's call; she used it to summon Chim without announcing
her own presence.</p>

<p>Hu-eeeee&mdash;weeeee! He heard it again, louder, nearer, and
unmistakably Sheena's.</p>

<p>At this moment the hyena slashed viciously with its fangs. It
bit deeply into the rawhide, weakening it. Rick made a sudden
effort, straining until his temples throbbed&mdash;and the bonds
parted. He fell away from the tree. His feet and ankles were numb
and he was completely unable to stand.</p>

<p>At Rick's first movement the hyena had been startled, so that it
jumped back with the sparse hairs on its humped back bristling. Now
it glared at the helpless man-thing and laughed hideously. Saliva
drooled from the corners of its mouth. It edged forward again.
Others of the pack, seeing their leader, trotted over too.</p>

<p>Rick lifted his head. From his lips then came the shrill cry of
a jungle crane: Hue-eeeee&mdash;weeee! The beasts retreated again,
but only for a moment. In that moment there was the sound of the
rain and the thunder now distant&mdash;but no answer to Rick's
signal.</p>

<p>The hyenas came forward once more.</p>

<p>"Get! Go on!" Rick shouted at them; this time they paid no
attention. They kept coming. "Hueeeeee&mdash;weeee!" He made the
cry again&mdash;a little desperately now.</p>

<p>THE largest of the hyenas was already upon him. He could feel
its fetid breath, hot in his face. He struggled to rise, but his
legs were without strength, and the needles of blood returning to
circulation were sheer agony. He knew he wouldn't be able to get
away. His hands, too, were stiff from the tight rawhide that had
held them to his sides for so long, but now the only thing left to
do was to try to use them. He raised them, to clutch at the hyena's
throat. The other hyenas started to gather around, snarling and
making hysterical, yapping noises.</p>

<p>A slim, tawny figure came down from the treetops abruptly.
Sheena! Her limbs glistened with the jungle rain and even as she
struck the ground she began to slash about with her Arab
poniard.</p>

<p>The hyenas screamed, and tried to scuttle away. Sheena picked up
the largest of them bodily and threw him at the others. Seconds
later, the carrion-eaters had disappeared completely, and only then
did Sheena turn to Rick.</p>

<p>Sheena did not have the civilized habit of wasting words. She
smiled just a little, knelt quickly by Rick's side. She searched
Rick's smoky-gray eyes and said, "Tell me what happened?"</p>

<p>Briefly he sketched in his adventures since leaving the Bilina
village with the load of ivory and Sheena's eyes roamed about as he
talked, seeing the rawhide strands, and the spoor all about, and
confirming his report by sight. She nodded when he had finished.
She told him then how K'ando had come to her for help, and how they
had found Poko Na in power at the village. "When the safari was
reported&mdash;and that would be your friends, Lavic and the
Countess," said Sheena&mdash;"he failed to call for a war party.
There was something wrong in that."</p>

<p>"Yes." Rick was frowning thoughtfully. Chim had appeared by this
time and was at the moment greeting Rick by nibbling softly at his
ear and mussing his hair. Rick chuckled and stroked the monkey.
Then he looked at Sheena. "Lavic seemed confident he'd find the
hidden valley where the big tusks come from. He wouldn't be that
sure unless he had some help in the tribe itself."</p>

<p>Sheena nodded. "This was also my thought."</p>

<p>"We can't let him get away with this, Sheena. There are some
things in the jungle that are best left hidden. If we allow one man
to invade, others will follow."</p>

<p>"True." Sheena nodded again.</p>

<p>"Besides," said Rick, "I've got a score to settle with that
fellow Lavic." The feeling was returning to his limbs now and he
was able to rise shakily. The thunderstorm had passed, but darkness
was falling. In the very tops of the trees some of the leaves were
turning a soft yellow in the light of the fat, waxing moon rising
over the forbidden mountains to the east.</p>

<p>"Lavic crosses the Yellow Plain now," said Sheena. "I was on my
way to look upon his safari, to see what I might learn."</p>

<p>"We will do it together then," said Rick. "Only I'm afraid I'd
better eat first&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sheena smiled briefly, then rose abruptly and said, "Wait here."
Before he could answer she had turned and disappeared as if by
magic into the jungle. A minute later he heard the sharp twang of
her bow. And the minute after that she appeared holding a small
antelope by the hind legs.</p>

<p>When Rick had eaten and felt stronger they set out through the
jungle toward the big plain, using the method they had employed on
a hundred forest trails. Sheena led the way by the treetop route,
calling from time to time to keep Rick in touch, and Rick pushed
through on the ground, taking to the treetops himself only when the
underbrush became too thick for passage. The moon was already far
above the horizon when they finally emerged upon the sloping plain
that led to the jagged mountains.</p>

<p>Here Sheena climbed a high tree and looked all about. There was
enough moonlight so that her sharp eyes would detect any moving
thing larger than a jackal upon the plain. When she came down again
she was wearing a puzzled frown. "Rick," she said, "there is no
safari in sight."</p>

<p>"That's strange," he said. "Maybe they've already reached the
mountains and found a camp for the night."</p>

<p>"They haven't had time to reach the mountains. If they had
struck a camp their fire would be visible."</p>

<p>Rick scratched his head. "Well, they were real enough when they
ambushed me and slaughtered my porters."</p>

<p>He was standing by a large bush which had long-pointed, reddish
leaves and from which hung a bulbous, pale yellow fruit. He reached
for one of the bulbs absent-mindedly, plucked it, and brought it to
his mouth.</p>

<p>Chim started abruptly to chatter madly. He leapt at Rick. He
knocked the fruit from his hand, then jumped up and down excitedly
on his feet and knuckles.</p>

<p>"Hey! Chim!" said Rick. "Don't you want me to have dessert?"</p>

<p>Sheena bent swiftly and took the fruit from the monkey's hand.
She glanced at it, then up at Rick. She smiled a bit. "You'd better
thank Chim," she said quietly. "He's just saved your life."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>She handed the fruit to him. "Karatonga. Quite a bit of it grows
around here. Witch doctors slice and dry the bulb, then make powder
they use to poison their enemies. Chim, like all monkeys, has an
instinct for these things. Long ago, when I could still be lost in
the jungle, I made a habit of following tribes of monkeys and
baboons and eating only what they touched&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rick, smiling, turned to Chim, bowed and said, "My apologies,
old boy." Chim grinned by peeling his lips back over his teeth,
hopped up and down again and said, "Chee! Chee! Chee! Chee!
Chee!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Rick, turning to Sheena again. "I guess the thing
to do is cross this plain now and make a good search for Lavic and
his slinky girl friend."</p>

<p>Sheena looked thoughtful, shook her head and said, "There's a
better way. K'ando knows every inch of this country. He told me
that as a boy he even found the way into the hidden valley. This
may be where Lavic and his safari has disappeared. We'll do best to
get K'ando now and then look for these people in the morning."</p>

<p>"Lead the way," said Rick.</p>

<p>Before they were within a mile of the Bilina village Sheena and
Rick knew something was wrong&mdash;very wrong. They could see the
red light flickering upward from the stockade, tinting the sky
above it, and they could hear the throbbing of a symphony of drums.
The smaller drums made a swift patter, which played against the
slower, heavier booming of the signal logs.</p>

<p>"Go slowly and keep to the shadows," Sheena warned Rick.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">SHE left his side abruptly and swung into the
treetops, with Chim scurrying after her. Moments later she squatted
quietly at the crook of a branch in a towering jungle giant
overlooking the stockade. Here the drums were sharp and savage in
her ears. Several huge fires in the center of the clearing threw
everything into a flickering crimson light. The Bilina warriors
were in two shuffling lines, dancing hypnotically back and forth to
the drums. But tonight, instead of wearing mere warrior's dress,
each was clad in a rough imitation of some animal: there were
jackal capes, leopard heads, buffalo horns, elephant
tusks&mdash;the variations were endless. Poko Na, a sarcastic smile
on his thin lips, sat again on his hassock at the end of the
clearing.</p>

<p>The warriors were chanting softly. Sheena caught just enough
words to understand that this was a ceremony of the Spirit Men, and
that the spirit of the animal he imitated was supposed to dwell in
each warrior. As she watched, the drums stopped again and
frightened women made haste to dip the bamboo cups in the vat of
kaffir beer by the main hut. They ran with their libations to the
warriors, who gulped, and then continued to dance.</p>

<p>She whispered to Chim, "He's not exciting them like that without
reason."</p>

<p>Chim didn't understand, but he nodded and grunted just as if he
had.</p>

<p>Her eyes darted all around the clearing now, searching for
K'ando's bulky form. It wasn't anywhere. And then she saw the two
guards standing before the entrance to a small hut on the other
side of the village, near the plaintain grove. She could guess the
rest. K'ando would oppose Poko Na in whatever he was up
to&mdash;and Poko Na had taken care of that by imprisoning K'ando,
probably on some flimsy excuse.</p>

<p>There was the soft chirping of a tree frog below her and Sheena
knew Rick had reached the spot under her tree. She scrambled down
again. "K'ando's been imprisoned," she said softly and quickly.
"Here's what we'll do." Swiftly she outlined the plan.</p>

<p>It was most strange, that which happened in the village of the
Bilina that night. Poko Na, Chief of the Spirit Men, suspected the
cause of it all&mdash;but he couldn't very well air his suspicions
to the others. That would have shaken their faith in him.</p>

<p>It started when the Leopard Warrior stepped into the clear space
between the two shuffling lines to do his solo dance. No sooner was
he in the clear, and scarcely had he taken three steps when the
unearthly scream of a leopard came from the quiet, dark jungle.</p>

<p>The drums stopped; everyone stared in the direction of the
cry.</p>

<p>"Play! Do not stop!" Poko Na roared at the drummers.</p>

<p>They started again; the Leopard Warrior finished and stepped
back into line.</p>

<p>The Buffalo warrior came forward. He began to shuffle. This time
it was the bellow of a wounded buffalo that sounded, startling
them.</p>

<p>Again the drums stopped, and again Poko Na shouted for them to
continue. But by now the warriors were staring fearfully at the
jungle beyond the stockade.</p>

<p>When the coughing roar of a lion greeted the Lion Warrior's
appearance it was just too much for them. And for Poko Na, too. He
was clearly shaken. He stood, pointed to the jungle and said, "Hunt
the beasts! Hunt them down!" The warriors gripped their spears and
poured from the stockade and began to beat the bush noisily. In a
high tree, Rick lowered his cupped hands that he had used to make
the lion cry, and grinned.</p>

<p>On the far side of the stockade there was a swift blur against
the dark jungle green and a slim figure clinging to a ngoji vine
sailed gracefully over the pointed logs and dropped into the
village. The two guards at the door of the prison hut barely had
time to turn and see Sheena. They opened their eyes in
surprise&mdash;and she was upon them.</p>

<p>She grabbed the first by the wrist, spun and threw him over her
shoulder. He struck the ground with a hard thud, knocking the
breath from him. The other drew his spear back to thrust it. Sheena
slipped in under the spear, grabbed it, and twisted it out of the
man's grasp. She kept her hold near the blade and swung the weapon.
The haft struck him in the temple, knocking him down.</p>

<p>There was no time to undo the rawhide knots that held the door
of K'ando's prison. Sheena slashed them with her knife. She kicked
the door in and saw the fat sub-chief standing there in the middle
of the hut, gaping at her in amazement.</p>

<p>"Come!" said Sheena.</p>

<p>He followed her, still half-bewildered. The ngoji vine still
hung limply at the stockade wall. Sheena somehow managed to help
K'ando take his huge bulk to the top of the wall, grasp the vine
and swing to the other side. He tossed it back to her then, and she
climbed it swiftly, then dropped lightly to his side.</p>

<p>She led the way and a moment later both of them disappeared into
the jungle.</p>

<p>The Spirit Warriors, some time later, returned empty-handed from
their hunt, and found the dazed guards and the open prison. Poko Na
was forced to agree that it was probably the work of dark forces,
and invisible things of the jungle night. But now he had resolved
that Sheena, when he caught her, would die. Such an able adversary
was much too dangerous to have around.</p>

<p>K'ando lost no time in explaining to Sheena and Rick what had
happened, and what he had now learned of Poko Na's plans. After his
rescue, and after the warriors had returned to the stockade the
three of them, with Chim, set out for the sloping plain and the
sacred mountains again. In deference to K'ando they took the route
that circled the jungle. He puffed along beside them, moving
quickly and with surprising grace on his fat little legs, and his
endurance never seemed to waver.</p>

<p>"He spoke freely with me, since he was sure I would die," the
fat chief told Sheena. "First he claimed that by bringing Sheena I
had angered the spirits, and that was the cause of the white man's
safari invading the land of the Bilina. Thus, I was imprisoned
until there should be a sign of guilt or innocence. Later, he
talked to me in the prison hut. Poko Na cares not for the
tribe&mdash;he wants only to have white man's riches so that he may
return to the white man's civilization and be powerful."</p>

<p>"I suspected as much," said Sheena.</p>

<p>"His plan is to take all of the Bilina's ivory from the hidden
valley that he can have carried. I know not exactly in what manner.
But he has made a pact with the white man you call Lavic, who even
now descends into the hidden valley."</p>

<p>Rick understood enough interior dialect to get the meaning of
K'ando's words and he said to Sheena, "That might explain how the
whole safari disappeared so quickly."</p>

<p>"Poko Na, himself," continued K'ando, "would be unable to sell
the ivory without having the government men ask many questions.
Lavic has greater wisdom in this matter, therefore he is necessary
to the scheme. Poko Na told Lavic the way here and the way into the
valley&mdash;the way you will also see presently. It is arranged
that Poko Na will lead the Spirit Men in a false attack upon Lavic,
and allow Lavic to escape with whatever ivory he has stolen by
then. In this way, none will blame Poko Na for the white man's
raid. That was why Poko Na made the dancing and the drinking of the
magic liquid longer tonight. Thus, Lavic will not be attacked too
soon. And when the attack does come, the warriors will be both
tired and drugged."</p>

<p>Rick glanced at Sheena dryly and said, "A man of Poko Na's
talent ought to do well in civilization."</p>

<p>They pushed on in silence for a while after that. Sheena frowned
thoughtfully all the time and Rick, who had been about to speak to
her on several occasions, kept silent. He knew from experience that
she was planning their next move now.</p>

<p>The walk through the grassy plain which was broken by
flat-topped camel thorn and little hillocks here and there, was
long and monotonous, and when the moon had reached mid-sky, Sheena
suggested that they halt and rest. "There will be many things to do
tomorrow," she added cryptically.</p>

<p>THE next morning they marched again, before the sun was high and
while the mists were still streaming from the lowlands on their
left. They had been moving diagonally across the plains all this
time, so that they had been ascending gradually, and were now
nearer the jagged mountains that grew like a vast crocodile spine
along the land.</p>

<p>They came presently to a low kopje that was crowned by a rock
outcropping which resembled an elephant's head with the ears
spread.</p>

<p>"This is the entrance to the hidden valley," said K'ando,
stopping.</p>

<p>Rick looked around. "Where?"</p>

<p>K'ando smiled, then scrambled with remarkable agility up the
side of the kopje until he came to the outcropping. He beckoned to
Rick and Sheena. They followed and then saw that a narrow cave
entrance was in the rock, artfully concealed by scrub thorn and a
hump of ground before it.</p>

<p>K'ando led the way. A long, dark passageway was before them and
presently even Sheena, whose eyes were used to the jungle night,
couldn't see their guide ahead. She followed the sound of K'ando's
soft footsteps. It seemed that they descended as they went along,
but Sheena knew this was an illusion of most tunnels. After a while
a spot of light showed ahead. They moved on, and the spot grew and
then Sheena saw that it was the other end of the tunnel.</p>

<p>They came out on a small rock platform perhaps half the size of
a planter's porch. Sheena stepped to the edge of it, looked down
and then drew in her breath sharply. She was atop a cliff that
dropped away for about a thousand feet.</p>

<p>She looked around behind her and saw that a thin ridge of
mountains blocked this place from the sight of anyone outside. She
knelt and stared again into the deep valley. There was lush foliage
below; it covered the floor of the basin like a thick carpet and
the color of it was a curious bright, poisonous green, not quite
like the dull green of ordinary jungle. Mists rose, too, and here
and there she caught the reflection of swampy water.</p>

<p>K'ando was examining the ground. He called to Sheena and when
she came over to him he pointed silently. The footprint of a heavy
boot was clear in the yellow earth. "The white man has passed this
way," said K'ando.</p>

<p>Sheena looked around. "But where has he gone?"</p>

<p>K'ando smiled then and waddled quickly to the other side of the
platform. He beckoned, they followed and presently saw a sturdy
bamboo contraption set in the ground behind a boulder. It was a
windlass, fashioned to hold a tremendous coil of vine-rope. The
rope led over the edge and Sheena saw that it was knotted at
intervals. K'ando said, "It is the only way in or out of the
valley. By this we descend, and by this we haul the tusks to the
top. The swamp below breeds huge elephants: many die and their
bones are found in many places. It is not as necessary to hunt and
slay them."</p>

<p>Rick, bending over the edge, looked down and frowned. "I can
just barely make out the bottom. Lavic and his pals don't seem to
be around."</p>

<p>"Exploring the valley, probably," said Sheena. "This would be a
good time for us to descend. If we can perhaps block their way out
of the valley we may be able to keep them from taking the Bilina
ivory." She turned to the chief. "Lead the way, K'ando."</p>

<p>He shook his head then. "It would be best if I return and watch
the village. From there I can spy upon Poko Na, and know what move
he is about to make next."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Sheena, nodding. "But Rick and I shall
return to help before another nightfall. How shall we find
you?"</p>

<p>"In the second village toward the place where the sun sets there
will be those who know my whereabouts," K'ando said. Suddenly he
brought his head up, then cocked it in an attitude of
listening.</p>

<p>"K'ando listens?" asked Sheena.</p>

<p>He frowned, wrinkling his mighty brows. "It seems that the drums
draw near. I cannot be certain." Then he smiled and shrugged again
and said, "Go now, my friend. K'ando will greet you again and share
meat."</p>

<p>When he had disappeared into the tunnel again, Sheena led the
way down the face of the cliff. Rick followed and Chim chattered
along behind. Chim didn't need the rope all of the way. Several
times he swung over and clung to sheer wall itself, chattering and
grinning, while Rick stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p>Sheena might have descended a little more swiftly but she held
her pace for Rick's benefit. When they were several hundred feet
below the edge the rope began to sway perilously with their weight.
"Hold tight," said Sheena.</p>

<p>The wind suddenly moaned and whistled along the cliff face and
tugged at Sheena as she clung to the knotted rope. But in spite of
the wind the air was warmer now. It was heavier, more sluggish, and
there was the beginning of a strange, thick smell, a blend of
rotting vegetation and stagnant swamp.</p>

<p>And now the mist thickened and they passed through a thin cloud
layer, and after a while they were at the level of the treetops.
Sheena looked around. The trees were unlike any she had ever known:
they didn't grow with solid trunks and sprouting branches, but
rather in thick clusters of fronds that spread out as they reached
upward. In effect they weren't trees at all; they were giant
ferns.</p>

<p>The earth was spongy and moist, so that it gave slightly under
Sheena's weight, and about a hundred feet out from the cliff she
saw that most of it was covered with swamp water. Here also the
jungle of great ferns began.</p>

<p>They heard the chunking of a bush-knife and the chatter of
askaris and porters some distance off to the left.</p>

<p>"The swamp," said Sheena, pointing.</p>

<p>She led the way down the short talus slope at the foot of the
cliff and into the thick growth of curious trees. There were little
ridges and islands of soft loam that provided places to walk. The
three of them faded into the dim, perfumed miasma of the place,
crowded behind one of the trees, whose trunk was covered with
crosshatched scales rather than bark. From here they watched
silently.</p>

<p>An askari came to the foot of the cliff first; the green-stained
bush-knife in his hand showed that he had been hacking the way. He
was followed by a line of fearful-eyed porters, each one staggering
under a tremendous tusk. It was clear that Lavic had found the
Bilina cache of dead ivory.</p>

<p>Now the askaris in their sketchy uniforms came along. Even they
were carrying tusks. As each tusk-bearer came to the foot of the
cliff he dumped his load with obvious relief near a large wicker
basket that was attached to the rope from the top.</p>

<p>Lavic and the Countess Narcissa were last. They were flushed,
smiling: this was a moment of triumph for them. Sheena's eyes
narrowed a little when she saw the Countess. With more than passing
interest she regarded the woman's lithe walk, her dark, smooth skin
and olive eyes, and the way she managed complete poise. Sheena
glanced at Rick and knew from his careful stare that he found the
Countess of more than passing interest. Her woman's instinct told
her that any man would. Sheena felt, without quite understanding
why, an intense desire to be locked in combat with this tigerish
woman&mdash;to battle by both wit and strength to overcome her.</p>

<p>But she pushed back that feeling and made herself concentrate on
the business at hand.</p>

<p>Lavic&mdash;his polished boots glistening wherever the mud of
the swamp hadn't touched them, strode to the pile of ivory,
gestured with a coiled whip and barked commands. The porters lifted
two tusks and placed them crosswise in the basket. Lavic pointed
upward then and called to another two. Immediately they sprang to
the rope and began to climb, one after the other.</p>

<p>Sheena whispered to Rick. "He will lift the ivory to the top
with the turning handle, then the rest will follow and leave the
valley."</p>

<p>Rick said, "Suppose we attack them."</p>

<p>"No attack," whispered Sheena quickly "I've a better plan."
Easily and silently she slipped the nahete wood bow from her
shoulders and fitted an arrow to it. Then she turned and peered
into the greenish swamp behind them. She pointed, "You and Chim
must go further back so they won't find you if they start
looking."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" Rick asked.</p>

<p>She shook her blonde tresses. "No time to explain now. Move
quickly."</p>

<p>Rick shrugged, took Chim by the hand, and picked his way for
another hundred feet or so into the swamp. Glancing back before he
moved off he saw that Sheena was clambering swiftly up the tree
with the scaly trunk. A few feet further on she was out of sight.
But there was another tree here in the swamp that seemed easy to
climb, a twisted, spiraling growth that was like a giant vine. Rick
mounted this, beckoning Chim to follow. In the upper branches that
bent and swayed under his weight, he found he could see Lavic's
party and the pile of ivory by the basket elevator, and he could
see the tree near the edge of the swamp that Sheena had
climbed.</p>

<p>There was a faint movement in the foliage to Rick's right. He
turned his head and found himself looking at a reptilian head
swaying atop a long, undulating neck. It was bigger than a horse's
head. Sharp teeth, like a crocodile's, overlapped the folds of its
mouth. Its eyes were small, cold and beady.</p>

<p>Rick's jaw fell. He couldn't quite believe it even as he saw it
there in front of him. It was unquestionably a saurian monster that
should have been extinct for several million years!</p>

<p>The monster's jaws parted, showing double rows of sharp, jagged
teeth and the feverish pink lining of its mouth.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5">CHAPTER V</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">FERDINAND LAVIC straightened his shoulders a bit
and smiled very slightly, so that he himself could enjoy the smile
without seeming to show the weakness of good humor to his porters
and askaris. He looked at the first two tusks which had been loaded
in the basket, and then at the larger pile of tusks beside it.
Magnificent tusks. Most of them at least twice as large as the best
teeth of even the Tala Forest in Rhodesia. Scattered along the
coast, and in the ports of North Africa, there were crooked Greek
and Arab dealers who would rub their hands over this
contraband.</p>

<p>Lavic turned to the Countess. He used his thumb to brush up the
ends of his mustache; a gesture that had now become second nature
to him. "I've been thinking, my dear," he said, "about this cheap
medicine man, Poko Na."</p>

<p>The Countess smiled. "I suspected as much. I daresay you began
wondering how to double-cross him from the first minute he told us
about the ivory."</p>

<p>Lavic chuckled. "We understand each other." He picked up her
hand, patted it, and then frowned a little at the quickness with
which she drew it away. His eyes narrowed. The Countess,
apparently, was getting tired of him. He had no illusions about
her. Given a chance she would double-cross him as quickly as both
of them double-crossed everybody else. But on the whole, it was
better that way; where there were no foolish expectations from
friends, there were also no disappointments.</p>

<p>"Well, then," she said finally, "have you decided what's to be
done about Poko Na?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Rather ingeniously, too, I think you'll admit." He stroked
the mustache again. He spread his boots as he stood, posturing.
Lavic always vibrated with energy, and even charm, and he was well
aware of this, and knew how to use it to his advantage. He kept
talking, enjoying the sound of his own voice. "As you know, the
original plan was for Poko Na to join us after we had marched
several days away from his country. He's clever enough not to trust
us alone with the ivory, of course. He was also clever in
organizing the warriors of his tribe into that secret society of
Spirit Men, or whatever it is. That gave him enough power and
control to keep them from interfering with our little operation
here. It also provided him with something of a bodyguard in case we
should decide to get rid of him the quick, easy way."</p>

<p>"It sounds to me," said the Countessa, "as if Poko Na has
covered himself admirably. How are you going to get rid of
him?"</p>

<p>Lavic smiled. "The quick, easy way. Naturally."</p>

<p>"Oh?" She raised thin eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Do you see the cleverness of it?" He brushed imaginary dust
from his bush jacket. "Poko Na, with his Spirit Men there to
protect him, feels secure. His guard is down. The last thing in the
world he will expect will be a direct attack on his village by my
askaris. Therefore I have the advantage of surprise. We'll move
tomorrow morning, while it's still dark, upon their main
village&mdash;"</p>

<p>She frowned. "You're certain this will work?"</p>

<p>"It will have to," said Lavic, laughing. "I've already given the
askaris and porters their instructions in the matter."</p>

<p>SHEENA, crouching among the bright green fronds of the
swamp-tree, heard this conversation. She smiled to herself as she
did. She held her bow and a ready arrow; she held the bow lightly,
and not yet drawn, and she glanced upward, with Lavic, and saw the
two tiny doll figures of the porters clinging to the rope high
above. Some of the mist had cleared and the top of the cliff was
faintly visible. Sheena's jungle-trained eyes could see the porters
disappearing over the top. Now they would work the windlass and the
elevator basket with its cargo of ivory would begin to rise.</p>

<p>She glanced at the cliff-face appraisingly, re-checking her
plan. It was sheer, smooth rock, reddish in color and faintly
translucent, like alabaster. There were few breaks or ledges that
could be called foot holds. As far as Sheena had been able to tell,
the rope was the only way out of the valley&mdash;and K'ando had
confirmed that. At any rate, her plan depended on this fact.</p>

<p>The rope tightened suddenly and began to move slowly upward,
rocking and twisting a little as it went.</p>

<p>"There it goes!" the Countess called to Lavic.</p>

<p>The basket swayed heavily, clearing the ground by one foot, then
two, then three. It began to rise steadily, as the porters above
worked the windlass with a smoother rhythm. The rest of the porters
and askaris stared at the rising container silently: in spite of
the fact that they had already seen the windlass it still seemed
somewhat magical to them to watch the basket move.</p>

<p>Sheena drew her bow. She raised it, tracking the rope carefully.
The elevator had picked up speed now: ten, fifteen, twenty feet
above the ground. She aimed for a spot in the rope itself, just
over the basket. Thirty feet high now.</p>

<p>Sheena's arrow nicked the rope precisely where she had aimed. No
sooner had the bow twanged than she had reached across her
shoulder, selected another arrow, fitted and drawn it, all in a
continuous motion. Twang! The second arrow nicked the rope, too.
Twang! Twang! A third and a fourth&mdash;</p>

<p>The strands parted, spinning the rope a little. The heavy basket
of tusks hung precariously. The four arrows had come so swiftly
that only now did Lavic and the others react. Lavic shouted and ran
toward the swinging basket. At that moment the rope broke; the
basket came down with a crash. Lavic leaped out of the way, and it
barely missed him.</p>

<p>The soldier of fortune whirled then, facing the treetops from
which the arrows had come. His pistol was drawn. He lifted it
furiously and emptied it into the foliage; the shots echoed heavily
against the smooth cliff face.</p>

<p>Sheena heard the slugs slap through the leaves and branches all
about her, and as she backed away to climb down the other side of
the tree she heard Lavic call out desperate orders to his
askaris.</p>

<p>She was still smiling. Lavic and his party couldn't get out of
the valley without that rope. It would take hours, or even days for
the blacks at the windlass to find another one. But Sheena knew how
to get out. And as soon as these people had calmed down a little
she would bargain with them.</p>

<p>She reached the soft, loamy ground and turned to move further
into the swamp and find Rick. In that moment there was a long,
weird screaming noise, something like the rage-cry of a crocodile
but twice as loud and ten times as horrible.</p>

<p>RICK, for all his jungle-hardness, had been momentarily frozen
when he first turned to find the huge reptile staring at him, then
opening its jaws. In the next instant, as his powers of reflection
came back, he realized that freezing like that had probably saved
his life for the moment anyway. The monster closed its jaws again.
Its head swayed back and forth, brushing lightly against the
foliage. Its blank, pupilless eyes studied Rick.</p>

<p>Minutes passed, and they seemed like hours. Rick was beginning
to get stiff from his cramped position in the tree. Still he didn't
dare move for movement was the one thing likely to attract the
monster, likely to make those jaws open again, come forward and
snap.</p>

<p>His fingers, holding to a branch, began to be numb now.
Something made them hold on&mdash;not muscle certainly, but
something that was part will power and part sheer luck. He
remembered then that Chim was in the same tree, somewhere behind
him, and he hoped fervently that the monkey wouldn't take it into
his head to move, or make a sound and attract the reptile. The only
chance now was to keep the thing puzzled like this&mdash;if that
dim reaction could be called puzzlement.</p>

<p>No sooner had this idea occurred to him than there was a
rustling behind him. The monster's head stopped moving again. Its
beady eyes cast about; the pits halfway along its snout began to
dilate. An oily shudder went down its neck and into the sluggish
body below.</p>

<p>"Chee-chee-chee-chee-chee!" came Chim's voice.</p>

<p>The head snaked forward, barely missing Rick. Rick heard the
jaws snap. It was like the sound of an axe striking hard mahogany.
Rick moved quickly, throwing himself on the back of the saurian's
neck. Here he clung with every ounce of strength in him.</p>

<p>The monster screamed. The scream was terrifying. Rick felt the
shrill vibration in the long neck to which he clung.</p>

<p>The monster began to thrash about in the thick foliage, knocking
huge ferns and bushes flat with its broad, heavy tail. It screamed
again as Rick felt his fingers slipping a little on the smooth,
clammy neck. He renewed his grip.</p>

<p>Sheena was just coming into sight when she heard this second
scream. She had sped toward the sound of the first one, not
bothering to go around the swampy patches but clearing them in
tremendous leaps and now, as she beheld the thrashing monster with
Rick clinging to its neck, she slipped her bow from her shoulder
again.</p>

<p>Twang! twang! twang! She loosed three arrows in succession, her
movements a blur.</p>

<p>Each sank to its feathers in the monster's body&mdash;but they
had no effect. It was doubtful that he even felt them.</p>

<p>"Don't let go, Rick! Hang on!" She called that brief bit of
encouragement to him. Then she looked up into the trees.
"Chim!"</p>

<p>Two ferns parted and the monkey's head appeared. He looked so
desperately bewildered that under other circumstances Sheena might
have laughed. She bounded into the tree that held the monkey.
"Chim!" she gestured. "Do what I do. Over there. And there." Chim
seemed to understand.</p>

<p>He chattered, squawked, swung over toward the thrashing monster
and then began to yammer loudly to attract its attention. The huge
lizard bellowed: a moment later it spotted Chim. Now, for an
instant it seemed to forget the strange creature clinging to its
neck. Its head lunged forward. The great jaws snapped, and Chim
danced out of the way. But not entirely out of the way. He stayed
in sight&mdash;still moving about, still making noise and
attracting attention.</p>

<p>Sheena meanwhile, found a hanging creeper. She slashed at it
with her poniard, then pulled it to her and working with swift
fingers fashioned a slip loop on one end of it.</p>

<p>"Now this way, Chim. Draw him over this way!" she called.</p>

<p>CHIM took a running start along one of the heavy fronds, then
leapt and sailed through the air. The saurian's head swung,
tracking him. For just a second it was in the clear, free of the
surrounding growth. Sheena swung her loop. It settled over that
long neck. She drew it tight and quickly fastened the other end to
the tree.</p>

<p>It was as Sheena had suspected. The monster was too
small-brained to associate the slender creeper with the new tight
feeling on his neck. He pulled the other way and the loop
tightened. Then he tried to turn his head to snap at it, and after
that he began to lash his tail again; frightened, annoyed.</p>

<p>Rick started to leap from the monster's neck.</p>

<p>"Not yet!" cautioned Sheena. She called to Chim again: "More,
Chim, more!"</p>

<p>The monkey began to hop up and down and jump through the
branches. He kept up his mad chattering. The lizard lunged and
snapped at him again. Sheena found another creeper, hacked it and
put a loop in it the same way. She waited until the saurian's head
was free again, then threw this second loop.</p>

<p>The monster was caught from two directions now. The creepers,
similar to the liana of the ordinary jungle, were green and strong.
It tried to bellow again, thrusting its head high, but that only
tightened the nooses. The bellow was cut short.</p>

<p>"Now!" Sheena called to Rick.</p>

<p>Rick leapt, and barely made a nearby tree. He swung himself into
it, moved over into another tree and then dropped to the ground
again. Sheena and Chim met him there. She touched his arm for just
a moment, and at the same time searched his gray eyes. Just a faint
smile on her lips. That was all that was necessary to show her deep
affection in this instant.</p>

<p>"We'd better get out of this swamp," Rick said. "Lavic and his
girl friend must have heard that reptile scream. They'll be here in
a moment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let us wait for them," said Sheena.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rick was unable to finish. A fusillade of shots broke out a
short distance to their left, where the monster, snagged by the
looped vines was still thrashing. Looking through the trees, Rick
glimpsed the moving bodies of the askaris, and presently the tall
form of Lavic. The Countess's graceful and slender figure appeared
a moment later. Shouts and cries as they killed the reptile.</p>

<p>And then Lavic stepped into the small clearing where Rick and
Sheena stood. His rifle was leveled. He showed surprise, utter
surprise for just an instant. Then he recovered himself.</p>

<p>"It would seem," he said smoothly, "that this place is full of
surprises."</p>

<p>"Yes, so it would seem," said Rick. He had to force the words
through tight lips. He could barely keep from rushing Lavic and
slugging it out&mdash;and never mind the fancy rifle Lavic held at
the ready.</p>

<p>The Countess came up alongside of Lavic and the askaris stepped
into view, ranging themselves on both flanks. Now, besides Lavic's
rifle, six carbines were pointed at Rick and Sheena. Rick glanced
at Sheena anxiously. Lavic's eyes were moving up and down now, as
he looked at Sheena. The Countess glanced at him, and didn't miss
that. Rick saw the quick cloud cross her brow. Then Lavic spoke
again. "I suppose you must be Sheena, yes? I've heard of you. I
must confess I didn't really believe you existed, but you seem real
enough. And&mdash;uh&mdash;attractive enough, too, I would say. Was
it you who cut the lifting rope with your arrows?"</p>

<p>Sheena said, "Yes. Can you guess why?"</p>

<p>"I am at a loss." Lavic half-bowed. He had assumed an artificial
gallant manner now&mdash;an automatic manner that came on whenever
he faced a beautiful woman.</p>

<p>"You can put those guns down," Sheena said pointing. "You don't
want to shoot us. If you do you'll never get out of this
valley."</p>

<p>"And why not, may I ask?" Lavic lifted an eyebrow.</p>

<p>"There's no other way out. K'ando has told us that. Your porters
are up at the top of the windlass. But they still can't lower the
rope enough for anyone down here to reach it. I don't think they'll
be able to find more rope to attach to the end. At any rate, you
can't afford to take the chance that they will."</p>

<p>Lavic's smile faded a little. "But may I point out that you and
Thorne are not able to leave the valley, either?"</p>

<p>Sheena shook her head. "We will all be able to leave the valley.
But only I know the way to do it. That's why you don't dare
shoot."</p>

<p>The Countess, angry-eyed, stepped forward. "She's bluffing!"</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Narcissa," said Lavic, with annoyance he couldn't
hide. He kept looking at Sheena. "What is this way out of
yours?"</p>

<p>"It is simple." Sheena looked down at the monkey at her side.
"None of us can climb the cliff wall. But Chim can. We will gather
enough vines to make a long line. Chim will carry this to the top,
fasten it to the big rope, and then we may pull it down again." Her
eyes came up. "But there are conditions. First: you must take no
Bilina ivory with you. Second: you throw all of your weapons into
the deepest water of the swamp."</p>

<p>"What?" spouted Lavic.</p>

<p>Sheena shrugged. "It is your choice."</p>

<p>Lavic glanced at the Countess but she was looking at Rick. Lavic
finally turned to Sheena again, spread his hands in a gesture of
resignation and said, "We'll do as you say."</p>

<p>It took them the better part of a half hour to gather all the
creepers necessary for a second line. Sheena supervised this part
of it and Rick went with Lavic and several of the askaris to dump
the weapons; Rick kept one rifle for himself. Nearly an hour later
the neatly-coiled and tightly-knotted line was ready. Sheena tied
it about Chim's waist. Chim stared at it, puzzled.</p>

<p>She knelt beside him, spoke swiftly and pointed to the top. Then
she pointed to the line itself and went through the motions of
tying.</p>

<p>"But can he do it? Will he know how to tie a knot?" asked
Rick.</p>

<p>Sheens said, "He's done it several times. Let us hope he can
remember when he reaches the top."</p>

<p>Lavic, frowning, stepped forward and started to say, "Look
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sheena whirled upon him. Her hands moved so swiftly that in the
next second she held an arrow across her bow, pointed at Lavic.
"You're not to come near, any of you, do you understand?"</p>

<p>Lavic glowered and stepped back again.</p>

<p>Sheena repeated her instructions to Chim once more. The monkey
glanced upward this time, scratched his head, hopped up and down a
bit, and then tugged at the creeper about his middle. Patiently,
Sheena told him what he must do a third time. Now, finally, he
seemed to understand. He scurried to the foot of the cliff, found a
hand-hold, and began to pull himself upward. His fingers found tiny
nicks and irregularities in the otherwise sheer rock&mdash;a human
being would have been unable to support his weight with so little
purchase.</p>

<p>After a little experimental fumbling Chim began to climb away
more swiftly and surely. The others stared upward watching him
disappear.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">POKO NA, prince of the Bilina, and leader of that
tribe's organization of Spirit Men, stared from the gloom at a pair
of blacks who, partly concealed by a boulder, were working a large
bamboo windlass.</p>

<p>Poko Na turned to the warrior behind him, raising his eyebrows
to form a question. The warrior, who had a zebra-skin kaross about
his shoulders, shrugged. He knew not these strange blacks.</p>

<p>Poko Na frowned, stared at them again, but this time there was a
tiny smile on his lips. He knew well enough that these strange
blacks were members of Ferdinand Lavic's safari, and that Lavic and
the others were down in the valley. The agreement had been, of
course, that he was not to interfere, except for a token attack
after Lavic had procured the ivory and was already on his way back
to the river. But the appearance of Sheena, and then her escape,
had changed matters a little. Poko Na had thought everything over
carefully by now. It was clear that he had better investigate, and
that was his purpose here. He had brought with him only a half
dozen warriors for if they should stumble upon his scheme in any
way he could find a way to rid himself of such a small number.</p>

<p>At the moment the best thing seemed to be to follow a course
that would appear natural to them. Poko Na pointed silently to the
two porters, and nodded. The warrior in the zebra kaross nodded
back, whispered something to the man behind him, and then the
advice was passed along.</p>

<p>A few seconds later all seven of them moved silently from the
mouth of the tunnel and crossed the little ledge with catlike
steps. One of the porters turned an instant before Poko Na was upon
him. Poko Na saw his frozen surprise, stood upright and swung a
heavy, knobbed club with all his strength. The porter, his temple
cracked, dropped away. The other one spun around. Two of the Spirit
Men leapt, pinned his arms behind him and held him.</p>

<p>Poko Na loomed over the porter: his own shifty, coffee-black
eyes stared down into the native's white-ringed orbs. The native's
lips moved as he tried to speak, but no words came out.</p>

<p>"What do you here?" snapped Poko Na. He spoke river Congolese,
the language the black would be most likely to understand. The
warriors wouldn't understand it, of course, and thus no matter what
the black said about Lavic, they wouldn't learn how Poko Na
intended to deceive his own tribe.</p>

<p>"The white man sent me here," the black finally stammered in a
weak voice.</p>

<p>Poko Na grinned. He would bait this ignorant native: that would
be amusing. "You help the white man steal the Bilina's ivory, is it
not so?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no. By the forest spirits, I swear!" lied the native,
shaking his head in panic.</p>

<p>Poko Na gripped him by the throat. He squeezed until the black's
tongue came out, until his eyes seemed ready to pop from their
sockets. Then abruptly he let go again. The black gasped for
breath. "Now," said Poko Na, "we will have the truth. The white man
means to steal ivory, does he not?"</p>

<p>The black waggled his head, the Congo gesture for "Yes."</p>

<p>"The white man would steal as the jackal, quietly, and leave
before he is seen. Is this not true?" Poko Na's expression was
fierce, but he was chuckling inside.</p>

<p>This time the native said, "No."</p>

<p>"What?" Poko Na grabbed his throat again. "You would lie
more?"</p>

<p>"I swear it. I swear it, great chief! The white man will not
leave in darkness, but instead attack the Bilina village,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What? Say this again!" Poko Na was no longer amused. His
fingers tightened on the black's throat.</p>

<p>The black tried to talk, and couldn't.</p>

<p>Poko Na let go once more. "Speak, jackal!"</p>

<p>"Spare my life, great chief, and I will speak&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Speak!" roared Poko Na.</p>

<p>The black swallowed the dryness of his own month. "The white man
will attack the Bilina village at dawn. It will be burned. All in
it will be slain."</p>

<p>Poko Na turned to the warrior in the zebra skin and held out his
hand. "Your spear." The warrior handed the weapon over. Calmly and
with no change of expression then, he turned once more, put the
point of the spear to the porter's middle, and while the black was
still looking at it, he thrust it forward. The porter fell, kicking
and screaming and holding the wound. The warrior in the zebra skin
silenced him with a vicious club blow upon his head.</p>

<p>"Now," said Poko Na. "We wait." He pointed to the edge of the
cliff. "Presently whites and other river-jackals will appear. When
they have gathered here we attack. But you will not move until I
give the signal."</p>

<p>The other warriors moved immediately back into the gloom of the
tunnel's mouth, and Poko Na joined them there.</p>

<p>They waited. They squatted silently, still as black granite, and
kept their eyes on the spot where their prey would appear. They
breathed so softly and with such control, that there was no sound
of it. The eagle, passing by, wouldn't have seen them without
looking directly at them, and possibly not then.</p>

<p>In spite of Poko Na's hard, emotionless expression he was
roiling with emotion inside. He should have known better than to
trust Lavic, the white man with the clever tongue and the too-ready
smile. He should have relied in the first place upon his inner
feeling, which was to hate any and all white men. It was the white
man who, babbling piously, had taken him from the jungle and sent
him to a missionary school near the coast: his father had not only
permitted it, but even urged them to do it. And then the head of
the school had taken a liking to Poko Na, because he was bright,
quick with words and numbers. Such a boy in Poko Na's tribe would
have been mistrusted, and possibly even executed as someone filled
with evil spirits&mdash;but to these things the white man took a
liking. There had been a scholarship, and Poko Na had gone further
in school, then traveled to the white man's cities, wearing the
white man's clothes.</p>

<p>Well, he was through with all of that now. Never, never again
would he enter into any scheme of importance with the white man,
although he would still try to find a way to live in the white
man's civilization and comfort, which he preferred. As far as the
Bilina ivory was concerned, he would find others to dispose of it.
In the coast towns there would be Syrian dealers, Arab traders,
American derelicts, Greek adventurers; there would be others he
could use. But he would keep even more careful tabs on his partner
this next time.</p>

<p>As he watched, a monkey's head appeared over the lip of the
cliff.</p>

<p>It surprised Poko Na; it surprised him in spite of himself. The
surprise was like a quick sheet of lightning, and then, when it had
gone, he remembered this creature&mdash;he remembered the lithe,
blonde jungle goddess who had brought it into his kraal. The
warrior behind him touched his arm and nodded at the monkey, and
Poko Na put his thumb to his lip for silence. He would continue to
watch for the present.</p>

<p>THE MONKEY acted unlike any other he had ever seen. Its behavior
was almost human. As Poko Na stared, the creature began to haul in
a thin line made of creepers that was attached, Poko Na saw now,
about its waist. And as soon as it had enough slack it hopped to
the windlass, found the end of the big knotted rope and proceeded
to tie the line to it.</p>

<p>Poko Na turned. He glanced at his warriors behind him. Their
eyes were fearful&mdash;this was strange magic when the furry
creature of the treetops could do things like this. He considered
for a moment explaining that the jungle goddess must have trained
the animal, but decided against that. They might fear even more a
white woman who could accomplish that much with a jungle
creature.</p>

<p>But now, with its task finished, the monkey disappeared over the
edge of the cliff again A second later the windlass began to turn,
paying out the knotted climbing rope.</p>

<p>Once more Poko Na and his warriors waited patiently. But the
warriors stirred a little this time; they glanced at each other,
frowned, and then looked at Poko Na as if waiting for an
explanation. Poko Na felt that saying nothing would be the wisest
course for the moment. Later, at the village, he would distract the
warriors with a ceremony, and dull their wits with spiked kaffir
beer. That would keep them from asking too many questions about his
relationships with Lavic.</p>

<p>As Poko Na sat there waiting, Sheena was far below, starting the
climb out of the valley. The rope had been repaired, and Sheena had
directed that she would climb first, then Lavic and the Countess
and the natives of his safari, and finally Rick. In this way
Lavic's party would be guarded at both ends.</p>

<p>She felt a strong sense of caution as she sped upward, hand over
hand. Lavic had been very quiet; several times she had caught him
trading glances with the Countess. As for the Countess herself, she
had been much too interested in Rick to return all of Lavic's
glances. The woman in Sheena could see this easily enough.</p>

<p>She outdistanced the two whites and the askaris and porters
climbing behind her; she reached the top of the cliff when they
were still swaying on the rope far below. She scrambled on to the
level platform lightly, not expecting trouble of any kind. She
glanced downward, saw that everything was still going according to
plan, and then turned toward the tunnel by which they'd first
reached this place.</p>

<p>There was time for one tingling warning along her spine. It came
from something beyond the ordinary senses&mdash;jungle instinct,
perhaps&mdash;because she saw or heard nothing untoward. Just the
dark mouth of the tunnel, and the sun beating down on the sand and
rock a few feet from it. Yet something made her move; something
made her spring suddenly to the right.</p>

<p>A heavy-bladed spear came hurtling from the tunnel. It might
have impaled Sheena through the chest if she hadn't dodged. As it
was, it scraped her shoulder, then sailed over the cliff edge and
fell away in a long arc. She felt the sharp bite of pain, yet knew
it was only a flesh wound.</p>

<p>Even as Sheena leapt, and as the spear grazed her, she was
reaching for her bow. By now only three arrows remained in her
quiver. She slipped the bow from her shoulder, twisting slightly to
do so. Her right foot, moving backward a little, suddenly had
nothing below it. She tried to throw herself forward, away from the
edge of the cliff, and regain her balance, but that right foot
plunged downward and the sickening sensation of a fall made a
sudden, sharp pang in the pit of her stomach.</p>

<p>In that same blurred instant she saw Poko Na's tall form emerge
from the tunnel: saw the dark, nervous eyes glaring at her from
either side of that slightly hooked nose, and all of it framed by
the tusks along the side of his head.</p>

<p>Sheena, dropping her bow, grabbed for the edge of the cliff as
she fell past it. Her fingers slipped a fraction of an inch, then
held; she pressed with all her strength to hold herself there. She
moved her legs against the cliff face, desperately seeking a
foothold. There was none. She pulled then, chinning herself upward
with a tremendous strength belied by the supple muscles of her arms
and shoulders; she came again to the level of the platform and slid
forward over it.</p>

<p>She meant to spring upward then, but she never had the chance.
Strong black arms came down instead and yanked her to her feet.</p>

<p>It was as if every nerve and muscle in Sheena's body had
suddenly exploded. She tore from their grasps, whirled, plunged,
turned, kicked and struck out. She was a lioness surrounded by
jackals. She struck the zebra-warrior on the point of the jaw with
her fist: the blow was swift and accurate rather than smashing, but
nevertheless it sent him reeling backward. Immediately she swung
her arm the other way, clipping another warrior across the bridge
of the nose with her heavy gold bracelet. A third warrior was
behind her, lifting a knobbed club. She sensed his presence. She
kicked out behind, caught him in the middle and sent him tumbling
over the cliff edge. His howl of terror faded as he fell
away&mdash;</p>

<p>It surprised Poko Na and his bodyguard considerably. They had
come to capture a woman and found a wild thing in their midst. A
demoness, whose movements could scarcely be followed with the eye
and whose strength was that of a thousand devils. There was more
than surprise here, there was bewilderment, too. In a moment or two
Sheena might have broken away from them completely. But in their
very bewilderment at least three of the Spirit Men were swinging
their knobbed clubs aimlessly. There was a loud crack, loud but
dull, like the sound of a bush-knife biting into bark. Sheena heard
it as a queer, far-off explosion and at the same time saw a cascade
of colored flashes before her eyes.</p>

<p>After that, deep blackness and the sensation of floating in
cold, endless space.</p>

<p>SHE heard the drums and the strange, shrill music long before
she opened her eyes. Even in this state of semi-consciousness her
jungle instinct told her to be still.</p>

<p>A moment later the smell of rotting vegetation and woodsmoke
told her that she was in the main Bilina village. She opened her
eyes and waited for them to focus. The first thing she saw were the
bamboo stakes all about her, they were driven into the ground, and
then a top was lashed on making a kind of cage. She was lying on
the floor of it. She turned her head cautiously and saw that other
cages had been fashioned beside hers, other captives in them: Lavic
standing at the bars of one, looking disheveled and wild-eyed now;
the Countess just beyond, and she, oddly enough, still seemed
unruffled, poised. Rick in the furthest cage. Rick was sitting on
the floor of it with his arms clasped about his folded knees. He
might have been taking a moment's rest on a long safari. His eyes,
though, were not missing anything.</p>

<p>Now Sheena glanced toward the clearing. Lavic's porters and
askaris were nowhere to be seen, and she could guess that they had
probably been slain quickly before the whites had been brought
here. At any rate, out there in the clearing, Poko Na and the
Spirit Men were gathering for what was obviously a ceremony of some
kind.</p>

<p>They were drawn in two lines, flanking the clearing. Among the
thatched huts beyond them other villagers stared out in quiet
terror&mdash;mostly women, older men and children who hadn't yet
reached warrior age.</p>

<p>At the far end of the village a native orchestra was gathering.
There were drums of different sizes, xylophones of ebony and
ironwood lying flat on the ground, and reed flutes both tiny and
huge.</p>

<p>Poko Na was in the middle. He wore a leopard-skin kaross now,
and a circlet of claws about his head. His shoulders were thrown
back and he kept his hawk's nose high and arrogant. He turned
toward the largest of the huts&mdash;the council hut&mdash;and
chattered sharply. A group of woman there began to dip cups of
hollowed bamboo joints in a huge vat that stood by the corner of
the hut. This would be the kaffir beer that Poko Na had made into a
drink of courage for his warriors. Each woman, when she had dipped
a cupful, ran into the clearing and passed the portion to a
warrior. The warriors drank quickly, some in one gulp, and when
they had finished they tossed the cups aside haughtily. The women
scurried to retrieve them.</p>

<p>Sheena rose to her feet now. Her head throbbed, but she made
herself ignore the pain. Lavic, in the next cage, saw her come to
life and his shrill voice, no longer smooth and confident called
out to her. "Sheena! You&mdash;you must talk to them! You must get
us out of here! I'll pay anything&mdash;I'll make you
rich&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Countess cut him short. "Oh, be quiet you fool," she said
wearily. "Die with courage now&mdash;that's the least you can
do."</p>

<p>Sheena ignored both of them. She called instead to Rick in the
farthest cage. "Rick, are you all right?"</p>

<p>He grinned back at her. A little shakily&mdash;but he grinned.
"So far," he said, "if that's any help."</p>

<p>"Where's Chim?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Sheena. He disappeared in the mix-up. He
may&mdash;"</p>

<p>The drums cut Rick short. They started with a slow, broken beat.
The warriors straightened their line and then began to follow the
drumbeat by striking their spear hafts on the ground. They shuffled
their feet sideways, taking several steps, dipping, reversing
direction, all in unison.</p>

<p>The instruments came in. Tinkling? wailing? a curious, hypnotic
melody coiled like a snake around the line of the drumbeat. The
Spirit Men began to chant: "Yo, yo&mdash;Mani sokayo. Yo. Yo. Mani
sokayo." Sheena recognized the death chant.</p>

<p>The villagers, half-hiding themselves among the huts, continued
to stare.</p>

<p>The chanting went on monotonously for perhaps twenty minutes.
Suddenly Poko Na stepped into the center of the clearing, held up
his hand, and cried out another series of orders. The dancers
stopped. A second time the women ran out with cups of kaffir beer.
This time the warriors held their cups stiffly instead of drinking
right away. A single drumbeat sounded. Poko Na raised his spear in
one hand, his shield in the other. "The spirits of the wild things
enter our hearts!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Yo!" chanted the rest, and drank.</p>

<p>"The brave spirit of the lion, the cunning spirit of the
leopard, the swift spirit of the antelope, and the strong spirit of
the elephant!"</p>

<p>"Yo!" They drank again.</p>

<p>This was repeated several times with variations. When they had
drained the cups they again threw them away contemptuously and
allowed the women to gather them up. Once more the dancing was
resumed.</p>

<p>Sheena guessed that this ceremony was likely to continue for
some time. The sun was already low in the west, tinting the yellow
haze over the jungle orange and red. They would dance after the sun
had gone, they would dance far into the night. And one by one their
captives would die&mdash;</p>

<p>Two warriors broke suddenly from the line and stalked in long,
purposeful strides toward the cage that held the Countess
Narcissa.</p>

<p>"No!" screamed Lavic, gripping the bamboo bars of his own cage
until his knuckles were white.</p>

<p>The Countess held her head high. She faced the approaching
warriors and said nothing; only a slight paleness of her cheeks
gave any indication of how she felt. She crossed her arms over her
chest, and walked out firmly when they opened the cage, ignoring
completely their firm grips upon her arms.</p>

<p>Poko Na called another command. The warriors formed a circle
about thirty feet in diameter and raised their spears. Darkness was
falling now and the women began to throw wood on the scattered
fires in the clearing, sending the flames higher, so that red
reflections danced in the broad spear heads.</p>

<p>The two warriors moved the Countess toward the circle of
spears.</p>

<p>She jerked from their grasp suddenly. She had been too calm
until this moment, and they hadn't expected that. She broke loose,
then started to run for the jungle. But she was
foredoomed&mdash;and Sheena suspected she must have realized this
all along. The Countess ran perhaps ten strides before the first of
the spears came whistling toward her. Three struck her in the back
at the same time; one pierced her entirely. She ran for several
additional stumbling steps before she fell.</p>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE WARRIORS ran to surround the dead woman and to
plunge their spears into the body over and over again. And when
they had tired of that, Poko Na called for more of the filled
bamboo cups.</p>

<p>It was while they were drinking the ceremonial draft again that
Sheena heard from the nearby jungle the chattering of a monkey. To
anyone else it would have sounded like the chattering of any
monkey&mdash;but to Sheena the voice was as familiar as her own.
Carefully her eyes swept over the jungle wall where it stopped at
the edge of the village. She cocked her head and listened.</p>

<p>Now a cautious whisper from the other side of the wall behind
her cage came to her ears. "Sheena!" The voice was deep and
rich&mdash;and hearing it she could almost see K'ando's huge,
resonant bulk behind it.</p>

<p>"K'ando!" she called back. "Yes, I hear you." She didn't turn
toward him, but looked out into the clearing where the warriors had
begun to dance again, and where the sound of music and drums kept
them from hearing this conversation.</p>

<p>"I heard that Poko Na had brought captured whites to the
village," whispered K'ando. "I came here, and then Chim dropped
from the trees to greet me. He is with me and shakes with
fright."</p>

<p>Sheena said, "Listen carefully, K'ando. It is impossible for you
to enter the stockade. You would be seen immediately. But there is
one who may enter. Chim is small. He may climb the wall and keep to
the shadows."</p>

<p>"Aiee," said K'ando, "but the furry one has not the strength to
overcome so many spears&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Strength will not be needed," said Sheena quickly. "Only
something from the jungle. You should be able to find it very
quickly. When you do, you will instruct Chim&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sheena talked swiftly, outlining her plan. As she did so the
music crescendoed and the drummers increased the fury of their
beat. Night had descended fully now: the sky was deep black and the
stars were hard diamonds crushed and thrown across it. The flames
of the village fires leapt high, vying with the dancers. Black
bodies and white paint glistened; shields and spears flashed in
counterpoint to the dance.</p>

<p>After a while Sheena was no longer able to tell how long it had
been going on. For once, her sense of time was dulled&mdash;the
hypnotic effect of the music. She saw now that there was madness in
the eyes of the Spirit Men, and even Poko Na, ordinarily
strong-minded and cynical, was feeling it. He, at this moment, was
dancing more furiously than any of them.</p>

<p>But Sheena's eyes were fastened on a place near the council hut
across the clearing. Here stood the huge vat of kaffir beer, and
near it the women with the cups who served the warriors. But the
women weren't watching the vat&mdash;their eyes, like all others in
the village, were on the wild dance, gripped by the evil
fascination of it.</p>

<p>Abruptly a small, furry figure appeared from the plantain grove
beyond the council hut. He looked about cautiously for a moment,
then quickly scurried toward the vat. He had something in his hand,
and he dropped this into the vat, then ran back and faded into the
grove again.</p>

<p>The music and dancing continued and Sheena, every nerve almost
to the breaking point, held herself still and waited. The shadows
of the warriors were leaping ghosts on the jungle foliage beyond.
The death chant sounded over and over again: "Yo, yo, mani sokayo!
Yo, yo, mani sokayo?"</p>

<p>Suddenly, as if by a strange, silent command, the music stopped.
The dancers became still. Poko Na lifted both arms. "We will drink
of the magic waters again!" he cried.</p>

<p>The women hurried to dip the bamboo cups.</p>

<p>Sheena's voice, firm and strong, suddenly sounded across the
clearing. "Now the vengeance of the forest spirits comes to the
Spirit Men!" she called in Bilina dialect.</p>

<p>It startled Poko Na, then infuriated him. He whirled toward
Sheena's cage. He pointed at it. "Take her!" he roared. "She shall
suffer the death of spears next!"</p>

<p>Two warriors had been enough to take the Countess from her cage,
but eight of them came forward to bring Sheena. She surprised them
by making no struggle. She went with them easily and quietly to the
center of the clearing.</p>

<p>Poko Na raised both arms again in the ceremonial gesture. He
kept his eyes on Sheena. "The spirits of the wild things enter our
hearts!" he chanted.</p>

<p>The women brought the bamboo cups to the warriors now. Again,
each dancer drained his portion in a gulp, and tossed the cup
behind him.</p>

<p>Poko Na did not drink. He kept looking at Sheena. There was
triumph in his look, but a slight undercurrent of uncertainty, too,
and Sheena didn't miss this.</p>

<p>She raised her own arms suddenly. "Now Sheena's magic
begins!"</p>

<p>It was timed perfectly. No sooner had she spoken than strange
things began to happen. One of the Spirit Men suddenly clapped his
hands to his stomach and groaned. Others stared about stupidly,
puzzled, bewildered. A warrior in a lion's mane cried suddenly,
"Water!" He began to run toward the council hut, then abruptly
stumbled and fell.</p>

<p>Some of the warriors now began to make choking sounds. Others
were grabbing desperately at aching throats. One raced, screaming,
for the plantain grove, fell and then began to kick himself in a
flat, spasmodic circle on the ground.</p>

<p>Before another minute had passed not a warrior was standing.</p>

<p>Except Poko Na. His initial surprise had gone. He was staring at
Sheena now, beginning to suspect a little of what must have
happened. But Sheena had the advantage of surprise in this moment,
and she meant to keep it. Coolly, right before Poko Na's eyes, she
picked up a bush-knife that one of the fallen warriors had dropped.
She walked over to Rick's cage.</p>

<p>Rick grinned at her through the bamboo bars and said, "I knew
all the time you'd do it."</p>

<p>She smiled fleetingly, chopped the rawhide cage fastenings
apart, and Rick stepped into the open.</p>

<p>"Sheena! You cannot forget me! You must release me, too,
Sheena!" screamed Lavic.</p>

<p>Sheena looked at him in disgust&mdash;but nevertheless walked
over to his cage and cut the thongs.</p>

<p>Poko Na suddenly roared a terrible sound of anger and
frustration. He raised his spear and narrowed his eyes at Sheena.
She whirled toward him. There was no time to rush him with her
bush-knife, nor was there time to scoop a fallen spear from the
ground.</p>

<p>"Look out, Sheena!" Rick cried. It distracted Poko Na for a
moment. He turned his eyes toward Rick and in doing that he saw
Lavic again. He saw him as if for the first time. His brow clouded
even more, as if with a new gust in a rainstorm already raging. His
close-set eyes glittered in their deep sockets; this was the man
who had brought all of it about; here was the man who had tried to
make a fool of him.</p>

<p>Poko Na's spear arm racked back.</p>

<p>Lavic had just enough time to widen his eyes and cry, "No!"</p>

<p>The spear came forward in a slight, almost imperceptible curve,
streaking across the distance between the two men. Lavic tried to
dodge. The heavy point caught him, with a sound like a knife
striking a rotten apple, in the left breast. The force of the thing
slammed him against the cage he had just left. He leaned there for
a moment looking stupidly down at the weapon in his body. Then he
sank slowly, his eyes still open, and a second later he was sitting
there, dead.</p>

<p>Sheena lost no time as all of this happened. She pounced on
another fallen spear, then faced Poko Na, holding the weapon
lightly and ready to throw.</p>

<p>He turned and stared at her, His eyes were filmed over; in them
was the hopelessness of a man who has lost everything. Yet he was
not afraid; he squared his shoulders and stuck his chest forward,
waiting for Sheena to strike.</p>

<p>There was a sudden clamor at the stockade gate and women ran to
open it. As they watched, K'ando entered. The big native was
dressed in the ceremonial costume of a full chief of the Bilina. He
walked slowly across the compound with his curious fat man's grace.
He held a spear, too. He stopped twenty paces from Poko Na and kept
his eyes on the usurper. Then he glanced at Sheena for a brief
instant. "Give him a spear, too, O Sheena."</p>

<p>Sheena understood. By the code of the tribe it was necessary for
K'ando to kill Poko Na with his own hand&mdash;and by choice K'ando
was offering him an equal combat. The Bilina would long remember
how their rightful chief acted in this matter.</p>

<p>"Do as he says. Pick up a spear," she said to Poko Na.</p>

<p>He moved slowly, and with his eyes still on K'ando. Holding
their weapons then, the two men faced each other&mdash;one long,
sinewy and nervous; the other fat, but tapered and graceful.</p>

<p>"Hai!" said Sheena abruptly, giving the signal.</p>

<p>Poko Na hurled his spear desperately and with an arcing motion
of his long body. K'ando barely seemed to move. The tall black's
spear hurtled by K'ando, just missing his shoulder&mdash;and
K'ando's spear struck the leader of the Spirit Men in the very
center of his torso.</p>

<p>It was three days later. Three people stood at the edge of a
great forest.</p>

<p>"And now the trail parts," said Sheena.</p>

<p>K'ando nodded, and pointed northwest: "In this direction Rick
takes the Bilina ivory&mdash;" and southwest: "while Sheena returns
to her own forest. Sheena departs and takes her magic with
her."</p>

<p>Sheena laughed. "Sheena's magic is only that of the jungle. For
only the jungle has magic. The jungle knew from the first that the
white man, Lavic, came to steal from it, and thus he was doomed.
Poko Na, who went against the way of the jungle, was also marked
for death. The jungle has all it needs to perform its
magic&mdash;such as the poisonous karatonga which you were able to
find, and which Chim was able to drop in the vat of kaffir
beer."</p>
