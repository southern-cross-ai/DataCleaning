<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1">CHAPTER I</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">SHEENA lay unmoving on the bed of fragrant
grasses, her hands clasped behind her blonde head. A gentle
southeast wind blowing through the open door of the tree house
touched her with caressing fingers, whispered of a jungle long
awake and busy.</p>

<p>But this morning the murmurous jungle noises held no interest
for Sheena. A feeling of oppression and loneliness had gripped her
from the moment of her awakening.</p>

<p>A dozen times since sun-up her pet ape, Chim, had left his noisy
pursuits in nearby tree tops to peer worriedly in the door at a
mistress who would lie abed on such a wonderful day. Similarly, in
the clearing below, the great elephant, Tamba, stirred restlessly,
impatient and puzzled because the girl he looked upon as his own
private pet hadn't appeared for the ceremony of swimming, eating,
and playing over which he regularly presided.</p>

<p>For the first time, though, her animal friends weren't enough.
The usual joy she took in teasing, rough-housing and lecturing them
was gone. Even the familiar, deep cough of the powerful,
black-maned lion, Sabor, coming at intervals from across the river
failed to excite Sheena. She had raised Sabor from a cub, and
though he would wander away for days at a time, he always came
back, as he was doing this morning after an eight-day prowl, to dog
her footsteps for a time and cause trouble with the other pets
through his dangerous jealousy.</p>

<p>The jungle girl had probed without success for some explanation
of her depression. She knew that black men often were sick and for
a time she wondered if that could be her trouble, though the only
illness she had ever known was the stomach ache from eating too
enthusiastically of unripe fruit.</p>

<p>She had been laid up a few times with hurts suffered in life and
death battles with jungle beasts, but her feelings on those
occasions were totally different from the way she felt now.</p>

<p>Sheena's hair was blonde and long, her eyes a deep and startling
blue, her full lips as richly red as sunstruck rubies. Her skin was
tanned a soft, golden hue and she had the proud, lithe carriage of
a truly beautiful woman.</p>

<p>And yet actually Sheena had no understanding of beauty in the
terms a civilized woman thinks of it. Her body was pleasing to her,
yes, because in its firm, supple sleekness and sculptured lines,
she recognized the same qualities she admired in the great cats and
the arrow-swift antelope.</p>

<p>But as to whether she was attractive to men never entered her
mind. That basic feminine criterion of looks, the response of the
male, was a yardstick as yet unknown to her, for up to now Sheena
had never known a man of her own kind.</p>

<p>When she was younger the indistinct faces of a white man and
woman sometimes had come to her in her dreams, faces that were
familiar and yet somehow beyond the reach of her memory. Her
earliest memories were of the Abamas, over whom the old witch woman
of the tribe, N'bid Ela, had predicted that Sheena would one day
rule. To prepare her for that task, N'bid Ela had taken her into
the jungle and brought her up apart from the black children as
though she were a high priestess in training. But for many moons
now, N'bid Ela had been dead and a great, lost loneliness grew in
Sheena.</p>

<p>Formerly, there had been no blacks in Sheena's section of the
jungle, for the Abamas lived five suns to the south and they
continued to obey the dead witch-woman's taboo against invading
Sheena's privacy. "She will come to you when she is ready," N'bid
Ela had said.</p>

<p>But five moons ago the warlike Bambala had come suddenly from
the north and settled near her. In her first encounter with them,
Sheena had barely escaped capture. Since then, the blacks had made
sporadic attempts to hunt her down. Not wanting to cause a tribal
war, Sheena hadn't told the Abamas of her trouble, and more
recently now, the Bambala had left her alone and she had noticed
that on one of those infrequent occasions when she encountered a
hunter, it was the black who turned and fled.</p>

<p>BUT Sheena did not think of these things now as she lay
despondently on her bed of grasses. She thought of little except
that life was no longer good and exciting.</p>

<p>In the clearing below the treehouse, the elephant, Tamba,
trumpeted impatiently for her. Hardly had the ear-splitting noises
of his summons died away when her pet ape, Chim, landed with a loud
thump in the door of the house, scampered across the floor and
thrust his wizened, old-man's face close to hers.</p>

<p>Chim chattered softly, sympathetically to her at first. Then
getting no response, he fell silent, peered more intently with his
little button eyes. He turned away heartbrokenly, making sad sounds
in his throat as he plodded toward the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," Sheena muttered wearily. "I'll get up if it
will calm you wild dingos down. By the red eyes of Gimshai, why
can't you and Tamba tend to your own business for one day and leave
me alone?"</p>

<p>The jungle girl spoke the rapid, musical speech of the Abamas.
At the sound of her voice, Chim whirled, an almost human look of
delight wreathing his black little face. He began to bound up and
down like a rubber ball, chattering with wild animation.</p>

<p>Sheena stood up, smoothing and straightening her leopard skin
shorts and halter. She took her sheathed knife from a wall peg,
belted it on. Then she picked up a full quiver of arrows, fastened
it and a bow so they rested comfortably between her shoulderblades.
She scowled at the ape, and then with sudden animal quickness, she
mimicked him exactly, even to the sound of his voice.</p>

<p>The ape froze, his mouth open, his head inclined forward so that
he peered at her like an old man looking over the top of his
glasses. Then shrieking with pleasure, he turned and whipped
through the door, as if meaning to tell Tamba, the elephant, of the
wonderful joke.</p>

<p>Sheena came out on the small platform which served as a porch
for the treehouse. Two purple and gold virini birds whirred upward
from a nearby branch to the harsh scolding of a parrot. Ten yards
away in a great slanting column of sunlight, a cloud of butterflies
wheeled in an endless, dizzying dance.</p>

<p>The jungle girl looked down through the gently swaying pattern
of branches to where Tamba, with ponderous solemnity, was
scratching his tough hide against a tree. At the edge of the
platform lay a coiled length of liana, one end of which was tied to
a heavy branch.</p>

<p>With a sigh, Sheena nudged the rope into space with her foot.
She leaned over, caught the vine with her hands, and swung off the
platform, The swift, sure agility with which she shimmied down the
liana bespoke an unusual strength for a woman.</p>

<p>As her feet touched the ground, the elephant was waiting for
her. Tamba looked down at her from his great height, shifting his
ears like mammoth fans. Then he snaked his trunk about her, and
lifting her, swung toward the river twenty yards away.</p>

<p>"No, no, Tamba," she protested irritably. "Let me down. I don't
want to go swimming this morning."</p>

<p>The bull was at the edge of the water before he realized Sheena
was in earnest. He set her down, peered at her with the remarkably
intelligent eyes of his kind, seemingly trying to discover what was
wrong.</p>

<p>His look gave Sheena a twinge of conscience, and trying to hide
that fact even from herself, she turned away, stared stiffly
downstream. She immediately gave an exasperated grunt. Her glance
had lighted on a heavy, black-maned figure carefully working its
way over the river by using a low limb as a bridge. It was Sabor,
the lion, coming to make more trouble for her.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to put up with it," she said fiercely. "What do
these animals think I am, a slave?"</p>

<p>With a toss of her chin, she started across the clearing toward
the jungle. She heard Tamba shift his feet, knew he was considering
following her. Off to her right, Chim came somersaulting out of a
tree, landed on his feet and scampered to catch her.</p>

<p>"Leave me alone!" she cried. And suddenly she was running,
fleeing from her animal friends as though devils pursued her.</p>

<p>She sped into the cloaking green underbrush, careless of the
branches lashing at her. She ran on and on, halting only when her
breath began coming in hard gasps.</p>

<p>When she stopped and collected herself, she felt foolish and
ashamed. She shook her blonde head, a momentary wetness in her
eyes. What was wrong with her? Had she somehow caught the strange
madness which sometimes came upon animals, driving them off to live
in the bush alone, nursing a crazed anger against the whole
jungle?</p>

<p>SHEENA glanced around to get her bearings. She hadn't paid any
heed to the course she was taking and was surprised now to find how
far outside her usual hunting ground she had gone. Though there
certainly never had been any agreement made between them, there was
a vague line of demarcation between her own range and that of the
Bambala. The blacks themselves had more or less drawn the imaginary
line in the past few months and seldom penetrated beyond it.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, Sheena would have turned back immediately to the
safety of her own lands, but in her mood today she didn't care
about danger or anything else. She sat down heavily on a fallen
tree and put her head in her hands.</p>

<p>The sun crept to nearly midway in the sky before the jungle girl
finally got up. A hunger pain knifed through her, reminding her she
hadn't eaten that day. She was still standing indecisively, when an
errant breeze brought her the scent of ripening fruit.</p>

<p>In her life in the jungle, her sense of smell had become almost
as keen as an animal's. She went straight to the stand of trees,
heavy with large blue-skinned plums. When the taste of the plums
palled, she wandered on to some nut trees and finally topped off
her effortless meal with a yellow panyanox pear.</p>

<p>Just as she threw away the pear core, Sheena heard a distant,
echoing roar like a small blast of thunder. The sound was a
completely new one to her and she listened, frowning. Then twice
more the muted thunder came, seeming to roll close along the
ground.</p>

<p>Abruptly, all about her the jungle was listening. The small
rustlings in the underbrush, so faint and continuous that one grew
almost oblivious of them, suddenly stilled. The harsh voices of the
parrots, the trilling, liquid notes of the song birds ceased in one
velvet clap of silence.</p>

<p>The forest listened, weighing the danger in the alien sound.
Then as the noise blasted thrice again and still nothing happened,
like a music box slowly beginning to play, the activity of the
little creatures resumed. The strange thunder was ignored and then
forgotten by each animal or fowl the moment it decided it
personally wasn't threatened.</p>

<p>But because of that odd, restless quirk in the human mind, call
it a thirst for knowledge, or insatiable curiosity, or a plain
contrary urge to meddle, Sheena reacted quite differently from the
jungle animals. What did this new and different sound mean? What
caused it? Could it be there was something in the jungle she didn't
know about?</p>

<p>Eyes bright with interest, Sheena began running in the direction
of the continuing blasts of noise. She moved with an antelope's
grace, seeming to pick the quickest and easiest path by instinct.
There was no resemblance between the flashing drive of her long,
beautifully modeled legs and that knock-kneed, ridiculously aimless
attempt of a civilized woman to run.</p>

<p>In a matter of minutes, she came to a broad trail burrowing like
a dimly-lit tunnel through the choking growth of trees, shrubs and
vines. It was one of the ancient elephant tracks which serve as the
highways of Africa. The echoing blasts were very close now and
coming rapidly closer to her.</p>

<p>She started to step out on the trail, but her ears picked up the
sound of pounding feet. She drew back out of sight, and sensing for
the first time that she might be running headlong into danger, she
leaped high, caught a limb and drew herself up into a tree. She
found a perch in the middle branches, where she commanded a clear
view of the trail but would be hidden from sight herself so long as
she lay flat in a nest of vines.</p>

<p>A dark figure sprinted around a far curve in the path. A second
later, two more runners burst into view. Then a whole clot of
jostling, clawing bodies was pouring around the turn.</p>

<p>Sheena's eyes narrowed, her body suddenly taut. As the blacks
swept closer along the shadowed dimness of the trail, she realized
they were strange tribesmen, not the Bambala, her enemies. They
were obviously terror-stricken, each man fighting to get ahead of
the others.</p>

<p>None of them had the look of warriors, though the three men in
the lead were armed with spears and shields. Most of the natives
had heavy packs strapped on their backs, and as they ran, they were
tearing free of the carrying straps and letting the packs shatter
on the ground. Out of sight around the turn, the explosions were
sounding sharper and clearer now, each blast shocking the fleeing
natives to greater speed.</p>

<p>Sheena couldn't imagine what horror the panting, straining
natives fled from. Then, abruptly, when the stampeding blacks were
no more than a short spear throw away from both sides of the trail
erupted the dread Bambala war cry, "Babalo Aka N'Koto!"</p>

<p>That frenzied cry repeated over and over with hysterical
shrillness brought back to Sheena in a rush of memory that grim
morning when they first tried to capture her, swarming out of
ambush, a hundred jackals against one unarmed woman. But in her
they had met a raging, tearing leopard instead of a fear-stricken
victim. And on that day Sheena had killed for the first time, had
written in Bambala blood the first lines of the legend of the
warrior-queen which month to month from that time on was to grow
more fabulous.</p>

<p>"Blood for N'Koto!" Blood for the evil god of the Bambala! Blood
for that hideous, swollen idol before which the Bambala groveled
and prayed before they went out to hunt down innocent, helpless
victims.</p>

<p>Sheena snarled like an angry cat, her lips shearing back to
reveal bared teeth. Out of the underbrush along the trail, the
Bambala swept in two great waves. The ambush had been perfectly
planned. At point-blank range they hammered their spears into their
prey, and then ripping free their swords, they charged in to
complete their grisly work.</p>

<p>As the painted warriors fell upon the terrorized bearers,
Sheena's hand darted to her bow. All thought of her own safety was
gone. Rage, red and flaming, seared over her. It was but the work
of a moment to tug loose the slip-knot securing the bow across her
shoulders.</p>

<p>With the flashing speed that comes from long practice, she
snapped the bow-string taut, She leaped upright on the limb, as
perfectly balanced as though her feet rested on solid ground. With
nerveless precision, the jungle girl began feeding arrows into the
tightly packed attackers.</p>

<p>A Bambala warrior threw up his arms, and screaming, dropped to
his knees. Another pitched forward and was trampled underfoot. Two
more collapsed suddenly like puppets whose strings have been cut.
The fifth bent double, an arrow hammered completely through his
middle, and began to run in circles like a dog with his tail on
fire.</p>

<p>Sheena had concentrated her fire on the Bambala nearest to her,
those blocking the flight of the bearers. When she knocked those
five men out of the uneven battle, it was like stabbing a knife
into a water-filled bladder. The crazed bearers who had survived
the initial onslaught came spurting through the opening she had
created. In a blind, heedless stampede they drove out of the trap
and flung off at all angles into the forest.</p>

<p>The mass of Bambala splintered apart, groups of three to five
warriors taking out after each of the frightened human rabbits. The
attackers were raging more wildly than ever, now that an easy
slaughter had turned into a difficult chase.</p>

<p>But the warriors nearest those men dropped by Sheena's arrows
didn't join the pursuit. Some of them had seen the arrows rip into
their fellows, and jabbering excitedly, they pointed out to the
others that the attack had come from a new, hidden foe.</p>

<p>Then one of them, considering the angle at which the arrows had
struck, suddenly spotted Sheena standing wide-legged high up on a
swaying limb. He stabbed his finger at the slim, white figure
outlined against the deep green leaves.</p>

<p>"Tioto Nomi!" he cried. "The Forest Woman!"</p>

<p>A low, hoarse, shivering sound, like the rush of wind through a
deep gorge, broke from the Bambala. There was fear in that sound,
and hatred, too. This was the woman they had hunted innumerable
times without success. For all their numbers, all their weapons,
all their wiles, she made fools of them.</p>

<p>Clearly, no mere woman would be able to outwit warriors. And
there were other things that showed she was no ordinary flesh and
blood human. For instance, hadn't she been seen talking with fierce
jungle beasts, or hunting and playing with them. She had
demonstrated that she was immune to the curses and spells of the
witch doctors, to the proven juju which would wither and kill a
black man in a matter of days.</p>

<p>And yet at the same time, many happenings in the Bambala kraal,
such as the unseasonal windstorm two moons ago which tore off the
roofs of half the huts or the strange overnight invasion of snakes
after the last rain, could only be attributed to the evil magic of
someone like the Forest Woman. Surely, she was the spawn of demons,
endowed with a powerful personal juju, else the jungle devils
themselves would long ago have devoured her.</p>

<p>Fear does different things to different men. Most of the
warriors were momentarily paralyzed, stunned by the knowledge that
Sheena for the first time openly had invaded their lands and
attacked them. But one squat, bull-chested native was galvanized
into action.</p>

<p>"Save yourselves!" he screeched. "Strike before she kills
us!"</p>

<p>He tugged a spear from the body of one of the murdered bearers,
his eyes distended, his mouth a rubbery, gaping hole. He ran
forward two steps, hefting the spear for the cast.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2">CHAPTER II</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">SHEENA'S arrow took the spearman in the throat,
threw him flopping backward like a beheaded chicken. But the man's
action broke the spell which held the other Bambala. They went
scrambling for spears among the dead bearers.</p>

<p>Swift as she was, there wasn't time for Sheena to escape, and
against a massed spear attack her bow couldn't save her. Too late
she realized her deep-seated hatred of the Bambala had betrayed her
into fatal recklessness.</p>

<p>Then, at that moment, as death reached for her, three men came
fast around the far turn of the trail behind the warriors. Two of
them were husky blacks wearing faded khaki shorts. They clutched
rifles in their big hands, nearly empty cartridge belts slapping
their waists as they ran.</p>

<p>The third man was white, a tall, broad-shouldered fellow with
the driving, high-stepping gait of a football fullback. A rifle was
gripped in his hands, a pistol belted about his lean middle. He was
hatless, his black hair tangled and unruly. And though strain and
fatigue lined his square-jawed face, giving him at first glance a
deceptive look of maturity, a more searching inspection told that
he was in his very early twenties.</p>

<p>The two blacks faltered, broke stride, when they saw the Bambala
milling among the dead and dying bearers. Both of them, eyes
suddenly gleaming white, cast fearful glances over their shoulders.
The white man's voice lashed them, drove them on a few slowing
steps further. But the same panic that had overtaken the bearers
was fountaining up in the two guards.</p>

<p>As though invisible ropes had snared them, the guards stopped,
making futile little turns and twists without ever actually
stirring from their tracks, The white man's voice whipped them
again, angry urgency in it.</p>

<p>One of them shook his head violently, saying he wouldn't charge
the Bambala. The other gave no sign he even heard. For a desperate
moment the white man hesitated, then his mouth twisting bitterly,
he plunged forward alone, triggering his rifle from hip-level as he
ran.</p>

<p>His shouts to the guards had jerked the Bambala warriors'
attention away from Sheena. They gave cry like a dog pack when they
saw the three new victims. Two of them, spears lifting high, leaped
to meet the oncoming white.</p>

<p>Then the white man's rifle was bucking and jolting in his
rigidly straining hands. At that range even unaimed shots couldn't
miss. The crash of the explosions echoed and reechoed, sound piling
on sound, in the cavern-like trail.</p>

<p>One of the charging spearmen seemed to run into a stone wall. In
mid-stride he slammed against the unseen barrier, went reeling
backwards in a twisting fall. By the time he hit the ground, two
more men in the cluster of natives behind him were going down and a
third was screaming with a shattered arm.</p>

<p>These were tough, hard-bitten warriors, but this was their first
experience in facing gunfire. That terrible roaring firestick was
as awesome as a herd of charging elephants. Fearful magic was in a
weapon which in some unexplained way spat death through the
air.</p>

<p>And the best measure of the firestick's magic was the way the
lone white man ran straight at them. Only a man who knew he
couldn't lose would fling himself against overwhelming odds. Aye,
flesh and blood couldn't combat the magic of that firestick.</p>

<p>The Bambala didn't guess the colossal bluff the white man was
running on them. It took iron courage to drive at those blacks,
triggering the last of his rifle cartridges, realizing he was
finished if they didn't break before he reached them.</p>

<p>It wasn't lunatic bravery that dictated his action. The jungle
behind him was alive with Bambala. The main force had attacked his
safari from the rear, overwhelming over half the bearers before he
could bring his guns into play, stampeding the rest into this
second ambush. He knew he wouldn't have a chance against the
jungle-wise blacks if he turned off into the underbrush. The trail
ahead offered the only avenue of flight.</p>

<p>He had seen in the first moments of battle that the warriors
were gun shy. By fighting a fierce rearguard action, he and the two
armed blacks had tried to buy time for the bearers to escape. But
when their ammunition ran low, they, too, had been forced to run
for it.</p>

<p>Thinking of their nearly empty rifles, the guards' nerves had
broken when they rounded the turn and saw their retreat cut off.
The white man had gritted his teeth and plowed on. He had kept his
wits enough to realize that a bold front might panic the small
group of natives blocking the path.</p>

<p>And if his bluff failed?</p>

<p>Well, he would only be dying a few seconds sooner than the two
fear-stricken guards.</p>

<p>But his bluff didn't fail. Like jackals charged by a lion, the
Bambala suddenly took to their heels. In a trampling rush, they
headed into the underbrush, leaving the path clear.</p>

<p>Sheena stood frozen on the limb above the trail. She was as
startled by that thundering firestick as the natives, but she was
even more stunned by the fact that the firestick's master was
white-skinned. She didn't fear him. After all, he had saved her
life. His reckless charge had turned the Bambala spears away from
her in the nick of time.</p>

<p>It didn't occur to her that he could be anything but a friend
and ally. She judged men by the only rulestick she knew, the ways
of the animal world. Among the jungle creatures, like ran with
like, instinctively sharing the same hatreds, hungers, and
habits.</p>

<p>Early in life, Sheena reluctantly had concluded that she was a
creature alone, doomed to spend her days without ever knowing the
company of others like herself.</p>

<p>And now suddenly, unbelievably, she was seeing one of her own
people&mdash;a male of her own kind!</p>

<p>That he was a male, she had no doubt. His square-jawed face, his
broad shoulders, deep chest and lean hips, his deep voice and wild,
fierce manner of fighting, all bespoke his maleness.</p>

<p>He braked to a stop almost directly beneath her, and swung
about, hands busy with the firestick. The thing that had stopped
the white man was the hideous upthrust of Bambala cries on the
trail behind him. As he turned, fumbling in haste to jam the last
of his cartridges into the rifle, he saw black warriors pouring
around the turn and washing out of the jungle on both sides of the
two guards who had lagged behind him.</p>

<p>He jerked the rifle up, slammed five deliberate shots into the
swarming mass. But a score of marksmen couldn't have saved the two
men. The Bambala were on them like lusting beasts, literally
tearing the guards to pieces with their hands.</p>

<p>As the clawing, screaming mass closed over the two, the white
man's finger automatically kept working the trigger. But the five
shells had been his last and the hammer snapped futilely against an
empty chamber. When he finally realized what he was doing, his
right hand snaked for his pistol, his clean-cut face gone white
with anger under his deep tan.</p>

<p>Then with the pistol half out of its holster, he came to his
senses, realizing the uselessness of trying to challenge that
overwhelming force. He spun abruptly, and still gripping the empty
rifle, went pounding down the trail.</p>

<p>His action broke the spell which had held Sheena motionless. She
had seen him feed five glittering metal tubes into the firestick,
had heard it spit thunder five times and then emit only empty
clicks. The five ejected cartridges lay on the trail where he had
stood. Her quick mind fitted these facts together and suddenly she
realized the firestick's magic was used up.</p>

<p>The Bambala, already starting the pursuit, soon would also
realize the gun's magic was exhausted. And once the caution
engendered by their fear of that gun was gone, they would make
short work of the white man.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" exclaimed Sheena aloud. "I can't let them get
him!"</p>

<p>With flying fingers, she dropped the arrow she held back into
the quiver, secured the bow on her back. Then with the sure agility
of one of the tree people themselves, she started through the
middle branches.</p>

<p>It was through this trick of tree travel that she had so many
times mystified the Bambala, apparently vanishing into thin air
just when they thought they had her cornered. As a lonesome child,
she had begun imitating the monkeys and apes as strictly a matter
of play, and through endless practice gradually she had become
breath-takingly expert at aerial acrobatics.</p>

<p>In pursuing the white man, Sheena veered off to the left through
the jungle, remembering that the trail made a leisurely arc.
Despite his considerable lead on her, she would be able to
intercept him by making the shortcut.</p>

<p>When she reached her destination, she saw him a hundred yards
away, coming fast towards her. The Bambala weren't in sight yet,
but the clearness with which their chilling cries could be heard
told that they weren't far behind.</p>

<p>Sheena gripped a dangling length of liana, balanced to swing
down onto the trail. And then, with the actual moment of meeting
this strange male at hand, an overpowering shyness gripped the
jungle girl. She became aware of the rapid pound of her heart, the
swift rise and fall of her breast, and in her legs and the pit of
her stomach, she had an odd, quaky feeling.</p>

<p>She hesitated, bewildered by these new and utterly unexpected
sensations. Then angrily, she told herself, "You fool, don't cling
in this tree like a frightened lizard while death races up on that
brave man."</p>

<p>And with that, she leaped clear of the limb, went swinging down
onto the trail. Just before her feet touched the ground, she turned
loose of the vine and hit running.</p>

<p>As the man saw a figure hurtle out of the tree, he came to a
sliding stop, tearing his pistol from its holster. His eyes flew
wide as Sheena hit the trail, took three long running steps and
halted, facing him. His gun arm seemed to wilt, slowly dropping
back to his side.</p>

<p>"Good lord!" he said quite audibly. "A white girl!"</p>

<p>Sheena heard his startled exclamation, and though she didn't
understand the words, the sound of his voice was pleasant to her.
She saw too that her appearance had greatly confused and upset him.
She couldn't know that in addition to his shock at finding a white
girl in the midst of nowhere, he was suddenly frantic with the
thought that the responsibility for her life was being placed in
his hands when he couldn't hope to take care of himself.</p>

<p>His face was tragic as he stared at her fresh, young beauty. In
his mental turmoil, details such as her unusual dress or the odd
manner in which she had appeared didn't immediately make an
impression on him. His mind was too filled with the horror of the
Bambala attack for him to think logically. She was the most
beautiful girl he had ever seen and it sickened him to realize he
was helpless to protect her from the murderous blacks.</p>

<p>Then the girl was beckoning to him, dire urgency in her gesture.
He dropped the pistol back into his holster. He saw by her manner
that she was thoroughly aware of the pursuing blacks, but she
didn't show the least sign of fear. He tried to frame what he
should say to her, wondering whether to tell her right out how
scant were their chances or whether to lull her with a false sense
of security.</p>

<p>But before he could speak, she ran forward impatiently and
caught him by the hand. For the merest instant, her blue eyes
stared directly into his gray ones, seeming in their electric
intensity to search deep within him. She turned then, and gripping
his hand with surprising strength, tugged him into a run.</p>

<p>She kept a step ahead of him and he could no longer escape
seeing the bow and quiver of arrows tied across her shoulders. He
frowned, his mind struggling sluggishly with the fact that the bow
was polished by long usage; the primitive doeskin quiver worn with
much handling, His glance went to the long knife riding the curve
of her hip, noted that the ivory handle was shaped for a woman's
grip instead of a black warrior's broad, thick fingers.</p>

<p>And abruptly, a host of disturbing details about her began to
drop into place. He felt again the strength of her grip, watched
the supple play of firm muscles beneath her velvety skin, saw the
golden tan which covered her body. He noticed her leopard skin
clothing, which though worked to a beautiful softness, was yet
crudely cut and sewn. Her feet were bare and she wore not a single
ornament.</p>

<p>From the first few steps he took in following her, he could
sense she wasn't leading him in blind flight. There was a
confidence in her movements that assured him she had a definite
plan figured out. This wasn't what he had expected at all. Instead
of being a frightened woman seeking protection, she had taken calm
command of their escape.</p>

<p>She led him some fifty yards down the elephant track and then
swerved to the right into what appeared to the white man an
impenetrable wall of vegetation. But she wriggled with sure speed
through the vine-choked bush, twisting and turning right and left
as if by instinct to find clearance. Twenty paces off the main
trail he already had lost all sense of direction.</p>

<p>He abruptly realized the going was easier and found that she had
brought them to a tiny, winding game path. She turned loose of his
hand and began to sprint along the narrow way like a running
doe.</p>

<p>Branches slashed at his face, caught at his rifle as he tried to
keep up with her. Bushes gripped his legs, roots snared his booted
feet. He felt like a blind bull threshing through the jungle,
growing angry with himself as he saw how easily she threaded
through the undergrowth ahead of him.</p>

<p>He strained to the outermost limits of his strength to stay up
with her. Sweat poured from him in a drenching flood. His legs grew
unsteady and his straining lungs ached with effort. And to add to
his humiliation in being unable to match the girl, he finally
stumbled over the roots of a baobab tree and fell sprawling full
length in the path.</p>

<p>With the breath knocked out of him, he was too weak for a moment
even to get to his knees again. When he raised his head, he saw the
blonde girl had turned back and was staring at him, a questioning
look on her face.</p>

<p>"I'm all right," he growled sheepishly. "Blasted clumsy boots
are hard to run in."</p>

<p>She cocked her head at his words, but didn't say anything. He
realized she hadn't spoken a single time, and suddenly wondered
why. He heaved to his feet and managed a grin. He didn't want her
to think him ungrateful.</p>

<p>His weak grin immediately brought an answering smile from her.
She gestured to him to get started, and as if to reinforce her
warning that he must keep running, the savage howls of their
pursuers rose along their backtrail. He saw how swiftly the sound
of the pack erased her smile and knew the Bambala were dangerously
close.</p>

<p>His own features sobered. "Go on," he said, motioning her ahead.
"You mustn't lag back because I'm so damnably slow. By yourself you
can outrun them for sure. Forget about me and let me make out for
myself."</p>

<p>Sheena studied him thoughtfully, puzzling out his meaning. Then
setting her lips firmly, she marched forward and caught him by the
arm. It was obvious she had no intention of leaving him.</p>

<p>"Ohhh," he said despairingly, "all right, I'll go. You'd stand
here until they ran over us. But you're being plain foolish."</p>

<p>She started off again, this time adjusting her pace to his
ability to stay up with her. It angered him to realize this, to
appear a flabby weakling in her eyes, and he drove himself
unmercifully in an effort to crowd her, but always she kept the
same distance ahead of him, seeming to float effortlessly along the
difficult path.</p>

<p>He did his best, but it wasn't good enough. The measure of his
inadequacy was the growing speed with which the Bambala began to
overtake them. But lacking Sheena's animal-keen hearing, he didn't
realize how desperately close a handful of the swifter blacks had
come behind them.</p>

<p>Sheena knew that these warriors, the best runners of the tribe,
had long since outdistanced the pack. Only the confused winding of
the path concealed them from view; otherwise, they would have been
in easy arrow range.</p>

<p>She had doubled back onto the trail she had followed in first
entering the Bambala area, hoping that once she crossed the vaguely
defined border between her lands and theirs that they would abandon
the chase. But she had failed to take into consideration the white
man's difficulty in following her through the bush.</p>

<p>Because of his slowness, the blacks had cut away their lead. The
Bambala could tell from the white man's spoor that he was
staggering with exhaustion. With their prey almost in their grasp,
the frenzy of the chase submerged their hazy fears of Sheena. They
plunged across the border without hesitation, confident they could
make a quick and easy kill and get back to their own lands before
any harm could come to them.</p>

<p>When the warriors failed to turn back, a sudden chill touched
Sheena's heart. The man was doomed. Despite all she could do, this
black-haired, fair-skinned male of her own kind would be slain.</p>

<p>It would still be an easy matter for her to get away from the
Bambala. But all her jungle cunning was useless to help this man.
She heard him reel and clutch at a tree for support.</p>

<p>She stopped, turned back. His head was dropped forward on his
chest, his face contorted with the struggle to breathe. He sagged
against the tree for a moment, looking as though his legs were
going to give under him. Then through the wetness of his shirt she
saw his back and shoulder muscles tense and he shoved himself away
from the tree, came weaving toward her. She sensed the effort of
will behind that action.</p>

<p>Her blue eyes were dark with the decision she made. She put out
her arms and halted him. He swayed under the suddenness of her
grip.</p>

<p>Then slowly she stepped away from him, staring bleakly along the
way the Bambala would come. He wheeled about, watching her as she
reached for her bow.</p>

<p>Abruptly, understanding came to him. This strange, magnificent
girl, rather than abandon him to his fate, was preparing to face
their pursuers with no other weapon than her primitive bow.</p>

<p>The hoarse protest that burst from his lips was drowned by a
lion's ear-splitting roar. Before his amazed eyes, a huge,
black-maned lion burst from a stand of shoulder-high grass to
crouch facing them in the path. The beast was a giant of his kind,
a steel-thewed male in his very prime, his narrowed, yellow eyes
blazing with deadliness.</p>

<p>For the merest fraction of time, the white man was shocked into
immobility. It was as though a searing electric current stabbed
into him from the cat's yellow eyes. Then with a wild, warning yell
to the girl, his right hand dove for his pistol.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3">CHAPTER III</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BOB knew as he went for the gun how small a chance
he had of stopping the lion. But his instinct was to protect the
girl, and if nothing else, the shots would draw the brute's charge
to him.</p>

<p>Suddenly, bewilderingly, the blonde girl plunged at him, fought
his hand away from the pistol. A part of his mind dazedly
registered the fact that she was screaming at him in the Abama
tongue, not English. He understood the words easily for he had just
come from a long stay with the Nubutus, blood cousins of the
Abamas, who lived a month's trek to the west.</p>

<p>"No, no!" she said. "Don't harm Sabor! He's my friend! I can
control him."</p>

<p>He thought either he had gone crazy or he was dreaming the
granddaddy of all nightmares. Over the girl's shoulder he could see
the cat slink forward in slow, crouching steps, the unblinking eyes
riveted on his face. The realization came to him that the lion was
making no effort to charge the easy target made by the girl's back,
but was holding back, waiting with coiled muscles for her to move
out of the way.</p>

<p>He was the one the lion was after, not the girl!</p>

<p>The girl had wrestled him back against a tree. It was suddenly
all too much for the confused, bone-weary man. He quit struggling
for the gun, sagged back against the rough bark. At that moment, he
no longer cared whether he lived or died.</p>

<p>As soon as he relaxed, the girl spun around to face the black
maned cat. Keeping between the man and the slowly approaching
beast, she began to talk in a calm, firm voice. The lion's ears
shifted to catch her words, and after an interval, his glance
flicked from the man to the girl.</p>

<p>When she had the cat looking at her, Sheena went up to him. The
lion allowed her to stroke him, the deep-throated snarls changing
in tone, becoming complaining rather than chilling. She scratched
him behind an ear, slid her arm about his neck, and with gradual
pressure, turned the giant cat completely about on the trail. Still
keeping her arm around the brute's shaggy mane, she began to walk,
leading him away from the man. Before she had gone five steps, the
first of the pursuing blacks burst into view on the trail. The
warrior rounded a turn at a terrific pace.</p>

<p>The native had abandoned his spear to achieve greater speed,
feeling his sword and bow were weapons enough to handle the two
whites. He leaned forward as he ran, arms pumping, eyes glued to
the trail.</p>

<p>Sheena stabbed a hand toward the warrior, pygmy words spilling
from her lips. The huge lion beside her stiffened, his great head
lifting. Abruptly, the cat's tail lashed, a tremendous roar smashed
from his throat. Then with the blinding speed of a thunderbolt, he
shot down the trail toward the warrior.</p>

<p>The black's head jerked up as he heard the roar. His eyes seemed
to triple in size, his face blanching a dirty gray. With a wild
flailing of arms and legs, he managed to whip around and start back
toward the turn.</p>

<p>But at that moment, five more warriors running in single file
sprinted into view. The fleeing black hammered into the line of his
fellows, screaming, "Simba, Simba!" and clawing for his sword.</p>

<p>His cry of "Lion, Lion!" was no warning. All he succeeded in
doing was to send the first three men sprawling over him in a
confused tangle. The last two blacks did manage to keep their feet,
skidding to a stop just in time to make perfect targets for the
charging lion.</p>

<p>Sheena's savage pet shot completely over the fallen men and
landed with demoniac fury on the rear two warriors. Sabor's tearing
claws and fangs had ripped the blacks to shreds before he had borne
them to the ground.</p>

<p>The great lion wasted no time on his first victims. Barely had
his feet touched earth when he reared about and dove directly on
the fallen mass of men. He seemed to understand that he must strike
before the warriors could bring their weapons into play.</p>

<p>The watching white man was never to forget that awful scene. The
natives screams cut through the bloodcurdling snarls of the
maddened cat. The black-maned brute was everywhere at once,
leaping, twisting, spinning, striking down the terrorized warriors
before they could flee.</p>

<p>And suddenly it was over and the bloodstained lion stood among
the torn things that had once been men and cried his kingly rage to
the jungle. His one loyalty was to Sheena. Baring his fangs and
tossing his head, he roared defiance at all those who would harm
her.</p>

<p>The white man rubbed a hand across his eyes, muttered,
"&mdash;unbelievable&mdash;that devil obeying her&mdash;fighting
for her&mdash;" But it was only the first of the astonishing
experiences in store for him.</p>

<p>The girl's whole being had changed. Her eyes blazed with
excitement. She was no longer a person resigned to death. She ran
up to him, momentarily forgetting that he had spoken in a strange
tongue.</p>

<p>"Come!" she said exultantly in Abama. "They'll never catch us
now! Tamba is bound to be close by. Nothing but jealousy would have
made Sabor follow me this distance. He was afraid Tamba would get
me off to himself and he'd go to any lengths to keep that from
happening."</p>

<p>"I don't know who or what you're talking about," he answered
hoarsely, "but I darn sure don't want to stay here with that
lion."</p>

<p>SHE was pulling him down the path then, her darting eyes
searching the jungle about them. It was a full minute before she
realized that, except for a few strange words like "darn," he had
replied to her in the Abama language. She looked at him, a smile
like a burst of sunlight curving her full lips.</p>

<p>"You do speak as I do," she said happily. "My heart sank when
first I heard you speak in a strange tongue, for I thought you were
different from me. But we are the same&mdash;the same skin, the
same language, the same blood."</p>

<p>Uneasy wonder at the mystery of this strange jungle girl stirred
the white man again. She had the beauty of a goddess, the ways of a
wild creature. She was undoubtedly white, but spoke Abama as her
native language and seemed to have no knowledge of her own race at
all.</p>

<p>And this Tamba she spoke of, who was he? Another lion? Or was he
some hulking brute of a wild man. The thought of her belonging to
some man hadn't occurred to him before. He found he was oddly
disturbed.</p>

<p>"Are you sure this Tamba person will welcome me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Tamba?" she said, surprised. "He won't mind."</p>

<p>The white man wet his lips. "Uh&mdash;is he your husband?" He
had to ask it.</p>

<p>She repeated the Abama word for husband under her breath as
though she were unsure she had heard him aright. Then suddenly a
peal of delighted laughter burst from her throat.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said, her voice husky with laughter. "The sly old
lazybones has practically moved in with me and thinks he owns me,
but he's hardly the type for a husband."</p>

<p>The white man nervously cleared his throat, his face grown more
somber than ever. He failed to see any humor in the situation. It
was only further proof, he told himself, of how desperately little
he really knew about women.</p>

<p>He stared darkly at the ground, the trees, the leaf-obscured
sky, anywhere so he wouldn't have to look into those dancing blue
eyes. A damnable crime, he boiled silently. A young and beautiful
girl like that. Looked like the picture of innocence, too. Another
tragedy of environment, but probably it was far too late to do
anything about it now.</p>

<p>Her glad cry broke into his thoughts. "There he is! There's
Tamba! I knew he wouldn't be far away."</p>

<p>He looked grimly in the direction she pointed. For a moment,
since he was prepared to see a man, his glance registered nothing
but green shrubs with a huge, gray, rock-like mound vaguely visible
behind them.</p>

<p>Then the mound moved, shoved through the undergrowth with
amazing speed and quiet toward the girl, and with astonished eyes
he recognized a mammoth elephant.</p>

<p>"That is Tamba?" he sputtered. His face reddened as he became
aware of her laughing regard.</p>

<p>"We must hurry," she said, grown suddenly serious. "The Bambala
will be slowed down by the sight of those bodies and Sabor may pick
off another one or two, but so long as they have a spoor to follow
they'll stay after us."</p>

<p>The elephant had stopped a few paces away and was regarding her
with first one keen little eye and then the other.</p>

<p>"Here Tamba, lift him up," she commanded. The white man
retreated a step. "He won't hurt you," she said in an aside. She
reached out and patted the man on the shoulder for the elephant's
benefit.</p>

<p>"I don't feel like I can move," he said tensely, "but if it is
all the same to you I'll take walking rather than this." He took
another backward step away from the forest giant.</p>

<p>She beamed for the elephant, and said in a whisper, "Don't be
foolish. He's as gentle as a baby rabbit."</p>

<p>"Well, why are you whispering then?" the man demanded.</p>

<p>"I don't want him to get the idea you're afraid," she declared.
"He might not respect you."</p>

<p>"Oh, great!" he said. But under her serious, half-pleading look,
he found himself standing stiffly while the gray giant approached,
suspiciously investigated him with his trunk. The man thought of a
burly cop efficiently frisking a shady character. Maybe it was
imagination, but he also thought Tamba gave the girl a rather
aggrieved look.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, Tamba," snapped Sheena, "I'll explain everything to
you later."</p>

<p>THE next thing the man knew, the elephant's trunk had snapped
gently but securely about his waist and he was being swept high in
the air. By the time he had scrambled to a safe perch on Tamba's
back Sheena was settling herself on the broad head, slipping her
long, shapely legs down behind the beast's ears.</p>

<p>She drummed her heels, spoke a quick command, and the elephant
turned and went at a surprisingly fast gait down the path. The girl
sat the forest giant as though she were glued on, but the man
jounced, slipped and slid all over the swaying back. His first
experience with the ancient art of elephant riding couldn't be
termed a successful one.</p>

<p>For what seemed an eternity, he struggled to stay on that
lurching back. He was too busy trying with only two hands to hold
onto his rifle, clutch the rough, loose skin and block out the
branches that lashed at him with diabolical aim to pay any
attention to where they were headed.</p>

<p>When Tamba did stop, the white man's head was whirling dizzily
in one direction, his stomach in another.</p>

<p>The soft, little clucking sounds of sympathy Sheena made as she
helped him climb down touched his masculine pride. "Isn't this a
fine thing," he told himself angrily. "Here I am acting like a
maiden great-aunt, and she's as fresh and strong as when this
nightmare started."</p>

<p>She solicitously maneuvered him to where he could sit down and
rest his back against the tree trunk. He felt almost as bad as he
had once when he was sea-sick and he sat with his eyes closed
until she suddenly was holding a gourd of cold water to his lips.
He took a few cautious sips of the water and used the rest to bathe
his face.</p>

<p>He immediately felt better. He lifted his head to thank her. A
small black face with brilliant, glittering black eyes hung upside
down in the air not four inches from his own startled features.</p>

<p>"Uuugh!" he exclaimed and slammed himself back against the
tree.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry," apologized Sheena. "It's only Chim. He wanted
to get a good look at you."</p>

<p>And shame-facedly, the man realized the strange apparition was
nothing more than a small ape hanging from a limb by his feet.</p>

<p>He looked about at the pleasant, tree-shaded clearing, the
tree-house high above him, the cool, clear deeps of the river.</p>

<p>"You live here?" he asked unbelievingly. "And all alone?"</p>

<p>She nodded enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Chim, apparently tiring at long last of his upside down
position, loosened his grip on the limb, turned a quick flip and
landed in a squatting position in the white man's lap.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine how you manage," he said, trying not to notice
the monkey's stern, unblinking scrutiny. "How long have you lived
this way?"</p>

<p>"Why, always," she said matter-of-factly. "Doesn't everyone live
about the same way? Of course, I do live in a tree-house, whereas
most natives build on the ground. There's plenty of game and plenty
of water here. I don't think anyone could find a more perfect
home."</p>

<p>HE THOUGHT of the great crowded cities of America, the
unnumbered kinds of stores, services and establishments, the huge
manufacturing plants, the giant utilities, the layers upon layers
of governing bodies. And this slim, wide-eyed, blonde girl asked
him if everyone didn't live about the same way she did. An
existence such as hers, let alone a happy, healthful existence, had
become inconceivable to the white races of the world.</p>

<p>"Surely, you remember your family," he ventured.</p>

<p>A shadow seemed to pass across her face. "No," she said. "They
died while I was a baby. The Abamas found me, but they can tell me
nothing except that my parents were of the Tribe of God." The
expression was one used by natives to describe white
missionaries.</p>

<p>Grown suddenly moody, she bit her full lower lip, stared off
across the river. A wave of sympathy swept over the man. But the
girl's mood swiftly passed. She turned back to him, as bright and
vivacious as ever.</p>

<p>"You haven't told me how you are called," she said shyly.</p>

<p>"Great Scot," he exclaimed in English, "I really am the boy for
manners."</p>

<p>She blinked at him. "That is your name?"</p>

<p>He laughed. "No, no. My name is Bob Reilly."</p>

<p>She pronounced it after him cautiously, like a child learning a
new phrase. Then as if she had made a startling discovery, she
asked, "Why do you have two names?"</p>

<p>Without thinking, he returned, "Why not? Most people have
three."</p>

<p>She looked troubled. "I have only one&mdash;Sheena," she
confessed in a disturbed whisper. "I guess it is a bad thing to
have only one name?"</p>

<p>It dawned on him that she wasn't joking. In her first tentative
brush with civilization, he was unwittingly making her feel certain
"lacks" in herself. He sought to reassure her.</p>

<p>"The main reason for a name is so you'll be known and
remembered," he said. "As lovely a girl as you doesn't need more
than one name. There would never be a chance of your being confused
with any other girl. No matter how many Sheena's there were in the
world, once a man saw you, the name Sheena would never mean anyone
but you."</p>

<p>She gravely considered his words. It was the first male
compliment she had ever received. It hadn't occurred to her that
how she looked might have any effect on a man. She pursed her lips,
trying to figure out his exact meaning.</p>

<p>"You mean," she picked her words slowly, "that you find it good
to look upon me?"</p>

<p>Bob Reilly went through a considerable process of throat
clearing. He should have remembered that women were quite unable to
view any matter in the abstract. They dealt with everything on a
purely personal basis. He noticed how she leaned her head forward
and frowningly looked herself over as though wondering what there
could be that was particularly pleasing about her.</p>

<p>"Anyone would say that you are unusually beautiful," he said
with enforced calm. There, he had avoided the personal angle quite
neatly.</p>

<p>She smiled. You could see the pleasure grow in her. "I&mdash;I
feel quite different," she said, "from your saying that."</p>

<p>He found himself watching her apprehensively, and it was with a
distinct sense of relief that he saw her turn away, walk to the
river bank and lean over to study her reflection.</p>

<p>The monkey still squatted in his lap. He hadn't thought one of
the little varmints could stay quiet so long. Maybe the
frozen-faced devil was trying to hypnotize him. Bob stole a glance
at Sheena, and certain she wasn't watching him, he made the most
vicious, menacing face he could at the monkey.</p>

<p>Chim registered absolutely no reaction. He didn't turn a
hair.</p>

<p>Bob lifted his hands to his ears and waggled them in the
universally insulting gesture of brattish children. Chim's hard
little eyes didn't so much as move. Bob bared his teeth, made ugly
croaking sounds deep in his throat.</p>

<p>Then with insulting slowness, the monkey raised his own hands to
his ears, twisted his black little features into a leering grimace,
and mimicked the man's gestures with a brazen exactitude. When he
had finished, Chim made a sound suspiciously like a horse laugh,
leaped to the ground and went skittering off across the clearing in
high good humor.</p>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BOB leaned back against the tree and closed his
eyes. Too much had happened to him in too short a time. "If I don't
pull myself together," he told himself, "I'll be going off my
trolley permanently." His conscience was hurting him because he was
deliberately pushing away thoughts of the ambush and of what his
next move must be. But he realized he was too confused and beat up
to plan logically. The son of one of America's wealthiest men, Bob
at twenty-three, with a hat full of scholastic and sports honors
and an eagerness to get out and prove himself in the world, had
found himself faced with even more sterile, needless years of
study. His stepmother, as a means of getting him out from
underfoot, had convinced his father it would be well to send him
abroad for advanced schooling.</p>

<p>And the long submissive Bob finally rebelled. In an ugly scene
with his angry, desk-pounding father and coldly scornful
stepmother, he steadfastly asserted his independence, and ended by
stalking out of the house in a white fury.</p>

<p>Imbued with a desire to get away from everything representing
his old life, he recalled an expedition being organized by one of
his old professors to record and study native African languages. He
had demonstrated an unusual aptitude for languages in school, and
that talent along with his general record of scholarship and the
publicity value of his name, made it an easy task for him to get on
the expedition as an assistant.</p>

<p>After three months in the bush, the elderly professor's health
broke down and he had to return home, leaving Bob in charge. If
anything, the work went better under the younger man's direction,
and he began to feel he was going to show his father that he wasn't
the only Reilly who could pull his own weight under difficult
circumstances.</p>

<p>But his desire to include the more primitive and little-known
tribes in his study drew him into the trackless depths of
unexplored territory. He had known there was danger and had taken
what he considered were adequate steps to protect his safari. But
in his inexperience, he failed to realize the vast difference
between the fighting qualities of his long subjugated coastal
blacks and those of the fierce, marauding tribesmen of the
interior.</p>

<p>His guards and bearers were boastful enough about their fighting
prowess until trouble came. Then they fled in panic, abandoning
both packs and weapons. And so Bob's attempt to stand on his own
feet, to do something striking enough to impress his father, ended
in utter disaster.</p>

<p>"I've botched the whole thing," he told himself. "I'm a failure.
No expedition will give me a chance after this, and now my parents
will expect me to come crawling back to them. And I'll have the
blood of those murdered men on my hands the rest of my life."</p>

<p>It was these torturing thoughts that Bob tried to push away from
him as he sat in Sheena's clearing. At last his very weariness came
to his rescue. His chin dropped forward on his chest and he slid
away into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>Night had fallen when Bob awakened. A great silver moon lay low
in the sky. The moonlight washed the river with beauty, painted
shifting patterns on the ground beneath the tall trees. The weird
night chorus of the jungle rose all about the clearing.</p>

<p>Bob sat up in alarm, unable at first to identify his
surroundings. A fire, burned down to red coals, glowed in the
center of the clearing. He smelled the savory scent of a joint of
meat grilling slowly over the fire.</p>

<p>"Where the devil am I?" he muttered, hurriedly reassuring
himself that his pistol was still in its holster.</p>

<p>Nothing moved in the clearing. It seemed utterly deserted. Then
his glance caught on a dark bulk hunched not thirty feet from him
in the shadow of a tree trunk. He caught his breath and waited. The
dark bulk moved, and abruptly, two slanting yellow eyes burned
wickedly at him from the shadows.</p>

<p>A huge cat lay crouched there, watching him!</p>

<p>That sight swept the cobwebs from his brain. He remembered
Sheena and her savage pet. If Sheena had wandered off and left him
alone with that beast, he wouldn't have a chance. He felt cold
sweat trickling down his face.</p>

<p>What should he do? If he called out or moved, that devil might
charge. He recalled the stories he had read about intrepid hunters
playing dead when through some accident they had found themselves
at the mercy of a lion.</p>

<p>But even as he thought of these storybook heroes, he saw Sabor
flatten himself on the ground, creep forward a good two-feet on his
belly. He didn't feel the least bit intrepid at that moment.</p>

<p>"SHEENA!" he called loudly. "SHEENA!"</p>

<p>"Here I am." Her voice came from the direction of the river.
"What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Get this blasted lion of yours away from me! He's ready to
spring."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that all," she said, obviously relieved. "Don't worry
about Sabor. He wouldn't hurt you now for the world."</p>

<p>AT THE sound of his mistress' voice, Sabor stood up and looked
toward the river. The instant those yellow eyes were off of him,
Bob was up and around behind the tree against which he had been
leaning. Once out of sight of the cat, he streaked for another
tree, further away. When he reached it safely, he began to work his
way toward the water with all the care of an infantryman under
heavy fire.</p>

<p>He reached the bank muttering. A hasty glance over the
moon-swept water failed to reveal any sign of her. He looked over
his shoulder. Sabor was moving toward him with slow steps, pausing
every few feet to sniff the night air.</p>

<p>Bob turned back toward the river just in time to see Sheena's
head break the surface of the water. Of all the cold-blooded women,
he thought. She amuses herself by swimming around under water while
her man-killing pet stalks me.</p>

<p>She saw him in the moonlight. "I was beginning to think you
never would wake up," she said. "Come on in the water. It feels
wonderful. The meal won't be ready for awhile yet anyway."</p>

<p>With Sabor stalking him, there was no room in Bob's mind for the
proprieties. In nothing flat, he had tugged off his boots and
stripped to his shorts. Cats, even big cats, didn't like water. He
would be safe in the river.</p>

<p>Bob took two running steps and drove out over the water in a
racing dive. He drove out toward mid-stream with a smooth powerful
stroke, leaving a frothing wake.</p>

<p>"How swiftly you go," she exclaimed as he swam up to her. "Like
the finny ones themselves! Oh, if only I could swim that way! I've
studied every animal I could, trying to learn better ways of
swimming, but none of them can match you."</p>

<p>He had meant to lecture to her about Sabor. But he found himself
saying almost moderately, "You've got to do something about that
lion. Didn't you realize he was creeping up to kill me?"</p>

<p>"Faugh," she said mildly. "On the trail&mdash;yes&mdash;he would
have killed you. But now he understands you're my friend. He's been
lying there looking at you since long before dark. After all, he
never saw a white man before and he's kind of interested."</p>

<p>"I tell you he even came creeping after me down to the river,"
insisted Bob. "I don't like him and he doesn't like me."</p>

<p>Sheena laughed. On the shore the black-maned lion coughed
irritably. Both the man and the girl glanced toward him. He was
standing with his head high, staring out at them over the
water.</p>

<p>"Well, Sabor probably thinks we would be better off without
you," she confessed, "but I told him you belonged to me and to
leave you alone. And he'll do it!"</p>

<p>Bob's mind had stopped dead on the words, "I told him you
belonged to me." He was suddenly puzzled. What was going on in the
head of this wild, young, pagan girl?</p>

<p>The next thing he knew she was swimming so close to him that he
could feel the touch of her bare leg against his as she treaded
water.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking about what you said to me this afternoon,"
she suddenly declared.</p>

<p>Her eyes were disturbingly large and luminous in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>"What was that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"About you finding me good to look upon," she explained. "That
made me very happy. I couldn't really understand what you meant at
first," Sheena went on. "I've never been around any men of my own
kind, so it hadn't occurred to me that&mdash;well&mdash;that they
might like me or not like me."</p>

<p>"Yes. Quite so," Bob said uneasily. "Don't you think you should
look at the food?"</p>

<p>Sheena's face was instantly sympathetic. "Oh, I forgot," she
said. "I'm not used to having visitors. You must be starving."</p>

<p>Before he could move, she had thrust her feet against the river
floor and stood up. He realized for the first time that she swam
unclad and her suddenly revealed beauty made his breath catch in
his throat. Her bare body was a picture of Aphrodite rising from
the sea.</p>

<p>Sheena waded to the bank. With a child's innocence, she stood
there smoothing the glistening drops of water from her body with
her hands. After leisurely donning her halter and shorts, she
walked across to the fire and inspected the joint of meat cooking
over the crossbars.</p>

<p>When Sheena called him to eat, Bob dressed hurriedly in the
shadow of a tree and joined her near the fire. The food was
delicious and he ate huge quantities of it, but actually he hardly
tasted it or knew what he was eating.</p>

<p>Never in his life had Bob felt such conflicting emotions about
anyone as he did about the jungle girl. He kept stealing glances at
Sheena as she moved back and forth from the fire, waiting on him,
or while she sat cross-legged beside him, eating with unconcealed
enjoyment. She shone with happiness.</p>

<p>And suddenly he realized that he was happy too. By all rights,
he felt he should have been wallowing in the depths of despair. He
was lost in the depths of an untracked jungle, hunted by murderous
tribesmen, left without any adequate means of protecting himself.
Yet never had he felt so vibrantly alive as he did now.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5">CHAPTER V</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE raucous argument of parrots on a limb above
him awakened Bob in the morning. He had slept near the fire, using
a zebra skin thrown over freshly-cut grasses for his bed. The
moment he sat up, his eyes went to the tree house high above
him.</p>

<p>He realized that his first thoughts were of the blonde-haired
girl. "This won't do," he warned himself. "I'm supposed to be a
serious, intelligent adult." He got up and began to pace the
clearing, forcing everything out of his mind but his wrecked
expedition. He had to decide what to do.</p>

<p>He could be a quitter, write off the expedition as a total loss
and concentrate on trying to get out of this scrape with his own
skin whole. Under the circumstances, that didn't seem too
illogical.</p>

<p>But Bob kept remembering that a good part of the records of the
expedition were in those packs abandoned by the bearers. The
Bambala were certain to gather up the packs, cart them back to
their village as loot. Until he knew those records were definitely
destroyed, he felt bound to try to recover them.</p>

<p>Then, even though the cowardice of his blacks was the real
reason for the debacle, he considered it his duty to go to the help
of any who had survived the attack. The Bambala wouldn't have
slaughtered them all. Once certain their victims were too
terrorized to fight back, they would have begun taking
prisoners.</p>

<p>And after an hour of pacing and fretting, he made up his mind.
He wouldn't be able to live with himself if he didn't make a
sincere attempt to free the surviving bearers and retake the
records he had so painstakingly gathered. Yet even as the resolve
was formed, he felt himself doomed to failure.</p>

<p>How could he, with a handful of pistol cartridges and an abysmal
ignorance of the jungle, hope to strike any kind of a blow against
the savage Bambala?</p>

<p>Bob was surprised to see Sheena suddenly stride from the jungle.
He had thought her still asleep in the tree house. She leaned her
spear against a tree, walked over and stirred the fire to life.</p>

<p>"I left early," she said. "I thought it wise to check on the
Bambala." She knelt, placed four fresh sticks of wood in the
flames.</p>

<p>"The Bambala didn't turn back as I had hoped," she said
abruptly. "They are searching for us now."</p>

<p>SHE loosened a leather pouch belted about her slim waist, laid
it on a clean rock beside the fire. Then, after selecting a long,
pointed stick from a collection held in a large gourd, she reached
in the pouch and drew out a freshly cleaned and dressed bird. She
held it up for him to see before she spitted it on the stick for
cooking.</p>

<p>"I thought these birds might please you for the morning meal,"
she said. And so he would understand they were something special,
she added, "I hunted for them quite awhile."</p>

<p>The girl utterly baffled Bob. She seemed to have dismissed the
black warriors from her mind. After learning those murderous devils
were searching them out, how could she calmly go hunting and then
come back to enjoy a leisurely meal.</p>

<p>"The birds look wonderful," he said without enthusiasm. "But
frankly, Sheena, shouldn't we be getting out of here instead of
thinking of eating?"</p>

<p>"Leave?" she said, surprised. "This is my home!"</p>

<p>"You can't fight off a whole tribe," he told her.</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed. "I can cause them enough trouble to make them
wish they hadn't come. I've done it before."</p>

<p>"But they'll come back, Sheena," he said gravely. "And they'll
keep coming back until one day they'll catch you."</p>

<p>She fitted the spitted birds onto the forked supports which held
them over the fire. She stood up and brushed her hands. The merest
shadow crossed her face.</p>

<p>"Death must come to every living creature," declared the girl.
"I will not be afraid when my time comes." She spoke with the
fatalism of those to whom danger is a constant companion.</p>

<p>"Is there a way, Sheena," he asked suddenly, "for me to circle
around these warriors and reach their village? I'd guess that most
of the able-bodied men are hunting for us. This might be my best
chance to slip into their village and try to free any of the
bearers who were captured. If there are enough of them and they'll
help me, maybe I can even recover my records."</p>

<p>Sheena turned in alarm. Though she had talked calmly enough of
death in regard to herself, she now exclaimed, "Are you trying to
kill yourself? You must be mad to speak of such a thing!"</p>

<p>He blinked at her, taken aback by her reaction. She paced
rapidly back and forth in front of him.</p>

<p>"I haven't the least desire to get anywhere near that village,"
he admitted honestly, "but it is my duty to do it."</p>

<p>"Duty? I do not know this word!" She was like an aroused
leopard, lithe and quick, with a wildness in her eyes. "I will not
have you put yourself in danger. I will not have it, you
understand!"</p>

<p>Bob scratched his head and frowned. He hadn't anticipated
anything like this.</p>

<p>"It's all right for you to play dangerous games with the
Bambala, but not me. Is that it?"</p>

<p>She gave her long blonde hair a savage toss. "I am different,"
she snapped. "I am Sheena!"</p>

<p>She reached him with quick steps, shook a finger in his face.
"Put this notion from your head. You are not to go anywhere near
that kraal of dangos."</p>

<p>"You saved my life, Sheena," he answered gently, "and I'm deeply
grateful, but I'm not a new pet who will meekly do your bidding.
There are some things a man must do if he is to live with
himself."</p>

<p>And he tried to explain to her then why he had to make a stab at
helping the bearers and recovering the work of many months.</p>

<p>"You owe those men nothing," she told him with harsh, feminine
logic. "They did not value their freedom enough to fight for it. As
to this work you talk of, I do not understand about it too much,
but it can't be important enough to lose your life over."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I must go," he said firmly.</p>

<p>She was very close to him. The changeful blue depths of her eyes
softened, losing the storminess of a moment before. The warm, girl
scent of her came up to Bob.</p>

<p>He watched the curve of her full, red lips. Her teeth were small
and fine and white. He had never known any woman who stirred him as
she did.</p>

<p>Suddenly the tight control he had exerted over himself snapped.
Before he knew what he did, he reached his arms about her and
pressed his mouth to hers.</p>

<p>The startled girl's eyes flew wide. She stiffened as though
either to fight or run. But she let him draw her into his embrace,
made no attempt to take her mouth from his.</p>

<p>Abruptly he released her, but he could not move away because she
held him with the rigidness of her arms about his neck.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Sheena," he mumbled, "I shouldn't have done that.
I&mdash;I didn't mean to do it." He was embarrassed and angry with
himself. "I only meant to tell you that though I wish I never had
to see another Bambala, I have to go to their village."</p>

<p>Sheena slid her arms from his neck and stepped back. The
strange, startled expression was still on her face. Her right hand
came up to touch her mouth.</p>

<p>"Why did&mdash;what did you do?" she faltered.</p>

<p>Bob frowned, momentarily puzzled. Then he was more embarrassed
than ever. Sheena had no idea what a kiss was.</p>

<p>"I kissed you," he said. And then he didn't know what to say
next.</p>

<p>"But why?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Uh&mdash;well, I just couldn't help myself." His face reddened.
"Among our people, when a man?" That didn't sound right. "It's a
custom. It&mdash;it means&mdash;no, that's not what I want to say."
He bumbled on in a growing confusion of unfinished sentences.</p>

<p>"You mean," Sheena asked, "that among people with white skin it
is like when a native man rubs noses with a girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he granted uncomfortably. He considered how swiftly
feminine instinct had taken her to the heart of the matter.</p>

<p>"I have seen them," she said thoughtfully. She touched her lips
with her fingers. "This is a strange thing, this 'kiss,' very
strange." Then slowly, she smiled and nodded her head. "But it is
far better than the natives' custom. I think our people must be
very wise. First, there was the firestick which kills at a
distance, then the superior way of swimming, and now this
matter."</p>

<p>"Then you aren't angry with me?" ventured Bob.</p>

<p>She contemplated him gravely. "No," she said softly. "I should
like you to do it again, now when I wouldn't be so surprised."</p>

<p>Bob swallowed heavily. "Not now," he declared. His breath came
very fast. "No, not now." He might have proved himself a sorry kind
of man by making a mess of his expedition, he told himself, but
he'd be damned if he was sorry enough to take advantage of Sheena's
innocence. She had saved his life. The least he could do was to
behave himself.</p>

<p>SHEENA sighed, tapped a forefinger against her teeth for a few
moments.</p>

<p>"Do not worry, Bob. If you must go through with this Bambala
foolishness," she said in unexpected capitulation, "Sheena will
make you a plan. You sit here and rest. Fretting is not good for
you."</p>

<p>He was relieved to know she wasn't going to continue her
opposition, though he didn't take seriously her easy assurance that
she would provide a plan. She was an unusual girl, but a foray such
as he contemplated was rather out of a woman's line. He was amused
by her swift shift from the role of a naive, young maiden to that
of a wise elder mothering a child.</p>

<p>But later, after they had eaten, when he still hadn't laid hold
of the vaguest notion of how to carry through his project, she
calmly and confidently told him how the job could be done.</p>

<p>She said, "This will work&mdash;if anything will. I know the
Bambala, how they think. And fortunately for us, only women and old
men will be in the kraal."</p>

<p>Bob listened in amazement. Never in a thousand years would so
unorthodox a scheme have occurred to him. But, by George, it might
work. It was bold and dangerous, yet properly executed it could so
stun and frighten the tribesmen that he would have time to free his
bearers and gather up his records before a hand was raised against
him.</p>

<p>Then his face suddenly fell. Tamba was the keystone of the whole
plan, which he realized on second thought meant that Sheena was
counting herself in on the raid.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he cried. "You're taking no part in this. The plan
won't do. I'm not risking your life on business that just concerns
me."</p>

<p>Sheena regarded the determined set of his jaw and smiled.</p>

<p>"You're mistaken," she said mildly. "The fight is entirely
yours. I mean only to help you get ready for it and guide you to
the village. If I order it, Tamba will do your bidding well enough
to get you through."</p>

<p>Bob subsided. "Well, that's different," he said. "I won't have
you running any more risks on my account. Look at the trouble I've
already caused you."</p>

<p>Throughout the day, Bob kept worrying that they should leave the
camp, but Sheena refused to be hurried. After several trips into
the jungle to gather a strange assortment of bulbs, roots, and
dank, yeasty growths, she had settled down to mixing a white,
glue-like substance.</p>

<p>"Chim and Sabor are keeping an eye on the Bambala," she told
him. "They'll let us know when the dangos get too close."</p>

<p>Bob didn't share her confidence in the two pets. And the fact
that Chim would get bored about every two hours and return to camp
to see what Sheena was doing didn't help his nerves. After the
jungle girl had chased the grumbling ape back to his post for the
third time, she made a further confession to ease Bob's
tension.</p>

<p>"I laid enough false trails this morning to keep the Bambala
busy until nightfall, unless they should get very lucky," she
explained. "And scattered along each trail are unpleasant little
surprises to discourage them from hurrying."</p>

<p>She didn't go into detail about the surprises and he didn't ask
her to, for her grim tone brought crowding into his mind the
variety of murderous traps he had seen black men use in hunting:
camouflaged pits, drawn bows released when a vine in the path was
touched, tiny, poisoned bamboo splinters set in the earth, snares
that would jerk a grown bushbuck eight feet in the air and break
its neck, bent saplings that would hammer a lion into pulp.</p>

<p>But the revelation of how she had occupied the early morning
shook him as badly as had the realization that Sabor, far more than
a pet, was a deadly weapon she employed against her enemies.</p>

<p>When he looked at her now, he saw a young, mild, soft-voiced
girl, anxious to please, quick to laugh. He felt at ease with this
girl. In truth, he felt pleasantly superior. Then abruptly, she
would shatter this mould into which he had fitted her, revealing by
some action that she was more a sister to a tawny, dangerous
lioness than the conventional being he tried to believe her to
be.</p>

<p>How could he reconcile the shy, soft-mouthed girl he had held in
his arms for a moment that morning with the Sheena who could meet
and best the black warriors at their own savage game?</p>

<p>It made him almost afraid of the girl. You couldn't guess what
really went on in that head of hers or predict how she would react
in a given situation. How could he be sure she wouldn't turn on
him, if he made a move that rubbed her the wrong way?</p>

<p>Sheena was too busy to notice any change in him. Not until late
afternoon did she plug up with a stopper of wadded leaves the last
of five large gourds of the thick, whitish liquid. She glanced at
the low-lying sun and then came over to where Bob sat, then
stretched out on her side on the ground beside him.</p>

<p>She smiled up at him, her head cushioned on her right arm. "The
night ahead may be long," she said simply. "I will rest until Chim
comes. He would never forgive me for leaving him behind."</p>

<p>She closed her eyes, took a few slow, deep breaths and was
immediately asleep. Bob blinked in amazement. "That's not human,"
he told himself. "She even sleeps like a cat."</p>

<p>He set his jaw firmly and looked away into the jungle. But in
less than a minute his gaze had crept back to the sleeping form
beside him. He studied the way the long, blonde hair tumbled about
her face and shoulders, examined the long lashes lying heavy
against her golden skin, watched with something more than
scientific interest, the manner in which her red lips pouted in
sleep.</p>

<p>The daylight was nearly gone when Bob realized with a start that
Sheena's eyes were open and that for some time she had been
silently watching him.</p>

<p>His confusion wasn't lessened when she said, "Chim grows
impatient with my laziness."</p>

<p>As though ear plugs had been drawn from his ears, he suddenly
heard a monkey chattering and grumbling in the tree above them. How
long the little devil had been there he didn't know, but apparently
for a considerable period. And though Chim had made enough noise to
rouse Sheena from sleep, Rob hadn't even been conscious of his
presence.</p>

<p>"It was nice to awaken and find you sitting beside me," she
said, putting a hand on his arm. "But I couldn't help but wonder
what you were thinking that made you frown so."</p>

<p>He got up quickly, avoiding her gaze. "I was thinking of the
raid," he lied.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said quietly. And he had a queer feeling that she was
smiling inwardly.</p>

<p>WHILE they waited for it to become full dark, they ate a light
meal of fruit and nuts. Then Sheena called Tamba, and tied the
gourds on him so they wouldn't rattle or spill. Like the low,
distant rumble of thunder, came the roar of a lion. After a brief
interval, answering cries from widely separated points in the
jungle could be heard.</p>

<p>"The Bambala are close, but they won't do much more traveling
tonight," said Sheena grimly. "That first roar was Sabor's victory
cry, telling the jungle he had made an easy kill. Every cat within
hearing will head for that area. I think we can move safely
now."</p>

<p>And so in the pitch blackness before the moon rose, Tamba
carried them along secret trails past the Bambala patrols. Bob, who
had worried about the nervous, talkative Chim going along with
them, noticed that the monkey huddled in front of Sheena and never
uttered a sound. He was about ready to believe that the jungle
girl's pets did understand what was going on.</p>

<p>It was after midnight when Sheena halted the elephant in a
moonlit glade. "We'll do our work here," she said. "The kraal is
within arrow shot."</p>

<p>She unfastened the gourds, detached two of them, and lowered the
others carefully to the ground.</p>

<p>"I'll paint his head and back," she told Bob. "You take care of
his legs and stomach."</p>

<p>A half-hour later the patient elephant had been smeared
completely over with the thick, white liquid brewed by Sheena. But
in the darkness, the liquid revealed a property not discernible
during daylight. It glowed with an eerie, phosphorescent light.</p>

<p>Bob stood off and looked at Tamba. "By Harry," he exclaimed,
"he's the most unearthly-looking sight I ever hope to see. And that
hazy, bluish glow makes him look twice as big as he is. A creature
like that looming out of the night would frighten anyone."</p>

<p>"The Abama witch woman who brought me up used it in her magic,"
explained Sheena. "I often helped her gather the materials and mix
it."</p>

<p>Bob looked at his hands, glowing with light from the mixture he
had smeared over the elephant. "I believe it may work," he
excitedly declared, "if the Bambala are as superstitious as you
say."</p>

<p>"Let us hope so," the girl said quietly. "There will be danger
enough at best."</p>

<p>Sheena had picked up the vine rope which had been used to tie
the gourds on Tamba. As she talked, she idly toyed with it, forming
loose coils on the ground with one end, twisting and gathering the
other end in an odd pattern.</p>

<p>"Well, this finishes your part of the job, anyway," said Bob.
"You've been wonderful to help me."</p>

<p>He tried to tell her how grateful he was, but he seemed suddenly
clumsy with words and his voice took on an unnatural
brusqueness.</p>

<p>He finished lamely by saying, "I'd better paint myself up now.
And then as soon as you get me started off on Tamba, I want you to
get away from here&mdash;and stay away. You've taken too many
chances on my account already."</p>

<p>Sheena didn't look at him. She kept her head down, her fingers
nervously working with the rope. "Yes, Bob," she said.</p>

<p>She seemed small and feminine and terribly forlorn in the
moonlight. The sight of her caught Bob's heart and twisted it. He
had been a rotten, miserable heel to think of her as he had that
afternoon.</p>

<p>He couldn't leave her this way. He had to take her in his arms,
tell her how he felt about her. He took two steps towards her.
"Sheena," he said hoarsely, "before I go&mdash;"</p>

<p>As though her mind had been turned inward and she hadn't heard
him, she suddenly interrupted. "The paint, Bob&mdash;it must be dry
before you mount Tamba. Hold out your hands and let me see if it is
drying properly."</p>

<p>Her taut, businesslike tone, so out of harmony with the mood
that had swept over him, stopped Bob in his tracks. Almost angrily,
he shoved out his hands for her inspection.</p>

<p>As to what happened next, he was to try many times afterwards to
recall exactly how it did occur. But he was never to be entirely
certain about any of it.</p>

<p>Sheena leaned as though to inspect his hands. The next thing he
knew the vine rope she had been idly fingering snapped about his
wrists. "What the devil?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Before he could realize what she was about, Sheena leaped
backwards, the rope running through her hands with the speed of a
striking snake. Then she flipped the rope, gave a powerful
tug&mdash;and Bob's feet shot from under him.</p>

<p>One end of the vine was lashed about his wrists, the other about
his ankles. There had been careful planning behind all her
nonchalant handling of the rope while they talked. The loops she
had thrown on the ground with seeming carelessness were those she
flicked upward to lash his ankles, send him crashing to the
ground.</p>

<p>Despite the stunning force of the fall he took, Bob lashed out
wildly, trying to break free. After darting in to snatch his pistol
from its holster, Sheena stood a safe distance away, watching him
struggle. He fought like a maddened beast, his sanity momentarily
splintered by the terrible shock of her treachery.</p>

<p>But the bonds held, and at last he lay gasping, his muscles
trembling from the violence of his efforts. Only then did he look
at her, letting the bitter acid of his wrath spill out in
words.</p>

<p>"And to think I believed in you, trusted you," he snarled. "I
should have known you'd turn on me like an animal if it were to
your advantage."</p>

<p>His mouth was a vicious slit, his eyes narrow pools of hate. His
gun made a dull thump as she dropped it at her feet.</p>

<p>"You fooled me, though," continued Bob. "I swallowed all your
hocus-pocus, never suspecting that you'd use me to buy your own
safety. Very clever! You hand me over to the Bambala and thereby
buy them off of your own trail. They were getting too close for
comfort. And you got to worrying that if I did raid their kraal and
did some damage, they'd never forgive you for helping me."</p>

<p>Sheena smoothed her hands nervously over her midriff, her face
expressionless except for the eyes which seemed to glow in the
night. Finally, her right hand slid to the knife riding the curve
of her hip. The blade gleamed coldly as she lifted it from the
sheath.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BOB was abruptly still as he saw the bared steel
in the jungle girl's hand. Then with withering contempt, he said,
"Don't lose your head, my precious. The Bambala won't pay as much
for me dead as they will alive. They, too, enjoy the pleasure of
killing!"</p>

<p>A deep, pained frown cut Sheena's forehead. She had foreseen
everything in her planning except Bob's reaction. The awful
bitterness of his words took her by surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, I play a hard trick on you," she said evenly. "But I play
it to save your life, not take it away."</p>

<p>She turned her back on him. The gray trunk of a dead tree stood
at the edge of the clearing some thirty paces in front of her. She
covered half the distance to the tree with quick steps. Then Sheena
lifted the knife, sent it glittering through the air to drive
point-first into the dead wood.</p>

<p>Bob had lifted himself with difficulty to a sitting position. He
watched her fling the knife into the tree and hurry back to where
Tamba waited.</p>

<p>"What did you mean about saving my life?" he demanded.</p>

<p>She picked up the remaining half-gourd of phosphorescent paint,
literally poured it over her head and shoulders, saving back enough
to douse the protesting Chim. Then she painted both her spear and
bow.</p>

<p>"I meant I am going in your place!" she snapped, rapidly
smearing the paint evenly over her. "Foolish one, Tamba would never
take your orders, and besides, I know far more about handling the
Bambala than you do."</p>

<p>He stared at her aghast as she signaled Tamba to lift Chim and
her to his back. "You intended this from the beginning?"</p>

<p>"Of course," she said, "if your men and packs can be wrested
from the Bambala, I will do it. If I fail, then you will still be
able to save yourself."</p>

<p>"No!" he burst out indignantly. "I won't allow it!"</p>

<p>He was working clumsily with his fingers to loosen the bonds on
his ankles. Since Sheena had tied his hands in front of him, he had
no trouble reaching his feet.</p>

<p>"I tied you so you'd have to allow it," she said calmly. "And
don't waste your strength trying to undo those knots. You'll need
my knife to get free. By the time you work your way over to that
tree and get it loose, it will be too late for you to interfere at
the kraal."</p>

<p>Sheena lifted her pet ape, dropped him to the ground,</p>

<p>"However, on second thought I'll leave Chim to help take care of
you. The noise he's making would work me harm, but his voice and
looks should protect you from anything less than a rhino."</p>

<p>She tried to force a light-hearted gayety into her tone, but the
attempt wasn't wholly successful. "I go now!" she said abruptly,
lifting her spear in an odd, quick salute.</p>

<p>Then Tamba was moving past Bob, bearing Sheena into the jungle.
He pleaded with her not to go, nearer in his utter helplessness to
tears than at any time since his early childhood. Sheena, sitting
ramrod straight, didn't look back.</p>

<p>As the dark, green foliage closed behind her, Bob's voice
trailed away brokenly. He thought of things he had said to her in
anger and was ashamed and miserable. She was going into that
village for him and only because of him.</p>

<p>He had called her an animal, immediately attributing the basest
motives to her. He remembered the hurt, surprised look on her face
as she heard his accusations. Yet she hadn't even rebuked him.</p>

<p>In that moment, the certainty crystallized in him that he would
never see Sheena again. She was riding to her death!</p>

<p>In one writhing effort, Bob heaved himself to his feet. He had
to get free and catch her. He reeled, his legs so tightly bound he
couldn't balance himself.</p>

<p>To keep from falling, he started hopping forward, each clumsy
hop swifter and more desperate than the preceding one. But his
convulsive efforts to regain his equilibrium were doomed to
failure. He got no more than five yards before he crashed heavily
to the hard earth.</p>

<p>The fall knocked the breath from him, yet he immediately fought
to his elbows and knees. He heard a weird gibberish sounding right
at his shoulder. He jerked his heel around and saw Chim crouched on
hands and knees beside him. The ape, his eerily glowing face
seemingly wreathed with diabolical delight, was trying to assume
the same position as Bob.</p>

<p>The distraught man's temper exploded. "I'll teach you to mock
me," he shouted. And he reared up on his knees, lifting his bound
arms to knock the ape rolling.</p>

<p>But Chim divined his purpose instantly. With an alarmed screech,
the ape bounded backwards and fled off across the clearing like
some small, incandescent demon. Bob shook his knotted fists in
futile, senseless rage.</p>

<p>CHIM literally flew over the ground, his little head twisting
right and left in search of a safe refuge. The gray outlines of the
dead tree caught his attention as it had Sheena's when she looked
for a place to plant the knife. The ape headed for the tree. He
scrambled up the trunk in mad haste, shooting past the knife to
reach the bare lower limbs.</p>

<p>Not until then did he pause to look back. His staccato outburst
revealed surprise that the man hadn't moved. He fell silent,
considering the matter. Then deciding he was quite safe, his whole
manner changed and he began climbing slowly down the tree, grandly
announcing his outrage at being put upon like a common fellow.</p>

<p>When Chim reached the knife, he suddenly stopped his tirade. He
recognized the scent of his beloved mistress. He gave a delighted
cry and tugged the knife free.</p>

<p>He beamed on the weapon. It was Sheena's. He would return it to
Sheena and she would be pleased with him. She was always very proud
of him when he returned some belonging of hers that he found. In
fact, if the truth were known, he often stole her belongings so he
might return them and have her pleased with him.</p>

<p>His run-in with Bob had slipped as completely out of Chim's
erratic little mind as had his memory that Sheena was gone. His
head didn't trouble itself very often to try to hold more than one
notion at a time.</p>

<p>He dropped from the tree and scampered happily back toward Bob.
He was within three yards of the man when he realized Sheena was
nowhere in sight. Chim had been too angry about the white paint
being poured on him to pay any attention to Sheena's departure, and
after that, Bob's antics had so engrossed him that he still didn't
realize he had been deserted.</p>

<p>All at once now it was borne in on him that his protector was
gone and that the terrible night so feared by the tree folk kept
him from finding her. Chim was suddenly frightened. He looked about
at the dark trees, imagining fearful enemies staring at him.</p>

<p>Bob had no idea what went on in Chim's mercurial mind. The white
man crouched on his knees, his breath coming in hard gasps. The ape
had the knife. That was all that mattered.</p>

<p>From the moment Chim had pulled the knife from the tree and
started back toward him, Bob had been afraid to speak or move. He
had to get the weapon from the little devil. But how? After the way
he had treated the monkey, a word or movement from him would
probably send Chim fleeing into the forest.</p>

<p>He wet his lips nervously, "Here Chim! Good boy, give me the
knife." He uttered the words like a prayer. "Nice boy. I won't hurt
you."</p>

<p>Chim, who had hunkered down into a little glowing knot, lifted
his head and stared mournfully at the white man. Then he ducked his
face and shivered.</p>

<p>Bob kept talking in the gentle, wheedling tone. The monkey
wouldn't budge. Bob gathered his courage and edged forward a few
inches. Without even lifting his head, Chim edged backward an equal
distance.</p>

<p>Bob groaned. He'd never get the knife, never in the world. The
little fool understood and obeyed every word Sheena spoke, yet at
this moment, when so much depended on it, he wouldn't heed a single
thing Bob said to him.</p>

<p>And then abruptly, Bob realized that in his excitement, he had
been speaking in English. With his voice trembling with excitement,
he switched to the Bambala tongue.</p>

<p>Chim straightened, cocking his head to listen. He seemed to feel
better immediately. He began to chatter and moved cautiously in
towards the man.</p>

<p>Bob was careful to make no sudden moves. Not until the ape had
snuggled against him did he gently reach for the knife. To his
relief, Chim seemed actually happy to give the weapon up. Bob's
face and hands were bathed with sweat and he was shaking as he cut
away his rope bonds.</p>

<p>He shoved the knife under his belt, ran to where Sheena had
dropped his pistol. Then gun in hand, he raced toward the point
where the jungle girl had left the clearing, praying that he would
be able to follow her in the dark.</p>

<p>He was in luck for once. Tamba had left a clear trail where he
had forced his way through the undergrowth, and within a distance
of twenty yards, Bob hit a broad trail, From the angle at which the
elephant had slanted into the trail, there was no doubting the
direction Sheena had taken.</p>

<p>AS HE started to run, a hysterical jabbering broke out behind
him. Chim, refusing to be abandoned, came rocketing out of the
underbrush and in an amazing leap, fastened himself on Bob's back.
He hugged himself against the white man so tightly, his small heart
pounding with fright, that Bob couldn't bring himself to throw him
off.</p>

<p>"All right," growled Bob. "You can play Old Man of the Sea until
we come in sight of the kraal. Then you're going back on your own!"
And with that, he sprinted on down the trail with redoubled
effort.</p>

<p>After Sheena left Bob tied in the clearing, she turned her whole
mind to the task ahead of her. By the time she reached the Bambala
kraal, the final details of her plan were perfected.</p>

<p>The walled village lay silent and sleeping in the waning
moonlight. If there were sentries posted, they rested listlessly
out of sight, lulled by the long, monotonous hours of early
morning. The campfires had died to ash-whitened coals. Sheena had
carefully selected this as the most propitious time for her
raid.</p>

<p>The jungle girl urged Tamba straight up to the big main gate. In
these first few moments, boldness would be her most valuable
weapon. When the elephant slowed his pace before the gate, not yet
understanding what was expected of him, Sheena drummed her heels
behind his ears, drove him head-on against the massive barrier.</p>

<p>"Forward, O Mightiest of Elephants," she encouraged him. "Let
these jackals know your strength."</p>

<p>There was a splintering impact. For a moment, the mammoth bull
seemed to hesitate. Then the big gate tore free of cross-bars and
hinges, and fell inward with a mighty crash.</p>

<p>And Tamba, exhilarated by the exploit, lifted his trunk and
trumpeted in ear-splitting challenge to all comers as he carried
his mistress into the kraal.</p>

<p>Two guards who had been dozing on a catwalk beside the gate,
crouched frozen on their knees. Their eyes gleamed out of the
darkness like great, circular bulbs as they stared at the ghostly
apparition sweeping into the kraal.</p>

<p>"Tremble, you curs," cried Sheena, gesturing toward them with
her spear, "for the curse of doom is on you! I, who am the servant
of Gimshai, dread god of death, proclaim this doom on Bambala!"</p>

<p>Of all the fearsome jungle deities, the all-powerful Gimshai
struck the greatest terror into the hearts of black men. And as
every native knew, the servants of Gimshai appeared in a thousand,
thousand different forms, and struck at their chosen victims in
unnumbered ways.</p>

<p>The terror of one of the guards was so great that after hearing
Sheena's words he toppled forward senseless on the platform. The
other man, quaking in every muscle, jerked upright on the platform.
Mindless, nerve-tearing screams ripped from his throat.</p>

<p>He literally dove off the catwalk, hit the ground with
bone-breaking force. But fear anaesthetized any physical hurt he
sustained, and he was on his feet and running immediately,
streaking down the main way of the kraal.</p>

<p>The guard's screams ripped the blanket of sleep from the
village. Commands, shouts, the sound of running feet boiled up from
the dark clusters of huts. Dazed men and women poured from narrow,
skin-hung doorways.</p>

<p>And into the very middle of this suddenly aroused ant-heap rode
Sheena. Straight down the principal way of the village she went,
looking to neither right nor left, the one completely calm,
collected person in all that howling throng.</p>

<p>She and the mammoth elephant seemed enveloped in a swirling,
blue-white haze of light. Tamba seemed even more immense than he
really was, and the din of his steady trumpeting, inspired by
excitement and the scent of the Bambala, was indeed like the sound
of doom.</p>

<p>As the blacks, crowding out to learn the cause of the
disturbance, saw that white, statue-like figure that was Sheena,
the loud furor died away like a fading echo. A low, frightened moan
that could have been the keening of the wind over a wasteland swept
back and back through the massing natives.</p>

<p>Then Sheena's voice, harsh and savage, was heard. "From the
Black Hole of Death, from the Skull-Throne of the Terrible God
himself, I bring you the curse of Gimshai.</p>

<p>"Look at me, O members of a jackal-tribe! Look at me and
tremble, for I am the Clawed Hand of Gimshai; I am the Net of the
Eater of Souls; I am the Sword of the God of Death."</p>

<p>Her words drove into the minds of the Bambala like poisoned
darts. Had she rehearsed her speech to Bob Reilly he would have
thought it suicidal nonsense. But Sheena knew how to open the
floodgates of fear in her audience.</p>

<p>The entire existence of these wild and primitive natives was a
web of superstition. Any strange or unexplained phenomena they
attributed to gods or demons. And their over-active imaginations
seized on every untoward event and embroidered it with supernatural
significance.</p>

<p>Even now as they gazed at the strange, chalk-white she-demon,
their imaginations swiftly added a variety of details to what they
thought they saw. There were some who saw in the whiteness of her
face the clear outlines of a death's-head. Others saw her long
hair, stiffly encrusted with white liquid, as a mass of pale
squirming snakes. Some would say afterwards her eyes were hollow
black sockets, others that they were red coals of fire.</p>

<p>It would be said that the spear in her hand squirmed and
wriggled like a living thing, that the eerie, elephant-like
apparition she rode was no more than a mist through which one could
see, that rivulets of cold flame ran outward along the ground where
the creature's feet were placed.</p>

<p>Sheena's audience was especially impressionable on this night
when practically the whole of its fighting strength was absent.
Excited by their triumph of the previous day, every warrior eagerly
had sought to join the hunt for Bob Reilly and the jungle girl.</p>

<p>Left behind in the kraal were the untried youths, the men too
old or sick for trekking, and the easily frightened mass of women
and children.</p>

<p>Sheena had counted on the absence of the real fighting men as a
major help in the carrying out of her colossal bluff.</p>

<p>Now as she heard the whimpering of the women, saw the crowd edge
backward away from her, she boldly rode into the central clearing,
abandoning any hope of retreat. She knew the crowd would mass
around the open space, and if she were found out, that wall of
humanity would prevent her from ever reaching the gate alive.</p>

<p>After the habit of the Bambala, both the prisoners and the loot
gained in their attack on Bob's safari were kept on display in the
clearing. The miserable bearers were crowded into a foul,
make-shift pen like animals, and stacked near the enclosure were
the packs they once had carried.</p>

<p>The great feast and the ceremony of dividing the spoils which
always followed a battle triumph were being delayed until Bob and
Sheena were captured.</p>

<p>Sheena headed the elephant toward the pen, wanting to free the
prisoners and march them out of the kraal before the stunned
tribesmen could collect their wits.</p>

<p>But suddenly two of the large cooking fires in the clearing
flickered into life. Yellow tongues of flame reached along the
edges of the dry wood which had been thrown hastily on the coals.
Sheena understood then the purpose of the commands that had sounded
in the first uproar of her entrance, for revealed in the mounting
light was a hollow square of armed guards grouped about two men,
the two most important men in the tribe.</p>

<p>One was Babuli, the immensely fat chieftain of the Bambala, a
brutal, self-indulgent tyrant. The other was Nyag-Nyag, a tall,
thin, one-eyed man with a hatchet face and the hunched posture of a
crouching weasel.</p>

<p>Nyag-Nyag was the Bambala witch doctor, and more than any other
member of the tribe, he had reason to hate Sheena, for time and
again the most potent magic he could make against her had proved
ineffectual.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">SHEENA instantly was disturbed when she saw the
two tribal leaders with the ranks of hard-bitten guards ranged
about them. She certainly hadn't counted on their presence.
Improvising to meet this unexpected danger, she hastily changed her
plans and halted Tamba.</p>

<p>Gesturing contemptuously with her spear, she cried, "Hai! So now
I look upon the two chief jackals!"</p>

<p>The elephantine Babuli clearly was more shaken by her ghostly
appearance than the witch doctor. "Why&mdash;why&mdash;have you
come here?" he asked weakly.</p>

<p>Sheena was silent for long, ominous moments. Then like the crack
of a whip her voice lashed him. "I come to take your soul to
ever-lasting torment! Even now, Gimshai wrathfully awaits your
coming!"</p>

<p>The mammoth chieftain stumbled back a step, his great belly
quivering. The harsh confidence with which she spoke turned his
blood to ice.</p>

<p>"There is some terrible mistake," he quavered. "Never by word or
deed have I shown disrespect for Gimshai! Aaiiee, he is the
greatest of gods! In all the jungle, no one has sent him more souls
than Babuli."</p>

<p>"It's too late to lie," Sheena said grimly. "You honor but one
god, N'Koto, god of war, and it is he who has led you to your
downfall. Two suns ago you made a cowardly attack upon the safari
of one who holds the special favor of Gimshai. The Taker of Souls
reached out his hand and saved this white man, saying for the
destruction you had wrought you would pay with your life. And so I
have come to exact payment!"</p>

<p>Babuli seemed to be choking. His eyes stood out like round, red
marbles. Poisoned by a lifetime of superstition, he felt that
already the life-force was being sucked from his body, that the
fluttering in his throat was his soul struggling to escape.</p>

<p>"Talk to her! Appease her!" he gasped to the witch doctor. "You
know more of gods and demons than I do. Promise
anything&mdash;anything&mdash;if she will let me be."</p>

<p>With his one good eye, the witch doctor had been glaring at
Sheena. He was not as naive as Babuli, nor as superstitious as the
other tribesmen. He had practiced too much trickery and deceit,
pawned off too much humbug as magic, to be taken in easily by
Sheena's tricks.</p>

<p>He sensed something familiar in this ghostly intruder, noted
also how she sought to keep back out of the firelight. It seemed to
him that every time an especially high leap of the flames lighted
her mount that its eerie blue-white glow disappeared.</p>

<p>Yet because he was both a cunning man and a coward, Nyag-Nyag
proceeded with care.</p>

<p>He pushed through the ranks of warriors, picked a blazing stick
from the fire. He lifted the torch high as though to clearly light
himself for Sheena's eyes.</p>

<p>"Hear me, O One Who Walks the Night," he said in a false,
fawning voice. "I make no plea for my worthless, unimportant self,
but I do plead for the noble Babuli."</p>

<p>He edged nearer to Tamba as he talked, narrowly watching the
effect of the torchlight on the elephant's glowing whiteness.</p>

<p>"Never would Babuli knowingly offend the dread Taker of Souls,"
he continued. "If a wrong has been done by Babuli, he stands ready
to make any gifts, offering or sacrifices the god decrees.
Intercede for us, O Great One, and the Bambala will honor you
endlessly. Help us to right our unmeant wrong! You have only to
speak."</p>

<p>Relief surged through Sheena as she listened to Nyag-Nyag's
abject beseeching. The feeling that she had triumphed lessened her
wariness, so that she failed to divine the witch doctor's purpose
in coming so near.</p>

<p>"Gimshai is merciful, as are his servants," she said haughtily.
"If you have the courage to accompany me into the Black Hole of
Death to plead your case before the god himself, you may do
so&mdash;remembering that if you fail, there can be no return."</p>

<p>Nyag-Nyag seemed to debate before muttering, "I have the
courage."</p>

<p>Sheena stared at him. "But you must approach Gimshai with clean
hands." She gestured at the imprisoned bearers and stacked loot.
"You must give up the spoils of your cowardly attack. You must free
the bearers and give them back their arms and you must furnish men
to carry these packs to their destination."</p>

<p>The huge-bellied chieftain, who had been bathed in sweat as he
waited for Sheena's answer, literally shouted his acceptance of her
terms. He was concerned with his own safety only, and cared not a
whit that he might be sending a large group of his followers to
their death.</p>

<p>"All shall be as you say!" Babuli shouted hoarsely, not wanting
to give the witch doctor time to back out of his bargain. Then he
turned to his guards in the same frenzied haste, crying, "Release
the prisoners! Gather men enough to carry the packs! Quickly, you
curs!"</p>

<p>But even as the chieftain spoke, Nyag-Nyag sprang back away from
Tamba, swirling the torch about his head. "No!" he roared. "Let no
man move."</p>

<p>BABULI was so aghast that it took him a moment to find his
voice. His body quivered in outrage at this treachery. "I am
chieftain here," he croaked.</p>

<p>"You're a fool, Babuli," snarled the witch doctor, "as blind and
stupid a fool as all these others!"</p>

<p>It was in Nyag-Nyag's mind that after tonight he would never
again have to bend his knee to the fat chieftain. What he was about
to do would make Babuli a laughingstock at the same time that it
enhanced his reputation as a wizard.</p>

<p>"Because I amuse myself by toying with this faker," the witch
doctor said, pointing at Sheena, "don't take my acting seriously.
She is no demon, no servant of Gimshai."</p>

<p>"What are you saying?" squeaked the chieftain, seeing his
chances of salvation being shattered before his eyes.</p>

<p>Nyag-Nyag laughed, thinly baring his yellow teeth. "I'm saying
this supposed demon is merely Tioto Nomi, the Forest Woman. I'm
saying it takes more than children's tricks to fool the jungle's
greatest wizard."</p>

<p>Dismay had wrenched Sheena stiffly upright. But her reaction was
no different from that which shook Babuli and his tribesmen. The
witch doctor's words had exploded with the violence of a
thunderbolt.</p>

<p>"You madman!" wailed Babuli. "You'd get us all killed. You know
as well as I that our warriors are pursuing Tioto Nomi far across
the jungle."</p>

<p>Nyag-Nyag had backed close to the guards. He tossed away his
torch, took a spear and shield from one of the blacks. Then he ran
out into the open space between Sheena and the warriors.</p>

<p>"Watch this test, my simple Babuli," he sneered. "And you need
not faint from terror, because the risk falls on me alone." His
whole manner was supremely confident. "A thousand shields would not
protect me from a servant of Gimshai, because such a servant would
be able to kill with a glance&mdash;a sign&mdash;a thought."</p>

<p>The ugly laughter bubbled from his lips again. After tonight,
his name would ring through the jungle.</p>

<p>"But one shield is protection enough against Tioto Nomi," he
said, "because her only weapon is her spear. She has no magic
powers. Watch while I prove it! And stand ready, guards, to strike
her down when she betrays herself by trying to use her one, puny
weapon."</p>

<p>Sheena sat stupefied, a knot of panic growing and spreading in
her breast. The cunning, one-eyed dango had trapped her. She sought
in futile desperation for some means of escape, knowing full well
that the game was played out.</p>

<p>Nyag-Nyag was leaping and dancing in front of her, always
careful to protect himself behind the thick, heavy shield of rhino
hide. "Quickly, Tioto Nomi," he taunted, "loose your terrible
magic. Kill me with a look! Kill me with a thought!"</p>

<p>A stifling hush gripped the kraal. In the shadows around the
central clearing, black men crouched, afraid to breathe. Babuli
leaned forward, his face like gray paste, his mouth hanging loosely
open.</p>

<p>"Come, O Would-be Demon," the prancing wizard jeered, "I wait
for you to strike. Why do you hesitate? You try my patience, make
me weary of this farce."</p>

<p>Sheena's mouth was dust-dry. The death she had sought to save
Bob Reilly from was to be hers. And now he was to be lost to her
finally and forever.</p>

<p>As ominous muttering stirred the watching blacks. Nyag-Nyag's
ridicule was having its effect. Already the guards were edging
forward, their hands tightening on their spears.</p>

<p>Sheena's own spear arm tensed. Her bluff was finished. At least,
she would take a few of them with her. She gritted her teeth,
prepared to send Tamba charging into the guards.</p>

<p>Nyag-Nyag's gloating laughter rang high. "Hear me, Tioto Nomi,"
he shrilled. "I spit on you and on your fathers! What greater
insult can one give?"</p>

<p>His prancing and his high-pitched screams were too much for
Tamba. The huge bull elephant lifted his trunk and trumpeted with
ear-splitting violence. The very air shivered with the raging
sound.</p>

<p>Nyag-Nyag looked up startled. Then a very strange thing
happened. The hatchet-faced wizard gave a queer backward leap as
though he had been struck a powerful blow. His face twisted in
agony and he staggered.</p>

<p>He let the spear drop from his fingers, and the weight of the
shield slowly drew his left arm down to his side. His stringy
muscles began jerking and twitching.</p>

<p>His single eye bulged with terror. Then his long thin legs
started to buckle. All at once his mouth strained wide and a great
wash of blood rushed from his lips.</p>

<p>That was the end. Nyag-Nyag toppled forward on his face and lay
still.</p>

<p>Tamba fell silent at almost that same moment. It was
unbelievable that a native kraal could be so still. And in that
profound hush, you could feel terror sweep like a black wind over
the stunned natives.</p>

<p>Sheena was as shocked as the tribesmen. She stared blankly at
the dead wizard. She hadn't moved a muscle to harm him, yet there
lay the hated Nyag-Nyag, stiffening in death.</p>

<p>What miracle was this? What invisible power had reached out in
her hour of need to strike down that human dango?</p>

<p>But the jungle girl was given no time to dwell on that mystery.
Babuli's hysterical screams jolted her alert. The hog-fat chieftain
had crumbled to his knees and was beseeching her not to kill him,
not to blame him for Nyag-Nyag's blasphemies. Tribesmen all about
the clearing were groveling in abject terror.</p>

<p>They thought she had slain the wizard!</p>

<p>SHE moved swiftly to take advantage of the situation. Though so
upset herself that she could barely keep her voice from trembling,
Sheena sternly repeated the demands she had made before. And this
time the prisoners were immediately freed and Babuli's disarmed
guards hurriedly loaded themselves down with the stolen packs with
no thought of opposing Sheena.</p>

<p>Babuli collapsed in a blubbering heap, but Sheena delegated four
of the bearers to prod him to his feet with their spears. The
remaining bearers she placed along both sides of the pack-laden
Bambala.</p>

<p>"Now trek," she shouted. "And any man who causes trouble will
join Nyag-Nyag in his ever-lasting torment."</p>

<p>Her threat sent the column through the kraal at a stumbling
trot. All idea of resistance was gone from the Bambala. As she
urged Tamba after the bearers, the natives pressed their faces in
the dirt, afraid to look at her.</p>

<p>Once outside the kraal, she forged to the head of the column,
leading it back along the trail toward where she had left Bob
Reilly. But before she had gone very far, she heard a frantic
chattering, saw an eerie, glowing little figure come skittering
down the dim path toward her.</p>

<p>"Chim!" she cried in surprise, and with a quick command, she had
the elephant swing the little ape up beside her.</p>

<p>Chim bounded into her arms, fairly sputtering with delight at
finding his mistress again. Then Sheena's keen ears heard another
sound. She looked up to see Bob advancing out of the darkness. Her
initial thought was that he might still be angry at her.</p>

<p>But there was unutterable relief, not anger, in his voice as he
exclaimed, "Thank heavens you're out of that place at last! You
were crazy to take such a chance, but it was the most wonderful
thing I've ever seen."</p>

<p>"You mean you saw what went on in the kraal?" she asked,
surprised.</p>

<p>"I not only saw&mdash;thanks to Chim, not you," he said, "but I
took a small part in the proceedings. I'll frankly admit that I
could never have pulled off the bluff you did."</p>

<p>He told her then how when he reached the kraal the witch doctor
had just begun to taunt her. Since the natives were all
concentrated in the center of the village, he was able to enter the
gate unobserved. He had sneaked close to the clearing, and climbed
up on a pile of wood stacked beside a hut.</p>

<p>With his pistol, he had blasted Nyag-Nyag. The sound of the shot
had been covered by Tamba's wrathful trumpeting. And the unholy
fear that had struck into the Bambala when they saw their witch
doctor die had kept them from suspecting that any hand but
Gimshai's had slain Nyag-Nyag.</p>

<p>"So you were the one who saved me," she said wonderingly.</p>

<p>Bob laughed. "I believe I could say the same for you."</p>

<p>They were a mile further down the trail and the false dawn was
graying the sky when Sheena halted the elephant.</p>

<p>Bob sat behind her on the forest giant's back. "What do we do
now?" he asked.</p>

<p>She gave him a long, searching look. "You will take Babuli and
his guards with you and see that they are punished. You'll have no
more trouble with the Bambala, so you can easily reach white man's
country with your records."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;aren't going out with me?" Bob was
surprised and confused.</p>

<p>"This is my own land," she said, gesturing toward the dark
jungle with her hand. "There are many things I can do to make it a
better land. I have found myself tonight, as the old witch woman
once prophesied I would."</p>

<p>Her head lifted and she looked up at the brightening sky.</p>

<p>"But you can't stay here, a lone girl," said Bob. "I've grown
very fond of you, Sheena. I want you to go with me. I thought that
you and I..."</p>

<p>"Even if I wished it," she interrupted him gently, "I could not
go with you. I am a priestess and more to the Abamas. They have
been awaiting the day when I would be ready to lead them. And now I
am ready. It would mean your certain death if you tried to take me
away."</p>

<p>And so it was that a frowning, unhappy man a few minutes later
watched Sheena ride away alone toward the Abama kraal. He stood
there with the soft warmth of her good-bye kiss on his lips, vowing
that Abama warriors or not, he would be back as soon as his trek to
the coast was finished.</p>
