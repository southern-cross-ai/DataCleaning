  <h2><a name="ch-0"
     id="ch-0"></a>PROLOGUE.&mdash;THE PLAYERS ARE SET</h2>

  <h2><a name="ch-0-1"
     id="ch-0-1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">The place was a lonesome one&mdash;lonely on a large scale.
There were
  cottages near in twos and threes, an inn not a quarter of a mile away, a
  wheelwright's shop and a Primitive Methodist chapel, but Ferriby Grange found
  no company in these.</p>

  <p>The loneliness was beyond the recognition of most: the old house stood
  bereft of its kind, lonely for the days of joyous mirth and plenteous
  fullness that had so long ceased to be.</p>

  <p>There was only one friend left of all&mdash;one true old friend, and that
  was the sea, and even the sea had changed. From the flat roof you looked out
  now upon a different coast-line and looked afar; the sea was three miles
  further off than in the days when the rough wall was built&mdash;to keep it
  at bay. Ah, but the sun was the same and the winds, only they for that very
  reason, perhaps, scarcely seemed to ward off loneliness. When the sun touched
  the eastern windows on a May-day morning, radiant faces were no more there to
  peep over upheld flowers for the greetings of the sweethearts below, and at
  Yuletide the winds drove neither snow nor carol-singers before them as they
  used. The sunshine and the winds only raised sad memories.</p>

  <p>Within the house the great hearths were half of them dark and cold; secret
  places were forgotten and unopened year by year; in the garrets treasures of
  the past mouldered into the rubbish of to-day; the garden wearied for a
  lover's tread&mdash;the great house was lonely.</p>

  <p>This however, was an inner and perceptive view of Ferriby. To the outer
  and casual gaze the Grange was in a state of fine repair and gave bounteous
  evidence of prosperity.</p>

  <p>What matter absence of neighbours? There were horses and traps in plenty
  in the stable to carry the owner whithersoever he willed. Petsham was a
  humming country town not half a dozen miles away with a railway
  station&mdash;the key to the world. The fishing hamlet of Droitlet was
  reached in a before-breakfast gallop, and in Droitlet the folk almost to a
  man were tenants of the Grange. And the owner of the Grange was the owner,
  too, of half the boats on Droitlet shore and of the wharf and the couple of
  coaling barges-from time immemorial the Ferribys had farmed the sea as well
  as the land, and when the sea withdrew they followed.</p>

  <p>Gentlefolk to begin with&mdash;what were the Ferribys now? Gentlefolk
  still they called themselves.</p>

  <p>Over the arched entrance where in Tudor days a drawbridge had hung were
  the remains still to be seen of the stone-cut quarterings of the ancient
  holders.</p>

  <p>Ancient the Ferribys were as was their dwelling, but as that had lost
  drawbridge and moat and outer wall and castellated battlements, and shrunk
  from castle to mansion, from mansion to farm, so had the family lost appanage
  and renown, and now in the countryside had fallen into that anomalous
  position that is neither fish, fowl nor good red-herring.</p>

  <p>At the Grange lived John Ferriby. He made as little pretence as his father
  before him to the circumstances and surroundings of a gentleman, though his
  grandmother was an Earl's daughter and his mother a Fairfax of the Fairfaxes
  from over the border, one of the proudest and poorest of old families.</p>

  <p>There was a bad strain in the race somewhere; it had showed in Cornelius
  Ferriby; it was rampant in his son&mdash;Devil Ferriby they called him.
  Education in the Petsham Grammar School had more than sufficed for him. He
  disdained an establishment; his father's house-keeper was his house-keeper,
  and she did what she pleased; and Jane Skidfell's pleasure was to save, and
  so long as she satisfied him&mdash;let her, said Ferriby.</p>

  <p>John Ferriby was not beloved&mdash;that did not trouble him. He rode and
  shot and handled a boat as well as a man can. He was tall and strong, and
  knew what the wenches thought of his dark face and his bold eyes and bold
  ways. He ran his farm as easily as he drove tandem. He could put his
  hand&mdash;and did&mdash;to anything he chose. He had a good balance at the
  bank, and a 'heart as rough as Esau's hand.'</p>

  <p>He was equipped to get through life well, and he thought so, and looked as
  if he did.</p>

  <p>Management takes the place of means. Where there are both working
  together, results are achieved as by enchantment. To the passers-by the work
  of Ferriby Grange seemed always done, never doing.</p>

  <p>Outside the house John Ferriby himself kept things up to their standard;
  inside, Jane Skidfell maintained an inviolable order, holding a rod of iron
  over half a dozen unpolished, hard-handed country maids.</p>

  <p>Look at the Grange this wild autumn evening. Rain and wind together had
  driven across its red-brick frontages in a grey whirl since dawn, and now, at
  sunset, the clouds broke in the west, showing red as if bloodstained fingers
  had dragged them apart, and the western casements were set glowing as if a
  lantern had been swung up behind them. The rain ceased while the wind
  freshened to half a gale. As usual about Ferriby Grange, whether wet or fine,
  there were few signs of actual activity. The great gates into the outer court
  stood wide open, proof the master was still abroad, but there was no evidence
  of anyone in waiting to take his horse; and in the wide yards beyond work
  seemed over&mdash;beasts foddered and stall-doors closed&mdash;with no one
  there to do it. Pass through that low, arched, nail-studded door between
  those two strips of railed-in garden, and you will find inside the same
  spell&mdash;results achieved in silence. The great house was in twilight;
  every door seemed closed, neither lights nor cheer, though even through the
  dusk the perfection of order was apparent. But suddenly, as the grey sky had
  been rent by the red sunset, so the stillness of Ferriby Grange was broken by
  the violent opening of a heavy door, and Jane Skidfell burst from the great
  kitchen in a blaze of wrath, driving before her a struggling and screaming
  girl.</p>

  <p>The girl is Irene Garth, cousin to John Ferriby, and cousin to Paul, also
  a Ferriby. He will be on the scene shortly, for Irene is seldom in a scrape
  without Paul appearing as a rescuer.</p>

  <p>Mistress Skidfell pushed the slim figure before her as easily as the wind
  skurried the leaves along the garden walks. She was a woman of
  terror-striking aspect, so uncompromising her glance and upright and
  commanding her form. Roused as she was now, her appearance was so relentless
  and grim that bolder stuff than Irene Garth might have felt uncomfortable in
  her shoes.</p>

  <p>Jane's obvious goal was the buttery. Its massive oak door loomed large and
  ominous at the other end of the long stone passage.</p>

  <p>'I won't! I won't!' screamed Irene; but Mrs. Skidfell held her like Fate
  with inflexible grip upon the shoulder, and, turning the key in the huge
  lock, with the other hand forced Irene down the flight of steps into the
  large but low and vaulted chamber, a buttery aforetime, and still retaining
  the name, but used now principally as a storeplace for the ale John Ferriby
  consumed as few people do water.</p>

  <p>The buttery had no windows. Light and air were supplied by slits in the
  massive outside wall, and now it was in utter dark save for the straight and
  ghostly glimmer of them.</p>

  <p>At the sight Irene's frenzies redoubled. She turned to wriggle past her
  captor, and escape up the steps to the passage behind them, that, though dark
  with shadow, appeared a place of light and joy itself compared to this black
  cell. Jane held her firm.</p>

  <p>'It's no use, Irene Garth. I've warned 'ee oft. Thee stays here, thou
  upstart minx. Slap me in t' face, wilt 'ee, thou charity-clad brat! I'll show
  thee thou must respect thy betters. Bide here a while, and cool thy tantrums
  off.'</p>

  <p>In Jane's speech, provincial and with a touch of dialect, there was still
  a deliberation that hinted she spoke as she chose, not as she must, and in
  her grim bearing and bitter use of words there was determination rather than
  passion. To anyone who knew Jane Skidfell even slightly, it was plain she was
  dealing with the girl to carry out a principle, not to satisfy dislike,
  though, indeed, little was the love lost between the pair of them. Feeling
  her way unerringly in the gloom, Jane steered her victim to where the rounded
  buttress of an arch projected seat-wise into the room.</p>

  <p>'You shan't put me here!' shrieked Irene, struggling like a cat. 'I'll
  tell Cousin Ferriby.'</p>

  <p>'Tell th' A'mighty thee'rt sorry for thy sins&mdash;that'll help thee
  sooner,' was the grim response. 'Cousin Ferriby himself don't say "shan't" to
  Jane Skidfell.' Then, spite of struggles, the strong arms planted the young
  figure firmly on the stone seat. 'When thou'rt come to thysen, thou canst say
  so,' she said, a little breathless, spite of her strength. With one hand she
  began deftly to loosen her long white apron.</p>

  <p>'What are you doing?' asked Irene fearfully, checking her sobs.</p>

  <p>'I am going to settle thee to cool,' said Jane.</p>

  <p>Of experience Irene guessed her intention. She was to be fastened to the
  iron ring in the pillar. She had noticed it with Paul when on a former
  occasion they had explored the buttery between them. Paul had said it was a
  ring prisoners were fastened to to be tortured.</p>

  <p>Sudden realization touched Irene into a paroxysm of shrieking fear.</p>

  <p>'You shan't, Jane Skidfell! You shan't! you shan't! I'll kill you!'</p>

  <p>And she bit and tore at Jane's hands and half-bared arms till Jane shook
  her, smarting from the pain; but she had her fast all the same, with the
  apron round her waist and fixed behind her to the ring, like a martyr in
  truth, if martyrs ever met their holy fate with such a scandalous display of
  earthly temper.</p>

  <p>Irene's sharp teeth broke the skin. 'Thou limb of evil, take that!' and
  Jane slapped her soundly. 'I've half a mind to set thee bare-ended on t'
  flags. A fine cure for temper!'</p>

  <p>She turned and made her way to the door. Irene could see her figure
  mounting the steps against the background of the darkening passage. Old
  Skidfell was really going, really going to leave her there!</p>

  <p>'Jane! Jane!' she cried, her tone changed to desperate entreaty. 'Dear
  Jane, don't leave me here! There are rats&mdash;you've said so yourself,
  Jane! Don't go! I shall die of fright. Dear Jane, I'll be good&mdash;I will,
  really!'</p>

  <p>Jane turned in the doorway.</p>

  <p>'Ah, you're no Ferriby, Irene Garth,' she said with ringing scorn. 'Ye'd
  bite and bless in a breath. There's no truth in you&mdash;but you're out of
  it with me.'</p>

  <p>'But the rats, Jane!' screamed the girl&mdash;'the rats! There's one
  there. Let me go, Jane, let me go!'</p>

  <p>'There are no rats in <i>my</i> buttery, and screamin' to me won't help
  ye,' was the grim answer. 'Cry to thy Maker to change t' heart in thee. Hark!
  t' A'mighty is riding the gale wi'out. Thou'rt a wicked lass&mdash;pray to
  Him to spare thee.'</p>

  <p>And Jane closed and locked the heavy door. There was a roar from the gale,
  a shriek from Irene. At the same moment she struggled free&mdash;the apron,
  indeed, being only very lightly fastened&mdash;and rushing wildly up the
  steps, battered with her fists upon the scarcely echoing oak panels.</p>

  <p>'Let me out! let me out! You're a beast! I hate you! I'll pull your hair
  out! I'll kill you! You're Satan's wife! God will strike <i>you</i>! Let me
  out! let me out!'</p>

  <p>It was no use, and Irene knew it. As well try to move the wind or the old
  walls as Jane Skidfell. She dropped in a heap on the steps, crying loudly. At
  last, exhausted, she lifted her head and, listening and peering, finally took
  courage, and rising to her feet, stood hesitating.</p>

  <p>Irene was a young lady of an unusually acute observation, and a memory
  retentive of detail. This sprang from an intensely curious, prying
  disposition. Curiosity, vanity, and greedy selfishness divided Irene Garth's
  nature pretty equally between them.</p>

  <p>The girl remembered that, on her former stolen visit to the buttery with
  Paul, she had noticed a shelf close to the steps on which stood candlestick
  and matches, placed there convenient to the hand of anyone descending into
  the buttery gloom.</p>

  <p>Irene put her hand out&mdash;she had remembered well. The matches were
  within her fingers' reach. She struck one joyfully. Ah, wouldn't old Skidfell
  like to see her now! And there was the candle. She lit it, and proceeded to
  take survey. What she principally revealed, however, was the one thing she
  could not see, and that was herself.</p>

  <p>Irene Garth was an amazingly pretty girl. Her features and colouring were
  perfect. She was endowed, too, with absolute superfluities of loveliness.
  Hair that curled distractingly of itself about her neck and forehead,
  dimples, a charming smile, and the power of grimacing and pouting and
  screaming and crying and showing off every species of sulks and temper
  without spoiling her fascinating appearance. Irene was over fourteen.
  Hopelessly spoilt by a feeble-minded mother, she was not ashamed to be
  childish still&mdash;'and it's a mercy,' said Jane Skidfell, and that was why
  she meted punishment as to a child, according to the primitive and deadly
  notions of her own rigid bringing-up.</p>

  <p>'Once let Irene Garth give up being the spoilt child she is, and she'll go
  to ruin swift,' said Jane Skidfell.</p>

  <p>Apart from her beauty, Irene had the charm that no man ever ignores. Her
  destiny was plain, and she was equipped for it.</p>

  <p>Holding the candle high above her head, Irene took a timorous survey. She
  saw on the shelf whence the candle had come a stone ink-bottle and pen and an
  account-book. This she would dearly have liked to overhaul&mdash;she was
  always wanting a chance to find out what money Cousin Ferriby had, and what
  he spent it on&mdash;but just then was not the moment. She saw flitches of
  bacon and bundles of herbs hanging from the arches. She scarcely knew them
  for what they were. They looked like the awful things in wizards' shops. The
  beer-barrels were more familiar&mdash;there seemed enough of them to
  provision a siege. Some big sacks stood up in a corner under one of the
  slits. Irene went towards them fearfully with beating heart; she had a very
  good memory for the gruesome, and, unable to retain even the leading dates of
  English history, recalled on the slightest provocation every item of the
  horrible she had ever read. Dead bodies were concealed in sacks, and she
  believed Jane Skidfell capable of murder&mdash;and Cousin Ferriby, too, for
  that matter. But the sacks contained flour, and flour, Irene remembered, is
  always associated in fairy-tales with goodness and the people who are 'put
  upon.'</p>

  <p>In her undisciplined young heart there was a leaning towards the dash and
  the masterfulness of what is known as evil; but unconsciously exemplifying
  how little our theories go with our practice, she was glad to find in the
  dark buttery something typical of 'good.' The candle-light, very welcome at
  first, now began to frighten her with its strange shadows. Holding it this
  way and that, trying to drive them away, she discovered another flight of
  stone steps, sunk in a recess and leading to a second door, but one so low
  and narrow it looked as if no man could enter it. She and Paul had overlooked
  this door and steps before, but they had explored in haste, and fearful of
  being discovered. Starting at every sound of the wind, her breath still
  coming in little sobs of rage and suspended terror, Irene went up the steps
  and tried the little door. She was half relieved to find it locked. A grating
  sound came from somewhere. She turned in alarm, and thought she saw a hideous
  black object run across the floor. With a piercing shriek she flung the
  candle at it, then cowered down in the dark, hiding her face and screaming
  loudly. The wind seemed to lull itself to listen, and presently a voice came
  faintly from without, the sound borne in through the slit: 'Hello! Hello
  there! Who's that?'</p>

  <p>Irene leapt to her feet with a rapturous cry. In a moment more she had
  scrambled up the sacks, and was shouting through the deep-set opening.</p>

  <p>'Paul! Paul! It's me! Where are you?'</p>

  <p>'I'm on the ledge,' came back the voice. 'I dropped my knife. I'm climbing
  over for it. Where on earth are <i>you</i>?'</p>

  <p>'In the buttery. I slapped old Skidfell's face, and she's locked me
  in.'</p>

  <p>The voice sounded nearer and stronger. The ledge apparently skirted the
  buttery walls.</p>

  <p>'What did you scream for? Frightened?'</p>

  <p>'Of course not, but I don't like rats. And&mdash;Paul&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Well?'</p>

  <p>Irene's voice took on a very sweet and coaxing tone.</p>

  <p>'You're going to make old Skidfell let me out, aren't you?' she said
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>'She won't&mdash;at my bidding. Isn't Cousin Ferriby back?'</p>

  <p>'No...Paul...'</p>

  <p>'Well?...'</p>

  <p>'You're not going, are you?'</p>

  <p>'I am, though,' came back the voice. 'Can't keep a footing in this wind.
  Skidfell 'll let you out all right, and if you're not frightened...'</p>

  <p>Irene broke into tears. 'But I <i>am</i> frightened. So would you be. It's
  pitch-dark, and there are rats swarming, scratching all over the place, and
  ghosts moving. Jane won't come near me. Paul, do...do let me out!
  I...dear...dear Paul!...'</p>

  <p>Her voice fell like music on the name.</p>

  <p>'All right,' came the boy's answer after a pause. 'Don't cry. Wait a bit.
  I'll see what I can do...Keep your pecker up.'</p>

  <p>Irene drew back and settled herself down upon the good-hearted sacks. She
  did not dare leave their wholesome contact to search for matches or candle,
  and she had implicit faith in her champion. But long before Paul could have
  had time to crawl along and off the ledge, as Irene even in the dark could
  calculate, the little door at the head of the narrow steps close by was
  opened noisily, and getting through it somehow, slamming it behind him, down
  came&mdash;Cousin Ferriby.</p>

  <p>Irene knew him as instantly as instinctively, the same instinct that,
  stronger than fear, kept her motionless in her place.</p>

  <p>Ferriby crossed the buttery like someone who knows his way in the dark. He
  paused on the other steps, however, and Irene heard him fumbling for the
  candle.</p>

  <p>'Confound the woman!' he muttered. 'Can't she leave the things where I put
  them?'</p>

  <p>He took matches from his own pocket, and, lighting one, held it above his
  head. The flare showed him Irene, who slipped from her meal-bags and came
  forward meekly.</p>

  <p>'Please, Cousin Ferriby, it's me.'</p>

  <p>'You!' He started, and, staring at the girl's lovely face, let the match
  burn his fingers, and dropped it with an oath. 'What the devil are you doing
  here?'</p>

  <p>'Mrs. Skidfell locked me in; and, oh. Cousin Ferriby, she called me awful
  names, and shook me and boxed my ears!'</p>

  <p>'You jolly well deserved it, I've no doubt,' was the rough answer.
  'Where's the candle?'</p>

  <p>'It's over there on the ground somewhere. A rat jumped up and knocked it
  out of my hand, or else it was a ghost. You'll take me with you when you go,
  won't you. Cousin Ferriby?'</p>

  <p>The hint of the imperial power of sex and beauty, combined with the
  coaxing of a dubious child, were curiously blended in Irene's musical young
  voice, and Ferriby seemed to recognize it. He laughed, and, lighting another
  match, found the candle, adjusted, and lit it.</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' he said, taking another good look at her. 'It might tame
  you a bit to leave you shut up here all night. I've half a mind to try it.
  Why can't you behave yourself, and do what you're told without so much
  fire-spitting? Bring me that jug.'</p>

  <p>Irene looked round, saw the blue pitcher, and brought it obediently, but
  stared with widening eyes to see Cousin Ferriby turn on ale by a tap as if it
  were water, fill the blue jug to foaming-point, and, tilting back his head,
  empty it at a draught.</p>

  <p>She gave a fastidious simper. 'Oh, Cousin John, how can you drink out of
  the jug&mdash;just like some labouring man! It's horrid!'</p>

  <p>Ferriby's reply was checked. There was a noise in the stone passage, acrid
  and violent. He put down the jug to listen. Irene, with an anxious eye on
  him, sidled a little nearer. It was Paul coming to the rescue.</p>

  <p>Jane Skidfell's voice rang out clearly in terrible tones, only hampered by
  want of breath: 'Thou'lt touch that door at thy peril, ma lad.'</p>

  <p>Paul's young voice rose in answer. 'Give me the key; if you don't I'll
  smash it in. If you weren't an old woman, I'd smash you.' A tremendous bang
  on the old oak panels followed this. 'It's all right, Irene,' the boy called.
  (Bang!) 'I'm coming.' (Bang!)</p>

  <p>'Let go of my hair, Jane Skidfell! Let go, I say, or I'll kick!'</p>

  <p>Irene cowered closely to John Ferriby's side, terrified. The young man
  looked down on her with a rough laugh.</p>

  <p>'You're a beauty, aren't you? Beginning bright and early with your
  sweethearts and your rescuers!' Then, as if the continued scuffling outside
  suddenly fired him, Ferriby snatched up his riding-whip and sprang up the
  steps.</p>

  <p>'Open the door, Jane!' he shouted. An instant silence followed the sound.
  Slowly the key turned gratingly, and the massive door swung back slowly,
  revealing Jane's gaunt, panting figure, and beside it a tall boy of a noble
  and most handsome bearing. His face was flushed, his clothes in disorder, but
  his eyes flashed defiance, and he stood with clenched fists and heaving
  breast, not bating an inch of what he had undertaken.</p>

  <p>'So it's you, master,' said Jane. 'And time, too. This is a pair of young
  devils&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'That'll do,' interrupted Ferriby. 'You needn't tell it to me.' He mounted
  a step higher, and took the boy by the shoulder. 'Devils, eh? Well, Devil
  Ferriby can look after his own, then. That'll do, Jane,' he added. 'I'll
  manage them now. Leave the key in the lock.'</p>

  <p>While he spoke he tightened his grip on Paul's shoulders and began to half
  push, half drag him down the steps into the buttery. Irene, thinking her
  cause won, began to dance up and down behind the screen of Ferriby's broad
  form, and wreathed her pretty face into exulting grimaces.</p>

  <p>'Aye, mop and mow!' exclaimed Jane, turning to her. 'He says true. The
  Ferribys are devils' brood, and ye'll know it. Ill-luck to the faithful that
  serve them.'</p>

  <p>And with almost a majestic gesture the old woman turned and disappeared
  down the stone passage.</p>

  <p>John and Paul had regained the level of the buttery floor. The boy tried
  to shake himself free.</p>

  <p>'You needn't hold me, Cousin John,' he said, his voice so clear there was
  in it something like the silvery tone of song. 'I'm not going to run
  away&mdash;I've done no harm. I was on the ledge, and I dropped my knife, and
  I was trying to climb down when I heard Irene scream...'</p>

  <p>'That was when the rat jumped,' struck in Irene hastily. 'I only just
  called out.'</p>

  <p>Ferriby's hand dropped from the boy's collar, and he looked from one to
  the other.</p>

  <p>'You screamed at the top of your voice,' said Paul, 'and...' he turned his
  eyes boldly on Ferriby's face, 'she said she was frightened, and cried and
  begged me to let her out. And when a girl does that, what are you to do.
  Cousin Ferriby? I asked old Skinflint&mdash;Jane, I mean&mdash;for the key
  quite civilly, I'm sure I did, and she tried to smack my face, and called me
  a beggar's brat&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'She called me that, too,' remarked Irene, sticking up her chin.</p>

  <p>'She's always calling us names. Cousin John, and when your back's turned
  she makes Irene do things that only servants do.'</p>

  <p>Ferriby laughed. 'Well, and why not, my young cock-of-the-walk?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, but it's washing up and sweeping and scrubbing. Cousin John!' cried
  Irene.</p>

  <p>'Well, and I say why not?' repeated Ferriby.</p>

  <p>'Oh, you're joking, Cousin John!' said the boy.</p>

  <p>'This is Ferriby Grange, and we are Ferribys.'</p>

  <p>'Oh no!' cried Ferriby. 'That string needs letting down a peg or two.
  Listen to me, the pair of you.' He looked round a moment, then seated himself
  upon the stone where Jane had previously deposited Irene. He motioned the boy
  to stand in front of him. At the same moment the white apron caught his
  eye.</p>

  <p>'What's this?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Old Skinflint's apron,' answered Irene. It seemed as if Cousin Ferriby
  were not going to be so very nice after all, and her voice dropped into a
  whimper. 'She tied me up with it while she locked me in&mdash;her nasty old
  smelling kitchen apron. Ugh! No servant was ever allowed to touch me at home.
  I wish I was at home.' Irene began to cry. 'I wish mamma hadn't died,' she
  sobbed.</p>

  <p>'Stop that blubbering, now, Irene,' cried Devil Ferriby.</p>

  <p>There was a pause. Irene drew out a handkerchief and dabbed her eyes,
  while Paul looked at the wall before him steadily, with set lips and
  indignant mien. Cousin John spoke to them almost as roughly as did Jane.
  Meanwhile, Cousin John heeded neither of them, but sat, one hand resting on
  his knee, the other switching his riding-whip lightly up and down the flags
  while he mused, his eyes bent upon the ground.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he looked up and bent his dark gaze keenly first on Paul's
  handsome bearing, then on the girl's downbent, charming head and half-hidden,
  wonderful little face.</p>

  <p>'How long have you been here?' he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>'Three months. Cousin Ferriby,' answered Paul.</p>

  <p>'And you're&mdash;let me see&mdash;fifteen, aren't you, and the lass here
  a year younger?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, Cousin Ferriby.'</p>

  <p>Ferriby laughed, not pleasantly. 'Well, it's time we understood one
  another,' he said. 'I've been busy and a good deal away since you turned up
  here, but I'm not away from home as a rule, and when I <i>am</i> at home I'll
  have things as I please, and I'll have you do as I please, too.'</p>

  <p>'Oh,' struck in Paul eagerly, 'whatever <i>you</i> please, of course,
  Cousin John, but that old woman&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'She frightens me awfully, sometimes,' said Irene, looking up from her
  handkerchief, 'and she says you're afraid of her, too.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps I am,' returned Ferriby grimly; 'at any rate, Jane Skidfell's
  word is law here, under mine, and when I'm not there to order you myself,
  you'll both do what she bids you.'</p>

  <p>The boy's eyes darkened. 'Why, Cousin John?' he asked, his chest
  heaving.</p>

  <p>'She wants to make a servant of me,' cried Irene-' of me. Cousin
  John!'</p>

  <p>John gazed in silence on her upthrown face. The cold light falling in
  through the wide-open door showed him its beauty; a queer look came over the
  young man's face. Paul didn't notice. He was eager to make much of almost the
  first chance given him of clearing things up with this relative, into whose
  household he had been thrown.</p>

  <p>'The other day,' he said stoutly, 'Jane Skidfell told me to go and help
  the man clean out the stables.'</p>

  <p>'And did you?' demanded Ferriby.</p>

  <p>The boy read the dark face in amazement. 'Why, Cousin John, of course
  not.'</p>

  <p>'Well, you'll go now,' was the answer.</p>

  <p>'What do you mean. Cousin Ferriby?'</p>

  <p>'You'll go now. Isn't that plain? You needn't be turning stables out this
  time of day; but Scarside isn't back from Petsham yet, and my horse is
  standing in the yard. Unsaddle him, and try your hand at bedding him down. It
  will be a good beginning.'</p>

  <p>'You're joking, Cousin Ferriby,' stammered the boy.</p>

  <p>'Am I? Don't lads of your size earn their living?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, but not like that. The Ferribys are gentlefolk.'</p>

  <p>'What's that to you?' demanded the other.</p>

  <p>Paul stood proudly. 'Everything. <i>I</i> am a Ferriby.'</p>

  <p>'With a difference, my fine cockerel&mdash;with a difference. And that
  difference has got to be understood if you want peace between us as well as
  cousinship.' And as John Ferriby spoke, he rose, with a laugh, and stood over
  the two, running his hand up and down his whip.</p>

  <p>'You're fifteen,' he said; 'I'm four-and-twenty. What d'ye suppose
  <i>I</i> want with a school-whelp and a baby ready-made '&mdash;and he took
  Irene's chin between his fingers. 'How long since your father died?' he asked
  of Paul.</p>

  <p>'Two years,' the boy answered, choking.</p>

  <p>'And I'm in black for mamma still,' put in Irene. 'She said you'd be so
  kind to me, Cousin John.'</p>

  <p>'Look here '&mdash;Ferriby bent over her savagely&mdash;' if you're going
  to whimper like a puppy, I'll tell Jane Skidfell to whip you like one.'</p>

  <p>'Cousin Ferriby!' cried the boy indignantly.</p>

  <p>Ferriby swung round on him. 'And you as well, for barking. Listen to me,
  <i>Cousin</i> Paul, and I'll tell you exactly how far our cousinship is going
  to help you. The Ferribys are not long-lived, and don't marry into long-lived
  families, it seems. We haven't got a relation above ground between us. But my
  father left me Ferriby Grange and a little to keep it going with. <i>Your</i>
  father&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Don't talk about him in that tone. Cousin Ferriby,' broke in the boy with
  quivering lips. 'He&mdash;I&mdash;you didn't know him. He's&mdash;he&mdash;'
  For the choking lump in his throat he could say no more.</p>

  <p>Irene looked from one to the other, the lovelier for her parted lips and
  anxious eyes. She was pretty sure she herself would come out all right, but
  she didn't know about Paul. He ought not to stand up to Cousin John like
  that, and yet there was a certain instinct in her that liked to see this
  man-and-boy dispute.</p>

  <p>Ferriby swung up the blue jug and strode across the buttery to the
  ale-barrel.</p>

  <p>'<i>Your</i> father died, my young buck,' he said, 'and left you nothing.
  And my father told me that he would. "You've got an uncle somewhere, my lad,"
  he said on his deathbed, "my only brother. And I had a sister, too," he
  said&mdash;"fair Lavinia."'</p>

  <p>'That was mamma,' struck in Irene eagerly.</p>

  <p>'That was mamma,' mimicked her cousin. He took a deep quaff from the jug
  he had refilled. 'And she ran away from Ferriby Grange when she wasn't much
  older than you,' he resumed, looking at Irene with a rough laugh as he set
  the jug down; 'and she took up with a mummer, and she and Mr. Mummer spent
  every penny they ever made or came by. Why not? Wasn't there always Ferriby
  Grange, and a Ferriby in it to look after their leavings?'</p>

  <p>'Cousin John,' cried Paul, standing up to the other with hot indignation,
  'it's a shame to speak like that to a girl, and about her own mother.'</p>

  <p>'Hark at the whipper-snapper!' sneered Ferriby. He drank again, and then
  turned on the boy as if inspired by the draught with sudden fury, 'D'ye want
  your head cuffed?' he shouted. 'How dare <i>you</i> take me to task!'</p>

  <p>Irene shrank back trembling at the threatening tones, and made a
  danger-sign of wrinkling brows and restless fingers; but Paul took no heed of
  her, his head high, his eyes splendid.</p>

  <p>'If it's anything you say about them. Cousin John,' he cried, 'I always
  shall! My father and Irene's mother were Ferribys, both of them, and this was
  their home as much as it is yours.'</p>

  <p>'Now, that's just where you make the mistake,' said</p>

  <p>Ferriby, advancing to him. 'When my grandfather died, there was precious
  little left for anybody; but what there was was left between the old man's
  three children equally&mdash;between my father, your father, and her mother
  equally&mdash;' He paused, tightening his lips.</p>

  <p>'Well, Cousin Ferriby, and that was fair,' said the boy.</p>

  <p>'That's spoken like a fool,' was the rough answer. 'My father, with his
  portion, had this Grange thrown in, the house to keep up, the farm to
  restock, the land to redeem, timber to replace, and then he'd been working on
  it hard for years for nothing. His brother and sister had gone their own
  sweet way, but came back when the old man died. Oh yes, fast enough then. And
  my father put it to them: "This is an unfair will," he said; "you have no
  right to share alike with me. But let that pass, only I'm burdened with the
  Grange and the land; lend me some of your portion to keep it together." But
  not they. Not one penny would they let him have.'</p>

  <p>'No,' put in Irene, with interest suddenly revived in something that once
  had been a thrice-told tale; 'I've heard mamma talk of it. They'd expected a
  great deal more, she and Uncle Paul. The whole three portions together came
  to no more than what they had each expected. Mamma often said she wondered
  what Gran'papa Ferriby could have done with all his money.'</p>

  <p>'And at Petsham Station,' said Paul, eyeing the other with a high-spirited
  boy's proud disfavour, 'a porter told me you were the richest man of your age
  in the county.'</p>

  <p>John Ferriby laughed. He finished the ale in silence, wiped his moustache,
  and stood, legs slightly apart, holding his whip lightly before him, and
  looking evilly from one young thing to the other.</p>

  <p>'No,' he said presently, 'I'm not a rich man, even for my age, and I'm not
  fond of mummers' vixens or upstart collops. It was my father's whim that when
  your folks left you beggars, as he knew they would, that I should have you
  here; but if it had been left to me you should have rotted in the workhouse,
  both of you, before I would have stirred a finger.'</p>

  <p>'If that's what you think,' answered the boy, with heaving breast, his
  lips white, his eyes flashing, 'I'd rather be in the workhouse than stay
  here. Papa had friends. I'll go to them&mdash;I'll leave your house
  to-night.'</p>

  <p>Irene uttered a little cry, starting forward, and in Devil Ferriby's dark
  face the evil look deepened.</p>

  <p>'Not so fast,' he said; 'you'll stay where you are till you've paid for
  the two years' schooling you've just had&mdash;all the schooling you'll get,
  too.'</p>

  <p>'You're a cad, Cousin Ferriby!' burst from the boy's white lips. 'I'm only
  a boy; I have no money yet.'</p>

  <p>'No,' returned Ferriby, with a savage sneer, 'but you have hands and feet
  and head. Old Scarside can do with a boy like you to help. Be off now and see
  if he's home, and if not get my horse bedded down, as I told you just
  now.'</p>

  <p>Paul did not stir. Irene made a little terrified movement.</p>

  <p>'Well!' cried John Ferriby.</p>

  <p>'I'm not going. Cousin John,' said the boy. 'Not when you put it like
  that.'</p>

  <p>Devil Ferriby advanced. 'Think a bit, my lad. You're not going?' He raised
  his whip.</p>

  <p>'No!' The boy faced him undauntedly. 'I'd bed down my father's horse, but
  not yours. You're not a gentleman. You taunt us with having no money, you
  call girls names, and speak cruelly of my father, and I won't bed your horse
  down if you kill me for it.'</p>

  <p>'You d&mdash;d whelp!' said Ferriby. 'Take that!'</p>

  <p>The stroke fell clean across the boy's face, bringing blood freely. He
  stood unblenching, and tossed his head back with a laugh, so that the red
  drops flew.</p>

  <p>'Now will you go?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>Irene darted forward and caught the upraised arm, screaming.</p>

  <p>'Oh, Cousin Ferriby, don't!' she cried&mdash;' don't, don't! How can you?
  His face is bleeding!'</p>

  <p>Ferriby shook her off furiously. 'Get out of the way!' he shouted. He
  turned again to Paul: 'Well&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Paul looked at him steadily. 'You're a cad and a coward,' was his answer,
  'and I'll feed other people's pigs before I'll serve you ever&mdash;'</p>

  <p>As he spoke, his clear voice a ringing cry, there came a sudden vision to
  the buttery door, and John Ferriby stood arrested, his hand falling to his
  side.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-0-2"
     id="ch-0-2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">The apparition was a girl&mdash;a woman. Vision,
apparition, either word
  conveyed without extravagance the effect of Daphne Estorel as she stood in
  the grey light of the stone passage looking down on the grim little drama at
  the foot of the buttery steps.</p>

  <p>There seemed a grace and brightness about the whole figure savouring at
  that moment of the unearthly.</p>

  <p>A full and straight grey gown fell round Daphne's ankles, and across her
  shoulders lay a muslin kerchief; in the knot of it, upon her bosom, a bunch
  of autumn flowers. Her hair was like a saint's halo, of the purest and palest
  gold. Grave blue eyes looked from an oval face of the same strange purity of
  colour.</p>

  <p>Irene stared with all her eyes. Devil Ferriby's hand falling to his side,
  he stared too, then hailed the newcomer with his rough laugh&mdash;in it,
  perhaps, a note of apology for what he had been caught at.</p>

  <p>Paul alone kept his bleeding face turned stolidly away.</p>

  <p>'You, Daphne?' said Ferriby. 'When did <i>you</i> get back?'</p>

  <p>'Ten minutes since&mdash;just long enough to take off my things.' Daphne's
  voice was bright and pleasant-cordial even. She took no notice of Irene or of
  the boy. 'Aunt Skidfell sent me to show you that I'm here again, and to tell
  you tea is ready and the cakes spoiling.'</p>

  <p>'Why didn't Jane tell me she was expecting you?' growled Ferriby.&mdash;'
  You've grown into a fine young lady, I suppose.' He mounted the
  steps.&mdash;' Did Scarside bring you from Pet sham?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.' A laugh broke from the girl's lips. 'Scarside has not changed in
  these three years, Mr. John. He opened his lips twice in seven miles.'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' answered Ferriby, 'these Yorkshire moors don't breed
  chatterers.'</p>

  <p>Without a backward glance, Daphne moving away lightly before him, the
  young man, doubling the lash of his whip into his hand&mdash;it was
  sticky&mdash;followed into the passage, closing the door upon the boy and
  girl.</p>

  <p>Irene remained where she was, too absorbed in astonishment to make
  resistance. Paul, his back to the interruption, had not stirred, did not
  now.</p>

  <p>'Whoever can she be?' exclaimed Irene in an utter amazement. 'She called
  old Skinflint "aunt." I wonder if she's a servant? She said "Mr. John." She
  hadn't any cap or apron on. Her hair is golden. Did you like it, Paul? I
  wonder if I should look better with fair hair?' Irene took her red-brown
  curls between her fingers...' Paul, did you think she was pretty?'</p>

  <p>There was no answer. Irene crept up the steps, and, as she sniffed through
  the huge keyhole, there came a sense of warmth and fragrance down the
  passage.</p>

  <p>'Oven-bottoms and potato-cakes,' said Irene. 'Oh! I wonder if she'd give
  me some if I said I was sorry.' She cautiously tried the massive, circular
  handle. 'Paul!' she called in an excited whisper. 'Paul! The door isn't
  locked. Let's go, and I'll say I am sorry.'</p>

  <p>There was no answer. Irene, looking round, surveyed the still motionless
  figure of the boy a little dubiously. Descending the steps, she approached
  him with a touch of timidity; then, peeping round at his averted face, she
  started back with an exclamation of aversion and horror.</p>

  <p>'Oh, I say, your cheek <i>is</i> bleeding, Paul! Does it hurt?'</p>

  <p>Paul sharply turned his shoulder.</p>

  <p>'You needn't be so cross,' pouted the girl. 'It wasn't my fault. He'd have
  hit you a second time if it hadn't been for me.'</p>

  <p>'If it hadn't been for you he'd never have hit me at all!' cried Paul, his
  full heart breaking into speech.</p>

  <p>'You are always dragging me into your scrapes. And you'd nothing to do
  with his not hitting me a second time&mdash;it was that woman opening the
  door.'</p>

  <p>'It wasn't a woman!' cried Irene&mdash;'only a girl not much older than I
  am.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I don't care who it was!' The boy stamped savagely, fighting
  fiercely with the passion swelling in his throat. 'I wish I was dead! He
  struck me like a dog. I...I...I'd like to kill him!'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I don't mind Cousin John so much,' said Irene glibly. 'It's old
  Skinflint: I wish someone would kill <i>her</i>! Don't cry, Paul.'</p>

  <p>Paul shook her off. 'I'm not crying. Go away! I don't want you&mdash;you
  only get me into rows. Make up to Cousin John.'</p>

  <p>The girl came and laid an arm against his shoulder and her lovely face
  coaxingly against his sleeve.</p>

  <p>'Don't be cross, Paul&mdash;dear old Paul!' she murmured caressingly. 'I
  like you so awfully, Paul. If it weren't for you I'd run away.'</p>

  <p>'There's no "if" about my doing it,' said the boy. 'I'm going
  to-night.'</p>

  <p>Irene's eyes dilated. Her face went white. She clung to him in a terror
  most unmistakably real.</p>

  <p>'Oh no, Paul; you mustn't. I couldn't stay here without you. You knew
  mamma, you know, and she'd beg you not to leave me, I know. Promise me you
  won't go! Besides, you're so brave. Cousin John will never touch you again.
  Say you won't go. If you do I shall follow, and I shall die on the moor, and
  you'll be sorry then. You won't go, will you? Say you won't, for my
  sake&mdash;poor little Irene, who loves you so. Paul, say you won't run
  away.'</p>

  <p>She had forgotten the shudder his bleeding cheek inspired. She clung both
  arms about his neck. Her breath was as sweet as flowers. Her warm lips
  touched his throat in eager caresses. Paul did not move. He stood erect with
  down-thrust hands and fingers clenched, his head high; but when he spoke the
  first bitterness of tone was mollified.</p>

  <p>'Well, I don't believe you <i>do</i> care,' he said; 'but I'll see.'</p>

  <p>Irene looked up into his face. 'You won't go? Promise me, Paul.'</p>

  <p>Again she kissed him. The boy stirred suddenly beneath her lips. 'Dear
  Paul, you couldn't leave Irene, could you?'</p>

  <p>'All right,' he said, putting her away from him, 'you needn't bother. I
  shan't go to-night, at any rate.'</p>

  <p>'You must never go.' Irene spoke with satisfaction&mdash;the tone of one
  who has gained her point and fancies she always can. 'When we're grown up
  quite I'll marry you. Then we'll go away together, and we'll make Cousin John
  give us some money, and we'll travel...Oh, your poor, poor cheek! He
  <i>has</i> cut it. Sit down and let me wipe it with my handkerchief.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Paul, rousing himself to a sudden practical decision, 'don't
  wipe it...Is it bleeding much?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Awfully!'</p>

  <p>Paul dabbed at the cut an instant with his hand, then looked round as if
  in search of something. On the shelf inside the door, at the head of the
  steps from which Ferriby had brought the candle, stood an old-fashioned
  schoolroom inkstand, a pen upright in one of the holes, and beside it the
  account-book Irene had noticed in which Jane set down her firkins of butter
  and her gallons of milk.</p>

  <p>The boy's eyes lit on these items with satisfaction. He resumed his
  dictatorship. 'Get me down that book and the pen, Irene!' he
  commanded.&mdash;' I don't want the ink.'</p>

  <p>Irene went and came obediently. 'What are you going to do?' she asked
  curiously.</p>

  <p>'Write a vow of vengeance in my blood,' said Paul. 'I saw a fellow do it
  once at school.' He tore a leaf as he spoke from the account-book.&mdash;'
  There, put that back, Irene.'</p>

  <p>Irene hastened to obey and to return to watch with eager eyes. Paul spread
  the piece of paper on the buttery shelf and tried to fill the pen with
  blood.</p>

  <p>'Bring the candle, Irene,' he commanded. 'The wretched stuff's got
  thick.'</p>

  <p>Irene brought it. 'Oh, I say, Paul,' she giggled, 'isn't it wicked?'</p>

  <p>'I don't care. I'd rather be wicked than a coward.' He tried the pen
  again. 'No, it's got too thick.' He set the pen down and gingerly pulled the
  weal open so that fresh blood flowed.</p>

  <p>Irene stepped back with a fastidious shudder. 'Oh, how can you!' she said
  with disgust; but Paul thought it was sympathy.</p>

  <p>'<i>That</i> doesn't hurt,' he said proudly. 'It was <i>his</i> doing it.
  Now, here we are.' He filled the pen with some trouble and began to write,
  stopping almost after every letter to laboriously refill. Irene tiptoed to
  see over his shoulder and read the words aloud as they shaped themselves
  under Paul's fingers.</p>

  <p>'<i>I, Paul Ferriby, do hereby vow</i>&mdash;' ('That's how the other
  fellow began,' interpolated Paul) '<i>the most deadly
  vengeance</i>&mdash;You've not spelt "vengeance" right,' she broke off.</p>

  <p>'Oh, bother! it's spelt in blood. That's near enough.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Vengeance</i>,' read Irene, '<i>on my cousin Devil Ferriby</i>. Oh,
  Paul,' she said, 'dare you write "devil" in blood? Something might happen,
  mightn't it?'</p>

  <p>'It wouldn't matter if it <i>did</i>&mdash;to him,' answered Paul. 'The
  fellow whose blood it is stands all right, you know,' he added with the
  confidence of one well versed.</p>

  <p>'Oh!' Irene's tone was dubious. She tiptoed again while Paul laboured on.
  'Ah!' she cried, shuddering away again, this time with horror, 'the blood's
  dropping on your collar.'</p>

  <p>'Let it!' said Paul. He held the paper up and read from it with
  appreciation: '<i>He is a cad and a brute. One day I shall strike him back,
  and I hope that I shall kill him. Written with my blood (he did it)
  this</i>&mdash;What's the date?' he asked, as he bent again over the
  document.</p>

  <p>'September 14, 18&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'All right. I know the year. There,' he concluded triumphantly, looking up
  from the finished work. 'I'd put in something about you only there's no more
  blood. Golly, it does soon get thick.'</p>

  <p>'Something about me,' cried Irene, startled. 'What?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, that it's because of you, to stick up for you, and all that sort of
  thing.'</p>

  <p>'How mean!' said the girl, with her delicious pout. 'To put it off on me!
  You want vengeance on Cousin Ferriby because he struck you.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' answered Paul; 'but you were at the bottom of it.'</p>

  <p>At that moment the vision&mdash;girl, woman, divine,
  human&mdash;reappeared. The great door was opened, and Daphne Estorel stood a
  moment, vision-wise, upon the high threshold. 'You were at the bottom of it,'
  Paul had said. The new-comer must have overheard; almost as if for one second
  she saw into the future, her hand went to her heart. She came down. Her
  footfall was lighter than Irene's. In the candlelight her hair seemed to
  shoot out sparks and spokes of gold. She looked smilingly from one to the
  other, pausing at the foot of the steps.</p>

  <p>Paul, startled, handed his paper hastily to Irene, who concealed it in her
  pocket, and began to wipe the pen upon his jacket-sleeve.</p>

  <p>'Won't you come and have some tea?' said Daphne in her bright voice; and
  her clear, direct gaze saw nothing but what she bent it on. 'It's rather cold
  here, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>Paul turned his face away; Irene stared silently.</p>

  <p>'We don't know who you are,' she said, speaking as she had been taught to
  speak to her inferiors, a rising inflexion on the last word, her head held
  up, her well-bred voice pitched clear and high.</p>

  <p>'I am Daphne Estorel,' was the answer; and though the speaker glanced at
  her, Irene was conscious of being overlooked. 'I am Mrs. Skidfell's niece,
  and I live sometimes here and sometimes with another relative in Devonshire.
  I have been away for three years, and as this is my first evening home, I'm
  having a grand tea. Won't you come?'</p>

  <p>Irene looked at Paul. 'Come along, Paul. Shall we?' She ignored Daphne as
  she spoke, turning her shoulder.</p>

  <p>'You go if you want to.' Paul did not show his face. 'I'm not hungry.'</p>

  <p>And now Irene took a deliberate survey of the newcomer from head to heel.
  Old Skinflint's niece&mdash;a common person. She tossed her head.</p>

  <p>'I think it's silly to stay here if one needn't,' she said. 'I shan't.'
  And she hurried to the door, but there a thought checked her, and she glanced
  imperiously at Daphne.</p>

  <p>'Does old Sk&mdash;I mean, does Jane know?'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes, Aunt Jane knows. She sent me.'</p>

  <p>'Well, and I don't care if she didn't. Cousin Ferriby's there; she can't
  touch me. Come, Paul. Don't be silly. Come along.'</p>

  <p>But the boy made a sullen gesture that he wanted to be left alone. The
  maddening smell of the frizzling ham touched Irene's delicately eager little
  nose&mdash;and Cousin Ferriby was there!</p>

  <p>'Oh, you are a goose!' she cried, and with a laugh she ran lightly
  away.</p>

  <p>There was a moment's pause. Paul was conscious that this new girl still
  lingered.</p>

  <p>'Don't wait,' he said over his shoulder. 'I'd rather you didn't. I don't
  want any tea. I don't want to ever eat anything in this house again.'</p>

  <p>'Your little cousin doesn't seem to mind,' said Daphne gently.</p>

  <p>'Irene's a girl!' was the swift answer. 'And&mdash;and-he can't strike
  her.'</p>

  <p>And then, because his heart was fuller than he could bear, and because
  Irene's desertion had stung him-she was always like that, edging a fellow on
  and then going dancing off&mdash;he suddenly turned sharply and completely
  away, and flinging his arms up against the buttery wall, laid his head down
  on them, and fought with the beastly lump in his throat that choked him.
  Daphne picked up the apron, then the pen that had fallen to the ground, set
  this back in the inkstand, rearranged book and candle, and made a fuss with
  the pans.</p>

  <p>At last Paul turned round.</p>

  <p>'I say,' he began&mdash;and there was a distinct note of gratitude in the
  young voice&mdash;' look here, you won't tell that I...I...but it's been so
  jolly lonely since my father died...and...and...it's so beastly, you know,
  when a fellow has no money...and...and my head's thumping.'</p>

  <p>Daphne came up and put a hand upon his shoulder. She looked into his face,
  his handsome, strong, clear, and noble young face&mdash;from hair to chin ran
  the red brand Devil Ferriby had set there.</p>

  <p>'That wicked cut is getting stiff and hurting, isn't it?' she said.</p>

  <p>Paul did not try to throw her off. 'Yes, a bit,' he said in half apology.
  'He did do it. I say, you saw him, didn't you?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. What's your name?' asked Daphne Estorel.</p>

  <p>'Paul Ferriby.'</p>

  <p>'You're a splendid fellow,' she said.</p>

  <p>Paul did not think she chaffed him. He looked into her face, and somehow
  his spirit was caught back to the summers at home&mdash;the 'days that were
  no more.'</p>

  <p>He dashed the back of his hand to his eyes.</p>

  <p>'I say,' he stammered...' I&mdash;I don't know what's wrong with me, but
  I'm so beastly wretched here, you know&mdash;and my father...we were such
  chums...I...'</p>

  <p>Daphne stood silent, enfolding him with her presence.</p>

  <p>Then, glancing up, she saw that Irene had stolen noiselessly back to the
  buttery door. The eyes of the two maidens met, and held each other a long
  second, the wordless beginning of battle.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-1"
     id="ch-1"></a>PART I.&mdash; THE PLAY BEGINS</h2>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-1"
     id="ch-1-1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">The living-room at Ferriby was low and raftered, and had
kept its
  old-fashioned furniture.</p>

  <p>A living-room close to the kitchen, common to the use of any member of the
  family, it had for all that and furniture a hundred years old, gradually come
  to be looked upon as Irene Garth's apartment in particular.</p>

  <p>When she returned from her school-days in London she had chosen to like
  it, and that was enough.</p>

  <p>She liked it, she said, because she had society in it, and under that Miss
  Garth disguised several recommendations to its use too paltry to be
  recognized by any mind not akin to her own.</p>

  <p>The window of the room, a casemented lattice, occupying the whole length
  of the outer wall, had a deep sill, and under the sill was a dais raised by a
  foot or so from the floor.</p>

  <p>Here on this dais were a lounge and work-table and a basket chair,
  incongruous against the panelling, and showing signs of rougher wear than
  Irene's use could have given.</p>

  <p>Devil Ferriby sat there.</p>

  <p>Kneeling on the broad, low window-sill of the open casements, Irene could
  look over a small flower-garden. It was shut in by a hand-depth of brickwork,
  showing, above a hedge of yew, the angle of one of the red walls of the outer
  court; but turn to the left and there was a path leading from a side door to
  the side road that took away to Droitlet and the shore. Turn your gaze below,
  there was a narrow box-edged walk that, skirting window and kitchen wall, led
  through the yards into the grazing meadow and the home fields.</p>

  <p>Upstairs in the great room where Irene slept, Daphne Estorel's twin to it
  across a landing, the sea was in the view and the changing lights of far
  stretches; but Irene preferred to see who passed from the yards, or who by
  chance came to the side door.</p>

  <p>Cousin Ferriby did for one, cantering past into the stables with a
  flashing look at the casement, then returning to stride in on her through the
  narrow entry, gaitered, whip in hand, splashed often from head to foot.</p>

  <p>But Irene liked this. She liked Devil Ferriby's bold ways. It was
  delightful to coquet with him to the very edge of his brutalities and his
  fierce strength, and see him pull himself up, and steady his passions to the
  leash, <i>barely</i> to the leash.</p>

  <p>The vicinity of the kitchen Irene could have done without, but Jane
  Skidfell was little in those vast quarters now. Since Daphne Estorel had
  returned to the Grange to spend there the greater part of her time, Jane had
  assumed an added state. She made no pretence of altering her tongue or her
  ways, but she dressed in black without shawl or apron; a piece of fine lace
  was turned over the neck-band and fastened with a massive mourning brooch of
  gold, its rim touch ing her withered throat. Her cap was of lace, and over
  her spare shoulders on Sundays and high occasions a gold chain rested.</p>

  <p>'I am t' housekeeper,' she would say, 'and no servant. And when Daphne
  Estorel is in t' hoose thee'll remember, Irene Garth, she stands here as well
  as thee dost&mdash;ay, an' better.'</p>

  <p>Irene treated Jane to a curled lip and silence to her face, or outspoken
  disdain and slight behind her back.</p>

  <p>Cousin John gave her her own way, and he was the master. In the corner of
  the living-room where she chose to spend her time stood a bureau black with
  age, its dropping handles of brass shaped like fuchsias. Here Devil Ferriby,
  opening the flap from a great bunch of keys that never left his person, would
  sit to his accounts, and Irene loved then to use her power and distract
  him.</p>

  <p>In the wall near which the bureau stood were two latched doors, one into
  the entry ending in the side door and the garden, the other opening steeply
  on a flight of stairs up which Irene could fly light-footed to the floors
  above, or steal down from her room and out into the garden and no one the
  wiser&mdash;should she wish it. For these reasons Irene found the
  old-fashioned, low-ceilinged living-room desirous. The meals that it had been
  wont to serve there were laid instead in what had been the&mdash;'still-room'
  of the Grange in days gone by. This was a large and pleasant apartment, very
  sunny, opening through wide glass doors upon all that was left of a once fair
  pleasaunce. The lavender bushes from which ancient dames of Ferriby had
  distilled waters, still grew there, grey and gnarled, and beds of herbs were
  there and a broken wall by a half-buried sundial where peacocks had strutted.
  The place spoke of old grandeur, and, for all the sunshine that it stored,
  was perhaps too sad.</p>

  <p>In this room Daphne Estorel spent a good many hours, and it pleased Irene
  that she should be the one whom the maid-servant must disturb when meal-times
  came.</p>

  <p>There was a dining-hall, grand and galleried, in the great house; but John
  Ferriby would have no style, no attempt at it.</p>

  <p>Jane Skidfell still saved as she pleased, but Ferriby spent, grudgingly,
  though freely, upon Irene. On matters outside his own interest he spent not a
  farthing; only where money was an investment he used it well, and the estate
  of the Grange flourished.</p>

  <p>It was a swooning day in July. The casements of Irene's room were all wide
  open upon a glitter of sunshine and geraniums.</p>

  <p>Over Ferriby and its gardens and great yards hung the drowse of a summer
  afternoon, of the in-between hours, when everybody is about his business, and
  doors stand open upon empty spaces, and sunlight scarcely moving across
  tidied floors. Irene seemed the only one alive in the lower rooms, but in her
  apartment there was considerable animation. Three burly men had just
  deposited upon the dais a dwarf piano in ebony and gold, and now stood
  mopping their brows and surveying their handiwork with a too obvious air of
  seemingly thinking of nothing else.</p>

  <p>Irene, in a blue muslin gown, a bright note of colour against the red Hue
  of the geraniums, surveyed the operations with triumphant satisfaction. This
  was Cousin Ferriby's last concession.</p>

  <p>'I am afraid it was very heavy,' she said, glancing from the piano to the
  men.</p>

  <p>Her smile was indescribably and indiscriminately charming. The foreman
  touched his forehead.</p>

  <p>'More awk'ard than heavy, miss. 'Tis the way with these little lady
  piannys&mdash;bound to be awk'ard, though not, as you may say, heavy.'</p>

  <p>'Lady piano!' Irene laughed.</p>

  <p>'An' me an' my mates have taken care this little lady shouldna' think as
  'twasn't gentlemen a-handlin' of her,' went on the man, with a covered wink
  at the others.</p>

  <p>His tone was respectful enough, but when Irene Garth talked to a man she
  lowered barriers. She laughed again at the foreman's wit, threw up the lid,
  and ran her white, ringed fingers lightly over the keys.</p>

  <p>'Perfect,' she said.</p>

  <p>'Like the weather, miss,' spoke up a second fellow with an open
  grin&mdash;' leastways, when you're not drivin' pianny carts in the sun.'</p>

  <p>Irene dropped her hands and looked at the men with pretty puzzled brows.
  They looked back at her admiringly.</p>

  <p>'Of course,' she said, smiling; 'that is just what you have been
  doing&mdash;driving six miles in the blazing sun! I am so sorry Mr. Ferriby
  is not here...<i>Would</i> you like some tea?'</p>

  <p>Coquetry was as natural to Irene as the breath she drew&mdash;she would
  flirt with a plough-boy. It was life to her to watch her beauty and her charm
  strike fire in everyone&mdash;to watch for that moment when something leapt
  into the eyes of every man who gazed on her, and then spring away from the
  encounter and hope in her heart that still another would carry a mark of her
  branding.</p>

  <p>The foreman laughed and glanced at his companions.</p>

  <p>'Well, thank you kindly, miss, a glass of beer...'</p>

  <p>'Of course&mdash;how stupid of me! Only how you men can prefer it to
  tea&mdash;' She moved towards the door into the kitchen, and, half-way,
  looked back over her shoulder as if she was charming Devil Ferriby himself,
  not three aproned workmen. 'Beer for all of you?' she smiled.</p>

  <p>The men grinned in chorus.</p>

  <p>'Well,' said one spokesman, 'since you're so passin' kind, miss, if so be
  there's a drop o' whisky handy&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Whisky!' Irene opened her lovely eyes. 'The stuff you take with
  soda-water?'</p>

  <p>'No soda-water, thank you, miss&mdash;nothin' so heady.'</p>

  <p>Irene nodded, and opened the door commanding the kitchen. 'Sophy!' she
  called. The men coming off the dais nudged each other and grinned, twirling
  their caps. 'Sophy!' called Irene impatiently. The bright silence answered,
  then in a moment a light footfall brought&mdash;Daphne Estorel.</p>

  <p>In an instant the grin left the men's faces; they straightened themselves,
  and stood a little shamefaced.</p>

  <p>It was Daphne Estorel again appearing vision-wise. About Daphne at
  two-and-twenty were still to the full the grace and brightness that had made
  her to Irene, years ago that memorable day in the buttery, appear as
  something and someone of another world. The gold of Daphne's hair was as pure
  and pale now as then, the face unchanged, lily-pale, with grave, rose-pink
  lips, and the grave blue eyes looked into Irene's with the same steady
  candour and the same challenge. Yet Irene Garth's beauty left Daphne
  Estorel's unseen&mdash;not her influence unfelt, but her beauty unseen. In
  that Irene was pre-eminent. She drew back frigidly.</p>

  <p>'I was calling for Sophy,' she said in her well-bred accents.</p>

  <p>'Sophy has taken the place of someone at the milking to-day,' said Daphne.
  'There is no one here. Did you want anything?' She glanced at the three
  men.</p>

  <p>'I did, but it's out of the question to trouble you,' answered Irene
  unpleasantly. 'I wanted some refreshment for these men. They've brought my
  piano all the way from Petsham in this heat.'</p>

  <p>'A glass of ale, miss,' struck in the foreman in an altered tone, directed
  to Daphne, 'if it's handy, miss. The young lady needn't trouble.'</p>

  <p>'It is so vexatious that Cousin John should be away...'</p>

  <p>'He is seldom here in the daytime,' said Daphne; 'it need make no
  difference. Scarside is outside. He will give them anything they want. Will
  you come this way, please?'</p>

  <p>The men followed a trifle sheepishly, taking no further notice of the
  young lady in blue, deferring to Daphne Estorel as everyone did defer, even
  Devil Ferriby. But Irene snapped her fingers at it. She made no bid for
  respect and obeisances. Let Daphne Estorel tread her saintly heights and wear
  her golden halo! Irene preferred to come into a personal contact with her
  fellows, to see and feel her power. Devil Ferriby would not swear in Daphne's
  presence: he did in Irene's. Irene cared nothing for the distinction. It was
  she who could flush Cousin John's cheek. It was when her beauty and her wiles
  urged him too far that he strangled the fierce oaths on his lips as he turned
  savagely on his heel. This was the tribute Irene Garth found savour in.</p>

  <p>She had grown into great beauty. Everything about her was lavish, warm,
  voluptuous. Figures of speech for her were truths. Her red-brown hair was a
  wealth, her skin like milk and roses, her eyes 'violets steeped in dew,' her
  shoulders and arms curved in the lines 'no painter ever drew,' and the soft
  whiteness of her throat alone was temptation.</p>

  <p>She had retained her girlish capacity of making grimaces and not spoiling
  her perfect features. As Daphne disappeared with the men she indulged in one,
  well aimed if unseen, and returned to the piano. A piano! In Ferriby
  Grange...bought and paid for by Devil Ferriby for his cousin, Irene
  Garth!...Jane Skidfell knew of it in silence. 'He'll not marry the wench,'
  she said to herself in those long hours when she sat pondering, unseeingly,
  through the horn glasses on her nose, upon the Bible open on her
  knee&mdash;'he'll not marry her. 'Tis nought of her destiny nor his. Leave
  'em alone.'</p>

  <p>Irene could play well. In her education she had pleased herself, carrying
  her way with Cousin John as she did in everything. She could play and sing;
  she could touch the guitar and dance; she could swim and ride; she could
  smoke a cigarette with Spanish grace; and wear a costume and recite
  tragically or comically, and both well.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Mummer,' as John contemptuously called him, had been her father, and
  Irene had a good deal of his art.</p>

  <p>But she had no thought of the stage. Her dreams, hazy still of some golden
  wordless future, included nothing of effort on her own part beyond the
  subjugation of men.</p>

  <p>She sat down to her piano and began to play. Made for caresses, everything
  about Irene was soft with warmth and languor in it. In that dark-set room, in
  her blue gown against the red geraniums, playing softly, smiling as she
  played, she was excuse enough, even silent, for any man's infatuation;
  speaking, moving, wooing, she had a dozen added charms. A woman planned
  indeed.</p>

  <p>She played a waltz, 'The Thousand and One Nights,' with its wild, wicked
  tune. A young man coming along the box-edged path beneath the window paused
  startled, and then sank against the wall beside the open casement, and his
  sun-reddened, work-hardened hands fell clenched to his sides. Irene saw him
  instantly, but she went on playing.</p>

  <p>It would seem at sight it was one of the farm labourers whom the
  cymbal-like measure had arrested. His dress was rough and his coat hung over
  his arm; his shirt of coarse blue calico had neither cuffs nor collar. He
  could not help it, for he had given no thought to the fact that the blue
  suited his tanned throat and face and his dark hair that tumbled over his
  forehead from under a straw hat thrust back picturesquely, as any labourer
  can be picturesque. Tall and finely made, the young man's figure slouched,
  and the hands were coarsened and broadened. Handsome beyond a doubt, over the
  whole appearance distaste and sullenness lowered, puckering the stormy brows
  and blunting the finer lines. From brow to chin ran a thread-like scar, the
  mark of the lash of Devil Ferriby's whip six years ago.</p>

  <p>Irene stopped playing. She glanced towards the kitchen door; it was
  shut.</p>

  <p>'Paul,' she said softly, 'Paul.'</p>

  <p>He did not move, yet he stirred through all his frame at the sound of her
  voice. She rose and went to the sill, and, kneeling there, looked out and
  down.</p>

  <p>Paul Ferriby, this&mdash;Paul Ferriby...Irene smiled and touched his
  shoulder caressingly...so might Circe have smiled and touched one of the
  encased souls she had transformed.</p>

  <p>'Cross, Paul?' she murmured.</p>

  <p>He looked up at her slowly. 'Is that something more of Ferriby's
  giving?'</p>

  <p>'You mean the piano? Of course.' Irene laughed. 'When Cousin John promises
  me a thing, I have it. Why should I do without a piano? To make Cousin John
  pay and pay and pay is the only way to get even with him. He has done us out
  of money, I am sure.'</p>

  <p>Paul's answer was a sullen sound; then he moved, so suddenly and sharply
  she started back.</p>

  <p>'Curse Ferriby and his money!' he said. He fixed her with his grey eyes;
  the dark brows might scowl, the eyes adored. 'Are you beginning it with that
  fellow Gisberne, too?' he said.</p>

  <p>'That fellow Gisberne.' Irene laughed softly, 'Pray, who is he?' She
  curled her fingers softly about the young man's brow. 'Don't frown so, Paul;
  it spoils your beauty, and you're really awfully handsome, you know.'</p>

  <p>He grew still under the light caress.</p>

  <p>'Oh,' he broke out in a moment like a sick man who feels his delirium
  soothed, 'don't let this go on, Irene! You're true to me, eh? Come away.
  Marry me as you've promised. Give me a chance to get out of this before it is
  too late.'</p>

  <p>'Too late.' She smiled, still playing with his thick locks. 'You talk as
  if you were forty.'</p>

  <p>Paul caught her wrist. 'Why will you stay here under this roof? When you
  came back for good you promised me...'</p>

  <p>'Now, don't be unreasonable...'</p>

  <p>'Unreasonable! Look at me; look what I am!'</p>

  <p>'It's a shame,' she murmured. 'You work like a labourer.'</p>

  <p>'I am one. How else was I to stay here eating his bread? Oh, look here,
  Irene! Are you sure you do care? You keep me dangling on, and my heart's sick
  with it, and now that fellow Gisberne's going to hang round too...'</p>

  <p>'Who is that fellow Gisberne?' she interrupted. 'I have not even seen
  him.'</p>

  <p>'You passed him in the lane yesterday. He turned and looked after
  you.'</p>

  <p>'Oh.' Irene's expression changed by the slightest. 'Is that who it was?
  But you are such a dear old stupid. You can scarcely call that hanging
  round-meeting a stranger in a lane.'</p>

  <p>'It's what it will be.' Paul's face darkened. 'He is coming to live in
  Droitlet.' He caught her hand closer and straightened his big, slouching
  frame. 'Oh...' he breathed a strong word, '<i>do</i> you care, Irene?'</p>

  <p>'For you?'</p>

  <p>'For me.'</p>

  <p>She felt him tremble. How she loved it&mdash;to rouse them, these men; to
  see the heart-beat, the flush; to hear the stumbling words. She glanced a
  moment over her shoulder to acquaint herself that no one was there, then she
  bent down till her cheek touched his hair.</p>

  <p>'I care for you very much,' she murmured; 'you know I do. What a big,
  strong fellow you've grown. You could stand up to Cousin John now if it came
  to it, couldn't you? Do you remember the first time you did? A shame it
  should have marked your handsome face&mdash;but it hasn't spoilt it, you
  dear.'</p>

  <p>And she touched his cheek with her lips like the flicker of a flower, then
  caught herself back softly, laughing, keeping him off, telling him someone
  would come, he mustn't be so silly.</p>

  <p>The flush faded in Paul's face. 'That scar was for you,' he said
  hoarsely.</p>

  <p>'Oh, you said <i>not</i> at the time, you remember!' laughed Irene.</p>

  <p>'It was for you. And, look here, there are worse scars on me than
  that&mdash;on my heart and on my soul.' He pressed nearer to the window,
  catching her hands again. 'I'm a clod! After six years I'm still here, still
  turning that fellow's soil, still taking his bread.'</p>

  <p>'Don't be savage now.'</p>

  <p>'Savage! Wasn't my father a Ferriby? And yet here I am, my birthright sold
  to a fellow who disgraces the name. I hate him, I curse and loathe him; and
  yet look at me&mdash;here I still am.' His lips were white, his dark face
  full of passion; it pleased her eyes framed in the open window, the red of
  the geraniums giving the whole picture a true Spanish touch.</p>

  <p>'And it's my fault, you mean?' she said.</p>

  <p>'Fault! No&mdash;not if you are dealing fairly with me. It's for your sake
  I've stayed, because you asked me to, because you came and went, and because
  I couldn't live without the sight of you. And what have you always said?
  "Some day I will go away with you&mdash;I will be no one's wife if I am not
  yours."'</p>

  <p>Irene broke off a geranium spray silently, her eyes down-bent as if in
  thought. He stared at her.</p>

  <p>'How could I stay,' he whispered, 'and accept <i>favours</i> from
  him&mdash;charity? I've stayed like this for pay&mdash;a labourer! And now,
  you're ashamed of me.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, Paul...' She began to draw the flower spray through the buttonhole of
  his loose shirt.</p>

  <p>'I tell you,' he went on, unheeding her touch, but vibrating to it, as
  well she knew, 'it's cost me more than you'll ever understand. I say, Irene,
  you won't break my heart into the bargain, will you? I can't share the same
  roof with Ferriby much longer...I can't lead this life. Are you true to me?
  You smile on Ferriby&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Oh,' she interrupted, 'when will you understand that I like Cousin
  Ferriby no more than you do? If I had not cared about you, Paul, do you think
  I should have come back when I'd finished school? There were fifty other
  things I could have done. But before I leave Ferriby Grange I mean to know
  the truth of things. There is some trickery somewhere about uncle's will, and
  Jane Skidfell knows there was&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Hang their cursed money!' broke from Paul. 'Are you true to me?'</p>

  <p>But Irene sprang away from the window. She motioned to him&mdash;one of
  her girlhood's tricks&mdash;that someone was coming, and, dropping on the
  piano-stool, played chords at random.</p>

  <p>Paul, with a savage sound, turned from the casement, and came in through
  the entry.</p>

  <p>As he crossed the threshold of the room by the one door. Devil Ferriby
  strode in by the other.</p>

  <p>Six years had changed John Ferriby. He stands there as changed as Paul,
  and for the worse even more decidedly, because in a worse way.</p>

  <p>His hair, the same tint as Paul's, is grizzled; his face, dark-hued and
  tanned, is marked and lined by dissipation; but the free, bold air sits him
  as easily, and his dress is smart and jaunty. Smacking a silver-topped crop
  against his gaitered leg, he stood and stared at the spray of red in the
  'hired man's' blue shirt.</p>

  <p>In the lapel of Devil Ferriby's own well-fitting grey coat there blazed a
  crimson rose.</p>

  <p>Irene dropped her hands from the piano.</p>

  <p>'Helloa,' said Ferriby, roughly, taking no notice of her, 'what are
  <i>you</i> doing here?'</p>

  <p>Paul came up to within touch of him, and stood and gave him look for
  look.</p>

  <p>Then he passed on in silence, but with the latch of the door in his
  fingers, he gave a glance back at Ferriby, who had swung on his heel towards
  him.</p>

  <p>'Did you speak&mdash;to me?' he said. Irene sprang forwards.</p>

  <p>'I've had about enough of you!' cried Ferriby, still heeding only Paul,
  and he advanced threateningly.</p>

  <p>Irene shuddered, as she always had, with selfish, physical revulsion at
  the thought of a blow, the sight of blood. She ran between the two, ran up to
  Paul, let him see her eyes, let him feel the touch of her fingers on his
  wrist, and so, pulling open the unlatched door, pushed him gently through;
  then, closing it, leaned against it, listened a moment to hear that Paul was
  gone, then laughed into Devil Ferriby's face.</p>

  <p>'Never mind that great bear,' she said. 'Don't you want me to thank you
  for the new piano. Cousin John?'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-2"
     id="ch-1-2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">Irene Garth did not speak falsely when saying she remained
at Ferriby to
  find things out. There were many that puzzled her&mdash;Daphne Estorel in
  particular.</p>

  <p>She was not Jane Skidfell's niece; Irene felt pretty certain on that
  point. Daphne had been brought up as a gentlewoman more carefully than Irene
  herself, whose early years had encountered some very hard times and
  unpleasant expedients. Whence the beautiful name of Daphne Estorel? And why
  was the relative in Devonshire with whom she had spent much of her time of a
  grade so different on the face of it to Jane Skidfell? When in Devonshire
  Daphne was received on an equality with exclusive county gentry.</p>

  <p>Money had been spent upon her. Why should Cousin John do this? Irene had
  asked him, only to be warned off the subject with rough answers. To find out
  anything from Jane was as hopeless as striking a rock for water.</p>

  <p>Irene would have given much to know if Daphne shared the secret that must
  obviously be; but there was too much enmity, scarcely veiled, between them,
  though never open warfare.</p>

  <p>Irene's slights, and spite that went as far as it dared, fell away
  useless, blunted by Daphne's inviolable serene disdain. Why she stayed at the
  Grange, Irene could not fathom. She had discussed it with Paul and found she
  might as well discourse on the sunshine and the winds&mdash;he seemed to take
  Daphne as much for granted, as little needing explanation, as little within
  the compass of any explanation <i>he</i> could give. With Paul and Devil
  Ferriby alike infatuated for her, Irene could snap her fingers at Daphne
  Estorel as she did at Jane&mdash;yet another girl's bright, still presence
  about the place, another voice as soft as her own, hands as white and
  natheless far more useful, irked Irene. She hated Daphne. She felt her dead
  against her, but watch as she might, she could not tell which way the battle
  lay, nor what Daphne begrudged her, nor for what she silently fought.</p>

  <p>Why Irene herself chose to shut her rare beauty away from mankind in this
  isolated home, she could hardly have told. The laziness, largely, of her
  voluptuous nature. Curiosity had its share, a vindictive intention to thwart
  Daphne, and above everything, unrecognized because so pervading, the
  controlling influence that 'shapes our ends.' Besides, did she not come back
  every long summer vacation to queen it more and more over 'passion's slaves'?
  Those early threats as to Irene's future withered as weeds by the wayside
  before the heat of her charm. It seemed to everyone save Jane Skidfell, and
  perchance one or two others who were not at hand to witness all, that Devil
  Ferriby would marry Irene Garth. She lived with everything at her command,
  good food, good service, a horse to ride, a boat to row, untroubled leisure,
  money to spend. She was only twenty: time to her was infinite, and she reaped
  from its golden hours Cousin John's bold homage and Paul's mad and bitter
  passion, and so the six years had gone. But this summer swung to its zenith
  big with change.</p>

  <p>'Things will have to come to a head between they two soon,' said Jane. She
  was standing in the dairy watching Daphne skimming cream into a silver
  pitcher. Jane Skidfell's hard, fine face was dark with the austerity of one
  who looks on gloomily and prophetically at evil things. Her figure was
  sternly upright. In her handsome black gown with its touches of spidery fine
  lace at throat and wrists and on her iron-grey, abundant hair, Mistress
  Skidfell looked a Personage, and Daphne Estorel might call her aunt well
  without self-disparagement. But there was no other hint of kin. The dappling
  shadows from the pear-leaves outside the lattice rested on Daphne's bright,
  bent head and ivory-pale, still face. She was in a lilac gown with lace
  thrown fichu-wise about her shoulders.</p>

  <p>'Where be Paul Ferriby now?' asked Jane after awhile, Daphne making no
  reply to her first remark.</p>

  <p>'He is in the hay-field, I suppose, aunt.'</p>

  <p>'Aye, he eats his bread by the sweat of his brow,' said Jane; 'but I tell
  thee, Daphne, there'll be trouble. These days past, since that young, wanton
  lass had her pianny here, storm's been brewin'. Now, I want no Ferriby blood
  spilt. Devil Ferriby they call him, and they're right. He's bad to the core,
  but he's the master's son...'</p>

  <p>'What do you fear?' asked Daphne in a low voice.</p>

  <p>'Bloodshed, and between they two,' answered the old woman grimly.</p>

  <p>'Between Paul and John?' Daphne showed no tremor, but she ceased to
  skim.</p>

  <p>'Aye, between Paul and John! They're mad, both on them, for Irene Garth;
  and the one is the master's son and master here, and the other the man o' the
  field that holds his own from one se'n-night to the next.'</p>

  <p>'And yet they are both Ferribys,' struck in Daphne.</p>

  <p>'Aye, and both her cousins. But the telling of that tale is done with I
  There's a man come now who is no cousin.'</p>

  <p>'You mean Mr. Gisberne?' Daphne set down the ewer, a splendid old piece
  engraved with the Ferriby arms, its silver-gilt lining glowing pinky golden
  from the cream within.</p>

  <p>'Aye,' said Jane, turning to leave the dairy, but with keen eyes darting
  into every spot and cranny; 'this Muster Gisberne will bring things to a
  head. The wench is winning him, too, into her toils...'</p>

  <p>'I don't think so,' said Daphne quietly.</p>

  <p>Jane eyed her keenly. Daphne, carrying the silver ewer, followed her to
  the door. 'Wait one moment, aunt,' she said. 'You fear trouble, you say. Why
  do you not speak to Paul?'</p>

  <p>Jane shook her head. 'That is not for me, my lass.'</p>

  <p>'You spoke once&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Aye,' interrupted Jane. 'I've spoken once, twice, thrice. Three times
  have I put it to him to go away; three times have I bid him not shame his
  Ferriby blood, but get out of t' way of that false wench's wantonness. I've
  offered him the money. I've pointed him to t' open door in Devonsheer with
  friends of thine, but he's bound hand and foot in t' passion for that lass. I
  maun speak no more.'</p>

  <p>'Then what will you do?' said Daphne.</p>

  <p>''Tis in the hands of God,' answered Jane sternly. 'To-night I speak to
  the master.'</p>

  <p>'To John?' Daphne did not start, but her face showed a sudden glow as of
  flame upspringing behind transparent ivory.</p>

  <p>'Aye. He shall send Paul out of t' place and shut the gates of Ferriby on
  him for ever.'</p>

  <p>'But do you think that fair, Aunt Jane? Do you think that will stop
  ill-feeling or the risk of bloodshed?'</p>

  <p>'Aye, needs must it&mdash;if Paul Ferriby be at the other ends of t'
  earth.'</p>

  <p>Daphne's grave, bright eyes searched the old woman's face. 'Paul at the
  far ends of the earth!' she echoed in a strange voice. 'How will you get him
  there?'</p>

  <p>Jane gave her an answering, searching glance. 'I have thee in trust,' she
  said enigmatically, 'and Devil Ferriby is the master's son&mdash;my master,
  the man I served and the man I&mdash;' She broke off with a grim setting
  together of the thin, withering lips over the unuttered word. 'But what is
  Irene Garth to me?' she went on, lifting the latch. 'What is Paul? Irene
  Garth will never marry t' master's son. That's plain to me. Then, shall Paul
  hang? And shall there be Ferriby blood on the floors for the sake of one who
  makes folly with 'em both? Let un go. Let the two lads part, and let her be
  the means to it.'</p>

  <p>She passed on down the long passage, its runnel, full of clear water,
  purling past to encircle the great stone dairy and then flow limpid into a
  moss-lined trough beside the pear-tree roots.</p>

  <p>Daphne followed slowly, the silver ewer in her white hands.</p>

  <p>In the kitchen they entered there were a couple of buxom countryside
  wenches bustling between the huge oven and the white-scoured table. Baking
  was going on, the air filled with the tantalizing odour of oven bottoms and
  rich cakes. Apart from the finer cakes stood the vast array of pies and
  various baked meats to serve the harvesters and kitchen hands. There were
  flitches of bacon, and jars of jam brought from the store-room, ham ready to
  sizzle, oatcakes flung over the string line to dry, and in white osier
  baskets loaves of bread so different to loaves of bread that Sophy Bassett,
  on her arrival at the Grange six months ago, straight from Church Street,
  Paddington, did not know them by name. But this same Sophy Basset had rapidly
  overcome the drawback of first ignorances. In smart cap and gown she ruled
  the yokels in and out the back regions of Ferriby, and Jane Skidfell trusted
  her in much, even to the superintendence of the baking. Daphne Estorel's fair
  hands made the cakes and finer dainties; Jane still mixed and kneaded for
  bread and pies; Irene turned her lovely nose up at all domestic arts.</p>

  <p>'T' bakin' seems to ha' turned out well, lass,' said Jane.</p>

  <p>Sophy turned her bright, shrewd, sharply pretty face.</p>

  <p>'You're right, mum,' she said. 'Miss Daphne's ('Dephne,' Sophy made it)
  cheese-cakes in partickler. Oh lor, miss, that reminds me: Mr. John, he's
  just been in. "Tell Miss Dephne, Sophy," says he, "as there's been an
  accident in the hay field."' She started forward to catch the cream ewer, for
  it seemed as if Miss Daphne would let it fall.</p>

  <p>'An accident,' she echoed faintly.</p>

  <p>'Oh lor, miss, I didn't mean to frighten you. Only to one of they
  machines. But you wasn't to wait tea, Mr. John said. If Mr. Gisberne came and
  Mr. John was kept, you was just to go on without 'im.'</p>

  <p>'I have such a horror of accidents,' said Daphne, still faintly. Glancing
  up, she met Jane Skidfell's keen old eyes reading her, sifting her, knowing
  her. Sometimes to Daphne Jane was terrible as a figure of Fate, and she
  shrank from her.</p>

  <p>'Thee hast the key of the silver closet,' said Mistress Skidfell. 'All is
  in order&mdash;thee'lt want me no longer.' And she went her way from the
  kitchen to the room above, where, for nearly fifty years now, she had spent
  hard-earned rests, and slept the sleep of toil. Leisure had come to Jane
  Skidfell these later years, but her austerity had strengthened. With keen,
  unwearying zest she still guarded the money and stores of&mdash;' t' master's
  son,' though her thrift was a large thing, embracing plenty, an art of wide
  thoroughness, incapable of meanness; and she reaped what she had sown in long
  hours of secure retirement, when she brooded alone with her Bible. In these
  hours in the old servant's mind concentration of thought became almost a
  trance, and single interest gifted her to the point of seeing visions.</p>

  <p>'Has Mr. Paul been in to his tea?' asked Daphne, when Jane had gone.</p>

  <p>'Lor, miss, no! He don't trouble about no tea these days.' Sophy put on a
  fine air of understanding what haying-time meant. 'They're short-handed, too,
  I heerd Scarside say. Want me to come and ly the cloth now, miss?' added
  Sophy smartly.</p>

  <p>'No; I will do all that,' said Daphne, and, taking up the silver ewer
  again, she went slowly away by one of the many doors that kept the whole
  Grange in communication with the mighty kitchen&mdash;its heart and centre of
  life.</p>

  <p>Sophy looked after Miss Daphne's bright, softly moving figure, and into
  the sharp Cockney face, expressing till this moment absolutely nothing save
  cheerful alacrity, came a knowing look.</p>

  <p>Very knowing it was, with a hint of superior commiseration in it, and just
  a little speculation&mdash;only a very little. Sophy Bassett might not
  recognize a home-baked loaf of bread, but she had not been six weeks at
  Ferriby before she grasped what puzzled even Irene Garth. Much that might
  blind Irene did not hinder Sophy's vision. She knew 'right enough' why 'Miss
  Daphne' stayed at the Grange.</p>

  <p>Through the cool, hushed house Daphne went her way. Some of the rooms were
  almost bare of furniture, in others modern and costly pieces bought and
  brought here by John Ferriby's mother in her brief reign stood about,
  shrouded in brown holland. And yet how the old house kept its air! Had it not
  its wainscotings and panelled ceilings? In the deserted dining-hall was the
  stained-glass window set up by Mary Ferriby 'To the glory of God and in great
  thankfulness of heart that His Majesty lying here two nights in the time of
  the late rebellion, did escape without hurt or hindrance. Praise be to God.
  1660.'</p>

  <p>In the wide gallery above the centre stairs so seldom used was a long line
  of portraits, going back to Tudor days&mdash;none there of Devil Ferriby's
  father, Cornelius, nor of his grandfather. To all the finer rooms were carved
  mantels and perfect doors in perfect walls&mdash;and all these things and
  many more, ignored by John Ferriby, and left to Jane Skidfell's heed, made a
  glory that could smile at emptiness and that needed nothing of style to
  uphold it, or modern bolstering. Daphne Estorel loved the Grange better than
  anyone who dwelt within it. Its serene loneliness was akin to her. She knew
  not whose child she was, nor how she came to be here. A shadow of something
  forlorn seemed to rest upon her life, yet mated with a high courage that
  would not know defeat; and she found sympathy with both forlornness and
  courage in the beautiful old rooms and spaces.</p>

  <p>In her soul Daphne persuaded herself at times she, too, was a Ferriby, or
  else came at least from a race as old, and perhaps of higher strain, for
  Devil Ferriby mocked at state and scoffed at lineage; and Irene cared nothing
  save to boast she was a 'gentle,' and Paul had sold his birthright. But when
  Daphne Estorel opened the silver closet, as she did now, she was wont to
  thrill at its proud trophies of a nobler past. She could picture to herself
  Ferriby when those embossed tankards, duller now than lead, twinkled in the
  hands of the cavaliers as they toasted their King. With the aid of the
  ornaments that lay there forgotten, and the old discarded plate, Daphne would
  live again through many a gallant bright moment of history, in which the men
  and women of Ferriby had played a part, and, with the thrill of it still in
  her young and ardent blood, she would turn with love and sympathy to the old
  house that had lost it past recall.</p>

  <p>But this afternoon Daphne took down the silver that she needed without any
  fanciful dallying with what was dead and gone. Sense of life and pain in
  herself were to-day too keen. From the silver closet she went on to the huge
  black press where the finer household linens were stored, and then back
  through the kitchen to Irene's room.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gisberne was coming to tea, and, to suit Irene's whim, they were to
  sit down here.</p>

  <p>Gisberne was a musician, it seemed, and there was to be music; and since
  Cousin John was absurd, and would not keep proper servants, and throw open
  the dining-hall and the ladies' bower, Irene declared it was in <i>her</i>
  room the new-comer should receive his first impressions. That there was too
  much of Daphne Estorel's atmosphere in the old 'still-room'&mdash;the
  <i>lavender</i>-room, as they called it now&mdash;was the truth of it, only
  Irene and the truth of things were separate quantities.</p>

  <p>At Ferriby, leading its own life, thirty years behind the fashions of
  great towns, and, by all that was left of former greatness, mightily
  indifferent to them, an invitation to tea was a welcome to intimacy, a
  gallant occasion of brave hospitality.</p>

  <p>Daphne spread a fine cloth worked with a delicate cross-stitch by the
  hands of the Earl's daughter two generations ago, and then from the baskets
  she had filled she took the silver pieces rubbed by her own hands this
  morning, and arranged them with the best rose-sprigged china. It made an
  imposing show, though, had Daphne been in some moods, the quick tears might
  have sprung to her eyes as she looked on what was and thought of what might
  have been.</p>

  <p>But there was abundance to impress a stranger, and Daphne's white hands
  arranged with grace. Irene had no skill in even setting flowers in a vase;
  she had tossed that office to Daphne when she rode off that morning to the
  shore to bathe and loaf by the sea. Daphne, with regard to that line of red
  geraniums, had chosen bouquets of white and green, but in the centre of the
  table she had set blue lupins in a tall, clear glass.</p>

  <p>'Lor', miss, it do look a picter!' said Sophy, entering, and she moved
  forward on tiptoe as if she were coming in late to church. 'And shall you
  wait for Mr. John, miss? The tea-cakes is jest done to a turn.'</p>

  <p>'We must wait for someone,' said Daphne, smiling at her. 'And when Miss
  Garth comes she will have to change her dress. There is no hurry, Sophy. Be
  sure the water does not boil till I tell you to fill the urn. And remember
  how I showed you to change the plates. Don't get flustered, and be careful
  not to sniff, though you are almost quite cured of that. You look very nice.
  If you are as quick in the parlour as you are in everything else, you will be
  a very valuable servant, Sophy. And you have filled out so since you came.
  You are quite pretty. I am glad to look at you.'</p>

  <p>Sophy drooped abashed. She stole from the room again, shutting the door
  upon Miss Daphne with a sense of shame. The little Cockney girl preferred
  Miss 'Rene. If she could look as Miss 'Rene looked when she took her her
  early cup of tea, and found her a vision of beauty that Sophy's limited
  memories could only liken to a pantomime fairy or a mermaid; if she could
  only get some young man to glower at her and to turn and watch her as Mr.
  John and that Mr. Paul glowered after Miss 'Rene, Sophy thought she could die
  happy. To have clothes like Miss 'Rene, to wear them as she did, and have
  such a face and ways&mdash;-Sophy Bassett could conceive of nothing more to
  envy.</p>

  <p>Miss Daphne did not appeal to her nearly so much. She had never seen her
  with hair unbound or arms and shoulders bare. To Sophy's mind Daphne was
  always dressed, always composed, low-toned and gravely bright, always caring
  for household things. 'And to be in 'love with Mr. Paul!' Sophie pitied her
  with a half contempt. 'As if Miss Daphne had a chanst against Miss
  'Rene.'</p>

  <p>Yet Miss Daphne's words of praise were so sweet that Sophy felt ashamed to
  take them, as if some bright presence she had passed and passed and gazed
  upon slightingly had stooped, and, passing a hand over her hair, given her a
  sensation from another world.</p>

  <p>Daphne looked slowly round the room, a room hateful to her&mdash;hateful
  I</p>

  <p>There was nothing more to do; everything left to her to control was in the
  perfection of order and elegance. She would not sit down in the chairs Irene
  used; she passed through the stone-flagged entry, cool to chilliness even
  that hot afternoon, and into the little bit of garden beyond.</p>

  <p>She looked along the box-edged path to the gate into the stackyard. Of
  this only a section was visible&mdash;the ground, golden with dragged straw
  and painted with a big shadow from a half-seen rick. Into the shadow round
  the rick suddenly stepped Paul; at the same instant, seeing Daphne, he
  stopped abruptly and then came forward, slowly fixing his eyes upon her, but
  giving neither smile nor greeting, yet his face changed. He was in the
  coloured shirt and the rough clothes he always wore. As has been said: that
  he looked the handsomer for them was no fault of his, for it was plain here
  was a young man who took his good looks rather more than most as a matter
  bearing very little on the question of existence. But handsome he was, with
  that indication of self-containment, that suggestion of 'something reserved
  for someone&mdash;'that is the mark of true virility and its chief
  attraction. As Daphne looked at him she turned dizzy with the pain of it.
  From head to foot Paul bore the marks of his bondage.</p>

  <p>'You?' he said, reaching her; 'it's hot, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'Very hot. Were you coming in to tea?'</p>

  <p>'Tea!' He laughed shortly. 'No; I wasn't exactly thinking of tea.' He
  leant against the worn stone of the doorway, in the arch of which Daphne
  stood. There was no need for his smothered glance towards the casement to
  tell why he was there, nor for further telling than Daphne's presence here
  that Irene was not in the room. He stood silently sullen, lowering. Far more
  than Irene Garth's lavish beauty did Daphne's still bright presence show up
  how far below that first estate of his frank boyhood Paul Ferriby had
  dropped.</p>

  <p>Daphne could not bear to look at him, and he kept silence, making no
  excuses, a truant from work, here doggedly to see Irene, to encounter
  Ferriby&mdash;anything. In Daphne's heart in that pause something suddenly
  went out, as a candle, flickering bravely to the last, will suddenly drop
  into darkness. It was hope...</p>

  <p>Daphne was twenty-two. From the first moment her eyes had met Irene
  Garth's six years ago she had silently disputed with her the possession of
  Paul Ferriby; at first, merely in the antagonism of a fine nature with a low
  one, but latterly, with all her woman's soul and flesh and blood.</p>

  <p>And she had strangely hoped that in her silence she was drawing him, that
  silently she had a hold, thwarting Irene, and keeping him, at least, upon his
  feet. To-day, now, as he stood beside her, the warm quiet seemed to pulsate
  with Jane Skidfell's grim threats, and she glanced round into Paul's brooding
  face and suddenly knew him lost to her. Hope went out, and Daphne, under the
  pang and woe of it, stifled a cry.</p>

  <p>There came a sound of horses' hoofs and laughing voices. The two were
  startled from their abstraction.</p>

  <p>'Paul,' said Daphne with the new firmness of that sudden blankness in her
  soul, 'Mr. Gisberne is coming...'</p>

  <p>'I know.' Paul's brows were scowling, his rough hands clenched.</p>

  <p>Daphne put her hand on his arm; she had not touched him for long, long,
  long...' Sit down with us,' she said. 'I mean, at this meal...at tea...Oh,
  assert yourself&mdash;sit down with us&mdash;Mr. Gisberne's equal, Paul, for
  pity's sake&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Paul turned his eyes on Daphne's face. He did not seem surprised at her
  intensity. He took everything that came with Daphne Estorel as he took the
  sun and winds, veiled or shining, cold or soft, the same, and nothing to
  wonder at.</p>

  <p>'I'll not sit down at Ferriby's table,' he said hoarsely. 'I eat the bread
  I earn, and there's an end of it.'</p>

  <p>'Paul, I entreat you. Take this moment when a stranger is coming. Sit down
  a Ferriby...'</p>

  <p>'And be thrown from the place to-morrow?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, that is what I mean. It is coming to that.'</p>

  <p>'Aye.' Paul laughed, looking away from her down the lane, where in another
  moment the riders would come into sight behind the elms.</p>

  <p>'Then meet it as John Ferriby's <i>equal</i>&mdash;a Ferriby and a
  gentleman...Assert yourself <i>first</i>. Sit down to-night, a Ferriby, a
  gentleman, whom he dare not <i>strike&mdash;again</i>&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Paul glanced at her strangely, then away, 'I've sold my birthright,' he
  muttered. 'If he does anything of that sort I suppose I shall kill
  him&mdash;but I'm not going to leave Ferriby till&mdash;' The pleasant
  champing of the bits and bridle-chains was now close by, and men's voices and
  Irene's charming laugh. From behind the elm-clump she came first into sight,
  the bright chestnut she rode stepping daintily. Devil Ferriby was beside her
  stirrup, and the other side of her the new-comer, Mr. Robert Gisberne, finely
  mounted and sitting his horse well.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-3"
     id="ch-1-3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Robert Gisberne had made John Ferriby's acquaintance by
renting one of
  his cottages at Droitlet. He was needing rest and change after some years
  roughing it in the States, where he had at last struck oil after some unnamed
  fashion, and made, presumably, a little money.</p>

  <p>Devil Ferriby had no mind to increase his circle of friends; he was
  self-centred and disliked the amenities of life. His few intimates, men and
  women, were among his inferiors, but Gisberne had an ingratiating manner and
  assumed no airs. Also he gave a bank reference and produced a solicitor's
  credentials. Ferriby let him the cottage, and found himself insensibly
  attracted to Gisberne's company.</p>

  <p>The fellow could do what Ferriby could: ride, handle a gun, manoeuvre a
  sailing craft, and by some degrees not so skilfully&mdash;enough, however,
  for congeniality. He was remarkably taciturn, with the gift of drawing speech
  from others. When he did speak it was to the point, and conveyed the idea
  forcibly that he meant his words. He played cards a little too well. That,
  however, was not in evidence at sight. At sight it was apparent that his
  hands and teeth were nice, his dress good, and his whole
  appearance&mdash;with nothing distinctive to mark it, boyishly smooth brown
  hair, clean-shaven lip and chin, and very ordinary eyes-was, all the same,
  singularly pleasant.</p>

  <p>Pleasant was the word for Gisberne, and about him an easy detachment that,
  taken with his silence, produced the effect of some unconscious reminiscence
  in him of finer things than these around him now.</p>

  <p>But Daphne Estorel, who had a sense for it as some people have for
  colours, did not take Gisberne for all he seemed.</p>

  <p>He rode his horse well, yet not quite as Ferriby did. As the party came
  near, Ferriby flung his hand up to his hat at sight of her in the porch;
  Gisberne raised his from his head. But John's way was one thing, Gisberne's
  another&mdash;the difference was integral, unconscious; it lay in breed.</p>

  <p>Not that Daphne weighed that now. Her hand had dropped from Paul's arm as
  Irene's chestnut rounded the elms, but she did not move from her place, nor
  did Paul.</p>

  <p>Irene, with a light motion of the head to them, drew rein at the gate, and
  Ferriby dismounted her. Gisberne got lightly and easily to the ground. Daphne
  moved to give greeting, and Paul, suddenly rousing, followed her. He threw
  off his slouch for these few steps. He couldn't alter his shirt-sleeves and
  bare neck, but, drawing himself up, every inch of his height and breadth had
  play. He dwarfed Gisberne, and put Devil Ferriby into the second place.
  Having given no greeting to anyone, it was the more evident that his sudden
  movement meant something, and the air was charged with it. Yet Ferriby seemed
  not to see his cousin. Daphne felt a sudden elation spite of underlying fear.
  Her words, after all, had been an inspiration...</p>

  <p>'You don't ride. Miss Estorel,' said Gisberne, opening the wicket for
  Irene. 'I'll take my horse, Mr. Ferriby. I guess you're short-handed these
  days.' That Gisberne gave way to speech was plain sign he had noticed
  something and was good-humouredly giving cover.</p>

  <p>Devil Ferriby turned with a little laugh for Gisberne and a look straight
  at Paul.</p>

  <p>Even Irene caught her breath. Into the minds of the four sprang that day
  when they all first met, when Devil Ferriby had bidden his penniless cousin
  bed down his horse&mdash;would he try it now with the fellow who took his
  wages? No.</p>

  <p>The two kept their eyes on one another a few seconds with an understanding
  of hate plainly to be seen, but Ferriby attempted no advantage of inequality.
  The matter was put aside for adjustment another time as between two men upon
  a level.</p>

  <p>'I shall find someone in the yard,' he said. 'Go into the house, Mr.
  Gisberne.'</p>

  <p>Daphne turned, quivering with the triumph of it. Paul was not hers, would
  never be: he was doomed; that look just now was open war, and Paul must go or
  the terror of bloodshed settle down. Yet for all that might be, that must be,
  this moment now was sweet. The slavish fear of being driven out of sight of
  Irene had not weighed&mdash;at last&mdash;against her inspiration! As Daphne
  turned, not able for the joy of it to look at Paul or gather what he did, she
  heard Irene laugh delicately behind her.</p>

  <p>'You know my cousin Paul, Mr. Gisberne?' she said; and Daphne, glancing
  round, caught the dart of malice in the lovely eyes. 'So you've been
  meddling, have you?' they said. 'See how you are rewarded.'</p>

  <p>'Mr. Paul and I know something of each other,' answered Gisberne in his
  pleasant, sparing, yet all comprehensive way.</p>

  <p>Irene, gathering up her holland skirt, slipped her hand under Paul's
  arm.</p>

  <p>'We're two Ferribys to whom the Grange does <i>not</i> belong,' she said
  charmingly, 'and so we're the better friends. It's nice of you, Paul, to
  leave the fields for once&mdash;I see nothing of you in summer weather;' and
  she led him gently ahead, a slave to her touch, and passed into the
  house.</p>

  <p>There come to all of us moments when we feel strongly that life is ending
  a chapter. There is to be a pause of days, hours, or seconds while the book
  is smoothed open afresh and another page turned. This was such a pause for
  Daphne. She moved on after Irene in a strange blank of feeling.</p>

  <p>Gisberne, in deference to the occasion, had ridden up in plain dress, but
  the road from Droitlet was treeless and dry as chalk. He laid down whip and
  hat on the oak settle in the entry. 'Now, if you had such a thing as a whisk.
  Miss Estorel?' he said, glancing himself down.</p>

  <p>Daphne opened the door of a small chamber built out by Cornelius Ferriby
  for the benefit of merry roysterers too far gone to face the pitch-black
  night ride home, and who from hence should slip out at the break of day
  unobserved and unwist of by the women. It was fitted now in simple fashion
  for Ferriby's rare visitors of the male kind. Gisberne entered&mdash;he was
  to know this little chamber.</p>

  <p>Daphne herself stepped on into the living-room. Irene, in the centre of
  it, resting her arms upon Paul's crossed ones, leant against him and looked
  up into his dark, passionate face.</p>

  <p>'You must, Paul,' she was saying; 'you shall. You <i>are</i> a
  Ferriby.'</p>

  <p>'I will not eat his bread, nor sit at his table.' Paul did not see that
  Daphne entered: he only saw Irene's upturned face. Irene did not move; she
  knew who was there.</p>

  <p>'Oh, you proud baby!' She caught his face down and kissed him on the
  cheek. 'But I will not have you a labourer, <i>my</i> cousin. Paul&mdash;to
  please me...'</p>

  <p>He put her away from him roughly, turned dizzily and swung away and out of
  the room. It was plain he was half-blinded, driven beyond himself by the
  touch of her lips.</p>

  <p>'How ridiculous these men are,' said Irene, to anyone who chose to hear.
  She turned nonchalantly towards the door upstairs.</p>

  <p>'Oh, by-the-by. Miss Estorel,' she said, as if only then aware of Daphne,
  'I have just told Paul he must sit down with us this evening. It is absurd he
  should give the impression he is not a member of the family. A place had
  better be left for him. He's not small enough to fit in anywhere.'</p>

  <p>There was a cool laugh. The burnished latch of the door rose and fell like
  a little snap of mockery&mdash;Irene was gone.</p>

  <p>So, <i>she</i> had snatched the triumph; she was so sure of Paul she could
  proclaim that he would do her bidding without even the shadow of a consent
  from him. If Paul sat down with them it would be because Irene bade him.</p>

  <p>Gisberne through the half-open door saw Daphne bending over the table,
  and, though by no means an adept at observation except in one direction,
  where it was keen as a bloodhound is all scent, he could judge she bore her
  share in the family breach&mdash;and the breach concerned Irene. That he had
  gathered already.</p>

  <p>Now, on whose side was this fair, still lady enlisted? He pushed open the
  door gently, and Daphne glancing up, their eyes met. Daphne had said she did
  not think Gisberne was smitten with Irene&mdash;there had certainly been no
  love at sight, no headlong submission; and now she saw in the pleasant,
  commonplace eyes unmistakable admiration of herself. But Gisberne said
  nothing. He was far from shy. He was not embarrassed. His air of unnoticing
  unconcern might very well convey that he was too used to the surroundings of
  ancient gentry to notice them. Yet Daphne felt magnetically he was impressed
  and taken aback. He made no remark on the fine room, the wonderful length of
  window, the queer piece of carving let into the panels over the mantel,
  treasure-trove from a Spanish galleon three hundred years ago; he remained
  seemingly unaware of the silver pieces on the table, the uncommon napery, and
  egg-shell china. It was a detachment too complete. Either it was assumed to
  cover ignorance, or it was the natural effect of soullessness. So might a dog
  or panther come into the living-room of Ferriby Grange.</p>

  <p>It was proof of the new-comer's power of drawing attention to himself that
  Daphne should think about him and this aspect of him even now. At length
  Gisberne commented on the piano, and sat down to it.</p>

  <p>'I imagine Miss Garth will take no exception to my trying it right away,'
  he said. He played very softly, and with a peculiar precision and tinkle in
  the touch-tricky, not that of any trained musician, but with expert skill,
  remarkably at home with the keys.</p>

  <p>'What is that piece, Mr. Gisberne?' asked Daphne, and she left the table
  where she was silently directing Sophy, and moved to the dais as if drawn
  there.</p>

  <p>'Give it a name,' said Gisberne, smiling at her. 'I don't know one.'</p>

  <p>'Is it your own, then?'</p>

  <p>'Why, yes.'</p>

  <p>'You are improvising?' Daphne's tone was eager. Over her music of any sort
  had influence.</p>

  <p>'I do nothing else.'</p>

  <p>'You play written music as well?'</p>

  <p>'Not a note! I'll do this for you on any instrument you like to give
  me&mdash;on a teacup, with a spoon.' Gisberne laughed pleasantly. 'I'm fine,
  too, on the violin.'</p>

  <p>'It is wonderful&mdash;to me,' sighed Daphne softly; 'most wonderful.'</p>

  <p>Gisberne played a moment in silence, she watching him absorbed. It was
  like rain pattering on leaves and a bird's drowsy notes and&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Do me a favour. Miss Estorel,' said Gisberne, looking up. 'Say nothing
  about the teacup and the spoon&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'You mean&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I do, just that. A secret. I play a few things by ear, from memory. There
  I begin, there I end.'</p>

  <p>'Isn't that selfish, Mr. Gisberne?'</p>

  <p>'It is.'</p>

  <p>Daphne could not resist the pleasant look in these pleasant, everyday
  eyes. She smiled. 'I'm not to say you improvise?'</p>

  <p>'If you please.'</p>

  <p>'Very well. On one condition.'</p>

  <p>'I know it&mdash;that I play upon the teacup with the spoon for you. I
  will, when we're alone. That's a bargain. Miss Estorel.'</p>

  <p>Daphne laughed&mdash;a little low, bright note rarely heard. She was like
  an instrument strained to breaking-pitch suddenly unstrung enough to save the
  snap.</p>

  <p>It was gratification to her, too, soothing every fibre, that Irene,
  stepping into the room again that moment, should have heard her laugh.</p>

  <p>Daphne Estorel's still brightness, her pale glory of colouring, her slow
  movements and steady glance, stood for saintliness to many, for coldness,
  incapacity of passion. Sophy, for all her shrewd discrimination, placed her
  in a niche, like the stone figures she had seen above church doors, who lived
  for ever in a mantle. Devil Ferriby had much the same idea. Paul&mdash;but
  Paul's thoughts of Daphne were a sense, uncatalogued, of so wide a sweep they
  encircled his mad passions, even as the winds and sunlight encircled him.</p>

  <p>Jane Skidfell knew something of Daphne's heart; Irene probed for it so far
  vainly. Scarcely to Daphne herself was it plain how great or strong her share
  of fierce emotion, anger, jealousy, revenge, and hate. But she was glad Irene
  should hear her laugh. If Irene guessed her secret, if the warfare were to be
  open now instead of hidden, she was glad Irene should have found her close to
  Gisberne&mdash;should have heard her laugh and seen him smile at her.</p>

  <p>For Irene was attracted by Gisberne, and he, not yet by her and Daphne,
  knew it, and she was glad, verily very glad, to deal Irene out one smart.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">That night, between ten and eleven, a late hour for the
Grange, Ferriby
  sat smoking alone beside the black oak bureau. The flap was down, and on it
  stood a single candle burning. The flame did little more than pick out John
  Ferriby's head and face. The night was intensely warm, and held its own
  light; the dark without was scarcely more than a thick dusk. All the
  casements of the long window stood wide open. The piano was in plain outline,
  the uncovered keys faintly gleaming. Every sign of the little feast was gone,
  but Ferriby was looking towards the spot where the table had stood, and his
  thoughts were busy with it.</p>

  <p>It was a strange thing for him, Devil Ferriby, to have been sitting down
  like that with a couple of girls and a stranger! He didn't know why he'd done
  it&mdash;as if Gisberne had been a new parson or some Devonshire 'swell' on a
  visit to Daphne. He had none of Daphne's fancies. Ferriby did not go below
  the surface nor seek in his acquaintance for the characteristics of a
  gentleman, but he rather wondered he should be attracted by Gisberne, and
  feel the desire to have him about him. That the desire and the attraction
  were much the same thing as prompted him when he bought a horse or tolerated
  a dog across his feet did not occur to him. He made no similes. Gisberne did
  not seem to be assuming anything, and as for soullessness, much Devil Ferriby
  thought of the soul! What he had noticed during the lavish meal and the
  hour's desultory talk and entertainment following was that Irene Garth 'had
  thrown herself at the fellow's head.' And the young witch had flouted him
  into the bargain, announcing with that air of hers that she had bidden Paul
  come in to tea. Well, the sulky ruffian had known better&mdash;he had not
  'come in to tea.' But my lady had better take care&mdash;she had better take
  care how she set him and that upstart beggar too far by the ears.</p>

  <p>The door from the kitchen quarters opened gently, and John looked round
  sharply, half startled.</p>

  <p>'Is it thou, John Ferriby?' said Mistress Skidfell's voice.</p>

  <p>'Hello!' answered Ferriby, not over-pleased at the intrusion. He was
  waiting&mdash;not for Jane Skidfell.</p>

  <p>'I've come to speak to thee awhile,' said Jane, advancing into the
  candle-light and showing herself fully dressed, the filmy lace still on her
  grey hair, her figure stern and forbidding as ever. Jane Skidfell had been
  finely handsome once in some girlhood not so far off by reason of years as by
  change of nature. 'Put out the light,' she said. 'I can say what has to be
  said in t' dark, and that wench, Irene Garth, is not in t' house yet. We can
  see her the better wi'out t' candle if she comes creepin' to t' window to
  listen.'</p>

  <p>Ferriby snuffed out the candle, laughed, and rattled the silver tongs into
  the tray again. 'What's up now?' he demanded. He paid Jane scant outward
  respect. It never entered his head to disobey her.</p>

  <p>'This: I'll have no bloodshed in this house.' She spoke, and sat down in
  one of the chairs carved for backs rigid as hers. Ferriby was a few feet away
  in his seat by the bureau&mdash;nothing between them.</p>

  <p>'Oh, that's an old scare, Jane,' he answered. 'It was always my father's
  notion he'd be murdered, and his father's before him. Who's to shed blood?
  You've been having dreams again.'</p>

  <p>'I have. Strange dreams of thee. I have had one this afternoon...Thee'lt
  get rid of thy Cousin Paul.'</p>

  <p>'Do you think <i>he</i> means to murder me?' Ferriby laughed dryly.</p>

  <p>'I said no word o' murder,' answered Jane. 'I spoke of the shedding of
  blood. It may be thine spilt or his; it may be but a blow or it may be death,
  but it's threatening. He and thee are like two young bulls in the one herd.
  Thee'lt get rid of Paul.'</p>

  <p>'How?' asked Ferriby, after a silence. 'Do you think turning him out of
  the Grange will alter things? How far would he go, think you? Do <i>I</i>
  never stir beyond the gates? Can't we meet at Droitlet or Petsham
  or&mdash;ten miles off? I'm not sure that I wouldn't rather keep the young
  devil under my own eyes here.' And Ferriby took out his pouch and began to
  fill his pipe.</p>

  <p>'But thee shalt not,' said Jane across the dark. 'He shall take himself
  off to the far ends of f earth.' Ferriby interjected a scornful
  laugh.&mdash;' I say he shall,' the old servant's voice rose, 'and it's Irene
  Garth who'll set him on his way.'</p>

  <p>'Irene! Not she! She'd love to see us at each other's throats.'</p>

  <p>'Dost thee care for the wench?' asked Jane sternly.</p>

  <p>Ferriby laughed, and struck a vesta sharply. As the light flared up he
  looked across and met Jane's keen, searching, withered eyes. He laughed
  again.</p>

  <p>'I don't quite see myself looking on while she marries someone else,' he
  said shortly.</p>

  <p>'Dost thee mean to marry her thysen?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know.' Ferriby spoke impatiently. 'She's all right here, isn't
  she&mdash;my cousin? You're in the place, and Daphne...She's a young witch.
  Marry her...she might have something to say about it; but if it isn't Cousin
  John it shan't be Cousin Paul!'</p>

  <p>He laughed again, and the bowl of his pipe glowed suddenly and
  fiercely.</p>

  <p>'Aye, aye,' answered Jane strongly, 'and what's he saying in his
  heart?&mdash;"If it isn't Cousin Paul it shan't be Cousin John." Now, thee'll
  listen to me, John Ferriby. Irene Garth is not worth an honest woman's
  thoughts. I doubt if thee'lt marry her. As for her mind in t' matter, a
  Ferriby has ever done as he thought with t' woman he chose, and thou art no
  exception. But this Paul is a Ferriby, too, mind thee, and he loves wi' a
  cleaner heart than thou dost. I like t' lad. I'd ha' saved him from this
  mysen, but he wouldna' listen, an' he'll never listen to aught save the wench
  hersen. Now, to Irene Garth I'll not demean mysen to speak&mdash;she cares
  for neither of thee. But thee shalt speak to her, John Ferriby, and now, when
  she comes in from her wanton idlings.'</p>

  <p>'She's not alone,' interrupted Ferriby. 'The Ibimays are with her.'</p>

  <p>'Thou'lt speak to her when she comes in,' said Jane, unheeding. 'I have
  forebodings. I will have no harm happen to thee. Thou art t' master's son.'
  Her voice softened and trembled. 'Irene Garth is t' one to make Paul go, and
  she shall.'</p>

  <p>'Play Delilah with him, eh?' said Ferriby. As a child, Jane had read the
  Bible to him and spared not.</p>

  <p>'Aye.' The old woman rose, looking ghostly to Ferriby, standing there
  facing him upright in the dark. 'Now, keep back thy sneers as to the right
  and wrong of it, and keep back thy boast that thou canst snap thy fingers at
  Paul Ferriby. Thou canst not. He is as fine a man&mdash;he has a cleaner
  soul&mdash;but thou art t' master's son. I give fair warning, John: Irene
  Garth shall use hersen to part the twain of ye, or I set her with my own
  hands out upon t' road, and Paul may follow her&mdash;'</p>

  <p>And without any greeting or word to end it, like the phantom visitant she
  almost seemed, Jane turned, and Ferriby could only be sure she was gone by
  the click of the latch softly falling into place.</p>

  <p>He instantly rose, lit the candle again, and glanced at the time. Twenty
  to eleven. Irene could not be long now. He moved to the window, and sat down
  there. Jane's visit for once had chimed with his mood. All his life had used
  him to her stern, unloving exhortations. Expressions, startling in another,
  came naturally from Jane, and with the same effect and impersonal bearing as
  pulpit denunciation; but to-night Ferriby's feelings were in tune with the
  words, and gave them full value.</p>

  <p>There was no need for Jane Skidfell to fill out her sentences for Devil
  Ferriby. She threatened to turn Irene out of doors, and Ferriby believed she
  had the power, with all that the use of that power involved in showing him up
  as being master of Ferriby Grange-yes, <i>under her</i>.</p>

  <p>What Jane's power actually was John did not know. Lawyer Winch held the
  secret, no one else. But well John knew his father Cornelius had had a
  crooked mind; the bad strain was in him and his father before him. Devil
  Ferriby had no particular mind to pry into his father's vagaries. He was
  content to take the mastership and the money and leave Jane her mystery and
  her own way. But he believed in her hidden power. Jane Skidfell and her grim
  talk had been handed on to him by his father almost as a superstition.
  Another superstition was this very fear of bloodshed. Ferriby knew it by
  heart. He had mocked, scoffed, laughed at it, and seen his father, haunted by
  it, die in his bed of a silly fever after a hunting chill! But tonight he was
  depressed. Things took form. Hitherto Irene had been coming and going, half a
  child; now she was here 'for good,' here to live, here to abide till her
  destiny be settled. It had grown plain that issues would not longer be kept
  indefinitely in abeyance.</p>

  <p>He hated Paul&mdash;he would have swept him from his sight long ago, only
  somehow the whelp kept out of his way, and was useful, and had struck a
  fool's bargain to serve seven years with him for hire.</p>

  <p>'Seven years! He was thinking of Jacob serving for Rachel,' thought
  Ferriby with a sneer of sudden illumination, his mind stirred to Biblical
  recollections by the flavour of Jane's talk. 'Well, he'll find himself
  "left." I suppose he'd better go. I suppose I'd better put Irene up to it.
  She'll lend herself to that sort of thing fast enough, the young jade...Marry
  her! Humph! I don't know...' Another face rose in Ferriby's mind&mdash;not
  Irene's&mdash;a face dark almost as his own, with passionate, entreating
  eyes...He moved uneasily. Pshaw! Irene was his cousin; he was fond of her, he
  petted her. Ah! there she was...His heart gave a leap, spite of himself. A
  slim figure, beautiful even through the dusk, had stolen up on silent
  footsteps to the gate. And the dusk seemed to grow perfumed round her, and
  the light air to blow with sudden warmth. The light figure seemed to see at
  once the outline at the casement. It stopped, affrighted.</p>

  <p>'Cousin John, is it you?' came a whisper after the startled pause.</p>

  <p>'Who else should it be?' said Ferriby. 'What do you mean by being out so
  late?'</p>

  <p>And he rose to meet her as she entered.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-4"
     id="ch-1-4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">She fluttered in guiltily, with a delightful coaxing laugh
and pleading
  gesture, breathless. There was about her a little air of stealing hurriedly
  away, sped by some pleasant past excitement.</p>

  <p>'Have you shut the door?' asked Ferriby.</p>

  <p>'No.' He stepped down the entry and softly shot the bolt. He wanted the
  moment the doing of it gave him, for with her actual presence the blood had
  flown to his head somewhat. It was suddenly and rather savagely clear to him
  that, leaving Paul out of the question, the idea of Irene and another
  man&mdash;this Gisberne fellow, for instance&mdash;was absurd.</p>

  <p>Irene stood waiting for him, swinging her big hat.</p>

  <p>'Whatever is this for, Cousin John?'</p>

  <p>'I'll have that door blocked up,' said Ferriby. He came to her where she
  stood beside the bureau instinctively seeking the light.</p>

  <p>'What do you mean?' she pouted. 'It's barely half past ten...'</p>

  <p>'A quarter to eleven...'</p>

  <p>'A quarter to eleven, then, and a July night. The Ibimays walked with me
  to the top of the lane...John&mdash;dear, sweet John, if you are going to
  begin this sort of thing there's an end of everything.'</p>

  <p>'There'll be an end of that door,' returned John dryly.</p>

  <p>Irene pouted, mocking him in her heart.</p>

  <p>'Where have you been?' he demanded.</p>

  <p>'Good gracious, Cousin John, I walked with the Ibimays and Mr. Gisberne to
  the cross-roads. He rode on there. We turned back, and I've been strolling up
  and down beside their pony-carriage ever since. Why on earth not, this
  beautiful night?'</p>

  <p>'You've been with Gisberne alone,' said John shortly.</p>

  <p>Irene turned him her shoulder with a little shrug...</p>

  <p>If he was going to begin that&mdash;</p>

  <p>'I should like something to eat,' she remarked. 'I had scarcely any
  tea.'</p>

  <p>'No; you were too busy throwing yourself at Gisberne's head.'</p>

  <p>'You are simply horrid,' returned Irene. 'May I have this candle a
  minute?'</p>

  <p>'Where are you going?'</p>

  <p>'To find something to eat.' She changed her tone. 'Come with me. Cousin
  John&mdash;to protect me.'</p>

  <p>'From the mice?'</p>

  <p>'I'm not afraid of mice. That's one of men's delusions. But I am afraid of
  Jane. She's a witch; she never sleeps; she might hear and come down.'</p>

  <p>Ferriby suffered the girl to slip her hand under his arm and lead him out
  through the kitchen to the larder door, a small larder left open at night to
  suit the master, who might want to help himself when all the household was
  a-bed. Cautiously Irene entered, and John stood in the doorway, holding the
  light, watching her, tolerant and scoffing.</p>

  <p>Irene was very fond of dainties, always greedy of nice things, very
  attentive to her stomach. She turned her nose up at the pasty, flouted the
  one jar of ale, made a grimace at the cheese, and finally selected some apple
  jelly and a slice of cake.</p>

  <p>'What on earth good will that stuff do you?' scoffed John. He took the
  opportunity and helped himself to a mugful of ale.</p>

  <p>As they turned from the pantry, Irene carrying her spoils&mdash;the cake
  beside the jelly in the one glass dish-Ferriby laid his hand on her shoulder,
  and, turning her about, pointed through one of the many doors&mdash;some
  standing open&mdash;down the passage that ended in the buttery.</p>

  <p>'Do you remember the time Jane locked you in there?' he said.</p>

  <p>'I remember how hateful you were.' Irene pulled herself away. 'I shall
  have to use one of the kitchen spoons, I suppose. Please bring the candle,
  Cousin John.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose if you were mistress here you wouldn't care whether the silver
  was locked up or not,' said John behind her.</p>

  <p>'But I'm not the mistress here.' She took spoon and fork from the drawer
  and flitted away before him back to the living-room. 'Do let us have a little
  more light,' she said. Another characteristic of Irene: she still retained
  her old fear of the dark&mdash;the dark of a house; she burnt a light all
  night in her wide room upstairs. Ferriby, following her quickly but
  cautiously, latched the door, cautiously also, as if he also would run no
  risk of disturbance, and set the candle again on the flap of the bureau.</p>

  <p>'Look here,' he said abruptly, 'you don't want to sit and eat that
  now.'</p>

  <p>'I do. I'm hungry.' Serenely she commenced on the jelly, and broke off a
  mouthful of the cake. She had seated herself in the old-fashioned chair,
  regal in shape and with broad arms wide enough for a man's glass and pipe,
  black with age, polished, and as strong as smooth.</p>

  <p>John watched her a moment longer. Everything Irene did was done
  charmingly. She looked up suddenly with a bewitching grimace. 'What is the
  matter? You make me nervous.'</p>

  <p>'You nervous!' Ferriby caught the glass dish away from her and set it down
  beside the candle. 'It would make some girls nervous to be in your shoes now;
  but not you.' He seated himself on the arm of the chair.</p>

  <p>'What do you mean?' asked Irene stoutly; but she made no attempt, playful
  or otherwise, to recover her supper.</p>

  <p>'I reminded you just now of that buttery affair years ago,' said Ferriby.
  'You rather enjoyed it, didn't you?'</p>

  <p>'Enjoyed it!'</p>

  <p>'Enjoyed it, my little beauty. You like to set folks by the ears. Do you
  know what I believe your little game is now? To work that sulky lout up to
  making a shindy with me, and then, when we've damaged each other to your
  heart's content, you'll stick yourself all over with the glory of it and walk
  off with someone else. That's about it&mdash;eh?'</p>

  <p>Irene stared into her cousin's dark face. She was so used to it she could
  scarcely have told what it was like. She found herself now looking as a
  stranger at a stranger. It was not a face to have near one alone and
  unprotected either with love in it or hate, not that any mood greatly changed
  it. To the girl it seemed now a much, much older face than she had thought
  it. It was lined, and heavily, about the eyes; there was grey in the black
  hair; the pallor of weariness under the swarthy skin&mdash;a handsome face, a
  face to attract-a woman, some women&mdash;not any girl.</p>

  <p>Irene felt fear. For all her coquetries, she had strongly the sense of
  maidenhood and its prerogatives-not as Daphne had it, but regarding it as a
  possession her own as her beauty was, at no man's bidding, her own free gift
  or unapproachable. She would not be chary of the gift very possibly should
  feeling prompt its bestowal, but, meanwhile, her untried confidence flattered
  itself she could defend it and manage a man in any mood. Behold, she knew
  nothing of men's moods. Ferriby bent a little closer.</p>

  <p>'Are you going to marry me?' he said. 'Steady, steady now,' as she gasped
  and made to rise; 'don't try any fuss. What did you think&mdash;that I was
  waiting here to read prayers with you? Don't make pretence. You're as cool as
  a cucumber. Why didn't you clear off upstairs while I was shutting the door?
  Not you; you thought about your supper and&mdash;' He put his arm round her
  shoulders, their eyes met, and he gave a slight laugh. He moved his head to
  kiss her.</p>

  <p>'Cousin John'&mdash;she pushed him away vehemently&mdash;'this is too bad
  of you.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, rubbish! Don't try that with me. Are you going to marry me?'</p>

  <p>'You haven't asked me.'</p>

  <p>She sprang suddenly from the chair, but she did not free herself. He
  caught her arm and rose beside her.</p>

  <p>'Well, I <i>do</i> ask you.' His voice dropped suddenly to a softer note.
  'You can't go on playing with fire. We'll put an end to it. Marry me before
  there's murder.'</p>

  <p>She looked at him, lovely as a dream vision, with widened eyes, her lips
  parted.</p>

  <p>'You'd turn any man's head,' he said, holding her spellbound with that
  look in his eyes, the note in his voice, not soft exactly, yet, for him, very
  soft&mdash;how did he do it? 'There's that lout Paul; it will be Gisberne
  next.' His breath quickened. 'I come first, eh? I can make you mistress
  here.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, you don't care about me,' murmured Irene, trying to laugh. She was
  frightened, she was fascinated. She felt the arm her cousin had slipped round
  her tremble. Devil Ferriby&mdash;it trembled! The strong fingers caught her
  about, held her, spreading beneath her heart.</p>

  <p>'You don't care about me,' she murmured again dizzily.</p>

  <p>'How do <i>you</i> know?'</p>

  <p>'You admire Mrs. Ibimay.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, rubbish! I&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Suddenly he crushed her up against him. She dashed her hands over her face
  and hunched her shoulders round her neck. 'This isn't fair,' she
  panted&mdash;' this isn't fair!'</p>

  <p>As suddenly he let her go. He turned to the bureau and began to shut
  drawers and gather papers together. Irene fell back against the chair. She
  felt put out into the dark, a door shut that she must instantly beat upon
  again to have thrown open.</p>

  <p>'Want to finish your supper?' said Ferriby presently, in his ordinary
  tone, picking up the glass dish.</p>

  <p>She took it from him, went with it into the kitchen-in the dark. She
  didn't know it was dark; she directed herself unconsciously, unerringly. She
  came back noiselessly, and found Cousin John fastening the casements.</p>

  <p>'Cousin John,' she breathed. He didn't heed her. There was plenty of time
  for her to slip across and gain the stairway. She didn't want to. She wanted
  him to speak to her, to come near to her again. 'Cousin John!'</p>

  <p>He stepped from the dais. 'You'd better be off to bed, hadn't you?' he
  said.</p>

  <p>Irene's heart leapt as if it would break from her body. A savagery seized
  her. She hated Ferriby; she hated him.</p>

  <p>'Good-night,' he said coolly.</p>

  <p>Unsteadily she moved to the door and put her hand up to the latch. He made
  no sound, and she rested her face against her arm. It was a struggle. To go
  away now would be to give herself an advantage of dignity, to withdraw a
  firebrand, to put one man at least safely the other side of a rift, easily
  widened into a breach, and a breach between herself and Devil Ferriby would
  cool brewing hate and stave off tragedy. But she could not do it. She hated
  the man who had stripped her own nature bare to her, who made plain to her
  how little she could do save yield to this. She hated him, but she
  turned.</p>

  <p>He was looking towards her from the bureau.</p>

  <p>'What is the matter?' he said, and came leisurely towards her.</p>

  <p>'Why are you so cross?' she whispered, trembling.</p>

  <p>'Cross! You little fraud!' He laughed unsteadily. 'Now listen: I'm not
  going to be trifled with. You don't work me up like this to-night and then
  start to-morrow opening your eyes at me: "Cousin John, whatever do you mean?"
  You're going to marry me?'</p>

  <p>'Oh no, no, no!' she said, leaning back, head upthrown, a hand still on
  the latch.</p>

  <p>'Don't talk like an idiot,' said Ferriby, words unloverlike, but breathing
  strong passion, and that was the life of her, the love of her&mdash;oh, he
  made it plain. 'You know you are, you little witch...You, you...Come, you
  must go to bed. I'll talk to you in the morning. Be off. I...I...confound
  you!' He opened the door. When she had mounted a couple of steps, suddenly he
  put his hand out, detaining her. They could barely see each other in the
  gloom.</p>

  <p>'Good-night...'</p>

  <p>'Good-night...Cousin John...'</p>

  <p>'Ah...'</p>

  <p>A smothered cry from her. But he drew her back against his shoulder; her
  lips yielded to his in a long, mad kiss.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Irene Garth was sitting by her chamber window when the dawn
of the next
  morning broke. But summer dark is short. It was only three o'clock when the
  chirping and singing of the birds roused her jarringly. She had been crying
  violently, for her face showed still stained. After parting from Ferriby she
  had fled and broken into her room, sobbing tearlessly, her hand held to her
  throat to stifle herself. In quick, breathless movements she lit the lamp and
  began to undress. She tumbled her hair about her shoulders. She flung off
  skirt and bodice, then, catching sight of herself in the glass, cowered away
  before her own image, rallying herself the next instant passionately. She had
  done nothing wrong. Cousin John had asked her to marry him&mdash;he had
  kissed her&mdash;what was that?...Everything was the same: she would undress,
  go to bed, sleep&mdash;everything was the same...Suddenly she was weeping,
  weeping madly, wildly. She struggled with hysteria successfully; she would
  not have roused Daphne Estorel and brought her to her side for much, but she
  could not restrain her tears. She sobbed herself sick and dizzy, throwing
  herself face downward on the old square Chesterfield, smothering sound in a
  pillow dragged from her bed. She hated Ferriby. He had branded her with the
  mark of her own nature, and the touch hurt her; it blemished her. She hated
  him. What was her beauty to be worth to her? In this moment's acute
  revelation she could see the end of it. Day-dreaming had never been much in
  Irene Garth's way, but the formless glow of it had coloured the days, hiding
  nameless hopes. She felt, she saw now that glow go out, vanish, and leave her
  in a place where dreaming did not come. Ferriby had kissed her; he had said
  no word of love. Irene hated the man who made plain that love and kisses were
  two things. She wept to have the knowledge. The vague horizon of womanhood,
  with its dim outlines of the ideal, had always been for her a formless,
  ungraspable thing of the clouds; all the same, cloud-like it had brooded over
  her mind, softening and hiding realities of character, equalizing her with
  Daphne, with everyone.</p>

  <p>Ferriby's kiss had scattered cloudland. She wept to stand unshrouded; wept
  at a loss as if her hair had been cut away, or her dimpled shoulders seared
  and puckered by fire. But she would not weep too long, she would not weep
  again. It pierced her heart awhile to understand herself all in a moment and
  so violently. Responsive, not to the man but to the mood, with no strength in
  herself, passion leaping to passion, whither would she be tossed&mdash;where
  her guiding star, what her safeguard? None. She wept to have it made so
  plain. But gradually the smart lessened. She sobbed herself into inertia and
  lay supine, barely conscious, till the twitter of the swallows told her the
  night had gone. And as the dawn brightened and the light spread, Irene began
  to mock herself. She could scarcely piece together what she had been weeping
  for. Cousin John had startled her, and coming as it did on those few moments
  with Mr. Gisberne&mdash;as the recollection touched her Irene lay back along
  the couch. She was half-clothed, and shivered in the cool morning breeze, but
  she was too spent just yet to move. She closed her swollen lids and recalled
  timorously, and yet in flashes, through her heart how Robert Gisberne had
  moved and turned his head, and what he had said and how he had said it, and
  the way he took the bridle as he sprang into the saddle. He <i>had</i> parted
  with her alone at the end of the lane, minutes after the Ibimays had walked
  away; and with the pleasure she had found in him still about her she had gone
  in and yielded to Ferriby's arms, submitted to his kiss&mdash;submitted,
  returned it...as she would return any kiss so given. And there was Paul.
  Slowly Irene rose. There was Paul. Thought of him jarred at first as did the
  birds and the return of brightness in the light.</p>

  <p>Then she began to handle it with a revival of self esteem. Paul at least
  loved her. The great, fine, senseless fellow who had hired himself out as
  little better than a labourer in order to be near her, and yet at the same
  time not eat the bread of charity from the hand of the man he hated&mdash;and
  for her sake too the hatred, mind you&mdash;surely he loved her. Yes, thought
  the girl, his were colours she could flaunt as proudly as any maiden ever did
  a stainless knight's. Paul was young and proud and virginal. Irene caught her
  breath to think of Cousin John's lips on hers, of his betrothal kiss. She
  hated him. She smote herself suddenly upon the breast, hating him; a rageful
  gust shook her, and then again her face hardened. Feebly she made ready to
  lie down and try to sleep&mdash;feebly, for she was worn out with tears and
  waking, and her soft body could bear little strain, but all grace of emotion
  had gone by. She hardened herself against her own folly to have minded
  so.</p>

  <p>As for marrying Cousin John? Had he meant that? She would marry nobody as
  yet&mdash;perhaps not ever. She shuddered a little as she sank down into the
  cold, lavender-haunted sheets.</p>

  <p>How should she dare marry when one man who might be drawn by her beauty
  was the same to her as another drawn by it! She turned her face to her pillow
  to keep her swollen eyes away from the light, although it streamed in softly
  through the pale green curtains like sunshine through a wave.</p>

  <p>Still, Paul loved her. She would keep that love a white possession. He
  should always love her&mdash;doglike, humbly, adoringly, touching the hem of
  her gown in the sight of others. And for the rest&mdash;she was as she was
  made. As for Cousin John&mdash;her thoughts, wandering on the borderland of
  sleep, dropped away from him, yet lingered round that vivid 'good-night'
  kiss, his image changing and confusing itself with another&mdash;with Robert
  Gisberne. Would he so kiss&mdash;'</p>

  <p>A few hours later Sophy knocked on Miss 'Rene's door with her early cup of
  tea, and, as was her wont, waited for no answer. She stared, on entering, to
  see the curtains drawn and Miss 'Rene's clothes tumbled so about the room.
  Such beautiful clothes! such an air about them! Sophy stepped to the bedside.
  This visit to Irene's chamber in the morning was an excitement to the Cockney
  girl similar to those stolen doses of a penny novelette over her mouthful of
  food in the cheap restaurant in the Harrow Road.</p>

  <p>Irene lay dishevelled in a deep sleep. 'Lord, ain't she lovely I' thought
  Sophy, gazing. 'It gets over me why she don't go to Lunnun an' marry a Nearl.
  Fancy her a-drivin' along! She'd make 'em sit up.'</p>

  <p>Irene stirred and opened her eyes. Sophy gave a little cry. She couldn't
  help it. She had cried out just like that when, walking with Scarside one
  Sunday in spring, two big violets had all in a minute stared up at her from
  the hedgerow.</p>

  <p>'Whatever is the matter, Sophy?'</p>

  <p>'I can't help it, miss. Your eyes&mdash;you a-openin' them like that. You
  must excuse me, miss, but you are that lovely&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'You've brought my tea.' Irene sat up thrilled with the warmth of sleep
  and&mdash;dreams. The sun was shining brilliantly with a sense of heat behind
  the seagreen drapery. Irene smiled to herself slowly. Had she really lain
  upon the couch last night and wept! One of her pillows had fallen from it to
  the floor, and was there to prove it. Wept! Why? <i>Wept</i>!...She
  remembered now and smiled, dropping her eyelids over the memory in her eyes
  while Sophy stared at her.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-5"
     id="ch-1-5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">Devil Ferriby was not kept awake by his little scene with
Irene. As he
  undressed he quoted to himself her remark about Dora Ibimay, with an
  ejaculation at the ways of women. His estimate of his lovely cousin was in no
  way disturbed or altered. Ferriby was incapable of single-mindedness towards
  a woman. He summed Irene up in the same terms he had ever used with
  any&mdash;Mrs. Ibimay excepted; but that lady, and his standing towards her,
  Ferriby had not so far treated to any summing up at all.</p>

  <p>Irene was too lovely to be let go&mdash;that was the essence of the
  situation, and an easy thing to sleep on.</p>

  <p>When he rose the next morning Ferriby debated with himself marriage with
  her. Jane Skidfell would hate the notion, might make difficulties over it.
  Dora Ibimay might make difficulties. Not likely; she might. Paul&mdash;ah!
  that reminded him. He had not forgotten Mistress Skidfell's instructions last
  night, but he had not found it a right moment to bother with them. However,
  if he married Irene, Paul would have to clear out. Ferriby decided it would
  be interesting to put to Irene Jane's proposal to hoodwink Paul into starting
  for the other ends of the earth, and see how she took it. He imagined she
  would fall in with it readily&mdash;enjoy the hoodwinking, play it to the
  life.</p>

  <p>Descending to the 'lavender-room,' Ferriby found Daphne Estorel ready to
  attend to his breakfast.</p>

  <p>It was Petsham market-day, and Ferriby entered gaitered and spurred for
  the seven miles ride, spruce and smart as he always was, a flower, just
  picked, in his buttonhole.</p>

  <p>He could ride to Petsham with all the hay abroad, a change in the weather
  ahead, and a 'catch' reported from Droitlet, with remarkable ease and scant
  overseership, for he left Paul looking after things.</p>

  <p>Paul wasn't paid to be manager, but, working shoulder to shoulder with the
  others, he managed them none the less. He would be a loss, and there was
  another year of their silly agreement still to run. However, Jane's warning
  was&mdash;a warning.</p>

  <p>'I suppose it's no use hoping to see Irene,' said Ferriby, who was down
  late himself, and stood drinking his coffee.</p>

  <p>Sophy came in with hot cakes. The glass door into the old pleasaunce stood
  wide open, the shadows of the bushes were already strong, the roses wide.
  There were roses on the breakfast table, and Daphne behind the urn, bright
  and quiet, dressed in pink print, and wearing flowers&mdash;only flowers
  seemed no coquetry in Daphne Estorel.</p>

  <p>'Miss 'Rene's just a-comin', sir,' said Sophy. She admired the master. A
  fine sort, she thought him. The set of his riding-breeches, the swagger of
  gaiters and spurs&mdash;lor! it was scrumptious. Ferriby Grange was better
  than the play to Sophy Bassett.</p>

  <p>'You're making no breakfast,' said Daphne.</p>

  <p>'Oh yes; the coffee's enough. I'm late.' Ferriby's manner to Daphne was
  good. His speech, too, and ways with her the best show of himself he made;
  and Daphne's voice, bright like herself, curiously cordial, seemed to express
  an exceptional attitude towards Devil Ferriby.</p>

  <p>There was always a quiet between them, a tacit recognition of something
  that, uniting them, yet kept them apart.</p>

  <p>'Is there anything I can do for you in Petsham today?' he said, setting
  down his cup.</p>

  <p>'No, thanks&mdash;nothing I could trouble you with.'</p>

  <p>'When are you going to ride again? Pity to give it up. Let me get you a
  fresh mount,' he added. 'I saw the very fellow of Irene's
  chestnut&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'What are you saying about Irene?' said Irene's voice at the door, and
  Ferriby looked up sharply to see the dazzling vision of her. She showed no
  trace of last night's emotions save a touch of pallor and some heaviness of
  her white lids. She was as fresh as the morning&mdash;fresh even as
  Daphne&mdash;in serge skirt and cotton blouse, cool and easy as could be; but
  Ferriby could guess her heart-beat by his own. He knew she was down early to
  see him.</p>

  <p>'Hello!' he said. 'Wonderful for you to put in an appearance. I rather
  wanted to speak to you&mdash;about that bit of Droitlet beach,' he added
  after a barely perceptible pause. 'Dorrey tells me you want a bathing tent
  there. But '&mdash;he looked at the time&mdash;' I can't stop...Come with me
  round to the mounting-block. Good-morning, Daphne.'</p>

  <p>Ferriby was used to Irene's scant courtesy towards Daphne, of Daphne's
  unmoved disregard of it. It was one of the acceptances of the household, of a
  piece with Paul's taking of his meals alone, with Daphne's calling an old
  servant aunt.</p>

  <p>Ferriby did not even notice that Irene did not so much as glance towards
  the golden-crowned figure at the head of the table. He wanted to get her out
  of the room and to have her to himself again a moment. Their eyes met a brief
  second.</p>

  <p>'Go and get your gloves and whip,' said Irene, looking swiftly
  away.&mdash;'I'm coming.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">'Well?' said Ferriby, looking down at her.</p>

  <p>'Well?' Irene tried to give him glance for glance. Her eyes fell.</p>

  <p>'We're in for it, eh?' He slipped his hand through her arm.</p>

  <p>'I don't know what you mean, Cousin John.'</p>

  <p>'I knew that would come,' he laughed, squeezing her arm to his
  side.&mdash;' We'll get married this summer&mdash;as soon as you
  like&mdash;the sooner the better.'</p>

  <p>Irene came to a stand. They had passed out of the front entrance, little
  enough used now, the quadrangle of outbuildings to their left, the
  lavender-room to the right, but not overlooking. A flagged path led down to
  iron gates between stone supports.</p>

  <p>'I don't believe you care enough about me,' said the girl.</p>

  <p>'I'm thirty,' Ferriby spoke shortly. 'You're the only girl I've ever
  offered to marry.'</p>

  <p>'And you mean it. Cousin John?'</p>

  <p>He looked at her. 'Don't you?'</p>

  <p>The colour flamed into her face. 'We're cousins,' she said, with something
  of defiance.</p>

  <p>'That doesn't help us,' he answered, looking at her. 'And I fancy you'll
  be as safe with me as any man. You always did need a strong hand over you.
  Now, look here, I can't stop. I'll see you again this evening. But '&mdash;he
  laid his hand upon her shoulder&mdash;' I want you to think over something
  meanwhile. You know that mark on Paul's sulky face, eh?'</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes. 'You were a brute!' she said.</p>

  <p>'Yes, I am a bit of a brute.' His tone was expressive, and she looked away
  sharply. 'You've not suffered much by it. Paul's different. There's no room
  for him here. I'm sorry. He has his uses, but you've got to get rid of
  him.'</p>

  <p>'I?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, my little beauty&mdash;you. We don't want murder.'</p>

  <p>'Are you afraid of him?' she asked, with a lift of her chin.</p>

  <p>'Jolly well afraid of him! <i>You</i> don't think it would matter.' He
  swayed her lightly to and fro. 'That mark on his precious face was put there
  because of you. You had got into my blood even then, and into his, though my
  young cock-of-the-walk didn't know it. Now it wouldn't stop at&mdash;marks.
  I'll not have Paul hanging round, sulky, after we're married. He won't go for
  me. It's your business.'</p>

  <p>'To tell him I am going to marry you?'</p>

  <p>'You <i>can</i> play the innocent, Irene! Tell him you're going to marry
  <i>me</i>! You'd better not. He might stick a hay-fork into you. You keep
  quiet about our marriage. I'll tackle Jane. Tell Paul what you like. You
  don't need my coaching...'</p>

  <p>He was studying her face as he spoke, wondering if she would even pretend
  to indignation, noting her beauty, feeling his pulses quicken at it not a
  whit the less that she did not.</p>

  <p>'I'm to ask him to go for my sake?' Her lovely eyes were languorous under
  the heavy lids, perfectly serene.</p>

  <p>'Exactly. Over in Australia, or some such place, he'll forget you fast
  enough. I don't want to kill him. It would be a pity he should kill me, eh,
  wouldn't it?' He gave a glance towards the house-front, and put his arm round
  her. 'You don't want me killed just yet, do you? Not just yet? What shall I
  bring you from Petsham?'</p>

  <p>Irene smiled, as she always would at personalities, at petting, let what
  would have been said before it.</p>

  <p>'Well, if you're talking of buying Miss Estorel a mount...' she
  pouted.</p>

  <p>'Leave Miss Estorel alone! It was the excitement of knowing you were
  coming. You little witch! Look here, I shall lose all the best men...I must
  be off. Give me a kiss.'</p>

  <p>'No, Cousin John, no...'</p>

  <p>'Nonsense!' She yielded as she would always yield. 'Come with me to the
  mounting-block,' he whispered loath to lose the contact of her.</p>

  <p>'I can't&mdash;no, I can't. Scarside will be there. Do go, John.' Even as
  she spoke she flung her arms round his neck; he uttered a quick, caressing
  sound and strained her an instant to him. The next, without looking back, he
  clanged the gate open, and strode down the road.</p>

  <p>Irene went very slowly back to the lavender-room. She had had no
  breakfast. She wanted some. The table was partially cleared. Daphne, her back
  to it, seated at an escritoire, bent over some accounts. Irene, unheeding
  her, touched the bell, and Sophy brought in fresh coffee, hot scones, a
  fillet of plaice, cool strawberries and cream. A meal at Ferriby was a
  matter, winter or summer, and Irene had no notion of supporting beauty on a
  wafer. But as little eating as sleeping could she do aught amiss. She had
  beauty.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Daphne looked round, and Irene at that instant looking towards
  her, their eyes met.</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Irene, her tone as near to insolence as she dared make it.
  Daphne always held her in check.</p>

  <p>'I was thinking&mdash;' Not to Irene Garth would Daphne betray how she had
  had to nerve herself during the minutes of the other's luxurious repast to
  this calm tone of the disinterested onlooker. 'Is it not a pity,' she began
  again, 'to let things come to extremes between your cousins?'</p>

  <p>'What do you mean?' Irene's favourite expression.</p>

  <p>'There might be bloodshed.' It was superfluous to explain more nearly.</p>

  <p>'Can I help it?'</p>

  <p>'Do you want it?'</p>

  <p>'Absurd. I don't believe in it.'</p>

  <p>Daphne rose. 'Then you never notice now the mark on your Cousin Paul's
  face?' She spoke lightly&mdash;a horrible tightening round the heart told
  her, alone, the effort of it&mdash;and went from the room with the careless
  bearing of one who has discharged an indifferent duty.</p>

  <p>Irene went on eating strawberries...But Daphne, calculating on an effect,
  had achieved it. Irene had thought last night, seeing Paul and Daphne
  together in the east porch, that possibly Daphne cared for Paul; then she had
  been thrown off the scent and annoyed, on entering the room later, to hear
  Daphne laugh-rare thing&mdash;and find she was alone with Robert Gisberne;
  and now she spoke of the Ferriby affairs with seemingly genuine indifference.
  Irene was again at sea about her, and Daphne's cool hint had the more effect.
  Ferriby desired Paul out of the way&mdash;sheer masculine dislike. Jane
  Skidfell desired it because of enmity to her, Irene, and dislike of quarrels
  in the house she served; therefore their talk of bloodshed was prejudice, and
  weighed for nothing against Irene's whims. Daphne's disdainful warning had
  force, because of its disdain. Bloodshed, bloodshed! The mark upon Paul's
  face...With a sudden start Irene remembered the paper he had written over
  with his blood. She had it still, bestowed carefully among her trophies. It
  had been shown and laughed over here and there, among girls at school...That
  paper&mdash;Irene put down a strawberry unfinished, and leant back to
  shudder. It was a recall of her disgust at sight&mdash;six years ago&mdash;of
  that dark, oozing line down Paul's cheek, dripping in full, dragging globes
  on to his collar. For a breath the sunny room danced, black and flecked,
  before her eyes; she also foresaw disaster, felt it touch her. Yes, Paul had
  better go...Then she steadied herself, the roses came back into shape and
  colour. She saw the big strawberry on her plate, white and red, showing the
  marks of her pretty teeth. She finished it, and dipped her finger-tips in the
  china bowl. Paul should not go.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-6"
     id="ch-1-6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">Characteristically, Irene did not press Cousin John to
announce an
  engagement between them. It equally suited Devil Ferriby to behave to her as
  he had always done, in and with a manner that obviously expressed her
  attraction for him, yet could always cloak itself behind their relationship.
  He would marry Irene, but he had no intention of inviting chaff or
  congratulations, and he preferred his caresses stolen.</p>

  <p>Jane Skidfell was told. She received the news in a grim silence.</p>

  <p>'I suppose you won't set yourself against it? My wife will be&mdash;my
  wife,' said Ferriby. 'You won't let it make any difference?'</p>

  <p>'You're the master's son,' answered the old woman.</p>

  <p>'Aye, but you were in the master's confidence,' returned Ferriby with
  meaning. 'I understand all that, though I may not all the confidence. Any
  marriage of mine has got to consider you.'</p>

  <p>Jane Skidfell raised her keen, if withered, eyes, dimmed at this
  moment.</p>

  <p>There was no good in Devil Ferriby, his heart hard as the nether millstone
  to God and judgment. There were wenches who cursed him, there were widows and
  fatherless who called him an oppressor. The traditions of an ancient race
  were nothing to him; he scoffed at his inheritance. But the old servant,
  gazing into the dark face, saw only 't' master and t' master's son.' She
  stretched out her toil-worn, finely-shaped hand with an almost maternal
  gesture of entreaty&mdash;not to him, to some Power who might ward off evil,
  who might forbear judgment; and Ferriby, so accustomed to it that he never
  saw it, perceived somehow all at once that thin gold ring upon the bent
  marriage finger. It gave him a momentary, strange sensation.</p>

  <p>'Irene will behave herself when she's married to me,' he said, and his
  tone conveyed deference and a touch of the affection of life-long use.</p>

  <p>'Oh, go thy ways,' answered Jane. 'I shall say naught.'</p>

  <p>She did not believe this marriage would take place. No hint of its
  fulfilment came to her in her long abstractions&mdash;no hint of any
  marriage, only continual, vague warning of disaster.</p>

  <p>'And what of Paul?' she asked, as John turned away.</p>

  <p>'Irene will manage him.' Ferriby laughed with perfect appreciation of
  Irene's capabilities. 'He's keeping himself to himself these days; scents
  something out, perhaps. I'm asking Gisberne if he can suggest something in
  America that he could put into the fellow's head.'</p>

  <p>'Is that t' wench's notion&mdash;Irene Garth's?'</p>

  <p>Ferriby took the grim scorn in Jane's tone with utter unconcern. He rated
  Irene pretty much at her actual value&mdash;for him at any rate. He asked for
  no fine qualities in women, for all he might scoff at the absence of them.
  Moral disparagement, up to a point, rather whetted his passion.</p>

  <p>'We're acting on your advice,' he said. 'Biblical, isn't it? Doing evil
  that good may come; deceiving that precious lout to save him from doing for
  me or&mdash;it might be that I did for him. Either way unpleasant, and just a
  nice finish, eh, to the Ferriby record?'</p>

  <p>The scoff fell unheeded; even the announcement that John Ferriby would
  marry his cousin sharply, even before the corn was carried, passed Jane
  Skidfell by, arousing little attention.</p>

  <p>She did not believe it; it would not overtake disaster: disaster would be
  here first. Bloodshed, bloodshed! The old house seemed to whisper the word;
  it fell like a red shadow over the page of the Bible as she read, and yet
  Jane Skidfell took no more initiative than her once-or-twice speech with
  Ferriby.</p>

  <p>By some infatuation she would do no more. It seemed decreed that she
  should point to Irene Garth, then silently stand aside and let the event rest
  with her.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Subsequent to the invitation that had given Robert Gisberne
the freedom of
  a friend at Ferriby, Paul had kept closely to himself.</p>

  <p>Daphne had a sense of joy restored to her by his non-appearance that
  evening even after Irene's bidding; she debated whether, urged by her words,
  he was making up his mind to leave Ferriby and Irene, or whether he brooded
  some definite claim of passion.</p>

  <p>Paul had gone his way all the years, taking his meals apart and finding
  his own solacement on Sabbaths and holidays. How he contrived to meet and
  talk with Irene privately she knew better than he; his intercourse with
  Daphne had ever been indefinable and subtle. Now, however, Irene could not
  come across him; he had altered ways and habits. Daphne, watching for him,
  knew when he sat in solitary fashion over his meals, brooding, slouching; but
  then she did not care to intrude. For the rest, the fields knew him, not the
  house. Daphne never entered his room.</p>

  <p>And this fell at the middle of July. 'Well be married before the end of
  August,' said Ferriby to Irene. 'Say the twentieth: that gives you five
  weeks. I shall chance the corn. Not much about this year; and, for the Lord's
  sake, don't make flummery. Get what you want afterwards. I'll take you to
  London. We might go on to Paris; I've never seen it...Five weeks is a long
  time to wait, eh?'</p>

  <p>'Five weeks is no time at all in which to get rid of Paul,' said Irene.
  Ferriby had an arm about her shoulder; over the other was slung the bridle of
  his horse, that followed sedately with light, curvetting movements, throwing
  round the lovers' meeting the air of grace and romance that goes with the
  equestrian. It was early morning. Ahead of them along the road were Droitlet
  and the sea. John was bound thither, and lately it had become Irene's custom
  to rise early and stroll with her cousin and lover on the way his day's ride
  took him. The voluptuary in her liked the freshness of it: John's immaculate
  linen, the morning's opened flower in his coat, the touch of him, cool,
  clean-shaven, the steadiness of his manner. At night his manner was not
  always steady, his cheek not cool, his love-making rough. They were upon a
  lonely bit of road, the dew not yet dry upon the grass.</p>

  <p>'What's the matter with the young fool now?' said Ferriby. 'Do you think
  he knows what's up?'</p>

  <p>'I don't think he'll go,' said Irene.</p>

  <p>'The deuce, won't he? Not go! We'll see about that. You haven't put it to
  him yet?'</p>

  <p>'No. How could I? I never see him. It seems to me I'm always with you.
  Cousin John.' She lifted her flower-like eyes, but drooped them again
  instantly on encountering his look.</p>

  <p>'Not <i>quite</i> always,' he said. He stopped. 'Keep still, you brute,'
  he said to his horse. 'Stand off, will you!' He drew Irene to him.&mdash;'
  Divinely tall,' he had to stoop his head a very little way to meet her eyes.
  They kissed. 'I say, we're getting pretty fond of one another, eh?'</p>

  <p>She leant against him, and he said something too low for even the soft
  summer air to mischief with. 'I don't believe you used to be quite sure you
  liked me,' he resumed. She held him silently. 'Get rid of that young fool,'
  he went on. 'I opened the ball with Gisberne the other day about prospects in
  America, but the fellow's so sparing of his words. You tackle him. Look here,
  with you between us it's not safe, and that's flat.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps, after all, he wouldn't mind,' suggested Irene meaninglessly,
  tentatively.</p>

  <p>'Mind what? My marrying you?' Ferriby laughed. 'About as much as I should
  mind it in him, and that's to the extent of knocking the life out of him.
  D&mdash;&mdash;d whelp! I've always hated him.' Her face was resting against
  his. He turned his head and kissed her throat.</p>

  <p>'You speak to Gisberne,' he said, preparing to mount, 'and bribe that
  confounded interloper with a millionaire's business somewhere Chicago
  way...Steady now&mdash;steady.'</p>

  <p>Horse and man showed each other off. The creature, with softly flashing
  eye and dancing feet, seemed in its own beauty to resent Irene's presence,
  and yet, in its nature, to completely understand it, and, unlike man's
  comprehension, with no judgment mingled.</p>

  <p>Ferriby swung into the saddle, stooped almost as instantly, and Irene,
  tiptoeing, received his lips upon hers in an instant's swift, maddening
  intensity.</p>

  <p>Then the horse sprang forward, prancing, curving, and Ferriby touched him
  into a hand-gallop without a backward look.</p>

  <p>So their meetings always ended&mdash;on the throb of quickened desire left
  to electrify the blood through the hours of separation.</p>

  <p>Irene understood Ferriby's method, though the pain of her first
  comprehension and its resentment had never returned to trouble her again.
  There was neither tenderness nor respect between her and Cousin John, no
  mutual hopes or fears, no stretching future on which to build; but Devil
  Ferriby's love-making had introduced an element into the days Irene could not
  forgo.</p>

  <p>How far the man was making himself one with the passion he gave and took
  Irene would not let herself consider. She was going to marry him, without
  love, romance, or self-deception. The 'afterwards' they would have to face as
  they faced what they were doing now.</p>

  <p>And concerning Paul, he whom, she claimed to herself, loved her. The first
  impulse to keep him had lost strength with the sense of maiden loss that
  prompted it. Her momentary idea that Daphne was interested had left her. Paul
  kept away from her, and seemed not to care to observe how much she was with
  Cousin John. Thus, spurs to counteraction lacking, Irene, languid with
  'stolen caresses,' half made up her mind to act straightforwardly, as it
  seemed to her, considering the double deceit she had been
  contemplating-namely, to pretend to Cousin John she was asking Paul to go; to
  pretend to Paul she cared for him alone. She <i>would</i> let Paul go,
  persuade him to it, urge it upon him as for her sake.</p>

  <p>This humour reached, Irene became more anxious to put it to the test with
  Paul than she had been to bid him stay. She would speak to him this evening
  without fail. She strolled on, almost burdened with the excitement of the
  senses, clothed in the knowledge of her own beauty that awoke them for her.
  The upper air was full of the sound of larks. The breeze stirred the pulses
  like a draught of wine, fragrant and rich as the honey of wild flowers. Irene
  kept her thoughts to the present hours, and sang as she walked along.</p>

  <p>A bend in the road discovered to her a pony-carriage advancing rapidly.
  Beside the driver, attired in a countrified man-servant's dress, sat, as if
  she were fatigued already, even at this hour of the day, a lady&mdash;Dora
  Ibimay.</p>

  <p>The Ibimays had been tenants of Fulbec Farm for a year. Not that Theodore
  Ibimay farmed. No land for farming went with the house, though the name of
  the old standing abode. In an isolated belt of trees, swept over by the wind
  from the sea, Fulbec hunched itself, an ugly whitewashed building at the foot
  of a shoulder of moorland sloping down a mile to Droitlet beach. And in the
  sweep between was a creek, showing for a space unutterably, unexpectedly,
  like an inland meadow stream. Theodore Ibimay had come here in the hope of
  finding air to suit him. He had tried many climates&mdash;a consumptive with
  a fair income, patient, incredulous of death, uninteresting. He seemed to
  think Fulbec agreed with him, and Dora, his wife, strenuously supported this
  view. She was wearied beyond words of wandering; it did her husband no
  good.</p>

  <p>The Ibimays were of the few on visiting terms at Ferriby Grange. Irene,
  away in the South the greater part of the winter, had only had a month or so
  to make Mrs. Ibimay's acquaintance. She had been introduced to her by 'Cousin
  John,' and at the moment Irene had received an impression. Her own stress of
  feeling and John's change from petting to passion kept this impression in the
  background and blurred it. Irene rather liked Dora Ibimay, much the older,
  older than Devil Ferriby&mdash;thirty-five, no doubt, and a direct contrast
  to herself; thin to fragility, dark to sallowness, with weary, pleading eyes,
  and a wide, full-lipped, tragic mouth.</p>

  <p>Dora Ibimay was always cold. She had lived in India, Ceylon, the Brazils,
  dragged about aboard and ashore in the South Seas. On this English summer
  morning she was wrapped in a fur.</p>

  <p>'How is Mr. Ibimay?' said Irene, as they met and shook hands over the
  splashboard.</p>

  <p>'Oh, he's not very well. I've been to the Grange for cream and some of
  your butter. Mr. Ferriby is very kind about it. Theodore will touch no
  other.'</p>

  <p>'To the Grange! How did I miss you?'</p>

  <p>'I never thought of asking for you,' said Dora. 'That you should be up so
  betimes!'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I walked some of the way with Cousin John. He has gone to Droitlet.
  You are sure to see him.'</p>

  <p>Irene was not altogether sorry to feel the involuntary colour rise as she
  spoke. She had neither intention nor desire to speak of her engagement. She
  found no derogation in its furtiveness, but she had no objection to allow
  this woman to note in her cheeks a flush at Ferriby's name and draw
  conclusions.</p>

  <p>'He may call,' said Dora. 'He generally does. Are you going away this
  summer?'</p>

  <p>Irene laughed consciously. 'I don't know. I'm lazy-minded, I think. I
  enjoy the moment. I can't understand what it can be to make plans.'</p>

  <p>Mrs. Ibimay glanced at her sharply; then, with a little shuddering
  movement, declared she must not stop, but must get home quickly.</p>

  <p>Irene stood idly aside and watched the pony-cart out of sight. Mrs. Ibimay
  did not look back. 'I wonder if her husband's illness wearies her, if she
  ever wishes it was over,' thought Irene. 'Did Dora care for her husband?' she
  thought. 'Did <i>she</i> care for Cousin John?' came an instant sequence like
  a flash. 'Did she? Yes, no, yes, no...did she?' She had made a distinction in
  her own mind between Cousin John and Cousin Paul. Paul <i>loved</i> her, she
  had said. But, after all, was there any difference in men, or in women, or in
  love? Her reflections rebounded to her contemplated interview with the one
  she had decided 'loved her,' and she grew eager for it.</p>

  <p>Returning to the Grange by the east porch&mdash;not blocked up
  yet&mdash;Irene found by the little carriage clock set on her bookshelf that
  it was barely ten. She called Sophy, and asked if the breakfast had been
  cleared away.</p>

  <p>'Yes, Miss 'Rene. Miss Daphne wanted the table; but I've kep' some 'ot,
  miss. I'll bring it in a jiffy.'</p>

  <p>Irene smiled indulgently. Quick in everything personal, she noticed in
  Sophy a growing adoration, and (weaving the web of destiny unwittingly)
  encouraged it.</p>

  <p>'It's against orders, Sophy,' she said. 'Dare we?'</p>

  <p>'I'd dare a lot for you, Miss 'Rene'&mdash;the girl spoke almost with
  passion&mdash;' an' I'm not the only one, neither. Oh, an', miss, Mrs. Ibimay
  was here. I told her you an' Mr. John had gone together. She's a queer sort,
  ain't she, miss?'</p>

  <p>Irene neither reproved nor resented the freedom of speech, never by any
  chance shown before Daphne Estorel.</p>

  <p>She wrote a few lines, enclosed and addressed them to Paul, and bade
  Sophy, with hint of a lace blouse that might be hers, undertake faithfully to
  see that Mr. Paul had the message, either carried to him in the rick-field or
  handed to him should he come in to a meal.</p>

  <p>In the note she asked him to meet her that evening in the old harness-room
  beyond the big barn, where they had trysted often in the days Jane Skidfell
  had tyrannized over&mdash;the days before the mark was on Paul's face, the
  first days of their coming to Ferriby, boy and girl.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-7"
     id="ch-1-7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">'May I come in?' said Gisberne's voice. It was winning to
late afternoon.
  The heat had been by many degrees less than for days past. Wisps of white
  mares' tails, looking as if they would merely shroud a woman's face, drawn
  across the blue, were enough to make it a hard background, and obscure the
  sunshine, and a little wind blew in baby gusts. Yet Irene lay back languidly,
  as if exhausted, in her chair upon the dais. The piano was shut&mdash;no
  books about her, or needlework, at which, strangely, perhaps, she excelled,
  rivalling, when she chose. Daphne Estorel. Gisberne had arrived unseen. He
  knocked on the inner door that stood ajar, the burnished latch down. Irene
  did not move.</p>

  <p>'Is that you, Mr. Gisberne?'</p>

  <p>He entered, other answer superfluous. After Devil Ferriby and Paul,
  Gisberne appeared slight, though in reality not of mean build, lithe and
  muscular. He came forward smiling, pleasant, detached, hat in hand, and sat
  down in silence. Irene studied him a moment. Every impression connected with
  that first little scene with Ferriby had been blurred by little scenes with
  him subsequent. She no longer, recalling them, slipped Gisberne into
  Ferriby's place. His attraction for her assumed the nature of a watchfulness
  of him. No more than Ferriby was she fanciful about him, but her feminine
  mind worked at him unconsciously as the fingers of someone busy talking will
  fumble at a knot. It was remarkable he should be so pleasant and so-nothing
  else. He hid something.</p>

  <p>'Have you had tea?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Thank you, Miss Garth. I take tea if it's there. I wouldn't have anyone
  get it for me.'</p>

  <p>Irene did not add to what had been a mere form of greeting.</p>

  <p>'You don't seem bright,' said Gisberne.</p>

  <p>'I am tired.' (He smiled.) 'You don't know the feeling, I suppose?' she
  added.</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'I've been thinking.' (His glance met hers pleasantly, silently.) 'Are you
  going to say you don't know what <i>that</i> is, Mr. Gisberne?'</p>

  <p>'I wasn't going to <i>say</i> so.'</p>

  <p>'But you never think.'</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't like to make an assertion. What <i>is</i> it?'</p>

  <p>'Thinking?'</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Oh, you're teasing...Have you seen Cousin John to-day?'</p>

  <p>'I called this afternoon on Mr. and Mrs. Ibimay. I found Ferriby there; I
  left him there.'</p>

  <p>Irene moved a little. It did not disturb her that John should visit the
  Ibimays. It affected her to restlessness to see someone in her presence and
  seemingly so unaffected by it. The other evening Gisberne had bent his eyes
  upon her much as men always did-or so she imagined. Not so to-day.</p>

  <p>'I have been thinking about my cousins,' she said, sitting forward and
  taking her chin in her palm. 'You know my cousin Paul. Don't you think he
  would do well in America? Couldn't you help him to a start there? Mr. Ferriby
  has already mentioned it to you, hasn't he?'</p>

  <p>'He has&mdash;yes.' Gisberne gave her a good-tempered glance.</p>

  <p>'We Ferribys seem to have no friends anywhere,' said Irene; 'only just
  ourselves, and the Grange, and a mile or two round. And it's too
  small&mdash;too small. Mr. Gisberne, do help me to get Paul away! You must
  know crowds of people. I am afraid&mdash;yes, afraid! There will be trouble
  if he stays here.' She rose with a charming gesture of agitation. 'Oh, you
  must have seen it for yourself. I can't bear that there should be any trouble
  about me.' It was a chance for a little theatrical effect. It came so
  naturally to Irene she could scarcely be blamed for using it.</p>

  <p>'I'll have a talk with Mr. Paul,' said Gisberne pleasantly, but with no
  more than that for show of sympathy. 'I <i>might</i> put something in his
  way.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, but please,' she cried, 'don't say a word to <i>Paul</i>&mdash;at any
  rate, not yet. That would spoil everything. It must come from me. Mr.
  Gisberne, you surely have noticed. Don't you remember the evening you came
  here to tea&mdash;the two of them, when we rode up...You've noticed the scar
  on Paul's face?'</p>

  <p>Gisberne nodded.</p>

  <p>'That's the mark of John's whip, when we first came here, years ago, Paul
  and I. I was between them; I am between them now. I can't bear to see Paul in
  the position he is in here. It is for my sake. And Cousin John&mdash;' She
  broke off. 'They are both my cousins. I am fond of them. It would kill me if
  anything happened. I am going to try and persuade Paul to go away. But where?
  What is he to do? Oh, if you can, help me?'</p>

  <p>She turned to him, the tears in her lovely eyes, her bewitching mouth
  trembling, her attitude most naturally and charmingly that of being forced
  into this&mdash;carried out of herself.</p>

  <p>Gisberne seemed to consider a moment or two, fingering his panama. Irene
  remaining standing, her eyes fixed upon him, he rose.</p>

  <p>'<i>You</i> ought not to be here,' he said.</p>

  <p>'What do you mean?' She had brought him to the personal note as she had
  meant, and more directly than she had expected. Her tone changed.</p>

  <p>'I've travelled up and down the States,' said Gisberne, keeping his eyes
  on her, 'and a little bit in Europe. I never met anyone with more than your
  looks. Miss Garth.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, please,' she assumed a nervous laugh.</p>

  <p>'It is so. There is a world out yonder. You stay here.'</p>

  <p>'Mr. Gisberne,' she protested, 'I am just back from school.'</p>

  <p>The glance of his ordinary hazel eyes went through her little subterfuges
  with their pleasant good-tempered look. Irene perceived, it flashed through
  her in the way of such communications, that she had his attention&mdash;yes,
  the note was certainly personal&mdash;but she had <i>not</i> his interest or
  his belief. She was piqued.</p>

  <p>'You don't understand me,' she said, turning away. 'I am sorry I
  spoke.'</p>

  <p>'You needn't be. Say anything you like to me, any time.'</p>

  <p>Ah, here again in him was the touch she had felt and responded to that
  night she had sped back in the light excitement of it to find&mdash;and
  yield&mdash;to Cousin John. She looked round at him swiftly.</p>

  <p>No thinking beings refuse to believe in sensations that have as little
  connection with feeling as with the desire to put them into words; no one
  reading this story will refuse to credit that Gisberne and Irene, looking at
  one another, foreboded suddenly the end of it. As the sensation came, so it
  went. 'Say anything you like to me, any time.' These were the words that had
  struck out the electric flash that touched like lightning the distance
  waiting for them, like lightning was gone.</p>

  <p>Irene turned away, her vanity half persuaded Gisberne was more interested
  than his manner showed. He himself was unconscious of expressing more than a
  temper that nothing could disturb or shock.</p>

  <p>'I'll consider what you've told me. Miss Garth,' he said. 'I've no doubt I
  can give you a letter to one or two in the States if you tell me your cousin
  means to go. Now,' he made a motion towards the piano, 'will you play
  awhile?'</p>

  <p>She shook her head. 'Play to me.'</p>

  <p>He shook his head and produced a cigarette-case. 'May I smoke?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, and so will I.' He handed the case with his pleasant air and unmoved
  face. As the light wreaths of smoke rose between them, Gisberne fell into his
  usual silence, and Irene did not try to break it. He smoked sitting forward,
  his elbows resting on his knees. Irene lay far back and sent the wreaths
  slowly and languidly before her, her hand moving in indolence in keeping with
  her relaxed form. They would have appeared to an onlooker in the unreserve of
  intimacy, but since Gisberne did not think at all, it could not be now of
  her. And she was not thinking of Gisberne. There was Paul to be met within
  the hour. Thought of his passion had lain on Irene's heart a couple of
  summers as lightly as a rose-leaf; it weighed on her anticipations now,
  slightly burdensome. She found herself listening for the sound of hoofs; like
  a child hungry for its mother, she began to turn to Cousin John's
  return...But he would not be back for hours yet; it would be night,
  moonlight, her interview with Paul over, before she would be in his arms
  again.</p>

  <p>The sunshine faded completely from the light, with drowsy chirp of bird
  and sudden perfume from evening flowers.</p>

  <p>'We are having supper early,' said Irene, rousing herself. 'Cousin John
  won't be home till late. I don't know what is the matter with me to-day; I
  was in the sea too long yesterday, I think. I am going to ask Miss Estorel to
  make some coffee. Come with me; she can't say "no" before you.'</p>

  <p>Gisberne made no comment. He accepted the invitation to remain to the
  evening meal as tacitly as it was given. He followed Irene, pleasant,
  self-contained. The girl moved along before him, breathing sex and beauty,
  palpitating with life. Gisberne, aware of it, was quite unmoved...</p>

  <p>Once, years ago, he had sat on the stoop of a saloon shanty outside a
  mining camp and read between a flare of gas and the moonlight out of a
  tatterdemalion book&mdash;read of a woman with pale gold hair. His pockets
  were empty at the time. Inside the shutter, men were gambling and staking
  money&mdash;golden. Gold in the gas-flare; money; gold out here in the
  tattered romance in a page lit by the moon; a woman's hair; he with pockets
  empty. Here was the connecting link that had brought the scene back as
  Gisberne followed to the lavender-room. His pockets were empty; he must get
  Ferriby or someone to the cards. He saw gold on a table! Daphne Estorel had
  golden hair.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-8"
     id="ch-1-8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">'There is a world out yonder.' Little can we judge, when
conversing with
  one another, which of our words will stick, or what phrase make the
  impression. 'There is a world out yonder.' Gisberne had used the words in
  their talk just now, and over and over Irene said them as she went that
  evening to her tryst with Paul. 'There is a world out yonder.' She felt no
  desire towards it. Dora Ibimay, who knew it, spoke with no affection of it.
  Contrasting it with the lot of most of her mates at school, Irene knew hers,
  spite of early threatenings, to be fortunately cast. Like Circe with an
  island for her kingdom and the turning of shipwrecked sailors into brutes for
  her sport, Irene was content with Ferriby Grange and to play with the
  passions of the men it found for her. She, with her great beauty, was of the
  god-endowed, and sense of it sufficed.</p>

  <p>Gisborne's words had little meaning, but she went over them again and
  again: 'There is a world out yonder.' It became a refrain, ominous, not
  alluring.</p>

  <p>She passed through the rickyard, deserted and hushed by the moonlight into
  strange repose. Tarpaulins, ladders, and farm-gear assumed that remove of
  themselves and unfamiliarity that comes at once to objects of daily usage
  when man has gone and night has come. As she went by the stables, Scarside
  came out of a door swinging an unlit lantern&mdash;not the Scarside of six
  years ago: the son, brawny, and bearded, and young.</p>

  <p>'I am looking for Mr. Paul, Solomon,' she said.</p>

  <p>'I haven't seen un, miss, not for an hour past.'</p>

  <p>She smiled. 'It did not matter.' It did not, indeed. Paul would come. She
  went on to wait for him.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Any child that has ever known such a place as the old
harness-room at
  Ferriby has a heritage of remembrances and a storehouse of associations worth
  all the fairy-tales in the world.</p>

  <p>Outside its great door was a slab newly sanded every day; either side of
  the doorpost was a rounded stone, and in the crevice between the stones and
  the wall grew snapdragons&mdash;yellow ones, with mouths opening to be fed at
  a pinch of the finger. Within the place a raftered roof rose into such black
  secrets as the cave of Ali Baba never knew. Lower down, over the beams that
  crossed where the whitewash stopped, spiders weaved and old bits of harness
  hung, telling tales of ghosts, not human, and more fearful far. The
  atmosphere was like nothing in ordinary spaces, a wonderful smell in it, a
  warmth and cleanliness, a savour of the earth, and yet not the earth that
  belongs to human beings&mdash;earth of gnomes and pixies, of talking beasts.
  In the old harness-room was sense of golden afternoons, of stolen security
  with apples in the pocket, a book under the eyes, of youth, of childhood, and
  the long, long hours when their golden sands streamed through hands wide
  open&mdash;wide, wide open to let them go the faster. On the floor of such
  places as the old harness-room some of the grains are still scattered, and
  one here and there may be picked up and held a perilous moment of exquisite
  pain.</p>

  <p>Against one wall stood stacks of beans, onions, potatoes&mdash;not for
  eating&mdash;set apart for some wordless destiny, for which faces and tufts
  like hair and eyes and little twisted bodies seemed to mark them. At the far
  end hay was tossed as if it were worth nothing, but woe to the one who
  dragged wisps of it into the yard. There were horse-blankets waiting repair,
  gardening tools and empty flower-pots, faggots and turf, and, high up on the
  inaccessible window-sill, certain round and suggestive dark balls, about
  which the ghastly legend ran they were of hair, and had once been in the
  stomachs of calves.</p>

  <p>As Irene pushed the door open she glanced up and saw them there still,
  like little black heads. She remembered how she had screamed when she first
  was told what they were&mdash;screamed and wept in fastidious disgust; and
  Paul, to please her, had mounted to remove them, and been caught by Scarside,
  who snatched the ladder away, bore it off, and left him hanging up there by
  his finger-tips. He had barked his leg dreadfully as he scrambled down,
  declared his ankle was broken, and jolly well upbraided her for days
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>Ah! gradually and insensibly those upbraidings had ceased; gradually,
  insensibly the light in Paul's eyes changed, and the clear brightness of his
  face. After that day in the buttery, even as the mark of Devil Ferriby's
  whip-lash died away into a scar, so did Paul's boyhood die into a young man's
  passion, scarring his life as the line of the whip did his face.</p>

  <p>The holidays came when he refused Irene's kiss; his hands, spread with
  work and roughened, trembled and avoided her touch. She had coaxed and driven
  him into speech, made him pretty vows, said she would marry him when the time
  came, and (amazing!) he had sold himself into slavery for her sake, and was
  waiting, and believed in her. Well, she would persuade him now to go, and let
  it all end happily.</p>

  <p>As this resolution renewed itself, Irene felt a glow of self-commendation,
  an idea that, after all, she misjudged herself. Cousin John would be the one
  she must marry, and she would be quite content with him. The harness-room was
  in such black shadow, the moonlight so ghostly where it broke through the
  door and the one high window, that Irene would not go in. Her superstitious
  fears were never far. It was so still she fancied she could hear the tide
  three miles away. She walked slowly to and fro. No window overlooked the
  spot. One of its joys in the past was its seclusion, a place where Jane
  Skidfell ceased from troubling, and old Scarside left them in peace.</p>

  <p>Not long was it before Irene heard Paul's tread. With the first start
  through her of the coming footfall she suddenly felt unequal to her task.
  Suppose Paul turned on her. '<i>Bloodshed, Do you never notice the mark on
  Paul's face?</i>' Suppose Paul thought of murder&mdash;yes, but in connection
  with <i>her</i>! The sensation&mdash;it did not amount to more&mdash;was gone
  as Paul rounded the building and, seeing her before him in the moonlight,
  stopped silently.</p>

  <p>'Paul!' She was glad to see him. She hated to be alone. She moved quickly
  towards him. He was dressed in what he owned in the way of complementary
  dressing&mdash;cheap blue serge vest and jacket, square-cut. His gaiters and
  stout boots were second nature to him. His neck had round it only the low
  collar of a flannel shirt, grey, a black tie loosely knotted under it. He was
  bareheaded. A fine spaniel came at his heels with a soft furtiveness, very
  far from sure she ought to be there.</p>

  <p>'Well,' he said, 'you are really here.' His tone checked the girl. She
  scanned his unsmiling face.</p>

  <p>'Did you think I shouldn't come?' she said. She laid her hand on his arm.
  'I have been wanting to speak to you for days. Fancy, Paul, my having to
  <i>write</i> to you! What have you been doing?'</p>

  <p>'Keeping out of your way.'</p>

  <p>'Why, what have I done?'</p>

  <p>Irene was well equipped. She had not only her beauty. She took up her cues
  instantly, responsive to every phase of a man's prompting. She looked at Paul
  now gravely, with an unshaken front, no hint of coquetry. He stepped away
  from her, looked away from her, and leant against the wall beside the open
  door of the harness-room.</p>

  <p>'I've had enough of it,' he said, in his sullen way.</p>

  <p>'What do you mean?'</p>

  <p>'You may marry Devil Ferriby or anybody you please,' said Paul, with a
  rough laugh. 'I am going away.'</p>

  <p>Irene started. Of all things she had not expected this. She had come to
  <i>ask</i> him to go away. She had indifferently resolved he might as well go
  as not, that one cousin was enough. She had not allowed for this-to lose Paul
  like this. She was taken aback, and showed it.</p>

  <p>'Is this something Daphne Estorel has put into your head?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Very likely.'</p>

  <p>'You let her talk to you about me?'</p>

  <p>'I don't talk to her or to anyone about you or anything. But <i>she's
  there</i>. I don't think she would be the sort to let a fellow she cared for
  drop below his level and make of him a convenience and a butt&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'You're unjust. It's your own silly temper,' she broke in, but gently,
  very gently, the tone of her reproof silky as a caress. 'Why, don't you
  remember that evening when we saw you in the porch, and I begged you to join
  us at tea and assert yourself, take your place&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Yes, to show off before Gisberne and Daphne. It was that settled me. I
  had some idea you did care for me. I trusted you, but it's rot...I'm a fool,
  and I've broken the back of it. I am the son of a gentleman, and I've been
  through a public school among gentlemen. No woman is worth this sort of
  thing. You're not. I am going to take myself off to Canada, and you'll have a
  clear field. I'm going to-morrow week, and that's why I came to-night.
  There'll be no need of any further bother about "good-bye."'</p>

  <p>Irene felt as if the earth had opened and the whole Grange had vanished,
  leaving a blank through which she must fall headlong. Paul was part of life,
  of everything, even of her stolen interviews with Devil Ferriby. For a long
  moment she could only look at him, saying nothing.</p>

  <p>'Good-bye to me,' she said at last. 'You can't really be meaning that?'
  Keenly observing him, she saw that his attitude did not change. He still
  leant against the wall looking away from her. There was no movement to
  express even an assumed indifference and ease. He held himself so tensely
  that the spaniel had settled to snooze at his side. His hands were crossed on
  his back against the wall behind him.</p>

  <p>Wisdom had come to Irene Garth with Devil Ferriby's kiss. She had boasted
  to herself that Paul loved her, and this was the way love showed
  itself&mdash;in sulks and absences. For all his steadfast worship of her,
  Paul was still a boy. Temptation whispered to her. He should not go. She
  could not lose him. Daphne Estorel's saintly influence should not be stronger
  than her touch.</p>

  <p>'You've startled me very much,' she said, and her voice was
  broken.&mdash;'Where can we sit down?...Come inside. I'm so tired, somehow,
  to-day.'</p>

  <p>She passed in, not waiting to see if he followed, and seated herself on
  one of the stoutly-filled sacks facing the door. She could not see him where
  she sat...Would he go away&mdash;leave her? Was this a resolution or only a
  mood? If he came and sat beside her now he would not go from Ferriby. She
  held her breath...Ah! he was coming. The spaniel ran in, frisking, and Irene
  held out to it a suddenly friendly hand. Yes, Paul's big figure blocked the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>'There's room here,' she said. 'How we used to love this place when we
  first came, didn't we? That was why I asked you to come here to-night. I
  thought you would understand...' She paused. He looked before him
  sullenly.</p>

  <p>'It's no use,' he muttered. 'You care nothing about me...'</p>

  <p>'And just to-night I wanted to tell you how much I <i>do</i> care...' He
  glanced at her sharply. 'I've missed you so much,' she said. 'It has been
  misery never to see you, to speak to you. The whole place has changed.'</p>

  <p>He made a sound of incredulity. 'It's Ferriby you care for.'</p>

  <p>They were quite plain to one another in the moonlight&mdash;she beautiful
  as some dream of Paradise, he a young man, god-like in strength, who had been
  drawn to her for long in virgin adoration and desire.</p>

  <p>'I care for you,' said Irene, and she looked a moment into his eyes.</p>

  <p>She was not wholly false in so far as she was true to herself. She cared
  for all beauty and strength in manhood, and, where it offered itself, she
  must make it hers. Paul was splendid, and that he should flout her, get
  better of her, go away, and perhaps one day fold those stalwart arms of his
  round Daphne Estorel and press on her lips his own first wholly awakened ones
  was out of the question. She was not wholly false when she laid an arm about
  his neck and drew near enough to rest her cheek against his shoulder. To her
  this was neither John nor Paul. She wooed the man&mdash;man, strong,
  dominating, too much for her, her master, and yet who trembled at her
  touch.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Ferriby was not so late home that night that he did not
expect Irene to be
  somewhere in waiting for him. He stabled his horse himself&mdash;for he hated
  his incomings hampered, and would have no one hang round for him-and then
  went back to the house by way of the east porch. Far from having that
  entrance blocked up, he found it suited him. In the shadow of the entry his
  arms would find Irene. They would part at the foot of the stairway as they
  had parted that first night, and the open bureau and the candle set among
  account-books gave him any excuses ever needed for being in the living-room
  late or early. To-night Irene was not in the entry. There was no sound of
  her, no sign of her in the room. But she had heard him enter the house,
  holding in her breath by her window above. She did not dare to face him. She
  was dizzy still from her parting with Paul. She was for once afraid.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-9"
     id="ch-1-9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">Young Solomon Scarside thought Sophy Bassett the queerest
thing in woman's
  shape he'd ever clapped his eyes on. He had appeared for a snack and a drink
  midway through this mighty fine July morning, and Sophy came out to him in
  the bright cobbled yard and watched him handling his&mdash;'thumb' of bread
  and cheese, a quart jug, blue and white, standing on the bench against the
  door, with the row of shining pails end up upon it.</p>

  <p>'Now then,' she said, turning up her shrewd little Cockney face, 'ain't
  you never going to be done?'</p>

  <p>'What's thy haste, lass?' demanded Scarside.</p>

  <p>Sophy perked up her nose at the giant's chin almost a couple of feet above
  her. 'A'hm in a hurry, ma lad,' she said, with laborious imitation of his
  accent.</p>

  <p>'What speech does 'ee call that, naw?' Scarside stuffed in a mouthful with
  keen enjoyment of her.</p>

  <p>'Gibberish hi call it!' said Sophy, smartly going back to her own
  vernacular. 'As I wrote to my young man, 'owever they hunderstands each
  bother parses me.'</p>

  <p>'I don't believe in that young man o' yourn,' said Scarside.</p>

  <p>'Lord, no!' Sophy briskly retied her apron. 'Yer ain't got the brains to
  take him in.' She sighed. ''E's a good sort, his my young man.'</p>

  <p>Scarside gazed on her reflectively. '<i>His</i> he, now? Wat's he doing
  down in Lunnon, then, and you up here?'</p>

  <p>'Go on wi' yer, yer sawny!' cried Sophy. 'Dahn in Lunnon the men have
  smaller stumicks and littler 'eads, but there's more in 'em.'</p>

  <p>'In theer stumicks?'</p>

  <p>'Naw, in theer 'eads.'</p>

  <p>Scarside shook his with slow decision. 'Yorksheer's hard to beat.'</p>

  <p>'My young man'd beat the lot of ye,' retorted Sophy, waxing eager.&mdash;'
  What'U ye bet me? Sharp? Sharp as a needle&mdash;up to heverythink as you can
  know.'</p>

  <p>'What is t' lad?' asked Scarside, unbelieving, but condescending to a
  lofty curiosity.</p>

  <p>'Lad? He's one-and-twenty and next to the boss in the biggist greengrocery
  business in the 'Arrer Road.'</p>

  <p>'What size is he?'</p>

  <p>'Same as me, an' abaht as broad,' returned Sophy proudly.</p>

  <p>Scarside reverted to scepticism in a loud guffaw. 'Any hair on his
  face?'</p>

  <p>'Naw, he ain't then. He's no bloomin' monkey. "Sophy," sez 'e to me, an'
  'e give me a sort of clutch...' She lost herself a moment in tender
  recollections, smoothing her apron, her head on one side.</p>

  <p>'What's a clutch?' asked Scarside. 'Onyways like this?' He gripped her
  waist.</p>

  <p>Sophy fought him off indignantly. 'Leave orf! He's no helefant. "Sophy,"
  says 'e to me, "there's a haunt o' mine dahn from the North, an' she knows of
  a place she can git yer. You go," says 'e, "an' get some flesh on yer bones,
  an' then we'll be married comfortable," says 'e...'</p>

  <p>Scarside exploded into Homeric laughter, bringing the wenches within up to
  the open door to look. And when they saw they waxed wroth. It was unfair to
  home product that this peaky scrap from 'Lunnon' should carry off a champion
  native; but it seemed as if Sophy Bassett would, though she scouted all
  suggestion of wanting Solomon Scarside&mdash;hadn't she a young man at
  home?</p>

  <p>'What are ye larfin' at, ye great silly?' she cried angrily. '"Sophy," sez
  'e, "ye'll go, won't yer, for my sake?" "Anythin' you asks me, Jim," sez I.
  An' then he clutches 'arder like, an' "Turn yer 'ead," he sez. I turns it...'
  She suited the action to the word, smiling in assumed rapture, and Scarside,
  not too slow to note the opportunity, caught her softly round, and gently
  brought her face against the middle of his waistcoat.</p>

  <p>'<i>That's</i> wheer <i>thy</i> young man's face had a-come,' he laughed
  uproariously, 'but this is wheer mine is.' And he was about to lift her
  bodily to the level of it&mdash;would have done, only she fought him like a
  little cat.</p>

  <p>'Yer great baby!' she flamed in a hot whisper, 'an' Miss Daphne just
  a-come into the kitchen! Now hev yer done, Solomon Scarside?' she cried
  aloud. 'I'm waiting for t' jug. You know Missis Skidfell won't have 'em stand
  around.'</p>

  <p>Solomon was always as sobered as astounded by Sophy's finessing. With no
  diminution of respect, but through having grown a little more prepared for
  it, he expressed his appreciation in a huge wink as he turned away. Sophy
  gave a glance over her shoulder, ran after him, and caught his arm. 'You're
  sure it was Mr. Paul you saw Miss 'Rene with last night?' she whispered.</p>

  <p>'Certain sure.' He stared at the anxiety in her sharp, pretty face. 'That
  be nothin'.'</p>

  <p>'No, I know; only don't you breathe it to a soul, Solomon.'</p>

  <p>'I've seen 'em together a good bit,' pursued Solomon, collecting memories,
  'evenings&mdash;nights, I mean&mdash;this last week like.'</p>

  <p>'Well, don't you let on about it, Solomon. Don't you speak of Miss 'Rene
  before Mr. John&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'She's a-carryin' on wi' 'em both,' said Scarside. He scratched his cheek,
  and added reflectively: 'She always have.'</p>

  <p>'You'll be careful, Solomon: say nothing, will you?'</p>

  <p>'You're fair set on the lass,' said Solomon. 'She'll get hersen into
  trouble.'</p>

  <p>Sophy's face whitened. 'That ain't no affair o' yours. If you say any
  think as makes mischief I'll never forgive you, so there.'</p>

  <p>Scarside grinned good-humouredly, and strode off. Sophy ran back into the
  house.</p>

  <p>Miss Daphne <i>was</i> in the kitchen. She glanced up at the girl as she
  entered, but said nothing. Sophy, her nerves a little strained, wished she
  would. She had remarked to her fellow-servants once or twice what a
  difference it would make did Miss Daphne speak out a bit more. She bustled
  into her work again, feeling guilty and conscious under Miss Daphne's
  heavenly blue eyes and in her still presence. There would be trouble at
  Ferriby. Miss 'Rene was going too far-and Sophy knew it. That morning Miss
  Irene had risen early and gone out with Master John. Sophy, at risk to
  herself, had taken to hanging round that fascinating bedroom when she went in
  with the early cup of tea. Only this morning Miss 'Rene had laughed in a
  scared fashion once or twice, and said she wished men weren't so silly and
  tiresome, and that it wasn't her fault; and she had asked the girl if she
  would come with her if she should ever want to leave the Grange, and then she
  gave her some wonderful gloves and a white veil, telling her to let no one
  see them. Now, on the other hand, Scarside, working it into a clumsy
  courtship, had mentioned to Sophy that Miss Irene met Mr. Paul these
  evenings, and went sweethearting with him on the sly. Sophy knew that Irene
  rose madly early and met John Ferriby long before he had need to ride away,
  and came back to her room with heightened colour, having made excuses not to
  walk with him openly from the farm. Very plain it was that Miss Irene didn't
  want Mr. John and Mr. Paul to come together and find her a third; and very
  plain it was to Sophy's sharp estimate of men and matters that that sort of
  thing couldn't go on long.</p>

  <p>The little Cockney servant had developed in herself an adoration for Miss
  'Rene. At this particular moment she felt mad with herself to think she
  should have wasted time 'gammoning' with Scarside about a young man 'as
  didn't exist,' instead of making him swear, the great sawny, he'd make no
  mischief. She felt uneasy under Miss Daphne's gaze, as if already an
  accomplice. It was all very well for Miss Daphne. She might be pretty her
  way, pretty as a tree or the stream in the meadow where the forget-me-nots
  grew, but she didn't set men by the ears. To bring men to a fighting-point
  about you seemed to Sophy Bassett, fed on the strong meat of Saturday nights
  in a coffee-shop in the Harrow Road and the <i>Police News</i> on Sunday, the
  last tribute. As great a glory enveloped the heroine of it as others see, in
  golden mist, round the figure of Helen of Troy. Should Sophy be called to
  stand by Miss 'Rene in any way, she was keenly ready. She racked her brain
  for devices set forth in the tales she had read to suit any possible
  emergency...</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The beautiful summer day told off the hours that morning on
the sundial in
  the old pleasaunce, and the shadow fell as lightly, fell just the same as on
  every other day&mdash;just the same. This feeling that comes to the heart,
  looking back on the time that preceded some great catastrophe, can never be
  trite even in statement, for it remains ever pungent and true. Just the same!
  'Why did not the hours tell me what was coming?' cries the heart. 'Why did no
  one warn me&mdash;nothing-neither wind nor tree nor flower&mdash;while there
  was yet time? Could not heaven have spoken, earth or air, and given me just
  five minutes in which to know and do&mdash;<i>five minutes</i> out of all
  those sunny ones that moved on through the inexorable hours, letting me
  alone, saying nothing, caring nothing? Is there no pity in the warmth of day
  that I should have been left possessed and blindfold to go on to the fatal
  moment when no minutes, days, hours&mdash;no time more could avail?'</p>

  <p>Daphne Estorel had hereafter cause for some such reflections. Now, sitting
  alone in the 'still-room,' she could see the dial and the creeping shadow,
  and reckoned time as she had done yesterday.</p>

  <p>Everyone, it seemed, was about his usual avocation. The great house
  communicated nothing of what its isolated members did; but Daphne knew that
  Paul was in the clover-field, that Jane Skidfell was in her room preparing
  for a visit to a relative in Petsham, and that Irene Garth was taking tea
  with the Ibimays.</p>

  <p>On the table before her lay a letter from one of her Devonshire friends,
  Sir William Evered; it was the initiative to an offer of marriage not
  unexpected by Daphne. Sir William was the other side of fifty, a great
  traveller. He had told Daphne long ago he coveted such as herself as a
  companion and transcriber. As she had done before, Daphne put the veiled
  proposal again aside still veiled, but she pondered over the world that lay
  behind it, deliberating its attractions. She knew very little of the world.
  There was Russia, where girls of her own age went to imprisonment and death
  for a Cause; there was the world of exploration where one wanders among big
  things like an insect in a garden, and yet, even as the hand with a yard
  measure, can find an intellect to compute the designs of God; there was the
  world of Art...Daphne rose and took a violin from a corner cupboard.
  Trembling and paling, she tuned it a moment, and with timid touch drew the
  bow, playing the melody from one of Beethoven's adagios. As always, the
  rapturous music opened up an endless, boundless vista; her spirit mounted on
  it, though produced by her own furtive fingers, and she felt as she had felt
  always, that she could make one with the glory and the hope and pain of the
  world's dreamers who can repeat their dream.</p>

  <p>But between her and all of it, what she was ignorant of and what she might
  desire, uprose the figure of Paul Ferriby. Daphne put back the violin and
  folded up Sir William's letter.</p>

  <p>The despair of that evening some three weeks ago, when Paul had stood
  beside her in the porch, numbed her anew. She, in common with other
  onlookers, saw how Paul had come back to his allegiance. Jane Skidfell had
  said nothing to her of John Ferriby's intention to marry his cousin, but an
  understanding of marriage was not needed to point to the inevitable issue.
  There was catastrophe ahead, and Daphne still remained under the spell of
  silence&mdash;the silent resistance, silent opposition, that from the first
  had been her only method. She would have given much to break it&mdash;to
  speak to Irene, to speak to Paul, to urge definite action upon Jane Skidfell.
  She could not. Paul was worth to her everything known and unknown, and she
  stood aside and watched and was silent, and the stage was set for a
  tragedy.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-10"
     id="ch-1-10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">At half-past six the evening of that same July day Sophy
Bassett announced
  to Miss Estorel that Mr. Gisberne was in the sitting-room and asking to see
  her. Daphne almost hailed the announcement. The oppression of storm was
  drawing near, and the bands about her soul, seeming almost to hold her lips,
  were growing intolerable. She went at once.</p>

  <p>Gisberne was pale, and appeared slightly disturbed. He seemed relieved at
  Daphne's entrance, and glad to see her.</p>

  <p>'You're alone,' he said. 'I've come to play for you, as I promised.'</p>

  <p>'How did you know I was alone?' asked Daphne, lighter-hearted in a moment
  at speech with him. He was merely a being who, very happily, didn't care
  about anything save to live and behave himself as might some nice,
  intelligent dog. This was the worst Daphne Estorel fancied about Robert
  Gisberne now.</p>

  <p>'Well, I happen to be aware that Miss Garth is at the Ibimays', and Mr.
  Ferriby is on his way to join them. I think I may reckon Mr. Paul is out and
  about. That leaves you to yourself, Miss Estorel.'</p>

  <p>'It's very good of you to trouble to keep your promise to me,' she said,
  smiling.</p>

  <p>'You've kept yours to me.'</p>

  <p>'About your improvising. Such a little thing.'</p>

  <p>'Little things are the only ones for me,' said Gisberne. She noticed his
  pallor. 'You're tired,' she remarked, woman-like. 'Have you walked from
  Droitlet?'</p>

  <p>'That's nothing.'</p>

  <p>'Riding is less.'</p>

  <p>'You need a horse.'</p>

  <p>'You have one.'</p>

  <p>'No. Sold.'</p>

  <p>Daphne glanced at him, startled and doubtful.</p>

  <p>'I've had a touch of bad luck,' said Gisberne, responding to it. 'Never
  mind that now, Miss Estorel. Let me do my tricks. I almost think they'll give
  you pleasure. May I have this cup?'</p>

  <p>And he took it from the shelf. She handed him a silver spoon at his
  request, and he began to play.</p>

  <p>It was wonderfully sweet, indefinable, fairy-like, the music he made with
  it. Daphne found herself listening with more than pleasure. She grew
  intensely interested. Steadily, almost mechanically, as if following a
  routine he knew by heart, and pleased not with what he did, but with the
  effect upon her, Gisberne went from one thing to another. He played on the
  casement most cleverly, without any touch of the ridiculous. It was like the
  raindrops in a distinct, unearthly melody.</p>

  <p>'How do you do it?' asked Daphne, her eyes softened and shining with the
  delight of simple marvel that makes childhood's joys so rapturous.</p>

  <p>He sat to the piano, and, as his fingers moved with their strange
  deftness. Daphne drew close, liking him.</p>

  <p>'Have you a fiddle?' asked Gisberne.</p>

  <p>'This is an entertainment,' cried Daphne, 'and enchantment. It ought to
  make you famous.'</p>

  <p>'Fame is burdensome,' he answered, with a little grimace&mdash;the first
  she had ever seen in him. 'That's why I trusted you. This is just between you
  and me. Let me have your fiddle, Miss Estorel.'</p>

  <p>She led him almost gleefully to the room she called her own.</p>

  <p>'You've been playing,' he said, as he took the instrument. She kindled
  towards him the more for the remark.</p>

  <p>'Yes, a moment or two&mdash;this afternoon. I am very much out of
  practice, and you'll find I haven't got it perfectly strung.'</p>

  <p>'That's no matter to me.' He smiled with the calm of exact
  self-appraisement. 'I'm no musician.'</p>

  <p>If no musician, what then? He <i>was</i> no musician, but what then? As on
  the piano, he played very softly, and with the same extraordinary power of
  suggesting something that meant more than it did mean, as the pleading in a
  dog's eyes seems as if it must ask more than a tit-bit, or for leave to
  follow on his master's heels.</p>

  <p>Gradually, as he went on, standing in the doorway, wide open on the great
  flag-stone laid between it and the grass, covered with the dropping petals of
  a monthly rose-tree. Daphne, seated opposite, felt a touch of
  self-consciousness so startling it sent the colour to her face. Her childlike
  joy in the marvel vanished. She perceived that Gisberne was wooing her,
  soliciting her personal notice, laying before her in this performance of his
  his one claim to recommendation.</p>

  <p>With the insistence with which analogy with some pleasant animal came into
  her mind in connection with Gisberne, Daphne thought instantly of some great,
  good-tempered creature, dog or horse, showing her how he could fetch, and
  carry, and obey, and swim, retrieve, safeguard, gallop,
  endure&mdash;everything save speak and comprehend. This was what he could
  do...What did she think of him?...Her heart was touched.</p>

  <p>'There!' said Gisberne, ceasing. 'I have been able to do that all my life,
  very little worse, and never any better. A curious thing, is it not?'</p>

  <p>'The most wonderful I have ever met,' said Daphne.</p>

  <p>'It's nothing.' Gisberne moved to put back the violin, taking as little
  notice of the beautiful Dutch cupboard, the inviting fittings of the room,
  and the chintz like a flower-painting by Huysmans, as he ever did of
  anything. 'It's just a trick,' he said; 'only most people learn their tricks.
  Mine was inborn. It's nothing.'</p>

  <p>'It's the very soul of you&mdash;all there is of soul in you,' thought
  Daphne, with a pang of quick sympathy, 'and <i>you've been showing it to
  me</i>.'</p>

  <p>For some reason&mdash;perhaps because after this she felt too alone with
  Gisberne in the isolated lavender-room&mdash;Daphne led the way back. It was
  now nearing eight o'clock, and growing dusk. On reaching Irene's room, Daphne
  did not ring for lights, knowing that Sophy had stolen to the fields, and
  that the two maids were out till nine. She lit the candles at the piano.
  Gisberne hung about a moment silently, then picked up hat and gloves.</p>

  <p>'Oh, but you'll stay to supper, of course, Mr. Gisberne?'</p>

  <p>'No, I guess not, thank you&mdash;Miss Estorel,' he added, hesitating a
  moment&mdash;this also new in him.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' she said, full of kindly feeling.</p>

  <p>He sat down slowly, dropping his hands between his knees, fingering his
  hat&mdash;a favourite attitude.</p>

  <p>'What's your mind in the matter?' he said at last, looking up at her with
  his pleasant eyes. 'Is it anything to <i>you</i> which of these two Ferribys
  kills the other?'</p>

  <p>A bolt from the blue. Fire springing in living flame between her and the
  speaker could not have startled Daphne more. A cry, a shriek swelled in her
  throat and stifled there, would not have stifled only for Gisberne's ordinary
  glance from such everyday eyes; his pleasant, commonplace manner steadied
  her. 'You mean,' she said, after a dizzy silence&mdash;'you mean,' and gazed
  at him.</p>

  <p>'I mean I'm leaving Droitlet. Yes, I get tired of a place pretty soon. Now
  Miss Garth talks of getting her Cousin Paul away for fear there should be
  trouble between him and her Cousin John. I beg your pardon. Miss Estorel, but
  Miss Garth doesn't weigh with me seriously. If it's any consequence to
  <i>you</i> to save trouble, that's a different matter. I think,' he went on,
  putting it forth as an indifferent statement, 'that it's Mr. Paul will get
  the upper hand if it comes to it, and he'll very likely make it ugly for
  himself. I feel as pretty sure about that as I am that a storm is brewing
  just this minute. Now, if it's anything to you that there <i>isn't</i> murder
  done, I'll strike in and do what I can to get Mr. Paul away with me to the
  States,' he corrected himself, 'or wherever it might be I make for. Only, if
  it's nothing to you&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Voices interrupted. Gisberne let them interrupt, rising at once 'ears
  pricked,' eyes set to listening, dropping what he had just been saying as if
  it had been a book or a neckerchief.</p>

  <p>Irene entered, a step behind her Dora Ibimay, behind them both John
  Ferriby. Mrs. Ibimay with a laughing exclamation sank at once into a seat,
  protesting against the thundery heaviness. Irene markedly pale, smiled at
  Gisberne, and, murmuring something indefinite, went at once from the room by
  the inner door on to the stairway.</p>

  <p>Ferriby took no notice of Gisberne, or, for that matter, of Daphne, beyond
  a rough general nod as he entered. Gisberne, in alert, pliant attitude, kept
  his eye on him half smiling.</p>

  <p>Before anything further could pass, the door from the kitchen quarters
  opened upon Jane Skidfell. The room had rapidly darkened, and in the
  confusing gleam from the candles at the piano Jane sought an instant to find
  Ferriby.</p>

  <p>'Is t' master there?' she said.</p>

  <p>He turned to her as if annoyed at the interruption or out of temper
  already.</p>

  <p>'Hast thee change about thee for a couple o' gold pieces, Mr. John?'
  Mistress Skidfell addressed him directly, taking no notice of the others; she
  was dressed in bonnet and shawl of superior make and fineness, and carried in
  her soberly gloved hands a small black bag, which she opened as she
  spoke.</p>

  <p>Ferriby made a feint of feeling in his pockets. 'I haven't a sixpence,' he
  said.</p>

  <p>'Then thee'lt look in t' bureau for it, please. I must ha' change an'
  quickly.'</p>

  <p>Daphne came down to Jane's side; Ferriby swung round impatiently and moved
  to obey as he always obeyed. Dora Ibimay and Gisberne looked on.</p>

  <p>The key of the bureau was one of a bunch Ferriby drew from a pocket
  jangling lightly. He let down the flap. The candle-light darted on to a
  little pile of money suddenly revealed, picked it out, gold and silver, and
  held it in a momentary startling shine. Ferriby removed a handful of silver,
  relocked the bureau and replaced the keys.</p>

  <p>'What is the matter?' he said to Jane. 'Where are you going?'</p>

  <p>Jane dropped the silver uncounted into her bag. 'I have told thee,' she
  said grimly: 'I'm going to Petsham.'</p>

  <p>'To-night?' struck in Daphne.</p>

  <p>'Aye, to-night, my dear. I've had word by t' post just now as Betty
  Hackett's man is ill; she's afraid to pass t' neet alone wi' t' sick, and t'
  nurse has failed her.'</p>

  <p>'How are you going?' asked Ferriby. 'Is Scarside driving you?'</p>

  <p>'Aye. He's due at Petsham five to-morrow morning. A few hours this side
  can mak' no differences.'</p>

  <p>She went from the room. Daphne with her, turning as she did so with very
  definite intimation to Robert Gisberne that she was returning as soon as
  Mistress Skidfell should have gone.</p>

  <p>This gave an excuse for a suspension of silence between the three
  remaining in the room. Gisberne could remain, as he did, obviously in
  attendance on Daphne's wish, leaning against the piano, his eyes on Ferriby
  as if for a signal. Ferriby, moving to Mrs. Ibimay's side, glanced through
  the window and hoped that Scarside would clear the storm.</p>

  <p>'It's driving up <i>from</i> Petsham, though,' he said.</p>

  <p>'And so over Droitlet,' cried Mrs. Ibimay, starting up. 'I must get back.
  The pony bolts at thunder.'</p>

  <p>'Stay the night here,' said Ferriby.</p>

  <p>'Impossible.' She laughed and gathered the invariable wraps about her.</p>

  <p>'Well, wait five minutes,' he returned. 'The storm is not due for another
  hour. Wait till Daphne comes back. We can't very well leave Mr. Gisberne
  alone.'</p>

  <p>And now Devil Ferriby faced his visitor squarely and gave him a look from
  head to heel...unmistakable accusation, deliberate contempt...</p>

  <p>Cards were invented to amuse a brain-sick king, and persons of any sick
  leisure may become perfect at them. Theodore Ibimay, the consumptive with a
  life of vacant hours, had amused himself for a week past playing the duffer
  with a man who, expert as he was, knew less than he did. Gisberne had not
  paid up his losses. Yesterday Ibimay had called him&mdash;'card-sharper' to
  his face. Gisberne was now aware he had called him so to Ferriby.</p>

  <p>For the time being, the day's occupations, and, at the present moment, the
  women kept the issue suspended. Gisberne, very quiet, slightly pale, could
  not know from Ferriby's look how much more he might be going to bring to bear
  upon the situation than Ibimay's sick cackle about cards. He made no
  movement. Dora touched Ferriby's arm. 'I really must go,' she said, seeing
  the opposite door was opening; and as Daphne came in she took the moment and
  sailed out into the entry as if she had not seen her, Ferriby behind her.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-11"
     id="ch-1-11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">It was now between eight and nine o'clock. Scarside and
Jane Skidfell had
  left the Grange behind them and were speeding along the Petsham road.</p>

  <p>Of this departure Irene knew nothing. Nor was she at her window at the
  right moment to see Devil Ferriby and Dora Ibimay leave the house
  together.</p>

  <p>Irene was in sudden and great fear. She had had an instance that afternoon
  of the readiness of Cousin John's passion to express itself in fury as
  strongly as in caresses. In Dora Ibimay's presence he had been rough with
  her. On the way home he had said a few words aside, commanding her that
  evening to the good-night interview between them that she had chosen lately
  to abandon, and giving her pretty plainly to understand he was aware of her
  new triflings with Paul.</p>

  <p>These 'triflings,' Irene acknowledged to herself, had slipped beyond her
  management. She was in the absolutely mad position of having promised herself
  alike to John Ferriby and to Paul&mdash;not with any childish utterances of
  petulance and coaxings, but with a woman's caress and bond.</p>

  <p>She had forgotten, ignored, that two lines converging steadily to one
  point must meet. As long as her falsity ran safely between them she had
  thought it was she managing to keep them apart. Now she saw them head
  together, inexorably, no power in her or in anyone to stay it, and she was
  afraid. She imagined Devil Ferriby killing her. She stood in the centre of
  her room holding her head. She was asking herself in an ecstasy of tearing,
  savage, stunned self-recrimination why she had been so mad that evening in
  the harness-room. Paul was actually going away, and she had actually lured
  him back, not to his own destruction-Irene Garth was no longer giving even
  transient thought to that&mdash;no, to her own. It would be upon her the
  horror would fall. When those two met across her falsity <i>she</i> would be
  hurt between them. She could picture, almost feel, Devil Ferriby killing
  her.</p>

  <p>She went to her glass and stared at herself. Self-pity shook her. She
  could not help being what she was, she could not help it that men
  overmastered her. Again destiny weighed on her like death, and she asked
  herself what her beauty was worth. She had been mad to come back to
  Ferriby&mdash;mad, mad, to come back to be killed by Cousin John,
  killed...or...Her fears and dismay were entirely for herself. Had she needed
  anything to make plain her true relationship to John Ferriby, it was given in
  this panic. She had clung to his passion, returned his ardour, found it
  suffice. But Paul had ardour. And having drawn it forth, she had found it as
  strong and of far finer quality, with a trust and an exaltation in it she
  could no more put aside when offered than she could refuse the sunshine on
  her face because she also turned it to the stars and moon.</p>

  <p>But, ah! this was not a case of abstract things, of sunshine and night!
  She was between two men, and she was afraid, amid elements that would meet
  without any concern for her.</p>

  <p>This evening, at ten o'clock, she was to see Paul in the lane bounding the
  near clover-field. He believed in her, the young lover, whom her personal
  contact stultified, seeing her stealing forth to renew her vows, the victim
  of a tyranny he must trust to her a while longer to find escape from.</p>

  <p>Evening after evening she told him, with his arms about her, she would go
  with him to Canada, only not yet&mdash;not just yet.</p>

  <p>Then, in the early mornings, she glanced into Ferriby's expressive eyes,
  and toyed with nervous fingers with the dew-sprinkled flower in his coat, and
  begged him to let them go away and be married somewhere where no one would
  know. Paul would <i>not</i> go from the farm, she said&mdash;she had tried
  him. And Gisberne was no help. And Ferriby looked into her eyes, laughed, and
  asked her, Paul or no Paul, if by this time she was not quite sure that she
  was going to marry <i>him</i>.</p>

  <p>Oh, she would have to marry him!...Irene paced softly to and fro, her hand
  pressing her bosom unconsciously, wishing Sophy by chance would come. In
  fact, she must come, or she must find her. She must get a message to Paul.
  She could not risk letting Cousin John, by not finding her waiting for him on
  his return, come in search to the fields.</p>

  <p>Yet she dared not meet Devil Ferriby alone. Again she went to the glass
  and stared at her image. Her pallor gave her intensity. In the dilation of
  her terror, her form showed its rounded beauty the more through the light
  summer gown. She noted her own loveliness, and chilled at it. If she met
  Devil Ferriby and trifled, he would kill her. If she met him to renew her
  caresses and her promises, he would make her confirm them by vows from which
  there would be no going back. Ah! his kisses had made her wise. He would make
  her his indeed.</p>

  <p>Quaking, she withdrew to the window-seat, and locked her hands upon her
  lap. A low sound of thunder made her glance out over the darkening scene. If
  a storm came up she could not keep the tryst with Paul. Yet would not that be
  best, to see Paul and run away with him, as she had said years ago?</p>

  <p>Or should she go away alone, take Sophy with her, go to Droitlet, and get
  Mr. Gisberne to help her escape?</p>

  <p>All unconsciously, the knowledge of Gisberne had been colouring Irene
  Garth's reflections. A man named Robert Gisberne, whom she knew, was there,
  down below, actually a flesh and blood being standing for the world outside.
  In her world of Ferriby, both from Paul and John, Irene had simply taken,
  giving nothing, asking nothing. Gisberne stood for another side of things,
  vague and untried, for that reason now to be considered. Gisberne seemed to
  be interested in her, in no way as were her cousins. In this moment of stress
  Irene did not conceal from herself the fact that her beauty had failed with
  him there; but if she appealed to him, if she threw herself upon his
  kindness, expecting nothing but what he would do for...for...Daphne Estorel,
  say, what then?</p>

  <p>Irene had had almost enough of passion. The thought of kindness was
  relief, and Gisberne had kind, dog-like eyes. How could she fly with Paul,
  and take neither clothes nor money? Besides, <i>would</i> he fly? Yet to stay
  and be forced over the brink by Devil Ferriby! The unsounded future, her
  youth, her first resentment at the loss of all illusion, with deadly fear and
  natural shrinking added, rose against it...</p>

  <p>No; she would get away to Droitlet...Had Gisberne gone? They were all very
  quiet down below...</p>

  <p>Irene stole to the head of the stairs and listened, but the latched door
  at the foot was stout and made of no ill-seasoned wood. To hear nothing was
  not to be satisfied the room was empty. She crept down softly, and as she
  poised her steps she noticed, with the curious inconsequence of such moments,
  that she was wearing her best shoes, in which her feet were exquisitely
  fitted. From lovely creeping feet to her tumbled hair, her womanhood, her
  beauty, suddenly flushed her, but with pain and fire. She lifted the latch
  and stepped down, holding the door open in her hand. Someone had blown out
  the candles. The room was empty.</p>

  <p>At the same instant Sophy came in opposite with a great show of bustle,
  stopping astonished to find this gloom and silence. Irene moved forward in
  her white dress, and Sophy gave a little shriek.</p>

  <p>'Lor', Miss 'Rene, you <i>did</i> give me a turn!' she cried. 'I thought I
  should be that late...an' no one 'ere. Where's Miss Daphne going to have
  supper, miss?'</p>

  <p>'Lay it here,' said Irene in a sudden impulse, as if in supper she might
  find some stay or barrier. 'Light the candles again, Sophy.'</p>

  <p>As the girl obeyed she told Miss 'Rene of Mistress Skidfell's absence,
  Scarside with her. Sophy had learnt that outside, and more than that she
  could not repeat of anybody's movements. She had hurried in from the fields,
  knowing she was late; and here were her two fellow-servants not back
  yet&mdash;it was past nine&mdash;and not a soul had she met outside or in,
  save the lad who had told of Mistress Skidfell and Mr. Paul...</p>

  <p>'Where <i>is</i> Mr. Paul?' broke in Irene, with a hurrying forward as if
  a thought had come to her.</p>

  <p>'He was going up to his new room in the coach house, Miss 'Rene.' Then
  Sophy suddenly ran between Irene and the door, anticipating the other's
  impulsive movement thither. 'Don't go, Miss 'Rene!' she cried in a stifled
  whisper. 'Don't you do it...it isn't safe...'</p>

  <p>Irene looked at her a moment, then she leaned forward and gave her a kiss
  upon the cheek&mdash;a touch with cold, nervous lips, but oh, so sweet, so
  sweet!...'I am frightened, Sophy,' she said, dropping all pretences. 'I must
  see Mr. Paul...No, no; don't stop me. It will save trouble. I don't know what
  is the matter: I am suddenly so dreadfully frightened...I must see Mr. Paul.
  Lay the supper <i>here</i>...don't forget...and then, if you can, go up to my
  room and get things together as if I were going away for a week...will you,
  can you...?'</p>

  <p>'Don't you go near Mr. Paul, Miss 'Rene,' cried Sophy, white with the
  contagion of Irene's panic, her knowing features sharpened.</p>

  <p>'There is no one about...' Irene put her aside, and hurried through the
  kitchens out into the yards and towards the coach-house. This was at
  half-past nine, the storm still lowering.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Dora Ibimay and John Ferriby had walked on together past
the turning into
  the lane, where the ponycart was waiting to convey her back to Fulbec. This
  was allowed to jog along behind, Dora having pleaded not to be left yet,
  alone, to the oppression of the storm with the fretfulness of her husband to
  await her. John Ferriby seldom said no to anything Dora suggested; he subdued
  his stride to her languid steps, and paced beside her on the roadside grass.
  They discussed her husband's discovery respecting Gisberne.</p>

  <p>'I made inquiries this morning by telegraph!' said Ferriby. 'I couldn't
  get at much that way, but there's no doubt the fellow's a common impostor. I
  don't know what his game is in a place like this, but he's tripped himself up
  like a fool.'</p>

  <p>'What are you going to do?'</p>

  <p>'His references are a fake: that's what I gather. His bank is in his
  pocket. A mere swindling adventurer who, perhaps, has an eye on the
  silver...'</p>

  <p>Ferriby laughed. 'It must have given him a queer turn to be bowled over by
  your husband.'</p>

  <p>'But what are you going to do?' she repeated. 'Give him the clean
  kick-out.'</p>

  <p>'You won't say anything to the police?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'That's not my trade,' said Ferriby, with his sullen glance. 'Informing
  doesn't run in the blood.'</p>

  <p>The woman laid her hand upon his arm impulsively, kindling, as people do
  always at the generous touch in human sentiment. Her eyes suddenly filled
  with tears. She knew Devil Ferriby's reputation for drink, gambling, light
  behaviour with women, and hard dealings with the poor. Many a harsh and
  uncharitable deed was to his score, and many an one ill-fitting his name and
  descent, but this contemptuous disdain of action in Gisberne's petty case put
  him in a moment on a new pedestal in Dora's eyes.</p>

  <p>How different from her husband's summoning to council about it and his
  peevish and vindictive threats! She glanced at the figure beside her. Those
  marks of time and experience that had repelled Irene Garth at Ferriby's first
  definite advance attracted the woman whose time had been still longer, and
  who also had had experiences. Moreover, this Devil Ferriby summed up in one
  all that her life lacked, while she, her side. knew she could widen his
  narrow sphere. They would have suited one another...they <i>did</i> suit one
  another.</p>

  <p>And he was going to marry this cousin of his, and degenerate and turn his
  back hopelessly on romance. And where was she&mdash;thirty-five, worn,
  world-wearied, cold to most and never yet beloved&mdash;to find again someone
  like this who was drawn to her, someone in his full strength and manhood?
  Where would she have hope of love again? She would not give it up; no, she
  would not&mdash;she would not.</p>

  <p>As has been said, Dora Ibimay's estimate of Devil Ferriby was her own and
  went by force of contrast. She liked him for everything he was that he should
  not have been&mdash;liked him, she knew now, beyond bearing. She had imagined
  he liked her, liked her well enough to let nothing more come between them
  than-her husband. But, no. He could not wait and meanwhile give and take a
  silent sympathy; he must have his vent and marry a worthless girl, paying, in
  a fit of man's mere lavishness, a price like that for youth and beauty for an
  hour.</p>

  <p>She could have held him, had she chosen, without either, so she
  passionately told herself. Instead, she had behaved herself. For this whole
  year, through all their growing intimacy she had been immaculate in word and
  look; and yet he knew, he knew&mdash;John Ferriby knew. Why should he marry
  Irene Garth and set up a new barrier between them? And when, at any hour, the
  one standing now might fall. Dora's heart, swelling within her ever since the
  little scene of Ferriby's anger with Irene, making plain the relationship
  between the cousins, came to breaking-point.</p>

  <p>Through all this woman's thinking life passive acceptance of circumstances
  had summed up for her law and religion and the whole of human duty; but there
  come moments when the fear and custom under which we breathe drop away, and
  life springs up to have for once a try to manage destiny. Such a moment came
  to Dora now.</p>

  <p>They had walked on at least half a mile beyond the lane in a silence, so
  little disagreeable to either, it itself expressed how much unconsciously
  they had advanced to intimacy.</p>

  <p>A low wind began suddenly to moan and fall, chilly from seawards, where
  sulphurous-hued clouds were shaping themselves funnel-fashion.</p>

  <p>'You had better get home,' said Ferriby, stopping to glance round, 'or
  drive back. There's going to be the deuce of a storm.'</p>

  <p>And he motioned to the driver to whip up the pony. But Dora hung
  back.&mdash;' Your shepherd's cottage is just round that corner,' she said.
  She turned to the man. 'Drive on, Lee; we'll take shelter there, if need be,
  till the storm is over.'</p>

  <p>'Far better turn back,' began Ferriby. Then he noticed how her face had
  whitened and her lips trembled, and he let the pony-cart go on. The storm
  might hang for an hour yet over the moors. He was never unwilling to be in
  Dora Ibimay's company.</p>

  <p>'I...don't know what is the matter with me,' she said, catching her wrap
  about her shiveringly. 'I...don't want to go.'</p>

  <p>'Don't tell me you are cold,' he laughed. 'It's like an oven.'</p>

  <p>'I <i>am</i> cold. I am wretched.' She looked a moment round. There was
  little to offer privacy; but a stone fence shut off the pony-trap, and that
  was the only thing of life in the whole expanse. The ribbon of road ran under
  their feet back and forward, and around stretched the earth, sombre-hued,
  lean, and brown. Huge clouds came on slowly, showing up every pile of stones
  and bit of wall bleached and ghastly. And every now and again there was the
  little low moan of the wind.</p>

  <p>'Come back to the Grange,' said Ferriby. 'Stay the night there. I'll drive
  you over first thing in the morning.'</p>

  <p>She shook her head impatiently. 'I'm not thinking of the storm.'</p>

  <p>Ferriby did not imagine she was. As she had been crying out to her own
  heart all along the road, he knew, he knew...</p>

  <p>But neither his life nor his training had fitted John Ferriby to deal with
  the unusual, and Dora was unusual both in herself and as a woman debarred by
  the law.</p>

  <p>With the laws of God Ferriby set himself on an equality. The laws of man
  kept him in check, and he had some time ago determined that this attraction
  between himself and another man's wife should remain as it
  was&mdash;unuttered. Besides, Dora was of different stuff to that young witch
  Irene. With Dora, Ferriby felt himself on the threshold of no vulgar
  intrigue, but of something new&mdash;so new as to be treated with respect, so
  new as to be a little beyond his management, and so for that and every reason
  better left at what it was-unuttered.</p>

  <p>But to-day his humour was ready to chime with the unusual. He was fretted
  generally, vexed with the news about Gisberne. He liked the fellow. He should
  miss him as he should have missed a dog, though there was no reason in it.
  Gisberne had not said or done a thing worth remembrance. Further, thought of
  Irene Garth heated him, and the air was stifling. Not a word till this moment
  had passed between John Ferriby and Dora all the world might not have heard,
  and for an instant he reflected on the security this gave, whatever mutual
  knowledge there might be. Then, with a sudden reckless laugh, he looked
  round, and his eyes spoke into hers, asking, permitting, responding.</p>

  <p>'What is the matter?' he said unmistakably.</p>

  <p>They stopped, facing one another. Dora shuddered nervously closer into her
  wrap.</p>

  <p>'I suppose you are going to marry her?' she said, with averted gaze. There
  was by much no need to mention names.</p>

  <p>'I don't know...perhaps. Why, does it matter?' Then suddenly their hands
  were strongly clasped, and their interest in one another stood bare and
  beyond the power of speech to play with or deny. 'It can't matter, can it, to
  you?' said Ferriby, choosing the words for nothing save to give her an
  opening. And she took it, carried out of herself. She told him that it did
  matter...She clung to his strong hands. Dora Ibimay was not ill-disciplined
  in mind or body. She could feel wonder at her outburst even as it came, but
  she was fighting with something that threatened this man whom she cared for.
  She could have given it no name. She thought it only her sudden passionate
  impulse not to lose him, not to give him up to another. And yet something
  more than mere passion was urging her. Here stood Ferriby in flesh and blood,
  in his completeness, in his splendid strength, the desire of her eyes, met
  late, but met...Dora Ibimay had given no heed to Paul's young beauty. To her
  John Ferriby alone stood the finest man she had beheld, a column that could
  have taken her weight, falling, without a tremor, firm as on pillars of
  brass. And something threatened this epitome of <i>man</i>, and her woman's
  yearning leapt to defend it.</p>

  <p>On the morrow Mrs. Ibimay better understood what was prompting her now,
  and knew she had been inspired, but with only a half-knowledge. Now she
  pleaded with Devil Ferriby not to marry Irene Garth, not to block his future,
  not to cheat her, Dora! She spoke wildly of surrendering everything there and
  then and going away. And she pointed to the gloomy sky and spoke of golden
  sunshine and blue seas far away, and madness generally. She clung to him, her
  white face raised to his, her pleading eyes reading every line, every ravage
  in his softened face.</p>

  <p>'I will make you happier than any woman you have ever known,' she said. 'I
  will make life a different thing, and I will pay any price to do it. I will
  not grow old, I will not die and never have known the utmost life can give me
  because I had not the courage to clutch at it when it came. I care for you, I
  care for you. You must not go back to the Grange...Come, walk on with
  me.'</p>

  <p>And on the morrow Dora came to know that in this extravagance she had been
  blindly fighting death.</p>

  <p>Extravagance it seemed even while uttering it, and she knew it neither
  would nor could affect anything; but on the morrow, in the anguish of
  unavailing recall, she asked herself why Heaven so cruelly had let her stop
  at such poor stuff. Her wild, red-hot words had been as senseless as putting
  out a hand to stop an avalanche, and she had had him there and wasted time on
  words. He was <i>alive</i>, in her sight and touch. And she had
  <i>pleaded</i> with him. She had had him there. And she had let him go.</p>

  <p>Ferriby his side said&mdash;nothing. Nature has taken good care man shall
  not be woman's mentor. He said nothing, but it was he made her say all. He
  listened, knowing she would repent herself, but, for his part, she should
  have everything to repent of. Still, his words were nothing. But if at the
  parting moment the march of life shows like a spectacle seen from a height,
  then strangely within the next hour or two must this interview have flashed
  before John Ferriby. It took place within an hour or two of his violent
  death. '<i>Within...an...hour...or two</i>.' Those few words were to be Dora
  Ibimay's portion, to go over and over, as if she were a soul in penance
  counting her beads of torture. Little they grasped it then. Ferriby glanced
  at the funnel-shaped clouds over seawards and the lowering masses overhead,
  but only to keep watch on Dora's safety; and she, for all her desperate
  emotion, when it came to it, let him go falling back in thought upon the
  morrow...And for him there was to be none.</p>

  <p>Their first parting was a mere feint, and only carried them a few yards.
  Then Ferriby swung round and looked back. She had turned also. There was
  still no one in sight. The whole interview had been a matter of minutes, in
  face of the storm coming up and the fact that she would be drenched and
  frightened.</p>

  <p>Dora would have remembrance of that to mock her, too, upon the morrow. She
  had subdued herself, restrained within bounds her mad desire to snatch this
  man away with her to the ends of the earth, and had let him go because of a
  thunder-storm and the possible curious gaze of a yokel in a pony-cart!</p>

  <p>She stood there looking at him. Ferriby, who never noticed a woman's
  dress, noticed that she was in black and white. In a black straw hat she wore
  white feathers, and around her shoulders the inevitable wrap.</p>

  <p>And the face was white, marked by the dark eyes framed in her heavy
  hair.</p>

  <p>She noted him, too. The picture was to last her longer&mdash;a man's
  figure with face and look absorbed in her. His dress was blue serge, a rose,
  red, drooping there from his buttonhole. Ferriby glanced a moment and stepped
  back.</p>

  <p>'I don't like to leave you. I will see you to the cottage,' he began.</p>

  <p>'No, no, I would rather not.'</p>

  <p>'Shall I come over to-morrow morning first thing?' he asked, standing
  close to her.</p>

  <p>She shook her head, then broke down into the sheer feminine. 'I am
  sorry...forget it,' she said, struggling with blinding tears.</p>

  <p>He made some inarticulate sound, stood regarding her, then moved his head
  gently down as if he would kiss her. But she caught herself away.&mdash;' Oh,
  no, no...good-bye.' Her hand touched his an instant, then she hurried forward
  without looking back.</p>

  <p>Ferriby remained where she left him, and watched the graceful figure till
  the stone fence hid it. He did not want to let her go. Man-like, he had not
  allowed her to estimate by half how much she had moved him. When, finally, he
  turned also from the scene, he felt his face harden and brutalize, and he was
  shaken by a curious anger&mdash;a blind, mounting anger towards Irene Garth.
  Even in her self-abandonment Dora Ibimay could not speak of waiting for her
  husband's death. She would as soon have hastened it. But well Ferriby
  understood on what grounds she could cry out to him that he was cheating her
  by a senseless marriage his side now. At any moment Dora Ibimay might be
  free. He knew, she knew, everyone knew Theodore Ibimay's days were numbered,
  and that the daisies growing now must wither over his head, and in the face
  of that here he was binding himself to this young light-o-'love, this cousin
  of his, Irene.</p>

  <p>But how could he have guessed Dora Ibimay cared for him in such fashion?
  She whose words and look roused in him the new emotion of humility and
  deprecation, and yet made his blood leap, almost for the first time, to know
  he was a Ferriby, and so worthy of any woman's regards. <i>She</i> cared for
  him, she with her delicacy, her haunting pallor and marvellous eyes, her
  suggestive touch and hint of the inexpressible, and he must needs be
  complicated with Irene Garth.</p>

  <p>Ferriby's lips shaped over the name with an oath. The old feeling of six
  years ago assailed him, when he had stood over the young vixen and her
  precious defender, two intruders, most unwelcome, and drawn the lash of his
  whip through his fingers. He would draw that lash again over both of
  them!</p>

  <p>At the head of the lane a flash of lightning roused him. He stopped and
  looked back, as if it were possible to see Mrs. Ibimay. It thundered loudly.
  Her pony bolted at thunder, but she would be home by this time. He strode on,
  bringing her image sacredly forth from amid his furious brutal thoughts
  towards Irene, and holding it as it were a treasure against his heart. At the
  gate again the lightning flashed, showing him the rickyard, the farm
  buildings, the green of the elms against the dark. Ferriby stopped. An
  indescribable pang assailed him. Everything settled again into darkness. A
  cry rose within him to Dora, to the woman who had talked of a new world. He
  wanted to get there. He wanted to hear Dora speaking, to see her
  eyes&mdash;to feel her lips upon his cheek...</p>

  <p>Through the thunder Ferriby caught the sound of the stable-clock striking
  ten. Supper must be over, or had they waited for him? Where was Irene? He
  passed quickly into the house and living-room. Candles were burning and the
  table set, but no one there, and he could hear no sound. The next instant
  there was a rap upon the door behind him, and Gisberne entered.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-12"
     id="ch-1-12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">A prophet has no honour in his own country, and in similar
fashion
  Gisberne's commonplace remarks about trouble ahead if Paul did not leave the
  Grange weighed in their single utterance more with Daphne Estorel than the
  days and weeks of Jane's gloomy prophecies or than all her own
  forebodings.</p>

  <p>She had taken hurried leave of Jane, and re-entered the living-room in
  time to notice the scant courtesy towards Gisberne of Ferriby's departure,
  but she had not heeded it. Devil Ferriby had bad manners. Gisberne was still
  pale, still slightly disturbed, but as little as an animal's could his
  self-control show agitation. He smiled at Daphne, and went at once back to
  the subject that had been interrupted. For himself, he said, as she might
  think, he didn't care a cent; but if it mattered anything to her that Mr.
  Paul didn't get himself into a mess he'd lay himself at Mr. Paul's disposal,
  and no doubt he could fix him up something somewhere in the States. He was
  going back there straight away. Gisberne's introductions (faked or whatever
  they were) had so far placed him on the footing of a gentleman. His attitude
  and tone with Daphne to-day over the playing, and now over Paul, denied that
  pretension, but she was not repelled. The pleasant nature of the man seemed
  only the simpler for it and the more attractive. She felt anew the sensation
  that he was wooing her notice, trying hard to please her, and it touched her
  afresh to think he had not and would never find the courage for anything
  further-that he would leave Ferriby these his only advances.</p>

  <p>The low room became oppressive, and with sense of movement and going away
  stirred in her, Daphne led Gisberne out into the lane. There presently he
  left her, telling her to let him know upon the morrow, first thing, if he
  could serve her...</p>

  <p>So strongly had Gisberne's matter-of-fact remarks affected Daphne that
  now, alone with the memory of them, she felt as if face to face with a
  disaster that had actually occurred. In reality nothing is so great a cheat
  as the brain. Plain speech at last had so undisguisedly shaped visionary
  fears that it came before Daphne with the force of conviction <i>that a
  catastrophe was inevitable, that it would happen to-night, and that Paul
  would he the active mover in it</i>. She looked instinctively towards the
  outbuildings. She could almost persuade herself she heard Paul's footstep
  advancing stealthily, saw his figure lurking in the shadows...Only that
  morning Daphne had read in a weekly paper of a great disaster by fire in a
  famous city abroad, in another paragraph of wars and rumours of wars. Sir
  William had written again, deprecating her refusal of his overtures. He was
  about to start for the East. Magnificent explorations were afoot. They had
  come upon the perfect tomb of a king, dead four thousand years. He should
  spend a night in London, and go to the opera&mdash;almost the last of the
  season. In Paris he hoped to meet M. Carrousel, the great painter, and the
  young scientist, Victor. How he wished she would reconsider her long stay in
  the North! But he was an old man. He feared he could not hope she would ever
  find in him her guide into the world's wonders and delights. <i>The world's
  wonders and delights!</i> Overhead the thunder-clouds were massing, but
  towards Droitlet was still in the dim sky the faint marvel of a few pale
  stars.</p>

  <p>Daphne forced her mind upon these things&mdash;the world, and all its big
  interests, in which hers were nothing, and the pettiness of her thoughts
  against the bigness of earth and sky. It was no use. For three years now to
  live was to think of Paul Ferriby&mdash;to think and to be silent.</p>

  <p>Silence had grown to be her second nature. To seek Paul now and urge upon
  him to leave the Grange for fear of the results of a jealous outburst
  concerning Irene Garth would be a strange violation of it. Yet, as Gisberne
  left her, she stood there goaded to it almost as if some violent deed were
  already accomplished, and Paul in danger of freedom and life.</p>

  <p>She set out to go to him.</p>

  <p>The coach-house, to which, since Irene had thrown herself into his arms,
  Paul had chosen to remove his effects, abandoning his cousin's roof for ever,
  was at the far wall of the great enclosure, a long way from the back of the
  house. A moonless evening, the usual dusk of the hour was deepened by
  thunder-clouds to an obscurity dense enough to hide anyone stealing from
  shadow to shadow, as Daphne did. And the big out-buildings cast big shadows.
  As she passed into the last yard a light shining through the open doors of
  the coach-house opposite brought her to an instant halt. She drew out of
  sight against a waggon, and saw Paul step out into the yard, showing himself
  plainly against the light behind.</p>

  <p>Oh! the world with its wonders and delights; the sky with its stars and
  its awe! Small use to remember them or to quote them to herself. A man, a
  young man, no one to be proud of&mdash;in bonds to another woman, outweighed
  it all. 'Youth calls to youth the whole world over.' Daphne's girlhood met
  her, and claimed her.</p>

  <p>Paul stood strangely still, as if listening. He seemed to look straight
  towards her place of concealment. She was only two-and-twenty. Her heart
  exalted him as he showed there in his strong young manhood as the most that
  God could do, and she loved him to the utmost love could go. She could not
  move or speak. Habit was still too strong, and her unrealized fears were
  still not equal in effect to the sight of him controlled and quiet; but into
  her silence she concentrated all her being. As if under its influence, Paul
  remained there motionless. Her heart clamoured towards him. The silent strain
  of her must span this little distance between them, and strive with him,
  convince him, win him! Could the mere utterance of words really avail more
  than this passion of every fibre, this agony to communicate her feeling?</p>

  <p>A play of lightning suddenly showed up the rooflines, and at the same
  instant there came a sound of hurrying footsteps, and quickened, frightened
  breath, and a white-clad figure brushed by Daphne's hiding place. It was
  Irene.</p>

  <p>Daphne did not wait to see them meet. She returned to the house, and went
  up to her room. Her silence was still unbroken. While she had wrestled in her
  soul with Paul, he had stood there motionless-yes, listening for Irene
  Garth!</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">'What the dickens&mdash;you!' said Ferriby.</p>

  <p>Gisberne advanced, not pausing at all upon his entrance, giving no hint of
  offence taken or intended.</p>

  <p>'I wanted to speak to you,' he said. 'I was waiting. You passed me in the
  lane.'</p>

  <p>'Passed you in the lane&mdash;just now?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>Ferriby uttered an angry exclamation. His thoughts had been so private and
  intense he felt as if he had been spied upon.</p>

  <p>'What do you want, Mr. Gisberne?' he asked roughly. 'I thought you
  understood there was an end of things. You'd better clear out. I don't want
  to give information about you.' As he spoke Ferriby went up to the table. A
  spirit-stand was by the carver's place, the bottles well filled. He mixed a
  big drink and drained it.</p>

  <p>'I wish you would lend me a little money, Mr. Ferriby,' said Gisberne,
  drawing nearer to him.</p>

  <p>Ferriby set down the glass and stared. If one of the dogs had asked it he
  could not have been more surprised.</p>

  <p>'Lend you money!' he echoed.</p>

  <p>'Yes. I'm in a fix. I throw myself upon your mercy. I want a little money
  to get away to the States with. I'll pay you back.'</p>

  <p>'Well, upon my word!' Ferriby was too astonished to be angry. 'You've got
  the cheek of the devil,' he said.</p>

  <p>'I've done <i>you</i> no harm.' Gisberne spoke quite pleasantly. 'There's
  been some little friendliness between us.' And he stood waiting.</p>

  <p>Ferriby regarded him in a divided humour. Gisberne's unconsciousness was
  worth something. What sort of a fellow could he be? Not the slightest
  agitation! His pallor and quiet manner, and the earnest look of the eyes,
  were confounding. Lend him money!...Ferriby stared, and hesitated between
  such impatient toleration of something outside himself as he showed his horse
  and ordinary anger with colossal impudence.</p>

  <p>Heated by the spirits he had just taken, the latter triumphed, and flared
  out. He called Gisberne a few hard names, and showed him the door, Gisberne
  making little answer, and seeming rather reflective than hurt.</p>

  <p>'No need to make a noise,' he said. 'I wanted the money. You've got it,
  and could very well spare it.'</p>

  <p>'To a card-sharper and a swindler?'</p>

  <p>'That's only one man's talk,' said Gisberne.</p>

  <p>'What are you clearing out for, then?' scoffed Ferriby. 'You came here as
  a gentleman and a musician!' He laughed roughly. 'Come, now,' he added,
  'don't try any of this rubbish. You must have enough change to take you away
  with. Think yourself lucky you can go.'</p>

  <p>It never occurred to Ferriby that Gisberne might carry a revolver or think
  of violence. His notions that way were native of the soul. Besides, Gisberne
  was too quiet. He turned with an appeal about him like a disappointed
  dog.</p>

  <p>Ferriby flung after him to the gate. The lightning was now continuous.
  Still no rain! He looked after the clean-cut, lightly-moving
  figure&mdash;<i>walking</i> away. The beggar had sold his horse! To Devil
  Ferriby here was a touch of the abject, smiting him with a pang of relenting.
  It was turning a dog from the door, and, to carry the fancy further, a
  creature Dora Ibimay would have given him a glance from those eyes of hers
  for being kind to.</p>

  <p>'Here, you'd better shelter till the storm is over!' he called after the
  grey, shadowy figure; but Gisberne did not seem to hear, hurrying on into the
  darkening space.</p>

  <p>Daphne, moving about her room&mdash;it was not her way to brood seated or
  in idleness&mdash;thought to hear Irene entering hers opposite. It was a
  hasty rush of light footsteps and the soft closing of a door. She could not
  be sure, for her room was immense, and at the far end of it all sounds, even
  close without, were vague and uncertain. If it were Irene, she had used, as
  she very rarely did, the main stairway and the entrance to the bedroom facing
  her own. Then, thought Daphne, there is someone below in the living-room whom
  Irene wished to avoid. She descended, and found Devil Ferriby. He had only
  that moment returned after seeing Gisberne depart, and, as Daphne entered,
  was helping himself to spirits, his manner quiet to brooding&mdash;Devil
  Ferriby's manner when he set himself to drinking freely.</p>

  <p>He made a remark, pointing to the unused table.</p>

  <p>'There seems nothing alive, inside or out. What's the matter, that nobody
  has had any supper?'</p>

  <p>'The storm, perhaps. I don't know...we scattered. Did you meet Mr.
  Gisberne?'</p>

  <p>'What makes you mention him?' asked Ferriby, subduing his tone, as he
  always did with Daphne Estorel.</p>

  <p>'I was only wondering if he would reach Droitlet before the storm,' she
  answered.</p>

  <p>Ferriby seemed about to speak, checked himself.</p>

  <p>'Where is Irene?' he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>'In her room.'</p>

  <p>Daphne flung the words out swiftly, astonishing herself. She did not
  <i>know</i> Irene was there.</p>

  <p>'Oh...Well, I'll take Scarside's rounds to-night. You're going to bed, I
  suppose?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.' She was watching him intently, though half unconsciously, in the
  beginning of a strain of the senses, to increase as the night went on, till,
  by dawn. Daphne Estorel would know the highest pitch to which nerves can be
  strung. 'Will you leave the little gate open?' she said.&mdash;' The two
  girls are not back&mdash;frightened at the storm, I suppose. I don't expect
  them now, but I shall not bolt the kitchen door, in case.'</p>

  <p>Ferriby nodded shortly. A bolt not shot, or a door unfastened, counted for
  little in the nightly defences of the Grange. They were pretty complete and
  widely well known.</p>

  <p>'Good-night,' he said. 'Better shut those windows. The rain will be
  driving in any minute.'</p>

  <p>As Daphne obeyed she caught sight of Ferriby outside, illuminated
  strangely by a lightning flash, and the flowers on the sill ran an instant
  into colour in ghastly fashion.</p>

  <p>'Good-night,' she called, suddenly and clearly.</p>

  <p>'Good-night, Daphne.'</p>

  <p>She heard his steps into the yard, and the rhythmical decrease of the
  little jangle of the gate as it fell into place behind him. Her heart was
  beating fast, every nerve on the alert. It occurred to her strongly that Paul
  and John Ferriby were alone out there in the open. But the meeting witnessed
  between Paul and Irene had altered her mood, and thrown her back into the
  spell-bound spectator of something inevitable. Leaving a couple of candles
  burning&mdash;for Ferriby would return here&mdash;she hurried again upstairs.
  It struck her that the house echoed to her footsteps. What a host seemed to
  have gone in Mistress Skidfell and two maidservants! To what fate was Ferriby
  deserted? She knocked on Irene's door.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' came instant answer in Irene's voice. 'Yes-who is there?'</p>

  <p>'I only wanted to be sure you were in,' said Daphne. Before she could move
  away the door was opened, and Sophy appeared, showing a pale and anxious
  face.</p>

  <p>'Miss 'Rene's dreadfully frightened about the storm, miss,' she
  said,&mdash;' and so am I. I can't sleep alone, Miss Deffny&mdash;you won't
  mind if I stay here?'</p>

  <p>For a breath Daphne gazed on the girl, the mad thought crossing her that
  Paul was in the room behind her. Then she turned away ashamed, and entered
  her own room, but gave no thought to bed. The storm came nearer. By half-past
  ten thunder and lightning had grown violent and continuous, and the more
  awesome since, from a sky blackened and bursting, there was still no
  rain.</p>

  <p>Ferriby, re-entering the house by the way he had left it, bolted the door
  and stood in the pitch-black entry, giving an ear to any chance movement in
  the living-room. The candle-light, steady since the casements were all shut,
  sent a yellow gleam across the flags, gone the next instant in a blue and
  blinding glare. Nothing stirred. 'No, she wouldn't be down waiting alone in a
  thunderstorm, the jade!' thought Ferriby savagely. Yet he had the instinct of
  some human presence near. He strode on into the room, throwing the door wide.
  Instantly there touched him the curious impression that everything in the
  room was shouting out at him-shouting something. It was the effect of
  life-long familiarity and the intense stillness&mdash;he had had it before,
  entering this room alone at night, when the rest of the household slept. He
  moved down to the bureau. Here the candle-light shone faintly and played
  strange tricks with the old picture sunk above the mantelshelf.</p>

  <p>'What's the matter with <i>you?</i>' said Ferriby, looking up at the
  painted faces watching him from the panel. He opened the bureau, let down the
  flap, and stood unheeding, erect and still. Was he thinking? Scarcely. The
  storm was making a wild noise. Some vague, tumultuous notion of battles, far
  off or long ago, caught him into a sudden trance. In a vision of feeling (or
  remembrance) he felt himself out in a mad tumult, dashing through crash and
  clatter, and hurtling of hoofs and steel. Against a pitch-black sky, a
  woman's figure flashed into sight above grey battlements, arms outstretched
  to him below, passionate eyes alight like stars, and heavy hair. He felt the
  wind sing through tossing plumes upon his head, and the lightning run blue up
  an outstretched sword. Then a sudden dart touched the pile of gold by
  Ferriby's hand. He came to himself with a start, and moved towards the
  window. 'I hope the ricks won't fire,' was his reflection, and he gave a
  satisfied remembrance to that young whelp Paul, who slept outside. He had not
  seen him on his rounds, or troubled to. Irene was a different matter, and
  Ferriby's thoughts swerved anew to her with wrath. Again he helped himself
  freely, and drank. The visions of his race were swept from the blood, and
  left him there, brutalized, to meet a death unworthy of his name.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">'Irene!' Ferriby spoke aloud, for he had again the feeling
someone was
  about. Perhaps the young witch was hiding. He stood steadying himself, lit a
  cigarette and went softly up the stairs&mdash;the first time, he fancied, he
  had been up them in his life&mdash;and rapped on her door. 'Are you there?'
  he said. 'I want to speak to you-you knew it. What d'ye mean by keeping
  yourself up here?'</p>

  <p>The sound of the rap and the voice, and the tone of it, fell the other
  side of the closed door between Sophy Bassett and Irene, bending together
  over a drawer taken from its chest and set in the middle of the room, and
  turned them for a breath as if to stone. The green curtains were drawn close,
  and in a blaze of lamp and candle light the two girls had selected clothes
  from a tumbled heap, laying them stealthily into a trunk. A small hand-valise
  stood on a chair, already locked and strapped.</p>

  <p>'The master!' gasped Sophy. 'Lor, Miss 'Rene, I told you so.'</p>

  <p>Irene was staring at the door. 'Is it locked, Sophy?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Now then, Irene!' came Ferriby's voice, and they noticed he was smoking.
  'You're not in bed?'</p>

  <p>'I'm just going to bed. Cousin John.' Irene's lips were white, but such
  her loveliness that, even at that moment, frightened as she was, Sophy, from
  her kneeling posture, stared up at it absorbed. 'I have a headache through
  the thunder, Cousin John.'</p>

  <p>'Rubbish! Who is in there with you?'</p>

  <p>The girls exchanged a horrified glance.</p>

  <p>'Sophy, Cousin John.'</p>

  <p>'Oh...Well, I want to speak to you. Come down and see me below, or I shall
  break this door open. I'll give you five minutes.'</p>

  <p>They heard his retreating step, light for his build. Sophy sprang up.</p>

  <p>'There, ain't I said it, Miss 'Rene? He saw you with Mr. Paul. Ain't I
  told you not to go?'</p>

  <p>Irene stared at her. She was fully dressed as she had come in, a necklace
  of amber beads round her throat.</p>

  <p>'He will kill me,' she said.</p>

  <p>'Kill you? Don't talk such stuff. Miss 'Rene! Kill you?&mdash;not even if
  you went down to him: and you ain't thinking of that, are you?'</p>

  <p>'He'll break in here.'</p>

  <p>'Let him, miss! I'll tackle him...You just go across to Miss
  Deffny...'</p>

  <p>'And let <i>her</i> know that I am <i>afraid</i> of Cousin John!'</p>

  <p>Irene's eyes flashed, and she made a movement towards the door.</p>

  <p>'Now don't be silly, miss.' Sophy caught her by the arm. 'The master's
  been drinking. Don't you go.'</p>

  <p>'But I'm going to marry him,' whispered Irene, strangely, staring and
  shivering.</p>

  <p>'And here you are packing to get away from him, miss. You hev' made a mess
  of it. Miss 'Rene, that you hev'.' And Sophy wrung her hands.</p>

  <p>Irene looked at her and round the room wildly. 'Yes...I don't
  know&mdash;I'm frightened...I don't know what to do. I think I like Mr. John
  best, Sophy. Mr. Paul was very queer just now...an&mdash;I was mad, I think.
  I wish I had let him go when he wanted to.'</p>

  <p>She moved again to the door; again Sophy intervened. 'Don't go. Miss
  'Rene; you'll wish you hadn't.'</p>

  <p>Irene looked into the other girl's shrewd, knowing eyes, the face sharp
  with feminine alarm, eager in her service, very plainly showing what she
  meant. 'Do you think he will kill me?' she breathed.</p>

  <p>'No, Miss 'Rene&mdash;I <i>don't</i>' she answered, with desperate
  emphasis. 'Oh, Miss 'Rene, go over to Miss Deffny&mdash;leave me to
  manage.'</p>

  <p>But Irene Garth's impulses had whirled again at the sound of Ferriby's
  voice. Paul to-night had been cold and strange, not the lover of the past
  weeks, not even the old, sullen, reproachful young adorer. She hated
  him...she was afraid of Ferriby; she was packing as if to go, kept up to it
  by the excitement of Sophy Bassett's wondering adoration and a vague thought
  of Gisberne and kindness&mdash;but Ferriby's voice had brought her back to an
  old thrill. And to seek refuge from Cousin John with Daphne Estorel&mdash;any
  fate at a man's hands would be more acceptable. Cousin John&mdash;she could
  manage him. And how could she go away from the Grange! She had been mad to
  give Paul a thought. She hated him...she would go to Cousin John; she would
  tell him she was afraid of Paul, as she had just now told Paul she was afraid
  of Devil Ferriby.</p>

  <p>Pushing Sophy aside, white and shaking, but not to be turned, Irene caught
  up a blue wrap with wide sleeves, kimono-shaped. There was no reason in the
  action; it was the purely instinctive idea of something to shelter in. 'Wait
  here, Sophy,' she said, pushing her aside. 'Don't be absurd. I know what to
  do.' And she ran down the stairs, light as a phantom, and Sophy heard her
  drop the latch of the door below behind her.</p>

  <p>Five minutes passed, six, seven. Sophy Bassett, straining her ears, could
  catch nothing from below; at the same time never in her life had she heard
  anything like the roar of the thunder-claps, coming up over the hollow moors,
  smashing upon the roof, reverberating like musketry through the empty rooms
  and galleries. The lightning to the street-bred girl was an unknown thing,
  wide as the world, appalling. She gave a thought to Miss Deffny. Amid this
  horrid clamour it was like thinking of the first pure stillness of dawn as
  she had learnt to know it this summer at the Grange. Should she go across to
  Miss Deffny? That would be to let her know Miss 'Rene wasn't here...</p>

  <p>Sophy glanced round at all the tumbled clothes and sighed. 'Lor'! Miss
  'Rene had gone a bit too far,' she muttered with locked hands.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes passed, eleven, twelve, and then Sophy heard a sound below,
  the first, distinct in a sudden lull. It made the girl dart back from the
  open bedroom door. She wouldn't for anything have Miss 'Rene think she had
  been listening. She heaved a quick sigh of relief to hear her come up the
  stairs, and bustled to the dressing-table and snuffed a candle, turning round
  then with a word of welcome&mdash;arrested, never uttered. She ran forward
  and paused.</p>

  <p>It was Irene, but Sophy did not know her. From that chalk-white face from
  which every drop of blood seemed withdrawn, and that rigid stark advancing
  figure, Sophy fell away as if before a spectre, too terrified to shriek.</p>

  <p>'He's dead,' said Irene, pushing her before her, back towards the
  window&mdash;' he's dead!'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-13"
     id="ch-1-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">You're gammoning me, Miss 'Rene,' said Sophy. X She found
she had got hold
  of the rigid figure and was shaking it to and fro. 'It ain't true...oh, my
  Lord! tell me it ain't true. The master dead! You ain't <i>killed him</i>,
  Miss 'Rene?'</p>

  <p>'Hush! don't talk so loud...' It was like the voice of a sleep-walker, the
  words coming through lips that seemed frozen apart. 'He had been drinking; he
  was drinking when I got down...Hush, what is it? Is he coming?' One
  half-petrified figure dragged the other to the door. Irene thrust her head
  forward, listening, still gripping her companion in a mad terror.</p>

  <p>'Look here, Miss 'Rene,' cried Sophy in a gasping whisper, but nerving
  herself. 'You ain't done nothing&mdash;that's my belief. I'm a-going down to
  see.'</p>

  <p>'Wait...wait!' And then with renewal of shock Sophy noticed Miss 'Rene's
  blue wrap was not with her and the amber beads gone from her throat.</p>

  <p>Her tears broke forth. 'What have you done. Miss 'Rene? Where's that blue
  thing? Where's your beads?'</p>

  <p>'He put out the candles.' Irene was still staring down the stairs as she
  spoke, her voice a whisper, short, hollow sounds as from a throat dry as
  lime. 'He said I was a light-o'-love. He said he knew I'd been with Paul. He
  said he'd teach me my worth...The lightning...I could see his face...I didn't
  understand, you know&mdash;I didn't understand till then. You told me not to
  go&mdash;didn't you, Sophy?' She clutched closer, her white teeth rattling
  between the parted, frozen lips. 'What shall I do? He took hold of me...'</p>

  <p>'Oh, Miss 'Rene!' It was a smothered cry, almost maternal.</p>

  <p>'I fought him,' whispered Irene. 'I got away. But...'</p>

  <p>'Oh, Miss 'Rene, and you didn't call,' wailed Sophy.</p>

  <p>'Hush! I don't want Daphne to hear. I didn't think of calling...I did
  call...He shook me and...I don't know...I flung the wrap over him, right over
  his head...I ran down to the fireplace; he followed, and I saw him..."a
  sheeted ghost."' She threw back her head as if she laughed, and swayed and
  shuddered in Sophy's terrified hold&mdash;'"a sheeted ghost."...He couldn't
  get it off; he stumbled and fell; he struck his head against the
  fender&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Well,' gasped Sophy. 'Oh, Miss 'Rene, what then?'</p>

  <p>'He's dead,' said Irene.</p>

  <p>'You never touched him, miss?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'Jest let him lie, and come up straight here to me?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>The strain that had sharpened Sophy Bassett's features relaxed. The tears
  of terror, flowing unconsciously, changed to a more wholesome sniff. 'Oh,
  lor', Miss 'Rene,' she said, 'you all but scared me to death. Ain't you got
  more sense? The master ain't <i>dead</i>. Lor'! I've seen 'em fall like that
  same as flies. It was just the drink in him and tumbling, and you confusin'
  of him like with the wrap&mdash;fency your a-thinkin' of it, Miss 'Rene!'
  Sophy sniffed with a touch of hysterical giggle. 'He ain't hurt, miss. He'll
  come to all right.'</p>

  <p>'There are some spikes on the fender,' whispered Irene, but her tone had
  also grown more natural.</p>

  <p>A moment Sophy's face paled again, but she recovered herself anew.&mdash;'
  Well, Miss 'Rene, it's his own fault&mdash;I'll swear to that. He ain't hurt
  'imself, you'll find, though&mdash;not after drinkin'.' She set her head
  knowingly. 'But we can't leave him there, Miss 'Rene. He'll need some water
  or a drop o' brandy. I'll go down.'</p>

  <p>During this the storm, though more intermittent, had grown more appalling,
  save that a spattering of rain announced a deluge; but the two girls had
  heard nothing beyond their own whispers, seen nothing but the white terror of
  the other's face.</p>

  <p>Sophy crept down the stairs; a few steps from the bottom she looked back
  reassuringly. 'It's all right, Miss 'Rene; he's lighting a candle.' And even
  as she formed the words with her lips over her shoulder, rather than uttered
  them, the flare of a match and then the steadier gleam of the wax candle
  filled up the slit by which the door hung unclosed, and struck a line down
  the panelled wall like a ghostly barrier flung before Sophy's advance.</p>

  <p>It acted as a barrier. There was no movement from the room, and the girls
  crouched, arrested.</p>

  <p>Gradually, moving with the utmost stealth, Irene worked past Sophy, and
  placed herself close to the door. It was not latched. At a touch it would
  swing back and show her what was happening, but for a long time she did
  nothing. A strangely long time it seemed to Sophy, who would have urged her
  boldly forward; but Irene, with signs and resistance, bade her be still. The
  girl could not well see Miss 'Rene's face, but she felt that something in her
  attitude had changed. She became aware of the noise of the thunder, and it
  crossed her mind Miss Daphne might come over to the room above and find it
  empty. Only Miss Daphne wouldn't be afraid of thunder. The thought and image
  of Daphne came to Sophy, huddled there in the dark as if, gazing on a
  blackened world, she had suddenly seen, through a rift in hideous clouds, a
  far-off star. But she came swiftly back to the moment to hear faint movements
  from the room&mdash;to see Irene, strained and motionless, at the chink.
  Sophy tiptoed behind her. 'Best come away. Miss 'Rene,' she whispered at the
  other's ear. 'He's come to...hear him breathing?...Don't let him find you
  here, miss.'</p>

  <p>Breathing was audible, and the faint lap of water and something of
  stumbling and shuffling, if they could be sure of discerning anything even
  with ears preternaturally sharpened, for the rain was now torrential, and the
  hurly-burly of a gale driving all noises to and fro in an incredible
  tumult.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Irene glanced round, and her eyes, widened, half mad, gleamed
  into the ones behind her; then she thrust Sophy backwards, and pushed the
  door ajar...She looked straight at the figure of Devil Ferriby. He seemed to
  be lying where she fancied she had left him&mdash;he was huge, all-pervading,
  a colossal image of himself. There was a pad of something white, something
  wet, on his face. At the other end of the room a man, holding a candle, set
  down something heavy on the table. As he turned, stealthy as a cat, he blew
  out the candle; but even as he did so the lightning ran through the room,
  picked out things, and showed Irene who it was.</p>

  <p>'He's drinking again, ain't he?' breathed Sophy, craning over Irene's
  shoulder. 'He's put out the light. Miss 'Rene...<i>come</i>...he's seen
  us.'</p>

  <p>Irene left the door; she followed Sophy upstairs. Followed
  her!&mdash;rather seemed to bear her up with her in some resistless progress.
  When they reached the light Sophy saw Miss 'Rene look like an old woman,
  jabbering and mowing...she was mad!</p>

  <p>The girl had no time to frame a thought. Irene bore her before her into
  the centre of the room, and dragged her down with her into a heap among the
  tumbled clothes. Her fingers seemed to dig into Sophy's shoulders. She was
  jabbering to herself. The door stood wide open behind them on the dark
  stairway.</p>

  <p>'Hush! Be quiet! Don't move, don't move! I didn't see, I didn't see! Be
  quiet I Don't move! It's nothing, it's nothing!'</p>

  <p>Sophy, paralyzed with fear, beside which the first shock Miss 'Rene had
  inflicted seemed as nothing, stared through the open doorway, her eyes glued
  there expecting she knew not what. The storm, making a quick circle, renewed
  itself in hideous clamour. The candles were burning down. The lamp, caught in
  the wind by their entrance, began to smoke, but Irene did not alter her fixed
  attitude nor the vice-like grip, which kept Sophy powerless and afraid to
  move.</p>

  <p>Superstitious terror and wordless panic would not even let her try to
  move. 'Be quiet! It's nothing, it's nothing!' jabbered Irene, with a mad face
  close to hers. Sophy prayed and shook and kept her eyes fixed on the open
  doorway and the stairway beyond. No one ascended it&mdash;no human sounds
  could be distinguished coming from below or from anywhere in the great,
  empty, storm-ridden house.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Daphne Estorel had not slept, nor thought of even undressing. With the
  feeling that Paul was gone beyond her influence, the goad to immediate action
  had been withdrawn. Robert Gisberne's words became more his way of expressing
  that he wished to serve her, a certain curious wooing of her, similar to his
  musical display, than the definite dread they had been. Paul and immediate
  violence ceased to be associated. Our spiritual warnings fail because too
  often timed too soon or too late. Daphne had let Devil Ferriby go off on a
  lonely walk around the premises with no thought of staying him. The panic
  that had driven her a short time previously to seek out Paul himself had
  expended itself. No fear assailed her that Paul might choose that moment and
  the cover of the storm to settle differences with the man he hated. His
  image, as waiting for Irene while she fought for and with him in silence,
  occupied her mind. She was glad of her silence now, glad that these fierce
  three years she had said no word to add to Irene's triumph or to add shame to
  her defeat.</p>

  <p>Sophy Bassett thought Miss Daphne a saint in a niche, a statue for ever
  clothed. Statues and saints have a lonely fate, and to-night Daphne felt hers
  lonely. The saint was riven in her soul, the wrappings of temperament that
  had kept her so still were insupportable, and she tore at them.</p>

  <p>She&mdash;even as Irene&mdash;would have been glad of company this
  witch-ridden night. She burnt no lights because she set her casement open and
  could not, but the outer air was better than the closed-in room, though the
  storm seemed to enter bodily. No nature, save to its own loss, can grow
  beyond the sense of awe, and Daphne blenched and held her breath, but still
  her spirit threw itself into the battle. Leaning at the window, her eyes grew
  dazzled, and she fancied she could catch the white quiver of waves tossed up
  against the blackness far away, and a sense of tossing freedom and wild
  disdain filled her with a kindred upleaping against her own fate.</p>

  <p>Paul was lost to her&mdash;her lofty, sensitive silence had failed. Irene
  Garth&mdash;oh, thought of scorn!&mdash;had won him. But could she forgo her
  love and her desire? She shrank within herself, crying to the thunder to
  crash more loudly, to the lightning to be more violent. For love of Paul
  Ferriby, to keep near and dear his dark, marked face, she felt herself
  capable of madness and violence&mdash;for which she was glad to hail the
  sympathy and the encouragement of the storm.</p>

  <p>Ferriby's return to the house she did not hear nor catch a glimpse of, nor
  any sound from Irene's room; each chamber was huge and the landing wide. The
  light from the living-room shone across the box-edged path below the window,
  and Daphne noted its disappearance. After a while, her eyes directed there
  now with a return of the strain of her senses swift as a tightening snatch at
  a slack string, she noted that the light gleamed there again. She watched;
  again it disappeared. Daphne rose, and looked at the time-a little past
  eleven! Devil Ferriby, then, was still below. Convinced of this, not
  consciously in the least questioning it. Daphne found herself lighting the
  old-fashioned wax taper which Jane Skidfell still supplied to be carried
  about the house at night. In the same fashion, calm, without any fears or
  questions, she found herself going from the room and proceeding quietly to
  make her way downstairs.</p>

  <p>Daphne was some moments making her way through the vast house. She went
  slowly, almost thoughtfully, as if her destination were something apart from
  her reflections. The stairway and passages showed ghostly in the electric
  flare, that flitted the more strangely where the windows were few. Passing
  through the mighty kitchen, an ordinary house-length to traverse. Daphne
  paused an instant at the door into the living-room, and, lifting the latch,
  let it fall clearly, as if she meant a warning. She was sure that Devil
  Ferriby was within.</p>

  <p>'John,' she said, stepping across the threshold. She imagined that he
  might have fallen into stupor and be exposed to some danger from the storm.
  It was the way her errand presented itself to her now she was face to face
  with it.</p>

  <p>The feeble taper light could not show her much. Her first impression was
  of everything in order and as she had left it. The bureau was shut. She
  noticed that, for its polished surface winked back the little flame. She came
  up to the table, set for supper, and it flashed across her that she had
  strangely forgotten to gather up the silver. It gleamed, and her eye was
  caught by a mark of wet upon the satin surface of the cloth. A large china
  bowl filled with water to hold the centrepiece of white and crimson peonies
  had been disturbed; the petals of the flowers were strewn...From the taper
  Daphne lit one of the candles, and then she saw a man's body lying stark
  between the table and the bureau, feet to the window. The face was turned
  from her. Daphne set down the light she still held.</p>

  <p>We read and we are told that at moments of great shock the faculties,
  stunned, refuse to carry emotion or expression, or else, like a system out of
  order, transmit insanities and panic. But Daphne's mind was clear. If that
  prone man were Paul, and he were dead, then she would die this instant, too.
  The personality of her love, the materialism of it, the capacity for anything
  that should express it, touched her as flame touching her naked heart. She
  could think herself dead already and in torment as she passed round the table
  to see his face&mdash;his face again, her love's face...his, his...</p>

  <p>She saw the red rose drooping still in the smart coat. Paul wore no
  flowers. Daphne, stooping and recognizing Devil Ferriby, fell in the same
  breath from her heights of silence to the very groundwork of our human loves
  and fears. She was glad, selfishly and horribly <i>glad</i> for this dead man
  might have been Paul.</p>

  <p>After one of those intervals in which the spirit stretches a moment to an
  age. Daphne found herself standing erect, and staring with renewed vision
  upon the contorted features, the prone, massive figure.</p>

  <p>Then she heard her name breathed softly, and looked up without start or
  surprise to see that Robert Gisberne was standing in the further doorway.</p>

  <p>In the medley of feeble light and the dartings of the lightning his face
  appeared ghastly pale. He was wet through, his soft hat dripping; but his
  voice was unchanged, his brown eyes as steady in their gaze, as pleasant in
  their look, as ever.</p>

  <p>'What's the matter. Miss Daphne?' he whispered.</p>

  <p>'Come here,' she breathed back; 'come here.'</p>

  <p>'I'm drenched,' he answered. 'I've just done a fine thing: climbed in
  through the window of this room across here. The door was bolted, and I
  didn't want to rouse the house. I was drowning, though. I opened the door
  opposite to see if anyone was about, and saw your light. I thought it might
  be Mr. Ferriby, and that I'd better show myself. I'm glad I did.' He appeared
  now to see the figure on the floor. 'You don't want to be left here with a
  man in that state. Go away, Miss Daphne; I'll see to him. If only I could
  change this coat...I'm making a pool.'</p>

  <p>Daphne did not hear half this. Perhaps Gisberne knew she didn't. He
  delivered it below his breath, with a strange facility for one usually so
  brief, the patter in it as of a set speech to divert an audience. He came
  smilingly a step or two, pointed to the marks he made, and stopped. Careless
  manner and words showed he took Ferriby to have succumbed to drunken
  sleep.</p>

  <p>'Come here,' whispered Daphne again.</p>

  <p>He looked into her face and obeyed. 'Why&mdash;' He turned his eyes on
  hers.</p>

  <p>'He's dead, Mr. Gisberne.'</p>

  <p>'I see it...Good God! what's this?'...He stooped and moved a knife that
  transfixed the coat one side. It had been driven down as if meant for the
  heart, but, as if glancing off the ivory-like surface of the starched
  waistcoat, had pierced instead the open coat close to the dead man's
  side.</p>

  <p>'A muff shot,' said Gisberne, showing the clasp-knife on his palm.&mdash;'
  That's not hurt him.'</p>

  <p>The knife was Paul's! 'You keep that,' whispered Gisberne, letting down
  the snapping blade cautiously. 'Now, let's see. Perhaps he isn't dead, Miss
  Daphne, after all.'</p>

  <p>Daphne took the knife and stood while Gisberne knelt and listened for the
  heart-beats. He shook his head. 'But I tell you what,' he said, rising, 'this
  is Mr. Paul's work or it's nothing. Now, we don't want anybody more in this
  business than we can help till we know which it is, or&mdash;Don't let me
  take too much on myself...Do you think well to rouse somebody?'</p>

  <p>'Who is there to rouse?' she answered, looking at him strangely.</p>

  <p>'That's true,' said Gisberne. 'Well, then, suppose you help me carry this
  poor chap into that room yonder. I'll try all I know to get him round, and
  you might see if Mr. Paul is handy to go slap off for a doctor. If he's
  <i>not</i>, well, I'll do anything I can. I've said that.'</p>

  <p>He spoke and looked with a perfect understanding that something might have
  to be understood between them in a moment or two, and his dog-like eyes
  assured her with a glance of tender kindness of a dog-like service.</p>

  <p>Daphne slipped the clasp-knife into her bosom. 'We'll see if we can bring
  him round,' she said. 'He will be better on the bed.'</p>

  <p>She <i>looked</i> into Gisberne's eyes the rest, the <i>rest</i> still for
  the moment thrust away, unutterable, unexpressed.</p>

  <p>'Take the feet,' he commanded.</p>

  <p>It was an experience like flying, like walking the waves, like anything
  impossible to humanity suddenly made possible and being done, that transit of
  twenty yards or so, the inert body between them. Daphne was conscious of no
  strain, only of a semi-delirious, incongruous elation that Ferriby should
  dare to be this dead weight on them and she and Gisberne to be so equal to
  it.</p>

  <p>They laid the great figure decently upon the bed, and Gisberne mopped his
  livid forehead. 'Has it hurt you V he gasped, when he could get the
  words.</p>

  <p>'No, no...'</p>

  <p>'Sit down,' he went on, through his painful breaths. 'I'm going for a
  light and to leave things straight.'</p>

  <p>He took off his sopped coat and hat and laid them down. 'Can you find a
  cloth?' he whispered. 'I've made a pool in there.'</p>

  <p>The room was arranged for use, but she glanced at the towels and then
  slipped off her white petticoat and gave him that, and followed him across
  the passage. Deft were his movements, quick and clever. He disarranged the
  table completely, pulling the cloth as if it had been dragged at by some
  helpless hand, turned over a chair and displaced the hearthrug. Then,
  latching both doors, he brought away the lighted candle and the taper. It all
  occupied only a matter of seconds.</p>

  <p>As the door into the living-room shut behind them, and Daphne and Gisberne
  were revealed to each other plainly, he spoke instantly.&mdash;' We've got it
  right so far,' he said, and the figure, stretched darkly on the bed, seen
  through the open door, gave ghastly point to his still laboured breathing and
  whitened lips. 'Now, Miss Daphne, will you go and see if Mr. Paul is there,
  and can start right off for a doctor? Is it worth that to you?'</p>

  <p>'And if he <i>is</i> there?' She searched Gisberne's face.</p>

  <p>'Well, I guess we can manage. If he <i>isn't</i> there'&mdash;he gave her
  a kind, far-seeing look&mdash;' well. Miss Daphne, we must think what to do.
  Put on this waterproof; it has a hood. And what sort of shoes are you
  wearing? Why, here are a pair of rubbers. First-rate!'</p>

  <p>Of all the mad, the blasphemous incongruities, could aught be madder than
  this&mdash;thought for her shoulders and her feet at such a moment? But it
  did not so strike Daphne Estorel; rather it seemed a nice exactitude in the
  scheme of thought on which she and Gisberne had entered unanimously, to be
  followed out without any fuss, but with a purpose as straightforward as
  unalterable. The monstrous thing that had happened was already in the
  background of what must now be done.</p>

  <p>In the entry hung an array of outdoor garments-men's and women's, old and
  new&mdash;of every description. Gisberne took down the waterproof, and Daphne
  arrayed herself, paying a curious attention to detail; then, with a swift
  glance of understanding, a little unconscious bracing of herself together,
  she stood by while Gisberne noiselessly and deftly slipped the bolt. He
  remained, giving her cautious lighting till she had passed the gate. Daphne's
  nerves were strained to their uttermost, strung beyond any possibility of
  jar; she was moving in an unreflective world, unhampered by any fear, save
  the fear not to achieve what she was about, but her senses were clear and
  cognizant. She remembered her footsteps might leave marks, and was careful
  where she trod, and she kept clear of the ricks that every other moment
  flashed out into ghastly vision.</p>

  <p>She had the fancy as she passed the waggon, where an hour ago she had
  drawn back from the sight of Paul, that she still stood there a phantom
  shape. Yes, she turned and saw herself nebulous, but most distinct to her own
  view, and she noted the pale gold of the hair, and the fixed, wide, blue eyes
  as she had never noted them. Was she like that? Did Paul so see her?...</p>

  <p>Paul was not in his room; there was no light about the coach-house. One of
  the fierce watch-dogs came and sniffed and observed her silently, squatting
  on his haunches, coming and going in the flashes horribly, like a spectre in
  a witch's cavern. Paul was not there, nor anywhere about the premises. <i>He
  was not there</i>. She tried the doors: locked. She called his name; she
  cried out, turning her face to the sky, 'He is not there!' Taking the knife
  from its hiding-place, she held it out blankly in her palm as if in a madness
  she summoned him to answer.</p>

  <p>The lightning threw the coach-house into a sudden flare, mocking her like
  a diabolical smile; in the crash of thunder she threw herself upon the lock,
  wrestling with it, shouting, 'Paul! Paul!'</p>

  <p>He was not there. The dog came sniffing to her side. She spoke to
  it&mdash;' He's gone!'&mdash;and as she stooped and revealed her face the
  creature showed his fangs at it with a half-snarl as though he would have
  sprung. He followed as she turned, halting only at the end of his beat.
  Daphne felt his eyes through the dark as she crawled and ran now as though
  through water, as though every limb were leaded; now before fire, as though
  flames darted behind her; and so back to the house.</p>

  <p>Gisberne met her in the entry.</p>

  <p>'Well?'&mdash;he swiftly took the waterproof from round her and stooped to
  remove her shoes&mdash;' well?'</p>

  <p>'He is not there,' said Daphne.</p>

  <p>Gisberne motioned towards the body. 'I've done what I could. It's no use.
  He's done for.'</p>

  <p>They went together back into the room. The figure, inert, yet seemed to
  greet them. Daphne clutched Gisberne's arm. 'You have not had time for much,'
  she said, agonized. 'You are quite sure?'</p>

  <p>'Miss Daphne, if it was <i>your</i> life depending on it, it would be no
  use...He's dead.'</p>

  <p>Gisberne spoke in his pleasant way, softly, with the kind, quiet, everyday
  look of his brown eyes directed gravely upon the imperiously quiet figure. He
  was concerned for her&mdash;concerned for her sake that this fact was so, but
  the fact would seem to touch him not more nearly. His pallor had not gone; he
  was nerved, however, cool and steady.</p>

  <p>But Daphne, gazing, felt her face change and wither as though fingers
  crept there, drawing it together.</p>

  <p>'How did it happen?' she said. And her lips and tongue were strange
  instruments she found it difficult to use.</p>

  <p>'Well, Miss Daphne, I imagine he'd been drinking, and he stumbled and
  fell, and the rest was easy to anyone whose blood was up. I'm sorry Mr.
  Paul's cleared out, though there wasn't anything else to do once he'd left
  that knife and his fury cooled.'</p>

  <p>'The knife didn't do it,' she whispered.</p>

  <p>'No; just a freak of rage. Miss Daphne. Ferriby was dead already, I take
  it&mdash;smothered, strangled...See'&mdash;Gisberne picked up the candle and
  held it down over the head, and the flame brought out faintly fingermarks
  upon the throat&mdash;'they got at it in there alone, and&mdash;' Gisberne
  set the light down again, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

  <p>The pricking, ice-cold fingers were still playing over Daphne's face; they
  seemed now to be fumbling for her heart, to find it and crush it, scrolling
  it up like a leaf. She moaned in the intolerable agony, not knowing she did,
  holding herself rigid, staring upon Ferriby.</p>

  <p>'Miss Daphne, bear up now. I guess we can manage,' said Gisberne's voice
  in her ear. 'Will you trust it to me?'</p>

  <p>She turned, holding her hands to her heart; and the kindness in his eyes
  loosened its agony enough for her to breathe.</p>

  <p>'He's a young fool to have lit out,' said Gisberne, 'for he couldn't tell
  I should turn up to square things for him. Now, there's no desperate mark
  here.' He made a movement towards the body. 'I fancy those fingerings won't
  count for much by morning. It will pass muster that Mr. Ferriby came to his
  death by accident.' He paused, studying her face. 'You'd like that, wouldn't
  you?' he asked gently. 'You'd rather Mr. Paul didn't get called to account
  for this?'</p>

  <p>She looked the word...Gisberne nodded.</p>

  <p>'It's murder&mdash;yes, I'm afraid so.'</p>

  <p>'Hush! Hush!' She started and looked round. Gisberne spoke below his
  breath, but the echo seemed a shout. Again she looked&mdash;again Gisberne
  understood.</p>

  <p>'Miss Daphne, I don't know. Mr. Paul might get off at penal servitude,
  taking it as manslaughter under provocation. He might be&mdash;hanged.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Daphne, 'no.'</p>

  <p>'You don't want that? Not likely you do. Well then, you'll leave it to
  me.'</p>

  <p>'What are you going to do?'</p>

  <p>'Well, Miss Daphne, we'll have to transport him to the yard. It's a night
  for anything, in your favour entirely. I'm afraid I'll have to get your help
  so far...The rest you leave to me.'</p>

  <p>Daphne backed from the bed, the loose hair rising round her
  temples.&mdash;' You...won't hurt him?'</p>

  <p>'Hurt him!' Gisberne started as though the dead man, not she, had moved.
  He snatched up the light and held it to the bed, and a flicker went over the
  settling features as of a smile. Gisberne kept his face turned away a moment,
  then went back to her more quietly.</p>

  <p>'You want Mr. Paul got out of this?' he breathed.</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'At any price?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Then&mdash;you must give me a free hand.'</p>

  <p>'I can't have him hurt.' She pointed to the dead and shook in a transport
  of horror. 'Not hurt, no bruises...I can't...' she clung to the bed-post. 'We
  will call someone.' There was a silence between the three&mdash;yes, the
  three, for Ferriby began to count as though he lived. Gisberne glanced from
  one to the other reflectively.</p>

  <p>'Well, that's just as you like,' he said very gently. 'It mayn't save Mr.
  Paul's neck either way.' He looked at his watch.&mdash;' Half-past eleven.
  Well now, who'll you call, Miss Daphne?'</p>

  <p>She looked at him silently.</p>

  <p>'You're <i>not</i> going to call anyone! Well, it's the best way to serve
  Mr. Paul&mdash;the best way you can think of, just as I think of no better
  one to serve you...You're ready, then?'</p>

  <p>'Yes...'</p>

  <p>Gisberne drew a deep breath, bracing himself for the tremendous. 'Put
  those wraps on again,' he commanded. 'And get down some more. Now, by your
  leave.' He turned with a little air to the dead man, and at the same instant
  detained Daphne by a hand on her shoulder. 'There'll be no hurt done,' he
  said; 'have no fear.'</p>

  <p>Daphne bent in sudden impulse over the body. 'John!' she cried under her
  breath, 'John!' She stretched a hand out as if to touch him, to take away the
  withered rose...</p>

  <p>Gisberne caught her back. 'Leave all that,' he breathed beside her. He
  drew her away. 'Be quick,' he whispered, 'be quick. It's a different business
  to the last&mdash;the carrying, I mean. Hurry now! Suppose Miss Garth came
  down...'</p>

  <p>Daphne wrapped herself again in the waterproof and put on the shoes.
  Gisberne improvised a stout support which he passed under the dead man's arms
  and over his own head. Not without scuffling and stumbling, they lifted him
  from the bed and carried the dead weight into the open, leaving a darkened
  room and a house echoing to storm, fit orchestration for the scene.</p>

  <p>It was a slow and desperate progress. Within the gate of the second yard
  were the huge flaps of an outside cellarage and store-room. Here was
  Gisberne's destination. 'Set him down,' he whispered pantingly. For a long
  minute he and Daphne stood erect, caring only to breathe. Gisberne groaned at
  the stabs through his choking lungs. A stealthy pattering, strangely audible
  through the downpour of the rain, was coming swiftly nearer&mdash;one of the
  dogs!</p>

  <p>'Keep him off!' cried Gisberne, starting into action again with a sudden
  touch of panic.</p>

  <p>Daphne called the creature's name. It knew her too well for sound or
  opposition&mdash;the watch-dogs of the Grange were silent or&mdash;were
  deadly. She stooped to it and felt the wet bristles stiffening and the
  dribbling jaws drop with instinct to howl, and the horror of what she was
  doing touched her in hideous sympathy. She, too, could have dropped to the
  ground and raised her face and howled aloud on high.</p>

  <p>Gisberne spoke from his place fiercely. 'There is no time to lose,' he
  urged. 'The storm is breaking&mdash;go back to the house. I must do the rest
  alone...No, wait!' He touched her with wet hands, cold as ice. 'How does the
  flap open, Miss Daphne? You know, perhaps better than I do.' Much of his
  coolness seemed gone. She helped him with the bolts of the flap, helped him
  to lift it and set it open. Then he drove her away. 'Wait in the porch,' he
  said. 'Don't bedraggle the house again with wet.'</p>

  <p>Ferriby was at their feet, wraps huddled over him-Gisberne's forethought
  that the body should not be too drenched. The open space yawned&mdash;a
  willing grave, Gisberne's plan too plain. Daphne swayed forward, wringing her
  hands.</p>

  <p>'We will not! We will not!' she gasped.</p>

  <p>'Oh, come, you mustn't begin that now!' Gisberne put her back feverishly,
  trembling violently. 'Get away! Get away&mdash;I'll do the rest. Stop it.
  Miss Daphne, or my heart 'll burst...If we don't watch it, it won't be saving
  Mr. Paul: it'll be destruction to us all.'</p>

  <p>She left him with the body...She made her way back to the porch. A fearful
  fancy took her that Irene Garth, awake and watchful, might have come down,
  and be awaiting her to question and discover. She reached the house, entered,
  and everything was as she had left it. Not heeding Gisberne's injunctions,
  but desirous rather to forestall his orders, and what he might think
  requisite, she began to be busy&mdash;getting a light, and putting back into
  its own exact semblance the room from which Ferriby had been carried. Relief
  gradually possessed her <i>to see no one on the bed</i>. She straightened the
  stiff coverlet. That that had lain there seemed to have been taken away
  long&mdash;immeasurably long&mdash;ago. She looked the floor over carefully,
  not quite clear why, but to anticipate Gisberne's desiring it. A big amber
  bead lay near the threshold. Picking it up, Daphne knew it to be from Irene
  Garth's necklace. It conveyed no more to her than that Irene had broken the
  necklace, and a bead had rolled in here. She stood staring at it in her palm,
  and, as if the bead had been a crystal and she mesmerized, she felt herself
  caught away, away, away, till a very ecstasy of love possessed her.</p>

  <p>'Paul! Paul! Oh, my love! It is I who will have saved you and no
  other&mdash;not Irene: she sleeps while you escape. I am saving you&mdash;I,
  and no other!'</p>

  <p>For a breath the warmth of it transformed her, and turned the blackness to
  a summer day, and Paul's face smiled. Then she was aware of a stealthy
  movement&mdash;Robert Gisberne had got back.</p>

  <p>He was exhausted to the point of swooning, and trembling with hysteria;
  but the effect of it was still of something wholly impersonal, something for
  her.</p>

  <p>'Half-past twelve,' he got out: 'we've been quick.'</p>

  <p>Quick! Devil Ferriby could have echoed that. It was striking ten as he
  turned in at the gate. They had been quick.</p>

  <p>'Now, if Mr. Paul has any sense,' said Gisberne, leaning heavily against
  the wall, 'he'll come back when he hears what's happened and explain his
  absence to-night, or make out he's never been away. You have that
  knife&mdash;stick to it...Mr. Devil Ferriby was drunk&mdash;that's not a
  startling fact&mdash;and, fooling round the yards in his man's absence, he
  pitched head downwards and&mdash;there it is. You know nothing of that. Miss
  Daphne. Say, if you like, you came down and looked round, thought everything
  was quiet, and went back...That will cover the waterproof and shoes.'</p>

  <p>'And you?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'I'm starting now for Droitlet&mdash;I've not been near you. Take your
  skirt, Miss Daphne. These other wraps must go for what they are. If there's
  any question, you used them, going in and out, listening and uneasy. Of
  course, we mayn't bring it off for Mr. Paul yet. I don't know how you're
  going to work it with him. It may pan out yet that they think he threw him
  down; but I rather fancy there's no fear...Now, you get to your room. Miss
  Daphne...It'll be bad for you for an hour or two, I'm afraid&mdash;wish I
  could help you there...' His voice broke. 'Miss Daphne, have I been any
  use?'</p>

  <p>And she, standing close to him in the doorway of the room,
  empty&mdash;that would be the sense of this room to Daphne Estorel,
  henceforth, always, its emptiness-heard the choke in his throat, and his head
  bowed itself down against her arm. She heard him mutter, exculpating himself,
  shaken, done. She herself shook with the force of upspringing tears that
  could not flow.</p>

  <p>'Don't! don't!' she gasped.</p>

  <p>'I've been of some use, eh?' he muttered again, and then he stood erect,
  unsteadily. 'Don't take any notice of me. Miss Daphne; I&mdash;I&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He turned about, and made ready to depart.</p>

  <p>Daphne looked at him, the ordinary yet lithe, good figure, the commonplace
  bearing, the everyday face and kindly manner marking him even now as he
  busied himself finally.</p>

  <p>As Macbeth with 'Amen,' the words 'Thank you' for such help as his stuck
  in her throat.</p>

  <p>'It doesn't matter about taking this candle back,' said Gisberne; 'it will
  look more natural set down here. You take your taper. Now, I hate to leave
  you, but it's safest. Shall I come with you across the kitchen?'</p>

  <p>'You can't go out in all this storm,' she said.</p>

  <p>'Oh, don't mind me.' Strange was this little exchange of concern between
  them, both wet and wretched, spent as though from running hard, the breath
  coming badly between their pallid lips. Gisberne put the taper into her
  hands. 'Best go. Miss Daphne,' he said. 'We must leave it now to what
  befalls...Are you frightened?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>He noiselessly opened the door into the living-room and held it back for
  her. As she passed him, the taper lighting up her wanness and bedraggled
  golden hair, she turned her head and put her ice-cold lips to his chilled
  damp cheek.</p>

  <p>He made no response in word or movement.</p>

  <p>She crossed the room, opened the door, and, in the doorway, looked back at
  him, shown by her taper-gleam dimly. Then the doors closed simultaneously and
  without a sound.</p>

  <p>Gisberne stepped swiftly to the row of wraps. From under a heavy ulster of
  Welsh cloth he lifted Irene Garth's blue garment. In one of the loose sleeves
  were knotted a number of amber beads. The flimsy silk and cambric went into a
  small flat compass, and when Gisberne left, a moment later, he had it
  buttoned securely beneath his vest.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Daphne's arms hung by her side like ropes of lead. She kept wondering to
  herself why she could scarcely lift them, and then remembering she had been
  carrying Devil Ferriby.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2"
     id="ch-2"></a>PART II.&mdash;MAN'S ADJUSTMENT</h2>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-1"
     id="ch-2-1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">Lawyer Winch was speaking. His voice fell upon a
hush&mdash;the hush at a
  graveside when the parson reads the Burial Service clearly into the live air
  and the human being's soul shrinks into silence.</p>

  <p>It was the living-room of the Grange, and the lawyer sat in the stately
  and ancient arm-chair near the bureau. Facing him was Mistress Skidfell,
  unchanged to look upon, grim, rigid, and watchful.</p>

  <p>Every one of the household was there, indrawn upon themselves in that
  sharp guard of the mind on any betrayal by the body that is a man's most
  delicately wonderful achievement.</p>

  <p>In the deep window-sill sat Paul Ferriby, his head thrown back against the
  frame of the open casement. Daphne, in a black muslin that showed her 'arms
  and neck, sat near Jane, and, opposite to her, drawn to the table, was Irene.
  She was in pure white; her elbows rested on the table; her forehead was bowed
  upon her hands. By the door, closed behind them, was grouped the meagre
  household, dressed in black, that had a pathetic appearance, being a badge,
  not a tribute, and by so much the more expressive. Sophy stood by Scarside;
  behind them the three stout kitchen-wenches.</p>

  <p>Anyone looking at Sophy and remembering her would have looked again. She
  appeared to have grown; her face showed both a new attraction and a new
  hardness. Her gaze alone now and then stealthily wandered from the lawyer to
  Irene Garth.</p>

  <p>It was late afternoon, a month since Devil Ferriby's death. All shine in
  the light had long gone from the low room; the air was still hot with the
  closeness of it, of August dusk.</p>

  <p>Lawyer Winch, an old man, pleasant to look on and vigorous, a reminder of
  bygone fashions in his dress and bearing, looked round upon his company.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Ferriby, sir, and you. Miss Garth,' he said, poising his gold-rimmed
  glasses and rising from preparatory remarks into sudden firmness and poise,
  'Mistress Jane Skidfell has asked me over here to-day to tell you her mind.
  It is a private gathering. I'm here rather as the man whom John Ferriby's
  father trusted than as the co-executor of his will. What I have to say.
  Mistress Skidfell bids me tell you, is meant for your ears alone. The time,
  delayed by circumstances unusually long, has come, at last, to state openly
  that your cousin, so unhappily deceased, left no will.' He paused, glancing
  at the little group by the door. 'I am instructed, however, to tell you, the
  members of his household, that you will be remembered, and as suitably as if
  your master had lived his full time or you served your full limit. This by
  Mistress Skidfell's wish.'</p>

  <p>Daphne Estorel glanced round with the sudden movement of the hand to her
  bosom. Something clutched her heart, forcing the desire to laugh or cry
  aloud. Bequests to these! This absurd little group the last of a Ferriby's
  household! It was the culmination of some wrong surely, that this should be
  so. A wrong self-inflicted by the dead! These gaping rustics <i>all</i> his
  household!</p>

  <p>'Details will be duly given you,' continued Lawyer Winch. And Jane
  Skidfell made a motion that they-the retainers of the Grange&mdash;could now
  retire. Sophy went reluctantly, the last, casting a look towards Irene.</p>

  <p>'Now,' resumed the lawyer instantly, 'to state the fact once more: John
  Ferriby, lately and unhappily deceased, left no will.'</p>

  <p>Irene looked up. 'Why do you talk of him?' she said...'I can't bear it.'
  And she half rose, her face white, her eyes wild.</p>

  <p>'There will be very little more of it, Miss Garth.' Lawyer Winch spoke
  with marked kindliness. He waited a breath, and Irene sank back into her seat
  and resumed her former attitude. 'It is of your uncle we must speak,'
  continued the lawyer, 'known also as Devil Ferriby. By his will coming now
  again into force, and which I shall presently proceed to read to you, he,
  Cornelius Ferriby, appoints Daphne Estorel, here present, his sole heiress
  should his only son and issue die unmarried...'</p>

  <p>Paul moved, lapsed an instant again into immobility, then roused himself
  as if words were in waiting and must come. Daphne sat back in her chair, and
  the change about her was plain. Her colouring was deeper-hued&mdash;the gold
  of her hair, the pink of the lips, the light and shade of her eyes; her form
  was rounded into a new fullness. She looked at Jane with breath, it would
  seem, suspended. Irene Garth, lifting her head, looked at her.</p>

  <p>'I would have you all now listen attentively,' said Lawyer Winch. 'Ferriby
  Grange is a lonely place, and, leading too solitary a life here, the Ferribys
  have grown eccentric. Your Grandfather Ferriby did some strange things. He
  had three children: your mother, Miss Garth; your father, Mr. Paul; and your
  uncle. It was your grandfather's fancy to plead poverty. He kept the Grange
  up miserably. Your father and your mother. Miss Garth and Mr. Paul, grew
  tired of it, and went their way into the world. The eldest son, Mr. John's
  father, stayed by the stuff, like the good son in the parable...'</p>

  <p>'Thee'll amend that, lawyer,' said Jane quietly, looking up.</p>

  <p>'He was utterly unlike any good son in any parable, but, I repeat it, he
  stayed by the stuff,' said Lawyer Winch. He and Jane regarded each other a
  moment. Winch continued calmly: 'And the stuff accumulated, and so did your
  grandfather's partiality for his firstborn, till, shortly before his death,
  he made over by deed of gift the greater&mdash;by far the greater&mdash;part
  of a large fortune to this eldest son. The matter was kept a secret between
  them, with no reason for it save the eccentricity I referred to. Subsequently
  a will was drawn up, dividing the remainder&mdash;I am bound to add, the
  comparatively very small remainder&mdash;of the property into three equal
  portions.'</p>

  <p>Irene started up. She flung out a hand towards Jane. 'You called us
  charity-brats,' she cried&mdash;' Paul and me; and you knew, you <i>knew</i>
  how we were being cheated!'</p>

  <p>'Cheated! No, Miss Garth,' struck in the lawyer. 'A man may do as he will
  with his own.'</p>

  <p>'And Ferriby is left to Daphne Estorel!' screamed Irene. 'Paul, you will
  dispute it...'</p>

  <p>Paul rose and came forward. 'I see you know there <i>is</i> no disputing
  it, Mr. Winch,' he said. 'May we hear the will?'</p>

  <p>As Paul stood, one hand resting on the table, he was nearer to Daphne than
  to Irene Garth. In that low room he seemed to tower. There was no slouch
  visible about him now. He had shaken off the weight of the soil and the drag
  down of the plough. His eyes were steady and uncompromising, the mouth firm
  and as if for very little it could be cruel. The old lawyer glanced up at him
  furtively, with that tribute of admiration that might easily turn to
  malignancy, the envy of age so handicaps its kindliness.</p>

  <p>'Read the will,' said Jane.</p>

  <p>The lawyer read aloud, Paul still standing, Daphne gazing as before on
  Jane, Irene staring at her. From a certain change, indefinable but there,
  breathed out every breath from the three of them, it was evident some strain
  was loosened&mdash;something that had caused it set aside. New and astounding
  feelings had been stirred, and were for the moment supreme. They had
  forgotten Devil Ferriby's death in listening to what had come of it.</p>

  <p>The lawyer read out in language startlingly clear the will of Cornelius
  Ferriby. Should his son John Ferriby die unmarried, before the age of forty,
  Ferriby Grange and all Ferriby Grange represented was to become the property
  of Daphne Estorel. This, with so few words wasted upon it that it stood out
  like a challenge, was the whole of it&mdash;Daphne Estorel had all!</p>

  <p>'And who is Daphne Estorel?' cried Paul, as the lawyer finished reading,
  and looked up over his gold-rimmed glasses, his delicate yellow and wrinkled
  hand falling softly as a gentle finale upon the document he had laid down.
  'Who is Daphne Estorel?' Irene's eyes echoed the question with a blaze of
  hate, Daphne endorsed it voicelessly, rising to her full height, her bosom
  swelling. Lawyer Winch, with the narrowed face of one who is looking back too
  far almost to see, studied the three faces. Jane Skidfell made ready to
  speak.</p>

  <p>'Who is Daphne Estorel?' said Lawyer Winch. 'You mean, Mr. Paul, in
  relation to your grandfather's will. Yes, yes, I understand that. Who is Miss
  Estorel? An unanswerable question. I do not know.'</p>

  <p>'She is that woman's daughter!' cried Irene, with the laugh of a
  vindictive triumph&mdash;' a servant's daughter!'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Lawyer Winch abruptly. Then he paused as if he had said too
  much, and glanced at Mistress Skidfell.</p>

  <p>'No,' said Jane, with strange quiet. 'Thee hast not much discernment,
  Irene Garth. Neither mine nor any servant's daughter.'</p>

  <p>'Who is she?' repeated Paul. His voice rang out, giving the question every
  iota of meaning.</p>

  <p>With a strange stillness about the movement. Daphne resumed her seat. Jane
  lifted her hand finely towards the lawyer. 'Your Grandfather Ferriby, Mr.
  Paul,' said Winch, obeying the gesture, 'had a step-brother. The step-brother
  married. The issue of that marriage was one daughter, by name Daphne. In this
  daughter your Uncle Cornelius was interested. He told me so much himself. The
  young lady lived abroad, and married abroad, presumably. Miss Estorel, here
  present, is the child of that union, and, seemingly, was accepted as a sacred
  trust from your grandfather by your uncle. In his will he makes her his
  conditional heiress. The conditions occurring, Miss Estorel succeeds to the
  property. I can say no more, for I know no more. Mistress Skidfell is not
  better informed. There is no mystery. Miss Estorel's parentage is easily
  traceable. Your uncle's interest in her had something in it, no doubt, of the
  superstition the Ferribys show in treating each other's peculiarities. If you
  could discover why your grandfather was interested in&mdash;his-stepbrother's
  child, then you would know a great deal, Mr. Paul&mdash;much more than I do,
  or anyone living, and still not be able to alter this will by one jot or
  tittle.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, we can understand,' cried Irene. 'Grandfather Ferriby&mdash;his
  step-brother's wife, his m&mdash;' She stopped as if someone had clapped a
  hand on her mouth, then, cowering in her seat, stared at the others as one
  who has let slip a clue, and waits aghast to see it recognized.</p>

  <p>But the moment passed her by. Jane looked up commandingly. 'That is t'
  master's written will and testament,' she said; 'but, when he came to die, he
  spoke into my ear. "Let a Ferriby rule at Ferriby," he said. He wor t'
  master.' Her voice sank, and the glance of her withered eyes fell upon the
  ring upon her withered hand. Then she looked up at Paul.&mdash;' Thou art a
  Ferriby,' she said. 'Wilt thou stay here and step into thy dead cousin's
  shoes?'</p>

  <p>Lawyer Winch, glancing up as if to speak, refrained. Jane Skidfell rose,
  inspired. 'Dar'st thou stay here, my lad?' she said, with a Sybillic
  utterance, her rigid form kindling. 'The place is hers '&mdash;she pointed to
  Daphne&mdash;' but this is between thee and me and t' master...Dar'st thou
  stay here? Wilt thou? Thou hast been serving here six years&mdash;for what?'
  The old woman leant upon the table. Paul, opposite, eyed her with a bitter
  smile. 'Art thou t' stuff to go <i>on</i> serving here till thy serving is a
  master's service, and thy obedience law? Then is Ferriby thine&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'And I take it,' said Paul swiftly, lifting his hand. 'On those terms. I
  take it.'</p>

  <p>Lawyer Winch moved delicately. 'This is, of course, beside the original
  mark,' he said, with a deferential little cough. 'Such matters rest with Miss
  Estorel&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Nay! nay!' struck in Jane, as if exultant.</p>

  <p>'No doubt everything will adjust itself,' pursued the lawyer.</p>

  <p>'Paul,' broke in a gasping whisper from Irene, 'you will dispute this
  will?'</p>

  <p>He looked at her as if he did not know her, and turned back to the others.
  'I stay here,' he said. 'I take up Jane Skidfell's challenge. I make Ferriby
  mine, or it goes ill with Ferriby.'</p>

  <p>'That sounds like a threat, Mr. Paul,' remarked the lawyer dryly.</p>

  <p>'You all hear me make it,' was the answer. 'My uncle's treachery, his
  devilish deception&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Be careful, ma lad,' struck in Jane. 'He wor t' master&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'He was a villain, and the maker of an unjust will,' said Paul, with
  uplifted voice. 'It has cried out like blood for vengeance. It has had it! It
  will have it!...You, Miss Estorel, have you anything
  to&mdash;say-to&mdash;me?'</p>

  <p>There was no weakening nor change, only a curious faltering on the last
  words. He looked straight at Daphne, she at him.</p>

  <p>'Jane speaks,' she said.</p>

  <p>'Then you are witness, Lawyer Winch,' cried Paul, turning from her
  instantly. 'I have been serving here&mdash;I, a Ferriby&mdash;six years, for
  one thing. I have been a strange fool! I will go on serving here with another
  object now, and perhaps not showing myself quite such a fool. I <i>stay</i>!
  Ferriby for a Ferriby!'</p>

  <p>'Unguarded! most unguarded!' muttered Lawyer Winch; but his accent was
  applause.</p>

  <p>Paul turned to the door. Irene, starting with a cry, got there first, and
  barred his way. 'And what about me?' she gasped. 'Me, Paul!
  me&mdash;Irene?'</p>

  <p>For answer, Paul, towering and uplifted, looked at her again, as if he
  asked who she might be, put her aside and went out; and they saw him the next
  instant, upright, fierce in his bearing, passing the long casement on his way
  to the yards. Irene, huddled against the door on to her stairway, rested her
  arm upon the latch, and, putting her face down, began to sob and moan.
  'Cousin John, come back, come back! I want you. Cousin John! Oh, Cousin
  John!' The lawyer winced. The cry seemed to call forth the disdainful silence
  of the grave. 'Cousin John, Cousin John!' and no answer.</p>

  <p>But when Daphne, wan, trembling, with a cold tenderness, approached, Irene
  turned on her in snarling fury, and, beating her off, rushed up the stairs,
  flinging the door wide behind her.</p>

  <p>Daphne, closing it again, leant there almost as Irene Garth had done, her
  head bowed and face hidden, her cry ascending not from the lips but from the
  soul.</p>

  <p>Some moments of utter silence followed, and then everyday matters were
  again in motion. Sounds were audible from without, the twitter of the
  sparrows, voices outside, the buzz of a machine. Lawyer Winch wiped his
  glasses.</p>

  <p>'Well?' he said softly. 'Well, Mrs. Skidfell?'</p>

  <p>'I have set a-going a man,' answered Jane grimly, pointing towards the
  window Paul had passed. 'Ferriby for a Ferriby, that wor t' master's word in
  my ear when he came to die&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'He should have written it down,' said Lawyer Winch, with a glance towards
  Daphne. 'It would have saved trouble.'</p>

  <p>'Aye,' answered Jane, 'and cheated t' Grange of a man;' and again she
  pointed to the window through which they had just seen Paul, upright and
  fierce.</p>

  <p>'Ah!' sighed the lawyer, 'ah, indeed!' He began to gather his papers
  together.</p>

  <p>Gradually every trace of inspiration faded from Jane Skidfell's face. She
  sank into her seat, an old woman, bowed and sorrowful.</p>

  <p>'Bloodshed!' she muttered, rocking herself. ''Tis come. An' he wor' t'
  master's son. T' master's son! I'm fain to echo that miserable lass's cry.
  I'm fain to see his face again.' Her face sharpened and paled to a livid hue.
  'I'm loath his death should go unavenged,' she whispered.</p>

  <p>'It's poor work calling the <i>Almighty</i> to account,' said the lawyer
  expressively.</p>

  <p>Jane looked up at him, and as the dimmed, keen, envious old eyes met, his
  and hers. Lawyer Winch stooped.</p>

  <p>'Hold to the evidence of the jury. Mistress Skidfell,' he said: '"A fall
  in the dark; accidental; a broken neck." Hold to that for the sake of the old
  name...Don't let your wits wander. Is that my room, dame?' he added, as
  Daphne turned towards them. He pointed to the one across the entry, and with
  an old-fashioned bow that became his bearing well, and looking a sadder and
  an older man now that he moved, he departed slowly, leaving Daphne and Jane
  together.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-2"
     id="ch-2-2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">The girl flung herself by the old woman's side. 'Who am I?'
she
  said.&mdash;' Who am I? A Ferriby?'</p>

  <p>'Wouldst thou be one?' asked Jane, touching her hair.</p>

  <p>Daphne shrank from the touch, shaking herself free. 'No, no!' she cried.
  'But I shall keep it.' She sprang again to her feet. 'Don't ask me to give up
  anything. It <i>is</i> mine?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, lass, thine.'</p>

  <p>'Then I keep it, every stick and stone and every farthing!' And Daphne
  stood expanding over the old servant's grim and withered dignity, like some
  goddess that has burst bonds, and needs to, and will take the whole of space
  for room. She pressed her hand on her bosom. Her beauty leapt forth as from
  behind a veil. 'Am I a Ferriby?' she demanded again.</p>

  <p>'I cannot tell thee,' said Jane, surveying her. 'I do not know.'</p>

  <p>'You can swear that to me, Jane? You do not know?'</p>

  <p>'Aye, I can swear it. I do not know.'</p>

  <p>Daphne threw back her head with a sound like laughter. 'If <i>you</i> do
  not know, then <i>I</i> never shall,' she said; 'but I shall keep what has
  come to me.' She stooped and took Jane's shoulder. 'Did you want me to give
  it up to Paul? I shall not.'</p>

  <p>Jane rose and faced her. 'I have cared for thee, my lass,' she said, Mike
  my own, but not because I took thee from thy dead mother's side, but because
  <i>t' master sent me</i> for thee. I spoke just now to Paul Ferriby because
  t' master's words ha' never left me. I ha' cared for you, I ha' had kind
  thoughts o' Paul, but that's gone by wi' the death o' t' master's son! T'
  master's son!' Her voice rose into a keening cry. 'T 'master's son! I turn
  from all of ye. Ferriby for a Ferriby. T' master said it, an' I ha' passed it
  on. Thou'lt keep it, an' Paul will have it. Fit it together as ye please. I
  turn from all of ye.' She lifted her hands in an apostrophe of grief, locking
  them above her head. 'Ride again past yon window, my lad, my master's son!'
  she wailed. 'Stride across t' threshold once more, my lad! Fight out o' t'
  grave!...Mr. John! Mr. John! t' master's son!...'</p>

  <p>Daphne drew back from her with bated breath. Slowly the old woman's hands
  dropped, slowly her whole body sank together. At the kitchen door she turned
  and, her withered hand resting on the latch, the ring showing large on the
  shrivelling finger, looked across at Daphne. 'The place is thine,' she
  said.</p>

  <p>'Thou'lt order it as thee likes.'</p>

  <p>Daphne sprang to her side. 'You won't desert me, Aunt Jane?' she said
  passionately. 'You won't go?'</p>

  <p>Jane Skidfell smiled&mdash;a smile that scorned the thought. 'From here!
  Nay, nay. But I turn from all of ye. Thee mayst very well <i>be</i> a
  Ferriby, Daphne'&mdash;the old eyes fixed her with a heart-reading
  look&mdash;'bad strain and all.' And she went out. Daphne, darting at the
  closing latch, caught and made it come down noiselessly. It had become a
  habit with her. She could not bear the click of the latches of these doors,
  rising or falling. Leaning against the woodwork, she surveyed the room,
  dusk-filled, close, no air stirring. An expansion of feeling possessed her
  that was both sublime and terrible. Ferriby was hers, money was hers, the
  largeness was hers of the meaning of the words&mdash;<i>to he able</i>. She
  was not astounded by the news of her inheritance. It came as the natural
  solution of her quietude of mind and body. She had been held in
  waiting&mdash;and for this. Now the soul in her strained to the uttermost
  bounds. Let Paul Ferriby draw never so large a circle, she could draw one
  larger, and still encompass him. Bad&mdash;was she? Daphne laughed to herself
  with her hand to her throat, glorying, trembling. She must needs be bad. She
  must needs take every iota her new position offered. She must needs search
  earth and hell for impulse, for <i>heaven</i> had gone. The serene silence of
  Daphne Estorel's love had vanished. Her feeling for Paul was beyond
  herself&mdash;a whirlwind of enmity, of desire to hurt, of fierce resentment,
  a passion to fight and tear, to overmaster him, convict, destroy. Ferriby was
  hers. And he would stay and <i>serve</i> in order to make it his. Daphne's
  blood leapt to the encounter...</p>

  <p>She looked across the dusk of the room to the place where Devil Ferriby
  had lain, prone and huge. Such a transport of emotion seized this girl, this
  woman from whom silence had been struck as the clay from the bronze, that she
  clasped herself in her own arms to stay it. Life had begun&mdash;in exultant
  hatred of Paul Ferriby. It included pity, too, and comprehension of Irene
  Garth.</p>

  <p>Daphne threw open the kitchen door. 'Is Sophy there?' she called. Sophy
  came running, pale, sharp-eyed, her fresh and decent lips spoiling themselves
  fast by compression. She looked at Miss Daphne, catching her breath.</p>

  <p>'Go up to Miss Garth,' said Daphne. 'She may need you. Where is
  Scarside?'</p>

  <p>'Outside, Miss Daphne.'</p>

  <p>'He is to carry logs into the dining-hall and light a fire. When you leave
  Miss Garth lay supper there, Sophy, on the table under the stained glass. I
  will take the head, Mistress Skidfell the foot. Lay for Mr. Paul one side.
  Miss Garth the other. Silver in plenty, Sophy, lights, no flowers.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, miss,' muttered Sophy. She fell back, staring at her&mdash;staring
  at the whiteness under the black&mdash;staring at the golden hair, the full,
  slightly smiling lips. This was Miss Daphne! And her poor, dear Miss 'Rene!
  Putting the two together it was like thought of sunrise, as the Cockney girl
  knew it now, turning to sickliness the city lights. Sophy's heart beat fast
  as she ran up to Miss 'Rene's room. If Miss Daphne was going to begin to look
  like that, if the saint was going to throw off her mantle, the statue step
  down from above the church door&mdash;if a miracle was going to happen, then
  what about Miss 'Rene?<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Irene lay along the couch on which she had wept the night of Ferriby's
  first kiss, the night he had first kissed her on the mouth. Sophy had left
  her, lighting her lamp and candles and telling her the news of supper in the
  dining-hall. She had glanced on Miss Irene's drawn face, and forborne to
  speak her thought of Miss Daphne's transformation. But Irene had noticed it.
  'She has got everything, Sophy,' she said. 'I'm dependent on her
  charity&mdash;and because Cousin John died un married.'</p>

  <p>Sophy Bassett's eyes at this had met Irene's strangely. Irene's eyes
  spoke.</p>

  <p>'Lor'! Miss 'Rene,' said Sophy, whispering, 'you could never have put in
  any claim&mdash;you could never have managed it. Oh, my dear, you be thankful
  you're so well out of it, Miss 'Rene. The days and nights I've had...'</p>

  <p>'I <i>should</i> have been married to him by now,' said Irene. She drew
  the girl down. 'We were fools to be so frightened. I've been asking myself
  ever since I came upstairs just now why we were so frightened. I was going to
  marry Cousin John...I could even have told them that that was why&mdash;that
  it had gone so far between us that...'</p>

  <p>'Now, Miss 'Rene,' said Sophy, white and stern, 'don't you begin no
  nonsense.'</p>

  <p>'I think I shall tell,' said Irene, half rising.</p>

  <p>'Oh no, you won't. Miss 'Rene. Lie down now; keep still, there's my dear
  young lady.'</p>

  <p>'But I should like them to know,' Irene struggled up, very quiet, and the
  more impressive. 'Perhaps...if they knew...they couldn't say anything. I
  would say&mdash;I could say I killed him for it...'</p>

  <p>'Miss 'Rene, you're mad!' Sophy spoke with authority, hardly earned, still
  barely rising above nervous terror.</p>

  <p>'Yes, I think I am. To see her like that! To know she has got the Grange!
  Yes, I think I am mad.'</p>

  <p>Sophy laid her back. 'You lie quiet till I come back. Miss 'Rene,' she
  said, 'and we'll talk it all over. You'll forget this after a bit, an' go
  away and marry, an', my gracious! you'll be glad you kept your mouth shut
  then, Miss 'Rene. There, take some of this...' With trembling fingers Sophy
  poured a wine-coloured liquid from a bottle bearing a chemist's name, and
  administered it with a finely stern air; but over the sharp, white features
  such a maternal solicitude and care were brooding as lifted and redeemed the
  scene.</p>

  <p>When Sophy had gone, Irene fell back on the couch. She and Daphne Estorel
  were to change places. Her portion now would be the quiet and the isolation
  and beauty eclipsed. She lay quite still. So may a person buried alive lie
  still, lest in moving he touch certainty. For Irene to move much in her
  thoughts would be to touch madness. Since Cousin John's death she had been
  ill, and recovered from illness only to fall into a terror, suggested and
  nursed by Sophy, and fraught with the first instincts of a girl's
  preservation. It had become an obsession. Once passed, she wondered at
  it...Why had she not spoken&mdash;why had she not told of her relations with
  him, and the scene that night? She could have excused herself...she could
  have worked it, possibly, to flout Daphne. Now, Daphne had the Grange
  and&mdash;money. Paul&mdash;ah, but she loathed Paul...and Cousin John was
  dead...actually buried...dead...<i>murdered</i>...Her thoughts, distracted by
  illness and personal fears, and kept suspended by the question of the
  disposal of the property, settled now, swerved violently to that main fact:
  <i>dead&mdash;murdered</i>. The word took shape, the shadowy likeness of a
  human form, and, it seemed to her, came to a place beside her on the couch
  and looked at her questioningly. Irene sat up slowly, staring. Impalpable,
  unrecognizable. Something stared back. Murdered! Yes, she knew that, and she
  knew by whom, and she said nothing. Strangely, but none the less actually for
  that, Irene Garth had succeeded in keeping remembrance of that night's work
  at bay, first in swooning shudderings, guarded by Sophy and put down to
  shock, then in illness and terror of the flesh and bated hopes and fears as
  to what might fall to her with the discovery of Cousin John's will.</p>

  <p>And there was no will! Daphne Estorel had everything, and Cousin John was
  dead, buried...murdered. And she had said nothing.</p>

  <p>Quite still Irene kept herself, staring at the Something that, faceless
  and formless, yet stared back.</p>

  <p>Gradually, not knowing that she put them there, she found her hands
  pressing her heart and sank back. A sick desire possessed her to be
  caressed...It passed or she must have died. She began to move now restlessly.
  Rising at length, it would seem by her movements her thoughts had cleared and
  steadied. She rearranged her hair and prepared to change her dress, and found
  herself whispering a name...<i>Robert Gisheme</i>. How did she stand
  towards...Robert Gisberne? What manner of man was Robert Gisberne?</p>

  <p>'Say anything you like to me,' Robert Gisberne once said. How would Robert
  Gisberne answer if she asked him what he had done with the blue wrap and the
  amber beads?</p>

  <p>Irene Garth's eyes began to shine, some colour to creep into her blanched
  face.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-3"
     id="ch-2-3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">Wonderful was the clear openness of the great stretch above
the moorland.
  Too early yet for clouds, ineffable was the purity of the faint blue,
  spreading so far it touched the sadness of distance and ringed the horizon
  with yearning.</p>

  <p>The milk-pans gleamed and glinted in the sunshine; a white rime still lay
  along the eaves. Sophy Bassett, shading her eyes with her hand, looked up
  from the smocked figure of Scarside, scouring busily, and her gaze searched
  the fields wistfully.</p>

  <p>'These here summer mornin's,' she said, with something of a sigh&mdash;' I
  never did see nothink like 'em, these 'ere mornin's&mdash;never.'</p>

  <p>'Don't have 'em in t' Harrer Road, do ye?' said Solomon.'</p>

  <p>'What o' Daisy and Dandy in t' cowslip meadow?' cried Sophy with abrupt
  change of thought, clothed in very fair Yorkshire speech. 'Thee hasna' forgot
  'em, Sol?'</p>

  <p>Scarside straightened himself with a ringing 'Ho! ho! Daisy and Dandy an'
  the cowslip meadow,' he mimicked. 'You do be comin' it. Plenty o' Solomon an'
  dew an' cows about ye now. We don't hear so much of the 'Arrer Road an' your
  young man. You've giv 'im up now yer've found I've got the brains to take 'im
  in!'</p>

  <p>'Stop that guffawin' now!' cried Sophy sharply. 'We don't want they
  wenches round us yet.'</p>

  <p>Solomon stopped scouring completely and looked at her with stolid
  satisfaction. 'Yer've got it pat,' he said. 'Ye talk better nor I do. I dunno
  wot's come to <i>my</i> talk since ye meddled wi' it.' He came nearer, his
  whole brawny figure softening. 'Tell me in good Yorksheer ye luv' me, Sophy,'
  he said.</p>

  <p>She clung to him suddenly. 'I'd hate to go, Solomon,' she answered,
  trembling.</p>

  <p>The great fellow looked down into the peaky pretty face. 'You bean't
  going,' he said. 'You be going to marry me.'</p>

  <p>Sophy nodded. 'If Miss 'Rene goes I shall have to go with her,
  Solomon.'</p>

  <p>Scarside stood considering the sharp, pale, wistful features. He fumbled
  with his thoughts, trying to force them beyond the point always recurring
  when he talked with Sophy, namely, that she was losing her colour and that
  there was something she and Miss Irene kept between them. Beyond this nothing
  was to be got at. Solomon's attacks were baffled continually by Sophy's turns
  and quickness of wit; but he seemed to see the way a bit clearer this
  morning.</p>

  <p>'Miss Daphne's going to make big changes,' he said finally. 'An' did yer
  know, Sophy, that Muster Gisberne wor back?'</p>

  <p>Sophy gave a great start. 'How d'ye know?' She stared at him.</p>

  <p>'I seed un,' said Scarside, 'as I druv' out o' Petsham yesterday.'</p>

  <p>'Now, what does <i>he</i> want here?' said Sophy.</p>

  <p>'I dunno. He wor always friends wi' Muster Paul.' Solomon glanced round to
  be sure 'Muster Paul' was nowhere in sight. 'Miss Daphne liked un too.'</p>

  <p>Sophy stood, her sharp eyes fixed keenly on Scarside's good-humoured,
  well-featured face; it would have been out of vision for her only Scarside
  never stood when he could sit. Planked on a milking-stool, his hands spread
  on his knees, the Yorkshireman's blue eyes were comfortably on a level with
  the girl's&mdash;pale and light-hued and shrewd.</p>

  <p>Sophy Bassett did not know who it was Miss Irene had seen in the room that
  night: she did not know who it was had carried Devil Ferriby into the
  yard&mdash;but <i>she knew that Miss Irene knew</i>. She knew that someone
  had Miss Irene's wrap, that someone had the amber beads, broken in a
  struggle. Sophy felt that someone must be Mr. Paul&mdash;felt it rather than
  thought it, for her mental faculties entirely, her whole thinking process
  were concentrated on Miss Irene, <i>her</i> position towards the catastrophe
  and how she could be saved first from what had threatened her and now and
  always from self-betrayal. Horror of a crime, detestation of a murderer had
  not touched Sophy, any more than it had emanated from Irene. But common fear
  of detection, exaggeration of results and feminine shifts and secrecies were
  wearing Sophy thin and pale. She stared into Scarside's eyes, as big and
  beautiful and blue as a baby's, and wished she dare tell him things, half
  wished he were some pale, begrimed, London loafer with head thrust forward,
  collarless and slouching, but who would jump to every chance the master's
  death had opened up, and scent where danger lay, and tell her where she'd be
  a fool to do or say a thing, and how Miss Irene must be managed, rounding
  every period with the sharp '<i>See?</i>' that bespoke his own wide
  perceptions.</p>

  <p>Scarside was so big, so clean, so stupid! Suddenly he spoke. 'Do 'ee think
  Muster Paul had any hand in t' master's death?' he said.</p>

  <p>'Oh!'...Sophy clapped her hand to her heart. There is always a shock in
  another person's perspicacity. It was a double one for Sophy&mdash;a bolt
  from the blue. She glanced round, openly scared, and fixed her gaze on the
  huge cellar-flaps, their tarred surface still white with rime. Scarside
  followed her gaze.</p>

  <p>'They flaps were down when I left t' place that night,' he said
  slowly.</p>

  <p>'At the inquest you said you didn't know,' breathed Sophy.</p>

  <p>'And I don't know, if it comes to that,' returned Scarside.</p>

  <p>Sophy was suddenly illumined. Scarside was <i>not</i> stupid. It made her
  dizzy, so that she leant upon him as he still sat unmoved.</p>

  <p>'You're not against Mr. Paul, are you?' she said, with a new timidity.</p>

  <p>'What do <i>you</i> know?' queried Scarside, with an answering
  mastery.</p>

  <p>'Nothing. On my soul I don't. Nothing.'</p>

  <p>'What's all this fashin' wi' Miss Irene?'</p>

  <p>The blood flew into Sophy's face. 'Yer great sawny!' she said, woman again
  the superior. 'D'ye think I shouldn't care if you broke <i>your</i> neck? An'
  we've by a lot not gone so far as they did&mdash;she and Mr. John.'</p>

  <p>Scarside turned this over a moment.</p>

  <p>'Well,' he said, rising, 'so long as there's no one to bother...Mr. Paul
  'll get some black looks,' he added, going back to the pails.</p>

  <p>'Why?' began Sophy. 'Is there others think?...'</p>

  <p>'Mr. Paul's stirring up a lot o' thinkin',' returned Scarside,
  condescending to Sophy with his new show of wisdom. 'He an' Miss Daphne...An'
  I hear this mornin' Mr. Ibimay's dying.'</p>

  <p>'What's that got to do with it?' Sophy thrust forward her eager pointed
  chin. Again Solomon straightened himself and eyed the little figure, ending
  somewhere at five foot one.</p>

  <p>'You bean't so sharp as I thought you,' he said complacently, chuckling.
  'It's common talk in Droitlet as Missus Ibimay was gone on t' master. She wur
  queer at inquest, weren't she?...Mr. Paul's all right...<i>so long as they
  let un be</i>.'</p>

  <p>By now the shining house-pails were scoured and arranged. The swallows
  were darting over the rooftrees of the barns, whistlings and bailings sounded
  cheerily from the yards, and the quick clatter of clogs within as Polly
  flooded and swished in the dairy. Sweethearting was over with the arrival of
  the breakfast hour. 'Gi' us a kiss, lass,' said Solomon, in his usual tones,
  and Sophy held up her cheek with a strange meekness.</p>

  <p>She watched the great figure striding off. It stood to the girl for a
  revelation. Mr. Gisberne come back, Mr. Ibimay dying, Mr. Paul and Miss
  Daphne coupled together, and Mr. Paul looked askance at; and she and Miss
  Irene had huddled themselves together, thinking what they didn't hear didn't
  exist, and all the time here was talk going on.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gisberne, Mrs. Ibimay, Miss Daphne, Mr. Paul. These weeks since Devil
  Ferriby's death Sophy had been seeing things through the medium of sick-room
  absorption, the transfusion of woman's nature aroused to protect and solace,
  and the confusion of a dozen complex, pettifogging personalities and fears.
  To know that Miss Irene knew what man was in the room that night, and to feel
  sure that it was Mr. Paul&mdash;who else save he could have handled the
  master's body?&mdash;had seemed to Sophy the whole of the situation and Miss
  Irene's silence the whole of her aim. But Scarside, coming out as he had, had
  put things into something more of true proportion. Sophy Bassett saw past the
  shadows of Irene Garth's deliriums. That night was no nightmare. She saw it a
  clear fact in the light of day, and men and women moving to and fro about
  it.</p>

  <p>With a spasm that sent the blackness in a wave before her eyes, her
  faculties for one instant spanned the distance between romances and reality,
  between real murder, silent, waiting, doomed, and the sham crimes she had
  read of, wrapped in frenzies and in blood made up to thrill, and giving full
  value for the penny and the expectation...Sophy had thrilled at the sham, and
  sat up half the night with reeling brain, devouring details by a guttering
  light. There was no thrill in her pulses now. The bright air was cold. With
  uncommon quiet she stole back to her household duties. Primeval instincts
  stirred&mdash;caution, lightfootedness, thoughts of hiding and
  escape...Suppose Mr. Paul turned on Miss Irene? He had not spoken to her
  since that night. What about the blue wrap and those broken amber beads? Mr.
  Paul had changed. Suppose he said it was Miss Irene had done it herself?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-4"
     id="ch-2-4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">When Robert Gisberne saw the garden trees of Ferriby once
again through
  the early sunshine he was conscious of a distinct sensation. It was no more a
  pleasant one than the first light twinge in a man's breast of what is to
  prove long-lasting, growing, mortal agony. When had Gisberne ever sustained a
  distinct sensation? Never before, he would have said.</p>

  <p>He was riding leisurely from Petsham on a well-groomed nag hired from the
  Petsham Arms, where he had spent the night. He looked well, trim, and
  fresh.</p>

  <p>Mounting the final rise in the uneven track, he saw the pink and black of
  the Grange roof-lines and the noble stack of chimneys, showing with haughty
  familiarity against the pale glitter of the fair day. Gisberne kept his eyes
  on the great house and its great buildings, and under the slackened rein his
  mount dropped to a walk. At the turning that led past the elm-trees to the
  little gate and the side porch Gisberne stopped altogether. He turned in the
  saddle and looked long and steadily down the silent lane, but after a while
  rode on along the Droitlet road. No living thing was to be seen upon the
  lonely stretches. Larks sang, the plovers called, and a far-off brightness
  marked the sea. The isolated trees round the low, white house of Fulbec came
  now in view. Gisberne quickened his horse's pace, and, putting him on the
  turf to deaden the hoofbeats, struck into a hand-gallop, as if struck himself
  into a sudden heat. At the little mortared bridge over the creek, most like a
  meadow stream just here, he saw a woman. She sat on the low brick parapet, a
  thick white shawl wrapped round her head and shoulders. She was looking
  steadily towards him. Mrs. Ibimay, of course.</p>

  <p>So suddenly did Gisberne draw up at sight of her that his horse, in such
  abrupt check, forced on him a display of neat horsemanship. Devil Ferriby
  himself could scarcely have done better. To dismount was instinct. With the
  same happy sense he knotted the bridle round a hedge-stake and went forward
  rapidly on foot. These trifles were to tell for him at a critical moment.</p>

  <p>'You, Mr. Gisberne?' Dora looked up at him without moving.</p>

  <p>'Yes. You are ill, Mrs. Ibimay.'</p>

  <p>'No&mdash;perhaps...yes, a little. Mr. Ibimay is dead, Mr. Gisberne.'</p>

  <p>Gisberne moved nearer, like a dog, silently expressive. Like a dog's, his
  brown eyes showed kindness and sympathy with her tone.</p>

  <p>'This morning at sunrise,' said Dora. 'I needed space. I could not bear
  the house...What brings you back?'</p>

  <p>'I found things straightened out a bit better than I thought,' said
  Gisberne, speech direct, unapologetic, as he had always made it. 'I didn't
  have to leave England. I'm drawn back to this place. But I wanted to know if
  it would hold me. Did your husband give away that card business, Mrs.
  Ibimay?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'Are you disposed to speak of it, Mrs. Ibimay?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you,' said Gisberne simply.</p>

  <p>A silence followed. It was strange to notice how little a part in the
  ever-brightening day seemed to belong to these two human figures. The
  vanishing hoar-frost, the dancing water, the forget-me-nots and white flowers
  bordering it (a lyric written by a spirit), the wide expanse of moor and
  field over which the breeze was sighing lightly, droning bees and reddening
  touch in the leaves, tree-tops and fleecy clouds and the shining grass,
  distant sheep and Gisberne's impatient horse, even the lines of the white
  house near by, seemed all gathered by the day into a world that was no world
  to them, so plainly did they stand away from it, out of it, uninterested,
  untouched.</p>

  <p>'I am glad you have come back,' said Dora at length. She made an effort to
  rise, so palpable that the man put out his arm. She rested on it. 'I am sick
  and dizzy for want of rest,' she said. 'Where are you going to stay?'</p>

  <p>'At the inn, Droitlet. My record's clean at Droitlet,' said Gisberne, in
  his pleasant tones. His face did not change by a shadow. He was looking at
  her in kindly fashion. He stated a fact.</p>

  <p>'I am glad you have come back,' repeated Dora. 'I have been wanting to see
  you. Will you come over to me in a few days? I will send you word. Why did
  you dismount just now?...It was kind...' Her breath suddenly quickened; the
  set lines of her white face stirred as if the repressed force was threatening
  bounds. 'You <i>are</i> kind, I think,' she gasped, stifling, swooning with
  mounting anguish. '<i>He</i> always rode right up, didn't he, Mr.
  Ferriby&mdash;Devil Ferriby?' She caught a corner of her shawl to her mouth,
  thrust it between her lips, and so stood a breath or so, Gisberne supporting
  her with gentle, dispassionate concern. 'I think he met with foul play,' she
  whispered at length. 'I want to talk to you about it...I...'</p>

  <p>She pressed her hand to her heart, and motioned that he should help her
  back towards the house.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">That evening Gisberne, debating whether he should see
Daphne, thinking he
  would not, found himself on the high road walking on steadily towards the
  Grange. His horse was stabled at the Droitlet Inn behind him&mdash;he had
  paid the hire for a fortnight, and there was gold about his person, enough,
  put together, to close his fingers round. The consumptive Ibimay was dead.
  Gisberne found the reputation he had left here six weeks ago waiting for him
  untouched, like an old coat still hanging where it had been overlooked,
  either to be kept or thrown away, as might befall. It had been left hanging
  to his benefit. There was luck in this, the commonplace, unexciting sort of
  luck Gisberne had had a good deal of. His career had been too mean and petty
  to challenge fate. What he had done, the moment had brought him to do, and
  his doings, till he came to Ferriby, had been purely sordid. And his deeds
  over, he had turned from them as detached as the dog that, at his master's
  whistle, bounds from the side of a dead companion.</p>

  <p>It was Gisberne's nature as little to plan as to regret. His return to
  Droitlet involved a purpose, and to act with a purpose was so strange to him,
  action itself was paralysed. He had not spoken to Daphne Estorel since the
  day of the inquest on Devil Ferriby. That had gone off well, again with the
  commonplace, commonsense sort of luck Gisberne had counted on. Irene Garth
  had not appeared, too ill to attend&mdash;why not, since rumour said she was
  to have married her cousin? Sophy Bassett gave evidence. She had spent the
  night with Miss Irene. The storm was awful. They heard this, and they thought
  that, but they knew nothing till morning broke and the news came in.</p>

  <p>And Daphne Estorel knew nothing. That had been a fine moment when Daphne
  Estorel stood up nobly serene and lied splendidly. Gisberne had the foolish
  fancy the dead man, close by, still unburied, might prove the one to betray
  her, breaking into a 'Bravo!' at something he could so well appreciate.</p>

  <p>Paul Ferriby followed. He lied well, too&mdash;he swore he had not left
  his room that night. Gisberne's own gentle falsehoods seemed of a saintly
  meekness after these; and Dora Ibimay spoke truth, and, with only truth to
  sustain her, showed a pierced heart and troubled brain. Then the storm; the
  countryside still echoed to the ravages and excess of it. It was a background
  against which everything blended into the verdict, 'Death from misadventure.'
  Indeed, that night's doing had blown over so lightly, Gisberne could have
  gone abroad and forgotten them more easily than a loss at cards, save for
  Daphne Estorel. And he had no money. Gisberne was without the knack of being
  adequate; he had done no one thing that lifted him above the need of doing
  other things. He could not look ahead, nor balance risk and gain. If he came
  to hang, it would very well be for the lamb. But Gisberne's soullessness and
  lack of imagination ceased in view of Daphne Estorel. He did not know what
  had happened to him there. With a purpose totally unformed, and yet with a
  purpose most certainly there, bewildering him as a load suddenly thrust on a
  blind man, he was approaching her again.</p>

  <p>In Petsham, Gisberne had been acquainted with the fact of Daphne's
  inheritance. It did not affect him, his interest in money being no more
  particular than his interest in anything else. He had been far more satisfied
  to learn of Ibimay's death, and Mrs. Ibimay's wish to confide in him touched
  him far more nearly with pleasant gratulation.</p>

  <p>He walked on slowly. He could not have told what was in his
  mind&mdash;thinking was a process he made no use of. His air was pleasantly
  grave, his eyes kind and unstrained as ever, the attractiveness of his whole
  appearance heightened by an unconscious ease and strengthened by
  purpose&mdash;vague, unformed, perplexing-still, purpose that had begun to
  show. Debating always whether he should go on or not, Gisberne found he had
  walked to the turning. It struck him that probably he ought to seek the front
  of the Grange&mdash;that this was a private entrance that he, as an unusual
  friend, had been made free of Was he to resume the footing of an unusual
  friend?...These six weeks past Gisberne had been dodging the fact&mdash;the
  fact rather than the fear&mdash;that something might yet transpire to make
  Devil Ferriby's death an awkward matter. He had a score behind him that, if
  brought home, would trip him into jail and a little further&mdash;a
  contingency unlikely, for Gisberne had always played low, only up to the
  point the barren moment of his insignificant life required, and the
  individual items of his acts were worth no one's while to present for
  payment. It would have been folly, however, that even his naivete could
  appreciate, to draw to himself wholesale attention. He had also to live with
  nicety and in cleanly fashion. The money Ferriby might have lent him, and had
  not, he had been frustrated that night in obtaining in another fashion,
  though that fashion had been attempted. He had pawned his last valuable to
  live over the inquiry and get away to town. Therefore had Gisberne's time
  since he left Yorkshire been occupied not with a romance and a secret, but
  with wary shifts for cash and in petty precautions, everything besides
  suspended till a due interval should have safely passed the doings of that
  night into the catalogue of the unquestioned.</p>

  <p>But when six weeks had gone, Robert Gisberne reckoned up, and finding it
  <i>only</i> six weeks, discovered that time between him and Daphne Estorel
  piled too soon into a mountain. He could not give safety any longer in which
  to crystallize; so he ventured precaution against coin, and found himself
  safely the winner of enough money to take him north for a month.</p>

  <p>There was left only the one slight apprehension that Mr. Ibimay's talk
  might need explanation or have spoilt him for Droitlet, his nearest point to
  the Grange.</p>

  <p>But that event with every other was in his favour and an unemotional
  gratitude to luck confirmed his pleasant expression and the kindliness of his
  look.</p>

  <p>Here he was, again, under the wide, wide sky that stretched above the
  Grange. The elms appeared not to have changed a leaf. The elms&mdash;he was
  passing them then. He had turned the lane towards the entrance peculiar to
  unusual friends.</p>

  <p>Yes. As moving slowly yet easily he came in view of wicket and gate into
  the yard, he stopped, bared his head, and drew a deep breath. The petty frets
  and debatings that had been piling up between him and that night were
  instantly behind, and the ground clear between him and Daphne. He looked
  along the path and saw himself and her carrying Ferriby's body. How to Heaven
  had they done it? He retraced their doings and felt her cold lips on his
  cheek.</p>

  <p>If irresolution had been unconscious, resolve was not. Gisberne moved
  forward rapidly, spurred by something that gave him both fear and thrill. He
  felt the leap of life, the quickening of manhood.</p>

  <p>'You, sir!' cried Sophy. She had come running in answer to his knock, a
  scared look on her face.</p>

  <p>'I have startled you,' said Gisberne pleasantly.</p>

  <p>'So few ever come to this door, sir, and&mdash;we thought you'd gone
  abroad.'</p>

  <p>'I'm rather late for a visitor. Ask Miss Estorel if she will see me.'</p>

  <p>'Will you step inside, sir?'</p>

  <p>'No, I'll wait here.'</p>

  <p>Sophy's manner showed an excellent training; the respect of it, the subtle
  taking for granted of the plane to which service is due were not lost on
  Gisberne. It strung him instantly to the answering pitch. He had passed with
  her before as a gentleman&mdash;he would still.</p>

  <p>The entry was already gloomy. The garments hanging from the pegs had been,
  seemingly, weeded out some time since. The ante-room door was shut. Gisberne
  suddenly took a swift step and tried the handle. Locked!</p>

  <p>'Will you come this way, sir?' said Sophy, returning.</p>

  <p>He followed her, the way he had followed Daphne the day of his
  improvisations, but past the 'still-room' into the central hall. The girl
  opened one of the deep-toned, heavy doors. In the space beyond he saw the red
  glow of fire shining on polished wood. As he crossed the threshold his feet
  fell noiselessly into thick carpet. A figure came towards him with
  outstretched hand. It was Miss Daphne, of course, but Gisberne could realize
  nothing further. The room was strange, her dress strange. But we seldom fail
  ourselves. Gisberne found himself speaking with a fine naturalness. 'How d'ye
  do, Miss Estorel?' He bowed.</p>

  <p>'I am very glad to see you.' Their hands touched. 'Sophy, will you put on
  another log?' said Daphne. 'You come in time for dinner, Mr. Gisberne.'</p>

  <p>'It looks so, I admit it, Miss Estorel; but, to speak frankly, I hung
  back, feeling I had scarcely any business to be intruding on you at all. I am
  glad to see you looking so well. You scarcely expected me back north so soon,
  I fancy?'</p>

  <p>Sophy closed the door. They were alone, but not by the flicker of an
  eyelid, the quiver of a finger did Gisberne change his attitude. He knew the
  girl had been kept back that moment to put on the log as a test of him. He
  could not tell whether he had taken the right tone. He judged so, by Sophy.
  His quickness of observation privately amazed him; he had been able to notice
  that she saw everything as most natural.</p>

  <p>'We thought you were abroad,' said Daphne, motioning him to a seat.</p>

  <p>He took it, seeing her with uncertainty, seeing nothing of the room, every
  nerve bent on not disappointing her trial of him.</p>

  <p>It was something to have the instinct to know she was trying him. Gisberne
  felt an immense thankfulness. He had a purpose in being here&mdash;yes, no
  more doubt about that; and here behold him, showing himself equal to it from
  the start.</p>

  <p>He, Robert Gisberne so called, of no education, no origin, insignificant,
  so far overlooked even by detection&mdash;he had managed to be here, fit for
  this woman to touch, to tolerate, associate with, and he was managing, too,
  to understand her, to play up to her idea. Gisberne pulled at his moustache a
  little, showing his nice hand. He was conscious of a glow of health, new
  sensations, of a sound body, an immaculate toilet&mdash;all part of an answer
  to her sudden test.</p>

  <p>Her face was a blurred whiteness, but he was sure he gave no hint of it;
  his knees trembled with the strain to do and say, not the right thing, but
  the <i>only</i> thing, in her eyes. And presently&mdash;oh, unspeakable,
  scarcely bearable, the glow and relief!&mdash;he felt her liking, her
  appreciation going out of her, nearing him, touching him, under the talk of
  trains and roads just as if her hand had stolen forth under a coverlet and
  found and rested upon his.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He could have fallen upon his knees, upon his face. The
first man who felt
  love may have been a king, free to rush forth shouting to a tribe to come and
  set up stones or shake a spear before the sun. Robert Gisberne, living ages
  after, felt love come, and sat quiet, talking pleasantly. And Daphne kept him
  long at the touch. After a while she led him outside and showed him, as to
  some agreeable acquaintance, old bits in the house he had not seen.</p>

  <p>They walked up and down the hall, a door open on a great panelled room,
  where Sophy was setting a table under the painted window.</p>

  <p>'You are sure you will not stay?' she asked again, making a motion towards
  the oasis of light and glitter.</p>

  <p>'Ask me for to-morrow,' he said. 'I shall have, at least, more the
  semblance of being worthy of the honour.'</p>

  <p>He took his leave casually in Sophy's hearing.</p>

  <p>'I will take you back the way you came,' said Daphne. 'It saves you a
  quarter of a mile.'</p>

  <p>'I have scarcely the right, even for that, to be taken twice through your
  kitchen, Miss Estorel,' he answered lightly.</p>

  <p>So vast the kitchen, Daphne and Gisberne crossed the distant corner
  unnoticed by the humming wenches gathered round the fire. In the living-room
  Gisberne let the latch down noiselessly. Daphne saw that he did so, and the
  words died on her lips. They crossed to the other door in silence. Save the
  casements everything was shut&mdash;the bureau, the piano, the door on to the
  stairway; the chairs were in order.</p>

  <p>Gisberne dropped the second latch with the same gentleness. 'Well, Miss
  Daphne,' he said, 'I'll bid you good-evening. It's been a great pleasure to
  see you again.'</p>

  <p>As he spoke he drew back the porch door. Now, how was it to be between
  them? Was the test to go further? Was she meaning to ask of him this always,
  continually? No, for they had talked of everything-her inheritance, Mr.
  Ibimay's death, Irene Garth's seclusion in her chamber&mdash;but not once had
  she spoken of Paul. The reflection strengthened him, and he made an easy
  movement to go, but Daphne caught him back, stepping between him and the
  pathway. Gisberne could see her darkly against the golden dusk.</p>

  <p>'I am glad you have come back,' she said intensely. 'I should have
  written, only&mdash;you gave me no address. You are splendid. To-morrow, be
  sure to come. Goodnight.'</p>

  <p>She pressed his hands that met hers in pure instinct, Gisberne no longer
  knowing what he did.</p>

  <p>He found himself in the lane. She had turned back from the porch at once.
  He found himself staggering, the earth whirling; he fought on to the shelter
  of the elms, stumbled to his knees, and fell forward blind and dizzy into the
  long grass.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-5"
     id="ch-2-5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">Recovering consciousness after a headlong plunge down a
yielding bank, a
  man may find his hand has closed round something tightly, and the first act
  of the senses is to see what he has got.</p>

  <p>It was so with Irene Garth.</p>

  <p>Robert Gisberne's return was her return to full consciousness of Devil
  Ferriby's murder. Alone in her room, she was examining what, in the silent
  terror of her knowledge, she had actually got.</p>

  <p>On the table before her lay a letter from Lawyer Winch. She picked it up
  and read it again, and it led her away from that night and her secret into
  fierce, commonplace reflections. Mr. Winch informed her that, subservient to
  all the legal formalities, a sum of five hundred pounds yearly would be paid
  to her from the Ferriby estates, and that certain rooms in the Grange would
  be set apart as hers, and for her exclusive use, while she still remained
  unmarried. From the contemplation of this offer, satisfaction wrapped in
  hatred and the instant balancing of what it would mean, with instant resolve
  to fling it back into Daphne's face, Irene turned, and returned to the
  examination of her secret. Gisberne's re-arrival on the scene had electrified
  her delirious nightmares into realities. Through them the man she had seen
  blowing out the candle had moved, a shadow, a horror, not flesh and blood.
  Then, as her mind strengthened, it seemed to her vaguely that, in going away,
  Gisberne had gone away for ever, to death perhaps, to places utterly beyond
  her reach. Now her thoughts materialized still more in the shock of Daphne
  Estorel's inheritance, she was considering him anew as one of the
  possibilities left to her.</p>

  <p>Why had <i>he</i> been silent?</p>

  <p>What had he done with the wrap and the beads? She had put out the
  questions forth into space...and, behold I here he was, come back, at hand to
  answer her.</p>

  <p>There was a tap upon the door, and Sophy entered. Irene made a quick
  movement of thrusting something away&mdash;she felt as if doing so. It struck
  her how wonderful it was that, telling Sophy everything else, she had
  <i>not</i> babbled Robert Gisberne's name. Whom did Sophy think she (Irene)
  had seen that night? Who did Sophy think could carry away Cousin John?</p>

  <p>Sophy blenched for a breath at the steady stare of Miss 'Rene's great blue
  eyes, fixed on her as she thought these things.</p>

  <p>'Miss 'Rene dear,' she said. 'Miss Daphne sends her hopes you're better,
  and would you care to join her this evening at dinner.'</p>

  <p>'Is Mr. Gisberne coming?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know, miss. He was asked yesterday. He didn't come, but he's here
  now. Miss 'Rene...He might stay.'</p>

  <p>'She has Jane Skidfell in to dinner, hasn't she?'</p>

  <p>'Mrs. Skidfell won't come, miss. Nor Mr. Paul.' ('And cruel they are to
  refuse,' she could have added.)</p>

  <p>Sophy would not have let Miss Irene know the effect on her of Miss
  Daphne's lonely care of the graces of Ferriby Grange. It was as if, going
  about her work, she lifted her eyes to some rare painting she could not
  understand but felt.</p>

  <p>'Miss Estorel should not ask us to sit down with a servant,' said Irene.
  'I believe she is that woman's daughter, let them say what they please. She
  has no business with Ferriby. Oh, if Mr. Paul would only dispute the
  will!'</p>

  <p>She had said this before, often. Whenever she did, Sophy turned on her, as
  now, swiftly and sharply. 'Don't talk so mad. Miss 'Rene.' And Irene had
  taken it as part of Sophy's general ruling to keep a still tongue. This time
  stronger reflective powers made her glance at Sophy strangely.</p>

  <p>'You'll come down. Miss 'Rene dear, won't you?' the girl said anxiously.
  'You can't stay up here always.'</p>

  <p>'No; I shall come down&mdash;not to dinner. I'll take my meals in the
  living-room, as I used to&mdash;till I go. I'll see Miss Estorel after
  dinner, Sophy.'</p>

  <p>Sophy dropped to her knees beside the beautiful, seated figure. A passion
  sometimes shook her when she gazed on Miss Irene&mdash;a touch of the passion
  of maternal yearning, of celestial pity, only Sophy Bassett dreamed of no
  such name.</p>

  <p>'And you're better, Miss 'Rene dear?' she pleaded. 'You'll be able to meet
  everybody, and go on just the same? It's all over, my dear. You've come out
  safe. And you feel you can trust yourself to let it all be forgotten?'</p>

  <p>Her voice was burdened with memory of Scarside's words: 'Mr. Paul's all
  right, so long as they let un be.' Perchance the name and the fear showed in
  her eyes.</p>

  <p>'Sophy.' Irene looked into them, and bent down to her. 'You know who it
  was I saw in the room that night.'</p>

  <p>Sophy's face sharpened and paled. 'Don't talk of it no more, Miss
  'Rene...' She rose, busying herself a moment in nervous movements, flicking
  away the petals that had fallen from the vase of flowers among Miss Irene's
  brushes and things. 'Why don't you ever send to him, miss?' she said at last,
  over her shoulder, stopping her movements dead.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Paul, you mean?'</p>

  <p>'Miss 'Rene! Who else?...What's he staying on for, Miss 'Rene?...Miss
  'Rene, you ought to see him.'</p>

  <p>'I hate Mr. Paul!' Irene looked Sophy full in the face. 'I wish he had
  been killed instead!'</p>

  <p>'Don't, Miss 'Rene,' whispered Sophy, very white. 'I can't bear to hear
  you. Mr. Paul's been crazy for you a long time, ain't he? Whatever was done
  that night...he done it worked up about you, and...oh, Miss 'Rene, it's too
  dreadful...' Sophy flung her apron to her eyes. She dropped helplessly into a
  seat; the tears rained down. 'If you're going to turn on him, too. Miss
  'Rene&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Irene watched her a moment curiously with a hard look, then she fell to
  comforting and petting. Tendernesses were as easy to Irene as the changing of
  her shoes. Sophy gradually fell back upon sniffs and apologies.</p>

  <p>'I ain't had a good cry,' she said, 'not since that night. Miss 'Rene;
  I've been so worritted about you, an' so scared; and there's Mr.
  Paul&mdash;he don't never show himself, an' you keeping off and saying you
  hate him&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Sophy's figure was pathetic, and she had been very stanch. Irene caught a
  momentary vision of her point of view. Her young lady and Mr. Paul! He a
  picture, she a picture. Why, it was a grand thing to keep your lover's
  secret. And what had he done? Fought another who would have taken advantage
  of Miss 'Rene&mdash;fought him and killed him! Well, there it was&mdash;a
  romance, and love could carry it off head high, if it came to it. Only, if
  there was no love, there was nothing between Sophy and the view of prison
  walls and a nightmare with a gallows in it...Momentarily Irene caught the
  pitifulness of the dilemma.</p>

  <p>'Don't be foolish, Sophy,' she said gently. 'Mr. Paul is more than safe
  with me&mdash;you must know that...'</p>

  <p>Even as the lie to the spirit left Irene's lips the first warning came of
  the price of it. Sophy rose, dabbing her face remorsefully.</p>

  <p>'Now, shall I help you dress. Miss 'Rene?' she said, with a final sniff.
  'I'm that sorry to have been so stupid.'</p>

  <p>'No, thank you, Sophy.' Irene spoke quite quietly, stood quite quietly.
  She showed by no change or flicker that she had been touched as by a flame
  with desire to say aloud: 'It was <i>not</i> Paul Ferriby who killed Cousin
  John. You are quite mistaken. It was not Paul.' The flame touched and
  passed.</p>

  <p>'And you'll speak to...Mr. Paul, Miss 'Rene?'</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;to-night, very likely.'</p>

  <p>'And you'll see Miss Daphne after dinner?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>Sophy turned her face wistfully. At this moment it looked very small and
  peaky and tragically city-bred. Irene stooped her goddess-like fullness and
  kissed the sharp cheek.</p>

  <p>'Oh, Miss 'Rene, I think I'd die to have it never have happened...' Sophy
  choked back the sob. 'You'll make yourself look nice now, won't you. Miss
  'Rene dear?' And she hurried off.</p>

  <p>Irene re-seated herself, smiling, elated. So Sophy did think it was Paul.
  She had expected nothing else, but something uttered weighs more than
  something <i>thought</i>. And what had Sophy said about Gisberne? That he was
  downstairs now. Irene glanced at the timepiece&mdash;five o'clock; and Daphne
  Estorel's new idea of dinner was at half-past six.</p>

  <p>She would not go in to dinner; she would see Daphne afterwards. First she
  would see Paul; she would see both Paul and Daphne before she saw
  Gisberne.</p>

  <p>After the trances and stupors of the past weeks, consecutive thought, the
  merest planning of the merest thing, was a pleasure and a cordial.</p>

  <p>Irene was well again. Gazing into her glass, she saw no change in herself.
  Wanness and hollows had vanished. She dressed herself with pains, though
  pains could end only in one effect&mdash;she was in white. She took long.
  Every now and again the emptiness of the day that would end never more in her
  cousin's bold kiss stabbed her into inaction, and after the stab and the
  inaction she applied again the stimulant of curious questions. Could Sophy be
  right in thinking Paul stayed on at the Grange for her? She had not seen him
  since he put her aside after the reading of the will. Why did he stay? Why
  was Gisberne back? What should she say to Daphne? It grew dark, but long
  before that Irene's room was in a blaze of light; she was very careful to
  avoid the dark. Sophy slept at the foot of her bed.</p>

  <p>Once she was dressed, a spirit of expectancy came over her. Going to the
  door&mdash;the door not on to the stairway but opening on to the landing
  opposite&mdash;she heard Daphne enter her room across it. Irene listened
  carefully and heard when she left. She looked out and caught the soft swish
  of a dress upon the stairs. The house was very still. Let the kitchen-doors
  be open there was then a pleasant hum, for the number of serving maids was
  increased, there were a few more men needing meals, and Jane Skidfell's rule
  at the huge spit and ovens had been made over to a white-mobbed successor,
  who, though not much younger and 'nigh as skilful,' kept not so tight a rein.
  But the kitchen doors were closed and the great house was very still.
  Daphne's door stood ajar. Irene&mdash;suddenly, swiftly-stepped across and
  tapped. But she knew the room was empty. She peered in&mdash;it was a huge
  room. It seemed a journey to the bed in that far recess. On the hearth logs
  were smouldering to red embers. A shaded lamp burnt on a table. The casements
  were open, letting in a frosty air mingling with the sweet fresh warmth that
  was of the room itself. Irene took a step across the threshold and stood
  fascinated. She felt the wide space vibrant still with another woman's life.
  She smote her hands upon her breast, <i>realizing</i> Daphne Estorel.
  Gradually, a red-hot hate tingled through her, and the last shreds of sick
  weakness shrivelled in it. A frenzy of spite shook her and sent her panting
  back against the doorpost for support...Irene steadied herself. Those
  nameless sentinels that guard life and reason warned her&mdash;to steady
  herself. It took a few moments, some deep heavings of her bosom, her hand
  upon her heart. As she turned to go she looked again over her shoulder. A
  thought struck her, and she returned slowly and cautiously to the table.
  There was nothing here at a glance to tempt or to offer reward, but Irene
  looked with inner sight as if someone touched her and pointed where and
  how.</p>

  <p>She bent over a sheet of note-paper; the date upon it and a few
  words:&mdash;'Dear Mr. Winch,&mdash;In answer to your suggestion as to a head
  bailiff or steward, Mr. Paul Ferriby&mdash;' Here the pen had been laid down.
  Beside the letter was a pencilled memorandum of certain purchases and sales
  relating to the farm, signed 'Paul Ferriby.' Close by was a handkerchief in a
  limp, crumpled ball...</p>

  <p>Irene bent her face over the table. Looking up, she caught a sudden vision
  of herself in the swung mirror on the dressing-table, stared at it an
  instant, beginning, even as she stared, to tiptoe towards the door. Over a
  chair-back hung one of Daphne Estorel's garments. Irene caught herself away
  from it, crossing the threshold, drew the door to as she had found it, and
  went to the head of the stairs. They were lighted&mdash;a new thing&mdash;and
  the light threw her white figure and absorbed face into an instant picture
  against shadow and dark wood. Not a sound below. Irene stood, staring down
  absorbed, motionless.</p>

  <p>'If,' she thought, 'Daphne Estorel cares for Paul; if she thinks it was
  Paul who was the death of Devil Ferriby'&mdash;her thoughts seemed to rise on
  an inward scream, though she did not stir&mdash;' then...then...<i>If</i> she
  cares, <i>if</i> she thinks he did it...She does care, she does think so...I
  know it! By her room, I know it.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-6"
     id="ch-2-6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">Curiosity had always had a large share in Irene Garth's
nature. She had
  not found much scope for it, and it had directed itself so far to the
  discovery of facts. Now her curiosity was roused to engage itself with finer
  material. Here were the four of them-Gisberne, Paul, Daphne Estorel, herself,
  and Ferriby dead in the midst of them, murdered, and she held the key. She
  could watch each, she alone, holding this supreme advantage. The new grasp of
  the situation that had terrified Sophy renewed to Irene the old belief in
  herself. If Paul were indeed to be suspected or accused she possessed a power
  that equalized her with Daphne Estorel, and that took the sting out of the
  madness of self-reproach at her past folly.</p>

  <p>An hour or two after she had been in Daphne's room Irene heard from Sophy
  that Mr. Gisberne had left before dinner, having gone away by the front
  entrance, and that Miss Daphne was just about to drive over to Fulbec, late
  though it was, in answer to a message from Mrs. Ibimay; but, since Miss Irene
  had said she would like to see Miss Daphne this evening, would she do so
  first?</p>

  <p>Irene would. She had dined&mdash;not, when it came to it, in the
  living-room, used only that once of the reading of the will&mdash;but in
  the&mdash;'lavender-room' as of old. Luxurious food was no new feature at the
  Grange, but a certain special elegance conveyed in the meal and the change to
  formality from her own room affected her. Always fond of&mdash;' good
  things,' the delicate flavour and odours put her back to the days when she
  was queen. With scarcely an idea what she should say, but, in this humour,
  trusting to the insolence of the blood, Irene went across to Daphne Estorel.
  Daphne waited for her in the room she had begun to use continuously. The two
  had not met since Lawyer Winch's visit. They had not been face to face like
  this since that day in the buttery more than six years ago. Daphne stood in
  hat and wrap. Irene, closing the door behind her, stayed at it. In her hand
  she had Lawyer Winch's letter to herself.</p>

  <p>'Good-evening,' said Daphne, in that strangely bright voice of hers.</p>

  <p>'Good-evening.' Their eyes met in the inevitable summing up.</p>

  <p>'Mrs. Ibimay has sent a message to me,' pursued Daphne, as if trying to
  take things naturally between them, her bright voice helping the effect. 'She
  cannot bear the house, and would like to come over here awhile.'</p>

  <p>'Here?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Before her husband is buried?'</p>

  <p>'No. The funeral is to-morrow. I am going over to stay with her
  to-night.'</p>

  <p>Dora Ibimay had affected friendship neither for Daphne nor Irene. Her
  turning now to Daphne was characteristic. Irene's lip curled. Had the new
  heiress planned she could scarcely have devised a method more delicate or
  equally effective for emphasizing her position. There was a moment's pause,
  antagonism gathering.</p>

  <p>'I have heard from Lawyer Winch,' said Irene.</p>

  <p>'Yes?'</p>

  <p>'I am obliged to you for your offer. I could not, of course, dream of
  accepting it.'</p>

  <p>'Why, of course?' asked Daphne.</p>

  <p>Irene took a step forward. 'Because I do not think it is the right thing
  that you should have Ferriby-you, an outsider. I will not take as charity
  what I have the better claim to. You are profiting by the merest chance. I
  was engaged to Cousin John. By now I should have been his wife.'</p>

  <p>'You should have made your engagement public,' said Daphne, as quietly as
  coldly.</p>

  <p>Irene felt herself deadly white, her passion overmastering. She moved
  again forward. 'I kept my engagement quiet,' she said, 'because '&mdash;she
  paused-'I wanted to avoid&mdash;<i>what had to happen after all</i>!' She
  rushed the words in a gasp, then caught her hand to her side, and stood
  breathing deep, her eyes fixed on Daphne, her lips pressed together fiercely,
  as on some betrayal she had not meant.</p>

  <p>'What do you mean?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing, nothing. If you don't understand me, nothing. I am a Ferriby. I
  only want to tell you I will not take this money; but I am going to stay
  here-for a time, and Paul can pay, out of what you pay him, for what I cost
  you.'</p>

  <p>Envy and all uncharitableness, hate and spite, were plain enough in
  Irene's words, an undisciplined nature behind them. Daphne thought, however,
  she could read in them something more. When she spoke her voice was low with
  great anger, with a superb, slow-growing, righteous wrath of years.</p>

  <p>'Ferriby is <i>mine</i>,' she said. 'Stay in it if you like, but you will
  only stay because I let you. You might have been married to your cousin. You
  kept your engagement to him secret. Yes, why? Not to avoid the two men coming
  together, as you hinted just now, but because of the vile and wretched game
  you have been playing. You brought about your cousin's
  death&mdash;<i>you</i>! Stay here, but be careful in trying to go on with
  your double dealing. You shall behave yourself. You shall be very quiet, very
  careful how you abuse the hospitality of this house, or I shall be just as
  quick to defend it&mdash;and myself. You are false, you are wanton, and
  anyone to whom I say that will believe it. Better never try your word against
  mine.'</p>

  <p>Daphne ended, but the end was not quite with the words. They seemed to
  pervade the room for a long moment after she ceased, then she caught her wrap
  round her and swept on the high tide of her outbreak towards the door.
  Choking, speechless, Irene threw herself between. She motioned with her
  hand.</p>

  <p>'Wait...' she gasped, 'wait...'</p>

  <p>Daphne laughed, her eyes blazing, and threw back her head and stood firm.
  She knew what was coming just as well as she could have guessed the event if
  she had seen a knife in Irene's hand.</p>

  <p>'Shall I tell you why you hate me?' Owing to the madness of her fury
  Irene's voice came in a feeble whisper. 'I expected this...You're in love
  with Paul, and yet you have to know that he killed Cousin John&mdash;for me,
  for <i>me</i>...You are in love with him, and he turned his back on you. He
  killed Cousin John&mdash;for <i>me</i>.'</p>

  <p>She tottered, and Daphne caught her by the arm and flung her to a
  seat.</p>

  <p>'Ah,' she said&mdash;'ah!' And then minutes might have passed or hours.
  Irene, coming somewhat to her senses, gazed up into a face that made her own
  feel wan and nothing. Her fury went out before the blaze in Daphne Estorel's
  eyes like a candle in a fireflame. She cowered as if something were raised to
  kill her.</p>

  <p>'You are mad just now. You don't know what you are saying. But you must
  understand,' Daphne spoke at last in a low voice, 'any mischief or scandal
  will only hurt yourself. Don't make any mistake about me. I am not to be
  insulted, nor to be mocked, nor&mdash;to be <i>beaten</i>. Now, do you want
  to...utter that again? Will you say it to the household?'</p>

  <p>Irene, staring, knew that she fell together. After a moment or two
  Daphne's face and eyes went away, she heard the door close, and knew herself
  still huddled helplessly in her seat. From the grey-wrapped, still, bright,
  silent statue she had called Daphne Estorel there had leaped out living fire,
  and she was smitten. This Daphne Estorel! How she had laughed, this
  <i>woman</i>, Daphne Estorel! Her words bit and seared...After a while Sophy
  Bassett, entering, wearing hat and jacket, found Miss Irene alone in the
  warm, deep-toned brightness of the room still where Daphne had left her, her
  hands locked in her lap.</p>

  <p>'Miss Irene dear, I beg your pardon coming in like this, but...Miss Irene,
  is anything the matter?'</p>

  <p>Irene sprang up lightly. 'No, no, Sophy, nothing. I was only
  thinking...'</p>

  <p>'Miss Daphne has gone, miss.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I know.'</p>

  <p>Sophy gazed a moment dubiously.</p>

  <p>'Were you going out?' asked Irene pleasantly.</p>

  <p>'I did think of it, Miss Irene, for half an hour...Scarside&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Oh, don't waste a moment, Sophy! You have lost too many evenings off for
  me.'</p>

  <p>'You'll be all right. Miss Irene?'</p>

  <p>'Quite,' and Irene smiled.</p>

  <p>Sophy, departing, took a last look at Miss 'Rene as if her manner did not
  wholly please her.</p>

  <p>Irene herself was surprised at the ease with which she had been pleasant,
  and had given Sophy gracious looks. A smile, however, is the first and
  easiest of natural deceptions.</p>

  <p>Sophy had come in upon Irene shaping within her heart no less a thought
  than to fasten Devil Ferriby's death openly upon Paul. She had taken the
  first step towards it in her mad words. It would be easy. In the swell of her
  fury it seemed a little thing to conceive as a revenge.</p>

  <p>Daphne Estorel had towered over her, dwarfed her, blighted her: she had
  fallen before her like a mortal under the threat of a goddess. Irene recalled
  the spread golden hair, the wide shoulders, the eyes like a cut diamond, the
  full nostrils and curving, denouncing, scorning lips. Daphne Estorel from the
  first had stolen in upon her life like something superhuman. It was a small
  matter to plan anything that should drag her down, put her in the mire with
  the rest, agonize, humiliate her, make her crawl and cry! She lost sense of
  Paul. He was only a factor in her scheme against Daphne.</p>

  <p>All unconsciously she was testifying to the difference between them. She
  would strike at Daphne through Paul. She, who had never loved, apprehended,
  seeing Daphne, how love can hurt and slay.</p>

  <p>But Sophy Bassett's entrance broke the spell. Irene reflected. She had yet
  to meet Paul, yet to speak to Gisberne. She could not foresee the turn of
  either interview. Little had she foreseen this sharp encounter with Daphne.
  Curiosity revived. She must wait to know what to do. Only, she had one weapon
  forged.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-7"
     id="ch-2-7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">Paul Ferriby retained his rooms in the coach-house,
suggesting to Lawyer
  Winch the desirability of taking up his residence altogether at a distance.
  He had thrown off manual labour as he had done his slouch and clumsy clothes.
  He would, however, give his position no titles.</p>

  <p>'But you've got the grip of a master on the property, young man,' said the
  lawyer. 'What's your motive?'</p>

  <p>'I may as well earn my living here as anywhere,' said Paul.</p>

  <p>'Humph!' returned Winch. 'I don't know. I don't know.'</p>

  <p>But it was early days to interfere, still soon enough to be thinking of
  change. 'Let sleeping dogs lie,' quoth the lawyer to himself. To outsiders he
  remarked that Mr. Paul was penniless save for what Ferriby paid him, and that
  it was a pity to drive young men like that out of the country. He had a
  genius for management, saved the property twice what it paid him, and time
  enough for changes when Miss Estorel went out of mourning. That Paul was not
  well received in his new capacity Lawyer Winch knew as well as anybody, and
  ignored better. Let sleeping dogs lie&mdash;don't add a breath to float those
  birds of the air that carry a matter. Better a live Ferriby than a dead one.
  Thus the lawyer thought, and if everybody should be of his mind the
  better.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Paul kept his own counsel, and was as little to be seen within
  the Grange as Solomon Scarside. This evening, leaning over the light iron
  railings of the steps up to the door, once the head coachman's own entrance,
  Paul heard the clang of the gate higher up the road, and knew that someone
  was entering or leaving the front garden of the house.</p>

  <p>It was between nine and ten, the air frosty, the night thick with stars.
  He did not move, but, waiting and looking, saw a figure emerge from the
  dark.</p>

  <p>'Paul,' said Irene Garth's voice softly, 'is that you?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'I want to speak to you.'</p>

  <p>'What is it?'</p>

  <p>'Cannot I come up? I cannot say anything here.'</p>

  <p>Silence was Paul Ferriby's only consent. Irene mounted slowly, helping
  herself by the rail. He let her pass him, slowly turned, and followed.</p>

  <p>The room they entered looked no more than just a man's habitation. It was
  large enough, and so seemed barely furnished, though with enough of
  litter.</p>

  <p>A small, old-fashioned bureau stood within the door, in the centre a
  table, armchairs either side the fireplace, guns and fishing-tackle. A brown
  setter lifted her beautiful head from a luxurious basket in a corner and
  spoke with soft, maternal eyes. One picture was on the wall&mdash;a
  steeplechase scene; on the window-sill, in a tumbler, set together without
  arrangement, a cluster of Michaelmas daisies and a crimson rose.</p>

  <p>'Did you put those there?' cried Irene suddenly.</p>

  <p>He glanced round surprised, saw she pointed to the flowers, looked back at
  her silently.</p>

  <p>'What is the matter with you, Paul?' she said, her tone altered. 'I
  suppose I may sit down?...What have I done?'</p>

  <p>He moved restlessly. It was plain that she intruded, that she was outside
  his thoughts, even of anger.</p>

  <p>'What have I done? That day the will was read...I have been very ill...Why
  are you so strange?...' She put her hand out to touch his arm, but it fell
  again to her side. He eyed her.</p>

  <p>'I should have thought you would have understood,' he said.</p>

  <p>'I do not,' she said.</p>

  <p>Her tone of security was unreasonable, considering the nature of the men
  she had been playing with, but her scene with Daphne Estorel had given her an
  insolence as of drink.</p>

  <p>'What am I to understand?' she demanded.</p>

  <p>He looked at her with sudden anger. 'If you didn't understand, why have
  you been so quiet all this time?'</p>

  <p>Ah, Sophy had urged her so often to write, to send a message. Sophy had
  had her own reasons; it would have been better to have fallen in with
  them.</p>

  <p>'I have been ill,' said Irene. 'Cousin John's death like that was enough
  surely.'</p>

  <p>Paul turned away; the anger passed, leaving his face coldly troubled. It
  was very evident speech came to his lips; it was more evident still he could
  not, rather than would not, utter it.</p>

  <p>'You were going to marry him,' he said at length.</p>

  <p>Irene's breathing quickened. 'I always told you he wanted me to marry
  him.'</p>

  <p>'He told me so, too,' answered Paul&mdash;' told me you were going
  to.'</p>

  <p>'Well, he would say that.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, you might have known it.'</p>

  <p>Irene had thought it folly whenever she heard or read that a young man
  could scorn a young woman, a creature young and beautiful like herself. At
  Paul's tone, his pause, his turned shoulder, she started incredulously and
  leant forward and tried to see his face.</p>

  <p>'I don't know what you mean.'</p>

  <p>He was silent. She stood up, scarlet, her head thrown back.</p>

  <p>'When did Cousin John talk to you about me?'</p>

  <p>'That is not the question. He opened my eyes. You know what he
  <i>could</i> tell me. You know what there was between you.'</p>

  <p>'Between us,' she echoed blankly.</p>

  <p>The whole meaning of it was slow in reaching her-did not reach her.</p>

  <p>In the long silence the setter, lifting her head, eyed them over the edge
  of her bed, and still eyeing them, was caught gently back to sleep.</p>

  <p>'When did Cousin John tell you what there was between us?' she repeated at
  length.</p>

  <p>'Not an hour after you were here in this very room asking me to take you
  away because you were afraid of him. It was all planned.' Paul flashed round
  on her. 'He told me so and laughed in my face. Marry <i>me</i>! Go away with
  <i>me</i>! He twitted me with having waited round you too long...He told me I
  was a fool, that I could have you when he'd done with you...that if I had
  chosen...'</p>

  <p>She interrupted with a furious cry. 'And you killed him for saying it!'
  she half screamed&mdash;'you killed him for it!...'</p>

  <p>Paul stood arrested, staring at her as she at him.</p>

  <p>'I see it...' cried Irene. She clutched her breast, and as the wild
  thought gripped her, her knees began to knock together. 'It was that night,'
  she cried...'you met in the storm...You threw him down...Paul, you killed
  him!'</p>

  <p>As she uttered it she believed it. In a flash she saw what <i>could</i>
  have happened. Ferriby had revived; he was not dead when she saw him lying
  there on the floor. He had left the house again, and Paul had met him
  and&mdash;killed him.</p>

  <p>Then, a flash following a flash, she knew again that he had not; she knew
  it was not Paul who had killed Cousin John, for she had seen!</p>

  <p>The desire to say so touched her like flame, and passed. There was a long
  pause. She sank back into her seat and watched Paul awhile. He had not lost
  his composure, though she had plainly startled him. His manner expressed an
  utter coldness and aversion.</p>

  <p>'Of course, I did not mean that,' said Irene feebly. 'I came to speak to
  you&mdash;to ask you what to do&mdash;but&mdash;if you are so
  changed&mdash;if you are believing lies about me&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He still found nothing to answer. He stood aside from the doorway as if
  making room for her to pass. She hesitated between the desire to force him
  further and the wisdom of going. She could easily have passed him&mdash;he
  meant her to&mdash;leaving all else unsaid, but the change in him fascinated
  her. It was greater than the change in Daphne Estorel. Irene perceived that
  she had come from the seclusion and safety of her room into a new place among
  new people.</p>

  <p>'Why should you believe what a man like Cousin John said of a girl quite
  at his mercy?' she asked unsteadily.</p>

  <p>Still Paul made no answer.</p>

  <p>She waited, studying him. The scowl had left his brows, now firm, dark
  lines. His hands were supple, his clean-cut lips under the slight moustache
  reminded her that she had kissed them, and there he stood, a stranger to her,
  the more a stranger for that memory.</p>

  <p>Irene had told Sophy she hated Paul; she had said so to herself
  insistently. No&mdash;she did not hate him.</p>

  <p>Leaning against the door, he began, without otherwise moving, to fill his
  pipe. He was sincerely anxious to end the scene. She saw and felt it. He
  wanted no more of it. She, woman-like, was ready to run the whole
  gamut&mdash;she <i>could</i> not go.</p>

  <p>'I came here to-night to ask you to tell me what to do,' she repeated, her
  eyes fixed on him. 'Daphne Estorel offers me money, so much a year, through
  Lawyer Winch. I have refused it. I saw her a little while ago.' Her breath
  caught at the recall of it. 'Don't you think you might dispute the will,
  Paul? It might be proved that uncle was out of his mind, coerced by Jane
  Skidfell.'</p>

  <p>Acting being nature to Irene Garth, she had slipped in a breath into the
  tone and attitude, gentle and dispassionate, of an unavoidable discussion
  between two who certainly might have quarrelled, but two, nevertheless, whose
  interests were still identical.</p>

  <p>Paul had always known her faults. He must still see her charm, still feel
  it. She would work him back through her helplessness and need of advice to
  forgiveness and reconciliation.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Paul saw her lead, and found it very hard to follow.
  He gave her the look of one encountering the incomprehensible. He seemed to
  struggle with a sheer refusal to answer or have any speech with her. Then he
  drew himself up, and spoke with an effort.</p>

  <p>'I have no money to dispute the will, even if it could be of the slightest
  use.'</p>

  <p>'Some one might take it up for you,' she pursued eagerly.</p>

  <p>'No.' It was a sound of finality.</p>

  <p>'Then '&mdash;Irene's voice dropped a little&mdash;' you are going to
  accept things&mdash;go on staying here?'</p>

  <p>'For the present. I suppose so&mdash;yes.'</p>

  <p>'What did you mean by saying&mdash;that day&mdash;the day of the
  will&mdash;that you were staying on to serve your purpose?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing. It suits me to stay.'</p>

  <p>'And what am I to do?'</p>

  <p>Again he showed the effort with which he treated her, as some one still to
  be so treated.</p>

  <p>'You had better take the money...Your father had friends.'</p>

  <p>'You mean you want me to go away?'</p>

  <p>'I?'</p>

  <p>'Oh'&mdash;she moved nearer and lifted her hand to her throat, as if to
  restrain rising passion&mdash;' you cannot be so indifferent as all this,
  Paul! You cannot mean to treat me so, repudiate me, turn your back on me!
  What have I done, after all? Do you think it was easy to steer between you
  and Cousin John?...You have been poisoned against me by Daphne Estorel.'</p>

  <p>She had taxed him with that before in the old days. Perhaps now it would
  strike response and break him up into some passion or rage in which there
  might be something she could catch at, and so be dragged back to his
  heart.</p>

  <p>Paul's face betrayed neither passion nor rage.</p>

  <p>'Can't you forgive me, Paul?' she whispered. 'Can't we be friends?'</p>

  <p>He moved suddenly, coming back to the table, and the setter leapt up with
  cocked ears and barked. Irene, a little frightened at what she might have
  evoked, dropped into her seat, gazing up at him. Her face was full in the
  lamplight, and, as one blows upon a flame, she made her whole being bear upon
  her own loveliness. She <i>felt</i> how beautiful she was&mdash;she breathed
  it from her. 'Don't be so cruel,' she murmured. She caught back a sob, and
  stretched out her hand to lay it upon his. She was not wholly acting any more
  than in the harness-room that evening. He overcame her with his strong
  presence and his beauty. It was beauty. But she gazed with all her beauty
  turned to it, and saw the fine, dark face still set and unmoved, felt him
  utterly unresponsive. Again she told herself: 'I hate you.' In her own
  despite she went still further. 'I thought you <i>loved</i> me,' she
  whispered. 'You have said so...Oh, you can't have forgotten.' He looked at
  her steadily, going slowly very pale, till the pallor touched his lips.</p>

  <p>'No, and for that very reason,' he said, and paused. The blood had reached
  its ebb. Irene could not take her eyes away, fascinated to see Paul Ferriby's
  dark face so white. 'I begin to see what you are here for,' he said at
  length...I ought to have understood you before...You stand alone, and he was
  very plain with me. Do you want my help&mdash;to get away...or in
  anything?...'</p>

  <p>As slowly as the paleness had overspread his face, so slowly did the full
  meaning of the words reach Irene's comprehension. She stood up, her face as
  bloodless as his.</p>

  <p>'I see...I was stupid just now.' She took a breathless moment and
  controlled herself. 'I didn't understand when you said Cousin John had told
  you...he told you, and you didn't kill him.'</p>

  <p>'No,' he answered, turning from her; 'I didn't care to. You seemed
  scarcely worth it. I <i>believed him</i>.'</p>

  <p>In an instant everything was over. The integral truth or falsehood of such
  a moment makes no difference.</p>

  <p>Irene, crossing to the door, stood there calling on herself to help
  herself. She summoned all her days and deeds in Ferriby to come to her
  rescue. They were all so smirched with falsity she could not shape denial out
  of any of them. It was no use to protest to Paul. She looked round. He was
  standing by the fireplace, his back to her, his head bent. A terrible sense
  of desolation overcame her, greater than when she first felt Cousin John was
  really gone&mdash;dead, buried. She crept back towards the big, motionless
  figure and caught the slack hand, and, holding it between her own, sank down
  in the armchair and lifted a piteous face.</p>

  <p>'Paul, Paul, you don't believe it?'</p>

  <p>He winced, and shrank from her. 'We're cousins,' he said. 'I...of course,
  if you didn't come here for my help&mdash;' He stopped, her hold slackened,
  and he drew his hand away. 'It's rough on you to have lost your chances,' he
  resumed, not looking at her again, making obvious and most painful effort to
  address her naturally and with any interest. 'I should take the money offered
  and leave the Grange. This is a mere nothing to you. You'll speedily forget
  it.'</p>

  <p>'As you will,' said Irene, rising. His tone was like cold water on
  hysteria.</p>

  <p>'I must tell you,' he added, 'Scarside is not yet back from Petsham. He
  will come in here.'</p>

  <p>'I am going,' she said. And yet she hesitated, with a last impulse to
  struggle with him, agitate him, convince, infuriate. She looked at him, and
  saw him still deadly pale. It was sympathy with any show of emotion that made
  Irene Garth so good an actress. She gazed, and was lowered into the dust. She
  knew what his pallor meant&mdash;the effort of offering the common charity of
  men to women. He, a young man, having to offer it to the goddess of his young
  dream...Irene Garth winced, drew together, and stole from the room without
  more ado, without a word.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Scarside came presently riding into the yard, and after a
while knocked at
  the great coach-house doors where Daphne Estorel had battered that night.
  Paul passed through his sleeping-room and the great building, opened a flap,
  and stepped out beside Scarside's swinging lantern.</p>

  <p>'You're late, Scarside.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, sir.' Scarside's explanation was feasible, without including the
  fact of Sophy Bassett's having come to meet him, thinking he drove instead of
  rode. This entailed humorous incidents entirely for his own edification.
  Sophy had been sent on in a passing tradesman's cart. Scarside was laughing
  inwardly to think of it.</p>

  <p>Since Devil Ferriby's death Scarside and a boy slept on the premises over
  the stables. Paul walked thither with the man. One of the dogs ran up eagerly
  and nosed his hand.</p>

  <p>'That brute 'll dee,' said Solomon gruffly. 'He's skin and bone, for ever
  nosing round the cellar-flap. It was his howlin' woke me that morning o' t'
  accident. 'I'd hae he shot, Mr. Paul.'</p>

  <p>'Shot! Because he misses his master?'</p>

  <p>Solomon grunted that if he did that it 'ud be a mercy to end it.</p>

  <p>'You watch un,' he said. 'He'll take to howlin' regular. <i>That</i> won't
  do.'</p>

  <p>Silence was the tradition of the Grange watch-dogs. 'If he's not right
  he'd better be taken off duty!' said Paul shortly.</p>

  <p>His business with Scarside accomplished, the two exchanged a brief
  good-night, and, carrying the big keys delivered to him, Paul turned back to
  his quarters. Reaching the coach-house, he whistled guardedly. He did not
  wish Scarside by chance to hear. The dog came out of the dark slowly to his
  knees. Paul stroked and patted his head. 'You poor old chap!' he said very
  gently. He bent to the dog's level and looked into his eyes. 'You saw
  something that night,' he said, speaking into them.</p>

  <p>At his tone the creature threw back his head, and his bristles
  rose.&mdash;' Ah!' Paul rose, still keeping the dog at his knee. He went back
  to Irene Garth's words: '<i>You</i> killed Cousin John!' Killed! Devil
  Ferriby killed&mdash;in the sense of murdered! Was that a general idea, Paul
  asked himself, or only the flare of Irene's wrath and shame?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-8"
     id="ch-2-8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">It was late for Scarside to be returning from Petsham, but
still only a
  little past ten, when Irene returned to the house after her visit to Paul.
  One of the new maids was tending the fire in the room she had left&mdash;an
  elderly, superior person.</p>

  <p>'Will you touch the bell, miss,' she said, 'when you're ready to go
  upstairs? Is there anything I can get you?'</p>

  <p>'I don't want to keep you up.'</p>

  <p>'Oh no, miss.'</p>

  <p>'I should like some coffee.'</p>

  <p>The woman departed. Irene dragged herself to a chair by the
  fire&mdash;dragged herself purposely, indulged herself in a tottering
  attitude, and fell into the seat, pushing back her hair, her lace gown
  trailing, twisted round her. She could imagine herself before an audience
  doing this upon a stage, after such a scene as she had had with Paul. She
  imagined Paul playing with her&mdash;how well he had played!&mdash;and then
  the parts thrown aside, and she, behind the scenes, his queen and he still
  adoring. Only this was <i>her</i> life, and in life, when acting behind the
  scenes, a woman is alone. The coffee was brought, elegantly. On the tray were
  pieces of beautiful old silver long kept hidden. Irene saw around her, in
  everything. Daphne Estorel's touch. She could divine plainly, from the
  platform of a lesser intelligence and poorer imagination, how the new owner
  would restore grace and beauty to the Grange, and how in her her uncle, Devil
  Ferriby, had thought for the redemption of a degenerate race, a race that had
  traitors in it like Cousin John!</p>

  <p>For a while she lay back, inert in a painless reverie. In the warm
  comfort, under the fine stimulant, reflection gradually took on more vivid
  hues: her blood, stunned, began again to circulate. Ferriby was Daphne
  Estorel's...Cousin John was dead. Paul had done with her. Irene's knowledge
  of men and of herself, given by her own nature and set free in intercourse
  with Devil Ferriby, told her that passion has no judgment, and that love can
  forgive. She had plumed herself Paul loved her. He had not loved her. No man,
  she thought, ever would. The hate of Paul she had boasted of to herself had
  proved only a passionate interest. That had been put out like flame by water:
  she felt no hate now, only dull dislike of his escape from her. He had told
  her to take the money offered, and go away, and the saintly Daphne had turned
  upon her. It was all over, over for ever, thought Irene, for youth is nothing
  to the young. Life must be now, this instant, or it is nowhere, it is
  nothing.</p>

  <p>Ferriby, with its triumphs, and amusements, and lovers, had gone with
  Devil Ferriby into his grave-gone out of reach. What was she to
  do...penniless, forlorn, alone? She possessed her secret...she had her
  beauty: there was Robert Gisberne.</p>

  <p>To her secret Irene had added by twisting double a plain thread, firstly
  by her mad false words to Daphne, secondly by her mad and false suggestion to
  Paul.</p>

  <p>It remained to see Gisberne. Irene had planned a meeting with him this
  evening, and, though it had grown late, her mind offered no objections to its
  still taking place.</p>

  <p>At eleven she rang the bell, took her bedroom candlestick, and went up the
  wide stairway. She dragged herself still, as weary as if she had walked
  miles. She did not know agitation of mind could equally fatigue. In her room
  everything was ready, no one there. Sophy undressed in her own chamber, and
  came to Miss 'Rene the last thing, arranging her night-lights, and smoothing
  the coverlet with gentle touch.</p>

  <p>Irene stood and looked round the wide and comfortable space. Emotion was
  spent. She felt she would be sorry to leave Ferriby. She regretted many
  things. She would have been glad, she thought, to die.</p>

  <p>Then she heard the sound of horse's hoofs. The air, still and frosty,
  carried it clearly. Devil Ferriby! He used to come at that light canter down
  the lane!</p>

  <p>Devil Ferriby was in his grave...A little cry parted Irene's lips, and she
  who a moment since had thought nothing could move her more ran to the window
  with wild eyes and unuttered, awful expectation...</p>

  <p>No, no! Cousin John was dead.</p>

  <p>The hoof-beats stopped, and presently Irene, straining her eyes, saw the
  figures of man and mount emerge into view, clear in the starlight, walking
  along the grassy border of the lane.</p>

  <p>The man was Gisberne. As he stopped at the gate and began to secure the
  bridle, Irene, hearing a sound behind her, looked round and saw Sophy. She
  was still dressed.</p>

  <p>'Miss 'Rene, I was so late, I thought&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Mr. Gisberne has just ridden up,' broke in Irene, her tone
  excited.&mdash;' Go down and let him in.'</p>

  <p>Sophy fell into an attitude of terror. The tradesman who had given her a
  lift spoke of rumours spreading, ugly talk. This late visit, anything out of
  the ordinary, was alarming.</p>

  <p>'Miss 'Rene,' she gasped, advancing breathlessly, 'it's something about
  Mr. Paul...'</p>

  <p>'Is that you, Miss Garth?' came Gisberne's pleasant voice. 'I am very
  late, but riding back from Petsham, I thought I would venture to enquire if
  Miss Estorel is at home. She tells me she does not go to bed very early.'</p>

  <p>Irene leaned from the window. She liked to know this man there, to hear
  his voice. Her secret knowledge of him tingled in her blood revivingly.
  Through her scene with Daphne, in her interview with Paul, <i>this</i> had
  been what she clung to, or she must have sprung upon them both, she thought,
  and tried to tear them to pieces. She had this man, at least, who should
  never dare to flout her.</p>

  <p>'Miss Estorel is spending the night with Mrs. Ibimay at Fulbec,' she
  said.</p>

  <p>'Ah, I will see her there, then, in the morning.'</p>

  <p>'Is it something of importance?' she asked.</p>

  <p>He paused a moment. 'No, not exactly. Only a question of her decision in
  time. She asked me to arrange a purchase for her.'</p>

  <p>'It's something about Mr. Paul,' whispered Sophy, again from within the
  room.</p>

  <p>'I'm sorry to have disturbed you,' said Gisberne below. 'I'm off now.
  Good-night, Miss Garth.'</p>

  <p>Irene leaned further from the window, speaking very steadily: 'Mr.
  Gisberne, <i>I</i> should like to see <i>you</i> about something. Will you
  come on here to-morrow after you've called at Fulbec?'</p>

  <p>'With pleasure. Of course. I am absolutely at your service. Good-night.
  What time? Noon, shall we say? Good-night.'</p>

  <p>She moved her hand towards him, drew back, and dropped the curtain.</p>

  <p>Gisberne remounting, felt a curious liking for the creature that seemed
  pleased to feel him on his back and know no difference in him to any other
  man.</p>

  <p>He rode with relief out of the dark of the elms and the hedgerows into the
  open starlight. The half-seen road wound before him to Daphne Estorel&mdash;a
  long and hidden way. Behind him only the dark lane separated him from Irene
  Garth.</p>

  <p>'She saw me that night,' he said to himself.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A little before noon the next day Gisberne walked up the
lane. He knew he
  had been too ready to consent to an interview, chosen at a time and season
  when Daphne Estorel was away; on the other hand, there is little gained by
  fencing with a certainty.</p>

  <p>Irene Garth had seen him that night...The great majority of us dress and
  sleep and eat and drink day after day, year after year. To discuss and read
  of, possibly imagine, the great emotions is a relaxation that pronounces us
  gifted; to experience them&mdash;how rare! A little careless enjoyment of the
  sun, idle longings, a heartache or two, a little love-making, a little
  marvelling at the way we are made, a few anxieties, philosophy at last
  instead of passion and slow tranquillity to end it, all 'rounded with a
  sleep'&mdash;this is the way with most. Rocks and trees and sky and land look
  the same to the crowd from one year to another.</p>

  <p>But Robert Gisberne was touching limitations. He might be soulless, but he
  had been gripped by a human feeling that could carry him to either side, or
  above, or below, far as humanity can carry an experience. He knew it, and
  trembled at what he found in himself.</p>

  <p>Also, he was coming to the end of his money&mdash;as ever. What man shall
  say what is salvation who has not been well attired and needing money? Nerve,
  however, was still his&mdash;a resource scarcely drawn upon. He had to give
  as yet no heed to his composure, nor fear any trembling of the hands or
  change in his smooth face.</p>

  <p>But those pleasant brown eyes saw nothing as they used to.</p>

  <p>They were bent now on the ground as Gisberne walked forward lightly, if
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>He was asking himself questions on which his life depended. He could look
  up, however, and without a quiver see Irene coming as slowly towards him as
  he moved towards her.</p>

  <p>Gisberne was neither astounded nor panic-struck to realize that Irene
  Garth was witness of his deed that night. At the time he imagined his usual
  luck had saved him, but that she had seen him was well within even
  probability. He had chanced her coming on the scene at any moment when he and
  Daphne were occupying themselves with the body.</p>

  <p>He <i>knew</i> she had not seen Daphne, and that fact afforded room to
  turn round in. The brown eyes surveyed Irene very pleasantly and quietly as
  she approached.</p>

  <p>The sun was hot, and she, in the invariable white, carried a parasol over
  her bare head. She showed tall and fair, and walked with a grace of animal
  pride in her upright figure and slim lines. Her loveliness was unmarred.
  There were no signs of tears or wakeful ness. Gisberne had heard of her
  illness&mdash;that she had shut herself in her room, and been like to die. He
  did not think it was of grief! She had recovered, he saw.</p>

  <p>They met gravely, and she did not offer her hand, for which he was glad,
  just as he was glad his horse could know no difference. He took the white
  hand of Daphne Estorel. Irene Garth's soft fingers laid in his would have
  revolted, and not reassured him.</p>

  <p>'Good-morning, Mr. Gisberne.'</p>

  <p>'I am punctual. Miss Garth.'</p>

  <p>'Yes...Have you seen Miss Estorel?'</p>

  <p>'No; on second thoughts I decided not to disturb her. What did you want to
  say to me?' He spoke with calculated straightforwardness. It was a mere
  useless strain to beat about the bush, and Irene had, in fact, meant to meet
  him simply with three words&mdash;' I saw you.' Yet she faltered before his
  composure. There is tremendous power in the actual person. Gisberne struck
  her as improved, good-looking, easy, well-dressed. She felt at once as she
  had felt with him before&mdash;much older, free from all need of pretences,
  not afraid to discuss things; and so she faltered, for she needed a friend,
  and while her secret was unuttered Gisberne seemed still possible as one.
  Afterwards&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He stood waiting and quietly watching.</p>

  <p>'I am glad you have come back,' said Irene at last, in a low tone, looking
  away.</p>

  <p>He started, and gave an involuntary glance towards the farm. Who was the
  prompter of this? Glad he had come back! So Dora Ibimay had said, so Daphne
  Estorel, so now Irene Garth.</p>

  <p>'What is it?' he asked. 'Why do you say that?'</p>

  <p>She hesitated still vaguely over an idea that she need not, after all,
  denounce Gisberne, even to himself, unless she chose. His deed was her
  secret&mdash;she did not call it, or feel it, crime&mdash;and she herself had
  been too closely connected with Devil Ferriby's death to look upon its nature
  dispassionately or disconnectedly. Since last night, moreover, she could
  think of Cousin John fiercely and with bitterness&mdash;a brute, a coward, a
  betrayor, and traitor. Should she pretend to Gisberne she had seen nothing?
  Should she wander on with him along the summer road and try to forget, and
  ask his help, as she had meant before any of it happened? No; if she did not
  tell him to-day she should to-morrow. She must see what he looked
  like&mdash;she must hear what he would say. 'Shall we go back to the house?'
  she said.</p>

  <p>'I don't mind in the least,' was his pleasant answer, but he winced
  inwardly. He'd seen something of Irene Garth's dramatic instincts! He winced,
  and braced himself.</p>

  <p>Was that servant-girl Sophy Bassett also a witness of what happened that
  night?</p>

  <p>Gisberne moved very quietly...He felt no particular rage towards Irene. It
  was the way things had 'panned out.' Sick desperation touched him an instant
  with thought of complications ahead, but he had lived always by the moment,
  for the moment, and doing simply what the moment brought. The old habit
  ruled. Like a Circe, he at her heel, Irene led the way back to the house,
  through the porch, back into the living-room, as he knew she would.</p>

  <p>The air of disuse was over the place, modified by a bright fire, reflected
  cheerily from bureau, table, and panelled walls.</p>

  <p>Irene crossed to the door on to the kitchen quarters, and, opening it,
  listened.</p>

  <p>'The servants are all at dinner,' she remarked.</p>

  <p>Gisberne waited curiously to see how she would drop the latch. She snapped
  it into place, and he drew his breath, as if relieved.</p>

  <p>'I had my breakfast here,' said Irene. 'I must begin to use this room
  again while I remain. It is the only one at my disposal. Will you sit
  down?'</p>

  <p>'No, I don't think so,' said Gisberne.</p>

  <p>She moved to the fire. The sun was hot without. The room, sunless till
  evening, and disused, was chill. She stood looking into the flames in
  silence.</p>

  <p>And she remained silent&mdash;a long while.</p>

  <p>It was as effective as words, and more unnerving. Gisberne gave a thought
  to his revolver, but knew it was the merest nervousness. That was a far-off
  end, and, before the end came, he had everything to win. He had been making
  shift at a paltry game for pettifogging gains. It was different now. His
  actions should not creep any more along the edge of things. They should march
  alongside destiny, for did he not love Daphne Estorel?</p>

  <p>'<i>Say anything you like to me at any time</i>,' Gisberne had said in
  this room, and to Irene. But such a silence as lasted now between them went
  further than any speech&mdash;a silence only possible to strange sympathy and
  affinity, yet neither quite sympathy nor quite affinity: the something
  between that keeps creatures quiet when side by side upon the trail and on
  the one hunt, elemental, instinctive.</p>

  <p>'What am I to do?' said Irene at length. There swelled in her throat the
  pang of bereavement; utterly unexpectedly, she was in tears. She missed
  Cousin John. It seemed to her this man should restore him. 'What am I to do?'
  she said. 'What am I to do?'</p>

  <p>And then Gisberne knew that he was pretty safe. With him, till now,
  everything was personal; he knew neither abstractions nor ethics; the essence
  of a thing was nothing; actions he named by their results; for motive he had
  the moment's need, and for principle a suave trust in luck and personal
  ambitions that were fair and decent.</p>

  <p>Irene Garth had no abstractions either. She also knew no ethics. They met
  on level ground with neither to cry, 'Conscience, conscience!' To this for
  sole education and habitude of mind add now on Gisberne's side an idea all at
  once as big as humanity: all the poetry and passion and all the dreams of all
  time to be expressed in the effect upon him of the person and nature of
  Daphne Estorel. There was no measurement even possible beside such a scale;
  nothing worth discussing as right or wrong any more than it is worth while
  whispering the principle of life into a dead man's ear.</p>

  <p>Should Irene Garth once become so inspired and so obsessed, she and
  Gisberne would be fairly equally balanced.</p>

  <p>They were so far now in unison. To begin with, Irene could not confuse
  Gisberne. Outside the new standard Daphne Estorel inspired he had none at
  all; outside that new absorption, natural promptings only. Irene was
  crying&mdash;he had seen girls with creamy skins, full-bosomed, petulant in
  charm, howling in log-cabins, screaming over fallen men; he had seen them
  comforted. He had heard them lie and bear false witness in Courts of Justice
  and before God and man, and then known them tear themselves to tatters over a
  wretched little bit of hidden truth; they were no ideals, these, scarcely
  fellow-creatures, man's summer mate, a breed that he domesticates, and tames,
  and pets to a level with the caressing hand. And Irene Garth was of this
  kind.</p>

  <p>'What did you think of doing?' he asked, making no more pause. He had
  endured the silence to get a grip on his own nerves and weaken her. He knew
  what he was going to say. Irene struggled with her tears. Gisberne came
  gently nearer. Her weeping became violent.</p>

  <p>'Don't!' he said. 'Come, come to the window. The air will revive you. The
  heat of the fire will cause headache. Come.'</p>

  <p>He led her to the dais, and it did not strike her his arm was round her.
  He placed her in a chair. 'Shall I get you some water? Shall I call someone?'
  He bent towards her with a soothing gesture. She motioned and he waited,
  setting another casement open, pushing a stool out of the way. She heard him
  move down to the fireplace and replace a log.</p>

  <p>These little natural touches in between tragic and momentous issues were
  peculiar and of strange effect. Daphne Estorel had found them so.</p>

  <p>At last Irene's hands dropped from her face; she sank back wearily,
  closing her eyes, her bosom heaving.</p>

  <p>'I can't believe it,' she whispered. 'I can't believe it.'</p>

  <p>'No?...Why think of it, Miss Garth? Must you?'</p>

  <p>She opened her eyes. Gisberne, seated on the music-stool opposite her low
  seat, met her look unmoved.</p>

  <p>'I can't believe it,' she whispered. 'What am I to do? Mr.
  Gisberne'&mdash;her face changed and paled till every vestige of the flow of
  tears had gone&mdash;'that night...I <i>saw you</i>'</p>

  <p>'H'sh!' said Gisberne gravely. 'Hush! Be very careful...Why! I know you
  did.'</p>

  <p>'You knew?'</p>

  <p>'Why, Miss Garth, is this what you wanted to tell me? I should say you
  might have guessed I knew.'</p>

  <p>She sat forward, tense in every muscle.</p>

  <p>'I saw you,' she repeated.</p>

  <p>He gave a whimsical twist to his eyebrows. 'I'm sorry,' he said, half
  smiling. Then, even as her lips parted ready to scream at him, the brown eyes
  narrowed, something in the quiet face warned her. Fear, most instantaneous of
  all instincts, swifter than thought, touched her, and she caught herself
  back.</p>

  <p>'You had to see me,' said Gisberne. 'Why, of course. It was you taking the
  risk or I...I took it for you. Let me mention. Miss Garth, that I saw
  <i>you</i>. I've got your wrap and the broken string of beads.'</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet, white-faced, wide-eyed&mdash;and the stare of blue
  eyes is deathly. 'But I <i>saw you</i>,' she whispered. She pointed to the
  floor by the bureau. 'He lay there with a white cloth on his face&mdash;a wet
  cloth...white...there. I saw you move away and set down a bowl of water. You
  turned. I saw you as you blew out the candle.'</p>

  <p>Gisberne felt the room whirl suddenly and grow dark. In the dark he heard
  Irene begin again mechanically: 'He lay there with a white cloth on his...'
  He put out his hand...</p>

  <p>The moment's faintness passed. Irene's face came back, and he found he was
  holding her gently by the shoulder.</p>

  <p>'Then you think <i>I</i> murdered your cousin?' he said.</p>

  <p>She drew nearer. 'I saw you.'</p>

  <p>'Your cousin was dead already, my child, before I touched him. <i>You</i>
  killed him, tumbling him down.'</p>

  <p>'No; I heard you scuffling.'</p>

  <p>'Did Sophy Bassett hear?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'See?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'Well...what are you going to do?'</p>

  <p>She was close to him, almost in his hold. She began disjointed words:</p>

  <p>'He was a brute...He lied about me; he betrayed me...I...I...miss him...I
  am dreadfully lonely. How could you?...I ought to speak.'</p>

  <p>'Speak? Why, yes, speak if it'll help things,' said Gisberne.</p>

  <p>'You'd say <i>I</i> did it.'</p>

  <p>'They wouldn't hurt you for taking care of yourself,' he answered. 'I had
  no motive but to stand by you. You've been left to yourself these weeks,
  haven't you?...Good for you. Better than if you'd had to stand up, defending
  yourself, answering questions...I've seen your cousin's sort before, and your
  sort, too...We know what happened. I told you this place was too small to
  hold you...I told you to get out of it...I wish you'd let me know of this
  when it first came into your mind...<i>I</i> had no motive. There are others,
  though, who might have had a motive in killing Devil Ferriby for meddling
  with you.'</p>

  <p>For the first time Irene looked at another human being with the uttermost
  desire to see. For the first time she listened with the utmost power of
  hearing.</p>

  <p>Gisberne's tones were gentle to persuasiveness. He was pale, his attitude
  concerned. He conveyed by who knew what in his nearness that encroached no
  iota, the kindliness of his look, his touch, as encouraging as firm, that his
  concern was for <i>her</i>. She believed it against herself.</p>

  <p>'I expect I'd better have left it all alone,' he said; 'but it seemed to
  me you none of you wanted Mr. Paul in trouble; and if I've got your wrap and
  beads, Miss Garth, why, so much the better for you. If Mr. Paul had found
  them you would have been dragged in, and there's no sense in that for a girl
  with your chances.'</p>

  <p>Irene's throat went dry. She did not try to cry out, she made no motion of
  horror or rejection, nor did she recoil by so much as a quiver. The sensation
  caught her of cold and loneliness, as if water closed her in, and then she
  felt she could not drown or die <i>alone</i>. She must keep close to
  Gisberne. They were going to the same place. She began speaking
  incoherently...</p>

  <p>'Put your arms round me...hold me...save me.' Her head fell forward on his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>In a dream, not fainting, she felt his arm about her, steadying her, and
  then the rim of a pocket drinking-cup against her lips.</p>

  <p>'Take a little...you're faint.'</p>

  <p>She put it from her, and stood upright. Her throat was moist and she spoke
  instantly.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Paul...Is that what you would say, if&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'If you feel called upon to make a fuss it would have to be that. Miss
  Garth, unless you care to own to it that it was yourself.' He slipped the
  flask back, his movements so dexterous that even at that moment she watched
  them, and looked at her steadily. Her eyes came back to his. A cat rose
  suddenly into view on the wide window-sill, and stretched itself grotesquely.
  It seemed suddenly that they had got very far from anywhere, that it was very
  late on some strange long day, in a remote, unfamiliar place.</p>

  <p>'Are you better?' said Gisberne kindly.</p>

  <p>'Yes, quite.' She moved towards the door. 'I cannot bear any more now,'
  she said faintly. 'I shall see you to-morrow?'</p>

  <p>'It is more than likely, Miss Garth.'</p>

  <p>'Why did you come back&mdash;to Ferriby, I mean?'</p>

  <p>'Wasn't it natural I should? I wasn't easy. I had the notion to see for
  myself that things had settled down without any trouble.'</p>

  <p>'You will find <i>I</i> shall give you no trouble,' said Irene.
  'Good-bye.'</p>

  <p>She offered her hand. Gisberne had no feeling in taking it. His only
  concern now with Irene Garth was to get the right clue as to the motive of an
  accomplice; he thought already that he had it.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-9"
     id="ch-2-9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">Scarside, driving his mistress home that evening from
Fulbec, pointed out
  with the handle of his whip that 'Muster' Gisberne was there, ahead of them,
  along the road.</p>

  <p>Daphne was alone with her driver. At the last moment Mrs. Ibimay had
  changed her mind. She could not come to the Grange; it also was a house of
  mourning, she said. She would go away for a while to other friends at a
  little distance.</p>

  <p>Gisberne walked to and fro at a bend of the road, obviously waiting for
  the pony-car to come within approach. Scarside eyed him sourly. It wasn't
  much to his liking to raise his forefinger to 'Muster&mdash;' Gisberne. Not
  so much that he didn't like him&mdash;no one at the Grange had cause of
  complaint with Gisberne-only there was a feeling he was after Miss Daphne.
  Miss Daphne had called Mistress Skidfell 'aunt' for years, and Mr. Paul, a
  Ferriby to the bone, had worked alongside Tom, Dick, and Harry in the
  fields&mdash;never mind for that. There were some few left with still enough
  instinctive sense of an old name to begrudge its abode to a Mr. Nothing from
  Nowhere, however plumed.</p>

  <p>'He's a bold un,' thought Scarside behind his glower, 'to follow her up
  open like this be.'</p>

  <p>And Gisberne took the matter boldly and very easily. It pleased Daphne to
  see how easily. Each time they met and spoke her confidence in him was to be
  increased, it seemed.</p>

  <p>He came up to her side, calm, equable, pleasant. Her woman's eye decided
  there was about him the very right touch. Her soul, sad within her at the
  dreary day she had passed, the funeral train she had seen, brightened as at a
  sound of music.</p>

  <p>Scarside, his whip erect, stared like a carven man over the pony's ears as
  she leaned forward and put out an eager hand.</p>

  <p>'You must forgive my "holding you up" like this. Miss Estorel,' said
  Gisberne. 'I ought to have seen you this morning, but, as you'll understand,
  I couldn't intrude on you at such a time. Finding you would be driving home
  just now, I thought I'd venture waylaying you.' Their eyes met, in a code
  already established.</p>

  <p>'About that picture?' said Daphne at once, paling.</p>

  <p>'Exactly. It's worth looking into, but we've lost a day&mdash;I
  thought&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'It's very good of you to trouble,' she said. 'I am deeply interested and
  obliged. I will get out and walk. Explain, Solomon, that I shall be home
  immediately.'</p>

  <p>Gisberne helped her to alight. Scarside drove on smartly, and the two
  figures were left upon the lonely road. It was near the spot where Dora
  Ibimay and Devil Ferriby had parted&mdash;without a kiss&mdash;the day of his
  death. This evening the bare landscape gathered glamour in a rosy mist. The
  sun was setting for a frosty, starlit night.</p>

  <p>'You are alone. Miss Estorel,' said Gisberne.</p>

  <p>'Yes; Mrs. Ibimay went away with some friends. You've been to the
  Grange?'</p>

  <p>'I went last night; I saw Miss Garth. I was there again this morning.'</p>

  <p>'Miss Garth&mdash;' Daphne began. She closed her lips again.</p>

  <p>'There's something wrong with Miss Garth'&mdash;Gisberne took her up
  quietly&mdash;'a little hysteria perhaps&mdash;over-excitement. You don't
  think?'...he stopped, and she turned a startled glance.</p>

  <p>'What? You mean she may know something?'</p>

  <p>'It strikes me that way, Miss Estorel, I am bound to admit.'</p>

  <p>Daphne walked on silently, putting from her strongly this most hideous
  suggestion...If Irene shared her knowledge, if Irene also were screening
  Paul, and with Paul's connivance!...She reflected.</p>

  <p>'It is impossible,' she said.</p>

  <p>'I'm glad to hear you think so. Miss Estorel.'</p>

  <p>She searched his face. 'Was this what you wanted to tell me?'</p>

  <p>'No...I heard yesterday in Petsham that there's a hint starting of foul
  play. I thought I'd warn you. You might catch a word from a servant and be
  startled.'</p>

  <p>'It's hinted against&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Mr. Paul...yes.'</p>

  <p>The sun dropped, the rosiness vanished, and the low white mists rose
  quickly. They walked on, looking ahead, silent, preoccupied. Near by was the
  stone wall that had stood out in ghastly fashion under the storm. They had
  passed the shepherd's cottage; Scarside was long out of sight. It was not a
  cheering spot in which to say 'good-bye,' nor a bracing one in which to hear
  bad news.</p>

  <p>Daphne looked round, then her glance came back to Gisberne. In the wide
  loneliness he stood for everything. Suddenly their quiet culminated. She
  stopped abruptly and pale, and terrified she put out her hands to him. 'I
  have made it worse by meddling,' she said hoarsely, 'and I have involved you!
  It is so awful! I think, without you to speak to, it would craze me.'</p>

  <p>He pressed her hands a moment, put them from him. 'We'd better walk on,'
  he said; 'best not chance any show of a conspiracy. Don't get frightened.
  Miss Estorel. You may believe I wouldn't have told you, only it saves it
  being sprung on you...Did Mrs. Ibimay say anything about coming back?'</p>

  <p>'Yes; she wants to keep on Fulbec' Her gasping tone and dilated eyes
  questioned him desperately.</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid she's at the bottom of it,' said Gisberne. 'Miss Estorel, did
  it ever strike you that she and Mr. Ferriby...' He paused expressively.</p>

  <p>She was startled evidently, silent, her eyes demanding, insisting: 'Go on,
  go on.'</p>

  <p>'I don't know,'...she said after a moment. 'Yes, perhaps...no, I don't
  know.'</p>

  <p>'Well, there <i>was</i> something&mdash;you remember her at the inquest,'
  said Gisberne. 'And the fact is, Miss Estorel, she put it to me herself.'</p>

  <p>'To you!'</p>

  <p>'Yes; the morning her husband died. I met her. She'll die of
  it&mdash;that's my idea.' Gisberne's colour began to change; his voice
  hurried.&mdash;' Brooding, you see, she's worked out the notion of foul play,
  and she means to try and bring it home.'</p>

  <p>'She suspects Paul?'</p>

  <p>'She did not say so. Miss Estorel. She left it at that.'</p>

  <p>'And she told you? Why did she tell <i>you</i>?'</p>

  <p>Gisberne faintly smiled; his smile danced in his eyes a moment, then
  suddenly caught his mouth exceedingly pleasantly with a little show of
  admirable teeth. 'I don't know. I wish she hadn't. I suppose I seem the
  outsider who can keep himself impartial.'</p>

  <p>Daphne drew her breath deeply. The terror of her face changed. To Gisberne
  it seemed to brighten, yet to harden; he saw about her the rare, god-like
  expansion she could express, as of wings about to spread or feet stepping
  from the earth, spurning it. She made a gesture of entreaty. 'Will you come
  back with me to Ferriby? There is something I must put to you, ask you. I
  cannot here in the open road.'</p>

  <p>He could have fallen to the ground and kissed her feet, yet he answered
  judicially: 'Only, let us beware of eavesdropping. Miss Estorel. I don't want
  to seem to occupy you too much.'</p>

  <p>'I know! I know! You are considerate in everything. But&mdash;can you
  spare the time?...'</p>

  <p>'I am absolutely at your service...always...'</p>

  <p>They walked on, putting talk aside. Once or twice Daphne laughed, a
  little, bitter, woeful sound.</p>

  <p>Instinctively as a dog, Gisberne guessed her humour. She was tearing at
  her own heart, hurting herself-dragging wounds open. What did she think of
  Mr. Paul Ferriby now!</p>

  <p>'Go more softly. Miss Estorel,' he said gently, as they neared the
  turning.</p>

  <p>She slackened her pace and her tightened grip upon her gown, giving him a
  glance, deprecating, but so sweet, with such gratitude in it, such pain and
  appeal in her whole aspect, expressed, too, with such a flash of friendliness
  that Gisberne, overwhelmed, looked at her, startled, incredulous, as if at
  the beginning of a desperate journey suddenly one should behold the end.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">'What does he mean?' cried Daphne. 'How can he do it? What
is he made of?
  Since the reading of the will he has not spoken to me. <i>Then</i> what was
  it? He defied me, threatened. He will not come into the house-he transacts
  his business with the lawyer. He sends me pencilled memoranda signed with his
  bare name&mdash;'</p>

  <p>She broke off. Those rare bits of paper had been held to her lips, wept
  over, laughed over, read and re-read...</p>

  <p>Gisberne leant over the back of the chair, staring into the
  fire&mdash;save in the burning August noons there were always fires at
  Ferriby. Daphne, her outdoor things put hurriedly off, paced the room.</p>

  <p>'Miss Daphne,' said Gisberne softly, 'what did you expect?'</p>

  <p>She stopped to look towards him, no longer commonplace, even in his
  aspect, in her eyes. She liked him-oh yes, she liked him&mdash;liked him for
  being there, liked him for his pallor, his agitation, obvious, yet so subdued
  and managed. He did things well. He could rise to the occasion, and, for all
  his quiet, his slim form and height&mdash;no greater than her own&mdash;she
  knew his resourcefulness, she had <i>seen</i> his strength. And she could
  open her heart to him as to a brother and comrade in arms.</p>

  <p>'What did I expect?' she echoed. Her voice changed. 'I wanted to save
  him,' she said, with a gesture of shame.</p>

  <p>'Well, you see. Miss Daphne, he's leaving it at that, I suppose. He is not
  going to put himself in <i>anybody's</i> power.'</p>

  <p>She came close to Gisberne's standing place.</p>

  <p>'He left...him...<i>dead</i>.' she said below her breath. 'Who did he
  think took the body away?'</p>

  <p>'Would you have had him come and ask you if you did, Miss Daphne?'</p>

  <p>If she had answered from her soul, she would have answered 'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'He knows someone did,' she said.</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'He knows someone has his knife.'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'There is a rumour stirring. Mrs. Ibimay...Irene Garth...' Daphne's figure
  stiffened, her hands clenched. 'Yesterday, here, in this room, she accused me
  of knowing Paul had done it&mdash;and&mdash;for her sake.'</p>

  <p>Gisberne started violently. 'She said so&mdash;to <i>you</i>?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Then she saw us that night!'</p>

  <p>Gisberne fixed his eyes on her with uncontrollable agitation. Had Irene
  Garth been tricking him?</p>

  <p>'No, no&mdash;reflect!' she cried. 'It was only a bow drawn at a
  venture&mdash;her temper, her spite...She did not see us,' she said in agony.
  'No one did...' She caught his arm, clasping both hands upon it. Her
  passionate face came close to his. The divine fire that takes no heed of
  persons, or what has been or what shall be, but 'goeth where it listeth,'
  flashed through Gisberne's body the power of a man and the ecstasy of a god.
  If he had needed anything to set his face beyond turning, against damnation,
  this moment gave it. He would go on, tell everything, on to win to the glory
  of love he lifted his eyes to above it all.</p>

  <p>'Remember,' said Daphne, close to him, 'the doors were all shut...it was
  so dark...I could not live and think <i>she</i> had seen! And that you should
  be dragged in for helping me...Oh, I was mad!...I was mad!...I should have
  left him alone to answer for what he did. I dragged you in...I did an awful
  thing&mdash;an awful thing! And for what?&mdash;to screen a coward!' She
  threw her head back with a fine gesture of shame and scorn.</p>

  <p>Her silence was ended&mdash;the statue had come to life indeed. She seemed
  to undulate as though in the very flame of it. As one thought after another
  possessed her, she moved her arms, her shoulders, her bosom heaved; she
  clasped and unclasped her hands&mdash;no heroine of tragic calm, no one
  difficult to understand, a woman, fire and softness, beauty and desire...in
  trouble, in love, loving, passionate, tender, weak as water, strong as death,
  capable of anything, impossible to degrade. Robert Gisberne had known no
  woman as Daphne Estorel was woman. He had seen yellow hair flared on in
  saloons, and fair faces tricked out to bargain...he had had woman's care and
  woman's company...that was all. Ecstasy and longing, a passion of gratitude
  towards the Maker of men, a passion of perception, an abandonment of desire
  and yet inexpressible tenderness, adoration, and humility&mdash;he knew now
  that&mdash;<i>this</i> clothed in all that can be imagined of perfection, was
  woman and the love of her.</p>

  <p>'<i>You</i> think him a coward,' cried Daphne. 'You must despise us
  both.'</p>

  <p>Gisberne smiled. In a strange boldness he put his arm about her shoulders.
  He knew she knew she was supreme to him, that even as he touched her he fell
  in spirit to her feet.</p>

  <p>'I am going to take you in hand,' he said, gazing in this new boldness
  calmly into her eyes. 'You must not get these panics. I don't know about Mr.
  Paul being a coward&mdash;it's a large word.' He looked still silently into
  her eyes a moment, gently let her go, and turned back to his former place. 'I
  don't see what he could do,' he went on. 'He could not openly claim your
  connivance, could he? How could he be sure it <i>was</i> your
  connivance?'</p>

  <p>'Who else?' she breathed.</p>

  <p>'Irene Garth. Might he not think <i>she</i>...'</p>

  <p>There was a silence, broken by Daphne's bitter little laugh; the colour
  blazed in her cheeks; her eyes were bright. 'Yes, it would be the way of
  things. But...alone...' Her voice sank; she shuddered as at some horror
  conjured up.</p>

  <p>'What of that maid?'</p>

  <p>'You mean Sophy Bassett?'</p>

  <p>'Yes: a great deal can be done under desperation. It might easily seem to
  Mr. Paul possible that those...two...'</p>

  <p>'Oh, don't, don't!' she winced. She covered her eyes, threw her hands out,
  moved here and there in the restlessness of pain. 'And he goes on his way in
  silence...' she said at last.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps he may not be silent with Miss Garth, Miss Daphne.'</p>

  <p>'They understand one another, you mean, in keeping silent?' She turned on
  him sharply.</p>

  <p>'It is just possible, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>Just possible they should understand one another&mdash;Paul and Irene
  Garth&mdash;she for whom and for whose beauty's sake he had bound himself, as
  Jacob for Rachel, and served as a hind in the fields...Daphne moved away and
  turned her face from Gisberne's eyes. 'He speaks to no one,' she said
  faintly...</p>

  <p>'He may write to her. Oh, I'm only proposing it as a theory, Miss Daphne.
  But if it came to inquiry, his only excuse would be his infatuation for Miss
  Garth...That, past or present, secret or open, <i>must</i> be left him to
  save him.'</p>

  <p>She did not move or speak. When he trusted himself to look towards her he
  saw the blood had ebbed from her face. She moved slowly back to the fire. 'I
  took that night upon my soul,' she said intensely, 'and let <i>you</i> take
  it, too, <i>for nothing</i>.'</p>

  <p>She half held out, sorrowfully, a deprecating hand. His closed round it
  instantly. 'That night you did the only thing possible,' he said, 'for anyone
  in your place. And so did I. For the rest, you cannot imagine what it is to
  me to&mdash;' He could trust himself no further.</p>

  <p>With the grace and restraint of emotion as true as it was strong, daring
  all because forgetting all, Gisberne bowed his head down to the hand he held.
  Daphne drew it away very gently.</p>

  <p>'You are a wonderful friend,' she murmured brokenly, 'as long as
  <i>you</i> do not desert me...only,' she added unconsciously, 'it is so
  unfair to you&mdash;so wretched a position.'</p>

  <p>He either moved at that or spoke&mdash;he did not know; something of the
  tumult of his heart escaped him. Their eyes flashed together, and Daphne's
  unconsciousness was gone. Yet, instantly, before she could as much as start
  away from the inevitable, he had controlled it so naturally and with such
  good effect that she did not rely on him the less and liked him the more.</p>

  <p>'Hush!' said Gisberne gently, as she seemed about to to speak. He had
  heard what might have passed as inaudible. They moved apart. In another
  instant Sophy Bassett entered to ask if Miss Estorel would dine that
  evening.</p>

  <p>'No,' said Daphne; 'no, I will take something by and-by. Ask Susan to
  bring coffee at once!' When the door had closed again she looked at Gisberne.
  'I left orders I should not dine to-night, that if Mrs. Ibimay came home with
  me she would go at once to her room. Solomon must have told them I was
  alone.'</p>

  <p>'No; he told them you were with me,' said Gisberne quietly. 'That girl
  came on Miss Garth's suggestion, to eavesdrop or spy...She confided in me
  yesterday that&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Daphne broke in with a cry: '<i>She</i>! Oh no...' She struck her hands
  together in an excited, half-laughing amazement. 'It is too much that she
  should be talking to you, too. I cannot have that...I am
  selfish...jealous...<i>I</i> want your help...'</p>

  <p>'Ah, but,' he answered delicately, careful not to notice, to take no
  advantage even in his tone, 'for that reason! Miss Garth is not to be
  trusted. I think I should like to keep her in view.'</p>

  <p>She looked at him vacantly, silently adjusting things. They were too
  much&mdash;too many. She gave a laugh of sheer and woeful helplessness and
  sat down, leaning back and pressing her eyes with her hand. 'I can't see my
  way; I can't see what will happen,' she said. 'I have put it out of his power
  to defend himself. If an inquiry is raised, if Mrs. Ibimay, if Irene...I have
  put it out...of...his...power...'</p>

  <p>Her hand fell to her lap; the eyes looked up piteously with a sudden
  access of realization; he saw her lips whiten.</p>

  <p>'No, no,' he said hastily. 'Remember they are bringing coffee. Miss
  Daphne.' His own breath was coming short and fast. 'He put it out of his own
  power,' he went on, 'by going away, by not being there when you called...At
  the inquest...he said nothing, you know...he'd heard nothing, you know...he
  lied as well as we...'</p>

  <p>'What can be done?' she whispered,</p>

  <p>'Ah, you must compose yourself,' he answered. 'A chance word or look when
  talk is flying is like fire in straw. Miss Daphne.'</p>

  <p>He looked round. Part of the fitting of the beautiful old room was a
  spinet, a thing of fairy-like faintness of colour and delicacy against the
  dark wall. He sat down to it. When Susan entered with the coffee Mr. Gisberne
  was making music of a wonderful, fine, thin sweetness scarcely to be heard,
  and Miss Daphne sat listening sadly, as she might well, just back from Fulbec
  and a funeral. The woman set things in order, tended the fire, received
  Daphne's beautiful smile, and closed the two in again. The doors at Ferriby
  were hard on listeners. Once shut, no more could penetrate than through the
  wall.</p>

  <p>But Gisberne played on.</p>

  <p>'Come,' said Daphne gently, at last. 'Coffee is nothing if not hot.' Then
  he came across the room and stood looking down on her. The attractive,
  ordinary face, the pleasant, quiet manner, seemed to offer an assurance
  against disaster, somebody who stood for all the friendliness and ease and
  joy outside this little spot of tragedy.</p>

  <p>'Your playing affects me very much,' she said, 'even half-dumb like that.'
  Her lips were trembling, her eyes full of tears. 'What were you playing?'</p>

  <p>He smiled at her. 'You may know, I don't. Please don't move. May I fill a
  cup for you?'</p>

  <p>She took it from him. He remained the other side of the table, knowing he
  was dreaming, but letting the dream go on, knowing he was not.</p>

  <p>And curious elation seized him, triumph, confidence in himself. The dream
  should not end yet nor any waking change it.</p>

  <p>'You are very tired,' he said presently. 'I am always at your service. I
  will come again to-morrow, any time, but you must not have too much. Can't
  you put it on to my shoulders?...Trust to me. Your part is silence. Not a
  word, a look. And thank you always,' he said, bending towards her, 'for the
  trust you have given me...for the way you treat me...'</p>

  <p>She rose swiftly and looked into his eyes unflinchingly, and with a brave
  liking. Let what may of it come, her attitude, her marvel at him could not be
  stayed.</p>

  <p>'You must not say that,' she breathed, 'or you will seem to mock me. Do
  you think I don't realize? I ask myself every hour of the day what would have
  happened without your help. Paul Ferriby would be in jail now, in danger of
  his life...I keep my senses together thinking of you. If you had not come
  back I should have searched the world for you...It may all come to light
  still, and then I shall come to you again <i>to help me save a coward</i>,'
  His eyes were on her, his breath bated to catch her very breaths. He saw her
  senses half-swooned under her steady words...' You see, I...have put it out
  of his power to defend himself.'</p>

  <p>His arm closed round her to sustain her. He felt her heart beat, her body
  touching his. She moved away, but motioned to him not to leave her. Her soul
  must be unburdened.</p>

  <p>'He is a coward,' she said faintly. 'He screens himself, without a word, a
  sign, behind&mdash;women!'</p>

  <p>Gisberne saw her eyes grow dim, her lips grow so white that the words came
  dry and faint as from a distance. His instinct, guiding him swiftly forward,
  told him that her utterance of these words in his hearing, her taking them
  and laying them, as it were, across Paul's name, a bar sinister, that
  dishonoured passion and disfigured even crime, would rank as the one
  unforgivable thing should she ever discover the truth.</p>

  <p>But it had been said. She saw something in his eyes she read as pity, and
  turned away from it blindly.</p>

  <p>'I can't believe it,' she whispered. 'Look at him, think of him...He
  cannot be a coward...'</p>

  <p>'His life is at stake...What is there but silence?'</p>

  <p>'I know'&mdash;she kept her back to him&mdash;'only there must be
  something I do not understand. He cannot be a coward.' It was no statement,
  only a desperate appeal, the last evidence a woman could give of the utterly
  womanly, the final touch of a supreme trust.</p>

  <p>Should he respond? He knew how. She inspired him; step by step he mounted,
  answering every test. Yet it was a risk. To utter what was in his mind, to
  raise himself still higher in her estimation, to come still nearer to her, he
  must take a deadly risk.</p>

  <p>If he weakened her contempt of Paul he was staking his own perilous
  safety. The gambler in him hesitated. But to see her eyes turn on him in
  their beauty, on him, for him&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Miss Daphne,' he said softly. 'Mr. Paul may not <i>know</i> he killed his
  cousin.'</p>

  <p>Once it was uttered it seemed to Gisberne the quiet room grew curiously
  still, as if his pulses and his breath had stopped, and hers. The words had
  pierced her heart, it seemed. She was so motionless.</p>

  <p>Then her sweet, bright face flashed round on him. He saw she was half
  holding out her arms.</p>

  <p>'Don't you see,' he said, 'he knocked him down and left him. He imagines
  there was recovery...and the rest really accident as it appeared.'</p>

  <p>She kept still a long moment.</p>

  <p>'And the knife?'</p>

  <p>'Ah, I haven't thought it out. I only offer you that to comfort you.'</p>

  <p>She seemed about to sink before him like a falling wave, then she caught
  his hands. A lovely colour showed in her cheeks, her eyes met his in a
  speechless wonder and tender feeling.</p>

  <p>'You are splendid,' she said softly, as she had said the night of his
  return. 'Murder&mdash;ah, but <i>not</i> cowardice, too. How came I not to
  think of it?'</p>

  <p>'It's only a notion of mine,' he said quickly, 'and, in any case, don't
  make too much of its being cowardice. Miss Daphne. Women are rather rough on
  men there. It's his life...There's no safety if there isn't silence.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At Gisberne's side, as he walked his lonely three miles
back to Droitlet,
  the vision of Daphne Estorel went all the way. If at first he had been drawn
  to her as a dog without a master to someone who will recognize he has his
  qualities; if that night he had helped her in his own self-defence; if he had
  returned, attracted like the prodigal son, by some remembrance of brightness
  and home, his feeling now was the love of man for woman in the completest
  sense.</p>

  <p>She was more woman than Irene Garth&mdash;she, that still, bright-faced
  vision he had played to the day of his arrival. The firmness and decision of
  that night when he had seen her over Ferriby's dead body had broken into
  infinite colour, fire, and softness, like some rich bloom breaking from a
  pale, closed sheath.</p>

  <p>She was weaker far than Irene, but with what a difference. Passionate, but
  ah, how infinitely kind! That she loved Paul Ferriby did not daunt Gisberne's
  thoughts of her. His feeling encircled everything that appertained to her,
  even her passion for another man.</p>

  <p>The bright vision stayed beside him, and he felt no misgiving, only an
  incredible uplifting.</p>

  <p>He sighed with overburdened ecstasy. At the turning into Droitlet, where
  he met the first smiting of the sea, he stopped. She seemed to be there. He
  looked up at the stars, round him into the quiet dark. If he had ever recked
  of God or a recording angel, he might think of them now. If he had ever
  walked in slippery places, he had cause to reflect to-night upon his
  foothold. He thought alone of Daphne. He breathed her name, and the blood
  rushed in boyish fashion into his cheeks. He opened his arms to the air that
  held her imagined shape. He towered in himself, high as heaven, far above all
  his ignoble deeds. Come one, come all! He was as great as the greatest, as
  worthy as the worthiest.</p>

  <p>Gisberne had read no poetry: he lived it now. No legend or romance would
  have sounded to him less than true. The stars explained themselves. If his
  thoughts rose beyond them to the Infinite, it was with perfect trust that
  Irene Garth would not betray him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-10"
     id="ch-2-10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">Daphne received the news of his arrival on a few hours'
visit with a sense
  of the inexpressibly strange.</p>

  <p>Letters, condolences, congratulations, these had reached her from the
  outside world, not strong enough, though, to break the spell.</p>

  <p>A personality is a different matter. For the first time since that night
  she was to be brought to the bar of the actual eyes of the world. She was
  concealing murder and her own connivance. The alternative, an always present
  underlying dread, was the accusation of Paul Ferriby from outside with the
  result of thwarted, disfigured love and ruined lives. And her only way
  between these burdens was the way of silence. Silence was comparatively easy
  in the largeness and repose and isolated luxury of Ferriby. The silence of
  love and danger seemed natural in the house over which Jane Skidfell's silent
  figure brooded, and which housed an understood enemy in the person of Irene
  Garth; but with the unexpected arrival of someone from outside the charmed
  circle of suspense, Daphne Estorel suddenly saw, felt, realized that this
  silence was her portion for life or death, to be carried with her everywhere,
  among old friends and new faces, and into trials and scenes unguessed at. She
  asked herself if she were equal to it. Paul Ferriby stood remote, the figure
  of a dream. She had connived at his crime, she supported his silence, but
  also in silence. He could never come nearer. Her love, in a long swoon of
  terror and amazement at him and herself, she thought would die. If that
  night's work should be brought to light she must die, but it might be with
  shame and horror at her share in it, not of love, she told herself. Sir
  William came as a sudden reminder, smiting unbidden into these weeks of
  strain and seclusion. She and her secret would have to adapt themselves to
  other surroundings, to a whole host of temptations that might lead her to
  betrayal or lure her to forget. Had she it in her to do either? Here was a
  first slight test. Her thoughts flew to Robert Gisberne. She found a singular
  excitement in bringing him to the touch. To-day she and he together would
  face the ordeal of being ordinary people in the eyes of an ordinary person,
  nothing in common and nothing concealed. Who knew how soon they might have to
  face it together, in far larger surroundings, to tremendous issues?</p>

  <p>Sir William had arrived from Petsham an hour before luncheon. Daphne,
  writing a hasty note, dispatched it by a mounted messenger to Droitlet. She
  begged Gisberne to join her and an unexpected visitor. In writing she
  experienced the satisfaction of power&mdash;a strange and fascinating thrill.
  She had power over Robert Gisberne. She could conjure him from the far ends
  of the earth. He was hers to command. As Devil Ferriby's stolen wooing had
  coloured the days for Irene Garth, so the thought of Gisberne, with her
  secret in his heart, sustained Daphne Estorel. She said 'Go,' and he went;
  'Come,' and he came.</p>

  <p>Facing Sir William Evered an hour or so later as he took his seat at table
  under the painted commemoration window in the dining-hall was a correctly
  dressed, unpretentiously attractive-looking man. Daphne noticed, she knew not
  with what of curious sensations, that Sir William took his fellow-guest as a
  matter of course. In such a house and household as the Grange anomalies might
  be looked for. Yet the visitor did not apparently take Mr. Gisberne as one.
  In satisfying herself with her accomplice Daphne forgot her own liabilities,
  and so behaved completely naturally. Gisberne did not shine. He acknowledged
  briefly once or twice to want of information&mdash;and inexpressibly strange
  in Daphne's ears was the visitor's light chatter and careless
  anecdote&mdash;but his manner was invulnerable. He passed through the meal
  exactly and as easily as the man opposite him.</p>

  <p>'I am mad,' thought Daphne suddenly. 'With what there is between us I am
  noticing how he holds his table-napkin and breaks his bread!' And yet, why
  not? If Gisberne were to be always near, her eyes always on him...</p>

  <p>Neither Irene Garth nor Paul Ferriby was present. At the foot of the table
  sat Mistress Skidfell, stately in her stern silence, taking no part in the
  meal, the old family appanage to whom Daphne paid half-fetish honour. If Sir
  William found this an anomaly, he understood it easily.</p>

  <p>'But why the other man?' he asked later, with a humorous glance at Daphne.
  'Is Mistress Skidfell deaf? Were you afraid I should renew my proposal of
  marriage at the luncheon-table? My dear child, no...' He went off upon
  another topic&mdash;and her heart beat to think how easily&mdash;away from
  Gisberne. 'You have now the open door. I am not wanted in your life. What are
  you going to do with your life. Miss Daphne?'</p>

  <p>She was showing her rare visitor over the yards and outbuildings. Robert
  Gisberne, not even questioning her with his eyes, had taken his leave. Irene
  Garth was absent. Daphne thought Paul was also. All at once she saw him cross
  the rickyard. All at once there was only this again in the whole matter: she
  loved him.</p>

  <p>'Is that Paul Ferriby?' exclaimed Sir William, as if much struck.</p>

  <p>An encounter was inevitable. Paul would have passed with the merest
  gesture of recognition, but Sir William interfered. He had heard a whisper in
  Petsham&mdash;he wanted a look straight into the young man's face.</p>

  <p>At Paul's heels lurched a great dog with dropping head.</p>

  <p>'Sick, eh, what?' said Sir William. 'Never saw a finer face,' he was
  thinking. 'Don't know that it would acquit him, though. That's the famous
  whip-mark on it, eh?'</p>

  <p>Daphne, mechanically, blindly, only knowing Paul near, and fire before her
  eyes, mad joy in her heart, stooped to the creature and laid her hand upon
  its head. A howl broke from the dog. The great jaws came up, showing the
  fangs and the bloodshot eyes, agonized. The bristles rose. Paul caught at the
  collar.</p>

  <p>'Why, what's the matter with him?' cried Sir William, snatching Daphne
  back.</p>

  <p>The howl prolonged itself, rose, broke hideously.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-11"
     id="ch-2-11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">Sir William was gone. As he disappeared, with him went the
faint shadow of
  regret his coming had brought.</p>

  <p>'Come South!' Sir William said before he had seen Paul Ferriby; but he did
  not repeat it. Daphne Estorel was young, very much a woman after all,
  seemingly; this Paul was a 'prince among men,' and no nonsense about it. The
  visitor had glanced from one to the other, and, for good or for ill, there
  was only one thing could befall, that was plain.</p>

  <p>Man of the world and seasoned traveller, thinking on this, he glanced back
  over the years and what they had brought of pleasure and achievement and the
  joy of work, and he sighed. He would say no more to Daphne about leaving
  Ferriby with the swallows. Travel and society, even intensest interest in his
  fellow men, even praise and glitter and laughter and devilry, even days
  consecrated to what-not of unselfishness and devotion&mdash;Sir William knew
  that, putting them all in the balance, they weighed lighter than love. He
  knew that all our doings, like a banquet with an empty chair, leave a vacancy
  for the lord of life and of experience.</p>

  <p>It could make small difference that Ferriby was threatened with ugly
  whispers. One can whisper long in these isolated regions.</p>

  <p>'Your home is beautiful,' he said to Daphne. 'Don't forget if Mistress
  Skidfell should not seem enough, my Cousin Letitia will always come. If you
  are in doubt about anything, don't hesitate. Seek outside judgment at once.
  Come to me.'</p>

  <p>Daphne read into this easily that the rumour of which Gisberne had warned
  her had caught Sir William's ear, but she let him go without a word or sign,
  undaunted. Since the meeting with Paul her love was again in pulsing life;
  she felt feverish elation.</p>

  <p>Sir William, on his way to the South, to far countries, wide seas, big
  ideas, and many people, was, after all, the one going back to unsubstantial
  visions; the reality was here in this narrow compass in the shadow of
  Ferriby.</p>

  <p>She walked slowly back towards it. She had waved her last good-bye to her
  visitor where the high road joined, and had watched him out of sight
  vacantly, her mind already back with that encounter in the yard, and Paul's
  voice, his dark, noble face. As she retraced her steps she heard, even at
  that distance, the moan of the sick dog. Pity thrilled her for an animal in
  distress, but in her mood of the moment she hailed the sound. It summoned her
  to Paul; it was a reference to that night that must provoke from him some
  acknowledgment&mdash;a glance, a tone.</p>

  <p>So had the sudden speech and contact with him moved her that the mutual
  connivance that a few hours ago had seemed to make everything impossible
  seemed to her quickened passion now as nothing. She could say to him:&mdash;'
  Paul...I know. It makes no difference. I stand beside you equally
  guilty.'</p>

  <p>She passed the garden gate and on through the great doors of the yard. The
  dog was now silent.</p>

  <p>'Where is Mr. Ferriby?' she asked a boy sweeping up litter.</p>

  <p>He touched his forehead, staring. 'In t' coach-house, missus,' he
  said,&mdash;' wi' t' dog.'</p>

  <p>The huge black doors were closed. Daphne crossed to them and knocked. The
  thrill and awful sublimity of the night of the murder touched her; she drew
  herself up, with head high and ready eyes.</p>

  <p>The big panel was opened by Scarside, astonished to see her. 'I have come
  to inquire about the dog,' said Daphne. At her voice a couple of men bending
  over the creature started up and looked round. Miss Estorel was almost a
  stranger to the new hands. They thought for a moment this must be Miss Garth;
  they'd heard tell of Miss Garth. They fixed their eyes as men do on women
  outside their reach&mdash;almost their admiration-and stood aside
  respectfully. There, farthest from her, against the wall, stooping. Daphne
  was very conscious, was Paul; she was conscious, too, of herself, her
  girlhood, her perfection of appearance, and warm loveliness. Love enfolded
  her in its glory and held her hand, and she felt neither terror nor
  shame.</p>

  <p>'The dog is really ill?' she asked, advancing.</p>

  <p>'He has had a fit,' said Paul, rising. 'He is better now.
  Scarside&mdash;'</p>

  <p>But the dog leapt to its feet. As Daphne stood before it again, the head
  went up and the howl came forth, ending in sobbing exhaustion.</p>

  <p>'You are strange to it. Miss Estorel,' said Paul. Scarside was looking at
  him queerly. Strange to a dog she had handled as a pup! 'Perhaps you had
  better not stay,' he added.</p>

  <p>She needed no second bidding to go. As she walked back to the house the
  dog's howl dropped to moans behind her, then to utter silence. She could have
  moaned, too. Her blood was chilled, and the glory she had momentarily moved
  in gone. She was trembling with a strange inexpressible sensation of fear.
  Paul had spoken to her icily; he had not raised his eyes to hers.</p>

  <p>She returned unthinkingly to the dining-hall. Here there were still traces
  of her visitor. How unreal, far off, Sir William seemed! In a chair by the
  fire sat Jane Skidfell, her mittened hands folded in her lap, her face rigid
  in abstraction.</p>

  <p>Daphne paced to and fro. She unpinned her hat, and tossed it on to a seat.
  A convex mirror in gold-balled frame, hung between the windows, showed her
  her black figure and golden head, grotesque and at the end of a long vista.
  She tumbled her hair with her hands. Her cheeks began to burn and something
  to rise in her throat and suffocate her. She flung open a window giving on
  the misty dusk of the old pleasaunce. She felt she must shout&mdash;scream,
  when a servant's voice spoke suddenly from the open door:</p>

  <p>'Mr. Ferriby would like to speak to you a moment, miss.'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' her heart cried. 'Bring him here, Susan,' she said, and wondered if
  her voice had betrayed her. And she heard his every footfall,
  coming...coming...to her.</p>

  <p>Paul had not crossed the threshold of Ferriby since the reading of the
  will. He had not been in this part of the house for years. He paused on the
  threshold and looked round on the place, swept and garnished. The silver
  gleamed in plentiful display. There were flowers to-day. By the majestic
  hearth sat the transformation of his boyhood's tyrant, the apotheosis of Jane
  Skidfell! And seated in the deep window-sill at the far end of the room,
  Daphne Estorel leaned her golden head against the polished shutter and eyed
  him strangely. She looked like a siren, not a saint. Paul's mouth set itself
  firmly in that little touch of cruelty. Jane took no heed of his entrance. At
  a movement from Daphne he crossed to her&mdash;with a fine air. He had flung
  the slouch off mighty easily. Where was his sullenness? Had the whip-mark
  gone too? Daphne leaned towards him; she had to hold herself back, lest she
  fell to her knees and clasped him to her.</p>

  <p>'Will you sit down?' she said.</p>

  <p>'Thank you, it's scarcely worth while. That dog&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Yes.' She looked up at him intently.</p>

  <p>'I think&mdash;had he not better be shot? I came for your permission.'</p>

  <p>'Permission?'</p>

  <p>'The dog is yours, a valuable creature and splendidly trained.'</p>

  <p>Her eyes fell from his, hard and unrelenting as stone. The deadly fear
  came back fumbling about her heart.</p>

  <p>'Will it not get better?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'It may, yes. But you don't want an animal about that howls, do you, Miss
  Estorel?&mdash;howls at night&mdash;howls at sight of you?' His tone was
  marked.</p>

  <p>She rose, looking at him steadily,</p>

  <p>'Does it matter his howling at me?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'That is just as you like,' he half laughed.</p>

  <p>'Cannot he be sent away? Must he be killed?' She spoke blindly, feeling
  incredulous of him or her own senses.</p>

  <p>'He won't stand any sending away, I fancy. His nerve has gone. Besides,
  I'm sorry for him. He's breaking his heart for his master. That
  night&mdash;he found him, you know. <i>He must have seen him fall</i>.'</p>

  <p>It came too suddenly. Daphne gasped, and caught at a support.</p>

  <p>'You <i>want</i> him shot,' she said, with short sharp breath. 'But it's
  only at me he howls.'</p>

  <p>Paul looked at her with an open and a keen inquiry in his dark eyes. Utter
  bewilderment and utter fear unnerved her.</p>

  <p>'Do as you think best,' she said, unable to conceal agitation...' If the
  dog is suffering&mdash;would you do it yourself?'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes.'</p>

  <p>She turned away, hiding her face. 'Do as you think best,' she
  repeated.</p>

  <p>He waited a moment and then she heard him leave her. A moment she
  hesitated, only to follow him swiftly to the door.</p>

  <p>'One moment,' she cried; and he turned instantly, waiting. In piteous
  self-abasement she loved him that he even turned at her voice. She noticed
  the wave of his hair, and her eyes seemed to draw the beauty of the smooth
  brown cheek and lips and chin and throat into her very soul. His eyes dwelt
  questioningly on her.</p>

  <p>'Paul,' she breathed. She did not know what her tone conveyed, but she
  knew she meant it to carry to him something wherewith to bridge the silence,
  something to tell him that he might, that she <i>invited</i> him to take the
  mask off, at least in his eyes when they were meeting hers&mdash;for pity,
  for pity's sake!</p>

  <p>'It just occurs to me,' he said: 'I am taking up my quarters at Girdle's
  Cot. The dog can come there with me. I'll see what I can do.' He murmured a
  'Good-evening,' and turned on his heel.</p>

  <p>This was all...</p>

  <p>'No, no, no, no!' Daphne said it to herself incessantly, falling again to
  her walking up and down. 'No, no!' She would not have it. There could not be
  anything so awful. She denied her chill agony of fear. She would not have it.
  She had put herself into eternal bondage for Paul Ferriby, and she was
  nothing to him! That was death in life, but the madness on which she had
  built a notion of anything different was the <i>agony</i> of death!</p>

  <p>No, no! She put it from her. Why had she imagined that, because she loved
  Paul, he loved her? On what grounds had she been persuading herself he was
  really hers? Whence had come her hope that Irene Garth had passed from his
  life?</p>

  <p>She shared his crime, and he looked at her with eyes that warned her,
  whatever secret she hid, she might bear the burden of it&mdash;alone for him.
  He owned to nothing, but bore himself towards her as to an enemy, as
  <i>she</i> might to Irene Garth.</p>

  <p>Irene Garth! He was silent for Irene's sake. He had killed John Ferriby
  for Irene's sake. Irene had seen her and Gisberne bear away the body, and had
  told Paul. It was Paul's silence and Irene Garth's linked against hers and
  Gisberne's. And why did he think she was silent, bribing Gisberne? Irene
  would make that plain to him, too. If any look had slipped into view behind
  the coldness of Paul Ferriby's eyes it would have been one of pitying scorn.
  He defied her. He knew his crime and his motive. He defied her share in it.
  He scorned her for it. He used it and scorned it!</p>

  <p>'No, no, no!' Daphne reiterated it. It was unbearable. She put the agony
  from her&mdash;or she must die that moment, and give him so much more
  advantage. She paced to and fro, staring. She did not know she breathed. Her
  heart shrank together to hide itself&mdash;to ward off the repetition of the
  stab. 'No, no, no!...' she muttered.</p>

  <p>'What ails thee, child?' said Jane Skidfell's voice. 'Wor that Paul
  Ferriby here just now?'</p>

  <p>Paul Ferriby! The name pierced her so that Daphne thought she must expire.
  She went to Jane's side and kneeling there, put the softness of her ice-cold
  cheek against the withered face. She held the gaunt, rigid form in the
  unconscious grip of her fierce pain.</p>

  <p>'Am I your daughter?' she said.</p>

  <p>The old woman put her from her. 'Nay, nay, thee art not. Not that thee
  might not ha' been so for me. He did as he pleased: he wor t' <i>master</i>.'
  The old eyes looked with their grim keenness deep into the young ones, wide
  and dimmed with anguish.</p>

  <p>'Paul Ferriby,' said the old woman again. 'He ha' done it right enough. I
  warned un. He wor t' master's son. I warned un of Paul. Bloodshed!
  Bloodshed!'</p>

  <p>'Hush!' cried Daphne. 'Hush!' and clasped her close.</p>

  <p>'I know t' heart in thee,' said Jane after a long stillness and in a
  changed voice. 'I ha' guessed it long. The Ferribys bean't men to
  overlook.'</p>

  <p>A cry broke from Daphne. Her hold dropped and she sank, her face downwards
  on the old woman's knee. Her golden hair, gathered high, showed her white
  neck, bare as if before the descending knife, and Jane Skidfell's figure rose
  behind her like an image of austere and pitiless fate. But after a while the
  old servant's knotted hand crept to the bowed head and caressed it gently. 'I
  canna weep,' she said in a troubled whisper-' I canna tak' heed more of ony
  of it. But let me tell thee, ma lass, an' let it comfort thee if it can...I'm
  afeared o' death, afeared <i>because</i> I be no sinner such as t' master.
  Dost 'ee grasp it? <i>Afeared</i> o' Heaven. T' master...I'm fain to see f
  master...This side o' death I hae his memory. I'm afeared to be separate even
  fro' that by godliness. Oh, I'm fain to see t' master.'</p>

  <p>The trembling voice rose and strengthened. 'He wor an evil man. I pray t'
  A'mighty not to forget agin me I wor once his&mdash;soul and body. I'm fain
  to see him. I ha' sinned too. Let it not be forgot...I ha' sinned too...' The
  words fell upon a silence, the very awfulness, terror and sublimity of human
  love. After a long while Daphne shuddered and sobbed. She took Jane's hand in
  hers and kissed it passionately.</p>

  <p>'Thee understands,' whispered Jane, rising. 'He ha' done it, but t' lad in
  t' grave would laugh to see how well he carries it. Ferriby for a Ferriby. He
  be one.'</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-12"
     id="ch-2-12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">Gisberne wanted money. It was strange how that fact met
him. No matter to
  what heights his burning fancies climbed, the need of money was there
  awaiting and mocking him. He trod air these days, pined, burned, gloried, and
  had to remember money. By some curious affinity his eyes were for ever
  catching some passionate poem, some passage from a book he did not know was
  in the world, and he felt every word, every line&mdash;he knew it true, and
  there was no wonder in it to him. He had written them himself: he found them
  in his own soul and blood. And then he wanted money. To remain here, near
  Daphne, and watch events and seize his moment, even if from death and
  damnation themselves, meant that he must have money. There were two issues to
  the event: one stretching into the years, the other short, sharp, and
  decisive. Nothing pointed to the former save a chance that even his bland
  inconsequence could not believe in; but to the bringing about of a speedy
  climax went a threefold danger: Irene Garth, rumour coming to a head through
  Mrs. Ibimay, an understanding between Daphne and Paul&mdash;this least to be
  feared of all.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Gisberne trod on air, and knew no fears' He remained in
  Droitlet, and it was noticed there that Mr. Gisberne had a new way with
  himself&mdash;a feeling, indeed, amounting to liking of him spread in the
  hamlet. The fishermen talked to him of Devil Ferriby, and did not conceal
  from him the whispers about Mr. Paul.</p>

  <p>His luck again! Yet Gisberne felt himself&mdash;nay, knew himself&mdash;at
  the end of it: his wretched, commonplace, despicable luck. Such a thing as
  his love for a woman could not happen and his old luck run on&mdash;the
  gambler in him knew that.</p>

  <p>His passion for Daphne must have expression. He must have money. To bring
  about these two things he foresaw pretty clearly was himself to bring about
  the end. Daphne herself was hastening it. He had been away to raise the few
  pounds to take him on from day to day&mdash;for the first time he cursed his
  pettifogging ways that brought him so low and safe an interest&mdash;and on
  his return she had been glad to see him, holding out both her hands, hurrying
  across the room. She told him the story of the dog&mdash;crying. She told
  him, with face bowed and turned from his sight, that she believed Paul
  screened Irene, and that they both knew&mdash;a secret against a secret,
  silence against silence, Paul's and Irene's against his and hers.</p>

  <p>'I could make her mine,' thought Gisberne as he went away. 'She is so much
  a woman, so passionate, so good, so weak, so kind&mdash;a child, a
  darling...I believe that I could make her mine.'</p>

  <p>It did not enter his head that she might love and long for Paul even as he
  loved and longed for her. <i>Her</i> feelings he imagined within his power to
  include and comfort&mdash;and as concerned his own, his thoughts returned to
  him finding no resting-place outside the one desire.</p>

  <p>Daphne Estorel was now alone at the Grange. Irene Garth, taking Sophy
  Bassett with her, had removed to a cottage in Droitlet.</p>

  <p>Here once more there was something in his favour. In thought of Irene
  Garth, however, Gisberne found foreboding. He dismounted at the inn where he
  lodged, and, without entering, went to an encounter with her.</p>

  <p>The place where she had settled herself faced the sea, standing alone and
  a little apart. It was a cottage once furnished by Devil Ferriby and kept for
  his own uses. Stories were told of his doings there in earlier days that
  would pass in time into the legends of the place.</p>

  <p>'What made you come over here?' asked Gisberne gently. Sophy Bassett had
  withdrawn with her sewing into an adjoining room. The doors of passage and
  parlour stood open on the light clatter and bustle of unsophisticated
  housework, carried out by a gaunt, capable figure of Jane Skidfell's
  generation.</p>

  <p>The window of the parlour faced a grey sea, placid under a soft sky, and a
  stretch of low whitewashed seawall, against which stout flowers showed a
  yellow blossom, a commonplace, unsuggestive scene enough, savouring of peace
  and resignation. Only Irene did not fit it. She lay back opposite to him in
  the cheap wicker chair, the centre of a mass of tumbled softness. She had
  been playing on the cracked piano, turning a Shakespeare over, smoking. Cards
  and a banjo were on the shabby sofa. Some white sewing in process of
  construction lay on the table. Her hair was half loose, and at every motion
  her sleeves fell back from her arms.</p>

  <p>'I am only here for the moment,' she said. 'I could not stand sleeping
  over that room. I am writing to my father's friends...I suppose I shall go on
  the stage.'</p>

  <p>Gisberne felt his heart leap. For a breath the vision dazzled him of her
  going her way&mdash;<i>alone</i>, unguarded, letting him be, forgetting.</p>

  <p>But he knew her eyes were resting on him, noting, holding him. The
  sublimities and fire of his emotions gave something notable to his
  good-looking face. Gisberne had seen it there himself. It struck him, and the
  thought roused fear, that she was seeing it, too. If she should begin to like
  him, if she should once grow jealous!...</p>

  <p>'You will succeed on the stage,' he said. 'It is your career. You will be
  famous. Have you made any arrangements at all?'</p>

  <p>He knew his words were idle. She rose, closed the door&mdash;too gently to
  be noticed&mdash;and came back to her seat. Her face had changed.</p>

  <p>'I say that,' she said&mdash;' I talk like that before Sophy and others,
  but...I don't think I am going away&mdash;I dare not, I cannot. Cousin John
  haunts me...I dare not trust myself to go away...One day, when I am least
  thinking...just as I least want to...I shall blurt out the whole story...I
  shall scream out the truth...'</p>

  <p>And she rose, excited even as she spoke, her eyes fixed on him, her hand
  at her throat, ready...But it was only a breath. She turned away with a
  dreary laugh, her natural self. 'I don't want to drag <i>you</i> in,' she
  said. 'I ought to hate and denounce you. I miss Cousin John&mdash;I cannot
  tell you how I miss him...I suppose there are other men...'</p>

  <p>She waited for him to speak. Gisberne sat still, his hands dropping
  between his knees, his gloves lightly swaying in them, his gaze on the
  sea.</p>

  <p>'Paul and I have done with one another. I have an idea he rather hates me
  because he <i>did not</i> kill Cousin John. You know what I mean. Anyhow,
  there it is. I don't want to blurt it out. It wouldn't do me any good, nor
  anybody, now...Only I keep seeing it...'</p>

  <p>Gisberne looked round at her. She turned to meet his glance and read it
  instantly.</p>

  <p>'I'm not mad,' she said&mdash;' nothing can make me out that. It's
  hysteria, I suppose.' She came back to him slowly and laid her hand on his
  shoulder. 'I wonder why I feel as I do?' she said softly. 'I can touch you,
  like you. I thought I had done it...He was horribly brutal...I have suffered
  horribly...He deserved it...But you don't know how I miss him. I must have
  someone in my life who cares for me.' She sank to her knees beside him. 'Be
  my friend,' she whispered. 'When you are there I don't feel it. I don't
  <i>want</i> to speak...I can make money. Look at me. I could be famous. Be
  kind to me. Help me.'</p>

  <p>As a man swimming for dear life feels the clutch that in a second more
  will be a dead weight, so Gisberne felt Irene's words. It was the end, it was
  his destruction. He had the gambler's instinct to know when he was beaten. He
  had expected something of this&mdash;not quite so soon, perhaps&mdash;he had
  foreseen it.</p>

  <p>Hysteria?&mdash;yes, and her own nature to prompt the remedy. It was in
  his mind to kill her as he felt her palpitating body against his arm, heard
  the sweetness of her voice in an inexorable bargain: himself or his
  destruction.</p>

  <p>Kill her? A senseless thought. He must keep the road clear between himself
  and Daphne a little longer.</p>

  <p>Daphne! He moved his gaze from the sea, and his eyes half smiled into
  Irene's lovely face. To argue would be as useless as to strangle. He would
  have strangled in cold blood, for she roused not even rage. Her eyes met his,
  limpid and flower-like and beseeching.</p>

  <p>'You do not need my help,' he said. 'There is a world of people to help
  such as you.'</p>

  <p>'No,' she answered. 'I am much older than I seem. I understand much more
  than I suppose I ought to. I never used to dream or plan. I have begun to
  now. I do not want to spoil a new life at the very beginning' I need someone
  to guard me and restrain me. I must have a friend. I can live and keep
  silence if you are there...I know it by your coming this morning. I felt like
  screaming it to Sophy. I want to rush out and seize the first person by the
  shoulder and point...It comes to me like that. I see him, his face
  covered...,'</p>

  <p>He felt the shudder passing through her. She was silent a moment or two.
  'But I can be quiet if you are there,' she said, rising...' It is very simple
  not to spoil your life or my own for a nightmare. We were drawn to one
  another from the first. You understand me; you're different. I...like
  you.'</p>

  <p>He rose too. 'I understand,' he said. She looked at him, standing close,
  her head thrown back, the violet line of her eyes showing under the half-shut
  lids. He saw her for what she was, soulless&mdash;his breed in that-the
  creature of her instincts, nothing an offence that her desire showed her.
  Gisberne had known as little of the irony of fate as he had known of the fact
  that he was man. He could have laughed at it now, did laugh in his heart,
  even a little with his lips. Here was safety at the price of all he wanted
  safety for.</p>

  <p>Irene leaned towards him. 'Be kind,' she murmured. 'I am wicked...weak. It
  is awful to tolerate you. But I say that with my lips. In my heart I only
  feel...I...'</p>

  <p>'I know,' said Gisberne gently; 'I know.' He put his arms about her
  shoulder and kissed her.</p>

  <p>She seemed to weigh his kiss, standing motionless with closing eyes.</p>

  <p>'Leave your plans alone a little while,' said Gisberne, after a movement
  he knew she could not see. 'I'll come to you again.' At his pleasant voice,
  the sound of his turning to go, she made a sudden passionate movement between
  abandonment and despair.</p>

  <p>'Do you mind?' she cried. 'Is it not better than betraying&mdash;us both?
  You must be the last, the very last, to judge me...Tell me what to do. Be
  there, be kind, and I will be true till death.'</p>

  <p>For answer again he kissed her.</p>

  <p>Gisberne went back to his room in the inn and sat down. It was a very
  simply furnished place, showing lavishly a hard-handed cleanliness. The bed
  and chest of drawers, the chairs and tables, uncompromising articles of usage
  and necessity, seemed, as he looked round, strange and, somehow, useless.
  Seated among them, he debated with himself whether he should take Irene Garth
  away. He debated which was more to him&mdash;the making Daphne Estorel his,
  with almost immediate discovery to follow, or the keeping from her for ever
  the knowledge of what he was.</p>

  <p>Did he take Irene away. Daphne Estorel's opinion of him could scarcely
  alter, for supposing Paul should make clear to her <i>he</i> was not the
  murderer, nothing could ever prove to her Irene Garth was not, for that <i>no
  one</i> knew save Irene and himself.</p>

  <p>Which should he do&mdash;save himself in her thoughts, waiting upon the
  long chances of the damned years, or hold her to his heart and to his lips
  and die&mdash;before she knew?</p>

  <p class="first">To whichever course Gisberne might, or had, in his heart
committed
  himself, money was needed&mdash;the one thing ending with life he should not
  miss! He had always needed money, he had coveted the high road instead of the
  gutter, and lacked money for it till he stole it. He had coveted the society
  of better men, and the lack of money taught him card-sharping. He coveted a
  few more days on earth near a woman, with the fair show that alone could take
  him into her presence, and the lack of money was a devil plucking at his
  elbow for the last attention.</p>

  <p>Gisberne was a seasoned gambler, but he was playing with dizzy stakes,
  time and chance against him. With something of a shock he learnt that Mrs.
  Ibimay had returned to Fulbec. Here was more matter for adjustment, and he
  was faint and sick with passion repressed on the edge of escape, and counting
  his days to a climax that would be death actually or effectually.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Ibimay sent a message asking him to come to her. As he went along the
  road, Gisberne laughed aloud to find himself in such request. Everyone glad
  to see him! Everyone requiring him. His brain had quickened. All the sardonic
  humour and irony and bliss and tragedy of things were to be crowded before
  his notice in one experience.</p>

  <p>Dora, at a glance unchanged save that her pallor was enhanced to
  ghastliness by her black, met him with remembrance at once conveyed of their
  last encounter.</p>

  <p>'So you are still here,' she said. 'You remember, Mr. Gisberne, what I
  said to you the day my husband died...I feel the same about it...To my own
  soul I hold myself to blame for Mr. Ferriby's death...I was almost the last
  to speak to him. I had a strong warning of disaster, and&mdash;let it go...'
  She paused here, a silence he did not break. 'There was foul play,' she went
  on; 'and I cannot rest...But if I could find out privately...I don't want the
  help of the law or the law's vengeance...I should like to know how he died. I
  should like to be face to face with the one who did it&mdash;and certain of
  it, and how and why.'</p>

  <p>Her eyes rested on him, dark and intense enough, it seemed, to read a
  man's soul. Yet Gisberne could sit behind his own steady gaze in security.
  The only thing stranger than our power with one another is our limit.</p>

  <p>'You want me to play the spy at the Grange,' he said, not without
  agitation. 'You think I am the sort of man for that sort of thing.'</p>

  <p>'I find you easy to confide in,' said Dora. 'I do not want to raise a hue
  and cry. But I cannot rest. I must speak about it to someone. I do not want
  you to do anything. I want you to let me talk to you about what I do...what I
  discover...I think Irene Garth knows something...I want to question her...And
  I must...I will!...' Her previous thought had been directed full against
  Paul. He wondered what had changed it.</p>

  <p>'But what can I do in that?' said Gisberne, almost too quietly.</p>

  <p>'I don't know...But I want someone at hand to talk to about that
  night.'</p>

  <p>And he noticed with his new powers of observation the thinness of her
  hands, her hollowed cheeks, the spark of fever in her eyes and burning in her
  lips. She mourned for Devil Ferriby, and he was there as if sent by Heaven to
  give her the ease of speech.</p>

  <p>It was the very irony indeed of vengeance, a judgment warrant in the hands
  of gentleness itself.</p>

  <p>'I don't want to distress Miss Estorel,' said Dora, 'and Paul Ferriby is a
  Ferriby. Is there any attachment there&mdash;do you know?&mdash;between
  Daphne and Paul?'</p>

  <p>Gisberne rose. 'I do not know,' he said. 'The whisper is, whatever Mr.
  Paul may have done, it was on account of Miss Garth.'</p>

  <p>'I must find out what happened.' She did not speak in the agitation of any
  new resolve, but with the calm of one who has decided on the way to support
  existence. 'If I can do it by myself with your help&mdash;' She broke off,
  moving towards her writing-table. 'I say again, What is public vengeance to
  me?...only it must be that rather than nothing. I <i>will</i> know. I will
  keep his name alive, and use it and hear it at any cost.'</p>

  <p>The words dropped as with the dead weight of bullets. Her back was to him,
  and she stood a moment as still as if listening to their fall; then sat down,
  her back turned as before, and began to gather something together, opening a
  drawer and rustling papers.</p>

  <p>Gisberne knew what she was about. She was going to offer him money. She
  knew him for a cheat and a card-sharper. She had seen Ferriby's eyes strike
  him with contempt out of the consideration of decent folk. She was going to
  offer him money to spy.</p>

  <p>He remained where he had risen, waiting. He was not aware he looked at
  her; but, inwardly or outwardly, he followed the movement of her hands with
  exact appreciation.</p>

  <p>When in a moment or two she rose and came back to him, the envelope she
  had filled and sealed between her fingers, there was that in his face that
  startled her into a moment's pause. He lifted his eyes, and Dora Ibimay
  thought of a dog crouched for the blow.</p>

  <p>She hesitated. 'I was going to ask you to take this,' she said, 'because
  it is plain if you remain in Droitlet...I assure you it is with no reference
  to...' She stopped. 'That was my husband's affair. I must have someone's
  help...Why should I not employ yours?'</p>

  <p>He remained silent.</p>

  <p>'If I speak to anyone else there is no redress,' said Dora. 'I am not
  seeking a police affair, but I <i>will</i> find out.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Gisberne; 'I quite understand.'</p>

  <p>She offered the envelope gently. Gisberne took it, pale, but steady.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">About five o'clock a couple of days later he was on the
road towards the
  Grange. The seasons made little difference to the lean bare moorland. Soft
  white clouds floated low under a hazy sky, and the berries showed in the
  browning hedgerows.</p>

  <p>Gisberne rode leisurely, aware with a piteous satisfaction that both
  himself and his mount were perfectly groomed. He turned into the lane, and as
  he passed under the elms the light wind shook down a shower of yellow leaves.
  Beckoning to a boy gaping from the yard, he gave up his horse, and knowing
  that would be sufficient announcement, stepped through the gate and waited by
  the porch door. It was open. His eyes rested quietly on the row of
  garment-hung pegs, on the shut door beyond them.</p>

  <p>Miss Estorel was at home. He was taken to her in the room of the spinet, a
  dark-toned intimate room that shut one in privately.</p>

  <p>Daphne received him with smiles, with a pleading attempt at natural
  brightness of manner. She was in her riding-habit.</p>

  <p>'I was taking tea before I changed,' she said. 'You must join me and
  excuse me afterwards a moment.'</p>

  <p>'You are going back to riding,' said Gisberne.</p>

  <p>'Going back or beginning again with everything,' she answered, and her
  eyes smiled at him wistfully over her teacup.</p>

  <p>When he was alone, Gisberne sat down and braced himself. He knew, and she
  knew, he was looked upon as her suitor; the understanding between them was an
  understanding, and looked like one. And she knew, and everyone knew, that
  Robert Gisberne was of neither origin nor pretensions, a nobody from nowhere,
  and without money or land or a home. He himself might know why she let this
  make no difference, but others could not, and this must be plain to her, yet
  she welcomed him openly and retained his privileges. To-day there was a hint
  in her manner of recklessness, of reaction, of having borne enough and
  touched a limit. It was a moment of rebound&mdash;his chance,
  emphatically.</p>

  <p>When Daphne returned, the habit exchanged for a long gown's softnesses and
  undulations, she saw Gisberne seated by the window, his elbows resting on his
  knees, his forehead bowed on his hands. His smooth head was a silhouette
  against the dusk. Given instant pause, she stood startled, eyeing him
  askance; he did not move. She noticed his hands, the lithe, slim form How
  well he was dressed! The whole man appealed to her strongly.</p>

  <p>She remained, her heart beating fast, half afraid to look, still glancing
  askance, remembering every item of that night, every word and detail
  since.</p>

  <p>The moment between them she had known must come, but far off, like death
  or heaven, was all at once <i>here</i>. He cared for her. If it had not been
  for Paul...but was Paul still between them?</p>

  <p>'I beg your pardon,' said Gisberne heavily, lifting his head. He did not
  look at her or say more. Now, should she leave him? She found herself going
  towards him slowly. Her liking and comprehension overflowed. He uttered an
  uncontrollable sound&mdash;a word, her name&mdash;and making an as
  uncontrollable a movement towards her, still not looking up, her hands met
  his, and as they clasped he bowed his head forward and rested it against her,
  dumb and helpless.</p>

  <p>She did not move, nor by a quiver repel him; she had no wish to. With her
  one-time silence had gone Daphne Estorel's one-time defences, leaving her
  bare to every emotion&mdash;a tender, passionate creature, who saw her pure
  ideals, her spotless romance laid in the dust for the desires of Irene Garth
  to read. She had done a wild and mad thing for Paul Ferriby's sake, something
  so tremendous that in the pitch-dark when it rained she looked back
  disbelieving it. Vain and useless it appeared to her now, a degradation and a
  torture. Did this man care like this? Her breast heaved with sympathy. The
  impulse of recklessness was strong to defy herself and destiny, to snap her
  fingers at love, to let herself go to comfort Gisberne.</p>

  <p>She had lied for Paul Ferriby. She had striven for him with her soul, had
  put herself under an eternal obligation, and the man who had been a priceless
  friend suffered. A fierceness shook her. She would spurn not only Paul, but
  also her love for him; she would glory in defaming it, for, although loving
  him, she would drive him and Irene Garth hence together, and, since this man
  cared like this...</p>

  <p>She bent down to him. 'Are you thinking...' She broke off. 'Oh, what is
  it?...'</p>

  <p>He made an effort with himself, rose, avoiding her look,</p>

  <p>'I beg your pardon,' he repeated with difficulty, and moved away. 'I
  wanted to tell you...' he said, 'I am going to take Irene Garth away.'</p>

  <p>'You&mdash;you are going to...Irene Garth...' Her tone utterly
  incredulous, she followed him to see his face.</p>

  <p>'Yes; she is not to be trusted...If she remain here there will be a
  catastrophe...I think I can control&mdash;manage her...'</p>

  <p>'She has told you so. She <i>asks</i> you to take her away.'</p>

  <p>He was silent. She watched him. 'If it was not serious, I would not speak
  of it,' he said. 'She has hysteria. At any moment she may blurt it out.'</p>

  <p>'Blurt out what?' There was a long pause. She came nearer, repeating it
  gently. 'Blurt out what?'</p>

  <p>'She saw Mr. Paul.'</p>

  <p>The paleness as of that night itself overspread Daphne's face. She put her
  hand on Gisberne's arm.</p>

  <p>'She told you so?'</p>

  <p>Gisberne was well-nigh as pale as she was. His breath came hard. 'Not in
  so many words. There was no need.'</p>

  <p>'She saw us then, too?'</p>

  <p>'No, no! she went upstairs. I fancy she may have had a slight seizure of
  terror. There was some paroxysm that left nothing else clear.' He glanced
  round an instant into Daphne's face. 'We <i>know</i> she did not see
  <i>us</i>.'</p>

  <p>'She was with Mr. Ferriby, I suppose. He, Paul, found them together.'</p>

  <p>'Something of that sort, Miss Daphne.'</p>

  <p>'He did it in madness for her! It is as I said.'</p>

  <p>'What we always said,' answered Gisberne. 'His only excuse! His only
  chance of making it manslaughter. He did it for her.'</p>

  <p>Daphne stood back from him, her face transformed.</p>

  <p>'Then give him his reward,' she cried, striking her breast; '<i>let</i>
  her tell!'</p>

  <p>'And you and me?' asked Gisberne hoarsely.</p>

  <p>She was ready with her answer, fierce and undaunted. 'I have lies and
  horrors on my soul already,' she said. 'For what? For nothing! For Irene
  Garth.' She caught Gisberne by the shoulder, forcing him to look round at
  her. 'If there must be <i>more</i> lies,' she said, 'why should ours <i>this
  time</i> not be to save each other?'</p>

  <p>She saw the drops had started round his hair and under his eyes. In a
  moment she was all softness and woe again, in a transport of sympathy. She
  clung to him.</p>

  <p>'I will not have you suffer,' she said. '...Let her tell, let happen what
  will...Can you and I not lie again, if need be, to save each other? If
  <i>I</i> am ready...'</p>

  <p>He grasped her by the shoulders, as if with anger, his face contorted.</p>

  <p>'Why,' he said, scarcely articulate, 'do you know what you are doing? You
  are making it impossible for me&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Impossible for you to go!' she cried, beside herself. 'I mean
  to...Impossible for you to go away with her.'</p>

  <p>Each looked into the other's white strained face.</p>

  <p>'Death!' thought Gisberne. 'I will die.' He would know her lips had been
  to his, her heart against his heart. He would know it was so by her own will
  and gift. Ah! but he would know, too, she would never purge herself in her
  own sight of the stain. He would know, too, that she would shudder aghast at
  his memory.</p>

  <p>She breathed his name, telling him she could not bear it&mdash;telling him
  he was dear to her; her friend and consoler.</p>

  <p>He found himself saying something with his lips voicelessly...She pressed
  nearer. He prayed in his soul. Had he a soul, then, in which to pray? He put
  her back. He would forgo her&mdash;take Irene Garth away. He would be the
  jailer of the truth as long as both should live. And his reward should be
  that this woman should never know&mdash;for her own sake should never
  know.</p>

  <p>Distracted by his dumb struggle, she laid her arms about him.</p>

  <p>'What can I do?' she said. 'It breaks my heart.'</p>

  <p>'What would it matter to me when dead?' thought Gisberne. He put his hand
  across his eyes to clear away the dark into which he seemed plunging. Her
  face was almost touching his.</p>

  <p>'Is it possible that you could care?' he gasped.</p>

  <p>She fell back, a little touched with fear; but her woman's heart torn for
  him, her spirit reckless and defiant of cross-purposes and tricks of
  fate...</p>

  <p>'I could...I can,' she said. 'Oh, do not care so much...'</p>

  <p>Dusk had passed into dark, but the room was lit by the blazing logs. A
  servant entered and stopped short instantly, aware of a mistake and an
  intrusion.</p>

  <p>'I beg your pardon, miss; I thought that you had rung for candles.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Daphne. She scarcely moved. Gisberne, stepping from her
  instinctively, concealed his face. 'I want nothing,' said Daphne. The softly
  closing door was both comprehension and apology; there was an assurance in it
  they would not be disturbed again. It was the last smoothing of the way. Did
  not Gisberne know she could have hailed the interruption and forced the
  moment aside; she had, instead, refused, and sanctioned the only reading
  possible of an interview alone in agitation with someone known as a
  wooer.</p>

  <p>'I am sorry,' he said unsteadily; 'I did not mean this to happen.' His
  movement seemed to say that in a moment he would go, his hesitation that he
  begged a moment for recovery, the chance for her sake to control himself
  before he left her door.</p>

  <p>Daphne sat down. It was strange to her, even then, how in every little
  thing this man did he pleased her. One of the logs, piled too high, fell with
  a crash on the hearth and sent up a shower of sparks, and white-hot splinters
  flew, one near the folds of her gown. It fascinated her to see him come on
  the instant and set it right, with quiet deftness and quick arrangement, he
  with his ghastly face and tightened lips, his laboured self-control held
  in.</p>

  <p>After a while that seemed long to her, he returned to his accustomed seat.
  He had fought himself into calm.</p>

  <p>'I shall be very careful with my arrangements,' he said. 'I think of going
  to-morrow or so. As it stands now, Miss Garth will follow...I have been
  visiting here...Your servant just now...I shall avoid the barest suggestion
  of disrespect...'</p>

  <p>For a while Daphne could not speak.</p>

  <p>'You really mean to go?' Her voice was cold.</p>

  <p>'It seems to me the only thing.'</p>

  <p>She was silent; her blood chilled.</p>

  <p>'Do you mean that you will marry Irene Garth?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'That is as may befall. I do not think so. I shall watch her; keep her
  silent.'</p>

  <p>For the first time Daphne did not believe in him.</p>

  <p>'You will go after I have asked you to stay?' she said softly.</p>

  <p>'I cannot stay near you.'</p>

  <p>'If I want you to...if I say so?'</p>

  <p>'There is Paul Ferriby.'</p>

  <p>'He can never be anything to me.'</p>

  <p>He looked up; their eyes met. He half rose, caught himself back...' You
  knew, of course, it must happen,' he said hurriedly&mdash;' with me, I mean.
  Or, no, I don't see why. But there it is. I can't put it into words: what
  another man might say won't pass my lips. I'm the dust under your feet; I'm
  less than that...'</p>

  <p>'You are someone at whose mercy I stand,' she interrupted. 'You have been
  splendid! Do you think my life could balance what you did that night?'</p>

  <p>'And what was it for?' Gisberne began in answer. He paused, a feeling took
  him that he could not go on, only, through the awful lie of it, as awful a
  truth dragged at him, pulling him through the suffocation of hell. 'I helped
  you that night,' he said, 'because you couldn't bear the thought of penal
  servitude or hanging for Paul Ferriby. Well, you couldn't bear it now.' He
  rose, gripping his chair, his bearing fine. 'Suppose I took you at your
  word&mdash;the kindness of your heart, dared to touch your hand&mdash;'</p>

  <p>She rose and held it out to him impetuously, kindling.</p>

  <p>He took it and laid it on his heart. 'Yours would beat like that,' he
  said&mdash;he was as someone suffocating-'if anything threatened Mr. Paul.
  Oh, it's not gone off into air. Miss Daphne; it might happen any moment. If I
  took you at your word, if I stayed on here it <i>would</i>...I must see it
  doesn't&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'But <i>you care</i> for me?' she whispered, lifted out of herself,
  incredulous.</p>

  <p>'God!'&mdash;it was a prayer, an invocation from man's knowledge to the
  unknown, from human limit to the limitless beyond&mdash;' I love you,' he
  said, and then stood before her, bowed and abased, as though he had dealt her
  a blow.</p>

  <p>She wondered at him. Her hand had fallen from him. 'Oh! who am I?' she
  breathed. 'What did I do&mdash;I, who could care for a coward and a
  murderer?'</p>

  <p>He looked at her swiftly. 'In your heart you know him neither!' he cried.
  It was a confession, and broke from him before he knew. Transported, he held
  to it, repeated it. 'You know him neither,' he said.</p>

  <p>But her eyes shone at him. 'You are generous,' she cried. 'Oh! leave those
  two alone. We will take thought for ourselves.'</p>

  <p>'No!' He made a great effort, and a ghost of his pleasant smile touched
  eyes and lips. 'See, Miss Daphne, it's like this. You've got your life before
  you. I'm going to clear out of your way the one thing you can't manage. It's
  drawing the sting out of that night's business to keep Miss Garth quiet.
  True, there's Mrs. Ibimay and Mr. Paul himself; but talk 'll go a long way
  without harm. He's denied it once; he can again. There's no proof without
  Miss Garth, and that proof <i>I'll</i> answer for. You may think you don't
  care. You do. Figure it out to the bitter end, just as you did that night.
  You'd die of it. That's a way of talking...You know...what it would be.'</p>

  <p>She stared at him incredulous, baffled at a struggle beyond her
  powers.</p>

  <p>'But if <i>I</i> know...what then of you?...' she asked with awe.</p>

  <p>'Miss Daphne, it's the only thing I can do...' He turned from her, looking
  round blindly for his things.</p>

  <p>She moved to the door, and was there when he came to it. She looked at him
  with that glow he had already seen in her&mdash;that rare expansion like the
  outward spring of the soul.</p>

  <p>'This is all my fault,' she said, 'that you suffer for my wild madness. I
  can't believe in your plan. It seems beyond belief&mdash;that you should be
  ready to do that...But I won't have security at such a price! Do you want me
  to disdain Paul Ferriby more than I do? <i>He</i> shall take Irene Garth
  away, and you shall stay with me here, the master of this house&mdash;my
  hus&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He stopped the word on her lips with a cry. He caught her from the door,
  and into his arms, holding her close. And yet&mdash;she remembered it to him
  in the time to come&mdash;and yet&mdash;with a difference.</p>

  <p>'If I didn't love you,' he said in a madness of emotion&mdash;' if I
  didn't love you! But I do; I know it from top to bottom, from first to last,
  and it's true every syllable ever said or dreamed of it. Oh, you sweetest of
  women...you didn't say it I It was nothing! Your kindness, just kindness and
  pity...Look here, I haven't even kissed your hand...I'm going to live to
  straighten things...to serve you...to save you from ever...from ever...Oh,
  sweetest woman, sweetest woman!...'</p>

  <p>A few moments later Daphne, gathering herself together, ran stealthily,
  glancing right and left, to the hall-door that had just closed. She opened
  it, and saw a figure moving through the clear dark towards the gate. She did
  not move or call. She stood in the gleam of the lamp; did he turn, he must
  see. But the light footsteps went on, the iron gates clanged softly. Daphne
  stood gazing into empty space. He had gone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-14"
     id="ch-2-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">Paul Ferriby stood waiting in the living-room of the
Grange. The season
  had come round to spring. Changing seasons made little difference to the dark
  tones of the rooms of Ferriby, with the flames of the burning wood seldom
  absent leaping or latent on the great hearths. The sun was creeping a little
  nearer to its summer blaze across the wide casement. For the rest, no
  change&mdash;and what change should there be in Ferriby? Paul had changed: as
  little like the boy who had received the whip-lash as the young man who had
  slouched against yonder casement, the sullen slave of untutored blood and
  proffered beauty. His dark face suited the room; he looked at home. All
  around him was an aid to his force and strength. No aloofness about him, no
  soulless detachment. He took in with his eyes, he breathed in and gave back
  every item, in work or conquest, in having or holding, that has passed
  through the hands of a man or has ever gone to his making.</p>

  <p>The room was in perfect order, and seemed to have been treated with some
  little ceremony of expectation. On the table where the supper had been spread
  that night stood a huge green bowl, a thing of French manufacture, holding
  king-cups and water-flags. A Persian rug was laid along the dais; a scarf
  that might have come from Algiers was thrown over a chair; books strewed the
  wide window-sill between strange old pots of bizarre shapes.</p>

  <p>Daphne Estorel had been away. She had been South and out of England
  awhile. It was said she had followed Robert Gisberne. That was nonsense.</p>

  <p>It was said she meant to desert Ferriby altogether because of Devil
  Ferriby's Hush! said the gossips; but, said they, there was foul play, only
  keep the whisper below the breath. Paul Ferriby and Lawyer Winch had things
  between themselves, and never were the revenues more prosperous or the lands
  better farmed. Jane Skidfell brooded in her room. There went a tale among the
  women that Miss Estorel had always cared for Mr. Paul; it came in some
  fashion from Sophy Bassett, who had also gone South with Miss Irene, for that
  winter Solomon Scarside did a strange thing. He went to a night-school to
  acquire the art of reading strange and heathenish characters, and he had
  letters from London, and thus wrestled with them alone, saying naught. Yet
  from him or elsewhere that much had leaked out. For the rest, loneliness
  settled upon Ferriby. Paul had ridden alone day after day, under the sad
  winter sky, among the brown fields. He kept his thoughts to himself, and men
  meeting him kept theirs.</p>

  <p>Yesterday in the spring-tide Daphne had returned; to-day, early; Paul was
  here to see her.</p>

  <p>He paced the room in slow and thoughtful fashion. He was gaitered,
  well-dressed, and carried his riding-whip lightly in a strong, brown
  gentleman's hand.</p>

  <p>The door from the kitchen opened upon Daphne in a rich gown of black and
  white, her hair done marvellously, gold upon her fingers and about her
  wrists, some white and yellow flowers at her breast.</p>

  <p>Without speaking, she turned and let the latch down noiselessly; then,
  facing round, stayed there. He, arrested in his walk, halted by the
  bureau...</p>

  <p>Without wonder, with an unutterable tranced relief, they knew joy in
  seeing each other there, looking cautiously at first as those who after long
  thirst fear to trust themselves to drink. They saw each other, and <i>he</i>
  knew what the missing her had been. She knew he was there, and she was glad.
  Not through anyone else's eyes, but through her own, Daphne Estorel had seen
  what makes a world. Behind her it fell away into nothingness, a tale of
  shadows. She moved forward as on air.</p>

  <p>'Paul!'</p>

  <p>'You are back,' he said. A deep breath was drawn; his chest rose and fell;
  her bosom heaved, and it seemed one sigh. She stole to the fire and sat down.
  Their eyes were still on each other's.</p>

  <p>'You are back,' he said again. Suddenly he laid his whip down gently and
  came to her side and took her hands. They leapt to his as the magnet to the
  steel. He smiled down into her face, upturned and smiling into his.</p>

  <p>'You are back.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, and you are here.' Her smile broke into a little tremulous
  laugh.</p>

  <p>Then the glory was gone, and they were like two people under a black
  heaven, broken for a moment, staring round for the vanished gleam.</p>

  <p>'You wanted to see me,' said Daphne with an air of embarrassment. 'Will
  you not sit down?'</p>

  <p>'No, thank you; I must ride on immediately.' He walked back to his whip
  and hat. 'Miss Estorel, I have unpleasant news. Has any of it reached you
  yet?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'You have not seen or heard anything of Mrs. Ibimay?'</p>

  <p>'No.' Instant pallor had changed her face like a mask.</p>

  <p>'She returned to Fulbec yesterday morning. She has with her Irene
  Garth...'</p>

  <p>Daphne rose.</p>

  <p>'I don't want to startle you,' said Paul; 'perhaps I shall <i>not</i>
  startle you. I hear it said that Mrs. Ibimay proposes to take out a warrant
  against me for the murder of Devil Ferriby, on the strength of Irene Garth's
  accusation. She has confessed she saw me kill him.'</p>

  <p>Had the whole world been struck from her feet and she left with some
  supernatural foothold gazing into the blank, Daphne would have felt the same
  shock. Now she knew how all this while she had trusted Gisberne. Now that he
  had failed, she knew her world&mdash;the world that held Paul
  Ferriby&mdash;had been borne on his shoulders.</p>

  <p>'Confessed!' she echoed stupidly. 'Confessed!'</p>

  <p>Paul looked at her, reading her expression like a man incredulous. 'Did
  <i>you</i> see me do it?' he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>She drew from her dress a packet kept, it would seem, hidden next her
  heart, and with a look not to be rendered in words held it out to him on her
  palm. It was wrapped in a flimsy handkerchief warmed with her very body's
  warmth, fragrant of herself. He undid it, and laid bare his knife.</p>

  <p>From the knife he looked to her face, from her face to the knife. Once,
  twice, he seemed about to speak, and changed his mind.</p>

  <p>'Did you get this from Irene Garth?' he asked.</p>

  <p>She pointed past him to the spot where Ferriby had lain.</p>

  <p>'I...found...it...by him.'</p>

  <p>His eyes followed her gesture; he stood confounded. She clutched the knife
  back against her heart and leant upon his arm.</p>

  <p>'You did not <i>know</i> you had killed him, did you?' she said. 'You
  thought it was an accident?'</p>

  <p>He gazed on her lost and wondering, yet half grasping it, half putting it
  together.</p>

  <p>'I thought,' he began slowly, and then, breaking off, turned and looked
  towards the door into the entry. It opened with a jerk, and showed at once
  the face and figure of a man&mdash;Robert Gisberne.</p>

  <p>He was pale from a night's sleeplessness, and spent a little from hard
  riding, and splashed with mud. Daphne loosed her hold of Paul and ran to him
  with a heartfelt cry.</p>

  <p>'I knew it,' she said. 'I knew the moment I heard that it would bring you
  back.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-15"
     id="ch-2-15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">Gisberne had come for a last throw with fate. In every
calculation the
  incalculable must be allowed for. He, allowing for it, was here now, ready to
  meet it, desperately ready, knowing neither its form nor how it could be
  done. If credit may be given to the leader, never mind of what forlorn hope,
  then Gisberne might claim it. He had the knowledge a dog may have, and beyond
  that, for sole inspiration, hope and fear, God and salvation, the desire of
  his blood towards a woman, and the dread of damnation in knowing himself
  discovered to her. He was here to ward off damnation if he could.</p>

  <p>Paul Ferriby in himself was as nothing to Gisberne. His absorbing passion
  for and love of Daphne Estorel decreed that this darling, this one among
  women, would suffer more by knowledge of him revealed than by loss of Paul.
  Gisberne's love had risen high enough to put her from his arms. He had longed
  for her since with the dreariness of a slow and weary dying. He had been a
  coward, preferring a tenderness of remembrance to bliss, with death to
  follow, and her scorn to brand and sear him even in the burn of hell.</p>

  <p>But in the cursed need of money, he had failed in the alternative that he
  had chosen. If vengeance did wait to close with him some day, he knew its
  shape&mdash;the sordid, intolerable, wretched need for money. Through need of
  money he had let Irene Garth slip through his guard.</p>

  <p>Well, he had followed on her track recklessly, for once unkempt, his
  pockets empty, travelling hard to face&mdash;what he could not foresee.</p>

  <p>He had passed along, expecting arrest at every step. Then, like a man who
  leaps in the dark and rises from the fall of it to see the sun, he heard
  Daphne Estorel's greeting, beheld her coming to him, felt her outstretched
  hands...</p>

  <p>From that encounter, he lifted his eyes to Paul Ferriby's face...</p>

  <p>Paul stood by the bureau where Devil Ferriby had lain...</p>

  <p>His eyes, like enough to Devil Ferriby's eyes to serve, were fixed upon
  Gisberne with the same flash-light of inner recognition of him that had
  forced Gisberne to use murder to extinguish it. 'Thief!' Devil Ferriby had
  said that night, with his bloodshot eyes glaring through the candle flame as
  Gisberne turned a sharp face over his shoulder, his hand held out to the pile
  of gold, and saw that the stunned man was stunned no more, but coming on him.
  'Thief!' And Gisberne had murdered him.</p>

  <p>In the same fashion&mdash;'It was <i>you</i>,' cried Paul Ferriby's eyes
  now, and Gisberne narrowed his own and moved forward instinctively. Such an
  instant, a breath that allows of nothing either side save instinct, the
  instant when accusation flashes from the eyes to the lips, that is when a man
  accused strikes down in self-defence. The thing was too suddenly tense for
  speech, an onset to be met by onset, and Paul strode up to meet it. Nothing
  was clear, only the prompting of the blood in one man to denounce and avenge,
  in the other to hold what he had not yet lost.</p>

  <p>And Gisberne had always had his little bits of luck, if luck it could be
  called, that got him respite. Daphne Estorel had her hand on his
  arm&mdash;who could overlook beyond a breath the brightness of her presence?
  Paul kept the outbreak back.</p>

  <p>A little clock on the bureau-top had ticked away a minute. Neither of the
  three knew how that minute had been filled. They had moved in some automatic
  fashion. Paul glanced at the time.</p>

  <p>'I don't want to go without a word with Mr. Gisberne,' he said, 'since he
  is here. May I speak with him alone?'</p>

  <p>Daphne looked up instantly. 'No,' she said quickly; 'I must hear
  everything that passes.'</p>

  <p>Gisberne had made his way to a seat with something of a half apology, as
  if to excuse his need of it. His forehead was damp, and he smoothed it as if
  conscious of dishevelment. His breathing was not steady, nevertheless it was
  plain that it was from haste and physical exhaustion. He looked like someone
  who would see the game through.</p>

  <p>'Miss Daphne, wouldn't it be better?' he said.</p>

  <p>'No!' She rose suddenly, holding by the stately carved back of her chair.
  'No!'</p>

  <p>A woman! How the difference was marked! She wore flowers at her bosom, to
  come decked into the presence of tragic issues. She translated everything,
  deception, lies, dishonour, into the one thought 'love,' and its opposite,
  separation. She would be sublime, she would be ignoble, only knowing of the
  one guiding line through every stress and possessed always by her own beauty,
  her self, a complex thing for no one love, for all love, for pity and
  compassion, big as life and encompassing all possibilities&mdash;a woman! The
  men saw less, and saw more too&mdash;differently.</p>

  <p>Paul looked at her, hesitated, turned away. Instantly Gisberne rose with
  the uneasiness of a man fatigued, but moving quickly enough to get the
  custody of the door.</p>

  <p>'Look here, Mr. Paul,' he said, 'I don't know what you want to say to me,
  but I came up here post-haste to have a word with you before the mischief is
  irrevocable. <i>I</i> killed Mr. John Ferriby. Through me he fell down that
  clumsy trap and broke his neck. It wasn't exactly my fault, and there seemed
  no cause to speak of it; and there wouldn't have been save for Mrs. Ibimay.
  She is crazy, and she has affected Miss Garth. I may tell you Miss Garth
  cares enough for me to put herself in my hands as my future wife. She's not
  answerable for what she says. She wants to make out it was you. It seems you
  and Mr. Ferriby <i>did</i> meet that night and have words about her,
  and&mdash;well, I'm here to clear you. <i>I</i> had words with Mr. Ferriby
  too that night, and it was <i>my</i> little fracas killed him.'</p>

  <p>'You're lying,' said Paul.</p>

  <p>'I don't see why you say so,' answered Gisberne.</p>

  <p>The other's face darkened furiously and showed white under the tan.
  'You're lying,' he said again. He turned to Daphne. 'Is this your
  suggestion?' he cried to her.</p>

  <p>She lifted her face from her hands, where she had covered it while
  Gisberne spoke. She stepped forward, and her eyes blazed at him.</p>

  <p>'No! It is his own lie to save <i>you</i>, because he knows I care...even
  for a coward...'</p>

  <p>Strangely come love and death. Having spoken Daphne turned from both men,
  and seemed about to break from the room, or into some uttermost passion of
  tears and words. But she stayed herself by the door and leant against the
  wall with upthrown arms, her head bowed upon them.</p>

  <p>Neither of the men stirred. The fury died from Paul's face, his gaze bent
  upon the ground. His mind withdrew itself from time and place and the
  occasion. It was as if all the soft air and sunshine he had ever breathed,
  the loneliness of the big stretches, the sighing winds and stars for ever in
  their places, the daily going from morning to the evening with fierce pulses
  or with languid ones, all and everything that had made up life itself instead
  of the mere feeling of life, were now transmuted into that woman's shape
  leaning yonder in passionate abandon. Daphne Estorel had been silent as the
  days, bright as the encompassing sunshine, and ever there about his hours
  like the winds and stars, and he had breathed her in as unconsciously.</p>

  <p>But now in the garden of the soul he opened his eyes from a trance and saw
  the woman&mdash;sobbing, wild, weak, beautiful; fire and softness, folly and
  love; something sweet and conscienceless as the wild rose, yet pure enough to
  be a messenger from God; elusive as the light, and yet a warm, sobbing,
  piteous thing to take to his heart and soothe; someone to break his heart, to
  touch him into a madness and an ecstasy.</p>

  <p>'Because he knows I cared&mdash;and for a coward&mdash;' From the silent
  brightness, still-lipped and aloof, such sweetness and weakness to blossom
  forth. She cared, and caring, she had let this other lie him into the
  coward's place. So much was clear. What else? At last Paul lifted his gaze to
  Gisberne's face comprehendingly, questioningly.</p>

  <p>'Yes!' said Gisberne's look in answer, 'she stands to me for everything I
  know above the gutter and beyond damnation. I shall hold out to the end. Make
  the best of it you can.'</p>

  <p>Someone rapped lightly.</p>

  <p>'Mrs. Ibimay,' said Paul; and Daphne turned with a start. She dried her
  eyes and hurried to the door.</p>

  <p>Even as she did it the incongruity of these little details struck her; she
  could have wrung her hands and laughed and screamed to see Dora as she
  entered quickly close a parasol. Behind her was Irene Garth and, shrinking in
  fine black attire, with all her colour gone, Sophy Bassett.</p>

  <p>Irene started at the sight of Gisberne. She hurried to him, saying
  something, and slipped her hand within his arm.</p>

  <p>'They have been frightening you,' said Dora, taking Daphne's hand. 'I
  thought it might be so. My dear, I am not going to do anything. But I had to
  find out.' She looked round her. 'There are some things one cannot bear. Mr.
  Ferriby's death is on my soul. I could not let it rest. I <i>had</i> to know.
  She'&mdash;her eyes dwelt unlovingly upon Irene&mdash;'<i>had</i> to tell!'
  She turned to Paul. 'So it came to it in the end. You avenged yourself;
  <i>you</i> killed him.'</p>

  <p>With the advent of that white set face, the icy coldness of the voice, the
  room chilled and the brightness seemed drawn out of the sunshine as by
  ghostly fingers. One could fancy the blossoms in the great bowl grew pallid.
  A shudder touched Irene. Without moving, Gisberne's glance went down to her
  beside him. His hand moved cautiously. He had his revolver.</p>

  <p>Irene spoke hurriedly. 'It's over now. There is no use in talking about
  it. It was my fault.' She looked at Dora. 'You said you were coming to
  arrange how best to hush it up.'</p>

  <p>'To hush it up&mdash;the murder that I did.' It was Paul's voice ringing
  through the chilled atmosphere like a young god's. He bore down upon Irene,
  and she cowered, clutching Gisberne's arm. '<i>You saw</i> me kill him?' he
  cried, superb with scorn and a mad elation.</p>

  <p>White as snow, holding Gisberne close, she looked him in the eyes.&mdash;'
  Yes!'</p>

  <p>'Thank God! You end my cowardice. I've been a coward! Afraid to say I
  killed Devil Ferriby. I've been screening behind lies, sneaking safety! God!
  to think I <i>did</i> kill him, and that you saw it, and that I'm avenged.
  You would see it; you knew I should do it!' He laughed in her face.&mdash;'
  Have you got that paper? I wrote it with the blood that dripped from
  this'&mdash;he flung his hand up towards his face&mdash;' and his brand
  across my life and my soul!&mdash;I told you of that too! And that I'd met
  him that night. But to think you saw me kill him&mdash;you! It's some amends.
  Merciful God, it's some amends!'</p>

  <p>He turned from her; he had not touched her; it was just as if he flung her
  to the ground.</p>

  <p>'I've been mad,' he said, looking round with a laugh. 'I've been tearing
  my heart out thinking I did <i>not</i> kill Devil Ferriby, thinking I must
  stand to most folk, as I did in my own eyes, for a poltroon and a mockery!
  But that was my coward's madness. Thank God I did kill him! I claim it! On
  <i>her</i> word! She saw me! What better witness!'</p>

  <p>The burnished latch of the kitchen door lifted and fell behind Daphne, and
  the door opened and closed softly on Jane Skidfell. Daphne sank towards her
  sobbing and speechless, thrilled past belief or pain, or knowing what she
  felt.</p>

  <p>The old woman's eyes dimmed to whiteness went round the group and rested
  upon Paul.</p>

  <p>'So it was thee, ma lad,' she said. 'I be glad to think if t' master's son
  wor hurtled into t' grave it wor by one of his own blood.'</p>

  <p>'Hush!' said Irene suddenly, 'he is in the room. Take me away,' she said
  to Gisberne. 'Sophy, take me away!'</p>

  <p>The inevitable leaves no possibility of a mistake. Five minutes ago
  Gisberne stood beyond detection. Let him go on paying his own flesh and
  blood, and he would keep off a reckoning indefinitely. Five minutes ago by a
  stupendous <i>tour de force</i> he had set himself high almost as Daphne's
  heart.</p>

  <p>But in arranging safety he had overreached it. Irene was the clay that
  slips slack from fingering to fingering. Gisberne's dog-like patient
  watchfulness and steady simple kindness, dedicated solely to keeping
  knowledge of him from Daphne Estorel, though it cost him unendingly the sight
  of her, were the strands of the rope he was to hang by. For Irene cared for
  him. She would lie Paul to destruction. She did not fear he would be hurt.
  But if she betrayed Gisberne&mdash;it was death. The madness to betray him,
  the awful impetus to speak, clutched her by so much the more.</p>

  <p>She loosed her hold on Gisberne's arm and stepped away from him, and he
  knew it was the inevitable. It touched him that he might kill her before the
  words were out&mdash;an idle notion. She would shout them after she was
  dead!</p>

  <p>'Stop me!' Irene cried out sharply, falling back against the table; and
  Sophy Bassett clasped her, white and frozen with fear.</p>

  <p>'Oh, Miss 'Rene dear! Don't, now don't!'</p>

  <p>Gisberne looked suddenly towards Daphne. 'I will take Miss Garth away,' he
  said; and Daphne gazed back mutely into his livid face. Gisberne could not
  tell what she divined. Her eyes met his in a dumb stare.</p>

  <p>'We will go,' he said blindly.</p>

  <p>Jane Skidfell crossed the room to the entry door.</p>

  <p>'Thee doest not go,' she said. 'What has come to t' lass?'</p>

  <p>Gisberne steadied himself. Even now it might avail to go on, to keep his
  place, to set down his stake once more.</p>

  <p>In a dead stillness, Death and Damnation partners against him, Gisberne
  put down his last card.</p>

  <p>'Irene,' he said very gently, 'tell them all you know.'</p>

  <p>She gave him a wide look. 'Of course. Who is asking about it? Hasn't Paul
  <i>said</i> he killed him?...' She turned and looked down on the floor. 'It
  was here,' she said. Dora Ibimay uttered a cry. 'Why, is anyone saying Mr.
  Gisberne had anything to do with it?' said Irene. Then her voice changed, and
  she staggered, choking, with the attack rising in great sobs in her throat.
  She fell to her knees, calling on someone to stop her.</p>

  <p>'She is mad,' said Gisberne. 'Miss Estorel, I warned you.'</p>

  <p>And at something in Daphne's face Paul caught Irene up and looked into her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>'Be still,' he said, in frenzied passionate entreaty. 'Haven't I claimed I
  did it?'</p>

  <p>'But <i>you did not</i>...Ah, I warned you!' There broke from her the loud
  frightened cry of hysteria. She pointed frantically across the room, and Dora
  Ibimay, infected, rose with outstretched hands, whispering and sobbing across
  dry lips: 'John...John!...'</p>

  <p>Irene cowered, covering her ears. 'Don't listen to him!' she
  shrieked.&mdash;' He's shouting out who murdered him. He <i>knows I
  saw</i>!'</p>

  <p>She screamed, and tried to hide from the vision of pursuing eyes.&mdash;'
  Don't touch me. Cousin John...I will tell them! I will!...I will!'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-16"
     id="ch-2-16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p class="first">It seemed to Robert Gisberne waiting for it that the dark
of that spring
  day would never come. He sat in a room of the Droitlet Inn staring into the
  west, and saw, as far as he could recall, for the first time in his life, the
  changing hues of sunset&mdash;<i>saw</i> them. In the room where he sat he
  had been for hours, waiting at first for some communication from Ferriby to
  follow him. When Irene Garth had said her say he had left the house, mounted,
  and ridden away unhindered and unmolested.</p>

  <p>Irene Garth had been very circumstantial, very deliberate. Gisberne did
  not waste a thought on questioning the absolute conviction with which
  everybody had heard her describe the wet cloth, and she had spoken of the
  blue wrap and the broken amber beads. The game was over. Death and Damnation
  had won the odd trick; but this being so, the fact that Daphne Estorel knew
  became as nothing, dwarfed by the realization of eternal separation from
  her.</p>

  <p>Death is an idle word; but death itself waiting at the end of an hour for
  a man in his full vigour with everything to lose by it, nothing to gain, is a
  big thing.</p>

  <p>Gisberne remained alone in the inn writing. No change became apparent in
  the demeanour of the innkeeper or of those who waited on him. Was he being
  given time in which to get away? They meant to keep the story quiet; they
  wanted to keep it quiet. What had Jane Skidfell said about one of Devil
  Ferriby's own blood?</p>

  <p>Gisberne winced. 'But they can't,' he said to himself. 'I haven't the
  money to get out of England, and to shoot myself at any lesser distance won't
  save it. I wonder they don't think of that. It doesn't strike them that I
  have no money. It might occur to Mrs. Ibimay. She would not trust me.'</p>

  <p>The irony of life was still present to him, and from another point of
  view. Mrs. Ibimay had tracked him and Irene down because she was dying of a
  thwarted passion, and must speak of the man who was dead, drag him among
  living folk again, turn his name on her tongue, make others talk of him, tear
  from Irene Garth mention of his every touch and caress that she might
  lacerate her own agony till it swooned and gave her ease. Would she think to
  bring Robert Gisberne fifty pounds that he might shoot himself beyond the
  reach of Ferriby or Daphne Estorel's association with it? And yet it would
  have been in passion's cause. For an hour he burned with fever for money to
  get away for her sake, that she should not loathe herself too much, her name
  coupled with a suicide, a pauper, a thief and murderer. Then came the
  shuddering fit, when the sweat broke on him at every footfall. To take money
  now! Who would believe he did not take it basely? But he was let alone.</p>

  <p>He arranged with himself that when it was dark he would walk to Ferriby,
  find some means of entrusting to Sophy Bassett the papers he had written, and
  then turn aside and end it. He had not the money for a return ticket. The
  hire of the horse and his day's lodging at the inn must go unsettled.</p>

  <p>Rose changed into yellow in the sky. He watched the yellow merge into a
  cool and ineffable green, in which pink cloudlets swam as in a lake; violet
  followed, and then the dark, and through the inn window Gisberne saw the
  stars begin to come.</p>

  <p>Before the house closed for the night he went out. He made good the
  dishevelment of travel, but it irked him to know his linen was not fresh that
  day. All the ground he had gained was gone from under his feet. One step
  behind him the gutter and the jail. Before him&mdash;a stoppage. But he did
  not feel like death. He was too much alive; had waited too long. And what
  good was death? He was not sure&mdash;by any means sure&mdash;that it would
  be any service to him. He had no guarantee that he would not know things
  after death, and he did not feel at all assured that he could bear it.
  Overhead were the stars, thrice familiar. He trod the earth; the heart in his
  body was ready to go on beating against time for ever. He could <i>not</i>
  stop this rhythm of life and find himself in a place of neither stars nor
  foothold, nor with a beating heart in a thrilling body, but yet a something
  that languished and knew the fire of desire.</p>

  <p>All his life Gisberne had gone quietly. He had known no passions. The
  brute in him had slunk out of sight along the wall. He had never taken to
  himself the right of a man. The brute bristled in him now and came into the
  open throb of the blood. Love had made the poetry of the world read to him
  like ABC. Brutality gave him in a flash as wide a knowledge. Murder! Men had
  embraced women reeking with their fathers' and their brothers' blood. His
  poor snivelling crime! He laughed with relief to think he had not killed
  himself before inspired to amend it with one worthier.</p>

  <p>All along the road images of himself confronted him: the spot where he had
  encountered Mrs. Ibimay, the bend where he had waited for Daphne; he saw
  himself plain as a wraith, always quiet and cool, always controlled. And what
  had he achieved? What were nerve and coolness against the despicable hysteria
  of a wanton girl?</p>

  <p>A brute fury against his own self-containment grew in Gisberne's blood,
  and drove him on along the lonely road as one possessed. It had been so clear
  what to do. It was now no longer clear. He was too alive to die. No shot
  could tell on fire; his blood ran with flame.</p>

  <p>'Now, if I were to meet Mr. Paul Ferriby,' he thought as he turned into
  the lane, 'it would not be a bad beginning.'</p>

  <p>As he emerged from the blossoming elms he saw the light in Irene Garth's
  room. With no definite plan of action, but without hesitation, he went up to
  the door he had quitted a few hours since, he thought finally. He tried it
  gently; there was no resistance, and he passed through. From the living-room
  came a sudden gleam, broadening as the light within was lifted and carried
  nearer.</p>

  <p>Gisberne, stealthily as a panther, gained half-way down the entry and
  waited. The door opened wide on a woman's figure, not Daphne&mdash;Mrs.
  Ibimay. Her face was no longer so ghastly. His mind, centred brutally on the
  relief of violence, noticed that, and some curious detached perception
  conveyed that she did not recoil from him, that her eyes were softer, her
  voice less strained.</p>

  <p>He stared at her fiercely, while she held the light high, assuring herself
  of his identity.</p>

  <p>'It <i>is you</i>,' she said. 'I have been expecting you for hours. I was
  sure you would come back. I felt you must.' She looked at him closely. 'I am
  sorry,' she said; 'my distress goaded me. I did not sufficiently consider
  what I was doing in meddling with a creature like Irene Garth...Mr. Ferriby
  was going to ride over to you...I was sure you would come. Of course, she is
  mad, Mr. Gisberne. We know that...Did you think Miss Estorel believed
  her?'</p>

  <p>Gisberne, staring at her, laughed. He thought <i>he</i> was mad. He
  thought he must have put a bullet through himself unwittingly, and that this
  must be the beginning of the mockery of hell...Then his senses
  cleared...<i>She did not believe it</i>. Irene Garth was mad...The flame went
  out in his blood and a weakness seized him, a feeling of self-pity, of being
  very cruelly handled.</p>

  <p>'Come in,' said Mrs. Ibimay; and Gisberne followed her into the
  living-room like a man who has gone over the edge of destruction, but,
  clinging there, hears a voice above him, and for a moment lifts his eyes.</p>


  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">'She is the cause of his death herself,' said Mrs. Ibimay.
'Her madness
  fastens first on Paul and then on you. But that night's work will rest upon
  her head, and hers only...It will stop at that. <i>I</i> am satisfied, and no
  one else will ever meddle any more with the manner of Devil Ferriby's
  death&mdash;never openly.'</p>

  <p>She had seated herself by the bureau on which she had replaced the candle,
  lit as her listening ear caught the sound of Gisberne at the door. He was
  huddled together at the table, his arms thrown over it, his head upon his
  arms.</p>

  <p>Now it was plain that the softening of Mrs. Ibimay's face and voice was
  due to tears&mdash;wild tears, that had broken up the pitilessness of calm.
  She gazed on him distressed.</p>

  <p>'I am sorry,' she said softly. 'You were doing a fine thing in keeping
  Irene Garth away...I have been suffering so terribly, it blinded me to
  everything. But sitting here waiting...I have realized this is where you and
  Daphne found him...' She looked down to the ground at her feet. Her voice
  ceased. Overhead could be heard a hurried footstep in Irene Garth's room and
  the soft closing of a door. 'I think there is a hereafter,' said Dora again
  into the silence. 'I feel sure of it...Love and strength...if they survive,
  nothing else can, surely&mdash;not our offences, not our mistakes&mdash;so it
  does not so much matter. You understand me? She does <i>not believe Irene
  Garth</i>. She was coming to you herself, only...I...we...I thought you might
  impetuously say something rash. I have suffered anguish...anguish. I see more
  clearly now. I would not hurt anyone who suffers...who loves...who has shown
  strength.'</p>

  <p>Gisberne did not move. He had thought of everything in and out of
  damnation. He had not thought of this. Daphne Estorel refused to
  believe&mdash;could not, would not believe. He held his miserable confession
  between his fingers, and while he had been writing it she had been restrained
  from coming to him to tell him she did not believe.</p>

  <p>If Mrs. Ibimay and Paul Ferriby believed him Devil Ferriby's murderer,
  they would never say so. In Irene Garth's crazy utterances the truth of that
  night's work was buried as safely as in the tomb. On her head it would rest.
  She could tear her heart to tatters uttering the truth and avail nothing. He
  need not even guard her. He could go. The world was open to him. Death
  stepped out of the way of life, dismissed.</p>

  <p>But Gisberne did not move. Dora Ibimay came up once and laid her hand upon
  his shoulder. Did she think it remorse? Did she think it a wrestle with the
  agony of passion? She sighed, and after awhile went softly from the room.</p>

  <p>Could he go on with it? Gisberne asked himself. His thoughts went
  searching through the places he had known. They were like desolate spaces
  over which a cold wind blew ashes. Could he go on? Love and strength. He had
  love. Had he strength to go off and live his life out till the old lie was
  beaten out, separated to its atoms, no more even a lie?...Could he live away
  from her, poor, obscure, fighting for decency, all there was to sustain him
  the knowledge that she thought him honest, thought him kind, a priceless
  friend? Paul Ferriby was between them. In his embrace she would forget...He,
  poor wretch! would go on living to keep his name sweet in the ears of a woman
  who would forget it. She would be Paul Ferriby's...</p>

  <p>Gisberne struggled to his feet. He was smothering down there, his face
  hidden in the dark. He gasped for breath.</p>

  <p>What if he did find the strength, and went and returned and
  <i>conquered</i>? What if he made of himself even now a man stronger than any
  destiny, strong enough to slip the past as a dog the leash, and start for the
  goal and win the utmost yet&mdash;against the utmost?...He drew himself erect
  and started forward...Ah!</p>

  <p>He had no money. He could earn a living by the cards. He laughed, falling
  back against the table. He had made all the decent money he ever had made by
  the queer inborn skill he had shown Daphne Estorel that afternoon. He had
  asked her to keep it quiet. Well, yes, he couldn't very well turn that skill
  to account&mdash;his queer tricks with a teacup and the window-pane. Under
  the description of a famous 'improvisator,' he was wanted by the police.</p>

  <p>He might ask Mrs. Ibimay...He looked round, and noticed that she was gone.
  Well, that would have been a fine way to begin the climb of all-conquering
  heights, to take money from the woman he had cheated once already...No...he
  was done...As he stood holding the chair he had risen from, he heard the door
  opposite pushed gently open, and he caught the fragrance of flowers that have
  been bruised and are dying. He heard a rustle of rich material, and, looking
  up, saw Daphne Estorel, her dress untouched since the morning, even to the
  blossoms she wore crushed and drooping.</p>

  <p>As she came towards him, what he thought of was the unsettled bill at
  Droitlet, that his linen was of yesterday, his cheek rough. He had slipped
  back, failed, fallen...</p>

  <p>'Oh, you <i>have</i> been thinking...' she began. She paused beside him,
  searching his downcast face, her own pale with contrition; her eyes showed
  only the tenderest compassion, the saddest self-reproach. 'Why did I not
  think of it?' she said, reiterating words that during these hours had grown
  mechanical. 'I might have known...all <i>her</i> wretched doing...all...Why
  did it not occur to me it was her wickedness, her cunning...hers?'</p>

  <p>So true a woman...She saw the paper in his hands. 'You meant this for me?'
  she said. He let her take it. It was not so much that action was clear to him
  as that at such moments there is neither confusion nor resistance.</p>

  <p>'<i>You</i> guessed it was she from the first?' said Daphne, 'or perhaps
  not at the very first, not the very night itself? Did you?...'</p>

  <p>He turned his eyes to hers.</p>

  <p>'I have confessed it there,' he said.</p>

  <p>She tore the paper through and through and carried the pieces to the
  fire...</p>

  <p>'I am no one to judge you,' she said. She came back to him, and in piteous
  agitation laid her hand upon his arm. 'Think what <i>I</i> did, what <i>I</i>
  was ready to do...because I cared...You only let me go on thinking it was
  Paul...<i>He</i> might very well despise me...and I don't think you were
  sure...not till that evening when...' She broke off, weeping. 'I made it very
  difficult for you...Do you forgive me? Oh, to me, always, spite of this, you
  have been...splendid!'</p>

  <p>She turned her face towards him, her entreating eyes and trembling parted
  lips. He kissed her closely, long, and tenderly.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>He found himself walking away from the Grange. He reflected he must tramp
  to a distant town, pawn something there, tramp to London, and in some fashion
  get out of the country. His revolver was useless&mdash;a betrayal.</p>

  <p>He had undertaken to Daphne Estorel to live; only by living could he
  justify himself. He must live at a distance. Only by that could he retain
  Paul Ferriby's silence. Paul Ferriby knew and understood. She under stood and
  would never know. Life's little subtleties again; he appreciated them.</p>

  <p>He walked on steadily. Stopping at last, he knew himself exhausted. He was
  in a dull anguish, frightened at the hours before him piling one on the other
  for ever, for ever bringing the cursed want of money and the need of food.
  Oh, that he had not kissed her! He would go back.</p>

  <p>His face turned again in the direction of the Grange, or what he thought
  to be, Gisberne stumbled on...Suddenly the riddle was answered. He felt a
  brightness, an uplifting, a strange and ghostly soothing.</p>

  <p>'Was Irene Garth dead?' he thought. And then it came to him in some
  whisper that this was his own death. He sank down upon the ground, crossed
  his arms, and hid his face.</p>

  <p>'<i>'Tis said that some have died for love</i>.'</p>

  <p>With this epitaph upon the man who had called himself Robert Gisberne,
  Paul Ferriby never meddled. His own explanations and <i>his</i> love and
  wooing of Daphne Estorel are another story.</p>
