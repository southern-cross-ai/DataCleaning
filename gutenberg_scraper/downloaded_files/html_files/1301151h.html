<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>IT</small> seems desirable to state, for the
information of the general reader, that the line of New Guinea
coast, first placed on the chart by H.M.S. "Basilisk", had never
been visited, and was actually unknown as to its conformation (as
far as I have been able to discover any record), up to the period
of her first visit in 1873, between the wide limits of Heath
Island and Huon Gulf.</p>
<p>None of the navigators who did good service in the South Seas
and on other parts of the New Guinea coast, neared the coast-line
laid down by the "Basilisk" within these bounds, a fact as
singular as it is interesting.</p>
<p>By the courtesy of the present hydrographer of the Navy, I
have been able to take from a chart, constructed in his
department, the tracks of my predecessors in these waters, from
which the appended table has been compiled, which will show the
reader that up to the advent of the "Basilisk" in 1873, this
portion of the coast had been avoided by common consent, with a
sort of fatality; strange, indeed, when we consider the extent of
coast-line thus lying unknown, and the position held by the great
island of New Guinea on the habitable part of the globe.</p>

<br>
<p>Captain Owen Stanley, R.N., whose valuable survey on the
south-east coast is a source of pride to English seamen, never
passed round the east end of New Guinea, or we should have had a
shorter story to tell; or rather perhaps no story at all. His
work lay in the other direction; he commenced his New Guinea
survey about three miles south-west of Heath Island, and then ran
westward.</p>
<p>On this <i>great blank</i> of coast-line, some 340 miles in
extent (as the crow flies, save for the curve of Milne Bay) from
Heath Island to Huon Gulf, the only positions laid down were the
two solitary ones by D'Entrecasteaux in 1793 (situated 170 and
220 miles to the westward of East Cape), as seen from his second
and nearer point of approach. They were named by him respectively
"Cape Sud Est", and "Richie Island"; both these positions,
however, were incorrect. Cape Sud Est was placed by
D'Entrecasteaux in latitude 8&deg; 45' S., and longitude 148&deg;
18' E. (see Admiralty Chart, Coral Sea, sheet 2, A.D. 1869),
whereas the only cape-like projection of the land existing here,
one to which we have now transferred the name of Cape Sud Est, is
in latitude 8&deg; 41' S., and longitude 148&deg; 33' E., a
discrepancy which shows an error of some seventeen miles.</p>
<p>The position assigned to Cape Sud Est was further found by us
to fall on a range of high mountains, sixteen miles inland.</p>
<p>The north-east point of Richie Island, D'Entrecasteaux's
second position, was placed by him in latitude 8&deg; 7' S., and
longitude 147&deg; 54' E. (see Admiralty Chart, quoted above). No
island exists here, and the north-east point of the supposed
island falls some twelve miles inland, and some eighteen miles
from the cape which we have named Richie, on the "Basilisk's"
chart. D'Entrecasteaux, in sailing past this coast, had doubtless
caught two glimpses of high land in the interior, and very
naturally mistaken them for portions of a coast-line.</p>
<p>In its own place I shall refer to the valuable work done by
this old navigator beyond the limits of the "Basilisk's" special
survey.</p>
<p>From Huon Gulf to Astrolobe Bay, the "Basilisk's" voyage
ceased to be one of discovery; and her work between those limits
consisted in the making of needful corrections on the existing
chart of the coast-line, which was very little known.</p>
<p>It is not on record that any ship before the "Basilisk" had
ever passed from south to north New Guinea, without first going
some 240 miles to the eastward, to avoid the great Louisiade
reefs, which stretch that distance east. She has found a safe
ship channel through these reefs, and opened a highway for
commerce.</p>
<p>The "Basilisk" has placed on the chart more than 140 islands
and islets, of which 25 are inhabited; and has added many
excellent harbours and safe anchorages to our knowledge.</p>
<p>I specify the limits within which our task has lain, with an
anxious and painstaking distinctness, which will, I know, be
appreciated by my late shipmates; and I attempt in the pages that
follow to show how far we discharged it.</p>
<p>The results of our labours have been generously received by
those who understand them, but we wish our friends at large to
know exactly what we have done&mdash;no less&mdash;no more; and
to know that we have honestly tried to do the good that seemed to
lie within our power.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><small>LEAVE SYDNEY&mdash;FIRST VISIT TO
BRISBANE&mdash;INSIDE THE BARRIER REEF&mdash;THE "PERI", AND HER
STORY&mdash;THE SETTLEMENT AT CARDWELL&mdash;FITZROY ISLAND, AND
A WOODING PARTY.</small></p>
<p>"<small>OF</small> making many books there is no end", and I
have no desire to add to the number of books produced without
sufficient motive; but I trust that the work done by H.M.S.
"Basilisk", in waters hitherto untracked, on shores hitherto
untrodden, and amongst races hitherto unknown by Europeans, will
be held to call for some account.</p>
<p>I will try to take my reader to new ground, on the coasts of
New Guinea, and to some of the lovely adjacent islands of which
we were the discoverers; but I crave leave to make a digression
to Polynesia, even at the risk of saying a little that has been
better said by others.</p>
<p>On January 15th, 1871, H.M.S. "Basilisk", a steamship of 1031
tons, 400 horse-power, with five guns, and manned by 178 officers
and men, left Sydney, under orders to proceed to Cape York, with
horses and stores for that settlement, and to spend three months
in the cruise. The Cape York cruise was not generally thought an
inviting one, and we were somewhat loath to leave civilisation
and the kindness of our Sydney friends; but it offered variety,
and a hope of interest,&mdash;above all, a possibility of doing
some useful work.</p>
<p>We reached Brisbane on the 22d, and there, in conversing with
Lord Normanby (to whom we all owe gratitude for the kindest
hospitality), and the Hon. A. Palmer, Colonial Secretary, my
ideas as to profitable work to be done in northern waters began
to take definite shape. It was no small advantage to obtain an
insight into the views of two such men, possessed of a perfect
knowledge of the cumulative forces which have wrought out the
present aspects of Australian affairs, and much foresight of the
future; and this I hoped to turn to good account as opportunity
offered, as far as it should lie parallel with the routine of the
service and my duty.</p>
<p>Having taken on board the horses and stores for Cape York, and
filled up our coal, we took leave of Moreton Bay and the
mangrove-covered shores of Brisbane river on January 28th, and
left finally for our destination.</p>
<p>The voyage from Brisbane to Cape York is now a common one, and
is performed by two routes, one leading inside, and the other
outside, the Great Barrier Reef. We took the inner one, which is
now coming into general use, being shorter than the other, and of
course more sheltered. These advantages will in time outweigh the
difficulty of a somewhat more intricate navigation, and cause it
to be all but exclusively used.</p>
<p>It is generally known that the gigantic Barrier Reef runs
north and south for 1200 miles, at a distance varying from seven
to eighteen miles from the Queensland coast, and that it is
supposed to have originally been joined to the Australian
continent as a shore or fringing reef. It is submerged in parts,
generally to a shallow depth, and traceable only by the surf that
breaks on it, out of which a crowd of "nigger heads", black
points of coral rock, peep up in places; but here and there it
comes to the surface as a sandbank or vegetated island, or,
breaking its continuous line, leaves a channel or gateway open to
the sea, in which the plumb-line goes down to a bottomless depth.
The water inclosed by the Barrier Reef is everywhere studded with
islands, islets, coral banks, and hidden reefs, which would
render its navigation dangerous but for the admirable surveys of
Captains Owen Stanley and Francis Blackwood, by the help of whose
charts, and using caution, this intricate bye-way of the ocean
may be safely taken. No one, I think, but the responsible
navigator of a ship, using this route, can sufficiently admire
the skill and resolution of its first great explorer, Captain
Cook. Reading his voyages here, on the spot where he pioneered
the way, and considering his difficulties and his power of
resource, I recognised his greatness as I had never done before.
Unless a strong monsoon is blowing, the sailor moves inside this
great breakwater on a perfect summer sea, over calm translucent
water, whilst he sees the surf, and hears the roar of the
Pacific, thundering against its everlasting wall outside.</p>
<p>On the 5th of February we were slipping through a sea like
glass, blue as the sky that hung over, and watching the great
lazy water-snakes at play on the surface, all of us languid from
the intense heat, when the masthead-man reported "Sail right
ahead!" and waked us up in a moment&mdash;it was such an event to
see a sail. We almost hoped it might not belong to a kidnapper,
for the law was not then in a state to protect captors; but she
looked very like one&mdash;a small fore and aft schooner&mdash;as
she rose to our glasses. There was something puzzling about the
slovenly set of her sails, and she had a heavy water-logged look
as she swayed slowly with the long smooth undulations of the sea.
We hoisted the ensign to see what she would say to us, but there
was no response, so we steered to pass her close. There were
signs of strange neglect in the weather-beaten sails and
slackened ropes as we neared her, and not a soul was moving on
board; but just as we were thinking her abandoned, two or three
wild-looking creatures, Solomon Islanders, rose up in the stern,
and then we saw that others lay on the deck as if asleep.
Lieutenant Hayter, and Mr. Bently, the gunner, went with two
boats to board, and these men pointed muskets at them over the
side; but what men! they were living skeletons, creatures dazed
with fear and mortal weakness. As our crews boarded, other
half-dead wretches tottered to their feet, fumbling too at rusty,
lockless muskets, and our men disarmed them gently. They were
dreadful to look at&mdash;beings in the last stage of famine,
wasted to the bone; some were barely alive, and the sleeping
figures were dead bodies fast losing the shape of humanity, on a
deck foul with blood. We tried to show that we would not hurt
them, we gave them water, and it was awful to see their eagerness
to drink. Our men vied with each other in their rough cares, but
the help came too late for one one&mdash;dark Melanesian soul
passed away from the blood-stained deck, to find the mercy from
God which man had denied. There was no water on board, no food,
no boat by which they might have saved themselves. The hold was
full of the sea; and the ransacked cabin, the blood, the planking
splintered and scored by axe-strokes, told of a tragedy. Having
given our first succour to the living under Dr. Goodman's
direction, we turned to pump out the hold, and to bury the dead.
The bodies, six in number, were wrapped separately in a decent
canvas, and weighted, insufficiently as it proved, and the pumps
ceased clanging on board the "Peri", and our men stood
bare-headed as an officer read the words, "we commit their bodies
to the deep, in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to
eternal life." The poor remnants of mortality when launched
overboard did not sink, but floated away beyond our sight, mute
witnesses to heaven of a foul wrong.</p>
<p>The story of the "Peri" proved to be this:&mdash;A noted
kidnapping vessel, the "Nukulow", had brought a cargo of some 180
kidnapped natives to Rewa River, Fiji, some two months previous
to our falling in with the "Peri". At Rewa they were disposed of,
by being hired out to planters at the rate of ten to fifteen
pounds a-head, paid to the owners of the "Nukulow", and about
eighty of them were transferred to the "Peri" for conveyance to
various islands of the Fiji group, in charge of three white men,
and a Fijian crew. On getting to sea insufficient food was served
to the natives, who were quite unsecured, and they clamoured for
more, on which some rice was issued; but one of the white men,
angered by the clamour for food, was heartless enough to throw
the rice overboard as the natives were cooking it, and the
maddened creatures rose at once and threw him over after the
rice. The other two whites and the Fijians followed; and the
savages, thus left to themselves, and wholly unable to manage the
ship, drifted helpless and starving before the south-east trade
wind for about five weeks, accomplishing a distance of nearly
1800 miles, through a sea infested with coral reefs and full of
islands; finally passing either over a submerged part of the
Barrier Reef, or through one of its narrow openings, to the place
where the "Basilisk" found them. Thirteen only were then alive
out of the eighty natives who had sailed from Rewa. We took these
survivors to Cardwell, thirty miles distant, which was then,
excepting Cape York, the most northerly point of civilisation in
Queensland, and there, under the humane care of Mr. Brinsley
Sheridan, the police magistrate, they recovered strength in time,
and were afterwards taken by us to Sydney, whence they were
carried by one of H.M. ships to their various islands in the
Solomon group.</p>
<p>Cardwell, a lately-made Queensland settlement, stands at the
head of Rockingham Bay, in latitude 18&deg; 15' S., and longitude
146&deg; 5' E., in a clearing made in undulating and richly
tropical country, and the anchorage lies before the settlement.
The southern part of the bay is flanked by the lofty Goold and
Hinchinbrooke Islands, of which the highest point, Mount Bowen,
is 3600 feet high. The inner passage, between Hinchinbrooke
Island and the mainland, is an exquisite piece of scenery,
overshadowed by the frowning foliated peak of Mount Bowen on the
one shore, whilst from the other the densely-wooded lower
mainland stretches away till it meets the dark range of the Rocky
Hills ten miles inland.</p>
<p>Cardwell has few recommendations as a commercial port. The
most available approach to the anchorage is difficult, and too
shallow to be used by ships of heavy draught. Vessels drawing but
16 feet of water must lie two miles off the shore, but a pier is
being built which will partly obviate this difficulty. The place
consists of a line of tiny wooden houses running parallel to the
beach. In front of Mr. Sheridan's house young cocoa-nut trees,
planted by him as an experiment, are growing vigorously, the only
ones, strange to say, to be found in North or East Australia,
although they grow on Cocoa-nut Island, only about 20 miles off
Cardwell. The houses belong to Government officials; and there
are two general stores, and two houses of entertainment, for
gold-diggers on their way to and from the Etheridge gold-digging,
some 120 miles north-west of Cardwell.</p>
<p>Various tribes of Australian aborigines roam about the
vicinity, and not unnaturally regard the white men, who are
rapidly dispossessing them of their homes, as mortal enemies.
They show this feeling by committing murders and outrages, and
suffer terrible retaliation at the hands of our countrymen, who
employ native troopers, commanded by white men, to hunt down and
destroy the offenders when the opportunity offers.</p>
<p>The "Basilisk's" stay at Cardwell could not be prolonged, so,
leaving Mr. Sabben, navigating midshipman, and four men in charge
of the "Peri", with orders to wait our return, we stood away to
the north.</p>
<p>Eighty miles north of Cardwell, and only some three miles from
the mainland, lies Fitzroy Island, small, but lofty and well
timbered, affording every facility for wooding and watering, and
possessing a fine open bay on its north side, with a good
anchorage, which is sheltered from N.W. winds by its position
with regard to the high land of Cape Grafton on the mainland. I
had determined to lay in a good stock of wood there, so as to
economise our coal for any future emergency; so, on reaching the
island, we anchored under the shadow of its wooded centre hill,
abreast of a deep channel, where a mountain-stream cleaves
through the alluvial soil at its base. The greater force of the
sea has heaped up a coral beach across the outlet, and formed a
small brackish lagoon, from which the water filters slowly into
the sea. The trees are thick on the hill-side, but at the head of
the bay we observed that they stood more open, amongst rank grass
and huge rocky boulders, and thus offered better scope to our
woodcutters. Our men accordingly laboured all day there under a
burning vertical sun, felling and lopping the trees, whilst a
smaller party took water off to the ship. It was very hard work,
and we were new to it then. We little imagined that many hundred
tons of wood were to fall to our axes hereafter. The men, led by
Lieutenant Hayter, worked with cheery good humour, and turned the
occasion into a sort of holiday, but nobody was sorry when the
word was passed at sunset&mdash;"Knock off work! hands to bathe!
and a party to haul the seine!" Enjoyment commenced at once, and
the calm water became alive with officers and men enjoying its
delicious coolness after the exhausting work of the day. Our
party hauling the seine soon drew it in with a silvery freight,
and almost ere the fish had gasped their last they were broiling
on the embers of a large wood fire, and all hands crowded round
for supper. The officers who had been shooting returned with but
ill success, the cockatoos and parrots with which the island
abounds being too wild and cautious to let themselves be
approached within gunshot. I have always noticed that whilst
hawks, finches, ducks, and most other birds inhabiting places
unvisited by man are at first easily reached, and fall ready
victims, birds of the parrot kind are always wild from the
first.</p>
<p>On the following day, February 9th, after getting the wood on
board, we left Fitzroy Island and proceeded on towards Cape York,
anchoring each night to avoid the dangerous reefs which lay in
our course.</p>
<p>Nearing Cape York, the great Barrier Reef approaches to within
five or six miles of the Australian coast, and the narrow
navigable channel between the reefs becomes more tortuous, for
islets and sandbanks thicken.</p>
<p>We often looked for turtle on these banks and islets, but
mostly in vain; for between the months of December and March
light winds prevail, and the natives come from the mainland in
their fragile canoes and betake themselves to these off-lying
islets to fish and take turtle, and we nearly always found
ourselves forestalled. At other seasons strong winds prevail, and
the natives do not venture from the land. Our shooting parties on
the islands were more fortunate, and succeeded in making good
bags of pigeons and doves; our men amusing themselves the while
on the coral reefs like children; splashing knee-deep in water
after the fishes that darted about in all directions, breaking
off the coral that branched from below in every variety of shape
and colour, picking up the beautiful courie, cream-coloured with
black spots, and other shells, from the tiniest to the huge clam
with a hinge like that of a jail door. But shooting and exploring
had always to terminate before evening fell, for the crowds of
vicious mosquitoes that then darkened the air would have driven
the boldest from the islets and reefs.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><small>CAPE YORK AND THE SETTLEMENT AT
SOMERSET&mdash;CITY OF THE WHITE ANTS&mdash;BOAT EXPEDITION TO
ISLANDS OF TORRES STRAITS&mdash;A CAMP OF AUSTRALIAN
ABORIGINES&mdash;SEARCH FOR THE DANGEROUS ROCK OFF SADDLE ISLAND,
AND FIND IT.</small></p>
<p><small>ON</small> February 16th we reached our destination,
Cape York, and anchored off the settlement of Somerset. This
extreme northern point of Queensland was first settled in 1866,
under the supervision of Sir George Bowen and Commodore Burnett,
R.N., who thought, from its geographical position, that it would
become another Singapore in importance. These anticipations have
not been realised, and the party of Royal Marines which guarded
the settlement has been removed. There are but six white settlers
now,&mdash;the Government police magistrate, and his boat's crew;
the other fifteen or twenty men resident here are native troopers
and pearl-shell divers; and most of the wooden houses are falling
into decay from the ravages of the white ant. The gardens
cultivated by the marines have now grown wild, and the small
cleared spaces before the inhabited wooden houses, alone are free
from primeval forest or bush.</p>
<p>We landed the horses we had brought up by swimming them on
shore, although the sea abounded with sharks&mdash;the noise they
made, and the splashing of a boat's oars behind them preventing
an attack, so that we landed all safely, to the delight of Mr.
Jardine, the police magistrate, who needed them to follow the
cattle of the settlement, which are constantly escaping through
its broken fences into the bush.</p>
<p>Somerset is situated on the northern extreme of Queensland,
where it dips in a series of steep hills, covered with dense
tropical forest, to the waters of Albany Pass. This strait which
separates Albany Island from Somerset is a narrow slip of water,
about seven miles in length, and from half to three quarters of a
mile wide; free from rocks or shoals, and possessing a
comfortable depth of water for anchorage, but is not a good
channel for ships, as fierce tides sweep through it, and the
uncertainty of the winds between the high lands renders it
dangerous of approach to a sailing vessel. The anchorage is off
Somerset, in a small bay, between two points of the mainland, and
is narrowed by a coral and sand reef, which extends from the
beach, so that not more than half-a-dozen ships can lie there
together. From the landing-place, now in ruin, where you step or
wade ashore, according to the state of the tide, the path leads
through bush, and a luxuriant growth of ferns and creepers, which
has usurped the place of the fruit and vegetables of the Royal
Marines' gardens, to Mr. Jardine's house, which stands on the
brow of a steep hill some 150 feet high, overlooking Albany Pass.
It is a simple wooden bungalow, surrounded by the usual verandah,
and standing in a small cleared space, with a stockyard for the
cattle, and a few wooden huts for the native servants, and others
in the rear. On a similar hill, half-a-mile distant, are built
the white police quarters, and a storehouse for every article of
consumption required. But they are fast falling into decay under
the attack of the white ant, and no attempt is made to arrest the
ruin, for the inhabitants are absorbed directly or indirectly in
the pearl-shell fishery, and a feeling also prevails that the
site is a bad one, and that before long the settlement will move
to one of the Torres Straits islands, whence ready and safe
communication can be held with the commerce of the world. Thick
Australian bush runs up to the rear of the settlement, opening
here and there into glades, where cattle can find pasture. About
one mile from Somerset, at the eastern entrance to Albany Pass,
the land is low, flat, and bare of trees, and there the Termites,
or white ants, have established themselves in a gigantic city,
consisting of many hundreds of ant-houses. These dwellings, which
are built of red clay, vary from one foot to sixteen feet in
height, with a diameter equal to the height, and are irregular
cones, covered with smaller cones and turrets. At a distance this
termite city looks like a military encampment, and was very
puzzling to us when we first saw it on entering Albany Pass. It
is strange that insects should build such palaces, and the human
being who inhabits this country take no example, but remains
incapable of constructing the smallest hut.</p>
<p>Our orders permitted us ten days' stay at Somerset, of which
three only would be occupied in refitting, and taking on board
some coal which was lying on the beach, so I began to think of
making a boat expedition to the islands in Torres Straits, to
which many reasons inclined me. A dangerous sunken rock, not
marked on the chart, was known to lie off Saddle Island, directly
in the course recommended by the Admiralty charts, through the
great north-east channel of Torres Straits. Two vessels had
already been wrecked on it, and I wished not only to find this
rock, but also to fix the position of other reefs now becoming
dangerous, because of the increasing traffic in Torres
Straits.</p>
<p>I had been informed that illegal acts were being perpetrated
at the pearl-shelling and b&ecirc;che-de-mer stations, on islands
which had never as yet been visited by a man-of-war; that the
imported native divers were detained there beyond their
stipulated period of service, and so ill fed as to be driven to
make raids on the supplies of the native inhabitants&mdash;a
situation calculated to provoke all sorts of evils. I desired to
examine into this state of affairs, as also into the condition of
certain Polynesian missionary teachers lately established by the
London Missionary Society on Cornwallis Island, who were reported
to be in peril from the natives, and needing either protection or
removal. Lastly, it seemed desirable to visit as many as possible
of the islands lying in Torres Straits, off the south coast of
New Guinea, three or four of which had already become seats of
the pearl-shelling and b&ecirc;che-de-mer industries, so as to
gain some general ideas as to their character, products, and
inhabitants, and the peculiarities of the surrounding navigation.
The time at our disposal was very short for the accomplishment of
such purposes, so we determined to make the most of it, and on
Sunday 18th left the ship in two boats: Lieutenant Hayter, Mr.
Jones, sub-lieutenant, Mr. Waters, midshipman, Dr. Haines, Mr.
Bently the gunner, and four seamen, in a boat belonging to the
police-magistrate; and Navigating-Lieutenant Mourilyan, Mr. Pitt,
midshipman, and Mr. Mudge the boatswain, with me in the pinnace,
Mr. Chester, formerly police-magistrate of Somerset, being our
pilot.</p>
<p>We passed out at the west end of Albany Pass, entered Torres
Straits, and stood north under sail, hardly clearing the Pass
when we met with heavy squalls; but the boat made good way, and
we did very well until, getting into some heavy tide-races, we
shipped a quantity of water, and had rather an anxious time. This
over, matters mended a little, and hoping for better weather, we
pressed on.</p>
<p>As night wore, the squalls came down with unexpected fury, and
the blinding downpour of rain, and heavy confused sea, made our
position a trying one. It was as easy to go on as to retrace our
way, and we could not even keep the binnacle light burning to see
how we were steering. To add to our discomfort, nearly every one
was sea-sick. I had many an anxious thought as to our safety, and
that of the other boat, and longed for the day; but when day
broke it did not help us much&mdash;the weather was as thick as a
hedge; we had no idea as to our whereabouts, we were surrounded
by reefs and rocks, the boat was labouring heavily, and shipping
water fast; but I hoped that the breeze was beginning to blow
itself out. Suddenly, whistling and seething, down came a white
squall, looking innocent as a babe after the inky black squalls
that had persecuted us all night, but big with mischief; we just
saw the water ripping towards us in time to get the after sail
in, but ere we could touch the foresail the wind had struck us,
and the foremast was broken, and the sail in the water.</p>
<p>After this it cleared a little, and we made out our position
as some twelve miles to leeward of where we had supposed, and
found that we had providentially passed through a belt of coral
islets and reefs, on any one of which it would have been
destruction to have struck. Mr. Hayter's boat was nowhere to be
seen, but we knew that she was lighter and higher out of the
water than our pinnace, and had been expressly built for service
in these seas. I thought it probable that he would stand on to
our destination, and be perplexed at not meeting us there; but
the state of the weather, and our disabled condition, left me no
alternative; we jury-rigged the boat, and put about. Jenkins, the
coxswain, contrived to light a fire, when no one else could, and
give us something hot to drink, which helped us to throw off the
effects of wet and cold.</p>
<p>A fearful afternoon succeeded, with wind and heavy sea, and
incidents of squalls, tide-races, and coral reefs, that kept us
in constant peril, and over all, the relentless rain fell in a
deluge; but the men's spirits never flagged, and that fine
seaman, Mr. Mudge, showed his quality then, as he did on many a
future occasion. At sunset the wind went down. We lowered masts
and sails, and after some hours of weary pulling, got under the
shelter of a mountainous island, and anchored in a little bay,
smooth as a mill-pond. It was raining heavily still, but rest and
safety made us forget that, and we slept soundly. Once or twice I
started awake, mistaking the rushing of a cascade on shore for
the sound of rising wind, but all was calm. We roused up early
next morning, breakfasted on a piece of biscuit and a glass of
rum and water, had morning prayer, and started for the ship. It
was still raining, but the wind was down, and we had a good
strong tide behind us. During a lift in the thick weather we
caught sight of Mr. Hayter's boat at anchor under the lee of a
small island, and he of us, and this wrung a hearty cheer of
relief from both crews.</p>
<p>The "Basilisk" was a welcome sight, for I had felt doubtful of
ever putting my men on board her again, but we were much
disappointed by this failure of our first effort.</p>
<p>On the 21st, finding that the work of fitting out the ship for
sea was progressing well, I rode out with Mr. Jardine to visit a
camp of North Australian aborigines, within a few miles of
Somerset. The encampment, if such it could be called, consisted
of nothing but a row of leafy branches stuck in the ground, under
the lee of which the savages crouched for shelter from sun and
wind. These poor people are evidently of the very low type of
humanity which all writers assign them, a black straight-haired
race, with an animal expression of countenance; the young men,
tall, lithe, and able looking; but all who had even touched on
middle-age, wretched, decrepid creatures, with bones almost
starting from the skin. These poor people did not appear to have
any occupation or amusement; the men were lolling listlessly
about, some smoking; and the women, sad, haggard-looking beings,
were roasting roots and small fish on embers, watched by a tribe
of children who kept anxious eyes on the food. The only weapons
we saw were spears of the least cunning shape, waddys, and
clubs.</p>
<p>It is strange that these people have never learnt to cultivate
the earth and build houses, but remain content to wander about,
living precariously on wild fruits, grubs, a little chance fish,
and such animals as they can spear, whilst their Papuan
neighbours, in the near Torres Straits islands build good huts,
supply themselves with constant vegetable food, and have fine
canoes for fishing.</p>
<p>The tribe came on board the "Basilisk" in the evening, and
treated us to a corroborie. The dancers, who were all young men,
were decked with fillets of leaves, and moved in harmony with the
idea they intended to convey, such as the "Pursuit of enemies",
"The struggle", "The victory", accompanied by much clapping of
hands from the women and older men. Their dances afforded a
measure of the narrow range of their habits, and fell far below
the really pictorial efforts which were afterwards made for our
amusement by the Warrior Island natives.</p>
<p>Our first attempt to cross the Straits in the boats having
failed, I had now to consider how far I should be justified in
risking H.M. ship in the dangerous navigation of Torres Straits
without authority, especially as two years previously H.M.S.
"Blanche", in a somewhat similar attempt, had been almost totally
lost on a coral reef a few miles from Cape York, and had only
been saved by good seamanship. The limits of the Australian
station, which have since been altered to embrace the whole of
New Guinea, then extended only to a few miles north of Cape York,
and to carry out my intention of visiting the pearl-shell
stations close to New Guinea, I should have to take the
"Basilisk" inside the limits of the China station. Knowing,
however, that the pearl-shelling establishments, lying outside
the limit line of the station, called for inspection, I
determined to incur this responsibility.</p>
<p>Torres Straits, which divide New Guinea from Australia, are
about 200 miles long, with a least breadth of 80 miles between
Cape York and the opposite coast of New Guinea. At this part the
depth of water nowhere exceeds twelve fathoms, the average being
from eight to nine fathoms, elsewhere in the Straits the depth is
somewhat greater, but rarely exceeds twenty fathoms. The entire
area of the Straits is strewn with coral reefs and sandbanks, and
with islands, the larger of which are of volcanic origin, well
wooded, some of them seven or eight hundred feet, and varying in
size from four or five to thirty-five miles in circumference. The
smaller are low white islands of coral formation, scarcely raised
ten feet above the sea-level, covered with small vegetation, but
rarely possessing cocoa-nut, and never bread-fruit trees, both of
which grow so luxuriantly on all the other South Sea islands.</p>
<p>Through these reefs and islands a tolerably safe channel has
been admirably sounded out and surveyed by Captain Francis
Blackwood, of H.M.S. "Fly", in 1843-5, but the northern shores of
Torres Straits, and the islands adjacent to the coast of New
Guinea, had not been surveyed, and in some cases had not been
seen, by Captain Blackwood or his officers, since whose time no
man-of-war had approached them. A few miles to the west of Cape
York a series of lofty volcanic islands, succeeded by lines of
coral reefs, with very narrow channels for ships between, lie
like giant stepping-stones between the hills of Queensland and
the low mangrove shores of New Guinea, and suggest the idea,
which examination confirms, that at one time in the history of
the world New Guinea and Australia were one land.</p>
<p>We left our anchorage at Somerset on Thursday, and steered for
Saddle Island. Near this island, which is twenty miles from Cape
York, a dangerous rock, as I have mentioned, had been reported as
lying directly off it, in the fairway through Torres Straits. As
we dropped anchor before this fertile and hilly, though
uninhabited island, Torres Straits, lately so tempestuous when we
attempted to cross in the boats, lay like a sheet of glass,
unruffled by even a cat's-paw; but I hoped that something of a
breeze might stir in the morning, ere the sun got power, so as to
ruffle the water a little over the rock, and guide us to its
position; but at daylight there was no breeze&mdash;not a
sigh&mdash;the sea lay like oil, glaring back to the vertical
sun. We got out four boats and swept the water for the rock,
dropping our leads for hours, but had no success, and time being
short made no longer delay, but left for the pearl shelling
station on Brothers' Island, twenty-eight miles to the north.
Three days afterwards, however, we made a second search, and,
when almost in despair of finding, Mr. Jones in the little dingy
suddenly hoisted the ensign to tell us that he had carried away
the honour from the other boats, and touched the rock with his
lead. His success was received by us with acclamations, for we
had all become interested in the search, and felt a satisfaction
that all sailors will understand in unmasking a danger which lay
in wait for our brother seamen. We anchored the dingy over the
rock, and hoisted the ensign in her to make a mark
distinguishable from a distance, and Mr. Mourilyan and I took a
round of bearings and fixed the position. This dangerous rock, or
bank, has but six feet of water over it, and rises up only
half-a-mile from the track taken by all vessels passing through
the Straits.</p>

<p><small>HAVING</small> fixed the position of the reef off
Saddle Island, we steered for an island which lies about sixty
miles north of Cape York, and twenty from the coast of New
Guinea, called by the natives "Gabba", and by the pearl-shellers
"The Brothers", from the circumstance of its possessing two high
hills bearing a fanciful resemblance to each other. This island
is one of the principal pearl-shelling stations in Torres
Straits, and is situated almost in the centre of those fisheries.
It had not, to our knowledge, ever been visited by a man-of-war,
though it had been seen and its position fixed by the officers of
H.M.S. "Fly", twenty-five years before; and it lay not only in
unsurveyed waters, but also beyond the limit of the Australian
station. A few hours after leaving Saddle Island we passed this
Rubicon, and broke into the waters of the China station, with an
anxious desire on my part that the assumption of such
responsibility might be justified by success.</p>
<p>As we neared The Brothers, we observed a large detached
unknown reef lying off it, and therefore approached with much
caution, finally securing a good anchorage, about half-a-mile off
the north side of the island, which is surrounded by these great
submerged coral reefs, some of which are twenty or thirty miles
in length, with a breadth sometimes as large, on which, but
principally in the narrow ruts and channels which intersect them,
lie the valuable pearl-shell oysters. The newly-discovered reef
was carefully surveyed by Mr. Mourilyan, and now bears his
name.</p>
<p>The great pearl-shell fisheries of Torres Straits are
principally worked by Sydney capital and owners, Queensland and
Victoria being but partially represented. Two modes were till
lately used in obtaining divers; one was for the small schooners
used in the trade, after shipping as many native divers as could
be had at Sydney, to go to the islands&mdash;generally the
Loyalty, Solomon; and New Hebrides groups&mdash;and hire
islanders to fill up their complement. Under these circumstances,
the natives were generally much wronged in the bargain made with
them; induced to leave their homes under promises of short
service and good wages, which were made to be broken, as they
were kept for years beyond the time agreed on, in a state of
veritable slavery. This means of securing the needful labour was
shown guiltless indeed, however, beside the other, which was
nothing more nor less than an organised system of kidnapping,
attended at times with atrocities, that it blanches the cheek and
makes the blood run cold to hear of. The islanders were induced
to go on board the ships as visitors on various pretences, and
then seized and fastened down; or else captured from their canoes
whilst fishing, and, without being allowed one parting word to
their relatives, hurried off to slavery. The schooners having
thus by hook or by crook collected some forty or fifty natives,
steered for the fishing-grounds in Torres Straits, and anchored
off the island chosen for a station. The inhabitants of these
Torres Straits islands are black Papuans&mdash;like those of the
opposite New Guinea coast&mdash;a fierce and warlike race, armed
with powerful bows and arrows. But they have been taught by the
pearl-shellers, who have been politic in respecting their rights
during the eight or nine years of the existence of the fishery,
to know the value of friendly intercourse. Low corrugated iron
buildings are erected by the pearl-sheller on the island chosen,
or, as in some cases, the Papuan huts are used, and the
provisions and materials needed for the prosecution of the
fishery are stored there, in charge of a white, or
English-speaking native storekeeper. Five or six large open boats
form the fishing fleet at a station, each carrying a party of
eight or ten divers, commanded by a leading man from the schooner
as coxswain. The divers, who live either in huts erected for them
on shore, when not engaged on the reefs, or on board the vessel,
are generally absent from headquarters in the boats for one or
two weeks together, on parts of these gigantic submerged reefs
which encumber the sea for many hundreds of square miles in
Torres Straits, and return when they have filled up with shell.
At the time of this visit we found that only in rare instances
had even the form of an agreement been entered into between the
masters of the pearl-shelling vessels and the divers; and that in
numerous instances the divers had been obtained by force or
fraud, and were now improperly detained year after year, earning
enormously for the owners, but receiving little for their labour
save food, tobacco, and some bright calico for clothing. The
daily bill of fare for the divers, as officially supplied to me
by a white man in charge of a station, was this for breakfast,
two small pannikins of rice, each about the size of a large
breakfast-cup; for dinner, one pannikin of "sharps", <i>i.e</i>.
an inferior kind of flour, which is converted into doughboys; for
supper, the same allowance as for dinner. They had no tea nor
molasses supplied to them, nor any other food; but it was said
that they could go out on the reefs and catch fish. Salt meat was
in store, but was only issued to the white men, and to the man
who is rated captain of the boat, who was allowed some three
times a week. At the close of the year, when the setting in of
the north-west monsoon makes the passage to Sydney easy, the
schooners take their cargo of thirty or forty tons of pearl shell
on board and sail for Sydney, where it is valued at &pound;150 to
&pound;180 per ton.</p>
<p>A proportion of the South Sea Islanders who had brought this
treasure up from the depth of the sea used to be taken back to
Sydney, on these visits; but the poor savages, soon spending
their small earnings there, were generally glad to ship on board
the schooner again, sometimes in the belief that they were to be
carried back to their native islands, as was frequently promised
them, and but too often in vain. Due north of The Brothers, the
high peak of Cornwallis could be seen about twenty miles off, and
occasionally, when raised by the mirage, the low wooded outline
of Sybai island, lying about four miles from the New Guinea
coast, not marked on any chart, and only recently brought into
knowledge by the pearl shellers. One of our objects had been to
rescue some native missionaries, said to be ill treated on these
islands; but the information collected at The Brothers disproved
the statements made, and giving up the idea of visiting Sybai, we
proceeded direct to Warrior Island, about thirty miles distant to
the east. Warrior Island is a contrast to lofty, volcanic
Brothers, being nothing but a vegetated sandbank on a coral reef,
not more than two miles in circumference, with a salt water
lagoon in the centre, and covered with scanty bush, nevertheless,
it is the home of one of the most powerful tribes in Torres
Straits. These natives in former years attacked a man-of-war
becalmed near the island, and were with difficulty beaten off,
hence the name of the island. It may appear strange that so
inconsiderable a spot should be a greater power than islands in
the Straits twenty times its size; but Warrior Island commands
the fishing of the great coral reef which now bears its name, and
is thus enabled to maintain a large population, and to employ its
many canoes, which have proved a very aggressive navy, until the
advent of the pearl-shellers, which has turned the minds of their
owners from thoughts of war to those of trade for axes, tobacco,
turkey red, and European food.</p>
<p>The approach to Warrior Island is full of difficulty, not so
much because of the uncertain position of the reefs as from the
fierce tides pent in by them, which sweep with great velocity
through the deep narrow channels. Unaware of this, we approached
in fancied security, but being caught by one of these fierce
tidal streams, were suddenly swept close to an outlying portion
of the Warrior Island reef. The anchor was immediately let go,
but with a bad holding ground, and the tide running five knots it
failed to hold, and we dragged swiftly along the edge of the
dangerous reef. Providentially, the tide did not set on the reef,
but ran parallel to it, which gave us some breathing time; and
whilst anxiously endeavouring to hold our position by riding with
a long scope of cable, and steaming ahead to stem the tide, we
found ourselves swept into comparatively quiet waters, where the
ship rode safely to her anchor. A survey the following morning
showed that we had been swept into a horseshoe curve in the reef,
past which the body of the tide rushed without entering.</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the genuineness of the welcome given us
by Mr. Bedford, who was in charge of this, the largest, and, I
may add, best-conducted, pearl shell station in the Straits. He
hailed us as the first naval officers who had ever landed on this
tiny islet, and told me of the lively recollection the natives
still retained of the attack made by their forefathers on the
man-of-war, from which they had claimed the victory, inasmuch she
had sailed away from them. As I looked at the formidable war
canoes, fifty and sixty feet long, hauled up on the beach, and
the powerful men ready to man them, all armed with six-foot bows,
requiring muscle as strong as that which shot at Agincourt to
draw them, and send the poisoned arrows true to the mark at
eighty yards, I felt that they might easily have proved awkward
customers to an old-fashioned sailing man-of-war.</p>
<p>The station belonged to Messrs. Merriman, of Sydney, who, it
appeared, were honestly anxious to do the right and just thing
towards the South Sea Islanders and other natives in their
employ, but could not always control the actions of the masters
in their vessels, so difficult was it at that time to obtain
labour from the South Sea Islands without transgressing on the
rights of the islanders. Mr. Bedford, ready, rough, kindly, and a
skilful organiser, had commanded a body of thirty South Sea
Islanders here since the previous year, assisted by two white men
as cook and carpenter, and amply supplied with boats, storehouse,
and huts for the fishers. He had been left alone on the island
whilst the vessel went to Sydney and returned, and during its
absence had induced forty-four of the Warrior Island natives to
associate themselves with him, and man two of the boats under a
chief in each. The competition between these boats and those
manned by the South. Sea Islanders was now very keen, and Mr.
Bedford gave the palm to the Warrior men, who generally succeeded
in obtaining more shell than their rivals. Such was the
ascendency obtained by him over these people, that just before
our arrival they had held a meeting and solemnly elected him a
chief.</p>
<p>Inspecting the store-rooms, which contained provisions, axes,
knives, bright calicoes, tobacco, and other articles of
incalculable value to savages, I remarked, with surprise, that
nothing was secured with anything stronger than a clumsy lock,
but Mr. Bedford assured me that even this was a needless
precaution, as none of the islanders would steal from him.</p>
<p>I was unfortunate in not meeting the South Sea Islanders, as
they were absent fishing, except one or two who were sick. One of
these was a poor fellow who had been fearfully torn by a shark
whilst diving for pearl-shell, and was now a hopeless cripple for
life, the sinews of the thigh having been divided, but he was
quite cheerful, and Mr. Bedford told me that he would be taken
care of, and never suffered to want.</p>
<p>The divers go down in four and six fathom water, in localities
abounding with sharks, but are very rarely attacked, probably
because so many dive together as to alarm the sharks. I only know
of one other accident having happened, by which a woman was
similarly injured. The women, as a rule, are considered more
dependable divers than the men.</p>
<p>The pearl-shell oyster of Torres Straits is a magnificent
oyster, weighing from three to six pounds, in some instances
reaching a weight of even ten pounds. The divers frequently bring
one up under each arm. The oysters are opened at once, when taken
into the boat, and the fish used as food; the pearls, if any,
falling to the share of the crew, but the pearls are few, small,
and of poor quality.</p>
<p>After dark Mr. Bedford proposed that we should see a
corroborie, which he promised us should far exceed the
performance of the aborigines at Cape York, and sent messages to
the chiefs, whilst I sent on board the "Basilisk" to summon all
our people who could be spared; and in a short time the tribe had
assembled in front of the station, where nearly all our officers
and a large number of men had gathered to see the sight.</p>
<p>It was a striking one, for a huge wood fire threw a broad
light on the tall naked figures of the savages, and painted them
sharp against the darkness. The old men and women crouched in a
ring, and enclosed the dancers, droning out a slow chant, to
which they clapped in time, and beat rude drums, always
quickening as the dancers quickened. These gave us a battle
dance, and chased their enemies with guttural cries, tossing
their bracelated arms, and heads decked with long cassowary
plumes, as they rushed; their eyes flashing, and the whole body
alive with fierce excitement, till they looked more like evil
spirits than men. The dance was a perfect study from reality;
they made signs of all their actions of war, drew the bow and
threw missiles, and bounded on their enemies at last and slew
them, with a semblance that was frightfully like reality. Better
things were the picture dances representing scenes in daily life,
such as spearing the dugong, fishing, love making; and the last
and most graceful of all was one which illustrated the coming of
the north-west monsoon, and the consequent planting of yams,
taro, and sweet potatoes&mdash;a poem in a dance. Nothing more
perfectly graceful could be seen than their movements, as,
rapidly gliding round the fire with swaying bodies and inflected
limbs, they showed how the wind blew, how the ground was turned
up and the seed sown, and ended with a joyous dance. We were
never fortunate enough to see any dance amongst the Malay race,
except the few meaningless steps which we sometimes enticed the
bolder youths to perform when on board, perhaps because our
movements in East New Guinea were too rapid to give the natives
time to subside from the excitement which our visit caused into
their normal state of work and play.</p>
<p>The following day was Sunday, and deluges of rain prevented us
from holding divine service. I was anxious to make the most of
the disposable time, and as we could not stretch our time so as
to visit the remaining pearl shelling stations, I determined to
get the Warrior Island natives on board, and impress them with a
sense of our power, that they would be likely to spread in their
intercourse with other tribes in the Straits, as this might prove
a sort of protection to wrecked or isolated white men. Mr.
Bedford went with me to the village and used all his powers of
persuasion, and I seconded his efforts by giving the people beads
and trinkets, and making signs that they should have plenty to
eat if they would accompany me on board the "big war canoe", but
we found them very unwilling, and evidently alarmed lest evil
should happen them. Mr. Bedford's influence at length so far
prevailed, that nearly all the young and able-bodied men of the
tribe set out with us for our boats, which lay a mile off, on the
opposite side of the island; but as they walked their courage
oozed out, and with all our whipping-in we only brought about
twenty of the bravest off.</p>
<p>The jokes and good humour of our blue-jackets somewhat allayed
their fears as the distance increased between them and the land,
but they stepped on deck as frightened as sheep. A few trifling
presents were given them, and they were regaled with abundance of
sweet hot tea, which is their delight, and soon became reassured,
and began to express wonderment at the number of white men and
the bigness of the ship. We put them on the bridge, and fired
shot and shell, and they screamed and shouted with amazement.
Some stopped their ears and crouched down, but the boldest stood
upright beside us, and expressed their wonder with a loud
"coo-ee!" as they saw a column of spray thrown up by the shot at
3000 or 4000 yards distance.</p>
<p>After supplying them well with tobacco and biscuit, we sent
them on shore, proud and happy, to be envied by the timid
ones.</p>
<p>At Warrior Island I met two of the native missionaries from
the Loyalty group, who some nine months previous had been landed
with three other teachers and their families on Saibai and
Cornwallis Islands, to begin a mission work for the London
Missionary Society, which would extend to the coast of New
Guinea.</p>
<p>Every impartial man must heartily and thankfully admit that
vast benefits have resulted from missionary enterprise in the
South Seas; but no human arrangements are perfect, and I have no
fear of being misunderstood if I say that in some cases zeal
overruns prudence, and new stations are occupied before a proper
staff has been organised or means of support ensured. The English
missionaries, however, show all the pluck and tenacity of
Englishmen, and although their first efforts may result in
failure for a time, the good cause is fought for till success is
won.</p>
<p>A case of what one would incline to call rashness came now to
my notice. Here were two South Sea Islanders, instructed only
since they had reached manhood in the truths of Christianity, and
holding them like children in a simple illogical way, brought up
by the missionaries in a state of dependence, indolent by habit
and constitution, and they had been suddenly transplanted from
their home and semi-civilised associates, a thousand miles hence,
and placed here amongst these fierce Papuan warriors, of whose
language and habits they knew nothing. Two clergymen, the Revs.
S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; M'Farlane and A. W. Murray, had brought
them to Cape York, and from thence taken and stationed them at
Cornwallis and Saibai, giving some tomahawks and trade to the
chiefs to propitiate them, and purchase the ground on which the
teachers were to build their huts.</p>
<p>The teachers were provided with a small stock of provisions
and trade, and were then left to their own devices, the clergymen
returning to Sydney. As long as the trade lasted, and they could
purchase food, for supplies of which they were soon entirely
dependent on the natives, all went well; but when the Papuans
found that the burden of supporting these missionaries and their
wives and children would be thrown on them,&mdash;people, too,
with whom they could hold no converse, and who had no
recommendation in their eyes except that of being protected by
white men,&mdash;they naturally refused to accept the position.
Painful scenes accordingly took place; they used to bring food to
the teachers and take it away again when no payment was offered
in return. The unfortunate creatures were thus ready to starve,
but for the liberality of Mr. Bedford's employers, who permitted
him to supply them free of charge. The teachers had now come to
Warrior Island from their station at Cornwallis, about thirty
miles distant, principally to get medicine and nourishing food
for their ailing wives; and a collection was made on board the
"Basilisk" on their behalf, which enabled them to return with
lightened hearts. These poor teachers did not pretend that they
exercised the slightest influence over the Papuans, but they
hoped in time to learn the language and become useful.</p>
<p>The time permitted for our stay in Torres Straits having
elapsed, we returned south inside the great Barrier Reef, calling
on our way at some of the only historic spots the Australian
colonies possess&mdash;places connected by some incident with the
history of Captain Cook's voyages. The first of these was Lizard
Island, so called by Cook because the reptile abounded. Here,
about fifteen miles off the mouth of the Endeavour River, where
his little vessel had been all but destroyed on a neighbouring
coral reef, he remained two days; each day ascended its peak,
1200 feet high, to look for an opening in the great Barrier by
which his vessel, when repaired, might gain the open sea, and
each day returned disappointed by hazy weather. It is well known
that Cook then thought it impossible to trace the Australian
coast any farther inside the Reef. He found a passage through to
the open sea in the end, and was rejoicing in safety, when a calm
ensued, and his ship, swept on by the combined influence of swell
and current, would have been dashed to pieces on the outside, had
not Providence launched her back again through a narrow opening,
which he well named Providential Channel, into the still waters
inside. From this point he again traced the Australian coast to
its final northern point.</p>
<p>After much difficult climbing I stood at last on the bare
windy top of Lizard Island, and gazed on the scene which had met
the eyes of our great sailor just 102 years before; thinking with
a new wonder on the skill, indomitable energy, and courage he had
shown in matching his frail, lonely vessel against such odds. I
do not think our country remembers as she should, the debt of
gratitude she owes Cook for writing the home-names on so large a
portion of the map of the world. We anchored off the mouth of
Endeavour River on the evening of the 5th of March, so as to pass
some dangerous shoals in the vicinity by daylight. The spot where
Cook hove down and repaired his vessel, the "Endeavour", was just
as he had left it; for though a few passing white men have
occasionally visited it, they have left no trace. I had Cook's
picture of the place in my hand as I landed, and had no
difficulty in steering my boat to the exact spot on which the
"Endeavour" was beached. Since our visit, the report of gold
found at the Palmer diggings, some 200 miles inland, has brought
a rush of settlers to the place; a township, appropriately named
Cooktown, has formed itself at the entrance of the river, and
having made the rapid growth characteristic of most Australian
towns, already musters a population of 10,000 people; has three
banks, a daily newspaper, and all the appointments of a
full-grown city.</p>

<p><small>WE</small> returned to Cardwell, and arrived there
March 9th, when Mr. Sabben, the officer I had left in charge of
the "Peri", came on board with tidings of the wreck of a brig on
the great Barrier Reef; having, besides her crew, seventy-five
spirited young men from Sydney on board, who had attempted a
prospecting expedition to New Guinea. They had clubbed together,
at the rate of ten pounds a-piece, and bought the "Maria", a
crazy old brig of 167 tons, as ill-found aloft as she was leaky
below; and had fortune favoured, might have reached New Guinea,
for all went well for a fortnight, and they had come within 400
miles of the desired coast. There their misfortunes commenced,
for they met the north-west monsoon, accompanied by heavy gales,
lost spars and sails, and were driven south again, with the
ship's hull strained and leaking badly. The men, pent in such
narrow quarters, were so incongruous in character as to be
incapable of acting together in a difficulty, and they had no
leader: added to this, the master of the vessel was utterly
worthless as a navigator. After many divided councils, it was
resolved to steer west, pass inside the Barrier Reef, and make
one of the North Queensland ports; and acting on this intention
they gained the inner waters safely. Instead of anchoring at
night and waiting for daylight to pick their way through the
labyrinth of reefs which surrounded them, they pressed recklessly
on, and struck on Bramble Reef, early in the morning of February
26th, about thirty miles east of Cardwell, and twenty from
Hinchinbrooke, on the south side of Rockingham Bay. Scarcely had
the luckless vessel fastened herself on the rocks, than the
master, whose incapacity had caused the disaster, basely deserted
the vessel before day broke, taking six men with him in the best
boat, which would have held twenty, pretending that he was going
for assistance.</p>
<p>The mate left in charge now became madly excited; the vessel
was filling rapidly, and but two boats remained, which were
incapable of holding a third of the company. Two rafts were
constructed, and barely launched, when the vessel heeled over,
slipped from the reef, and sank in deep water to her lower yards.
Thirteen men struggled on to the larger raft, twelve gained the
smaller, and some clung to the rigging; the rest were drowned,
with the exception of a few men in the second boat, who had gone
to pick up the third boat, which had broken adrift before the
sinking of the vessel. These boats returning, took some men off
the rigging, and leaving nine to perish there, made for the land
fifteen miles off.</p>
<p>The captain, not knowing his position, took his boat past
Cardwell, and landed at Tam o'Shanter's Point, at the north of
Buckingham Bay, where he was attacked by the natives, and met his
fate, being murdered, with three of his men. The other three,
though badly wounded, escaped, and hiding in the bush by day, and
creeping out at night (when the blacks fear to stir abroad),
reached Cardwell, forty miles distant, where the other boats also
arrived after five days' wandering.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheridan, on hearing their story, chartered a steamer
which happened to be lying in the bay, and sent her to the scene
of the wreck, from which she returned with a report that all on
the masts had perished, and that no rafts were to be seen.
Navigating-Midshipman Sabben, present in charge of the "Peri",
then left in a gig, with two men-of-war's men, and six shore
volunteers, all well armed, to recover the boat taken by the
natives from the murdered captain, and reached Tam o'Shanter's
Point at 4 <small>P.M</small>. on the 5th. On landing he found
the captured boat drawn up amongst the scrub, her masts stepped,
and preparation made to burn her. He hauled her into the water,
and his men began to cook some food, their first for twelve
hours. Suddenly there was a yell, and about 120 natives, making
hostile demonstrations, rushed from the mangrove bushes 300 yards
off the boat, and made for her; Mr. Sabben and his men ran also,
gained her first, and opened fire on the blacks at eighty yards,
who returned it with a volley of spears, and took to their heels
after a while, leaving eight dead and eight wounded behind them.
Mr. Sabben then left for Cardwell with his gig and the captain's
boat, and after pulling all night, had to beach the boats for a
couple of hours till a heavy sea and head wind had somewhat
subsided, when he went on, and landed his men at Cardwell at 8
<small>P.M</small>.</p>
<p>On our arrival, Mr. Sabben came and reported his execution of
this service to me, and Mr. Sheridan met me with a magisterial
requisition for assistance, rendered necessary by the fact that
various murders and acts of violence had been committed by the
blacks of late near Cardwell. It concluded in these
words&mdash;"If some immediate action is not taken, no boat will
be safe on the coast, and I am afraid that the settlers outside
the town, or even the town itself, may be attacked by the
savages." I therefore aided him to send his black troopers and
their officers to the scene of the latest murder&mdash;that of
the boat's crew of the "Maria" (there to inflict a decisive
punishment), by embarking them on board the "Peri",&mdash;sending
with them three officers and twelve men of H.M.S. "Basilisk",
under the command of Lieutenant Francis Hayter. It is needless to
say that I felt it very painful to take such a step, but in Mr.
Sheridan's opinion as well as my own it was necessary, not only
for the sake of justice, and in the interests of all white men
who might hereafter be placed at the mercy of the tribe, but to
secure the safety of Cardwell itself. The tribe was surprised
before daylight,&mdash;several unfortunate blacks were shot down
by the native troopers, who showed an unrestrained ferocity that
disgusted our officers; and the camp, in which some clothing and
effects of the four murdered men were found, was destroyed. This
work of justice over, the party returned to Cardwell, bringing
with them a little native lad about six years old, whose father
had been shot. The boy, afterwards christened John Peri, soon
became a great favourite on board the "Basilisk". He died in
England, where he had been sent for education by the kind act of
Mr. Hayter, three years afterwards, of disease of the lungs.</p>
<p>I had a hope that some survivors might even yet be found on
the rafts, so, directly on despatching Mr. Hayter and his party,
the "Basilisk" left again in search of the rafts. Calculating the
effect of the winds and prevailing currents, I concluded that the
rafts, unless stopped by some obstruction, would strike the
mainland sixty or seventy miles north of Cardwell. We therefore
steered at first to examine the banks and islets which lay in the
supposed line of their drift. Finding no traces, we stood in for
the Queensland coast, anchored off Cooper's Point, and sent our
boats north and south to examine the whole coast minutely.</p>
<p>After the boats had left, Mr. O'Neill, our paymaster, suddenly
called out, "I see white men on the beach!" and our glasses soon
confirmed the truth of his discovery. I stepped into a boat,
taking some food and wine, and pulled rapidly for the beach. As
we neared the beach we were rather alarmed by seeing that the
white men had disappeared, and that a number of blacks were
standing in their place, and our men gave way with a will that
sent the boat flying through the water. Just as we landed, the
white men rose into sight again, and we afterwards learned that
they had fallen on their knees behind a rock on seeing us, to
give thanks to the Almighty for their deliverance. Eight
emaciated half-naked creatures met us, and clasped our hands, and
told us that they only were left alive of the thirteen belonging
to the larger raft. There was no need to tell of the sufferings
they had gone through, their wasted, ulcerated bodies, and the
feeble voices with which they tried to raise a cheer, told
plainly that we had only saved them just in time. The wine we had
brought gave them a little strength, and they crawled along with
us to the native camp in order that I might see for myself how
well the natives had cared for them.</p>
<p>Many rocks cropped up through this sandy beach, and it was
bordered with scrub, behind which rose steep hills covered with
Australian firs, wild banana trees, and smaller vegetation. In
some places the bush was quite impenetrable, being composed of
various kinds of canes, some of a thorny nature, and vines and
creepers, some of which ran nearly to the top of the tallest
trees.</p>
<p>In a luxuriant glen, at the foot of these hills, after about
five minutes' walk from the beach, we came to the gunyahs or huts
of the blacks, standing in a cleared space, surrounded by
gigantic trees, a contrast indeed to the poor shelter of branches
with which their Cape York brethren content themselves. These
gunyahs, which were oval in shape, and about five feet high, and
eight or nine long at their greatest diameter, were made of rows
of long pliable canes, secured to the ground at one end, and bent
in a bow towards each other, and tied so as to form a succession
of arches, thatched over with palm leaves and the bark of trees.
One gunyah, which we were told was for the unmarried women, was
considerably larger, being fully seven feet high and fifteen feet
long at its greatest diameter. The floor was strewn with clean
rushes, and it had quite a comfortable appearance. In one or two
of the smaller gunyahs the shipwrecked men had been lodged, and
precariously fed with wild fruits, and small quantities of fish
by the kindly blacks, whose diminutive size and skeleton-like
appearance showed how hard a struggle they themselves had for
existence. Their weapons and fishing gear were of the rudest
kind, and consisted only of light spears tipped with hard wood
roughly pointed, shields, and huge unwieldy swords, about five
feet long and four inches broad, with a handle small out of all
proportion, being not more than three inches in length. For
fishing they had hooks made of hard wood, lines of twisted fibre,
and funnel-shaped baskets for catching shrimps. Having expressed
to these good-natured savages, as far as signs could go, my
gratitude for their humanity, and a promise of sending them a
present, the shipwrecked men and the blacks said good-bye to each
other in a manner more affecting than I had supposed possible.
The latter seemed to rejoice that the white men had found their
friends, whilst they grieved to part with them. They embraced
them, weeping bitterly at the water's edge, and remained on the
beach gazing after our receding boat. Immediately on reaching the
ship I sent the blacks a bag of biscuit and other presents. The
eight rescued men were soon clothed from our wardrobes, the
doctor attended to their sores and ulcers, and a hearty meal did
much to revive them. They told us that they had left the wreck on
the morning of February 26th, without a drop of fresh water, or a
particle of food on their ill-constructed raft, with only one
oar, and without a sail; a tent was afterwards converted into a
sail, but soon lost. For the first day the smaller raft kept
company, but after that they saw it no more. Their distance from
the mainland was about twenty miles, and the first day passed
tolerably well, as they were buoyed up by the hope of reaching
land, but during the night the wind and the sea rose, and they
lost sight of land, and grew disheartened, all but one or two
brave fellows who seem never to have despaired. The morning sun
of the 27th cheered them all for a time, but the weather became
worse; their make-shift sail and solitary oar were washed away,
and they drifted past some islands about five miles distant.
Despair now seized the majority, and two men became insane. The
second night closed on them in a miserable plight, the lashings
of the raft had become so loose that she continually rolled over
and over, throwing the occupants into the water, and when morning
broke it was found that the insane men and two others had been
drowned. The rest turned to manfully, and split some planks into
paddles, but could not reach the shore, along which they drifted
at a distance of about two miles; a third man now lost his senses
and died raving mad. A third night closed in on these
unfortunates, and a fourth man became insane; but two companions,
Foster and Coyle, the former son of an ex-prime minister of New
South Wales, kept up heart, and were the salvation of their
comrades. Some time after midnight the raft grounded on a sandy
beach, and its eight surviving occupants reached the shore, and
slept on the beach till daylight enabled them to look for food.
Strange to say, although from the time of their leaving the
"Maria", not a morsel of food or drop of water had passed their
lips, they did not feel hungry or thirsty. The system was
doubtless supplied with moisture through the pores of the skin,
as the men were immersed in water the whole time; but it is
difficult to account for the absence of hunger. They found some
wild fruits, which partly restored their strength, and coming to
the remains of a fire left by the natives, searched about,
thinking the blacks might have left something eatable, and Coyle
presently picked up the stem of some bulbous plant and bit it,
but instantly dropped it, gasping out "water". Foster hobbled off
to a small creek and brought him a shell full of water, with
which lie washed his mouth, but for about an hour he suffered
agony from an intense burning in the mouth, and could scarcely
speak for the rest of the day. They now met some natives, and
finding them kindly, kept with them to the end of the twelve
days, wandering with them up and down the coast, as they shifted
their quarters in search of food. Part of the food consisted of
ant eggs, which the natives bruised in water, and strained
through a porous basket into the hollow of a rock. The pulpy
matter was first eaten, and the water then drunk. It was white as
milk from the juice of the eggs, and had a pleasant acid flavour.
Having thus saved the survivors from the larger raft, I felt full
of hope that we should save some from the smaller; but it was not
so to be: the crew had already met its fate, and a sad one.</p>
<p>On the day that we rescued these men, Lieutenant Sydney Smith,
in charge of a cutter detached to explore the coast from the
point where the "Basilisk" had anchored to the southward, found
the remains of the small raft on the beach, not more than six
miles from the spot where the larger had struck, but separated by
a good-sized navigable river, which had prevented
(providentially, as it appeared) any communication between their
respective crews. Shortly after passing this fine stream, which
we afterwards examined and named "Gladys' River", Mr. Smith found
the bodies of two white men, one as if asleep, in an attitude of
peaceful repose, with the head resting on a folded coat, and the
other lying on the edge of the surf. In the pocket of one a
lady's embroidered handkerchief was found, and near these bodies
were the remains of the raft. Two more days were devoted to
careful search along the coast for many miles, but no traces of
living men could be found. A few miles to the southward the naked
body of one of the castaways was found. He was but a few hours
dead, and had evidently been murdered by the natives, the skull
being beaten in. Still further search, afterwards made by
Navigating-Lieutenant Gowland, of the New South Wales steamer
"Governor Blackall", discovered six more bodies farther to the
south, which showed that those who had landed from the smaller
raft had endeavoured to reach Cardwell by walking along the
beach, but, meeting hostile natives, had been murdered.</p>
<p>Thus ended this unfortunate attempt to reach New Guinea; an
attempt which is but one proof, out of many, that Australian
instinct points to the possession of this great island. Many
attempts to establish a footing in New Guinea may fail, but the
instinct is a true one, founded on natural facts and needs, which
time will prove to be imperative.</p>
<p>During this search for the shipwrecked men we were fortunate
enough to bring to light a harbour on the Queensland coast, only
60 miles north of Cardwell, the existence of which had been
previously merely guessed at. Navigating-Lieutenant Mourilyan and
I, passing in the galley between two headlands but 120 yards
apart, were hardly able to believe our eyes, when we saw a
land-locked sheet of water spread before us, apparently capable
of holding hundreds of vessels, with a river falling into it.
Further examination proved that the greater part of this harbour
is too shoal for anything larger than boats, but that there is
sufficient deep water for several large ships to moor in safety.
The mud banks which encumber the rest of the harbour seem easy of
removal by dredging, as space may be required. The want of any
secure harbours on the Queensland coast rendered this discovery
important, and had it been made before, this position would
doubtless have been chosen as the site of the settlement made at
Cardwell. The country inland of Mourilyan Harbour, as we named
it, has since been surveyed by G. Elphinstone Dalrymple, Esq.,
who says that it is a magnificent scrub-land, fit for the growth
of sugar; that the extent of the available sugar land may be
roughly estimated as between 300,000 and 400,000 acres, and that
this fine tract of country is tapped by the river which falls
into this harbour.</p>
<p>Mourilyan Harbour (as we named it), is thus one day likely to
become the seat of a prosperous community. At the south head of
the harbour, Moresby River empties itself. It is a stream of good
width, nearly as large as the Brisbane River below Brisbane, with
7 feet of water over the bar at half flood, and carries a depth
of 8 to 12 feet for about 14 miles above the harbour. It flows
sluggishly between low banks, which are covered with mangroves,
but open out eventually into the rich scrub-land described. The
soil on the hills which surround the new harbour is declared to
be very rich, and suitable for the growth of coffee and
nutmegs.</p>
<p>We returned to Cardwell on March 15, and the steamer "Governor
Blackall", sent by the New South Wales Government to search for
the survivors of the "Maria" arriving, the rescued men went on
board her, and the "Basilisk", taking the "Peri" prize, with the
kidnapped islanders on board, in tow, sailed for Sydney on the
17th March.</p>
<p>At the Percy Islands&mdash;uninhabited wooded islets some 40
miles from the Queensland coast&mdash;we stopped to water, on our
way down. The anchorage was bad; and the water, at the time of
our visit, ran but slowly over a rocky ledge. With hammer and
chisel we cut the rock, so as to let all the water fall into the
mouth of the watering hose, but only succeeded in getting six
tons in twelve hours. On the largest of the Percy Islets the sea
has broken through the outside rocks and formed a land-locked
basin, which yielded a plentiful supply of fish to our seining
party.</p>
<p>On March 22d we reached Keppel's Bay, where a small supply of
coal was waiting us, and whilst taking this on board visited the
rising town of Rockingham, 40 miles up the Fitzroy River, which
is a fine stream, but has a sluggish current At Rockingham we
were fortunate enough to meet the ladies of the neighbourhood at
a ball held for a local charity, the sight of whom was refreshing
indeed to eyes fresh from savagedom.</p>
<p>March 27th saw us once more at anchor in Moreton Bay, where we
were received with much kindness by the governor and Mr. Palmer,
who complimented us on the services they considered us to have
rendered the colony. The "Peri" being now within the jurisdiction
of the Brisbane prize court, Lord Normanby and the ministers
wished to take legal possession of her; but on the plea that
evidence had been produced to show that she might belong to the
Fijian Government, they allowed us to take her to Sydney. We
reached Sydney on April the 6th, and there an owner for the
"Peri" came forward and proved his claim, and the vessel, lately
the scene of such a terrible tragedy, was handed over to him. The
natives were shipped on board H.M.S. "Cossack", and returned to
their own islands, in the Solomon group.</p>
<p>On our way to Sydney we called at Newcastle, 80 miles north,
to replenish our coal cheaply, by getting it direct from the
mines, and whilst there I visited the extensive coal mines which
lie 10 miles from the port. The extent and value of these great
coalfields cannot yet be calculated, the greatest depth reached
being only 300 feet. It is a singular fact that all the fossil
remains, and impressions of wood and foliage found embedded in
the coal-strata of Australia, are the same precisely as those
which now exist in life, and that no trace is to be found of an
extinct fauna and flora.</p>

<p><small>THE</small> increasing atrocities connected with the
labour traffic amongst the South Sea Islands had at this time
drawn universal attention, and it was felt that the English flag
must no longer be disgraced by barbarities, too often wrought
under its shelter, in procuring the natives. The system of
enforced labour, which followed their capture, was also seen to
be a form of slavery, and, as such, not only inconsistent with
all human rights, but capable of having its normal evils
exaggerated to the last extreme by circumstances of isolation,
distance from law and authority, want of organisation, ignorance,
brutality, or incapacity in the overseers. Efforts had been made
by various commanders of H.M. ships to bring matters to a crisis
by capturing vessels against which the most flagrant cases could
be proved, and running the risk of a legal trial at Sydney. Some
such cases were brought before the humane Chief-Justice of New
South Wales, Sir Alfred Stephen, but he was obliged to rule that,
as the law then stood, the only acts under which they could be
tried, were those existing against piracy and slavery, and that
the plaintiffs not being able to deny that the unfortunate
islanders had received or been promised some compensation for
their work, and that their period of service was ostensibly
limited by time, had failed to establish a charge. To meet this
evil the Kidnapping Act of 1872 was passed, and under its
provisions the crime may be said to have virtually ceased, though
isolated instances may even yet occasionally occur. At this time
the Act was not in force, and when, in May 1872, H.M.S.
"Basilisk" sailed under orders to visit many groups of the South
Sea Islands and check kidnapping, she went, like her
predecessors, to work with eyes open but hands tied. There were
many possibilities, however, of our performing good service in
the cruise, besides that of capturing kidnappers. Hydrographical
knowledge might be somewhat increased; islands, as yet unvisited,
might be explored, and found to offer inviting homes to fresh
swarms from the English hive; the pleasure of the prospect, a
sight of the loveliest islands of the Pacific, was undoubted, and
stirred the most apathetic amongst us. Having taken on board a
deck load of coal and provisions, and provided ourselves with
beads, knives, and other trifles for presents or barter with the
islanders, we left Sydney on May 14th, and steered for Lord
Howe's Island, about 400 miles east of Sydney, uninhabited except
by a few people, who live on garden produce, and supply passing
whalers. A heavy gale, however, blew us to leeward, and when it
abated, I considered it unwise to expend coal at the beginning of
our long cruise in an attempt to reach the island under steam.
The gale had also shattered us aloft, leaving our foreyard and
foretop sail-yard hanging each in two pieces. This accident had
been caused by the ship being taken suddenly aback in the night,
when the officer of the watch was knocked senseless by a blow on
the head from the trysail-sheet block at the critical moment, and
about three minutes elapsed before the necessary orders could be
given, in which time the mischief was done. Through the heavy
wind and rain, in pitch darkness, illumined constantly by
blinding lightning, Mr. Mudge, our gallant boatswain, led a party
of seamen in the difficult task of getting down and securing the
great broken spars which swayed heavily from side to side with
the violent motion of the ship. Our chief engineer, Mr. Slade,
aided us much afterwards in repairing the broken foreyard. Wooden
fishes were rejected, and the spare iron radius bars of the
paddle-wheels used instead, and bolted through the yard to each
other&mdash;a ship-shape, neat piece of work being made, that we
were all proud of, whilst the yard was stronger than ever. On the
third day after the mishap we were once more a-taunto, and on May
26th reached Norfolk Island, the home of the descendants of the
mutineers of the "Bounty", and anchored on the north side of the
island, in Cascade Bay. We were known by the islanders to be the
"Basilisk", and my father's name being dear to the inhabitants,
they gathered in nearly their full numbers at Cascade landing,
and gave us a hearty and affectionate welcome that was
appreciated by us all. Shaggy ponies were provided, and we
climbed the steep hill by a rough bridle-path to the summit, when
a ride of about three miles through a rich, open, undulating
country, dotted with herds of well bred cattle, brought us within
view of the settlement on the opposite side of the island. Here
we found the venerable, but still hale and active pastor of the
island, the Rev. G.H. Nobbs, awaiting us; and whilst the officers
and men were eagerly taken possession of by various inhabitants,
I became his guest.</p>
<p>So much has been written of Norfolk Island since it exchanged
its convicts for the most gentle and well-reported of
Anglo-Polynesian race existing, that I will not add to it here.
The briefest stay amongst the Norfolk Islanders convinces one
that the passive virtues abound amongst them, but that a
development of mental muscle is needed to make them
systematically energetic, industrious, and persevering.</p>
<p>The following day I went to the Milanesian Mission College,
three miles distant, to gain information from the Rev.
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Coddrington respecting kidnapping amongst
the many islands visited by him in the course of his duty. At
this Mission College youths from all parts of Milanesia are
trained to become missionary teachers; and many of them being
very intelligent, it occurred to me that I might gain some
knowledge from them and the missionary clergy, which would be
useful in our island cruise.</p>
<p>I slept that night in the room but lately occupied by the
martyred Bishop Pattison, surrounded by many books&mdash;the only
luxury he appeared to have allowed himself; for the small iron
bedstead and scanty furniture were in keeping with the simple
habits of his life. At first the place seemed so pervaded with
his presence that it felt like a profanation to sleep there, but
after a while I remembered that we were just about to try and
avenge him in the way he would best have loved, by putting down
the kidnapping which had caused his death, wherever we could hunt
it out.</p>
<p>The harmonious singing, and devout manner of the native youths
in the chapel, struck me very much. I gained considerable
information from them&mdash;some of it sad and startling indeed.
One lad from the Solomon group told me, with truth in his face,
that he had seen his own brother's head cut off by white men
belonging to a schooner which ran down his canoe. Another, a
Christian native of Florida, one of the Solomon Isles, had seen
five islanders beheaded by the crew of a brig. The heads of the
murdered men were doubtless to be used in bartering for slaves or
sandal-wood, with chiefs who rate their greatness by the number
of skulls they possess.</p>
<p>It is difficult to believe that such atrocities were
common&mdash;but the evidence compels belief. I made an early
start to return on board next morning, but so heavy a sea was
rolling in at the landing-place that it was impossible to embark.
A fierce gale sprang up; and the ship, now mounted on a great
wave, now lost to sight in a trough of the sea, had to put out
for safety, and leave us all behind. The gale did not abate till
the third day, and the sixth day arrived before the "Basilisk"
was again able to make the island. But for our anxiety for the
ship, no time could have been spent more enjoy ably than was
this, in riding, and walking with the kindly islanders, and
joining in their evening amusements at the public room; and we
found one useful piece of work to put our hands to. Wishing to
set an example of industry, as well as meet the islanders in good
fellowship, I pointed out to the chief magistrate and Mr. Nobbs,
that the flagstaff on the hill, blown down some time since, by
which alone clear communication could be held with passing ships,
ought to be replaced; and having their consent, I got a party of
islanders to go with Mr. Maben, our carpenter, to the bush, where
a straight tall pine about 70 feet high was selected and felled,
which was then brought by sheer strength to the signal hill. Our
seamen, with Mr. Mudge, prepared the rigging, and the islanders
dug a deep hole, and by our united efforts, after three days'
work with very imperfect tools, the flagstaff was made, and
erected.</p>
<p>June 1st, the "Basilisk" having returned, we bade a regretful
adieu to the Norfolk Islanders, who for six days had entertained
us hospitably, putting all they had at our service, with a
kindliness and simplicity that we shall never forget.</p>
<p>Good wishes and presents were exchanged, and then with a
favouring breeze we went on our way.</p>
<p>The ship had suffered somewhat in the heavy gale that had
driven her to sea; had lost an anchor and chain, and one man had
broken his arm, and another his collar-bone by a severe fall.
Indeed the gale was described by those on board as something
terrific.</p>
<p>After a tedious passage we sighted Keppel and Boscawen Islands
on June 21st, but it was dark before we could close the land, so
we tacked and stood off for the night. Next morning we ran
between the two islands, hove to about a mile from the reef which
surrounds Keppel, and feasted our eyes on the green paradise
which rose from the still blue water before us, two wooded peaks
rising abruptly from a rich flat, 400 feet, into air as blue and
still; a white coral beach glistening below; and little native
huts peeping out like birds' nests from between the trees. Keppel
Island is but some four miles long by two and a half broad; but
being of coral and volcanic origin combined, it has variety, and
the beauties belonging to both origins; the bold volcanic
heights, and the coraline bright beach and verdant flat. On
strictly coral islets you see no trees but cocoa-nut,
bread-fruit, and small palms; but here they were mixed with
forest trees, as on volcanic soils, and the light greens thus
broken up with deeper tints.</p>
<p>Visitors have spoken in such enchanting terms of these coral
and volcanic isles, that we were prepared to be disappointed. I
can only say that some of these emerald gems, shrined in by the
summer sea, with sparkling beach, leafy shades, and a
wealth&mdash;a waste of fruit and flower, seemed to me like
scenes in a dream of peace and beauty. We landed at once, to make
the acquaintance of the islanders, and see if, in appearance at
least, they were worthy inhabitants of their Eden; fully armed,
for we knew nothing of their disposition&mdash;the latest account
of the island dating from 1832. Judge then of our pleasure when
we saw a group of fishers on a reef, young men and women, break
up, and after some talking and pointing, move towards us, instead
of flying. We beckoned, and the young folk came running, and
clustered round us, without a sign of fear&mdash;shaking our
hands, and uttering sounds of welcome. I must confess that we
English seemed to grow suddenly shorter and more thick-set as we
stood amongst them; but what wonder! Some of these men, lithe and
strong as Apollo, with short curled lip, and keen eye, were
models for a sculptor. The colour of these fine people is not
unpleasing; a clear brown, with a slight copper tint; indeed it
became agreeable to us after a time, by contrast with our own
sun-dyed faces. Their stature, even that of the women, is far
above the average, and their limbs are so symmetrical as to give
an idea of undeteriorated physical perfection. The noble head is
well set on the slender throat, over a massive shoulder, and
every movement of the body, from the turn of the head to the
poise of the shapely foot, is full of grace and strength. Our new
friends wore the "Ti-ti", a short grass petticoat, ornamented
with long feathers, and bright ribbons of sea-weed, and a few
white shells, which set off their forms to advantage. The skin of
the girls was soft as satin from the constant use of cocoa-nut
oil, and their dark eyes were full of expression, as they smiled,
perhaps with lips a little too full for the strict idea of
beauty, at our attempts to make them understand.</p>
<p>We soon discovered that one of the men could speak a little
English, and began to talk; and this native presently undertook
to pilot our boat into the lagoon. He took us two miles along the
reef to a very narrow opening, and we shot between high coral
walls over a translucent depth of nine or ten fathoms, through
which you could see the coral glimmer below, into the lagoon, a
lake of quiet blue water, backed by a dazzling white beach, on
which cocoa-nut trees and rich greenery came crowding down. We
landed, and took a short path, through grateful shade, to the
village, accompanied by our fisher friends, who told us that they
were all Christians, and that a missionary, a native of Tonga,
lives on the island and instructs them. The village lies in a
grove of cocoa-nut, bread-fruit, and shady trees, amongst which
its pretty elliptical houses nestle at irregular distances. The
church stands in an open space, a building 130 feet long, 30
wide, and 35 high. The frame is supported by immense uprights of
the bread-fruit tree, the roof is high-pitched and thatched, the
sides are covered with cocoa matting, spaces being left for
windows, and both ends are quite open. All the houses are
similarly built, on a small scale. The church was beautifully
clean, as were all the houses, and tastefully decorated with
shells. We spoke to a German, the solitary white man living on
the island, and he told me that the kidnappers had once attempted
to cozen these people, but found them too enlightened to be
trapped. In every house that we entered fresh clean mats were
spread for us, and we were offered bananas, mammy apples, and
fresh cocoa-nut milk; and all was done with a natural politeness
that charmed us. We stood away for Niua or Good Hope Island that
evening, bearing with us pleasant thoughts of the nut-brown
maidens of Keppel's isle.</p>
<p>Sunday night brought heavy rain and squalls, which kept us on
the alert nearly all night, but Monday broke fine, and we ran
down under sail to Niua, an island in lat. 16&deg; 5', and
176&deg; W. We were seen at once, and some canoes, well carved
and polished, came off. The natives hesitated at first, but
finally some came on board, and I took one as a pilot and started
for shore, followed by two boats containing a number of our
officers and men. Niua is a purely volcanic island, rising steep
and wooded from the surf, and fronted us with a rampart of black
lava cliffs that seemed to forbid our landing. Our pilot pointed
to a place where a mighty stream of lava had run out 200 yards
into the sea, and cooled down, and our boats went in and lay
under the lee of this natural breakwater in safety; but a rougher
landing-place I never saw, and we had to continue a tiring
scramble over broken masses of lava that strewed the ground at
every step, until we got well up into the bush, where it had
become pulverised and mixed with vegetable matter. There it was
pleasant walking enough, but our shoes had by this time been cut
to pieces. The island is about six miles long by three in
breadth, and seems from its shape and the deep soundings about it
to be the summit of a buried volcanic mountain.</p>
<p>Fire and lava break from various parts of the surface within
every period of two years. The last outburst came up through a
house; the owner, who barely escaped with terrible burns, having
had no warning. The soil is so scanty and the lava rock so hard
that the people are obliged to raise the surface of their
burial-places artificially, and no fresh water, save rain, can be
obtained; but the island is luxuriantly productive; and the
inhabitants need never fear a drought, for they are supplied with
milk by millions of cocoa-nuts, the most delicious of all drinks
when fresh. The most singular natural feature in the island is a
lake about six miles in circumference, which lies in a bed formed
by a vast extinct crater, between picturesque, wooded, hilly
shores, and bears on its bosom three lovely islets, covered with
ferns, palms, and rich vegetation. As I stood looking down from a
height of 400 or 500 feet, Niua itself seemed but a speck of
green afloat on a world of waters, and the lake a morsel of
silver dropped in its centre.</p>
<p>The water is brackish, for the sea percolates through the
narrow neck of land which encloses the lake on one side; but
there is a spring on one of the islets, which, though brackish,
is drinkable. Niua forms part of King George of Tonga's dominions
(the Friendly Isles), and is Christianised; but the habits and
manners of the people, who do not seem so fine a race as the
Keppel islanders, are still aboriginal. A walk of four miles
through a shady tropical forest brought us to the village, where
the chief, an intelligent-looking grey-headed man, barefooted,
but dressed in a black coat, bought in one of his annual visits
to Tonga, received me with great respect, in a space overhung by
the huge projecting eaves of his "Talking-House". Some hundreds
of natives were assembled to do us honour, and sat in a
semicircle on the grass, in a clearing in front of us, preserving
perfect silence. It was a pretty sight to see the rows of
islanders dressed in the picturesque "Ti-ti", over which the
girls had thrown scarfs of white tappa, seated on the emerald
grass, with a belt of sunny trees behind. Oval huts lay snugly
nestling all round, amongst the bread-fruit trees that grew in
great masses of shade on the rich flat, broken to the south by
blue glimpses of the sea; on the north a wooded and cultivated
hill shut in all. The chief gave us a grand banquet in South Sea
Island fashion, under the eaves of his reception or talking-room,
consisting of roast pig, bread-fruit, and an enormous land
crab&mdash;which land crab is a dish for a gourmand. It feeds
only on the nuts which fall from the cocoa-nut tree, the hardest
of which it cracks with ease, and thus acquires a delicious
flavour. No spirit of any kind is allowed on the island; but the
milk of the fresh cracked cocoa-nuts was perfect nectar to us
thirsty folk. I strolled about the village after the feast, and
entering the church, was much touched by visible signs of the
reverence with which these simple people worship the Creator.
Indeed, the feeling of reverence comes over the mind as
powerfully in one of these little island churches as in any
cathedral at home. There is, of course, no thought of bygone
saintliness and valour, as at home, where time-stained marble and
tattered colour witness mutely from the walls, and appeal to all
that is good in us; and this want is felt by the visitor as in
all young countries; but his mind turns to the future, and that
is full of hope. Whilst on the island we gained some valuable
information relative to kidnapping from a German, here as at
Keppel, the only white man resident. Thirty men had been
kidnapped from Niua five years before our visit, not one of whom
had since been heard of; and a near island, one of the Union
group, which had contained a population of fifty or sixty souls,
had been depopulated by one act. The master of a barque, under
Spanish colours, had decoyed all its inhabitants on board, under
pretence of teaching and making missionaries of them, and had
secured and sailed away with them.</p>

<small>MAP OF UEA ISLAND, OR WALLIS ISLAND</small></p>
<br>
<p>The wind was north-west, in the heart of the south-east trade,
when we left Niua on the 26th, and we had not coal enough to
steam, but coaxing the old "Basilisk" to make the most of the
light variable winds, we sighted Wallis Island in the middle
watch of the night of the 28th. We stood on till eight
<small>A.M</small>. and then hove-to, about a mile off its
surrounding reef, where we were boarded by a native pilot, a
splendid-looking old man. I do not know of any instance in which
a reef surrounds an island more completely than here. A ring of
water from two to four miles wide is perfectly inclosed between
Wallis and its reef. We might have taken the ship through the
entrance, and anchored within, but were content to land in the
boats, in which we shot at once from the deep heave of the ocean
to the stillness of a sleeping lake, whose broad expanse is
dotted over with tree-covered islets, some of which are very
lovely. The island, which is of coral-volcanic formation, is
about nine miles in length, of an irregular shape, and rises to a
height of 700 or 800 feet. It has a population of about 3800
souls. The landing-place is on the south-east side of the island,
and here we were met by the French priest in charge of the Roman
Catholic mission, a kindly, well-informed man, who seemed very
proud of his large stone-built church, which, he told us, had
taken ten years to build. We visited the church, and found it
filled with gaudy religious pictures. The priest told us that for
many years the island had been the scene of fierce religious wars
between the Protestant and Roman Catholic natives, till the
former were defeated, on which the latter faith was
established.</p>
<p>The natives differ from the light-coloured Polynesians of
Keppel and Good Hope Islands, and incline more to the dark
Milanesian type. Their huts were small, and not clean; and the
women seemed careless of their appearance. Wallis Island, lying
only 400 miles north of the Fiji group, possessing secure
anchorage for ships, and abundant supplies of fruit and
vegetables, should, I think, be taken into our new Fijian colony,
on the ground that every colony, if possible, should be put in a
position to develope and protect its own future. In the hands of
an enemy at war, it would offer a strategic position of great
value, to be used in operations against Fiji.</p>
<p>The priest told us that no kidnapping had taken place at
Wallis Island, though several labour vessels had attempted
it.</p>
<p>Fotuna, forty miles south of Wallis Island, consists of two
rugged and precipitous islands, of coral-volcanic origin, of
which the central peak is 2000 feet high. They are broken up into
yawning fissures and perpendicular rocks, so that there seems no
room for cultivation except on the south shore, where the coral
asserts itself, and some level ground is found. Little cultivated
ravines also run up between the spurs of the hills; and from the
top of the highest peak to the edge of high-water mark, one dense
growth of tropical vegetation prevails. The larger island is
seven by five miles in extent, and has a population of about 1300
people, governed by two kings; the smaller is only about two
miles by one in extent, and not permanently inhabited. We hove-to
off the principal village, from which some canoes came off, and,
picking out a pilot from one of them, I pushed off in the galley
for shore, followed by Lieutenant Hayter, Dr. Haines, and other
officers, in two boats. On nearing, we found that a flat coral
rock ran out a long distance from the beach, with so heavy a surf
breaking on it as to prevent the approach of boats. I therefore
sent the two boats back to the ship, left the galley outside the
reef, and stepped into a canoe. My native rowers watched for the
intervals of smooth water between the breakers, then paddled with
great rapidity, and beached her safely, and I was soon surrounded
by a crowd of gesticulating, noisy natives. Lieutenant Hayter,
fearing lest evil should befall me, came hurriedly on shore,
followed by other officers, but we soon saw that the crowding was
only the result of curiosity and excitement. We walked for about
two miles through a succession of villages, scattered amongst
groves of bread-fruit trees, and, passing by the little Roman
Catholic church, ascended by steps cut in the rock, to a high
coral plateau, once the site of a native fort, where the priest
has his dwelling. Here the king met us, nowise to be
distinguished from one of his subjects, but evidently fully
recognised by his people. As we conversed with him, by the help
of the priest, a bowl of ava was prepared for our drinking, in
the following way:&mdash;Some young men brought the ava, a
species of root, dried in the sun, and the ava bowl, very
capacious, and beautifully clean, and then sat down in two rows,
and biting off large pieces of the ava, chewed it till their
mouths were full of pulp, which was thrown into the bowl, and
water added, the whole was stirred up, and then passed through a
strainer of vegetable fibre, and this done, one of the young men
stood up, and pronounced in a loud tone, "The ava is ready!" This
announcement was followed by the salute of a loud clapping of
hands from all the natives present. A cup-bearer and a
talking-man then came forward; the former filled a cocoa-nut
shell with the liquor, and the young men asked in a kind of song,
"Who is this for?" "The king!" replied the talking-man; on which
his majesty received, and quaffed off the cup, amid much
cheering. The cup was again replenished, and, "Who is this for?"
asked, and I was named. I had foreseen that Fate had this honour
in store for me, and with no small effort had made up my mind to
taste the ava. The flavour was more like that of a mild mixture
of rhubarb and magnesia than anything else; but two or three of
our young officers drank a draught right off, and the French
priest seemed quite to enjoy it. The ava acts on the system
somewhat similarly to opium, and is doubtless valued for this
soothing property. Having ascertained that no kidnapping has
taken place here, also that many of the islanders ship on board
passing whalers, and never return, we took leave, with
expressions of friendship on both sides, in token of which I was
presented with some beautiful tappa cloth. At the beach the surf
had so much increased that it was only by the influence of the
king that we could get a canoe to take us off to our boats, which
lay outside. Dr. Haines and I waited till the last trip, and then
tried our luck, but hit the surf at a bad time, and were swamped,
and rolled over and over in a second. Alas for my tappa, and our
new-laced coats! After bailing out, and putting things to rights,
we tried again, and failed, till our rowers, finding the canoe
filling, jumped overboard, and, with a skill and strength
perfectly marvellous, towed and guided us through the boiling
surf&mdash;the doctor and I paddling for our lives all the
time.</p>
<p>The trade-wind visited us at last; with a flowing sheet we
sailed that evening for Rotumah, 300 miles to the west, and on
Wednesday the 3d sighted it. We did not possess any chart or plan
of this island; but a good anchorage was reported, and we met a
native coming out in his canoe, who showed it us, under the lee
of a coral reef, and near two small islets. Rotumah is fertile,
but the inhabited and cultivated part is only a narrow fringe
bordering on the sea-shore The interior, as with many of these
South Sea Islands, being a mass of dark dank tropical jungle,
with no path or track through it.</p>
<p>Whilst our men were watering, I gained information from the
missionary, Mr. Osborne, a fine manly Englishman, and found that,
thanks to the missionaries, Rotumah has not suffered from
kidnappers. The Rotumah men, who belong to the light-coloured
Polynesian race, have such a reputation for ability as boatmen
and seamen that they have been hired at high wages by the masters
of the kidnapping vessels to aid them in capturing the South Sea
Islanders, and some fifteen have been killed at various times by
the poisoned arrows of the natives they were seeking to capture,
which served them right. The people of Rotumah are taught by
English Protestant and French Roman Catholic missionaries, of
whom the former has by far the larger flock: the two parties have
agreed to differ in a peaceable manner. I visited Mr. Osborne,
the English missionary, and found his neat house and schools for
native children all that could be desired.</p>
<p>Hearing that some vessels were anchored in a bay six or seven
miles distant, Mr. Mourilyan and I went over in the galley, and
found that one of the vessels was a labour vessel, just come down
from the Line Islands, where she had been boarded by Captain
Moore, of H.M.S. "Barossa". Her papers were all right, so I was
compelled to pass her, as he had been. The others were legitimate
traders.</p>

<p><small>ON</small> the night of July 30th our course lay close
to the position assigned by some navigators to a cluster of
islands south of the Ellice group, named "Mitchell's group"; of
which others denied the existence; whilst the chart was doubtful.
I had been assured by several old traders in these parts that
there were no such islands, but thought it prudent to give the
order "leadsmen in the chains, and a bright look-out to be kept
for breakers", before I turned in at midnight. At two o'clock in
the morning the officer of the watch reported "land on starboard
bow". We hove-to, and at daylight our eyes rested on Mitchell's
group, real enough, and on a crowd of canoes coming off to look
at us. Getting a pilot, we went away with the boats as usual to
communicate, but there was no passage for them over the reef, so
Mr. Mourilyan and I betook ourselves to canoes, the most slender
beautiful things we had ever floated in. My rowers, as
good-humoured as possible, smiled, and showed their white teeth
as they paddled with much judgment, and landed me without a
wetting; but my poor companion was capsized and had a roll in the
surf, from which he soon re-appeared in a dripping state on the
bottom of the boat, much to my relief, though there is no real
danger in these upsets, for the natives of all the South Sea
Islands are perfectly amphibious, and consider it a point of
honour to save you. In my experience they are as much pleased by
your frank trust in their skill as Englishmen would be.</p>
<p>The Mitchell group consists of a cluster of about ten islets,
situated on a coral reef, which surrounds a shoal lagoon,
extending about five miles north and south, and two east and
west. The principal village, and the best landing-place, are on
the W.S.W. side of the cluster, and may be known by a neat white
church built of coral rock, which, when almost off the islet, may
be seen through the trees. The natives belong to the
light-coloured Polynesian race, but are somewhat darker than the
Keppel islanders, and number seventy.</p>
<p>We landed at the principal island, and found the people
strikingly clean in appearance and quiet in manner. They have
been Christianised by the efforts of a native Samoan missionary,
who found them easy docile converts. From a German, and a native
who could speak broken English, we learned a sad story. These
harmless people had numbered 450 souls in 1857, all living in
peace and plenty. In 1864, the German was absent for a short time
at Samoa, and on his return he found but fifty worn-out people
and children remaining&mdash;the rest had all been swept away by
kidnappers. Three large barques, under Spanish colours, had
appeared off the islands, from which an old man had landed, who
told the natives that they were missionary ships, and invited
them on board to receive the holy sacrament. All the able-bodied
men went on board in simple faith, and were immediately made
prisoners; again the old fiend went on shore and told the
assembled women and children that the men had sent for them, and
they were also beguiled. The tragedy thus complete, the ships
bore away, it was supposed for the guano islands of Peru; and not
a word has ever reached the islands as to the fate of these lost
ones from that day. It was sickening to hear the tale told on the
spot which had seen all this sorrow. Two of the men, one of whom
we saw, had contrived to jump overboard, and swim six or seven
miles back to the island.</p>
<p>The whole surface of these flat coral islets is like the clean
white-sanded floor of an old English kitchen. The cocoa-nut tree
springs up everywhere, but in the spots where yams and taro are
grown the sand is hollowed out, and a pit formed, from one to two
hundred yards long, and of varying width, into which decaying
cocoa-nut leaves and refuse are thrown, till a rich soil is
formed. I was much interested in these people; they are
prepossessing and kindly, and their houses, mats, and persons,
are pleasingly neat. The church is a little gem, built of coral
stone, and by their own labour. Fine specimens of the operculum
(the stony lid by which the South Sea Island whelk closes the
aperture of its shell) are found on the reefs here, and, when
polished and set, make handsome bracelets for ladies.</p>
<p>The Ellice group consists of a large number of tiny islets,
scattered between 5 and 10 degrees south latitude, and 175 and
180 east longitude, and is but little known, having only been
seen by passing vessels till quite recently. English Protestant
missionaries have established themselves on most of the islands,
and the German oil traders have a white agent stationed on nearly
every one to collect cocoa-nuts and cocoa-nut oil, against the
periodical visits of the small schooners, which take them to
Samoa for shipment to Germany. All the islets of this group are
of coral formation, and are so low as scarcely to be raised ten
feet above the sea level, but are covered with cocoa-nut and
bread-fruit trees.</p>
<p>All day long, on the 14th, we were trying to find an inhabited
island in the Ellice cluster, from which all the scattered Ellice
group takes its name. I landed at one village, and found it a
deserted village indeed&mdash;many houses, many graves, but no
inhabitants, save the tenants of the graves. It was depressing to
miss the life and sound that met us everywhere else on our
arrival; it is always saddening to see the ownership yielded back
to nature, and ruin creeping over a spot that has once been warm
with the affections of human life. We feared that kidnappers had
been here, but knew there was a chance that the villagers might
have migrated for better fishing.</p>
<p>During the night a current swept us twenty miles away from the
islands. We regained our position next day, and saw a canoe
paddling out, from which we learned that the only inhabited islet
of the Ellice cluster lay nine or ten miles dead to windward.
There was nothing for it but to row this distance in the
galley&mdash;a heavy pull against a fresh breeze. We rowed our
best, officers and men, but it was nine in the evening before we
reached the village. Once inside the usual inclosing reef, we saw
the full size of the lagoon it shelters&mdash;a lake some
eighteen miles long by nine wide, which is a most unusual size.
Bright white moonlight steeped the shore as we landed, making
visible every leaf and frond of the trees and undergrowth that
fringed it. The pure white coral surface shone like silver in the
opens, flecked with soft shadows from the trees, and across it a
warm yellow glow came from the cocoa-nut oil burning in the
pretty oval huts. Here was life at last, and that was cheering;
and then what loveliness!</p>
<p>I paused for a moment to look at the mingling of the two
lights. It gave the sort of radiance that Corregio has in his
"Notte", where the cold clear light of morning comes stealing
through the doorway from the eastern hills, and flows over the
yellow lambent flame, thrown upward from the body of the infant
Christ to the faces of his adorers. The little huts are open on
all sides, and the dusky forms of their owners soon began to
emerge like shadows. It was like a scene in a dream&mdash;the
sheet of moonlight, the graceful trees, the perfect stillness,
the roar of the surf, like a silence, it was so
measured&mdash;all seemed unreal, and ready to dissolve.</p>
<p>The island is about seven miles in length, and only a hundred
yards wide at its greatest breadth, so that the whole air is
always full of the thunder of the surf to windward. The natives
greeted us kindly, and we went up to the house of the only
resident white man. As we talked with him, nearly all the people
of the island crowded round outside, but they behaved with good
taste, and did not even speak aloud. They are Christians, taught
by a native missionary, and number only 140 souls now, more than
half the original population having been carried off by
kidnappers. The lonely white man we found here was making a
living by trading in cocoa-nut oil, supplied him by the natives,
and appeared quite happy.</p>
<p>The wind, which had been against us, was fair for our return,
a welcome help; and we reached the ship at midnight, and
immediately bore away for the cluster of coral islets named
Nukufuti, or De Peyser's Isles&mdash;also comprehended in the
Ellice group. We learned that the island containing the graves
was used as a cemetery, and only resorted to at certain seasons
for fishing and the gathering of cocoa-nuts. Myriads of cocoa-nut
plants covered these islets, in all stages of growth. Some, just
bursting the shell, were shooting forth slender fern-like leaves;
others, more advanced, were sending their small roots downwards
through the shell to find the soil&mdash;the shell still
containing moisture needful for the growth of the young tree.
Older plants had discarded the shell, and were throwing a clump
of graceful leaves upward, to the height of a man, but showing no
sign of a stem as yet; and from this they ranged up to the
full-sized tree. A description of one of these South Sea Islands
will nearly serve for all. At Nukufuti we found the usual
circular coral reef, with islets scattered along its inner edge,
which were densely covered with cocoa-nut trees. A ship channel
leads through this reef, and a brig lay within at this time,
bound for Sydney, with oil. No white man lives here, but an
intelligent chief governs well, and has foiled the attempts of
the kidnappers. There are native missionaries here, and the
church and school-house, large coral white-washed buildings, are
models of neatness. All the officers landed here; and it was a
sight to see them coming off afterwards, laden with mats, fowls,
and pigs, tramping down a mile of flat coral reef up to the
ankles and knees in water, to the canoes, which lay waiting on
the moonlit water to take them off to our boats.</p>
<p>On the 17th we communicated with Egg, or Netherland Island, a
crescent-shaped reef, with the horns of the crescent lying about
two miles and a half north and south of each other. The 200
inhabitants were all Christians, and had escaped the kidnapper;
their village stands on an islet on the southern horn. We sighted
the northmost island of the Ellice group next morning, to our
surprise fully forty miles out of position. This island differs
from the others of the group in having no guarding reef, and no
companion islands near it. It stands alone in the ocean, scarcely
raised above its level, and is simply a huge flat-topped coral
rock, two and a half miles by one and a half in extent, which
rises perpendicularly from fathomless depths, and is crowded over
with cocoa-nut trees. It is only saved from being washed over by
the sea by a narrow shore reef, on which the great surf expends
itself. We pulled to the edge of the boiling surf and met canoes,
which landed us without a wetting, and were received on the beach
with the most intense curiosity by the natives, who had never
seen a man-of-war before. They are a well-looking, dark,
straight-haired race, and number 417 souls, a large population
for so small an island, but their food is abundant; an unlimited
supply of cocoa-nuts, fowls, pigs, flying-fish, skip-jack, and
sharks. Native missionaries have been two years at work here, but
half the people are as yet devil-worshippers, and adore the evil
spirit under the form of cocoa-nut leaves, skip-jacks, and wooden
posts. Every heathen family has a small devil-hut, in which a
tiny grass hammock is slung for the evil spirit to sleep in, and
where offerings of fresh nuts are brought him every morning; many
of these huts were in full use, but we were pleased to find
others forsaken. The people looked very picturesque dressed in
their sole garment the Ti-ti, and seeing that I admired it they
gave me one made of the bark of the cocoa-nut tree beaten out and
cut into ribbons, which were dyed with red ochre. They are
governed by a king and a chief, and both these potentates, fat
ugly-looking men, received us with much ceremony in their
"talking-house", a building with a high pitched roof, which comes
down within three feet of the ground, the space left between the
roof and the ground being perfectly open all round. They sat
cross-legged on the ground, and listened with most attentive
faces, whilst I told them, through the resident white man how
glad I was to find they were kind to white people; that every
man-of-war that followed the "Basilisk" would therefore be
friendly to them, but that if they ever behaved otherwise, a ship
would come and punish them. After this we shook hands and talked
generally, and they presented us with nuts, fowls, and fruit, in
return for our gifts of fish-hooks and looking-glasses. Their
mode of procuring fresh water is curious. They cut the coral rock
to a depth of twenty feet, and make an opening wide at the top
and narrowing into three small holes below, which fill with a
brackish water as the tide rises. They have not any other supply,
but do not need it, as they have an unlimited supply of cocoa-nut
milk.</p>
<p>On the 20th we communicated with Hudson Island, in latitude
6&deg; 30', longitude 176&deg; 40' E. The description of the
foregoing island will serve equally for this; but here the
fringing shore reef is composed of red coral, which looks
beautiful when the receding surf allows its bright wet tints to
show. The poor people, who are Christians, but go about nearly
unclothed, received us very kindly&mdash;one man actually kissing
me with every sign of affection. Leaving Hudson, we sailed in
search of an island named Gran-cocal, the existence of which is
both affirmed and denied, but could find no trace of it, though
we sailed right over its alleged position.</p>
<p>At St. Augustine, the last of the Ellice group visited by us,
the people are all devil-worshippers, and have never suffered any
missionaries to come amongst them.</p>
<p>The village is on the east side of the principal islet, off
which a broad shore reef of reddish coral extends, springing up
like a wall from the depths of the ocean. On this the surf beats
with terrific violence, and runs up in a mass of white foam to
the beach beyond. The natives bring thin frail canoes to the edge
of the reef, and hold on, lost in foam, till a lull occurs, and
then they launch and paddle for their lives, rising like feathers
over the next gigantic surf. Mr. Bentley and I went in the galley
to the edge of the surf, but it seemed as impossible to land
safely as to go down the Falls of Niagara and live. At intervals
the surf, it is said, subsides, so as to allow boats to land. The
islanders seeing, came off to us, and thus made it needless for
us to land; they have a bad reputation, so we persuaded some to
come on board, and fired a few shot to give them an idea of the
white man's power.</p>
<p>Cherry Island, 500 miles south-west of St. Augustine, was our
next aim. Whilst on our way, on July 25th, a sad accident took
place; one of our best petty officers was struck senseless by a
blow on the head from a falling block during "sail drill", and
died in a few hours. We were comparatively so few in number, and
so mixed up together, that this death was almost as sad as a
death in a family, and much feeling was manifested the day we
buried him, as the poor body plunged sullenly into its "vast and
wandering grave". Constantly as we had drilled aloft, we had
never met with an accident till this, our first and last; and it
was a double one, for another poor fellow had dislocated his
thigh. On July 28th we made Cherry Island, a perfect little gem,
which nowhere exceeds one and a-half miles in extent, and rises
to a height of nearly 400 feet, in a hill, which produces the
most abundant supply of vegetables for the inhabitants, who live
in the wooded valley below. On nearing the island in our boats
numbers of natives swam off to us through the surf, holding
presents of cocoa-nuts and bananas high in one hand. I cannot
describe the ease and grace with which they swam; it was a
pleasure to watch them, the more so as they were altogether
agreeable to look at, being fine specimens of the light-coloured
Polynesian race. After a time they brought a canoe to us, and we
landed safely; and, their first timidity over, were permitted to
enter their huts, which are oval-shaped, and thatched close down
to the ground. I saw no weapons amongst them, indeed they do not
need them, as their nearest neighbours live on an island 120
miles distant.</p>
<p>Neither kidnappers nor missionaries have yet made any change
for evil or good in the primitive habits of these lonely
islanders. We left loaded by them with roots and fruits, and they
crowded on the beach to see us off.</p>
<p>After much wild weather through the 29th and 30th July, we
closed in next day on Duff's Islands, of the Santa Cruz group,
where the people are of the same dark, treacherous, Milanesian
type as their near neighbours at Nukupu, who martyred Bishop
Pattison. As we came near we could distinctly see the natives
hurrying their women and valuables into the bush. I went in with
two boats, prepared for defence, but having the arms concealed,
to speak a few canoes which kept at the edge of the reef. With
some trouble we induced one young man to come alongside, and then
our presents proved such a bait that all the canoes of the island
were soon swarming about us&mdash;but my desire was to land. The
natives were armed with powerful bows and arrows, which, they
made signs, were poisoned, and their appearance was fierce and
forbidding. They are ugly, tall thin men, and their nose-rings
and the shell ornaments which they wear in their ears, dragging
down the lobes nearly to the shoulder, make them quite hideous.
After some bartering, in which their honesty was remarkable, I
began to cross the reef towards their village, half expecting
them to object, instead of doing which they broke out into a
tumult of delight, and tracked the galley for us across the reef
with willing hands (Mr. Hayter remaining outside in the cutter),
so that Dr. Goodman and I soon reached the village. It stands on
a flat coral islet, about 200 yards in diameter, separated by a
narrow lagoon from a lofty island, which rises behind to the
height of 1000 feet. The larger island is densely wooded, but so
precipitous as to afford no foothold, except in a few spots near
the beach. The islet was surrounded by a wall or breastwork of
coral rock pieces, thrown up for defence, through which they led
us by an opening in the rear, and we found ourselves in the
village, which differed from anything we had yet seen, in that
the low thatched huts were not scattered about, but built in
rows, with wide beaten footpaths between, in which cocoa-nut
trees sprang up. At the rear of the village the great war canoes
were drawn up, powerful-looking boats, from sixty to seventy feet
long, with high ornamented prows, and a fighting platform in the
centre. The islanders showed us everything they possessed, and
then gave us some cooked bread-fruit and taro as a present indeed
the kindness of these poor savages was extreme. On our return
they would not allow us to do any work, but insisted on tracking
our boat and taking it outside the surf themselves. They may
possibly have considered us supernatural beings, for they
frequently took my hand and kissed it; they had certainly never
seen a man-of-war before, if our interpretation of their signs
was correct. I think they cannot have been visited by kidnappers,
or our reception would have been different; these men could have
made themselves very ugly customers. Their island is situated
only some fifty miles from Nukupu; and, as I have said, the
inhabitants are similar in appearance, and arms, and manner of
living; how comes it then that such a kindly reception was
accorded us here? I fear the answer must imply a condemnation of
the general conduct of white men towards natives. This particular
island has never (to my knowledge) been landed on before by
Europeans, and the natives, being thus unprejudiced, took us, as
they found us, and acted accordingly; whereas, at Nukupu, the
deeds of kidnappers had distinctly led up to the good Bishop's
death. This was one of the very few occasions on which I
disregarded my general rule of never landing amongst savages
unless the women and children were present, and I landed here,
feeling considerable apprehensions of evil. We went apparently
unarmed, but had our revolvers ready, and the men had their
rifles concealed.</p>
<p>We had anchored the ship on a coral bank, in ten fathom water,
but on going on board I found that the anchor had slipped off
into 100 fathoms, and found no bottom. Such are the coral walls
in these seas, or such, perhaps, the coral walls based on
volcanic rock.</p>
<p>August 1st.&mdash;On our way to Santa Cruz we passed near the
Island of Nukupu as the sun was setting. Used as I am to the
glowing Devonshire sunsets that Francis Danby loved to paint, I
had never seen sky and sea steeped in such colour and gold as
here.</p>
<p>To the south, Santa Cruz reared its wooded heights through
2000 feet of soft, grey air&mdash;its bold headland and coral
water line, and the cocoa-nut groves that mark the site of the
villages, just taking on their evening shades; to the west, from
a glassy sea of crimson, soft purples and gold, the mighty
volcanic cone of Tinakula rose abruptly into a sky as glorious,
rolling out from its top volumes of smoke dyed into flame by the
setting sun, whilst the base slept in its own cumbrous shadow; to
the north-west lay the little island of Nukupu, low and wooded,
the scene of Bishop Pattison's death; we felt that his last
sunset might have been like this, and then thought went further
than one cares to speak.</p>

<p><small>ON</small> August 2d we anchored at Santa Cruz Island,
in Byron's Bay, when we had scarce room to swing clear of the
rocks at either side; and the natives, who have an evil
reputation, not belied by their looks, came on board the ship in
numbers, eager to barter their bows and poisoned arrows, shell
ornaments, and mats, for our bottles and beads. Precautions were
taken in case of any trouble with the savages, but as women and
children mixed amongst the men I felt pretty easy.</p>
<p>The village is fortified by low coral walls, breast high, the
openings in which are overlapped by other walls, calculated to
throw an attacking party into some confusion. We were received
there in a friendly manner, and, our diplomatic work over, a
watering-party was landed, protected by a marine guard under
arms, and we went to enjoy ourselves by bathing in the beautiful
clear mountain stream that runs into the bay. This river, from
which we watered easily, flows through tropical forests, over a
clear sandy bottom. A track through the bush led to a favourable
shady spot, and our men were soon to be seen gathered in groups
on the river banks, bathing, washing their clothes, or lounging
in idle enjoyment&mdash;all making the most of the few quiet
hours we were able to spend there. Sailors well know how much
pleasure was sure to be taken out of a little paradise like this,
after long cooping up on shipboard.</p>
<p>Carlisle Bay, only a mile to the east of Byron Bay, appearing
a good anchorage, I explored it in my galley, and, from a cursory
examination, concluded it was so. Some of the officers came
overland, and joined me in the bay, where the natives were as
friendly as those of Byron Bay. An instance of honesty was shown
here which surprised us. My coxswain had traded a fowl from a
native, and, locking its wings, had laid it under the boat's
thwart, but the bird freed itself, and flew like a partridge to
the bush before we were 100 yards from the beach. The natives saw
what had happened, and on our returning to the village shortly
after, the owner of the fowl brought the trade back, and pressed
it upon us. We highly commended his honesty, but of course
refused to benefit by it.</p>
<p>The friendliness of these natives to us was remarkable; and I
have deeply regretted to learn that some difficulty has since
arisen between them and H.M. schooner "Sandfly", during her late
visit to this place, resulting in the loss of numerous native
lives. An event of this kind is to be regretted, not so much for
the present effect, as for the misunderstanding, the want of
confidence, and the revengeful feeling it produces in the
future.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz is only inhabited on a narrow strip round the
shore, the inner part being to all appearances given up to jungle
and forest. This fact contains in itself an answer to one weak
excuse which has been advanced in favour of the forced
deportation of South Sea Islanders, to the effect that they will
otherwise suffer privation of food as their numbers increase, for
it proves that these islands are in most cases able to support
enormously increased populations; and many of them have others in
close vicinity, which are still absolutely uninhabited.</p>
<p>Leaving Byron's Bay on the 5th, we reached the volcanic
mountainous island of Mount Edgecombe, which had never been
surveyed nor landed upon, as far as we knew, and spent the day in
surveying its surrounding reef, to find a channel through if
possible. We had no success that day in finding a ship channel,
although for some miles the reef was submerged to a depth of six
or eight feet, so stood off and on during the night, which was an
anxious one, blinding thick, with tremendous rain squalls. In the
morning we turned to work with the first light, and were well
paid for our trouble, for we found a passage of four fathoms over
the reef, leading into a lagoon big enough to hold a navy, with a
fine harbour at the head. This important harbour Lieutenant
Hayter, Nav.-Lieutenant Mourilyan, and I roughly, but carefully
surveyed, and were satisfied with its capabilities. We called it
Basilisk Harbour, in honour of the ship, and felt rather proud of
our discovery; for previous visitors had pronounced the island
wholly inaccessible on account of its surrounding reef. This fine
harbour is shaped like a boot, the leg being about one and a-half
miles long, and the foot, from heel to toe, about two miles, and
contains anchorage-ground sufficient for the British navy. High,
well-wooded land surrounds the harbour, and there are several
native villages on the beach.</p>

<br>
<p>The natives, who were woolly-headed and black, were quiet and
friendly, but a degraded, wretched-looking race. They had no mats
nor articles worth bartering for, which we regretted, as this
sort of little commerce often opens the way quickly towards a
good understanding.</p>
<p>At T&eacute;vai Bay, Vanikoro Island, the scene of the
disaster of "La Perouse", we anchored on the 9th. Lieutenant
Smith landed to conciliate the timid and suspicious people we saw
awaiting us, with arrows on the string ready for instant use; and
going boldly amongst them, succeeded in winning half their
confidence. They thawed, but still kept the arrows ready. They
permitted us to go to their village on Direction Islet, and I
took two armed boats there, as the distance from the ship was
considerable, and very few women were visible. We found the
village nearly deserted, and remained there an hour, successfully
trading with the people that remained, followed all the time,
however, by a number of men who watched our movements
suspiciously.</p>
<p>We certainly left a good impression on their minds, which was
of course the object in view; but I would gladly have spent a
week with them and confirmed it. An interpreter would have been
invaluable. They are precisely similar in appearance to the
Edgecombe Islanders. The coral here is of extraordinary beauty;
we saw some through a shallow depth of water on the reef, of an
exquisite blue colour, the very tint that may be seen down the
crevasse of a glacier, but it faded on being taken out of the
water.</p>
<p>We sighted the Torres group on the 9th. It consists of four
principal coral-volcanic islands, and a few small ones, from four
to six miles in length, running north and south, and separated
from each other by narrow channels. It was blowing hard; but
directly we came under their lee we rode at shelter in blue
water, with scarce a ripple, the coral beach, with its still dark
green background, looking very peaceful after the stormy sea we
had just crossed. I went with two boats to make friends with some
natives on the beach, but when we landed they drew off to about
half a bowshot from us, and stood ready with the bow. We advanced
a few paces, and they retreated into the bush, where it would
have been madness to follow them. At last, in despair of
communicating, I sent every one back to the boats, except trusty
Mr. Bentley, the gunner, and he and I advanced alone and
apparently unarmed, but with pistols hidden, making friendly
signs. On getting pretty near the bush I placed a bright coloured
handkerchief on the ground, and retired a little. Two of the
boldest soon came forward, and prodded it with their bow ends,
evidently suspecting some trap, then they took it, went back into
the bush, and came out again with cocoa-nuts, which they laid on
the same spot for us to take them. This we did, making signs of
acceptance and gratitude.</p>
<p>By degrees we got amongst them, and then our bright beads and
fish-hooks completed their captivation. They are black
Milanesians, perfectly unclothed, with hair frizzed out a foot
from their heads, and rather repulsive looking. Before we left
they surrounded our boats, eager to barter all they had. I
mention our delay in establishing relations with them, to show
that our successors need not be discouraged by a little
difficulty at starting. Pleasant looks, a quiet confident manner,
and a soft tone of voice, soon gain on them, and a judicious
display of bright coloured articles easily catches their
attention. It is also well to be patient, and not show any haste
or anxiety. They are very children these South Sea people, and
should be persuaded as such. The ornaments worn here are
peculiar. No tortoise-shell nor pearl shell ornaments were to be
seen; but instead, cylinders of polished ebony, neatly tipped
with mother of pearl at the ends, were worn, thrust through the
cartilage of the nose and ear. These cylinders are about an inch
and a half long, and three-quarters of an inch in diameter. They
also wore ivory armlets&mdash;the tusks of a peculiar kind of
boar, which they always keep tied up, so as to prevent any injury
to the tusk. Leaving these people, we ran down to the next
island, and picking out a lovely bay, anchored for the night. The
natives here were more easily approached than their neighbours,
but did not become so confiding. They bartered, but only at arm's
length, and with a few of us at a time. We could not discover
their villages, and it would have been imprudent to venture into
the bush to look for them. Indeed, I had a sort of escape here.
Mr. Bentley saw a native on the point of striking at my head with
his club, who refrained when he saw himself perceived; but Mr.
Bentley's quick eye and ready pistol would doubtless have stopped
the savage's blow had he attempted it.</p>
<p>Mr. Mourilyan and I were early astir next morning, and made a
running survey of the anchorage, to which we gave the name of the
senior lieutenant, and called it Hayter Bay. It is a roomy
anchorage, and well sheltered from the prevailing wind. The two
remaining islands of the Torres group were visited by us on
August 10th, and we found the people very difficult of access at
first. Eventually, however, we made friends with them, but not
having interpreters could not find out if they had been visited
by kidnappers. Our work as pioneers of Christianity and
civilisation at many of these islands was very anxious, and to
some extent dangerous, and kept our faculties in a state of
tension. On the last island we found a native who spoke a little
English. He said that kidnapping vessels had never been seen
here; but he might have been a kidnapping agent himself, for what
we could tell.</p>
<p>The north end of Espiritu Santo is indented by a large gulf,
up which we steered on making the island, and found an anchorage
at the head of the gulf, off the mouth of the river Jordan, so
named by the old Spaniards, according to their delight in
Scripture names. Lieutenant Hayter and I examined the river for
some distance on Monday 12th, and found it navigable for boats
for about a mile above the sea. It is simply a fine rapid
torrent, coming from a lofty range of hills, and running, at the
lower part of its course, through rich, open country, and forms a
boundary between two powerful tribes, who appear to live in a
state of warfare. The inhabitants of Espiritu Santo are black,
fine athletic men, woolly-headed, many of them with really
pleasing faces. They are well armed with clubs, and three-pronged
spears barbed with human bones, which they throw to a great
distance. They placed great value on their weapons, making signs
of their urgent need of them to guard against the attacks of
their enemies at the other side of the river, and would not sell
me a club. They showed no jealousy of their women, which was a
new feature since our leaving the Christianised islands; so we
went freely about amongst the unsightly Eves, who regarded us
with much amazement. They were all but unclad, and hideously ugly
by nature and fashion, for the upper front teeth had been
extracted, the hair cropped short, and in most cases the poor
black face daubed over with charcoal. The material for
civilisation to work on here is certainly very rough and raw. We
made up a party for shooting wild duck, and ascending the river a
short way, landed and went up the country, on its banks, of which
we much admired the richness. Wild sugar-cane, wild pine-apples,
and other tropical fruits, grew in abundance; and the land seemed
easy of cultivation. Doubtless, in time, Australia will throw off
settlers to this glorious island, which is capable of bearing all
the spices of the East. The natives were delighted with us, and
eagerly showed us the best spots for duck, which were there in
any quantities, but very wild&mdash;probably from being
constantly made targets for the native arrows.</p>
<p>There was a sort of natural lock across the river, from which
it ran furiously down a steep descent for eighty yards, forming a
fine slide for our many bathers, who allowed themselves to be
swept away like corks the whole distance, and had good sport.</p>
<p>We visited, on Tuesday 13th, one of the curious volcanic
cone-shaped islands, not uncommon in these seas. This
one&mdash;Star Island&mdash;rises in a perfect cone to the height
of 2900 feet, and is densely wooded and thickly populated, though
it has no water and no natural soil. It is, however, highly
fertile, for the pulverised scoria has been mixed with such a
quantity of decayed vegetable matter as to create a rich deposit.
The natives are well accustomed to white men, and many of them
had gone in labour vessels to Queensland and worked in the
plantations. Some told us that they meant to go again&mdash;an
evident proof of kind treatment, and explained that they
understood the nature of the agreement made by them with the
Queensland labour vessels. One of the mission boys, with whom I
talked at Norfolk Island, was a native of this isle. We climbed
up the precipitous side of the cone for eight or nine hundred
feet, through a thick forest, meeting with native huts perched
about on every holding-ledge, halting often to refresh ourselves
with cocoa-nut milk, for the ascent was almost perpendicular, and
we were obliged to use hands and feet to surmount the gnarled
roots which spread like bars across the rough native track, and
to climb some overhanging ledges. The crater at the summit is now
extinct. In many places the ground was artificially terraced, to
make room for houses to stand. The natives lead a sort of
fly-like existence, having to cling on with hands and feet
whenever they stir outside their doors. They were innocent of
clothing, and worshipped idols of the most hideous kind. It is to
be hoped that the lads from this island, now being educated at
the Milanesian college, will be able to cope with this idolatry
on their return.</p>
<p>On August 15th we reached Mota, the principal island station
of the late Bishop Pattison. This island, called Sugar Loaf by
the English, from its shape, rises to a height of 1350 feet. Its
people, about 2000 in number, are much attached to the
mission.</p>
<p>I was met on landing by the Rev. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Palmer,
who led us by a steep slippery path to the mission-house, where
every sign of real good work was to be seen. The system pursued
appeared to be quiet and methodic. The educated deacons from
Norfolk Island are evidently well-approved and instructed men.
Having talked matters over with Mr. Palmer, I secured the
pleasure and advantage of his company for a few days to the
neighbouring islands,&mdash;Valua or Saddle Island, Bligh Island
(where an extinct crater has formed a large bay), and St. Maria.
At this latter place we received a hearty welcome on landing from
several hundreds of savages, who wore no clothes, and were armed
with deadly arrows. Amongst them we saw one who was the happy
owner of a red shirt and double-barrelled gun, and he spoke
English well, and told us that he had spent five years in
Australia. We talked about kidnapping, and he observed, "All
black men savey, no kidnapping now; if black man like to go he
go, if he like to stop he stop", a valuable piece of testimony
from this group of islands, long the principal scene of
kidnapping.</p>
<p>On standing down the south side of the island we fell in with
a ketch of twenty tons, with twenty-one natives on board, and no
licence to carry them. The owner, as well as the master, was on
board, and told us that he had a cotton plantation at Sandwich
Island, and was willing to provide himself with legal papers, but
as yet had not had an opportunity. After much consideration, the
natives being evidently free agents, and the new Act not as yet
come into force, I decided on sending Lieutenant Smith to
Sandwich Island in the ketch, and he parted company
accordingly.</p>
<p>On Sunday, August 18th, we sheltered from a southerly gale
under the lee of Aurora Island, where the paymaster of the
"Rosario" had been cruelly clubbed, and all but killed on the
beach. Knowing that here, and at all the islands south of this,
the natives are very treacherous, I landed with great caution,
taking some spare hands with loaded rifles in the galley, but
walked apparently unarmed towards the natives. A lad of thirteen
or fourteen allowed me to approach him, so I gave him some beads,
after which the savages came closer, but kept a reserve body
behind the rocks, ready to let their deadly arrows fly at a
moment's notice. The women, who were repulsively ugly, were
unclothed, and the men nearly so. They traded with us a little,
but did not take to us at all heartily, and remained shy and
distrustful to the last.</p>
<p>On Monday, the gale having moderated, we ran down to Aoba, or
Leper's Island, only twenty miles distant, and here the natives
flocked down quite unarmed to trade with us, which fact confirmed
me in the idea I had formed that there is often very little
inter-communication between the islands of some of the groups.
These islanders were perfectly confiding, and eagerly surrounded
us on the beach, seeming to take interest in our looks and
gestures. One little occurrence cemented our friendship. Mr.
Hayter turned up his sleeve to please them, and catching sight of
some tattoo marks he had acquired in Japan, they compared them
with their own tattooing, and went off into fits of delight. We
stayed bartering with them for a long time, and they brought us
down quite a collection of the boar's tusk armlets, which are
really handsome ornaments, and if mounted with a golden
snake-head and tail, and a pair of emerald eyes, would not be
unworthy to be worn on fair wrists at home. They would not,
however, dispose of the best armlets for anything we could offer.
They were clothed in a small degree, both men and women.</p>
<p>We landed next day on Pentecost&mdash;a fine island, 38 miles
in length; and using every caution, found the people friendly. On
the night of August 21st we anchored under the lee of Ambrym
Island, and I went on shore to open an intercourse, but in vain.
The natives of all these isles are afraid of darkness, and never
venture out after sunset. In the morning Mr. Hayter and I went
again, and we became good friends. They sold us some of their
common clubs, on which a certain two of us gave vent to our
spirits, and celebrated the <i>entente cordiale</i> by dancing an
English war-dance, whooping, and nourishing the clubs in true
savage style. At this the savages shouted with delight and
laughter, and called to all their friends to come and see. It
will readily be believed that our friendship progressed rapidly
after the exhibition of such kindred customs; and I was well
pleased to have it so, the more so as a native had threatened to
strike me with his tomahawk on landing. The act was perhaps only
the result of timidity on his part, and I was prepared to
intercept the blow; but it showed that these people might have
been dangerous. Leaving this island, and steering south, we had a
fine view of its volcanic mountain, 3000 feet high, from which
volumes of smoke issued, and sometimes jets of flame. The sides
of the mountain are cut into deep gullies, where rivers of lava
have flowed down. Grand as this object was, it was eclipsed by
the glorious cone-shaped island of Lopevi, which was here in
sight, springing in perfect symmetry to a height of 5000 feet
above the sea. Its summit is divided into two huge lips, from
which belch continual smoke and fire. These two volcanoes are not
twenty miles apart. We landed at the latter, and found the people
friendly; but very few live here, and these only at the base of
the volcano. It must need some courage to live in such proximity;
we were surprised to find any inhabitants.</p>
<p>Off Mallicolo, a splendid island, 56 miles in length, we
anchored in a fine harbour, about which the land was well wooded,
and diversified by hill and plain. The natives received us well
on our landing, and took us to the top of the hill on which their
village was built, when we were met by a perfect picture of
savage life. The thatched huts were scattered about under the
trees, so low that we had to creep serpent fashion to get in, and
when inside could scarce sit upright. The Devil-ground presented
a unique picture of savage superstition. It was a large cleared
space, and contained a collection of frightful-looking idols,
some twenty feet in height, and broad in proportion, hollowed out
to serve the purpose of drums. Soft-wood drum-sticks lay beside
them, and on being struck they emitted a hollow monotonous sound.
The shape of these idols was very rude; they were all head and
body, with very small arms stuck on, of which the hands rested on
the stomach, and the legs were smaller than the arms&mdash;the
whole being devoid of action or expression. Near one, a gigantic
idol surrounded by a bamboo fence, a poor girl suffering from an
ulcerated leg was placed for cure, and lay looking dejected
enough, as if she knew the hopelessness of the charm; nor was the
behaviour of her elders at all calculated to increase the girl's
reverence, for they showed no respect themselves, and only
laughed when we struck the huge idols and made them emit a dull
resonance. Most of the women wore waist-cloths, but the men were
naked. The manners of both were most kind and friendly to us.
Several of the men told us that they had gone to Queensland in
the labour vessels, and having been well-treated by the planters,
and given plenty of trade, were anxious to go again. Our views as
to the evils of the labour traffic began to be much modified by
the nature of the natives' testimony. In cases where the
labour-compact is perfectly understood and agreed to by the
natives, and where the conditions are afterwards faithfully
adhered to, a positive good may result, and an impetus be given
to the improvement of these races by the contact with
civilisation. Stringent laws securing justice, paternal
treatment, and religious instruction, are highly necessary; and
will doubtless be hailed by the mass of employers, as assisting
them to discharge their duties on a well-considered and
systematic system; they will rejoice to see crime and cruelty
made impossible, and to be relieved from the disgrace of any
supposed partnership with wretches who have disgraced the English
name.</p>
<p>Auxiliary labour is a necessity in Queensland, from the nature
of the soil, which produces crops that require minute attention;
and from the unfitness of the European for labour in its hot
latitudes, it will always remain so. The fact of such a necessity
existing, is, to a believer in Providence, a proof that it is
capable of being dealt with in a satisfactory manner. Neither the
philanthropy nor the power to alchemise this social difficulty
into good are lacking in Queensland, and the experience of years
has furnished a sufficient fund of fact to be drawn on in the
construction of a perfect system&mdash;one beneficial to employer
and employed. I say "perfect" advisedly, because we, in this
generation, have attained to clear moral perceptions of duty
towards aboriginal races, and an increased power of putting such
into practice. It should be as perfect as possible, and made so
speedily, because any neglect in treating so vital a question
must be prolific of future evil in an incalculable ratio; and
issues that can now be grasped in the hand, and dealt with, will
soon by natural increase become too vast for control; witness the
issues of the slave question in the United States of America. Our
position makes us guardians of the nonage of these undeveloped
races: and our responsibility should, in my opinion, be accepted,
even to the limit of taking all the unclaimed islands in the
Australian neighbourhood under our protection. The terrible
atrocities which have occurred in connection with the labour
trade, and which can never be forgotten&mdash;never remembered
but with sorrow and shame, have drawn public attention to this
subject, as perhaps nothing else would, and emphasised the demand
for exhaustive legislation.</p>
<p>It presents itself to my mind, that the demand for labour will
become increasingly disproportionate to its supply from these
islands, as they are rather under than over populated. New
Guinea, if annexed, will perhaps assist in the solution of this
difficulty.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Hayter, Drs. Goodman and Haines, and I, visited a
small island, named Shepherd Isle, near Api, on the 24th, when I
was compelled to submit to a singular process of exorcism before
we were permitted to land. A devil-man, fantastically painted,
and adorned with leaves and flowers, waded out to meet our boat,
waving a bunch of palm-leaves rapidly round his head, and as I
jumped on shore he rushed at me, and grasping my right hand,
waved the leaves round my head in the same manner. I saw that he
meant no harm, so let him have his way, and he placed the leaves
in my left hand, putting a small green twig into his mouth, still
holding me fast, and then, as if with great effort, drew the twig
from his mouth&mdash;this was extracting the evil
spirit&mdash;after which he blew violently as if to speed it
away. I now held a twig between my teeth, and he went through the
same process, all the time showing signs of strong
excitement.</p>
<p>He led me then to the edge of the bush, and I began to feel
rather reluctant, and doubtful as to how all was going to end,
but thought I had better see it out. Here two sticks, ornamented
with leaves, were fixed in the ground, and bent to an angle at
the top, with leaves tied to the point, and round these sticks
the devil-man and I raced in breathless circles till I was
perfectly dizzy. He, however, did not seem to mind it at all, and
presently flew off with me up a steep path into the bush, when,
at a short distance, we came to two smaller sticks crossed; here
he dropped my hand, and taking the bunch of palm-leaves from me,
waved them, and sprang over the sticks and back again. Then
placing both his hands on my shoulders, he leaped with
extraordinary agility, bringing his knees to the level of my face
at each bound, as if to show that he had conquered the devil, and
was now trampling him into the earth. When he had leaped for a
while, he made signs that all was over, and we walked back
together to the officers who had been rather anxiously watching
these singular proceedings. The natives who had kept quietly
aloof, now came freely about us, and showed by their manner that
they considered us free of the island. Had I not submitted, we
certainly should not have had any communication. They took us up
to their fortified village by a walk of a mile and a half,
through forest and cultivated fields of yam, taro, and
sugar-cane; and there a roast pig was set before us, over which
the devil-man and I were forced to go through no end of
ceremonies, which he ended by stamping the devil into two large
holes which he had worn in the earth by constant efforts. He then
tore the pig into pieces, and gave me the first. I handed it to
the chief, and he gave me a large piece for myself, which I had
to hold with a great war-club in the same hand, till a given
signal was made, when I was supposed to eat it. After the feast
we were free to roam about as we pleased. Many of the natives
here had been kidnapped, and had since returned home, and were
consequently well able to make themselves understood. They also
agreed in saying "white men no steal black men now". The idols in
the village were similar to those I have just described. The same
day we steered for a similar island only a few miles distant,
named Three Hill Island, and here also were invited to visit the
village. We reached it by a delightful walk of two miles through
forest, and about one through well-kept plantations of yam and
taro, the ground steadily ascending till it reached a height of
800 or 900 feet above the sea, where the village stood. Its
natives have the credit of being bloodthirsty and treacherous. On
this small island, which is only about four by three miles in
extent, there are three tribes, each speaking a different
dialect, and each at fierce war with the others. The tribe
visited by us appeared highly prosperous and contented, and we
were pleased to see that the women seemed to do the light work
and the men the heavy.</p>
<p>We remained at the village for an hour, the cynosure of all
eyes, and did a brisk trade at easy rates, giving a knife for a
pig; two or three strings of beads for a fowl, and lesser prices
for fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>On our first visit to Montague Island, or Niguna, no natives
were to be seen. I landed there and strolled along the beach,
shouting for some to appear, for I had little doubt but that we
were observed, but as they had recently been fired upon, and had
their villages burned by one of our ships, they were timid. After
a time five or six men, armed with muskets and tomahawks,
appeared; and, backed by three followers, I went up and presented
them with a couple of trade handkerchiefs, on which they became
fairly friendly, and told me that the missionary, Mr. Milne,
lived on the other side of the island. I was anxious to get to
Havannah harbour, Sandwich Island, that night, and meet
Lieutenant Smith in the ketch, so I resolved to defer my visit to
Mr. Milne, and we sailed for Sandwich at once. On Sunday, 25th,
we anchored in this really noble Havannah harbour, and were
filled with admiration of its capacity and sheltering power. The
island, which is the most fertile of the New Hebrides group,
extends about 20 miles each way, and is almost English in
appearance; partial clearings have been made, and wooden
buildings spring up round the anchorage at the head of the
harbour, and attest the presence of the pushing Anglo-Saxon race.
All the settlers are cotton-planters, and seem to have a good
chance for making money, as the natives sell land greedily, and
the cotton grown is of good quality. It was a relief to my mind
to find Mr. Smith and the ketch safe and sound, as we had
experienced some heavy weather since our parting. This little
vessel I restored with much pleasure to the master and owner, on
their addressing a formal request, and stating the exceptional
circumstances of their case. This settled, a deputation of
planters came forward with a memorial, stating that a necessity
existed for extra labour on their thriving cotton plantations,
and praying for a license to import it. Then the land sales of
the natives, and other magisterial affairs, came on for
settlement, and just as we drew to a conclusion word came that a
schooner, the "Van Tromp", had been wrecked on Three Hill Island,
and her captain and part of her crew murdered by a tribe
adjoining the one we had visited a few days before. This called
for prompt action, and we left immediately for the scene of the
wreck, taking with us some of the crew who had escaped, and
brought the report. The evidence was very complete, and I woke on
the morning of the 27th with the feeling that some of our number
would be no more in all probability before the sun set, for the
tribe accused was armed with muskets, and we should be at
disadvantage if we had to follow up the offenders. At 8
<small>A.M</small>. we were abreast of the schooner lying on the
reef, and saw that she was crowded with pilfering natives, who,
on seeing us, cleared out and fled into the bush, after which
neither native nor white man was to be seen; a little dog
belonging to the ship was straying about on the beach, and
howling pitifully.</p>
<p>I had not the faintest hope of finding the men alive, but
determined not to begin hostilities till I had exhausted every
effort to persuade or force the native chiefs to an interview. We
boarded the schooner first, and I was surprised to see no trace
of bloodshed; then I pulled for the beach, taking with me Mr.
Freeman, the master of a trading schooner, whom I had brought on
account of his knowledge of native character. As we landed a
crowd of natives came out of the bush armed with muskets, of
which some men carried two. When within a hundred yards of shore
our boat grounded on the reef, and we had to wade the rest of the
distance. Accompanied by four armed men, and backed up by the
crew which remained in the boat, and which would have poured in a
deadly volley at a sign, Mr. Freeman and I advanced, and, every
step that I took assured me more and more that the people were
only frightened, and meant us no harm. It proved so; and further,
to our hearty pleasure, we learned that the captain and men were
alive. They were at a long distance from the wreck; but after
some little delay they joined us safe and sound, and highly
praised the humanity of the natives, who had actually helped them
through the surf to land, and then treated them with kindness.
After a little talk the natives brought back everything they had
taken from the vessel; and next day, on clearing out the schooner
to see if there was any chance of getting her off, I gave them
two bags of biscuit and some tobacco and powder in return for the
kind treatment which the shipwrecked captain and crew had
received at their hands. They were delighted, and fully
appreciated this and our praise. There was no hope of getting the
schooner off, her bottom being staved in, so we dismantled her,
took her stores on board to be landed at Havannah harbour, and
then went on that evening to Montague Island, which we reached in
the dark. The natives being as usual too superstitious to stir
out at night, we could not find any when we landed, but by
continued shouting we got some of the missionary people to hear,
and they brought Mr. Milne the missionary to us, who kindly gave
me all the information I required as to the state of the
island.</p>
<p>On the 29th we returned to Havannah harbour, and at the
request of the planters I visited some of the cotton plantations.
Doubtless in a few years a flourishing town will have arisen
where the rude open houses of the settlers now stand. Many acres
of land are already cleared and producing the finest cotton.
Steam machinery for cleaning and ginning the cotton is already at
work. The forerunners of civilisation in these splendid islands
deserve all the support the Imperial Government can give them,
and will doubtless have it as their wants become known. We came
on many parties of natives grubbing away at the ground to prepare
it for cotton, and they seemed to work cheerily and well. They
had plenty of food and to spare, for the fertility and rapidity
of nature here is unbounded. For example, I was shown sweet
potatoes but nine days planted, and the stems were already from
twelve to fourteen inches long. Castor-oil plants and sugar-cane,
the growth of six months, were from fourteen to fifteen feet
high. The trees here are very rich, some of them of large size,
bearing lovely blossoms and rich oil-nuts. One, called the
candle-nut tree, shoots up to the height of 150 feet, and its
great branches, covered with small silvery-green leaves, bear
millions of nuts. These nuts, which have a shell as hard as
stone, contain a sort of oil as thick as the substance of a
composite candle, and burn with a brilliant light.</p>
<p>I will not weary the reader with an account of our visits to
all the small islands, for they presented features of much
sameness. We often felt our duties monotonous, but had the
comfort of knowing that we were collecting a mass of information
which will all prove useful in time, and in some sort preparing
the native mind for a good reception of our countrymen to
come.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><small>DILLON'S BAY, ERROMANGA, AND MURDER
OF MR. GORDON&mdash;OUR ACTION&mdash;A SUNKEN WHALE&mdash;WASTE
OF SANDAL WOOD&mdash;TANNA&mdash;ITS VOLCANO&mdash;A LONELY
COTTON PLANTER&mdash;ARRIVE AT FRENCH SETTLEMENT AT NUMEA, WHICH
CONCLUDES CRUISE.</small></p>
<p><small>ON</small> our arrival at Dillon's Bay, Erromanga,
September 1st, I found that a missionary named Gordon had been
murdered in the February before, a brother of the former Mr.
Gordon, missionary, who, with his wife, had been murdered on this
island. It appears that Mr. Gordon had worked nobly for five
years amongst the worst heathen natives, in the east of the
island, and drawn together a congregation of forty-five people,
including children. His death was caused by the credulity of a
father, to whose sick children he had given medicine. The
children dying, he conceived the idea that the missionary had
killed them, and murdered him in revenge. It is remarkable that
Mr. Gordon, who was translating the Bible into the Erromanga
tongue, should just have made a version of the last verse of
Acts, 12th chapter, which relates the death of Stephen, before he
went out to the grass in front of his house to rest, and was
struck down. Had matters remained in this state, my course of
action would have been plain; but a complication had arisen; the
native Christians from Dillon's Bay had flown to "the wild
justice of revenge", treacherously fallen on some isolated
members of the guilty tribe, and killed four. Two of these
retaliators were communicants.</p>
<p>On arriving at Dillon's Bay I consulted with the three white
residents&mdash;a missionary, and two white men who have
established a whale-fishery here; and having obtained from them
an exact account of all that had taken place, decided to bring
the Christian east and heathen west chiefs together if possible,
and tell them that, as the Christians had improperly taken the
law into their own hands, I should not inflict further punishment
if they would give me an assurance of living peaceably for the
future. I despatched messengers to secure the attendance of the
Christian chiefs, and by 11 o'clock <small>P.M</small>. had nine
of them on board the "Basilisk"; one old chief had an arrow-head
in his back, which native skill had failed to extract, and was
all but disabled, but we made him as comfortable as we could.</p>
<p>A beautiful stream runs between precipitous hills into the
head of Dillon's Bay, on one bank of which lies the missionary
settlement, and on the other a whaling establishment. Here the
good John Williams was killed; and the graves of the martyred
Gordons, and of a missionary who died of fever and ague, gleamed
white in the setting sunshine before us that evening, and filled
the heart with many thoughts of those who had not counted their
lives dear unto them. Next morning we steamed round to the scene
of the murder, on the east side of the island, taking the nine
chiefs; and when arrived, Lieutenant Sydney Smith landed with
them to meet the eastern chiefs, and invite them on board, with
power, in case of their being too frightened to come, to cause
them to "make a paper", <i>i.e</i>. to affix their mark to a
satisfactory paper to be drawn up by him, after being made to
understand our reasons for not punishing them. This done, he was
to direct them to shake hands all round. Finding them terribly
alarmed, he took the latter course with perfect success, and
finished by informing them that the tribes must assemble and meet
me on the following day, when I should bring plenty of white men
to meet them, and show them that we had not lacked power to
punish them.</p>
<p>Next morning, being joined by several friendly chiefs, we
marched 100 seamen and marines four miles to the place where poor
Gordon was murdered, and reaching a considerable stream, which
forms the boundary of the offending tribe, found the people so
terror-stricken that the only chance of getting at them was for
me to cross, with two or three others alone. This I did, wading
across, and having drawn the natives together on a grassy
hillock, overlooking the opposite bank, I directed their
attention to the movements of our men there, who were then put
through skirmishing movements and volley firing by Lieutenant
Hayter. The natives were ready to sink into the earth with fear
and amazement. I then addressed them, one of the Christian chiefs
interpreting, and told them that we forgave them this time, but
that a ship would come and punish them if they ever harmed one
hair of a white man's head again; on which they made earnest
promises, which, I trust, will be kept.</p>
<p>Close to the spot stood the remains of poor Gordon's house,
with the floors torn up, and nothing but the roof and framework
left&mdash;a picture of ruin. His tasteful garden was fast
becoming a wilderness, and his books were all scattered about in
an adjoining hut that he had fitted up as his little library. We
collected as many as filled four large chests, and brought them
down for auction. In the indignant feeling that such a sight
provoked, we were for a moment ready to regret that the right to
punish had been taken out of our hands. Reflection showed,
however, that not only would our line of action have been
approved by Mr. Gordon himself, but that it was wise, in view of
the safety of present and future white inhabitants; as also in
producing the settlement of a question that would otherwise have
led to a <i>vendetta</i> between the two tribes, that would
probably have gone on to the extinction of one.</p>
<p>Standing in for Dillon's Bay on the morning of the 4th, we saw
the whaling boats belonging to Messrs. Smith and Guy, the
enterprising whalers settled here, fast to a large whale; the
lines fouled, however, and they had to cut adrift.</p>
<p>The whales are frequently lost after being killed, through the
boats lacking power to tow them on shore. We passed a spot where
a whale had sunk in forty fathoms water, some weeks before, and
observed that the surface was covered with oil, and that a
powerful stench prevailed. Messrs. Smith and Guy have now got
engines from Sydney, and built a small steamer with their own
hands, which will doubtless prevent such losses for the future.
Erromanga was once famous for its sandal wood, which is worth
&pound;25 a ton on the spot, but most of the trees have been
ruthlessly destroyed.</p>
<p>Such instances of a waste of natural riches, from want of
knowledge, are to my mind an argument in favour of the annexation
of these islands to Australia.</p>
<p>On September 6th we anchored off "Black Beach", Tanna Island,
the scene of the engagement between H.M.S. "Iris" and the
natives, some fifteen years ago, and since then of many a lawless
kidnapping affray. Two labour vessels lay close, to us, engaged
in procuring natives, one of which, by a strange coincidence, was
commanded by a man who twenty years before had served as a seaman
on board the "Basilisk". The papers of both vessels were all
right. Near the anchorage was the cotton plantation of one of the
most notorious of those lawless men who have been charged with
the commission of frightful crimes in procuring labour from the
islands, and who, with reckless hardihood, have planted
themselves in solitary independence on these islands, prepared to
defend their possessions, purchased for a few old Tower muskets,
by the terror they inspire. The owner of the plantation came on
board to pay his respects, and I looked with curiosity on this
specimen of a class of men who, with all their great faults,
possess many of the rough strong virtues of Englishmen. He was a
big, burly, middle-aged man, with a large red beard and
moustache, a small nose, surmounted by light, restless, blue
eyes, and a low square forehead, which betokened the power to
will and do without regard to consequences. He walked with
difficulty, from more than one gunshot wound received from the
natives. Landing with him, and climbing the steep cliffs that
bounded the beach, we found ourselves on an open rising
table-land, about thirty acres of which was in full bearing of
the best kind of cotton, and fifty or sixty acres more were lying
ready to be added within the next three months. This land, with
some thousand acres of grass land adjoining, all nominally
belonged to my companion. Gangs of natives from other
islands&mdash;(for natives will not labour on their own
islands)&mdash;were at work, and appeared to be well fed, and
happy enough in the prospect of becoming the possessors of a
musket or two when their term of servitude should expire. There
can be no doubt of this man's ultimate wealth, if he can secure
his life, but <i>that</i> is the question. As we passed a small
neat inclosure, I asked "What is that?" and he said "My partner's
grave, sir. He was shot there, where he is buried, nine months
ago, by some of the hill natives who had laid an ambush for him,
and shot him as he walked along the path where we now stand." I
asked why they shot him; and the reply was, "They owed him a
grudge for something or other", and I did not care to press the
question, as it was evidently not an agreeable one, and the
matter had been settled before my arrival. When we reached his
small wooden house, principally built of planks obtained from the
labour vessels, and guarded by an outside fence to stop a rush,
he stepped in before and gave me a hearty welcome; and I sat and
talked awhile with this strange solitary man. Loaded guns hung
round the room, and the pistols in his belt showed that he was
ready for any emergency. He told me that he could obtain as many
native labourers as he pleased, without recourse to kidnapping,
and that he always returned them to their homes at the expiration
of a year's service. His chief difficulty was from the hill
natives of the island, who, he said, would attack him without any
provocation, but he was doing his best to conciliate them. He was
reticent as to his former life; but if report spoke truth, it had
been a wild and wicked one. However there was no special charge
against him, and I left him, feeling admiration for his
indomitable pluck, although of a vagabond kind. On the following
day we anchored in Port Resolution, when, accompanied by thirty
seamen, we made an excursion to Tanna Volcano, led by guides
provided by the missionaries. For the first five or six miles our
road led through thick forest, where the interlacing branches of
the trees formed a screen, that the tiniest sun ray could not
filter through. Now and then we came to openings where the sky
and a blaze of sunshine broke in at once, that seemed to blind
us, and were glad to plunge into shade and dusk again. The ground
soon began to grow warm under our feet in these openings; it was
spongy and grassy, and steam was breaking out in many small jets.
In bare places it was too hot to touch with the hand. We emerged
quite suddenly on a broad barren space, covered with ashes and
scoriae, from which a bare cone-shaped hill rose abruptly for
five or six hundred feet, with a crater at its summit, which
seemed to be about two miles in circumference. We had heard the
roar of the volcano miles away; but the sight was sudden, and we
stood awe-struck for some moments, contemplating this great power
of nature at work. The crater belched incessant smoke and flame;
and at short intervals great masses of stone were shot high into
the tormented air, and came down with heavy thuds. We resolved to
climb to the edge of the crater, and with a fresh trade-wind
blowing an ascent of the weather side is tolerably safe; but the
wind happened now to be light and variable, and our guides were
doubtful. A native chief told us not to run when we saw stones
falling, but to stand and watch them, and jump aside as needful;
and this we did, and spread ourselves out in skirmishing order to
face the cannonade of white-hot stones, some of them large enough
to crush an elephant, that fell amongst us. The men lit pipes, or
cooked a biscuit on some of these stones. Finding it too exciting
to be pleasant, we went streaming round the rim of the crater to
what seemed the safer side. On one edge the descent of the cone
lay below us, blasted and bare, and covered with scoriae; at the
other the crater went down, and we, marching on the narrow rim
between, with our figures relieved by the leaden sky, looked not
unlike what Dante might have conceived of a company of lost souls
being marshalled to hell. At this side we stood with some safety
to watch the ways of the volcano. For a moment we could look down
into the vast pit, and see the vent-holes two hundred feet below
three of the largest full of a red-hot seething mass, mixed with
flame, and streaked with black, till the smoke gushed out and
obscured all, rolling up in volumes of tender grey colour, that
seemed almost to woo us to throw ourselves on their soft
convolutions and float upwards. Then a roar would come widening
up from the abyss, filling the ears with stupendous sound, the
flame burst out afresh, and the volley of stones shoot high into
the air, fall with a rattle and thud, and all be clear again.</p>
<p>There is a small lake at the north-east side of the mountain,
which communicates by an underground fissure with the volcano. It
is a shallow dead sea, with arid banks at one side and rich
vegetation on the other. Here we rested, and a number of Tanna
women having found out our retreat, we prevailed on them, by
promises of tobacco and beads, to give us one of their monotonous
song dances.</p>
<p>We returned to the ship through a valley, richly cultivated by
the natives, and found work awaiting us in the settlement of some
disputes between a white man and some natives, which prevented
our sailing that evening, as we had intended.</p>
<p>On Monday 9th we arrived at Aneiteum, the southernmost of the
New Hebrides Isles; and on the 12th at Numea, the French
settlement in New Caledonia, having, by the goodness of
Providence, safely visited fifty-three islands in the course of
our cruise, amidst many anxieties; much of the navigation having
been unknown, and our constant intercourse with the natives
having demanded unceasing effort. We met our orders from the
commodore here, and, in accordance with them, sailed after three
days' stay, for Sydney, which we reached on the early morning of
September 24th, and dropped anchor in the friendly waters of the
harbour.</p>
<p>On arriving, we found ourselves under orders from the
Admiralty to proceed again to Torres Straits and the coast of New
Guinea, for a period of four, afterwards changed to six months.
We had gone through nine months of tropical service and ceaseless
work; but the health of the ship's company was good, and the ship
(some refitting being done) was available, so we turned ourselves
from thoughts of rest, and set to work to make preparations for
the cruise.</p>
<p>Our stay at Sydney was longer eventually than we expected, for
a strike amongst the operatives delayed the caulking of the
"Basilisk".</p>
<p>In the meantime the kidnapping Act of 1872 had come into
force, and we were thus prepared to deal effectively with the
kidnapping and South Sea Island labour questions, which were to
occupy an important place in the forthcoming cruise.</p>

<p><small>ON</small> Sunday, December 8, we left Sydney bound on
our second Torres Straits cruise, with permission to visit the
coast of New Guinea, and went slowly north with a tumbling sea
and a fresh breeze.</p>
<p>On the 17th we had a cheering meeting with Lord and Lady
Normanby at Brisbane, who both took a deep interest in our
labours, past and future. I informed the governor and Mr. Palmer
that the principal object of the cruise was to put down illegal
practices in connection with the pearl-shelling in Torres
Straits, and that I was directed to make inquiries as to the fate
or condition of Mr. Miklucko Macklay, the eminent Russian
traveller in New Guinea, who has explored so much of its northern
shores, as he had been for some time lost to sight, and it was
feared he had perished. I also fully explained to them that
during the performance of these and the routine duties of the
cruise, opportunities might occur for our rendering special
services to the colony, and that I was prepared to take advantage
of such to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>Much of the navigation of Torres Straits was still unknown,
and not only were they now becoming a frequent resort of merchant
ships, but it was actually in contemplation to run the line of
mail steamers between Brisbane and Singapore through them. It was
therefore of the last importance to throw as much light as
possible on their many dangers, and to indicate a safe
navigation, and the position of suitable anchorages where such
might exist. This I was ready to do by surveying, whenever time
and means lay at my disposal.</p>
<p>Lord Normanby and the Queensland Government cordially accepted
my offer of rendering such service, if possible, in the course of
duty, and at my request allowed Navigating-Lieutenant Connor,
R.N., a good surveyor, to accompany us in the "Basilisk". I had
made attempts to get a surveyor at Sydney, and failed; so it was
with much satisfaction that I received Mr. Connor in the capacity
of "passenger", and stowed him away in my side cabin.</p>
<p>We reached Cardwell on January 2d, in a heavy gale,
accompanied by thick weather, and anchored under the lee of Gould
Island, whilst I ran in, in the galley, to gain information from
Mr. Sheridan, the Police Magistrate. I found from him that the
pearl-shellers had received warning that the new kidnapping act,
which rendered the employment of natives illegal, without
license, had come into force, and that they knew of the
"Basilisk's" coming, and were clearing out of the Straits as fast
as possible, on which I determined to make all haste north. On
the 5th we chased and overhauled two schooners, the "Melanie",
with fifty-five, and the "Challenge", with thirty-three South Sea
Islanders on board, who had been employed as divers in Torres
Straits. These schooners had been warned of the passing of the
new Act by the Marquis of Normanby himself, who had visited the
Straits some months previously, but they had stayed on to the
last moment, and attempting to escape on hearing of our approach,
had fallen into our clutches.</p>
<p>Each individual case of the islanders on board needed
investigation, so we anchored with our prizes off Fitzroy Island,
where the good anchorage was very welcome. The result of our
examination was to bring out the facts that in the "Melanie"
fourteen natives had been from four to six years, fourteen from
three to four years, and one for one year, working without any
wages beyond their necessary clothing and tobacco, and that no
agreement had been made with them. Seventeen stated that they had
shipped from their island on board another vessel from three to
four years ago, and had since been transferred, against the wish
of the majority, to the "Melanie", and kept at work without any
agreement; the rest were on the ship's books as having been
legally shipped at Sydney. The stories of these men were various;
most of them had shipped voluntarily&mdash;seven had been
kidnapped. "Captain gammon me&mdash;say I go back&mdash;I never
go back", said one poor fellow; and two others had the same tale,
"Captain gammon me". Another had been seized from a reef; two had
been run down in their canoe by a schooner named the "Maria
Renny", and taken on board.</p>
<p>To secure themselves from the penalties of the new Act, the
pearl-shellers had induced these natives to sign an agreement to
serve them for five months from August, and had fixed wages for
them.</p>
<p>This analysis is a fair sample, and will give an idea of the
then average state of affairs. We sent the vessels as prizes to
Sydney, where they were condemned; but on a subsequent appeal to
the Privy Council, the highest appeal court for the colonies, the
vessels were restored, on paying all costs connected with the
case, on the grounds that retrospective evidence could not be
entertained, and that an intention to procure a license had been
proved.</p>
<p>Whilst here investigating, our men had a good opportunity of
enjoying themselves on shore, bathing, washing clothes, and
hauling the seine; and the natives of both our prizes did us a
good turn by cleaning the ship's bottom right up from the keel.
It was quite a sight to see them, some eighty in number, swimming
round the ship armed with scrubbing brushes, laughing and
gesticulating, some disappearing every moment from the surface,
to re-appear far below as shadowy undulating forms along the
sheathing, where they were busy scrubbing off the grass and
barnacles from the copper in the most systematic manner. As they
reappeared they always gave vent to a clear, soft, whistle, which
seemed to come from an involuntary effort of the lungs. They
stayed a very short time two or three minutes&mdash;on the
surface, when they come up for air, and dived again as fresh as
ever; and in about an hour and a half made the ship's bottom as
clean as if she had been in dock.</p>
<p>On January 8th we continued our passage to Cape York, and next
day boarded the barque "Woodbine". Her men were suffering
dreadfully from scurvy, and our officers contributed with much
liberality from their stores to help them. Finding that this ship
had no articles, that she had twenty tons of pearl-shell on
board, the result of coloured labour, and three South Sea
Islanders without a license, and that the master could give no
explanation, I sent this vessel to Brisbane in charge of
Lieutenant S.G. Smith, where she was eventually released for want
of sufficient evidence.</p>
<p>Our first penny reading on board H.M.S. "Basilisk"&mdash;a
forerunner of many pleasant gatherings&mdash;came off on the
evening of Tuesday 14th, and was a perfect success, owing to the
organising talent of Lieutanants Hayter and Sydney Smith; and I
was truly glad at the outset of this cruise to find that such a
fund of amusement lay ready to be drawn on to beguile the tedium
of the work before us. All experience goes to prove that every
effort to vary the monotony of ship life is rewarded by increased
efficiency; it is in the nature of things that it should be
so.</p>
<p>On the 14th we boarded the barque "Crishna" of Sydney, and
found that she had thirty-five South Sea Islanders on board,
whose history was so similar to that of the "Melanie" natives
that I need not relate it. We sent her to Brisbane, where she was
condemned, and sold for &pound;3900, with her cargo, intelligence
of which was very cheering to the ship's company. This amount has
since been heavily cut down by law expenses, and the Imperial
Government has claimed half the remainder.</p>
<p>Wishing to clear up doubt as to the existence or non-existence
of a river reported at the bottom of Lloyd's Bay, we stood in and
anchored near Low Island on the evening of the 15th. The chart at
this point is marked, "apparent opening of large river"; and it
will be seen, by a glance at the map of North Queensland, that a
river would be a rich gift of nature here, as affording an
opening into the country, and a highway for the transit of
agricultural produce. Navigating-Lieutenant Connor and I, in the
galley, and Mr. Mourilyan in the gig, came to an anchor
accordingly, off the supposed entrance of the river, at 11
<small>P.M</small>., and spreading our awnings and making
ourselves as comfortable as we could for the night, we drank off
a dose of quinine every man, and turned over to sleep. It was a
hot calm moonlight night, and my companions were soon breathing
measuredly. I had a lantern in the stern gratings, and enjoyed to
the full the rare pleasure of a little quiet reading and thought.
At daybreak we began our search for the river, and explored one
salt-water creek after another; but each was a failure, and led
only to entanglement in the swamp, where clouds of mosquitoes
resented our invasion of their holds. There was no river. The
drainage of a hill-range, six or seven miles inland, had created
a swamp of many miles extent, covered with mangroves and
intersected by these salt-water creeks; and this was all. Finding
a piece of sandy beach, we breakfasted there with all
willingness, for river-hunting is very hungry work, and returning
to the ship, got under weigh directly.</p>
<p>The heat now began to be very trying, 90&deg; on deck, under
the awnings. We knew that the "Basilisk" had earned a bad
reputation for herself as a sickly ship during former commissions
in the West Indies, and a letter from a former commander had
warned me of this. It struck me that the cause might be in the
isolation of the engine-room, which was shut in by strong
bulk-heads, right across the ship, at both ends, thus preventing
a free circulation of air. To remedy this we cut a large scuttle
about four feet square between the lower deck and the foremost
stoke-hole, and the result was a success, particularly under
steam, when the rush of cold air to the furnaces was such as to
make the lower, or troop-deck, one of the coolest places in the
ship. To this simple measure, and the allowance of a free tank
for all purposes, I principally attribute the marvellous
healthiness of the ship during the years of tropical work we went
through. During the period of our service we did not lose a man
from sickness, our total of deaths being two from accident, and
one at Sydney from rapid consumption. On the whole, I am of
opinion that the health of a ship's company can be kept up to the
normal standard during exposure to intense heat and a rainy
season, if incessant precaution is taken; clothing lightened to a
bearable degree; cleanliness and ventilation attended to; food
made as nourishing and various as may be; extra allowances of
non-stimulating drinks issued to repair the waste caused by
continual perspirations; leave given on shore whenever possible,
and as much wholesome amusement provided on board as
circumstances will allow.</p>
<p>On January 18th we took up our old anchorage off Somerset, and
saw the anchor go down with different feelings from those of last
year. Then, its plunge marked our work as complete, now Cape York
was but a starting-point for arduous work. Mr. Jardine welcomed
us, and gave us the benefit of all his information; and the next
day, Sunday, was spent as a day of rest&mdash;Mr. Murray, the
missionary, conducting our service on board. This gentleman had
been absent from England on mission work for thirty-five years,
without once returning, and had been instrumental in sowing the
seeds of Christianity in very many islands.</p>
<p>The rainy season had now commenced, and we suffered the
inconvenience of a constant downpour&mdash;a serious one in a
flush-decked vessel. Our rain awnings, too, were insufficient,
lacing inside the bulwarks to the deck, instead of outside.
Whilst here we fell in with a lonely waif of society, named
Cockerill, who has betaken himself to live in a tiny vessel of
about eight tons, and accompanied only by his son and two
natives, cruises about these seas as a naturalist, and seems to
be happy enough in his own way. His boat was laden with specimens
of beautiful birds; and from the Aru Islands, 500 miles west of
Somerset, which he had just left, he had brought some boxes full
of the Great Bird of Paradise, and the still more exquisite King
Bird of Paradise, of which he kindly gave me a specimen. This
bird, only lately becoming known at home, is as large as a small
thrush, the back glossy crimson, the head feathers being soft,
and deep in tone like velvet, the throat crimson, and separated
from the pure white breast by a wide band of green. It has the
long wire tail of all Birds of Paradise, terminating, however, in
two circular feathers, about the size of a sixpenny piece, of a
burnished green. But its peerless ornaments are two small feather
fans of intense emerald colour, set in the upper joint of the
wing, and capable of being spread or folded at pleasure.</p>
<p>We had now a period of six weeks before us, to be spent in
Torres Straits and on the coast of New Guinea, at the end of
which time we were to return to Somerset and take in the coal and
stores which would then await us there. The duty assigned us had
been to put down all illegal practices against Polynesians in
these waters, and having succeeded in doing this, I desired to
make the most of the time at our disposal by rendering what
hydrographical service should be possible. By a late Act of
government, all islands, lying within sixty miles of the shores
of Queensland, had been declared British possessions, and this
Act had brought the Australian boundary to within twenty miles of
New Guinea. It was thus important that something should be known
of the navigation between.</p>
<p>On Friday, 24th, we left Somerset, after four hours'
difficulty in weighing the anchor and getting clear, for the ship
was whirled round and round in cross currents at such a rate that
the chains kept continually fouling, and we lost both flukes of
our best bower anchor before we could extricate ourselves. We
anchored that night near Saddle Island, and next morning
proceeded through an unsurveyed portion of the Straits to
Brothers Island, surveying as we went; whilst
Navigating-Lieutenant Connor laid down a line of soundings in a
different course between these two islands. On our return to the
Brothers, we saw seven large boats belonging to the vessels we
had captured in Torres Straits, hauled up under orders not to
work till their owners had obtained license to fish.</p>
<p>On Sunday we found a clear deep water channel on our way west
to Jarvis Island, thirty miles from the Brothers, till on coming
close to the island, and reaching a supposed clear patch of
surveyed water, we struck, and remained fast on a sandy knoll.
All were at their posts; so, vexatious as it was, we had the
consolation of feeling that we had gone ashore, strictly
according to Act of Parliament. It was ebb tide, and we ran out
an anchor and cable astern, got the guns aft, and waited the
flow, when the old ship floated off much to our joy, unharmed. A
ship is never safe in Torres Straits when out of the beaten
track, the lurking dangers are so many. The changes made during
heavy gales in the shape of rapid shifts and accumulations of
sand, defy calculation; added to which the sea is so discoloured
by the New Guinea rivers flowing down, that such dangers are made
imperceptible. Jarvis is a lofty volcanic island, 525 feet high,
and about fifty-five miles from Cape York, and is within the line
of British possessions, and the headquarters of three pearl
shelling stations. We were anxious to make a survey of the
anchorage, so next morning Lieutenant Connor and some of our
officers began to survey it, and after three days' arduous
labour, proved it to be a valuable harbour, protected by the
island and surrounding coral reefs, having sufficient water for
large vessels, but tides of great strength. This harbour we named
Philip Harbour, and were glad to find it so available, as it will
always be a main resort of the pearl shelling industry. The space
of thirty-six miles which lies between Jarvis Island and the low
mangrove-covered coast of New Guinea is a mass of coral reefs,
and contains no passage for ships, and scarcely any for boats.
Thus all the passages by which ships can enter Torres Straits lie
between Jarvis Island and Cape York, and are now British waters.
These passages are very narrow, under two miles in width; whilst
the one most generally taken the Prince of Wales's Channel,
between Hammond Island and the north-west reef is barely a mile
and a half wide. We hold this great highway of the ocean
therefore on the best strategic terms. The average depth of water
in these channels is only seven or eight fathoms, and a few
torpedoes judiciously placed would effectually block up this
route to an enemy.</p>
<p>The natives of Jarvis Island are black Papuans, quite
uncivilised and unclothed. At their village I saw signs of a
custom which will perhaps one day puzzle the naturalist. The huts
were pitched under the shelter of some enormous banyan trees, in
the massive trunks of which the bones of the dugong were so
deeply imbedded as to seem one with the wood. Looking farther, I
saw that many tender shoots, just drooping to root themselves,
were twined round the bones of freshly killed dugong. They are
placed thus as a propitiatory offering, and are never removed.
The large teeth and ribs of the dugong are ivory of an inferior
sort, and doubtless give the unfortunate animal a market value
that will lead to its speedy extinction.</p>

<p><small>WE</small> sailed for Cornwallis Island on the 30th,
but were soon obliged to anchor under the lee of a coral reef,
the weather became so thick and dirty. On the 31st we crossed an
unknown part of the Straits, supposed to be closed by coral, to
reach an anchorage between two large islands. One&mdash;Mount
Cornwallis, once believed to be an integral part of New Guinea,
is high and healthy land; the other, which we placed on the chart
last year by its native name of Saibai, is low ground, and
probably malarious. Cautiously we picked our way through these
dangerous waters, often with only a few feet of water to spare
under our keel, and reached our desired anchorage off Cornwallis,
late in the afternoon. This island, which lies about five miles
from the New Guinea coast, is lofty, rising to a height of 790
feet, rugged, covered with huge granite boulders, and in part
with dark green trees. On its north-eastern side lie some fine
patches of grassy land, well supplied with fresh water, and a
richly cultivated valley, producing taro and melons; and here the
village and native mission station are placed, but the native
houses are only occasionally occupied, as the natives live on
Saibai, three miles to the eastward. I visited Saibai with
Lieutenant Hayter, Dr. Goodman, and other officers, and found it
a low island, about twelve miles long by three broad, having a
large brackish lagoon within, which abounds with curlew, wild
duck, and other wild fowl. The northern shores are cultivated,
and produce abundance of yams and other roots, cocoa-nuts and
fruits&mdash;the rest of the island is swampy, and covered with
mangroves. Saibai is well populated, and the principal village
contains about 600 inhabitants. The houses are well sized, and
two stories high the latter a peculiarity not elsewhere seen by
us. These houses are built on poles in the ordinary way; the
upper room is used as the better chamber and sleeping place, and
the lower, which is formed by thatching in the poles, as a
store-room for weapons and fishing-gear. The sleeping place
contains some rude mats on which to lie at night, and is reached
by the simplest of ladders&mdash;a piece of notched wood. Human
skulls are suspended round the houses, but the people are not
cannibals; they have plenty of vegetables and fish, of pigs, in
which the island abounds, and a supply of turtle and the flesh of
the dugong, which is very good eating, and tastes rather like
veal. The canoes are large, and made of a single tree dug out, to
which washboards are lashed on with cocoa-nut fibre, and head and
stern pieces of wood, that are fitted to meet them. They have
very long outriggers, and on either side a platform, on which
wicker cages are fixed to hold weapons. They carry two mat sails
on shifting poles, and are frequently ornamented by a short pole
at the stem, with a bunch of grass floating from it, and picked
out prettily with ochres, and devices burnt out. The weapons used
here are iron tomahawks, bows, and arrows barbed with wallaby
bones, and poisoned, which are said to cause convulsions and
rapid death. The people, who are tall and muscular, are jet
black; their eyes are brown, and very lustrous, and they have
good noses and mouths, the former sometimes inclining to the
aquiline, and a facial angle of about sixty-five degrees. The
head, which is well shaped, is covered with crisp woolly
hair.</p>
<p>The women wear their hair cut close, except a narrow ridge
from ear to ear, which is left under an inch long. Many of the
men cut theirs quite close, and wear wigs made of matting, with
narrow ringlets fastened in so closely, that for some time we
thought them the natural hair. They go nearly quite unclothed.
Polygamy is general amongst the natives of the Torres Straits
Islands, and the crime of infanticide prevails. The principal
diseases are fever and ague, for which they bleed the sufferer
freely from the forehead, back, and limbs, with flints. Ulcerated
mosquito bites are frequent, and some few cases of hydrocele and
elephantiasis have been seen. These last remarks I make on the
authority of Navigating-Lieutenant Connor, who spent many weeks
in surveying amongst these islands.</p>
<p>Having finished our inquiries at Saibai, we left this zealous
volunteer behind, with Mr. Pitt, midshipman, and four men, in the
pinnace, and a fine whaleboat, lent us by Mr. Jardine, manned by
five of our best seamen, to survey these newly known islands, and
the opposite coast of New Guinea, and sailed ourselves for the
eastern islands of Torres Straits, and the New Guinea coast 300
miles east of this point. As we passed out of sight of Mr.
Connor's boats, an anxious feeling filled my breast&mdash;there
were so many chances possible against his safety and
success&mdash;quarrels with the natives, sickness, sudden gales,
and dangerous navigation; but I had full confidence in his
prudence and seamanship.</p>
<p>On February 4th we called at Warrior Island, where we found
that Mr. Bedford had been succeeded at his post by a worn-out
sailor, who seemed very incapable. Pearl-shelling had ceased, and
thirty-two South Sea islanders were waiting in idleness till
their masters could procure licenses to fish. It came on to blow
hard, with a confused, dangerous sea, and we had some difficulty
in communicating. Next day we steered through Basilisk Pass, and
anchored off the low coral shore of Cocoa Nut Island, where a
Scotchman has recently established a pearl-shell fishery. The
fishers in his employment have more decent dwelling-places than
those at other pearl-shelling stations. They close in a small
square of white coral sand with a light fence, trample it hard,
and build two oblong huts with sticks, and thatching, in opposite
corners, about four feet high, and ten long by eight feet wide,
leaving a small hole for a door in each, large enough to admit a
man's body. The natives in these parts are not able to supply
visitors with any refreshments, neither is there any water on
this island, which has a population consisting of nearly 150
souls, and all the water used has to be brought from Sue Island,
about fifteen miles distant, in large hollow bamboos.</p>
<p>Friday, 8th, found us at the mountainous Darnley Isle,
situated at the eastern entrance of Torres Straits, past the
region of pearl-shell, but the headquarters of the
b&ecirc;che-de-mer fisheries. It is now generally known that
b&ecirc;che-de-mer is a large sea slug, and is found left in
large quantities on the coral-reefs by the receding tide, falling
an easy prey to the fishers. The slugs are cut open, cleaned, and
placed on thin iron plates in a smoke-drying room, where, after
being thoroughly dried, they are packed and sorted for the
Chinese market. The b&ecirc;che-de-mer is divided into three
qualities. The best, called the Red Fish, is worth &pound;140 per
ton at Sydney; the second, or Black Fish, &pound;120; and the
worst, or Teat Fish, about &pound;80; and as slugs are plentiful
on the reefs the trade is a lucrative one.</p>
<p>The natives here are tall, well-built men, quick in
understanding, able to drive a bargain with Europeans, and good
cultivators of the soil. This is the only island in Torres
Straits on which sago palms grow. They are to be found here in a
well-watered glen, where their emerald-plated trunks, furnished
far down with great feathery branches, form a pleasing contrast
to the tall bare-stemmed cocoa-nut trees with their top-heavy
crowns. The inhabitants treat their dead precisely in the manner
of the Capuchin Friars of Sicily, save that they dry the body in
the sun instead of in an oven. When fully hardened, the ghastly
object is placed recumbent in a deserted dwelling-house. I shall
not easily forget our disgust, when, seeing one of the pretty
well-thatched oval houses standing in a thick grove of palm and
fruit trees, we went to it, expecting to be met by the usual
group of dark, plump, bright-eyed children, and found instead
silence and rank vegetation round the door, and inside two
shrivelled corpses. This is the only island where I have seen
this custom practised in all these seas.</p>
<p>Having transacted our fishing business, and given the native
teachers some biscuit and beef, we sailed for a solitary
sand-cay, about thirty miles distant&mdash;a noted resort of
turtle&mdash;as we were anxious to give the men some fresh meals.
When half-way there our paddle-wheel sustained a shock, and we
perceived that it had struck an enormous basking turtle. The
creature was wide awake now, and lay on its back, flapping
violently till we had secured it. The weight was 472 lbs., and it
proved to be the Luth, or Leathery Turtle, so called from the
soft leathery plates, similar in appearance to the armour of an
ironclad, with which it is covered. This specimen was a small
one, for they are known to attain a length of nine feet and a
weight of 1600 lbs. Naturalists say that its flesh is hurtful,
and causes many symptoms of poisoning in those who eat it, but
this one afforded all hands nearly two good meals, and no harm
resulted, the only fault found being that its flavour was
somewhat fishy.</p>
<p>On the 11th, after visiting the Murray Islands, we left Torres
Straits and stood across the Gulf of Papua for Redscar Bay, about
200 miles distant, on the east New Guinea coast, to visit the
mission station established there, where the missionaries were
said to be sick and half-starving, and to gain kidnapping
information. Some large rivers were reported to exist in this
neighbourhood, and we determined to explore sufficiently to make
sure.</p>
<p>We had quite an alarm at daybreak on the 13th, for the officer
of the watch reported "reefs right ahead, and close to!" and sure
enough there appeared to be long lines of reef stretching away in
patches as far as the eye could see, the nearest within 100 yards
of the ship. Fuller light, however, showed that they were not
reefs, but collections of huge trees which some flood in the New
Guinea rivers had torn from their banks and swept thirty miles
out to sea; and showed us also the magnificent Owen Stanley range
purple against the sky.</p>
<p>This part of the coast was partially surveyed by Captain Owen
Stanley in 1849, but landing was but once attempted by his party,
as the natives were believed to be dangerous.</p>
<p>Anchoring in Redscar Bay, we pulled for four miles over a
dangerous shallow flat, formed by the alluvial deposit of the
rivers which empty themselves through the Towton-Opening at the
head of this bay; and passing through the opening entered a
splendid expanse of inland water which appeared to be about three
miles wide, and showed no limit as to its length, except where a
wooded islet intercepted our view to the north-east. It seemed to
offer a promising water way to the interior of the island, and we
resolved to explore it, but our first object was to visit the
starving native teachers at Redscar village. We pulled in for the
village, where crowds of natives were anxiously watching and
waiting for us, beached our boats amongst a crowd of canoes
hauled up on the black sandy beach, and stepped on shore amongst
our new friends, who, wholly unarmed, and without a sign of
distrust, gave us a hearty welcome. We were surprised to see that
these people differed totally from the tall, muscular,
fierce-looking, naked black Papuans we had left in Torres
Straits. These men were more of the Malay type&mdash;small,
lithe, copper-coloured people, with clean well-cut features, and
a pleasing expression of countenance. They wore their own hair,
frizzled out mop-fashion, and were slightly tattooed with stars
and small figures, on the breast and shoulders, as I have never
seen the black Papuans. They had nothing in the way of clothes
but a sort of leaf girdle. The young men were ornamented with
white cowrie shells, bound round their foreheads, arms, and legs,
and bird of Paradise and Cassowary plumes, on their heads and
shoulders; the older appeared to dispense with these adornments.
The septum of the nose and lobes of the ear were pierced, and
tortoise-shell rings, pieces of bamboo or shell put through. The
women were ill-made and slovenly-looking as compared with the
men; their dress was the "Ti-ti" or grass petticoat; but the
otherwise nude body was adorned by the most extensive tattooing,
so well executed as to excite the admiration of all amongst us
who had not seen the exquisite tattooing of the Japanese. The
village is built on low swampy ground, from which the mangroves
have been cleared, and numbers about one hundred houses, raised
on poles of the unusual height of fifteen and twenty feet,
probably for safety in case the river should overflow its low
banks, and also to lift them somewhat above the range of the
vicious mosquitoes that blacken the air in these swampy places.
Some of the houses are thirty or forty feet in length, and not
more than ten feet broad, and look like long narrow passages
inside. The entrance is at the gable end, where there is a large
bamboo platform before the door, which forms a pleasant chatting
place, or cool seat for the family at meals. At the other
extremity a small space is divided off by bamboo poles into one
or two small compartments, which we supposed to be intended as
sleeping places for the girls. The little children were all
dressed like their elders of either sex, and did not fear us in
the least as we walked about, but played round us, shooting with
small bows and arrows.</p>
<p>Our visit was short, for on reaching the mission hut we found
three teachers so near death's door that Dr. Haines requested me
to send them on board the "Basilisk" immediately, as the only
chance of saving their lives. They had little or no food, and it
needed but a look round on the low malarious country to make sure
that any but aboriginal natives must be visited more or less by
disease here. These three poor creatures, who were without any
necessary medicines, were carried by our men to my boat, and
placed under a canvas screen on deck, to be treated by the
skilful hands of Drs. Goodman and Haines, and their wives were
brought on board and made comfortable in my side cabin.</p>
<p>On Friday, 14th, the gunner and I in the galley, and Mr.
Hayter and Dr. Haines in the gig, left, the ship to ascend, if
possible, one of the rivers debouching here, to its home in the
mountains of Stanley Range, the nearest peak of which is not more
than twenty miles from the flat belt of low country bordering
here on the sea. We called first at the Towton village and
induced one of the native teachers to go with us as pilot, and
then, with a fair breeze aiding us against the strong downward
current, we passed up the wide estuary, named by us Galley Reach,
which is formed here by the confluence of many streams which fall
into it, and escape to the sea by the Towton-Opening.</p>
<p>We regretted as we crossed it that no navigable passage
connects it with the sea, for such a passage would make it one of
the finest harbours in the world. Instead of proceeding to the
head of Galley Reach we made for the mouth of a fine stream which
lay to the right, about three miles above the Towton or Redscar
village, afterwards named by us Usborne River. Our pilot told us
that it led to the home of a warlike tribe about fifteen miles
distant, and added that the coast villagers were much afraid of
this tribe. I determined to meet and gain the friendship of these
people if possible, and obtain their concurrence in an attempt to
reach the interior; but my time was short, as my orders obliged
me to be at Cape York in three weeks' time, and I was anxious,
after exploring these rivers falling into Galley Reach, to
examine the almost unknown coast of New Guinea farther to the
eastward, the outline of which had been traced from a distance by
Captain Owen Stanley, R.N., twenty-five years before, and had
never since been visited by white men.</p>
<p>The river now entered by us had a rapid current, and was from
100 to 120 yards broad, with an average depth of twelve feet. The
banks were composed of black fetid mud, from which sprang tall,
melancholy, mangrove trees, ranking their bare thin trunks so
closely together that it was difficult to pass between them,
whilst their dank foliage mingled seventy or eighty feet overhead
in a mass of darkness. We frequently landed, and strove to
penetrate this slimy mangrove forest, in the hope of reaching
some clear ground; but after many efforts, much slipping off the
mangrove roots deep into the slime, and much startling of little
red and brown crabs, lizards, snakes, and other ugly creatures in
their happy homes, we had to return to the boats without success.
On one of these occasions, seeing a serpent of the boa tribe
twined round the trunk of a tree, gorged, and fast asleep, we
shot it, and it quickened at once, and glared savagely at us,
till killed by repeated blows. The edge of these mangrove banks
was lined with a gigantic shrub, which, for want of better
knowledge, I call a Bastard Palm; it has no trunk, but sends up
great leaf-branches of a palm shape, each thirty or forty feet
long, that arch over the stream at a height of five or six feet.
A small species of the same kind was armed on the edge of its
leaves with sharp strong hooks, and these bending low over the
water, often cruelly lacerated our flesh, as we were obliged to
keep close under the banks to avoid the strong current. By four
o'clock in the afternoon, we had reached a distance of ten miles
above the Towton village, without having come to any break in the
mangrove swamp. At last, when we had almost ceased to expect a
change, we were cheered by seeing the banks rise a little, after
which a grassy glade soon showed itself, and we were speedily on
shore, with triangles rigged, and our dinners cooking over fine
wood fires, the smoke of which somewhat daunted the mosquitoes.
After dinner heavy tropical rain began to fall, but we struggled
manfully on under it, and against a fierce current, till
nightfall, and then anchoring in midstream prepared to pass the
night. We covered the boats in with rain awnings, changed our
clothes, and had an impromptu penny reading, with plenty of
songs. When ready for sleep we drank a dose of quinine, and
settled down for what we hoped would prove a quiet night. A
"quiet night"! if ever poor mortals suffered the torments of the
lost in a small way, we did. The air was thick with mosquitoes,
armed with stings that pierced us as easily as though we had only
been arrayed in the woad of our ancestors. They nearly drove us
into the water, and I had to caution the men continually to keep
their arms and legs on board for fear of the alligators.</p>
<p>We were glad to be at work again before daylight broke, and
slowly forcing our way up-stream, through a country which soon
revealed itself to sight, for the banks were now open, and broken
into undulations, so that we could see all kinds of huge palm,
and great bread-fruit trees, the lovely tree-fern, and trees
which we were not botanists enough to name, stretching away on
every side into seemingly interminable forest. Here and there we
observed a creeper of a rich, dark, green colour, climbing to the
top of the loftiest tree, and crushing the life out of its
support. This beautiful destroyer had quite killed some mighty
trees, and clung now to the dead branches, assuming all their
stark shapes. In other places it ran down and formed impenetrable
hedges seventy or eighty feet high, between which the river ran
like a deep ditch. The silence, but for our oars, was
unbroken&mdash;land and water seemed asleep&mdash;not a breeze
stirred, not a creature, man nor beast, appeared to peep at us,
or question our passage; but after a time the birds began to
awake with discordant screams. Parrots and cockatoos abounded, so
also did the great crowned pigeon, a specimen of which we shot,
but it fell into the jungle and was lost. Large white storks were
numerous, and other birds of kinds unknown to us, all unusually
wary, keeping to the highest branches of the lofty trees, out of
gunshot; but no animal was to be heard, and the birds soon
quieted down again. We breakfasted, and pushed on again against a
still increasing current, through which we made headway only by
continually shooting the stream from side to side, and gaining
the shelter of the projecting points; but it was difficult to
make progress, for huge snags and fallen trees impeded the
stream, and we had many narrow escapes from upset. The hills now
began to rise, and rocky knolls showed themselves occasionally,
and this cheered us to fresh exertions. We came to a place where
the river divides itself, and keeping to the main stream, found
ourselves in a grand, rapid river, twenty-five feet deep. I now
felt sure that such a volume of water must have a clear course
for many miles; but in one short mile we were brought to a
stand-still by a vast accumulation of fallen and uprooted trees,
swept down during ages from the mountains, which had completely
bridged the river, which is here about sixty feet wide. Rank
vegetation grew out of the decaying trunks, and several small
islets, formed of debris and alluvial matter, bound the mass
together. The river rushed furiously under, but could not sweep
away this barrier of its own creation. We made long and fruitless
efforts to find a way through, but as we had not time nor means
at our disposal to haul the boats overland and relaunch them, and
the current above appeared too strong for oars to contend with,
we had to give up, and unwillingly turn back. I would have given
much to have explored to the head of this river, and reached the
mountain range, and I hope that others will follow me here and
succeed, as river communication will be of the last importance in
opening up New Guinea.</p>
<p>We went down swiftly with the current, and reached Towton,
where I slept at the Mission-house, and the good Samoian teachers
made me most comfortable. There was but one apartment in the hut,
with separate spaces, screened off by tappa, and it rocked gently
on its long poles in the breeze, with the motion of a ship at
sea.</p>
<p>Disappointed in reaching the interior of New Guinea by this
stream, and in finding any trace of inland inhabitants, I
resolved to make another effort at the head of Galley Reach to
find a stream which should form an inland highway, but as the
examination of the coast to the east was more important, and it
was necessary for the "Basilisk" to call at Redscar again on her
way back to Cape York, I deferred this attempt till our return
from the eastward.</p>

MURRAY.</small></p>
<p><small>ON</small> Monday, 17th, Navigating-Lieutenant
Mourilyan and I started in the cutter and galley, well armed, and
taking a week's provisions, to examine the coast for fifty miles
to the eastward of Redscar Head. This coast had been surveyed by
the "Rattlesnake", outside the Barrier Reef, which was correctly
laid down, as also the general outline of the coast. But no
attempt had been made to survey inside the reef, and this
deficiency we desired to remedy.</p>
<p>Immediately to the east of Redscar Head, the outlying Barrier
Reef lifts itself to the surface, at a distance varying from
three to eight miles off shore, and guards the coast from the
surf. Simultaneously with its appearance the coast rises, and
precipitous round-topped grassy hills, openly timbered, and
backed up by higher ranges inside, spring from the white coral
and sandy beach. Between these hills fertile valleys lie, and
villages nestle, with groves of cocoa-nut trees surrounding them.
The houses are built in the Malay fashion, on poles, some
standing far out on the shore reefs, in quiet waters, others
clustering amongst plantations on the hill side. This change from
low mangrove swamp to fine hilly land is as refreshing to the
eye, weary with that dead sameness, as it is sudden. From Redscar
Head to Hood Point, a distance of seventy miles, not a stream was
to be seen falling into the sea. We found some trickling rivulets
and some water holes, but no clear running stream. The soil in
the valleys is of a black, peaty, spongy nature, which probably
absorbs the rain as it falls.</p>
<p>After examining a vast extent of unknown reefs, we landed the
first day to dine on Cliff Island, a flat coral rock covered with
grass, and a few bushes and trees, and Mr. Mourilyan shot the two
solitary inhabitants, a pigeon and a jungle fowl. From this spot
as far as eye could see, the water inside the Barrier Reef
appeared to be blocked up by coral, eastward, but on continuing
our soundings, we found a fine deep water passage leading east
between these reefs and the mainland. Reaching an island, since
named by us Lily Island, Mr. Mourilyan in the cutter kept to the
deep water passage outside it, and I attempted to take the galley
between it and the island, and found that there is no inner
passage, as the island is joined to the mainland by long sandy
spits. We grounded opposite a large village, standing on poles,
far out in the clear blue water, and stretching back into the
verdure that climbed the undulating hills. The natives came off
at once, some in canoes, some wading, all unarmed, to the number
of about 100, and closed round us, with amazement in their faces,
but not a shade of fear. This was a new experience to us, for at
all the unchristianised islands we had visited, the natives had
been armed and on their guard. We were probably the first white
men seen by them, and their curiosity was so eager that our men
mistook it at first, and seized their arms; but I had noticed not
only that the natives were unarmed, but that their women and
children had all turned out on the beach to see us. I therefore
bid our men lay down their arms and welcome the New Guinea men as
friends&mdash;and friends the kindly creatures proved.</p>
<p>After they had handled us to their heart's content, we induced
them to track our boat through a narrow channel, and thus
rejoined the cutter. We then took a series of soundings from Lily
Island to Fisherman's Islets, which are of low sandy formation
and covered with scrub, which is the home of innumerable Torres
Straits pigeons. Here we supped on a delicious stew of these
birds, and then the boats, converted by their rain-awnings into
floating tents, were hauled off and anchored. The men lit their
pipes, and readings and songs followed, each boat trying to
outvie the other, till nine o'clock, when all lay down to sleep.
There were no mosquitoes, and it was a calm moonlight night, so
we slept like princes till half-past 5 <small>A.M</small>. Then
we landed, cooked breakfast, cleaned our arms, and had the usual
morning prayers, after which Mr. Mourilyan took the cutter to
examine a large bay in the mainland, to the north of Fisherman's
Islets, whilst I attempted to find a passage by which a ship
might pass through the Barrier Reef. From the boat I could see
nothing but a mass of reefs, so climbing the steep rugged sides
of Pyramid Point on the mainland, about eight miles from
Fisherman's Islets, I stood at the height of 643 feet above the
sea. From thence I could see, for miles on either side, every
coral patch that lay relieved by its clear pale green from the
blue of the deep water. The Barrier Reef stretched away like a
green ribbon floating on the sea, till lost to sight; its edge
fringed all along by a line of snow-white surf, that looked as
soft as down. At one point the ribbon was broken into two&mdash;a
piece of blue untroubled water lay between&mdash;and this I felt
would prove the entrance I sought. A group of small islets,
unmarked on the chart, lay just below us; so, turning to the fine
young seaman beside me, I asked him if he would wish them to bear
his name, and shall not easily forget his look of pleasure as he
assented. The islets accordingly appear in the chart as "Head
Islets". The whole scene was lovely; the sea was studded with
green islets, beautiful bays ran into the land, villages came
clustering down to the brink of the calm water, and running out
into the shallows, and the rich high land behind, closed in all
with its wooded hills, steeped in the glow of a vertical sun. I
made my notes, and descending, found my men on the best of terms
with a crowd of natives, who were bartering their feathers and
cocoa-nuts for beads. These people were perfectly harmless and
friendly, but we found out, after their leaving us, that they had
pilfered some small articles that were lying loose in the boat.
It was now too late to make use of the knowledge I had gained
from Pyramid Point, and I was tired out besides, so we supped on
our frequent fare of pigeons, and anchoring under the lee of a
newly found islet, were asleep as soon as our heads were laid
down.</p>
<p>Next morning saw us early astir, making for the hoped-for
entrance; and on reaching the spot we soon assured ourselves that
a passage did exist there, about three-quarters of a mile wide,
and bottomless as far as our lines went. With our boat's bows
resting on one horn of the reef, her stern was in deep water, so
perpendicularly does this coral wall rise from its ocean depths.
The cutter had gone to the bay to complete her survey, so we
joined her there, and Mr. Mourilyan met me with the news that an
opening existed at the head of the bay, which might lead to a
landlocked harbour. The bay itself was a reward for our labour,
as it formed a fine sheltered anchorage, but we earnestly desired
that our hope of finding a harbour here might be realised, as up
to this time the wild exposed anchorage of Redscar Bay had been
the only known shelter for ships on the entire south coast of New
Guinea, east of Torres Straits. We went at once to examine the
opening at the head of the bay, and to our delight found that it
was a deep water passage, leading into a broad sheet of calm
water, two miles by one and a-half in extent, deep enough nearly
everywhere to float the largest ship; and we resolved that the
"Basilisk" should be the first ship to honour the new harbour
with her presence. We landed on a wooded island, about 600 feet
high, at the head of the outer bay&mdash;since named by us Jane
Island&mdash;and found a fine well there, from which the natives
aided us to fill our water barricoes. They were as friendly as
possible; even the women and children thronged round us for
strings of red beads. We had come upon them in their "age of
stone", and they had no knowledge of the use of iron, which we
offered them; but they were willing to exchange their axes and
adzes, made of a kind of green stone, and set into curved wooden
handles, for our beads. By sunset we had regained our first
camping place on Fisherman's Islets, and there, after supper, and
reading and songs as usual, we betook ourselves to rest. Next
morning early we started for the ship, and were dismayed on
coming within five miles of her, to see her steaming out to sea.
After an hour's anxiety she saw us, and when we got on board we
found that Lieutenant Hayter had grown anxious, and was coming
down the coast to look for us.</p>
<p>The ship, where we met her, was surrounded by coral reefs, in
an open bay, and had barely water enough to float her, and this
so discoloured as to hide the reefs, we therefore gave it the
name of Caution Bay, as a warning to future navigators. We had an
anxious time in getting out of the bay, but Providence was good
to us, and we extricated ourselves at last, and proceeded for the
new harbour which all hands were anxious to see.</p>
<p>At ten o'clock on Friday morning, the "Basilisk" was off the
opening we had found in the reef, henceforth to be known as
Basilisk Passage, and from the foretop, whence every reef could
be seen, I conned her through the passage into the still waters
of Port Moresby to Jane Island, and past it into landlocked
many-bayed Fairfax Harbour, where we anchored in five fathoms
water. As we broke into these unknown waters I determined that
the outer and inner harbours should bear these names of my
father, the venerable admiral of the fleet.</p>
<p>Port Moresby, situated where coral and white sand has
succeeded the low mangrove-covered coast, lies in latitude 9&deg;
30' south, and longitude 147&deg; 10' east. The entrance is good,
and the land, which is covered with many trees, rises gently on
either side, to a considerable height. The inner, Fairfax
Harbour, is an irregular basin surrounded by round-topped grassy
hills, having the Australian gum-tree scattered over them, with
rich valleys between. The depth of water is from between seven
and four fathoms to within a few yards of the beach. The sides of
the hills are well cultivated, and yield abundance of yams and
taro.</p>
<p>We must have been a surprising sight to the natives, for they
flocked on board in hundreds, eager and curious, chattering like
monkeys, as they pointed out to each other the marvels that took
their fancy.</p>
<p>Mr. Mourilyan and I now began to make a survey of the harbour,
and Lieutenant Hayter went away with the galley and a fresh crew
to continue our exploration inside the Barrier Reef, for forty
miles east of Port Moresby to Hood's Point, where the barrier
reef curves in and joins the mainland, forming a
<i>cul-de-sac</i>.</p>
<p>A singular feature in this hilly country, intersected by deep
valleys, is the almost total absence of running water. The soil
is very porous, and the streams probably take an underground
course till they reach the mangrove swamps, in which the valleys
abutting on Fairfax Harbour terminate.</p>
<p>We went to visit one of the hill villages in the afternoon,
going quite unarmed, such was our confidence in the people, and
climbing a steep hillside sprinkled with gum trees, and covered
with granite boulders and quartz, found ourselves overlooking a
rich tropical valley, and saw the village on the opposite
hillside amongst abundant trees. The thin rocky soil gave place
as we began to descend the slope, to rich dark mould, from which
grass sprang nearly shoulder high, varied with occasional clumps
of splendid hard wood, tropical trees, and groups of the sago
palm. Here and there spaces, some three acres in extent, were
enclosed by stiff bamboo fences, and produced bananas, yams, and
taro in profusion, although no effort seemed to be made to keep
the weeds under. The bananas, which were nearly ripe, were tied
up in leaves to save them from the flying foxes.</p>
<p>The village consisted of about six houses, built on poles, and
looking as if they were marching out from amongst the trees on
stilts. The houses, which consisted of one room as usual, were
tenanted below, in the space between the poles, by pigs and
wretched looking dogs, that kept up an eager fight for the pieces
of broken cocoa-nut that had fallen from above to their share.
The villagers gave us a few stone clubs and wooden spears in
exchange for our bottles and beads, but would not look at our
iron-hoop and axes. They were not nearly so much adorned with
feathers and shells as their neighbours on the seashore, and I
fancied their complexion to be of a slightly darker shade. Their
only tools for turning up the soil were stone adzes, capable of
penetrating for about four inches. We showed the women a
looking-glass, and they started back and would not look a second
time. I offered my watch to be examined, but no one would touch
the possessed-looking thing.</p>
<p>All the valleys we travelled over were covered with rich
grass, shoulder high, and had we possessed an army of Irish
scythes, and an English market, we might have cut down our
fortune. The hills on the north of the harbour are separated from
a loftier range behind by extensive grass plains, abounding in
water holes, well dotted over with timber, and having a rich
black soil.</p>
<p>Nothing could exceed the kindness of the natives, in proof of
which I will mention but one fact. Mr. Watts, one of our
engineers, lost his way the evening before our visit to this
village, and when beginning to grow anxious, fell in with a party
of natives; far from attempting to take any advantage of his
helplessness, they fed him, and took him to their village, making
signs that they wished him to sleep there. Finding that he wanted
to return to his companions, they offered to guide him,
stipulating, however, that he should show himself off in the
village first, and permit all the inhabitants to admire his white
skin. This he did with a great deal of pleasure, placing himself
on a verandah, to be handled and gazed at by scores of
beholders.</p>
<p>The large village at the entrance to Port Moresby, which
consists of two rows of well-built houses, separated by groves of
cocoa-nut trees, was often visited by us. Its inhabitants,
numbering perhaps 800 of all ages, were well fed,
contented-looking people. The women seemed to busy themselves
much in pottery, and moulded clay into large globe-shaped jars,
which they baked slowly amongst the embers of wood fires. They
use these jars much in their cookery, and I have partaken of a
vegetable porridge cooked in them, consisting of mangrove fruit,
taro, and yams, with cocoa-nut finely shred over all, and found
it excellent. They are skilful in netting bags and fishing-nets,
which they do so precisely in our mode that our men often took up
their shuttles and went on with the net. These nets are made of
the fibre of a small nettle-like plant, and are shaped like our
English seine.</p>
<p>On one occasion an incident happened here which bringing with
them a bundle of rushes, and knotting them together carefully
measured the length and breadth of the ship. They evidently
wished to preserve a record of the size, for they stowed the rush
line away in their canoe with many signs of wonderment.</p>
<p>At most of the villages on this coast we observed that the men
liked to hold our hands as we walked through, and that they did
not wish us to enter their houses; but if we pressed the point
they yielded in this, and awaited us patiently outside. We used
sometimes to sit and rest on the verandah or landing-place
outside the door of the upper storey, and they would bring us
fresh cocoa-nut milk, or some of the sago they had boiled for
their meal. These people, and all the light-coloured Malay race
of eastern New Guinea, are without bows and arrows. As far as
Redscar Bay we saw toy bows amongst the children, but beyond that
point the bow ceases altogether, till it reappears on the
northern shores, west of Astrolobe Gulf. The houses visited by us
all contained spears and stone weapons, some of the latter very
well shaped and finished.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, 26th, Lieutenant Hayter returned, having made
some soundings and diligently examined over fifty miles of coast,
in which neither harbour nor river were to be seen. He confirmed
our good opinion of the natives, saying that he had found them
friendly on all occasions. Walking over the hills that evening,
Dr. Goodman and I were much struck with the surprised us. A
number of natives came on board, beauty of some parrots flying
from tree to tree. The bodies were black, wings green, and heads
and tails scarlet.</p>
<p>Next day was an anxious but successful one. I had set my heart
on finding a passage for the ship by an inshore route between the
mainland and Barrier Reef back to the anchorage in Redscar Bay,
so as to prove that Port Moresby might be reached thus, as well
as through the opposite opening in the Barrier Reef which we had
named Basilisk Passage. With Mr. Bentley by my side, therefore, I
conned the ship from the foretop for twenty miles through the
winding channel which we had previously discovered running
between reefs, and giving us several times but three feet of
water to spare under our keel. It was an anxious time, but we
never touched, and dropped anchor safe and sound in Redscar Bay,
having established the fact of the existence of a passage. What a
miserable spot the bay seemed after lake-like, mountain-girt Port
Moresby!&mdash;so dreary-looking, so exposed too to the full
strength of the S.E. monsoon. And this anchorage, lying four
miles out at sea, was the only one known on the S.E. coast of New
Guinea till the discovery of Port Moresby. Was it any wonder if
we were all inclined to exult a little?</p>
<p>At daylight, on the 28th, Mr. Mudge and I started with the
galley to explore the remaining or northern branch of Redscar
River, and calling at the Towton village, shipped one of the
native teachers as pilot, and made sail over the broad sheet of
Galley Reach in a north-easterly direction to its head. Arrived
there, we could find no principal river. A mangrove swamp lay
before us, subject to frequent inundations, and cut up into
innumerable channels, some of which were broad enough to raise
our hopes. We explored several of these, but invariably the
mangroves and bastard palms closed in on us till we could no
longer move our oars; and farther on, the canoe paddles, to which
we betook ourselves, were stopped by the narrowness of the ditch
and the rank vegetation that overhung it. More than once we lost
our way, though every precaution was taken, and each change noted
on a tracing; and a dread came over me that we might have to pass
a night in this dismal swamp, the home of reptiles and fever. The
thick vegetation caused a gloom that amounted in places to
darkness, and at times we had to stand up in the boat and cut our
way through the tangled creepers. As our paddles struck the muddy
banks, little slimy creatures slid away from us, and myriads of
spider-crabs crawled out, tiny things, with burnished shells,
white, brown, and red, not larger than a shilling, and escaped
with great swiftness. This was the only animal life we saw
here.</p>
<p>After much effort we succeeded in extricating ourselves from
this foul choking labyrinth, and anchored in the head waters of
Galley Reach, where we refreshed ourselves with dinner. Here
myriads of flying-foxes came about us, and I shot one, but it
hung on by the hooks of its wings on a high tree, and when
dislodged by another shot, fell into the water and sank like a
stone. Dinner over, we once more took to our oars, and pulled for
the mouth of a considerable river which we had observed emptying
itself into Galley Reach, about two miles from its head. The heat
was most oppressive, but we pulled up this new river till dark.
We had divided ourselves into two sets, each of which took a
half-hour's spell at the oars in turn. Mr. Mudge, two seamen, and
I, made one party, and the four remaining seamen the other. As
evening closed in we looked out anxiously for a spot on which to
land and boil some water for our tea, but could see none. At
last, on a knot of dryer mud than the rest, we contrived to make
a fire and refresh ourselves with that greatest of all comforts
after such a day's work&mdash;a basin of tea; after which we
prepared ourselves as if for an Arctic night to defy the
mosquitoes&mdash;pulling on two pairs of trousers and two coats
apiece, boots, thick stockings, and gloves; wrapping the head,
neck, and ears in bunting, and smearing our faces with oil; and
this done we hauled off into the stream for the night. Some of us
had three hours of broken sleep, but those who had left any part
of the body unprotected did not even doze. In the morning our
clothes were as wet with perspiration as if they had been dipped
over the side, but anything was better than being covered with
mosquito bites. We began our work with the first streak of day,
and groped along through the dense malarious fog that filled the
channel, till the sun arose and drank it up, when we pulled on
cheerily, looking for a spot to land on and cook breakfast; but
all was dank swamp, covered with rank vegetation, through which
trees shot up to a height of 200 feet, whilst bastard palms
trailed their leaves, thirty and forty feet long, in the muddy
tide of what had now become a rapid fresh-water river.</p>
<p>We landed at last, and tried hard to light a fire, but could
not succeed, though we used carbolic acid, so had to content
ourselves with a cold breakfast.</p>
<p>The swiftness of the current now increased rapidly, and
uprooted trees and logs came shooting with the stream round its
abrupt corners, and made progress dangerous. These trees at last
made such a barrier that we were obliged to yield to
circumstances and turn the boat's head backwards, leaving to
those who shall follow us the honour of reaching the Highlands of
New Guinea by this water-way. The depth at our turning-point,
about ten miles from the mouth of this branch, was close on
twelve feet, the breadth some thirty yards.</p>
<p>It is impossible for me to express an opinion as to how far
the swiftness of these two rivers, named by us the Usborne and
the Edith, may be due to the obstructions which have fallen
across their course, but I think they must considerably influence
it. Explorers coming to the two points where we left off, with
light portable boats, could easily settle this question. Both
rivers could be ascended without difficulty by steam-launches,
and used for rafting down timber and other produce to the sea.
Leaving an ample supply of provisions with the Samoen teachers,
we weighed at sunset for Cape York. Sunday, 2d, was a day of
rest, hailed by many, for those of us who had been most away from
the ship were tormented with boils and prickly heat, the result
of continual exposure, and fatigued with constant rowing, and
effort of all kinds. We anchored for the night off Bramble Cay,
where Mr. Hayter and party were fortunate in capturing a fine
hawk's-bill turtle before morning. It rained and blew hard next
day, but we ran on from island to island, and anchored at Albany
Pass, Somerset, at 8 o'clock <small>P.M</small>., on Wednesday
5th, in a heavy squall of wind and rain, where we found our
store-ship, the "Restless", awaiting us. Monday came with
water-spouts of rain, but we got the "Restless" alongside, and
began to take in our stores.</p>
<p>At Somerset we found eighty-five disappointed diggers
returning from the gold-fields at Port Darwin, in the barque
"Springbok". They were suffering dreadfully from want of
provisions and stores; and the master had proved so incompetent
that a Naval Court, which I appointed to examine into the
charges, removed him from his command. I placed Sub-Lieutenant
Alan Waters in command of the "Springbok", thus entrusting him
with as difficult and responsible a task as could well fall to
the lot of so young an officer; not only had he to keep in
subjection these eighty-five unruly men, rendered doubly
difficult to manage by the privations they were enduring, but
also to navigate a heavy ship against a strong monsoon, through
most intricate navigation, inside the great Barrier Reef. It
speaks well for the professional ability of young officers of the
present day that Mr. "Waters was able to maintain his authority
over these rough diggers, under exceedingly trying circumstances,
and thrashing his ship through all dangers, to bring his
half-famished crew in safety to Newcastle, N.S.W.</p>
<p>On March 7th, Navigating-Lieutenant Connor, and Mr. Pitt,
midshipman, rejoined us from their survey on the northern shore
of Torres Straits. These two officers, and their nine men, had
been detached for six weeks in open boats, exposed to a tropical
sun, and to severe weather on a lee shore, and now returned,
having made a highly valuable trigonometrical survey of Saibai
and Cornwallis Islands, and of a part of the New Guinea Coast. It
is impossible to describe the relief and pleasure it gave us to
welcome our shipmates amongst us again, all safe and in rude
health; burnt nearly as dark as Papuans with exposure, but
willing to start away again if more work should call them.</p>
<p>We handed over the three native teachers and two wives,
brought by us from Redscar Bay, to Mr. Murray, with their health
all but re-established, which was satisfactory, the poor
creatures being very grateful for the kindness shown them on
board. I addressed a report to Mr. Murray on the state in which
we had found the mission stations visited by us, and gave him a
full and true account of the unprovided and actually starving
state of the Polynesian teachers placed on these Torres Straits
Islands by the London Missionary Society, and left alone to fight
a losing battle against famine, sickness, want of knowledge of
the languages required, and the contempt and hostility of fierce
Papuan heathen. The Rev. A. W. Murray, with his wife, had arrived
from Sydney, and taken up his quarters at Cape York, in a
bungalow, kindly placed at their service by Mr. Jardine, and from
this central point he hoped to control and sustain the various
mission parties scattered not only on the islands of Torres
Straits, but even as far as Redscar Bay, on the New Guinea coast,
more than 300 miles from Cape York. He laboured, however, under
the difficulty of having no vessel, nor other means of
communication with these widely separated stations; and reports
of death and disaster attacking these unfortunate native teachers
were arriving up to the time of our leaving Cape York to make
this late cruise. Under these circumstances I had been glad to
make myself useful, and take such supplies for them as Mr. Murray
could provide. I had now to inform him that I had found the real
state of these poor creatures far worse than anticipated. At
Jarvis Island their only store of food, when visited by us,
consisted of ten or twelve pounds of salt meat for four adults
and two infants, but this island being a pearl-shelling station,
they were kept from actual starvation by the humanity of the
pearl-shellers; and were living in a poor and very uncleanly
native hut, wholly without influence of any kind over the natives
of the island. At Cornwallis they were better off, having a roomy
house, and good sweet potato and melon gardens; but of the four
teachers, their wives and children, one child and three adults
were down with fever, and Dr. Goodman, on examining their
medicine, had reported that they possessed no proper medicines,
nor any understanding to guide them in using such medicines as
they had. At Murray Island the two teachers and their wives were
well off, having good native houses, and plenty of yams, but they
complained much of having no trade to purchase other food from
the natives. The circumstances of the teachers at Redscar may
have already been described, but it may be added that but for our
visit, and the abundant supplies we gave them, it seemed most
probable that all would have perished.</p>
<p>At Bampton Island the two native teachers and their wives, who
had been posted there some months previously, and had not since
been visited nor supplied, had been murdered by the natives.</p>
<p>I am glad to know that matters have now been put on a better
footing. The Society has sent out a small steamer, which is to
have her headquarters at Cape York, and by means of this vessel
regular communication will be maintained with the various
stations. Several younger labourers have also taken the place of
the venerable Mr. Murray, who has well earned rest after a
lifetime of faithful labour and much success. It pained me to
make the above reports to this worthy gentleman, but I felt that
he would generously understand that an onus lay on me to see to
the welfare of all natives claiming the protection of the English
flag, whether pearl-shellers or Christian teachers; and in this
belief I was not mistaken.</p>

in this part of the station till relieved by another ship, about
the 1st of June. Two months, therefore, lay at our disposal, to
be employed in cruising in Torres Straits and on the south coast
of New Guinea.</p>
<p>From Lord Normanby I had received a request to co-operate with
Mr. Jardine in selecting another site for the establishment at
Somerset, one better suited to increasing requirements. I also
determined to revisit the principal pearl-shelling stations, and
see-that all was right there; but these two duties would barely
occupy a week. Before our leaving Sydney the question of the
exploration of the unknown south-east coast of New Guinea had
been publicly discussed, attention having been particularly
called to that great island by the sad fate of the "Maria"
expedition.</p>
<p>Notes of alarm were sounded, to the effect that Russian,
French, and Italian travellers were now exploring this island,
the possession of which must in the future be a necessity to
Australia because of its near vicinity and its strategic and
relative geographical position, and it was feared that these
efforts might lead to a foreign occupation in time.</p>
<p>Amongst other rumours it was reported that Americans were
about to send an expedition from San Francisco to examine the
eastern shores of the island. I deeply felt the importance of
forestalling any attempts of alien nations to establish a claim
to this great island, knowing that foreign possession might lead
to complications, and feeling that the development of the great
Australian Empire would be cramped in the future should its
progress be arrested in the north. I desired also to secure for
England the honour due to a country which had sent Cook, and
Dampier, and Owen Stanley to these seas, by filling in the last
great blank remaining in their work, and laying down the unknown
outlines of East New Guinea on the map of the world.</p>
<p>My means to accomplish these desires were very small; I had
but two months' time at my disposal, and was confined by my
orders to the eastern limit of 148 E. longitude, just the
longitude of Port Moresby, a paragraph in which, however, gave me
power to go beyond this degree should circumstances warrant
it.</p>
<p>I had received directions from the commodore to make all
possible inquiries and search for Mr. Macklay, the eminent
Russian traveller, who had been wandering in New Guinea, and this
search, combined with duties to be performed under the kidnapping
Act, might, I hoped, give us opportunity to render good
service.</p>
<p>Before leaving Cape York I again entrusted
Navigating-Lieutenant Connor with the charge of a survey on the
northern shores of Torres Straits. This energetic officer had not
been idle during our stay at Somerset, but instead of enjoying
the rest he had so well earned, had busied himself in making a
trigonometrical survey of the harbour at Somerset, which I had
pleasure in forwarding to the Admiralty.</p>
<p>Mr. Pitt, midshipman, was succeeded by Mr. Grant, midshipman,
as second to Navigating-Lieutenant Connor. Every possible
precaution was taken to secure the comfort and safety of the
small company to be left behind; and our shipmates left us for
two months' work with that light-hearted energy which young
officers and seamen always feel when going away on detached
service.</p>
<p>The gun-room mess was now reduced to the number of two
midshipmen and an assistant-paymaster, Mr. Byron, a zealous young
officer, ready to make himself useful on all occasions. Our
senior lieutenant, boatswain, and gunner, were now our only
executive officers; but no ship ever had better petty-officers
than the "Basilisk", and during the frequent absences of these
remaining officers on surveying work during our coming cruise,
they performed the ordinary duties of lieutenants in a
satisfactory manner.</p>
<p>On March 20th we sailed from Cape York for our anxious cruise,
which seemed to hold out possibilities of useful issues. Our
first object was to examine Hammond Island, which is situated at
the western entrance, by which all ships are advised to enter
Torres Straits, and to leave them when coming from the eastward,
and is thus on the direct track of all passing vessels, besides
being in a position that commands the pearl-shell fisheries.
These advantages seem to mark it out as the proper site for the
English settlement in these waters. The island is about three
miles and a half by one and a half in extent, high and rocky on
the western side, which commands the entrance to Torres Straits,
and sprinkled over with boulders. The hills on the island are
precipitous, and rise to a height of 600 feet. Mr. Mudge and Mr.
Bentley went on shore with two parties to explore in different
directions. I took a third party; and Mr. Mourilyan went to take
soundings off shore. One object was to find water, and this we
all succeeded in doing. My party fortunately landed at a bay into
which a stream of fresh water, almost large enough to be called a
river, was discharged, and this was the more welcome as the
Torres Straits Islands are almost wholly destitute of water. We
followed the stream up through a deep rocky gorge, amongst scenes
as picturesque as can be imagined. Sometimes it was lost to sight
in a gloomy depth, overhung by tropic growth, then it rose again,
racing and foaming over huge boulders, forming here waterfalls
ten or fifteen feet deep, and there deep stilly pools, from which
it slipped softly down. On reaching the summit we found that the
hills spread themselves out into a large concave plain, forming a
great natural reservoir, from which many streams descended, a
very cheering discovery. The island is well wooded, and also
possesses extensive clear grass plots, but except on the heights
the soil is poor. Mr. Mourilyan's soundings soon showed that safe
and commodious anchorage can be obtained here in perfectly smooth
water, and out of the strong currents which sweep through Prince
of Wales's Channel, on either the north-east or north-west of the
island, according as the north-west or south-east monsoons
prevail. The shore-reefs here also afford facilities for running
out piers, whilst the loftiness of the island would doubtless
render it a healthy station. Having thus enabled ourselves to
report favourably of Hammond Island, we proceeded to take up the
second part of our work, and revisited the principal
pearl-shelling establishments on the various islands, which we
found still idle and awaiting government licenses.</p>
<p>We visited Cornwallis, and sailed for Warrior Island on the
26th, when we had a narrow escape, for, set out of our way by a
strong flood-tide, we ran right over an unknown shoal, and for
some time had only three fathoms of water&mdash;nine inches above
our draft&mdash;under the keel. Every moment we expected to hear
the horrible grating noise, and feel the life-like motion of the
ship reduced to stillness. We anchored, and when the tide
slackened got clear without having touched a grain of sand. The
anxieties of years seemed to have crowded into that short
time&mdash;all our hopes of good service; the very safety of the
ship, were jeopardised.</p>
<p>Leaving Torres Straits on the 28th of March, we sailed on our
way to the east coast of New Guinea, glad indeed to be clear of
the intricacies of Torres Straits, with a new and unentered field
of work stretching away before us. At Bramble Cay we tried for
turtle as before, with no success; but the men brought off
buckets full of sea-bird's eggs, which were sweet and
well-tasted. Many of the stupid birds allowed themselves to be
knocked down with sticks, and the men appeared to enjoy eating
them, in spite of a rank fishy taste.</p>
<p>Our first point was Yule Island, off which we had seen the
large quantity of driftwood, that had led me to hope we should
find some great river issuing from the New Guinea mainland
here.</p>
<p>On Sunday, at 7 <small>P.M</small>., we anchored off Yule
Island, and spent a quiet day; lying just opposite to what seemed
the mouth of a large river, but we had learned by this time not
to trust to appearances, and did not hope too much. Yule Island
had been laid down on the chart by the "Rattlesnake", when she
passed along the coast in 1849, but no white man had ever
penetrated to the noble-looking sheet of water which lay inside
between it and the mainland. We began on Monday 1st to sound for
an entrance into it, attempting this simultaneously by the north
and south channels, Mr. Mourilyan and I working at the north,
which we believed to be the most hopeful, as the Stanley survey
marked it as "probably a clear passage", whilst Mr. Pitt sounded
out the south. The result of our work was exactly contrary to our
expectations, for we found the north entrance blocked by reefs,
and the north side of the harbour a great mud flat; whilst the
south entrance, supposed to be blocked by reefs, proved to be a
good safe channel. The former surveyors had doubtless been
deceived by the discoloured state of the water, caused by the
amount of fresh water escaping here. Through this channel we now
took the "Basilisk" in, and she soon lay at anchor in the broad
waters of <i>Robert Hall Sound</i>, as we decided to name this,
our second found harbour on the south New Guinea coast, after the
secretary of the Admiralty. Robert Hall Sound lies in lat. 9&deg; N.,
and long. 146&deg; 3' E., and is well marked by Yule Island at
its entrance. It is perfectly protected and land-locked, and has
deep water, where hundreds of ships may lie in safety. The land
surrounding it, excepting for some comparatively bold headlands,
is low and swampy ground, backed up six or eight miles inland by
low hills, behind which range rises after range, till the
magnificent Owen Stanley range is reached as a culminating
point.</p>
<p>Yule Island, near which ships would anchor, is high and
healthy ground. At the head of the harbour two rivers issue,
combined, forming the river mouth which had raised our
expectations on Sunday. Of these, Hilda River, a rapid powerful
stream, with too swift a current to be ascended by row boats, but
navigable for steam launches, falls into Ethel River, a mile and
a half from its embouchement, and is doubtless destined in time
to bear the rich produce of the interior downwards on its rapid
bosom. Ethel River upwards, from the point of junction, assumes
the character of a sluggish stream, from 80 to 100 yards in
width, and twelve feet deep, and leads eastward through an
immense mangrove swamp. We ascended it for about ten miles, when,
much to our disappointment, it divided itself into a number of
small channels without a current, some of which were examined by
us, but proved not to lead to the hills. The scenery on the river
banks was monotonous in the extreme&mdash;a dense growth of
mangrove and other moisture-loving trees prevailing, with no
animal life to enliven it, for, with the exception of flying
foxes and some screaming gaudy-coloured birds, nothing living was
to be seen or heard.</p>
<p>Occasionally ill-made native huts were to be seen on the
banks, from which a track through the swamp led to some acres of
raised ground, like an oases in a desert. These were carefully
cleared and cultivated. Here also were some permanent houses,
built as usual on poles some eight feet from the ground, with one
room common to the whole family. The natives hid themselves in
the swamp when we came into sight; indeed it must have appeared
to them as if we had dropped from the clouds. It seemed
marvellous that human life could exist in such a malarious vile
place. Even in the glare of a noonday sun the air was thick with
mosquitoes.</p>
<p>I longed for a steam pinnace to ascend Hilda River, for it
maintained its depth, and evidently ran up into the heart of the
country, and it was bitterly disappointing to have to leave the
fact unverified. Our men pulled their hardest, but the current
was too powerful, and the banks were a mass of intertwined
jungle. I started, after our return to the ship, with an armed
party, to try and find out the villages on Yule Island, and on
landing we met with some natives, who seemed very adverse to our
going to their village. After a while I made them signs that we
wanted rest, and they took us by a long winding path through the
bush, to a large cleared space where their village stood, each
house being the usual large oval-shaped room raised on poles. At
a little distance in the rear were large vegetable and fruit
plantations, neatly fenced in, and well kept. Taking us to a
large house, some forty feet in length, and entirely unoccupied,
they made signs that we might rest in it, which we did, whilst
refreshing ourselves with cocoa-nut milk. The villagers continued
very timid, and all their young women and children were kept out
of sight in the bush, where we could hear them chattering and
laughing. Any movement of ours in their direction met with
energetic remonstrance from the men. However, the older women
were about amongst us, so I was satisfied that we should not be
attacked. The houses, except the one devoted to our use, were all
shut up, and the entrance-doors barred.</p>
<p>Our attempts to trade met with small success, for, having no
conception of the use of iron, they would not barter their
handsome stone implements for our axes. The more we endeavoured
to show their superior value by cutting and chopping branches,
the more incredulously they smiled, and preferred their own rude
instruments.</p>
<p>Before long their curiosity at our white skins, clothes, and
watches, etc., having become exhausted, they made signs that they
wished us to go. Before going I thought to try the effect of
firearms on their minds, so, placing a mark against a tree, and
preparing the natives to expect something wonderful, I had a shot
fired. The first effect was blank amazement, and the second, when
they saw the hole made by the ball, an increased anxiety to be
rid of us. They would not touch our rifles, but pushed them away
with terror. Returning to the ship we met natives in their canoes
diving for cray-fish on the coral reef in one and two fathom
water. Standing in their canoes, they waited till they saw the
big unsuspicious cray-fish crawl leisurely over the coral
beneath, and then flashed overboard, and rarely missed their
prey.</p>
<p>A quantity of fine steel sand was found in Robert Hall
Sound.</p>
<p>The people here are of the Malay type, but differ from the
pure Malay in being less in stature, coarser in feature, thicker
lipped, and having less hair on the face&mdash;being, indeed,
almost beardless. They have high cheek-bones, like the pure
Malay, but their noses are inclined to be aquiline, and are
sometimes well formed; their eyes are dark and beautiful, with
good eyebrows. The men have their hair frizzed out in a mop, but
the women cut theirs short, and tatoo their bodies in graceful
lace-like patterns, which the men never do. They, however, are
not without adornment, for they paint with black, red, and white
pigments; and wear flowers, and the plumes of the Bird of
Paradise, fastened to their heads and shoulders, and occasionally
two great beaks of the hornbill, as horns on the head. They were
much disfigured by constant use of the betel-nut. Unlike the Port
Moresby natives, they are possessed of bows and arrows, of
spears, and clubs of wood and stone, and they seemed to us to be
less kindly disposed than the Port Moresby people. They are
equally ignorant of the use of iron, and no sign of cannibalism
was visible at either place. This race abuts on the black Papuan,
somewhere in the vicinity of Cape Possession; but I do not
believe that a fixed line of demarcation exists, for here both
types of race were present, and the natives varied in colour,
stature, and cast of feature. A mixture of habits also obtained
here, which confirmed the idea of a fusion of races, for some
chewed the betel-nut Malay-wise, whilst others rejected it; some
wore the specially Papuan adornment of the great bill of the
hornbeak on the head, and all were entirely destitute of the
ornaments of human bone that we afterwards found to be generally
worn to the eastward. It must, however, be taken into account
that natives from different parts of the coast, perhaps attracted
by the news of our presence, kept arriving during our stay, as
this would perhaps account in part for the different habits and
shades of colour we observed.</p>
<p>On the morning of April 6th we weighed at eight o'clock, and
stood for East New Guinea, having anxious work before us, and
very few hands to do it with just then,&mdash;Mr. Hayter being
laid up with a throat affection, and Mr. Shortland ill; so that
Mr. Mourilyan, Mr. Pitt, and the two warrant officers, were the
only ones left at this time to do duty. Our work lay where no
navigator had ever laid down a line for us to follow.</p>
<p>Bougainville, D'Entrecasteaux, D'Urville, and Captain Owen
Stanley, had all seen what they took to be the eastern extremity
of New Guinea, but did not approach near enough to define the
outline of the land seen by them. H.M.S. "Blanche" had the
previous year approached the eastern shores of New Guinea from
E.N.E., but, meeting dangerous shoals, had anchored thirty-four
miles from the nearest point of the mainland (East Cape), at
which distance it is not visible, and twenty-one miles E.N.E. of
Moresby Island, the easternmost of the large islands off the
south-east extremity of New Guinea, which was thought by the
"Blanche" to be the mainland (see Admiralty Chart, Papua, sheet
7, A.D. 1875, and hydrographic notices, Pacific Ocean, A.D. 1873,
page 105, paragraphs 2 and 3). The "Blanche" remained in this
position one night, and the following day retraced her way
without having made any nearer approach, leaving the
configuration of the eastern shores of New Guinea still unknown;
but arriving at the same intelligent conclusion as D'Urville,
that the south-east extremity of New Guinea was formed of a
number of high islands.</p>
<p>The state of knowledge previous to the visit of the "Basilisk"
as to the supposed shape of South-East New Guinea will be evident
on referring to the map attached to this book.</p>
<p>Captain Owen Stanley, deceived, doubtless, by the
configuration of the land, laid down the great range of mountains
which bears his name for thirty miles farther to the eastward
than it actually extends, and marked a point of land,
indistinctly seen by him, as the south-eastern extremity of
Papua&mdash;a point afterwards found by us to be no part of the
mainland, but existing as a small island some thirty miles from
the mainland of New Guinea.</p>
<p>Of the north-east shores of New Guinea from East Cape, as
since laid down by us, and shown by the accompanying map, no
knowledge existed, nor is there any record of their ever having
been seen by a white man, till a point is reached, 190 miles as
the crow flies, to the west. There land was indistinctly seen
from a distance by D'Entrecasteaux, and named by him Cape Sud
Est, by a mistake, as this position falls in reality twelve miles
inland on the mountain range which rises there, and was doubtless
believed by D'Entrecasteaux to be the coast-line. Beyond this a
blank succeeded, which was unbroken for forty miles, till another
high point of land, seen indistinctly by D'Entrecasteaux, and
named by him Richie Island, was marked on the chart&mdash;a
misnomer, for no island exists there, and he had in reality
caught a glimpse of the mainland. This was followed by another
blank of some sixty miles to the west, when Huon Gulf was marked
down, after which the mainland had been traced with tolerable
accuracy. The D'Entrecasteaux Islands, so named by their
discoverer, who had never visited them, lying off the north-east
extreme of New Guinea, were so unknown, that the sailing
directions supplied to us said that they would probably be found
to be not islands but an integral part of New Guinea.</p>
<p>The principal cause which appears to have prevented navigators
from nearing these unknown shores, has been the enormous coral
barrier of the Louisiade Reef, which extends from Teste Island to
the east for 200 miles, and is beaten on by an everlasting surf,
blown on by the S.E. monsoon for eight months of the year, and
set on by strong currents which make approach dangerous. These
dangers, and the supposed ferocity of the natives, have caused
the mariner to give this locality a wide berth, and prevented all
attempts to explore the eastern end of New Guinea. Bougainville,
even in his distressed condition, preferred to beat to windward
round the entire Louisiade group, rather than seek for passage
here, on his way to the Dutch settlements; but my conviction was
strong that a passage might be found, through the Louisiade Reef,
which would open up a navigation between Australia and North-East
New Guinea, and shorten the route between Australia and
China.</p>
<p>On April 9th we finally passed out of surveyed waters, and
steered for Teste Island, there to anchor for the night.</p>
<p>Immediately to the west of Teste Island the great Louisiade
Reef sinks from the surface to a depth of ten or twelve fathoms,
and remains submerged for more than 100 miles to the west. Over
this, aptly named by Captain Stanley "The sunken Barrier Reef of
New Guinea". I intended to pass at a point near Teste Island, and
take up the survey from the Heath Point of Captain Stanley's
survey. Teste Island, twenty-two miles south of the then supposed
south-eastern extremity of New Guinea, had been seen from a
distance of six miles by surveying ships, and put on the chart by
Captain Stanley, but not visited. It is a narrow island, about
two miles and a half long, and is traversed by a line of hills
which rises into a peak at each end, and dips in the
centre&mdash;the western peak being about 500, and the eastern
470, feet above the sea. The sides of the hills are wooded, and
the tops bare and grassy. On the ridge, near the western summit,
standing alone, are two remarkable trees of great size and
beauty. I am unable to name their species, but we were several
times struck with the prominence of similar trees towering on
lofty positions.</p>
<p>In Teste Island, and Bell Rock a noble mass of rock about two
miles west of it, which is not more than 100 yards in
circumference, and rises steep from the sea to a height of 420
feet, wooded wherever a crevice offers room for a tree to
grow&mdash;nature has placed striking landmarks. Passing close to
this splendid rock we saw many of the natives, whose canoes were
rocking on the calm waters at its base, perched like monkeys far
up on its rocky ledges, waving green branches, and making all
possible signs of friendship. We returned these signs, and
steered for Teste Island, from which we must have been early
seen, for numerous canoes and catamarans came to us miles from
the island, whose rowers did not manifest any fear of us,
although an accident happened to one poor fellow which might have
caused suspicion. He had seized a fishing-line which our
indefatigable fisherman, Dr. Goodman, was using, to save himself
the trouble of paddling, by being towed; the hook caught him, and
his hands were a good deal torn. Steering for a grove of
cocoa-nut trees on the north side of Teste Island we found a
precarious anchorage within a cable's length of the shore.</p>
<p>The natives here were similar in appearance to those at
Redscar and Port Moresby. They were shy of coming on board at
first, but we tempted one by stripes of red cloth, and I went
down into a catamaran to assure his friends, after which they
crowded on board&mdash;copper-coloured intelligent-looking
people, who number about 300 souls. We made up a party to visit
their village, and they received us in a friendly manner, taking
us by the hands as we stepped on shore, and so leading us the
distance of two miles to their villages on the opposite side of
the island.</p>
<p>Teste Island is rich in soil, and well cultivated in parts,
and its backbone, of high grassy hills, slopes away at either
side into fine cocoa-nut groves, and fenced-in plantations of
fruits and vegetables, sufficient to feed three times the number
of inhabitants. The houses, which are large, and are kept clean
and neat, are simply wooden frames thatched over. I cannot better
describe their appearance than by asking you to think of a large
clothes-basket as inverted and placed upon poles six feet high,
the basket to be forty feet long by twelve wide, with a floor
laid four feet below its rim, neatly covered with mats. We found
distinct traces of devil-worship here&mdash;a thing unknown in
our after experience of New Guinea. The people possessed small
ugly figures, carved on sticks and bowls, of hard wood, which by
signs they made us understand had great power. These things were
all in the keeping of the women, with whom we found it impossible
to trade, whilst the men were ready to give us all they possessed
for our red cloth and knives; that is, with one exception, for it
was hard to induce them to part with their ornaments made from
the bones of slain enemies. These consisted of bracelets of human
jaw-bones and spiral rings, and as we examined these they made us
understand, in a boastful way, that they had eaten their first
owners.</p>
<p>The skulls of these unfortunates were also hung up in numbers
in the villages. We made a collection of wooden swords and clubs,
and then returned to the ship by a course which took us nearly
all round the island, and kept us scrambling over volcanic rocks
all the way, so that we were heartily ready for a plunge into the
cool water when we reached the coral beach where our boats lay at
anchor.</p>
<p>From our anchorage at Teste Island, the blue outline of the
supposed New Guinea coast showed to the north at twenty miles'
distance. Anxiously I scanned it for some indication of its
character, and drew comfort from its lofty appearance, for it was
a bold honest outline, not a mass of swamp and reef.</p>
<p>Hoping for the best, we left Teste Island, and steered for
what was marked on the chart as the "south-east extremity of
Papua, indistinctly seen", and distant from Teste Island about
twenty-two miles, laying down a line of soundings as we went, and
having occasional false alarms of shoal water, which proved only
to be tide-rips. As we neared our destination, we found to our
surprise that the so-called "south-east extremity" was nothing
but a point on an island, which evidently made one of a group of
small lofty islands lying about a mile off what we were now led
to suppose was the true east extremity of Papua.</p>
<p>The weather now came on thick and squally, so we sought for an
anchorage in a large bay some twelve miles to the westward of the
island, which fortunately answered our expectations, and took up
a sheltered berth under what we now believed to be the mainland
of New Guinea. The southward land of the bay having somewhat the
appearance of an island, our boats were sent to explore, and
found it was such, the officer reporting it to be a small island
about two miles in length, separated from the mainland by a
channel only a quarter of a mile broad.</p>
<p>Our anchor was scarcely let go before, from the villages on
the sandy shore of the bay, and from the newly-found islets,
canoes of all sizes issued and hovered about us at a distance. We
turned all our attention to gain the good-will of our visitors,
knowing how much our future success depended on it, but for more
than an hour all our peaceable signs and baits of bright-coloured
cloths were unavailing. The men, in some sixteen or twenty large
canoes, armed with spears and stone tomahawks, sometimes made a
few strokes with their paddles as if they would venture
alongside, but their hearts always failed them, and they stopped
and anxiously scanned our every movement, ready for instant
flight. At last, when we despaired of success, four men in one of
the small canoes were induced to come near enough to receive our
presents on the extreme ends of the paddles. They came still
closer, and at last one bold islander, enticed by many presents,
and encouraged by much patting on the back, with, "Come along,
old fellow!" slowly climbed the ladder, and stood on our
quarter-deck, looking scared, and squeezing his nose
spasmodically with one forefinger and thumb, and his navel with
the other. Guessing it might mean some form of salutation, we all
responded in the same fashion. The sight was most ludicrous, but
the effect was instantaneous; the scared look gave place to one
of delight as he looked round, and his confidence was complete.
Rejoicing in our discovery, we all stood on the gangways, and so
displayed our knowledge that we made friends of the whole crowd.
The only difficulty after this was to keep our new friends out of
the ship. It was dark before they left us that evening to quiet
and consideration of the friendly intercourse of the day, so
unexpected by us after the reports we had heard of the ferocity
of these people. Their surprise was always great on first coming
on board at the size of the deck, and at all they saw,
particularly at the brass rails and glass hatchway coverings, and
they expressed it by a peculiar inarticulate sound. Our first
visitors at a new place would come up the ladder by degrees, and
peeping through the gangway, return to their canoes, telling the
others what they had seen; then others would steal up, till at
last one more bold than the rest would venture on deck. One of us
would take him by the hand and lead him forward to look at the
wonders of the ship, and he would then return to his companions,
bring them up and (evidently proud of his position) lead them
forward, and show them what he himself had seen. It was with
great difficulty we could get them to approach the sheep we had
on board&mdash;they appeared to think them ferocious. It appeared
to afford them great amusement to watch us at meals; and they
would sit in a circle round the wardroom skylight, pointing at
us, and occasionally roaring with laughter, and afterwards they
might be seen relating the details of the meal to their
companions, and imitating our use of the knife and fork. They
were willing to take anything that came from the ship in the way
of barter; cocked-hats manufactured out of newspapers had a great
run for a short time; pictures they seemed slow to comprehend,
but would take them. Hoop-iron, however, was always in the
greatest demand from the time we first offered it, and thus this
anchorage came to be named "Hoop-iron Bay". The price of a pig
varied here from one to three trade hatchets; and, as a proof of
the honesty of the vendors, it should be told that a pig which
had been bought in the daytime and had jumped overboard at night
and was drowned, was brought to us by a canoe in the morning.
From henceforth in New Guinea iron-hoop became the standard of
value; for these natives, unlike those at Robert Hall Sound and
Redscar Bay, were alive to the value of iron&mdash;some few
carefully preserved specimens of which, in the shape of sharpened
bolts and spike-nails, we found scattered in most of their
villages. These relics were probably obtained from the eastern
islands of the Louisiade Group, where ships are known to have
been wrecked, and with whose inhabitants intercourse is probably
held by means of the large trading canoes hailing from New
Guinea, which were frequently met by us at sea.</p>
<p>The iron hoop and scrap iron had the most value in their eyes,
for it was readily shaped into the form of their stone hatchets
and fitted into the handles, so all Her Majesty's iron hoop on
board was served out in equal proportions to the various messes,
and our men were enabled to purchase an abundant supply of yams,
fruits, and pigs. The natives here are a small, active,
copper-coloured race, with frizzled hair standing out a foot from
their heads, and similar in appearance to those at Port Moresby.
They paint and adorn themselves in a hideous manner, principally
with black and white pigments, shells, strips of bark, and palm
leaves. Cassowary and Birds of Paradise head-dresses were
commonly worn; and they, as well as the Teste Islanders, wear the
bones of their devoured enemies as bracelets. Some of the men had
the entire body blackened with a mixture of charcoal and
cocoa-nut oil; and they made us understand that this was done as
mourning for the death of a relation. They appeared to treat
their women kindly, and permitted them to have their say in
bartering, and to meet us freely. The good feeling shown towards
us by these poor savages was an unspeakable comfort to me, for
every reason; not the least being, that any hostility on their
part would have hindered or even stopped our work.</p>

<p><small>EARLY</small> on Good Friday morning, Mr. Mourilyan and
I started to climb to the top of the island under which we were
anchored to a height of 600 feet, for the purpose of taking
angles. From the ship, O'Neill Island as we named it, appeared a
precipitous ascent, crowned at the summit of the highest peak by
one large and graceful tree, which forms a good landmark here,
and covered with what seemed a soft velvety emerald grass. How
deceitful was this latter appearance! This velvety sward proved
to be coarse, sharp-edged, thickly interwoven grass, from ten to
fourteen feet high. Our party&mdash;Mr. Mourilyan, the coxswain,
two of the boat's crew, and I landed at a spot clear of the
village, so as to avoid delay from the natives, pushed our way
through a belt of scrub, and found ourselves amongst this grass.
We faced the perpetually rising grass wall boldly, thinking, at
first, that every step would show us daylight beyond, but it was
no short work that lay before us. Our plan was for the leading
man of the party to throw himself bodily forward, and press the
grass down with his dead-weight, pick himself up, and repeat the
operation; and we relieved each other at this post at very short
intervals. We were soon all bleeding from the sharpness of the
grass; the want of circulation of air between our grassy walls,
and the fierceness of the sun also, tried us sorely. The
coxswain, a fine powerful man, became exhausted, and we left him
behind in charge of one of the men, and struggled on, till after
about two hours of effort we stood under the noble tree, with
clothes cut into rags, and skin not much better, but still there,
which was worth it all. After a little rest we climbed the
stately trunk, and were able to look down on our grassy enemy
from its branches. The glorious prospect before us took all our
thoughts; but what was this? There lay the south-east end of New
Guinea with its great mountain chain, cleft suddenly in twain by
a bright blue thread that lay across it! We thought our eyes must
be playing us false&mdash;that it could not be water, but was
perhaps a blue mist lying in a deep valley, or a river. It was
only visible in parts between the hills; but the valley through
which it passed afforded an opening by which the sea was visible
on the other side, running up in a bay to the end of this blue
strait, if strait it was; and this made us exclaim "We have not
yet found the true south-east extreme of New Guinea." Having
taken a round of angles, we descended easily by our beaten track,
found Jenkins all right, and went on board to discuss our
hot-cross buns. Then came Divine service as befitted the day; and
after the men had dined, Mr. Mourilyan and I left the ship to
make sure of the new discovery. There it was, plain to be seen, a
noble strait, contracting in one part to a width of about a
quarter of a mile, and expanding to that of three or four miles
of deep navigable water, unmarked by reefs, sprinkled with
islets, leading through from sea to sea. It was flanked on both
sides by mountains covered with forest, that rose steep from the
water's edge to a height of 1400 or 1500 feet, and were broken
into picturesque valleys and gorges. A fierce tide ran through
Fortescue Straits, as we named them, causing an overfall
dangerous for boats in the narrow parts. These straits cut off
nearly fourteen miles from New Guinea, and gave us Moresby
Island. Our south-east cape of the day before was now proved to
be a point not on the mainland but on Moresby Island. On Saturday
12th we began a running survey of our discoveries. My first
object was to examine Fortescue Straits, with the hope that they
would prove a navigable channel by which we could pass to the
north side of New Guinea; and if found such, it occurred to me
that I might be able to point out a new and shorter route between
Australia and China, as well as open up the northern shores of
New Guinea to trade. It was therefore with an exhilarated feeling
that I satisfied myself that the "Basilisk" could be taken
through Fortescue Straits.</p>
<p>Easter Sunday brought us some welcome rest, but not silence,
for all day long the ship was surrounded by canoes filled with
men, women, and children, who kept up a Babel of sound. On Easter
Monday we made an early start, and left Hoop-iron Bay, to the
great regret of our new friends, amongst whose villages our
officers and men had gone freely. Taking the ship through the
narrow waters lying between O'Neill and Moresby Islands, we
turned sharp to the northward, and entered Fortescue Straits,
through which the tide was rushing fast.</p>
<p>The broad waters of the great bay into which the straits
opened, showed plain before us, studded over with islets that
seemed asleep in a great calm. The variety of the tints seen in
northern climes alone, was wanting to make the colouring of this
landscape as perfect as its form. We could scarcely believe that
such beauties had been hidden from European eyes till now. The
"Basilisk" had to do her best to stem the tide, for we had chosen
the time when it should be against us, to avoid the greater
danger of being suddenly carried into unknown reefs. On clearing
the straits, I congratulated myself on gaining the open sea
safely, and had left the deck for a few minutes when the sound of
"Three fathoms!" called from the chains, brought me quickly on
deck, to find that we had passed into a labyrinth of reefs. On
one of them we struck, but fortunately passed over. Reefs and
broken water now appeared in all directions round; but we found
our way to a snug anchorage off a good-sized inhabited island,
named by us "Carrie Island", at the northern extreme of Fortescue
Straits; and, as soon as the ship swung to her anchor, sent all
our boats away to search for a channel through the reefs. Our
disappointment at meeting these reefs was keen, as their presence
threatened to make the Straits almost valueless from a practical
point of view, and the more we laboured the more reefs we found;
and of a particularly dangerous kind&mdash;small detached masses,
from twenty to a hundred yards in circumference, with deep water
channels between, scattered about everywhere, like flowers in a
flower-bed. I was not without hopes of picking out a safe channel
for the few miles needful, and of finding it lead speedily into a
clear sea. I was possessed with a sense of the importance of
finding a passage round the east end of New Guinea, and believing
then in the general report of a vast extent of reefs barring the
sea to the east of the land just found by us to be an island, I
based all my hopes of finding a passage on this strait. All,
however, was in vain. The most diligent search only proved that
no safe outlet existed through the reefs that blocked the
northern entrance of Fortescue Straits.</p>
<p>Almost despairing of taking the ship through to the northern
shores of New Guinea in the limited time at my disposal, I
resolved to make such surveys as were possible in the boats,
which unfortunately were of the most useless description supplied
to H.M. ships. A slow, heavy, eight-oared cutter, and my galley,
which was a fast boat, but so lean at her ends as to be very
dangerous in a sea-way.</p>
<p>Leaving the ship anchored at Carrie Island on April 15th, Mr.
Mourilyan, Mr. Pitt, and I, made an early start in the galley and
cutter, to survey the north and east shores of Moresby Island. We
completed a running survey of the northern shores, which extend
about twelve miles east and west, before evening, and found it
strewn with villages built in the usual Malay fashion, and
surrounded by plantations of sago-palm, cocoa-nut, and other
fruit trees. The abrupt hills, of which the highest peak, 1326
feet high, was named by us, "Fairfax", were covered with forest
trees, except on the extensive Cultivated patches which ran up
their sides. Towards the north-east end of the island several
deep bays were passed which we had not time to examine; till,
reaching the eastern extremity, I ascended a considerable hill,
which I named "Cape Look-out", and anxiously scanned the sea to
the east. Well it seemed to justify its supposed dangers, for
reefs and broken water abounded. The view was very fine, and it
was a stirring thing to be the first to gaze on the new groups of
low wooded coral, and lofty volcanic islands, which thickly
studded the eastern sea; and turning north to see the dark purple
D'Entrecasteaux Islands, twenty miles away, separate their lofty
heights from the mass of New Guinea, of which they had hitherto
been often supposed an integral part. To the north-west ran a
large extent of lofty land, which I supposed then to be a great
unknown island, and resolved if possible to visit. I came down
deeply impressed with the vast amount of work waiting to be done,
and regretting the smallness of our time and means. As night
closed in we ran into a capacious bay, which I named after the
midshipman in charge of the cutter, "Pitt Bay"; and landing on
the white coral beach of a luxuriant little island, we lighted
our fires, and cooked, and ate, and talked of the events of the
day, over our evening glass of grog, till the stars shone out. We
were weary enough to keep early hours, and soon covering in the
boats with their awnings, and paddling out into the bay beyond
mosquito range, we resigned ourselves to rest. The softly lapping
water was very lulling, but it was not easy to sleep at once. The
half-pleasing feeling of loneliness, which the quiet and
isolation of the spot was sure to produce, the sense of distance
from home and friends, speculations as to what unknown thing the
next day would give to our knowledge, and as to the effect our
discoveries might have on the course of trade, and the future of
New Guinea, refused to be dismissed. One beautiful object was of
itself enough to make one wakeful&mdash;the reef over which we
lay; it shone with such a clear pale effulgence, from the
phosphoric creatures that floated over it.</p>
<p>The following morning all hands were turned up as usual, and
paddling to shore we lit our fires and cooked breakfast. Then
arms were cleaned and inspected, morning prayers read, and we
were ready to work. During the night I had noticed that a
considerable body of the tide escaped through a narrow opening
into what seemed to be a part of Moresby Island, so we first
explored this creek, which was scarcely wide enough to admit the
passage of the boats, even when using native paddles instead of
oars, and found that it cut off a considerable piece of land from
Moresby Island, and led us out on the south-eastern shores. Here
a multitude of islands, dotted with picturesque villages, of
channels, creeks, and wooded bays, formed a fairy archipelago,
which it was not easy to place on paper. It was a living picture,
too, for many natives were fishing on the reefs, and paddling
about in their graceful canoes. We spent as much time as we could
here; but it was important that we should explore the strange
land seen from Cape Look-out to the north-west, so having joined
the outline of Moresby Island to the point where we had fixed it
in the ship, we turned our faces towards the "Basilisk"; landing
on the way, that these eastern natives might know something of
us, at a large village, at the head of a fine deep bay. We were
few in number, and its inhabitants might easily have attacked us
had they been so disposed; but they received us with the greatest
cordiality; making the usual absurd sign of welcome, and our men
strolled about, feeling quite at home, taking care of course not
to separate from each other, and to be pleasant with the natives.
Mr. Mourilyan and I were taken by the villagers to a fine
mountain stream, with deep pools, that contained fine fresh water
fish, some of which were a pound in weight. They also let us have
a large supply of yams, cocoa-nuts, and a pig for our trade. A
strong favourable breeze brought us back to the ship at Carrie
Island in the evening, where I found that all was well, and that
so extensive a trade had been opened up with the natives that
several tons of yams had been bought for hoop-iron&mdash;a grand
supply of farinaceous food. During our absence the ship had been
visited by some trading canoes of large size which came from the
east&mdash;we supposed from some of the Louisiade group. The
natives appeared to fear these new-comers, and hid away till they
were gone, making signs to us on their return, that they were bad
men.</p>
<p>The two following days were devoted to attempts to find a safe
passage by which the ship might pass to the north end of
Fortescue Straits, but the discovery of reefs after reefs, with
no anchorage near them, compelled me at last to give up this
hope, and to fall back on our boats for the proposed expedition
to the land seen to the north-west. This was rather a serious
undertaking, but officers and men were willing workers; the
weather appeared settled, and I resolved to attempt it. My chief
anxiety was with respect to the conduct of the natives we might
meet; they were, however, certain to be unacquainted with
firearms, and the mere report of a gun would probably be
sufficient to ensure our safety. Having provisioned and stored
our boats for a week's cruise, a supply which was as much as we
could conveniently carry, we made an early start on April 19th
leaving the ship still at anchor off Carrie Island; Mr. Mourilyan
being with me in the galley, and Mr. Mudge, boatswain, in charge
of the cutter, and made sail to the north-west, for the lofty
unknown land seen in that direction. Towards noon it fell a dead
calm, with no signs of a coming breeze, and by this time we had
opened an extensive bay about ten miles west of Fortescue
Straits, which, it was evident from its depth, must nearly unite
with the sea on the south side of New Guinea. I should have
passed on had there been any wind, but the importance of giving
the men a good night's rest decided me to pull in south and
examine this bay, which seemed to extend about twelve miles from
east to west, by five or six miles in breadth, and was studded
over with wooded islets. Nearing its southern shores we looked
sharply for an opening in the neck of land, a southern entrance
to the bay, and every moment our impression strengthened that we
were cutting off another island from the supposed length of New
Guinea; there certainly could not be half-a-mile of land lying
between us and the Southern Sea now, as we stood towards a sharp
range of wooded hills. These hills were five or six hundred feet
high, covered with thick forest, and sank in one or two places to
the height of about 150 feet; I resolved to try and reach the
summit of the highest of them. Presently two overlapping points
seemed to separate, and through an opening, at first not bigger
than a window, we saw the distant horizon. Expressions of wonder
passed freely round there lay a narrow strait before us, uniting
the waters of the bay to the broad blue Southern Sea, and cutting
off ten or twelve miles more from the supposed length of New
Guinea. It looked as though a giant had bitten a morsel out of
the narrow ridge of mountains that ran along the neck of land,
and let the sea sweep through. Being anxious to explore this
discovery before dark, which was just approaching, the men gave
way with a will, forgetting their fatigue, and we entered these
fairy-like straits, about a hundred yards wide, to which dark
steep hills came down on each side. Numerous canoes were fishing
in quiet coves off the straits. The crews of which paddled wildly
for shore, and disappeared in the bush at our approach. We had no
time to land and conciliate them, but pushed on through this
remarkably beautiful opening into the great Southern Sea.</p>
<p>We had separated another island from New Guinea, and found
ourselves now in an open bay, near a large village, on the shores
of the newly discovered island, the inhabitants of which were
watching us with intense interest. We were anxious to find if
this narrow opening would afford a passage for the ship, and
spent the remainder of daylight in examining it; but a rocky
ledge, which ran across, barred it to ships, and made it
dangerous even for boats at the strength of the tide, the
overfall of pent-up water was so great. The island, now added to
the map, formed three sides of a hollow square open to the west,
its length being about nine miles east and west, and its greatest
breadth about eight miles on the east, where it formed the
western boundary of Fortescue Straits. We named it after our good
ship "Basilisk"; and its highest peak, 900 feet high, Mount
Goodman, after our worthy Doctor. The soil is generally poor, and
it contained only three villages, but Mount Goodman is
extensively cultivated.</p>
<p>I named the bay after my coxswain, Jenkins; and the islands
scattered on its broad bosom after the boat's crew fine cheerful
young English seamen as ever pulled an oar. We found rest for the
night on a little luxuriant button of an islet in Jenkins Bay, a
high mound of rock and earth, about thirty yards in diameter, and
set to work to cook; it was a good spot, and our fire soon burned
cheerily. The place swarmed with pigeons, of which Mr. Mourilyan
shot a goodly bag, that vastly assisted our supper; and here I
may remark that the quantity of fresh food procured by our guns
had certainly an influence on the health of the boats' crews
employed in detached work. We hauled our boats off after supper,
and anchored just over the exquisite grottoes, and bright-painted
gardens of a South Sea coral-bed. Every fragile branch and
blossom shimmered up through the still water in intense
moonlight, and little fishes glided between, azure-blue, purple,
crimson, and golden beautiful as rainbows. But there were
creatures yet more lovely&mdash;small animalcul&aelig;, that shot
about like flashes of living light. Literally like living light,
and more beautiful than I can describe, are these little
phosphoric things, which do not emit a steady ray but seem to
palpitate light. When seen quiescent they look like tiny motes of
silver, then they throb, and throb, swelling larger, and
brighter, with every effort, and stream away at last in a train
of splendour. We finished our evening with an impromptu
penny-reading, followed by many songs, and as the last notes died
away in silence, we stretched ourselves on the thwarts and oars
to sleep.</p>
<p>Next morning was Sunday; and up to this time we had always,
when possible, made a point of keeping Sunday as a day of rest,
but as a ship prosecutes her voyage on Sunday so our boats had
now to go on with their work. After reading the proper morning
prayers, we continued to track Jenkins Bay round, and watch for
what it would develop; and the farther we went the more the
formation of the land led us to suppose that even now we had not
found the real terminating point of New Guinea. After pulling six
or seven miles to the west, we found our conjectures verified by
the discovery of a clear broad blue channel, two miles wide,
leading fair from sea to sea&mdash;fit for a fleet to pass
through under sail. Our hearts filled with delight and wonder as
we looked. There and then I named it China Straits; the wish
being father to the thought, that I had found a new highway
between Australia and China.</p>
<p>Before reaching China Straits our fresh water had all been
used, and our efforts to find a supply on shore had failed; for
there are no villages in Jenkins Bay. To get water was a
necessity, so seeing one of the large trading canoes standing in
for China Straits, we gave chase, to the great alarm of its crew,
who numbered about fifteen, and had several women and children on
board. There was no wind, so we soon came alongside, and when the
astonished creatures found that we meant no harm, they gladly
supplied us with water from cocoa-nuts, the orifices of which
were stopped with grass, and pointing to a large village in China
Straits, made signs that we could obtain plenty there.
Accordingly, we pulled in for the western shore of this third new
island, named by us after the senior lieutenant, "Hayter", by the
discovery of which we had now cut off in all forty miles from the
supposed length of New Guinea. As we approached the village,
which was situated partly on a small islet, and partly on the
mainland, to which it was joined by a reef, numbers of canoes
came out to meet us; manifesting some doubtfulness, until they
had communicated with their friends in the large trading canoe,
after which they became assured, and crowded round us. One old
bald-headed fellow jumped into the galley, and patting me in the
most friendly manner on the back, sat himself down, and pointed
the way over the fringing shore reef to the village, which was
large, and straggled for more than a mile round the shores. High
land rose immediately behind it; the highest point of which,
Mount Haines, is about 800 feet high, and cultivated in terraces
to its summit.</p>
<p>Two or three hundred natives-waited our landing, all of the
copper-coloured Malay type, carrying stone tomahawks over their
shoulders, but not showing any spears, or clubs. Women and
children were amongst the crowd, so I did not hesitate to land at
once; and leaving half the men to guard the boats, took the rest
up to a small stream shown us by the natives, where we got
water&mdash;they carrying our barricoes, and helping us in every
possible way. This done we began to barter with them for their
fine stone hatchets, their yams, cocoa-nuts, and large crabs,
with our iron hoop. We found the women, who were more ugly than
can well be described, with their close-cropped hair, blackened
skin, and mouths wholly disfigured by constant use of the
betel-nut, much more difficult to trade with than the men; and
they would not allow us to go near them as they sat on the
verandahs in front of their houses.</p>
<p>The stone axes we found here were the most perfect specimens I
have ever seen, and had been clipped into shape, and polished
with a skill that must have been the result of practice for ages.
The stone used was a kind of green-stone, hard, close-grained,
and susceptible of high polish, but liable to chip off in
irregular scales. The blades were some as large as seven inches
round the edge, narrowed to three at the hilt, the length from
edge to hilt was fifteen inches, and they tapered away in a
beautiful curve to a sharp edge; they were set into a cleft in a
handle, which described two sides of a triangle, and secured by
stripes of rattan. The axe was carried over the shoulder. The
southern entrance to China Straits is full of wooded islets, and
to one of these, named by us "Dinner Islet", about a mile in
length, and 200 feet high, we went to dine, apart from our savage
friends; but we were followed there by the fighting men to the
number of about 100. As they seemed in nowise alarmed themselves,
we only kept a little more together, and went on cooking our
dinner. We sat at the edge of the bush, under the shelter of
gigantic banyan trees, that dropped their hundred roots into the
soil beneath the white coral sand; and this was a strategic
position, for it kept the natives in our front, and prevented a
surprise&mdash;a point I was always particular in guarding, as
savages are never wholly to be trusted. They squatted between us
and the blue rippling water, watching all our proceedings with
intense curiosity, and expressed utter disgust on tasting our
dish, which was as delicious, according to our ideas, as ever
explorers sat to a stew made of preserved soup and potatoes, salt
pork, curlew, and pigeons. As we grew more friendly, several of
our men got into the native canoes to try their skill; and, after
a few attempts at paddling, were ignominiously capsised, to the
great amusement of the natives; and the rest of us were
surrounded by inquiring groups, who opened the breasts of our
shirts and stroked our white skin with much wonder and
admiration. The rest of the day was devoted to a cursory
examination of China Straits, which convinced me that the ship
could be taken through, and I determined at once to return to
her, hope again reviving that I might thus take her round to the
unknown coast-land to the north-west, which was not more than
twelve miles distant from China Straits. We were twenty miles
from the "Basilisk", but by dint of hard pulling, and favoured
occasionally by a little wind, we got back to the ship before
midnight, well pleased with our discoveries.</p>

<p><small>ON</small> the morning of the 21st we got the ship
under weigh, and took her through Fortescue Straits, now so
completely thrown into the shade, and passing to the westward
along the southern shores of Basilisk and Hayter Islands, found,
as I expected, a fine clear passage leading into China Straits.
We dropped anchor in a bay on the western shores of Hayter
Island, and looked round on the beautiful scene revealed to us
with a sanguine trust that our hopes of finding the desired
passage were at last to be realised.</p>
<p>The southern entrance to China Straits is guarded by Heath
Island a bold lofty island, 1000 feet high at its highest point,
and five miles in length, luxuriantly wooded, and having large
villages on its northern slopes, surrounded by cultivated ground.
Many islets and coral sandbanks offer the most lovely little boat
harbours off the northern shores of Heath Island, and the sea
that surrounds it on the south, east, and west, is enriched with
many islands that vary in size, form, and colouring. Turning from
these, and looking northward up China Straits, the eye rests
first on two salient features at their entrance. On the left hand
a great rounded, almost perpendicular mass, dips from a height of
2000 feet into the blue waters of the Strait. This great bluff is
the real and majestic terminating point of the Owen Stanley
Range, and of south-east New Guinea itself. It is covered with
sombre monotonous forest, and contrasts strongly with Hayter
Island, which fronts it on the right side of the entrance, and is
much lower land; its culminating peak, Mount Haines, being but
800 feet high, whilst its surface is varied by being broken up
into heights, wooded or bare, or cultivated in patches, and the
whole is enlivened by picturesque villages.</p>
<p>Twenty miles to the north the view up the Straits is closed by
the lofty purple peaks of a then unknown land. Between us and
these peaks lay first the broad southern entrance to the Straits,
then six miles of narrow river-like scenery, terminating in the
northern entrance, which was sprinkled over with a fresh group of
islets.</p>
<p>We had many doubts at first as to whether the great bluff
which overlooks the western entrance of China Straits was indeed
part of New Guinea, and not another island, we had been so often
mistaken; but the work of the ensuing days convinced us, and
proved also that China Straits offered a wide safe channel, by
which ships, as I then thought, could gain the northern shores of
New Guinea, and I trusted that we had indeed found the passage I
desired, and that these Straits would form the highway of a new
route.</p>
<p>The importance of our discoveries led me to consider their
bearing on Imperial and Australian interests. There lay the vast
island of New Guinea, dominating the shores of northern
Australia, separated at one point by only twenty miles of coral
reef from British possessions, commanding the Torres Straits
route, the transit of the Queensland mails, and our
newly-discovered route for Australian trade to China; commanding
the rich and increasing pearl-shell fisheries, with the working
of which we had obtained a complete and interesting acquaintance,
and also the b&ecirc;che-de-mer fishery, which furnishes an
important article of export to China.</p>
<p>I felt that the occupation of this island by any foreign
maritime power, more especially since the discovery of the
"Basilisk's" harbours and anchorages, would be a standing menace
to Queensland.</p>
<p>I was also impressed by the richness and beauty of the new
islands, and the number of their vegetable products&mdash;fine
timber, the cocoa-nut, the sago-palm, sugar-cane, maize, jute,
and various vegetable fibres, fruits and rich grasses, and my
conclusion, after weighing all the considerations involved was,
that it was my duty to take formal possession of our discoveries
in the name of Her Majesty. Such a course secured a postponement
of occupation by any Power till our Government could consider its
own interests, and whilst the acquisition of these islands might
commend itself, and my act result in annexation on the one hand,
it might be negatived on the other, with easy simplicity, by a
neglect to confirm it.</p>
<p>On April 24th we made the best dispositions we could to give
some little eclât to the ceremony of taking possession.</p>
<p>The trunk of a tall cocoa-nut tree, deprived of its crown,
standing on the west beach of Hayter Island, was fitted with a
block to be used as a flag-staff; officers, marines, and
small-armed men landed under arms, and all standing uncovered,
the following proclamation was read&mdash;</p>
<p>"I, JOHN MORESBY, captain in the royal navy, commanding Her
Majesty's ship 'Basilisk', having discovered three considerable
islands, from henceforth to be known as Moresby, Hayter, and
Basilisk islands, off the east coast of New Guinea, together with
various groups of detached islets, and deeming that the
possession of these islands may hereafter prove of considerable
importance, do hereby, by right of discovery, take possession of
all the aforesaid islands and islets, lying within the parallels
of 10&deg; 25' and 10&deg; 40' south latitude, and between the
meridians of 150&deg; 35' and 151&deg; 20' east longitude, in the
name and on behalf of her most gracious Majesty Queen Victoria,
her heirs and successors, in token whereof I have hoisted and
saluted the British flag on the shores of these islands.</p>
<p>"<i>God save the Queen</i>. "H.M.S. 'Basilisk', Possession
Bay, "Hayter Island, April 24th, 1873."</p>
<p>The Jack was then run up and saluted, and three hearty cheers
were given. All listened to the few sentences read with attention
and with pleasure, for every man present had a right to identify
himself with the work done. A <i>feu-de-joie</i> was then fired,
and I said, "Lads, in honour of what the old 'Basilisk' has done,
we will splice the main brace to-night", and so our little
ceremony ended.</p>
<p>The few natives present had watched our proceedings with
amazement, little guessing how much their own future was
involved, but the firing and cheering sent them off frightened
into the bush.</p>
<p>We named the bay in which we had anchored Possession Bay, in
honour of the event. Here, at the foot of a mountain torrent,
which formed a succession of deep pools, in running down its
rocky channel on the side of Mount Haines, we dug a deep well for
the convenience of future visitors.</p>
<p>Dr. Haines and I changed to our cool working clothes after the
ceremony, and started to reach the summit of the hill which bears
his name. Taking a native track which led at first beside the
rocky channel of the stream, but soon deviated from it, and led
through forest to enclosures of sugar-cane and banana, we came
out quite unexpectedly on a small village of the usual kind,
consisting of long tunnel-shaped houses, standing on poles, and
surrounded by cocoa-nut trees. On a rocky ledge above the village
stood a group of natives, armed with spears and wooden clubs,
evidently! waiting our approach. We were rather taken aback at
this, for we were quite unarmed; but we put on a bold face, and
walked towards them, making the usual grotesque sign of greeting.
They were evidently dubious as to how to act, but consented
presently to point out our way; they would not accompany us,
however, but stood and watched us with doubtful faces till we
were lost to sight. The village stood about two-thirds from the
hill top, and the remaining height was roughly terraced, and
planted with yam, sugar-cane, and taro, which were growing
luxuriantly. The view from the top rewarded us for our
climbing&mdash;groups of islands were in sight that had no
existence on the chart, and away to the north-west stretched the
unknown land that now drew all my desires. To the south the
islands of the Louisiade group studded the blue expanse; to the
east lay Jenkins' Bay, with its islets, bays, and coves, backed
up by the bold wooded outlines of Moresby and Basilisk Islands,
which lay asleep in sunshine; to the north the unvisited
D'Entrecasteaux Islands reared lofty lengths of deep violet blue;
to the west our noble China Straits streamed northward from
beneath the mighty bluff that terminates the Owen Stanley Range,
all clothed in solemn forest to the foot. The more I gazed on all
this grandeur and beauty, the more persuaded was I that these
islands will some day become English homes; for all the
conditions were here, beauty of aspect, high land, unbounded
fertility, position on an open sea, and at the entrance of the
shortest route between Australia and China. I felt that the
future might safely be trusted to time.</p>
<p>Having completed our surveys, we left China Straits by its
northern entrance on April 25th, and rounding the great bluff end
of New Guinea, which we named the North Foreland, we considered
ourselves now fairly to the north of that vast island, and stood
west, keeping close to the New Guinea shore, for it was evident
that the channel would not be a broad one which separated the
unknown land, so often observed by us, from the north coast of
New Guinea. After much deliberation, we had come to the
conclusion that this unknown land was a part of the
D'Entrecasteaux group, not seen by D'Entrecasteaux, as he only
passed by the eastern shores of the group.</p>
<p>We were anxious now to prove whether the D'Entrecasteaux
Islands was an integral part of New Guinea, or could be resolved
into separate islands. Our sailing directions inclined to the
first belief, but the chart, copied from the French, showed
islands there. The shore that we were coasting was wooded,
precipitously steep, and falling sheer into the sea, which had a
depth of ninety fathoms at a cable's length from the shore.</p>
<p>Ten miles to the west of China Straits, a powerful mountain
torrent, dashing down through a gorge, formed a small lagoon at
its mouth, which offered the chance of an anchorage being found
in alluvial deposit at its entrance. The weather had turned out
thick and squally, so I wished if possible to anchor here till it
cleared, as well as to replenish our stock of water from so
bountiful a source, and we stood in cautiously till our
mast-heads seemed almost to mingle with the dense foliage of an
overhanging hill, and dropped anchor in eighteen fathoms, off the
entrance of the lagoon. The officer in charge of the two boats
sent for water&mdash;not an Irishman&mdash;took them into the
lagoon, and loaded them deeply, and this done found himself a
prisoner, as they would not now float over the bar at the
entrance. He had therefore to discharge his cargo and load again
outside, and was chaffed most unmercifully for his exploit. We
were weather-bound here for twenty-four hours, and some of us
took occasion to climb up along the course of the torrent for two
or three miles, till we were stopped by perpendicular cliffs some
hundreds of feet in height, over which the torrent rolled from
various channels, and broke into soft showers of spray. All about
us stretched thick forest and jungle, full of an oppressive
silence, only broken by the occasional scream of some parrot from
a high tree top. There were no fish in the torrent, and we washed
the sand in places for gold, but none was found. One of our
exploring parties found a small village in a deep narrow valley.
It was ill built, and its people were dirtier, and seemed more
savage, and slightly darker in complexion than the Moresby Island
natives. They were much alarmed on seeing our party, but were
assured after a little, and brought crabs and oysters, and bird
of paradise plumes, off to the ship in wretched little canoes.
The weather cleared on the afternoon of April 27th, and we
weighed and continued to run up what we supposed was a strait
leading between New Guinea and the D'Entrecasteaux. The land was
closing in on us, and was soon not more than eight miles apart;
and as headland after headland opened out, all hands watched with
interest for the secret to reveal itself; all the officers were
on the bridge, and the men crowded the bulwarks. It was one of
those exciting moments which rarely occur and are never
forgotten. The scene was indeed beautiful; the New Guinea
mountains had receded from the sea, and left behind them a strip
of rich plain country, strewn with villages, and beautified with
groves of palm, behind which the Owen Stanley mountains swelled
again into noble height, and this made a sharp contrast with the
northern shore, where the land was broken and rugged, and rose
into lesser heights. Before us, to the north-west, lay a group of
small islets in a stream of light from the setting sun. On the
near shore the natives, excited beyond expression, raced along
the black volcanic sand, brandishing club and spear as we passed.
The mountain streams, swollen by the late rain, brought down
floods of discoloured water, which we crossed with anxious
hearts, not knowing what it might hide; but at last, passing
another headland, we saw the blue distant hills to the westward
meet the unknown land and touch, and knew that we had only sailed
up a great unknown bay, and that the north side of New Guinea was
yet to be reached.</p>
<p>My disappointment was extreme. I had set my heart on China
Straits forming the noble passage which nature had seemed to
intend to be the northern shores of New Guinea, but all was once
more thrown into doubt and uncertainty. Pressing on in hope of
getting to an anchorage before dark&mdash;so necessary in these
narrow waters&mdash;we came in sight of the head of this great
bay, which was closed to the west by a considerable extent of
flat country, backed by a range of high mountains, which ran
south till it joined the Owen Stanley range, and north to the
high land which forms the northern shores of this bay, and was
afterwards named Stirling Range. The waters at the head of the
bay were dotted with ugly-looking reefs, and were far too deep
for anchorage; but our good star prevailed, and we opened a
lovely oval-shaped cove, on the shore of which was a large
well-constructed village, standing as usual amid tropic
surroundings. Mr. Mourilyan went at once to examine the tiny bay,
which lies about twenty miles west of China Straits, and though
half its space was blocked by a long reef, there remained a space
in which the "Basilisk", accustomed as she now was to narrow
waters, might make herself at home. Passing so close to a lovely
green point fringed with black sand that the gesticulating
natives might have thrown their spears on our decks, we entered
the little bay and anchored in twelve fathoms, our stern just
swinging clear of the beach in eight fathoms. Words fail to
describe the feeling of rest and satisfaction we felt on reaching
such a secure haven as this after our work amongst unknown
waters, when the responsibility I had taken added to my
anxieties.</p>
<p>The cove we had entered was semi-circular, and fringed all
round by graceful cocoa-nut palms, the blue water rippling up to
their roots. Pretty native houses were scattered amongst the
trees, every one of which seemed to have sent forth its inmates
to gaze at us. There was no unfriendliness; canoes of all sizes,
and catamarans darted about us, bringing fine pigs and
vegetables, which were gladly exchanged for our hoop-iron. The
next day was Sunday; but except during divine service, when we
sent the natives away, their jabbering over the bartering kept
the noise of a fair about us all day. I disliked the turning of
Sunday into a market-day, but the natives would have thought us
offended with them and retained a bad impression had I stopped
the trading; and our seamen, deprived of the only pleasure the
incessant nature of their work permitted, would have hated the
day. Half our men spent the afternoon on shore and thoroughly
enjoyed themselves. Mr. Mourilyan took the galley and surveyed
the head of Milne Bay (thus named by me after the Senior Naval
Lord of the Admiralty) on Monday, and came back with a report
that it was full of reefs, and that the natives had been
troublesome in pressing on him. I was too ill to go with him from
the effect of sundry bruises and strains received during the last
fortnight in climbing and other work, added to which I had been
attacked by one of our usual enemies, a tumour, which had fallen
in the right ear; but the work was in safe hands.</p>
<p>We had quite a scene during his absence, caused by the manning
and arming of our boats, which went outside the cove for target
firing. The natives had crowded down to the point near the boats,
curious as to what was to happen, and at the first report of the
sharp ringing Armstrong guns, had shrieked in terror and
scampered off. The panic seized the village, all valuables were
hurriedly taken away, and every living thing cleared out and made
for the bush, except a few women, who finding that no harm came
to them, stayed on the point, and watched the firing to the end.
I was well enough to land, and found several natives in the rear
of the village in a state of alarm, but the presence of the brave
women who had watched the firing and our signs, and a few
presents given, soon brought them round, and they accompanied us
back to the village, and were persuaded to venture alongside the
ship as usual. In the evening we had the satisfaction of seeing
the natives bring back their valuables, and before dark their
confidence was quite restored. Tuesday was devoted to a survey of
our anchorage, after which it received the name of Discovery Bay.
The catamarans here are made of three or more cocoa-nut trees
lashed together and sharpened at the ends. Some have a small
platform about a foot high in the centre, on which to carry the
goods dry, but most are without this, and the sea washes freely
over them. They require careful handling, but were freely used by
our men and officers.</p>

<br>
<small>DISCOVERY BAY, NEW GUINEA</small></p>
<br>
<p>The natives of Discovery Bay were friendly from the first.
They were similar in appearance to those we had as yet met on
this coast. Their numbers on board and alongside amounted at
times to three and four hundred, who kept us plied with their
merchandise, ornaments, weapons, and their beautiful canoe
paddles, which were shaped like the long narrow leaves of some
water plants, with a spine running down the centre. As a rule
they traded honestly. Our method was to drop a piece of iron hoop
at the end of a cord into a canoe, on which the natives would
touch one article after another till consent was nodded from the
ship, and then joyfully detach the iron and tie on the pig, yams,
or ornaments sold, to be hauled up. Our men, when on shore, used
to sit down freely and partake with them of their evening
meal&mdash;a mess of yams and vegetables, to which pork was
sometimes added, seasoned with cocoa-nut finely shred over, and
cooked in large earthen bowls. The mess was eaten with exquisite
little spoons cut out of pearl shell, and made a meal not to be
despised. The women generally presided at the feast, and the men
looked well pleased to see the children receiving their shares in
little cocoa-nut basins; indeed, their whole manner spoke well
for their treatment of these weaker ones.</p>
<p>I never saw Indian corn used as food, nor did it appear to be
cultivated in large quantities. The most palatable native dish
was made of the mamy apple, stewed. Our friends were always
anxious to be rid of us at dusk, and would make signs that they
wanted to sleep, op which we always conformed to their wish. It
was amusing to see our men come paddling off to the ship in
catamarans and canoes, the natives screaming with delight as a
clumsy stroke sent some frail craft rolling over. They always
came to the rescue though&mdash;righted the canoe, and gave it
some sharp jerks backward and forward, checking it abruptly, so
that the water was projected over each way, and then a man got in
and baled it out.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that our men were allowed to be at the
mercy of the natives, for savages, as I have said, are never to
be trusted. Armed boat-keepers always kept the boats ready for
instant embarkation; the liberty-men were told off into two
companies, each under the command of an officer, who had orders
to keep his men generally together, and to serve as a
rallying-point in case of need. These parties were sub-divided
into fours, which were ordered never to separate, and every
second man carried firearms. The completeness of our precautions
was happily never tested a fact owing as much to the
unexceptionable good behaviour and prudence of our men as to the
friendliness of the natives. It is a gratifying reflection to me
that, during the constant intercourse maintained by our men with
the New Guinea people, they never offered the slightest insult,
nor quarrelled with a native man or woman. The war canoes at
Discovery Bay were very remarkable, and were carefully kept under
sheds between the houses. They were from fifty to sixty feet
long, dug out of a single tree, with topside planking laced on.
The ends were ornamented with high movable prow and stern pieces,
grotesquely carved and painted, from which cassowary feathers
floated, and all round the sides of the boat strings of white
cowrie shells were looped up.</p>
<p>We saw a tomb here, the first since our leaving Teste Island;
evidently the grave of a great man. A small space inside the
village, about ten feet by five, was enclosed, in which stood a
miniature house, neatly made, and painted with ochres and lime,
covering the remains. Two or three pretty shrubs were planted in
the enclosure, and the whole was kept in good order. We
afterwards saw similar graves in the Engineer group, adorned with
strings of cocoa-nuts; otherwise no burial-places were seen, and
we were unable to learn from the natives how they disposed of
their dead. We never saw any sign of religious observance amongst
these people, unless the cocoa-nuts hung on poles on the reefs or
on their houses were intended as a propitiatory offering; and
there was also a peculiar ceremony to which I shall presently
allude. They had many pets, tame cassowaries, which ran about the
village freely, several varieties of the (Wallis) custus, and
some exquisitely plumaged birds, which they kept in wicker
cages.</p>
<p>Having completed our survey of this part of Milne Bay, we left
our pleasant anchorage on April 30th, to trace its northern
shores to their eastern termination. The width of Milne Bay at
Discovery Bay is about six miles; and we stood to the north-east,
sufficiently near to take the bearings of the prominent
headlands. Unfortunately it came on thick and rainy, and we were
obliged to seek shelter amidst the group of islands we had seen
from the entrance of China Straits, about twenty miles north-east
of Discovery Bay. Passing over some dangerous coral patches, we
found a good anchorage between the principal island and the
mainland. The group consisted of three larger islands, about a
mile in length, and several smaller ones, and was named Killerton
group by us. Its inhabitants at first seemed inclined to be
troublesome, and met our boats in canoes waving their stone
weapons, and shouting defiantly. Two or three canoes full of
fighting men came round Mr. Mourilyan's boat in a most
threatening manner; but his resoluteness and good temper told
after a while, and the natives began to consult with each other.
Some paddled off to shore and presently returned, bringing one of
the lean wolfish curs that infest their villages. They sprang up
the side of the "Basilisk", the leader carrying the dog in his
arms, and dashed out its brains on the quarterdeck, before any
one could stop them. On this all the natives near us changed
their manner, and showed a desire to be friendly, by making the
usual uncouth greeting; but the ire of the officer of the watch
and petty officers was so kindled at seeing Her Majesty's
quarter-deck defiled, that the dog-sacrificers and their friends
were bundled out of the ship at once, and their victim thrown
after them. I had been below at the time, and was sorry to hear
of this summary treatment, for I felt that the rite had,
doubtless, either a religious and sacrificial meaning to its
perpetrators, or was intended as a seal of amity between us. I
therefore went on shore immediately, to show friendliness, at a
spot where a large crowd had assembled round the body of the dead
dog in noisy consultation, and received so friendly a welcome,
that my companion and I did not hesitate to go on to the village
with our new acquaintances, who, similar in physique to their
neighbours, were painted in so extraordinary a manner as to look
more like monkeys than men. They had black lines like spectacle
rims drawn round their eyes, one cheek and half the chin was
painted white, and the other half and the nose black. One old
native led me by the hand, and the crowd followed us for about a
mile through sugar-cane plantations, melon, taro, and yam
gardens, interspersed with palms and fruit trees, to the village,
which is beautifully placed at the foot of a high range of hills,
and on the banks of a rapid stream. Many forest trees had been
suffered to remain in the cleared ground about it, and had
developed into more magnificent proportions than any trees I have
ever seen, not excepting the giant pines of California. Their
girth at a man's height from the ground is about thirty feet;
twenty feet above which the foliage commenced, and threw a shadow
on the ground about 100 feet in diameter. A large talking-house,
about sixty feet long, stood in the centre of the village, and
round it, on a hard trampled space, the saddle-roofed houses were
grouped. The natives had brought us to their village, but would
not let us enter their houses; and for this I could discover no
reason, as their women were all about us. I looked into several
of the houses, and could see nothing beyond the usual belongings,
weapons, fishing-nets, stores of yams, and lumps of sago wrapped
up in dried cocoa-nut leaves. As they would not admit us, we
leaned against a huge tree trunk, and made signs that we were
thirsty, when they brought us fresh cocoa-nut milk.</p>
<p>Returning on board, the remainder of the day was spent in
examining the various channels between the islets, but their
number obliged us to be cursory. The Torres Straits pigeon
swarmed on these islets. On May 1st the weather had cleared
sufficiently for us to make a fresh start, so keeping close along
the northern shores of Milne Bay, we made for the unknown
north-east point of New Guinea.</p>
<p>Immediately to the east of Killerton Islands the mountains
dropped from a height of near 2000 feet, and became low wooded
hills of 300 or 400 feet in height, with plains between; and we
began to feel that we were coasting a narrow neck of land, though
the water at the other side could not, of course, be seen. Coral
reefs and broken water were visible ahead, but we pushed on and
were soon rewarded. The land had now narrowed to about a mile in
width, of low undulating forest-country, sprinkled with villages.
Suddenly an abrupt double-topped hill sprang upward to a height
of 300 feet, with a village at its foot, half hidden in a grove
of bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees, and two small flat coral
islets off it; beyond them a broad strait rolled its waters for
eight miles, till it washed the shores of the D'Entrecasteaux
Group. My desire was answered; the true terminating point of New
Guinea was found; the D'Entrecasteaux Group lay afar, distinctly
separate, never more to be confounded with New Guinea, and ours
were the first European eyes which had looked on these things.
Continuing our course, I hoped to double East Cape, as the
terminating point was now named by us, and take the ship round to
the northern shores of New Guinea, but immediately to the
eastward of the cape we fell amongst the reefs before seen, and
being completely embayed by them were compelled to seek a
precarious anchorage to windward of one of the small coral islets
off East Cape, on which a strong monsoon was blowing.</p>

<p><small>NEW GUINEA</small> was now known by us to be
fork-shaped to the east; the lower prong consisting of Moresby,
Hayter, Basilisk, and other islands&mdash;the upper, of a long
narrowing strip of land, ending in the double-topped point to
which we now gave the name of East Cape; and between these prongs
lay Milne Bay. Our next efforts were directed to find a channel
through the reefs which had so unfortunately obstructed us, but
the more we searched the clearer it became that no channel round
East Cape existed here. I was confident that a way would be
found, on search being made, farther to the southward and
eastward, but having a distance of about 2000 miles to accomplish
against the monsoon, before a further supply of coal and stores
could be obtained; and it being necessary that I should be at
Cape York in a few days, I had neither the time nor means to make
it.</p>
<p>With great reluctance, therefore, I abandoned the idea of
taking the ship farther, and thought that the elucidation of this
part of the new route was reserved for some happier navigator,
possessed of means and leisure. The importance of such a
discovery, in shortening the route to China, and opening up the
rich New Guinea coast to trade, impressed itself so much on my
mind that I resolved to suggest to Admiral Sir Alexander Milne
the advisability of allowing me to try if I could not find my way
to England by the new route, when the ship's time was expiring,
instead of taking the usual course from Australia round Cape
Horn. This application was afterwards made by me, and permission
given, of which the result will be told farther on. Before
turning my back on Eastern New Guinea, I resolved on visiting its
unknown northern shores in my boat. The ship was riding uneasily
at her exposed anchorage, and a disagreeable sea was running, but
it did not prevent the natives coming off in their frail canoes
and catamarans to communicate.</p>
<p>Taking Mr. Bentley in the galley, I rounded East Cape, passing
between it and the Island off which we were anchored by a narrow
channel, where a hollow dangerous sea was running; passing this
we shot under the lee of East Cape, and found ourselves in a
moment sheltered, and floating on a deep, tranquil sea, ruffled
but gently by the monsoon.</p>
<p>Full of pleasant excitement, we lay on our oars to take in the
exquisite scene revealed. Behind us, on a breaking sea, the tall
masts of the ship were rocking to and fro over the coral islet,
whilst we lay motionless. To the eastward rose the lofty wooded
D'Entrecasteaux Islands; within a hundred yards of us a large
village lay peacefully amongst its palms and fruit
trees&mdash;its canoes floating before it, full of anxious
gazers; on and on the eye travelled to the westward, from the
near thickly-populated shores to the blue shadowy outlines of the
massive New Guinea mountains, seventy or eighty miles distant.
The sight of a clear reefless sea, added to the exhilaration we
felt, but it enhanced the disappointment of thinking that not to
us would be given the honour of bringing a ship into these
waters. Fate proved kinder to us afterwards than we then
expected. We steered to the west for several miles along a shore
more luxuriant and beautiful than words can describe, and then
returned and landed at the village of East Cape, where the
natives came down in numbers to meet us, and crowding Around like
a number of delighted children, led us to their village, where
mats were spread for us under the shade of great cocoa-nut trees.
Then they examined us from our hats to our shoes in the most
minute manner, wondering over everything, especially at our white
skins; the young women, who were agreeable enough looking, and
had beautifully small hands and feet, being specially interested.
We decorated some of the babes with strips of turkey red, on
which our popularity became unbounded, and all the mothers came
round us holding up their copper-coloured, dark-eyed, babes. We
shared their evening meal, and returned to the ship, voting the
East Cape people the pleasantest savages we had ever met. The
ship lay uneasily at her anchor, but next day the strong monsoon
which was blowing moderated, and Mr. Mourilyan and I were able to
leave her, and explore to the west along the north shore of New
Guinea. We passed between East Cape and the two outlying islets,
and ran some fourteen miles to the west, along a
thickly-populated, well cultivated coast, without meeting a
single outlying reef&mdash;the narrow shore reef dropping down
"steep-to", into a depth that gave us no bottom, with thirty
fathoms of line. We made a running survey as we passed along the
north coast of the narrow neck of land, which, as I have before
said, encloses Milne Bay on the north, and terminates north-east
New Guinea; and, disregarding many invitations of the natives to
land at their villages, pushed on to a mountain, which, rising in
the rear of Killerton Islands, throws a ridge into the northern
sea. This mountain was intended by me to be the limit point of
our work in this cruise, the boats having to return against the
monsoon. We rested and dined under its shadow, in as perfect a
little boat-harbour as ever mortal eyes beheld; shaded overhead
by the foliage of overhanging trees, with two fathoms depth of
water round the boat, through which a perfect forest of branching
coral glimmered up. This point was the western limit actually
reached by us, but we named a cape, seen by us some fifteen miles
beyond, Cape Basilisk.</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Mourilyan had sketched the D'Entrecasteaux
group, as seen from this position, we turned our faces towards
the ship, with many regrets at being forced to leave this
unexplored coast behind us, and returned, landing at some of the
villages on our way, where we found the people as gentle and
friendly as possible. At times I found myself drawing a contrast
between the squalid poverty, too often seen in humble life in
England, and the plenty and cleanliness that met us here at every
step, where the small cane houses lay in valleys rich as the
garden of Eden, and no man had to go more than a stone's throw
from his own door to find all the necessities of his simple
life.</p>
<p>They possess cocoa-nuts, the bread-fruit, citron, oranges, and
sago, by the bounty of nature, and they cultivate yams, taro,
bananas, and various other roots which we found very good to eat,
but were unable to name. They are great fishers and traders,
passing from island to island in large canoes, forty or fifty
feet long, made of a hollowed tree, with top sides secured by
cane lacing and large wooden knees. They use a great oval-shaped
mat sail, and handle it so skilfully, that when we met them at
sea, and the "Basilisk" was going five knots, they easily sailed
round us, and luffing under our lee were with difficulty
prevented from boarding us whilst under weigh. What have these
people to gain from civilisation? Pondering on the fate of other
aboriginal races when brought into contact with the white, I was
ready to wish that their happy homes had never been seen by us;
but considerations of this kind cannot be entertained by those
who see a simple duty before them, and have means to execute it;
we were not responsible for the issues, and Providence may surely
be trusted-to work out its own ends.</p>
<p>The great Owen Stanley range may be said to terminate at the
head of Milne Bay, but one of its spurs, named by me Sterling
Range, runs at a diminished elevation through this new neck of
land or narrow peninsula which terminates in East Cape. The
double-topped hill which marks this henceforth important
promontory on the map of the world, was crowned to the summits,
when first we saw it, with tropical forest, but the noble trees
afterwards fell to our axes, as we made it a theodolite
station.</p>
<p>I left East Cape with the "Basilisk", May 3d, which was marked
by an unlucky accident; for in trying to weigh our anchor we lost
it, through its catching in a coral rock, and the chain carrying
away. Running a fresh line of soundings across Milne Bay, we
re-entered China Straits, and re-anchored in Possession Bay,
where five days were spent in watering, and further-examination
of the surrounding coast.</p>
<p>We felt that we had much reason to be satisfied with the
results obtained in our cruises, especially that, as Englishmen,
we had secured to our country a right to take possession of a
territory that will every day become more important to Australia;
and had found safe commodious harbours, by means of which a
healthy commerce might be carried on.</p>
<p>The ship was full of strange pets and curiosities. The most
remarkable of the pets was a cassowary from Cornwallis Island;*
there were some New Guinea pigs, some varieties of cuscus, and
any amount of birds. We had stone and wood weapons and
instruments of all kinds; amongst which the large greenstone axes
used by the natives in making canoes were the most conspicuous
the blades very sharp, and the stone resembling the prized
greenstone of New Zealand. We had canoe paddles made of a fine
dark wood, shaped like a long water leaf, and well carved, which
were really graceful objects. There were gourds of all sizes and
shapes, with patterns delicately burnt out, ornamenting the whole
surface; cocoa-nuts, used to carry water, and carved all over;
bowls of red fire-baked clay, such as the women may at any time
be seen making in the villages; baskets also, made of sinnet,
lined with the envelope of the young leaf of the palm, and
fitting compactly one inside the other, to form a large set;
netted bags, fish-hooks, and bait, carved out of pearl-shell;
plumes of the cassowary and red bird of paradise; fillets for the
head, and breastplates made of fibre, and beautifully embroidered
with shells and berries.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Now in the Zoological Gardens, London.]</p>
<p>The day before we finally sailed from Possession Bay, one of
our stokers wandered away by himself when on shore, in
disobedience of the general orders, and was relieved by a party
of natives of all the iron hoop he had about him. I mention this
as being the only instance in which they took advantage of their
superior numbers.</p>
<p>Having paid our last visit to the villages, we weighed and
stood south; but wishing to ascertain whether a passage into
China Straits existed on the west side of Heath Island, took the
ship out by this untried channel. We got out in safety, but had
to pass over the tail of some dangerous reefs, which it required
much conning from aloft to avoid. Fifteen miles south of Heath
Island we crossed the line of the sunken barrier reef in
seventeen fathoms water, and looking back could more easily
understand from the configuration of the land, how it was that
our predecessors in these seas, viewing it from a distance, had
mistaken the facts.</p>
<p>It was a relief to feel our good ship once more rising and
falling on the free ocean swell; but I left New Guinea with
regrets for what we had left undone, thinking that I should never
see it again.</p>
<p>A pleasant passage of ten days brought us once more to an
anchor at Somerset, where our hearts were rejoiced by an
accumulation of three months' home letters. Here
Navigating-Lieutenant Connor and Mr. Grant rejoined, after
laborious work on the northern shores of Torres Straits, where
they had spent two months in open boats, exposed to unusual
severity of weather on a lee-shore during the south-east monsoon;
but in spite of difficulties they had accomplished a
trigonometrical survey of 46 miles of the great Warrior Reef, and
148 miles of the south coast of New Guinea and islands, including
those of Cornwallis and Saibai, which had been placed on the
chart by the "Basilisk". They had not met with any trouble from
the natives, who had been quite friendly all through; and the
health of the men had been excellent. They would scarcely have
been recognised by their nearest friends, so tanned were they by
sun and wind; but they were happily none the worse for their work
Navigating-Lieutenant Connor's labours had added so largely to
the amount of our geographical work, that I felt rewarded a
hundred times over for the anxiety and responsibility I had
accepted in detaching him in so unusual a manner.</p>
<p>Having made a tour of all the pearl-shelling and
b&ecirc;che-de-mer stations before sailing for New Guinea, on our
return to Cape York I drew Mr. Jardine's attention to the fishery
question. All fishing operations were now suspended till the
receipt of government licences. The Polynesian islanders had been
freed from their servitude and sent to their homes; and the law
had now provided such enactments as would secure righteous
treatment for them in case of their making a compact to serve
their old masters again. The Torres Straits islanders entertained
a perfectly-friendly feeling towards the white men stationed on
their islands, and were willing and anxious to serve them for
fair pay; whilst such service would be useful in civilising them,
by adding to their comfort in the present, and affording
opportunities for their gradual moral elevation. Under these
circumstances I felt the importance of setting the fishing
establishments free to work again without further delay, lest an
industry so valuable in its results should be paralysed; and
urged Mr. Jardine to grant such temporary licences as his powers
permitted, for the employment of Torres Straits natives: this
after some difficulty he did.</p>
<p>On the 24th we bid what all hands hoped might be an eternal
farewell to Somerset. Indeed, what with the bad anchorage,
ruinous aspect of the buildings, and want of any kind of fruit or
vegetable, there is little to make a stay cheerful or
comfortable. Falling short of coal on our return, we anchored
under the lee of Gloucester Island for four days, and cut a
supply of wood. On June 21st we arrived at Brisbane, where we
were received with the utmost kindness by the governor and Mr.
Palmer, who took a most generous view of the importance of our
services. On the 2d July our eventful six months' cruise came to
an end, and we took up our old position in Farm Cove, Sydney. The
ship was of course thronged by people coming to hear something
about New Guinea, and to see the curiosities we had brought
thence, and many of the seamen drove lucrative bargains with the
Sydney people. One, in particular, received five pounds, as I was
afterwards informed, for a New Guinea pig, which was immediately
shaved by its purchaser, painted in stripes of different colours,
and otherwise decorated. A small tent was then set up in one of
the principal thoroughfares, and the proprietor informed the
public that a wonderful striped New Guinea pig, brought by H.M.
ship "Basilisk", was on view, and charged sixpence a-head for
entrance, with a result that was said to have answered his most
sanguine expectations.</p>
<p>At Sydney, in accordance with orders awaiting us, we refitted
and proceeded to New Zealand, where we remained till December
1st, making a tour of the New Zealand ports. At Auckland, on the
1st, we received the English mail and were joined by Lieutenant
Dawson, Admiralty Surveyor, who had been sent out to assist us,
my desire having been assented to, that we should return to
England by the route which I believed would be found to exist
round the east end of New Guinea. We were ordered to spend six
weeks in making additional surveys on the New Guinea coast, and
Lieutenant Dawson came provided with a supply of the best
surveying instruments for the purpose. I ought here to express my
sense of gratitude to Admiral Richards, late Hydrographer of the
navy, for kindly giving us some surveying instruments on our
leaving England, which I asked for, on the chance of their
proving useful, little thinking how much I should need them.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Dawson had only given me this news unofficially,
and our orders had gone on to Commodore Goodenough, whom I knew
to be at Fiji, so that two or three months must elapse before I
could receive them from him, by waiting which time I should lose
the fine weather season in New Guinea, which was all important to
the success of the work entrusted to us.</p>
<p>I was loath to shorten by a day the pleasures of our stay in
this colony, for officers and men deserved a little enjoyment and
rest; besides, we were the only man-of-war in New Zealand, and
the rule was stringent that New Zealand was never to be left
without a man-of-war; but having weighed all considerations, I
telegraphed to Sir James Fergusson, Governor of New Zealand, who
was then at Christ Church, to ask if the colony could spare us,
whilst I took the ship to Fiji to communicate with the Commodore.
Sir James, who had taken a warm interest in our New Guinea work,
answered, saying that we could be spared, and we started at once
for Fiji, coaling at the Bay of Islands on our way thither.</p>
<p>On December 21st, at 1 <small>A.M</small>., we were standing
for Levuku, with studding sails set in a light fair breeze, when
we unexpectedly found ourselves close to a dangerous reef, having
been swept twelve miles out of our reckoning by an unsuspected
current. Before the ship could answer her helm she was on the
reef, and lay there bumping for six hours before we could get her
off. It was a terribly anxious time; for some hours I thought the
good old vessel's hours were numbered, but fine weather
continuing, the efforts we made were successful.</p>
<p>We arrived at Levuku next day, and I was gratified by finding
that the commodore approved of my proceeding in leaving New
Zealand, and was prepared by every means in his power to assist
in promoting the success of the expedition, by helping me to
carry out my views, and aiding me with his own valuable
advice.</p>

<p><small>ONE</small> of H.M. schooners, the "Sandfly", commanded
by Lieutenant Nowell, was ordered to accompany the "Basilisk" to
New Guinea, and the Commodore kindly offered to give us the
assistance of H.M.S. "Rosario", an intention, of which after
circumstances prevented the fulfilment. Encouraged thus by the
good wishes of my old friend and esteemed chief, we sailed,
December 26th, to refit and prepare for the expedition. On our
passage a singular alarm happened. A heavy sea struck the ship
and shook her violently at night, and the men having the memory
of our many narrow escapes in their minds, raised a cry that she
had struck on a reef, and rushed on deck to get heartily laughed
at by the watch. We reached Sydney January 6th, and found the
public prints full of articles, which showed the interest taken
in our late New Guinea work, and expressed hope for our future
success, which it almost depressed me to read, knowing, as I did,
the short time placed at my disposal by the Admiralty. My
experience in former cruises had shown me that a steam pinnace
was a necessity, and the Commodore being unable to supply me, I
resolved to buy one here, hoping after our survey was over, to
reimburse myself by selling it to the Dutch at Amboyna.</p>
<p>I was unable to see anything suitable, except one which
belonged to the New South Wales Government, and this was lent me
through the kindness of Sir Hercules Robinson, the governor, and
Mr. Parkes, prime minister, on my making myself personally
responsible in case of damage or loss, and undertaking to return
her to Sydney after we had reached Singapore. I was but too glad
to accept these or any conditions. The Government also supplied
me with a deep-sea sounding apparatus, and by permission of the
Commodore we were also provided with deep sea lines, and an
abundance of saws and axes for cutting wood, which I foresaw
would be often a necessity in the work before us. When the ship
was docked for repairs, we found that our escape from the Figi
coral-reef had been of the narrowest, as the planking had been
all but ground through.</p>
<p>H.M.S. schooner "Sandfly" sailed for Possession Bay, New
Guinea, January 30th, and next day the "Basilisk", laden with
provisions, and carrying fifty tons of coal on deck, was all
ready for sailing. It was a wild day, blowing half a gale, but
numbers of people came down to the rocky point of Farm Cove, off
which we were anchored, to see us off; others came in boats, and
the ship was crowded with friends, from whom we all felt it more
or less painful to part. As soon as the anchor was at our bow,
our men sprang aloft with flags, and running out on the
yard-arms, and up to the mast-heads, waved them for farewell;
this was answered with cheer on cheer from the shore, which the
"Basilisk's" crew heartily returned, and then we steamed on our
way&mdash;our homeward-bound pennant streaming eighty yards
astern.</p>
<p>We were much delayed by contrary winds during our first week
at sea, accompanied by such strong southerly currents that we
were obliged to put into Brisbane to replenish coal, lest we
should be crippled ere our surveying commenced. We shipped
another deck load, and encouraged by the hearty interest taken in
the work before us by Lord Normanby and his Government, finally
left the Australian shores on February 9th, and steered for Teste
Island. We occupied our time on the way by preparing for the
survey; deep-sea lines were marked up to 3000 fathoms, the steam
pinnace fitted with strong canvas upper works, and a hood over
the bows to increase her safety in a sea-way, and give comfort to
the men, and the other boats made ready for detached service.</p>
<p>On February 17th, when within 100 miles of Teste Island, we
met a strong north-west gale, accompanied by a heavy sea, in
which the deep-laden "Basilisk" did not make her usual good
weather. We were striking the top-gallant masts when she made a
sudden plunge, a great sea swept over the forecastle, and with it
went our gallant boatswain. The cry of "a man overboard!" roused
every one. A boat's crew sprang at once into the quarter-boat to
go to the rescue. For an instant I was agitated by as painful a
doubt as can assail a seaman, as to whether I could permit the
attempt to be made, the chances were so heavy against these nine
lives in the quarter-boat; but a look to windward decided me, for
Mr. Mudge was striking out bravely, and as he rose on the top of
a great wave, he shouted out cheerily&mdash;"I am all right,
sir!"&mdash;an unselfish speech, for he afterwards told me that
he had thought by my face that I was about to jump overboard to
save him, and wished to prevent it. I had no such thought, for I
could not have saved myself in such a sea, and my duty was to
look after the ship.</p>
<p>The boat was skilfully lowered away, and got clear safely, and
the issue for life or death was watched breathlessly from the
ship, for the boatswain was a favourite with all hands. A heavy
sea disabled the oars for a space, and hope sank low, for our
shipmate was exhausted, and lay floating deeply, and about to
sink. At last the cry arose&mdash;"They have him!" and thank God
it was true, though he had sunk below the surface ere rescued.
Almost as anxiously we watched for the return of the boat, which
came borne along on the crest of a great wave, and then appeared
to be sinking stern foremost into the yawning abyss; but all were
soon safe on board, and in a day or two we had the satisfaction
of seeing Mr. Mudge at his duty.</p>
<p>On the 20th we passed Bell Rock, and through a grey watery
mist made out the well-remembered peaks and outlines of our
former discoveries with a thrill of gratification, remembering
our work done, and feeling that we were returning to complete it
under honourable circumstances. That evening we rode at anchor in
our old haven, Hoop-iron Bay, surrounded by hundreds of natives,
who recognised us with shouts of welcome, and Lieutenant Dawson
and the new hands were enchanted with the exquisite scenery
surrounding.</p>
<p>Six weeks only lay at our disposal, and I had anxiously
considered how to make the most of them. We were ordered to
commence the survey where we had left off last year, and carry it
thence round East Cape, and along the unknown north coast of New
Guinea, till the expiration of our time should arrest us; but I
resolved to begin by making a trigonometrical survey of the space
between Teste Island and East Cape, so as to decide at the outset
the important question as to whether an available entrance to the
new route existed here or not.</p>
<p>We remained at Teste Island till February 24th, rating the
chronometers, and accurately fixing the position of O'Neill
Island as a starting-point for our survey, and during this time
our steam pinnace was an unceasing wonder to the natives. On one
occasion Lieutenant Smith took about fourteen of their canoes in
tow, and the owners shouted with pleasure and admiration, till he
blew the steam whistle, when their consternation was extreme.
They became convinced, however, that no ill was intended them,
and after landing, collected their women on the beach, and made
signs that they wished the whistle to be blown, which was done,
and the men were highly amused by the terror of the women, who
fled in dismay. Some time afterwards we had a native with us in
the steam pinnace a whole day, and Lieutenant Dawson took pains
in explaining the action of the engine to him, and found the man
so interested and intelligent as apparently to grasp the
principle by which it acted. Amongst our many necessary duties
was one of making surveying stations on various lofty points, and
except in the case of our first station under the lofty tree
before mentioned, on O'Neill Island, all the required points were
so thickly wooded that regular expeditions had to be made to
clear a horizon for the theodolite. The summit of Glenton, a
small island some three miles in circumference, and 400 feet
high, four miles south-east of Moresby Island, was first attacked
by a party, consisting of about forty men armed with axes and
saws. The island rises so precipitously from the sea that landing
is difficult, but we found a small sandy beach, and landing
without a wetting, we chose the shoulder of a steep hill which
seemed likely to lead to the top, and began to climb. It was easy
at first, for we could pass between the trees; soon, however, the
dense under-growth closed in, and every foot of way had to be cut
through creepers and bushes. So thick was the entanglement, that
we could only direct our progress to the top by sending men into
the lofty tree-tops to guide us. Streaming with perspiration, and
tormented with mosquitoes, we found ourselves at last on a narrow
plateau, about a quarter of an acre in extent, dipping on its
southern side to a precipice so wooded as to shut out every
glimpse of the sea, the sun itself was almost hidden from our
sight by the dense undergrowth in which we were buried, and the
over-shrouding leafage. It seemed a task for Hercules to clear
away such a mass of obstruction; but the strong arms of our men
soon let in daylight: axes rang and saws grated cheerfully, and
every now and then came the cry, "Stand clear!" and a big tree
bowed its head and toppled over, crushing down the underwood in
its fall, and thus doing good service. Below the plateau our men
found foothold on projecting ledges, and felled the huge trees
that grew up the face of the precipice. These, as they rolled
over, were often caught in their descent by other trees, and
remained provokingly obstructing the view, so that three trees
had often to be felled to lower one. In the midst of our work a
violent tropical storm burst over us, and was welcome indeed, for
the water we had brought up with us was all expended, and we were
all thirsty. As the rain ran in small water-spouts from the
branches, every mouth was open to catch it, and we thought the
refreshment cheaply purchased by a wetting.</p>
<p>In a few hours all the trees, except a giant which we left to
crown the summit, had fallen, and the theodolite was free to
sweep the horizon. We felt proud of our work, but gazed on it
with some ruth as we thought of the years it would take nature to
replace these leafy shades. Our thoughts were soon drawn away by
the glorious panorama that stretched before us. Below us, at the
foot of the precipice, the light waves curled on a snowy coral
beach; to the west the wooded peaks of Moresby Island closed the
view; but on every other side, island after island floated on the
calm of an intense blue sea, volcanic, lofty and rugged, or
coralline, low, white, and covered with graceful trees. Every
variety of form, and tint of light and shadow, abounded in the
near islands; whilst those beyond faded out, as they distanced,
into dim shapes, faint clouds, very dreams of islands, giving one
a sense of the profusion of creative power, that was almost
overwhelming.</p>
<p>The summit of Glenton Island being cleared, we left Lieutenant
Dawson to take his round of angles, and went to visit a group of
islands about nine miles off the east end of Moresby Island,
named by us Engineer Group, as a whole; and separately, Slade,
Skelton, Watts, and Butchard, after our able engineers. The three
first are lofty islands, from six to nine miles in circumference,
and highly cultivated by their inhabitants: Slade Island has very
large villages, Lieutenant Smith and I finding that there was too
much surf on for us to land from the steam pinnace on Slade
Island, went on shore in native canoes, knowing that in case of
treachery at the hands of these untried natives we could protect
ourselves with our revolvers, and received a somewhat doubtful
welcome from a large crowd on the beach. We gave them the
salutation learned by us on our last cruise, and on this the
people thawed a little, and led us to a cleared space in their
village, where we sat down, and they all seated themselves round
us, and commenced an animated conversation amongst themselves, of
which we were evidently the subjects. Tired of waiting their
pleasure, we rose presently, and began to walk about and
investigate. They seemed to think we were going to steal their
goods, and would not let us enter their houses, nor barter for
anything, save a few nuts and yams; so that we left them with our
bags of iron hoop pretty full. Going off in the canoe, I was
upset for the second time that day, and being weighed down by the
iron hoop, sank, and should have found a difficulty in getting to
the surface again, had it not fallen out of the bag and allowed
me to rise and gain the bottom of the canoe.</p>
<p>By March 3d, after unremitting hard work of officers and men,
Lieutenant Dawson and I had satisfied ourselves that the passage
round East Cape was not through China Straits, but round the east
end of Moresby Island; and on this day I had the satisfaction of
conning the ship from the foretop through the passage between
Grant and Shortland Islands, and so through still narrower waters
to an island near East Cape, seen by us last year, and named
Lydia, about ten miles in circumference, and 1034 feet high. This
was a great point gained, as it proved the existence of a channel
navigable for large steamers round the East Cape of New Guinea;
but as it led in one place between dangerous reefs, with a
channel scarce 500 yards wide, I resolved to devote more time,
and search for a safe channel for sailing-vessels. In the
meantime the lofty razor-edge summit of Lydia Island was cleared
for a station, and from this look-out we could discern more than
fifty islands awaiting our survey and naming. I was struck by the
conscientiousness displayed by a boy at Lydia Island, with whom I
attempted to barter an axe for a handsome shell necklace he wore.
He made signs that the necklace was not his, and refused to
trade; his companions urged him vehemently, even trying to force
it off his neck, and at last so far prevailed that he took the
axe from my hand and half unfastened the necklace; conscience
pricked him, and he hurriedly thrust back the axe, and making
signs that he would go and get leave from the owner to sell it,
paddled off amidst the jeers of his friends. The houses on Lydia
Island were unusually small, and the natives seemed of a darker
race than those in the vicinity.</p>
<p>On March 4th we paid our first and much desired visit to the
D'Entrecasteaux group. These lofty islands, which culminate in
7000 feet of height, had been seen from a distance on their
eastern side by the French navigator whose name they bear, but
had not been visited by him or any white man. We had spent this
day in surveying off the southern shores of the Prevost range, as
we have named the lofty southern range of the islands, and
observing a populous village at Cape Ventenat, resolved to land
there. The people in the canoes near shore feared and avoided us,
so we gave chase to some canoes which we saw to seaward, and
coming up with them before they could reach the reef they were
making for, threw them some strips of red cloth and lengths of
iron hoop, and conciliated them; but we landed with caution, for
all the women had been sent out of sight, and the men looked
doubtful of us. Our precautions were happily needless; we were
eagerly welcomed; the women and children soon reappeared, and we
were offered hot and savoury food from their large earthen bowls.
Here, for the first time, human figures painted on the gable-ends
of the larger houses were seen by us; the artist's skill was of
the rudest, and the subjects were unfit for reproduction. We did
not meet with any other attempt to delineate the human form here,
save in some small grotesque carvings at the ends of wooden
knives, spoons, and ornamented clubs, of which many were pretty
well executed.</p>
<p>On March 8th, so much surveying work had been accomplished
that it became needful for Lieutenant Dawson to leave off active
work, and plot or place the accumulated results on the chart, and
as this would occupy our able surveyor a week, I determined to
spend this time in making a running survey of the D'Entrecasteaux
group. We took the "Basilisk" accordingly that evening round to
the northern coast of New Guinea, and after much searching, the
shore being "steep to", and the water very deep, found ground in
twenty-two fathoms, with swinging room for the ship in a bay.
Dropping anchor about five yards from the sounding, it sank into
forty-five fathoms, whilst under our stern the depth was
ninety-three fathoms. Next day we steered for the western shores
of D'Entrecasteaux, passing several dangerous reefs, and anchored
twenty-five miles north of East Cape, in a small cove, where the
ship had barely room to swing clear of the reefs. Trap Bay, as we
named it, is exposed to westerly winds, but the weather was fine,
and it answered our requirements. The ship safe, I went away
exploring the coast to the north, and found what I thought to be
an extensive bay, but which proved afterwards to be broad straits
separating the two southern islands of the D'Entrecasteaux group.
It was dark when we returned to the ship, and a heavy swell was
rolling in, precursor of bad weather, which kept us bound to our
dangerous anchorage for two days. Only a few natives lived about
Trap Bay, and their houses were so well hidden in the bush that
we could not find them. They would not communicate with us on
shore, but came freely off to the ship, with pigs and fruit. On
the 10th we stood north, to look for an anchorage, and found
ourselves in a wide strait, separating the two large southern
islands which we have since named Normanby and Fergusson Islands.
We kept along its southern shores, beneath the lofty volcanic
peaks of Normanby Island, not knowing what any moment might
reveal to us, and, being under its lee, were sailing in calm blue
water. Before us rose a pyramidal mountain, about 4000 feet high,
rounding which we could see the sea beyond, but almost shut out
from view by a cluster of islets at this, the eastern entrance to
the Straits. Our boats went now to search for anchorage, and soon
we dropped anchor, and swung clear by a few yards of a dark sandy
beach, through which a clear mountain stream cut its way to the
sea.</p>
<p>The beach was fringed with jungle and forest trees, but
casting our eyes up the precipitous mountain-side we saw abundant
cultivation, and beyond us a cleared space where a number of
women were standing gazing at us, but no village. Presently the
men came crowding to the beach, armed with clubs and spears, and
Mr. Bentley and I landed, and walking up to the astonished
savages gave them some presents, and patted them on the back; in
fact, by this time we had all attained such experience in the
management of savages that we felt confident of succeeding with
these, and they soon Became friendly, and we presently returned
to the ship, carrying our purchases of weapons, which had perhaps
been brought to the beach to be used against us. From this time,
during the week we spent here, the ship was besieged from dawn to
sunset by hundreds of canoes, containing many hundreds of natives
from far and near, eager to barter all they possessed for iron
hoop&mdash;stone hatchets, ornaments, yams, fruit, and fish,
which latter made an agreeable variety of food for the men.</p>
<p>These natives are similar to the New Guinea men, but seem more
liable to loathsome skin diseases. Their weapons differ slightly,
the spears here being made without barbs, and they use slings for
stones made of hair or fibre.</p>
<p>Our seamen made themselves popular with their dusky friends by
getting them on board and painting them with quaint devices in
tar and red paint; and those thus ornamented became objects of an
envy on shore that produced only too many candidates for the
paint-brush. Our men gave these people an alarm unintentionally
on one occasion, by running up suddenly to loose sails. In a
moment their canoes began to fly, crushing against each other,
the large overwhelming the small, till, when about 100 yards off,
they turned, and seeing that no harm was intended, regained their
confidence, and seemed immoderately amused at their fears. After
a time we began to observe that none of the natives who wore cane
bracelets on their arms would allow themselves to be painted, and
by their signs we understood that they were in mourning for the
dead. Some of the officers visited the village belonging to these
people, which stood about 1500 feet above the sea, on the brow of
a hill, and was surrounded by cultivation, but they were not
received with cordiality. The women were kept out of sight, and
the men were evidently relieved when their visitors took their
departure. The young officers became, whilst here, the possessors
of native canoes, in which, in spite of many capsizes, they used
to cruise about, miles away from the ship. Wild duck were seen
here, perched on the branches of lofty trees, and spiders were
found with bodies 5&frac12; inches in length.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Dawson now began to plot his work, Lieutenant Smith
to wood and water the ship, and Navigating-Lieutenant Mourilyan,
Mr. Watts, engineer, and I, started in the steam-pinnance to lay
down the unknown coast-line of these D'Entrecasteaux Islands,
having six men with us. We had a whale-boat in tow which carried
coals and provisions for a week, and would be a means of escape
in case of accident to the pinnace.</p>
<p>Steaming out of the new strait to which we had given the name
of Dawson Strait, to the west, we passed close under the high
mountains that form its northern boundary, the native villages
built high up on the hills, with their patches of cultivated
ground, contrasting well with the mass of sombre forest which,
except where broken by ravines, overspread all. Our course lay
for a projecting cape off Fergusson, the middle island of the
group, about twenty miles distant, and as we passed on within a
few yards of the shore, the excited natives who watched us, and
who must have thought us gods moving rapidly on the water without
the exertion of apparent power, raced along the beach after us,
shouting their exclamation of surprise, "Hoo-ee, Hoo-ee!" We had
not time to land, but pressing on found ourselves at the entrance
of another broad noble strait, which proved to separate Fergusson
from the northmost and loftiest island of the D'Entrecasteaux
group, to which we have given the name of Goodenough.
This&mdash;Moresby Strait&mdash;is from eight to ten miles wide
and fifteen in length, and both its island shores are grandly
picturesque, Mount Goodenough rising to a height of nearly 8000
feet. The sides of this great mountain are cultivated to a height
of about 2000 feet; gradually its woods give place to barrenness,
and its summits stand bare and knife-edged against the sky.
Mountain torrents dash down its ravines, and flash out at times
from their dark green setting like molten silver. Night now
closing, we sought to anchor between a small islet and the shore;
our draught of water was but twelve or fourteen inches, and yet
we could obtain no anchorage, for the channel was full of
mushroom coral, which rose like great pillars from a depth of
twenty and thirty fathoms to within three or four inches of the
surface, so close together, that after many a wearying trial off
the entrance of lovely coves and delicious looking bays, we had
to seek a precarious anchorage in twenty fathoms water, outside
these coral pillars, on which a dangerous surf was breaking. The
natives then crowded alongside us, but we were weary, and wanted
to have our evening meal in peace, so blew the steam whistle, and
they seized their paddles and glided off into the darkness; but
all night long the village clamoured like a frightened rookery,
and our look-out men were frequently startled by natives stealing
out to within a few feet of us on the reef. At last, some sleep
being needful, I caused a rifle to be fired to seaward, and this
secured us some quiet. Next day we attempted to pass round the
north-west side of Goodenough Island. Its south-western shores
are low, and rise very gradually for a mile, till they meet the
first swellings of Mount Goodenough. Villages are scattered all
over this ample plain, and the dark sandy beach is cut through by
many mountain streams. We failed to circumnavigate the island for
want of fuel, and the labour of constantly filling the boiler
with fresh water was very retarding. Our first stopping place was
at a little creek, named by us Breakfast Cove, at the head of
which was a brackish lagoon, and beyond that, in thick forest, a
rock-strewn watercourse, with delicious pools of cool water, in
which we bathed, to our great refreshment. Here we breakfasted,
and enjoyed the shade and space, after our much cramping up, in
the boat. A naturalist would have envied our position, surrounded
as we were by strange trees and shrubs and beautiful birds, to
which we unfortunately could give no name. We knew the Megapode,
a bush turkey, and recognised it here a bird like a small
barndoor fowl, with long yellow legs. The nests each consisted of
about thirty cartloads of dry leaves, sticks, and shells, formed
into a great heap, the heat of which would hatch the eggs
deposited. Leaving Breakfast Cove we continued our course along
the south-west of the island for about fifteen miles, coasting
along a fine belt of alluvial land, full of villages, and well
cultivated, the cultivation running from the plain high up the
precipitous sides of magnificent Mount Goodenough, which are
broken into an endless variety of ravines and valleys
overshadowed by the lofty peaks that pierce the clear blue air.
As day closed in I found that the island extended too far to the
north-west, and that our coal was too short for us to get round
it, and we turned back, much regretting the necessity, and
anchored for the night in Breakfast Cove, where we had some work
as usual in filling the boiler before turning in. We were
awakened in the morning by the discordant screams of many birds,
and after a plunge into one of the clear pools, shaded over by
great trees, we steered for Fergusson Island, and came opposite a
large village at noon. Here a very pleasant-looking old lady
paddled off to us in a catamaran; we gave her some strips of red
cloth, and she became quite friendly. On our landing, strange to
say the women were the first to come forward, the men appearing,
but keeping back in a state of evident timidity. The presents we
gave the women, however, soon brought the men round us, and so
entire was my confidence in their peaceable disposition that I
visited their inland plantations, accompanied only by a seaman. I
found large enclosures, well fenced in with bamboo, producing
tropical fruits, yams, sweet potatoes, Indian corn, and
sugar-cane, and saw the sago-palm growing in rich abundance here.
The natives mash the sago in immense troughs, which I at first
thought to be worn-out canoes. We all enjoyed this food, and used
it largely. The good feeling of these natives deserves mention.
They had never seen the "Basilisk", and knew nothing of our
possessing superior arms. We were but ten men amongst hundreds,
and they knew that we carried iron hoop on our persons; but not
only did they refrain from the least attempt to molest us, but
they helped us over obstacles, showed us the best paths, and took
care of our clothes whilst we bathed. Here, a mile from the
beach, I saw large masses of coral rock cropping up at perhaps a
hundred feet above the sea level, close to volcanic cliffs.
Taking leave of our friends, we passed to the north between
Fergusson and Goodenough Islands, and found ourselves on the
north shore of Fergusson Island. Steering then to the east, we
hoped to go down round this island to the "Basilisk" in Dawson
Strait. There was a singular absence of coral formation on this
north shore; and the beach and bottom of the sea, formed of black
volcanic sand, offered many valuable anchorages, as they sloped
gradually into deep water. No natives lived on this part of the
island, and we could not find any fish in the bays. We anchored
for the night in a snug bay on the north side of the island; and
on landing shot a wallaby.</p>

<br>
<small>SHOOTING A WALLIBY, NEAR THE BOILING SPRINGS, ON THE
D'ENTRECASTEAUX ISLANDS</small></p>
<br>
<p>We discovered here some boiling mineral springs, strongly
alkaline, which united themselves in a rivulet that offered any
degree of temperature to our bathers. Other hot springs may exist
here at the bottom of the sea, which would account for the
absence of fish in the bays. In the sand and mud thrown out by
these springs we found very small specimens of rubies and
amethysts, evidently chippings from larger stones. We enjoyed our
bathing here under the shade of huge overhanging trees, with the
comfortable faith that snakes and alligators were unlikely to
tolerate such a temperature, and that we should have our bath to
ourselves, and the steam kept the mosquitoes at a distance, so
that our comfort was perfect. On getting outside, on the 15th, we
were met by a strong south-east breeze, and had to take shelter
in a large bay, named by us Hughes Bay, after our stoker,
sheltered to the north by eight or ten lofty islets, which we
named Amphlett Group. After filling our boiler with fresh water,
and trading with the friendly natives, who regarded our colour
and clothes with wonder, we made a second attempt to round the
east end of the island; but the wind had now increased to a gale,
accompanied by a heavy ocean sea, which placed us in considerable
danger, and finding from the unexpected trend of the land that we
were still thirty or forty miles from the ship, we bore up, and
determined to make a fair wind of the gale by returning the way
we came. We spent the night in a sheltering bay, abounding with
turtle, on the north-east of the island; and next morning rose
early, and our coal being now expended, cut wood, by the aid of
which, and greased coal bags, we managed to make about twenty
miles progress, and reach the village we had previously visited
in Moresby Straits, where we anchored for the night.</p>
<p>On March 18th we made another attempt to reach the ship, and
when just at the entrance of Dawson Straits we had the pleasure
of seeing her come steaming towards us, Lieutenant Smith,
according to orders, being on his way to look for us on account
of our prolonged absence. The cleanliness, free space, and
comfort of the ship was very welcome after our hardships, and we
were able to feel with pleasure that we had done a good piece of
work in laying down the principal part of the before unknown
coast-line of these islands, which lie directly in the track of
the new route, extending ninety miles in a N.W. and S.E.
direction, with an average width of about fifteen miles.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Dawson had finished his plotting by our return, so
we sailed at once for our old surveying-ground, resolving to
strain every nerve in searching for a better passage from the
south round the East Cape of New Guinea. I had found by
experience that boats were too low in the water to be of much use
in such work, and were only fit to verify the clearness of a
channel for a few yards at either side. I have frequently passed
within twenty yards of dangerous reefs in boats without observing
them, whereas, from aloft in the ship, in fine weather, and in
the absence of too strong a sun-glare on the water, a reef could
be seen two or three miles off. Our plan was for the ship to
start in the early morning and take a zig-zag course to avoid the
level sun-rays, sounding as she went, whilst we despatched boats
at intervals to carry out lines of soundings between two fixed
points, and to fix the position of any dangers that might exist.
During such work Lieutenant Dawson would be absent for a day or
two, engaged in the more scientific work of fixing positions
trigonometrically. We almost lived aloft those days; but the
weather was generally fine, and our work went on well. The
anxious moments came when a cloud no bigger than a man's hand
appeared on the horizon, and growing and nearing us rapidly,
enveloped us in a tropical tornado, which sometimes lasted two
hours. Anxious hours they were indeed, as we drove across the
rain-pitted sea, now over the safe blue of the deep water, now
over the treacherous shoaling green of the reefs; the leadsmen,
like messengers of fate in the chains, calling their soundings;
shut in all round by a gloom which no eye could pierce; seeing
nothing but the coral below, which seemed to lift itself up to
meet us; forbearing to anchor till there was no other
alternative, and drifting on we knew not whither. It was
difficult as the man at the bowsprit end reported "water appears
to be shoaling!" to answer with a sufficiently cheery "very
well!" The men cowered in their light clothing from the pitiless
rain, which was cold and sharp as hail; our ears were full of the
confusion of the elements and the roar of the escaping
steam&mdash;all in strange contrast with the sunny calm which had
just preceded.</p>
<p>At other times, when wooding or making plans, we anchored the
ship and were away in the boats for days, Lieutenants Sydney
Smith and Deedes, Navigating-Lieutenant Mourilyan, Mr. Mudge, and
I, working in different directions; and on all occasions the tact
of the officers and good behaviour of the men prevented trouble
arising with the natives. Once Lieutenant Smith thought that the
cupidity of the natives of Teste Island was excited by the sight
of the fire-bars of the steam pinnace, and he prudently changed
his position. Lieutenant Deeds was fortunate in witnessing a
fight between the natives of Slade and those of East Cape and
Moresby Island. The combined warriors approached Slade Island in
about twenty canoes, containing some thirty men each, but
remained thirty yards off shore, throwing spears and slinging
stones at the Slade Islanders, who waded out and returned the
discharge. They kept this safe distance for two hours, dodging
each other's missiles so skilfully that nobody seemed seriously
hurt. We rarely saw a wounded man amongst these people, and but
few enemies' skulls adorned the outside of their houses.</p>
<p>On March 26th we were joined by H.M.S. "Sandfly", but, as she
had unfortunately grounded on a reef and injured her rudder, her
services were lost to us, and she returned to Possession Bay for
repairs.</p>
<p>On April 1st it was necessary to cut a supply of wood, and we
found an anchorage off Blackney Island, a low uninhabited coral
islet, about fifteen miles to the north-east of Moresby Island,
where there was an abundance of wood, and which seemed to be an
ancient home of the megapodes, as they had nested here in great
numbers. The poor birds were delicious food, and were sacrificed
accordingly. When we had got our wood off, the "Basilisk" looked
more like an Irish turf-boat than a man-of-war, her entire
upper-deck being covered with great wood-stacks; but we were only
too happy to see it there, fuel being everything towards the
success of our work.</p>
<p>Our surveying, which was monotonous work enough, was sometimes
diversified by little incidents; for instance, in surveying Fools
Cap, an isolated rock, Lieutenant Smith espied a cave with some
rare shells shining within, and working his way in to get at
them, had just put his hand on one, when a large land-snake
upreared itself and disputed possession; taken by surprise, he
tumbled back with more haste than dignity, and summoned some of
the boat's crew, when he returned to the attack and killed the
snake, a dangerous-looking brute, about four feet long, with
claws or teeth in its tail.</p>
<p>On April 8th we resumed our old position at Possession Bay to
await the arrival of a vessel with coal and stores expected by
us. The result of our work was that we had found a passage, the
least width of which was two miles, leading from Teste Island to
the north of New Guinea; but there was still much to be done, and
our boats were kept detached on work which, when all summed up,
resulted in the laying down of more than 2000 miles of fixed
soundings in this survey off the East Cape and D'Entrecasteaux
Islands.</p>
<p>The "Sandfly" was lying here on our arrival, and we found that
the natives had committed the bold act of stealing the barricoes
and boat's crutches from one of her boats. I had always been
ready to overlook the smaller delinquencies of the natives, but
this was going a step too far, and I directed Lieutenant Nowell,
her commander, to lay an ambush, and seize some natives, near the
spot where the robbery had been committed. Two were accordingly
secured after a long struggle, in which their smooth skin and
supple limbs eluded the attempts of our strong seamen, and were
taken on board the "Sandfly", where they seemed to expect instant
death. Their wives and friends came off weeping and offering
presents to buy them off, and the natives deserted the ship and
kept close to the shore in their canoes, ready for instant flight
into the bush. I went amongst them in a dingey, thinking that
many of them would recognise me and be assured, and at last
succeeded in making them understand that the prisoners should be
set free when the property was brought back. On the second day
they restored the articles and we released the men, to the
intense joy of their friends, which it was quite affecting to
witness, and presently a large hog was sent on board the
"Sandfly" to show their gratitude. A few days afterwards our
carpenters, working on a stage over the side, missed a saw, but
before we could take any steps, we saw a large canoe coming off,
in which an old man stood holding up the saw, and on reaching us
he returned it and expressed his anger at the theft.</p>
<p>The coal barque arriving, we were gladdened by the receipt of
news from home, five months old it is true, but still how
welcome! On April 15th, having got our coal on board, and having
found that the "Sandfly's" defects unfortunately rendered it
necessary to send her to Sydney, we towed the two vessels out of
Possession Bay, gave them a good offing, and after seeing them
stand south for Sydney, anchored in Hoop-Iron Bay to rate our
chronometers. The following ten days were devoted to perfecting
our knowledge of the route we had discovered, which passed
between the east end of Moresby Island and Engineer Group, with a
depth of water varying from 30 to 500 fathoms. A still more roomy
but longer route had also been found by us from Teste Island to
the north side of New Guinea, running eastward of the whole
Archipelago Islands lying off East Cape.</p>
<p>We felt that all our desires of last year in this respect had
now been fulfilled, and that the "Basilisk" had opened a new and
accurately surveyed highway for commerce between Australia, New
Guinea, and China.</p>

<p><small>I WISHED</small> to remain longer and carry our survey
farther to the eastward; but I had already exceeded the time
allowed me by a fortnight; and there remained a running survey of
the unknown north-east coast for about 300 miles as the crow
Hies, to be accomplished, a length which was certain to be much
extended by the irregularities of the coast-line. We therefore
turned the "Basilisk's" head westward on April 27th, amidst great
rejoicings, for every mile was now a mile nearer home. At this
time we were attacked by a low fever of a mild type, which
completely prostrated those it seized for the time, and rendered
our subsequent work more arduous, the more so as we were already
forty men short of complement.</p>
<p>The first striking differences between these northern and the
southern shores of New Guinea are, that here there is no outlying
Barrier Reef, and that the shores, instead of shelving outwards,
are steep-to. The mountains here generally run down to the sea;
then follows a shore reef, from which the plumb line may be
thrown into fifty fathom water. The coastline is, as a rule, but
little broken up, and affords few harbours, but offers several
anchorages. Speaking generally, the coast-line from East Cape to
Cape Cretin, a distance of 300 miles, may be spoken of as a
series of bold headlands, running out twenty to forty miles
seaward, with deep bays between&mdash;a configuration which
increased our work twofold.</p>
<p>It has already been said that the passage between East Cape
and the D'Entrecasteaux islands was named by us "Goschen
Straits". Passing East Cape to the westward, the islands and the
mainland of New Guinea recede from each other, forming an
extensive bay, which we named after our commodore, "Goodenough".
At the western end of this bay New Guinea stretches out, a far
projecting promontory, to within fifteen miles of Goodenough
Island; the passage between we named after the first Lord of the
Admiralty, "Ward-Hunt Straits"; and named the promontory Cape
Vogel, after the Prime Minister of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Between East Cape and Cape Vogel there is a coast-line of
about 100 miles, along with a depth of from 500 to 600 fathoms;
and a muddy bottom prevails at about two miles from the shore.
Villages abound here, and the valleys, not seen from the sea, on
account of the lie of the hills, are well cultivated.</p>
<p>Our course now lay round the southern shores of Goodenough
Bay; and twenty miles west of East Cape the "Basilisk" found a
good anchorage in Bentley Bay, and remained there for a day to
survey and explore the surrounding country. The natives had
evidently heard of us from their fellow-countrymen to the
eastward, for they received us joyfully, and brought us off
numbers of pigs, one of which was large enough to give all the
ship's company a dinner. Landing with a small party I climbed the
precipitous hills, 2000 feet high, and looked across to Milne
Bay, which lay at their southern base. The land between was
fairly cultivated, and watered by many streams; and to the west
we could see great mountains rising in the clear air perhaps a
hundred miles distant.</p>
<p>After a long tiresome scramble through the thick forest, where
we were indebted to the natives who met us for guidance, we got
back to the village off which the ship was anchored, suffering a
good deal from the severe stings of the tree ants that had
attacked us in the trees we were compelled to climb in order to
take observations.</p>
<p>That night on board was marked by a mutiny amongst our
numerous pigs; they were securely penned amidships, and remained
quiet enough till the middle watch, when they suddenly seemed to
become as possessed as their Jewish brethren of old, leapt out of
the pens, and rushed squealing and grunting to the gangways to
jump overboard. The men, who were all sleeping on deck, were
quickly on the alert to save their future dinners. The pigs
rushed wildly between their legs, capsizing them in all
directions at first, but numbers prevailed in the end, and the
poor piggies were secured all but one, which had successfully
charged the guardians of the gangways and plunged overboard.</p>
<p>On April 29th we left Bentley Bay and went westward. From this
point commenced our running survey, during which the positions of
every prominent point on the coast, at distances of from twenty
to forty miles from each other, was exactly fixed, the coast-line
between carefully sketched in, and soundings laid down. I also
kept steadily to my custom of communicating with the natives
whenever possible.</p>
<p>Beyond Cape Ducie and Chads Bay the forest ceases, and is
succeeded by an openly-wooded plateau, full of villages, which is
backed two miles inwards by a range of sharp grassy hills, bare
of wood, each defined by a belt of dark brushwood at its base,
and coming crowding down, hill upon hill, with such a curious
effect, as to remind us strongly of the plate in Black's "Atlas"
of all the mountains of the world. Above the height of 2000 feet
the forest, singularly enough, springs up again, on higher peaks,
and covers them to the very top, at a height of six or seven
thousand feet. Cape Frere is a noble headland, dropping, in a
huge buffalo-headed mass, almost perpendicularly to the deep blue
sea; and the "Basilisk" looked like a mere cock-boat in its
shadow, as, almost scraping her sides against the beetling mass,
she stood in to seek for an anchorage in Bartle Bay. This bay has
an extensive tract of comparatively low land, marked by terraced
plateaus at its head, from which a stream debouches through a
dark sandy beach, and this seemed to afford a certainty of a good
anchorage being found for the night; but we were doomed to
disappointment, nowhere within a cable's length of the beach
would an eighty fathom line touch ground. At last, after much
seeking, we anchored in forty-nine fathoms&mdash;a depth greater
than that of the English Channel midway&mdash;with our stern just
swinging clear of the beach. The soil about Bartle Bay is very
rich; and the land runs back in a series of terraced elevations
to a lofty inland range of mountains. The river which issues at
the head of the bay has ploughed deeply through these terraces,
so that its banks are exposed in sections from ten to thirty feet
high; they are composed of smooth water-worn stones, embedded in
a light gravelly soil. We searched, but could find no trace of
gold here; nor was any seen by us on the north coast of New
Guinea. Wild duck abounded.</p>
<p>About 120 unarmed natives streamed along the beach to meet us
on our landing, the foremost carrying the sacrificial dog, and
others a pig slung on bamboo poles; but they were very timid, and
it was some time before we could succeed in inducing them to
approach us. When they gained confidence they took the dog by the
hind legs in the usual way, and dashed its brains out against the
gunwale of our boat, and hailing a passing canoe, they sent the
body on board the "Basilisk", where, by my orders, it was
received with all respect. They then presented me with the pig,
and I made a return present of a hatchet, which was received in a
way that showed they had but little idea of its use.</p>
<p>Next day we fixed the position of Cape Bartle, and explored
the country, but only to a small extent, as the tall coarse grass
was a serious hindrance. We followed the trend of the river,
taking advantage of occasional native tracks, which led to yam
and sugar-cane plantations, and visited the villages, which stand
in groves of trees, and are not visible from the beach. We were
surprised to find that the houses here were not built on poles
nor saddle-roofed, but thatched close down to the ground, and of
an oval form. The canoes were somewhat differently constructed,
and the language was wholly different. It seemed to us then that
Cape Frere was the dividing point between the two languages and
styles of house-building, but farther to the westward we observed
that the Malay building on poles recurred.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 1st we lifted our anchor with some
difficulty, so reduced was the effective ship's company, and
sailed for the bight of Goodenough Bay, some thirty miles off,
over a tranquil sea, for the monsoon blowing on the south side of
New Guinea was arrested by the lofty Owen Stanley range, the
summits of which were now always obscured with heavy clouds, that
told of troubled waters at the south side of the peninsula.</p>
<p>Our track lay about two miles from shore, and our faithful
little ally, the steam pinnace, kept abreast of us within
half-a-mile of the beach&mdash;a plan followed through this whole
remaining survey, as enabling us to lay down a double line of
soundings simultaneously.</p>
<p>The villages are scattered along this part of the coast on a
plateau of park-like land, which intervenes between the shore and
the mountains within, which, rising by gradually higher
undulations, terminate at a height of many thousand feet above
the sea. There can be no doubt as to the capabilities of this
land if cultivated. On the hills herds of cattle, and sheep
innumerable, might find pasture, whilst from the cold summits to
the hot plains all the products of wide extents of climate might
be grown. At two miles from shore we found the depth of water to
be 620 fathoms. The coast trends W.N.W. from Cape Frere for some
thirty miles to the bight of Goodenough Bay, which is marked by
some fine waterfalls, which flash down its dark green mountain
sides. So much river water is here discharged that the surface of
the bay near the shore is quite fresh. A mud flat offered us a
good anchorage here; and on some small islets off the coast, we
obtained an abundant supply of pigeons. The natives made every
effort to be friendly, but, as it was nearly dark when we
anchored, we did not see much of them; they are of a dark
copper-colour, and look intelligent.</p>
<p>The bold promontory, named by us Cape Vogel, which terminates
Goodenough Bay to the north-west, and is separated from the
D'Entrecasteaux Islands by Ward-Hunt Straits, being passed, we
found anchorage on the night of May 2d amidst a small group of
islets, ten miles west of it. These were named by us Jabbering
Islets, because their natives surrounded the ship with their
canoes at night, and kept up such a noise that we could get no
rest, though we tried every persuasion to induce them to move
off. At last, sleep being absolutely necessary, we fired a rifle
over their heads, and they vanished away into the gloom.</p>
<p>From Cape Vogel the land trends again W.N.W. for nearly fifty
miles, and shows the usual aspects of the low wooded plain, with
great mountains running behind, when another lofty promontory
runs out for forty miles to the north-east, and forms the
southern enclosure of another great bay. A double peaked mountain
rises 4000 feet high from this promontory, and shows to its full
height above the plain of the sea, and the low land from which it
springs. Altogether the features were so striking that I resolved
to honour them with great names. The Cape is therefore Cape
Nelson; the two summits of the mountain are Mounts Victory and
Trafalgar, and the great bay thus formed, is now Collingwood Bay.
At the head of Collingwood Bay we found a good anchorage, and
remained two days cutting wood. Here Lieutenant Smith observed
the droppings of some large grass-eating animal in a spot where
the bushes had been heavily trampled and broken. Our opinion was
decided that a rhinosceros had haunted there; and we were much
surprised, as this animal has-never been believed to exist in New
Guinea. It would have been very satisfactory to have set the
question thus started at rest, but time failed us. The natives
here, a dark, dirty-looking people, wholly destitute of clothing,
were very shy and difficult of approach, and threatened us with
their spears; but by dint of laying presents on the ground, and
making friendly gestures, we succeeded in winning them to trade a
little. All along this coast we noticed that the inhabitants of
the large and populous villages were more civilised and
comfortable-looking than those of the small, doubtless because
the most desirable sites had been chosen by the many, and they
had prospered accordingly. These Collingwood Bay people gazed at
us with such a blank astonishment, and held such consultation
about us amongst themselves, that we were persuaded that they, in
common with their neighbours on this coast, had never seen white
men before. The steam pinnace, whilst surveying at the head of
the bay, was chased by a large number of canoes holding thirty or
forty men each; but the officer in command did not think it
prudent to allow them to come at all near, and may therefore have
been mistaken in supposing their intentions to be hostile.</p>
<p>We left Collingwood Bay on April 5th, having found its western
waters studded with dangerous reefs, through which we had to pick
our way with great caution, and rounded Cape Nelson before
nightfall, when we were much impressed by the fine picturesque
appearance of Mounts Victory and Trafalgar. These mountains,
which are joined by a saddle-shaped ridge, descend to the sea in
open grassy and wooded slopes, which have all the appearance of
English parkland. Thence the land trended westward, a pretty
undulating country, with a shore broken up by bays and still
lagoons, protected by reefs. We anchored for the night about six
miles west of Cape Nelson, near some small islets, and were
disturbed by the natives singing and shouting round the ship; but
they kept at a distance. We made every effort in the morning to
get them to come alongside, but they would not. They were quite
unclad, repulsive-looking, and of a darkish colour, and wore
their hair in long ugly ringlets like pipe-stems. Their canoes
were of a kind new to us, being forty or fifty feet long, but so
exceedingly narrow that a man could barely squeeze into them;
besides the usual out-rigger, they had balancing spars on the
opposite side, supporting a fighting stage to hold five or six
men. In hope of making friends I coaxed some natives to bring
their canoes alongside my gig, and though they were much alarmed,
should have succeeded, but that my coxswain unfortunately stood
up and began to coil the lead-line, when they, thinking they were
about to be made fast, paddled off in an instant. Having failed
on the water, a party of us went on shore and visited the
village, but the natives had fled. The houses, which stood in
plantations, were built of light cane, with a fireplace in the
centre, and appeared clean; but every article had been removed
from them.</p>
<p>Returning to the ship we found that some canoes had ventured
near enough to barter; that no idea had been shown as to the
value of our axes and hoop-iron, but that strips of cloth had
been highly valued. Lieutenant Dawson, whilst engaged in fixing
the position of these islets had a spear thrown at him, hence we
called them Spear Islets. These natives had no human bone
ornaments like those of Milne Bay.</p>
<p>West of Cape Nelson lies another large bay, fringed by a low
densely-wooded coast, backed by the usual lofty inland range, and
in this bay, which I named Dyke Acland, after my revered friend
the late Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, Bart., we anchored in
thirty-three fathoms, at eight miles' distance from shore.</p>
<p>The morning of May 7th rose thick and gloomy, with heavy rain;
but having had a good view of the trend of the land the evening
before, we proceeded cautiously on, with the steam pinnace
leading. The western extremity of this bay, which is fifty miles
from Cape Nelson, is about twenty miles to the eastward of a
point indistinctly seen at a distance by D'Entrecasteaux and
named by him Cape Sud Est; but as this part of the coast is low,
and no distinctly defined cape exists here, it is evident that he
had mistaken the high inland range of mountains, on which the
position called by him a cape actually falls, for the
coast-line.</p>
<p>The weather now cleared, and we were able to send our steam
pinnace to coast along the shore as usual, whilst we kept on
abreast two miles outside. The trend of the land was now about
N.W., and the average depth of water about twenty-five fathoms.
The shore here is low and wooded, but the numerous villages we
passed seemed to indicate that it was not swampy land. Huge
wooded mountains were seen in the background, and were considered
by us to be part of the Owen Stanley range. Towards sunset we had
reached a point of land which projected about fifteen miles to
sea, crowned with hills about 400 feet high on the southern part,
in lat. 8&deg; 10' S., and long. 148&deg; 12 E., and named it
Caution Point, on account of the uncertain soundings we obtained.
We found an anchorage about half-a-mile from the shore, opposite
a considerable village, in which the wildest excitement began
immediately to prevail. Conches were blown, and a tumultuous
gathering of armed savages took place on the beach opposite the
ship. It happened to be one of our penny-reading nights, and they
evidently took the singing and loud chorus, borne to them across
the water, for our defiance, for they chanted back a war song in
return. All night this excitement continued amongst the natives,
but they did not venture off. In the morning, I took a boat with
five men, and made an attempt to be friendly; but, unfortunately,
such a surf was running on the beach as made it imprudent to
land, uncertain as we were of the dispositions of the natives,
whose excitement became intense as we neared the beach. About 100
men awaited us there, armed with spears, stone clubs, and
shields, ornamented with bird of paradise plumes on their
shoulders, and with shell necklets, and bedaubed with white and
red pigments on their bodies, which were quite naked. Many of
them were springing into the air and brandishing their weapons;
some waded out waist-deep shaking their spears at us, totally
unaware of our power to hurt them. Selecting one of these bold
fellows, we let the boat drift towards him, and stood with our
arms wide open to show that we had no weapons, one of the men
holding out a piece of red cloth on the end of a boat-hook as a
present. In this way we succeeded in getting four or five to come
close and take our presents, but they would give us nothing in
return. Suddenly they seized the boat and tried to drag us on
shore. Observing no friendly signs, however, and seeing that no
women or children were present, I decided on not landing. The
fellows holding the boat were very muscular, and we shook them
off with some difficulty, on which they caught the yoke-lines,
which we had to cut to get off, so resolved were they to detain
us. It was evident that as we went westward our dealings would
have to be held with a fiercer race of savages; but of this I had
been forewarned by the foresight of the then hydrographer,
Admiral Richards.</p>
<p>Leaving Caution Point, we kept a sharp look-out for a large
island shown on the chart as Richie Island, so named by
D'Entrecasteaux, after the naturalist of his expedition. The
position assigned it on the chart was long. 147&deg; 50' E., lat.
8&deg; 10' S., but rounding a cape less striking than the
preceding capes, we found that no such island existed, and that
the position given it was twenty miles inland. I therefore wished
to name the cape Ward-Hunt, but it still remains on the chart as
Richie Island, out of compliment to D'Entrecasteaux. Rounding
this cape the land trends again westward, and we saw before us a
large river discharging itself over a dangerous bar; immediately
to the west was a beautiful bay running up to a sandy beach,
fringed with groves of a kind of fir tree, admirably adapted for
firewood, of which we were now much in need. Choosing a position
off the best-looking trees, we anchored about 100 yards from the
beach, in thirteen fathoms water, and were rather glad that no
villages were at hand. In the evening some large canoes came
round a point and neared the ship, but refused to communicate.
They slowly paddled round, the savages chanting a monotonous
tune, and beating time with their paddles on the sides of their
canoes. Our men, then enjoying their singing and smoking hour,
replied by copying the chaunt, and the savages listened with a
dignified silence that provoked roars of laughter from the
"Basilisk". We found that they had no intention of retiring for
the night, so fired a signal-rocket over their heads, on which
they beat a hasty retreat.</p>
<p>The following morning the men were employed in wooding, and I
was writing in my cabin, when it was reported to me that three of
our officers had strayed away from the wooding party about a mile
along the beach, and that a large number of armed natives had
landed from canoes, and were stealing through the bush with the
evident intention of attacking them. We, from the ship, could see
the natives gliding through the underwood, but the imperilled
officers could not, and were quite unaware of their approach.
Sub-Lieutenant Shortland and I jumped into the dingey with some
spare rifles, and gained the beach just in time to give our
shipmates the rifles, and put them on their guard. Hoping to
maintain friendly relations, I advanced for about twenty yards
alone, armed with a rifle, but holding my arms over my head
towards the bush where the natives were now lurking, quite
concealed from view. Suddenly they sprang from the bush to the
open beach, and formed in two regular lines ten yards in my
front&mdash;the first line of men armed with spears, which they
held, quivering to throw, whilst they moved with a short quick
step from side to side, as if to distract an enemy's aim,
guarding themselves with shields. The second line was armed with
clubs. For some seconds I forbore to fire, hoping still to win
them round, but finding this hopeless, and that in another second
I should be a target for fifty spears, I fired with a snap-shot
at the leading savage. The bullet pierced his shield and spun him
round on his heel, but did not wound him; there was no need to
fire again and take life, for the whole body of warriors turned
instantly in consternation, and ran for the canoes, and we
followed till we drove them on board.<br></p>

<br>
<small>ATTACK OF NATIVES, TRAITORS' BAY</small></p>
<br>
<p>The river which lay beyond was named by us the Clyde.
Unfortunately the dangerous bar at its mouth prevented our
entering to explore it, and the jungle on its banks was too thick
to enable us to do so on foot. Its breadth was about sixty yards,
and the current clear and steady; and it will probably be found
by the explorer to lead into the interior, for the low and
undulating land it cleaves stretches back fully twenty miles to
the mountain ranges. The river banks abounded in pigeons. Having
got about forty tons of wood on board, we left the bay on May
10th. This bay, which will prove to be one of the best anchorages
on this coast, we named Traitors' Bay, on account of the attempt
made by the natives to cut off the officers.</p>
<p>As I write these lines a telegram has arrived announcing the
death of Commodore Goodenough, C.B., C.M.G., commanding on the
Australian station, by the poisoned arrows of the natives of
Santa Cruz Island. I desire to pay my humble tribute of sorrow
and admiration to the memory of this man, with whom I am happy in
having held a private friendship for twenty-five years. I do not
speak of the loss his friends sustain in him, of the generous
nature, full of large kindness and the power of sympathy, of the
sound helpful judgment that was ever ready for any call that
could be made on it, for this is sacred ground; I speak of him
only as a public man, and would say that though I have warmly
appreciated him all through, as he rose in our service, I never
knew his full professional worth till I had the honour of serving
under him in Australia. There, his grasp of mind in dealing with
a subject, his self-reliance and readiness to take
responsibility, his happy way of taking his captains into his
confidence, whilst always holding the reins himself, of giving
praise liberally where praise was due, and cordial support or
advice where either was needed, produced an impression on my mind
of greatness in store for him in the future, which can now never,
alas! be made good. His fine scientific and sailor-like
qualities, his promptitude, his iron nerve, combine with his
other gifts to make his loss a national one, and as such it will
doubtless be regarded, and this will be some consolation to his
friends; but their best will lie in the knowledge that his pure
and devout spirit was ever ready to enter the presence of its
Maker.</p>

<p><small>LEAVING</small> Traitors'. Bay, May 10th, we stood
west, Navigating-Lieutenant Mourilyan in the steam pinnace doing
good service as usual by examining the coast in-shore. Passing
the mouths of several small rivers, where alligators were seen
basking, we coasted the thickly-wooded level shore for twenty
miles, and opened a bay, where we anchored in five fathom water,
at two miles from shore, near a group of islets. The former we
named Hercules Bay, after Sir Hercules Robinson, S.C.M.G., and
the latter after the captain of Sheerness dockyard, Luard Islets.
Picking our way through this group in the morning, we found that
the coast-line on the west side of Hercules Bay altered its
character entirely, the low alluvial land giving place to
volcanic hills, that came precipitously down to the water's edge.
Numerous volcanic islands were scattered off the coast, and had a
singular appearance, looking as though great morsels had been
broken from the hills and thrown into the sea. Between them and
the mainland a depth of fifty fathoms prevailed. We saw no sign
of inhabitants here. Twenty miles farther to the north-west we
reached the Longuerue Island of D'Entrecasteaux, at the southern
entrance to Huon Gulf, from which point the coast-line has been
more or less accurately traced by the old navigators. Our work
now was virtually done, my great desire had been attained, and
England had won the honour of exploring out the last extensive
unknown coast-line in the habitable world, and completing the
work begun by Dampier about 1699, and continued by
D'Entrecasteaux a century later.</p>
<p>Our object now was to find a good place for firewood, and lay
in such a stock as would supply us with fuel till we should reach
Amboyna; so keeping close to the shore inside Longuerue Island,
till we opened a bay where we saw a fine clump of tall mangrove
trees, free from jungle, and growing on a point of land easy of
access, we anchored in twenty-five fathoms, off the edge of a
shore reef, in a well-sheltered position. Here we remained three
days, engaged in our last wood-cutting service. The men divided
as usual into axe-men, sawyers, and carriers; attacked the timber
with their old spirit, trees fell in all directions, and our
carriers, the marines, were kept briskly going, taking the wood
on bearers to be measured into fathoms, and down to the boats,
which lay moored off the white beach. The labour of wood-cutting,
in itself arduous, was so exhausting under a tropical sun that
everything was done on such occasions to excite a healthy
emulation amongst the men; they were divided into parties
according to the part of the ship to which they belonged, and
always worked together, aided frequently by most of the officers,
and myself, who felled and sawed with the rest. Many of the men
received ugly wounds in our first wood-cutting expeditions,
before becoming accustomed to the use of the tools, but our
greatest annoyance all through was from the ants, with which the
New Guinea trees swarmed. They are of various kinds and habits,
some are yellow, and burrow tunnels through the branches; a green
species glues large bunches of leaves and twigs together, and
forms a nest as large as a bee-hive; and there are several brown
sorts; but one and all attacked us so fiercely, that at times we
had to leave the victory with them, and choose some other spot
for wood. At times, where the trees were particularly suitable,
and we could not afford to leave them, we had to screw up all our
powers of endurance; the officers led the assault, as if it had
been a boarding-party, and we came off triumphantly with our
wood, but bleeding, and with skin full of the forceps of these
creatures which had remained in the wound when we brushed them
off. During the survey we cut about 700 tons of hard tropical
wood to save our coal; this fact, when our small numbers are
considered, as well the ceaseless boat work, and surveying, and
deep-sea sounding work, in which they were engaged, will give
some idea of the zeal shown by the "Basilisk's" fine crew.</p>
<p>To this bay, which our observations placed in lat. 7&deg; 29'
S. and long. 147&deg; 25' E., we gave the name of Death Adder
Bay; our men having met some death adders in cutting wood. We saw
a few deserted native huts here, but no inhabitants. Ten miles to
the west villages were seen by our exploring boats, but not
communicated with.</p>
<p>A study of the chart having shown that the coast-line for 250
miles to the west, as far as Astrolobe Gulf, was but slightly
known. I resolved to continue our coasting survey to that point.
May 14th we left Death Adder Bay, and steered north-west along
the southern shores of Huon Gulf, past undulating and alluvial
land, which succeeded the mountain spurs, and was dotted with
villages, and, thirty-five miles north-west of Death Adder Bay,
passed a projecting point of land, which had been mistaken by
D'Entrecasteaux for an island. It was almost covered with large
villages, whose inhabitants crowded to the shore to see us, and
paddled after us in canoes, making every sign of friendship, but
we could not delay to visit them. We called this point Parsee
Point, from the circumstance of the natives wearing singular
conical caps, made of tappa. Next morning, May 15th, I went to
examine a river which discharges a large body of water into the
head of Huon Gulf, but a bar at the entrance prevented our boats
passing up, and the banks were too swampy and thickly wooded to
permit of our exploring them on foot in the time at our disposal.
We named it Markham River, after the able secretary of the Royal
Geographical Society. Half a cable's length from the bar we found
twenty-six fathoms water, and at a cable's length no bottom with
a sixty fathom line. A vessel seeking to anchor here should first
send a boat in to pick up a berth. The land now trended for fifty
miles due east, forming the north side of Huon Gulf, and making
another of those far projecting promontories which we have found
so characteristic of north-eastern New Guinea. The land is bold,
mountainous, and rises to a height of 9000 feet. It was named by
me Rawlinson Range, after the president of the Royal Geographical
Society. The valleys here, and the mountain slopes clothed with
palms and tree ferns are especially beautiful and well inhabited;
and every valley appeared to be watered by a clear mountain
stream. Many canoes came off, and boldly ventured alongside to
barter tortoise shell, yams, and cocoa-nuts. They brought dogs
also, but they were not sacrificed. These people, who were of a
dark brown colour, with flat noses, and somewhat woolly
hair&mdash;more approaching the negro type than any we had seen
before, seemed to us to have a knowledge of white men, and did
not hesitate to come on board freely. Their canoes were
differently constructed from any we had seen before&mdash;the
outrigger, instead of being a heavy spar as long as the canoe,
running close to the side, and supported at each end, was here a
light spar supported only at the centre, at such an increased
distance from the canoe, as made up for the decreased weight by
greater leverage. This 15th of May was marked as an unfortunate
day, for our steam pinnace broke down, and was afterwards useless
to us. We found a precarious anchorage for the night in
forty-five fathoms, about a cable's length from shore.</p>
<p>Rounding Cape Cretin on May 16th, we stood north-west, having
the high mountainous islands of New Britain in sight to the
north, and from the tiny low islets off Cape Cretin, as well as
from the mountainous mainland, we were chased by many canoes,
whose rowers anxiously vociferated entreaties to us to stop and
barter, but the wind was fresh and fair, and I was too anxious to
economise fuel to be able to gratify them. From Cape Cretin to
Dampier's Cape King William, a distance of forty miles, the coast
line presents new features, for along the rear of the beach runs
a narrow terrace of good soil, on which a few solitary huts are
scattered, and behind this the land rises in rocky plateaux, as
regular as the lines of a fortification, divided by ravines, and
looming one above the other till they reach the inland Finisterre
Mountains. The air being beautifully clear we were able to
measure the altitude of the highest peaks of this range, which,
facing each other boldly, lift their heads far above all compeers
11,400 feet above the sea. Their relative position and their
greatness suggested irresistibly the names I gave
them&mdash;Mounts Gladstone and Disraeli, and the wish that one
of their great antitypes may emerge ere long from the clouds in
which he has veiled his lofty brows, and front his rival as of
old.</p>
<p>From Cape King William to Astrolobe Gulf, a distance of 100
miles, the coast runs in a W.N.W. line, and the shores are
"steep-to", with a depth of 350 fathoms a mile from shore. The
mountains are wooded to the beach, and are studded with many
villages. We reached Astrolobe Gulf on May 18th, the western
limit of our work, having successfully surveyed all the
previously unknown coast of New Guinea, and proved that a clear
passage exists to its northern shores and along them. A belt of
volcanic islands extends off this part of New Guinea, at
distances varying from twenty to fifty miles from the mainland.
One of these&mdash;Lesson Island&mdash;passed by us May 20th, in
lat. 3&deg; 35' S., and long. 144&deg; 47' E., was then belching
out volumes of smoke from the crater at its summit. It appeared
perfectly cone-shaped from a distance; but on near approach we
found the western side flattened, crowded with cocoa-nut trees,
and the home of a large population. The mountain is about 2200
feet high, by three miles and a half in circumference. Vegetation
climbs for 800 or 1000 feet up its sides; above which arid rocks,
and precipices riven by deep fissures, form a strange crown to
the slopes of feathery palm and tropical trees beneath. From the
parched lips of the crater a silver stream came leaping; and
surely never water looked brighter than this, now spreading
itself out in tiny threads of silver against the dark background,
now gathering itself into white cascades, and plunging into
fissure after fissure till it reached the world of green below,
and leaped from a ledge of dark rock into the sea. Large numbers
of the natives came off to us, and showed the utmost anxiety for
iron hoop. Their hair was dressed in the most preposterous
fashion&mdash;it had been suffered to grow long as a woman's, and
was drawn through a conical cane case, over the end of which it
curled. This case, which was about a foot long, and highly
ornamented with feathers and shells, was worn at the back of the
head, at right angles to it, and looked like a horn. These
people, who were of a dark copper colour and very intelligent in
manner, seemed cheerful and friendly, and I regretted much that
time did not permit us to improve our acquaintance with them.</p>
<p>Nine miles north-west of Lesson Island we found bottom at 820
fathoms, and shortly afterwards got entangled in a vast crowd of
snags, huge uprooted trunks of trees, borne on a great body of
fresh water which forced its way seaward. We had to get steam up
to clear ourselves of these obstructions, which gave us some
heavy blows, spite of care. This water, doubtless, is the outcome
of a large river somewhere in the neighbourhood of Cape Della
Torre, and is worth the attention of explorers. On May 22d, in
latitude 2&deg; 37' S., and longitude 142&deg; 7' E., we found
bottom at 2000 fathoms. Our deep-sea soundings were very
laborious to the men, as we had no fittings, and all the work had
to be done by hand. It took our reduced company three hours to
haul in these 2000 fathoms of line. We tried for deep-sea
soundings every day&mdash;no small trial to the patience of as
willing a ship's company as ever sailed.</p>
<p>We anchored in Humboldt Bay, May 23d, wishing to learn if the
Dutch had made a settlement here, a report to which effect had
reached Sydney before we left. The bay is very large, and
contains deep capacious bights, up one of which we steered, and
anchored over a coral reef in eight fathoms, where we were
presently surrounded by scores of canoes full of wild
vociferating savages, armed with formidable bows and arrows, here
first seen by us in East New Guinea. They showed no sign of fear
nor reverence; and knowing their reputation for making sudden
attacks, we kept our rifles ready. It seems singular that the
nearer we came to the seat of the Malay race proper, in New
Guinea, the more unlike the coast native became to the Malay
type, the Humboldt Bay people being almost black, with hair
inclining to be woolly, and nose and lips verging towards the
negro formation. The women were but little ornamented, and wore
the ti-ti, or grass petticoat; the men, who were unclad, were
profusely decorated with barbaric finery, some of which,
particularly a breast-plate of boar's tusks laid flat, and sewn
on to plaited cane-work, on which a ground-work of brilliant red
seeds was gummed, had quite a fine effect. Once or twice there
was every prospect of a free fight amongst the men in the canoes,
bows were bent, spears brandished, amidst furious shouting in
some dispute over their trading; and all our skill as
peace-makers was tasked. On one occasion a man parted with some
sago for a smaller quantity of iron hoop than his better half
thought due; and without more ado she seized her paddle and
belaboured him heartily over the head and shoulders; his friends,
instead of pitying his plight, shouted with merriment; he did not
retaliate, but slunk away, looking foolish.</p>
<p>The houses here are of a conical form, and thatched close down
to the ground, or to the platform on which they stand, if built
on a reef. There was no trace of a Dutch settlement; and we stood
west again after a narrow escape over a coral reef off Providence
Isle, on which the Dutch flag is flying, finding no greater depth
than 2000 fathoms in our deep-sea soundings.</p>
<p>On May 27th we had reached the western extreme of New Guinea,
about a week's sail from Amboyna, with our old ship in a very
rusty condition from her long sea work, and her decks dyed a dark
mahogany colour from the stacks of wood they had continuously
borne; so it was needful to take a little time and put her so to
rights as to do herself credit beside the Dutch men-of-war she
might meet at Amboyna. Threshold Bay, 46 miles south of the
equator, in 131&deg; 25' east longitude, seemed a likely place
for our purpose, so taking up a convenient position at nightfall,
we waited for daylight to find the anchorage.</p>
<p>During the night, however, we were swept 55 miles to the
north-west, at the rate of five knots an hour, by the strongest
ocean current we had any of us ever met. It was therefore the
evening of May 28th when we anchored off a delicious little cove
of this large open bay, before a large village, through which a
mountain stream was running; and here we saw the Dutch flag
flying.</p>
<p>The inhabitants are pure Malays, descendants of those who have
driven the aboriginal inhabitants back into the interior, and now
hold their own by the use of firearms. The Rajah of Salwatti, who
is supreme ruler at this extreme of New Guinea, came off to visit
us on the following day in a large prahu, rowed by about twenty
men, and ornamented with various banners, and an enormous Dutch
ensign. A huge gong, slung in the bow, was beaten continually as
he approached, seated under a large blue silk umbrella spread in
the stern, and we received him in conformity with such pomp. We
found him a well-informed gentlemanly man, able to speak a few
words of English; in which he told us that we were the first
English man-of-war he had seen on this coast, and expressed a
hope that many English ships would follow. We went to quarters
and showed him the power and range of our great guns, which
seemed to astonish him not a little: and he then exchanged gifts
with me, presenting me with some live cassowaries,* a tree
kangaroo, and some beautiful bird of paradise skins, which I
returned with a regulation sword, giving him also a quantity of
tea and sugar, which he said was the greatest luxury he could
have. He then took his leave with much ceremony, and landed at
the village, where the prahu was hauled above high-water mark,
and we thought we had done with him; but no, the Rajah doffed his
robe of state, and launching in a small canoe, with two men to
paddle, came off to the ship as a trader of bird skins. Very keen
bargains he drove, coaxing fowling-pieces, powder, shot, and
pistols from the officers for his skins, over which we repented
afterwards at our leisure. The Dutch, or Hollanders, as the
Malays termed them, seemed to be in small repute here.</p>
<p class="foot">[* One of these is now in the Zoological Gardens,
London.]</p>
<p>Having completed our painting and smartening-up on May 30th,
we bade our last adieu to New Guinea, and passing through Pitt
Straits between the islands of Battanta and Salwatti, where the
scenery is very beautiful, found the tide so fierce against us
that, steaming seven knots, we barely held our own. We arrived at
Amboyna on June 2d, where we experienced every attention from the
governor and from Lieutenant-Commander Doorman, H.N.M.S. "Bali",
and greatly enjoyed our return to the comforts of civilised life.
Here we met the zealous Russian traveller Mr. Miklucko Macklay,
who had spent eighteen months amongst the New Guinea people at
Astrolobe Gulf, and concerning whose fate I had been instructed
to make inquiries. He was able to clear up some of our
perplexities, amongst others, our ignorance as to the natives'
manner of disposing of their dead, we having seen no graves but
those at Discovery Bay and Skelton Island. He told us that they
bury their dead in the houses they have lived in, and disinter
the remains at the expiration of six months, when they hang the
skull up, destitute of the lower jaw, which is kept as an
ornament. But at the eastern end of New Guinea the skulls we saw
hung up were all perfect, and the jaw-bones worn as bracelets by
the men were, by unmistakable signs, described to us as those of
enemies whom they had killed and eaten.</p>
<p>Mr. Macklay's experiences generally corroborated ours, and
went to prove that the Papuans lead a quiet sort of
life&mdash;the men fishing, hunting, and making canoes and
weapons, and the women tilling the ground, carrying burthens, and
doing the housework. He did not speak of any wars or fightings,
and the solitary bloodless engagement seen by us seems to show
that they know the value of their lives. Mr. Macklay had been
brought off from Astrolobe Gulf by the Russian corvette
"Izumrud". The "Izumrud", after five days' stay on the coast of
New Guinea, had 130 sick on arrival at Amboyna. The "Basilisk",
during her many months there, spent in ceaseless labour, had
almost an immunity from sickness; a difference consequent, in my
opinion, on the superior cleanliness of our English seamen, who,
besides bathing in the sea nearly every day, enjoyed after each
day's work a freshwater tub in the forecastle.</p>
<p>The traveller was in a deplorable state of health, and not
expected to survive when we left; but I have since heard welcome
news of his recovery.</p>
<p>It will easily be supposed that our men greatly enjoyed their
run on shore at Amboyna; the morals of the place were, however,
in a very low state, and we left it with anything but favourable
ideas of the Dutch as colonists. The absence of energy, the
number of government monopolies, and the dislike with which their
rulers are regarded by the native population, forced themselves
on the attention.</p>
<p>Fanned by a gentle monsoon, we sailed through the Molucca
Sea&mdash;every sail set&mdash;not a cloud in the sky&mdash;not
the sign of a squall in the horizon&mdash;as if over charmed
waters. We postponed all drills, and gave the men perfect rest;
pleasant indeed to them after their unusually trying work. The
thought of "home" filled, I think, every heart. These days were
full of the feeling that most of us would wish the last days of
life to bring with them&mdash;that of labour done&mdash;done to
the full of all our powers&mdash;of rest in the present&mdash;of
hope of speedy reunion with friends long unseen.</p>
<p>Beautiful islands succeeded each other, rising like faint blue
clouds on the horizon, gradually filling out and warming in form
and colour, and sinking behind us again, to be forgotten soon,
for our thoughts flew all before us now.</p>
<p>We arrived at Singapore on June 29th, and here our able
surveyor, Lieutenant Dawson, left us for Sydney, taking with him
our faithful little steam cutter, now put in good repair, to be
returned to the New South Wales Government.</p>
<p>Our pennant was hauled down at Sheerness after an eventful
commission, thirty-nine days short of four years, on December 15,
1874.</p>

<h3>SUPPLEMENTARY CHAPTER.</h3>
<p align="center"><small>OUR DUTY TO NEW GUINEA AND
POLYNESIA.</small></p>
<p><small>MOST</small> men who have pondered on the future of the
islands lying on the north and east Australian shores, and our
concern in it, have felt that sooner or later we shall find
ourselves called on to decide on a plan of action with regard to
the races that inhabit them, which, working perhaps from small
beginnings at a few points, will by force of natural expansion
eventually cover the whole ground. How shall we treat the South
Sea Islands and that part of New Guinea which is not Dutch? The
question is not a new one&mdash;it sleeps at times, as other
affairs of the Empire press, and again awakens; it has just
received an answer at Fiji; it asks for one at present in New
Guinea&mdash;it sleeps, but never dies; for the causes that
prompt it, the issues depending, give it a sure vitality. It may
be asked hastily by some "Why is this question ours?" but a
little thought will bring it home. England, as represented by
Australia and New Zealand, being the great power lying nearest to
these islands, holds the primary advantage of easy access and
proximity; English subjects have settled themselves on many of
these islands, and on some have established thriving industries,
which are increasing in importance. Lawless Englishmen have made
themselves a curse in some, and to an extent which has obliged us
to establish a sort of undeclared protectorate, by turning our
cruisers into a sea-police, charged with the repression of the
more overt acts of violence. These islands, which lay hidden for
centuries, visited alone by a chance Spaniard or English
navigator, are emerging fast from their seclusion. We want
labour, cotton, sugar, tobacco, coffee, sago, spices, cocoa-nut
oil, jute, shell, b&ecirc;che-de-mer, sandalwood&mdash;a hundred
commodities which we find they can give us, and we are determined
to have these things; we demand them with a yearly increasing
avidity. Surely then we are called on to protect these people to
the uttermost in the discharge of their good offices to us, and
to do them what good we can in return. They have seen so much of
our heathenism that we are bound in fairness to show them
something of our Christianity. We are the best colonists in the
world; we do not claim the merit of perfection for our laws and
system of government, but we believe them to be the best extant.
Our residence amongst these races, and the prevalence of our
laws, are therefore rather to be desired for them according to
our own belief, than the like connection with any other nation.
Lastly, if examination proves that strategic weakness&mdash;that
political complications with other powers may follow our neglect
to move&mdash;that alien hands may reap a rich harvest that might
have been ours, we shall, I think, be ready to confess that this
question has some affinity to us. Suppose, however, that we could
draw an arbitrary line round these islands, and determine that
across a certain space of sea no European flag should ever
float&mdash;that there should be a break here in the circulation
of the world's commerce, a non-conducting link in the chain of
human thought, would not such an enactment be a sin against the
economy of nature&mdash;be inevitably self-punished?</p>
<p>There are of course two ways of dealing with this question, we
can either annex Polynesia and East New Guinea, or we can leave
the matter to the mercy of chance. The argument against
annexation may be stated briefly thus: We have ground enough for
our emigrants to appropriate now, and for a long time to come.
The climate of a large part of New Guinea, and some of the
islands, is such that Europeans could not hope to be manual
workers there. The English character is found too often to
deteriorate when Englishmen are brought into contact with
aboriginal races, and it is therefore undesirable to increase the
extent of contact. The empire is already so large that the
central governing body is sometimes unable to find leisure to
acquaint itself with the nature and gravity of important
questions at the proper time. These island races are now happy in
their own way, and should be left so. Why should we seek to force
our "fire-water" on them, along with our Manchester
calicoes&mdash;perhaps our opium, as we did on the Chinese? May
not our occupation of these islands lead to the very extinction
of these races? Have we money over and above our present
engagements to spend? Does not Australia need all her public
funds for her internal development? Is not England saddled with
the largest national debt in the world? Do not fresh
responsibilities bring with them fresh possibilities of danger
and difficulty?</p>
<p>The argument against annexation is strong, but before
measuring it with the counter-plea, we should remind ourselves of
the precept that "the right", not "the expedient", should be the
guide of national as well as of individual conduct. All Christian
philosophy teaches us that "the right" will be found to have been
"the expedient", in the end. Woe to the nation that palters with
its conscience! its punishment is prepared; the blunted
susceptibilities, the lower standard of honour, the cruel
all-slaying lust of wealth, the coward cringing to any power that
may hurt its lower interests, which follow national faithlessness
to duty, are the causes and signs of decadence, and prelude
national death.</p>
<p>It is advanced that there is room for the present and future
requirements of our out-goers in existing colonies, and to spare,
but is a sufficiency of this space available for their purposes?
Sugar-cane, cotton, and tobacco, require conditions for their
growth, which are only to be found in a small part of Australia.
The great Australian industry of sheep-farming is largely
crippled at times for want of watered land, and suffers certain
restrictions. The interior of that great island is an arid
territory, presenting difficulties in the way of habitation which
it will task the future energies of a more matured Australia to
overcome. Our possession of vast tracts of country in North
Canada all but unpeopled&mdash;of waste lands in Ireland and
Scotland, has not been allowed to stand in the way of our
appropriation of territory that has seemed desirable. The arid
Australian centre, nay the steppes of Russia, the very desert of
Sahara itself, will doubtless be subdued and peopled, should the
world last long enough; but whilst fruitful well-watered tracts
of territory await us, it is surely impolitic to throw ourselves
upon a stern grapple with nature when all the odds are against
us. All waste of time and strength is surely a mistake, nay a
sin, against political economy, which desires to apply every atom
of useful force at its due time and place.</p>
<p>But it is as vain as it is impolitic to attempt to prescribe a
field for emigration, for it will be guided not only by
expediency, but by natural instinct. As truly as Goth and Hun,
coming forth from their birthplaces and swarming southward, were
led by an instinct which obeyed a hidden law, so truly do these
solitary forerunners of the dominant race in the South Seas,
these expeditionary bodies to New Guinea, obey a law they wot not
of,&mdash;a law stronger in action then the greed of gain, the
love of adventure, the impatience of restraint, which they
recognise in themselves.</p>
<p>Let it be granted that we have room for ourselves and our
children, but we have our grand-children to think for&mdash;the
time when Australia and New Zealand as well as England will be
constrained to throw off their thousands to find fresh homes. It
would be selfish to resolve that we will only take thought for
the needs of our own generations. It would be Quixotic to forego
present interests in favour of a possible future&mdash;it is but
justice to remember that we are as truly curators of the
inheritance of coming generations as we are heirs of the past,
bound not only to transmit what we have received but to develope
it by faithful fosterage, and to leave it as free of danger and
encumbrance looming in the future, as we can make it.</p>
<p>The climate of a great part of New Guinea would not be
prejudicial to Europeans. High land, possessing every degree of
temperature, abounds there; and the Europeans who already inhabit
islands in Polynesia appear to enjoy perfect health. The malarias
that prevail in unhealthy spots would probably depart with the
too dense growth of tropic vegetation, as ague has vanished under
the hand of the drainer in many parts of our Lincolnshire
fen-country. But unhealthy spots might surely be avoided. The
inhabitants of Queensland, who will doubtless be among the first
settlers in New Guinea, are already accustomed to a range of
temperature that will have prepared them for a warmer climate.
White men may certainly find themselves unable to undertake much
manual labour on the lower levels in New Guinea and the islands,
but they should be able to find abundant employment as directors
of coloured toilers, till such time as their descendants shall
have grown acclimatised, as the Portuguese and Spaniard in the
Brazils and Mexico, and the Englishman at New Orleans. Such a
relative position involves no more injury or degradation to the
coloured operative than it does to the English, who puts his hand
to work to which other men have applied brain and gold. We may
admit that it is an unfortunate fact that the character of the
Englishman often deteriorates when he lives among savages, but
this is not inevitable. The Englishman, however, is determined to
pitch his tent amongst them, and it is our business to prevent
this deterioration, and to protect his savage neighbour, by
applying early safe-guards of law and supervision. We have been
tardy in doing this in various parts of the world. We have too
often held aloof till matters have grown so bad as to force our
attention, and have then learned that lawlessness is a costly
evil&mdash;costly in money, blood, and honour, to those who are
forced to charge themselves with its extinction. But if many of
our countrymen have brought a stigma on the national honour by
their evil deeds, others are already living and dying for these
people, and a flood of philanthropy lies ready in England and
Australia to be poured out on these islands when opportunity is
given.</p>
<p>From the suggested difficulty of governing an empire greater
than our present no argument rises, for the burden of governing
the islands would doubtless be arranged to fall on the parliament
of a great Australian dominion, privileged to deal with all
questions not strictly imperial.</p>
<p>It is argued that the islanders appear sufficiently happy
without our intervention, but perhaps their happiness is not so
real as is supposed. Some of them suffer from famines, which a
little knowledge, forethought, or communication with mankind
would have prevented. They have no ease in old age, no comfort in
sickness, no skill in dealing with any sort of physical evil.
Violence, fraud, and bloodshed, prevail in many places; the women
are everywhere more or less slaves; cruel customs, some too
dreadful for mention&mdash;infanticide, self-mutilation, human
sacrifices, cannibalism, are the customs of some islands; and,
from an intelligence dwarfed to the narrow range of its
surroundings, from animal instincts and childish fears, hideous
religions are evolved, which keep these human souls in a most
wretched bondage. Suppose, however, these people to be content
with such things as they have for want of knowledge of better, is
their ignorance to be the boundary of our duty? Are these
countless lives to drop away like leaves from autumnal forests,
to come new again with a perpetual spring of life, and drop, and
leave no sign? Are these men to rise so far, and no further,
above the level of the brute? to build their rude huts, and bask
in the sun, as they did in the days of Quiros and Captain Cook,
to the end? never to have part and lot with the rest of the human
race, to share its toils, its victories, its rewards? If
Christianity is a good thing, have we not a right to go out into
the highways and hedges and bring in these people who are lying
in the very shadow of the empire, how and when we can? Our task
in leading them into membership with the human family would not
be a difficult one. They have not been degraded by generations of
slavery, as in Jamaica or St. Domingo; they are not possessed by
a satisfying faith in the traditions of Brahminical lore, biassed
by prejudices of caste, saturated with the antipathies of
Mohammedanism, nor imbued with the polite scepticism that follows
on the surrender of these. We should have little to undo. These
races offer an almost virgin page on which we are free to write
the whole moral code. Our acts of colonisation, the necessities
of our commerce, are bringing us into a yearly-increasing
relationship with them, and it is much within our power at
present to decide the character of this relationship&mdash;nay,
to decide on their fate; on the question of their very existence.
An issue how momentous! No single aboriginal inhabitant of Van
Diemen's Land is alive to-day; the natives of Australia are
perishing fast, and will soon be extinct. We would save the poor
remnant if we could, but it is to be feared that its doom cannot
now be averted. The type was low, and all experience proves that
the lower the type the more antagonistic is the approach of
civilisation to the immediate interests of the savage. The hunter
who requires to possess a tract of land on which a city might
stand that he may fill a few mouths, will probably starve before
there is time to absorb him into the body politic, by teaching
him the ways and uses of our civilisation.</p>
<p>Have we no atonement to make for all the innocent blood that
has lain at our door from the time that we began to drive the red
man from his hunting-grounds till now? And what other form of
atonement can we find than this of making ourselves tutors of the
childhood of these races that lie directly within our influence,
and leading them up to moral and intellectual manhood. It is no
law of nature that the aboriginal shall melt away before the
civilised race. Nature has not committed the gigantic folly of
creating millions of creatures in the form and with all the
powers of man, who are yet needless to her purposes, and for whom
there is no room in her economy. Yet some will tell us that the
extinction of the less noble races has been contemplated. The
very suitability of a race to labour in the climate in which it
is found proves the intention to perpetuate it and to use it,
whilst attaining its own highest elevation, to contribute its
quota to the general good of the world. Aboriginal races have not
perished by Nature's decree, but because of our weakness,
ignorance, and sin. Our first colonists in Australia were few,
weak, and isolated by special difficulties of
inter-communication; they led a hard-working and precarious life,
and were so absorbed in their own concerns as to be unable to
take due steps to reconcile the natives to their intrusion. They
consequently met violence by violence, till the breach between
the old and new dwellers of the soil had grown too vast to be
bridged across, and the extinction of the weaker began almost to
assume the form of a seeming necessity. Again, almost within the
memory of living men, we were ignorant of much of our duty, and
our moral standard was very low. We not only tolerated slavery;
we legislated for it; we hung for petty theft; and these things
seemed right in our eyes. Men who prided themselves on being
models of honour at home, too often forgot all the ten
commandments when they had to deal with credulous and passionate
aborigines, and thought no more shame of wringing rupees from a
Hindoo, or shooting a thieving black, than our early kings did of
fleecing the Jews. Our century is characterised by an increase of
moral light co-equal with its advance in physical power, as a
glance will show. It demands the mercy of reformatory treatment
for the criminal, and education for the masses, as zealously as
it plies the steam-engine and the telegraph wire. We know our
duty in a broad way, and are daily working out its minutiae. We
are strong enough to perform much of it, and are growing
stronger; are we wanting alone in the possession of an honest
will to make our simple neighbours friends to us and a blessing
to themselves? They are capable of receiving good at our hands;
they take kindly to Christianity, as all who have visited the
Christianised islands can testify. Many of these men are leading
noble lives at this moment; some have died martyrs to their
convictions as truly as Stephen or Paul. It is easy to say that
they are incapable of benefiting much by us. It would be just as
easy to say that a great future awaits these undeveloped races,
that they are destined to take up the torch of progress after we
have laid it down. But our commission is not to speculate; it is
to do our duty to people whose acquaintance we have made, and
intend to prosecute, without their will or against it, for our
own purposes. It seems to me that the broad containing lines of
our duty are evident, whilst the filling in must be, and may be,
left to time. Perhaps I have no right to any opinion; be it so. I
am conscious of my own ignorance and short-sightedness; conscious
that these native races have so touched my heart that I have
become their partizan, and perhaps a partial reasoner. I will
express no opinion. I will but say that I hope to see my country
take up what I conceive to be her duty, and annex New Guinea and
the islands, and thus have it in her power to start right with
the aborigines from the first; to prevent the first occasions of
mistrust, disgust, and anger, which would at once and for ever
stamp an image of greed, perfidy, and cruelty, as our likeness on
the native heart. It would seem that no great money expense is
involved at the outset in recognising our legitimate position,
and that islands rich by nature would soon become self-supporting
with respect to religion and government. The act of annexation
would cost nothing, and would but need to be followed up
gradually, as circumstances should indicate and enable, beginning
of course with the islands on which Europeans have established
themselves.</p>
<p>Missionaries have done much in many of these islands, and are
doing more. Would it not be possible to acknowledge and assist
them publicly, in view of the fact that both politically and
commercially we reap a material benefit from their efforts, and
so accelerate their success? Would it not be possible, for
example, to give a grant to the Milanesian College on Norfolk
Island, the most powerful instrument for good in the South Seas,
and thus enable it to extend itself, and send out ten instructed
native teachers for every one that it now elaborates?</p>
<p>On any island where a small white community has begun to form
itself, might not a man of good repute be selected, and endued
with some degree of magisterial power, for the due exercise of
which he might be made answerable to the captain of the next
visiting man-of-war? The very routine and form of order has a
most beneficial influence, and men often acquire a higher tone
and steadiness of purpose from a sense of responsibility. A small
reward would probably go a long way in securing the services of
such men, and they might easily by degrees become recognised by
the natives as holding the balance between English and native
interests. There may be nothing in this proposition; it is only
prompted by the feeling that it may be wise to use the material
that lies to hand at first, as far as it will reach. The
possession of the islands once accepted, a power of statesmanship
would be directed towards them sufficient to meet all
necessities&mdash;suggestions are therefore idle.</p>
<p>The responsibilities that we should have to undertake with
regard to New Guinea and the islands would be small at first, and
would only increase with our ability to meet them. We should,
doubtless, be bound by a new obligation to labour in the
direction of Christianising, and making them law-abiding; but
this is a responsibility which it is not only our direct
self-interest to assume, but one which would deliver us from the
greater, of perpetually putting down lawless English ruffianism
and unmeasured native reprisals, with a strong hand. I need, I
think, add nothing to what I have said in the body of the book as
to the value of the commodities that await us in New Guinea and
some of the islands, and the capabilities of soil for growing
various crops. I have spoken of what I have seen simply and
briefly, and not ventured to express much opinion as to future
possibilities, feeling that my opinion is of no account, whilst
my testimony as an eye-witness may be of some little value to
intending settlers. On the political aspects of the annexation
question I have no right or inclination to say a word. I know
that the fact of Australia's strength and peace, lying in the
circumstance of her isolation and the absence of near contending
interests, is as patent to all as it is to me, as also the
knowledge that a foreign power established in New Guinea might
easily prove a troublesome neighbour, especially in the event of
its home government being at war with the mother country. But I
also know that the attention of our statesmen has been turned to
this question of annexation, and I have the happy faith of an
Englishman in their judgment. Another view of the subject has
more attraction for me. Of the three great islands that lie in a
line, Van Diemen's Land, Australia, and New Guinea, we have long
known that the geological formation is continuous from Victoria
to Van Diemen's Land; we now know that it is equally continuous
in Queensland and New Guinea. Can any one think without emotion
of the possibilities which such a range of latitude presents? Is
it not as though Nature herself has striven to show us that she
has here laid down the noble proportions of an empire, and bids
us not curtail it for our children.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>MY</small> attention having been called of late to
several schemes for colonising New Guinea, and to a very natural
want of knowledge on the part of the public press as to what
localities are fit or unfit for white settlement, I was induced
to write the following letter to the <i>Times</i>, with the hope
that the information it contains might be useful. I now reprint
it, with the intention of making such slight additions as the
simultaneous appearance of a letter from the Rev. S. M'Farlane,
containing debateable matter, seems to have rendered
necessary.</p>
<p align="center">NEW GUINEA.<br>
<br>
<small>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "TIMES."</small></p>
<blockquote>Sir&mdash;I did not expect to have to request you to
grant the favour of inserting a first and last letter from me on
the New Guinea question, as I have no direct or indirect personal
interest in any attempt to colonise New Guinea, my sole
connection with the subject lying in the accident of my having
been the volunteer explorer whose work has opened out an unknown
coast to enterprise; but I find myself compelled to write,
because such constant applications for information are made to me
as render me anxious to deliver myself by answering, according to
the best of my knowledge, once for all. Since sending you some
remarks on Mr. Stone's letter, too, I have been addressed by some
of the promoters of a new Association for colonising New Guinea
with respect to the reflections thrown on Her Majesty's ship
"Basilisk's" charts, and requested to make some statement which
may restore a confidence to their public, which they declare to
have been appreciably shaken. Lastly, being conscious that I have
spoken in strong terms before the Royal Geographical Society and
Colonial Institute of the richness of portions of the country in
question, and seeing that some confusion exists in the minds of
intending settlers as to which are the desirable parts, I think a
few words of explanation and warning are perhaps due.<br>
<br>
As to the character of this country, I can only speak generally
within the limits of a letter. The New Guinea coast north of
Torres Straits, as far east as Yule Island, appears to be an
almost unbroken level, of swampy, mangrove-covered, and probably
malarious country, on the low dreary shores of which the surf
breaks unchecked by any barrier reef; a home of the black Papuan
race, and wholly unsuited for white occupation.<br>
<br>
Reaching Yule Island, some thirty miles west of Redscar Bay, we
find a change. The Owen Stanley range approaches the coast to
within twenty or twenty-five miles; but the high and healthy land
of their slopes is cut off from the sea-board by a belt of this
same low, mangrove-covered swamp, through which the rivers
discovered by Her Majesty's ship "Basilisk" will in time afford
steam-water ways, for their currents are too rapid for sail or
oar, to the high lands within. At Redscar Head, thirty-five miles
east of Yule Island, an entire change is found to have obtained;
the shore is sheltered by a great barrier reef, which uprears
itself from bottomless depths, at a distance of from four to ten
miles from the shore, inside which lies calm navigable water,
which ripples up to a coral beach, backed by round-topped
swelling hills, openly timbered with rich tropical valleys
between. From this point to the extreme east of New Guinea, the
coast, as far as my knowledge and judgment go, is suitable for
white settlement, and it is peopled by a mild Malayan race, with
which it seems possible to live on terms of easy friendship.<br>
<br>
The three considerable islands, Hayter, Basilisk, and Moresby,
which lie off the east end of New Guinea, and command the new
route, are, I think, suitable for white habitation, especially
the last, which attains an elevation of 1500 feet, and is larger
and more fertile than the others. The sago palm is particularly
prolific on this island, and its harbours are numerous. The
north-eastern shores of New Guinea are apparently more tropically
luxuriant than the south-eastern, and their lofty mountains,
where a cool temperature is obtainable, appear more accessible.
There is no barrier reef to create a succession of secure
harbours, but the anchorages are sufficiently good and numerous.
It must, however, be remembered that the natives, after passing
Cape Vogel, appear to be a treacherous and savage race.<br>
<br>
With regard to the natural wealth of this country, some
certainties, probabilities, and possibilities, exist, which
should not be confounded, but disentangled and rated according to
their value. First, then, as to the certainties:&mdash;<br>
<br>
New Guinea is rich in timber, which ought to form an immediate
article of export&mdash;and here I would speak a word of warning
against indiscriminate and wasteful felling, by pointing
attention to the New Hebrides group, where the supply of sandal
wood, once bountiful, has been all but exhausted by wasteful
treatment.<br>
<br>
New Guinea is fruitful in the sago palm, and the yield might be
increased so as to form a permanent and paying export. Yams and
roots are abundant, and might be cultivated to any extent for
food or export; but the main source of wealth in New Guinea at
present is the cocoa-nut, of which the supply appeared to me to
be practically unlimited. I can scarcely give a better idea of
the value of the cocoa-nut harvest than by quoting from a late
Report of Consul Miller, of Tahiti, who says that the value of
the coprah (dried cocoa-nut kernels) exported from Tahiti in 1874
was &pound;20,191, and that of the cocoa-nut oil (311 tons)
&pound;11,190. These products, actually in existence, would
doubtless be the first support of an infant colony, and to them I
think its immediate attention should be directed.<br>
<br>
The probabilities are as follows:&mdash;Pearl-shell,
b&ecirc;che-de-mer, and tortoise-shell fisheries would doubtless
offer a paying return, but would need time and material for their
development.<br>
<br>
Tens of thousands of acres of low land could probably be
cultivated for rice, cotton, and sugar-cane with profit. On my
late visit to the New Hebrides group I was struck by the
excellence of its increasing cotton plantations, and felt the
importance of English industry in this direction as tending to
make us sufficiently independent of the American supply. The
cultivation of such crops is not, however, a task for European
labour, and would doubtless fall to the lot of the Chinese in New
Guinea, whose importation would be a matter of time. Jute and
other fibres are also among the products existent in New Guinea.
We found steel sand in Hall Sound and Milne Bay. The high grass
lands, which, as far as my observation went, seemed to be better
watered than the generality of Australian pastures, would
doubtless afford runs to millions of sheep and cattle, and much
of the high land appears suitable for coffee culture.<br>
<br>
On the possible sources of wealth in New Guinea, by which I
intend the mineral, too much stress has in my opinion been laid,
and this with the risk of attracting the least valuable, because
the least plodding, class of colonists. The only sign of mineral
wealth seen by the "Basilisk's" company were the fragments of
gold quartz picked up by us at Fairfax Harbour, Port Moresby. It
is probable, for several reasons, that a mountainous country like
New Guinea has not been forgotten by Nature in respect of
minerals; but we must await the verdict of a geological survey as
to the accessibility and amount of such deposits before we allow
a consideration of them to enter into any calculation. The
postponement of the discovery of gold in New Guinea is doubtless
to be desired, for the restraint and assuredness of established
law, the existence of easy inter-communication, the creation of a
sufficient food supply, and the presence of a large balance of
population engaged in the regular industry of civilised life are
needed to mitigate the evils attending a gold rush, and to turn
the new wealth with least delay into its true channels. The wish
that no gold may be found in New Guinea can be indulged in only
by those who do not travel beyond first aspects, who fail to
perceive that solvent and purifying forces exist in a healthy
body politic, which, working by natural laws, transmute such
evils as may be dreaded here into final good, and who fail to
consider the impetus that such an accidental force must give to
the development of a country.<br>
<br>
I heartily wish the expedition success, but do not feel myself in
a position to speak with any authority as to its prospects.
Success or disaster will wait on the venture, as the conditions
for prosperity are complied with or despised. It will suggest
itself that a thorough understanding with the natives is the
first essential. The colony should have good staying power in the
shape of adequate support from its English and Australian
founders for the first two years of its existence; after which,
supposing the organisation to be good and a system of mercantile
connection with the required markets to have been established,
the colony ought to be able to stand alone.<br>
<br>
As to the surveying work done by Her Majesty's ship "Basilisk" I
need say nothing to sailors, but if it be in any way necessary
that I should come forward for the satisfaction of the special
public interested, I am willing to specify what the "Basilisk"
has done and not done.<br>
<br>
It must be understood that no chart is ever implicitly relied on
by navigators unless it is shown to be in all its parts the
results of a triangulated survey, and not even then in any part
which is left destitute of soundings. A running survey of a coast
professes only to delineate the coast-line, and mark such dangers
as the surveyors may have been able to discover, and does not
claim to be an exhaustive survey. A chart is only incorrect when
the coast-line is inaccurately drawn, when soundings are given
and clear water indicated where reefs or other obstructions are
afterwards found to exist, or where dangers are shown but not
accurately fixed.<br>
<br>
The triangulated, sounded-out surveys of the "Basilisk" embrace
about 50 miles of the south coast of New Guinea in Torres
Straits, including the islands of Saibai, Talbot, and Cornwallis,
and the Great Warrior reef; also a space at the east end of New
Guinea, containing about 50 miles of latitude and 75 of
longitude, which includes the gateway of the new
Australian-Chinese route round the east end of New Guinea,
together with the archipelago of islands and reefs there brought
to light, and a portion of the south and western shores of the
D'Entrecasteaux islands. The "Basilisk's" running survey of the
previously unknown coast of New Guinea extends from East Cape to
Huon Gulf, a distance of 278 miles as the crow flies, and further
runs on from Huon Gulf to Astrolobe Bay, between which two latter
points the coast-line was partially known, making here a total of
480 miles as the crow flies, or a real coast-line (in consequence
of its irregularities) of about 700 miles. These are the
"Basilisk's" surveys proper, the other work consisting merely in
the making of some additions to the existing New Guinea charts,
of which the work done at Yule Island, lately alluded to, was an
instance.&mdash;I am, Sir, yours faithfully,</blockquote>
<p align="right">J. MORESBY, Captain, R.N.   </p>
<blockquote>The Glen, Queenstown.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. M'Farlane's letter is as follows:</p>
<p align="center"><small>TO THE EDITOR OF THE
"TIMES."</small></p>
<blockquote>Sir&mdash;I have just read the report, in the
<i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>, of a large and influential meeting
held in that town with reference to a contemplated expedition to
New Guinea, consisting of a number of persons who are emigrating
thither with their families, intending to settle on Yule Island,
"with a view to opening up a trade with the Australian ports in
the products of the island." These products are, according to
their statement, "Cocoa-nut oil, palm oil, sandal wood, mahogany,
cedar, ebony, cinnamon, cloves, nutmegs, mace, arrowroot, sago,
and sugar-cane." The marine products are also stated to be
"b&ecirc;che-de-mer, pearl-shell, turtle-shell, and trepang."<br>
<br>
Now, Sir, let it be distinctly understood that I very heartily
sympathise with all attempts to open up New Guinea and develope
its resources, whether those efforts be of a missionary,
scientific, or commercial character. Although a missionary, and
convinced that missionaries make the best pioneers among savages,
and that there can be little real civilisation or improvement of
the natives without the religious element, still I do not desire
to see the civilisation of numerous tribes left to missionaries
alone, although the improved social condition of the South Sea
Islanders abundantly proves that the missionary pioneer does not
confine himself to teaching the natives to say prayers and sing
psalms.<br>
<br>
I rejoice in the efforts of such enterprising men as M.
D'Alberte, the Italian naturalist, and such expeditions as that
fitted out by the distinguished colonist who has just arrived
among us from Sydney. These gentlemen have the means of supplying
themselves with provisions, etc., and of moving from one part of
the island to another, or leaving it altogether, when they
please; and, moreover, every part of the island is attractive to
the naturalist, as every little village is to the missionary. My
object in writing is to offer a little information, advice, and
warning to those who contemplate emigrating to New Guinea, for I
consider that silence would be as culpable and cruel on the part
of those who, like myself are acquainted with the facts of the
case, as the statements are outrageously misleading contained in
the "programme" from which the Rev. Dr. Lang quoted the above
extracts. It is evident that the emigrants expect to find on
their arrival at Yule Island the products mentioned in that
"prospectus or programme". I pity them if they come relying upon
anything of the kind, for they will not be able to obtain any one
of them. Even cocoa-nuts and sugar-cane are very scarce on the
island, and both are dear. The natives wanted from us an axe for
two cocoa-nuts. All may be had on the mainland, I have no doubt;
but will it pay to collect them? For cocoa-nuts they must go to
the west; for sago, to the head of the gulf; for spices, round to
the west and north; for ebony, round to the eastern side of the
peninsula, whence I got some curiosities carved in that wood; for
sandal wood and mahogany I don't know where they must go; we have
not yet seen any on the island. Fancy a few persons settling in
Cornwall to trade in articles which are only to be had in Hull,
Aberdeen, and more distant places, the only way of getting at
these ports being by sea, round a dangerous and unsurveyed
coast!<br>
<br>
The emigrants further state in their prospectus that "It is their
intention on landing to at once place themselves on friendly
terms with the natives", which I think may be easily done. We
have not yet found any difficulty in accomplishing this desirable
end. They must, of course, be prepared to submit to a good deal
of annoyance and pilfering, or choose the much worse alternative
of coming to open hostility with the natives. Those at and about
Yule Island, however, are much more honest and friendly than the
people of Port Moresby.<br>
<br>
They also state that it is their intention "to keep up a direct
and constant communication, vi&acirc; Somerset, to Sydney by the
Torres Straits mail. It is understood that no difficulty will
arise in accomplishing the same." Certainly not between Somerset
and Sydney, but how about the communication between Yule Island
and Somerset? Dr. Lang says "that the plan of going by the Torres
Straits mail steamer as far as Somerset is a very good one; and
if a small steam launch were carried on the deck of the steamer,
the little party could get over to New Guinea with great
facility, and at small expense." It is evident that the good old
doctor has not crossed the Gulf during the S.-E. season; had he
been with us last week he would have found that it is dangerous
crossing in ordinary S.-E. weather, even in the steamship
"Ellengowan", the mission steamer of the London Missionary
Society, which is 80 feet long, and has proved her sea-going
qualities by steaming out from England. When we first came here,
four years ago, we found it impossible to beat to windward in the
gulf, although the vessel we had chartered was a smart schooner
of 100 tons. After "hammering at it" for four days without
gaining a mile, we were obliged to enter and beat up inside the
Great Barrier Reef of Australia. During the N.-W. season there
are times when "a small steam launch" might cross the gulf.<br>
<br>
There is one product of the country not mentioned by the
emigrants, but which they are likely to get before any of the
others&mdash;viz. fever. We have not yet found any part of the
coast, or any island in Torres Straits free from the dangerous
malady, Cape York and Port Moresby not excepted. Our Polynesian
teachers and their families have been sadly reduced; they cannot
stand the climate as well as Europeans. Although our mission is
still young, we have lost no less than 21 of our number&mdash;17
by the diseases of the climate, and four by the clubs of the
savages. These are facts which it may be well for those proposing
to emigrate to New Guinea to consider. It is true that a few of
the 17 had diseases in their system which this climate rapidly
developed and brought to a fatal termination; humanly speaking
they would have lived long in their own country.<br>
<br>
There is positively nothing to be had on the south-east
peninsula, so far as we know, which is of any commercial value.
Pearl-shell and b&ecirc;che-de-mer may be found on the coast, and
gold in the interior, as in Australia.<br>
<br>
Cotton, coffee, etc., may be cultivated, but labour would have to
be imported. Missionaries, scientific, and prospecting
expeditions, are the only persons who should visit New Guinea for
some time to come. None should come here who are not well
supplied with provisions, and with the means of leaving the
island if necessary. I know that many will not be disposed to
give this letter the consideration to which it is entitled,
because it proceeds from a missionary, supposing that we are
anxious to prevent traders from settling in New Guinea. It will
certainly be very unfortunate for the future of New Guinea if a
number of reckless fellows come here, determined to make their
way with the "almighty revolver", and so frustrate their own ends
and endanger our lives. The natives are quiet and friendly all
along the coast; they know very little of foreigners, and are
disposed to regard us as their friends; it would be a pity to
alter that impression and create one of hostility.<br>
<br>
When I arrived in Sydney from our first visit to Redscar Bay I
found the unfortunate "Maria" preparing to leave for that place,
and learnt something of the party from a gentleman who
contemplated forming one of their number. I was requested to
visit the "Maria", and meet some of the leading members of the
expedition, which I did, giving them what information I could
about the place and people. Knowing that the captain was ignorant
of the locality, and that it was the worst season which they
could have selected, I advised them not to go. I am now offering
the same advice to those contemplating emigrating to Yule Island,
who are more likely to find their graves than the treasures they
anticipate. The time for emigration has not yet arrived. Wait at
least till the result of the Macleay expedition is known. I can
only advise such to emigrate as are in a position which the
natives declare us to be in&mdash;viz.&mdash;obliged to leave our
own country.&mdash;Yours very truly,</blockquote>
<p align="right">S. M'FARLANE.   </p>
<blockquote>On board the "Ellengowan", Yule Island, July
11.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. M'Farlane's letter, evidently written with the best
intentions, is to be respected accordingly; but whilst
sympathising with the spirit in which he writes, and agreeing
with some of his statements, I cannot but see that he falls into
some mistakes that call for notice.</p>
<p>He commences in a way calculated to produce an erroneous
impression, when he states "that he had just read the report, in
the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>, of a large and influential
meeting held in that town, with reference to a contemplated
expedition to New Guinea, consisting of a number of persons who
are emigrating thither with their families, intending to settle
on <i>Yule Island</i>." Now the meeting at Sydney was fully aware
that Yule Island is but a tiny islet about two miles long by
three-quarters of a mile broad, situated off a low malarious part
of the coast; it could not and did not therefore confine its
attention to Yule Island, but dealt with a series of resolutions
in favour of the annexation of New Guinea, and the colonisation
of that vast island. Mr. M'Farlane having thus placed the
colonists in a locality where they will certainly never settle as
a body, goes on to say that these emigrants are prepared to find
on their arrival at Yule Island "Cocoa-nut oil, palm oil, sandal
wood, mahogany, cedar, ebony, cinnamons, cloves, nutmegs, mace,
arrowroot, sago, sugar-cane", ready for their enrichment. It is
scarcely likely that any assemblage of commonly informed people
would have expected this islet to prove such a garden of the
Hesperides, but if any man in England has been bitten by such a
wild idea, Mr. M'Farlane's letter may help to cure him.</p>
<p>He proceeds to state that sugar-cane and cocoa-nuts are so
dear on Yule Island that an axe was asked by the natives in
payment for two cocoa-nuts. We in the "Basilisk" found them
fairly plentiful there, though Yule Island is not a seat of the
cocoa-nut, but we observed that whilst the natives refused to
take our axes as barter, being then totally ignorant of the value
of iron, they were willing to part with anything they had in
exchange for polished pearl-shell ornaments.</p>
<p>Mr. M'Farlane must surely see that the poverty,&mdash;the very
extinction of this little island, would have no effect on a
scheme for the colonisation of New Guinea. Why, therefore, should
he give his ideas of its poverty such prominence?</p>
<p>He continues&mdash;"All" (<i>i.e</i>. the produce specified)
"may be had on the mainland, no doubt, but will it pay to collect
them? For cocoa-nuts they must go to the west" (where does the
vague "west" lie?); "for sago to the head of the gulf" (Papua);
"for spices round to the west and north; for ebony round to the
eastern side of the peninsula."</p>
<p>Here Mr. M'Farlane commits himself to certain authoritative
statements, leaving his readers to take for granted that he is
fully competent to make them.</p>
<p>But <i>do</i> Mr. M'Farlane's experiences in New Guinea
warrant this? Does he possess any acquaintance at all with the
great island, beyond that acquired in visiting the
mission-stations of Katow in Torres Straits, and those at Yule
Island, Redscar Bay, and Port Moresby, which latter lie within
sixty miles of each other? Has he ever visited the eastern shores
of New Guinea, which stretch about 260 miles to the east from
Port Moresby, or the northern shores of the island? Had he done
this, or even conversed with any one who has, he would have
written&mdash;"For cocoa-nuts they must go to the
<small>EAST</small>; for sago, also to the <i>East</i>; for
spices, as yet nowhere in New Guinea; for ebony, probably to all
the great tropical forests." The cocoa-nut and sago palm were
found by us to be more plentiful at the extreme East Cape of New
Guinea than anywhere else.</p>
<p>The difficulties Mr. M'Farlane speaks of in crossing from
Somerset to Eastern New Guinea do not appear to me to be such as
are inevitable. We found that the meteorology of the east coast
during the months of February, March, April, and May 1873,
differed materially from that of Torres Straits.</p>
<p>Leaving Torres Straits in the first week in February, when
heavy rains and strong north-west gales prevailed, the "Basilisk"
remained in the vicinity of Redscar Bay till the first week in
March, and experienced calm clear weather, with the exception of
one strong breeze from the N.W., with rain. On our return to
Torres Straits in March, constant winds from the N.W. and rain
prevailed, which were left behind as we retraced our way to
Eastern New Guinea, where, from March 20th to May 8th, we again
experienced continuous fine weather. It seems therefore early to
express a decided opinion on the meteorology of New Guinea. I
agree with Mr. M'Farlane that some risk would be run in
attempting to cross the Gulf of Papua in a small steam launch
during the south-east monsoon; but the distance is only 250
miles, and taking the opportunity of fine weather, I should not
hesitate to undertake the crossing during the monsoon, whilst I
should at all times feel perfectly safe in attempting it in a
good seaworthy decked boat. The passage between Somerset and East
New Guinea is not in fact so much to be dreaded as much of the
navigation of the English Channel.</p>
<p>Mr. M'Farlane descants on the unhealthiness of New Guinea, and
supports his opinion by making a statement as to the mortality of
the native Polynesian Christian teachers employed by the London
Missionary Society in New Guinea, but he instances no case of a
white man suffering from climatic causes.</p>
<p>It has already been seen that Mr. M'Farlane, except at Port
Moresby (which the missionaries have publicly announced to be a
healthy locality), has no knowledge of the high and presumably
healthy parts of New Guinea, which are alone fitted for the white
man's occupation; but his facts are so striking, that I would
fain direct his attention to some of their causes. I am
satisfied, from the evidence which came under my own eyes, as I
think he will be on consideration, that influences other than
climatic arrayed themselves against the lives of these poor
creatures.</p>
<p>During the first four years which passed after the native
teachers were established in New Guinea, they were unwisely
scattered at stations in Torres Straits and at Redscar Bay,
whilst the agent of the London Missionary Society residing at
Cape York (Somerset), had no adequate means of visiting and
supplying them with necessary food. The teachers and their
families were left unguided and unprovided amongst savages, who
refused to supply them with food gratis, and in a country whose
produce was different from that of their native islands. The
result was that when, in 1872-3, the "Basilisk" visited these
poor creatures, she found them in such a deplorable state from
want of sufficient food and medicines that several had died, and
others were only saved by being brought on board, and given
nourishing food and proper medicines. These facts, together with
the opinion of the surgeon of the "Basilisk", were officially
reported by me to the agent of the London Missionary Society at
the time. By the possession of the "Ellengowan" missionary
steamer, the mission is now placed on a more satisfactory
footing, and it is probable that we shall henceforth cease to
hear of so heavy a death-rate amongst the native teachers, even
in the unhealthy parts, where they have, in my opinion, been
unwisely settled. It should also be remembered that these native
teachers came from various South Sea Islands, more than a
thousand miles distant, where all the conditions of their lives
were different.</p>
<p>The general health of the men of the "Basilisk" ship's company
during the eight months spent in New Guinea, when they were
exposed to all the vicissitudes of climate, in open boats, on
detached service up rivers, on shore-work, surveying, visiting
natives, and cutting 700 tons of wood for steaming purposes, was
exceptionally good. The men occasionally suffered from boils,
caused by a scarcity of fresh provisions; and whilst on the
<i>North</i> coast of New Guinea a low fever prevailed amongst us
for a time, but it was of a mild type, soon passing over, and
leaving no bad effects.</p>
<p>The allusion made by Mr. M'Farlane to the loss of the "Maria"
is not fortunate, as that vessel was wrecked about 800 miles from
New Guinea. Nor can the results of the Macleay Expedition affect
the question of the colonisation of East New Guinea, as Mr.
Macleay has only attempted to explore the shores and rivers of
the malarious coast north of Torres Straits, inhabited by the
black, naked, hostile Papuan.</p>
<p>The following information was supplied to me by Mr. Edwin
Redlich, master of the schooner "Franz", who went to search for
pearl-shell on the extreme west of New Guinea, where the Dutch
have so long held nominal sway.</p>
<p>It has since been published, for the information of seamen, by
the Admiralty, and I introduce it here in order that the reader
may contrast what it tells of the fierce bloody nature of the
black Papuans of West New Guinea, with the mild, comparatively
inoffensive, manners of the races inhabiting the eastern end of
the great island.</p>
<p>Galewo Strait separates the considerable island of Salwatti
from the west end of New Guinea. The Rajah of Salwatti,
afterwards, in conversation with me, confirmed the truth of
Captain Redlich's statement:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="center">GALEWO STRAIT AND SALWATTI ISLANDS.</p>
<blockquote>On the 10th November came to an anchor off a small
island, which the natives called "Soron". There is a large
settlement of Malayas and Papuans, who fly the Dutch colours, and
are the immediate subjects of the Rajah of Salwatti. On the 12th
November sent the two large boats, with eighteen men all told,
for a three weeks' cruize, fitted out with all necessaries. My
chief mate, Mr. H. Schluetor, a native of Hamburg, had the
command. I could not send more men, as eleven were laid up with
the climatic fever.<br>
<br>
<i>Friday</i>, 6<i>th December</i>.&mdash;Boats not back, which
made me very uneasy, all the more as I had received tidings that
the two boats had been seen three days ago not far from Soron;
which information, however, proved to be erroneous
afterwards.<br>
<br>
<i>Saturday</i>, 7<i>th December</i>.&mdash;Boats not back.
To-day a Soron native told me that a canoe had come from the
southward with the news that the boats had been seen steering
towards a place on the mainland of New Guinea, where the natives
are very treacherous, and known to be very dangerous. The same
Soron man told me that a man-of-war was lying at Gillolo. I
concluded at once to man a boat and send it in search of the two
missing ones. I engaged two natives from Soron island to act as
pilots.<br>
<br>
<i>Thursday</i>, 12<i>th December</i>.&mdash;Late in the evening
the whaleboat returned; they had not seen anything of the boats.
I had given the man in charge of this boat a letter, in which all
the particulars are stated to the captain of the man-of-war, but
the ship had left when my messenger arrived at Gillolo. Found out
afterwards that it was an Italian man-of-war. Friendly natives
had told the men that the two boats had been seen steering
towards the land, and that they had not returned. They all
expressed their opinion that the men must have been murdered. I
could not leave this place without having tried all and every
means to ascertain the fate of my men, and I concluded to ask the
Rajah of Salwatti for his aid. Weighed on the 13th December, and
arrived at Salwatti on the same day, but found that the rajah was
away on a cruize.<br>
<br>
<i>Sunday</i>, 15<i>th December</i>.&mdash;The rajah returned,
and from the account he gave me respecting the ferociousness of
the Papuans, I lost the last hope for the safety of my
unfortunate men. The rajah granted me every assistance, and I
supplied him with fire-arms, but he declined my company, as he
thought it would place his weak party in danger.<br>
<br>
<i>Saturday</i>, 21<i>st December</i>.&mdash;The rajah returned
and brought back six guns, a double-barrelled breech-loader, one
revolver, the mate's watch, totally broken, his jacket, a
compass, and a cartridge-pouch. He had recovered them in the
bush, and expressed an opinion that the men had been cooked and
eaten. I could not make up my mind to leave this place without
having been on the spot myself, and tried to persuade the rajah
to render me his assistance. At last I succeeded, and the day for
starting was fixed for that day week. In the meantime we prepared
for the expedition, made cartridges, and practised our blacks
with firearms.<br>
<br>
<i>Monday</i>, 30<i>th December</i>.&mdash;The rajah came on
board with three proas containing forty-five natives, and all
their war implements. I went in the chief's proa, my steward, a
Singapore Malaya, and a Fiji boy. The second mate with two men
went in another proa; and another Fiji man in a third proa. All
had joined the expedition voluntarily, and the firearms were
equally distributed. In the evening we anchored at English or
Saili point.<br>
<br>
<i>Tuesday</i>, 31<i>st December</i>.&mdash;Went from Saili point
about twelve miles farther down the coast. In going down several
proas belonging to different places under the rajah's authority
had joined our party, which now amounted to nine proas and about
120 men.<br>
<br>
<i>Wednesday</i>, 1<i>st January</i> 1873.&mdash;Went along the
coast for at least twenty miles to small islands about eight
miles distant from the mainland. The native name for these
islands is "Efmatal". This part of New Guinea is greatly
obstructed by shoals and reefs. At about midnight got under weigh
from there, and steered eastward towards the mainland.<br>
<br>
<i>Thursday</i>, 2<i>d January</i> 1873.&mdash;We have made now
at least two degrees from Salwatti, and we are now steering into
a large and beautiful river named "Crabara", pulling very fast
till 11 o'clock at night, when we anchored, and I presume we were
then at least thirty miles up the river; which must go a long way
inland. It is here half-a-mile wide; the banks are adorned with
luxuriant vegetation.<br>
<br>
Here the whole party divided, some remained at anchor, and some
went farther up the river.<br>
<br>
<i>Friday</i>, 3<i>d January</i>.&mdash;This morning two of the
proas, with three bush natives whom they had caught, returned.
One of them, according to his own confession, had been actually
engaged in the murder of my men, and boasted of having killed the
"white man". He said that the two boats had been seen lying at
anchor at Efmatal island. Three canoes from the mainland, in each
canoe fifteen men, had gone off with bananas, pine-apples, etc.,
which they gave to my men in the boats, and then quietly paddled
off to the coast. They had behaved quite friendly, and put the
mate and men off their guard. The New Guinea men had counted the
number of men in the boats, the arms, etc.<br>
<br>
The next night the savages returned and landed at the back of
Efmatal island. They found the men, with the exception of two
boys who had been left in the boats, camped on shore by their
fires. They had divided into two parties, a little apart. The New
Guinea men crawled upon them and killed them in the twinkling of
an eye, without even a cry being raised by the victims; after
that, they killed the two boys in the boats, and then brought the
latter to a place which nearly dries at low water, and here they
burnt the boats. The savages took all the bodies up the river
Crabara. There they cut off their heads, kept them for trophies,
and sold the bodies to a neighbouring tribe, who had cooked and
eaten them.<br>
<br>
The three prisoners were horrible-looking fellows, especially the
one who had helped to murder my men. They are a different race to
that inhabiting the more civilised parts of New Guinea, and
easily distinguished, and if I ever go there again I will not
give them a chance of coming near me if I can help it. After the
prisoners were well secured, all the proas went farther up the
river, and I hoped that we should go to the village "Crabara",
which is about twelve miles farther up. After having gone up for
about six miles, we heard the shells and drums right and left in
the bushes. The rajah then commanded a retreat, for he said they
might come down on us by the thousands, and we made the best of
our way down the river.<br>
<br>
<i>Saturday</i>, 4<i>th January</i> 1873.&mdash;In the morning we
anchored at Efmatal island. The cannibal was brought on shore to
the exact spot where he had killed the mate, and in front of
where the boats had been lying at anchor. He was lashed to the
very tree under which he had killed the mate, and was shot there
and then. I fired the first shot and the second mate the second,
with which he dropped down dead. As soon as he was dead the
natives cut his head off, and strapped the body to the branch of
a tree as a warning example to other cannibals who will certainly
visit here now and then. All the men had witnessed the execution,
and the rajah had given his sanction to it.<br>
<br>
The two other savages remained in the rajah's hands, and both
died a most horrible death. I witnessed the execution of one of
them. He was in the true sense of the word cut to pieces by women
and children, the widows and orphans of those who were killed in
the first expedition when the rajah went out and recovered my
guns, etc.<br>
<br>
<i>Monday</i>, 6<i>th January</i> 1873.&mdash;Arrived at
Salwatti. Stated the whole affair in several letters, and left
them in the rajah's hands. One letter directed to the captain of
the first man-of-war calling there; the second to the Prussian
Consul-General in Hamburg; the third to the Sultan of Ternate;
and the fourth to my present owners, Messrs. Barren and Austin,
of Sydney.</blockquote>
<p>When Captain Lawson's book on New Guinea appeared, I was
requested to criticise it. This I refused to do from delicacy, as
I was then engaged in the preparation of my own book, and my
feeling was to wait and simply state in that what I had myself
seen in New Guinea. Finding, however, that Captain Lawson's book
was beginning to be accepted in some quarters as an authority;
and being further appealed to for information, I sent the
following letter to the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, of May 29th,
1875:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="center">THE INTERIOR OF NEW GUINEA.</p>
<blockquote>My attention has just been directed to Captain
Lawson's book on New Guinea, and I have been called on by my
geographical friends to express my opinion as to the credibility
of the narration. This I can scarcely do becomingly, lest I
should be for a moment misconceived as claiming the status of an
explorer, whose assent or dissent must be final for the time. I
am, however, ready to state the principal points on which my
experience is opposed to that of Captain Lawson, and to indicate
instances where I meet with difficulties in his book, and should
require explanation or parallel proof for my own
satisfaction.<br>
<br>
Captain Lawson tells us that, between November 1871 and May 1872,
he formed an intention of exploring New Guinea, and organised a
small expedition for that purpose, which sailed in the brig
"Nautilus", from Sydney, on May 24th. H.M.S. "Basilisk", under my
command, arrived at Sydney on December 14th, 1871, sailed for
Torres Straits, January 15th, 1872, returned from thence to
Sydney April 5th, 1872, and left it on May 14th. I feel a
surprise that, between these dates, no word of Captain Lawson's
expedition should have reached me; nay, that he did not come to
me for information, as public attention was largely attracted to
the New Guinea coast at the time, in consequence of the
"Basilisk's" new discoveries in that quarter, and of the
disastrous fate attending the brig "Maria" expedition, which left
Sydney in January, 1872, for New Guinea.<br>
<br>
Captain Lawson says (page 2), "I accidentally met (at Sydney)
with a merchant captain who was in the habit of making trading
voyages to New Guinea." Then (page 3) "He had himself been
engaged in a bartering trade with them for several years, and
could speak their language fluently." I must unhesitatingly state
that no vessel from Sydney was in the habit of trading to the
mainland of New Guinea. Some black Papuans, inhabiting islands in
Torres Straits, are engaged in diving for pearl-shell, and paid
in kind and money, but with these islanders only has any
commercial communication been had.<br>
<br>
Page 12. "Houtree is situated on Torres Straits, in long.
143&deg; 17' 8" E., lat. 9&deg; 8' 18" S."&mdash;This position is
<i>in the sea</i>, about one mile from the west end of Bristow
Island, and six miles from the low wooded coast of New Guinea,
touching a locality marked in the Admiralty charts "shallow
flats" and "heavy rollers", surveyed by the late Captain
Blackwood, R.N., and the present hydrographer of the navy. Of
those dangers Captain Lawson takes no notice. The boats of H.M.S.
"Basilisk", by my direction, surveyed this part of the coast of
New Guinea within ten miles of the alleged position of "Houtree",
but they never heard of such a place, or of any "bay" or
"harbour" near there.<br>
<br>
Page 4. "Fifteen or sixteen native proas put off from the
shore."&mdash;Proas do not exist in Torres Straits. The ordinary
canoe is used, hollowed out of the trunk of trees.<br>
<br>
Page 4. "The joint property of half-a-dozen Chinese adventurers,
who had settled in the village."&mdash;Chinamen have no
communication whatever with this part of New Guinea; neither have
they ever settled or owned property of any kind within 600 miles
of the position assigned to Houtree.<br>
<br>
Page 5. "Papuans, very repulsive looking. . . . exceedingly
short, squat bodies, black, matted, and dirty hair, and a lithe,
monkeyish manner." The Papuans of this part of New Guinea are jet
black, remarkably tall muscular men, their hair is frizzled, and
the men usually shave their heads, and wear <i>wigs</i> so
artistically constructed that we were days amongst them without
discovering the deception.<br>
<br>
Page 5. "Curious looking fowls."&mdash;No tame fowl were seen by
us in New Guinea.<br>
<br>
Page 5. "Twelve dollars a month" (for Papuan guides).&mdash;The
mainland Papuans have no knowledge of the value of money; and why
"dollars", when the current coin of all Australian vessels
engaged in Polynesian trade is pounds, shillings, and pence? No
currency but English is used by the pearl-shellers in Torres
Straits.<br>
<br>
Page 5. "I selected two who had a knowledge of the English
language, and who were further recommended to me as having spent
the greatest part of their lives in the interior of the island.
They were sailors, and had been in the habit of making voyages to
the islands of the Indian Archipelago, in the course of which
they had picked up information; besides English, they spoke a
smattering of French, Dutch, and Portuguese, as well us several
dialects of Malays."&mdash;I can but say that this part of New
Guinea has been till now unknown to white races, and that its
inhabitants had certainly not seen a white face between the time
of the surveying voyage by H.M.S. "Fly", in 1845, and the advent
of the pearl-shellers in Torres Straits in 1865, or thereabouts.
To speak of native Papuans being "sailors", "making voyages to
the Indian Archipelago", and speaking several languages, is the
wildest flight of imagination possible, according to my
experience.<br>
<br>
Page 8. "Criminals who had become slaves."&mdash;We saw no trace
of slavery amongst them.<br>
<br>
Page 8. "They (at Houtree) were mostly engaged in fishing, and
trading with Dutch and Chinese merchants who frequented them, and
they also made voyages to the neighbouring islands, which are
colonised principally by the Dutch."&mdash;As senior naval
officer on two occasions in Torres Straits, it was my duty to
acquaint myself with all particulars relating to the various
islands; I must therefore state the fact that the Dutch have not
colonised one single island, or any ground within 600 miles of
the position given to Houtree.<br>
<br>
Page 8. "The articles they have to dispose of are spices, drugs,
gums, several kinds of wood and bark, the well-known birds of
paradise, some inferior pearls, cocoa-nuts, and monkey skins, and
many other articles of a like nature . . . From what I heard and
saw, I should say that they (the exports and imports), are very
considerable."&mdash;I have already said that no traffic has been
had with the southern mainland of New Guinea, nor do any of the
above-named commodities exist as articles of commerce in the
Torres Straits Islands. Cocoa-nuts grow there, of course, and a
few soiled bird of paradise plumes can be had as curiosities; we
obtained a few pearls from the divers, but they were found in
very small quantity. <i>B&ecirc;che-de-mer</i>, pearl-shell, and
tortoise-shell are raised to a large amount by the natives of the
Torres Straits Islands, employed by Europeans.<br>
<br>
Page 9. "I ascertained that three or four small Dutch vessels
generally called at Houtree in the course of the year, but that
some hundreds of Malay and Chinese boats visited the place in the
same period." During my command in these waters not one Dutch,
Malay, or Chinese vessel visited Torres Straits for the purpose
of commerce. A Chinese boat to reach Houtree would have to sail
about 3000 miles, and circumnavigate New Guinea. The idea of a
voyage of such extent and audacity shocks the sense of
probability. The Malay proas are unknown in Torres Straits, but
visit the Arrow Islands, about 600 miles west of the supposed
Houtree.<br>
<br>
Page 10. "Fields enclosed with railings."&mdash;Their cultivation
is of the rudest kind. Fields cannot be said to exist; there are
rough enclosures kept from the attacks of pigs by close set
stakes.<br>
<br>
Page 10. "Principal crops. . . . nutmegs. . . . occupied and
cultivated by the Chinamen."&mdash;Nutmegs are not cultivated in
this part of New Guinea; but the tree doubtless grows wild, as we
shot pigeons with the wild nutmeg in their crops.<br>
<br>
Page 11. "And the skin of a tanned yellowish hue."&mdash;The
colour of the natives is pure ebony black.<br>
<br>
Page 12. "They were well acquainted with the value of money, and
Dutch coins were in circulation amongst them."&mdash;I have
already said that the Dutch and Dutch coin are utterly unknown to
the Papuans in this part of New Guinea.<br>
<br>
Page 16. "The natives from the villages from great distances
round frequented the marsh to procure salt."&mdash;We frequently
tried, and always found the New Guinea natives most adverse to
the taste of salt.<br>
<br>
Page 19. "He said a goat."&mdash;We never saw traces of such an
animal in New Guinea, and the frightened astonishment of the
natives, on seeing a sheep on board the "Basilisk", indicated
that to the coast natives, at all events, an animal of such a
size was a novelty.<br>
<br>
Page 19. "Boiled rice was set before us, followed by roast
monkey."&mdash;Rice is unknown amongst the Papuans, and no trace
of monkeys was ever seen by us.<br>
<br>
Page 20. "The property. . . pots, kettles of European
manufacture, tools, knives. . . . skins cured for trading
purposes, fancy buttons, china ornaments. . . . some hundreds of
marbles", etc.&mdash;We never saw any such articles in Papuan
huts; indeed, there must be a touch of sarcasm here. "Fancy
buttons" for naked Papuans! The Papuan household effects seen by
us were bows and arrows, spears, stone clubs, fishing-spears,
cocoa-nut bowls, mats, shell ornaments, bird of paradise feathers
of a worthless sort, and never prepared for trading purposes,
stone adzes for agriculture, dogs, and cassowaries occasionally,
as house pets.<br>
<br>
Page 21. "Huts divided into two apartments. . . . the inner one
devoted to the use of the ladies."&mdash;We never saw such an
arrangement; the Papuan huts are large and often of two floors,
the upper one being principally used for sleeping purposes, but
we never saw any sign of the women possessing any privacy; in
fact the habits of these people are against the idea.<br>
<br>
Page 21. "Toddy prepared from the sap of the cocoa-nut
tree."&mdash;We never saw any intoxicating drink amongst the
Papuans, and were struck by the peculiarity, as the making of ava
is general amongst the South Sea Islanders.<br>
<br>
Page 25. Captain Lawson speaks of grass growing five or six feet
over his head as bending easily to the weight of the body and
yielding passage. We found it exhausting work to get through this
grass, and only succeeded in doing a mile by about three hours'
effort.<br>
<br>
Pages 31, 32. Extraordinary quietude between the hours of ten and
four in the forest is spoken of, but at daybreak a humming of
insects, screaming of parrots, chattering of monkeys, with a
thousand other sounds from birds and beasts, was heard, insomuch
that Captain Lawson "had to shout when talking." We ascended New
Guinea rivers for about twenty miles, running through the heart
of dense forests, and were impressed with the solemn, almost
painful, silence which prevailed at all hours, unbroken save by
the scream of a parrot or other wild-bird note.<br>
<br>
Page 32. "Heard the report of fire-arms."&mdash;Strange, at some
eighteen days' journey from the coast, where we had never beheld
a Papuan with fire-arms.<br>
<br>
Page 39. "Deer and Moolah."&mdash;The "Basilisk", though on the
look-out for traces of sport, never, saw a sign of such animals,
nor of some others mentioned through the book.<br>
<br>
Page 53. "Mount Misty rises to a height of 10,672 feet", and two
other peaks near it respectively to "12,580 feet", and
"12,945."&mdash;These mountains, by Captain Lawson's map, appear
to be but ninety miles from the coast, and it is difficult to
understand how they could have remained unseen by the officers of
H.M.S. "Basilisk", or those of H.M.S. "Fly", in 1845, who were
within 100 miles of them, with a flat, low country, and (in our
case) a clear atmosphere between.<br>
<br>
Page 61. "An old man . . . smoking a long Dutch pipe."&mdash;The
people of our acquaintance used the large bamboo pipe only, from
which each man of a party takes a whiff and passes it on.<br>
<br>
Page 62. "Fights and murders were frequent . . . traders landed
and burnt the Papuan villages."&mdash;The only murder that has
ever taken place here within my knowledge was that of three
native teachers, placed by the London Missionary Society on
Bampton Island, about fifteen miles from the position Captain
Lawson assigns to Houtree.<br>
<br>
Page 63. A native (Taa) is said to possess "a hundred head of
cattle."&mdash;If cattle had been known by Australian traders to
exist so near Cape York, the Jardine Brothers would have been
aware, and not have undertaken the expense and risk of driving a
herd of cattle from Brisbane to Cape York, a distance of 1000
miles, through an unknown country, full of hostile natives.<br>
<br>
Page 70. "Natives sold into slavery to the Dutch, who transport
them to their settlement."&mdash;I have visited the Dutch
settlements in the east, but have failed to observe any form of
slavery.<br>
<br>
Page 72. "The women and children take their meals after the men
have finished."&mdash;In our experience they always ate together,
and we regarded it as one sign of their good treatment of the
women.<br>
<br>
Page 78. "It (a scorpion) had stung him through the linen
breeches he wore."&mdash;I know not how to conceive of a Papuan
wearing "linen breeches", and again, the sting of the scorpion is
here spoken of as producing certain death, a statement opposed to
all experience.<br>
<br>
Pages 101 and 102. The trap-door spider is here mentioned as
seen, enormous in size and poisonous in bite. This kind of spider
is common enough in Jamaica, but was never seen by us here. Now
we were frequently engaged in cutting wood for fuel to a gross
amount of 600 or 700 tons, and were brought into the closest and,
at times, most distressing contact with insect life. We
recognised several varieties of spider, and it seems singular
that this remarkable one should have escaped our notice.<br>
<br>
Page 205. Natives on the river are here stated to possess
"daggers . . . curved swords, pikes, and flint muskets . . .
horse pistols 100 years old."&mdash;How came such arms to be
amongst savages 200 miles inland, when none are to be seen on the
coast.<br>
<br>
Page 209. "The sea, he (a chief) said, could easily be reached by
water in a day and a half or two days . . . he had never seen a
European before, nor a black man, but had heard of both. Malay
and Chinese vessels frequented the northern coast to
trade."&mdash;From this statement, coupled with Captain Lawson's
map and account, he must have been somewhere near Astrolobe Gulf.
In this part of the country the eminent Russian traveller, Mr.
Macklay, spent eighteen months, and on my meeting him at Amboyna,
in June 1874, he gave me an account of the natives, which, more
or less, has since been published in Europe, showing that the
natives of north-east New Guinea are wholly savage and destitute
of fire-arms, and have no communication whatever with Chinese,
Dutch, or Malay races, and this account accords with our
observations in the "Basilisk".<br>
<br>
Page 236. "There are no distinct tribes in New Guinea."&mdash;All
our experience goes to prove that distinct tribes do exist.<br>
<br>
Page 273. "Nine Malay and two Chinese vessels in the Bay of
Houtree."&mdash;Captain Lawson says he reached Houtree, on his
return from the interior, February 1873, at which time the boats
of the "Basilisk" were from ten to twenty miles from the given
position of Houtree, and the "Basilisk" herself was at Warrior
Island, not forty miles distant. Certainly then no Malay or
Chinese vessel was near Houtree.<br>
<br>
Page 278. "There are certain parts of the coast, especially the
east coast, which have no villages or fixed inhabitants, and
these places are the favourite harbours of refuge for the pirates
and robbers who infest the eastern seas."&mdash;We found villages
and fixed inhabitants everywhere on the east coast, and we are at
a loss to know what pirates or robbers Captain Lawson refers
to.<br>
<br>
Page 280. "Gold and silver, the latter common . . . copper, lead,
iron, tin, abundant."&mdash;Not a sign of any of these metals,
excepting gold, was ever seen by the "Basilisk".<br>
<br>
Captain Lawson states that he left Houtree on the 24th of
February, in a Chinese junk of forty or fifty tons, and reached
Banda on the 1st of March, making thus a distance of about 1000
miles in five days, and this during the prevalence of the
north-west monsoon. This, to my mind, is almost the most
surprising statement in the book.<br>
<br>
<p>Page 282. "Granted permission to reside in Banda until I could
obtain a passage in a Dutch vessel."&mdash;Why wait for a Dutch
vessel when a regular line of mail steamers runs monthly between
Banda, Batavia, and Singapore? Neither is it now necessary for an
Englishman to "ask permission" to reside in Banda, so long as he
conducts himself within the laws.</p>
