<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<br>
<p>The exploits of <small>SIR JOHN FRANKLIN</small> are written
so large across the map of the Arctic Ocean and its coasts; the
circumstances of his tragic end have rendered his name and
achievements familiar to so many Englishmen not otherwise
specially conversant with the subject of Polar exploration; the
story of his voyages and discoveries has so often been related as
a part of the general history of English adventure, that the
appearance of this biography, nearly half a century after his
death, may seem to require a few explanatory words.</p>
<p>It has been felt by his surviving relatives, as it was felt by
his devoted wife and widow, that to the records, ample and
appreciative as many of them have been, of the career of the
explorer there needed the addition of some personal memoir of the
man. What Franklin <i>did</i> may be sufficiently well known to
his countrymen already. What he <i>was</i>&mdash;how kindly and
affectionate, how modest and magnanimous, how loyal in his
friendships, how faithful in his allegiance to duty, how deeply
and unaffectedly religious&mdash;has never been and never could
be known to any but his intimates. But that knowledge ought not
to be confined to them. The character of such men as Franklin is,
in truth, as much a national possession as their fame and work.
Its influence may be as potent and its example as inspiring; and
it has been felt by those responsible for the production of this
volume that some attempt should at last be made to present it to
his fellow-countrymen.</p>
<p>It was the long-cherished desire of Miss Sophia Cracroft,
niece of Sir John Franklin, and constant and attached companion
of Lady Franklin, to perform this labour of love herself, and it
supplied the animating motive of her unwearied industry in
collecting the mass of documents hitherto unpublished which have
been employed in the preparation of this work. Failing health and
almost total loss of sight, however, prevented the accomplishment
of her purpose, and eventually her executors, Mr. and Mrs. G. B.
Austen Lefroy, have entrusted the work to the present writer.</p>
<p>Both to them and to him it is a source of much satisfaction
that this Biography should issue from the house of Mr. John
Murray, whose father was the publisher of Franklin's two
Narratives of his Arctic Explorations and the personal friend of
their author and Lady Franklin, and who has himself taken a warm
interest in the present undertaking.</p>
<p>In dealing with Franklin's achievements as an explorer ample
assistance was accessible to me in already published works. The
story of his first two Arctic expeditions&mdash;the former a tale
of unexampled toil and sufferings heroically endured&mdash;has
been told with admirable clearness, simplicity, and modesty by
Franklin himself. In 1860, after the return of the Fox from her
famous and successful voyage, the late Admiral Sherard Osborn,
himself an active and distinguished member of one of the earlier
search expeditions, published a little volume of a hundred pages,
entitled 'The Career, Last Voyage, and Fate of Franklin',
containing a condensed but masterly sketch of his hero's earlier
discoveries and a most graphic and moving description of his last
ill-starred adventure. The particulars of Sir Leopold
McClintock's search for and discovery of the sole extant record
of the crews of the Erebus and Terror have been gathered from
that gallant officer's painfully interesting narrative of his
voyage. But still more important and indeed invaluable help has
been derived by me from the able and exhaustive monograph on
Franklin contributed to the 'World's Great Explorers' series by
Admiral A. H. Markham, himself an Arctic officer of distinction,
whose ready kindness, moreover, in advising me on an obscure
point in the history of Franklin's closing hours and in perusing
the proofs of the chapters dealing with his last expedition I
desire most gratefully to acknowledge.</p>
<p>Nor can I close this record of my obligations without
expressing my thanks to Miss Jessie Lefroy for such a lightening
of my labours by the methodical arrangement of documents as only
those who have suffered from the lack of such assistance in
examining and digesting voluminous masses of manuscript material
can fully appreciate.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p align="center">EARLY YEARS AFLOAT<br>
<br>
1786-1807</p>
<p><small>THE</small> name of Franklin has none of that obscurity
of origin which sometimes perplexes a biographer at the very
threshold of his work. Its blood and history unmistakably
proclaim themselves. The 'franklin' was the old English
freeholder&mdash;the man who held direct of the Crown, and was
frank, or free from any services to a feudal lord. He was, in
fact, the original type of the small independent country squire,
and so continued to be until, at any rate, the time of Chaucer,
whose delightful description of the 'Frankeleyn' pilgrim in the
Prologue to the 'Canterbury Tales' distinctly stamps him as of
this rank. By Shakespeare's day, however, it is clear that his
status had somewhat declined. More than one reference to a
'franklin' and a 'franklin's wife' in the Shakespearian drama
shows clearly enough that the word no longer designated any one
of sufficient importance to have it written of him that 'at
sessions ther was he lord and sire;' still less that 'ful ofte
tyme he was knight of the schire.' We may take it as certain, in
fact, that before the Elizabethan period the title of 'franklin'
had become identified with the order of well-to-do substantial
yeomen; and though by that time of course the process of
converting the description of men's rank or calling into their
surnames had long since completed itself, there were in
continuing existence, no doubt, many English families whose
surname still represented their status. There were still
Franklins by name who had originally been franklins by position.
The famous American statesman and natural philosopher claimed
descent from 'a family which had been settled for four centuries
at Ecton, in Northamptonshire'; and it was from this same sturdy
order of Englishmen, for many an age the pillar of the country's
prosperity in peace and its right arm in war, that John Franklin,
the famous Arctic explorer, sprang.</p>
<p>The family had been East Anglian from as far back as it was
possible to trace it. A sister of John Franklin's, who had been
at pains to investigate its history, states that her forbears
came originally from the county of Norfolk. Her inquiries were
not successful enough to enable her to fix the period of
migration, but there is evidence dating from the early years of
the eighteenth century that the family was at that time settled
at Sibsey, near Boston, in Lincolnshire, on an estate which had
even then been in their possession for several generations. The
wealthier yeomanry of those flourishing times took rank almost as
a small local squirearchy, whose members were not always among
the most provident of men; and at least two generations of the
Sibsey Franklins seem to have lived up to this position with an
only too dramatic success. The family tradition, at any rate, is,
that John Franklin, the grandfather of the explorer, following
paternal example, so greatly reduced the ancestral patrimony as
to leave little more at his death than 'a moderate subsistence
for his widow'; and, forced to rebuild their fortunes, the
Franklins passed, as many a good English house has done before
and since, from the ranks of the country gentry into those of
trade. John Franklin's widow, 'a woman', writes one of her
descendants, 'of masculine capacity and great resolution of
character', rose to the occasion. She apprenticed her eldest son
Willingham to a grocer and draper in Lincoln, and as soon as he
was out of his indentures removed with him to the market town of
Spilsby, where she opened a little shop, and, 'not content with
acting as housekeeper for her son, superintended the business in
every department which admitted of female supervision with the
utmost activity and success.' Thanks to her assistance and to his
own energy, Willingham prospered in his trade, added to it in due
time a banking business, married the daughter of a substantial
farmer in 1773, and, six years later, had accumulated sufficient
capital to acquire the freehold of his house and shop in the
town, and to purchase a small property a few miles off as a place
of retreat for his old age. It was in the house at Spilsby, on
April 15, 1786, that John Franklin first saw the light.</p>
<p>He was the fifth and youngest son and the ninth child of a
patriarchal family of twelve. The second and third of his four
elder brothers (the fourth died in infancy) rose, like himself,
to distinction in the public service. Willingham Franklin, the
second son, who was seven years John's senior, was sent to
Westminster and Oxford, becoming scholar of Corpus, and
afterwards Fellow of Oriel. He was called to the Bar from the
Inner Temple, and was in 1822 appointed Puisne Judge of the
Supreme Court at Madras, where, two years later, his career was
prematurely cut short by cholera. James Franklin, the third son,
entered the East India Company's service as a cadet in 1805,
served with credit in the Pindari war, and singled himself out as
an officer of considerable scientific attainments. He was
employed on important Indian surveys, and after his retirement
from the service was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He
died in 1834 at the age of fifty-one.</p>
<p>Of Franklin's seven sisters, two died unmarried: one of them
in comparatively early years, the other, Miss Elizabeth Franklin,
at an advanced age. Of the five married sisters, two also died
before attaining their thirtieth year. Sarah Franklin, the
younger of them, had become the wife of Mr. Selwood, and was the
mother of the two ladies who married two brothers of a name
destined to become illustrious throughout the English-speaking
world, and the younger of whom still survives as the Dowager Lady
Tennyson, widow of the late Poet Laureate.</p>
<p>A third sister, Hannah, married Mr. John Booth, and their
daughter Mary became the wife of Franklin's staunch comrade and
friend, Sir John Richardson.</p>
<p>It was, perhaps, with his sister Isabella, the sixth daughter
of the family, that John Franklin was the most closely linked in
after life. She married Mr. Thomas Robert Cracroft, and it is to
the pious labours of her daughter Miss Sophia Cracroft, seconding
and prolonging those of Lady Franklin, whose devoted friend and
lifelong companion she was, that I am indebted for the copious
materials on which this memoir is based.</p>
<p>Henrietta, the youngest daughter, married the Rev. Richard
Wright, and died some ten years ago in extreme old age, leaving a
son, the present Canon Wright, Rector of Coningsby,
Lincolnshire.</p>
<p>The early life of a boy with half a dozen elder brothers and
sisters is in most families much the same. He becomes the fag of
the one, the pet of the other, and by turns the pride and the
plague of their common parents. In John Franklin's case the
fagging may have been remitted; but there is distinct evidence of
the petting, which, moreover, was no doubt encouraged and
justified by the fact that, like many children destined to a
vigorous manhood, he was a singularly weak and ailing infant,
whose prospect of being reared at all was during the first two or
three years of his life considered extremely doubtful. Though
undoubtedly of an affectionate and generally docile disposition,
John, his brother-in-law Mr. Booth records, was 'not noted, like
his brothers and sisters, for neatness and orderliness;' and the
combination of this not uncommon failing with a certain harmless
propensity&mdash;which indeed may even have been the germ of a
virtue&mdash;led to unpleasant consequences. It was, in fact, the
cause of at least one incident which was without precedent in the
family, and which is spoken of even in the records of a later
generation almost with bated breath. On the landing of the
staircase in the house at Spilsby, as probably in many a similar
spot in many another English household of that Spartan age, there
hung a whip; 'but such was the dutiful obedience at all times
paid by the children to their parents' that from an instrument of
correction it had declined into a mere emblem of authority. It
was reserved, however, for the future explorer to show that, like
the sword of the magistrate, it was not borne in vain. Opposite
to the Franklins' house stood that of the Rev. Mr. Walls, the
owner of Boothby Hall, a gentleman of 'ample private fortune', at
whose door the carriages of callers were constantly to be seen.
Upon the youngest son of the Franklin family the sight of these
arriving and departing visitors exercised an irresistible
fascination. Naturally, however, his parents, having regard to
that unfortunate want of 'neatness and orderliness' above
mentioned, were unwilling to exhibit John as a sample of the
Franklin household, and he was 'strictly forbidden to go over the
way and stare at this daily spectacle.' But the child 'seemed
utterly incapable of putting a curb on his curiosity.' The
conclusion of the painful story is almost visible already. A boy
of untidy appearance, intensely interested in the fashionable
arrivals at the house of a neighbour, and, in defiance of
parental injunctions, determined to assist at them: we have here
the plot of a domestic tragedy ready made. After repeated
commands, repeatedly disobeyed, the emblem of authority became
once more an instrument of correction; the whip which hung on the
landing was taken down&mdash;and used. But, 'though the boy was
in no way rebellious on any other point, neither entreaty nor
whipping could prevent his punctual attendance at the opposite
door whenever a carriage drew up.' It was not exactly the
explorer's thirst for discovery, yet perhaps it may have had its
latent affinities with that passion. It was certainly gratified
with all an explorer's determination. With his mind intently
directed towards his childish object, and his will resolutely
bent on attaining it, it seems clear that John Franklin accepted
his punishment as a mere unpleasant incident of the enterprise,
an experience to be submitted to and disregarded, like the Polar
cold, or the winter darkness of the Arctic Circle.</p>
<p>But, indeed, there is evidence enough that he was a lad full
of adventurous aspirations. There was almost as much of earnest
as of jest in the endeavour to outdo the projects of his
playfellows, which an anecdote of his boyish years records. The
family story goes that, after each of them had specified the
particular feat of strength or heroism which he intended to
perform on attaining manhood, nothing less ambitious would
satisfy young Franklin than the construction of a ladder whereby
to 'climb up to heaven.' Gravitation and statical laws were
possibly recognised even then as obstacles; but obstacles only
existed to be overcome.</p>
<p>To a lad possessed by so early and extravagant a longing to do
battle with the forces of Nature, it is a critical moment when he
is first confronted with that mighty adversary in its most
impressive and defiant form. The turning-point of his career is
usually reached on the day when he receives his first challenge
from the sea.</p>
<p>To Franklin it was not long in coming. At the age of ten, he
was sent to school at St. Ives, whence he was shortly afterwards
transferred to that nursery of Lincolnshire worthies, at which
Charles and Alfred Tennyson were many years after also educated,
the Grammar School at Louth; and one day, during his earlier time
at this school, he started off with a playmate to pay his first
visit to the coast. His native town of Spilsby, though but a few
miles inland, had no connections, by trade or otherwise, with any
East Anglian port, and there had been nothing therefore in his
surroundings to inspire him with curiosity as to maritime matters
or with interest in a seafaring life. But that drop of brine
which is in the blood of every Englishman, and which has driven
many a youth from the very heart of the Midlands to make his
lifelong home upon the ocean, must have stirred in young
Franklin's veins. Setting out from Louth one holiday with this
young companion, he made his way to Saltfleet, a little
watering-place some ten miles off, and there looked for the first
time on that world of waters on which he was to play so memorable
a part.</p>
<p>That one look was enough. The boy returned home as irrevocably
vowed to a sailor's life as though he had been dedicated by some
rite of antiquity to the god of the Sea. His father&mdash;like
nine English fathers out of ten&mdash;objected. That curious
spirit of parental resistance to what ever has been, and, it is
to be hoped, ever will be, the natural and irresistible vocation
of so many thousands of English sons, was strong within him. John
was his youngest&mdash;how often it is the youngest!&mdash;the
Benjamin of the flock; and it would be a hard matter to part with
him, for all his 'want of neatness' and his undue curiosity about
the visitors over the way.</p>
<p>Mr. Franklin's attitude, in fact, towards his son's maritime
aspirations was simply that adopted before and no doubt since his
time by innumerable British fathers similarly situated. It seems
only to have differed from the traditional paternal posture in
that it was taken up with more intensity of conviction and
maintained with more persistency than in the average case. Not
many a father, that is to say, would go so far perhaps as to
declare, with the elder Franklin, that 'he would rather follow
his son to the grave than to the sea;' though many, no doubt,
have resorted to the means adopted by him for testing the reality
and seriousness of the boy's inclinations. John, after all, was
but twelve years old. How many lads of that age, especially
during the school term&mdash;a very important point&mdash;had
been seized with what they imagined to be a passion for a
seafaring life, but what was in reality only a distaste for the
restraints of the class-room or a want of sympathy with the
usher! Mr. Franklin accordingly had recourse to a test which
fathers in like case have not infrequently applied, with, from
their own point of view, complete success. After two years'
resistance to his son's importunities he sent him for a cruise on
board a merchantman trading between Hull and Lisbon, no doubt in
the expectation that from that most efficient of hospitals for
the treatment of the sea-fever from which John was supposed to be
suffering, he would be able to report himself as 'discharged
cured'. But, so far from yielding to this rough remedy&mdash;even
rougher in those days than in these&mdash;the malady became more
acute. The boy returned from his voyage confirmed in his longing
for a sailor's life; and, this fact once ascertained, Mr.
Franklin, like a wise man, gave way. A berth was soon obtained
for him as a 'first-class volunteer' on board the Polyphemus,
Captain Lawford, and in the autumn of 1800 his eldest brother
Thomas was sent up to London with him to procure his outfit and
see him off. Duties of this kind are not always dear to the heart
of an elder brother, and when he is a young man of twenty-seven,
actively engaged in business, and full, as was the case here, of
grave business anxieties, some little impatience with the delays
of his mission is perhaps excusable. This, at any rate, seems the
probable explanation of Thomas's curious proposal to 'place John
at school' while awaiting the return of the Polyphemus, then
engaged in 'demonstrating' off Elsinore, to Yarmouth Roads. 'I
fear', he writes to his father, 'that it will be impossible for
me to save Monday'&mdash;that is, to return by that day. 'If it
is possible I shall do it, for never was I so tired of doing
nothing, yet continually running after this nasty cloaths-buying
business, which to-morrow I shall compleat.' Still, he speaks
with a proper fraternal pride of the result of his labours, and
admits that 'the dirk and cocked hat, which are certainly very
formidable, are among the most attractive parts of his
dress.'</p>
<p>It was not till the end of October that the Polyphemus arrived
in port, and that Mr. Allenby, the friend with whom John had been
placed in London, was able to tell his father, 'I have just seen
your delightful boy off in the Yarmouth coach, inside; paid all
for him and gave him ten pounds in his pocket. This I thought
necessary, as he has his bedding, &amp;c, to buy at Yarmouth, and
if he is admitted to a mess with the officers he will have to
subscribe to it' He adds, with what reads like a mild sidelong
rebuke of the impatient Thomas: 'I hope that Mr. T. Franklin is
gone to Yarmouth to meet him. If not, I hope he will go, as he
will not have to attend him again on the same business. In future
I have no doubt but he will fight his own way.' The first letter
written by the lad as an officer in His Majesty's service gave
every indication that he would. For this is the bright, boyish,
spirited fashion in which the young middy writes:&mdash;</p>
<p align="right" class="quote"><small>H.M.S. Polyphemus, Yarmouth
Roads: March 11, 1801.   </small></p>
<blockquote>Dear Parents,&mdash;I take this opportunity to inform
you that we were yesterday put under sailing orders for the
Baltic, and it is expected that we shall certainly sail this
week. It is thought we are going to Elsineur to attempt to take
the castle, but some think we cannot succeed. I think they will
turn their tale when they consider we have thirty-five sail of
the line, exclusive of bombs, frigates, and sloops, and on a
moderate consideration there will be one thousand double-shotted
guns to be fired as a salute to poor Elsineur Castle at first
sight.</blockquote>
<p>Then follows a passage which is interesting as showing that
exploration was more in the boy's thoughts even then than the
excitement of war:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I am afraid I shall not have the felicity of going
out with Captain Flinders [who was preparing a vessel for a
survey of the Australasian coast], for which I am truly sorry, as
we in all probability will be out above four months; but if we do
return before the Investigator sails, I will thank you to use
your interest for me to go. You cannot hesitate asking Captain
Lawford to part with me when you consider the advantages of it.
Look at Samuel Flinders, who has the promise of getting his
commission to go out with his brother. . . .[whereas, in our
present service], if we take any ships or make any prize money,
it will be two years before we receive it, and very little will
fall to my share.<br>
<br>
I will thank you when you write to Anne and Willingham to tell
them of our expedition up the Baltic, by which some of us will
'lose a fin' or 'the number of our mess', which are sailor's
terms.<br>
<br>
I will give you the names of the ships which are going with us,
and of those which remain in Yarmouth under the command of
Admiral Dickson. [Here follows a list of Sir Hyde Parker's fleet]
I think we shall play pretty well among the Russians and Danes if
they go to war with us.<br>
<br>
Please to remember me to my brothers and sisters.</blockquote>
<p align="right" class="quote">I remain your affectionate
son,         <br>
<small>JOHN FRANKLIN</small>.  <br>
<br></p>
<blockquote>Excuse my bad writing, as we expect it is the last
boat. The ships that remain in Yarmouth are the Princess of
Orange, the Texill (54), the Leyden (68), and two or three others
for a guard.<br>
<br>
Remember me to dear Henrietta, and tell her when I get a ship she
shall be my housekeeper. Also to Isabella.</blockquote>
<p>The youthful prophet was right. The 'salute to poor Elsineur
Castle' shook Europe, and echoes through our history to the
present hour. In less than three weeks after these words were
written young Franklin was bearing a part in what the greatest of
our naval heroes pronounced 'the most terrible' of the hundred
battles he had fought.</p>
<p>The British fleet sailed from Yarmouth on March 12, under Sir
Hyde Parker, with Nelson as his second in command, and arrived
off Zealand on the 27th. Entering the Sound, in spite of the
opposition of the Governor of Cronenberg, who, after protesting
against their entrance, opened fire upon them from his batteries
as they sailed through that channel on March 30 with a fair wind
from the N.W., our vessels bore up towards the harbour of
Copenhagen. Menacing indeed was the armament upon which the lad's
eyes rested when, after a four hours' sail up the Sound, the
Polyphemus came to anchor with the rest of the squadron opposite
this famous and formidable port. The garrison of the city
consisted of ten thousand men, with whom was combined a still
stronger force of volunteers. All that was possible had been done
to strengthen the sea-defences, and the array of forts, ramparts,
ships of the line, fireships, gunboats, and floating batteries,
was such as might well have deterred any other assailant but the
hero of the Nile. Six line-of-battle ships and eleven floating
batteries, with a large number of smaller vessels, were moored in
an external line to protect the entrance to a harbour flanked on
either side by two islands, on the smaller of which fifty-six,
and on the larger sixty-eight heavy guns were mounted. Four other
sail of the line were moored within, across the harbour mouth,
while a fort mounting thirty-six powerful pieces of ordnance had
been constructed on a shoal, supported by piles. These were so
disposed that their fire would cross that of the batteries in the
citadel of Copenhagen and on the island of Amager. It seemed
hardly possible that any ships could pass over the centre of the
deadly circle and live.</p>
<p>Nor were these armaments the only obstacles which confronted
the British fleet. The channel, by which alone the harbour could
be approached, was little known and extremely intricate; all the
buoys had been removed, and the sea on either side abounded with
shoals and sandbanks, on which if any of the vessels grounded
they would instantly be torn to pieces by the fire from the
Danish batteries. The Danes themselves considered this particular
barrier insurmountable, and Nelson himself was fully aware of the
difficulty of surmounting it; for a day and a night were
incessantly occupied by the boats of the fleet, under his orders,
in making the necessary soundings and replacing by new buoys
those which had been taken away. Despite these precautions,
however, and despite all that British seamanship could do in the
way of skilled navigation, the harbour shoals proved formidable
antagonists when the actual attack was made on the morning of
April 2. Of the twelve line-of-battle ships which made fearlessly
for the entrance of the harbour, amid the joyous cheers of their
crews, on that memorable day, no fewer than three went aground
and stuck immovable, exposed to the withering fire of the Tre
Kroner batteries and unable to render any effective aid in the
attack.</p>
<p>The Polyphemus was in Nelson's division, and was one of those
which escaped this untoward mishap. The Edgar, under Captain
Murray, led the division, and it was the Agamemnon, the ship
immediately behind her, which was the first to go aground. The
Polyphemus, which had been the last but three of the line, was
signalled to advance out of her turn. Then followed the Monarch,
the Ardent, and other vessels. The two that shared the fate of
the second vessel in the division were the ships which had been
in the immediate rear of Franklin's, the Bellona and the Russell.
Nelson followed in the Elephant, and only saved his vessel and
the remainder of his division by a swiftly conceived and executed
change of course.</p>
<p>Pressing onward, however, with the rest of his force, which
had been warned by the fate of the Agamemnon to alter their
course, and pass inside instead of, as had been intended, outside
the line taken by their leading vessels, the nine remaining
vessels reached their stations, and at forty-five minutes past
ten the action commenced, becoming general by half-past
eleven.</p>
<p>The Polyphemus was soon at it hammer and tongs; and was among
the vessels which, during those four furious hours, had the
hottest work. Here is an extract from her official
log:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>At 10.45 the Danes opened fire upon our leading
ships, which was returned as they led in. We led in at 11.20. We
anchored by the stern abreast of two of the enemy's ships moored
in the channel, the Isis next ahead of us. The force that engaged
us was two ships, one of 74, the other of 64 guns. At half-past
eleven the action became general, and a continual fire was kept
up between us and the enemy's ships and batteries. At noon a very
heavy and constant fire was kept up between us and the enemy, and
this was continued without intermission until forty-five minutes
past two, when the 74 abreast of us ceased firing; but not being
able to discern whether she had struck, our fire was kept up
fifteen minutes longer, when we could perceive their people
making their escape to the shore in boats. We ceased firing and
boarded both ships and took possession of them. Several others
were also taken possession of by the rest of our ships; one blown
up in action, two sunk. Mustered ship's company and found we had
six men killed and twenty-four wounded, and two lower-deck guns
disabled.</blockquote>
<p>Such was the result of the triple duel between the Polyphemus
and the Danish block-ships Wagner and Provestien, assisted by the
Tre Kroner battery. The cannonade all round was tremendous,
nearly two thousand guns on both sides concentrating their fire
upon a space not exceeding a mile and a half in breadth. For
three hours had the engagement continued without showing any
signs of slackening in its firing; when Sir Hyde Parker signalled
to Nelson a permissive order to retire, and there occurred the
often related, but recently questioned,* incident of Nelson's
putting his telescope to his blind eye. Sir Hyde's motive was a
generous one. He had seen with concern the grounding of the three
ships, and their almost helpless exposure to the Danish
cannonade. 'The fire', Southey reports him as saying, 'is too hot
for Nelson; a retreat must be made. I am aware of the
consequences to my own personal reputation, but it would be
cowardly in me to leave Nelson to bear the whole shame of the
failure, if failure it should be deemed.' Doubtless, too, he knew
his man well enough to feel confident that if Nelson saw the
slightest chance of continuing the contest with success&mdash;and
the chance must have been slight indeed which did not satisfy
Nelson&mdash;he would disobey the order. Figuratively in fact, if
not literally speaking, he foresaw the legendary application of
the telescope to the blind eye, and his foresight proved
accurate. Nelson failed to 'see' the signal, and, nailing his own
colours to the mast, prolonged the desperate fight for another
hour, until, the rapidity and precision of the British fire
having at last proved irresistible, the Danish replies began at
two o'clock in the afternoon to abate sensibly in vigour. Ship
after ship struck amid the cheers of our sailors, and before
three the whole force of the six line-of-battle ships and the
eleven floating batteries which had formed the front line of
defence were either taken, sunk, burnt, or otherwise destroyed.
Finally, the resistance of the enemy having now been completely
broken down, Nelson sent proposals for an armistice, which were
accepted, and the attacking squadron drew off to rejoin Sir Hyde
Parker's ships in the centre of the Straits. The loss on board
the British fleet was very severe. It was no less than 1,200
killed and wounded, a larger proportion to the number of seamen
engaged than in any other general action during the whole war. On
the side of the Danes, however, it was much greater, the total
number of killed, wounded, and prisoners amounting to 6,000.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Professor J. K. Laughton's <i>Nelson</i>.
'Men of Action Series.' (Macmillan.)]</p>
<p>The condition indeed of the enemy at the close of the action
presented a heart-rending spectacle. White flags were flying from
every mast that was yet erect, and guns of distress booming from
every hull that was still afloat. The sea was thickly covered
with the floating spars, and lurid with the light of flaming
wrecks. English boats thronged the waters endeavouring to render
all the assistance in their power to their wounded and drowning
enemies, who as fast as they could be rescued were sent ashore;
but great numbers perished. It was not till daybreak on the
following morning that Nelson's flag-ship, the Elephant, which
had gone aground in returning to Sir Hyde Parker's squadron, was
got afloat and the prizes carried off.</p>
<p>Thus ended this murderous battle, one of the most obstinately
contested in the annals of the British Navy. For the boy Franklin
it was a baptism of fire indeed; and even in those days of the
Great War, when Englishmen thought nothing of sending their
children almost from the nursery to the cockpit, the case of this
lad of fifteen who passed with such startling abruptness from the
sleepy peace of a Lincolnshire country town to the thunder and
slaughter of the dreadful day of Copenhagen can hardly have had
many parallels. There could, at any rate, have been no more
dramatically appropriate opening to a life of peril and adventure
destined to be crowned by a tragic death.</p>
<p>The horrors of the scene produced, as well as they might, a
deep impression on young Franklin's mind; and a kinsman records
having been told by him in later years that 'he saw a prodigious
number of the slain at the bottom of the remarkably clear water
of that harbour, men who had perished on both sides in that most
sanguinary action.' But exultation over the victory and pride at
having borne a part in it were, of course, more enduring
sentiments in the young midshipman's mind. He was genuinely
attached to his profession and happy in its pursuit; and even
from the few written records which have been preserved of this
early period of his career one can gather details which shape
themselves into an attractive, if imperfect, picture of the lad.
The weakliness from which, as already mentioned, he had suffered
in his infancy had long since disappeared. Even in his school
days he was remarkable, relates a reminiscent of that time, Mr.
Tennyson d'Eyncourt, 'for his manly figure and bravery', and his
'flowing hair;' and both then and afterwards he appears to have
struck observers by a peculiar earnestness and animation of
countenance. The characteristic which had impressed Mr. Tennyson
d'Eyncourt in the face of the schoolboy is noted, curiously
enough, almost in the same words, by an officer who met him when
on the verge of manhood, and who subsequently testified to the
accuracy of the observation by at once recognising him again
after a lapse of forty years. This witness also speaks of him as
a youth 'with a most animated face'. It was doubtless the
immature and undeveloped form of that fine expression of energy
and daring which distinguishes his later portraits. In other
physical respects, too, the boy appears to have been 'the father
of the man'; for 'the round-faced, round-headed' lad with an
evident tendency to 'put on flesh' who is described elsewhere in
the last-quoted of these accounts might very well ripen into the
portly and full-bodied Franklin of middle age.</p>
<p>His ways and disposition were evidently full of charm. From
many slight but sufficient indications, traceable even in the
scanty reminiscences of this far-off time, one can plainly
discern those winning qualities which afterwards endeared him,
beyond all leaders that one has ever heard of, to his companions
in adventure. There is the same frankness of speech and bearing,
the same open and affectionate disposition, and no doubt, too,
the same hot but generous temper, which in after years made him
at once so quick to resent a slight and so ready to forgive
it.</p>
<p>His fear lest the despatch of the Polyphemus to the Baltic
should make him lose the chance of joining the exploring
expedition to the South Seas proved fortunately groundless. Had
he been too late to join it, the whole course of his career might
have been altered. He might quite possibly have settled down into
the life of the ordinary naval officer and never have acquired
that passion for geographical discovery which afterwards bore
such brilliant fruits. But the hope expressed by him in the
letter above quoted was realised. The Polyphemus was ordered home
with the rest of the Baltic fleet in the summer of 1801; and a
berth was obtained for Franklin on board the Investigator, which
started for the Southern Hemisphere on July 7 of that year. Her
commander, Captain Matthew Flinders, who had married an aunt of
Franklin's, was a sailor of first-rate capacity, and had already
won high distinction as an explorer in the seas to which he had
now been despatched on no less ambitious an enterprise than that
of effecting a survey of the entire seaboard of Australia. There
could have been no better school or schoolmaster for a youth of
John Franklin's bent and aspirations. He was proud of his
commander's achievements, and attached to him both by
relationship and regard. The character of his duties was in many
respects novel, and his voyage, he was aware, would procure him
an amount of training in navigation and practical seamanship
which he could not have acquired with anything like the same
expedition in the regular service of the navy. Of the spirit in
which he entered on his duties we may judge by the following
extract from a letter of Captain Flinders to the elder
Franklin:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>It is with great pleasure that I tell you of the good
conduct of John. He is a very fine youth, and there is every
probability of his doing credit to the Investigator and himself.
Mr. Crossley has begun with him, and in a few months he will be
sufficient of an astronomer to be my right-hand man in that way.
His attention to his duty has gained him the esteem of the first
lieutenant, who scarcely knows how to talk enough in his praise.
He is rated midshipman, and I sincerely hope that an early
opportunity after his time is served will enable me to show the
regard I have for your family and his merit.</blockquote>
<p>By October of 1801 the Investigator had reached the Cape of
Good Hope, and from that station Franklin wrote his father a
letter describing the incidents of the voyage. They had touched
at Madeira on the way out, and the lad's account of that island
and its people abounds in evidences of an observant faculty
beyond his years. Now, as always, he was studying more than the
mere routine of his profession, in the scientific branches of
which, however, he was obviously making good progress. He was,
indeed, acquiring a proficiency for which he did not obtain quite
his fair amount of recognition; for it would seem that Sam
Flinders, his captain's brother was in the habit of entrusting to
him a considerable share of the duty of taking observations
without being equally careful in distributing the credit of the
results. To this 'exploitation' of himself young Franklin thought
it wise to submit, though not without privately recorded
protests; and it is with some natural feelings of resentful
relief that later on he chronicles the fact of Sam's having
exchanged his berth on the Investigator for a post which his
brother had succeeded in obtaining for him on board another
vessel.</p>
<p>The elder Flinders did much, however, to atone for the
unsatisfactory conduct of the younger. He instructed his nephew
pretty steadily in navigation and relieved him when at sea of day
watches, Franklin reports, in order to enable him to attend his
captain 'in working his timepieces, lunars, &amp;c.;' so that, on
the whole, the eager young sailor had no reason to be
dissatisfied with his opportunities of self-improvement. The
example of the fine seaman and enthusiastic explorer under whom
he served must indeed, for a lad of Franklin's ardent
temperament, have been an education in itself. Throughout his
whole life he cherished the warmest admiration for the character
of Matthew Flinders, and in later years he gladly welcomed the
opportunity of paying an enduring tribute to his old commander's
memory in that very region of the world which his discoveries had
done so much to conquer for civilisation.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1802, when, after having surveyed the whole
of the southern coast of the Australian continent from King
George's Sound in Western Australia to Port Jackson, the
Investigator was refitting in that harbour, Franklin wrote his
mother a letter full of that dutiful simplicity of filial
affection which was so marked a feature in his character. 'I take
this opportunity', he says, in the quaintly ceremonious manner of
the time,</p>
<blockquote>of returning my most sincere thanks to my worthy
parents for their care of me in my younger days, for my
education, and lastly for the genteel and expensive outfit for
this long voyage; and if a due application to my duty and anxiety
to push forward in my profession will repay them, they may rely
on it as far as I'm able. ... My father, I trust and hope, is
more easy about the situation in life I have chosen. He sees it
was not either the youthful whim of the moment, or the attractive
uniform, or the hopes of getting rid of school that drew me to
think of it. No! I pictured to myself both the hardships and
pleasures of a sailor's life (even to the extreme) before ever it
was told to me; which I find in a great measure to agree. My mind
was then so steadfastly bent on going to sea, that to settle to
business would be merely impossible. Probably my father, like
many others who are unacquainted with the sea, thinks that
sailors are a careless, swearing, reprobate, and good-for-nothing
set of men. Do not let that idea possess you, or condemn all for
some. Believe me, there are good and bad men sailors. It is
natural for a person who has been living on salt junk for several
months when he gets on shore to swag about. Picture to yourself a
man debarred from all sorts of comfortables such as mutton, beef,
vegetables, wine, and beer. Would he not after that bar was broke
begin with double vigour? But I have said enough on this subject.
A line in answer to this would satisfy me.</blockquote>
<p>Later on in the letter he reverts to a matter which was seldom
absent from his mind&mdash;the necessity of steady endeavour to
perfect himself in his profession:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Thank you for that good and genuine advice in your
letter. . . The first thing which demands immediate attention is
the learning perfectly my duty as an officer and seaman. It would
be an unpardonable shame if after serving two years I was
ignorant of it. The next, the taking and working of astronomical
observations which (thank God!) by the assistance of Captain
Flinders I am now nearly able to do. Then French: many is the
time I have envied the hours spent in play instead of learning.
Now I feel the want of a knowledge of French, for there are two
ships of that nation engaged in discovery here and I'm not able
to converse with them in French, but am obliged to refer to
unfamiliar Latin.</blockquote>
<p>Writing a few months later to his sister Elizabeth, he gives a
detailed account of his reading, interspersed with criticisms,
amusing in their youthful air of profundity, on the subjects of
his study:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The following are the books which I read in my
leisure hours (inform me, do you approve of
them?):&mdash;'Junius's Letters.' What astonishing criticisms!
What a knowledge of the State affairs at that time! But he was at
last mastered by Horne Tooke, who had a right cause to handle.
'Shakespeare's Works.'&mdash;How well must that man have been
acquainted with man and nature! The beautiful sympathetic
speeches he makes them use! Of comedies, the 'Taming of the
Shrew' and the 'Merry Wives of Windsor' are his masterpieces. Of
tragedy, 'Macbeth' and 'King John'. History of Scotland, from the
Encyclopaedia, 'Naval Tactics', 'Roderick Random', 'Peregrine
Pickle', sometimes Pope's Works. And, exclusive of navigation
books and Latin and French, geography sometimes employs a good
deal of my time, as was the request of my brother Thomas in his
last letter.</blockquote>
<p>He winds up with a piece of information most interesting to a
sister&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I am grown very much indeed, and a little thinner, so
that I shall be a spruce and genteel young man, and sail within
three points of the wind, and run nine knots under close-reefed
topsails, which is good sailing&mdash;</blockquote>
<p>and also admirably well adapted to bewilder the female mind,
as was no doubt its intention, with its shower of unfamiliar
nautical expressions.</p>
<p>The pursuit of literature, however, could only have been the
occupation of a not very abundant leisure; for it is certain that
Franklin was kept pretty fully employed during his stay at Sydney
in assisting to promote the scientific objects of the voyage. An
observatory was set up on shore, to which all the chronometers
were removed, and where all the necessary observations were
taken. It was placed under the charge of Samuel Flinders, to whom
Franklin was attached as assistant; and his services in that
capacity were thought at least sufficiently worthy of recognition
by the local authorities to have earned for him the humorous
appellation of 'Mr Tycho Brah&eacute;' from Governor King, then
presiding over the colony of New South Wales.</p>
<p>A few days after the letter last quoted was written, the
vessel resumed its voyage, which, however, was destined to be cut
short by unforeseen causes before its object was fully attained.
Unfortunately, it turned out that the scientific curiosity of the
Admiralty had not, like charity, begun at home. Before
commissioning the Investigator to survey the coast of New Holland
it would have been better to more carefully survey the
Investigator. After rounding the north-east point of the
continent and entering the Gulf of Carpentaria, the extensive
coast-line of which was examined and duly delineated on the
chart, the old vessel began to 'exhibit unmistakable signs of
decay'; and it was discovered on examination that her timbers
were in so rotten a condition that it was not considered likely
that she would hold together in ordinary weather for more than
six months, while in the event of her being caught in a gale she
would in all probability founder. Her commander, it is true, was
not unprepared for this discovery. Evidence of her general
unseaworthiness had come to light, indeed, before she had reached
Madeira on her outward voyage; but, as Captain Flinders
characteristically put it, he had been 'given to understand that
the exigencies of the Navy were such that no better ship could be
spared from the service, and his anxiety to complete the
investigation of the coasts of Terra Australis did not admit of
his refusing the one offered.' Admirable, however, as is the
spirit of a naval officer whose ardour in adventure will not
permit him to decline the offer of a rotten ship if a sound one
is not to be had, one cannot feel equally impressed with the
conduct of naval authorities who send him out in such a vessel to
explore the entire seaboard of Australia, with an injunction 'not
to return to England until that work is satisfactorily
accomplished.' As it was, Captain Flinders had all his work cut
out for him to return, not to England, but to Sydney, which port
he succeeded in reaching in June 1803, after an anxious and
perilous voyage round the west coast of Australia. At Sydney the
Investigator was again examined, and the experts by whom she was
examined having reported her 'not worth repairing in any
country', she was ultimately converted into a storehouse hulk,
and it was arranged that Flinders, with a portion of his officers
and crew, should return home in the Porpoise, in order to report
the facts of the case to the Admiralty and endeavour to obtain
another vessel in which to continue the work of Australian
exploration.</p>
<p>The breakdown of the Investigator was, however, but the first
of the series of misadventures which Franklin was destined to
meet with in this his maiden cruise as an explorer. Six days out
of Sydney the Porpoise, making for the newly discovered Torres
Strait with two merchant vessels under its pilotage, struck upon
a reef&mdash;a fate which was shared by one of its
consorts&mdash;the other making off, one regrets to record,
without rendering any assistance. The disaster occurred towards
nightfall, and, the ships fortunately holding together until the
morning, their crews managed to effect a landing, with such of
the provisions and stores of the two vessels as they were able to
save, on a sandbank some nine hundred feet by fifty, about half a
mile from the wreck. Their position here, however, was
sufficiently critical. The nearest known land was two hundred
miles off, and Sydney, the only place from which assistance was
to be hoped for, they had left nearly four times that distance
behind them. It is needless to say that they faced the situation
with the cheerful pluck and resourcefulness of their nation and
calling. Tents were erected with the salvaged sails; a blue
ensign with the union-jack down was hoisted on a tall spar as a
signal of distress; an inventory of stores was taken and found
sufficient to last the ninety-four castaways, if properly
husbanded, for a period of three months. A council of officers
was then called, and it was decided that one of the six-oared
cutters should be despatched to Sydney, under the command of the
indomitable Flinders, to obtain relief. Accordingly, on August
27, accompanied by the commander of the lost merchant ship and
twelve men, and having stored his small boat with provisions and
water for three weeks, that officer set out on his doubtful and
hazardous voyage of seven hundred and fifty miles. Week after
week passed, and at length, on October 7, when their stores were
beginning to run low and the castaways were within measurable
distance of the date at which it had been resolved that if no
help came they would themselves make a desperate dash for the
mainland of Australia in two boats which they had constructed out
of materials saved from the wreck, they caught the welcome sight
of a sail. It was Flinders returning from Sydney in the Rolla,
bound for Canton, accompanied by the two Government schooners
Cumberland and Francis. Franklin, with the bulk of the
shipwrecked crew, embarked on board the first-named vessel; his
captain, anxious to get home as soon as possible to report his
discoveries and prepare his charts for publication, preferred to
return to England at once in the Cumberland. It was a fatal
choice. The vessel touched at the Mauritius on its way home, and
there, by one of those many acts of downright brigandage which
disgraced the name of France at the rupture of the Treaty of
Amiens, he was made a prisoner by the French Governor of the
island and detained for no less than six and a half years. He
lived, this much-enduring Ulysses, to return to England and to
write an account of his memorable voyage; but the volume and the
charts accompanying it, which he had lost his liberty in hurrying
home to publish, only issued from the press, by a truly tragic
coincidence, on the very day of his death.</p>
<p>Franklin had gone to Canton in the Rolla to await a
homeward-bound ship, but there were yet further adventures in
store for him before reaching England. A squadron of sixteen
Indiamen was on the point of sailing, under the command of
Commodore Nathaniel Dance, of the H.E.I.C.S.; and the officers
and men of the Investigator were distributed among its vessels,
Franklin's berth falling to him on board the Earl Camden, which
flew the commodore's flag. They carried arms, did these
merchantmen of John Company, as indeed such vessels mostly did in
those troublous times; but their guns, from thirty to thirty-six
in number, were of light calibre, and the gallant vessels relied
rather upon the 'brag' of their appearance than on their real
fighting power; for their hulls were painted in imitation of
line-of-battle ships and frigates, the more easily to deceive the
enemy's cruisers and privateers. They could hardly hope, however,
to escape the attentions of a powerful French squadron by devices
of this kind; and it was with such a squadron that they were
fated to fall in. Its commander, Admiral Linois, was not
otherwise than a brave and capable officer, and the five vessels
under his command, consisting of the Marengo, a line-of-battle
ship of 84 guns, La Belle Poule, 48, two other vessels of 36 and
24 guns respectively, and an eighteen-gun brig under Dutch
colours, were no doubt considerably more than a match in fighting
power for the fleet of Indiamen. Yet this did not prevent the
Admiral and his squadron from getting quite comically the worst
of one of the most singular encounters in the whole of our naval
history. Linois, having received news of the sailing of the
Indiamen from Canton, put to sea at once from Batavia, and came
across his intended captures as they were entering the Straits of
Malacca. Their behaviour, however, was contrary to all maritime
precedent. A witty countryman of the Admiral has in two
often-quoted lines expressed the scandalised astonishment with
which the hunter would naturally regard resistance on the part of
a usually fugitive quarry&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">Cet animal est tr&egrave;s m&eacute;chant:<br>
Lorsqu'on attaque, il se d&eacute;fend&mdash;</p>
<p>and Linois found to his surprise that these particular
merchantmen were animals of just this vicious temper. Instead of
making all sail to escape their pursuers, they formed in order of
battle, and showed every sign of preparing for a regular
engagement. It was late in the afternoon; and the phenomenon was
so perplexing that the French Admiral not unnaturally thought he
might as well take a night to consider it, and decided to
postpone the attack till the following morning. Under cover of
the darkness the English ships might, no doubt, have made their
escape without difficulty, but Commodore Dance had no intention
of thus spoiling so pretty a quarrel. His ships lay to for the
night; and Linois finding them in the same position next day
began to suspect that they must consist partly of men-of-war, and
continued to hold aloof. Thereupon Dance gave orders for his
ships to continue their course under easy sail. The French
Admiral, encouraged by this movement, pressed forward with the
design of cutting off some of the rearward ships. Upon this,
however, the English Commodore instantly faced about, and young
Franklin, who was acting as signal-midshipman, was ordered to run
up the signal: 'Tack in succession, bear down in line ahead, and
engage the enemy.'</p>
<p>Whether in the King's uniform or out of it, Jack in all ages
of our history has asked nothing better; and as quickly as this
man&oelig;uvre could be executed the two squadrons engaged. The
action was short and sharp, if not exactly decisive. After
three-quarters of an hour of it the French ceased firing and drew
off, whereupon the insatiable Dance actually gave the signal for
a 'general chase', and the astonished seas beheld the unique
spectacle of sixteen English merchantmen in hot pursuit of a
French squadron of war. The Commodore gave chase for 'upwards of
two hours', and then, rightly concluding that he had done enough
for honour, recalled his pursuing ships, proceeded on his
homeward course, and duly arrived in England to be rewarded with
a well-merited knighthood. It was one of the most dashing feats
of 'bounce' on record, and deserves to rank with that other and
better known exploit of heroic impudence which has for
generations been celebrated in many a gruff forecastle chorus to
the refrain of the 'Saucy Arethusa'.</p>
<p>How Franklin's services on this occasion were appreciated by
his commander the following extract from a letter, written by Sir
Nathaniel Dance a year later, will show. Addressing Mr. William
Ramsay, an official of the East India Company, he says:</p>
<blockquote>I beg leave to present to the notice of the Hon.
Court, Mr. Franklin and Mr. Olive, midshipmen in His Majesty's
Navy, who were cast away with Lieut. Fowler in the Porpoise, and
who were, as well as that gentleman, passengers for England on
board the Earl Camden. Whatever may have been the merits of
others, theirs in their station were equally conspicuous, and I
should find it difficult in the ship's company to name any one
who for zeal and alacrity of service and for general good conduct
could advance a stronger claim to approbation and
reward.</blockquote>
<p>On August 6 the Earl Camden arrived in the English Channel,
and for the first time after a prolonged interval of enforced
silence the young sailor was able to communicate with his family.
His prolonged cruise had been full of trials and not free from
disaster, but he dwells in his usual mood of cheery contentment
on its compensating gains:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Although mishaps seem to attend every companion of
the voyage&mdash;viz. a rotten ship, being wrecked, the worthy
commander detained, and the great expense of twice fitting
out&mdash;yet do we cheer ourselves with a well-founded idea that
we have gained some knowledge and experience, both professional
and general, even while visiting the dreary and uncultivated
regions of New Holland.</blockquote>
<p>His father had in the meantime retired from business to the
retreat which he had provided for himself many years before, and
thus the son overwhelms him with inquiries:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I have formed many and various conjectures concerning
the Enderby House and enjoyments, and of the residences and
situation of my dear brothers and sisters, particularly of
Willingham, not having heard of or from him since 1801, nor from
Spilsby since June 1802. Sensible of the pleasure the receipt of
letters will afford, particularly from home, I trust some kind
person will not fail answering this by return, and mention how
every member of the family is&mdash;whether any of the Spilsby
friends are dead, whether the old town looks gay, whether you
have received Captain Palmer's account of the Porpoise's wreck,
dated January 10, 1804, and how my old acquaintances in and about
Spilsby are. Some of them have, I expect, paid the debt of
Nature.</blockquote>
<p>A truly characteristic midshipman's account of
information-arrears.</p>
<p>On August 7, 1804, Franklin was discharged from the Earl
Camden, and on the following day he was appointed to H.M.S.
Bellerophon, Captain Loring, which now historic vessel, after a
six weeks' leave spent with his family and friends, he joined on
September 20. And, just as he had left home for the first time to
fight in the great battle of Copenhagen, so now, at the end of
his first short leave of absence, he quitted England to take
part, after only a few months' longer interval, in the still more
memorable struggle of Trafalgar.</p>
<p>The winter of 1804 was spent in blockading the French fleet in
the harbour of Brest, a new experience for Franklin in naval
operations. In April of the following year Captain Loring was
succeeded in the command of the Bellerophon by Captain James
Cooke, whom the midshipman, in that tone of kindly patronage
which not infrequently marks the gun-room's criticism of the
commanding officer, describes to his mother as seeming 'very
gentlemanly and active;' adding, 'I like his appearance much.'
The weary blockade was still continuing, though spring was
ripening into summer; and Franklin, seizing an opportunity at
Cawsand Bay for an 'epistolary conversation with my relatives
previous to our departure to resume this station', goes on to
say:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>We have victualled and stored our ship for six
months, for the purpose of being in perfect preparation to chase
the Brest fleet, should any of them think of moving this summer.
There are twelve sail of us which have fitted for foreign
service; but I believe for no better reason than the above. Some
rumours have sent us out to the West Indies, others off Cadiz,
and some to the East Indies; but certainly without
foundation.</blockquote>
<p>Then his thoughts reverting to his father's newly adopted
country life, the young sailor continues in youth's diverting
vein of didactic reflection:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I trust my father keeps his health and spirits. The
farm at this season of the year must afford him much amusement.
The green fields, the approaching harvest, all tend to gladden
the heart of the farmer, who measures, as it were, every ray of
sun and drop of rain, and is able to tell that this does good and
that harm.</blockquote>
<p>Later on in the letter he adds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The Devonshire fields promise good crops. I hope
Lincolnshire does likewise. Days begin to grow long and the shore
very pleasant. I have been on shore once and enjoyed a long walk.
To us Channel-gropers, believe me, a walk on shore, even in the
detestable borders of the seaport, is charming.</blockquote>
<p>Cadiz proved, after all, to be the destination of the
Bellerophon. She sailed in the summer for that port, and remained
there for some time under Lord Collingwood's orders, when she was
detached with three other ships to convoy the transports and
troops despatched from England to Malta with secret orders,
supposed, as Franklin says, to be 'for landing in Egypt should
Bonaparte endeavour to march any force towards our Indian
settlements.' Returning from this duty, the squadron was ordered
to blockade the port and harbour of Carthagena, wherein lay six
line-of-battle ships which by some accident had been prevented
from joining the combined fleets of France and Spain, then in the
West Indies, with Nelson hunting for them in vain.</p>
<p>Events meanwhile were rapidly working up to the dramatic
climax of Trafalgar. From the same letter, concluded three days
later, Franklin reports the great Admiral's return to Cadiz after
the final abandonment of his West Indian chase; and a little
later Collingwood's command was taken over from him by Nelson,
and the British fleet, consisting of twenty-seven sail of the
line and three frigates, was concentrated off the Spanish coast.
Yet another month, and on the ever-memorable October 21 it closed
with those of France and Spain in that tremendous conflict which
was to shatter Napoleon's hopes of conquest and leave the British
flag supreme on every sea.</p>
<p>The Bellerophon, as all the world knows, was in the thick of
the battle, and Franklin, again appointed to the post of signal
midshipman, was in the hottest of the fire that swept her decks.
The following account of one of the most dramatic incidents of
the action was afterwards given by him to his brother-in-law, Mr.
Booth:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Very early in the engagement the Bellerophon's masts
became entangled with and caught fast hold of a French
line-of-battle ship [apparently L'Aigle]. Though the masts were
pretty close together at the top, there was a space between them
below, but not so great as to prevent the French sailors from
trying to board the Bellerophon. In the attempt their hands
received severe blows, as they laid hold of the side of the ship,
from whatever the English sailors could lay their hands on. In
this way hundreds of Frenchmen fell between the ships and were
drowned. While the Bellerophon was fastened to the enemy on one
side, another French man-of-war was at liberty to turn round and
fire first one broadside and then another into the English ship.
In consequence 300 men were killed on board the Bellerophon. At
last, after a very sharp contest, the French ship which was at
liberty received such a severe handling that she veered about and
sailed away; but still a desultory yet destructive warfare was
carried on between the two entangled ships, until out of
forty-seven men upon the quarter-deck, of whom Franklin was one,
all were either killed or wounded but seven. Towards the end of
the action only a very few guns could be fired on either of the
ships, the sailors were so disabled. But there remained a man in
the foretop of the enemy's ship, wearing a cocked hat, who had
during the engagement taken off with his rifle several of the
officers and men. [It was a shot from one of these sharpshooters
in the rigging of the Redoutable, it will be remembered, that
struck Nelson down.] Franklin was standing close by, and speaking
to a midshipman, his most esteemed friend, when the fellow above
shot him and he fell dead at his comrade's feet. Soon after,
Franklin and a sergeant of Marines were carrying down a black
seaman to have his wounds dressed, when a ball from the rifleman
entered his breast and killed the poor fellow as they carried him
along. Franklin said to the sergeant, 'He'll have you next;' but
the sergeant swore he should not, and said that he would go below
to a quarter of the ship from which he could command the French
rifleman, and would never cease firing at him till he had killed
him. As Franklin was going back on the deck, keeping his eye on
the rifleman, he saw the fellow lift his rifle to his shoulder
and aim at him; but with an elasticity very common in his family
he bounded behind a mast. Rapid as the movement was, the ball
from the rifle entered the deck of the ship a few feet behind
him. Meantime, so few guns were being discharged that he could
hear the sergeant firing away with his musket from below, and,
looking out from behind the mast, he saw the rifleman, whose
features he vowed he should never forget so long as he lived,
fall over headforemost into the sea. Upon the sergeant coming up,
he asked him how many times he fired: 'I killed him', said the
sergeant, 'at the seventh shot.'</blockquote>
<p>Franklin himself escaped without a wound. Throughout the
greater part of the fight he had been stationed on the poop, and
he was one out of only four or five in that quarter of the ship
who emerged unscathed from the struggle. But even upon him it
left its mark in an injury invisible indeed but not unfelt.
'After Trafalgar,' says one of his relatives, 'he was always a
little deaf.' To the last day of his life he bore about with him
this troublesome reminder of that furious cannonade.</p>
<p>The Bellerophon returned to England in December of 1805,
Franklin carrying with him a certificate from Lieutenant Cumby,
who had succeeded to Captain Cooke's command when that gallant
officer fell, to the effect that he had performed the duties of
signal-midshipman 'with very conspicuous zeal and ability.' His
stay in England, however, was destined to be only a short one.
The Bellerophon remained at Plymouth no longer than was necessary
to refit, and make good the injuries sustained in the action;
after which she put to sea again, and for the next eighteen
months was employed in cruising between Finisterre and Ushant.
Franklin's connection with the famous vessel was soon to come to
an end. On October 27, 1807, he begins a letter to one of his
sisters with the remark that she will probably be surprised at
the new address from which he writes. Two days before he had been
drafted from the Bellerophon on to the Bedford, 'commanded by
Captain Walker, a smart, active officer, and the ship, I judge,
will be a fine ship. Report says she is going foreign, but it
must receive some authentication before I can believe it. Indeed,
I hope she may.'</p>
<p>His hopes were realised; but the foreign service on which he
was despatched turned out to be in disappointing contrast with
the exciting experiences of the recent past. He could hardly
expect, however, that these would be indefinitely prolonged. The
pace, indeed, had been too good to last; and there could not have
been many midshipmen in His Majesty's service who had, even in
those stirring times, come in for so large a share of adventure
in so short a period as had fallen to the lot of John Franklin.
It was but six years since he had entered the Navy, a lad of
fifteen, and before completing his twenty-first year he had smelt
powder in two of the greatest naval battles of our history,
explored a continent, suffered shipwreck, and played his part in
one of the most singular and, in its almost comical way, most
brilliant exploits in the annals of our maritime warfare. Thus
his courage and fighting quality had been splendidly tested; he
had had his training in seamanship on half the waters of the
globe; he had learnt energy and resource in the stern school of
disaster; and he had had admirable opportunities for studying
navigation and the scientific branches of his profession in
general under one of the most capable and painstaking of
commanding officers. Fortune had favoured him with many
advantages, but to have made the most of them was his own merit.
His passionate love of his calling had never abated, and his
ambition to perfect himself in all its duties had never flagged.
There is no doubt that, thanks in part to his favouring stars,
but still more to his own great gifts as a seaman, he had even at
this early period of his career already qualified himself for a
position of command. By the time he attained his majority he was
'fit to go anywhere and do anything.' But the good luck which had
hitherto attended him was now about to bid him adieu for some
time to come. Some years were to pass before he again escaped
from the dull routine of duty into the field of warlike
adventure, and yet a good many more years before he found his way
to that special sphere of maritime enterprise in which his true
vocation lay.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p align="center">SERVICE IN TWO HEMISPHERES<br>
<br>
1807-1815</p>
<p><small>IN</small> the concluding chapter of Southey's 'Life of
Nelson' the author of that classic biography, by way of
illustrating the fame of his hero and the confidence reposed in
him by his countrymen, ventures upon the daring hyperbole that
'the destruction of the French and Spanish fleets, and the total
prostration of the maritime schemes of Napoleon, hardly appeared
to add to our security or strength, for, while Nelson was living
to watch the combined squadrons of the enemy, we felt ourselves
secure as now, when they were no longer in existence.' Still,
after all, 'stone dead hath no fellow', and we can hardly doubt
that the annihilation of the French fleet, saddened though our
glorious victory was by the death of Nelson, was generally
regarded by the English nation as preferable to any other
arrangement.</p>
<p>The only class among them who might conceivably have preferred
a less complete triumph were the officers of the British Navy.
For the last quarter of a century, with few and brief
intermissions, they had been as well supplied with opportunities
for the practical study of their profession, both in seamanship
and in fighting, as any sailors could desire. But Nelson had made
such a 'clean job' of it at Trafalgar as to cut off the main
source of these opportunities at a stroke. By sweeping the
enemies of Great Britain off the face of the sea he left her
defenders for many years to come without any efficient training
school in naval warfare.</p>
<p>It was Franklin's good fortune to have joined the British Navy
in time to share its last five years of glorious activity; had he
entered it in 1806 instead of 1801, he would have been condemned
to commence, as he was now to continue, his career by undergoing
as long or a longer spell of uneventful and monotonous duty. The
record of his service afloat from the end of 1807 to the
beginning of 1813 is in effect the history of a continuous
patrol. The first mission of the Bedford after Franklin joined
her as master's mate&mdash;a rank, however, from which he was
promoted in a couple of months to that of acting
lieutenant&mdash;was to convoy the fugitive royal family of
Portugal, driven from Lisbon by the French invasion, to Rio
Janeiro, and for no less than two years the vessel remained
stationed in South American waters. She returned to England in
the summer of 1810, but for only a very brief period, for the
unlucky Walcheren expedition was on foot, and for the next two
years she was employed in the not much more exciting duty of
blockading Flushing and the entrance of the Texel.</p>
<p>During this period, therefore, the external and public side of
the young sailor's life claims but little of a biographer's
attention, which may be devoted mainly to such details of his
private history and domestic relations as serve to illustrate his
personal character. To the Franklin family circle the years which
we are now approaching were far from being unmarked by important
events. One at least of these events had all the memorable
qualities of disaster. Early in the century the commercial
affairs of the bank in which Thomas Franklin had embarked much of
his own capital, and in which a good deal of his father's savings
were also invested, took an unfortunate turn. Thomas became
involved in business transactions with one Walker, whose honesty
seems to have been open to something more than suspicion; and the
consequent pecuniary difficulties in which he found himself
entangled led ultimately to the failure of the Spilsby Bank. The
shock of this calamity brought the son to the grave in 1807 at
the early age of thirty-four, besides hastening the death of his
mother a few years later; and it communicated itself in a
sufficiently perceptible fashion even to John himself overseas.
During the twelve or thirteen years of embarrassment due to these
misfortunes, Franklin received no money whatever from home. His
scanty pay was all he had to subsist on, and his position in such
circumstances must have been one of no little difficulty and
discomfort. But the adversity of the family only served to bring
into stronger relief the fine qualities of the youngest son. His
letters of this period are full of cheerful courage, and testify
throughout to a deep filial affection, which was further
illustrated in the touching little incident, recorded by his
brother-in-law, of his laboriously saving the sum of 5<i>l</i>.
out of his midshipman's pittance and remitting it to his parents
as his mite of relief to their embarrassed finances.</p>
<p>Most tiresome, perhaps, of all the duties of this monotonous
period were those of the squadron detailed to dance attendance
upon the exiled Prince Regent of Portugal and his Court. They
were as dull as the man&oelig;uvres of a blockade, without any of
its sustaining hopes of a possible engagement. In a letter to his
sister from the Bedford, cruising off Rio Janeiro, in December
1808, one sees how eagerly he caught at any piece of political
news from home which might seem to promise an earlier close of
his distasteful commission:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>By a corvette from Lisbon despatched purposely to the
Prince we learn that the capitulation entered into by General
Dalrymple [the Convention of Cintra] is done away, and that a
considerable number of the French army are prisoners. This, we
hope, may excite the Prince to a desire of return, an event we
all anticipate. There, again, I think I hear you say: 'Sailors
are always dissatisfied: for instance, my brother and his
companions, when living in one of the most luxuriant countries
under heaven's canopy, where the least exertion in husbandry or
agriculture is overpaid by superabundant return, and whose very
bowels contain the richest mines of gold and silver.' This remark
as to the characteristic of sailors may be true, yet I assure you
in this case it is excusable in those obliged to remain among
perhaps the most ungrateful inhabitants of the earth, for whom it
is impossible to have the slightest esteem or respect, subject to
their bigotry, and observers of their lethargy and indecision,
with the greater considerations of a dear, expensive market, and
unhealthy crowded towns.</blockquote>
<p>Still, there were occasional diversions, and one such
adventure of Franklin's on the island of Madeira, whither he had
been sent to reclaim two deserters from the Bedford who had been
captured by the Portuguese authorities, is so well and
graphically told by him in his despatch to his commanding
officer, Captain Mackenzie, that the amusing story had best be
given in his own words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>In obedience to your directions (he writes) I herein
state the conduct of Sergeant Joachim Francisco Uram&atilde;o,
who had possession of the two deserters from H.M.S. Bedford, whom
you sent me to claim on the 25th August, 1809.<br>
<br>
After leaving the ship with the person who gave the information
of these men being taken, I went to the captain of the regiment
by whom the informer was despatched, and begged he would give
orders that the men might be delivered to me. He sent a guide
with the necessary instructions for the sergeant, whom [the
guide] we took on the boat and proceeded to the spot.<br>
<br>
Immediately on entering the village we saw the deserters,
apparently unguarded. One was assisting in thatching the
sergeant's house, the other drunk. I inquired for the sergeant,
but it was some time before I saw him, and then he was just
rising from his bed, and drunk also. I desired my interpreter to
say those men had deserted from the Bedford, that I was a
lieutenant of the ship, and sent to claim them by my captain,
having also got the necessary orders for their discharge from his
captain. He arose, and very insolently told me I could not have
them, that he had an order from his colonel to take them on
board, as well as a letter from Captain Mackenzie, and that he
meant to carry them the next day. Seeing the facility there was
for their escaping in the night, I pointed out that I had full
power to give any receipt he wished, and that, having come far
from the ship, I did not wish to return without the men. He then
grew more violent, and said: 'Your commander may command his ship
but not the shore', still persisting in not giving them up to me.
Finding all remonstrance vain on my part, I begged the guide to
repeat the orders he had received from his captain respecting the
release of the two men, and at that repetition he waxed furious,
and told him he did not care for the captain, that he ought not
to have acquainted the English of the two men being in his
possession, and that he would put both the captain and the guide
to death.</blockquote>
<p>(Sergeant Joachim Francesco Uram&atilde;o must evidently have
been very drunk indeed.)</p>
<blockquote>After these expressions I thought it necessary to
remind the sergeant that I should inform you of his conduct, and
was assured of your forwarding the complaint to his superiors. He
then cooled down, and promised to let the men go if I would
permit him to accompany them. This being my original intention, I
of course assented. He prepared himself, and ordered a canoe to
follow him. That, I suppose, was about three o'clock. He
afterwards went to another part of the village and stayed a
considerable time. Being far distant from the ship, and night
coming on, I became impatient, and requested his companions would
hasten him and point out the necessity of our going immediately.
After two or three messages he returned, and positively refused
either to let the men go or accompany them himself, using the
strange language that 'the English did not command there, and
that he did not care for his captain', &amp;c, which was
expressed with such gestures as greatly to irritate my feelings
as well as those of the men whom I had ordered up. I desired the
interpreter to request that he would give me a decisive answer
whether he meant to release the men to me or not, and also
impress again on his mind that I was fully empowered to give a
receipt, and at the same time to assure him of my firm
determination to acquaint you with every circumstance.<br>
<br>
After this explanation he resigned the deserters up to me (by the
advice of many of his neighbours), under the idea of accompanying
them. On our passage over the hill he told me that I might take
him to the Prince, but that he did not care for that. The Prince
did not pay him, and he was under no obligation to serve him,
with many other incoherent expressions, which I did not attend
to. I took him in the boat and left him with the captain, whom I
called on to acknowledge the receipt of the men. I beg leave to
mention that this happened in the presence of Mr. St. Quintin,
and of some men whom I took over the hill to guard the prisoners
back, and they can testify to the prisoners' violent
conduct.</blockquote>
<p>As a specimen of quiet tenacity combined with judgment,
temper, and self-command, the successful taming of this
intoxicated Portuguese sergeant must be admitted to be a pretty
creditable performance for a young naval officer of
two-and-twenty.</p>
<p>The records, however, of these tedious years of patrol-work
abound in evidences of Franklin's impatience with the life of
inaction to which he was condemned. With the despatch of the
Bedford on the Walcheren expedition he was visited by a delusive
gleam of hope; and his letters from the Texel throughout the
twenty-four months of the blockade bear amusing witness to his
eagerness to come to blows. Surely, surely the enemy must be
'spoiling for a fight' as much as himself. 'Our fleet consists of
fifteen of the line, but two are kept off the mouth of the Texel,
and two are always in the Downs; the enemy have seventeen in
readiness and two more about to join. It is generally supposed
they will push for Brest. Surely such a force will not be kept
stationary and useless in the Scheldt.' No, they would come out
and give their enemy a chance at them. But then again occurs the
depressing thought that there is yet a third possibility. They
might come out only to give the blockaders the slip and sneak
away. 'I fear they will wait for longer nights, and, by taking
advantage'&mdash;a mean advantage Franklin evidently thinks
it&mdash;'of a stiff breeze, run along shore and give us a
running chase, and perhaps avoid a general action. However, let
us hope for the best and wait with patience.'</p>
<p>This virtue, as we all know, was not rewarded. The inactivity
of the French naval commanders at sea was as masterly as that
displayed, according to the famous epigram, by Lord Chatham and
Sir Richard Strahan on land; and long before his two years of
blockading duty had expired Franklin had probably given up all
hopes of coming to close quarters with the enemy's fleet. In 1812
we find him drawing up memorials of his services for transmission
to the Admiralty, and endeavouring to procure his exchange into
another ship, the frigate Nymphe, with the desire, as he puts it,
of 'seeing the varieties of the service'. His efforts, however,
were in vain; he was fated to remain in the Bedford until the
return of that vessel to England.</p>
<p>With the commencement of 1813, however, a welcome change
occurred. The war with America had broken out, and orders were
received for the Bedford to convoy a fleet of merchant vessels to
the West Indies. This duty discharged, she was given another nine
months' spell of blockading duty off the Texel and Scheveningen;
but in September of 1814 she was again sent with a convoy to the
West Indies, whence she was ordered to New Orleans to assist in
the operations about to be undertaken against the Americans. The
attack on New Orleans had been decided on, and Franklin,
doubtless to his great delight, was one of the party sent out to
execute the preliminary operation of clearing Lake Borgne of the
American gunboats which had assembled there in force for the
protection of the port.</p>
<p>The operations of our military forces before New Orleans are
not among the most brilliantly successful exploits of the British
arms; but the part played therein by the naval contingent can be
recalled perhaps with less dissatisfaction than any others of
their incidents. This is especially true of the attack delivered
upon the gunboats at Lake Borgne, which, whatever may be thought
of it from the strategical point of view, was certainly executed
with a dash and determination highly creditable to the arm to
which it was entrusted.</p>
<p>But a word or two should first be said on the strategical
position of New Orleans itself, a port and town in which, for
reasons best known to our commanders, we gave ourselves about as
hard a nut to crack as could have been picked up anywhere along
the whole eastern seaboard of North America. The first of the
causes which contributed to its safety from attack was the
shallowness of the river at its mouth and the extreme rapidity of
its current. After flowing on in a vast sheet of water varying in
depth from one hundred to thirty fathoms, the Mississippi
divides, before entering the Gulf of Mexico, into four or five
mouths, the most considerable of which is, or was in those days,
obstructed by a sandbank continually liable to shift. Over this
bank no vessel drawing more than seventeen feet of water could
pass; once across, there was no longer any difficulty in
floating, but it was dangerous to anchor on account of the huge
logs which were constantly carried down the stream, some on its
surface, others sunken, and borne along by the undercurrent
within a few feet of the bottom.</p>
<p>In addition to these formidable natural obstacles to invasion,
the mouth of the river was defended by a fort which, from its
position, might well have been deemed impregnable. It was built
upon an artificial causeway, and surrounded on all sides by
impassable swamps extending on either bank of the river to a
place called the <i>D&eacute;tour des Anglais</i> some twenty
miles from the city. Here two other forts were erected, one on
each bank, and, like that at the river's mouth, encircled by a
marsh traversable for the garrison only by a single narrow path
from the firm ground beyond. If, therefore, an enemy should
contrive to pass both the bar and the first fort, he would
inevitably be stopped here; to land being impossible because of
the nature of the ground, and further ascent of the river being
prevented by its here taking so sharp a curve that vessels were
in those days compelled to await a change of wind before they
could make any further way. Moreover, from <i>D&eacute;tour des
Anglais</i> onward to the city the ground, though broken here and
there to some extent by arable land, was still swampy, and, even
where there was foothold, containing no broken ground or any
other cover for military movements.</p>
<p>To attack New Orleans, then, from the river was out of the
question, and the only mode of approaching it was by way of the
lake, or rather gulf, for it was a salt-water inlet, which deeply
indented the shore to the east of the Mississippi mouths. Even
this mode of assault, however, had its difficulties. The shores
of the lake were themselves so swampy as hardly to supply footing
for infantry, far less for the disembarkation and transport of
artillery. To effect a landing it would be necessary for an
attacking force to avail itself of the creeks or bayous which run
up from the lake towards the city, but of these there were not
more than one or two that could be so used. The Bayou of St. John
was one, but was too well defended; another, the Bayou Calatan,
was afterwards actually employed for the purpose. The idea of the
British commander was to effect a landing somewhere on the bank
of the lake after a rapid and, it was hoped, an unperceived
transit of its waters, and thence to push on and seize the town
before any effectual preparation could be made for its defence.
With this view the troops were transferred from the larger into
the lighter vessels, and these, under convoy of such gun-brigs as
the shallow water would float, began on December 13, 1814, to
enter Lake Borgne. They had not proceeded far, however, before it
became apparent that the Americans were aware of their intentions
and were fully prepared to meet the attack. Five large cutters,
armed with six heavy guns each, were seen at anchor in the
distance, and, as all endeavours to land till these were captured
or driven away would have been useless, the transports and the
largest of the gun-brigs cast anchor, while the smaller craft
gave chase to the enemy. The American cutters, however, were
specially built for operations on the lake, and quickly 'got the
heels' of their pursuers, whose draught of water rendered
effective pursuit impossible. Yet to leave these pests to hover
round the British force in a position to cut off any boats which
attempted to cross the lake would have been fatal. It was,
therefore, determined to capture them at all costs, and, since
our lightest craft could not float where they sailed, a flotilla
of launches and ships' barges was got ready for the purpose. It
consisted of fifty open boats manned with a force of one thousand
officers and men, and most of them armed with carronades. The
command of this force was given to Captain Nicholas Lockyer, and
Lieutenant Franklin probably led a division or subdivision of the
attack. About noon of December 13, writes a chronicler of the
campaign, the late venerable Chaplain-General of the Forces and
well-known author of 'The Subaltern', the Rev. G. R. Gleig, who
was himself attached to the British expeditionary force before
New Orleans, and therefore describes the scene with almost the
authority of an eye-witness, Captain Lockyer came in sight of the
enemy moored fore and aft, with their broadsides pointing towards
him.</p>
<blockquote>Having pulled a considerable distance, he resolved to
refresh his men before hurrying them into action; and, therefore,
letting fall grapplings just beyond reach of the enemy's guns,
the crews of the different boats coolly ate their dinners. As
soon as that meal was finished and an hour spent in resting, the
boats again got ready to advance. But unfortunately a light
breeze which had hitherto favoured them now ceased to blow, and
they were accordingly compelled to make way only with the oars.
The tide also ran strong against them, at once increasing their
labour and retarding their progress; but all these difficulties
appeared trifling to British sailors, and, giving a hearty cheer,
they moved steadily onward in one extended line.<br>
<br>
It was not long before the enemy's guns opened upon them, and a
tremendous shower of balls saluted their approach. Some boats
were sunk, others disabled, and many men were killed and wounded;
but the rest, pulling with all their might, and occasionally
returning the discharges from their carronades, succeeded after
an hour's labour in closing with the Americans. The Marines now
began a deadly discharge of musketry; while the seamen, sword in
hand, sprang up the vessels' sides in spite of all opposition,
and, sabreing every man that stood in the way, hauled down the
American ensign and hoisted the British flag in its place.<br>
<br>
One cutter, however, which bore the commodore's broad pennant,
was not so easily subdued. Having noted its pre-eminence, Captain
Lockyer directed his own boat against it, and, happening to have
placed himself in one of the lightest and fastest sailing barges
in the flotilla, he found himself alongside of the enemy before
any of the others were near enough to render him the slightest
support. But, nothing dismayed by odds so fearful, the gallant
crew of this small bark, following their leader, instantly leaped
on board the American. A desperate conflict now ensued, in which
Captain Lockyer received several severe wounds; but after
fighting from the bow to the stern, the enemy was at length
overpowered, and, other barges coming up to the assistance of
their commander, the commodore's flag shared the same fate with
the others.</blockquote>
<p>In this warm little affair Franklin was himself wounded; and,
indeed, though the victory was complete and gave the British
forces undisputed command of the lake throughout the rest of the
campaign, it had to be pretty heavily paid for. Three midshipmen
and fourteen men were killed, while the captain, three other
lieutenants besides Franklin, three master's mates, one
lieutenant of Marines, seven midshipmen (two mortally), and
sixty-one men were wounded. The American loss was slight by
comparison. For his share in this action Franklin received a
medal and was honourably mentioned in despatches.</p>
<p>Would that the later operations of this disastrous campaign
had been more worthy of its brilliant beginning, and that its
military chiefs had performed their part with as much skill and
success, instead of only with as much bravery, as their naval
supporters! The expedition against the cutters had carried our
boats many leagues up Lake Borgne. Another day passed before the
crews could get back to their ships, and it was not till the 15th
that the fleet again weighed anchor and stood up the lake. It was
soon found, however, that not even by the lake route was it
possible to carry the troops up to a point at which a landing
could be with any advantage effected. Ship after ship ran
aground; those which still floated became more and more
overloaded with the men transferred to them, till at last even
vessels of the lightest draught stuck fast, and boats of
necessity had to be lowered to carry the troops a distance of
more than thirty miles. The distresses of such a method of
transport were greatly enhanced by an unlucky change of the
weather, heavy rains having set in, and finally, after an
exposure of ten hours in their new and confined transports, each
division was landed at a small uninhabited island in the lake,
where it was determined to collect the whole force preliminary to
its debarkation on the main land. Pine Island, as it was called,
apparently from its growing a few stunted firs near the water's
edge, consisted principally of swamp, with a comparatively small
piece of firm land at one end, on which the troops were
collected. With the exception of alligators, which abounded in
its pools and creeks, it contained no living creatures but
water-fowl, too shy to be shot. It did not even yield fuel
sufficient to supply its wretched tenants with fires.</p>
<p>In these miserable quarters the British army was assembled
without tents, huts, or any sort of shelter from the inclemency
of the weather, which, though rainy in the daytime, became
sharply frosty after sunset, so that the saturated uniforms of
the soldiers were frozen hard at night, an experience naturally
fatal to the negroes attached to the service of the expedition,
who perished in considerable numbers in their sleep. The only
food which could be supplied to the force in the gameless
condition of the island was salt meat and ship biscuit moistened
with a little rum. For Franklin and his comrades these hardships
were in one sense aggravated, if in another sense perhaps
relieved, by the severest physical toil. Night and day boats were
pulling from the fleet to the island and from the island to the
fleet. It was not till the 21st that the last of the troops were
got on shore, and, as there was little time to inquire into
'turns' of labour, many seamen were four or five days continually
at the oar.</p>
<p>On the 22nd General Keane, the commander of the expedition,
reviewed his forces, and formed an advance guard of 1,600 men to
start on the morrow for the mainland. Their destination was Bayou
Calatan, the creek already spoken of, which lay at no less a
distance than eighty miles from Pine Island. Nothing, indeed, is
more surprising or, though it compels admiration, more calculated
to suggest Marshal Canrobert's historic utterance than the
vastness of the space which, with no base to speak of and hardly
any transport worthy of the name, our forces had to cover in this
remarkable expedition before they could even get within striking
distance of the enemy. One cannot but suspect that, however
'magnificent' were these operations considered as feats of human
resource and endurance, they could not possibly be 'war.' As in
the later case, however, which called forth the French general's
criticism, the British soldier and sailor never 'reasoned why.'
There were not boats enough to transport more than one-third of
the army at a time, so that the advance guard had to take its
chance of being attacked in detail and cut off before its
supports could arrive. Chancing this, however, as they were bound
to do, the force started off on the 23rd under a sky of lowering
clouds, soon to descend in torrents of rain, and to be followed
by the usual frost at night; and, after a voyage of some
twenty-four hours, pursued under the exhausting and depressing
conditions to which they had become habituated, they reached the
mouth of Bayou Calatan, where they surprised and easily captured
the small and unsuspicious picket posted there, and by nine
o'clock on the morning of the 24th they at last set foot on the
mainland of America.</p>
<p>Bayou Calatan emerges from the lake about ten miles below New
Orleans; and, as the nature of the ground on which the advance
guard had landed afforded good cover, they naturally proposed to
lie concealed until they could be joined by the remainder of the
force. Encouraged, however, by the reports of deserters who came
in, assuring them that there were not more than five thousand men
under arms throughout the State, among whom not more than twelve
hundred were regular soldiers, and that the whole force was at
present several miles on the opposite side of the town, expecting
an attack on that quarter and apprehending no danger on this,
General Keane resolved to push on into the open. His forces
accordingly made a march of several miles in the direction of New
Orleans, hit off the main road leading to the city, and finally
halted on the neck of land on which it is built, and which at
that point was not more than a mile broad, having a marsh on the
right hand and the Mississippi on the left, with the New Orleans
road running parallel, and a lofty dyke between river and
highway. Into a more complete death-trap this unlucky advance
guard could hardly have been led. About seven o'clock in the
evening a large schooner stole up the river and opened a deadly
fire of grape upon them from eighteen guns. There is a grim
mixture of the comic and the tragic in Gleig's account of what
followed:</p>
<blockquote>Against this dreadful fire we had nothing whatever to
oppose. The artillery which we had landed was too light to bring
into competition with an adversary so powerful; and, as she had
anchored within a short distance of the opposite bank, no
musketry could reach her with any precision or effect. A few
rockets were discharged, <i>which made a beautiful appearance in
the air</i>; but the rocket is an uncertain weapon, and these
deviated too far from their object to produce even terror among
those against whom they were directed. Under these circumstances,
as nothing could be done aggressively, our sole object was to
shelter the men as much as possible from the iron hail. With this
view they were commanded to leave the campfires and to hasten
under the dyke. Thither all accordingly repaired without much
regard to order and regularity, and, laying ourselves along
wherever we could find room, we listened in painful silence to
the pattering of grape-shot among our huts, and to the shrieks
and groans of those who lay wounded beside them.</blockquote>
<p>Worse still, the attack of the schooner, as they were soon to
discover, was only one part of the enemy's concerted plan. After
lying for almost an hour in this condition, a straggling fire
from their piquets attracted their attention, and, while each man
was speculating as to what these new sounds might portend, they
were 'succeeded by a fearful yell and the heavens were
illuminated on all sides by a semi-circular blaze of
musketry.'</p>
<blockquote>It was now clear that we were surrounded, and that by
a very superior force; and, therefore, no alternative remained
but either to surrender at discretion or to beat back the
assailants. The first of these plans was never for an instant
thought of, and the second was immediately put into force.
Rushing from under the bank, the 85th and 95th flew to support
the piquets; while the 4th, stealing to the rear of the
encampment, formed close column and remained as a reserve. But to
describe this action is altogether out of the question, for it
was such a battle as the annals of modern warfare can hardly
match. All order, all discipline, was lost. Each officer, as he
was able to collect twenty or thirty men round him, advanced into
the middle of the enemy, when it was fought hand to hand, bayonet
to bayonet, and sword to sword, with the tumult and ferocity of
one of Homer's combats.</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, there was no Olympian god to interfere in their
behalf. They had to hold their ground by sheer desperate
fighting, and they succeeded in doing so. The Americans
ultimately drew off, leaving them in possession of the field.
'Our loss, however, was enormous. Not less than 500 men (nearly a
third of the force) had fallen, many of whom were our finest
soldiers and best officers, and yet we could not but consider
ourselves fortunate in escaping from the toils even at the
expense of so great a sacrifice.' That the toils which it
required so great a sacrifice to escape from need never have been
entered at all is, of course, but too unhappily evident. On the
arrival of General Keane's supports on the following day with
artillery of sufficient strength, the obnoxious schooner was
attacked and blown up, the river cleared of the enemy, and the
position generally made good; all which, but for the precipitate
forward march of the advanced guard, would certainly have been
accomplished at a far smaller loss than that of 500 men.</p>
<p>With the arrival of the main body came a new commander,
General Sir Edward Pakenham, of Peninsular fame, just despatched
from England to succeed General Ross, who had fallen at
Baltimore, and under his command the army advanced in two columns
to within six miles of New Orleans, where again preparations for
defence had been made. The American army, under General Jackson,
an officer destined both to military and to political celebrity
in the later history of his country, was posted behind an
entrenchment, having the left bank of the Mississippi for its
right extremity and stretching to a dense and impassable forest
on the left. The line was strengthened by a ditch about four feet
deep which ran along its front, and was defended by flank
bastions, which enfiladed its whole extent, and on which a
formidable array of heavy ordnance was placed. On the right bank
of the Mississippi, which is there nearly half a mile broad, a
battery of twenty guns had been constructed.</p>
<p>This formidable line of entrenchments being evidently much too
strong to be carried by a <i>coup de main</i>, several attempts
were made to approach it in strict scientific fashion. But it was
soon found that the enemy's guns were so superior in weight and
numbers that nothing was to be expected from this species of
attack. The position on the right bank of the Mississippi was
evidently the point on which to direct their efforts, but how to
approach it? There was only one way of doing so&mdash;a most
ambitious and laborious method; but those blundering heroes
shrank from nothing. Again the services of the naval arm, to
which they already owed so much, were called in, and the task
committed to them was no less a one than that of cutting through
the entire neck of land from the Bayou Calatan to the river, and
constructing a canal of sufficient width and depth to admit of
boats being brought up from the lake in order to convey an
attacking force across the Mississippi. This Roman work was
executed with a spirit worthy of the legions of Caesar. The men
were divided into four companies, and toiled night and day at
their appointed task. It was not till after a sharp but
indecisive engagement with the enemy on January 1 that the order
was given, and by the 6th the work was completed. A general
attack on the American position was then planned for five o'clock
on the morning of the 8th. Colonel Thornton, with a force of
1,400 men, was to cross the Mississippi during the previous
night, capture the right bank battery, and turn its guns against
the enemy on the other side of the river. In this forlorn
hope&mdash;for the singularly imperfect dispositions of the
adventure almost entitle it to that name&mdash;the young
lieutenant of the Bedford bore a gallant part.</p>
<p>On the night of the 7th, Colonel Thornton, with a force of
1,400 men, moved stealthily down to the bank of the river; but
there were no boats awaiting him. Hour after hour passed before
they came, and only a portion of them arrived at last. The soft
banks of the canal had given way, choking up the channel and
impassably obstructing the passage of the heavier boats. Instead
of a flotilla for 1,400 men, the Colonel found himself provided
with transport for only 350. But what did that matter? Three
hundred and fifty men are not fourteen hundred, but they are
three hundred and fifty. The Colonel had undertaken to cross the
river and carry the enemy's position on the opposite side, and it
was absolutely necessary that this part of the plan should be
carried into execution. Accordingly, dismissing 1,050 of his
force, the Colonel put himself at the head of 250 men of his own
regiment (the 85th), a division of fifty sailors, of whom
Franklin was one, under Captain Rowland Money, and as many
Marines, and crossed the river.</p>
<p>Instead of reaching it, however, at midnight, dawn was already
breaking when, as they set foot on the landing-place, a rocket
soared into the air from the opposite bank and added wings to
their speed. Pakenham had already begun the attack. He had either
not received intelligence of Thornton's enforced delay or had
disregarded it. With an impatience which proved fatal to the
enterprise, he had determined to advance without awaiting the
concert of his comrade on the other shore. Scaling-ladders and
fascines, however, are no less desirable appliances in an attack
on parapeted works than boats for the transit of rivers; and
Pakenham was without the one, as Thornton had been without the
other. The troops actually had to be halted under the enemy's
guns while the scaling-ladders were sent for; but the fire was
soon so terrible that the head of the column, riddled through and
through, fell back in disorder.</p>
<p>The remainder of this shocking&mdash;and splendid&mdash;story
may be told in the words of Alison:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Pakenham, whose buoyant courage ever led him to the
scene of danger, thinking they were now fairly in for it, and
must go on, rode to the front, rallied the troops again, led them
to the slope of the glacis, and was in the act, with his hat off,
of cheering on his followers, when he fell mortally wounded,
pierced at the same moment by two balls. General Gibbs also was
soon struck down. Keane, who led on the reserve, headed by the
93rd, shared the same fate; but that noble regiment, composed
entirely of Sutherland Highlanders, a thousand strong, instead of
being daunted by the carnage, rushed with frantic valour through
the throng, and with such fury pressed the leading files on that,
without either fascines or ladders, they fairly found their way
by mounting upon each other's shoulders into the works. So close
and deadly, however, was the fire of the riflemen when they got
in, that the successful assailants were cut off to a
man.</blockquote>
<p>At last, General Lambert, to whom the death of Pakenham and
the disablement of Gibbs and Keane had transferred the command,
finding that it was impossible to carry the work and that the
slaughter was tremendous, drew off the remnant of his shattered
troops.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the attack on the right bank battery had been
brilliantly successful. The enemy on that side outnumbered
Thornton's force by three to one and was strongly entrenched. The
assailants had not a single piece of artillery nor any means but
such as Nature provided of scaling the rampart; but they prepared
without a moment's hesitation for an assault. The 85th extended
its files across the entire line of the enemy, the Marines formed
in rear of the centre as a reserve, and at the sound of the bugle
Money's little band of sailors rushed forward with a shout upon
the guns. For an instant they wavered under the heavy discharge
of grape and canister which met them, but, recovering themselves,
they pushed on, and, the 85th dashing forward to their aid, the
whole force swept into and over the works like a wave. The
Americans broke and fled, leaving the British in possession of
their tents and of their eighteen pieces of artillery. Just at
the moment, however, when they were about to turn these guns
against the enemy, news reached them of the repulse of Pakenham's
attack, and with it the disappointing order to abandon a captured
position which Lambert's forces were not strong enough to hold.
Deeply dispirited, we may imagine, by these evil tidings, the
winners of this barren victory rejoined their defeated comrades
on the opposite bank of the river. The whole force retreated on
the night of the 18th, and in another ten days they were
re-embarked.</p>
<p>Franklin's share in this sharp engagement, in which his
commander, Captain Money, was desperately wounded, though he
himself escaped without a scratch, was an important addition to
the young officer's list of services, and he was in consequence
of it recommended officially and very warmly, though in the
result, as will be seen, ineffectually, for promotion. The
Bedford, which does not seem to have taken part in the subsequent
and more successful operations against Fort Boyer, near Mobile,
in February 1815, set sail for home in March of that year, and
reached Spithead on May 30. She was paid off on July 5 following,
and, though Franklin had served on board of her uninterruptedly
for five years, he was reappointed to another ship two days
afterwards. He joined the Forth as first lieutenant, under
Captain Sir William Bolton, and remained until she also was paid
off in the following September; the only incident worth recording
of this short period of service being the employment of the
vessel to convey the Duchesse d'Angoul&ecirc;me to France on her
return to her native country at the Restoration.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p align="center">THE DOROTHEA AND THE TRENT<br>
<br>
1815-1818</p>
<p><small>IT</small> is noteworthy, as showing the natural bent
of the born explorer, that during these years of inaction it was
upon maritime discovery rather than naval warfare that Franklin's
mind was fixed. It was not to Copenhagen and Trafalgar, but to
the shores of Australia and the waters of the Southern Ocean,
that his thoughts reverted. His heart was evidently with the
crazy old Investigator, mouldering ingloriously as a storehouse
hulk at Port Jackson, rather than with the Polyphemus and the
Bellerophon, 'twin thunderbolts of war' though they were. He
longed for fresh employment in the work of exploration; yet,
while all his inquiring and adventurous instincts urged him in
this direction, his legitimate professional ambitions acted to
some extent as an opposing influence. The difficulty of his
position is strikingly brought out in an interesting letter,
written in August 1814, in which one sees his shrewd common-sense
almost amusingly at odds with his enthusiasm. He had previously
written to Mr. Robert Brown, who had sailed with him as
naturalist in the Investigator, deploring the fact that Captain
Flinders's narrative of his voyage had not reached the public
till the very day of its author's death, and reflecting in a
somewhat depressed tone on the unlikelihood of any official
recognition being given to the services of the younger officers
under Flinders's command. Mr. Brown had remarked in his reply on
the possibility, and even probability, that another voyage of
discovery would soon be thought of, and had intimated that he
might have an opportunity of suggesting the employment of his
correspondent thereon, 'provided I were certain that you would
have no objection, or rather that you would prefer, to embark
again in this line of the service.' To this Franklin
answers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I am extremely obliged also for your communication
that it is possible another voyage may be thought of, and
particularly grateful for the kindness you have evinced by
requesting my views on the subject of being employed therein. I
have no hesitation in assuring you they are decidedly in favour
of that service; but I should hope, were an offer ever made to
me, it would be accompanied by promotion. To embark on an
expedition of that nature without some grounds for sanguine
expectation, when an absence of five or six years may be
calculated upon, and a total separation from any chance of
improving your interest, is a most serious consideration; and
perhaps on return, with a constitution much shattered, you may
find the patrons and friends of the voyage either removed or
unable to procure you the appointment you have anxiously sought.
These, my dear sir, are objections, you will readily admit, I
think, which ought to have some weight, and even might be used
(without the imputation of being inclined to cavil) as an
argument why they should give me promotion previous to
starting.</blockquote>
<p>In the end, however, disinterested enthusiasm wins.</p>
<blockquote>I will, however, confess these disadvantages would
not discourage me, so interested do I feel in that service; and
could I suppose it probable that a responsible office in such a
voyage would be offered me, I should think it my duty to devote
my greatest attention to those studies which would fit me for the
better performance of it.</blockquote>
<p>Again, it was but a few weeks since he had forwarded to the
Admiralty a statement of his services and testimonials from his
various commanding officers in support of an application for
promotion, and he feared to appear importunate by applying again
so soon.</p>
<p>By December 1814 he had added to these services and
strengthened their resulting claim by his share in the brilliant
dash at the gunboats of New Orleans and in the subsequent attack
on the forts. But in the next year, unfortunately for all young
ambitions in either service, came the Peace of Vienna; and then
to Franklin's renewed application for promotion came the curt
official answer from Lord Melville that, 'having read the
petition of Lieutenant John Franklin', he was sorry he could not
hold out any expectation of his advancement at an early period.
'As the Navy', added the First Lord, 'is now placed on a peace
establishment, all promotion must in consequence cease, excepting
in the few cases that may occur on the foreign stations.'</p>
<p>Neither promotion nor renewal of active service seemed in
prospect, and there was nothing for the young officer but to
submit as patiently as might be to that which his restless spirit
always found it hardest to bear&mdash;inaction. The next three
years were spent principally with members of his family in
Lincolnshire and elsewhere; and though, no doubt, he was
continually on the look-out for any signs of change in the
official horizon, there is no trace among the correspondence of
these years of any renewed application to the Admiralty. The
opportunity which at last came to him, and by which his future
career was practically determined, came, as far as can be
ascertained, unsought.</p>
<p>It is not very easy to discover why at this particular moment
the spirit of Arctic exploration should suddenly have taken
possession of the Ministerial mind. The then Secretary of the
Admiralty, Sir John Barrow, was, it is true, an ardent
geographer, and specially interested in the subject of Polar
research. He had carefully collected all the reports bearing on
its conditions and possibilities, as affected mainly by the state
and situation of the ice in high northern latitudes; and with
this information as a basis he drew up an elaborate scheme for
the exploration of the Arctic regions. This, warmly supported by
the President and Council of the Royal Society, was submitted to
the Lords of the Admiralty, by whom it was also approved. But
many a Secretary might have piped to a Government as
inspiritingly without inducing that Government to dance. The
three years of inaction may have begun to bore even Whitehall
itself; or the favour with which Sir John Barrow's idea was
received by the public may have insensibly influenced the
official mind; or some other unknown or now forgotten impulse may
have been in operation. This only is certain, that an interest in
Arctic discovery, which had slept for nearly half a century in
Ministerial bosoms, suddenly awakened. It was five-and-forty
years since the Racehorse, under Captain Phipps, and the Carcass,
under Commander Lutwidge, bearing the young Horatio Nelson and
his fortunes, set sail from Sheerness with orders to proceed to
the North Pole, or as close to it as ice and other obstructions
would permit, and reached a latitude of 80&deg; 48', returning
three months later in the same year, 1773. And now, in 1818, a
British Government had again made up its mind to another attack
on the same problem, and had even indeed resolved to combine it
with another project. The Admiralty now contemplated the despatch
of two expeditions&mdash;one with the object of endeavouring to
discover a passage round the northern and north-western coasts of
America from the Atlantic to the Pacific; the other for the
purpose of attempting to reach the North Pole. What is more, they
proceeded to give what to the English mind has always seemed the
best, perhaps the only, proof that a man or a Government means
business. Where the private citizen 'backs his opinion' with a
bet, the State is expected to support the undertaking which it
patronises by the offer of a reward.</p>
<p>So many, moreover, of our national enterprises leave their
mark in some form or other on the Statute Book, that the history
of this revival of English interest in Arctic exploration would
not have been complete unless it had included an Act of
Parliament in its records. The recitals of this enactment bear
ample witness to the fact that the impulse which gave birth to it
was no new one in our history. Among the references to past
legislation which are to be found in 58 George III. c. 20, 'An
Act for more effectually discovering the longitude at sea and
encouraging attempts to find a Northern Passage between the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and to approach the Northern Pole',
is one from which it will be seen, to the surprise perhaps of
most people, that the last-mentioned project had engaged the
attention of the Imperial Legislature more than seventy years
before. As far back as 1745 an Act had been passed offering a
reward of 20,000<i>l</i>. to the owner or owners of any ship or
vessel which should first find out and navigate a 'North-West
Passage through Hudson's Straights to the Western and Southern
Oceans of America;' and thirty-one years later 'a sum of
5,000<i>l</i>. was offered to any person who should approach by
sea within one degree of the Northern Pole.'</p>
<p>This last provision was extended in the Act of 1818 by a
clause providing that 'for the encouragement of persons who may
attempt the said passage or approach the Northern Pole, but not
wholly accomplish the same', it should be competent for certain
commissioners appointed under the Act to propose, by memorial to
the King in Council, 'to direct and establish proportionate
rewards to be paid to such person as aforesaid who shall first
accomplish certain proportions of the said Passage or Approach.'
In pursuance of this, a scale of reward was subsequently fixed by
Order in Council according to which any vessel that first
succeeded in reaching the 83rd parallel of latitude would be
entitled to a reward of 1,000<i>l</i>.; double that sum would be
granted for crossing the 85th parallel; 3,000<i>l</i>. to any
vessel that should reach 87&deg; N.; 4,000<i>l</i>. for attaining
the 88th parallel, and 5,000<i>l</i>. for the Pole.</p>
<p>It was apparently regarded in official as well as unofficial
circles as not at all improbable that the largest of these
rewards would be actually earned. Indeed, one cannot resist a
slight feeling of amusement at noting, after a lapse of nearly
eighty years, the tone of easy familiarity with which the
Admiralty of that period spoke of the North Pole&mdash;a tone
which almost recalls the well-known pleasantry about a certain
famous critic's attitude towards the Equator. 'Should you reach
the Pole, your future course must mainly depend', &amp;c. 'If . .
. the weather should prove favourable, you are to remain in the
vicinity of the Pole for a few days, in order to the more
accurately making the observations which it is to be expected
your interesting and unexampled situation may furnish you with.'
Interesting and unexampled indeed! 'On leaving the Pole you will
endeavour', &amp;c. 'Should you, either by passing over or near
the Pole or by any lateral direction, make your way to Behring
Straits, you are', &amp;c. Such are the constantly recurring
phrases of the instructions issued by the Admiralty, and probably
framed by Sir John Barrow himself, for the conduct of this
expedition; and their confident handling of their obscure subject
is to be attributed not only to the imperfect acquaintance even
of the best geographers of that day with the terraqueous
conditions of the Polar regions, but also no doubt to the
glorious belief then prevalent, a survival from the great war,
that there was no exploit under heaven which the British Navy and
its sailors could not perform, in all probability at the first
attempt.</p>
<p>The Admiralty, it must be admitted, set about the work in a
spirit of thoroughness. Though their Lordships spoke familiarly
of the object of their attack, they did not actually expect that
they could, so to speak, stroll into the Arctic citadel at any
point they might choose to select. They deemed it advisable, as
we have seen, to organise two distinct plans of assault and to
approach the stronghold from two different sides. Four vessels
were accordingly prepared for the service, two of which, the
Isabella and the Alexander, under the command respectively of
'Captain Ross and Lieutenant Parry, were to proceed by the
western route through Baffin's Bay; while the other two, the
Dorothea and the Trent, were to take what is called the
Spitzbergen route due northwards. For the command of the second
expedition the Admiralty selected Captain David Buchan, R.N., who
had a short time previously distinguished himself in charge of an
expedition into the interior of Newfoundland. The vessel on which
he hoisted his pennant was the Dorothea, a ship of 370 tons
burden, and Lieutenant Franklin was placed under his orders in
command of the smaller Trent, a brig of 250 tons. Both these
vessels were hired into the service for the occasion, and were
taken into dock, where they were rendered&mdash;or,
unfortunately, supposed to have been rendered&mdash;as strong as
wood and iron could make them. Captain Buchan's instructions were
to make the best of his way into the Spitzbergen seas, and thence
to endeavour to force his ships northward between Spitzbergen and
Greenland. If successful in reaching the Pole&mdash;a contingency
which, in the then state of knowledge as to the condition of the
seas in the highest latitudes, was evidently quite within
official contemplation&mdash;the commander of the expedition was,
if the weather was favourable, to remain, as we have seen, for a
few days in the vicinity of the Pole for the purpose of making
observations. On 'leaving the Pole' they were to shape their
course for Behring Strait, or, if this proved impracticable, to
sail round the north end of Greenland and return home by Baffin's
Bay and Davis Straits. If the Dorothea and the Trent were unable
to reach the Pole, but if it seemed possible, without
accomplishing that feat, to hit off a course affording any
prospect of reaching Behring Strait, Buchan and Franklin were
directed to take it, 'recollecting that, although it is highly
desirable in the interests of science and the extension of
natural knowledge that you should reach the Vole, yet that the
passage between the Atlantic and the Pacific is the main object
of your mission.' And this elaborately framed document goes on to
give minute instructions for the conduct of the two commanders in
the event of their discovering and navigating the North-West
Passage. They are then to make the best of their way to
Kamschatka, call on the Russian Governor for the purpose of
delivering to him duplicates of all the journals and other
documents which the voyage may have produced, for immediate
transmission overland to London, proceed thence to the Sandwich
Islands or New Albion or some other place in the Pacific Ocean to
refit and to refresh their crews, winter there, and in the spring
repass Behring Strait once more, and return home to England by
the way they had come. It is true, a discretion is allowed them
as to the attempt of this last-mentioned feat. They are maturely
to consider and weigh the prudence of making it. 'If your
original passages should be made with facility, and you see
reason to believe that your success was not owing to
circumstances merely accidental or temporary, and that there is a
probability that you may be able, also, to accomplish the passage
back, it would be undoubtedly of great importance that you should
endeavour to make it; but if, on the other hand, it shall have
been attended with circumstances of danger or difficulty so great
as to persuade you that the attempt to return would risk the
safety of the ships and the lives of the crews, you in this case
are to abandon all thought of returning by the northern passage,
and are to make the best of your way homeward 'by Cape Horn.' And
this portion of a tolerably comprehensive, not to say ambitious,
itinerary concludes with certain orders as to concerted action
between the two expeditions of which the cardinal injunction is
to 'fix with Captain Ross, to whom the other expedition is
entrusted, upon a rendezvous in the Pacific.'</p>
<p>One more extract must, however, be made from it by the
quotation of a passage having reference to a contingency which
was in fact realised:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>In the event of any irreparable accident happening to
either of the ships, you are to cause the officers and crew of
the disabled ship to be removed into the other, and with her
singly to proceed in prosecution of the voyage or return to
England according as circumstances shall appear to require.
Should, unfortunately, your own ship be the one disabled, you are
in that case to take command of the Trent; and in the event of
your inability, by sickness or otherwise, to carry these
instructions into execution, you are to transfer them to the
lieutenant next in command, who is hereby required to execute
them in the best manner he can for the attainment of the several
objects in view.</blockquote>
<p>On April 25 the two vessels sailed out of the Thames, after an
experience of the popular feeling in the matter which shows in
how lively a fashion the enterprise had impressed itself on the
public imagination of that day. Thus, writing to Mrs. Cracroft on
April 6, Franklin says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I hope we shall have left the Nore by this day week.
We all go in the highest spirits, and indeed it would be
ungrateful to feel otherwise, encouraged as we have been by the
kind interest and attention of all ranks of society. It would be
quite impossible for me to convey to you the amazing interest our
little squadron has excited. Deptford has been covered with
carriages and the ships with visitors every day since they were
in a state to be seen. Indeed, their coming in such shoals has
greatly retarded our equipment. We have, in fact, moved further
down the river to prevent that general influx, and shall now, I
hope, be enabled to get our ships in tolerable order before
sailing further.</blockquote>
<p>It was not, however, mere vulgar curiosity alone which drew so
many visitors to the Dorothea and Trent.</p>
<blockquote>You would be surprised to hear the number of persons
this voyage has led me to become personally known to, some of
them persons of considerable rank and all men of scientific
eminence. They have most of them submitted some queries to be
solved by us, or suggestions for us to be guided by, and all have
expressed earnest wishes for our success. ... It really seems
quite ridiculous to find myself placed among these parties, when
I consider how little I know of the matters which usually form
the subject of their conversations. At present, however, the bare
circumstance of going to the North Pole is a sufficient passport
anywhere. What a fortunate person must I, therefore consider
myself to be to have it, and thankful indeed to my good friends
who procured it for me! I only hope I may have the opportunity of
evincing my gratitude by an ardent exertion of earnest endeavours
in the cause they have so much at heart.</blockquote>
<p>And the letter concludes, as was Franklin's affectionate wont,
with much kindly and playful talk of his little nieces Sophy and
Isabella:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I hope you will endeavour to keep upon their minds
the remembrance of Uncle John, or rather make them familiar with
my name; and I trust it will not be long ere they may have an
opportunity of becoming familiar with my countenance also; which,
if they see me after it has been reddened and hardened by a Polar
winter, they will not, I think, at the age they will then be,
easily forget.</blockquote>
<p>He then goes on to give a lively description of his Arctic
outfit, which included, we learn, 'a beautiful mask for the face
in the most severe weather and noses for the more mild.'</p>
<p>The only first-hand account of this voyage is contained in a
volume published five-and-twenty years later by Captain Beechey,
who sailed as Franklin's first lieutenant in the Trent. It is a
most spirited narrative of a voyage the interest of which as a
series of maritime adventures considerably exceeded its
scientific results. The Dorothea and Trent failed to get any
nearer to the Pole than between the 80th and 81st parallels of
latitude, at which point their progress was arrested by an
impenetrable barrier of ice; and a subsequent attempt to force a
passage westward, in pursuance no doubt of the alternative plan
prescribed in their instructions, was equally unsuccessful.</p>
<p>But, considered as a record of manifold dangers and
difficulties encountered with unflinching courage and overcome by
brilliant seamanship, the story of their voyage must always hold
a high place in the history of Arctic adventure. The Admiralty,
as it turned out, had made a contribution of its own to the
trials of the voyagers by providing them with one unseaworthy
ship. Even before leaving Lerwick a leak was discovered in the
sides of the Trent, and it was with difficulty that the vessel
was sufficiently patched up to proceed on her journey. Twice were
they beset in the pack, the first time for thirteen days, and the
second for three weeks; and on the former occasion it was
discovered that a workman, of a type better known perhaps in
these days than in those, had also, though with a guilt more
deliberate than that of his superiors, lent a hand to their
destruction. A dockyard shipwright had murderously left out a
bolt in the process of construction and concealed the defect by
smearing the hole with pitch.</p>
<p>This, however, is somewhat to anticipate the history of a
voyage which, short as it was, abounded in incidents. The two
vessels made Magdalena Bay, on the north-west coast of
Spitzbergen&mdash;not without having experienced some very rough
weather on their northward voyage&mdash;by the beginning of June,
and resolved to wait for a few days in order to give time to the
loosened 'pack' of the previous winter to complete the process of
its dispersal. But in the course of the survey and exploration of
the Spitzbergen coast&mdash;an experience which first inspired
Franklin with his henceforth insatiable passion for Arctic
travel&mdash;the commander of the Trent had a narrow escape of
his life, from a danger which the explorers had probably not
included in their calculations before starting. Icebergs they
knew of as a source of Arctic peril, but they had no doubt
mentally contemplated them only as in actual existence and not as
in process of creation; nor had it occurred to them that to
assist at the birth of an iceberg from its mother glacier was so
hazardous an undertaking as they found it. Twice did they witness
this act of Titanic parturition, a picturesque and animated
account of which is given by Captain Beechey in his 'Voyage of
Discovery towards the North Pole':&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>On two occasions we witnessed avalanches on the most
magnificent scale. The first was occasioned by the discharge of a
musket at about half a mile distance from the glacier,
immediately after the report of the gun a noise resembling
thunder was heard in the direction of the iceberg, and in a few
seconds more an immense piece broke away and fell headlong into
the sea. The crew of the launch, supposing themselves to be
beyond the reach of its influence, quietly looked upon the scene,
when presently a sea rose and rolled towards the shore with such
rapidity that the crew had not time to take any precaution, and
the boat was in consequence washed up on the beach and completely
filled by the succeeding wave. As soon as their astonishment had
subsided they examined the boat, and found her so badly stove
that it became necessary to repair her in order to return to the
ship. They had also the curiosity to measure the distance the
boat had been carried by the wave, and found it ninety-six
feet.</blockquote>
<p>On the second occasion they were much nearer the scene of the
convulsion, and might easily have been overwhelmed by the
avalanche in its descent:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Lieutenant Franklin and myself had approached one of
these stupendous walls of ice, and were endeavouring to search
into the innermost recess of a deep cavern that was near the foot
of the glacier, when we heard a report as of a cannon, and,
turning to the quarter whence it proceeded, we perceived an
immense piece of the front of the berg sliding down from a height
of two hundred feet at least into the sea, and dispersing the
water in every direction, accompanied by a loud grinding noise,
and followed by a quantity of water, which, being previously
lodged in the fissures, now made its escape in numberless small
cataracts over the front of the glacier. We kept the boat's head
in the direction of the sea, and thus escaped the disaster which
had befallen the other boat, for the disturbance occasioned by
the plunge of this enormous fragment caused a succession of
rollers, which swept over the surface of the bay, making its
shores resound as it travelled along it, and at a distance of
four miles was so considerable that it became necessary to right
the Dorothea, which was then careening, by immediately releasing
the tackles which confined her.<br>
<br>
The piece that had been disengaged at first wholly disappeared
under water, and nothing was seen but a violent boiling of the
sea and a shooting-up of clouds of spray like that which occurs
at the foot of a great cataract. After a short time, it raised
its head full a hundred feet above the surface, with water
pouring down from all parts of it, and then labouring as if
doubtful which way it should fall over, and, after rocking about
some minutes, it at length became settled.<br>
<br>
We now approached it, and found it nearly a quarter of a mile in
circumference and sixty feet out of the water. Knowing its
specific gravity, and making a fair allowance for its
inequalities, we computed its weight at 421,660
tons.</blockquote>
<p>On June 7 the expedition quitted Magdalena Bay after five
days' stay, but found the ice outside in much the same condition
as when they had left it. They stood along its margin searching
for an opening, but in vain, and soon afterwards they were driven
by the wind into the pack. Here they remained beset for several
days, and in a position at times of no little danger.</p>
<p>On one occasion, the Trent, though she appeared to be so
closely wedged up that it did not seem possible for her to be
moved, was suddenly lifted four feet by an enormous mass of ice
getting under her keel; at another time the fragments of the
crumbling floe were piled up under her bows, to the great danger
of her bowsprit. Nor was the Dorothea in less imminent peril. The
point of a floe came in contact with her side, where it remained
a short time, and then, glancing off, impinged upon the larger
mass of ice to which the vessel was moored. The terrible pressure
to which she had been subjected was then demonstrated by the
rending asunder of the larger mass; while the point of the floe
was broken into fragments, which were speedily heaped up in a
pyramid thirty-five feet in height, upon the very summit of which
there appeared a huge mass bearing the impression of the planks
and bolts of the vessel's bottom. And all this time, while the
roaring of the sea upon the edge of the pack and the stormy sky
showed plainly that it was blowing a gale at sea, 'the ships were
so perfectly becalmed that the vane at the masthead was scarcely
agitated.' The silent tightening of the fearful grasp in which
the vessels were held was the only sign of the elemental war
outside.</p>
<p>The summer being now pretty well advanced, the explorers began
to perceive that if any progress northward was to be made that
year it must be begun at once. Captain Buchan accordingly
resorted to the laborious experiment of dragging the vessels
through the ice wherever the smallest opening was to be found.
Iron hooks having been driven into the ice, large ropes were
attached to them, and by dint of working these with the windlass
and removing obstructions in the channels with the ice-saws, they
succeeded, after several hours of labour, in reaching a tolerably
clear lane of water, where, with the aid of their sails, they ran
a few miles to the northward. The following two days were spent
in the same toilsome work, after which they found, to their cruel
mortification, that they had all the time been contending against
a current flowing from the north so strongly as to carry the pack
in a southward direction at a greater rate of speed than that of
their own northward advance over its surface. At the end of two
long days of toil they found that they were actually eleven or
twelve miles lower in latitude than they had been at the
beginning of the period.</p>
<p>On July 19, Captain Buchan came definitely to the conclusion
that it was vain to attempt further progress to the northward.
The only course open to them was to abandon the endeavour to
reach the Pole, and, regaining the open sea as quickly as
possible, to try a westward course. They were now, however, about
thirty miles distant from the open sea, and it was only after
nine days' incessant labour in warping the ships in the required
direction that they had at last the satisfaction of finding
themselves in clear water, and were able to turn their ships'
heads to the west. But here the gravest peril which they
encountered, and the one which put their courage and the
resources of their seamanship to the severest test, assailed
them. Hardly had they entered on their new course when a furious
gale sprang up, and to escape immediate destruction they were
driven to the unusual and almost desperate expedient of taking
shelter in the pack. One of the largest hemp cables was cut up
into lengths of about thirty feet, and with these pieces,
together with some walrus hides and iron plates, a sort of shield
was constructed round the hull of the ship to protect it against
damage from the huge blocks of ice with which it would have to
come into contact While still a few fathoms from the ice, they
searched with anxiety for a place that was more open than the
general line of the pack, but in vain; all parts appeared to be
equally impenetrable, and to present one unbroken line of
breakers, on which immense pieces of ice were heaving and
subsiding with the waves, and dashing together with a violence
which nothing apparently but a solid body could withstand. To
continue in the stirring words of Beechey's narrative:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>No language, I am convinced, can convey an adequate
idea of the terrific grandeur of the effect now produced by the
collision of the ice and the tempestuous ocean. The sea violently
agitated, and rolling its mountainous waves against an opposing
body, is at all times a sublime and awful sight; but when, in
addition, it encounters immense masses of ice which it has set in
motion with a violence equal to its own, its effect is
prodigiously increased. At one moment it bursts upon these icy
fragments, and buries them many feet beneath the wave, and the
next, as the buoyancy of the depressed body struggles for
reascendency, the water rushes in foaming cataracts over its
edges, while every individual mass, rocking and labouring in its
bed, grinds against and contends with its opponent until one is
either split with the shock or upheaved upon the surface of the
other. Nor is this collision confined to any particular spot; it
is going on as far as the sight can reach; and when from the
convulsive scene below the eye is turned to the extraordinary
appearance of the 'ice blink' in the sky above, where the
unnatural clearness of a calm and silvery atmosphere presents
itself, bounded by a dark, hard line of stormy clouds&mdash;such
as at this moment lowered over our masts, as if to mark the
confines within which the efforts of man would be of no
avail&mdash;the reader may imagine the sensation of awe which
must accompany that of grandeur in the mind of the
beholder.</blockquote>
<p>Then follows a striking piece of testimony to the unshaken
nerve, or, one might better say, to the buoyant bravery of
Franklin, on whom the mere imminence of deadly peril seems always
to have produced an exhilarating effect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>At the instant when we were about to put the strength
of our little vessel in competition with that of the great icy
continent, and when it seemed almost presumption to reckon on the
possibility of her surviving the unequal conflict, it was
gratifying in the extreme to observe in all our crew the greatest
calmness and resolution. If ever the fortitude of seamen was
fairly tried, it was assuredly on this occasion; and I will not
conceal the pride I felt in witnessing the bold and decisive tone
in which the orders were issued by the commander of our little
vessel, and the promptitude and steadiness with which they were
executed by the crew.</blockquote>
<p>A few minutes more and they were within a few yards of the
tossing, jostling herd of icebergs into which they were about to
plunge:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Each person instinctively secured his own hold, and,
with his eyes fixed upon the masts, awaited in breathless anxiety
the moment of concussion. It soon arrived; the brig, cutting her
way through the light ice, came in violent contact with the main
body. In an instant we all lost our footing, the masts bent with
the impetus, and the cracking timbers from below bespoke a
pressure which was calculated to awaken our serious
apprehensions. The vessel staggered under the shock, and for a
moment seemed to recoil; but the next wave, curling up under her
counter, drove her about her own length within the margin of the
ice, where she gave one roll, and was immediately thrown
broadside to the wind by the succeeding wave, which beat
furiously against her stern, and brought her lee side in contact
with the main body, leaving her weather side exposed at the same
time to a piece of ice about twice her own dimensions. . . .
Literally tossed from piece to piece, we had nothing left but
patiently to abide the issue, for we could scarcely keep our
feet, much less render any assistance to the vessel. The motion
was so great that the ship's bell, which in the heaviest gale of
wind had never struck by itself, now tolled so continually that
it was ordered to be muffled, for the purpose of escaping the
unpleasant association it was calculated to produce.</blockquote>
<p>By dint of crowding on more sail, Franklin succeeded in
forcing the Trent further into the pack, where its masses of ice
were less violently agitated, and in a few hours the gale
subsided. Open water was reached on the following morning, and
the two vessels, for the Trent's consort had also weathered the
storm, sought refuge in Fair Haven, a bay on the northern shore
of Spitzbergen. Franklin and Buchan then proceeded to examine
their wounded ships. They proved, as might have been expected, to
have sustained fearful injuries in this glacial tournament. The
Trent was much mauled, but the Dorothea was the worse sufferer of
the two. She was indeed so desperately damaged on her port side
that it was a wonder she had been able to keep afloat.</p>
<p>Exploring was obviously at an end for her; it was felt that
she must either at once return to England or be abandoned.
Franklin tried hard to persuade his superior officer that the
Trent was still fit for service, and pleaded earnestly for
permission to pursue their enterprise; but Captain Buchan, no
doubt wisely, declined to listen to his impetuous comrade. His
official instructions, indeed, hardly permitted him to accede to
Franklin's request. These instructions, it may be remembered,
expressly enjoined him, in the event of his own ship being
disabled, to take command of the Trent; but in that case what was
to be done with the Dorothea? Had any 'irreparable accident'
happened to her, it would, it is true, have been his duty to
'cause her officers and crew to be removed' to her companion
vessel, and either to proceed with that vessel 'singly in
prosecution of the voyage, or to return to England as
circumstances should appear to require.' But the Dorothea was not
irreparably damaged; she was perhaps sufficiently seaworthy to
accomplish the return journey to England, though not to face new
dangers in the Arctic seas; and he did not, therefore, feel
justified in abandoning her. If, however, he had taken command of
the Trent and sent his own vessel home in charge of her first
lieutenant, he felt that 'he would incur the appearance of
wishing to escape the danger to which his crew would be exposed.'
Nor, it seems, was he even prepared to take the responsibility of
separating the two ships in order to allow Franklin to continue
the expedition alone in the Trent, the condition of the Dorothea
being, in his opinion, so dangerous as to render it unadvisable
for her to undertake the homeward voyage unaccompanied by her
consort. He finally determined, therefore, that both ships should
desist from the prosecution of their enterprise and return home
together.</p>
<p>There remained only the question whether something more might
not yet be accomplished by a boat journey over the ice; but upon
consulting with Franklin, and examining into the resources of the
ships for such an undertaking, they were found so inadequate that
the project was speedily given up. Captain Buchan was, therefore,
reluctantly compelled to abandon all further attempts at
discovery, and to proceed to England as soon as the necessary
repairs of the Dorothea should be completed. Franklin no less
reluctantly yielded, and, after employing the remainder of their
time at the anchorage in magnetic observations and a thorough
survey of the neighbouring coast of Spitzbergen, the commanders
of the Dorothea and Trent put to sea on August 30, and arrived at
Deptford on October 22, after an absence of almost exactly six
months.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p align="center">FIRST ARCTIC EXPEDITION<br>
<br>
1818-1821</p>
<p><small>IT</small> is difficult for us of the present
age&mdash;an age which has, so to speak, grown almost
<i>blas&eacute;</i> of Polar exploration, and which has moreover
seen even this romantic form of adventure partially vulgarised by
association with the tactics of the advertiser&mdash;to realise
the admiring interest which Arctic voyages aroused in the minds
of our countrymen of the early nineteenth century. Nor is it easy
to frame any adequate conception of the strength of that spell
which they cast over the adventurous spirits of the British Navy,
restless as they were with the excitements, and fired rather than
satiated with the triumphs, of a long and glorious war. The
Arctic Ocean had for some of them taken the place of the Spanish
Main for the sailors of Elizabeth, and the Pole seemed to them
like that fabled El Dorado that so bewitched the contemporaries
of Drake and Raleigh. To Franklin, exploration had always
appealed more powerfully than even war itself, and the
stimulating yet not wholly satisfactory experiences of his voyage
with Buchan had inflamed his passion for Arctic discovery to a
still higher pitch of ardour. It was with intense satisfaction
that he now found even the chilly atmosphere of the Admiralty
warming gradually to the work. The reports of the leaders of the
two expeditions were considered and discussed in official
quarters, and ere long it was decided by the Government to
continue the work of exploration to the westward by Baffin's Bay,
while a party was to be sent overland to explore the northern
coast of Arctic America. The command of the former expedition was
entrusted to Lieutenant Parry, who had already seen service as
second in command of the earlier expedition under Captain Ross.
The vessels selected for the service, the Hecla and the Griper,
sailed on May II, 1819, with instructions to proceed up Baffin's
Bay, and to endeavour to reach the Pacific through any channel
that might be discovered to the westward.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image1" id="Image1"></a><img alt=""
src="1301261h-images/Image1.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>MAP to illustrate FRANKLIN'S OVERLAND JOURNEY</small></p>
<br>
<p>The other expedition, which, it will be observed, was an
entirely new departure in point of method, was placed under the
command of Franklin. Its instructions were to proceed by land
from the north-western shore of Hudson's Bay, across the vast
tract of country lying between that bay and the shores of the
Arctic Sea, to a point at or near the mouth of the Coppermine
River. Thence the explorers were to endeavour to make their way
in an easterly direction along the north coast of the continent,
and if possible to effect a junction with Parry as he voyaged
westward from the northern extremity of Baffin's Bay.</p>
<p>It was a service well calculated to kindle Franklin's ready
enthusiasm. The land journey lay through a country in those days
blank upon our maps, save where it was threaded by a couple of
thin lines traced in the previous century&mdash;the routes of
Hearne and Mackenzie, two adventurous servants of the Hudson's
Bay Company, who, one in 1770 and the other in 1789, had
succeeded in making their way across it to the sea. It was along
the route taken or supposed to have been taken by the former of
these pioneers that Franklin was directed to advance; but Hearne
was a very inaccurate observer, and the correctness of his
surveys had been much questioned; some even doubted whether he
had ever reached the sea at all. None knew, in fact, what might
be the difficulties and dangers of the shadowy track that the
expedition was to follow, through what inhospitable regions the
travellers might have to pass on their way to the Arctic Ocean,
or what obstacles might oppose themselves to the progress of the
expedition in the attempt to continue their journey by water when
that ocean was reached. Above all, it was impossible&mdash;as the
event only too terribly showed&mdash;to know how far it would be
found practicable to retrace their steps to their base of
operations or to measure the risk which in the attempt to do so
they would incur of perishing from cold, hunger, and fatigue. The
enterprise, in fact, on which Franklin was then setting out,
though it is nowadays perhaps the least known, was yet
undoubtedly the greatest of his achievements. Its geographical
gains are apt to be forgotten; and in the now well-filled maps of
Arctic America the strip of coast line which he reclaimed from
the region of the unknown by this expedition cuts no very great
figure. Yet is the history of this adventure in reality as much
more glorious than that of many explorations more fruitful in
discoveries of importance, as heroism is more glorious than
material success. For it is a tale of indomitable courage, and of
unflinching endurance, than which none more splendid and
inspiring is to be found in all the long and illustrious record
of the great things done and suffered by the men of our race.</p>
<p>How deeply sensible was Franklin himself of the uncertainty of
its issue, we may judge by the following extract from a letter to
his sister, Mrs. Cracroft, which characteristically reflects the
simple piety of his nature, and that temper of trust in the
Divine guidance and of resignation to the Divine will in which he
entered upon any important undertaking of life. After detailing
the instructions which he had received from the Admiralty, and
estimating his probable period of absence at about two years and
a half, by which time, he thinks, 'we shall either have
ascertained the practicability or impracticability of reaching
northwards', he continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Experience, however, has taught me never to indulge
in too superior hopes either of success or reward; but I will
hope and pray, through the assistance of an Almighty Providence,
that each individual among us may be enabled to do his utmost
with cheerfulness and zeal, having his mind anxiously devoted to
the cause. . . . May that Almighty power protect and guide us,
Who alone can order all things, and doth as seemeth best to His
infinite wisdom! May we trust in Him, and endeavour to do our
utmost! This must be our prayer, and, I trust, will be that of
all our friends.</blockquote>
<p>Franklin's companions on this adventurous expedition were,
fortunately for its prospects, resolute and trusty men, Foremost
among them was Dr. John Richardson, a Navy surgeon and a keen and
well-trained scientific inquirer. Another was George Back, who
himself subsequently rose to fame and honours as an independent
Arctic explorer. He had served with Franklin in the Trent, and
had so well acquitted himself that he was at once selected by his
former commander to accompany him on this new venture. Robert
Hood, destined to a tragic end, was another; and in a lower grade
John Hepburn, an old man-of-war's man, to whose staunch fidelity
and heroic self-sacrifice some members of the expedition were
indebted for the actual preservation of their lives. The plan
which Franklin was commissioned to carry out was of a
comprehensive nature. After reaching Hudson's Bay he was to
travel northward with the object of astronomically determining
the position of all capes, headlands, bays, harbours, and rivers,
and also to sketch the trend of the coast-line of North America
between the eastern extremity of that continent and the mouth of
the Coppermine River, with liberty to select, according to
circumstances, the best route to enable him to reach the shores
of the Arctic Sea in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Whether the departure of this expedition excited as much
popular interest as that of its forerunner in the previous year
we do not learn; but, having regard to the circumstances of its
despatch, and the higher expectations entertained of its result,
the public feeling on the subject is hardly likely to have been
less pronounced. Some enterprising caterer for the amusement of
the metropolis had, it seems, conceived the idea of presenting
the incidents of the previous voyage for the instruction and
entertainment of his fellow-citizens in the form of a
panorama&mdash;an exhibition which Franklin, still embarrassed,
like most of the distinguished men of his time, by a species of
modesty which many of the celebrities of our own day have
successfully overcome, regarded, it is evident, with mixed
feelings. Writing to his sister some six weeks before his
departure, he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The panorama opens for public exhibition this day.
There can have been but few visitors, for it has rained
unceasingly. I have not seen it for some weeks, when it was about
half finished. I do not expect to see it again, since my likeness
is said to be strong. I shall not venture to approach very near
Leicester Square, for fear the passers-by should say, 'There goes
the fellow in the panorama.' I have just learnt that Sir Joseph
Banks has seen it, and approves of it highly.</blockquote>
<p>On May 23, 1819, the expedition set sail from Gravesend in the
Hudson's Bay Company's ship Prince of Wales; but bad weather and
adverse winds rendered their progress slow, and it was not till
June 3 that they reached Stromness, in the Orkney Islands. Here
Franklin endeavoured to engage an adequate crew of boatmen to
assist him in ascending the rivers of the Hudson's Bay Territory;
but owing (he says in a letter to his father from this port) to
'the great demand for them at home, which at this time affords
them full occupation', the recruits whom he was able to obtain
were only four in number.</p>
<p>Here Franklin again reviewed the prospects of his enterprise,
and, as can easily be perceived, with growing doubts of its
feasibility:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I have read a copy of Hearne's original journal. The
details are somewhat similar to his printed book, but given in an
embellished style; and, though I am not prepared to go the length
of some persons and doubt his statements altogether, I yet think
he has left a tolerably wide field for observation, and if we are
so fortunate as to search beyond him, I hope we may add something
to the geography and natural history of that unknown part of the
globe. Though we do not permit ourselves to indulge in sanguine
hopes of success, our fervent prayers, I hope, will be offered up
for the blessing and assistance of an Almighty Parent on our
humble endeavours. From every estimate I can at present form I
think the service in any case will occupy near three years. By
October 1821 I shall calculate on bending my steps homeward; but
long before that period, and indeed by every opportunity that
offers, you may rely on my informing you of our
proceedings.</blockquote>
<p>On the 16th the Prince of Wales again put to sea for what was
to prove its eventful and perilous voyage to the shores of
Hudson's Bay. 'We had', writes its commander,</p>
<blockquote>a very narrow escape from shipwreck on the outward
passage, and actually struck thrice on dangerous rocks, and once
against an iceberg of great height and extent. The blows caused
the ship to leak so much that we were apprehensive of the vessel
keeping afloat, and, indeed, in this state of uncertainty,
pumping and baling to the utmost, we remained for six-and-thirty
hours. Then the carpenters were enabled to stop the
leak.</blockquote>
<p>Despite these mishaps, however, their voyage does not seem to
have been prolonged much beyond its estimated time. On August 30
the Prince of Wales anchored off York Factory, where the members
of the expedition landed. Here they made a stay of over a week
collecting stores, and therewith equipping one of the large
transport boats of the Hudson's Bay Company, in which they were
to continue their journey. On September 19 they resumed it, and
after a weary march of from seven to eight hundred miles they
reached Cumberland House, on the Saskatchewan River, on the 23rd
of the following month. Some three weeks previously Franklin had
had a narrow escape from drowning. He lost his footing on a rock
on which he was standing engaged in an attempt to force the boat
up a rapid, and was carried some distance down the swirling
torrent before he was able to stay his helpless descent by
grasping the branch of a willow, to which he held fast until
rescued from his hazardous position by his companions.</p>
<p>Franklin, as we know, was not disposed to underrate the
difficulties of his task, yet the event proved that even his
carefully considered and liberal estimate of the amount of time
which would be required for its completion fell short of the
mark. He had spoken, we have seen in his last letter, of nearly
three years as representing its probable duration, but, as a
matter of fact, it exceeded that period by nearly five months.
More than two whole years had, in fact, expired, and two dreary
winters had been passed, before they reached the shores of the
Arctic Ocean and could begin their attempt to survey the coast.
Nor was this due to material difficulties alone, though these, it
is true, were enormous. Their commodious but unwieldy transport
boat, heavily laden with stores, made naturally slow progress,
and though it was possible by unloading to traverse rapids of a
not too impetuous and precipitous character, it was, of course,
necessary to circumvent actual falls by way of 'portage.'
Twenty-one statute miles is Admiral Markham's computation of the
united length of all the portages crossed by them in less than
one-third of their journey, and, as each portage had to be
traversed seven times in order to transfer their goods across,
this involved nearly one hundred and fifty miles of walking.</p>
<p>But the difficulties, it must be repeated, were not material
alone. The voluminous letter-books of correspondence relating to
the earlier stages of the expedition are somewhat weary reading,
and would be wearier still were it not that Franklin's dogged
pertinacity and immovable self-control rebuke the reader's
impatience; but one gathers from it distinctly enough that the
leader of the expedition had to contend not only with Nature, but
with human nature also. The local authorities of the Hudson's Bay
Company were well affected enough towards the undertaking; and
there is no positive ground for affirming anything else of the
officials of the other great trading body, the North-Western
Company, which in those days divided jurisdiction with it over
this vast and wild region of the world. But, unfortunately, the
two companies, or some of their officers, were by no means well
affected towards each other; and, inasmuch as supplies had often
to be ordered through the servants of one company to be supplied
by those of its rival, their mutual jealousies were a constant
source of inconvenience, not to say a continual menace of
disaster.</p>
<p>It cannot perhaps be affirmed that either association, or
indeed that anybody in particular, was responsible for the first
serious disappointment which awaited Franklin at Fort Cumberland,
where he found, to his extreme concern, that the guides, hunters,
interpreters, and others whose services he had hoped to obtain,
were not to be had on any terms. Still, it is pretty evident that
he must have relied upon expert assurances on this point, and
that 'some one had blundered'. And the blunder was the more
serious because it appeared to Franklin to be only remediable by
undertaking a journey of nearly a thousand miles in the dead of
winter in order to reach a station at which this indispensable
assistance could be secured. Accordingly, on January 18, 1820,
leaving Dr. Richardson and Hood to pass the remainder of the
winter at Fort Cumberland and bring on the stores and provisions
as soon as the rivers were open for navigation, Franklin, Back,
and Hepburn set out in a couple of dog sledges, and with only
fifteen days' supplies, for Fort Chipewyan. Travelling in a
temperature that froze the mercury in the thermometer and 'the
tea in our teapots before we could drink it', they reached
Carlton House, an intermediate post, by February 1, and, after
remaining there a week to recruit, resumed and completed their
daring journey to Fort Chipewyan on March 26.</p>
<p>Here they remained during the rest of the long, lingering
winter, making such endeavours as they could to complete their
preparations for a forward movement as soon as the year was
sufficiently advanced. But their efforts met with but partial
success. For again the wretched rivalry between the two trading
companies which disputed the country intervened. They were
rejoined by Hood and Dr. Richardson as soon as the state of the
rivers permitted the transport of the stores in their keeping,
but it was in vain that Franklin strove to supplement them
adequately with additional supplies; and when the expedition at
last resumed its northward march, it was with but a scanty supply
of powder and little more than one day's provisions. Franklin
coldly reports the fact in one of his periodical despatches to
Mr. Goulburn, Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, with
what seems a merely formal expression of regret. Writing on July
17, the day before starting, he records the arrival of Dr.
Richardson and Hood three days before, and observes that the
additional supply of men they brought with them had enabled him
to make a selection of 'active, good men for our service, and to
complete the arrangements for leaving this place to-morrow
morning for Fort Providence.' But he adds: 'Our progress thither,
I regret to say, will be slower than I at first apprehended, from
the necessity we shall be under of hunting and fishing on the
way, as we have been unable to procure any provisions from either
of the forts here.'</p>
<p>Hunting and fishing on the way! This, indeed, was to 'make
adventure support adventure.' But 'the necessity' of so
doing&mdash;as, indeed, the fact itself of starting on a journey
of many hundred miles unprovided, or practically unprovided, with
anything to eat on the way&mdash;is here referred to quite in the
matter-of-fact manner of a man reporting an untoward but not at
all unnatural circumstance. The truth probably was that no mishap
of this kind, however serious, was any longer regarded by the
members of the expedition as otherwise than in the natural order
of affairs. They had already had a year's experience of the sort
of thing that was to be expected. But they did not yet know, nor
were they to experience until a good deal later, the worst of its
consequences. Accommodating themselves, however, in the meantime
with their usual cheerful stoicism to the situation, they
proceeded to hunt and fish their way along the chain of lakes and
rivers which lay between them and the Coppermine River. The Great
Slave Lake was reached in a few days, and by the 29th of the
month they arrived at Fort Providence, a station at its north
end. After a stay here of three or four days they resumed their
journey, and were joined on August 3 by a band of Indians with
their canoes, who had arranged to meet them at that point and
accompany them northward, hunting game for them on the way. Their
services in this capacity may have slightly expedited the
progress of the explorers; but it was not till the 20th of the
month that the next lake in this seemingly interminable chain was
reached, and then, to his intense mortification, Franklin found
that it was impossible to proceed further that year. The first
days after their arrival were spent in constructing winter
quarters on the south-west side of Winter Lake; log huts were
erected to house the officers and men of the expedition and their
stores, and the name of Fort Enterprise was given to the new
post. But while thus providing for a winter sojourn Franklin had
not at first abandoned the hope of proceeding on his journey, and
even of reaching the sea, before the year was out; and the
persistence with which he endeavoured to convert his Indian
companions to his views in the matter is so characteristic that
his report thereon to Mr. Goulburn should perhaps be transcribed
entire:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I sent for the Indians, who had been despatched on
hunting excursions, and communicated my intentions to them. You
can judge, sir, of the extreme mortification and disappointment
which all the officers experienced to find the leader and the
party were not only opposed to the proposal, but positively
refused to accompany us. They represented the very attempt as an
act of madness, and insisted that the winter had already
commenced, because the weather was then stormy and there had been
a sudden change in the temperature. From this determination no
argument or persuasion, which you may be assured were plentifully
applied, could turn them. But I will transcribe the leader's own
words on this occasion, as the best means of conveying his
sentiments. The attempt, he said, would be highly imprudent and
dangerous. The winter season had already commenced, as we saw,
which would soon be followed by severe weather, and that in
consequence the lives of those who embarked on such an
undertaking would be forfeited.<br>
<br>
It would require six days to get to the Coppermine River, and
five more to where wood would be found; until the expiration of
which time we could not expect to have fires, since there are no
trees whatever after leaving this lake. They only travelled the
road in summer when the moss is dry, which could not be expected
during the frequent rains of this season; and, in fact, he
concluded the discouraging recital by maintaining that it would
require forty days to get to the sea, and that under those
circumstances neither he nor the hunters would accompany us. It
was then mentioned to him that all these sentiments differed
widely from his former account given at Fort Providence and along
the route, and that up to this time we had been encouraged in the
expectation that the party not only could go towards the sea, but
should be accompanied by himself and the hunters. But this speech
had no effect in altering his opinion or determination, nor those
of the rest of the hunters, who are entirely under his guidance.
It was then pointed out to him that even the sight of the river
would be desirable, and he was informed that we were provided
with instruments which would infallibly point out when the cold
set in, and faithful promise was made to return on the first
warning of a change. But to this he answered that the cold
weather had already commenced, and repeated that in this part of
the country the transition from such weather to great severity
was immediate, and that in this respect it was unlike countries
more to the southward.<br>
<br>
It was then communicated to him that the sun would in a few days
be darkened (alluding to the eclipse expected on September 17),
and that it was desirable to observe the phenomenon as far north
as possible. He now began to feel hurt at our persisting to urge
him, and added with great warmth: 'I have said everything I can
to dissuade you from making such a rash attempt. It appears as if
you wished to lose your own lives and those Indians who might
accompany you. However, if you are determined to go, since we
have brought you hither, it shall not be said that we permitted
you to die alone. Some of my young men shall also go, but the
moment they embark we shall suppose them all gone, and begin to
deplore their loss as dead men.' I could only answer to this
forcible appeal by assuring him that I looked with the utmost
solicitude to the safety of my men, Indians as well as Canadians,
and that it was far from my wish to expose the life of a single
man, and repeated the promise to return on seeing the river, if
the weather should then prove too cold. These sentiments appeased
his warmth, but he then produced another reason which, I confess,
had weight&mdash;that this is the season when the reindeer skins
are in the best condition for clothing, and that his party must
prepare their underdresses, and also some skins for the
Canadians, who could not live here without them; and he justly
remarked that if the opportunity was now lost it could not be
regained, and that the consequence might be that some men would
be starved to death, especially the Indians, who were not strong
or capable of bearing severity of weather if slightly clothed,
like Canadians or Europeans. Perceiving that all efforts were in
vain to make him waive his objection, I left him for the night
without declaring any resolution, and I learnt the next morning
that after I was gone he spoke of returning back to Fort
Providence when he had collected provisions for our winter
consumption, thinking, since his advice was not followed, that he
was useless here. I deemed this information more important than
any other, considering the uncertainty of the Indian character,
because it is certain that his going would cause the whole tribe
to remove, and thereby be destructive to the prospect of our
getting pemmican made in the spring, which is indispensable for
our future proceedings. Therefore, with great reluctance and
concern, I thought it proper to relinquish the plan of proceeding
towards the sea, and instead proposed that a party should go to
see the [Coppermine River, and] find out the shortest path for
the conveyance of our stores to its banks in the spring, and
gather other information that might facilitate our progress at
that time.</blockquote>
<p>This reduced programme was successfully fulfilled. A party was
sent out on August 29, under the direction of Hood and Back, who
succeeded in reaching its banks in three days, just half the time
estimated by the Indian chief, and, after travelling down its
course for one day and in the reverse direction for four days,
returned to Fort Enterprise, which they regained on September 12,
a fortnight from the date of their departure.</p>
<p>After this the party settled down with such patience as they
could muster to their long confinement in the prison of a
northern winter. This trial is, it is well known, the hardest to
be borne by the Arctic explorer; it is the one which most
searchingly tests the inward resources of his nature. Upon a man
of Franklin's deeply religious temperament its effect may be
easily anticipated. During these long hours of enforced inaction
his mind naturally turned inward, and in a letter of this period
to his sister, Mrs. Wright, he makes her the confidant of his
pious and prayerful meditations. The language in which he
expresses himself belongs essentially to a bygone age of
religious thought; for, though the spirit of devotion be eternal
and unchangeable in the heart of man, its modes of expression are
as transient as all human inventions. It is the habit of our own
day for even the most devout souls to maintain a reserve in their
communications on spiritual concerns with those nearest and
dearest to them which would have been unintelligible, which would
even perhaps have seemed reprehensible, to religious men and
women of the early nineteenth century. Even in these sacred
matters there are changing fashions of human speech; and, just as
our later language of piety would have seemed to Franklin cold
and lifeless in its restraint, so his own utterances would be apt
in their effusiveness to convey to a reader of these days an
impression of the extravagant and unreal. But no one who makes
due allowance for such differences in the form of expression can
doubt that these outpourings came from the very depth of
Franklin's heart:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I shall not enter at any length (he writes) into the
subject of our pursuits and proceedings here, but rather devote
this sheet to the more interesting communication respecting my
present sentiments on religion, which I think will be equally, if
not more, gratifying to you, my dear sister; and before I enter
upon them I would humbly offer my grateful thanks to Almighty God
that the peculiar circumstances of my situation, arising from
want of society and full occupation, have led me to seek that
consolation from the perusal of religious books, which I have
found&mdash;especially in the Holy Bible&mdash;abundantly
supplied. To this sacred volume I have applied for grounds of
hope, comfort, and support, and never in vain; and I am fully
convinced that therein, and therein only, can be found the
treasures of heavenly love and mercy. I have been amazed at the
state of ignorance under which I laboured with respect to its
blessed contents. Neither the order, connection, or regularity of
God's mercies to the Jews were known to me. Consequently, His
goodness and the grandeur of the deliverances vouchsafed to them
were not duly appreciated by me. But an attentive perusal of His
Holy Word, with fervent application for His assistance, will open
all these mysteries to the inquiring mind, and lead you through
them to see the mighty work of redemption by the death of His
Blessed Son for all mankind. Truly rich and valuable are the
precepts and doctrines our Blessed Saviour taught, and amazing
His love for all mankind. Surely that heart must be awfully
impenitent which can read the recital of His sufferings unmoved
or without feeling a sincere desire to repent and pray fervently
for that heavenly grace which He faithfully promised to all who
firmly believe on Him and seek to do His will. Serious reflection
will soon convince the sinner of his guilt and of his inability
to do anything of himself; for every day's experience proclaims
to him with a powerful voice that he is weak, irresolute, and
unprofitable, and constantly exposed to the attacks of sin and
Satan. If, haply, under this conviction he should inquire, How,
then, can I be saved? would it not be joy unspeakable for him to
find that the Gospel points out the way? Christ, who died for the
salvation of sinners, is the way, the truth, and the life. Whoso
cometh unto Him in full purpose of heart shall in no wise be cast
out. Can anything be more cheering than these assurances, or
better calculated to fill the mind with heavenly impressions, and
lift up the heart in grateful adoration to God? This is the
commencement of the Christian joy which, if it beget a live faith
that worketh by love, producing the fruits of obedience, will
lead to everlasting life. But he should remember that our Blessed
Lord's example hath shown, and every portion of His Holy Word
declareth, that the Christian's life must be a continual warfare
against the world, the flesh, and the devil; he must never relax
his efforts, but strive continually against his evil passions and
propensities, and pray constantly that he may be strengthened by
the power of grace to surmount them.</blockquote>
<p>Very interesting, too, is it to find that among the religious
works by which Franklin was most impressed in these hours of
lonely meditation was the book which is understood to have first
awakened the religious emotion in the mind of Dr. Johnson, and
from which men of the most diverse temperaments have derived
spiritual support and stimulus&mdash;Law's 'Serious Call to a
Holy Life.' Of this and of Doddridge's 'Rise and Progress of
Religion', he writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I admire their systematic manners of devotion, and by
their arguments am convinced of the necessity and advantage of
more method and regularity in meditation and prayer than is
usually observed. . . . How different are my sentiments on these
books to what they were on first reading them! Then I could find
neither beauty nor force in their language or reasoning; but now
I think they abound in both, and, if read with a serious desire
to gain information on the most important subjects of life, much
fruit may be gathered from them. I would recommend them most
earnestly to all my dear relations, and I doubt not they would
derive benefit and instruction.</blockquote>
<p>So the long and dreary winter wore on; but it had not half run
its course before the little party were threatened with a more
formidable foe than either cold or solitude. The reindeer, which
had at first been plentiful enough to supply them with food,
unexpectedly shifted their ground shortly after the establishment
of the expedition in its winter quarters, and some considerable
time before the end of the year the explorers found themselves
threatened with the exhaustion of their supplies. Their stock of
provisions fell so low that at last it became absolutely
necessary to communicate with Fort Chipewyan, with a view to the
replenishment of their stores. For this arduous and perilous
service Mr. Back volunteered. He was accordingly despatched in
the month of November, and, after unexampled labours and
privations&mdash;he travelled more than 1,100 miles on
snow-shoes, protected at night by only a single blanket and a
deerskin against a temperature frequently down to -40&deg;, and
on one occasion as low as -57&deg;, and sometimes without food
for two or three consecutive days&mdash;the gallant young officer
returned on March 15, having successfully executed his
commission.</p>
<p>Nor at this, any more than at other stages of its course, were
the difficulties of the enterprise due solely to the opposition
of Nature. The letters exchanged between Franklin and the
'partners' of the North-Western Company at Fort Chipewyan are
somewhat painful reading. The correspondence starts with an
official despatch from Back at Fort Providence, complaining of
the non-arrival of stores entrusted to the Company's servants for
transport, and containing the strong statement that he has
discovered through other channels a great lukewarmness on the
part of the North-Western Company absolutely amounting to 'a
denial of further services to the expedition.' This naturally
drew indignant remonstrances from Franklin, addressed
respectively to Mr. Smith and Mr. Keith, the two agents, and
provoking from the latter a rejoinder in the same tone. Mr.
Keith, in fact, roundly lectures him on the impropriety of
imputing to the Company any want of goodwill towards the
expedition. It betrays, says he, 'an unguarded precipitation and
want of discernment little corresponding with your experience and
high station and character in life.' Franklin, it seems evident,
had been a little hasty, and in his subsequent letters he shows
himself anxious to disclaim the injurious construction placed
upon his words. Much allowance should in any case be made for a
man in want of supplies in the depth of an Arctic winter, and
chafing under the vexatious delays and miscarriages of many
months.</p>
<p>There is an end to everything, however, even to an Arctic
winter; and at 2 <small>P.M.</small> on June 14, 1821, the
expedition was at last able to leave Fort Enterprise behind it
and set out for the sea. The party consisted of Franklin and his
four English officers, a couple of Eskimo interpreters, who had
been respectively christened Augustus and Junius by some unknown
humourist, and about a dozen Indians and half-breed Canadian
<i>voyageurs</i>. Their means of travel and transport consisted
of two large canoes and several sledges. Before their departure
arrangements were made by Franklin with one of the Indian chiefs,
named Akaitcho, probably the chief with whom he had held the
discussion above quoted, for depositing a supply of provisions at
Fort Enterprise during their absence, with a view to the
contingency of their having to pass another winter at the
station. Little did they suspect at the time what terrible and
wellnigh fatal issues were dependent on the due execution of that
order.</p>
<p>The progress of the party was at the outset tediously slow, as
they had to cross many stretches of barren land and several high
and rugged hills, each man having to carry or drag a weight of
some 180 pounds; and it was not till July 1, or seventeen days
after their departure, that they at last reached the long-desired
waters of the Coppermine River. For another fortnight they made
their way down its stream, their course often obstructed and
their safety sometimes endangered by large masses of floating
ice, until, on June 14, Franklin had the high satisfaction of
recording in his journal: 'To-day Dr. Richardson ascended a lofty
hill about three miles from the encampment, and from its summit
obtained a distant view of the sea from NNE. to NE. by E. A large
promontory bore NNE. The surface appeared to be covered with ice.
He saw the sun set a few minutes before midnight from the same
elevated situation.' Another week's voyaging brought them to the
mouth of the river, and on June 21 the adventurous explorers
found themselves afloat upon the Arctic Sea.</p>
<p>The remaining history of their outward voyage belongs to those
records of geographical discovery to which it contributed so
interesting, and for those days so important, a chapter; and it
does not fall within the scope of this memoir to relate it in any
detail. It may suffice to quote the lucid and succinct account
which has been given of it by Admiral Markham: 'The coast along
which the explorers sailed in their small and frail barks was a
sterile and inhospitable one; cliff succeeded cliff in tiresome
and monotonous uniformity, the valleys that intervened being
covered with the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> that fell from the cliffs,
to the exclusion of any kind of herbage. Occasionally their
progress was temporarily impeded by ice, while a strong
"ice-blink" was invariably seen to seaward. It must not be
forgotten that the expedition was navigating a rock-bound coast
fringed with heavy masses of solid ice, that rose and fell with
every motion of a rough tempestuous sea, threatening momentarily
to crush the light, frail canoes, fit only for lake or river
navigation, in which Franklin and his party were embarked. This
voyage along the shores of the Arctic Sea must always take rank
as one of the most daring and hazardous exploits that has ever
been accomplished in the interest of geographical research.
Following all the tortuous sinuosities of the coast-line, and
accurately delineating the northern shore of North America as
they pushed onwards in an easterly direction, naming all the
principal headlands, sounds, bays, and islands that were
discovered, the expedition reached a point on August 18, in
latitude 68&deg; 19' N. and longitude 110&deg; 5' W., on the
coast of North America, where Franklin reluctantly came to the
conclusion that they had reached the end of their journey, and
must return from the interesting work on which they were engaged,
and for the following reasons. In the first place, they had only
three days' pemmican left, and the Canadian <i>voyageurs</i> had
consequently manifested a very decided reluctance to continue the
work of exploration, believing, and not unnaturally, that great
difficulty would be experienced at that time in replenishing
their fast decreasing store of provisions. In the second place,
the gales of wind which were so prevalent, were, they thought,
sure indications of the break-up of the travelling season, and,
therefore, that in itself appeared sufficient reason for them to
be thinking of wending their way in a southerly direction. The
absence of all traces of Eskimo, from whom they had calculated on
obtaining supplies of food, was also discouraging; while the
amount of time that had already been occupied in exploring the
various bays and sounds that lay in their route was so great that
it entirely precluded all hopes of reaching Repulse Bay before
the winter.</p>
<p>'Although on the chart the position reached by the expedition,
which was very appropriately named Point Turnagain, was only six
and a half degrees of longitude to the eastward of the mouth of
the Coppermine River, so tortuous and winding was the contour of
the newly discovered coast that they were actually obliged to
sail and paddle in their canoes a distance of 555 geographical
miles in order to accomplish the journey; this would be about
equal to the direct distance between the Coppermine River and
Repulse Bay. It was, therefore, obvious that the only prudent
course that could be pursued was to return as soon as possible,
in order to reach the Indians, who had been directed to procure a
supply of provisions for the expedition before the next winter
should set in.</p>
<p>'From their researches up to this point, Franklin had arrived
at the conclusion (subsequently proved to be a well-founded one),
that a navigable passage for ships along the coast by which they
had travelled was practicable, and, although he was disappointed
in not meeting his friend Captain Parry and his vessels, he felt
convinced that they stood an excellent chance of satisfactorily
clearing up the long-unsolved problem of a North-West
Passage.'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p align="center">THE FIGHT WITH FAMINE<br>
<br>
1821-1822</p>
<p><small>WITH</small> the commencement of the return journey we
resume a more detailed narrative; for, if the outward voyage
belongs rather to the province of geographical history, and has,
as such, been dealt with in the fullest detail by other writers
on this subject, the story of the awful struggle back to Fort
Enterprise is in a more emphatic sense the property of a
biographer of Franklin, and has never, perhaps, been
circumstantially related, save by one whom his own modesty
forbade to do full justice to the splendid heroism of the
exploit.</p>
<p>It is natural to inquire why Franklin took that decision to
return to Fort Enterprise by a different route, which was fraught
with such disastrous and wellnigh fatal consequences for the
expedition; but it appears from his journal that he had no
choice. His original intention had been to return as he had come,
by way of the Coppermine River, but his very scanty stock of
provisions, and the length of the voyage to the mouth of that
river, in the very forward state of the season, 'rendered it
necessary', he says, 'to proceed to a nearer place; and it was
determined that we should go hence to Arctic Sound, where we had
found animals very abundant, and entering Hood's River', so
named, of course, after Franklin's young officer, 'to advance up
the stream as far as it was navigable, and there construct small
canoes out of the longer ones. We had already experienced that
the country between Cape Barrow and the Coppermine River was
inadequate to supply our party, and it seemed probable that it
would be still more impracticable now. Besides, we must expect
the frequent recurrence of gales, which would cause much
detention, if not danger, in proceeding along this very rocky
part of the coast.'</p>
<p>So, then, it was resolved, and so done. The fateful decision
to return by way of Hood River was taken, it seems, on August 23,
and two days later the explorers reached the mouth of the stream
to which they had determined to commit themselves and their
fortunes. 'Our pemmican', writes Franklin, 'was now reduced so
low that we could only issue a few mouthfuls to each person.'
Already, indeed, the grave apprehension seems to have occurred to
them that they might not live to tell the tale of their
adventures. In crossing Riley's Bay 'a tin case was thrown
overboard, containing an outline of our proceedings hitherto, and
the latitude of the part we turned back from, with a request that
it might be forwarded to the Admiralty if picked up.' For another
ten days they pursued their way up the Hood River, but on
September 3 it became evident that they must abandon it. It was
bearing far too much to the westward, and their observations told
them that to follow its course would lead them away from the
direct route to Fort Enterprise, their destination. Accordingly,
on the day named, they definitely resolved to quit its banks, and
to strike across the country in a south-westerly direction.
Henceforth their journey had to be performed almost entirely on
foot over a stony and barren country, but they carried their
canoes with them against the event of having to cross any lakes
or rivers that might lie on the route, or that flowed in the
right direction. And at this point begins a story of unexampled
sufferings and of unrivalled fortitude&mdash;an ordeal extending
with rare and brief intermissions over a period of more than two
months.</p>
<p>'We sat down to breakfast at 10.30 on September 4', writes
Franklin in his manuscript journal; 'and this', he adds quietly,
'finished the remainder of our meat' Henceforth, and until they
should arrive at the distant station where they hoped to find
provisions stored for them, they were to be dependent on what
they could find in that inhospitable region for their daily food;
and they did not find much. Later in the day the hunters 'saw
several reindeer, principally males, going to the southward, but
could not get them.' To add to their discomforts, a violent storm
of wind and rain set in and lasted for the better part of three
days. The party, while it was at its height, remained in their
tents, but on the third day they determined to push on. They
feared from this sudden and totally unexpected change in the
weather that winter had begun in earnest, and thought that by
delay they would be exposed to increased difficulties, which they
would be less able to combat when reduced to a more weakly state
by the pangs of hunger. Orders were accordingly given for a
start, but it was no easy matter to carry them out. 'The tents
and bedclothes were frozen, and even our garments were stiffened
by frost and exposure to the keen wind, which blew so piercingly
that no one could keep his hands long out of his mittens, and the
men, therefore, had great difficulty in arranging their packages.
We had no means of making a fire, the moss, at all times
difficult to kindle, being covered by the ice and snow. On being
exposed to the air I became quite faint with hunger? but on
eating a small piece of portable soup I was soon sufficiently
recovered to move on with the party. We commenced our cheerless
march at 10 <small>A.M.</small> The ground was covered with snow
a foot in depth, and we had to pass across swamps and marshy
places, sometimes stepping up to the knee in water, and at others
on the side of a slippery stone which often brought us down. The
men who carried the canoes had a most laborious task. They even
frequently fell down, either prostrated by the violence of the
wind or by the insecurity of their steps.' One of these accidents
had a very serious result. 'The best canoe was so damaged as to
be rendered wholly useless. This was indeed a serious misfortune
to us, as the remaining canoe had been made through mishap too
small, and we were doubtful whether it would be sufficient to
transport the party across any river.' But it is an ill wind that
blows nobody any good. 'As the accident could not now be
remedied, we determined on turning the materials to the best
account. We made a fire of the bark and timbers, and cooked the
remainder of the soup and arrowroot' The meal, though scanty
enough for men who had been three days fasting, seemed to allay
their hunger and refresh them. 'We proceeded in the afternoon
over some gravelly hills and across small marshy meadows, and
encamped at 6 <small>P.M.</small> A few partridges were killed,
and half a one was issued to each person. This, boiled with a
small quantity of <i>tripe de roche</i>, formed our supper. A few
willows were collected from under the snow, which served to cook
our meal and thaw our frozen shoes so that they could be
changed.'</p>
<p>As the Arctic delicacy above referred to is destined to play a
very prominent though not very agreeable part in the subsequent
narrative, it may be as well to pause at this first mention of it
to give a brief account of its character and properties.</p>
<p><i>Tripe de roche</i>, then, is simply a lichen peculiar to
these latitudes, and known to botanists, by reason of its
circular form and the surface of the leaf being marked with
curved lines, as <i>Gyrophora</i>. It is described, with some
excess of scientific politeness, as 'edible'; the fact being that
it can be eaten, though with extreme difficulty and distaste, by
most people, and by others not at all. Hood, as will appear
later, belonged to the latter class. Dr. Richardson's account of
its qualities and effects is highly unfavourable. 'We used it',
he says, 'as an article of food, but, not having the means of
extracting the bitter principle from it, it proved nauseous to
all, and noxious to several of the party, producing severe bowel
complaints.'</p>
<p>On this wretched stuff and what remained to them of their
'bag' of partridges they subsisted for the next three days; and
on the 10th, when matters were again becoming serious, they
espied, to their great joy, a herd of musk-oxen grazing in a
neighbouring valley.</p>
<blockquote>The party instantly halted, and all the hunters were
sent out. We beheld their proceedings with the utmost anxiety
from the brow of a hill for nearly two hours, and many, I have no
doubt, offered fervent prayers for their success. At length they
fired, and, to our infinite satisfaction and relief, we beheld an
animal fall to the ground, and a second badly wounded, which
escaped from them and fled with the rest of the herd. This
success infused spirit into our breasts, and animated every
countenance. We hastily proceeded to join the hunters, but before
our arrival the animal was skinned and cut up. Our appetites were
so keen that the raw intestines were eaten on the spot, and
pronounced to be excellent. The men requested we might encamp.
The tents were quickly pitched; some willows which peeped above
the snow were speedily gathered, a fire made, and supper cooked,
which was eaten with avidity, the first hearty meal we had had
since the morning of September 4. Two of the hunters went after
the herd after supper, but could not come up with
them.</blockquote>
<p>The flesh of the musk-ox lasted them for three days; and on
the fourth they were reduced to their fungoid diet once more.
Their journey, too, was now interrupted by discouraging
obstacles. On the 13th they found their way barred by a vast
lake, and were compelled to coast its rocky shores all that day
and part of the next, in the vain endeavour to find a suitable
crossing-place. Finding at length that it appeared to terminate
in a river at a few miles from their last night's encampment,
they resolved on proceeding thither. 'Here,' writes Franklin, 'I
cannot forbear mentioning an act of kindness performed by
Perrault, one of our Canadian <i>voyageurs</i>, which won the
deepest gratitude from every officer. When they were assembled
round a small fire, and on the point of starting, he presented
each of us with a small piece of meat which he had saved from his
own allowance. This act of generosity, so totally unexpected, and
coming at such a seasonable time, drew forth tears.'</p>
<p>Hardly had this touching incident occurred, when gunshots were
heard in the direction the party were proposing to advance, and
soon afterwards the <i>voyageur</i> Cr&eacute;dit appeared with
the welcome intelligence that he had killed two deer. Once again,
then, they had been rescued from starvation; but it was, on the
whole, a day of more disaster than good fortune. The canoe in
which Franklin attempted to cross the river was upset, and,
although he himself escaped and made his way with difficulty to
the opposite bank, the portfolio containing the greater part of
his astronomical and meteorological observations was
irrecoverably lost. The fate of the canoe itself was for some
time in doubt, and 'I cannot', records Franklin, 'express my
sentiment on viewing the melancholy scene. Standing, as I did,
perfectly alone, unprovided either with gun or ammunition,
separated from my companions by the fatal stream, and conscious
that if the canoe should be destroyed or rendered so ineffective
as to be unable to carry the party across, I never could regain
them, my relief and joy can easily be imagined when I perceived
the canoe was safe. The officers were so kind as to embark a
person to make a fire for me by the first conveyance.' They
afterwards moved a little higher up, and the whole party, with
their baggage, effected a crossing in safety, though the canoe
filled with water at every traverse.</p>
<p>This was September 14, and for another week they struggled
slowly on, subsisting mainly on <i>tripe de roche</i>, with the
occasional addition of a chance partridge or two, though they
were reduced on one day of exceptional straits to devouring some
fragments of deer skin and bones, the leavings of the wolves that
had killed the animals in the previous spring. So they fared till
the 26th, when again they were lucky enough to shoot five small
deer, and to fill their bellies for the first time for many days
with a substantial meal. But the leader of the party could have
found little in these chance strokes of good fortune to relieve
the anxiety which his ever-darkening prospects must have
inspired. A new cause of disquietude had now presented itself in
the demoralisation of the Canadian <i>voyageurs</i>. Peltier, who
had received several severe falls in carrying the remaining
canoe, refused to be burdened with it any longer, and it was
handed over to Vaillant, one of his comrades. The man seemed at
first to be managing it so well that Franklin left him a little
in the rear, and went on to join the party in advance; but some
time afterwards, on going back to search for the men, who were
long in coming up, Franklin found to his horror that they had
left the canoe behind them. It had been, they alleged, so
completely broken by another fall as to be rendered incapable of
repair and entirely useless. 'The anguish this intelligence
occasioned may be conceived,' he writes, 'but it is beyond my
power to describe it. Impressed, however, with the necessity of
taking it forward, even in the state in which these men
represented it to be, we urgently desired them to fetch it; but
they declined going, and the strength of the officers was
inadequate to the task. To their infatuated obstinacy on this
occasion a great portion of the melancholy circumstances which
attended our subsequent progress may perhaps be attributed.' But
the wretched <i>voyageurs</i> had, it is evident, got completely
out of hand. 'The men now seemed to have lost all hope of being
preserved; and all the arguments we could use failed in
stimulating them to the least exertion.'</p>
<p>On the 26th of the month they at last struck the Coppermine
River, and, as their shortest way to Fort Enterprise was to cross
to the opposite bank as soon as possible, the loss of the canoe
was now severely felt; for, though the current was swift and
there were two rapids in this part of its course, it could have
been crossed in a canoe with ease and safety. The river was
carefully examined for a ford, but in vain. Then it was suggested
that a raft might be made of the willows growing in the
neighbourhood, or even that the framework of a boat might be
constructed with them and covered with the canvas of the tents;
but both those schemes had to be abandoned through the obstinacy
of the interpreters and the most experienced <i>voyageurs</i>,
who declared that neither raft nor boat would prove adequate to
the conveyance of the party, and that they would only be losing
valuable time in making the attempt. The fact was that the men
did not believe they had reached the Coppermine River, and it
needed all the repeated and confident assurance of their officers
that they were within forty miles of Fort Enterprise to rouse
them from their despondency. They at last began to look more
favourably on the boat-building scheme, but it was found that
there were no willows tall enough to form the frame of a
sufficiently large canoe. The alternative of the raft had to be
definitely adopted, and a search was made along the border of
Point Lake, which they had reached by this time, for timber
suitable to the purpose. The search was fruitless. It led them
only to an arm of the lake stretching so far away to the
north-east that the idea of rounding it and travelling over so
barren a country was 'dreadful', the more so as it was to be
feared that other arms equally large might obstruct their path,
and that the strength of the party would fail long before they
could reach the only part where they were certain of finding pine
wood, a point twenty-five miles distant in a direct line.</p>
<p>'While we halted to consider of this subject and to collect
our party, the carcase of a deer was discovered in the cleft of a
rock into which it had fallen in the spring. It was putrid, but
it was little less acceptable to us on that account in our
present circumstances, and, a fire being kindled, it was devoured
on the spot' Refreshed by this horrible meal, the
<i>voyageurs</i> took a more favourable view of the willow
considered as a raft-building material, and declared their belief
that it would be quite possible to cross the stream on a
willow-built raft. The party accordingly having returned about a
mile towards the rapid, encamped in a willow copse, and the work
of construction was at once set about.</p>
<p>The day following (September 29) was signalised by an act of
such splendid and indeed reckless devotion, that, though Franklin
himself was not the hero of it, the course of this narrative must
be arrested for a moment in order to record it in his own
words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The men commenced at an early hour to bind up the
willows in faggots for the construction of the raft, which was
completed by seven o'clock, but as the sticks were green the raft
was not sufficiently buoyant to support more than one man. We
hoped, however, that if a line could be carried across by this
person, the whole party might be transported over the river by
hauling the raft backwards and forwards. Several attempts were
made by Belanger and B&eacute;noit to convey the raft across, but
ineffectually for want of oars. Whenever they had got a short
distance from the shore they could not reach bottom with the
longest pole we could construct (by tying all the tent-poles
together), and then their paddle, which was the only substitute
for an oar we had, was inefficient to prevent the raft from being
driven into the shore again by the current and a strong breeze,
which blew from the opposite side of the river. During these
trials all the men had suffered extremely from the coldness of
the water (the temperature being 38&deg;), in which they were
necessarily immersed, and having witnessed these repeated
failures we began to consider the scheme as hopeless. At this
time, Dr. Richardson, prompted by a noble and humane desire to
relieve his suffering companions, proposed to swim across the
river with a line, and when landed to haul the raft over; but
this service had near cost his valuable life. He launched into
the stream with the line round his middle, but when he had got a
short distance from the land his arms became benumbed with the
cold and he lost the power of moving them. Still he persevered,
and, turning on his back, had nearly gained the opposite shore,
when to our infinite alarm we beheld him sink. Happily, the
direction he had previously given to haul upon the line was
understood, and by our doing so he again appeared upon the
surface and was then gently dragged to the shore. He could just
articulate when landed. We placed him between blankets, which
were arranged before a fire near the spot, and fortunately he was
in a state to give some general directions respecting the manner
of treating him, and by the blessing of God, and to our great
relief, he recovered strength gradually, and after a few hours
could converse. We regretted then to learn that the skin of the
left side of his body was deprived of feeling owing to the too
great heat of the fire, and I am sorry to add he suffered from
that inconvenience some months. When he was about to step first
into the water he placed his foot on a large dagger-like stone,
and received a gash to the bone, but this misfortune did not
prevent him from attempting to execute his generous
undertaking.</blockquote>
<p>Then follows this piteously graphic detail:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I cannot forbear to mention how shocked every one was
at seeing his debilitated frame when he had undressed, a perfect
skeleton of skin and bone. The sight drew from each person an
involuntary sigh, and from many of our Canadian <i>voyageurs</i>
the pathetic exclamation, '<i>Ah! que nous sommes
maigres!</i>'</blockquote>
<p>A new and more efficient raft was constructed, but the wind,
which had been rising, was now too high to allow of their using
it. To add to their discomfort, heavy snowfalls set in, and for
three days they were detained in their foodless condition, living
on scraps of leather and <i>tripe de roche</i>, and unable to
cross the river which lay between them and their homeward route.
At last the gradual conversion of the <i>voyageurs</i> advanced a
further stage. They had risen from the conception of a pinewood
to that of a willow raft, and one of them now went further and
'proposed to make a canoe of the fragments of painted canvas in
which we wrapped our bedding. The proposal met with an eager
assent, and after two days spent upon it the work was pronounced
finished. The canoe was brought to the beach, where all the party
were assembled in anxious expectation. St. Germain embarked in it
amid the heartfelt prayers of his comrades for his success, and
contrived to reach the opposite shore. The canoe was then drawn
back again by the rope attached to it, and another person
transported; and in this manner, by drawing it backwards and
forwards, the whole party were conveyed over without any serious
accident.'</p>
<p>On their reaching the southern bank of the Coppermine River,
which at this part of its course flows nearly east and west, the
variable spirits of the <i>voyageurs</i> revived in an
extraordinary manner. Each of them shook the officers by the
hand, declaring that they now considered the worst of their
difficulties over, and they did not doubt of reaching Fort
Enterprise in a few days even in their feeble condition.
Franklin, however, as he was not liable to their fits of profound
depression, so did not share their excessive elation. Judging it
to be impossible that the entire party could hold out against
famine for the long period of time it would take them to reach
Fort Enterprise in their debilitated state, he despatched Back,
who was the youngest and most robust of the party, to the Fort
with three of the <i>voyageurs</i> to bring back supplies with
all possible speed from the store which he had engaged the
Indians to deposit at that station. He himself, with Richardson,
Hood, Hepburn, the eight remaining <i>voyageurs</i>, and an
Iroquois named Michel, struggled on in the rear. Snow had been
falling heavily and lay deep on the ground, making their progress
distressingly slow.</p>
<blockquote>Mr. Hood, who was now very feeble, and Dr.
Richardson, who attached himself to him, walked together at a
gentle pace in the rear of the party. I kept with the foremost
men, to cause them to halt occasionally until the stragglers came
up.</blockquote>
<p>They supped that night off <i>tripe de roche</i> and some
scraps of roasted leather. The distance completed by them had
been only six miles. In the course of the next day two of the
Canadians, Cr&eacute;dit and Vaillant, fell out of the party, and
one of their companions came up with the main body bringing the
sad tidings that they were unable to proceed further.</p>
<blockquote>Some willows being discovered in a valley near to us,
I proposed to halt the party there while Dr. Richardson went back
to visit them. I hoped, too, that when the sufferers received the
information of a fire being kindled at so short a distance they
would be cheered, and use their utmost efforts to reach it; but
this proved a vain hope. The Doctor found Vaillant about a mile
and a half in the rear, much exhausted with cold and fatigue.
Having encouraged him to advance to the fire, after repeated
solicitations he made the attempt, but fell down in the deep snow
at every step. Leaving him in this situation, the Doctor went
about half a mile further back to the spot where Credit was said
to have halted, but, the track being nearly obliterated, it
became unsafe for him to go further. Returning, he passed
Vaillant, who, having moved only a few yards during his absence,
had fallen down, was unable to rise, and could scarcely answer
his questions. Being unable to afford him any effectual
assistance, he hastened on to inform us of his
situation.</blockquote>
<p>Another of the <i>voyageurs</i>, J. B. Belanger, then
volunteered to go back to Vaillant and bring up his burden. On
his return with it he stated that he had found the poor fellow
lying on his back, benumbed with cold and incapable of being
roused. The stoutest men of the party were earnestly entreated to
bring him to the fire, but they declared themselves, as indeed
might well be the case, unequal to the task.</p>
<p>A consultation was now held among the officers. Franklin felt
that the time had come when the resolution which all no doubt had
foreseen and all dreaded must at last be definitely taken. It had
become only too clear that the remnant of the little party which
had dared and suffered so much together must separate. The
Canadians were too weak to bear their burdens further. They
begged that they might be allowed to throw them down in order
that they might make their way to Fort Enterprise before their
strength failed them altogether. Franklin could not but feel that
their prayer was irresistible, and that they must be relieved of
their loads if their lives were to be saved. Hood, moreover, was
now almost too feeble to advance further, and Dr. Richardson
offered to remain behind with him and a single attendant,
together with any other member of the party who might wish to
halt, at the first place at which sufficient wood could be found
and enough <i>tripe de roche</i> for ten days' consumption.
Franklin in the meantime was to proceed as expeditiously as
possible with the other men to the Fort, and send back to them an
immediate supply of provisions. The greater part of the
ammunition was also to be left behind with Richardson and Hood,
as it was hoped that this deposit might be an inducement to the
Indians to venture across the Barren Lands to their relief. 'This
proposal', writes Franklin, 'was acceded to on my part, though
the idea of even a temporary separation from my friends in
affliction was extremely distressing to my feelings; but this
would be the only arrangement which could contribute to the
safety of the party.'</p>
<p>The morning of the next day was mild, with a light breeze from
the south, a change of temperature encouraging to the minds of
men who contemplated encamping; and on arriving at a cluster of
pines a few miles from their last night's resting-place, a tent
was pitched, and Dr. Richardson, Hood, and Hepburn prepared to
take up their quarters in it. The offer was again repeated that
any of the men who felt themselves too weak to proceed at a quick
pace should remain behind, but none accepted it. Franklin
accordingly set off with seven of the <i>voyageurs</i>, and the
party toiled painfully on through deep snow for about four miles
and a half, when they were obliged to encamp; but by this time
two of his companions were utterly exhausted. Belanger, one of
the <i>voyageurs</i>, burst into tears and, declaring he could go
no further, begged to be permitted to go back and join the
officers in the rear on the following day. The Iroquois Michel
soon afterwards joined in the request. Franklin consented to
their returning if they felt as weak the next morning, but
endeavoured, with that cheery and indomitable pluck which, seems
never to have failed him for a moment throughout the whole awful
ordeal, to dispel the gloom which this incident had thrown over
the party by assuring them that it was but a short distance from
the Fort, and that in all probability they would reach it in a
few days. No <i>tripe de roche</i> was to be found, and supper
consisted of a so-called tea made of herbs. The next morning,
Belanger and Michel, not having recovered any of their strength,
were sent back again with a letter from Franklin to Dr.
Richardson informing him of a more eligible encampment in a pine
wood a little further on than the halting-place which had been
selected. Perrault was the next to give in and to be sent back,
and later in the day Antonio Fontano broke down, and begged, and
was permitted, to return. The number of Franklin's companions was
now reduced to four&mdash;Peltier, Semandr&eacute;,
B&eacute;noit, and Adam. With them he walked on about a mile
further, and then encamped for the night under a rocky hill
whereon some <i>tripe de roche</i> was seen growing; but the weed
was frozen so hard upon the rock that the men could not gather
it, and were obliged to sup again on the 'country tea' and some
pieces of fried leather.</p>
<p>Next day, however, they were enabled to collect some of the
lichen, and to enjoy the first meal they had had for four days
past. On October 10 the famine-stricken men were mocked by the
appearance on a neighbouring hill of a herd of reindeer, which
they were too feeble and too cold to follow. Again no <i>tripe de
roche</i> could be found, and once more the country tea and a few
strips of fried leather had to serve them for supper.</p>
<p>At last, on October 11, five days after quitting the
companions they had left behind them, Fort Enterprise came in
sight, and as fast as their exhaustion would permit they hurried
forward to enter it. But here the most cruel of all their
disappointments awaited the starving wanderers. They staggered
into the Fort to find it entirely empty! There was no store of
food; no trace of the Indians who had been so straitly charged,
and had so repeatedly promised, to provide it; no letter from Mr.
Wentzel, the official of the North-western Company, who had
travelled part of the way with them, to direct them to any spot
where provisions might be found. Even at this appalling moment,
however, Franklin's first thought was for others. 'Under these
distressing circumstances,' he says, 'my mind was instantly
filled with a fearful anxiety for our suffering companions who
had been left in the rear, whose safety entirely depended on our
sending speedy relief from this place. The whole party shed
tears, for it was impossible to divest our minds of the
melancholy apprehension that the lives of our companions would in
all probability be forfeited.' For their sole comfort they found
a letter from Mr. Back, dated the same day, and informing them
that he was going to search for the Indians, but was of course
doubtful whether he should meet them, as he had no direction to
follow, and that, if he failed, he intended to proceed to Fort
Providence, should the strength of his party permit, and thence
send succour to us. It was evident, however, that any relief from
Fort Providence would not only be long in reaching Franklin's
party, but could not be sufficiently ample to afford succour to
their companions behind.</p>
<p>The first thing, however, was to replenish, however scantily,
their own fast-waning fuel of life. Food, if food it could be
called, was sought and found, but they were now to partake of the
poorest, not to say the foulest, of all their many miserable
meals. They lighted in an outhouse on some rotting deer skins,
the refuse of their last winter's sojourn at the Fort; they
grubbed up some old bones from an ash-heap, and these, with
<i>tripe de roche</i>, 'we considered would support us tolerably
well for a time.' The bones, though quite acrid from
decomposition, were 'pounded and boiled with the <i>tripe de
roche</i> and made a very palatable mess.' It was devoured in a
temperature ranging from 15&deg; to 20&deg; below zero. Their
bodily condition was now truly distressing. They were so weak and
emaciated as to be unable to move except for a few yards at a
time; they were afflicted with swellings in their joints, limbs,
and other parts of their bodies; their eyeballs were dilated;
they spoke in hollow, sepulchral tones and their mouths were raw
and excoriated, as a result of the fare on which they had
subsisted. Adam in particular was suffering terribly, and grew
daily worse.</p>
<p>After nine more days spent under these fearful privations,
Franklin resolved to set out, with the <i>voyageur</i>
B&eacute;noit and the Eskimo Augustus, in search of the Indians,
and, equipped with snow-shoes, they started forth on the 20th. On
the day after his departure, however, he was unfortunate enough
to break one of his snow-shoes, and, fearing lest the accident
should retard the progress of the party, Franklin returned to
Fort Enterprise after giving Benoit careful instructions as to
the course he was to pursue. Another week dragged on its course
under the same wretched conditions. Adam and Semandr&eacute; were
now unable to rise from their beds, and Peltier was often too
weak to assist his leader in gathering <i>tripe de roche</i> and
in searching for bones, which were now becoming more and more
hard to find. Nothing, however, could shake Franklin's invincible
fortitude or provoke from him a single word of complaint. On the
27th he writes in his journal:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I have this day been twenty-one years in H.M.
service, and exposed to many hardships in my professional career,
but was never placed in such a melancholy and affecting situation
as the present. However, with sincere praises to Almighty God for
His past goodness and protection, I will humbly confide in His
gracious mercy and hope for deliverance from this severe
trial.</blockquote>
<p>Two days afterwards, to the great surprise and, for a moment,
the unmixed joy of the leader, who had almost given them up for
lost, Dr. Richardson and Hepburn crawled painfully into the Fort.
But Franklin's gratification at their safety was soon to be
dashed by the tale of horror which they had to unfold. Poor Hood
was dead, murdered, it was supposed, and it was Richardson's own
hand that had executed justice on his murderer. Of the whole
party that had remained behind and had been reinforced by those
of Franklin's detachment whose strength had failed them, and who
had been compelled to return, but these two now survived.
Perrault and Belanger, the <i>voyageurs</i> who had fallen out of
the advance party, were the first to be missed. They were never
again heard of, and, though the manner of their death was never
conclusively ascertained, there is the strongest ground for
suspicion that they were killed by Michel in order that the
wretched man might appease the pangs of famine by devouring their
bodies. Before, however, their absence had given much anxiety, a
more sinister cause for suspecting Michel had arisen. On the
morning of Sunday, October 20, Richardson, who had gone out on an
expedition to gather lichen, leaving Hood 'sitting before the
tent at the fireside arguing with Michel', and Hepburn employed
in cutting down a tree for firewood at a short distance off,
heard the report of a gun, and shortly afterwards the voice of
Hepburn calling to him in tones of great alarm, to 'come
quickly.' Hastening back to the camp, he found Hood lying
lifeless, shot through the head. Michel, who was standing near
him, being questioned as to how it had happened, declared that he
had not been present at the moment, and that Hood, whether
intentionally or by mischance, had shot himself. But the
character alike of the wound and of the weapon entirely precluded
belief in the story. The shot had entered the back part of the
dead man's head, and passed out at the forehead, and the muzzle
of the gun had been applied so close as to set fire to the
nightcap behind. The gun itself was of the longest kind supplied
to the Indians, and could not have possibly been placed by Hood
himself in a position to inflict such a wound. Hepburn, moreover,
averred positively that Michel was not absent when the gunshot
was discharged, but, on the contrary, was standing on the precise
spot from which the fatal shot could have been fired. According
to Hepburn's statement, Hood and Michel were speaking to each
other in an elevated, angry tone, the former being then seated at
the fireside and hidden from him by intervening willows; but on
hearing the report he looked up and saw Michel 'rising up from
before the tent-door, or just behind where Mr. Hood was seated,
and then going into the tent. Thinking that the gun had been
discharged for the purpose of cleaning it, he did not go to the
fire at first, and when Michel called to him that Mr. Hood was
dead a considerable time had elapsed.'</p>
<p>This last circumstance in itself sufficed to demonstrate the
falsehood of Michel's account of the matter; for his explanation
of his alleged absence was that Hood had 'sent him into the tent
for the short gun', an errand which would only have taken a few
minutes to execute, so that he must, on his own showing, have for
some considerable time withheld the fact of Hood's death from his
companions. Strong, however, as were their suspicions, they dared
not at the moment openly evince them, and not a word was said to
Michel to reveal their belief that he was guilty of the deed. The
man, however, 'accused himself by excuse', repeatedly protesting
that he was incapable of such a crime, and at the same time
taking great care to prevent Richardson and Hepburn from being
left alone together. But inasmuch as this chapter of tragic
incidents was closed by an act of stern justice and
self-protective necessity, which did not, however, escape the
censures of the 'armchair critic' at home, it is desirable to let
Dr. Richardson himself complete the narrative in his own words.
Resolved to push on to the Fort at all hazards, he and his party
had struck their camp on the morning of the 23rd, 'thick snowy
weather and a head wind' having delayed their departure till that
day. Hepburn and Michel had each a gun. Richardson carried a
small pistol, which Hepburn had loaded for him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>In the course of the march Michel alarmed us by his
gestures and conduct, was constantly muttering to himself,
expressed an unwillingness to go to the Fort, and tried to
persuade me to go southward to the woods, where he said he could
maintain himself all the winter by killing deer. In consequence
of this behaviour and the expression of his countenance, I
requested him to leave and to go to the southward by himself. The
proposal increased his ill-nature; he threw out some obscure
hints of freeing himself from all restraint on the morrow; and I
overheard him muttering threats against Hepburn, whom he openly
accused of having told stories against him. He also for the first
time assumed such a tone of superiority in addressing me as
evinced that he considered us to be completely in his power, and
he gave vent to several expressions of hatred towards the white
people, or, as he termed us in the idiom of the <i>voyageurs</i>,
the French, some of whom he said had killed and eaten his uncle
and two of his relations. In short, taking every circumstance
into consideration, I came to the conclusion that he would
attempt to destroy us on the first opportunity that offered, and
that he had hitherto abstained from doing so from his ignorance
of the way to the Fort, but that he would never suffer us to go
thither in company with him. In the course of the day he had
several times remarked that we were pursuing the same course that
Mr. Franklin was doing when he left him, and that by keeping
towards the setting sun he could find his way himself. Hepburn
and I were not in a condition to resist even an open attack, nor
could we by any device escape from him. Our united strength was
far inferior to his, and, beside his gun, he was armed with his
pistols, an Indian bayonet, and a knife. In the afternoon, coming
to a rock on which there was some <i>tripe de roche</i>, he
halted, and said he would gather it whilst we went on, and that
he would soon overtake us. Hepburn and I were now left together
for the first time since Mr. Hood's death, and he acquainted me
with several circumstances which he had observed of Michel's
behaviour, and which confirmed me in the opinion that there was
no safety for us except in his death, and he offered to be the
instrument of it. I determined, however, as I was thoroughly
convinced of the necessity of the dreadful act, to take the whole
responsibility upon myself, and on Michel's coming up I put an
end to his life by shooting him through the head with a pistol.
Had my own life alone been threatened, I would not have purchased
it by such a measure; but I considered myself as entrusted also
with the protection of Hepburn's, a man who by his humane
attention and devotedness had so endeared himself to me that I
felt more anxiety for his safety than for my own. Michel had
gathered no <i>tripe de roche</i>, and it was evident to me that
he had halted for the purpose of putting his gun in order with
the intention of attacking us, perhaps while we were in the act
of encamping. I have dwelt in the preceding narrative on many
circumstances of Michel's conduct, not for the purpose of
aggravating it, but to put the reader in possession of the reason
that influenced me in depriving a fellow-creature of
life.</blockquote>
<p>Nothing, of course, could have mitigated the painful shock
which Franklin received from the tidings of Hood's tragic end. It
was the manner of his death rather than his loss which was so
agitating to his leader, who, as appeared afterwards, had already
abandoned all hope that his young comrade's life would be
preserved. He seems to have been the only one of the party whose
digestive organs obstinately revolted against the miserable food
on which his companion could just manage to keep body and soul
together; and discovering, as Franklin did when he reached Fort
Enterprise, that this would have for an indefinite period to be
the sole food of the party he had left behind him, he gave up
Hood for lost. This, as will be seen hereafter, he brings out
quite clearly, though with much tenderness and delicacy, in his
reply to a subsequent communication from the bereaved father. But
to return to our narrative.</p>
<p>Hepburn, just before reaching the Fort, had had the good luck
to shoot a partridge. The starving men hurriedly tore the
feathers from the bird, held it for a few minutes before the
fire, and then, dividing it into equal portions, greedily
devoured it. It was the first morsel of flesh they had tasted for
thirty-one days, unless 'the small gristly particles'
occasionally found adhering to the bones on which they had helped
to support their lives could be so described.</p>
<p>From what inward reserves of strength and spirit the three
Englishmen contrived to sustain themselves during the awful week
that followed must ever be a mystery to all who have read the
harrowing story. From the first, however, it was evident that
whatever it was possible to do for the preservation of the party,
by cutting wood for fires and preparing their scanty meals of
animal refuse, would have to be done by Franklin and his two
English companions. The three Canadians were all of them too weak
to move. Adam, the interpreter, had been for some time disabled,
and Peltier and Semandr&eacute; were now equally helpless. Both
complained of sore throats, produced by the acridity of the bone
soup, and Semandr&eacute; had the cramp in his fingers. The
former felt the cold extremely piercing in his reduced state of
body, and half a blanket was served out to him to repair his
flannel shirt and drawers, which occupation, observes Franklin
quaintly, 'afforded some amusement to him and Semandr&eacute; in
the evening and revived their spirits.' But on November 2 the end
came. On the morning of that day both men were obviously at the
point of death. Peltier sat up with difficulty and looked
piteously, exclaiming frequently, "Je suis faible! Je suis
faible!" and spoke often of the increased soreness of his throat.
At length he slid down from the spot on which he was sitting on
to his bed, which was placed near the fire, as if to sleep, and
remained for two hours without our apprehending him to be in
immediate danger, until we were alarmed by hearing a rattling
noise in his throat. On Dr. Richardson examining him he was found
to be speechless.' It was the speechlessness of death.
Semandr&eacute; lingered through the day, complaining always of
increasing cold and weakness, and expired at daylight on the
following morning. Dr. Richardson and Hepburn removed the two
men's bodies from the room, 'but were quite unable either to
inter them or carry them down to the water.'</p>
<p>Still, they remained the strongest of the four men to whom the
party was now reduced; for Franklin, with his customary candour,
admits that they had 'outstayed' him, and that during these last
days the task of wood-cutting devolved wholly upon them, Franklin
himself having only just strength enough to hunt for deerskins
under the snow. After another two days, however, the strength
even of the indefatigable pair began rapidly to decline. Yet,
their leader adds, 'they were full of hope, and went to their
labour of gathering wood cheerfully'. But on Tuesday, November 6,
it became evident that they were on the verge of absolute
exhaustion. 'To cut one log of wood is an occupation for half an
hour to Hepburn, and to carry it into the house occupied
Richardson almost the same time, though the distance does not
exceed twenty yards. I endeavoured to render the men some
assistance in this employment, but my aid was feeble. It is
evident, however,' continues Franklin, with a rebound of his
marvellously elastic spirits, 'that if their strength diminishes
with the rapidity it has done for the last three days, I shall be
the strongest in a day or two.'</p>
<p>With this last utterance of an inexhaustible courage this last
manifestation of a pride of endurance which had no doubt been not
a little wounded by his companions superiority in physical
strength, the long-drawn tale of suffering fitly closes. On the
following day relief came. The manner of its arrival is described
in Franklin's published narrative of the expedition; but an
infinitely more touching record of it can just be deciphered on
the soiled and dogs-eared page of the little paper-covered pocket
journal that lies before me. Regularly, religiously, day by day
throughout that grim struggle with death, its entries follow one
another with methodical precision, and in the dim, blurred
pencil-marks that record that heartfelt cry of thanksgiving on
the page which has here been reproduced in facsimile one almost
seems to be listening to the faint and broken utterances of the
famine-stricken and almost dying man. On Sunday, November 4, he
had written, so far as it is possible to decipher the entry:</p>
<blockquote>May the devout prayers of the congregations on behalf
of the afflicted find . . . before the Throne of
Mercy.</blockquote>
<p>Then follows, on the page which has been reproduced, an
account of the incidents of the two following days&mdash;of their
failure to discover any <i>tripe de roche</i> or bones; of their
meal off fried skins and tea; of the increasing weakness of the
Doctor and Hepburn: 'eats little, and was getting this day quite
dispirited.' And then at the bottom of the page:</p>
<blockquote>Wednesday, Nov. 7.&mdash;Praise be unto the Lord! We
were this day rejoiced by the appearance of Indians with supplies
at noon.</blockquote>
<p>The trembling hand that penned these now barely legible lines
is long since dust; and the dingy and crumpled little book that
contains them would, but for the pious care which has preserved
it, have perished years ago. But it was found among certain
papers sealed and described in its owner's handwriting as 'The
Original Notes of Capt. Franklin, written during the most
distressing part of his last residence at Fort Enterprise in
1821&mdash;much defaced by being worn in his pocket'; and it has,
of course, been cherished as among the most sacred of their
possessions by his relatives. Nor is it possible, even for those
who can only claim the kinship with him of a common humanity, to
look unmoved upon this silent companion and daily confidant of a
hero throughout the long agony of his fight with famine.</p>
<p class="poem">Sunt lacrym&aelig; rerum et mentem mortalia

<p>Dull indeed must be the imagination that does not feel its
pathos, and sluggish the sympathies that it fails to stir.</p>

[2]</small></p>
<br>
<p>It was to the gallant and devoted Back that they owed their
lives. His sufferings since he separated from the party on
October 4 had been no less severe than theirs. For days together
he and the three men with him had supported life 'on an old pair
of leather trousers, a gun-cover, and a pair of old shoes, with a
little <i>tripe de roche</i> that they succeeded in scraping off
the rocks.' On the 26th, one of his companions died of
exhaustion; but the survivors, knowing that the lives of the
party they had left behind them depended on their exertions,
still pressed on. On November 4 they fell in with Akaitcho and
his Indians, and at once despatched them to Fort Enterprise to
Franklin's relief. The supplies they brought with them consisted
of some dried deer's meat and a few tongues, on which the
sufferers would have fallen like famished wolves had it not been
for the warnings of Dr. Richardson. Yet never perhaps was the
well-known admonition, 'Do as I say, but not as I do'&mdash;that
soundest counsel of the professional adviser, alike in medicine
and in morals&mdash;more amusingly illustrated; for Franklin
admits in his official narrative that Richardson was himself
'unable to practise the caution he so judiciously recommended',
and there is evidence in their private journals that the Doctor
suffered more severely from distension than any other member of
the party.</p>
<p>The Indians, to do them justice, endeavoured to the best of
their ability to atone for their so nearly fatal neglect. The
interpreter Adam, who was undoubtedly within a few hours of death
when the relief arrived, owed his speedy convalescence to their
attentive care; and they did their utmost, by procuring game and
fish, and in other ways, to minister to the wants of the whole of
the exhausted party. In little more than another week, so
wonderful is man's recuperative power, their energies were
sufficiently restored to enable them to proceed. On November 16
they quitted the station which had been the scene of their
miseries, and on the 11th of the following month they reached
Fort Providence. Hence, after resting a few days, they went on to
Moose Deer Island, where they passed the remainder of the winter.
On May 26, 1822, they started homeward, and, reaching York
Factory about the middle of July, took ship for England, where
they arrived in October, after an absence of three years and a
half and journeyings by land and water of more than 5,500
miles.</p>
<p>Very shortly after their arrival, Franklin, who had in his
absence been promoted to the rank of commander, was advanced to
that of post-captain, and was about the same time unanimously
elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, in recognition of his
services to the cause of geographical science. Those services, it
is true, had been considerable, and well deserved the rewards,
official and unofficial, which they had won. But the debt of the
English nation&mdash;nay, of the whole human race&mdash;to the
heroic explorers was far greater than that of the geographer; and
the shores of the Coppermine River, the Barren Lands of Arctic
America, and the rude shelter of Fort Enterprise, are sacred and
memorable in human history, not as the mere monuments of a
scientific conquest, but as the scene of labours and sufferings
which have inspired the world with a new conception of the powers
of human endurance, a new glory in the unconquerable soul of
man.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<p align="center">HUSBAND AND WIDOWER<br>
<br>
1822-1825</p>
<p><small>IN</small> the first quarter of the present century the
position of a 'lion' was not to be so cheaply won as it is now,
nor, even when recognised as such, was the noble animal pursued
by nearly as many hunters or with anything like the amount of
spirit as is the case to-day. Franklin's exploits, however, even
apart from their gallantry and hardihood, were of too novel and
picturesque a character not to create a sensation even among the
comparatively sedate public of 1822. There is abundant evidence
at this period of his life that he had become a conspicuous
figure in London society, a welcome guest at many dinner-tables,
an object of interest and admiration in many drawing-rooms.
Doubtless he received notice and courtship enough to have turned
the head of any less modest and simple-minded man; but Franklin
was in no danger of being thus spoilt. He was, indeed, protected
from any such danger, not only, as has been said, by his modesty,
but also by his ambition. There is, perhaps, no more effectual
safeguard against undue vanity over past achievements than an
ardent desire to add greater exploits to their number. The
honourable discontent which such a desire, until gratified,
generates is essentially antagonistic to that mood of mind in
which alone complacency can flourish; and the passion for Arctic
discovery gave Franklin no rest. Immediately on his arrival in
England he set to work to prepare that well-written and spirited
narrative of his expedition which has been so frequently quoted
above, and which was, in fact, published by Mr. Murray in the
following year.</p>
<p>It must have been while he was engaged in preparing this
volume for publication that he received the letter above referred
to from the father of the unfortunate young man who had fallen a
victim to the murderous impulse of the half-insane Indian,
Michel; and Franklin's reply to it is so eminently illustrative
of his genuine kindness of heart that it deserves quotation
almost in full. The elder Hood, in the postscript of a pathetic
letter of thanks to Franklin for the terms in which he had spoken
of his murdered comrade in the official despatch reporting the
circumstances of his death, appends a question respecting 'what
perhaps the dreadful circumstances of the moment scarcely
permitted', namely, the interment of his son's remains. 'May I
trouble you', he adds, 'to inform me what time he first began to
be ill, and whether in your opinion, if that infernal villain had
not perpetrated his shocking crime, he might probably have
survived until the period of relief?'</p>
<p>In his reply to this letter, Franklin, after dwelling upon the
excellent qualities of the ill-fated young officer,
proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>You will, therefore, readily imagine I looked with
painful solicitude at the possibility of losing such a valuable
member of our small society, which, I lament to say, was too
awfully apparent at the time of my arrival at Fort Enterprise,
when I experienced the indescribable disappointment of finding
the house destitute of provisions. On my separation from your
son, he remarked that he never should be able to move the
distance of our house [from where he then was], about thirty-six
miles, without being drawn on a sledge. I think, however, his
strength was then sufficient to have gone two or three days
further at an easy pace; but then, in all probability, he must
have halted, as by going on we advanced into a country where the
soil was sandy and lichens&mdash;our only food at the
time&mdash;were less abundant. This unpalatable nourishment,
however, from which the others derived some degree of support,
was seldom taken by him, save in the smallest quantity, on
account of the constant irritation which the eating of it
produced in his bowels. He might, too, as were others far
stronger in appearance, have been completely exhausted in the
following day's march by the increased exertions required to wade
through the deeper snow we came to. He had been in a very weakly
state upwards of a month preceding his death, and I am informed
by Dr. Richardson and Hepburn that at the time when the
ever-to-be-deplored crime was committed by Michel the afflicted
sufferer was in such a perfectly debilitated state of body that
he could scarcely walk twenty yards without support. Under such
circumstances, it was to be feared that his earthly career would
have terminated in a short time had not the awful event taken
place&mdash;especially as it would have been totally out of my
power to have sent relief immediately forward on its reaching me
at Fort Enterprise on November 7, owing to the few persons with
me at the house being almost in a similar deplorably weak
condition.</blockquote>
<p>To the other, the more difficult and distressing question put
to him, Franklin replies, and doubtless could only reply very
little; but that little is put with much tact and good
feeling:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>With respect to the interment of his body, I am
certain the strength of the survivors was inadequate to the
labour of opening a sufficient space of the perfectly frozen
ground; but I have little doubt of their having covered the body
with snow and stones. Dr. Richardson, however, will be able to
give you information on that point.</blockquote>
<p>And the letter concludes with the following testimony to
Franklin's affectionate regard for his lost comrade:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Among the last conversations which I had with your
excellent son Robert, he mentioned his brother to me, and
particularly requested I would endeavour to find him out and
cultivate his friendship. He spoke most highly of his talents and
application, and he did me the kindness to request, if ever I
should be employed on any other expedition, that he might
accompany me. With this, his last request, I should feel it a
peculiar pleasure in complying, providing it should meet your and
his brother's wish. At least, I beg you to be assured that I
shall seek the earliest opportunity of meeting your surviving
son, and be desirous to show by every act in my power how
sincerely I wish to extend to him the friendship I entertained
for his departed brother.</blockquote>
<p>Not much addition is needed to this picture: the young
officer, at the point of death from starvation in the Arctic
wilderness, anxiously soliciting employment for his brother in
the same dangerous service, and his leader conveying the proposal
of this opening for 'your surviving son' to the bereaved father,
with perfect confidence in his assumption that the offer, whether
accepted or not, will be welcome. They were a Spartan race, the
Englishmen of those days. May their descendants prove worthy of
them!</p>
<p>But the enthusiasm which Franklin thus confidently attributed
to the father of his murdered comrade was not more ardent, after
all, than the passion which glowed within his own breast. If it
did not occur to him that bereavement could discourage it in
another, it was because he was conscious that the last
extremities of danger and suffering had not one whit diminished
it in himself. Less than a year had gone by since he was
undergoing one of the most appalling trials of human fortitude
that man has ever endured and survived. He had passed through
experiences which would have seemed to many a man sufficient for
a lifetime, nay, which may almost be said to have compressed the
agonies of a lifetime into a few terrible weeks. Who could have
wondered if his sole desire had been for long repose and for a
gradual release from hideous recollections hovering around his
pillow in nightmares of horror-haunted dream? Yet nothing could
have been further from the actual fact. The man who, in the
winter of 1821, had been starving upon acrid lichens and putrid
offal in the Arctic wilds was actually again exploring those
deadly regions in imagination in the summer of 1822. Such leisure
as was left him by the preparation of the Narrative he employed,
not in contemplating his past triumphs, but in planning future
conquests. Even in this very year we find him making proposals to
the Admiralty for a new expedition to the coasts of Arctic
America by a somewhat different route.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these pre-occupations of his were not so
absorbing as to exclude another of a very important kind. Even
the busiest of men contrive somehow to find the leisure necessary
for falling in love, and still more for prosecuting the courtship
which is the natural sequel to that incident. There are reasons
for thinking that the first step&mdash;if a 'fall' can be so
described&mdash;had been taken by Franklin several years before.
It is, at any rate, highly significant that to a small group of
islands discovered by his expedition in the Arctic Sea he should
have given the name of the Porden Islands. Flinders, and Buchan,
and Hood, who stood sponsors for the newly discovered capes, or
bays, or rivers, of those latitudes, can at once be identified as
former commanders or present comrades. But there was no member of
the expedition bearing the name given to these islands, whereas
there was a certain Miss Eleanor Anne Porden, the daughter of an
eminent architect, and with some considerable reputation as a
poetess, who had celebrated the earlier voyage of the Dorothea
and Trent in an admiring sonnet. Not only so, but after making
Franklin's acquaintance, probably in her capacity as the
sonneteer, she addressed to him a short poem, the authorship of
which was no doubt made known to him, though veiled from the
public under the name of 'Green Stockings'. The lines are
supposed to be addressed by an Eskimo girl to the adventurous
Englishman, and begin as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">Yes, yes, thou art gone to the climes of the
East;<br>
    Thou hast welcomed the sun as he springs from the sea,<br>
And thou car'st not, though sorrow lie cold on my breast,<br>
    Though the night of the grave may be closing on me.<br>
And though he may beam in those changeable skies,<br>
Where he dawns but to set, and descends but to rise,<br>
Though on wonders I dream not his lustre may shine,<br>
Yet he warms not one bosom more constant than mine.<br>
<br>
And what if the daughters of Albion be fair,<br>
    With their soft eyes of azure and tresses of gold?<br>
To the flow'rs of the meadows their charms I compare;<br>
    They bloom in the sunshine, but shrink from the cold.<br>
But I through the snow and the forest would guide thee,<br>
On the smooth-frozen lake I would gambol beside thee;<br>
With thongs of the reindeer thy buskins would weave,<br>
And dress thy light meal as thou slumber'st at eve.<br>
<br>
But frown not; thou knowest that such moments have been,<br>
    Though cruel and false, thou could'st calmly depart.<br>
Thy comrade too truly has pictured the scene<br>
    And my form: but thine own, it is drawn on my heart.<br>
Think not in thy green isle some fair one to view,<br>
For with tempest and storm shall my vengeance pursue.<br>
My bidding at noonday shall darken the air,<br>
And the rage of my climate shall follow thee there.</p>
<p>And thus the love-smitten 'Green Stockings'
concludes:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">Return! and the ice shall be swept from thy
path;<br>
    I will breathe out my spells o'er the land and the sea.<br>
Return! and the tempest shall pause in his wrath,<br>
    Nor the winds nor the waves dare be rebels to thee.<br>
<br>
Spread thy canvas once more, keep the Pole Star before thee,<br>
'Tis constancy's type and the beacon of glory;<br>
By the lake, by the mountain, the forest and river,<br>
In the wilds of the North, I am thine, and for ever!</p>
<p>As will be perceived, it is eminently in the taste of the
time&mdash;a time, it need hardly be added, in which English
minor poetry was not at its best. But Miss Porden's intellectual
abilities would be unfairly measured by her power of expressing
her thoughts and emotions in a language which but few, and they
of the highest poetic genius, had at that time mastered, though
it is in these days handled with comparative ease and fluency
even by many who have neither thought nor emotion to express. One
would prefer not to judge her even by her epic poem in two
volumes entitled 'C&oelig;ur de Lion'; though the fact that she
wrote a 'scientific poem' called 'The Veils', which procured her
the unusual honour of being elected a member of the French
Institute, is enough to prove that, whatever the form of her
poetic utterances, she must have had considerable clearness of
mental vision and even some vigour of mental grasp. A far better
estimate, however, can be formed of her from the letters from
which some extracts will be given hereafter, and which show her
to have possessed a most alert intelligence, a keen eye for
character and situation, and no inconsiderable fund of
humour.</p>
<p>Franklin's wooing of this lady was no long business. They
became engaged to each other in the summer of 1823, and in August
19 they were married. It was in every respect save one&mdash;but
that unfortunately a most important respect&mdash;a happy union.
Mrs. Franklin's health, always very delicate, began to fail
rapidly within a year after the marriage. The fatal signs of
pulmonary disease revealed themselves, and it soon became too
sadly evident that the young wife's days were numbered. In the
early months of their wedded life, however, the gravity of her
case was not apparent. Franklin, writing to one of his sisters in
December 1823, describes her merely as 'somewhat of an invalid',
and at that time, probably, her happiness was unclouded by any
apprehensions. How thorough a sympathy existed between them he
goes on to show; for, after speaking of the steps which he had
then just taken to procure the despatch of another Arctic
expedition, he continues: 'All my proceedings in this matter have
been made with the entire concurrence and indeed assistance of my
wife, who, you are aware, is as warm in the cause of Arctic
discoveries as I can possibly be. Her mind, indeed, is so
thoroughly English that she would cheerfully make any sacrifice
to promote our national character, and more particularly where my
professional fame is concerned.' Little could he have foreseen at
that moment how great would be the sacrifice actually required of
her, and with what fortitude and devotion it would be met.</p>
<p>The nature of his plans could not, he adds, be communicated to
his correspondent at the present stage, but he promised her that
she and the rest of his family should receive the earliest
intelligence respecting them if they were sanctioned and likely
to be adopted. The scheme proposed by him, which was as a matter
of fact accepted by the authorities at the Admiralty, differed
from that of the former expedition in that the projected route of
approach to the Arctic Ocean was to be by way not of the
Coppermine, but of the Mackenzie River. On reaching its mouth the
party were to divide, one portion of it proceeding along the
coast to the westward, while the remainder took an eastward
course along it as far as the Coppermine River, so as to connect
the new survey of the North American shore with the discoveries
of the earlier exploration. Concurrently with the despatch of
these two land parties it was decided, as in the former case, to
send out a naval expedition also; but in this instance the
programme of 1819 was to be reversed. The vessel commissioned for
the service, H.M.S. Blossom, under the command of Captain
Beechey, Franklin's old lieutenant on the Trent, was to enter the
Arctic Ocean not as did Parry's vessel from the eastward by way
of Baffin's Bay, but through Behring Strait on the west; and it
was to aim at effecting a junction with Franklin's westward-bound
coasting party at some point between that strait and the mouth of
the Mackenzie River. In the event of such junction being
effected, the Blossom was to convey him and his party either to
Canton or the Sandwich Islands, as might seem advisable, or to
carry out any other instructions Franklin might think proper to
issue.</p>
<p>Many months, however, had yet to elapse before the
preparations for the departure of the two expeditions were
completed. For Franklin of course they were months full of
business, involving probably not a little separation from his
young wife, whose health was already beginning to decline, and
who in the spring of 1824 was expecting the birth of her first,
and, as it proved to be, her only child. Several letters from her
to her sisters-in-law during this period have been
preserved&mdash;letters which testify abundantly to the bright
liveliness of her temperament, yet are not without a pathetic
interest of their own. Incidentally they show the keen public
interest which the new project of Arctic exploration had aroused,
and the more vigorous 'lionising' to which Franklin was being
subjected in consequence. 'I am much better than I have been',
writes his wife to her sister-in-law, under the light of one of
those delusive gleams of hope which so cruelly mock the victims
of consumption, 'and begin to be a little more useful about the
house; but I do not get out yet either on my own legs or any
other, and my cough is often extremely troublesome. I have been
flattered from week to week with the promise of a wonderful
change in me; but hitherto it has been all flattery. I am not
very ill, however, and I shall do very well with the help of a
little patience. Your brother is very kind and takes great care
of poor little me, so that I have not been dull after all, and my
friends are now beginning to rally round me. I only wish they
would suspend their invitations a little while till I am able to
accept and enjoy them.'</p>
<p>The cheerful courage with which the frail and failing woman
looks forward to a prospect which had evidently disturbed the
composure of her correspondent comes out very strikingly in the
following passage:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I perceive the idea of your brother's engaging in
another expedition has quite frightened you, and you will set me
down as either having no feeling or not caring a straw for him
because I cannot share in your fears. I am, however, better off
than I had expected to be, for I always looked to his leaving me
this spring, and now I shall have his society nearly a
twelvemonth longer&mdash;time enough for us to get tired of each
other according to some people's opinion, but I see no signs of
such an event at present. I think I can venture to assure you
that, so far as human calculation can extend or human prudence
can provide, there is no danger of his again encountering the
sufferings of his last journey. The fatigue and want of the
comforts of civilised life which must be inseparable from all
travels into uncolonised countries, he must of course be prepared
to meet, but I trust that he is endowed with every mental and
bodily requisite to surmount them; and what would you think of
any man who scrupled to encounter these inconveniences in the
path of duty and honour? . . . Let me beg of you, therefore, to
dismiss your apprehensions. If evil should come, it will come
soon enough. We have no occasion to cloud the present hour by
anticipating it; and should the enterprise be successful, I am
sure you love your brother too well not to wish that he may have
the happiness and honour of achieving it. At any rate, he is
still under the care of the same Providence which has once so
wonderfully sustained him, and, as I said before, every human
precaution will be taken.</blockquote>
<p>On June 3, 1824, Mrs. Franklin gave birth to a daughter, who
was christened Eleanor, after her mother. The event, as so often
happens in such cases, sensibly accelerated the progress of her
malady, and from that date, no doubt, the probability if not the
imminence of the fatal issue was no longer to be concealed from
the sufferer's husband and her friends.</p>
<p>Her own hopefulness, however, was invincible, and a letter of
hers of more than three months' later date from Tunbridge Wells
is quite touching in its vivacity and high spirits:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I am getting stout and well, and mean soon to be
strong enough to look better after your brother, and try to keep
him in some sort of order.</blockquote>
<p>(In an earlier letter she had written: 'I suppose the
newspapers have told you how the ladies pulled your brother to
pieces at Captain Parry's ball. He was in such request that I
wonder they left a bit of him for me.')</p>
<blockquote>Such a flirt as he is! The like was never known. Only
think of his being one of a party to gallant sixteen young ladies
(ladies are always young, you know), who, not contented with
making a monopoly of the carriages in the neighbourhood (so that
poor I, who was left at home, could hardly procure a wretched
one), actually stormed the house of a gentleman whom they did not
know, a few miles off, and insisted on eating their picnic meal
in his dining-room! John Bull grumbled a little at first, as
might be expected; but as John Bull is always good-natured at
bottom, and, moreover, easily taken in, he yielded at last at the
thought of these sixteen lovely damsels getting wet through in an
impending shower, at the doleful picture of coughs and colds
which was drawn by Lady Ellenborough's butler, for she was leader
of the storming party. Well, as I said, the poor gouty old
gentleman's heart was softened, and, what is more, his wife was
neither angry nor jealous. The young ladies were allowed to do as
they liked&mdash;namely, to make themselves quite at home on his
territory. So they wandered on the margin of his lake, which had
been the original attraction, and sang songs in his sylvan
avenues till the despairing nightingales dropped down dead with
envy, and the moon rose a full hour before the time to look at
what was going on. I understand your brother's sweetness of voice
and delicacy of taste were particularly admired in a tender
Italian duet with one of the Misses L. He has had a good deal of
practice lately in singing to baby, and were it not for the
approaching expedition I should expect to see him come out as a
successor to Braham.</blockquote>
<p>Then follows an amusing anecdote of another distinguished
man:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Mr. Chantrey, the sculptor, who has been residing
here some time, came down from London last Saturday, and on
Sunday discovered that he had left the keys of his cellar and
strong box behind. Nothing remained but to go back to London for
them. Monday morning came, all the coaches full, so what does he
do but order a post-chaise and set off! At Seven Oaks he finds a
gentleman in despair at being able to procure no conveyance to
town when he was summoned by earnest business; so Mr. Chantrey in
his generosity volunteers to take him on. So far, so good; but
half a mile further he found his keys in his breeches pocket,
and, being ashamed to tell the tale of his own folly, actually
went on to London for the sake of keeping faith with his
travelling companion. Men of genius do strange things. . . . Not
a word about baby yet! Not a word of sober common-sense! Well, I
can't help it. I have dealt in dismals so long that I am
determined not to be serious again until after your brother is
gone; nor then, either, if I can help it.</blockquote>
<p>No apology, it is to be hoped, is needed for these somewhat
lengthy extracts. The letters from which they are taken afford us
our only glimpse into the inner life of the bright and hapless
young creature over whom the grave was so soon to close. A
situation more intensely tragic than that in which Franklin was
placed at this moment it would be impossible to imagine. As the
date of his departure drew nearer and nearer, so also did it
become more and more evident that the hour was as fast
approaching when his beloved wife must herself begin, in words
destined years afterwards to be graven on his own cenotaph, her
'happier voyage, towards no earthly Pole.' It was plainly as much
a question of days with one event as with the other; and in this
grim race between Death and Duty the unhappy husband found
himself almost longing for the victory of the former, in order
that he might be with his wife to the end. The following letter
to his brother-in-law, Mr. Sellwood, written less than a week
before, reflects a state of feeling which would render it almost
too painful for extract, were not the distressing situation so
relieved and ennobled by the quiet heroism of the dying
woman:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Hannah's last letter to Mr. Booth will have apprised
you of my dearest Eleanor being in a very alarming state. The
disease has continued its rapid progress, and she is now to all
appearance nearly at her last extremity; but such has been her
muscular strength that she has rallied frequently, and it is not
improbable she may linger even through this day. I seize an
interval of repose to commence this letter to you in this room,
where I have been watching all the night. You, my dearest friend,
have experienced the awful trial I have got to witness, and can
fully enter into my feelings and truly condole with my
afflictions. Great as my loss must be, it is assuredly some
alleviation to reflect that it is possible it may please, the
Almighty to remove her from this transitory scene before I take
my departure, and, though short the time of my stay, I may have
the opportunity of arranging for the care of our dear infant. ...
It is impossible to imagine any person more resigned than she has
been, and is especially since the paroxysms have subsided. She
has desired me to pray for her in express words during the night,
and about three hours since asked me to read the chapter of
Corinthians used, for the funeral service. All her private
arrangements have been made with perfect calmness and
self-collection, and now her mind is perfectly at ease. She only
says 'God's will be done!' It is, too, extremely satisfactory to
me that she expressed before the whole party her decided wish
that I should not delay in going on the expedition, that it has
ever been her desire, and that she is not of opinion that the
circumstance of my going has hastened the crisis of her
complaint, which she now thinks has been long in progress, and
certainly advancing by rapid strides since our return from
Tunbridge Wells.</blockquote>
<p>The end, however, was not nearly so close at hand as appeared.
In a few hours the patient rallied. The doctors, Franklin
reported later, 'saw symptoms of amendment. Other measures were
immediately adopted. The medicine produced the effect looked for,
and I thank God my dearest wife has been since improving, and
that even now there are hopes of her recovery, faint as they may
be and as I shall consider them. She said to-day, "It would be
better for me that you were gone." It is delightful how happy the
state of her mind is.'</p>
<p>By the middle of the month of February the expedition was at
last ready to start. All the details connected with its equipment
had been personally superintended by Franklin, who also made the
necessary arrangements with the Hudson's Bay Company's officials
for the conveyance of his people, stores, and provisions to Great
Bear Lake. In accordance with his wishes, three boats were
specially constructed in such a manner as to combine
seaworthiness and stability with such lightness as should render
them sufficiently easy of transport over the numerous portages
and various rapids that would be met with before reaching the
Arctic waters on which they were to be launched. The largest of
these boats was twenty-six feet long, and was capable of carrying
eight people; the other two, each constructed to hold seven men,
were twenty-four feet in length. The two companions who had
played so gallant a part in Franklin's former adventure, Dr.
Richardson and Lieutenant Back, were again associated with him,
and Mr. Kendall, an officer who had served in Parry's last
expedition, and was afterwards to become Franklin's nephew by
marriage, was also of the party.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for the purpose of the present memoir to
give so detailed an account of this second expedition as has been
given of the first. Less dramatic in its incidents, and attended
with far less formidable difficulties and dangers, it is
proportionately less illustrative of the personal character and
qualities of its commander, and its results, though of high
scientific value, belong rather to the general history of
geographical exploration. Except, therefore, at those stages of
its course at which it is marked by occurrences bearing on the
history of Franklin's private life or throwing additional light
on his individuality, the narrative of it in these pages will
have to be more or less concisely summarised.</p>
<p>One such occurrence, however, and that of a tragic nature,
confronts us, as was indeed but too evidently and sadly
predestined, at its very outset. The officers of the expedition,
who had been preceded by the men and stores, left England on
February 16, 1825, and on the 22nd, less than a week after, Mrs.
Franklin breathed her last. It was not, however, until near the
end of April that the sorrowful news overtook her husband; and,
grave as had been the apprehensions with which he had left her,
the tidings came upon him&mdash;as all such tidings do, however
men may think themselves prepared for them&mdash;with an
overwhelming shock.</p>
<p>It was the more severe since it would seem that that pathetic
power of self-deception which love bestows had actually been
strong enough since Franklin's departure to revive in him hopes
of his wife's ultimate recovery. He wrote letter after letter to
Mrs. Franklin, then, alas! no more, which breathe, in many
passages at any rate, a spirit of confidence and even of
cheerfulness, which may of course have been partly, but could not
have been wholly, assumed. It was in this strain that he wrote to
her during his outward passage, a very pleasant and favourable
one as he describes it, in the American packet-ship Columbia. 'I
have every hope', he says, 'that it will please God to restore
you to health, and that we shall meet after the lapse of a few
short years to unite in thanksgiving and prayer to the Almighty,
and to enjoy each other's and our dear child's society.'</p>
<p>Again, on March 22, after his arrival at New York, he writes
describing the town in his usual lively fashion, and incidentally
gives us a glimpse of the interior of an American theatre of
those days. 'It is a neat house and happened to be well filled.
Some of the gentlemen, however, sat with their hats on in the
boxes by the side of the ladies. So much for a young country, and
for liberty and independence!' And the letter ends: 'I often
think how you and our little girl are getting on, and am always
so sanguine as to hope you are well. ... I long to hear from you,
and it is unfortunate that the next packet has not arrived, which
will no doubt bear letters from you or some one of the family.' A
third letter is from Albany, full of travelling incidents and
giving a description of the Falls of Niagara. And then comes the
last he ever wrote to her before learning the fatal truth. It was
written from Penentanguishene, a lonely outlying British station
on Lake Huron, and is dated April 22:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I am sure you will be rejoiced to learn that we
arrived safely at this place, to which you may remember a part of
our stores were forwarded from Montreal. The Canadian
<i>voyageurs</i> had not reached York Factory at the time of the
departure from thence. I therefore left Mr. Back to bring them
up. Part of these men have already come up, Mr. Back and the
remainder we expect to-day, so that we shall probably commence
our voyage this evening or to-morrow. We are first to cross Lake
Huron and Lake Superior, and at Fort William, on the north side
of the latter lake, we embark in the proper travelling canoes,
which are of a smaller size than those we now use.<br>
<br>
Penentanguishene is the most northerly of our naval stations, and
the key to Lake Huron. At the close of the war they were
preparing to build a frigate of thirty-two guns, but its
construction was deferred when the peace was concluded, and the
establishment was then reduced. We have found, however, very
comfortable quarters in the house of the lieutenant commanding.
There are a lieutenant of the army with his wife, and a surgeon
and his wife stationed here; these form a social party and cause
the time to pass very pleasantly . . . I do not think, however,
that either you or I would relish such a secluded life. If we
could convey our library, it would be the very place for me to
get through it.<br>
<br>
I should have rejoiced at having you by my side on our journey
from New York. There were many scenes which you could have
described so well, and I am sure it would have given you sincere
pleasure to have witnessed the industry of the American character
evinced by the number of the towns and villages which have sprung
up within a few years, and where there was every appearance of
prosperity and comfort. Many of the best-informed Americans whom
we met complain, and I think with justice, of the misstatements
that have been made of their country by English travellers,
though they comfort themselves with the reflection that the
greater part of these men are persons who in their own country
are considered as desperate adventurers, and who have in
consequence been excluded from good society. I certainly have no
partiality either for the Americans or for their Constitution,
but it is impossible not to admire their industry. . . .<br>
<br>
I was in hopes that before we left this place I should have
received a letter to inform me that you continued to improve. The
packet from Liverpool must have had a long passage to New York,
or I should have had that gratification. I shall embark, however,
with every hope that the Almighty has been pleased to restore you
to health before this, and that you are now in the enjoyment of
every comfort. I daily remember you and our dear little one in my
prayers, and I have no doubt yours are offered up on my behalf. .
. . She must be growing very entertaining, and I sincerely trust
she will be a source of great comfort to us, especially to you in
my absence. With what heartfelt pleasure shall I embrace you both
on my return! I suppose Captain Beechey has sailed before this
time, and hope that he will be the bearer of a letter from you or
from some of the family if you should have been unequal to
writing. . . . Your flag is yet snug in the box, and will not be
displayed till we get to a more northern region. Mr. Back and the
men have arrived.</blockquote>
<p>Here the letter breaks off abruptly, and then in an agitated
handwriting are added the words:</p>
<blockquote>Seven o'clock <small>P.M.</small> The distressing
intelligence of my dearest wife's death has just reached
me.</blockquote>
<p>This was actually the second letter which he had written that
very day in the same resolutely hopeful tone. Or, at any rate,
there is a letter of his of the same date&mdash;though it may
possibly have been penned by him in fact a day earlier, and left
open, as was the fashion in that age of rare and costly
communication, until the last moment before despatch, in order to
make it carry the very latest news&mdash;in which, writing to his
sister of his wife, then nearly two months in her grave, he
dwells on her prospects of recovery in that tone of hopefulness
to which fate and man's ignorance sometimes lend so terrible an
irony:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I had expected during our stay here to have received
the letters which Mrs. Kay and Hannah promised to write for some
days after my departure from London, to acquaint me as to the
state of Eleanor; but the packet appears to have had a long
passage from Liverpool, as they have not come to hand. I cherish
the hope that it hath pleased the Almighty to assist her with His
protection, and that she is now restored to health. The last days
of my stay at home were indeed sorrowful, and I thank the
Almighty for enabling me to support them, and that the morning of
my departure was brightened by the hope of my dear wife's
recovery. . . . The struggle which my dear Eleanor then had
convinced me that her health is very precarious, and that in
consequence she needs all the care and attention that my family
can give her during my absence.</blockquote>
<p>And this letter, too, concludes with the same sad
postscript:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Seven <small>P.M.</small> I have just received
through the newspaper an account of the death of my dearest
Eleanor. You can imagine my distress, as I had hoped from the
change which had taken place two days before my departure that
her life might have been spared. But it hath pleased the Almighty
in His wise dispensation to remove her from me, and I trust she
is now associated with the spirits of the just made perfect. I
feel deeply for my dearest child, though I know she will receive
from Isabella (Mrs Cracroft) a mother's anxious love, yet to a
tender female a mother's loss is irreparable. I earnestly pray
God to protect her, and that she may be brought up in His
love.</blockquote>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<p align="center">SECOND ARCTIC EXPEDITION<br>
<br>
1825-1827</p>
<p><small>PENENTANGUISHENE</small>, on Lake Huron, the place from
which these sorrowful letters are dated, is some 1,500 miles as
the crow flies from Fort Cumberland, the originally intended
rendezvous of the expedition, and on the day after it was written
Franklin and his party set off in two canoes which had been
deposited at that place in the preceding autumn. Following the
great north-westward-stretching chain of lakes&mdash;that is to
say, up Rainy Lake, the Lake of the Woods, and Lake
Winnipeg&mdash;and issuing thence into the Saskatchewan River,
they made their way to Fort Cumberland, which was reached on June
15. Here they learned that their boats, which had arrived before
them, had left on the 2nd of the month; and, accordingly, after
one night's stay at the fort, they proceeded on their voyage. On
June 29 they overtook the boats and the remainder of the party,
who had travelled <i>vi&acirc;</i> York Factory, and on July 15
they reached Fort Chipewyan, whence, after a stay of two days,
they pursued their way to Fort Resolution, on the Great Slave
Lake. At that station they remained a few days, making the
necessary arrangements with the Indians for the supply of
provisions for the winter, and August 2 saw them embarked in
their canoes on the Mackenzie River. Two days' journey down its
stream brought them to Fort Simpson, and yet another four days'
travel to Fort Norman. Here, as there still remained a few weeks
of the travelling season, the party, under Franklin's
instructions, divided. Back, accompanied by an officer of the
Hudson's Bay Company, was directed to proceed to Great Bear Lake,
and there to construct winter quarters for the expedition. Dr.
Richardson was despatched at his own request to explore the
northern shore of the lake; while Franklin himself, taking with
him Kendall, a crew of six Englishmen, a native guide, and his
old friend the Eskimo interpreter, started in one of the boats
for the mouth of the Mackenzie River, with the view of examining
the condition of the ice in the Arctic Ocean, and forming an
estimate of the prospects of a successful voyage along its shores
in the following year.</p>
<p>The parties separated on August 9, and so well was Franklin
served by the new English-built boat he had brought out with him,
that by the 14th of that month they had reached the Polar Sea.
Franklin had brought out with him a silk union-jack worked by his
dying wife, which, according to her wish, was not to be displayed
until her husband and his companions had gained the coast. That
moment having now arrived, he unfolded the flag and planted it on
the shore, and then that piquant mixture of qualities which goes
to the making of the typical sailor's nature comes out in his
characteristic comment on the incident. 'Here', he writes, 'was
first displayed the flag which my lamented Eleanor made, and you
can imagine it was with heartfelt emotion I first saw it
unfurled; but in a short time I derived great pleasure in looking
at it' All the affection of the husband speaks in one half of the
sentence, all the buoyant spirit of the born adventurer in the
other; while there is all the charm of Franklin's character in
the perfect simplicity and candour with which he combines the
revelation of the two. No one could have been less justly accused
of levity or shallowness of feeling; but he was of those with
whom sorrow, however profound and genuine, finds instant relief
in the thought of action, and it is by these, and perhaps by
these alone, that all the greater practical work of the world is
done.</p>
<p>By September 5 all three exploring parties had returned and
had established themselves in their winter quarters at Fort
Franklin, the station constructed by Back on Great Bear Lake, and
so named by him in compliment to his absent leader. The long
Arctic winter passed after its usual tedious fashion, diversified
by no incident of interest, but blessed for that very reason with
a good fortune akin to that of the nation which 'has no history.'
Despite the lowness of the temperature, which fell on one
occasion to 49&deg; below zero of Fahrenheit, or 81&deg; of
frost, they seemed to have suffered little from it, and the
supplies of game and fish procured for them by their Indian
hunters were fairly abundant. Writing to one of his sisters on
November 8 from Fort Franklin, he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>We are snugly seated in our winter quarters, the name
of which I am sure will please you. They form three sides of a
square, the centre house being occupied by the officers, the
buildings on its left by the men, and on its right is a store,
the whole surrounded by wooden stockades, which serve to keep the
drift away from the yard. Our house contains a spacious hall, and
on each side of it are two apartments which are fitted up
according to the taste and means of the occupiers. Dr. Richardson
and myself are in one of these, which is neatly whitewashed and
ornamented with books, instruments, clothes, and beds. The latter
are the principal features of elegance&mdash;mine in particular,
as Wilson, the piper, who is my servant, has fitted it up
<i>&agrave; la tente</i> with the lining of our marquee, and,
that no space may be lost, the interior is decorated with my
dirk, pistol, glass, cap, writing-case, and sash. My limbs repose
nightly on a well-stuffed bed, covered with leather, between
good, warm blankets, and, as you may suppose, I sleep soundly.
The season of darkness is daily advancing, and in the height of
winter we must not expect to have more than five hours' light, so
that we may have sleep to our hearts' content. We generally,
however, sit up till midnight, reading or employed otherwise, and
rise about eight o'clock, have our breakfast directly, dinner at
half-past five, and tea at nine. The evening is passed away often
in a game at chess or some sport, and the day devoted to
business. We are about to establish a school for the instruction
of the men; and on Sundays Divine Service with sermons is held
twice, and it is a real gratification to find the men joining on
these occasions with great fervency and attention.<br>
<br>
I sincerely pray, through the blessing of God, that these
opportunities of offering praise and thanksgiving to the
Almighty, and of hearing His Holy Word, may lead to our present
and eternal benefit. I wish to have the impression deeply seated
in my mind, as well as in those of my companions, that the
Almighty can alone support and help us in our present pursuits,
and that He ordereth each event of our lives. . . . You must not
suppose, my dear sister, from my writing in this manner that I am
gloomy; for I assure you that I am more calm, cheerful, and happy
than I have been for some time, and, indeed, than I expected to
have been under the severe trial I have had to sustain. I feel
the dispensations of the Almighty to have been appointed in
infinite wisdom, and, therefore, I pray for power to bear them
with humble resignation and reverence. Had my poor wife's life
been prolonged, I find it must have been attended with continual
and very acute suffering. Surely, then, the fondest desire of the
heart could not mourn beyond the first days of grief at her
removal from this weight of woe to a state of eternal
rest.</blockquote>
<p>To this same month of November 1825 belongs a letter from
Franklin to the eminent geologist, Mr. (afterwards Sir Roderick)
Murchison, in which he gives an interesting account of the fare,
occupations, and amusements, mental and physical, of the
imprisoned men:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>We have, as yet, had no severe weather, nor do I
think we are likely to have the temperature so low as at Fort
Enterprise. We are, in fact, much less elevated in this secondary
formation than when in its vicinity, where the rocks are entirely
granitic. Until the day before yesterday we had comparatively
little snow, and this is the first day that our dogs have been
used in dragging sledges. Four trains of two dogs each were
despatched for meat this morning. We endeavour to keep ourselves
in good humour, health, and spirits by an agreeable variety of
useful occupation and amusement. Till the snow fell the game of
hockey played on the ice was the morning's sport. At other times
Wilson's pipes are put in request, and now and then a game of
blind man's buff; in fact, any recreation is encouraged to
promote exercise and good feeling. I wish you could pop in and
partake our fare. You would be sure of a hearty welcome, and you
should have your choice of either moose, or reindeer, or trout
weighing from forty to fifty pounds. But you must bring wine and
bread if you wish either for more than one day.</blockquote>
<p>Nor were intellectual occupations of a graver, not to say of a
severe discipline wanting to the party, as will be seen from the
following passages, in which one notices, not without amusement,
that Franklin's criticisms of literary classics were marked in
his fortieth year by considerably more diffidence than he was
wont to display at the age of sixteen:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I have been delighted with Dante, and so have my
companions; but I must confess there is frequently a depth of
thought and reasoning to which my mind can hardly reach. Perhaps
these poets will be better comprehended in perusal. It seems
clear that Milton, as well as other poets, has borrowed ideas
from his comprehensive mind.</blockquote>
<p>It was not till June 24, 1826, that they were able to start on
their summer expedition, the plan of which was thus
arranged:&mdash;Franklin and Back were to explore the coast to
the westward of the mouth of the Mackenzie River, while Dr.
Richardson, accompanied by Mr. Kendall, was to make an eastward
journey from the same point to the mouth of the Coppermine River,
returning to Fort Franklin before the next winter set in, Mr.
Dease, an officer of the Hudson's Bay Company attached to the
expedition, remaining at that station to look after the supplies.
On July 3 the Franklin and Richardson parties separated at a
bifurcation of the Mackenzie River, and on the 7th the former
party reached its mouth. Here they met with what was perhaps the
solitary incident of their journey&mdash;an attack on the boats,
with a view to plunder, by a tribe of Eskimos some 300 strong. It
was subsequently ascertained that this attempt at pillage was
part of an organised plot to massacre the whole expedition; but
it was foiled by the cool courage and steady self-control of
Franklin and his men.</p>
<p>The affair seems, however, to have had at the outset a
sufficiently unpremeditated appearance. On arriving at the mouth
of the Mackenzie River, the expedition came somewhat unexpectedly
upon an Eskimo encampment&mdash;a crowd of tents pitched on an
island in the bay into which the river opened, and with many
Eskimos strolling about among them. Franklin immediately prepared
to open communications with them agreeably with his instructions.
A selection of articles for presents and trade being made, the
rest of the lading was closely covered up, the arms were
inspected, and every man was directed to keep his gun ready for
immediate use. Franklin had previously informed Back of his
intention to open communication with the Eskimos by landing among
them, accompanied only by Augustus, the interpreter; and Back was
now instructed to keep the boats afloat, and the crews with their
arms ready to support their leader in the event of the natives
proving hostile, but on no account to fire until he was convinced
that his safety could be secured in no other way. Having received
an impression from the narratives of different navigators that
the sacrifices of life which had occurred in these interviews
with savages had been generally occasioned by the crews mistaking
noise and violent gestures for decided hostility, Franklin
thought it advisable to explain his views on this point to all
the men, and peremptorily forbade their firing until he set the
example or until they were ordered to do so by Back. They were
also forbidden to trade with the natives on any pretence, and
were ordered to leave everything of that kind to the
officers.</p>
<p>On approaching the island the water became shallow, and the
boats grounded about a mile from the beach. The explorers shouted
and made signs to the Eskimos to come off, and then pulled back a
little way to await their arrival in deeper water. Three canoes
at once put off from the shore, and immediately afterwards others
were launched in such quick succession that the whole space
between the island and the boats was covered with them. Franklin
had counted as many as seventy-three, when the sea became so
crowded with them that he could proceed no further in his
reckoning. The three foremost canoes were paddled by elderly men,
apparently selected to open the communications. As soon as they
were within hail Augustus explained to them in detail the purport
of the visit, and told them that if his leader succeeded in
finding a navigable channel for large ships, a trade highly
beneficial to them would be opened. They were delighted with the
intelligence and repeated it to their countrymen, who testified
their joy by tossing their hands aloft and raising a deafening
shout of applause.</p>
<p>After the first present, Franklin resolved to bestow no more
gratuitously, but always to exact something, however small, in
return. The three elderly men readily offered the ornaments they
wore in their cheeks, their arms, and their knives in exchange
for the articles given them. Up to this time the first three
canoes alone had ventured near the boats, but the crowd soon
increased to 250 or 300 persons, all anxious to share in the
lucrative trade they saw established, and pressing eagerly
forward to offer for sale their bows, arrows, and spears, which
they had hitherto kept concealed within the canoes. Franklin
endeavoured in vain amid the clamour and bustle of barter to
obtain some information respecting the coast, but, finding the
natives becoming more and more importunate and troublesome, he
determined to leave them, and therefore directed the boats' heads
to be put to seaward.</p>
<p>Hitherto the Eskimos had shown no unfriendly disposition; but
at this juncture an accident happened which, in a quite
unforeseen fashion, altered the whole aspect of affairs. A canoe
being accidentally upset by an oar of one of the boats, its owner
was plunged into the water with his head in the mud, and
apparently in danger of being drowned. He was extricated from his
unpleasant position by the crew, and taken into the boat until
the water could be baled out of his canoe, Augustus throwing his
own great-coat over him, as he was shivering with cold. At first
he was exceedingly angry, but soon became reconciled to the
situation, and, looking about, discovered that the boat was full
of what he regarded as concealed treasures. He soon began to ask
for everything he saw, and expressed high displeasure at the
refusal of his demands. He proceeded, moreover, so to excite the
cupidity of his fellows by his account of the inexhaustible
riches contained in the boats, that several of the younger men
attempted to join him. While resisting the attempt, one of the
crew observed that the man who had been rescued from the mud had
a pistol under his shirt, and was about to take it from him, when
Franklin ordered his follower to desist, thinking that the weapon
might belong to him. It had, in fact, been stolen from Back, and
the thief, perceiving the attention directed to it, jumped out of
the boat and joined his countrymen, carrying with him Augustus's
great-coat.</p>
<p>The water had now ebbed so far that it was not knee-deep at
the boats, and the younger men wading in crowds around them
attempted to steal everything within their reach; slyly, however,
and with so much dexterity as almost to escape detection. This
mode of procedure, however, being found unsatisfactory, they
seized on the boat under Back's command, the Reliance, and set to
work to drag it ashore, upon which Franklin gave orders to his
own boat, the Lion, to follow it. But the Lion had stuck fast
aground and refused to move, on seeing which the Eskimos lent a
friendly hand, and both boats were dragged ashore.</p>
<p>This was the signal for an organised attempt to plunder them.
A numerous party stripped to the waist, and with drawn knives ran
to the Reliance, and, having hauled her up as they could, began a
regular pillage, handing the articles to the women, who, ranged
in a row behind them, quickly conveyed the thefts out of sight.
Back and his crew strenuously but good-humouredly resisted the
attack, and rescued many things from their grasp; but they were
overpowered by numbers, and had even some difficulty in
preserving their arms. Franklin and his crew were also beset,
though by smaller numbers, but by sitting tight on the covered
cargo, and belabouring the natives with the butt-ends of their
muskets, were able to prevent any article of importance from
being carried away. 'In the whole of this unequal contest,' says
Franklin, 'the self-possession of our men was not more
conspicuous than the coolness with which the Eskimos received the
blows dealt out to them with the butts of the muskets. But at
length, being irritated by the repeated failure of their
attempts, several of them jumped on board and forcibly
endeavoured to take the daggers and shot-belts from about the
men's persons.' Franklin himself was engaged with three of them
who were trying to disarm him, and was only just in time to
prevent one of his men from discharging the contents of his
musket into the body of an Eskimo who had struck at him with a
knife. In short, what had begun as a sort of half-friendly
rough-and-tumble 'bear fight', complicated with petty larceny,
was now threatening to develop into a massacre, when suddenly the
whole of the Eskimos took to flight and hid themselves behind the
canoes and drift timber on the beach. It appeared that, the
Reliance having been again got afloat Back wisely judged that the
moment had arrived for more active interference, and ordered his
men to level their muskets, which had produced this sudden panic.
Happily, the Lion floated soon after, and both were retiring from
the beach when the Eskimos, having recovered from their
consternation, launched their canoes and were preparing to
follow, but Franklin desired Augustus to say that he would shoot
the first man who came within range of his musket, upon which
they halted.</p>
<p>The scuffle had lasted for several hours, but with such spirit
had the contest been waged on Franklin's side that the only
things of any importance which the natives succeeded in carrying
off were the mess canteen and kettles, a tent, a box containing
blankets and shoes, one of the men's bags, and the jibsails. The
rest of their booty could well be spared, and the articles of
which it consisted would in fact have been distributed among them
if they had remained quiet. In concluding his account of the
affair Franklin writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I cannot sufficiently praise the fortitude and
obedience of both boats' crews in abstaining from the use of
their arms. In the first instance I had been influenced by the
desire of preventing unnecessary bloodshed, and afterwards, when
the critical situation of my party might well have warranted me
in employing more decided means for their defence, I still
endeavoured to temporise, being convinced that so long as the
boats lay aground and we were beset by such numbers armed with
long knives, bows and arrows, and spears, we could not use
firearms to advantage. The howling of the women and the clamour
of the men proved the high excitement to which they had wrought
themselves; and I am still of opinion that, mingled as we were
with them, the first blood we had shed would have been instantly
revenged by the sacrifice of all our lives.</blockquote>
<p>His methods undoubtedly were very different from those of the
modern explorer, who, even if he had hesitated from prudential
motives to fire on the Eskimos while surrounded by them, would in
all probability have returned the next morning and 'read them a
lesson' from a safe distance with Remington rifles.</p>
<p>This episode at an end, the expedition was at last able on
July 14 to take the sea, unobstructed at any rate by human
obstacles. But icebergs now took the place of Eskimos, and for
four or five days longer they were condemned to inaction. At the
expiration of this time the ice cleared sufficiently to permit a
passage for their boats, and they were able to push on. But their
progress was disappointingly slow. The favourable promise of
navigation which the Arctic Ocean had held out the previous year
proved wholly delusive. Their way was continually being barred by
ice, sometimes for days together; they were frequently delayed by
gales and fogs, and their boats were sadly knocked about by
floating ice-blocks, from which they sustained considerable
damage. On July 27 they reached what Franklin describes as the
most westerly river in the British dominions, as it was close to
the (of course imaginary) line of demarcation between Great
Britain and Russia, in those days, it will be remembered,
mistress of Alaska. This river Franklin named the Clarence, 'in
honour of His Royal Highness the Lord High Admiral. Under a pile
of drift timber which we erected on the most elevated point of
the coast near its mouth was deposited a tin box containing a
royal silver medal, with an account of the proceedings of the
expedition, and the Union flag was hoisted under three hearty
cheers, the only salute that we could afford.'</p>
<p>At this point they found more open water than they had yet met
with, and their spirits accordingly rose. Not, however, for long,
for their difficulties recommenced almost immediately, and
reached their climax at a spot which they vindictively christened
Foggy Island. It is a question, indeed, whether the partial
failure of their enterprise was not more due to fogs than ice;
for the prevalence of the former obstacle lost them many of the
precious days in which they might possibly have managed to
overcome or rather circumvent the other. Nothing was more
remarkable than the difference of conditions which had prevailed
in this respect between the present and Franklin's former
expedition. 'We were only', he says, 'detained three times in
navigating along the coast in 1821 to the east of the Coppermine
River; but westward of the mouth of the Mackenzie hardly a day
passed that the atmosphere was not at some time or other so foggy
as to hide any object from view for a distance of four or five
miles.' It was no doubt due, as Franklin suggests, not only to
the swampy character of the land, but to the Rocky Mountains
preventing its moisture from being carried off.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, and in spite of all obstructions, whether of fog
or ice, the expedition struggled gallantly on, until at length,
on August 18, after having traced the coast line for 374 miles,
Franklin came with much reluctance to the conclusion that it
would be imprudent to pursue their journey further. The autumn
was wearing on, and as yet they had only traversed half the
distance between the mouth of the Mackenzie and Icy Cape. At the
same rate of speed it would take them at least another six weeks
to make that headland, and by that time the winter would be
setting in and Captain Beechey, with whom Franklin was
endeavouring to effect a junction, would in all likelihood have
put the Blossom about and be sailing southward. Beechey, as it
happened, was at this very moment off Icy Cape, the furthest
point of his voyage, and had despatched a boat to the eastward to
look out for Franklin's party. This boat arrived on August 2$
within little more than 160 miles of the point at which Franklin
a week before had resolved to turn back. Tantalising, however, as
was this near approach which failed to become a meeting, it would
not have been possible for the two parties to meet. Franklin
could not have covered the intervening distance between August 18
and 25, and he and his men therefore could not have arrived at
the 'furthest' of the Blossom's boat before it returned to the
ship. As it was, he of course knew nothing of the despatch of
this boat. He had simply to weigh the probability of his own
expedition being able to effect a junction with the Blossom
herself during the short remaining period of the travelling
season. And this question he was, of course, bound to consider by
the light of his previous and terrible experiences, and of the
knowledge gained therefrom of the climate, the food supply, and
the reasonable weather forecasts for the time of the year.</p>
<p>The decision which he arrived at was so important, and the
abandonment of his hope of joining hands with Beechey and thus
completing the exploration of the entire American coast from the
Mackenzie westward to Behring Strait was so bitter a
disappointment, that it seems best to allow Franklin to state his
reasons for his resolution in the words of his own 'Narrative of
a Second Expedition to the Shores of the Polar Sea':&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The preceding narrative shows the difficulties of
navigating such a coast even during the finest part of the
summer; if, indeed, any portion of a season which had been marked
by a constant succession of gales and fogs could be called fine.
No opportunity of advancing had been let slip after the time of
our arrival in the Arctic Sea; and the unwearied zeal and
exertion of the crews had been required for an entire month to
explore the ten degrees of longitude between Herschel Island and
our present situation. I had, therefore, no reason to suppose
that the ten remaining degrees could be navigated in much less
time. The ice, it is true, was now broken up and the sea around
our present encampment was clear; but we had lately seen how
readily the drift ice was packed upon the shoals by every breeze
of wind blowing towards the land. The summer, bad as it had been,
was now nearly at an end. And on this point I had the experience
of the former voyage for a guide. At Point Turnagain, two degrees
to the south of our present situation, the comparatively warm
summer of 1821 terminated on August 17 by severe storms of wind
and snow; and in the space of a fortnight afterwards winter set
in with all its severity. Last year, too, on the 18th and
following days of the month, we had a heavy gale at the mouth of
the Mackenzie, and appearances did not indicate that the present
season would prove more favourable. The mean temperature of the
atmosphere had decreased rapidly since the sun had begun to sink
below the horizon, and the thermometer had not lately shown a
higher temperature than 37&deg;. Ice of considerable thickness
formed in the night, and the number of flocks of geese which were
hourly seen pursuing their course to the westward showed that
their autumnal flight had commenced.<br>
<br>
While a hope remained of reaching Behring Strait, I looked upon
the hazard to which we had on several occasions been exposed of
shipwreck on the flats or on the ice as inseparable from a voyage
of the nature of that which we had undertaken; and if such an
accident had occurred, I should have hoped, with a sufficient
portion of the summer before me, to conduct my party in safety
back to the Mackenzie. But the loss of the boats, when we should
have been far advanced, and at the end of the season, would have
been fatal. The deer hasten from the coast as soon as the snow
falls; no Eskimos had lately been seen, nor any winter houses to
denote that this part of the coast was much frequented; and if we
did meet them under adverse circumstances we could not with
safety trust to their assistance for a supply of provisions; nor
do I believe that, even if willing, they would have been able to
support us for any length of time.<br>
<br>
Till our tedious detention at Foggy Island we had had no doubt of
ultimate success; and it was with no ordinary pain that I could
now bring myself even to think of relinquishing the great object
of my ambition, and of disappointing the flattering confidence
that had been reposed in my exertions. But I had higher duties to
perform than the gratification of my own feelings; and a mature
consideration of all the above matters forced me to the
conclusion that we had reached that point beyond which
perseverance would be rashness and our best efforts must be
fruitless. . . .<br>
<br>
In the evening I communicated my determination to the whole
party; they received it with the good feeling that had marked
their conduct throughout the voyage, and they assured me of their
cheerful acquiescence in any order I should give. The readiness
with which they would have prosecuted the voyage was the more
creditable because many of them had their legs swelled and
inflamed from continually wading in ice-cold water while
launching the boats. . . . Nor were these symptoms to be
overlooked in coming to a determination; for though no one who
knows the resolute disposition of the British sailor can be
surprised at their more than willingness to proceed, I felt that
it was my business to judge of their capability for so doing, and
not to allow myself to be seduced by their ardour, however
honourable to them and cheering to me.</blockquote>
<p>Had Franklin known, he added, that a party from the Blossom
had been at the distance of only 160 miles from him, 'no
difficulties, dangers, or discouraging circumstances should have
prevailed on him to return'; but, taking into account the
uncertainty of all voyages in a sea obstructed by ice, he had no
right to expect that the Blossom had got so far eastward from
Behring Strait as the point which she had actually attained,
still less that any party from her had got to a point which, as a
matter of fact, in an attempt to repeat the feat the next summer,
their boat failed to reach by 100 miles. Anyhow, the decision to
return was taken and acted upon, and never in his life perhaps
did Franklin display truer and finer moral courage than when,
despite his burning zeal for discovery and his not unworthy
thirst for fame as an explorer, he thus unhesitatingly laid aside
his ambitions and quietly accepted disappointment.</p>
<p>They were back again at Fort Franklin by September 21 and were
rejoiced to find that the eastward expedition had been perfectly
successful, having traced nearly 900 miles of undiscovered
coast-line between the Mackenzie and Coppermine Rivers, and
regained the station on Great Bear Lake full three weeks before
the return of Franklin's party. In the course of their
exploration they had discovered a large bay, which they had named
after their distinguished leader; and it may not be out of place
here to quote the warm eulogy which Dr. Richardson afterwards
pronounced on his chief in his published narrative of the
transaction:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>In bestowing the name of Franklin on this remarkable
bay, I paid an appropriate compliment to the officer under whose
orders and by whose arrangements the delineation of all that is
known of the northern coast of the American continent has been
effected, with the exception of the parts in the vicinity of Icy
Cape discovered by Captain Beechey.<br>
<br>
It would not be proper, nor is it my intention, to descant on the
merits of my superior officer; but, after having served under
Captain Franklin for nearly seven years in two successive voyages
of discovery, I trust I may be allowed to say that, however high
his brother-officers may rate his courage and talents, either in
the ordinary line of his professional duty or in the field of
discovery, the hold he acquires upon the affections of those
under his command by a continued series of the most conciliatory
attentions to their feelings and a uniform and unremitting regard
to their best interests, is not less conspicuous. I feel that the
sentiments of my friends and companions, Captain Back and
Lieutenant Kendall, are in unison with my own when I affirm that
gratitude and attachment to our late commander will animate our
breasts to the latest period of our lives.</blockquote>
<p>This is only one among many similar tributes to the attractive
personal qualities of this great explorer. The roll on which
Franklin's name is inscribed has received many additions since
that now distant day when these words were written, but of how
few of those who have carried on his work of discovery could they
have been written with equal truth! In the gifts and attainments
which go to the making of the successful explorer Franklin has
had many rivals; but in this remarkable power of enlisting the
enthusiastic loyalty and devotion of his followers he has far
excelled the majority of his successors, has been equalled by few
of them, and surpassed by none.</p>
<p>The winter of 1826 had of course to be spent, like the
preceding one, at Fort Franklin, and early in the following year
preparations were made for a return to England. Leaving
instructions for Back, now promoted to the rank of commander, to
proceed to York Factory with the remainder of the party as soon
as the ice should break up, Franklin left the Fort accompanied by
five men.</p>
<p>Fort Simpson was reached on March 8, Fort Resolution on the
26th, Fort Chipewyan on April 12, and the party were at Fort
Cumberland by June 18. Thence Franklin proceeded to Montreal and
New York, whence he took ship to England, where he arrived on
September 26, 1827, after an absence of over two years and seven
months.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<p align="center">THREE YEARS OF REPOSE<br>
<br>
1827-1830</p>
<p><small>THIS</small> second Arctic voyage, though naturally
enough it impressed itself less upon the popular imagination than
the first, was felt in official no less than in scientific
circles to have established Franklin's claim to more
distinguished honours than had previously been bestowed upon him.
It had, indeed, been rich in solid additions to our knowledge of
the earth's surface. Its geographical result, taking Franklin's
and Richardson's exploration together, was the discovery and
exact delineation of more than 1,200 miles of the coast of the
American continent up to that time absolutely unknown. The
geological, magnetic, meteorological, and other scientific
observations made by the various members of the expedition, and
given in full in the appendix to Franklin's 'Narrative', were
also of the highest value and interest, and were so recognised by
the Admiralty and the learned societies. Franklin himself
believed, and with justice, that he had accomplished yet more,
and that his inability to effect a junction with Beechey was
rather a failure in form than in fact. Writing to his
sister-in-law, Mrs. Kay, from Fort Franklin in September 1826, he
had said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I have reason to think that the Government will be
perfectly satisfied with our proceedings; indeed, a great deal
has been accomplished, and I think there will no longer be a
doubt remaining in the mind of any reasonable man as to the
existence of a North-West Passage, especially if Captain Beechey
gets round Icy Cape.</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, some delay of a not quite explicable character
was interposed to the official recognition of Franklin's service;
and France, indeed, by presenting him with the gold medal of the
Paris Geographical Society, may be said to have recognised them
before his native country. It was not till the spring of 1829
that he was knighted, nor till the summer of that year that, in
company with Sir Edward Parry, he received the justly prized
honour of the degree of D.C.L. at the hands of the University of
Oxford.</p>
<p>The previous year, however, was marked by an incident of even
greater interest, his engagement to the lady who became his
second wife. In this, as in the former case, we may find the
first shadow of this coming event projected on the map of the
Arctic regions, and trace the name of the future bride in the
nomenclature of Franklin's latest discoveries. It seems evident
that the attractions of Miss Jane Griffin must have caught
Franklin's observation at some time between his first and the
second expedition, and have led to his commemorating her in the
bestowal of the name of Point Griffin on a promontory discovered
by him on the American coast to the west of the Mackenzie River.
Never, at any rate, was conquest easier to understand. The
portrait of this lady, taken only some few years before the date
of her first acquaintance with Franklin, shows a countenance not
only beautiful of feature, but alive with a vivacity and
animation which add indescribably to its charm. The sweetness of
nature, the bright intelligence, and the playful humour which
were united in this remarkable woman, and which rendered her
conversation and still renders her correspondence delightful,
look forth unmistakably from this presentment of her by a skilled
artistic hand. A man of a far less impressionable nature might
not have been proof against her combined fascinations of person,
temperament, and mind. No wonder the susceptible Franklin found
them impossible to resist.</p>
<p>Nor is it at all extraordinary that the attraction should have
been mutual. In point of age and social position they were
equally matched; and as the hero of memorable and daring
adventures Franklin was surrounded by an air of romance which was
likely to prove captivating to a woman of imagination. That
winning personality, too, which so much endeared him to his
followers could hardly fail to impress itself on Miss Griffin. It
was in the main, no doubt, a charm of spirit and address, and of
what we are accustomed to describe indefinitely but expressively
as 'ways;' yet it is clear that it was not unassociated at this
time of his life with the advantages of a pleasing exterior. 'His
features and expression', says one of his relations describing
him at about this period, 'were grave and mild, and very
benignant; his stature rather below the middle height; his look
very kind and his manner very quiet, as of one accustomed to
command others.' In a word, he was emphatically a man well
calculated to win that mixture of respect and admiration which in
women of intelligence and force of character who have left mere
girlhood behind is always more or less likely under favouring
circumstances to beget a warmer sentiment.</p>
<p>Miss Griffin was the second daughter of Mr. John Griffin, of
Bedford Place, a solicitor of high standing in his profession.
Her elder sister, to whom she was sincerely attached, and who was
the recipient of many of her most interesting letters, became the
wife of Mr. Simpkinson, a successful barrister, subsequently Q.C.
and Bencher of his Inn. It was no doubt a special recommendation
to Franklin's affections that Miss Griffin had been a personal
friend of his first wife and took an almost motherly interest in
his orphan daughter.</p>
<p>The engagement was one of but a few months' duration, but they
were months of busiest occupation for the ever-active Franklin.
It seems probable that the stimulating results of the last
expedition&mdash;incompletely successful yet so tantalisingly
near complete success&mdash;may have quickened the maritime
instincts of the Duke of Clarence, then Lord High Admiral. It is,
at any rate, certain that before Franklin had been a year in
England we find him drafting, 'by His Royal Highness's command',
a plan for the 'completion of the survey of the northern coast of
America.' Two, and only two, portions of coast, he pointed out,
and those of no very great extent as compared with the amount
already delineated, remained to be explored&mdash;one to the
eastward, lying between the Fury and Hecla Strait of Parry and
Cape Turnagain (Franklin's own furthest of 1821); the other
within Russian territory, to the westward; being in fact the 160
miles of coast which divided Point Beechey (Franklin's furthest
westward from the Mackenzie River in 1826) and the discoveries of
Captain Beechey to the eastward of Behring Strait.</p>
<p>As regards the former and, as he says, the most interesting of
these portions, Franklin's idea was to send two boat detachments
across Melville Peninsula from a ship stationed in Repulse Bay,
one to proceed westward to Point Turnagain, and the other
northward to the Fury and Hecla Strait, Cockburn Island, and
Prince Regent's Inlet in the same season. The first part of this
scheme would no doubt have been impracticable. At the time when
Franklin conceived it it was not known that the American coast
westward of Melville Peninsula took an immense trend to the
north-westward, forming the promontory now known as Boothia
Felix, which, until the discovery of Bellot Strait, was supposed
to be continuous with North Somerset Land, and to survey which,
therefore, by a boat expedition would have meant coasting round
some thousand miles of shore before the explorers could get back
even to the mere latitude of Cape Turnagain.</p>
<p>But the interest of the plan lies in its supplemental
proposal, at once bold and ingenious, to send another party under
an experienced guide through the interior of America to the
eastern side of the Great Slave Lake. Of the prospects of
discovery which such a party would find before them Franklin
writes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The Northern Indians have described a river which,
passing near the east end of this lake, flows into the Polar Sea.
Though we could not learn the exact position of its mouth, yet we
found sufficient testimony to warrant the conclusion that it lies
to the eastward of Point Turnagain. The land party, being
provided with two boats or canoes, might descend this stream and
trace the coast from its mouth westward to Point Turnagain. If
the distance to that point proves inconsiderable, the party
should return and continue eastward along the coast until it met
the party from Repulse Bay, or to such time as would allow of
their reaching their winter quarters. If the junction did take
place, the land party might accompany the others to the
ship.</blockquote>
<p>Franklin then proceeds to set out his companion scheme for the
exploration of the westerly portion of the unexplored coast, and
concludes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I have thus endeavoured to state my opinions
regarding these surveys as briefly as the objects would admit,
reserving the details relative to the kind of boats to be used
and the general equipment of the ships until it is your Royal
Highness's pleasure to honour me with your further commands on
these points. They are the result of the closest reflection and
most mature consideration of the subject, and I humbly offer them
under the full impression that, if these attempts were directed
to be made, they would lead to a successful termination. I may
further add that if the boats did succeed in passing along the
shore, as I have proposed, the question of a North-West Passage
would be satisfactorily determined, as the whole of the coast
between Behring Strait and the outlet into the Atlantic would
then have been traced and the sea actually navigated.<br>
<br>
Should these suggestions meet the approbation of your Royal
Highness, and be in consequence ordered to be put into execution,
I hope your Royal Highness will permit me to solicit the honour
of an appointment to one of them.</blockquote>
<p>Whether they met the Duke's private approbation or not, there
is nothing to show, but their official rejection could hardly
have been more speedy and summary than it was. Franklin's
memorandum is dated June 17, and within twenty-four hours he
received a reply from an Admiralty official, who had been
'commanded by His Royal Highness to acknowledge the receipt of
your letter of yesterday's date, and to acquaint you that His
Royal Highness does not intend to recommend any more Northern
expeditions to His Majesty's Government.'</p>

<br>
<small>PORTRAIT of LADY FRANKLIN<br>
from a drawing by Mlle. Romily.</small></p>
<br>
<p>For punctuality, directness, and decision, this letter left
nothing to be desired, and Franklin was now free to make
arrangements for a visit to a foreign State, his interest in
which had possibly been quickened by his recent invasion of its
most remote dominions. Accordingly, and within less than a
fortnight after receiving the above-quoted communication from the
Admiralty, he applied to that department in the usual form for
permission to proceed to Russia, and a six months' leave having
been granted him, subject to the customary restrictions as to not
'entering into the service of any foreign Power or State', he
left England for what proved to be a very interesting visit to
the Russian capital. The curiosity as to his personality which
his achievements as an explorer had aroused throughout Europe was
as strong in Courts and palaces as elsewhere; and when Franklin,
through our representative in St. Petersburg, solicited the
honour of a presentation to the Empress of Russia, she graciously
replied that she would in his case depart from the usual
etiquette attending introductions to Her Majesty, and invited him
to dine at the palace on 'the 19th of September at two o'clock',
and bestowed a further mark of her favour by including in the
invitation a Russian Admiral of Franklin's acquaintance, in order
that some one might be at hand to explain to her every point
relative to the English explorer's recent voyage. Of this
dinner-party he gives a minute and interesting account in his
diary. The Emperor was greatly interested in his voyages, and
plied him with many questions on the subject. After dinner he was
introduced to the Grand Duke, destined to a troubled reign and a
tragic end as the Czar Alexander II. At his departure the young
heir-apparent, then about ten years old, took leave of him in the
following stately fashion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>'I am happy, Captain Franklin, in having had the
pleasure of seeing you, and should I ever visit England it will
afford me much pleasure to renew my acquaintance with you.'
Finding as we were leaving the room that we were going into the
library, he requested the permission of his tutor to accompany
us, which was granted. A map of North America was spread out, and
the librarian begged of me to point out our route from New York,
and the discoveries along the coast, and put many other
questions, to which the Grand Duke listened very attentively. It
was evident, too, that many of these were put for his
instruction, as they related to other parts besides the line of
our voyage. A French translation of my first narrative was then
brought out, and I was told that it was from this work, which she
had read twice, that the Empress gained her
information.</blockquote>
<p>Then follows a pleasant 'touch of nature', author's and
explorer's:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I confess I felt a regret that she had only read this
voyage compressed in a small octavo&mdash;which was without
plates&mdash;and I immediately said I would have the honour of
forwarding a quarto edition of that as well as of the last
narrative. The Grand Duke then drew forth a set of plates
belonging to the voyage of Captain Ross, and begged me to explain
them, which I of course did, dwelling, by the way, on the modes
used to break the ice so as to admit the ships, on the killing of
bears, and other subjects to which the pictures had
reference.</blockquote>
<p>After another brief interview with the Empress, who 'begged
that if I returned to Russia I would give her the opportunity of
seeing me again', the visitor finally took his leave. In
reviewing the incidents of the visit, he recalls only one
question put to him bearing upon politics, which was when the
Empress-Mother asked him how the Emperor was liked in England.
For an 'only question', it was a pretty awkward one for an
Englishman to answer in 1828. Franklin does not record his reply.
Nor does he refer further to the Czar Nicholas, except to relate
of him a rather striking little anecdote. The Emperor himself
seemed, he remarked, to be fond of the Navy, 'especially of
ship-building, from his having ordered many new ships to be
built' On his being told that the wood was green, and that his
ships could not be expected to last if hastily put together, he
made the somewhat ominous reply, 'Never mind; if they will hold
together five years they will answer my present purpose.' Before
that period had passed Franklin was to find himself placed as an
English naval officer in a situation in which it is not
improbable that this Imperial utterance, with all the sinister
import which might attach to it, recurred to his mind.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the future Lady Franklin, as might be expected from
a woman of her energetic disposition, had not been content to
remain inactive in England, to the neglect of such an opportunity
as now presented itself of enjoying a foreign tour in the society
of her intended husband. It had been Franklin's wish that she
should accompany him to Russia, but for reasons which will appear
below she had declined to do so; and the letter in which she
refers to this matter is throughout so pleasantly illustrative
both of her own winning qualities and of her admiring affection
for Franklin, that the following passages may well be extracted
from it. As much may be learned of a man's personality from the
character and depth of the sentiment with which he was able to
inspire such a woman as Miss Griffin as could perhaps be gathered
from any words or acts of his own. The letter is superscribed 'At
sea, July 26.' It appears to have been written very shortly after
quitting England for the shores of the Baltic:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>My dear Captain Franklin,&mdash;I give you early
proof of thinking of you because I begin to feel very
uncomfortable, and in a short time I may perhaps be fit for
nothing during the remainder of the voyage. I know also that the
post goes out from Hamburg on Tuesday, and that after our arrival
at the hotel on Monday evening we shall have no more than just
time enough to look after carriages and horses to convey
ourselves and our baggage to L&uuml;beck, particularly as we
shall be obliged to leave Hamburg early on Tuesday morning. . . .
Our condition is somewhat better than it was yesterday evening,
for the captain has so far kept his promise as to remove one tier
of boxes from behind the sailcloth, and the others have been
lashed together, so that another tier of berths has been
developed, though the stern windows remain invisible and closed.
I care as little about these minor inconveniences as most people,
or rather can submit to them as well, if they are necessary and
inevitable, but not otherwise; and whenever I think I am imposed
upon my spirit rises, and I struggle harder to resist than
perhaps is quite consistent with that meek and resigned spirit
which men endeavour to teach us is not only becoming but
obligatory, and which we poor women endowed with acute
sensibilities, though with less energy and much less power than
men, often find to be our surest and safest way to happiness.<br>
<br>
Do not be alarmed at these moralising reflections drawn from the
consideration of the boxes and the cabin windows. You are of a
much more easy disposition than myself, in spite of that energy
and firmness of mind which, when the occasion calls for it, you
can display as well or better than most men, and without which
you never could have won my regard. It must be my province,
therefore, when we travel together in France or elsewhere, or
even on our lengthened journey through life, to combat those
things which excite my more sensitive temper; while it must and
shall be yours, as my beloved and most honoured husband, to
control even this disposition whenever you think it improperly
excited, and to exert over me in all things that influence, or,
if it must be [substituted for, 'if you please,' as perhaps going
less imprudently far in the way of concession], that authority
which it will be your privilege to use and my duty to yield to.
But do I speak of <i>duty</i>? You are of too manly, too
generous, too affectionate a disposition to like the word, and
God forbid I should ever be the wretched wife who obeyed her
husband from a sense of duty alone without finding her greatest
delight in yielding to his wishes in all things. Do not fear,
therefore, that as long as my respect and esteem for you remain
unimpaired, and consequently my affection uninjured, so long will
my conjugal yoke sit most lightly and easily upon me, and that
ring of which I now bear the emblem on the <i>wrong</i> finger
will be (as I sometimes fancy it looks like) not the badge of
slavery, but the cherished link of the purest affection.<br>
<br>
Need I call you <i>my dear</i> (again?) after this? I think you
can afford that I should spare myself the use of all such
epithets: or perhaps you might have liked an epithet or two the
more, and my serious observations the less. If you are a very
prudent man, however, you will put this letter by and turn it to
account at some future time when I am in a rebellious mood; and
upon this consideration I think you ought to feel infinitely
obliged to me for furnishing you with so valuable a document. How
soon shall I repent of it myself? I cannot pretend to say, but at
present my silly heart reminds me that I have given you some
little cause for reproach against me by opposing your original
inclination to be of our party throughout the journey, and I want
you to feel that never, never more, after our bonds are tied,
shall I wish to be separated from you, or to differ from or to
thwart your strongly expressed inclinations. In the present case,
however, my objection to your first proposal arose from a strong
sense of impropriety in the arrangement, as well as from a
conviction that we should all be placed in a number of awkward
and disagreeable situations during long and rough voyages and
journeys which it would be extremely unpleasant to me to partake
in and impossible to avoid. . . . You yielded to my feelings with
a forbearance which obliged me, and I thought to compromise
matters a little, and to avoid many other inconveniences, by
suggesting that the marriage could take place abroad&mdash;a
circumstance perfectly natural, since there was not time enough
between the time when you first explained yourself to me and the
moment fixed for our departure for it to take place beforehand. .
. . When we gave up this last arrangement, nothing remained for
us but to be absent from one another till our return in October
(for I was ill-behaved enough not to wish you to join us at all
during our journey), or to delay our setting off and be united
first.</blockquote>
<p>Having recalled the reasons why this last plan was
unacceptable, she continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Besides, I do not now feel the same alarm as to the
journey. By your disinterested zeal and kindness we are furnished
with every facility that can insure a safe and prosperous
expedition, and, therefore, when I regret that you cannot now
accompany us, and look forward with pleasure to our meeting at
Petersburg, it is not altogether or alone from the want I feel of
your present and future services as because I grieve that you are
disappointed now, and rejoice that you are looking forward to
something that will please you hereafter. . . . Come, then, to
St. Petersburg, and in the meantime do not suppose it possible
that I can feel otherwise than painfully your absence. I should
rejoice to see with you the same things for the first time, to
help or be helped by you in every little difficulty, to become
acquainted together with the same people, to be the objects of
the same hospitality and kindness, and to witness with pride and
sympathy that your claims to interest and esteem are acknowledged
in a foreign land as well as in your own. I shall be far from
wishing you to give up going to Moscow, even should it involve
your later return to England and the consequent derangement of
all our plans. It would be a matter of great concern, and even
compunction to me, should you have any after regrets on the
subject.</blockquote>
<p>In another letter, written 'At sea, in the Gulf of Finland',
in which the formality of her former commencement, 'My dear
Captain Franklin,' is exchanged with a view to 'local colour' for
'My dear Ivan', while for herself she adopts the Russianised
signature of 'Jane Ivanovna', Miss Griffin amusingly hits off one
of Franklin's most characteristic traits:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The only ground of anxiety I have that you should not
be in time is founded upon the possibility of your not learning
at Hamburg the mistake in your further calculations. This would
have been highly improbable, since, though no German scholar, you
would have found means enough there of asking questions; and
since my visit with you to the Elstree Reservoir I cannot doubt
of your always being inquisitive enough. You recollect that it
was remarked of you there that they should not have supposed it
possible that any reservoir, be it as deep or as wide as it
might, could have afforded room for such varied and innumerable
interrogations.</blockquote>
<p>Both Franklin and his future wife had returned from their
Russian tour by the early autumn of 1828, and in the month of
October of this year he paid a visit worth recording to his old
commander, Captain Cumby, who had retired from the Navy and was
living the life of a country squire at Hughington, near
Darlington. Franklin arrived there on the ever-memorable 21st,
which it was his host's annual custom to celebrate, and in a
letter of the following day to Miss Griffin, then staying for her
health at Malvern, he gives the following interesting account of
the rejoicings. After describing how all the young people of the
village had been paraded and feasted in honour of the day, he
continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>On the church steeple, the flag under which the old
Bellerophon fought was waving, with many of its shot-holes still
unclosed, and you can well conceive the delight it afforded to
me, especially as the preservation of it in the hour of battle
was one of the particular parts of my duty as signal officer on
the occasion. Twice it was lowered by the enemy's shot, but again
speedily re-hoisted in triumph; and lest the enemy might suppose
from its being even for a moment lowered that it was done
intentionally, another flag was spread along the rigging by an
intrepid seaman under the most galling fire, which was continued
throughout the action in that position. With the exception of
Mrs. and Miss Cumby, the Captain's eldest son, and the vicar and
his brother, the party consisted of naval men. The most
interesting person was the Rev. Dr. Scott, Lord Nelson's
chaplain, in whose arms, I believe, our noble commander-in-chief
breathed his last sigh. He gave us a variety of anecdotes of
Nelson, antecedently to this battle, relating to the chase which
he made after the enemy to the West Indies.</blockquote>
<p>Franklin's wedding with Miss Griffin took place on November 5,
1828, at Stanmore Church, 'very prettily situated in one of the
most picturesque villages near London', and, it is to be gathered
from a letter to his sister, under auspices as happy in every
respect as became a marriage of such obviously mutual affection
and esteem. The bride and bridegroom, who were married from the
house of the former's sister, left it in the evening for Ascot
Place, 'the mansion of a considerable estate belonging to the
Manor of Ascot and the property of one of Mr. Franklin's
cousins.' Here they remained for a week, and then quitted England
to finish the honeymoon in Paris.</p>
<p>Franklin's fame as a contributor to geographical science had
preceded him, and he found himself the recipient of marked
attentions from Parisian society, both learned and fashionable.
He had taken with him a letter of introduction to the Duke of
Orleans, two years later to become the King of the French, who
responded to his presentation of it by inviting him to dinner on
the following day. 'The scientific men,' he writes to his sister,
'of whom Baron Cuvier is the head, have been no less kind to me,
and I have enjoyed a very high treat in becoming known to the
<i>savants</i> of France with whose names I have long been
familiar. I have dined with Baron Cuvier and been at some of the
public scientific meetings; I have also dined with our Ambassador
(Lord Stuart), M. Delessert, and Baron Rothschild, the great
Parisian banker, whose dinners, in point of style and luxury,
almost equal Oriental splendour.' In these honours and
festivities, however, Mrs. Franklin, he observes, was not able to
participate, 'it not being the custom for ladies to be invited to
dinner.' <i>Soir&eacute;es</i> were the special form of
entertainment provided for them by the fashion of the time. 'She
has been invited to one at Madame Rothschild's on Saturday, and
also to one at Madame Cuvier's, and I hope more invitations will
follow for her, for, though there may not be anything
particularly agreeable in these <i>soir&eacute;es</i>, yet they
are among the sights of Paris.' Three visits, he says, have been
paid to the theatres, of which there were then fifteen in the
French capital, and the irrepressible explorer declares his
intention of 'making the round of them' before his return home.
One of these visits was almost of a State character, as the
following letter, interesting on other grounds, will
show:&mdash;</p>
<p align="right" class="quote"><small>Neuilly: Friday morning,
December 5, 1828.</small>   </p>
<blockquote>Dear Sir,&mdash;Accept my best thanks for the highly
valued present you are so good as to make to me of the narrative
of your second journey to the shores of the Polar Sea. Its value
is still much increased by being indebted for it to its
celebrated author.<br>
<br>
My sister offers her best thanks for the note, also for the lines
so well adapted to the circumstance, and both will be placed in
the collection of <i>Autographes</i> of her friend le Marquis de
Dolomieu.<br>
<br>
Permit me to enclose an order for the Duchess of Orleans's box
this evening at the Opera, which we have thought might be
agreeable to Mrs. Franklin and to yourself. The box is roomy, and
may hold twelve persons.</blockquote>
<p align="center" class="quote">      I remain, with great
regard, dear Sir,<br>
            Your affectionate</p>
<p align="right" class="quote"><small>LOUIS-PHILIPPE
D'ORL&Eacute;ANS.   </small></p>
<p>The note and autograph above referred to were sent in response
to a request made to Franklin on the previous evening when he
dined with the Duke at Neuilly. The conversation, as recorded in
his diary, turned principally, like that of the Imperial dinner
party at St. Petersburg, on the exploits and sufferings of the
distinguished guest. One subject, however, of a less personal
character appears to have come up in the course of the evening on
which the interchange of views between guest and host is worth
noting:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>'The Duke', writes Franklin, 'likewise conversed with
me respecting the Canadas, Nova Scotia, and the Columbia River,
on all which subjects he had a perfect knowledge, gained, as he
said, by reading. He thought, as I do, that it was probable the
Canadas must eventually be independent, and if this concession
were granted with grace, the change would be beneficial in point
of trade to England. He thought, however, and justly, that it
would be necessary for us to retain Nova Scotia, for the sake of
Halifax as a naval position.'</blockquote>
<p>There is almost as much virtue in an 'eventually' as in an
'if', since no prediction which it qualifies can of course be
pronounced erroneous at any earlier date than the morning of
Doomsday. All one can say is that, though nearly seventy years
have passed since this conversation, the 'event' referred to
seems both to Englishmen and Canadians further off to-day than it
did then.</p>
<p>Of the banquet at the great financier's Franklin writes with
more mixed feelings:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>There I saw magnificence and luxury in its utmost
extent. To describe the dinner or even to name the wines is quite
beyond my power. The party, however, was but so-so; and the only
person I felt a delight in meeting was M. Hauseman, the Professor
of Geology at Gottingen, who is on his way to England. Baron
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was of the party, the editor of the
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; , who is considered a charlatan by the
<i>savans</i> of Paris, in which opinion I should coincide from
his conversation with me, which certainly did not show a person
of any great research or genius. There was a Count Mole (whom I
had met before at Baron Delessert's) and two other barons, but
they all appeared to be like their host, money-making men. The
conversation at dinner, as usual at the French table, was carried
on with the next person to you. I was seated on the left of
Rothschild by invitation, but I considered myself more fortunate
in having Professor Hauseman on my left, with whom I principally
conversed. For a time, however, the Baron addressed himself to
me, and having heard a little of the nature of our voyages, of
which he was till then ignorant, he became much interested, and
asked many questions. The cloven foot, however, was shown by his
inquiry, 'What did the British Government give you for all
that?'<br>
<br>
After dinner we had coffee as usual, and, several gentlemen
having gathered round me, Madame la Baronne begged I might be
invited to come near her. She then talked to me, but not with
much knowledge of the nature of my voyage, though she had
evidently read a I part of the narrative. She was, however,
desirous of gaining information, and this from a woman, though
her lips owed their pretty tint to a coating of rouge,
sufficiently encouraged me to say what I could for her amusement.
Her remark that the Indians, from my description of their moral
character, were well fitted for becoming Christians surprised me
not a little when I looked on her decidedly Jewish
visage.</blockquote>
<p>A few days later Franklin was presented to Madame la Dauphine,
the Duchesse d'Angoul&ecirc;me of 1815, who learned with interest
that he had been second in command of the British ship of war
which had been placed at her service to convey her back to France
at the close of her long exile.</p>
<p>The beginning of the year 1829 saw the Franklins back again in
London and established for the time at a house in Devonshire
Street, Portland Place. In April of that year, as has been
already above recorded, he made that transforming obeisance to
the Sovereign from which he 'rose up Sir John', and in the
following July he stood side by side with his gallant colleague
and competitor in Arctic enterprise, Captain Parry, in the
Sheldonian Theatre at Oxford, to receive the not too lavishly
bestowed distinction of Honorary D.C.L. The deeds of the two
explorers formed the subject for the Newdigate Poem of that year,
and were celebrated by the prizeman, Mr. T. L. Claughton,
afterwards Bishop of Truro, in verse which, though not inferior
in smoothness to the average prize poem, undoubtedly partakes
more of the frigidity than of the grandeur of its Arctic
theme.</p>
<p>The new knight and D.C.L. was the last man to rest content
with his honours or to look forward to a life of repose after his
toils and sufferings. He was already longing again for active
employment, if not in the work of exploration&mdash;and the curt
letter from the Admiralty in the previous year had extinguished
that hope altogether&mdash;then in any public service which would
afford room for the exercise of his organising abilities and his
conscious faculty of command. Nay, it is evident enough that mere
prolonged physical inaction was irksome to him, and that his body
no less than his mind craved imperatively for exertion. His
indeed was one of those not uncommon cases in which the outer
belies the inner man. One of the royal ladies to whom he was
presented in Paris had with some naivete expressed her surprise
at the plump and comfortable appearance of the traveller who had
undergone such incredible privations in the course of his
adventures. The paradox, it need hardly be said, was only
apparent; but we can understand the Duchess's difficulty in
associating the portly naval officer before her with the idea of
a prolonged diet of deer-hide and <i>tripe de roche</i>.
Incidentally it appears from the correspondence between Sir John
and Lady Franklin that his weight at this period of his career
was fifteen stone, which for a man of no more than middle height
and but forty-three years of age is very considerably above the
average. Nothing, however, is more delusive than the common
tendency to connect mere bodily bulk with indolence and love of
physical repose. The obese Napoleon, gorged with empire, who
struck down Prussia at Jena and Austria at Austerlitz, was a man
of the same untiring energy of body as the lean and hungry
soldier of the first Italian campaign. And there is no reason to
doubt that not only at this period of his life, but for a good
many years afterwards, Franklin's physical activity and his power
of sustaining fatigue and privation were, his bulk
notwithstanding, unimpaired.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he was not disposed to accept any form of active
employment which might be offered to him by any body of
employers, no matter whom. On the contrary, he felt, and rightly
felt, that as a naval officer some fitting occupation should be
found for him in the service not merely of the country but of the
Crown. Thus he records in the early summer of 1829 that he had
just declined a 'very tempting and flattering offer from the
Australian Company to manage their concerns in New South Wales.'
The remuneration proposed, 2,000<i>l</i>. a year, was for those
days ample, and the work attached to the office must have had
many attractions for him. But his resolve not to separate himself
from the service to which he had devoted himself for now nearly
thirty years was unalterably fixed. He looked to the Admiralty or
to some other department of the State to find him employment, and
after another year and a half of patient, or more probably
perhaps of impatient, waiting he obtained it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, he never doubted the wisdom of
refusing all solicitations to engage himself to any private body
of employers. 'I felt', he writes to his wife concerning this
Australian offer, 'that such an occupation would withdraw me from
my profession for some years to come, and might materially injure
my future prospects in the service. Besides, having now been so
many years employed in land service, I am particularly anxious to
avail myself of the first opportunity of getting into active
naval employment.' The appointment declined by Franklin was
afterwards offered to and, at the urgent instance of many of his
friends, accepted by Sir Edward Parry.</p>
<p>Franklin was not now to be exposed to any more temptations of
this kind to quit the regular line of the service. Events in
Europe during the closing years of this decade had already given
some unexpected and indeed, so far as the British Government were
concerned, undesired employment to the British Navy; and though
it was not Franklin's fortune to be among the officers engaged in
the singular battle of Navarino&mdash;that affair of which a
noble admiral of the period humorously remarked that 'it was a
capital fight, only we knocked down the wrong man'&mdash;the
international crisis out of which it had arisen created not long
afterwards a necessity for increased activity among His Majesty's
ships in the Mediterranean. The nascent kingdom of Greece, it was
generally admitted in European Courts and Cabinets, required
watching by the Powers. It was also thought in certain quarters
(though this was not so generally admitted) that some, or at any
rate one, of the Powers required watching by the others. By the
middle of the year 1830, one, if not both, of these causes for
increased activity in the Mediterranean was thought to have
become urgent; and in 'prospecting' round for experienced and
highly capable officers to employ in a service which was certain
to be important, and might in conceivable circumstances become
extremely difficult, the eye of the Admiralty fell upon Sir John
Franklin. His application for employment lay before them with the
high claims attached to it, and, since there is no evidence in
his correspondence to show that he recalled their attention to
it, they may actually have remembered him of themselves.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, he was selected for a command. On August 23
he received the long-looked-for and eagerly welcomed official
notice to the effect that 'My Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty having appointed you Captain of His Majesty's ship the
Rainbow, at Portsmouth, it is their Lordships' direction that you
or your agent repair immediately to this office, and that you
report to me the day on which you shall have joined the
ship.'</p>
<p>The prospect of new employment was hardly more welcome to
Franklin himself than to his ambitious and energetic wife. Her
correspondence of this period shows I signs that she was almost
as much bitten with the longing for Arctic exploration as he.
Parry, too, she reminds him, was meditating new voyages of
discovery, with Lady Parry's concurrence and even encouragement.
The idea was never to be realised, and the magnificent exploit of
1827 was Parry's last attack upon the Pole. There, in lat 82&deg;
45', was, in Othello's words, 'his butt, and very sea-mark of his
utmost sail.' And not a bad one either, considering that it
remained the seamark of the whole human race for nearly fifty
years. But if there were to be no more Arctic expeditions for the
present, it was at least something that Franklin should have got
afloat once more. 'I look back', wrote Lady Franklin to him,
'with almost remorse on our career of vanity, trifling, and
idleness'&mdash;that is to say, from November of 1828 to August
of 1830, a year and nine months, and part of it a honeymoon. To
less restless spirits it does not seem so very shocking.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>
<p align="center">A MEDITERRANEAN COMMAND<br>
<br>
1830-1833</p>
<p><small>THE</small> mission on which Franklin was now
despatched presents so striking a contrast to any of his previous
employments as a naval officer that it is desirable to suspend
the progress of this narrative for a while in order to take a
brief survey of the task before him and to point out its
singularly difficult conditions. And, as a preliminary step to
this process, it will be necessary to recall as concisely as may
be the incidents of a now forgotten chapter of European
history.</p>
<p>Greece, in the year 1830, had just succeeded, by the aid of
the two Western Powers acting in formal concert but not in wholly
confidential alliance with Russia, in throwing off the yoke of
the Sultan and establishing its independence. Navarino, that
'untoward event', as the victory was so frankly described by one
of the victors, had been fought and won&mdash;or rather blundered
into and out of&mdash;two years before. The Porte had formally
consented a few months before to the erection of Greece into an
independent kingdom; and nothing remained but for the Powers to
choose an eligible European prince for the new throne, to secure
his acceptance of the honour, and to induct him into his
sovereignty. But the second of these three steps was found to
present unexpected difficulties. The first choice, or meditated
choice, of the kingmakers was Prince John of Saxony, but the
crown was declined by him with thanks. Leopold of Coburg, the
next to be selected, showed a disposition to accept the offer,
and the negotiations for the formal completion of the arrangement
had, indeed, made some progress when the Prince, partly through
disapproval of some of the conditions which were to be imposed
upon him, and partly-influenced, it is supposed, by the change in
his prospects consequent on the death of George IV.&mdash;an
event which brought his sister, the Duchess of Kent, within one
remove of the Regency which would fall to her as the mother of
her present Majesty, then a child of eleven&mdash;revoked his
provisional assent, and the Greek crown once more went a-begging.
Meanwhile the somewhat rotten reins of such government as Greece
possessed remained in the hands of Capo d'Istria, an active and
astute intriguer, of Greek origin indeed, but who had spent fifty
years of his previous life as a minister of the Czar of Russia, a
period during which he devoted himself incessantly, and in the
end successfully, to the work of diplomatically undermining the
authority of the Porte over its Hellenic subjects. Upon the
definitive overthrow of Turkish rule he had contrived to get
possession of the machinery of executive control in the newly
liberated country, and to obtain an informal recognition of his
de facto presidency.</p>
<p>Capo d'Istria possessed considerable ability, which, no doubt,
seemed greater by comparison with the noisy and frequently
ferocious mediocrities whom the Revolution had raised up around
him. He appears to have been a man of sincere patriotism, and of
disinterested if somewhat narrow ideals. But he overrated, says a
well-known historian of these events, alike 'the influence of
orthodoxy in the Ottoman Empire and the power of Russia in the
international system of Europe', an error natural in a politician
whose experience of mankind had been acquired either in the
confined and corrupt society of Corfu, or in the artificial
atmosphere of Russian diplomacy. Other drawbacks he had which
could not but detract in some measure from his efficiency as an
administrator. Italian was his mother tongue, and, though he
could speak Greek fluently enough, he was unable to write it, and
both in conversation and in despatches he was in the habit of
using French. 'For a statesman, he was far too loquacious. He
allowed everybody who approached him to perceive that on many
great political questions of importance to Greece his ideas were
vague and unsettled. At times he spoke as a warm panegyrist of
Russian absolutism, and at others as an enthusiastic admirer of
American democracy.'</p>
<p>The Western Powers, it may be imagined, were more impressed by
the panegyrics than by the admiration. The circumstances of his
election were such as naturally induced the English Government to
regard him as the nominee of Russia, and his own policy and
declared opinions encouraged the belief that he was no friend to
this country. Fifteen years earlier, at the European settlement
which followed upon the victory of Waterloo, he had exerted
himself, and had been allowed to employ all the influence of
Russia, to re-establish that Ionian Republic which had been
created in 1803, and at the downfall of which in 1807, by the
annexation of the islands to the French Empire, he had
transferred his services to the Czar. He never forgave the
Government of Great Britain for having insisted on retaining
possession of the Ionian group, and on holding complete control
over their government as a check on Russian intrigues among the
Orthodox population of the Ottoman Empire. And the view taken by
the English Ministers of his sympathies and tendencies was
confirmed by the part which he was believed to have played in the
negotiations which led to Prince Leopold's withdrawal. It was in
May 1830 that this event took place, and when Franklin received
his appointment to the Mediterranean service four months later
the relations between the British Cabinet and the Greek President
were those of mutual distrust.</p>
<p>The situation in Greece, however, was destined to be yet more
gravely complicated by a tragic incident which took place towards
the close of the following year. On October 9, 1831, Capo
d'Istria was assassinated by the brothers Mavromichales, two
political opponents with whom, it was alleged, he had
treacherously and oppressively dealt; and with his death Greece
entered on a period of almost absolute anarchy. A few hours after
his murder a governing commission, consisting of three
members&mdash;Agostino Capo d'Istria, brother of the murdered
President, and two other prominent politicians, Kolokotrone and
Koletti&mdash;was appointed to exercise the executive power until
the meeting of the National Assembly. But the so-called
Constitutional party, who had opposed the autocratic rule of the
late President, were little inclined to submit to the improvised
junta who proposed to carry on his policy. They prepared to
resist it not only in the Assembly, but, in case they should be
defeated there, in the field. The Capodistrians were strong in
the Morea, in which&mdash;at Argos&mdash;the Assembly met, and
their party succeeded in obtaining a considerable majority at the
elections. But they were supposed to have derived much additional
strength from the open support given them by the Russian Admiral
Ricord; and that they themselves were not deficient in the
faculty of self-help is evident from the fact that in certain
places where they were in a minority they succeeded in securing
the return of their candidates by military force. The
irregularity of these elections did not, of course, invalidate
them, for the simple reason that the Capodistrians possessed a
majority in the Assembly, and had no superstitious scruples about
using it. Both parties circulated the most odious calumnies
against their opponents, the Capodistrians accusing the French
and English of being privy to the murder of the President, and
the Constitutionalists alleging that the murdered man had himself
bribed 'six traitors' to murder the leader of the Opposition.</p>
<p>The art of 'working' a popular assembly in such a way as to
give a constitutional and even democratic air to the
man&oelig;uvres of the men who have 'got hold of the machine' was
less thoroughly comprehended in those days than it is in these.
If the Capodistrians understood packing a House, they evidently
did not understand 'running' it after it was packed. Probably
there was not enough ready money for the work, and the eligible
places were all filled. Anyhow, they found it impossible to
manage the minority. Loud complaints were made that the elections
had been illegally controlled by military force, and that a force
exerted in favour of Russian domination. A large body of members
accordingly protested against the competency of the Assembly to
proceed to business, and were for their pains driven from Argos
by a body of troops which the Provisional Government, fearlessly
braving the calumnies of their opponents, had placed under the
command of a Russian officer. The seceders repaired to Megara,
formed themselves into a National Assembly, and declared
themselves to be the only legal representatives of the Greek
nation.</p>
<p>This, of course, made two bodies of 'only legal
representatives', each of them naturally animated with deadly
hostility to the other. Geographically speaking, they were very
unequally matched, the Morea alone adhering in general to the
Provisional Government, while the population of all the rest of
the mainland and of the Archipelago supported the Assembly of
Megara. Nor were the insurgents long in demonstrating their
superiority in physical force. Marching into the Morea, they
easily overthrew the feeble rule of the younger Capo d'Istria and
his two colleagues, and proceeded to establish a commission of
seven members, to discharge the nominal functions of an executive
till the Great Powers should have settled the destinies of the
independent State which they had created.</p>
<p>And nominal indeed those functions were. They seem, in fact,
to have consisted for some time to come in issuing admirably
rhetorical manifestoes and proclamations from Napoli di Romania
(the ancient Nauplia, at the head of the Argolic Gulf), which
were read, doubtless with much interest, on the walls of that
city, but received not the slightest attention outside them. The
party of revolution, like other revolutionary parties before and
since their time, possessed precisely sufficient strength to
overthrow the government against which they rose, but were
unfortunately left without a margin of power wherewith to
establish any really authoritative government of their own.
Conscious of this deficiency, they devoted the remainder of their
energies to the work of farming out the revenues among their
friends and favourites at half their value; the result of which
financial operation was to leave an army of 8,000 men without any
pay or other 'visible means of subsistence' than that of preying
upon their fellow-countrymen&mdash;an industry to which they
immediately adapted themselves with all the versatility of their
race.</p>
<p>The situation, as it appeared to Mr. Finlay, an historian in
thorough sympathy with the cause of Greek independence is thus
described:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The Roumeliots, after overthrowing Agostino's
government, daily lost ground. The Commission of Seven was either
unable or unwilling to reward their services. The soldiers soon
determined to reward themselves. They treated the election of the
Commission as a temporary compromise, not as a definitive treaty
of peace, and they marched into different districts in the Morea
to take possession of the national revenues as a security for
their pay and rations. Wherever they established themselves, they
lived at free quarters in the houses of the inhabitants, or were
authorised to collect arrears due from preceding farmers. These
proceedings gave rise to intolerable exactions. The chieftains
often paid their followers by allowing them to extort a number of
rations from the peasantry, and defrauded them of their pay. Some
drew pay and rations for a hundred men without having twenty
under arms. Numbers of soldiers were disbanded, and roved
backwards and forwards, plundering the villages and devouring the
sheep and oxen of the peasants. . . . Eight thousand Roumeliots
were at this time living at free quarters in the Morea, and it
was said that they levied daily from the population to the extent
of upwards of 20,000 rations.<br>
<br>
The financial administration [of the Commission] was not
calculated to moderate the rapacity of the troops. They raised
money by private bargains for the sale of the tenths, and the
proceeds of these anticipated and frequently illegal rates were
employed to reward personal partisans, and not to discharge the
just debts due to the soldiers for arrears of pay. A small sum
judiciously expended would have sent many of the Roumeliot troops
to their native mountains, whither, as peace was now restored,
they would have willingly returned had they been able to procure
the means of cultivating their property. The troops were
neglected, while favoured chieftains were allowed to become
farmers of taxes.</blockquote>
<p>These proceedings were naturally found very oppressive by the
inhabitants of the country: multitudes fled for security to the
Ionian Islands, while the peasantry sought protection against the
military marauders by abandoning the village for the fortress,
and sometimes even the field for the cave.</p>
<p>The representatives of Great Britain, France, and Russia, the
three Powers to whom Greece owed its existence, found it much
harder to protect than it had been to create their offspring.
They stood helpless before this scene of anarchy, hesitating to
act, and, when at last forced into action, taking it without
effect. France had already landed troops in the Morea, and the
Allies therefore possessed, nominally at any rate, the power to
intervene by force of arms for the pacification of the distracted
country, but their intervention, when it did take place, only
made confusion worse confounded. Before the Commission had held
power for a month they felt their position so insecure that they
found it necessary to invite the French troops to occupy Nauplia
and Patras as the only means of assuring their personal safety
and the prolongation of their power. The former measure was
successfully accomplished; but before the French arrived at
Patras the place had been seized by the Capodistrians.</p>
<p>Nothing could have been simpler than the mode of its capture.
The Greek troops by which it was garrisoned were well affected to
the Commission, as they had previously been to the Capodistrians,
and as, to do them justice, they would have been to any political
party or person who would guarantee them their pay. But this the
Commission had most unwisely allowed to fall into arrear; it was
even rumoured that they were to be disbanded; and 'while they
were brooding over this report' they heard that French troops had
been invited to garrison Patras, a piece of intelligence which
seemed to render their prospect of payment more uncertain than
ever. In the mood produced by it, it was not difficult to
convince them that patriotism forbade the surrender of an
important place of arms to the foreigner. The Commission had
accused the Capodistrians of selling Greece to the Russians; the
Capodistrians now retorted by accusing the Commission of selling
Nauplia and Patras to the French. Upon this hint the Greek
garrison mutinied, and deposed their commander, who refused to
sign a manifesto justifying the revolt; and a patriot of the name
of Zavellas, who had fought with bravery against the Turks in the
war of liberation, but whose political position at this moment is
more than usually hard to define, was invited by them to assume
the chief command at Patras. Zavellas, who was at the head of 500
irregulars, and who would not have been a Greek if he had
declined an opportunity of making himself master of the persons
and property of the inhabitants of a flourishing seaport,
accepted the offer with alacrity, and, hastening to Patras,
entered it before the arrival of the French. When they made their
appearance he transmitted to their commanding officer a formal
protest against the authority of the governing Commission, and
refused to obey the order to admit the French into the fortress.
The French commander, considering that, as the Allies had
despatched him to Patras for the purpose of maintaining order, it
would hardly be consistent with his mission to come to blows with
any party who should have succeeded in obtaining the undisputed
mastery of the place, withdrew his troops, leaving Zavellas in
peaceable possession.</p>
<p>Having thus brought down to the summer of 1832 the turbulent
history of this distracted little kingdom, we may once more
return to Franklin. It has been necessary to enter with some
minuteness into the course of local politics at Patras in order
that the extremely delicate part which he had to play in
connection with that port, its trade, and its inhabitants, may be
rendered intelligible. His duties in the Mediterranean, however,
had commenced more than eighteen months before the latest of the
events just recorded. It was on August 30, 1830, that he was
appointed to the command of the 26-gun frigate Rainbow, and on
November 11 of the same year that she put to sea.</p>
<p>A backward glance at the chronology of the events concisely
summarised in the foregoing pages may be necessary in order to
recall the situation when Franklin's mission commenced. Prince
Leopold's resignation of the sovereignty was now an incident some
three months old; and the political disquietude of the new
kingdom had approached just so much the nearer to actual anarchy,
while the relations of the two Western Powers with their Eastern
ally were just so much the further from those of mutual
confidence. President Capo d'Istria, it seemed, was more and more
openly showing a hand, which was the hand of Russia; and indeed,
before Franklin had been many months in the Mediterranean, Russia
herself had, by the conduct of her naval officers, given the
strongest colour to the suspicion that she was playing a. game of
her own. In the summer of 1831, the municipality of the island of
Hydra, which had revolted against the President, and which he was
meditating how to reduce to submission by naval operations,
suddenly turned the tables on him by seizing the greater part of
the Greek fleet, then lying disarmed in the port of Poros.</p>
<p>Upon this, Capo d'Istria appealed to the Russian Admiral
Ricord, then at Nauplia with his squadron, the French and English
commanders being absent, to come to his assistance, an appeal to
which the Admiral responded by sailing straightway to Poros and
summoning the insurgents to surrender the ships and the arsenal
to the Greek Government. The demand was refused, but before any
action was taken on either side the French and English naval
commanders chanced to put into the port on their way back to
Nauplia, and on learning the condition of affairs agreed with
Ricord and Miaulis, the insurgent leader, that the <i>status
quo</i> should be maintained until they had had time to go to
Nauplia and procure instructions from the diplomatic
representatives of the Allies. This, however, was much as though
two cats should go off to consult the wishes of the dairyman,
leaving a third cat bound by an honourable undertaking to
maintain a <i>status quo</i> with the cream bowl. The arrangement
had its natural result. Before the French and English commanders
could execute their mission Admiral Ricord prepared to attack the
port, a movement to which the insurgents responded by blowing up
the finest of the ships in their possession to prevent their
capture. Meanwhile, the troops of Capo d'Istria, who were
besieging the fort from the land side, rushed into the town and
sacked it for twenty-four hours under the eyes and guns of
Admiral Ricord and his squadron.</p>
<p>Franklin himself was at a considerable distance from the scene
of these operations; for the Rainbow during the year 1831 was
stationed mainly at Corfu. But the English naval commander with
whom the Russian Admiral had kept such peculiarly Punic faith was
Captain (afterwards Sir Edmund) Lyons, an intimate friend and
frequent correspondent of Franklin's; and this circumstance may
have deepened the resentment and distrust of Russia with which
the affair of Poros generally inspired English naval officers in
the Mediterranean. Later on it will be seen that the captain of
the Rainbow was himself to have a taste of his friend's
experience, and to find himself called upon to exert all his tact
and vigilance for the defeat of Russian intrigue.</p>
<p>For the present, however, and for some time to come, the
duties imposed upon him were light enough. His first destination
in the Mediterranean was Malta, from which station he was at the
end of January ordered to Nauplia, and while here he had an
opportunity of paying a visit to Athens. This visit produced upon
him, as it has upon so many other men before and since, a
disenchanting effect. He had been despatched with his vessel to
the Greek capital as the bearer of letters to Ismail Bey, the
Turkish Commissioner for the affairs of Greece, and after
executing his mission he seems to have 'done' the city and its
antiquities with as much thoroughness as an unofficial tourist.
Athens he found 'a mass of ruins, not having more than three
houses habitable'&mdash;a result of the different bombardments
which it had undergone at the hands of both Turks and Greeks. Nor
did he omit to record the injuries which it had suffered at the
hands of that third nationality whose name Macaulay united in a
famous passage with those of the other two. 'It must be
confessed', he writes to Lady Franklin, 'that the pleasure we
feel on looking at this famous edifice (the Parthenon) is mingled
with a kind of indignation at the wanton rapacity of the Elgins
and other mutilators of the sacred Temple.'</p>
<p>But the disillusionising experience of his visit to the Greek
capital had begun earlier still, as regards the Greek people and
their political leaders. The prepossession in their favour which
nearly all Englishmen of that date entertained had been seriously
shaken before he left Nauplia for Athens:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I was formerly a Philhellene, a warm admirer of their
cause, but I must confess the short residence I have had at the
seat of government has somewhat cooled my ardour, since I have
found that the leading Greeks, instead of uniting and doing their
utmost to restore the agricultural and other useful occupations
of the country, seem to be squabbling for power and places of
trust, and all of them, either statesmen or would-be statesmen,
soldiers or would-be soldiers, strolling about the streets of
Naples, apparently idle, or occupied only by dress and
parade.</blockquote>
<p>His impression, too, of the very foremost of these statesmen,
the President himself, was no less unfavourable, though on
different grounds. After mentioning the civilities he had
received from the foreign Ministers and the 'leading persons
here' in general, he adds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Capo d'Istria, however, is to be excepted, for he
neither deigned to return my call nor to take any notice of me;
but I do not feel this, as he is apt to treat others in the same
way, and is an excessively unpopular man, and, it is said, most
thoroughly dislikes the English, whom he considers as the main
bar to the accomplishment of his arbitrary and selfish wishes. I
have been told that his measures have been generally disapproved
of by the Greeks, as it is likely they would be, on account of
his having removed the most influential of the Greeks (and
especially those who were the first promoters of the Revolution)
from all places of trust and power, and put in minions and
creatures of his own. The country of Maina is in insurrection
against him.</blockquote>
<p>It was, indeed, by the hand of a Mainote that, a few months
after these words were written, Capo d'Istria was to fall.
Franklin, however, had left Nauplia some time before the
assassination took place. He was ordered back to Malta about the
middle of March 1831, whence, after a stay of some six weeks, he
was despatched to Corfu, where he remained for nearly a year. It
was not till the Governing Commission which had succeeded in
wresting the reins of government from the feeble hands of the
younger Capo d'Istria and his colleagues had proved themselves
incapable of maintaining order, and the whole of liberated Greece
was being desolated by anarchy, that the services of the Rainbow
were called into active requisition. But in the spring of 1832,
as has been related in the summarised narrative of events with
which this chapter opens, matters were at their worst. 'Liberated
Greece was at that moment anything but free. The Turks had been
expelled from the country, but the people were groaning under
worse oppressors and a heavier yoke. The whole substance of the
land was devoured by hosts of soldiers, sailors, captains,
generals, policemen, Government officials, secretaries, and
political adventurers, all living idly at the public expense,
while the agricultural population was dying of famine.' It was at
the crisis of this miserable state of things that the Rainbow was
ordered, for the protection of life and property, to the port of
Patras, shortly afterwards to become the scene of the events
above recorded, and that Franklin was to have the opportunity of
showing those high diplomatic qualities of firmness and tact
which won for him the warm commendation of his official
superiors. Meanwhile, however, he remained at his station off
Corfu exchanging letters with Lady Franklin, not yet started on
those Mediterranean travels of which she reported her experiences
and impressions to her husband and sometimes to her sister in
that picturesque and animated style which lends such unfailing
charm to her correspondence. The state of her health at that time
was causing some concern, and she was staying at Brighton for its
benefit. But she was full of eagerness to be with her husband at
the earliest moment, and their letters to each other often reveal
an amusing game of cross purposes; Lady Franklin suggesting every
expedient possible or imaginable for rejoining him, and the less
impulsive Franklin gravely pointing out the impediments,
professional and other, to her various plans. During the early
months of 1831 she had other subjects to occupy her mind.</p>
<p>The new King had just been paying a visit to Brighton,
attended by the usual gaieties at the Pavilion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>People here are living with their eyes staring, and
their mouths gaping towards Royalty. There has been a party at
the Palace of eight or nine hundred people, and Miss Langton was
at it. The King talked to her a good deal, and she mentioned your
name. 'I know him,' said the King; 'he is a very amiable man, but
he is more than that, a man of great ability and an excellent
sailor.' Miss Langton said, 'Lady Franklin is here.' 'Show her to
me. Let me speak to her. Bring her up to me.' On Miss Langton's
explaining, he said he was sorry I was not there, and must come
next time. 'Give her my commands that she come to the children's
ball, and bring her little girl with her.' So Ella and I are
going, thus flatteringly invited, and my only discomfort is that
I have no one to go with.</blockquote>
<p>On February 18, in reply to a letter from Franklin, who had
been giving her some account of Maltese society, she
writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>You describe everybody alike, as being so amiable and
agreeable, that I cannot tell one from the other, and by that
means do not care for any of them. Suppose you try your hand next
time on some spirited sketches of character and
portrait-painting. I know you <i>can</i>, if you will. As it is,
they all go in a bag together, and tumble out all alike. I am
much pleased, however, with all you say about Dr. C, and am
willing to give him credit for every merit you endow him with.
Pray give him, therefore, my special remembrance. I never
disliked him, nor did I ever think so meanly of him as you
imagine, and in the midst even of his lackadaisical manner there
was a degree of brightness and drollery in his eyes which belied
it. . . . I read your long letter to my aunt, and I think it
amused her to think what a good husband I had got. How could she
be so foolish? I had half a mind to tell her that you dearly
loved writing long letters, and that you wrote long letters and
the same things to everybody; but I stopped myself, for fear that
she should more than half believe me. Indeed, though, my dear,
you are a very wonderful man, for you can write about the same
things to everybody, with a patience which surprises me. What an
irritable, impatient creature am I in comparison! For I could not
write about the same thing twice over, even to you, and
consequently nothing is so terrible to me as to have the news of
a marriage or anything else which requires I detail to spread
about among expectant relations and friends. I should like to
have a copying machine, and dash off the sheets by the dozen. . .
. Captain Rideout told me he had not been near the Admiralty
lately. He considered it perfectly useless. They were doing and
undoing, and there was nothing but fluctuation and confusion. I
think you are a happy man to be where you are. I hope you will
have an opportunity of confirming Sir Pulteney Malcolm's good
opinion of you, and that you will be in the good graces of the
new Admiral, Hotham. How is he related to the nice deaf old man
who was as much pleased or obliged by your gentlemanly and kind
refusal, as he would have been by some ruder captain's consent?
Oh, what a coaxing, smooth-tongued rogue you are! I have got his
letter by me, and was looking at it the other day. Who would
think, my dear, that you had lived among the Polar
bears?</blockquote>
<p>But now at last the period of 'active' service in something
more than the nominal and technical sense arrived for Franklin.
The critical spring of 1832 had come; the Allied Powers, their
diplomacy quickened by the spectacle of the ever-deepening
demoralisation of the Greek people, had agreed on the nomination
of Prince Otho of Bavaria to the newly created throne, and, in
response to the representations addressed to them from Greece
itself, were preparing to exert themselves in real earnest for
the pacification of the country. In the last days of March or the
first of April Franklin was ordered from Corfu to Patras, and his
first despatch from that port to the naval Commander-in-Chief in
the Mediterranean shows the official instructions he had received
and the steps which he had already taken in execution of them.
The Roumeliot insurgents were meditating, or believed to be
meditating, an attempt to cross the Gulf from Lepanto, with a
view to the seizure of either Drepano or Vostitza, and the
Governor of Patras had appealed to the Allied Powers to use their
naval forces for the protection of the Morean coast. No doubt
there was all the vagueness which usually prevails in such cases
as to the precise scope either of the request or of the assent to
it, or possibly of both. There was, at any rate, all the opening
which in such cases frequently presents itself for the suggestion
by one of the Allies of a more 'active' policy than was agreeable
to the others.</p>
<p>Franklin's first step on his arrival off Patras was to compare
notes of instructions with his French and Russian colleagues, and
he of course found, on conferring with them, that, so far as
words went, 'their unanimity was wonderful'. They were all three
agreed, that is to say, that they were to confine themselves to
the exertion of 'moral influence'; and Franklin was 'happy to
find' that, on the question of the particular mode in which this
influence was to be exerted, the sentiments of the French
commander, Captain Fournier, were in entire accord with his own.
Captain Leroff, however, of the Russian brig, 'appeared from his
questions and observations' to place a somewhat different
construction on these two important words. This officer
'intimated the wish if not the intention to detain every boat
that might be found carrying provisions or other supplies without
having papers signed by the proper Greek authorities'; and he
further thought that if the Roumeliots should attempt to cross
the gulf, the 'moral influence' to be brought to bear upon them
should take the form of 'opposing their passage by force'.
Captains Franklin and Fournier, however, did not feel themselves
called upon in their view of their duties to take even the former
and milder step, while, as to the latter, 'we at once declared
that it would be contrary to our instructions.'</p>
<p>No urgent necessity for taking 'concerted' action on this
variously construed mandate was, for the present, to arise. A
question of more immediate concern to Franklin as a British naval
officer presented itself instead. On April 12 a complaint was
addressed to Mr. Crowe, our Consul at Patras, and by him
transmitted to Franklin, to the effect that a demand for 'an
arbitrary and illegal contribution had been made on several
Ionian merchants', subjects, of course, at that time of the
British Crown, by the Governor of Patras, and that, on their
refusal to pay, a party of soldiers had been quartered on their
houses, with orders to seize upon their property for the
maintenance of the troops until the money was paid. One of them
having goods to land from a vessel, the duty on which nearly
amounted to the sum demanded, made the payment required. Another
persisted in his refusal, with the result that the fifteen
soldiers quartered upon him turned his wife and family out of
their rooms, seized upon some butter belonging to him and sold
it, demanded wine, and 'abused the family with the most insulting
language.' A third recalcitrant had ten soldiers in his house,
who 'took his cloak and two guns and put them in pledge for wine
and victuals', and two others were similarly treated.</p>
<p>On being informed of these high-handed proceedings, Franklin
immediately waited upon the British Consul and found him in the
act of writing to protest against them. Having waited the return
of the bearer of this letter, and finding that no immediate
answer was to be given to it, Franklin called upon the Governor,
'to demand an explanation of these extraordinary proceedings, and
to insist that either the soldiers should be withdrawn or the
parties complaining should be permitted to embark their goods and
families and place themselves under my protection if they chose
to do so.' The account of the interview which followed is given
in Franklin's despatch book, with remonstrance and reply in
parallel columns, and the dramatic contrast which it presents
between dogged British pertinacity and inexhaustible Levantine
shiftiness is decidedly amusing:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><i>Sir John Franklin</i> states that he called
officially on the Governor to say that he had received an
official communication from H.M. Consul, informing him that an
arbitrary and illegal contribution had been levied on some Ionian
merchants, and that, upon their refusing to comply with it,
military force had been used to compel them;<br>
<br>
That he felt it his duty to demand that the soldiers be
immediately removed from the Ionians' houses, and that, if the
merchants chose, they should be permitted to embark their
families and effects, and place them under his protection, and
that time should be allowed to communicate with H.M. Resident and
Admiral at Nauplia on the subject.<br>
<br>
<i>The Governor</i> explained that he had received a
communication from H.M. Consul on the subject, to which he would
reply;<br>
<br>
That he could not allow the embarkation of the effects or remove
the soldiers until the Ionians paid the sums which had been
assigned to them in the contribution.<br>
<br>
<i>Sir John Franklin</i> hoped that the Governor was prepared for
the responsibility he would incur from the measures of force
which it might be necessary to resort to in consequence of force
having been used;<br>
<br>
That the Residents and Admirals of the Allied Powers had
recommended a system of conciliation, and every effort to
maintain tranquillity, that he regretted extremely such measures
on the part of the Government here, which had quite a contrary
tendency, and that it pained him to reflect on what might be the
result of the measures he might be compelled to adopt in
consequence of the refusal of the Governor.<br>
<br>
He again requested that the soldiers might be removed until
communication could be had with the Resident and Admiral on the
subject.<br>
<br>
<i>The Governor</i> stated that this contribution was not levied
on the Ionians alone, that it was on the merchants generally, and
that they were in all forty individuals, among whom were only
seven Ionians, and that he would not remove the soldiers until
the money was paid.</blockquote>
<p>This, of course, amounted in substance to an admission that
the levy was compulsory, and to a contention that the Ionians
were liable to it in common with the Greeks of the new
kingdom.</p>
<blockquote><i>Sir John Franklin</i> said that this town was not
in presence of an enemy, or menaced by an enemy, to warrant any
such contribution, and that it was extremely ungracious to act in
such a manner towards the subjects of one of the Allied Powers
who had sent vessels to this place for its special protection and
the maintenance of tranquillity, and who had also abstained from
taking any part in the disputes between Greek and Greek.<br>
<br>
He again begged the Governor to reflect on the responsibility he
would incur by persisting in the refusal to remove the soldiers
or to permit the embarkation of the Ionians, with their families
and effects.<br>
<br>
<i>The Governor</i> said that this was not a contribution, but a
voluntary loan agreed upon at a public meeting, that eight
Ionians had paid and only two had refused, and that he would not
remove the soldiers until the money was paid.</blockquote>
<p>Here it will be observed that the tax has now become a
'benevolence', and that, though 'only seven Ionians' were subject
to it, eight have paid it, leaving over a mere insignificant
fraction of 'two' who refused to pay. The English of this very
'Greek' statement was, as appeared from the result of later
official inquiries, that the demand had been in fact made upon
five Ionians, of whom two had paid and three had refused.</p>
<blockquote><i>Sir John Franklin</i> said that if such a measure
had been intended to be a general one it should have been
announced by proclamation, and communication made to H.M. Consul
of the same.<br>
<br>
<i>The Governor</i> replied that he did not think it his duty to
have made such communication, as the measure had been agreed upon
at a meeting of the Greek and Ionian merchants, who voluntarily
offered to lend the Government the money, and that only two had
now refused what they had previously consented to.</blockquote>
<p>Here, again, the Governor's Greek is thus 'Englished' in the
Vice-Consul's subsequent report: 'A meeting at the Municipality
was held of the merchants of this town yesterday, April 11, and
one or two Ionian merchants were summoned to attend, but none
complied.'</p>
<blockquote><i>Sir John Franklin</i> said that if the Governor
did not feel it his duty to make the communication generally
known, common courtesy required that he should do so to the
representatives of the Powers who had taken so great an interest
in the tranquillity and welfare of Greece.<br>
<br>
He again required the removal of the soldiers, or permission for
the embarkation of the families and effects of the Ionians. Sir
John Franklin hoped it was not true that the soldiers had taken
possession of their effects.<br>
<br>
<i>The Governor</i> repeated that he did not think it necessary
to make any communication when the arrangement had been
voluntary, and when eight out of ten had paid the sums subscribed
['subscribed' is a happy word], and two only were refractory.<br>
<br>
And that it was not true that soldiers had taken possession of
the effects of the Ionians.<br>
<br>
<i>Sir John Franklin</i> stated that he had not been informed
that eight out of the Ionians had paid the sums, or consented to
pay, that he would consult with the Consul on the subject, but
that he felt it his duty to protect the two who objected to pay,
and to demand permission to embark their families and effects if
they chose, and for them to come under his protection.<br>
<br>
<i>The Governor</i> said that he would have consented to the
demands of the Consul and Sir John if the measure had been taken
for the Ionians alone; but in this case the Ionians had agreed
with the Greeks to advance to the Government the money, and two
only were refractory.<br>
<br>
That he would allow the embarkation of their effects, except as
to such value as would cover the amount they had to
pay.</blockquote>
<p>It would seem here from the use of the word 'advance' that
this singular impost had undergone a further modification. Having
developed from a tax into a 'benevolence', it had now blossomed
out into a 'loan'. Had the Governor been pressed a little harder,
he might perhaps have represented it as a 'bounty' from the
Government to the Ionian merchants. Meanwhile it was at least
satisfactory to find that the Governor's second enumeration of
these persons, though it corresponded to nothing in the facts,
had undergone no further change.</p>
<blockquote><i>Sir John Franklin</i> stated that he felt the same
duty to protect one British or Ionian subject as he would have
done to protect 500; that he regretted extremely that the harmony
and good understanding which H.M. Resident at Nauplia held with
the Provisional Government of Greece, and therefore expected to
be observed by all other authorities, was so opposite to the
conduct of the authorities here as to produce on his part the
remonstrance he was compelled to make; and again begged the
Governor to reflect on the responsibility he incurred, and the
consequence which might result from the continued refusal to
allow the embarkation of the property and families of the
Ionians, or the removal of the soldiers from their houses.<br>
<br>
He again desired that the Governor would remove the soldiers
until communication could be made through the Residents to the
Provisional Government on the subject.<br>
<br>
<i>The Governor</i> replied that he wished the harmony and good
understanding might be preserved, and gave his thanks to the
Allies that they had sent vessels here for the protection of the
town.<br>
<br>
He agreed to permit the embarkation of the effects of the
Ionians, as they had other property to secure the payment of the
money they had to pay;<br>
<br>
But that he would not remove the soldiers until they paid the
money, or until he had an order from the Provisional Government
on the subject.<br>
<br>
<i>Sir John Franklin</i> stated again that the views of the
Allies were to preserve tranquillity in Greece, but that the
measures resorted to by the Governor had a directly contrary
tendency.</blockquote>
<p>At this point the Governor seems to have made the only 'hit',
such as it was&mdash;and it consisted, as will be seen, in what
lawyers call 'taking advantage of his own wrong'&mdash;which he
succeeded in scoring during the whole interview. He coolly
replied</p>
<blockquote>that he had taken this step for the purpose of
preserving tranquillity by supplying the wants of the troops, who
might otherwise pillage the town, and from this the Ionians as
well as the Greeks might be the sufferers.</blockquote>
<p>His measures, in fact, preserved tranquillity in the sense
that levying 'blackmail' prevents breaches of the law by acts of
brigandage. He concluded with the declaration&mdash;wholly
unwarrantable, of course, in international law&mdash;that he
'considered the Ionians on the same footing as Greek subjects,
and liable to the same fiscal regulations.'</p>
<blockquote><i>Sir John Franklin</i> demanded whether the
embarkation of the families and effects of the two who refused
might be considered as permitted.<br>
<br>
<i>The Governor</i> answered in the affirmative.<br>
<br>
<i>Sir John Franklin</i> then demanded a passport for a courier
to Nauplia.<br>
<br>
<i>The Governor</i> was ready to grant it.<br>
<br>
<i>Sir John Franklin</i> again expressed his regret at being
obliged to make such a remonstrance against a violation of the
rights of the Ionian subjects; and could not express the pain
which the reflection on the consequences which might result gave
him. He would consult with the Consul on the subject of the
conference, and hoped that the Governor would give an answer to
the Consul's letter.<br>
<br>
<i>The Governor</i> was equally sorry at the circumstance, but
could not withdraw the demand [for the contribution]. He would
forthwith send a reply to Mr. Crowe.</blockquote>
<p>Thus ended this singular interview, technically, no doubt in a
drawn battle; but as the Ionian merchants, with their goods and
families, were removed under the protection of the British flag,
the substantial gains of victory may fairly be said to have
rested with Franklin. In the covering despatch forwarded to the
Admiralty with the above-quoted report of this conference,
Franklin adds that the Governor, in at last assenting to the
removal of the merchants, 'intimated', dryly enough, 'that their
houses would remain.' What happened to this portion of their
property, or what indeed was the sequel of the incident
generally, does not appear; but some time, probably, before the
courier despatched to Nauplia could have returned with
instructions from the Residents, stirring events had occurred at
Patras, and the authority of the Governor had, no doubt, come to
an end. It is, at any rate, certain that after a few days'
delay&mdash;during which period, however, he seems to have
actually removed the two merchants from their houses to the
citadel&mdash;he fulfilled his undertaking to Franklin. From a
despatch of the 18th it appears that, on the receipt of
intelligence to the effect that there had been some change in the
members of the Government at Nauplia, the Governor of Patras had
released the Ionian merchants from their confinement in the
citadel without enforcing the payment of the contribution which
had been demanded of them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>
<p align="center">BEFORE PATRAS<br>
<br>
1832-1834</p>
<p><small>AFFAIRS</small> at Patras were now rapidly approaching
a crisis. April 19, the date of the seizure of the town by
Zavellas and his irregulars, as above narrated, was now near at
hand; and the shadow of the coming event is plainly visible in
Franklin's communications with his official chiefs. On the 17th
the uneasy authorities, civil and military, of the town made a
formal application to the French and British naval commanders to
land troops for the preservation of order, meaning thereby, of
course, the maintenance of their own tottering rule. They wished
these troops, as they put it, to act in concert with the regular
garrison to repress any predatory action against the town which,
it was feared, might be made by the irregular troops. Franklin
and Fournier immediately sought an interview with the Civil
Governor, and satisfied themselves that, having regard to the
suspicious movements of the irregulars, there was good ground for
the Governor's apprehension that they would take advantage of the
approaching Easter festivities to enter the town under pretence
of joining in the celebration, but in reality to plunder the
inhabitants. The military commandant, who entered during the
interview, added, it is true, that, now that he had procured the
means of paying the troops of the garrison 'up to a certain
time', he could rely upon them for the defence of the citadel
and, 'perhaps', of the town, though he must admit that the
landing of a force from the allied ships would give greater
encouragement to the troops, and entire confidence to the
inhabitants of the town. It appeared to the two naval officers
that, notwithstanding the confidence of the military commandant,
the troops of the garrison, even though assured of their pay 'up
to a certain time', might not be proof against the temptation to
provide for a more remote future, and that 'if the pillage once
commenced on the part of the irregular soldiery, those of the
garrison would join them.' They therefore determined on acceding
to the petition of the inhabitants to land some men from each
ship of the allied squadron. Before doing so, however, Franklin
took the two following very judicious precautions. In the first
place, he framed and furnished the officers and men of the
landing party with a very carefully drawn and minute code of
instructions as to the proceedings to be taken and the rules to
be observed by them during the period of the occupation; and, in
the next place, he prepared the following proclamation for issue
by the civil authorities of Patras to the inhabitants of the
town:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The captains of the ships of the Alliance, in
compliance with the wishes of the inhabitants, and at the request
of the authorities of Patras, are about to land some troops. This
debarkation has no political object whatever, and is only done to
prevent all kinds of disorder. The captains, therefore, trust
that the inhabitants and the military will conduct themselves in
such a manner as not to render necessary the employment of force
on their part for the maintenance of tranquillity.<br>
<br>
Given under my hand, on board the Rainbow, at Patras, this 17th
of April, 1832.                 (Signed)    <small>JOHN
FRANKLIN</small>, Captain.</blockquote>
<p>On the same day the English and French troops were landed.
They consisted of 47 seamen and 23 Marines from the Rainbow, and
15 seamen and 16 Marines from the Pelican. The French landed 40
seamen, thus bringing up the total force to 141 men, exclusive of
officers.</p>
<p>The next step was to seek an interview with the disquieting
Zavellas, and to prevail upon him, if possible, to restrain the
exuberant cupidity of his irregulars. The patriot was gracious to
the point of condescension, but showed no great eagerness to
impart information nor any conspicuous readiness to pledge
himself to a strictly pacific action. Probably he was already
meditating the coup which he struck a few days later.</p>
<p>He was, however, quite willing to give all due and becoming
assurances that the preservation of peace and tranquillity, not
only in Patras, but throughout Greece, was the object nearest to
his patriotic heart. None of his men, he said, should come into
the town, unless it might be some few who had families there and
who might come in to purchase provisions. On the French Consul,
who acted as interpreter, repeating the request that he would
keep his men away, the General dramatically&mdash;or
melodramatically&mdash;answered: 'The word of a Zavellas is to be
depended upon. I am a soldier, and have never been known to break
my trust. I am well known. I am that Zavellas who headed the
Suliote rising. I am known in history.' The French Consul asked
him how many men he had, to which the historic soldier made the
not very direct answer that they were divided about Vostitza and
the vicinity:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><i>French Consul</i>: But let us know the exact
number.<br>
<br>
<i>General Zavellas</i>: About 700 men.<br>
<br>
<i>French Consul</i>: How many men have you here, as it is
necessary we should know, that we may be able to perceive if any
more arrive?<br>
<br>
<i>General Zavellas</i>: They are all officers who live in this
place and have their families here.<br>
<br>
<i>French Consul</i>: But what may be their number?<br>
<br>
<i>General Zavellas</i>: About fifty (with <i>some
hesitation</i>); with their retinue, 200.</blockquote>
<p>The General went on to say that all the Allies could do was
only to secure a temporary tranquillity, and that until the
Prince arrived to occupy the throne of Greece they might take his
word for it that Greece would never be quiet. The Consul then, by
way of encouraging the hope of an early pacification, informed
him that a commission was being formed to manage the government
of the country until the arrival of the sovereign, which
commission, the General might rely upon it, would do all in its
power to secure the orderly administration of affairs. General
Zavellas, however, was so rude as to reply that 'Greece had had
enough of commissions. He knew what they were; they had no means
of enforcing their power. Give them money, give them money, and
then something might be done.' The Consul said that every one
should be perfectly disinterested and merely look to the general
welfare of Greece, The General said that 'when he fought the
Turks, then it was that he looked to the general welfare of
Greece.' The Consul then told the General that the Residents of
the Allies would be provided with a loan of money to issue, but
'they did not yet know to whom it should be given, as it was
their desire only to apply the loan to the interests of Greece.'
The General answered that 'it was of little import to whom the
money was given provided it made its appearance in the country.'
He did not add 'to be scrambled for', but his meaning is
sufficiently clear without that addition.</p>
<p>Franklin had another interview with this notable on the
following day, to suggest that, in the peculiar circumstances of
the situation, he should direct his irregulars to refrain from
celebrating Easter, as they were accustomed to do, by firing
volleys of musketry, which he promised to do.</p>
<p>The action taken by the allied squadron achieved its object.
Order reigned in Patras throughout the Eastertide festival. The
irregulars did not celebrate the festival by pillaging the town,
and the townspeople gradually recovered their confidence. But
after the lapse of some ten or twelve days a change took place in
the aspect of affairs which compelled the two commanders to
reconsider their policy. The attitude of Zavellas had become more
and more threatening, and in the last days of April his designs
were unmistakably disclosed. A communication was addressed by the
civil authorities of Patras to Franklin and his colleague,
Captain Dupont, who had succeeded Fournier in the command, to the
effect that Zavellas had definitely refused obedience to the
orders of the Governing Commission, that he had disobeyed the
directions transmitted to him through the Governor of Patras to
retire his troops to a distance from the town, and that it was
his intention, as they were positively informed, to seize the
citadel, provision it by levying contributions on the villages,
and hold it and the town which it dominated until the arrival of
the King-designate of Greece in his new dominions.</p>
<p>Upon consideration of this grave intelligence, Franklin and
Dupont came to the conclusion that no course was open to them but
to re-embark their troops. It was out of their power to land any
force sufficiently strong to prevent the entrance of Zavellas and
his irregulars into the town if he chose to make the attempt with
the whole strength of his following. It was known, too, that he
was conspiring with the garrison, and it was probable, as indeed
the event proved, that its troops would throw in their lot with
him on his making his appearance. And lastly, most important
consideration of all, the orders given to the allied captains
expressly forbade their making any promise of material support to
one party or threat of coercion to the other, and that no
circumstance whatever, except insult to their respective flags,
was to authorise or induce them to use force. Consequently,
though it may well be believed with some reluctance, the two
officers resolved to issue a proclamation to the people of
Patras, stating that, in view of the present tranquillity of the
town, and of the fact of the men being required for their duties
on board, it had been decided to re-embark them. This
proclamation was issued on April 30, and, the step announced, it
was at once executed.</p>
<p>There could be no question of its wisdom, or indeed, having
regard to the numerical inferiority of the troops of the allied
squadron&mdash;150 men against some seven or eight
hundred&mdash;of its necessity either. But that Franklin
regretted the restraint imposed upon him by circumstances it is
easy to see; and it is pretty certain that, with a clearer
mandate of intervention and a more adequate force, he would not
have hesitated to make himself master of the town, and thus
secure the 'preservation of tranquillity' in the most effectual
of all ways This appears clearly enough in the disappointment
afterwards evinced by him at the retreat of the French contingent
sent to take possession of the town on May 19. In an extremely
interesting despatch some months later to the Commander of the
Mediterranean fleet he shows, in answering a series of inquiries
which Sir Henry Hotham had addressed to him, how actively he and
his colleague had exerted themselves to facilitate the French
occupation of Patras. Captain Dupont had sent two couriers by
different routes to meet the Commander of the French troops, to
apprise him of the exact state of Patras, and to communicate to
him their joint opinion as to the quarter from which they could
most advantageously for themselves, and most effectively
supported by the guns of the squadron, advance upon the town.
'You will imagine my disappointment', he writes, 'at hearing the
French General's determination, which was first communicated to
me on my going on board his ship, taking M. Ruffa with me, who
had informed me only a little before that he could at once place
300 men at the General's disposal and 500 in five days, which I
thought of importance he should know.' But the French General had
committed the signal and singular blunder of preceding the force
under his command, and, writes Franklin: 'I repeat my conviction
that if the French General had not thus come, Patras would have
been at once given up to the French troops. His having made the
demand for the surrender of the fortress before the troops were
on the spot appears to me extraordinary, and I was not surprised
at the answer Zavellas returned to his letters. His ordering the
troops to retire when within six hours' march of Patras was still
more inexplicable to me, and I am sure it had the effect of
emboldening Zavellas and his followers to persevere in their
opposition.'</p>
<p>Regrets, however, were vain. Diplomatic timidity and military
irresolution had allowed this Greek condottiere to make himself
master of a leading commercial seaport of Greece, of the lives
and goods of its inhabitants, and of a considerable amount of
property or proprietary interests belonging to the subjects of
other States. Thenceforth, therefore, until the final or what was
supposed to be the final settlement of the Greek question by the
arrival of Prince Otho of Bavaria and his Council of Regency in
the early months of the following year, the position of Sir John
Franklin was one demanding the exercise of sleepless vigilance,
inexhaustible patience, infinite tact, imperturbable temper, and
unfailing promptitude. The situation, in fact, was really almost
comic in its perplexity and involution; and even in its worst and
most irritating entanglements there are many signs that Franklin
was not insensible to its humorous aspects. His despatches, which
are models of the clear and businesslike style befitting such
documents, and his private letters, abounding in shrewd
observation and reflection, to Sir Henry Hotham are, for the next
six months, so interesting as to make selection difficult. But
the difficult is here the unavoidable also; for they fill several
manuscript books of correspondence and would, in type, go far to
fill a considerable volume, which, indeed they deserve.</p>
<p>Let us briefly survey the situation in which the captain of
the Rainbow now found himself. In front of him lay a considerable
commercial seaport in the hands of a captain of Greek irregulars
and his men, whose proceedings, so far as they menaced the lives
or properties of British subjects or the honour of the British
flag, it would be his duty to restrain if possible by 'moral
influence', but if not, then, in circumstances incapable alike of
prediction or of definition, by the use of material force. Behind
the town, so to speak&mdash;that is at the seat of the Central
Greek Executive so called&mdash;stood a Provisional Government,
which Franklin was instructed to co-operate with and assist in
the exercise of an authority recognised and obeyed precisely by
that portion of the Greek people whose self-interest or
indifference induced them to do so, and by nobody else. In his
own rear&mdash;that is to say, at the source of that
international authority which was then nominally directing the
affairs of Greece&mdash;were three Great Powers, agreed indeed as
to the future of the new kingdom, but quite unable to grapple
with its present disorders, and two of them filled with a
profound and not unreasonable distrust of the third. By his side
were two naval colleagues, of whom one, the French commander, was
to be relied on for loyal co-operation, but the other was
vehemently, and indeed on the strongest grounds, suspected of
intriguing with the Greek political faction whose adherents were
then in possession of the town.</p>
<p>Were it necessary to add a finishing touch to this picture of
confusion, the following passage from one of Franklin's private
letters to Sir Henry Hotham's secretary would supply
it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I heartily wish the authorities on whom the
termination of the Greek affair rests would speedily decide on
what is to be done. Nothing can be more wearying for the mind and
temper than to witness the vacillating measures which have been
recently followed in these matters. There are three places, for
instance, within sight of this anchorage occupied by persons
acknowledging three different authorities: Patras by Zavellas, in
avowed opposition to the Government; Missolonghi by Grivas,
professing to be acting for the Government, but really, I
believe, for himself; and Lepanto, divided between the troops of
Lambro Vecchio, who have faithfully adhered to the Government,
and a party professing to be rather inclined to the Government
but opposed personally to the views of the commandant, Lambro
Vecchio.</blockquote>
<p>The case, it will be here seen, was even worse than Franklin
put it; since the anti-Lambro faction may fairly be regarded as a
fourth party. And, considering that they occupied 'the lower
town' with their opponents 'holding the citadel', this duality
might at any moment become important&mdash;especially to the
non-combatant population of Lepanto.</p>
<p>It was not long after the seizure of Patras by Zavellas that
Franklin's minor difficulties began. The critical position of its
civil population, especially the women and children, and the
rough measures taken by the commander of the irregulars for their
embarkation and expulsion, caused him much anxiety. But a more
serious complication arose some weeks later, when, in response to
a communication received from the Governor of Missolonghi,
Franklin intercepted and seized a Greek pirate vessel which had
recently committed depredations at that port, and detained its
captain, a man named Chrysanthos Morartachis, on board the
Rainbow. The pirate, it seems, was an adherent of Zavellas, who
had the impudence to demand his release. To this application but
one answer of course could be returned. After refusing in duly
decided terms to listen to it, Franklin and Dupont, in a joint
letter to Zavellas, went on to remark that since the principal
object of their being sent to this place was to prevent all kinds
of disorder and robbery by sea, he could not be surprised at
their employing all means in their power to arrive at that
object:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>But (they significantly continue) we also assure you
that we will seize upon all boats under your orders, which under
pretext of serving you employ their forces in robbing and
pillaging merchant vessels of any nation whatever. If, on account
of our not being able to release to you the pirates we have
taken, you do not think yourself able to answer for the accidents
and insults which may occur under the head of reprisals, we also,
sir, cannot answer for the calamities which may befall this town,
the whole responsibility of which will be placed upon you; for be
assured that the least insult offered to the flags or subjects of
our respective Powers will be at once resented with all our
force, and with so much more reason as we have right on our
side.</blockquote>
<p>This resolute language had apparently its desired effect.
Zavellas made no further attempt to obtain the release of the
pirates, who were in due course handed over to the Government at
Missolonghi.</p>
<p>A little later, however, Franklin was even more nearly 'coming
to blows', as he put it in a subsequent despatch, with the master
of Patras. A Greek Government schooner was passing or approaching
the port when Zavellas, without notice to the allied vessels or
to any merchant ships in the neighbourhood, opened fire upon her
from the guns of the citadel. None of the shots took effect, but
instant preparations had of course to be made against the
contingency of one of the ships of the Allies being struck. The
crew of the Rainbow were signalled to their quarters in
readiness, in that event, to return the fire; and 'though I
should have deeply regretted the consequences to others', wrote
Franklin privately to Sir Henry Hotham, 'if we had been forced to
the measure, I yet think a broadside or two would have been a
just punishment to him and his soldiers for their insolence in
firing upon a Greek Government schooner that was close to two of
the ships without informing the captains of the Alliance of their
intention. The only apparent reason of this dishonourable action
was that the commander of the schooner preferred to consult with
the Allies before he gave an answer whether or not he would go on
shore to communicate with Zavellas.' Franklin, however, adds his
suspicion that Zavellas was glad of some such opportunity to
employ his captains and soldiers. Several of the former, it was
reported, had expressed much disappointment at not receiving any
pay for themselves or their men when they knew that the General
had recently collected money from the villages. 'There is nothing
like the excitement of a battle for putting aside such causes of
irritation.'</p>
<p>But there was a more constant cause of anxiety to the English
and French commanders than even the doings and designs of
Zavellas; and that was the attitude of their Russian colleague.
From the very commencement of their patrol duty before Patras,
Captain Zanetzky's behaviour had been unsatisfactory. His
attitude towards Zavellas and the faction supporting
him&mdash;foremost among whom was the Prince de Wrede, a
Bavarian, who had held the post of military commandant under the
Administrative Commission, but had subsequently struck up an open
alliance with the insurgent general&mdash;was more than
suspicious. His whole conduct, in fact, suggested that, instead
of loyally co-operating with the other two officers of the
Alliance, he was pursuing a purely Russian policy under the
direction of his commander-in-chief at Nauplia, the too notorious
Admiral Ricord. Hence his relations with his colleagues in the
roadstead of Patras became daily more and more strained.</p>
<p>They must have reached a pitch of considerable tension when
such a despatch as the following could be addressed by the
English and French commanders to their Russian
colleague:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Sir,&mdash;Two nights in succession, and at different
hours, the boats of the brig of H.I.M. of Russia under your
command have been seen hovering round their Britannic and French
Majesties' ships. We, the commanders of these ships, beg to be
made acquainted with the meaning of this unusual proceeding,
which we refrain from qualifying with a name till we have
received your explanations. We also wish to be informed why your
boats do not answer when hailed. If it has been your intention to
row guard round this roadstead, we think that you ought to have
informed us in an amicable manner of this desire, as we are in
alliance with you, and are here, like yourself, to maintain good
order. But if the rowing of your boats by night relates to your
own particular protection, why, we ask, do they not confine
themselves to the neighbourhood of your own brig, and not pull
close round our ships, which need no protection of the kind? It
is not our wish, Sir, to prevent your boats rowing about at night
if you think it advisable, but we desire that they should not be
sent into such situations as to present the appearance of
watching our ships, and, above all, we require that their
officers and men should be instructed to answer when hailed.<br>
<br>
You must be well aware that every sentinel has the right to fire
at any person approaching him by night without answering his
challenge, and you must also know very well that no ship of war
permits boats to pass by night within her buoy without being
satisfied with their answer.<br>
<br>
If our sentinels have not already fired upon your boats for
refusing to answer them when hailed, it is because we have
prevented them doing so from pure good feeling towards our
allies, and until we could obtain an explanation from you as to
the very unusual course of proceeding of which we hereby inform
you.<br>
<br>
        We are, Sir, with consideration,</blockquote>
<p align="right" class="quote">(Signed) <small>JOHN
FRANKLIN</small>, Captain of the Rainbow.<br>
<small>C. DUPONT</small>, Captain of the
Corn&eacute;lie.             </p>
<p>The 'concert of Europe' does not seem in a very harmonious
condition when the sentinels of two of the Allied Powers have
been brought so near to firing on the boats of the third. Captain
Zanetzky, of course, explained that it was out of solicitude for
the safety of the Rainbow and the Corn&eacute;lie that his boats
had been sent to row round these vessels.</p>
<p>Some three weeks afterwards we find Franklin compelled to
complain to his superior officer of Zanetzky's refusal to act
with his colleagues in the matter of an application made to them
by the Governor of Missolonghi; and yet a few weeks later the
French and English captains came to something so like a personal
rupture with the Russian that Admirals Sir Henry Hotham and Baron
Hugon * had to seek satisfaction for the wounded susceptibilities
of their officers by means of a formal representation to Admiral
Ricord. Zanetzky had asserted that signals had been seen from the
Russian brig to have been made from the Rainbow, which were
answered from the shore; and he had persisted in the assertion,
after Franklin had given him an assurance that this was not the
case. Upon which, says Franklin, 'I told him that after the
imputation he had made on myself and my officers it was
impossible any private communications could be kept up with
him.'</p>
<p class="foot">[* Of this gallant sailor the Prince de
Joinville, in his recently published Memoirs, relates the
following anecdote: 'At Navarino, where he commanded the Armide,
he came up and lay with true fraternal chivalry between the
Turkish ships and a British frigate that had suffered very much
from their fire, which same service the British corvette Rose
rendered him in return and with equal gallantry towards the close
of the engagement.']</p>
<p>Zanetzky was shortly after this relieved of his command, and
Franklin, in a despatch to Sir Henry Hotham, records his
satisfaction at the approaching departure of an officer 'who has
countenanced the insurgents in every way, and has been the
promoter of dissension in the Alliance from the day of his
anchoring at Patras.' Yet the essential kindliness of his nature
comes out in the little incident which he then records in a
private letter to Sir Henry Hotham, written two days after the
unpleasant interview of which he had given an account in his last
official despatch:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I told Captain Zanetzky that I could not avoid
contrasting September 3, 1828, with that of 1832. On the former
day I had the honour and pleasure of being present at all the
ceremonies and rejoicings at Moscow on the anniversary of the
coronation of the Emperor of Russia, and I dined with the
Governor-General, Prince Galitzin, at the Palace, where were
assembled all the dignitaries of the Church, as well as the
nobles of Moscow and its immediate vicinity. But in 1832, on the
same anniversary, I was not even reminded of the event, nor was
either a British or a French flag displayed on board his brig.
... I further told him that, as I had been honoured on my visit
to Russia by the condescension and kind attention of the late
Empress-Mother, and had been introduced by Her Majesty, in the
absence of the Emperor, to her eldest son and to all the younger
branches of Her Majesty's family, I should have had great
pleasure in paying my congratulation on board his brig on the
last anniversary if he had informed me of the day. Captain
Zanetzky was evidently much affected by these observations, and
immediately replied to me that he had acted on that occasion by
his Admiral's orders. 'I wished to have asked you,' he said, 'but
I could not. In fact, in everything I have done I have implicitly
followed the instructions of my Admiral' After this frank avowal
I could not for any consideration have used another warm
expression in speaking to him. I felt, indeed, that any officer
who is obliged to act under such shameful orders is to be pitied,
though I could not exonerate him from the duplicity he has
practised on almost every occasion of our meeting. But his
duplicity is light compared with that of Admiral Ricord, and I
really shall rejoice if the means be afforded of exposing his
conduct to the world, and shall feel not a little pleasure if any
part of the clue to this exposition has been furnished from the
accounts of his underhand working in this place. The proceedings
of the Russian party in this quarter of Greece have been so
manifestly in favour of the opponents of Government that a child
might have discerned them.</blockquote>
<p>But in no incident in Franklin's service in the Gulf of Patras
is the comedy of the situation or his own remarkable adroitness
in dealing with it so effectively illustrated as in a certain
episode which may be shortly described as the 'affair of the
currants of Vostitza'. Vostitza, situated some score of miles
nearer to the head of the Gulf of Corinth, was, and perhaps is,
extensively interested in currants. The storehouses of its local
merchants, many if not most of them British Ionian subjects, were
generally full to overflowing in the export season with vast
quantities of the fruit awaiting embarkation, and in the autumn
of 1832 there were at least two thousand tons of it ready to be
shipped, and representing a sum of no less than ninety-six
thousand pounds in export duty. Hitherto it would seem that
matters had been amicably arranged between the producers, the
merchants, and the military masters of the town by the simple
process of paying the duties to the Commandant of the Garrison,
General Fotomara, for application to the payment of his troops.
Under this arrangement the soldiers had been entirely fed and a
portion of their pay provided for them ever since the revolt of
Zavellas. Where the Provisional Government 'came in' does not
appear, but inasmuch as they were practically powerless to
protect their nominal subjects or the foreign merchants trading
in the town, they had perhaps no right to come in at all.
Fotomara and his soldiers represented law and order in Vostitza,
or so much of these blessings as its inhabitants enjoyed, and in
return for the revenues appropriated to them they did at least
prevent the citizens from being plundered by anybody else.</p>
<p>This happy state of affairs, however, was now threatened with
disturbance from two causes&mdash;the appearance, namely, of two
other claimants to the currant duties. One of these was a
commander of irregulars of the name of Hadji Pietro; the other
was the Provisional Government. The latter sent an emissary
commissioned&mdash;or reputedly commissioned, for he could
apparently produce no credentials&mdash;to receive the duties on
behalf of the Minister of Finance; the former proposed to himself
the simpler method of marching his troops into the town and
crying 'halves' with the soldiers of the garrison. The situation,
therefore, had become critical alike for the proprietors, for the
merchants, and for Fotomara; the commandant foreseeing a distinct
probability of being deprived of his soldier's pay, and the
proprietors and merchants contemplating the even more unpleasant
prospect of finding the duties demanded from them twice if not
three times over. In these circumstances a pressing appeal was
made to Franklin to come and 'protect the currant trade', and in
response to it the Rainbow promptly made its appearance off the
port of Vostitza. The applicant most interested in his
intervention was a Mr. Robinson, a British merchant with a large
stock of currants ready for exportation, and the embarrassed
recipient of 'an order purporting to come from the Minister of
Finance', directing that he was to 'retain' on that official's
behalf 'the duties' payable in respect of them.</p>
<p>Before, however, Mr. Robinson's case could be dealt with,
Franklin received a visit on board the Rainbow from the Abbot and
two priests of the convent of Megaspelion, situated in the plain
of Vostitza, outside the town, who begged him to prevent the
soldiers of Hadji Pietro from seizing on some currants belonging
to the convent which were ready for shipping in a fortnight.
Ascertaining that the fruit was in a storehouse some miles away
from the town, and at some distance from the seaside, 'I was
under the necessity of informing these reverend gentlemen that
the duties of the captains of the Alliance were confined to
occurrences afloat, and that, however much we lamented the
probability of the soldiers unjustly seizing upon their currants
or those of any other proprietor, we could not prevent them
without landing a force for that purpose, which we were not
authorised to do. "But," replied the Abbot, "cannot you say they
are yours and that you have bought them?" "Certainly not," I told
him, "if that was not true. Besides," I said, "all officers in
the Navy are forbidden to trade while on active service." I
thought', he gravely adds, 'that such a desire from the Abbot of
a convent did not speak well for the morality of these priests.'
Finding they could not gain Franklin's assistance, 'they begged
to be shown round the ship before they left it.'</p>
<p>Meanwhile Fotomara had taken prompt and decisive action.
Thrusting himself, with all the dashing strategy of Napoleon in
the campaign of 1814, between the two other rival claimants to
the currant duties, he resolved to stave off one of his
competitors by force, and to forestall the other by negotiation.
He despatched a body of troops to hold the passes against Hadji
Pietro, a movement which was successfully executed, and at the
same time called upon the proprietors to advance him the money
required for his soldiers, on the 'security' of duties which had
been already 'attached' by the Minister of Finance. Franklin was
upon this invited by Mr. Robinson to come on shore and
remonstrate, which he consented to do. To continue the narrative
in his own language:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I pointed out to Fotomara the illegality of such a
proceeding, 'because the duties could not be paid to him or to
any other person but the head of the Customs, who alone had the
power of giving a clearance to the vessel that received the
fruit, and that the proprietors must consequently lose all the
money they now were called upon to advance. He contested this
point for a long time, and did not, in fact, relinquish for some
time the hope of persuading me that his order directing the
Custom-house officer to discharge the loans from the proprietor,
as he received the dues from the merchant, would be sufficient. I
told him, however, that his order would be of no value, and that
the taking of money from the proprietors under any such delusive
idea as he cherished would be a robbery. I reminded him that his
soldiers had hitherto borne a good character, and that their
conduct in preserving this province in a state of quietness would
certainly be strongly represented by the primates and proprietors
to the Regency of their King, whose arrival might be looked for
in a fortnight, and that their representations could not fail to
procure for him the countenance and favour of the Regency. I told
him also that the conduct of the soldiers formed a laudable
exception to that of almost every other corps in the Morea, whose
course had been marked with outrage and pillage, and had brought
down on them the hatred of all the peaceable inhabitants and
peasantry; and then asked whether it was not most unwise to put
his character at risk at this time by any act of oppression
towards the proprietors and inhabitants. He seemed to assent to
my observations, though he did not withhold the remark that those
corps had, by the forcible means they had used, got more money
than his. 'Perhaps that might be the case', I replied; 'but you
may be assured a day of retribution for their bad conduct is
near; and besides, if it were not, can the possession of money be
desirable that is wrung from the poor inhabitants in such a
lawless manner?' Fotomara concluded by telling me he would inform
the captain and soldiers of all that I had said, that for his own
part he was persuaded my advice was the best to follow, and that
he thought the soldiers would take the same view of it. And if
they found the proprietors unwilling to advance the money to them
they would not press the matter further, but would wait with
patience to receive the dues. As to any imposition being laid on
the British merchants respecting the duties, he said that was
quite out of the question. I assured him that I would never allow
that to be made, or their warehouses to be touched. I told
Fotomara I should return immediately after the English packet
arrived at Patras. Mr. Robinson thought the conversation would
have a good effect.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Robinson was right. Six or seven weeks later he was able
to report that some two thousand tons of currants had been
shipped from Vostitza, representing dues to the amount of
96,000<i>l</i>. Franklin's ingeniously persuasive methods, as
displayed in this curious negotiation, show clearly enough that
Lady Franklin's playful compliment to her 'smooth-tongued'
husband was not undeserved. The matter was hardly one of
international importance, but it affords perhaps the most
striking example of his diplomatic skill. There is a homely adage
which affirms the impossibility of getting 'butter out of a dog's
mouth', but it was hardly a lesser feat to have rescued so large
a sum of money from an impecunious commandant of Greek soldiery
in the year 1832. The affair of the currants was the indirect
means of bringing Franklin into contact with a young man destined
afterwards to become a somewhat prominent figure, both in society
and in the world of letters. His host's reference to him is worth
quoting, however, for other reasons than that of the interest
attaching to the person upon whom it bears:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I cannot say Mr. Milnes particularly pleased me. He
appeared to me to be one of those young travellers who, from a
hasty passage through Greece, have drawn conclusions which the
longer residents and better informed persons know not to be
correct. These young gentlemen have for the most part come from
the Universities full of the history of ancient Greece, and
therefore strive to make the modern history bend to those
descriptions, and to think we do not understand the Greek
character. His exalted idea of the Greeks of the present day was
much shaken by hearing and seeing what is passing in this
neighbourhood, from whence sprung all the commotion that keeps
the Morea in a state of agitation. I brought him from Vostitza to
Patras in this ship, and then procured him a passage in an
Austrian brig of war to Corfu, so that he tumbled upon his legs.
He spoke of having seen you (Lady Franklin) daily at Athens, and
of spending every evening in the society where you are, though I
did not imagine he was a person after your taste.</blockquote>
<p>Certainly the affair of the currants was calculated to shake
the future Lord Houghton's 'exalted idea' of the Greeks. There
was no flavour of the Homeric age about it, except perhaps in a
certain faint suggestion of Ulysses. But how perennial a type is
that of the academic politician here shown to be! And how well do
we remember, as how much did we suffer, from the same class of
'young gentlemen', in the years 1876-1878!</p>
<p>The rescue of Mr. Robinson's property was the last incident of
any interest in Franklin's two years of patrol-work in the Gulf
of Corinth. Early in the following year, or, to assign its
precise date to so long-looked-for an event, on February 1, 1833,
King Otho landed at Nauplia from the British frigate Madagascar,
in which Franklin's friend, Captain Lyons, had conveyed him from
Brindisi, and Greece was restored to temporary quietude.
Zavellas, whose exactions, Franklin notes, had become heavier for
the last few months, in pursuance perhaps of an 'old-age pension
scheme' of strictly personal application, appears to have
evacuated Patras without resistance; and, shortly after, the
Rainbow was withdrawn from that port. It was not till December
1833 that she returned to England: but, as her period of active
employment in the Mediterranean here ends, this chapter of
Franklin's career may fitly conclude with the following
testimonies to the value of his services, borne by the two
persons best able to appreciate them, Admiral Sir Henry Hotham,
the Commander-in-Chief, and Mr. Crowe, H.M. Consul at Patras. The
Admiral writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>In the concluding operations of the service you have
so long and so ably conducted in the Gulfs of Patras and Lepanto
I have great satisfaction in repeating the approbation which I
have already at different times expressed of your measures in the
interests of Greece and in the maintenance of the honour and
character of the English nation and of H.M.'s Navy on that
station, wherein you have entirely fulfilled my instructions and
anticipated my wishes. I also take this opportunity of commending
the judgment and forbearance which you have exhibited under
circumstances of repeated opposition and provocation. To your
calm and steady conduct may be attributed the preservation of the
town and inhabitants of Patras, the protection of commerce, and
the advancement of the benevolent intentions of the Allied
Sovereigns in favour of the Greek nation.</blockquote>
<p>The Consul's letter, conceived in still warmer terms, was as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>My dear Sir John,&mdash;While I beg leave to offer
you my congratulations upon being at length released from the
anxious and wearisome duty that has detained you before this town
for the last twelve months, I cannot refrain at the same time
from expressing the regret I feel upon my own account in losing
your society and that of your officers, which has so agreeably
relieved a period that would otherwise have been of unmitigated
annoyance and vexation.<br>
<br>
The humane object of your mission is now completely fulfilled.
You have the satisfaction to witness the termination of the
miseries of the inhabitants of this city, and of the misrule and
violence that so long and heavily oppressed them&mdash;violence
restrained from the worst and grossest excesses only by your
presence, and awed into respect by the dignified calm which you
ever preserved under circumstances of great irritation.<br>
<br>
But for your forbearance the city just rising from its ruins had
ceased to exist. You now see tranquillity and order restored to
its homes, and a few days have been sufficient to reanimate the
activity of commerce.<br>
<br>
Patras owes you a deep debt of gratitude, and, I trust, feels the
obligation. For myself, I hope I need not assure you that I can
never forget your unvarying kindness, and I am sensible of the
high value of the friendly and cordial regard which you have
continued to bestow upon me. For weeks together your ship
afforded a home&mdash;a kind home&mdash;to my family, and the
Rainbow will ever be remembered by them with the feelings which
home excites.</blockquote>
<p>She was indeed regarded as something more than a home by
others besides the family of the British Consul. The happiness
and good feeling prevailing on board of her were proverbial on
the Mediterranean station; and the story goes that 'she was
called the Celestial Rainbow', and that 'the I sailors used to
describe her as Franklin's Paradise.' It only remains to add that
her commander, on his return to England, was made a Knight
Commander of the Guelphic Order of Hanover in recognition of his
services in the Gulf of Patras, and that King Otho of Greece
shortly afterwards conferred upon him the Cross of the
newly-founded Greek 'Order of the Redeemer.'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>
<p align="center">LADY FRANKLIN'S TRAVELS<br>
<br>
1831-1833</p>
<p><small>THE</small> years of Sir John Franklin's active service
in the Mediterranean were years of almost equal activity for his
spirited and energetic wife in various other parts of the world.
They were not, indeed, separated throughout the whole of this
period, for they spent the winter of 1831-32 together at Corfu.
But the rest of the time was passed by Lady Franklin mainly in
the East, and the letters which constantly passed between them
during the two or three following years reflect so valuable a
light on their relations with each other, besides abounding on
the wife's side with bright impressions of travel and lively
sketches of character and manners, that no apology is perhaps
required for temporarily interrupting the progress of this
narrative for the purpose of giving extracts from their
correspondence with each other.</p>
<p>Lady Franklin's desire to visit Greece and the East was as
ardent as might be expected in a woman of her exceptional
abilities and strong intellectual curiosity, and it was evidently
somewhat of a disappointment to her that she was unable to
accompany her husband to his first destination in the
Mediterranean. Her husband, however, naturally felt, and she
herself was too sensible not to perceive also, that it was
undesirable, even if no official objection interposed, for the
newly appointed captain to take his wife out with him to the
station at which he was to commence his duties. The winter of
1830 and the first six months of the following year were
accordingly spent by Lady Franklin in London and Cheltenham. It
was an anxious time in England, as is well known, and her
letters, as has already been shown, reflect the then prevalent
apprehensions of an imminent outbreak of European war over the
eternal Eastern Question, as well as the widespread uneasiness
with which the bulk of the educated classes in this country
regarded the agitation for Parliamentary reform. Here and there
it finds expression from Lady Franklin in language at which it is
easier to smile in these days than it was in those. 'Funded
property does not seem', she writes, 'to be thought very secure.
I think I told you that Fanny [her sister], by an express article
in her marriage settlement, is enabled to invest part of her
fortune in the purchase of land or stock in the British Colonies,
thus contemplating a comfortable retreat in case of
revolution.'</p>
<p>Lady Franklin, of course, has much to tell her husband about
the health and progress, bodily and mental, of her little
stepdaughter; and it may be worth while to extract the following
brief passage from one of her letters, for the relief of an
anxiety of which each successive generation of civilised mankind
appears to become the inevitable victim. After referring to a
somewhat serious illness from which the child had just recovered,
Lady Franklin adds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>She is now quite well enough to walk for an hour
every day, and I shall soon return to her books, though I care at
all times but little for these compared with the strengthening of
her health and the cultivation of her feelings. Her learning will
come in due time, and much better late than early. At any rate, I
shall have the comfort of thinking that I have not stultified her
understanding nor cramped either her physical or mental energies,
as seems to be the fashion in the present day, and which makes
physicians (rightly, I fear) say that the next generation will
present more weak and disordered intellects than ever afflicted
mankind before.</blockquote>
<p>Our anxieties in these days about the woman of the future are
of a more varied, and indeed, to some extent, of a mutually
incompatible character, though whether they aggravate or
neutralise each other on this last account it were hard to say.
As matters stand, however, we are divided between the two
apprehensions&mdash;one, that the girl of the present is being
ruined as the woman of the future by mental over-pressure, and
the other that she is being as fatally unfitted for it by
excessive bodily exercise.</p>
<p>The severe and indeed dangerous illness of her step-daughter
of course arrested for a time Lady Franklin's attempts to arrange
for rejoining her husband, but after the child's recovery other
anxieties of another kind arose. 'I am told', she writes, 'that
the Reform Bill is almost forgotten in London in consequence of
overwhelming fears respecting the <i>cholera morbus</i>. It seems
to be the prevailing opinion of the first physicians that it will
visit this country, and you will see from the papers that the
Government have taken some strong measures respecting quarantine
and that a Board of Health is established. The prevailing
complaint now in London is not however the cholera, but an
influenza attacking the chest, accompanied by fever, and the
sickness is sometimes fatal. We are better off here at present,
and I linger to the last moment before venturing to take Eleanor
back to the heated summer atmosphere of this now sickly
city.'</p>
<p>It was to be Lady Franklin's last month in England for several
years. After a few more weeks passed in anxious consultation and
debate with her husband as to routes and methods of transport,
Lady Franklin, accompanied by her father and her friends, the
Kirklands, left Portsmouth on August 7, 1831, in a steam-packet
bound for Cadiz and Gibraltar, whence, after a stay of some weeks
in Spain and a visit to Tetuan, Mr. Griffin, who was of advanced
age, and felt unequal to the fatigue of further travel, returned
to England, the party pursuing their journey to Malta, where Lady
Franklin had promised herself the pleasure of rejoining her
husband. A signal disappointment, however, was in store for her.
The Rainbow was under orders for Corfu, and Malta imposed a
strict quarantine upon vessels coming from Gibraltar, so that the
first meeting between husband and wife after nearly a year's
separation took place under the unsatisfactory conditions thus
described in a letter to her sister:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>We spent forty-eight hours at Malta, sleeping on
board the steamer in order to save the trouble and expense of a
stay at the lazaretto, and accepting the hospitality of our
companions, who had established themselves in its desolate and
spacious halls, for our meals. . . . My first communication with
Sir John was by means of a letter brought me by Commissioner
Briggs, which turned me sick and even continues to do so when I
inhale its peculiarly offensive fumigation. Then he came
alongside with his yellow flag and his yellow-cuffed guardians,
and then I was put into a boat with my yellow flag and guardians
(and to make the livery more complete I put on my yellow scarf
also), and we were both landed on a narrow platform in front of
the lazaretto, and narrowly watched on each side lest we should
approach too near during half an hour's conversation.<br>
<br>
The next day Lieutenant Aplin got permission to take Colonel
Cochrane in his boat to look at Valetta Harbour, and I was landed
on a rock with my guardians, and Sir John came off in a boat with
his, and we had another conversation. They tell me it was two
hours long. However this may be, the fatigue of standing a long
while in the heat (though it was not so <i>very</i> hot), and of
speaking at the top of my voice to make Sir John hear, united
with the blinding effect of the bright water and the dazzling
buildings, so overcame me that I was fit for nothing but my
wretched berth on my return to the ship, and have been fit for
nothing ever since we left Malta, the motion of the ship and the
mosquitos which we brought away from the lazaretto aggravating my
fever.</blockquote>
<p>Corfu, however, was at last reached, and a house taken there,
in which her husband, when not occupied with his duties on board
the Rainbow, resided with her. Here is Lady Franklin's lively
description of her quarters:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>We are now installed in our new dwelling at Mr.
Crawford's, which is in a pleasant situation on the esplanade,
facing the most romantic-looking rock that ever Nature or even
fancy created, crowned by a citadel and lighthouse. We have a
suite of four sitting-rooms in front, partly elegant, partly
comfortable, but more than half shabby, having wretched stained
and cracked walls, so thickly covered with spots of broken
plaster that they look as if the young Crawfords had made it
their business to discharge their arrows at them daily till a
given portion was completed; doors that seem falling off their
hinges, chairs, tables, and sofas of various forms, most of which
are groaning under the weight of all the newspapers, reviews, and
other periodicals, maps and prints which bestrew them, and dirty
open bookcases crammed with books which cannot always be drawn
forth from their homes without bringing a variety of
novel-looking and flourishing insects along with them. A dirty
green baize covers the floor, and here and there a rich little
Persian carpet forms a brilliant spot on the surface. The
character of the whole is shabby elegance and somewhat dirty
(certainly very dusty) comfort. The bedrooms at the back are more
bare and less attractive. We have not yet proved their intrinsic
merits.</blockquote>
<p>The following extract from one of her letters to her sister,
Mrs. Simpkinson, is in the satirical vein which it sometimes
pleased her to adopt. The peculiar traits of character which she
dwells upon in the personage whom she here sketches are already
familiar enough to the world, but his personality still remains
one of vital and enduring interest, and Lady Franklin's remarks
have a right to be quoted as partaking, however slightly, of the
historic quality of their subject:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Young D'Israeli's follies on board the Hermes are of
a piece with his and his companion's conduct here two years ago.
They are quite a by-word at Corfu, the names of D'Israeli, Clay,
and Meredith never being mentioned but to be laughed at. They
apologised for being too late for dinner, because the scenery of
the island did not enable them to think of such things; accepted
with hesitation an invitation to one of the regimental messes,
saying it was a trying thing to dine at a mess; avowed their
utter inability to dine in anything but a large room, and with
Sir Frederick Adam (who lives in what is called the Palace)
behaved as if they thought their host was a very insignificant
person indeed compared with themselves. Mr. Clay wore long
ringlets down his cheeks, and was dressed in a complete suit of
blue lined with velvet, with blue buttons and blue spurs! Being
asked by Sir Frederick what men deserved who drank port wine, he
replied, 'They deserve to be sent to England.'</blockquote>
<p>It is difficult to resist the suspicion suggested by the
foregoing description of 'Mr. Clay's' hair and costume that Lady
Franklin has confused the identity of two of the young men. The
third, Mr. Meredith, came, in the course of the very tour here
spoken of, to a sudden and untimely end, to which reference is
made hereafter.</p>
<p>Lady Franklin was as much charmed as are most of its visitors
with the scenery of the island, especially with its magnificent
olive groves&mdash;'trees as large and varied in their forms as
the timber trees of a deciduous forest,' looking 'as old as the
Creation, and as different from the dapper little olive trees
planted in ranks in the South of France as are the wild Greek and
noble-looking Albanian (whose picturesque and flowing costume is
caught occasionally emerging from their shades) from the sprucely
dressed gentry who display their Sunday coats on the promenades
of that well-dressed nation on a <i>jour de f&ecirc;te</i>!'</p>
<p>But the unquiet England of 1831 was not to be forgotten even
in this Levantine paradise. News of its disturbed condition
reached them there from time to time, and produced its natural
result:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Sir John grows more anti-Radical and aristocratic in
proportion as the people grow wild, and his are the most popular
sentiments on board the Rainbow. The great mass of the society
here being military, it is not to be expected that they either
are very fond of the lawless rule of the mob, and the two
regiments which are about leaving us, the 18th and 51st (to be
replaced by others), feel, I believe, that they have no very
pleasant prospects before them in returning to England at this
moment.</blockquote>
<p>Another of the letters of this date, a letter written by Lady
Franklin to her father, from whom, it may be remembered, she had
parted at Gibraltar, contains the following reference to a
melancholy passage in the early life of the famous statesman whom
the writer had previously criticised with her usual vivacious
freedom in the letter above quoted:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>It was some satisfaction to me to see young D'Israeli
on board, for though you may not be the companions best suited to
each other, yet the sight of a familiar face and the identity of
the scenes you had both recently visited relieve, I thought, the
dulness of separation and departure. I thought young D'Israeli
was looking very ill, and was told at Gibraltar that, though he
assumed occasionally his usual vivacity, he was in fact in
exceedingly depressed spirits, owing to the recent death of his
friend and travelling companion, young Meredith, of whom report
had spoken [as engaged to Miss D'Israeli], and whose marriage
with her, since the difficulty occasioned by the late uncle's
objection, might be supposed likely to take place.</blockquote>
<p>In March 1832 Lady Franklin, having paid a visit to Malta,
obtained a complimentary conveyance thence to Egypt in the
Concord, an American corvette, to whose commander, Captain Perry,
she took a strong liking, amusingly qualified at times by a
certain patriotic jealousy to which the officers' remarks gave
occasional provocation.</p>
<p>From Egypt she writes, giving an interesting account of an
interview with a 'person of some importance in his day', the
famous Mehemet Ali:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>We had this day the good fortune to be introduced to
the Pasha on board the Concord. He was accompanied by Mr. Boghoz
(his first dragoman and Prime Minister), by Suleiman Aga (the
last of the Mamelukes), and several other dignitaries. The yards
were manned, salutes fired, and all the men called to quarters.
The Pasha never receives ladies, unless they disguise themselves
in a man's dress, and the only European lady whom I have heard of
as doing this is the wife of Colonel L., who seems a very
extraordinary person. She is young and handsome, bold and
romantic, and with these qualities has set off alone with only
her janissary and two native servants for Thebes and the
Cataracts. Captain Perry invited me and Mrs. K. to come on board,
having previously informed the Pasha that we were the ladies whom
he had brought out in the ship, so that we might be supposed to
be living there. He seemed embarrassed, notwithstanding, at the
first sight of us, and though advancing towards the cabin, drew
back and turned round. Thinking better of it, however, he desired
to be introduced to us, which being done, we took seats in his
presence, as did also the Captain.</blockquote>
<p>Here is Lady Franklin's word-sketch of this formidable
personage:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Mahomed Ali is a little and rather vulgar-faced man
about 62 years of age, with an extremely quick little eye in
perpetual motion, and a mouth expressive of humour and satire.
Some people think they see in it the cunning and ferocity which
mark the sagacious and bloody murderer of the Mamelukes; and I am
rather of their opinion, though in this it is not the English
residing here who are my partisans, for with one accord they and,
I believe, all the Franks residing here are disposed to palliate
his crimes, and to regard him with admiration and respect, and
something like affection. Interest may have something to do with
this, but cannot account for it altogether. He is certainly a man
beyond his country and his times. His dockyard has risen out of
barren sands within three years, and his ready adoption of every
improvement, as far as the means he has to work with admit, shows
a character of no ordinary stamp. Ibrahim Pasha is thought to be
a worthy successor of him.</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the part of this year's travel from which Lady
Franklin derived the highest pleasure was her tour in the Holy
Land. As everybody, however, who has made it knows; it is not an
unmixed pleasure to the traveller, and so she found. 'I wished
you yesterday at Jericho,' she writes to Mrs. Simpkinson, 'the
first time perhaps that any one has ever wished you there, and
certainly the first time you have ever been wished therewith so
friendly a meaning. But now that I know what it is to be at
Jericho, I will not wish my crudest enemy, if there be such a
person in the world, ever there again.'</p>
<blockquote>It was not, therefore, in order to herd with us under
a filthy shed with our horses and Bedouins, obliged to cling
close under the dwarf-walls of the most wretched of villages in
order to be safe from robbers, devoured by mosquitos, so entirely
lame in one inflamed leg in consequence that I was obliged to be
carried whenever I moved or got up, and suffering much in head
and stomach besides from having been eight hours, on horseback
under a hot and unshaded sun, that I wished you at Jericho. I
should have been contented had you seen us an hour before
daybreak the next morning, mounting our horses to leave, my foot
and leg much relieved by the poultice that had been applied to it
in the night, and my head and stomach relieved by starvation and
the freshness of the morning air.</blockquote>
<p>The extraordinary elasticity, mental and physical, to which
this rapid recovery testifies affords a singular commentary on
Lady Franklin's repudiation, quoted a few pages further on, of
her character for energy of spirit and vigour of body:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I was mounted on my English saddle, with a white
handkerchief on my head over sundry under-caps, the flaps of
which are pinned in general over my face, partly in compliance
with the custom of the country, which hides women's faces from
view, and partly to save my face from the sun. I was attended by
Owen [her maid] mounted astride, and by our faithful Egyptian
servant, Achmet, by the guide of the Latin Convent at Jerusalem,
by the Convent janissary, by our own janissary, granted us by
Ibrahim Pasha the younger at the camp at Acre, by three others
sent by the Governor of Jerusalem, and by twelve Bedouin Arabs,
including their chief, three of whom were mounted on horseback
with long spears or lances, and eight on foot&mdash;wild-looking
creatures in striped blankets and coloured handkerchiefs on their
heads, with muskets slung at their backs and swords or scimitars
in their hands.<br>
<br>
You should have seen our mounted guard as we crossed the desert
plain of Jericho towards the Jordan, to which we were advancing,
playing in their wild spirits at the game of war, exciting one
another by wild screams, firing off their muskets and pistols,
balancing and thrusting their lances at full gallop, wheeling,
pursuing, receding, sweeping across our path, yet always with the
nicest care avoiding being in our way. Then you should have seen
the bright sun rise above the mountains of Moab beyond Jordan in
front of us, and in another hour seen us arrive at the river's
bank shaded with trees, and seen me with Owen, conducted by
Achmet (all, as you may suppose, becomingly dressed, and with our
guard keeping a respectful distance), walk into its rapid current
and bathe in the sacred stream, dipping my wrought
mother-of-pearl shells at the same time, and beads and crosses,
and filling my bottles and phials with the water.<br>
<br>
Then you should have followed us again through the desert plain
for about an hour and a half to the Dead Sea, seen me carried out
upon some stones that placed me fully in its transparent waters,
and heard me choke and shudder at the intense nauseousness of the
sip I took, and seen me fill a large can with the detestable
water, for as rash and for much wiser folk than myself to sip and
to analyse.<br>
<br>
It was between ten and eleven o'clock before our jaded beasts
arrived that night at the gate of Jerusalem, which had been left
open for us. This excursion, which was one I had always set my
heart upon, though I doubted my power of accomplishing it, was
rendered much more fatiguing than it might have been by our
exposure to the heat, though this was tempered by such beautiful
mountain breezes that the suffering from it was at the time
infinitely less than you might suppose.</blockquote>
<p>Franklin's correspondence with his wife was, from the nature
of the case and the pressure of his naval duties, of a less
constant character; but his rare opportunities of communicating
with her were always taken advantage of, and it is interesting to
perceive from occasional passages in his letters how unwavering,
amid all the absorbing preoccupations of his naval duties and the
anxious work of diplomacy and maritime police, was his attachment
to his old love of exploration. One may well suspect that for
many an hour of his bodily imprisonment in Levantine waters his
enlarged spirit was ranging the Polar Seas. It was just then a
time well calculated to test the constancy of an Arctic
explorer's passion. Sir John Ross and his nephew had been three
years absent on that voyage in which all but the most sanguine
believed that they had perished, and from which they did not
return till after a fourth winter, like men risen from the dead.
A search expedition was being organised in the autumn of 1832,
and Back, it was said, was to be appointed to take command of it.
'But he has not written to me,' writes Franklin to his wife, 'and
I have not the particulars of it. I am persuaded', he adds, 'from
the letters which passed between the Treasury and Richardson, who
offered to go for half his former pay, that it will be settled on
a most limited and economical scale.'</p>
<blockquote>I shall be delighted to hear of his success, though I
shall not be sanguine of it. He probably may learn where poor
Ross met his fate, for I believe that to be sealed; but I don't
expect him to add much to the discovery of the northern
regions.<br>
<br>
I have written twice to Barrow, expressing my desire to command
any ship or expedition to be despatched to the North Coast of
America, and I am sure he has that friendship for me that he has
borne my wishes in view. The present Government will not, I am
convinced, allow of money being spent on any expedition that
would permit me or any other captain to command. A ship being
sent is quite out of the question in these economical days, and I
much question whether I could bear the fatigue and anxiety of
service by land without doing great injury to my constitution. I
would try, however, if anything were to offer, and, if in
England, should, I hope, be successful in my application. . . . I
think my occupations at Patras may have brought me quite as much
under the notice of the Admiralty and of the Government as the
being employed on discovery. It has been a new field for me, and
one in which I have had to act very much on my own responsibility
in cases of difficulty not unconnected with the law of
nations.</blockquote>
<p>The Admiral's approbation of his conduct, though no immediate
benefit resulted from it, might perhaps tell in his favour at
some future day:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The Admiralty, in their economical rage, are doing
such remarkably odd things, and making so many clippings and
alterations, that either promotion or employment seems to be
hopeless even to persons of great influence. I cannot, therefore,
hope any great exception should be made in my favour, though I
believe (call it vanity, if you please) that Sir Thomas Hardy or
Sir Pulteney Malcolm (who has much to say in the present naval
alterations) would assist my views in case of anything turning up
for which they thought me fitted, providing always, with them as
with other public men, that it did not interfere with any of
their plans for the increase of their own political interests or
those of their immediate friends.</blockquote>
<p>In the autumn of 1832 Lady Franklin was in Greece, and from
Athens in November of that year she made one of the most
interesting and most enterprising excursions of her Greek tour.
It was made in company with a somewhat curious party of
travellers, whose peculiarities, as well as the incidents of
their companionship, she describes with her usual liveliness and
spirit:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>We sailed on the 6th of November from the
Pir&aelig;us in a little Hydriote cutter belonging to a party of
French military officers (one of whom had his wife with him), who
had only on the preceding day, hearing of my wish to get away,
come in a body, and in the most frank, cordial, and persuasive
manner offered me a share of their accommodation, adding that
they were going by Eleusis, Megara, and Corinth, and my only
expense would be a dollar apiece for my party for this digressive
excursion. I also of course added to the stock of provisions,
which, after all, have only just lasted, such in particular was
their enormous consumption of tea, sugar, and rum! Of these three
ingredients, they regularly at breakfast and tea made a great
boiler full, which was handed round and round again in a metal
pot.</blockquote>
<p>This, however, was only one of their somewhat disconcerting
habits; for, continues Lady Franklin:</p>
<blockquote>Kind as was their reception of me, it was impossible
to be blind to their defects. Their noise and boisterousness,
their incessant taking of God's name in vain [Lady Franklin
perhaps attached a rather too serious English significance to the
colloquial '<i>Mon Dieu</i>!' of the Frenchman], their gross and
unblushing infidelity, glorying as they all did in the purest
atheism, went far to counteract their amiable qualities. Of
these, their extreme good-nature, the absence of selfishness in
their dealings with one another, their desire to obtain and their
willingness to communicate knowledge, their unconquerable
vivacity and good-humour in all circumstances, were most
remarkable. They all herded together in a small hold, where
everything was cooked, besides giving up their cabin to us three
females. It had a spacious locker all round, and in the middle of
it we could stand upright and dress without being seen when a
capote was thrown over the ladder-hole. As to all the rest, there
are many reasons why it is pleasanter to travel with Frenchmen
than with Englishmen with only insufficient accommodation, and
such I experienced on this occasion.</blockquote>
<p>Their 'desire to obtain and their willingness to impart
knowledge' was thus amusingly illustrated:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>My French friends had all and each a journal, and it
one of them had nothing to say he begged and borrowed from
another or copied from books. This took up a good portion of
their time, and was the only time when they were at all quiet.
Their journals, which were generally of a quarto or folio size,
were always in their hands whenever they landed, whether on foot
or on horseback; and the first bit of hewn stone they saw, down
it went in the book. Perhaps part of it was buried in the earth,
like a mutilated statue we saw at Eleusis; no matter, they wrote
down its length, breadth, and thickness. 'Voyons!' said they,
'that must be a torso.' They measured their pencils' length
across it and said, 'Write down "The statue was fourteen feet
high."'<br>
<br>
At Eleusis I took on shore Gell's 'Attica',* which, I saw,
contained some account of it. They immediately fell rapaciously
upon my book, and the first hut we came to they made me sit down
in the middle of the room, surrounded by a number of wondering
Palikari, and translate it into French, while they stood around
with their books, copying and revising with much care from my
dictation. Three pages I had to go through in this way; and thus
an hour was spent before we began to look about us, though we
were to return to the ship before we could get any
breakfast.</blockquote>
<p class="poem">[* 'Of Dardan tours let dilettanti tell,<br>
      I leave topography to classic Gell.<br>
              &mdash;Byron, <i>English Bards and Scotch
Reviewers</i>.]</p>
<p>The young lady of the French party, the officer's wife above
referred to, 'also never moved without her paper in one hand and
her pencil in the other'; and here the shrewd Englishwoman lays a
ready finger on a point of characteristic difference between the
French and the English form of <i>mauvaise honte</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>She did not care much about it, but she and her
husband would have been ashamed for her to have neglected it. Her
shame would have been misplaced, but surely the ridicule which
attaches in England, or with some people in England, to be seen
doing that before others which no one is ashamed of doing in
private is scarcely less justifiable.<br>
<br>
The eldest of our party, M. l'lntendant La Cour (a man of about
fifty years of age), was possessed of a good deal of
<i>esprit</i>, and was a poet. He excused himself from going to
Eleusis, because during the night, he said, it being very hot so
that he could not sleep, he had been making some verses on
Salamis, which we had passed the evening before. 'C'est bien peu
de chose, Madame', said he; 'mais, cependant, je crois y avoir
mis quelque verve, et quelque chose de frappant.' 'Therefore,'
added he, 'I will stay on board to put the last stroke to it and
to look after your breakfast. At the Acrocorinthus we all knew
that the classic Pierian spring is by some authors (as Pliny)
supposed to have been here, while others fixed it at
Parnassus.</blockquote>
<p>Asked by M. La Cour for her own opinion on the point Lady
Franklin was humorously equal to the occasion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I said that for us it must certainly be at the
Acrocorinthus, unless he would agree to my proposal to go down
the Gulf of Corinth and visit you at Patras, and in that case,
<i>en passant</i>, 'Je le remettrai', I said, 'au Parnasse.'
'Mais, que c'est charmant, cela!' replied the Intendant; 'c'est
une v&eacute;ritable muse, Madame, qui vous a inspir&eacute;
cette id&eacute;e.' As he understands a little English, I asked
him if he knew the lines&mdash;</blockquote>
<p class="poem">A little learning is a dangerous thing:<br>
Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.</p>
<blockquote>On their being explained to him he was in raptures.
'Oserai-je vous demander, Madame, de me mettre cela en
&eacute;crit?' He should, perhaps, be able to turn it to account
in some happy moment of his own. We came to the Pierian spring,
and the young and clever Dr. Ducis was holding the little wooden
bowl to my mouth while I swallowed a thirsty draught, when he
suddenly exclaimed, with great vehemence, 'Arr&ecirc;tez, donc,
Madame, arr&ecirc;tez!' I looked up somewhat alarmed. 'Bien!'
exclaimed he, looking slyly in my face; 'car nous en avons plus
besoin que vous.' Such are some of the truly French
characteristics of my French friends.</blockquote>
<p>'So you see,' she concludes triumphantly, 'I have been to
Corinth in spite of the robbers and in spite of my disappointment
at not going down the Gulf.'</p>
<p>To the tourist of these luxurious days, who may be apt to
underrate the amount of 'roughing it' for which every traveller
of either sex, robust or delicate, had to be prepared, the
following graphic account of a melancholy experience of Lady
Franklin's may well be commended. Touching at Myconi on her way
to meet her husband at Syra, she found a young Englishman of her
acquaintance whom she had left but ten days before at Candia
lying desperately ill in the lazaretto. He had been reduced, he
said, to this state by 'the villainous conduct of the Turks on
board his vessel', where, although he had bargained for a place
of better class, he had been compelled to sleep on deck exposed
for ten successive nights to most tempestuous weather, with
nothing but his cloak to protect him. The vessel having put into
Myconi to take refuge from the gale, he had had himself put
ashore, but as, according to the despotic regulations of the
Greek Government, no quarantine could be performed and no
<i>pratique</i> obtained except at the islands of Syra and Hydra,
even his present confinement would avail him nothing, but would
have to be followed by another term of seclusion in the former of
those islands, to which he was bound:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>He had engaged (he said) a boat to take him to Syra,
but was not yet able to move. By degrees he seemed to recollect
how strange it was that I should be standing before him in
conversation, and he blessed the circumstances, whatever they
were, that brought me there. I told him I regretted that I could
not stay with him, but if I did so I should probably miss you at
Syra, whither (as he knew) I had returned in order to meet you,
but probably I should do as much good by returning to Syra and
stating his case to our excellent Consul there, and procuring him
as good quarters as could be had at the wretched lazaretto here;
but I advised him not to attempt moving till he was a little
better, which I trusted the medicine I should leave with him
would make him. He eagerly took my medicine, and showed me his
tongue, that I might see how very ill he was; but could not ask
me to feel his pulse, since I should then have put myself in
quarantine with him, for there were witnesses of our actions. He
asked me if I had ever seen so altered a man. I left him a candle
and a few utensils, and strongly recommended him to the care of
the Vice-Consul, as a gentleman well known and highly
respectable, and well able to pay for whatever he wanted, and I
begged the Vice-Consul to procure him a nurse instantly. It went
against my feelings and almost against my conscience to leave him
even thus; but if I stopped I missed you, and it was no use my
stopping unless I shut myself up with him in his single room,
which had only the earth for a floor, and where, if I contracted
his quarantine, I should myself become a person whom no one could
approach. I had but lately come out of the Syra
lazaretto&mdash;that is to say, out of a shed of gaping planks a
foot wide from each other in several places, without a door to
close the entrance, with the wet earth for a floor, swarming with
water-rats, and with the rain coming down upon my bed through the
roof of planks. I had been obliged to have the doctor immediately
on leaving this shameful hole, and had scarce yet recovered from
the effects of it.</blockquote>
<p>At Syra, Lady Franklin immediately sought the assistance of
the British Consul, and a boat was sent to fetch the sick man to
the island. He arrived there some days later, worse than when she
had left him&mdash;too ill, in fact, to be removed from the boat
to a little chapel on the islet rock, which the Consul had kindly
exerted himself to procure for him and thus save him from the
unnameable horrors of the lazaretto.</p>
<blockquote>I was too unwell on the first day after his arrival
to go near him, but Mr. Hill, of Athens, who happened to be here
and saw him, told me that Mr Lyons said I was 'an angel', the
best woman he had ever met in the world. There was he at Myconi,
he said, sick and alone, when all at once I appeared before him
and gave him medicines and comforted him.</blockquote>
<p>'He was thought', interjects Lady Franklin with a touch of her
characteristic irony, 'to be a little light-headed.'</p>
<blockquote>The next day I went alongside his little boat, but he
was dozing in the confined hold, and I did not see him. Two or
three days afterwards, having remarked to Mr. Jedder, the Church
missionary here, that I could get no one to tell me exactly how
Mr. Lyons was, and had been too unwell to go myself, he replied,
'I buried him yesterday!' They had concealed it from me because I
was myself unwell and in low spirits; and thus the poor man died
in the hold of his tiny boat without a familiar face or friend
near him, and only a hired Greek servant to watch his last
moments. Mr. Wilkinson (the Consul) did everything that was
possible, but he was speechless for some time before he died, and
it was useless for him to shut himself up in quarantine in a hole
a few feet in extent with a man dying of malignant fever. I would
have given a great deal, however, to have been near him, so that
he might have been conscious of it in his dying hour. I was the
only human being here whom he could be said to know, and this
reflection, together with the feeling that perhaps had I stayed
with him at Myconi I might have saved his life, has made me feel
the wish of paying the only atoning tribute to his memory, by
having a stone erected at my own expense over the humble grave in
the ground where he lies. It will cost but a trifle, yet I did
not venture to propose it to Mr. Wilkinson without diffidence,
knowing that most common minds would sneer at the romance (to
give it the prettiest name) of such an action.</blockquote>
<p>With this pathetic story, so simply and touchingly related,
these extracts from Lady Franklin's correspondence may fitly
close.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>
<p align="center">UNWELCOME LEISURE<br>
<br>
1834-1836</p>
<p><small>AT</small> the earliest moment after his arrival in
England Franklin, as in duty bound, presented himself at the
Admiralty, where, of course, he was warmly received. He had just
been displaying an exceptional amount of that quality which the
official, and especially the 'permanent' official, mind is wont
to prize more highly in a British officer than any other human
virtue&mdash;the quality of discretion. The First Lord was not on
that occasion visible, but the staff of the department 'welcomed
me', says Franklin, 'most kindly, and each one spoke of the
difficulties of my position at Patras.' An interview, however, of
a far more interesting character, and with an infinitely more
august personage, was awaiting him, and its circumstances must be
related as he relates them in a letter to his wife:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>These preliminary duties performed, I went to
Brighton and wrote to Sir Herbert Taylor that I had come down to
pay my most dutiful respects to His Majesty by leaving my name in
his book. About two hours afterwards I received a note from Sir
Herbert to say that His Majesty would give me an audience at five
the same evening, and that I was to dine at the Pavilion at seven
I was, of course, punctual to the time named, and was with the
King three-quarters of an hour, and most closely questioned as to
the present state of Greece, Turkey, and Syria.<br>
<br>
His principal aim seemed to be to ascertain the state of feeling
towards the Russian interest in each of these parts, and the
means taken to thwart or encourage it. He inquired particularly
about the position and strength of the forts of the Dardanelles,
the public feeling at and about Constantinople and on the coast
of Syria. He asked many questions about the harbours near the
Dardanelles, of their fitness to receive and shelter fleets, of
the distances from one part of the Archipelago to others, about
the present state of Candia, about Ibrahim Pasha, and the opinion
generally entertained in Syria as to being under the Egyptian
Government. And, in fact, it was evident his mind was dwelling on
the prospect of war, which then attracted general attention, but
which was thought improbable. He asked what kind of person the
King of Greece was, and said he sincerely hoped Greece would be
established as an independent kingdom. He spoke of Sir Henry
Hotham, of the intrigues of the Greek Capitani, which he said
there was no doubt were fomented by the Russians; but he stopped
me when I was proceeding to describe the manner of Ricord's
conduct to Sir H. Hotham, and that of his captain to me,
evidently showing that these were subjects he could not enter
upon, though he gave me to understand he had been made acquainted
with them. . . . On his rising and my retiring, the King thanked
me for the information I had given him on several points upon
which he required it, but had not met with any officer able to
give it him so clearly; and he further added: 'This has been an
interesting conversation to me. I shall see you (he further said)
at dinner.'<br>
<br>
I was there punctually at seven, and met a brother-officer (Lord
Byron) as the lord-in-waiting. Sir Peregrine Maitland and Lady
Sarah arrived soon afterwards (the former I had known in Canada),
and in a short time the rest of the visitors appeared, and the
members of the household, among whom there was interchange of
conversation. The Queen entered the room with her attendants at a
quarter after seven, followed by the Princess Augusta. She bowed
to the gentlemen, who stood in line, in passing, and spoke to the
two ladies who were visitors. The King appeared shortly
afterwards. . . Dinner being announced, the King desired the Duke
of Dorset (the chamberlain, I believe) to lead out the Queen, and
he offered his arm to the Princess Augusta. The Austrian Princess
then followed, and the others according to their rank, each
gentleman with a lady as long as any remained. I had none, and
several others were so situated. I got agreeably placed next Lord
Byron, though at the bottom of the table. Opposite me was Miss
Wilson (maid of honour), whom my neighbour teased a good deal in
directing her to look to every part of the table that she might
find out Sir John Franklin, whom she much wished to see and had
heard was at table.<br>
<br>
The table was magnificently served&mdash;all the ornaments of
gold. The King drank wine twice with me in company with my
neighbours. The Queen withdrew at the time other ladies do at
other tables, and the gentlemen in due time after. The Austrian
Princess sat on the Queen's left, and the Duke of Dorset on her
right; the Princess Augusta on the King's right, and Lady Saraa
Maitland on his left. The conversation was free, each with his
neighbour, and the whole party very agreeable. On the King's
rising to join the ladies, the gentlemen followed. He took his
seat at a raised table, where also sat the Queen, the Princess
Augusta, and the Duchess of Gloucester (who did not dine), the
Countess of Mayo, Lady Sarah Maitland, and Lady Byron. The Queen
and Princess were working, and conversation appeared to be lively
among them, the King joining in it. At another table sat the
maids of honour and three of the King's daughters, generally
working; and at other tables gentlemen and ladies played cards.
All were allowed to amuse themselves as they liked. None went to
the royal table unless called, and the only person thus honoured
was the Austrian Princess, who sat by the Queen. . . . The King
did not speak to me in the drawing-room, nor to any other
gentleman. Nor did the Queen speak to me. She looked closely at
me, and I on two occasions caught her looking at me from her
work-table with her spectacles. She is shy, and would perhaps
have spoken if I had been near her. I only observed her speak to
two of the visitors, except the Austrians. The King having at my
audience yesterday asked whether I intended to make any stay in
Brighton, I mentioned my wish to go to town the following day to
see my child, if he had no further commands. He replied that it
was quite proper I should go, and I accordingly left the next
day.</blockquote>
<p>Another interview of some interest, political and personal,
took place a day or two later between Franklin and Sir James
Graham, the First Lord of the Admiralty in Lord Grey's rapidly
expiring Administration. Sir James, he says, 'kept me half an
hour in close conversation, though there were many waiting to see
him', and the nature of the Minister's questions witnesses
clearly enough to the keen anxiety of the official mind and to
the threatening European situation which occasioned it. Franklin
was most minutely interrogated as to Russian influence in Greece,
the condition of Syria, the character of Ibrahim Pasha, and the
opinion entertained of him by the Syrian population; whether, for
instance, being a Mussulman and an acknowledged soldier, Franklin
thought that 'in case of any overthrow of the Sultan by the
Russians as a consequence of any insurrection' the Mahomedans of
Syria would object to rally round Ibrahim if they were encouraged
to do so; to which Franklin discreetly replied that, given that
encouragement and an assurance of protection against the
monopolies and exactions of Mehemet Ali, he thought they would
not object.</p>
<p>He was then questioned, as he had been by William IV., with
regard to the Dardanelles and its defences, the strong and weak
points of the forts, the best means of taking them and of getting
a fleet up the Straits. The Minister was especially searching in
his inquiries as to the supposed state of feeling among the
people generally at Constantinople, and what was likely to be the
effect 'if the Russians were to march down among the mass of
people not military or under the immediate influence of the
Sultan. The Divan and higher classes, he thought, might be, and
probably were, bought over by Russia.' Franklin replied, stating
his impression that the people generally were not inclined to the
Russian occupation, and that they would display this sentiment in
action if warmly encouraged and assured of support.</p>
<p>It is worth remarking, as an illustration of the feeling in
England towards the 'interesting people' in whose affairs
Franklin had been for the last three years immersed, that hardly
a question appears to have been asked him at this interview about
the condition and prospects of the Greeks. What were the probable
designs of the Czar, and what the state of feeling among the
Mahommedan subjects of the Porte, were the sole questions of any
interest to the ministerial mind at that moment. And not to the
ministerial mind alone. On all hands it is the same story&mdash;a
story which Franklin tells his wife not without a touch of mild
disappointment in this same letter. We have seen already that he
was no fanatical Philhellene, but it is evident that even he
could have wished for a little more sympathy with the Hellenic
cause than he found:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>You have been prepared to expect that Greece and its
affairs occupy a very small portion of the public thought in
England. The feeling is that of absolute indifference. The King,
Sir James Graham, and Mr. Backhouse, the Under-Secretary of
State, are the only persons who have spoken a word to me about
them, and their conversation related to the political bearing of
the subject with reference to Russia and to my transactions at
Patras, which I may here mention seem to have attracted great
attention. Though I thoroughly detest the modern Greeks, and
would not for any consideration live among them, except from
necessity, I take an interest in the welfare of Greece, and shall
continue to do so, and therefore do not relish this indifference
towards them.</blockquote>
<p>An interest in the welfare of a country is, of course, not
quite consistent with a thorough detestation of its inhabitants,
but Franklin evidently meant no more than we all mean when we
pronounce these sweeping judgments upon whole communities of men.
They never amount to more than a hasty generalisation from
certain conspicuous specimens of the nation condemned, and, on
reflection, are usually felt, even by those who pronounce them,
to be not wholly just. They are not perhaps wholly unjust,
inasmuch as the offensiveness of the aforesaid 'prominent
citizens' is usually due to characteristics common to the entire
nation. The injustice consists in treating the exceptional
exaggeration of these qualities as if it were no less common than
the qualities themselves. Franklin, of course, knew well that
behind the horde of greedy, lawless, and lying Greek adventurers
with whom he had come principally in contact there was to be
found, as there is in most countries, a community of honest,
quiet, industrious, unsophisticated cultivators and traders, with
all the virtues that the adventurer had 'shed' and with the vices
which he had developed still dormant in the germ. These and not
their unworthy leaders were the real people whom Franklin had
been endeavouring to help, and it was their 'welfare' he was
really thinking of.</p>
<p>Thus he concludes his account of his interview with Sir James
Graham:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Before I left him I said I hoped he would allow me to
take this opportunity of representing to him that I was extremely
anxious to be actively employed; that during a professional life
of thirty-four years I had scarcely been out of active
employment, and therefore could not look upon the prospect of
inactivity with any complacency. I was quite ready for any
service. I knew (I continued) that there were many applicants
with equally strong claims, yet I thought it due to my
professional character to urge mine, on which alone I had to
depend. Sir James answered that he feared he could not meet my
wishes at present; 'but if there was any stir,' he added, 'the
case would be different. I should then, perhaps, be able to call
for your services. I am well acquainted with your merits, and
have received the strongest testimonials respecting your judgment
and talents from Sir H. Hotham and Sir Pulteney Malcolm, and
particularly in transacting the difficult affairs of Patras, and,
believe me, I shall bear them in mind, and be happy to employ you
when I can.'</blockquote>
<p>To a First Lord overwhelmed with applications such urgency on
the part of an officer who seemed to think that to have been
scarcely out of active employment for thirty-four years was a
reason for seeking, not repose, but renewed occupation, may well
have seemed a little embarrassing if not unreasonable. But
Franklin had no notion of allowing any such considerations to
abate his insatiable thirst fox work. His pertinacity, indeed, in
hunting up the authorities seems almost to have astonished
himself. For he continues, in his delightfully simple
fashion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>On reading all these details, you will fancy, my
dearest, that your shy, timid husband must have gathered some
brass on his way home, or you will be at a loss to account for
his extraordinary courage. What will you say on learning that I
have done all but the truly official part, principally because I
knew you would have wished me to do so if you had been present,
and therefore for your sake?</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile Lady Franklin was still on her travels. About the
time of his arrival in England she wrote to him from Alexandria,
which she was about to quit in a few days' time for a trip up the
Nile. There had been talk of her husband's joining her, but with
her usual good sense and solicitude for his professional
interests she declined to entertain a proposal which it is
evident had been made mainly for her gratification. On January 8
she writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>It will be a good and sufficient reason why you
should not come here (and that applies equally to your coming to
Napoli or anywhere else), that by being at home you may be in the
way of other employment. There are some signs of a stir in the
times&mdash;signs of war, and much talk, I am told, of various
scientific expeditions. I should be sorry you were out of the way
of profiting by any of these opportunities, and if you stayed at
home on this account I would instantly, on my return from the
Nile, embark on a ship straight for England. . . . It would be
equally unjust if you thought it was indifferent to me to part
from you or otherwise than exceedingly painful; but your credit
and reputation are dearer to me than the selfish enjoyment of
your society. Nor indeed can I properly enjoy your society if you
are living in inactivity when you might be in active
employ.</blockquote>
<p>Then, reverting to a subject which was never long absent from
Franklin's mind, and which his wife had trained herself to
discuss with him in his own spirit, she continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>With respect to the expeditions, I regard them as
affording a means of distinguishing yourself in your own peculiar
line, which no command of a ship on any station in these times
can by any probability present. The character and position you
possess in society, and the interest&mdash;I may say
celebrity&mdash;attached to your name, belong to the expeditions,
and would never have been acquired by the career you have run,
however fair and creditable, in the ordinary line of your
profession. I am unable to judge, however, how far you feel equal
to your former exertions, setting aside accidental sufferings,
which, it is to be hoped, never need occur again. I would not
have you go, to be like; and God forbid you should go to the ruin
of your health, if you should feel to be unequal to any of your
former exertions. A <i>ship</i> expedition, however, does not
seem liable to the objection, and a freezing climate seems to
have a wonderful power in bracing your nerves and making you
stronger. Mr. Thurburn tells me that an expedition is
contemplated to the south, and that a north-west passage is still
thought a feasible object. Now, young Ross cannot do both these
at the same time, and if both are undertaken some one will step
in to do the one while he undertakes the other. They tell me
Parry is on his way home, and he will be working hard for the
vacancy, or perhaps Richardson. I wish him well, and young Ross
also. They are both fine fellows, and I grudge them nothing of
their well-earned fame. But if yours is still dearer to me, even
they could forgive me. . . I hope what I say will not displease
you, and you must not think I undervalue your military career. I
feel it is not that, but the other, which has made you what you
are.<br>
<br>
There are some of your friends who regret that you ever swerved
from discovery to the beaten way of the majority of your
profession. Is not Captain Beaufort of this opinion? I am not,
however. You did not ask for a ship in the Mediterranean till you
had again proposed yourself for another expedition, but it was
not thought worth while. Now it is revived again. Have you
thought of talking or consulting with Captain Beaufort on the
subject?</blockquote>
<p>The trip up the Nile was to be unavoidably delayed for some
weeks, and in the meantime Lady Franklin continued her stay in
Alexandria, sharpening her critical wits on the official and
other native society in which she moved. She saw much of the
<i>entourage</i> of the masterful Pasha, her description of whom
has been quoted above. It was at the time of the troubles in
Candia, when the defection of Osman, a trusted servant of Mehemet
Ali's, was the theme of general conversation&mdash;'a crime',
writes Lady Franklin in her emphatic way, 'of the blackest dye,
because he had been raised from nothing by the Pasha, and
educated in Europe by him, loaded with riches and favours, and
was in his confidence.' His sudden desertion, coupled with the
wanton barbarities he had recently been committing in Greece
(where he put to death some thirty people in the different towns
and villages after they had at his summons dispersed quietly to
their homes), excited the suspicion which the friends of Mehemet
AH would have been glad to see confirmed, that these acts of
cruelty had been committed without the sanction of the Viceroy.
'I am sorry to say, however', adds Lady Franklin, 'that Mehemet
Ali does not disavow those executions, and thus deserves to draw
down on himself the bitter consequences of such cold-blooded
tyranny. I heartily wish that Candia may be wrenched from his
grasp, for if it is not, and he deals with the poor Greeks in
this manner, the island will soon be depopulated.'</p>
<p>Franklin's hopes of speedy employment, in so far at least as
they were founded on the contingency of what Sir James Graham
called a 'stir', were but shortlived. Before the end of February
we find him writing to Lady Franklin that the 'hostile
appearances' which were prevalent at the time of his audience of
the King and interview with the First Lord of the Admiralty 'have
been since removed', though there is just a chance, he seems to
think, that the thawing of the Baltic may again restore the
warlike aspect of things by encouraging Russia to 'hold a higher
tone than she has thought it prudent to do while her fleets were
blocked in by ice.' On this account he does not think it
advisable to ask the Admiralty for any prolonged leave of
absence, which he would have to do if he were to accompany Lady
Franklin on to Syria and Greece, and to return by the Continent
overland. Moreover, he evidently could not abandon the hope,
which has L beguiled so many another deserving officer, that his
deserts had attracted the special notice of his official
superiors. 'Sir James Graham at the Drawing Room the other day
showed me a marked attention by leaving his wife's side to come
forward and shake me by the hand, which I did not observe him to
do to any other captain, though there were numbers around me.'
And he goes on to relate how the Secretary had paid him a similar
compliment, and introduced him to his daughters. 'These,' he
adds, 'I admit, are in themselves trifles, though they show that
I at least am not undeserving of being noticed in such a public
place.' A more substantial recognition, and one which gave
greater pleasure to his kindly heart, was the promotion by the
Admiralty of two warrant officers at his request, and the
provision of new berths for 'all the young mids of the Rainbow,
mainly on account of the credit the ship had attained'. Their
Lordships, moreover, 'had expressly appointed Kay (his first
wife's nephew) to the Edinburgh in lieu of a candidate of
stronger official interests, on my directing their attention to
his merits and pointing out by letter the distinguished manner in
which he had passed his examination.'</p>
<p>Having received all these proofs of the attention of the
Admiralty to his professional claims, and having fully made known
to them his earnest wish to be employed, it would surely be
unwise of him, Franklin writes, to ask for a lengthened leave of
absence, the very request for which might almost be taken to
imply a change in his wishes with respect to active employment.
At the same time, he did not himself regard the prospects of
active service, at any rate of the kind which he preferred to any
other, as hopefully as his wife. She had, he thought, been
misinformed as to the probability of another expedition being
sent to the North-west. 'The younger Ross', he writes, 'has
received an official reply from the Admiralty, saying that their
Lordships had no intention of sending another expedition at
present.' Nor had he ever heard the slightest hint of a South
Polar expedition, of which he felt sure he should have been
informed through Captain Beaufort if anything of the kind had
been in contemplation. 'We may rest assured', he adds, with, as
the event showed, an undue confidence in the possibility of
forecasting the operations of the official mind, 'that there will
be no more land journey after Back's return.'</p>
<blockquote>You are quite right in thinking a cold climate would
suit me. It always has done, and I would rejoice in being sent on
some service to such a climate, but not to go for the mere desire
of travelling, and still less for the mere empty shadow of
increasing my fame. I know that my character has been appreciated
by the officers of my profession, and others higher in station,
whose good opinion I am proud to have obtained, and you may rely
upon it that they do not fancy me to be so overcome with the love
of repose as not to be ready and most willing to obey any call
for my services, to whatever part of the world they may lead
me.</blockquote>
<p>Lady Franklin had in one of her former letters referred to a
Foreign Enlistment Bill then under consideration in Parliament,
the result of which, if passed, would be, she seemed to think, to
enable Franklin, if all prospect of employment by the Admiralty
should fail him, to take service temporarily under some foreign
Government. It may be interesting to cite his views, which were
the general professional views of his day, on a question not
perhaps regarded as quite so free from doubt in our own time.
Observing on the fact that Lady Franklin seemed desirous of
directing his attention to that field of activity, he
continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>You will perhaps be surprised to learn that all
officers of rank who take such a step are considered by the heads
of our profession as mere adventurers. . . . I cannot agree with
Mr. Thurburn that, if a man distinguished himself in foreign
service, it would aid him when he returned to his own. I know, on
the contrary, that there is not a single instance of an officer
who has been employed on foreign service of late&mdash;since, in
fact, such service has been solely a money-getting
adventure&mdash;who has returned to his own, or rather who has
been afterwards employed in his own profession; and, therefore,
if ever I were to accept employment in a foreign service, I
should consider the act as putting a finish to all claims beyond
the receipt of my half-pay from my own, and in so doing I should
only be guided by what has happened to all the others. Except
Lord Cochrane and Sartorius and Napier, I know not any person of
the rank of a captain who has been in foreign service. And how
many of junior rank have been compelled to quit foreign service
by the neglect of their petty employers and disgust at the
treatment they have received! Your friend, Captain H., you see,
had no idea of it after he was posted, nor, I will venture to
say, will there be found above one or two in our whole 'Navy
List' who would. I cannot conceive a more humbling position than
to place an officer of acknowledged merit in our service to be
subjected to the whims and caprices of either Egyptian or Turkish
rulers, or the equally unprincipled rule of Dom Pedro's or
Miguel's advisers. The Dutch is the only foreign service that, in
my opinion, a British officer of the rank of a captain could
enter with credit to himself.</blockquote>
<p>The year 1834 was saddened for Franklin by the death of his
last surviving brother, James, who had returned from India in
broken health and had now but a few months to live. He had led an
active and distinguished life in India, and was a conscientious
officer and a man of blameless reputation; but during his closing
days he seems to have become a prey to a religious melancholy
almost as dark and despairing as that of Cowper. John was
unremitting in attendance at his brother's bedside, and in
endeavours, at last, it would seem, successful, to console and
cheer him. He has left many notes of their
conversations&mdash;notes not intended and not fitted for the
public eye, but abounding in evidences of deep fraternal
affection and full of a healthy and manly piety, which is all the
more striking by its painful contrast with the morbid spiritual
condition he was endeavouring to relieve. James Franklin died on
August 31, 1834, leaving one daughter, whom his brother virtually
adopted and who accompanied him abroad on his next official
employment, and remained a member of his household until her
marriage.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1834 Lady Franklin returned from her travels
and took up her residence with her husband at a house in Gower
Street, Bedford Square, where they appear to have stayed some
months. That weary wait for employment which has been the cause
of so much heart-sickness to spirited officers in all piping
times of peace, was still going on. 'You ask me', he writes to
Miss Franklin, whose affectionate sisterly anxieties as to his
prospects had been accompanied by inquiries after political news,
'how His Majesty and his people get on together.' (It was four
months after that historic coup of William IV., the dismissal of
the Melbourne Ministry by an exercise of the prerogative.)</p>
<blockquote>I think the people generally are much pleased with
the King, though there are several who are not satisfied with his
Ministers [the short-lived First Administration of Sir Robert
Peel]. The Whigs who held the government before have joined with
the Radicals to give every opposition they can to Sir Robert
Peel's Ministry, and they are expected to have a struggle for the
majority on the subject of the Tithes in Ireland. But though the
Ministry may be defeated on that question, it does not follow
that they will go out, and I believe every sincere wisher for the
welfare of the country desires that they may remain in office,
since they are doing great good and have the confidence of the
country generally with them.</blockquote>
<p>Alas for the desires of the sincere well-wishers! The sorely
pressed Ministry were thrice defeated in the course of the next
fortnight on the Tithe question, and at the third defeat
resigned.</p>
<blockquote>You ask, secondly, what my prospects are. At present
I have no employment in view, though I have made application for
it in common with many others. Having been recently afloat, and
there being but few ships in commission, I cannot expect to be
preferred before many other officers of merit. I keep, however,
on the watch for anything that may offer.</blockquote>
<p>Franklin did not, however, consider it necessary to maintain a
watch of such extreme vigilance as would keep him perpetually
within half an hour's walk of the Admiralty. In the course of the
summer of 1835 he indulged himself and his wife with the
distraction of a tour in Ireland. They had excellent
introductions to many notable people both of the social and the
scientific world, and merely as an expedition of pleasure their
visit was a complete success. But Franklin's untiring
intellectual curiosity and thirst for information made it
impossible for him to regard any sojourn in a new country from
the point of view of mere amusement, and his well-filled
notebooks attest the diligence with which he endeavoured to make
himself thoroughly acquainted with the rural and economical
conditions of Irish life. The success with which he applied
himself to this task was soon to receive public proof. Experience
of his past services had, no doubt, satisfied the official mind
that his shrewd observation and sound judgment would make his
opinion worth having on a question of Irish maritime industry,
even after but a brief visit to the country. He was invited to
give evidence before the Royal Commission then engaged on the
Irish Fishery Inquiry, and made several practical recommendations
of considerable value. Like most other students of the
peculiarities of the Irish people, as illustrated in their
industrial habits, he had been equally impressed by the
excellence of the Irishman's natural gifts and by his singularly
ineffective employment of them. The West Coast population
evidently struck him as a race of potentially admirable
fishermen, who, as a matter of fact, did not know how to fish. He
recommended accordingly, as 'politic means of improving the
fisheries', the stationing of 'substantial fishing vessels by
Government on the Western Coast, to be manned with experienced
fishermen and provided with a complete outfit of nets and other
fishing gear, such vessels to be placed on several parts of the
coast, two in company, to instruct the local fishermen in the
best modes of fishing.' The commander and the mate of each of
these ships would be the actual instructor, their crew of pupils
being selected from the boatmen of the adjacent coasts; and
Franklin laid much stress on the point that these instructors
should also be 'experienced seamen', in order that the local
fishermen might be taught to navigate square-rigged vessels into
harbour, thus combining with the fishing industry the avocation
of a scientific pilot. His idea, in fact, was that when the full
benefits of the system of training were realised, every fishing
vessel on the western coast might contain two fishermen capable
of acting as pilots, whereby not a little saving of life and
property might, he thought, be effected, inasmuch as many ships
could then take shelter in western Irish harbours, to which
vessels in distress had hitherto been unable for want of pilotage
to resort.</p>
<p>Franklin, it is hardly necessary to say, was perfectly well
aware that nothing effectual could be done for Ireland, then as
now, without a draft upon the British Treasury, and he did not
suggest the establishment of these model vessels as a substitute
for pecuniary assistance, but as a precaution against that futile
squandering of aids and benevolences furnished at the cost of the
British taxpayer which has been the sole outcome of so much of
our legislative and administrative philanthropy where Irish
industry is concerned. The witness 'does not believe', run the
minutes of evidence, 'that by the presence of the model vessels
fishermen would be enabled to equip themselves properly for the
sea-fishing, but he considers these vessels necessary for guides,
by which any means placed within reach of the fishermen may be
judiciously applied.'</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Events had already shown, and were now to prove even more
decisively, that there was some ground for the apprehension felt
by Franklin as to the possibility of his falling out of the line
of Arctic explorers if he sought other forms of naval employment.
When, however, he accepted his Mediterranean mission, it
certainly did not look as if there were much to be gained by
waiting till it should please the Government to despatch another
expedition to the Polar regions. Arctic exploration was
distinctly at a discount at that moment in the official mind.
With the return of Parry's third and most famous expedition in
1827, when he reached a latitude of 82&deg; 45' and established a
'record' which was not to be beaten for nearly half a
century&mdash;that is to say, not until Sir George Nares's party
outdid it by half a degree in 1875&mdash;the British Government
seemed to think that they had done enough for honour. Parry's
gallant attempt had cost a sum of 9,900<i>l</i>., which, though
far from excessive, considered relatively to the splendid results
achieved by it, was yet quite sufficient to chill the exploratory
ardour of an average Chancellor of the Exchequer. No doubt, too,
the British public, always liable to temporary qualms of
conscience as to the value of adventurous enterprises in terms
either of money or of human life, were not disposed to encourage
any further undertakings of a dangerous and costly kind. After
every great outburst of his maritime spirit John Bull is apt to
fall into the mood of Sindbad and Gulliver, and to vow that he
will never go to sea any more.</p>
<p>It was during one of these periods of reaction that Franklin
had accepted his Mediterranean appointment, and the years which
had elapsed had wrought no change in, at any rate, the attitude
of the Government. On the contrary, it is natural to suppose that
certain memorable incidents of Arctic adventure in 1829-33 may
have done something to confirm them in it. But unfortunately for
British Governments, their involuntary relation to this business
of exploring the desolate parts of the earth is, after all, much
the same as their equally involuntary relation to the no less
characteristically British activity of penetrating its inhabited
but unfriendly regions. They may discountenance exploring raids
upon Nature as earnestly as they discountenance attempts to open
up territory inhabited by savage tribes; but in both cases they
are expected to help the adventurers out of a mess. Thus, when in
1829 Sir Felix Booth fitted out the Victory and sent out Captain
John Ross, accompanied by his afterwards even more famous nephew
James, to seek the North-West Passage, the Government had no
means of foreseeing that, after a voyage most fruitful in
scientific results and resulting in the discovery of the Magnetic
Pole, the gallant vessel would be frozen up for no less than
three solid years in its winter quarters, and that they would be
called upon to send, and would send, an expedition to its
relief.</p>
<p>Yet so it had been. In the year 1833, just at the close of
Franklin's protracted struggle with Greek heroes at Patras, the
British Government had to despatch a party under the command of
Captain Back, with orders to proceed by the Great Fish River to
the northern shore of Arctic America, whence he was to endeavour
to reach Cape Parry, where it was anticipated that intelligence
of the missing expedition might be obtained. For it was known
that Captain Ross in some measure relied for support, in case of
unduly prolonged absence, on the stores that had been landed from
the Fury when that vessel was unfortunately wrecked in 1823. The
Rosses, however, had already been picked up, and were being
brought home by a whaler when the search party reached Arctic
latitudes; and thereupon, in pursuance of his
instructions&mdash;for, to do the Government justice, they seem
to have thought that, whether he succeeded in rescuing the Rosses
or not, he might as well do some exploring while he was on the
spot&mdash;Back proceeded to trace the course of the Great Fish
River, which has since borne his name as an alternative title, to
its mouth. This work was completed on August 16, 1834, when his
expedition reached its most northerly point on King William
Island.</p>
<p>His success did much to rekindle scientific interest in the
survey of the Arctic coast of America, and it is not impossible
that the appetite of the Government itself for Polar discovery
may have come to them, according to the French saying, <i>en
mangeant</i>. It is, at any rate, certain that, at the instance
of the Royal Geographical Society, they consented to attempt the
completion of the survey of the North American coast between Cape
Turnagain, Franklin's furthest eastward from the Coppermine
River, and the point reached by Back from the Great Fish River,
which debouches still further to the east. The connection of
these two points would have completed the exploration of the
American coast-line from Behring Strait to a meridian of
longitude which had been already crossed by Parry travelling
westward at a higher latitude. In other words, it would have
caused the eastward line of exploration from Behring Strait and
the westward line from Baffin's Bay to overlap, and have left
nothing but a gap of some four degrees of latitude to be bridged
over in order to complete the North-West Passage. Considering
that more than half of the sixty odd degrees of longitude that
divide Behring Strait from King William's Island had been
explored by the two parties sent out under Franklin's command in
1819 and 1825, the leader of those expeditions would seem to have
been naturally designated for the duty and the honour of
completing the survey. The claims of Back, however, were at once
too strong and too recent to be overlooked; and Back accordingly
was selected. A not ungenerous envy of his old comrade's good
fortune is, I think, discoverable in Franklin's correspondence of
this period; and his feeling in this matter was possibly
strengthened by the fact that, much as he admired Back's high
courage and adventurous spirit, he does not seem to have formed
an equally favourable estimate of his abilities as an explorer.
It was wholly foreign, however, to his frank and friendly
character to cherish either disappointment with respect to the
leadership of the expedition or misgivings as to its results.
When Back sailed from England in the Terror, that strenuous and
indefatigable challenger of Arctic and Antarctic dangers, he was
sped upon his enterprise by no one with a more cheery enthusiasm
than by the former leader who had sustained and been sustained by
him fifteen years before in their deadly struggle with frost and
famine in the Barren Lands.</p>
<p>It turned out an ill-fated and fruitless expedition. The
Terror left England on June 24, 1836, but was beset by ice in
Hudson's Strait in the following September, and for the next ten
months drifted helplessly in the pack. When at last released she
was found to have sustained such severe injuries that all thought
of further navigation northward had to be abandoned, and her head
was turned homeward.</p>
<p>Thus Back describes his experiences in a letter to Franklin of
the following year, the opening passages of which give pleasant
testimony to the strong attachment subsisting between the two
men. After warmly congratulating Franklin on his success in the
new sphere of duty upon which by that time he had entered, the
writer goes on:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I know that John Barrow informed you of my arrival,
after a most trying time, among the ice, which was so close as to
preclude the possibility of gaining ground. I overtook the Bay
ship in the Strait, and, had it been practicable, would have gone
to the south of Southampton Island; but there was not the
smallest chance, and, therefore, keeping north, our advance was
satisfactory enough until close to Frozen Strait. There the
northern and western ice came down in large floes and packs, the
detached pieces being old and heavy. Finally, we were frozen in
at sea, and for some time were drifted about with the entire body
without much injury; at length we were nipped, and subsequently
the ice came in masses, throwing up pyramids and causing a
devastation scarcely to be imagined, until long rolling waves
from ten to thirty feet produced such confusion and havoc that
the stern-post and twenty feet of the keel were forced over three
and a half feet to port, the eighteen-inch square beams bent,
bulkheads fell down, and lastly the ship was pressed upon the
surface of the ice forward. There she suffered for four months
and eventually got clear from the ice in August, just completing
the year from the day of entering in. Two chain cables were
passed across the ship to keep her together across the Atlantic,
and often she was near sinking. At length she got to Lough
Swilly, and the following day she settled down by the head and
was beached. Being patched up, she was towed round to Chatham and
paid off. . . . This business has shaken me much.</blockquote>
<p>As well it might. But there was good work left not only in the
future Sir George Back, but in the stout ship which had struggled
home with him, staggering under her wounds, across a thousand
leagues of sea. The Terror was refitted and, as all the world
knows, made ready for further exploring service. Two more
journeys was the gallant ship to make to the two opposite poles
of the world before the end of her days; nor till she had seen
the midnight sun shining in mid-winter on the icebergs of a new
continent in the furthest southern waters was she to take her
last voyage northward and leave her tough old bones in the Arctic
pack.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>
<p align="center">A NEW APPOINTMENT<br>
<br>
1836</p>
<p><small>NO</small> doubt it was the feeling of having dropped
out of the line of explorers that lent an additional stimulus to
Franklin's desire for active service in some other form. A year
or a year and a half ashore was always a sufficient spell of the
landsman's life for him. Early in 1836 we find him stirred by the
same longing after some outlet for his restless energies that had
agitated him so often at former periods of his career. In these
quiet times, however, and with his favourite avenue of adventure
closed to him, he no doubt felt it vain to hope for any
opportunity for service afloat, and it was in a spirit of
complete readiness for official employment of any sort that he
now proceeded to address the Government.</p>
<p>His claim to what he sought from them was undoubtedly strong.
Even those who have followed his career thus far in these pages
will perhaps hardly realise how strong it was until they see his
many and varied services brought together in a concise statement,
such as is embodied in the following formal application from him
to the Board of Admiralty:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I entered H.M. service in October 1800 on board the
Polyphemus (64), Captain (now Admiral) Lawford, and was in that
ship in the battle of Copenhagen, 1801. I soon afterwards joined
the Investigator, Captain Flinders, and was employed for the
greater part of the three following years in the survey of the
coast of Australia. On that ship being condemned as unfit for the
further prosecution of that service, I was sent with the officers
and crew into the Porpoise, Lieutenant (now Captain) Fowler, late
the first lieutenant of the Investigator. That ship and another
being wrecked in company on a coral reef on the east coast of New
Holland, their united crews, consisting of ninety-four persons,
had to remain upwards of eight weeks on a desolate bank of coral,
not of greater circuit than a quarter of a mile, subsisting on
the provisions obtained by great exertions from the wreck of the
Porpoise. Captain Flinders returned to Port Jackson, upwards of
six hundred miles, in an open boat, and, having freighted a
merchant vessel, brought her to our relief, and also a schooner,
in which he proceeded to the Isle of France. I accompanied Mr.
Fowler and the crew in the merchant vessel to Canton, where we
were distributed among the different East India ships for a
passage to England. I had the good fortune of having continued
with my commander on board the Earl Camden, Captain Davies, and
was appointed to the charge of the signals on the occasion of the
East India Fleet beating off the squadron of Admiral Linois,
which was lying in wait to intercept the fleet on its homeward
passage.<br>
<br>
On my arrival in England I joined the Bellerophon (74), under the
command of Captain Loring, and was employed in the Channel Fleet,
and, secondly, of Captain Cooke, who was killed in the battle of
Trafalgar, in which action I was entrusted with the responsible
charge of the signal department on board the Bellerophon. In the
year 1807 I joined the Bedford (Captain the late Rear-Admiral
Walker), and in a month afterwards was promoted to be acting
lieutenant of the ship on the occasion of the royal family of
Portugal embarking for the Brazils, whither the Bedford
accompanied them. I was confirmed a lieutenant in February 1808,
and remained in the same ship on the Brazil station upwards of
two and a half years; then on the North Sea station; and had the
honour of being in the Bedford when she formed one of the
squadron under the command of His present Majesty when the Allied
Sovereigns were escorted by H.R.H. the Duke of Clarence to this
country.<br>
<br>
On the conclusion of the war the Bedford was despatched with
other ships of war to convey troops for the attack on New
Orleans, and on the occasion of the capture of the American
gunboats on Lac Borgne I commanded the boats of the Bedford, and
was so fortunate as to be the first person on board one of their
vessels. I received a wound on this service. I was subsequently
employed for nine weeks in the boats and with the army on shore,
and had the gratification of being mentioned in the official
despatches of General Lambert.<br>
<br>
The day the Bedford was put out of commission I was appointed
first lieutenant of the Forth (48), then ready to convey H.R.H.
the Duchesse d'Angoul&ecirc;me to France, and remained in that
ship till she was put out of commission.<br>
<br>
My next appointment was to the command of the Trent, as second to
Captain Buchan, who was sent to attempt the Pole by steering
directly north between Greenland and Spitzbergen, and I
afterwards had the honour of commanding two expeditions by land
to the Polar Sea, which gave me full occupation from 1819 to the
close of 1827. At the close of this service I was honoured by
having a knighthood conferred on me by His late Majesty.<br>
<br>
In 1830 I had the gratification of being appointed to the command
of the Rainbow, and was employed upwards of three years in the
Mediterranean, under the command of Sir Pulteney Malcolm and the
late Sir Henry Hotham, during the whole of which, except about
two months, I had the honour of being entrusted by these
distinguished officers with a detailed command. To one of these
services I may be permitted perhaps more particularly to allude,
on account of the importance attached by Sir H. Hotham to the
careful execution of his orders, and because I know that the
Admiral transmitted the whole of my correspondence connected with
this service to the Admiralty, with repeated testimonies of his
own approbation at my conduct, which documents are now either at
the Admiralty or the Foreign Office. I mean the being stationed
before Patras for eleven months as senior officer of the allied
vessels while the garrison was held by an insurgent force, which
at length I had the happiness of seeing delivered over to the
troops of the King of Greece. This service procured for me the
official approbation of the Admiralty, notified through my
Commander-in-Chief, as well as letters of thanks from the British
Consul and the Agent of Lloyd's, and the honour of the Golden
Cross of the Order of the Redeemer, which was sent me after my
return to England by His Majesty King Otho.</blockquote>
<p>There seems an undesigned touch of the ironical in Franklin's
observation that the official documents recording the
commendations of his superior officers are now 'either at the
Admiralty or the Foreign Office'. Much the same difficulty as
attends the tracing of such testimonies to their departmental
depositary has often before this been experienced in finding the
recognition which it is hoped that these eulogies may insure.
Governments are always officially grateful for services rendered
to the State; but the trouble with many deserving public servants
is to discover the department&mdash;or it may be the
pigeon-hole&mdash;in which that sentiment is kept.</p>
<p>Searches in the present instance seem to have been
successfully instituted, and the ministerial gratitude was
discovered. Indeed, in the spring of 1836 it had already begun to
dawn upon the then Government that a naval officer of high
distinction and proved ability had been for three years condemned
to 'rust unburnished', while the strongest desire of his heart
was, now as ever, to 'shine in use'. The Colonial Office was, it
seems, the first department to open its eyes, and its authorities
then at once proceeded in thoroughly characteristic official
fashion to ascertain what was the most unimportant post that the
aforesaid distinguished officer could be prevailed upon to
accept. Accordingly, the following correspondence passed between
the Colonial Secretary, Lord Glenelg, and Sir John
Franklin:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="right"><small>Colonial Office: March 19,
1836.</small></p>
<blockquote>Dear Sir,&mdash;I request to know if you retain the
inclination which you once expressed to accept of some colonial
office. The Government of Antigua is now vacant, and if it should
suit your views, I should have great pleasure in placing your
name before His Majesty.</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="right">I remain, dear Sir, yours
faithfully,            <br>
<small>GLENELG.</small>   </p>
<p>The reply of Franklin is notable for the homely simplicity
with which he admits obligations to a counsellor whom a false
pride might have prevented too many men in those days from
acknowledging:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>My Lord,&mdash;I cannot sufficiently thank your
Lordship for the very kind manner in which you have noticed the
conversation I had the honour of having with you on the subject
of some colonial appointment, and I feel much flattered and
gratified by the offer your Lordship has been pleased to make me
of the Governorship of Antigua; but, as Lady Franklin is out of
town, I will venture to defer giving my answer for a few days,
till I have had the opportunity of consulting her.</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="center">I have the honour to be</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">Your Lordship's most obedient
servant,            <br>
<small>JOHN FRANKLIN</small>.   </p>
<p>Such a consultation was likely to have but one result. It is
true that the great self-governing British colonies of our own
time had not in those days risen into that importance which now
dwarfs all our colonial possessions by comparison; but even in
the fourth decade of the present century Antigua must have held
quite a third-rate position among the dominions of the Empire.
Nowadays it does not even furnish a governorship to the Official
List. Although the seat of government and residence of the
Governor of the Leeward Islands, it is itself merely one of the
'Presidencies' of that group, and its President holds the office
<i>in commendam</i>, so to speak, with the colonial secretaryship
of the Islands, at an addition of only 50<i>l</i>. a year to his
official salary in the last-mentioned capacity. In 1836 it was
assuredly no great catch for an officer of Franklin's
distinction, as indeed he subsequently pointed out with his usual
sailor-like bluntness to the Colonial Secretary himself.</p>
<p>Lady Franklin was against acceptance of the offer, and all the
official acquaintances whom he consulted on the subject, among
whom was his intimate and valued friend Captain Beaufort, the
well-known Hydrographer to the Admiralty, concurred in her
opinion. It was a lieutenant-governorship not in direct
correspondence with the Colonial Office, and the salary,
1,200<i>l</i>. a year, was inadequate, Franklin was assured by
those well acquainted with Antigua, to the social requirements of
the position. Captain Beaufort, to whom Lady Franklin's letter of
advice was shown by her husband, described it as 'the letter of a
woman of most excellent sense, judgment, and feeling'; and added
that, if he had ever entertained the least doubt as to the
advisability of declining the appointment as soon as he knew that
it was only a lieutenant-governorship, that letter would have
decided him. He recommended his friend at once to call on the
Colonial Secretary and lay before him the considerations which
compelled a refusal of his offer. On this advice Franklin acted
in the characteristic fashion described as follows in a letter to
his wife:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Accordingly, I went to Lord Glenelg (who received me
with much cordiality), and began by saying that the gratitude I
owed him, and the desire I had on every account to accept his
kind offer, had made me take the time for consideration which I
had done, and that it was with regret that the information I had
gained had led me to the decision I should have to convey to him.
I mentioned the inadequacy of the salary for keeping up the
station as I should feel it my duty to do. He said he was aware
of this inadequacy, and expressed his regret at being unable to
improve it. I assured him, however, that this was by no means a
primary consideration with me, and that I was even prepared to
spend a part of my private income in this service (and that, too,
with your consent) if other circumstances had been equally
favourable in the appointment; but that the point upon which my
decision had rested was the not having to communicate with the
Colonial Office directly, and that every official communication
of mine must go through the Governor, which Lord Glenelg admitted
was the case. I had been accustomed, I told him, to holding
positions of responsibility and command, and I mentioned the
duties entrusted to me during my station in the Mediterranean;
and I trusted that he would not consider me presuming in
thinking, as did also many of my brother-officers, that I ought,
in justice to my professional reputation and character, to look
to some more responsible appointment than that of
lieutenant-governor of an island where the chief could by any
means, at any time, in six or eight hours, come in person to
direct the affairs if he chose to do so. This seemed, I said, to
be little more than being first lieutenant of a ship of the
line.</blockquote>
<p>The candour and straightforwardness of this behaviour had a
good effect. 'Depend upon it,' said Captain Beaufort, when
informed of what had passed, 'you have taken a step that will
increase Lord Glenelg's respect and regard for you'; and the
observation was speedily confirmed. Little more than a fortnight
after this interview, Franklin received the offer of the
governorship of Van Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>The terms in which it was conveyed were most flattering, and
the dignity, independence, and amenities of the post gave it so
marked a superiority over that which had been previously offered
him, that Franklin felt he had no choice but to accept it. If
anything could have made him hesitate, it would have been the
doubt whether acceptance would definitely cut him off from naval
employment in the future; and on this point Captain Beaufort
reassured him in convincing if colloquial language. 'As for the
idea', he said, 'that the Admiralty might consider you as put on
the shelf by accepting this appointment, depend upon it that is
"all my eye." You may rely on their being glad to employ you
later if you wished and they have a ship to give.'</p>
<p>The following letter from Dr. Arnold, whose acquaintance
Franklin had made through the Stanleys, the family of the young
officer who had served under him in the Rainbow, deserves
quotation as showing how high an estimate of Franklin had been
formed by men as appreciative of the moral aspects of character
as the famous Head-master of Rugby:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="right"><small>Rugby: May 1,
1836.</small>   </p>
<blockquote>My dear Sir,&mdash;As Mrs. Stanley is going in a day
or two to London, and is likely soon to see you, I avail myself
of the opportunity to offer you my congratulations on your
appointment to the governorship of Van Diemen's Land. I am not so
sure, however, how far this appointment may be a subject of
congratulation to yourself, as I am sure that it is to the
settlement and to the public service; and, feeling as I do the
immense importance of infusing good elements into an infant
society, it is to me a matter of most sincere rejoicing that a
growing settlement like Van Diemen's Land will have the benefit
of your management and character. But I am told that the climate
and the country are agreeable, so that I hope that neither
yourself nor Lady Franklin will dislike your new situation. Mrs.
Arnold unites with me in the kindest remembrances to Lady
Franklin, and in every good wish to you both for your health and
happiness.</blockquote>
<p>And a couple of months later an offer from Franklin to find
some colonial employment for two of Dr. Arnold's sons drew from
him the following letter, valuable not only for its
characteristic expression of the writer's general views of life,
but for the new light which it throws upon his inclinations with
regard to his own future:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The business part of your letter I attended to
immediately by writing at once to say that I should have much
pleasure in receiving your nephew after the Christmas holidays.
... I delight to receive boys of good character and promise, and
yet the pleasure is mingled with a proportion of anxiety; for of
all the painful things connected with my employment nothing is
equal to the grief of seeing a boy come to school innocent and
promising, and tracing the corruption of his character to the
influence of the temptations around him in the very place which
ought to have strengthened and improved it. And yet this does
happen sometimes, though certainly in most cases those who come
to school with a character of positive good are improved and
benefited. It is the neutral and indecisive characters which are
apt to be decided by the temptations of school&mdash;as they
would be, in fact, by any other temptations.<br>
<br>
And now let me thank you most heartily for your truly kind offer
with regard to my boys. I shall be truly thankful to be allowed
to bear it in mind as my younger boys grow up; and if either of
them were disposed to try his fortune in a new settlement, it
would be an unspeakable comfort to me to be able to send him to
Van Diemen's Land while you were Governor, and to recommend him
to your kindness and to Lady Franklin.<br>
<br>
But I sometimes think that if the Government would make me a
bishop or the principal of a college or a school, or both
together, in such a place as Van Diemen's Land, and during your
government, I could be tempted to emigrate with all my family for
good and all. There can be, I think, no more useful, no more
sacred task than assisting in forming the moral and intellectual
character of a new society. It is the surest and best kind of
missionary labour; but our colonial society has been in general
so Jacobinical in the truest sense of the word&mdash;that is,
every man has lived so much to and for himself, and the bonds of
law and religion have been so little acknowledged as the great
sanctions and securities of society&mdash;that one shrinks from
bringing up one's children where they must in all human
probability become lowered, not in rank or fortune, but in what
is infinitely more important&mdash;in the intellectual and moral
and religious standard by which their lives would be guided. . .
. Feeling this, and holding our West Indian Colonies to be one of
the worst stains on the moral history of mankind, a convict
colony seems to me to be even more shocking and more monstrous in
its very conception. I do not know to what extent Van Diemen's
Land is so; but I am sure that no such evil can be done to
mankind as by this sowing with rotten seed and raising up a
nation morally tainted in its very origin. Compared with this,
the bloodiest exterminations ever effected by conquest were
useful and good actions. If they will colonise with convicts, I
am satisfied that the stain should last not only for one whole
life, but for more than one generation; that no convict or
convict's child should ever be a free citizen, and that even in
the third generation the offspring should be excluded from all
offices of honour or authority in the colony. This would be
complained of as unjust and invidious; but I am sure that
distinctions of moral breed are as natural and as just as those
of skin or of arbitrary caste are wrong and mischievous. It is a
law of God's Providence which we cannot alter, that the sins of
the father are really visited upon the child in the corruption of
his breed and in the rendering impossible many of those feelings
which are the greatest security to a child against evil.<br>
<br>
Forgive me for all this, but it really is a happiness to me to
think of you in Van Diemen's Land, where you will be, I know, not
in name, nor in form, but in deed and in spirit, the best and
chief missionary. My wife joins me in kindest, may I venture to
say in most affectionate, good wishes to yourself and Lady
Franklin.</blockquote>
<p>Nothing, perhaps, could better illustrate the peculiar
hardness of the philosophic Radicalism of that day than the views
of this excellent and most kind-hearted man on the subject of the
'convict's stain.' The very same political creed which led some
of those who held it into excesses of mawkish sentimentalism on
questions of penal discipline was capable, in a mind like
Arnold's, of begetting a theory of hereditary contamination which
as regards its shock, both to the reason and the sympathies,
might compare fitly with the strictest caste rules of the Hindoo.
This tendency, however, of his particular school of thought has
perhaps been observed before. To those who have noted it, it will
be of more interest to learn that even in 1836, only six years
from his lamented death, Dr. Arnold could look longingly from his
work at Rugby to a colonial bishopric.</p>
<p>Among the congratulations which poured in upon Franklin on his
appointment to the governorship of Van Diemen's Land was one to
which he attached a value that the people of other countries
would no doubt find some difficulty in understanding. The county
is to the Englishman much what the clan is to the Scotchman, and
the sentiment of 'local patriotism', so to speak, which the one
is capable of inspiring is no inadequate substitute for the
feeling of tribal unity which is the strength of the other. Next
to the approval of his Sovereign and his country, and not so very
far behind it, the typical Englishman of the provinces will
usually rate the applause of his county; and the strength of this
feeling came out quaintly enough in Franklin's acknowledgment of
that traditional compliment, the public dinner given in his
honour by his Lincolnshire brethren. The occasion was in one
respect convenient, for Franklin was at the time staying in the
county for the purpose of being present at the wedding of his
niece, Miss Louisa Selwood, to the Rev. Charles (Tennyson)
Turner, who, he writes, 'is described to me as being very good in
temper and disposition', and whose 'two brothers, the eldest and
the third, Alfred (the poet), dine here to-day, and also the
eldest sister, as being very desirous to make my
acquaintance.'</p>
<p>On June 11 the complimentary dinner came off at Horncastle. 'I
felt very nervous in the forenoon', says Franklin, to whom no
doubt the anticipation of returning thanks was far more
discomposing than the prospect of a battle with an Arctic gale,
'but this passed off before I had to make my speech, which I can
assure you was very favourably received. I had also', he adds,
'to return thanks for you (Lady Franklin) on your health being
drunk, and for Dr. Richardson and Hepburn and Back. Great
enthusiasm was shown. There was a large proportion of clergymen,
with the Archdeacon at their head. The bells were ringing most of
the day. Boys and girls had a holiday, and in the evening there
was a grand display of fireworks. The latter, however,' he
continues with amusing scrupulousness, 'was accidental, that
evening having been previously fixed upon by the exhibitor.'
Spilsby, his native town, had not associated itself with this
tribute, its inhabitants preferring, instead of going to the
dinner, to subscribe for a piece of plate, which was duly
presented to their distinguished fellow-townsman, and by him duly
acknowledged.</p>
<p>The sturdy local patriotism which animated him found
characteristic expression in his reply to the toast of his
health. No one evidently would have more warmly repudiated the
description so repeatedly given of his native county by that
well-known authority, Master Roger Wildrake, of Squattlesea Mere,
as 'the moist county' of Lincoln. 'Some say', exclaimed Franklin,
that 'it is a county of fens; he would tell them to look at its
fertile fields, to view its flocks, its crops of grain, and its
general character; and, even with respect to the fens, what a
mighty triumph had science and industry achieved in their
drainage! Lincolnshire men', he continued, 'were frequently
called web-footed; he had no objection to be called web-footed;
but let him ask them in what county would they find richer fields
or richer crops, landlords more generally residing on their
properties, the tenantry more respectable and intelligent, and
the labourers more comfortable and contented?'</p>
<p>The same note was struck with even more decision by the
speaker to whom it fell to propose the toast of 'Prosperity and
Success to Van Diemen's Land.' There was another quality of the
county besides its fertility, to wit its salubrity. It had to be
shown that it could grow men and women as well as cereals. It had
been said, remarked the Rev. J. B. Smith, that 'because of its
damps and fens Lincolnshire was an unhealthy county&mdash;that it
is a sickly clime wherein health withers and energies decay. In
short, I verily believe in the opinion of some, and those, too,
of rank and education, that to settle in Lincolnshire would be
tantamount to coming to a premature grave.' A glance at the vital
statistics of the county was sufficient, he held, to refute this
groundless aspersion, and the reverend orator then went on to
deal with the still graver charge that the minds as well as the
bodies of Lincolnshire men were apt to undergo deterioration,
that 'our mental energies are blunted and stunted in their growth
here in the foggy B&oelig;otia of England&mdash;that, in point of
fact, we are half a century behind the rest of our country in
intellectual advancement' But how stood the case? With a good
county history before him any one could almost complete the
speech from this familiar outline for himself. 'To whom are we
indebted for the invention of the chronometer? Gentlemen, it was
Lincolnshire Harrison&mdash;Harrison of Barrow. Or again, in the
department of natural history, where shall we look for a more
splendid name than that of the late Sir Joseph Banks, whose
persevering genius won its way to the proud distinction of
President of the Royal Society? He, too, gentlemen, was a native
of the B&oelig;otian clime of Lincolnshire. Or if', continued Mr.
Smith, artfully preparing his climax, 'we look to the department
of astronomy, that noble science, which affords ample scope for
the most enlarged capacity, the most gigantic
intellect&mdash;who, we ask, was the master genius before which
all others bowed and acknowledged the prince of science? Who,
gentlemen, but the immortal Newton&mdash;Newton, whose name will
last as long as the sun and moon endure; and need I say,
gentlemen, that Sir Isaac Newton was a Lincolnshire man?
(Tremendous cheering, lasting some minutes).'</p>
<p>Dry, fertile, healthy above the average of English counties,
and pre-eminent over all of them as the mother of illustrious
sons, such was Lincolnshire by the time the dinner party at
Horncastle broke up, and such, we are glad to think, is the
character which could be as triumphantly vindicated for every
county in England whose inhabitants meet together on any
convivial occasion to sing the praises of their home. Smile as we
may, and indeed must, at some of the more effusive manifestations
of this sentiment, it is one on the prevalence and force of which
we cannot but congratulate ourselves. After all, the debt of
national to local patriotism is not inconsiderable.</p>
<p>A sheaf of friendly communications poured in on the new
Governor of Van Diemen's Land during the months immediately
preceding his departure. One might almost think that everybody of
Franklin's acquaintance, besides a good many who were merely
acquainted with his acquaintances, had a son or a brother or a
nephew to place in the colony, for whom it was desirable to
solicit the good offices of its future administrator. It was
impossible, of course, that he could comply with all the requests
made to him, though his good-nature made him desirous of serving
as many people as he could; and in some few instances, no doubt,
the service was reciprocal.</p>
<p>Such reciprocity Franklin had reason to hope for in the case
of the gentleman who had been recommended to him for the office
of private secretary, and whom, as is shown in his correspondence
with Lady Franklin immediately after his appointment, he took
special pains to secure. But we shall hear more of Captain
Mackonochie later on.</p>
<p>At length the day for their departure came, and in the late
autumn of 1836 the Franklins took their last farewell of their
friends, and set out in the Fairlie for their new home in the
Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Franklin's reputation had preceded him, and there was no doubt
more than the average sincerity in the sentiments which found
expression in the colonial addresses presented to him on his
arrival. Certainly no administration could have commenced to all
appearance under fairer auspices. It remains only to trace the
history of the untoward events by which this hopeful prospect was
so soon to be overcast.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>
<p align="center">TASMANIA<br>
<br>
1836-1842</p>
<p><small>THE</small> island of Tasmania, then and for some years
afterwards known as Van Diemen's Land, was the first of our
separate Australasian colonies to be 'shed' by the parent
settlement of New South Wales. Tasman, its Dutch discoverer,
first sighted it in December 1642, and he it was who encumbered
it with its original name out of compliment to his patron, then
Governor-General of the Dutch possessions in Batavia. Until 1798
it had been regarded as an integral portion of what was then
called New Holland, but in that year Flinders discovered and
sailed through the strait which divides it from the Australian
continent, and named it after his fellow voyager, Dr. Bass. On
September 12, 1803&mdash;during those very six weeks which the
midshipman destined afterwards to be its Governor was spending
with his shipwrecked messmates on the reef&mdash;the first
settlement of the island was made by Lieutenant Bowen, acting
under instructions from Governor King, of New South Wales. Like
all the earlier of our Australasian settlements, it was planted
in the first instance with an eye to the convict rather than to
the colonist, and for two-and-twenty years its administration for
penal and other purposes was conducted from Sydney. In 1825,
however, it was definitely severed from New South Wales, and
erected into a separate colony, Colonel (afterwards the
distinguished Sir George) Arthur being appointed its first
Lieutenant-Governor.</p>
<p>The period of eleven years which elapsed between this
appointment and Franklin's succession was fruitful in the
creation of difficulties for the second occupant of the post. It
was comparatively easy to manage the island as a convict
settlement; to govern it as a home of free settlers, and that,
too, at such a time of national ferment as was the decade
following on the Reform Act of 1832, was altogether another
matter. Between 1825 and 1837 the stir of new ideas,
philanthropic and others, had created a strong and growing
feeling against the punishment of transportation, and the sharp
conflict in which the mother country was destined to be involved
with its Australian Colonies might already have been almost
foreseen.</p>
<p>But the political troubles which were brewing for the new
Lieutenant-Governor were insignificant in comparison with those
of a private nature. Tasmania under the administration of
Franklin's predecessor had become a seething cauldron of personal
animosities and quarrels. It is, of course, an easy matter to
assume in all cases of this kind that the Governor is to blame;
but such an assumption is not to be entertained in the present
instance without special risk of injustice. The experience of his
successor, a man differing widely from him in many important
points of temperament and demeanour, goes far to show that the
fault lay much more with colonial society than its rulers.
Colonel Arthur's manners are said to have been too reserved;
Franklin's were certainly the reverse. The former, if we may
trust a fairly impartial colonial critic, 'avowed hostility to
liberal ideas'. The latter, though a Tory, as we have seen, in
his politics, showed, at any rate at the commencement of his
administration, a distinct leaning towards popular principles of
government. On the whole, it seems eminently probable that even
if the home Government of the day had been fortunate enough to
find a Governor who combined the highest virtues of the Christian
with the profoundest sagacity of the statesman and the most
consummate tact of the man of the world, that paragon would, long
before his official time had expired, have found himself by the
ears with one or more of the cliques into which the hungry,
jealous, self-seeking, and essentially parochial society of
Tasmania, like that of most infant colonies, was divided.</p>
<p>If anything had been wanting to foment the petty passions of
the community and to stir up strife among them, it would have
been found in the rapid rise and progress after the separation of
Tasmania from New South Wales of its local press. When Arthur
arrived to assume the governorship of the colony, Hobart Town,
its capital, boasted but two periodical prints; before he quitted
office their number had risen to over half a dozen, and he had
become embroiled with them all. One knows what the journalistic
style even of the mother country was like in the late twenties
and early thirties; or those who do not know may prepare
startling moments for themselves by consulting a file for that
period of any of the most staid and dignified 'dailies' of the
present time. Add a dash of the colonial vivacity to the
editorial style of the early century, and it may easily be
imagined that the resulting journalism becomes sufficiently
remarkable. The flowers of its rhetoric were harmless enough. 'We
esteem ourselves a beacon (capital letters) placed by Divine
graciousness on the awfully perilous coast of human frailty. We
contemplate ourselves as the winnowers (capital letters) for the
public. We desire to encourage the cloudless flames of rectified
communion, rejecting each effusion, however splendid, of
degenerate curiosity and perverted genius, of misanthrophic
(<i>sic</i>) ascerbity (<i>sic</i>) and calumnious
retrospection.' When, on the other hand, the Tasmanian journalist
wished to pelt an enemy with something harder than flowers, this
was the style: 'I charge Mr. A., late overseer of the Government
farm, with stealing or embezzling a quantity of hay, the property
of the Crown; and one J.B., the overseer of Colonel Arthur's farm
at the Marsh, with receiving the hay. I also charge Mr. X., late
superintendent of the Government garden, with embezzling, and
Captain Y. with receiving, four Norfolk pines, value 20<i>l</i>.,
the property of the Crown. I have another distinct charge against
Captain Y. and one against Captain Z. for stealing or receiving
certain building material, the property of the Crown.'</p>
<p>Thus did Tasmanian journalism treat human vessels wrecked or
alleged to have been wrecked on that 'awfully perilous coast of
human frailty', from which its beacon had failed to warn them.
The specimens are taken from Mr. John West's brightly written and
well-informed 'History of Tasmania', and there is much quiet
humour in the author's explanation of these journalistic
excesses. 'The violence of periodical writings resulted partly',
he says, 'from the paucity of topics, and was mainly a necessity
of trade. The limited field of discussion huddled all disputes
into a squabble. The writers could not forget the names of their
antagonists; they espoused with vehement zeal the trivial
quarrels of this or that functionary. Officers who were dismissed
supplied anecdotes of those left behind which were worked up in
every form. The want of ideas and information would have
withdrawn many writers from the combat had they not possessed
CAPITALS, exclamations (!!!) and dashes (&mdash;), officered by
epithets of horror, as an army of reserve. These attempts to
impart energy to weakness and terror to insignificance gave to
the articles of many old newspapers the aspect of auction bills
rather than political disquisitions.'</p>
<p>Ignorance animated by self-interest and disguised by
typography: such was the prevailing note of Tasmanian journalism
at this period. And for the play of self-interest there was here,
as in all new societies, abundant room. There were few men who
had not still their fortunes to make, or were above competing for
official help to the making of them. Every man might claim or
forfeit benefits that the Government could bestow, and thus there
were multitudes who suffered from those unsatisfied expectations
which so easily assume the shape of personal grievances. A grant
of land desired by one man is given to another; a valuable
convict servant is denied to this applicant and assigned to that.
Here a trader complains that his mercantile tenders are always
rejected, while some commercial rival mysteriously engrosses the
custom of the Crown. There some youthful stranger is invested
with the honour of a justice of the peace, while colonists of
long standing are passed over.</p>
<p>The accusation of favouritism was in those days a constantly
reiterated charge against colonial Governors. Its popularity is
not surprising for the simple reason that it is a charge which
establishes itself. To convict a Governor of appointing none but
friends or dependents to public offices is an easy task to those
who know how to set about it. The accuser has only to point out
that the very fact of any man's appointment by the Governor to a
public office proves him to have been either a dependent or a
friend. The reproach of nepotism is of more limited application;
for even though the dispenser of patronage may not be one of
those 'kinless loons' of Englishmen who provoked the contempt of
the seventeenth-century Scot, yet the number of every man's
relations is necessarily finite. If, however, he is of those who
decline to disqualify an otherwise eligible candidate for office
on the mere ground of consanguinity with himself, he must
certainly be prepared for attack. On neither of these grounds had
the late Governor escaped it. His enemies had accused him of
filling vacant places with his friends; and the undoubted ability
of two officials whom he left behind him on his retirement in
high appointments, was not permitted by his detractors to excuse
the fact that they were his relatives. The attacks upon him
increased in animosity until the news arrived that he was to be
recalled, the Colonial Secretary informing him that the Crown,
having allowed him to retain his office for the unusual period of
twelve years, now intended to name his successor. Upon this the
virulence of his enemies somewhat abated; but the half-hearted
recantations which follow when the object of men's abuse is about
to lay aside all power to help or harm are not worth much. The
retiring Governor was acclaimed by many on his departure, but
signs of hostility mingled with the demonstration; and no one who
knew the state of society in the colony could have doubted that,
had any unforeseen circumstance restored him to his post, the
smouldering ashes of quarrel would have again burst forth into
flame.</p>
<p>Such was the hotbed of dispute in which Sir John Franklin was
about to fix his official abode. His nomination of course was
highly acceptable to the colony; his profession, career, and
character being alike regarded as auspicious. His achievements
and sufferings as an explorer were of course well known to the
colonists; and they could not but have felt it as gratifying to
their local patriotism, as well as carrying with it a touch of
romance, that a man whose name was associated with Australian
discovery, and who was actually in those regions when the first
party left Sydney to colonise their island, should have been
selected for its Governor. His reception accordingly was
enthusiastic. Crowds gathered everywhere to greet him, and on his
entry into Launceston, the second town of the colony in point of
importance, he was escorted by 300 horsemen and seventy
carriages. Complimentary addresses poured in from every district;
and the hearty frankness of the new Governor's replies was
contrasted with the official coldness ascribed to his
predecessor.</p>
<p>Misled by these delusive signs of peace and harmony, Franklin
took a step which, though eminently natural and creditable to his
generosity of character, was destined to sow the seeds of future
trouble. Having sent home, as he felt it his duty to do, a highly
favourable report of the state of the colony and the disposition
of its inhabitants, he received from the Colonial Secretary a
reply expressing satisfaction at such a confirmation of his
estimate of Franklin's predecessor. This despatch Franklin laid
on the table at the next meeting of his Legislative Council, and
drew up a minute of his own expressing his concurrence with Lord
Glenelg's high opinion of Colonel Arthur's services.</p>
<p>That was enough for the Opposition. The late Governor had, as
has been already noted, left two nephews behind him in official
posts. Captain Matthew Forster was chief Police Magistrate, and
Captain Montagu, a man of marked ability and destined to play a
chief part in the embittered conflicts of the future, filled the
still more important office of Colonial Secretary. Even if
Franklin had distrusted them, which for a man of his open and
candid nature was impossible, he would have had no choice but to
accept them as coadjutors. But that, with the two nephews at his
side, he should have pronounced a eulogium on the uncle, was a
circumstance from which no thorough-going opponent of the late
Governor was willing to draw any conclusion but one. It was clear
to an enlightened press that Franklin was about to become, if
indeed he were not already, a mere tool in the hands of the
'Arthur faction.' If any confirmation of this suspicion were
needed, it was surely to be found in the monstrous fact that the
new Governor did not immediately reverse all the acts of his
predecessor. Colonists aggrieved by the late Governor appealed to
his successor for redress, and whenever Franklin discovered that
they had no equitable claim, and that in fact Colonel Arthur's
decision had been just and deserved to be upheld, he actually did
not hesitate to uphold it. What could be clearer proof that the
policy of the uncle survived in the nephews, and that it was to
their insidious influence that the appellant owed the rejection
of his appeal?</p>
<p>But even before these unworthy suspicions had attained to
anything like their subsequent growth, it had already dawned upon
Franklin that Van Diemen's Land was not exactly the spiritual
Agapemone which at a first glance it had appeared.</p>
<p>'In answer', records Mr. West, 'to an address from Richmond
which deplored the absence and invoked the restoration of social
peace, he expressed his anxiety with touching ardour: "With my
whole heart I agree with you. Let us be divided, then, if we
cannot be united, in political sentiments, yet knit together as
friends and neighbours in everything beside. Let us differ where
honest men may differ; and let us agree not in undervaluing the
points of political dissent, but in respecting the motive which
may produce it, in cherishing domestic virtues which will be
found to characterise individuals of every party, and in making
the generous sacrifice of private feelings for the general good,
rather than aggravating the importance of grievances which must
render such forbearance impossible." These sentiments, not less
charming for their amiable spirit than happy in expression, are
important as maxims of political life, and they depict the main
difficulty of the Governor's position.'</p>
<p>They do more; for it may here be added, though it would be
anticipating the course of this narrative to dwell upon the point
at any length, that the wisdom and geniality of these sentiments
on the part of the new Governor only deepen the perplexity which
the untoward course and issue of his six years' administration
can hardly fail to produce in the mind of the impartial student,
and which must always leave its explanation to some extent a
matter of conjecture. The difficulties of the situation have
already been indicated; but one might have thought that, serious
as they were, they could not but be smoothed away or brushed
aside by a hand at once so firm and gentle as that which had now
grasped the reins of colonial administration.</p>
<p>Franklin himself was, at any rate, as full of hope in these
early days of his career as throughout he was full of zeal.
Writing to congratulate Captain Cumby on a naval appointment
which had just been conferred upon him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I am glad (he says) to have my thoughts turned once
more toward ships and the course of my profession, in which my
heart delighteth. I begin, however, to find my present duties
more congenial to my taste than I expected they would have so
soon become, and if it were not that I have to deal with subjects
of such a discordant character, and with persons who have no
common ground of action, and, therefore, each pursuing his
individual interests, there would be much in my duty that would
prove highly agreeable. You will not, perhaps, be surprised that
the management of the convict discipline is not considered by me
as the most unpleasant part of my task, in consequence of it
having been reduced to a system by my predecessor, which, though
not altogether unexceptionable, cannot be easily amended, and
works to the effect of giving security to property and an
appearance of decorum even beyond what you find in most large
towns in our own country. The most irksome part of my task is to
adjust the various claims of settlers respecting the measurement
of their lands, the tracing out of roads through the districts to
the satisfaction of conflicting parties, and the assignment of
prisoners as servants. The revival of old and oft-refused claims
for grants of land is another source of continual application.
The consideration of the very numerous petitions presented by the
wives and families of prisoners for assistance, and of many who
have come hither as emigrants, burdened with families, for
employment and relief, forms part of the daily routine of my
business. When I add to this catalogue that the society here has
been torn by dissension and divided by party spirit, and that the
press is a most licentious one, living on and delighting in
personal scandal, you will be inclined to say with a friend of
mine: 'I don't envy you your berth.' Yet, let me tell you, I am
far from being either unhappy at or discouraged by the prospect
before me. I indulge the hope that, through the blessing of God,
I shall be able to go steadily forward in my duty, cheered by the
prospect of finding the measures I may introduce beneficial to
the colony, and that peace and happiness may follow in their
train. I certainly have the assistance of some able men, who are
the principal officers of the Government, and form the members of
the Executive Council; and I really have found them readily
acquiesce in, and even suggest, measures and improvements
differing entirely from some of those of my predecessor, to whom
they are strongly attached. They are called by some here a
'faction', but I have not had the slightest ground to consider
them so. The Legislative Assembly is to meet in the course of a
few days, and I have then to make my first appearance before that
body, which consists only of fourteen members, all of them
appointed by the Crown. I shall have to propose but few bills to
them at present, as we are in expectation of receiving a new bill
for the government of these colonies which might set aside all we
now do.</blockquote>
<p>Franklin's first 'thorn in the flesh' was his private
secretary, Captain Mackonochie, a gentleman whom he had specially
sought out for the appointment and for whom he entertained a high
regard, but who, unfortunately, suffered from the
malady&mdash;most inconvenient for a man in his peculiar
position&mdash;of 'views' on penal discipline. Before Captain
Mackonochie had held his post for many months, he felt moved to
write a 'private and confidential letter' of criticism on the
existing system, in which, in the most unguarded terms, he spoke
of the law dealt to the convicts in this country as one 'which in
Scotland is called Jedburgh justice, or "hang first and try
afterwards."' The opinion thus expressed, and subsequently used
to spice an article on the subject in one of the colonial
newspapers, was not unnaturally regarded as reflecting on the
whole character of the judicial administration from the Governor
downwards, and particularly disrespectful, reckless, and
unbecoming in the Governor's private secretary, who, <i>ex
officio</i>, is considered to be the organ and echo of his own
sentiments.</p>
<p>Captain Forster, the chief police magistrate, urged that the
letter should be published, a step which would, of course, have
compelled Captain Mackonochie's resignation; but the Governor
objected, on the ground that it would excite the convicts,
irritate the magistrates, and convert the displaced official into
'a hero and martyr of the Radical party'. The situation was,
moreover, domestically complicated by the fact that the private
secretary and his family were inmates of the Franklin household;
and Sir John's reluctance 'to cast them, as it were, on the wide
world without office or home was a feeling,' writes his wife,
'which, when at the height of his utmost indignation, always
calms and softens him.' In the result, Captain Mackonochie's
transgression was overlooked, an act of lenity of which Franklin
had cause to repent, while his escape was attributed to Lady
Franklin's mediation, an impression which she herself had equal
reason to regret.</p>
<p>The incidents, however, which led to the final rupture with
Captain Mackonochie are so closely connected with the question of
penal discipline and of Franklin's policy with respect to it,
that it is desirable to defer the account of them until the time
arrives for treating of that subject as a whole. Another public
question, and one with respect to which Franklin played a most
active and beneficent part in his capacity of Governor, has a
prior claim to be considered. It was a period of awakening
interest in the cause of education, and one of the earliest
projects which engaged the mind of the new Governor was that of
founding a colonial college. Four years earlier his predecessor
had meditated the same undertaking, but the scheme proposed by
him had encountered serious obstacles, and was allowed to drop.
The first step taken by Franklin towards the realisation of his
project was to seek the advice of Dr. Arnold; and the letter
addressed by him to that eminent head-master displays so much
organising ability, as well as such close and acute study of the
social conditions of the colony, that a considerable portion of
it appears to deserve unabridged quotation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The charge (he wrote) which I wish to impose on you
is to select for me a well-qualified person to be head-master or
principal of a public school of the highest class, which we are
preparing to establish in Hobart Town, and which is to be
primarily adapted to the present limited wants of the colony, but
capable of expanding into a more liberal institution when the
developed energies and increased population of the colony shall
demand it. Under the character of a university we contemplate its
conferring at some distant period the privileges of practising in
law and medicine within the colony, if not of qualifying for the
pulpit, considering as the chief motive for this that it would be
a great inducement for parents to give their sons a good and
prolonged education if they could then be enabled to secure for
them its substantial rewards. In its infant state we trust to
succeed in eliciting and cultivating native talent in whatever
stations of life it may be found, and in fitting our growing
inheritors of wealth to spend with credit the fortunes their
parents have amassed, and to become capable of acting an
honourable and patriotic part as magistrates and legislators of
their native or adopted land.</blockquote>
<p>Then follows this comprehensive and informing survey of
Tasmanian society at this stage of its history:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Perhaps I cannot give you a better preliminary guide
to the selection I wish you to be kind enough to make than by
describing briefly the condition of the population. It consists
in all of about 44,000 souls, of whom about one-half are free
immigrants and free native-born youths. On the Queen's late
birthday party, when its (so-deemed) presentable persons were
invited to Government House, from nine hundred to one thousand
cards to as many families or individuals were issued throughout
the island; but this has hitherto been exclusive of the class of
shopkeeper, not a few of whom are wealthy and very respectable.
Many of the settlers or landed proprietors are worth
2,000<i>l</i>. and 3,000<i>l</i>. per annum, some 4,000<i>l</i>.,
and a few from four up to eight and ten thousand. In this free
community (for I leave entirely out of the question that class so
influential in New South Wales, called there by some
'emancipists' and by a late writer 'the felonry') there is a high
degree of intelligence and activity of mind; in individuals much
sterling probity, charity, and virtue; and in religious classes
and self-incorporated societies much zeal for the physical and
spiritual welfare of their neighbours, according to the
particular understanding they may have of the means adapted to
the purpose.</blockquote>
<p>But there is another and less pleasing side to the
picture:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>On the other hand, there exists throughout the
community generally a great lack of neighbourly feeling and a
deplorable deficiency in public spirit. Each man eagerly seeks
his own individual advantage, with little or no reference to his
neighbours, or is always suspected of doing so. An extraordinary
degree of irritability distinguishes the insular temperament, and
all these anti-Christian peculiarities are fostered by a press
which, though in the hands merely of a few well-known
individuals, some of whom are despicable in character and
conduct, exerts a certain degree of vicious power over the public
mind, which nothing but its interference with the privacies of
domestic life, the origin, habits, and peculiarities of
individuals, and the consequent dread of its vengeance or even
its unprovoked malice, can possibly account for.<br>
<br>
Thus a peculiar and elevated character of mind is called for in
the man who, placed at the head of the Department of Education in
this college, will become eminently exposed thereby to public or
rather printed animadversion. He must be possessed of no common
degree of prudence and firmness. With a single eye to the public
good, he must give but little regard to calumny in pursuing it.
Nowhere must a man set public opinion at first so completely at
defiance as in Van Diemen's Land. He must resolve to live down
imputations on his character and conduct, not expecting otherwise
to overcome them. Such a person as this, however, would be
supported and countenanced by the best part of the community,
even though he were in some points open to censure. His office
would be honoured, and his position would be
honourable.</blockquote>
<p>On the 'conscience' question, then as now and ever a burning
one, Franklin writes with that combination of sincere piety and
sound common-sense which one would have expected:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I may add that such an institution as we are
endeavouring to provide for has been in contemplation some years;
the hindrances have been the difficulty of finding a competent
master in this quarter of the globe, and the still greater
difficulty of obtaining any unanimity of opinion upon the
principles on which it should act and the religious doctrines
that should be taught in it. On the last point the utmost
diversity of opinion prevails. The arguments on it are such as
must be familiar to you on either side of the question, and need
not be repeated. I believe, however, that it is the feeling of
the vast majority of the community that the most important of all
knowledge should not be the only knowledge which is set aside as
uncertain or problematical. I, for one, and as the head of the
community, cannot consent that religious instruction should be
excluded, and religion itself thereby, as I conceive,
dishonoured. . . . Though I have not stated that the person
selected should be a clergyman, or even a member of the Church of
England, yet I believe (putting my own predilection on that head
entirely out of the question) that it would be more generally
acceptable that he should be such than otherwise. Nearly
three-fourths of the community are of that persuasion. He should
also, I think, be a member of one of the English universities. On
the subject of the religious instruction to be adopted in the
proposed school, I would only say that, while the instruction
communicated must be founded on a strictly religious basis, and
while it will be the desire of the Government that the
instruction should be as little exclusive as possible, he will
never be called upon to teach or authorise the teaching of any
doctrine which he may show to be repugnant to the tenets of the
Church&mdash;in the present instance that of England&mdash;of
which he was a member.</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Arnold's response to this appeal was most gratifying, and
the mission entrusted to him admirably executed. For the
principal of the contemplated college his choice fell upon the
Rev. J. P. Gell, sometime pupil of his own, who, after a
successful career of seven years both as organiser and teacher,
and, in truth, pioneer of the higher education in the colony,
returned to England to become the husband of Sir John Franklin's
daughter and only child, Eleanor, and, as the venerable Rector of
Buxted, in Sussex, still survives.</p>
<p>It is, however, one thing to choose the principal of a college
with sound professional judgment, and another thing to frame its
charter with administrative wisdom. Dr. Arnold was an eminently
able and justly celebrated preceptor; but as a politician he
belonged to the peculiar school of doctrinaire liberalism then
dominant, and shared its essentially unpractical and unworkable
theories as to the adjustment of competing denominational claims.
It is anticipating matters a little to quote in this place the
letter which follows; but to read it in immediate succession to
the preceding one will, perhaps, give a fuller conception of
Franklin's sturdy common-sense and independence of judgment. High
as was his respect for Arnold's ability in the educational
sphere, he was not in the least overawed by his name and
reputation in criticising Arnold's proposals as an academic
legislator. The Headmaster of Rugby had been requested by Lord
John Russell, who had succeeded to the Colonial Office, to draft
the charter of the new college; and the result had been a scheme
of the most 'enlightened' and unpractical kind, and containing a
fantastic provision for appointing a Principal, 'turn and turn
about', from the Anglican and the Scotch Presbyterian communions.
Besides this, it proposed an exquisite arrangement for securing
what was considered to be the just representation of each of
these two religious bodies on the teaching staff. A more telling
contrast between the methods of the academic legislator and those
of the practical statesman could hardly be found than in
Franklin's blunt, straightforward, not disrespectful, but wholly
destructive criticisms of this notable scheme:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I have need to crave your indulgence if, after having
requested your aid in this matter by suggesting that a reference
should be made to you, I now presume to question any one of the
principles on which you have proceeded in complying with my
request. I cannot but blame myself that, in a case in which I
have such strong convictions, and in which, though I have no
other advantage, I have that of some experience of the state of
this colony, I did not foresee the conclusions to which you might
possibly arrive, and against which I might at least have stated
my objections. I did, however, in a letter to Lord John
Russell&mdash;written, if I recollect rightly, a few months after
requesting a charter&mdash;deprecate the introduction of any
change from the terms on which the first principal was selected,
in case any such liability to change should appear to be involved
in the liberal principles advocated for the foundation. I was not
unmindful of the argument of the Scotch, that in a British colony
they are entitled to an equality of rights; but this argument is
virtually superseded by the fact that in this colony there are
three Established Churches, the Church of Rome being one. In
consistency with this unhappy Act of Sir Richard Bourke's [a
former Governor of New South Wales, by whom this extraordinary
arrangement had been recommended to the Colonial Office], we
ought to have the headship of the college divided between the
three Churches of England, Scotland, and Rome, a mode of
reconciling matters which I need not say would be
self-destruction. It has appeared to me that the only way to
manage this difficulty is to give up the ground of ecclesiastical
establishment altogether (a ground always offensive also to a
large body of Dissenters who belong to no establishment), and to
give the ascendency, if such an invidious word must be used, to
the Church of the majority&mdash;such an ascendency interfering
in nothing with the equal privileges of all the members of the
college to refrain from joining in any religious ceremonies which
they object to, or to observe any religious exercise which they
had the means of attending.</blockquote>
<p>'Denominationalism tempered by the conscience clause' is
familiar enough to us in these days as the governing principle of
the State-aided voluntary school system, and indeed as the only
practical principle on which the competing religious claims of
majorities and minorities can be adjusted in educational matters;
but in the second quarter of the nineteenth century the principle
was by no means so well established as it is to-day, and it is
interesting to note that it is not the schoolmaster-politician
but the sailor-administrator who is the first to arrive at it.
'Would there be any difficulty', Franklin continues, 'in stating
in terms that the Principal should always be a member of the
Church of England as long as that Church is the Church of the
majority&mdash;I mean the majority of the students, not of the
population? It appears to me that it is necessary for the
uniform, steadfast, and independent conduct of the college that
the Principals one after another should be of one Church, and if
of one, it would be most fair that it should be the Church of the
majority.'</p>
<p>Then, passing to the even more pedantic proposal with
reference to the teaching staff, he proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>But if I feel a strong objection to the headship of
the college being first of one Church, then of another, I have
even a still stronger one to the special provision which it is
proposed to make for the keeping up of two religious
denominations within the walls of the college itself, and which,
it appears to me, would be a provision for sectarianism and
faction, the influence of which might embarrass and coerce those
even for whose exclusive benefit it was intended. Might it not be
better [continues Franklin, with undesigned but not the less
searching irony] to make learning and character the sole
qualifications for members of the college, rather than take any
notice of denominational distinctions as qualifications for
instructing the students in religious knowledge? The master and
fellows, or by whatever name they are called, chosen on the
latter principle would, I fear, scarcely fail to regard
themselves as the representatives of their sect, and, like the
members for boroughs in the Imperial Parliament, would feel that
they were bound to advocate beyond all other interests the
interests of their constituents, and to act as the organs of a
party. The Principal would then be driven to act as the
representative of his party, thus losing his dignified and proper
position; while among the students themselves would be engendered
a spirit of clanship and party strife which would be found most
tyrannical where the numerical power existed, and most bitter in
the weaker party.</blockquote>
<p>Franklin then goes on to reinforce his position by an argument
which for us in these days has an almost painful
cogency:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>If at home our mixed nationality is still a source of
jealousy and divided feeling, why should it be cherished at the
uttermost extremity of the globe, in a country, too, where the
present generations, strongly attached as they are to the soil,
are more apt to regard themselves as Tasmanians than anything
else?</blockquote>
<p>Why, in other words, export Particularism from the
mother-country to a colony which has shown no inclination thus
far to manufacture that article for itself? There could be no
sounder or more statesmanlike advice, and it availed. The later
history of the college, however, was not a fortunate one. It
became unhappily entangled in a complication of inter-local and
denominational jealousies; the Imperial Government withdrew its
support, and the scheme fell through. The colony had for the time
to content itself with the establishment of a high school under
the management of Mr. Gell, to the funds of which Franklin made a
donation of 500<i>l</i>. before leaving the island, while Lady
Franklin made the munificent gift of 400 acres of land on which
she had founded a museum, in trust for the benefit of any
collegiate institution that might afterwards be established. But
the failure of the larger educational project was no fault of
Franklin's. His management of the matter throughout was
characterised by admirable good sense, fair-mindedness, and
consideration for others. The responsibility for the defeat of
his excellent intentions certainly does not rest in the smallest
measure on Franklin's shoulders.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>
<p align="center">THE COLONIAL GOVERNOR<br>
<br>
1836-1842</p>
<p><small>IT</small> was not, however, in regard to educational
matters alone, or even chiefly, that the period between 1832 and
1841 was so great a day for the proud possessor of the newest
'views.' We have seen from an above-quoted letter of Franklin's
to his old friend and commander, Captain Cumby, that they were
expecting from the Government a Bill for the future
administration of the Australian Colonies as well as for the
reorganisation of the convict system. In due time the project of
the proposed legislation arrived, and all too faithfully indeed
did it reflect the latest English Liberal ideas, exported 'in
bulk', after the fashion of the reformers of those days, for
wholesale application to a community absolutely unfitted to adopt
them. Thus, the reconstruction of the English municipal
corporations being a triumph still fresh in the minds of Liberal
politicians, nothing would content them short of the assumption
that the materials of local self-government are necessarily and
of the very nature of things to be found in all quarters of the
English Empire, however remote, and among all societies, however
rude. What, then, could be more hopeful, more rich in promise of
future blessings, than to create municipal corporations by a
stroke of the pen in&mdash;among other Australian
settlements&mdash;the island of Tasmania?</p>
<p>Common-sense, however, and practical knowledge ultimately
prevailed. The absurd project was dropped, and no more was heard
of a representative system on the English model until a good many
years later, when these Australasian communities were more fitted
to receive them. But 'the ten-pound householder', who figured as
the electoral unit in this abortive proposal, puts the finishing
touch to it. In England the ten-pound householder, after, so to
speak, undergoing an education in the duties of citizenship
extending over about six centuries, had only within the last six
years been admitted to political power. Tasmania, on the other
hand, had only come into existence as a British settlement some
thirty odd years before, and the political education of a large
portion of its inhabitants had been acquired in that too
elementary school of citizenship to which admission could be
obtained by incurring a sentence of transportation for life or
for a term of years. But the Reformers of the 'Thirties' seem to
have been quite satisfied with the amount of resemblance between
the two communities. Popular suffrage was a good thing; elective
municipal corporations were good things; representative
assemblies, large or small, and as many of them as possible, were
good things&mdash;for England. Therefore they would be equally
good things for a half-fledged colony, with a scattered
population of settlers too busy to govern themselves, and a large
sprinkling of reclaimed or half-reclaimed convicts, only too
anxious for the opportunity of governing other people. As to the
qualification, why, ten pounds was ten pounds all the world over.
One wonders how many similar projects of political theorists at
home have in the course of our history been quietly killed by
that practical good sense and administrative wisdom which have
fortunately been seldom wanting to us in the more remote parts of
our Empire.</p>
<p>The other proposal of the Colonial Office was of a less
speculative and experimental kind, and had reference to a
question on which there was room for legitimate difference of
opinion among men of sound judgment and ripe experience in
colonial affairs. It has been observed already that the
controversies connected with the subject of the transportation
system&mdash;controversies bearing partly upon economical
questions, and partly on the various branches of the difficult
problem of penal discipline&mdash;had been maturing with some
rapidity during the years immediately preceding Franklin's
appointment. In the year 1837 Sir William Molesworth obtained the
appointment of a Select Committee of the House of Commons to
investigate the whole question of transportation and penal
discipline in general. Many witnesses were examined by this body
and a large mass of evidence was accumulated, much of it of
course, as was to be expected in such a case, of a violently
partisan and exaggerated character. Franklin had from the first
been a steady though moderate and fair-minded supporter of the
existing system, and the criticisms of the evidence which were
embodied by him in a letter to Sir Edward Parry, who, on the
strength of his Australian experience, had been examined before
the Committee, and which he afterwards substantially repeated in
a despatch to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, form a
document of high interest and value.</p>
<p>He protested, to begin with, against the unmeasured terms in
which some of the witnesses had decried the discipline exercised
in the colony under his administration. 'It is one', he said, 'of
coercion, certainly; but that coercion is tempered with
compassion and with the most earnest desire for the amendment of
the offenders.' To the assertion that 'the convict is beyond
endurance miserable'&mdash;or, at any rate, to the inference
sought to be drawn from that sweeping proposition&mdash;he
opposed an indignant denial. 'When convicts are in that state of
misery it is attributable, not to the laws and treatment to which
they are exposed, but to their own determined perseverance in a
course of hardened wickedness, and the same man would be in a
similar unhappy condition anywhere.'</p>
<p>But to appreciate the significance of the more important
observations of this document, it will be necessary to take a
brief review of the history of a now almost forgotten incident of
our then system of penal discipline in the Colonies.</p>
<p>Among all the questions incidentally connected with the main
subject of transportation, none perhaps was more keenly debated
than that of 'assignment'&mdash;the practice, that is to say, of
allotting a convict after a certain term of penal discipline to
the service of a master, under conditions varied from time to
time by statutory enactment or administrative regulation. It
existed in our American settlements for a period of more than
fifty years of the eighteenth century, and was introduced in
Tasmania by Governor King in 1804. Under the system then
established the master was bound by indenture to retain the
servant for one year, a penalty of a shilling being imposed upon
him for every day which fell short of that period. The quantity
of work to be done was prescribed&mdash;contingently, however, on
the nature of the soil, the state of the weather, and the
strength of the workman. Wages were fixed at 10<i>l</i>. per
annum for a man and 7<i>l</i>. for a woman. To restrict the habit
of change, a rule was established by a subsequent Governor
(Macquarrie) that no convict should be returnable to the
authorities except for infirmity, sickness, or crime; but when
the supply exceeded the demand the condition was evaded, and the
result, of course, was an accumulation of convicts on the hands
of the Government. Theoretically, the advantages to the colonists
of this virtually unlimited supply of labour appeared
considerable; but in practice this was not the case, for a large
proportion of the convicts, coming from the manufacturing
districts of Great Britain, were utterly ignorant of agriculture
and required a tedious training before they paid the expenses of
their support.</p>
<p>So far, however, as these cases were concerned, the principle
of the system was sound enough. In theory at any rate all three
parties&mdash;the employer, the convict, and the
State&mdash;derived a benefit from the arrangement. The first
obtained labour on moderate, perhaps on exceptionally easy terms
the second regained his freedom and an opportunity, if he wished
to reform, of earning an honest living; the third saved the
present expense of the convict's maintenance and took the best
means of preventing his return upon their hands in future. But in
other directions the system was liable to gross, abuse. Thus it
was the custom to allot to the superior officers, magistrates,
and constables, in proportion to their rank, a certain number of
men who were subsisted from Government stores, the State thus
continuing to defray the keep of men who by the hypothesis were
fit for freedom. For instance, a skilled mechanic assigned on
these terms was, of course, a highly valuable acquisition to his
master, who allowed him to 'hire his own time' at from
5.<i>s</i>. to 1<i>l</i>. according to its estimated weekly
value, and while receiving this sum from his servant at the same
time drew Government rations for his support. Other assigned
servants rented farms and paid their masters in produce; and when
these 'Government men', as they were called, were unable to make
good such an engagement with their masters, they were liable to
be thrown back into their former position. Tickets of leave, on
the other hand, were freely given to those incapable of much
service to the Government or its officers; such as were useful,
whatever might be their conduct, were detained, often for an
indefinite period. Under a system so irregular, great practical
injustice was inflicted, while advantages were enjoyed by
artisans who could hire their time, and who, obtaining large
profits from their trades, indulged in every form of vice and
licentiousness. A writer in the 'Edinburgh Review', whose style
bears a strong resemblance to that of Sydney Smith, thus
satirically illustrates the system: 'A little wicked tailor
arrives, of no use to the architectural projects of the Governor;
he is turned over to a settler who allows him his liberty for
5<i>s</i>. a week, and allows him to steal and snip what, when,
and where he can. The nefarious needleman writes home that he is
as comfortable as a finger in a thimble; that, though a fraction
only of humanity, he has several wives and is filled every day
with rum and kangaroo. This, of course, is not lost upon a
shop-board, and for the saving of fifteen pence a day (to
Government) the foundation of many criminal tailors is laid.'</p>
<p>Sometimes the inequalities of treatment which seemed
inseparable from this system took a shape of almost comical
flagrancy. Thus a convict named Clapperton, who had been assigned
to a private master, and had risen to a position of trust in his
service, was guilty of large embezzlements, for which he was
tried by Captain Forster, the chief magistrate, and received a
sentence of fourteen years' imprisonment. Clapperton, however,
had the good fortune or the merit of being a skilful cook, and
the Colonial Secretary, who was then in want of a <i>chef</i>,
having first inquired whether the man's services would be
required in the Governor's kitchen, and having been informed by
Sir John's private secretary that he would 'waive the
precedence', forthwith engaged the convict in that capacity
himself. On the way to his destination Clapperton thought it
would be only neighbourly to call at his late master's and
acquaint his former fellow-servants with the stroke of luck which
had befallen him. This became known to the master, who thus found
that the prosecution he had instituted had had no other result
than that of adding to the domestic comfort of an official
friend. He accordingly brought the case to the notice of Sir John
Franklin, who at once interposed his veto on the projected
arrangement, and sent the man to labour on <i>the</i> roads. It
is hardly surprising that a case of this kind should have caused
some public sensation, and provoked unfavourable criticism of a
system which 'sent one man to toil in the chains and another to
wear the livery of the second officer of the Government.'</p>
<p>That system, however, had a right to be judged not by its
incidental abuses but by the modes of its ordinary operation.
Anomalies of the precise description of the above could evidently
be got rid of at a stroke by the simple expedient of abolishing
assignments for domestic service. The question was whether, on
the whole, and subject to the correction of these and other
miscarriages, assignment was or was not a practice conducive to
the material interests of the free settlers and the moral welfare
of the convicts themselves. And Franklin, after a careful and
dispassionate study of that question, had no doubt that it should
be answered in the affirmative. Thus he writes upon the subject
generally:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I have entirely forbid the transfer of convicts, by
which they could be removed from one service to another at the
mere wish or convenience of the master. I have also forbid
allowing convicts on assignment being hired out by the master to
work for any other person, the master securing a certain portion
of the wages, which I found to be a practice carried on to a
considerable extent, though the act was punishable by fine. I
have from the first discontinued the practice of assigning
husbands to their wives, and servants to persons holding tickets
of leave, though it is possible, notwithstanding all my care,
this may have been done in some few instances since my order was
issued.</blockquote>
<p>But this increased strictness of discipline was not
unaccompanied by reasonable efforts at reformation.</p>
<blockquote>Whenever the abstracts of petitions for indulgence
are presented to me for consideration, which is done weekly in
special cases, and monthly in general cases, I devote myself to
the examination of each case, and, whenever I find that the
prayer of the petitioner cannot be immediately granted, I state
in writing the reason, and point out his prevailing offence, and
also fix a certain period of probation for him to conquer the
habit; and, if he does, the indulgence is then granted to him at
once. My observations are directed to be forwarded to the
petitioner through the master; and I know that these warnings
have had a beneficial effect on the conduct of the prisoners. The
door of hope is thus proved to be open, and they perceive that
the recovery of indulgence depends upon their own conduct. When
the conduct of the applicant has been particularly good, I cause
my notice of it to be conveyed to him. What is this but one of
those 'moral appliances' of which the present system is said (by
the Committee) to be wholly devoid?</blockquote>
<p>Little recognition, however, of this or any other merit of the
existing system was to be expected from that body. Their report
reached Franklin after he had sat down to pen the above remarks,
and his judgment upon it is that, though drawn up with much care
and ability, he cannot look at it in any other way than as a
one-sided view of the question.' Evidence relating to a wholly
bygone state of things, and abounding in horrors which were
matters of ancient history, appeared to have formed the main
basis of the Committee's conclusions, later modifications and
amendments of the system being entirely ignored. The system of
assignment, denounced as 'slavery' by a class of politicians,
themselves the slaves, in those days as in these, of words, was
to be abolished on the strength of its nickname. Its evils were
thrust into the foreground and perpetually insisted on; the good
effected by it was minimised or denied. Nor had there been any
pretence of a desire to consider what improvements it might be
susceptible of. 'I am not its bigoted advocate,' wrote Franklin,
'and would cheerfully assist in devising a plan by which the
master and the man might mutually choose each other, and the
latter receive moderate wages; but I cannot reconcile myself to
the idea that this or any other system is to be overturned by
evidence which, if not altogether untrue, has been grossly
exaggerated and misstated as regards this colony.'</p>
<p>And what was to be substituted for this maligned and
misrepresented method of reformatory discipline? Penitentiary
systems, which, whether silent or social, did not appear to
Franklin to be 'the best schools for inducing practical habits of
labour and industry after the prisoners are released from them',
and in this respect were, in his judgment, much inferior to the
employment of convicts in agricultural pursuits, in the felling
of timber, and in mechanical labour apart from the towns. It
must, indeed, have been difficult for a Governor of Tasmania in
those days, and especially for one so eager for the material
development of the country as was Franklin, to regard with
patience such a wanton waste of human energy as the penitentiary
system involved. Unreclaimed Nature, all around him, was crying
aloud for the thews and sinews of reclaimable or irreclaimable
man.</p>
<p>Franklin's pleadings for the system of assignment were vain.
Peremptory instructions were sent to him and to the Governors of
the other Australian colonies to discontinue it. His address to
his Legislative Council at the opening of its session in 1840
records the official mandate, accompanied by such reassurances to
the anxious employers of labour as Franklin felt able to offer.
The assignment of 'domestic servants for purposes of luxury' had
been put an end to the year before, and a month previously the
practice of assignment for any purpose had, in the towns of
Hobart and Launceston, ceased to exist. These changes would not,
Franklin points out, reduce the number of prisoners who would
become eventually available for purposes of field labour. On the
contrary, it would ultimately increase that number by the
addition to it of the convicts no longer assignable for purposes
of luxury anywhere, or in the towns for any purposes whatever.
But under the new system all convicts were on arrival placed in
the public works, in what were called probationary gangs, for a
minimum period of one year; and the consequence of this arrest of
the supply of labourers, coming as it did at a time when there
happened to be a specially urgent demand for them, had been so
seriously felt that the Governor was compelled, without the
sanction of the Secretary of State, to authorise the grant of a
bounty for the encouragement of immigration.</p>
<p>To trace the vacillating policy of the Home Government, as
Colonial Secretary succeeded Colonial Secretary and one theory of
punishment ousted another, to be itself displaced by a third, is
beyond the province of this work. The loyal but ineffectual
endeavour of Franklin to work the new probationary system
successfully belongs rather to the general history of penal
discipline than to a biography of the man, and the subject,
indeed, has only been pursued thus far because his treatment of
it so strikingly illustrates the soundness of judgment and the
shrewd common-sense which he brought to his administrative work.
Unfortunately, however, it was also in connection with this
subject of penal discipline that he became involved in the first
of that series of personal differences with those about him which
marred the whole subsequent course of his official career.</p>
<p>An early 'difficulty' which arose between him and his private
secretary has already been noticed; a much more serious one was
to follow. Captain Mackonochie in truth was, if not an
'impossible' private secretary, at any rate a private secretary
in an impossible position. Officially attached to the service of
the Governor, he was, or regarded himself as, in his unofficial
capacity an emissary of an English society for the improvement of
penal discipline to inquire into and to report upon the results
of the system of transportation. He had, in fact, been furnished
by this society with a list of no fewer than sixty-seven
questions on which they desired to receive a statement of his
views. The impossibility of thus dividing himself into two
persons, and of loyally serving one master without breaking faith
with the other, would have been apparent to any one not
accustomed, like too many 'friends of humanity' at large, to
neglect his obligations to individual members of the race.
Captain Mackonochie presumably did not perceive it. He set to
work to execute his unofficial commission, and with such industry
did he pursue his inquiries that at the expiration of three
months from his arrival in the colony he felt himself in a
position to pronounce a sweeping condemnation of the system of
penal discipline prevailing in the colony. Such, at least, was
the substance of the report which he drafted and despatched to
the society for whom he was acting. Of its manner we may judge by
the following extract from the far from unfriendly criticism of
Mr. West:&mdash;'Without circumlocution or reserve he spoke of
the officers concerned in convict management as blinded by habit,
as empirics who could patch and cauterise a wound, but were
involved in the hopeless prejudices of a topical practice, and
much too far gone to comprehend improvements founded on
scientific principles. His deviations from the tone of
philosophical discussion were not numerous, but they were marked.
The chief police magistrate he compared to the lamplighter, by
whom gas is detested. In praising that officer's administrative
talent, he observed that he belonged to the martinet school, and
that his estimate of human nature depressed it below its
worth.'</p>
<p>A summary of this conciliatory document&mdash;which by
condensing rendered more flagrant the charges against the
colonists and more revolting the description of the
prisoners&mdash;found its way, by a process to be hereafter
explained, to the Colonial Office, and was handed by Lord John
Russell to the committee then inquiring into the subject of
transportation. Its next appearance was in an English newspaper,
and it was in that form that it first came under the eye of Sir
John Franklin. The report on which it was founded had indeed been
laid before him, and his opinion of it was, as might have been
expected, of a strongly adverse character. It contained, in his
judgment, afterwards avowed in correspondence with its author,
'so many incorrect and even reckless assertions as to the
condition and treatment of criminals, and so much offensive
interpretation of the character of the free population, that I
could not but feel apprehensive and even somewhat indignant at
the probability of its being made public.' The appearance in the
English press of a summary which unavoidably emphasised these
objectionable qualities, and placed the Lieutenant-Governor's
private secretary in a position of conspicuous if not
contemptuous hostility to his chief and all the principal
officials of the colony, left Franklin with but one course open
to him&mdash;to dismiss Captain Mackonochie from his post. There
was, however, no personal rupture between them; the letters
exchanged by them with reference to the incident which had
rendered this painful step necessary are couched in terms of
mutual respect and even regard; and for some time after ceasing
to be Franklin's private secretary Captain Mackonochie continued
with his wife and family to reside at Government House. But for
conclusive proof that the action taken by his chief was not only
justifiable but inevitable, we need look no further than the
admissions of the displaced official himself. Indeed, his very
explanation of the particular proceeding by which the crisis was
precipitated revealed a total incapacity to appreciate the true
relations between the Governor of a colony and his private
secretary.</p>
<p>Enough, however, of this unfortunate episode. It only now
remains to trace the history of a sequel which demonstrated both
the genuineness of Franklin's goodwill towards his former
secretary and the practical value of the latter's disciplinary
theories. Supported by an influential school of reformers at
home, but also no doubt materially assisted by the good offices
of a Governor whose recommendations would naturally derive
additional value from the fact of the personal differences
between them, Captain Mackonochie was shortly afterwards
appointed Commandant of Norfolk Island, which had been selected,
by way of halfway house to the abolition of transportation, as
the sole future destination of transported convicts. He took up
his new appointment apparently with full leave and licence to
experimentalise on the lines of his own theories. Less than a
year, however, sufficed to alarm the Home Government so
thoroughly that they would at once have recalled Captain
Mackonochie had they been provided with a successor. In little
more than two years his methods resulted in catastrophe.</p>
<p>It was on May 24, 1840, the occasion of the young Queen's
birthday, that the 'system' of the new Commandant received an
illustration which scandalised colonial opinion and proved
startling even to the boldest philanthropists of the mother
country. A proclamation had been issued by Mackonochie describing
the festivities by which he proposed to celebrate the
anniversary. He had resolved, writes Mr. West, whose sympathy
with his motives is not a whit less conspicuous than his
consciousness of the absurdity of his methods, 'to forget the
distinction between the good and bad, and to make no exception
from the general indulgence; but he entreated the men to remember
that on the success of this experiment his confidence would
greatly depend; he warned them to suppress the first tokens of
disorder, and by retiring to their quarters at the first sound of
the bugle prove that they might be trusted with safety. On the
morning of that day the signal colours floated from the staff,
crowned with the union-jack; twenty-one guns collected from the
vessels and from the Government House were mounted on the top of
a hill and fired a royal salute. The gates were thrown open, and
1,800 prisoners were set free and joined in various amusements,
of which Captain Mackonochie was a frequent spectator. Eighteen
hundred prisoners sat down to dinner, and at its close, having
received each a small quantity of spirits and water, they drank a
health to the Queen and Mackonochie. Three times three for
Victoria and the Captain rent the air. They then renewed their
sports or attended a theatrical performance. New scenery,
dresses, music, and songs contributed to the hilarity of the
party. The performances were <i>The Castle of Andalusia</i>, in
which the comic powers of the prisoners were exhibited to their
companions; a variety of glees and songs; the tent scene in
<i>Richard III.</i>; <i>The Purse, or the Benevolent Tar</i>;
[this, perhaps, by way of compliment to the Captain], and finally
the National Anthem. At the termination no accident had occurred,
the gaol was entirely unoccupied, no theft or disorder had
disgraced the day, and thus the notions of Mackonochie seemed to
be illustrated by the experiment.</p>
<p>The effect, of this extraordinary performance was, the writer
dryly continues, to give a violent shock to the 'long habit of
connecting the notions of crime and punishment with those of
guilt and misery', and, in fact, of drawing that 'distinction
between the good and the bad' which Captain Mackonochie had
resolved to 'forget' in honour of the day. The novelty of the
system 'gave to the policy of Norfolk Island the air of delirium;
the disciplinarians of the ancient <i>r&eacute;gime</i> raised
their hands with astonishment. The place, once of all most
hateful, painted by fancy, became an elysium; employment
enlivened by plays, rum, and tobacco, was described as a cheering
vicissitude in a life of crime.' It was not, however, difficult
to see, adds Mr. West&mdash;and certainly it is not difficult
even at this distance of time for a reader to guess&mdash;'that a
reaction would follow, and that any untoward accident would
produce a recoil.' For a time, however, all went well. 'It is
said that the prisoners at Norfolk Island deeply sympathised with
their chief, and that they combined in a society for mutual
reformation.' But the paper which contained the outlines of the
plan was headed, we are told, with the surely somewhat ominous
motto of the Irish Liberator:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">Hereditary bondsmen! know ye not<br>
Who would be free themselves must strike the blow?</p>
<p>They struck the blow on June 21, 1842, when twelve convicts
who had been told off to assist in unloading stores from the
Governor Phillip, made an attempt to seize the vessel. A
desperate struggle, in which several lives were lost, ensued; but
the mutineers were at length mastered and conveyed to Sydney in
the vessel they had attempted to capture. Sentenced to death,
they 'met their fate with fortitude, and their last words were in
grateful remembrance of Mackonochie.'</p>
<p>By the following year the pendulum of policy had swung back
again. Sir George Gipps, the Governor of New South Wales,
announced in an address to the Council that after one year and a
half's trial of the new discipline it was to be abandoned. The
prisoners then in Norfolk Island were transferred to Van Diemen's
Land; and the former settlement, from being a school of reform,
was converted into a limbo of the irreclaimable. The 'mark
system', which had been a capital feature of Captain
Mackonochie's scheme, had signally failed. In theory it had
seemed a felicitous idea to allow men to purchase discharge from
a seven years' sentence by accumulating 6,000 marks for good
behaviour, and from a life-sentence by 8,000. But in practice it
proved fruitful in abuses. Convicts found means of accumulating
marks without fulfilling the irksome condition of good conduct.
Convict clerks falsified the accounts, and men transferred their
marks to each other for a consideration. Moreover, they were
awarded, as indeed it must have been difficult to avoid awarding
them, for merits other than moral. Clever mechanics obtained them
by their skill, the strong earned them by their strength, and
both alike obtained an advantage over their less able or
able-bodied fellows whose behaviour may have been in no respect
inferior to theirs.</p>
<p>Captain Mackonochie's recall, which is said to have been in
contemplation from the moment the news of the birthday
festivities of 1840 reached the Home Government, was delayed for
several years by the difficulties of finding a qualified
successor; but in 1844 he was at last recalled. He left the
island, we are told, 'regretted by the prisoners', but followed
probably by feelings of a less tender character on the part of
the colonists. He was unquestionably a benevolent and
well-meaning man, but so was Mr. Walter Shandy; and if we could
conceive that philosopher suddenly elevated to the government of
a province, and empowered to apply his pet theory of 'Christian
names' or any other of his eccentric crotchets to a portion of
his subjects, he could hardly have set to work in a spirit of
more opinionated self-confidence or of rasher contempt for the
informations of common-sense and experience than did Captain
Mackonochie in Norfolk Island. His administrative record in that
settlement certainly afforded an ample ex post facto
justification of Franklin's conduct in summarily closing his
official career in Tasmania.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>
<p align="center">TASMANIAN INCIDENTS<br>
<br>
1842</p>
<p><small>IT</small> was characteristic of the insatiable
adventurer that even within the comparatively narrow limits of
his Australasian island he contrived to lose himself and an
exploring party in the hitherto unthreaded bush, from which,
indeed, they did not ultimately emerge into known or habitable
regions until after his alarmed subjects had despatched at least
one expedition for his discovery and relief.</p>
<p>Macquarrie Harbour, a port on the west coast of Tasmania,
named after a former Governor of New South Wales, was the
'objective' of the arduous and perilous march, on which Sir John
Franklin, with his wife, his niece, and their companions, set
forth in the spring of 1842. The harbour, originally employed as
a penal settlement, had been abandoned eleven years before in
consequence of its difficult approach. Not easy of access even by
sea, it was by land altogether inaccessible, being divided from
the settled districts by a strip of country some eighty or ninety
miles in width, and consisting of impervious forests, rugged
mountains, tremendous gullies, impetuous rivers, and treacherous
morasses. It is true that in the earlier portion of Colonel
Arthur's governorship prisoners were still sent thither from
other parts of the island as a punishment, but the difficulty of
keeping up its supplies by sea was so great that its use as a
convict station was at last discontinued. In the meantime,
prisoner after prisoner had endeavoured to make his escape from
it by way of the interior only to perish in the bush, or, as
happened in two or three instances, to emerge from it so utterly
worn out by fatigue and famine that the wretched fugitives were
glad to surrender themselves on their arrival at the first human
habitation. Sometimes the rash attempt had results even more
terrible. In the year 1822 a party of eight men escaped from
Macquarrie Harbour, of whom all but one perished, or were
destroyed to satisfy the hideous cravings of their
famine-maddened companions. The survivor, a man named Pearce, who
had ultimately fallen in with some bushrangers, with whom he was
taken and sent back to Macquarrie, actually made a second attempt
at escape with a fellow-prisoner of the name of Cox. For the
first and second day they strayed through the forest, on the
third they made the beach, and travelled towards Port Dalrymple
until the fifth, when they arrived at King's River. They remained
three or four days in an adjoining wood, to avoid soldiers who
were in pursuit of them, and were all the time from the period
they started without a morsel of food. Overcome by famine, each
watched for an opportunity to surprise and destroy the other,
neither daring to snatch a moment's slumber lest he should never
wake. Cox was the first to give way to exhaustion; he fell
asleep, and Pearce despatched him with an axe. On the departure
of the soldiers, the miserable wretch slunk from his retreat,
and, living on the mutilated remains of his companion, spent a
day and a night in the place which they made their encampment.
Then, overcome with horror at his useless crime, he returned to
the settlement, and, declaring himself weary of life,
surrendered, confessed his guilt, and was tried and executed.</p>
<p>It was into the region so darkly associated with these
tragedies that Franklin and his little party fearlessly plunged.
Their purpose was to thread their way through scrub and forest
and mountain gorge, over river and torrent, and round morass and
swamp, to a point near the mouth of the Gordon River, where a
little schooner, the Breeze, was to wait in readiness to convey
them the rest of the way to Macquarrie Harbour. They started in
beautiful weather and in a season, the best possible for their
purpose, of unusually prolonged drought; but before they had got
far on their journey the atmospheric conditions underwent a
complete and most untoward change. Heavy rains set in, flooding
the rivers and rendering the swampy ground impassable. For a week
they were confined to their tents in a sheltered nook under a
snowy mountain, and later on were compelled to make another
considerable stay on the banks of a swollen river, waiting for
provisions to reach them, and for a double canoe, now rendered
absolutely necessary for their further conveyance, to be rudely
fashioned out of the neighbouring pines. During the weeks of
their enforced sojourn in the Tasmanian wilderness the travellers
were entirely lost to the outer world. Neither sound nor sign of
them seems to have reached Hobart Town, and the sinister
reputation of the region in which they had disappeared tended of
course to deepen public alarm.</p>
<p>In truth, the difficulties they encountered after the rains
set in were sufficiently formidable. The swollen river, which
formed the main obstacle to their progress&mdash;the 'Franklin'
their surveyor had christened it&mdash;was some seventy or eighty
yards wide, and quite impossible, therefore, to be bridged, like
the others they had thus succeeded in crossing, by means of
fallen trees. Their pioneering party was, in consequence,
compelled to construct a rude kind of raft, which they had
fastened by a rope across the river.</p>
<blockquote>On our arrival (wrote Lady Franklin to her sister)
the flood had carried away the warp, but the raft remained. On
this, after the rise had subsided a little, two men (prisoners)
volunteered to cross, a measure necessary to be effected as soon
as possible, as the Breeze, which was waiting for us to take us
back by sea, was to leave by order on the 18th, and if gone we
should have had to make our retreat by land with increased
difficulties through the country we had already traversed. The
two men on the raft were whirled round in an eddy as soon as they
pushed from the shore, and, unable to cross, were carried down
the river over some rapids and disappeared from our eyes round a
bend of the stream. Sir John declared, however, he had no doubt
of their safety (they had been Thames and Bridgewater bargemen),
and in half an hour afterwards their voices were heard on the
opposite side 'coo-ee-ing' (the universal colonial cry learned
from the natives), and, having given us that notice of their
existence and safety, they darted deep into the forest on their
mission, which was to arrest the Breeze in its
departure.</blockquote>
<p>The efforts of the two trusty convicts were successful. They
stopped the schooner when on the point of sailing, and the
Franklin party eventually made their way to it in safety. But the
pluck and loyalty of these criminal pioneers were virtues common
to all their fellow-convicts engaged in this service. Few
stranger or more paradoxical scenes have perhaps been ever
witnessed even in a penal settlement than that which Lady
Franklin here goes on so graphically to describe. After
enumerating the members of their party, eight in all, she
continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The crew of the Breeze consists only of five persons,
and a stranger to the country (particularly if he was a member of
the former Transportation Committee) would take it for granted
that twenty stout able-bodied convicts (chosen expressly for this
service, because they are such) would find it an easy matter to
overcome the resistance of thirteen persons, of whom two are
women, and, taking possession of the Breeze, carry her off as
masters and free. No such idea probably entered any of their
heads. With the exception of trying whenever they could to get
more than their share of our scanty provisions, which probably
many free men of their rank in life would have done equally at
home in similar circumstances, they have behaved admirably well,
and we have all encamped together at night within a few yards of
each other in open tents, without a guard and without a firearm
among us, or a single instrument of defence against the axes and
tomahawks which were continually in their keeping. You may think
it was because the Governor was of the party, and that they all
had much to hope from him, even though under the circumstances
they could have little to fear; and this is true, for they all
look for indulgence for this service&mdash;that is to say, some
alleviation of sentence according to law&mdash;and were promised
it on good behaviour; but, as far as safety be concerned, the
sense of security would have been enjoyed just as much, I
believe, by any other set of travellers as
ourselves.</blockquote>
<p>The safe return of the party was welcomed with the greatest
relief by the colonists, who had, in fact, almost given them up
for lost. New South Wales took an even more despairing view of
the situation than Tasmania; Sir George Gipps afterwards writing
to Franklin to say that at Sydney the only difference of opinion
as to their fate was as to whether they had been starved or
drowned. They had indeed been at various times in very real
danger of both these fates and, had the schooner sailed without
them, it is but too probable that none of the party would ever
have seen Hobart Town again.</p>
<p>Nor does this tale of perilous adventure end with their
return. On their arrival at Hobart Town they found that a party
of six prisoners had been sent out in search of them, and, as
nothing had been heard of these men for some time, it became
necessary to despatch a third expedition for the rescue of the
rescuers, who, as it turned out, were themselves only narrowly
saved from death by starvation. Arriving at Macquarrie Harbour
after the Franklin party had left, they pursued their way along
the coast in the expectation of finding traces of the explorers
at some point on the shore. They consumed all their provisions,
and, being at last stopped by a river which they had not strength
to ford, they retraced their steps. After having been reduced to
such straits for food that they had to devour their leather
knapsacks, they at last regained a little canoe which they had
constructed and left behind them, and got to a deserted island in
Macquarrie Harbour, where they found potatoes growing wild from
those originally planted there ten years before. After a few
days' rest, four of the men with a small store of potatoes
embarked again in their canoe for the Gordon River, where they
left it. Plunging into the forest, they came to the Franklin, and
crossed it in a canoe abandoned there by the Franklin party,
which unfortunately filled and sank with their store of potatoes
during the passage. Here providentially, at a moment when,
according to their own account, they could not have held out
another day, they fell in with the second relief party and were
saved.</p>
<p>The two men left on the island were rescued by a boat sent
from a ship which had been driven ashore. They, too, were reduced
to the last extremity; their scanty stock of potatoes was almost
exhausted, and they were on the point of building themselves
another canoe with the view of attempting an escape from the
island when the relief arrived. 'For myself,' writes Lady
Franklin, 'I have suffered mentally very much indeed on the
subject. It would have been a bitter pang for life if these poor
fellows had perished in their attempt to rescue us. . . . Their
image haunted me day and night, and you would be surprised to see
how much this with other anxieties since our return from
Macquarrie Harbour has worn and aged me.'</p>
<p>To a slightly earlier date in Franklin's administration than
that of this too exciting journey belongs the following letter,
interesting in right not indeed of its contents but of its
author, the minutest scrap of whose correspondence is justly
valued by the world:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="right"><small>Park Lane: Feb. 13,
1841.</small>    </p>
<blockquote>My dear Sir John,&mdash;Hearing at Lady
Blessington's, a few nights back, that her brother, Mr. Power,
was about to embark for the seat of your government in an
official character, I could not resist availing myself of the
occasion to communicate with a very old and very valued friend. I
trust that Lady Franklin and yourself find health in the
Tasmanian breezes, which, I hear, are very renovating, and I only
hope the magic power of steam may some day, and perhaps soon,
permit me to pay you a visit. In that case I shall have the
pleasure of introducing you to Mrs. Disraeli, a lady who passed
her Christmas last year at Bradenham in reading your adventures
towards the Coppermine River, and who would be very much
gratified in making the acquaintance of the hero of both Poles.
You will be glad to learn that your old friends at Bradenham are
well; but my father, I deeply lament to say, though with
apparently an unbroken constitution, has been stricken with
blindness, for him a peculiarly dreadful visitation.<br>
<br>
Last year, on our road between Augsburg and Munich, I met Mr.
Griffin and Mrs. Simpkinson. He really seems younger than ever. I
can only wish her the good fortune to seem as young as she always
does.<br>
<br>
We are apparently in this country on the eve of a change of
government, which renders the world of politics turbid and
excited. I hope, whoever may be in power, the colonial interests
of this country will be maintained; and I know no better mode
than appointing governors as able and efficient as yourself.<br>
<br>
You will find Mr. Power a very amiable man. I have always heard
him highly spoken of, and can personally answer for his agreeable
manners. Pray make my kindest remembrances acceptable to Lady
Franklin, and believe me ever,</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="right">My dear Sir John, yours very
faithfully,      <br>
<small>B. DISRAELI.</small>   </p>
<p>Among other pleasant incidents of this chequered Tasmanian
time is to be numbered the Governor's renewal of relations with
the staunch comrade of his first Arctic expedition, John Hepburn.
On his return to England in 1822 Franklin used his best exertions
to procure from the naval authorities some fitting recognition of
his late follower's services. A letter is extant addressed by him
to Admiral Sir Byam Martin, then Comptroller of the Navy, in
which he most warmly advocates Hepburn's claims&mdash;'the only
English seaman', as he says, 'who accompanied me to the shores of
the Arctic sea, and who, during the whole time he was attached to
the expedition, conducted himself with a degree of intelligence
and zeal that called forth my repeated encomiums.' His conduct
'during a period of extreme difficulty and distress', adds his
late commander, 'was so humane and excellent as to merit the
highest promotion that his situation in life entitles him to.
When the officers were unable to advance any further he alone
remained with them voluntarily, and at the imminent hazard of his
own life. To his exertions at a period when his bodily weakness
was extreme, Dr. Richardson and myself are indebted, under
Providence, for our lives.'</p>
<p>Lord Bathurst, before whom a more detailed statement of
Hepburn's services had been laid, had recommended him to the
notice of the First Lord of the Admiralty for promotion; and Lord
Melville, also sensible of his merits, had expressed his
intention of speaking to the Comptroller on the subject of
procuring some situation for him. Franklin, indeed, had
previously had an interview with Sir Byam Martin, the substance
of which was by desire reduced to writing in the letter from
which the above extracts are taken. We may take it that the
application was successful, but that Hepburn's employment was
either not permanent or not permanently satisfactory. It is, at
any rate, certain that he reopened communications with Franklin
some fifteen or sixteen years later, after the latter's
appointment to his colonial post, and that, Franklin having
responded with his usual kindness. Hepburn came out to Tasmania
to be provided by the Governor with some more profitable
situation than he could obtain in England. Some time afterwards
the following correspondence, excellently illustrative of
Franklin's untiring goodness of heart, took place between them.
'My dear Hepburn,' the Governor writes to him with all the
<i>bonhomie</i> of a sailor addressing an old shipmate,</p>
<blockquote>I heard yesterday that you are not satisfied with
your situation, and that you have expressed disappointment with
your prospects in this country and some regret at having left
England. This information has given me much concern; for though,
as you remember, I did not urge you to come out with me, but at
first discouraged your quitting England, I yet felt happy after
you had decided, in the hope of being able to procure for you
some comfortable situation. I appointed you, in consequence, to
the very first that was vacant, the Superintendent of Government
House, and when the present situation became vacant, which was
more lucrative and of a higher class, I immediately offered it to
you. I have had some reason to fear it is a situation the duties
of which are not exactly suited to your taste; but I have not had
any other vacant which you are better qualified to fill, or that
at all equals your present office in emolument and advantages. At
one time, when I thought it not improbable there might be a
vacancy in the situation of Harbour Master, you will recollect
that I asked whether that appointment would suit you, and that
you thought you were not now qualified to fill its duties with
any degree of satisfaction to yourself or to the public. My first
desire ever has been, and still is, to show my regard and esteem
for you; and I beg of you to let me know what situation you
consider yourself better qualified to fill, or that would be more
agreeable to your feelings, and I would endeavour to place you in
such a position when a vacancy and opportunity occur. I cannot
make situations, you must well know; and I cannot know your
wishes unless you communicate them to me. You must, therefore,
write to me as soon as possible, and inform me as to your present
feelings and wishes, and you may rely on the unaltered desire of
my heart to prove myself your true and sincere
friend,</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="right"><small>JOHN
FRANKLIN.</small>   </p>
<p>Hepburn's answer, with due correction of the old sailor's
somewhat breezy orthography, was in these terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your
Excellency's letter of the 15th inst, which I did not receive
until last night, having been missent from Campbelltown to
Launceston. I beg leave to state that your Excellency has been
misinformed respecting the complaints said to have been made by
me. In place of having expressed disappointment at my prospects
in this country or regret at leaving England, I beg to assure
your Excellency that it is quite the reverse with me; and, since
I have been in the country, I have added more to my stock of this
world's riches than I did for the preceding twelve years. That I
ever expressed dissatisfaction with my present situation is also
untrue. I am sensible that everything has been done here to make
me comfortable. I acknowledge for the first six months that I
often did feel at a loss for words to express my disapprobation
of the conduct of boys when brought before me. From this
circumstance alone I did feel uncomfortable and dissatisfied with
myself, and supposed that I was not a suitable person for such a
responsible situation. But in no other way have I ever had
occasion to complain. I well remember your Excellency's anxiety
to serve me before I left England, and I trust that I shall never
be found ungrateful for the kindness I have received, or so
deceitful to a kind benefactor as to make complaints in any
quarter except to your Excellency. If it were not presuming too
far, I would beg to be confronted with the individual who has
thus so basely misled your Excellency. I am perfectly satisfied
with my present situation, it suits me very well; my only fear is
not suiting it. My wish is to remain until I can save about two
hundred pounds. Then, if my wife will come out, we shall have
enough to stock a small farm, should such be in your Excellency's
power to grant. I have received a letter from Her Majesty's
Paymaster-General containing four forms, one of which I enclose
herewith for your Excellency's inspection, being fearful that I
am doing wrong in receiving a pension while I hold such a
lucrative Government situation. Captain Booth has sent for me
within the last hour, and read a letter from the Colonial
Secretary offering an appointment at George Town, which I believe
would suit me very well; and I feel very thankful for your
Excellency's kindness. Captain Booth has in the kindest manner
expressed his satisfaction with my services here; but, being very
comfortable where I am, I beg to decline to accept it. And I have
the honour to be, &amp;c.</blockquote>
<p>Before taking final leave of these unofficial or semi-official
passages in Sir John Franklin's career in Tasmania it still
remains to record two of its most, memorable incidents&mdash;one
of them touched with all the romance of past adventure and of the
memory of a cherished comradeship, the other fraught, for us at
any rate, if unconsciously to all the actors in it, with the more
tragic interest afterwards lent it by a fatal future.</p>
<p>No one could fail to be impressed by the singular chance which
had brought Franklin, at the age of fifty, to occupy a post of
authority in that very region of the world which, as a lad of
fourteen, he had assisted to explore. The memory of those far-off
days in the Investigator&mdash;days full of young enthusiasm, and
not free from youthful mischief&mdash;must have many a time
recurred to his mind; he may often have smiled at the
recollection of the thoroughly middy-like trick by which he
secured to himself the honour of annexing the Australian
continent, symbolically at any rate, to the British Empire. The
Investigator had lost one of its boats, which capsized and
disappeared with its crew of seven men and a young officer, as it
was returning to the ship. Franklin and several others were
landed and sent out on the 'Heads' to watch for the appearance of
any corpse that might be washed up on the rocks. Each carried a
flag, which was to be unfurled as a signal in case any such
object should come in view.</p>
<p>The temptation so obviously suggested to an ambitious middy by
finding himself on the shore of a newly discovered continent with
the union-jack in his hands was too much for the youthful
Franklin. To have first descried or to have failed to descry the
floating body of one of his drowned messmates was a mere detail:
the really important thing was to be the first to unfurl the
British flag on the coast of New Holland. It was accordingly not
long before that beloved emblem was fluttering proudly in the
breeze. In another moment a boat was lowered from the
Investigator and was seen approaching the shore. It became
necessary for Franklin either to discover one of the lost
sailors, or to admit that the supposed signal had been in reality
only intended to proclaim the annexation of the Australian
continent to the British Empire. He chose the former alternative,
and, pointing to a white object on the shore at some distance, he
asked the officer in command of the boat whether he did not think
that 'that white thing' was a dead body. The officer looked with
interest at the crack in the rocks which was thus brought to his
notice, and thought that it was a dead body. Indeed, he was for a
short time pretty sure it was, while Franklin was 'sure of
nothing but of the sweet consciousness that he had realised the
longing of his boyish ambition.' No doubt, as his wife adds, 'it
was a very young trick'; but a daughter of sixteen is not, or in
those days was not, apt to be critical of her father's youthful
escapades, and it is therefore not surprising to hear that,
'though not of the first order of merit, it seemed very much to
Eleanor's taste.' When, however, she told one or two people that
'her papa was the first who had unfolded the British flag in this
part of the world when first discovered by Flinders, they looked
almost incredulous.' That great navigator seemed to the South
Australians almost as far removed from them as Tasman from the
people of Tasmania. They looked upon him as a being not only of
another generation, but of another century.</p>
<p>It was to Lady Franklin, while on a visit to South Australia,
that the idea of erecting a memorial to Flinders on the scene of
his greatest exploring triumph first suggested itself; and after
a journey from Port Lincoln to Adelaide, the project, she says,
'had become an absolute mission in her eyes.' For in the near
neighbourhood of this port, rising in an insulated and conical
form to a height of some thousand or twelve hundred feet from the
shore, stood the rock which the explorer had ascended to take the
bearings of the gulf. This eminence, named by him after the town
of Stamford in his native county, was obviously the very spot
designated alike by nature and history for a monument to his
memory. There was, however, a difficulty about the appropriation
of a site. Land could not be purchased in anything smaller than
eighty-acre lots; and to purchase such an extent of mountain, all
stone and scrub, for the sake of securing an area of only a few
feet, seemed a rather imperfect adjustment of means to ends.
Colonel Gawler, however, the then Governor of South Australia,
obligingly disposed of the difficulty by promising to make the
site of the monument a Government reserve. Thus sanctioned and
aided, Lady Franklin and her party started from Adelaide in a
small schooner of about 100 tons, and, having landed at the foot
of Stamford Hill, they ascended it, identified Flinders's
bearings, and marked the spot.</p>
<p>The captain of their little vessel, himself a Lincolnshire
man, was much interested in the expedition, and 'bore on his back
up the rugged ascent the heavy box containing the azimuth
compass' required for the identification of the spot 'on which
Flinders (from whose ponderous quarto we were provided with the
necessary extract) fixed his theodolite.' The captain's wife
played an involuntary, though to her not an unpleasing part in
the ceremony, as Lady Franklin thus amusingly relates:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Poor Mrs. Blackbourne's pocket-handkerchief was
seized by me by mistake, for when I found a white rag was wanted,
I put back my hand without turning my head to the person close to
me, who I thought was Eleanor, saying, 'Give me your
handkerchief, my dear', and did not discover my mistake till the
titterings and looks around me made me turn round. Mrs.
Blackbourne's blushes and pleased looks convinced me I had
committed a very venial mistake, and I therefore made no
difficulty in retaining my spoil. Since my return to Hobart Town,
I have sent the young person, who was then a bride of three weeks
old, a cambric handkerchief of surpassing fineness, trimmed with
deep lace, in room of the one she so obligingly allowed to be
raised upon Stamford Hill, and in remembrance of that pleasant
visit.</blockquote>
<p>The next step was to decide upon the character of the memorial
to be raised. 'Sir John', Lady Franklin reports, 'is extremely
well satisfied with my doings, and has not even asked me what the
memorial is to cost, which, indeed, I am not able to tell till I
get the opinion of Mr. Frome (the Surveyor-General) on its
dimensions; but I hope it will not be extravagant, if the stone
on the spot is made use of.'</p>
<p>Its cost appears to have been 250<i>l</i>.; its form that of
an obelisk, bearing the following inscription from the pen of Mr
Gell:&mdash;</p>

VAN DIEMEN'S LAND.</small></p>
<p>The second of the two interesting events above referred to as
marking the closing years of Franklin's administration was the
despatch of the Antarctic expedition under Captain Ross. It may
be imagined with what sympathetic enthusiasm this project was
regarded by the famous explorer of the other Pole, and with what
zeal and ardour he devoted himself to its furtherance. Hobart
Town was for some time the headquarters of the two officers
commissioned to execute it; it was there that they made, or at
any rate completed, the preparations for their journey; and it
was thence they started upon their voyage. The officer in chief
command was the Governor's intimate and attached friend, and
received from him every assistance which it was in his power to
render in the work of equipment for their arduous enterprise, a
service which is amply acknowledged by Sir James Ross in his
'Voyage of Discovery and Research in the Southern and Antarctic
Regions during the Years 1839-43.' In the report which the
Council of the Royal Society had been requested by the Government
to furnish, and which was appended to Captain Ross's
instructions, much stress was laid upon the making of magnetic
observations in Van Diemen's Land. When the expedition arrived at
Hobart Town on August 16, 1840, the first thought of its
commander was to procure the construction as soon as possible of
the permanent observatory which he was instructed to erect there.
His satisfaction may be imagined when he discovered the zeal with
which the Governor had thrown himself into the project, and
learned that the materials of which the building was to be
constructed according to a plan sent out from England had been
for months in readiness. Nothing remained but to select a site,
which was done on the following morning; and by the afternoon a
party of 200 convicts were at work digging the foundation,
shaping the blocks of freestone which were to be its base and the
solid pillars of the same materials which were to support the
instruments, and bringing the prepared timbers from the
Government store.</p>
<p>This was a pretty expeditious commencement of a public work,
and its progress was marked by equal despatch. Under Franklin's
daily personal superintendence the building of the observatory
proceeded so rapidly that the whole was completed and roofed in,
the stone pillars fixed upon the solid sandstone rock, the
instruments placed upon them, and all their delicate adjustments
completed by August 27&mdash;a space of nine days, surely the
quickest thing on record in observatory-building. Sir James Ross
writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I should be doing injustice to my own feelings were I
to neglect to express my admiration of the cheerful enthusiasm
which the convicts employed in the building displayed throughout
the work. As an instance of this, I may mention that after they
had been labouring from six o'clock on Saturday morning until ten
at night, seeing that a few hours' more work would complete the
roofing in, they entreated permission to finish it before they
left off; but as it would have broken in upon the Sabbath morning
their request was very properly refused. This is only one of
several such instances of disinterested zeal in the cause, for
from their unfortunate situation they could not derive any
benefit from their additional labour, and must have on the
occasion above mentioned suffered much fatigue from their
unusually prolonged exertions.</blockquote>
<p>There was less, one may suspect, of 'disinterested zeal in the
cause' of science on the part of the convicts than of eager
desire to please a Governor to whom they were devotedly attached.
It was a case of 'personal magnetism', not of the cosmical
variety.</p>
<p>Nor were Franklin's services to the expedition confined to
superintending the construction of their observatory. He took an
active part, as of course he was well qualified to do, in
assisting and furthering the observations. On September 23 it
became necessary, too, for Ross to avail himself of 'the aid of
volunteers under Sir John Franklin, who in his zeal for the
advancement of science took his share of the duties of that
day.'</p>
<p>That the voyage was not lacking in adventure will appear from
the following passage of a letter dated Falklands, May 2, 1842,
and addressed to Franklin by an officer of the
expedition:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>You will be glad to hear of our safe arrival after
our this time truly desperate cruise&mdash;forty-six days beset
in the packed ice, not getting clear until February 2.
Notwithstanding both ships losing their rudders, fitting new
ones, we yet penetrated to 78&deg; 11' S. and 160&deg; W.,
tracing 150 miles of our last year's barrier further to the
eastward, still preserving the same appearance. No land did we
see; our soundings were from 190 to 200 fathoms along the walls
of it. Heavy ice and rapidly forming young ice obliged us, on
February 20, to bear away along the pack edge, tracing 1,100
miles of the most desperate work, and no ships ever had a more
narrow escape from total destruction than we had in running our
longitude down in the 60th degree. On March 13, in 147&deg; W.,
blowing a gale of wind with a heavy sea, and pitch dark, a little
past midnight, Captain Ross on deck, while close reefing the
main-topsail, a very large iceberg was seen close to us on the
starboard bow.</blockquote>
<p>The ship running before the wind, her helm was put a-starboard
to avoid the threatened danger, when at that moment an iceberg
appeared on the larboard bow of her consort, and, on the latter
immediately porting her helm, the two ships came into violent
collision, the bowsprit of the former being carried away and
their topmasts and foreyards remaining entangled for upwards of
ten minutes.</p>
<blockquote>No words of mine can convey an idea of the truly
awful situation. Each crash you would have thought must be the
last. However, after tearing the strengthening piece from the
bows, the two ships parted company. We set the fragments of our
main-topsail and fore-and-aft sails to try to weather the berg,
which now towered fully 150 feet over, and drifted for more than
half a mile along its perpendicular face. The heavy sea dashing
against it fell off on board; it was only the violent drawback of
the sea that kept us off. Had we once struck upon it the ship
must have been dashed to pieces.</blockquote>
<p>It may be imagined with what interest Franklin accompanied his
friends in imagination on their adventurous voyage, and how often
he must have longed to exchange the storms of the Hobart Town
Council Chamber for those of the Antarctic Sea. The results of
the cruise are matters of geographical history, but Franklin's
account of them in a letter to his wife, then in New South Wales,
may here be given:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I write to inform you of Ross's return after a
successful voyage within the Antarctic Circle, being anxious that
you should receive the intelligence as early as possible. He
proceeded from hence to the Auckland and Campbell Islands, where
he procured the magnetic observations which he wished, and thence
set forth to the southward. The ships entered the Antarctic
Circle on January 1. The sea was there much encumbered with ice,
and stormy weather caused other obstructions to their progress.
However, Ross discovered land in the 70th degree south, which he
traced to the 78th, and there, in the meridian of about 176&deg;
E., his further progress in that direction was stopped by a
barrier of ice steep as a wall and about 150 feet in height. This
he then skirted in the hope of finding some opening for his
ships, but none was to be seen, and at last he was obliged by the
formation of the new ice, which threatened to enclose the ships,
to retreat to the northward. He was defeated in his attempts to
effect a landing on the main shore; but he succeeded on two small
islands, one of them far to the south, which I believe he has
named Franklin, from the name being attached to two specimens of
rock brought from it which are on the table in the drawing-room.
Ross, however, with his diffidence, has not even spoken to me
about the island. The sea was so free from ice when he was
sailing south beyond the 71st parallel that Ross was sanguine of
passing over the pole of the earth when the unlucky barrier
appeared. Near the extremity of their southern limit they
discovered two volcanic mountains of great height, one of them
emitting flame and smoke, which Ross has very appropriately
called 'Erebus' and the other 'Terror'. They saw land over the
ice as far as 79&deg; S.<br>
<br>
By the observations which Ross obtained to the south, to the
north-west, and in the direction of the Magnetic Pole, he has
been enabled to fix the position of it with as much accuracy as
if he had been so fortunate as to reach the spot. He could not
get within 160 miles of it. In sailing to the N.W. of his own
discoveries in returning, the ships ran for eighty miles over
mountains and other land which the American Exploring Expedition
had laid down in their charts, and thus has stamped the proper
value on their pretended discoveries in this quarter. . . . In
fact, he has had complete success in his first undertaking, and I
am happy to say without a single casualty or accident having
occurred. The officers, crews, and ships are all in perfect
condition. When the ships were first reported to be in sight, I
felt most anxious and set off as soon as possible to meet Ross.
My mind, however, was relieved before I got on board by the crew
manning the yards and giving three hearty cheers. Ross was
delighted to find that the officers at the observatory had been
as energetic and persevering at their duties as his own
companions, of which he received proof on landing by Kay laying
before him the registers of their very numerous observations
brought up to the preceding hour and ready to be at once
forwarded to England. The only disappointment Ross has felt was
at your absence at the time of his return, and in his expression
of regret he was heartily joined by all his officers as well as
by his own circle. However, we look forward to your early return,
and I hope the ships will remain till you do.</blockquote>
<p>The ships remained at Hobart Town for more than another month,
and their stay there was signalised by an incident which, though
slight in itself, cannot fail to strike any one at all curious of
dramatic coincidence. It was singular enough that the Erebus and
Terror, those two companion vessels which had done so much and
were destined to do yet more battle with the Arctic ice, should
have been selected for a service which brought them, at the other
Pole of the world, into such close contact with the last
commander that the Erebus was ever to have; but this strange
accident was to be yet more strikingly emphasised. During the
sojourn of the explorers at the port of Hobart Town the
hospitalities customary in such cases were exchanged between
ships and shore, and among the Franklin papers of the year 1841
is still preserved one of those usually 'trivial, fond records'
of past festivities to which later events have lent a pathetic
significance. It is the invitation card to a ball which was given
on board the Erebus by the officers of that ship and of the
Terror, and which the Government House party duly honoured with
their presence. Virgil himself could have asked for no more
grimly ironic commentary on his apostrophe of the</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">Nescia mens hominum fati
sortisque futur&aelig;!</p>
<p>than this light-hearted meeting of Crozier and Franklin, host
and guest, on the deck of the doomed vessel which five years
later was to bear the elder and accompany the younger to their
Arctic grave, and to leave her own stout timbers, so gaily
trodden throughout that warm southern night by the tripping feet
of the dancers, to be slowly crushed in the cruel clutch of the
ice-pack amid the iron fastnesses of the Pole.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>
<p align="center">FRANKLIN AND MONTAGU<br>
<br>
1841-1844</p>
<p><small>IT</small> was the warning counsel of Greek wisdom to
'call no man happy till he is dead;' and what is true of the
natural life has assuredly no less apt an application to an
official career.</p>
<p>Safely to attribute happiness to the record of an Australasian
governorship&mdash;especially in the uneasy times of our colonial
history half a century ago&mdash;it was imperatively necessary to
await its end. To any one who had watched Sir John Franklin's
administration from a distance, who had noted the useful public
works in which it abounded, the energy and success with which he
promoted the material and moral development of the colony, the
esteem and even affection which he won from the colonists as a
community, it might have seemed incredible that a career in many
ways so prosperous should be destined to so stormy a close. Nor
even for one who most carefully follows the course of the events
detailed in the course of this and the succeeding chapter is it
easy, if indeed it is possible, to master the whole secret of
their explanation. That the Governor was surrounded by factious
and intriguing subordinates, that his policy was sustained with
little loyalty, and often thwarted by petty spite on the part of
those from whom he had a right to expect co-operation, that his
chief adviser was a man of obstinate and masterful will, who may
have cherished, as he was suspected of cherishing, ambitions
inconsistent with faithful service to his chief&mdash;all this is
patent enough as matter of actual fact, but is insufficient as
explanatory material. These difficulties of his administration
were known to Franklin from the first; he had to reckon and to
grapple with them from the very outset of his term; and it is not
at first sight easy to understand how it was that after
contending with them not unsuccessfully for a space of five years
they should at last have overcome him.</p>
<p>Had he been other than the man which he had already proved
himself to be, his failure would have been comprehensible enough.
Many a man distinguished in the domain of action has before this
proved himself utterly destitute of the qualities necessary to
success in counsel. Energy and daring do not always go hand in
hand with tact and discretion; the faculty of command is not
invariably accompanied by the power of persuasion; a high and
resolute spirit is often associated with an overbearing temper.
But Franklin was no mere imperious martinet, no headlong and
headstrong autocrat, deaf to criticism and impatient of
opposition, and riding roughshod over the opinions and
susceptibilities of those around him. On the contrary, he had
already in his Greek mission proved his possession of all the
moral and intellectual weapons of the diplomatist; he had shown
his power of bringing an untiring patience, an imperturbable
temper, and an inexhaustible ingenuity to the accomplishment of
objects which he was forbidden to attempt, or could not hope to
achieve, by force. How came it, then, we are constrained to ask
ourselves, that he failed in a task for which the principal if
not the sole and sufficient instrument might have been supposed
to be simply skill in the management of men? How was it that he
was unable to handle hostile and insubordinate colonial officials
with the adroitness which he displayed in dealing with slippery
Levantine adventurers and intriguing Muscovite colleagues?</p>
<p>No complete answer to these questions is now perhaps
forthcoming, but a reply practically sufficient for its purpose
and far from discreditable to Franklin may be deduced, it seems
to me, from a comparison or rather a contrast between the
circumstances of his Tasmanian administration and those of his
Mediterranean command. It was not merely that in the Gulf of
Patras he had the advantages which he lacked at Hobart
Town&mdash;untrammelled authority and a free hand; that in the
former case his duty was to act with promptitude and decision,
and take the judgment of his official superiors afterwards, while
in the latter case action could not always or even generally be
taken until the views if not the wills of advisers had been
consulted and objections of the captious and sometimes perhaps
even insincere or malicious order had been laboriously refuted or
in the last resort overruled.</p>
<p>To these new conditions of public service he could doubtless
have accommodated himself. It was not the difference between the
circumstances of the two missions which led to their unhappy
divergence of result; it was the difference between the moral
attitudes which he respectively assumed towards them. The Greeks,
official or insurgent, were approached by him in the neutral
spirit and frigid temper of the diplomatist. The objects which he
sought to attain&mdash;the protection, that is to say, of British
interests, and, so far as possible, the preservation of
international order&mdash;were substantially identical with the
ends which every commander of a British war-ship has a standing
commission to keep in view. It was no more of a tax upon
Franklin's patience to watch the shifts and stratagems of
Hellenic cunning, nor any heavier demand upon his vigilance and
dexterity to counteract them, than he would have found it to have
to await the proper moment and select the best position for an
attack upon an enemy's ship.</p>
<p>But he was unable, and it was a generous inability, to
approach his colonial colleagues as he approached the Greeks. He
could not bring himself to regard them as so many human
instruments to be used for certain definite purposes, as so much
flesh-and-blood material to be moulded into, or as nearly as
possible into, certain desired shapes. That is the way in which
men are regarded by the ideal 'manager of men', but to observe
such bloodless 'counsels of perfection' as these was utterly
beyond John Franklin's power. It needed a colder heart and a less
sympathetic temperament than his to be able to treat his
colleagues on the council board after any such ungenial plan. No
man was ever less fitted by nature to act on the more cynical
portion of the famous advice of him who has counselled us always
to 'treat a friend as if he might become an enemy, and an enemy
as if he might become a friend.' To the latter recommendation,
indeed, he would have promptly and cheerfully responded, but the
former principle he would have regarded as morally hateful, and,
for himself at any rate, practically impossible of
application.</p>
<p>How, indeed, he would have asked himself, could he possibly
apply it to any of the men around him? Were they not all English
gentlemen like himself, all servants of the British Crown, under
the same obligation as himself to promote the interests of the
colony and the Empire by every means in their power, and, above
all, to see that, in the memorable words of the Duke of
Wellington, whatever else happened, the government of his
sovereign 'should be carried on'? It was foreign to his nature to
believe that any conscientious difference of opinion on questions
of policy could ever array such men in personal hostility to
himself, and it would be an insult to them to assume the
necessity of treating them with the cautious reserve of a chief
who saw a possible enemy in every one of them. So far from that,
the kindly and open-hearted nature of the Governor but too
strongly prompted him to extend not only his confidence but his
friendship to any of those about him who seemed to invite it
without too critically considering whether they were worthy of
it. It was instinctive with him to seek to establish cordial and
even affectionate relations with those under his control. Such a
mode of government has its advantages, but it is also not without
those dangers which proverbially attend the intrusion of
'sentiment' into 'business'. So long as the official machine runs
smoothly, the chief who cultivates intimacy with his staff is no
doubt served with a zeal and devotion which can never be
commanded by one who, as the phrase is, 'keeps them at a
distance'. But in the event of 'difficulties' arising between him
and them the pre-existing intimacy is apt to react upon the
situation with disastrous effect. Feelings of private injury add
a sting to the irritation of public controversy; the warmth
engendered by argumentative collision is inflamed by a sense of
ill-requited friendliness and by resentment at real or fancied
ingratitude; and the official dispute at last assumes the
bitterness of a personal quarrel.</p>
<p>The influence of such a revulsion of feeling seems plainly
traceable in the history of Franklin's difference with the most
powerful and highly placed of his colleagues, and indeed, though
in a less degree, in his conflicts with the other officials of
whom he fell foul. In every instance one can plainly perceive
that the irritation, never more than slight with sensible men,
which a mere conflict of wills is apt to produce was indefinitely
intensified by the smart of wounded susceptibilities, and that in
each case the Governor's impulse was to regard his opponent not
merely as a troublesome colleague, but to a certain extent as a
faithless friend. It thus became impossible for him to take a
tolerant view of those mere tactical devices of controversy which
disputants whose personal feelings are not engaged find it easy
to permit to their adversaries. To Franklin such strategy, purely
defensive as it was, appeared only an additional cause of
offence. Himself the soul of candour, a 'plain-dealer', to use an
old-fashioned term, of the most uncompromising kind, he was
angrily impatient of any conduct in others which seemed to him to
savour of obliquity or chicane, and it did not seem to occur to
him that, as human nature is constituted, it is idle to expect
absolute and unreserved self-disclosure from an opponent who is
fighting for a victory on which his official position and
prospects depend.</p>
<p>Thus, from resenting tactics which less sensitive men might
have tolerated, Franklin went on to take that further step which
is always so easy to a zealous and conscientious administrator in
such circumstances. He began to feel a stronger and stronger
indignation on behalf of the public service, struck at, as he
conceived, in his own person. The men who were making this 'dead
set' at him were also obstructing the government and imperilling
the welfare of the colony committed by his Sovereign to his
charge. Once convinced of this, his mere professional instincts
and the training and traditions of his life impelled him to
decided courses. It was almost inevitable that the civil Governor
at loggerheads with his colleagues should have at last come to
regard himself as a naval commander confronted with mutineers,
and to deal with opposition in a manner so summary as to a
certain extent to justify the criticism that he mistook his
council chamber for the quarter-deck of a man-of-war.</p>
<p>No account, however, of these Tasmanian troubles would be
adequate which did not include some estimate of Lady Franklin's
innocent share in aggravating them. For innocent it was, in the
strictest sense of the word, at least if a right to such a
description can be earned by the absolute unselfishness of
motives which began and ended in a benevolent desire to promote
the moral and material interests of the colony, and a wifely
ambition to contribute to the success and credit of her husband's
rule. That her zeal was never in any instance untempered by
discretion it would be too much to say. Prudence so unfailing and
invariable amid circumstances often of extreme difficulty is not
given to mortal man, still less to mortal woman. But this at
least may be said in Lady Franklin's case, that her entanglement
in the dispute between her husband and his colleagues was not the
result of any unguarded word which may have fallen from her or
incautious act into which she may have been betrayed. By this I
mean that, though a connection might be plausibly traced between
such word or act and the events that followed, it is assuredly
not the fact that the avoidance of the indiscretion would have
saved her from the entanglement. From that nothing would have
saved her, except perhaps (for even thus much is not certain) an
avowed and inflexible refusal to express, or even to admit having
formed, an opinion of her own on public affairs. Even this, it
must be repeated, would not have absolutely insured her against
misrepresentation, for it is always possible for those whose
interest it is to do so to insist that the wife of a Governor is
'a power behind the throne', and even to find proof of the charge
in the very fact that she, as they would put it, 'ostentatiously'
disclaimed all concern with political affairs. Had Lady Franklin
confined herself with the utmost strictness to the ceremonial
duties of her position, she could not have concealed the fact of
her bright intelligence, of her keen interest in social
questions, and of her eager desire for information on all
colonial matters. Still less would her husband have consented to
disguise his high opinion of her judgment or his readiness to
consult it. It would always have been known, or at any rate
suspected, and by persons who would not hesitate to treat
suspicion as knowledge, that she shared the Governor's counsels;
and those who desired, as more than one of the colonial officials
did desire, to embarrass or to wound their chief by representing
her influence as supreme, would have had little difficulty in
finding or inventing evidence on which to found the charge.</p>
<p>That charge is, in truth, one of the most embarrassing, not to
say the most offensive, which can be brought against either of
the two parties who are its object. To say of any person in high
authority that his policy is dictated by his wife, is to level at
him an imputation to which he cannot submit without confession of
weakness and incapacity, yet which a man of generosity finds it
impossible to repel with the indignation which, had he only
himself to consider, he would probably display. Franklin was far
too magnanimous to throw his denial into such a form as might
imply that he excluded Lady Franklin from all participation in
his public cares, while she herself must have suffered acutely in
feeling that this magnanimity necessarily weakened him for
defence. Nay, she was no doubt conscious that she had in fact
endeavoured, within the limits of legitimate persuasion, to
impress her own views of certain social questions upon her
husband's mind; while her concurrent consciousness that she had
never exceeded these limits, and, indeed, that beyond them she
would have been powerless to deflect the course of Franklin's
policy, made the misrepresentations of the malicious peculiarly
hard to bear. We have already seen how improper a use had been
made of her name, though in that case, doubtless, with no
unworthy purpose, by Captain Mackonochie, and how stern a rebuke
he had provoked from the Governor in consequence. Lady Franklin
was guiltless of anything save an abstract sympathy with the
private secretary's ultra-humanitarian views as a reformer of
prison discipline, an unfeigned esteem for his personal
character, and a feeling of tenderness for a family who were in
some sense her guests, and who had at any rate lived for months
with her in the intimacy of a common household. It was in
response to these sentiments, and to these alone, that she had
laboured to prevent the final rupture between him and her
husband, and had used her good offices at an earlier stage of
their intercourse to soothe those natural feelings of resentment
which Mackonochie's singular disregard of the obligations of his
confidential post had created in Franklin's mind. Yet she had had
reason to repent even this act of simple friendliness, and she
was fated to learn that conduct of equally innocent motive could
be even more unwarrantably perverted.</p>
<p>Franklin, it is true, was to have no more trouble from private
secretaries. Captain Mackonochie was succeeded by Mr. (afterwards
Sir) Henry Elliot, then only just commencing the distinguished
career which he was afterwards to pursue through various
diplomatic offices to that important post of Ambassador at
Constantinople, which he served with such marked and memorable
ability in the Eastern crisis of 1876-77. Between Elliot and the
Franklins relations of the highest mutual esteem and confidence
at once established themselves, and were not long in developing
into those of close personal attachment. Nor did the intimacy
cease with the private secretary's relinquishment of his office a
couple of years later and his return to England to enter the
diplomatic service. A correspondence was for some time maintained
by him with his former chief, to whose character and capacity he
took occasion many years later to bear a testimony which will be
cited in a later page of this volume.</p>
<p>But trouble was brewing for the Governor elsewhere, and in
more quarters than one. Reference has been already made to the
singular and almost ludicrous acrimony of the quarrels which
raged from time to time in the official circle of the colony. The
gentleman who then filled the office of Attorney-General had come
into violent collision with one of the judges a short time after
Franklin's arrival. He was said to have 'eaten sandwiches' in the
judicial presence, to the derogation or delay of the proceedings;
and the judge, among other words of reproof, had thus addressed
him: 'Sir, in your official capacity I shall always treat you
with the courtesy and respect due to you. Were you elsewhere I
should treat you, after your conduct, with less courtesy than a
dog.' The difficulty was settled by the transfer of the
Attorney-General to another colony, but his successor failed to
hit it off with his colleagues, and later on the legal business
of the Government was somewhat embarrassed by the circumstance of
its two law officers not being on speaking terms with each other.
In the legislative session of 1839 the superior of these two
functionaries felt it his duty to oppose one of the measures
brought forward by the Governor, the principle of which had been
also denounced by the Solicitor-General as 'iniquitous and
unprecedented'; but upon the resignation of the Attorney-General
his colleague accepted his place and voted for the Bill. His
defence of this conduct was that he had expressed the former
opinion in ignorance of its details; but so much public
indignation was excited by his remarkable change of front that
Mr. Solicitor himself soon deemed it expedient to follow Mr.
Attorney into retirement, and both officials had to be replaced
by successors.</p>
<p>A difficulty, however, of a still graver nature awaited
Franklin in connection with this measure, the principle of which,
it must be admitted, was legitimately open to dispute. The Bill
was supplemental to another which had just previously passed the
Council for prohibiting private distillation, and which had
included a provision for the compensation of the distillers at an
amount to be settled by a committee. To this mode of settlement
the Chief Justice, as was perhaps natural, took strong objection;
and the Government, being, on the other hand, unwilling to accede
to his proposal that the claims of the distillers should be
referred to a jury, yet anxious that the enactment should not be
delayed, had passed it with a substituted section simply
affirming the general principle that compensation should be paid.
To apply this principle, however, to the actual circumstances of
the case turned out to be no easy matter. The laxity of the
distillation laws had enabled the manufacturers in many instances
to realise illicit profits by paying duties on a lower
denomination of cereals than those actually employed by them in
their trade. Their past gains could not of course be questioned,
but Franklin strenuously and reasonably objected to allow the
rate of compensation to be based on a rate of profits which had
been only maintainable by defrauding the revenue. So far, no
doubt, he carried all his colleagues with him; it was on his
proposed method of giving legislative effect to his views that
differences arose. A resolution was introduced to the effect
'that any applicant having been proved, to the satisfaction of
this Council, to have been in the habit of distilling contrary to
law, has by such practice destroyed any claim he might have
otherwise had to compensation.' This resolution, perhaps because
it was only a resolution, passed the Council. When, however, it
was followed by what was called a Feigned Issues Bill&mdash;that
is to say, a measure providing, by means of an action at law
between two hypothetical litigants, for the judicial
determination of the question whether any individual distiller
applying for compensation had or had not increased his profits by
the illicit practices above mentioned&mdash;Franklin failed to
carry his colleagues with him. The lawyers on the Council,
together with all the non-official members, opposed it, and the
Bill was ultimately lost.</p>
<p>It was, however, opposed also by a member of the Council who
was neither legal nor unofficial, but was in fact as closely
concerned in the financial administration of the colony as the
Governor himself. This was Mr. Gregory, the colonial treasurer,
whose conflict with his chief on this question soon reached an
acute stage. It could hardly, indeed, have been otherwise; and
the only matter for surprise in the whole business is the
apparent assumption of the dissentient minister that his official
position, after his difference with the Governor had proved to be
an irreconcilable one, was for a moment tenable at all. The
policy or even the equity of Franklin's proposed measure was not
the question. There is undoubtedly a good deal to be said for the
objectors, whose contention presumably was that, though a
distiller's past violations of fiscal law might properly and
indeed ought obviously to be taken into account against him in
assessing his losses by the extinction of his trade, they did not
and could not justify the Government in fining him to the extent
of the whole profits, lawful as well as unlawful, which that
trade had brought him in. But the merits or demerits of the
measure no more affected the question as between Franklin and
Gregory than it would have affected similar questions arising in
the mother country between a Prime Minister and a member of his
Cabinet. In each case the duty of such a member, either to
support the policy of his chief or to resign his office, would be
plain; and probably nothing but the personal animus which seems
to have been engendered by every official difference of opinion
in Tasmania prevented Mr. Gregory from seeing this. Franklin's
rough manuscript memoranda of his various interviews with the
Colonial Treasurer are still in existence, and they show
conclusively enough that he spared no pains to dissuade that
officer from taking up a position of active hostility to the
policy of his chief. It would even appear that the Governor, on
the advice of his Executive Council, went the somewhat illogical
length of acquiescing in Mr. Gregory's opposition to the Bill,
provided that he would be content to confine that opposition to a
silent vote, and would refrain from addressing the Council
against the Bill.</p>
<p>All these efforts were, however, vain, and Franklin at last
conceived it to be his imperative duty to suspend the Treasurer
from his office, and to report the case and his action upon it to
the authorities in Downing Street, by whom it was, apparently
after some hesitation, approved. They could hardly of course have
done otherwise under the circumstances. Franklin's case was too
good in the merits for that. Still it is, I think, evident that
the authorities in Downing Street were a little taken aback by
the vigour of his action, and that they would have preferred his
proceeding by the more leisurely and ceremonious method of
suspending the legislation, first, and the hostile official only
after reference to and permission from the department.</p>
<p>The Colonial Secretary, Mr. Montagu, was an antagonist of a
different and more formidable kind. He was a man of marked
administrative ability, engaging manners, and a considerable gift
of persuasive speech; but his disposition was masterful and
ambitious, and he was quick to resent any slight to his dignity
or any check to his influence as the officer next in colonial
rank to the Governor. That he would eventually come into conflict
with Franklin was certain; the wonder is that the collision was
delayed so long. What seems to have precipitated, or to have
helped to precipitate it, was a visit paid by Mr. Montagu to
England. His leave of absence was granted to him on private
grounds, but his chief, whose unqualified confidence he then
possessed, was of opinion that his presence in England 'might be
of infinite advantage to the colony if he had legitimate access
to the Colonial Office, and had means of making available his
knowledge and experience in colonial affairs, and especially on
the subjects of emigration and convict discipline.'</p>
<p>The result, however, was disappointing. It was said by Mr.
Montagu's friends in the colony, and the admissions of his
brother-in-law and <i>locum tenens</i>, Captain Forster, lent
credit to the statement, that he did not intend to return to
Tasmania at all unless he failed to obtain a certain appointment
elsewhere, of which he was ambitious, and which he had gone to
England to seek. All this time, however, Franklin was receiving
from him most positive announcements of his intention to return.
This, and the fact that Mr. Montagu continued to keep his
relative informed of his interviews with and advice to the
Secretary of State on the contemplated changes in the convict
system, while he withheld all information on these points from
the Governor, tended to produce a certain strain in the relations
between them; and though, on his return to the colony in the
summer of 1841, Franklin attempted, 'after some necessary
explanations', to re-establish the old footing of cordiality, it
seems clear enough that the attempt was but imperfectly
successful.</p>
<p>About six months later the crisis came. Franklin had removed
from the post of district surgeon (which included the medical
charge of prisoners within certain limits) a young man who was
represented to him as having carelessly and inhumanly neglected
his duty in a particular case. The principal medical officer
recommended that he should be severely reprimanded. The Colonial
Secretary, through whom the report came to the Governor, added
the recommendation that he should be dismissed. After examining
the papers, Franklin concurred in the advice offered him, and
annotated the documents with some severe animadversions on the
surgeon's conduct. Facts, however, which were subsequently
brought to his knowledge convinced him that he had acted with
some precipitancy, and, 'not having yet learnt', as he afterwards
characteristically observed, 'that it is a greater blunder in a
ruler to repair than commit an error', it was a relief to his
mind to receive a memorial from some of the most respectable
inhabitants of the district in question&mdash;headed by the very
foreman of the coroner's jury, who had previously passed some
severe strictures on the surgeon's conduct&mdash;expressing the
sense entertained by the neighbours and friends of Dr. Coverdale
of his general humanity and skill, and their desire to retain his
professional services. To the revision of the original sentence
Mr. Montagu offered the most strenuous opposition. He pressed his
chief to withhold his reply to the memorial until he had read and
considered a memorandum which the Colonial Secretary desired to
address to him on the subject. With this request Franklin, of
course, complied, but when on receiving this paper he found Mr.
Montagu's arguments insufficient, and, moreover, founded in part
on mistaken data, he adhered to his decision, of which Montagu
had, as usual, to be the official organ of conveyance. It was
this reversal of a decision recommended by him which brought
about the rupture.</p>
<p>After absenting himself for several days and sending his
papers to the Governor without note or comment, contrary to his
usual custom, Franklin found it necessary to send for him on
business which was to be transacted in the Legislative Council.
At the close of this interview Montagu in a very deliberate and
formal manner declared that evil consequences would ensue from
the step which had been taken with respect to Dr. Coverdale; that
great excitement prevailed in the district of Richmond; that the
petition was an entirely political movement; that he knew how it
was 'got up;' that Dr. Coverdale's punishment was stated to be
his (Montagu's) act, and that to restore him was to degrade his
(the Colonial Secretary's) office; and, most important
notification of all, as the event proved, that Franklin 'must not
in future expect the same assistance he had hitherto rendered,
though he should keep within the line of his official duty', and
that he 'feared that Franklin's official labours would thus be
greatly augmented.' He concluded by expressing a hope that the
evil consequences which he apprehended might not take place.</p>
<p>Franklin replied in effect that he shared the hope, and united
to it the expectation, that they would not; that he knew nothing
of any agitation whatever in the Richmond district, nor why there
should be any; that he neither knew nor cared whether the
petition was 'got up' as alleged or not; that he saw no reason
why Mr. Montagu's office should be 'degraded', or his usefulness
diminished, or his chief's labours increased; but if that were to
be the case, that he hoped he should be able to bear it. 'My
reply', continued Franklin in the subsequently published
'Narrative', from which I have been quoting, 'might certainly
have been couched in less forbearing terms, but, hoping that Mr.
Montagu was labouring under some delusion and would soon see the
folly and impropriety of these idle and disrespectful
observations, I treated the subject as an ebullition of personal
feeling of which he would soon himself be ashamed. Mr. Montagu's,
however, were no idle threats. From that day, or more correctly
speaking, perhaps, from the day when he reluctantly transmitted
my answer to the petition, the current business of my office
assumed a very different aspect. Mr. Montagu absented himself as
much as he could from personal attendance; the papers he
forwarded to me were no longer accompanied by the necessary
information which had to be elicited step by step from the
Colonial Secretary's office; needless questions were referred to
me; every effort was made to overwhelm me if possible with the
investigation of minute details, and to make me feel that my
dependence on Mr. Montagu's ordinary services was not to be
broken with impunity.'</p>
<p>Matters, in fact, had by this time reached a stage at which
any man of a colder and more calculating nature than Franklin's
would have seen that a choice between two courses was open to
him. Confronted as he found himself by a hostile and indeed
secretly mutinous subordinate, with whom further official
co-operation was impossible, such a Governor would either have
reported the whole affair to Downing Street and requested the
authorities to transfer his secretary to some other post; or, if
he found the situation created by Montagu so intolerable that his
summary dismissal or suspension was imperatively called for
without awaiting the sanction of the Colonial Office to the step,
he would at least have taken care to provide himself with a good
<i>casus belli</i> by putting his refractory minister in some
definite official issue conspicuously in the wrong.</p>
<p>Franklin took neither of these courses, or at least adhered to
neither. He tried forbearance without forbearing long enough; and
when he at last took action he injudiciously permitted a
complaint of an unofficial, or, at any rate, of a not strictly
official character against Montagu to be mixed up with the cause
of dissatisfaction which already existed. And, gravest imprudence
of all, this complaint was founded upon the always doubtful and
generally quite unprovable charge of having countenanced
anonymous attacks in a newspaper. The 'Van Diemen's Land
Chronicle' began to publish articles reflecting, in the offensive
tone characteristic of the colonial press of those days, on the
conduct of the Governor, and generally supporting the Montagu
side in the quarrel; and the 'Van Diemen's Land Chronicle' was a
recently founded newspaper, for which on its establishment the
Colonial Secretary had undoubtedly solicited Government
patronage. Its editor and some of its principal writers were
known to be his personal friends. On the appearance in its
columns, therefore, of these attacks, it began to be said by the
Franklin party that the Colonial Secretary was 'using the
newspaper directly or indirectly to abuse and degrade the
Lieutenant-Governor and his family.' It is a question, perhaps,
whether it would have been wise even for Franklin himself to call
Montagu's attention to these reports: it was certainly not
advisable that such a step should be taken by any third person
acting on his own initiative. Sir John's then private secretary,
who seems to have been a gentleman of considerable officiousness
and a somewhat plentiful lack of discretion, wrote on his own
account, and premising that he had no authority from his chief,
to invite from Montagu a denial of these imputations. The
Colonial Secretary 'first evaded any direct reply', and then (and
it must be owned not unnaturally) 'expressed his resentment at
the interference.'</p>
<p>This correspondence took place during a few days of Franklin's
absence from the seat of government. On his return it was laid
before him by Mr. Henslowe, when no doubt the most judicious mode
of dealing with it would have been to lay it quietly on one side,
and perhaps at the same time to administer a gentle rebuke to the
private secretary for his excess of zeal. Franklin, however, as
has been already stated, was somewhat over-sensitive, and his
wife even more so, to newspaper abuse, and, 'the Colonial
Secretary having taken no steps to repudiate the insinuations
referred to in the correspondence', he deemed it impossible any
longer to overlook or delay notice of the very singular position
in which Mr. Montagu appeared to have placed himself. He
accordingly addressed a memorandum to Montagu reminding him of
the conversation in which he had solicited, or had, at any rate,
been understood by his chief to solicit, Government patronage for
the 'Van Diemen's Land Chronicle', calling attention to the
scurrilous articles against the Governor and his family which had
appeared in its columns during the last month, and inquiring
whether the Colonial Secretary had 'taken any steps to uphold
under such circumstances the dignity of my Government.'</p>
<p>To Franklin's great astonishment, Montagu informed him in
reply 'that he had no recollection whatever of anything I had
said respecting the newspaper', except that he (Montagu) had
conveyed a request from the editor that Lady Franklin would send
him for editorial purposes the literary and other periodicals she
was in the habit of receiving from England, and had further made
a voluntary communication to the Governor of the editor's
intention to support the Government in his newspaper.
Consequently, Montagu went on to say, it was entirely out of his
power to 'withdraw assistance he had never given', or to 'assist
the dignity of the Government' by any step of the kind suggested.
And, to trace the disagreeable affair to its close, as described
in the words of Franklin's 'Narrative':</p>
<blockquote>The climax of Mr. Montagu's language in the
correspondence which passed on this subject was contained in the
following insulting remark in his letter of January 17: 'But I
trust your Excellency will also pardon me for submitting to
you&mdash;and I beg to assure you that I do so under a deep
conviction of the necessity of supporting my statement&mdash;that
while your Excellency and all the members of your Government have
had such frequent opportunities of testing my memory as to have
acquired for it the reputation of a remarkably accurate one, your
officers have not been without opportunity of learning that your
Excellency could not always place implicit reliance upon your
own.'<br>
<br>
Unwilling to bandy more words with Mr. Montagu, I paused on the
receipt of the letter, and, having again patiently reviewed the
events of the last few months, and considered the little prospect
there was of any real and healthy confidence being re-established
between us, I felt that without detriment to the public service
and dishonour to myself I could not retain Mr. Montagu as
Colonial Secretary, and accordingly used the powers vested in me
of suspending him from office until Her Majesty's pleasure should
be known. This determination I conveyed to Mr. Montagu on January
25, 1842, exactly three months after his announcement of his
intention to withhold the assistance he had previously rendered
to me as Governor.</blockquote>
<p>The 'insulting imputation', as Franklin, not without reason,
describes it, was the worst blunder Montagu had made, and with
his usual acuteness he saw the necessity of hastening to repair
it.</p>
<p>On the eve of the day named by himself for handing over the
business of his office to his successor, and six days after his
suspension had been made known to him, he apologised for the
expression above quoted, which he begged to withdraw, and
disavowed any intention of disrespect. Franklin conveyed to him
his appreciation and acceptance of this apology, but, his
decision having been formed on public grounds and on the whole of
Montagu's conduct, he felt that he could not reverse it for an
act of tardy reparation addressed especially to his personal
feelings. 'This act of Mr. Montagu's enabled me, however,' he
adds, 'to inform him of my intention to recommend him to the
Secretary of State for employment as an able and experienced
officer whose services might be useful to the Crown in any
country but in Van Diemen's Land. The Secretary of State',
continues Franklin, 'is well aware how amply I redeemed this
pledge.'</p>
<p>So amply indeed, and with such effect, did he redeem it, that
Mr. Montagu, as will be seen, obtained immediate transfer to an
official post of equal if not of higher rank and emolument; but
the giving of such a pledge must nevertheless be regarded as a
generous error. Mr. Montagu's 'ability' and 'experience' were
unquestioned; but it was another matter to say of an officer who
had for the past three months been executing his threat of
withholding from his chief 'the assistance he had hitherto
rendered him', that 'his services might be useful to the Crown in
any country but in Van Diemen's Land.' They might or they might
not be, according as he got on or not with his official superior.
Franklin's own case against him was that under existing
circumstances Mr. Montagu was so much the reverse of 'useful'
that he felt it impossible, without 'detriment to the service' of
the Crown and 'dishonour to its representative', to retain him as
Colonial Secretary. To admit his usefulness 'in any country but
in Van Diemen's Land' was equivalent&mdash;or was sure to be
understood as equivalent&mdash;to an admission that the
individuality and personal characteristics of the Governor had
something to do with the Secretary's contumacy. It would, in
fact, have been only too easy for an unfriendly criticism to
attribute it to a conscience-stricken acknowledgment on the part
of the chief that he had dealt too harshly with his subordinate,
and to a desire to make him such amends as lay in his power by
recommending him for official employment elsewhere.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>
<p align="center">FRANKLIN AND DOWNING STREET<br>
<br>
1842-1844</p>
<p><small>MR. MONTAGU</small> was not the man to accept dismissal
from any official post in a meekly submissive spirit. He had
influential friends in England, and, as he believed, the ear of
the Colonial Office, and he at once made his preparations for an
energetic appeal against Franklin's decision. He lost no time in
leaving for home, in order to plead his own cause on the spot,
and, by the same ship which took him to England the Governor
addressed his despatches to the Secretary of State for the
Colonies announcing the suspension of his officer, and giving a
detailed account of the incidents which had led to it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the quarrel, as often happens in such cases, had
become complicated with and embittered by other and irrelevant
topics of dispute. Lady Franklin's name had been drawn into it,
Mr. Montagu asserting that it was she who had attempted to
agitate or had, at any rate, favoured the agitation of the
Richmond district, in favour of the medical officer whose
reinstatement had led to the breach between the Governor and the
Colonial Secretary. The charge was, of course, indignantly
repudiated by Lady Franklin, and no doubt was destitute of any
other basis than local gossip seizing upon private expressions,
not always withheld perhaps from unsuitable audiences, of her
sympathy with a young man who had been treated with undue
severity Mr. Montagu, however, persisted in and doubtless
believed the imputation; it was taken up, <i>more suo</i>, by his
partisans in the colonial press, and for both husband and wife it
constituted, as may well be imagined, the most painful part of
the affair.</p>
<p>Another and minor difference arose between the suspended
Secretary and his chief on conflicting allegations of fact. The
Director of Public Works had been censured by Franklin for having
without his authority engaged in very costly improvements of a
church for which the Governor had sanctioned only some necessary
and simple alterations. Captain Cheyne, the officer thus rebuked,
pleaded Mr. Montagu's sanction. Mr. Montagu denied that he had
given it, and declared that he had 'never seen' the authority on
which the Director had commenced the work. After his departure
for England the plans were found and shown to have been approved
and signed by the late Colonial Secretary. There is no reason to
suspect him of anything worse than a lapse of memory; but when
two men are at daggers drawn mutual suspicions are easily
excited, and Franklin despatched these plans and the details of
the incidents connected with them to the Colonial Office, as a
separate head of complaint against his suspended subordinate.</p>
<p>The contest between them, however, was an unequal one. Montagu
was on the spot, that is to say, in Downing Street, Franklin
thousands of miles away. The latter was personally unknown to the
higher official staff of the Colonial Department; the former had
but recently been conferring with them on colonial matters, and
had produced upon them that favourable impression as to his
personal abilities which no man knew better how to create. And
lastly, in the minister at the head of the Department Mr. Montagu
had the good fortune to find a statesman whose brilliant
political powers blinded and still to some extent blind the
public to those grave defects of character with which his
intimates had too good reason to be acquainted. He was not at all
the sort of minister who, if he happened at a first impression to
form a strong view of the merits of a particular case, would be
at all likely to reconsider it on any grounds of conscientious
scruple or from any sense of judicial duty. Nor was it in his
haughty and imperious temper to consider the feelings of others
as to his mode of signifying the conclusions at which he might
have arrived. Lord Stanley, as it happened, took a very strong
view of the Franklin-Montagu dispute in Mr. Montagu's favour, and
this view found ultimate embodiment in a despatch which was not
only in itself so remarkable a document, but received so large an
addition to its importance from the truly extraordinary
circumstances of its promulgation, that it will be necessary to
quote it entire. It is dated from Downing Street, September 13,
1842, nearly eight months after Mr. Montagu's suspension, and is
in these words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Sir,&mdash;I have received the series of despatches
enumerated in the margin, reporting the various occurrences which
led to the suspension from office of Mr. Montagu, the Colonial
Secretary of Van Diemen's Land, and to the arrival of that
gentleman in this country.<br>
<br>
This voluminous mass of papers has occupied much of my time, and
has engaged my deliberate attention. In proceeding to announce to
you the decision at which I have arrived I shall not attempt to
enter with any minuteness into the various details and
circumstances of the transactions to which they refer.
Unfortunately, the merits of the question are so much darkened by
the redundancy of the discussions in which it has been involved
that any addition to their length and number would increase
rather than dissipate the obscurity. I shall, therefore, confine
myself to a brief recapitulation of the charge preferred against
Mr. Montagu, and to a statement of the conclusions which I have
adopted respecting each of them first. You have represented in
substance (I purposely abstain from the quotation of the pages
over which the complaint is spared) that Mr. Montagu had acquired
an influence and authority in the affairs of your Government far
exceeding that which properly belonged to his office; that this
influence was maintained by means which, if not culpable, were at
least objectionable, and was used in such a manner as to render
his continued employment incompatible with the freedom and
independence of action which the Lieutenant-Governor ought to
maintain.<br>
<br>
I am not disposed to controvert, but rather to adopt, your
opinion that various circumstances had concurred to place in the
hands of Mr. Montagu a degree of authority which, if not balanced
by great energy and decision in his immediate superiors, would
probably tend to invert the relation which ought to subsist
between them. But I find no reason to impute to Mr. Montagu the
blame of having acquired the power by any unworthy means or
dishonest acts; or of having employed it for any sinister purpose
or in an unbecoming spirit.<br>
<br>
2nd. It is represented that when you overruled Mr. Montagu's
advice in the case of Dr. Coverdale, Mr. Montagu manifested his
discontent by words, and by a course of conduct unbefitting his
position and yours, disrespectfully intimating that the zeal
which he had till then exhibited in the performance of his duty
would be relaxed; and carrying that intimation into effect under
such circumstances as to justify the belief that it was his
design to embarrass you by suddenly exposing you to what he
esteemed insuperable difficulties.<br>
<br>
I am not able entirely to acquit Mr. Montagu of having, in
reference to Dr. Coverdale's case, employed some language which
you not unnaturally regarded as a menace or of having ceased to
render you his efficient services in the same cordial and zealous
spirit which till then he had been accustomed to evince towards
you. It may be difficult to condemn a public servant who
faithfully and ably performs whatever lies within the strict
range of his duty for not advancing further and yielding the aid
which public spirit would prompt, or which a stronger personal
regard for his employer would suggest. But the abrupt abandonment
of a cordial co-operation for a service confined within the exact
limits of positive duty may be the subject of a legitimate
reproach, and from this reproach Mr. Montagu is not, I think,
altogether to be exempted.<br>
<br>
3rd. Mr. Montagu is charged with having made an improper use, in
the course of these proceedings, of the name of a lady the most
intimately allied to yourself.<br>
<br>
I pass as rapidly as possible from such a topic, confining myself
to the single remark that the imputation does not appear to me to
be well founded.<br>
<br>
4th. The next ground of accusation is Mr. Montagu's neglect to
take proper notice of articles insulting to yourself and your
family which appeared in a newspaper established under his
auspices, and for which he had obtained your patronage, and his
having, by his conduct, given countenance to the opinion that he
had some personal connection with these injurious paragraphs.<br>
<br>
After fully weighing every part of this case, I entirely acquit
Mr. Montagu of all connection with the offensive articles in
question, or with the authors of them, or of having omitted to do
anything which from his position in reference to yourself and
your Government might reasonably have been expected of him to
prevent and discourage them.<br>
<br>
5th. You complain of the language addressed by Mr. Montagu to
your private secretary and to yourself on the subject of these
newspaper paragraphs as having been wanting in the respect which
ft was his duty to observe towards you, and as having in one
instance conveyed an insulting imputation on your
credibility.<br>
<br>
On this part of the case also I think that Mr. Montagu is
entitled to be entirely acquitted of blame. He did indeed make
use of an inadvertent expression in one of his letters to you,
but the frankness and earnestness with which the error was
acknowledged, and with which your forgiveness was solicited, seem
to me to have been an ample atonement for an unfortunate
selection of words; for such, and not any intentional insult, was
the real character of the offence.<br>
<br>
6th. It is imputed to Mr. Montagu that he made an improper appeal
against your suspension of him to the public at large through the
local newspapers at the very moment when he was contemplating a
return to this country to prefer his appeal to myself.<br>
<br>
I think that he has fully exculpated himself from this
accusation.<br>
<br>
Finally, you represent that Mr. Montagu authorised the
expenditure of large sums of public money in erecting the tower
and spire of a church, not merely without your authority, but
with a studious intention of keeping you in the dark on the
subject.<br>
<br>
Here again I think that Mr. Montagu is entitled to be completely
absolved of the fault imputed to him. He had no notice of the
charge before leaving Van Diemen's Land, but he has since
repelled it to my entire satisfaction.<br>
<br>
The result of my consideration of the whole subject is, as you
will see, to relieve Mr. Montagu from every censure which impugns
the integrity or the propriety of his conduct, while I am
compelled to admit that the circumstances of the case are such as
to render his restoration to his office in Van Diemen's Land
highly inexpedient. It was, therefore, gratifying to me to have
it in my power to offer him an equivalent which, while it would
mark my undiminished confidence in his disposition and ability to
render effective public service, would direct his talents to a
field of labour in which they could be exerted without the
inconvenience which must attend his resumption of his duties as
Colonial Secretary at Van Diemen's Land.<br>
<br>
I offered for his acceptance the vacant office of Colonial
Secretary at the Cape of Good Hope, and he has cheerfully
accepted it. It cannot be too distinctly understood that Mr.
Montagu retires from the situation he has so long filled with his
public and personal character unimpaired, and with his hold on
the respect and confidence of Her Majesty's Government
undiminished.<br>
<br>
Mr. Bicheno has been appointed to succeed Mr. Montagu at Van
Diemen's Land, and his arrival may be expected shortly after your
receipt of this despatch.<br>
<br>
I am not aware it could answer any useful purpose to enter more
fully into the merits of this protracted controversy. But,
reluctant as I am to employ a single expression which is likely
to be unwelcome to you, I am compelled to add that your
proceedings in this case of Mr. Montagu do not appear to me to
have been well judged, and that your suspension of him from
office is not, in my opinion, sufficiently
vindicated.</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="center">I have the honour to be, Sir,</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">Your most obedient humble
servant,            <br>
<small>STANLEY</small>.   </p>
<p>A despatch of such uncompromising not to say brutal severity
can seldom have been addressed by a Cabinet Minister to a
Colonial Governor; but the harshness of its terms is not more
conspicuous than its signally unjudicial spirit. That Lord
Stanley arrived at a conclusion adverse to the Governor and
declined to approve his action, no reasonable supporter of
Franklin could perhaps have complained. The point was distinctly
an arguable one, and a Minister might in perfect good faith and
with fullest deliberation have held that, the Governor having
overlooked or condoned the Secretary's extraordinary intimation
of his intention to reduce the amount of assistance his chief
might expect from him, no adequate cause for his suspension had
subsequently arisen. But Lord Stanley was not content with
pointing out the insufficiency of the grounds on which the
Secretary was actually suspended; he went out of his way to
extenuate conduct on the Secretary's part which would have been
amply sufficient to justify any Governor in suspending him.</p>
<p>His observations on this are almost absurdly lenient. Thus: 'I
am not able entirely to acquit Mr. Montagu of having used
language which you not unnaturally regarded as' (it would have
been highly unnatural to regard it as anything else than) 'a
menace.' And again: 'It may be difficult to condemn a public
servant' for not going beyond the line of strict official duty;
but 'the abrupt abandonment of a cordial co-operation for a
service confined within the exact limits of positive duty may be
'(not, as one might expect to read, the cause of a total
disorganisation of the work of the Government, or a possible
administrative collapse, but merely, and mildly)' 'the subject of
a legitimate reproach.' Surely the real question was not so much
as to the propriety of 'cordial co-operation' or the
inconvenience of its 'abrupt abandonment', but as to the meaning
and effect of a formal notice on the part of an officer who
hitherto had cordially co-operated with his chief that he
intended to do so no longer. It is impossible to draw any such
hard-and-fast line between the course of conduct demanded by
public duty and that which is suggested by private goodwill as
Lord Stanley assumed; and a Colonial Secretary who deliberately
warns a Colonial Governor that he no longer intends to pursue the
latter course of conduct is likely sooner or later to deviate
from the former. There can, at any rate, be little doubt as to
the action which would have been taken by any man of less
forbearing or of a more coldly calculating temper than Franklin
on receiving a formal notice from a subordinate that his services
would in future be unwillingly instead of ungrudgingly performed.
Such a man would immediately have called upon his lieutenant for
explanation or withdrawal, and, failing this, would have pointed
out to him that if his sentiments towards his chief had really
become such as to preclude him from co-operating with him as
cordially as heretofore, it was his manifest duty to resign.</p>
<p>Lord Stanley's prepossession, however, in favour of the
subordinate officer is conspicuous in every paragraph of the
despatch. He may have been right in disregarding a complaint so
indefinite as that Montagu had 'acquired an influence and
authority' in excess of that 'which properly belonged to his
office', and he may have been justified in acquitting him of
having acquired this power by 'any unworthy means or dishonest
acts, or having employed it for any sinister purpose or in an
unbecoming spirit.' But it was gratuitously offensive on Lord
Stanley's part to suggest, as he quite distinctly does, that the
Colonial Secretary encroached upon the authority of the Governor
because he was the stronger man of the two. Nor, considering the
person to whom the despatch was nominally addressed, do the
elaborate testimonial to Mr. Montagu's high official qualities
and the emphatic assurance of Her Majesty's Government's
undiminished confidence in him with which the Secretary of State
concludes appear particularly well placed. As addressed to his
late chief it is hardly explicable, except on the assumption of a
deliberate intent to humiliate the Governor by whom this warmly
eulogised official had been suspended.</p>
<p>But it was in truth only nominally that the despatch was
addressed to Franklin at all. It might just as well have been
sent as an enclosure in a covering letter to Mr. Montagu; for,
incredible as it may seem, its contents were not only made known
to that gentleman, but had been freely circulated by him among
his friends in the colony months before they came to the
Governor's knowledge. 'The ink', as Franklin puts it in the
'Narrative', was 'scarcely dry on his Lordship's despatch before
its import was mentioned by a relative of Mr. Montagu's in the
hall of the Admiralty; it was sent to Mr. Montagu, who, it will
be recollected, was then on the spot, four days after its date,
unaccompanied by any injunction of privacy, but, on the contrary,
bearing on it the stamp of being Mr. Montagu's own authorised
property, to be used as he thought proper.' The natural result of
handing a copy of it to him without any precautions, an act
eminently characteristic of Lord Stanley's haughty want of
consideration for the feelings and interests of others, was that
the recipient felt, as he afterwards wrote in formal vindication
of his conduct, that he had a right to show it to whom he
pleased. 'I imagined it was sent to me for that purpose, to
enable me to satisfy those who were aware of my suspension from
office that I had obtained a complete and honourable acquittal. I
did not hesitate to distribute many copies for that purpose in
England. . . . For the same reason I sent two copies to Van
Diemen's Land&mdash;one to Mr. Forster, and one to Captain
Swanston. I requested them to show it to my friends and to those
who took an interest in my case; but I stipulated that no
newspaper was to have one word of the despatch communicated to
it.'</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, for official decency, the despatch
obtained nearly as much publicity as though it had been
circulated through the press. By some untoward mischance, which
was to repeat itself with even more serious consequences later
on, the Colonial Office proved slower in its communication with
Tasmania than did private correspondents. Documentary evidence
existed, Franklin declares, in his possession that Lord Stanley's
despatch was known to be in the colony before he himself received
it on January 18, 1843, and he had besides the testimony of a
resident at Port Phillip to its having been publicly read at a
dinner table in that colony, at any rate at a date prior to his
(Franklin's) own receipt of it. Immediately on its reaching the
Governor, the friends of Mr. Montagu threw aside even the very
slight reserve that they had maintained; and Mr. Swanston, the
late Colonial Secretary's agent and manager of the principal bank
in Hobart Town placed a copy of the despatch for general
inspection on his office table. Its contents became the leading
theme of every local newspaper, and were made the text for
commentaries abounding, as Franklin bitterly complained, in
'every species of vulgar insult.'</p>
<p>But the cup of indignity was not even yet full, nor had the
Secretary of State as yet exhausted his ingenuity in the
selection of inconsiderate and oppressive methods of performing
what should have been a painful duty. To a high-spirited man like
Franklin, the mere tenor of the despatch would in any case, and
apart from the needless affront inflicted upon him in the manner
of its communication, have appeared to suggest but one possible
course of action. 'On receipt of it,' he writes, 'I hastened to
request of Lord Stanley that he would lose no time in appointing
my successor, unless he was enabled to give me the assurance of
possessing what the despatch seemed to render so equivocal, the
continued confidence of Her Majesty's Government. But long before
this conditional resignation could reach England my successor was
on his voyage out', and, as will be afterwards seen, he arrived
in the colony four days before Franklin received the official
notice of his recall.</p>
<p>The vast absurdity of this last administrative blunder almost
dwarfs the monstrosity of the outrage. Lord Stanley did many
remarkable things in his life besides taking his famous political
'leap in the dark', but one may well doubt whether he ever
rivalled the feat of appointing a Colonial Governor to fill a
chair which had not yet been vacated. It was a 'supersession' of
the occupant in the strictest etymological sense&mdash;a
supersession in the sense in which the Archbishop of York
understood the word when in the famous mediaeval struggle between
the northern and southern archiepiscopates for precedence he
asserted his claim to the place of honour on the right of the
Sovereign by the direct method of seating himself in his brother
of Canterbury's lap.</p>
<p>Sir Eardley Wilmot, the new Governor, a worthy country squire
and excellent chairman of quarter sessions, was the last man in
the world to covet the aggressive role of the Archbishop of York,
and was probably much more distressed by the consequences of this
gross departmental blundering than Franklin himself. He had come
out in the Cressy, convict ship, the captain of which, as though
entering into the spirit of these irregular proceedings, missed
the entrance to the port and landed him 'on an unfrequented part
of the coast' This was on the evening of August 17. On the
following night he entered Hobart Town, but he brought with him
no communication from Lord Stanley as to his appointment, nor any
official explanation of his arrival. On the 20th of the month,
however, the Gilmore, convict ship, arrived, with the duplicate
of a despatch from the Secretary of State announcing to Franklin
the appointment of a successor in the government of the colony;
and on the following day he received by the Eamont, merchantman,
the precious original itself, bearing date February 10. It had
been entrusted to a vessel described by Franklin in a subsequent
despatch to the Colonial Office as 'a notoriously slow sailer',
an expression the use of which, he afterwards admitted with his
usual good-humoured candour, was 'a weak point in his
remonstrance upon the unbecoming mode of his recall, as it
certainly savoured more of the captain than of the governor.' The
vessel in this case had been obliged by stress of weather to put
back, and had been detained for no less than six weeks in
Ireland. No care, however, was taken to send on the duplicate of
the despatch by any of the intermediate sailings prior to the
departure of the Gilmore, and in any case to appoint a new
Governor within a fortnight of the date of the despatch
announcing his predecessor's recall, and to allow only a few
weeks at the utmost to the former for winding up his public and
private business in the colony, was a gratuitous experiment in
the art of 'running things fine' which well deserved to meet with
the discreditable fiasco in which it resulted.</p>
<p>The recall despatch was of the following strictly official
tenor, its precise and methodical arrangement of dates presenting
rather a ridiculous appearance in the light of subsequent events.
'Sir,' wrote the Secretary of State,</p>
<blockquote>as your administration of the government of Van
Diemen's Land will at the time of your receipt of the despatch
have continued for more than six successive years, and as after
the lapse of that period the general regulations of the public
service will probably have induced you to anticipate the
appointment of a successor, I trust that I shall not subject you
to any serious inconvenience by the announcement that such a
change may be shortly anticipated.<br>
<br>
I am not at present able to state with precision at what time
your successor in the government of Van Diemen's Land will sail
from this country to assume that office, but I think it most
probable that his departure will not be delayed for more than six
weeks or two months beyond the present time. The interval will, I
hope, be sufficiently long to enable you to make, with
satisfaction to yourself, all the domestic and official
arrangements incident to the transfer into other hands of the
office you at present occupy.</blockquote>
<p>The unseemly hurry in which the change of governors was at
last effected reflects no little discredit on the Colonial
Office, because Franklin's recall had, it seems, been resolved
upon when Montagu's successor, Mr. Bicheno, was despatched to
Tasmania in December 1842; it was indeed, in Franklin's belief, a
matter of notoriety in England at that time. Yet Mr. Bicheno was
the bearer to him of no communication, either official or
confidential, of the impending change. On the contrary, the new
Colonial Secretary brought out some important despatches
respecting the changes which Lord Stanley was about to introduce
into prison discipline. In these despatches Franklin was
addressed as the person who was at once to commence initiatory
steps for this purpose, and his zealous solicitude was bespoken,
or rather (apparently) assumed, for the due execution of the
duties confided to him. Lord Stanley subsequently explained his
proceedings in the matter as dictated by a desire that Franklin's
recall at the expiration of the usual term of colonial government
should not have the appearance of being connected with the
Secretary of State's disapproval of Mr. Montagu's removal. All,
then, that can be said is that Lord Stanley's measures did grave
injustice to his motives, and that they fully warranted Franklin
in declaring, as he did, that, having regard to the
embarrassments and humiliations which were inflicted upon him by
the course actually adopted, he considered that his 'immediate
recall would have been a much less injury.'</p>
<p>It was most unfortunate, too, that a Minister anxious to
divest his action of a punitive appearance should have omitted
the customary and indeed almost conventional expression of the
satisfaction of the Sovereign with the Governor's services. This
slight also was tardily and not too graciously apologised for,
but undoubtedly it afforded only too just provocation for
Franklin's bitter remark that the acknowledgments usually
conveyed from the Crown in such cases were, under all the
circumstances, scarcely perhaps to be expected. The Secretary of
State, he said, had already stated in the case of Mr. Montagu
that 'it could not be too distinctly understood' that that
officer 'retired from the situation he had so long filled with
his hold on the respect and confidence of Her Majesty's
Government undiminished', and, 'the inferior officer thus
complimented, what terms remained for the Governor?'</p>
<p>On the day when the original of this despatch
arrived&mdash;that is to say, four days after the disembarkation
of the incomplete Governor on the 'unfrequented part of the
coast'&mdash;he was in a position to take the oaths of office and
was duly sworn in. Franklin, however, was not yet, on his part,
in a position to turn out, but was obliged to remain still ten
days longer in Government House, unable, in spite of the
exertions of the utmost diligence, to remove his family and
dispose of his effects in a less time. During this period Sir
Eardley Wilmot resided with the Colonial Secretary, and paid a
visit to Launceston, where there was an official residence. At
its close Franklin shifted his quarters to the house of the
Brigade-Major, where he remained for another two months busily
occupied, until such time as the Rajah, in which he had engaged
his passage, could complete the lading of her cargo at Port
Phillip.</p>
<p>The intervening weeks were passed amid circumstances strangely
unlike those which usually attend the departure of a superseded
Governor. They were weeks of continuous leave-taking, and of
preparations spontaneously made by the colonists of all classes
for speeding Franklin in almost a triumphal fashion on his
homeward journey. Letters of respectful and cordial sympathy
poured in upon him from all sides. Addresses were presented to
him from the bishop and clergy of the new diocese of Tasmania,
from landholders and occupiers of land in various parts of the
colony, from popular bodies like the Mechanics' Institute of
Hobart Town, from scientific associations like the Royal Society
of Tasmania. Even the colonial press relented towards him, and
one enthusiastic editor expressed his wish 'that Sir John had
remained twenty years longer'. A brother officer of Franklin,
Captain Parker King, wrote to congratulate him in bluff sailorly
fashion on having stuck to his post. 'I was delighted that you
remained for your successor. All the blue-jackets have done so.
'Tis only the soldiers', adds this particular blue-jacket, 'who
have walked off, afraid of being lampooned and insulted after the
honour of government was taken off their shoulders. I was told
you wouldn't stay. I said you would, and I was right; and so were
you.' Even among those who took no side in the Franklin-Montagu
quarrel, or whose leanings may actually be supposed from their
position to be against the late Governor, many were shocked at
the extreme harshness of Lord Stanley's despatch. Lady Franklin,
in a letter to her sister, records a humorous utterance of Mr.
Bicheno on being shown in the Colonial Office a copy of the
despatch about to be sent to Sir John Franklin. Well might he
exclaim, 'Hallo! Is this the way you snub the Governor? What,
then, has a Colonial Secretary to expect?'</p>
<p>Franklin's final leave-taking of the colony was more like the
departure of a Governor summoned to receive some special honour
at the hands of the Crown than that of a censured and virtually
recalled official. On the afternoon of the day of the embarkation
a dense crowd lined the streets through which he had to pass to
the vessel. Every head uncovered when he issued from the house in
which he had been staying, and his progress on foot to the
water's edge was a veritable triumphal march. 'As their beloved
Governor passed from among them,' writes an eye-witness, in
language of which the sincerity speaks for itself, 'many could
recall to memory his goodness, his charity, his honest, firm
uprightness of purpose; and the recollection was now apparent
when his power had ceased, when their object was no longer the
Governor invested with the patronage and the panoply of office,
but the man.' And the same observer goes on to give a more minute
description of the scene:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Sir John was dressed in full uniform as a captain in
the Royal Navy, and wore the stars of the several orders which
have been conferred upon him for distinguished services rendered
to his country and the cause of scientific discovery. He halted
occasionally for an instant to acknowledge the enthusiastic
cheers which burst forth from the assembled multitude. The
procession was swelled by new arrivals at every step, the
cheering being renewed at intervals as the moving mass received
fresh accessions. Handkerchiefs were waved from verandahs and
open windows along the line of route, and there were few who felt
entirely unmoved at the scene before them, a loyal and generous
people paying a heartfelt tribute of affection to a truly good
man with whom their destinies had been bound up for
years.</blockquote>
<p>Near the point of embarkation a captain's guard of honour
(fifty men) had been stationed, soldiers of a famous British
regiment which had served through the Peninsular campaign and
bore the name of its glorious battle-fields on its colours. They
presented arms as Franklin approached, and a shout from sea and
land rent the air as the departing Governor turned round to
address the throng of assembled colonists in a few words of
kindly farewell. They were very few, for he was much overcome by
the manifest tokens of public affection which had been showered
upon him, and, shaking hands with those around him, prepared to
enter the barge which was to convey him to the Flying Fish,
circumstances having prevented him from availing himself of Sir
Eardley Wilmot's offer of the Government vessel, the Rajah.</p>
<blockquote>But as those near him retired numbers took their
places, and anxiety was visible on every face once again to touch
his hand. So many were the crowds succeeding crowds anxious for
this last honour that there was a considerable delay. At length
the signal was given, the oars fell into the water, the battery
fired a salute of thirteen guns, a cheer burst from the assembled
multitude and was echoed back from the shipping and the boats,
which filled with spectators and crowded to accompany him to the
vessel. Sir John Franklin bowed his acknowledgments, and the
barge, surrounded by a perfect flotilla, pulled towards the
Flying Fish, which lay in the stream.</blockquote>
<p>And the character of the departing Governor is summed up by
the same writer in these words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Thus departed from among us as true and upright a
ruler as ever the interests of a British colony were entrusted
to. It has been said, nay, insisted upon, that he was not
popular, and every effort was made by a few vindictive enemies to
make it appear that he was not so. Even a portion of the press,
we shame to confess it, was either forced or lent itself-to the
delusion. But has it, or have they, been successful? Let the
proceedings above described be their answer; let them hear it in
the voices of that crowded multitude, and learn how futile are
the attempts of malice when opposed to honesty of purpose. It is
difficult to corrupt or destroy the moral principle of a whole
community, and until that is done appreciation of rectitude in
another must ever hurl back denial upon those who say that the
people he governed did not admire the honesty of Sir John
Franklin.<br>
<br>
Like all men, he had his failings and his errors; he trusted too
implicitly when he should not. He believed that the honour and
honesty which influenced his own actions and his own conduct
would influence others. He trusted and was deceived, but it was
to his virtues, not his errors, that he owed his enemies. Had he
forgotten what was due to the colony he governed, and to himself,
had he consulted the advantage of a few, disregarding that of the
many, Sir John Franklin would have perhaps found a few dubious
supporters, but he would never have seen the sight which cheered
him on his departure with the consciousness of duty performed and
a popularity none can gainsay.</blockquote>
<p>From the moderation and the evident effort after critical
impartiality with which this judgment is expressed, it may safely
be taken as representing the best opinion of the colonial
community themselves, far better judges of the character, career,
and services of their late Governor than it is possible for any
biographer to make himself, with his much fewer opportunities and
at this distance of time. It is, therefore, with no little
satisfaction that I record its substantial confirmation of the
view already expressed in these pages, and arrived at altogether
independently of the evidence which it supplies.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX</h3>
<p align="center">A RETURN TO THE SEA<br>
<br>
1844</p>
<p>'<small>THE</small> remaining part of my story must be quickly
told.' So writes Franklin in the 'Narrative', from which, with
all due allowance for its being an <i>ex-parte</i> statement, I
have gathered most of the facts of this unfortunate affair; and a
biographer cannot do better than follow his example. It is
impossible to dismiss the matter altogether at the close of its
colonial stages, for that would be to leave the history of
Franklin's struggle with Downing Street incomplete; but the final
passages of the conflict shall be related with all possible
brevity.</p>
<p>Immediately on his arrival in London, during the first days of
June 1844, Franklin called on Lord Stanley in Downing Street, and
left with him a note requesting the honour of an interview. A
letter, which appeared to have been waiting his arrival, was then
placed in his hands, and proved to be a stiff official reply to
his last despatch of self-vindication, informing him that the
Secretary of State 'did not think it consistent' with the
relative position held by himself and the late Governor of
Tasmania to 'take notice', as Franklin puts it, 'of my charges
and insinuations', and stating that 'he would not make to his
subordinate officer explanations which he used to Her Majesty the
Queen and to Parliament alone.'</p>
<p>On June 18, however, Franklin succeeded in obtaining the
personal interview which he sought. At this interview his
Lordship 'said little and listened patiently'; but the result was
unsatisfactory. The Secretary of State assured Franklin&mdash;as
indeed he had already assured him by despatch&mdash;that his
recall was unconnected with Mr. Montagu's suspension; but this,
of course, was not at all the form of solace for which his
visitor's wounded feelings craved. 'I assured his Lordship', said
Franklin, 'that it was not of my recall at the usual period, and
still less at a period beyond even the usual one, that I should
have thought of complaining had it not been for the circumstances
which preceded and attended it; neither was it his Lordship's
disapproval of a particular act of my government, of which he was
the official judge, that I felt I had a right to arraign, but
because no reasons whatever were given me for that disapproval,
because Mr. Montagu's assertions had in every case been preferred
to mine, and the grounds for such a judgment withheld from me;
moreover, because the terms in which that judgment was conveyed
could not but be exceedingly painful and injurious to me; yet,
being such, they had been given to Mr. Montagu, who had no right
to them, without any shadow of consideration for me, and had been
by him, as might have been expected, made public.'</p>
<p>This last&mdash;at any rate for us of to-day&mdash;is the
point. Upon all personal and upon most official disputes there is
always room for difference of opinion, and it is quite possible
that among the readers of the foregoing narrative there may be
those who agree with Lord Stanley that Franklin's proceedings in
the case of Mr. Montagu were 'not well judged', and that his
suspension of that officer was 'not sufficiently vindicated'.
But, as to the character of the treatment which the censured
Governor received from the Secretary of State, and as to the
discredit which that treatment reflects upon Lord Stanley, there
can be among men of good sense and good feeling but one opinion.
No such man could withhold his sympathy from a public servant who
has such a complaint to make as is embodied in the following
words: 'I took the liberty of remarking to Lord Stanley that I
believed the act of giving to an inferior officer a transcript of
the exact terms in which his superior was censured was without a
parallel in the annals of his office.'</p>
<p>Into the many aggravations of this original grievance it is
unnecessary to enter&mdash;not, indeed, because they were
unsubstantial, but because they do not strictly belong to that
side of the affair to which alone I desire to confine
myself&mdash;the treatment, that is to say, of Sir John Franklin
by the Colonial Office. Some of them, such as that connected with
the dispute between the Governor and the Secretary as to the
authority for the expenditure on St. George's Church, arose from
Lord Stanley's having erroneously, but perhaps pardonably,
accepted Mr. Montagu's version of the facts as correct. Another,
and that a very outrageous offence&mdash;the private circulation
throughout the colony of a manuscript book containing defamatory
statements about the Governor and his wife, and 'purporting to be
minutes of conversation which Mr. Montagu had had with Lord
Stanley <i>before the despatch was written</i>'&mdash;must, so
far as it concerned the Colonial Office at all, be regarded as
one among the natural consequences of the original indiscretion
and inconsiderateness with which the Secretary of State acted in
the delicate matter of receiving and adjudicating upon the
complaint of a displaced official against his chief. One
incidental affront, however, for which Lord Stanley was directly
responsible, it would be wrong to omit. Shortly after the
departure of Mr. Montagu for England, Sir John and Lady Franklin
made the adventurous expedition related in a preceding chapter,
and in May of 1842 a Tasmanian newspaper published a ridiculous
story about the Governor's having granted a free pardon to the
convicts who had acted as 'Lady Franklin's
palanquin-bearers.'</p>
<p>Upon this being brought to Lord Stanley's notice he
immediately addressed a despatch to Franklin, in which, after the
usual conventional expression of disbelief in 'the unworthy
motives attributed to you', he requested the Governor to furnish
him with 'an explanation of the unusual course which appears to
have been taken with respect to these pardons', and to inform him
'whether there is any truth in the assertion that some of the
convicts had been thrice convicted in the colony.' There was no
truth in the assertion, nor had there been anything unusual in
the course pursued, which indeed was prescribed by and taken in
strict conformity with statute. Of the men to whom the
indulgences were granted, some would have 'obtained them within
only a few months' in the natural order of events; and all had,
in the Governor's opinion, merited them, not for their services
as Lady Franklin's 'palanquin-bearers', but for the energy,
patience, courage, and loyalty V which they had displayed on a
most toilsome, difficult, and even dangerous expedition
undertaken in the interests of the colony and the Empire. Of the
sixteen who obtained tickets of leave, eight had previously
established a claim to indulgence by uniform good behaviour. The
two who received free pardon, one of whom was within about ten
weeks of the expiration of his sentence, had risked their lives
in effecting a crossing over a rapid and swollen river, and
thereby rescuing the whole of the party from an exceedingly
perilous situation; and one of the men who received a conditional
pardon 'had suffered the loss of an eye in his exertions to force
a passage through the thick scrub.' At any other moment, perhaps,
it might have been less irritating to be called upon to furnish
these explanations, but to receive the official demand for
them&mdash;as, in fact, happened&mdash;by the same mail as that
which brought the despatch of censure must have been felt as
intensely provocative, even by the most patient of men. 'No
wonder'&mdash;Franklin naturally said to himself&mdash;'no wonder
the Secretary of State believes my displaced officer's story in
preference to my own, when he can attach importance enough to the
scandalous tittle-tattle of a colonial newspaper to make it the
subject of a formal request for explanation.'</p>
<p>He gained nothing by his interview with Lord Stanley. Seven
weeks passed without bringing him any nearer the redress which he
sought, and on August 3 he addressed a letter to the Secretary of
State, with a respectful reminder that he was still anxiously
awaiting the result of his application. And with a view to
simplifying Lord Stanley's consideration of his claims he
submitted seven heads of request to the Minister, bearing
respectively on the various points upon which he felt that he had
a right to solicit some more satisfactory declaration than he had
yet received. Omitting those which relate to collateral and more
or less irrelevant controversial issues, Franklin's requests
reduce themselves to the following five:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>1. I submitted how indispensable it was for me to be
assured by his Lordship of his belief that in my suspension of
Mr. Montagu I was actuated solely by a desire of the public good,
and not by personal or private motives.<br>
<br>
2. I trusted that if the explanation I had been called upon to
give of my conduct in granting certain rewards to meritorious
convicts which had been called in question on the authority of a
local newspaper appeared satisfactory to his Lordship, I might be
favoured with a communication to that effect.<br>
<br>
3. I solicited the written expression of Lord Stanley's assurance
that my recall was unconnected with Mr. Montagu's suspension, and
that the circumstances attending it were unintentional.<br>
<br>
4. I reminded Lord Stanley of his personal assurance to me that
the omission of any expression of approbation in the despatch
announcing my recall was not intended for censure, and expressed
my conviction that if the anxious efforts I had made worthily to
keep the high trust which had been reposed in me during the usual
period of a colonial government were appreciated by him, as they
had expressly been by the great body of the colonists, this
indispensable testimony would be supplied.<br>
<br>
Lastly. I requested that a copy of any communication embodying
those points with which his Lordship might be pleased to honour
me should be transmitted to the Lieutenant-Governor of Van
Diemen's Land, with directions that it should be laid before the
Legislative Council at their next sitting.</blockquote>
<p>Anxious that a reply which would have such important
consequences for him should not be too hastily given, Franklin
requested that Lord Stanley would either grant him another
interview or would, if that course were preferred, allow him to
instruct his friend Mr. Robert Brown to attend at the Colonial
Office as his representative. Lord Stanley selected the latter
alternative, and received Mr. Brown, who appears from his
manuscript memorandum to have stated his friend's case with equal
skill and propriety. On the following day Franklin received a
letter from Lord Stanley which, at an earlier stage, might have
had some mollifying effect. But matters had now gone too far, and
one can hardly feel much surprise that to a man still smarting
under the clumsy indignities which had been inflicted upon him in
the method of his removal, the terms of this <i>amende</i> should
have seemed cold and grudging. The following reply to it brings
the official stage of this most disagreeable controversy to a
welcome close:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>My Lord,&mdash;I should have had the honour to
acknowledge earlier your Lordship's letter of the 13th inst. if I
had not considered it right to wait for some time after your
Lordship's receipt of mine of the same date.<br>
<br>
It is with infinite pain that I am under the necessity of stating
to your Lordship that the terms of your Lordship's letter are
inadequate to afford me the satisfaction I expected from you; and
I regret that the more because your Lordship, having partially
conceded to me a few of the points I had the honour to lay before
you, though in language little conciliatory to my feelings, would
appear to have anticipated a different result.<br>
<br>
This may be a sufficient reply to the question your Lordship has
been pleased to refer to me respecting the communication of your
Lordship's letter to Sir Eardley Wilmot. As far as my own wishes
are concerned, I can have no desire that a copy should be
forwarded to Sir Eardley Wilmot.<br>
<br>
It would have been satisfactory to me to have been permitted to
point out to your Lordship the grounds of my inability to accept
your Lordship's letter as a reasonable reparation for the
injuries I have received, but your expressed desire that the
correspondence should terminate forbids my doing so.<br>
<br>
It may not be superfluous for me in the meantime to state that
neither in Van Diemen's Land, where the injuries I have received
in my government are best understood, nor in this country, where,
as well as in the colony, the unprecedented act has been
witnessed of the publication in the newspapers of a despatch
condemnatory of a Governor who was still in the exercise of his
functions, can your Lordship's letter, either in its substance or
its terms, produce an impression which can at all counteract the
evil that has been inflicted.</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="right">I have the honour to be,
&amp;c.,            <br>
<small>JOHN FRANKLIN.</small>   </p>
<p>Many men would at this stage have, from sheer weariness,
allowed the controversy to drop. But Franklin could no more
resign himself to defeat in Downing Street than in Lancaster
Sound. Whether the obstacle which barred his way was a literal or
a figurative iceberg, it was not in his nature to rest until he
had exhausted every means of making his way past it towards his
goal. In the present case he was making for the 'open waters' of
justice, which he saw, or believed he saw, distinctly ahead of
him, and it would have taken a good deal to make him abandon the
attempt to reach them. To appeal to the public, after the fashion
of the present day, against the treatment which he had suffered
would have been invincibly repugnant to one in whom the scruples
of the time were strengthened by his naval training and
traditions. But at least, he thought, he could set himself right
with the members of his own profession, and with the official
world in general. He accordingly set to work in the autumn of
1844, and no doubt immediately after the last interchange of
letters with the Secretary of State, to compose for private
circulation the 'Narrative' from which so many extracts have been
made. From the first, no doubt, he availed himself of Lady
Franklin's assistance in the purely literary part of his labours,
and it seems probable that when, later on in the year, the
preoccupations connected with the projected Arctic expedition
withdrew him from his 'apologia', it passed entirely into Lady
Franklin's hands. There are evidences to this effect in the
correspondence between them and in any case the 'Narrative' was
not out of the printer's hands and ready for the private
circulation for which alone it was intended until a few weeks
before Franklin started on his last journey.</p>
<p>It is a distinctly able piece of work, lucid and well
arranged, temperate in tone, strictly fair in its dealings with
facts, and on the whole as reasonable in spirit as could be
expected in the <i>ex parte</i> statement of one of the
combatants in a long and embittered dispute. But whether it was
worth while to prepare it, or whether it won over any judgments
among those before whom it was laid, is exceedingly doubtful.
Franklin sought the opinions of several of his oldest and most
trusted friends as to the expediency of circulating it, and, as
invariably happens with all such applications, each of them
replied in accordance not so much with his view of the facts (on
which indeed there was no difference of opinion) as with his own
individual temperament.</p>
<p>Sir John Richardson took up his cause with enthusiasm,
assisted him in his correspondence with Lord Glenelg and others
on the subject of dispute, and abounded in suggestions as to the
most effective mode of prosecuting his claims. Sir James Clarke
Ross, on the other hand, though equally convinced of the justice
of his friend's position, recommended him to waste no more time
on the affair, and to dismiss it and its vexations from his mind.
His letters on the subject are models of cool-headed good sense;
but there are times when the very plenitude of this quality has
an irritating rather than a soothing effect upon the recipient of
the counsels which it inspires, and this, no doubt, was just such
a time with Franklin.</p>
<p>Alien to the general character of Franklin's career as was
this unpleasant passage, one cannot, unfortunately, dismiss it as
a pure irrelevance. On the contrary, there is reason to believe
that it was not without its share in determining the events of
his future life for the brief span which still remained to it,
and indirectly, therefore, in devoting him to his heroic death.
This appears strikingly enough in a letter from his wife to Sir
James Clarke Ross, written after the project of a new Arctic
expedition had been mooted, but before its commander had been
decided upon.</p>
<blockquote>It is a subject (she writes) on which I have the most
conflicting feelings, but if you who are the right person do not
go [Sir James had already written to Franklin that he should
'certainly decline the command' if offered to him], I should wish
Sir John to have it in his power to go and not to be put aside
for his age. . . .<br>
<br>
I do not think he would wish to go unless he felt himself equal
to it; but what most weighs on my mind is this, that at the
present crisis of our affairs, and after being so unworthily
treated by the Colonial Office, I think he will be deeply
sensitive if his own department should neglect him, and that such
an appointment would do more perhaps than anything else out of
the Colonial Office to counteract the effect which Lord S.'s
injustice and tyranny have produced. I dread exceedingly the
effect on his mind of being without honourable and immediate
employment, and it is this which enables me to support the Idea
of parting with him on a service of difficulty and danger better
than I otherwise should.'</blockquote>
<p>Of Franklin's almost passionate eagerness to obtain command of
the projected expedition there is abundant evidence in his
correspondence. Apart, indeed, from his desire to get back to his
old and proper work of adventure, and to exchange vexatious
bickerings with his fellow-men for that nobler strife with Nature
for which he was so much better fitted, the prospects of the new
enterprise were specially tempting to his ambition. During his
absence from the field of Arctic exploration, important additions
had been made to his own discoveries. The gap of 160 miles of
North American coast line, which was left after the expedition of
1825-28 between Beechey's furthest eastward and his own furthest
westward, had been bridged over by Dease and Simpson, two
officers of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1837; and the same
resolute explorers had carried Franklin's furthest eastward of
1821 still further to the east by surveying the coastline from
Cape Turnagain to the Great Fish River. Nothing, in short, was
lacking to the completion of the North-West Passage but the
discovery of a channel less than 300 miles in length to connect
the already overlapping lines of exploration traced respectively
by Parry westward along the 74th parallel of N. latitude and by
Dease and Simpson eastward along the 70th. It was, indeed, the
fascinating effect of this situation which impelled Franklin's
old friend, Sir John Barrow, then Secretary of the Admiralty, in
concert with Captain Beaufort, the Hydrographer of the
department, and other men well known either as Arctic voyagers or
generally as leaders in geographical or other forms of science,
to propose another Government expedition, and to exert himself as
energetically as he did to procure its despatch.</p>
<p>In the course of the month of January, Franklin was formally
requested to consider and report to the Admiralty on the
practicability and prospects of the proposed expedition, and sent
the following reply:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>My Lord,&mdash;In obedience to your Lordship's
command, I lose not t a moment in giving my written opinion on
the question your Lordship did me the honour of putting to me
this morning.<br>
<br>
1. As to whether I considered the question of a N.W. Passage as
one which ought again to be entertained; to which I have no
hesitation of answering in the affirmative, for the following
reasons:<br>
<br>
The discoveries of Parry and Ross have narrowed the parts in
which the passage should be sought, namely, that space between
Cape Walker and Banks's Land of Parry, where I should recommend
the trial first to be made, and in case of the passage not being
forced in that direction, then to the northward by the Wellington
Channel. The ships commanded by these officers had not the
advantage of steam, and I need hardly say that the benefits to be
derived from the aid of such a power are incalculable.<br>
<br>
Having pointed out to your Lordship to-day, I will not dwell
further on this matter than to say that the addition of steam to
the ships is, in my opinion, indispensable.<br>
<br>
It is gratifying also to know that it may be efficiently applied
to the ships without destroying their capacity for stowing the
requisite stores and provisions.<br>
<br>
If the proposed expedition should unfortunately not be entirely
successful in effecting a passage, it must contribute to our
geographical knowledge, and it cannot fail to make important
additions to the series of magnetical observations which are now
carrying on in every part of the world.<br>
<br>
I conceive that the greatest impediment from ice will probably be
met between longitude 95&deg; and 125&deg;. The latter meridian
being passed, I should expect to find the ice less heavy and such
as may be penetrated with comparative facility. We know of no
islands to the north-west of 120&deg;.<br>
<br>
Should there be any who say of these Arctic expeditions, To what
purpose have they been? I would desire them to compare our
present map of that region and of the northern coast of America
with that of 1818, when these expeditions commenced. They will
find in the latter only three points marked on the northern coast
of America, and nothing to the northward of it. Surely it cannot
be denied that so large an addition to the geography of the
northern parts of America and the Arctic regions is, in itself,
an object worthy of all the efforts that have been made in the
course of former expeditions.</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="center">I have the honour to be, my
Lord,</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">Your Lordship's most obedient
servant,            <br>
<small>JOHN FRANKLIN.</small>   </p>
<p>Franklin from the first was keen in obtaining the commission
to command it, and, on ascertaining that Sir James Ross was not
competing with him for the honour, he sought the good offices of
that distinguished navigator in support of his own application,
and was most loyally seconded by him. Jealousy, however, is a
weakness to which Arctic explorers are certainly not less liable
than other people, and Franklin had, or thought he had, cause to
suspect that a former comrade of his was opposing his claim. In a
conversation with Ross I on the question of the fittest
appointments, 'he (Lord Haddington) spoke of my age,' writes
Franklin indignantly to his wife, 'and of my suffering greatly
from cold. Ross expressed his astonishment at the latter reason,
for he had never heard it even hinted at before, which, if it had
been the case, must have been spoken of by some one or other of
the officers and men who served under him; while, as for his age,
he knew from actual observation that he was as active and
vigorous as he had ever been, both in body and mind.' Franklin
hastened to confirm this at an interview with Captain Beaufort.
If his age was objected to him, all he could say was that, as to
bodily health and energy, he was as fully competent to undertake
the duty as he ever was. 'Then, hinting at my suffering from
cold, but most carefully avoiding the mention of my having heard
that it was supposed I did, I told him that I believed no one in
the expeditions I had commanded I suffered less than me. Besides,
I had mentioned to Richardson my wish to go, who approved of it,
and would certainly have advised me not if I was so very
susceptible to cold.'</p>
<p>What this 'susceptibility' amounted to will be seen in a later
chapter. The charge, due to a misconception, needed medical
testimony to refute it. Franklin accordingly asked for and
obtained the following certificate to his powers from his old
friend and companion in hardship, Dr. Richardson. 'My dear
Franklin,' wrote that staunch ally, then filling an appointment
at the Haslar Hospital, Chatham,</p>
<blockquote>I was rather surprised at your desiring my opinion
with respect to your age, strength, and power of withstanding
cold, in reference to the prospect of your obtaining command of a
Polar expedition. It surely cannot be for your own satisfaction,
for I firmly believe that you would not undertake such a command
unless you considered yourself fully capable in physical as well
as in mental power to perform all the duties it involves. To
satisfy others, however, I shall have no hesitation in signing a
certificate stating that I believe your constitution to be
perfectly sound, and your bodily strength sufficient for all the
calls that can be made upon it in conducting a squadron even
through an icy sea. When you were a younger man I had ample
opportunities of witnessing the way in which you stood the
fatigues of a land journey, such as few who had spent their
previous lives at sea as you had done would have sustained; for
it is a fact that seamen in general march badly. Your recovery
from the effects of the privation and hardship was more rapid
than my own.<br>
<br>
As to your power of enduring cold, Back and Kendall can testify
as well as myself. I think I am correct in saying that you were
not once frost-bitten in the course of both land expeditions,
including six winters spent in the country and a journey of some
thousands of miles through snow and ice in the most intense
cold.</blockquote>
<p>From Captain Beaufort, Franklin went on to see Sir John
Barrow, to whom he had repeated what he had said to the
Hydrographer, and then back again to Beaufort to repeat the
conversation with the Secretary. The Council of the Royal Society
were approached on the subject, and sent a strong recommendation
of Franklin to the First Lord of the Admiralty, who forwarded it
to the Prime Minister. These energetic efforts, which occupied
the closing days of December 1844, were crowned at last with
success. On February 5 he received the much-desired summons from
Lord Haddington, and waited upon that Minister at the
Admiralty.</p>
<p>The following account, so graphic and animated that it would
be a pity to spoil it by paraphrase, is given of this important
interview in Lady Franklin's diary notes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><i>Wednesday, Feb</i>. 5, 1845.&mdash;Sir John went
to Lord Haddington at the hour appointed. Lord H. said he had
sent for him for the purpose of telling him that Sir R. P.
(Robert Peel) had approved of expedition&mdash;that he naturally
looked to Sir John, whose experience and judgment entitled him to
command it, but said, 'Have you really I thought seriously of the
nature of the undertaking at your age, for, you know, I know your
age: you are 59.' 'Not quite', said Sir John.* Lord Haddington
asked if his constitution was able to bear it.' You'll examine
me', said Sir J.; he repeatedly said this. Lord H. said he felt
great responsibility in the matter (meaning, Sir J. says, that if
Sir J. broke down he would be reproached for having appointed so
old a fellow). He said that Sir J.'s services had been very
arduous ones from an early age. 'I know all your services; they
have been very various, and latterly you have been on a civil
service which must have caused you great care and anxiety.' Sir
J. replied that no anxieties of his present service could equal
that. However, it was bodily wear and tear that Lord H. thought
of. 'I cannot', he said, 'conceive anything more trying; I know
time has made great inroads on my constitution. Everybody knows
how arduous were your land expeditions, and how you got through
them, but you are not so young as you were.' Sir J. replied that
if he did not think himself equal to it he should not wish to go.
When he heard of the expedition from Barrow and others he wrote
to Richardson (Lord H. said he knew him), and Richardson declared
his fitness. Lord H. said he did not want any other person's
testimony to his fitness, 'only your own'. Sir J. said, had it
been a walking expedition he should not have undertaken it, being
a much stouter man than he was. He might have delayed it. In a
ship it was different. Lord H. said in one of the propositions
there was a scheme of going to the Pole. Sir J. said in that case
he should select the best officer of his party for the purpose.
Lord H. said he was glad to hear that, and would take care that
he had the best officers.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* The popular story to the effect that Lord
Haddington said, 'You are 60, 'and that Franklin replied briskly,
'No, no, my lord, only 59', is the better of the two, and I am
sorry to have to reject it; but Lady Franklin's record of the
interview is of course conclusive; and, moreover, her husband
would never have owned even to 59 in that conversation, when he
was still two months from attaining that age.]</p>
<blockquote>Sir J. said at one time, 'I've nothing to gain by
it.' To this Lord H. did not reply. Sir J. said his manner was
exceedingly kind; it seemed to be done out of tenderness to Sir
J. and a sense of responsibility in himself.<br>
<br>
At close Lord H. said: 'We'll consider the conversation as not
having passed' (or something to that effect); 'it requires a
little consideration. In a day or two you will hear from
me.'</blockquote>
<p>Two days later he received a letter from the Admiralty
informing him definitely of his appointment to the coveted
command.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX</h3>
<p align="center">THE LAST VOYAGE<br>
<br>
1845</p>
<p><small>THE</small> ships commissioned for the service were
Franklin's old friends of the southern latitudes, the Erebus and
Terror. The former was to be under his own command. To the latter
he had succeeded, with the support of Sir James Ross, in
procuring the appointment of Captain Crozier, the officer who had
commanded the same ship in the Antarctic expedition a few years
before. Commander James Fitzjames, an accomplished officer, to
whose admirable letters we owe the best account we possess of the
earlier incidents of the expedition, was appointed Franklin's
second in command, while with him were associated Lieutenant
Graham Gore and Mr. Charles F. Des V&oelig;ux, who were both of
them destined to play an important part in the actual work of
discovery. The complement of each ship was sixty-seven officers
and men, and they carried stores and provisions as for an
anticipated absence of three years. In accordance with Franklin's
suggestion, they had been I furnished with auxiliary steam power,
and were the first vessels to carry the screw-propeller into the
Arctic seas. As compared with those of the present day, their
fifty horsepower engines were pathetically weak. But many another
vessel before them had faced the direst dangers of Arctic
exploration, and yet returned unscathed. The memorable voyage of
the Rosses in 1830-33 was example enough of this. The Erebus and
Terror were exceptionally well found according to the appliances
of the time. They were excellently officered and manned. They
started on their enterprise with every advantage that human
skill, bravery, and experience could superadd to material
equipment. No adventure could have seemed less likely than theirs
to be fated to so tragic an issue.</p>
<p>Nor did any Arctic explorers ever start in a spirit of more
buoyant confidence than did these doomed men. 'Should you hear
nothing till next June', wrote Fitzjames from the last point from
which communication was possible, 'send a letter <i>vi&acirc;</i>
Petersburg to Petropaulovski, in Kamschatka.' So sanguine were
this officer's expectations that the North-West Passage would be
discovered and navigated after the first winter, and that by the
summer of 1846 they would have made their way into Pacific
waters. Alas! at that date they were either still confined to
their first winter quarters or were already advancing towards
that deadly embrace of the ice-pack from which they were never to
escape.</p>
<p>Franklin himself appears to have been at first as hopeful as
Fitzjames, and, indeed, to have contemplated at least the
possibility of accomplishing his work in an even shorter time
than the calculation of that officer. 'If we could but penetrate
to the westward of 125&deg; W.,' he wrote to Mr. (now Sir Henry)
Elliot, at the time of his departure, 'I should not fear of
getting through the remainder to Behring Strait this season.' But
he adds: 'We are quite prepared to winter, and are taking with us
provisions for three years.' Incidentally, this letter shows that
the route which he originally suggested to the Admiralty, but
which he did not ultimately take, was still in contemplation. He
intended, he writes, 'to follow the track of Parry through
Lancaster Sound and Barrow Strait, but instead of continuing on
to Melville Island we purpose turning off to the south-westward
after passing Cape Walker (the extremity of Parry's North
Somerset Island), and endeavouring to effect a passage by that
course of proceeding as direct as we can to Behring Strait. The
space to the south of Banks Land and the islands which are close
to the main coast of America is entirely unknown. We are as yet
ignorant whether it be occupied by detached islands or by a large
extent of land stretching north from the coast of America. This,
in itself, is a geographical question desirable to be settled. We
hope, however, to find it in that state which will admit of a
passage to the westward.' He goes on to say that, should they be
checked in the course they first intended to pursue, they would
'try to get to the north of Melville Island through the
Wellington Channel or some other channel on the north side of
Barrow Strait.' As we now know, this plan of procedure was
entirely changed. The first summer was spent in an unsuccessful
attempt to penetrate Wellington Channel, and in the following
year the Erebus and Terror took not a south-westerly, but an
almost due southerly course, through Peel Strait, between Prince
of Wales's Island and North Somerset Land, steering straight
towards the north coast of America and the line of exploration of
Simpson and Dease.</p>
<p>The former of these variations is less easy to
understand&mdash;unless, as has been conjectured, they were
stopped by ice at the mouth of Barrow Strait&mdash;than the
latter. For the latter would only have been a reversion to a
former preference of his own. This southern course, declares
Captain Sherard Osborn, writing in 1860, 'was that of Franklin's
predilection, founded on his judgment and experience. There are
many in England who can recollect him pointing on his chart to
the western entrance of Simpson Strait and the adjoining coast of
North America and saying, "If I can but get down there, my work
is done; thence it's plain sailing to the westward."' It is
clear, however, that at the moment of his departure he favoured
the idea of the south-westerly course in the direction of Banks
Land, to the south of which, sure enough, there is a channel, as
Sir Robert McClure afterwards proved. But Franklin was evidently
quite confident that whether by this route or another the
expedition would reach its goal. It was one of those occasions on
which his spirits always rose. Canon Wright, then a schoolboy
full of the healthy schoolboy's hero-worship, retains a vivid
recollection of Franklin's farewell visit to Mrs. Wright on the
eve of this fatal voyage, and recalls the cheery raillery with
which he put aside his ambitious young nephew's entreaty to be
allowed to accompany him. 'No, my boy,' said he, 'we are not
allowed to take any cats with us that can't catch mice.' One can
almost see the discomfiture of the youthful volunteer and the
kindly twinkle in the stout old sailor's eye.</p>
<p>As the time, however, drew near for his departure, that strong
but sober piety which was so marked an element in his character
was deeply stirred, and its spirit breathes impressively through
his various letters of adieu to those near and dear to him. On
the night before the vessels sailed from Greenhithe he took
solemn and prayerful leave of his father-in-law, then a very aged
man, though not without the expression of a hope, so complete had
been Mr. Griffin's recovery from a recent illness, that they
might meet again after his return. 'I wish', he adds, 'that you
could see the ship now. She is about as clear as she will be at
sea, and quite ready for sailing; the officers and the crew all
fine young men and in excellent spirits. This day we had the
happiness of joining together on board in Divine worship, to
praise God for His past mercies and to implore His guiding and
protecting providence. In this spirit we all hope to begin,
continue, and end our voyage.'</p>
<p>A melancholy interest attaches, indeed, to all the letters
written by him on the eve of his departure for this fatal voyage.
All, or almost all, of them have been preserved, not only of
course those received from him by his wife and daughter, his
father-in-law, and his sisters, but also his friendly and hearty
leave-takings of old friends like Mr. Robert Brown and Sir James
Ross. Their number, indeed, when considered as an addition to the
voluminous correspondence on matters connected with the
expedition and his preparations for it, which he had to keep up
incessantly for the last two or three months of his stay in
England, affords striking testimony to his extraordinary energy.
In the midst of it all he seems to have been for some time
prostrated by an attack of a malady of which the terribly
debilitating effects are better known in these days than they
were in those; but his elasticity of spirits and mental if not
physical recuperative powers triumphed even over the depression
of influenza. His letters of farewell begin at Greenhithe; one or
two are sent from Aldborough, on the Suffolk coast, a port into
which the two ships put for a day or two under stress of weather;
from Stromness he wrote several, and the last under his
hand&mdash;the final message received from him ere he passed into
that dark shadow which was so long in being dispersed&mdash;is
dated from Whalefish Island, off Disco, on the Greenland
coast.</p>
<p>Thus he writes to Lady Franklin, under date of June 7, 1845,
from Stromness:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I was delighted last evening, on my arrival at this
anchorage, to receive your very interesting letter, with those
from Eleanor and Sophy, and the papers accompanying them. It was
especially gratifying to me to find that you were not alarmed by
the reports which the newspapers had given of our position at
Aldborough, though they appear to have caused the Admiralty to
send me an order, if the NE. winds continued, that I should
immediately proceed down Channel. This was dated May 23, and sent
to Harwich for Captain Stanley to bring to me. He, however, did
not overtake the ships before the afternoon of the 29th, then to
the north of Aberdeen. The return to the Channel course was, in
that position, out of the question; indeed, the taking the course
we have done has never been a question after leaving Aldborough.
We have had only one other strong breeze, and that off the Faroe
Islands, in which during thick weather we separated from the
Rattler and the transport. The old Erebus and Terror, however,
managed very well together, and were making tolerable progress
when we were joined by the Blazer, and afterwards rejoined by the
Rattler (the two steam-tugs). It is satisfactory to perceive that
the Erebus and Terror sail so nearly together that they will be
good company-keepers. The transport sails better than either, but
we must keep her close in hand going across the Atlantic. Our
squadron is now anchored around us, and by tomorrow afternoon
will, I hope, have finished the little fittings we require, and
be ready to sail. I purpose retaining the two steamers to tow us
about thirty or forty miles off the land, when we must part with
them, but we shall be thankful for the assistance they have given
us.<br>
<br>
You will be glad to learn that the most experienced Davis Straits
seamen here and at Peterhead declare that we are quite in time.
This intelligence ought to please Beaufort and Sir James Ross.
What a kind note the latter has sent me! . . . His conduct
towards me has been kind throughout as regards this expedition,
and he has acted as a man ought to do who is convinced that I
should have spurned taking the least advantage of him by
proposing my services had he the greater desire to have gone. I
was aware, for he told me, that the suggestion was made to him
that if he would go the next year the expedition might be
postponed for that time, and also that a baronetcy and a good
service pension were spoken of as an inducement for him; but I
suspected then, and believe now, that each of these propositions
was suggested to him by &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; as considerations and rewards which would
follow his acceptance of the command, and that they had received
no express authority to make them as promises to be immediately
fulfilled. However, he richly deserves these honours for his past
services. I agree with him in the opinion that the navigation of
the Arctic Sea is not near so full of danger as that of the
Antarctic, nor, as far as I can learn, of the Spitzbergen Sea. It
is very consolatory to me that you and my dear girl and Sophy
have such correct views of the nature of our service. It is one
unquestionably attended with difficulties and dangers, but not
greater than those of former voyages; and we may trust in God's
merciful support and protection if we seek it, putting forth at
the same time our earnest endeavours to overcome them. I am
flattered by S.'s reasons for his supposing me so well fitted for
the command of the expedition; even in some respects, you tell
me, he thinks, better than Ross. I think perhaps that I have the
tact of keeping the officers and men happily together in a
greater degree than Ross, and for this reason: he is evidently
ambitious and wishes to do everything himself. I possess not that
feeling, but consider that the commander of any service, having
established his character before, maintains it most by directing
the exertions of his officers and studiously encouraging them to
work under the assurance that their merits will be duly brought
forward and appreciated. S.'s remark is a just one, that my
officers are from a different class of society and better
informed men than on any former expedition. So says Parry; and
certainly, if we call to mind those others who were with Ross,
there was scarcely one with the exception of Hooker above the
ordinary run of the service. However, I feel my responsibility
the greater from having these men to govern, and pray God to aid
me in this work. I have the satisfaction of perceiving that they
all defer to my opinion, even on points not immediately connected
with our present pursuits. Fitzjames even looks surprised when it
comes out that I have been in this or that kind of service, of
which he had not previously been informed.</blockquote>
<p>Then follows this interesting and, as it must have been
afterwards felt to be, consoling testimony to the efficiency and
high qualities of his officers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The more I see of Gore, the more convinced am I that
in him I have a treasure and a faithful friend. I am particularly
pleased with the manner in which he commenced and continues
making the sketches for you. I expect to derive very great
assistance from him if we have to winter, from his previous
knowledge of the Terror when encumbered with ice. Stanley, who is
often with us, tells me he is a very valuable fellow to have near
you. I like the ice-master, Reid, and so do the other officers.
As he begins to feel himself approaching the scene of his
labours, he opens out and becomes communicative on the subject of
ice and its motions.<br>
<br>
Crozier has not had the opportunities of being much on board, on
account of the weather; but when he does come he is cheerful and
happy, and seems to think we are making good progress. He could
not bear the thought of going down Channel. Captain Smith, of the
Rattler, has been uniformly attentive. Both he and his friend Mr.
Smith, the great improver if not the inventor of the screw, a
passenger on board, are quite delighted with the manner and speed
in which, against wind and swell, the Rattler has towed the
Erebus and Terror together. Yesterday she towed the Erebus alone
in calm weather near six and a half miles an hour. This was
proved on repeated trials. . . .<br>
<br>
Let me now assure you, my dearest Jane, that I am now amply
provided with every requisite for my passage, and that I am
entering on my voyage comforted with every hope of God's merciful
guidance and protection, and that He will bless and comfort and
protect you, my dearest, my very dear Eleanor, dear Sophy, and
all my other Relatives. Oh, how much I wish I could write to each
of them to assure them of the happiness I feel in my officers, my
crew, and my ship!</blockquote>
<p>Most heartily were these feelings reciprocated. Crozier, as we
know, was an old friend of Franklin's, had enjoyed his
hospitality in Tasmania, and had profited by the enthusiastic and
untiring help rendered by him to the Antarctic expedition. But
the other officers, who had but just made their commander's
acquaintance, had already become equally attached to him, and
their letters of this period bear abundant testimony to the
respect and affection which their commander inspired. Thus
Fitzjames writes of him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I like a man who is in earnest. Sir John Franklin
read the Church service to-day and a sermon so very beautifully
that I defy any man not to feel the force of what he would
convey. The first Sunday he read was a day or two before we
sailed, when Lady Franklin and his daughter and niece attended.
Every one was struck with his extreme earnestness of manner,
evidently proceeding from real conviction</blockquote>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Sir John is delightful, active, and energetic, and
even now persevering. What he has been we all know. I think it
will turn out that he is in no ways altered. He is full of
conversation and interesting anecdotes of his former voyages. I
would not lose him for the command of the expedition, for I have
a real regard, I might say affection for him, and believe this is
felt by all of us.</blockquote>
<p>In a later letter he writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Sir John is full of life and energy, with good
judgment and a capital memory&mdash;one of the best I know. His
conversation is delightful and most instructive, and of all men
he is the most fitted for the command of an enterprise requiring
sound sense and great perseverance. I have learnt much from him,
and consider myself most fortunate in being with such a man, and
he is full of benevolence and kindness withal.</blockquote>
<p>Here again is valuable testimony to his powers as well as to
his attractions:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>We are very happy and very fond of Sir John Franklin,
who improves very much as we come to know more of him. He is
anything but nervous or fidgety&mdash;in fact, I should say
remarkable for decision in sudden emergencies; but I should think
he might be easily persuaded when he has not already formed a
strong opinion.</blockquote>
<p>Another and a younger officer with whom Franklin was no less
popular sings his praises equally warmly if with somewhat too
much of the irreverence of youth; and we ought also perhaps to
take his years into account as qualifying what seems a rather
exaggerated estimate of his commander's advanced age. In one of
Mr. Couch's letters, beginning appropriately enough in the
familiar schoolboy tone, we find the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Old Franklin is an exceedingly good old
chap&mdash;all are quite delighted with him&mdash;and very
clever. He is quite a <i>Bishop</i>. We have Church morning and
evening on Sundays, the evening service in the cabin to allow the
watch that could not attend in the forenoon. We all go both
times. Gives sermons out of his sermon books, and I can assure
you adds a great deal himself. They say they would sooner hear
him than half the parsons in England. He has three [officers, of
course, not parsons] every day to dinner with him, and when the
weather permits the captain and officers of the Terror. He
ordered stock and wine to be laid in enough for four every day,
and for a cabin-full twice a week for three years. So you see
what a liberal old man he is.</blockquote>
<p>The coast of Greenland was reached by the beginning of July,
and the work of provisioning the ships with the stores which had
been conveyed in the transports now commenced. The voyage had, as
usual, a rapidly restorative effect upon Franklin's health. In
his last letter from this station to his sister, Mrs. Wright,
after describing the morale and spirit of his officers in
enthusiastic terms, he continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I rejoice likewise to say that the coming to sea has
entirely removed my cough, and that my health is so good that the
officers often exclaim that I am quite a different-looking person
since I sailed. When they first became known to me I was
suffering from the severe influenza which first sent me to
Brighton.</blockquote>
<p>To his friend Mr. Robert Brown, under a date a few days
earlier than the above-quoted letter, he had written in the same
buoyant strain:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Here we are, having been one month from Stromness.
Busy as bees, and, like those useful animals, laying in plenty of
stores. We hope to get our portion from the transport this
evening, and then we shall have on board three complete years of
provisions and fuel. The ships, however, are very deep, which is
of little consequence, as the sea is for the most part smooth
when there is much ice, and by the time we get to Behring Strait
or through the winter we shall be in good sailing trim and have
room to stretch out our limbs, which we have hardly room now to
do, so perfectly full is every hole and corner.<br>
<br>
The Danish authorities are all absent from Disco making their
tours of inspection, so that I have not been able to make
inquiries as to the ice at the fountain head; but I have
conversed with an intelligent man, a carpenter, who is in charge
at a station near the anchorage, and learnt from him that, though
the last winter was unusually severe, the spring was not later
than usual, and that the ice broke away from the land here about
the close of April. He had also understood that the ice had
separated from the land as far north as 73&deg; lat. early in
June, from which circumstance he considers that we shall have a
favourable passage to Lancaster Sound&mdash;which is the limit of
his knowledge. . . .<br>
<br>
What I most fear respecting my wife is that, if we do not return
at the time she has fixed in her mind, she may become very
anxious, and I shall in such a case be greatly obliged to my
friends to remind her that we may be so circumstanced at the end
of the first winter and even of the second as to wish to try some
other part in case we have not previously succeeded, and, having
abundance of provisions and fuel, we may do that with safety. In
order to prevent too great anxiety either on her part or that of
my daughter, they should be encouraged not to look for our
arrival earnestly till our provisions get short. . . . Our next
chance of writing may be by a whaler, if we chance to meet any;
if not, this note must convey to you the sentiments of affection
and esteem which I feel for you. May God bless you!</blockquote>
<p>From Whalefish Island, in Disco Bay, came the last letter
which his wife was ever to receive from him. It covers sixteen
closely written sides of quarto paper, and is indeed a
methodically kept journal of his stay at this last station of
equipment and preparation for his voyage&mdash;a stay extending
over some ten or twelve days. He was still at sea, about thirty
miles from the coast of Greenland, when, on July 1, the entries
on these faded, long-treasured sheets commence:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I begin the month in your service. Our voyage
hitherto has been favourable. The passage across the Atlantic
was, as usual, attended with strong breezes, and these generally
from the west and south-west, so that making our way across we
were led to the north and even carried within sixty miles of
Iceland before we could get past Cape Farewell, but we did not
see Iceland. It would have been contrary to the long experience
of Greenland seamen if we had gone round Cape Farewell unattended
by a gale. We had a very strong one from the south, with much
sea, which drove us rapidly past the Cape on the 22nd of June,
and continued to favour us till the 25th of June, when the gale
gave place to calm. The weather, which had been thick, now became
clear, and we obtained our first view of the shores of Greenland,
distant about forty miles; the astronomical observation told us
it was land in the neighbourhood of Lichtenfels. Here, to our
surprise, we found a bank of forty fathoms water, on which we
caught many codfish. Here also we communicated with an English
brig which had sailed from Shetland the same day we left the
Orkneys, and had come out to procure salmon in some of the
fiords. . . . From the last date to this time we have been
generally in sight of the coast, advancing gradually to the
north, aided by light winds, as also we are now
doing.</blockquote>
<p>The calm weather and smooth water had been specially
favourable to the dredgings of Mr. Goodsir, who was attached, it
should have been mentioned, to the Erebus in the capacity of
naturalist.</p>
<blockquote>The magnetic observations are likewise carried on
with zeal and energy by Fitzjames, who never omits an opportunity
of obtaining them. Each officer, in fact, directs his attention
to some point or other of inquiry or observation, and it is this
mode of fixing their energies specifically that I have encouraged
in them, and shall continue to do so, as it is the best means of
the expedition obtaining results on [scientific] points. I
impress at the same time upon them the assurance that these
individual exertions will prove their best claim to the
favourable notice of the Admiralty. Of this they are all aware,
so likewise are they that I shall have pleasure in bringing their
services duly before the proper authorities. I shall be excused
by you if I add that it is gratifying to me to know that they
have the confidence in me that I shall do them justice. . . . We
have, however, as yet seen but very few icebergs, and none of
large size. The land we have seen is generally bold and
picturesque, with openings that indicate the entrances into the
different fiords which indent the whole coast. There appears less
snow on the lower parts of the hills than I had expected to see
there. We hope to hear from the Danish commandant at Disco what
had been the prevailing winds during the winter and spring, and
in what state he supposes the ice to be now to the north and
north-west, and where the whalers are.<br>
<br>
After I had issued such written orders as I thought necessary for
the internal discipline and arrangements of the ship, as well as
the instructions to the officers respecting the various
observations which they would be required to make, and for their
general guidance, I devoted myself to the preparation of a code
of signals to be used between the Erebus and Terror when amongst
the ice after parting from the transport, and in this duty I was
mainly assisted by Parry's signals in a similar situation, which
he had most kindly lent me. Indeed, I had little more to do than
to introduce into his code some signals that are related to the
steam machinery with which we are furnished. These first duties
over, I have employed my time in carefully reading again the
voyages of the earlier navigators as given in Barrow's collection
of them, and still better in the numbers of the 'Cabinet
Library', article 'Polar Seas and Regions.' You will conclude, of
course, that Parry's voyages have not been overlooked, nor Ross's
(Sir John, I mean), in this examination, and yesterday I spent
the morning most agreeably in reading the letters which you had
kindly collected and put into my writing-desk, some of which I
find to contain opinions and discussions of Richardson and myself
on the very objects of my present expedition which will be useful
to me. The despatches of Dease and Simpson to the Hudson Bay
Company, and the letters of Richardson and myself to the
Geographical Society and Beaufort, on which Back's last
expedition was based, are also among them; these likewise will be
serviceable to me. These readings I consider matters of duty, but
I occasionally take up some of the interesting little volumes
with which you furnished my library. I have begun, since leaving
England, reading a chapter of the Old Testament with the
commentaries of Henry upon it, which I hope to continue. The
Sunday is by all observed properly. We have Divine service on the
main deck every forenoon, and in the evening of that day all
those who choose, and are not on watch, may attend the service in
my cabin, which in fact all do, and a most interesting assembling
of ourselves together it has proved and will, I trust, prove in
future to be. It is a source of sincere gratification to me when
I think upon your prayers ascending with Eleanor's and mine for
our mutual protection, and for God's blessing on each other. The
heart is refreshed and comforted by such thoughts, and
strengthened for the faithful discharge of our relative duties. .
. .<br>
<br>
<i>July</i> 4.&mdash;We arrived at the anchorage in Whalefish
Island at four this morning, which, but for thick and blowing
weather, we should have reached on the evening of the 2nd, thus
making one month's passage from Stromness. We made our appearance
off Lievely, the residence of the Governor of Disco, on the
evening of the 2nd, though we could not communicate with him. The
next day proved beautifully fine, which afforded us an
opportunity of examining the state of the ice in the Waysgat
Passage before we came in here. It was satisfactory to find from
this news that the ice thereabout had broken up, though enormous
masses were floating about.<br>
<br>
As Parry has described our anchorage, so have we found it to be,
a most snug place for clearing the transport (which is now
alongside for that purpose) as well as for the magnetical and
astronomical observations which have very soon commenced, under
Crozier and Fitzjames, on the same spot which Parry occupied in
1824. I accompanied Mr. Le Vesconte to the top of the highest
land, that we might procure a view of the groups of islands and
rocks in this neighbourhood, and take bearings for placing them
on the chart. Nothing can be more sterile than these islands are,
a mere collection of rocks with a few mosses and swamp-loving
plants in the watercourses. Mosquitoes, however, are most
abundant and of large size. I have not yet heard many complaints
made as to their biting.<br>
<br>
<i>July</i> 5.&mdash;This is a Danish station, at which live
several Esquimaux. The officer in charge of them is now absent at
Lievely, where the Governor-in-Chief resides, so that I can give
no account of the establishment at present. The Esquimaux came
off before we entered the harbour, and two of them piloted the
Erebus to the anchorage by keeping their canoes just ahead of the
ship. This morning we had a visit from their wives and children.
All of them had clean-washed faces, and hair neatly combed and
put up. Their dresses were likewise clean and good, some of them
of sealskin and the others of cotton. All the grown women had
handkerchiefs on their heads, procured, I presume, from the
Danes. The Danish Government, or perhaps merchants of that
country, have several colonies on this side of Greenland, at
which they procure furs, sealskins, and oil from the natives. At
each of these establishments, I believe, are missionaries for the
religious instruction of the Esquimaux, several of whom are
Moravians. Mr. La Trobe could perhaps give you more information
than I can as to the latter establishments. The Esquimaux who
have been on board appear to me cleaner in their dress and
persons than those I have before met, which shows, I think, that
attention is paid to them in this respect. I have to-day employed
two of them to convey a letter which I have written to the
Governor at Disco. One man would not undertake to go across the
bay (twenty miles) alone. Each went in his own canoe; it, in
fact, holds but one.<br>
<br>
<i>Sunday, July</i> 6.&mdash;The messengers returned this
afternoon with a letter from the officer in charge at Lievely,
who communicated to me that, not understanding English, he had
been unable to read my letter. He, however, referred me to the
coxswain of a boat which had crossed over from Disco, whom he
begged me to acquaint whether he could render me any assistance
from Disco. This man I saw, as well as a still more intelligent
person, a carpenter, and from the latter received the information
that, from the last winter having been severe and the winds high,
and from the ice having broken up hereabouts early in May, our
prospects, he thought, were favourable as to getting to Lancaster
Sound. He had heard that our whalers were off the Woman's Islands
in 74&deg; N. We, of course, shall rejoice to find his opinion
correct, as the getting into Lancaster Sound early and across the
barrier of ice in Baffin's Bay will be great points attained. It
seems the Governor of Lievely is absent on leave. The inspector
is also away, at some other station, and there is a supercargo
only in charge; so that in all probability I shall gain no
further information than we have gained already from these
parties.<br>
<br>
I went after church to-day on shore to visit the Esquimaux' huts
and tents, which with one dwelling-house have received the
designation of a station. It belongs to the Danish Government,
and there are belonging to it 130 Esquimaux, all of whom except
thirty are away catching seals. I have already mentioned their
being comfortably dressed and apparently well taken care of by
the Danes, and I was delighted that many of them read their
Bibles, and that the children are taught at school to read and
perhaps to write. One of the turf-built huts, which I observed to
be fitted up with seats and forms, was pointed out to me as the
schoolroom. There was nothing to invite your staying long in a
seal-catching station, and, therefore, I stayed but little longer
in many of these huts than to ask the questions I wished to have
answered. The parties I prefer seeing alongside of the ships
apart from the odours that surround their residences.<br>
<br>
<i>Monday, July</i> 7.&mdash;Still busily employed clearing the
transport, which we shall not be able to empty to-day. We are
cramming the ships as full as possible; both care and time are
requisite to make the best stowage. This necessary delay is
favourable for the magnetic and other observations which are
carrying forward on shore, and it will be satisfactory to Colonel
Sabine to know that the results by the observers from both ships
accord very well. I have no doubt Crozier and Fitzjames will
write to him on magnetic matters. I shall also write to him. I
shall also write to Richardson, and send him tracings of two rare
fish which Mr. Goodsir thinks he will be glad to have . . .<br>
<br>
I yesterday saw Fitzjames making a sketch of the harbour, of
which he intends sending you a copy. Mr. Gore has made a very
faithful drawing for you of our parting with the Blazer and
Rattler, and of them cheering the Erebus, which he has kindly
framed also, . . . My own contribution to your Arctic stores is a
pair of sealskin boots, made by one of the Esquimaux, and I send
Eleanor and Sophy pockets for holding a watch, also made of
sealskin, as specimens of the female work. Lieutenant Griffiths,
the agent of the transport, will kindly take charge of them for
you. I shall ask him to call at Bedford Place, for the purpose of
seeing you or some member of the family. He is an intelligent
person, and will give you full particulars of our progress
hitherto. . . .<br>
<br>
I had written thus far when Mr. Gore brought me in the sketch of
our present anchorage for you, taken from the opposite side to
that by Captain Fitzjames. The two ships together are the Erebus
and transport, and the single one the Terror. It is a correct
representation of the land and of our position. Almost
immediately afterwards Captain Fitzjames brought me his sketch to
look at, which he will himself send you. This is taken from Boat
Island, in which Parry took his observations, as our officers are
now doing. It will, therefore, be an interesting momento of the
scene to show him.<br>
<br>
I feel much gratified by the kind feelings of the officers
towards v you, and I am sure there is nothing they would not do
to please you. Hitherto I have invited them with regularity to
dinner&mdash;Fitzjames daily&mdash;and I shall continue to do so
until we get to the ice, or in a situation when neither I nor
they may be able to spare the time for sitting down to dinner. I
have got the master of the transport to spare what wine he could,
sugar and coffee, which amounts to 7<i>l</i>. 2<i>s</i>. . .
.<br>
<br>
<i>Tuesday, July</i> 8.&mdash;Still unloading the transport. If
we do not quite complete this job to-day we shall be able to do
so early tomorrow, and at least to ascertain whether one if not
both ships can carry all she has on board for them. Of this we
are certain, that the two ships will have on board three years'
supply of provisions, fuel, and clothing.</blockquote>
<p>And then, with that solicitude for the mental repose of those
he was leaving behind him, which was never long absent from his
mind or utterances, he continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I mention this the more particularly that you may not
have the slightest apprehension respecting our welfare, though we
should have to winter twice; and with respect to this point let
me entreat you and Eleanor not to be too anxious, for it is very
possible that our prospects of success and the health of our
officers and men might justify our passing a second winter in
these regions. If we do not succeed in our attempt, we shall try
in other places, and through God's blessing we hope to set the
question at rest. Parry, Ross, and Richardson will be the best
persons to consult on every occasion that you may feel anxious,
each of whom will give you the result of their judgment and
experience and advise you in every way. . . .<br>
<br>
<i>Wednesday, July</i> 9.&mdash;I had this evening the pleasure
of knowing that all our stores had been received on board from
the transport; but the difficulty now is where they are to be
stowed. A very large portion of them will have to be secured on
deck, but, as we have very little sea in these high northern
parts, that will not matter.<br>
<br>
<i>Friday, July</i> 11.&mdash;Another lovely day, in which we are
fully occupied in filling up every hole and corner of the ship
with stores. The transport will soon remove from alongside to
make her own preparations for sailing, and in order to leave us
room to swing the ships and find the deviations of the needle on
each point of the compass&mdash;as was done at Greenhithe. I have
written to Sabine and Parry, to each of my sisters, to Sophy,
your sister Mary and your aunt, and I think every other letter
which appears to me of importance to write. . . . The transport
has removed from us and will sail to-morrow.<br>
<br>
<i>Saturday, July</i> 12.&mdash;This is another lovely and clear
day, which makes me desirous of getting away, which I think we
shall do tonight, for both ships are now busy in swinging to
obtain the dip and deviation of the compass, which is our last
operation in harbour.<br>
<br>
I have just written the sketch of my official letter to the
Admiralty for Mr. Osmer to copy. Fitzjames has seen the draft and
approves of it. It is short, and only gives those points the
Admiralty wish to receive. . . . Mr. Osmer has begged me to
present the kind remembrances of all the officers to you. Be
assured that you have their best wishes, and I feel confident of
having their cordial co-operation. This observation may also be
applied to Crozier and the officers of the Terror. I hope Crozier
has written to you, and I have no doubt that he was desirous of
doing it.<br>
<br>
I trust that I have not omitted any point that you wished to be
informed upon. If so, exercise your own excellent judgment if it
relates to any of our personal matters. This also I particularly
wish you to do with regard to my dear Eleanor and Gell, if the
latter should come home and get settled before my return. They
will both prove blessings and comforts to you and to me. I have
written to each of my dearest friends to comfort and assist you
with their best counsel. To the Almighty care I commit you and
dear Eleanor. I trust He will shield you under His wings and
grant the continual aid of His Holy Spirit. Again, that God may
bless and support you both is and will be the constant prayer of
your most affectionate husband,</blockquote>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI</h3>
<p align="center">'TOWARDS NO EARTHLY POLE'<br>
<br>
1845-1848</p>
<p><small>ONE</small> more glimpse of the two vessels and of
their devoted crews was yet to be given to the world. They were
seen and spoken with by a whaler twelve days after their
departure from their anchorage in Disco Bay, and Captain Dannet's
record of the fact was duly published in England three months
later. A London newspaper of October 27 printed the subjoined
extract from the log of the whaling ship in question:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="right"><small>Sir John Franklin's
Expedition&mdash;Prince of Wales, Davis Straits.      <br>
Melville Bay: July 26, 1845.</small></p>
<blockquote>At 8 <small>P.M.</small> received on board ten of the
chief officers of the expedition under the command of Captain Sir
John Franklin, of the Terror and Erebus. Both ships' crews are
all well, and in remarkable spirits, expecting to finish the
operation in good time. They are made fast to a large iceberg,
with a temporary observatory fixed upon it. They were in latitude
74&deg; 48', longitude 66&deg; 13' W.</blockquote>
<p>It was to be many years before any human hand should lift the
veil of mystery which descended between the explorers and their
countrymen when the Erebus and Terror faded from the view of the
whaler as she sailed southward through Baffin's Bay. Nor, indeed,
was that veil ever to be completely raised at all. Such certain,
or at any rate such historic, knowledge as we possess of the
movements and fortunes of the two ill-fated vessels is scanty in
the extreme. The only evidence under the hands of the crews
themselves consists of the manuscript entries and marginal
inscriptions on an Admiralty 'bottle paper', not found till
fourteen years later; and by a curious mischance this solitary
and fragmentary record actually contains a demonstrably mistaken
assignment of the date of a year. For the rest, the particulars
of the tragic story have had to be filled in from the more or
less probable conjectures founded by other Arctic explorers on
this narrow basis of ascertained fact.</p>
<p>At the very outset of the narrative we are met by the
necessity of furnishing a hypothetical explanation for an
ascertained but unexpected fact. It is known from the document
above mentioned that the route already taken by the expedition
during the summer of 1845 was other than that contemplated by
Franklin except in the last resort. And this, too, although there
was not only nothing to foreshadow the necessity of this change
of route, but, on the contrary, there was substantive ground for
anticipating that the original plan would be found practicable.
Writing from Whalefish Island on July 11, Fitzjames reports under
date of the 6th of that month: 'A man just come over from
Lievely, a Dane who has married an Eskimo, says that they believe
it to be one of the mildest seasons and earliest summers ever
known, and that the ice is clear away from this to Lancaster
Sound. Keep this to yourself, for Sir John is naturally very
anxious that people in England should not be too sanguine about
the season. Besides, the papers would have all sorts of stories
not true. I do believe that we have a good chance of getting
through this season if it is to be done at all.' The information
thus quoted must have been welcome hearing to Fitzjames, for in
his diary a few days before we find the entry: 'In talking to Sir
John Franklin, whose memory is as good as his judgment appears to
be correct, it appears that one great difficulty is to get from
where we are to Lancaster Sound; Parry was fortunate enough in
his first voyage to sail right across in nine or ten days, a
thing unheard of before or since. In his next voyage he was
fifty-four days toiling through fields of ice, and did not get in
till September, yet Lancaster Sound is the point we look to as
the beginning of work. If we are fortunate we shall be there by
August 1, which will be time enough; sooner would probably put us
among the clearing ice.'</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it seems certain that their Danish informant
must have been mistaken, and that this reputedly 'mildest of
seasons and earliest of summers' turned out, in fact, to be
specially unfavourable to Arctic navigation. On July 26, three
weeks after this was written, and only five days before the date
when Fitzjames hoped to be at the mouth of Lancaster Sound, we
find the Erebus and Terror moored, as has been seen, to an
iceberg in Melville Bay&mdash;that is to say, still on the
Greenland coast, and with all the breadth of Baffin's Bay between
them and the point which they looked to as 'the beginning of
their work.' The only possible inference is that the ice had
proved to be unusually late in clearing, and that the start to
cross had had to be deferred till several weeks after the normal
period of the year.</p>
<p>What sort of a passage they made of it is not known, nor at
what date they reached Lancaster Sound; but their experiences
after entering that waterway were presumably disappointing. It is
not stated in the record to which reference has been made that
they found it impossible to proceed further westward than
Wellington Channel, but it is difficult to imagine any other
cause for Franklin's turning to the northward instead of holding
on his course through Barrow Strait. His instructions from the
Admiralty were to traverse that strait and then bear to the
south-westward, and he himself, in a letter already quoted,
declared in the most distinct manner that he should only enter
Wellington Channel in the event of finding westward or
south-westward navigation impracticable.</p>
<p>The point is of so much importance, and the course taken by
the ships during their first season&mdash;which, so far as
regards the search for a north-west passage, was a season
lost&mdash;may have so momentously affected the ultimate fate of
the expedition, that it is desirable to recapitulate as briefly
as possible the plans and resolutions discussed in the last
chapter. In Franklin's original proposal to Lord Haddington, it
was observed, it may be remembered, that 'the discoveries of
Parry and Ross have narrowed the parts in which the passage
should be sought' to 'that space between Cape Walker and Banks's
Land of Parry where I should recommend the trial first to be
made, and in case of the passage not being forced in that
direction, then to the northward by the Wellington Channel.' But,
as we afterwards saw from his letter to Mr. Elliot, he had, after
further consideration and inquiry, modified his original
proposal. To have kept a straight course from Cape Walker to
Banks Land would have led them to the channel afterwards
discovered by McClure, if indeed the route to it had been
traversable; but the difficulties likely to be met with in these
waters had evidently occurred or been represented to him, and his
thoughts were now turned in a more south-westerly direction. He
spoke of endeavouring to proceed as directly as possible to
Behring Strait by taking a course to the south-westward after
passing Cape Walker. The space to the south of Banks Land and the
islands which are close to the main coast of America is, he
wrote, 'entirely unknown'. 'We are as yet ignorant whether it is
occupied by detached islands or by a large extent of land
stretching north from the coast of America. This in itself is a
geographical question desirable to be settled. We hope, however,
to find it in that state which will admit of a passage to the
westward.' The former of these two hypotheses was of course the
correct one. Banks Land, as we know, is divided from the American
continent not by a group of detached islands, but by a large
extent of land stretching north from the coast of
America&mdash;to wit, that vast rhomboidal mass, to the northern,
the south-western, and the south-eastern parts of which the names
of Prince Albert Land, Wollaston Land, and Victoria Land have
been respectively given. In this direction, again, if they had
been able to take it, it is conceivable that success might have
awaited them; for they would perhaps have struck Prince of
Wales's Strait, into which McClure penetrated some years later in
his eastward voyage from Behring Strait, and so have reversed the
course of the first actual navigator of a north-west passage.</p>
<p>The question, however, is not as to what would or might have
been the results of taking a south-westerly-to-southerly course,
but as to what were the expectations based by Franklin on the
selection of such a route. And it is clear that these
expectations were so strong as to make it pretty certain that
nothing short of positive necessity would have induced him to
abandon a plan thus hopefully regarded, and to exchange it for
one which he had consistently spoken of as the less eligible
alternative. In short, the whole probabilities of the case appear
to favour the view, since generally accepted by Arctic
authorities, that it was the absolute compulsion of the
impassable, encountering him in Barrow Strait, which deflected
Franklin's course to the north-westward in the season of 1845. He
had, in fact, to choose between exploring Wellington Channel and
going into winter quarters even before the autumn had set in.</p>
<p>What their experiences were during the few weeks of the season
still remaining to them we have fairly sufficient means of
judging. They must have sailed northward until what is now known
as Grinnell Land rose ahead of them, and must then have turned to
the westward into Penny Strait. No doubt their idea was, as
suggested by Admiral Sherard Osborn, to try for a north-about
passage round the Parry Islands, and they continued to pass up
the strait as far as progress was possible in the hope of
reaching an open or navigable sea. But they doubtless found, as
(writes Admiral Osborn) 'we found in 1852, a wide expanse of
water much choked up with ice extending from the head of
Wellington Channel to the westward for hundreds of miles.' Thus,
again baffled, the ships' heads were turned southward, and,
holding on this course, the explorers found that the land to the
west of Wellington Channel was insular, and that the strait which
they had now entered divided it from what has since been known as
Cornwallis Island. Through this waterway they continued to pursue
their course, and eventually found themselves once more in Barrow
Strait at a distance of about one hundred miles west of the point
at which they had quitted it, thus effecting the first of those
contributions to geographical knowledge which the various
expeditions afterwards despatched in search of the missing
vessels were so largely to increase.</p>
<p>It is probable that by the time they issued from Cornwallis
Strait it was too late in the year for further operations. They
accordingly retraced their course to the eastward in search of
eligible winter quarters, which they found at Beechey Island, in
a bay near the mouth of the Wellington Channel, on the south
coast of the much larger insular mass known as North Devon. Here
they made such preparations for the long and dreary season which
lay before them as the experience of their commander suggested
and as their means allowed. No doubt the winter was spent, under
the circumstances, comfortably enough. They had well-found ships,
a beloved and trusted leader, and the unabated inspiration of
their hopes. A few eager spirits might have been disappointed by
the comparatively slight progress which had been made; but the
more experienced among the party could hardly have shared the
exaggerated expectations of their too sanguine shipmates, and the
time had been far too short to have raised any presumption, even
in the least hopeful minds, against their future success. At the
worst, they had had a bad exploring season, and better luck was
to be looked for in the coming year. Moreover, their labours even
thus far had not been altogether fruitless. In their passage up
Wellington Channel and down the new strait to the west of
Cornwallis Island they had explored and mapped out 300 miles of
new coast-line; and, above all, they had already reached a point
divided from the southern line of exploration by no more than 250
miles of hitherto untraversed water. For it was but this distance
which separated them from that portion of the American coast
along which Dease and his companions had made their eastward way
some dozen years before; and the crews of the Erebus and Terror
had already, it may be, in imagination, traversed this
intervening belt of the unknown and reached that point on the
chart to which Franklin had once pointed, with the words, 'If I
can but get down there, my work is done; thence it's plain
sailing to the westward.'</p>
<p>In the course of the winter of 1845-6 the explorers lost three
of their number, two seamen who died in January, and a marine,
whose death followed a few months later. They were buried on the
island, and the discovery of their graves five years later
supplied the first clue&mdash;not, however, to be successfully
followed till long after&mdash;to the course taken by the lost
expedition.</p>
<p>As soon as the season of 1846 was sufficiently advanced, which
would not be, it is thought, until July or August, the ships
resumed their voyage to the westward, but were not now to proceed
so far in that direction as Franklin had thought they might be
compelled to do. It was not necessary for them, as in the plan he
had sketched out for Lord Haddington, to make for 'the space
between Cape Walker and Banks's Land of Parry.' The event shows
that Franklin only suggested this south-westward route because at
that time no passage leading more directly southward was known.
It was due southward, as has been said, that his gaze was
perpetually turned, for, the straighter the course he could take
towards the north coast of the American continent, the sooner
would he reach the already explored waterway which led to Behring
Strait. He had not much westing to do in the summer of 1846
before coming upon the southward-leading channel of which he was
in search. He came upon it before reaching Cape Walker, or indeed
before attaining the longitude of the northward-leading channel
from which he had emerged in the autumn of the previous year.
This new and welcome avenue to the south divided North Somerset,
which had been hitherto supposed to extend at least as far as
Cape Walker, from what is now known as Prince of Wales's Island,
and its entrance has since received the name of Peel Sound, while
that of Franklin Strait has been given to its southerly
portion.</p>
<p>Down this channel, then, they shaped their course, full, no
doubt, of exultation at having found a passage which seemed to
lead so directly to their wished-for goal. The weather, however,
and the conditions of navigation generally must have been highly
unfavourable, judging from the small progress made by them, or
rather from the short period during which, as was afterwards
learnt from their only discovered record, they were able to
advance. For it appears from this document that their voyaging of
1846, and indeed their earthly voyaging altogether, was brought
to a close on September 12 in that year, so that, according to
all calculations, they could not have had more, and may have had
considerably less, than two clear months of travel. During this
period they succeeded in accomplishing only between two and three
hundred miles of southing from the entrance of Peel Sound, though
every mile of the coast-line on either hand represented so much
addition to geographical knowledge. Emerging from the mouth of
Franklin Channel into the wider&mdash;one fears that they could
hardly be called the open&mdash;waters to the southward and
skirting the western shores of Boothia Felix, the Erebus and
Terror held on their toilsome way until the early days of
September. But on the 12th of that month the gallant struggle of
the two vessels came to an end for ever. The ice closed immovably
round them in lat. 70&deg; 5' N. and long. 98&deg; 23', and from
that day forward its deadly embrace was never for a moment
relaxed. For the awful period of 587 days from early September in
1846 until late April in 1848, the hapless crews were held fast
in an icy prison, from which at last the desperate remnant of
them broke out only to die.</p>
<p>To winter in the pack is, of course, no very uncommon
experience in Arctic travel. Nay, to be inextricably beset for
more than one winter was not unheard of. It happened, as we know,
to the Rosses in their extraordinary Arctic adventures of
1829-33. For three years the Victory was frozen up in her first
winter quarters on the east coast of Boothia Felix, although
every attempt was made to release her, till in 1832 she had to be
abandoned, when her crew, making their way northward up Prince
Regent Inlet in the vain hope of falling in with some stray
whaler, would in all probability have perished of starvation had
they not been supported through their fourth winter by the stores
and provisions which had been landed by Parry at a point on the
eastern shore of North Somerset from the wreck of the Fury in
those waters eight years before. The escape, however, of the
Rosses and their return to England in 1833 amazed their friends
like a resurrection from the grave. It was without precedent in
the history of Polar exploration, nor has anything like it ever
since occurred. The Victory, again, was a small vessel, carrying
not many mouths to feed and victualled for four years. The stores
of the Erebus and Terror could only last for three winters, and
to have their movements thus arrested in the autumn of 1846 would
throw the whole of their remaining work on the short exploring
season of the following year. Unless by the end of 1847 they had
either found their way through into the Pacific or had reached
some point on the Arctic coast of America at which they could
winter in the comfortable certainty of being able to make Behring
Strait in the following spring, they would have, they knew, to
return home, if they ever returned at all, defeated in their
search for a north-west passage.</p>
<p>Their anxieties, however, were not confined to the future
alone; for their present situation must, to men familiar with the
aspects of Arctic icefields, have given rise to grave misgivings.
The ice-stream in which they had found themselves after passing
the southern point of Prince of Wales's Island is one of the most
powerful and dangerous in all the Polar regions, as more than one
of the search expeditions were afterwards to find. Admiral
Sherard Osborn writes, in his 'Narrative of the Last Voyage of
Franklin':&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>If we open a chart of the Arctic Regions, it will be
observed that westward of the Parry Islands and Baring Island
there is a wide sea whose limits are as yet unknown, and the ice
which encumbers it has never yet been traversed by ship or
sledge. All those navigators, Collinson and McClure in their
ship, and McClintock and Mecham with their sledges, who have with
much difficulty and danger skirted along the southern and eastern
edge of this truly frozen sea, mention in terms of wonderment the
stupendous thickness and massive proportions of the vast floes
with which it is closely packed. It was between this truly polar
ice and the steep cliffs of Banks Land that Sir Robert McClure
fairly fought his way in the memorable voyage of the
Investigator. It was in the narrow and tortuous lane of water
left between the low beach line of North America and the wall of
ice formed by the grounded masses of this fearful pack that the
gallant Collinson carried, in 1852 and 1853, the Enterprise,
byway of Behring Strait, to and from the further shores of
Victoria Land; and it was in the far north-west of the Parry
group that McClintock and Mecham, with their sledges, in 1853
gazed, as Parry had done five-and-thirty years before, on that
pack ice to which all that they had seen in the sea between
Prince Patrick Land and the Atlantic was a mere
bagatelle.</blockquote>
<p>The vastness of these ice masses is not due to any special
intensity of cold in these latitudes, but to the want of any
large direct communication between that portion of the Polar Sea
and the warmer waters of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The
channels connecting it with the latter are exceedingly tortuous
and much barred with islands; its only connection with the former
is by Behring Strait, the waters of which are 'so shallow that
the Polar ice, which has been found to draw as much as sixty and
eighty feet of water and to have hummocks upon it of a hundred
feet in height, generally grounds in it until thawed away by the
action of the Pacific Gulf Stream.'</p>
<p>Still, of course, this ice-sea sullenly obeys the law by which
the Polar waters are ever drifting towards the torrid zone, and
although the accumulation of ice every winter exceeds its
dissolution, its masses are ever slowly moving towards the south.
The march, however, is so slow as to resemble rather the movement
of a land glacier than of a Polar pack. Its frozen billows are
seldom if ever broken by lanes of water, still less by clear
spaces of sea; indeed, so compact and impenetrable is it that as
yet no navigator has ever succeeded in crossing any of the
ice-streams issuing from this ocean of desolation. 'One of these
impenetrable ice-streams flows down between Melville Island and
Banks Land, impinging with fearful force upon the exposed shores
of Prince of Wales's Land and the islands across Barrow Strait,
curves down what is now called McClintock Channel, until it is
fairly blocked at the strait between King William and Victoria
Land.' Here the southern edge of the ice-stream comes in contact
with the warm waters flowing northward from the rivers of the
continent of America, and undergoes a constant and rapid
disintegration, the rear of the ice-stream ever pressing forward,
while its vanward masses are being constantly melted away.</p>
<p>It was in the grip of this slow-moving but unrelenting enemy
that the ships of the expedition were caught fast. Had the
geography of the region in which they first came within its
clutch been as accurately known in those days as it is now, they
could have avoided it. For to the south-eastward, between Boothia
Felix and King William Land, lay a clear and promising path of
exit from the ice, a channel which would have led them to the
American shore, whence they could have resumed their westward
course through Simpson's Strait. But in that day the only known
passage to the coast of America lay to the south-westward,
through the hopeless-looking ice-stream above described, and
there was no alternative to entering it. The explorers had
already traversed more than 200 of the 300 miles which separated
Barrow Strait from the mainland of the American continent, and
they might hope with good fortune to accomplish the remainder of
the journey before the winter overtook them. But it was not to
be. On the date and at the point above mentioned, the pressure of
the pack became too strong for further progress, and just as King
William Land hove in sight&mdash;that is to say, some twelve
miles north of Cape Felix, its most northerly point&mdash;the
Erebus and Terror were immovably beset.</p>
<p>Helpless as were the vessels in that Titanic ice-stream, they
had not even the most limited choice of halting place; and winter
quarters more cruelly inhospitable could hardly have fallen to
their lot.</p>
<blockquote>Sixteen years previously Sir James Ross had stood
upon Cape Felix. He travelled on foot in the early spring of 1830
from Victoria Harbour in the Gulf of Boothia, and explored the
northern coast of King William's Land, and, standing on the 29th
of May on this very Cape Felix, remarked with astonishment the
fearful nature of the oceanic ice which was pressed upon the
shores, and he mentions that in some places the pressure had
driven the floes inland half a mile beyond the highest tide-mark.
Such were the terrible winter quarters of these lone barks and
their gallant crews; and if that season of monotony and hardship
was trying to them at Beechey Island, where they could in some
measure change the scene by travelling in one direction or
another, how infinitely more so it must have been with nothing
round them but ice-hummock and floe-piece, with the ships
constantly subjected to pressure and ice-nip, and the crews often
threatened during the depth of winter with the probability of
having their ships swallowed up in an Arctic tempest, when the
icefields would rear and crush them down one against the other
under the influence of the awful pressure from the
north-west.</blockquote>

<small>FACSIMILE OF LAST RECORD of H.M.S. EREBUS and
TERROR</small></p>
<br>
<p>From this supreme danger, however, they were preserved, and
the winter of 1846-47 seems to have run its course without
casualty. With the arrival of the spring, and, of course, long
before the season of navigation to which the imprisoned men
looked forward had commenced, a land exploring party was
organised, and on May 24 Lieutenant Graham Gore and Mr. Des
V&oelig;ux, mate, both of the Erebus, left the ships, and with a
party of six men started in sledges for the shore of King William
Land. After a four days' journey they reached Point Victory, so
named after his gallant vessel by Sir James Ross, who was the
first to explore King William Land, and who here reached his
furthest westward. Under the cairn raised on the spot by that
distinguished navigator, Lieutenant Gore deposited the record
which has been so often referred to and was for more than ten
years to lie undiscovered. It was in these terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>Thence it is to be presumed the party pushed onward in the
direction of Cape Herschel, which or its vicinity there is no
reason to doubt that they succeeded in reaching. Here they could
have sighted the American coast, and would indeed have been
surveying, in the intervening waterway, that very point on the
chart which Franklin had touched with his finger while uttering
the memorable words already quoted, to the effect that from that
point it was 'all plain sailing to the westward.'</p>
<p>The reader must be reminded that the doings of Gore and his
party after reaching Point Victory&mdash;the extent of their
advance beyond that point, their rate of travel, the date on
which they turned back again, and the time which it took them to
regain the ships&mdash;are all matters of which no records exist.
All that can be said of them is of necessity conjectural, but
conjecture can, as in this case, happily base itself on so broad
and firm a foundation of probability that we are warranted in
treating its conclusions as virtually certain. We know, for
instance, that the despatch of Gore and his comrades could have
had no other object than that of ascertaining by ocular evidence
that the American coast, and with it that line of navigable
water-way which led, as past explorers had shown them, along the
northern shore of the continent to Behring Strait, was actually
within the calculated distance from those ice-locked ships which
it was hoped that the coming summer would set free. We know,
further, that they could have reached a point of land on King
William Island from which this goal was visible, and that thence
it would be possible for them to return to the ships before, and
well before, a certain day which was thenceforward to become
sacred in the calendar of Arctic adventure. We may be sure that,
having fulfilled the object of their mission, they would make
their way back with all practicable speed to bear the eagerly
awaited tidings to Sir John Franklin. Surely, therefore, we have
ample warrant for presuming that possibilities which could so
readily be realised, and which there was every inducement to
endeavour to realise, were realised in fact.</p>
<p>The journey from the ships to Cape Victory had occupied four
days, but it must be borne in mind that the party were then
travelling over rough hummocky ice, across which it would of
course be impossible for them to make rapid progress. On reaching
the shore they would have the smooth land to travel over, and
could easily accomplish the distance to Cape Herschel in another
three days, or, in other words, by May 31. 'Their return
journey', writes Admiral Markham in a private letter, which he
kindly permits me to quote, 'with a lightened sledge and over a
road known to them would not probably occupy them more than half
the time of the outward journey, say four days, so that they
could easily get back to the ships by about June 4 or 5.'</p>
<p>The importance of ascertaining these dates is very great,
because at the date last mentioned the honoured and beloved
leader of the expedition had but a week to live. The nature of
the malady of which he died is not stated in the subsequent brief
record of his death, but the sad event is unfortunately but too
easy to account for by what may almost be called natural causes.
Sir John Richardson was no doubt amply justified two years before
in testifying professionally to his old comrade's bodily vigour
and capacity for resisting cold; but a doctor of course can only
bear witness to present conditions and appearances, and found
upon them one of those medical forecasts which unforeseen events
may often falsify. It is easy to believe that there may have been
some deep-seated element of weakness in Franklin's constitution
which escaped his friend's discovery. He had led a life of almost
unbroken activity and exposure since the age of fifteen, and he
was now in his sixty-second year. It appears, too, from the
correspondence of some of his officers, that certain traces of
that natural infirmity which comes with advancing age were
visible even in the earlier days of the voyage; and these had
presumably become more noticeable as time went on. Two Arctic
winters in succession are trying to the health and spirits even
of men in the prime of life; and the second of the two in
Franklin's case must have been spent in circumstances
exceptionally calculated to increase the severity of the ordeal.
For although the commander of the expedition may not latterly
have shared&mdash;nay, certainly did not share&mdash;the
over-sanguine hopes of his younger officers, and in all
probability was quite prepared to find his south-westward route
impassably obstructed in the first year (he must indeed have had
a presage of it soon after entering Lancaster Sound, if not
before crossing Baffin's Bay), it could hardly have been other
than a keen disappointment to him to meet with a repetition of
these experiences in the following year. The winter of 1845-46
may have passed cheerfully enough at Beechey Island, but the
winter of 1846-47, spent in the pack off Cape Felix after weeks
of laborious and baffled effort, with some two-thirds of their
food supply exhausted, and the prospect of ultimate success
growing ever more uncertain, must have moved with a much slower
and heavier step. Whether it depressed that unconquerably buoyant
spirit which a quarter of a century before had sustained his
fainting fellow-travellers on the Barren Lands, we do not know;
but if it did, one can only say that years must have effected a
total and indeed an abrupt revolution in Franklin's temperament.
Such sudden changes are not indeed unknown in advancing years;
but we have no warrant for supposing this to have been the case
here. Ample explanation of the sad event which was to follow is
to be found in the advanced age&mdash;advanced, at any rate, for
Arctic exploration&mdash;of the commander, and in the hardships
necessarily undergone by him during a sojourn of some
three-and-twenty months in Arctic latitudes.</p>
<p>Anyway, the end had come at last; the long day's work was
over, and the worker's rest was drawing nigh. The hour was near
when those most moving words of the Shakespearian lyric, too
reposeful to be sad, would be fitly addressed to this strenuous
toiler through all the weathers of life:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">Fear no more the heat o' the sun,<br>
   Nor the furious winter's rages;<br>
Thou thy worldly task hast done,<br>
   Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages.</p>
<p>But a part, the dearest part, of Franklin's wages, next to
that which was to be denied him&mdash;the 'wages of going on, and
not to die' &mdash;would have been the knowledge that the most
cherished object of his life had been accomplished, and that the
North-West Passage had been discovered. This knowledge we have
every reason to believe was vouchsafed to him. The sledge party
under Graham Gore had ample time, as has been already pointed
out, to reach the neighbourhood of Cape Herschel, and, having
thence sighted those shores and waters which, once seen, would
have assured them of the virtual success of their mission, to
make their way back to the ships a full week before their
leader's death. We have reasonable ground of assurance,
therefore, that Franklin's dying hours were cheered by the
welcome tidings of which Graham Gore was the bearer, and that he
passed away in the calm and happy consciousness that the toils
and sufferings undergone by himself and his gallant companions
had not been endured in vain.</p>
<p>On June 11 he died, and was laid to rest beneath the
ice-boulders of his Arctic prison. Like that of another leader
who perished in a less gloomy wilderness, and on the borders of a
fairer Promised Land, his sepulchre no man knoweth to this day.
That 'vast and wandering grave', the Polar pack, received the
wanderer's remains, to be slowly carried with the breaking up of
the winter towards those shores which, in the prime of his
manhood, he had been the first to conquer from the unknown.
Distressing as are such deaths and burials to the contemporaries
of the dead, they are clothed for the men of a later generation
with a dignity of tragic fitness which rebukes regret. Having
lived as he had lived, it is well that Franklin should so have
died and so been buried. England has given ungrudgingly of her
bravest sons to the most distant and desolate regions of the
globe, nor has any race a better title to repeat, and in a more
literal sense, that lofty utterance of the Athenian orator, 'The
whole earth is the sepulchre of famous men.'</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Even to a biographer of Franklin whose direct concern with the
ill-fated expedition comes, of course, to an end with the death
of its heroic commander, it is impossible to part company at this
point with his gallant band of surviving comrades. Years were to
pass before the story of their fate could be laboriously built up
on a basis of more or less plausible conjecture. But, on the
whole, we are able to trace with sufficient certainty all its
material details.</p>
<p>The crews, then, of the two imprisoned vessels, the command of
which had, by the death of Franklin, devolved upon Captain
Crozier, must have watched with intense anxiety the slow and
halting advance of the Arctic summer, during which their utmost
exertions would have to be put forth to release themselves. And
desperate, doubtless, were their efforts to effect their
liberation when at last the navigating season arrived. 'We may be
sure', writes Admiral Markham, 'that everything was done with
this end in view that could possibly be accomplished. Ice-saws,
we may reasonably suppose, were in constant use; powder was
doubtless employed in futile endeavours to break the frozen bonds
that held their ships so securely, and every expedient, we may be
certain, was resorted to that science or human ingenuity could
devise; but all were fruitless; the ships remained fixed and
immovable.'</p>
<p>It is true, that, though the ships were stationary, their
prison itself was moving. With the advance of summer the usual
thaw set in on the southern edge of this frozen sea, and they
felt themselves drifting southward with the whole body of the
pack. Hope for a time revived in their despairing hearts; for
should this movement continue long enough they would be carried
down to the American continent, where their chances of rescue and
succour would be materially increased. But their rate of progress
was terribly slow. For all prospect of extrication which it held
out, the drift of this Arctic ice-stream might as well have been
the secular crawl of the Alpine glacier. From a comparison of the
bearings of the Erebus and Terror between the beginning of their
besetment in the ice and their ultimate abandonment by their
crews, the movement of this frozen stream has been computed at a
rate of about a mile and a half per month!</p>
<p>Throughout the weeks of alternating hope and fear during which
the vessels thus drifted slowly southward from 70&deg; 5' N. to
69&deg; 46' N., every man among their crews must have borne about
with him the haunting thought that this was for them their last
year of attempted navigation, and that should the present summer
fail them, there would be nothing for it but enforced abandonment
of their trusty ships, and an exchange of the at least familiar
danger of the ocean for the unknown perils of the shore. Upon
Crozier and Fitzjames the weight of their responsibility must
have borne heavily. Both were trained and experienced seamen, and
one at least had faced similar dangers in the seas both of the
Northern and the Southern Poles. But nothing could make amends to
them for the loss of a leader who had been battling with the
perils and privations of the Arctic voyager when they themselves
were in the nursery, and who, above all, had possessed a
knowledge of the northern coast of America, and a hard-won
experience of the dangers and difficulties of land travel in
those regions, with which his comrades, if driven, as they
threatened to be, to the abandonment of their vessels, could ill
dispense. Another winter in the pack and Franklin's lieutenant
would be forced to stake the lives of his crews in a desperate
attempt to make his way to some place of safety and succour by an
overland journey through one of the most savage and forbidding
tracts of country on the face of the earth.</p>
<p>Anxiously indeed must they have watched the moving ice-stream
in the late summer and autumn of 1847, counting the hours ere the
winter should set in, and praying for but one narrow lane of
water through which the ships might hope to make their way into
the open sea. Ten, twenty miles are passed over with the drifting
ice, and still they are beset. But now there are only sixty
frozen miles between them and the open sea off the American
coast; nay, less, for could they but once succeed in rounding
that western point of King William Land which is seen projecting
into the ice-stream, they would find clear water under their
keels. September 1847 came in, and found them still captive. The
new ice was forming fast, the drift of the ice-stream slackened,
grew slower and slower&mdash;stopped. They were fast for another
winter, the third since they had left their homes!</p>
<p>And now their situation must have appeared to them desperate
indeed. It was too late in the season to think of quitting their
ships and attempting to reach the American coast in the hope of
being able to make their way by the Great Fish River to the
nearest of the Hudson's Bay posts. They knew from Franklin's
awful experience of a quarter of a century before that game was
not to be obtained during the winter months in the Barren Lands
of the continent, and were, therefore, well aware that in the
event of their being unable to reach one or other of these posts
starvation must be their inevitable fate. Nothing, however,
remained for them but to wait out another dreary winter and to
take to the land in the spring. Slowly and painfully the months
of darkness wore away, and the sun of 1848 rose upon a party
weakened in numbers as well as in strength. Cold, privation, and
disease had done their work, and no fewer than nine officers and
twelve men, besides those who died on Beechey Island, had now
succumbed. Among them was Lieutenant Graham Gore, the gallant
young officer who had traced the first entry on that record which
was to be found years afterwards under its lonely cairn. He had
been promoted at home to the rank of commander, a barren honour
but too soon to be carried with him to the grave. The survivors
now numbered 105, but many of them must have been reduced by
weakness and disease, and some, it is only too sadly probable,
were in a helpless condition. Nevertheless, the start must be
made. The choice between a lingering death by famine and this
almost desperate enterprise of escape was peremptory. By the
month of July or August in the year now dawning upon them their
stores would be exhausted, and, even if a warmer summer should
now at last loosen the pack and render navigation once more
possible, the relief would come too late. Accordingly on April
22, 1848, the crews of the Erebus and Terror, having prepared and
packed their sledges, bade adieu to the two gallant and ill-fated
vessels which had for three years sheltered them, and set out
upon their journey towards the American coast.</p>
<p>Near at hand as was now the time when their provisions would
be exhausted, it has yet been a cause of some surprise to Arctic
travellers that they should not have delayed their departure a
little longer. 'It is estimated', according to Admiral Markham,
'that they were not able to carry away with them provisions for
more than about forty days, so that, even had they succeeded in
reaching the continent of America, they would have been without
food for some considerable time, as their provisions would have
been expended long before they could possibly hope to find game
in sufficient quantity to supply their party with food, for, as a
rule, the animals do not begin to frequent the Barren Lands of
the continent before the latter end of the summer. It would
therefore, it seems, have been better for them to have deferred
the abandonment of their ships until the month of May, when they
would have had warmer weather for travelling', and when the
period at which the party might hope to have been self-supporting
would have been nearer at hand. To the reasons for their actual
decision, however, no clue will ever now be discoverable. It may
have been that they found their food supplies waning even faster
than they had expected, or it may have been that men whose nerves
had been overstrung by months of weary waiting, and whose hearts
were sick with hope deferred, had become impatient to exchange
the slow torture of suspense for the relief of action, even
though action should end only in death.</p>
<p>In addition to the provisions and stores with which their
sledges were laden, they carried also, each secured on a separate
sledge, a couple of whale boats. That they must have found
themselves too heavily weighted, at any rate for their then
physical condition, is made evident by the fact, long afterwards
discovered, that at Point Victory, a distance of only fifteen
miles from the ships, they lightened their sledges by abandoning
everything that could possibly be spared, or that might be
considered superfluous, carrying with them but those articles
that were absolutely and essentially necessary for their
sustenance. Years later McClintock and Hobson found the spot
strewn with a heterogeneous mass of articles&mdash;'clothing in
great quantities, stores of various descriptions, blocks,
shovels, pickaxes, red, white, and blue ensigns, and even the
brass ornaments of a marine's shako, the fragment of a copper
lightning conductor, and a brass curtain-rod.' That so many
useless articles should have been packed on the already heavily
laden sledges seems explicable only on the assumption that they
were taken for the purpose of barter with the natives, and only
abandoned through the fear that the weight of these encumbrances
might prevent the party from reaching the territory frequented by
the Eskimo at all.</p>
<p>Their halt at Point Victory was further signalised by an act
of vast importance to their countrymen and to the history of
Arctic travel. Lieutenant Irving, of the Terror, here found the
record which Graham Gore had left on the spot nearly a year
before, and to the precise whereabouts of which he had, no doubt,
taken care to leave directions behind him at his death. Removing
it from the cairn in which it had been placed by their late
comrade, Crozier and Fitzjames unrolled it and wrote on its
margin as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><i>April</i> 25, 1848.&mdash;H.M. ships Terror and
Erebus were deserted on April 22, five leagues NNW. of this,
having been beset since September 1846. The officers and crews,
consisting of 105 souls, under the command of Captain F.R.M.
Crozier, landed here in latitude 69&deg; 37' 42" N., longitude
98&deg; 41' W. A paper was found by Lieutenant Irving under the
cairn supposed to have been built by Sir James Ross in 1831, four
miles to the northward, where it had been deposited by the late
Commander Gore in June 1847. Sir James Ross's pillar has not,
however, been found, and the paper has been transferred to this
position, which is that on which Sir James Ross's pillar was
erected. Sir John Franklin died on June 11, 1847, and the total
loss by death in the expedition has been, up to this date, nine
officers and fifteen men. Start on to-morrow, 26th, for Back's
Fish River.</blockquote>
<p>The curious fatality of error which seems to have attended the
entries on this record was illustrated in this instance by the
elision of the word 'May', originally and rightly assigned as the
date of the deposit of the paper by Graham Gore, and the
substitution of the word 'June.' The mistake, however, is
fortunately of no importance, because its correction appears at
the foot of the record itself, where, as we have seen, May 24 is
entered in Gore's own handwriting as the date of his quitting the
ships. And that he did not inadvertently write May for June can
again be proved from the document itself, which shows by Gore's
entry that Franklin was alive and well at the time he left the
ships, and by Crozier's entry that ten days before June 24 their
commander had passed away. Why Gore's record was transferred from
Ross's cairn to the site of Ross's pillar four miles to the
southward there is nothing to show. But by a strange and pathetic
coincidence the point on the western shore of King William
Island, on which this record of the abandonment of the ships and
of the death of their commander was deposited, had nearly twenty
years earlier received the name of Franklin Point from Sir James
Ross, its discoverer, and it was actually within sight of this
and the adjoining headland, named by the same explorer Cape Jane
Franklin, that his old friend and comrade breathed his last.</p>
<p>Disencumbered of their superfluities, the crews started afresh
with a lightened load, but hardly, it is feared, with lighter
hearts. From Victory Point to Cape Herschel would be about fifty
or sixty miles as the crow flies, but to make their journey
thither round the deeply indented coast line of King William
Island, as the sombre relics of their wanderings afterwards
proved them to have done, was to triple its length. If we look at
their route in that sketch-map, 'showing the line of retreat',
which years of patient and heroic endeavour at last rendered it
possible to draw, we see a sinuous and serrated littoral, covered
with familiar names since bestowed upon it by pious followers in
the track of the lost&mdash;by such names as Crozier Bay,
Fitzjames Island, Terror Bay, Graham Gore Peninsula, and marked
here and there with the grim word 'skeleton'. The long-delayed
discovery of these remains will be more appropriately recounted
in another chapter. Here one can only endeavour to piece together
the more or less conjectural story which these scattered remnants
of mortality have rendered it possible to construct.</p>
<p>The helplessness of a certain number of the crews is proved by
the fact, which these melancholy evidences only too clearly
establish, that before the expedition had proceeded many miles in
their toilsome march it was compelled to separate into two
parties. We must suppose it to have become apparent to all that
if the abler bodied of the travellers were obliged to accommodate
their rate of progress to that of the sick and feeble, all alike
must inevitably perish, and that the only hope of salvation for
any of them was that the weakest should return to the ships while
the strongest pushed on in the hope of finding and bringing back
succour to the rest. Better it was thought that those who could
hold out no longer should take refuge on board their vessels,
where at least was some shelter for them from the rigours of the
Arctic climate, than that they should die of cold on the bleak
shores of King William Island. The few days' prolongation of
their lives might just afford the chance of assistance reaching
them, and, if not, they would at least perish by what seemed to
the imagination, though perhaps the very reverse was true in
reality, a less appalling death. Probably the cold would have
despatched the unhappy men more swiftly and painlessly on the
plains than starvation on board their beleaguered ships; but men
in their position do not reason thus, or at any rate not for
others, and probably, if the weaker members of the party had lost
all hope for themselves, their stronger comrades hoped for
them.</p>
<p>We know, at any rate, that this separation of the party did
take place, and that one division of it did make an effort to
return to the Erebus and Terror. That was proved beyond doubt by
the tragic discovery which will be related in another chapter.
The other detachment pushed on probably in much diminished, and,
we may be only too sure, in continually diminishing numbers. Many
of them must have failed to get even as far as Cape Herschel.
Those who did reach that point may have left some record of their
having done so which never reached civilised hands. They would
have been close to the cairn erected by Simpson in 1839, and it
is natural to suppose that if they had the wherewithal to record
the fact they would have done so. But nothing of the kind was
found here or anywhere else, either on King William Island or the
mainland, on the route to the Great Fish River. It is conjectured
that some of them did succeed in crossing Simpson Strait and
gaining Adelaide Peninsula, but, if so, it could only have been a
miserable remnant, soon themselves to perish. Not one of them is
known to have gained the estuary of the river for which they were
making. The points reached by individual members of the band have
here and there been ascertained by the subsequent discovery of
their bleaching skeletons, and, for the rest, the sad story had
to be fitted together years afterwards from the statements,
partly no doubt historic, but more than half legendary, of the
natives.</p>
<p>Six, eleven, twenty-one, and thirty-two years afterwards,
information which by the last of these dates at any rate must
have become mere tradition, was collected from these people.
According to them, a party of about forty white men were seen
during the spring (as we must suppose) of the year 1848
travelling southward, dragging sledges and a boat. They were very
thin and appeared to be in want of provisions. None could speak
the Eskimo language, but by signs they gave the natives to
understand that their ship or ships had been destroyed by the
ice, and that they were journeying to where they hoped to get
deer or other food. From the same source came all the tidings, if
that word be not too definite, that were ever obtained of the two
lost vessels. Eskimos told of a ship that was 'crushed by the ice
off the north shore of King William Island; but all her people
landed safely, and went away to the Great Fish River, where they
died.' They spoke also of a second ship, which 'had been seen off
King William Island', and had 'drifted on shore at the fall of
the same year.' Their account of this vessel was curiously
circumstantial. They described her as apparently intact when
first seen by them, with one boat on her deck and four others
outside; and they further declared that on board one of the ships
was the body of 'a tall man with long teeth and large bones.' But
no vestige of either ship was discovered by any of the search
parties, and the only possible inference is that the pressure of
the pack gathering, winter after winter, on that iron coast
became at last too tremendous for their vessels to hold out
against, that they were broken up, and their fragments swept
southward by the ice-stream towards the American coast.</p>
<p>In 1869 'Captain Hall was informed by the natives he met in
King William Island that the graves of two white men were found
in the vicinity of the Pfeiffer River, and that there was another
white man's grave on a long low point jutting out into the sea
some five or six miles to the eastward. The remains of five white
men were also discovered On a small island called Todd Islet,
about two or three miles off this point. He was further informed
that in a bay to the west of Point Richardson, which has
subsequently been named Starvation Cove, a boat covered with an
awning and containing the remains of thirty or thirty-five men
was found. It was also reported that a tent had been seen in the
vicinity of Terror Bay, "the floor of which was completely
covered with the bodies of white men."' Point Richardson is on
the mainland of the American continent, and Starvation Cove could
have been reached in a boat from Todd Islet, on the southern
shore of King William Island, and about twenty miles off. Terror
Bay is on the island, and full sixty miles to the west of
Starvation Cove. If dead were found in considerable numbers at
both places, it would seem as if the southward party had again
divided and that the weaker had again been left behind. Then the
last and toughest of the travellers, the thirty or thirty-five,
dragged themselves painfully round the southern coast of King
William Island to Todd Islet, left five of their number dead
there, struggled across in their boat to Starvation Cove, where
they themselves at last succumbed to famine.</p>
<p>These details, however, though possessing unhappily but too
much plausibility, rest, it must be remembered, on hearsay alone.
The discoveries in 1859 of Graham Gore's record, a boat with two
skeleton occupants, and another skeleton many miles distant from
it, and, twenty years later, of the grave and remains (identified
by a medal) of Lieutenant Irving, constitute all the material
proofs of these tragic deaths that have ever been brought to
light. For all other knowledge of the fate of our unfortunate
fellow-countrymen we have to fall back on the fragmentary
statements of the natives, and to reconstruct in imagination that
shadowy and wavering line of wanderers, 'very thin and appearing
to be in want of provisions', who were seen by the nomad Eskimos
as they dragged their boat and sledges slowly southward in the
summer of 1848, and who, in the piteous words of an old Eskimo
woman, 'fell down and died as they walked along.'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII</h3>
<p align="center">THE SEARCHES FOR THE LOST<br>
<br>
1848-1854</p>
<p><small>TIDINGS</small> of the explorers were no doubt
hopefully looked for by their friends and families during the
year 1846, but the unbroken silence gave rise, we may presume, to
disappointment rather than anxiety. The history of Arctic
expeditions is very various, and the dates at which
communications may be expected from them are of necessity
incapable of being even approximately determined. News of them
might quite conceivably come to hand within a few months of their
entering the Arctic circle, or, on the other hand, a delay of a
year or more in hearing from the absent voyagers need not of
itself give rise to serious apprehensions. In this case,
moreover, there was a special cause in operation to mitigate
uneasiness. It will be remembered with what earnestness in his
last letters to his wife and his sisters Franklin had entreated
them not to give way to premature alarms. Again and again, as we
have seen, he endeavoured to familiarise them with the
possibility of a two years' absence, and had bade them not to
expect him, or not with any anxiety, until a second winter had
come and gone. All depended, he constantly told them, on the
amount of progress made by the expedition in the seasons of 1845
and 1846. If their work were not accomplished by the end of the
summer season of the latter year, but there should nevertheless
seem to be a fair prospect of completing it in a third season,
and the officers and crew should be continuing in good health,
such a state of matters, he had impressed upon them, 'might
justify our passing a second winter in these regions. If we do
not succeed in our attempt, we shall try other places.' Indeed,
in his farewell letter to Mr. Robert Brown, he had put the matter
even more strongly still. He begs his friends to remind his wife
that 'we may be so circumstanced at the end of the first winter
and even of the second, as to wish to try some other part'; and
he adds that Lady Franklin and his daughter 'should be encouraged
not to look for our arrival earnestly till our provision gets
short.'</p>
<p>Now they were, as we know, provisioned for three years when
they left England in May 1845, so that, strictly construed, these
words of Franklin would have amounted to an injunction to those
he had left behind him to await the expiration not of a second
merely, but of a third winter before allowing themselves to feel
anxious as to his fate. Such a literal construction of his
language, however, was of course inadmissible. Even though
provided with supplies of food to last until the early summer of
1848, no exploring expedition would voluntarily have passed the
winter of 1847-48 in Arctic latitudes, for the obvious reason
that their provisions would be exhausted before the opening of
the navigation season of the following year. Hence, their
non-appearance in temperate latitudes at some time or other
before the third winter would amount to a virtually certain
indication that their ships were either lost or immovably beset
in the ice. In the latter case it would have become a question
with them of the possibility, not of extricating their vessels in
time to resume and complete their work of exploration by a
homeward journey through a discovered north-west passage, but of
effecting their escape from their icy prison to save their lives.
For before midsummer their stores would have been exhausted, and
usually it is not till several weeks later that the ice-floes
begin to move and the grip of the pack relaxes.</p>
<p>When, therefore, the second twelvemonth was approaching its
completion, when the spring of 1847 was ripening into summer, yet
no word reached England from the adventurers who had sailed in
May 1845, and who were known to be supplied with only stores and
provisions enough to last them another year, even men not given
to alarm began to feel anxious. Pressure was brought to bear on
the Government to procure the despatch of supplies to various
parts of the North American continent, wherever there seemed any
probability of falling in with the missing men, and the prompt
organisation of a search for them was also urged. The Admiralty,
as is the way of public departments, elected to do the easier
thing first, and to put off the other; and arrangements were made
with the Hudson's Bay Company for the stocking of their most
northern stations with a large supply of
provisions&mdash;seventy-four days' rations for 120 men&mdash;in
readiness for the explorers in the event of their having
abandoned their ships for an attempted retreat by land. The
Company's officers at their various posts were also instructed to
warn the Indians to look out for and assist any surviving members
of the party that they might happen upon. Large rewards were
offered by the Government to the masters and crews of all ships
employed in the whale fishery in Baffin's Bay if they should
'succeed in obtaining any information or record of the progress
of the Erebus and Terror through Lancaster Sound, and to the
westward'; to which was added a reward of 2,000<i>l</i>. offered
by Lady Franklin herself for information as to her husband's
fate.</p>
<p>Thus passed the year 1847. In the following spring the
Government proceeded to organise the first of the many
expeditions which were despatched in search of the illustrious
navigator and his crews. It consisted of two vessels, the
Enterprise, of 471 tons, and the Investigator, of 420 tons
burden, with Captain Sir James Clark Ross in chief command and
Captain Bird in command of the second ship. The former officer's
Arctic record has often been referred to in these pages; the
latter had taken part in Parry's memorable attempt to reach the
North Pole in 1827. A second expedition, under the command of
Franklin's old comrade Sir John Richardson, accompanied by Mr.
John Rae, an officer of the Hudson's Bay Company, of whom more
hereafter, was despatched with directions to proceed overland
through the Hudson's Bay Territory, to descend the Mackenzie
River and examine the coast thence to the Coppermine River, as
also the southern and western shores of Wollaston Land. And yet a
third expedition, consisting of the Herald, under Captain
Kellett, and the Plover, under Commander Moore, was sent to
Behring Strait, with instructions to proceed as far as possible
to the eastward, and to endeavour to communicate with the party
under the command of Sir John Richardson.</p>
<p>But a word must here be said about Richardson's second in
command, a man of remarkable gifts as a traveller, and one whose
indefatigable labours have given him, apart from his services in
connection with the search for Franklin, a foremost place among
explorers of the Arctic coasts. John Rae, by birth an Orkney man
and educated at Edinburgh University for the medical profession,
had, at the age of barely twenty, obtained the post of surgeon to
a ship of the Hudson's Bay Company, in whose service he had been
for twelve years, when, in 1845, he was placed by them in command
of an expedition in two small boats to the Arctic seas, to
endeavour to complete the survey of some 700 miles of coast,
forming the shores of a large bay left unexplored by Parry in
1822-23. Setting out from York Factory in 1846 with this modest
equipment, a party of ten men, and only four months' provisions,
Rae accomplished a voyage of 900 miles, during which much
dangerous obstruction by ice was met with, and, reaching latitude
66&deg; 32' N., in Repulse Bay, which was intended to be the
starting point of the survey, spent there a very severe winter,
during which the temperature often fell to 35&deg; and 40&deg;
below zero. Early in April foot journeys were commenced and
carried out to the extent of over 1,300 miles, whereby 700 miles
of new coast line were surveyed, thus practically uniting the
surveys of Ross on Boothia with Parry's explorations at
Hecla-and-Fury Strait. Such a record as this was naturally
calculated to catch the eye, and arouse the admiration, of an old
Arctic traveller like Sir John Richardson, and Rae had not long
reached London in 1847 when he received from him an offer of the
post of second in command of the expedition which Sir John was
personally organising for the search after his missing comrade
and friend. The offer was accepted, and, the boats and crews
having been sent out to York Factory in 1847, Richardson and Rae
left England in the early spring of 1848, and in the course of
the season the two explorers made a thorough examination of the
Arctic shores of America, from the Mackenzie River eastward to
the Coppermine, without finding any clue to the missing
expedition. They wintered at Fort Confidence, on Great Bear Lake,
and in the spring of 1849 Richardson returned to England, while
Rae remained behind for the purpose of returning to the sea by
the Coppermine River, and crossing thence over the strait which
divides the continent from Wollaston Land, and which had been
rendered impassable the previous season. In 1851 Rae was
appointed to the command of another search expedition to the
Arctic coast, with no other instructions than to take the route
he thought best. In the course of this expedition Rae,
accompanied by two other men, made a sledge journey of over 1,000
miles, searching every corner along the shore of Wollaston Land.
The whole coast eastward of the Coppermine River, as also that of
Victoria Land, was also examined, and the Victoria Strait, the
actual channel in which the Erebus and Terror had been finally
beset four years before, was discovered and named. Rae and his
companions attained indeed to about the latitude at which the
ships were icebound, though, coasting along the shore of Victoria
Land, he was of course divided from that of King William Island,
off which they were finally abandoned, by a distance of some four
or five degrees of longitude. Rae returned by way of the Lakes
and Fort Winnipeg, having covered either by boat, sledge, or
snow-shoes, a distance of 5,380 miles during his eight months of
continuous travel. For this and for his survey of 1847 he was
rewarded in 1852 with the Founders' gold medal of the Royal
Geographical Society.</p>
<p>From 1848 onward, for a period of some six years without
intermission, and intermittently for some eleven years, the
search for Franklin was prosecuted&mdash;at first officially,
afterwards by private enterprise, at last by Lady Franklin alone.
From first to last the number of search expeditions despatched
from this country and America amounted to as many as thirteen,
without reckoning overland journeys, and the Arctic Ocean was
entered by no fewer than twenty-four different vessels (including
repeated voyages of the same vessel) in the course of this long
and fruitless quest. The wide range of hitherto unexplored land
and water which their crews traversed and the immense value of
their contributions to geographical science will appear in the
course of this narrative; but an examination of the area of their
travels only makes their prolonged failure to raise the veil of
obscurity which shrouded Franklin's fate the more remarkable. It
would be an almost pardonable exaggeration to say that they
discovered nearly everything except what they sought.</p>
<p>That they missed it for so long was partly due to sheer
perversity of luck, but in some measure also to perversity of
official instructions. In the case of the first three
expeditions, the former agency was alone at work. No one could
have known that the Erebus and Terror might not in this, the
third year of their absence, be nearing the end of their journey
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and in that case either Kellett
or Richardson might very well have fallen in with them at some
point on the North American coast between Behring Strait and the
mouth of the Mackenzie or even of the Coppermine River, and have
been able, no doubt, to render them valuable assistance. As to
Sir James Ross, who left England with his two ships on July 12,
1848, he was not, indeed, able to make much progress in the
course of that year, being compelled by the ice which he
encountered in Barrow Strait to seek winter quarters in Port
Leopold, on the north-east coast of North Somerset. But in the
following spring the eastern and western coasts of Prince Regent
Inlet were thoroughly explored by the expedition, and in
particular a certain point on the western coast was reached by
them, at which there was some reason to think that they might
fall in with the missing crews, and to which, indeed, it is by no
means improbable that their commander seriously considered the
question of directing his course after the abandonment of the
ships. The point in question was Fury Beach, the scene of the
wreck of Parry's ship of that name in 1825. It must have been
known to Crozier, who had served in Parry's expedition, that
there was here a large store of provisions which had been landed
from the Fury at the time of her loss. Fury Beach, however, was
seventy or eighty miles north of the point at which the Erebus
and Terror were beset. To have made for it would have involved
something like an actual retracing of the course of the
expedition, and, having regard to the possibility that the
provisions might have been discovered and appropriated by the
Eskimos,* one can hardly wonder that Crozier declined the
responsibility of such a return upon his footsteps, and decided
to push on towards the south.</p>
<p class="foot">[* As a matter of fact, these stores and
provisions were found by Admiral Markham 'in a perfect state of
preservation' in 1873, nearly fifty years after their original
deposit.]</p>
<p>Even as it was, however, Ross really hit upon the right track,
and, had he been able to follow it up, he would have solved that
problem which had to wait nearly another ten years for its
solution. For in this same spring of 1849 he sledged along the
eastern coast of Peel Strait as far south as latitude 72&deg; 38'
N., or but little more than two degrees from the point at which
the Erebus and Terror wintered in 1846-47, and less than three
from the spot at which, after their slow drift of some twenty
miles with the moving ice-pack in the summer of 1847, they had in
the following spring been abandoned. Had Ross, then, and his
companion McClintock been able to make their way but two hundred
miles further&mdash;a trifle to that indefatigable sledger who
afterwards covered thousands of miles by this mode of travel in
repeated search expeditions&mdash;the latter would have
anticipated his discoveries of 1859. For in lat. 69&deg; 46' or
thereabouts lay the two derelict vessels, and on the coast of
King William Island, a few miles to the SSE. of that point, was
the cairn and the record which would have cleared up the mystery
as to the fate of their crews. That any of them could then have
been rescued is no doubt extremely improbable. Franklin had been
dead two years, and it was more than a year since the vessels
were abandoned. That thin and straggling line of famine-stricken
men which has left sombre traces of itself along the route to the
American coast, must ere this have ceased its march for ever. The
last of those heroic fighters with death in the most terrible of
his shapes must have 'fallen down and died as he walked along.'
But the ships were probably still there, or not far off, even if
the ice-pack should have carried them a little further south, and
the discovery of the ships would have guided them to the cairn.
England and the lost men's families would have known in 1849
instead of 1859 the whole sad truth, and the toil, the
expenditure, and, above all, the vain yearnings of years would
have been spared. But it was not to be. Ross and McClintock had
nearly exhausted their store of provisions, and were forced to
return to Cape Leopold without discovering any traces of what
they sought. Nor must we forget to reckon on the other side of
the account that, had they then and there succeeded in clearing
up the mystery, our Arctic explorers would have lost that
stimulus to adventure which was for the next seven or eight years
to impel them upon enterprises redounding to the maritime glory
of their country and extending the dominion of geographical
science over vast tracts of land and ocean hitherto
unexplored.</p>
<p>The return of Sir James Ross and Sir John Richardson
unsuccessful from their respective missions in the autumn of 1849
was rightly and laudably regarded by the Government of the day as
a summons to fresh exertions. In the year 1850 no fewer than six
separate expeditions were despatched in quest of the lost
explorers&mdash;two of them of a fully official character, and
manned by officers of the British Navy; a third subsidised by the
Government; and the other three privately organised. The
Enterprise was again sent out, this time under Captain Collinson,
while Commander McClure, who had served in it as a first
lieutenant under Ross in its late expedition, was appointed to
the command of the Investigator. The route of the two vessels
was, however, on the second occasion reversed. They were to
approach the field of search from the west instead of from the
east; and they sailed from England for Behring Strait in January
1850, with orders to enter the Arctic Ocean through that channel,
and thence to proceed with all speed to the eastward, examining
Melville Island, Banks Land, Wollaston Land, Victoria Land, or
otherwise according to the discretion of Captain Collinson. Their
voyage was a famous one in Arctic history, but its details must
for the present be reserved.</p>
<p>Less important in its geographical results, but far more so in
its relation to the primary object of these undertakings, was the
expedition despatched four months later under Captain Austin, in
command of the Resolute, and Captain Erasmus Ommanney, commanding
the Assistance, whose instructions were to carry out an
exhaustive search through Lancaster Sound in the direction of
Melville and the Parry Islands. It was to this expedition,
assisted by the efforts of two whaling brigs, under the command
of Captains Penny and Stewart, which had been despatched by the
Government with orders to undertake the examination of Jones
Sound and Wellington Channel, that the first discovery of any
traces of their lost countrymen was due. The three other search
parties, however, though but one of them rendered any service,
and that merely as a bearer of intelligence, must not pass
unnoticed. One of them was fitted out by an American citizen, Mr.
Henry Grinnell, and was manned by officers and men of the United
States Navy; Lady Franklin at her own expense equipped another,
the Prince Albert, a schooner of ninety tons, captained by
Commander Forsyth, and instructed to explore the shores of Prince
Regent Inlet; and, finally, the veteran Sir John Ross, then in
his seventy-fourth year, started off for Baffin's Bay and
Lancaster Sound in a small vessel called the Felix, accompanied
by a still smaller one, a yacht of twelve tons, the two equipped
and fitted out partly at the cost of the Hudson's Bay Company and
partly by private subscription.</p>
<p>The expedition under Captain Austin's command was not long in
meeting with its good fortune. His ships wintered at Griffith
Island in Barrow Strait, but before seeking their winter quarters
they made the first discovery which had as yet rewarded these
manifold and extensive investigations. It is to the Assistance
and its commander that the honour of this welcome 'find' belongs.
At Point Riley, the headland on the south shore of North Devon
which forms the eastward arm of the natural harbour completed by
Beechey Island on the west, Captain Ommanney lighted upon
conspicuous and unmistakable traces of a winter encampment, and
soon afterwards, on Beechey Island itself, Captain Penny found,
each marked with simple headstone and epitaph, the graves already
referred to of the three lost members of the expedition&mdash;the
two seamen and the marine. Further examination revealed the exact
spot at which the ships had been laid up, and even yielded
evidences of the manful and cheerful fashion in which the crews
had whiled away the monotony of the winter. 'The ruins and traces
which they left behind them,' wrote Admiral Sherard Osborn,
himself a member of the expedition, 'all attest it.'</p>
<blockquote>The observatory, with its double embankment of earth
and stones, its neat finish and the lavish expenditure of labour
in pavement and pathway; the shooting gallery under the cliff;
the seats formed of stones; the remains of pleasant picnics in
the form of empty bottles and meat tins strewed about; the
elaborate cairn on the north point of Beechey, a pyramid of eight
feet high and at least six feet long on each side of the base,
constructed of old meat-tins filled with gravel, all tell the
same tale of manful anxiety for physical employment to distract
the mind from suffering and solitude. On board the ships we
picture to ourselves the Arctic school and theatre; the scholars
and dramatists exerting themselves to kill monotony and amuse or
instruct their comrades. There are not wanting traces at Cape
Riley to show how earnestly the naturalists Goodsir and Stanley
laboured to collect specimens; now was there time to arrange and
note their labours. There is more than one site still visible of
tents in which the magnetical observations were obtained; now was
the time to record and compare such observations. And in addition
to the charming novelty of a first winter in the frozen sea, the
officers in so scientific an expedition had abundance of
employment in noting the various phenomena which were daily and
hourly occurring round them.</blockquote>
<p>A word here in further reference to the meat-tins above
mentioned, which were labelled 'Goldner's Patent', for on them
hangs a scandalous and hideous: tale. Seven hundred of these
articles were counted, and must have contained, it is calculated,
a considerably larger quantity of such food than the crews could
possibly have consumed during their first winter; and from the
fact that an enormous number of these tins supplied to the Navy
were subsequently found to contain putrid meat, it is inferred
that many or most of those tins discovered on Beechey Island had
been condemned on the same ground. If this inference be
well-founded, the loss of so large a proportion of what would be
considered fresh in contradistinction to salt provisions would be
most serious, and might 'so cripple their resources as to lead in
all probability to the disastrous fate of the expedition.' Such,
at least, is Admiral Markham's belief; his brother-officer,
Admiral Osborn, contents himself with the less circumstantial but
no less significant observation: 'Sad it is to record it, but
nearly all their preserved meats were those of the miscreant
Goldner.' And though the renown of contractors for exploits of
this kind is historic, the man who supplied putrid meat to the
crews of an Arctic expedition certainly seems to merit an infamy
as lasting in human memory as the fame of the victims whom he
supplied with poison because it was more profitable than
supplying them with food. He is, at any rate, welcome to the
humble effort here made to 'plead against oblivion for his
name.'</p>
<p>It must, however, be admitted that the relics discovered at
Beechey Island gave evidence of other elements of weakness than
that created by the villany of a contractor. Exploring parties
had evidently been despatched by Franklin in a northward
direction along the eastern shore of Wellington Channel, where
the marks of encampments and the trails of sledges were frequent.
But in Admiral Osborn's view they told a somewhat disquieting
tale:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>It was sad to remark, from the form of their
cooking-places and the deep ruts left by their sledges over the
edge of the terraces which abound in Beechey Island, how little
Franklin's people were impressed with the importance of rendering
their travelling equipment light and portable, both as a means of
exploration while their ships were imprisoned and to enable them
to escape if their ships were destroyed. The anxiety for their
fate expressed by many in Captain Austin's expedition when
remarking upon the fearful expenditure of labour which must have
been entailed on Franklin's men in dragging about such sledges as
they evidently had with them, has been [1860] only too fully
verified. The longest journey made by sledge parties from the
Erebus and Terror at Beechey Island, so far as we know, did not
exceed <i>twenty</i> miles. Franklin's experience of travelling
in the Hudson Bay Territory was evidently at fault in the rugged
and desert region in which he was now sojourning, and he had no
McClintock at his side to show him how by mechanical skill and
careful attention to weights and equipment sledges ought to be
constructed, on which men might carry boats, tents, clothing,
food, and fuel, and travel with impunity from February to August,
and explore, as he himself had done in that time, 1,400 miles of
ground or frozen sea. However, no anxieties then pressed on the
minds of those gallant men; 'large water' was all they thought
of; give them that, and Behring's Strait in their ships was still
their destination.</blockquote>
<p>Immediately on the discovery of Franklin's first winter
quarters, the Prince Albert, the vessel equipped by Lady
Franklin, hastened home with the intelligence. The other ships
remained to winter, as has been said, in Barrow Strait, but not
before a thorough, though futile, search had been made in every
nook and corner of Beechey Island for some record or document
from which a clue to the intended course of the Erebus and Terror
in the summer of 1846 might be obtained.</p>
<p>Nor, it may be imagined, with their recent discoveries to
encourage them, were they likely to remit their efforts during
the following year. The spring and summer of 1851 were spent in
the industrious exploration of the surrounding territory in every
direction, both by sea and land. Captain Penny sailed up
Wellington Channel to the northward, and no fewer than five
sledge expeditions were despatched by Captain Austin to the south
and west. One of these, under Lieutenant McClintock, explored to
the westward as far as Melville Island; two others, under
Ommanney and Sherard Osborn respectively, prosecuted a
south-westward search from Cape Walker along the south and west
coasts of Prince of Wales Land. A fourth, travelling in the same
direction, namely, by way of Cape Walker, ascertained the
insularity of the land from which that headland projects, and
which is now known as Russell Island. And, finally, an expedition
again unconsciously hitting off, like that of Sir James Ross, the
route taken by the missing ships, pursued a course along the
western shore of Peel Sound as far south as 72&deg; 49', or
within 150 miles of the spot at which the Erebus and Terror were
abandoned.</p>
<p>It will be observed, however, that while for the second time
the track of the explorers had been struck by a sledging party
which, as it happened, had not the best chance of following up
its clue to the wished-for goal, the maritime operations of the
expedition, which alone could have brought them within sight of
the deserted vessels&mdash;if, indeed, their timbers still held
together&mdash;were again misdirected. It is true that both
Wellington Channel and a route to the southward and westward of
Cape Walker were mentioned in Franklin's instructions, but both
in those instructions, and still more distinctly in Franklin's
own letters from which quotations have already been made, the
former of these two routes is treated as the 'second best' of two
alternatives. The Erebus and Terror, it is repeatedly insisted
upon, were only to make for Wellington Channel in the event of
their finding their westward progress obstructed in Barrow
Strait. Yet both now and afterwards we find search parties
invariably shaping a northward or north-westward course after
entrance into Barrow Strait, instead of, as one would have
expected, holding on in a westerly direction with the hope of
finding an opening to the south. It may be that the despatch of
sledging parties along the shore of Peel Sound was regarded as
sufficient provision against the possibility of Franklin's ships
having found and threaded this southward-leading channel, since
it was perhaps assumed that they would in that case find the
route of the missing vessels indicated by cairns; and, indeed,
the total absence of this familiar form of Arctic beacon has
always puzzled the most experienced inquirers. Cairns are easily
constructed from material always at hand. They form conspicuous
landmarks, and their importance as such, writes Admiral Markham,
'was well known to Franklin and his officers. If they had been
erected, the direction for the search would have been indicated,
and an enormous amount of labour would have been saved, while a
successful issue of the search would possibly have been the
result. The only reason that can be advanced for this apparent
neglect of what has always been regarded as one of the most
important duties of an Arctic explorer is the supposition that
the channels were comparatively clear of ice when the Erebus and
Terror passed through, and that it was in consequence deemed
inexpedient to delay the progress of the vessels by stopping to
build cairns&mdash;a serious omission, however, for their absence
necessitated the expenditure of much invaluable time besides a
great waste of money in the prosecution of a long and fruitless
search.'</p>
<p>On the return of the Prince Albert in 1850 with the news of
the discoveries on Beechey Island, Lady Franklin's hopes of
ascertaining her husband's fate were naturally quickened. The
vessel was again despatched in the following year, under the
command of Mr. Kennedy, and numbering, it is pleasant to record,
the veteran John Hepburn among its crew. The voyage led to the
discovery of Bellot Strait, the channel separating Boothia Felix
from North Somerset; and by traversing which Mr. Kennedy of
course found himself in Franklin Strait, and therefore on
Franklin's track. Had he turned to the southward, another 510
miles' sail would have brought him to the fatal spot. But no; the
same invincible determination to set the face to the northward
governed the movements of Kennedy as it had those of the
searchers who had preceded, and of some who were to follow him.
Issuing from Bellot Strait&mdash;so named after the gallant and
unfortunate young officer of the French Navy who had volunteered
for this service, in the course of which he lost his life by
drowning&mdash;the Prince Albert's course was directed up
Franklin Strait to the north-east point of Prince of Wales Land,
which the lost explorers had only skirted and never touched at,
and where, therefore, no traces of them could possibly be
discoverable, Mr. Kennedy returned to England in 1852, and in the
course of the same year Lady Franklin fitted out a screw steamer,
the Isabel, which also returned unsuccessful after an
(apparently) somewhat aimless three months' cruise in Baffin's
Bay.</p>
<p>In 1852, moreover, another attempt was made by Government on
the larger scale. The four ships of Captain Austin's squadron,
the Assistance and Resolute, with the two steam tenders Intrepid
and Pioneer, were again refitted and sent out under Captain Sir
Edward Belcher, flying his pennant in the Assistance, in chief
command, and with Captains Kellett, McClintock, and Sherard
Osborn in command of the three other vessels of the squadron.
Here, again, the instructions given to the commander were to sail
anywhere except in the direction which Franklin might have been
known to have taken. He was to despatch one of the vessels with
its steam tender up Wellington Channel, which it was perfectly
understood that Franklin was not to enter save in the last
resort; while the other vessel and its steamer were to push
westward towards Melville Island, a route which Franklin had been
specially warned to avoid in consequence of the obstructing ice
masses which had been met with and reported upon by Parry in
those waters, and which, as we have already seen, he had fully
determined to avoid.</p>
<p>There was, however, a better reason for prescribing this
course to Sir Edward Belcher than there had been for the
instructions given to the commanders of previous expeditions, for
in truth it was not in search of Franklin alone that he had been
sent out. That earlier search-party, the expedition of Collinson
and McClure, in the Investigator and the Enterprise, of whose
memorable adventures I have hitherto delayed to speak, had now
been absent more than two years, and fears for their safety had
begun to be entertained. Sir Edward Belcher's movement to the
westward was therefore no doubt prescribed to him, in part at
least, with the view of rendering assistance to these vessels,
which it was supposed might have reached positions on Melville
Island.</p>
<p>One of them, as it turned out, was sorely enough in need of
aid, and the course of this narrative must be arrested for a
moment to trace the history, so famous in our Arctic annals, of
the Investigator's great cruise. Sailing from England on January
20, 1850, the Enterprise and her consort passed through the
Straits of Magellan, and, touching at the Sandwich Islands,
proceeded at once to Behring Strait; but shortly after entering
the Pacific the two vessels accidentally parted company, never to
sight each other again during the whole remainder of the voyage.
Passing through the Strait, the Investigator sailed along the
north coast of America as far as longitude 130&deg; W., when
McClure shaped his course to the north-eastward and discovered a
channel between Banks Land and Prince Albert Land now known as
Prince of Wales Strait This, leading as it does to waters which
had been already entered by other explorers from the eastward,
may be regarded as the last link of the North-West Passage.
McClure, however, was to discover not one but two such passages
during his three years' sojourn in the Polar Seas. Having
wintered in Prince of Wales Strait, the Investigator retraced her
course to the southern point of Banks Land, and in the course of
the next season her captain succeeded in completely
circumnavigating this island (as it proved to be) and discovering
a path of re-entry into known waters by a new channel, now called
McClure Strait, between Banks Land and Melville Island, which is
in fact a second north-west passage.</p>
<p>The gallant Investigator was not fated to complete the course
herself; for in 1851 she was frozen up hard and fast in the Bay
of God's Mercy, on the north coast of Banks Land, where she
remained immovably fixed for two entire winters. In the summer of
1853, had relief not reached them, McClure had resolved to
abandon his ship and attempt a retreat on the Mackenzie or
Coppermine Rivers; but, fortunately, that desperate and in all
probability fatal undertaking was not actually forced upon them.
They had happily taken the precaution to deposit at Winter
Harbour, on Melville Island, a record of their plight, and the
providential discovery of this by McClintock in 1852, during a
sledging expedition over Melville Island, led to the institution
of a successful search for the imprisoned ship in the following
year. The Investigator, still ice-beset in the Bay of God's
Mercy, had to be abandoned where she lay. Her captain and crew
were transferred to the Resolute, and, after a fourth winter
spent in the Arctic Regions, they were conveyed to England
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Lancaster Sound and Baffin's Bay, the first
navigators who had ever crossed from the Pacific to the Atlantic
Ocean by way of the north coast of America. In recognition of
this great achievement the sum of 10,000<i>l</i>. was awarded by
the English Government to McClure and his crew.</p>
<p>Their rescue, however, was the only success achieved by the
expedition under Sir Edward Belcher. Occupied as they were in
industriously scouring land and sea to the north of Barrow Strait
in search of a party of explorers who had been specially directed
to take a course to the south-west of that channel, their efforts
were not likely to be very fruitful, and it is scarcely necessary
to describe them in detail. Suffice it to say that their whole
voyage, besides being one of useless toil, was specially marked
out for misfortune. The Assistance and Pioneer got frozen up in
Wellington Channel in 1853, and had there to spend their second
winter; and the Resolute and Intrepid, also caught by the ice,
were compelled to winter in the pack in Melville Sound. In the
following year, Sir Edward Belcher, for some unexplained reason,
ordered the abandonment of all four ships, the officers and crews
of which were conveyed to England in other vessels. A
court-martial was in due course held upon the officers concerned,
and resulted in their acquittal; but Sir Edward Belcher's sword
was returned to him without comment, and the evidence revealed
painful dissensions between the commander and some of his
captains.</p>
<p>The discouragement caused by this failure would, in any case,
no doubt have considerably cooled the Ministerial ardour for the
search; but, as it happened, the return of Sir Edward Belcher
coincided with the arrival of a highly important piece of
intelligence, which had the effect of reducing the temperature of
the official mind to zero. In the year 1853, Dr. Rae, whose share
in the earlier searches has already been recorded, proposed to
the Hudson's Bay Company to fit out a boat expedition for the
purpose of tracing the west coast of Boothia as far north as
Bellot Strait, and thus uniting the surveys of Sir James Ross
with those of Dease and Simpson. The proposal having been
accepted, Rae left England early in 1853, and in the course of
that and the following year accomplished the object of his
mission. The two surveys were united, and King William Land was
proved to be an island instead of being, as had been supposed, an
integral portion of the American continent. But in the course of
effecting this addition to geographical knowledge Rae made
another discovery of far more popular interest. An ironic destiny
had decreed that, after all the years that had been spent in
fruitless attempts to discover the fate of the Franklin
expedition, the first authentic intelligence of its disastrous
issue should have been obtained by an explorer engaged upon a
different service altogether.</p>
<p>In April 1854, Rae's sledge party, then in Pelly Bay, on the
coast of King William Land, happened upon some Eskimos, and from
these he obtained the first information detailed in the previous
chapter as to the fate of the Franklin expedition. Nor do the
particulars thus gleaned by him rest solely upon the memory or
veracity of his native informants. They were supported by
evidence of incontestable character in the shape of actual relics
of the missing men.</p>
<p>Justly considering that the information he had lighted upon
greatly outweighed the importance of the survey on which he had
been engaged, Dr. Rae hastened home to England, where he arrived
on October 22, 1854, and immediately proceeded to the Admiralty
with his report, the full text of which was also forwarded to the
'Times', and appeared in its columns on the following day. It
commences by a statement of the circumstances under which Rae had
lighted on his discoveries during the journey undertaken by him
over the ice and snow that spring, with the view of completing
the survey of the west shore of Boothia. In the course of this
journey 'I met', he says, 'with Eskimos in Pelly Bay, from one of
whom I learnt that a party of white men had perished from want of
food some distance to the westward, and not far beyond a large
river containing many falls and rapids. Subsequently, further
particulars were received, and a number of articles purchased,
which place the fate of a portion if not all of the then
survivors of the Franklin long-lost party beyond a doubt.'</p>
<p>Rae then went on to give the substance of the information
obtained by him at various times and from various sources, and
which was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>In the spring four winters past (spring 1850) a party
of white men amounting to about forty were seen dragging a boat
with them by some Eskimos who were killing seal near the north
shore of King William Land, which is a large island. None of the
party could speak the Eskimo language intelligibly, but by signs
the natives were made to understand that their ship or ships had
been crushed by ice, and that they were now going where they
expected to find deer to shoot. From the appearance of the men,
all of whom, except one officer, looked thin,* they were then
supposed to be getting short of provisions, and they purchased a
small seal from the natives. At a later date the same season, but
previously to the breaking up of the ice, the bodies of some
thirty persons were discovered on the continent and five on an
island near it, about a long day's journey to the NW. of a large
stream which can be no other than Back's Great Fish River, as its
description and that of the low shore in the neighbourhood of
Point Ogle and Montreal Island agree exactly with that of Sir
George Back. Some of the bodies had been buried (probably those
of the first victims of famine); some were in a tent or tents;
others under the boat, which had been turned over to form a
shelter, and several lay scattered about in different directions.
Of those found on the island, one was supposed to have been an
officer, as he had a telescope strapped over his shoulders and
his double-barrelled gun lay underneath him.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Owing no doubt to the haste in which this
statement had necessarily to be prepared for publication, a
mistake has here crept in. I am kindly permitted by Mrs. Rae, the
widow of the distinguished explorer, to quote the following
correction of it from her late husband's Journal: 'From the
appearance of the men, <i>all of whom looked so thin</i>, and
with the exception of an officer (chief) were hauling on the
drag-ropes of the sledges, they were supposed to be short of
provisions.']</p>
<p>There must, Rae thought, 'have been a number of watches,
compasses, telescopes, guns (several double-barrelled), &amp;c,
all of which appear to have been broken up, as I saw pieces of
these different articles with the Eskimos, and, together with
some silver spoons and forks, purchased as many as I could get'
These latter, of course, were by far the most important of all
the explorers' melancholy 'finds', for their armorial bearings
and initials stamped them as coming from the possession of the
perished officers of the expedition. Among I them was 'one round
silver plate, engraved "Sir John Franklin, K.C.B." (a mistake of
the engraver for K.C.H.), and 'a star or order with motto,
"<i>Nec aspera terrent</i>. G.R. III. MDCCCXV."'</p>
<p>The only point at which the accuracy of this information can
be questioned is that of the year in which the survivors of the
expedition were seen by the Eskimos. 'In the spring four winters
past', is an assignment of date which is in itself ambiguous; but
on no construction of it does it seem possible to accept it as
correct. Rae, as we have seen, interpreted it 'spring 1850', but
further consideration satisfied him that his informants had
mistaken the date; and it is indeed incredible that any members
of a party which had abandoned their ships in such extremities in
April 1848 could have been still alive two years afterwards.</p>
<p>There is, however, not much difficulty in supposing that the
Eskimo recollections of the precise year were at fault. Dr. Rae,
indeed, records a curious instance of their defective memory for
dates; for they declared that an interview which he had had with
them in 1847 had taken place 'five' instead of seven years
before. But, in any case, no difficulty of this description could
detract from the value of the silent testimony above described.
In whatever year the explorers had perished, there could be no
longer any doubt as to their fate. Proof of it had come at a
moment when almost every one regarded such proof as impossible.
Fate, indeed, remained ironical to the last. A leading article in
the 'Times' of Saturday, October 21,1854, contained the following
sentence:&mdash;'It would have been well-nigh as reasonable to
look for the discovery of La P&eacute;rouse' (lost seventy years
before) 'as for any traces of poor Franklin and his followers.'
Within forty-eight hours from the publication of these words Dr.
Rae's 'copy' was in the 'Times' office, and in the next issue of
the paper his statement was given to the world.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>
<p align="center">THE 'RECORD' FOUND<br>
<br>
1854-1859</p>
<p><small>THE</small> effect upon the Government of this
important change in the situation was such as those acquainted
with Governments would have expected. A reward of 10,000<i>l</i>.
had been already offered by them to any one bringing the first
information of the fate of the Franklin expedition; and Rae, who
had made his discoveries and returned to England in complete
ignorance of the fact, derived his first knowledge of
it&mdash;together, significantly enough, with a suggestion that
he should apply for the reward&mdash;from the First Lord of the
Admiralty himself. He and his party, said Sir James Graham, were
entitled to it, and 'he would stand in his own light if he did
not put in a claim for it.'</p>
<p>Beyond all doubt it had been fairly earned. The intelligence
which Rae had brought home with him, attested as it was by the
mute evidence of the relics in his possession, undeniably
answered the description of authentic 'first information of the
fate of the Franklin expedition.' But the question whether Rae
was entitled to the reward promised for it was quite distinct
from the question whether the Government were entitled to
interpret 'first' as equivalent to 'final and complete'
information, and justified in abandoning all further efforts to
supplement it. But the Admiralty was in want not so much of a
justification as of a plausible excuse. The failure of Sir Edward
Belcher's costly expedition, and the abandonment of four fine
ships of the Navy&mdash;one of which, however, the Resolute, was
later on, after an almost miraculous drift in the ice-pack into
Baffin's Bay, recovered by the American Government, and presented
to our own&mdash;had been 'a heavy blow and sore discouragement'
to the hopes and expectations not only of the Government but of
the public at large. The country was engaged in a European war,
the cost of which was accumulating in rapidly mounting millions;
and on the whole we cannot wonder that the Ministerial mind
should have been quick to seize on what must have seemed an
unexpectedly happy chance of getting quit of a troublesome
business. The ten thousand pounds reward had been so fully and
fairly earned by Dr. Rae, that they felt they would have a good
answer to Parliamentary and other critics; and to pay it over to
him promptly would be purchasing their relief from further calls
upon the Exchequer at a comparatively cheap rate.</p>
<p>To Lady Franklin this view of their duty was far from
commending itself. To her it seemed that 'information as to the
fate' of her husband and his companions, or such information as
the country ought alone to be satisfied with, should be of a more
definite character than a story gathered from the lips of
wandering Eskimos, even supported, as no doubt this was, by
morally conclusive proof of the fact&mdash;which, indeed, hardly
needed proving nine years after the departure of the
explorers&mdash;that they had all perished. Some light on the
causes which led to the loss of the ships, and on the time and
manner of the deaths of their gallant commander and their
crews&mdash;it was this for which Lady Franklin craved, and for
which in her devotion to her husband's memory, and her pride in
his achievements, she firmly believed and maintained that her
countrymen were craving also. She had already fitted out four
ships almost entirely at her own expense, and, as the event
proved, she had no thought of shrinking from further sacrifices
in the same cause. But she held, as, indeed, did the naval and
scientific world in general, that only an expedition furnished
with the appliances and supported by the resources at the command
of the Government had any chance of attaining the desired end.
Protesting, therefore, against the payment of the reward to Dr.
Rae&mdash;at any rate, as definitively exhausting Ministerial
responsibility in the matter&mdash;she laboured untiringly during
the next two years to bring the Government to a sense of their
duty to the nation.</p>
<p>She was not without warm support from the leading scientific
men of the day, and from naval officers who had distinguished
themselves in Arctic service. On Junes, 1856, a memorial, signed
by many names of the highest weight in the world of science and
of exploring adventure, was presented to Lord Palmerston, new at
that time in the office of Prime Minister, urging the necessity
of further research 'to satisfy the honour of our country and to
clear up a mystery which has excited the sympathy of the
civilised world.' And some months later the prayer of this
memorial was further emphasised by the following dignified and
touching letter to the Prime Minister from Lady Franklin
herself:&mdash;</p>
<p align="right" class="quote"><small>60 Pall Mall: Dec. 2,
1856.</small>   </p>
<blockquote>My Lord,&mdash;I trust I may be permitted, as the
widow of Sir John Franklin, to draw the attention of Her
Majesty's Government to the unsettled state of a question which a
few weeks ago was under their consideration, and to express a
well-grounded hope that a final effort may be made to ascertain
the fate and recover the remains of my husband's expedition.<br>
<br>
Your Lordship will allow me to remind you that a memorial with
this object in view (of which I enclose a printed copy) was early
in June last presented to and kindly received by you. It had been
signed within forty-eight hours by all the leading men of science
then in London who had an opportunity of seeing it, and might
have received an indefinite augmentation of worthy names, had not
the urgency of the question forbidden delay. To the above names
were appended those of the Arctic officers who had been
personally engaged in the search, and who, though absent, were
known to be favourable to another effort for its completion. And
though that united application obtained no immediate result, it
was felt, and by no one more strongly than myself, that it never
could be utterly wasted.<br>
<br>
I venture also to allude to a letter of my own, addressed to the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty in April last, and a copy of
which accompanied, I believe, the memorial to your Lordship,
wherein I earnestly deprecated the premature adjudication of the
reward claimed by Dr. Rae, on the ground that the fate of my
husband's expedition was not yet ascertained, and that it was due
both to the living and the dead to complete a search which had
hitherto been pursued under the greatest disadvantage for want of
the clue which was now for the first time in our hands. . . . The
memorialists had, as yet, received no reply, and accordingly the
President of the Royal Society put a question respecting the
memorial in the House of Lords at the close of the session, which
drew from one of Her Majesty's Ministers (Lord Stanley), after
some preliminary observations, the assurance that Her Majesty's
Government would give the subject their serious consideration
during the recess. I may be permitted to add that, in the
conversation which followed, Lord Stanley expressed himself very
favourably disposed towards the proposition made to him by Lord
Wrottesley, that in the event of there being no Government
expedition, I should be assisted in fitting out my own
expedition; an assurance which Lord Wrottesley had the kindness
to communicate to me by letter. ... I have cherished the hope, in
common with others, that we are not waiting in vain. Should,
however, the decision of the Government unfortunately throw upon
me the responsibility and the cost of sending out a vessel
myself, I beg to assure your Lordship that I shall not shrink
either from that weighty responsibility or from the sacrifice of
my entire available fortune for the purpose, supported as I am in
my convictions by such high authorities as those whose opinions
are on record in your Lordship's hands, and by the hearty
sympathy of many more.<br>
<br>
But before I take upon myself so heavy an obligation, it is my
bounden duty to entreat Her Majesty's Government not to disregard
the arguments which have led so many competent and honourable men
to feel that our country's honour is not satisfied while a
mystery which has excited the sympathy of the civilised world
remains uncleared. Nor less would I entreat you to consider what
must be the unsatisfactory consequences if any endeavour should
be made to quench all further efforts for this object.<br>
<br>
It cannot be that the long-vexed question would thereby be set at
rest, for it would still be true that, in a certain circumscribed
area of the Arctic circle, approachable alike from the east and
from the west, and sure to be attained by a combination of both
movements, lies the solution of our unhappy countrymen's fate.
While such is the case, the question will never die. I believe
that again and again efforts would be made to reach the spot, and
that the Government could not look on as unconcerned spectators,
nor be relieved, in public opinion, of the responsibility they
had prematurely cast off. . . .<br>
<br>
It would be a waste of words to attempt to refute again the main
objections that have been urged against a renewed search as
involving extraordinary dangers and risking life. The safe return
of our officers and men cannot be denied, neither will it be
disputed that each succeeding year diminishes the risk of
casualty; and, indeed, I feel it would be especially superfluous
and unseasonable to argue against this particular objection, or
against the financial one which generally accompanies it, at a
moment when new expeditions for the glorious interests of
science, and which every true lover of science and of his country
must rejoice in, are contemplated for the interior of Africa and
other parts which are less favourable to human life than the icy
regions of the North. . . . Even were the expenditure greater
than can reasonably be expected, I submit to your Lordship that
this is a case of no ordinary exigency. These 135 men of the
Erebus and Terror (or, perhaps, I should rather say the greater
part of them, since we do not yet know that there are no
survivors) have laid down their lives, after sufferings doubtless
of unexampled severity, in the service of their country as truly
as if they had perished by the rifle, the cannon ball, or the
bayonet. Nay, more; by attaining the northern and already
surveyed coasts of America, it is clear that they solved the
problem which was the object of their labour, or, in the
beautiful words of Sir John Richardson, that 'they forged the
last link of the North-west Passage with their lives.'<br>
<br>
Surely, then, I may plead for such men that a careful search be
made for any possible survivor, that the bones of the dead be
sought for and gathered together, that their buried records be
unearthed or recovered from the hands of the Eskimos, and, above
all, that their last written words, so precious to their bereaved
families and friends, be saved from destruction. A mission so
sacred is worthy of a Government which has grudged and spared
nothing for its heroic soldiers and sailors in other fields of
warfare, and will surely be approved by our gracious Queen, who
overlooks none of her loyal subjects suffering and dying for
their country's honour.<br>
<br>
The final and exhaustive search is all I seek on behalf of the
first and only martyrs to Arctic discovery in modern times, and
it is all I ever intend to ask.<br>
<br>
But if, notwithstanding all I have presumed to urge, Her
Majesty's Government decline to complete the work they have
carried on up to this critical moment, but leave it to private
hands to finish, I must then respectfully request that measure of
assistance which I have been led to expect on the authority of
Lord Stanley as communicated to me by Lord Wrottesley, and on
that of the first Lord of the Admiralty as communicated to
Colonel Phipps in a letter in my possession.<br>
<br>
It is with no desire to avert from myself the sacrifice of my own
funds, which I devote without reserve to the object in view, that
I plead for a liberal interpretation of those communications; but
I owe it to the conscientious and high-minded Arctic officers who
have generously offered me their services that my expedition
should be made as efficient as possible, however restricted it
may be in extent. The Admiralty, I feel sure, will not deny me
what may be necessary for the purpose, since, if I do all I can
with my own means, any deficiencies and shortcomings of a private
expedition cannot, I think, be laid to my charge. . . .<br>
<br>
I commit the prayer of this letter, for the length of which I
must beg much to apologise, to your Lordship's patient and kind
consideration, feeling assured that, however the words of it may
fall upon the ear of some who apparently judge of it neither by
the heart nor by the head, you will not on that, or on any light
ground, hastily dismiss it. Rather may you be impelled to feel
that the shortest and surest way to set the unfortunate question
at rest is to submit it to that final investigation which will
satisfy the yearnings of surviving relatives and friends and,
what is justly of higher import to your Lordship, the credit and
honour of the country.<br>

FRANKLIN.</small>   </p>
<blockquote>The Right Hon. Viscount Palmerston,
<small>K.G.</small></blockquote>
<p>No final answer was given to this eloquent appeal for another
three months; but in April, 1857, Sir Charles Wood, the First
Lord of the Admiralty, wrote informing Lady Franklin that the
members of Her Majesty's Government 'having come with great
regret to the conclusion that there was no prospect of saving
life, would not be justified, for any objects which, in their
opinion, could be obtained by an expedition to the Arctic seas,
in exposing the lives of officers and men to the risks
inseparable from such an enterprise.'</p>
<p>On receipt of this answer the devoted widow lost not a moment
in taking independent action. She immediately entered into
negotiations for the purchase of a screw steam-yacht. By the
middle of the month she had written to Captain McClintock to take
command of the expedition, and in less than a week she was able
to telegraph to him, 'Your leave is granted; the Fox is mine; the
refit will commence immediately.' The Fox was immediately placed
in the hands of her builders to be strengthened and adapted to
Arctic service, with the intention of getting her ready to sail
by July I. Provisions for twenty-eight months were embarked,
including preserved vegetables, lemon juice, and pickles for
daily consumption, and preserved meats for every third day; also
as much of the 'stoutest ale' as room could be found for. The
Government, to do them justice, did their best to atone for their
refusal to despatch another expedition of their own by
'contributing liberally', wrote Captain McClintock, 'to our
supplies. All our arms, powder, shot, powder for ice-blasting,
rockets, maroons, and signal-mortars were furnished by the Board
of Ordnance. The Admiralty caused 6,682 lbs. of pemmican to be
prepared for our use.' They 'supplied us with all the requisite
ice gear, such as saws from ten to eighteen feet in length,
ice-anchors and ice-claws; also with our winter housing,
medicines, seamen's library, hydrographical instruments, charts,
chronometers, and an ample supply of Arctic clothing, which had
remained in store from former expeditions. The Board of Trade
contributed a variety of meteorological and nautical instruments
and journals, and I found that I had but to ask of these
departments for what was required, and if in store it was at once
granted.' The President of the Royal Society voted 50<i>l</i>.
from their donation fund for the purchase of magnetic and other
scientific instruments. The expenses of fitting out the
expedition, including the original purchase-cost of the yacht,
2,000<i>l</i>., amounted to some 6,000<i>l</i>., of which,
however, about half was met by private subscription, the list of
subscribers containing many well-known and interesting names.
Thackeray figures in it as a contributor. Dickens had
energetically supported Lady Franklin's appeal to the Government
through his then newly founded periodical, <i>Household
Words</i>. The crew, all told, numbered only twenty-six souls.
Captain McClintock's second in command was Lieutenant Hobson,
R.N., and with him was associated Captain (now Sir Allen) Young,
then of the mercantile marine, who was an enthusiast for Arctic
exploration, and who had not only subscribed handsomely to the
expedition, but had actually abandoned a lucrative appointment to
accept a subordinate post in it. Thus manned and provisioned this
little yacht of 170 tons went forth to achieve a work which had
baffled the efforts of many powerful ships of the navy, with all
the resources of a great maritime department at their backs.</p>
<p>The Fox was punctually got ready for sea by the day fixed, and
two days before that date Lady Franklin wrote to her captain what
he described as 'the only written instruction he could ever
prevail upon her to give him', in the following admirable
letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>My dear Captain McClintock,&mdash;You have kindly
invited me to give you 'Instructions', but I cannot bring myself
to feel that it would be right in any way to influence your
judgment in the conduct of your noble undertaking; and, indeed, I
have no temptation to do so, since it appears to me that your
views are almost identical with those which I had independently
formed before I became thoroughly possessed of yours. But had
this been otherwise, I trust you would have found me ready to
prove the implicit confidence I place in you by yielding my own
views to your more enlightened judgment; knowing, too, as I do,
that your whole heart also is in the cause, even as my own is. As
to the objects of the expedition and their relative importance, I
am sure you know that the rescue of any possible survivor of the
Erebus and Terror would be to me, as it would be to you, the
noblest result of our efforts.<br>
<br>
To this object I would wish every other to be subordinate; and
next to it in importance is the recovery of the unspeakably
precious documents of the expedition, public and private, and the
personal relics of my dear husband and his companions.<br>
<br>
And, lastly, I trust it may be in your power to confirm directly
or inferentially the claim of my husband's expedition to the
earliest discovery of the passage which, if Dr. Rae's report be
true (and the Government of our country has already accepted and
rewarded it as such), these martyrs in a noble cause achieved at
their last extremity after five long years of labour and
suffering, if not at an earlier period.<br>
<br>
I am sure you will do all that man can do for the attainment of
all these objects; my only fear is that you may spend yourselves
too much in the effort, and you must, therefore, let me tell you
how much dearer to me even than them is the preservation of the
valuable lives of the little band of heroes who are your
companions and followers.<br>
<br>
May God in His great mercy preserve you all from harm amid the
labours and perils which await you, and restore you to us in
health and safety as well as in honour! As to the honour, I can
have <i>no</i> misgiving. It will be yours as much if you fail
(since you <i>may</i> fail in spite of every effort) as if you
succeed; and be assured that under <i>any and all circumstances
whatever</i>, such is my unbounded confidence in you, you will
possess and be entitled to the enduring gratitude of your sincere
and attached friend,</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="right"><small>JANE
FRANKLIN.</small>   </p>
<p>The first year's voyage of the gallant little yacht was
unfortunate. All went well till she reached Melville Bay; but, in
attempting to cross it, she found her way blocked by large masses
of ice, though it was still but mid-August, and in a few days she
was fast beset&mdash;and McClintock had to face the grim prospect
of passing the very first winter of the expedition in the pack.
For no less a period than 242 days the Fox was frozen fast, and
drifted helplessly to the southward for nearly 1,200 geographical
miles. It was not till April 25, 1858, that she was released from
the grasp of the ice, and, again pushing northward, succeeded
this time in crossing the bay and effecting an entrance into
Lancaster Sound.</p>
<p>Beechey Island was their first destination, and this they
reached in the month of August, bringing with them a marble
tablet, which had been sent out by Lady Franklin with an American
search party for erection at the first winter quarters of her
husband's expedition, but which the Americans, prevented by
circumstances from executing their mission, had been obliged to
bring back with them and deposit at Godhavn in Disco. The
inscription is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>This tablet Captain McClintock duly erected 'upon the raised
flagged square in the centre of which stands the cenotaph
recording the names of those who perished in the Government
expedition under Sir Edward Belcher.'</p>
<p>Quitting Beechey Island in the middle of August, McClintock
entered Peel Sound, but only to find, after steaming down it for
some five-and-twenty miles, that his way was impassably blocked
by ice. He was accordingly forced to retrace his course to Barrow
Strait, and to try a southward route by Prince Regent Inlet
instead of that by way of Peel Sound. Down this new channel they
accordingly proceeded, and, after a perilous adventure in the
floating ice, which came near to dashing her on the rocks, the
little yacht succeeded in making her way westward through Bellot
Strait, and was, at the end of September, 1858, laid up snugly
enough in winter quarters at Port Kennedy&mdash;a haven lighted
upon by McClintock at the eastern end of the strait, and named by
him after the original discoverers of the waterway.</p>
<p>The winter was spent in making arrangements for the thorough
exploration of the coast of Boothia as the first work of the
following spring. It was a winter of extraordinary severity, the
thermometer ranging on Christmas Day from 76&deg; to 80&deg;
below freezing-point, and the mean temperature for the month of
December being as low as -33&deg;&mdash;only 6&deg; above the
freezing-point of mercury. In January and February the weather
still continued abnormally cold, even for these regions; but on
the 17th of the latter month it was thought to have sufficiently
moderated to allow of the expedition's starting out, and on that
day McClintock and his sledge party set out for Cape
Victoria.</p>
<p>Early in March they reached an Eskimo village, from the
inhabitants of which they obtained some news and several relics
of the lost expedition. Among the latter were some spoons and
forks, a silver medal, part of a gold chain, several buttons, and
knives made of the iron and wood of the wreck, as well as bows
and arrows fashioned out of material obtained from the same
source.</p>
<p>None of the Eskimo had seen any of the expedition, though one
averred that he had 'seen their bones upon the island where they
died.' He was understood to say that the boat was crushed by the
ice. On the following day, however, more definite information was
obtained. An Eskimo from whom they bought a spear told their
interpreter distinctly that a ship having three masts had been
crushed by the ice out in the sea to the west of King William
Island; but that all the people landed safely; he was not one of
those who were eyewitnesses of it; the ship sank, so nothing was
obtained by the natives from her; all that they have got', he
said, 'came from an island in the river.' The spear staff
appeared to have been made from the gunwale of a light boat. This
information substantially bore out the reports of Dr. Rae, and
accounted for the disappearance of one of the ships; but it gave
no clue to the whereabouts of the other, nor to the direction
whence they came. One thing, however, it rendered tolerably
certain, namely, that the crews did not at any time land on the
shore of Boothia.</p>
<p>McClintock now returned to the yacht, having in his
twenty-five days' journey travelled 420 English miles and
completed the discovery of the coast line of continental America,
adding thereby 120 miles to our charts. On reaching the Fox he
assembled his little crew and acquainted them with the results of
his expedition, went on to point out that there still remained
one of the ships unaccounted for, and that, therefore, it was
necessary to carry out all the projected lines of search.</p>
<p>On April 2 McClintock and Lieutenant Hobson started off again,
upon what, in the case of the latter officer, was to be the
eventful journey of the expedition. King William Island,
practically the only land not yet examined in which search seemed
at all likely to be rewarded, was the object in view. By the end
of the month they had reached Cape Victoria, where they
separated, Hobson marching direct for Cape Felix, while
McClintock kept on a more southerly course. Though less important
as regards its 'finds' than that of his comrade (to whom, indeed,
he is understood to have generously yielded the most promising
field of search with a view to procuring him his promotion),
McClintock's journey was far from being fruitless. In the course
of it he succeeded in acquiring many relics of the Franklin
party, and covering, as he did, the whole of the west shore of
King William Island, and making his way thence to the ice at the
entrance of the Great Fish River, he had the satisfaction of
knowing that he had traversed the whole route taken by Franklin's
unfortunate followers, and that, had they left behind them any
cairn or other record of their passage, he could not have failed
to discover them. Montreal Island having been carefully examined,
McClintock crossed over to the mainland in the neighbourhood of
Point Duncan, and on May 19 set out on his return journey.</p>
<p>It seemed then as though it were vain to hope for the
discovery of any traces of the missing men themselves. McClintock
had already satisfied himself, from his interrogation of the
Eskimos, that the wreck of one of the ships, or rather its last
fragments, might still be seen at a point off the west coast of
King William Island, but nearly all of it had been carried off by
the natives, and it was probable that the five days' journey
necessary to reach it would not be adequately repaid. Still, it
was evident that nothing was to be gained by pushing further to
the south, and the only course open to McClintock was to retrace
his steps. Regaining the shore of Simpson Strait some miles to
the west of Point Richardson, the party crossed over to King
William Island, and took their way along the south coast, making
for Cape Herschel. Here their first grim discovery awaited
them.</p>
<blockquote>We were now upon the shore, along which the
retreating crews must have marched. My sledges, of course,
travelled upon the sea-ice close along the shore; and although
the depth of snow which covered the beach deprived us of almost
every hope, yet we kept a very sharp look-out for traces, nor
were we unsuccessful. Shortly after midnight of May 25, when
slowly walking along a gravel ridge near the beach which the
winds kept partially bare of snow, I came upon a human skeleton,
partly exposed, with here and there a few fragments of clothing
appearing through the snow. The skeleton&mdash;now perfectly
bleached&mdash;was lying upon its face, the limbs and smaller
bones either dissevered or gnawed away by small animals.<br>
<br>
A most careful examination of the spot was, of course, made, the
snow removed and every scrap of clothing gathered up. A
pocketbook afforded strong grounds for hope that some information
might be subsequently obtained respecting the unfortunate crews
and the calamitous march of the lost crews, but at the time it
was frozen hard.</blockquote>
<p>It was brought home to England and every effort made to
decipher the letters found in it; but only a few detached
sentences could be made out, and these not referring to the
proceedings of the expedition.</p>
<blockquote>The victim was a young man, slightly built and
perhaps above the common height; the dress appeared to be that of
a steward or officer's servant, the loose bow-knot in which his
neck handkerchief was tied not being used by seamen or officers.
In every particular the dress confirmed our conjectures as to his
rank or office in the late expedition&mdash;the blue jacket with
slashed sleeves and braided edging, and the pilot cloth greatcoat
with plain covered buttons. We also found a clothes brush near
and a horn pocket-comb. This poor man seems to have selected the
bare ridge top as affording the least tiresome walking, and to
have fallen upon his face in the position in which we found
him.</blockquote>
<p>A melancholy commentary on the words of the old Eskimo woman,
'They fell down and died as they walked along.' The cairn erected
by Simpson in 1839 at Cape Herschel was then inspected; but
though McClintock was then and afterwards convinced that the
doomed men had left some record, he found nothing, and he
believes&mdash;a belief y confirmed by the displacement
noticeable in the stones of the cairn&mdash;that the deposit,
whatever it was, had been removed by the Eskimos. Twelve miles
beyond Cape Herschel he was met by the joyful intelligence that,
thanks to the keen eyes and good fortune of his comrade, their
mission had attained its end&mdash;the discovery of a written
record under the hand of the lost. Beneath a cairn which Hobson
had erected as its depository, McClintock found a paper left for
him by his comrade, informing him of the discovery of Graham
Gore's record at Point Victory, the contents of which have
already been set out. Its importance, of course, could hardly be
overestimated; for not only did it virtually confirm the reports
received from the Eskimos as to the fate of the expedition, but
it fixed the precise date and place of Sir John Franklin's death,
and conveyed to his widow the melancholy consolation of the
assurance that he had been mercifully spared the long-drawn agony
which his surviving comrades must have endured.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Hobson's note contained the further information
that he had found quantities of clothing and articles of all
kinds lying about the cairn, as if the unhappy men, aware that
they were retreating for their lives, had there abandoned
everything which they considered superfluous.</p>
<p>On May 29 McClintock and his party reached the westernmost
point of King William Island, which he named after Captain
Crozier. Thence the coast line was found to turn sharply away to
the eastward, and, following it, the party encamped early on the
morning of May 30 alongside a large boat, another sad relic of
the expedition, which Hobson had found and examined a few days
before; but he had failed to discover record, journal,
pocket-book, or memorandum of any description. This boat, which
was mounted on a sledge of unusual weight and strength,
McClintock afterwards carefully examined, but for the moment they
were in no mood for minute observation, 'for there was that in
the boat which transfixed us with awe.' It contained portions of
two human skeletons.</p>
<blockquote>One was that of a slight young person, the other of a
large, strongly made, middle-aged man. The former was found in
the bow of the boat, but in too disturbed a state to enable
Hobson to judge whether the sufferer had died there. Large and
powerful animals, probably wolves, had destroyed much of the
skeleton, which may have been that of an officer. Near it we
found the fragment of a pair of worked slippers . . . the lines
white with a red margin; the spaces red, white, and yellow. They
had originally been eleven inches long, lined with calfskin with
the hair left on, and the edges bound with red silk ribbon.
Besides these slippers there were a pair of small, strong
shooting half-boots. The other skeleton was in a more perfect
state, and was enveloped with clothes and furs; it lay across the
boat under the after thwart. Close beside it were found five
watches, two double-barrelled guns, one barrel in each loaded and
cocked, standing muzzle upwards towards the boat's side. It may
be imagined with what deep interest these sad relics were
scrutinised, and how anxiously every fragment of clothing was
turned over in search of pockets and pocket-books, journals, or
even names. Five or six small books were found, all of them
scriptural or devotional works, except the 'Vicar of Wakefield'.
One little book, 'Christian Melodies', bore an inscription on the
title-page, from the donor to G.G. (Graham Gore?). A small Bible
contained numerous marginal notes, and whole passages underlined.
Besides these books, the covers of a New Testament and Prayer
Book were found.</blockquote>
<p>Unhappily, too, the boat contained ominous evidences of that
terrible overloading of the sledges, which Sherard Osborn had had
cause to suspect from the signs discovered by him at Beechey
Island. Among an amazing quantity of clothing and toilet
articles, McClintock found 'twine, nails, saws, files, bristles,
waxends, sailmakers' palms, powder, bullets, shot, cartridges,
wads, leather cartridge-cases, knives&mdash;clasp and dinner
ones&mdash;needle and thread cases, slow match, several bayonet
scabbards cut down into knife sheaths, two rolls of sheet lead,
and, in short, a quantity of articles of one description and
another truly astonishing in variety, and such as, for the most
part, modern sledge travellers in these regions would consider a
mere accumulation of dead weight, but slightly useful and very
likely to break down the strength of the sledge crews.'</p>
<p>The only provisions found in the boat were a small quantity of
tea and nearly forty pounds of chocolate. These articles alone
would, of course, have been insufficient to support life in an
Arctic temperature; but neither biscuit nor meat of any kind was
found. There was, however, no lack of fuel, for a drift tree was
lying on the beach close at hand, where it had probably lain for
twenty or thirty years. In the after part of the boat were
discovered a number of spoons and forks marked with the initials
or crests of various officers of the expedition, eight of them
bearing the crest of Sir John Franklin, and having been probably,
McClintock conjectures, issued to the men, as the only means of
saving them, as relics of the lost commander. No doubt, indeed,
the other officers did the same with their own plate, as not a
single iron spoon such as sailors always use was found.</p>
<p>The most surprising thing to the discoverers was the position
of the sledge on which the boat was cradled. It was turned
towards the N.E., or in the reverse direction to the line of
retreat. The spot at which it was discovered was about 50 miles
as a sledge would travel from Point Victory, and therefore 65
miles from the position of the abandoned ships. On the other
hand, it was 70 miles from the skeleton of the steward and 150
miles from Montreal Island, the limit of McClintock's southward
search. Moreover, it was in the depth of a wide bay, where, by
crossing over 10 or 12 miles of very low land, instead of
following the indentation of the coast, a saving of some 40 miles
would be effected.</p>
<blockquote>A little reflection led me to satisfy my own mind, at
least, that the boat was returning to the ship; and in no other
way can I account for two men having been left in her, than by
supposing the party were unable to drag the boat further, and
that these two men, not being able to keep pace with their
shipmates, were therefore left by them, supplied with such
provisions as could be spared to last until the return of the
others from the ship with a fresh stock.<br>
<br>
Whether it was the intention of the retroceding party to await
the result of another season in the ships, or to follow the track
of the main body to the Great Fish River, is more a matter of
conjecture. It seems highly probable that they had purposed
revisiting the boat, not only on account of the two men left in
charge of it, but also to obtain the chocolate, the five watches,
and many other articles which would otherwise scarcely have been
left in her.<br>
<br>
The same reasons which may be assigned for the return of the
detachment from the main body will also serve to account for
their not having come back to their boat. In both instances they
appear to have greatly overrated their strength and the distance
they could travel in a given time.</blockquote>
<p>Whether all or any of the remainder of this detached party
ever reached their ships is uncertain. It seems clear, at any
rate, that none of them returned to the boat, or other skeletons
would have been discovered in the neighbourhood; and if the
Eskimos spoke the truth in declaring that but one human body was
found on board the ship that drifted on shore, the inference is
that the remainder of the sledge party, probably some twenty or
thirty men, must have perished in the attempt to traverse those
fifty miles of land which lay between them and the ships, and
that the Arctic wolves had left no trace of their remains.</p>
<p>A duplicate of Gore's record, deposited in 1847, was found by
Lieutenant Hobson on the south side of Back Bay; that is, on the
opposite shore of the inlet to that in which the
former&mdash;for, being at a point somewhat nearer the place in
which the ships were beset, we may suppose it to have been the
earlier deposit of the two&mdash;was discovered. It of course
adds nothing to our information, and is only interesting as
showing the same mistake as its companion paper with reference to
the year in which the Erebus and Terror wintered at Beechey
Island. Both papers had evidently been filled in and sealed up at
the same time, and that this was before Graham Gore left the
ships is to be inferred from the fact that neither seems to have
originally borne any entry of the date at which they were
<i>deposited</i>. When, the year afterward, the record was opened
by the retreating party, this date, May 28, was filled in by
Captain Fitzjames, as may be gathered from the colour of the ink,
which resembles that of Fitzjames's marginal additions and not
that of Graham Gore's original entries. The ascertainment of this
point has an importance which McClintock hardly seems to have
attached to it when he composed his narrative; for, incidentally,
it proves that Graham Gore's party, or some of them, made their
way back safely to the ships with the news, as we may fairly
assume, of their having sighted the wished-for shores and waters.
This would not have been proved by the mere circumstance that
Crozier and Fitzjames seem to have known the whereabouts of
Gore's record, for it might have been arranged before he started
that a cairn should be erected and a record left on the first
point of land which he reached after traversing the ice-pack. But
it would have been impossible for the shipmates whom Gore and his
party left behind them to have known the exact date at which they
reached Point Victory, unless some of them had returned with a
full report of their journey and its results.</p>
<p>The two papers had been soldered up in tin cylinders, but when
discovered they were already much damaged by rust, and in a very
few years would have been illegible. The cylinder opened by
Fitzjames to get at the paper within and add to it the
information which gives it its principal value, had not been
soldered up again. Probably the retreating party had not the
means of doing so. It was found on the ground among some loose
stones which had evidently fallen from the top of the cairn. Its
preservation under the circumstances was providential. Indeed,
its very existence is a matter for congratulation, for it does
not seem to have been intended, in McClintock's opinion, that any
record at all should be deposited after the abandonment of the
ships; and our gratitude to the men who left it 'ought', he adds,
'to be all the greater when we remember that the ink had to be
thawed, and that writing in a tent during an April day in the
Arctic regions is by no means an easy task.'</p>
<p>A great quantity and variety of things lay strewn about the
cairn, in further lamentable testimony to the disastrous
overloading of the party&mdash;articles such as it had evidently
been found impossible to carry further than the short distance of
fifteen miles, which was all that the party had then covered.
'Among these were four heavy sets of boat's cooking stoves,
pickaxes, shovels, iron hoops, old canvas, a large single block,
about four feet of a copper lightning rod, long pieces of hollow
brass curtain rods, a small case of selected medicines containing
about twenty-four phials, the contents in a wonderful state of
preservation', and certain nautical and magnetic instruments. The
clothing left by the party formed 'a huge heap four feet high;
every article was searched, but the pockets were empty and not
one of all these articles was marked.'</p>
<p>Two other cairns and many relics were found by Hobson to the
north of this position, and though throwing no further direct
light on the fate of the expedition, they were indirectly
valuable as showing that no part of the coast between Cape Felix
and Cape Crozier had been visited by Eskimos since the landing of
the crews in 1848. None of the cairns had been disturbed, nor had
any of the numerous articles strewn about, which would be
invaluable to the natives, been touched. Hence it may be
confidently inferred that the evidence of the Eskimos as to 'the
white men falling and dying as they walked along' applies only to
the shore line southward and eastward from Cape Crozier, where,
of course, no traces of them were permitted by these eyewitnesses
of their death to remain. 'It is not probable that such fearful
mortality would have overtaken them so early in their march as
within eighty miles by sledge route from the abandoned
ships&mdash;such being their distance from Cape Crozier; nor is
it probable that we could have passed the wreck had she existed
there, as there are no off-lying islands to prevent a ship
drifting in upon the beach, while to the southward they are very
numerous, so much so that a drifting ship could hardly run the
gauntlet between them so as to reach the shore.'</p>
<br>
<p>McClintock's mission was now fully accomplished. He had set at
rest all doubts as to the fate of the expedition; he had obtained
for the widow of its gallant commander the conclusive evidence so
long sought, so passionately yet patiently striven for, of the
time and manner of her husband's death; and, finally, he had
brought back with him what she hardly less valued, definitive
proof that Franklin and his companions were actually the first to
discover, though not to accomplish in their ships, the passage
from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. The bows of the gallant
little Fox might now be turned homeward; her two years' battle
with the Arctic seas was over, and she would winter in more
hospitable waters.</p>
<p>By the end of July they had reached Godhavn on their southward
journey, where letters from England reached them. Lady Franklin
and Miss Cracroft had both written to Captain McClintock in the
previous March. They had travelled, as he remarks, even 'more
than we have, having visited almost all the countries bordering
the Mediterranean and Black Seas, posted through the Crimea, and
steamed up the Danube.' Nineteen days later McClintock landed at
Portsmouth and reported himself to the Admiralty. The Arctic
medal was presented to such of the crew as had not already
received it for Arctic service. A month later the commander of
the expedition received the official acknowledgment from the
Admiralty of 'the important services' performed by him 'in
bringing home the only authentic intelligence of the death of the
late Sir John Franklin, and of the fate of the crews of the
Erebus and Terror.' And in the year following, Her Majesty, by
conferring upon Captain McClintock the honour of knighthood,
which the gallant officer still lives to enjoy, expressed her
just appreciation of what was not the least brilliant of those
Arctic exploits which have added lustre to her reign.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>
<p align="center">A DEVOTED WIDOWHOOD<br>
<br>
1859-1875</p>
<p><small>LADY FRANKLIN'S</small> task was done. The self-imposed
duty to which she had devoted so many long years of yearning, and
of the heart-sickness of hope deferred, was at last accomplished.
Few, save herself, had been found to believe, during the latter
part of the period, that it was possible. There was proof enough,
thought the world in general, that her gallant husband and his
companions were all dead. Had not authentic and unmistakable
relics of the ill-fated band been brought home by Dr. Rae,
including some at least, such as Franklin's own decorations of
honour, which it was certain that their owner would never have
parted with while life remained. What more was needed? Was it
proof of the time and manner of that death of which only the bare
fact had been established? But such proof might never have
existed at all. Circumstances might have prevented the lost
explorers from leaving behind them any record of their
adventures, or of the deaths by which their party had been
thinned. Even if they had done so, how shadowy was the hope that
that record was still in existence! Why should not the wandering
Eskimos, into whose hands all the other relics had fallen, have
obtained possession of this also? And if they had, was it not
certain that they would have destroyed it or thrown it away as
worthless? Was there any use in spending more and more money and
risking more and more valuable lives in so visionary a chase?</p>
<p>So spoke, of course, the world of 'common-sense', and in tones
which naturally gained in decision and emphasis with every year
that passed, especially after Dr. Rae's discoveries had satisfied
every one of the fact of death. There was nothing to oppose to it
but the love, the devotion, the unquenchable faith of one
solitary woman. She had clung long after others had abandoned it
to the belief that her husband was still living; and when this
hope was abandoned, and she had, as we have seen, to appeal to
the Government in the avowed character of Sir John Franklin's
'widow', she was then to cling with equal tenacity to the
conviction, long relinquished by others, that somewhere, beneath
some undiscovered cairn on the frozen coasts of Arctic America,
lay the precious record of the lost.</p>
<p>The passionate embrace in which she clasped and held to her
heart the faith that her husband was still living, when few
doubted that he was dead, is most pathetically illustrated in the
letters she has left behind. The commander of every search
expedition which left our shores between 1848 and 1853, carried
one or other of these letters with him, sometimes containing an
enclosure from her niece, Miss Cracroft, always bearing messages
of love and hope from her step-daughter. Time after time they
were returned to her, even as the north wind might have blown
back the forlorn cry of the bereaved; but they were preserved
with sacred care. The same original was often re-copied and sent
out in substantially identical terms a second and a third time,
and the very reiteration of the same utterances of love, and
longing, and resignation is unspeakably sad. The first of these
letters, dated May 8 and 9, 1848, lies now before me, the wrapper
which originally enclosed it bearing the superscription, to
'Captain Sir John Franklin, R.N.: H.M.S. Erebus. To the care of
Sir James Ross.' This went with the first search expedition that
was sent out, and, written at a time when, of course, there was
still good ground for hope that Franklin might be still living,
its dominant note is one of pain at the thought of the suffering
which he might then, it was thought, be actually enduring, but
from which, as we know, he had been released eleven months
before. 'May it', writes the unconscious widow&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>may it be the will of God, if you are not restored to
us earlier, that you should open this letter, and that it may
give you comfort in all your trials. I feel sure that you must
all have suffered much, and perhaps, when you are met with, it
may be in a state of great exhaustion, and your numbers even may
be diminished, and many a bitter trial you may have had to bear.
May you have found your refuge and strength in Him whose mercies
you have so often experienced when every human aid was gone. If
the prayers of all who love you have availed with that merciful
God whose ear is ever open to the cry of all who trust to Him,
you will yet be spared to us. But we know that His ways are not
always such as we can adore without the subjection of many human
feelings to the exercise of the humblest and deepest faith. I try
to prepare myself for every trial which may be in store for me;
but, dearest, if you ever open this, it will be, I trust, because
I have been spared the greatest of all. Next to you I think of
dear Captain Crozier. I trust you have never been forced to
separate, and that you have been a mutual comfort to each other.
. . . We have not had any serious uneasiness about you till
lately. I felt sure you <i>meant</i> to have returned last
autumn, though your letter to me from Disco contemplated the
possibility&mdash;at least the words were capable of this
interpretation&mdash;of staying out a third winter, and everybody
thinks you would not return till forced by the want of
provisions. Sir James Ross thinks you have been sent by your
instructions to a part where you could hardly fail of being
inextricably entangled in the ice, somewhere about 73&deg; N. and
105&deg; W. Indeed, I believe he thinks you can never unassisted
get out of it.</blockquote>
<p>Here, it should be noted, are traces of that singular
misconception of Franklin's intended route which for so long led
the search parties astray, and through which so much invaluable
time was lost. Longitude 105&deg; W. is some seven or eight
degrees west of the point at which Franklin turned to the
southward, and is thus far nearer to Melville Island and that
part of the Arctic Ocean which Franklin&mdash;it must, or should,
have been well known to Ross and all other commanders of
searching parties&mdash;had been expressly counselled to
avoid.</p>
<p>Lady Franklin goes on to speak of her stepdaughter Eleanor's
approaching marriage to Mr. Gell; of Sir John Richardson, then
about to marry a third wife; of the preparations for Sir James
Ross's departure on the search expedition, and many matters
relating to friends and family which she thought would interest
her long absent husband. She concludes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>God bless you, my own dearest love. How ardently we
pray for you you will not doubt. It was settled between us and
the Bishop of Tasmania, who has lately left us, that on July 16
next prayers should be put up in Van Diemen's Land in every
church and chapel for you and all the expedition. It would have
been a less trial to me to come after you, as I was at one time
tempted to do, but I thought it my duty and my interest to
remain; for might I not have missed you, and would it have been
right to leave Eleanor? Vet, if I had thought you to be ill,
nothing should have stopped me. God bless you again. You will be
welcomed back with joy and honour by your friends and family and
country, most of all by your affectionate and devoted
wife.</blockquote>
<p>In May 1850 the substance of the letter went out a second time
to the Arctic seas by the hand of the veteran Sir John Ross, who
had, as he put it, 'given his word', and had 'publicly stated
that he would come to look for Franklin' if he was absent longer
than three years. By this time even Lady Franklin could no longer
believe that the explorers were still on board their ships.</p>
<blockquote>We are all prepared to hear that you have been forced
to abandon them, or that one of them is lost. If you are only
restored to us in any way, enfeebled as you may be, I shall bless
God for the mercy. If you live to read this and receive my
fondest blessing, I will thank Him still. I desire nothing but to
cherish the remainder of your days, however injured and broken
your health may be, but in all cases I will strive to bow to the
Almighty will and trust in His mercy for reunion in a better
world.</blockquote>
<p>The letter came back to the writer in the following year; but
ere it reached her the expiring flame of hope had been rekindled
in her bosom by the discoveries at Beechey Island, and she
despatched it again in 1851 under cover with the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The enclosed letter was brought back to me this
autumn by Sir John Ross on his return from Lancaster Sound. To
our extreme disappointment all the ships sent out in search of
you by the Government returned also. These included four under
Captain Austen, and two, called the Lady Franklin and the Sophia,
under Captain Penny, the whaling captain. Captain Austen during
last spring sent off travelling parties to Melville Island (where
<i>I</i> felt sure you would not be found, at least on the south
side) and also south-west of Cape Walker, where they judged no
ship could ever have passed. Captain Penny took another direction
and went up Wellington [Channel] with sledges, and convinced
himself you had gone that way in open water. They all had
previously found your winter quarters in 1845-6 at Beechey
Island. Penny had not materials to pursue his search another
year, so returned home this autumn as well as the rest, and now
another expedition is to start in the spring to pursue the course
through Wellington Channel. The little 'Prince Albert' private
expedition is attempting to reach James Ross Strait and Simpson
Strait to search for you in that direction.</blockquote>
<p>This was the expedition under Mr. Kennedy, which resulted in
the discovery of Bellot Strait.</p>
<blockquote>On the other, the Behring Strait, side, Captain
Collinson and Captain McClure have passed through Behring Strait
eastward towards Melville Island, but I fear in too low a
latitude to fall in with you and too near the coast of America to
be able to get along.<br>
<br>
Lastly, the bearer of this letter, Lieutenant Pim, R.N., has gone
out alone, supported by the Russian authorities, to seek for you
on the north and east coasts of Siberia and the islands to the
north, where, if God in His great mercy should bless his
endeavours, you may open this letter full of consolation and joy
to your broken-down and suffering heart. I hope you have never
for a moment thought that your country had forgotten you or left
you to your fate. You have felt sure that <i>I</i> could never
rest till we had some tidings of you. It is my mission upon
earth, my heart's sole thought, the one only object and
occupation of all my faculties and energies. Dearest husband, I
live, only for you.<br>
<br>
Eleanor and her husband are going on well in the same position in
London. . . .<br>
<br>
Sophy lives almost constantly with me and is to me as a daughter;
without her aid I should never have been able to get through the
work which God has assigned me, that of striving for your
rescue.</blockquote>
<p>Again in 1852, and yet again in 1853, this pathetic letter
from the living to the dead went forth upon its fruitless quest,
to return again and yet again to its writer. In 1854 Dr. Rae came
back with the relics obtained from the Eskimo, and then at last
Lady Franklin ceased to write. That brave and stubborn faith, the
nobler through its very unreason, with which for eight long years
she had clung to the belief in her husband's survival, had broken
down at last. Thenceforward she seems to have spoken of herself
as the 'widow', and no longer as the 'wife' of the illustrious
explorer; but the energies which had been so untiringly exerted
heretofore in the attempt to rescue were not relaxed, but simply
diverted into another channel, and she strove, as has been seen,
with a no less heroic resolution to obtain proof of the time and
manner of her husband's death. The story of her faithful and
unresting labours has an eloquence of its own, to which these
letters can add but little; and if, therefore, though almost too
sacred for the public eye, they are for the first time printed
here, it is much more on account of their profoundly touching
interest than with any idea that their publication is necessary
to put the tongue of malignant gossip to shame and silence.</p>
<p>In this connection, and as evidence of the feeling with which
Lady Franklin was regarded by that kinswoman of her husband's,
who was her constant companion and confidante, and had better
opportunities than any other human being of correctly estimating
the depth of her conjugal affection, the following letter from
Miss Cracroft should here be added. It was written for
consignment to the search party sent out in 1850 by Mr.
Grinnell.</p>
<blockquote>My dearest Uncle,&mdash;If this reaches you it will
be given by our American friends, for friends we must call any
who aid in restoring you to us in safety. It is believed to be
without a precedent that a nation should send forth an expedition
to rescue from danger and from death the people of another, and
that this noble instance of liberality, this glorious example is
afforded, is due to my dearest aunt. You will find that she is
spoken of with great enthusiasm by the Americans, and well may it
be so, for she has moved them to do great things. Last year she
wrote a letter to the President, and received a reply calculated
to excite not only admiration but the strongest hopes that the
Government would immediately send out an expedition to seek for
you. This letter and the reply was republished from the American
papers into our own and it (my aunt's) was spoken of in the House
of Commons by Sir Robert Inglis as the most admirable letter ever
addressed by man or woman to man or woman. It has everywhere
excited the deepest sympathy and admiration. Unhappily, last year
the American Government were unable to fulfil their benevolent
intentions, Congress was not then sitting and it was besides (in
April) too late to begin preparations, no vessels fitted for the
service being obtainable.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile my aunt kept up frequent communications with the United
States, and particularly with a Mr. Silas Burrows, who formed our
acquaintance in England last summer. Her letters to himself were
seen by Mr. Henry Grinnell, of New York, one of the merchant
princes of that city, and so strongly influenced his mind that he
proposed heading a subscription for fitting out a private
expedition with 5,000 dollars. Soon after he raised it to 10,000
dollars, and, upon seeing my aunt's next following letter, within
a fortnight after the first I have alluded to, he made his
contribution 15,000 dollars. Upon hearing of his first donation
my aunt wrote to thank him for it, and when he read this letter
he immediately augmented her contribution to the splendid gift of
30,000 dollars, selected his vessel and his officers who belong
to the United States navy, and, with probably some assistance,
will send them off early in May in search of you.<br>
<br>
You must not suppose that my aunt has attained this wonderful
result by using entreaties or by beseeching help. It has been
accomplished by the force of dignity, simplicity, and
earnestness, united to a most extraordinary extent in
herself.<br>
<br>
And to these qualities may in very great degree be attributed the
universal sympathy now experienced in England, for there is not a
woman in the kingdom so universally honoured and esteemed as your
wife. I cannot express to you how entirely I honour and love her,
and to be permitted to endeavour to comfort her and share her
sorrow is a privilege which I value above every other. Her
devotedness, her perseverance, and entire acquaintance with every
part of the question of search for you, combined with her
extraordinary mental endowments, have given her an influence
which is really wonderful, and of which people in general see
only the results. It is only for one who, like myself, has
witnessed her efforts, to recognise and appreciate them, though
there are some who do so nearly to the utmost, and these are your
nearest and dearest friends. Full and complete indeed will be her
reward if you are restored to her in safety, compensation even
for all she has suffered.</blockquote>
<p>Not much more remains to be written of this brave and devoted
life, despite the length of years from this date to which it was
yet to run. For it was one long dedication to Franklin's memory,
and its history would resolve itself, so far as the purposes of
this narrative are concerned, into a record of daily solicitude
and effort for the preservation of that memory to the world.
Assisted in this task by Miss Cracroft, the attached and faithful
companion of her closing years, whose love and admiration for her
found such eloquent expression in the letter given above, Lady
Franklin spent the remainder of her life in the diligent
collection of those materials for a memoir of her husband which
have been employed for the purposes of this volume. In this mass
of epistolary and other matter, numbering more than two thousand
documents of various descriptions, is included all the
correspondence, not only of, but with, her husband of which Lady
Franklin could obtain originals or copies. Every scrap of written
paper which had felt the touch of his hand, and which bore, even
hi the remotest degree, on the incidents or interests of his
life, was carefully treasured up, often, it is evident, as a
relic rather than a document. His various commissions in the
navy, the official instruments attesting the successive honours
conferred upon him, the roughest ..drafts of his memoranda as
commander of ships or leader of expeditions, the maps and plans
employed by him on his voyages and journeyings, the note-books,
diaries, letter-books, and what not, to which he, the most
regular and laborious of chroniclers, committed a record of the
discharged duties or the encountered dangers of the
day&mdash;everything, down even to his 'reader's ticket' at the
British Museum, and, as we have seen, the card of invitation to
the ball on board that ship in which he was to die, has been
religiously preserved. The papers relating to his midshipman days
on board the Polyphemus and the Bellerophon are, of course, the
fewest in number, and equally of course belong in most instances
to the class of relics, rather than of <i>m&eacute;moires pour
servir</i>, but their human interest is often none the less for
that, and the tender light which is thrown on the nature of her
who preserved them by (for instance) the worn and faded, but
carefully arranged and labelled, packet of papers which now lies
before me inscribed with the words, 'Sir John Franklin's French
Exercises', gives them a value of their own.</p>
<p>Nor was the diligent collector of these records less
solicitous for the perpetuation of her husband's memory in other
ways. Everything which appeared in any public form about him was
regularly read and became the subject of her comment or
correction. She was especially interested in the biographical
accounts of her husband which appeared from time to time in
various publications, one of which was contributed by his old
friend Sir John Richardson to the eighth edition of the
'Encyclopaedia Britannica', and she interested herself earnestly
in the proposal of Franklin's Lincolnshire fellow-citizens to
erect a statue in his honour.</p>
<blockquote>'I read with deep emotion of the disinterested honour
proposed to be paid by the City of Lincoln', she writes,
addressing the town clerk of that municipality, 'to the memory of
my dear husband, and I hope I may be permitted, without intruding
myself too much on your attention, to express the gratitude I
feel at the generous expression of your esteem for your departed
countryman. Had that humble-minded but heroic man ever
contemplated any higher reward in his hard career of service than
the consciousness of having fulfilled his duty to the utmost, he
would have desired no higher honour than the tribute you dedicate
to him and to those beloved companions of his toil and danger
whose honour and interests he ever identified with his own.<br>
<br>
I strive to think that, though these martyrs in their country's
service knew not of the fraternal hands that were stretched out
to save them, they yet must have felt assured, living and dying,
that their memories would be embalmed in the hearts of their
countrymen, and that whether the discovery which they sealed in
death were ever revealed to the world or not, yet that their name
would be inscribed among those which will never be forgotten.<br>
<br>
Again I thank you for thus realising, and more than realising,
the dreams which perhaps helped to fill their dying hours. It
will be to the lasting honour of the county of my beloved
husband's birth that it originated the generous movement which I
trust will spread as widely as you kindly contemplate. May I beg
the favour of you to convey to those gentlemen who, with you,
have originated or are co-operating in it, my grateful
sentiments?</blockquote>
<p>Yet how her sorrow for her husband was tempered by pride in
his achievements, and in what a spirit, worthy of ancient times,
she could still bring herself to look upon that national work
which had cost her all that was dearest to her in the world, is
well seen from the letter she wrote to Sir Roderick Murchison,
when projects of Polar exploration were again afoot in 1865.</p>
<blockquote>Although I have little doubt you know from some of
our friends that they have written to me on the subject of the
expedition, yet I cannot leave it to them alone to tell you how
very deeply I sympathise with the proposed effort, and how
earnestly I wish it may be realised. For the credit and honour of
England the exploration of the North Pole should not be left to
any other country. . . .<br>
<br>
I am sending you these lines because I do not wish you to think
it possible that my interest can flag in anything connected with
Arctic enterprise; and though at first sad memories of the past
made me feel some sickness of heart at the revival of the
question, I have struggled against that weakness and overcome it.
. . . It would indeed be unreasonable and much to be deplored if
the fate of my dear husband and his companions were to be made an
official objection to Arctic exploration. They met with the
unhappy end which has often befallen the pioneers of tentative
and dangerous enterprises, but they rest alone in their awful
calamity. Every succeeding expedition sailed with better ships,
better equipments, better charts, better supports, and with
ever-increasing knowledge; and thus it has happened that no naval
service on the face of the globe exhibits on the average so few
casualties as that in the Polar Seas. You have justly said that
'in the proposed expedition no such calamity can be dreaded, for
it has no analogy to the case of Franklin.'</blockquote>
<p>The project of erecting a memorial to the great explorer in
his native county was not unfittingly modified by the
substitution of his actual birthplace for the City of Lincoln as
the site of the proposed statue; and in the market square of
Spilsby it was duly erected, and now stands. A local tribute of
honour, however, would have been a wholly inadequate recognition
of a fame which was world-wide, and it would have been a shame to
England if one who had added lustre to her name had been left
without any token of her gratitude visible among the monuments of
her capital.</p>
<p>This national duty was at last fulfilled. A sum of
2,000<i>l</i>. was voted by Parliament for the erection of that
monument which now stands in Waterloo Place to the memory of 'the
great navigator and his brave companions who sacrificed their
lives in completing the discovery of the North-West Passage, A.D.
1847-1848.'</p>
<p>Lady Franklin felt, however, that the fame and services of her
husband were entitled to record in that national shrine in which
it has always been the ambition of the noblest Englishmen to
obtain a resting-place for their ashes, or a perpetuation of
their names. One of the last, if not the very last, of her
labours on behalf of her husband's memory was the erection of a
marble monument of Sir John Franklin in Westminster Abbey, which
was unveiled in July 1875, only a fortnight before she herself
passed away at the age of eighty-three. She had wished to write
the epitaph itself, but she died before she had time to perform
that final work, and it was her husband's nephew by marriage, the
late Poet Laureate, who afterwards, as all the world knows, added
to it that inscription which has given a second immortality to
the hero whom it celebrates:</p>
<p class="poem">Not here! the white North hath thy bones, and
thou,<br>
            Heroic sailor soul,<br>
Art passing on thy happier voyage now<br>
            Towards no earthly pole.</p>
<p>Hardly less beautiful were the words appended to it by Dean
Stanley in record of the event so pathetically close in sequence
to it&mdash;Lady Franklin's death. The monument to Franklin was,
it runs, 'erected by his widow, who, after long waiting and
sending many in search of him, herself departed to seek and to
find him in the realms of light.'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV</h3>
<p align="center">CHARACTER AND CAREER<br>
<br>
1786-1847</p>
<p><small>PERSONAL</small> reminiscences of Franklin have become
rare and difficult to obtain. Born fourteen years before the
close of the last century, he has naturally left no surviving
contemporaries in the strict sense of the word, and nearly all
even of those who ever came into contact with him after they
themselves had reached years of maturity have now sunk into the
grave. The companions of his adventures and sufferings, some of
whom were considerably younger than himself and outlived him many
years, have all long since passed away. Sir John Richardson, the
one man, perhaps, who knew him best and was the most closely
attached to him by ties both of friendship and affinity, is no
more. Sir George Back has been dead nearly twenty years and Sir
James Clark Ross more than thirty. Sir Edward Parry, the object
of Franklin's lifelong regard and generous admiration, did not
even live to witness the discovery of the last record of his
friend.</p>
<p>Of his relatives, the children and grandchildren of his
brothers and sisters, many still survive, but even to the elder
of the two generations of boys and girls their sailor uncle was
but a mysterious and heroic figure, seldom, and then only for
very brief periods, revealed to them in the flesh. Hence their
recollections of him, though often interesting and touching, are
necessarily among the memories of the very young. They remember
him, that is to say, from a day when the oldest among them was
not much over ten or twelve years of age and he himself not much
under fifty. Those relatives of blood or affinity who had reached
adult years before he left England for the last time, and who
might have preserved the impressions left by him upon mature
minds, had been, with a single exception, separated from him by
many thousand miles of sea during the time when such impressions
might have been formed. The one exception is that of the Rev.
Philip Gell, who, then a young man fresh from the University,
made Franklin's acquaintance within the last ten years of the
explorer's life, and lived for four or five of those years in
close and sympathetic intercourse with his future father-in-law.
Mr. Gell has, at the request of the writer, been good enough to
supply the following vivid and interesting reminiscences of
Franklin during his Australasian career.</p>
<p>'It is fifty years since Franklin bade me his last farewell,
and the few letters I had from him afterwards were on family
matters. But I wish I could send you some photographs as they are
still imprinted on my memory of his manner and actions. I first
felt his attraction on the day I found myself (a boy) kneeling by
his side in Rugby Chapel to take the Communion at Arnold's hands.
And only seven years later, in a sequestered anchorage of
Tasmania, that sorrowful face, so kind and true, looked on me for
the last time as he was leaving for England.</p>
<p>'I remember sharing a small tent with him on one of his
expeditions, and being much impressed, as I was falling asleep in
the deep darkness of the prim&aelig;val forest, by hearing his I
devotions before he lay down on his bed of ferns. Forgetful,
apparently (he was deaf), of any one's presence, he spoke aloud
and softly at the Throne of Grace with affecting intercessions
for those dear to him; and his prayers were those of a child.</p>
<p>'His mode of handling infants was delightful. He was a very
strong man, and the little ones seemed to revel in his arms; and
he, on his part, seemed to "follow their innocency".</p>
<p>'When, in 1840-41, the Antarctic expedition put into winter
quarters, under his congenial care, his grave delight at their
presence, and his interest in their ways and doings, made them
twice the men they were before, and nerved them for their grand
discoveries. He would sit up all night with the young officers at
their magnetic observatory, taking his turn at the instruments,
and in the three-minute intervals of observation trying to read
Shakespeare, mingled with jokes and stories of the sea.</p>
<p>'A miniature Vice-regal Court was in those times a curious
appendage of a Crown colony. On high days and holidays his way
was worth observing. Humour would sparkle in his eye as certain
of his grandees rendered their ungainly homage. Yet he "honoured
all men"; and all honoured him. And when the outside multitude
drew him home in his carriage, he took it like a sailor in a
breeze of wind, and they liked him all the more. No one ever
heard that they did so to other Governors. His presence seemed to
satisfy a want.</p>
<p>'When attending him on board a newly arrived convict ship from
England, I heard him speak to the prisoners with such candour,
firmness, and kindness, that it really seemed as if he felt more
than they&mdash;which perhaps he did. Certainly they liked him
for it, and began, some of them, to love him.</p>
<p>'Chicanery he could not away with; it made him ill, and so
paralysed him that when he had to deal with it he was scarcely
himself.</p>
<p>'More than once his health was shaken under the burden of
three thousand convicts, annually thrown upon his hands from
England. There were elements of violence and corruption to be
controlled, fierce, dangerous, and foul. And truly it was
sickening work.</p>
<p>'Almost as paralysing, to a man of his temper, were the
vagaries of sundry weak and wilful officials, who had made their
way into the service of the Crown.</p>
<p>'And he found another source of hopeless sorrow in the fate of
the perishing Aborigines. One evening his reception rooms at
Government House were filled by local magnates, and showy
uniforms, and bright daughters of the colony, with music and
singing, when a man in livery came up to his Excellency, bearing
a sheet of gum-tree bark, half as large as himself. It had been
brought that night from the depths of the forest, a hundred miles
away; the forest which it was hoped and believed had been long
since cleared of blacks. The bark bore the charcoal picture of a
kangaroo, freshly-made by a native. An anxious future of
bloodshed and reprisals rose before the company. The word on
every lip was, "Catch them". But the Governor remained sorrowful
and silent; as one who dealt with an insoluble problem.</p>
<p>'There was a wild girl taken in the woods, where her father
and mother had perished; and when she was brought before Sir John
he pointed to her, saying, "What name?" She wore nothing but a
necklace of small bright shells, strung on a sinew. Thinking that
he asked after that, she said, "Methinna"&mdash;native for
necklace. So he gave her the name, and entrusted her to the care
of his own daughter. Soon a scarlet tunic was provided; and the
little one proved a good girl, though her tempestuous passions
sometimes shook the order of the schoolroom at Government
House.</p>
<p>'His comfort in the darkest days was his early walk with his
daughter in the beautiful Government garden. She much resembled
him in the nobler points of his character; his devotion,
fortitude, and self-sacrifice; his endurance, his generosity, and
care for his followers and dependents; and she shared his
heavenward aspirations. As they walked together, Methinna would
be darting about, or climbing the trees with hand and toe, native
fashion, peering down with wild bright eyes out of the lofty
foliage upon the two best friends she had in the world.</p>
<p>'Like his old friend, Sir Edward Parry, he was an impressive
reader. When his last ship was in commission, the Bishop
(Stanley) of Norwich would come on board on a Sunday to "hear"
the captain. And what the Bishop liked, the officers and men
liked too. Here is a last letter home from one of his men:</p>
<p align="right" class="quote"><small>Erebus, May 25,
1845.</small>   <br>
<br></p>
<blockquote>We had church this morning, and Sir John Franklin
read to us a very beautiful sermon. Sir John took his text from
the xviith chapter, 1 Kings, 16th verse, 'And the barrel of meal
wasted not, neither did I the cruse of oil fail, according to the
word of the Lord.' Sir John called the ship's company's attention
to that part of the sermon: and the whole of the ship's company
were very much pleased with Sir John's appropriate text, and
united in this point of view with Sir John, to accomplish our
object which we have in view. And that with the help of the
Almighty, I verily believe [we shall]. I have just received
orders to pass the word for all that wish to attend divine
service to go aft into Sir John's cabin at 8 o'clock this
evening. And, my dearest Anne, I shall always go as long as I am
able. I could remain for hours to hear him.'</blockquote>
<p>One or two anecdotes derived from the recollections of the
Rev. Canon Wright, the son of Sir John Franklin's youngest
sister, Henrietta, have already appeared in the text. Their
narrator has now kindly enabled me to supplement them with the
contribution following:&mdash;</p>
<p>'In reply to your letter asking for any personal reminiscences
I might have of Sir John Franklin I am sorry to say that these
are necessarily very few. I have a dim recollection of his coming
to my father's house at Wrangle just before he went out to Van
Diemen's Land in 1836, and, though I was then the merest child, I
can see him now in imagination standing before the fire in the
dining-room, rather deaf but engaged in earnest conversation with
my father and mother about other members of the family, in whom
he manifested the greatest interest. The next and only other time
I saw him was at Boston, at the house of Mr. Millington (my
father's brother-in-law), who kindly invited Sir John's relatives
in Lincolnshire to meet him there, a few days before he left
England, in May 1845. Just then I was fired with the English
boy's idea of becoming a sailor, and so, in my simplicity, I
begged my mother to ask him whether he could take me with him on
the approaching expedition. I expressed my readiness to go even
as a <i>powder-monkey</i>, though exactly what the duties of a
powder-monkey were I had no very definite knowledge, except that
they were of an inferior description. I remember very distinctly
his reply; placing his hand on my shoulder he said, "No, my boy,
I cannot take you. We must have in this service no cats that
can't catch mice. Do your duty and what your mother tells you,
and when I come back I will see what can be done for you." The
dear old sea captain has never returned; but on my part, God
helping me, I have tried to follow out his last instructions, and
to my doing so I owe whatever of success in life I may have
attained.</p>
<p>'I have, not unfrequently, heard my mother speak of Sir John
Franklin in earlier days. They were nearly of the same age, and
as children often together. When he was a small boy he used to
make it his practice to attend all the weddings and funerals that
occurred in Spilsby Church, and hence it may be, as well as from
the religious tone of his character, that it was thought that he
would be favourably disposed to taking Holy Orders, and the
living of Holton Beckering, near Wragby, was obtained for him
under that expectation. On one occasion he and his playmates were
competing with one another as to the position of future
distinction which each should aim at. This one would be content
with the occupation of a country squire, with carriages and
horses, etc., that one with some great military achievement
against the French; but John, as the discussion went on,
perceiving that the whole field of earthly ambition was rapidly
being swept from his grasp, impatiently exclaimed, "And
<i>I'll</i> get a ladder and <i>climb to Heaven!</i>" Verily it
would seem that even at that early age he had caught the spirit
of Glaucus, when he tells Diomede in the 6th Book of the Iliad
that he had learnt</p>

<p>'The boys of the Franklin family were generally considered to
be the "defenders of the right" at Spilsby, and some amusing
stories have been told of their prowess in this respect.</p>
<p>'Mrs. Drummond Rawnsley, a daughter of his brother, Sir
Willingham Franklin, Judge of the Supreme Court of Judicature at
Madras, told me shortly before she died that after her
confirmation she met with Sir John Franklin in London, who asked
her whether she had ever attended the Holy Communion, and on her
replying in the negative, he said, with the air of one who
considered that a most important standing order had been broken,
"Why, my dear, this is all wrong; you must be prepared to go with
me on Sunday morning next. I shall come for you." And he came,
and with him she made her first Communion.</p>
<p>'I have asked my cousin, Lady Tennyson (who was also my
godmother, and therefore older than myself), whether she has any
interesting recollections, but like my own they are not many. She
replies: "I am sorry I can contribute nothing which seems to me
worthy of Mr. Traill's Biography. My uncle was a great deal with
my father during my mother's lifetime, but, of course, I remember
nothing of this, since I lost my mother when I was only three
years old. My first recollection of him is that, when carried in
my nurse's arms to her funeral, I touched his shoulder and asked,
'What are they doing?' My last is when, just before his latest
Arctic expedition, I saw him at Somerset House, and, if my memory
fail not, he said, 'Remember, Emily, if I do not return when I am
expected, I have made for the open sea at the Pole."</p>
<p>'Personally I have always had the warmest admiration of Sir
John Franklin's character, based not only on what I have heard
from those who knew him well, but also on a large correspondence
of his which has come into my possession. He seems to have been
always so brave and generous, so able, unselfish, and
affectionate, so unshrinkingly true in his duty to God and
man.'</p>
<p>Mrs. G. B. A. Lefroy, a surviving sister of Miss Sophia
Cracroft, so often referred to in the foregoing pages, writes as
follows:</p>
<p>'With respect to the suggestion that I maybe able to supply
some personal reminiscences of my uncle, Sir John Franklin, I
regret very much that I can add but little worth publishing. He
was so seldom on shore, and for such short intervals, and
although my mother, Mrs. Thomas Cracroft (who was left a widow at
an early age), and her children were always objects of his
interest and most affectionate care, I cannot remember his ever
staying with us except for a few weeks at Castle Hedingham,
Essex, soon after his return from Tasmania and shortly before he
obtained the command of the Erebus and Terror. Although he was
very fond of the companionship of children and young people, I
recollect that his usually grave and serious manner rather awed
us, although he liked a joke and had a most loving and
affectionate nature. He was quick in reproving faults of habit
and manner, and would not hesitate to try to correct them by good
advice, which I suppose is not always palatable to children. Some
of my sisters had the very objectionable habit of biting their
nails, which he could not endure, and when taking a walk with him
round the garden and into the country, in which he delighted,
they avoided, if possible, taking his hand, that they might
escape the detection of a bitten nail which would bring down a
reproof.</p>
<p>'He was a devourer of books of every kind, and nothing pleased
him more than to be let alone. When thus employed and oblivious
of all around him, he would pass many a happy hour
undisturbed.</p>
<p>'He disliked notoriety and never sought it. He was never so
happy as when afloat. Soon after his return from one of his early
Arctic voyages, my mother told me he joined her at Brighton. The
Court v/as then resident there at the Pavilion, and the place
crowded. My uncle attracted a good deal of observation when out
of doors, and this he avoided as much as possible. On one
occasion, however, from the midst of a crowd who recognised him,
a voice called out, "That's the man who ate his shoes", much to
his amusement.</p>
<p>'To illustrate his determination of character, a few weeks
before he left England on his last voyage he took a house in
Brook Street, Grosvenor Square, for the purpose of taking leave
of his friends and of making acquaintance with the officers
selected to accompany him. He was there attacked by a severe
influenza cold, the first illness, I believe, he ever had,
although he never took to his bed but went about as usual, and
was much occupied in preparations for final departure. His
medical attendant recommended him to leave off his lifelong habit
of taking snuff. He undertook to do this, and, although I suppose
he could scarcely have realised the great strain such a sudden
abandonment of the habit would entail, he never wavered in his
determination or shrank from the self-denial. He used to
endeavour to supply the loss of the stimulant with strong
smelling salts and hartshorn, and so he persevered and never
resumed the old-fashioned habit of those days. Would an habitual
smoker of these days show as much self-denial and
determination?</p>
<p>'I heard from my sister that a few days before he sailed on
his last voyage his wife, the late Lady Franklin, was putting a
finishing touch to a union-jack he was to take with him, and, as
he lay on the sofa, she threw it over him, which distressed him,
and he exclaimed, "Oh Jane! what have you done?" alluding, of
course, to the popular superstition which has arisen from the use
of the union-jack as a shroud for the bodies of those who are
buried at sea.' *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mrs. Lefroy adds this curious little anecdote
in illustration of the manners of the forties: 'A large party of
relations and friends went down to Greenhithe, to see the last of
the Erebus and Terror, and to share in the final farewells and
the sanguine hopes for a speedy return. On their way home the
party passed through Greenwich Park during the notorious
Greenwich Fair, and one of the party, a great friend and admirer
of my uncle, the late Bishop of Norwich (Stanley), was knocked
down and had his pockets emptied, and all were glad to
escape.']</p>
<p>Among those still spared to us who knew Franklin well in the
later years of his life was, it may be remembered, the
distinguished diplomatist Sir Henry Elliot. In an article
contributed by him to a monthly review a few years ago, on the
subject of Admiral Markham's then recent monograph on the great
explorer, Sir Henry speaks of himself as 'having, as a very young
man, lived for three years as one of the family in the home of
Sir John Franklin, for whom', he adds, he had 'the affection of a
son for his father.' How true a description of the feeling with
which his sometime private secretary regarded Franklin, the
correspondence which passed between them after the former's
quitting Tasmania to enter the diplomatic service amply proves,
and Franklin's reciprocation of this filial sentiment no less
fully deserves to be described as paternal. No breath of
disagreement ever seems to have ruffled the tranquillity of
relations which only good nature, good sense, and tact on both
sides could have maintained for three years in unbroken
smoothness. Not many more men are angels to their private
secretaries than are heroes to their valets; and that the youth
of twenty, necessarily inexperienced in his duties, should have
lived to look back on his intercourse with the busied and
worried, not to say 'badgered', governor of a not easily
governable colony with the feelings which animate Sir Henry
Elliot's retrospect, speaks highly for the qualities both of the
secretary and of the chief. 'Franklin's great characteristic', he
writes, 'was his thoughtfulness for others and his complete
absence of thought for himself; deeply religious, his duty to God
and man was at all times his sole and only guide; and when he had
once decided what that duty was, no earthly consideration could
turn him a hair's breadth from it. Of a singularly simple and
affectionate nature, identifying himself with the interests and
welfare of those over whom he was placed, he won their love in an
extraordinary degree, and although of highly sensitive feelings,
he was never known to be provoked to use a harsh or hasty word;
and with such a combination of kindness and resolution Captain
Fitzjames might well describe him as "of all men the most fitted"
to command an expedition such as that in which they both lost
their lives.'</p>
<p>The universal sentiments of respect and affection with which
he inspired the people of that colony, his administration of
which had so untoward a close, have been already noted in the
account of his departure; and the enthusiasm with which the
colonists bade farewell to him was no momentary emotion. It may
be doubted whether any colonial governor has ever left behind him
more enduring memories of regard. The generous contribution which
was so readily made by the people of Tasmania to the search
expeditions was only one of many and various testimonies to their
grateful recollection of their former ruler. Nearly ten years
after his departure the historian of the colony, whose work has
been so frequently quoted in the foregoing pages, paid a tribute
to his character and services which is all the more valuable from
the candour with which the writer dwells upon Franklin's
inability, as he considers it, to cope with the difficulties of
an office 'for which his former pursuits had not prepared him.'
'His manner (says Mr. West) was often embarrassed and hesitating,
and presented a contrast to the quiet vigour of his more able but
not more amiable predecessor.' But 'the administration of the
former was eminently disinterested. He had no private
speculations or secret agents, and his measures were free from
both the taint and the reproach of corruption. His expenditure
greatly exceeded his official income, and while the plainness of
his establishment and entertainments was the topic of thoughtless
censure, the charities of his family were scattered with a
liberal hand.' The writer might have added that Franklin declined
an increase of salary voted him by the colonial Legislature.</p>
<p>Another witness, of the same profession as this writer, the
Rev. T. L. Ewing, writing from Newtown Parsonage, assures Lady
Franklin that her 'husband's name is never mentioned here without
an endearing epithet. So true is it that people only value their
blessings rightly when they have lost them.' And how his memory
lived in the hearts of the humblest and most despised class of
the community, the following most interesting letter from
Commander Pasco to Lady Franklin in 1858 will show:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The circumstance which has induced me to write direct
to you instead of to Miss Cracroft as usual, is that of meeting
an old man yesterday as I was travelling through the bush about
ten miles from this place down the Murray.<br>
<br>
Overtaking a weary traveller on foot, with his bundle of bedding
on his back, and learning on enquiry that he had walked up from
the Darling, a distance of at least 200 miles, I could not help
offering to dismount and give him a lift for a few miles; which
he declined for himself but accepted for his swag, as he termed
his bedding. We jogged along talking of his long journey, which
he made light of.<br>
<br>
I soon ascertained that he had been a prisoner, and in reply to
my question, how long he had been free, he said, 'Oh, that dear
old gentleman Sir John gave me my free pardon for going to
Macquarie Harbour with him.' I did not at once discover to him
that I had any knowledge of that event, but let him relate to me
the details of the journey. I cannot tell you how my heart warmed
towards the old man as he enlarged on your and our beloved and
revered absent one. Especially was I struck with the vivid
impression left on the man's mind by the aptness of his chief to
encourage and support those of the party who might appear to
despond. 'Oh sir!' he said, 'you should have seen him cheering us
up when smothered in snow under the "Frenchman's cap." "Come,
come, my boys!" he would say, "this is nothing at all, you should
laugh at this!" And when we got on short tucker (to use old
Smith's own phrase for provisions) there was a doctor chap who
wanted to cut us short and keep a full allowance for the gentry
and Lady Franklin (for she was there too), but Sir John said,
"No, no; let us go short, if you like, and give it to the men who
do the work", for', said Smith, 'there was one gentleman with a
hammer who used to load us with big stones [doubtless some ardent
geologist of the party], but Sir John was always our friend.'<br>
<br>
I could fill a quire with his anecdotes, including some of
yourself being borne in a sort of sedan they rigged up for you;
but sometimes you let your maid have a spell. I let him run on
with his tale, and I cannot describe his astonishment on hearing
how near I was to the party when it quitted Macquarie Harbour.
Smith has been many years shepherding in the neighbourhood, and
is on his way to a new station.</blockquote>
<p>It is satisfactory to find that he made such good use of the
liberty obtained for him fourteen years before. He was, of
course, one of the men whose release had been maliciously
commented upon by the Tasmanian press, and in his account of the
'rigged-up sedan' we find the germ of the calumnious legend which
represented Franklin as dispensing the royal favour, as a sort of
Oriental satrap, to the bearers of his wife's 'palanquin.'</p>
<p>The honour in which his name was so long held in this distant
part of the globe is in some sort typical of his general fame. In
the enduring vitality of their affection for Franklin the people
of Tasmania were only supplying, as his countrymen at home had
supplied, an impressive illustration of the grand truth that it
is not in what men do but in what they are that their greatness
lies. Franklin's government of the colony had been marred by
contentions and had closed in storm; but the instinct of its
people told them that the man was greater than his work. And so,
in a certain sense, he had shown himself in every undertaking of
his life. Mr. A. H. Beesly has justly remarked in his interesting
monograph on the famous explorer, published some years ago, that
the whole history of his explorations is a record, if not exactly
of failure, yet always and everywhere of imperfect success. In
1819-22 he accomplished a maritime journey of great scientific
value under extraordinary difficulties, and fought his way home
by land through appalling privations; but he did not succeed, as
he had hoped, in completing the survey of the coast of Arctic
America eastward from the mouth of the Coppermine River. In
1825-27 he made another large addition to the sum of geographical
knowledge to the west of the Mackenzie; but he failed to effect
the desired junction with the voyagers from Behring Strait. In
1845 he set forth in quest of a north-west passage, and succeeded
only in discovering a route which he did not live to traverse.
Yet the fame which he won for himself could not have been
brighter of lustre or more assured of perpetuity if he had
explored the whole coastline of Arctic America to the eastward in
1821 and to the westward in 1826, and had sailed from the
Atlantic to the Pacific in 1845. His countrymen, and the entire
civilised world, have recognised that the great though imperfect
exploits of the traveller were outshone by the heroic qualities
of the man, and out of the wealth of their own admiration they
have made good his 'inheritance of unfulfilled renown.'</p>
<p>He was moreover endowed, and in a pre-eminent degree, with a
quality which does not always accompany greatness&mdash;the
quality of charm. To the abundant evidences of his many endearing
characteristics which have been cited in the course of this
narrative it would be superfluous to add. No leader ever lived
who commanded a more enthusiastic devotion from his followers.
From the comrades whom he sustained with his indomitable spirit
in the frozen wilds of Arctic America to the convicts who
responded so heartily to his cheery encouragement in the
Tasmanian bush, the attraction of his personality seems to have
been felt alike by all. The fervent piety of his deeply religious
nature was never obtruded by him, never became, as it has too
often become with men of a less genial and humane temperament, a
repellent influence upon those who were not in sympathy with his
devout spirit. There was no touch of self-righteousness or
spiritual vanity about him. In this respect he differed as widely
as possible from that peculiar type of officer, well-meaning of
motive, but injudicious of method, who used to be known in the
army as a 'preaching colonel.' Though far from being ashamed of
his religion or unwilling to testify in its behalf before the
world&mdash;an old messmate of his told his sister that he always
considered that Franklin 'first introduced religion into the
gunroom' of the Bedford&mdash;his piety was throughout his life
of the sober and practical order natural to an Englishman born
and brought up in the Church of England during that long period
of what certain excitable persons would call 'stagnation', which
divided the two great 'revivals' of the mid-eighteenth and
mid-nineteenth century from each other. It had no affinities with
either the ecstatic or the ascetic form of the religious emotion,
and it was certainly free from any tendency to give undue
prominence to faith over works. It was emphatically the piety of
a man of action and endeavour, of him to whom, though the evening
never fails to bring the hour of spiritual self-communing and
meditation, the day seems best spent in untiring struggle with
the hostile forces of Nature, best dedicated to that labour which
itself is prayer. In a word, it was the piety which supported
Havelock in his swift and splendid march over the burning plains
of India, and Gordon in his lonely vigil at Khartoum; the piety
which, through generations of our history, has carried so many
strenuous English workers by land and sea through a life of
perils to an heroic death.</p>
<p>And in Franklin's case, as in theirs, it was fused and
interpenetrated with that patriotism which to Englishmen is
itself a religion, and to too many among them the only one they
have. Cradled in the traditions of the most glorious era of our
naval history, it seemed as natural a thing to him that English
sailors should lead the van of maritime exploration as that
English ships of war should command the seas. He was devoted, as
we have seen, from his midshipman days to the duties, scientific
as well as practical, of his calling, and as for the sea itself,
the ardour of his passion for it never abated. That 'love at
first sight' was also a love for life; the spell which was thrown
over the schoolboy on the beach at Saltfleet remained unbroken to
the end. 'He was never so happy', says Mrs. Lefroy, 'as when
afloat.' It is almost amusing to note how soon at all periods of
his career the landsman's life began to pall upon him&mdash;how
little of it he really wanted, and how long a way that little
went. Next to 'active employment', the one perpetual need of his
nature, the sea and the seaman's life were the objects of his
strongest craving. Rather than remain idle he would govern a
colony willingly enough; but far rather than govern a colony
would he have taken command of a ship for some adventurous
voyage. All the sailor in his nature came out in the eager
enthusiasm with which he welcomed Ross and Crozier to Hobart
Town, the almost boyish delight with which he threw himself into
their work, the wistfulness with which he watched the fading of
their sails in those mists of the unknown Antarctic into which he
would so fain have followed them.</p>
<p>With these instincts, moreover, he united the whole
traditional character of the sailor&mdash;that character which is
dearer than all others to the national heart. Never has it been
represented in a more typical example. The bluff, straightforward
honesty, the hearty kindliness, the invincible buoyancy of
temperament, the quick impetuosity&mdash;they were all there in
Franklin; and we somehow seem to recognise their latent presence
under whatever uncongenial conditions of circumstance and
environment. One is certainly conscious of their suppression
during much of the history of his Tasmanian governorship. That
Franklin's intellectual gifts were by no means inconsiderable,
his official correspondence shows. His shrewd mother wit and
sound judgment, his spirit of healthy contempt for the mawkish,
restrained as that spirit was by genuine goodness of heart from
running into harshness, would have made him, under happier
conditions, the ideal ruler of a penal settlement; for convicts,
like children, know well enough how to distinguish the firm
kindness which wins their respect as well as their love from the
weak amiability which, while they practise on it, they despise.
And Franklin, with a freer hand, would have been an excellent and
successful administrator all round. As a benevolent despot of the
early Anglo-Indian type, he would have been admirably well
placed; as, indeed, he would have been in any other post
entailing a maximum of practical activity with a minimum of
consultation and debate. He was a governor born to govern, as has
been said, 'from the saddle' rather than from the council room;
and even his ablest and most carefully drafted memoranda on
transportation, trade, local government, and other colonial
matters, leave the impression that the writer would far rather be
illustrating his views in practice than explaining them on paper.
Among the variety of untoward causes which led to his later
administrative troubles, one may perhaps include a touch of
impatience with an uncongenial situation and its distasteful
duties.</p>
<p>Foremost, however, and most conspicuous among his qualities
was his extraordinary fortitude. Richardson, himself a man with
immense powers of endurance, was wont to the end of his days to
speak of it with wondering admiration as without parallel among
the hardy race of Arctic explorers to which they both belonged.
It was so much the more marvellous, he was in the habit of
saying, because Franklin owed least of all men to any peculiar
advantages of bodily constitution. The capacity to resist extreme
cold is very unequally distributed among natives of the milder
regions of the earth, and Franklin had not more, but less, than
the normal share. His circulation was slow and his vitality,
therefore, easily lowered. He suffered all his life, and even in
England, from cold hands and feet. Temperament had in his case to
be called in at an unusually early stage to supply the lack of
temperature, and long before his comrades had exhausted their
physical powers of resistance to the rigours of the Arctic
climate, Franklin had been drawing upon moral resources alone.
Yet this was the man, this 'chilly mortal', of the sluggish blood
and benumbed extremities, who, from the deadliest of all his
struggles with frost and famine, brought home so untamed a
courage and so unshaken a resolve that ere a year had passed he
was longing to renew the battle, nay, eagerly soliciting the
order to measure himself once more against these cruel foes.</p>
<p>But though he loved adventure for adventure's sake, though he
revelled, as strength and daring always revel, in the strife with
difficulty, it was another and a rarer impulse which sent him to
his death. His highest and truest claim to the rank of a national
hero is that he was filled with that spirit which is even more
national than the love of adventure, more English even than the
passion for the 'great waters'&mdash;the thirst for the discovery
of the unknown. 'They cannot help it, these Arctic fellows', said
Lord Brougham, when he was told that Franklin, on the verge of
sixty, had set out in quest of the North-west Passage; 'they
cannot help it; it is in the blood.' But it has been in the
blood, not of 'these Arctic Fellows' alone, but of their
countrymen for centuries past; in the blood of Drake and Hawkins,
of Cook and Flinders, of Speke and Livingstone and Stanley. In
the veins of Franklin it glowed with an unquenchable and lifelong
ardour. Neither advancing age nor the distractions of a new
career had any power over it. That blank space on the map of
Arctic America haunted him incessantly for twenty years; that
unbridged gap of 300 miles between the overlapping routes of
Dease and Parry would not let him rest. And thus it was that, in
the evening of his life, at a time when most men's thoughts would
be turning to repose, he set forth once more, another
Ulysses,</p>
<p class="poem">To follow knowledge like a sinking star,<br>
Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.</p>
<p>The great lines of the poet who was afterwards to write his
epitaph, might almost seem to have been inspired ten years before
by a prophetic prevision of that Homeric figure for whom 'old age
had yet its honour and its toil', and who, more truly than any
man then living, could re-echo that eternal heart-cry of the
explorer in every field of search, that</p>
<p class="poem">             all experience is an arch
wherethro'<br>
Gleams that untravelled world whose margin fades<br>
For ever and for ever when I move.</p>
<p>It was at the call of this insatiable longing that he went
forth to die, and it is for his loyal obedience to that summons
that the nation has placed him unhesitatingly among its heroes.
It is the one form of romantic service&mdash;for our patriotism
we can defend as 'practical'&mdash;which Englishmen appreciate.
The only war which they will wage 'for an idea' is the war
against the forces of nature for the prize of an undiscovered
world. How purely ideal is this warfare we have shown again and
again&mdash;in our indifference alike to the cost at which it is
prosecuted and to the material value of its gains. That
North-west Passage, on which the hearts of our Arctic voyagers
were so long set, was at last discovered; and its discovery was
wholly useless to the commerce of the world. Half a century has
nearly passed since then, yet this shadowy channel, varying
yearly with the caprices of the seasons and the drift of the
Polar pack, remains, and will remain, untried. No trader will
ever pick his difficult way through those silent ice-fields from
the Atlantic to the Pacific waters. For all its worth to mankind,
as measured by material standards, the much-desired passage might
as well have been the visionary Eldorado that seemed to beckon to
our seafaring ancestors of three centuries ago. But, even as the
spirit of the great Elizabethan mariners lived again in the
breast of John Franklin, so his place is with them in our
history, and his memory will live with theirs.</p>
