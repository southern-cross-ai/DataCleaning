<hr>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>One Christmas holiday, as I unhooked my knapsack at Barrenjoey
lighthouse, my host asked me in surprise if I had come all the way
on foot. Said he, "You don't mean to say you really <i>walked</i>
here? Why, it is 20 miles from Manly!"</p>
<p>As I had liberally spent more than an hour bathing on one of the
pretty beaches as I came along, and another hour over my lunch, and
was by no means fatigued on my arrival, it was more than likely
that one might have exceeded this distance, had it been necessary
to do so; indeed, 25 or even 30 miles may be cheerfully
accomplished in the day when occasion demands it, by anyone with
good health and average strength of body.</p>
<p>Walking for the mere joy of walking was not much in vogue in
Australia until recently, chiefly, I suppose, for the reason that
in the towns there is the ever-ready and inviting facility for
whirling about on wheels of one sort and another; while in the
country our four-footed equine friend, like Barkis, is always
willing, even if one must needs chase him a full mile across the
paddock in order to secure the means of performing a half-mile
journey. Such a proceeding is common enough in the country, where
it is considered undignified to walk, since it savours too much of
the Murrumbidgee whaler.</p>
<p>To have admitted having walked from daylight until dark is to
give yourself away as a downright vagrant, sundowner, or, if not
quite mad, to be suspected of having a bee in one's bonnet.</p>
<p>"But come, own up! Don't you find it dull and lonely?" asks the
sybarite of fashion and city life.</p>
<p>Dull, my dear friend? No; who could be dull in the clear
sunshine, at an altitude of 4,000 feet, with the wonga-wonga
singing to the tune of the rippling water down in the river
below?</p>
<p>"Well, but what object is there in tramping all these miles in
the bush? What do you gain in the end? Had I some reward for my
pains if I could pick up a shilling at the end of my journey, you
might induce me to go, but to walk for the mere walking&mdash;no
not for me! I prefer to sit in my easy chair at home and smoke my
pipe." Well, if walking and the open-air life are nothing to you,
there is much less reason in a good many of the vagaries of city
life. Stay at home my pessimistic friend, if you like, but "give me
the clear blue sky over my head, and the green turf beneath my
feed, a winding road before me, and a three hours' march to
dinner."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-04.jpg"><br>
(The Mirror of the Grose)</p>
<p>To have done a day's walk amid pleasant scenery&mdash;to have
spent ten or more hours in the open with one's limbs all aglow with
life, and the sublime wonders of the universe thrown in gratis, is
to my mind enough for quiet contentment and contemplative
enjoyment.</p>
<p>Drive in a motor car? No. My answer is that I don't want to be
hurled through the air like a projectile. I like to go off the
beaten track when and where I choose&mdash;take nature's
by-ways&mdash;climb over rocks&mdash;pierce through cool shady
glens and gullies or pursue the coast-line, wading, if needs be,
some shallow creek or inlet of the sea, or on occasion even cross a
river.</p>
<blockquote>Vhere not some pridges pe,</blockquote>
<p>As Hans Breitmann has it.</p>
<p>I have crossed a river six times in a single day's
march&mdash;the River Cox, for instance. "How did you get over
these rivers?" exclaims a townsman; reminding me of Robert Dick
when inquiring the distance and the way to Dalemore.</p>
<p>"Eh! Are ye gaun to Dalemore?"</p>
<p>"Yes,"</p>
<p>"And where cam ye frae?"</p>
<p>"Dunbeath."</p>
<p>"Did ye come frae Dunbeath the day?"</p>
<p>"Yes"</p>
<p>"An' where are ye gaun tae?"</p>
<p>"Thurso."</p>
<p>"Are ye gaun to Thurso?"</p>
<p>"Yes,"</p>
<p>"And did ye wide the river?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"An' are ye gaun to wide it again?"</p>
<p>"Widing" the river is sometimes a chilly business, especially in
cool autumn weather, but it has its charms and there is a spice of
adventure about it. Still, these wanderings do not require the
force of concentration and brain tension demanded in the handling
of a skittish motor-car, nor the dread of a punctured tyre. No,
perfect freedom can only be obtained by the use and proper
subjection of Shanks' pony&mdash;the gipsy life of the untrammelled
pedestrian.</p>
<p>If, my jaded and fagged friend of the city&mdash;if you would
venture upon a new experience, you will want to know where you can
go. Possibly you know only of the ordinary tourist resorts. Well,
Mr. Tompkins here sets before you some two or more scores of
interesting trips well within the reach of everybody.</p>
<p>Here are short and easily negotiable trips, occupying but a few
hours, which the author has verified from actual experience. The
practice is with him as well as myself, to construe the verb "to
go" into "to go afoot."</p>
<p>Given good health, a holiday, some few modest coins of the
realm, and a live companion, you will here find entrance into
Arcady, or the Cambewarra, which, I take it is geographically the
same; your midday meal is enjoyed in the open, and a clean bed and
plain fare at dusk in some quiet unpretentious village inn; at
break of day you start, and away you go with your swag and your
staff,</p>
<blockquote>While the winds up aloft whistle to a
tune.</blockquote>
<p>Sunny New South Wales affords numberless routes as diversified
and refreshing as the most fastidious could desire. Do you want the
mountain side, tablelands, wide stretching plains, forest, wild
rough country, fertile valleys, or Alpine scenery with snow; or a
fine stretch of coast-line bright with palms, and where the
banksias or eucalypts creep down to the mesembryanthemums lying on
the yellow sand, with a vast sandstone cliff looming in the middle
distance. Footer! Trotter! Biker! Rider! Whoever you are, you may
assuredly find all this in New South Wales. What more can you
desire, my gentle reader? As Richard Jeffries says, "There is the
sea below to bathe in, the air of the sky up hither to breathe, the
sun to infuse the invisible magnetism of his beams. These are the
three potent medicines that by degrees strengthen not only the body
but the unquiet mind."</p>
<p>But once out of the city, whither shall we go? There is the ever
attractive West with its mountains, rugged and blue. The sun
disappears in the west, and there seems to be a longing in the
heart of the traveller to follow the golden orb as he sinks beyond
the mountain ridges in a flood of crimson glory. No wonder that
from the ancients onwards to Columbus and the men of Devon, all
sought the Atlantis and the Hesperia of the west. So Katoomba,
Blackheath, Wentworth Falls, the Cox, and the Warragamba, the
Kanangra country, and the romantic Jenolan Caves all trend away
west. Nearer Sydney, and cheaply accessible, is the southern
National Park and its northern counterpart and rival&mdash;the
Kuring-gai Chase, with Newport, Bay View, Barrenjoey, Wamberal,
Terrigal Head, Gosford, and the Tuggerah Lakes.</p>
<p>To the southward what a number of charming places! So many that
it is not easy to choose. The Illawarra, Cambewarrra, Barrengarry,
Kiama, the Bulli and Macquarie Passes, Jamberoo, Kangaroo Valley,
Nowra, Berry, Coolangatta, Tomerong. The Wombeyan Caves, Bowral,
Fitzroy Falls, Picton, and the Burragorang and other valleys that
bring you again to the slopes of the Blue Mountains. Further afield
you have Ulladulla, Bodalla, Narooma, Tilba Tilba, Bega, Cooma,
Yarrangobilly, Kiandra, and the Australian Alps&mdash;the Snowy,
and Kosciusko himself.</p>
<p>Away north is another region with attractions all its own. The
Northern Rivers, Walcha, the Apsley Falls, Guy Fawkes, the Don
Dorrigo, the Mann, the Orara, and the Tweed; aye, and a hundred
other places claiming one's visit and attention. Truly there is no
dearth of beautiful spots, and we can safely promise the
adventurous walker in search of the picturesque, amply and abundant
picture travel in the wondrous land before us&mdash;the fair
Cambria of the South.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-05.jpg"><br>
(The Hotel Kosciusko&mdash;5,000 Feet up Australia's Highest
Mountain)</p>
<p>Thus far we see there are delightful places whereunto we may
walk; need we then ask ourselves, Why walk? The objects of the
pedestrian are health, change of air, freedom from the complex city
life, and its banal conventionalities. Life <i>en plein
air</i>&mdash;that life more talked about and read of by people
than realised or put into practice. It is yours dear reader, to
live for twelve hours daily in the invigorating open air if you
will, eight hours of rest and refreshing sleep, and the remaining
four for meals of Arcadian simplicity, go to make up the joyful
twenty-four.</p>
<p>Are these things not enough in themselves? The varied charms of
scenery we have already counted, but there is more besides, to
wit&mdash;the study of rocks, minerals, fossils, mosses, lichens,
fungi, and the unique forest flora of Australia, the birds, fishes,
aborigines, trout-fishing, photography, and what not, each
according to individual tastes.</p>
<p>Whosoever feels inclined to walk distances, such as we here
contemplate, must be in some sort of a condition before he aspires
to rank as a walker, "traveller," "sundowner,""Swaggie," or "weary
Willie." An American tramp says it is only necessary to cut your
corns and put on your old clothes, and not go fooling round with
physic, dumb-bells, and lifting machines before starting.</p>
<p>There are very few persons, young or middle-aged, who cannot do
10 miles a day; practice, perseverance, and well-shod feet will
soon extend this to 15 or 20, which is enough to satisfy any who
walk for pleasure. My experience shows that the ordinary townsman
leading, it may be, a sedentary life, will soon accomplish 20 miles
a day, at the pace of 3½ miles an hour, without much
difficulty.</p>
<p>The secret, if any, of getting into fine condition is simple
obedience to the laws of temperance in diet, partaking of such work
or exercise as anyone adopting any of the physical culture methods
now so popular may avail themselves of.</p>
<p>To walk 1 mile involves the expenditure of energy amounting to
17 foot-tons. An ordinary diet of a full-grown man is capable of
supplying from 300 to 400 foot-tons of external work, in addition
to the physiological work done inside the body, which may here be
left out of consideration; so, unless the man walks 20 miles, or
does equivalent work, he is foolishly using more food than he
requires; in other words, he eats because the meal-time comes round
and the dinner is set before him.</p>
<p>Such a practice ends in disaster and disease; hence the
advantage of walking, and all other forms of physical exercises,
for those who are glued down to office-stools in cities.</p>
<p>Then, up and away when holiday-time comes round! And if the
Hawkesbury sandstone is too rugged and barren, go further afield.
For general guidance, the counties of Cumberland, Camden, Cook and
Westmoreland contain numerous beauty spots all within easy distance
of Sydney: one of the choicest is the district of the Warragamba
River, readily approached from Penrith. It is from this river that
the Warragamba Walking Club derives its name. The river is a
continuation of the romantic Cox, and flows into the Nepean.</p>

<p>If the object of the tourist be to get from Dan to Beersheba
with all possible expedition, making no effort to gain any definite
knowledge of the geological character of the country through which
he passes, its products, and so on, then, indeed, rail, bicycle,
motor, or aeroplane will serve his purpose. It is fairly safe to
assume, however, that there are many tourists who require some more
satisfactory return for their time and money. To glibly run off the
names of districts and townships visited, of which you know only a
little more than a cat knows of conic sections, may serve to excite
the envy of less opulent friends. But in this, as in most things,
superficiality is a sorry asset. And hereabouts lies the secret of
the "winding roads and bridle tracks" fascination which, once it
has burnt in, so transforms the pedestrian tourist that he can
rarely again settle down to the monotony of consecutive days or
weeks at one of the legion of tourist establishments, even though
it may reasonably boast "all the comforts of a home," plus driving,
fresh milk, and new-laid eggs&mdash;not to mention other seductive
but more or less apocryphal allurements. When the spirit of the

<p>Then it is that reaching for his swag and billy, he sheds his
city garments and striding along now vigorously, now leisurely,
lights his camp-fire where and when he will. Every mile brings
something different; every day's programme is different from the
last. Mountain and valley, bush and bird, exist only for his
entertainment. Each tour is so sharply and permanently fixed in his
memory, that no matter the lapse of time, so soon as he presses the
button&mdash;lo! A fresh court in memory's picture gallery is
exposed for his enjoyment. And, incidentally, this is a common
experience of the old hand, in the strenuous intervals. As he draws
solace from his pipe in the stifling environment of bricks and
mortar, with the bush hunger heavy upon him, comes a recollection
of joyous days when he was privileged to obliterate his Me, and
become part of the Australian bush: to thread his way through
scented woods, amid the music of the birds, possessed of a
rapturous sense of irresponsibility: when there were no arbitrary
divisions of time; and, filled with the spirit of revolt, he did
not hesitate to pronounce civilization a desperate failure. "What
days were those, Parmenides!" No morning paper: no post&mdash;no
tram, train, or boat to catch. Sky overhead, mother earth under
foot, pumping God's pure air through his lungs, and halting to camp
at his own sweet will. Weary of limb at times, and blistered feet,
perhaps. But the ecstasy of it! The circumstance cannot be too much
emphasised that the walker gets right away from beaten
tracks&mdash;far from the haunts of sputtering motors, trams, and
trains. He may climb mountains and descend valleys, accessible to
none else but horse-men, guided only by cattle tracks. For
example&mdash;on such trips as the Burragorang Valley, Bell's Line,
Mounts Wilson and Irvine, Megalong Valley, and Shooters' Hill,
vehicular traffic is in part, quite out of the question, and on
occasion you may walk for the best part of a day without meeting a
member of the genus homo. Some attempt has been made to show the
extent to which the observing and imaginative faculties are
stimulated by walking tours, and their generally beneficial effect
on the health.</p>
<p class="center"><a name="ch-1-2" id="ch-1-2"></a>THE HEALTH VALUE
OF WALKING</p>
<p>This is manifest from the following excerpts, taken almost at
random, from the writings of recognised authorities on physical
culture. Thus J. Cuthbert Hadden:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Walking is the very best tonic that can be presented for
exhausted brains, weakened muscles, and worn-out nerves; it
strengthens the digestive organs, drives the blood away from the
tired brain, and is one of the best remedies for nervousness."</p>
<p>And Mr. Bernarr MacFadden affirms:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It is well to note that walking keeps one young. It delays old
age. It drives out old-age cells, makes every part of you throb
with life and health and strength. One of the youngest old men that
ever I saw in my life was a professional walker who claimed that he
had a habit of walking from 15 to 20 miles a day, and although a
man of nearly 60 years he had the complexion of a 16-year-old girl.
For those who are striving for health, or who are in the grasp of a
serious chronic disease, no exercise is quite so valuable as
walking combined with deep breathing. Walking is more especially
valuable for cases of this kind because he exercise is difficult to
overdo. If you simply stop when you are tired, nothing but benefit
can be derived from it. I do not mean by this that you should stop
at the very first moment that you feel the slightest twinge of
fatigue, for you can continue with benefit until you can actually
enjoy a rest."</p>
<p>A. Walker, the author of a series of interesting articles in
<i>Sandow's Magazine</i>, writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Now let us see what are the benefits which may be derived from
a walking tour. First of all, walking is a grand exercise, one of
the best there is; anyone who has the slightest knowledge of
physical culture will tell you this, hardening and developing as it
does the muscles of the legs, thighs, and loins; the lungs benefit
too, not only by the inspiration of purer air, but by the extra
work put upon them&mdash;one feels compelled to throw back the
head, and draw in a larger draught of the fresh, strong
air,&mdash;and the circulation is improved."</p>
<p>"Walking, fatiguing, you say," he continues. "Not a bit of it.
There is no finer tonic than a good, long country walk, clearing
the brain, brightening the eye, and bracing up the nerves as no
drug ever did yet. True, there may be a slight sense of physical
weariness, but even this is delightful when, at the end of a good
day's tramp you reach some comfortable old-fashioned hostelry, and
sitting down in the cool room, remove your dusty boots, and fall to
on the cold roast beef, the butter, the cheese, bread, and ale with
the vigorous appetite which a five hours' fast, and the fresh pure
air of heaven, and the exercise, have all combined to give you. And
then the deep, peaceful sleep at night, which sends you out the
next morning like a giant refreshed. Ah! Words cannot express it:
you must experience it yourself, my friend, to appreciate it
properly, and when once you do, the memory of it will cling to you
forever."</p>
<p>But let your own experience be your guide. Most Australians have
at some period of their lives engaged in one of the many branches
of athletics. And it is proof amounting to a mathematical
demonstration of the great value of walking, that athletes
everywhere, no matter for what event they be preparing, make it
part of their training. And they do this because it builds vital
power. The added vitality which it gives enables them to increase
the vigour of the muscles; it provides the essential thing we call
stamina. Medical men are agreed that by this exercise the blood is
cleansed of impurities, the eyes become clearer, the complexion
improved, and the flesh firmer.</p>
<p class="center"><a name="ch-1-3" id="ch-1-3"></a>METHOD OF
WALKING</p>
<p>Everyone believes that he knows how to walk, and none more so
than the man of limited experience. During many years' actual
practice on the track I have known many styles; but four only call
for mention, namely:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) The abnormally long stride of the walker who never gets out
of step&mdash;when alone.</p>
<p>(2) The short quick stride of the walker whose apparent aim is
to get to his destination about midday, who grows desperately
weary, and has developed a limp by the going down of the sun.</p>
<p>(3) The tediously slow, slovenly, no-method style; go a long way
in a long time; quite unsuitable for parties of more than one.</p>
<p>(4) The even, rhythmic, 3-miles-an-hour style (increasing to 4
as occasion demands). Neither anxious to race nor to lag; is going
nearly as fast and firm at sunset as at sunrise. Good for any
distance.</p>
<p>As may be guessed, the last is the method recommended. Of the
rest, No. 3 is the most unsatisfactory. My own experience is that
for thorough enjoyment of the tour no pace is equal to the steady 3
miles an hour. It enables you to see all that is to be seen, and
while it does not unnecessarily fatigue, cuts out a satisfactory
day's journey. It is worthwhile to remember that if you walk in a
slipshod, slovenly manner, if your movements are not regular, you
will tire quickly, and the venture will result in disappointment.
MacFadden says:&mdash;"When assuming the proper attitude the body
is always inclined forward while walking. Walking should be a
continual fall forward just as is running. Each step should save
you from a fall, and the body should always be inclined far enough
forward to insure a continuance of this position. The entire body
should always be erect, shoulders back, chest prominent, head back,
and eyes looking straight in front. Many are of opinion that
because an erect attitude is advised in walking, it is necessary to
swing the body far backward. This is a serious mistake."</p>

(At Stanwell Park)</p>
<p class="center"><a name="ch-1-4" id="ch-1-4"></a>FORMATION OF THE
PARTY</p>
<p>One of the most important details in arranging a walking tour is
the formation of the party. The trouble is that in the initial trip
you have to risk a lot, and your privilege of choice can only be
exercised at a subsequent date. Recognising and shrinking from this
difficulty, many walkers have advocated going alone. Notably Robert
Louis Stevenson. "Now, to be properly enjoyed, a walking tour
should be gone upon alone. If you go in a company, or even in
pairs, it is no longer a walking tour in anything but name; it is
something else, and more in the nature of a picnic. A walking tour
should be gone upon along, because freedom is of the essence,
because you should be able to stop and go on, and follow this way
or that, as the freak takes you; and because you must have your own
pace, and neither trot alongside a champion walker, nor mince in
time with a girl."</p>
<p>William Hazlitt, too, a considerable walker, preferred a party
of one in order to secure unanimity of opinion. He had "no
objection to argue the point with anyone for 20 miles of measured
road, but not for pleasure. If you remark the scent of a bean-field
crossing the road, perhaps your fellow traveller has no sense of
smell. If you point to a distant object, perhaps he is
short-sighted and has to take out his glass to look at it...There
is no sympathy, but an uneasy craving after it, and a
dissatisfaction which pursues you on the way, and in the end
probably produces ill-humour...I cannot see the wit of walking and
talking at the same time. When I am in the country I wish to
vegetate like the country. I am not for criticising hedgerows and
black cattle...Give me the clear blue sky over my head and the
green turf beneath my feet, a winding road before me, and a three
hours' march to dinner."</p>
<p>In sharp contrast to this, Laurence Sterne&mdash;who, by the
way, was not a walker, his "Sentimental Journey"
notwithstanding&mdash;affirms:&mdash;"let me have a companion of my
way, were it but to remark how the shadows lengthen as the sun
declines."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-10.jpg"><br>
(In The National Park)</p>
<p>And when you come to think of it quite a number of men of
letters have been enthusiastic walkers. Only to name a few. George
Borrow invariable went afoot. Carlyle in his youth looked upon
walking as a natural means of getting from one place to another.
For instance, you remember that on the occasion of his first visit
to Edinburgh he footed it in company of Tom Smail, and repeated the
feat several times alone. Samuel Taylor Coleridge&mdash;we have it
on the word of Hazlitt&mdash;"could go on in the most delightful
explanatory way over hill and dale, a summer's day, and convert a
landscape into a didactic poem or a Pindaric ode." And more
recently, and a greater walker than any yet named, was the late Sir
Leslie Stephen.</p>
<p>But to get back. Man is a gregarious animal, and although on
occasion it may be convenient to have none but yourself to consult
as to the scent of the bean-field, pace, variation of route, and
the several other things that may crop up, a party of two, three,
or four, if it consist of practised walkers of cheerful and
agreeable dispositions, who are accustomed to one another's little
ways, will be found to work well. Two is the handiest number, and
the party should rarely exceed four, as in some of the
out-of-the-way places it is difficult to get accommodation for a
greater number than four. Indeed a party of this strength will be
uncommonly lucky if it has not sometimes to occupy one
sleeping-room containing but two beds. For myself I prefer a party
of two.</p>
<p class="center"><a name="ch-1-5" id="ch-1-5"></a>EQUIPMENT.</p>
<p>A fixed rule should be to travel light. The question is not so
much what to take as what to leave. Means of carrying your
requisites is the first consideration, and choice may be said to
lie between the knapsack, rucksack, and swag. Of the first two, the
knapsack is much to be preferred. It is adjustable, rides high,
bringing the weight over the shoulders, and is so constructed that
it allows of the free passage of air between it and the back.
Unfortunately a serious difficulty confronts one at the outset.
Knapsacks of the kind described are neither procurable in Sydney
nor in Australia, as far as is known; and while they can be
purchased in London from 8s. upwards, the most definite quotation
to be got recently from a Sydney firm was "possibly as low as 30s.,
but perhaps 40s." The defect in the rucksack, which somewhat
resembles a postman's bag, is that it rides low, and, as a
consequence, the weight is thrown on the hips instead of on the
shoulders; also, it keeps one unpleasantly hot where it touches the
body. The drawback with the swag is that if one wishes to get out
the most trifling thing it must be unrolled, and, as in the case of
the rucksack, the free passage of air was not contemplated in the
design. For the purpose of construction all that is needed is a
piece of good American cloth one yard long by two wide, and four
saddle straps,&mdash;two to go round the swag, and two to swing it.
The swag should swing from the <i>right</i> shoulder and be
<i>balanced</i> by the nosebag over the <i>left</i> shoulder
(<i>vide</i> frontispiece). An unusually heavy swag is often swung
by means of a piece of stout new calico instead of a strap.
Individual taste must of course decide what to carry, so that you
travel light.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-11.jpg"><br>
(Through Sylvan Scenes Near Bulli)</p>
<p>Your travelling suit, exclusive of footwear, might consist of
undershirt, sweater, knickers and stocking, or pants, according to
inclination; coat, soft hat or cap, and belt and sheath-knife.
Additionally, the indispensable articles are a couple of light
undershirts, a couple of pairs of socks, pyjamas or other sleeping
garment, shaving and toilet requisites (only essentials); a small
tin box to contain small scissors, needle and thread, tube of
lanoline, piece of cotton wool, a few ounces of boracic powder. If
camping out be determined upon, a sleeping-bag will be required. A
sleeping-bag is much warmer and handier than an ordinary blanket or
rug, and is easily constructed, being merely a blanket or rug with
American cloth, or canvas cover, folded lengthwise and sewn
together at one end and at the side. Before getting in to the
sleeping-bag a bed of grass or leaves should be prepared, and a hip
hole dug out. One may imagine that the articles enumerated will
make a formidable swag, but its weight is inconsiderable. So soon
as one gets on the track his coat may be taken off and strapped to
the outside of the swag. To prevent inconvenience from rain a
macintosh cape or umbrella should be taken. The cape will pack away
if not wanted, and is easy to carry, but there is much virtue in a
homely gamp. It will protect head and shoulders from passing
showers, and if the rain be continuous but not sufficiently heavy
to hinder progress it is much cooler than the cape. The nosebag
might contain a supply of biscuit. Biscuit is much preferable to
bread, which soon becomes dry and unpalatable. To this might be
added dates or figs, a piece of fritz, or Frankfurt sausage,
cheese, and little calico bags containing a supply of tea, sugar,
and a mixture of pepper and salt. If the weather be cold, two or
three pea sausages, and some oatmeal might be added. In which case
it will be necessary to carry a spoon, and an extra billy. It
should be arranged so that one billy will fit into the other. It is
remarkable the taste one gets for water on a walking tour, and, if
the season be at all dry, a canvas waterbag or aluminium bottle
should be carried. A drinking vessel will fit into the billy, or
can be attached to the belt. The practice of the members of the
Warragamba Walking Club is to provision for two days, and replenish
stock at the stores or accommodation houses <i>en route</i>. And
they invariably carry a supply of a preparation of chocolate called
Plasmon, which, with a bit of biscuit, is an excellent thing to
take when travelling before breakfast.</p>
<p class="center"><a name="ch-1-6" id="ch-1-6"></a>FOOTWEAR.</p>
<p>Grit and pace may be irreproachable, but if one becomes footsore
all enjoyment is gone; and yet so many walkers have difficulty with
their feet that to be suitably clad is to be of the elect. A not
uncommon recommendation is to "get a good strong pair of Cossacks
with thick soles and plenty of nails." In spite of which there is
only one reliable guide. Every one must hold fast to that kind of
foot-wear which actual experience has shown to best suit his
particular case. The use of a very heavy boot means needless
overweighting: the essential thing is that the sole be solid. For
this reason I have for a considerable time used a specially built
sandal, and it has proved a great success. At the moment I have two
pairs, the older of which has been half-soled four times, and has
aggregated about 1,000 miles. The newer pair is a different in
style, being designed to exclude grit, and for use on muddy roads.
The advantages of a suitable sandal are that it is light, roomy,
and cool, and yet has the requisite solidity of sole. Particularly
it is roomy. The toes have ample space to spread out, with the
result that blisters are avoided. Its one defect is that it is not
suitable for use in rainy weather, and, consequently, a pair of
boots must always be carried.</p>
<p>But this need not be a worry. No walker of any experience goes
on the track provided with only one pair of boots. Pack the sandals
until the actual walking begins, and the pair of boots which are
worn when leaving the city will serve for the return, and also for
use should it rain. A pair of light slippers will add little to the
weight of the swag, and will be much appreciated when resting.
Whether sandals or boots are adopted, frequent change is one of the
surest means of preserving the feet. Neither the same socks nor the
same boots (or sandals) should be worn on consecutive days, and to
change twice each day is so much the better. And no opportunity of
bathing the feet&mdash;body too, for that matter,&mdash;should be
neglected.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-12.jpg"><br>
(Mosman's Bay)</p>
<p>The question of distance is important. If camping out one may
halt at discretion; but if depending upon accommodation it will
occasionally happen that an unusually long day's journey must be
accomplished. Except in the case of the Caves and Bell's Line,
accommodation at night is available in respect of all trips
embraced in this booklet, and no day's journey exceeds 25 miles.
Occasionally it is as low as 15, but in the majority of cases about
20 miles. Several of the "Warragambas" have been compelled on
occasion to exceed 30 miles in the day, but there is no poetry in
it, and if ventured by a novice might end in disaster; 20 to 25
miles is quite far enough for enjoyment, and 16 to 18 miles is no
mean performance. "Before setting out, have a definite itinerary,"
is the recommendation of all writers on walking trips, and
experience confirms this. Unless provision has been made for
camping out, and time is not limited, there must be fixed stages
for each of the three or four days. The great joy of being
unshackled in any way as to daily distance, pace, or route, is very
captivating as a theory, but, like "dossing" in wet sandstone caves
and abandoned huts with unsavoury companions of the road, it does
not work out in practice.</p>
<p class="center"><a name="ch-1-7" id="ch-1-7"></a>AN EARLY
START.</p>
<p>To start early is absolutely necessary. By this means the
annoyance of a tedious wait for breakfast is avoided, and however
confident the overnight promises may be, it is seldom ready at the
appointed hour. Besides, the luxury of walking through the crisp,
sweet morning air, with everything around waking into life, is
missed. It is possible to cut out some 4 or 5 miles before
breakfast. One resumes as fresh as at the start, and by midday such
progress has been made that a few hours' rest may be indulged
in.</p>
<p class="center"><a name="ch-1-8" id="ch-1-8"></a>WALKING FOR
LADIES.</p>
<p>The interest taken in walking by ladies, and the number of
parties one meets with and hears of on tour is remarkable. Placed,
as they are, at a considerable disadvantage in the matter of dress,
they, nevertheless, compass without inconvenience 15 to 20 miles a
day; less than 12 miles a day being accounted by many to be but a
small achievement. If it be girls in their teens, a mixed party in
which "dad" is included is the correct and convenient thing; but,
unfortunately, "dad" is not always available, in condition, or in
the mood, and parties consisting exclusively of ladies are by no
means uncommon. And what a merry company a mixed party is! I can
recall several such: Bell to Richmond, <i>viâ</i> Mount Wilson;
Wentworth Falls to Picton, <i>viâ</i> Burragorang; Katoomba to
Jenolan Caves, thence <i>viâ</i> Oberon to Tarana; Moss Vale to
Berry, <i>viâ</i> Kangaroo Valley; Moss Vale to Kiama, <i>viâ</i>
Fitzroy, Belmore and Carrington Falls, Robertson, and Jamberoo. The
merest peep at one of these expeditions must suffice: It is a
beautiful, clear, fresh forenoon in October. The party having
negotiated the long steep hill in front of Jenolan Caves in the
early hours, and breakfasted by the roadside, is making good
progress towards Oberon. As it makes its way through the scented
woodland the girls form the advance guard, tripping along
expectant, chatting merrily, and feeling that it is a joy to be
alive; the men smoke, and bring up the rear&mdash;and most of the
luggage. To observe the zest with which the girls enter into the
more or less commonplace incidents by the way&mdash;epoch-making
events to them&mdash;is to be rejuvenated. They remark on the rude
manner in which we prepare the chops for breakfast, and speculate
as to whether the mailman&mdash;to be met presently&mdash;will
bring the loaf ordered by wire from Jenolan for our lunch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-03.jpg"></p>
<p>Later, a farmer's wife is met driving a few ewes and lambs; she
is carrying a weakling. The maternal instinct is in evidence at
once. Everybody would like to nurse the lamb, and many terms of
endearment are lavished on it, while the good woman seems unable to
grasp the fact that the girls are from Sydney and are walking for
pleasure. At intervals a halt is called and the waterbag passed
around. And, finally, camp is pitched, and the party lunches under
a shady tree on the bank of the Duckmaloi. A camera being
invariably included in the outfit, I am able to present a few
pictures taken on different tours, and which show the girls as they
actually appear when "footing it."</p>
<p>There are several trips which cut up into suitable distances for
ladies and on which the necessary accommodation is obtainable.
While, under special conditions, it is competent for lady walkers
to undertake such delightful trips as Bell to Richmond, <i>viâ</i>
Mount Wilson and Kurrajong heights; Katoomba to Tarana, <i>viâ</i>
Jenolan Caves; Wentworth Falls to Camden or Picton, <i>viâ</i> the
Burragorang; it is regretted these routes cannot be recommended.
The ladies' country, <i>par excellence</i>, lies between the
southern tableland and the coast. Moss Vale to Nowra or to Berry;
Moss Vale to Albion Park, Jamberoo, Kiama, or Wollongong; Bowral to
Nowra or Berry, all fully described herein, and most of which cut
up into easy distances of 12 to 14 miles a day with adequate
accommodation. Observe what they embrace. Fitzroy, Belmore,
Carrington and Minnamurra Falls, Manning Lookout and Kangaroo
Valley, Barrengarry, Cambewarra and Berry Mountains, Robertson park
and Macquarie Pass. If I were asked to select one more suitable
than the rest for inexperienced walkers, without hesitation it
would be Moss Vale to Berry, <i>viâ</i> Kangaroo Valley. This trip
cuts up into easy distances, there is first-rate accommodation to
be had at a moderate cost, and it would be difficult to mention one
more beautiful. As regards one-day trips, it might be said that
almost all routes described in this class are practicable for
ladies. The easier ones being Waterfall to Audley; Guildford to
Baulkham Hills, <i>viâ</i> Prospect Reservoir; Penshurst to Audley,
<i>viâ</i> George's and Woronora Rivers; Pymble to Parramatta;
Ku-ring-gai Chase; Pymble to the Spit, <i>viâ</i> St. Ives and
French's Forest. Perhaps, even Hornsby to Baulkham Hills. However,
the distance is given in each case, and what may be accomplished
without fatigue is a matter for personal decision. Then there is
the important question of dress; and here mere man recognises the
limitations of his sex. The material should be as light as the
weather will permit, and the skirt short. Shoes or boots according
to inclination, but they must be well-fitting, with solid soles and
broad heels. Carry as little additional clothing as possible; it is
far better to send a change on ahead by rail or coach. For further
information in this relation see notes on Equipment, earlier.</p>
<p>What has been said in the foregoing pages may be epitomised
under these six headings, and the advice should be particularly
remembered:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Travel light.</p>
<p>(2) Make an early start, breakfasting on the track.</p>
<p>(3) Never wear one pair of boots, sandals, or socks for more
than one day; and half-day change is recommended as giving the best
results.</p>
<p>(4) Bathe the feet at every opportunity.</p>
<p>(5) Do not start on a long trip without some preparation.</p>
<p>(6) If not in the habit of regular sea-bathing the feet should
be soaked, as long as convenient, daily, in a solution of salt and
water. Cover the feet with common-soap lather or boracic acid each
morning just before starting.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-1" id="ch-2-1"></a>HALF-DAY TRIPS.</h3>
<p>A friend has urged that there is not a great deal to be said for
half-day (Saturday afternoon) walking trips. His contention is
substantially as follows:&mdash;The time at disposal is too short.
If one goes home to dinner it is impossible to get under way till
about 2 o'clock. In the walking season there is not much of the
afternoon left at 5 p.m., and when the days lengthen the weather is
too fatiguing. Much disagreeable rushing results, and, as a rule,
one is unsuitably clad. On Saturday afternoon there is not time to
penetrate far from the haunts of the crowd. The fear to encounter
stylishly dressed friends on tram, and elsewhere, clad in sweater
and sandals, leads to the encumbrance of much unnecessary and
altogether unsuitable clothing. And then there is no billy, and no
enjoyable midday rest and repast with the odour of the camp-fire
pervading everything.</p>
<p>This is more or less true, but half-day trips are only designed
as an introduction to serious walking, and it is not for a moment
pretended that they can be made as attractive as one, two, or three
day trips. Still, some are so circumstanced that Saturday afternoon
alone is available, and there are others who, timid of their
staying powers, would prefer in the first place to experiment in
journeys of that duration; and such being the case, some twelve
half-day routes, convenient to the city, are given.</p>
<p><a name="ch-2-1-1" id="ch-2-1-1"></a><b>No. 1.&mdash;Coogee to
Long Bay, <i>viâ</i> Maroubra Bay</b></p>
<p>Distance, about 5 miles</p>
<p>A delightful outing. Alight from Coogee tram at Dudley-Street ,
proceed up the hill to the right, and join Long Bay Road at the
cemetery. Arrived opposite Maroubra you may continue by road or
cross the beach and follow the cliffs round. The latter is much to
be preferred, as you are in interesting geological
country&mdash;see <a href="#ch-2-2-11">One-day trip, No. 11</a>. An
excellent swimming basin will be found at the southern side of Long
Bay, and an endeavour should be made to catch the high tide. From
the top of the gentle slope to south an excellent view of Coast
Hospital and the new Penitentiary is obtainable. By this time you
will be ready for tea. Refreshments are on sale at Long Bay, but
those of the elect will have provided themselves with a billy and a
little hamper. A frequent tram service obtains.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=

(The Spit Middle Harbour)</p>
<p><a name="ch-2-1-2" id="ch-2-1-2"></a><b>No. 2.&mdash;Manly to
Mosman Wharf, <i>viâ</i> The Spit.</b></p>
<p>Distance, about 7 miles</p>
<p>This is an easy trip as to distance, and quite within the powers
of the non-robust. The time actually occupied in walking would, of
course, be regulated by the inclination or speed of the walkers;
but the distance might be compassed easily in from three to four
hours. Manly steamers leave Circular Quay at frequent intervals,
and an excellent service obtains between Mosman and Sydney. If
desired, the walk may terminate at the Spit, and tram taken to
Mosman wharf or Milson's Point.</p>
<p><a name="ch-2-1-3" id="ch-2-1-3"></a><b>No. 3.&mdash;Watson's
Bay to Bondi Beach, by Military-road, or the Cliffs.</b></p>
<p>Distance, about 5 miles</p>
<p>This could be made a most enjoyable trip, to include a "dip' in
the surf or at Bondi baths, before taking tram to Sydney. Better
still, arrange with the ladies of the family, for whom the walk
would be perhaps, too fatiguing, to meet you at Bondi beach, with
provisions for an <i>al fresco</i> tea. As to the track: follow the
tram-line from terminus to a short distance past the light-house.
Here take the left-hand road; passing Watson's Bay Cemetery. Again
take the left-hand road after passing the Chinese garden&mdash;or,
if preferred, you may continue as far as the ostrich farm, and cut
across the bush to Military-road. If you are accustomed to walking
turn in to the cliff edge so soon as you pass the light-house and
follow the cliffs round to Bondi&mdash;see <a href=
"#ch-2-2-2">One-day trip, No. 2</a>. There is now an efficient
steamer service from Circular Quay and tram services from
King-street to Watson's Bay and to Bondi.</p>
<p><a name="ch-2-1-4" id="ch-2-1-4"></a><b>No. 4.&mdash;Watson's
Bay to Bondi Junction, by Old South Head Road.</b></p>
<p>Distance, about 6 or 7 miles.</p>
<p>Proceed as in trip <a href="#ch-2-2-3">No. 3</a>, except that
instead of turning to the left near the ostrich farm, keep right
ahead along Old South Head road by the Royal Sydney Golf Club's
links. The route may be varied by turning to the right at the old
club-house, and proceeding by O'Sullivan-road to the tram at Rose
Bay.</p>
<p><a name="ch-2-1-5" id="ch-2-1-5"></a><b>No. 5.&mdash;Parramatta
to Burwood (or vice versa) by Great Western Road.</b></p>
<p>Distance, about 8 miles</p>
<p>Take Parramatta return, inquire at Parramatta for Sydney-road.
There is not much to see, but the walking is good and it is an
ancient thoroughfare as we date things: its associations, if at
times grim, are not without fascination. As you pass through a few
cuttings you can easily recognise the work of the sullen and, there
appears to be little doubt, often brutally ill-used convict gangs.
Here rang out the urgent language of the pioneer bullock-driver,
and the whip crack of Cobb &amp; Co. Here, too, was the theatre of
the exploits of that famous repository of intelligence, the Flying
Pieman. And among other things, you will remember it was here that
Charles Darwin set out, on the 16th January, 1836 on his celebrated
trip across the Blue Mountains, the first stage of which "took us
to Parramatta, a small country town next to Sydney in importance."
An early number of the <i>Sydney Gazette and N.S.W.
Adviser</i>&mdash;the first newspaper printed in
Australia&mdash;contains a curious proclamation anent the
maintenance of this thoroughfare:&mdash;"In consequence of the bad
state of the road leading from Sydney to Parramatta, and the danger
of horses being lamed in the deep ruts near Sydney, it is here
directed that all public and private carts and wagons passing that
road (not otherwise loaded) do take a load of brickbats from the
brick-field and drop them into the places appointed by the overseer
of the roads...By order of His Excellency."</p>
<p><a name="ch-2-1-6" id="ch-2-1-6"></a><b>No. 6.&mdash;Centennial
Park.</b></p>
<p>Distance, 4 to 5 miles (or at discretion).</p>
<p>Enter the park at the intersection of Oxford-street and
Park-road, Paddington, and proceed to the refreshment pavilion.
From this point complete the circuit of the grand drive, and take
the avenue through the centre of the park, passing the gymnasium
and lakes, to Randwick gates. Randwick-Coogee tram to Sydney. Or
the park might be entered from Cleveland-street or Randwick gates,
the circuit of the grand drive made and the central avenue
taken&mdash;turning to the right across country at the old polo
grounds, and leaving the park at Ocean-street, Woollahra. Here the
tram to Sydney could be taken, or the journey extended to Edgecliff
by Ocean-street. This alternative route is merely a suggestion for
the guidance of persons unfamiliar with the Centennial Park.</p>

<p><a name="ch-2-1-7" id="ch-2-1-7"></a><b>No. 7.&mdash;Artarmon to
Drummoyne Tram, <i>viâ</i> Fig-tree (Lane Cove River), Hunter's
Hill, and Parramatta River.</b></p>
<p>Distance, about 6 miles.</p>
<p>A pretty and by no means fatiguing trip. The 1.10 and 1.40
Saturday afternoon boats from Circular Quay connect with 1.20 and
1.50 trains respectively. Either train gives ample time to walk the
distance without any haste, and to catch a reasonably early tram to
Gladesville Bridge. From Artarmon take Longueville-road, and
subsequently Burns Bay road, to Lane Cove River. Finger-posts at
the corner of Longueville and Gordon roads and at corner of
Longueville and Burns Bay roads will direct you. After crossing the
bridge at Fig-tree, continue by Joubert-street, Hunter's Hill,
turning to the right at the "Fig-tree Hotel." From here the
telephone wires will guide you to Gladesville Bridge. Fine views
are obtainable <i>en route</i> of Lane Cove and Parramatta Rivers,
of forest land, and, among other things, of St. Ignatius' and St.
Joseph's Colleges. Should you discover that you have misjudged your
"staying" powers, the journey might terminate at Fig-tree, and the
city reached per medium of Lane Cove steamer. Refreshments may be
obtained at Fig-tree, but if you have your billy and some
provisions, an excellent camping ground, with plenty of fuel, is
available at Parramatta River, near Gladesville Bridge.</p>
<p><a name="ch-2-1-8" id="ch-2-1-8"></a><b>No.
8.&mdash;Edgecliff-road, Bellevue Hill, and Rose Bay.</b></p>
<p>Distance, 4 or 5 miles.</p>
<p>Leave Rose Bay tram at Ocean-street, and proceed by
Edgecliff-road. In the first hundred yards&mdash;immediately behind
Edgecliff post office&mdash;is a remarkably fine harbour view, with
Double Bay in front, Darling Point on the left, and Point Piper on
the right. Edgecliff-road is about 2 miles in length and terminates
at Old South Head road. Keep right on, taking the left hand-road to
Woollahra Park. Some excellent views are obtainable from this
miniature park before continuing the walk by Victoria-road. This
will lead round Bellevue Hill to Rose Bay. When opposite "Kambala"
cross over to the new road skirting Scots' College. Here are
magnificent ocean and harbour views. At a point behind Scots'
College the road might be left and an interesting excursion made
through the bush to the O'Sullivan Road; this in its turn leads to
Rose Bay. Most of the country through which you have been walking
is the famous Cooper estate, a name that will not be unfamiliar if
by any chance you have friends who worship at the shrine of Henry
George.</p>
<p><a name="ch-2-1-9" id="ch-2-1-9"></a><b>No. 9.&mdash;Pymble to
Ryde, <i>viâ</i> Marsfield and North Ryde.</b></p>
<p>Distance, about 7 miles.</p>
<p>If Saturday afternoon, catch the 1.20 boat at Circular Quay.
This connects with the 1.32 train, which arrives at Pymble at 1.58.
Turn back from Pymble railway station, for about half-a-mile, as
though going to Sydney and take the road to the right just before
reaching the gasworks. In less than an hour's walk this will bring
you to the high-level bridge which spans Lane Cove River. There are
branch roads, but follow the telegraph line. This leads through the
orange-growing country, and in reality passes along the boundary
line dividing Ryde and Marsfield. Ryde railway should be reached in
time to catch the 5.39 p.m. for Sydney. The next train is at 6.31
p.m.</p>
<p><a name="ch-2-1-10" id="ch-2-1-10"></a><b>No. 10.&mdash;Rhodes
to Leichhardt, <i>viâ</i> Concord and Parramatta Roads.</b></p>
<p>Distance, about 7 miles</p>
<p>If Saturday afternoon be chosen for this trip, the 1.40 from
Redfern is a suitable train, and arrives at Rhodes at 1.53, giving
ample time for a leisurely return to Leichhardt. It is necessary to
notify the guard of your wish to leave the train at Rhodes. The
route is along Concord-road, which, at this point, is only a short
distance from the railway line, and is excellent walking, with
pretty patches of woodland and open golf country. In the fullness
of time Parramatta-road is reached, already mentioned in <a href=
"#ch-2-2-5">No. 5</a>. A frequent tram service is available from
Leichhardt.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=

<p><a name="ch-2-1-11" id="ch-2-1-11"></a><b>No. 11.&mdash;Ryde to
Parramatta, by Kissing Point Road and Dundas.</b></p>
<p>Distance, about 7 miles.</p>
<p>If there be not a long interval of dry weather this is a very
interesting walk, mostly through orange groves of limited extent,
but somewhat similar to Castle Hill. The 1.30 p.m., Saturday, from
Redfern reaches Ryde at 1.59, and the distance being less than 8
miles. One should catch the 5 or, at latest, 5.25 p.m. train at
Parramatta. The route is by Kissing point road, through Ermington,
Dundas, and Rydalmere. There is an alternative road nearer to
Parramatta River, by Subiaco and Rydalmere Asylum, but <i>viâ</i>
Dundas is recommended.</p>
<p><a name="ch-2-1-12" id="ch-2-1-12"></a><b>No. 12.&mdash;Pymble
to Fig-tree, Lane Cove River, <i>viâ</i> Hunter's Hill.</b></p>
<p>Distance, about 8 miles.</p>
<p>If this trip be made on a Saturday the 1.20 p.m. boat connects
with the 1.32 p.m. train at Milson's Point. This will put you down
at Pymble at 2 minutes to 2 o'clock. The walk might occupy three
hours or less. On arrival at Pymble turn back for a distance of
about half a mile, towards Sydney. Then take the right-hand
road&mdash;the indicator will direct. At a point 2 or 2½ miles from
Pymble the road crosses Lane Cove River. Look out for the indicator
at the top of the hill on the opposite side of the river, and take
Gladesville-road, turning to the left. There is no chance of
mistake from this point until Ryde and Gladesville roads intersect
at right-angles, about a mile from Fig-tree Wharf. Here take the
left-hand road, keeping St. Joseph's College on your right. If the
season be not too dry it is an easy and pretty afternoon's tramp,
making, as it does, an excellent round trip. If a whole day is
occupied, it is a good trip for ladies. In this case a start should
be made about 10 a.m., provision made to lunch <i>en route</i>, and
a leisurely pace will bring the party to Fig-tree at about 4 to
4.30 p.m., concluding with a pleasant run down Lane Cove River to
the city. As a matter of fact, the writer and his little girls,
aged 14 and 16, of average physique, accomplished this trip only
recently, and neither of them was in the least distressed. A start
was made one Sunday by the 10.15 a.m. boat from Circular Quay, and
the walk from Pymble commenced shortly after 11 o'clock. A rest of
two hours was taken for lunch at a pretty fern-clad gully about
half way, and the party was aboard the "Lady Hampden" at Fig-tree
at 4.30 p.m.</p>

Sundays the 8.30 a.m. boat connects with 8.45 a.m. train at
Milson's Point, and there is a train at 9 a.m. from Redfern.</p>
<p>On arrival at Hornsby, follow Peat's Ferry road to finger-post
indicating Galston-road&mdash;about a mile from Hornsby post
office. From this point the road passes through rugged picturesque
country, making a zigzag descent into Hornsby Valley, at the bottom
of which two streams of beautiful clear water are crossed by means
of substantial bridges. Having climbed some 3 miles by an easy
grade, the little village of Galston is reached; here a finger-post
reads&mdash;"To Hornsby 6½ miles. To Parramatta, 15½." The
character of the country has now changed, as by the touch of the
magician's wand, from the picturesque but almost sterile waste to
beautiful, cultivated, fertile slopes; the holdings in most cases
being well improved and prosperous looking. Lead us not into
temptation! Stimulated by early piety, and restrained by fear of
the law, one may meander without offence through tempting orange
groves laden with golden fruit of July and August, and, as the
golfers say, so adjacent that you could almost gather the fruit
without leaving the King's highway. Passing through Dural, Castle
Hill, of historic association, is reached, and away to the right
the sight easily penetrates to the foot of the Blue Mountains,
embracing in its survey the settlements around Riverstone, Windsor,
Richmond, Kurrajong, and Pennant Hills, which lies away to the
left.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-18.jpg"></p>
<p>This is historic ground! A century ago in this State justice was
grim and rugged, and if there was less pomp and circumstance about
the trial of the criminal, the agony of execution was longer drawn
out. Viewing Castle Hill to-day, with its prosperous looking houses
and square miles of orchards, it is curious to recollect that at
the period mentioned, it was not an infrequent occurrence for
condemned prisoners to be brought in solemn procession from
Parramatta to be executed here. A Castle Hill tram may be taken to
Parramatta. The total distance, Hornsby to Parramatta, is 22 miles,
and Hornsby to Castle Hill is 15 miles. This is recommended as one
of the most delightful one-day trips near Sydney.</p>
<p><a name="ch-2-2-2" id="ch-2-2-2"></a><b>*No. 2.&mdash;A Round
Trip: From intersection of Bayswater and Darling Point roads,
<i>viâ</i> Darling point, Double Bay, Bellevue Hill, Bondi Beach,
The Cliffs to The Gap, thence by New South Head road to Rose Bay
Wharf.</b></p>
<p>Distance, 13 or 14 miles.</p>
<p>By the robust this might be called a lazy day. But though near
to Sydney, and over familiar country, it is one of the most
interesting of the series, and if the day be bright some
magnificent cliff, ocean, and harbour panoramas may be viewed. The
route might be along Darling Point road past St. Mark's to
Branch-street, thence by the steps and Double Bay to new South Head
road; ascending Bellevue hill by the steep asphalt path, and
arriving eventually at Scots' College. Follow the road round the
college grounds and the path through the bush to O'Sullivan-road;
keep the golf links on your left, and across the sand hills to
Bondi beach. By this time you may be ready for a dip in the
sparkling Pacific and with a costume you may go right in. A few
hundred yards to the north are the famous natural basins at Ben
Buckler's Point, where one may bathe in security, and enjoy a
sunbath. Between this point and Bondi Fort is much that is of
geological interest. Here are fissures left by previously existing
volcanic dykes, and columnar structures developed in Hawkesbury
sandstone by contact with intrusive basalt, decomposed basalt in
the fissure known as Meriverie Pass, and some of the unaltered
basalt <i>in situ</i>. So soon as the fort is passed strike through
the scrub to the cliff, following which, if it be Sunday, you will
presently come on to a party of five or six well-bronzed males,
camped on a secluded and pretty spot on the cliff edge. It is what
is left of the sometime compact brotherhood known as the
"Amphibians"&mdash;a sect, apparently, of sun and sea
worshippers&mdash;engaged at the weekly celebration of their mystic
rites.</p>
<p>Camp might be made here for lunch. Any of the "Amphibians" will
point out the Matting, probably the most dizzy and daring
fisherman's path to be found on our coast; if path it may be
called, seeing that the bottom of the cliffs, which at this point
are about 300 feet in height, is reached partly by means of rope
ladders suspended from iron spikes driven into the sandstone. Still
following the cliffs and approaching Diamond Bay attention will be
attracted by an obelisk, the inscription on which explains its
purpose. At this spot some thirty years ago Jas. Pillars, B.A.,
aged 41 years, met his death by falling from the cliff. And in this
connection the writer once had a curious experience. In company
with some friends he had been driven by a passing shower to seek
shelter of a sandstone cave near by; so also had another wayfarer.
Not unnaturally the conversation turned on the monument, and the
stranger at once excited interest by the statement that he had
known Mr Pillars, and was present when he met his death. Mr.
Pillars had been his tutor; they had gone out cliff-climbing, and,
disregarding special warning, Pillars had trusted the weathered
sandstone, and had met his death by its giving way. He was seen to
strike the rocks at the bottom, turn over, and was then swept out
by a sea. No; his body had never been recovered. On the obelisk you
read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>He went down a precious argosy at sea&mdash;<br>
The world may never know the wealth it lost,<br>
When he went darkling to his tearful tomb,<br>
So might in his undeveloped force&mdash;<br>
With all his crowding unaccomplished hopes;<br>
Unuttered wealth and glory of his soul.</blockquote>

(Hornby Light, South Head)</p>
<p>Continuing north two fishermen's cliff descents&mdash;Buckley's
and Oby West are passed&mdash;and crossing a pretty little picnic
resort, called Rosy Gully, is the ascent of the hill at back of
Watson's Bay cemetery. At the highest point on the cliff is another
fishermen's descent, called Blackfellow, which takes rank next to
the Matting for difficulty and danger. In fact, at one point it has
a drop of about 60 feet down the perpendicular face of the cliff,
which is greater than either drop at the Matting. An old visitor to
the locality will be familiar with the Lighthouse and Gap, and
immediately bear away to the left along New South Head road to Rose
Bay, passing <i>en route</i> the convent of the Sacred Heart, a
monument to the architectural skill of the late Mr, Horbury Hunt;
Vaucluse estate, the sometime home of the Wentworths, and final
resting-place of the great William Charles Wentworth, the moulder
of our Constitution. At any point along the road the tram is
available for return to Sydney.</p>

<p>FARE.&mdash;To Pymble&mdash;1st, 11d.; 2nd, 8d. Manly to Sydney,
4d.</p>
<p>The 8.30 a.m. boat, Circular Quay, connects with 8.45 at
Milson's Point (Sunday), and the 7.30 a.m. boat connects with the
7.45 at Milson's Point (week-day). Inquire at Pymble for the road
to St. Ives. With the exception of the first few miles, which is
through fertile orange-growing country, this route is the reverse
of that followed on the Castle Hill trip. But for more than half of
its distance it has the advantage of being out of the beaten track.
At St. Ives the road leads into the native bush, and if the journey
is made in the early spring the bush is resplendent with every
variety of wild flower. Sugarloaf Hill is the only climb. Extensive
views of hill and ocean are obtainable from the ridges. The road
divides before reaching Foley's Rocks&mdash;the better route
joining the Pittwater-road at Rocklily, and the other at Narrabeen
near the bridge, and, if you have been thoughtful enough to bring a
bathing costume a dip on the beach will add some vim to your step
on the home stretch to Manly. In an ordinary season water is
plentiful <i>en route</i>. From Pymble to Narrabeen the distance is
16 or 17 miles, and the total distance to manly is about 24 miles.
If not in good walking condition, the coach service may be availed
of at Narrabeen.</p>

<p>There is no Sunday train to Waterfall. The 8.30 South Coast
train will serve on any week-day. Anyone at the station will direct
you. Just past Waterfall railway station the road plunges away to
the left into National Park, and about half an hour's walk leads to
within a few yards of the depression into which, in the rainy
season, the little creek leaps&mdash;whence the name Waterfall.
From here the road gently descends through a splendid forest of
turpentine to the freshwater river, crossing Bola Creek and many
pretty brooks <i>en route</i>. For the last 4 or 5 miles follow the
course of the Hacking River along the "Lady Carrington Drive,"
which has been described as a "vast and glorious avenue from end to
end." This is a trip well within the walking powers of ladies,
especially if the whole day be given to it. There is a fairly
frequent train service from National Park platform from the first
week in September. During the winter months trains&mdash;Wednesday,
6.40 p.m.; Saturday, 3.5, 6.3, and 7.30 p.m.</p>

<p>If a week-day, the 7.30 a.m. boat connects with the 7.45 train
at Milson's Point; if a Sunday, the 8.30 a.m. boat connects with
the 8.45 at Milson's Point. Bear away to St. Ives as in the
<a href="#ch-2-2-3">Pymble-Manly trip, No.3</a>. At a point about 4
miles beyond St. Ives, and 6 miles from Pymble, leave the
Narrabeen-road by a road which intersects it at right-angles, on
the right-hand side, at the corner of a paddock. Care should be
taken here, as there is no finger-post, but examination will show
that a surveyor's peg, quite close to the ground, at intersection
bears the words "Spit-road." Except the first few miles, the track
is through bushland, with here and there a homestead, and for the
most part free from bicycle and motor. At the brick kilns take the
right-hand road. Here again the question of condition crops up; if
"going strong," the walk might be extended to Mosman Bay wharf.</p>
<p><a name="ch-2-2-6" id="ch-2-2-6"></a><b>*No. 6.&mdash;Audley to
Wattamolla (National Park).</b></p>
<p>Distance, 20 miles.</p>
<p>FARE.&mdash;Return, National Park&mdash;1st, 1s. 6d.; 2nd,
1s.</p>
<p>An excellent trip, the occasional roughness of the bridle track
being more than compensated for by the feeling of being right away
from the dusty macadamised roads, more or less crowded with
traffic. Wattamolla is situated on the South Coast, between Port
Hacking and Garie Beach, in the National Park reserve. It is 10
miles from the train terminus at National Park. The 6.25 a.m. from
Sydney, on Sunday, is the best train. This will set you down at
National park about 7.31, and Wattamolla should come into view
between 11 and 12 o'clock. Finger-posts have been placed at
important points, and the track is easily found. Two or three hints
will be of use. Having got so far as the boat-shed, National park,
take the Military-road up the hill, on the opposite side of the
river, and reject all left-hand tracks until you reach a point
about 2½ miles distant. Here take the left-hand track; the one to
the right leads to Garie Beach. At the small bridge a few miles
further on, the left-hand track leads to Jibbon Beach, and the
right to Wattamolla. Presently, on the top of the ridge, the old
Clifton road&mdash;a track now for the most part overgrown&mdash;is
crossed and the ocean comes into view. A gradual descent of a
couple of miles, bearing to the left, brings you to Wattamolla, an
ideal spot for a few days' camp. It has a nice little beach, safe
salt-water basin inside for bathing, two pretty waterfalls, and
abundance of freshwater and fuel. Moreover, access is just
sufficiently difficult to limit the number of visitors. If camping,
some mosquito net should be included in the outfit, as the local
breed is large grey and businesslike. If out for the day only, one
may bathe, lunch, rest for about three hours, and on return catch
the 7.30 p.m. train at National park. The "billy" might be boiled
and some refreshment taken at "Flat Rock" crossing about half-way
on return journey, as it will be late when Sydney is reached.</p>

economy, and alight at Hurstville, and proceed to Tom Ugly's Point
punt. This road is well marked, finger-posts being stationed at all
important points. Go to Cronulla first, then to Port
Hacking&mdash;Burraneer Bay wharf&mdash;and, finally, to
Sutherland. The roads throughout are well made, and maintained in
good condition; too good in fact for walking, as the track is a
favourite one with cyclists, and with everyone who owns or can hire
a trap. For a considerable distance the fine country known as the
Holt-Sutherland estate is passed through. Apart, entirely, from the
attraction it offers to fishermen, there are few places more
picturesque than Port Hacking and its attendant
bays&mdash;Burraneer, Gunnamatta, and Yowie. The 5.20 p.m. on
Saturday, or the 5.23 p.m. on Sunday from Sutherland, reaches
Redfern at a convenient hour.</p>

<p>FARE.&mdash;National Park, return&mdash;1st, 1s. 6d.; 2nd,

<p>Ask for National Park return, and alight at Penshurst. If it be
Saturday or Sunday, the 8.32 and 8.10 a.m. are suitable trains, and
give ample time to catch the 6.3 p.m. (Saturday), or the 5.14 p.m.
(Sunday), at National Park. Take Forest-road to the punt, George's
River, on which the passage is free. Some 2 miles from the river is
the table-land on which is situated a little settlement called
Menai&mdash;sometime Bangor&mdash;and the track now becomes heavy
and sandy. Inquiry should be made at Menai for the turn off to
Heathcote. This occurs at a point 2 miles further on, and bears to
the left down the range to Woronora River. Very great care must be
taken, as it is but a bridle track, and the turn off marked "To
Heathcote" might easily be missed. In a short time a roughly formed
track is picked up, which leads to the river crossing, a wild but
picturesque spot, convenient to lunch at and there is an inviting
hole in the Woronora for a dip. From the river to Heathcote is a
well-formed but quite unused road of somewhat steep grade. The
local story is that the work was carried out by the unemployed at
some remote period, and that the vote becoming exhausted it was
never finished. After passing "Homelea," take the track to the
left, and in a few minutes Illawarra-Sydney road will be reached.
Take train either at Loftus Junction or National Park. If at the
latter, take the right-hand track between the 20th and 19th mile
posts, and very soon the platform will be in sight. This trip might
be reduced to about 15 miles, if done any week-day, by taking train
to Heathcote and walking back to Penshurst, or vice versa.</p>

<p>If Saturday, take the 8 a.m., and if Sunday, the 9.42 a.m. at
Sydney station. These trains reach Liverpool at 8.51 and 10.40
respectively. This is a popular track with cyclists, but it can
only be recommended to pedestrians on the score of accessibility;
the road is good, but the country is to a large extent
uninteresting. Shortly after leaving Liverpool, Lansdown Bridge is
crossed. This structure is worthy of more than passing notice. It
spans Prospect Creek, is convict work, and is constructed of
massive blocks of Hawkesbury sandstone. The builders, like Carlyle
senior, built for eternity. Nearing the scattered village of
Bankstown, where poultry-raising appears to be staple industry, you
get away from the depressing hungry-looking ti-tree. Box and
ironbark are met with, and the country generally improves. From
here on there is very little that calls for remark. The way lies
through piles of bricks and mortar, which, though no doubt the
outward and visible sign of wealth and civilisation, are, to the
walker, destitute of the freedom and charm of the "scented
woods."</p>

<p>A start should be made at 8 a.m. and the walk proper commences
at Rozelle post office, this point being reached by Balmain tram.
It is an excellent trip, especially from Gladesville bridge, the
one defect being that one is seldom far from a main thoroughfare.
Orchards are again in evidence. The character of the country about
Ryde, and especially about Eastwood and Carlingford is very similar
to Castle Hill and is wonderfully fertile. To anyone accustomed to
the coast from South Head to Botany, and the hungry hills and flats
near the metropolis on the Western, Southern, and Illawarra railway
lines, it is a land of enchantment. There is no difficulty about
finding the track. Go first to Ryde, then to Eastwood and
Carlingford, and on to Parramatta. Finger-posts are plentiful. If
it be Saturday, you may catch the 5 p.m. at Parramatta; if Sunday,
the 4.55 or 5.30 p.m., reaching Sydney at a convenient hour.</p>

<p>Distance, 14 or 15 miles.</p>
<p>FARE.&mdash;La Perouse to Sydney, 5d.</p>
<p>To Long Bay Cemetery there is a choice of two routes; either is
interesting, and the distance by either route is about the same. If
choosing that <i>viâ</i> Centennial Park and Randwick, a start
should be made from the Paddington entrance to the Park; if
<i>viâ</i> Waverley Park, Bondi Junction is a suitable starting
point. The routes join at Long Bay Cemetery. On arrival at
Maroubra, it is better to cross the beach, in preference to
continuing by road, and opportunity might be taken to have a surf
dip. Just here one of the sights of the trip should be pointed out.
At the head of a small bay, between Maroubra Beach and Long Bay, a
dyke of undecomposed basalt enters the sea, and the sandstones have
been altered into the most perfect examples of quartzite that are
known about Sydney. In this connexion the Rev. J. Milne Curran
says:&mdash;"The aboriginals were aware of the nature of this
stone, and used it to make skinning-knives. This quartzite is, in
places, stained by iron oxides to a rich chocolate brown, and on
first sight resembles the iron-stained quartz of some auriferous
reefs. Even miners have been misled by this similarity, and worked
here for some time sinking and driving." In the season wild flowers
in great variety may be gathered, and many spots will recall
boyhood expeditions in quest of "fivies," and other popular native
delicacies.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-22.jpg"><br>
(Long Bay)</p>
<p>A beneficent State has constructed a swimming basin on the south
side of Long Bay, and here another dip may be had, and the billy
boiled. From the ridge to the south a splendid view is obtainable
of the Coast Hospital and Leper Lazaret, and a bridle track to the
left of the Penitentiary leads to the tram line, which may be
followed to La Perouse. Apart from its historic interest, which is
considerable, it is doubted if there be any spot on the coast where
a few hours can be more pleasantly spent than at La Perouse, with
its beautiful beaches and grassy slopes. Return to the city is
possible <i>viâ</i> Botany and <i>viâ</i> Kensington; the latter
route being the more pleasant.</p>

<p>Baulkham Hills to Parramatta, tram fare, 3d.</p>
<p>On Sundays trams leave Baulkham Hills at 10 minutes to the hour,
and on week-days at 14 minutes to the hour.</p>
<p>Before starting on this trip a permit should be got from the
Secretary to the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage,
to follow the course of the canal from near Guildford to prospect
dam. This makes the walk much more enjoyable; and permission to do
this is rarely, if ever, refused to a responsible person. Of course
the road may be followed, but to do this is less agreeable and less
interesting. If a week-day, take the 8.23 a.m. at Sydney; if a
Sunday, the 9.42 a.m. As to the Sydney water service, every body
does not know, perhaps, that our daily consumption of water is
about 30,000,000 gallons; that the service cost originally about
£4,000,000; that Prospect dam was constructed in the middle
eighties, and its height is 85 feet; that its superficial area is
1,266 acres, and its capacity 11,029,180,000 gallons; that its
greatest depth is 77 feet, and its height above sea-level 100 feet.
To the right on nearing the dam is a remarkable mass of rock, which
is being quarried. The country rock is Hawkesbury sandstone and
shales. Commenting on this Mr. C.S. Wilkinson, a late Government
Geologist, says:&mdash;"Penetrating these formations are dykes and
masses of igneous rock, varying from a dense basalt to a
coarse-grained hornblendic greenstone. At Prospect these rocks form
a continuous and irregularly shaped hill, which attains an
elevation of 430 feet above sea-level. From its summit near
Greystanes a very commanding view is obtained of the surrounding
country, embracing the city of Sydney, Parramatta, Campbelltown,
and the Blue Mountains." Pressing onward, past the Lawson Estate
homestead, you reach the Great Western road; turn to the left
towards Penrith from a short distance, taking the road to the right
near the old milestone&mdash;"Sydney XX&mdash;Penrith XIII." This
is an excellent place to lunch.</p>
<p>The quaint old church on the hill, which is passed presently, is
worthy a few minutes' inspection. It is St. Bartholomew's Church of
England, Prospect, is convict built, and, as the stone in the
tower-wall testifies, was erected in 1842. In the pious but
insanitary fashion of a century ago, and much later, the "narrow
cells" of the "forefathers of the hamlet," and more or less
pretentious vaults of the Lawsons, Westons, Cleeves, and other
families, are clustered round the church. They are quite unlike,
and yet St. Bartholomew's suggests St. James', Sydney. The old
building has weathered well, but several large rents show that its
foundations might have been more truly set. Pursuing the journey,
cross the Blacktown-road and proceed right ahead by a bush track,
to the Seven Hills road, which will take you through the locality
of that name. Passing through a wonderfully fertile country
abounding in orange plantations you reach Baulkham Hills in time
for the 4.50 pm. Tram. This is worth recollecting. At a point 2
miles from Baulkham Hills is a finger-post with the legend "To
Windsor-road, 2 miles." Do not take this road&mdash;it goes to
Baulkham Hills, but adds 2 miles to your journey. Go straight
ahead.</p>

Milson's Point; on Sundays the 8.30 a.m. boat joins the 8.45 train.
These are suitable trains. On arrival at Pymble, take Lane Cove
road, towards Gordon, and turn to the right just before reaching
the gasworks, half-a-mile from Pymble railway station. For the
first 2½ to 3 miles the road is on the top of the ridge, which
commands some fine views. After crossing Lane Cove River by the
high-level bridge, keep straight ahead, following the telegraph
line. Gladesville-road branches away to the left a short distance
from the bridge. From this on there will be no difficulty about the
road, which, for the most part, passes along the boundary dividing
Marsfield from North Ryde. At Ryde railway station take Kissing
Point road. This proceeds through Ermington and Rydalmere, and
Dundas, to Parramatta. From North Ryde to destination the route is
through orange orchards, and if the trip be taken in July, August,
or September, it will be found very enjoyable. There are no hills
to climb worth mentioning, as it is a gradual descent from 449
feet, at Pymble, to 50 feet above sea-level at Parramatta, and may,
therefore, be estimated an easy day's walk. There are several
convenient trains by which to return to Sydney. This journey should
not be essayed after a long spell of dry weather, as the roads from
Ryde to Parramatta become too dusty to render walking
agreeable.</p>

<p>This is a nice easy one-day trip, and is one of the very few
round trips at present practicable at Kuring-gai Chase, a region
famous for its well-preserved specimens of aborigines' art, its
rugged, picturesque scenery, house-boat expeditions, and fishing
grounds. Take the 8.30 a.m. boat to Milson's Point: this connects
with the8.45 Hornsby train. Arrived at Hornsby, follow Peat's Ferry
road for a couple of miles, being careful to turn to the right at
the point where Galston-road branches away to the left. Shortly
after passing the 16-mile post cross the railway line at the gates.
So far as the money at their disposal has allowed, the trustees
have done good work. Tanks of drinking water and fireplaces have
been provided <i>en route</i>, and are of special service at Cockle
Creek bridge, about half way&mdash;a suitable spot for
refreshments.</p>

<p>For the first few miles at Hornsby end, and again after climbing
the zigzag going towards Turramurra, the country is sterile and
uninteresting&mdash;characteristic New South Wales coastal hills.

7.32 p.m. Saturday trains for return from National Park.</p>
<p>At Otford pick up a bridle path near the mouth of the railway
tunnel; this runs up and along the ridges to the old
Clifton-road&mdash;now merely a disused track. If any difficulty be
experienced at Otford in finding the route, inquiry should be made
at the sawmill. As a number of tracks, leading to Garie Beach and
other places, cross and branch from Old Clifton road, it is worth
while to recollect that the course is right along the top of the
ridge. Reject all tracks which descend the cliffs, unless wishing
to visit Garie or Wattamolla. Both are lovely spots, especially
Wattamolla; but if either be included it will add some 4 miles to
the journey&mdash;making the total for the day 21 or 22 miles. So
it is merely a question of inclination and staying power. If you
determine not to visit either place, follow the Old Clifton road to
Wattamolla finger-post, and then take the track bearing away to the
left. This will bring you across Flat Rock Creek, and eventually to
the military road leading down the hill to the dam and boat-house.
It is a very attractive day's journey for several miles by bridle
path, with the ocean on the right and beautiful fragrant woodland
on the left. At a small cleared patch near an old trig. Cairn, a
few miles from Otford, go over to the edge of the cliff&mdash;50 to
60 yards&mdash;and there opens a magnificent view of the chain of
ocean beaches, and the bold coastal promontories. If it be desired
to do this trip on Sunday, you must go to Otford on Saturday
afternoon; there are two trains. Accommodation is, however,
difficult to obtain at Otford. It might be mentioned that there is
an alternative route&mdash;Otford to Audley&mdash;distance about
the same. Pick this road up opposite Otford railway station, and it
leads through the big timber country to the Lady Carrington
Drive.</p>

out of Helensburgh is a very fine sight known as Kelly's Waterfall.
It is only some 300 yards from the road; a fence running at right
angles to the road, just past a slaughter-yard, will take you right
to the Falls; but inquire at Helensburgh. The view is well worth
the trouble. Within a few yards of each other two creeks
precipitate themselves over a ledge into a ravine several hundred
feet deep. The first fall is about 100 feet. Having regained the

<p class="center">First Day</p>
<p>This is a fine week-end trip, and may be recommended, at least
on the score of variety. A steamer leaves Hawkesbury on Wednesdays
and Saturdays on the arrival of the morning train from Sydney, and
reaches Wiseman's Ferry about 1 o'clock. This means a three to four
hours' trip up the beautiful and picturesque Hawkesbury, amid rural
scenes of exquisite beauty. An adequate appreciation of the
Hawkesbury is, perhaps, only arrived at after an opportunity of
comparing and contrasting its charms with those of a stream of its
class elsewhere. A few months ago, in company with a friend, I
tramped over a good deal of the tourist part of Tasmania. Among
other excursions from Hobart we made the lovely New Norfolk trip,
and as we sat on the deck of the more or less fast river boat, very
naturally the relative merits of the Hawkesbury and the Derwent
were discussed. My deliberate opinion, given for what it is worth,
is that for variety, picturesqueness, and subtle charm the
extravagantly-praised Derwent is, with one exception, hopelessly
inferior to the Hawkesbury. The exception is the very beautiful,
but extremely limited, stretch of river&mdash;perhaps three
quarters of a mile&mdash;at New Norfolk. But this beauty is of a
kind quite different from the rugged environment of the
Hawkesbury&mdash;approximating our Paterson, with its low fertile
banks&mdash;and its character, therefore, hardly permits a fair
comparison. At Wiseman's Ferry accommodation is obtainable at the
hotel&mdash;an old-fashioned stone building which was once the home
of Solomon Wiseman, from whom the place takes its name, and is now
the Hawkesbury Hotel or boarding-house. There is ample time during
the afternoon to cross the ferry and enjoy the lovely view of the
Macdonald River Valley, and to visit the boxes on top of mountain,
from which altitude&mdash;about 800 feet&mdash;a view of unusual
grandeur spreads out.</p>
<p class="center">Second Day.</p>
<p>An early start is recommended&mdash;breakfast and lunch on the
track. Distance to Windsor about 26 miles. There is a choice of
three roads: the river road passing Letts Vale, Lower Portland,
Sackville Reach, and Wilberforce is recommended. However, if, for
the sake of the view, you take the hill road, it is advisable to
turn in to Sackville Reach just past the 16-mile post. Tea at
Windsor at the river, and, if Sunday, the train leaves for Sydney
at 7.37 p.m.: if a week-day except Saturday, it leaves at 4.26 p.m.
On Saturday there is an additional at 8 p.m., which reaches Sydney
at 9.38 p.m.</p>

<p>There being no train to Sydney from Nowra on Sunday night,
Saturday is a convenient day to commence this journey. Take the
2.28 p.m. or the 6.10 p.m. to Moss Vale; the former preferred,
which reaches Moss Vale in time to arrange accommodation for the
night. Care should be taken to ask for a "Moss Vale-Nowra"
tourist's ticket.</p>
<p class="center">First Day.</p>
<p>Start not later than 6 a.m., if it is desired to experience the
joyous sensation of a brisk walk through the fresh morning air of
the tableland; breakfast and lunch on the track. Fitzroy Falls,
situated quite close to the road, are passed 11 ½ miles from Moss
Vale, and Kangaroo Valley must be reached for tea. Distance for the
day, 22 miles. The road to the top of Barrengarry Mountain is
level, and from there mostly down hill. There are two accommodation
houses three quarters of a mile on the Moss Vale side of Fitzroy
Falls, where lunch could be had if desired; but it is reached
rather early in the day, if it is desired to make Kangaroo Valley
for tea; and, as will be seen, fits in much better when the trip
occupies three days.</p>

(Kangaroo Valley)</p>
<p class="center">Second Day.</p>
<p>Early start as before, breakfast on the track, and Nowra, 13
miles, can be reached, comfortably, by midday. You may then return
to Sydney by the 1.40 p.m. or 4.15 p.m. train; but the earlier one
is much to be preferred. Cambewarra Mountain is a stiff climb, but
from its summit to Nowra is easy going. Altogether it is a light
trip, and splendid views are got from Barrengarry and Cambewarra
Mountains. In the early spring the walk down Cambewarra, mid
avenues of tree-fern and wild flower, is one of unique loveliness.
Provision will require to be made for three meals on the track. For
hints as to what to take, see <a href="#ch-1-5">Equipment, Part I,

<h3><a name="ch-2-6" id="ch-2-6"></a>THREE-DAY TRIPS.</h3>
<p><a name="ch-2-6-1" id="ch-2-6-1"></a><b>*No. 1.&mdash;Wentworth
Falls to Picton (or Camden), <i>viâ</i> Cox's River and Burragorang
Valley.</b></p>
<p>Distance, about 60 miles.</p>
<p>Estimated cost as low as 20s. Thus: 1st class return, Wentworth
Falls, 10s 2d.; accommodation <i>en route</i>, 14s. 11d.= 25s. 1d.
2nd class return, Wentworth Falls, 5s. 1d.; accommodation <i>en
route</i>, 14s. 11d.= 20s.</p>
<p>The 4.55 p.m. on Friday reaches Wentworth Falls at 7.8 p.m.
Wilson's Hotel is the most convenient.</p>
<p class="center">First Day.</p>
<p>Wentworth Falls to Cox's River, 23 miles. A day-break start is
advised&mdash;breakfast and lunch on track. Leaving the hotel
follow the Great Western road for about a mile as if going to
Sydney. A finger-post here indicates the way across King's
tableland and past the Queen Victoria Consumptive Homes. To a
stranger the track is bad for water, and a supply should be got at
Wentworth Falls. McMahon's, Cox's River, has to be reached for tea.
A post-card should be addressed to Mr. Thomas McMahon, Cox's River,
<i>viâ</i> Burragorang, a few days in advance, mentioning the
number he may expect. As the McMahon homestead is round a bend a
short distance up stream, it is necessary to cross the Cox twice,
or to follow the bend round to get to it; but before doing either,
make inquiry at the farm-house on the right just before reaching
the river.</p>
<p class="center">Second Day.</p>
<p>McMahon's to Pippin's accommodation house, Burragorang, distance
15 miles. An easy day, and an early start is not necessary. The
highway crosses and recrosses Cox's River several times in a few
miles. This gets monotonous and can be avoided by taking the bridle
track, on west side, used in times of flood. With ordinary care no
difficulty will arise, and the main road is rejoined just below the
junction of Cox and Wollondilly. A dip in the Wollondilly at
Fitzpatrick's Crossing will be appreciated while the billy is being
boiled for lunch. Pippin's accommodation house should be reached by
5 p.m. Shortly after crossing Wollondilly bridge, and about 2 miles
from Pippin's is a weathered sandstone boulder containing a curious
specimen of aboriginal art, known locally as the "red hands." Do
not miss it. Mr. McMahon will direct more fully. If time be
limited, accommodation can be obtained at Dunn's first night,
instead of at McMahon's and the Oaks reached on the evening of the
second day.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-31.jpg"><br>
(Weeping Rock, Wentworth Falls)</p>
<p class="center">Third Day.</p>
<p>Burragorang to Picton: distance, 22 or 23 miles. Make an early
start, though the new road up the mountain is an easy grade. If the
destination be Camden, keep right on to The Oaks; if Picton, turn
to the right opposite the public school by the road side. If Monday
be a holiday, there is usually a late train to Sydney. If
otherwise, you must stay at Picton until next morning, in which
case expenses will be increased to that extent. This is an ideal
walk&mdash;out of the beaten tourist routes. For a considerable
part it is bush-track, and quite unsuitable for vehicular traffic.
Until the confluence of Cox, Wollondilly, and Warragamba is passed
the only travellers likely to be encountered are horsemen. Rugged
mountain scenery is varied by fertile agricultural lands limited in
area, and the view from Wentworth Falls end overlooking Cox's River
and Burragorang Valley is probably unsurpassed on the whole
mountain range. The view from the Jumpback is very fine, and is
familiar to many who make the trip from The Oaks, but it is not so
stupendous as the view from the other end. (See "Notes from Diary,"
Part III.)</p>
<p><a name="ch-2-6-2" id="ch-2-6-2"></a><b>*No. 2.&mdash;Bell to
Richmond, <i>viâ</i> Mount Wilson, Mount Irvine, and Kurrajong
Heights.</b></p>
<p>Distance, 45 miles.</p>
<p>Estimated cost as low as 17s. Thus: 2nd class return to Bell,
6s. 10d.; accommodation <i>en route</i>, 10s. 2d.=17s. 1st class,
13s 8d.; accommodation <i>en route</i>, 10s 2d.= 23s. 10d. The
return from Bell is available for return from Richmond.</p>
<p class="center">First Day</p>
<p>Saturday is the best day to commence this jaunt taking the 7.52
a.m. at Sydney, which reaches Bell at about 11.56 a.m. As there is
neither hotel nor boarding-house at Mount Wilson, it is necessary
to carry a sleeping bag for the first night, after which it could
be sent back to Bell by mail coach, if so desired. Water is
obtainable at the deserted school premises, and camp might be
pitched in the vicinity. Mount Wilson is a very beautiful and
fertile plateau of limited extent, and like its
neighbours&mdash;Mounts Hay and Tomah&mdash;is of volcanic origin.
The scientific opinion is that here during the earlier Tertiary,
three or four points of volcanic eruption were in activity. "A
great volcano poured out its sheets of lava, remnants of which
remain on Mounts Hay, King George, Tomah, and Wilson." Mount Wilson
is taken up almost entirely with more or less pretentious summer
residences, which are given over to the charge of caretakers for
two-thirds of the year.</p>
<p>Provision is necessary for three or four meals <i>en route</i>.
As there is no accommodation of any kind at Bell, boil the billy
immediately on arrival, and have lunch. Between Bell and Mount
Wilson the road has been formed, and, in dry weather, is fairly
good with sandy patches. In common with most mountain tracks, it
keeps pretty near the arid top of the spur; to the right fine
glimpses into the Govett's Leap valley are obtainable. But at the
foot of Mount Wilson a fertile region is reached. As you ascend the
pretty zigzag track rich loam, good timber, and tree-fern are
already in evidence, and, consequent upon a State concession to the
original landowners, the road from the 9-mile post becomes a
beautiful avenue of limes and chestnuts. English trees and shrubs
have been freely planted, and do well here. At "Yarrawa" is a fine
hawthorn hedge, and a very healthy specimen of holly crimson with
berries looked well at the time of my first visit. Apples do well,
but the altitude is too great for most other fruits. As might be
expected in this favoured spot, all homesteads have extensive
gardens, and in one or two instances the improvements are of an
expensive character. At "Yarrawa," is a Turkish bath, alleged to
have cost the late Mr. Wynne £2,000 to construct; commodious
stables are furnished with a number of loose-boxes, and water is
laid on throughout the establishment.</p>
<p class="center">Second Day.</p>
<p>Away early, breakfast and lunch on track. Mount Irvine, 7 or 8
miles distant, is several hundred feet lower than Mount Wilson, the
character of the country is the same, but is occupied mostly by
selectors. The track for the most part may be described as a
beautiful avenue in which tree-ferns, healthy and luxuriant,
outnumber everything else&mdash;even white woods and gums. Care
must be taken, as the turn-off for Tomah-road is very
indistinct&mdash;the merest bridle track. It leaves the cleared
road on the right-hand side at a point about 7 miles from Mount
Wilson, and about 100 yards past the sawmill. Should the mill be
deserted and you overrun the turn-off, the folks at the farmhouse,
half a mile further on, will put you right. But assuming that you
pick it up: at the outset the track is not very distinct, and it is
important to remember that its trend <i>is to the left</i>: there
is a more beaten track bearing away <i>to the right</i>; this is
merely a bullock trail, and must be rejected. The bridle-track
takes you across the gorge, through which runs a clear cold stream,
easily forded. At the top of the mountain, Tomah side of the gorge,
you pick up a formed, but little used, road, which connects with
Mount Tomah-Richmond road at the 20 mile post. It is 10 miles from
this point to Mrs. Peck's accommodation house, Kurrajong Heights.
Arrived at the foot of Kurrajong Mountain, turn to the right,
taking the old road, and at the top of the mountain turn again to
the right along the ridge. This will bring you to the back of Mrs.
Peck's, and will save the descent and subsequent long, tiresome
climb up to the front of the house. I have also stayed at Mrs.
Richards' "Belmore House," which occupies a very convenient
position on the main road opposite the Post Office. Total distance
for the day, about 25 miles. Should there be ladies in the party,
or from any other cause the distance be considered too great,
accommodation is available at Mr. Graham's near the 22-mile post.
In which case, on reaching Tomah-Richmond road turn to your right
and go towards Mount Tomah for 2 miles, or accommodation may be
obtained at Norwood, about 7 miles from Kurrajong Heights.</p>
<p class="center">Third Day.</p>
<p>If at Peck's, the interval before breakfast can be enjoyably
filled in with a pair of field glasses, if you carry
them&mdash;there is an ancient telescope at the house&mdash;or
sampling oranges if in season. Magnificent views may be obtained;
at night the reflection of the lights of Sydney is plainly visible,
and if the morning be clear, there is a glorious panorama.
Castlereagh and Penrith to the right, Richmond and Hawkesbury
Agricultural College at foot, and the dim suggestion of the mother
city of Australia away on the skyline.</p>
<p>Twelve miles only remain to be accomplished, and you can easily
cast the distance behind you, and lunch in Richmond, or at the
hotel&mdash;the "Traveller's Rest"&mdash;just before crossing the
river. Better still; you may boil billy on the river bank and lunch
in the open as hitherto. The Grose Valley road is much the
prettier. From it you obtain a peep into the stupendous gap in the
mountain range through which the waters of the Grose rush to join
the Hawkesbury. As far as the eye can reach orange-culture is the
staple industry. If the trip be made in July or August you will
pass through square miles of well-kept orchards yellow with the
season's fruit. The magnificent Monier arch bridge lately thrown
across the Hawkesbury is worthy more than passing notice. Train
leaves Richmond at 4.15 p.m. If not limited to three days, a day
can be spent very pleasantly on the Grose River. A boat is
obtainable at Mr. Burcher's farm at the junction, and you can pull
right up to the gap.</p>
<p><a name="ch-2-6-3" id="ch-2-6-3"></a><b>No. 3.&mdash;Moss Vale
to Kiama, <i>viâ</i> Fitzroy Falls, Kangaroo Valley, Berry and
Gerringong.</b></p>
<p>Distance, about 52 miles.</p>
<p>Estimated cost as low as 22s. 8d. Thus: Moss Vale-Nowra
tourists' return, 2nd class, 7s. 8d.; accommodation <i>en
route</i>, 15s.=22s. 8d. 1st class, 15s. 4d.; accommodation <i>en
route</i>, 15s.=30s. 4d.</p>
<p class="center">First Day</p>
<p>The 5.15 p.m. from Sydney on Friday is a suitable train. Either
boarding-house or hotel accommodation is easily obtainable near to
the railway station at Moss Vale. Material sufficient for three or
four meals is required. If a very early start be made, and it is
preferred, breakfast may be had at one of the accommodation houses
at Yarrunga, three-quarters of a mile from Fitzroy Falls, at 8.30
or 9 o'clock. But having the means at your disposal, you can light
a fire at any suitable place, and draw upon your own stock. Even if
you have visited Fitzroy previously, the day will be yet young when
you arrive, and an hour or so can be spared to renew acquaintance
with one of the finest waterfalls in the State. Should the weather
be hot, a very refreshing dip may be indulged in about a quarter of
a mile up-stream. Trout and other fish may be caught here, but
there will not be time for fishing. Good water may be procured
about luncheon time on the descent of Barrengarry Mountain; and,
without making the pace, the pretty suspension bridge, some
three-quarters of a mile from Kangaroo Valley, should be crossed by
4.30 p.m. By turning to the left, up-stream, two or three hundred
yards, a dip and rest may be had. You have choice of two hotels in
the village, and the charges are reasonable. Distance for the day,
22 miles.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-32.jpg"><br>
(Suspension Bridge, Kangaroo Valley)</p>
<p class="center">Second Day.</p>
<p>Away at daybreak&mdash;breakfast and lunch <i>en route</i>. The
climb up the mountain is very stiff, but it is a shade easier than
Cambewarra. All the way up the views are splendid, and some very
pretty bits of road are met with. If the day be clear the view from
the top of the mountain, of the Shoalhaven country, is magnificent.
You should pass through Berry before noon, and reach Gerringong
about 4 p.m., having lunched by the way. The distance dividing
Berry and Gerringong is 9 miles, and if the trip is made in a good
season, you will be surprised to recognise how much of the
picturesque is missed by tourists whose acquaintance with this
portion of the South Coast is limited to the view from the window
of the railway carriage. At Gerringong are two hotels&mdash;one
near the railway station, and the other in the township. Distance
for the day, about 23 miles.</p>
<p class="center">Third Day.</p>
<p>This is an easy day&mdash;only 7 miles "to go," You may have a
good rest, and breakfast at the hotel. Only 7 miles! But not one is
dull or uninteresting, the road winding round the sides of the
hills with the ocean always in view. Visit the "Blow Hole," and
other places of interest, lunch, and catch the 2.29 train, reaching
Sydney about 6.5 p.m.</p>
<p><a name="ch-2-6-4" id="ch-2-6-4"></a><b>No. 4.&mdash;Moss Vale

<p class="center">First Day</p>
<p>This is claimed by a companion of the road to be the "picture"
trip of the tableland and South Coast, embracing as it does Fitzroy
and Belmore Falls, the best of their kind in the State; Macquarie
Pass, which is a formidable rival of the famous Bulli Pass; and
pretty arcadian Jamberoo. Provision for three or four meals should
be made. If you do not wish to spend any time at Fitzroy leave
Sydney for Moss Vale by the 8 o'clock on Saturday morning. On
arrival at Moss Vale lunch on the track, and make Yarrunga for tea.
A post card, sent a couple of days ahead, mentioning probable hour
of arrival, and strength of the party, will be appreciated. If,
however, you with to rest and thoroughly see Fitzroy, you should
leave Sydney by the 5.15 p.m. Friday, stay the night at Moss Vale,
and get to Yarrunga for breakfast or lunch Saturday, according to
inclination. If not in good walking condition, this would be much
the better plan.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-33.jpg"><br>
(Cathedral Rocks, Kiama)</p>
<p class="center">Second Day.</p>
<p>Start early if you prefer it, but as you have only 15 miles in
front of you there is really no need to do so. Breakfast at
Yarrunga, lunch at Belmore Falls; tea and sleep at Robertson. A
very pretty walk for the most part. Good easy road, except the long
rise near Robertson. Beautiful agricultural land occurs between
Fitzroy and Belmore Falls: the latter falls are very fine,
especially on the descent to the cataracts. The "Look-out" commands
a glorious view over Kangaroo Valley, and Cambewarra. As you
approach Robertson some idea is gained of the pest blackberry vines
may become if permitted to run wild. Acres of rich land are
overrun, and the local story is that they can neither be burnt,
ploughed, nor dug out. Robertson is only a small place, but has two
hotels. An effort should be made to arrive early enough to visit
the unique and pretty Robertson Park, situated within ten minutes'
walk of the centre of the village.</p>
<p class="center">Third Day.</p>
<p>Away at daybreak, as there is a long walk&mdash;30
miles&mdash;in front of you. Breakfast and lunch on the track; or,
if preferred, lunch can be had at one of the hotels at Albion Park,
which township you reach about midday. It is 6 or 7 miles to
Jamberoo, and 5 or 6 miles thence to Kiama, and it is possible to
reach Kiama for tea; but if the walk is taken leisurely, a stay may
be made at Jamberoo for tea, and Kiama reached afterwards. Should
any member of the party become tender-footed, a contingency which
sometimes happens, the walk might terminate at Albion Park. On the
other hand, if not absolutely limited to three days, you could stay
the night at Jamberoo, make Kiama for lunch or breakfast next day,
and take the 2.20 p.m. to Sydney.</p>
<p>On Mondays there is a train at 5.30 a.m., timed to reach Sydney
at 8.55 a.m. Other days, Sundays excepted, the 7.55 o'clock is the
earliest; this is timed to reach Sydney at 11.20 a.m.</p>

<p class="center">First Day</p>
<p>This is an excellent trip, taking in the two Falls, the great
view of the Shoalhaven Valley from Kangaroo Mountain, and the
Look-out at Belmore. It has the defect, however, of being a track
which doubles on itself for several miles, from Belmore Falls <i>en
route</i> to Kangaroo Valley. Supplies for four meals are required.
The 8 o'clock Saturday morning to Moss Vale is a suitable train.
Lunch on the track, and tea and sleep at Yarrunga&mdash;distance, a
shade over 10 miles.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-34.jpg"><br>
(Head of Fitzroy Falls)</p>
<p class="center">Second Day.</p>
<p>Away at daybreak&mdash;27 miles to accomplish before tea.
Breakfast at the creek which crosses the road about 3 miles from
Belmore Falls. You will be the best judge of your walking
condition, and consequently of the time you can afford to spend at
the falls. But, if you do not care to engage in the additional
labour of descending to the valley and climbing back, do not miss
the Look-out, from which point a splendid view of Kangaroo Valley
is obtained. A splash in one of the several fine holes in the creek
before resuming your journey will refresh you, and add some spring
to your step. Lunch when convenient, and reach Kangaroo Valley for
tea. A short distance before rejoining the Moss Vale-Nowra road you
pass the turn-off to the Lady Manning Look-out. You can afford to
let this go, as it is very little different from the view at
Belmore Falls Look-out, and will add at least 3 miles to the
already solid day's journey. As mentioned elsewhere, there are two
hotels at Kangaroo Valley&mdash;they stand opposite one another,
and either will supply accommodation at a reasonable charge.</p>
<p class="center">Third Day.</p>
<p>Start as soon as it is light&mdash;18 miles to cast behind
before lunch. Take the road up Cambewarra Mountain, <i>as if you
were going to Nowra</i>. This is important&mdash;do not turn off to
Berry. When you reach the top of the mountain turn to the left,
leaving Nowra-road. This will bring you out presently on the top of
the ridge, from whence, if the day be clear, there is a good view
of the Shoalhaven, Jervis Bay, and the coast-line&mdash;the
magnitude and magnificence of which will speedily erase any
recollection of inconvenience experienced in toiling up Cambewarra.
Many consider this the view <i>par excellence</i> of the South
Coast. Four or five miles will bring you out on to the Kangaroo
Valley-Berry-road. You can reach Berry, comfortably, for lunch, and
catch the 1.58 p.m. for Sydney; failing which you must wait for the
4.32 p.m.&mdash;the famous, or is it infamous, milk train. The
former is timed to reach Sydney at 6.5 p.m., the latter arrives as
soon after 11 p.m. as it may.</p>
<p><a name="ch-2-6-6" id="ch-2-6-6"></a><b>*No. 6.&mdash;Bell to
Richmond, <i>viâ</i> Bell's Line, Mount Tomah, and Kurrajong
Heights.</b></p>
<p>Distance, about 42 miles.</p>
<p>Estimated cost as low as 15s. Thus: 2nd class return to Bell,
6s. 10d. (available for return from Richmond); accommodation <i>en
route</i>, 8s. 2d.=15s. 1st class, 13s. 8d.; accommodation <i>en
route</i>, 8s. 2d.=21s. 10d.)</p>
<p>Provision is required for four or five meals. There is need for
a sleeping-bag and mosquito-net, as you must camp out the first
night; practically no accommodation being available at Bell.
Indeed, as you have the "plant" with you, if the weather be
propitious, you might prefer to camp out the second night also; in
which case the foot of Kurrajong Mountain is suggested as a
suitable spot. Between Bell and Kurrajong Heights accommodation is
available at Mr Graham's, near the 22-mile post, on the Tomah-road.
This would cut the trip into shorter lengths, but would add a day
to the time required.</p>
<p>The 7.52 a.m. on Saturday reaches Bell about midday, and having
had an unusually early breakfast, you will be ready for lunch
immediately on arrival. Water may be got at the station, and the
billy boiled right away. Follow the Mount Wilson road for some
distance, taking the right-hand track along the ridge at a point
some 5 miles from Bell&mdash;there is an ancient finger-board, but
the legend "To Richmond" is not very distinct. On this historic
"Bell's Line," in days that are gone, stock crossed the Blue
Mountains. If you have had any experience of travelling stock, if
you have seen thirsty cattle string out as they approached water,
or heard a frenzied mob stampede in the middle of the dark
night&mdash;this narrow, arid, but occasionally picturesque track
will not be destitute of interest. During the afternoon you should
cut out 10 or 12 miles. It will be better not to walk too late, as
you have the camp to fix up, and the enjoyment of the next day's
walk depends a great deal on whether you secure a comfortable
sleep. There is a hill with big sandstone boulders which, if there
is time to reach it, should make an excellent dry camping
place.</p>
<p class="center">Second Day.</p>
<p>Approaching Mount Tomah a formed road is met with; the country
becomes much more picturesque, and with a decent pair of Zeiss
field-glasses you will get a view of great beauty and extent from
the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>Like Mounts Wilson and Hay, Tomah is basaltic: this is readily
recognised from the greatly improved character of the country; and
the track from this point to the foot of Kurrajong Mountain is a
gentle grade, and a cyclist could free-wheel the entire distance.
If you decide not to camp out again, take the old road&mdash;turn
to the right&mdash;up the mountain, and when the summit is reached
turn again to the right, and follow the crest of the mountain round
to the <i>back</i> of Mrs. Peck's accommodation house. This is
important to recollect, and will save much time, temper, and a
wearisome and unnecessary climb. Accommodation may be obtained also
at Mrs. Richards', Belmore House, opposite the post office.</p>
<p class="center">Third Day.</p>
<p>Only 12 miles to complete the tour and, therefore, no need to
start until after breakfast. (For this day's programme refer to

<p>Bowral to Robertson 15 miles only. An early start is desirable,
though by no means necessary. Breakfast and lunch on the track. The
country is undulating and fertile, and there is not an
uninteresting mile. The view from the heights, near West Kangaloon,
is very fine. Matters may be taken very leisurely, and a rest of a
couple of hours at midday may be indulged in.</p>

finger-post some 3 miles out of Robertson. There is an alternative
route: proceed as though going to Macquarie Pass, and turn to the
right at the finger-post marked "Fountaindale." This will bring you
round to the other road in time, but this road is not recommended
except as a variation if you have "done" the other track. Shortly
after you begin the descent of the mountain you will be confronted
by a dividing of ways, and no finger-post to guide you. Take the
right-hand track, although the smaller. The other will bring you
out all right, but the right-hand one is recommended. It is very
narrow&mdash;a bridle track in fact&mdash;and the grade is such
that you go down a long way in a short time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-35.jpg"><br>
(A Refreshing Interlude&mdash;Crossing Broger's Creek)</p>
<p>Presently you come in sight of a farm-house, and a track bearing
away to the left towards the house; it is immaterial which track is
taken, as they connect about a mile further on. You are now in
sight of the Kangaroo river, the course of which is followed for
several miles. This is a walk fit for the gods. Mountains range on
both sides, you proceed by a pretty and unfrequented track, where
the aggressive chuf-chuf will not violate the graces for at least
100 years; and with the music of the river in your ears Kangaroo
Valley should be reached before nightfall. If you can arrange for
accommodation at Wattamolla it is competent to cut out the journey
to the township of Kangaroo Valley. If you do this, cross the river
just after passing Mr. Tate's homestead, and turn to the right at
the public school, which track will bring you to Broger's Creek.
Follow this till within ¼ mile of the first homestead, then cross
Broger's Creek to the Woodhill-Berry road. This is the highway to
Wattamolla. As there is neither hotel nor boarding-house at
Wattamolla, arrangement as to accommodation must be made
beforehand. By the intervention of a friend, the writer and Mr.
Hamlet were handsomely entertained at the comfortable home of Mr.
W. Brandon, but such accommodation, though on this occasion
heartily extended, might not always be available&mdash;hence the
need for careful inquiry in advance.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Tuesday.</b></p>
<p>Whether you stop at Kangaroo Valley or Wattamolla, an early
start is desirable, and in the former case it is absolutely
necessary, as there is a good stiff day's walk in front of you. If
you start from Kangaroo Valley take the Berry-road, turning to the
left after passing the cemetery, and subsequently, turn again to
the left, taking the Woodhill-Berry road; finger-posts will direct
you. Most of the way up the mountain you have Broger's Creek in
view, and the scene is one of great beauty. Turn short round to the
left at the Council Chambers, at Woodhill, and rejecting all
further left-hand turnings, go straight up the mountain. For some
distance up the mountain the road is plain and cleared; later on it
becomes less plainly marked, and on the mountain top is merely a
cattle trail. Nevertheless with care you should experience no
difficulty. Bear in mind that though your course may sometimes, in
skirting a gully, bear away to the left, <i>the general trend is to
the right</i>. Particularly reject the left-hand track at the top
of the mountain, as it will take you to Robertson. The mountain top
is a sandy plateau, a bit marshy in parts after rain, but the
views, especially as you pass along the range above the Fox-ground,
are magnificent. Finally you reach a gate which gives access to a
most beautiful pathway leading to the centre of Saddleback. This
is, perhaps, the principal of the Kiama picnic grounds. If the day
be clear a view is obtainable from this spot, which i probably the
finest of all the South Coast views. For extent, the view from the
pinnacle, Mount Wellington, Hobart, is the only one in the writer's
experience which approaches it. Consider for a moment. The ridge
you are standing on is quite narrow; looking south over a ravishing
vista of shade and colour the eye easily reaches Jervis Bay; to the
north you look clear away to Botany Heads, and, with the assistance
of glasses, Sydney can be made out. You may then stroll leisurely
down the remaining 4 or 5 miles into Kiama in time for tea, prior
to entraining for Sydney.</p>
<p>In respect of the view from Saddleback, I cull the following
from notes furnished by Dr. Cullen, Chief Justice, to the editor of
the Handbook published by the Australasian Association, Sydney,
1898:&mdash;"Those who care for a bit of mountain climbing on
horseback can get one of the finest views in New South Wales by
taking the road to the left just before you reach Pike's Hill, on
the way from Kiama to Jamberoo. This leads through some pretty
country at Longbrush; thence to the Saddleback ridge, along which
Hoddle's track leads westward to the highlands, connecting
ultimately with the Robertson to Moss Vale road. A mile or two
along Hoddle's track carries you over the highest point of the
Saddleback, but the best view is gained farther on where the road
descends to a narrow grassy ridge. Here the eye carries to Jervis
Bay on the South, and to Port Hacking on the north, over a
continuous series of hills and hollows, of green farms and tumbling
streams, while by sea the various little seaport towns of the
Illawarra are clearly visible. One can return <i>viâ</i> the
Brandon Hill road, the approach to which is gained through
slip-rails known to residents in the neighbourhood, though not
perhaps too easily found by a stranger." (See also <a href=

<p>A most suitable Easter trip; fairly easy going, with no big

2nd day&mdash;Clarence Town to Dungog   15 miles
3rd day&mdash;Dungog to Paterson        23 miles

Total                              72 miles
</pre>
<p>You should reach East Maitland Thursday night, ready to take the
track on the morrow (Good Friday).</p>
<p>Start at daybreak&mdash;breakfast and lunch on the track, tea
and sleep at Clarence Town. The initial miles are through Morpeth,
Hinton, and part of the Hunter Valley, crossing <i>en route</i> the
Hunter and Paterson. About midday you pass Seaham, and for a short
distance follow the course of the Williams. The river is here very
wide, and little steamers ply merrily picking up milk-cans from the
several wharves. Clarence Town is the head of navigation, and is
reached towards evening. It is only a small township, but there
will be no difficulty in securing accommodation at moderate
charges.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Second Day.</b></p>
<p>Breakfast and lunch on the track. As it is an easy day&mdash;15
miles only&mdash;a few hours respite may be indulged in at midday.
By this time you will be near to the Williams, which may be reached
by crossing a paddock. There are good holes for a dip, and,
altogether, it is a most suitable spot for a few hours' rest.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-36.jpg"><br>
(Macleay River, Near Kempsey)</p>
<p>There is very little evidence of cultivation; the country being
mostly in occupation by dairy farmers. If it be your first visit to
these parts, the rather smartly-built township of Dungog is
somewhat of a surprise. It breaks into view all at once, being
hidden by the hills until you get quite near to it.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Third Day.</b></p>
<p>An early start as usual&mdash;breakfast and lunch on the track.
For the first few miles shape your course as if returning to
Clarence town, then bear away to the right. Passing through the
hamlet of Wallarobba, climb the mountain of that name, but the
ascent is only a small matter. The descent is by a rather pretty
zigzag. Very shortly you pass a few houses, and, a couple of miles
further on, if you bear away to the right from the main road, and
follow the travelling stock route, it will shorten your journey,
and you can make the Paterson river in nice time for lunch. This is
called the Upper Paterson; it consists of rich river flats. A rest
and dip may be enjoyed, and Paterson township reached in good time
for tea.</p>

(A Creek on the Brunswick, North Coast.)</p>
<p align="center"><b>Fourth Day.</b></p>
<p>An early start is scarcely necessary, as but 12 miles will
complete your tour. Do not cross the bridge, but, keeping the river
on the left, proceed by way of Tocal. From the heights, if the
morning be clear, a glorious view is obtainable of the fertile
lucerne flats of the Hunter Valley. Lunch at West Maitland, and
catch the afternoon train for Sydney. If the season be not too dry,
this will be found a very pretty trip, embracing agricultural,
dairy, and forest country; added to which are the fine views of the
Hunter, Paterson, and Williams Rivers. Provision should be made for
five or six meals, but you can replenish the stock at Clarence Town
or Dungog if necessary. (See also <a href="#ch-3-5">"Notes from

<h3><a name="ch-2-8" id="ch-2-8"></a>FIVE-DAY TRIP.</h3>
<p><a name="ch-2-8-1" id="ch-2-8-1"></a><b>*Mittagong to Mittagong,
<i>viâ</i> Wollondilly River, Wombeyan Caves, Taralga, Goulburn,
Moss Vale and Berrima.</b></p>
<p>Distance to walk, 80 or 95 miles (according to inclination).</p>
<p>Estimated cost as low as 45s. Thus: Railway fares, 11s. 1d.
(Mittagong, 2nd class return, 6s. 6d.: Goulburn to Moss Vale,
single, 2nd class, 4s. 7d.); accommodation and other charges at
Caves for two nights and one day, 13s.; expenses <i>en route</i>,
11s. 6d.; coach Taralga to Goulburn, 7s. 6d. The last item is, of
course, at discretion.</p>
<p>This trip provides much variety, both in mode of travelling and
in scenery. In respect of the former there is the train, coach, and
walking; and of the latter, open sheep country, rugged and
precipitous mountain ranges, beautiful river, brilliant caveland,
agricultural and forest lands.</p>
<p>In the first place a note should be addressed to "Mr Goodfellow,
near Bullio station, Wombeyan-road, Mittagong," stating the
strength of the party and making inquiry as to whether he can
afford accommodation. If he cannot, there is no accommodation to be
depended on between Mittagong and Wombeyan, and you must make
preparation to camp out, by carrying a rug or
sleeping-bag&mdash;latter preferred. Accommodation of a sort has
been got at Bullio Station, but it has also been refused; and in
order to avoid disappointment it is better to make the provision
indicated. However, this point having been satisfactorily settled,
the 5.15 p.m. on Friday will land you at Mittagong at a few minutes
to 8 o'clock. Having got a definite notion of the road overnight,
an early start should be made&mdash;breakfast and lunch on the
track. A stimulating draught may be had as you pass the famous
Chalybeate spring, about a mile out of Mittagong. The journey may
be considerably shortened by following the Joadja railway line
until it intersects with the Bowral-Wombeyan road. Mr Goodfellow's
home is about 2 miles past the tunnel, or some 18 miles from
Mittagong. If the reply from that gentleman has not been
favourable, continue for a few miles, and pitch your camp between
Bullio station and the Wollondilly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-38.jpg"><br>
(Carlotta Arch, Jenolan Caves.)</p>
<p align="center"><b>Second Day.</b></p>
<p>An early start as usual. You have in front of you a most
attractive walk. A splendid road winds down the mountain side,
giving here and there magnificent glimpses of the fine reaches of
the Wollondilly&mdash;which has here cut out for itself a great
channel&mdash;and then follows the inexorable 7½ miles climb, along
the road hemmed in by great mountains, which frown on you from
every side, their topmost peaks being mostly enveloped in mist. But
what surprises the man from the plains most is to find precipitous
and apparently barren mountains stocked. Nor is this all; they are
to some considerable extent cup up into paddocks. Decent grass-land
is scarce where this sort of country is pressed into service, and
what a picnic it must be to muster. From the top of the mountain to
the caretaker's house at Wombeyan the distance is about three (3)
miles, and you should arrive in excellent trim for your tea.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Third Day</b></p>
<p>will be very pleasantly spent in resting and in visiting the
caves under the efficient and cheerful guidance of Mr. Chalker. You
will not regret the visit to Wombeyan, even though you are familiar
with Jenolan and Yarrangobilly. For "as one star differs from
another in glory," so Wombeyan has its show pieces&mdash;its
wonderful shawls, its glacier basin, and other unique formations,
and while like, it is yet different from the others. If you desire
some native thing to recall your visit, perhaps, Mr. Chalker may
know where some specimens of calcite and breccia are
obtainable.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Fourth Day.</b></p>
<p>Arrange for an early breakfast, or, better still, climb the
mountain and boil the billy on top. The road follows the mountain
chain for some miles, and there is very little to attract attention
until you approach Taralga, where you get into the home of the
potato. Having reached Taralga in time for lunch, you are in a
position to choose whether you will continue to Goulburn on foot or
take the coach, at a cost of 7s. 6d. The coach leaves at 3.30p.m.,
and is to be preferred. The 30 miles from Taralga to Goulburn is
not tourist country: mostly of the kind denominated "hungry," it
presents few, if any, attractions to the pedestrian. If you take
the coach you reach Goulburn about 9 p.m., and, getting to rest
early, you may catch the express in the morning and breakfast at
Moss Vale.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Fifth Day.</b></p>
<p>The circuit is completed by walking from Moss Vale to Mittagong,
<i>viâ</i> the quaint and historic old township of Berrima, upon
the walls of which the legend "Ichabod" is writ in letters
sufficiently large. It is a delightful walk and will form an
appropriate termination to the tour. The distance is only 15 miles;
lunch <i>en route</i>, and, reaching Mittagong for tea, catch the
6.5 a.m. train to Sydney next day.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-39.jpg"><br>
(The Throne, Kooringa Cave, Wombeyan Caves.)</p>
<p><i>Note.</i> If only four days are at your disposal the trip
might end at Goulburn on the evening of the fourth day, and the
return to Sydney be made by the morning express. In this case the
cost of the trip will work out a few shillings less than the
estimate&mdash;perhaps 40s. Some might have scruples about coaching
from Taralga to Goulburn. "Not their notion of a walking trip. Why,
when Buggins goes on a walking tour, he plays it right up to the
handle: camps anywhere&mdash;in caves if it is wet&mdash;cadges
tucker, shakes fruit, and pretends to look for work." Which is
largely a question of taste or temperament. If this be so, the walk
from Taralga to Goulburn would cut out the five days, and the
Berrima trip, though very much more interesting, would have to be
dispensed with. All this, however, is detail.</p>
<p>Food will be required for seven or eight meals. (See also

Mountain returning&mdash;</b></p>
<p><b>(1) Via Hampton and Mount Victoria.<br>
(2) Via Oberon and Tarana.</b></p>
<p>Distance in either case, about 70 miles.</p>
<p>Estimated cost as low as (1) 48s. 4d.; (2) 54s. 1d. Thus; (1)
2nd class return to Mount Victoria, 6s. 4d (1st, 12s. 8d.);
accommodation and charges at the Caves for two days, say, 28s.;
expenses <i>en route</i>, 14s.=48s. 4d. (2) Train fares,
approximately, 10s. 2d. 2nd return, Eskbank, 7s. 10d. (1st, 15s.
8d.); 2nd single, Tarana to Eskbank, 2s. 4d. (1st, 3s. 11d.);
accommodation and charges at the Caves for two days, say 28s.;
expenses <i>en route</i>, 12s.=54s. 1d.</p>
<p>Provision is necessary for seven or eight meals. Take a
sleeping-bag. On either route the starting point is Katoomba. The
7.52 a.m. from Sydney on Saturday or Wednesday will land you at
Katoomba at 10.52 a.m. Get under way at once; lunch at Nellie's
Glen; and camp that night at the Cox's River crossing, about 10
miles from Katoomba. You may find the track somewhat indistinct at
one point in Megalong Valley, but if you recollect that Megalong
Creek is always on the right, and that <i>you do not cross it</i>,
you will presently come out on a formed road that will carry you to
the end of the day's journey at Cox's River crossing. It is just
possible that shelter may be obtained here at the hut to the left,
down the river, should the weather turn out wet. A number of
finger-posts have recently been placed along this route by the
Tourist Bureau to assist pedestrians.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Second Day.</b></p>
<p>Make an early start, climb Megalong Mountain, and breakfast at
Little River. A dip while the billy is being boiled will assist you
to climb the Black Mountain. The track along the spur is easy
walking, but not at all interesting. Lunch at any convenient spot,
and reach the Caves House for tea. The last few miles is an easy
down grade, and the views are grand.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-41.jpg"><br>
(The Road near the Caves.)</p>
<p>The <i>old</i> road, which turns off at the 5-mile post and
brings you in at the Devil's Coachhouse and at the back of the
Carlotta Arch, is preferred by some: it is much shorter than the
new road.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Third and Fourth Day.</b></p>
<p>During these two days your programme will be made for you. You
will make two or three inspections each day. Ten shillings (10s.)
per day is the charge for accommodation at Caves House. Inspection
fees: 2s. each, daily inspection; 3s. night and Sunday: season
ticket, covering five inspections, 7s. 6d.</p>
<p align="center"><b>RETURN JOURNEY.</b></p>
<p>Before purchasing your train ticket decide as to the return
route. If by Mount Victoria, the cost is 1st class week-end 12s.
8d., 2nd 6s. 4d. The alternate route&mdash;for a six-day
trip&mdash;via Oberon and Tarana is recommended without hesitation.
In this case take Eskbank return&mdash;week-end 1st, 15s. 8d.; 2nd,
7s. 10d.&mdash;Eskbank being the limit of the week-end excursion
fares. On arrival at Tarana you would only require a single for the
excess distance&mdash;Tarana to Eskbank. The approximate cost of
which would be 1st class, 3s. 11d.; 2nd class, 2s. During summer
the cheap tickets are issued to Tarana.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Fifth and Sixth Days.</b></p>
<p>If returning by Oberon and Tarana, breakfast and lunch on the
track, and stay the first night at Oberon, distance about 18 miles;
and repeating the programme, reach Tarana on the evening of the
second (or sixth) day. Distance again about 18 miles. Here you pick
up the mail at 11.52 p.m., and reach Sydney at a few minutes to 6
o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-42.jpg"><br>
(Crystal PalaceJenolan Caves.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you decide to return by Mount Victoria,
you reach Hampton&mdash;halfway&mdash;the first day, and Mount
Victoria on the evening of the second (or sixth) day, and taking
the 2.34 a.m. reach Sydney at 5 minutes to 9. (See also <a href=

<p>Distance, about 156 miles.</p>
<p>Estimated cost as low as 55s 10d. Thus: 2nd week-end return to
Bell, 6s. 10d (1st, 13s. 8d.); accommodation, &amp;c., Jenolan, one
day, 14s.; accommodation, &amp;c., Wombeyan, one day, 10s.;
expenses <i>en route</i>, 25s.= 55s. 10d.</p>
<p align="center"><b>First and Second Days</b></p>
<p>Provision for fifteen or sixteen meals should be made; do not
stock to this extent at Sydney, as supplies are obtainable at
Whalan's 2½ miles from the Caves, and elsewhere <i>en route</i>.
You must also have your sleeping-bag and mosquito-net, as there is
little or no accommodation available between Jenolan and Wombeyan.
Mittagong, Bowral, and Bell are distant from Sydney 78, 81, and 82
miles respectively; hence if you take a week-end return to
Bell&mdash;6s. 10d.&mdash;it is available for return from either
Mittagong or Bowral. You may leave Sydney on Friday evening, so as
to be in readiness to take the track from Katoomba early Saturday
morning; but this does not materially assist you. Katoomba to
Jenolan&mdash;32 to 34 miles&mdash;should at most only occupy a
day-and-a-half. Therefore, if you take the 7.52 a.m. on Saturday,
you get under way from Katoomba at 11 o'clock, and can easily cut
out the 10 miles to Cox's River crossing by nightfall, and arrive
at Jenolan for tea next evening.</p>

(Crossing the Dividing Range Near Jenolan Caves, in a
Snowstorm.)</p>
<p align="center"><b>Third Day</b></p>
<p>will be spent at Jenolan Caves. There will be two daylight
inspections, and, if desired, a night inspection. Accommodation at
the Caves should be secured before leaving Sydney&mdash;the charge
is 10s. per day.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Fourth Day</b></p>
<p>An early start should be made so that the long steep ascent of
the mountain may be in the freshness of the morning. Later you
leave the Oberon-road, turning to the left for Ginkin (9 miles),
and passing Shooters' Hill (17 miles) during the afternoon, pitch
your camp at any suitable place.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Days.</b></p>
<p>During the next three days you enjoy the stilly solitudes of the
great Australian bush, and in rapturous enjoyment of the radical
change in the manner of living, you thread your way through the
fragrant forest, "dipping tired feet in some cool flowing brook."
Here and there you happen on the home of the "hardy
pioneer"&mdash;the man on the land. But he does not appear to be
prosperous in these parts; mostly crude and unlovely in his
habitation, yet, as far as can be judged, not dissatisfied that the
number of his days shall be accomplished far from the rush and
turmoil of the crowd. It is, perhaps, according to the eternal
fitness of things that he resolutely refuses to pay homage to the
spirit of the forest. You are shocked to hear your picturesque
valleys and mountains characterised as "hungry," and to be assured
with some emphasis that a square mile of such country would not
fatten a bandicoot. It all depends on the point of view. However,
passing several small settlements you should reach Wombeyan-Taralga
road about noon on the seventh day (fourth from Jenolan), and
turning to your left make Wombeyan Caves for tea.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Eighth Day</b></p>
<p>You will spend in an inspection of the Caves, and the
accommodation dispensed by Mr. Caretaker Chalker will sorely tempt
you to withdraw, or at least to modify, the hard things you have
said about civilised customs.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Ninth and Tenth Days.</b></p>
<p>These days will be occupied in the journey from Wombeyan to
Bowral, or Mittagong, of which detailed description is unnecessary
here (<i>vide</i> Mittagong to Mittagong, <i>viâ</i> Wombeyan and
Goulburn&mdash;Five-day Trip, <a href="#ch-2-8-1">trip details</a>
and <a href="#ch-3-4">notes</a>.)</p>
<p>It will be sufficient to say that an early start should be made,
and that the first day's journey should bring you just past Bullio
homestead&mdash;perhaps as far as the tunnel. After the
considerable experience you have had in camping out, it is hardly
likely that you will make inquiry about accommodation <i>en
route</i>. On the evening of the tenth day you will reach your
destination, be it Bowral or Mittagong, in time to have a shower
and straighten yourself out for tea. On the morrow the train will
land you at Sydney at 9 o'clock.</p>

<p>Sufficient for six or seven meals is required. This will carry
you round to Moss Vale, where your stock can be replenished; the
sleeping-bag will be needed for camping out on the way to Wombeyan
and Goulburn. If preferred, these requisites, which may be
dispensed with for the rest of the trip, can be packed and
forwarded to Sydney from Moss Vale, and the swag lightened to that

same country as that embraced by two other trips to which reference
can readily be made&mdash;Mittagong to Mittagong, <i>viâ</i>
Wombeyan Caves; and Moss Vale to Kiama, <i>viâ</i> Fitzroy and
Belmore Falls&mdash;it will be sufficient here to indicate your

(Sandstone Archway on the Road From Bowral to Wombeyan Caves.)</p>
<p align="center"><b>First and Second Days.</b></p>
<p>You should reach Mittagong on Friday evening, so as to get under
way early on the morrow. You will camp out on Saturday night, and
reach Wombeyan Sunday afternoon. Distance, 43 or 44 miles.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Third and Fourth Days</b></p>
<p>Will be occupied in resting and in inspecting the caves.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Days.</b></p>
<p>After your rest at Wombeyan, if an early start be made, you
should pass Taralga about midday, and go into camp, say 20 or 25
miles from Goulburn; or, if the weather be bad, you could make a
roadside hotel, situate some 8 or 10 miles on the Goulburn side of
Taralga. Goulburn is reached next evening, and the Melbourne
express in the morning will drop you at Moss Vale, whence you can
leisurely reach Yarrunga, by midday. The afternoon can be
pleasantly spent in viewing Fitzroy Falls and its surroundings.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Eighth Day.</b></p>
<p>Lunch at Belmore Falls, and reach Robertson for tea. Being an
easy day's journey&mdash;15 miles only&mdash;two or three hours may
be occupied at Belmore in viewing the several sights, and
refreshing yourself by a dip in one of the fine holes in the
creek.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Ninth and Tenth Days.</b></p>
<p>With these twain the appointed number of the days of the journey
is accomplished. You will reach Albion Park on the evening of the
ninth day, and making an early start, breakfast <i>en route</i>,
reach Kiama in ample time for lunch, and for the 2.29 p.m. for
Sydney&mdash;passing on the way through sweet arcadian
Jamberoo.</p>

<p>It is worth while, perhaps, to consider for a moment the
wonderful variety of scene offered by this tour. Here you have
tableland, rugged mountain ranges, and picturesque mountain passes,
limestone caves in some respects not inferior to the famous
Jenolan, rich agricultural land, waterfalls, and, finally, you
penetrate to the coast&mdash;to Kendall's Illawarra:&mdash;</p>

(<i>The Lure of the Labrador Wild</i>.)</blockquote>
<p>Having given the essential information as to routes, distances,
outfit and charges&mdash;gathered during a walking experience of
several years&mdash;it is proposed here to set down in an informal
sort of way, a few notes culled from the pages of my diary,
descriptive of the track and incidents met with on the longer
journeys mentioned in the preceding part. At the outset it should
be mentioned that a walker's diary is by no means a formidable or
philosophic affair; that it does not pretend to be a minute record
of passing events, political and domestic, with discerning comment
thereon. Nor does it concern itself with the secret musings and
conflicts. Nothing of the kind. Portability is its dominant note.
Hence, like his travelling-kit, it is of last importance that its
dimensions be restricted to the lowest point compatible with
usefulness. An ordinary pocket-book generally serves the purpose
well enough, and twenty minutes to half-an-hour after the evening
meal will be found ample to jot down the day's experience.</p>

("A Winding Road Before Me and a Three Hour March to Dinner.")</p>
<p>Mr. C.B. Fry pertinently remarks in this connextion:&mdash;"Side
by side with the camera a first-rate means of potting the cream of
one's holiday, so to speak, is a diary. Not one of those
self-dissecting volumes...No; the kind of diary should be a mere
happy frame-work upon which to renew fading memories; just an
honest, simple record of each day's events, with a plentiful
sprinkling of the jokes, the comical happenings, the scores of odds
and ends that individualised the weeks; here and there a bit of the
bare bones of description and observation. To write a good,
sensible holiday diary one must look out, not in."</p>
<p>The limit and character of the notes having been thus fairly
indicated, it is much easier to proceed.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="ch-3-2" id="ch-3-2"></a><b>KATOOMBA TO
JENOLAN CAVES.</b></p>
<p>Experienced walkers do not elect to do this trip during
Christmas holidays. As a "pipe-opener," Boxing-day is spent in
exploring the depths of Govett's Leap, Blackheath.</p>
<p align="center"><b>27th December.</b></p>
<p>Away to daylight. The first 3 or 4 miles is familiar country to
mountain visitors. From Katoomba, Bathurst-road is followed to the
famous Explorers' tree&mdash;now, alas, a stump only&mdash;thence
by Nellie's Glen to Megalong Valley. At a clear running stream at
the bottom of the Glen, billy is boiled, and we breakfast in the
fresh morning air, with the songs of the birds and the music of
falling waters in our ears, and the "fragrance of the forest in our
nostrils." There is no accommodation <i>en route</i>, and the
distance being too great to complete the journey in the day, at
this season of the year the party is provisioned for two days, and
on a liberal scale; also, there is much unnecessary clothing. The
swags aggregate a decent load for a mule, and the originality of
their get-up would have excited the ridicule of even a tyro swaggy.
For the first few miles the track is all that can be desired but
after reaching Megalong Creek it peters out entirely. From here to
the formed pathway leading to Cox's River the route had been
indicated by blazed trees, but more or less recent bush-fires had
rubbed out the trail.</p>
<p>Megalong Creek is of great assistance in this difficulty. Guided
by it and refreshed by its waters, we at length pick up the track.
The sun being desperately hot, a rest of a few hours is availed of
at midday, at Cox's River. Getting under way the distance to the
river crossing is accomplished, and the afternoon is far spent when
the weary ascent of Megalong Mountain is begun. Not that Megalong
is to be compared with Black Mountain, Cambewarra, and others that
could be named, but we tackle it with an ill-will. It has come in
the nature of a surprise. We had heard a good deal about Black
Mountain&mdash;we know all about him later on&mdash;and were
expectant, but nobody had mentioned Megalong. After may tiresome
windings, pulls at the water-bottles, and vain speculations as to
"this being the last lap," the summit is reached at dusk.</p>
<p>Camp is suggested; but water must be had, and there is none. On
through the gathering darkness for some distance, when of a sudden
comes the joyous sound of running water; and then the outline of
the old hut is made out, and we know that it is Little River at
last. It is recorded somewhere that Mahomet gazed from the arid
heights outside the city on the rivers of Damascus, and feared to
go in lest he should be tempted to stay. We could not see 20 yards
ahead, but never strain of music sounded more sweet and beautiful
than the evening hymn of that diminutive stream as it rushed down
the mountain side eager to join the Cox. One gets a taste for water
on a trip such as this which is surprising. While billy is boiling
we bathe by candle-light. An inspection made of the abandoned hut
disturbs a kangaroo-rat, or something of the kind, from its nest in
a corner of the old fireplace; and creepy, uncanny noises come from
the old bedroom. Whereupon, it is decided to camp in the open,
overhead the stars, and great mountains hem us round. Not that is
mattered much, for nobody slept.</p>
<p align="center"><b>28th December.</b></p>
<p>Refreshed only by the keen mountain air, a start is made as soon
as it is light. The famous Black Mountain confronts us. Precaution
is taken to fill the water-bottles and billy. The walking is good,
but the grade is steep. On top of the mountain we encounter a hot
westerly, and by the time we reach the Mt. Victoria Caves road our
water bottles were empty. In our quest for a fresh supply we happen
on a legitimate swaggy. The hospitality of the road is our
introduction. "Got a pipe o'bacca, mate?" One remark leads to
another, and it transpires that swaggy in his day had been a
considerable acrobat. A sometime star of some magnitude in
Ashton's, St. Leon's, Burton and Taylor's Chiarini's, and almost
every circus of any note that did business in this State a quarter
of a century ago. At sixty odd he stands wonderfully erect, has
clean well-shaped limbs, and is confident that he can do a
forty-step sandjig without a break, or a "back-flip." Exhibition of
his marvellously-preserved powers would have been appreciated, but
no one has the hardihood to suggest it. Yes; if we turned down the
mountain side a couple of miles ahead, near a broken-down dray we
would strike good water. We did this subsequently. He had come
across from Taralga <i>viâ</i> Shooter's Hill. No, nothing much
doing. Never saw things worse. Harking back to the old game;
everybody should have a horizontal bar on his premises. If he had a
dozen children, everyone should start on the bar so soon as he
could walk. "Adds twenty years to your life, sir!" He had noticed
that we are more or less tender-footed. "Get a basin of cold water,
put a bit of salt into it, and stand in it as long as you can; then
rub some olive oil into your knees. You won't know yourselves in
the morning." Which injunction I regret to say we neglect. You so
soon forget pain and fatigue.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-47.jpg"><br>
(The Willows, Jenolan Caves.)</p>
<p>No need to attempt detailed description of the chaste loveliness
of the caves; that has been done many times. But one or two things
call for passing remark. The accommodation at Caves House is good,
and all things considered, the tariff&mdash;10s. per day&mdash;is
not more than might be expected. The guides know their business,
are painstaking, and are civil even when replying to oft-repeated
and silly questions. Your daily programme is made for you, and
there is not a slow moment. The midday interval is just sufficient
for lunch, rest, and smoke. The season being in full swing, it is
estimated that during our stay there was never fewer than fifty
visitors. Yet examination of visitors' book showed that not more
than six hailed from Sydney. 'Twas ever thus. When the Westralian
Caves become the fashion, no doubt many Sydney folk, who have not
seen Jenolan, will visit them. Objection has been taken by some to
the installation of the electric light in the caves. Let us free
ourselves of cant. Having had an opportunity of viewing Wombeyan
without, and Jenolan with this improvement&mdash;or
disfigurement&mdash;I am bound to say that there does not appear to
be much in the objection. And in this connection it was noted that
there are beautiful clusters of stalactite in various places, quite
inaccessible to the rays of the magnesium lamp, and for the
adequate display of which the electric service appeared to be
peculiarly adapted. Hot westerlies still prevail, and on the last
day of our stay we meet in committee of the whole, and decide to
return by coach. We have rarely since taken the track earlier than
Easter, or later than October, and this is the solitary instance in
which a trip has had to be abandoned.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="ch-3-3" id="ch-3-3"></a><b>WENTWORTH
FALLS TO CAMDEN.</b></p>
<p>Nowadays accommodation is to be got at Wilson's hotel,
convenient to Wentworth Falls railway station and to Cox's River
road. But at the date of the journey under notice, this caravansary
did not exist, and our train&mdash;a crowded and belated
excursion&mdash;did not reach Wentworth Falls until 1 a.m. Neither
myself nor my companion felt like demanding accommodation at that
hour of the morning, and, moreover, the only hotel was right out of
the way. So it was decided to do a perish in the station
waiting-room. Sleep was out of the question. It was blowing
bitterly cold; we were destitute of rugs or other means of keeping
up the temperature, and, in desperation, shouldered our swags ere
it was quite daylight, and commenced to cast the miles behind us.
How bitterly cold the wind blew across King's Tableland may be
gathered from the fact that, going at a shade over 4 miles an hour,
with sweater and coat on, it was still difficult to keep
comfortably warm.</p>
<p>The Queen Victoria Home authorities had recently acquired a nice
property here, and extensive alterations were in progress. Except
for some difficulty in getting water for breakfast, the journey
along the mountain ridge was uneventful; but the view over Cox's
River Valley and the lower Burragorang gave ample compensation.
Everybody has his favourite mountain view; may be it is Govett's
Leap, Mount York, Jamieson Valley, or Kanimbla Valley. Having had
many opportunities of viewing all of these under different
conditions, I take the risk of affirming that Burragorang is not
inferior to the best of them. It is a canvas such as a
Brobdingnagian artist might have used. Away to the right through
the haze overhanging Jamieson Valley the eye descries what appear
to be outlines of Black Mountain; in front and to the left are
precipitous and fantastically fashioned sandstone cliffs; while
down through the valley at your feet the silver strip of the Cox
winds and glitters through the cornfields.</p>
<p>The descent of the mountain is long, and so steep in places as
to render it very difficult for vehicular traffic. Mr. McMahon's
hospitable homestead is reached towards the evening, and as we have
compassed some 23 miles, a dip in the Cox serves to put a fine edge
on already respectable appetites. Excellent fruit is grown here,
but sheep and pigs appear to be the staple product. Throughout the
Burragorang it is the same. At every farm maize is the crop, and
you find the pigs running through it at their own sweet will. "We
drive the crop to market," said a farmer; and this is precisely
what is done. Maize is for the most part grown for use as pig-feed,
and the pigs having fattened are driven to market. The McMahon
homestead is large and unpretentious, of the style of architecture
it is customary to describe as rambling. "I suppose I'll have to,"
is Mr. McMahon's dry reply to the inquiry "Can you accommodate us
for the night?" But the house is clean and homelike&mdash;looks as
if people occupied it&mdash;and the hospitality is willingly
extended.</p>
<p>The kitchen fireplace furnishes an excellent index to the
character of the inmates, and I regret that I have not a "snap" to
present to you. Of equal width with the rest of the building, one
corner holds a large range; in another corner is a lounge, which
provides the cosiest of reading quarters for the long winter
evenings; and into the centre great logs many feet in girth and
length are rolled. A cheerful log fire throws out its generous
warmth, while we eat oranges and listen to the stories of a
strapping son of the house. Up the river a native dog has been
killing the sheep; yonder hangs his skin. For several nights our
entertainer had rolled himself in a rug and wearily watched; but a
native dog knows nearly as much as a man. At last he comes within
range; it is just about daybreak, and with hands almost frozen the
prize is secured. Had they any cricketers or footballers in the
valley? Oh! Yes, "a fair few." They had accounted for Picton and
other more pretentious places.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Second Day.</b></p>
<p>As our day's journey is to be a rather easy one&mdash;some 15 or
16 miles&mdash;start is delayed until after breakfast.</p>
<p>That the season is an exceedingly dry one is everywhere
apparent, and the valley is filled with stock from less favoured
parts. Even here the drought is pressing heavily, and it is
necessary to cut up cornstalks for fodder. Thus usefully employed
by the roadside, we encounter a gentleman of Spanish parentage,
named F&mdash;p&mdash;k, than whom no man is better known in the
Burragorang. Now he is accounted a "slim" visitor who gets through
the valley without being interrogated as to his route by Mr.
F&mdash;p&mdash;k. There are the customary interchange of
courtesies, and more or less wise predictions as to the duration of
the drought. We are assured that Mr. F&mdash;p&mdash;k could have
filled his house with visitors had he so elected; documentary
evidence is available at the house, and some well-known names are
mentioned&mdash;mostly artists. But his word is sufficient for us;
besides the house is set upon a hill. Still Bert is curious. "What
is it that attracts visitors?" "Fetches em! Why it's the bally
tucker we sticks into 'em."</p>
<p>Camp for lunch is made at what is known as Fitzpatrick's
Crossing, on the Wollondilly. While this interesting function is in
progress an idle and talkative resident happens along carrying a
gun. No, not much shooting&mdash;thought he might get a rabbit or a
duck. His eyes open to their fullest when it is learned that we are
walking, and for fun. Nobody walks hereabouts. If we would care to
vary the monotony by a little exploring he could put us on to an
unfrequented, if somewhat rough track. "Start to-morrow morning
along the Warragamba, and you can get to Penrith in time for
dinner." The temptation is great&mdash;the fascination of
penetrating to the Nepean by goat trail,&mdash;but it is considered
wiser to adhere to our itinerary. Having since spent some days at
Wallace and paid special attention to the Warragamba channel, I
know that it is possible to get to and from Burragorang by this
rugged route; but it was also made manifest that the estimate as to
time for the journey was very wide of the mark. Some day, perhaps.
To the track again, and King's (more recently Pippin's) is reached
for tea. This is an accommodation house, and is situate on the bank
of the Wollondilly, at the foot of the "jumpback." Two bedrooms are
demanded, but it is found, eventually, that one room and one bed
only available. Though limited, the accommodation is satisfactory,
and, anon, two tired fellows sleep the sleep of the righteous.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Third and Fourth Days.</b></p>
<p>Camden could easily have been reached on the third day out, but
as we are not due in Sydney until the evening of the following day
it is decided to saunter along and lunch at the Oaks, and "take
one's ease at one's inn" until the morrow. The country between
Burragorang and The Oaks is uninteresting, and the road much cut up
by heavy traffic from the Peaks. The old road out of Burragorang
has just been superseded. The grade of the new road is much easier,
but the famous view from the "jumpback" is missed. At the top of
the mountain an arch of rude design, bearing the word "Welcome,"
and other remains bear evidence to the recent date of the opening
celebrations. The late Mr. E. W. O'Sullivan, then Minister for
Public works had been the idol of the feast.</p>
<p><i>En route</i> to The Oaks a wine-shop is met with, and we have
a curiosity to sample the vintage. The front name of the proprietor
is Ephraim, and his hearing being defective some difficulty is
experienced in gaining admittance. Nor is this the only trouble. It
is Sunday&mdash;Easter Day, in fact&mdash;and the good and trusty
Ephraim has scruples. It is represented that as <i>bona fide</i>
travellers we are entitled to such refreshment as his house may
afford, and, the objection being overcome, question is put as to
the wine in stock; is it hock, Chablis or claret, port or muscat?
But its name is not disclosed, and we have to be satisfied with the
assurance that it will do us more good than any of the wines named.
As might be guessed, it turned out to be an ordinary sweet red
wine, probably a local product. Our stay at the Oaks was most
enjoyable. Judged by the notes in the visitors' book, Hennessey's
is a popular hotel. We find E.W.O'S writ large, and many names
familiar to us, amongst others that of a Public Service writer of
verse, who had been moved to inscribe the annexed
jingle;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>'Tis a charming run when summer's done<br>
If you want a ride in reason,<br>
To pedal down thro' Camden town<br>
To the Oakes in Easter season.<br>
<br>
There's nothing sure like cycling tour,<br>
To make one light and airy,<br>
With a cup of tea, or two or three,<br>
From a black-haired saucy fairy.<br>
<br>
Now what I write is just as light<br>
As a zephyr, kiss, or feather,<br>
But the house is full, and I'm full,<br>
And we're all full together.</blockquote>
<p>Next morning we stroll into Camden in time for lunch, and a
ramble around the historic town; then take train to Sydney.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=

<p align="center"><a name="ch-3-4" id="ch-3-4"></a>MITTAGONG TO
MITTAGONG, VIA WOMBEYAN CAVES, TARALGA, GOULBURN, MOSS VALE, AND
BERRIMA.</p>
<p>Wombeyan was the real objective. It had been the land of heart's
desire for quite a long time, but from one cause and another had
been postponed. Having arrived at Mittagong over night an early
start is made on Saturday morning, following for some distance the
old railway line of Joadja mine. Presently the road from Bowral to
Wombeyan is met with. For the most part the country is undulating,
with homesteads at easy intervals. Here and there we happen on
recently taken up land; house new&mdash;to be completed some day;
fences in course of erection; trees ringbarked and fresh-felled.
The month being November, the day is hot for walking, and we are
grateful for a re-fill of our water-bottles from the iron tank at
the little Ebenezer by the roadside. Anon the character of the
country changes, becoming rough and sterile, with the ranges away
in the distance; we pick up the new road, and lunch at the tunnel.
This tunnel, penetrates a narrow sandstone ridge, and is the means
of maintaining an excellent grade. It had been ascertained before
leaving Sydney that there was no public accommodation-house <i>en
route</i>, but assurance from a responsible quarter had been given
that hospitality might safely be relied on at &mdash;&mdash;, a
small sheep station about halfway to Wombeyan, or at a prosperous
selector's, 2 miles nearer to Mittagong.</p>
<p>The latter place had hove in view too early in the day to go
into camp, and the owner of &mdash;&mdash; deciding that it was not
worthwhile to strain his accommodation for our convenience, we
pushed on to the Wollondilly, a distance of some 10 miles&mdash;33
from Mittagong&mdash;and camp in the open. Covering of any kind we
have none, but are well supplied with food. Of course, no complaint
is entered. The absolute right of this gentleman to refuse shelter
to a couple of more or less vagabond-looking swaggies is not
disputed. An in extenuation it might be said that &mdash;&mdash; is
only a miniature station, the accommodation of which is very
limited. At the several bends in the road as it descends the
mountain fine reaches of the Wollondilly come into view, and,
finally, just about dusk we scramble down the bank and go into camp
right in the river bed.</p>
<p>The night is fine and warm, there is abundance of drift wood at
hand, and the mosquitoes are quiet. Tea is discussed with relish,
while the stars blink at us. We next build up the fire&mdash;listen
to the crackling of the she-oak, and watch the spectral figures
come and go&mdash;while we dispose our weary shapes as comfortably
as may be on the dry drift sand. For the time the enthusiastic and
not untuneful bush orchestra, which has been with us all day, is at
rest; even the interrogative thump, thump, of the startled and
thirsty wallaby is only heard at intervals as he approaches the
water. No difficulty is experienced in maintaining a good fire, and
a clear conscience and the weariness resulting from a 30 odd miles
walk enable us to get snatches of sleep.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Sunday.</b></p>
<p>In the early morning comes a change in the weather. Fine rain
commences to fall, and continues to do so during our ascent of the
mountain&mdash;7½ measured miles. The grade is excellent, but you
feel quite satisfied when the top is gained. Yet the views are
magnificent. Hemmed in by great mountains you gradually&mdash;very
gradually&mdash;climb up through the mist. Acceptable shelter is
afforded by an old hut&mdash;Martin's Lookout&mdash;and here we
breakfast. Resuming, the intervening distance is soon compassed,
and we report ourselves at the caretaker's house, Wombeyan, about
10 a.m. The walk across from Mittagong&mdash;about 44
miles&mdash;had occupied a day and a little bit. Being some hours
in advance of our time, and the place being empty of visitors, we
find Mr. Chalker away from home; but the afternoon is whiled away
pleasantly enough under the oaks.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Monday</b></p>
<p>is occupied in an inspection of the several caves. We start
early and finish late. No detailed description will be inflicted.
Wombeyan is much more fortunate in its situation than Jenolan.
While at the latter the hills have had to be cut into to make room
for the few structures necessary for the accommodation of visitors
and employees, at Wombeyan a spacious flat, sufficient to provide
the site for a moderate-sized town, stretches itself out between
the hills. The caves&mdash;Wombeyan and Jenolan&mdash;are like and
unlike. Jenolan is far more extensive, better known, easily
reached, has electric light, and in other ways has had much money
expended in making its treasures accessible to the tourist.</p>
<p>In comparison the arrangements at Wombeyan are of the crudest,
notwithstanding which its native glories are such that in some
respects it is superior to Jenolan. The shawls, for example, are
wondrously tinted, and easily transcend their kindred at Jenolan.
But Wombeyan must of necessity lag behind pending the establishment
of a regular coach or motor service. And there is another matter.
We were assured that it is competent at a reasonably small cost to
construct a road joining Jenolan and Wombeyan. If this were done
the route would be from Mount Victoria, <i>viâ</i> Jenolan and
Wombeyan, to Moss Vale, Bowral, Mittagong, or Goulburn, or <i>vice
versa</i>&mdash;a round trip, the equal of which it would be very
difficult to indicate on the planet. I had almost omitted to
mention the courtesy received from the caretaker. Mr. Chalker was
most attentive to our wants, entertained us with good stories, and
with many historic facts concerning the opening out of the Caves;
the accommodation was in every way satisfactory, and the charges
were moderate&mdash;6s. to 8s. per day, exclusive of expenses
incidental to inspection.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Tuesday.</b></p>
<p>Swag and billy is the order. Once gained, the top of the range
is followed for some miles. As Taralga is neared the country opens
out into splendid agricultural land, for the most part locked up in
one huge estate, to the everlasting hindrance of the prosperity of
the district; at least so saith local gossip. Pursuing the even
tenor of our way, the little village famous for its potato crop is
entered at midday. The intention had been to bring up at a hotel 10
miles further on, reaching Goulburn next day, but disappointment is
part of man's inheritance, and a heavy storm causes a modification
of the programme. In point of fact, a sound drenching had been
escaped by a very narrow margin. So sudden and violent is the storm
that a team of bullocks standing in front of our hotel becomes
utterly demoralised, and threaten serious damage to property ere
the driver can regain control. Though fortunate in the respect
mentioned, much valuable time had been wasted, and the highway is
to a large extent under water. At which juncture the
Taralga&mdash;Goulburn mail coach offers a way out of the
difficulty. Goulburn is reached about 9 p.m.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Wednesday.</b></p>
<p>With assistance of the Melbourne express we breakfast at Moss
Vale, preparatory to a delightful and easy day's tramp to
Mittagong, <i>viâ</i> Berrima. The day being hot, opportunity is
taken to have a dip in the Wingecarribee, and in the fullness of
time we pass through the quaint and withal prettily situated
village of Berrima, of recent years chiefly remarkable for the
"solitary" dispensed at its penal establishment. Stories of
Berrima's pristine opulence are extant, which, having regard to its
present dignified restfulness, are incredible. It was in what are
known as the "roaring" days, when all team traffic of the Great
Southern Road took this route. At which period the faithful
chronicler alleges a thirst settled on Berrima like unto which the
historic Barcoo is not so much as a circumstance. Through no fault
of our much respected and vigilant Canon of St. Paul's the figures
have not been preserved, and the annual drink bill can only be
roughly estimated by the prodigious number of licensed houses that
existed&mdash;-the owners of which rapidly reached a condition of
pride and affluence. Life was fast and furious, and the dispensing
of "tanglefoot" a profitable business. All this has passed for
ever. But though "Ichabod" is writ large everywhere, the situation
is attractive, and such a seductive restfulness obtains that
Berrima offers an ideal asylum to the tired city man: here with
pipe and book and, perchance, fishing tackle, he may,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Spend the long warm days<br>
Silent beside the silent-stealing streams,<br>
To see, not gaze,<br>
To hear, not listen; thoughts exchanged for dreams.<br>
<br>
See clouds that slowly pass,<br>
Trailing their shadows o'er the far faint down,<br>
And ripening grass,<br>
While yet the meadows wear their starry crown.<br>
<br>
To blend at last with Nature and to hear<br>
What songs she sings<br>
Low to herself when there is no one near.</blockquote>

(The Hawkesbury River near Windsor.)</p>
<p>We boil our billy, lunch, and tramp on through interesting
country, staying only to drink of the waters of the famous
Chalybeate spring, whereof I fill my old canvas-bag for the
experience of city friends. Mittagong is reached in time for a
shower and the evening meal. Next morning per express to
Sydney.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="ch-3-5" id="ch-3-5"></a>EAST MAITLAND TO
WEST MAITLAND, VIA MORPETH, HINTON, CLARENCE TOWN, DUNGOG, AND
PATERSON.</p>
<p>We, Australians, are accounted a pleasure-loving,
holiday-keeping public, and by common consent Easter is the popular
holiday of the year. The explanation is easy. The temperature is
such that out-door exercises may be entered into with zest, most
folk are just recovered from the effects of a long and distressing
summer, and our excellent practice of extending the holiday over
four consecutive days is fairly general. Good Friday, 1905, broke
an ideal day for the track, and, as the late G.P.R. James might
have written, "shortly after dawn the observant early riser might
have remarked four swagmen on the highway to Morpeth. Sound of wind
and limb, and elastic of step, their sandals spurned the
earth"&mdash;but, my native modesty...The famous and fertile valley
of the Hunter, and in fact the country everywhere, was looking its
best consequent upon recent and bountiful rains. This is not wild,
picturesque country&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>By gaping gorges and by cliffs austere,</blockquote>
<p>abounding in beautiful leaping cataracts, foaming waterfalls,
and uncanny spirit-haunted ravines. By way of distinction it might
be described as pretty country.</p>
<p>From the highly cultivated Hunter Valley you pass into cleared
and timbered land, mostly devoted to sheep and cattle raising and
dairy-farming. Up and down the magnificent broad channel of the
Williams, unlovely but busy little steamboats are plying, bustling
along to drop empties and pick up full milk-cans at the several
wharves. The day is warm, the river is clear and inviting, but fear
of sharks prevents the enjoyment of a dip. Several fishing parties
are met with camped on the bank of the river. Clarence Town is
reached in ample time to permit of a dip in the Williams before
tea. In the early morning a lucky meeting with an itinerant baker
had enabled us to celebrate the day in the orthodox way, and our
luck still followed us. Tinned fish is served for tea.</p>
<p>On the top of a 23-mile walk in an exhilarating atmosphere,
living on fritz, fruit, and biscuit, anyone of us would have
preferred a hot meal, but established custom is triumphant. The
evening is occupied in various ways: for the most part in listening
to the anecdotes of "Old Bill," an aged and kindly gentleman who,
recognising the courtesy visitors might properly expect of his
village, had imposed on himself the task of entertainer. Among
other things it transpired that in his day, somewhere in Riverina,
"Old Bill" had taken a pull at the Archimedean lever. It had only
been a modest weekly sheet, price 6d., which had struggled manfully
to fashion and direct public opinion. The story is old as it is
pathetic. In good seasons subscribers paid spasmodically, in cash
and in kind; in bad seasons the "Thunderer" was the first luxury
retrenched. Postponed obligations had one day to be met, and the
venture petered out after five or six years of struggle,
semi-starvation, and disappointment.</p>
<p>One story may serve to indicate the economical spirit of the
public to whom the "Thunderer" carried its weekly message. When not
engaged in writing leaders or crisp and caustic comment on passing
events "Old Bill" would "notice" mammoth pumpkins, &amp;c., left at
the office by clients anxious for cheap advertisement. And in this
connection he one day visited the home of a boss-cocky, attached to
which was, perhaps, the finest orchard on the lower Lachlan. The
owner had kindly piloted him through the garden, stopping here and
there in front of a tree bending to the ground with ripe fruit, to
mention the name, and expatiate on its rare flavour. Finally, as
they were leaving the orchard, he pulled a fine ripe peach, and
breaking it, handed "Old Bill" half, remarking, "Now that's wot I
calls a peach." "Old Bill" called it several other things.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Saturday.</b></p>
<p>An early start is made. Having, at some trouble, secured a few
excellent shortloin chops, and with the aid of a few feet of
rejected fencing wire grilled the same, we sacrifice to the
fleshpots of Egypt, and resume our swags like giants refreshed. Our
road is through undulating country, fine cleared paddocks mostly
occupied by dairymen on the river side. The river is only a short
distance from us at any time, and at midday we cross the
intervening paddock, and rest and bathe for a few hours. Clarence
Town to Dungog is an easy journey&mdash;15 or 16 miles only; hence
we can afford to loiter and luxuriate. It is a superb day, bright
and warm; the kind of day which impels a walker to sing:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Wealth I ask not, hope, nor love,<br>
Nor a friend to know me;<br>
All I ask, the heaven above<br>
And the road below me.</blockquote>

(Group of Typical North Coast Ferns and Palms.)</p>
<p>Clarence Town being at the head of navigation of the Williams,
and the port for Dungog, so to speak, there is considerable traffic
between the two townships. Many well-appointed turn-outs pass, and
it is observed that our party excites much rural wit. A couple of
miles out of Dungog we encounter a genial gentleman whose face and
accent proclaim his nationality.</p>
<p>"Its a foine day."</p>
<p>We agree that it is.</p>
<p>"Is it looking for work ye are?"</p>
<p>Somebody furnishes a negative.</p>
<p>There is an enthusiastic desire for information on the part of
our interrogator, and we gracefully submit, at the same time
contriving to get some particulars anent local hotels. But he is
not taking many risks, and steadfastly refuses to recommend any.
From Clarence town side Dungog breaks upon you all at once, and the
effect is good. The town is situate on a gentle slope adjacent to
the Williams River. It is only a small place, but has a prosperous,
go-a-head appearance, numbering several well-built business houses
and private residences. Our reception is doubtful. We demand
accommodation at an hotel, are regarded with some suspicion, and at
first assured that there is no room. On second thoughts a large
room at the top of the building is offered. Inspection discloses a
very ordinary sort of barn, containing four or five stretcher-beds,
which might have passed had inquiry as to a shower-bath been
satisfactory. A "shower," forsooth! What manner of swaggies be
these? There is a bath "down the yard," to which the water has to
be carried or pumped. As none of the party is eager to do this
service, we thank the good folk and go elsewhere, and are
excellently suited.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Easter Sunday.</b></p>
<p>The usual early start is made. For the first 2 or 3 miles we go
back in our tracks of yesterday, and then bear away to the right to
Wallarobba. The country is much the same as we passed through on
the previous day&mdash;mostly grazing land stocked with cattle. The
little hamlet of Wallarobba does not concern us much and presently
we are ascending the "Mountain" of that name. Said mountain is only
a very small affair as our experience goes, but the zigzag track on
Paterson side is not unattractive. Acting on advice, we leave the
main road about 3 miles after crossing the range, and follow the
travelling-stock route. This is a shade shorter, and crosses the
Paterson near Mr. Elliott's very snug model farm. Here is a
splendid water-hole. As we rest after lunch, some of the locals
come down to bathe; they splash in and out, complain of the
temperature, and tell uncanny stories about the depth of the hole.
Among other things, it is alleged that the blacks are afraid of it,
and no man had found its bottom. This opens the way to a
demonstration. We are not concerned about its depth, but in a very
short time four well-tanned Warragambas get all over its surface.
This is not an uncommon experience in the country. Late autumn and
winter bathing does not obtain, and invariably there is a hole in
the river or creek, which it is alleged the blacks cannot bottom.
Passing through the Upper Paterson, truly a lovely country,
comprising for the most part fertile river flats, an easy stage
brings us to the pretty, if somewhat straggling village of
Paterson, where we rest for the night.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Easter Monday.</b></p>
<p>Only 12 miles to go, so there is no anxiety about an early
start. Breakfast promised at 6 a.m. Like the cautious Mistress
McLeerie, we ha'e our doots, but for the first time in our
experience, it is served to the minute, and hot, too. The walk to
West Maitland is pretty. We go by way of Tocal, and have the
willow-fringed Paterson on our left throughout. From the heights a
magnificent view of the Hunter Valley is obtained. Later on we come
into close contact with the cultivated area&mdash;the famous
lucerne fields. The holdings are apparently of small acreage, but
they are as closely filled as a kitchen garden. No a square yard is
wasted. I am assured that the productiveness of the Burrundulla
flats at Mudgee exceeds the Hunter Valley, but that is a question
for the farmers and the statistician to settle.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1301331h-images/swag-billy-51.jpg"><br>
(Wallis Lake from Forster.)</p>
<p>As we meander along we have the luck to fall in with an old
sundowner, who has come from out west and is making towards the
Richmond River. He has been at Dubbo and Bourke, is tired of the
west, has come down through Mudgee, and is making to Lismore for a
"feed of fish." He is an old man, carries a bulky
swag&mdash;probably all his belongings&mdash;and has every
indication of a wanderer on the face of the earth. By this time, no
doubt, we present a dust-stained, not to say vagabond appearance,
and as the Hunter bridge is crossed have the satisfaction of being
mistaken for genuine swaggies. We stop to watch a fox-terrier
swimming below: an old man is similarly engaged.</p>
<p>"Looking for work?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Not much chance. Never knowed things worse."</p>
<p>"Any likelihood of a job of fencing?"</p>
<p>"No. The Government gives you coves a railway pass to the
country, and doesn't care what becomes of yer."</p>
<p>We feel hypocrites, but it were a pity to disillusion him, and,
besides, our vanity. We must look like the real thing.</p>
<p>"Oh, well, s'long."</p>
<p>"S'long, and good luck to yer."</p>
<p>A change of raiment is awaiting us at West Maitland, which
having assumed, we lunch and catch the afternoon to Sydney. This is
a fairly easy trip: it cuts up nicely&mdash;23, 16, 23, and 12
miles. There are no big hills to climb, and accommodation is to be
got each night at moderate rates. Good views of the Hunter,
Paterson, and Williams rivers, the roads are good, and excellent
bathing is easily obtained.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="ch-3-6" id="ch-3-6"></a>BOWRAL TO KIAMA
VIA KANGALOON, ROBERTSON, KANGAROO RIVER, BROGER'S CREEK,
WATTAMOLLA, AND THE MOUNTAIN RANGE (SADDLEBACK, &amp;c).</p>
<p>Bridle-track hunger was heavy upon us: at different times we had
"done" to satiety the several highways which lead from the
tableland towns to the South Coast, and it was determined on this
journey to use the main road only when it could not be avoided.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Sunday.</b></p>
<p>With this intent the president and the writer set out from
Bowral at daybreak. Not that there was any need to get under way at
that hour, seeing that the day's walk was to terminate at
Robertson&mdash;15 miles only; moreover, the morning was clear and
frosty, and so stimulating the air that, had it been desired,
Robertson could have been reached by midday. But, as mentioned
elsewhere, it is the practice of the Warragambas to breakfast and
lunch on the track. At Robertson a curious thing happened. While it
is common enough to meet and hear of parties of walkers at this
season, cyclists are generally well represented; but this evening
the only tourists who ate at the excellent dinner provided by Mrs.
Carter ("Royal Hotel") were walkers. The others&mdash;two
parties&mdash;had come across by Fitzroy and Belmore Falls from
Moss Vale.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Monday.</b></p>
<p>This morning we enter the bush proper, and for about forty hours
get right away from the haunts of ordinary traffic.</p>
<p>Robertson may be left by two tracks which meet on the mountain
top ere the descent to upper Kangaroo River. One track bears away
to the right from the Macquarie Pass road, a short distance out of
Robertson; the other branches off to the left from the
Robertson-Belmore Falls road about 3 miles out of Robertson. The
former is indicated by a notice "To Fountaindale." We took this
track but never sighted Fountaindale, nor any person who could
direct us to it, and the Robertson-Belmore Falls track is
recommended. Arrived at the mountain edge, Kangaroo Valley was
found to be enveloped in thick fog, but what was lost in general
view was subsequently compensated for in the glimpses of fairy-land
to which the fog introduced us.</p>
<p>Here and there as we descended, the proximity of homesteads
could be roughly judged by the sound of the axe, and the more or
less musical voices of dairy cattle. The foot of the mountain
reached, our track followed the course of the Kangaroo River for
some miles. This was a most interesting part of the journey. The
river, now noisy, now silent, rushed along a few feet below, with
the mountain range rising high on either side, from the fertile, if
steep, slopes, of which prosperous looking dairy farms looked down
at us. As the day advanced and the fog rose, some beautiful effects
resulted: at one moment it appeared as if a narrow strip of cliff
were suspended from the skyline, in some danger of being
precipitated on unwary tourists; and it required no great effort of
imagination to associate projecting headlands with mammoth
ruins.</p>
<p>Having declined the kindly invitation of a party of road-makers
to "have a drink of tea out of the billy," we rest, have a dip in
the stream, and lunch a few miles further on. This function over,
the river is crossed, and course set for Broger's Creek. For some
miles this creek, a fine clear, strong-running stream, only
slightly inferior to the river, is followed; eventually wading
across, Berry-road is joined. The afternoon is bright, and as the
road gently ascends, a delightful panorama, embracing valley,
stream, and mountain, is presented, added to which the
comfortable-looking homesteads suggest a general prosperity. Here
the chief industry is dairy-farming. Over the rich pasture lands
which fringe Broger's Creek roam healthy, well-conditioned dairy
herds, and it is recognised that you are among a people who are
getting a satisfactory return for their labour and outlay.
Particular cases of hardship could, no doubt, be cited: even as we
passed, an "evicted" family proceeded to its new and temporary home
with some lamentation; but inquiry elicited that the family, while
sympathised with, was held to be mostly responsible for the
misfortune that had overtaken it.</p>
<p>Hotel or other public accommodation at Wattamolla there is none,
but, through the kind intervention of a friend, Mr. W. Brandon had
consented to come to the rescue, and, tired and hungry, a sumptuous
entertainment awaited us. Hot water to bathe our feet, a cheerful
fire blazing, and&mdash;what might be called the height of
hospitality&mdash;a juicy turkey-cock, taken in the flower of his
youth, done to a turn, and garnished with such vegetables as were
in season. Perhaps most delightful of all was the feeling that the
hospitality was heartily extended. Some music, a smoke, and then to
bed.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Tuesday.</b></p>
<p>Awake at daybreak, but we were among early folk, and breakfast,
substantial and piping hot, thoughtfully prepared by Miss Brandon,
was ready at 6 o'clock.</p>
<p>Our route lay by Berry-road to Woodhill; thence by cattle tracks
along the mountain range at the back of the Fox Ground, descending
to Kiama by Saddleback. Steady rain commenced to fall as we climbed
up to Woodhill, and continued to do so until the plateau was
reached. Mr. Brandon had some anxiety as to our finding the track,
and very kindly proposed himself as pilot. Of course, this was not
to be thought of, and, although very indistinct in parts&mdash;at
the best but cattle pads&mdash;little if any difficulty was
experienced. After rejecting the turn off to the left at the
mountain top, which leads to Robertson, if it be borne in mind that
while the tracks, in skirting gullies, often appear to bear
overmuch to the <i>left</i>, their general trend is to the
<i>right</i>, no mistake can well be made.</p>
<p>At its top the mountain forms a barren, sandy, wind-swept
plateau, which recent rains had rendered somewhat sloppy. A bright,
clear day had succeeded the clouds and rain of early morning, and
magnificent views to the south were obtained; but with Saddleback
it was, as Macaulay said of Boswell, a case of Eclipse first, and
the rest nowhere. However the beauty and extent of this view has
been fully dealt with in <a href="#ch-2-6-7">three-day trip, No.
