<h2><a id="chapA1" name="chapA1">1. PROWL</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE AVENGER was on the prowl tonight.</p>

<p>Swiftly, the word spread through the slimy alleys and the dark
corners of the great city's underworld. Hard men who flaunted the
police and scoffed at the law sought hurried cover as the word
reached them.</p>

<p>At fly-specked bars, in closed and shuttered rooms, men buzzed
in furtive whispers: "What's he after? Has anybody got the dope?
Who's The Avenger gunning for?"</p>

<p>Those were the questions which flew around on the wings of
fear.</p>

<p>Down at police headquarters, Inspector Cruikshank listened to
the whispered voice of a stoolie over the phone and hung up with a
worried frown.</p>

<p>"It's The Avenger," he said to Dolson, his chief aid. "He's on
the hunt, They say he's out for big game. What the devil can he be
after? What's on the books these days?"</p>

<p>Dolson scowled and scratched his right ear. "Who can tell, sir?"
he growled. "It might be Gregorio Ruiz, or Nick Frogash&mdash;"</p>

<p>Inspector Cruikshank groaned. "I hope it isn't Ruiz. That devil
is too big for us to tackle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And for The Avenger, too!" Dolson broke in, "If Dick Benson is
going after Gregorio Ruiz, there'll be fireworks in town
tonight!"</p>

<p>"I better find out!" said the inspector. He flipped down the
switch of the interoffice communication system and spoke into the
box. "Get me Justice, Inc.," he ordered.</p>

<p>A moment later he had his connection, and a voice said over the
phone, "This is Justice, Inc. Smith speaking."</p>

<p>"Listen, Smitty," said the inspector. "What's this I hear about
your boss? What's he on to?"</p>

<p>"On to?" Smitty repeated, in a tone of surprised innocence.
"Why, what in the world are you talking about, inspector?"</p>

<p>"Lay off, Smitty," Cruikshank growled. "You know damned well
what I'm talking about. Word is traveling on the underworld
grapevine that The Avenger is on the prowl. Now listen, I just want
you to tell me one thing&mdash;is Dick Benson out after Gregorio
Ruiz?"</p>

<p>"I'll ask him, the next time I see him, inspector," Smitty said,
and hung up.</p>

<p>Inspector Cruikshank swore fluently as he cradled the phone.</p>

<p>"Smitty isn't talking!" he told Dolson. He reached for his hat,
"I'm going out and see if I can find The Avenger, before the big
guns begin popping. You, Dolson&mdash;order out every man in your
detail. Have them comb the town. Whoever spots The Avenger, have
him phone in. Put it on the shortwave radio. I'll pick it up
wherever I am!"</p>

<p>Dolson saluted the inspector's retreating back and got busy on
the interoffice phone. Within a matter of minutes, the police
department was a bustling beehive of frantic activity.</p>

<p>Two blocks away from headquarters, in the terrace apartment of a
twenty-story apartment building that overlooked the East River, a
man stood upon the terrace, staring down at the murky waters of the
river, far below.</p>

<p>He was a tall man, with the nose of a hawk and the look of a
falcon and the eyes of a devil incarnate, His lips were thin and
bloodless, and his hands were long and sensitive, like the hands of
an artist.</p>

<p>This man was in a black mood indeed. There was a dark unreadable
look in his eyes, and his thin lips twitched spasmodically. His
hands gripped the terrace railing tightly, as if they would rip it
from its moorings.</p>

<p>His eyes, it seemed, were focused upon a single spot down there
in the river, a spot near a crumbling and disused dock. But it was
strange that his attention should be centered upon that spot, for
there was nothing there&mdash;no life, no movement.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the man with the hawk face swung around and stepped
through the tall French windows into the lighted room beyond.</p>

<p>It was a great room, with costly drapes, rare oil paintings and
curios and knicknacks from all parts of the world. Near one corner,
under a fluorescent light, was an easel with a canvas resting upon
it, Upon the canvas was an unfinished oil painting of a demure girl
of nineteen or twenty, technically excellent but tinged with a
strangely evil note. There was terror in the girl's eyes and
revulsion in her face. The artist who had worked upon that canvas
must have been one who gloried in the sight of terror.</p>

<p>The man with the hawk face brushed past the easel and stopped in
the middle of the room, where three men stood waiting, their hats
in their hands, servile and eager to please. Though they were
hardbitten men, there was a lurking tinge of fear in their eyes as
they watched this hawk-faced man.</p>

<p>He stood very still, looking at them for a full space of sixty
seconds. And then, when he spoke, his voice was almost gentle. He
was holding himself in check. He was not permitting the passion
within him to burst its bonds.</p>

<p>"I want The Avenger!" he said, between grated teeth. "I want him
dead or alive. I want him tonight! Do you understand, you
three?"</p>

<p>The three men nodded their heads. The one on the left wet his
lips.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Ruiz," he said.</p>

<p>The second one swallowed hard. "Yes, Mr. Ruiz."</p>

<p>The third one spoke quickly, as if he wanted to get it over
with. "Yes, Mr. Ruiz."</p>

<p>"Bah!" exclaimed Gregorio Ruiz. His eyes blazed as he mimicked
them. "'Yes, Mr. Ruiz; yes, Mr. Ruiz!' Is that all you know how to
say?"</p>

<p>His long finger lanced at the first of the three, a husky fellow
with close-cropped black hair and a twisted nose. "You, Jasper!"
His eyes swung to the next. "And you, Degnan. And you, Lithro. You
three have been provided with men and money enough, to accomplish
anything at all in this city, not excepting murder. Is it so hard,
then, for you to capture or kill one man?"</p>

<p>Jasper was the boldest of the three. "That one man&mdash;he's
The Avenger, Mr. Ruiz. He's tough, that guy. And so are his
pals&mdash;that Smitty; even the dame, Nellie Gray. They're tough,
and they play for keeps." Then, seeing the terrible wrath rising in
the eyes of Gregorio Ruiz, he added hastily, "But we'll get him
tonight. Don't worry; we'll get him tonight!"</p>

<p>Ruiz turned away from them. He strode out on to the terrace once
more. Again, as if drawn by some terrible fascination, his eyes
fixed upon that spot in the river, near the old and rotting dock.
He spoke to them over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Somebody squealed to The Avenger about that thing that's out
there in the river. We don't know how much the squealer told. But
we can't afford to have The Avenger find that thing out there. Do
you all understand?"</p>

<p>Once more there was that chorus of, "Yes, Mr. Ruiz."</p>

<p>Gregorio Ruiz sighed. He came back into the room.</p>

<p>"Come," he said. "I see that I shall have to take charge of
this, myself. Listen to me closely, you three. I shall tell you how
we will trap The Avenger&mdash;"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chapA2" name="chapA2">2. SMOKE OUT A KILLER!</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IF Gregorio Ruiz and Inspector Cruikshank were
both worried about The Avenger's activities tonight&mdash;each for
a different reason&mdash;perhaps they both had more cause for
concern than they thought. As for Gregorio Ruiz, had he known
exactly where The Avenger was at that particular moment, his rage
might have burst all bounds.</p>

<p>That terrace apartment of Ruiz's was two blocks east of
headquarters. Only a couple of blocks south of headquarters was the
Criminal Courts Building. And here, on the third floor, a jury of
seven men and five women was deliberating behind locked doors, on
the fate of one man. That one man was Barney Dorset.</p>

<p>The trial of Barney Dorset had lasted nineteen days. A
procession of sixty witnesses had occupied the witness chair during
Dorset's trial for murder in the first degree. Now, the jury was
considering all the mass of evidence which had been placed before
it. It had been locked in at eleven o'clock that morning. The judge
was sleeping on a cot in his chambers, so that he would be on hand
the moment a verdict was reached. The district attorney was pacing
up and down in his office, and the defense counsel was engaged in a
poker game with some reporters and bondsmen in a bonding office
across the street from the courthouse.</p>

<p>The defendant himself was under heavy guard in the detention
room on the main floor.</p>

<p>And it was just outside the courthouse that The Avenger might
have been found, had anyone known where to look for him.</p>

<p>The long, powerful sedan of Dick Benson was parked on the side
street, only a dozen feet or so from the north entrance. Dick sat
in the back, with Nellie Gray behind the wheel. Tonight, Nellie was
acting as chauffeur. But, to look at her, no one would have guessed
that Dick's chauffeur was, in reality, a daintily fragile blonde.
Her golden-blond hair was piled high on her head, hidden by a
chauffeur's cap. The curves of her slim, girlish figure were hidden
by a gray whipcord uniform, and her hands were incased in huge
leather gauntlets.</p>

<p>Sitting in the rear, Dick Benson&mdash;The Avenger&mdash;was
hardly more recognizable. He was attired in the complete outfit of
a city fireman, with hip boots, fireproof coat and helmet, and a
gas mask, slung by a strap over his shoulder. He had a long-handled
ax at his side, and his face was liberally covered with soot. To
look at him, no one would have thought he was other than a
hard&mdash;working, tired, city employee.</p>

<p>Only his eyes indicated the driving resolve and the iron will
which had made of him the one man whom the underworld feared and
hated more than anyone or anything else.</p>

<p>It was he&mdash;this Dick Benson&mdash;who meted out punishment
to those malefactors who were too big and powerful for the law to
touch.</p>

<p>The long arm of The Avenger reached out where no man with a
badge could legally go. And all over the world, men knew that if
their cause was just, they could seek out that little street in the
heart of New York where a small sign read: "Justice, Inc." There,
they could find the help which the duly constituted authorities
might be powerless to give.</p>

<p>Tonight, The Avenger was engaged in just such a
mission&mdash;justice beyond the power of the law.</p>

<p>He sat, apparently at ease, with one eye on his wrist watch.
Headphones were adjusted to his ears, and he was speaking into the
mouthpiece of the powerful but compact short-wave
sending-and-receiving set which was built into the car. A
distorting device enabled him to speak in absolute privacy with
Algernon Heathcote Smith, at the headquarters of Justice, Inc.</p>

<p>"All set, chief," Smitty was saying. "Inspector Cruikshank
phoned, but I gave him the brush-off. He hasn't got the faintest
idea what we're up to. He's placed a couple of men outside here, on
Bleek Street. But if you use the secret entrance, they'll never
spot you."</p>

<p>"Right, Smitty," said Dick Benson, glancing at his watch. "Zero
hour is 8:15. Synchronize your time. I have 8:13.5."</p>

<p>"Right, chief. 8:13.5."</p>

<p>"Signing off, Smitty."</p>

<p>"Good luck. Signing off!"</p>

<p>Dick Benson removed the headset, placed it on a hook of the
radio set and pressed a button. The set receded under the seat, a
panel slid shut, and it was no longer visible.</p>

<p>Nellie Gray was watching him.</p>

<p>"Everything ready?" she asked.</p>

<p>The Avenger nodded. "Go to it, Nellie. Smitty will be phoning
the alarm in less than a minute and a half."</p>

<p>Nellie smiled. This diminutive girl, endowed with the courage
and skill which many men would have envied, had preferred to work
by the side of The Avenger in his constant warfare against crime,
rather than to seek one of the many glamorous careers which might
have been open to one as beautiful and attractive as she. And she
performed the duties assigned to her perhaps better than any
man.</p>

<p>She slipped out of the car, walked swiftly to the corner, and
threw a hasty glance around to make sure the cop on the beat was
not in sight. Their timing had taken the cop's routine into
consideration. At this moment, he would be at the other end of the
beat, but those who worked with The Avenger had been trained always
to be doubly sure. It was one of the many reasons why they, who
took such numerous and terrible risks, were still alive and
healthy.</p>

<p>As soon as Nellie was sure the cop was not in evidence, she
reached up to the firebox and pulled the handle. This would flash
the alarm at fire headquarters, which, in turn, would flash it over
the fire department's telegraph, to the nearest pumper company.</p>

<p>At the same time, Smitty would be phoning in to say that he was
a passer-by who had noted smoke issuing from the top floor of the
Criminal Courts Building. This would insure that the dispatcher at
fire headquarters would also send hook-and-ladder apparatus in
addition to the pumper. Benson wanted as many pieces of fire
apparatus as possible at the scene.</p>

<p>After pulling the fire alarm, Nellie Gray strolled back, past
the entrance of the building. From the pocket of her whipcord
uniform, she took a small round object, about the size of an
orange. She hurled this object in through the open doorway.</p>

<p>There was a tinkling sound, as of broken glass, and a moment
later, thick smoke began to billow out.</p>

<p>Nellie continued on to the car and slipped in behind the
wheel.</p>

<p>Dick Benson's eyes were on his wrist watch.</p>

<p>"Good timing, Nellie," he said. "It took you just a half minute
to get to the box and a half minute to walk back and throw the
smoke bomb. That brought it to 8:15. The engines from the fire
house take ninety seconds to get here, which should bring it to
8:16.5."</p>

<p>They waited till they heard the clang of the engines, around the
corner. Then Dick Benson picked up his ax and stepped out of the
car. He set off at a run for the side entrance. At the same time, a
fireman from the pumper which had arrived at the front came running
around the corner. Dick waved him back.</p>

<p>"I'll take this door!" he yelled.</p>

<p>The fireman thought, perhaps, that Dick was one of his own crew,
who had gone in the front, come through the building and out this
entrance. He was satisfied and turned back.</p>

<p>Dick adjusted his gas mask, covering his face entirely, and
plunged into the cloud of smoke emanating from the courthouse.</p>

<p>He had a complete plan of the layout of the building in his
mind, so he did not need to see through the smoke to find the
detention room where Barney Dorset was being kept under guard.</p>

<p>The smoke was spreading so thickly that it had filled most of
the main floor. But when Benson got close to the door of the
detention room, he could see two guards milling around in front of
it, with their hands at their eyes. The smoke bomb which Nellie had
thrown had been especially constructed for this purpose by Fergus
MacMurdie, another member of The Avenger's band, who was perhaps
the most skilled chemist in the world. In addition to the
smoke-producing chemical, the bomb which Nellie had thrown also
contained a small quantity of xylil bromide, which is a highly
effective, though absolutely harmless, form of tear gas. Those two
guards would see nothing for perhaps twenty minutes, but their eyes
would be all right again before morning.</p>

<p>The Avenger slipped around behind the two milling guards, and
fitted a key to the door of the detention room. He had taken the
precaution to prepare this key in advance and knew that it would
work.</p>

<p>He pushed open the door of the detention room.</p>

<p>The smoke had not yet penetrated here. Barney Dorset was seated
in a chair, handcuffed, with a cigarette between his lips. He was a
surly brute of a man, with a stocky chest and a pair of long and
powerful arms. He had done many a killing at the order of Gregorio
Ruiz. Throughout the trial, he had not been greatly worried,
because he knew that Ruiz would take care of him. Twice before, he
had been tried for murder, and the case had gone to the jury. But
in some strange and unaccountable fashion, the juries had found
verdicts of "not guilty," despite the weight of evidence. He was
quite sure that this would be the case now, too, and his demeanor
indicated this feeling of assurance.</p>

<p>There were two guards on duty inside this room, both armed with
sawed-off shotguns. One of them had gone to the window at the
arrival of the fire engines, but the other remained at his post,
tautly watching the prisoner.</p>

<p>At Dick Benson's entrance, the guard exclaimed, "Say! Is it a
bad fire?"</p>

<p>He assumed, of course, that Dick was one of the firemen, and
that the guards outside had opened the door for him.</p>

<p>"Not bad," said Dick. The smoke rolled in with him, filling the
room swiftly. The guard's eyes began to tear, and he raised a hand
to rub them. At the same time, the other guard, at the window,
began to rub at his eyes, too.</p>

<p>Dick Benson stepped over to the first one, took a small pellet
out of his pocket, and cracked it between his fingers, right under
the man's face. The guard got one whiff of the powerful anaesthetic
chemical which the pellet contained, and his head drooped.</p>

<p>Swiftly, Dick repeated the procedure with the second guard. In a
moment, they were both unconscious.</p>

<p>It was beginning to be difficult to see through the smoke which
was pouring in from the corridor, but Barney Dorset hadn't missed a
thing.</p>

<p>"Hey," he exclaimed. "What goes on? You ain't a real
fireman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you fool!" Dick Benson snapped. He had dropped to one knee
beside the unconscious guard and was going through his pockets. He
found the man's keys, and sprang to Barney Dorset's side. Swiftly,
he unlocked and removed the handcuffs.</p>

<p>Dorset's eyes widened. "I get it! Greg Ruiz sent you. He's
pulling this phony fire to get me outta here!"</p>

<p>"Follow me," Dick said curtly. "Keep your eyes closed, so the
smoke doesn't hurt them. Hold on to my coat. And don't lose
me!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, pal," Barney Dorset said with a wide grin. "I
ain't anxious to stay in this hole. If Ruiz is pulling this play to
get me out, it means he couldn't reach the jury this time. But I
don't get it. He told me everything was fixed. Something must have
slipped up."</p>

<p>"Never mind the talk," Dick Benson told him. "Save your breath.
You'll need it."</p>

<p>His gas mask afforded him protection against the tear gas and he
felt his way out of the building, with Dorset hanging on to his
coat.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chapA3" name="chapA3">3. PRISONER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IN the street, a great crowd had gathered, and the
police had established safety lines. Just before emerging, Dick
stripped off his fireman's uniform and boots, together with the gas
mask, and dropped them on the floor. When he and Dorset emerged,
they looked like two civilians who had fought their way out of the
smoke.</p>

<p>"Keep your face covered with your arm," Dick whispered to him.
"Act as if your eyes hurt."</p>

<p>"I don't have to act," Dorset growled. "I kept them closed, but
they sting like the devil, anyway." He chuckled. "Boy! Ruiz is the
smartest guy in the world. Imagine walking right out through the
police lines like this!"</p>

<p>Uniformed men helped Dick and Dorset to the curb, and they
climbed into the waiting car. As soon as they were inside it,
Nellie Gray backed it down the street, with policemen waving them
on, glad to get the auto out of the way. In a moment, they had
backed around the corner, and Nellie headed the car uptown.</p>

<p>Dorset sat back, reclining at ease, his brutish face mirroring
triumph. "It's good to work for a guy like Ruiz. He sure takes care
of you. No wonder he's got the city eating outta his hand. Take me,
for instance. I'd shoot the mayor to death on the steps of city
hall, if Greg Ruiz gave the word. Cause why? Because I know Ruiz
would get me off!"</p>

<p>He took a deep whiff of his cigarette as the car sped north, and
allowed the smoke to dribble luxuriously from his nostrils.</p>

<p>"I swear by Gregorio Ruiz!" he said.</p>

<p>Nellie Gray turned her head slightly and uttered a low, amused
laugh.</p>

<p>"Brother," she said, "you'll soon be swearing at Gregorio
Ruiz!"</p>

<p>At the sound of the feminine note in her voice, Barney Dorset
froze, with the cigarette halfway to his lips, his eyes on her
trim, whipcord-clad shoulders.</p>

<p>"Hey," he said. "You're a dame!"</p>

<p>He turned his head slowly and, for the first time, took a good
look at Dick Benson. His eyes became wide, and flecked with terror,
as he recognized the face of the man in whose car he was
riding.</p>

<p>"The Avenger!" he gasped.</p>

<p>Dick Benson nodded. "That's right, Dorset. That jury back at the
courthouse wouldn't have convicted you. Your boss got to them. But
it will be a little harder for Ruiz to get you out of this!"</p>

<p>With a cry of rage and terror, Dorset flung himself at The
Avenger. But Dick Benson's hands moved with uncanny swiftness, and
before the killer realized what had happened, he was helpless in a
punishing arm lock.</p>

<p>Benson held him so for a moment, then flung him back
contemptuously in the seat.</p>

<p>Dorset stared at The Avenger like a caged and helpless animal
which has suddenly learned that its keeper's whip has mastered it.
He licked his lips. The fight was gone out of him.</p>

<p>Dick took another one of the pellets from his pocket. Holding
his own breath, he stretched out his hand and broke it under
Dorset's nose. The killer went lax as the powerful drug acted upon
him. He slumped down, unconscious.</p>

<p>Nellie Gray tuned in the shortwave radio on the dashboard to get
the police calls. The announcer was frantically calling all cars.
The escape of Barney Dorset had been discovered. All policemen were
cautioned to be on the watch. All exits from the city were being
blocked. But The Avenger's name was not mentioned in connection
with the escape. Nellie switched off the radio.</p>

<p>"Chief," she said, over her shoulder, "I think you're a
wonder!"</p>

<p>"Don't crow, yet, Nellie," The Avenger said soberly. "We haven't
licked Ruiz. Our gamble is that this will bring him out in the
open; that he'll try something desperate to rescue Dorset and leave
himself unguarded. But he's pretty clever. From now on, the
watchword is 'constant alert.' We can't tell where or how Ruiz will
strike back."</p>

<p>He pressed the button which brought the sending-and-receiving
set out and once more got contact with Smitty.</p>

<p>"Operation completed successfully, Smitty," he said. "We're
approaching headquarters from the rear. All clear?"</p>

<p>"All clear, Dick," Smitty reported. "You can come in."</p>

<p>Nellie swung the car into the next street behind Bleek, where
the headquarters of Justice, Inc., were located. In the middle of
the block was a public garage, which appeared innocent enough to
the casual observer. But the moment the car rolled in, a service
mechanic waved it on, down toward the rear. Nellie swung the car
down a ramp which led into the basement. There were many cars
parked here, and at one end of the basement was a greasing pit.</p>

<p>Nellie drove the car onto the pit. Immediately, an overhead door
came down, shutting them off, in absolute privacy from the rest of
the floor. The whole greasing rack began to descend, like an
elevator. A moment later, they were in a wide, concrete tunnel,
large enough for the car to move through, with room to spare on
either side, but with no illumination.</p>

<p>Nellie Gray switched the headlights on, drove down the length of
the tunnel, bringing the car to a stop at a blank wall.
Immediately, the whole section of floor on which the car rested
began to rise. In a moment, they were in the private garage of
Justice, Inc., on Bleek Street.</p>

<p>This was the means of ingress and egress which The Avenger used
when absolute secrecy was of paramount importance, or when the
headquarters were under surveillance. In addition to the buildings
on Bleek Street, Dick Benson was the secret owner of all that
property on the entire square block. The public garage through
which they had come was operated by a man who was in debt to Benson
for his life and who was deeply devoted to him, and the employees
of the garage were all trusted men who had seen service with The
Avenger in many parts of the world.</p>

<p>There was never any danger of betrayal in the ranks of those who
worked for Justice, Inc.</p>

<p>Dick Benson lifted the inert form of Barney Dorset out of the
car and slung him on his shoulder. With Nellie leading the way, he
carried him through the connecting passage, into the main building,
and up a flight of stairs.</p>

<p>Smitty was waiting for them there, grinning.</p>

<p>"Inspector Cruikshank is upstairs in the office," he announced.
"And is he mad!"</p>

<p>"I'll talk to him now," The Avenger said, "if you'll take this
off my hands."</p>

<p>Smitty grinned, and took over the burden of the unconscious
Dorset. He didn't bother slinging Dorset over his shoulder. He just
carried him under his arm.</p>

<p>Algernon Heathcote Smith, research engineer and electrical
wizard, was a giant of a man, looking like some towering Viking god
of old, descended fresh from Valhalla to stride among mortal men.
When his parents had sent him to Groton and then to Cambridge and
Edinburgh, they had never thought that his brilliant and studious
mind would ever find interests outside the cloistered halls of some
sedate university.</p>

<p>But the crusade which The Avenger waged against crime had
attracted Smitty's allegiance, and his greatest happiness was to
risk his life daily in the constant war which Justice, Inc., was
waging against the forces of evil.</p>

<p>He carried Barney Dorset as if he were a child's stuffed doll,
rather than an inert man weighing a hundred and eighty pounds.</p>

<p>"I'll put him in the yellow room," he said. "Cruikshank would
never find that room&mdash;even if he got a search warrant and went
through this place with a hundred men!"</p>

<p>Benson raised his eyebrows. "Is it that bad, Smitty?"</p>

<p>"It's worse than that!" laughed Smitty. "Cruikshank is on the
warpath. He threatens to go right out and get a search
warrant!"</p>

<p>Smitty left, with Dorset under his arm, and Dick Benson turned
to Nellie Gray. He patted her on the shoulder. "That was nice work,
tonight," he praised her. "Better go and change. Get rid of that
chauffeur's uniform."</p>

<p>He hurried upstairs, to the waiting room, where Inspector
Cruikshank was champing at the bit, pacing up and down and
listening to the radio. The announcer was babbling excitedly about
the escape of Barney Dorset and hazarding a number of theories as
to who had planned and arranged it.</p>

<p>Cruikshank shook an angry finger at Dick. "Look here,
Benson&mdash;I know damned well that you're the one who got Dorset
out. Where is he? What've you done with him?"</p>

<p>"My dear inspector!" protested The Avenger, "are you accusing me
of helping a murderer beat the law?"</p>

<p>"I know how you'll help him beat the law, Benson. You won't kill
him yourself. But you'll arrange it somehow, so that he'll be found
floating in the river some morning. Mind you, I'm not saying that
isn't justice. Dorset wouldn't have been convicted. I know, and you
know, that Ruiz is back of him, and nobody that Ruiz backs ever
goes to the chair. But, man, you've set the city on its ear. I was
afraid you'd do something fantastic, but I never guessed at this.
When the word came in that you were prowling all the dives, I sent
men out to find you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," The Avenger said. "But you should have come
straight here if you wanted me, Cruikshank. You see, I'm here now.
And you've had men watching this place since eight o'clock. They
didn't see me come in, did they?"</p>

<p>Cruikshank nodded bitterly. "You've got half a dozen ways of
getting in and out of here, Benson. I swear I'm going to take this
joint apart one of these days."</p>

<p>"But not tonight, inspector. You'll excuse me? I'm
busy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now wait, Benson. Don't give me the bum's rush. I want Dorset.
You've got to turn him back!"</p>

<p>"Why?" The Avenger's voice cracked like a whip.</p>

<p>"You violated the law, Benson. Do you realize you could get
twenty years for what you did tonight?"</p>

<p>"How do you know Gregorio Ruiz didn't do it?"</p>

<p>"Ha! Because Ruiz called me up the minute the escape was
flashed. He's burning up. He's afraid you'll make Dorset talk. He
didn't say so, but anybody can guess that's why he's so hot about
it. He was hot before, when he found out you were gunning for him.
There's something he's afraid you'll discover&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's right," The Avenger said quietly. "And I mean to
discover it tonight!"</p>

<p>Cruikshank looked at him queerly. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Come," said The Avenger. "I'll show you!"</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="chapA4" name="chapA4">4. TRAPPED BLONDE!</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DICK led the inspector out of the room, down a
corridor, then up a short half flight of stairs. He rapped lightly
at a door, and an elderly, high-pitched voice said, "Come in,
please."</p>

<p>The Avenger pushed open the door, and they entered.</p>

<p>Cruikshank stared at the single occupant of the tastefully
furnished guest room. It was a little old lady, with gray hair
neatly combed and her wrinkled face alight with eagerness. She put
down her knitting and stretched forth a hand to Dick.</p>

<p>"Mr. Benson!" she exclaimed, almost pathetically. "Have...have
you any word of my Laura?"</p>

<p>Dick went over to the chair and touched her hair lightly.</p>

<p>"Not yet, Mrs. Trent," he said in a voice that was surprisingly
gentle. "But I hope to have something definite&mdash;tonight."</p>

<p>There were tears in Mrs. Trent's eyes. She tried to take Dick's
hand and kiss it, but he withdrew it gently.</p>

<p>"I wanted you to meet Inspector Cruikshank," Dick said.</p>

<p>The old lady peered at him through her spectacles. "We've met
before," she said dryly.</p>

<p>Cruikshank was embarrassed. "Why...er...yes. I believe Mrs.
Trent came to see me yesterday, about her daughter who had
disappeared."</p>

<p>"She didn't just disappear!" Mrs. Trent snapped. "She was taken.
Taken by those devils who work for Gregorio Ruiz. I told the
inspector the whole story&mdash;how Laura came home that night from
work. She's a waitress in a restaurant, and she works till 9:30.
She walks home along the River Drive, and she saw the boat out in
the river, and she saw how they lifted the poor man up in the boat.
He was tied and gagged, and he had something heavy around his feet.
They threw him overboard, and he sank!</p>

<p>"It was raining hard that night, and Laura was hurrying, but she
was so shocked she stopped in the rain, unable to move. Then there
was a flash of lightning, and she saw the face of one of the men in
the boat. The men saw her at the same time, and they turned the
boat toward shore. Laura ran all the way home. She told me what she
had seen, and I said she should go to the police."</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Trent stopped, and ran a finger under her glasses, to
wipe away the tears. Then she went on: "But Laura never got to the
station house. Those men must have followed her home, and waited
outside for her. She didn't come back. Those men must have taken
her away!"</p>

<p>Inspector Cruikshank coughed. He looked shame-facedly at The
Avenger. "Mrs. Trent told me the story. We dragged the river at the
spot she mentioned, but we didn't find any body. So we didn't
believe her story. We merely filed Laura Trent's name with the
missing-persons bureau."</p>

<p>"I know," The Avenger said. "But wasn't that the night that Lou
Marconi disappeared? He was the bookmaker who was trying to buck
Gregorio Ruiz."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right. But just the same, we didn't find the
body."</p>

<p>"Isn't it possible that those men dived for the body, after they
learned that Laura had seen them, and brought it up and dropped it
somewhere else?"</p>

<p>"Of course it's possible," Cruikshank admitted. "But what can we
do about it? If we arrested Ruiz on a charge like that, he'd be out
in ten minutes, And he'd sue the city for false arrest!"</p>

<p>"Maybe you can't do anything about it, Cruikshank," The Avenger
said softly. "But I intend to do something! I'm going to see if I
can save Laura Trent"&mdash;he lowered his voice so that even the
inspector barely heard him&mdash;"if it isn't too late!"</p>

<p>He took Cruikshank by the arm and led him out of that room,
nodding to Mrs. Trent as he closed the door behind them.</p>

<p>In the corridor, his grip tightened on the inspector's arm. "I'm
keeping that old lady here," he said tightly. "It's the only place
in the city where she'll be safe from Ruiz. And, in case you're
interested, that's the reason why Ruiz was so burned up when he
heard I was out after him. He guesses where Mrs. Trent is. And he
guesses what she's told me."</p>

<p>Cruikshank looked at him queerly. "You think it was Ruiz himself
whom Laura Trent saw in that boat?"</p>

<p>The Avenger nodded.</p>

<p>"Ruiz's ace killer, Barney Dorset, was in jail. I happen to know
that two of his other top killers were in Chicago on a little job.
He had Jasper and Degnan and Lithro, of course, but he wouldn't
trust them alone on a piece of business like that. So it's quite
likely that he supervised it in person."</p>

<p>The inspector's eyes were very thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Jove! If that's true, Benson, you're on the track of
something!"</p>

<p>The Avenger said quietly, "And do you still want me to turn
Barney Dorset over to you?"</p>

<p>Cruikshank avoided his gaze. "Er...suppose you forget that I've
seen you, Benson. Let's just imagine that I didn't find you in. And
the best of luck to you!"</p>

<p>The hands of the two men met in a tight grip. Then Inspector
Cruikshank turned and hurried out.</p>

<p>The Avenger went swiftly to his office on the top floor. Smitty
and Nellie were already there, waiting for him.</p>

<p>"I've got Dorset nice and cozy in the yellow room," Smitty
chuckled. "He came to, but he's as jittery as a Jap in a Chinese
laundry. I think we can make that baby talk!"</p>

<p>"What about Mrs. Trent?" Nellie asked. "Is she all right?"</p>

<p>The Avenger nodded. "I promised her that we'd have some word
about her daughter tonight."</p>

<p>He picked up a phone from the battery of instruments on his
desk, consulted a notebook, and dialed a number.</p>

<p>Smitty and Nellie watched him tensely.</p>

<p>"I hope this works!" Nellie said fervently, and added: "For Mrs.
Trent's sake!" Dressed in feminine clothing, with her blond hair
falling to her shoulders, Nellie Gray reminded one of a dainty and
fragile Dresden doll, which one might hesitate to touch for fear of
shattering it. But many a hardened criminal had discovered, to his
sorrow, that Nellie's looks were entirely deceiving, when it came
to a good fight.</p>

<p>The Avenger got his connection. "Hello," he said. "I want to
talk to Arnie Jasper."</p>

<p>In a moment, he was talking to one of the three men who had been
present in Gregorio Ruiz's terrace apartment, earlier that
evening.</p>

<p>"Jasper," he said coldly, "this is Richard Benson. No, don't say
anything. You needn't deny that you're connected with Ruiz. I want
you to deliver a message to him. Tell him that I'm ready to make a
trade with him. Understand? If he wants to do business, have him
call me immediately, at Lakeside 7-7777. Good-by!"</p>

<p>And he hung up.</p>

<p>The three of them waited tensely, for perhaps four minutes. Then
the phone rang.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Smitty.</p>

<p>Nellie Gray's eyes were shining. "Then Laura Trent is still
alive!" she whispered. "Otherwise Ruiz would not have anything to
trade for Barney Dorset!"</p>

<p>The Avenger picked up the phone slowly.</p>

<p>"Benson? This is Gregorio Ruiz. You wanted to talk to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said The Avenger. "I believe you have something I want.
On the other hand, I have something you want. I suggest we make a
trade."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're talking about!" Ruiz said carefully.
"But I'm interested. Just what do you mean?"</p>

<p>The Avenger's voice was stern. "Let's not beat around the bush,
Ruiz. I'd like very much to keep Dorset. I can make him talk and
get enough out of him to finish you. But I'm willing to give up
that chance, to save the life of Laura Trent. If she's still alive,
we can trade. If she's dead&mdash;Heaven help you!"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. Then Ruiz's voice, low but clear.
"I'll trade, Benson. Where can we discuss the details?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere you say."</p>

<p>"I'll meet you at the information booth in Grand Central Station
in fifteen minutes. That's the best place to talk. There are no
walls to listen. I'll bring one man with me, and you bring one man.
I want your word that you won't attempt anything against my
personal safety during our talk."</p>

<p>"You have my word," Benson said coldly.</p>

<p>"Good. And I give you my word that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't have to give me your word, Ruiz. It's no good. I'll
take care of myself!"</p>

<p>"All right then," the other snapped. "I'll meet you in fifteen
minutes!"</p>

<p>Dick Benson hung up. He looked at his two friends. "Well," he
said, "we have still to find out if Laura is alive. Ruiz may be
lying. He may have killed her already. But we'll find out soon
enough. Come on, Smitty!"</p>

<p>Nellie saw them to the elevator. Smitty chucked her under the
chin, "Hold the fort, baby. And don't make eyes at that Barney
Dorset. He's a killer-diller!"</p>

<p>"Get going, you big lug!" Nellie told him. "And don't take any
wooden slugs!"</p>

<p>Smitty chuckled. "Not me. Or lead ones, either!"</p>

<p>Nellie watched through the nickel-steel slats of the Venetian
blinds at the top-floor windows while they got into one of the cars
parked at the curb. Then she went to the teletype machine to get
the latest police releases on the search for Barney Dorset.</p>

<p>But she had hardly been there five minutes, before a red panel
light showed that she had a visitor.</p>

<p>Frowning, Nellie switched on the small television unit, which
threw on a screen a picture of the downstairs vestibule.</p>

<p>There was a dark-haired girl standing there, a girl about
nineteen or twenty, dressed in a cheap blue coat. She seemed quite
nervous and agitated and kept looking around as if afraid she was
being followed.</p>

<p>Nellie swiftly pressed the button which opened the door. She was
alone now in the building, for The Avenger's other assistants were
away on various missions, and she had the full responsibility of
the place upon her slim shoulders.</p>

<p>She watched the screen, and saw the dark-haired girl enter.
Immediately, Nellie pressed the button which closed and locked the
front door. Then she pressed a switch which transferred the image
on the screen from the outside of the building, to the interior.
Now, she could watch the dark-haired girl in the vestibule. Nellie
placed her mouth to a speaking arrangement, and said, "Come
upstairs, miss."</p>

<p>She watched the visitor step into the waiting elevator; then she
pressed another button which opened the office door, admitting the
visitor.</p>

<p>The girl entered, and looked around the strangely equipped room
in a shy and frightened manner.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you?" Nellie asked in a kindly tone.</p>

<p>The girl's dark eyes met those of Nellie. She advanced a timid
step into the room.</p>

<p>"My n-name is Dora Hayes," she said. "I...I want to s-see
Richard Benson."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Nellie, "but Mr. Benson isn't in. Perhaps I
can help you? I'm Nellie Gray, his assistant."</p>

<p>"I...I have something to tell him. It...it's about Laura Trent."
Instantly, Nellie was alert. "What about Laura Trent?"</p>

<p>"I think I know where to find her. I shouldn't be doing this.
It...it's as much as my life is worth. But Laura is my friend. We
worked in the same restaurant."</p>

<p>Nellie took her by the arm and led her to a chair. "Now, tell me
all about it."</p>

<p>Dora Hayes looked up at her pathetically. "If The Avenger were
only here! There's no time to lose. I overheard two men talking.
They were just starting to have dinner in the restaurant, and they
didn't know I was clearing the booth behind them. One of them
mentioned Laura's name. He told the other to order some sandwiches
to take out, because the Trent girl would starve if they didn't
send food down to her at least once a day. The other one laughed.
He wondered why they didn't let her starve to death, and the first
one said maybe they'd need her alive. And then when I brought the
water to their table, they told me to make up two ham sandwiches to
take out."</p>

<p>Nellie was watching the girl closely as she talked. "Do you know
either of those two men?"</p>

<p>"One of them comes in regularly. His name is Arnie Jasper. He
runs a numbers racket, I think. They're still in the restaurant. I
asked another girl to take my place and hurried over here, because
I knew that The Avenger had been looking for information about
Laura Trent."</p>

<p>Nellie Gray made her mind up swiftly.</p>

<p>"Wait here, miss!" she said.</p>

<p>She hurried out of the room, and got an extra automatic. She put
it in a special silk holster, which was strapped around her thigh.
She had a gun in her bag, but she was not overlooking the
possibility that this might be a trap of some kind. And if she
should find herself in a tight spot, deprived of her purse, she
could always get at this extra gun. She went into the next room,
and looked through a peephole at Dora Hayes. The girl was sitting
exactly where Nellie had left her, her hands clasping and
unclasping nervously.</p>

<p>Satisfied, Nellie came back into the room.</p>

<p>"Let's go, Dora!" she said.</p>

<p>"What...what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I'll get a car, and we'll go right over there. In the absence
of The Avenger, I'll handle this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please!" said Dora Hayes. "Let's not use one of The Avenger's
cars. I don't ever want to be seen in one of them. If it's ever
known that I tipped off The Avenger, my life won't be worth a
cent!"</p>

<p>"All right," Nellie conceded. "We'll take a cab."</p>

<p>She hustled Dora Hayes downstairs, and they hurried up Bleek
Street to the corner. They found a taxicab cruising down the
street, and just as they were getting into it, Dora Hayes dropped
her purse.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Nellie. "Hurry!" And she stepped into the cab
first.</p>

<p>The moment she was inside, she realized she had stepped into a
trap. For she saw Dora Hayes spring up and slam the door shut.</p>

<p>Nellie reached out for the door handle, and found there was
none. She was locked in. At the same time, a sickeningly sweet
smell began to pervade the interior of the taxi. Nellie's senses
began to reel. She struggled forward, in a vain endeavor to slide
open the connecting window at the front. She saw the face of the
cab driver, grinning sardonically in at her. Then every thing swam
before her eyes, and she collapsed!</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="chapA5" name="chapA5">5. GREASE THE SKIDS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IN Grand Central Station, the crowds of hurrying
men and women were oblivious of the tense drama which was being
played at the information booth. True, they did cast a glance or
two at the towering figure of Smitty, who loomed head and shoulders
above anyone in the vast vaulted concourse.</p>

<p>But it was not Smitty who was carrying the ball at the moment.
He was merely standing at The Avenger's side, ready to run the
interference when and if it became necessary.</p>

<p>They were facing the tall and saturnine Gregorio Ruiz, who was
accompanied by Arnie Jasper. It was like a duel at dawn, where each
man brings his second. But there were no rules of honor to this
duel, for Dick Benson well knew that no honor was to be found in
the black and evil heart of Gregorio Ruiz.</p>

<p>"All right, Ruiz," he said. "We understand each other
thoroughly. If Laura Trent is alive, we can do business."</p>

<p>"She's alive all right, Benson." Ruiz seemed to be preoccupied.
His gaze was constantly wandering to the far side of the station,
where the telephone booths were located. "And I'm willing to trade.
I can't afford to have Barney Dorset grilled&mdash;by you. He can
take anything the police hand him. But you'd know how to break him
down."</p>

<p>"We wouldn't use force," Benson said. "We have drugs. Rest
assured that he'd talk. But as I told you, I'll give him up, to
save Laura Trent's life. That isn't the end, though. I'm going
after you, Ruiz, when this deal is over. You have fair
warning."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Ruiz. His eyes wandered once more to the
telephone booths, "Now what about Laura Trent? If I set her free,
she can identify...er...the man she saw in the boat that
night."</p>

<p>"I'll guarantee that she keeps silent on that," The Avenger
assured him. "You'll have nothing to fear from her. I'll get you on
something else."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose it's a deal," Ruiz began. Suddenly, a bitterly
vindictive smile twisted his lips. A man had come out of one of the
phone booths at the far side, and had raised a hand in the air. He
waved the hand once, then disappeared in the crowd.</p>

<p>The eyes of Gregorio Ruiz gleamed with vicious hatred as he
swung his gaze back to Dick.</p>

<p>"I've changed my mind, Benson!" he snapped. "It's no deal. If
you want to do business with me, you'll have to do it on my terms,
now!"</p>

<p>The Avenger had noticed that signal. His eyes narrowed. "What
are your terms, Ruiz?" he asked softly.</p>

<p>Ruiz turned and winked at Arnie Jasper, who grinned insolently.
"You tell him, Arnie. I want to watch his dead-pan face while he
hears the news."</p>

<p>Jasper licked his lips. "It's a pleasure, boss!" He looked at
Smitty. "It's your girl friend, pal&mdash;Nellie Gray. How would
you like to see her body floating face up in the river tonight?
She's a cute trick, that dame. But she won't look so good when
she's dead!"</p>

<p>The Avenger became tense and wary. But Smitty growled deep in
his throat. "Why, you two slimy rats. If you so much as scratch
her, I'll twist your heads off your necks!"</p>

<p>He took a threatening step toward them, and Arnie Jasper became
pale and backed up. But Gregorio Ruiz did not retreat. He wiggled a
finger at Smitty.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, my overgrown friend. No violence, please. Don't
forget that golden-haired young lady of yours." He looked up at
Smitty, giving him a sour smile. "I have no doubt that you could
kill me easily with those two hands of yours. Or that Benson could
do it, too, for that matter. You see. I don't depend on strength
for my success. I depend on the gray matter up here." He tapped his
forehead. "That's why I selected this busy place for our interview.
It isn't so easy for you to use violence here, with all these
people passing. So I'm afraid you'll have to accept my terms."</p>

<p>Smitty turned and looked helplessly at The Avenger.</p>

<p>Dick Benson's gaze had never left Ruiz's face.</p>

<p>"What's your proposition?" he asked harshly.</p>

<p>"That's better!" said Gregorio. "You'll forget about the Trent
girl, Benson. She's out of this deal altogether. If you ever
thought I'd turn her loose&mdash;with what she knows&mdash;you must
have been crazy! We'll make an exchange&mdash;Nellie Gray for
Barney Dorset. And you pay me a hundred thousand dollars to boot!
Take it or leave it. I want your answer now. If you refuse, you'll
never see Nellie Gray alive again."</p>

<p>"But we'll get you, you rat!" Smitty growled. "We'll make Dorset
talk, and send you to the chair!"</p>

<p>Ruiz shrugged. "I don't think you'd sacrifice Nellie Gray in
order to get me. I think you'll do every thing in your power to
save her life."</p>

<p>"You want me to sacrifice Laura Trent for Nellie?" The Avenger
asked.</p>

<p>"Sure," said Ruiz. "What's she to you?"</p>

<p>"She has a mother who trusts me," The Avenger said.</p>

<p>Ruiz looked at him incredulously. "Then you refuse?"</p>

<p>Arnie Jasper broke in. "You're crazy, Benson! That dame has been
with you a long time. She's your friend&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said The Avenger. "Nellie wouldn't want to live at
that price. I refuse!"</p>

<p>He glanced at Smitty. "I think we need a little interference at
this time, Smitty," he said mildly.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Smitty.</p>

<p>He took a single step forward. One huge hand darted out and
seized the neck of Gregorio Ruiz. The other moved equally fast, and
seized the neck of Arnie Jasper. Then, with a quick, powerful
motion, be slammed the two heads together.</p>

<p>For all his size and bulk, Algernon Heathcote Smith was capable
of moving with the concentrated speed of chain lightning. Else, he
would not have been able to survive so long in the service of
Justice, Inc.</p>

<p>He moved so swiftly now that no one in the crowded station
noticed that quick, sharp contact of the two heads. Bone cracked
against bone, and the two men sagged!</p>

<p>Swiftly, Dick Benson stepped around and put an arm about
Gregorio Ruiz's waist. He raised Ruiz's right arm, and draped it
around his own shoulder, thus supporting Ruiz on his feet, though
the latter was semiconscious from the blow. At the same time,
Smitty put an arm around Arnie Jasper, and supported him in similar
fashion.</p>

<p>Smitty had put just enough force behind that smashing together
of the two heads to make the men groggy, but not enough to knock
them out completely. There were two reasons for this: First, they
had to have Ruiz and Jasper in a condition to talk; second, they
didn't want to carry two unconscious men through the crowd in Grand
Central Station.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of the way The Avenger and Smitty worked.
It had not been necessary for Dick to tell his giant companion any
of this. They had operated together for so long that they could
almost read each other's minds, and when they were in a tight spot,
they functioned with smooth precision.</p>

<p>So, now, they needed no lengthy conference to decide what to do.
Smitty knew what The Avenger had in mind, and Dick knew that Smitty
understood his plan of action.</p>

<p>They began to walk the two semiconscious men out through the
crowded station, moving close together. And they both raised their
voices in close harmony, singing "Auld Lang Syne." Smitty sang
bass, and then switched every once in a while to treble, while Dick
Benson took the baritone, changing occasionally to a high key.</p>

<p>As they sang, they headed for the exit.</p>

<p>A woman looked at them in disgust, and said,
"Imagine&mdash;grown men allowing themselves to get in such a
drunken condition!"</p>

<p>The woman's companion sniffed, disgustedly. "If they were my
husbands, I'd know what to do with them!"</p>

<p>Smitty, who was nearest her, turned and looked at her owlishly.
"Oh, lady," he said, making his voice thick and drunken, "what
would you be doing with four husbands?"</p>

<p>They kept going, dancing Ruiz and Jasper out into the street. A
station policeman said grimly, "Better get out of here, you
fellows, or we'll run you in!"</p>

<p>"Sure, sure," said Smitty.</p>

<p>Jasper, who was just beginning to regain his senses, started to
shout something at the policeman. Smitty lurched against him and,
at the same time, pinched his arm so hard that he uttered a yell of
pain.</p>

<p>The policeman watched them for a moment, and then turned away in
disgust.</p>

<p>The four "drunks" lurched into The Avenger's car, which was
parked at the curb. Smitty slid in behind the wheel. He was grim
and sober as he tooled the car away from the curb and headed
downtown to the headquarters of Justice, Inc.</p>

<p>In the back, The Avenger was seated between Ruiz and Jasper. He
had one arm of each twisted behind their backs, and pushed up
almost to the breaking point. He said no word to either of them.
But, as he saw them coming to their senses and preparing to cry
out, he put just a little more pressure on each of them. The pain
drained all the breath out of them, leaving them powerless to cry
out.</p>

<p>Smitty drove like a mad genius, cutting lights by a hair,
swerving in and out, but never taking his foot off the gas. It was
a testimony to his superb driving skill that he reached Bleek
Street in twelve minutes without once stopping for a light, and
without once scraping a fender.</p>

<p>They drove in through the garage, and five minutes later they
had their two captives upstairs.</p>

<p>Ruiz was pale and shaken, but stubbornly silent. Smitty picked
him up, kicking and fighting, and carried him away to the blue
room, which was next to the yellow room, where Barney Dorset was
being detained.</p>

<p>Then Smitty came down and joined The Avenger in the office, with
Arnie Jasper.</p>

<p>Jasper had fully regained consciousness, by now, but he had a
lump on the right side of his head. He was sitting in a chair where
The Avenger had thrust him, after frisking him for weapons. His
little rat eyes were watching every move which The Avenger made, at
the little experiment table in the corner.</p>

<p>Smitty took one look at the vial which The Avenger was handling
and gasped.</p>

<p>"Dick! You're not going to give him that!"</p>

<p>The Avenger turned around. His eyes were almost
expressionless.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he asked bleakly.</p>

<p>Smitty put on a good act. "But that will eat his insides
out."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Dick.</p>

<p>He came toward Arnie Jasper, with the vial in his hand.</p>

<p>Jasper's eyes were big and round, and his lips were
trembling.</p>

<p>"What...what you doing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold him, Smitty." said The Avenger.</p>

<p>Jasper leaped up, in a frantic effort to escape, but Smitty put
a big paw on him, got Jasper's legs between his knees, and twisted
his arms behind him. Arnie Jasper was helpless in Smitty's massive
grip.</p>

<p>"No, no!" he shrieked, as The Avenger bent over him, with the
oily, colorless liquid lying heavy in the vial.</p>

<p>"You know what this is," The Avenger said tonelessly. "It's
sulphuric acid. You've heard of cases where jealous women throw it
at other women. You know what it does to their faces."</p>

<p>He paused. "Well, Jasper, I'm going to feed this to you&mdash;
internally!"</p>

<p>"Have mercy!" Jasper whimpered. "In the name of pity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pity?" The Avenger said harshly. "Do you ask for pity? You who
have done Ruiz's dirty work for him? What kind of pity do you
expect when Nellie's life is at stake?"</p>

<p>He reached over with one hand and clamped Jasper's nostrils shut
in a cruel grip.</p>

<p>"When you can't breathe through your nose any more, you'll open
your mouth to get some air. Then I'll pour the sulphuric acid
in!"</p>

<p>"Give me a break!" Jasper screamed. "I'll tell you where to find
Nellie Gray!"</p>

<p>The Avenger paused, with the vial hovering above Jasper's mouth.
"What do you think, Smitty?" he asked. "Can we believe him?"</p>

<p>"Well, we can try," Smitty said. "Let him give us the dope. If
we get Nellie out safely, all right. If we don't, we'll come back
and give him the acid."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you the truth. I swear I will!" Jasper screamed.
"They took her to the Loomis Apartments, on the river. Ruiz owns
the whole place. He's got a terrace apartment on the top floor, and
he's got the subcellar fixed up for prisoners. You'll find her
there, I swear!"</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m," said The Avenger. "Do you think he's telling the
truth. Smitty?"</p>

<p>"It's true!" Jasper whined. "She's there. And that Trent girl is
there, too. She saw Ruiz and me and Degnan dropping Lou Marconi's
body in the river, uptown. Degnan followed her and picked her up,
while Ruiz and I got a diving suit and fished the body up and moved
it down the river. It's right near the Loomis Apartments now. I can
even show the cops where to drag for it&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Avenger nodded slowly. Smitty relaxed his grip on Jasper.
The frightened man got to his feet, still shrinking away from the
vial.</p>

<p>"I'd do anything not to get that stuff spilled into me. I once
seen a dame who got it thrown in her face&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This?" said The Avenger, holding up the vial. "Why should you
be afraid of this?" He turned the vial upside down, and poured the
thick, oily liquid over his own hand. Nothing happened.</p>

<p>"You see," Smitty explained, laughing, "if you knew The Avenger
better, you'd know he'd never do a thing like that to anybody, not
even a rat like you. That stuff in the vial happens to be mineral
oil!"</p>

<p>"You dirty crooks!" Jasper shrieked. "You tricked me!"</p>

<p>Smitty picked him up bodily and carried him away. In a moment,
he was back. The Avenger was waiting for him.</p>

<p>"I've phoned Cruikshank," he said grimly. "The inspector is
going to meet us at the Loomis Apartments with the riot squad!"</p>

<p>Just twenty minutes later, the Loomis Apartments were in the
hands of the police, without a shot having been fired. All those
hard killers in the pay of Gregorio Ruiz permitted themselves to be
taken like lambs when they saw the submachine guns in the hands of
grim-faced policemen who welcomed this opportunity to clean up.</p>

<p>And in the subcellar, they found Nellie Gray, recovered from the
effects of the drug and none the worse for wear. Laura Trent was
there, too, just as Jasper had said.</p>

<p>When Nellie crawled out of the camouflaged coal bin in which she
had been confined, she wiped soot from her face and grinned at
Smitty and Dick.</p>

<p>"I didn't think you boys would make it in time," she said,
brushing the golden hair back from her face. "They were going to
dump ten tons of coal into the bin, on top of Laura and me. My next
view of the river would have been when I passed up in smoke, out of
the Loomis furnace!"</p>

<p>The girl who had lured Nellie into the cab was in custody, as
well as every one of the hirelings in the service of Gregorio
Ruiz.</p>

<p>Ruiz lanced looks of murderous hatred at The Avenger, when, a
half-hour later, he was turned over into the custody of Inspector
Cruikshank, together with Barney Dorset and Arnie Jasper.</p>

<p>"Damn you!" he said. "I don't know how you did this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's easy when you know how," Smitty told him. "Just grease the
skids with a little mineral oil!"</p>

<h2><a id="chapB1" name="chapB1">1. THE BLACK TULIP</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IT is not strange that Dick Benson, as he paced
impatiently up and down the lobby of the cozy little hotel, was
unaware of the existence of Emma Puglese. For Emma lived eighty
miles away in the heart of one of the slum sections of New York
City, and Benson had never met her.</p>

<p>Yet his fate and hers&mdash;and perhaps the fate of a
nation&mdash;were inextricably bound together, by threads which the
Fates had begun to weave a long time ago.</p>

<p>At the moment, however, Benson's thoughts were far removed from
Emma Puglese, whom he did not even know. They were upon a man named
Crawford. He had driven eight miles from New York with Nellie Gray
to meet this George Crawford, and now the man was forty-five
minutes late.</p>

<p>As Benson paced up and down, Nellie Gray, demure in her slim
young beauty, stood at the window looking out at Main Street.</p>

<p>It was a pretty little colonial hotel that Crawford had chosen
for his appointment. It catered mainly to tourists, for Main Street
was part of Linden Highway, which ran right through the town of
Postville. But now, with gasoline being rationed, there were hardly
any tourists. There were only two or three patrons in the dining
room, and the clerk behind the desk at the rear was dozing
fitfully.</p>

<p>At the window, Nellie Gray kept watch. The hotel was situated
right where Main Street curved. From here the highway ran due west,
up a hill into the setting sun. And the road was as straight as a
ruler. To Nellie it looked like a broad ribbon laid carefully up
the side of the hill, disappearing over the top.</p>

<p>She brushed the blond hair from her face and said, "I'm hungry,
Dick. Why can't we eat while we wait?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we won't have time," he told her. "I've never known
Crawford to be late. If he isn't here in five minutes, we'll drive
up to his estate."</p>

<p>"But he particularly asked you not to. He was insistent when he
phoned."</p>

<p>"I know. But I'm afraid something's happened to him."</p>

<p>"He only said his chauffeur had been kidnaped. Why should anyone
want to kidnap a chauffeur?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Nellie. He said he'd explain when he met us."</p>

<p>"But if that's all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's not quite all, Nellie. He also said something about not
knowing where to turn; that the only man he could have looked to
for help had been killed today in a plane crash."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Nellie's eyes narrowed. They were pretty blue eyes, but
they were keenly intelligent. Indeed, she had to be intelligent to
be able to work with a man like Benson.</p>

<p>"The teletype!" she exclaimed. "I saw it on the teletype before
we left. Admiral Miles, of Naval Intelligence, was killed in a
plane crash at Pensacola this afternoon!"</p>

<p>In their headquarters in New York they had a teletype machine
which received, in addition to all the news services, the latest
flashes from the police departments of nine States, and the
confidential releases of the F.B.I.</p>

<p>For that headquarters, located not far from New York's East
Side, was known throughout the world as Justice, Inc. And Dick
Benson, its guiding genius, was known as The Avenger. To that
building on Bleek Street in New York, came men and women from all
the far corners of the world&mdash;men and women who could not find
justice anywhere else; men and women who found themselves beaten in
a hopeless fight against criminals in high places, beyond the reach
of the law. Those men and women The Avenger helped. For he could go
where the police dared not. His justice was neither blind nor
shackled.</p>

<p>And so it was that the poor man came to Justice, Inc., when he
had not the funds to hire a lawyer in a ten-dollar case, while the
millionaire came when it was his only hope.</p>

<p>Of all these Benson selected those matters which plainly
demanded his peculiar kind of justice. With untold wealth at his
command, and ably assisted by a close-knit circle of assistants, he
had made the name of The Avenger a synonym for ruthless war upon
injustice.</p>

<p>He had chosen to answer Crawford's call tonight, because he had
known Crawford well in other years; and though the man was wealthy,
he had mentioned over the phone that this was a matter which might
well involve the country's safety.</p>

<p>But now he was late, and Benson knew that the web of the Fates
was being tightly spun.</p>

<p>Nellie Gray stiffened as she glimpsed a car which appeared over
the rim of the hill, heading down toward town, with the sun
splashing golden behind it.</p>

<p>"Dick!" she exclaimed. "There's a car. It's a Rolls-Royce. It
must be Crawford!"</p>

<p>As they both watched the car, Nellie spoke over her shoulder.
"When Crawford called, you told me to listen in on the extension,
but I had to leave it for a moment to answer another phone. I just
caught part of something he said to you about&mdash;it sounded like
a black tulip."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dick. "He did say something about a black tulip. But
he was excited, and he jumped from one thing to another. He said
something about looking out for the black tulip."</p>

<p>"I've never heard of such a thing," Nellie said. "It must be
horrid. Imagine a tulip being all black!"</p>

<p>"During the last war," Benson said slowly, "there was a vicious
German spy who passed himself off in this country as a Dutchman. He
went by the name of Pieter van der Heusen. He killed without
compunction, and he had no mercy for men or women or children. But
he had an abnormal love of flowers. He spent all his spare time in
horticulture. It was said that his greatest ambition in life was to
develop a black species of tulip!"</p>

<p>Nellie's eyes were on the Rolls-Royce, which was tearing down
the road at a terrific rate of speed.</p>

<p>"Crawford's in an awful hurry," she said. "But tell me about
this Pieter van der Heusen. Was he caught?"</p>

<p>Benson shook his head. "No. He operated in this country all
through the war, and then he went back to Germany and retired to
grow tulips. No one knows whether he is still alive. If he
is&mdash;"</p>

<p>Benson left the thought unfinished, and Nellie said slowly, "I
wonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off, gasping, and pointed to the big Rolls-Royce. It
was nearing the bottom of the hill, but instead of slowing down for
the curve, its pace was increasing.</p>

<p>Nellie frowned. "He must have plenty of confidence in his
brakes."</p>

<p>She uttered a short cry as the car leveled off at the foot of
the hill and headed directly for the hotel, never slackening its
speed. Now, with the Rolls less than a hundred feet away, they
could clearly see George Crawford seated behind the wheel. He was
upright, and seemed to be leaning backward, and his mouth was
working spasmodically as if he were trying to shout to them. He
seemed to be wearing a voluminous white coat of some sort, which
was on backward. The car was so close to the hotel now that they
could see the coat had no lapels or buttons.</p>

<p>"It's Crawford!" Nellie exclaimed. "He must have lost
control&mdash;"</p>

<p>She had no chance to finish for she was suddenly seized around
the waist from behind by Dick Benson. He fairly lifted her off the
floor, and leaped backward toward the desk at the rear of the
lobby.</p>

<p>Benson didn't move a fraction of a second too soon, for he had
hardly carried Nellie to the safety of the desk at the rear of the
lobby before the heavy Rolls-Royce, traveling straight as an arrow,
jumped the curb and crashed head-on into the front of the
hotel.</p>

<p>The smashing impact of the immense juggernaut tore away part of
the wall and the doorway and sent chunks of plaster, brick and
glass flying in all directions. The car crashed into the lobby, its
front tires blowing out with cracking explosions like pistol shots.
The hood became a mass of bent and twisted metal. Debris came
piling down upon the car as one of the rafters in the lobby ceiling
gave way. For a moment the whole building shook as if it might come
tumbling down.</p>

<p>Then the tremor ceased, the plaster stopped falling, and the
wrecked car came to rest, half in and half out of the lobby.</p>

<p>For the space of a couple of minutes neither the clerk nor the
people in the restaurant moved. They were stunned by the sudden
catastrophe.</p>

<p>But Dick Benson released his hold upon Nellie Gray and leaped to
the side of the car.</p>

<p>Nellie shouted, "Look out, Dick, it may explode!"</p>

<p>He disregarded the warning and sprang to the door of the Rolls,
wrenching at the handle. But the door would not open.</p>

<p>The figure of George Crawford sat erect and unmoving behind the
wheel. The wheel was jammed into his chest, and the top of the car
was crushed down upon his skull. He was dead, of course, but his
body was still sitting upright.</p>

<p>Nellie Gray came up alongside of Benson and uttered a low gasp
of horror.</p>

<p>"Dick! He's...he's wearing, a strait jacket!"</p>

<p>Benson nodded grimly.</p>

<p>Crawford's torso was incased in a white strait jacket, with the
arms lashed across his chest so that he had been powerless to move
as the heavy car hurtled down the hill, carrying him to
destruction.</p>

<p>"It must have taken a fiendish imagination to conceive a thing
like this!" Benson said. He pointed to two heavy wires, running
from the steering wheel down to eye screws in the floor board. That
was what had kept the car straight and true on its coarse.
Crawford's body was also lashed to the seat so that he had remained
erect all through the wild ride. Incased in the strait jacket, he
had been helpless to do a single thing to save himself.</p>

<p>"Who could have done it?" Nellie demanded.</p>

<p>Benson was already reaching in through the shattered window.
Pinned to Crawford's strait jacket there was a white card, perhaps
five inches long and three inches wide.</p>

<p>"This may answer your question, Nellie." he said. He removed the
card and held it so that she could read it. The message was written
in indelible ink in a bold and striking longhand:</p>

<p class="letter">To the Avenger:<br>
Here is your friend, Crawford, with my compliments. He signed his
death warrant when he sent for you. Will you take a bit of advice,
Mr. Avenger? Go home. Go back at once, and forget what Crawford
told you. Otherwise, I shall wipe you out&mdash;and all those
associated with you in Justice, Inc. Believe me, Mr. Richard Benson
alias The Avenger, I can destroy you as easily as I destroyed
Crawford.</p>

<p>There was no signature to the note. But attached to the card by
its stem, just below the message, there was a single dwarf tulip.
It had just begun to open. Its petals were of the deepest black,
flecked here and there with blobs of red, which resembled nothing
so much as drops of blood.</p>

<p>Somehow, though the flower was in itself satanically beautiful,
its appearance afforded no sensation of pleasure, but rather one of
horror. For no tulip had ever been grown so small, or with black
leaves.</p>

<p>Some monstrous horticulturist must have taken a keen and evil
joy in thus producing a horrid perversion of nature; perhaps the
same kind of twisted mind which had devised the hellish scheme of
sending Crawford hurtling to his death in a strait jacket.</p>

<p>Nellie Gray stared wide-eyed at the strange and startling flower
which comprised the only signature to the note.</p>

<p>"The Black Tulip!" she said in a low, tense voice.</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="chapB2" name="chapB2">2. THE COFFINS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IN the squalor of one of New York's few remaining
slums a truck moved through the night. Of itself the vehicle was
not worthy of a second glance, for it was merely a truck with
slatted sides.</p>

<p>But its freight consisted of seven coffins.</p>

<p>The lettering on the side said:</p>

<p class="sign">BRODERICK CASKET CO.</p>

<p>The business of the Broderick Casket Co. was ostensibly the sale
and delivery of coffins to undertakers.</p>

<p>The truck moved quietly through the streets, and if people
noticed it at all it was to comment on its depressing cargo.</p>

<p>But as the truck swung into Pelham Street, a girl of about
eleven, with long black braids, ran out into the street after a
small mongrel dog.</p>

<p>"Come back, Tony!" she cried.</p>

<p>Tony was a brown mongrel, a little more than a year old, and
quite playful. He wanted the girl to chase him, and he yelped and
ran in front of the truck.</p>

<p>There was room for the truck to swerve if the driver had wanted
to make a sudden twist of the wheel. But he only muttered a curse
and let the heavy wheels roll over the little dog's body.</p>

<p>It seemed that he took a certain amount of satisfaction in doing
that. But when he stopped the truck and descended he managed to so
control his expression that nothing of the sadistic pleasure showed
in his face. He spread his hands as he spoke to the small crowd
which had gathered there over the dog's broken carcass.</p>

<p>"You see how it is," he explained. "The dog ran right in front
of me. It's a good thing the girl didn't follow him."</p>

<p>"That's right," someone said. "It wasn't the driver's fault.
Look at that heavy truck, loaded with coffins. How could he have
stopped?"</p>

<p>But the little girl with the long black braids was weeping
unrestrainedly.</p>

<p>"You could have swung out!" she cried through her tears. "You
could have tried to miss him. You didn't even try!"</p>

<p>The driver shrugged and looked for sympathy to the crowd. "She
shouldn't be out playing with her dog this late, anyway. She should
be in bed. It wouldn't have happened if she had been asleep in bed
where she belongs."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the same woman who had spoken before. "That Emma
Puglese is always picking up stray dogs. She'll cause a real
accident with them yet. Go on home, Emma Puglese. Your mother
shouldn't let you out so late."</p>

<p>Emma Puglese wiped the tears from her eyes. "You're a bad man,"
she said to the truck driver. "You didn't have to kill my dog. You
did it on purpose. I'll find some way to get even. Yes, I
will!"</p>

<p>She cast a glance at the name on the truck, and then sat down on
the curb, covered her face with her hands, and gave way to
unrestrained sobs.</p>

<p>The driver, seeing that the sympathy of the crowd was veering to
the girl, dug into his pocket and drew out some money.</p>

<p>"Here, girl," he said. "Here's three dollars. Go buy yourself
another dog. It wasn't my fault, but I don't like that you should
cry."</p>

<p>Emma Puglese thrust the bills away. "I don't want your money.
You're a bad man. I won't touch your money!"</p>

<p>The driver shrugged, looked at the crowd as if to say, "What can
I do about it?" and climbed back into his truck after moving the
body of the dog over to the curb.</p>

<p>The crowd dispersed as he drove away, but Emma Puglese sat
there, sobbing, angry and hurt.</p>

<p>The truck with the seven coffins continued down Pelham Street
for a block, and then turned into Farr Street. It stopped before
the undertaking establishment of Sylvester Strake Son, Inc.</p>

<p>It was rather late for a delivery, but there was a light in the
undertaking parlor. And strangely enough, a man stood in front of
the door, who looked up and down the street, and nodded swiftly to
the driver of the truck.</p>

<p>The driver thereupon descended, and with the help of the man
from the doorway he removed one coffin from the load. Between them
they carried it inside.</p>

<p>Now an empty coffin does not require great exertion from two
strong men. Yet these two were sweating when they set the coffin
down on the floor.</p>

<p>The man who had been standing in the doorway glanced inquiringly
at the truck driver.</p>

<p>"Did you have any trouble, Lambertini?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lambertini. "It went off like clockwork. But I'm kind
of worried. The Avenger won't lay off just on account of what we
did to Crawford. It'll only make him tougher."</p>

<p>The other shrugged. "We can handle anything. The Avenger is only
a man. Better go down with your load and report to the boss. I'll
give you a hand with the coffin and then I'll take over the
truck."</p>

<p>He helped Lambertini move the coffin onto a low dolly, and they
rolled it into the back room, then onto a small elevator
platform.</p>

<p>Lambertini returned to the front, let the other man out, watched
him get into the truck and drive away, and then locked the door. He
closed the Venetian blinds over the windows and turned out the
lights. Then he went back into the rear, stepped onto the elevator
platform beside the coffin and pressed a button.</p>

<p>The platform descended to the basement.</p>

<p>The basement was no different from that of any other
undertaker's establishment, and a minute search would have revealed
nothing of a suspicious nature.</p>

<p>But Lambertini rolled the dolly off the platform, pushed it
across to the opposite wall and pressed a button.</p>

<p>Immediately, a portion of the wall began to swing slowly outward
on well-oiled hinges, revealing a long, narrow passage, dimly
lighted at the far end.</p>

<p>Lambertini pushed the coffin along to the far end, and the
opening in the basement wall swung shut behind him. As he
approached the far end another section of wall opened and he went
through with his load.</p>

<p>A strange new world was revealed. But it was a queer and
perverted world, as if some weird magician had rubbed Aladdin's
magic lamp the wrong way.</p>

<p>The subterranean chamber was low-ceilinged and damp, but it was
huge in expanse. At the left there was a long row of glassed-in
rooms, in which men and women sat and worked at typewriters, radio
sending and receiving sets, and teletype machines. There were other
offices in which women filed papers and operated multigraph
machines.</p>

<p>In all there must have been fifty or sixty people working down
here underneath the surface of the city. It might have been a busy
newspaper office from the speed and efficiency with which everybody
was working.</p>

<p>But on the left-hand side of the chamber was the truly amazing
spectacle. For here a space perhaps twenty feet wide and fifty feet
long had been set apart and fenced off with a neat white picket
fence and made into a garden!</p>

<p>It was as weird and ghastly a garden as anyone might have
dreamed of in a tortured nightmare. It consisted of neat rows of
dwarf tulips, all black, and flecked with blobs of red.</p>

<p>They stood in ranks, like miniature soldiers of
Satan&mdash;abnormally small, yet pregnant with a horrid sort of
evil.</p>

<p>How those tulips could have grown at all in that underground
cavern was impossible to tell.</p>

<p>Lambertini trundled the coffin along a cement walk between the
glassed-in offices and the tulip bed. And a man arose from among
the tulips to meet him.</p>

<p>The man had been stooping over one of the rows, weeding it
carefully. But now, as he arose, it became evident that he was as
abnormal as the outlandish bulbs he was cultivating.</p>

<p>His torso was huge, his shoulders broad and powerful. His arms
were longer than average. But his legs were so short that he looked
like a dwarf. His head was large and entirely bald, and a pair of
cruel, clever eyes peered out from under thin and stringy
eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Well, Lambertini?" he asked.</p>

<p>Lambertini stood stiffly, as if he were at attention. "Orders
executed, colonel," he said. "Mission successful."</p>

<p>The tulip man nodded. "Follow me."</p>

<p>He turned and led the way along the cement path, along the row
of glassed-in offices, never looking to the right or the left.
Lambertini followed, pushing the dolly along.</p>

<p>At the rear of the low-ceilinged chamber the tulip man pressed a
button and a section of the wall swung open, revealing a private
office.</p>

<p>They entered and the door closed silently behind them.</p>

<p>On one wall of this office there was a rack of automatic
pistols. Below it was a rack of .38-caliber revolvers, all
carefully oiled, shining and bright. And on the floor there were a
dozen wooden cases. One of these cases was open, revealing the
contents. They were packages of ammunition for the weapons.</p>

<p>There were no windows in the room, but&mdash;as in the outer
chamber&mdash;the air was not stale. On the wall behind the desk
there was a large picture of Adolf Hitler, flanked by two swastika
banners. Other than that the room contained no decoration except
for a single black tulip in a glass on the desk.</p>

<p>The tulip man seated himself at the desk. He motioned toward the
coffin.</p>

<p>"You have him in there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Colonel Strake," Lambertini said.</p>

<p>"Open it!"</p>

<p>Lambertini took a small screwdriver from his pocket and knelt
beside the coffin. He loosened four bolts at the corners and
removed the lid, which was perforated at intervals with air holes
to permit its occupant to breathe.</p>

<p>The man who lay in the coffin was incased in a strait jacket,
just as Crawford had been. In addition his feet were bound at the
ankles and he was gagged. He was unable to move but his eyes stared
upward in a terrible sort of fascination.</p>

<p>Lambertini reached down and cut the cords that held the
prisoner's ankles. Then he lifted him by the shoulders, helping him
to his feet. Roughly, he led the helpless man to a chair and pushed
him into it. He stepped around behind him and undid the gag.</p>

<p>The prisoner was about forty-five, with a thin and scholarly
face, a high forehead and wide-spaced blue eyes. He found it
difficult to sit in the chair, for his arms were wrapped around him
in the sleeves of the strait jacket, which was pulled cruelly
tight. He was able to breathe only in short, quick gasps.</p>

<p>The tulip man's great bald dome shone brightly under the
electric light as he smiled at the prisoner.</p>

<p>"My dear Forsythe! It is four months since we last met, is it
not?"</p>

<p>"Damn you'" Forsythe gasped, trying to breathe against the
constricting pressure of the strait jacket. "Damn you, Strake, you
won't get away with this!"</p>

<p>The bald-headed Strake continued to smile. "You're a fool,
Forsythe. Don't you know by this time that there is
nothing"&mdash;Strake's face suddenly congealed with a swift rush
of rage&mdash;"nothing, I tell you, that The Black Tulip can't get
away with!"</p>

<p>He sprang up from behind the desk and came around on his
absurdly short legs until he stood squarely in front of Forsythe,
"Four months ago I offered you half a million dollars for your
depth charge formula. I offered to smuggle you aboard a U-boat and
take you to Germany where you would have been rewarded even beyond
the money I offered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure," Forsythe said bitterly. "I'd have been rewarded in a
concentration camp!"</p>

<p>Strake proceeded as if Forsythe had not spoken. He shook a
finger in his prisoner's face. "But you saw fit to reject my offer.
You knew my power, however, so you arranged with the Intelligence
Service to go into hiding while you worked out the formula for the
Forsythe Down-draft Depth Charge. You went to live on Crawford's
estate and posed as his chauffeur. You set up a laboratory in the
garage, didn't you? And you thought that The Black Tulip would
never find you, eh?"</p>

<p>Forsythe's glance dropped before the intensity of passion in the
other's eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, Forsythe, we found you!"</p>

<p>"You'll never get away with this, Strake. Crawford saw your men
carry the coffin away to the truck. When he misses me he'll guess I
was in it&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped as Strake began to laugh softly.</p>

<p>"What...what are you laughing at?"</p>

<p>"I'm laughing, my dear Forsythe, at your stupidity. Did you
think we'd leave Crawford alive?"</p>

<p>"You...you've killed him?"</p>

<p>"Draw your own conclusions."</p>

<p>"Damn you!"</p>

<p>"Is that all you can say, Forsythe?"</p>

<p>"No, no! That's not all I can say. I tell you that it won't help
you to have killed Crawford. Admiral Miles of Naval Intelligence,
arranged with Crawford to let me live on his estate. They arranged
that Admiral Miles was to phone once a day. The admiral must have
phoned already. He'll know there's something wrong. They'll scour
the country. They'll not leave a stone unturned&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait, Forsythe. Don't be misled by false hope. I want you to
realize the full futility of your situation. Suppose you think
back. Who else besides Admiral Miles knew where you were and what
you were doing?"</p>

<p>Forsythe clamped his lips shut.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Strake. "You refuse to answer. Well, you needn't
worry. You needn't be afraid of giving me any information which
might help me. You see, I'm remarkably well informed. I happen to
know that Admiral Miles was the only man in Washington who knew of
the arrangement with Crawford. They kept it such a dark secret that
it wasn't even placed in the files."</p>

<p>"All right," said Forsythe. "Suppose you're right. Admiral Miles
must already have phoned&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wrong again, my dear sir. It may interest you to know that
Admiral Miles was killed in a seaplane crash today at five
o'clock!"</p>

<p>Forsythe's eyes bulged. "You...you're lying!"</p>

<p>Strake chuckled. He picked up a newspaper from the desk and held
it before the helpless man's eyes.</p>

<p>"Read!"</p>

<p>The headline stared back at Forsythe with the ineluctable surety
of doom:</p>

<p class="headline">FOUR DIE IN SEAPLANE CRASH!<br>
Admiral Miles, Head Of Naval Intelligence, Among Those Killed<br>
Crash Attributed To Sabotage.</p>

<p>Strake chuckled again.</p>

<p>"We made sure, Forsythe, that no one would remain alive who knew
about you and your invention. If the Forsythe Down-draft Depth
Charge should ever be perfected for the American Navy it would mean
that a destroyer could drop a canister of explosive over the side
which could detonate immediately, without danger to the destroyer
itself."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Forsythe. "We could wipe your damned
U-boats off the face of the seven seas in a month!"</p>

<p>"Exactly, my dear Forsythe. And it is just to prevent such a
contingency that we have sought you high and low for four months
and have at last found you. Do you think, Forsythe, that we will
allow anything&mdash;anything, I say I&mdash;to stand in the way of
our acquiring the secret of your depth charge?"</p>

<p>"You'll never get it out of me," said Forsythe.</p>

<p>Strake smiled. "Within twenty-four hours, my friend, you will be
begging to be allowed to tell your secret!"</p>

<p>He motioned to Lambertini. "When I leave," he ordered softly,
"tighten his strait jacket one notch. Continue to tighten it one
notch each hour for the rest of the night!"</p>

<p>Forsythe's face whitened as he heard the order.</p>

<p>"You're a devil!" he gasped.</p>

<p>Strake nodded his big, oversized bald head. His eyes were bright
and cruel. "You understand what will happen, don't you, Forsythe?
Each notch is about a quarter of an inch. By morning your strait
jacket will have been tightened by almost three inches. Your ribs
will be constricted to the edge of the breaking point. You will
barely have room to take enough breath into your body to support
life. Your heart will pump faster and faster, but not strongly
enough to propel the blood to your extremities. Your hands and feet
will become numb first. Then your legs and arms. You will be able
to watch yourself die by inches, so to speak. There will be a fiery
pressure in your chest. You will be fighting, every moment, for
breath."</p>

<p>He paused and smiled a terrible, twisted smile. "At nine o'clock
in the morning I will return and sit here at the desk, and watch
you fight for your life. It will be a losing fight, Forsythe.
Believe me, I know. I have sat here and watched many a man like
that. Not one has refused to talk. They have begged for one thing,
only&mdash;a quick death. You, too, will beg for that,
Forsythe!"</p>

<p>"Damn you." the inventor whispered. "Damn you down to the lowest
cellar of hell! You can't get away with this. Something will
happen. Something unforeseen. Something you've overlooked.
Something you didn't plan on. God won't let you get away with
it!"</p>

<p>Strake's cruel eyes flickered. It was almost as if he winced at
the mention of the Deity. Almost, in that fleeting instant, it
seemed to the bound and desperate prisoner that he was looking at
the Prince of Darkness himself&mdash;and that the name of God had
caused Satan to squirm.</p>

<p>But Strake turned away from him to the desk, hiding that look in
his face. He picked the black tulip out of the water glass and
raised it to his nostrils. He looked at the prisoner in the chair
and spoke slowly.</p>

<p>"They call me The Black Tulip, Forsythe. And they say that The
Black Tulip has never failed. It is true. And it is true because I
overlook nothing. Nothing unforeseen can happen, Forsythe. I have
planned well and I have taken everything into consideration. That
is why I always succeed. With me there is no such thing as the
unforeseen circumstance. You will beg to talk tomorrow. I have said
it. It is a certainty."</p>

<p>He turned and walked out of the room on his queer, ungainly
legs.</p>

<p>And Lambertini stepped behind Forsythe's chair, undid the laces,
and tightened the strait jacket one notch.</p>

<h2><a id="chapB3" name="chapB3">3. EMMA GETS HELP</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">EMMA PUGLESE didn't go home. She sat on the curb
after the crowd had melted away and she sobbed.</p>

<p>After a while she took out a handkerchief and dried her eyes.
She avoided looking at Tony's body because she was afraid that if
she did she'd begin to cry all over again, and she didn't want to
waste time crying now. She had made up her mind what she wanted to
do, and she meant to do it quickly.</p>

<p>She crossed Pelham Street, walked to the corner, and then
hurried three blocks west. When she came to Bleek Street she turned
left into the dead end and walked down until she came to the
building with the modest bronze plaque over the door:</p>

<p class="sign">JUSTICE, INC.</p>

<p>Resolutely, she pressed the button and waited.</p>

<p>She didn't know it, but a cunningly concealed television device
was transmitting a picture of her to a watcher inside.</p>

<p>After a moment or two the front door began to swing open
automatically, and Emma's eyes widened in wonder.</p>

<p>A voice said, "Come in, please."</p>

<p>It was a kindly voice, and though she couldn't see where it came
from, she entered.</p>

<p>The door closed behind her.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," the voice said. "We have a lot of gadgets
around that work automatically. It's just some tricks that we've
worked out. No one will hurt you."</p>

<p>"I know," said Emma, speaking to the empty air. "I know no one
will hurt me here. This is where The Avenger lives. I want to talk
to him."</p>

<p>"The Avenger isn't here right now, but maybe I can help you,"
the voice said with quiet amusement. "Are you in trouble?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. But something has happened that needs to be
avenged. That's why I came to The Avenger. I heard my daddy talk
about The Avenger, and I know he helps little people get even with
big people for bad things they do to them."</p>

<p>"Aha!" said the kindly voice. "And did a big person do a bad
thing to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he did. A man in a truck just ran over my dog."</p>

<p>The voice was full of regret. "I'm terribly sorry to hear that.
Did you love him a great deal?"</p>

<p>Emma's eyes filled with tears. "He could stand up and beg. And
he carried small bundles for me. We played every day when I came
home from school."</p>

<p>"Maybe we can get you another dog."</p>

<p>"That isn't what I came for," Emma said firmly. "I came because
the man ran my dog over on purpose and I think he should be
punished."</p>

<p>"Are you sure he did it on purpose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sure. I looked up at the driver just when the truck
came near Tony. I wanted to shout to the driver to look out. But
then I saw that man's face. It...it was terrible. He was enjoying
himself. Then I knew it was no use shouting. I knew he wanted to
kill things. I could see it in his face. So when he offered me
money I wouldn't take it."</p>

<p>"Well," said the voice, apparently impressed. "I'm sure The
Avenger will want to help you. Did you get the man's name?"</p>

<p>"I saw the name on the truck. It was the Broderick Casket
Co."</p>

<p>"And what is your name?"</p>

<p>"I'm Emma Puglese, and I live at 13 Pelham Street. There was no
address on the truck, but I can tell you where it was going. It was
going to Strake, the undertaker. It comes every night and delivers
coffins to Strake. Sometimes one, sometimes two. But I noticed that
the coffins on the bottom of the load are always the same. It's
just the two top coffins that are different."</p>

<p>"Now wait just a minute, Emma," the voice said, suddenly
serious. "Wait there. I'm coming down."</p>

<p>Emma waited, fidgeting, until a door suddenly opened almost
alongside her where she had not thought there was any door. A man
emerged and smiled down at her.</p>

<p>Emma gaped at him. She had never seen such a big man. Like some
great viking god he towered over her, but somehow she wasn't at all
afraid of him, for she saw the kindness written in his face.</p>

<p>"My name is Smith," he told her. "Algernon Smith. Smitty to you.
I'm one of The Avenger's assistants."</p>

<p>"I know about you," Emma said. "I heard daddy talk about you,
too. You're an electrician."</p>

<p>Smitty smiled. His reputation as an electrical engineer had
spread to the four corners of the globe. But he had preferred to
give up the emoluments of a career of research and invention for
the more precarious one of fighting against crime by the side of
Dick Benson.</p>

<p>"Now suppose you tell me about that truck with the coffins. Tell
me everything you can think of about it."</p>

<p>"That's all I know," Emma said. "Us kids used to follow it when
it went down the street, and we would watch them unload the
coffins. That's how we came to notice that the bottom ones were
always the same. We used to sneak up and make chalk marks on the
bottom coffins when the driver was inside. And then, a few days
later, when we'd want to do it again, we saw that the same chalk
marks were still on the bottom coffins. That meant they were the
same, didn't it?"</p>

<p>"It surely did," Smitty told her. "And I'm glad you came. I'm
going to look into it right away!"</p>

<p>"Will you go over and punish that bad man?"</p>

<p>Smitty put a hand on her head. It was a huge, powerful hand. But
its touch was as gentle as the breeze.</p>

<p>"I'll investigate him, Emma. And whatever is necessary shall be
done. Now come on I'll walk you back to Pelham Street. You go home
and I'll look up that undertaker!"</p>

<p>He raised his voice slightly, speaking to thin air, just as Emma
had done.</p>

<p>"Take over, will you, Cole?" he said.</p>

<p>"Now listen, Smitty," said the voice of Cole Wilson, from
somewhere in the building. "This is no time to, go gallivanting
after coffins. Dick will be here in twenty minutes. I just had him
on the short wave. He's completed his investigation up at
Crawford's estate and he hasn't found a thing. We're up against a
blank wall on this case and it might be better if you stick around.
Can't Emma wait till tomorrow to get her man punished?"</p>

<p>Smitty winked at Emma.</p>

<p>He spoke to Cole Wilson, who was another one of the brilliant
young men The Avenger had gathered around him.</p>

<p>"Now don't get excited, Cole. It won't take me but ten or
fifteen minutes to look this up. I'm intrigued by the coffins that
never get delivered. I just want to look around that undertaking
establishment. I'll be back before Dick and Nellie arrive."</p>

<p>"All right," Cole Wilson said. "I suppose you won't sleep
tonight if you don't look into it. I'm busy as the deuce, but I'll
take over for you."</p>

<p>Smitty grinned and took Emma's arm, and led her out into the
street. He stopped off with her and bought her a banana split with
three balls of ice cream, and he had one himself, too. Then he saw
her safely to her house on Pelham Street, and continued on around
the corner to Farr Street.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chapB4" name="chapB4">4. "I'VE NEVER DIED BEFORE."</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">SMITTY saw the undertaker's establishment halfway
down the block, but before going there he stepped into a drugstore
on the corner and consulted the telephone directory. He found that
the Broderick Casket Co. was located in Brooklyn. He dialed the
number and frowned when someone answered the phone. It was after
nine o'clock, long past business hours.</p>

<p>"Hello," he said. "Is this the Broderick Casket Co.?"</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"Well, I want to order a coffin."</p>

<p>"We're all out of coffins, mister. Shipped the last one
today."</p>

<p>"But how can I die without a coffin?" Smitty demanded.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" the man at the other end asked, suddenly
suspicious. "Have you ever done business with us before?"</p>

<p>"No," said Smitty. "You see, I've never died before!" And he
hung up.</p>

<p>Thoughtfully, he went out of the drugstore and walked down the
street toward the undertaking parlor.</p>

<p>There was a light in the store as he approached, but he couldn't
look in, for the Venetian blinds were drawn all the way down,
behind both the door and the plate-glass window.</p>

<p>Smitty approached the door and a man standing near it said,
"Were you looking for someone, mister?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Smitty. He glanced at the name on the window.
"I'm looking for Mr. Strake."</p>

<p>"What did you want to see him about?"</p>

<p>"About a coffin that was delivered today by the Broderick Casket
Co."</p>

<p>The man stiffened. One hand stole into his coat pocket.</p>

<p>"What about the coffin that was delivered today?"</p>

<p>"I thought I'd like to buy it. It was a pretty coffin. It might
be nice to be buried in."</p>

<p>The man grinned. "You getting ready to die?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so," Smitty said, looking at the bulge in the man's
pocket.</p>

<p>"Well, mister," said the man, "I'm sure Colonel Strake will be
glad to see you. Very glad."</p>

<p>He stepped up close to Smitty, and with his left hand he rang a
bell alongside the door. Almost at once the door was opened.</p>

<p>"Go right in!"</p>

<p>Smitty obeyed. As soon as he was inside the gunman stepped in,
too. The man who admitted them shut the door and locked it.</p>

<p>"Who's this, Otto?" he demanded of the gunman.</p>

<p>Otto grinned. "He's a customer. He's looking for a coffin to be
buried in, Carl. What do you think of that?"</p>

<p>Carl chuckled. "He has certainly come to the right place!"</p>

<p>"This way," said Otto, showing Smitty the suggestive bulge in
his pocket.</p>

<p>Smitty went in the direction indicated.</p>

<p>Otto did not take him through the secret door in the rear wall.
Instead he led him to a small office, which was apparently used for
making funeral arrangements. He pressed a button on the desk in a
peculiar manner. And then they waited, not speaking.</p>

<p>Perhaps four minutes later another door at the back of the
office was opened and Colonel Strake entered, shuffling on his
queer short legs. His shrewd, cruel eyes darted to the great bulk
of Smitty's figure and he sucked his breath in sharply. But he made
no comment.</p>

<p>He looked at the gunman and said, "What is it, Otto? Why did you
signal me?"</p>

<p>Otto jerked his head toward Smitty. "I found him snooping around
the front of the store. He was trying the door. Claims he wants to
buy a coffin."</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m," said Strake. "I think we can accommodate the
gentleman. I really think we can!"</p>

<p>He directed his sharp glance at Smitty. "Who are you, sir?"</p>

<p>Smitty grinned. "The name is Smith."</p>

<p>"&mdash;Ah, yes. You're the one who just phoned the Broderick
Casket Co."</p>

<p>Smitty became taut. The Broderick Casket Co. was in Brooklyn.
They must have called here the moment Smitty hung up. There was,
then, a very much stronger connection between the Broderick Casket
Co. and the Strake establishment than just the sale of coffins.</p>

<p>But his thoughts were interrupted as Strake began to talk
softly.</p>

<p>"I recognize you, Mr. Algernon Heathcote Smith. Once having seen
you it would be impossible to forget you. You are The Avenger's
assistant, are you not?"</p>

<p>"The Avenger?" Smitty repeated. "Who's he?"</p>

<p>Strake raised a hand. "Please, Mr. Smith. Let's skip the play
acting. You know very well who The Avenger is. Your presence in
front of this establishment can mean only one thing&mdash;that The
Avenger has found some clue directing his attention to us. Please
tell me what that clue is!"</p>

<p>Smitty's eyes became narrow. He had come here on a whim, an
impulse. He had been affected by Emma's story, and intrigued by the
idea of coffins on a truck which were never delivered. No thought
had entered his mind that this place might be connected with the
Crawford murder, which The Avenger was working on. But now he had
something to chew on.</p>

<p>He began to laugh. It was ironical that the killing of a little
dog and the hurt anger of a small girl should have led to the first
break in the Crawford case. The murder of Crawford and the
abduction of the chauffeur had been so carefully planned and well
executed that not a single clue had offered itself for The Avenger
to work on. Benson had told Smitty over the two-way radio only a
little while ago that he was up against a blank wall.</p>

<p>And now this!</p>

<p>Smitty didn't know it at the time, but Forsythe's prophetic
words were coming true with a vengeance. The unforeseen
circumstance which no man can plan for had upset Strake's careful
calculations.</p>

<p>But if Smitty was in ignorance of the main angles of this
mystery, Strake was no less mystified as to what sort of clue had
brought him here. And he was grimly determined that Smitty should
talk.</p>

<p>"I asked you," he repeated softly! "what was the clue which
turned your attention to me!"</p>

<p>Smitty grinned. He chanced a shot in the dark. "It was the black
tulip." he said.</p>

<p>"The Black Tulip!" Strake exclaimed. "How? How did that lead you
here?"</p>

<p>"The odor," said Smitty. "I followed the scent."</p>

<p>Strake smiled grimly. He pressed a button on the desk, and
before Smitty could move the room was suddenly filled with grim and
husky men. There were more than a dozen of them, streaming in from
three doors, all armed with short clubs and blackjacks, and they
swarmed over Smitty like a small avalanche.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chapB5" name="chapB5">5. WHAT HAPPENED TO SMITTY?</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IT was nine thirty when Dick Benson and Nellie
Gray got back to Justice, Inc. They had missed Emma Puglese by less
than twenty minutes.</p>

<p>"Smitty's gone on a wild-goose chase," Cole Wilson told them
glumly. "Something about a dead dog and a coffin that's being
delivered over and over again to the same place."</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m," said Benson. "Sounds intriguing. I don't blame him for
going out on it."</p>

<p>"But not at a time like this!" Nellie Gray said hotly. "He knows
we're up against one of the cleverest criminals of the century, and
that we have to concentrate all our energies on fighting The Black
Tulip. He has no right to go out on side issues!"</p>

<p>"That's what I say," Cole agreed. Then he added, "You have a
visitor, Dick. A man from Naval Intelligence. He just came a couple
of minutes ago, and I asked him to wait in Room One. He said it was
extremely important. His name is Lieutenant Commander
Anderson."</p>

<p>"I'll see him at once!" Benson exclaimed.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Commander Anderson was a quiet, soft-spoken man, who
looked anything but what he was. He showed Benson his credentials
and got down to business at once.</p>

<p>"As you know, Mr. Benson, Admiral Miles was killed in a plane
crash today. I was his chief assistant, and he had left in my
safe-keeping a packet of confidential papers in code, which he
considered too dangerous to be placed in the navy files. They were
papers relating to matters which he handled personally, and which
would be left at loose ends in the event of his death."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Benson. "Was there anything in those papers about
Crawford?"</p>

<p>Anderson nodded. "How did you guess?"</p>

<p>"Crawford mentioned something that led me to believe he had been
working with Admiral Miles."</p>

<p>"That is true. After decoding the papers, I learn that Stanton
Forsythe, the inventor, had almost succeeded in perfecting a depth
charge which would explode wholly downward, thus preventing injury
to the ship which dropped it."</p>

<p>"I see!" said Benson. "Such an invention would revolutionize
anti-submarine warfare!"</p>

<p>"Exactly. It would enable us to clear the seas of submarines
within a couple of months. But there was reason to believe that the
notorious spy&mdash;The Black Tulip&mdash;was seeking to get hold
of the secret principle behind the theory of the Forsythe
Down-draft Depth Charge. There was still several weeks of work to
be done on the plans of the invention, and Forsythe feared for his
life. Admiral Miles therefore arranged for Forsythe to go to work
for Crawford, ostensibly as a chauffeur. Crawford had a completely
equipped experimental laboratory in the back of his garage, and it
was the ideal arrangement for Forsythe."</p>

<p>"It was ideal," Nellie Gray broke in bitterly, "until The Black
Tulip discovered where he was!"</p>

<p>Commander Anderson nodded. "You're quite right, Miss Gray. The
reason I have flown in from Washington to see you, Mr. Benson, is
because in Admiral Miles' notes I find a reference to you. He says
that Crawford knows The Avenger well, and has said that if anything
arose in the nature of an emergency, he would call upon you."</p>

<p>"He did," said Benson. "But The Black Tulip was too clever and
too fast for him, as you know. Here"&mdash;he took from an envelope
the card with the tulip attached&mdash;"I kept this from the local
police. I didn't want them messing the case up."</p>

<p>"You did right, Mr. Benson," Commander Anderson said, studying
the card. "Do you know who The Black Tulip is?"</p>

<p>Benson nodded. "I think he's Pieter van der Heusen."</p>

<p>"Ah! You remember Van der Heusen, then?"</p>

<p>"I've studied the records minutely. I was quite interested in
the man. He was a clever spy."</p>

<p>"So clever that he escaped after the last war. He's back here
now, we're certain. But we haven't the faintest idea where he is,
or what name he's using."</p>

<p>Anderson paused and added emphatically, "We must find The Black
Tulip quickly, Benson&mdash;before he tortures the secret of the
Down-draft Depth Charge out of Forsythe!"</p>

<p>It was just then that Cole Wilson stepped into the room, looking
anxiously at his watch.</p>

<p>"I heard the conversation over the recording system," he said.
"I don't like to bother you at a time like this, Dick, but Smitty
hasn't come back. He said he'd return in twenty minutes, and you
know our rule&mdash;always make contact by phone or radio if unable
to keep an appointment."</p>

<p>"It means Smitty's in trouble!" Nellie exclaimed. Gone was her
former anger at him for having gone off on a tangent. Now she was
full of concern. "He must be killed or captured&mdash;otherwise,
he'd have phoned!"</p>

<p>"Evidently he's run into something bigger than he expected,"
Benson said. He glanced at Cole Wilson. "Where did he go?"</p>

<p>Wilson went out and came hack in a moment with a cylindrical
record. Every conversation that took place with a visitor to
Justice, Inc. was automatically recorded for future reference. Now,
Wilson played the record back and they heard Emma Puglese telling
Smitty about the dog, and about the coffins, and that they were
usually delivered to Strake's.</p>

<p>When the record was finished. Benson's lips were tight. He
glanced at Lieutenant Commander Anderson. "Will you do me the honor
to use this place as your headquarters while working on the
Forsythe case? We'll co-operate with you to the fullest, of course.
But I must beg you to excuse me while I go look after Smitty."</p>

<p>It was one of the inviolable rules of Justice, Inc., that when
one member of the organization was in trouble or in danger, the
others would drop everything and pile in to his help. Otherwise,
the underworld would long ago have succeeded in whittling them
down, one by one. Each knew that in the event of peril he could
count on the others to fight through hell or high water to his
side. And this knowledge contributed greatly to the compact
efficiency of Justice, Inc.</p>

<p>And thus, ten minutes later, Dick Benson was walking slowly down
Farr Street, toward the undertaking parlor of Sylvester Strake.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chapB6" name="chapB6">6. THE BED OF TULIPS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BENSON paused at the door just as Smitty had done
before, and Otto, who was once more standing outside, stepped over
to him.</p>

<p>"You looking for some one, mister?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," Benson said mildly. "I'm looking for a rather big
man. I believe he came here a little while ago."</p>

<p>"Sure, mister," said Otto. "He's inside. We were sort of
expecting you to come looking for him." He put his hand in his coat
pocket and with his left hand he rang the bell.</p>

<p>The door was immediately opened by Carl.</p>

<p>"Go right in, mister," said Otto, showing Benson the bulge in
his coat. "It'll be a pleasure to entertain you!"</p>

<p>The one great mistake that Otto made was not to look behind him.
He had not, therefore, seen the long, sleek car which had crept
along the street in Benson's wake, nor had he seen the trim figure
of Nellie Gray descend and move toward them like some lissome
princess of fairyland&mdash;with this difference, that no fairy
princess ever carried a .32-caliber pistol!</p>

<p>Nellie pushed the muzzle of the pistol against Otto's spine.</p>

<p>"Don't forget me, young man," she said. "I'm in this party,
too!"</p>

<p>Otto stiffened. For a fraction of a second his attention was
pulled away from Benson.</p>

<p>That was all The Avenger needed. He gripped Otto's gun wrist in
fingers of steel, drew it out of his pocket without apparent
effort, and twisted his arm behind his back, all in one swift,
fluid motion.</p>

<p>Otto cried out at the pressure on his arm, and let go of the gun
he had been holding. Nellie Gray caught it as it fell.</p>

<p>Benson swung Otto around and gave him a stiff shove that sent
him stumbling through the open doorway, into Carl.</p>

<p>Then, before either of them could regain his balance, Benson and
Nellie stepped inside and Nellie closed the door. She leaned
against it, smiling winsomely, and covering both Carl and Otto, her
own pistol in her right hand, and Otto's in her left.</p>

<p>"And now, gentlemen," Dick Benson said mildly, "I'll thank you
to take me to where you're holding Mr. Algernon Smith!"</p>

<p>His eyes were cold and hard as he spoke. And he added softly, "I
hope&mdash;for your sakes&mdash;that he hasn't been harmed!"</p>

<p>"To hell with you!" growled Otto.</p>

<p>Benson sighed. He stepped in with a motion so fast that Otto did
not know what was happening until both his wrists were twisted
behind him.</p>

<p>Benson gripped both of those wrists in one hand, and though Otto
struggled and fought, he was powerless to break that hold.</p>

<p>With his left thumb, Benson pressed against a certain point
under Otto's armpit. He increased the pressure, and Otto uttered an
involuntary cry of pain.</p>

<p>He tried to squirm away, but the pressure increased inexorably.
The gunman tried to scream, but the sound died in his throat and
changed to a moan of agony as Benson dug his thumb deep into that
spot. Sweat sprang out on Otto's face and on the back of his neck.
The pain was so sharp and so intense that he could barely catch his
breath.</p>

<p>Benson's face was grim and hard.</p>

<p>"My friend's life is in the balance," he said tightly. "Do you
think The Avenger fights with kid gloves when his friends' lives
are in danger? Talk fast or I'll increase the pressure till you die
of the agony!"</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop!" Otto gasped, his face running with
perspiration.</p>

<p>Benson nodded grimly and relaxed the pressure a bit.</p>

<p>"Talk!"</p>

<p>"Smith...is down...below. The headquarters...of...The Black
Tulip&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nellie uttered an exclamation. Benson's eyes glittered.</p>

<p>"Show me!"</p>

<p>"This...way&mdash;"</p>

<p>Otto nodded his head feebly toward the wall at the rear.</p>

<p>Benson spoke swiftly to Nellie over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Smitty must have blundered into something. We mustn't miss on
this. It means even more than Smitty's life!"</p>

<p>"Right, Dick!" she said. She kept Carl covered while Otto led
The Avenger to the secret door at the rear and pressed the
concealed button that opened it.</p>

<p>"What lies beyond here?" Benson demanded.</p>

<p>Otto was no longer defiant. All the fight had gone out of him.
He was pathetically eager to please, lest he be subjected to the
terrible agony of that pressure beneath his armpit.</p>

<p>"It's the headquarters of The Black Tulip," he said, the words
fairly spilling out of his mouth. "Down there, more than fifty
people work. They are the home-office organization. From here the
orders go out which direct the work of German spies all over the
United States. It's the heart of The Black Tulip's
organization!"</p>

<p>"All right," said Benson. He motioned for Otto to move back next
to Carl, where Nellie could cover him. From his pocket he took a
small box that resembled a snuff box. From the box he took a wad of
something that looked like cotton, about a quarter inch in
diameter, and put it in his mouth. Then he took two small glass
ampules from the box and returned the box to his pocket. He nodded
to Nellie and stepped through the secret doorway.</p>

<p>"Don't take any lead slugs when you're not looking, Dick!"
Nellie called after him. "And see if you can bring Smitty back all
in one piece!"</p>

<p>Benson didn't answer. But the smile upon his face was almost
that of an avenging angel as he strode down the length of the
corridor toward the secret door at the other end.</p>

<p>He pressed that button as Otto had directed, and stepped through
into that strange and hellish underground world which was ruled
over by the man who called himself The Black Tulip.</p>

<p>He saw the bed of tulips, flecked with blood-red blobs, and he
remembered the flower he had found upon the strait-jacketed body of
George Crawford, and his mouth tightened into a straight, thin
line. He saw the glassed-in booths where men and women worked all
day and all night to destroy America, and his eyes flickered with a
strange and unholy light.</p>

<p>At the rear, Dick Benson stopped before a door. He turned the
knob and stepped inside.</p>

<p>Swiftly, his eyes scanned the contents of the room, noted the
single tulip in the glass of water, the picture of Hitler on the
wall, the strait-jacketed figure of Stanton Forsythe, breathing
with difficulty against the tight-notched torture corset, and then,
on the floor, the bound figure of Algernon Heathcote Smith, face
cut and bruised, but grinning nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Hi, Smitty!" he said.</p>

<p>"Hi, Dick!" Smitty said through his cut lips. "They couldn't
find a strait-jacket big enough for me. What do you think of
that?"</p>

<p>Dick Benson glanced over to the desk where Strake sat, his big
bald head gleaming, his small, cruel eyes flickering with quick
doubt.</p>

<p>"Smitty wears a size 52, Colonel Strake," Benson said in a
conversational tone.</p>

<p>Lambertini was standing behind Forsythe's chair, getting ready
to tighten the strait jacket another notch, and the sweat was
standing out on the inventor's forehead.</p>

<p>Forsythe groaned. "Why did you have to come here, Avenger? Now
they'll get you, too!"</p>

<p>Strake arose from behind the desk.</p>

<p>"I see you are unarmed, Avenger," he said smoothly. "Have you
come to make terms with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Dick Benson said slowly. "I've come to make terms. I'll
accept unconditional surrender&mdash;nothing less!"</p>

<p>Strake smiled queerly and put his hand in the drawer of the
desk.</p>

<p>"It would seem," he said slowly, "that I am the one to make the
terms&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's where you're wrong!" Benson said.</p>

<p>He flipped one of the glass ampules over on the desk. It fell on
the glass top and broke. At the same time he flipped the other
ampule over toward Lambertini. It struck the back of Forsythe's
chair and broke there.</p>

<p>The effect of those two glass ampules was startling, to say the
least.</p>

<p>They contained a highly concentrated ether compound which had
been developed by Fergus MacMurtrie, the chemical wizard who worked
for The Avenger. The properties of this secret&mdash;formula ether
compound were such that unconsciousness could be induced by one cc.
in a hundred thousand cubic meters of free air within a period of
one half second.</p>

<p>MacMurtrie had developed the ether compound for the United
States Secret Service, and Dick Benson was, perhaps, the only
person in civilian life who had access to it, for he had lent
MacMurtrie's services to the army for this purpose.</p>

<p>Sylvester Strake fell over on the desk in the act of reaching
for the gun in the drawer. Lambertini just folded up and lay down
to sleep on the floor against Forsythe's chair.</p>

<p>Benson himself was chewing upon the wad of cotton, impregnated
with a special solution which made him immune to the effects of the
drug by energizing certain salivary glands in his mouth. But Smitty
and Forsythe enjoyed no such immunity, and they went out like a
light, just as fast as Strake and Lambertini. Benson smiled grimly.
He crossed to the desk and picked up the phone.</p>

<p>A switchboard operator somewhere in the building said. "Yes,
Colonel Strake?"</p>

<p>"Give me Liberty 1-1111," Benson said, mumbling his words so
that the operator should not recognize that it was not Colonel
Strake.</p>

<p>Liberty 1-1111 was the number of Justice, Inc. In a moment, Cole
Wilson answered.</p>

<p>Swiftly, Benson switched from English to Hindustani. That, he
was sure, was a language which The Black Tulip's switchboard
operator would not understand, even if she were listening in.</p>

<p>Concisely, he told Cole Wilson what had happened, and instructed
him to inform Commander Anderson.</p>

<p>"Have Anderson raid this place at once," he ordered. "I'll break
a master capsule outside in the main room and that will render them
all unconscious&mdash;sort of set them all in Anderson's lap when
he comes with the raiding squad. We don't want to give them a
chance to destroy a single paper!"</p>

<p>Cole Wilson acknowledged the orders, still speaking in
Hindustani, which he had learned during his five years as a
surveyor for the British government in India. He rang off, and
Benson opened his snuff box again, and took from it a large glass
ampule, about the size of a four-ounce bottle. There was enough
concentrated anaesthetic in there to render a whole town
unconscious. He opened the door of the office, stepped out and
hurled the capsule out onto the concrete walk. Then he stepped back
inside, confident that MacMurtrie's solution would do its work
well. He had instructed Cole Wilson to prepare wads of cotton
saturated with the antidote, for the use of Commander Anderson's
raiding squad, so that they would not succumb to the fumes.</p>

<p>Smiling a little, he set about the task of releasing the
unconscious Forsythe from the strait jacket, and of untying
Smitty's bonds.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the raid was complete, affording the
Intelligence Service the greatest haul of spies since the beginning
of the war, and including the spy master himself&mdash;Pieter van
der Heusen, known as The Black Tulip.</p>

<p>Smitty was sitting up, half groggy, and rubbing his eyes. He
looked up to see Benson and Nellie watching him amusedly.</p>

<p>"Wake up, big boy," said Nellie. "You done noble&mdash;even if
you didn't know what you were doing. Justice, Inc. is going to give
you a wooden medal!"</p>

<p>"Gosh!" exclaimed Smitty, suddenly coming to his full senses. He
began to scramble up to his feet.</p>

<p>"Take it easy, big boy," said Nellie. "What's your hurry? You
haven't any place to go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's what you think, beautiful!" Smitty told her with a grin.
"I hope to tell you I have some place to go!"</p>

<p>"But where&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To see my girl friend!"</p>

<p>"Girl friend!" Nellie exclaimed with a sudden tinge of jealousy.
"Since when&mdash;"</p>

<p>Smitty grinned. "Her name is Emma Puglese, and she's ten years
old, and I have to go and tell her that the bad man who killed her
dog is being punished!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Nellie Gray.</p>

<h2><a id="chapC1" name="chapC1">1. THE PHONE BOOTH</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DICK BENSON emerged from the gloomy train platform
into the comparative brightness of the Deerchester station. Before
he had taken half a dozen steps along with the rest of the
thronging passengers, he heard his name being paged by a Western
Union messenger girl.</p>

<p>"Mr. Benson!" the girl was calling in a high-pitched voice.
"Telegram for Mr. Richard Benson!"</p>

<p>She was standing just outside the platform where the passengers
from the New York train were emerging.</p>

<p>Benson's eyes narrowed. He did not at once respond. Instead, he
glanced swiftly around the station. He noted that two men were
standing a little way from the platform gate, near one of the soft
drink stands, and that though they held glasses of orange juice in
their hands, they were not drinking, but were eying the incoming
passengers like hawks poised for the kill.</p>

<p>Benson's face remained expressionless. He moved around in such a
way that he could see those two men and approached the messenger
girl.</p>

<p>"I'm Benson," he said.</p>

<p>The girl smiled and gave him a yellow envelope. It was addressed
to: "Mr. Richard Benson, arriving Deerchester, six eighteen from
New York."</p>

<p>"Sign here, please," said the girl.</p>

<p>He signed for the telegram, gave the girl a tip, and waited for
her to go away. Then he opened the envelope.</p>

<p>The telegram said:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">SUGGEST YOU TAKE NEXT TRAIN BACK. THE AVENGER
MAY BE A BIG SHOT IN NEW YORK BUT HE'S A BAD INSURANCE RISK IN
DEERCHESTER. JUNIUS JONES.</p>
<br>

<p>Benson folded the telegram carefully and put it in his pocket.
Then he headed across the broad expanse of the station toward the
telephone booths. He entered one of the booths, inserted a nickel
and spun the dial half a dozen times at random as if he were
calling a number. He did this with his right hand, holding the
telephone receiver against his ear by resting it on his shoulder.
In this way he kept his left hand free. With this hand he dipped
into his coat pocket and produced a small automatic pistol and
snicked off the safety catch. He had left the door of the booth
open so that the light did not go on. Therefore the barrel of the
gun did not glint as he held it close against his stomach, pointing
outward.</p>

<p>He turned his head slightly and saw the two men who had been
watching him. They had left the orange juice counter and were now
close to the phone booth. The nearest one was holding something
wrapped in a handkerchief in his right hand, while the other was
standing behind him in such a way as to shield his companion's
actions from anyone who might be passing.</p>

<p>The fellow with the handkerchief-wrapped object moved up so that
he was squarely in front of the open booth door. His face was grim
and murderous as he thrust the object forward into the booth
against Benson's side.</p>

<p>"Take it now, Avenger!" he grated. "Regards from Junius
Jones&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice was punctuated by the spiteful bark of Benson's
automatic. The little gun kicked ever so slightly as Benson pulled
the trigger, and a slug smashed into the killer's chest, just above
the heart.</p>

<p>At the same time Benson's right arm came down in a sweeping
swing that knocked the handkerchief-wrapped gun aside. That was
unnecessary, however, for the other's gun did not even explode by
reflex action. The man was dead on his feet. His eyes snapped wide
open like those of a china sleeping-doll when one sits it up. He
swung slowly around against the adjoining booth and then slid down
to the floor.</p>

<p>Deftly, Benson flipped the automatic out of the booth and it
went slithering along the tiles. Almost in the same motion he
kicked the door of the phone booth shut.</p>

<p>The single shot, though not very loud, had attracted plenty of
attention from the passing crowd. Heads swung around and people
stopped abruptly at sight of the dead man and the sliding gun. The
dead man's companion, his face contorted with surprise and
mystification, turned to run.</p>

<p>Benson yanked open the door of the phone booth.</p>

<p>"Get that man!" he shouted, pointing at the fleeing man's
back.</p>

<p>A cry of anger went up from the crowd and half a dozen men threw
themselves upon the fugitive, carrying him down to the floor. A
railroad guard came running up from one direction and a uniformed
patrolman from the other. They lit into the crowd and collared the
captive, dragging him to his feet.</p>

<p>"He shot the man!" someone exclaimed indignantly, pointing to
the slumped body against the phone booth. "Killed him in cold
blood!"</p>

<p>"And then he threw the gun away and started to run!" another
added.</p>

<p>"Hah!" said the uniformed cop, shaking the captive like a rat.
"London Louis." He glanced across at the body of the dead man and
his lips curled in contempt. "And that's Benny Slocum, the guy
you've been palling around with. Why, you rat!"</p>

<p>"No, no!" shrieked London Louis. "I didn't do it! I swear I
didn't kill him. The Avenger killed him. I tell you it was The
Avenger! He's in there&mdash;"</p>

<p>London Louis' eyes widened as his finger pointed toward the
empty telephone booth, out of which Benson had slipped in the
confusion.</p>

<p>The cop laughed unsympathetically. "The Avenger, eh? A likely
story. What would The Avenger be doing in Deerchester? He's in New
York&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell you it was The Avenger&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell it to the Judge!" Deftly the cop snapped handcuffs on him.
"This time, you rat, you'll fry. You can't squirm out of this
murder!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chapC2" name="chapC2">2. "IN ONE HOUR!"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">OUTSIDE the railroad station, Dick Benson was
moving serenely through the crowded street without looking back
even once. To look at him no one would have thought that he was The
Avenger&mdash;for whose body on a slab in the morgue the overlords
of the underworld would have paid a fabulous reward. For he was the
one instrument of justice which they feared more than the law. It
was he who meted out unofficial punishment to those criminals who
considered themselves above the law. He was bound neither by the
entangling strands of red tape nor by the intricate trickery of
clever lawyers.</p>

<p>Whenever The Avenger appeared, the overlords of the criminal
underworld got the jitters. That was why this desperate attack had
been made upon him tonight.</p>

<p>But as he made his way up Broad Street from the railroad
station, he was not as serene and composed as he outwardly
appeared. The attack at the station meant much more than a mere
attempt upon his life. Two days ago, Nellie Gray and Algy Smith had
come here to Deerchester upon a mission that had seemed of minor
importance.</p>

<p>But since then there had been no single word from them. It
seemed that they had been swallowed up by the maw of the great
unknown.</p>

<p>Petite, demure, golden-haired Nellie Gray, and big, powerful
Smitty were the right and left hands of The Avenger. Himself a
veteran crimefighter, he had taught them much of what he knew. They
were capable, clever, shrewd campaigners and dangerous fighters. It
could be no ordinary antagonist who had brought about their
disappearance.</p>

<p>In the organization known as Justice, Inc., of which The Avenger
was the head, there was a standing rule that all members operating
in the field must report in by telephone, telegraph, cable, radio,
or any other means at their command at regular intervals. Failure
to make such regular report could mean only one of two
things&mdash;death or capture.</p>

<p>It was for this reason that Benson had boarded the first train
for Deerchester&mdash;only to find that the enemy had anticipated
his arrival and arranged a lethal reception that had missed its
goal by a small margin.</p>

<p>The name signed to that decoy telegram meant a good deal to
Benson. Ten years ago he had held this Junius Jones at the point of
a gun with his finger grimly ready to pull the trigger. That man,
known as Junius Jones, had groveled for his miserable life and
though his life was forfeit. Benson had spared it. He had let the
man go, knowing full well that Junius Jones would never forget that
moment of abject pleading&mdash;and would someday return to wipe
off the score.</p>

<p>Here then was the day of reckoning that Junius Jones must have
planned for with careful diligence and cunning.</p>

<p>Two blocks from the railroad station, Broad Street was
intersected by Main Street. Benson turned west and stopped before a
small store which was only dimly illuminated from within, with no
lights in the windows. The lettering on the plate-glass window
said:</p>
<br>

<p class="sign">DOBERMANN &mdash; ANTIQUES</p>
<br>

<p>In the window was an old, high-backed Empire chair. Flanking the
chair on either side were two small easels, upon which were
displayed twin miniature, gilt-framed oil paintings, also of the
Empire period.</p>

<p>But it was not at these that Benson glanced. His eyes were fixed
upon the one incongruous thing in the window display&mdash;a modern
book, which stood open upon the seat of the chair. There were
rubber bands around the first and second portions of the book, in
such a way that it remained open at page 276, which was facing
outward. The name of the book, which Benson discerned by peering
around at the opposite page, was <i>Main Street</i>.</p>

<p>It was strange indeed that the proprietor of Dobermann's Antique
Store should have chosen to embellish his display of antique period
furniture with a copy of a book written and published in the
twentieth century. But if anyone's curiosity had been aroused to
the point of making inquiries he would have found it impossible to
do so for the store was closed.</p>

<p>But The Avenger, it seemed, had no desire to make any inquiries
at all. In fact, he hardly stopped in front of the window display
for long enough to make his interest noticeable. Yet when he moved
on there was a certain grim purpose in his aspect that had not been
there before. And if he had been on guard before he was doubly so
now.</p>

<p>He was not taken by surprise, therefore, when the car pulled up
alongside the curb, pacing him as he walked swiftly up Main Street.
He stopped abruptly in midstride and swung around, facing the car.
His right hand was in his coat pocket gripping something bulky
there, and his eyes were twin pinpoints of fire as they lanced into
the interior of that car.</p>

<p>The driver was apparently paying no attention to Benson for his
hands were on the wheel and he was staring straight ahead as he
tooled the car forward at a snail's pace. Within the automobile the
face of a man was discernible, leaning forward at the window. The
window was closed almost up to the top, leaving only a crack
open.</p>

<p>The moment Benson spotted that white face in the window he
became taut, his features hardening into stern and uncompromising
lines. He stood facing the car, regardless of the occasional
passersby in the street. With his hand still gripping the gun in
his pocket he stepped closer to the car. The face inside became
clearer: the pinched nose; the lips, almost too red to belong to a
man, twisted in a smile, the small, quick, malicious eyes which
were filled with a glittering light of hatred; and the bald and
gleaming head which shone like a polished stone in the gloomy light
of the dimmed-out street.</p>

<p>"We meet again, Avenger!" said the man. "We meet again after ten
years. Do you remember the last time we met?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Benson. "I remember it very well, Junius Jones. I
had a gun on you that time. And now, too."</p>

<p>Junius Jones laughed softly. "Ah, yes. I see that thing in your
pocket. But this time I shan't beg for my life. This time I'm
sitting in a bulletproof car, behind bulletproof glass. This time
you're the one who'll do the begging!"</p>

<p>"For my life?" The Avenger asked scornfully.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. But for the lives of your friends. Will you beg
for their lives, Avenger? I can kill them any time I want to. How
would you like that, Avenger? Think of that big ox, Smitty. And the
beautiful girl, Nellie Gray. Would you like to see them alive and
breathing again? Then beg!"</p>

<p>"You lie!" said Benson.</p>

<p>The face of the other became twisted with rage. "I hold them
prisoner, I tell you! I can kill them in five minutes!"</p>

<p>"Prove it!"</p>

<p>"If I prove it what'll you pay for their lives?"</p>

<p>"Any price you name."</p>

<p>"Even your own life?" Junius Jones' eyes were glittering as he
asked that question with indecent eagerness. "Will you give up even
your life for theirs?"</p>

<p>"Even that," The Avenger said evenly.</p>

<p><br>
"AH!" The other's breath was exhaled in a long deep sigh. "I would
like that. I would like to see you put your own gun in your mouth
and pull the trigger!"</p>

<p>"Show me your proof," said Benson. "Prove to me that Nellie Gray
and Smitty are in your hands."</p>

<p>"You shall have the proof in an hour, Avenger!"</p>

<p>Benson smiled grimly. A load seemed suddenly to have been
removed from his mind. "In an hour? Then you're bluffing, Jones!
You haven't got them yet. You're going to try to get them!"</p>

<p>"What of it? You're helpless. You don't know where to go first,
or where to look for them. You've had no word from them for two
days. You haven't spoken to anyone since you got here. You haven't
the slightest clue to work on and you don't dare to go to the
police!"</p>

<p>The Avenger's eyes flickered. "Nevertheless, I've had a message
from them."</p>

<p>"You're mad. It can't be. I've played my hand too carefully. For
ten years I've planned this; planned and studied every move. It's
like a game that I've played a thousand times. I know it by heart.
I knew you'd come to Deerchester if Toby Dobermann got in trouble.
So I framed him for a murder and I even fixed it up in New York, so
you'd have to send your friends instead of coming yourself."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Benson. "I see!"</p>

<p>"And when your friends came," Jones hurried on, "I fixed it so
they'd find a clue to the real murderer. I led them on a chase into
the trap I'd prepared for them. Right now, Mr. Avenger, your
friends are barricaded in a certain place, with my men on the
outside. They've got their murderer. All they have to do is bring
him out of there and turn him over to the police, and they'll clear
Toby Dobermann. But," his pinched features became satanically
sardonic "but they'll never get out of that place alive!"</p>

<p>Benson suddenly smiled. "Thanks, Jones. You've taken a load off
my mind. Now I know there's a fighting chance for Nellie and
Smitty!"</p>

<p>"Never believe it, Avenger! My men can storm that place and kill
them at will. I was only waiting for you to come. It's you I want,
Avenger. I've planned well, believe me. Those two who tried for you
at the railroad station just now were merely the first shock
troops. In a way I'm glad they failed. I'd much rather see you die
by your own hand!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure it would be a pleasure to you," said Benson.</p>

<p>"In an hour!" Jones barked through the window. "In an hour I'll
send you proof that I can kill your friends at will. Where will you
be?"</p>

<p>"At Toby Dobermann's," said Benson.</p>

<p>Jones smiled craftily. "You don't know where Toby Dobermann is
hiding out. You'll never find him, I know. I've had him watched
ever since he escaped. The police are searching everywhere for him.
When I'm ready, I'll have him killed, too. But you&mdash;you'll
never find him. Your friends had no chance to communicate with you.
They couldn't have told you where he went."</p>

<p>The Avenger smiled. He said nothing.</p>

<p>Junius Jones smiled, too&mdash;a vicious little smile, framed by
those red, almost womanish lips of his.</p>

<p>"In an hour, Avenger," he murmured. "I give you an hour to find
out you're beaten. When you give up, phone me. You'll find my name
in the phone book. I'll have the proof you want. And I'll ask for
your life!"</p>

<p>He spoke a word to his driver and the car moved away.</p>

<p><br>
BENSON made no attempt to follow it or to fire through the window
at that vindictive face. No slug could have pierced the protection
of that bulletproof glass.</p>

<p>As soon as the car was gone he resumed his course down Main
Street. In the next block he came abreast of No. 276.</p>

<p>No. 276 Main Street&mdash;the address indicated by the page
number and title of the book displayed in Dobermann's window, was
an unpretentious brownstone house with a high stoop. A modest sign
in the door announced:</p>
<br>

<p class="sign">FURNISHED ROOMS</p>
<br>

<p>Benson made no attempt to ascertain whether he was being
followed. He stopped before the house for just a moment, then
ascended the steps of the high stoop and rang the bell.</p>

<p>After a moment the door was opened by a dark-haired girl of
about twenty-two. Her face was drawn and tense, and there was a
pallor in her cheeks, which spoke of sleepless nights and long
vigils.</p>

<p>"Yes?" she said.</p>

<p>"You're Sally Dobermann? Toby's wife?"</p>

<p>Suddenly she seemed to congeal within herself. "I...you must be
mistaken&mdash;" she started to close the door. Benson made no
attempt to stop her physically. He only said, "I'm Benson."</p>

<p>Her eyes widened. "The...The Avenger?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She looked at him with doubt and suspicion struggling
perceptibly in her eyes. "Prove it!"</p>

<p>Benson smiled. "Nellie Gray and Smitty were here two days ago.
Before they left they told you I might come if anything happened to
them. They told you to set up the book in the window display at the
store&mdash;knowing that I'd go there first, and if it was closed
that I'd look for some message."</p>

<p>"And you found the message!"</p>

<p>"It was very easy. I'm surprised that Junius Jones didn't spot
it."</p>

<p>There was still a bit of doubt in her eyes. "How...how do I know
he didn't spot it? How do I know you're not one of his...his
killers?"</p>

<p>"Ask me anything you like. But do it quickly. Time is
short."</p>

<p>"All right. If you're really The Avenger you must have known
Toby's father."</p>

<p>"Yes. I knew him."</p>

<p>"His name?"</p>

<p>"Jan Dobermann. He was a South African. I met him in
Johannesburg many years before the war. He was a curio dealer.
There was a bandit out there in those days who went by the name of
Junius Jones. Jan Dobermann and I tracked him down and fought it
out with his gang and captured Jones. The mistake we made was in
sparing his life."</p>

<p>Sally Dobermann nodded. "All you say is true. But you haven't
told me anything that Junius Jones doesn't know as well. I must be
sure&mdash;absolutely sure&mdash;that you're The Avenger."</p>

<p>"When Jan Dobermann died," Benson said slowly, "I promised him
on his deathbed that I'd always be ready to help his son, Toby, in
trouble. Jan had two watches which he had brought with him from
South Africa. They were twin watches, eighteen-carat gold, and no
larger than a dime. He gave me one of them and the other to Toby.
Here's mine."</p>

<p>From his fob pocket he produced a little glistening golden watch
so small that there was no room for the numbers to be inscribed on
the face. They were indicated merely by dots.</p>

<p>The moment she saw that watch all doubt and suspicion vanished
from Sally's face.</p>

<p>"Come in, please," she said. "And thank God it's you. I...I
couldn't have stood it much longer!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chapC3" name="chapC3">3. ESCAPE.</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BENSON entered and Sally quickly closed the door.
They were in a narrow hallway with a sitting room opening off to
the left and a staircase up ahead.</p>

<p>"This is my aunt's home," Sally Dobermann explained
breathlessly. "My aunt converted it to a rooming house this Fall
when the airplane factory went on a twenty-four-hour schedule and
hired a lot of new night men. The tenants are on the late shift and
they won't be home till after midnight. For two days we've been
hiding Toby in the hall bedroom on the top floor, but the police
are sure to think of this place sooner or later. Junius Jones knows
about it. His men keep a constant watch."</p>

<p>She shuddered. "It...it's dreadful, seeing those men always
outside and knowing that they could give us away to the police any
time they want!"</p>

<p>"You needn't worry about that for another hour," Benson told her
quietly. "I've talked to Jones. He's given me an ultimatum. It
expires in a hour."</p>

<p>"How can you do anything in a hour? Your young lady with the
golden hair has disappeared, and so has that big tall man who came
with her. Junius Jones holds the whip hand. He's playing with Toby
and me like a cat with a pair of helpless mice. An hour is so
short&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then let's not waste a minute of it," Benson said.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry!" she exclaimed contritely and led the way up the
stairs. At the top floor she stopped before the door of the hall
bedroom at the front. Very gently she turned a key in the lock and
pushed the door open.</p>

<p>The room within was in darkness except for a feeble little
seven-watt blackout light which was plugged into a wall outlet in
the baseboard, close to the floor. It afforded just enough
illumination to discern the figure of Toby Dobermann, lying on a
mattress on the floor. His face was gaunt and unshaven, and
stricken with the pallor of one who is close to death. He lay on
his back with a thin blanket covering him from the hips down. There
was a bandage swathed tightly across his chest and another around
his right shoulder. Both of them were saturated with blood. The
wounded man turned his head at the sound of the opening door. He
looked at them out of deep-sunk, bloodshot eyes. He saw his wife
and croaked, "Sally&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then his glance jerked to Benson. A spasmodic twinge contorted
his features. He drew his left hand out from under the blanket. It
was gripping a square-cut, short-barreled automatic pistol. He
pointed it at Benson.</p>

<p>"Stand still!" he ordered hoarsely. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"It's all night, Toby!" Sally exclaimed swiftly. "It&mdash;it's
The Avenger!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Toby Dobermann. His whole body seemed to relax, as if
a terrific tension had been removed. He let his hand drop to the
floor and laid the automatic on the mattress.</p>

<p>Benson came and knelt beside him. He inspected the two
bandages.</p>

<p>"Sally had to fix them," Toby Dobermann said, speaking with
difficulty. "We didn't dare to call a doctor. I broke two ribs
jumping from the courthouse window, and a bullet caught me in the
shoulder just as I was turning the corner. But I managed to get
away..."</p>

<p>"They accused him of murdering one of his wealthy customers,"
Sally broke in hurriedly. "A Mr. Pelton. The police saw a light in
the back of the store one evening and tried the door and found it
open. Mr. Pelton's body was in the office at the rear. He'd been
shot at close range and it turned out that the gun that killed him
belonged to Toby. At the preliminary hearing, two men testified
that Toby and Mr. Pelton had had a violent quarrel that evening.
Both those men lied, of course. They're in the pay of Junius
Jones."</p>

<p><br>
BENSON nodded impatiently. "I know the facts. You were arraigned
the next morning. You had wired me for help and I had sent Nellie
Gray and Smitty, but when they got here you had already made your
escape. They contacted Sally and got some kind of clue and went to
follow it up."</p>

<p>"It was a trap," Toby Dobernann gasped. "Someone tipped them off
where to find the murderer. They went out on that tip and that's
the last we heard of them!"</p>

<p>Sally knelt beside Dick Benson and bent over to arrange her
husband's bandages, speaking quickly as she worked over them. "Miss
Gray was clever, though. She told me that you were out of New York
on some other matter, and she couldn't reach you because your
headquarters in New York, Justice, Inc., wasn't manned by anyone.
She couldn't get in touch with you to tell you where Toby was
hiding out, and she didn't dare to leave a message anywhere, so she
arranged to leave that book in the store window. She said you'd
understand."</p>

<p>Benson got to his feet and stood over the wounded man. His
thoughts were winging swiftly to that unknown spot where Nellie
Gray and Smitty were probably fighting for their lives at this very
moment. He had made a promise to this wounded man's father to help
him; but he also owed a duty to Nellie and Algy Smith. He must find
out where they had gone, where this trap was, into which they had
walked in search of a murderer. Never had any member of Justice,
Inc. needed the help of the others without receiving it. And this
one time&mdash;when their lives were in the balance&mdash;he must
not fail them. He had less than an hour now; minutes of precious
time in which he must trace their steps, follow the course they had
taken and reach their side. But, also, he must consider Toby
Dobermann, who lay here, wounded and helpless, at the mercy of
Junius Jones.</p>

<p>Something of the cruel problem which faced him must have been
communicated to Toby and his wife, for they watched him in silence,
as if awaiting his decision. Toby reached up a hand and said
impulsively, "Go after your friends, Avenger. Leave me here. The
chances are that I'll be all right. Junius Jones has left me alone
so far."</p>

<p>Benson smiled bitterly. "He left you alone, only because he
hoped I'd come looking for you. You were bait, by which he hoped to
snare me. Now that I've come he has nothing more to gain by leaving
you free. He may be notifying the police right now&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sally uttered a cry of despair. "We can't let Toby be arrested.
The police are being goaded on by the newspapers to obtain a
conviction. The district attorney is ambitious and ruthless.
They'll give Toby the third degree in spite of his wounds. Junius
Jones has tremendous power in the city, and he'll exert all his
influence to see to it that they force a confession out of
Toby&mdash;or else kill him in the process. Please&mdash;you can't
let them take Toby in!"</p>

<p>Benson looked down at the wounded man. "Can you walk?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;with a little help. I'd have to lean on someone."</p>

<p>Benson turned to Sally. "Is there a way out of this
house&mdash;besides the front door?"</p>

<p>She nodded swiftly. "There's a basement exit in the rear. And I
have a car in the back street. I...I had thought of getting Toby
out that way, but Junius Jones has a man watching in the
backyard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right," said Benson, making a swift decision. "We'll have
to chance it!"</p>

<p>Between them they helped Toby to his feet. Sally got a topcoat
and wrapped it around him. Then they helped him out of the room and
down the stairs.</p>

<p>Toby's face was drained of all color and he was grimly biting
his lip by the time they reached the main floor.</p>

<p>The cellar door was at the back of the stairs, and they worked
their way down, slowly and laboriously. There was no light down
here and they felt their way toward the back door. Benson put his
face close to the grimy glass and peered out into the night. He
caught the glow of a cigarette and discerned the figure of a man
standing in the yard, half a dozen feet from the door.</p>

<p>He heard the rasping breathing of Toby Dobermann at his side,
and the swiftly caught breath of Sally as she realized that if this
man gave the alarm the watchers out in front would come hurrying to
his assistance.</p>

<p><br>
"IT...it can't be done!" she gasped. "We need time. Toby can't run.
If you shoot that man the others will come and the fight will bring
the police&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait here!" Benson whispered. He inched the door open and
squeezed out into the yard.</p>

<p>The man on watch stiffened and his hand darted to his shoulder
bolster. It emerged, gripping a gun.</p>

<p>"Stand still&mdash;"</p>

<p>That was all the man got a chance to say, for Benson stepped in
swiftly, swinging downward with his left hand. He seized the man's
gun wrist, twisting sideways as he did so. His fingers clamped like
iron on the man's wrist while with his right hand he gripped the
gun barrel and bent it upward and back with his thumb under the
fellow's trigger finger so that he couldn't pull the trigger.</p>

<p>Benson thrust powerfully against the upraised barrel, still
retaining his grip upon the other's wrist with his left hand. In
this way the man's own gun became a fulcrum upon which his wrist
broke under Benson's inexorable pressure.</p>

<p>The snapping of the bone made a crunching, brittle sound, and
the man uttered a little moan and slumped down in a faint.</p>

<p>Swiftly, Benson caught him and dragged him into the cellar. He
laid him on the floor and picked up his gun. He straightened up to
see Toby Dobermann and his wife watching him with wide and
fascinated eyes.</p>

<p>"God!" said Toby Dobermann. "I never saw anything as neat as
that! I...I'm beginning to hope again. With you helping
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Benson thrust the gun into Toby's left hand. "Let's get
started&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the sudden harsh jangling of the doorbell
at the front of the house. It was followed almost immediately by a
loud, authoritative shout: "Open up in there! In the name of the
law!"</p>

<p>"The police!" gasped Sally. "Jones sent them. We haven't a
chance. There's nobody home now. The police will break the door
in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get going!" Benson ordered harshly. "I'll hold them!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's no time to argue. If you get Toby out of here, get in
the car and drive over to Broad Street and park at one of the
park-o-meters. Let Toby lie down in the bottom and cover him with a
robe. The police will never think of looking for him on Broad
Street. Wait there till you hear from me. If I don't come by
midnight start out and try to drive out of the state!"</p>

<p>"No, no!" Sally exclaimed. "We can't let you do it&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he didn't wait to hear her protests. He was already racing
up the cellar stairs, taking them three at a time. As he reached
the top he heard a fervent, "God bless you, Avenger!" And then he
was running down the hall toward the front door just as the
authoritative voice out there shouted, "All right, boys, we'll
break the door down!"</p>

<p>"Just a minute!" Benson shouted. "'Here I come!"</p>

<p>He reached the door and undid the lock. Then he yanked the door
open with his left hand, at the same time slipping his right hand
into his coat pocket.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chapC4" name="chapC4">4. "WHERE'S YOUR WARRANT?"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">A UNIFORMED policeman and a plainclothes detective
shouldered their way into the hall. Behind them, Benson caught a
glimpse of the thin, malicious face of Junius Jones. But Jones
refrained from entering.</p>

<p>Benson barred the way of the two police officers. "What do you
want here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The plainclothes detective exhibited a badge in the palm of his
hand. "Sergeant Fletcher, Headquarters Squad," he rasped. "We're
searching this house. We have reason to believe that Toby
Dobermann, wanted for murder, is hiding in here. Get out of our
way."</p>

<p>He tried to elbow his way past, but Benson effectually barred
his progress. "Do you mind showing me your search warrant,
sergeant?" he asked mildly.</p>

<p>"Search warrant!" Fletcher exploded. "We don't need any search
warrant. We're looking for a murderer&mdash;a fugitive from
justice. There's no search warrant needed in such a
case&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A warrant is unnecessary," Benson interrupted suavely, "only in
the event that a police officer has substantial information,
furnished by a reliable authority, which convinces him that a
fugitive from justice is in hiding, and may escape before a search
warrant can be issued."</p>

<p>Sergeant Fletcher's eyes narrowed. "Just who are you?" he
demanded. "Are you a lawyer?"</p>

<p>Benson smiled. "Not exactly."</p>

<p>"You seem to know a lot about the law."</p>

<p>That was all the man got a chance to say, for Benson stepped in
swiftly, swinging downward with his left hand.</p>

<p>"Enough to insist upon your observance of it."</p>

<p>"All right," said Fletcher. "If you want to be technical, I can
be technical, too. It so happens that I have substantial
information which convinces me that Toby Dobermann is hiding in
this house and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did Junius Jones give you that information?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I'm sorry, but it doesn't come from a reliable source. In
case you don't know it, Junius Jones has a record that stretches
all the way back to the Transvaal, Johannesburg and Cape Town."</p>

<p>"You're crazy!" said Fletcher. "Jones is the biggest insurance
broker in Deerchester. He couldn't have gotten a license if he had
a criminal record."</p>

<p>"His fingerprints aren't on record," Benson said calmly,
"because his gang raided the Cape Town Bureau of Criminal
Investigation ten years ago and destroyed the records."</p>

<p>Junius Jones thrust himself forward, his face livid with anger.
"It's a lie! A damned lie! Go ahead, sergeant. Don't let this man
stop you. He's only trying to bluff&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fletcher nodded. He motioned to the uniformed patrolman who drew
the revolver from the holster at his side. Then he said to Benson,
"Whoever you are, mister, I now order you to stand aside.
Otherwise, I'll arrest you for interfering with the police in the
course of making an arrest!"</p>

<p>Swiftly, Benson calculated that about five minutes had elapsed
since he had left Toby and Sally at the cellar door. He hoped that
they had made it to the car by this time.</p>

<p>"All right, sergeant," he said, shrugging resignedly. "If you
put it that way, I yield. But in the name of the owner of this
house, I reserve the right to bring an action against you
personally, and the city of Deerchester, for illegal entry. I warn
you that if you step into this house and search it, and then fail
to find Toby Dobermann here, you will have to face a court action
for fifty thousand dollars!"</p>

<p>He stepped aside and bowed. "Enter, sergeant&mdash;at your own
risk!"</p>

<p>Fletcher looked at him in puzzled fashion. He was manifestly
impressed by the threat of the heavy lawsuit. There had been many
instances in which over-zealous police officers had violated the
constitutional rights of private citizens and had thereafter been
compelled to pay large sums of money in damages, in addition to
losing their jobs.</p>

<p><br>
BUT it was Junius Jones who solved the problem for him.</p>

<p>"Go ahead, Fletcher," he urged. "I'll guarantee to pay any
judgment they get against you. And besides, I give you my personal
word that Toby Dobermann is in this house&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If he hasn't gotten away through the back door by this time!"
the uniformed policeman growled.</p>

<p>Junius Jones smiled twistedly. "I assure you he couldn't have
gotten away through the back. The minute I heard that Dobermann was
hiding here I put one of my own boys on guard at the rear, as well
as a couple to cover the front. Dobermann hasn't left this
house!"</p>

<p>"That's all I want to know!" Fletcher barked. He barged past
Benson, shouting over his shoulder, "All right, boys! Let's
go!"</p>

<p>Two more uniformed policemen shouldered in, following Fletcher,
and leaving the first patrolman on guard at the front door with his
revolver naked in his hand.</p>

<p>Benson watched them spread out over the ground floor and a
curious smile tugged at his lips. He turned around and found that
Junius Jones had not waited. He was gone.</p>

<p>Benson saw that the uniformed patrolman was watching him with a
frown.</p>

<p>"Well, officer," he said suavely, "now that everything is
settled I think I'll be running along, too&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nix!" growled the policeman, raising the revolver slightly.
"You stick right here, mister. I'm thinking the sergeant will have
plenty to say to you when he's through!"</p>

<p>Benson shrugged. He put a hand into his breast pocket. The cop
stiffened and thrust the revolver forward so that the muzzle was
only a few inches from Benson's side. But The Avenger brought his
hand out, containing nothing more dangerous than a sterling silver
cigarette case.</p>

<p>The cop grunted and lowered the revolver a bit. Benson smiled at
his discomfiture and offered him a cigarette, holding the case high
up in front of the officer.</p>

<p>"No, thanks!" the other growled.</p>

<p>Benson shrugged again and selected a cigarette for himself. He
snapped the case shut and reversed it. There was an ingenious
lighter built into the base, and Benson lit the cigarette, inhaling
deeply. He heard Fletcher and his men moving around on the floor,
banging closet doors and tramping from room to room. Then they came
out into the hall.</p>

<p>"You, MacAleer," Fletcher ordered one of the men, "take the
cellar. Keep your gun handy." He turned to the other. "You come
upstairs with me, Adams!"</p>

<p>He headed up the stairs with Adams in tow while MacAleer's heavy
tread sounded, descending the cellar stairs.</p>

<p>Benson tensed, waiting for MacAleer to discover the body of the
guard with the broken wrist.</p>

<p>From the upper landing Sergeant Fletcher looked down and spoke
to the patrolman at the door. "Hold that guy down there, Parsons.
Don't let him leave. We'll take him down to the station house with
us. There's a little unfinished business I got to take up with
him&mdash;sort of teach him a few fine points about the law!"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by an excited yell from the cellar. "Hey!
There's a guy down here!" MacAleer shouted.</p>

<p><br>
PARSONS tensed, swinging his eyes away from Benson for an instant.
It was the precise split second for which The Avenger had been
waiting and for which he was set. Almost as if his reflexes had
been connected to MacAleer's voice by an electric circuit, his
right fist shot upward in a short, terrific blow to Parsons'
jaw.</p>

<p>The smack, as bone thudded against bone, was like the cracking
of a huge pane of glass. Parsons rose up from his heels as if he
were standing on tiptoe and craning his neck to see something. Then
he teetered slowly forward. He bent first at the knees, then at the
waist, and tumbled slowly down to the floor like a double-jointed
acrobat about to do a somersault. Only he never completed the
somersault, for he remained where he fell, on his face, without
moving.</p>

<p>Benson rubbed his knuckles. He heard MacAleer still shouting
down below, and Fletcher's pounding feet from up above as he
hurried to answer the call.</p>

<p>But Benson didn't wait. He stepped lithely over Parsons, opened
the front door and made his exit.</p>

<p>A small crowd had gathered in the street and they stared at him
as he came down the stoop. They took him for one of the detectives
and made way for him. He heard a yell of fury from within, and knew
that Fletcher had reached the ground floor and discovered his
escape. He strode through the crowd to the police squad car that
was parked at the curb and stepped into it. A single swift glance
showed him the ignition key still the wheel and he put his foot on
the accelerator. The motor had been left running. He had expected
this, for it is a practice of police everywhere never to turn off
their engines so that they can make a quick start whenever
necessary.</p>

<p>He shifted into first, gave her gas, and pulled away fast. He
threw one last glance back at the house and saw the crowd
dispersing wildly in every direction as Sergeant Fletcher came
racing a deep purple, and yelling at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>Benson was about to duck his head low for the volley he knew
would come in a moment, but he saw Fletcher reach the
next-to-the-last step of the stoop and trip in his furious haste.
The last glimpse Benson had was of the sergeant sprawling at full
length on the sidewalk and his revolver slithering out into the
gutter.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chapC5" name="chapC5">5. THE TRAIL.</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BENSON made a right turn at the corner, then
another right turn at the very next corner. This brought him
heading back toward Broad Street. He drove two more blocks, pulled
in to the curb and abandoned the police car. He walked swiftly over
to Broad Street, his thoughts grim and bleak. True, he had
succeeded in getting Toby Dobermann out of danger temporarily. But
the most urgent task remained yet to be done: he must trace the
steps of Nellie Gray and Smitty, and find the place where they were
fighting for their lives.</p>

<p>They must surely be counting on him, he knew. Never in the past
had he failed them. If they went down to their death in battle they
would be convinced that he must be dead&mdash;otherwise he would
have gotten to them somehow.</p>

<p>So closely did those three work together that they could almost
read each other's thoughts. In any given situation, each of them
could predict accurately what the others would do. And Benson was
certain that neither Nellie nor Smitty would have gone off on the
trail of the murderer without leaving him some mark along the road
they had taken. When he had seen the copy of Main Street in
Dobermann's window he had recognized it at once as the kind of
trail marking that the members of Justice, Inc. liked to leave. He
had thought it would lead him to Nellie and Algy. But he knew now
that it led only to a dead end, for neither Toby Dobermann, nor his
wife, could give him the information he needed.</p>

<p>He was troubled&mdash;badly troubled&mdash;by the gnawing
thought that he had overlooked something along the line; some other
trail marking which they had left for him somewhere.</p>

<p>He turned into Broad Street and immediately spotted the car in
which Toby Dobermann had escaped from the rooming house. It was
parked in one of the park-o-meter spaces, and Sally was sitting at
the wheel, her face buried in a newspaper. But she was peeking out
of the corner of her eye and she saw Benson. She moved over to the
window as he came abreast of the car.</p>

<p>"This is a wonderful place to hide!" she said. "The police cars
keep passing us time and again, but they never even give us a
second glance!"</p>

<p>She nodded toward the rear of the car where a bundle under a
robe stirred impatiently. "It's tough on Toby, though. I'm afraid
his wounds will open again. We have to get him some medical
attention before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen to me," Benson cut in harshly. "I'm going to ask you a
question and I want you to think hard when you answer, because the
lives of my two dearest friends may depend upon it."</p>

<p>Sally looked up at him, wide-eyed. "I'm sorry, Mr. Benson. I...
I'd forgotten about them. I...I'll do my very best."'</p>

<p>"When Miss Gray arranged that display in the window, were you
with her?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes."</p>

<p>"Was it after they had received the tip about where to find
Pelton's murderer?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" Benson's eyes were glittering. "Now think
carefully&mdash;what was in the window display before Miss Gray
rearranged it?"</p>

<p>"Why, there were three Empire chairs. Miss Gray took out two of
the chairs, and sent me out to buy a copy of Main Street. When I
returned she had the two pictures on the easels, on either side of
the chair. They're very old pictures of London, you
know&mdash;-anonymous pictures that we picked up at an auction. I
told Miss Gray that they were Victorian and didn't go with the
Empire chair, but she waved me aside and finished the job in a
hurry because they had to get away and follow up on the tip."</p>

<p>Benson breathed a deep sigh. He opened the door of the car and
slid in beside Sally.</p>

<p>"Drive!" he ordered, "Past the store!"</p>

<p>"But...but that's on Main Street! They'll be looking for you
on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Drive!"</p>

<p><br>
THERE was that in his voice which made her swallow hard and clutch
the wheel. She started the car and in a moment they were around the
corner on Main Street. As they came abreast of the antique store
they could see a huge crowd gathered in front of the rooming house
down in the next block, with half a dozen squad cars in the middle
of the street.</p>

<p>"Stop here!" Benson ordered. He opened the door and stepped out
and hurried over to the window display. His eyes fastened hungrily
on the two pictures. He had passed them over without attention the
last time, but now be looked at them as a shipwrecked man eyes a
distant smudge of smoke.</p>

<p>The picture on the left-hand easel was an old print of
Westminster Abbey. The name, "Westminster Abbey" was printed
underneath in Gothic type.</p>

<p>On the right-hand easel there was a similar print of the Tower
of London. The name, "Tower of London," appeared underneath in
Gothic type, but something had been done to it&mdash;the first two
words had been blocked out with a pencil so that the only word
remaining was "London." And in the lower right-hand corner of the
picture there was a signature.</p>

<p>Benson pressed his face close to the window, trying to decipher
that signature in the dark. And his eyes blazed suddenly as he made
it out. It was a single scrawled name: Louis!</p>

<p>With fists clenched, Benson swung back to the car and climbed
in. Sally was watching him, her lips parted, one hand at her
breast. "You...you've found something?"</p>

<p>Benson gripped her wrist. "Are you sure those two pictures were
anonymous? There was no signature on either of them?"</p>

<p>"Positive. They were both unsigned&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, get going. Where's the county jail?"</p>

<p>"Back on Broad Street, at the corner of Meridian."</p>

<p>"Take me there!"</p>

<p>"You're mad, Avenger! The county jail is right next door to
police headquarters&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do as I say!"</p>

<p>Silently, Sally started the car, made a U turn and headed back
to Broad Street, then turned left. "Meridian is four
blocks&mdash;"</p>

<p>She threw a sidelong glance at Benson and her eyes became wide
with wonder. He had taken out a flat silver case, almost a
duplicate of the cigarette case. But this one contained no
cigarettes. He had it open on his lap, revealing several neat
little compartments containing pigments of various shades. There
were miniature artist's brushes in the case and wads of other
makeup material. Wonderingly, she watched his long and supple
fingers work deftly, applying a bit of makeup to cheekbones, a
touch of shading to his upper lip, and a bit of darkish color
underneath the eyes.</p>

<p>So engrossed was she that she almost sideswiped a car alongside
her. She uttered a gasp, twisted the wheel and averted catastrophe.
Thereafter she drove with her eyes straight ahead until they
reached the county jail.</p>

<p>"Here it is," she said. "The county jail&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off, gasping, as she saw the face beside her. She had
heard, of course, along with other stories, that The Avenger was a
master hand in the art of disguise. But she had always imagined
disguise as being associated with false mustaches, wigs, beards,
and other mysterious and cumbersome paraphernalia.</p>

<p>But she had seen with her own eyes that the only equipment The
Avenger had used was that small flat case of makeup. She had seen
that he had only applied a dab here and a touch there. Yet here sat
a different man, a new personality. The cheekbones were higher, the
upper lip seemed longer, the jaw seemed less square and instead of
the sense of innate strength which he had formerly conveyed, he now
appeared to be a man perhaps ten years older who had dissipated
much in earlier years and whose face showed it now in all the
cruelty of baggy eyes and flabby cheeks and unwelcome wrinkles.</p>

<p>The Avenger's eyes flickered as he noted her reaction. He nodded
as if satisfied. "I guess I'll pass," he said.</p>

<p>"But...but how could you do it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's the little things that change a man," he told her. "If I
put on a false beard, and a pair of eyeglasses, they'd see through
it in a minute. But when they look at my face now they'll see only
what I have put on it, plus the way I walk and talk."</p>

<p>He pressed her hand. "Park across the street, I notice there's a
parking space over there. Wait twenty minutes. If I don't come out
by then, get out of town."</p>

<p>He leaned over into the back and lifted the robe. Toby Dobermann
was asleep.</p>

<p>"The sleep will do him good. Good luck, Sally."</p>

<p>"Good luck to you!" she gulped. Then Benson was gone.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chapC6" name="chapC6">6. LONDON LOUIS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">HE mounted the broad stone steps of the county
jail with quick, nervous steps instead of his usual lithe,
free-swinging stride. And his shoulders were suddenly sloping, his
head cocked a bit to one side, his whole attitude that of another
man. It was as if a new person had been born with the makeup. And
this was the secret of The Avenger's success at impersonation, the
thing that had baffled his enemies time after time.</p>

<p>In the office of the jail he stepped to the desk and spoke in a
high, nervous voice. "I am an attorney&mdash;Ira Pinkney. I wish to
see a client of mine who is under arrest."</p>

<p>"Prisoner's name?" the clerk demanded.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;London Louis."</p>

<p>The clerk raised his eyebrows. "How come? I thought Percy Gilbie
was going to defend him."</p>

<p>Benson leaned over the desk and lowered his voice, but still
speaking in a rasping tone. "Confidentially, I've been retained by
Junius Jones. It&mdash;er&mdash;it's a rather ticklish case."</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m," said the clerk. "Ticklish is right. London Louis was
caught with the goods." He frowned at Benson. "You a Deerchester
lawyer? I don't think I've seen you before."</p>

<p>Benson shook his head. "I'm from the state capital."</p>

<p>Satisfied, the clerk made out an order slip and a few minutes
later, Benson&mdash;alias Ira Pinkney&mdash;was seated in a small
cubbyhole of a room at a table opposite London Louis.</p>

<p>For a moment he sat tensely, while London Louis looked him over
without enthusiasm. London Louis had seen him at the station for
only the briefest of time, but there was always a chance that he
might detect some faint resemblance that would arouse his
suspicions. But London Louis apparently had other things on his
mind.</p>

<p>"How come Gilbie ain't taking care of me?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The bogus lawyer smiled shiftily. "Frankly speaking, Louis,
Junius Jones is very dissatisfied with you. You certainly messed
things up."</p>

<p>"It wasn't my fault," whined Louis. "I was only supposed to
cover up. It was Benny Slocum who messed things up. He didn't shoot
quick enough. That Avenger is poison."</p>

<p>"It's not about the business at the station that Jones is sore,"
Benson told him.</p>

<p>Louis licked his lips. "Not about that? What else? Did I do
something wrong?"</p>

<p>Benson nodded jerkily. "It's about that business of tipping the
girl off&mdash;Neillie Gray."</p>

<p>He waited tautly for the reaction. He was gambling everything on
this moment.</p>

<p>Nellie Gray had managed to place that message in the picture,
London and Louis. It could only mean that the tip-off which had
sent her and Smitty into the trap had come from London Louis. He
waited with bated breath, watching the other's face.</p>

<p>"Whadda you mean? What did I do wrong about the tip-off? I told
her just what the boss said I should!"</p>

<p>"You sent her to the wrong place, you fool!"</p>

<p>"The wrong place? No, no. I swear I didn't. I sent her to the
gas station up in the hills. The one that's closed."</p>

<p>"You mean the one on Highway 9?"</p>

<p>"Hell, no. The one on the Corlear road, four miles out of town;
the one where they got the single cabin way back off the road.
Wasn't that right? The boss said he wanted them there so the
shooting wouldn't be heard. No one uses that road anymore since the
landslide on the other side of the hill."</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m," said Benson. His blood was racing so fast that he had
difficulty maintaining his new personality. "That seems to be the
right&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure, it's right. It's what the boss told me. Didn't that girl
and the big guy get there?"</p>

<p>"I think there's been some mistake," Benson said, rising. "I'll
talk to Jones again and see if we can't straighten it out."</p>

<p>"For Gawd's sake don't leave me out in the cold!" London Louis
choked. "Don't leave me to take this rap. You tell the boss if he
does I'll squawk my head off."</p>

<p>"Don't worry," said Benson. "I'll be back later. If any other
lawyers come to see you, even Gilbie, you're to refuse to see them.
Understand? Refuse to see everybody till I return. It's the safest
way."</p>

<p>"OK, counselor, whatever you say. Only convince the boss, will
you? I ain't taking no rap. He has ways of getting me outta
this."</p>

<p>Benson left as quickly as possible. He hurried indecently on the
way out.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chapC7" name="chapC7">7. FIERY CABIN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE old Corlear road climbed steeply from the city
limits, with half a dozen hairpin turns in half a mile. Dick Benson
tooled the car ahead, without perceptibly slowing up for those
curves. In the rear sat Toby Dobermann, wan and weak, with his head
resting on Sally's shoulder.</p>

<p>Benson drove for almost a mile thus, silently, tautly, before
the road straightened out, and began to climb at a less pronounced
angle. Suddenly he clamped down hard on the footbrake before the
barrier in the road. It consisted of two long wooden horses,
against which rested a signboard. The sign said:</p>
<br>

<p class="sign">ROAD CLOSED<br>
LANDSLIDE BEYOND<br>
DETOUR</p>
<br>

<p>An arrow pointed off to the right, toward a dirt road.</p>

<p>As The Avenger brought the car to a stop, Toby Dobermann said
weakly, "They closed this road to the public six months ago. The
overhanging rocks keep crumbling, and sliding down. One car was
crushed&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Benson had already descended. He stopped near the detour
sign and turned his flashlight on the ground. There were fresh tire
tracks here. Several cars had come through, not so long ago. And
there were marks on the ground to indicate that the wooden horses
had been moved and then swung back into place again. His eyes
glittered. London Louis' story was thus far borne out by the
evidence. He was banking on the truth of that story.</p>

<p>He removed the detour sign and pushed the wooden horses out of
the way. Then he returned and got in behind the wheel.</p>

<p>"Better watch out from here on," Toby Dobermann warned.</p>

<p>Benson nodded silently, and sent the car ahead. Now, as they
proceeded through the night, they heard faint, crackling sounds
somewhere in the distance, and The Avenger stiffened. His hands
tightened on the wheel, and he pressed down a bit farther on the
gas.</p>

<p>"That's gunfire!" Toby Dobermann exclaimed. "It's a couple of
miles away. The mountains carry the echoes&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sally uttered a little gasp. "Junius Jones' men must have opened
the attack on your friends."</p>

<p>Under the spur of those distant sounds of battle, The Avenger
urged the car along even faster.</p>

<p><br>
THE gunfire was closer now, and it suddenly mounted into a fresh
crescendo of staccato bursts. Someone was using a machine gun, up
ahead, around the next curve!</p>

<p>Benson brought the car to a swift stop and leaped out. "Wait
here!" he shouted to Sally and her husband. Then he was running
with long, space-consuming strides, around the sharp curve.</p>

<p>He came around the curve and saw the old, abandoned gas station
which London Louis had mentioned. It was a one-story structure, and
it had at some time in its history been painted red. The windows
were boarded up, the gas tanks dismantled. A couple of old,
stripped wrecks of automobiles lay in the graveled semicircular
driveway behind the pumps. And two other cars were pulled up in the
road. One of those cars was that in which Junius Jones had been
sitting when he spoke to Benson in the street. Benson recognized
its license number.</p>

<p>But he spared only a quick, all-embracing glance for all of
that. His attention became immediately centered upon the man who
was kneeling on the roof of the gas station and firing the
submachine gun. He was sending burst after burst up toward a cabin
about a hundred yards behind the gas station.</p>

<p>From where he stood, Benson saw that it was one of a
semicircular group of eight or ten cabins of the type once used to
accommodate the tourist trade. Both the parked cars had their
headlights focused upon that single cabin&mdash;the third from the
left&mdash;making it a shining target for the snipers. In addition,
the man on the gas station roof was using tracer bullets, and
Benson was able to watch the luminous trail of each burst as it
smashed through the flimsy walls of the shack. The gunner was
spraying his barrage slowly from left to right, and then back
again.</p>

<p>At the same time, Benson noted that tracer bullets were driving
into the cabin from two other directions. That meant three machine
guns in all. Swiftly, he located one of them over to the left,
behind a rusty oil drum; and the third on the right, behind a pile
of rocks.</p>

<p>Benson's eyes became agate-hard as he moved lithely forward, gun
in hand. His mouth was dry and parched, and there was a deep and
empty feeling high up in his chest. For he knew that nobody could
be left alive in that cabin. Those gunners of Junius Jones were
doing their murderous work in thorough and deadly fashion. Nellie
Gray and Smitty must be dead. He had come too late to save
them&mdash;but not too late to make the killers pay a high price
for their victory.</p>

<p>He raised his gun for a snap shot at the machine gunner on the
roof, but held his fire as a loud, shrill whistle sounded from
somewhere close at hand. Immediately, the barrage from the three
machine guns ceased. The grim and merciless headlights of the two
cars continued to pierce the darkness, holding the riddled cabin in
ruthless silhouette against the background of the night.</p>

<p>The piercing whistle signal had come from Junius Jones' car.
Benson was now able to discern Jones' pinched and cadaverous
countenance behind the bulletproof glass. The window was drawn
halfway down, but Jones' face was still well protected, for he did
not lift his head above the top of the open pane.</p>

<p>"All right!" he called, in a harsh and strident voice. "I guess
that did it. Go in, Stengle and Gore and Brower, and get their
bodies out." He chuckled horridly. "We'll take them back to
Deerchester and present them to The Avenger. We'll let him see his
dead friends&mdash;before we send him to join them!"</p>

<p>The man on the roof slung his machine gun over his shoulder and
slid down to the ground, while the other two gunmen emerged from
their places of concealment and converged upon it from the right
and the left.</p>

<p><br>
IT was just then that a great, deep-throated gust of laughter
seemed to spring from nowhere out of the night. It was powerful,
glorious laughter, vivid with the color of battle and bravery. And
when Benson heard that laughter, he heaved a great sigh, and some
of the tautness went out of him, and he almost smiled for there was
only one man in all the world who laughed like that&mdash;the big
Viking of a man who was known as Algernon Heathcote Smith.</p>

<p>Smitty was alive then! And Nellie Gray couldn't be dead, else
Smitty could never have laughed that way.</p>

<p>The three gunmen came to an abrupt halt in the clearing before
the semicircle of cabins. The headlights still pointed at their
cabin from the left; but it was not from there that the laughter
issued. It was from one of the other cabins in that group&mdash;one
that was in comparative darkness. And those machine gunners
crouched, suddenly stiff, and frightened, swinging their weapons'
noses around in vague motions, not sure just where to aim them or
where to shoot.</p>

<p>Abruptly, the deep-toned laughter ceased; and a mocking voice
called out: "All right, you rats. Let's see if you can take it
now!"</p>

<p>A heavy revolver began to thunder; orange flashes flamed at the
window of the end cabin on the right. And the foremost of the
machine gunners uttered a wild scream and threw up his arms and
pitched forward. The other two dropped flat on the ground. One of
them began to pull the trip of his machine gun, sending a wild
burst high above that end cabin. The third gunner rolled over and
over till he reached the protection of a stone wall which stood
perhaps fifty feet from the end cabin. Then he, too, trained his
machine gun on the target.</p>

<p>The two guns chattered for perhaps half a minute before Smitty,
firing from the window of the cabin, got the second gunner. And
almost at the same instant, Dick Benson, who had leaped forward as
soon as Smitty began to shoot, reached the stone wall.</p>

<p>Unnoticed in the darkness, Benson rose up behind the machine
gunner, clubbing his revolver, and brought it down hard on the
man's skull. The fellow's weapon dropped from his hands, he grunted
once, and slumped down behind the wall. All became silent as the
machine guns ceased their chatter.</p>

<p>Crouching behind the wall, Dick Benson puckered his lips and
hooted like an owl. Almost immediately, the hoot was returned from
the cabin&mdash;twice.</p>

<p>Benson smiled. One signal for Smitty, one for Nellie Gray. They
were both alive, then. They had outsmarted Junius Jones' killers by
exchanging cabins at the last moment. Those machine gunners had
poured burst after burst into an empty trap!</p>

<p>Benson rose to his feet beside the wall, and peered over to
where Junius Jones' car was parked. Jones had opened the door
cautiously, to investigate the sudden silence.</p>

<p>"Stengle!" he called in a low voice. "Gore! Brower!"</p>

<p>Benson remained silent. From the cabin where Smitty and Nellie
Gray were, there came no sound. It was as if they both understood
what was in The Avenger's mind, and were leaving the play in his
hands.</p>

<p>Another moment passed, and the door of the car opened just a bit
wider. Junius Jones' voice came in a higher key.</p>

<p>"Stengle! What's happened? Where are you? Answer me!"</p>

<p>Slowly, silently, The Avenger picked up the machine gun that the
dead gunman had dropped. His finger found the trip in the darkness.
He stepped away from the wall, but kept out of the streaking beams
of light from the headlamps of the two cars. He raised his voice,
deep and sonorous, and suddenly fraught with all the dread
solemnity of justice and retribution.</p>

<p>"This is The Avenger," he said. "Your time has come, Junius
Jones. Prepare to die!"</p>

<p>"Avenger!" The name came from Jones' lips like a gust of hot
wind laden with terror and hate. "How did you get here?"</p>

<p>Benson's voice was hard, unyielding, uncompromising. "Are you
ready to die, Jones?"</p>

<p>"Damn you&mdash;" Jones shrieked. And then the door of the car
slammed shut.</p>

<p>Benson waited, bleak and grim. From the cabin, Smitty came
running, his huge bulk looming vast and giant-like in the dark. He
was carrying the inert body of a man slung over his shoulder; and
behind came the trim figure of Nellie Gray, slim and blonde and
graceful. But the automatic in her hand was no less dangerous than
it would have been in the hand of any fighting man twice her
size.</p>

<p>Smitty deposited the unconscious man at the wall.</p>

<p>"Hi, Dick," he whispered. "You sure showed up at the right time.
I lost a bet with Nellie. I bet you wouldn't spot the message in
the picture on the easel!"</p>

<p>"I almost didn't," said Benson. He glanced down at the
unconscious man. "Who's this?"</p>

<p>"The murderer," said Smitty. "This is the guy for whom Toby
Dobermann was supposed to take the rap. He works for Jones. I've
got his written confession."</p>

<p>Benson nodded. His eyes were fixed upon Junius Jones' car. Jones
was behind the wheel now, and he had kicked the starter over. He
was backing the car frantically out of the graveled driveway now,
in an attempt to escape from the doom which The Avenger had
promised.</p>

<p>Nellie Gray put a hand on Benson's arm. "Dick! Are you going to
let him get away?"</p>

<p>Benson shook his head. He held the submachine gun ready, his
gaze following the progress of the car as it raced out into the
road, narrowly skimming the edge of the precipice. They heard its
motor race as Jones accelerated, heading for the curve.</p>

<p>"It's a bulletproof car!" Smitty exclaimed. "He's
safe&mdash;"</p>

<p>Smitty choked off the words as Benson raised the submachine gun
and sent a burst of tracer bullets fanning out across the road
directly in front of the racing car. He held his finger on the
trip, and the hail of steel-jacketed tracer slugs formed a fiery
barrier into which the front wheels churned. There was a popping
explosion which mingled with the chatter of the machine gun as the
front tire went.</p>

<p>The car swerved crazily, and they had a momentary view of Jones'
face above the wheel, as his white hands struggled with it. But the
car was out of control. It veered far over toward the edge of the
road, teetered for an instant on the brink, and then
disappeared.</p>

<p>Benson took his finger from the trip, and the machine gun became
silent. In the sudden stillness rose the terror-laden scream of
Junius Jones, torn from the very bowels of his frightened
consciousness, as he went hurtling down to his death over the
precipice.</p>

<p>Moments later they heard a crashing explosion as the car struck
almost a mile below. Benson ran to the edge, followed by Smitty and
Nellie. Far down flame was rising from the burning car.</p>

<p>"Come," said The Avenger. "We've got to tell Toby Dobermann that
the law doesn't want him any more. That confession you got ought to
clear him, Smitty."</p>

<p>The big man nodded absently. He was still looking down at the
funeral pyre of Junius Jones.</p>

<p>"That guy sure came a long way, looking for death!" he said in a
low voice.</p>

<p>Then he turned away and took Nellie Gray's hand, and they
followed The Avenger around the bend of the road to carry the news
of deliverance and freedom to Toby and his wife.</p>

<h2><a id="chapD1" name="chapD1">1. THE MIAMI BUS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE plump little man with the frightened eyes
boarded the bus at Jacksonville and selected the aisle seat next to
Nellie Gray. He mumbled a quick apology, laid his black leather
briefcase across his knees, and immediately opened a newspaper. He
spread it in front of him, effectively hiding his face, and did not
move for an hour. Nellie knew he was only pretending to read, for
he never turned the page. Twice she caught him furtively peering
past her, out of the window, just as passing cars overtook the bus.
Each time he did this he threw a swift glance at the car, then
buried his nose in the paper once more.</p>

<p>When the bus stopped for refreshments at St. Augustine the plump
little man did not get out with the rest of the passengers, but
continued his pretense of reading. Nellie squeezed past him into
the aisle and went out to the refreshment stand where she bought a
hot dog and a bottle of pop. While she was eating, surrounded by
the other passengers, she saw a long green convertible coupe come
flashing down the road and pull to a stop. It swung into the
parking space beside the bus and a man emerged from the rear. This
man wore a tan sport coat and his face was long and wooden. He said
something to his driver who remained at the wheel, and then he
swung his dark eyes upon the passengers. He scanned them with the
attitude of one who seeks a particular person. Nellie got a cold
feeling when she saw his eyes. They were almost fish-like in their
expressionless stare.</p>

<p>The man evidently did not find what he was looking for because
he turned and stared at the bus for a moment. Then he stepped over
to the open door and poked his head in. At the same time that he
did this he put his right hand in the pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>Nellie Gray's glance swept to the window of the bus where she
had seen the plump little man only a moment before the coupe
arrived, but now he was not visible.</p>

<p>Nellie knew that the plump little man had not left the bus. He
was still in there. But he couldn't be seen; therefore he must be
crouching down behind the seat. Hiding&mdash;from what?</p>

<p>She experienced a distinct sense of relief when the long-faced
man in the tan sport coat took his head out of the bus doorway and
returned to the green coupe. She knew with the sure instinct which
had made her The Avenger's right-hand "man" that the occupants of
the green coupe were the hunters, and the plump little man was the
quarry.</p>

<p>The long-faced man stepped back into the green coupe and it
backed out of the parking space. Its powerful eight-cylinder motor
rumbled throatily as the driver accelerated, and the coupe flashed
down the road toward Miami.</p>

<p>With the characteristic thoroughness which The Avenger had
instilled into all those who worked with him, Nellie Gray made a
mental note of the license number of that green coupe&mdash;it was
an Illinois plate, number TQ323. She filed that number in the back
of her mind and glanced at the bus window. The plump little man was
once more in evidence. He no longer had the newspaper in front of
his face. He was lighting a cigarette, and Nellie thought she
detected a flicker of a smile upon his lips&mdash;though she
couldn't tell for sure at this distance.</p>

<p>The bus driver blew his whistle and called out, "All aboard."
The passengers trooped back, eager to start on the last lap of the
long ride. There were several vacant seats, but Nellie passed them
up. Prompted by some curious motive which she could not herself
analyze, she resumed the same seat, slipping past the plump little
man.</p>

<p>He seemed to feel much better now and immediately engaged her in
conversation. "Going to meet your parents in Miami?" he asked.</p>

<p>Nellie Gray repressed a giggle. Clad in a white blouse and a
pair of navy-blue slacks, she looked as simple and unassuming as a
freshly graduated high-school girl. Her traveling companion
probably took her for a kid of seventeen or eighteen.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've traveled by myself for quite a while," she said
airily. She wondered what he would have said if he learned that she
was a veteran member of Justice, Inc.&mdash;that efficient fighting
organization headed by The Avenger, and devoted to championing the
rights of the little man against the overlords of crime in every
corner of the globe. The fact was that Nellie Gray had traveled to
many parts of the world which the plump man had never even heard
of. But he went on, blissfully unaware of the identity of the girl
at his side.</p>

<p>"Are you going to get a job in Miami? It must be easy to get a
job these days, what with all the defense work. What do you do for
a living? Waitress? Manicurist?"</p>

<p>Nellie lowered her eyes. "Well, I guess I could wait on
tables&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, miss," he said suddenly. "Maybe I have a job for
you. What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Elsie Jones," Nellie lied.</p>

<p>"Well, look here, Elsie." He lowered his voice. "I'm a lawyer.
Joplin is the name. Frederick Joplin. I'm going to Miami to handle
an important case for a client of mine. See this briefcase? It's
crammed with evidence. Evidence that will win the case for my
client!"</p>

<p>Nellie kept her hands in her lap and let her long lashes cover
her eyes. She waited for him to continue.</p>

<p>"Now the trouble is that my client's enemies may try to destroy
this evidence. They may try to take it away from me."</p>

<p>Nellie opened her eyes wide. "You don't say! Do you mean they
might try to do it by force?"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" He leaned closer to her, dropping his voice even
lower. "Now see here. I can put you in the way of making a little
money. Say two hundred dollars. How does that sound to you?"</p>

<p>"Why, that...that's wonderful, Mr. Joplin!"</p>

<p>He beamed at her. "Ah! That's fine. Now here&mdash;" He produced
a roll of bills from his pocket and peeled off ten tens. "Here's a
hundred dollars in advance. Take it!" He practically forced the
money into her hand.</p>

<p>"But...but what do I have to do to earn this, Mr. Joplin?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you." He took the briefcase off his knees and laid it
on her lap. "I want you to take charge of this evidence. When the
bus stops at Daytona, I'm getting off. I have a bit of business in
Daytona&mdash;one more bit of evidence to get. It'll take me an
hour or two, but unfortunately the bus won't wait."</p>

<p>"I see," Nellie said demurely, fingering the money in one hand
and touching the smooth leather of the briefcase with the other. It
was not a large briefcase&mdash;just comfortable enough to carry
under one arm. But it was rather heavy. And there was a small lock
which kept the brass snapper shut.</p>

<p>"It's locked, naturally," said Mr. Joplin. "Now listen
carefully, Elsie. I want you to remain on the bus when I leave you
at Daytona. You go on to Miami. There, you will go to the Sunset
Hotel and register. Go up to your room and wait until you hear from
me. I'll be there later in the day. When I pick up the briefcase
I'll give you the other hundred dollars. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Nellie. "It's clear."</p>

<p>If anyone had asked her she wouldn't have been able to say just
why she was doing this. She certainly wasn't doing it to help the
self-styled "Mr. Joplin" out of a jam, because he was lying from
the word go. Nellie, herself, was on a vacation, and The Avenger
had made her promise not to stick her pretty little nose into
anything that didn't concern her while she was resting in Florida.
But she'd never have been happy if she hadn't tried to solve this
puzzle of why Mr. Joplin was being hunted by the long-faced man in
the green convertible.</p>

<p>"Then everything is settled," Mr. Joplin was saying heartily.
"It's all arranged!" He patted her arm. "Don't forget now&mdash;the
Sunset Hotel!"</p>

<p>"But Mr. Joplin, you don't know anything about me. How can you
trust me with all this evidence&mdash;"</p>

<p>He laughed that off with a wave of his hand. "My dear, I'm an
excellent judge of human nature. I would trust you with my life!
Now listen carefully, Elsie. If anyone should approach you and ask
if you know me; if they should describe me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nellie smiled. "I'd tell them nothing."</p>

<p>"Excellent, my dear girl, excellent! I see you are wise beyond
your years. Perhaps I can give you a permanent job later. Do this
piece of work well, and perhaps I'll make you my secretary!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't that be wonderful, Mr. Joplin!" Nellie murmured,
veiling her eyes.</p>

<p>When the bus pulled in to Daytona Beach the driver announced a
ten-minute stop-over. Everybody descended. Some of the passengers
trooped into the Coffee Pot next door, while others strolled across
to the beach. Mr. Joplin beamed at Nellie as he helped her down
from the bus. He took her arm and led her out of the bus terminal
to the street.</p>

<p>"I'll leave you now, my dear&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped short, sucking his breath in with an audible
sound.</p>

<p>Nellie glanced in the direction in which he was staring, and saw
the familiar green convertible, parked about fifty feet away.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," Mr. Joplin said hastily. "I think I'll go out the
back way. It's nearer to where I have to go. Good-by, my dear. And
remember&mdash;the Sunset Hotel!"</p>

<p>That furtive, frightened look was back in his eyes as he let go
of her arm and hastily retreated toward the rear of the bus
terminal.</p>

<p>Nellie watched him, saw him go out through a door at the rear
and disappear into the alley behind the terminal.</p>

<p>Nellie turned and looked down the street. The green convertible
was still there. But the long-faced man in the tan sport coat was
nowhere in evidence. Neither was the driver of that car.</p>

<p>Nellie held the briefcase tight under her arm and went into the
Coffee Pot. She barely had time for a cup of tea before the driver
announced that it was time to leave. When the bus pulled out the
green convertible was gone. And Nellie Gray was alone in her seat.
Mr. Joplin had not returned.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chapD2" name="chapD2">2. THE SUNSET HOTEL</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IT was evening by the time the bus reached the
Flagler Street Terminal in Miami. Nellie had reservations in the
swanky Coronado Hotel, but she went to the Sunset instead. She was
intensely eager to delve into the mystery of Mr. Joplin and his
briefcase. She registered at the Sunset Hotel as Elsie Jones and
got Room 301, which was a corner room. As part of the service, the
bellboy left a copy of the local evening paper with her, and Nellie
idly glanced at the headlines. Suddenly she stiffened. She
read:</p>

<p class="headline">MAN MURDERED AT DAYTONA</p>

<p class="newspaper">An unknown man was found, stabbed to death, in
an alley behind the Fleetwood Bus terminal at Daytona Beach. Police
state that the object of the murder was doubtless robbery, for the
victim had been searched with special thoroughness, even to the
extent of ripping the lining of his coat. The killers removed
everything they found on the victim's body, even to his keys. There
was nothing left by which to identify him immediately. The dead man
was recognized by terminal employees as a passenger on the Miami
bus, which had stopped at Daytona for ten minutes&mdash;</p>

<p>Slowly, Nellie Gray put the paper down. She glanced at the
briefcase which lay on the desk. Its owner was dead. She was sure
that the killer was the man in the tan sport coat. But that killer
hadn't gotten what he sought. The thing for which Mr. Joplin had
been murdered was lying here on the desk.</p>

<p>Grimly, Nellie went to her bag and took out a small set of keys.
The lock on the briefcase was a simple one and it yielded to her
typewriter-case key. She raised the flap and began to draw out the
contents. And her blood began to race swiftly as she saw what the
briefcase contained. Mr. Joplin's "evidence" was queer indeed.</p>

<p>There were half a dozen plushlined boxes in the briefcase. The
first box contained a jeweled horseshoe about six inches long. At
conservative estimate it could not be worth less than a quarter of
a million dollars. It was made of platinum and it was studded with
diamonds&mdash;large diamonds, brilliant and blue-white, and all
matched in size from two carats at the ends, to a huge ten-carat
stone at the apex of the arch. The thing glittered in her hand like
something alive and dynamic!</p>

<p>Nellie put it down and opened the next box. Upon the plush
cushion in that box there rested a diadem of diamonds which was
breathtakingly beautiful. The stones sparkled and shone in the
electric light with almost unholy beauty. She opened the other
boxes and as the untold wealth of their contents was exposed,
Nellie Gray began to understand that this must be some royal or
imperial collection, pilfered from some royal vaults. For the value
in dollars of these jewels was beyond estimate.</p>

<p>Mr. Joplin must have been desperate indeed to have intrusted
this treasure to a girl he had never seen before. Desperate? Or
clever, perhaps? But not quite clever enough. For now he was dead.
But if his enemies knew where this treasure was&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly, on an impulse, Nellie stepped over to the window. She
turned one of the slats of the Venetian blind so that she could
look out into the street. And, immediately, her blood began to
race. For there, on the opposite side of the street, stood the
green convertible!</p>

<p>That man in the tan sport coat had traced her here! How he had
done it she couldn't understand. Even as she watched through the
blind she saw the now-familiar tan sport coat. The man was crossing
the street toward the car. He was apparently coming from the hotel.
He must have been downstairs at the desk, inquiring about her.</p>

<p>Nellie saw him lean in at the window and talk to the driver of
the car. The convertible immediately pulled away, and the
long-faced man remained at the curb. He lit a cigarette and stood
there, watching the hotel.</p>

<p>Nellie stepped away from the window. She switched on the radio,
tuned it to a local Miami station, and then went over to the desk
and looked down at the fabulous fortune in jewels which lay spread
before her. There was enough wealth here to tempt anyone to commit
murder. She was sure that the man who had called himself Joplin had
not been the rightful owner. It should not be difficult to
ascertain who owned them. It must indeed be a famous
collection.</p>

<p>Nellie made her decision swiftly. She had gone far enough in
this matter on her own. Her duty was clear. She must phone the
police and turn these jewels over to them. At the same time she
must tell them of the man in the tan sport coat. They could pick
him up and they'd have their murderer, and at the same time a
solution of the entire case. That course of action, she felt, was
what The Avenger would have taken. This was no case for Justice,
Inc. Here was not involved any matter of injustice to some
unfortunate who could not fight back against the overwhelming power
of the overlords of the underworld. It was a matter of murder and
theft, purely a police-routine case.</p>

<p>That was the way she saw it at the moment. She reached for the
telephone, and already had the receiver off the hook when she
stopped abruptly. A news announcer had cut in on the radio
program:</p>

<p>"In connection with the murder of the unknown bus passenger at
Daytona Beach, the police have narrowed down their search to one
suspect, whom they expect to apprehend within the next hour. It has
been established that the murdered man was accompanied by an
auburn-haired girl dressed in a white blouse and navy-blue slacks.
She was seen in his company at the Terminal and the victim was
found stabbed to death immediately after the bus left Daytona.
Furthermore, the auburn-haired girl was seen to be carrying a black
leather briefcase which had belonged to the victim. With utter
callousness, this auburn-haired girl rode the bus into Miami,
carrying the briefcase, and left the Miami Terminal with the other
passengers. Police have her fingerprints taken from the seat she
occupied in the bus, and they are conducting a fine-tooth comb
search of all Miami hotels and of all busses and trains leaving the
city. She cannot hope to escape..."</p>

<p>Nellie gulped hard and put the receiver down. If the police
found her here, with these treasures in her possession, she'd have
a hard time clearing herself of the murder charge. She could just
imagine a district attorney laughing with hard incredulity at her
story that the plump Mr. Joplin had given her a briefcase worth an
emperor's ransom&mdash;and had trusted her to deliver it to him at
the Sunset Hotel.</p>

<p>Acting swiftly she swept the Jewels back into the briefcase. She
had only a small overnight bag with her, for her trunk was coming
by express and would arrive tomorrow at the Coronado Hotel. She
stuffed the briefcase into the overnight bag and went to the window
for a last look before departing.</p>

<p>She peered out into the street and her heart sank. The green
convertible was just returning. Four men emerged. Long-face spoke
to them swiftly for a moment, indicating the hotel with a nod of
his head. Immediately, two of them disappeared around the corner
and two crossed over toward the hotel entrance.</p>

<p>And even as she watched a second car drew up behind the green
convertible. This was a black limousine. More men emerged from it
and she saw the man in the tan sport coat giving them swift orders,
then saw them cross toward the hotel.</p>

<p>Her eyes flickered. The sober truth was that she was trapped
here in the Sunset Hotel; trapped until the man in the tan sport
coat decided to launch his attack&mdash;or until the police
came.</p>

<p>Swiftly, she picked up the overnight bag. Then she opened her
door and darted out into the corridor. Far down the hall she spied
a broom closet. She ran to it, pulled the door open, and peered
inside. There were several pails in there, a couple of mops, and a
laundry hamper. She opened the hamper, lifted out a pile of the
soiled linen and pushed the overnight bag into it. Then she piled
the linen on top of it. She closed the door of the broom closet and
sped back to her room. Just as she reached it she heard the
elevator cage stop at her floor, saw the door begin to slide open.
Without waiting to see who was coming up, she stepped into her room
and closed the door. She heard the elevator door clang shut, but
could not hear any footsteps on the carpeted floor out there.</p>

<p>With a sinking sensation at her heart she went back to the
telephone. There was only one thing to do&mdash;a thing she hated
to be reduced to: she had to call The Avenger for help. Dick
Benson&mdash;The Avenger&mdash;would of course drop everything and
fly down here. So would Smitty&mdash;Algernon Heathcote
Smith&mdash;who called himself The Avenger's left-hand man, and who
could go berserk at the mere hint of anyone's harming a hair of
Nellie's head. But Nellie squirmed at the thought of the big
razzberry Smitty would give her when it was all over. She would
just imagine his great, hearty, booming laughter. "Hereafter, we'll
have to send a nursemaid along with you, half-pint!" he'd chuckle.
And then he'd probably add: "Can't trust you out alone till you
grow up!"</p>

<p>Nellie shuddered. It would be humiliating. But it couldn't be
helped. She had to make the call. She lifted the receiver.</p>

<p>And it was only then that she realized the full extent of the
trap in which she was snared. For there was no reply from the
switchboard.</p>

<p>The line was dead.</p>

<p>She had been mistaken in thinking that the enemy only intended
to watch her. She had misjudged the man in the tan sport coat. And
she realized that she should have known better. With a huge fortune
in jewels at stake, this enemy would not be content to await
developments. He would strike and strike quickly. His men must have
taken over the switchboard downstairs. She had committed the
unpardonable blunder of underestimating her enemy&mdash;and the
penalty might be swift death. She was cut off now from all aid. She
was alone and on her own.</p>

<p>Slowly, she put down the receiver. With her senses keyed up to
acute pitch by the imminence of danger, she heard the faint
scraping sound as a key was cautiously inserted into the lock of
the old-fashioned door. Someone on the outside was using a pass
key.</p>

<p>She sprang to the door, reached it just as the key was turning
in the lock, and her fingers found the catch. She twisted it
fiercely, double-locking the door just in the nick of time. The
turning key on the other side caught as the double-locked tumblers
snapped. The man in the corridor must have realized at once had
happened, for she heard the key being withdrawn. Then a voice
spoke, close to the door: "Better open up quietly! You haven't got
a chance!"</p>

<p>Nellie's answer was to flick off the electric-light switch,
plunging the room in darkness. An oblong panel of light shafted in
through the transom above, from the hall. Her face was set, her
lips clamped tight as she realized that the enemy could reach her
through that transom.</p>

<p>Deliberately, she took the pistol out of the waistband of her
slacks. She stood to one side of the door.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she asked. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Never mind who we are. You know what we want. Are you going to
open up?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not."</p>

<p>"Then we're coming in."</p>

<p>"Better not. I warn you, I'm armed."</p>

<p>"We're ten to one. Whoever you are, you must be clever enough to
understand that we mean business. Your only chance is to hand over
that stuff. Pass it out through the transom and we'll go away."</p>

<p>Nellie laughed. "First you tell me I'm clever, then you take me
for a fool."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, then the same voice. "All right,
you know the score. We can't let you live. It's too bad. I
understand you're a good-looking girl. It's too bad you have to
die."</p>

<p>"Before you start," Nellie said calmly, "don't forget that
there'll be something of a fight. There'll be shooting. Every guest
in the hotel will hear it&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man outside chuckled. "We've taken over the hotel. The
management and the guests think we're F.B.I. agents. They're
co-operating with us!"</p>

<p>"I see," Nellie said quietly. "Well, I have one more ace up my
sleeve. Would you care to hear it before you start your
attack?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. We can spare you another minute."</p>

<p>"All right. The stuff you're looking for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"It's not here!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" There was another moment of silence. Then, "You've cached
the stuff somewhere?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you, miss. You came directly here from the bus
terminal. We know because we checked with your cab driver. You
didn't stop anywhere."</p>

<p>"You can believe me or not, as you choose," Nellie said. "But if
I'm killed when you attack, and you don't find the stuff here, I
imagine you'll feel pretty bad."</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes. Hm-m-m. I wonder if you're bluffing. The chances
are that you are bluffing. But I can't afford to gamble. We shall
have to take you alive."</p>

<p>"That may be a little difficult, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Difficult? Yes. But not impossible. I shall have to send for
some additional equipment." His voice took on a queer, sardonic
edge. "Please wait till I return. Don't go away!"</p>

<p>Tensely, Nellie listened at the door. She heard the murmur of
voices, then that same voice, raised a bit louder. "Sturm and
Corbey, you will remain here. If she attempts to break out, shoot
to disable her, but not to kill. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>She heard grunts of acknowledgment and then, a moment later, the
clang of the elevator door as the man who had spoken to her
departed. In the dark, she moved over to the window. She waited,
and then saw the man in the tan sport coat crossing the street
toward the convertible. It was he, then, with whom she had fenced
verbally. She watched while he talked for a moment with the driver.
Then the convertible drove off, leaving him at the curb.</p>

<p>She stood at the window and watched the street, waiting. After
twenty minutes the green convertible reappeared. Two men came over
to assist the one in the tan sport jacket. The chauffeur handed
each of them several small, round black objects which they put
quickly into their pockets. Then they all crossed the street toward
the hotel.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chapD3" name="chapD3">3. THE KING OF KILLERS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">NELLIE GRAY knew now that she was beaten. Those
small round objects were tear-gas bombs.</p>

<p>But she wasn't going to remain on the defensive, to let herself
be smoked out of here like a hunted animal. She hurriedly moved
toward the dresser. By dint of pushing and pulling at it she
finally managed to jockey it over to the door. Just as she got it
in place she heard the elevator door opening, then the voice of the
man in the tan jacket.</p>

<p>"All right, let's not waste any more time. Lob one in!"</p>

<p>Nellie scrambled up on the dresser and got a clear view of the
corridor. She saw two of the men, each with a tear-gas bomb, their
arms raised to hurl.</p>

<p>Nellie's face was tense and set. She smashed out the pane and
thrust the pistol's snout out. She pulled the trigger twice,
swiftly, and both of those men went down as the little weapon
barked spitefully. She hadn't had time to aim with too much care,
but she got one of those men just over the heart, and the other in
the shoulder. The tear-gas bombs rolled away down the corridor and
exploded, one after the other. A dense cloud of acrid smoke rose
from them.</p>

<p>The wounded man screamed out, "Get me out of here, Haggard! It's
choking me&mdash;"</p>

<p>And the voice of the man in the tan jacket cut sharply into that
cry for help: "Shut up, you fool, I told you never to use that
name!"</p>

<p>Standing on the dresser with her face back from the transom,
Nellie Gray felt a sudden wild thrill course through her body.
Haggard! She should have known it before! Only Royce Haggard could
be so ruthless, so deadly swift in action. It was barely four
months since Royce Haggard had brought off the most daring jail
break in the history of the country. Together with nine other
lifers, he had made a clean getaway from a Midwest penitentiary.
They had shot their way across the country into hiding, leaving a
pitiful trail of corpses behind. Huge rewards were posted. But the
Haggard gang had seemed to disappear from the face of the earth.
Here, then, was where they had turned up. But Nellie had seen
pictures of Haggard. His face must have been changed by plastic
surgery. That was why his expression was so wooden, so
fish-like.</p>

<p>The acrid smoke spread in the corridor and some of it seeped in
through the transom. Nellie's eyes began to smart. She stepped down
from the dresser, pulled a blanket off the bed and climbed up
again. She began to stuff it into the opening. She heard sounds of
commotion in the corridor as guests came out of their rooms and
Haggard's suave voice as he reassured them: "It's all right, folks,
we're Federal agents. We have a dangerous criminal trapped in
there. Get back in your rooms and lock your door and you'll be
safe&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nellie yanked the blanket away from the transom and put her face
close to the jagged hole in the glass. She kept it there in spite
of the stinging gas and raised her voice as loud as possible: "He
lies! They're not Federal agents. That's the Haggard gang! Call the
police!"</p>

<p>But even as she shouted that warning she knew it was useless.
Haggard's men controlled the switchboard. They'd not allow anyone
to leave, or to phone till they had accomplished their purpose.</p>

<p>She drew her head in and just at that moment a third tear-gas
bomb came lobbing up through the transom. It shattered the rest of
the glass in the frame, struck the edge of the dresser on the way
down, and exploded. Immediately, Nellie was engulfed in a cloud of
pungent, choking gas. Her eyes began to burn and smart and fill
with tears.</p>

<p>She closed them, held her breath, and jumped down off the
dresser. Blindly she pawed her way to the bathroom, and pulled the
door shut behind her, locking it. But the gas was already in there,
and she got only a little relief.</p>

<p>She felt her way to the window and thrust her head out, but her
eyes were so inflamed that the relief was negligible. Behind her
she heard a shattering crash as someone hurled himself against the
door. They had broken in! Blindly, she fired at the sound, but she
knew she had missed when she saw a huge, weird shape loom up in
front of her. It was Haggard, and his face was covered by a gas
mask. She thrust the pistol at him, her finger on the trigger, but
her hand was struck down viciously, and the gun exploded into the
floor. Then something struck her on the side of the head and she
fell forward, semi-conscious. Her hands were twisted behind her
back, and a pair of handcuffs was snapped on. In her ear was the
voice of Haggard, muffled by his gas mask: "Where is that
stuff?"</p>

<p>Nellie laughed, almost hysterically. "Kill me, Royce Haggard!
Why don't you kill me?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, you'll talk first."</p>

<p>"Never! I'll never talk!"</p>

<p>"Never is a long time. Maybe too long for you!"</p>

<p>She felt herself lifted helplessly across his shoulder, like a
sack of flour, and carried through the smoke. She must have lost
consciousness for a few moments, because the next thing she knew, a
gust of cold, clean air revived her, and she was being carried
across the street to the green convertible. Half a dozen men with
machine guns were posted around to guard against the arrival of the
police. Haggard was leaving nothing to chance. The stakes were high
and these men were desperate and resourceful criminals.</p>

<p>Nellie opened her mouth to shout, but a brutal hand thrust a
wadded handkerchief between her teeth, effectively gagging her. She
was roughly dumped on to the floor of the convertible and it was
moving smoothly away, with Royce and another man sitting in the
seat above her.</p>

<p>As they cleared the outskirts of the city Nellie writhed with
helpless rage. Haggard stooped down and made sure the gag was tight
in her mouth, so that she could not make a last appeal for help.
And then they were out on the Tamiami Trail accelerating to a swift
pace, racing away from Miami.</p>

<p>After a while Haggard took the handkerchief away from her mouth,
sat up and lit a cigarette. He looked down at her, allowing the
smoke to trickle from his nostrils.</p>

<p>"Well, miss," he said suavely, "are you thinking of talking? It
might be better for you. We're going to have a long time to spend
in coaxing you."</p>

<p>He bent down deliberately and placed the glowing tip of his
cigarette against Nellie's forearm. With his free hand he gripped
her handcuffed wrist so that she could not twist away.</p>

<p>The excruciating agony of that fiery burn was almost unbearable.
But Nellie clamped her teeth hard and held herself rigid.</p>

<p>Haggard grunted and removed the cigarette tip from her arm.
Nellie felt herself about to faint as the agony coursed through her
body, but she fought it off. Haggard looked down at her and said
softly, "You're very brave, my dear girl. But it won't help. Just
think&mdash;will you be able to stand a continuous treatment like
that? For hours on end? Perhaps for days? Believe me, you'll beg to
tell me where the Zaharoff jewels are hidden. If you're wise you'll
save yourself a good deal of torture and speak now."</p>

<p>Nellie's eyes opened wide. The Zaharoff jewels! She forgot the
fiery agony which was almost numbing her arm. Of course! The
Zaharoff jewels! It was Cornelius Zaharoff who had established a
private empire fifty years ago on one of the islands of the East
Indies. Trading in copra and rubber, he had amassed a gigantic
fortune which he transmuted into costly jewels for the Armenian
wife he had brought with him to share his empire. He had called her
the queen of the island and bedecked her with jewels. For two
generations the Zaharoffs had ruled their island with an iron hand,
until the war had brought the swarming Japanese barbarians.
Zaharoff's son had fled with the fortune in jewels, had brought
them to the United States, only to have them stolen in a ruthless
holdup by the Haggard gang. Haggard had locked the entire family,
including their retainers, in the refrigerator to die. Haggard had
been caught subsequently, but there had been no survivors of that
crime who could identify him. Young Zaharoff had been away at the
time. So Haggard had gotten a life sentence for another crime, and
no one had ever been sure that it had been the Haggard gang which
had perpetrated the Zaharoff atrocity.</p>

<p>Now here was the proof. But Nellie thought bitterly as she lay
on the floor of the racing car that she, too, would never live to
identify Royce Haggard.</p>

<p>The car swung off the highway and bumped along what must have
been a dirt road, then came to a stop. Nellie was lifted out and
carried over someone's shoulder into a shack of some sort and
dumped on the floor in an inner room. A few minutes later Haggard
entered with two men. At a curt order from him, Nellie was roughly
lifted and seated in a rickety chair with her arms forced backward
over the top, still handcuffed so that she could not move an
inch.</p>

<p>Haggard stood over her, puffing a cigarette to glowing life. His
eyes were small, veiled, fish-like; his face woodenly
expressionless. He got the cigarette glowing and held it before her
face. "Your eyes, my dear," he said softly. "They're beautiful
eyes. I shall take the left one first." He moved the glowing end
closer. "You'll naturally close your eye as the cigarette
approaches, my dear. Consequently, it will burn through the
eyelid."</p>

<p>Staring up at him, Nellie knew that this was the end. She knew
that this man meant exactly what he said. He was going to do the
thing that he threatened. He wasn't bluffing. There was nothing to
stop him, not even a bit of human feeling. He wanted the Zaharoff
treasure and he was going to get it.</p>

<p>Nellie could almost feel the searing agony that would come in a
moment when the cigarette end touched her lid. Her eyes were still
inflamed by the tear gas. But that had been nothing to this. She
felt her knees trembling. She strained every muscle of her lithe
body to break free&mdash;without avail. She stared in fascination
at that glowing tip of fire inching closer with the expressionless
face of Royce Haggard behind it.</p>

<p>"We waited five years in jail for this chance," Haggard was
saying softly. "We had the Zaharoff treasure cached away and we
planned carefully so as not to muff the prison break. We sent
Procter&mdash;that's your plump friend on the bus&mdash;to get the
stuff, but he thought he could cross us and make his getaway. You
know what happened to him." Haggard's face moved closer with the
cigarette. "Do you think we'll let anything stand in the way now?
Not even your pretty eyes, my dear!"</p>

<p>In a desperate, frantic effort to gain time, Nellie exclaimed,
"But you'll kill me anyway&mdash;even if I tell you!"</p>

<p>"That's right, my dear. But at least you'll look beautiful in
your coffin. And the pain. It's better to die without pain, believe
me."</p>

<p>He moved the cigarette up so close that Nellie involuntarily
blinked. She thought her eyelids were being singed.</p>

<p>"Wait!" she gasped.</p>

<p>Haggard did not move the cigarette. "I'm waiting," he said
impassively.</p>

<p>"I checked the stuff," Nellie lied swiftly. "In the hotel
safe!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Haggard. He stood up to his full height, removing the
cigarette. "The hotel safe! So simple! And I never thought of it!"
He chuckled and spoke to one of the two men who had remained
stonily silent throughout the ordeal. "You see, Corbey, how
impossible it is to foresee everything? To think of everything? We
were looking for clever tricks, and this girl used the simplest one
of all. The hotel safe!"</p>

<p>Corbey said glumly, "We can't go for it now. The cops'll be
swarming all over the place. By this time the hotel people will
know we aren't F.B.I."</p>

<p>"Naturally," said Haggard. "We'll have to wait till just before
dawn. We'll take five men. That'll be plenty. There'll be no more
than one policeman on guard by then. We shouldn't have any trouble
at all with one policeman, eh? And the clerk will be glad to oblige
us by opening the safe!"</p>

<p>Corbey grinned. "You bet he will! Just show him the lighted
butt!"</p>

<p>Haggard nodded. He turned to Nellie. "Maybe you're lying. Maybe
not. If you've lied about checking the stuff in the hotel safe,
you've gained yourself five or six hours. You're welcome to them.
But believe me, if the stuff isn't in the safe, you'll wish you
hadn't talked at all!"</p>

<h2><a id="chapD4" name="chapD4">4. THE AVENGER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">ON BLEEK STREET in the city of New York there is a
modest building upon the front of which appears a small plaque
bearing the cryptic inscription: Justice, Inc. Bleek Street is no
thoroughfare. It is a dead-end street and there are no pedestrians
who pass by chance. Only those enter Bleek Street who are bound for
the building of Justice, Inc. And those are people in deadly need
of help. For this is the headquarters of Dick Benson&mdash;The
Avenger. Having himself passed through a baptism of fire, his life
and his huge fortune have since been devoted to saving others from
the ordeal to which he was subjected. No person who seeks his
protection from the overlords of crime&mdash;in whatever part of
the world it may be&mdash;is denied assistance. The organization
which The Avenger has built-up is small, but compact and deadly
efficient. Operating like the well-greased fighting machine that it
is, it clicks on all eight once it rolls into action.</p>

<p>But this evening there was no action at Justice, Inc.</p>

<p>Benson was fiddling idly with the dials of a powerful receiving
set while the huge figure of Smitty, his powerful aid, was cramped
into a chair, his huge hand gripping a telephone. Upon the
foreheads of both of them there was a frown of worry.</p>

<p>At last Smitty finished his telephone conversation and racked
the phone. He stood up, towering, big and powerful, like some
viking god of old, a great figure of a man, with a deep and
rumbling voice.</p>

<p>"There's something wrong, Dick." he said. "The Fleetwood people
say that the bus arrived at Miami fifty minutes ago, If Nellie had
been on it she should have phoned by this time. She knows our
standing rule!"</p>

<p>The standing rule was that whenever any one member of Justice
Inc., was away from headquarters&mdash;whether on business or
pleasure, he or she must keep in constant touch by phone, radio or
wire. There was good and sufficient reason for that rule; Justice,
Inc. had made itself many terrible enemies in the course of its
constant battle against crime. And every member of the organization
walked always in the shadow of death. Therefore, the precaution of
constant communication. If headquarters failed to hear from a
missing member on time, the others immediately swung into
action.</p>

<p>"Did anyone leave the bus along the route?" Benson asked, still
fiddling with the radio.</p>

<p>"The clerk didn't say," Smitty grumbled. "In fact he was damned
close-mouthed. I gave him Nellie's description and I thought he was
going to say something, but he changed his mind and asked for my
number. Then there was trouble on the line and we were
disconnected."</p>

<p>"I don't like it," said Benson. "Nellie must be in a jam. Phone
Holloway. Tell him I want the fastest plane in the hangar. That
converted Beaufort fighter will do&mdash;the one the British
government sent us, when we designed the gun assembly for the
wings. It'll do three hundred cruising."</p>

<p>Smitty nodded and got on the phone, swiftly gave instructions.
"Warm it up fast," he ordered. "We'll be taking off in twenty
minutes!"</p>

<p>Just as he hung up, Dick Benson got a hairline tuning on a Miami
station. They both became tense as they heard a news announcer:</p>

<p>"...that the police are not sure whether the incredible battle
of the Sunset Hotel is linked with the auburn-haired girl who is
being sought as the murderer of the unknown man at the Daytona
Beach bus terminal. There is reason to believe that the men who
boldly posed as F.B.I. agents in that battle were in reality a
contingent of the Royce Haggard gang. It boils down to the fact
that they abducted a girl from the Sunset Hotel&mdash;a girl who
may or may not be the one wanted for murder."</p>

<p>With a muttered oath, Dick Benson snapped off the radio and
sprang up.</p>

<p>Smitty uttered an ejaculation of dismay. "She's tangled up with
the Haggard crowd! And all alone! Good Lord, she hasn't a
chance!"</p>

<p>They both sprang to a desk in a far corner of the room and each
took an extra gun&mdash;a heavy .45 caliber automatic. In addition
they helped themselves to several other accessories which had been
developed in The Avenger's laboratories for the specific purpose of
fighting fire with fire.</p>

<p>"Let's go!" Dick Benson said. "And God grant that we aren't too
late!"</p>

<p>As they hurried down the back way to their secret garage, Smitty
groaned. "It'll take us almost five hours to make Miami. If she's
in Haggard's hands she won't live that long&mdash;unless she's got
an ace up her sleeve!"</p>

<p>It was exactly four hours and seven minutes later that Dick
Benson put the Beaufort down on the airfield just outside Miami. He
had pushed the ship as she had never been pushed before&mdash;even
by test pilots. She was whining in every strut and for the last
hundred miles they had thought that the port wing would tear itself
off. But the ship held together by a miracle and they hopped out of
it and raced to the waiting car for which they had radioed. Sixteen
minutes later they were outside the Sunset Hotel. Over the radio,
while flying south, they had caught further news reports, and they
now had most of the story pieced together. Benson had decided to
start from the Sunset Hotel on the theory that it was Nellie who
had been kidnaped by the men posing as Federal agents. They left
their hired car a block away and walked past the Sunset Hotel on
the opposite side of the street. It was almost four a.m. and the
city was as quiet as a tomb, with the heat hanging heavy in the
air. The semitropical dawn would break in a short while but now the
moon was overcast and the night was dark.</p>

<p>It was just as they were almost abreast of the hotel that Benson
suddenly seized Smitty's arm and dragged him in under the shelter
of an overhanging balcony. He was not a moment too soon, for a
black limousine which had swung into the street with dimmed-out
lights stopped at the entrance of the hotel. Three men emerged and
a uniformed patrolman who was evidently on guard, came forward to
meet them, half drawing a revolver from his holster. But he had no
chance to get it all the way out for there was a spurt of flame
from a silenced gun in the car and the policeman went down, dead
before he hit the sidewalk. Then three more men came out of the
car. One of them dragged the policeman's body over against the wall
where it would be out of the way. Then all six entered the hotel,
leaving one man at the wheel.</p>

<p>Smitty's face became flushed. "Damn them! That must be the
Haggard gang. That's the way they operate&mdash;cold-blooded fish.
Come on, Dick, let's take them&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Benson put a hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Not so fast, Smitty. Follow me!" Smitty followed him, both men
edging carefully back, hugging the shadow of the overhanging
balcony, till they turned the corner. Benson climbed into their car
and Smitty crowded in beside him.</p>

<p>"If this outfit has Nellie," Benson explained swiftly, "it'll do
her no good for us to tackle them here!"</p>

<p>Smitty's eyes glittered, He nodded. "You're right, Dick!"</p>

<p>He put his big hands on the wheel, tooled it around in a
complete turn and switched the lights off. He pulled up just far
enough so that they could see the front of the hotel. They had only
a few minutes to wait before the six men emerged from the hotel. In
the clear night air their voices carried, sharp and distinct.</p>

<p>"She lied, Corbey," said a suave voice. "The stuff isn't in the
safe!"</p>

<p>"Damn her!"</p>

<p>"She'll be damned, all right! Wait till we get back!"</p>

<p>The men piled into the limousine and it pulled away.</p>

<p>Smitty eased the car around the corner, still without lights,
and fell in behind, keeping about a hundred yards in the rear.</p>

<p>"This," he said viciously to Dick Benson, "is going to be a
party!"</p>

<p>Benson said nothing. He only sat grimly, staring after the car
they were following.</p>

<p>Nellie's position was extremely uncomfortable. Her arms were
still handcuffed around the back of the chair and she was unable to
move to any extent. And the cigarette burn on her forearm hurt
excruciatingly. In the other room she heard two or three of the men
moving about, waiting for the return of the rest. She estimated
that forty minutes had passed before she heard the car outside, and
then the voices of the returning killers. She steeled herself for
the ordeal that was to come. There would be no more delay now. They
would stop at nothing now to drag the truth from her. And she knew
enough about Haggard to understand that he would not cease the
torture when she finally talked. He would want to make sure she was
telling the truth this time.</p>

<p>But her head was high when the door opened and Haggard walked
in, followed by Corbey and Sturm. He said not a word. He only stood
in front of her and deliberately took a cigarette from his pocket.
Just as deliberately he lit it and puffed it into a vicious glow.
Then he reached out and seized her hair in one hand and thrust the
cigarette at her eyes.</p>

<p>But the glowing end of the cigarette never reached its goal,
for, suddenly, the lights blinked out and the room was plunged into
total darkness. Only the cigarette glowed in the black void.</p>

<p>Someone cursed and Haggard raised his voice, calling to the men
in the outer room. "Gurko! Put a fuse in&mdash;"</p>

<p>But someone called to him. "It ain't the fuse. Haggard. Someone
snipped the power line outside&mdash;"</p>

<p>A window smashed somewhere in the room and a powerful
searchlight played on the occupants, rested a split second on
Nellie, then swung to cover Haggard and the other two. Almost as if
the beam of light were a signal, a heavy automatic began to bark,
following the searchlight around the room from one man to another.
The gun barked only three times, each shot a bull's-eye. Haggard
went down with a bullet in his lung, the other two with slugs in
their stomachs.</p>

<p>Nellie's eyes lighted with relief and a sudden surge of hope.
"Dick!" she shouted. "The Avenger!"</p>

<p>From the other room came a frightened shout: "The Avenger!"</p>

<p>It was drowned by the thunderous roar of another gun out there.
Meanwhile, Dick Benson leaped in through the window and helped
Nellie up from the chair.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" he said fervently.</p>

<p>The shooting was still going on in the next room, but, by the
time Benson reached the door it had stopped. He shouted, "O.K.,
Smitty," and yanked the door open. His flashlight beam crossed
Smitty, illuminating the shambles which the room had become. In the
door the huge, powerful figure of Algernon Heathcote Smith stood,
like an avenging god out of the Norse tales, a smoking gun in his
hand. And on the floor was the evidence of his shooting.</p>

<p>"What about Nellie?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Safe!" said Benson.</p>

<p>He swung around and Nellie nodded toward the figure of Haggard,
lying on his back, with blood frothing at his mouth. "That's Royce
Haggard," she said. "He has the key to these handcuffs."</p>

<p>Benson knelt beside him, went through his pockets and found the
key. Swiftly he released Nellie Gray, and Smitty came over and
patted her on the shoulder, speechless with relief at seeing her
alive and unharmed.</p>

<p>Haggard was dying fast. He spat blood and tried to speak.
"Before I die...tell me...where you hid...the Zaharoff
treasure!"</p>

<p>Nellie knelt beside him. She felt no resentment now, only a
coldness. "In the clothes hamper in the broom closet," she told
him. "It was the simplest place I could find."</p>

<p>Royce Haggard groaned. "It was...too damned simple. I'm
always...looking for clever...tricks...that's what...tripped
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>And he died.</p>

<p>Smitty turned and took Nellie by the shoulder and shook her. He
had recovered some of his poise. "Good Lord, Nellie," he chided,
"when will you learn how to take care of yourself? We can't let you
go out alone any more till you grow up&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Nellie silenced him very effectively. She stood up on
tiptoe, stretched as far as possible and kissed him.</p>

<p>"That's how glad I am to see you. Smitty!" she said.</p>

<h2><a id="chapE1" name="chapE1">1. DON'T CALL THE POLICE!</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">SMITTY was away in Washington when the phone call
came in at Justice, Inc., and the other members of The Avenger's
staff were dispersed over the four parts of the world, so that only
Benson himself and Nellie Gray were on hand. The voice over the
phone was that of a child. Benson, as he answered the call,
estimated that she was barely more than nine or ten. She talked
with a Scandinavian accent in which was mingled the training of a
good English private school.</p>

<p>"Are you Mr. Benson, sir, please?" she asked anxiously. She
seemed to be hurried and perhaps frightened.</p>

<p>"Yes, my child," Richard Benson replied in a kindly voice.</p>

<p>"You are the one they call The Avenger, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>There was a tinge of sudden relief in that lost, childish voice.
"Then everything is all right. Mamma was worried and afraid that I
wouldn't be able to get you. She was afraid I might not be able to
use the American telephone. Please, Mr. Avenger, will you help my
mamma and me?"</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you must go at once to the Suydenville Hotel. Mamma is
afraid they will kill her&mdash;and me, too. Please say that you
are Mr. Foster, and ask for a message at the desk. Mamma has gone
out, but she dares not ring you up herself for fear that she is
followed. I must ring up now because those men are coming back. I
hear them in the hall." The child's voice became more hurried.
"Good-by now, and may God bless you for helping us!"</p>

<p>There was a click and the line went dead.</p>

<p>Richard Benson hung up with a frown, and looked at Nellie Gray,
Nellie was shutting off the automatic recorder, which she had
turned on at a signal from him. It had recorded the conversation, a
thing that was always done at Justice, Inc., whenever a call came
in that was out of the routine.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it, Nellie?" Benson asked.</p>

<p>Nellie Gray, slight, diminutive, was as efficient and as daring
as any of the male assistants of The Avenger. "It might be a trap,
of course, Dick!" she said thoughtfully. "Your enemies are not
above using a child to bait a death trap for you."</p>

<p>Benson shrugged and arose. He put on his hat and coat.</p>

<p>Watching him. Nellie smiled. "You'll go, of course?"</p>

<p>"Naturally. I hardly think that child could have been coached to
put on such a performance over the phone."</p>

<p>"Be sure to call in regularly. Dick," she said.</p>

<p>He nodded and went out.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later a taxi deposited him at the Suydenville Hotel,
in the East Fifties, not far from the Queensboro Bridge. It was a
neat little place, but rather old, and was patronized now almost
exclusively by a clientele of refugees from the Scandinavian
countries.</p>

<p>Benson entered and looked around swiftly. There were two or
three groups of people sitting around in the lobby, all talking
earnestly, doubtless about the war situation. No one seemed to pay
him any particular attention as he crossed to the desk, The clerk
looked up and nodded, and Benson said, "Excuse me, has anyone left
a message for Mr. Foster?"</p>

<p>"Foster?" repeated the clerk. "I'm sorry, sir, but no message
has been left for you."</p>

<p>Benson frowned. He thanked the clerk and turned away. One of the
phones in the booths at the other side of the lobby was ringing and
a bellboy answered it. The boy emerged from the booth and called
out, "Phone call for a Mr. Foster!"</p>

<p>"Right here," said Benson. He gave the boy a coin and entered
the phone booth closing the door behind him. He picked up the
receiver. "You are calling Mr. Foster?" he asked.</p>

<p>It was a woman's voice at the other end, muffled and low, and
tinged with a note of hysteria. "Thank God! I was afraid you
wouldn't come. I was afraid Hilda might not be able to get
you!"</p>

<p>"You are Hilda's mother?" Benson asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Please&mdash;every second is precious. Just to make
sure you are the right man, will you tell me your real name?"</p>

<p>"I am Richard Benson."</p>

<p>"The Avenger!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You must help me. Mr. Benson! You must help me to save Hilda!
For myself I do not care. They are following me, but I had to phone
now, or it would have been too late. Listen carefully. At exactly
nine thirty, one of their men is to be at the foot of Edge Street,
along the Marabout Creek. From there he will be guided by a
flickering flashlight. But I have arranged it so that their man
will not keep the appointment. You must be there instead. It is the
only way. But go armed and be ever watchful for a knife in the
back, for they will betray each other without
compunction&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on just a minute," Benson said. "Will you please tell me
what you're talking about? Why should I go to the foot of Edge
Street?"</p>

<p>"Didn't Hilda tell you?"</p>

<p>"No. She only asked me to come here to the Suydenville
Hotel."</p>

<p>"Then she must have been interrupted. O merciful Lord, I hope
they haven't harmed her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, madam. Whoever you are, if your daughter is in
danger I think you'd better call the police!"</p>

<p>There was a gasp of sheer terror at the other end. "I ask you,
in the name of everything you hold dear, not to bring the police
into this. You are The Avenger, the man who helps those who are in
terrible trouble, who have no more hope and no chance. If that is
so, then I ask you to help me now, and never breathe a word of this
to the police!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, madam. You're asking too much."</p>

<p>"Then...then you won't help?"</p>

<p>"Not unless you explain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"God help me, I cannot explain now. Each minute that passes is
like a drop of blood spilling from my Hilda's veins. If you will
come back to the Suydenville Hotel at midnight I will explain all,
I will tell you everything you wish to know. But now&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly, her voice ended in an agonized gasp as a crash sounded
through the receiver. Then there was silence for a moment.</p>

<p>Benson tensed, his hand tightening on the instrument.
"Hello&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a click as someone carefully hung up the
receiver at the other end.</p>

<p>Benson raised his hand to Jiggle the hook and call the police;
but he refrained, recalling the woman's passionate plea for
secrecy. Slowly, he replaced the receiver on the hook and stepped
out of the booth.</p>

<p>None of the people in the lobby seemed to be any more interested
in him now than they had been upon his arrival. He made his way out
to the street. He found a taxicab and told the driver to across the
bridge into Queens, toward Marabout Creek. It was all he could
do&mdash;to carry out the woman's request.</p>

<p>It was thirteen minutes after nine when he left the cab a block
from Edge Street and walked the rest of the way through the dimly
lit, unpopulated section out here at the God-forsaken edge of
Queens. He had hardly reached Edge Street before he spotted a
small, flickering flashlight almost a hundred yards away, along the
bank of the dank, ill-smelling Marabout Creek. He smiled grimly in
the dark. Thus far the unknown woman's arrangements were working
out with the accuracy of a timetable. He shrugged and set out after
that moving light, toward the blind appointment that had been made
for him along the dark and forbidding margin of Marabout Creek.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chapE2" name="chapE2">2. THE TATTOOED MAN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THERE were no residences here and no factories;
only a few ancient warehouses, long ago abandoned, boarded up and
crumbling with desuetude. There had been a time when the creek had
been an important waterway for barges bound for the East River; but
the creek had dried considerably over the years; and with the
development of rail and truck traffic it was abandoned now, except
for stray cats whose eyes gleamed like twin points of opal in the
dark, and for fat water rats which scampered boldly almost under
Benson's feet as he walked, following the flickering light that led
him he knew not whither.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the light ceased moving.</p>

<p>Whoever was carrying that flashlight had stopped walking. The
figure of that person&mdash;whether it was the woman who had
phoned, or someone else&mdash;was utterly indistinguishable in the
dark.</p>

<p>When that guiding light stopped, Benson stopped. It flickered
three times quickly, then went out altogether. Benson waited,
frowning, for some further signal; but there was none.</p>

<p>After a moment he moved on toward the spot where the light had
disappeared. He judged that it was about two hundred paces away,
and when he reached that place he stopped and looked about him in
the dark.</p>

<p>At this point, the creek widened somewhat and the murky waters
became deeper, for soon it would empty into the river. It was deep
enough here to accommodate small craft; and, sure enough, Benson's
eyes discerned the outline of a small cabin cruiser tied up at the
crumbling embankment. He moved over to the edge and peered down at
it. The boat was secured by a single hawser, made fast to a
stanchion on the bank. It was tied up so close that one might step
aboard without difficulty.</p>

<p>Benson frowned. He produced a small flashlight and allowed its
beam to play for a moment along the lines of the craft. He saw now
that it was no pleasure cruiser, but a ship's launch of some kind,
equipped with a small cabin. Upon the bow was painted a name: S.S.
Brunhilda, Copenhagen.</p>

<p>There was no light aboard, no sign of life or motion. It
appeared to be utterly deserted. Yet this was the only place where
the person carrying the flickering flashlight could have gone.
There was no other shelter in the immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>It might be that this was a trap; that the mysterious telephone
call was a cunning bit of bait calculated to lure Richard Benson to
his death. There were many who hated The Avenger with a deep and
abiding hatred that would grow cool only with his death; for The
Avenger's name was anathema in the slimy byways of the underworld.
And those who feared and hated him would be more likely to try to
drive a knife into his back in the dark than to face him in open
battle.</p>

<p>Benson smiled grimly and stepped off the bank, down onto the
deck of the launch, playing the flashlight before him. He stooped
at the door of the low cabin and turned the knob. It was unlocked
and it came open. He sent the beam of light lancing into the
interior and he sucked his breath in sharply at what he saw.</p>

<p>A man lay dead on the floor, in the cramped space between the
two longitudinal seats. He lay on his back with his arms
outstretched. He was naked to the waist. His face and his hairy
torso were covered with blood, for his throat had been slit from
ear to ear.</p>

<p>For sixty seconds Benson stood still and taut, listening for
sounds in the night. But there were none. Whoever had led him here,
like a will-o-the-wisp, had either gone or was hiding close by.</p>

<p>Benson's gaze swept over the cramped cabin. There was a closet
at the forward end, a brass-bound chest opposite. Both were open,
thoroughly ransacked. Papers and clothing were disarranged in
evidence of hasty search. But there was no sign of the weapon which
the killer had used.</p>

<p>The Avenger stepped into the cabin' skirting the bloody corpse.
The man had been dead for about an hour, as near as he could judge
without a careful examination. He must have been a seafaring man,
for there was an intricately tattooed design upon his chest, done
in three colors, amazingly brilliant and clear.</p>

<p>It showed up startlingly beneath the thick black hair. It was a
picture of a submarine sinking by the stern with the bow high up
out of the water. It had been done with great attention to detail,
for it showed a man with a mustache and black hair parted in the
middle' leaping from the conning tower into the water; and it
showed the number of the submarine, lettered alongside the
prow&mdash;U-777.</p>

<p>The features of the man were clearly distinguishable. The
tattooer must have been an artist of great talent for the face of
that jumping man was done with so much feeling and skill that one
might have thought he was looking at the face of the devil himself.
The face was gaunt, and the lips thin and merciless, and the man's
features were contorted into a grimace of such sheer hatred and
vicious evil as could not have been imagined to exist upon this
earth.</p>

<p>For all his vast experience with the forces of evil and crime,
Richard Benson shuddered at sight of that diabolical face, depicted
in all its depravity upon the chest of the dead sailor. He could
not understand why this murdered man, who lay here with his throat
slit, could have allowed such a hideous scene to be depicted upon
his chest. What dark and unhallowed reason had impelled him to
allow the tattooer to burn indelibly upon his flesh the record of
that devil's disciple leaping from the conning tower of a sinking
submarine?</p>

<p>At the lower right-hand corner of the tattooed design, just
above the dead man's breastbone, there appeared a small, almost
indecipherable signature, as if the artist had been desirous of
registering with posterity the record of his satanic creation.
Stooping low and holding the flashlight close, Benson read that
signature.</p>

<p class="letter" style="text-align:center">Miguel Fatuma.</p>

<p>It was at that precise moment that he heard the stealthy scrape
of a shoe upon the deck outside the cabin door.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chapE3" name="chapE3">3. TIME BOMB</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">SWIFTLY, Benson doused the flashlight, plunging
the cabin into darkness. At the same time he shifted his position,
stepping across the dead man's body to the other side.</p>

<p>He acted not a moment too soon, for something whirred through
the cabin doorway and embedded itself in the far wall with a thud.
He could not see it, of course, but he knew that it was a knife,
and that it had been aimed at the spot where he had been standing.
It had missed its mark only because Benson had acted with the
instinctive speed of a fighting man to whom danger is a familiar
neighbor.</p>

<p>Out in the darkness of the deck, someone uttered a short, sharp
curse. Then there was silence.</p>

<p>Benson's automatic was in his hand now. He stood on the balls of
his feet, ready to fire at the slightest sound. He knew that this
was to be a duel to the death in the dark, but the unknown assassin
out there had the advantage for he could wait for Benson to come
through the doorway.</p>

<p>The Avenger put out his foot and took a step toward the door.
His foot slipped in a pool of blood and he put out a hand to steady
himself against the bunk. His shoe scraped the floor, and out on
the deck a gun blasted three times in swift succession. The
assassin had switched from knife to gun. Evidently he considered it
more important to eliminate Richard Benson than to maintain
silence.</p>

<p>Benson dropped low beside the body on the floor as the slugs
smashed into the bunk close beside his head. He spotted the orange
flashes of the gun. Grimly he thrust his automatic out and pulled
the trigger. The deep thunder of his own gun mingled with the
spiteful crack of the weapon in the assassin's hand as he fired
five times, just to the right of those orange flashes. The night
was split with the dreadful threnody of the blasting guns.</p>

<p>Three times more the other fired, and then the orange flashes
ceased and the night became black. Benson couldn't tell whether he
had hit his enemy or not. But he leaped up and dashed out through
the doorway onto the deck. In the dark he hurtled against a heavy
body. The next moment he was grappling with a powerful antagonist
in a vicious, silent battle in which no quarter was given or
asked.</p>

<p>One huge bony hand seized his right wrist in a grasp of steel,
attempting to twist the automatic's muzzle upward, while a clubbed
gun in the other bony hand descended upon his head. But Benson,
well-versed in the lore of rough-and-tumble fighting, sensed his
enemy's intention and twisted away, hard. The gun butt descended
harmlessly grazing his shoulder, and the invisible assailant
grunted, but held like death to his grip on Benson's gun wrist.</p>

<p>The Avenger drove a hard left upward and his knuckles smashed
against bone, drawing another grunt. But the unknown assassin
seemed to have a jaw of iron. He came in, wrapping his arms around
Benson's supple figure in a crushing bear hug, at the same time
twisting Benson's gun arm behind his back. The Avenger countered
with a judo trick he had learned years ago in the Orient, he let
his knees buckle and his body sag, arching his spine backward. The
effect was to carry him back, down onto the deck, with the other on
top of him. Instinctively, the enemy let go his grip to put out his
hands and break the fall.</p>

<p>Benson hit the deck rolling, and his shoulder struck the other's
arm aside. The man toppled down on top of him, and Benson, already
turned around on hands and knees, caught the other's arm over his
shoulder and came to his feet with a heave. He sent the man flying
through the air, heels over head, and a dreadful shriek escaped
from the fellow as he went catapulting far over the side of the
launch into the black and murky waters alongside.</p>

<p>It was only then that Richard Benson became aware of the
presence of another craft in the creek. It was a power boat, and it
had managed to come up within ten feet without sound, only because
the engine had not been used. Instead, there were four oarsmen
stroking it, two on each side, while a fifth man held the
tiller.</p>

<p>Just as Benson glimpsed the boat a powerful searchlight flashed
blindingly from the boat, its beam sweeping past the face of the
man at the tiller, illuminating it clearly. And Benson uttered a
deep and startled gasp, for that face was the original of the face
tattooed on the chest of the murdered sailor! It was the cruel face
of the man pictured as jumping from submarine No. U-777!</p>

<p>But Benson had only a moment to realize that, for the beam of
the searchlight swung across the water where the bony-handed
assassin struggled, swimming laboriously.</p>

<p>The cruel-faced man at the tiller uttered a swift, sharp order,
and the oarsmen stroked powerfully while he veered the craft toward
the swimming man. With one hand he held the tiller, and with the
other he threw out a line which the assassin grasped.</p>

<p>Immediately, the man at the tiller shouted another order; in
response the oarsmen shipped their oars. One sprang to the engine
and whipped the crank cord, and the motor sprang into life. Two of
the oarsmen hurried to the stern and pulled in the swimming
assassin, while the fourth rose up to his feet with a machine gun
in his hand. He opened up with the rapid-firer, sweeping the deck
where Richard Benson stood.</p>

<p>But Benson, at the first sight of that machine gun, had known
what to do. He leaped off the deck of the launch, landing on the
embankment and dropping flat on his face, just as the lethal
barrage swept over him. He had lost his automatic somewhere in that
fight on the deck of the launch and he had no weapon with which to
reply to the fire from the power boat. He could only lie still,
hugging the ground, while the hot bursts searched him out. But the
power boat was fast sweeping down creek toward the river under the
propulsion of its stuttering engine. In a moment it was out of
range.</p>

<p>Whether they thought they had killed him, or whether they were
anxious to leave the scene, Benson could not tell. But suddenly the
machine-gun bursts ceased, and the searchlight was snuffed out. A
blanket of blackness descended over the creek and the embankment.
In another moment even the chugging of the engine became too faint
to hear.</p>

<p>Benson started to get to his feet, but suddenly there was a
terrific, flashing explosion, and the S.S. Brunhilda's launch
seemed to disintegrate into thin air before his very eyes. A time
bomb of some kind must have exploded in its entrails.</p>

<p>For a flashing second of time the whole of Marabout Creek seemed
to be illuminated by the very fires of hell. Bits of wood and metal
catapulted through the air, and fiery streams of flame licked out
in all directions. What was left of the hulk of the launch began to
burn with vicious intensity as the metal scraps began to rain down
from the air.</p>

<p>Benson stood up, wiping a gash on his cheek where a jagged bit
of metal had struck him. He looked with somber eyes upon the
burning wreck.</p>

<p>The murdered body of that dead seaman would never be found now,
by the police or anybody else. And the strange tattooed picture of
that cruel and evil man leaping from submarine No. U-777 would
never be seen by any other living eyes. The secret of the murder
was consumed in its own ashes.</p>

<p>Benson heard a police siren in the distance and he turned and
hurried away from that fiery holocaust. The flames sent an eerie
glow over all of Marabout Creek, and Benson swung into a side
street as quickly as he could before the police should arrive.</p>

<p>The mystery of that strange woman's phone call was now darker
than ever. There had been a time bomb aboard that launch. Had it
been meant for The Avenger? Had the whole set-up been an elaborate
trap&mdash;as Nellie Gray had feared&mdash;to lure The Avenger to
death? Benson could hardly bring himself to believe it. That little
girl's voice had been too fresh and too innocent; and the mother
had surely sounded sincerely frightened.</p>

<p>As Benson hurried in search of a cab he thought of that ghastly
tattooed picture on the dead sailor's chest; of the cruel visage of
that man, leaping from the U-777. He wondered if it could have any
connection with Hilda, or Hilda's mother, or with the murder of the
sailor. Or was it merely one of those weird coincidences, which
must be disregarded? He made a mental note of the name signed to
that gruesome work of art&mdash;Miguel Fatuma. Perhaps if he could
find the artist&mdash;</p>

<p>A police car came tearing down the street and he hugged the
wall, not wishing to be seen. After it passed he made his way again
for half a dozen blocks until he reached the subway line.</p>

<p>But even before he got there he knew that he was being
followed.</p>

<p>Benson was too old a hand at work like this to be mistaken about
such a thing. He couldn't spot the man who was tailing him, if it
was a man; but he was as sure of it as of his name.</p>

<p>He made no attempt to lose his shadow, but calmly entered a bar
and grill and stepped into the phone booth at the rear. He dialed
Liberty 1-1111, the number of Justice, Inc., and a moment later he
was listening to the buzz of the phone. It rang for sixty seconds
and there was no answer. Benson frowned. Nellie Gray must have gone
out, leaving headquarters without coverage. Only something of the
most vital importance could have induced her to do that.</p>

<p>But there was a way for Benson to find out. He hung up, got his
nickel back, and dialed Liberty 2-2222. It was the auxiliary line
at Justice, Inc., installed for just such an occasion. He let it
ring five times, then clicked down the receiver, breaking the
connection. Once more he inserted the nickel, dialed the number
over again, and let it ring seven times. He broke the connection
again, and then dialed the number a third time.</p>

<p>The five-seven ring was a code call which actuated an electric
cell installed at Justice, Inc. This electric cell broke a circuit
in the auxiliary phone, releasing a spring that raised the receiver
hook, just as if a living being had answered the phone. So that
when he dialed the number for the third time, instead of getting
the no-answer buzz, he heard the characteristic click which takes
place when a phone is answered. Then, a moment later, the voice of
Nellie Gray came to him, clearly and distinctly. It was coming off
a record-player which had been automatically put into operation
when the receiver was raised. Before leaving headquarters, Nellie
had spoken her message onto the record and left it hooked up.</p>

<p>As Benson held the receiver to his ear he heard Nellie's
voice:</p>

<p>"Dick: I have just received a phone call from a person named
Miguel Fatuma, of Thirteen Aberdeen Lane. He claims he has
important information concerning the child, Hilda, and her mother.
He was desperately urgent, and insisted that I come at once. I'll
be back as soon as possible. Good luck!"</p>

<p>The record ceased playing and there was a click as the automatic
mechanism set the receiver hook back down again.</p>

<p>Benson hung up in his phone booth with a sudden sense of
lightening peril. The name of Miguel Fatuma struck him hard like a
hammer blow. It was the name signed to that grim tattooed picture
on the murdered sailor's chest. Miguel Fatuma was the one who had
done the tattooing. But how had this Fatuma guessed that Hilda's
mother had called upon The Avenger for assistance?</p>

<p>Benson glanced at his watch. It was nineteen minutes before
eleven. At midnight he must be at the Suydenville Hotel in the hope
that Hilda's mother would be able to contact him there. In the
meantime he had planned to seek out the S.S. Brunhilda&mdash;the
ship from which the launch had come. But now he had to change his
plans and go to 13 Aberdeen Lane.</p>

<p>He glanced out through the glass panel of the booth door and saw
that a man had come into the bar while he had been phoning. The man
had not glanced at the phone booth, but had stepped up to the bar
and ordered beer. He was a stocky man with a harsh-featured, ruddy
face, and he was attired in a pea jacket and a visored cap. Upon
his sleeve there was a strand of gold braid, indicating that he was
a ship's captain.</p>

<p>Benson knew instinctively that this was the man who had followed
him from Marabout Creek. He stepped out of the phone booth and
moved down the length of the bar toward the front door. He passed
the ship's captain at the bar, but the man did not turn around.</p>

<p>Benson stepped out of the warm barroom into the frigid night, he
did not move away, but flattened himself against the wall and
waited. It was only a moment later that the sea captain came
hurrying out.</p>

<p>If he was surprised to see Dick Benson waiting here he did not
show it. In fact he did not even seem to notice him. His harsh
features did not relax as he turned up the street, moving toward
Benson and looking straight ahead.</p>

<p>But when he had just come abreast of him the ship's captain
swung, lithe as a panther, bringing his hand out of his pocket with
a small, snub-nosed pistol. He thrust the pistol at Benson's
stomach with his finger wrapped around the trigger.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chapE4" name="chapE4">4. THE GOLDEN CARGO</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE AVENGER was not unprepared for such action.
Aware that he walked constantly in the shadow of death he had
trained himself and his assistants to be ever watchful and ready
always for surprise attack. He was already side-stepping as the
seafaring man whirled, and his left hand descended, steel-strong
fingers clamping themselves around the man's wrist, and twisting it
away with a quick, powerful motion. Then he brought the edge of his
left hand down in a slicing cut upon the bone of the man's forearm,
and the ship's captain grunted and let go of the pistol. It
clattered on the pavement and lay there unheeding at their feet as
the two men faced each other, eye to eye.</p>

<p>"Damn you!" the ship's captain whispered. "I should have shot
you first. What have you and your rats done with Esther
Wagstrom?"</p>

<p>Dick Benson's eyes narrowed. "Esther Wagstrom? Would she be
Hilda's mother?"</p>

<p>"Aye, and well you know it! You and that devil you work
for&mdash;that devil, von Richter!"</p>

<p>Dick Benson's eyes narrowed. He retained his grip on the other's
wrist. "Just a minute now. What's this about von Richter?"</p>

<p>"As if you didn't know! You are one of von Richter's devils, who
have hounded Esther Wagstrom and her little Hilda over three
continents!"</p>

<p>Dick Benson drew a deep breath. "Now wait. If I let go of your
wrist will you promise to talk quietly for a minute? There's
something you and I must get straight!"</p>

<p>The other was impressed by Dick's tone of voice. "Aye, you have
my promise. But what is the good of talk&mdash;"</p>

<p>Benson let go of his wrist. "Now let's start from the beginning.
Would you care to tell me your name?"</p>

<p>The other looked disgusted. "My name? You know my name well
enough. I am Captain Helmut Walsingen, in command of the freighter
Brunhilda, out of Copenhagen!"</p>

<p>"You're docked in New York now?"</p>

<p>"At the Royal Danish Pier, on the East River."</p>

<p>"And that launch with the dead sailor&mdash;it was from your
ship?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. But why do we waste time. You know all this. Was it
not you and your fellows who murdered poor Eric Skoljes, my first
mate? Did you not set off the time bomb to destroy his body so that
the tattooed picture of von Richter would forever be
destroyed?"</p>

<p>Dick Benson studied the man keenly. Then he said slowly, "If
you're telling the truth, Captain Walsingen, then you and I need
not fight. We're on the same side."</p>

<p>The other peered at him suspiciously. "On the same side? Or the
same side with one who does von Richter's devil's work?"</p>

<p>Dick smiled. "I do not work for von Richter. My name is Benson.
Richard Benson."</p>

<p>Captain Walsingen's eyes widened. "The Avenger?"</p>

<p>Dick nodded.</p>

<p>Walsingen looked doubtful. "Esther spoke to me of The Avenger.
But I did not believe that there was such a person. It was I who
found the launch with Eric's body, and when I told Esther she said
that only The Avenger could help her. She said she would call upon
him for aid. But I did not believe in The Avenger. I went myself.
But then I saw the light which you followed to the boat, and I
thought you were one of von Richter's men, coming to destroy the
body."</p>

<p>"You saw the fight on the launch's deck?" Benson asked.</p>

<p>"I saw it. I was hiding in the shadow of the warehouse."</p>

<p>"Do you know who those people were on the power boat?"</p>

<p>Captain Walsingen pursed his lips, his keen eyes searching Dick
Benson's features. "I did not know then. But if it is true that you
are The Avenger, then those must have been von Richter's men. The
one who came aboard must have planted the bomb, for I saw him
carrying something bulky."</p>

<p>Dick Benson nodded bleakly. "And the man at the tiller was von
Richter! No wonder they hurried away so fast! They were expecting
that bomb to go off!"</p>

<p>He stooped and picked up the snub-nosed pistol. "Let's be going,
captain. We have work to do tonight!" As he was raising the pistol
his arm struck the wall of the building and there was a slight
cracking sound. "There goes my watch crystal!" he said ruefully. He
picked the bits of broken glass out of the watch, then took out his
handkerchief and wiped the face. When he was through he smiled at
the other. "I always resolve that I'll buy unbreakable crystals,
but somehow or other I like glass better."</p>

<p>Walsingen shrugged the comment off. "You Americans!" he
exclaimed. "You pay attention to odd, unimportant things when lives
are at stake!"</p>

<p>Benson smiled again. "Sometimes it's the unimportant little
things that make the difference between life and death, captain!"
He handed over the pistol, butt first.</p>

<p>"Here, captain. Take it. Where we're going tonight you'll be
needing this!"</p>

<p>Walsingen looked unbelievingly at the extended butt. "You...you
trust me with this weapon&mdash;after I tried to kill you with
it?"</p>

<p>Benson nodded. "I'm staking my life on my judgment."</p>

<p>The ship's captain blinked and put the pistol back in his
pocket. "You must indeed be The Avenger!" he whispered.</p>

<p>Benson guided the captain across the street, under the elevated
line, to a cab stand and pushed him into a taxi. "Thirteen Aberdeen
Lane," he ordered. "And stop for a minute at No. 1 Bleek
Street!"</p>

<p>On Bleek Street was the headquarters of Justice, Inc., and Dick
could get himself another gun there. He knew that before the night
was over he would have need of a weapon.</p>

<p>As the cab sped Across the Queensboro Bridge. Captain Walsingen
demanded, "Why do we go to Aberdeen Lane?"</p>

<p>"To see a tattoo artist," Dick told him. "We're going to visit
Miguel Fatuma."</p>

<p>Walsingen's eyes widened. "Fatuma! It was he who tattooed the
picture of von Richter on Eric Skolje's chest!"</p>

<p>"Why?" Benson demanded.</p>

<p>"Both Fatuma and Eric Skoljes had reason to hate von Richter.
Eric Skoljes was Esther Wagstrom's brother. She was Esther Skoljes
before she was married. Her husband was an anti-Nazi, and when the
Germans moved into Denmark he was executed with thirty others. But
he was a great shipbuilder and he had hidden a fortune in gold, and
the Germans wanted it. They tortured Esther's husband, but he would
not reveal the hiding place of the gold. It was this von Richter
who tortured him, for three days, and when Wagstrom would not speak
at the end of those three days, von Richter ordered him shot.</p>

<p>"Esther and her daughter Hilda had fled from Copenhagen with her
brother Eric, and they had taken the gold with them. They brought
it to a little seaport on the Danish coast where my vessel, the
Brunhilda, was berthed. Esther's husband owned the Brunhilda. He
had been good to me when he lived, and I was determined to help his
wife and child. I loaded the gold on board and we set sail, Eric
acting as my first mate. We cleared the Baltic before the Germans
closed it, but they learned that the gold was aboard my ship and
set their submarines to watching for us. We dared not make for an
English port for von Richter had set a cordon of submarines to cut
us off. So I sailed for Spain. We put in at Barcelona with ninety
million dollars of gold aboard, but we could not stay for von
Richter had traced us. His agents were ready to pounce on us when I
set sail again."</p>

<p>"You had ninety million dollars aboard?" Benson asked
incredulously. Walsingen nodded. "It was gold which had been
entrusted to Esther's husband by the great industrialists of
Denmark, as well as by the Bank of Copenhagen. The Nazis were
frantic to get their hands on that store of gold, for they could
have&mdash;and still can&mdash;use it in some neutral countries.
But we were determined that they should not get it."</p>

<p>"You came to New York?" Benson demanded.</p>

<p>"Not directly. We stopped first at Buenos Aires, then at
Montevideo, and later at Rio. But everywhere that we went the
devils of von Richter hounded us. We could not get landing papers,
we could not get visas. And if we had been able to land we would
have been murdered. They attempted to hold us by court actions, and
twice we slipped out of harbors just before the authorities. For
fourteen months we have sailed over the face of the earth. But at
last we have come to New York, and when we were granted permission
to enter the harbor, we thought that our troubles were over."
Captain Walsingen sighed. "But they were only beginning!"</p>

<p>Benson looked at him sympathetically. "Von Richter again?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He reached New York a day before us. What name he uses
here, I do not know. But he has men to do his killing, and money
and power. He will stop at nothing to seize hold of our gold."</p>

<p>"But what have you to fear now?" Benson asked. "In this country
you have only to go to the authorities. Tell them of von
Richter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," Walsingen interrupted. "Esther and Hilda are not quota
emigrants. They may not enter the country. If the police learn of
their presence they will be arrested."</p>

<p>"I see," said Dick Benson. "So that's why Esther didn't want me
to talk to the police!"</p>

<p>"Exactly! And von Richter knows this, too. Tonight, Eric brought
Esther and Hilda ashore in the launch, and let them off at Marabout
Creek. They went to the Suydenville Hotel, but they had no sooner
checked in than Esther realized that von Richter's men were on her
trail. They called her on the phone and told her that she must meet
them, or that a bomb would be thrown into their window. Fearful and
frightened, she had to leave her Hilda there and go to the
meeting."</p>

<p>"She must have told Hilda to phone me," Dick said.</p>

<p>"Yes, for she dared not use the telephone herself. She was
watched. But she reasoned that once she left they would not bother
about what Hilda did. They had men in the hall and Hilda was able
to phone you. This, I guess, for I do not know surely. I was on
board the Brunhilda, myself. When it became late and Eric did not
return with the launch, I went in search of him and found
&mdash;you know what!"</p>

<p>The cab had reached Bleek Street and Benson went up for a moment
and got himself a Savage .38, with an extra handful of cartridges.
He also took with him an emergency kit which looked like an
innocent platinum cigarette case, but which contained material more
concentrated and more powerful than TNT.</p>

<p>He returned to the cab and they sped east toward Aberdeen
Lane.</p>

<p>Captain Walsingen was nervous and taut. "I...I have a feeling,"
he said tensely, "that tonight we approach the end of our journey
on three continents. I am afraid that tonight we come to grips with
von Richter!"</p>

<p>"We shall see!" Dick Benson said grimly, thinking of Nellie
Gray.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chapE5" name="chapE5">5. VENGEANCE!</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">ABERDEEN LANE was an ill-smelling bit of an alley,
barely a hundred yards long, which ended up against the rotting
fence of a refuse dump which faced the East River.</p>

<p>Benson and Walsingen left the cab a block or two away and walked
the rest of the distance.</p>

<p>"See!" exclaimed Captain Walsingen. "This is quite near the
Royal Danish Pier. There! You can see the Brunhilda!" He pointed
down a side street and Benson saw the freighter, a dark hulk in the
night.</p>

<p>"And you say there's ninety million dollars of gold aboard
her?"</p>

<p>"Aye," said the captain. "My manifest reads Argentine beef. It
is not admitted to this country and I am only supposed to stop, en
route to Newfoundland. But the gold is there, and von Richter is
bound to have it. The hatches are sealed and I have a guard of ten
stalwart Danish men aboard who will fight to the death to protect
the golden cargo. But von Richter may yet get it by other means. If
he threatens Esther or Hilda, what choice will I have but to give
up the gold?"</p>

<p>They reached the mouth of Aberdeen Lane, and Benson suddenly
lost all interest in the Brunhilda; for, peering down, he
distinguished a mark on the sidewalk in the shape of a Maltese
cross. It was pointing diagonally away from Aberdeen Lane, straight
in the direction in which the Brunhilda lay at her pier!</p>

<p>Walsingen hadn't noticed that Maltese cross. It was made with
yellow chalk and it was so small that one would not have seen it
without looking for it. Benson had been looking for it because it
was part of the communication system of those associated with
Justice, Inc. It told him two things&mdash;first, that Nellie Gray
had been here and gone; second, that what he sought was not here,
but in the direction in which the stem of the cross pointed!</p>

<p>Captain Walsingen was saying eagerly, "I did not know that
Miguel Fatuma was here in New York. We met him in Buenos Aires. He
is half Greek, half Spanish. He was in Crete when the Germans took
it. There he met von Richter, who killed his mother and his sister.
He hates von Richter as much as I do. And since he was one of the
few who have seen von Richter's face, he tattooed it on Eric
Skoljes' chest. Eric wanted it that way, so that he would have a
picture of the man he hated as long as he lived."</p>

<p>They had already entered the mouth of the alley. Suddenly, Dick
Benson stopped short. He turned to look at the other. "You say your
name is Helmut Walsingen?" he asked softly.</p>

<p>The captain's hand was in the pocket of his pea jacket. He
looked queerly at Dick. "Yes. That is the name I gave you."</p>

<p>"That's queer," said Benson.</p>

<p>"Queer? What is queer?"</p>

<p>"You say that this Miguel Fatuma met von Richter in Crete. But
Crete was conquered after Denmark. Yet you told me that von Richter
has hounded you over three continents; therefore, he could not also
have been in Crete!"</p>

<p>"Ah, so!" the other said softly. "You have found the little
things in my story which do not jibe, eh? Perhaps I talked somewhat
too fast!"</p>

<p>"You did," said Benson. "You tried to twist the truth to suit
your impersonation, and you got stuck on the details. Just who are
you?"</p>

<p>The other smiled viciously. He brought his hand out of his
pocket, gripping the pistol which Dick had returned to him. "Stand
still, Mr. Avenger. In a moment you shall die! I thank you for
returning my weapon to me!"</p>

<p>"Don't mention it," Dick said dryly, looking down at the muzzle
of the gun which was pressed against his stomach. "At a guess, I'd
say that the real Captain Walsingen is that dead sailor back there
on the launch, eh? And you, You're probably a Nazi sea captain
who's been smuggled in here by submarine to take Walsingen's place.
Your job is probably to sail the Brunhilda out of here, with the
gold aboard&mdash;after von Richter captures it!"</p>

<p>"It is too bad," the other said viciously, "that a man as clever
as you must die. What you have guessed is the truth. I am Captain
Hans Mueller of the German navy. With von Richter, I landed here
yesterday from a submarine."</p>

<p>"You killed the real Walsingen." Benson accused, "and then you
set the bomb so that the picture of von Richter would be destroyed.
That was when Esther Wagstrom called me. She wanted to guide me to
that murder without revealing herself. But you were there, waiting.
You seized her while I was aboard the launch and put her on the
power boat."</p>

<p>The eyes of Hans Mueller sparkled, "Exactly, my dear Mr.
Avenger. And we have Hilda, too. And your beautiful young lady. And
tonight we sail. It was our man who phoned to your young lady.
There is no Miguel Fatuma. He was liquidated two months ago in
Buenos Aires!"</p>

<p>"So you think you're sailing with ninety millions of dollars,
eh?" Benson said. "To use to spread Nazi propaganda in South
America!"</p>

<p>"And for you, Mr. Avenger&mdash;death! Here is the end!" His
finger, curled around the trigger, contracted viciously.</p>

<p>But there was no explosion. Not even a click.</p>

<p>Mueller swore and stepped back, squeezing the trigger again.
Once more nothing happened.</p>

<p>Dick Benson chuckled. "You see, my dear Mueller, I'm not quite
the fool you took me for. When I picked up your gun I wedged a bit
of broken glass from my watch crystal under the hammer. It won't
shoot till the glass is removed!"</p>

<p>As he spoke he drew his own Savage. "You and I, my dear
Mueller," he said, "are going on board the Brunhilda!"</p>

<p>A few minutes later, two figures approached the gangplank of the
S.S. Brunhilda. In the dark it would have been difficult for anyone
to tell that the taller of the two, slightly behind the other, was
holding a Savage automatic at his companion's back. A guard at the
rail saluted and spoke in German. "Steam is up, Herr Captain. We
are ready to sail. Major von Richter instructs me to inform you
that he awaits you in the smoking lounge with the prisoners."</p>

<p>The Herr Captain Mueller only grunted and stepped past the
guard. But Dick Benson stopped for a moment and smiled pleasantly
at the fellow. "Surprise!" he said.</p>

<p>Too late, the guard's hand went to the revolver at his belt.
Benson's Savage swiped upward, the muzzle caught him under the chin
and he went down&mdash;and out.</p>

<p>Benson stepped over to Mueller. "You, too, my friend," he said.
His left fist crashed upward in a beautiful uppercut, and knuckles
thudded against bone. Mueller went backward and his skull cracked
against the deck. He lay still.</p>

<p>Grimly, Richard Benson moved aft toward the lounge. The deck was
deserted. Evidently the ship was short-handed, and the muted
throbbing from the bowels told him that the engines were going,
requiring all hands below.</p>

<p>He made his way along a companionway and found the smoking
lounge. It was a small room, probably used by the ship's officers
and the half dozen passengers they carried, in addition to freight.
Benson stopped for a moment in the doorway, gun in hand, and
surveyed the scene. Nellie Gray was sitting in a straight-backed
chair, her hands raised in the air. Beside her were a woman and a
girl of about nine, both fair-haired and blue-eyed, also with their
hands in the air. At the other side of the cabin nine seamen stood
with their faces to the wall, hands clasped over their heads.
Covering them was a single bullet-headed man with a submachine gun.
This, then, was the Danish crew of the Brunhilda, no doubt slated
for a watery death as soon as the ship cleared the river.</p>

<p>But it was not at these that Benson looked. His gaze fastened
upon the single man who stood in the center of the lounge, with a
pistol held carelessly in his hand.</p>

<p>This was von Richter! This was the man who had commanded the
power boat; this was the man whose picture had been tattooed upon
the chest of the murdered seaman!</p>

<p>Von Richter was half turned away from the doorway and he
therefore did not see Benson. But the bullet-headed man with the
machine gun saw him and uttered a sharp oath, and swung his weapon
around.</p>

<p>Grimly, Benson shot that fellow between the eyes, and the
thunder of the shot re-echoed through the cabin. Von Richter spun
around, raising his pistol; but he never had a chance to fire, for
with a roar like a cage full of angry beasts, the Danish seamen
twisted around from their positions against the wall and sprang
upon him.</p>

<p>This was their vengeance, this the chance for which they had
prayed without hope. In a split second von Richter's body was
buried under that avalanche of vengeful men. A single piercing
shriek escaped from his lips and then no more.</p>

<p>Benson hurried into the lounge and tried to push through that
throng. But by the time he reached the inner circle it was too
late. The body of von Richter was not a pretty thing to look
upon.</p>

<p>The leader of the Danes seized Benson's hand and wrung it hard.
Then he snatched up a machine gun and called to the others. "Come!
We will take care of the rest of the Germans!"</p>

<p>Benson didn't stop them. He turned to Nellie Gray, who patted
his arm, "Always on schedule, Dick! Did you see my mark?"</p>

<p>He nodded. "How did you manage to get it on the sidewalk?"</p>

<p>"I pretended to trip as they led me here. It only took a second
to make the Maltese cross." She turned to the woman and the little
girl, "This is Esther Wagstrom and Hilda. They're millionaires,
Dick, many times over. There's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ninety million dollars in the hold!" Benson finished for her,
smiling.</p>

<p>"But how did you know?"</p>

<p>He winked. "I got it from the enemy."</p>

<p>There were sounds of scuffling outside and a few shouts, but no
shots. Nellie shuddered. "I hate to think what's happening to those
Nazi seamen!"</p>

<p>"And I," exclaimed Esther Wagstrom, "shudder to think what is
happening to my countrymen. Our king is no longer able to protect
them from the brutality of the Nazis!"</p>

<p>Benson patted Hilda's glorious golden hair as he led her out of
the lounge, keeping between her and the body of von Richter. Out on
deck, the Danish seamen lined up and their captain stepped forward.
"We must sail tonight for, otherwise, the authorities will hold us
and interne our gold."</p>

<p>"But your gold will be restored to you after the war," Benson
objected.</p>

<p>The captain smiled bitterly. "We do not care for the gold
itself. It is the things that the gold makes it possible for us to
do. In Europe we have many friends. Our gold will set up
underground agencies will pay for arms and secret newspapers and
propaganda. We will spend every dollar of it to bring nearer the
day when we can be free of Nazi tyranny!"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said The Avenger. "I should report this to the
police, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no!" Esther Wagstrom begged. "Give us our chance to fight
the Nazis!"</p>

<p>Benson sighed. He glanced at Nellie Gray, whose eyes were
shining and eager. "Let them go, Dick!" she whispered.</p>

<p>Richard Benson nodded. He took Nellie's arm and led her down the
gangplank.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, the S.S. Brunhilda was moving down the
river. Thanks to Nazi efficiency, her papers were all in order, her
sailing arranged for through forged documents. No one would stop
her on the way down the bay.</p>

<p>As the ship moved off, Esther and her daughter waved from the
bridge. And a low cheer broke from the Danish seamen. A voice
called out, "We will meet again, Avenger&mdash;when our people are
free. Till then, God bless and keep you!"</p>

<p>Nellie's hand was tight upon Dick Benson's arm, her eyes moist.
"God bless and keep you all!" she whispered.</p>

</h2>

<h3>First published in <i>The Shadow</i> magazine, August 1944</h3>

<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">DICK BENSON turned into Chatham Street from
Summer, and a woman in a window somewhere above him screamed, "Look
out!"</p>

<p>Reacting instinctively to that high-pitched shriek of warning,
Benson threw himself forward and to the right, landing up against
the building wall, just as something struck the pavement with a
ghastly, sickening plop.</p>

<p>Benson was on his feet instantly. A single glance was enough to
tell him what it was that had come hurtling down from above. It was
not a pretty thing to see the crushed body of the man lying in
ghastly stillness upon the sidewalk. Benson wiped a bit of blood
from his spattered cheek. His face was grim and hard as he leaped
out to the curb and turned his gaze upward.</p>

<p>The woman who had screamed the warning to him was lying limp
across the windowsill of a second&mdash;story room in a dead faint.
Above her, the cheap hotel rose for five more stories. The windows
in the entire line from which the man's body might have come were
dark. There was no way of telling from which one he had fallen. It
might even have been the roof.</p>

<p>A buzzing crowd of shocked spectators had already gathered
around the grisly body, and a patrolman was pushing through. For
the moment, Benson was forgotten. He edged away from the fringe of
the crowd, and made for the entrance of the hotel.</p>

<p>Several people had come running out of the lobby, white-faced
and trembling. One of them stopped Benson, "Who was it?"</p>

<p>Benson shrugged. "If he has no papers on him, it'll be hard to
tell!" he disengaged himself from the man's shaky grip, and pushed
through the fly-specked door into the hotel lobby. His eyes were
bleak, his lips tight. If his hunch was right, he knew very well
who that dead man was. But he didn't intend to impart that
knowledge to anyone&mdash;just yet.</p>

<p>Within the lobby, the desk was deserted. The clerk must have
been one of those who had run out. Benson turned grimly toward the
elevators. One cage was down, but there was no operator. He, too,
must have hurried out into the street. Benson shrugged, and started
to enter the cage.</p>

<p>But just then, he heard the swift patter of feet on the stairs,
and a girl appeared, stumbling down, clutching at the railing with
one hand and holding together a flimsy negligee with the other.
There was blood on her face coming from a cut on the side of her
head. Her short, dark hair was clotted with it, and there was more
upon the front of the negligee. Her eyes were wild and glassy, and
her lower lip was trembling.</p>

<p>She stumbled on the last step, and settled in a frightened heap
on the floor. She let her head drop on one arm. "Murder!" she
gasped. "He murdered my father! He pushed him out the window. Then
he tried to kill me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dick Benson was already hurrying toward her, when a gust of air
flowed through the lobby as the door was pushed open, and the
patrolman entered. "Here, what's this&mdash;"</p>

<p>Benson was stooping beside the girl, and the patrolman came
running over. He looked suspiciously at Benson. "Who is she?"</p>

<p>"The dead man's daughter, I think," Benson told him.</p>

<p>The girl lifted up her head and repeated her accusation.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" gasped the patrolman. He took the girl's arm. "You
poor little thing! Just tell us who did it, and we'll get him. Who
pushed your father out the window? Who tried to kill you?"</p>

<p>The girl's frightened sobs were still racking her body. She
turned her head and looked at Benson. She thrust her finger out at
him, accusingly. "He did! He's the one who pushed my father out the
window!"</p>

<p>"Now just a minute, my child," said Dick Benson. "Get hold of
yourself. You don't know what you're saying." He threw a side
glance at the patrolman and said to him, "The girl is
hysterical&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hysterical, is it?" growled the patrolman. "Maybe she is, and
maybe she isn't. But don't you move!" He pulled out his service
revolver and covered Benson. "Stand away from that girl, and keep
your hands where I can see them!"</p>

<p>He called over his shoulder to the mob which had surged in from
the street: "One of you, please call the station house. Tell the
sergeant I've got a murderer here!"</p>

<p>"Don't be a blithering idiot!" Benson said angrily. "I just came
in off the street. I couldn't have killed her father. And while
you're wasting time here, the real murderer is making his
escape!"</p>

<p>The hotel clerk was already telephoning to the precinct house,
and the crowd was jabbering excitedly, casting nasty glances at
Benson. Some one said, "We ought to lynch the dirty murderer!"</p>

<p>Benson turned to the girl, who was still huddled on the floor.
"Look here! You're Elsa Hammond. I'm Richard Benson. I had an
appointment with your father for eight o'clock this evening. I was
just coming to keep that appointment, when it happened&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no!" the girl exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You had already come. You came into the room, and I saw you. I
was right there. I saw your face, and I remember your clothes. Even
that green necktie. You were supposed to help my father. You're
Richard Benson&mdash;the detective. Dad called you for
help&mdash;and you murdered him!"</p>

<p>The patrolman began to look puzzled. "A detective?" he said.
"Are you a detective?"</p>

<p>Benson nodded. "Matthew Hammond&mdash;this girl's
father&mdash;phoned me this afternoon. He had gotten hold of some
information which might mean his death. He didn't dare to leave the
hotel. He asked me to come here this evening, after dark. But some
one else must have got to him first&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not someone else," Elsa Hammond said stubbornly. "You! You came
in and talked to dad for five minutes, while I sat in the corner
reading. Then you suddenly jumped up and took out a gun and hit dad
on the head, and pushed him out the window. Then you jumped for me,
and you hit me with the gun, but it only grazed my head. I
screamed, and ran into the next room and locked the door, and you
went out. When I heard the door slam, I came out in the hall and
ran downstairs. When I got down here, you were right where you're
standing now. You must have come down just ahead of me!"</p>

<p>Frowning, Benson studied the girl. She was about eighteen. There
was a strange air of unsophisticated innocence about her which did
not jibe with the deadly lie she was telling. It was hard to guess
whether she really believed the lie, or whether she had been
coached by one of Benson's many enemies.</p>

<p>It was a ghastly thing to think that she could act so&mdash;with
her father's crushed body lying on the pavement outside!</p>

<p>But in the meantime, the real murderer of Matthew Hammond must
have made good his escape through the back entrance. The killer
would surely not have remained in the hotel. There would be no use
in searching the place now. Benson shrugged, and resigned himself
to await the arrival of the homicide men.</p>

<p>They had not long to wait. Within a very few minutes, a small,
tight knot of men pushed in through the crowded lobby. At their
head was Captain Dolson.</p>

<p>Dolson knew Dick Benson very well. He frowned when he saw that
the patrolman was covering Benson with the revolver. "What's this,
McClure?" he demanded. "Don't tell me that Mr. Benson is your
murderer."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Patrolman McClure said. "This girl here accuses
him!"</p>

<p>It took just a few moments after the lobby had been cleared for
Captain Dolson to get the girl's story. When she finished, he
looked at Benson. "Can you clear yourself easily enough?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. I think so. All I need to do is prove that I was in
the street when the body landed. It would have hit me if a woman
upstairs hadn't screamed a warning. She was leaning out of the
second-floor window. We can go up there, and she can tell you that
she saw me in the street."</p>

<p>"Let's go up," said the captain.</p>

<p>He motioned to one of the plain-clothesmen and the three of them
entered the elevator. As they ascended, Dolson said, "What was this
information that Hammond wanted to give you?"</p>

<p>There was a faraway look in Dick Benson's eyes. "It was about a
dead man," he said.</p>

<p>"A dead man!" Dolson exclaimed. "You mean, about some one else
who was murdered?"</p>

<p>"No. It was about a man named Egon Black."</p>

<p>"Egon Black! That was the chap you ran down, about a year
ago&mdash;the fellow who operated the Death Syndicate!"</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"It was you who caught him. You turned him over to the police,
and he escaped. He had a powerful organization, and he was able to
obtain a plane for his escape. But the plane crashed, and he was
burned to death in the wreck."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Benson.</p>

<p>"But what could Hammond have had to tell you? What kind of
information could Hammond have had which might mean his death?"</p>

<p>"He told me that Egon Black was still alive!"</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>Benson shrugged. "That's what I thought, too. But Hammond gave
me certain details&mdash;details which were known to nobody but
Egon Black and to my agency."</p>

<p>"And you came here believing that Egon Black was still
alive?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know. I came to find out. Now, after seeing Hammond's
body, I'm inclined to believe it."</p>

<p>They had reached the second floor, and they made their way down
the corridor to the door of the front room from which the woman had
screamed her warning. The hotel clerk, who had accompanied them,
said, "The lady who lives here is a Mrs. Linton. She's been here a
couple of weeks."</p>

<p>Dolson nodded, rapping at the door. "All we'll need, Mr. Benson,
is her statement that she saw you in the street when the body fell.
That should clear you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He frowned, rapping a second time. "Funny she doesn't answer.
She must know we'll want to question her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She fainted when the body hit," Benson said. "Maybe she hasn't
come out of it yet." He glanced at the clerk. "Better open the
door."</p>

<p>The clerk nodded nervously, and produced his passkey. In a
moment they were pushing into the room.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the woman's body was lying against the window, with
her head on the sill.</p>

<p>"That's a long time to be in a faint!" said Dolson. He stepped
over to her, saying to the clerk, "Get some water,
please&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he stopped short, looking down at her. "Never mind the
water," he said in a queer voice.</p>

<p>Dick Benson felt a sudden, cold chill in his veins. He moved
over alongside the captain. And he saw what Dolson was looking
at.</p>

<p>The woman was dead. There was a small, clean bullet wound in her
right temple. She hadn't fainted at all. She had been shot from
across the street, probably with a silenced rifle!</p>

<p>"Well," said Captain Dolson, "that sort of puts a hole in your
alibi!" He was just a mite less cordial than before. There was a
growing glimmer of suspicion in his eyes.</p>

<p>Benson frowned, looking down at the body of the woman. "Poor
thing," he said. "She was an innocent victim. It was her misfortune
to be looking out of the window when Hammond's body fell. She must
have been shot when she screamed the warning to me."</p>

<p>"Shot?" Dolson repeated. "By whom?"</p>

<p>"By one of Egon Black's men."</p>

<p>"Why? Why should they want to kill her?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see? They wanted to remove any alibi I might
have."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that this Egon Black&mdash;granting that
he's still alive&mdash;planned to frame you for Hammond's
murder?"</p>

<p>"Maybe he didn't plan it in advance," Benson said thoughtfully.
"Maybe that marksman was stationed across the street to pick me off
when I got here. But then, when Hammond's body came hurtling down
just at that minute, the sniper must have thought fast. He must
have figured that I'd hurry into the hotel, and that Elsa would
accuse me of the murder&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now wait," the homicide captain said. "How would that sniper
know that Elsa was going to accuse you of the murder?" He was
openly suspicious now. "The only way Elsa Hammond could accuse you
of the murder, was if she saw you do it."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Benson. "She saw me do it."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;who&mdash;?" Dolson began to splutter. "First, you
say you were in the street; then, you say Elsa saw you murder her
father&mdash;"</p>

<p>Benson smiled grimly. "She thinks she saw me do it. The man who
murdered her father must have been made up to look like me!"</p>

<p>"You're crazy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Egon Black must have learned of my appointment with Hammond. He
may have listened in on the telephone conversation. So he got one
of his men to make up like me, and came five minutes earlier. Don't
forget that Hammond had never met me in person, so the deception
would be fairly easy. The object, of course, was to get Hammond to
reveal his information to the impostor, and then to kill him.
That's just what they did. They were going to kill me, too, in the
street; but when the body fell out of the window just at that
moment, they decided to try framing me for the murder."</p>

<p>Captain Dolson was far from being convinced. "That's a lot of
theory, Mr. Benson; but I'm sorry to say that it's not evidence.
The only evidence we have so far is Elsa Hammond's statement that
you murdered her father."</p>

<p>"Let's go downstairs," Benson said. "There were several people
from the lobby who met me in the street right after Hammond's body
struck. Perhaps they can identify me."</p>

<p>But downstairs in the lobby, the breaks were once more against
Richard Benson. The only one who could remember having stopped
someone to ask what had happened, was the hotel clerk, and he only
looked hazily at Benson. He said:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, but I can't say if this was the man or not. With the
dim-out and all, it's pretty dark out there in the street, and my
eyes were blinded by coming out of the lighted lobby. Besides, I
was too excited to notice the man's face. In fact, I don't think it
was this man at all!"</p>

<p>Elsa Hammond was seated in one of the easy chairs, under the
care of a police matron. She pointed a shaking finger at Benson and
exclaimed, "Don't let him talk his way out of this. He's the
murderer! He killed my dad!" Then she buried her face in her arms
and began to sob all over again.</p>

<p>Captain Dolson's face was hard and grim. "Richard Henry Benson,"
he said, "I arrest you on the charge of wilful murder. I warn you
that anything you say may be used against you!"</p>

<p>Dick Benson smiled bitterly. Against the damning identification
by Elsa Hammond he could advance only a guess. To clear himself, he
must produce the real murderer&mdash;Egon Black.</p>

<p>But he had only the whispered hint from a murdered man that Egon
Black was still alive. Legally, Egon Black was dead. So, in order
to prove his own innocence&mdash;he had to find a dead man!</p>

<p>But before he could do that, he must free himself. As a
prisoner, held for the grand jury on a charge of murder, he would
have no chance at all to find Egon Black.</p>

<p>"Come along," Captain Dolson said, taking his arm and motioning
for the detectives to close in around them. "We'll go down to the
district attorney's office&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was at that precise moment that Nellie Gray entered the
lobby.</p>

<p>Nellie Gray was small and blond and pretty and demure. She
looked no older than a high-school senior. But in her case, looks
were deceiving. Behind that wide-eyed innocence of hers, there was
a mind as trigger-keen as that of any hard-bitten fighting man; and
the training which Benson had given her as his assistant had
equipped her to hold her own&mdash;and more&mdash;in any kind of
battle.</p>

<p>In the lobby, everyone was so engrossed with the drama of the
arrest, that no one noticed her appearance; no one, that is, except
Benson himself.</p>

<p>Benson's eyes flickered. He shook his head almost imperceptibly,
and Nellie took the hint. She ducked around behind one of the easy
chairs, where she was completely hidden from view.</p>

<p>Benson allowed Captain Dolson to lead him by the arm toward the
door. Dolson called back to the matron, "Bring Elsa Hammond along,
Mrs. Merkle. We'll take her downtown with us. The D.A. will want to
get a written statement from her, to hold Benson on."</p>

<p>Benson went out into the street with him, and Dolson led the way
to a police sedan at the curb. The two detectives with them kept
close on either side of Benson, each with a hand on his arm; and
the matron followed, with Elsa Hammond. Dolson opened the door of
the car, and motioned for his prisoner to step in. As soon as
Benson was inside, he nodded to Elsa Hammond, who also stepped into
the car. Benson sat tautly on the edge of the seat, his muscles
tight, as if waiting for something to happen. Dolson started to
enter the car. He put his foot on the running board.</p>

<p>And as if that had been a signal of some sort, four sharp pistol
shots sounded, coming from inside the hotel lobby, in quick,
spiteful succession. They were immediately followed by a girl's
high-pitched scream, filled with what sounded convincingly like
agony and terror. Immediately after the scream, there came
terrified words: "Help! Murder! Police&mdash;"</p>

<p>The last word was drowned by two more sharp pistol reports.</p>

<p>Benson sat quite still beside the frightened Elsa Hammond,
suppressing a smile. He recognized the voice, of course, as that of
Nellie Gray. She was doing an excellent bit of histrionics, with
the assistance of her automatic as a sort of orchestration.</p>

<p>Captain Dolson and the detectives were galvanized into frantic
action. Snatching out their revolvers, they swung about and rushed
back into the hotel, momentarily forgetting about their
prisoner.</p>

<p>Benson sat still, watching them for the two seconds it took them
to barge through the door into the lobby. Then he chuckled, reached
across Elsa Hammond and pulled the door shut.</p>

<p>Elsa looked at him with large, frightened eyes. "What&mdash;what
are you going to do?"</p>

<p>Benson did not answer. He swung his legs over the top of the
front seat, and slid in behind the driver's wheel. He turned the
ignition key, yanked the starter button and shifted into first. He
thrust down on the accelerator and let up on the clutch, and the
car leaped away from the curb like a hunted antelope.</p>

<p>Elsa Hammond had opened her mouth to scream, but she was jarred
back into the seat, and the breath jolted out of her body.</p>

<p>Benson turned the corner on two wheels, sent the car whistling
down the side street and turned the next corner to the right,
coming into the street at the rear of the hotel.</p>

<p>He braked down to ten miles, peering into the darkness of the
dimmed-out street, and spotted the slender figure of Nellie Gray
coming out through the back entrance on the run. He blinked his
lights twice, and she headed for the car, wrenched the door open
and sprang inside.</p>

<p>"Nice timing, Dick!" she gasped, as she sprawled over against
the frightened Elsa Hammond.</p>

<p>Benson smiled tightly, and stepped on the gas and the car shot
away, just as Dolson and his two detectives came racing out of the
hotel. But by that time, Benson was already turning the next
corner, and the shots they sent after him went wild.</p>

<p>Benson raced two blocks more, then turned another corner, and
slowed up a bit. He glanced over his shoulder and said, "Nice
timing to you, too, Nellie. You worked it perfectly!"</p>

<p>Nellie gave him a demure smile. "It worked beautifully. As soon
as I did my screaming and shooting act, I scrammed past the clerk
and out the back way. For a minute I was afraid you wouldn't think
of the back door."</p>

<p>Elsa Hammond had stopped her sobbing. She started to get up,
shouting, "Let me out of here&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nellie Gray wrapped strong, competent fingers around the girl's
arm. "Take it easy, sister," she said. "You're coming with us. And
no place else!"</p>

<p>Elsa tried to struggle, but Nellie got her in a deft arm-lock.
"Stay put, sister. You little fool, you're among friends!"</p>

<p>The girl suddenly wilted, and gave way to sobs. "Y-you'll k-kill
me&mdash;the way you k-killed my f-fa-ther&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," said Nellie. She thrust the girl back into a corner
of the seat, and calmly proceeded to insert fresh cartridges in the
clip of her automatic.</p>

<p>"Where are we heading for, Dick?" she asked. "This car will be
awful hot in five minutes, when they get it on the short wave."</p>

<p>"The first thing we've got to do," Benson said, "is to get to
some quiet place where we can talk to our guest, here, and convince
her that I didn't murder her father."</p>

<p>"Never!" exclaimed Elsa Hammond. "You'll never convince me. I
saw you! I saw you with my own eyes!"</p>

<p>"And the next thing," Benson went on imperturbably, as he drove
north, "is to find Egon Black."</p>

<p>"Egon Black!" Nellie Gray repeated. "How are we going to find a
dead man?"</p>

<p>Benson chuckled. "Maybe it'll be easier than you think. Take a
look out the rear window at that taxi cab. It's been tailing us
ever since we left the hotel. I think that perhaps Mr. Egon Black
is going to assist us to find him!"</p>

<p>Nellie Gray glanced behind at the shrouded headlights of the
taxi which was tailing them. It remained about two hundred feet
behind them, slowing when they did, and speeding up when Benson
stepped harder on the gas.</p>

<p>"Well," said Nellie, "we can't go anywhere till we lose
them."</p>

<p>"We don't want to lose them," Benson told her. "In fact, I'm
more anxious to keep contact than they are. That taxicab is our
only hope of ever finding Egon Black. Elsa's father told me very
little over the phone. He was a disbarred lawyer. At one time, he
used to handle legal matters for Egon Black, and he was disbarred
after we broke up Black's death syndicate. If you recall, Egon
Black used to insure men for large sums of money payable to some
phony charity, and then they would die shortly afterward. When
Black was finally caught&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean, when you caught him!" Nellie interrupted. "If it
hadn't been for you, Egon Black would have gone on forever with his
death syndicate!"</p>

<p>Benson waved that aside. "It was known that Black had made
several millions out of his murder scheme, but the money was never
found. It was thought that the secret of its whereabouts had
perished with Egon Black in the crash of that plane. But Hammond
phoned me tonight out of a clear sky that Egon Black was still
alive. He said that Black had contacted him, because he needed
Hammond's help in getting to the hidden money."</p>

<p>"But did he explain how it was that a dead man was still alive?"
Nellie asked, peering out through the back window, with her pistol
ready, in case the cab should speed up to overtake them.</p>

<p>Benson nodded. "Yes. Hammond said that Black had a fellow named
Dimitroff in his gang, who had once been an actor. Dimitroff made
up some stooge to look like Black, and it was the stooge who went
aboard the plane in Black's place. It was the stooge who died when
the plane crashed. The body was so badly burned that it was
unidentifiable, but several people at the airport identified
pictures of Egon Black as the man who had boarded the
plane&mdash;so the police marked Black down as dead."</p>

<p>"I see," said Nellie. "And it must have been this Dimitroff who
made up the impostor who came to Hammond's room tonight, posing as
you!"</p>

<p>"Exactly! It seems from what Hammond told me on the phone, that
Black had hidden the money under the planking of a cabin cruiser he
had owned, but which had been registered in Hammond's name. At the
time, Hammond didn't know that the money was there. Black lay low
for two years after the plane crash, and he had just now contacted
Hammond. He wanted to know where the cabin cruiser was tied up.
Hammond was cagey, and refused to tell him until Black divulged the
reason why he wanted to know. Hammond stalled him off, and phoned
me."</p>

<p>Benson glanced into the rear-view mirror, then went on:</p>

<p>"He had been earning an honest living for the last two years,
trying to live down his disgrace for the sake of Elsa, here. He
didn't want to become involved with Black again, but at the same
time he was afraid to go to the police. That's why he called me,
and made the appointment for tonight. He must have told that
impostor where the cabin cruiser is located, and it was then that
the murderer killed him. They didn't want him to reveal that Egon
Black is still alive!"</p>

<p>Elsa Hammond had been listening carefully to everything Benson
said. She, too, was glancing nervously behind, at the pursuing
taxicab. Now she asked shakily, "W-why are they following us? If
you really aren't the one who murdered my dad&mdash;and if you're
telling the truth about someone else posing as you&mdash;then why
are they still after us? Dad told that man where the boat was tied
up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Benson. His hands tightened on the wheel as he drove.
"And it was right after your father told him, that he pulled his
gun and struck him?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then don't you see why they're following us? They've got to
kill both you and me&mdash;and Nellie, too, for that matter.
They're going after the money hidden in the cabin cruiser&mdash;but
they also have to make sure that no one remains alive who knows
that Egon Black isn't dead!"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then those men in the taxicab intend to kill
us?"</p>

<p>"Of course they do. And they're taking their own sweet time
about it, because they know I'm wanted for murder, and that I don't
dare seek help from the police!"</p>

<p>Elsa Hammond's eyes were wide, and her lower lip was trembling.
She appeared to be still unconvinced that Benson wasn't the one who
had killed her father.</p>

<p>But Nellie Gray put a hand on her arm. "You must trust us, my
dear," she said softly. "Your life&mdash;the lives of all of
us&mdash;may depend on your trusting us."</p>

<p>Elsa uttered a choked sob. "I&mdash;I don't know what to think
anymore!"</p>

<p>Benson continued to tool the car north, peering constantly in
the rear-vision mirror.</p>

<p>Nellie Gray patted Elsa's shoulder. "You see, my dear, Mr.
Benson didn't kill your father. You must believe that.
You&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly, Nellie broke off, uttering a cry of warning. "The cab
is closing up on us, Dick!"</p>

<p>Benson had seen it, too. The cab had spurted ahead, cutting the
intervening distance in half. They had reached a secluded portion
of the East River Drive, and there were few other cars in sight.
The road just ahead was clear of traffic for the moment, and the
killers in the cab were going to take advantage of the
opportunity.</p>

<p>The taxi gained on them with a rush now, and Nellie Gray
exclaimed, "They're going to pass us, Dick! And there's a machine
gun poking out of the window!"</p>

<p>Benson's hands remained steady on the wheel, and he did not
accelerate, nor did he try to swerve in either direction. The cab
came hurtling abreast of them, and the face of the man behind the
machine gun was clearly visible. Elsa, in spite of her fright,
uttered a gasp. "That face! It&mdash;it's the same as Mr.
Benson's!"</p>

<p>Indeed, the face of the man who peered at them over the ugly
muzzle of the machine gun was almost a replica of Benson's. This
then, was the murderer who had impersonated Benson.</p>

<p>It was evident that the fellow was holding his fire until the
very last moment, when the cab would be pulling ahead of the police
sedan, so that he could rake the occupants with his first
burst.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" Benson shouted over his shoulder to Nellie and Elsa.
He kept the pace steady, his hands hard on the wheel, his eyes
glued on the cab. He gauged his timing with uncanny accuracy. He
waited until the cab was just barely about to pull ahead. That was
the moment when the gunner chose to pull the trip of his machine
gun. But it was also the moment when Dick Benson stepped down hard
on the brake!</p>

<p>The sedan rocked to a grinding stand-still, as if it had come up
against an invisible and impassable barrier. The cab slid ahead,
just as the first burst of lead spat from the muzzle of the machine
gun.</p>

<p>But the gunner had been calculating without the sedan's stopping
short. His burst was directed at the spot where the sedan should
have been in the next split second. But it wasn't there, and the
zinging bullets smashed through empty air only inches ahead of the
sedan's radiator.</p>

<p>The cab, which had been traveling much faster than Benson's
sedan; rolled on for perhaps thirty feet before the driver braked
frantically to a stop, while the gunner leaned far out of the
window and swung the muzzle of his machine gun around to bear on
the sedan.</p>

<p>But by that time, Dick Benson had ripped open the door and was
out in the road with an automatic in his hand. He ran forward
shooting, straight toward the cab, his slugs smashing into the face
of the machine-gunner. The man's countenance disintegrated under
the impact of those bullets, and the machine gun fell back off the
window ledge, into the cab.</p>

<p>Someone inside the cab uttered a shout, and the driver set the
taxi in motion once more. It pulled away swiftly from Benson.</p>

<p>He held his fire, sending no more shots after it. There was not
a second to waste now, not even for a single shot. For he knew that
the shooting would bring radio cars converging upon the
spot&mdash;radio cars which must already have received orders to
capture him. He swung around and called to Nellie and Elsa:</p>

<p>"Follow me!"</p>

<p>Nellie sprang out of the sedan, dragging Elsa after her by the
hand. The frightened girl made no further objection now, as they
followed Benson across the road and into the obscure shadows of a
side street. The sight of that impostor's face in the cab must have
convinced as nothing else could have done, that someone other than
Dick Benson had murdered her father.</p>

<p>Just as they reached the shelter of a doorway, a squad car came
screaming down the street, and swung into the Drive. The policemen
piled out with guns in their hands, and advanced upon the
sedan.</p>

<p>But Benson did not wait to see their disappointment at finding
it abandoned. He broke out of cover and led the way down the street
at a lope, away from the Drive, with the two girls following him.
At Second Avenue he slowed to a walk, and said to Nellie, "You and
Elsa cross the street and walk parallel with me. They'll be looking
for the three of us together. We'll stand a better chance of
getting through if we separate."</p>

<p>Nellie nodded and took Elsa's arm. "Let's go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" said Elsa Hammond. She came up close to Benson. There
was no longer any fear in her eyes. "I was a fool," she said. "I
know, now, that you never killed my father. Lets go to the police.
I'll tell them it wasn't you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Benson shook his head. "It's no good, Elsa. You can only tell
them what you saw. And no matter what you believe at this moment,
the fact remains that you saw a man who looked like me murder your
father."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but isn't there any way we can prove&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Prove that someone else killed him? Yes. By finding the body of
that machine-gunner I just shot. By exhibiting his body, with the
face&mdash;what's left of it&mdash;made up like mine. The only
trouble is, that there won't be much left of that face. I put four
bullet into it!"</p>

<p>"Then there isn't any way?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the only way is to produce Egon Black. I don't think
he was in that cab. I think he must have left others to do this
work, while he, himself, went to the cabin cruiser to retrieve the
hidden money. If we only knew where the boat is tied up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I know!" Elsa Hammond said quickly. "I was there when dad
told that impostor&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nellie seized hold of Elsa's shoulder. "Talk, kid&mdash;and
quick!"</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it's at Follan's Pier, at City Island. Dad never used
it after Black's crash in the plane. He tried to sell it, but the
market for pleasure boats was dead, and it was too small for war
use&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind the rest!" Dick Benson said hurriedly. "We've got to
get up there before Egon Black leaves. If we miss him, we'll never
find him again!"</p>

<p>He swung into Second Avenue, and Nellie said, "Hadn't we better
separate&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he shook his head. "No time for caution. Every minute counts
now. We've got to take chances!"</p>

<p>He found a cab parked at a hack stand at the next corner, and he
hurried the girls into it. "City Island!" he said to the cab
driver.</p>

<p>Just as they got started, a second police car came racing up
Second Avenue, made a right turn directly in front of them, and
disappeared down the side street heading for the Drive. The two
policemen in it didn't even glance toward the occupants of the
taxi.</p>

<p>"Gee," said the taxi driver. "There must have been a shooting
over on the Drive. That's the second police car that's hightailed
over there."</p>

<p>"A shooting?" Dick Benson said in a horrified voice. "How
terrible! Isn't there enough shooting going on all over the
world?"</p>

<p>He leaned forward and passed a twenty-dollar bill to the driver.
"It's very important that we reach City Island quickly. I know
there are rules against driving fast in the dimout, but if you'll
break them tonight, I'll pay any fine, and give you a hundred
dollars more if we reach City Island in thirty-five minutes."</p>

<p>"Brother," said the driver, "consider yourself there!"</p>

<p>The long stretch of water front at City Island was as black as
the nethermost pit. If the dimout was bad in the city proper, it
was much more drastic here, close to the shore. They left the cab
about five hundred feet from Follan's Pier, and Benson gave the
driver the promised hundred dollars, telling him to wait for a
possible return ride.</p>

<p>Fortunately, both Benson and Nellie Gray were familiar with City
Island, for Benson had once kept a boat here which they had used
for emergency runs up the Sound. They walked swiftly but
soundlessly along the shore, past darkened piers cluttered with
gear, and with the saltwater spray whipping their faces. As they
walked, Benson reloaded his gun.</p>

<p>"Keep about ten feet behind us," he whispered to Elsa Hammond.
"If that cab full of gunmen has come here, there may be a lively
few minutes!"</p>

<p>As they came close to Follan's Pier, Nellie pointed excitedly to
a tiny pin point of light from a boat which was tied up close to
the dock. It emanated from a crack in a cabin window.</p>

<p>Benson tapped Nellie on the shoulder, for they dared not speak
now, even in a whisper. He motioned for her to cover him, and she
nodded in swift understanding, and dropped back a couple of paces.
It was so dark here that they could not even see Elsa Hammond, who
had remained behind, in obedience to Benson's order.</p>

<p>Benson moved forward as silently as a cat, and stepped out onto
the pier. But he had hardly taken a step before a figure rose
suddenly out of the darkness, thrusting a gun into his face.</p>

<p>"This is it, Benson&mdash;"</p>

<p>Benson acted even before the man finished. His pistol came up
hard, cracking against the underside of the man's wrist, driving
his gun muzzle up. The weapon exploded in the air, shattering the
stillness of the water front. Benson swiped sideways with the
barrel of his gun, catching the man in the temple. The gun struck
with a thud, and the fellow crumpled and went down.</p>

<p>The door of the cabin was thrust violently open, and at the same
time the light inside was doused. A gun barked six times in quick
succession, and bullets swept the pier where Benson had been
standing. But Benson had already leaped to the deck of the boat.
The thud of his landing was drowned by the blasting of the gun.</p>

<p>The man who had fired grunted, and said to someone behind him,
"Give me the flashlight, Egon. I think I got him."</p>

<p>Benson smiled tightly. He stepped around the deck on his
soft-soled shoes, and swung into the doorway, smashing down with
his gun barrel. He struck bone, and there was a horrible crunching
sound, and the man gasped and fell forward. Benson caught his
collar and pulled him out on the deck, and let his limp figure sag
to the planking.</p>

<p>Inside the cabin, Egon Black cursed softly. "Are you out there,
Benson?" he called.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Benson. "I'm here."</p>

<p>"Are you alone?"</p>

<p>"I'm alone on the deck of this boat."</p>

<p>"I have three million dollars in here, Benson. I'll split it
with you."</p>

<p>Benson laughed harshly. "I'm coming in after you, Egon
Black!"</p>

<p>"All right!" screamed Black. "I've tried to get you killed a
dozen times. But this time, I won't fail. I'll kill you this time.
Nothing will stop me now&mdash;with three million dollars!"</p>

<p>A machine gun began to clatter inside the cabin, and a hail of
slugs swept out through the cabin door. Benson crouched, waiting
until the first burst was over. Then his legs straightened.
Powerful muscles sent him hurtling in through that door-way, his
pistol spitting lead as he fanned it around the interior of the
cabin.</p>

<p>He expected another hail of lead from the machine gun, and
dropped flat on the floor, with his gun empty. He lay still in the
pitch-blackness, waiting for some sound to tell him whether he had
missed, or whether he had got his man.</p>

<p>At last, there came a faint scraping sound; a foot dragging
against the floor. Then, the wheezing breath of a wounded man.
Benson knew he had hit Egon Black, but hadn't killed him. His own
gun was empty now. He lay quiet, waiting.</p>

<p>A moment later, a flashlight winked on, the beam traveling
upward. Benson saw Egon Black. He was on the floor, with his legs
stretched out in front of him, and blood oozed from a wound in his
side. Black had the flashlight in one hand, and the machine gun
cradled under the other arm, with his finger on the trigger. He
swung the beam of the light around to center upon Benson.</p>

<p>Benson pushed up, and got to his feet, the flashlight sticking
to him like glue.</p>

<p>Egon Black's face was a mask of hatred. "I'm not done yet, you
cheap snooper. I'm going to give it to you now!" He raised the
snout of the machine gun so that it centered upon Benson's stomach.
"A belly full of hot lead, Benson! How do you like the idea? Here
goes&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a single, spiteful crack from somewhere outside.
Something whined past Benson's ear, and a small round hole
miraculously appeared in Egon Black's forehead. His body twitched,
and the machine gun jerked upward. A single short burst spattered
into the ceiling as his dead finger contracted upon the trip, and
then the gun dropped to the floor as his body slumped over.</p>

<p>Nellie Gray hurried into the cabin, breathless. Benson turned
and nodded to her. "That was nice shooting, Nellie," he said. "But
I was afraid you were going to wait too long."</p>

<p>"I had to make sure," she gasped. Benson stooped and picked up
the flashlight from the cabin floor. He directed it first at a
trunk near the wall, which stood with the lid up, and the keys in
the lock. It was filled almost to the brim with money of all
denominations, jammed into it helter-skelter.</p>

<p>"That's what Egon Black did murder for," he said.</p>

<p>"And look what it got him!" Nellie whispered.</p>

<p>Benson swung the flashlight around to cover the body of a man
which had been dumped onto one of the bunks. It was a ghastly thing
to see, for there was little left of the face. Nellie turned away,
sick.</p>

<p>"That's the fellow I shot," Benson said. "The one who
impersonated me. I think there'll be enough of the makeup left to
convince Captain Dolson, don't you?"</p>

<p>He swung toward the door as a light step sounded on the deck.
Elsa Hammond appeared in the doorway, her eyes two great pools of
horror in a white and ghastly face. She saw Benson and Nellie Gray
alive and unharmed, and her whole body seemed to relax. "Oh!
I&mdash;I thought you'd both been killed!" Her gaze went to the
body of Egon Black, with the hole in his forehead showing up like a
black badge of dishonor.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I see you found the dead man!"</p>

<p>Benson smiled bitterly. "Yes. And this time he'll stay
dead!"</p>
