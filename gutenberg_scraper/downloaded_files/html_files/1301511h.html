<p class="blurb">In the dead of night Marty Quade was
awakened&mdash;by two guns trained on his head. Marty was about to
be shot for being involved in a case he hadn't heard of&mdash;yet.
But Marty was in too much of a hurry to die just then, so he
composed a bullet rhapsody&mdash;for a corpse parade.</p>

<h2><a id="chap1" name="chap1">CHAPTER 1</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE Japanese gentleman was very apologetic. He
stood in the doorway of Marty Quade's hotel room, with a flashlight
in one hand and a small twenty-two calibre pistol in the other.
Right behind him there was a second Japanese gentleman, who had no
flashlight, but who made no effort to hide the gun in his hand.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry to intrude, Mr. Quade," said the first Japanese
gentleman, speaking very politely and in precise English. "Believe
me, it is very necessary."</p>

<p>Marty sat up in bed and blinked at the two uninvited guests. The
hair on his chest glistened in the beam of the flashlight. He slept
only in his pajama pants, and the upper part of his body felt
chilly in the cold draft which the open door was causing.</p>

<p>"What the hell do you want?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The first Japanese gentleman stepped farther into the room. His
companion, right in back of him, felt for the electric light
switch, and flicked it on. The light from the ceiling lamp revealed
them both to be faultlessly attired in evening clothes, with white
tie, stiff shirt-front, handsome dark topcoats, and opera hats.</p>

<p>The second of the two closed the door carefully, and
double-locked it. Then the first one put away his flashlight and
advanced toward the bed. Keeping the pistol pointed at Marty, he
showed two gleaming rows of false teeth in a smile that was
supposed to be dazzlingly genial.</p>

<p>"Please do nothing rash, Mr. Quade," he begged. "I am aware of
your reputation for toughness. But believe me, if you should get
out of bed, we would be compelled to kill you at once."</p>

<p>Marty looked at them soberly for a moment, then he began to
grin. He propped himself up on one elbow, keeping the blankets over
him. His other hand was under the blanket, gripping the thirty-two
calibre automatic which he had picked up from the night table when
he had been awakened by the fumbling at his door.</p>

<p>"Come right in," he invited. "Make yourselves at home,
Mister&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hito," supplied the first Japanese gentleman. "Matsuma Hito.
And this"&mdash;he waved at his companion, who blinked owlishly
from behind a pair of horn-rimmed glasses&mdash;"is my assistant,
Mr. Nugo."</p>

<p>"And what's the idea, Mr. Hito," Marty Quade demanded, "of
breaking into my room at three o'clock in the morning?"</p>

<p>"We did not break in, Mr. Quade," Hito protested gently. "We
merely opened the door with a passkey."</p>

<p>"Where did you get the passkey?"</p>

<p>Mr. Hito smiled once more and raised one shoulder slightly.
"From the night clerk. The poor fellow saw fit to try to resist,
and Mr. Nugo was regretfully compelled to kill him. We have put his
body in the vault."</p>

<p>MARTY'S fingers curled around the butt of the automatic under
the blanket. His eyes narrowed. Mr. Hito was certainly not
bluffing. His calm statement about murdering the night clerk had
been made too matter-of-factly.</p>

<p>"If you wanted to get in here," Marty said, "why didn't you just
knock instead of going to the trouble of killing the night
clerk?"</p>

<p>Mr. Hito smiled deprecatingly. "We hoped to catch
you&mdash;napping, so to speak. We wanted no trouble with you, Mr.
Quade. We thought it wiser to talk with you&mdash;with the
advantage on our side."</p>

<p>To illustrate what he meant by "having the advantage on his
side," he thrust his pistol a little closer to Marty's bare
chest.</p>

<p>"Go ahead and talk," Marty said. "But don't expect that little
pop-gun of yours to do you any good. I've been shown bigger guns
than that."</p>

<p>Mr. Nugo, who had come around to the foot of the bed, snickered.
But Mr. Hito remained very grave. "I have been warned that you are
a dangerous man, Mr. Quade. That is why we took such precautions
tonight. I do not think that we will have any trouble with
you."</p>

<p>"Get down to business," Marty said impatiently.</p>

<p>Mr. Hito removed his top hat, flattened it carefully, using only
one hand, and then sat down in the chair near the bed. He put the
hat in his lap and held the pistol over it.</p>

<p>"You are a very unconventional private detective, Mr. Quade," he
began. "You have no office, and you transact all your business from
your hotel room here, or from any bar where you may happen to be.
In this manner, you are always within reach of any client who has
immediate and pressing need of your services. Perhaps one reason
for operating in this peculiar way is that you have clients in so
many different and out-of-the-way walks of life."</p>

<p>"Look, Mr. Hito," Marty said in an exasperated voice. "For the
sake of saving time, you can assume that I know as much about
myself as you do. Skip the biography and get down to the bare
facts. I want to get some sleep tonight."</p>

<p>Mr. Hito smiled. "Have no fear, Mr. Quade. You shall sleep well,
tonight. Very well indeed."</p>

<p>Mr. Nugo snickered again.</p>

<p>"I see," said Marty. "Curtains for me, eh?"</p>

<p>Hito shrugged deprecatingly. "No one dislikes bloodshed more
than I do. But in your case, there is no other way."</p>

<p>"In plain English then, you're here to knock me off?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Unfortunately, yes. My humble apologies, but we must kill
you in a few minutes."</p>

<p>"Why in a few minutes? Why not right now?"</p>

<p>"You do not understand, Mr. Quade. We are waiting for the
telephone call."</p>

<p>"Telephone call? From whom?"</p>

<p>"From Andrew Gaxton."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Marty. "Andrew Gaxton! But what has he got to do with
all this. He's a writer of crime stories. And besides, he's in
Mexico City&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, Mr. Quade. Andrew Gaxton arrived in New York
by plane only a few minutes ago. We are quite sure that his first
action will be to call you. He will ask you to meet him at once and
act as his bodyguard. He has the utmost confidence in your ability
to protect him, Mr. Quade."</p>

<p>"Thanks for the compliment," Marty said sourly. "But what's he
afraid of?"</p>

<p>"Of me!" Mr. Hito said, with a show of becoming modesty. "He
knows that I plan to&mdash;er&mdash;eliminate him, unless he
complies with certain requests of mine. When he phones you, I shall
let you answer. Then I shall take the phone, and inform him that I
am here. I shall let him hear the shot which
will&mdash;ah&mdash;deprive you of your life. When he understands
that I have killed the one man upon whom he relied for safety, he
will quickly come to terms with me."</p>

<p>Mr. Hito smiled, as if in appreciation of his own
cleverness.</p>

<p>"You amaze me," Marty said. "You positively amaze me."</p>

<p>"Thank you," acknowledged Mr. Hito. "I always try to do a piece
of work thoroughly. It is my profession."</p>

<p>"You mean you're a professional murderer?"</p>

<p>"No, no. I, Mister Quade, am a&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Hito had no opportunity to say what he was, for the
telephone on the night table rang.</p>

<p>Mr. Hito smiled, and bobbed his head. He waved toward the
instrument with his pistol.</p>

<p>"Answer, please!"</p>

<p>A QUEER sort of tenseness seemed to take possession of both Mr.
Hito and his assistant, Mr. Nugo. Nugo's breath left his lips in a
sibilant hiss, and he leaned over a little, across the foot of the
bed. His eyes, behind the horn-rimmed glasses, actually grew wider.
The pistol in his hand moved forward, and the veins began to stand
out on his skinny yellow hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Hito, however, remained outwardly calm, except for an almost
imperceptible hunching of the right shoulder.</p>

<p>Marty pushed himself back in the bed, so that he rested against
the headboard. He still kept his right hand under the blanket. With
his left he reached out and removed the telephone from its cradle.
He raised it and said:</p>

<p>"Quade speaking. How are you, Gaxton?"</p>

<p>There was a gasp at the other end of the wire. Then a voice
said: "Marty! How did you know it was I?"</p>

<p>Marty Quade chuckled. "A little bird. In fact, two little birds.
The name of one is Mr. Hito, and the name of the other is Mr. Nugo.
They're here to kill me, so as to put a scare into you."</p>

<p>"Holy Moses!" Andrew Gaxton groaned. "I should have known better
than to drag you into this. I could kick myself for having boasted,
down in Mexico City, that my friend Quade would take care of me
once I got to the States. You're as good as dead, Marty, and I am
lost. That Hito is worse than a rattlesnake!"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," said Marty. "Mr. Hito is easy to get along with.
I'll take five to one that I buy you a cup of coffee at the lunch
counter downstairs&mdash;in a half hour."</p>

<p>Mr. Hito and Mr. Nugo, who had been watching and listening very
carefully, now exchanged glances. Mr. Hito nodded, and reached over
and took the phone out of Marty's hand. He put the speaker to his
mouth and said:</p>

<p>"Do not accept the wager, Mr. Gaxton. It is impossible to
collect from a dead man. Listen closely now, and you will hear the
shot&mdash;"</p>

<p>He nodded to Mr. Nugo, who snicked the safety catch off his
pistol and thrust the gun all the way forward to bring the muzzle
nearer to Marty.</p>

<p>Marty sighed, and took his own automatic out from under the
blanket. The safety catch had been off all the time, and all Marty
had to do was to pull the trigger.</p>

<p>He did so, and the gun cracked.</p>

<p>A big, round hole appeared in the center of the triangle formed
by Mr. Nugo's eyes and the top of his forehead. Mr. Nugo let the
pistol drop out of his hand. It fell to the bed. His horn-rimmed
glasses fell off his nose. Then Mr. Nugo, looking quite bewildered,
toppled forward. Blood spattered the white sheet. Mr. Nugo lay
still. The reverberating echoes of Marty's shot bounced back from
the four walls like the rumbling of a metal drum.</p>

<p>Mr. Hito was taken entirely by surprise. He had remained seated
alongside the bed, with his opera hat in his lap, and the pistol
held above it.</p>

<p>But he had been so sure that Mr. Nugo would be capable of
handling the simple matter of murder, that he had devoted his
entire attention to turning the phone in such a manner that it
would catch the full blast of the revolver shot. Marty's swift and
unexpected action had caught him flat-footed.</p>

<p>For a fraction of a second he certainly did not realize what had
actually happened. Then, as Nugo fell across the bed, Mr. Hito
uttered a sibilant sound and lifted his gun.</p>

<p>But Marty Quade was already swinging the automatic around. He
could have shot Mr. Hito through the head, just as he had shot
Nugo. And perhaps he later had occasion to regret that he had not
done so. But instead of shooting, Marty merely struck down at Mr.
Hito's wrist with the barrel of the automatic.</p>

<p>The sound of metal striking against bone was drowned out by the
still-reverberating echoes of the gunshot. But the feel of it was
very satisfactory to Marty. The barrel thudded solidly against
Hito's wrist, and the Japanese gentleman opened up his fingers and
dropped his pistol, as if it were white hot.</p>

<p>For a second he looked with uncomprehending eyes at the dead
body of Nugo, and at Marty's grinning face. Then he jumped up from
the chair, spilling his opera hat and dropping the phone. He
turned, crouched low, and dashed for the door. He twisted the
catch, and yanked the door wide open.</p>

<p>"Hey, you!" Marty yelled. "Stand still, or I'll
shoot&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Hito threw himself flat on the floor, wriggled forward a
foot or two into the hall, and then rolled out of the line of
fire.</p>

<p>Marty swore under his breath, threw the blankets off, and leaped
out of bed. Clad only in his pajama pants, he dashed out after Mr.
Hito.</p>

<p>HE SWUNG out into the hall and stopped still, his face going a
brick red. Mr. Hito was already far down the end of the corridor,
near the fire exit. But there was some one else, less than ten feet
away, coming toward the door.</p>

<p>She was a black-haired, black-eyed beauty, with a short fur
jacket and a pair of blazing emerald pendants in her ears. A red
silk dress swished around her long legs and clung to her narrow
hips like cellophane.</p>

<p>But it wasn't her legs or her dress or her earrings or her hips
that Marty was noticing at that moment. He was noticing the heavy
black Luger which she was holding in one slender hand.</p>

<p>Besides noticing that Luger, Marty was also supremely conscious
of his own lack of clothing. He uttered a gasp, and turned and
dived back into his room.</p>

<p>But the black-haired girl came after him relentlessly, and
started shooting. She was a terrible shot, and the bullets went
everywhere except in Marty's direction.</p>

<p>The Luger was entirely too heavy for her, and the recoil threw
her aim wild. The gun boomed four times before Marty got inside the
room, and then he took another step and tripped over something. It
was the body of the dead Mr. Nugo, which had rolled off the bed and
was lying on the floor on its face, directly in Marty's path.</p>

<p>Marty went down head first, and his temple struck a glancing
blow against the baseboard of the bed. It knocked him groggy for a
second, and he lay still, his hands outstretched, one paw still
gripping the automatic.</p>

<p>He heard the black-haired girl fire two more shots behind him.
One slug hit the bed, and the other plowed into the floor almost a
foot from his head.</p>

<p>She was certainly the rottenest shot who had ever popped a gun
off at Marty Quade. But she must have thought that she had hit him,
for he heard her say with a strong Spanish accent:</p>

<p>"Let that be wan lesson to you, peeg. I, Esperanza Torres, 'ave
keel you, weeth my own 'and!"</p>

<p>Then he heard her light footsteps swiftly retreating down the
hall.</p>

<p>Marty wiped sweat from his forehead, shook his head to free it
from dizziness, and got to his feet. He grabbed his robe lying on a
chair, flung it around him quickly, then sprang to the door.</p>

<p>The Se&ntilde;orita Esperanza Torres was just disappearing
through the same fire-door through which Mr. Matsuma Hito had made
his exit a few moments ago. There was a flutter of her red dress,
and then the fire-door closed behind her.</p>

<p>Marty started to give chase, and then realized that half a dozen
doors in the corridor were open, and that people were peering out
at him.</p>

<p>He swore under his breath, and gave up in disgust. He turned and
went back into his room, shut the door behind him. Then, picking up
the phone which Hito had dropped, he said:</p>

<p>"Gaxton! Hello, Gaxton!"</p>

<p>There was no answer. Marty scowled, and tried again. Still no
answer. Then the hotel telephone operator cut in.</p>

<p>"Is there anything I can do for you, Mr. Quade?"</p>

<p>"What happened to the call I had on here?" he' demanded.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir. Perhaps you were disconnected. Do you know
the number? Perhaps I could call them for you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know the number."</p>

<p>"Then maybe the party will phone back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid they won't!" he mumbled.</p>

<p>"What's that, sir?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Listen&mdash;have you seen the desk clerk down
there?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. That's very funny. I just rang the desk clerk to get
the list of morning calls, but there was no answer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right," Marty said wearily. "Maybe you better phone down to
police headquarters. Get hold of Inspector Hanson of Homicide. Tell
him to come right over."</p>

<p>"Homicide! Did you say homicide, Mr. Quade?"</p>

<p>"Homicide."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but that means murder. Is&mdash;is there some one
dead?"</p>

<p>Marty threw a jaundiced glance at the body of Mr. Nugo. "If he
isn't dead," he growled, "he's giving the best imitation of it that
I ever saw!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap2" name="chap2">CHAPTER 2</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AT SIX-THIRTY that morning, Marty Quade was
downstairs in the hotel restaurant, having coffee and ham-and-eggs
with Inspector Hanson. The room upstairs was cleaned up, but there
was a uniformed policeman on guard. Chalk marks on the floor
indicated where Mr. Nugo's body had lain, and there was fingerprint
dusting powder all over the place, and on the halls and stairways
of the hotel.</p>

<p>Needless to say, Marty had not gotten back to bed that night.
And Inspector Hanson was still firing questions at him, in between
mouthfuls of ham and eggs.</p>

<p>"Damn it, Quade," he growled, "you say this Spanish dame fired
at you six times, and we've found all six slugs. But it just
doesn't sound reasonable that she should have missed you that many
times at such close range!"</p>

<p>"All right, all right!" Marty snapped. "We'll do a re-take of it
and have her hit me next time. Just get the dame back, and we'll
give her another chance."</p>

<p>"Now don't get tough, Quade," Hanson barked. "I'm just trying to
get a straight story, and I don't think you're giving me everything
you know. We've checked with Pan-American, and they have no one by
the name of Gaxton on their passenger list on the clipper last
night. That was the only airliner that made connections with Mexico
City. It's the only ship Andrew Gaxton could have arrived on. But
they haven't got him down&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maybe he used an alias. He was afraid of being knocked off.
Maybe he tried to conceal his arrival by booking passage under
another name."</p>

<p>"We're checking on that," Hanson told him. "There were nineteen
passengers on the plane, and we've located eighteen of them. The
nineteenth, a chap named Smith, didn't come in on the regular bus.
He took a cab, and the porter heard him tell the driver to go to
the Beverly Hotel, but no one registered there by that
name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Smith, eh?" Marty interrupted. "I suppose it never occurred to
you that it might be Gaxton?"</p>

<p>"Sure it did!" Hanson growled. "But we haven't proved it. There
are plenty of men whose real name is Smith. Every time you see a
guy who calls himself Smith, it doesn't mean that he's traveling
under an alias."</p>

<p>"All right, skip it," Marty snapped. "What about Mr. Hito? Did
he disappear off the face of the earth, too?"</p>

<p>Hanson shrugged helplessly, "We've picked up a hundred and
sixteen Japs for questioning in the last two hours. You've been
down to headquarters and looked them over, and none of them is Mr.
Hito. I'm beginning to think there never was a Mr. Hito, or a
Spanish dame, or a call from Andrew Gaxton. I think you made it all
up, to cover something else you're trying to hide from me."</p>

<p>"What about the telephone operator?" Marty pointed out. "She
told you there was a call at three ten&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure. But it might have been from anyone. She didn't listen in.
We've checked back on that call, and it came from an all-night drug
store in Long Island City, which fits in all right, because
Gaxton&mdash;or whoever he was&mdash;could have stopped off on the
way from LaGuardia Airport to make the call. But that doesn't prove
it was Gaxton."</p>

<p>"So?" Marty asked.</p>

<p>"So," Hanson finished, "you're still not out of the woods,
Quade. If it turns out&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hanson stopped talking abruptly, his face going a dull red. He
had been talking so loud and forcefully that his voice had been
drowning out the voice of the newscaster, coming over the radio at
the cashier's desk.</p>

<p>But just then a few of the announcer's words penetrated to their
ears through Hanson's bellowing, and it was that which had caused
him to shut up. The announcer was saying:</p>

<p>"...body has been identified as that of Andrew Gaxton, the noted
writer of crime stories, who has been in Mexico investigating Fifth
Column activities for a series of articles he was preparing.</p>

<p>"The taxicab apparently went out of control when a bullet fired
from a high-powered rifle pierced the windshield and struck the
taxi driver in the head. The cab was speeding across Queensboro
Bridge at the time. It went wild, struck one of the steel girders,
and immediately burst into flame.</p>

<p>"Fire-fighting apparatus from Welfare Island, in the middle of
the river, immediately below the bridge, were rushed up by the
elevator which connects the island with the bridge, but it was too
late. When the taxicab driver and Andrew Gaxton were removed from
the smouldering wreckage, they were burned to cinders.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gaxton was identified by a leather wallet which he must
have been holding at the moment of the accident, and which was
thrown from his hand, out of the car window on to the bridge
roadbed. It will be recalled that Andrew Gaxton recently announced
that he would return soon from Mexico City with information on
Fifth Column activities there which would be dynamite..."</p>

<p>Marty Quade's face was grim and tight as he listened to the
radio announcement.</p>

<p>"So," he said softly, "They got him, after all!"</p>

<p>"Hell!" Hanson swore. "I should have been notified. It's a
homicide&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a waiter who came to the table.</p>

<p>"Inspector Hanson?" the waiter asked. "You're wanted on the
phone, sir. It's police headquarters."</p>

<p>Hanson nodded brusquely and got up. "That's the desk sergeant
calling to report," he grumbled. "It's a wonder they wouldn't move
a little faster. Don't go away, Quade. I got plenty to ask you
yet."</p>

<p>HE WENT toward the phone booths, and Marty waited only until he
was out of sight. Then he got up from the table, leaving the check
for Hanson to pay, and hurried out the back exit of the restaurant,
passing through the kitchen.</p>

<p>The night cook, a Greek by the name of Ulysses Macropulos, had
his arms elbow-deep in a pie batter. He looked up and recognized
Marty, and grinned broadly.</p>

<p>"Halloo, Mistair Ku-vade. I hearing dat you gatting caught
oopstairs by does woman, vid half your pajamas on, hah?"</p>

<p>"Nuts," said Marty. "I never sleep in a coat. That's why I grow
hair on my chest."</p>

<p>"Hah!" said Ulysses Macropolos. "Vat you do if dere is fire,
hah?"</p>

<p>"Listen, Ulysses," Marty growled. "I got caught in worse than a
fire last night." He passed the cook's table and got to the back
door, which opened into an alley alongside the hotel. "Do me a
favor, Ulysses, will you?"</p>

<p>The cook grinned, and winked. "Sure. I knowing w'at you wants.
W'en dose cop come, I ain't seeing you. I catch wise, hah?"</p>

<p>"Good boy, Ulysses," Marty praised. "That's the idea. You do me
this favor, and I promise to taste your meatballs and spaghetti
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"You promise? Hah! I making special for you tonight. But don't
gatting you'self keel today."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best," Marty told him, and slipped out into the
alley.</p>

<p>He made his way along the alley and stepped out into the street,
trying to look as nonchalant as possible. Hanson's police car was
at the curb in front of the hotel entrance, and behind it was
parked a small station wagon belonging to the homicide division, in
which they carried their fingerprint and photographic
paraphernalia. But there were no police in evidence out here.</p>

<p>Marty turned west toward Eighth Avenue. He threw a quick glance
across the street, and his lips tightened. A small, wiry man had
come out of the lunchroom directly opposite, and he began to pace
Marty, keeping just a little behind, but remaining on the other
side of the street. After that first quick glance, Marty didn't
look again, but he had seen enough. The man was Japanese.</p>

<p>Marty kept walking steadily west, though he felt prickles along
his spine. Those Japs had got to Andrew Gaxton swiftly and
terribly. Now the only reason they could have for shadowing Marty
Quade would be for the purpose of completing the task which Mr.
Hito had left unfinished last night&mdash;that simple little job of
murder. If Quade were taken out of the picture now, it would leave
no one to testify against Mr. Hito.</p>

<p>At this unholy hour of the morning, there were only a few people
out, all men, obviously early commuters, and laborers.</p>

<p>Marty slowed up, so that the man on the other side of the street
was almost abreast of him. The man made no move to slacken his
pace, but continued on, past Marty. But a little farther on, he
stopped and looked in a store window displaying women's
lingerie.</p>

<p>Marty grinned thinly, and continued on. He couldn't afford to
lose too much time here, because Hanson would be coming out after
him very soon now. But neither could he afford to let that Jap get
behind him.</p>

<p>Just then, a taxicab which had been cruising slowly down the
street, pulled up alongside Marty. Some one leaned out of the
window and said: "Ps-st!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap3" name="chap3">CHAPTER 3</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BY INSTINCT, Marty's hand streaked to his shoulder
holster as he whirled. But he let the gun slide back when he saw
whose face was framed in the open window of the cab. In fact, he
almost slid through the sidewalk himself. For the face in the
window was none other than that of Andrew Gaxton, the man who had
just been reported murdered over the radio.</p>

<p>Gaxton had a round, cherubic face, and immense ears. He also had
a flabby extra chin, which was jellying now, in his excitement. He
thrust open the door of the cab and croaked: "Jump in, Quade.
Quick, for Heaven's sake!"</p>

<p>Marty glanced across the street at the Jap. The wiry little
fellow was still admiring the ladies' lingerie.</p>

<p>Marty stepped into the cab and pulled the door closed without
slamming it.</p>

<p>"Get going!" he said to the driver, and then he dropped to the
floor, crouching on hands and knees. "Pull that hat down over your
face!" he commanded Gaxton. "And look natural. Keep your eyes
straight ahead!"</p>

<p>Andrew Gaxton obeyed mechanically. "But&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>From where he crouched, almost at Gaxton's feet, Marty couldn't
see a thing out on the street. "Take a gander across the way," he
ordered, "and tell me if that Jap over there is wise to where I
disappeared."</p>

<p>Gaxton looked, and exclaimed: "Oh, Lord! You didn't fool him,
Quade. He's running toward us, and he has a gun out. He'll kill us
both."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" Marty said, and poked his head up, sliding out his
automatic at the same time.</p>

<p>The Jap had already reached the cab, and jumped on the running
board. He was poking his gun in through the window, and Marty came
up, his face only inches from the muzzle. The Jap grinned
triumphantly and pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The gun thundered. Flame belched from the muzzle, and a slug
whipped out. But Marty's hand had come up at the same time as his
head&mdash;the hand which held the automatic.</p>

<p>His automatic struck the barrel of the Jap's gun, driving it
upward, and the slug instead of ploughing through Marty Quade's
face, slapped into the roof of the cab, burying itself in the
upholstery.</p>

<p>The Jap never got a chance to fire a second shot, because Marty
smiled at him sweetly, and lunged with the muzzle of the automatic,
driving it smack into the fellow's chin. It cut a gash an inch and
a half long from the point of his jaw up to his lower lip. And it
drove his head far back. The Jap gurgled, let go his hold on the
window frame. He went toppling off the running board and rolled
away, limply.</p>

<p>Marty swung to the cab driver, who had automatically stepped on
the brake.</p>

<p>"Keep going, my friend," Marty said. He emphasized his point by
touching the cold muzzle of the automatic to the back of the man's
neck.</p>

<p>The driver got the point all right. He took his foot off the
brake and put it on the gas. They shot ahead to the corner like a
projectile out of a cannon's mouth, and crossed Eighth Avenue
against the red light without losing an iota of their speed. At
Ninth Avenue Marty said:</p>

<p>"Turn right, my friend, and go uptown."</p>

<p>At the next corner Marty took the muzzle from the driver's neck.
"All right," he said. "You can stop here."</p>

<p>They got out, and Marty smiled winningly at the driver. "You did
us quite a favor, my friend."</p>

<p>"L-listen, m-mister," the cabby stuttered. "I d-don't w-want
n-no t-trouble&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No trouble at all," Marty told him, "as long as you keep mum
about us." He turned to Gaxton and said: "Give him some money."</p>

<p>Andrew Gaxton nodded eagerly and pulled out a roll of bills
which was so fat that he had difficulty holding it. He peeled off
two twenties, handed them to the driver.</p>

<p>"You better forget you had us for a fare," Marty warned.</p>

<p>"M-mister," the driver said, "I'm b-blind and d-deaf and
d-dumb&mdash;"</p>

<p>"S-swell!" said Marty. And then he snapped his fingers in
disgust. "Oh, hell! I'm doing it too! Get going!"</p>

<p>They watched the cab disappear up Ninth Avenue, and then Marty
took Andrew Gaxton by the arm and hurried him down the side street,
back to Eighth.</p>

<p>Gaxton tried to hold back. "We can't go right back, Quade. The
police will be looking for us."</p>

<p>"Not at Eighth Avenue, they won't," Marty told him. "They'll
figure we're miles away."</p>

<p>"But where can we hide? I don't dare let the police get their
hands on me!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" Marty demanded. "Look, Gaxton, if you've committed
murder, I'll have no part of you. I'm in Dutch with Hanson
already."</p>

<p>"No, no, Quade. It&mdash;it's nothing like that. But if the
police get hold of me, they'll grill me. I can't take it, and I'll
talk. And if I talk, then Esperanza's brother, Juan, will get
boiled alive in a vat of oil&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whoa up!" Marty exclaimed. "You're running the film too fast.
Did you say Esperanza? Is it Esperanza Torres, by any chance?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I've met the young lady."</p>

<p>"You have! Good Lord, Quade, you couldn't. She's in Mexico
City."</p>

<p>"Nuts," said Marty. "She talked to me right in my room, this
morning."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what did she say?"</p>

<p>"She said: 'Let that be a lesson to you, you peeg!' I'll never
forget those words, Gaxton!"</p>

<p>"I don't understand," the writer murmured. "I left her in Mexico
City yesterday." He looked up suddenly, and blurted: "Quade, we're
almost at Eighth Avenue! I daren't take the chance."</p>

<p>"We're not going any further," Marty told him. "Here's where we
turn in."</p>

<p>He steered him into the entrance of a seedy looking hotel which
sported the name ARGUS on a hanging speckled sign over the
doorway.</p>

<p>"This is where you hole up."</p>

<p>Reluctantly, Gaxton permitted himself to be steered over to the
desk. There was a large sign on the wall which said,</p>
<br>

<p class="sign">ALL RENT PAYABLE IN ADVANCE<br>
NO CHECKS<br>
ROOMS RENTED BY THE DAY MUST BE<br>
VACATED BEFORE THREE P.M.<br>
PRICE LIST<br>
Inside Room &mdash; 60c<br>
Outside Room &mdash; 75c<br>

<br>

<p class="first">THE clerk at the desk looked up from a racing
sheet when they came in. He grunted: "Hullo, Quade. Been a year
since I seen you last."</p>

<p>Marty nodded. "Give us one of your broken-down rooms, Oliver. On
the top floor, next to the fire escape."</p>

<p>Oliver nodded, and reached for a key. "Room seventeen. You want
it with, or without?"</p>

<p>"With," said Marty.</p>

<p>"That'll be fifty fish," Oliver told him.</p>

<p>Marty glanced at Gaxton. "Give him fifty bucks."</p>

<p>"Fifty dollars!" Gaxton exclaimed. "That's outrageous. And
what's this about with or without? I don't feel in the mood
for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take it easy," Marty said. "We're just getting a room with
silence. If the cops inquire about you, silence will be the
watchword. Is that worth fifty bucks to you? Or isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Gaxton. "I see."</p>

<p>He took out his roll and counted fifty dollars on the
counter.</p>

<p>Oliver took the money nonchalantly and stuffed it in his pants'
pocket. Then he came around the desk, led them to the elevator and
said: "Step in, gents."</p>

<p>The old cage creaked miserably on the way up, and Gaxton
fidgeted nervously. At the seventh floor they got out. Oliver gave
them the key.</p>

<p>"To the right, at the end of the hall," he said. "The fire
escape is right at the hall window, next to your door. If anything
comes up, I'll ring the hall bell three times. That'll be your
signal to scram."</p>

<p>Marty nodded and led Gaxton down the corridor. He opened the
door of Room Seventeen, and they went in. There was a single old
bed, a dresser without a mirror, and a table with a pitcher of
water and one glass. There was no chair in the room, and no closet.
A cord tacked to the wall had two coat hangars attached to it. The
bulb in the ceiling light was twenty-five watts, to discourage late
reading.</p>

<p>"Holy Moses," Gaxton said, "is this where we must spend the
day?"</p>

<p>"You must," Marty told him. "Sit down."</p>

<p>He fairly pushed him on to the bed. "Now! Let's have the story.
How come you're reported dead, but still alive?"</p>

<p>Gaxton shrugged. "It was a mistake. After I called you and heard
the shots over the phone, I got panicky. I dropped the phone and
ran back to my cab. I told him to drive me out to Forest Hills.
There I hid out in a hotel room till six o'clock this morning.</p>

<p>"Then I couldn't rest any longer, and went out for a cup of
coffee. In the dining car, I heard over the radio about what had
happened in your room. It was only then that I realized you were
still alive. So I decided to go to see you at once. I got another
cab, and we started for the Queensboro Bridge. I was sure I had
lost Hito's Japs, but I kept watching all the time, and sure
enough, I saw a car parked just at the entrance to the bridge, with
two of the yellow killers in it.</p>

<p>"They saw me at the same time, and as we passed them they
started after us. I told my driver to hurry, and he raced over the
bridge. We overtook and passed another cab, just like ours, and the
Japs must have mistaken that one for mine. They blasted it."</p>

<p>Marty nodded. "They got the wrong man?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I heard the shot, and then the crash of the car. I looked
back and saw the flames. I paid off my driver and let him go. Then
I walked back to the burning cab and threw my wallet on the ground
nearby. That's how they figured me for dead."</p>

<p>"I see," said Marty. "And what about the car with the Japs in
it?"</p>

<p>"It must have escaped, back into Queens. I didn't see it."</p>

<p>"Are you sure those Japs didn't stick around and spot you
leaving the wallet?"</p>

<p>Andrew Gaxton turned white. "You&mdash;you mean&mdash;they could
have followed me&mdash;all the way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Anything is possible," Marty told him. "I suppose you never
looked behind you once, all the time you were waiting in that cab
for me to come out of the hotel?"</p>

<p>"Well, no," Gaxton admitted. He was nervously cracking the
knuckles of his right hand by squeezing them with his left. "It
never occurred to me that they might have picked up my
trail&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop cracking your knuckles!" Marty barked. "You'll have me
nuts in no time!" He waved angrily at the writer's hands. "What
about Esperanza Torres? Where does she fit in the picture?"</p>

<p>GAXTON shook his head. "I don't understand it at all. I left her
in Mexico City. I even kissed her goodby at the plane. She couldn't
possibly have been here ahead of me, which is what she must have
been, if she was at your hotel room while I was on the
wire&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is she a long and slinky dame," Marty asked, "with black hair
and black eyes, slender and beautiful as all hell?"</p>

<p>"That's she!" Gaxton exclaimed. "It's incredible that she should
have been here! She's my fianc&eacute;e. It's for her that I'm
doing all this&mdash;taking all these awful risks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doing all what?"</p>

<p>"Bringing the papers to New York."</p>

<p>He produced an envelope from his pocket. Out of the envelope he
took a folded batch of onionskin papers, which he opened.</p>

<p>"Here is conclusive proof that the Japanese are conducting a
Fifth Column campaign in Mexico and that they plan to establish
bases down there, from which to launch an air attack against the
United States!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Marty, taking the papers. "So this is Mr. Hito's
profession. He's a spy!"</p>

<p>"Of course!" exclaimed Gaxton. "He'd do anything under the sun
to get these papers back!"</p>

<p>Marty looked through them swiftly, and whistled. They were
photo-static copies of original documents, mostly written in
Spanish. One of them was a photograph of an order from the Mexican
Division of the Imperial Japanese Secret Service. The order
directed local commanders of Fifth Column units to report to Mexico
City to receive orders for "Q" Day, which would be the day upon
which an uprising was scheduled in the Province of Sonora.</p>

<p>Another was a copy of a letter from a Mexican official, asking
for additional funds. Attached to it was the reply from the Chief
of the Imperial Japanese Intelligence Service, instructing him that
money had been placed on deposit in a certain bank to his credit.
It was signed Colonel Matsuma Hito.</p>

<p>"Wow!" said Marty. "I should have shot that guy through the
gizzard!" He swung angrily on Gaxton. "Why didn't you take this
stuff straight to the State Department in Washington?"</p>

<p>"That's what I was going to do, but I got a radiogram while I
was on the plane. It was from Esperanza. Here." He pulled the
crumpled form from his coat pocket and thrust it at Marty.</p>

<p>The radiogram was in Spanish, but in between the lines, Gaxton
had scribbled the English translation:</p>

<p>JUAN IN OIL IF PAPERS ARRIVE WASHINGTON. FOR MY SAKE GO NEW YORK
AND MAKE DEAL WITH HITO WHO IS NOW THERE.</p>

<p>ESPERANZA.</p>

<p>"You see," explained Gaxton, "it means that the Japanese spies
down in Mexico City have kidnaped her brother, Juan, and threaten
to boil him in oil if I deliver these papers to the U. S. State
Department. Juan Torres and his sister, Esperanza, have been
collecting these documents for me.</p>

<p>"In fact, Juan Torres even posed as a traitor to Mexico in order
to get into the confidence of the Japanese Intelligence Service.
Now that they got him down there, it means that he'll die a slow
death&mdash;no matter if I give up the papers or not. But I decided
to see if I couldn't trick Hito into ordering him released. That's
why I decided to get you to protect me while I carried on the
negotiations."</p>

<p>Marty tapped the radiogram. "If Esperanza Torres sent you this
from Mexico City while you were on the plane, she certainly
couldn't have reached New York before you."</p>

<p>"That's right&mdash;"</p>

<p>Marty suddenly put up a hand to stop him. Out in the hall, the
bell was ringing. It was muffled, so that it would not awake anyone
asleep on the floor. But it was perfectly audible to anyone
listening for it. It rang three times, swiftly, then three times
again.</p>

<p>"The police!" Gaxton exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Worse!" said Marty, shaking his head. "Three times is the
signal for cops. Two three's is the signal that something else has
come up&mdash;also calling for a quick lam."</p>

<p>"The Japs!"</p>

<p>Marty nodded. "It looks like they trailed you, after all. Let's
be going, Gaxton!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap4" name="chap4">CHAPTER 4</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">HE HUSTLED Gaxton out into the hall and over to
the window. Behind them they could hear the old-fashioned elevator
machinery creaking as the cage rose slowly.</p>

<p>"They're coming up!" Gaxton groaned. "Lord, we'll never escape
them. They're devils&mdash;"</p>

<p>Marty wasn't listening. He was working like a Trojan at the
window, trying to pry it up. It hadn't been opened in so long a
time that it stuck stubbornly.</p>

<p>"Didn't I pay that Oliver fifty dollars for silence?" Gaxton
demanded. "How come he's bringing those Japs up here? How come he
talked? How come he told them what room we were in?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Hito's Japs have nasty ways of persuading people to talk,"
Marty said drily. "I don't blame Oliver at all. You wouldn't expect
him to let his eyes be put out for a mere fifty bucks, do you?"</p>

<p>The window still refused to yield, and the creaking of the
machinery became louder as the cage neared their floor.
Desperately, Marty reversed his revolver, wrapped his hat around
the butt and smashed out the window pane.</p>

<p>It tinkled against the fire escape outside, some of the broken
glass spattering against the wall of the adjoining building, which
was only a few feet across the alley. Marty trimmed off the jagged
ends of the remaining glass, and pushed Gaxton out on the fire
escape. He followed him closely.</p>

<p>Gaxton wanted to go down, but Marty pulled him the other
way.</p>

<p>"Up!" he ordered.</p>

<p>"But we'll be trapped on the roof&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Up!" Marty repeated, glaring at him.</p>

<p>Gaxton was too scared to put up much opposition. He started
climbing.</p>

<p>Marty remained at the fire escape, peering in through the broken
window. He heard the elevator cage come to a stop, and saw the
shaft door slide open. There were half a dozen wiry little Japanese
men in there, and it was one of them who was operating the
elevator. They started to surge out into the corridor, naked guns
ominous in their hands.</p>

<p>Marty Quade's eyes were bleak and hard. He raised his automatic
and pulled the trigger five times fast, sending a flailing barrage
of death into the huddled group of men. Cries of pain and surprise
rose among them, forming a sort of high-pitched threnody to the
thundering chorus of Marty's automatic obbligato.</p>

<p>The smashing slugs from Marty's gun hurled those men back into
the cage, threw them into a confused mass of dead and wounded. Some
one fired over the prostrate bodies of his fellows. The bullet
whispered in Marty's ear, then clanged an anvil chorus against the
iron railing of the fire escape behind him.</p>

<p>Grimly, Marty fired twice more, emptying his automatic. Turning
quickly, he dashed up the fire escape ladder after Gaxton.</p>

<p>The writer was waiting on the roof, trembling, in a cold sweat
of fear.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was wondering what I'd do if you got
killed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I get killed," Marty told him, "you might just as well jump
off the roof! Now come on!"</p>

<p>He led the other at a run across the top of the building to the
other side. Here, the roof connected with the roof of the adjoining
building.</p>

<p>"This is the way all of Oliver's tenants make their getaway when
the bell rings," he explained.</p>

<p>They crossed on to the next roof, and Marty pointed to a faint
red line, drawn in chalk, with arrows spotted on it every ten
feet.</p>

<p>"We just follow the red line," he told Gaxton. "Isn't it worth
fifty bucks?"</p>

<p>The red line ended in front of a skylight, the door of which was
swinging open. Gaxton eagerly lunged for it, but Marty pulled him
away. "That's only for the people who follow us. We go around."</p>

<p>CIRCLING the skylight, Marty came to a stop in front of a
dumbwaiter shaft. He opened the door, and there was the dumbwaiter,
empty and waiting to receive them.</p>

<p>Some alterations had been made in it, so that it was twice as
long as the usual dumbwaiter, with a sturdy, two-inch-thick shelf
in the middle. Each compartment was large enough to accommodate a
full-grown man, doubled over.</p>

<p>Marty stuffed Gaxton into the lower half and then climbed into
the upper half, himself. He reached out and pulled the door shut.
The daylight was immediately blotted out, leaving them in darkness.
Marty felt around and, finding the rope, hauled on it cautiously.
They began to descend, without sound.</p>

<p>Marty chuckled in the dark. "This is a remodeled tenement
house," he explained. "Now it's a furnished-room house, and they
don't use dumbwaiters any more. In fact, they've probably forgotten
that there ever was a dumbwaiter in the building. Oliver owns it.
While we're going down here to the cellar, those Japs&mdash;if any
of them are still alive&mdash;will be trooping down through the
skylight on the false trail."</p>

<p>"Look here, Quade," Gaxton said suddenly. "I begin to think
you're going to get me out of this. A little while ago, I had lost
hope. Now I'm beginning to breathe more freely."</p>

<p>"Don't get too optimistic," Marty warned, hauling on the rope.
"This Mr. Hito is a very clever man. He may pop up where you least
expect him."</p>

<p>They finally reached the bottom of the shaft, and Marty pushed
the shaft door open. They rolled out of their cramped position,
onto the basement floor. The dumbwaiter shaft was located in a
corner of the cellar, and the coal bin had been built up in front
of it, to screen it from observation.</p>

<p>They had to step gingerly over the coal, which slid and danced
under their feet. Finally, however they managed to scramble out,
alongside the furnace.</p>

<p>"Whew!" said Gaxton. "It's hot down here!"</p>

<p>Marty led the way toward the back door. "Go easy here," he
warned. "This takes us out into the same back yard as the hotel. If
Hito has posted any men out there, we'll have a fight on our
hands."</p>

<p>As he talked he slipped a fresh clip into his automatic.</p>

<p>"Listen, Quade," said Gaxton. "I haven't talked about money with
you. So far, you've earned more than I can ever pay you. If you get
me out of this alive, just name your fee."</p>

<p>"Yeah!" Marty grunted. "I've had experience with guys who were
willing to give me their shirt while the heat was on. But after I
got them in the clear, they didn't remember how grateful they'd
said they would be. Me, I like to get paid in advance."</p>

<p>"I've got plenty of money!" Gaxton rushed on, pulling out his
roll of bills. "Just say how much!"</p>

<p>Marty looked at the roll, estimating its value. "So far," he
said "I've given you about five thousand dollars' worth of service.
If we come out of this alive, I'll probably earn another five
thousand. I'll settle with you now for two grand."</p>

<p>"Make it three thousand!" Gaxton gurgled, and started peeling
hundreds off the back of the roll. He thrust the money into Marty's
hand.</p>

<p>Marty didn't count it, but slipped it casually into his pocket.
He grinned in the semi-darkness of the basement. "Always strike
while the iron is hot!" he said. "That's a damn good motto."</p>

<p>He led the way out of the cellar. At the back door he paused for
a moment, peering into the back yard. It was a cloudy, sunless day,
but there was enough light to perceive that the back yard was
empty. Marty nodded, and stepped out, but did not relax his
vigilance. Behind him, Gaxton crowded closely.</p>

<p>Marty nodded to the left. "There's an alley around the side of
this building. We go halfway up the alley and then step in through
the cellar door of the next house. That's the corner. We go out the
front way, and we'll be on Eighth Avenue. We can mix with the crowd
and grab a cab. Let's go."</p>

<p>They swung into the alley, and as soon as they had done so,
Marty knew they had walked into a trap. At the far end of the alley
there were two Japs with sub-machine guns. At the same time, Gaxton
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"They're after us, Quade! Behind us!"</p>

<p>Gaxton's last words were drowned out by the thunderous roar of
Marty's automatic. He hadn't waited for those machine gunners to
open up, but had started shooting the moment he spotted them.</p>

<p>This time he conserved his ammunition, because he knew the fight
wouldn't be over with the killing of those two. There were others
behind them. He fired only twice, and the two Jap machine gunners
went spinning backward, the weapons flying out of their hands.</p>

<p>They had been so supremely confident of the efficacy of their
quick-firers ever Marty's pistol, that they had waited just that
extra moment, to relish the taste of their triumph. And it was that
extra moment which meant the difference between life and death to
them. Marty hadn't waited to think. He had just started
shooting.</p>

<p>He didn't wait now to see where those two Japs fell. He whirled
around to see what was behind. At the same time he thrust Gaxton in
back of him.</p>

<p>IN the rear of the alley were several wiry, yellow men, guns in
their hands. The trap had been well-planned. Hito must have
surveyed the ground, like a good general, and decided just where
the enemy could retreat to if he should escape the killers who had
gone upstairs. Then he had stationed men down here, to insure the
success of his campaign.</p>

<p>The Japanese started shooting, and Marty, disdaining to kneel or
crouch, faced them, spraddle-legged, and traded shots with them.
Japanese, endowed with poor eyesight, are notoriously bad
shots.</p>

<p>Their bullets sang all around Marty and Gaxton, caroming off the
brick walls on either side, and ploughing into the ground. Marty
shot carefully, picking them off one by one.</p>

<p>He yelled over his shoulder to Gaxton: "Get going! Find that
side door and amscray!"</p>

<p>"But you'll be killed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get going, I say! I took your money, didn't I?"</p>

<p>There was no more opposition from Gaxton. Marty devoted his
attention solely to the fight. The thundering guns drowned out any
possible sound Gaxton might have made in retreating, so Marty
couldn't tell whether he had obeyed or not.</p>

<p>He was down to his last cartridge. He had knocked over a couple
or so of the yellow men, but more came crowding into the alley.
They formed a solid line across the width of the alley, and began
to charge. They came in at a run, their guns blazing in front of
them.</p>

<p>Marty fired his last shot. This was the end. Well, it was all in
the game. By his peculiar code of ethics, he deemed it his duty,
once he had taken a client's money, to serve that client, even at
the cost of his life. He had made plenty of money in his career,
and he had lived a fast, full life.</p>

<p>But he had always known that the end would come like this one
day, without notice and without preparation, and without benefit of
clergy. Well, he was ready for it.</p>

<p>He smiled grimly, and went into a crouch, running to meet that
charging line of death.</p>

<h2><a id="chap5" name="chap5">CHAPTER 5</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">FROM behind him came a frantic, desperate shout in
a voice so distorted that he had difficulty in recognizing it as
Gaxton's: "Down, Quade! Get down! Down!"</p>

<p>At the first sound of that voice, Marty caught the play. A great
feeling of elation warmed his blood at the thought that Gaxton was
coming through. He threw himself forward, flat on his face. He slid
along the concrete walk for a couple of feet, toward the charging
Japs.</p>

<p>And then, from behind him, there came the brittle staccato
chattering of a sub-machine gun. Bullets whined above Marty's head.
In front of him, the Japanese gunmen began to go down as if a high
wind were carrying them backward irresistibly.</p>

<p>The charge broke up. Those in front fell, writhing, to the
ground. Those behind turned to run, but were mowed down before they
could take more than a few steps. The withering hail of lead from
the sub-machine gun did not cease until the alley was entirely
cleared of the enemy.</p>

<p>Marty jumped to his feet and turned to where Gaxton knelt on one
knee, with one of the discarded submachine guns at his shoulder.
Gaxton grinned broadly and threw the gun away. Then he came running
toward Marty.</p>

<p>Marty dashed past him, knelt beside that sub-machine gun, and
vigorously wiped fingerprints from the stock. Then, jumping to his
feet, he seized Gaxton by the shoulder and propelled him toward the
side door of the adjoining building. He pulled it open, yanked
Gaxton in after him, and closed it.</p>

<p>Already, people were running toward the alley. Peering in from
the street, Marty glimpsed their faces as he closed the door. Also,
he heard a shrill police whistle, repeated over and over again.</p>

<p>He made sure the door was closed, then found the latch and
turned it. Gaxton was breathing noisily behind him.</p>

<p>Marty took him by the arm and led him down a flight of stairs,
then across the basement, and up another flight of stairs. They
found themselves in the rear of a motion picture theatre.</p>

<p>It was dark in here, and the house was empty and deserted. The
show wouldn't begin for hours. Marty hurried up the aisle to the
front, found the small office which opened into the lobby. He
turned the catch and pushed it open, and they stepped through.</p>

<p>In the street, a crowd had gathered at the mouth of the alley,
watching the uniformed policeman who had bravely gone in there with
his whistle blowing. But none of the crowd dared follow him.</p>

<p>Just as Marty and Gaxton got out on the sidewalk, a police radio
car pulled up with squealing brakes, and two more officers got out
on the run. The crowd was growing thicker by the second.</p>

<p>Marty nodded, and piloted Gaxton down Eighth Avenue to the next
corner. They found a cab, and Marty said: "Grand Central
Station."</p>

<p>As the taxi wound through traffic, Marty put a new clip in his
automatic. Then he looked at Gaxton.</p>

<p>"Andy," he said, "you're okay by me. That was a nice piece of
work you did back there. I never figured you for so much guts."</p>

<p>Gaxton blushed. "Aw, hell, Marty, I had to keep you alive. With
you dead, I'd have been in the soup for fair. I wouldn't have known
which way to turn."</p>

<p>"All the same," Marty said, "you saved my life, when you could
have got away clean. I won't forget it."</p>

<p>They got out at Grand Central Station. Inside, Marty led Gaxton
over to the operator-serviced phone booths in the Concourse, and
shoved him into one of them.</p>

<p>"You call the State Department in Washington," he ordered, "and
tell them what you have. Make an appointment to meet some one there
in a couple of hours. Then we'll go across the street to the
Airlines Terminal and book passage in a Washington plane. We'll be
out of New York before Hito's killers pick up our trail again."</p>

<p>"I can't do it, Marty!" Gaxton protested. "If I turn these
papers over to the State Department, Hito's men in Mexico City will
boil Juan Torres in oil. How could I face Esperanza, after having
done that to her brother?"</p>

<p>MARTY nodded. He was beginning to understand the peculiar and
steadfast loyalty of this Andrew Gaxton, whom he had
underestimated. Just as Gaxton had been willing to pick up a
machine gun and fight for Marty, he was willing to go to any
lengths to save the brother of his sweetheart.</p>

<p>"All right, then," Marty said suddenly. "You get in there and
put in a long distance call for Esperanza Torres."</p>

<p>"In Mexico City?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"But you said you saw her here in New York this morning."</p>

<p>"I say I saw her in New York, and you say you left her in Mexico
City. So suppose you call up and find out. Maybe she's crossing
you. Otherwise, why would she want to shoot me in the seat of the
pants?"</p>

<p>Shrugging, Gaxton went over to the operator and put through a
person-to-person call for Esperanza Torres, in Mexico City.</p>

<p>"That will be seven dollars for three minutes, sir," the girl at
the switchboard said. "Plus twenty cents tax. "</p>

<p>"Better give her twenty dollars," Marty advised. "You'll
probably talk more than three minutes. You can get your change when
you finish."</p>

<p>Gaxton gave her the money, and returned to the booth. It was
only seventy-two seconds by Marty's watch when the connection with
Mexico City was completed. Gaxton had to close the door so he could
hear above the noises of the station.</p>

<p>Marty, watching him, saw him talking urgently and desperately,
then he saw him become pale and taut. Gaxton took out paper and
pencil and scribbled something down. After talking for another
minute, he hung up.</p>

<p>He came out of the booth, shaken and trembling. He thrust the
paper into Marty's hand. On it was written an address:</p>

<p>Bianca Torres, Hotel Hutton</p>

<p>"What's this?" Marty asked.</p>

<p>Gaxton seemed to be in a daze. "It&mdash;it's Esperanza's
sister, Bianca. It was she who shot at you this morning. I'd
forgotten that Esperanza ever had a sister. Bianca went to Spain to
serve as a nurse in the Loyalist Army, and she was captured by
Franco.</p>

<p>"She escaped, and wandered all over France for a year, then got
passage on a refugee boat for New York. She's been here a couple of
months. After I left in the plane, Esperanza cabled her that I was
coming to New York, and that you would work with me. She also
warned her that Hito was in New York. She said Bianca would
co-operate with you and me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She picked a fine way to co-operate!" Marty said bitterly.</p>

<p>"But that isn't all!" Gaxton exclaimed. He stopped, and gulped,
then rushed on. "Juan Torres was killed last night! They fished his
body out of the bay. He had been dipped in a vat of hot oil, then
tossed into the ocean. They&mdash;they didn't wait to see if I'd
turn the papers over to the State Department!"</p>

<p>"The devils!" Marty said hotly. He gripped Gaxton's arm. "Now
you are free to hand those papers over."</p>

<p>"No, no!" the writer groaned. "Esperanza got a call from Hito's
representative down in Mexico City. The fellow said that Hito knew
the whereabouts of Bianca here in New York, and would give her the
hot-oil treatment unless I return the papers to him. Hito figures
that we might let Juan die, but that we'd never let a thing like
that happen to a beautiful girl like Bianca!"</p>

<p>"Oh, hell!" said Marty. "Let's go and find this Bianca."</p>

<p>He took Gaxton's arm and started to turn around, and some one
said: "Why, you're certainly going somewhere, Mr. Quade. But not to
find any dames. You're coming down to a nice clean cell in police
headquarters!"</p>

<p>Marty stopped short, facing Detective Sergeant Sloane, of the
homicide detail.</p>

<p>"Fancy meeting you here!" Sloane said, taking out his handcuffs.
"We've been combing the city for you, but we never figured you'd be
sap enough to come to Grand Central Station."</p>

<p>"That's what I figured you'd figure," Marty said sourly. "That's
why we came here."</p>

<p>"Only by accident did I see you," Sloane apologized. "I'm just
going off duty, and I'm on my way home to Larchmont. But I'll give
up my time off&mdash;for the privilege of taking you in!"</p>

<p>"Don't bother," Marty said, and swung for Sloane's jaw.</p>

<p>HIS short punch had all the power of his shoulder muscles behind
it. Sloane said, "Ar-gh!" and buckled at the knees.</p>

<p>Marty caught him and let him down easily, taking the handcuffs
out of his hands and slipping them into his own pocket as he did
so. A number of people turned to look. No one had actually seen the
punch, and they thought Sloane was just another drunk. A uniformed
station guard came running over, and Marty yelled to him.</p>

<p>"Officer! Officer! This man needs medical attention!"</p>

<p>The guard knelt hastily alongside Sloane, and Marty stood up. He
gave Gaxton the high-sign, and they faded away. They went out the
Vanderbilt Avenue exit, and Marty started walking hurriedly
north.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" Gaxton demanded.</p>

<p>"To check on Bianca Torres. Maybe we're not too late to stop
Hito from grabbing her!"</p>

<p>"With every cop on the police force looking for us," Gaxton
commented breathlessly, "we have a fine chance of blocking Hito! I
don't understand why he should have killed Juan, and switched to
Bianca."</p>

<p>"I do!" Marty barked, swinging briskly into a side-street, and
heading east. "Bianca is in New York, while Juan was in Mexico
City. Knowing you, Hito figures you'll make a try to save Bianca.
And he'll be waiting for you, Andy. Make no mistake about
that&mdash;if Bianca's still at the Hutton Hotel, then Hito and his
killers won't be far away. They're waiting for us!"</p>

<p>"You think it's a trap?"</p>

<p>"Nothing else but!"</p>

<p>"Then why're we going?"</p>

<p>"Because there's nothing else for us to do. We can't wander
around New York, waiting for some copper to pick us up. And we
can't smack them all in the jaw, either. Our only out is to find
Mr. Hito and have it out with him&mdash;win or lose, kill or
die!"</p>

<p>"And I haven't even got a gun!" Gaxton said ruefully.</p>

<p>Marty grinned, and took a police service thirty-eight out of his
coat pocket and handed it to him. "I did a little pickpocketing
when I was kneeling alongside Sloane," he explained.</p>

<p>Gaxton took the gun gingerly. "I never handled one of
these."</p>

<p>"You did all right with the submachine gun," Marty told him.
"Just do as well with that, and we'll come out all right. Be sure
the muzzle is turned toward the other guy when you pull the
trigger."</p>

<p>Gaxton grinned. "Marty, I've been writing about crime and crime
fighters for years. But today was the first time I ever held a gun
in my hand. I like it. I think I'll become a man of action instead
of just writing about them."</p>

<p>"Don't make plans for your future," Marty warned, "till you know
Mr. Hito is six feet under ground."</p>

<p>They stopped in front of a small but highly conservative looking
hotel, with a small brass plaque alongside the door. The plaque
read:</p>

<p>HOTEL HUTTON</p>

<p>Marty took a quick look around. "No Japs in sight," he said.
"But that doesn't mean they're not around. Keep your hand on the
butt of that gun."</p>

<p>They entered the Hotel Hutton, and want up to the desk.</p>

<p>"We're calling on Miss Bianca Torres," Marty said.</p>

<p>The clerk raised his eyebrows. "Name, please?"</p>

<p>"Tell her it's Mr. Black and Mr. White."</p>

<p>"H'm!" The clerk coughed his disapproval, but went to the house
phone. A moment later he returned, however, and said: "You may go
right up, gentlemen. It's Suite 1212."</p>

<p>Marty nodded and led the way to the elevator. The cage took them
up to the twelfth floor, and left them alone in the quiet, carpeted
hallway. The walls were adorned with wallpaper, and imbued the
place with an atmosphere of subdued respectability. But Gaxton
shivered a little.</p>

<p>"I feel as if we were walking on a keg of T.N.T.!" he
whispered.</p>

<p>Marty grinned, and stopped in front of Room 1212. He rapped
twice, but there was no answer. He took out his gun, and pushed at
the door. It was unlocked, and it came open, revealing a two-room
suite with a little foyer.</p>

<p>He could see into the living room, and it was evident that there
was no one there. At the right, a bathroom door was partly open,
while at the left the door to the bedroom swung wide. Part of a bed
was visible.</p>

<p>Upon it lay the motionless figure of a woman. A blanket covered
her, but it came down only to her knees, exposing her dress. It was
the same red dress Bianca Torres had worn that morning.</p>

<p>Marty cat-footed into the living room. He turned and whispered
to Gaxton: "You stay right here in the foyer, and keep your back to
the wall. Cover me."</p>

<p>Gaxton nodded, and gripped the police revolver tightly.</p>

<p>Marty crossed the living room, ignoring the open door of the
bathroom, and stepped into the bedroom.</p>

<p>Almost at once, a head arose behind the bed.</p>

<p>IT WAS the familiar head of Mr. Matsuma Hito. Only his eyes
showed, and one hand, which held a gun trained upon the temple of
Bianca Torres. At the same time, two other Japanese heads arose
from behind the two boudoir chairs in the room.</p>

<p>Guns appeared beside those heads, trained on Marty. At the same
time, Hito whipped the blanket off Bianca Torres, revealing that
her arms were tied cruelly behind her back.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Quade," Hito said pleasantly. "It was nice of
you to come&mdash;so that I can complete my unfinished job of this
morning."</p>

<p>"You fool!" Bianca exclaimed from the bed. "W'y you 'ave come?
W'y you no 'ave let Andrew geev those paper to thee State
Department, an' let me die!"</p>

<p>Marty glanced at the two Japs, barricaded behind the chairs on
either side of him. Then he looked over at the cynical countenance
of Mr. Matsuma Hito, behind the bed, and at Bianca's slim, bound
figure. He grinned at her.</p>

<p>"You're certainly worried about me now&mdash;for a dame that
tried to pump me full of lead this morning!"</p>

<p>"Eet was a meestake!" she exclaimed. "Thee cablegram from my
sister&mdash;she 'ave been meex up in thee translation. Esperanza
'ave say that you work weeth Andrew, but thee translation 'ave say
that you work weeth Hito. I 'ave theenk you are a traitor to your
friend, Gaxton, an' I 'ave go to keel you."</p>

<p>"I see," said Marty. "And now we're all going to be killed by
Mr. Hito."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said the Jap, still hiding behind the bed. "Mr.
Gaxton will be taken care of in the next room, by my men who were
hiding in the bathroom&mdash;"</p>

<p>From out in the living room there was a sudden flurry of shots.
Marty could distinguish the deep booming of the police positive,
throatily drowning out the spiteful bark of smaller calibre
pistols.</p>

<p>Marty jumped forward into the bedroom, and the two Japs fired
from behind their chairs. Marty paid no attention to them. He went
for Hito. He leaped high up, on to the bed, alongside Bianca.</p>

<p>Now he was above the Japanese spy-master. Hito, squealing,
raised his gun to shoot upward, but Marty slanted a shot downward
from his automatic, and it took Mr. Hito right in the top of the
head.</p>

<p>Marty bounced off the bed, amid a flying barrage of shots from
the two Japs. He landed flat on the floor, snapped a shot at the
right-hand chair, and saw that Jap's face disintegrate, then he
rolled over and fired at the other Jap.</p>

<p>That fellow didn't seem to care much for the fight any more. He
threw his gun away and raised his hands in the air. Marty's bullet
had nicked him across the top of the scalp, and he looked
groggy.</p>

<p>Marty grunted, sprang to his feet, and tapped the fellow on the
head with the barrel of his automatic. Then he sprang out into the
living room to see if Gaxton needed any help.</p>

<p>Two dead Japs were lying across the threshold of the bathroom,
and a third was peering around the door jamb to get a shot at
Gaxton, who had dropped to one knee. The Jap was hidden pretty well
from Gaxton, but he was in full view of Marty. Grimly, Marty let
him have one in the shoulder; and the fellow tumbled backward.</p>

<p>Gaxton sprang up and exclaimed: "Marty! We've won!"</p>

<p>Marty nodded soberly, and turned back into the bedroom. He went
over to the bed and untied Bianca's arms. She smiled up at him, her
lips full and warm.</p>

<p>"You weel forgeev me for that I 'ave shoot at you, no?"</p>

<p>"Baby," said Marty, "I'd forgive you anything!"</p>

<p>He helped her up and into the next room, just in time to greet a
rushing deputation of uniformed police and detectives who barged in
with drawn guns. It took him a little while to explain things, and
by that time Inspector Hanson arrived, and he had to explain
everything over again.</p>

<p>There were calls to the State Department, and the F.B.I., and to
Mexico City, and at the end of it all, Marty took Bianca's arm with
one hand and Gaxton's with the other and said:</p>

<p>"Let's go get some more breakfast. I never had a chance to
finish my first."</p>

<p>Inspector Hanson came over and took his arm in a grip of steel.
"There's only one place you are going, my fine-feathered friend.
That's back to the hotel restaurant and pay that check you tried to
stick me with!"</p>

<p>Marty grinned. "It's a pleasure, Hanson. I earned enough today
to pay your salary for six months. I can afford a breakfast."</p>

<p>Bianca Torres pushed Hanson away, and wrapped her arm around
Marty's. She snuggled close, and looked up at him with a warm
smile.</p>

<p>"He shall go weeth none of you. 'E 'ave promise' that 'e forgeev
me for that I 'ave shoot at heem. 'E mus' come weeth me. Eet shall
take heem a long time&mdash;thees forgeeving!"</p>

<p>She thrust them all aside, and led Marty out of the room.</p>

<p>Watching him angrily, Hanson growled: "You always were a lucky
skunk, Quade!"</p>

<p>Marty turned at the door, with Bianca on his arm, and bowed.</p>

<p>"Better luck next time, Inspector Hanson," he said,
grinning.</p>
