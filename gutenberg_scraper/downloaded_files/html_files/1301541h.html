  <h3>A FATHER BROWN STORY</h3>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Premier</i>, November 1914</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="blurb">In the October 1914 issue of the British magazine <i>The
  Premier</i>, Sir Max Pemberton published the first part of this story,
  inviting a number of writers, including Chesterton, to use their talents to
  solve the mystery of the murder described. Chesterton's solution followed in
  the form of a Father Brown story in the November issue.</p>
  <hr>

  <p class="first">IT was natural, of course, that we should think of calling
  in expert opinion on the tragedy; or, at least, something subtler than the
  passing policeman. But I could think of few people or none whom it would be
  useful to consult thus privately. I remembered an investigator who had taken
  some interest in Southby&rsquo;s original trouble; merely because I
  remembered the curious surname of Shrike; but report told me that he had
  since grown rich and retired, and was now yachting inaccessibly among the
  Pacific Islands.</p>

  <p>My old friend Brown, the Roman priest at Cobhole, who had often given me
  good advice in small problems, had wired that he feared he could not come
  down, even for an hour. He merely added&mdash;what, I confess, I thought
  inconsequent&mdash;that the key might be found in the sentence, that
  &ldquo;Mester was the cheeriest soul possible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Superintendent Matthews still carries weight with any considering person
  who has actually talked to him; but he is naturally in most cases officially
  reticent, and in some cases officially slow.</p>

  <p>Sir Borrow seemed stricken rigid by this final tragedy; a thing pardonable
  enough in a very old man who, whatever his faults, had never had anything but
  tragedy upon tragedy out of his own blood and name.</p>

  <p>Wellman can be trusted with anything up to the Crown jewels; but not with
  an idea. Harriet is far too good a woman to be a good detective. So I was
  left with my unsatisfied appetite for expert advice. I think the others
  shared it to some extent; I think we wished a man different from all of us
  would walk into the room, a man of the world outside us, a man of wider
  experience, a man of experience so wide&mdash;if it were possible&mdash;that
  he should know even one case that was like our own. Certainly none of us had
  the wildest suspicion of who the man would be.</p>

  <p>I have explained that when poor Evelyn&rsquo;s body was found it was clad
  in a dressing-gown, as if she had been suddenly summoned from her room, and
  the door of the Priest&rsquo;s Room stood open. Acting on I know not what
  impulse, I had closed it to; and, so far as I know, it was not opened again
  till it was opened from within. I confess that for me that opening was
  terrible.</p>

  <p>Sir Borrow, Wellman, and I were alone in the chamber of slaughter. At
  least we were alone till a total stranger strolled into the room, without
  even pulling the peaked cap off his head. He was a sturdy man, stained with
  travel, especially as regards his leggings, which were loaded with clay and
  slime of innumerable ditches. But he was entirely unconcerned, which is more
  than I was. For, despite his extra dirt and his extra impudence, I recognised
  him as the fugitive convict, Mester, whose letter I had so foolishly passed
  on to his fellow convict. He entered the room with his hands in his pockets,
  and whistling. Then the whistling ceased, and he said:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You seem to have shut the door again. I suppose you know it&rsquo;s
  not easy to open again on this side.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Through the broken window which gave upon the garden I could see
  Superintendent Matthews standing passively among the shrubs, with his broad
  back to the house. I walked to the window, and also whistled, but in a far
  more practical spirit. And yet, I know not why I should call it practical,
  for the superintendent, who must have heard me, did not turn his head, nor so
  much as shift a shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t worry poor old Matthews,&rdquo; said the man in
  the peaked cap in a friendly tone, &ldquo;he is one of the best men in the
  service, and he must be awfully tired. I expect I can answer nearly all the
  questions that he could.&rdquo; And he relighted a cigarette.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Mester,&rdquo; I replied with some heat, &ldquo;I was sending
  for the superintendent to arrest you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; he answered, throwing his wax match out of the
  window. &ldquo;Well, he won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was gazing at me with a grave stolidity. And yet I fancy that the
  gravity of his full face had less effect on me than the large, indifferent
  back of the policeman.</p>

  <p>The man called Mester resumed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean that my position here may not be quite what you suppose.
  It&rsquo;s true enough I assisted the young fellow to escape; but I
  don&rsquo;t imagine you know why I did it. It is an old rule in our
  profession&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Before he could finish I had uttered a cry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; I cried out. &ldquo;Who is that behind the
  door?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I could see, by the very movement of Mester&rsquo;s mouth, that he was
  just about to answer, &ldquo;What door?&rdquo; But before the lips could move
  he also was answered. And from behind the sealed door of the secret chamber
  came the noise of something that was alive, if it were not human, or was
  moving, if it were not alive.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is in the Priest&rsquo;s Room?&rdquo; I cried, and looked
  round for something with which to break down the door. I had half lifted the
  piece of jagged iron bar for the purpose. And then the horrid part it had
  played in that night overwhelmed me, and I fell against the door and beat on
  it with feeble hands, only repeating, &ldquo;What is in the Priest&rsquo;s
  Room?&rdquo; It was the awful fact that a voice, obscure but human, answered
  from behind the closed door, &ldquo;The Priest!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The heavy door was opened very slowly, apparently pushed by a hand no
  stronger than my own. The same voice which had said &ldquo;The Priest,&rdquo;
  said in rather simpler tones, &ldquo;Whom else did you expect?&rdquo; The
  door swung out slowly to the full compass of its hinges, and revealed the
  black silhouette of a stumpy, apologetic person, with a big hat and a bad
  umbrella. He was in every way a very unromantic and inappropriate person to
  be in the Priest&rsquo;s Room, save in the accidental detail of being a
  priest.</p>

  <p>He walked straight up to me before I could cry: &ldquo;You have come,
  after all!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook my hand, and, before he dropped it, looked at me with a steady
  and singular expression, sad, and yet rather serious than sad. I can only say
  it was the face we wear at the funeral of one dear as a friend, not that we
  wear by the deathbed of any directly dear to us.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can at least congratulate you,&rdquo; said Father Brown.</p>

  <p>I think I put my hand wildly through my hair. I am sure I answered:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what is there in this nightmare on which I can be
  congratulated?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He answered me with the same solid face:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the innocence of the woman who will be your wife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; I cried indignantly, &ldquo;has attempted to connect
  her with the matter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He nodded gravely, as if in assent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That was the danger, doubtless,&rdquo; he said with a slight sigh,
  &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s all right now, thank God. Isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; And
  as if to give the last touch to the topsyturvydom, he turned to ask his
  question of the man in the peaked cap.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s safe enough!&rdquo; said the man called Mester.</p>

  <p>I cannot deny that there was suddenly lifted off my heart a load of doubt,
  which I had never known was there. But I was bound to pursue the problem.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean, Father Brown,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;that you know who
  was the guilty person?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In a sense, yes,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But you must remember
  that in a murder case the guiltiest person is not always the
  murderer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, the guiltiest person, then,&rdquo; I cried impatiently.
  &ldquo;How are we to bring the guiltiest person to punishment?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The guiltiest person is punished,&rdquo; said Father Brown.</p>

  <p>There was a long silence in the twilight turret, and my mind laboured with
  doubts that were too large for it. At last Mester said gruffly, but not
  without a kind of good-nature:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think you two reverend gentlemen had better go and have a talk
  somewhere. About Hades, say, or hassocks, or whatever you do talk about. I
  shall have to look into this by myself. My name is Stephen Shrike; you may
  have heard of me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Even before such fancies had been swallowed up in my sudden fear at the
  movements in the secret room, I had faced the startling possibility that this
  escaped convict was really a detective. But I had not dreamed of his being so
  famous a one. The man who had been concerned for Southby, and since gained
  colossal prestige, had some claim in the case; and I followed Brown, who had
  already strolled down towards the entrance of the garden.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The distinction between Hades and hassocks&mdash;&rdquo; began
  Father Brown.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play the fool!&rdquo; I said, roughly enough.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was not without some philosophical value,&rdquo; continued the
  little priest, with unruffled good temper. &ldquo;Human troubles are mostly
  of two kinds. There is an accidental kind, that you can&rsquo;t see because
  they are so close you fall over as you do over a hassock. And there is the
  other kind of evil, the real kind. And that a man will go to seek however far
  off it is&mdash;down, down, into the lost abyss.&rdquo; And he unconsciously
  pointed his stumpy finger downward towards the grass, which was sprinkled
  with daisies.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was good of you to come, after all,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but I
  wish I could make more sense of the things you say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he replied patiently, &ldquo;have you made sense of
  the one thing I did say before I came down?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, you made some wild statement,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that
  the key of the story was in Mester&rsquo;s being cheerful, but&mdash;why,
  bless my soul, and so it is the key, in a way!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only the key, so far,&rdquo; said my companion, &ldquo;but my first
  guess seems to have been right. It is not very common to find such sparkling
  gaiety in people undergoing penal servitude, especially when ruined on a
  false charge. And it seemed to me that Mester&rsquo;s optimism was a little
  overdone. I also suspected that his aviation, and all the rest of it, true or
  false, were simply meant to make Southby think the escape feasible. But if
  Mester was such a demon for escaping, why didn&rsquo;t he escape by himself?
  Why was he so anxious to lug along a young gentleman who does not seem to
  have been much use to him? As I was wondering, my eye fell on another
  sentence in your manuscript.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

  <p>He took out a scrap of paper on which there were some scribbles in pencil,
  and read out:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They then crossed an enclosure in which other prisoners were
  at work.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After another pause, he resumed:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That, of course, was plain enough. What kind of convict prison is
  it where prisoners work without any warders overseeing or walking about? What
  sort of warders are they to allow two convicts to climb two walls and go off
  as if for a picnic? All that is plain. And the conclusion is plainer from
  many other sentences. &lsquo;It seemed such an impossible thing that he could
  evade the hue and cry that must attend this flight.&rsquo; It would have been
  impossible if there had been any hue and cry. &lsquo;Evelyn and Harriet heard
  me eagerly, and the former, I began to suspect, was already in possession of
  the story.&rsquo; How could she be in possession of it so early as that,
  unless the police cars and telephones helped to send word from Southby? Could
  the convicts catch a camel or an ostrich? And look at the motor-boat. Do
  motor-boats grow on trees? No, that&rsquo;s all simple. Not only was the
  companion in the escape a police detective, but the whole scheme of the
  escape was a police scheme, engineered by the highest authorities of the
  prison.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; I asked, staring. &ldquo;And what has Southby to do
  with it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Southby had nothing to do with it,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I
  believe he is now hiding in some ditch or wood in the sincere belief that he
  is a hunted fugitive. But they won&rsquo;t trouble him any more. He has done
  their work for them. He is innocent. It was essential that he should be
  innocent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t understand all this!&rdquo; I cried
  impatiently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand half of this,&rdquo; said Father Brown.
  &ldquo;There are all sorts of difficulties I will ask you about later. You
  knew the family. I only say that the sentence about cheerfulness did turn out
  to be a key-sentence, after all. Now, I want you to concentrate your
  attention on another key-sentence. &lsquo;We decided that Harriet should go
  to Bath without loss of time, in case she should be of any assistance
  there.&rsquo; Note that this comes soon after your expression of surprise
  that someone should have communicated with Evelyn so early. Well, I suppose
  we none of us think the governor of the prison wired to her: &lsquo;Have
  connived at escape of your brother, Convict 99.&rsquo; The message must have
  come in Southby&rsquo;s name, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I ruminated, looking at the roll of the downs as it rose and repeated
  itself through every gap in the garden trees; then I said,
  &ldquo;Kennington?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>My old friend looked at me for a moment with a look which, this time, I
  could not analyse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Captain Kennigton&rsquo;s part in the business is unique in my
  experience,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I think we had better return to him
  later. It is enough that, by your own account, Southby did not give him his
  confidence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I looked again at the glimpses of the downs, and they looked grander but
  greyer, as my companion went on, like one who can only put things in their
  proper order.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean the argument here is close, but clear. If she had any secret
  message from her brother about his escaping, why shouldn&rsquo;t she have a
  message about where he was escaping to? Why should she send off her sister to
  Bath, when she might just as well have been told that her brother
  wasn&rsquo;t going there? Surely a young gentleman might more safely say, in
  a private letter, that he was going to Bath than that he was escaping from
  prison? Somebody or something must have influenced Southby to leave his
  destination uncertain. And who could influence Southby except the companion
  of his flight?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who was acting for the police, on your theory.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. On his confession.&rdquo; After a sort of snorting silence,
  Brown said, with an emphasis I have never seen in him, throwing himself on a
  garden-seat: &ldquo;I tell you this whole business of the two cities of
  refuge&mdash;this whole business of Harriet Donnington going to
  Bath&mdash;was a suggestion that came through Southby, but from Mester, or
  Shrike, or whatever his name is, and is the key of the police plot.&rdquo; He
  had settled himself on a seat facing me, clasping his hands over the huge
  head of his umbrella in a more truculent manner than was typical of him. But
  an evening moon was brightening above the little plantation under which he
  sat, and when I saw his plain face again, I saw it was as mild as the
  moon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;should they want such a
  plot?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To separate the sisters,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is the
  key.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I answered quickly: &ldquo;The sisters could not really be
  separated.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, they could,&rdquo; said Father Brown, &ldquo;quite simply, and
  that is why&mdash;&rdquo; Here his simplicity failed, and he hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is why?&rdquo; I insisted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is why I can congratulate you,&rdquo; he said at last.</p>

  <p>Silence sank again for a little, and I could not define the irritation
  with which I answered:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose you know all about it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no really!&rdquo; he said, leaning forward as if to deny an
  accusation of injustice. &ldquo;I am puzzled about the whole business. Why
  didn&rsquo;t the warders find it sooner? Why did they find it at all? Was it
  slipped in the lining? Or is the handwriting so bad as that? I know about the
  thing being gentlemanly; but surely they took his clothes! How could the
  message come? It must be the lining.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His face was turned up as honestly as a flat and floating fish, and I
  could say with corresponding mildness:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I really do not know what you are talking about, you and your
  linings. But if you mean how could Southby get his message safely to his
  sister without the risks of interception, I should say there were no people
  more likely to do it successfully. The boy and girl were always great friends
  from childhood, and had, to my knowledge, one of those secret languages that
  children often have, which may easily have been turned afterwards into some
  sort of cypher. And now I come to think of it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The heavy-knobbed umbrella slipped from the seat and slammed on the
  gravel, and the priest stood upright.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What an idiot I am!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why, anybody might have
  thought of a cypher! That was a score for you, my friend. I suppose you know
  all about it now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I am certain he did not realise that he was repeating in sincerity what I
  had said in irony.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered, with real seriousness; &ldquo;I do not know
  all about it, but I think it quite possible that you do. Tell me the
  story.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is not a good story,&rdquo; he said, in a rather stony
  way&mdash;&ldquo;at least, the good thing about it is that it is over. But
  first let me say what I least like saying&mdash;that you knew well. I have
  thought a good deal about a certain kind of intellectual English lady,
  especially when she is at once aristocratic and provincial. I think she is
  judged much too easily. Or, perhaps, I should say, judged much too hardly;
  since she is supposed to be incapable of mortal passions and temptations. Let
  her decline champagne at dinner, let her be beautiful and know what is meant
  by dignity in dress, let her read a great many books and talk about high
  ideals, and you all assume that she alone of her kind cannot covet or lie;
  that her ideas are always simple, and her ideals always fulfilled. But,
  really and truly, my friend, by your account of it, the character was more
  mixed than that. Evelyn feigned an indisposition very cleverly. Assuming her
  to be blameless, I cannot see why she needed to feign anything. But, anyhow,
  it is scarcely one of the powers given to the saints. You &lsquo;began to
  suspect&rsquo; that Evelyn already knew about the escape. Why didn&rsquo;t
  she tell you she already knew about it? You were astonished that
  Superintendent Matthews had called, and she had been silent about it; but you
  supposed it was difficult to send. Why should it be difficult to send? You
  seem to have been sent for whenever you were really wanted. No; I will try to
  speak of this woman as of one for whose soul I will pray, and whose true
  defence I shall never hear. But while there are living people whose honour is
  in cruel danger undeservedly, I simply refuse to start with the assumption
  that Evelyn Donnington could do no wrong.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The noble hills of Sussex looked as dreary as Yorkshire moors as he went
  on heavily, prodding the earth with his umbrella.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The first facts in her defence, if she needed one, are that her
  father is a miser, that he has a violent temper combined with a rather
  Puritanic sort of family pride; and, above all, that she was afraid of him.
  Now, suppose she really wanted money, perhaps for a good purpose; or, again,
  perhaps not. She and her brother, you told me, had always had secret
  languages and plots; they are common among cowed and terrorised children. I
  firmly believe myself that she went a step further in some desperate strait,
  and that she was really and criminally responsible for the false document
  with which her brother seemed to be seeking financial help. We know there is
  often a family resemblance in handwritings almost amounting to facsimile. I
  cannot see, therefore, why there should not be a similar family resemblance
  in the flaws by which experts detect a forgery. Anyhow, the brother had a bad
  record, which goes for a great deal more than it ought with the police; and
  he was sent to gaol. I think you will agree that he has a very good record
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; I said, curiously thrilled by the very restraint
  of his expression, &ldquo;that Southby suffered all that time rather than
  speak?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rejoice not against me, Satan, mine enemy,&rdquo; said Father
  Brown, &ldquo;for when I fall I shall arise. This part of the story really is
  good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After a silence he continued:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When he was arrested, I am now almost certain, he had on him some
  letter or message from his sister. I hope and believe that it was some sort
  of penitent message. But whatever it was, it must have contained two
  things&mdash;some admission or allusion that made her own guilt clear, and
  some urgent request that her brother should come straight to her as soon as
  he was free to do so. Most important of all, it was not signed with a
  Christian name, but only &lsquo;Your unhappy sister.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, my good man,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;you talk as if you had
  seen the letter!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see it in its consequences,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The
  friendship with Mester, the quarrel with Kennington, the sister in Bath and
  the brother in the Priest&rsquo;s Room, came from that letter, and no other
  letter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The letter, however, was in cypher; and one very hard to follow,
  having been invented by children. Does that strike you as paradoxical?
  Don&rsquo;t you know that the hardest signs to read are arbitrary ones? And
  if two children agree that &lsquo;grunk&rsquo; means bedtime and
  &lsquo;splosh&rsquo; means Uncle William, it would take an expert much longer
  to learn this than to expose any system of substituted letters or numbers.
  Consequently, though the police found the paper, of course, it took them
  half-way through Southby&rsquo;s term to make head or tail of it. Then they
  knew that one of Southby&rsquo;s sisters were guilty, that he was innocent;
  and by this time they had the sense to see that he would never betray the
  truth. The rest, as I said, was simple and logical. The only other thing they
  could do was to take advantage of Southby being asked to go straight to his
  guilty correspondent. He was given every facility for escaping and
  communicating as quickly as possible, so long as the police could secure the
  separation of the sisters, by Mester getting the other one to Bath. Given
  that, the sister Southby went for must be the guilty one. And when, through
  those awful nights, the police gathered round you thick as wolves and still
  as ghosts&mdash;it was not for Southby they were waiting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why did they wait for anyone?&rdquo; I asked suddenly, after a
  silence. &ldquo;If they were sure, why didn&rsquo;t they arrest?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He nodded and sighed:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right. Perhaps it&rsquo;s best to take the
  Kennington case here. Well, of course, he knew all about it from the inside.
  You yourself noticed that he had privileges in that prison. It will grieve
  you, as a law-abiding person, to learn that he used his power to intercept
  what had been decided. A good deal can be done by missing appointments. A
  good deal more can be done by not missing people&mdash;vulgarly known as
  hitting them. He used every chance, right or wrong, to delay the arrest. One
  of the thousand small, desperate delays was &lsquo;feigning
  illness.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why did Southby call him a traitor?&rdquo; I said suspiciously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On exceedingly good grounds,&rdquo; said my friend. &ldquo;Suppose
  you had broken prison in all innocence, and your friend sent his car for you
  and it took you back there? Suppose your friend offered to get you away in
  his yacht, and it took the wrong course, till overtaken by a motor-boat?
  Suppose Southby was trying to get to Sussex, and Kennington always headed him
  off towards Cornwall or Ireland or Normandy, what would you expect Southby to
  call him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;what would you call him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Father Brown, &ldquo;I call him a hero.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I peered at his rather featureless face through the moony twilight; and
  then he suddenly rose and paced the path with the impatience of a
  schoolboy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I could put pen to paper, I would write the best adventure story
  ever written about this. Was there ever such a situation? Southby was kicked
  backwards and forwards, as unconscious as a football, between two very able
  and vigorous men, one of whom wanted to make the footprints point towards the
  guilty sister, while the other wanted to twist the feet away at every turn.
  And Southby thought the friend of his house was his enemy, and the destroyer
  of his house his friend. The two that knew must fight in silence, for Mester
  could not speak without warning Southby, and Kennington could not speak
  without denouncing Evelyn. It is clear from Southby&rsquo;s words, about
  false friends and the sea, that Kennington eventually kidnapped Southby in a
  yacht, but lord knows in how many tangled woods, or river islands, or lanes
  leading nowhere, the same fight was fought; the fugitive and detective trying
  to keep the trail, the traitor and true lover trying to confuse it. When
  Mester won, and his men gathered round this house, the captain could do no
  more than come here and offer his help, but Evelyn would not open the door to
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because she had the fine side of fear as well as the bad
  side,&rdquo; said Father Brown. &ldquo;&lsquo;Not a little afraid of
  life,&rsquo; you said, with great penetration. She was afraid to go to
  prison; but, to her honour, she was afraid to get married, too. It is a type
  produced by all this refinement. My friend, I want to tell you and all your
  modern world a secret. You will never get to the good in people till you have
  been through the bad in them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After a moment he added that we ought to be returning to the house, and
  walked yet more briskly in that direction.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he remarked, as he did so, &ldquo;the packet of
  banknotes you took through to Southby was only to help him away and spare him
  Evelyn&rsquo;s arrest. Mester&rsquo;s not a bad fellow for a &rsquo;tec. But
  she realised her danger, and was trying to get into the Priest&rsquo;s
  Room.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I was still brooding on the queer case of Kennington.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was not the glove found?&rdquo; 1 asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was not the window broken?&rdquo; he asked in return. &ldquo;A
  man&rsquo;s glove twisted properly and loaded with nine pounds in gold, and
  probably a letter as well, will break most windows if it is slung by a man
  who has been a bowler. Of course, there was a note. And, of course, the note
  was imprudent. It left money for escape, and left the proofs of what she was
  escaping from.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And then what happened to her?&rdquo; I asked dully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Something of what happened to you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You also
  found the secret door difficult to open from outside. You also caught up that
  crooked curtain-rod or window-bar to beat on it. You also saw the door
  opening slowly from within. But you did not see what she saw.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what did she see?&rdquo; I said at last.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She saw the man she had wronged most,&rdquo; said Father Brown.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean Southby?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Southby has shown heroic virtue, and he
  is happy. The man she wronged most was a man who had never had, or tried to
  have, more than one virtue&mdash;a kind of acrid justice. And she had made
  him unjust all his life&mdash;made him pamper the wicked woman and ruin the
  righteous man. You told me in your notes that he often hid in the
  Priest&rsquo;s Room, to discover who was faithful or unfaithful. This time he
  came out holding a sword left in that room in the days when men hunted my
  religion. He found the letter, but, of course, he destroyed it after he had
  done&mdash;what he did. Yes, old friend, I can feel the horror on your face
  without seeing it. But, indeed, you modern people do not know how many kinds
  of men there are in the world. I am not talking of approval, but of
  sympathy&mdash;the sort of sympathy I give to Evelyn Donnington. Have you no
  sympathy with cold, barbaric justice, or with the awful appeasements of such
  an intellectual appetite? Have you no sympathy with the Brutus who killed his
  friend? Have you no sympathy with the monarch who killed his son? Have you no
  sympathy with Virginius, who killed&mdash;. But I think we must go in
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>We mounted the stairs in silence, but my surging soul expected some scene
  surpassing all the scenes of that tower. And in a sense I had it. The room
  was empty, save for Wellman, who stood behind an empty chair as impassively
  as if there had been a thousand guests.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They have sent for Dr. Browning, sir,&rdquo; he said in colourless
  tones.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;There was no question
  about the death?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he said, with a slight cough; &ldquo;Dr. Browning
  required another doctor to be sent from Chichester, and they took Sir Borrow
  away.&rdquo;</p>
