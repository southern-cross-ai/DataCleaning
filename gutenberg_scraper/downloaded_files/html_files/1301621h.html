  <h3>First published in <i>Oriental Stories</i>, Autumn 1931</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="blurb">A vivid tale of the Manchu conquest of China, and the
  fulfillment of the old Ming prophecy, when blood ran red in Peking</p>

  <p class="blurb">&ldquo;As the Manchus began in Chung Kuo with a child in
  arms, so, with a child in arms, shall their dynasty pass from the memory of
  man.&rdquo;<br></p>

  <p class="blurb">&mdash;An ancient Chinese prophecy embodied in what was
  known as <i>The Song of the Cakes</i>.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">AS THE great gate swung reluctantly open between the
  white-battlemented earthen walls, Mangu ran forward with a great shout. Close at
  his heels poured in multitudinous flood the conquering horde of the Chin
  Tatars. The iron discipline of the march, the toil and danger of many
  battles, was forgotten. These lean, hard-bitten warriors from the frozen
  plains of the north saw before them only the incredible loot to be taken in
  this greatest city of the world.</p>

  <p>Peking&mdash;it was a name to conjure with! All Asia resounded with tales
  of its splendid palaces, the bazars piled high with gleaming silks, with soft
  sheened rugs from Ispahan, sandalwood, myrrh and frankincense from Ind, gold
  and precious gems that came by caravan from Samarkand.</p>

  <p>For this they had marched and fought, these Manchu nomads, under their
  great Lord, the mighty T&rsquo;ai Tsung. The city of Kubla Khan, the vast
  shining city, lay open before them, weakly abandoned by the eunuch-ridden
  Mings. Mangu spat his scorn as he thought of those womanish rulers.</p>

  <p>The fierce warriors scattered through the crooked narrow streets. Bales of
  silken stuffs came tumbling out of windows, the shrieks of the hapless
  inhabitants rose high above the shouts of the loot-maddened soldiery.</p>

  <p>But with clenched teeth and eager eyes Mangu ran steadily along through
  the narrow ways. Not for him the petty plunder that satisfied his rude
  command. Shaggy untaught fighters to whom the sweepings of the bazars seemed
  untold wealth.</p>

  <p>Was he not Mangu, captain of a thousand men, whom the mighty Khan himself
  had deigned to favor with approval at the last great battle at Shanhaikuan?
  Greater spoil awaited him. His eye gleamed at the thought.</p>

  <p>As he burst into the great open square, the Tatar&rsquo;s curved sword
  leaped like a live thing into his hand. Ahead, down the straight vista, rose
  the lofty palace of the Mings, the king&rsquo;s treasure-house that was his
  goal.</p>

  <p>But in front of the huge entrance gate massed a group of men, and the
  sunlight glinted on their weapons&mdash;Ming soldiers, barring the way into
  the sacred domain of their Emperor, Ts&rsquo;ung Ch&rsquo;eng. Mangu grew
  furious at the sight. &ldquo;Chinese dogs,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;dare you
  dispute with arms the passage of a Manchu warrior? Know you not the city has
  yielded to the might of our great Khan, T&rsquo;ai Tsung?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was no answer, but the hundred men ranged threateningly into battle
  order. Mangu, Captain of a Thousand, glanced behind him. Of the great company
  that had broken through the outer walls, only a handful, a bare dozen, had
  kept pace with him. The confused shouting from the conquered city, the
  piercing shrieks of tortured women, the cries of loot-maddened soldiery, told
  their dread tale.</p>

  <p>But neither fear nor caution had ever once disturbed the recklessness of
  the Manchu captain. He plunged forward shouting. &ldquo;Ho, men of the Chin
  Tatars, follow me to crush these weak-kneed eunuchs.&rdquo; The brawny nomads
  from the frozen tundras of the north, nostrils dilated, threw themselves
  after their leader. In an instant the battle was joined. Great curved swords
  clashed in midair, the contestants fought with bared teeth and
  fury-distorted faces. The square resounded with the shrieks of dying men.</p>

  <p>Mangu felt the blood coursing through his veins like heady wine. A great
  exultation seized him. Ha! this was living! Good sword in hand, to cut and
  slash and parry, to feel the bite of his steel in yielding flesh, to glare
  one moment into the hate-crazed eyes of his enemy, the next to see them
  dulled in death!</p>

  <p>As he laid about him, cutting a wide swath through the heaving mass, he
  sang a song that breathed the fierceness of his race. And still the blood-red
  weapon bit and slew!</p>

  <p>The fight was over. The scattered remnants of the Mings fled aghast from
  this Tatar demon. Regretfully he turned, to marshal his men. The shout of
  victory died on his lips. Of his comrades, not one was alive. Mingled with
  the heaps of Chinese dead, sprawled their corpses. Unknowing, he had fought
  alone at the end, and won!</p>

  <p>Mangu shrugged his shoulders. Once more his face turned to the great gate.
  His long sword battered on the portals.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Open, ye spawn of misbegotten fathers!&rdquo; he roared.
  &ldquo;Open, or I&rsquo;ll rip the steaming entrails out of your womanish
  bodies, and throw them to the birds of heaven.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The threat was effective. The watchers in the blue-tiled towers had
  witnessed the fierce prowess of this northern devil. The gate swung slowly
  open, the trembling people cast themselves prostrate before the arrogant
  captain. &ldquo;Have mercy, Oh Lord of a thousand moons,&rdquo; they cried in
  gray fear; &ldquo;have mercy on us, who eat the dust beneath your
  all-conquering feet. We are but the most insignificant of earth&rsquo;s
  creatures.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mangu glanced contemptuously at the groveling figures, spurned with his
  foot the nearest, but did not deign an answer. They were not worthy even of
  death at his hands.</p>

  <p>Before him stretched a fabulous vista of flowery delights. His eye passed
  it over impatiently. A figure dangling from a ginko tree caught his eye. It
  swung idly in the breeze, dressed in royal robes. His lips curled. So the
  Ming Emperor had taken the easy way out! And still his eye roved on. It
  settled on a huge fantastic structure, topped by three yellow-tiled curving
  roofs. That was it&mdash;the Temple of Heaven! In its depths, he knew, was
  secreted the incalculable wealth of the Mings. No lesser treasure would be
  his. Before the riotous, looting soldiers could penetrate thus far, he would
  have reaped the reward of his daring.</p>

  <p>HE RACED up the great stone steps, flung into the dim lit portals. Through
  corridor after corridor he went, from one vast room to another, seeking the
  hidden treasure. No sign of it anywhere. He fumed and raged. At any moment
  the lusting hordes would be pouring in, and the great chance gone. If only he
  could find some lurking courtier, to force the secret from his unwilling
  mouth! But the great temple was deserted.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he whirled. A faint shrieking came to him, queerly strangled. He
  dashed through door on door, following the sounds. They were gurgling now,
  gasping throaty noises. A jade-green door intervened. It was bolted. With a
  heave of his shoulders, it crashed, and Mangu was precipitated into a scene
  of horror.</p>

  <p>Sunk on the ground, in a cowering shapeless mass, was an ancient priest,
  his claw-like hands raised in trembling supplication, his incredibly wrinkled
  parchment face a mask of terror. Over him bent grimly, threateningly, three
  nobles of the Chinese court. So wrapped were they in the business at hand
  that they did not notice the interruption of the Manchu warrior.</p>

  <p>A brazier of charcoal glowed fiery red. The point of a dagger was buried
  among the embers. One of the nobles bent an evil brow upon the terror-struck
  old priest. &ldquo;Oh T&rsquo;ai Lung, our patience is nigh exhausted. We
  know you have the talisman hidden. Deliver it to us, or else what has been
  done to you is but the merest taste of what is yet to come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old man&rsquo;s hands fluttered feebly. &ldquo;I have it not, I tell
  you. I know not where it is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You lie. The Emperor himself, before he went to his heavenly
  ancestors, told us that you, the Priest of the Temple, were its sole
  guardian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The answer came in a feeble whisper. &ldquo;It is not true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well then, on your own head be it.&rdquo; The noble snatched
  the heated dagger out of the flame, raised it.</p>

  <p>The shriek of the tortured man brought Mangu to his senses. Out flashed
  his sword, and with the dreaded Tatar cry on his lips, he launched forward to
  the attack. The startled conspirators had no chance for their lives. In a
  trice they were weltering in pools of blood.</p>

  <p>The withered priest raised his eyes to his unexpected deliverer in an
  ecstasy of thankfulness. What he saw caused him to cower in the extremity of
  despair. For the dreaded Manchu who towered over him transfixed him with
  cold, piercing eyes. Mangu had not been actuated by feelings of pity or mercy
  when he had rescued this worthless carcass from his torturers. What mattered
  one member of the accursed race, more or less?</p>

  <p>But he had heard enough to convince him that this old man could divulge
  the hiding place of the wealth he was convinced reposed somewhere in the
  temple.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, old man,&rdquo; he said harshly, &ldquo;some miserable years
  of life have been saved to you. Where is the hidden treasure of the Mings?
  Tell me quickly, or it will be the worse for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The wretched priest shrank from his new tormentor. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo;
  he moaned, &ldquo;I do not know. I swear it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mangu set his teeth with a snap. &ldquo;By the demons of the underworld,
  if you do not speak, and speak now, I know a way to loose that useless tongue
  of yours.&rdquo; He lifted the glowing dagger significantly. &ldquo;Now will
  you tell me the secret place where the royal gems are stored?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The set, obdurate face of the ancient one underwent a surprising
  transformation. &ldquo;The gems, say you? I thought you meant&mdash;&rdquo;
  Abruptly he ceased.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Meant what, food for crows?&rdquo; the Tatar asked curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, they were but idle words, O magnificent Lord. The jewels, said
  you?&rdquo; He was fawning slimily on Mangu. &ldquo;Grant me but my few
  remaining years, and I shall deliver undreamt-of riches into your noble
  hands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do as you promise, and I shall not harm you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Under the Manchu&rsquo;s watchful eyes, the old priest tottered to his
  feet, staggered slowly, painfully to the smooth surface of the wall. Bending
  over, he pressed something, and a great panel slid silently open.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Behold, O mighty one, the royal jewels of the Mings. You and all
  your descendants shall loll in luxurious ease.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Even in the gloom of the recess, Mangu saw the lambent glow and sparkle of
  the heaped-up gems. Joyfully he thrust his hands in, brought out great
  handfuls of the glittering stones. A fierce emotion swept him. In his grasp
  was wealth beyond all avarice; blood-red rubies large as pigeons&rsquo; eggs,
  green emeralds like the unfathomable sea, diamonds that flashed and
  coruscated, curiously carved amethysts and smooth jade.</p>

  <p>The Manchu captain stuffed the folds of his garments to the bursting
  point. He could carry no more. &ldquo;Close the hidden chamber,&rdquo; he
  ordered, &ldquo;and beware, lest you tell any other of its secret.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The priest hurried to obey, watched the burly figure with crafty,
  enigmatic eyes. Mangu cast a hasty glance around, and moved to the door.</p>

  <p>It was time to go. Already could be heard the shouts of the invading
  soldiery, hot on the scent. The old priest stiffened at the noise. Terror
  seared him as he harkened. He ran after the retreating warrior, grasped him
  by his garment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Most noble one,&rdquo; he panted, &ldquo;you promised me my
  life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Manchu shook off the feeble clutch. &ldquo;That I did, and I have kept
  my promise. I have not slain you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, protector, but I hear your comrades in the distance. Soon they
  will be here, and they will kill me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What business is that of mine?&rdquo; Mangu responded
  indifferently. &ldquo;I but promised not to harm you, and that I shall
  not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old man was beside himself with fear. &ldquo;Do not abandon me. Mercy,
  mercy!&rdquo; he shrieked.</p>

  <p>MANGU stared curiously at this ancient creature who clung so tenaciously
  to life. Life was only for the young and lusty who could enjoy it to the
  full, not for dotards. He shrugged and moved on.</p>

  <p>The shouts came nearer, mingled now and then with shrill screams. The
  priest was palsied. Animal moans burst from him; he glared wildly about.</p>

  <p>Ah, a thought struck him. The crafty look crept back into his eyes. He ran
  with amazing speed after the retreating Manchu, caught up with him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Great captain,&rdquo; his cracked voice trembled in its urgency,
  &ldquo;take me to your leader, the Lord of all the Manchus. I have word for
  him that is of the greatest purport.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mangu stopped abruptly, stared at the Ming in bewilderment. &ldquo;What is
  this thing that the most high T&rsquo;ai Tsung needs must hear it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is for his ears alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Manchu was impatient. &ldquo;Harken, old man, you impose upon my good
  nature. The great Khan grants no audience to the idle vaporings of such as
  you. If you do not cease from troubling me with your foul clamor, I shall be
  tempted to forget my promise, and myself separate your worthless head from
  its scrawny neck. Begone, ere it be too late!&rdquo; he concluded
  sternly.</p>

  <p>But the old man was not to be thus thrust aside.</p>

  <p>The cries of the looting soldiery were approaching dangerously near. In
  his terrible fear, he clung to this one ray of hope in spite of threats of
  violence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Most noble captain, I beg you&mdash;hear me!&rdquo; His voice rose
  to a thin shriek. &ldquo;The life of your Lord, the very fate of your people,
  depend on what I have to say. I, only I, can save you all! Take me to him
  safely. He shall reward you greatly, I promise you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mangu, in spite of himself, was impressed by the desperate urging of this
  strange creature. Perchance there was something in what the old fool
  said.</p>

  <p>As he stood there musing, the door burst open mid a great clamor and
  shouting, and a mob of drunken soldiers poured through the gap. They were
  staggering under silken robes, golden goblets helmeted their heads, precious
  ornaments of jade dangled from their persons.</p>

  <p>The foremost of the rioters beheld the ancient Ming priest. With joyous
  cries, they pounced upon him, seized him with ungentle hands. &ldquo;O
  outlived reptile of accursed lineage, give us your hidden treasures, or we
  slit your wizened throat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The priest struggled feebly in his captors&rsquo; grasp, crying feebly on
  the Manchu captain. &ldquo;Save me, the Emperor will reward you,&rdquo; he
  gasped.</p>

  <p>Mangu strode forward with naked weapon. He thrust his way vigorously
  through the reeling mob, sent the priest&rsquo;s tormentors spinning with the
  flat of his sword. &ldquo;Hence, men of the Chin Tatars! This man is my
  prisoner. I take him to T&rsquo;ai Tsung. Stand aside and let him
  be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Angry growls arose from the sobered soldiers, mutterings that needed only
  a spark to translate into action. But Mangu faced them haughtily, eyes
  flashing fire. Someone recognized him as a Captain of a Thousand. Terrible
  would be the wrath of their Lord if they attacked an officer.</p>

  <p>So they stood aside with hate-filled eyes and let the proud captain pass.
  The Ming slunk by, hugging closely the burly form of his rescuer.</p>

  <p><br><br>T'AI TSUNG, Lord of the Chin Tatars, conqueror of Chung Kuo, the
  Middle Kingdom, sat in state on a throne in the great royal tent pitched in
  front of the battlemented walls.</p>

  <p>A great burly figure, his huge knotted muscles bulged incongruously in the
  flowered silks of the despoiled Mings. The high slant cheekbones, the
  generous spacing between the coal-black eyes that could flash terribly on
  occasion, the bold aquiline nose with flaring nostrils marked him as of the
  race of Timur and Jingis. The broad forehead, the proud, haughty pose of the
  head, the black wiry beard proclaimed one accustomed to command, whose least
  whim was law. But the great fleshy lips that gleamed redly under the short
  curling mustache, the feeling of exuberant life that emanated from the
  vigorous body, were proof enough that he shrank not from the flesh-pots.</p>

  <p>A hard rider, a warrior to whom the fierce clash of weapons was as the
  breath of life, a mighty feaster and drinker after the swink and toil of
  battle&mdash;such was the great Khan.</p>

  <p>Even now he was lolling on his throne, a goblet filled with the pale rice
  wine of the Chinese gurgling down his throat, while two huge bronzed slaves
  waved great fans rhythmically before the royal presence. Already was he aping
  the luxuriousness of the conquered race.</p>

  <p>An interminable string of weeping, frightened Chinese maidens passed in
  review before him. Those who pleased his fancy he designated by a nod. They
  were immediately hurried to the women&rsquo;s quarters of the royal tent.</p>

  <p>The sturdy gruff Manchu nobles saw, and liked it not.
  &ldquo;Methinks,&rdquo; grumbled one to his comrade, &ldquo;our Lord forgets
  the simple virtues of our race. He would become as one of these degenerate
  Mings. Look at him being fanned like a very woman, and mincing with perfumed
  water. Pah.&rdquo; The indignant chieftain spat his honest wrath.</p>

  <p>His comrades gazed apprehensively around. &ldquo;Ssh,&rdquo; he whispered,
  &ldquo;it would not be healthy to be overheard. I care not for such pretty
  danglings myself, but rest assured, our Khan is no milksop. When the occasion
  arises, he will once more prove himself the mighty warrior he has been in the
  past.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The other shrugged his shoulders skeptically.</p>

  <p>A sudden commotion at the entrance to the great silken tent brought the
  grumbling to a halt. A cowering, decrepit figure was dragged into the sacred
  presence by one attired in the trappings of a Captain of a Thousand.</p>

  <p>Mangu prostrated himself deeply before his dread Lord. The priest, half
  dead with fright, groveled with outstretched arms in the dirt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hear, oh mighty one, greater than Timurlane and Jingis Khan. This
  vile carcass I have brought to you is a priest of the Ming women, who
  pretends he has news of great import, touching your most sacred life. It was
  for this I saved him from the death he merited. I know not whether he in full
  sooth knows aught, or if he be a rank impostor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>T&rsquo;ai Tsung bent a black brow on the groveling wretch. &ldquo;What
  have such as you to say that concerns me, the Son of Heaven? Speak, and woe
  betide you if it be idle chatter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Chinese priest raised himself, trembling. &ldquo;All-powerful one,
  whom Heaven itself protects, my story is for your ears alone. When told you
  would not wish it to be in others&rsquo; memories.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mangu sprang forward. &ldquo;Nay, oh Lord, heed him not,&rdquo; he
  clamored; &ldquo;this misbegotten shape of evil may be possessed of magic
  powers, and seek to work unholy enchantments on your sacred self.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; The Emperor&rsquo;s voice was terrible. &ldquo;Think
  you that I, a descendant of the Sky, need fear his feeble powers? Old man, it
  shall be as you wish. Let one remove himself from our presence at once,
  except my Nubian mutes, and Mangu, who shall keep the door of the
  tent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With backward steps and numerous bows, the Manchu nobles hastened to go,
  lest their ruler&rsquo;s wrath blight irrevocably. Only Mangu remained to
  guard the door, and the giant slaves ranged on either side of the throne,
  great curved swords on ebony shoulders.</p>

  <p>The Khan frowned blackly. &ldquo;You have gained your audience. If your
  story meets not with my approval, you will curse the day that you were born.
  Speak!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The shrunken Chinaman had somewhat regained his confidence. He fumbled in
  the folds of his garments. Mangu watched with hawk-like eyes, his hand on the
  hilt of his sword, his body tensed to spring at the slightest untoward
  sign.</p>

  <p>The priest drew out a small object, held it in the palm of his bony hand.
  Mangu stared at it from his vantage-point.</p>

  <p>A carved bit of jade the size of a robin&rsquo;s egg. The soft satiny
  sheen of its green, the infinite delicacy of its carving, awakened covetous
  desires in the captain&rsquo;s breast. &ldquo;The old scoundrel,&rdquo; he
  raged inwardly, &ldquo;to have tricked and bemocked me thus! Had I but known
  this rare ornament was on his worthless person, I had slit his throat from
  ear to ear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Once more his fascinated eyes strayed to the splendor and glory of it. A
  magnificent throne, on which, in divine majesty, sat a child, clad in the
  resplendent robes of an Emperor of the Celestial Kingdom. Around the dais on
  which the throne was set, could be descried, deep graven, a train of
  marvelously minute Chinese characters. The whole was encircled by a sinuous
  dragon, its scaly body seemingly instinct with life.</p>

  <p>T&rsquo;ai Tsung had half arisen from his throne, staring strangely at the
  palely glowing gem. Even the giant mutes held unwonted gleams in their
  mask-like faces.</p>

  <p>The Emperor&rsquo;s voice was queer, hoarse, when he spoke. &ldquo;Give it
  to me&mdash;at once.&rdquo; He stretched out an imperious hand.</p>

  <p>THE PRIEST of the Mings hastened to obey. The Manchu Lord held the
  precious thing in a hand that shook. Long he gazed into the green depths, as
  into a crystal ball that mirrors the future darkly. He seemed in the grip of
  a mighty emotion, as if the bit of jade held in its translucence a powerful
  magic, a magic that could sway his destiny, and the fate of nations.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What inner meaning holds this strange device? What secret power
  does it contain?&rdquo; he demanded, half in awe.</p>

  <p>The withered priest prostrated himself once more before the feet of the
  conqueror.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Great Son of the Morning,&rdquo; he intoned, in the voice of one
  long dead, &ldquo;in your all-wisdom you have felt the spell. Now I see the
  prophecy was true, though I mocked it when first it was revealed to me. Know
  then, oh Chosen One, this curiously carved jade was given me many, many years
  ago, by an aged lama from Tibet, whom I succored when he was weary with
  travel and the harsh burden of life.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Before he departed to his ancestors, he entrusted it to my care,
  and told me of an ancient prophecy. Some day, he said, a race of conquerors
  would come out of the north like a cloud of locusts, and the fair land of
  Chung Kuo would be harried with fire and steel. If, perchance, the jade
  Throne and Child should come into the hands of the conqueror, then the
  prophecy would be fulfilled. &lsquo;Let but a Child, a babe of their race, be
  seated on the Dragon Throne, and he and his descendants shall be Emperors of
  China. The dynasty he founded,&rsquo; so ran the prophecy, &lsquo;shall
  blossom as the lotus blooms, and be mighty rulers in the land, but only as
  long as the magic jade is safely held. Should it ever pass out of their
  hands, then calamity shall come to pass. The great dynasty shall end, and
  Chung Kuo be wrested from their dominion.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Long years I held it secretly, nor said aught to anyone. But
  yesterday, when your victorious army was hammering at the gates, and the city
  was surrendered, I lost what little wits I had. In my utter folly, I spoke of
  it to Ts&rsquo;ung Ch&rsquo;eng, who has since gained the peace beyond. I
  recited the tale, unthinking. He demanded of me the jade, vowing that he
  would break it into a thousand bits, even as he would dash your power to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I dared not say nay to my Emperor, but I knew the truth. Heaven had
  spoken, and it were sacrilege to defy its decrees. Nor I nor the Emperor
  himself could change unalterable fate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quickly I thought what I must do. Pretending utter submission, I
  promised to bring it immediately. Instead, I hastened to my chamber, secreted
  the precious amulet on my person, and hid in a place I alone knew of, from
  the wrath of Ts&rsquo;ung Ch&rsquo;eng.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This morning I ventured forth, to bring the jade to your august
  self, deeming the Mings fled and the temple deserted. But a band of
  courtiers, to whom Ts&rsquo;ung Ch&rsquo;eng had delegated the search for me,
  waylaid me unawares. I refused to talk, and I was being put to the torture
  when your captain rescued me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mangu leaned forward anxiously. Was the old devil going on to tell of the
  cache of jewels, and his rifling of it? But the priest had ceased, and Mangu
  relaxed in great relief.</p>

  <p>Again with fascinated eyes, T&rsquo;ai Tsung gazed into the jade&rsquo;s
  green depths. To Mangu it seemed as though a subtle emanation irradiated
  through the great yellow tent.</p>

  <p>The great conqueror pondered long the curious prophecy. The wine goblet
  dangled in his hand, the spilled amber fluid formed little pools beside the
  throne. Mangu watched with bated breath. When the silence had lain so long in
  the tent that speech seemed a thing forgotten, T&rsquo;ai Tsung raised his
  head. There was that in the black-bearded countenance that sent queer little
  shivers through the bowels of the Manchu warrior.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Old man,&rdquo; he said to the bearer of the jade, &ldquo;you have
  spoken truly. The ancient prophecy is now fulfilled.&rdquo; Mangu started.
  &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; he told himself excitedly, &ldquo;the Emperor is mistaken.
  A child in arms must sit on the throne, so ran the prophecy. Has he
  forgotten, or heeded not?&rdquo; He was on the verge of blurting out, when he
  stopped, in cold sweat at his narrow escape. T&rsquo;ai Tsung followed a very
  simple method in disposing of annoying interruptions. The captain shrank back
  hastily, but the Emperor had not heeded the gesture. He was still speaking.
  &ldquo;The Throne and Child is in our hands, and no power on earth, no demon
  of the air, shall wrest it from our grasp. Forever shall it stay with us, and
  forever shall the dynasty of T&rsquo;ai Tsung reign in the land of Chung
  Kuo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; his voice was vibrant with curious emotion, &ldquo;my
  race, the issue of my loins shall rule this land. None other, do you
  understand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was that in his glance that bespoke a desperate resolve. Mangu
  wondered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As for you,&rdquo; he bent a strange look on the bowed figure
  before him, &ldquo;it is but meet that you be fitly rewarded for your
  devotion. I promise you your wildest desires shall be more than quenched. The
  Manchus are not niggardly in their bounty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He clapped his hands. &ldquo;Ho, Mangu, call in my nobles. Inform my
  treasurer to bring in caskets of gold and jewels&mdash;yea, many of them, and
  cause my infant son, Shun Chih, to be escorted into my presence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The burly Manchu hastened to obey, the while gritting his teeth in an
  ecstasy of bitterness and rage. Curse the lying dog! He, Mangu, had been
  tricked like a very child. The precious jade would have been his, had he but
  wit enough to search the cunning priest. Then his would have been the rewards
  from a grateful Emperor! Yet no sign of his inner turmoil was betrayed by his
  impassive countenance as he gave the required orders.</p>

  <p>MANGU reentered, and bent low before his lord. The priest stood a little
  to the side, absorbed in thought. &ldquo;Oh Heavenly One, it has been done
  even as you have commanded. In but a little while, the nobles of our realm
  shall gather here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>T&rsquo;ai Tsung eyed him keenly. &ldquo;Come hither,&rdquo; he ordered,
  &ldquo;I have somewhat to say to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mangu, startled out of his bitterness, hesitated, moved forward
  uncertainly. Had the devil spawn then betrayed him, and the stolen treasure?
  Already he felt the keen edge of the executioner&rsquo;s ax cold against the
  nape of his neck.</p>

  <p>T&rsquo;ai Tsung searched him with eyes that seared. Mangu dared not look
  up.</p>

  <p>The voice of doom was in his ears. &ldquo;Come closer.&rdquo; Mechanically
  he approached until only inches separated him from his sovereign.</p>

  <p>What were these words, whispered low so that only he could hear? Hardly
  could he grasp the full import&mdash;yet as he harkened, every nerve
  a-tingle, a vast relief flooded o&rsquo;er him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; concluded the Khan in barely audible whisper,
  &ldquo;I make you custodian of the Jade Throne and Child, token of a mighty
  dynasty. No one but you knows its secret. Guard the talisman with your life.
  Let not the slightest whisper of its purport escape you. Your line and
  lineage shall be its hereditary protectors. Take it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In his bewilderment, the Tatar captain felt the cool silky jade in his
  clenched palm. Without knowing what he did, he slipped it into the pouch of
  his leather garment.</p>

  <p>The Emperor stepped back. &ldquo;Go back to your post,&rdquo; he spoke
  loudly.</p>

  <p>Mangu was conscious of a great elation. His head was high. His Lord had
  singled him out for signal honor. He would prove worthy of the trust!</p>

  <p>While this passed, the great tent had slowly crowded with the warrior
  Manchu nobility. They were buzzing with excitement at the unwonted summons.
  The set, strained look on their ruler&rsquo;s face was proof enough of the
  importance of the occasion. Before the throne were open caskets, heaped with
  flashing gems and gold coins, a princely ransom. And who was that strange
  figure, that incredibly old Chinaman, standing humbly in the cleared space,
  yet with a crafty smirk on him. Shun Chih, a grave little lad of six,
  wide-eyed in childish bewilderment at sight of the crowded tent, sat next to his
  father. The great Khan&rsquo;s arm encircled him with a caress that was tight
  in its intensity. At least some few remembered the fierce clutch when they
  thought afterward.</p>

  <p>When the buzz of expectancy had risen to fever heat, T&rsquo;ai Tsung rose
  proudly from his throne. The haughty eagle of the North was in the grip of
  some strong emotion, yet no one could detect a tremor in the cold, even
  voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hear me, ye nobles of an ancient race. Our task is ended. All Chung
  Kuo lies prostrate under our conquering tread. We are the Lords of the World,
  and what we have conquered, we shall hold. The race of T&rsquo;ai Tsung shall
  rule forever from the frozen ocean to the heated waters of the
  south.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The fierce Manchus clashed their weapons and shouted approbation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Today,&rdquo; he continued, a great exaltation transfiguring the
  strained features, &ldquo;I have received news of the happiest
  augury.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All eyes turned curiously, wonderingly to the bowed figure of the
  Ming.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And now this priest, this servant of the Mings, shall receive his
  reward for the great service he has done me. Let it not be said that
  T&rsquo;ai Tsung does not show liberality.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O priest of the Mings, here are caskets of jewels, of golden coins
  and ornaments. These are yours for your tale. Take them!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The shrunken face lit up with a covetous leer as it beheld the great
  treasure. &ldquo;Lord of Lords,&rdquo; he cackled, &ldquo;for your
  munificence to this poor unworthy creature your name shall resound through
  the ages.&rdquo; A murmur passed through the assemblage. Glorious indeed must
  have been the news borne by the ancient to have merited such largess!</p>

  <p>The Emperor gazed at the old man strangely. &ldquo;You have your reward.
  You have well earned it. And now,&rdquo; a peculiar note crept into the
  passionless tones, &ldquo;lest you disclose the secret you have unfolded to
  me, you must&mdash;die!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As the fatal words penetrated the old man&rsquo;s consciousness, the smirk
  of satisfied greed gave way to deathly terror. &ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; he
  gasped.</p>

  <p>At an imperceptible gesture from the Emperor, one of the giant slaves
  stepped forward. The huge sword curved flashing through the air. The
  skull-like head bounded across the hall; the shrunken bloodless body collapsed
  gently into a shapeless mass.</p>

  <p>The Manchu nobles murmured audible delight. They could not grasp the full
  purport of the drama, but the sight of an enemy&rsquo;s discomfiture was
  pleasing to robust tastes.</p>

  <p>Once more T&rsquo;ai Tsung spoke. &ldquo;Manchus!&rdquo; his great voice
  vibrated. &ldquo;Behold my son, Shun Chih!&rdquo; He raised the little boy
  high in his arms. &ldquo;Do you swear to hold him as your ruler, and his son
  after him, on my death?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Instantly the great enclosure was filled with leaping swords, while a
  thousand lusty voices swelled the great shout. &ldquo;We do, we do. Long live
  T&rsquo;ai Tsung, and Shun Chih, after him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Emperor waited for the clamor to subside, his hawk face cold and
  impassive as ever. His thoughts were his own.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have sworn. On my death, Shun Chih is to be Emperor of Chung
  Kuo, and I, T&rsquo;ai Tsung, shall sire a mighty dynasty. So is it
  written.&rdquo; A moment&rsquo;s silence. The fierce face of the Khan was
  convulsed with some inward strife. He hesitated. The nobles leaned forward.
  They sensed impending drama. They saw their Lord gather himself together with
  a mighty effort. Turning to the child, he thrust out his hand dramatically.
  &ldquo;Behold, O nobles of the Chin Tatars, your Emperor. Protect and follow
  him! The prophecy is fulfilled!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>What happened then occurred with such lightning rapidity that no two of
  the startled onlookers could ever afterward agree on the details.</p>

  <p>A sword flashed out of nowhere into T&rsquo;ai Tsung&rsquo;s hand. Before
  anyone could stop him, it had sunk deep into his vitals. As the dark blood
  welled out, the Emperor sank to the ground, a smile of contentment on his
  placid face.</p>

  <p>Instantly the tent was a turmoil of rushing, shouting men, but above the
  clamor was heard the thin piercing shriek of the little boy, Shun Chih.
  &ldquo;Father! Father!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A child in arms was Emperor of the Middle Kingdom!</p>

  <p>Long years afterward, Mangu, old and bent and hoar, General of Ten
  Thousand, told his son the story as he reverently placed the soft green Jade
  in his hand. &ldquo;Ah, that was a man&mdash;our Emperor. There is not his
  like on earth today.&rdquo; And he sighed wistfully.</p>
