    "Last night out at the ranch got to fooling with it, and the handle came
    off."</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">AT nine o'clock on a bright June morning Clay Garrett,
  colored, intermittent sweeper and duster of the leading bank in a large Texas
  city, opened the heavy doors that led from the street into that most marble
  of bank interiors. Two minutes later&mdash;this being also part of the
  regular schedule&mdash;Major Tellfair, white-haired but erect, crossed the
  threshold, nodded to Clay and to the boys behind the bars, and passed into
  the office where he ruled as president. There he opened his desk, lighted a
  cigar, and began the perusal of his morning paper.</p>

  <p>He had got no farther than the headlines of the first page when the door
  of his office opened and young Dick Merrill of the Silver Star Ranch came in.
  Merrill was covered with the dust he had collected on his ride in from the
  ranch that morning. Lighting his face was the Merrill smile, human and
  kindly, and it brought the major to his feet in hearty welcome.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Dick," he said. "Beautiful morning, ain't it? How are things
  out at the Silver Star?"</p>

  <p>"The Silver Star's all right," Merrill answered. "But, say, I got a
  cablegram from Bob this morning." He explored a pocket. "Here it is. I wish
  you'd read it. Bob's in Italy&mdash;at a place called Rome&mdash;over there
  among them I-talians."</p>

  <p>His tone was as disapproving as the pleasant Merrill tone could be. He
  deposited his husky length in a mahogany chair and waited for the major to
  adjust his glasses. The bank president noted the truth of Merrill's scornful
  statement as to Rome, and then read the message slowly:</p>

  <p>Cable thousand dollars immediately. Care National Express. Keep matter
  under hat, Bob.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it, major?" Merrill asked.</p>

  <p>The major smiled.</p>

  <p>"It looks to me like somebody had annexed your brother's roll," he
  replied.</p>

  <p>"That's how I figure it," Merrill said, also with a smile. "He's been in
  Italy less than a week too&mdash;they work fast, them boys. Bob had two
  thousand dollars small change, along with all his tickets, which he bought
  from this man Cook in New York. I hope they didn't clean him out of those
  too. Well, it serves him right for wandering off the range. He ain't got no
  business over on the other side."</p>

  <p>The major cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"I don't wish to seem inquisitive," he said. "But I was utterly at a loss
  to understand your brother's sudden dash for Europe, particularly at a time
  when the nations over there are engaged in the most bloody and terrible
  warfare&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A woman," interrupted Dick Merrill. "It was a woman that done it. Maybe
  you remember her&mdash;Celia Ware&mdash;she used to sing at church concerts
  hereabouts a few years back."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes, I have heard her sing," said Major Tellfair reminiscently.</p>

  <p>"You'll hear her again," said Merrill, "l reckon you don't pay much
  attention to such things, but old Bob sure was far gone on her. And she
  seemed to think a heap of him too."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," nodded the major.</p>

  <p>"But when it came to a showdown she picked her art. Wedded to music she
  was. Went over to Italy to get better acquainted with it. Bob got a letter
  from her 'bout a month back: wants to divorce her art now. Maybe it's grounds
  of non-support, maybe the war's upset her, maybe she just naturally loves old
  Bob&mdash;I don't know. Anyhow, she told him to come for her, and they're to
  be married over there: in Florence. Ain't that a devil of a sissy name for a
  town?"</p>

  <p>"It's an Italian name, I believe," responded the major. "Miss Ware struck
  me as a singularly attractive young woman. I'm sure I congratulate your
  brother most heartily."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Celia's all right," said Merrill. "How she'll pan out on a ranch I
  don't know, but she's a mighty fine girl, even if she did drag poor old Bob
  all them thousands of miles to Italy."</p>

  <p>"We must send him his thousand," mused the major. "No man wants to be
  broke on his wedding day."</p>

  <p>"Sure: dig into his account and send it along," agreed Merrill. "He's
  boss, and it's his money. Shoot it to him. Only I wish he hadn't been so
  all-fired brief. I wonder what happened. Bob's too childlike and simple to
  wander around among them I-talians. Somebody got to him. I wonder&mdash;oh,
  well&mdash;send him the money, major: I leave it to you."</p>

  <p>The major promised to attend to the matter immediately, and Dick Merrill,
  still wondering, set out for the Silver Star Ranch.</p>

  <p>There was a rumor in that Texas city to the effect that Major Tellfair was
  growing too old and forgetful for the position he held, and, unkind as this
  assertion sounds, subsequent events seemed to justify it. The gentle old
  president turned back for a moment to his newspaper. Shortly after he was
  interrupted by the cashier, who had an important matter to discuss. The
  cabled appeal from Bob Merrill slipped out of sight on his cluttered desk,
  and for two days the Texas ranchman waited forlorn in the city of Rome.</p>

  <p>He might have waited indefinitely had not Clay Garrett, the aged negro
  custodian of the bank, been a devotee of that art which has made Caruso
  wealthy. On the third day following the visit of Dick Merrill to the bank,
  Major Tellfair entered at two minutes past nine in the morning to hear Clay
  giving a spirited rendering of a favorite song. Fortunately for Bob Merrill,
  two lines of that song reached the ears of the major:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Darling&mdash;Ah am growin' ol'&mdash;<br>
  Silver threads among the gol'&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>Silver! The Silver Star Ranch! Bob Merrill's cablegram! In an agony of
  remorse the old major rushed into his office, unearthed the message, and sent
  the thousand dollars speeding toward Italy. Then he returned to sit before
  his desk in humble and pathetic contrition, while the sneers of his enemies
  regarding his age and absent-mindedness filled his thoughts. He was a most
  unhappy man.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he would not have been so unhappy had he known that by those two
  days of delay he had done Bob Merrill a most unexpected service. For he had
  caused the ranchman to break his sacred contract with Thomas Cook &amp; Son
  to leave Rome on an appointed day and thereby enabled him&mdash;</p>

  <p>But we are far, far ahead of the story. Offensive to the schools of
  short-story writing it must be when we confess that the incident already
  related bisects squarely the tale we have to tell. The most seemly thing to
  do then is to go back quietly to the beginning&mdash;back to that rainy
  Saturday morning when the little Italian liner slipped away from the
  fog-engulfed pier in the North River, New York, carrying Bob Merrill
  ultimately to his ladylove, but first to the adventure of the ebony
  stick.</p>

  <p>Though Celia Ware's letter of surrender warmed his pocket, there was a
  homesick twinge in the heart of the big ranchman as he watched the towers of
  Manhattan fade back into the mist. Little enough he had in common, it is
  true, with the great city of cabs and cabarets, but as the scene of his
  farewell to his own beloved land it suddenly took on, for him, a new and
  tender interest. The five thousand miles of restless water he was about to
  cross appalled him in prospect, and Naples, his destination, struck on his
  ears like the name of some new, unexplored planet. Nevertheless, like the
  true knight he was, where love led he followed. If you could have seen him
  there at the rail, broad-shouldered, handsome, with the look of one who would
  always be a boy at heart, you would not have wondered that in the letter now
  resting in his pocket, Celia Ware renounced forever her cherished career. In
  a hundred galleries abroad she had seen the figures of men great artists had
  thought worthy of their marble, and her waiting lover suffered in comparison
  with none of these.</p>

  <p>A wall of fog had risen now between Merrill and the country he was
  leaving, but still he stood at the rail, lonely and staring. A noise at his
  elbow brought him round, and he saw standing behind him a neatly tailored
  young man with a face so friendly and smiling that his own smile at once
  returned.</p>

  <p>"Some little disappearing act the old burg did this morning," said the
  young man, pulling his checked cap down on his head. "Now you see it and now
  you don't. This your first trip over?"</p>

  <p>"First offense," Merrill confessed, "How about you?"</p>

  <p>"My seventy-first crossing; actual count," responded the stranger with a
  bored air.</p>

  <p>Merrill gasped. "Business, eh?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Business," assented the other, a queer little look in his eyes. "As we're
  to be two weeks together on this hopeless old tub, we ought to get
  acquainted. My name is Henry Howard Fisher."</p>

  <p>Two days Merrill had spent in Manhattan, and his heart was hungry for
  companionship. Quickly he revealed his name, mentioned Texas, the Silver
  Star, and suggested a drink.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," said Mr. Fisher. "l don't touch it."</p>

  <p>"Come and have a cigar then," Merrill ordered. It developed that neither
  did the abstemious Mr. Fisher smoke. Merrill looked him over again, a trifle
  suspiciously this time. Men were not made thus in the neighborhood of the
  Silver Star. But Fisher's face was frank and winning, and he was delighted,
  he said, to accompany Merrill to the smoking room for a chat.</p>

  <p>Comfortably seated, Mr. Fisher regarded the ranchman thoughtfully while
  the latter made known his wants to a steward. Then with a some what satisfied
  air he took up, and showed himself a master of the waning art of
  conversation. They spoke of the war. Mr. Fisher touched lightly on the matter
  that was now taking him abroad. It seemed that a rich tract of land in the
  neighborhood of Naples, which he owned, had been atrociously taxed because of
  Italy's recent entry into the great conflict, and he was going over to adjust
  the matter. A terrible bore, said he, sighing. He inquired as to the route of
  Bob Merrill, and the ranchman explained how Cook, friend of tourists, had
  arranged everything in advance.</p>

  <p>"Cook picked me up this morning after breakfast in New York," he laughed,
  "and he won't drop me until after dinner on the night of the 20th of July,
  when I land back in the North River. Tickets, hotels, everything bought and
  paid for, and, you might say, in my pocket."</p>

  <p>Fisher laughed. "You might as well send your trunk," he said.</p>

  <p>The satire, however, was lost on his friendly audience. Merrill took out a
  typewritten route sheet and read from it:</p>

  <p>"Land Naples eight o'clock Saturday night, June 10, stop Grand Hotel du
  Vesuve; June 11, breakfast and lunch at hotel, take train Statione Centrally
  three o'clock p.m. for Rome, dinner on train, arrive Rome seven o'clock, stop
  Hotel Quirinal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You don't stay long in Naples," Mr. Fisher commented.</p>

  <p>"Friend." replied Bob Merrill, "I don't stay long anywhere until I get to
  Florence. Expect to do a little sight-seeing on the return trip to Naples,
  where I get a boat back home. You see, Mrs. Merrill will be with me
  then."</p>

  <p>And to this stranger he frankly told what took him abroad.</p>

  <p>"Youth on the prow and pleasure at the helm," quoted Mr. Fisher
  delightedly. "It certainly is refreshing to find somebody going abroad on a
  happy errand in these war times." He looked Merrill over again. "By the way,"
  he added, "have you been down to arrange for your seat at table, or did Cook
  do that for you too?"</p>

  <p>This was something Cook had left to Merrill's own initiative, and Mr.
  Fisher accompanied him to the dining saloon on the errand. Thus it came about
  that the ranchman and the pleasant Fisher were seated side by side at the
  same table for the crossing.</p>

  <p>The little dining saloon was crowded at that first luncheon, but it was
  the last time for many days that all its seats were filled. For it developed
  that the mist which engulfed New York was but the western fringe of a
  tremendous storm. For five days the liner struggled in the angriest of seas.
  One by one the passengers disappeared and were seen no more. Each night Bob
  Merrill's sleep was disturbed by his bright new steamer trunk rolling as the
  ship rolled back and forth, back and forth, across the floor of his narrow
  stateroom. Frequently he heard outside in the companionways the crash of
  chinaware as stewards carrying trays were hurled against the walls. It was a
  new experience for the Texan; he was awed by the power of the sea, but
  unafraid. And with a little group of the faithful he appeared three times
  daily in the dining saloon.</p>

  <p>Fisher, hero of seventy crossings, was, of course, one of that group, and
  he complimented the ranchman on his digestion. In those five days, when the
  rain was on the sea and the liner almost helpless in the wash of the waves,
  their isolation brought them very close together. They began to know each
  other by their first names. To the man from Texas his new-found friend was
  more or less a mystery. Sometimes Fisher seemed very young to him; he looked
  again, and there were many marks of age on Fisher's face. Sometimes he
  thought the stranger the frankest of men; at others he discovered a sly look
  that worried him.</p>

  <p>But Fisher's polished manner, his interesting fund of talk&mdash;which was
  but rarely of that tax on the acres of Italy which was his immediate
  worry&mdash;fascinated him as well as all the others aboard with whom the
  man came in contact. Fisher had a charming way with women; three children who
  were immune from the sickness worshiped him at sight. There was but one
  person on the boat&mdash;a little old lady who looked the sewing-circle but
  was a famous traveler&mdash;who seemed to find his courtly manners
  displeasing.</p>

  <p>Often the ranchman tried to discover some business connection of his
  friend, but in vain. "You'll find a volume of my poems on sale at Brentano's
  in New York," said Fisher one day, and thereby became an even greater mystery
  to the Texan. Indeed, save for those acres in Italy, no earthly business
  seemed to hold him.</p>

  <p>The fifth day the rain ceased, and the waves began to calm. A few of the
  suffering passengers crept cautiously on deck. "They remind me," said Bob
  Merrill to Fisher, "of old Jeb Peters, our town atheist back home, the first
  time he went into the Methodist church. Peters was willing to give the place
  a trial, but everything had to be just so."</p>

  <p>That night the moon they had all forgot crept through the clouds and
  poured its silver on the sea. After dinner Bob Merrill sat in a deck chair,
  looking out over the tossing waters. He was alone with his thoughts, which
  were of the vast dimensions of the world in which he lived. For five days
  they had plowed on, seeing nothing save one small fishing boat. For nine more
  days, over three thousand miles of water, they were still to plow. In awe and
  reverence he considered these things: how the world was so much greater than
  he had ever dreamed, how the Silver Star back there in Texas was but an
  unimportant atom in God's huge scheme of earth and water!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, through a port hole behind him, came the voices of two men in
  the lounge: "Well, well, well! Why, I got a brother in the paint business in
  Dubuque." And the answer: "Say, ain't it a small world after all." At this
  ridiculous interruption to his thoughts Bob Merrill threw back his head and
  laughed. And the little gray lady who looked so sewing-circle, striding by on
  her evening constitutional about the deck, paused before him, then dropped
  into the chair at his side. "It surely does me good to hear a laugh like
  yours," she said. "Would you mind telling me the joke?"</p>

  <p>He told her, and she joined him in his mirth.</p>

  <p>"A small world," she remarked scornfully. "I guess not. I guess I know.
  I've been traveling in it more than thirty years: just going on and on. The
  uneasy woman, boy, you see her in the flesh."</p>

  <p>"Seems to me it's dangerous for you to travel in Europe now," said
  Merrill.</p>

  <p>"I hope so," she answered. "Danger's great fun. My sister and I were
  stoned in Spain during the Spanish-American War. How Nellie did enjoy the
  thrill! She used to travel with me, Nellie did. Died last year in Australia,
  poor dear. I brought the body home, and then I started out again. It's lonely
  without her, but I can't stop. Got to go on. Russia, Turkey, China, the
  Philippines&mdash;all the countries you can name&mdash;I've been there. Can't
  stop. The uneasy woman. I'll die on the road."</p>

  <p>With wonder in his eyes, Bob Merrill, the timid traveler, gazed at the
  frail little woman beside him. She leaned closer.</p>

  <p>"Something I've been wanting to say to you," she went on. "Don't think me
  an old busybody, boy. You told me it was your first crossing. I only want to
  be of service to you. I've been on the road a long time. This&mdash;what does
  he call himself&mdash;this Henry Howard Fisher? You and he are pretty
  thick."</p>

  <p>"I reckon we are," Merrill admitted.</p>

  <p>"He's been on the road a long time too," the little woman said. "Lots of
  names he's called himself. I forget them now. But I've met up with him many
  times. What a splendid, what an inventive mind he has. What a magnificent
  crook he is!"</p>

  <p>"Crook!" said Merrill, sitting up.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," answered the woman. "Hard to believe, isn't it? Even after her
  ten thousand was gone, it was hard for my friend, Mrs. Markham, to believe.
  She'd read his poems. I have too: they're beautiful. It was hard for Joe
  Deming to believe. Joe was consul at Rio&mdash;gave this Fisher all his
  savings&mdash;five hundred. Why? Fisher asked for them: so pretty." She
  laughed. "I've seen many of them at work," she said. "Fisher is the best. Go
  on mixing with him if you like: to know him is a liberal education. But sew
  your money up tight, boy, and laugh at him if he talks business. If you do
  that, there's no reason why you shouldn't mingle with a very charming man of
  the world at little cost to yourself. I'll be going on."</p>

  <p>"Wait," cried Merrill. "I appreciate what you've done. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't thank me&mdash;think," said the little old lady, and was gone.</p>

  <p>Merrill thought. Had a man cast this slur on the honor of his new friend,
  he would have been quick and hot to defend him. But he saw in the eyes of
  this eccentric old lady nothing but sincerity and truth. She was no doubt
  quite right. She had been about a bit. She knew. His delightful companion of
  the decks and the saloon was nothing but a con man de luxe.</p>

  <p>Later that evening, during a pleasant chat with Fisher in the smoking
  room, came his opportunity to make use of his knowledge. Fisher had been
  watching while the ranchman sipped a highball&mdash;liquorless and smokeless
  himself, as always. Suddenly he leaned across the table, and his face was as
  old and worried as Merrill had ever seen it, though he sought to keep his
  tone light.</p>

  <p>"Bob," he said, "I don't mind telling you: I'm in a deuce of a hole owing
  to that land of mine near Naples. They've put a heavy tax on it&mdash;several
  thousand our money&mdash;and I can't pay. The land's worth much more than
  that, but I'll lose it if I don't come across. I've been wondering&mdash;a
  first mortgage on it for the amount of the tax&mdash;could I interest you? We
  could run out and look the land over that morning you're to spend in
  Naples&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused, for a most disconcerting smile had come upon the simple face of
  the ranchman. It was hardly what Fisher had expected.</p>

  <p>"Just a minute, Henry," said Merrill. "You and me've been pretty good
  friends. Don't you go and spoil it all. Don't you go and try to sell me no
  option on Vesuvius. Nor any first mortgage on the dead city of Pompeii."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" faltered Fisher, laughing, though his face grew a bit
  pale.</p>

  <p>"Just what I say, Henry," replied Merrill cordially. "Friends, yes. But if
  it's business you want to talk, the bars are up, Henry, the bars are up."</p>

  <p>"You question my honor&mdash;" began Fisher hotly.</p>

  <p>"Sure I do," answered Merrill. "Don't get riled. Have a drink&mdash;if
  you've been off the stuff to impress me. Have a drink and let's talk about
  art, or cattle, or poetry. But real estate&mdash;say, Henry, whose land was
  you thinking of giving me a mortgage on?"</p>

  <p>Fisher sat staring at him a long moment and then, making his decision,
  broke into a laugh.</p>

  <p>"By Gad," he said, "I like you, Bob. I'm glad you're on: it relieves me of
  the stern necessity of lifting your roll. l thought I had to do it&mdash;and,
  gosh, how I dreaded it."</p>

  <p>"Now you're talking." smiled Merrill. "I've got a letter of credit in my
  pocket for two thousand dollars, real money, along with my tickets and such.
  You've been trying for days to find out the amount: that's it. Now, Henry,
  you keep off. Let's be friends."</p>

  <p>Fisher looked at him admiringly.</p>

  <p>"You're a wise one," he said. "I didn't give you credit. I was fooled
  because you hadn't been about much. Nobody could do you. I ought to have
  known it. You're a wise one."</p>

  <p>"You flatter me," Merrill answered, "but it would be foolish to deny it's
  music to my ears. Now that our cards are all on the table, we can go on being
  friends as before. Why not, Henry?"</p>

  <p>"No reason," agreed Fisher heartily.</p>

  <p>"I will have a drink if you insist. Yes, Bob, you've called me. You're a
  good judge of men, Bob. You're safe anywhere&mdash;" He paused a moment
  thoughtfully. "Most men are as easy as children, but you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Late into the night his flattery continued. Expanding, he told of some of
  those he had swindled; random examples of the many from Rio to Dawson City,
  from Hong Kong to Gibraltar. Bob Merrill listened. He felt that, as the old
  lady of the travels had predicted, he was gaining a liberal education.</p>

  <p>The liner plodded on, into a world of sunny days and moonlit nights. To
  those who lived in that world the thought of Europe bleeding to death began
  to seem a nightmare and a delusion. The decks, the lounge, the smoking room,
  were crowded now with many men traveling on many errands. Still daily in each
  other's company, the big clean ranchman and the hero of many shady deals
  spent much of their time. Fisher spoke no more of those mythical acres in
  Italy. His tongue was often oily in praise of Merrill as a judge of men; but
  mostly he confided, as in a friend he could trust, the thrilling tale of his
  exploits by land and sea. And Merrill, who ashore would have thought often of
  the police, listened and learned.</p>

  <p>They touched one evening at Gibraltar, taking aboard several men, one or
  two of whom seemed not unknown to Fisher. At night, when the moon was high
  above the Rock, they sailed again, and there followed four days of the
  Mediterranean, with its waters now blue, now green, now purple; always
  lovely. Happy as was Merrill's errand in Italy, he grew to dread the day when
  he must step ashore. The little liner, with its endless odor of rubber
  companionway coverings, had grown to seem like home.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the fourteenth day of their journey Fisher asked to see
  the type-written page that held Cook's directions for Merrill, and he studied
  it for several minutes.</p>

  <p>"Our paths may cross again," he explained, handing it back. "It surely has
  been great to know you, Bob. A real friend&mdash;one of the few I've known.
  If I'd had somebody like you at the start, I might never have gone into this
  rotten game."</p>

  <p>Merrill put the list back into his pocket. He said nothing about meeting
  Fisher ashore. Though already dazed at thought of the strange country he was
  about to enter, it seemed best to him that he and Fisher should part forever
  at the pier. He was sure Celia would not approve of his new friend. He was
  not so sure that he himself would approve of him&mdash;on shore.</p>

  <p>Late that afternoon some clouds he had been admiring in a brilliant sky
  developed into mountain tops, and the bay which is said to be the end of
  human endeavor lay dead ahead. Breathless, for his life in the open had made
  him sensitive to the beauty of hill and sky and water, Bob Merrill stood at
  the rail. All the thrill that Columbus had got from the sight of our
  rock-bound coast, Italy was paying back to the American at that moment.</p>

  <p>Into his vision crept the hill of Posilipo, the low island of Capri. Then
  Vesuvius, crowned with its wreath of smoke, looking as the steel engravings
  had promised it should look. And finally the city of Naples, its white villas
  climbing from the water's edge up toward the gorgeous sky. Below Merrill the
  steerage, with true Latin abandon, cheered and wept. They had come home
  again. The little Italian doctor came and stood at Merrill's side. His eyes
  glowed, and he pointed.</p>

  <p>"See," he cried. "See, signor. That little patch of the white at the foot
  of Vesuve. That is my town: the town where I was born. Not in two years have
  I seen it. I go there to-night."</p>

  <p>Merrill stood, trying to realize that in this glittering, unreal landscape
  men could point out a spot as home.</p>

  <p>The liner slowed down and took aboard passengers from a small launch that
  flew the Italian flag. The ranchman hurried below; it was time for dinner,
  but, like the others he could eat little. However, Cook had commanded, so he
  made the effort. Then he went to his stateroom for the last time, to gather
  his hand baggage and tip his wistful steward. He was on the point of
  returning to the deck when the door of his stateroom opened suddenly and
  Fisher rushed in. His face was white; he trembled. He closed the door and
  leaned against it. "Bob," he cried, "I'm scared stiff. I'm sorry to have you
  see me this way. But I can't help it. I had to see you again."</p>

  <p>"What's up?" Merrill asked.</p>

  <p>"On the doctor's launch," gasped Fisher. "A woman&mdash;wife of the first
  secretary at the consulate&mdash;she was in Kyoto three years ago. I got next
  to the consul there for some real money. She's come aboard to meet friends. I
  think she saw me."</p>

  <p>He paused, very shaky.</p>

  <p>"I get this way," he apologized, "at the thought of arrest. They've never
  got me yet. But it's with me all the time, the fear: it makes my life hell.
  And when there's danger&mdash;like now&mdash;I feel all gone inside. You see,
  Bob, I'm a pretty poor thing after all. Not a man like you. I pretend, but,
  God, I'm afraid." He shuddered. "You won't see me again," he went on. "I'm
  going back in the second class, and go ashore with them. Maybe she didn't
  notice me; maybe I just imagine. But before I go, Bob, I want to say good-by
  and give you a little present. Something to remember old Fisher by."</p>

  <p>He held out a walking stick, handsome, of ebony, with a very large gold
  handle, made in the image of an elephant.</p>

  <p>"Take it," he went on quickly. "Keep it to remember Fisher by. I've
  carried it for years. I want you to have it."</p>

  <p>"Why, I&mdash;" began Merrill. He saw that the stick was an expensive one.
  "I don't know that I ought to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You mean because I haven't gone straight," cried Fisher, hurt.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said Merrill. "Thanks, Henry. I'll keep it. Thanks."</p>

  <p>"A present from Fisher," whined the other. "A gift to the only man he ever
  met that he couldn't swindle. For that's what you are, Bob: the shrewdest,
  wisest man I ever struck. Keep the stick&mdash;and good-by."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand. Merrill took it.</p>

  <p>"Good-by, Henry," he said. "If you ever decide to go straight&mdash;good
  luck."</p>

  <p>Fisher mumbled something and slipped out. With a look about to make sure
  that he had forgotten nothing, Merrill opened the door and followed. In his
  hand he carried the ebony walking stick; it was indeed a beautiful gift, and
  he looked down at it with pride. The gold elephant of the handle was very
  large, but not too large for a hand that had for ten years branded cattle in
  Texas.</p>

  <p>Merrill went on deck. Dusk had fallen, and the stars were twinkling above
  the unlovely old warehouses along the waterfront. Like an ungainly lover
  sidling up to the lady of his choice, the liner was making clumsy efforts to
  dock. On the pier where they were shortly to land a black mass of people
  waited.</p>

  <p>The ranchman stepped to the rail. Down below the waters were cluttered
  with small boats bearing venders of fruit and flowers. In one leaky craft a
  band of daring musicians twanged guitars and sang divinely "O-o-o
  solemia&mdash;" And there, faint in the dusk, were the villas, white and
  climbing; Vesuvius, with its eternal menace and its eternal romance, and over
  all the stars. Saturday night in Naples! Bob Merrill's heart beat fast.
  Truly, this was a land to come to in search of one's beloved.</p>

  <p>The liner docked, and a gangway was dropped at an angle of forty-five
  degrees to the pier. Before the passengers could go ashore their baggage
  trundled down into that now howling mob and off through many hands to the
  customs. Bob Merrill watched with misgivings as his trunk was carried through
  the crowd. His heart sank, for he knew he must follow and rescue it from
  excitable little men who did not speak his language. Landing in Italy began
  to have its serious side.</p>

  <p>Then he remembered the stick in his hand. A gift to a man who could not be
  swindled. Was he such a man, he wondered. He hoped so. He was still hoping
  when some one gave him a shove down that steep gangway, and the next thing he
  knew he was in Italy.</p>

  <p>First to greet him was Cook's man, his blessed English voice rising
  heavenly above the clutter of a strange tongue. Merrill was rescued from the
  loudly raving hotel runners, and soon landed with surprising ease in the
  lobby of the Hotel du Vesuve.</p>

  <p>That night he walked with the crowds on the Via Roma, amid the dandies,
  the cabbies with their eternally cracking whips, the laughing signorinas.
  Head and shoulders though he was above the little men of this country, they
  awed him with their babble. Meekly he submitted to their picturesque
  extortions. He felt lonely, lost, overwhelmed.</p>

  <p>And those delighted Neapolitans were quick to realize his state of mind.
  Dazed Americans had once been no novelty, but scarce they were in these war
  times, and the more to be cherished. Bob Merrill was a babe in their woods,
  and they made the most of him. Many hands were stretched out in impudent
  demand for his pennies, and as he filled them all he grasped his ebony stick
  the tighter, smiling grimly when he remembered what was given to him.</p>

  <p>The next afternoon a member of the band of forty thieves, disguised as a
  cabman, landed him at the station, and he left for Rome as per the promise he
  had made to Cook. He reached his destination at dusk, and the capital city
  was a revelation to him. The street of his hotel was as modern as Texas;
  crowds thronged it, gazing into the lighted shag windows, gathering at the
  doors of the moving-picture theatres. Street cars clanged down it. To one who
  had got his ideas of Rome from a picture of the Colosseum by moonlight, all
  this was startling. He was given a room looking out on the Via Nationale, and
  all night long the rattle of trolley cars broke in upon his sleep. Yet just
  behind his hotel the ruins of Nero's time lay white beneath the moon, and
  across the famous Tiber the great dome of St. Peter's stood guard.</p>

  <p>He awoke next morning from his disturbed slumbers a happy man. By evening
  he was to gaze again into the eyes that had so agitated his bosom in far-off
  Texas; he was to hear that voice which had been raised to such melodious
  effect in a dozen church choirs. Celia was lovely, she was feminine, she was
  his.</p>

  <p>He had just finished shaving when there came a knock at his door, and
  without ceremony a bellboy ushered a stranger into his room. He stepped Into
  the bedroom to find a small, swarthy Italian. with fierce mustache and
  shifting eye, waiting for him.</p>

  <p>"Hello," said Merrill. "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"My most profound apology," said the stranger, "that I must thus disturb
  you. But it is of the greatest importance. I am in the service of the
  Government. You wish my credentials?"</p>

  <p>He handed over stamped and sealed documents, and Bob Merrill stared
  helplessly at the unfamiliar script.</p>

  <p>"Can't make 'em out," said the ranchman as he gave back the impressive
  bundle. "But I suppose you came to look at my papers. Go as far as you like."
  And he produced his passport.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes." The Italian read. "This tells you are an American, signor."</p>

  <p>"You bet I am," Merrill answered. "One of the few left. I guess that's
  all, eh?"</p>

  <p>The Italian shrugged his shoulders and walked slowly about the room,
  glancing at Merrill's possessions. Suddenly he wheeled, dramatically.</p>

  <p>"If you are an American, signor," he cried, "how comes it that you serve
  Italy's enemies as a spy?" Bob Merrill had heard it was the common fate of
  travelers to be suspected, and he smiled pleasantly. But his heart sank. In
  this odd land of strangers he felt more than ever lost and alone could he
  make himself understood?</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, Tony," he said genially. "Somebody has been handing you a fake
  tip."</p>

  <p>"Somebody has made it known," the man answered, "that you carry papers of
  the utmost importance. I must search, signor."</p>

  <p>"Search and be damned," the ranchman laughed. "I suppose it's your regular
  business. But make it quick, for I've got a date with a breakfast
  downstairs."</p>

  <p>He stood at the window while the little man stooped over his trunk,
  hastily overturning the contents. At home, among his own kind, he would have
  taken the stranger by the scruff of the neck and deposited him elsewhere. But
  when in Rome&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Nothing to it, Tony," he smiled. "You're wasting time. There's my valise.
  See&mdash;innocent as a babe&mdash;that's me."</p>

  <p>The Italian had paused. His eyes were on a corner of the room, where stood
  the ebony stick. He stepped over and took the gold elephant of the handle in
  both his hands. It came off, and from a hollow in the wood the emissary of
  the Government removed a thin roll of paper and held it up before Merrill's
  startled eyes.</p>

  <p>"So, you carry nothing, eh?" The Italian spread the papers out on a table.
  Merrill saw that the topmost sheet was covered with crosses, waving lines,
  writing. "What is this? A map of the Champagne district in France: of
  trenches, of the distribution of forces. Information for Austria, a country
  with which Italy has been at war a month and over. Signor, you are under
  arrest!"</p>

  <p>Merrill passed his hand before his dazed eyes.</p>

  <p>"Look here, he said, "I don't know anything about this. That stick was
  given to me: a present from a friend."</p>

  <p>"Signor, the weakest of stories is that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But it's the truth."</p>

  <p>"You will have the opportunity to explain later. But I advise that you
  find some story more plausible. It matters little, however. You are captured
  completely. Prison, signor, and&mdash;perhaps&mdash;the firing squad."</p>

  <p>"Prison nothing. It would take a hundred like you to put me there."</p>

  <p>"Then the hundred shall be found."</p>

  <p>"I'm leaving for Florence this afternoon. I've an appointment there: with
  a lady." Merrill faced him helplessly.</p>

  <p>"Let us hope the lady is not too charming," sneered the other. "It will be
  many weeks before you see her&mdash;if ever. Do not keep me waiting,
  signor."</p>

  <p>Merrill strode to the window. So Fisher was a spy now and had made use of
  him. It was plain enough. Somewhere along the line a confederate was to have
  relieved him of the stick. He looked out on that foreign scene that had made
  him so childishly helpless even before he was in trouble. He would be taken
  where few spoke his language, and his explanation was weak in any tongue. It
  was incredible. It sounded poor even to his own ears. Prison would surely
  follow. He recalled a line in a play he had seen: "Italian prisons are
  devilishly uncomfortable." Meanwhile Celia would wait, frightened,
  woeful.</p>

  <p>"Come, signor," urged the little man.</p>

  <p>Suddenly into Merrill's mind flashed a statement made to him several times
  by Fisher in the course of his tales of graft. It was to the effect that no
  Italian official was above a bribe, rightly offered. He turned and looked the
  Italian in the eye.</p>

  <p>"See here," he said, "you've saved your country's honor. That's enough,
  ain't it? What will you get by dragging me off to jail? Nothing. If you could
  see your way clear to letting this matter drop I might make you a very
  handsome present."</p>

  <p>The man drew himself up to his full height, which was little.</p>

  <p>"You insult," he said, "me, my position, my Government. It is unworthy of
  you. Come, signor."</p>

  <p>"Five hundred dollars," said Merrill.</p>

  <p>"No; I'll put it in your money: it sounds more. Two thousand five hundred
  lire&mdash;a neat little sum. Go out of here and forget what you've found and
  it's yours."</p>

  <p>The man smiled.</p>

  <p>"My price it is cheap, in your eyes," he said. "No, signor&mdash;many
  times no." He came closer. "Ten thousand lire," he added softly. "Not a
  centesimi less."</p>

  <p>"Two thousand dollars," Merrill answered. "You've got your nerve. Take me
  to jail." He put on his hat. "I suppose I can communicate with the embassy."
  he said.</p>

  <p>"If you like," agreed the Italian. "Three other men of your nation, caught
  as you are caught, have communicated. It does little good. There are
  negotiations&mdash;what you call red tape&mdash;a long time is taken.
  Meanwhile you wait in prison."</p>

  <p>Merrill paused. He cursed Henry Howard Fisher under his breath. He thought
  of Celia&mdash;of her happy, eager letter that had been waiting for him at
  Naples.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said. "Come over to the bank with me and I'll cash in on
  my letter of credit. I'd like to fight this, but I can't afford to be held up
  now."</p>

  <p>They went out into the sunlight, the Italian carrying the ebony stick. At
  the Banca d'Italia Merrill showed his passport and canceled his letter,
  receiving in return ten Italian notes, each good for a thousand lire, along
  with a little small currency that represented the difference in exchange. Had
  there been an American behind the bars of that bank the deal might have
  fallen through. But here, too, everything was foreign, strange. They returned
  to the street.</p>

  <p>"Here, you merry little grafter," said Merrill, "take your money, quick,
  before I brain you. You caught me with the goods, and no mistake. How about
  that roll of plans?"</p>

  <p>"See," said his companion. "To Italy I am true. The plans, I destroy
  them."</p>

  <p>And, standing there on the street comer, he tore into shreds the papers
  Merrill had been carrying in the ebony stick.</p>

  <p>"You might give me the cane," suggested Merrill. "I'd sort of like to keep
  it, as a souvenir."</p>

  <p>"A thousand pardons," the Italian answered. "It is not good you should
  carry it. A stick of this style: it is better in my hands than in those
  of&mdash;a spy."</p>

  <p>And he walked away down the street, gayly twirling the stick in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>Merrill stood looking after him, chagrined that he had been so easy, yet
  knowing in his heart that he had done the only wise thing. To be dragged into
  court as a spy, particularly when the evidence was so hopelessly against him,
  would have been unthinkable at this time. Money came quickly at the ranch,
  and Celia's company weighed against ten thousand lire easily tipped the
  scales. He hoped, however, that he could keep the matter from the boys at the
  Silver Star.</p>

  <p>He set out for his hotel. If he had felt helpless in this foreign land
  before, he felt vastly more so now that his pockets were empty and his credit
  gone. He searched for funds, and found only his tickets and a few lire that
  would hardly last the day out. Back at the hotel he sent his cable to Dick
  asking for another thousand. Fortunately he was able to charge it, though
  this was not included in the scheme of Cook. And he knew that now he could
  not leave Rome until his money came. The hotel porter explained to him that
  owing to the difference in time the cable would probably reach Texas at an
  even earlier hour than that at which it was sent, and predicted that the
  answer would come back by evening at the latest. Merrill cheered greatly to
  hear this. But we have seen how that cablegram was swept into the discard on
  the desk of Major Tellfair. The hour came when the ranchman was due by his
  promise to Cook to start for Florence, and there had been no word from Texas.
  He was compelled to send Celia a telegram stating that he was delayed. All
  the next day and the next he waited, fuming, wondering. Cook's arrangement
  served him no longer, and his bill at the hotel was mounting. He sent Celia
  frequent telegrams, charging them on that bill. He was a worried man.</p>

  <p>But, fortunately for the ranchman, Clay Garrett was moved on the morning
  of the third day to sing "Silver threads among the gold," and thus wake the
  major to his forgotten duty. At three in the afternoon the money reached
  Rome, and Bob Merrill, much relieved, paid his bill at the hotel and took the
  four o'clock train for Florence.</p>

  <p>On that ride to the lovely city of his happiness he was crowded into a
  second-class compartment along with five army officers and what appeared to
  be an Italian honeymoon. The afternoon was warm, the quarters cramped, and
  the scenery along the way not what he had been led to expect of Italy. But at
  the end of that journey waited Celia, and he was content to sit and dream,
  while the soft language of the country, being squandered on all sides of him,
  lulled his senses. In the corridor outside the compartment walked many
  Romeos, stopping now and then at the door, after the Italian custom, to stare
  impudently at the lady who was within.</p>

  <p>For three hours Merrill sat in his cramped corner, and then he decided to
  become one of the walkers in the corridor. He strolled up and down several
  times, stretching his legs. His path led him past several first-class
  compartments at the farther end of the car. One of these had its door closed,
  its curtains drawn. Pausing reflectively outside, Merrill caught a glimpse
  beneath a curtain not quite down of two gray and natty spats. They seemed
  somehow familiar. Going the Italians one better, he deliberately stooped and
  looked into the compartment. Lolling at his ease in a corner, the sole
  occupant, he beheld Mr. Henry Howard Fisher!</p>

  <p>Smiling with joy over his discovery, Merrill thrust open the door and came
  abruptly into the presence of his erstwhile friend. At sight of the ranchman
  Fisher's eyes narrowed, but he leaped to his feet in cordial greeting.</p>

  <p>"By Gad," he cried, "if it isn't Bob Merrill. I thought you had left for
  Florence several days ago. Your tickets from Cook&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I had an accident," said Merrill.</p>

  <p>"So sorry. What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Those little plans you gave me, Henry, along with the ebony stick. Of
  course you haven't heard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Plans&mdash;what plans? Sit down, Bob." Fisher thrust Merrill down upon
  the seat opposite. "Hot in here, isn't it?" He took off the light-gray duster
  he was wearing to protect his faultless attire from the stains of travel.
  "Don't you notice it&mdash;devilish hot? What was the accident, Bob?" And he
  carelessly threw the duster on the baggage rack above his head. His aim was
  good but luck was against him. For Bob Merrill's eyes, following the duster,
  saw that from one end of it there still protruded a large gold elephant, the
  head of a handsome ebony stick!</p>

  <p>For some seconds, with Fisher's frightened gaze upon him, Bob Merrill sat
  staring at the stick. And now at last into his simple, unsuspecting mind
  there flashed the truth regarding the game that had been played on him. Hot
  anger swept into his heart. Fisher, watching, one eye on the door, saw and
  shuddered.</p>

  <p>"W&mdash;well?" stammered Fisher at last.</p>

  <p>"Well?" repeated Merrill sharply. He turned his eyes from the stick.
  "Well, Henry, you're shivering again. Like you were on the boat that last
  day. All sort of gone inside, eh? Afraid&mdash;God, you're afraid."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" Fisher demanded.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," replied Merrill. "I'm a slow thinker, Henry. Be patient
  with me. Give me time. Blamed if your teeth ain't chattering. Buck up, be a
  man. You make me sick to look at you. The police haven't got you yet."</p>

  <p>"You can't prove anything," Fisher cried. "Not a thing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know it," Merrill answered. "Come, Henry, try and be a man." The anger
  was gone already; the smile returned. "You ought to know I'm not the sort to
  run sniveling to the police. I'm just as afraid of the jabbering bunch as you
  are. I couldn't explain it to them in a thousand years. If you'll think hack,
  Henry. You'll recall I paid high in Rome to keep away from them, innocent
  though I was. No, Henry: it won't be the police."</p>

  <p>With visible relief, Fisher sank back into his corner. But his expression
  changed when Merrill added, looking at him critically:</p>

  <p><a id="pic1"
     name="pic1"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1301911h-images/TheEbonyStick1.png"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Not the police, but&mdash;you and me are alone here, Henry. I could break
  you in two with one hand, and throw the pieces out that window. That's what I
  ought to do, I guess. But I'm a tender-hearted man&mdash;on my way to be
  married. And it was a clever game, Henry, a clever game."</p>

  <p>Fisher smiled wanly.</p>

  <p>"Glad you appreciate it," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"I'm no cry-baby," said Merrill. "You got my roll. That's about the end of
  it. I ain't sure I didn't have it coming to me, I was so all-fired stuck up
  over what you said about me as a judge of men. And the stick, you gave it to
  the one man you couldn't swindle. By Gad, Henry, you sure are full of
  humor"</p>

  <p>"It enlivens my work&mdash;humor," admitted Fisher.</p>

  <p>"Tell me all about it," demanded Merrill. "I ought to know: I paid high.
  That roll of plans, now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did you examine them?" asked Fisher. "Artistic work, if I do say it
  myself. Sat up in my cabin the last five nights working on them: the
  Champagne district as I think it ought to be."</p>

  <p>"And the gent with the credentials who called on me in Rome? Come, Henry,
  tell me all about it. Remember how you used to tell me all your pranks? Who
  was he? What did you pay him?"</p>

  <p>"An ex-guide," said Fisher. "These are dull days for guides. He did it for
  a hundred. He would have stuck a knife in you for less."</p>

  <p>"A hundred lire," mused Merrill. "Good profits, Henry. Better than the
  cattle game. I wonder now, Henry, if you've got ten thousand lire about your
  lying, sneaking person&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stood over Fisher threateningly, but his late friend looked up at him
  without a trace of worry in his face.</p>

  <p>"Look me over," he said. "I told you many times&mdash;it isn't my method
  to carry loot about on me. I've only got a little change. Those ten thousand
  are banked, old boy: banked where you'll never get them." He held up his
  arms. "Search me," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"No use." Merrill shook his head. "Besides, I'm no pickpocket. Henry, it
  begins to look as though I'll just have to take my medicine and shut up.
  After all, I've got something out of the deal. I'll look out for the next man
  that batters me. What a convincing liar you are, my boy!"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," replied Fisher. "Really, I am. An artist looks at a sunset,
  and he just has to paint it. I looked at you, and you called out to the
  artist in me. I had to do you."</p>

  <p>"And you was just plain lying," mused Merrill. "All that about my being a
  great judge of men, and nobody could swindle me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, it looks that way, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"A lesson for me, Henry. I'll never get puffed up again. And&mdash;" he
  glanced toward the gold elephant above him&mdash;"there is a little something
  you can do for me, after all. You can make me a present all over again. You
  can give me that ebony stick to carry&mdash;so that I'll always be reminded
  I'm the easiest fool in shoe leather. You'll do that, Henry?"</p>

  <p>Fisher's jaws set.</p>

  <p>"I will not," he said. "That stick is mine. I need it." The ranchman came
  closer. "It's mine&mdash;let it alone,"</p>

  <p>"My boy," said Merrill softly, "don't act up. I want that stick: I want it
  for a souvenir&mdash;a reminder&mdash;to keep me humble like I should
  be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let it alone!" Fisher screamed. He started to rise from his seat, when
  suddenly the huge fingers of the ranchman's left hand engulfed his throat. He
  did not speak again, but the shifty eyes that looked up at Merrill filled
  suddenly with a deep respect.</p>

  <p>"Boy," said Merrill, "I could break you in two. Don't rile me. It ain't
  much I ask, just the ebony stick&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right," gurgled Fisher, and Merrill let go. "I'm full of that humor
  you spoke of. Poetic justice. I suppose it is." His face was bitter as he
  reached up and secured the stick. "Take it&mdash;from your old friend
  Fisher." He sneered, with a low bow.</p>

  <p>"To the easiest mark you ever met," smiled Merrill. "No!" snarled Fisher.
  "No! The old presentation speech still stands."</p>

  <p>Merrill paused a second, thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I'll be going back to my second-class corner," he said. "The high grade
  company in this red plush compartment ain't to my liking."</p>

  <p>He went out into the corridor, grasping his prize. Fisher followed him to
  the door. "Damn you!" he cried. "Why didn't you stick to that Cook's
  schedule? I banked on it. I said nothing on God's green earth could switch
  you."</p>

  <p>"From now on," Merrill answered, "nothing will. You've got my route, l
  guess, Don't get in my way again. Good-by."</p>

  <p>In the corridor outside his own compartment he sought to spring the catch
  that should open the head of the stick but, ignorant of the secret, his
  efforts were in vain. In another moment he was surrounded by a restless crowd
  bearing luggage, and an officer of whom he had made inquiries earlier in the
  journey tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Firenze," said the Italian.</p>

  <p>"By golly, he means Florence." Merrill cried, and his thoughts were no
  longer of walking sticks as he dove in to get his baggage.</p>

  <p>Florence proved to be the most lovely of all cities, for Celia Ware was
  waiting on the platform. A trifle more mature, a trifle wiser in the world's
  ways than when she left Texas to win fame and fortune, she seemed standing
  there; but still the Celia of the joyous eyes, the heart-warming smile. Bob
  Merrill overturned citizens to reach her side.</p>

  <p>"Celia," he cried. "Let me hear you say it. You want me more than
  music&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She clutched his arm.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bob," she answered. "You mean more than Beethoven to me."</p>

  <p>The glory of this renunciation caught Merrill in the throat, and without
  more preamble he took her in his arms and kissed her. The Italians are an
  emotional people, and the scene was not unappreciated.</p>

  <p>They were married next day in the English Church of the Holy Trinity, and
  in the crowded, gorgeous time that followed Merrill thought little of the
  ebony stick, save once when he humbly related his adventure to his wife.
  Italy decked itself in the glad habiliments of summer for their honeymoon;
  the sea was glittering glass when they sailed over it for home. The last week
  in July brought them, happy, once more to the Silver Star.</p>

  <p>On a certain very hot morning early in August Clay Garrett opened the door
  of that Texas bank as the clock on the City Hall struck nine. Two minutes
  later, according to his custom, Major Tellfair entered, nodded to Clay and
  the boys, and passed on into his office. Another five minutes elapsed, and
  Bob Merrill, with the family smile on his face, strode into that marble
  interior, an ebony stick in his hand.</p>

  <p>Major Tellfair rose quickly in welcome as Merrill entered the president's
  office. Certain formalities about the day and the Silver Star being disposed
  of, Merrill held up his walking stick. "Major," he said? "I told you the
  story of how I came by this cane. I reckon you remember&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course I do," said the major."</p>

  <p>And I'm eternally sorry that I left you waiting over there in
  Rome&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Best thing you ever did," Merrill interrupted. "I reckon I forgot to
  mention that when that low-down rascal gave me this stick the second time, as
  per my warm request, he said: 'The old presentation speech still stands.' I
  didn't gather what he meant at the time, but do now. Major, sir&mdash;there's
  been a sequel&mdash;and a dog-goned nice sequel, too."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, sir, I am very glad to hear it."</p>

  <p>"You know, l was so all-fired taken with the joys of matrimony I didn't
  pay any attention to this stick coming home. But last night out at the ranch
  got to fooling with it, and the handle came off." Merrill reached into his
  pocket, and threw down a small bundle of thin paper before his friend.
  "Major, as my banker, what am I going to do with that truck?"</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;um&mdash;" Major Tellfair studied the roll. "These seem to be
  banknotes issued in Italy, each for a thousand lire&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Correct," laughed Merrill. "And there's ten of them&mdash;ten nice new
  notes for a thousand lire each&mdash;the identical ten I handed over to a
  greasy little Dago in the Bank Ditallyuh, or whatever you call it. That slick
  Fisher told me they was banked where I'd never get them, but he was
  wrong&mdash;dead wrong."</p>

  <p>He leaned buck in his chair and laughed again.</p>

  <p>"Major, I'm a happy man. I'm married to the finest girl in Texas&mdash;and
  that means the world. And I went up against the slickest con man on the Seven
  Seas, and l did him. Yes, sir; l did him out of the hundred lire he paid that
  guy to get me."</p>

  <p>"I'm delighted," beamed the major. "That was a lucky meeting of yours:
  that second one with Fisher. It begins to look like my boy Clay burst into
  song at just the right date and locality."</p>

  <p>"That's true," agreed Merrill. "I'd almost forgotten that. Yes,
  sir&mdash;Clay surely launched into 'Silver Threads Among the Gold' at what
  they call the psychological moment. By the way, how about this stuff?"</p>

  <p>"I'll send it to New York to-day," the major promised, "and have it
  translated into real money for you. I won't forget, Bob."</p>

  <p>Merrill rose. "Thanks," he said. "Just put it to my account, major. I'm a
  happy man. But I mustn't get stuck on myself: that was the way I got done
  before."</p>

  <p>He returned to the banking room; Clay Garrett was loafing amiably near the
  door. Merrill removed a roll of bills from his pocket, took a twenty-dollar
  note from the top, and pressed it into the negro's hand.</p>

  <p>"That's yours, Clay." he said.</p>

  <p>Clay staggered weakly. "Fo' de Lawd's sake, Mistuh Bob, what's this?"</p>

  <p>"Just a few lire for you, Clay&mdash;that's all," Merrill answered.</p>

  <p>"Liar?" What yo-all mean&mdash;liar? Mistuh Bob, I swear I
  ain't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No offense," laughed Merrill. "I just want you to have it, Clay. I like
  your singing."</p>

  <p>He went out into the street, leaving a dazed but happy negro leaning
  unsteadily against a marble post.</p>
