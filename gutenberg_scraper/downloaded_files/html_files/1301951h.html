  <p class="first">I TELL you, Evans," said Dr. Dorp, banging his fist on the
  arm of his chair for emphasis, "the science of psychology is in much the same
  stage of development today as were the material sciences in the dark
  ages."</p>

  <p>"But surely," I objected, "the two centuries of investigation just past
  have yielded some fruit. It cannot be that the eminent men who have devoted
  the greater part of their lives' to this fascinating subject have labored in
  vain."</p>

  <p>The doctor stroked his iron-gray Van Dyke meditatively.</p>

  <p>"With a few&mdash;a very few exceptions, I'm afraid they have," he
  replied, "at least so far as their own deductions from observed phenomena are
  concerned."</p>

  <p>"Take Sir Oliver Lodge, for example&mdash;" I began. "The conclusions of
  Sir Oliver will serve as an excellent example for my analogy," said the
  doctor. "No doubt you are familiar with the results of his years of
  painstaking psychical research as expounded in his books."</p>

  <p>"I believe he has become a convert to spiritism," I replied.</p>

  <p>"With all due respect to Sir Oliver," said the doctor, "I should say that
  he has rather singled out such facts as suited his purpose and assembled them
  as evidence to support the spiritistic theory. It may seem paradoxical to add
  that I believe he has always been thoroughly conscientious in his
  investigation and sincere in his deductions."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I do not quite follow you."</p>

  <p>"There are times in the life of every man," continued the doctor, "when
  emotion dethrones reason. At such crisis the most keen-witted of scientists
  may be blinded to truth by the overpowering influence of his own desires. Sir
  Oliver lost a beloved son. Only those who have suffered similar losses can
  appreciate the keen anguish that followed his bereavement, or sympathize with
  his intense longing , to communicate with Raymond. Most men are creatures of
  their desires.</p>

  <p>They believe what they want to believe. Under the circumstance it was not
  difficult for a clever psychic to read the mind of the scientist and tell him
  the things he wanted to hear."</p>

  <p>"But what of the many investigators who have not been similarly
  influenced?" I inquired. "Surely they must have found some basis&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I was interrupted by the entrance of the doctor's housekeeper who
  announced- -</p>

  <p>"Beggin' your pardon, sir, a gentleman to see you, sir."</p>

  <p>"Show him in," Dr. Dorp said rather petulantly. His frown of annoyance
  changed to a welcoming smile of recognition at sight of the tall, bulky
  individual who strode through the doorway.</p>

  <p>"How are you, Doc," roared the big man as they shook hands cordially.
  "Haven't bothered you for a long time, have I? Got a case for you now that
  will make you put on your thinking cap all right."</p>

  <p>"Sounds interesting," replied the doctor. "Let me present an old friend of
  mine, Mr. Evans, who writes a story every now and then when the spirit moves
  him. Mr. Evans, Chief McGraw of the detective bureau. We were just discussing
  our mutual hobby, psychic phenomena, when you came in," he continued after we
  had acknowledged the introduction.</p>

  <p>"No doubt Chief McGraw's communication is of a confidential nature&mdash;"
  I began, with the purpose of taking leave of my host.</p>

  <p>"Nothing secret about it so far as Dr. Dorp and his friends are
  concerned," interrupted the chief. "It may be that if you are a psychologist
  you can offer some solution of the mystery. Of course, I don't exactly know
  whether it's a case for a psychologist or not. Damned curious thing, and
  ghastly too."</p>

  <p>"Stay and listen if you are interested," said the doctor.</p>

  <p>"If it has any smattering of psychology or the occult, you know my
  failing," I responded.</p>

  <p>"Can't say as to that," said the chief. "It's queer enough, though-and
  horrible. You gentlemen have heard of Professor Townsend, I presume."</p>

  <p>"You mean Albert Townsend, the chemist and inventor?" asked the doctor.
  "Assuredly. Who hasn't heard of him and his queer theories about creating
  life from inert matter? What has he done now?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether it's something he did or something that was done to
  him, but anyway he's dead."</p>

  <p>"Murdered?"</p>

  <p>"That's the point I want you to help me clear up. I don't know. His
  daughter 'phoned the office this morning and asked for me. When I got on the
  wire I could hardly understand her, she was so hysterical. Sobbed out
  something about her father being gone and a human skeleton lying on the floor
  of his laboratory. I jumped in the car and took Hirsch, the finger- print
  expert out there with me. We found the frightened girl weeping in the arms of
  a motherly neighbor, who informed us that the laboratory was on the second
  floor.</p>

  <p>"The whitened skeleton of Professor Townsend, fully clothed in garments
  that hung like rags on a scarecrow, lay on the floor of the laboratory,"</p>

  <p>"You made sure, of course, that it really was the skeleton of the
  Professor."</p>

  <p>"Beyond the least shadow of doubt. In the first place it was clothed in
  the professor's garments. His watch with his name in the back was ticking in
  the vest pocket. His monogrammed ring, a present from his daughter, circled a
  bony finger. On the bones of his right forearm were the marks of a fracture
  that had healed and the skull was slightly indented above the right temple.
  These marks resulted from an automobile accident in which the professor was
  injured two years ago. To make assurance doubly sure, we called in his
  dentist who readily identified his own work on the teeth."</p>

  <p>"When was the professor last seen alive?"</p>

  <p>"That is the feature that makes the affair so uncanny. He was alive, and
  apparently normal mentally and physically, at dinner last evening." "Most
  amazing!" exclaimed Dr. Dorp. "Suppose we go out&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just what I was going to suggest." replied the chief. "My car is waiting
  outside. Would you care to accompany us, Mr. Evans?"</p>

  <p>"He would perish from curiosity if he couldn't see the thing through now,"
  said the doctor when I hesitated. "Come along with us, old man. If two minds
  are better than one, then surely three minds are superior to two."</p>

  <p>We piled into the chief's roomy roadster and were soon speeding toward the
  house of mystery.</p><br>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">Two Mysterious Deaths</p><br>

  <p class="first">PRESENTLY the car stopped before a two-story brick house.
  Its upper windows, with shades half drawn, appeared to stare down at us with
  a look of sly cunning as if endeavoring to conceal some fearful secret.</p>

  <p>A short chunky individual, smooth-faced and with a decidedly florid
  complexion, met us at the door. Chief McGraw introduced him as Hirsch, the
  fingerprint expert.</p>

  <p>"All alone, Hirsch?" asked the chief, looking about as we entered the
  spacious living room.</p>

  <p>"Might as well be," replied Hirsch. "Miss Townsend is in her room with a
  neighbor. The cook and housemaid are out in the kitchen, scared green."
  "Coroner been here?"</p>

  <p>"No. He called me up about twenty minutes ago and said he had an inquest
  to attend to on the south side. Told me he didn't know how soon he could get
  here, but it would be several hours, at least." "How about the prints?"</p>

  <p>"All the finger prints in the laboratory seem to have been made by the
  same person, evidently the professor."</p>

  <p>"Hum. Better 'phone headquarters right away and have them send Rooney out.
  He might come in handy to guard the death room in case the coroner is
  late."</p>

  <p>"All right sir. I'll call up right away."</p>

  <p>"Now gentlemen," said the chief, turning to the doctor and me, "let us go
  upstairs."</p>

  <p>We followed him up the thickly carpeted stairway and along A broad
  corridor at the end of which he opened a door.</p>

  <p>I started involuntarily at sight of the grinning, ghastly thing that lay
  on the floor. Not so Dr. Dorp. He knelt beside it and examined it minutely,
  his keen gray eyes alert for every detail. He even touched his fingers to the
  white forehead and prodded the shadowy depths of the empty eye sockets.</p>

  <p>At length he rose and washed his hands at the porcelain lavatory.</p>

  <p>"It seems incredible," he said, "that this man could have been alive
  yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Just what I was thinking," responded the chief. "Those bones could not
  have been drier or whiter if they had bleached in the sunlight for the last
  ten years."</p>

  <p>The doctor now turned his attention to the contents of the laboratory. He
  examined the collection of retorts, test tubes, breakers, jars, dishes and
  other paraphernalia spread on a porcelain-topped table set against the wall
  and reaching half the length of the room. The walls were shelved clear to the
  ceiling, and every shelf was crowded to its utmost capacity with bottles,
  jars and cans containing a multitude of chemicals. To these he gave but scant
  attention.</p>

  <p>In the center of the immaculate white tile floor stood an open,
  glass-lined vat. From its height and diameter I estimated its capacity at
  about sixty gallons. This vat was more than a third full of a colorless,
  viscous liquid that gave off a queer, musty odor.</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose that stuff is?" I asked Dr. Dorp.</p>

  <p>"Looks like a heavy albuminous or gelatinous solution," he said. "Possibly
  it is some special compound the professor employed in his experiments.
  Mediums of this nature are often used in the cultivation of colonies of
  bacteria and it is possible that he intended to use it as a carrier and food
  for the organisms it was his ambition to create synthetically."</p>

  <p>"Any idea what caused the death of the professor?" asked the chief.</p>

  <p>"I have a theory," replied Dr. Dorp, "but it seems so illogical, so wildly
  impossible, so&mdash;er, contrary to the teachings of science that I prefer
  to keep it to myself for the present, at least."</p>

  <p>A heavy tread sounded in the hallway and a moment later a blue-uniformed
  officer entered.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Rooney," greeted Chief McGraw. "I want you to see that no one
  disturbs this room or its contents until the coroner arrives. We are going
  downstairs now. Keep a weather eye on things and I'll send a man to relieve
  you soon. If either of these gentlemen wants to come in at any time you may
  admit him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. I'll remember them."</p>

  <p>We trooped down stairs. Two women were seated in the living room. Chief
  McGraw presented us to the younger, who proved to be the professor's
  daughter, Dorothy Townsend. She was a slender girl about twenty years of age
  with pale, regular features and a wealth of gold-brown hair. Her large,
  expressive eyes were red with recent weeping and her lips quivered slightly
  as she bowed to us in turn and introduced us to the stout, middle-aged
  neighbor, Mrs. Harms, who had been endeavoring to comfort her.</p>

  <p>"Hirsch and I are going to run down to headquarters for a couple of
  hours," said the chief. "Would you prefer to come with us or stay here and
  look around?"</p>

  <p>"I think we had better look around a bit if you don't mind," replied: the
  doctor.</p>

  <p>"All right. I'm going to send a man to relieve Rooney at six. Will be
  along myself a little later. If you discover anything new call me up."</p>

  <p>When the two men were gone the doctor bowed before Miss Townsend.</p>

  <p>"May I have a few words with you in private?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," she replied, rising, "in Father's study if you wish."</p>

  <p>They entered the study, which was directly off the living room, and closed
  the door. They must have been gone about a half hour, but it seemed like two
  hours to me as, fidgeting inwardly, I listened to Mrs. Harms' family history,
  her account of the death of her beloved husband, and minute descriptions of
  six operations she had undergone, each time, to use her own expression,
  "standing at the entrance of death's door." She assured me, also, that she
  knew what it was to have death in the. home. The Grim Reaper had visited her
  family a score of times, she averred, and only three weeks before, one of her
  roomers had been found dead in bed.</p>

  <p>She prattled on with scarce a pause until the door of the study opened. I
  was glad when she went upstairs with Miss Townsend and left Dr. Dorp and me
  together.</p>

  <p>"Come into the study," he said. "I have learned some interesting things,
  and it is possible that more awaits us in here."</p>

  <p>Professor Townsend's study was neither large nor pretentious. It was
  obviously the retreat of a profound student as attested by the book-lined
  walls, many of the volumes of which were worn with much handling. The
  furniture consisted of a large, roll-top desk, a smaller typewriter desk on
  which stood a hooded machine, a filing cabinet, two office chairs and three
  comfortable overstuffed chairs, one beside the window, the other two placed
  conveniently under wall lights for reading.</p>

  <p>A thick pile of typewritten manuscripts lay on the roll-top desk. The
  doctor divided them, handing me half and settling himself comfortably in one
  of the overstuffed chairs with the other half.</p>

  <p>"Miss Townsend kindly brought these out of the files for me," explained
  the doctor. "I think it possible that they may shed some light on the
  mysterious cause of the death of their author. We can save time dividing the
  work."</p>

  <p>"I believe I can conduct a more intelligent search if-you will give me
  some idea of what I am to look for," I said.</p>

  <p>"Quite so," he agreed. "I had forgotten for the moment that you were not
  familiar with the details of my interview with Miss Townsend. Let me review
  it briefly.</p>

  <p>"She finished school nearly a year ago, and since that time has been
  acting as her father's secretary, typing his manuscripts and attending to
  much of his voluminous correspondence.</p>

  <p>"He had been working day and night in his effort to prove his theory that
  a living organism can be created from inorganic matter. During their months
  of close association she found him extremely irritable until one morning
  about three weeks ago. It appeared that his very nature had changed over
  night and she assumed that he had made some important discovery. She
  remembers the exact date owing to the fact that Mrs. Harms' roomer was found
  dead in bed on the night of the supposed discovery. This roomer, who was
  living under an alias, was found to be a notorious character known as Immune
  Benny, and is alleged to have committed numerous crimes, among which were
  several revolting murders, without ever having been convicted.</p>

  <p>"After that night the professor's jubilant attitude kept up until death.
  He paid no attention to his correspondence or manuscripts and spent the
  greater part of his time in his laboratory, presumably experimenting with
  numerous live animals which he had delivered each day. His first experiments,
  she stated, were with mice, rats and guinea pigs. He next used cats, rabbits
  and small dogs, then larger dogs until, on the day before his death he had
  two huge mastiffs brought to the house and took them into the laboratory.
  None of the animals taken behind the door ever reappeared, and she quite
  naturally assumed that they had been the subjects of vivisection. My theory,
  is that he&mdash;" The doctor was interrupted by a loud rap at the study
  door. He rose and opened it, revealing a sturdy' uniformed policeman. A
  frightened housemaid peered around his huge bulk. The man seemed greatly
  perturbed. His voice shook as he asked&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Where's Rooney?"</p>

  <p>"He's on guard in the laboratory," replied the doctor. "Are you the man
  sent to relieve him?" "I'm Officer Burke. The maid, here, showed me to the
  laboratory, but Rooney ain't there. It's a horrible place. Don't blame him
  for leavin'."</p>

  <p>"Yes. That skeleton on the floor isn't exactly pretty."</p>

  <p>"That skeleton? You mean them skeletons* There was two of them, and one
  was dressed in a cop's uniform!"</p>

  <p>With an exclamation of surprise and horror, the doctor threw down the
  manuscripts he was holding and rushed for the stairway. I followed
  breathlessly.</p><br>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">A Strange Diary</p><br>

  <p class="first">WHAT we saw in that awful room of death confirmed our
  wildest fears. A skeleton, with the bones whitened like those of the
  professor, lay on the floor facing the doorway. One bony arm was stretched
  across the threshold as if its owner had been attempting to drag himself from
  the room when struck down. A blue uniform bagged loosely over the bones, and
  on the feet were the heavy, hobnailed, square-toed shoes I' had noticed on
  Rooney's feet some time before.</p>

  <p>The doctor squinted at the star on the breast of the recumbent figure.
  Then he turned to Officer Burke who had come up behind us.</p>

  <p>"What was Rooney's number?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"942."</p>

  <p>"Then this is Rooney's uniform and it probably is his skeleton. 'Call up
  the chief and tell him what happened. This is horrible&mdash;diabolical!"</p>

  <p>"Your theory," I said, "does this shed any light on it?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," he replied, "It makes the case more baffling than ever.
  It seems incredible that such things can really happen. I tell you, Evans,
  there is some mysterious force at work here&mdash;something new and unheard
  of in the annals of scientific research. It is my opinion that the late
  Professor Townsend chanced upon some force hitherto unknown to scientists and
  played with it like a little child with fire until it suddenly destroyed him.
  The death of Officer Rooney is ample proof that this terrible force, whatever
  it may be, survived him.</p>

  <p>"Now let us conjecture regarding the nature of this thing that has taken
  the lives of two human beings. We know that the professor's chief ambition
  was to create life from inert matter. All of his experiments in the
  laboratory were made with this object in view. All his printed works show
  plainly his firm belief that the thing could be accomplished, some of them
  going so far as to point out the processes by which he believed protoplasm,
  the primitive basic life substance, might be analyzed. As protoplasm is a
  compound of almost unlimited complexity in its physical and chemical
  constitution, our most skilled chemists have been unable to unravel its
  secrets. In fact, the further a chemist gets in his attempts at analysis the
  more baffling and complex he finds it to be. Being a compound composed of
  complex substances which are in turn composed of others still more complex,
  and so on, ad infinitum, its secrets are fully as inscrutable as those of the
  starry universe.</p>

  <p>"The professor's first step, therefore, in this seemingly impossible
  undertaking, would be to analyze protoplasm. Assuming that he succeeded in
  reducing it to its basic elements his next problem would be to take similar
  elements and, through a process even more complex than the previous one,
  assemble and re-assemble them until they were capable of sustaining life.</p>

  <p>"Let us suppose that he did these things. Let us assume that he has
  succeeded in creating protoplasm. What next? We will say that he has taken
  some primitive form of life for a pattern, a moneron, perhaps, the most
  simple type of animal, consisting of a single cell of protoplasm. There still
  exists a difference between the moneron and the synthetically created cell.
  Chemically and physically they are the same, but the moneron is alive.</p>

  <p>"What is life? Broadly defined as we recognize it on this earth, it is a
  temporary union of mind and matter. There may be, and probably is another
  kind of life which is simply mind without matter, but we of the material
  world know it not. To us, mind without matter or matter without mind are
  equally dead. The moneron has a mind&mdash;a soul&mdash;a something that
  makes it a living individual. Call it what you will. The professor's cell of
  man-made protoplasm has not. Can you conceive of any possible way in which he
  could, having reached this stage, create an individual mind or soul, an
  essence of life that, once united with his cell of protoplasm would form an
  entity?"</p>

  <p>"It seems impossible," I admitted.</p>

  <p>"So it seems," he replied, "yet it is only on such an hypothesis that I
  can account for the mysterious deaths of the professor and Officer
  Rooney."</p>

  <p>"But I don't see how a moneron or a creature remotely resembling one could
  kill and completely devour a man in less than two hours," I objected.</p>

  <p>"Nor I," agreed the doctor. "In fact I am of the opinion that, if the
  professor did succeed in creating life, the result was unlike any creature
  large or small, now inhabiting the earth&mdash;a hideous monster, perhaps,
  with undreamed of powers and possibilities&mdash;an alien organism among
  billions of other organisms, hating them all because it has nothing in common
  with them&mdash;a malignant entity governed solely by the primitive desire
  for food and growth with only hatred of and envy for the more fortunate
  natural creatures around it."</p>

  <p>"If the professor did succeed in creating or discovering such a creature,"
  I said, "it is evidently in this house at this very moment. Unless it has the
  faculty of making itself invisible a thorough search should reveal its
  whereabouts, for having consumed two men it must be a monster of no mean
  proportions."</p>

  <p>"That is true," replied the doctor, "however, we have another hypothesis
  that is equally worthy of our consideration if we accept the premise that the
  professor created a living creature. Judging from his writings he spent a
  considerable portion of his time studying and experimenting in microbiology.
  Suppose he succeeded in creating a microscopic organism, and that organism
  had the power to reproduce its kind. If it reproduced by fission, that is, by
  simply dividing itself after it had attained a certain size, the only check
  to its increase would be death or lack of food. The more food it could obtain
  that much more rapidly would it and its descendants multiply. Countless
  billions of such creatures might occupy this room and yet be invisible
  without the aid of a compound microscope. There is ample room for a swarm of
  such creatures numerous enough to devour a man to float in the air above our
  heads without revealing its presence." The words of the doctor affected me
  strangely. Involuntarily I looked upward, half expecting a swarm of
  man-eating microbes to descend and devour me. For a moment I was seized with
  a feeling of panic so strong I could scarcely restrain myself from leaping
  for the door. The fact that the sun had just set and dusky shadows were
  thickening in the room augmented the illusion. I crossed the floor nervously
  and pressed the switch beside the door. Instantly the place was flooded with
  blue-white light from a cluster of powerful globes depending from the middle
  of the ceiling.</p>

  <p>As I was recrossing the room my eyes fell on the contents of the
  glass-lined tank. I stared unbelievingly for a moment, then called Dr.
  Dorp.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Evans?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The liquid in this tank," I replied. "It has changed color. Something has
  turned it pink." "The effect of the artificial light, no doubt," he said,
  coming up beside me. Then I saw the expression of doubt on his face change to
  one of surprise and wonder.</p>

  <p>"You are right," he exclaimed. "It has not only changed color but a still
  more remarkable transformation has taken place. When we noticed it this
  afternoon, the tank was a third full of the colorless liquid. This pink fluid
  reaches half way to the top!"</p><br>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">A Drawer Filled With Bones</p><br>

  <p class="first">HE tread of many feet sounded in the hall.</p>

  <p>Chief McGraw paused in the doorway, staring down at the blue-clad skeleton
  on the floor, a look of horror on his face. Behind him were four policemen in
  uniform.</p>

  <p>"Is&mdash;is that the skeleton of poor old Rooney?"</p>

  <p>McGraw asked. It's too ghastly a thing to believe. "I'm afraid it is,"
  replied Dr. Dorp.</p>

  <p>The chief knelt and examined the star on the bagging blue coat.</p>

  <p>"It's hellish, positively hellish," he said, rising. "Do you know what
  killed him?"</p>

  <p>"We are working on a theory&mdash;" began the doctor, but was interrupted
  by the chief.</p>

  <p>"Theories be damned!" he snapped. "Work on your theories if you want to.
  This thing has gone too far. I'm going to get some facts'." He swung on the
  four men behind him. "Search the house," he said. "Look sharp for anything of
  a suspicious nature. An infernal machine, perhaps, or a blood sucking animal.
  There is a man-killer of some kind, human or otherwise, hidden in this house,
  and it's our business to find it."</p>

  <p>When the men. had departed he stepped over Rooney's skeleton.</p>

  <p>"I'll search this room myself," he said.</p>

  <p>He did, with professional thoroughness, looking for hidden panels and
  sounding the walls, both in the open areas and behind the shelves, for hollow
  spaces. Then he began opening the drawers in a tall cabinet that stood in one
  corner, disclosing surgical and dissecting instruments of various kinds, an
  indexed set of microscope slides with some extra lenses, platinum dishes;
  porcelain drying pans, crucibles, glass rods and tubing, pipettes, rubber
  tubing and stoppers, rubber gloves and aprons, and other miscellaneous
  laboratory paraphernalia.</p>

  <p>The bottom drawer of the cabinet was quite large and deep. The chief cried
  out excitedly when he saw its contents.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! Look at that!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>It was filled to the top with dry, white bones. "Nothing but the bones of
  small animals," said Dr. Dorp, picking up a skull. "This, for instance, is
  the skull of a dog." Then, taking up another: "Here is the skull of a rabbit.
  Notice the characteristic chisel-shaped teeth. This one beside it once
  supported the be-whiskered countenance of a common house cat."</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose he was doing with them?" asked the chief.</p>

  <p>"It is my belief that they were brought here to be killed and devoured by
  the same thing that killed the professor and Rooney."</p>

  <p>"And that thing is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"At present, merely a shadowy theory, although it most certainly has an
  existence. There is a power in this house that is a menace to everyone under
  this roof&mdash;a malignant entity that destroys human beings in some
  mysterious manner unparalleled in the annals of science or human experience.
  This much we know, reasoning from effects. Reasoning from possible causes we
  are aware that the hobby of Professor Townsend was the endeavor to create a
  living thing from inorganic matter, and putting the two together it seems to
  me that the logical hypothesis would be that he either succeeded in creating
  a monster of a sort unknown to biologists, or discovered and developed
  unheard of powers and habits in a creature already known." "If there's such a
  thing in this house, believe me I'm going to find it," said the chief,
  stamping out of the room.</p>

  <p>"Now that we have a few moments to ourselves," said Dr. Dorp when McGraw
  had departed, "let us conduct a search, or rather an inquiry on our own
  account. I perceive that we have a very excellent compound microscope at our
  disposal and am curious to examine the liquid which-has so mysteriously risen
  and changed color in the tank."</p>

  <p>He took a blank slide from the cabinet drawer and a small glass rod from
  the table. As he was about to dip the rod in the liquid he uttered a low
  exclamation of surprise.</p>

  <p>"What's up now?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"This amazing liquid has again become transparent," he replied. "The red
  tint is gone."</p>

  <p>He plunged the tip of the rod into the viscous liquid, twisted it slightly
  and withdrew it. Although the liquid seemed quite heavy it slipped from the
  end of the rod much after the manner of the white of an egg. After
  considerable juggling he succeeded in obtaining a small amount which he
  smeared on the slide. He then placed the slide in position and adjusted the
  microscope with a practiced hand.</p>

  <p>"Well," I asked, after he had peered into the eyepiece for a full ten
  minutes, "what is the stuff, anyway?".</p>

  <p>"Here, look for yourself," he replied.</p>

  <p>What I saw in the field of the microscope appeared to be a mesh work or
  foam work of exceedingly fine bubbles or perhaps globules. Granules of
  different sizes' and shapes seemed imbedded in these globules and the whole
  was dotted at intervals with small white objects. While I watched several of
  these white objects seemed to dissolve and disappear. All of them apparently
  were endowed with life for I noticed that they expanded or contracted
  spasmodically and seemed endeavoring to push their way through the
  surrounding bubbles.</p>

  <p>"Seems to be a sort of foam," I said, "with something alive floating in
  it."</p>

  <p>"The foam, as you call it, bears a singular resemblance to the basic life
  principle, protoplasm, when seen under the microscope," replied the
  doctor.</p>

  <p>"But those white things&mdash;" I began.</p>

  <p>"The white things," he went on, "are the living remnants of a complex
  organism that has been destroyed. They are waging an unequal and hopeless
  battle against assimilation by the globules that surround them. These
  faithful guardians of the organism when alive still fight, and will continue
  to fight the enemy until, figuratively speaking, the last man falls."</p>

  <p>"But what are they?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>"Unless I am very much mistaken," he replied, "they are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His answer was cut short by the appearance of Chief McGraw.</p>

  <p>"Coroner and jury are downstairs," he said tersely. "I suppose they'll
  want your testimony. I'll leave a couple of men on guard here if you want to
  come down."</p>

  <p>"Let us go down to the study and complete our perusal of the professor's
  manuscripts while the jury is in session," said the doctor. "We can thus save
  considerable time and will be on hand when they are ready to question
  us."</p>

  <p>We met Coroner Haynes and his jurors at the foot of the stairs. They were
  about to go up for an inspection of the laboratory and its gruesome
  contents.</p>

  <p>Dr. Dorp switched on one of the reading lamps and closed the door. Then he
  established himself in a comfortable chair with a pile of manuscripts and I
  followed his example. We found essays and articles on almost every subject
  pertaining to the transmission or generation of life. There were papers on
  anatomy, bacteriology, cell-structure, microbiology and embryology. There'
  were treatises on evolution, spontaneous generation, and the structures and
  habits of micro-organisms. A forceful and extremely impressive essay set
  forth the astounding theory that all life was merely a form of force
  generated from matter. The reasoning was, of course, purely analogical. The
  professor's Contention, stated briefly, was that just as electricity, a force
  that is invisible and indefinable, is generated by the friction of particles
  of certain kinds of matter, so life is generated and springs into being when
  certain other types of matter come together in the right proportions and
  combinations.</p>

  <p>"What is your opinion of this theory?" I asked Dr. Dorp.</p>

  <p>"It is most cleverly put, but false because based on the false premise of
  the materialists that there are but two things in the universe, matter and
  force. They do not recognize the power that controls the force which moves
  the matter toward a fixed objective. That' power is mind. Thus, to them, all
  life and all mind are merely forms of force generated originally from inert
  matter."</p>

  <p>"If the professor succeeded in creating a living thing from inert matter,"
  I said, "it seems to me that he has demonstrated his proposition."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because he was experimenting with dead matter and not with mind or living
  creatures. There would be no mind or soul involved to inherit its being from
  a parent mind or soul. A new life entity would be generated, as it were, from
  matter which formerly contained no life."</p>

  <p>"I think," said the doctor quietly, "you would have stated the proposition
  more accurately had you said that a life entity&mdash;a mind without a
  body&mdash;had been induced to enter the body synthetically created."</p>

  <p>Our discourse was interrupted by Chief McGraw, who informed us that we
  were wanted by the coroner.</p><br>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">The Coroner's Jury</p><br>

  <p class="first">DR. DORP did the talking before the coroner's jury. All the
  way through his testimony was negative. When asked if he had any idea what
  killed the professor and the policeman he replied that he had several ideas,
  but none of them would be worth bringing before the jury without more facts
  to substantiate them. I could see that his purpose was to get the inquest
  over with as soon as possible so we might continue the investigation.</p>

  <p>After due deliberation a verdict of "Death from cause or causes unknown,"
  was brought in and the coroner departed with his men.</p>

  <p>"Now that the inquest is over, what do you suggest?" McGraw asked the
  doctor.</p>

  <p>"My suggestion is that we immediately destroy the liquid in the
  glass-lined tank in the laboratory."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because I am convinced that it is at least one. of the causes of the
  deaths that have taken place in this house."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you have a good reason for your assumption."</p>

  <p>"An excellent one, I believe. While you and your men were searching the
  house, Mr. Evans and I conducted a little investigation of our own. We put
  some of the liquid under the compound microscope and as we both saw the same
  things I am convinced that my eyes did not deceive me. Tell the chief what
  you saw, Evans."</p>

  <p>I described the foam work, the granules and the white objects which
  appeared to be alive and struggling to escape.</p>

  <p>"All Greek to me," said the chief. "What was it?"</p>

  <p>"The foam work with its accompanying granules closely resembled
  protoplasm, the basic life substance."</p>

  <p>"And the white things&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Were white blood corpuscles from the veins of a human being. They were
  the strongest of the human body cells to resist assimilation and consequently
  the last to succumb. The red corpuscles turned the liquid pink for a while
  but they had disappeared before we made our microscopic examination."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, why didn't you tell me this before?", demanded the chief.
  "Let's go up and destroy the stuff now. Those two men up there might be
  killed any minute."</p>

  <p>We found the two policemen unharmed and made our plans for the destruction
  of the substance in the-tank. Several demijohns of acid stood under the table
  and the doctor selected one nearly full of sulphuric acid.</p>

  <p>"Open the windows," he ordered. "This is going to make a horrible
  stench."</p>

  <p>Then he removed the rubber stopper from the mouth of the demijohn and I
  helped him hoist it to the edge of the tank. The searing liquid struck the
  heavy fluid in the tank with a hissing sound and bored into it like hot water
  poured in a snow bank. The jelly-like mass quivered slightly, and pungent,
  nauseating fumes arose to torment our nostrils.</p>

  <p>Then, suddenly, as if in horrible pain and awakened to the danger of its
  dissolution, the plasmic substance began to heave and billow toward the top
  of the tank with a movement suggestive of the writhing of a huge coiled
  serpent in its death agony. By directing the stream of acid at the various
  peaks that arose we endeavored to keep it all washed down to a common level.
  Then a dozen peaks rose simultaneously and I noticed that one was capped with
  a round ball in the center of which was a black spot.</p>

  <p>"The nucleus!" cried the doctor excitedly, shifting the demijohn. "Pour it
  on the nucleus!"</p>

  <p>We were too late. The thing upreared itself with amazing speed and lopped
  over the edge of the tank opposite us. We dropped the nearly-emptied demijohn
  into the tank and rushed around to intercept it, just in time to see the ball
  containing the black spot separate itself from the stringy mass by which it
  was suspended, drop to the floor and roll under the table.</p>

  <p>An exciting chase of several minutes ensued. The thing darted, or rather,
  rolled from place to place with amazing rapidity. The tile floor was cracked
  in a dozen places by blows from the clubs of the two policemen who assisted
  us. At length we drove it into the corner beneath the lavatory and advanced
  in close formation. I had armed myself with a large spatula, the doctor
  gripped a heavy pestle, the two policemen had their clubs and the chief held
  his automatic pistol in readiness.</p>

  <p>As we drew close we moved with extreme caution, our nerves taut, our
  weapons ready to strike when the thing should make its dash for liberty. We
  waited breathlessly, but no movement came from the corner. I prodded the
  space behind the water pipes with my spatula. Still no sign of the thing we
  were after. Then I peered behind them and saw the reason&mdash;a hole an inch
  in diameter in the tile floor, probably drilled in the wrong place by a
  careless plumber and left unfilled because it was out of sight.</p>

  <p>When I pointed it out to Dr. Dorp he shook his head solemnly.</p>

  <p>"The Malignant Entity has escaped," he said. "No one in this
  house&mdash;in this community, even&mdash;is safe until it is captured or
  killed."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to tell me that little thing we were chasing around the
  room could kill anybody," said the chief.</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure that it could kill any one now that it has been reduced
  to the size of a golf ball, although the cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus
  evidently has the power of quickly dissolving and assimilating living
  tissues. Its growth, apparently, is only limited by the amount of food it can
  find."</p>

  <p>"Maybe we'd better get the women out of the house," said the chief.</p>

  <p>"The sooner, the better. I suggest also that you surround the place with
  men armed with shotguns. If that thing gets out and starts to grow I shudder
  to think of what may happen. Children will not be safe outside their own
  homes, and perhaps not even within them. Adults will be attacked as soon as
  the creature has attained sufficient size, and there is always the
  possibility that it may have the power to reproduce its kind. Organisms of
  this kind, as a rule, multiply with exceeding rapidity. Think of a thousand
  or perhaps a million such monsters roaming through the land. It is almost
  impossible to kill them because of the power we have just witnessed, of
  leaving the body, no matter how large it has grown, taking with it only
  enough cytoplasm to protect the nucleus and make a new start."</p>

  <p>We were all gasping from the fumes that came out of the tank, and glad to
  get out of the laboratory.</p>

  <p>When all were assembled in the living room the chief phoned headquarters
  for men and shotguns while Dr. Dorp and I explained what we had found to Miss
  Townsend.</p>

  <p>After we had described our adventure in detail, the doctor said:</p>

  <p>"It seems strange that your father left no records of his experiments with
  the monster."</p>

  <p>"I feel quite sure that he left a record of some sort, though I have never
  seen it," replied Miss Townsend.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea where it is?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps in his safe in the study."</p>

  <p>"I do not remember seeing a safe in the study." "Naturally. It is hidden.
  Come and I will show you where it is."</p>

  <p>We followed her into the study and she swung back one of the bookcases
  which was hung on concealed hinges, revealing a small wall safe,</p>

  <p>"Would you mind opening it for us?" asked the doctor.</p>

  <p>She turned the dial to number twelve, then pulled the lever. It did not
  move. She seemed surprised, set the dial more carefully and tried again with
  the same result.</p>

  <p>"It's no use, I guess," she said. "The last number of the combination is
  twelve. He usually turned it back to one and then it was only necessary to
  turn it to twelve to open it. He must have locked it last night."</p>

  <p>"Don't you know the combination?"</p>

  <p>"No. Father was the only one who knew that." "I wonder if you would object
  to our blowing the safe," he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not if it will be of any assistance to you."</p>

  <p>Chief McGraw, who had just finished calling headquarters, came into the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Think you can get us a safe-cracker tonight, Chief?" asked the
  doctor.</p>

  <p>"Get you most anything you want. What's in the safe?"</p>

  <p>"We believe it contains some valuable information regarding the thing we
  were chasing a while ago." "I'll get a man out here right away," said McGraw,
  going once more to the phone.</p>

  <p>Officer Burke escorted Miss Townsend, Mrs. Harms and the two servants to
  the Harms home, where they were to spend the night.</p>

  <p>Shortly afterward there arrived twenty policemen armed with shotguns and
  carrying several dozen bulls-eye lanterns. They brought extra weapons which
  were distributed to all of us who remained in the house, the chief, the
  doctor, the four policemen and myself. Burke was to remain on guard next
  door.</p>

  <p>A ring of lanterns was placed around the house and the twenty armed men
  were posted at intervals between them. We then divided our forces as follows:
  One policeman was placed on guard in the laboratory. Chief McGraw with
  another policeman patrolled the upper rooms and halls. The doctor and one
  policeman remained on the first floor and I, accompanied by a strapping young
  fellow named Black, who had recently been admitted to the force, did sentry
  duty in the basement.</p><br>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">Theorizing</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE Townsend basement was divided into three rooms, each
  lighted rather dimly by the yellow rays from an incandescent globe suspended
  on a short drop-cord. The furnace room and coal bins were situated at the
  rear end. The middle compartment contained a miscellaneous assortment of
  boxes, barrels, garden tools, household tools, canned fruits, empty fruit
  jars, bottles, and what not. The front room was used as a laundry.</p>

  <p>Officer Black and I searched each room thoroughly, using a flash light in
  the dark corners and moving everything that wasn't fastened to the floor or
  walls. Several mice jumped out from behind boxes and barrels, but we saw no
  sign of the creature we were hunting.</p>

  <p>We were peering behind the furnace when several loud squeaks came to us
  from the middle room.</p>

  <p>With shotgun held in readiness, I moved stealthily toward the point from
  which the sound came. There, in the center of the floor almost under the
  yellow electric light bulb, I saw the fast disappearing body of a mouse under
  a mass of plasmic jelly.</p>

  <p>My first impulse was to shoot, but on second thought, I decided to attempt
  to capture the thing alive if possible. Instructing Black to hold his weapon
  in readiness in case I failed, I unscrewed the lid from a large empty fruit
  jar and walked softly toward the center of the floor. I expected the thing to
  spring away, but to my surprise it lay almost motionless on the body of its
  victim. I could see streaks of bright red flowing through the jelly-like mass
  as blood of the mouse was drawn up for assimilation.</p>

  <p>I clapped the mouth of the jar over the creature and still it made no
  effort to escape. Then, sliding a fire shovel which Black brought me, under
  the thing and its victim, I turned the jar right side up. It fell to the
  bottom of the receptacle, still clinging to the now formless mass that had
  once been a mouse and making no effort to escape. I put the lid in place and
  screwed it down tight.</p>

  <p>"Now try to get away, you devil!" I cried, shaking the jar exultantly.</p>

  <p>I almost dropped it a moment later as a muffled explosion jarred the
  building. Then I remembered Chief McGraw's safe-cracker, and hurried
  upstairs.</p>

  <p>When I reached the living-room, Dr. Dorp was emerging from the study in a
  cloud of plaster dust. In his hand was a thick, loose-leaf book.</p>

  <p>"I have the professor's diary," he called excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Don't get fussed over such trifles," I replied. "Look what I've got.
  Caught it alive, too."</p>

  <p>I put the jar on the table and he squinted at it for a moment. The blood-
  bloated monstrosity had separated its shapeless hulk from the whitened bones
  of its victim and was sluggishly crawling up the side of the glass.</p>

  <p>"You caught it, sure enough," he said. "I only hope it hasn't any little
  sons or daughters about."</p>

  <p>"I'll keep the house under guard for a couple of days," said Chief McGraw,
  who had come down to learn the result of the cracksman's labors. "If there
  are any more of these things around they ought to show themselves by that
  time."</p>

  <p>The doctor drew a chair up to the table and eagerly scanned the pages of
  the diary while we watched the antics of the thing in the jar. It kept
  getting lighter colored all the time, and more lively. By the time the
  cytoplasm had become transparent it was racing around, contorting its body
  into all kinds of shapes&mdash;flat, oval, and round. At times it put forth
  pseudopods, sometimes elongating them until it resembled a small cuttle
  fish.</p>

  <p>"September twenty-third was the night Immune Benny died wasn't it, Chief?"
  asked the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Right. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Then this diary tallies with Miss Townsend's testimony. Here is the
  professor's entry.</p>

  <p>"'September 23, Nearly Midnight.</p>

  <p>"'Eureka! I have succeeded. I placed a tiny drop of syntheplasm on the
  slide tonight as 1 have done a thousand times before, and covered it with a
  weak, sterile solution of gelatine.</p>

  <p>"'I watched it steadily for a half hour but nothing happened until,
  suddenly, I noticed a tiny black spot forming in its center. I am positive
  there were no animalcules either in the syntheplasm or the solution, yet no
  sooner had the black spot become readily distinguishable than my speck of
  syntheplasm began moving about as if searching for food. Evidently it cannot
  subsist on gelatine.</p>

  <p>"'I next introduced a rhizopod into the solution. -My animal slightly
  resembles it, but is larger and gets about much faster. I wanted to compare
  the two but the rhizopod was quickly devoured; Now I know what to feed
  it.'"</p>

  <p>"It is growing late so I will not read all the details to you," continued
  the doctor. "Suffice to say that the professor discovered his synthetically
  created creature would feed on nothing but living creatures. He fed it so
  many microscopic animals the second day that it grew to a size visible to the
  naked eye. Then he fed it gnats, mosquitos, flies, beetles, and finally mice,
  when it became so large he was forced to transfer it from the small porcelain
  dish in which he kept it, to a much larger one.</p>

  <p>"The thing grew at a prodigious rate of speed. Its growth seemed only
  limited by the amount of living creatures it was permitted to devour-. At
  length he was compelled to keep it in the glass-lined tank which he had been
  using for the culture of infusoria. Its victims were thrown into the tank
  alive and were quickly killed by the monster. He noticed that it was sluggish
  while assimilating its food, but moved with cat-like quickness when hungry.
  Though it had no eyes it seemed to sense the approach of food in some way
  and, toward the last, stretched forth pseudopods and snatched the animals
  from his hands.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday the professor led two mastiffs into the room. Hardly had he
  closed the door of the laboratory before the monster was out of the tank.</p>

  <p>It killed and devoured the two big dogs in less than a half
  hour&mdash;then crawled back sluggishly into the tank to digest its meal.
  Thus ends the written record of the professor's adventures with the Malignant
  Entity. His whitened bones on the floor of the laboratory are mute testimony
  of what occurred."</p>

  <p>There was a moment of awed silence when the doctor finished his narrative.
  His eyes fell on the struggling thing in the glass jar.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with it?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, taking up the jar and starting for the basement. "I will
  show you."</p>

  <p>The chief and I followed him down the basement stairs and into the furnace
  room. He opened the fire-door and tossed the jar on the glowing coals.</p>

  <p>The thing raced about spasmodically for a moment in the intense heat, then
  fell huddled in the bottom of the jar. Suddenly, as if inflated from beneath,
  it puffed upward and outward, almost filling the receptacle in a shape that
  resembled a human head. I thought this only a figment of my imagination at
  first&mdash;blinked&mdash;and yet a second time. The face of a man stared
  back at me from behind the curved glass, eyes glowing with malevolent hatred,
  and lips drawn back in a snarl that revealed crooked, yellow fangs. For a
  moment only the vision held. The next instant the jar was empty of all save a
  tiny pile of white, flaky ash and the bones of the mouse.</p>

  <p>Dr. Dorp shut the door suddenly and noisily.</p>

  <p>"That face," I exclaimed. "Did you see it also?"</p>

  <p>"A queer distortion of the gas-inflated protoplasm," he replied.</p>

  <p>Chief McGraw seemed greatly perturbed. He drew a long black cigar from his
  pocket, lighted it and puffed nervously for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Distortion, hell," he muttered. <i>"It was a perfect double for the face
  of Immune Benny!"</i></p>
