<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>
<h3>THE ADVENTURE OF THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY</h3>
<p>On the day when I found myself with twopence in my pocket, I
naturally made up my mind to go round the world.</p>
<p>It was my stepfather's death that drove me to it. I had never
seen my stepfather. Indeed, I never even thought of him as anything
more than Colonel Watts-Morgan. I owed him nothing, except my
poverty. He married my dear mother when I was a girl at school in
Switzerland; and he proceeded to spend her little fortune, left at
her sole disposal by my father's will, in paying his gambling
debts. After that, he carried my dear mother off to Burma; and when
he and the climate between them had succeeded in killing her, he
made up for his appropriations at the cheapest rate by allowing me
just enough to send me to Girton. So, when the Colonel died, in the
year I was leaving college, I did not think it necessary to go into
mourning for him. Especially as he chose the precise moment when my
allowance was due, and bequeathed me nothing but his consolidated
liabilities.</p>
<p>'Of course you will teach,' said Elsie Petheridge,
when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg
2]</a></span> I explained my affairs to her. 'There is a good
demand just now for high-school teachers.'</p>
<p>I looked at her, aghast. '<i>Teach!</i> Elsie,' I cried. (I had
come up to town to settle her in at her unfurnished lodgings.) 'Did
you say <i>teach</i>? That's just like you dear good
schoolmistresses! You go to Cambridge, and get examined till the
heart and life have been examined out of you; then you say to
yourselves at the end of it all, "Let me see; what am I good for
now? I'm just about fit to go away and examine other people!"
That's what our Principal would call "a vicious circle"&mdash;if
one could ever admit there was anything vicious at all about
<i>you</i>, dear. No, Elsie, I do <i>not</i> propose to teach.
Nature did not cut me out for a high-school teacher. I couldn't
swallow a poker if I tried for weeks. Pokers don't agree with me.
Between ourselves, I am a bit of a rebel.'</p>
<p>'You are, Brownie,' she answered, pausing in her papering, with
her sleeves rolled up&mdash;they called me 'Brownie,' partly
because of my dark complexion, but partly because they could never
understand me. 'We all knew that long ago.'</p>
<p>I laid down the paste-brush and mused.</p>
<p>'Do you remember, Elsie,' I said, staring hard at the
paper-board,' when I first went to Girton, how all you girls wore
your hair quite straight, in neat smooth coils, plaited up at the
back about the size of a pancake; and how of a sudden I burst in
upon you, like a tropical hurricane, and demoralised you; and how,
after three days of me, some of the dear innocents began with awe
to cut themselves artless fringes, while others went out in fear
and trembling and surreptitiously purchased a pair of
curling-tongs? I was a bomb-shell in your midst in those days; why,
you yourself were almost afraid at first to speak to
me.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg
3]</a></span></p>
<p>'You see, you had a bicycle,' Elsie put in, smoothing the
half-papered wall; 'and in those days, of course, ladies didn't
bicycle. You must admit, Brownie, dear, it <i>was</i> a startling
innovation. You terrified us so. And yet, after all, there isn't
much harm in you.'</p>
<p>'I hope not,' I said devoutly. 'I was before my time, that was
all; at present, even a curate's wife may blamelessly bicycle.'</p>
<p>'But if you don't teach,' Elsie went on, gazing at me with those
wondering big blue eyes of hers, 'whatever will you do, Brownie?'
Her horizon was bounded by the scholastic circle.</p>
<p>'I haven't the faintest idea,' I answered, continuing to paste.
'Only, as I can't trespass upon your elegant hospitality for life,
whatever I mean to do, I must begin doing this morning, when we've
finished the papering. I couldn't teach' (teaching, like mauve, is
the refuge of the incompetent); 'and I don't, if possible, want to
sell bonnets.'</p>
<p>'As a milliner's girl?' Elsie asked, with a face of red
horror.</p>
<p>'As a milliner's girl; why not? 'Tis an honest calling. Earls'
daughters do it now. But you needn't look so shocked. I tell you,
just at present, I am not contemplating it.'</p>
<p>'Then what <i>do</i> you contemplate?'</p>
<p>I paused and reflected. 'I am here in London,' I answered,
gazing rapt at the ceiling; 'London, whose streets are paved with
gold&mdash;though it <i>looks</i> at first sight like muddy
flagstones; London, the greatest and richest city in the world,
where an adventurous soul ought surely to find some loophole for an
adventure. (That piece is hung crooked, dear; we shall have to take
it down again.) I devise a Plan, therefore. I submit myself to
fate; or, if you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id=
"Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> prefer it, I leave my future in the
hands of Providence. I shall stroll out this morning, as soon as
I've "cleaned myself," and embrace the first stray enterprise that
offers. Our Bagdad teems with enchanted carpets. Let one but float
my way, and, hi, presto, I seize it. I go where glory or a modest
competence waits me. I snatch at the first offer, the first hint of
an opening.'</p>
<p>Elsie stared at me, more aghast and more puzzled than ever.
'But, how?' she asked. 'Where? When? You <i>are</i> so strange!
What will you do to find one?'</p>
<p>'Put on my hat and walk out,' I answered. 'Nothing could be
simpler. This city bursts with enterprises and surprises. Strangers
from east and west hurry through it in all directions. Omnibuses
traverse it from end to end&mdash;even, I am told, to Islington and
Putney; within, folk sit face to face who never saw one another
before in their lives, and who may never see one another again, or,
on the contrary, may pass the rest of their days together.'</p>
<p>I had a lovely harangue all pat in my head, in much the same
strain, on the infinite possibilities of entertaining angels
unawares, in cabs, on the Underground, in the a&euml;rated bread
shops; but Elsie's widening eyes of horror pulled me up short like
a hansom in Piccadilly when the inexorable upturned hand of the
policeman checks it. 'Oh, Brownie,' she cried, drawing back, 'you
<i>don't</i> mean to tell me you're going to ask the first young

title=""> <span class="caption">I AM GOING OUT, SIMPLY IN SEARCH OF
ADVENTURE.</span></div>
<p>I shrieked with laughter, 'Elsie,' I cried, kissing her dear
yellow little head, 'you are <i>impayable</i>. You never will learn
what I mean. You don't understand the language. No, no; I am going
out, simply in search of adventure. What adventure may come, I have
not at this moment the faintest conception. The fun lies in the
search, the uncertainty, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5"
id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> toss-up of it. What is the good of
being penniless&mdash;with the trifling exception of
twopence&mdash;unless you are prepared to accept your position in
the spirit of a masked ball at Covent Garden?'</p>
<p>'I have never been to one,' Elsie put in.</p>
<p>'Gracious heavens, neither have I! What on earth do you take me
for? But I mean to see where fate will lead me.'</p>
<p>'I may go with you?' Elsie pleaded.</p>
<p>'Certainly <i>not</i>, my child,' I answered&mdash;she was
three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg
6]</a></span> years older than I, so I had the right to patronise
her. 'That would spoil all. Your dear little face would be quite
enough to scare away a timid adventure.' She knew what I meant. It
was gentle and pensive, but it lacked initiative.</p>
<p>So, when we had finished that wall, I popped on my best hat, and
popped out by myself into Kensington Gardens.</p>
<p>I am told I ought to have been terribly alarmed at the straits
in which I found myself&mdash;a girl of twenty-one, alone in the
world, and only twopence short of penniless, without a friend to
protect, a relation to counsel her. (I don't count Aunt Susan, who
lurked in ladylike indigence at Blackheath, and whose counsel, like
her tracts, was given away too profusely to everybody to allow of
one's placing any very high value upon it.) But, as a matter of
fact, I must admit I was not in the least alarmed. Nature had
endowed me with a profusion of crisp black hair, and plenty of high
spirits. If my eyes had been like Elsie's&mdash;that liquid blue
which looks out upon life with mingled pity and amazement&mdash;I
might have felt as a girl ought to feel under such conditions; but
having large dark eyes, with a bit of a twinkle in them, and being
as well able to pilot a bicycle as any girl of my acquaintance, I
have inherited or acquired an outlook on the world which distinctly
leans rather towards cheeriness than despondency. I croak with
difficulty. So I accepted my plight as an amusing experience,
affording full scope for the congenial exercise of courage and
ingenuity.</p>
<p>How boundless are the opportunities of Kensington
Gardens&mdash;the Round Pond, the winding Serpentine, the
mysterious seclusion of the Dutch brick Palace! Genii swarm there.
One jostles possibilities. It is a land of romance, bounded on the
north by the Abyss of Bayswater, and on the south by the
Amphitheatre of the Albert Hall. But for a centre of adventure I
choose the Long Walk; it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id=
"Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> beckoned me somewhat as the North-West
Passage beckoned my seafaring ancestors&mdash;the buccaneering
mariners of Elizabethan Devon. I sat down on a chair at the foot of
an old elm with a poetic hollow, prosaically filled by a
utilitarian plate of galvanised iron. Two ancient ladies were
seated on the other side already&mdash;very grand-looking dames,
with the haughty and exclusive ugliness of the English aristocracy
in its later stages. For frank hideousness, commend me to the noble
dowager. They were talking confidentially as I sat down; the
trifling episode of my approach did not suffice to stem the full
stream of their conversation. The great ignore the intrusion of
their inferiors.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;"><a name="ILL_004" id=

height="387" alt="OUI, MADAME; MERCI BEAUCOUP, MADAME." title="">
<span class="caption">OUI, MADAME; MERCI BEAUCOUP,
MADAME.</span></div>
<p>'Yes, it's a terrible nuisance,' the eldest and ugliest of the
two observed&mdash;she was a high-born lady, with a distinctly
cantankerous cast of countenance. She had a Roman nose, and her
skin was wrinkled like a wilted apple; she wore coffee-coloured
point-lace in her bonnet, with a complexion to match. 'But what
could I do, my dear? I simply <i>couldn't</i> put up with such
insolence. So I looked her straight back in the face&mdash;oh, she
quailed, I can tell you; and I said to her, in my iciest
voice&mdash;you know how icy I can be when occasion demands
it'&mdash;the second old lady nodded an ungrudging assent, as if
perfectly prepared to admit her friend's rare gift of
iciness&mdash;'I said to her, "C&eacute;lestine, you can take your
month's wages, and half an hour to get out of this house." And she
dropped me a deep reverence, and she answered: "<i>Oui, madame;
merci beaucoup, madame; je ne desire pas mieux, madame.</i>" And
out she flounced. So there was the end of it.'</p>
<p>'Still, you go to Schlangenbad on Monday?'</p>
<p>'That's the point. On Monday. If it weren't for the journey, I
should have been glad enough to be rid of the minx. I'm glad as it
is, indeed; for a more insolent, upstanding,<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
independent, answer-you-back-again young woman, with a sneer of her
own, <i>I</i> never saw, Amelia&mdash;but I <i>must</i> get to
Schlangenbad. Now, there the difficulty comes in. On the one hand,
if I engage a maid in London, I have the choice of two evils.
Either I must take a trapesing English girl&mdash;and I know by
experience that an English girl on the Continent is a vast deal
worse than no maid at all: <i>you</i> have to wait upon <i>her</i>,
instead of her waiting upon you; she gets seasick on the crossing,
and when she reaches France or Germany, she hates the meals, and
she detests the hotel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id=
"Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> servants, and she can't speak the
language, so that she's always calling you in to interpret for her
in her private differences with the <i>fille-de-chambre</i> and the
landlord; or else I must pick up a French maid in London, and I
know equally by experience that the French maids one engages in
London are invariably dishonest&mdash;more dishonest than the rest
even; they've come here because they have no character to speak of
elsewhere, and they think you aren't likely to write and enquire of
their last mistress in Toulouse or St. Petersburg. Then, again, on
the other hand, I can't wait to get a Gretchen, an unsophisticated
little Gretchen of the Taunus at Schlangenbad&mdash; I suppose
there <i>are</i> unsophisticated girls in Germany still&mdash;made
in Germany&mdash;they don't make 'em any longer in England, I'm
sure&mdash;like everything else, the trade in rustic innocence has
been driven from the country. I can't wait to get a Gretchen, as I
should like to do, of course, because I simply <i>daren't</i>
undertake to cross the Channel alone and go all that long journey
by Ostend or Calais, Brussels and Cologne, to Schlangenbad.'</p>
<p>'You could get a temporary maid,' her friend suggested, in a
lull of the tornado.</p>
<p>The Cantankerous Old Lady flared up. 'Yes, and have my
jewel-case stolen! Or find she was an English girl without one word
of German. Or nurse her on the boat when I want to give my
undivided attention to my own misfortunes. No, Amelia, I call it
positively unkind of you to suggest such a thing. You're <i>so</i>
unsympathetic! I put my foot down there. I will <i>not</i> take any
temporary person.'</p>
<p>I saw my chance. This was a delightful idea. Why not start for
Schlangenbad with the Cantankerous Old Lady?</p>
<p>Of course, I had not the slightest intention of taking a
lady's-maid's place for a permanency. Nor even, if it
comes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg
10]</a></span> to that, as a passing expedient. But <i>if</i> I
wanted to go round the world, how could I do better than set out by
the Rhine country? The Rhine leads you on to the Danube, the Danube
to the Black Sea, the Black Sea to Asia; and so, by way of India,
China, and Japan, you reach the Pacific and San Francisco; whence
one returns quite easily by New York and the White Star Liners. I
began to feel like a globe-trotter already; the Cantankerous Old
Lady was the thin end of the wedge&mdash;the first rung of the
ladder! I proceeded to put my foot on it.</p>

"EXCUSE ME, I SAID, BUT I THINK I SEE A WAY OUT OF YOUR DIFFICULTY."
title=""> <span class="caption">EXCUSE ME, I SAID, BUT I THINK I
SEE A WAY OUT OF YOUR DIFFICULTY.</span></div>
<p>I leaned around the corner of the tree and spoke.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> 'Excuse
me,' I said, in my suavest voice, 'but I think I see a way out of
your difficulty.'</p>
<p>My first impression was that the Cantankerous Old Lady would go
off in a fit of apoplexy. She grew purple in the face with
indignation and astonishment, that a casual outsider should venture
to address her; so much so, indeed, that for a second I almost
regretted my well-meant interposition. Then she scanned me up and
down, as if I were a girl in a mantle shop, and she contemplated
buying either me or the mantle. At last, catching my eye, she
thought better of it, and burst out laughing.</p>
<p>'What do you mean by this eavesdropping?' she asked.</p>
<p>I flushed up in turn. 'This is a public place,' I replied, with
dignity; 'and you spoke in a tone which was hardly designed for the
strictest privacy. If you don't wish to be overheard, you oughtn't
to shout. Besides, I desired to do you a service.'</p>
<p>The Cantankerous Old Lady regarded me once more from head to
foot. I did not quail. Then she turned to her companion. 'The girl
has spirit,' she remarked, in an encouraging tone, as if she were
discussing some absent person. 'Upon my word, Amelia, I rather like
the look of her. Well, my good woman, what do you want to suggest
to me?'</p>
<p>'Merely this,' I replied, bridling up and crushing her. 'I am a
Girton girl, an officer's daughter, no more a good woman than most
others of my class; and I have nothing in particular to do for the
moment. I don't object to going to Schlangenbad. I would convoy you
over, as companion, or lady-help, or anything else you choose to
call it; I would remain with you there for a week, till you could
arrange with your Gretchen, presumably unsophisticated; and then I
would leave you. Salary is unimportant; my fare
suffices.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg
12]</a></span> I accept the chance as a cheap opportunity of
attaining Schlangenbad.'</p>
<p>The yellow-faced old lady put up her long-handled tortoise-shell
eyeglasses and inspected me all over again. 'Well, I declare,' she
murmured. 'What are girls coming to, I wonder? Girton, you say;
Girton! That place at Cambridge! You speak Greek, of course; but
how about German?'</p>
<p>'Like a native,' I answered, with cheerful promptitude. 'I was
at school in Canton Berne; it is a mother tongue to me.'</p>
<p>'No, no,' the old lady went on, fixing her keen small eyes on my
mouth. 'Those little lips could never frame themselves to
"schlecht" or "wundersch&ouml;n"; they were not cut out for
it.'</p>
<p>'Pardon me,' I answered, in German. 'What I say, that I mean.
The never-to-be-forgotten music of the Fatherland's-speech has on
my infant ear from the first-beginning impressed itself.'</p>
<p>The old lady laughed aloud.</p>
<p>'Don't jabber it to me, child,' she cried. 'I hate the lingo.
It's the one tongue on earth that even a pretty girl's lips fail to
render attractive. You yourself make faces over it. What's your
name, young woman?'</p>
<p>'Lois Cayley.'</p>
<p>'Lois! <i>What</i> a name! I never heard of any Lois in my life
before, except Timothy's grandmother. <i>You're</i> not anybody's
grandmother, are you?'</p>
<p>'Not to my knowledge,' I answered, gravely.</p>
<p>She burst out laughing again.</p>
<p>'Well, you'll do, I think,' she said, catching my arm. 'That big
mill down yonder hasn't ground the originality altogether out of
you. I adore originality. It was clever<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> of you
to catch at the suggestion of this arrangement. Lois Cayley, you
say; any relation of a madcap Captain Cayley whom I used once to
know, in the Forty-second Highlanders?'</p>
<p>'His daughter,' I answered, flushing. For I was proud of my
father.</p>
<p>'Ha! I remember; he died, poor fellow; he was a good
soldier&mdash;and his'&mdash;I felt she was going to say 'his fool
of a widow,' but a glance from me quelled her; 'his widow went and
married that good-looking scapegrace, Jack Watts-Morgan. Never
marry a man, my dear, with a double-barrelled name and no visible
means of subsistence; above all, if he's generally known by a
nickname. So you're poor Tom Cayley's daughter, are you? Well,
well, we can settle this little matter between us. Mind, I'm a
person who always expects to have my own way. If you come with
<i>me</i> to Schlangenbad, you must do as I tell you.'</p>
<p>'I <i>think</i> I could manage it&mdash;for a week,' I answered,
demurely.</p>
<p>She smiled at my audacity. We passed on to terms. They were
quite satisfactory. She wanted no references. 'Do I look like a
woman who cares about a reference? What are called
<i>characters</i> are usually essays in how not to say it. You take
my fancy; that's the point! And poor Tom Cayley! But, mind, I will
<i>not</i> be contradicted.'</p>
<p>'I will not contradict your wildest misstatement,' I answered,
smiling.</p>
<p>'<i>And</i> your name and address?' I asked, after we had
settled preliminaries.</p>
<p>A faint red spot rose quaintly in the centre of the Cantankerous
Old Lady's sallow cheek. 'My dear,' she murmured, 'my name is the
one thing on earth I'm really ashamed of. My parents chose to
inflict upon me the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id=
"Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> odious label that human ingenuity ever
devised for a Christian soul; and I've not had courage enough to
burst out and change it.'</p>
<p>A gleam of intuition flashed across me, 'You don't mean to say,'
I exclaimed, 'that you're called Georgina?'</p>
<p>The Cantankerous Old Lady gripped my arm hard. 'What an
unusually intelligent girl!' she broke in. 'How on earth did you
guess? It <i>is</i> Georgina.'</p>
<p>'Fellow-feeling,' I answered. 'So is mine, Georgina Lois. But as
I quite agree with you as to the atrocity of such conduct, I have
suppressed the Georgina. It ought to be made penal to send innocent
girls into the world so burdened.'</p>
<p>'My opinion to a T! You are really an exceptionally sensible
young woman. There's my name and address; I start on Monday.'</p>
<p>I glanced at her card. The very copperplate was noisy. 'Lady
Georgina Fawley, 49 Fortescue Crescent, W.'</p>
<p>It had taken us twenty minutes to arrange our protocols. As I
walked off, well pleased, Lady Georgina's friend ran after me
quickly.</p>
<p>'You must take care,' she said, in a warning voice. 'You've
caught a Tartar.'</p>
<p>'So I suspect,' I answered. 'But a week in Tartary will be at
least an experience.'</p>
<p>'She has an awful temper.'</p>
<p>'That's nothing. So have I. Appalling, I assure you. And if it
comes to blows, I'm bigger and younger and stronger than she
is.'</p>
<p>'Well, I wish you well out of it.'</p>
<p>'Thank you. It is kind of you to give me this warning. But I
think I can take care of myself. I come, you see, of a military
family.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg
15]</a></span></p>
<p>I nodded my thanks, and strolled back to Elsie's. Dear little
Elsie was in transports of surprise when I related my
adventure.</p>
<p>'Will you really go? And what will you do, my dear, when you get
there?'</p>
<p>'I haven't a notion,' I answered; 'that's where the fun comes
in. But, anyhow, I shall have got there.'</p>
<p>'Oh, Brownie, you might starve!'</p>
<p>'And I might starve in London. In either place, I have only two
hands and one head to help me.'</p>
<p>'But, then, here you are among friends. You might stop with me
for ever.'</p>
<p>I kissed her fluffy forehead. 'You good, generous little Elsie,'
I cried; 'I won't stop here one moment after I have finished the
painting and papering. I came here to help you. I couldn't go on
eating your hard-earned bread and doing nothing. I know how sweet
you are; but the last thing I want is to add to your burdens. Now
let us roll up our sleeves again and hurry on with the dado.'</p>
<p>'But, Brownie, you'll want to be getting your own things ready.
Remember, you're off to Germany on Monday.'</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders. 'Tis a foreign trick I picked up in
Switzerland. 'What have I got to get ready?' I asked. 'I can't go
out and buy a complete summer outfit in Bond Street for twopence.
Now, don't look at me like that: be practical, Elsie, and let me
help you paint the dado.' For unless I helped her, poor Elsie could
never have finished it herself. I cut out half her clothes for her;
her own ideas were almost entirely limited to differential
calculus. And cutting out a blouse by differential calculus is
weary, uphill work for a high-school teacher.</p>
<p>By Monday I had papered and furnished the rooms, and was ready
to start on my voyage of exploration. I met<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> the
Cantankerous Old Lady at Charing Cross, by appointment, and
proceeded to take charge of her luggage and tickets.</p>
<p>Oh my, how fussy she was! 'You will drop that basket! I hope you
have got through tickets, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Malines, <i>not</i> by
Brussels&mdash; I won't go by Brussels. You have to change there.
Now, mind you notice how much the luggage weighs in English pounds,
and make the man at the office give you a note of it to check those
horrid Belgian porters. They'll charge you for double the weight,
unless you reduce it at once to kilogrammes. <i>I</i> know their
ways. Foreigners have no consciences. They just go to the priest
and confess, you know, and wipe it all out, and start fresh again
on a career of crime next morning. I'm sure I don't know why I
<i>ever</i> go abroad. The only country in the world fit to live in
is England. No mosquitoes, no passports, no&mdash;goodness
gracious, child, don't let that odious man bang about my hat-box!
Have you no immortal soul, porter, that you crush other people's
property as if it was blackbeetles? No, I will not let you take
this, Lois; this is my jewel-box&mdash;it contains all that remains
of the Fawley family jewels. I positively decline to appear at
Schlangenbad without a diamond to my back. This never leaves my
hands. It's hard enough nowadays to keep body and skirt together.
<i>Have</i> you secured that <i>coup&eacute;</i> at Ostend?'</p>

<span class="caption">A MOST URBANE AND OBLIGING CONTINENTAL
GENTLEMAN.</span></div>
<p>We got into our first-class carriage. It was clean and
comfortable; but the Cantankerous Old Lady made the porter mop the
floor, and fidgeted and worried till we slid out of the station.
Fortunately, the only other occupant of the compartment was a most
urbane and obliging Continental gentleman&mdash;I say Continental,
because I couldn't quite make out whether he was French, German, or
Austrian&mdash;who was anxious in every way to meet Lady
Georgina's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg
17]</a></span> wishes. Did madame desire to have the window open?
Oh, certainly, with pleasure; the day was so sultry. Closed a
little more? <i>Parfaitement</i>, there <i>was</i> a current of
air, <i>il faut l'admettre</i>. Madame would prefer the corner? No?
Then perhaps she would like this valise for a footstool?
<i>Permettez</i>&mdash;just thus. A cold draught runs so often
along the floor in railway carriages. This is Kent that we
traverse; ah, the garden of England! As a diplomat, he knew every
nook of Europe, and he echoed the <i>mot</i> he had accidentally
heard drop from madame's lips on<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> the platform: no country
in the world so delightful as England!</p>
<p>'Monsieur is attached to the Embassy in London?' Lady Georgina
inquired, growing affable.</p>
<p>He twirled his grey moustache: a waxed moustache of great
distinction. 'No, madame; I have quitted the diplomatic service; I
inhabit London now <i>pour mon agr&eacute;ment</i>. Some of my
compatriots call it <i>triste</i>; for me, I find it the most
fascinating capital in Europe. What gaiety! What movement! What
poetry! What mystery!'</p>
<p>'If mystery means fog, it challenges the world,' I
interposed.</p>
<p>He gazed at me with fixed eyes. 'Yes, mademoiselle,' he
answered, in quite a different and markedly chilly voice. 'Whatever
your great country attempts&mdash;were it only a fog&mdash;it
achieves consummately.'</p>
<p>I have quick intuitions. I felt the foreign gentleman took an
instinctive dislike to me.</p>
<p>To make up for it, he talked much, and with animation, to Lady
Georgina. They ferreted out friends in common, and were as much
surprised at it as people always are at that inevitable
experience.</p>
<p>'Ah yes, madame, I recollect him well in Vienna. I was there at
the time, attached to our Legation. He was a charming man; you read
his masterly paper on the Central Problem of the Dual Empire?'</p>
<p>'You were in Vienna then!' the Cantankerous Old Lady mused back.
'Lois, my child, don't stare'&mdash;she had covenanted from the
first to call me Lois, as my father's daughter, and I confess I
preferred it to being Miss Cayley'd. 'We must surely have met. Dare
I ask your name, monsieur?'</p>
<p>I could see the foreign gentleman was delighted at
this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg
19]</a></span> turn. He had played for it, and carried his point.
He meant her to ask him. He had a card in his pocket, conveniently
close; and he handed it across to her. She read it, and passed it
on: 'M. le Comte de Laroche-sur-Loiret.'</p>
<p>'Oh, I remember your name well,' the Cantankerous Old Lady broke
in. 'I think you knew my husband, Sir Evelyn Fawley, and my father,
Lord Kynaston.'</p>
<p>The Count looked profoundly surprised and delighted. 'What! you
are then Lady Georgina Fawley!' he cried, striking an attitude.
'Indeed, miladi, your admirable husband was one of the very first
to exert his influence in my favour at Vienna. Do I recall him,
<i>ce cher</i> Sir Evelyn? If I recall him! What a fortunate
rencounter! I must have seen you some years ago at Vienna, miladi,
though I had not then the great pleasure of making your
acquaintance. But your face had impressed itself on my
sub-conscious self!' (I did not learn till later that the esoteric
doctrine of the sub-conscious self was Lady Georgina's favourite
hobby.) 'The moment chance led me to this carriage this morning, I
said to myself, "That face, those features: so vivid, so striking:
I have seen them somewhere. With what do I connect them in the
recesses of my memory? A high-born family; genius; rank; the
diplomatic service; some unnameable charm; some faint touch of
eccentricity. Ha! I have it. Vienna, a carriage with footmen in red
livery, a noble presence, a crowd of wits&mdash;poets, artists,
politicians&mdash;pressing eagerly round the landau." That was my
mental picture as I sat and confronted you: I understand it all
now; this is Lady Georgina Fawley!'</p>
<p>I thought the Cantankerous Old Lady, who was a shrewd person in
her way, must surely see through this obvious patter; but I had
under-estimated the average human capacity for swallowing flattery.
Instead of dismissing his fulsome<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> nonsense with a
contemptuous smile, Lady Georgina perked herself up with a
conscious air of coquetry, and asked for more. 'Yes, they were
delightful days in Vienna,' she said, simpering; 'I was young then,
Count; I enjoyed life with a zest.'</p>

<span class="caption">PERSONS OF MILADI&#39;S TEMPERAMENT ARE
ALWAYS YOUNG.</span></div>
<p>'Persons of miladi's temperament are always young,' the Count
retorted, glibly, leaning forward and gazing at her. 'Growing old
is a foolish habit of the stupid and the vacant. Men and women of
<i>esprit</i> are never older. One learns as<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> one
goes on in life to admire, not the obvious beauty of mere youth and
health'&mdash;he glanced across at me disdainfully&mdash;'but the
profounder beauty of deep character in a face&mdash;that calm and
serene beauty which is imprinted on the brow by experience of the
emotions.'</p>
<p>'I have had my moments,' Lady Georgina murmured, with her head
on one side.</p>
<p>'I believe it, miladi,' the Count answered, and ogled her.</p>
<p>Thenceforward to Dover, they talked together with ceaseless
animation. The Cantankerous Old Lady was capital company. She had a
tang in her tongue, and in the course of ninety minutes she had
flayed alive the greater part of London society, with keen wit and
sprightliness. I laughed against my will at her ill-tempered
sallies; they were too funny not to amuse, in spite of their
vitriol. As for the Count, he was charmed. He talked well himself,
too, and between them I almost forgot the time till we arrived at
Dover.</p>
<p>It was a very rough passage. The Count helped us to carry our
nineteen hand-packages and four rugs on board; but I noticed that,
fascinated as she was with him, Lady Georgina resisted his
ingenious efforts to gain possession of her precious jewel-case as
she descended the gangway. She clung to it like grim death, even in
the chops of the Channel. Fortunately I am a good sailor, and when
Lady Georgina's sallow cheeks began to grow pale, I was steady
enough to supply her with her shawl and her smelling-bottle. She
fidgeted and worried the whole way over. She <i>would</i> be
treated like a vertebrate animal. Those horrid Belgians had no
right to stick their deck-chairs just in front of her. The
impertinence of the hussies with the bright red hair&mdash;a
grocer's daughters, she felt sure&mdash;in venturing to come and
sit on the same bench with <i>her</i>&mdash;the bench 'for ladies
only,' under the lee of the funnel! 'Ladies only,' indeed!
Did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg
22]</a></span> the baggages pretend they considered themselves
ladies? Oh, that placid old gentleman in the episcopal gaiters was
their father, was he? Well, a bishop should bring up his daughters
better, having his children in subjection with all gravity. Instead
of which&mdash;'Lois, my smelling-salts!' This was a beastly boat;
such an odour of machinery; they had no decent boats nowadays; with
all our boasted improvements, she could remember well when the
cross-Channel service was much better conducted than it was at
present. But <i>that</i> was before we had compulsory education.
The working classes were driving trade out of the country, and the
consequence was, we couldn't build a boat which didn't reek like an
oil-shop. Even the sailors on board were French&mdash;jabbering
idiots; not an honest British Jack-tar among the lot of them;
though the stewards were English, and very inferior Cockney English
at that, with their off-hand ways, and their School Board airs and
graces. <i>She'd</i> School Board them if they were her servants;
<i>she'd</i> show them the sort of respect that was due to people
of birth and education. But the children of the lower classes never
learnt their catechism nowadays; they were too much occupied with
literatoor, jography, and free-'and drawrin'. Happily for my
nerves, a good lurch to leeward put a stop for a while to the
course of her thoughts on the present distresses.</p>
<p>At Ostend the Count made a second gallant attempt to capture the
jewel-case, which Lady Georgina automatically repulsed. She had a
fixed habit, I believe, of sticking fast to that jewel-case; for
she was too overpowered by the Count's urbanity, I feel sure, to
suspect for a moment his honesty of purpose. But whenever she
travelled, I fancy, she clung to her case as if her life depended
upon it; it contained the whole of her valuable
diamonds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg

<p>We had twenty minutes for refreshments at Ostend, during which
interval my old lady declared with warmth that I <i>must</i> look
after her registered luggage; though, as it was booked through to
Cologne, I could not even see it till we crossed the German
frontier; for the Belgian <i>douaniers</i> seal up the van as soon
as the through baggage for Germany is unloaded. To satisfy her,
however, I went through the formality of pretending to inspect it,
and rendered myself hateful to the head of the <i>douane</i> by
asking various foolish and inept questions, on which Lady Georgina
insisted. When I had finished this silly and uncongenial
task&mdash;for I am not by nature fussy, and it is hard to assume
fussiness as another person's proxy&mdash;I returned to our
<i>coup&eacute;</i> which I had arranged for in London. To my great
amazement, I found the Cantankerous Old Lady and the egregious
Count comfortably seated there. 'Monsieur has been good enough to
accept a place in our carriage,' she observed, as I entered.</p>
<p>He bowed and smiled. 'Or, rather, madame has been so kind as to
offer me one,' he corrected.</p>
<p>'Would you like some lunch, Lady Georgina?' I asked, in my
chilliest voice. 'There are ten minutes to spare, and the
<i>buffet</i> is excellent.'</p>
<p>'An admirable inspiration,' the Count murmured. 'Permit me to
escort you, miladi.'</p>
<p>'You will come, Lois?' Lady Georgina asked.</p>
<p>'No, thank you,' I answered, for I had an idea. 'I am a capital
sailor, but the sea takes away my appetite.'</p>
<p>'Then you'll keep our places,' she said, turning to me. 'I hope
you won't allow them to stick in any horrid foreigners! They will
try to force them on you unless you insist. <i>I</i> know their
tricky ways. You have the tickets, I trust? And the <i>bulletin</i>
for the <i>coup&eacute;</i>? Well, mind you don't lose the paper
for the registered luggage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24"
id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> Don't let those dreadful porters
touch my cloaks. And if anybody attempts to get in, be sure you
stand in front of the door as they mount to prevent them.'</p>
<p>The Count handed her out; he was all high courtly politeness. As
Lady Georgina descended, he made yet another dexterous effort to
relieve her of the jewel-case. I don't think she noticed it, but
automatically once more she waved him aside. Then she turned to me.
'Here, my dear,' she said, handing it to me, 'you'd better take
care of it. If I lay it down in the <i>buffet</i> while I am eating
my soup, some rogue may run away with it. But mind,
don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg
25]</a></span> let it out of your hands on any account. Hold it so,
on your knee; and, for Heaven's sake, don't part with it.'</p>

title=""> <span class="caption">THAT SUCCEEDS? THE SHABBY-LOOKING
MAN MUTTERED.</span></div>
<p>By this time my suspicions of the Count were profound. From the
first I had doubted him; he was so blandly plausible. But as we
landed at Ostend I had accidentally overheard a low whispered
conversation when he passed a shabby-looking man, who had travelled
in a second-class carriage from London. 'That succeeds?' the
shabby-looking man had muttered under his breath in French, as the
haughty nobleman with the waxed moustache brushed by him.</p>
<p>'That succeeds admirably,' the Count had answered, in the same
soft undertone. '<i>&Ccedil;a r&eacute;ussit &agrave;
merveille!</i>'</p>
<p>I understood him to mean that he had prospered in his attempt to
impose on Lady Georgina.</p>
<p>They had been gone five minutes at the <i>buffet</i>, when the
Count came back hurriedly to the door of the <i>coup&eacute;</i>
with a <i>nonchalant</i> air. 'Oh, mademoiselle,' he said, in an
off-hand tone, 'Lady Georgina has sent me to fetch her
jewel-case.'</p>
<p>I gripped it hard with both hands. '<i>Pardon</i>, M. le Comte,'
I answered; 'Lady Georgina intrusted it to <i>my</i> safe keeping,
and, without her leave, I cannot give it up to any one.'</p>
<p>'You mistrust me?' he cried, looking black. 'You doubt my
honour? You doubt my word when I say that miladi has sent me?'</p>
<p>'<i>Du tout</i>,' I answered, calmly. 'But I have Lady
Georgina's orders to stick to this case; and till Lady Georgina
returns I stick to it.'</p>
<p>He murmured some indignant remark below his breath, and walked
off. The shabby-looking passenger was pacing up and down the
platform outside in a badly-made dust-coat. As they passed their
lips moved. The Count's seemed to mutter, '<i>C'est un coup
manqu&eacute;.</i>'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id=
"Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p>However, he did not desist even so. I saw he meant to go on with
his dangerous little game. He returned to the <i>buffet</i> and
rejoined Lady Georgina. I felt sure it would be useless to warn
her, so completely had the Count succeeded in gulling her; but I
took my own steps. I examined the jewel-case closely. It had a
leather outer covering; within was a strong steel box, with stout
bands of metal to bind it. I took my cue at once, and acted for the
best on my own responsibility.</p>
<p>When Lady Georgina and the Count returned, they were like old
friends together. The quails in aspic and the sparkling hock had
evidently opened their hearts to one another. As far as Malines
they laughed and talked without ceasing. Lady Georgina was now in
her finest vein of spleen: her acid wit grew sharper and more
caustic each moment. Not a reputation in Europe had a rag left to
cover it as we steamed in beneath the huge iron roof of the main
central junction.</p>
<p>I had observed all the way from Ostend that the Count had been
anxious lest we might have to give up our <i>coup&eacute;</i> at
Malines. I assured him more than once that his fears were
groundless, for I had arranged at Charing Cross that it should run
right through to the German frontier. But he waved me aside, with
one lordly hand. I had not told Lady Georgina of his vain attempt
to take possession of her jewel-case; and the bare fact of my
silence made him increasingly suspicious of me.</p>
<p>'Pardon me, mademoiselle,' he said, coldly; 'you do not
understand these lines as well as I do. Nothing is more common than
for those rascals of railway clerks to sell one a place in a
<i>coup&eacute;</i> or a <i>wagon-lit</i>, and then never reserve
it, or turn one out half way. It is very possible miladi may have
to descend at Malines.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id=
"Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<p>Lady Georgina bore him out by a large variety of selected
stories concerning the various atrocities of the rival companies
which had stolen her luggage on her way to Italy. As for <i>trains
de luxe</i>, they were dens of robbers.</p>
<p>So when we reached Malines, just to satisfy Lady Georgina, I put
out my head and inquired of a porter. As I anticipated, he replied
that there was no change; we went through to Verviers.</p>
<p>The Count, however, was still unsatisfied. He descended, and
made some remarks a little farther down the platform to an official
in the gold-banded cap of a <i>chef-de-gare</i>, or some such
functionary. Then he returned to us, all fuming. 'It is as I said,'
he exclaimed, flinging open the door. 'These rogues have deceived
us. The <i>coup&eacute;</i> goes no farther. You must dismount at
once, miladi, and take the train just opposite.'</p>
<p>I felt sure he was wrong, and I ventured to say so. But Lady
Georgina cried, 'Nonsense, child! The <i>chef-de-gare</i> must
know. Get out at once! Bring my bag and the rugs! Mind that cloak!
Don't forget the sandwich-tin! Thanks, Count; will you kindly take
charge of my umbrellas? Hurry up, Lois; hurry up! the train is just
starting!'</p>
<p>I scrambled after her, with my fourteen bundles, keeping a quiet
eye meanwhile on the jewel-case.</p>
<p>We took our seats in the opposite train, which I noticed was
marked 'Amsterdam, Bruxelles, Paris.' But I said nothing. The Count
jumped in, jumped about, arranged our parcels, jumped out again. He
spoke to a porter; then he rushed back excitedly. '<i>Mille
pardons</i>, miladi,' he cried. 'I find the <i>chef-de-gare</i> has
cruelly deceived me. You were right, after all, mademoiselle! We
must return to the <i>coup&eacute;</i>!'</p>
<p>With singular magnanimity, I refrained from saying, 'I told you
so.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg
28]</a></span></p>
<p>Lady Georgina, very flustered and hot by this time, tumbled out
once more, and bolted back to the <i>coup&eacute;</i>. Both trains
were just starting. In her hurry, at last, she let the Count take
possession of her jewel-case. I rather fancy that as he passed one
window he handed it in to the shabby-looking passenger; but I am
not certain. At any rate, when we were comfortably seated in our
own compartment once more, and he stood on the footboard just about
to enter, of a sudden he made an unexpected dash back, and flung
himself wildly into a Paris carriage. At the self-same moment, with
a piercing shriek, both trains started.</p>
<p>Lady Georgina threw up her hands in a frenzy of horror. 'My
diamonds!' she cried aloud. 'Oh, Lois, my diamonds!'</p>
<p>'Don't distress yourself,' I answered, holding her back, for I
verily believe she would have leapt from the train. 'He has only
taken the outer shell, with the sandwich-case inside it.
<i>Here</i> is the steel box!' And I produced it, triumphantly.</p>
<p>She seized it, overjoyed. 'How did this happen?' she cried,
hugging it, for she loved those diamonds.</p>
<p>'Very simply,' I answered. 'I saw the man was a rogue, and that
he had a confederate with him in another carriage. So, while you
were gone to the <i>buffet</i> at Ostend, I slipped the box out of
the case, and put in the sandwich-tin, that he might carry it off,
and we might have proofs against him. All you have to do now is to
inform the conductor, who will telegraph to stop the train to
Paris. I spoke to him about that at Ostend, so that everything is
ready.'</p>
<p>She positively hugged me. 'My dear,' she cried, 'you are the
cleverest little woman I ever met in my life! Who on earth could
have suspected such a polished gentleman? Why, you're worth your
weight in gold. What the dickens shall I do without you at
Schlangenbad?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id=

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>
<h3>THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUPERCILIOUS <i>ATTACH&Eacute;</i></h3>
<p>The Count must have been an adept in the gentle art of
quick-change disguise; for though we telegraphed full particulars
of his appearance from Louvain, the next station, nobody in the
least resembling either him or his accomplice, the shabby-looking
man, could be unearthed in the Paris train when it drew up at
Brussels, its first stopping-place. They must have transformed
themselves meanwhile into two different persons. Indeed, from the
outset, I had suspected his moustache&mdash;'twas so <i>very</i>
distinguished.</p>
<p>When we reached Cologne, the Cantankerous Old Lady overwhelmed
me with the warmth of her thanks and praises. Nay, more; after
breakfast next morning, before we set out by slow train for
Schlangenbad, she burst like a tornado into my bedroom at the
Cologne hotel with a cheque for twenty guineas, drawn in my favour.
'That's for you, my dear,' she said, handing it to me, and looking
really quite gracious.</p>
<p>I glanced at the piece of paper and felt my face glow crimson.
'Oh, Lady Georgina,' I cried; 'you misunderstand. You forget that I
am a lady.'</p>
<p>'Nonsense, child, nonsense! Your courage and promptitude were
worth ten times that sum,' she exclaimed, positively slipping her
arm round my neck. 'It was your courage I<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
particularly admired, Lois; because you faced the risk of my
happening to look inside the outer case, and finding you had
abstracted the blessed box: in which case I might quite naturally
have concluded you meant to steal it.'</p>
<p>'I thought of that,' I answered. 'But I decided to risk it. I
felt it was worth while. For I was sure the man meant to take the
case as soon as ever you gave him the opportunity.'</p>
<p>'Then you deserve to be rewarded,' she insisted, pressing the
cheque upon me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id=
"Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;"><a name="ILL_009" id=

height="459" alt="I PUT HER HAND BACK FIRMLY." title="">
<span class="caption">I PUT HER HAND BACK FIRMLY.</span></div>
<p>I put her hand back firmly. 'Lady Georgina,' I said, 'it is very
amiable of you. I think you do right in offering me the money; but
I think I should do altogether wrong in accepting it. A lady is not
honest from the hope of gain; she is not brave because she expects
to be paid for her bravery. You were my employer, and I was bound
to serve my employer's interests. I did so as well as I could, and
there is the end of it.'</p>
<p>She looked absolutely disappointed; we all hate to crush a
benevolent impulse; but she tore the cheque up into very small
pieces. 'As you will, my dear,' she said, with her hands on her
hips: 'I see, you are poor Tom Cayley's daughter. He was always a
bit Quixotic.' Though I believe she liked me all the better for my
refusal.</p>
<p>On the way from Cologne to Eltville, however, and on the drive
up to Schlangenbad, I found her just as fussy and as worrying as
ever. 'Let me see, how many of these horrid pfennigs make an
English penny? I never <i>can</i> remember. Oh, those silly little
nickel things are ten pfennigs each, are they? Well, eight would be
a penny, I suppose. A mark's a shilling; ridiculous of them to
divide it into ten pence instead of twelve; one never really knows
how much one's paying for anything. Why these Continental people
can't be content to use pounds, shillings, and pence, all over
alike, the same as we do, passes <i>my</i> comprehension. They're
glad enough to get English sovereigns when they can; why, then,
don't they use them as such, instead of reckoning them each at
twenty-five francs, and then trying to cheat you out of the proper
exchange, which is <i>always</i> ten centimes more than the brokers
give you? What, <i>we</i> use their beastly decimal system? Lois,
I'm ashamed of you. An English girl to turn and rend her native
country like that! Francs and centimes, indeed! Fancy proposing it
at Peter Robinson's!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id=
"Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> No, I will <i>not</i> go by the boat,
my dear. I hate the Rhine boats, crowded with nasty selfish pigs of
Germans. What <i>I</i> like is a first-class compartment all to
myself, and no horrid foreigners. Especially Germans. They're
bursting with self-satisfaction&mdash;have such an exaggerated
belief in their "land" and their "folk." And when they come to
England, they do nothing but find fault with us. If people aren't
satisfied with the countries they travel in, they'd better stop at
home&mdash;that's <i>my</i> opinion. Nasty pigs of Germans! The
very sight of them sickens me. Oh, I don't mind if they <i>do</i>
understand me, child. They all learn English nowadays; it helps
them in trade&mdash;that's why they're driving us out of all the
markets. But it <i>must</i> be good for them to learn once in a way
what other people really think of them&mdash;civilised people, I
mean; not Germans. They're a set of barbarians.'</p>
<p>We reached Schlangenbad alive, though I sometimes doubted it:
for my old lady did her boisterous best to rouse some peppery
German officer into cutting our throats incontinently by the way;
and when we got there, we took up our abode in the nicest hotel in
the village. Lady Georgina had engaged the best front room on the
first floor, with a charming view across the pine-clad valley; but
I must do her the justice to say that she took the second best for
me, and that she treated me in every way like the guest she
delighted to honour. My refusal to accept her twenty guineas made
her anxious to pay it back to me within the terms of our agreement.
She described me to everybody as a young friend who was travelling
with her, and never gave any one the slightest hint of my being a
paid companion. Our arrangement was that I was to have two guineas
for the week, besides my travelling expenses, board, and
lodging.</p>
<p>On our first morning at Schlangenbad, Lady Georgina<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> sallied
forth, very much overdressed, and in a youthful hat, to use the
waters. They are valued chiefly for the complexion, I learned; I
wondered then why Lady Georgina came there&mdash;for she hadn't
any; but they are also recommended for nervous irritability, and as
Lady Georgina had visited the place almost every summer for fifteen
years, it opened before one's mind an appalling vista of what her
temper might have been if she had <i>not</i> gone to Schlangenbad.
The hot springs are used in the form of a bath. '<i>You</i> don't
need them, my dear,' Lady Georgina said to me, with a good-humoured
smile; and I will own that I did not, for nature has gifted me with
a tolerable cuticle. But I like when at Rome to do as Rome does; so
I tried the baths once. I found them unpleasantly smooth and oily.
I do not freckle, but if I did, I think I should prefer
freckles.</p>
<p>We walked much on the terrace&mdash;the inevitable dawdling
promenade of all German watering-places&mdash;it reeked of Serene
Highness. We also drove out among the low wooded hills which bound
the Rhine valley. The majority of the visitors, I found, were
ladies&mdash;Court ladies, most of them; all there for their
complexions, but all anxious to assure me privately they had come
for what they described as 'nervous debility.' I divided them at
once into two classes: half of them never had and never would have
a complexion at all; the other half had exceptionally smooth and
beautiful skins, of which they were obviously proud, and whose
pink-and-white peach-blossom they thought to preserve by assiduous
bathing. It was vanity working on two opposite bases. There was a
sprinkling of men, however, who were really there for a sufficient
reason&mdash;wounds or serious complaints; while a few good old
sticks, porty and whisty, were in attendance on invalid wives or
sisters.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 329px;"><a name="ILL_010" id=

height="500" alt="HE CAST A HASTY GLANCE AT US." title="">
<span class="caption">HE CAST A HASTY GLANCE AT US.</span></div>
<p>From the beginning I noticed that Lady Georgina went<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> peering
about all over the place, as if she were hunting for something she
had lost, with her long-handled tortoise-shell glasses perpetually
in evidence&mdash;the 'aristocratic outrage' I called
them&mdash;and that she eyed all the men with peculiar attention.
But I took no open notice of her little weakness. On our second day
at the Spa, I was sauntering with her down the chief
street&mdash;'a beastly little hole, my dear; not a decent shop
where one can buy a reel of thread or a yard of tape in the
place!'&mdash;when I observed a tall and handsome young man on the
opposite side of the road cast a hasty glance at us, and then sneak
round the corner hurriedly. He was a loose-limbed, languid-looking
young man, with large, dreamy eyes, and a peculiarly beautiful and
gentle expression; but what I noted about him most was an odd
superficial air of superciliousness. He seemed always to be looking
down with scorn on that foolish jumble, the universe. He darted
away so rapidly, however, that I hardly discovered all this just
then. I piece it out from subsequent observations.</p>
<p>Later in the day, we chanced to pass a <i>caf&eacute;</i>, where
three young exquisites sat sipping Rhine wines after the fashion of
the country. One of them, with a gold-tipped cigarette held
gracefully between two slender fingers, was my languid-looking
young aristocrat. He was blowing out smoke in a lazy blue stream.
The moment he saw me, however, he turned away as if he desired to
escape observation, and ducked down so as to hide his face behind
his companions. I wondered why on earth he should want to avoid me.
Could this be the Count? No, the young man with the halo of
cigarette smoke stood three inches taller. Who, then, at
Schlangenbad could wish to avoid my notice? It was a singular
mystery; for I was quite certain the supercilious young man was
trying his best to prevent my seeing him.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>
<p>That evening, after dinner, the Cantankerous Old Lady burst out
suddenly, 'Well, I can't for the life of me imagine<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> why
Harold hasn't turned up here. The wretch knew I was coming; and I
heard from our Ambassador at Rome last week that he was going to be
at Schlangenbad.'</p>
<p>'Who is Harold?' I asked.</p>
<p>'My nephew,' Lady Georgina snapped back, beating a devil's
tattoo with her fan on the table. 'The only member of my family,
except myself, who isn't a born idiot. Harold's not an idiot; he's
an <i>attach&eacute;</i> at Rome.'</p>
<p>I saw it at a glance. 'Then he <i>is</i> in Schlangenbad,' I
answered. 'I noticed him this morning.'</p>
<p>The old lady turned towards me sharply. She peered right through
me, as if she were a R&ouml;ntgen ray. I could see she was asking
herself whether this was a conspiracy, and whether I had come there
on purpose to meet 'Harold.' But I flatter myself I am tolerably
mistress of my own countenance. I did not blench. 'How do you
know?' she asked quickly, with an acid intonation.</p>
<p>If I had answered the truth, I should have said, 'I know he is
here, because I saw a good-looking young man evidently trying to
avoid you this morning; and if a young man has the misfortune to be
born your nephew, and also to have expectations from you, it is
easy to understand that he would prefer to keep out of your way as
long as possible.' But that would have been neither polite nor
politic. Moreover, I reflected that I had no particular reason for
wishing to do Mr. Harold a bad turn; and that it would be kinder to
him, as well as to her, to conceal the reasons on which I based my
instinctive inference. So I took up a strong strategic position. 'I
have an intuition that I saw him in the village this morning,' I
said. 'Family likeness, perhaps. I merely jumped at it as you
spoke. A tall, languid young man; large, poetical eyes; an artistic
moustache&mdash;just a trifle Oriental-looking.'<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg
38]</a></span></p>
<p>'That's Harold!' the Cantankerous Old Lady rapped out sharply,
with clear conviction. 'The miserable boy! Why on earth hasn't he
been round to see me?'</p>
<p>I reflected that I knew why; but I did not say so. Silence is
golden. I also remarked mentally on that curious human blindness
which had made me conclude at first that the supercilious young man
was trying to avoid <i>me</i>, when I might have guessed it was far
more likely he was trying to avoid my companion. I was a nobody;
Lady Georgina Fawley was a woman of European reputation.</p>
<p>'Perhaps he didn't know which hotel you were stopping at,' I put
in. 'Or even that you were here.' I felt a sudden desire to shield
poor Harold.</p>
<p>'Not know which hotel? Nonsense, child; he knows I come here on
this precise date regularly every summer; and if he didn't know, is
it likely I should try any other inn, when this is the only
moderately decent house to stop at in Schlangenbad? And the morning
coffee undrinkable at that; while the hash&mdash;<i>such</i> hash!
But that's the way in Germany. He's an ungrateful monster; if he
comes now, I shall refuse to see him.'</p>

<p>Next morning after breakfast, however, in spite of these
threats, she hailed me forth with her on the Harold hunt. She had
sent the <i>concierge</i> to inquire at all the hotels already, it
seemed, and found her truant at none of them; now she ransacked the
<i>pensions</i>. At last she hunted him down in a house on the
hill. I could see she was really hurt. 'Harold, you viper, what do
you mean by trying to avoid me?'</p>
<p>'My dear aunt, <i>you</i> here in Schlangenbad! Why, when did
you arrive? And what a colour you've got! You're looking <i>so</i>
well!' That clever thrust saved him.</p>
<p>He cast me an appealing glance. 'You will not betray me?' it
said. I answered, mutely, 'Not for worlds,' with a faltering pair
of downcast eyelids.</p>
<p>'Oh, I'm <i>well</i> enough, thank you,' Lady
Georgina<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg
39]</a></span> replied, somewhat mollified by his astute allusion
to her personal appearance. He had hit her weak point dexterously.
'As well, that is, as one can expect to be nowadays. Hereditary
gout&mdash;the sins of the fathers visited as usual. But why didn't
you come to see me?'</p>
<p>'How can I come to see you if you don't tell me where you are?
"Lady Georgina Fawley, Europe," was the only address I knew. It
strikes me as insufficient.'</p>
<p>His gentle drawl was a capital foil to Lady Georgina's acidulous
soprano. It seemed to disarm her. She turned to me with a benignant
wave of her hand. 'Miss Cayley,' she said, introducing me; 'my
nephew, Mr. Harold Tillington. You've heard me talk of poor Tom
Cayley, Harold? This is poor Tom Cayley's daughter.'</p>
<p>'Indeed?' the supercilious <i>attach&eacute;</i> put in, looking
hard at me. 'Delighted to make Miss Cayley's acquaintance.'</p>
<p>'Now, Harold, I can tell from your voice at once you haven't
remembered one word about Captain Cayley.'</p>
<p>Harold stood on the defensive. 'My dear aunt,' he observed,
expanding both palms, 'I have heard you talk of so <i>very</i> many
people, that even <i>my</i> diplomatic memory fails at times to
recollect them all. But I do better: I dissemble. I will plead
forgetfulness now of Captain Cayley, since you force it on me. It
is not likely I shall have to plead it of Captain Cayley's
daughter.' And he bowed towards me gallantly.</p>
<p>The Cantankerous Old Lady darted a lightning glance at him. It
was a glance of quick suspicion. Then she turned her R&ouml;ntgen
rays upon my face once more. I fear I burned crimson.</p>
<p>'A friend?' he asked. 'Or a fellow-guest?'</p>
<p>'A companion.' It was the first nasty thing she had said of
me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg
40]</a></span></p>
<p>'Ha! more than a friend, then. A comrade.' He turned the edge
neatly.</p>
<p>We walked out on the terrace and a little way up the zigzag
path. The day was superb. I found Mr. Tillington, in spite of his
studiously languid and supercilious air, a most agreeable
companion. He knew Europe. He was full of talk of Rome and the
Romans. He had epigrammatic wit, curt, keen, and pointed. We sat
down on a bench; he kept Lady Georgina and myself amused for an
hour by his crisp sallies. Besides, he had been everywhere and seen
everybody. Culture and agriculture seemed all one to him.</p>
<p>When we rose to go in, Lady Georgina remarked, with emphasis,
'Of course, Harold, you'll come and take up your diggings at our
hotel?'</p>
<p>'Of course, my dear aunt. How can you ask? Free quarters.
Nothing would give me greater pleasure.'</p>
<p>She glanced at him keenly again. I saw she had expected him to
fake up some lame excuse for not joining us; and I fancied she was
annoyed at his prompt acquiescence, which had done her out of the
chance for a family disagreement. 'Oh, you'll come then?' she said,
grudgingly.</p>
<p>'Certainly, most respected aunt. I shall much prefer it.'</p>
<p>She let her piercing eye descend upon me once more. I was aware
that I had been talking with frank ease of manner to Mr.
Tillington, and that I had said several things which clearly amused
him. Then I remembered all at once our relative positions. A
companion, I felt, should know her place: it is not her
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> to be smart and amusing. 'Perhaps,' I said,
drawing back, 'Mr. Tillington would like to remain in his present
quarters till the end of the week, while I am with you, Lady
Georgina; after that, he could have my room; it might be more
convenient.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id=
"Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>
<p>His eye caught mine quickly. 'Oh, you're only going to stop a
week, then, Miss Cayley?' he put in, with an air of
disappointment.</p>
<p>'Only a week,' I nodded.</p>
<p>'My dear child,' the Cantankerous Old Lady broke out, 'what
nonsense you do talk! Only going to stop a week? How can I exist
without you?'</p>
<p>'That was the arrangement,' I said, mischievously. 'You were
going to look about, you recollect, for an unsophisticated
Gretchen. You don't happen to know of any warehouse where a supply
of unsophisticated Gretchens is kept constantly in stock, do you,
Mr. Tillington?'</p>
<p>'No, I don't,' he answered, laughing. 'I believe there are dodos
and auks' eggs, in very small numbers, still to be procured in the
proper quarters; but the unsophisticated Gretchen, I am credibly
informed, is an extinct animal. Why, the cap of one fetches high
prices nowadays among collectors.'</p>
<p>'But you will come to the hotel at once, Harold?' Lady Georgina
interposed.</p>
<p>'Certainly, aunt. I will move in without delay. If Miss Cayley
is going to stay for a single week only, that adds one extra
inducement for joining you immediately.'</p>
<p>His aunt's stony eye was cold as marble.</p>
<p>So when we got back to our hotel after the baths that afternoon,
the <i>concierge</i> greeted us with: 'Well, your noble nephew has
arrived, high-well-born countess! He came with his boxes just now,
and has taken a room near your honourable ladyship's.'</p>
<p>Lady Georgina's face was a study of mingled emotions. I don't
know whether she looked more pleased or jealous.</p>
<p>Later in the day, I chanced on Mr. Tillington, sunning himself
on a bench in the hotel garden. He rose, and<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> came up
to me, as fast as his languid nature permitted. 'Oh, Miss Cayley,'
he said, abruptly, 'I do want to thank you so much for not
betraying me. I know you spotted me twice in the town yesterday;
and I also know you were good enough to say nothing to my revered
aunt about it.'</p>
<p>'I had no reason for wishing to hurt Lady Georgina's feelings,'
I answered, with a permissible evasion.</p>
<p>His countenance fell. 'I never thought of that,' he interposed,
with one hand on his moustache. 'I&mdash; I fancied you did it out
of fellow-feeling.'</p>
<p>'We all think of things mainly from our own point of view
first,' I answered. 'The difference is that some of us think of
them from other people's afterwards. Motives are mixed.'</p>
<p>He smiled. 'I didn't know my deeply venerated relative was
coming here so soon,' he went on. 'I thought she wasn't expected
till next week; my brother wrote me that she had quarrelled with
her French maid, and 'twould take her full ten days to get another.
I meant to clear out before she arrived. To tell you the truth, I
was going to-morrow.'</p>
<p>'And now you are stopping on?'</p>
<p>He caught my eye again.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 358px;"><a name="ILL_012" id=

height="500" alt="CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER CASES, HE MURMURED." title=
""> <span class="caption">CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER CASES, HE
MURMURED.</span></div>
<p>'Circumstances alter cases,' he murmured, with meaning.</p>
<p>'It is hardly polite to describe one as a circumstance,' I
objected.</p>
<p>'I meant,' he said, quickly, 'my aunt alone is one thing; my
aunt with a friend is quite another.'</p>
<p>'I see,' I answered. 'There is safety in numbers.'</p>
<p>He eyed me hard.</p>
<p>'Are you medi&aelig;val or modern?' he asked.</p>
<p>'Modern, I hope,' I replied. Then I looked at him again.
'Oxford?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg
43]</a></span></p>
<p>He nodded. 'And you?' half joking.</p>
<p>'Cambridge,' I said, glad to catch him out. 'What college?'</p>
<p>'Merton. Yours?'</p>
<p>'Girton.'</p>
<p>The odd rhyme amused him. Thenceforth we were<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
friends&mdash;'two 'Varsity men,' he said. And indeed it does make
a queer sort of link&mdash;a freemasonry to which even women are
now admitted.</p>
<p>At dinner and through the evening he talked a great deal to me,
Lady Georgina putting in from time to time a characteristic growl
about the <i>table-d'h&ocirc;te</i> chicken&mdash;'a special breed,
my dear, with eight drumsticks apiece'&mdash;or about the
inadequate lighting of the heavy German <i>salon</i>. She was worse
than ever: pungent as a rule, that evening she was grumpy. When we
retired for the night, to my great surprise, she walked into my
bedroom. She seated herself on my bed: I saw she had come to talk
over Harold.</p>
<p>'He will be very rich, my dear, you know. A great catch in time.
He will inherit all my brother's money.'</p>
<p>'Lord Kynaston's?'</p>
<p>'Bless the child, no. Kynaston's as poor as a church mouse with
the tithes unpaid; he has three sons of his own, and not a blessed
stiver to leave between them. How could he, poor dear idiot?
Agricultural depression; a splendid pauper. He has only the estate,
and that's in Essex; land going begging; worth nothing a year,
encumbered up to the eyes, and loaded with first rent-charges,
jointures, settlements. Money, indeed! poor Kynaston! It's my
brother Marmaduke's I mean; lucky dog, <i>he</i> went in for
speculation&mdash;began life as a guinea-pig, and rose with the
rise of soap and cocoa. He's worth his half-million.'</p>
<p>'Oh, Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst'</p>
<p>Lady Georgina nodded. 'Marmy's a fool,' she said, briefly; 'but
he knows which side of his bread is buttered.'</p>
<p>'And Mr. Tillington is&mdash;his nephew?'</p>
<p>'Bless the child, yes; have you never read your British Bible,
the peerage? Astonishing, the ignorance of these Girton girls! They
don't even know the Leger's run at<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> Doncaster. The family
name's Ashurst. Kynaston's an earl&mdash; I was Lady Georgina
Ashurst before I took it into my head to marry and do for poor
Evelyn Fawley. My younger brother's the Honourable Marmaduke
Ashurst&mdash;women get the best of it there&mdash;it's about the
only place where they do get the best of it: an earl's daughter is
Lady Betty; his son's nothing more than the Honourable Tom. So one
scores off one's brothers. My younger sister, Lady Guinevere
Ashurst, married Stanley Tillington of the Foreign Office. Harold's
their eldest son. Now, child, do you grasp it?'</p>
<p>'Perfectly,' I answered. 'You speak like Debrett. Has issue,
Harold.'</p>
<p>'And Harold will inherit all Marmaduke's money. What I'm always
afraid of is that some fascinating adventuress will try to marry
him out of hand. A pretty face, and over goes Harold! <i>My</i>
business in life is to stand in the way and prevent it.'</p>
<p>She looked me through and through again with her X-ray
scrutiny.</p>
<p>'I don't think Mr. Tillington is quite the sort that falls a
prey to adventuresses,' I answered, boldly.</p>
<p>'Ah, but there are faggots and faggots,' the old lady said,
wagging her head with profound meaning. 'Never mind, though;
<i>I'd</i> like to see an adventuress marry off Harold without my
leave! <i>I'd</i> lead her a life! I'd turn her black hair gray for
her!'</p>
<p>'I should think,' I assented, 'you could do it, Lady Georgina,
if you gave your attention seriously to it.'</p>
<p>From that moment forth, I was aware that my Cantankerous Old
Lady's malign eye was inexorably fixed upon me every time I went
within speaking distance of Mr. Tillington. She watched him like a
lynx. She watched <i>me</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46"
id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> like a dozen lynxes. Wherever we
went, Lady Georgina was sure to turn up in the neighbourhood. She
was perfectly ubiquitous: she seemed to possess a world-wide
circulation. I don't know whether it was this constant suggestion
of hers that I was stalking her nephew which roused my latent human
feeling of opposition; but in the end, I began to be aware that I
rather liked the supercilious <i>attach&eacute;</i> than otherwise.
He evidently liked me, and he tried to meet me. Whenever he spoke
to me, indeed, it was without the superciliousness which marked his
manner towards others; in point of fact, it was with graceful
deference. He watched for me on the stairs, in the garden, by the
terrace; whenever he got a chance, he sidled over and talked to me.
Sometimes he stopped in to read me Heine: he also introduced me to
select portions of Gabriele d'Annunzio. It is feminine to be
touched by such obvious attention; I confess, before long, I grew
to like Mr. Harold Tillington.</p>
<p>The closer he followed me up, the more did I perceive that Lady
Georgina threw out acrid hints with increasing spleen about the
ways of adventuresses. They were hints of that acrimonious
generalised kind, too, which one cannot answer back without seeming
to admit that the cap has fitted. It was atrocious how middle-class
young women nowadays ran after young men of birth and fortune. A
girl would stoop to anything in order to catch five hundred
thousand. Guileless youths should be thrown among their natural
equals. It was a mistake to let them see too much of people of a
lower rank who consider themselves good-looking. And the clever
ones were the worst: they pretended to go in for intellectual
companionship.</p>
<p>I also noticed that though at first Lady Georgina had expressed
the strongest disinclination to my leaving her after the time
originally proposed, she now began to take for<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> granted
that I would go at the end of my week, as arranged in London, and
she even went on to some overt steps towards securing the help of
the blameless Gretchen.</p>
<p>We had arrived at Schlangenbad on Tuesday. I was to stop with
the Cantankerous Old Lady till the corresponding day of the
following week. On the Sunday, I wandered out on the wooded
hillside behind the village; and as I mounted the path I was dimly
aware by a sort of instinct that Harold Tillington was following
me.</p>
<p>He came up with me at last near a ledge of rock. 'How fast you
walk!' he exclaimed. 'I gave you only a few minutes' start, and yet
even my long legs have had hard work to overtake you.'</p>
<p>'I am a fairly good climber,' I answered, sitting down on a
little wooden bench. 'You see, at Cambridge, I went on the river a
great deal&mdash; I canoed and sculled: and then, besides, I've
done a lot of bicycling.'</p>
<p>'What a splendid birthright it is,' he cried, 'to be a wholesome
athletic English girl! You can't think how one admires English
girls after living a year or two in Italy&mdash;where women are
dolls, except for a brief period of intrigue, before they settle
down to be contented frumps with an outline like a barrel.'</p>
<p>'A little muscle and a little mind are no doubt advisable
adjuncts for a housewife,' I admitted.</p>
<p>'You shall not say that word,' he cried, seating himself at my
side. 'It is a word for Germans, "housewife." Our English ideal is
something immeasurably higher and better. A companion, a
complement! Do you know, Miss Cayley, it always sickens me when I
hear German students sentimentalising over their
<i>m&auml;dchen</i>: their beautiful, pure, insipid, yellow-haired,
blue-eyed <i>m&auml;dchen</i>; her, so fair, so innocent, so
unapproachably vacuous&mdash;so like a wax doll&mdash;and
then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg
48]</a></span> think of how they design her in days to come to cook
sausages for their dinner, and knit them endless stockings through
a placid middle age, till the needles drop from her paralysed
fingers, and she retires into frilled caps and Teutonic
senility.'</p>
<p>'You seem to have almost as low an opinion of foreigners as your
respected aunt!' I exclaimed, looking quizzically at him.</p>
<p>He drew back, surprised. 'Oh, no; I'm not narrow-minded, like my
aunt, I hope,' he answered. 'I am a good cosmopolitan. I allow
Continental nations all their own good points, and each has many.
But their women, Miss Cayley&mdash;and their point of view of their
women&mdash;you will admit that there they can't hold a candle to
English women.'</p>
<p>I drew a circle in the dust with the tip of my parasol.</p>
<p>'On that issue, I may not be a wholly unprejudiced observer,' I
answered. 'The fact of my being myself an Englishwoman may possibly
to some extent influence my judgment.'</p>
<p>'You are sarcastic,' he cried, drawing away.</p>
<p>'Not at all,' I answered, making a wider circle. 'I spoke a
simple fact. But what is <i>your</i> ideal, then, as opposed to the
German one?'</p>
<p>He gazed at me and hesitated. His lips half parted. 'My ideal?'
he said, after a pause. 'Well, <i>my</i> ideal&mdash;do you happen
to have such a thing as a pocket-mirror about you?'</p>
<p>I laughed in spite of myself. 'Now, Mr. Tillington,' I said
severely, 'if you're going to pay compliments, I shall have to
return. If you want to stop here with me, you must remember that I
am only Lady Georgina Fawley's temporary lady's-maid. Besides, I
didn't mean that. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id=
"Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> meant, what is your ideal of a man's
right relation to his <i>m&auml;dchen</i>?'</p>
<p>'Don't say <i>m&auml;dchen</i>,' he cried, petulantly. 'It
sounds as if you thought me one of those sentimental Germans. I
hate sentiment.'</p>
<p>'Then, towards the woman of his choice.'</p>
<p>He glanced up through the trees at the light overhead, and spoke
more slowly than ever. 'I think,' he said, fumbling his watch-chain
nervously, 'a man ought to wish the woman he loves to be a free
agent, his equal in point of action, even as she is nobler and
better than he in all spiritual matters. I think he ought to desire
for her a life as high as she is capable of leading, with full
scope for every faculty of her intellect or her emotional nature.
She should be beautiful, with a vigorous, wholesome, many-sided
beauty, moral, intellectual, physical; yet with soul in her, too;
and with the soul and the mind lighting up her eyes, as it lights
up&mdash;well, that is immaterial. And if a man can discover such a
woman as that, and can induce her to believe in him, to love him,
to accept him&mdash;though how such a woman can be satisfied with
any man at all is to me unfathomable&mdash;well, then, I think he
should be happy in devoting his whole life to her, and should give
himself up to repay her condescension in taking him.'</p>
<p>'And you hate sentiment!' I put in, smiling.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 441px;"><a name="ILL_013" id=

title=""> <span class="caption">MISS CAYLEY, HE SAID, YOU ARE
PLAYING WITH ME.</span></div>
<p>He brought his eyes back from the sky suddenly. 'Miss Cayley,'
he said, 'this is cruel. I was in earnest. You are playing with
me.'</p>
<p>'I believe the chief characteristic of the English girl is
supposed to be common sense,' I answered, calmly, 'and I trust I
possess it.' But indeed, as he spoke, my heart was beginning to
make its beat felt; for he was a charming young man; he had a soft
voice and lustrous eyes; it was a<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> summer's day; and alone
in the woods with one other person, where the sunlight falls mellow
in spots like a leopard's skin, one is apt to remember that we are
all human.</p>
<p>That evening Lady Georgina managed to blurt out more malicious
things than ever about the ways of adventuresses,<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> and the
duty of relations in saving young men from the clever clutches of
designing creatures. She was ruthless in her rancour: her gibes
stung me.</p>
<p>On Monday at breakfast I asked her casually if she had yet found
a Gretchen.</p>
<p>'No,' she answered, in a gloomy voice. 'All slatterns, my dear;
all slatterns! Brought up in pig-sties. I wouldn't let one of them
touch my hair for thousands.'</p>
<p>'That's unfortunate,' I said, drily, 'for you know I'm going
to-morrow.'</p>
<p>If I had dropped a bomb in their midst they couldn't have looked
more astonished. 'To-morrow?' Lady Georgina gasped, clutching my
arm. 'You don't mean it, child; you don't mean it?'</p>
<p>I asserted my Ego. 'Certainly,' I answered, with my coolest air.
'I said I thought I could manage you for a week; and I have managed
you.'</p>
<p>She almost burst into tears. 'But, my child, my child, what
shall I do without you?'</p>
<p>'The unsophisticated Gretchen,' I answered, trying not to look
concerned; for in my heart of hearts, in spite of her innuendoes, I
had really grown rather to like the Cantankerous Old Lady.</p>
<p>She rose hastily from the table, and darted up to her own room.
'Lois,' she said, as she rose, in a curious voice of mingled regret
and suspicion, 'I will talk to you about this later.' I could see
she was not quite satisfied in her own mind whether Harold
Tillington and I had not arranged this <i>coup</i> together.</p>
<p>I put on my hat and strolled off into the garden, and then along
the mossy hill path. In a minute more, Harold Tillington was beside
me.</p>
<p>He seated me, half against my will, on a rustic
bench.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg
52]</a></span> 'Look here, Miss Cayley,' he said, with a very
earnest face; 'is this really true? Are you going to-morrow?'</p>
<p>My voice trembled a little. 'Yes,' I answered, biting my lip. 'I
am going. I see several reasons why I should go, Mr.
Tillington.'</p>
<p>'But so soon?'</p>
<p>'Yes, I think so; the sooner the better.' My heart was racing
now, and his eyes pleaded mutely.</p>
<p>'Then where are you going?'</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders, and pouted my lips a little. 'I don't
know,' I replied. 'The world is all before me where to choose. I am
an adventuress,' I said it boldly, 'and I am in quest of
adventures. I really have not yet given a thought to my next place
of sojourn.'</p>
<p>'But you will let me know when you have decided?'</p>
<p>It was time to speak out. 'No, Mr. Tillington,' I said, with
decision. 'I will <i>not</i> let you know. One of my reasons for
going is, that I think I had better see no more of you.'</p>
<p>He flung himself on the bench at my side, and folded his hands
in a helpless attitude. 'But, Miss Cayley,' he cried, 'this is so
short a notice; you give a fellow no chance; I hoped I might have
seen more of you&mdash;might have had some opportunity of&mdash;of
letting you realise how deeply I admired and respected
you&mdash;some opportunity of showing myself as I really am to
you&mdash;before&mdash;before&mdash;&mdash;' he paused, and looked
hard at me.</p>
<p>I did not know what to say. I really liked him so much; and when
he spoke in that voice, I could not bear to seem cruel to him.
Indeed, I was aware at the moment how much I had grown to care for
him in those six short days. But I knew it was impossible. 'Don't
say it, Mr. Tillington,' I murmured, turning my face away. 'The
less said, the sooner mended.'<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 254px;"><a name="ILL_014" id=

height="500" alt="I ROSE OF A SUDDEN, AND RAN DOWN THE HILL."
title=""> <span class="caption">I ROSE OF A SUDDEN, AND RAN DOWN
THE HILL.</span></div>
<p>'But I must,' he cried. 'I must tell you now, if I am to have no
chance afterwards. I wanted you to see more of me before I ventured
to ask you if you could ever love me, if you could ever suffer me
to go through life with you, to share my all with you.' He seized
my trembling hand. 'Lois,' he cried, in a pleading voice, 'I
<i>must</i> ask you; I can't expect you to answer me now, but
<i>do</i> say you will give me at least some other chance of seeing
you, and then, in time, of pressing my suit upon you.'</p>
<p>Tears stood in my eyes. He was so earnest, so charming. But I
remembered Lady Georgina, and his prospective half-million. I moved
his hand away gently. 'I cannot,' I said. 'I cannot&mdash; I am a
penniless girl&mdash;an adventuress. Your family, your uncle, would
never forgive you if you married me. I will not stand in your way.
I&mdash; I like you very much, though I have seen so little of you.
But I feel it is impossible&mdash;and I am going to-morrow.'</p>
<p>Then I rose of a sudden, and ran down the hill with all my
might, lest I should break my resolve, never stopping once till I
reached my own bedroom.</p>
<p>An hour later, Lady Georgina burst in upon me in high dudgeon.
'Why, Lois, my child,' she cried. 'What's this? What on earth does
it mean? Harold tells me he has proposed to you&mdash;proposed to
you&mdash;and you've rejected him!'</p>
<p>I dried my eyes and tried to look steadily at her. 'Yes, Lady
Georgina,' I faltered. 'You need not be afraid. I have refused him;
and I mean it.'</p>
<p>She looked at me, all aghast. '<i>And</i> you mean it!' she
repeated. 'You mean to refuse him. Then, all I can say is, Lois
Cayley, I call it pure cheek of you!'</p>
<p>'What?' I cried, drawing back.</p>
<p>'Yes, cheek,' she answered, volubly. 'Forty thousand<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg
55]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id=
"Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> a year, and a good old family! Harold
Tillington is my nephew; he's an earl's grandson; he's an
<i>attach&eacute;</i> at Rome; and he's bound to be one of the
richest commoners in England. Who are you, I'd like to know, miss,
that you dare to reject him?'</p>
<p>I stared at her, amazed. 'But, Lady Georgina,' I cried, 'you
said you wished to protect your nephew against bare-faced
adventuresses who were setting their caps at him.'</p>
<p>She fixed her eyes on me, half-angry, half-tremulous.</p>
<p>'Of course,' she answered, with withering scorn. 'But,
<i>then</i>, I thought you were trying to catch him. He tells me
now you won't have him, and you won't tell him where you are going.
I call it sheer insolence. Where do you hail from, girl, that you
should refuse my nephew? A man that any woman in England would be
proud to marry! Forty thousand a year, and an earl's grandson!
That's what comes, I suppose, of going to Girton!'</p>
<p>I drew myself up. 'Lady Georgina,' I said, coldly, 'I cannot
allow you to use such language to me. I promised to accompany you
to Germany for a week; and I have kept my word. I like your nephew;
I respect your nephew; he has behaved like a gentleman. But I will
<i>not</i> marry him. Your own conduct showed me in the plainest
way that you did not judge such a match desirable for him; and I
have common sense enough to see that you were quite right. I am a
lady by birth and education; I am an officer's daughter; but I am
not what society calls "a good match" for Mr. Tillington. He had
better marry into a rich stockbroker's family.'</p>
<p>It was an unworthy taunt: the moment it escaped my lips I
regretted it.</p>

<span class="caption">I WAS GOING TO OPPOSE YOU AND
HAROLD.</span></div>
<p>To my intense surprise, however, Lady Georgina flung herself on
my bed, and burst into tears. 'My dear,' she<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> sobbed
out, covering her face with her hands, 'I thought you would be sure
to set your cap at Harold; and after<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> I had seen you for
twenty-four hours, I said to myself, "That's just the sort of girl
Harold ought to fall in love with." I felt sure he would fall in
love with you. I brought you here on purpose. I saw you had all the
qualities that would strike Harold's fancy. So I had made up my
mind for a delightful regulation family quarrel. I was going to
oppose you and Harold, tooth and nail; I was going to threaten that
Marmy would leave his money to Kynaston's eldest son; I was going
to kick up, oh, a dickens of a row about it! Then, of course, in
the end, we should all have been reconciled; we should have kissed
and made friends: for you're just the one girl in the world for
Harold; indeed, I never met anybody so capable and so intelligent.
And now you spoil all my sport by going and refusing him! It's
really most ill-timed of you. And Harold has sent me
here&mdash;he's trembling with anxiety&mdash;to see whether I can't
induce you to think better of your decision.'</p>
<p>I made up my mind at once. 'No, Lady Georgina,' I said, in my
gentlest voice&mdash;positively stooping down and kissing her. 'I
like Mr. Tillington very much. I dare not tell you how much I like
him. He is a dear, good, kind fellow. But I cannot rest under the
cruel imputation of being moved by his wealth and having tried to
capture him. Even if <i>you</i> didn't think so, his family would.
I am sorry to go; for in a way I like you. But it is best to adhere
to our original plan. If <i>I</i> changed my mind, <i>you</i> might
change yours again. Let us say no more. I will go to-morrow.'</p>
<p>'But you will see Harold again?'</p>
<p>'Not alone. Only at dinner.' For I feared lest, if he spoke to
me alone, he might over-persuade me.</p>
<p>'Then at least you will tell him where you are
going?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg
58]</a></span></p>
<p>'No, Lady Georgina; I do not know myself. And besides, it is
best that this should now be final.'</p>
<p>She flung herself upon me. 'But, my dear child, a lady can't go
out into the world with only two pounds in pocket. You <i>must</i>
let me lend you something.'</p>
<p>I unwound her clasping hands. 'No, dear Lady Georgina,' I said,
though I was loth to say it. 'You are very sweet and good, but I
must work out my life in my own way. I have started to work it out,
and I won't be turned aside just here on the threshold.'</p>
<p>'And you won't stop with me?' she cried, opening her arms. 'You
think me too cantankerous?'</p>
<p>'I think you have a dear, kind old heart,' I said, 'under the
quaintest and crustiest outside such a heart ever wore; you're a
truculent old darling: so that's the plain truth of it.'</p>
<p>She kissed me. I kissed her in return with fervour, though I am
but a poor hand at kissing, for a woman. 'So now this episode is
concluded,' I murmured.</p>
<p>'I don't know about that,' she said, drying her eyes. 'I have
set my heart upon you now; and Harold has set his heart upon you;
and considering that your own heart goes much the same way, I
daresay, my dear, we shall find in the end some convenient road out
of it.'</p>
<p>Nevertheless, next morning I set out by myself in the coach from
Schlangenbad. I went forth into the world to live my own life,
partly because it was just then so fashionable, but mainly because
fate had denied me the chance of living anybody else's.<span class=

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>
<h3>THE ADVENTURE OF THE INQUISITIVE AMERICAN</h3>
<p>In one week I had multiplied my capital two hundred and
forty-fold! I left London with twopence in the world; I quitted
Schlangenbad with two pounds in pocket.</p>
<p>'There's a splendid turn-over!' I thought to myself. 'If this
luck holds, at the same rate, I shall have made four hundred and
eighty pounds by Tuesday next, and I may look forward to being a
Barney Barnato by Christmas.' For I had taken high mathematical
honours at Cambridge, and if there is anything on earth on which I
pride myself, it is my firm grasp of the principle of ratios.</p>
<p>Still, in spite of this brilliant financial prospect, a budding
Klondike, I went away from the little Spa on the flanks of the
Taunus with a heavy heart. I had grown quite to like dear,
virulent, fidgety old Lady Georgina; and I felt that it had cost me
a distinct wrench to part with Harold Tillington. The wrench left a
scar which was long in healing; but as I am not a professional
sentimentalist, I will not trouble you here with details of the
symptoms.</p>
<p>My livelihood, however, was now assured me. With two pounds in
pocket, a sensible girl can read her title clear to six days' board
and lodging, at six marks a day, with a glorious margin of four
marks over for pocket-money. And<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> if at the end of six days
my fairy godmother had not pointed me out some other means of
earning my bread honestly&mdash;well, I should feel myself unworthy
to be ranked in the noble army of adventuresses. I thank thee, Lady
Georgina, for teaching me that word. An adventuress I would be; for
I loved adventure.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it occurred to me that I might fill up the interval
by going to study art at Frankfort. Elsie Petheridge had been
there, and had impressed upon me the fact that I must on no account
omit to see the St&auml;del Gallery. She was strong on culture.
Besides, the study of art should be most useful to an adventuress;
for she must need all the arts that human skill has developed.</p>
<p>So to Frankfort I betook myself, and found there a nice little
<i>pension</i>&mdash;'for ladies only,' Frau Bockenheifner assured
me&mdash;at very moderate rates, in a pleasant part of the
Lindenstrasse. It had dimity curtains. I will not deny that as I
entered the house I was conscious of feeling lonely; my heart sank
once or twice as I glanced round the luncheon-table at the
domestically-unsympathetic German old maids who formed the
rank-and-file of my fellow-boarders. There they sat&mdash;eight
comfortable Fraus who had missed their vocation; plentiful ladies,
bulging and surging in tightly stretched black silk bodices. They
had been cut out for such housewives as Harold Tillington had
described, but found themselves deprived of their natural sphere in
life by the unaccountable caprice of the men of their nation. Each
was a model Teutonic matron <i>manqu&eacute;e</i>. Each looked
capable of frying Frankfort sausages to a turn, and knitting
woollen socks to a remote eternity. But I sought in vain for one
kindred soul among them. How horrified they would have been, with
their fat pudding-faces and big saucer-eyes, had I boldly announced
myself as an English adventuress!<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<p>I spent my first morning in laborious self-education at the
Ariadneum and the St&auml;del Gallery. I borrowed a catalogue. I
wrestled with Van der Weyden; I toiled like a galley-slave at
Meister Wilhelm and Meister Stephan. I have a confused recollection
that I saw a number of stiff medi&aelig;val pictures, and an
alabaster statue of the lady who smiled as she rode on a tiger,
taken at the beginning of that interesting episode. But the
remainder of the Institute has faded from my memory.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I consoled myself for my herculean efforts in
the direction of culture by going out for a bicycle ride on a hired
machine, to which end I decided to devote my pocket-money. You
will, perhaps, object here that my conduct was imprudent. To raise
that objection is to misunderstand the spirit of these artless
adventures. I told you that I set out to go round the world; but to
go round the world does not necessarily mean to circumnavigate it.
My idea was to go round by easy stages, seeing the world as I went
as far as I got, and taking as little heed as possible of the
morrow. Most of my readers, no doubt, accept that philosophy of
life on Sundays only; on week-days they swallow the usual
contradictory economic platitudes about prudential forethought and
the horrid improvidence of the lower classes. For myself, I am not
built that way. I prefer to take life in a spirit of pure inquiry.
I put on my hat: I saunter where I choose, so far as circumstances
permit; and I wait to see what chance will bring me. My ideal is
breeziness.</p>
<p>The hired bicycle was not a bad machine, as hired bicycles go;
it jolted one as little as you can expect from a common hack; it
never stopped at a Bier-Garten; and it showed very few signs of
having been ridden by beginners with an unconquerable desire to
tilt at the hedgerow. So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id=
"Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> off I soared at once, heedless of the
jeers of Teutonic youth who found the sight of a lady riding a
cycle in skirts a strange one&mdash;for in South Germany the
'rational' costume is so universal among women cyclists that 'tis
the skirt that provokes unfavourable comment from those jealous
guardians of female propriety, the street boys. I hurried on at a
brisk pace past the Palm-Garden and the suburbs, with my loose hair
straying on the breeze behind, till I found myself pedalling at a
good round pace on a broad, level road, which led towards a
village, by name Fraunheim.</p>
<p>As I scurried across the plain, with the wind in my face, not
unpleasantly, I had some dim consciousness of somebody unknown
flying after me headlong. My first idea was that Harold Tillington
had hunted me down and tracked me to my lair; but gazing back, I
saw my pursuer was a tall and ungainly man, with a straw-coloured
moustache, apparently American, and that he was following me on his
machine, closely watching my action. He had such a cunning
expression on his face, and seemed so strangely inquisitive, with
eyes riveted on my treadles, that I didn't quite like the look of
him. I put on the pace, to see if I could outstrip him, for I am a
swift cyclist. But his long legs were too much for me. He did not
gain on me, it is true; but neither did I outpace him. Pedalling my
very hardest&mdash;and I can make good time when necessary&mdash;I
still kept pretty much at the same distance in front of him all the
way to Fraunheim.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="ILL_016" id=

height="328" alt="HE KEPT CLOSE AT MY HEELS." title="">
<span class="caption">HE KEPT CLOSE AT MY HEELS.</span></div>
<p>Gradually I began to feel sure that the weedy-looking man with
the alert face was really pursuing me. When I went faster, he went
faster too; when I gave him a chance to pass me, he kept close at
my heels, and appeared to be keenly watching the style of my
ankle-action. I gathered that he was a connoisseur; but why on
earth he should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id=
"Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> persecute me I could not imagine. My
spirit was roused now&mdash; I pedalled with a will; if I rode all
day I would not let him go past me.</p>
<p>Beyond the cobble-paved chief street of Fraunheim the road took
a sharp bend, and began to mount the slopes of the Taunus suddenly.
It was an abrupt, steep climb; but I flatter myself I am a
tolerable mountain cyclist. I rode sturdily on; my pursuer darted
after me. But on this stiff upward grade my light weight and agile
ankle-action told; I began to distance him. He seemed afraid that I
would give him the slip, and called out suddenly, with a whoop, in
English, 'Stop, miss!' I looked back with dignity, but answered
nothing. He put on the pace, panting; I pedalled away, and got
clear from him.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;"><a name="ILL_017" id=

height="450" alt="I WAS PULLED UP SHORT BY A MOUNTED POLICEMAN."
title=""> <span class="caption">I WAS PULLED UP SHORT BY A MOUNTED
POLICEMAN.</span></div>
<p>At a turn of the corner, however, as luck would have it, I was
pulled up short by a mounted policeman. He blocked<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> the
road with his horse, like an ogre, and asked me, in a very gruff
Swabian voice, if this was a licensed bicycle. I had no idea, till
he spoke, that any license was required; though to be sure I might
have guessed it; for modern Germany is studded with notices at all
the street corners, to inform you in minute detail that everything
is forbidden. I stammered out that I did not know. The mounted
policeman drew near and inspected me rudely. 'It is strongly
undersaid,' he began, but just at that moment my pursuer came up,
and, with American quickness, took in the situation. He<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
accosted the policeman in choice bad German. 'I have two licenses,'
he said, producing a handful. 'The Fr&auml;ulein rides with
me.'</p>
<p>I was too much taken aback at so providential an interposition
to contradict this highly imaginative statement. My highwayman had
turned into a protecting knight-errant of injured innocence. I let
the policeman go his way; then I glanced at my preserver. A very
ordinary modern St. George he looked, with no lance to speak of,
and no steed but a bicycle. Yet his mien was reassuring.</p>
<p>'Good morning, miss,' he began&mdash;he called me 'Miss' every
time he addressed me, as though he took me for a barmaid. 'Ex-cuse
<i>me</i>, but why did you want to speed her?'</p>
<p>'I thought you were pursuing me,' I answered, a little
tremulous, I will confess, but avid of incident.</p>
<p>'And if I was,' he went on, 'you might have con-jectured, miss,
it was for our mutual advantage. A business man don't go out of his
way unless he expects to turn an honest dollar; and he don't reckon
on other folks going out of theirs, unless he knows he can put them
in the way of turning an honest dollar with him.'</p>
<p>'That's reasonable,' I answered: for I am a political economist.
'The benefit should be mutual.' But I wondered if he was going to
propose at sight to me.</p>
<p>He looked me all up and down. 'You're a lady of con-siderable
personal attractions,' he said, musingly, as if he were criticising
a horse; 'and I want one that sort. That's jest why I trailed you,
see? Besides which, there's some style about you.'</p>
<p>'Style!' I repeated.</p>
<p>'Yes,' he went on; 'you know how to use your feet; and you have
good understandings.'</p>
<p>I gathered from his glance that he referred to my
nether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg
66]</a></span> limbs. We are all vertebrate animals; why seek to
conceal the fact?</p>
<p>'I fail to follow you,' I answered frigidly; for I really didn't
know what the man might say next.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 441px;"><a name="ILL_018" id=
"ILL_018"></a> <img src="1302191h-images/ill_018.jpg" width="441"
height="500" alt="SEEMS I DIDN&#39;T MAKE MUCH OF A JOB OF IT."
title=""> <span class="caption">SEEMS I DIDN&#39;T MAKE MUCH OF A
JOB OF IT.</span></div>
<p>'That's so!' he replied. 'It was <i>I</i> that followed
<i>you</i>; seems I didn't make much of a job of it, either,
anyway.'</p>
<p>I mounted my machine again. 'Well, good morning,'<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> I said,
coldy. 'I am much obliged for your kind assistance; but your remark
was fictitious, and I desire to go on unaccompanied.'</p>
<p>He held up his hand in warning. 'You ain't going!' he cried,
horrified. 'You ain't going without hearing me! I mean business,
say! Don't chuck away good money like that. I tell you, there's
dollars in it.'</p>
<p>'In what?' I asked, still moving on, but curious. On the slope,
if need were, I could easily distance him.</p>
<p>'Why, in this cycling of yours,' he replied. 'You're jest about
the very woman I'm looking for, miss. Lithe&mdash;that's what I
call you. I kin put you in the way of making your pile, I kin. This
is a <i>bon&acirc;-fide</i> offer. No flies on <i>my</i> business!
You decline it? Prejudice! Injures you; injures me! Be reasonable
anyway!'</p>
<p>I looked round and laughed. 'Formulate yourself,' I said,
briefly.</p>
<p>He rose to it like a man. 'Meet me at Fraunheim; corner by the
Post Office; ten o'clock to-morrow morning,' he shouted, as I rode
off, 'and ef I don't convince you there's money in this job, my
name's not Cyrus W. Hitchcock.'</p>
<p>Something about his keen, unlovely face impressed me with a
sense of his underlying honesty. 'Very well,' I answered,'I'll
come, if you follow me no further.' I reflected that Fraunheim was
a populous village, and that only beyond it did the mountain road
over the Taunus begin to grow lonely. If he wished to cut my
throat, I was well within reach of the resources of
civilisation.</p>
<p>When I got home to the Abode of Blighted Fraus that evening, I
debated seriously with myself whether or not I should accept Mr.
Cyrus W. Hitchcock's mysterious invitation. Prudence said
<i>no</i>; curiosity said <i>yes</i>; I put the question to a
meeting of one; and, since I am a daughter of Eve, curiosity had
it. Carried unanimously. I think I<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> might have hesitated,
indeed, had it not been for the Blighted Fraus. Their talk was of
dinner and of the digestive process; they were critics of
digestion. They each of them sat so complacently through the
evening&mdash;solid and stolid, stodgy and podgy, stuffed comatose
images, knitting white woollen shawls, to throw over their
capacious shoulders at <i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i>&mdash;and they
purred with such content in their middle-aged rotundity that I made
up my mind I must take warning betimes, and avoid their temptations
to adipose deposit. I prefer to grow upwards; the Frau grows
sideways. Better get my throat cut by an American desperado, in my
pursuit of romance, than settle down on a rock like a placid fat
oyster. I am not by nature sessile.</p>
<p>Adventures are to the adventurous. They abound on every side;
but only the chosen few have the courage to embrace them. And they
will not come to you: you must go out to seek them. Then they meet
you half-way, and rush into your arms, for they know their true
lovers. There were eight Blighted Fraus at the Home for Lost
Ideals, and I could tell by simple inspection that they had not had
an average of half an adventure per lifetime between them. They sat
and knitted still, like Awful Examples.</p>
<p>If I had declined to meet Mr. Hitchcock at Fraunheim, I know not
what changes it might have induced in my life. I might now be
knitting. But I went boldly forth, on a voyage of exploration,
prepared to accept aught that fate held in store for me.</p>
<p>As Mr. Hitchcock had assured me there was money in his offer, I
felt justified in speculating. I expended another three marks on
the hire of a bicycle, though I ran the risk thereby of going
perhaps without Monday's dinner. That showed my vocation. The
Blighted Fraus, I felt sure, would have clung to their dinner at
all hazards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id=
"Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<p>When I arrived at Fraunheim, I found my alert American
punctually there before me. He raised his crush hat with awkward
politeness. I could see he was little accustomed to ladies'
society. Then he pointed to a close cab in which he had reached the
village.</p>
<p>'I've got it inside,' he whispered, in a confidential tone. 'I
couldn't let 'em ketch sight of it. You see, there's dollars in
it.'</p>
<p>'What have you got inside?' I asked, suspiciously, drawing back.
I don't know why, but the word 'it' somehow suggested a corpse. I
began to grow frightened.</p>
<p>'Why, the wheel, of course,' he answered. 'Ain't you come here
to ride it?'</p>
<p>'Oh, the wheel?' I echoed, vaguely, pretending to look wise; but
unaware, as yet, that that word was the accepted Americanism for a
cycle. 'And I have come to ride it?'</p>
<p>'Why, certainly,' he replied, jerking his hand towards the cab.
'But we mustn't start right here. This thing has got to be kept
dark, don't you see, till the last day.'</p>
<p>Till the last day! That was ominous. It sounded like monomania.
So ghostly and elusive! I began to suspect my American ally of
being a dangerous madman.</p>
<p>'Jest you wheel away a bit up the hill,' he went on, 'out o'
sight of the folks, and I'll fetch her along to you.'</p>
<p>'Her?' I cried. 'Who?' For the man bewildered me.</p>
<p>'Why, the wheel, miss! <i>You</i> understand! This is business,
you bet! And you're jest the right woman!'</p>
<p>He motioned me on. Urged by a sort of spell, I remounted my
machine and rode out of the village. He followed, on the box-seat
of his cab. Then, when we had left the world well behind, and stood
among the sun-smitten boles of the pine-trees, he opened the door
mysteriously, and produced from the vehicle a very odd-looking
bicycle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg
70]</a></span></p>
<p>It was clumsy to look at. It differed immensely, in many
particulars, from any machine I had yet seen or ridden.</p>
<p>The strenuous American fondled it for a moment with his hand, as
if it were a pet child. Then he mounted nimbly. Pride shone in his
eye. I saw in a second he was a fond inventor.</p>
<p>He rode a few yards on. Next he turned to me eagerly. 'This
ma-chine,' he said, in an impressive voice, '<i>is</i> pro-pelled
<i>by</i> an eccentric.' Like all his countrymen, he laid most
stress on unaccented syllables.</p>
<p>'Oh, I knew you were an eccentric,' I said, 'the moment I set
eyes upon you.'</p>
<p>He surveyed me gravely. 'You misunderstand me, miss,' he
corrected. '<i>When</i> I say an eccentric, I mean, a crank.'</p>
<p>'They are much the same thing,' I answered, briskly. 'Though I
confess I would hardly have applied so rude a word as <i>crank</i>
to you.'</p>
<p>He looked me over suspiciously, as if I were trying to make game
of him, but my face was sphinx-like. So he brought the machine a
yard or two nearer, and explained its construction to me. He was
quite right: it <i>was</i> driven by a crank. It had no chain, but
was moved by a pedal, working narrowly up and down, and attached to
a rigid bar, which impelled the wheels by means of an
eccentric.</p>
<p>Besides this, it had a curious device for altering the gearing
automatically while one rode, so as to enable one to adapt it to
the varying slope in mounting hills. This part of the mechanism he
explained to me elaborately. There was a gauge in front which
allowed one to sight the steepness of the slope by mere inspection;
and according as the gauge marked one, two, three, or four, as its
gradient on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id=
"Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> scale, the rider pressed a button on
the handle-bar with his left hand once, twice, thrice, or four
times, so that the gearing adapted itself without an effort to the
rise in the surface. Besides, there were devices for rigidity and
compensation. Altogether, it was a most apt and ingenious piece of
mechanism. I did not wonder he was proud of it.</p>
<p>'Get up and ride, miss,' he said in a persuasive voice.</p>
<p>I did as I was bid. To my immense surprise, I ran up the steep
hill as smoothly and easily as if it were a perfectly-laid
level.</p>
<p>'Goes nicely, doesn't she?' Mr. Hitchcock murmured, rubbing his
hands.</p>
<p>'Beautifully,' I answered. 'One could ride such a machine up
Mont Blanc, I should fancy.'</p>
<p>He stroked his chin with nervous fingers. 'It ought to knock
'em,' he said, in an eager voice. 'It's geared to run up most
anything in creation.'</p>
<p>'How steep?'</p>
<p>'One foot in three.'</p>
<p>'That's good.'</p>
<p>'Yes. It'll climb Mount Washington.'</p>
<p>'What do you call it?' I asked.</p>
<p>He looked me over with close scrutiny.</p>
<p>'In Amurrica,' he said, slowly, 'we call it the Great Manitou,
because it kin do pretty well what it chooses; but in Europe, I am
thinking of calling it the Martin Conway or the Whymper, or
something like that.'</p>
<p>'Why so?'</p>
<p>'Well, because it's a famous mountain climber.'</p>
<p>'I see,' I said. 'With such a machine you'll put a notice on the
Matterhorn, "This hill is dangerous to cyclists."'</p>
<p>He laughed low to himself, and rubbed his hands
again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg
72]</a></span> 'You'll do, miss,' he said. 'You're the right sort,
you are. The moment I seen you, I thought we two could do a trade
together. Benefits me; benefits you. A mutual advantage.
Reciprocity is the soul of business. You hev some go in you, you
hev. There's money in your feet. You'll give these Meinherrs fits.
You'll take the clear-starch out of them.'</p>
<p>'I fail to catch on,' I answered, speaking his own dialect to
humour him.</p>
<p>'Oh, you'll get there all the same,' he replied, stroking his
machine meanwhile. 'It was a squirrel, it was!' (He pronounced it
<i>squirl</i>.) 'It 'ud run up a tree ef it wanted, wouldn't it?'
He was talking to it now as if it were a dog or a baby. 'There,
there, it mustn't kick; it was a frisky little thing! Jest you step
up on it, miss, and have a go at that there mountain.'</p>
<p>I stepped up and had a 'go.' The machine bounded forward like an
agile greyhound. You had but to touch it, and it ran of itself.
Never had I ridden so vivacious, so animated a cycle. I returned to
him, sailing, with the gradient reversed. The Manitou glided
smoothly, as on a gentle slope, without the need for
back-pedalling.</p>
<p>'It soars!' he remarked with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>'Balloons are at discount beside it,' I answered.</p>
<p>'Now you want to know about this business, I guess,' he went on.
'You want to know jest where the reciprocity comes in, anyhow?'</p>
<p>'I am ready to hear you expound,' I admitted, smiling.</p>
<p>'Oh, it ain't all on one side,' he continued, eyeing his machine
at an angle with parental affection. 'I'm a-going to make your
fortune right here. You shall ride her for me on the last day; and
ef you pull this thing off, don't you be scared that I won't treat
you handsome.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id=
"Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<p>'If you were a little more succinct,' I said, gravely, 'we
should get forrader faster.'</p>
<p>'Perhaps you wonder,' he put in, 'that with money on it like
this, I should intrust the job <i>into</i> the hands of a female.'
I winced, but was silent. 'Well, it's like this, don't you see; ef
a female wins, it makes success all the more striking and
con-spicuous. The world to-day <i>is</i> ruled <i>by</i>
adver<i>tize</i>ment.'</p>
<p>I could stand it no longer. 'Mr. Hitchcock,' I said, with
dignity, 'I haven't the remotest idea what on earth you are talking
about.'</p>
<p>He gazed at me with surprise. 'What?' he exclaimed, at last.
'And you kin cycle like that! Not know what all the cycling world
is mad about! Why, you don't mean to tell me you're not a
pro-fessional?'</p>
<p>I enlightened him at once as to my position in society, which
was respectable, if not lucrative. His face fell somewhat.
'High-toned, eh? Still, you'd run all the same, wouldn't you?' he
inquired.</p>
<p>'Run for what?' I asked, innocently. 'Parliament? The
Presidency? The Frankfort Town Council?'</p>
<p>He had difficulty in fathoming the depths of my ignorance. But
by degrees I understood him. It seemed that the German Imperial and
Prussian Royal Governments had offered a Kaiserly and Kingly prize
for the best military bicycle; the course to be run over the
Taunus, from Frankfort to Limburg; the winning machine to get the
equivalent of a thousand pounds; each firm to supply its own make
and rider. The 'last day' was Saturday next; and the Great Manitou
was the dark horse of the contest.</p>
<p>Then all was clear as day to me. Mr. Cyrus W. Hitchcock was
keeping his machine a profound secret; he wanted a woman to ride
it, so that his triumph might be the more<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
complete; and the moment he saw me pedal up the hill, in trying to
avoid him, he recognised at once that I was that woman.</p>
<p>I recognised it too. 'Twas a pre-ordained harmony. After two or
three trials I felt that the Manitou was built for me, and I was
built for the Manitou. We ran together like parts of one mechanism.
I was always famed for my circular ankle-action; and in this new
machine, ankle-action was everything. Strength of limb counted for
naught; what told was the power of 'clawing up again' promptly. I
possess that power: I have prehistoric feet: my remote progenitors
must certainly have been tree-haunting monkeys.</p>
<p>We arranged terms then and there.</p>
<p>'You accept?'</p>
<p>'Implicitly.'</p>
<p>If I pulled off the race, I was to have fifty pounds. If I
didn't, I was to have five. 'It ain't only your skill, you see,'
Mr. Hitchcock said, with frank commercialism. 'It's your personal
attractiveness as well that I go upon. That's an element to
consider in business relations.'</p>
<p>'My face is my fortune,' I answered, gravely. He nodded
acquiescence.</p>
<p>Till Saturday, then, I was free. Meanwhile, I trained, and
practised quietly with the Manitou, in sequestered parts of the
hills. I also took spells, turn about, at the St&auml;del
Institute. I like to intersperse culture and athletics. I know
something about athletics, and hope in time to acquire a taste for
culture. 'Tis expected of a Girton girl, though my own
accomplishments run rather towards rowing, punting, bicycling.</p>
<p>On Saturday, I confess, I rose with great misgivings. I was not
a professional; and to find oneself practically backed for a
thousand pounds in a race against men is a<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> trifle
disquieting. Still, having once put my hand to the plough, I felt I
was bound to pull it through somehow. I dressed my hair neatly, in
a very tight coil. I ate a light breakfast, eschewing the fried
sausages which the Blighted Fraus pressed upon my notice, and
satisfying myself with a gently-boiled egg and some toast and
coffee. I always found I rowed best at Cambridge on the lightest
diet; in my opinion, the raw beef <i>r&eacute;gime</i> is a serious
error in training.</p>
<p>At a minute or two before eleven I turned up at the Schiller
Platz in my short serge dress and cycling jacket. The great square
was thronged with spectators to see us start; the police made a
lane through their midst for the riders. My backer had advised me
to come to the post as late as possible, 'For I have entered your
name,' he said, 'simply as Lois Cayley. These Deutschers don't
think but what you're a man and a brother. But I am apprehensive of
con-tingencies. When you put in a show they'll try to raise
objections to you on account of your being a female. There won't be
much time, though, and I shall rush the objections. Once they let
you run and win, it don't matter to me whether I get the twenty
thousand marks or not. It's the adver<i>tize</i>ment that tells.
Jest you mark my words, miss, and don't you make no mistake about
it&mdash;the world to-day is governed by adver<i>tize</i>ment.'</p>
<p>So I turned up at the last moment, and cast a timid glance at my
competitors. They were all men, of course, and two of them were
German officers in a sort of undress cycling uniform. They eyed me
superciliously. One of them went up and spoke to the Herr
Over-Superintendent who had charge of the contest. I understood him
to be lodging an objection against a mere woman taking part in the
race. The Herr Over-Superintendent, a bulky official, came up
beside me and perpended visibly. He bent his<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> big
brows to it. 'Twas appalling to observe the measurable amount of
Teutonic cerebration going on under cover of his round, green
glasses. He was perpending for some minutes. Time was almost up.
Then he turned to Mr. Hitchcock, having finally made up his
colossal mind, and murmured rudely, 'The woman cannot compete.'</p>
<p>'Why not?' I inquired, in my very sweetest German, with an
angelic smile, though my heart trembled.</p>
<p>'Warum nicht? Because the word "rider" in the Kaiserly and
Kingly for-this-contest-provided decree is distinctly in the
masculine gender stated.'</p>
<p>'Pardon me, Herr Over-Superintendent,' I replied, pulling out a
copy of Law 97 on the subject, with which I had duly provided
myself, 'if you will to Section 45 of the
Bicycles-Circulation-Regulation-Act your attention turn, you will
find it therein expressly enacted that unless any clause be
anywhere to the contrary inserted, the word "rider," in the
masculine gender put, shall here the word "rideress" in the
feminine to embrace be considered.'</p>
<p>For, anticipating this objection, I had taken the precaution to
look the legal question up beforehand.</p>
<p>'That is true,' the Herr Over-Superintendent observed, in a
musing voice, gazing down at me with relenting eyes. 'The masculine
habitually embraces the feminine.' And he brought his massive
intellect to bear upon the problem once more with prodigious
concentration.</p>
<p>I seized my opportunity. 'Let me start, at least,' I urged,
holding out the Act. 'If I win, you can the matter more fully with
the Kaiserly and Kingly Governments hereafter argue out.'</p>
<p>'I guess this will be an international affair,' Mr. Hitchcock
remarked, well pleased. 'It would be a first-rate
adver<i>tize</i>ment for the Great Manitou ef England
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg
77]</a></span> Germany were to make the question into a <i>casus
belli</i>. The United States could look on, and pocket the
chestnuts.'</p>
<p>'Two minutes to go,' the official starter with the watch called
out.</p>
<p>'Fall in, then, Fr&auml;ulein Engl&auml;nderin,' the Herr
Over-Superintendent observed, without prejudice, waving me into
line. He pinned a badge with a large number, 7, on my dress. 'The
Kaiserly and Kingly Governments shall on the affair of the
starting's legality hereafter on my report more at leisure pass
judgment.'</p>
<p>The lieutenant in undress uniform drew back a little.</p>
<p>'Oh, if this is to be woman's play,' he muttered, 'then can a
Prussian officer himself by competing not into contempt bring.'</p>
<p>I dropped a little curtsy. 'If the Herr Lieutenant is afraid
even to <i>enter</i> against an Englishwoman&mdash;&mdash;' I said,
smiling.</p>
<p>He came up to the scratch sullenly. 'One minute to go!' called
out the starter.</p>
<p>We were all on the alert. There was a pause; a deep breath. I
was horribly frightened, but I tried to look calm. Then sharp and
quick came the one word 'Go!' And like arrows from a bow, off we
all started.</p>
<p>I had ridden over the whole course the day but one before, on a
mountain pony, with an observant eye and my sedulous
American&mdash;rising at five o'clock, so as not to excite undue
attention; and I therefore knew beforehand the exact route we were
to follow; but I confess when I saw the Prussian lieutenant and one
of my other competitors dash forward at a pace that simply
astonished me, that fifty pounds seemed to melt away in the dim
abyss of the Ewigkeit. I gave up all for lost. I could never make
the running against such practised cyclists.<span class=

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;"><a name="ILL_019" id=

SCORCH.</span></div>
<p>However, we all turned out into the open road which leads across
the plain and down the Main valley, in the direction of Mayence.
For the first ten miles or so, it is a dusty level. The surface is
perfect; but 'twas a blinding white thread. As I toiled along it,
that broiling June day, I could hear the voice of my backer, who
followed on horseback, exhorting me in loud tones, 'Don't scorch,
miss; don't scorch; never mind ef you lose sight of 'em. Keep your
wind; that's the point. The wind, the wind's everything. Let 'em
beat you on the level; you'll catch 'em up fast enough when you get
on the Taunus!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id=
"Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<p>But in spite of his encouragement, I almost lost heart as I saw
one after another of my opponents' backs disappear in the distance,
till at last I was left toiling along the bare white road alone, in
a shower-bath of sunlight, with just a dense cloud of dust rising
gray far ahead of me. My head swam. It repented me of my
boldness.</p>
<p>Then the riders on horseback began to grumble; for by police
regulation they were not allowed to pass the hindmost of the
cyclists; and they were kept back by my presence from following up
their special champions. 'Give it up, Fr&auml;ulein, give it up!'
they cried. 'You're beaten. Let us pass and get forward.' But at
the self-same moment, I heard the shrill voice of my American
friend whooping aloud across the din, 'Don't you do nothing of the
sort, miss! You stick to it, and keep your wind! It's the wind that
wins! Them Germans won't be worth a cent on the high slopes,
anyway!'</p>
<p>Encouraged by his voice, I worked steadily on, neither scorching
nor relaxing, but maintaining an even pace at my natural pitch
under the broiling sunshine. Heat rose in waves on my face from the
road below; in the thin white dust, the accusing tracks of six
wheels confronted me. Still I kept on following them, till I
reached the town of H&ouml;chst&mdash;nine miles from Frankfort.
Soldiers along the route were timing us at intervals with
chronometers, and noting our numbers. As I rattled over the paved
High Street, I called aloud to one of them. 'How far ahead the last
man?'</p>
<p>He shouted back, good-humouredly: 'Four minutes,
Fr&auml;ulein.'</p>
<p>Again I lost heart. Then I mounted a slight slope, and felt how
easily the Manitou moved up the gradient. From its summit I could
note a long gray cloud of dust rolling steadily onward down the
hill towards Hattersheim.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80"
id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<p>I coasted down, with my feet up, and a slight breeze just
cooling me. Mr. Hitchcock, behind, called out, full-throated, from
his seat, 'No hurry! No flurry! Take your time!
Take&mdash;your&mdash;time, miss!'</p>
<p>Over the bridge at Hattersheim you turn to the right abruptly,
and begin to mount by the side of a pretty little stream, the
Schwarzbach, which runs brawling over rocks down the Taunus from
Eppstein. By this time the excitement had somewhat cooled down for
the moment; I was getting reconciled to be beaten on the level, and
began to realise that my chances would be best as we approached the
steepest bits of the mountain road about Niederhausen. So I
positively plucked up heart to look about me and enjoy the scenery.
With hair flying behind&mdash;that coil had played me false&mdash;I
swept through Hofheim, a pleasant little village at the mouth of a
grassy valley inclosed by wooded slopes, the Schwarzbach making
cool music in the glen below as I mounted beside it. Clambering
larches, like huge candelabra, stood out on the ridge, silhouetted
against the skyline.</p>
<p>'How far ahead the last man?' I cried to the recording soldier.
He answered me back, 'Two minutes, Fr&auml;ulein.'</p>
<p>I was gaining on them; I was gaining! I thundered across the
Schwarzbach, by half-a-dozen clamorous little iron bridges, making
easy time now, and with my feet working as if they were themselves
an integral part of the machinery. Up, up, up; it looked a vertical
ascent; the Manitou glided well in its oil-bath at its half-way
gearing. I rode for dear life. At sixteen miles, Lorsbach; at
eighteen, Eppstein; the road still rising. 'How far ahead the last
man?' 'Just round the corner, Fr&auml;ulein!'</p>
<p>I put on a little steam. Sure enough, round the corner I caught
sight of his back. With a spurt, I passed him&mdash;a dust-covered
soul, very hot and uncomfortable. He had not<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> kept
his wind; I flew past him like a whirlwind. But, oh, how sultry hot
in that sweltering, close valley! A pretty little town, Eppstein,
with its medi&aelig;val castle perched high on a craggy rock. I
owed it some gratitude, I felt, as I left it behind, for 'twas here
that I came up with the tail-end of my opponents.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;"><a name="ILL_020" id=

height="386" alt="HOW FAR AHEAD THE FIRST MAN?" title="">
<span class="caption">HOW FAR AHEAD THE FIRST MAN?</span></div>
<p>That one victory cheered me. So far, our route had lain along
the well-made but dusty high road in the steaming valley; at
Nieder-Josbach, two miles on, we quitted the road abruptly, by the
course marked out for us, and turned up a mountain path, only wide
enough for two cycles abreast&mdash;a path that clambered towards
the higher slopes of the Taunus. That was arranged on
purpose&mdash;for this was no fair-weather show, but a practical
trial for military bicycles, under the conditions they might meet
with in actual warfare. It was rugged riding: black walls of pine
rose steep on either hand; the ground was uncertain. Our path
mounted sharply from the first; the steeper the better. By the time
I had reached Ober-Josbach, nestling high among larch-woods, I had
distanced all but two of my opponents. It was cooler now, too. As I
passed the hamlet my cry altered.</p>
<p>'How far ahead the first man?'.</p>
<p>'Two minutes, Fr&auml;ulein,'</p>
<p>'A civilian?'</p>
<p>'No, no; a Prussian officer.'</p>
<p>The Herr Lieutenant led, then. For Old England's sake, I felt I
must beat him.</p>
<p>The steepest slope of all lay in the next two miles. If I were
going to win I must pass these two there, for my advantage lay all
in the climb; if it came to coasting, the men's mere weight scored
a point in their favour. Bump, crash, jolt! I pedalled away like a
machine; the Manitou sobbed; my ankles flew round so that I
scarcely felt them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id=
"Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> But the road was rough and scarred
with waterways&mdash;ruts turned by rain to runnels. At half a
mile, after a desperate struggle among sand and pebbles, I passed
the second man; just ahead, the Prussian officer looked round and
saw me. 'Thunder-weather! you there, Engl&auml;nderin?' he cried,
darting me a look of unchivalrous dislike, such as only your
sentimental German can cast at a woman.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;"><a name="ILL_021" id=

height="428" alt="I AM HERE BEHIND YOU, HERR LIEUTENANT." title="">
<span class="caption">I AM HERE BEHIND YOU, HERR
LIEUTENANT.</span></div>
<p>'Yes, I am here, behind you, Herr Lieutenant,' I answered,
putting on a spurt; 'and I hope next to be before you.'</p>
<p>He answered not a word, but worked his hardest. So did I. He
bent forward: I sat erect on my Manitou,<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> pulling
hard at my handles. Now, my front wheel was upon him. It reached
his pedal. We were abreast. He had a narrow thread of solid path,
and he forced me into a runnel. Still I gained. He swerved: I think
he tried to foul me. But the slope was too steep; his attempt
recoiled on himself; he ran against the rock at the side and almost
overbalanced. That second lost him. I waved my hand as I sailed
ahead. 'Good morning,' I cried, gaily. 'See you again at
Limburg!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg
84]</a></span></p>
<p>From the top of the slope I put my feet up and flew down into
Idstein. A thunder-shower burst: I was glad of the cool of it. It
laid the dust. I regained the high road. From that moment, save for
the risk of sideslips, 'twas easy running&mdash;just an undulating
line with occasional ups and downs; but I saw no more of my
pursuers till, twenty-two kilometres farther on, I rattled on the
cobble-paved causeway into Limburg. I had covered the forty-six
miles in quick time for a mountain climb. As I crossed the bridge
over the Lahn, to my immense surprise, Mr. Hitchcock waved his
arms, all excitement, to greet me. He had taken the train on from
Eppstein, it seemed, and got there before me. As I dismounted at
the Cathedral, which was our appointed end, and gave my badge to
the soldier, he rushed up and shook my hand. 'Fifty pounds!' he
cried. 'Fifty pounds! How's that for the great Anglo-Saxon race!
And hooray for the Manitou!'</p>
<p>The second man, the civilian, rode in, wet and draggled, forty
seconds later. As for the Herr Lieutenant, a disappointed man, he
fell out by the way, alleging a puncture. I believe he was ashamed
to admit the fact that he had been beaten in open fight by the
objurgated Engl&auml;nderin.</p>
<p>So the end of it was, I was now a woman of means, with fifty
pounds of my own to my credit.</p>
<p>I lunched with my backer royally at the best inn in
Limburg.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg

<h3>THE ADVENTURE OF THE AMATEUR COMMISSION AGENT</h3>
<p>My eccentric American had assured me that if I won the great
race for him I need not be 'skeert' lest he should fail to treat me
well; and to do him justice, I must admit that he kept his word
magnanimously. While we sat at lunch in the cosy hotel at Limburg
he counted out and paid me in hand the fifty good gold pieces he
had promised me. 'Whether these Deutschers fork out my twenty
thousand marks or not,' he said, in his brisk way, 'it don't much
matter. I shall get the contract, and I shall hev gotten the
adver<i>tize</i>ment!'</p>
<p>'Why do you start your bicycles in Germany, though?' I asked,
innocently. 'I should have thought myself there was so much a
better chance of selling them in England.'</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;"><a name="ILL_022" id=

<span class="caption">LET THEM BOOM OR BUST ON IT.</span></div>
<p>He closed one eye, and looked abstractedly at the light through
his glass of pale yellow Brauneberger with the other. 'England?
Yes, England! Well, see, miss, you hev not been raised in business.
Business is business. The way to do it in Germany is&mdash;to
manufacture for yourself: and I've got my works started right here
in Frankfort. The way to do it in England&mdash;where capital's
dirt cheap&mdash;is, to sell your patent for every cent it's worth
to an English company, and let them boom or bust on
it.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg
86]</a></span></p>
<p>'I see,' I said, catching at it. 'The principle's as clear as
mud, the moment you point it out to one. An English company will
pay you well for the concession, and work for a smaller return on
its investment than you Americans are content to receive on your
capital!'</p>
<p>'That's so! You hit it in one, miss! Which will you take, a
cigar or a cocoa-nut?'</p>
<p>I smiled. 'And what do you think you will call the machine in
Europe?'</p>
<p>He gazed hard at me, and stroked his straw-coloured moustache.
'Well, what do <i>you</i> think of the <i>Lois
Cayley</i>?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id=
"Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>
<p>'For Heaven's sake, no!' I cried, fervently. 'Mr. Hitchcock, I
implore you!'</p>
<p>He smiled pity for my weakness. 'Ah, high-toned again?' he
repeated, as if it were some natural malformation under which I
laboured. 'Oh, ef you don't like it, miss, we'll say no more about
it. I am a gentleman, I am. What's the matter with the
<i>Excelsior</i>?'</p>
<p>'Nothing, except that it's very bad Latin,' I objected.</p>
<p>'That may be so; but it's very good business.'</p>
<p>He paused and mused, then he murmured low to himself, '"When
through an Alpine village passed." That's where the idea of the
<i>Excelsior</i> comes in; see? "It goes up Mont Blanc," you said
yourself. "Through snow and ice, A cycle with the strange device,
Excelsior!"'</p>
<p>'If I were you,' I said, 'I would stick to the name
<i>Manitou</i>. It's original, and it's distinctive.'</p>
<p>'Think so? Then chalk it up; the thing's done. You may not be
aware of it, miss, but you are a lady for whose opinion in such
matters I hev a high regard. <i>And</i> you understand Europe. I do
not. I admit it. Everything seems to me to be <i>verboten</i> in
Germany; and everything else to be <i>bad form</i> in England.'</p>
<p>We walked down the steps together. 'What a picturesque old
town!' I said, looking round me, well pleased. Its beauty appealed
to me, for I had fifty pounds in pocket, and I had lunched
sumptuously.</p>
<p>'<i>Old</i> town?' he repeated, gazing with a blank stare. 'You
call this town <i>old</i>, do you?'</p>
<p>'Why, of course! Just look at the cathedral! Eight hundred years
old, at least!'</p>
<p>He ran his eye down the streets, dissatisfied.</p>
<p>'Well, ef this town is old,' he said at last, with a snap
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg
88]</a></span> his fingers, 'it's precious little for its age.' And
he strode away towards the railway station.</p>
<p>'What about the bicycle?' I asked; for it lay, a silent victor,
against the railing of the steps, surrounded by a crowd of
inquiring Teutons.</p>
<p>He glanced at it carelessly. 'Oh, the wheel?' he said. 'You may
keep it.'</p>
<p>He said it so exactly in the tone in which one tells a waiter he
may keep the change, that I resented the impertinence. 'No, thank
you,' I answered. 'I do not require it.'</p>
<p>He gazed at me, open-mouthed. 'What? Put my foot in it again?'
he interposed. 'Not high-toned enough? Eh? Now, I do regret it. No
offence meant, miss, nor none need be taken. What I meant to
in-sinuate was this: you hev won the big race for me. Folks will
notice you and talk about you at Frankfort. Ef you ride a Manitou,
that'll make 'em talk the more. A mutual advantage. Benefits you;
benefits me. You get the wheel; I get the
adver<i>tize</i>ment.'</p>
<p>I saw that reciprocity was the lodestar of his life. 'Very well,
Mr. Hitchcock,' I said, pocketing my pride, 'I'll accept the
machine, and I'll ride it.'</p>
<p>Then a light dawned upon me. I saw eventualities. 'Look here,' I
went on, innocently&mdash;recollect, I was a girl just fresh from
Girton&mdash;'I am thinking of going on very soon to Switzerland.
Now, why shouldn't I do this&mdash;try to sell your machines, or,
rather, take orders for them, from anybody that admires them? A
mutual advantage. Benefits you; benefits me. You sell your wheels;
I get&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>He stared at me. 'The commission?'</p>
<p>'I don't know what commission means,' I answered, somewhat at
sea as to the name; 'but I thought it might be<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> worth
your while, till the Manitou becomes better known, to pay me, say,
ten per cent on all orders I brought you.'</p>
<p>His face was one broad smile. 'I do admire at you, miss,' he
cried, standing still to inspect me. 'You may not know the meaning
of the <i>word</i> commission; but durned ef you haven't got a hang
of the <i>thing</i> itself that would do honour to a Wall Street
operator, anyway.'</p>
<p>'Then that's business?' I asked, eagerly; for I beheld
vistas.</p>
<p>'Business?' he repeated. 'Yes, that's jest about the size of
it&mdash;business. Adver<i>tize</i>ment, miss, may be the soul of
commerce, but Commission's its body. You go in and win. Ten per
cent on every order you send me!'</p>
<p>He insisted on taking my ticket back to Frankfort. 'My affair,
miss; my affair!' There was no gainsaying him. He was immensely
elated. 'The biggest thing in cycles since Dunlop tyres,' he
repeated. 'And to-morrow, they'll give me advertizements gratis in
every newspaper!'</p>
<p>Next morning, he came round to call on me at the Abode of
Unclaimed Domestic Angels. He was explicit and generous. 'Look
here, miss,' he began; 'I didn't do fair by you when you
interviewed me about your agency last evening. I took advantage,
<i>at</i> the time, <i>of</i> your youth and inexperience. You
suggested 10 per cent <i>as</i> the amount of your commission on
sales you might effect; and I jumped at it. That was conduct
unworthy <i>of</i> a gentleman. Now, I will not deceive you. The
ordinary commission on transactions in wheels is 25 per cent. I am
going to sell the Manitou retail at twenty English pounds apiece.
You shall hev your 25 per cent on all orders.'</p>
<p>'Five pounds for every machine I sell?' I exclaimed,
overjoyed.</p>
<p>He nodded. 'That's so.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90"

<p>I was simply amazed at this magnificent prospect. 'The cycle
trade must be honeycombed with middlemen's profits!' I cried; for I
had my misgivings.</p>
<p>'That's so,' he replied again. 'Then jest you take and be a
middlewoman.'</p>
<p>'But, as a consistent socialist&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'It is your duty to fleece the capitalist and the consumer. A
mutual benefit&mdash;triangular this time. I get the order, the
public gets the machine, and you get the commission. I am richer,
you are richer, and the public is mounted on much the best wheel
ever yet invented.'</p>
<p>'That sounds plausible,' I admitted. 'I shall try it on in
Switzerland. I shall run up steep hills whenever I see any likely
customers looking on; then I shall stop and ask them the time, as
if quite accidentally.'</p>
<p>He rubbed his hands. 'You take to business like a young duck to
the water,' he exclaimed, admiringly. 'That's the way to rake 'em
in! You go up and say to them, "Why not investigate? We defy
competition. Leave the drudgery of walking uphill beside your
cycle! Progress is the order of the day. Use modern methods! This
is the age of the telegraph, the telephone, <i>and</i> the
typewriter. You kin no longer afford to go on with an antiquated,
ante-diluvian, armour-plated wheel. Invest in a Hill-Climber, the
last and lightest product of evvolootion. <i>Is</i> it common-sense
to buy an old-style, unautomatic, single-geared, inconvertible
ten-ton machine, when for the same money or less you can purchase
the self-acting Manitou, a priceless gem, as light as a feather,
with all the most recent additions and improvements? Be reasonable!
Get the best!" That's the style to fetch 'em!'</p>
<p>I laughed, in spite of myself. 'Oh, Mr. Hitchcock,' I burst out,
'that's not <i>my</i> style at all. I shall say, simply<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> "This
is a lovely new bicycle. You can see for yourself how it climbs
hills. Try it, if you wish. It skims like a swallow. And I get what
they call five pounds commission on every one I can sell of them!"
I think that way of dealing is much more likely to bring you in
orders.'</p>
<p>His admiration was undisguised. 'Well, I <i>do</i> call you a
woman of business, miss,' he cried. 'You see it at a glance. That's
so. That's the right kind of thing to rope in the Europeans. Some
originality about you. You take 'em on their own ground. You've got
the draw on them, you hev. I like your system. You'll jest haul in
the dollars!'</p>
<p>'I hope so,' I said, fervently; for I had evolved in my own
mind, oh, such a <i>lovely</i> scheme for Elsie Petheridge's
holidays!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg

<p>He gazed at me once more. 'Ef only I could get hold of a woman
of business like you to soar through life with me,' he
murmured.</p>

<p>I grew interested in my shoes. His open admiration was getting
quite embarrassing.</p>
<p>He paused a minute. Then he went on: 'Well, what do you say to
it?'</p>
<p>'To what?' I asked, amazed.</p>
<p>'To my proposition&mdash;my offer.'</p>
<p>'I&mdash; I don't understand,' I stammered out bewildered. 'The
25 per cent, you mean?'</p>
<p>'No, the de-votion of a lifetime,' he answered, looking sideways
at me. 'Miss Cayley, when a business man advances a proposition,
commercial or otherwise, he advances it because he means it. He
asks a prompt reply. Your time is valuable. So is mine. <i>Are</i>
you prepared to consider it?'</p>
<p>'Mr. Hitchcock,' I said, drawing back, 'I think you
misunderstand. I think you do not realise&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'All right, miss,' he answered, promptly, though with a
disappointed air. 'Ef it kin not be managed, it kin not be managed.
I understand your European ex-clusiveness. I know your prejudices.
But this little episode need not antagonise with the normal course
of ordinary business. I respect you, Miss Cayley. You are a lady
<i>of</i> intelligence, <i>of</i> initiative, and <i>of</i>
high-toned culture. I will wish you good day for the present,
without further words; and I shall be happy at any time to receive
your orders on the usual commission.'</p>
<p>He backed out and was gone. He was so honestly blunt that I
really quite liked him.</p>
<p>Next day, I bade a tearless farewell to the Blighted Fraus. When
I told those eight phlegmatic souls I was going, they all said
'So!' much as they had said 'So!' to<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> every previous remark I
had been moved to make to them. 'So' is capital garnishing: but
viewed as a staple of conversation, I find it a trifle vapid, not
to say monotonous.</p>
<p>I set out on my wanderings, therefore, to go round the world on
my own account and my own Manitou, which last I grew to love in
time with a love passing the love of Mr. Cyrus Hitchcock. I carried
the strict necessary before me in a small waterproof bicycling
valise; but I sent on the portmanteau containing my whole estate,
real or personal, to some point in advance which I hoped to reach
from time to time in a day or two. My first day's journey was along
a pleasant road from Frankfort to Heidelberg, some fifty-four miles
in all, skirting the mountains the greater part of the way; the
Manitou took the ups and downs so easily that I diverged at
intervals, to choose side-paths over the wooded hills. I arrived at
Heidelberg as fresh as a daisy, my mount not having turned a hair
meanwhile&mdash;a favourite expression of cyclists which carries
all the more conviction to an impartial mind because of the machine
being obviously hairless. Thence I journeyed on by easy stages to
Karlsruhe, Baden, Appenweier, and Offenburg; where I set my front
wheel resolutely for the Black Forest. It is the prettiest and most
picturesque route to Switzerland; and, being also the hilliest, it
would afford me, I thought, the best opportunity for showing off
the Manitou's paces, and trying my prentice hand as an amateur
cycle-agent.</p>
<p>From the quaint little Black Eagle at Offenburg, however, before
I dashed into the Forest, I sent off a letter to Elsie Petheridge,
setting forth my lovely scheme for her summer holidays. She was
delicate, poor child, and the London winters sorely tried her; I
was now a millionaire, with the better part of fifty pounds in
pocket, so I felt I could afford to be royal in my hospitality. As
I was leaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id=
"Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> Frankfort, I had called at a tourist
agency and bought a second-class circular ticket from London to
Lucerne and back&mdash; I made it second-class because I am opposed
on principle to excessive luxury, and also because it was three
guineas cheaper. Even fifty pounds will not last for ever, though I
could scarce believe it. (You see, I am not wholly free, after all,
from the besetting British vice of prudence.) It was a mighty joy
to me to be able to send this ticket to Elsie, at her lodgings in
Bayswater, pointing out to her that now the whole mischief was
done, and that if she would not come out as soon as her summer
vacation began&mdash;'twas a point of honour with Elsie to say
<i>vacation</i>, instead of <i>holidays</i>&mdash;to join me at
Lucerne, and stop with me as my guest at a mountain <i>pension</i>,
the ticket would be wasted. I love burning my boats; 'tis the only
safe way for securing prompt action.</p>
<p>Then I turned my flying wheels up into the Black Forest, growing
weary of my loneliness&mdash;for it is not all jam to ride by
oneself in Germany&mdash;and longing for Elsie to come out and join
me. I loved to think how her dear pale cheeks would gain colour and
tone on the hills about the Br&uuml;nig, where, for business
reasons (so I said to myself with the conscious pride of the
commission agent), I proposed to pass the greater part of the
summer.</p>
<p>From Offenburg to Hornberg the road makes a good stiff climb of
twenty-seven miles, and some 1200 English feet in altitude, with a
fair number of minor undulations on the way to diversify it. I will
not describe the route, though it is one of the most beautiful I
have ever travelled&mdash;rocky hills, ruined castles, huge,
straight-stemmed pines that clamber up green slopes, or halt in
sombre line against steeps of broken crag; the reality surpasses my
poor powers of description. And the people I passed on the road
were almost as quaint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id=
"Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> and picturesque in their way as the
hills and the villages&mdash;the men in red-lined jackets; the
women in black petticoats, short-waisted green bodices, and
broad-brimmed straw hats with black-and-crimson pompons. But on the
steepest gradient, just before reaching Hornberg, I got my first
nibble&mdash;strange to say, from two German students; they wore
Heidelberg caps, and were toiling up the incline with short, broken
wind; I put on a spurt with the Manitou, and passed them easily. I
did it just at first in pure wantonness of health and strength; but
the moment I was clear of them, it occurred to the business half of
me that here was a good chance of taking an order. Filled with this
bright idea, I dismounted near the summit, and pretended to be
engaged in lubricating my bearings; though as a matter of fact the
Manitou runs in a bath of oil, self-feeding, and needs no looking
after. Presently, my two Heidelbergers straggled up&mdash;hot,
dusty, panting. Woman-like, I pretended to take no notice. One of
them drew near and cast an eye on the Manitou.</p>
<p>'That's a new machine, Fr&auml;ulein,' he said, at last, with
more politeness than I expected.</p>
<p>'It is,' I answered, casually; 'the latest model. Climbs hills
like no other.' And I feigned to mount and glide off towards
Hornberg.</p>
<p>'Stop a moment, pray, Fr&auml;ulein,' my prospective buyer
called out. 'Here, Heinrich, I wish you this new so excellent
mountain-climbing machine, without chain propelled, more fully to
investigate.'</p>
<p>'I am going on to Hornberg,' I said, with mixed feminine guile
and commercial strategy; 'still, if your friend wishes to
look&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

height="510" alt="MINUTE INSPECTION." title=""> <span class=

<p>They both jostled round it, with <i>achs</i> innumerable, and,
after minute inspection, pronounced its principle
<i>wundersch&ouml;n</i>. 'Might I essay it?' Heinrich
asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg
96]</a></span></p>
<p>'Oh, by all means,' I answered. He paced it down hill a few
yards; then skimmed up again.</p>
<p>'It is a bird!' he cried to his friend, with many
guttural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg
97]</a></span> interjections. 'Like the eagle's flight, so soars
it. Come, try the thing, Ludwig!'</p>
<p>'You permit, Fr&auml;ulein?'</p>
<p>I nodded. They both mounted it several times. It behaved like a
beauty. Then one of them asked, 'And where can man of this new so
remarkable machine nearest by purchase himself make possessor?'</p>
<p>'I am the Sole Agent,' I burst out, with swelling dignity. 'If
you will give me your orders, with cash in hand for the amount, I
will send the cycle, carriage paid, to any address you desire in
Germany.'</p>
<p>'You!' they exclaimed, incredulously. 'The Fr&auml;ulein is
pleased to be humorous!'</p>
<p>'Oh, very well,' I answered, vaulting into the saddle; 'If you
choose to doubt my word&mdash;&mdash;' I waved one careless hand
and coasted off. 'Good-morning, meine Herren.'</p>
<p>They lumbered after me on their ramshackled traction-engines.
'Pardon, Fr&auml;ulein! Do not thus go away! Oblige us at least
with the name and address of the maker.'</p>
<p>I perpended&mdash;like the Herr Over-Superintendent at
Frankfort. 'Look here,' I said at last, telling the truth with
frankness, 'I get 25 per cent on all bicycles I sell. I am, as I
say, the maker's Sole Agent. If you order through me, I touch my
profit; if otherwise, I do not. Still, since you seem to be
gentlemen,' they bowed and swelled visibly, 'I will give you the
address of the firm, trusting to your honour to mention my
name'&mdash;I handed them a card&mdash;'if you decide on ordering.
The price of the palfrey is 400 marks. It is worth every pfennig of
it.' And before they could say more, I had spurred my steed and
swept off at full speed round a curve of the highway.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>
<p>I pencilled a note to my American that night from Hornberg,
detailing the circumstance; but I am sorry to say, for the
discredit of humanity, that when those two students wrote the same
evening from their inn in the village to order Manitous, they did
<i>not</i> mention my name, doubtless under the misconception that
by suppressing it they would save my commission. However, it gives
me pleasure to add <i>per contra</i> (as we say in business) that
when I arrived at Lucerne a week or so later I found a letter,
<i>poste restante</i>, from Mr. Cyrus Hitchcock, inclosing an
English ten-pound note. He wrote that he had received two orders
for Manitous from Hornberg; and 'feeling considerable confidence
that these must necessarily originate' from my German students, he
had the pleasure of forwarding me what he hoped would be the first
of many similar commissions.</p>

<span class="caption">FELT A PERFECT LITTLE HYPOCRITE.</span></div>
<p>I will not describe my further adventures on the still steeper
mountain road from Hornberg to Triberg and St. Georgen&mdash;how I
got bites on the way from an English curate, an Austrian hussar,
and two unprotected American ladies; nor how I angled for them all
by riding my machine up impossible hills, and then reclining
gracefully to eat my lunch (three times in one day) on mossy banks
at the summit. I felt a perfect little hypocrite. But Mr. Hitchcock
had remarked that business is business; and I will only add (in
confirmation of his view) that by the time I reached Lucerne, I had
sown the good seed in fifteen separate human souls, no less than
four of which brought forth fruit in orders for Manitous before the
end of the season.</p>
<p>I had now so little fear what the morrow might bring forth that
I settled down in a comfortable hotel at Lucerne till Elsie's
holidays began; and amused myself meanwhile<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> by
picking out the hilliest roads I could find in the neighbourhood,
in order to display my steel steed's possibilities to the best
advantage.</p>
<p>By the end of July, Elsie joined me. She was half-angry at first
that I should have forced the ticket and my hospitality upon
her.</p>
<p>'Nonsense, dear,' I said, smoothing her hair, for her pale face
quite frightened me. 'What is the good of a friend if she will not
allow you to do her little favours?'</p>
<p>'But, Brownie, you said you wouldn't stop and be dependent upon
<i>me</i> one day longer than was necessary in London.'<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<p>'That was different,' I cried. 'That was Me! This is You! I am a
great, strong, healthy thing, fit to fight the battle of life and
take care of myself; you, Elsie, are one of those fragile little
flowers which 'tis everybody's duty to protect and to care
for.'</p>
<p>She would have protested more; but I stifled her mouth with
kisses. Indeed, for nothing did I rejoice in my prosperity so much
as for the chance it gave me of helping poor dear overworked,
overwrought Elsie.</p>
<p>We took up our quarters thenceforth at a high-perched little
guest-house near the top of the Br&uuml;nig. It was bracing for
Elsie; and it lay close to a tourist track where I could spread my
snares and exhibit the Manitou in its true colours to many passing
visitors. Elsie tried it, and found she could ride on it with ease.
She wished she had one of her own. A bright idea struck me. In fear
and trembling, I wrote, suggesting to Mr. Hitchcock that I had a
girl friend from England stopping with me in Switzerland, and that
two Manitous would surely be better than one as an
adver<i>tize</i>ment. I confess I stood aghast at my own cheek; but
my hand, I fear, was rapidly growing 'subdued to that it worked
in.' Anyhow I sent the letter off, and waited developments.</p>
<p>By return of post came an answer from my American.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>'<span class="smcap">Dear Miss</span>&mdash;By rail herewith
please receive one lady's No. 4 automatic quadruple-geared
self-feeding Manitou, as per your esteemed favour of July 27th, for
which I desire to thank you. The more I see of your way of doing
business, the more I do admire at you. This is an elegant poster!
Two high-toned English ladies, mounted on Manitous, careering up
the Alps, represent to both of us quite a mint of money. The mutual
benefit, to me, to you, and to the other lady, ought to be simply
incalculable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id=
"Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>. I shall be pleased at any time to
hear of any further developments of your very remarkable
advertising skill, and I am obliged to you for this brilliant
suggestion you have been good enough to make to
me.&mdash;Respectfully,</p>

<p>'What? Am I to have it for nothing, Brownie?' Elsie exclaimed,
bewildered, when I read the letter to her.</p>
<p>I assumed the airs of a woman of the world. 'Why, certainly, my
dear,' I answered, as if I always expected to find bicycles
showered upon me. 'It's a mutual arrangement. Benefits him;
benefits you. Reciprocity is the groundwork of business. <i>He</i>
gets the advertisement; <i>you</i> get the amusement. It's a form
of handbill. Like the ladies who exhibit their back hair, don't you
know, in that window in Regent Street.'</p>
<p>Thus inexpensively mounted, we scoured the country together, up
the steepest hills between Stanzstadt and Meiringen. We had lots of
nibbles. One lady in particular often stopped to look on and admire
the Manitou. She was a nice-looking widow of forty-five, very fresh
and round-faced; a Mrs. Evelegh, we soon found out, who owned a
charming <i>chalet</i> on the hills above Lungern. She spoke to us
more than once: 'What a perfect dear of a machine!' she cried. 'I
wonder if I dare try it!'</p>
<p>'Can you cycle?' I asked.</p>
<p>'I could once,' she answered. 'I was awfully fond of it. But Dr.
Fortescue-Langley won't let me any longer.'</p>
<p>'Try it!' I said dismounting. She got up and rode. 'Oh, isn't it
just lovely!' she cried ecstatically.</p>
<p>'Buy one!' I put in. 'They're as smooth as silk; they cost only
twenty pounds; and, on every machine I sell, I get five pounds
commission.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id=
"Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>
<p>'I should love to,' she answered; 'but Dr.
Fortescue-Langley&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Who is he?' I asked. 'I don't believe in drug-drenchers.'</p>
<p>She looked quite shocked. 'Oh, he's not that kind, you know,'
she put in, breathlessly. 'He's the celebrated esoteric
faith-healer. He won't let me move far away from Lungern, though
I'm longing to be off to England again for the summer. My boy's at
Portsmouth.'</p>
<p>'Then, why don't you disobey him?'</p>
<p>Her face was a study. 'I daren't,' she answered in an awe-struck
voice. 'He comes here every summer; and he does me <i>so</i> much
good, you know. He diagnoses my inner self. He treats me
psychically. When my inner self goes wrong, my bangle turns dusky.'
She held up her right hand with an Indian silver bangle on it; and
sure enough, it was tarnished with a very thin black deposit. 'My
soul is ailing now,' she said in a comically serious voice. 'But it
is seldom so in Switzerland. The moment I land in England the
bangle turns black and remains black till I get back to Lucerne
again.'</p>
<p>When she had gone, I said to Elsie, 'That <i>is</i> odd about
the bangle. State of health might affect it, I suppose. Though it
looks to me like a surface deposit of sulphide.' I knew nothing of
chemistry, I admit; but I had sometimes messed about in the
laboratory at college with some of the other girls; and I
remembered now that sulphide of silver was a blackish-looking body,
like the film on the bangle.</p>
<p>However, at the time I thought no more about it.</p>

title=""> <span class="caption">SHE INVITED ELSIE AND MYSELF TO
STOP WITH HER.</span></div>
<p>By dint of stopping and talking, we soon got quite intimate with
Mrs. Evelegh. As always happens, I found out I had known some of
her cousins in Edinburgh, where I always spent my holidays while I
was at Girton. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id=
"Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> took an interest in what she was
kind enough to call my originality; and before a fortnight was out,
our hotel being uncomfortably crowded, she had invited Elsie and
myself to stop with her at the <i>chalet</i>. We went, and found it
a delightful little home. Mrs. Evelegh was charming; but we could
see at every turn that Dr. Fortescue-Langley had acquired a firm
hold over her. 'He's so clever, you know,' she said; 'and so
spiritual! He exercises such strong odylic force. He binds my being
together. If he misses a visit, I feel my inner self goes all to
pieces.'</p>
<p>'Does he come often?' I asked, growing interested.</p>
<p>'Oh, dear, no,' she answered. 'I wish he did: it
would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg
104]</a></span> be ever so good for me. But he's so much run after;
I am but one among many. He lives at Ch&acirc;teau d'Oex, and comes
across to see patients in this district once a fortnight. It is a
privilege to be attended by an intuitive seer like Dr.
Fortescue-Langley.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Evelegh was rich&mdash;'left comfortably,' as the phrase
goes, but with a clause which prevented her marrying again without
losing her fortune; and I could gather from various hints that Dr.
Fortescue-Langley, whoever he might be, was bleeding her to some
tune, using her soul and her inner self as his financial lancet. I
also noticed that what she said about the bangle was strictly true;
generally bright as a new pin, on certain mornings it was
completely blackened. I had been at the <i>chalet</i> ten days,
however, before I began to suspect the real reason. Then it dawned
upon me one morning in a flash of inspiration. The evening before
had been cold, for at the height where we were perched, even in
August, we often found the temperature chilly in the night, and I
heard Mrs. Evelegh tell C&eacute;cile, her maid, to fill the
hot-water bottle. It was a small point, but it somehow went home to
me. Next day the bangle was black, and Mrs. Evelegh lamented that
her inner self must be suffering from an attack of evil
vapours.</p>
<p>I held my peace at the time, but I asked C&eacute;cile a little
later to bring me that hot-water-bottle. As I more than half
suspected, it was made of india-rubber, wrapped carefully up in the
usual red flannel bag. 'Lend me your brooch, Elsie,' I said. 'I
want to try a little experiment.'</p>
<p>'Won't a franc do as well?' Elsie asked, tendering one. 'That's
equally silver.'</p>
<p>'I think not,' I answered. 'A franc is most likely too hard; it
has base metal to alloy it. But I will vary the experiment by
trying both together. Your brooch is Indian<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> and
therefore soft silver. The native jewellers never use alloy. Hand
it over; it will clean with a little plate-powder, if necessary.
I'm going to see what blackens Mrs. Evelegh's bangle.'</p>
<p>I laid the franc and the brooch on the bottle, filled with hot
water, and placed them for warmth in the fold of a blanket. After
<i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i>, we inspected them. As I anticipated,
the brooch had grown black on the surface with a thin iridescent
layer of silver sulphide, while the franc had hardly suffered at
all from the exposure.</p>
<p>I called in Mrs. Evelegh, and explained what I had done. She was
astonished and half incredulous. 'How could you ever think of it?'
she cried, admiringly.</p>
<p>'Why, I was reading an article yesterday about india-rubber in
one of your magazines,' I answered; 'and the person who wrote it
said the raw gum was hardened for vulcanising by mixing it with
sulphur. When I heard you ask C&eacute;cile for the
hot-water-bottle, I thought at once: "The sulphur and the heat
account for the tarnishing of Mrs. Evelegh's bangle."'</p>
<p>'And the franc doesn't tarnish! Then that must be why my other
silver bracelet, which is English make, and harder, never changes
colour! And Dr. Fortescue-Langley assured me it was because the
soft one was of Indian metal, and had mystic symbols on
it&mdash;symbols that answered to the cardinal moods of my
sub-conscious self, and that darkened in sympathy.'</p>
<p>I jumped at a clue. 'He talked about your sub-conscious self?' I
broke in.</p>
<p>'Yes,' she answered. 'He always does. It's the key-note of his
system. He heals by that alone. But, my dear, after this, how can I
ever believe in him?'</p>
<p>'Does he know about the hot-water-bottle?' I asked.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>'Oh, yes; he ordered me to use it on certain nights; and when I
go to England he says I must never be without one. I see now that
was why my inner self invariably went wrong in England. It was all
just the sulphur blackening the bangles.'</p>
<p>I reflected. 'A middle-aged man?' I asked. 'Stout,
diplomatic-looking, with wrinkles round his eyes, and a
distinguished grey moustache, twirled up oddly at the corners?'</p>
<p>'That's the man, my dear! His very picture. Where on earth have
you seen him?'</p>
<p>'And he talks of sub-conscious selves?' I went on.</p>
<p>'He practises on that basis. He says it's no use prescribing for
the outer man; to do that is to treat mere symptoms: the
sub-conscious self is the inner seat of diseases.'</p>
<p>'How long has he been in Switzerland?'</p>
<p>'Oh, he comes here every year. He arrived this season late in
May, I fancy.'</p>
<p>'When will he visit you again, Mrs. Evelegh?'</p>
<p>'To-morrow morning.'</p>
<p>I made up my mind at once. 'Then I must see him, without being
seen,' I said. 'I think I know him. He is our Count, I believe.'
For I had told Mrs. Evelegh and Elsie the queer story of my journey
from London.</p>
<p>'Impossible, my dear! Im-possible! I have implicit faith in
him!'</p>
<p>'Wait and see, Mrs. Evelegh. You acknowledge he duped you over
the affair of the bangle.'</p>

<p>There are two kinds of dupe: one kind, the commonest, goes on
believing in its deceiver, no matter what happens; the other, far
rarer, has the sense to know it has been deceived if you make the
deception as clear as day to it.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> Mrs. Evelegh was,
fortunately, of the rarer class. Next morning, Dr.
Fortescue-Langley arrived, by appointment. As he walked up the
path, I glanced at him from my window. It was the Count, not a
doubt of it. On his way to gull his dupes in Switzerland, he had
tried to throw in an incidental trifle of a diamond robbery.</p>
<p>I telegraphed the facts at once to Lady Georgina, at<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Schlangenbad. She answered, 'I am coming. Ask the man to meet his
friend on Wednesday.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Evelegh, now almost convinced, invited him. On Wednesday
morning, with a bounce, Lady Georgina burst in upon us. 'My dear,
such a journey!&mdash;alone, at my age&mdash;but there, I haven't
known a happy day since you left me! Oh, yes, I got my
Gretchen&mdash;unsophisticated?&mdash;well&mdash;h'm&mdash;that's
not the word for it: I declare to you, Lois, there isn't a trick of
the trade, in Paris or London&mdash;not a perquisite or a tip that
that girl isn't up to. Comes straight from the remotest recesses of
the Black Forest, and hadn't been with me a week, I assure you,
honour bright, before she was bandolining her yellow hair, and
rouging her cheeks, and wearing my brooches, and wagering gloves
with the hotel waiters upon the Baden races. <i>And</i> her
language: <i>and</i> her manners! Why weren't you born in that
station of life, I wonder, child, so that I might offer you five
hundred a year, and all found, to come and live with me for ever?
But this Gretchen&mdash;her fringe, her shoes, her
ribbons&mdash;upon my soul, my dear, I don't know what girls are
coming to nowadays.'</p>
<p>'Ask Mrs. Lynn-Linton,' I suggested, as she paused. 'She is a
recognised authority on the subject.'</p>
<p>The Cantankerous Old Lady stared at me. 'And this Count?' she
went on. 'So you have really tracked him? You're a wonderful girl,
my dear. I wish you were a lady's maid. You'd be worth me any
money.'</p>
<p>I explained how I had come to hear of Dr. Fortescue-Langley.</p>
<p>Lady Georgina waxed warm. 'Dr. Fortescue-Langley!' she
exclaimed. 'The wicked wretch! But he didn't get my diamonds! I've
carried them here in my hands, all the way from Wiesbaden: I wasn't
going to leave them for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109"
id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> single day to the tender mercies
of that unspeakable Gretchen. The fool would lose them. Well, we'll
catch him this time, Lois: and we'll give him ten years for
it!'</p>
<p>'Ten years!' Mrs. Evelegh cried, clasping her hands in horror.
'Oh, Lady Georgina!'</p>
<p>We waited in Mrs. Evelegh's dining-room, the old lady and I,
behind the folding doors. At three precisely Dr. Fortescue-Langley
walked in. I had difficulty in restraining Lady Georgina from
falling upon him prematurely. He talked a lot of high-flown
nonsense to Mrs. Evelegh and Elsie about the influences of the
planets, and the seventy-five emanations, and the eternal wisdom of
the East, and the medical efficacy of sub-conscious suggestion.
Excellent patter, all of it&mdash;quite as good in its way as the
diplomatic patter he had poured forth in the train to Lady
Georgina. It was rich in spheres, in elements, in cosmic forces. At
last, as he was discussing the reciprocal action of the inner self
upon the exhalations of the lungs, we pushed back the door and
walked calmly in upon him.</p>
<p>His breath came and went. The exhalations of the lungs showed
visible perturbation. He rose and stared at us. For a second he
lost his composure. Then, as bold as brass, he turned, with a
cunning smile, to Mrs. Evelegh. 'Where on earth did you pick up
such acquaintances?' he inquired, in a well-simulated tone of
surprise. 'Yes, Lady Georgina, I have met you before, I admit;
but&mdash;it can hardly be agreeable to you to reflect under what
circumstances.'</p>
<p>Lady Georgina was beside herself. 'You dare?' she cried,
confronting him. 'You dare to brazen it out? You miserable sneak!
But you can't bluff me now. I have the police outside.' Which I
regret to confess was a light-hearted fiction.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p>'The police?' he echoed, drawing back. I could see he was
frightened.</p>
<p>I had an inspiration again. 'Take off that moustache!' I said,
calmly, in my most commanding voice.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 429px;"><a name="ILL_028" id=

height="500" alt=

<span class="caption">I THOUGHT IT KINDER TO HIM TO REMOVE IT
ALTOGETHER.</span></div>
<p>He clapped his hand to it in horror. In his agitation, he
managed to pull it a little bit awry. It looked so absurd, hanging
there, all crooked, that I thought it kinder to him<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> to
remove it altogether. The thing peeled off with difficulty; for it
was a work of art, very firmly and gracefully fastened with
sticking-plaster. But it peeled off at last&mdash;and with it the
whole of the Count's and Dr. Fortescue-Langley's distinction. The
man stood revealed, a very palpable man-servant.</p>
<p>Lady Georgina stared hard at him. 'Where have I seen you
before?' she murmured, slowly. 'That face is familiar to me. Why,
yes; you went once to Italy as Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst's courier! I
know you now. Your name is Higginson.'</p>
<p>It was a come-down for the Comte de Laroche-sur-Loiret, but he
swallowed it like a man at a single gulp.</p>
<p>'Yes, my lady,' he said, fingering his hat nervously, now all
was up. 'You are quite right, my lady. But what would you have me
do? Times are hard on us couriers. Nobody wants us now. I must take
to what I can.' He assumed once more the tone of the Vienna
diplomat. '<i>Que voulez-vous</i>, madame? These are revolutionary
days. A man of intelligence must move with the Zeitgeist!'</p>
<p>Lady Georgina burst into a loud laugh. 'And to think,' she
cried, 'that I talked to this lackey from London to Malines without
ever suspecting him! Higginson, you're a fraud&mdash;but you're a
precious clever one.'</p>
<p>He bowed. 'I am happy to have merited Lady Georgina Fawley's
commendation,' he answered, with his palm on his heart, in his
grandiose manner.</p>
<p>'But I shall hand you over to the police all the same! You are a
thief and a swindler!'</p>
<p>He assumed a comic expression. 'Unhappily, not a thief,' he
objected. 'This young lady prevented me from appropriating your
diamonds. <i>Convey</i>, the wise call it. I wanted to take your
jewel-case&mdash;and she put me off with<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> a
sandwich-tin. I wanted to make an honest penny out of Mrs. Evelegh;
and&mdash;she confronts me with your ladyship, and tears my
moustache off.'</p>
<p>Lady Georgina regarded him with a hesitating expression. 'But I
shall call the police,' she said, wavering visibly.</p>
<p>'<i>De grace</i>, my lady, <i>de grace</i>! Is it worth while,
<i>pour si peu de chose</i>? Consider, I have really effected
nothing. Will you charge me with having taken&mdash;in
error&mdash;a small tin sandwich-case&mdash;value, elevenpence? An
affair of a week's imprisonment. That is positively all you can
bring up against me. And,' brightening up visibly, 'I have the case
still; I will return it to-morrow with pleasure to your
ladyship!'</p>
<p>'But the india-rubber water-bottle?' I put in. 'You have been
deceiving Mrs. Evelegh. It blackens silver. And you told her lies
in order to extort money under false pretences.'</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders. 'You are too clever for me, young
lady,' he broke out. 'I have nothing to say to you. But Lady
Georgina, Mrs. Evelegh&mdash;you are human&mdash;let me go!
Reflect; I have things I could tell that would make both of you
look ridiculous. That journey to Malines, Lady Georgina! Those
Indian charms, Mrs. Evelegh! Besides, you have spoiled my game. Let
that suffice you! I can practise in Switzerland no longer. Allow me
to go in peace, and I will try once more to be indifferent
honest!'</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"><a name="ILL_029" id=

<span class="caption">INCH BY INCH HE RETREATED.</span></div>
<p>He backed slowly towards the door, with his eyes fixed on them.
I stood by and waited. Inch by inch he retreated. Lady Georgina
looked down abstractedly at the carpet. Mrs. Evelegh looked up
abstractedly at the ceiling. Neither spoke another word. The rogue
backed out by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id=
"Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> degrees. Then he sprang downstairs,
and before they could decide was well out into the
open.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg
114]</a></span></p>
<p>Lady Georgina was the first to break the silence. 'After all, my
dear,' she murmured, turning to me, 'there was a deal of sound
English common-sense about Dogberry!'</p>
<p>I remembered then his charge to the watch to apprehend a rogue.
'How if 'a will not stand?'</p>
<p>'Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and presently
call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a
knave.' When I remembered how Lady Georgina had hob-nobbed with the
Count from Ostend to Malines, I agreed to a great extent both with
her and with Dogberry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id=

<h3>THE ADVENTURE OF THE IMPROMPTU MOUNTAINEER</h3>
<p>The explosion and evaporation of Dr. Fortescue-Langley (with
whom were amalgamated the Comte de Laroche-sur-Loiret, Mr.
Higginson the courier, and whatever else that versatile gentleman
chose to call himself) entailed many results of varying
magnitudes.</p>
<p>In the first place, Mrs. Evelegh ordered a Great Manitou. That,
however, mattered little to 'the firm,' as I loved to call us
(because it shocked dear Elsie so); for, of course, after all her
kindness we couldn't accept our commission on her purchase, so that
she got her machine cheap for &pound;15 from the maker. But, in the
second place&mdash;I declare I am beginning to write like a woman
of business&mdash;she decided to run over to England for the summer
to see her boy at Portsmouth, being certain now that the
discoloration of her bangle depended more on the presence of
sulphur in the india-rubber bottle than on the passing state of her
astral body. 'Tis an abrupt descent from the inner self to a
hot-water bottle, I admit; but Mrs. Evelegh took the plunge with
grace, like a sensible woman. Dr. Fortescue-Langley had been
annihilated for her at one blow: she returned forthwith to
common-sense and England.</p>
<p>'What will you do with the <i>chalet</i> while you're
away?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg
116]</a></span> Lady Georgina asked, when she announced her
intention. 'You can't shut it up to take care of itself. Every
blessed thing in the place will go to rack and ruin. Shutting up a
house means spoiling it for ever. Why, I've got a cottage of my own
that I let for the summer in the best part of Surrey&mdash;a pretty
little place, now vacant, for which, by the way, I want a tenant,
if you happen to know of one: and when it's left empty for a month
or two&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Perhaps it would do for me?' Mrs. Evelegh suggested, jumping at
it. 'I'm looking out for a furnished house for the summer, within
easy reach of Portsmouth and London, for myself and Oliver.'</p>
<p>Lady Georgina seized her arm, with a face of blank horror. 'My
dear,' she cried. 'For you! I wouldn't dream of letting it to you.
A nasty, damp, cold, unwholesome house, on stiff clay soil, with
detestable drains, in the deadliest part of the Weald of
Surrey,&mdash;why, you and your boy would catch your deaths of
rheumatism.'</p>
<p>'Is it the one I saw advertised in the <i>Times</i> this
morning, I wonder?' Mrs. Evelegh inquired in a placid voice.
'"Charming furnished house on Holmesdale Common; six bedrooms, four
reception-rooms; splendid views; pure air; picturesque
surroundings; exceptionally situated." I thought of writing about
it.'</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;"><a name="ILL_030" id=

height="474" alt="NEVER LEAVE A HOUSE TO THE SERVANTS, MY DEAR!"
title=""> <span class="caption">NEVER LEAVE A HOUSE TO THE
SERVANTS, MY DEAR!</span></div>
<p>'That's it!' Lady Georgina exclaimed, with a demonstrative wave
of her hand. 'I drew up the advertisement myself. Exceptionally
situated! I should just think it was! Why, my dear, I wouldn't let
you rent the place for worlds; a horrid, poky little hole, stuck
down in the bottom of a boggy hollow, as damp as Devonshire, with
the paper peeling off the walls, so that I had to take my choice
between giving it up myself ten years ago, or removing to the
cemetery; and I've let it ever since to City men with large
families.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg
117]</a></span> Nothing would induce me to allow you and your boy
to expose yourself to such risks.' For Lady Georgina had taken
quite a fancy to Mrs. Evelegh. 'But what I was just going to say
was this: you can't shut your house up; it'll all go mouldy. Houses
always go mouldy, shut up in summer. And you can't leave it to your
servants; <i>I</i> know the baggages; no conscience&mdash;no
conscience; they'll ask their entire families to come and stop with
them <i>en bloc</i>, and turn your place into a perfect piggery.
Why, when I went away from my house in town one autumn, didn't I
leave a policeman and his wife in charge&mdash;a most respectable
man&mdash;only he happened to be an Irishman. And what was the
consequence? My dear, I assure you, I came back unexpectedly from
poor dear Kynaston's one day&mdash;at a moment's
notice&mdash;having quarrelled with him over Home Rule or Education
or something&mdash;poor dear Kynaston's what they call a Liberal, I
believe&mdash;got at by that man Rosebery&mdash;and there didn't I
find all the O'Flanagans, and O'Flahertys, and O'Flynns in the
neighbourhood camping out in my drawing-room; with a strong
detachment of O'Donohues, and O'Dohertys, and O'Driscolls lying
around loose in possession of the library? Never leave a house to
the servants, my dear! It's positively suicidal. Put in a
responsible caretaker of whom you know something&mdash;like Lois
here, for instance.'</p>
<p>'Lois!' Mrs. Evelegh echoed. 'Dear me, that's just the very
thing. What a capital idea! I never thought of Lois! She and Elsie
might stop on here, with Ursula and the gardener.'</p>
<p>I protested that if we did it was our clear duty to pay a small
rent; but Mrs. Evelegh brushed that aside. 'You've robbed
yourselves over the bicycle,' she insisted, 'and I'm delighted to
let you have it. It's I who ought to pay, for you'll keep the house
dry for me.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id=
"Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>
<p>I remembered Mr. Hitchcock&mdash;'Mutual advantage: benefits
you, benefits me'&mdash;and made no bones about it. So in the end
Mrs. Evelegh set off for England with C&eacute;cile, leaving Elsie
and me in charge of Ursula, the gardener, and the
<i>chalet</i>.</p>
<p>As for Lady Georgina, having by this time completed her 'cure'
at Schlangenbad (complexion as usual; no guinea yellower), she
telegraphed for Gretchen&mdash;'I can't do without the
idiot'&mdash;and hung round Lucerne, apparently for no other
purpose but to send people up the Br&uuml;nig on the hunt for our
wonderful new machines, and so put money in our pockets. She was
much amused when I told her that Aunt Susan (who lived, you will
remember, in respectable indigence at Blackheath)<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> had
written to expostulate with me on my 'unladylike' conduct in
becoming a bicycle commission agent. 'Unladylike!&mdash;the
Cantankerous Old Lady exclaimed, with warmth. 'What does the woman
mean? Has she got no gumption? It's "ladylike," I suppose, to be a
companion, or a governess, or a music-teacher, or something else in
the black-thread-glove way, in London; but not to sell bicycles for
a good round commission. My dear, between you and me, I don't see
it. If you had a brother, now, <i>he</i> might sell cycles, or
corner wheat, or rig the share market, or do anything else he
pleased, in these days, and nobody'd think the worse of
him&mdash;as long as he made money; and it's my opinion that what
is sauce for the goose can't be far out for the gander&mdash;and
<i>vice-vers&acirc;</i>. Besides which, what's the use of
<i>trying</i> to be ladylike? You <i>are</i> a lady, child, and you
couldn't help being one; why trouble to be <i>like</i> what nature
made you? Tell Aunt Susan from me to put <i>that</i> in her pipe
and smoke it!'</p>
<p>I <i>did</i> tell Aunt Susan by letter, giving Lady Georgina's
authority for the statement; and I really believe it had a
consoling effect upon her; for Aunt Susan is one of those
innocent-minded people who cherish a profound respect for the
opinions and ideas of a Lady of Title. Especially where questions
of delicacy are concerned. It calmed her to think that though I, an
officer's daughter, had declined upon trade, I was mixing at least
with the Best People!</p>
<p>We had a lovely time at the <i>chalet</i>&mdash;two girls alone,
messing just as we pleased in the kitchen, and learning from Ursula
how to concoct <i>pot-au-feu</i> in the most approved Swiss
fashion. We pottered, as we women love to potter, half the day
long; the other half we spent in riding our cycles about the
eternal hills, and ensnaring the flies whom Lady Georgina dutifully
sent up to us. She was our decoy duck: and, in virtue of her
handle, she decoyed to a marvel. Indeed, I<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> sold
so many Manitous that I began to entertain a deep respect for my
own commercial faculties. As for Mr. Cyrus W. Hitchcock, he wrote
to me from Frankfort: 'The world continues to revolve on its axis,
the Manitou, and the machine is booming. Orders romp in daily. When
you ventilated the suggestion of an agency at Limburg, I concluded
at a glance you had the material of a first-class business woman
about you; but I reckon I did not know what a traveller meant till
you started on the road. I am now enlarging and altering this
factory, to meet increased demands. Branch offices at Berlin,
Hamburg, Crefeld, and D&uuml;sseldorf. Inspect our stock before
dealing elsewhere. A liberal discount allowed to the trade. Two
hundred agents wanted in all towns of Germany. If they were every
one of them like <i>you</i>, miss&mdash;well, I guess I would hire
the town of Frankfort for my business premises.'</p>
<p>One morning, after we had spent about a week at the
<i>chalet</i> by ourselves, I was surprised to see a young man with
a knapsack on his back walking up the garden path towards our
cottage. 'Quick, quick, Elsie!' I cried, being in a mischievous
mood. 'Come here with the opera-glass! There's a Man in the
offing!'</p>
<p>'A <i>what</i>?' Elsie exclaimed, shocked as usual at my
levity.</p>
<p>'A Man,' I answered, squeezing her arm. 'A Man! A real live Man!
A specimen of the masculine gender in the human being! Man, ahoy!
He has come at last&mdash;the lodestar of our existence!'</p>
<p>Next minute, I was sorry I spoke; for as the man drew nearer, I
perceived that he was endowed with very long legs and a languidly
poetical bearing. That supercilious smile&mdash;that enticing
moustache! Could it be?&mdash;yes, it was&mdash;not a doubt of
it&mdash;Harold Tillington!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121"
id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<p>I grew grave at once; Harold Tillington and the situation were
serious. 'What can he want here?' I exclaimed, drawing back.</p>
<p>'Who is it?' Elsie asked; for, being a woman, she read at once
in my altered demeanour the fact that the Man was not unknown to
me.</p>
<p>'Lady Georgina's nephew,' I answered, with a tell-tale cheek, I
fear. 'You remember I mentioned to you that I had met him at
Schlangenbad. But this is really too bad of that wicked old Lady
Georgina. She has told him where we lived and sent him up to see
us.'</p>
<p>'Perhaps,' Elsie put in, 'he wants to charter a bicycle.'</p>
<p>I glanced at Elsie sideways. I had an uncomfortable suspicion
that she said it slyly, like one who knew he wanted nothing of the
sort. But at any rate, I brushed the suggestion aside frankly.
'Nonsense,' I answered. 'He wants <i>me</i>, not a bicycle.'</p>
<p>He came up to us, waving his hat. He <i>did</i> look handsome!
'Well, Miss Cayley,' he cried from afar, 'I have tracked you to
your lair! I have found out where you abide! What a beautiful spot!
And how well you're looking!'</p>
<p>'This is an unexpected&mdash;&mdash;' I paused. He thought I was
going to say, 'pleasure,' but I finished it, 'intrusion.' His face
fell. 'How did you know we were at Lungern, Mr. Tillington?'</p>
<p>'My respected relative,' he answered, laughing. 'She
mentioned&mdash;casually&mdash;' his eyes met mine&mdash;'that you
were stopping in a <i>chalet</i>. And as I was on my way back to
the diplomatic mill, I thought I might just as well walk over the
Grimsel and the Furca, and then on to the Gotthard. The Court is at
Monza. So it occurred to me ... that in passing ... I might venture
to drop in and say how-do-you-do to you.'<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>
<p>'Thank you,' I answered, severely&mdash;but my heart spoke
otherwise&mdash;'I do very well. And you, Mr. Tillington?'</p>
<p>'Badly,' he echoed. 'Badly, since <i>you</i> went away from
Schlangenbad.'</p>
<p>I gazed at his dusty feet. 'You are tramping,' I said, cruelly.
'I suppose you will get forward for lunch to Meiringen?'</p>
<p>'I&mdash; I did not contemplate it.'</p>
<p>'Indeed?'</p>
<p>He grew bolder. 'No; to say the truth, I half hoped I might stop
and spend the day here with you.'</p>
<p>'Elsie,' I remarked firmly, 'if Mr. Tillington persists in
planting himself upon us like this, one of us must go and
investigate the kitchen department.'</p>
<p>Elsie rose like a lamb. I have an impression that she gathered
we wanted to be left alone.</p>

<p>He turned to me imploringly. 'Lois,' he cried, stretching out
his arms, with an appealing air, 'I <i>may</i> stay, mayn't I?'</p>
<p>I tried to be stern; but I fear 'twas a feeble pretence. 'We are
two girls, alone in a house,' I answered. 'Lady Georgina, as a
matron of experience, ought to have protected us. Merely to give
you lunch is almost irregular. (Good diplomatic word, irregular.)
Still, in these days, I suppose you <i>may</i> stay, if you leave
early in the afternoon. That's the utmost I can do for you.'</p>
<p>'You are not gracious,' he cried, gazing at me with a wistful
look.</p>
<p>I did not dare to be gracious. 'Uninvited guests must not
quarrel with their welcome,' I answered severely. Then the woman in
me broke forth. 'But indeed, Mr. Tillington, I am glad to see
you.'</p>
<p>He leaned forward eagerly. 'So you are not angry with me, Lois?
I may call you <i>Lois</i>?'<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<p>I trembled and hesitated. 'I am not angry with you. I&mdash; I
like you too much to be ever angry with you. And I am glad you
came&mdash;just this once&mdash;to see me.... Yes,&mdash;when we
are alone&mdash;you may call me Lois.'</p>
<p>He tried to seize my hand. I withdrew it. 'Then I may perhaps
hope,' he began, 'that some day&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>I shook my head. 'No, no,' I said, regretfully. 'You<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
misunderstand me. I like you very much; and I like to see you. But
as long as you are rich and have prospects like yours, I could
never marry you. My pride wouldn't let me. Take that as final.'</p>
<p>I looked away. He bent forward again. 'But if I were poor?' he
put in, eagerly.</p>
<p>I hesitated. Then my heart rose, and I gave way. 'If ever you
are poor,' I faltered,&mdash;'penniless, hunted,
friendless&mdash;come to me, Harold, and I will help and comfort
you. But not till then. Not till then, I implore you.'</p>
<p>He leant back and clasped his hands. 'You have given me
something to live for, dear Lois,' he murmured. 'I will try to be
poor&mdash;penniless, hunted, friendless. To win you I will try.
And when that day arrives, I shall come to claim you.'</p>
<p>We sat for an hour and had a delicious talk&mdash;about nothing.
But we understood each other. Only that artificial barrier divided
us. At the end of the hour, I heard Elsie coming back by
judiciously slow stages from the kitchen to the living-room,
through six feet of passage, discoursing audibly to Ursula all the
way, with a tardiness that did honour to her heart and her
understanding. Dear, kind little Elsie! I believe she had never a
tiny romance of her own; yet her sympathy for others was sweet to
look upon.</p>
<p>We lunched at a small deal table in the veranda. Around us rose
the pinnacles. The scent of pines and moist moss was in the air.
Elsie had arranged the flowers, and got ready the omelette, and
cooked the chicken cutlets, and prepared the junket. 'I never
thought I could do it alone without you, Brownie; but I tried, and
it all came right by magic, somehow.' We laughed and talked
incessantly. Harold was in excellent cue; and Elsie took to him. A
livelier or merrier table there wasn't in the
twenty-two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id=
"Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> Cantons that day than ours, under
the sapphire sky, looking out on the sun-smitten snows of the
Jungfrau.</p>
<p>After lunch, Harold begged hard to be allowed to stop for tea. I
had misgivings, but I gave way&mdash;he <i>was</i> such good
company. One may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb, says the
wisdom of our ancestors: and, after all, Mrs. Grundy was only
represented here by Elsie, the gentlest and least censorious of her
daughters. So he stopped and chatted till four; when I made tea and
insisted on dismissing him. He meant to take the rough mountain
path over the screes from Lungern to Meiringen, which ran right
behind the <i>chalet</i>. I feared lest he might be belated, and
urged him to hurry.</p>
<p>'Thanks, I'm happier here,' he answered.</p>
<p>I was sternness itself. 'You <i>promised</i> me!' I said, in a
reproachful voice.</p>
<p>He rose instantly, and bowed. 'Your will is law&mdash;even when
it pronounces sentence of exile.'</p>
<p>Would we walk a little way with him? No, I faltered; we would
not. We would follow him with the opera-glasses and wave him
farewell when he reached the Kulm. He shook our hands unwillingly,
and turned up the little path, looking handsomer than ever. It led
ascending through a fir-wood to the rock-strewn hillside.</p>
<p>Once, a quarter of an hour later, we caught a glimpse of him
near a sharp turn in the road; after that we waited in vain, with
our eyes fixed on the Kulm; not a sign could we discern of him. At
last I grew anxious. 'He ought to be there,' I cried, fuming.</p>
<p>'He ought,' Elsie answered.</p>
<p>I swept the slopes with the opera-glasses. Anxiety and interest
in him quickened my senses, I suppose. 'Look here, Elsie,' I burst
out at last. 'Just take this glass and<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> have
a glance at those birds, down the crag below the Kulm. Don't they
seem to be circling and behaving most oddly?'</p>
<p>Elsie gazed where I bid her. 'They're wheeling round and round,'
she answered, after a minute; 'and they certainly <i>do</i> look as
if they were screaming.'</p>
<p>'They seem to be frightened,' I suggested.</p>
<p>'It looks like it, Brownie,'</p>
<p>'Then he's fallen over a precipice!' I cried, rising up; 'and
he's lying there on a ledge by their nest. Elsie, we must go to
him!'</p>
<p>She clasped her hands and looked terrified. 'Oh, Brownie, how
dreadful!' she exclaimed. Her face was deadly white. Mine burned
like fire.</p>
<p>'Not a moment to lose!' I said, holding my breath. 'Get out the
rope and let us run to him!'</p>
<p>'Don't you think,' Elsie suggested, 'we had better hurry down on
our cycles to Lungern and call some men from the village to help
us? We are two girls, and alone. What can we do to aid him?'</p>
<p>'No,' I answered, promptly, 'that won't do. It would only lose
time&mdash;and time may be precious. You and I must go; I'll send
Ursula off to bring up guides from the village.'</p>
<p>Fortunately, we had a good long coil of new rope in the house,
which Mrs. Evelegh had provided in case of accident. I slipped it
on my arm, and set out on foot; for the path was by far too rough
for cycles. I was sorry afterwards that I had not taken Ursula, and
sent Elsie to Lungern to rouse the men; for she found the climbing
hard, and I had difficulty at times in dragging her up the steep
and stony pathway, almost a watercourse. However, we persisted in
the direction of the Kulm, tracking Harold by his footprints; for
he wore mountain boots with sharp-headed nails, which<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> made
dints in the moist soil, and scratched the smooth surface of the
rock where he trod on it.</p>
<p>We followed him thus for a mile or two, along the regular path;
then of a sudden, in an open part, the trail failed us. I turned
back, a few yards, and looked close, with my eyes fixed on the
spongy soil, as keen as a hound that sniffs his way after his
quarry. 'He went off <i>here</i>, Elsie!' I said at last, pulling
up short by a spindle bush on the hillside.</p>
<p>'How do you know, Brownie?'</p>
<p>'Why, see, there are the marks of his stick; he had a thick one,
you remember, with a square iron spike. These are its dints; I have
been watching them all the way along from the <i>chalet</i>!</p>
<p>'But there are so many such marks!'</p>
<p>'Yes, I know; I can tell his from the older ones made by the
spikes of alpenstocks because Harold's are fresher and sharper on
the edge. They look so much newer. See, here, he slipped on the
rock; you can know that scratch is recent by the clean way it's
traced, and the little glistening crystals still left behind in it.
Those other marks have been wind-swept and washed by the rain.
There are no broken particles.'</p>
<p>'How on earth did you find that out, Brownie?'</p>
<p>How on earth did I find it out! I wondered myself. But the
emergency seemed somehow to teach me something of the instinctive
lore of hunters and savages. I did not trouble to answer her. 'At
this bush, the tracks fail,' I went on; 'and, look, he must have
clutched at that branch and crushed the broken leaves as the twigs
slipped through his fingers. He left the path here, then, and
struck off on a short cut of his own along the hillside, lower
down. Elsie, we must follow him.'</p>
<p>She shrank from it; but I held her hand. It was a<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> more
difficult task to track him now; for we had no longer the path to
guide us. However, I explored the ground on my hands and knees, and
soon found marks of footsteps on the boggy patches, with scratches
on the rock where he had leapt from point to point, or planted his
stick to steady himself. I tried to help Elsie along among the
littered boulders and the dwarf growth of wind-swept daphne: but,
poor child, it was too much for her: she sat down after a few
minutes upon the flat juniper scrub and began to cry. What was I to
do? My anxiety was breathless. I couldn't leave her there alone,
and I couldn't forsake Harold. Yet I felt every minute might now be
critical. We were making among wet whortleberry thicket and torn
rock towards the spot where I had seen the birds wheel and circle,
screaming. The only way left was to encourage Elsie and make her
feel the necessity for instant action. 'He is alive still,' I
exclaimed, looking up; 'the birds are crying! If he were dead, they
would return to their nest&mdash; Elsie, we <i>must</i> get to
him!'</p>
<p>She rose, bewildered, and followed me. I held her hand tight,
and coaxed her to scramble over the rocks where the scratches
showed the way, or to clamber at times over fallen trunks of huge
fir-trees. Yet it was hard work climbing; even Harold's sure feet
had slipped often on the wet and slimy boulders, though, like most
of Queen Margherita's set, he was an expert mountaineer. Then, at
times, I lost the faint track, so that I had to diverge and look
close to find it. These delays fretted me. 'See, a stone loosed
from its bed&mdash;he must have passed by here.... That twig is
newly snapped; no doubt he caught at it.... Ha, the moss there has
been crushed; a foot has gone by. And the ants on that ant-hill,
with their eggs in their mouths&mdash;a man's tread has frightened
them.' So, by some instinctive sense, as if the spirit of my savage
ancestors revived within me, I<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> managed to recover the
spoor again and again by a miracle, till at last, round a corner by
a defiant cliff&mdash;with a terrible foreboding, my heart stood
still within me.</p>
<p>We had come to an end. A great projecting buttress of crag rose
sheer in front. Above lay loose boulders. Below was a shrub-hung
precipice. The birds we had seen from home were still circling and
screaming.</p>
<p>They were a pair of peregrine hawks. Their nest seemed to lie
far below the broken scar, some sixty or seventy feet beneath
us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg
130]</a></span></p>
<p>'He is not dead!' I cried once more, with my heart in my mouth.
'If he were, they would have returned. He has fallen, and is lying,
alive, below there!'</p>

"I ADVANCED ON MY HANDS AND KNEES TO THE EDGE OF THE PRECIPICE."
title=""> <span class="caption">I ADVANCED ON MY HANDS AND KNEES TO
THE EDGE OF THE PRECIPICE.</span></div>
<p>Elsie shrank back against the wall of rock. I advanced on my
hands and knees to the edge of the precipice. It was not quite
sheer, but it dropped like a sea-cliff, with broken ledges.</p>
<p>I could see where Harold had slipped. He had tried to climb
round the crag that blocked the road, and the ground at the edge of
the precipice had given way with him; it showed a recent founder of
a few inches. Then he clutched at a branch of broom as he fell; but
it slipped through his fingers, cutting them; for there was blood
on the wiry stem. I knelt by the side of the cliff and craned my
head over. I scarcely dared to look. In spite of the birds, my
heart misgave me.</p>
<p>There, on a ledge deep below, he lay in a mass, half raised on
one arm. But not dead, I believed. 'Harold!' I cried. 'Harold!'</p>
<p>He turned his face up and saw me; his eyes lighted with joy. He
shouted back something, but I could not hear it.</p>
<p>I turned to Elsie. 'I must go down to him!'</p>
<p>Her tears rose again. 'Oh, Brownie!'</p>
<p>I unwound the coil of rope. The first thing was to fasten it. I
could not trust Elsie to hold it; she was too weak and too
frightened to bear my weight: even if I wound it round her body, I
feared my mere mass might drag her over. I peered about at the
surroundings. No tree grew near; no rock had a pinnacle
sufficiently safe to depend upon. But I found a plan soon. In the
crag behind me was a cleft, narrowing wedge-shape as it descended.
I tied the end of the rope round a stone, a<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> good
big water-worn stone, rudely girdled with a groove near the middle,
which prevented it from slipping; then I dropped it down the
fissure till it jammed; after which, I tried it to see if it would
bear. It was firm as the rock itself. I let the rope down by it,
and waited a moment to discover whether Harold could climb. He
shook his head, and took a notebook with evident pain from his
pocket. Then he scribbled a few words, and pinned them to the rope.
I hauled it up. 'Can't move. Either severely bruised and sprained,
or else legs broken.'</p>
<p>There was no help for it, then. I must go to him.</p>
<p>My first idea was merely to glide down the rope with my gloved
hands, for I chanced to have my dog-skin bicycling gloves in my
pocket. Fortunately, however, I did not carry out this crude idea
too hastily; for next instant it occurred to me that I could not
swarm up again. I have had no practice in rope-climbing. Here was a
problem. But the moment suggested its own solution. I began making
knots, or rather nooses or loops, in the rope, at intervals of
about eighteen inches. 'What are they for?' Elsie asked, looking on
in wonder.</p>
<p>'Footholds, to climb up by.'</p>
<p>'But the ones above will pull out with your weight.'</p>
<p>'I don't think so. Still, to make sure, I shall tie them with
this string. I <i>must</i> get down to him.'</p>
<p>I threaded a sufficient number of loops, trying the length over
the edge. Then I said to Elsie, who sat cowering, propped against
the crag, 'You must come and look over, and do as I wave to you.
Mind, dear, you <i>must</i>! Two lives depend upon it.'</p>
<p>'Brownie, I daren't? I shall turn giddy and fall over!'</p>
<p>I smoothed her golden hair. 'Elsie, dear,' I said gently, gazing
into her blue eyes, 'you are a woman. A woman<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> can
always be brave, where those she loves are concerned; and I believe
you love me.' I led her, coaxingly, to the edge. 'Sit there,' I
said, in my quietest voice, so as not to alarm her. 'You can lie at
full length, if you like, and only just peep over. But when I wave
my hand, remember, you must pull the rope up.'</p>
<p>She obeyed me like a child. I knew she loved me.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 218px;"><a name="ILL_033" id=

height="500" alt="I GRIPPED THE ROPE AND LET MYSELF DOWN." title=
""> <span class="caption">I GRIPPED THE ROPE AND LET MYSELF
DOWN.</span></div>
<p>I gripped the rope and let myself down, not using the loops to
descend, but just sliding with hands and knees, and allowing the
knots to slacken my pace. Half-way down, I will confess, the eerie
feeling of physical suspense was horrible. One hung so in mid-air!
The hawks flapped their wings. But Harold was below; and a woman
can always be brave where those she<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> loves&mdash;well, just
that moment, catching my breath, I knew I loved Harold.</p>
<p>I glided down swiftly. The air whizzed. At last, on a narrow
shelf of rock, I leant over him. He seized my hand. 'I knew you
would come!' he cried. 'I felt sure you would find out. Though,
<i>how</i> you found out, Heaven only knows, you clever, brave
little woman!'</p>
<p>'Are you terribly hurt?' I asked, bending close. His clothes
were torn.</p>
<p>'I hardly know. I can't move. It may only be bruises.'</p>
<p>'Can you climb by these nooses with my help?'</p>
<p>He shook his head. 'Oh, no. I couldn't climb at all. I must be
lifted, somehow. You had better go back to Lungern and bring men to
help you.'</p>
<p>'And leave you here alone! Never, Harold; never!'</p>
<p>'Then what can we do?'</p>
<p>I reflected a moment. 'Lend me your pencil,' I said. He pulled
it out&mdash;his arms were almost unhurt, fortunately. I scribbled
a line to Elsie. 'Tie my plaid to the rope and let it down.' Then I
waved to her to pull up again.</p>
<p>I was half surprised to find she obeyed the signal, for she
crouched there, white-faced and open-mouthed, watching; but I have
often observed that women are almost always brave in the great
emergencies. She pinned on the plaid and let it down with
commendable quickness. I doubled it, and tied firm knots in the
four corners, so as to make it into a sort of basket; then I
fastened it at each corner with a piece of the rope, crossed in the
middle, till it looked like one of the cages they use in mills for
letting down sacks with. As soon as it was finished, I said, 'Now,
just try to crawl into it.'</p>
<p>He raised himself on his arms and crawled in with<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
difficulty. His legs dragged after him. I could see he was in great
pain. But still, he managed it.</p>
<p>I planted my foot in the first noose. 'You must sit still,' I
said, breathless. 'I am going back to haul you up.'</p>
<p>'Are you strong enough, Lois?'</p>
<p>'With Elsie to help me, yes. I often stroked a four at
Girton.'</p>
<p>'I can trust you,' he answered. It thrilled me that he said
so.</p>
<p>I began my hazardous journey; I mounted the rope by the
nooses&mdash;one, two, three, four, counting them as I mounted. I
did not dare to look up or down as I did so, lest I should grow
giddy and fall, but kept my eyes fixed firmly always on the one
noose in front of me. My brain swam: the rope swayed and creaked.
Twenty, thirty, forty! Foot after foot, I slipped them in
mechanically, taking up with me the longer coil whose ends were
attached to the cage and Harold. My hands trembled; it was ghastly,
swinging there between earth and heaven. Forty-five, forty-six,
forty-seven&mdash; I knew there were forty-eight of them. At last,
after some weeks, as it seemed, I reached the summit. Tremulous and
half dead, I prised myself over the edge with my hands, and knelt
once more on the hill beside Elsie.</p>
<p>She was white, but attentive. 'What next, Brownie?' Her voice
quivered.</p>
<p>I looked about me. I was too faint and shaky after my perilous
ascent to be fit for work, but there was no help for it. What could
I use as a pulley? Not a tree grew near; but the stone jammed in
the fissure might once more serve my purpose. I tried it again. It
had borne my weight; was it strong enough to bear the precious
weight of Harold? I tugged at it, and thought so. I passed
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg
135]</a></span> rope round it like a pulley, and then tied it about
my own waist. I had a happy thought: I could use myself as a
windlass. I turned on my feet for a pivot. Elsie helped me to pull.
'Up you go!' I cried, cheerily. We wound slowly, for fear of
shaking him. Bit by bit, I could feel the cage rise gradually from
the ground; its weight, taken so, with living capstan and stone
axle, was less than I should have expected. But the pulley helped
us, and Elsie, spurred by need, put forth more reserve of nervous
strength than I could easily have believed lay in that tiny body. I
twisted myself round and round, close to the edge, so as to look
over from time to time, but not at all quickly, for fear of
dizziness. The rope strained and gave. It was a deadly ten minutes
of suspense and anxiety. Twice or thrice as I looked down I saw a
spasm of pain break over Harold's face; but when I paused and
glanced inquiringly, he motioned me to go on with my venturesome
task. There was no turning back now. We had almost got him up when
the rope at the edge began to creak ominously.</p>
<p>It was straining at the point where it grated against the brink
of the precipice. My heart gave a leap. If the rope broke, all was
over.</p>
<p>With a sudden dart forward, I seized it with my hands, below the
part that gave; then&mdash;one fierce little run back&mdash;and I
brought him level with the edge. He clutched at Elsie's hand. I
turned thrice round, to wind the slack about my body. The taut rope
cut deep into my flesh; but nothing mattered now, except to save
him. 'Catch the cloak, Elsie!' I cried; 'catch it: pull him gently
in!' Elsie caught it and pulled him in, with wonderful pluck and
calmness. We hauled him over the edge. He lay safe on the bank.
Then we all three broke down and cried like children together. I
took his hand in mine and held it in silence.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>
<p>When we found words again I drew a deep breath, and said,
simply, 'How did you manage to do it?'</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 245px;"><a name="ILL_034" id=

height="500" alt="I ROLLED AND SLID DOWN." title=""> <span class=
"caption">I ROLLED AND SLID DOWN.</span></div>
<p>'I tried to clamber past the wall that barred the way there by
sheer force of stride&mdash;you know, my legs are long&mdash;and I
somehow overbalanced myself. But I didn't exactly fall&mdash;if I
had fallen, I must have been killed; I rolled and slid down,
clutching at the weeds in the crannies as I slipped, and stumbling
over the projections, without quite losing my foothold on the
ledges, till I found myself brought up short with a bump at the end
of it.'</p>
<p>'And you think no bones are broken?'</p>
<p>'I can't feel sure. It hurts me horribly to move. I fancy just
at first I must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id=
"Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> have fainted. But I'm inclined to
guess I'm only sprained and bruised and sore all over. Why, you're
as bad as me, I believe. See, your dear hands are all torn and
bleeding!'</p>
<p>'How are we ever to get him back again, Brownie?' Elsie put in.
She was paler than ever now, and prostrate with the after-effects
of her unwonted effort.</p>
<p>'You are a practical woman, Elsie,' I answered. 'Stop with him
here a minute or two. I'll climb up the hillside and halloo for
Ursula and the men from Lungern.'</p>
<p>I climbed and hallooed. In a few minutes, worn out as I was, I
had reached the path above and attracted their attention. They
hurried down to where Harold lay, and, using my cage for a litter,
slung on a young fir-trunk, carried him back between them across
their shoulders to the village. He pleaded hard to be allowed to
remain at the <i>chalet</i>, and Elsie joined her prayers to his;
but, there, I was adamant. It was not so much what people might say
that I minded, but a deeper difficulty. For if once I nursed him
through this trouble, how could I or any woman in my place any
longer refuse him? So I passed him ruthlessly on to Lungern (though
my heart ached for it), and telegraphed at once to his nearest
relative, Lady Georgina, to come up and take care of him.</p>
<p>He recovered rapidly. Though sore and shaken, his worst hurts,
it turned out, were sprains; and in three or four days he was ready
to go on again. I called to see him before he left. I dreaded the
interview; for one's own heart is a hard enemy to fight so long:
but how could I let him go without one word of farewell to him?</p>
<p>'After this, Lois,' he said, taking my hand in his&mdash;and I
was weak enough, for a moment, to let it lie there&mdash;'you
<i>cannot</i> say No to me!'</p>
<p>Oh, how I longed to fling myself upon him and cry
out,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg
138]</a></span> 'No, Harold, I cannot! I love you too dearly!' But
his future and Marmaduke Ashurst's half million restrained me: for
his sake and for my own I held myself in courageously. Though,
indeed, it needed some courage and self-control. I withdrew my hand
slowly. 'Do you remember,' I said, 'you asked me that first day at
Schlangenbad'&mdash;it was an epoch to me now, that first
day&mdash;'whether I was medi&aelig;val or modern? And I answered,
"Modern, I hope." And you said, "That's well!"&mdash; You see, I
don't forget the least things you say to me. Well, because I am
modern&mdash;'my lips trembled and belied me&mdash;'I can answer
you No. I can even now refuse you. The old-fashioned girl, the
medi&aelig;val girl, would have held that because she saved your
life (if I <i>did</i> save your life, which is a matter of opinion)
she was bound to marry you. But <i>I</i> am modern, and I see
things differently. If there were reasons at Schlangenbad which
made it impracticable for me to accept you&mdash;though my heart
pleaded hard&mdash;I do not deny it&mdash;those reasons cannot have
disappeared merely because you have chosen to fall over a
precipice, and I have pulled you up again. My decision was founded,
you see, not on passing accidents of situation, but on permanent
considerations. Nothing has happened in the last three days to
affect those considerations. We are still ourselves: you, rich; I,
a penniless adventuress. I could not accept you when you asked me
at Schlangenbad. On just the same grounds, I cannot accept you now.
I do not see how the unessential fact that I made myself into a
winch to pull you up the cliff, and that I am still smarting for
it&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>He looked me all over comically. 'How severe we are!' he cried,
in a bantering tone. 'And how extremely Girtony! A System of Logic,
Ratiocinative and Inductive, by Lois Cayley! What a pity we didn't
take a professor's chair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139"

It's not yourself at all! It's an attempt to be unnaturally and
unfemininely reasonable.'</p>
<p>Logic fled. I broke down utterly. 'Harold,' I cried, rising, 'I
love you! I admit I love you! But I will never marry
you&mdash;while you have those thousands.'</p>
<p>'I haven't got them yet!'</p>
<p>'Or the chance of inheriting them.'</p>
<p>He smothered my hand with kisses&mdash;for I withdrew my face.
'If you admit you love me,' he cried, quite joyously, 'then all is
well. When once a woman admits that, the rest is but a matter of
time&mdash;and, Lois, I can wait a thousand years for you.'</p>
<p>'Not in my case,' I answered through my tears. 'Not in my case,
Harold! I am a modern woman, and what I say I mean. I will renew my
promise. If ever you are poor and friendless, come to me; I am
yours. Till then, don't harrow me by asking me the
impossible!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id=
"Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>
<p>I tore myself away. At the hall door, Lady Georgina intercepted
me. She glanced at my red eyes. 'Then you have taken him?' she
cried, seizing my hand.</p>
<p>I shook my head firmly. I could hardly speak. 'No, Lady
Georgina,' I answered, in a choking voice. 'I have refused him
again. I will not stand in his way. I will not ruin his
prospects.'</p>
<p>She drew back and let her chin drop. 'Well, of all the
hard-hearted, cruel, obdurate young women I ever saw in my born
days, if you're not the very hardest&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>I half ran from the house. I hurried home to the <i>chalet</i>.
There, I dashed into my own room, locked the door behind me, flung
myself wildly on my bed, and, burying my face in my hands, had a
good, long, hard-hearted, cruel, obdurate cry&mdash;exactly like
any other medi&aelig;val woman. It's all very well being modern;
but my experience is that, when it comes to a man one
loves&mdash;well, the Middle Ages are still horribly strong within

<p>When Elsie's holidays&mdash;I beg pardon, vacation&mdash;came to
an end, she proposed to return to her High School in London. Zeal
for the higher mathematics devoured her. But she still looked so
frail, and coughed so often&mdash;a perfect <i>Campo Santo</i> of a
cough&mdash;in spite of her summer of open-air exercise, that I
positively worried her into consulting a doctor&mdash;not one of
the Fortescue-Langley order. The report he gave was mildly
unfavourable. He spoke disrespectfully of the apex of her right
lung. It was not exactly tubercular, he remarked, but he 'feared
tuberculosis'&mdash;excuse the long words; the phrase was his, not
mine; I repeat <i>verbatim</i>. He vetoed her exposing herself to a
winter in London in her present unstable condition. Davos? Well,
no. <i>Not</i> Davos: with deliberative thumb and finger on
close-shaven chin. He judged her too delicate for such drastic
remedies. Those high mountain stations suited best the robust
invalid, who had dropped by accident into casual phthisis. For Miss
Petheridge's case&mdash;looking wise&mdash;he would not recommend
the Riviera, either: too stimulating, too exciting. What this young
lady needed most was rest: rest in some agreeable southern town,
some city of the soul&mdash;say Rome or Florence&mdash;where she
might find much to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id=
"Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> interest her, and might forget the
apex of her right lung in the new world of art that opened around
her.</p>
<p>'Very well,' I said, promptly; 'that's settled, Elsie. The apex
and you shall winter in Florence.'</p>
<p>'But, Brownie, can we afford it?'</p>
<p>'Afford it?' I echoed. 'Goodness gracious, my dear child, what a
bourgeois sentiment! Your medical attendant says to you, "Go to
Florence": and to Florence you must go; there's no getting out of
it. Why, even the swallows fly south when their medical attendant
tells them England is turning a trifle too cold for them.'</p>
<p>'But what will Miss Latimer say? She depends upon me to come
back at the beginning of term. She <i>must</i> have <i>somebody</i>
to undertake the higher mathematics.'</p>
<p>'And she will get somebody, dear,' I answered, calmly. 'Don't
trouble your sweet little head about that. An eminent statistician
has calculated that five hundred and thirty duly qualified young
women are now standing four-square in a solid phalanx in the
streets of London, all agog to teach the higher mathematics to
anyone who wants them at a moment's notice. Let Miss Latimer take
her pick of the five hundred and thirty. I'll wire to her at once:
"Elsie Petheridge unable through ill health to resume her duties.
Ordered to Florence. Resigns post. Engage substitute."
<i>That's</i> the way to do it.'</p>
<p>Elsie clasped her small white hands in the despair of the woman
who considers herself indispensable&mdash;as if we were any of us
indispensable! 'But, dearest, the girls! They'll be <i>so</i>
disappointed!'</p>
<p>'They'll get over it,' I answered, grimly. 'There are worse
disappointments in store for them in life&mdash; Which is a fine
old crusted platitude worthy of Aunt Susan. Anyhow, I've decided.
Look here, Elsie: I stand to you <i>in loco<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
parentis</i>.' I have already remarked, I think, that she was three
years my senior; but I was so pleased with this phrase that I
repeated it lovingly. 'I stand to you, dear, <i>in loco
parentis</i>. Now, I can't let you endanger your precious health by
returning to town and Miss Latimer this winter. Let us be
categorical. I go to Florence; you go with me.'</p>
<p>'What shall we live upon?' Elsie suggested, piteously.</p>
<p>'Our fellow-creatures, as usual,' I answered, with prompt
callousness. 'I object to these base utilitarian considerations
being imported into the discussion of a serious question. Florence
is the city of art; as a woman of culture, it behoves you to revel
in it. Your medical attendant sends you there; as a patient and an
invalid, you can revel with a clear conscience. Money? Well, money
is a secondary matter. All philosophies and all religions agree
that money is mere dross, filthy lucre. Rise superior to it. We
have a fair sum in hand to the credit of the firm; we can pick up
some more, I suppose, in Florence.'</p>
<p>'How?'</p>
<p>I reflected. 'Elsie,' I said, 'you are deficient in
Faith&mdash;which is one of the leading Christian graces. My
mission in life is to correct that want in your spiritual nature.
Now, observe how beautifully all these events work in together! The
winter comes, when no man can bicycle, especially in Switzerland.
Therefore, what is the use of my stopping on here after October?
Again, in pursuance of my general plan of going round the world, I
must get forward to Italy. Your medical attendant considerately
orders you at the same time to Florence. In Florence we shall still
have chances of selling Manitous, though possibly, I admit, in
diminished numbers. I confess at once that people come to
Switzerland to tour, and are therefore liable to need our machines;
while they go to Florence to look at pictures, and a bicycle
would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg
144]</a></span> doubtless prove inconvenient in the Uffizi or the
Pitti. Still, we <i>may</i> sell a few. But I descry another
opening. You write shorthand, don't you?'</p>
<p>'A little, dear; only ninety words a minute.'</p>
<p>'<i>That's</i> not business. Advertise yourself, <i>&agrave;
la</i> Cyrus Hitchcock! Say boldly, "I write shorthand." Leave the
world to ask, "How fast?" It will ask it quick enough without your
suggesting it. Well, my idea is this. Florence is a town teeming
with English tourists of the cultivated classes&mdash;men of
letters, painters, antiquaries, art-critics. I suppose even
art-critics may be classed as cultivated. Such people are sure to
need literary aid. We exist, to supply it. We will set up the
Florentine School of Stenography and Typewriting. We'll buy a
couple of typewriters.'</p>
<p>'How can we pay for them, Brownie?'</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="ILL_036" id=

height="462" alt="THERE&#39;S ENTERPRISE FOR YOU!" title="">
<span class="caption">THERE&#39;S ENTERPRISE FOR YOU!</span></div>
<p>I gazed at her in despair. 'Elsie,' I cried, clapping my hand to
my head, 'you are not practical. Did I ever suggest we should pay
for them? I said merely, buy them. Base is the slave that pays.
That's Shakespeare. And we all know Shakespeare is the mirror of
nature. Argal, it would be unnatural to pay for a typewriter. We
will hire a room in Florence (on tick, of course), and begin
operations. Clients will flock in; and we tide over the winter.
<i>There's</i> enterprise for you!' And I struck an attitude.</p>
<p>Elsie's face looked her doubts. I walked across to Mrs.
Evelegh's desk, and began writing a letter. It occurred to me that
Mr. Hitchcock, who was a man of business, might be able to help a
woman of business in this delicate matter. I put the point to him
fairly and squarely, without circumlocution; we were going to start
an English typewriting office in Florence; what was the ordinary
way for people to become possessed of a typewriting machine,
without the odious and mercenary preliminary of paying for
it?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg
145]</a></span> The answer came back with commendable
promptitude.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Miss</span>,&mdash;Your spirit of
enterprise is really remarkable! I have forwarded your letter to my
friends of the Spread Eagle Typewriting and Phonograph Company,
Limited, of New York City, informing them of your desire to open an
agency for the sale of their machines in Florence, Italy, and
giving them my estimate of your business capacities. I have advised
their London house to present you with two complimentary machines
for your own use and your partner's, and also to supply a number of
others for disposal in the city of Florence. If you would further
like to undertake an agency for the development of the trade in
salt codfish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id=
"Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> (large quantities of which are, of
course, consumed in Catholic Europe), I could put you into
communication with my respected friends, Messrs. Abel Woodward and
Co., exporters of preserved provisions, St John, Newfoundland. But,
perhaps in this suggestion I am not sufficiently
high-toned.&mdash;Respectfully, <span class="smcap">Cyrus W.
Hitchcock</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>The moment had arrived for Elsie to be firm. 'I have no
prejudice against trade, Brownie,' she observed emphatically; 'but
I do draw the line at salt fish.'</p>
<p>'So do I, dear,' I answered.</p>
<p>She sighed her relief. I really believe she half expected to
find me trotting about Florence with miscellaneous samples of
Messrs. Abel Woodward's esteemed productions protruding from my
pocket.</p>
<p>So to Florence we went. My first idea was to travel by the
Brenner route through the Tyrol; but a queer little episode which
met us at the outset on the Austrian frontier put a check to this
plan. We cycled to the border, sending our trunks on by rail. When
we went to claim them at the Austrian Custom-house, we were told
they were detained 'for political reasons.'</p>
<p>'Political reasons?' I exclaimed, nonplussed.</p>
<p>'Even so, Fr&auml;ulein. Your boxes contain revolutionary
literature.'</p>
<p>'Some mistake!' I cried, warmly. I am but a drawing-room
Socialist.</p>
<p>'Not at all; look here.' And he drew a small book out of Elsie's
portmanteau.</p>
<p>What? Elsie a conspirator? Elsie in league with Nihilists? So
mild and so meek! I could never have believed it. I took the book
in my hands and read the title, 'Revolution of the Heavenly
Bodies.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg
147]</a></span></p>
<p>'But this is astronomy,' I burst out. 'Don't you see?
Sun-and-star circling. The revolution of the planets.'</p>
<p>'It matters not, Fr&auml;ulein. Our instructions are strict. We
have orders to intercept <i>all</i> revolutionary literature
without distinction.'</p>
<p>'Come, Elsie,' I said, firmly, 'this is <i>too</i> ridiculous.
Let us give them a clear berth, these Kaiserly-Kingly blockheads!'
So we registered our luggage right back to Lucerne, and cycled over
the Gotthard.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 474px;"><a name="ILL_037" id=

"caption">PAINTING THE SIGN-BOARD.</span></div>
<p>When at last, by leisurely stages, we arrived at Florence, I
felt there was no use in doing things by halves. If you are going
to start the Florentine School of Stenography and Typewriting, you
may as well start it on a proper basis. So I took sunny rooms at a
nice hotel for myself and Elsie, and hired a ground floor in a
convenient house, close under the shadow of the great marble
Campanile. (Considerations of space compel me to curtail the usual
gush about Arnolfo and Giotto.) This was our office. When I had got
a Tuscan painter to plant our flag in the shape of a sign-board, I
sailed forth into the street and inspected it from outside with a
swelling heart. It is true, the Tuscan painter's unaccountable
predilection for the rare spellings 'Scool' without an <i>h</i> and
'Stenografy' with an <i>f</i>, somewhat damped my exuberant pride
for the moment; but I made him take the board back and correct his
Italianate English. As soon as all was fitted up with desk and
tables we reposed upon our laurels, and waited only for customers
in shoals to pour in upon us. <i>I</i> called them 'customers';
Elsie maintained that we ought rather to say 'clients.' Being by
temperament averse to sectarianism, I did not dispute the point
with her.</p>
<p>We reposed on our laurels&mdash;in vain. Neither customers nor
clients seemed in any particular hurry to disturb our
leisure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg
148]</a></span></p>
<p>I confess I took this ill. It was a rude awakening. I had begun
to regard myself as the special favourite of a fairy godmother; it
surprised me to find that any undertaking of mine did not succeed
immediately. However, reflecting that my fairy godmother's name was
really Enterprise, I recalled Mr. Cyrus W. Hitchcock's advice, and
advertised.</p>
<p>'There's one good thing about Florence, Elsie,' I said, just to
keep up her courage. 'When the customers <i>do</i> come, they'll be
interesting people, and it will be interesting work. Artistic work,
don't you know&mdash;Fra Angelico, and Della Robbia, and all that
sort of thing; or else fresh light on Dante and
Petrarch!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id=
"Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>
<p>'When they <i>do</i> come, no doubt,' Elsie answered, dubiously.
'But do you know, Brownie, it strikes me there isn't quite that
literary stir and ferment one might expect in Florence. Dante and
Petrarch appear to be dead. The distinguished authors fail to
stream in upon us as one imagined with manuscripts to copy.'</p>
<p>I affected an air of confidence&mdash;for I had sunk capital in
the concern (that's business-like&mdash;sunk capital!). 'Oh, we're
a new firm,' I assented, carelessly. 'Our enterprise is yet young.
When cultivated Florence learns we're here, cultivated Florence
will invade us in its thousands.'</p>
<p>But we sat in our office and bit our thumbs all day; the
thousands stopped at home. We had ample opportunities for making
studies of the decorative detail on the Campanile, till we knew
every square inch of it better than Mr. Ruskin. Elsie's notebook
contains, I believe, eleven hundred separate sketches of the
Campanile, from the right end, the left end, and the middle of our
window, with eight hundred and five distinct distortions of the
individual statues that adorn its niches on the side turned towards
us.</p>
<p>At last, after we had sat, and bitten our thumbs, and sketched
the Four Greater Prophets for a fortnight on end, an immense
excitement occurred. An old gentleman was distinctly seen to
approach and to look up at the sign-board which decorated our
office.</p>
<p>I instantly slipped in a sheet of foolscap, and began to
type-write with alarming speed&mdash;click, click, click; while
Elsie, rising to the occasion, set to work to transcribe imaginary
shorthand as if her life depended upon it.</p>
<p>The old gentleman, after a moment's hesitation, lifted the latch
of the door somewhat nervously. I affected to take no notice of
him, so breathless was the haste with which our immense business
connection compelled me to finger the<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> keyboard: but, looking
up at him under my eyelashes, I could just make out he was a
peculiarly bland and urbane old person, dressed with the greatest
care, and some attention to fashion. His face was smooth; it tended
towards portliness.</p>
<p>He made up his mind, and entered the office. I continued to
click till I had reached the close of a sentence&mdash;'Or to take
arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing, end them.' Then I
looked up sharply. 'Can I do anything for you?' I inquired, in the
smartest tone of business. (I observe that politeness is not
professional.)</p>

height="500" alt="THE URBANE OLD GENTLEMAN." title=""> <span class=
"caption">THE URBANE OLD GENTLEMAN.</span></div>
<p>The Urbane Old Gentleman came forward with his hat in his hand.
He looked as if he had just landed from the Eighteenth Century. His
figure was that of Mr. Edward Gibbon. 'Yes, madam,' he said, in a
markedly deferential tone, fussing about with the rim of his hat as
he spoke, and adjusting his <i>pince-nez</i>. 'I was recommended to
your&mdash;ur&mdash;your establishment for shorthand and
typewriting. I have some work which I wish done, if it falls within
your province. But I am <i>rather</i> particular. I require a quick
worker. Excuse my asking it, but how many words can you do a
minute?'</p>
<p>'Shorthand?' I asked, sharply, for I wished to imitate official
habits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg
151]</a></span></p>
<p>The Urbane Old Gentleman bowed. 'Yes, shorthand. Certainly.'</p>
<p>I waved my hand with careless grace towards Elsie&mdash;as if
these things happened to us daily. 'Miss Petheridge undertakes the
shorthand department,' I said, with decision. 'I am the typewriting
from dictation. Miss Petheridge, forward!'</p>
<p>Elsie rose to it like an angel. 'A hundred,' she answered,
confronting him.</p>
<p>The old gentleman bowed again. 'And your terms?' he inquired, in
a honey-tongued voice. 'If I may venture to ask them.'</p>
<p>We handed him our printed tariff. He seemed satisfied.</p>
<p>'Could you spare me an hour this morning?' he asked, still
fingering his hat nervously with his puffy hand. 'But perhaps you
are engaged. I fear I intrude upon you.'</p>
<p>'Not at all,' I answered, consulting an imaginary engagement
list. 'This work can wait. Let me see: 11.30. Elsie, I think you
have nothing to do before one, that cannot be put off? Quite
so!&mdash;very well, then; yes, we are both at your service.'</p>
<p>The Urbane Old Gentleman looked about him for a seat. I pushed
him our one easy chair. He withdrew his gloves with great
deliberation, and sat down in it with an apologetic glance. I could
gather from his dress and his diamond pin that he was wealthy.
Indeed, I half guessed who he was already. There was a fussiness
about his manner which seemed strangely familiar to me.</p>
<p>He sat down by slow degrees, edging himself about till he was
thoroughly comfortable. I could see he was of the kind that will
have comfort. He took out his notes and a packet of letters, which
he sorted slowly. Then he looked hard at me and at Elsie. He seemed
to be making his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id=
"Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> choice between us. After a time he
spoke. 'I <i>think</i>,' he said, in a most leisurely voice, 'I
will not trouble your friend to write shorthand for me, after all.
Or should I say your assistant? Excuse my change of plan. I will
content myself with dictation. You can follow on the machine?'</p>
<p>'As fast as you choose to dictate to me.'</p>
<p>He glanced at his notes and began a letter. It was a curious
communication. It seemed to be all about buying Bertha and selling
Clara&mdash;a cold-blooded proceeding which almost suggested
slave-dealing. I gathered he was giving instructions to his agent:
could he have business relations with Cuba, I wondered. But there
were also hints of mysterious middies&mdash;brave British tars to
the rescue, possibly! Perhaps my bewilderment showed itself upon my
face, for at last he looked queerly at me. 'You don't quite like
this, I'm afraid,' he said, breaking off short.</p>
<p>I was the soul of business. 'Not at all,' I answered. 'I am an
automaton&mdash;nothing more. It is a typewriter's function to
transcribe the words a client dictates as if they were absolutely
meaningless to her.'</p>
<p>'Quite right,' he answered, approvingly. 'Quite right. I see you
understand. A very proper spirit!'</p>
<p>Then the Woman within me got the better of the Typewriter.
'Though I confess,' I continued, 'I <i>do</i> feel it is a little
unkind to sell Clara at once for whatever she will fetch. It seems
to me&mdash;well&mdash;unchivalrous.'</p>
<p>He smiled, but held his peace.</p>
<p>'Still&mdash;the middies,' I went on: 'they will perhaps take
care that these poor girls are not ill-treated.'</p>
<p>He leaned back, clasped his hands, and regarded me fixedly.
'Bertha,' he said, after a pause, 'is Brighton A's&mdash;to be
strictly correct, London, Brighton, and South Coast First
Preference Debentures. Clara is Glasgow and
South-Western<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id=
"Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> Deferred Stock. Middies are Midland
Ordinary. But I respect your feeling. You are a young lady of
principle.' And he fidgeted more than ever.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"><a name="ILL_039" id=

height="438" alt="HE WENT ON DICTATING FOR JUST AN HOUR." title="">
<span class="caption">HE WENT ON DICTATING FOR JUST AN
HOUR.</span></div>
<p>He went on dictating for just an hour. His subject-matter
bewildered me. It was all about India Bills, and telegraphic
transfers, and selling cotton short, and holding tight to Egyptian
Unified. Markets, it seemed, were glutted. Hungarians were only to
be dealt in if they hardened&mdash;hardened sinners I know, but
what are hardened Hungarians? And fears were not unnaturally
expressed that Turks might be 'irregular,' Consols, it appeared,
were certain to give way for political reasons; but the downward
tendency of Australians, I was relieved to learn, for the honour of
so great a group of colonies, could only be temporary. Greeks were
growing decidedly worse, though I had always understood<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Greeks were bad enough already; and Argentine Central were likely
to be weak; but Provincials must soon become commendably firm, and
if Uruguays went flat, something good ought to be made out of them.
Scotch rails might shortly be quiet&mdash; I always understood they
were based upon sleepers; but if South-Eastern stiffened, advantage
should certainly be taken of their stiffening. He would telegraph
particulars on Monday morning. And so on till my brain reeled. Oh,
artistic Florence! was <i>this</i> the Filippo Lippi, the Michael
Angelo I dreamed of?</p>
<p>At the end of the hour, the Urbane Old Gentleman rose urbanely.
He drew on his gloves again with the greatest deliberation, and
hunted for his stick as if his life depended upon it. 'Let me see;
I had a pencil; oh, thanks; yes, that is it. This cover protects
the point. My hat? Ah, certainly. And my notes; much obliged; notes
<i>always</i> get mislaid. People are so careless. Then I will come
again to-morrow; the same hour, if you will kindly keep yourself
disengaged. Though, excuse me, you had better make an entry of it
at once upon your agenda.'</p>
<p>'I shall remember it,' I answered, smiling.</p>
<p>'No; will you? But you haven't my name.'</p>
<p>'I know it,' I answered. 'At least, I think so. You are Mr.
Marmaduke Ashurst. Lady Georgina Fawley sent you here.'</p>
<p>He laid down his hat and gloves again, so as to regard me more
undistracted. 'You are a most remarkable young lady,' he said, in a
very slow voice. 'I impressed upon Georgina that she must not
mention to you that I was coming. How on earth did you recognise
me?'</p>
<p>'Intuition, most likely.'</p>
<p>He stared at me with a sort of suspicion. '<i>Please</i> don't
tell me you think me like my sister,' he went on. 'For<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
though, of course, every right-minded man feels&mdash;ur&mdash;a
natural respect and affection for the members his
family&mdash;bows, if I may so say, to the inscrutable decrees of
Providence&mdash;which has mysteriously burdened him with
them&mdash;still, there <i>are</i> points about Lady Georgina which
I cannot conscientiously assert I approve of.'</p>
<p>I remembered 'Marmy's a fool,' and held my tongue
judiciously.</p>
<p>'I do not resemble her, I hope,' he persisted, with a look which
I could almost describe as wistful.</p>
<p>'A family likeness, perhaps,' I put in. 'Family likenesses
exist, you know&mdash;often with complete divergence of tastes and
character.'</p>
<p>He looked relieved. 'That is true. Oh, how true! But the
likeness in my case, I must admit, escapes me.'</p>
<p>I temporised. 'Strangers see these things most,' I said, airing
the stock platitudes. 'It may be superficial. And, of course, one
knows that profound differences of intellect and moral feeling
often occur within the limits of a single family.'</p>
<p>'You are quite right,' he said, with decision. 'Georgina's
principles are not mine. Excuse my remarking it, but you seem to be
a young lady of unusual penetration.'</p>
<p>I saw he took my remark as a compliment. What I really meant to
say was that a commonplace man might easily be brother to so clever
a woman as Lady Georgina.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 493px;"><a name="ILL_040" id=

height="500" alt="HE BOWED TO US EACH SEPARATELY." title="">
<span class="caption">HE BOWED TO US EACH SEPARATELY.</span></div>
<p>He gathered up his hat, his stick, his gloves, his notes, and
his typewritten letters, one by one, and backed out politely. He
was a punctilious millionaire. He had risen by urbanity to his
brother directors, like a model guinea-pig. He bowed to us each
separately as if we had been duchesses.</p>
<p>As soon as he was gone, Elsie turned to me.
'Brownie,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg
156]</a></span> how on earth did you guess it? They're so awfully
different!'</p>
<p>'Not at all,' I answered. 'A few surface unlikenesses only just
mask an underlying identity. Their features are the same; but his
are plump; hers, shrunken. Lady Georgina's expression is sharp and
worldly; Mr. Ashurst's is smooth, and bland, and financial. And
then their manner! Both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id=
"Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> are fussy; but Lady Georgina's is
honest, open, ill-tempered fussiness; Mr. Ashurst's is concealed
under an artificial mask of obsequious politeness. One's
cantankerous; the other's only pernicketty. It's one tune, after
all, in two different keys.'</p>
<p>From that day forth, the Urbane Old Gentleman was a daily
visitor. He took an hour at a time at first; but after a few days,
the hour lengthened out (apologetically) to an entire morning. He
'presumed to ask' my Christian name the second day, and remembered
my father&mdash;'a man of excellent principles.' But he didn't care
for Elsie to work for him. Fortunately for her, other work dropped
in, once we had found a client, or else, poor girl, she would have
felt sadly slighted. I was glad she had something to do; the sense
of dependence weighed heavily upon her.</p>
<p>The Urbane Old Gentleman did not confine himself entirely, after
the first few days, to Stock Exchange literature. He was engaged on
a Work&mdash;he spoke of it always with bated breath, and a capital
letter was implied in his intonation; the Work was one on the
Interpretation of Prophecy. Unlike Lady Georgina, who was tart and
crisp, Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst was devout and decorous; where she
said 'pack of fools,' he talked with unction of 'the mental
deficiencies of our poorer brethren.' But his religious opinions
and his stockbroking had got strangely mixed up at the wash
somehow. He was convinced that the British nation represented the
Lost Ten Tribes of Israel&mdash;and in particular Ephraim&mdash;a
matter on which, as a mere lay-woman, I would not presume either to
agree with him or to differ from him. 'That being so, Miss Cayley,
we can easily understand that the existing commercial prosperity of
England depends upon the promises made to Abraham.'<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>
<p>I assented, without committing myself. 'It would seem to
follow.'</p>
<p>Mr. Ashurst, encouraged by so much assent, went on to unfold his
System of Interpretation, which was of a strictly commercial or
company-promoting character. It ran like a prospectus. 'We have
inherited the gold of Australia and the diamonds of the Cape,' he
said, growing didactic, and lifting one fat forefinger; 'we are now
inheriting Klondike and the Rand, for it is morally certain that we
shall annex the Transvaal. Again, "the chief things of the ancient
mountains, and the precious things of the everlasting hills." What
does that mean? The ancient mountains are clearly the Rockies; can
the everlasting hills be anything but the Himalayas? "For they
shall suck of the abundance of the seas"&mdash;that refers, of
course, to our world-wide commerce, due mainly to
imports&mdash;"and of the treasures hid in the sand." Which sand?
Undoubtedly, I say, the desert of Mount Sinai. What then is our
obvious destiny? A lady of your intelligence must gather at once
that it is&mdash;&mdash;?' He paused and gazed at me.</p>
<p>'To drive the Sultan out of Syria,' I suggested tentatively,
'and to annex Palestine to our practical province of Egypt?'</p>
<p>He leaned back in his chair and folded his fat hands in
undisguised satisfaction. 'Now, you are a thinker of exceptional
penetration,' he broke out. 'Do you know, Miss Cayley, I have tried
to make that point clear to the War Office, and the Prime Minister,
and many leading financiers in the City of London, and I
<i>can't</i> get them to see it. They have no heads, those people.
But <i>you</i> catch at it at a glance. Why, I endeavoured to
interest Rothschild and induce him to join me in my Palestine
Development Syndicate, and, will you believe it, the man
refused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg
159]</a></span> point blank. Though if he had only looked at Nahum
iii. 17&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Mere financiers,' I said, smiling, 'will not consider these
questions from a historical and prophetic point of view. They see
nothing above percentages.'</p>
<p>'That's it,' he replied, lighting up. 'They have no higher
feelings. Though, mind you, there will be dividends too; mark my
words, there will be dividends. This syndicate, besides fulfilling
the prophecies, will pay forty per cent on every penny embarked in
it.'</p>
<p>'Only forty per cent for Ephraim!' I murmured, half below my
breath. 'Why, Judah is said to batten upon sixty.'</p>
<p>He caught at it eagerly, without perceiving my gentle
sarcasm.</p>
<p>'In that case, we might even expect seventy,' he put in with a
gasp of anticipation. 'Though I approached Rothschild first with my
scheme on purpose, so that Israel and Judah might once more unite
in sharing the promises.'</p>
<p>'Your combined generosity and commercial instinct does you
credit,' I answered. 'It is rare to find so much love for an
abstract study side by side with such conspicuous financial
ability.'</p>
<p>His guilelessness was beyond words. He swallowed it like an
infant. 'So I think,' he answered. 'I am glad to observe that you
understand my character. Mere City men don't. They have no soul
above shekels. Though, as I show them, there are shekels in it,
too. Dividends, dividends, di-vidends. But <i>you</i> are a lady of
understanding and comprehension. You have been to Girton, haven't
you? Perhaps you read Greek, then?'</p>
<p>'Enough to get on with.'</p>
<p>'Could you look things up in Herodotus?'<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>
<p>'Certainly?'</p>
<p>'In the original?'</p>
<p>'Oh, dear, yes.'</p>
<p>He regarded me once more with the same astonished glance. His
own classics, I soon learnt, were limited to the amount which a
public school succeeds in dinning, during the intervals of cricket
and football into an English gentleman. Then he informed me that he
wished me to hunt up certain facts in Herodotus "and elsewhere"
confirmatory of his view that the English were the descendants of
the Ten Tribes. I promised to do so, swallowing even that
comprehensive "elsewhere." It was none of my business to believe or
disbelieve: I was paid to get up a case, and I got one up to the
best of my ability. I imagine it was at least as good as most other
cases in similar matters: at any rate, it pleased the old gentleman
vastly.</p>
<p>By dint of listening, I began to like him. But Elsie couldn't
bear him. She hated the fat crease at the back of his neck, she
told me.</p>
<p>After a week or two devoted to the Interpretation of Prophecy on
a strictly commercial basis of Founders' Shares, with interludes of
mining engineers' reports upon the rubies of Mount Sinai and the
supposed auriferous quartzites of Palestine, the Urbane Old
Gentleman trotted down to the office one day, carrying a packet of
notes of most voluminous magnitude. "Can we work in a room alone
this morning, Miss Cayley?" he asked, with mystery in his voice: he
was always mysterious. "I want to intrust you with a piece of work
of an exceptionally private and confidential character. It concerns
Property. In point of fact," he dropped his voice to a whisper. "I
want you to draw up my will for me."</p>
<p>"Certainly," I said, opening the door into the back office. But
I trembled in my shoes. Could this mean<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> that
he was going to draw up a will, disinheriting Harold
Tillington?</p>
<p>And, suppose he did, what then? My heart was in a tumult. If
Harold were rich&mdash;well and good, I could never marry him. But,
if Harold were poor&mdash; I must keep my promise. Could I wish him
to be rich? Could I wish him to be poor? My heart stood divided two
ways within me.</p>
<p>The Urbane Old Gentleman began with immense deliberation, as
befits a man of principle when Property is at stake. 'You will
kindly take down notes from my dictation,' he said, fussing with
his papers; 'and afterwards, I will ask you to be so good as to
copy it all out fair on your typewriter for signature.'</p>
<p>'Is a typewritten form legal?' I ventured to inquire.</p>
<p>'A most perspicacious young lady!' he interjected, well pleased.
'I have investigated that point, and find it perfectly regular.
Only, if I may venture to say so, there should be no erasures.'</p>
<p>'There shall be none,' I answered.</p>
<p>The Urbane Old Gentleman leant back in his easy chair, and began
dictating from his notes with tantalising deliberateness. This was
the last will and testament of him, Marmaduke Courtney Ashurst. Its
verbiage wearied me. I was eager for him to come to the point about
Harold. Instead of that, he did what it seems is usual in such
cases&mdash;set out with a number of unimportant legacies to old
family servants and other hangers-on among 'our poorer brethren.' I
fumed and fretted inwardly. Next came a series of quaint bequests
of a quite novel character. 'I give and bequeath to James Walsh and
Sons, of 720 High Holborn, London, the sum of Five Hundred Pounds,
in consideration of the benefit they have conferred upon humanity
by the invention of a sugar-spoon or silver sugar-sifter, by
means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg
162]</a></span> of which it is possible to dust sugar upon a tart
or pudding without letting the whole or the greater part of the
material run through the apertures uselessly in transit. You must
have observed, Miss Cayley&mdash;with your usual
perspicacity&mdash;that most sugar-sifters allow the sugar to fall
through them on to the table prematurely.'</p>
<p>'I have noticed it,' I answered, trembling with anxiety.</p>
<p>'James Walsh and Sons, acting on a hint from me, have succeeded
in inventing a form of spoon which does not possess that
regrettable drawback. "Run through the apertures uselessly in
transit," I think I said last. Yes, thank you. Very good. We will
now continue. And I give and bequeath the like sum of Five Hundred
Pounds&mdash;did I say, free of legacy duty? No? Then please add it
to James Walsh's clause. Five Hundred Pounds, free of legacy duty,
to Thomas Webster Jones, of Wheeler Street, Soho, for his admirable
invention of a pair of braces which will not slip down on the
wearer's shoulders after half an hour's use. Most braces, you must
have observed, Miss Cayley&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'My acquaintance with braces is limited, not to say abstract,' I
interposed, smiling.</p>
<p>He gazed at me, and twirled his fat thumbs.</p>
<p>'<i>Of</i> course,' he murmured. '<i>Of</i> course. But most
braces, you may not be aware, slip down unpleasantly on the
shoulder-blade, and so lead to an awkward habit of hitching them up
by the sleeve-hole of the waistcoat at frequent intervals. Such a
habit must be felt to be ungraceful. Thomas Webster Jones, to whom
I pointed out this error of manufacture, has invented a brace the
two halves of which diverge at a higher angle than usual, and
fasten further towards the centre of the body in front&mdash;pardon
these details&mdash;so as to obviate that difficulty. He has given
me satisfaction, and he deserves to be rewarded.'<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>
<p>I heard through it all the voice of Lady Georgina observing,
tartly, 'Why the idiots can't make braces to fit one at first
passes <i>my</i> comprehension. But, there, my dear; the people who
manufacture them are a set of born fools, and what can you expect
from an imbecile?' Mr. Ashurst was Lady Georgina, veneered with a
thin layer of ingratiating urbanity. Lady Georgina was clever, and
therefore acrimonious. Mr. Ashurst was astute, and therefore
obsequious.</p>
<p>He went on with legacies to the inventor of a sauce-bottle which
did not let the last drop dribble down so as to spot the
table-cloth; of a shoe-horn the handle of which did not come
undone; and of a pair of sleeve-links which you could put off and
on without injury to the temper. 'A real benefactor, Miss Cayley; a
real benefactor to the link-wearing classes; for he has sensibly
diminished the average annual output of profane swearing.'</p>
<p>When he left Five Hundred Pounds to his faithful servant
Frederic Higginson, courier, I was tempted to interpose; but I
refrained in time, and I was glad of it afterwards.</p>
<p>At last, after many divagations, my Urbane Old Gentleman arrived
at the central point&mdash;'and I give and bequeath to my nephew,
Harold Ashurst Tillington, Younger of Gledcliffe, Dumfriesshire,
attach&eacute; to Her Majesty's Embassy at Rome&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="ILL_041" id=

height="397" alt="I WAITED BREATHLESS." title=""> <span class=
"caption">I WAITED BREATHLESS.</span></div>
<p>I waited, breathless.</p>
<p>He was annoyingly dilatory. 'My house and estate of Ashurst
Court, in the County of Gloucester, and my town house at 24 Park
Lane North, in London, together with the residue of all my estate,
real or personal&mdash;&mdash;' and so forth.</p>
<p>I breathed again. At least, I had not been called upon to
disinherit Harold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id=
"Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>
<p>'Provided always&mdash;&mdash;' he went on, in the same
voice.</p>
<p>I wondered what was coming.</p>
<p>'Provided always that the said Harold Ashurst Tillington does
not marry&mdash;&mdash;leave a blank there, Miss Cayley. I will
find out the name of the young person I desire to exclude, and fill
it in afterward. I don't recollect it at this moment, but
Higginson, no doubt, will be able to supply the deficiency. In
fact, I don't think I ever heard it; though Higginson has told me
all about the woman.'</p>
<p>'Higginson?' I inquired. 'Is he here?'</p>
<p>'Oh, dear, yes. You heard of him, I suppose, from Georgina.
Georgina is prejudiced. He has come back to me, I am glad to say.
An excellent servant, Higginson, though a trifle too omniscient.
All men are equal in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165"
id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> eyes of their Maker, of course;
but we must have due subordination. A courier ought not to be
better informed than his master&mdash;or ought at least to conceal
the fact dexterously. Well, Higginson knows this young person's
name; my sister wrote to me about her disgraceful conduct when she
first went to Schlangenbad. An adventuress, it seems; an
adventuress; quite a shocking creature. Foisted herself upon Lady
Georgina in Kensington Gardens&mdash;unintroduced, if you can
believe such a thing&mdash;with the most astonishing effrontery;
and Georgina, who will forgive anything on earth, for the sake of
what she calls originality&mdash;another name for impudence, as I
am sure you must know&mdash;took the young woman with her as her
maid to Germany. There, this minx tried to set her cap at my nephew
Harold, who can be caught at once by a pretty face; and Harold was
bowled over&mdash;almost got engaged to her. Georgina took a fancy
to the girl later, having a taste for dubious people (I cannot say
I approve of Georgina's friends), and wrote again to say her first
suspicions were unfounded: the young woman was in reality a paragon
of virtue. But <i>I</i> know better than that. Georgina has no
judgment. I regret to be obliged to confess it, but cleverness, I
fear, is the only thing in the world my excellent sister cares for.
The hussy, it seems, was certainly clever. Higginson has told me
about her. He says her bare appearance would suffice to condemn
her&mdash;a bold, fast, shameless, brazen-faced creature. But you
will forgive me, I am sure, my dear young lady: I ought not to
discuss such painted Jezebels before you. We will leave this
person's name blank. I will not sully your pen&mdash;I mean, your
typewriter&mdash;by asking you to transcribe it.'</p>
<p>I made up my mind at once. 'Mr. Ashurst,' I said, looking up
from my keyboard, '<i>I</i> can give you this girl's name; and then
you can insert the proviso immediately.'<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>
<p>'<i>You</i> can? My dear young lady, what a wonderful person you
are! You seem to know everybody, and everything. But perhaps she
was at Schlangenbad with Lady Georgina, and you were there
also?'</p>
<p>'She was,' I answered, deliberately. 'The name you want
is&mdash;Lois Cayley!'</p>
<p>He let his notes drop in his astonishment.</p>
<p>I went on with my typewriting, unmoved. 'Provided always that
the said Harold Ashurst Tillington does not marry Lois Cayley; in
which case I will and desire that the said estate shall pass
to&mdash;&mdash;whom shall I put in, Mr. Ashurst?'</p>
<p>He leant forward with his fat hands on his ample knees. 'It was
really <i>you</i>?' he inquired, open-mouthed.</p>
<p>I nodded. 'There is no use in denying the truth. Mr. Tillington
did ask me to be his wife, and I refused him.'</p>
<p>'But, my dear Miss Cayley&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'The difference in station?' I said; 'the difference, still
greater, in this world's goods? Yes, I know. I admit all that. So I
declined his offer. I did not wish to ruin his prospects.'</p>
<p>The Urbane Old Gentleman eyed me with a sudden tenderness in his
glance. 'Young men are lucky,' he said, slowly, after a short
pause; '&mdash;and&mdash; Higginson is an idiot. I say it
deliberately&mdash;an idiot! How could one dream of trusting the
judgment of a flunkey about a lady? My dear, excuse the familiarity
from one who may consider himself in a certain sense a contingent
uncle&mdash;suppose we amend the last clause by the omission of the
word <i>not</i>. It strikes me as superfluous. "Provided always the
said Harold Ashurst Tillington consents to marry"&mdash; I think
that sounds better!'</p>
<p>He looked at me with such fatherly regard that it pricked my
heart ever to have poked fun at his Interpretation<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> of
Prophecy on Stock Exchange principles. I think I flushed crimson.
'No, no,' I answered, firmly. 'That will not do either, please.
That's worse than the other way. You must not put it, Mr. Ashurst.
I could not consent to be willed away to anybody.'</p>
<p>He leant forward, with real earnestness. 'My dear,' he said,
'that's not the point. Pardon my reminding you that you are here in
your capacity as my amanuensis. I am drawing up my will, and if you
will allow me to say so, I cannot admit that anyone has a claim to
influence me in the disposition of my Property.'</p>
<p>'<i>Please!</i>' I cried, pleadingly.</p>
<p>He looked at me and paused. 'Well,' he went on at last, after a
long interval; 'since <i>you</i> insist upon it, I will leave the
bequest to stand without condition.'</p>
<p>'Thank you,' I murmured, bending low over my machine.'</p>
<p>'If I did as I like, though,' he went on, 'I should say, Unless
he marries Miss Lois Cayley (who is a deal too good for him) the
estate shall revert to Kynaston's eldest son, a confounded jackass.
I do not usually indulge in intemperate language; but I desire to
assure you, with the utmost calmness, that Kynaston's eldest son,
Lord Southminster, is a con-founded jackass.'</p>
<p>I rose and took his hand in my own spontaneously. 'Mr. Ashurst,'
I said, 'you may interpret prophecy as long as ever you like, but
you are a dear kind old gentleman. I am truly grateful to you for
your good opinion.</p>

<p>'And you will marry Harold?'</p>
<p>'Never,' I answered; 'while he is rich. I have said as much to
him.'</p>
<p>'That's hard,' he went on, slowly. 'For ... I should like to be
your uncle.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id=
"Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>
<p>I trembled all over. Elsie saved the situation by bursting in
abruptly.</p>
<p>I will only add that when Mr. Ashurst left, I copied the will
out neatly, without erasures. The rough original I threw (somewhat
carelessly) into the waste-paper basket.</p>
<p>That afternoon, somebody called to fetch the fair
copy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg
169]</a></span> for Mr. Ashurst. I went out into the front office
to see him. To my surprise, it was Higginson&mdash;in his guise as
courier.</p>
<p>He was as astonished as myself. 'What, <i>you</i> here!' he
cried. 'You dog me!'</p>
<p>'I was thinking the same thing of you, M. le Comte,' I answered,
curtsying.</p>
<p>He made no attempt at an excuse. 'Well, I have been sent for the
will,' he broke out, curtly.</p>
<p>'And you were sent for the jewel-case,' I retorted. 'No, no, Dr.
Fortescue-Langley; <i>I</i> am in charge of the will, and I will
take it myself to Mr. Ashurst.'</p>
<p>'I will be even with you yet,' he snapped out. 'I have gone back
to my old trade, and am trying to lead an honest life; but
<i>you</i> won't let me.'</p>
<p>'On the contrary,' I answered, smiling a polite smile. 'I
rejoice to hear it. If you say nothing more against me to your
employer, I will not disclose to him what I know about you. But if
you slander me, I will. So now we understand one another.'</p>
<p>And I kept the will till I could give it myself into Mr
Ashurst's own hands in his rooms that evening.<span class=

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>
<h3>THE ADVENTURE OF THE UNOBTRUSIVE OASIS</h3>
<p>I will not attempt to describe to you the minor episodes of our
next twelve months&mdash;the manuscripts we type-wrote and the
Manitous we sold. 'Tis one of my aims in a world so rich in bores
to avoid being tedious. I will merely say, therefore, that we spent
the greater part of the year in Florence, where we were building up
a connection, but rode back for the summer months to Switzerland,
as being a livelier place for the trade in bicycles. The net result
was not only that we covered our expenses, but that, as chancellor
of the exchequer, I found myself with a surplus in hand at the end
of the season.</p>
<p>When we returned to Florence for the winter, however, I confess
I began to chafe. 'This is slow work, Elsie!' I said. 'I started
out to go round the world; it has taken me eighteen months to
travel no further than Italy! At this rate, I shall reach New York
a gray-haired old lady, in a nice lace cap, and totter back into
London a venerable crone on the verge of ninety.'</p>
<p>However, those invaluable doctors came to my rescue
unexpectedly. I do love doctors; they are always sending you off at
a moment's notice to delightful places you never dreamt of. Elsie
was better, but still far from strong. I<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> took
it upon me to consult our medical attendant; and his verdict was
decisive. He did just what a doctor ought to do. 'She is getting on
very well in Florence,' he said; 'but if you want to restore her
health completely, I should advise you to take her for a winter to
Egypt. After six months of the dry, warm desert air, I don't doubt
she might return to her work in London.'</p>
<p>That last point I used as a lever with Elsie. She positively
revels in teaching mathematics. At first, to be sure, she objected
that we had only just money enough to pay our way to Cairo, and
that when we got there we might starve&mdash;her favourite
programme. I have not this extraordinary taste for starving;
<i>my</i> idea is, to go where you like, and find something decent
to eat when you get there. However, to humour her, I began to cast
about me for a source of income. There is no absolute harm in
seeing your way clear before you for a twelvemonth, though of
course it deprives you of the plot-interest of poverty.</p>
<p>'Elsie,' I said, in my best didactic style&mdash;I excel in
didactics&mdash;'you do not learn from the lessons that life sets
before you. Look at the stage, for example; the stage is
universally acknowledged at the present day to be a great teacher
of morals. Does not Irving say so?&mdash;and he ought to know.
There is that splendid model for imitation, for instance, the Clown
in the pantomime. How does Clown regulate his life? Does he take
heed for the morrow? Not a bit of it! "I wish I had a goose," he
says, at some critical juncture; and just as he says
it&mdash;pat&mdash;a super strolls upon the stage with a property
goose on a wooden tray; and Clown cries, "Oh, look here, Joey;
<i>here's</i> a goose!" and proceeds to appropriate it. Then he
puts his fingers in his mouth and observes, "I wish I had a few
apples to make the sauce with"; and as the words escape
him&mdash;pat again&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172"
id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> small boy with a very squeaky
voice runs on, carrying a basket of apples. Clown trips him up, and
bolts with the basket. <i>There's</i> a model for imitation! The
stage sets these great moral lessons before you regularly every
Christmas; yet you fail to profit by them. Govern your life on the
principles exemplified by Clown; expect to find that whatever you
want will turn up with punctuality and dispatch at the proper
moment. Be adventurous and you will be happy. Take that as a new
maxim to put in your copy-book!'</p>
<p>'I wish I could think so, dear,' Elsie answered. 'But your
confidence staggers me.'</p>
<p>That evening at our <i>table-d'h&ocirc;te</i>, however, it was
amply justified. A smooth-faced young man of ample girth and most
prosperous exterior happened to sit next us. He had his wife with
him, so I judged it safe to launch on conversation. We soon found
out he was the millionaire editor-proprietor of a great London
daily, with many more strings to his journalistic bow; his honoured
name was Elworthy. I mentioned casually that we thought of going
for the winter to Egypt. He pricked his ears up. But at the time he
said nothing. After dinner, we adjourned to the cosy <i>salon</i>.
I talked to him and his wife; and somehow, that evening, the devil
entered into me. I am subject to devils. I hasten to add, they are
mild ones. I had one of my reckless moods just then, however, and I
reeled off rattling stories of our various adventures. Mr. Elworthy
believed in youth and audacity; I could see I interested him. The
more he was amused, the more reckless I became. 'That's bright,' he
said at last, when I told him the tale of our amateur exploits in
the sale of Manitous. 'That would make a good article!'</p>
<p>'Yes,' I answered, with bravado, determined to
strike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg
173]</a></span> while the iron was hot. 'What the <i>Daily
Telephone</i> lacks is just one enlivening touch of feminine
brightness.'</p>
<p>He smiled. 'What is your forte?' he inquired.</p>
<p>'My forte,' I answered, 'is&mdash;to go where I choose, and
write what I like about it.'</p>
<p>He smiled again. 'And a very good new departure in journalism,
too! A roving commission! Have you ever tried your hand at
writing?'</p>
<p>Had I ever tried! It was the ambition of my life to see myself
in print; though, hitherto, it had been ineffectual. 'I have
written a few sketches,' I answered, with becoming modesty. As a
matter of fact, our office bulged with my unpublished
manuscripts.</p>
<p>'Could you let me see them?' he asked.</p>
<p>I assented, with inner joy, but outer reluctance. 'If you wish
it,' I murmured; 'but&mdash;you must be <i>very</i> lenient!'</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;"><a name="ILL_043" id=

title=""> <span class="caption">HE READ THEM, CRUEL MAN, BEFORE MY
VERY EYES.</span></div>
<p>Though I had not told Elsie, the truth of the matter was, I had
just then conceived an idea for a novel&mdash;my <i>magnum
opus</i>&mdash;the setting of which compelled Egyptian local
colour; and I was therefore dying to get to Egypt, if chance so
willed it. I submitted a few of my picked manuscripts accordingly
to Mr. Elworthy, in fear and trembling. He read them, cruel man,
before my very eyes; I sat and waited, twiddling my thumbs, demure
but apprehensive.</p>
<p>When he had finished, he laid them down.</p>
<p>'Racy!' he said. 'Racy! You're quite right, Miss Cayley. That's
just what we want on the <i>Daily Telephone</i>. I should like to
print these three,' selecting them out, 'at our usual rate of pay
per thousand.'</p>
<p>'You are very kind.' But the room reeled with me.</p>
<p>'Not at all. I am a man of business. And these are good copy.
Now, about this Egypt. I will put the matter<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> in
the shape of a business proposition. Will you undertake, if I pay
your passage, and your friend's, with all travelling expenses, to
let me have three descriptive articles a week, on Cairo, the Nile,
Syria, and India, running to about two thousand words apiece, at
three guineas a thousand?'</p>
<p>My breath came and went. It was positive opulence. The super
with the goose couldn't approach it for patness. My editor had
brought me the apple sauce as well, without even giving me the
trouble of cooking it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id=
"Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>
<p>The very next day everything was arranged. Elsie tried to
protest, on the foolish ground that she had no money: but the
faculty had ordered the apex of her right lung to go to Egypt, and
I couldn't let her fly in the face of the faculty. We secured our
berths in a P. and O. steamer from Brindisi; and within a week we
were tossing upon the bosom of the blue Mediterranean.</p>
<p>People who haven't crossed the blue Mediterranean cherish an
absurd idea that it is always calm and warm and sunny. I am sorry
to take away any sea's character; but I speak of it as I find it
(to borrow a phrase from my old gyp at Girton); and I am bound to
admit that the Mediterranean did not treat me as a lady expects to
be treated. It behaved disgracefully. People may rhapsodize as long
as they choose about a life on the ocean wave; for my own part, I
wouldn't give a pin for sea-sickness. We glided down the Adriatic
from Brindisi to Corfu with a reckless profusion of lateral motion
which suggested the idea that the ship must have been drinking.</p>
<p>I tried to rouse Elsie when we came abreast of the Ionian
Islands, and to remind her that 'Here was the home of Nausicaa in
the Odyssey.' Elsie failed to respond; she was otherwise occupied.
At last, I succumbed and gave it up. I remember nothing further
till a day and a half later, when we got under lee of Crete, and
the ship showed a tendency to resume the perpendicular. Then I
began once more to take a languid interest in the dinner
question.</p>
<p>I may add parenthetically that the Mediterranean is a mere bit
of a sea, when you look at it on the map&mdash;a pocket sea, to be
regarded with mingled contempt and affection; but you learn to
respect it when you find that it takes four clear days and nights
of abject misery merely to run across its eastern basin from
Brindisi to Alexandria. I respected<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> the Mediterranean
immensely while we lay off the Peloponnesus in the trough of the
waves with a north wind blowing; I only began to temper my respect
with a distant liking when we passed under the welcome shelter of
Crete on a calm, star-lit evening.</p>
<p>It was deadly cold. We had not counted upon such weather in the
sunny south. I recollected now that the Greeks were wont to
represent Boreas as a chilly deity, and spoke of the Thracian
breeze with the same deferentially deprecating adjectives which we
ourselves apply to the east wind of our fatherland; but that apt
classical memory somehow failed to console or warm me. A
good-natured male passenger, however, volunteered to ask us, 'Will
I get ye a rug, ladies?' The form of his courteous question
suggested the probability of his Irish origin.</p>
<p>'You are very kind,' I answered. 'If you don't want it for
yourself, I'm sure my friend would be glad to have the use of
it.'</p>
<p>'Is it meself? Sure I've got me big ulsther, and I'm as warrum
as a toast in it. But ye're not provided for this weather. Ye've
thrusted too much to those rascals the po-uts. 'Where breaks the
blue Sicilian say,' the rogues write. <i>I'd</i> like to set them
down in it, wid a nor'-easter blowing!'</p>
<p>He fetched up his rug. It was ample and soft, a smooth brown
camel-hair. He wrapped us both up in it. We sat late on deck that
night, as warm as a toast ourselves, thanks to our genial
Irishman.</p>

""> <span class="caption">&#39;TIS DOCTOR MACLOGHLEN, HE
ANSWERED.</span></div>
<p>We asked his name. ''Tis Dr. Macloghlen,' he answered. 'I'm from
County Clare, ye see; and I'm on me way to Egypt for thravel and
exploration. Me fader whisht me to see the worruld a bit before I'd
settle down to practise me profession at Liscannor. Have ye ever
been in County Clare? Sure, 'tis the pick of Oireland.'<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>
<p>'We have that pleasure still in store,' I answered, smiling. 'It
spreads gold-leaf over the future, as George Meredith puts it.'</p>
<p>'Is it Meredith? Ah, there's the foine writer! 'Tis jaynius the
man has: I can't undtherstand a word of him. But he's half Oirish,
ye know. What proof have I got of it? An' would he write like that
if there wasn't a dhrop of the blood of the Celt in
him?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg
178]</a></span></p>
<p>Next day and next night, Mr. Macloghlen was our devoted slave. I
had won his heart by admitting frankly that his countrywomen had
the finest and liveliest eyes in Europe&mdash;eyes with a deep
twinkle, half fun, half passion. He took to us at once, and talked
to us incessantly. He was a red-haired, raw-boned Munster-man, but
a real good fellow. We forgot the aggressive inequalities of the
Mediterranean while he talked to us of 'the pizzantry.' Late the
second evening he propounded a confidence. It was a lovely night;
Orion overhead, and the plashing phosphorescence on the water below
conspired with the hour to make him specially confidential. 'Now,
Miss Cayley,' he said, leaning forward on his deck chair, and
gazing earnestly into my eyes, 'there's wan question I'd like to
ask ye. The ambition of me life is to get into Parlimint. And I
want to know from ye, as a frind&mdash;if I accomplish me heart's
wish&mdash;is there annything, in me apparence, ar in me voice, ar
in me accent, ar in me manner, that would lade annybody to suppose
I was an Oirishman?'</p>
<p>I succeeded, by good luck, in avoiding Elsie's eye. What on
earth could I answer? Then a happy thought struck me. 'Dr.
Macloghlen,' I said, 'it would not be the slightest use your trying
to conceal it; for even if nobody ever detected a faint Irish
intonation in your words or phrases&mdash;how could your eloquence
fail to betray you for a countryman of Sheridan and Burke and
Grattan?'</p>
<p>He seized my hand with such warmth that I thought it best to
hurry down to my state-room at once, under cover of my
compliment.</p>
<p>At Alexandria and Cairo we found him invaluable. He looked after
our luggage, which he gallantly rescued from the lean hands of
fifteen Arab porters, all eagerly<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> struggling to gain
possession of our effects; he saw us safe into the train; and he
never quitted us till he had safely ensconced us in our rooms at
Shepheard's. For himself, he said, with subdued melancholy, 'twas
to some cheaper hotel he must go; Shepheard's wasn't for the likes
of him; though if land in County Clare was wort' what it ought to
be, there wasn't a finer estate in all Oireland than his
fader's.</p>
<p>Our Mr. Elworthy was a modern proprietor, who knew how to do
things on the lordly scale. Having commissioned me to write this
series of articles, he intended them to be written in the first
style of art, and he had instructed me accordingly to hire one of
Cook's little steam dahabeeahs, where I could work at leisure. Dr.
Macloghlen was in his element arranging for the trip. 'Sure the
only thing I mind,' he said, 'is&mdash;that I'll not be going wid
ye.' I think he was half inclined to invite himself; but there
again I drew a line. I will not sell salt fish; and I will not go
up the Nile, unchaperoned, with a casual man acquaintance.</p>
<p>He did the next best thing, however: he took a place in a
sailing dahabeeah; and as we steamed up slowly, stopping often on
the way, to give me time to write my articles, he managed to arrive
almost always at every town or ruin exactly when we did.</p>
<p>I will not describe the voyage. The Nile is the Nile. Just at
first, before we got used to it, we conscientiously looked up the
name of every village we passed on the bank in our Murray and our
Baedeker. After a couple of days' Niling, however, we found that
formality quite unnecessary. They were all the same village, under
a number of aliases. They did not even take the trouble to disguise
themselves anew, like Dr. Fortescue-Langley, on each fresh
appearance. They had every one of them a small whitewashed
mosque,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg
180]</a></span> with a couple of tall minarets; and around it
spread a number of mud-built cottages, looking more like bee-hives
than human habitations. They had also every one of them a group of
date-palms, overhanging a cluster of mean bare houses; and they all
alike had a picturesque and even imposing air from a distance, but
faded away into indescribable squalor as one got abreast of them.
Our progress was monotonous. At twelve, noon, we would pass
Aboo-Teeg, with its mosque, its palms, its mud-huts, and its
camels; then for a couple of hours we would go on through the midst
of a green field on either side, studded by more mud-huts, and
backed up by a range of gray desert mountains; only to come at 2
<span class="smcap">p.m</span>., twenty miles higher up, upon
Aboo-Teeg once more, with the same mosque, the same mud-huts, and
the same haughty camels, placidly chewing the same aristocratic
cud, but under the alias of Koos-kam. After a wild hubbub at the
quay, we would leave Koos-kam behind, with its camels still
serenely munching day-before-yesterday's dinner; and twenty miles
further on, again, having passed through the same green plain,
backed by the same gray mountains, we would stop once more at the
identical Koos-kam, which this time absurdly described itself as
Tahtah. But whether it was Aboo-Teeg or Koos-kam or Tahtah or
anything else, only the name differed: it was always the same town,
and had always the same camels at precisely the same stage of the
digestive process. It seemed to us immaterial whether you saw all
the Nile or only five miles of it. It was just like wall-paper. A
sample sufficed; the whole was the sample infinitely repeated.</p>
<p>However, I had my letters to write, and I wrote them valiantly.
I described the various episodes of the complicated digestive
process in the camel in the minutest detail. I gloated over the
date-palms, which I knew in three days<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> as
if I had been brought up upon dates. I gave word-pictures of every
individual child, veiled woman, Arab sheikh, and Coptic priest whom
we encountered on the voyage. And I am open to reprint those
conscientious studies of mud-huts and minarets with any
enterprising publisher who will make me an offer.</p>

height="500" alt="TOO MUCH NILE." title=""> <span class=
"caption">TOO MUCH NILE.</span></div>
<p>Another disillusion weighed upon my soul. Before I<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> went
up the Nile, I had a fancy of my own that the bank was studded with
endless ruined temples, whose vast red colonnades were reflected in
the water at every turn. I think Macaulay's Lays were primarily
answerable for that particular misapprehension. As a matter of
fact, it surprised me to find that we often went for two whole
days' hard steaming without ever a temple breaking the monotony of
those eternal date-palms, those calm and superciliously
irresponsive camels. In my humble opinion, Egypt is a fraud; there
is too much Nile&mdash;very dirty Nile at that&mdash;and not nearly
enough temple. Besides, the temples, when you <i>do</i> come up
with them, are just like the villages; they are the same temple
over again, under a different name each time, and they have the
same gods, the same kings, the same wearisome bas-reliefs, except
that the gentleman in a chariot, ten feet high, who is mowing down
enemies a quarter his own size, with unsportsmanslike recklessness,
is called Rameses in this place, and Sethi in that, and Amen-hotep
in the other. With this trifling variation, when you have seen one
temple, one obelisk, one hieroglyphic table, you have seen the
whole of Ancient Egypt.</p>
<p>At last, after many days' voyage through the same scenery
daily&mdash;rising in the morning off a village with a mosque, ten
palms, and two minarets, and retiring late at night off the same
village once more, with mosque, palms, and minarets, as before,
<i>da capo</i>&mdash;we arrived one evening at a place called
Geergeh. In itself, I believe, Geergeh did not differ materially
from all the other places we had passed on our voyage: it had its
mosque, its ten palms, and its two minarets as usual. But I
remember its name, because something mysterious went wrong there
with our machinery; and the engineer informed us we must wait at
least three days to mend it. Dr. Macloghlen's dahabeeah
happened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg
183]</a></span> opportunely to arrive at the same spot on the same
day; and he declared with fervour he would 'see us through our
throubles.' But what on earth were we to do with ourselves through
three long days and nights at Geergeh? There were the ruins of
Abydus close at hand, to be sure; though I defy anybody not a
professed Egyptologist to give more than one day to the ruins of
Abydus. In this emergency, Dr. Macloghlen came gallantly to our
aid. He discovered by inquiring from an English-speaking guide that
there was an unobtrusive oasis, never visited by Europeans, one
long day's journey off, across the desert. As a rule, it takes at
least three days to get camels and guides together for such an
expedition: for Egypt is not a land to hurry in. But the
indefatigable Doctor further unearthed the fact that a sheikh had
just come in, who (for a consideration) would lend us camels for a
two days' trip; and we seized the chance to do our duty by Mr.
Elworthy and the world-wide circulation. An unvisited
oasis&mdash;and two Christian ladies to be the first to explore it:
there's journalistic enterprise for you! If we happened to be
killed, so much the better for the <i>Daily Telephone</i>. I
pictured the excitement at Piccadilly Circus. 'Extra Special, Our
Own Correspondent brutally murdered!' I rejoiced at the
opportunity.</p>
<p>I cannot honestly say that Elsie rejoiced with me. She cherished
a prejudice against camels, massacres, and the new journalism. She
didn't like being murdered: though this was premature, for she had
never tried it. She objected that the fanatical Mohammedans of the
Senoosi sect, who were said to inhabit the oasis in question, might
cut our throats for dogs of infidels. I pointed out to her at some
length that it was just that chance which added zest to our
expedition as a journalistic venture: fancy the glory of being the
first lady journalists martyred in the cause! But she<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
failed to grasp this aspect of the question. However, if I went,
she would go too, she said, like a dear girl that she is: she would
not desert me when I was getting my throat cut.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 423px;"><a name="ILL_046" id=

height="500" alt="EMPHASIS." title=""> <span class=
"caption">EMPHASIS.</span></div>
<p>Dr. Macloghlen made the bargain for us, and insisted on
accompanying us across the desert. He told us his method of
negotiation with the Arabs with extreme gusto. '"Is it pay in
advance ye want?" says I to the dirty beggars:<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
"divvil a penny will ye get till ye bring these ladies safe back to
Geergeh. And remimber, Mr. Sheikh," says I, fingering me pistol,
so, by way of emphasis, "we take no money wid us; so if yer friends
at Wadi Bou choose to cut our throats, 'tis for the pleasure of it
they'll be cutting them, not for anything they'll gain by it."
"Provisions, effendi?" says he, salaaming. "Provisions, is it?"
says I. "Take everything ye'll want wid you; I suppose ye can buy
food fit for a Crischun in the bazaar in Geergeh; and never wan
penny do ye touch for it all till ye've landed us on the bank
again, as safe as ye took us. So if the religious sintiments of the
faithful at Wadi Bou should lade them to hack us to pieces," says
I, just waving me revolver, "thin 'tis yerself that will be out of
pocket by it." And the ould divvil cringed as if he took me for the
Prince of Wales. Faix, 'tis the purse that's the best argumint to
catch these haythen Arabs upon.'</p>
<p>When we set out for the desert in the early dawn next day, it
looked as if we were starting for a few months' voyage. We had a
company of camels that might have befitted a caravan. We had two
large tents, one for ourselves, and one for Dr. Macloghlen, with a
third to dine in. We had bedding, and cushions, and drinking water
tied up in swollen pig-skins, which were really goat-skins, looking
far from tempting. We had bread and meat, and a supply of presents
to soften the hearts and weaken the religious scruples of the
sheikhs at Wadi Bou. 'We thravel <i>en prince</i>,' said the
Doctor. When all was ready we got under way solemnly, our camels
rising and sniffing the breeze with a superior air, as who should
say, 'I happen to be going where you happen to be going; but don't
for a moment suppose I do it to please you. It is mere coincidence.
You are bound for Wadi Bou: I have business of my own which chances
to take me there.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id=

"RIDING A CAMEL DOES NOT GREATLY DIFFER FROM SEA-SICKNESS." title=
""> <span class="caption">RIDING A CAMEL DOES NOT GREATLY DIFFER
FROM SEA-SICKNESS.</span></div>
<p>Over the incidents of the journey I draw a veil. Riding a camel,
I find, does not greatly differ from sea-sickness. They are the
same phenomenon under altered circumstances.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> We
had been assured beforehand on excellent authority that 'much of
the comfort on a desert journey depends upon having a good camel.'
On this matter, I am no authority. I do not set up as a judge of
camel-flesh. But I did not notice <i>any</i> of the comfort; so I
venture to believe my camel must have been an exceptionally bad
one.</p>
<p>We expected trouble from the fanatical natives; I am bound to
admit, we had most trouble with Elsie. She was not insubordinate,
but she did not care for camel-riding. And her beast took advantage
of her youth and innocence. A well-behaved camel should go almost
as fast as a child can walk, and should not sit down plump on the
burning sand without due reason. Elsie's brute crawled, and called
halts for prayer at frequent intervals; it tried to kneel like a
good Mussulman many times a day; and it showed an intolerant
disposition to crush the infidel by rolling over on top of Elsie.
Dr. Macloghlen admonished it with Irish eloquence, not always in
language intended for publication; but it only turned up its
supercilious lip and inquired in its own unspoken tongue what
<i>he</i> knew about the desert.</p>
<p>'I feel like a wurrum before the baste,' the Doctor said,
nonplussed.</p>
<p>If the Nile was monotonous, the road to Wadi Bou was nothing
short of dreary. We crossed a great ridge of bare, gray rock, and
followed a rolling valley of sand, scored by dry ravines, and
baking in the sun. It was ghastly to look upon. All day long, save
at the midday rest by some brackish wells, we rode on and on, the
brutes stepping forward with slow, outstretched legs; though
sometimes we walked by the camels' sides to vary the monotony; but
ever through that dreary upland plain, sand in the centre, rocky
mountain at the edge, and not a thing to look at. We were relieved
towards evening to stumble against stunted tamarisks,<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> half
buried in sand, and to feel we were approaching the edge of the
oasis.</p>
<p>When at last our arrogant beasts condescended to stop, in their
patronising way, we saw by the dim light of the moon a sort of
uneven basin or hollow, studded with date-palms, and in the midst
of the depression a crumbling walled town, with a whitewashed
mosque, two minarets by its side, and a crowd of mud-houses. It was
strangely familiar. We had come all this way just to see Aboo-Teeg
or Koos-kam over again!</p>
<p>We camped outside the fortified town that night. Next morning we
essayed to make our entry.</p>
<p>At first, the servants of the Prophet on watch at the gate
raised serious objections. No infidel might enter. But we had a
pass from Cairo, exhorting the faithful in the name of the Khedive
to give us food and shelter; and after much examination and many
loud discussions, the gatemen passed us. We entered the town, and
stood alone, three Christian Europeans, in the midst of three
thousand fanatical Mohammedans.</p>
<p>I confess it was weird. Elsie shrank by my side. 'Suppose they
were to attack us, Brownie?'</p>
<p>'Thin the sheikh here would never get paid,' Dr. Macloghlen put
in with true Irish recklessness. 'Faix, he'll whistle for his money
on the whistle I gave him.' That touch of humour saved us. We
laughed; and the people about saw we could laugh. They left off
scowling, and pressed around trying to sell us pottery and native
brooches. In the intervals of fanaticism, the Arab has an eye to
business.</p>
<p>We passed up the chief street of the bazaar. The inhabitants
told us in pantomime the chief of the town was away at Asioot,
whither he had gone two days ago on<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> business. If he were
here, our interpreter gave us to understand, things might have been
different; for the chief had determined that, whatever came, no
infidel dog should settle in <i>his</i> oasis.</p>

<span class="caption">HER AGITATION WAS EVIDENT.</span></div>
<p>The women with their veiled faces attracted us strangely. They
were wilder than on the river. They ran when one<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
looked at them. Suddenly, as we passed one, we saw her give a
little start. She was veiled like the rest, but her agitation was
evident even through her thick covering.</p>
<p>'She is afraid of Christians,' Elsie cried, nestling towards
me.</p>
<p>The woman passed close to us. She never looked in our direction,
but in a very low voice she murmured, as she passed, 'Then you are
English!'</p>
<p>I had presence of mind enough to conceal my surprise at this
unexpected utterance. 'Don't seem to notice her, Elsie,' I said,
looking away. 'Yes, we are English.'</p>
<p>She stopped and pretended to examine some jewellery on a stall.
'So am I,' she went on, in the same suppressed low voice. 'For
Heaven's sake, help me!'</p>
<p>'What are you doing here?'</p>
<p>'I live here&mdash;married. I was with Gordon's force at
Khartoum. They carried me off. A mere girl then. Now I am
thirty.'</p>
<p>'And you have been here ever since?'</p>
<p>She turned away and walked off, but kept whispering behind her
veil. We followed, unobtrusively. 'Yes; I was sold to a man at
Dongola. He passed me on again to the chief of this oasis. I don't
know where it is; but I have been here ever since. I hate this
life. Is there any chance of a rescue?'</p>
<p>'Anny chance of a rescue, is it?' the Doctor broke in, a trifle
too ostensibly. 'If it costs us a whole British Army, me dear lady,
we'll fetch you away and save you.'</p>
<p>'But now&mdash;to-day? You won't go away and leave me? You are
the first Europeans I have seen since Khartoum fell. They may sell
me again. You will not desert me?'</p>
<p>'No,' I said. 'We will not.' Then I reflected a
moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg
191]</a></span></p>
<p>What on earth could we do? This was a painful dilemma. If we
once lost sight of her, we might not see her again. Yet if we
walked with her openly, and talked like friends, we would betray
ourselves, and her, to those fanatical Senoosis.</p>
<p>I made my mind up promptly. I may not have much of a mind; but,
such as it is, I flatter myself I can make it up at a moment's
notice.</p>
<p>'Can you come to us outside the gate at sunset?' I asked, as if
speaking to Elsie.</p>
<p>The woman hesitated. 'I think so.'</p>
<p>'Then keep us in sight all day, and when evening comes, stroll
out behind us.'</p>
<p>She turned over some embroidered slippers on a booth, and seemed
to be inspecting them. 'But my children?' she murmured
anxiously.</p>
<p>The Doctor interposed. 'Is it childern she has?' he asked. 'Thin
they'll be the Mohammedan gintleman's. We mustn't interfere wid
<i>them</i>. We can take away the lady&mdash;she's English, and
detained against her will: but we can't deprive anny man of his own
childern'.</p>
<p>I was firm, and categorical. 'Yes, we can,' I said, stoutly; 'if
he has forced a woman to bear them to him whether she would or not.
That's common justice. I have no respect for the Mohammedan
gentleman's rights. Let her bring them with her. How many are
there?'</p>
<p>'Two&mdash;a boy and girl; not very old; the eldest is seven.'
She spoke wistfully. A mother is a mother.</p>
<p>'Then say no more now, but keep us always in sight, and we will
keep <i>you</i>. Come to us at the gate about sundown. We will
carry you off with us.'</p>
<p>She clasped her hands and moved off with the peculiar gliding
air of the veiled Mohammedan woman. Our eyes<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
followed her. We walked on through the bazaar, thinking of nothing
else now. It was strange how this episode made us forget our
selfish fears for our own safety. Even dear timid Elsie remembered
only that an Englishwoman's life and liberty were at stake. We kept
her more or less in view all day. She glided in and out among the
people in the alleys. When we went back to the camels at
lunch-time, she followed us unobtrusively through the open gate,
and sat watching us from a little way off, among a crowd of gazers;
for all Wadi Bou was of course agog at this unwonted invasion.</p>
<p>We discussed the circumstance loudly, so that she might hear our
plans. Dr. Macloghlen advised that we should tell our sheikh we
meant to return part of the way to Geergeh that evening by
moonlight. I quite agreed with him. It was the only way out.
Besides, I didn't like the looks of the people. They eyed us
askance. This was getting exciting now. I felt a professional
journalistic interest. Whether we escaped or got killed, what
splendid business for the <i>Daily Telephone</i>!</p>
<p>The sheikh, of course, declared it was impossible to start that
evening. The men wouldn't move&mdash;the camels needed rest. But
Dr. Macloghlen was inexorable. 'Very well, thin, Mr. Sheikh,' he
answered, philosophically. 'Ye'll plaze yerself about whether ye
come on wid us or whether ye shtop. That's yer own business. But
<i>we</i> set out at sundown; and whin ye return by yerself on foot
to Geergeh, ye can ask for yer camels at the British
Consulate.'</p>
<p>All through that anxious afternoon we sat in our tents, under
the shade of the mud-wall, wondering whether we could carry out our
plan or not. About an hour before sunset the veiled woman strolled
out of the gate with her two children. She joined the crowd of
sight-seers once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id=
"Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> more, for never through the day were
we left alone for a second. The excitement grew intense. Elsie and
I moved up carelessly towards the group, talking as if to one
another. I looked hard at Elsie: then I said, as though I were
speaking about one of the children, 'Go straight along the road to
Geergeh till you are past the big clump of palms at the edge of the
oasis. Just beyond it comes a sharp ridge of rock. Wait behind the
ridge where no one can see you. When we get there,' I patted the
little girl's head, 'don't say a word, but jump on my camel. My two
friends will each take one of the children. If you understand and
consent, stroke your boy's curls. We will accept that for a
signal.'</p>
<p>She stroked the child's head at once without the least
hesitation. Even through her veil and behind her dress, I could
somehow feel and see her trembling nerves, her beating heart. But
she gave no overt token. She merely turned and muttered something
carelessly in Arabic to a woman beside her.</p>
<p>We waited once more, in long-drawn suspense. Would she manage to
escape them? Would they suspect her motives?</p>
<p>After ten minutes, when we had returned to our crouching-place
under the shadow of the wall, the woman detached herself slowly
from the group, and began strolling with almost overdone
nonchalance along the road to Geergeh. We could see the little girl
was frightened and seemed to expostulate with her mother:
fortunately, the Arabs about were too much occupied in watching the
suspicious strangers to notice this episode of their own people.
Presently, our new friend disappeared; and, with beating hearts, we
awaited the sunset.</p>

<span class="caption">CROUCHING BY THE ROCKS SAT OUR MYSTERIOUS
STRANGER.</span></div>
<p>Then came the usual scene of hubbub with the sheikh, the camels,
the porters, and the drivers. It was eagerness<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
against apathy. With difficulty we made them understand we meant to
get under way at all hazards. I stormed in bad Arabic. The Doctor
inveighed in very choice Irish. At last they yielded, and set out.
One by one the camels rose, bent their slow knees, and began to
stalk in their lordly way with outstretched necks along the road to
the river. We moved through the palm groves, a crowd of boys
following us and shouting for backsheesh. We began to be afraid
they would accompany us too far and discover our fugitive; but
fortunately they all turned back with one accord at a little
whitewashed shrine near the edge of the oasis. We reached the clump
of palms; we turned the corner of the ridge. Had we missed one
another? No! There, crouching<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> by the rocks, with her
children by her side, sat our mysterious stranger.</p>
<p>The Doctor was equal to the emergency. 'Make those bastes
kneel!' he cried authoritatively to the sheikh.</p>
<p>The sheikh was taken aback. This was a new exploit burst upon
him. He flung his arms up, gesticulating wildly. The Doctor,
unmoved, made the drivers understand by some strange pantomime what
he wanted. They nodded, half terrified. In a second, the stranger
was by my side, Elsie had taken the girl, the Doctor the boy, and
the camels were passively beginning to rise again. That is the best
of your camel. Once set him on his road, and he goes
mechanically.</p>
<p>The sheikh broke out with several loud remarks in Arabic, which
we did not understand, but whose hostile character could not easily
escape us. He was beside himself with anger. Then I was suddenly
aware of the splendid advantage of having an Irishman on our side.
Dr. Macloghlen drew his revolver, like one well used to such
episodes, and pointed it full at the angry Arab. 'Look here, Mr.
Sheikh,' he said, calmly, yet with a fine touch of bravado; 'do ye
see this revolver? Well, unless ye make yer camels thravel
sthraight to Geergeh widout wan other wurrud, 'tis yer own brains
will be spattered, sor, on the sand of this desert! And if ye touch
wan hair of our heads, ye'll answer for it wid yer life to the
British Government.'</p>
<p>I do not feel sure that the sheikh comprehended the exact nature
of each word in this comprehensive threat, but I am certain he took
in its general meaning, punctuated as it was with some flourishes
of the revolver. He turned to the drivers and made a gesture of
despair. It meant, apparently, that this infidel was too much for
him. Then he called out a few sharp directions in Arabic. Next
minute,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg
196]</a></span> our camels' legs were stepping out briskly along
the road to Geergeh with a promptitude which I'm sure must have
astonished their owners. We rode on and on through the gloom in a
fever of suspense. Had any of the Senoosis noticed our presence?
Would they miss the chief's wife before long, and follow us under
arms? Would our own sheikh betray us? I am no coward, as women go,
but I confess, if it had not been for our fiery Irishman, I should
have felt my heart sink. We were grateful to him for the reckless
and good-humoured courage of the untamed Celt. It kept us from
giving way. 'Ye'll take notice, Mr. Sheikh,' he said, as we
threaded our way among the moon-lit rocks, 'that I have twinty-wan
cartridges in me case for me revolver; and that if there's throuble
to-night, 'tis twinty of them there'll be for your frinds the
Senoosis, and wan for yerself; but for fear of disappointing a
gintleman, 'tis yer own special bullet I'll disthribute first, if
it comes to fighting.'</p>
<p>The sheikh's English was a vanishing quantity, but to judge by
the way he nodded and salaamed at this playful remark, I am
convinced he understood the Doctor's Irish quite as well as I
did.</p>
<p>We spoke little by the way; we were all far too frightened,
except the Doctor, who kept our hearts up by a running fire of wild
Celtic humour. But I found time meanwhile to learn by a few
questions from our veiled friend something of her captivity. She
had seen her father massacred before her eyes at Khartoum, and had
then been sold away to a merchant, who conveyed her by degrees and
by various exchanges across the desert through lonely spots to the
Senoosi oasis. There she had lived all those years with the chief
to whom her last purchaser had trafficked her. She did not even
know that her husband's village was an integral part of the
Khedive's territory; far less that the English were now
in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg
197]</a></span> practical occupation of Egypt. She had heard
nothing and learnt nothing since that fateful day; she had waited
in vain for the off-chance of a deliverer.</p>
<p>'But did you never try to run away to the Nile?' I cried,
astonished.</p>
<p>'Run away? How could I? I did not even know which way the river
lay; and was it possible for me to cross the desert on foot, or
find the chance of a camel? The Senoosis would have killed me. Even
with you to help me, see what dangers surround me; alone, I should
have perished, like Hagar in the wilderness, with no angel to save
me.'</p>
<p>'An' ye've got the angel now,' Dr. Macloghlen exclaimed,
glancing at me. 'Steady, there, Mr. Sheikh. What's this that's
coming?'</p>
<p>It was another caravan, going the opposite way, on its road to
the oasis! A voice halloaed from it.</p>
<p>Our new friend clung tight to me. 'My husband!' she whispered,
gasping.</p>
<p>They were still far off on the desert, and the moon shone
bright. A few hurried words to the Doctor, and with a wild resolve
we faced the emergency. He made the camels halt, and all of us,
springing off, crouched down behind their shadows in such a way
that the coming caravan must pass on the far side of us. At the
same moment the Doctor turned resolutely to the sheikh. 'Look here,
Mr. Arab,' he said in a quiet voice, with one more appeal to the
simple Volapuk of the pointed revolver; 'I cover ye wid this. Let
these frinds of yours go by. If there's anny unnecessary talking
betwixt ye, or anny throuble of anny kind, remimber, the first
bullet goes sthraight as an arrow t'rough that haythen head of
yours!'</p>
<p>The sheikh salaamed more submissively than ever.</p>
<p>The caravan drew abreast of us. We could hear them<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> cry
aloud on either side the customary salutes: 'In Allah's name,
peace!' answered by 'Allah is great; there is no god but
Allah.'</p>
<p>Would anything more happen? Would our sheikh play us false? It
was a moment of breathlessness. We crouched and cowered in the
shade, holding our hearts with fear, while the Arab drivers
pretended to be unsaddling the camels. A minute or two of anxious
suspense; then, peering over our beasts' backs, we saw their long
line filing off towards the oasis. We watched their turbaned heads,
silhouetted against the sky, disappear slowly. One by one they
faded away. The danger was past. With beating hearts we rose up
again.</p>
<p>The Doctor sprang into his place and seated himself on his
camel. 'Now ride on, Mr. Sheikh,' he said, 'wid all yer men, as if
grim death was afther ye. Camels or no camels, ye've got to march
all night, for ye'll never draw rein till we're safe back at
Geergeh!'</p>
<p>And sure enough we never halted, under the persuasive influence
of that loaded revolver, till we dismounted once more in the early
dawn upon the Nile bank, under British protection.</p>
<p>Then Elsie and I and our rescued country-woman broke down
together in an orgy of relief. We hugged one another and cried like
so many children.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id=

<h3>THE ADVENTURE OF THE PEA-GREEN PATRICIAN</h3>
<p>Away to India! A life on the ocean wave once more; and&mdash;may
it prove less wavy!</p>
<p>In plain prose, my arrangement with 'my proprietor,' Mr.
Elworthy (thus we speak in the newspaper trade), included a trip to
Bombay for myself and Elsie. So, as soon as we had drained Upper
Egypt journalistically dry, we returned to Cairo on our road to
Suez. I am glad to say, my letters to the <i>Daily Telephone</i>
gave satisfaction. My employer wrote, 'You are a born journalist.'
I confess this surprised me; for I have always considered myself a
truthful person. Still, as he evidently meant it for praise, I took
the doubtful compliment in good part, and offered no
remonstrance.</p>
<p>I have a mercurial temperament. My spirits rise and fall as if
they were Consols. Monotonous Egypt depressed me, as it depressed
the Israelites; but the passage of the Red Sea set me sounding my
timbrel. I love fresh air; I love the sea, if the sea will but
behave itself; and I positively revelled in the change from
Egypt.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we had taken our passages by a P. and O. steamer
from Suez to Bombay many weeks beforehand, so as to secure good
berths; and still more unfortunately, in<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> a
letter to Lady Georgina, I had chanced to mention the name of our
ship and the date of the voyage. I kept up a spasmodic
correspondence with Lady Georgina nowadays&mdash;tuppence-ha'penny
a fortnight; the dear, cantankerous, racy old lady had been the
foundation of my fortunes, and I was genuinely grateful to her; or,
rather, I ought to say, she had been their second foundress, for I
will do myself the justice to admit that the first was my own
initiative and enterprise. I flatter myself I have the knack of
taking the tide on the turn, and I am justly proud of it. But,
being a grateful animal, I wrote once a fortnight to report
progress to Lady Georgina. Besides&mdash;let me
whisper&mdash;strictly between ourselves&mdash;'twas an indirect
way of hearing about Harold.</p>
<p>This time, however, as events turned out, I recognised that I
had made a grave mistake in confiding my movements to my shrewd old
lady. She did not betray me on purpose, of course; but I gathered
later that casually in conversation she must have mentioned the
fact and date of my sailing before somebody who ought to have had
no concern in it; and the somebody, I found, had governed himself
accordingly. All this, however, I only discovered afterwards. So,
without anticipating, I will narrate the facts exactly as they
occurred to me.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 253px;"><a name="ILL_050" id=

height="500" alt="AN ODD-LOOKING YOUNG MAN." title=""> <span class=
"caption">AN ODD-LOOKING YOUNG MAN.</span></div>
<p>When we mounted the gangway of the <i>Jumna</i> at Suez, and
began the process of frizzling down the Red Sea, I noted on deck
almost at once an odd-looking young man of twenty-two or
thereabouts, with a curious faint pea-green complexion. He was the
wishy-washiest young man I ever beheld in my life; an achromatic
study: in spite of the delicate pea-greeniness of his skin, all the
colouring matter of the body seemed somehow to have faded out of
him. Perhaps he had been bleached. As he leant over the<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
taffrail, gazing down with open mouth and vacant stare at the
water, I took a good long look at him. He interested me
much&mdash;because he was so exceptionally uninteresting; a pallid,
an&aelig;mic, indefinite hobbledehoy, with a high, narrow forehead,
and sketchy features. He had watery, restless eyes of an insipid
light blue; thin, yellow hair, almost white in its paleness; and
twitching hands that played nervously all the time with a shadowy
moustache. This shadowy moustache seemed to absorb as a rule the
best part of his attention; it was so sparse and so blanched that
he felt it continually&mdash;to assure himself, no doubt, of the
reality of its existence. I need hardly add that he wore an
eye-glass.</p>
<p>He was an aristocrat, I felt sure; Eton and Christ Church: no
ordinary person could have been quite so flavourless. Imbecility
like his is only to be attained as the result of long and judicious
selection.</p>
<p>He went on gazing in a vacant way at the water
below,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg
202]</a></span> an ineffectual patrician smile playing feebly round
the corners of his mouth meanwhile. Then he turned and stared at me
as I lay back in my deck-chair. For a minute he looked me over as
if I were a horse for sale. When he had finished inspecting me, he
beckoned to somebody at the far end of the quarter-deck.</p>
<p>The somebody sidled up with a deferential air which confirmed my
belief in the pea-green young man's aristocratic origin. It was
such deference as the British flunkey pays only to blue blood; for
he has gradations of flunkeydom. He is respectful to wealth; polite
to acquired rank; but servile only to hereditary nobility. Indeed,
you can make a rough guess at the social status of the person he
addresses by observing which one of his twenty-seven nicely
graduated manners he adopts in addressing him.</p>
<p>The pea-green young man glanced over in my direction, and
murmured something to the satellite, whose back was turned towards
me. I felt sure, from his attitude, he was asking whether I was the
person he suspected me to be. The satellite nodded assent, whereat
the pea-green young man, screwing up his face to fix his eye-glass,
stared harder than ever. He must be heir to a peerage, I felt
convinced; nobody short of that rank would consider himself
entitled to stare with such frank unconcern at an unknown lady.</p>
<p>Presently it further occurred to me that the satellite's back
seemed strangely familiar. 'I have seen that man somewhere, Elsie,'
I whispered, putting aside the wisps of hair that blew about my
face.</p>
<p>'So have I, dear,' Elsie answered, with a slight shudder. And I
was instinctively aware that I too disliked him.</p>
<p>As Elsie spoke, the man turned, and strolled slowly past us,
with that ineffable insolence which is the other side of the
flunkey's insufferable self-abasement. He cast a glance<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> at
us as he went by, a withering glance of brazen effrontery. We knew
him now, of course: it was that variable star, our old
acquaintance, Mr. Higginson the courier.</p>
<p>He was here as himself this time; no longer the count or the
mysterious faith-healer. The diplomat hid his rays under the garb
of the man-servant.</p>
<p>'Depend upon it, Elsie,' I cried, clutching her arm with a vague
sense of fear, 'this man means mischief. There is danger ahead.
When a creature of Higginson's sort, who has risen to be a count
and a fashionable physician, descends again to be a courier, you
may rest assured it is because he has something to gain by it. He
has some deep scheme afloat. And <i>we</i> are part of it.'</p>
<p>'His master looks weak enough and silly enough for anything,'
Elsie answered, eyeing the suspected lordling. 'I should think he
is just the sort of man such a wily rogue would naturally fasten
upon.'</p>
<p>'When a wily rogue gets hold of a weak fool, who is also
dishonest,' I said, 'the two together may make a formidable
combination. But never mind. We're forewarned. I think I shall be
even with him.'</p>
<p>That evening, at dinner in the saloon, the pea-green young man
strolled in with a jaunty air and took his seat next to us. The Red
Sea, by the way, was kinder than the Mediterranean: it allowed us
to dine from the very first evening. Cards had been laid on the
plates to mark our places. I glanced at my neighbour's. It bore the
inscription, 'Viscount Southminster.'</p>
<p>That was the name of Lord Kynaston's eldest son&mdash;Lady
Georgina's nephew; Harold Tillington's cousin! So <i>this</i> was
the man who might possibly inherit Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst's money! I
remembered now how often and how fervently Lady Georgina had said,
'Kynaston's sons are all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204"
id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> fools.' If the rest came up to
sample, I was inclined to agree with her.</p>
<p>It also flashed across me that Lord Southminster might have
heard through Higginson of our meeting with Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst
at Florence, and of my acquaintance with Harold Tillington at
Schlangenbad and Lungern. With a woman's instinct, I jumped at the
fact that the pea-green young man had taken passage by this boat,
on purpose to baffle both me and Harold.</p>
<p>Thinking it over, it seemed to me, too, that he might have
various possible points of view on the matter. He might desire, for
example, that Harold should marry me, under the impression that his
marriage with a penniless outsider would annoy his uncle; for the
pea-green young man doubtless thought that I was still to Mr.
Ashurst just that dreadful adventuress. If so, his obvious cue
would be to promote a good understanding between Harold and myself,
in order to make us marry, so that the urbane old gentlemen might
then disinherit his favourite nephew, and make a new will in Lord
Southminster's interest. Or again, the pea-green young man might,
on the contrary, be aware that Mr. Ashurst and I had got on
admirably together when we met at Florence; in which case his aim
would naturally be to find out something that might set the rich
uncle against me. Yet once more, he might merely have heard that I
had drawn up Uncle Marmaduke's will at the office, and he might
desire to worm the contents of it out of me. Whichever was his
design, I resolved to be upon my guard in every word I said to him,
and leave no door open to any trickery either way. For of one thing
I felt sure, that the colourless young man had torn himself away
from the mud-honey of Piccadilly for this voyage to India only
because he had heard there was a chance of meeting me.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>
<p>That was a politic move, whoever planned it&mdash;himself or
Higginson; for a week on board ship with a person or persons is the
very best chance of getting thrown in with them; whether they like
it or lump it, they can't easily avoid you.</p>
<p>It was while I was pondering these things in my mind, and
resolving with myself not to give myself away, that the young man
with the pea-green face lounged in and dropped into the next seat
to me. He was dressed (amongst other things) in a dinner jacket and
a white tie; for myself, I detest such fopperies on board ship;
they seem to me out of place; they conflict with the infinite
possibilities of the situation. One stands too near the realities
of things. Evening dress and <i>mal-de-mer</i> sort ill
together.</p>

height="314" alt="HE TURNED TO ME WITH AN INANE SMILE." title="">
<span class="caption">HE TURNED TO ME WITH AN INANE
SMILE.</span></div>
<p>As my neighbour sat down, he turned to me with an inane smile
which occupied all his face. 'Good evening,' he said, in a baronial
drawl. 'Miss Cayley, I gathah? I asked the skippah's leave to set
next yah. We ought to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206"
id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> friends&mdash;rathah. I think yah
know my poor deah old aunt, Lady Georgina Fawley.'</p>
<p>I bowed a somewhat, freezing bow. 'Lady Georgina is one of my
dearest friends,' I answered.</p>
<p>'No, really? Poor deah old Georgey! Got somebody to stick up for
her at last, has she? Now that's what I call chivalrous of yah.
Magnanimous, isn't it? I like to see people stick up for their
friends. And it must be a novelty for Georgey. For between you and
me, a moah cantankerous spiteful acidulated old cough-drop than the
poor deah soul it 'ud be difficult to hit upon.'</p>
<p>'Lady Georgina has brains,' I answered; 'and they enable her to
recognise a fool when she sees him. I will admit that she does not
suffer fools gladly.'</p>
<p>He turned to me with a sudden sharp look in the depths of the
lack-lustre eyes. Already it began to strike me that, though the
pea-green young man was inane, he had his due proportion of a
certain insidious practical cunning. 'That's true,' he answered,
measuring me. 'And according to her, almost everybody's a
fool&mdash;especially her relations. There's a fine knack of
sweeping generalisation about deah skinny old Georgey. The few
people she reahlly likes are all archangels; the rest are
blithering idiots; there's no middle course with her.'</p>
<p>I held my peace frigidly.</p>
<p>'She thinks me a very special and peculiah fool,' he went on,
crumbling his bread.</p>
<p>'Lady Georgina,' I answered, 'is a person of exceptional
discrimination. I would almost always accept her judgment on anyone
as practically final.'</p>
<p>He laid down his soup-spoon, fondled the imperceptible moustache
with his tapering fingers, and then broke once more into a cheerful
expanse of smile which reminded me of<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> nothing so much as of
the village idiot. It spread over his face as the splash from a
stone spreads over a mill-pond. 'Now that's a nice cheerful sort of
thing to say to a fellah,' he ejaculated, fixing his eye-glass in
his eye, with a few fierce contortions of his facial muscles.
'That's encouraging, don't yah know, as the foundation of an
acquaintance. Makes a good cornah-stone. Calculated to place things
at once upon what yah call a friendly basis. Georgey said you had a
pretty wit; I see now why she admiahed it. Birds of a feathah: very
wise old proverb.'</p>
<p>I reflected that, after all, this young man had nothing overt
against him, beyond a fishy blue eye and an inane expression; so,
feeling that I had perhaps gone a little too far, I continued after
a minute, 'And your uncle, how is he?'</p>
<p>'Marmy?' he inquired, with another elephantine smile; and then I
perceived it was a form of humour with him (or rather, a cheap
substitute) to speak of his elder relations by their abbreviated
Christian names, without any prefix. 'Marmy's doing very well,
thank yah; as well as could be expected. In fact, bettah. Habakkuk
on the brain: it's carrying him off at last. He has Bright's
disease very bad&mdash;drank port, don't yah know&mdash;and won't
trouble this wicked world much longah with his presence. It will be
a happy release&mdash;especially for his nephews.'</p>
<p>I was really grieved, for I had grown to like the urbane old
gentleman, as I had grown to like the cantankerous old lady. In
spite of his fussiness and his Stock Exchange views on the
interpretation of Scripture, his genuine kindliness and his real
liking for me had softened my heart to him; and my face must have
shown my distress, for the pea-green young man added quickly with
an afterthought: 'But <i>you</i> needn't be afraid, yah know. It's
all right for Harold Tillington. You ought to know that as well as
anyone&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id=
"Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> bettah: for it was you who drew up
his will for him at Florence.'</p>
<p>I flushed crimson, I believe. Then he knew all about me! 'I was
not asking on Mr. Tillington's account,' I answered. 'I asked
because I have a personal feeling of friendship for your uncle, Mr.
Ashurst.'</p>
<p>His hand strayed up to the straggling yellow hairs on his upper
lip once more, and he smiled again, this time with a curious
undercurrent of foolish craftiness. 'That's a good one,' he
answered. 'Georgey told me you were original. Marmy's a
millionaire, and many people love millionaires for their money. But
to love Marmy for himself&mdash; I do call that originality! Why,
weight for age, he's acknowledged to be the most portentous old
boah in London society!'</p>
<p>'I like Mr. Ashurst because he has a kind heart and some genuine
instincts,' I answered. 'He has not allowed all human feeling to be
replaced by a cheap mask of Pall Mall cynicism.'</p>
<p>'Oh, I say; how's that for preaching? Don't you manage to give
it hot to a fellah, neithah! And at sight, too, without the usual
three days of grace. Have some of my champagne? I'm a forgiving
creachah.'</p>
<p>'No, thank you. I prefer this hock.'</p>
<p>'Your friend, then?' And he motioned the steward to pass the
bottle.</p>
<p>To my great disgust, Elsie held out her glass. I was annoyed at
that. It showed she had missed the drift of our conversation, and
was therefore lacking in feminine intuition. I should be sorry if I
had allowed the higher mathematics to kill out in me the most
distinctively womanly faculty.</p>
<p>From that first day forth, however, in spite of this beginning,
Lord Southminster almost persecuted me with<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> his
persistent attentions. He did all a fellah could possibly do to
please me. I could not make out precisely what he was driving at;
but I saw he had some artful game of his own to play, and that he
was playing it subtly. I also saw that, vapid as he was, his
vapidity did not prevent him from being worldly wise with the
wisdom of the self-seeking man of the world, who utterly distrusts
and disbelieves in all the higher emotions of humanity. He harped
so often on this string that on our second day out, as we lolled on
deck in the heat, I had to rebuke him sharply. He had been sneering
for some hours. 'There are two kinds of silly simplicity, Lord
Southminster,' I said, at last. 'One kind is the silly simplicity
of the rustic who trusts everybody; the other kind is the silly
simplicity of the Pall Mall clubman who trusts nobody. It is just
as foolish and just as one-sided to overlook the good as to
overlook the evil in humanity. If you trust everyone, you are
likely to be taken in; but if you trust no one, you put yourself at
a serious practical disadvantage, besides losing half the joy of
living.'</p>
<p>'Then you think me a fool, like Georgey?' he broke out.</p>
<p>'I should never be rude enough to say so,' I answered, fanning
myself.</p>
<p>'Well, you're what I call a first-rate companion for a voyage
down the Red Sea,' he put in, gazing abstractedly at the awnings.
'Such a lovely freezing mixture! A fellah doesn't need ices when
<i>you're</i> on tap. I recommend you as a refrigeratah.'</p>
<p>'I am glad,' I answered demurely, 'if I have secured your
approbation in that humble capacity. I'm sure I have tried hard for
it.'</p>

<span class="caption">NOTHING SEEMED TO PUT THE MAN
DOWN.</span></div>
<p>Yet nothing that I could say seemed to put the man down. In
spite of rebuffs, he was assiduous in running<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> down
the companion-ladder for my parasol or my smelling-bottle; he
fetched me chairs; he stayed me with cushions; he offered to lend
me books; he pestered me to drink his wine; and he kept Elsie in
champagne, which she annoyed me by accepting. Poor dear Elsie
clearly failed to understand the creature. 'He's so kind and
polite, Brownie, isn't he?' she would observe in her simple
fashion. 'Do you know, I think he's taken quite a fancy to you! And
he'll be an earl by-and-by. I call it romantic. How lovely it would
seem, dear, to see you a countess.'</p>
<p>'Elsie,' I said severely, with one hand on her arm, 'you are a
dear little soul, and I am very fond of you; but if you<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
think I could sell myself for a coronet to a pasty-faced young man
with a pea-green complexion and glassy blue eyes&mdash;I can only
say, my child, you have misread my character. He isn't a man: he's
a lump of putty!'</p>
<p>I think Elsie was quite shocked that I should apply these terms
to a courtesy lord, the eldest son of a peer. Nature had endowed
her with the profound British belief that peers should be spoken of
in choice and peculiar language. 'If a peer's a fool,' Lady
Georgina said once to me, 'people think you should say his
temperament does not fit him for the conduct of affairs: if he's a
rou&eacute; or a drunkard, they think you should say he has
unfortunate weaknesses.'</p>
<p>What most of all convinced me, however, that the wishy-washy
young man with the pea-green complexion must be playing some
stealthy game, was the demeanour and mental attitude of Mr.
Higginson, his courier. After the first day, Higginson appeared to
be politeness and deference itself to us. He behaved to us both,
<i>almost</i> as if we belonged to the titled classes. He treated
us with the second best of his twenty-seven graduated manners. He
fetched and carried for us with a courtly grace which recalled that
distinguished diplomat, the Comte de Laroche-sur-Loiret, at the
station at Malines with Lady Georgina. It is true, at his politest
moments, I often caught the undercurrent of a wicked twinkle in his
eye, and felt sure he was doing it all with some profound motive.
But his external demeanour was everything that one could desire
from a well-trained man-servant; I could hardly believe it was the
same man who had growled to me at Florence, 'I shall be even with
you yet,' as he left our office.</p>
<p>'Do you know, Brownie,' Elsie mused once, 'I really begin to
think we must have misjudged Higginson. He's<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> so
extremely polite. Perhaps, after all, he is really a count, who has
been exiled and impoverished for his political opinions.'</p>
<p>I smiled and held my tongue. Silence costs nothing. But Mr.
Higginson's political opinions, I felt sure, were of that simple
communistic sort which the law in its blunt way calls fraudulent.
They consisted in a belief that all was his which he could lay his
hands on.</p>
<p>'Higginson's a splendid fellah for his place, yah know, Miss
Cayley,' Lord Southminster said to me one evening as we were
approaching Aden. 'What I like about him is, he's so doosid
intelligent.'</p>
<p>'Extremely so,' I answered. Then the devil entered into me
again. 'He had the doosid intelligence even to take in Lady
Georgina.'</p>
<p>'Yaas; that's just it, don't you know. Georgey told me that
story. Screamingly funny, wasn't it? And I said to myself at once,
"Higginson's the man for me. I want a courier with jolly lots of
brains and no blooming scruples. I'll entice this chap away from
Marmy." And I did. I outbid Marmy. Oh, yaas, he's a first-rate
fellah, Higginson. What <i>I</i> want is a man who will do what
he's told, and ask no beastly unpleasant questions. Higginson's
that man. He's as sharp as a ferret.'</p>
<p>'And as dishonest as they make them.'</p>
<p>He opened his hands with a gesture of unconcern. 'All the bettah
for my purpose. See how frank I am, Miss Cayley. I tell the truth.
The truth is very rare. You ought to respect me for it.'</p>
<p>'It depends somewhat upon the <i>kind</i> of truth,' I answered,
with a random shot. 'I don't respect a man, for instance, for
confessing to a forgery.'</p>
<p>He winced. Not for months after did I know how a<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
stone thrown at a venture had chanced to hit the spot, and had
vastly enhanced his opinion of my cleverness.</p>
<p>'You have heard about Dr. Fortescue-Langley too, I suppose?' I
went on.</p>
<p>'Oh, yaas. Wasn't it real jam? He did the doctor-trick on a lady
in Switzerland. And the way he has come it ovah deah simple old
Marmy! He played Marmy with Ezekiel! Not so dusty, was it? He's too
lovely for anything!'</p>
<p>'He's an edged tool,' I said.</p>
<p>'Yaas; that's why I use him.'</p>
<p>'And edged tools may cut the user's fingers.'</p>

<p>'Not mine,' he answered, taking out a cigarette. 'Oh deah no. He
can't turn against <i>me</i>. He wouldn't dare to. Yah see, I have
the fellah entirely in my powah. I know all his little games, and I
can expose him any day. But it suits me to keep him. I don't mind
telling yah, since I respect your intellect, that he and I are
engaged in pulling off a big <i>coup</i> togethah. If it were not
for that, I wouldn't be heah. Yah don't catch me going away so fah
from Newmarket and the Empire for nothing.'</p>
<p>'I judged as much,' I answered. And then I was silent.</p>
<p>But I wondered to myself why the neutral-tinted young man should
be so communicative to an obviously hostile stranger.</p>
<p>For the next few days it amused me to see how hard our lordling
tried to suit his conversation to myself and Elsie. He was absurdly
anxious to humour us. Just at first, it is true, he had discussed
the subjects that lay nearest to his own heart. He was an ardent
votary of the noble quadruped; and he loved the turf&mdash;whose
sward, we judged, he trod mainly at Tattersall's. He spoke to us
with erudition on 'two-year-old form,' and gave us several 'safe
things'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg
214]</a></span> for the spring handicaps. The Oaks he considered 'a
moral' for Clorinda. He also retailed certain choice anecdotes
about ladies whose Christian names were chiefly Tottie and Flo, and
whose honoured surnames have escaped my memory. Most of them
flourished, I recollect, at the Frivolity Music Hall. But when he
learned that our interest in the noble quadruped was scarcely more
than tepid, and that we had never even visited 'the Friv.,' as he
affectionately called it, he did his best in turn to acquire our
subjects. He had heard us talk about Florence, for example, and he
gathered from our talk that we loved its art treasures. So he set
himself to work to be studiously artistic. It was<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> a
beautiful study in human ineptitude. 'Ah, yaas,' he, murmured,
turning up the pale blue eyes ecstatically towards the mast-head.
'Chawming place, Florence! I dote on the pickchahs. I know them all
by heart. I assuah yah, I've spent houahs and houahs feeding my
soul in the galleries.'</p>
<p>'And what particular painter does your soul most feed upon?' I
asked bluntly, with a smile.</p>
<p>The question staggered him. I could see him hunting through the
vacant chambers of his brain for a Florentine painter. Then a faint
light gleamed in the leaden eyes, and he fingered the
straw-coloured moustache with that nervous hand till he almost put
a visible point upon it. 'Ah, Raphael?' he said, tentatively, with
an inquiring air, yet beaming at his success. 'Don't you think so?
Splendid artist, Raphael!'</p>
<p>'And a very safe guess,' I answered, leading him on. 'You can't
go far wrong in mentioning Raphael, can you? But after him?'</p>
<p>He dived into the recesses of his memory again, peered about him
for a minute or two, and brought back nothing. 'I can't remembah
the othah fellahs' names,' he went on; 'they're all so much alike:
all in <i>elli</i>, don't yah know; but I recollect at the time
they impressed me awfully.'</p>
<p>'No doubt,' I answered.</p>
<p>He tried to look through me, and failed. Then he plunged, like a
noble sportsman that he was, on a second fetch of memory.
'Ah&mdash;and Michael Angelo,' he went on, quite proud of his
treasure-trove. 'Sweet things, Michael Angelo's!'</p>
<p>'Very sweet,' I admitted. 'So simple; so touching; so tender; so
domestic!'</p>
<p>I thought Elsie would explode; but she kept her countenance. The
pea-green young man gazed at me<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> uneasily. He had half
an idea by this time that I was making game of him.</p>
<p>However, he fished up a name once more, and clutched at it.
'Savonarola, too,' he adventured. 'I adore Savonarola. His
pickchahs are beautiful.'</p>
<p>'And so rare!' Elsie murmured.</p>
<p>'Then there is Fra Diavolo?' I suggested, going one better. 'How
do you like Fra Diavolo?'</p>
<p>He seemed to have heard the name before, but still he hesitated.
'Ah&mdash;what did he paint?' he asked, with growing caution.</p>
<p>I stuffed him valiantly. 'Those charming angels, you know,' I
answered. 'With the roses and the glories!'</p>
<p>'Oh, yaas; I recollect. All askew, aren't they; like<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
this! I remembah them very well. But&mdash;&mdash;' a doubt flitted
across his brain, 'wasn't his name Fra Angelico?'</p>
<p>'His brother,' I replied, casting truth to the winds. 'They
worked together, you must have heard. One did the saints; the other
did the opposite. Division of labour, don't you see; Fra Angelico,
Fra Diavolo.'</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="ILL_054" id=

height="378" alt="WASN&#39;T FRA DIAVOLO ALSO A COMPOSAH?" title=
""> <span class="caption">WASN&#39;T FRA DIAVOLO ALSO A
COMPOSAH?</span></div>
<p>He fingered his cigarette with a dubious hand, and wriggled his
eye-glass tighter. 'Yaas, beautiful; beautiful! But&mdash;&mdash;'
growing suspicious apace, 'wasn't Fra Diavolo also a composah?'</p>
<p>'Of course,' I assented. 'In his off time, he composed. Those
early Italians&mdash;so versatile, you see; so versatile!'</p>
<p>He had his doubts, but he suppressed them.</p>
<p>'And Torricelli,' I went on, with a side glance at Elsie, who
was choking by this time. 'And Chianti, and Frittura, and
Cinquevalli, and Giulio Romano.'</p>
<p>His distrust increased. 'Now you're trying to make me commit
myself,' he drawled out. 'I remembah Torricelli&mdash;he's the
fellah who used to paint all his women crooked. But Chianti's a
wine; I've often drunk it; and Romano's&mdash;well, every fellah
knows Romano's is a restaurant near the Gaiety Theatre.'</p>
<p>'Besides,' I continued, in a drawl like his own, 'there are
Risotto, and Gnocchi, and Vermicelli, and Anchovy&mdash;all famous
paintahs, and all of whom I don't doubt you admiah.'</p>
<p>Elsie exploded at last. But he took no offence. He smiled
inanely, as if he rather enjoyed it. 'Look heah, you know,' he
said, with his crafty smile; 'that's one too much. I'm not taking
any. You think yourselves very clevah for kidding me with paintahs
who are really macaroni and cheese and claret; yet if I were to
tell you the Lejah was run at Ascot, or the Cesarewitch at
Doncastah, why, you'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id=
"Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> be no wisah. When it comes to art, I
don't have a look in; but I could tell you a thing or two about
starting prices.'</p>
<p>And I was forced to admit that there he had reason.</p>
<p>Still, I think he realised that he had better avoid the subject
of art in future, as we avoided the noble quadruped. He saw his
limitations.</p>
<p>Not till the last evening before we reached Bombay did I really
understand the nature of my neighbour's project. That evening, as
it chanced, Elsie had a headache and went below early. I stopped
with her till she dozed off; then I slipped up on deck once more
for a breath of fresh air, before retiring for the night to the hot
and stuffy cabin. It was an exquisite evening. The moon rode in the
pale green sky of the tropics. A strange light still lingered on
the western horizon. The stifling heat of the Red Sea had given way
long since to the refreshing coolness of the Indian Ocean. I
strolled a while on the quarter-deck, and sat down at last near the
stern. Next moment, I was aware of somebody creeping up to me.</p>
<p>'Look heah, Miss Cayley,' a voice broke in; 'I'm in luck at
last! I've been waiting, oh, evah so long, for this
opportunity.'</p>
<p>I turned and faced him. 'Have you, indeed?' I answered. 'Well, I
have <i>not</i>, Lord Southminster.'</p>
<p>I tried to rise, but he motioned me back to my chair. There were
ladies on deck, and to avoid being noticed I sank into my seat
again.</p>
<p>'I want to speak to you,' he went on, in a voice that (for him)
was almost impressive. 'Half a mo, Miss Cayley. I want to
say&mdash;this last night&mdash;you misunderstand me.'</p>
<p>'On the contrary,' I answered, 'the trouble is&mdash;that I
understand you perfectly.'</p>
<p>'No, yah don't. Look heah.' He bent forward quite<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
romantically. 'I'm going to be perfectly frank. Of course yah know
that when I came on board this ship I came&mdash;to checkmate
yah.'</p>
<p>'Of course,' I replied. 'Why else should you and Higginson have
bothered to come here?'</p>
<p>He rubbed his hands together. 'That's just it. You're always
clevah. You hit it first shot. But there's wheah the point comes
in. At first, I only thought of how we could circumvent yah. I
treated yah as the enemy. Now, it's all the othah way. Miss Cayley,
you're the cleverest woman I evah met in this world; you extort my
admiration.'</p>
<p>I could not repress a smile. I didn't know how it was, but I
could see I possessed some mysterious attraction for the Ashurst
family. I was fatal to Ashursts. Lady Georgina, Harold Tillington,
the Honourable Marmaduke, Lord Southminster&mdash;different types
as they were, all succumbed without one blow to me.</p>
<p>'You flatter me,' I answered, coldly.</p>
<p>'No, I don't,' he cried, flashing his cuffs and gazing
affectionately at his sleeve-links. ''Pon my soul, I assuah yah, I
mean it. I can't tell you how much I admiah yah. I admiah your
intellect. Every day I have seen yah, I feel it moah and moah. Why,
you're the only person who has evah out-flanked my fellah,
Higginson. As a rule I don't think much of women. I've been through
several London seasons, and lots of 'em have tried their level best
to catch me; the cleverest mammas have been aftah me for their
Ethels. But I wasn't so easily caught: I dodged the Ethels. With
you, it's different. I feel'&mdash;he paused&mdash;'you're a woman
a fellah might be really proud of.'</p>
<p>'You are too kind,' I answered, in my refrigerator
voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg
220]</a></span></p>
<p>'Well, will you take me?' he asked, trying to seize my hand.
'Miss Cayley, if you will, you will make me unspeakably happy.'</p>
<p>It was a great effort&mdash;for him&mdash;and I was sorry to
crush it. 'I regret,' I said, 'that I am compelled to deny you
unspeakable happiness.'</p>

title=""> <span class="caption">TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, YOU&#39;RE
STAKING YOUR MONEY ON THE WRONG FELLAH.</span></div>
<p>'Oh, but you don't catch on. You mistake. Let me explain. You're
backing the othah man. Now, I happen<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> to know about that:
and I assuah you, it's an error. Take my word for it, you're
staking your money on the wrong fellah.'</p>
<p>'I do not understand you,' I replied, drawing away from his
approach. 'And what is more, I may add, you could never understand
me.'</p>
<p>'Yaas, but I do. I understand perfectly. I can see where you go
wrong. You drew up Marmy's will; and you think Marmy has left all
he's worth to Harold Tillington; so you're putting every penny
you've got on Harold. Well, that's mere moonshine. Harold may think
it's all right; but it's not all right. There's many a slip 'twixt
the cup and the Probate Court. Listen heah, Miss Cayley: Higginson
and I are a jolly sight sharpah than your friend Harold. Harold's
what they call a clevah fellah in society, and I'm what they call a
fool; but I know bettah than Harold which side of my bread's
buttahed.'</p>
<p>'I don't doubt it,' I answered.</p>
<p>'Well, I have managed this business. I don't mind telling you
now, I had a telegram from Marmy's valet when we touched at Aden;
and poor old Marmy's sinking. Habakkuk's been too much for him.
Sixteen stone going under. Why am I not with him? yah may ask.
Because, when a man of Marmy's temperament is dying, it's safah to
be away from him. There's plenty of time for Marmy to altah his
will yet&mdash;and there are othah contingencies. Still, Harold's
quite out of it. You take my word for it; if you back Harold, you
back a man who's not going to get anything; while if you back me,
you back the winnah, with a coronet into the bargain.' And he
smiled fatuously.</p>
<p>I looked at him with a look that would have made a wiser man
wince. But it fell flat on Lord Southminster. 'Do you know why I do
not rise and go down to my cabin<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> at once?' I said,
slowly. 'Because, if I did, somebody as I passed might see my
burning cheeks&mdash;cheeks flushed with shame at your insulting
proposal&mdash;and might guess that you had asked me, and that I
had refused you. And I should shrink from the disgrace of anyone's
knowing that you had put such a humiliation upon me. You have been
frank with me&mdash;after your kind, Lord Southminster; frank with
the frankness of a low and purely commercial nature. I will be
frank with you in turn. You are right in supposing that I love
Harold Tillington&mdash;a man whose name I hate to mention in your
presence. But you are wrong in supposing that the disposition of
Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst's money has or can have anything to do with
the feelings I entertain towards him. I would marry him all the
sooner if he were poor and penniless. You cannot <i>understand</i>
that state of mind, of course: but you must be content to
<i>accept</i> it. And I would not marry <i>you</i> if there were no
other man left in the world to marry. I should as soon think of
marrying a lump of dough.' I faced him all crimson. 'Is <i>that</i>
plain enough? Do you see now that I really mean it?'</p>
<p>He gazed at me with a curious look, and twirled what he
considered his moustache once more, quite airily. The man was
imperturbable&mdash;a pachydermatous imbecile. 'You're all wrong,
yah know,' he said, after a long pause, during which he had
regarded me through his eye-glass as if I were a specimen of some
rare new species. 'You're all wrong, and yah won't believe me. But
I tell yah, I know what I'm talking about. You think it's quite
safe about Marmy's money&mdash;that he's left it to Harold, because
you drew the will up. I assuah you that will's not worth the paper
it's written on. You fancy Harold's a hot favourite: he's a rank
outsidah. I give you a chance, and you won't<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> take
it. I want yah because you're a remarkable woman. Most of the
Ethels cry when they're trying to make a fellah propose to 'em; and
I don't like 'em damp: but <i>you</i> have some go about yah. You
insist upon backing the wrong man. But you'll find your mistake out
yet.' A bright idea struck him. 'I say&mdash;why don't you hedge?
Leave it open till Marmy's gone, and then marry the winnah?'</p>
<p>It was hopeless trying to make this clod understand. His brain
was not built with the right cells for understanding me. 'Lord
Southminster,' I said, turning upon him and clasping my hands, 'I
will not go away while you stop here. But you have some spark
enough of a gentleman in your composition, I hope, not to inflict
your company any longer upon a woman who does not desire it. I ask
you to leave me here alone. When you have gone, and I have had time
to recover from your degrading offer, I may perhaps feel able to go
down to my cabin.'</p>
<p>He stared at me with open blue eyes&mdash;those watery blue
eyes. 'Oh, just as you like,' he answered. 'I wanted to do you a
good turn, because you're the only woman I evah really
admiahed&mdash;to say admiah, don't you know; not trotted round
like the Ethels: but you won't allow me. I'll go if you wish it;
though I tell you again, you're backing the wrong man, and soonah
or latah you'll discover it. I don't mind laying you six to four
against him. Howevah, I'll do one thing for yah: I'll leave this
offah always open. I'm not likely to marry any othah
woman&mdash;not good enough, is it?&mdash;and if evah you find out
you're mistaken about Harold Tillington, remembah, honour bright, I
shall be ready at any time to renew my offah.'</p>
<p>By this time I was at boiling-point. I could not find words to
answer him. I waved him away angrily with one hand. He raised his
hat with quite a jaunty air and strolled<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> off
forward, puffing his cigarette. I don't think he even knew the
disgust with which he inspired me.</p>
<p>I sat some hours with the cool air playing about my burning
cheeks before I mustered up courage to rise and go down below
again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX</h2>
<h3>THE ADVENTURES OF THE MAGNIFICENT MAHARAJAH</h3>
<p>Our arrival at Bombay was a triumphal entry. We were received
like royalty. Indeed, to tell you the truth, Elsie and I were
beginning to get just a leetle bit spoiled. It struck us now that
our casual connection with the Ashurst family in its various
branches had succeeded in saddling us, like the Lady of Burleigh,
'with the burden of an honour unto which we were not born.' We were
everywhere treated as persons of importance; and, oh dear, by dint
of such treatment we began to feel at last almost as if we had been
raised in the purple. I felt that when we got back to England we
should turn up our noses at plain bread and butter.</p>
<p>Yes, life has been kind to me. Have your researches into English
literature ever chanced to lead you into reading Horace Walpole, I
wonder? That polite trifler is fond of a word which he coined
himself&mdash;'Serendipity.' It derives from the name of a certain
happy Indian Prince Serendip, whom he unearthed (or invented) in
some obscure Oriental story; a prince for whom the fairies or the
genii always managed to make everything pleasant. It implies the
faculty, which a few of us possess, of finding whatever we want
turn up accidentally at the exact right moment. Well, I believe I
must have been born with serendipity in<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> my
mouth, in place of the proverbial silver spoon, for wherever I go,
all things seem to come out exactly right for me.</p>
<p>The <i>Jumna</i>, for example, had hardly heaved to in Bombay
Harbour when we noticed on the quay a very distinguished-looking
Oriental potentate, in a large, white turban with a particularly
big diamond stuck ostentatiously in its front. He stalked on board
with a martial air, as soon as we stopped, and made inquiries from
our captain after someone he expected. The captain received him
with that odd mixture of respect for rank and wealth, combined with
true British contempt for the inferior black man, which is
universal among his class in their dealings with native Indian
nobility. The Oriental potentate, however, who was accompanied by a
gorgeous suite like that of the Wise Men in Italian pictures,
seemed satisfied with his information, and moved over with his
stately glide in our direction. Elsie and I were standing near the
gangway among our rugs and bundles, in the hopeless helplessness of
disembarkation. He approached us respectfully, and, bowing with
extended hands and a deferential air, asked, in excellent English,
'May I venture to inquire which of you two ladies is Miss Lois
Cayley?'</p>
<p>'<i>I</i> am,' I replied, my breath taken away by this
unexpected greeting. 'May I venture to inquire in return how you
came to know I was arriving by this steamer?'</p>

<span class="caption">I AM THE MAHARAJAH OF
MOOZUFFERNUGGAR.</span></div>
<p>He held out his hand, with a courteous inclination. 'I am the
Maharajah of Moozuffernuggar,' he answered in an impressive tone,
as if everybody knew of the Maharajah of Moozuffernuggar as
familiarly as they knew of the Duke of Cambridge. 'Moozuffernuggar
in Rajputana&mdash;<i>not</i> the one in the Doab. You must have
heard my name from Mr. Harold Tillington.'<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>
<p>I had not; but I dissembled, so as to salve his pride. 'Mr.
Tillington's friends are <i>our</i> friends,' I answered,
sententiously.</p>
<p>'And Mr. Tillington's friends are <i>my</i> friends,' the
Maharajah retorted, with a low bow to Elsie. 'This is no doubt,
Miss Petheridge. I have heard of your expected arrival, as you will
guess, from Tillington. He and I were at Oxford together; I am a
Merton man. It was Tillington who first taught me all I know of
cricket. He took me to stop at his father's place in Dumfriesshire.
I owe much to his friendship; and when he wrote me that friends of
his were arriving by the <i>Jumna</i>, why, I made haste to run
down to Bombay to greet them.'</p>
<p>The episode was one of those topsy-turvy mixtures of<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> all
places and ages which only this jumbled century of ours has
witnessed; it impressed me deeply. Here was this Indian prince, a
feudal Rajput chief, living practically among his vassals in the
Middle Ages when at home in India; yet he said 'I am a Merton man,'
as Harold himself might have said it; and he talked about cricket
as naturally as Lord Southminster talked about the noble quadruped.
The oddest part of it all was, we alone felt the incongruity; to
the Maharajah, the change from Moozuffernuggar to Oxford and from
Oxford back again to Moozuffernuggar seemed perfectly natural. They
were but two alternative phases in a modern Indian gentleman's
education and experience.</p>
<p>Still, what were we to do with him? If Harold had presented me
with a white elephant I could hardly have been more embarrassed
than I was at the apparition of this urbane and magnificent Hindoo
prince. He was young; he was handsome; he was slim, for a rajah; he
wore European costume, save for the huge white turban with its
obtrusive diamond; and he spoke English much better than a great
many Englishmen. Yet what place could he fill in my life and
Elsie's? For once, I felt almost angry with Harold. Why couldn't he
have allowed us to go quietly through India, two simple unofficial
journalistic pilgrims, in our native obscurity?</p>
<p>His Highness of Moozuffernuggar, however, had his own views on
this question. With a courteous wave of one dusky hand, he motioned
us gracefully into somebody else's deck chairs, and then sat down
on another beside us, while the gorgeous suite stood by in
respectful silence&mdash;unctuous gentlemen in pink-and-gold
brocade&mdash;forming a court all round us. Elsie and I,
unaccustomed to be so observed, grew conscious of our hands, our
skirts, our postures. But the Maharajah posed himself with perfect
unconcern, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id=
"Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> one well used to the fierce light of
royalty. 'I have come,' he said, with simple dignity, 'to
superintend the preparations for your reception.'</p>
<p>'Gracious heavens!' I exclaimed. 'Our reception, Maharajah? I
think you misunderstand. We are two ordinary English ladies of the
proletariat, accustomed to the level plain of professional society.
We expect no reception.'</p>
<p>He bowed again, with stately Eastern deference. 'Friends of
Tillington's,' he said, shortly, 'are persons of distinction.
Besides, I have heard of you from Lady Georgina Fawley.'</p>
<p>'Lady Georgina is too good,' I answered, though inwardly I raged
against her. Why couldn't she leave us alone, to feed in peace on
dak-bungalow chicken, instead of sending this regal-mannered
heathen to bother us?</p>
<p>'So I have come down to Bombay to make sure that you are met in
the style that befits your importance in society,' he went on,
waving his suite away with one careless hand, for he saw it fussed
us. 'I mentioned you to His Honour the Acting-Governor, who had not
heard you were coming. His Honour's aide-de-camp will follow
shortly with an invitation to Government House while you remain in
Bombay&mdash;which will not be many days, I don't doubt, for there
is nothing in this city of plague to stop for. Later on, during
your progress up country, I do myself the honour to hope that you
will stay as my guests for as long as you choose at
Moozuffernuggar.'</p>
<p>My first impulse was to answer: 'Impossible, Maharajah; we
couldn't dream of accepting your kind invitation.' But on second
thoughts, I remembered my duty to my proprietor. Journalism first:
inclination afterwards! My letter from Egypt on the rescue of the
Englishwoman who escaped from Khartoum had brought me great
<i>&eacute;clat</i> as a special correspondent, and the <i>Daily
Telephone</i> now billed my name<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> in big letters on its
placards, so Mr. Elworthy wrote me. Here was another noble chance;
must I not strive to rise to it? Two English ladies at a native
court in Rajputana! that ought to afford scope for some rattling
journalism!</p>
<p>'It is extremely kind of you,' I said, hesitating, 'and it would
give us great pleasure, were it feasible, to accept your friendly
offer. But&mdash;English ideas, you know, prince! Two unprotected
women! I hardly see how we could come alone to Moozuffernuggar,
unchaperoned.'</p>
<p>The Maharajah's face lighted up; he was evidently flattered that
we should even thus dubiously entertain his proposal. 'Oh, I've
thought about that, too,' he answered, growing more colloquial in
tone. 'I've been some days in Bombay, making inquiries and
preparations. You see, you had not informed the authorities of your
intended visit, so that you were travelling
<i>incognito</i>&mdash;or should it be <i>incognita</i>?&mdash;and
if Tillington hadn't written to let me know your movements, you
might have arrived at this port without anybody's knowing it, and
have been compelled to take refuge in an hotel on landing.' He
spoke as if we had been accustomed all our lives long to be
received with red cloth by the Mayor and Corporation, and presented
with illuminated addresses and the freedom of the city in a gold
snuff-box. 'But I have seen to all that. The Acting-Governor's
aide-de-camp will be down before long, and I have arranged that if
you consent a little later to honour my humble roof in Rajputana
with your august presence, Major Balmossie and his wife will
accompany you and chaperon you. I have lived in England: of course
I understand that two English ladies of your rank and position
cannot travel alone&mdash;as if you were Americans. But Mrs.
Balmossie is a nice little soul, of unblemished
character'&mdash;that sweet touch charmed me&mdash;'received at
Government House'&mdash;he had learned the<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
respect due to Mrs. Grundy&mdash;'so that if you will accept my
invitation, you may rest assured that everything will be done with
the utmost regard to the&mdash;the unaccountable prejudices of
Europeans.'</p>

<span class="caption">WHO&#39;S YOUR BLACK FRIEND?</span></div>
<p>His thoughtfulness took me aback. I thanked him warmly. He
unbent at my thanks. 'And I am obliged to you in return,' he said.
'It gives me real pleasure to be able, through you, to repay Harold
Tillington part of the debt I owe him. He was so good to me at
Oxford. Miss Cayley, you are new to India, and therefore&mdash;as
yet&mdash;no doubt unprejudiced. You treat a native gentleman, I
see, like a human being. I hope you will not stop long enough in
our country to get over that stage&mdash;as happens to most of your
countrymen and countrywomen. In England, a man like myself is an
Indian prince; in India, to ninety-nine out of a hundred Europeans,
he is just "a damned nigger."'</p>
<p>I smiled sympathetically. 'I think,' I said, venturing under
these circumstances on a harmless little swear-word&mdash;of
course, in quotation marks&mdash;'you may trust me never to reach
"damn-nigger" point.'</p>
<p>'So I believe,' he answered, 'if you are a friend of Harold
Tillington's. Ebony or ivory, he never forgot we were two men
together.'</p>
<p>Five minutes later, when the Maharajah had gone to inquire about
our luggage, Lord Southminster strolled up. 'Oh, I say, Miss
Cayley,' he burst out, 'I'm off now; ta-ta: but remembah, that
offah's always open. By the way, who's your black friend? I
couldn't help laughing at the airs the fellah gave himself. To see
a niggah sitting theah, with his suite all round him, waving his
hands and sunning his rings, and behaving for all the world as if
he were a gentleman; it's reahly too ridiculous. Harold Tillington
picked up with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id=
"Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> a fellah like that at
Oxford&mdash;doosid good cricketer too; wondah if this is the same
one?'</p>
<p>'Good-bye, Lord Southminster,' I said, quietly, with a stiff
little bow. 'Remember, on your side, that your "offer" was rejected
once for all last night. Yes, the Indian prince <i>is</i> Harold
Tillington's friend, the Maharajah of Moozuffernuggar&mdash;whose
ancestors were princes while ours were<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
dressed in woad and oak-leaves. But you were right about one thing;
<i>he</i> behaves&mdash;like a gentleman.'</p>
<p>'Oh, I say,' the pea-green young man ejaculated, drawing back;
'that's anothah in the eye for me. You're a good 'un at facers. You
gave me one for a welcome, and you give me one now for a parting
shot. Nevah mind though, I can wait; you're backing the wrong
fellah&mdash;but you're not the Ethels, and you're well worth
waiting for.' He waved his hand. 'So-long! See yah again in
London.'</p>
<p>And he retired, with that fatuous smile still absorbing his
features.</p>
<hr style='width: 25%;'>
<p>Our three days in Bombay were uneventful; we merely waited to
get rid of the roll of the ship, which continued to haunt us for
hours after we landed&mdash;the floor of our bedrooms having
acquired an ugly trick of rising in long undulations, as if Bombay
were suffering from chronic earthquake. We made the acquaintance of
His Honour the Acting Governor, and His Honour's consort. We were
also introduced to Mrs. Balmossie, the lady who was to chaperon us
to Moozuffernuggar. Her husband was a soldierly Scotchman from
Forfarshire, but she herself was English&mdash;a flighty little
body with a perpetual giggle. She giggled so much over the idea of
the Maharajah's inviting us to his palace that I wondered why on
earth she accepted his invitation. At this she seemed surprised.
'Why, it's one of the jolliest places in Rajputana,' she answered,
with a bland Simla smile; '<i>so</i> picturesque&mdash;he, he,
he&mdash;and <i>so</i> delightful. Simpkin flows like water&mdash;
Simpkin's baboo English for champagne, you know&mdash;he, he, he;
and though of course the Maharajah's only a native like the rest of
them&mdash;he, he, he&mdash;still, he's been educated at Oxford,
and has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg
234]</a></span> mixed with Europeans, and he knows how to make
one&mdash;he, he, he&mdash;well, thoroughly comfortable.'</p>
<p>'But what shall we eat?' I asked. 'Rice, ghee, and
chupatties?'</p>
<p>'Oh dear no&mdash;he, he, he&mdash;Europe food, every bit of it.
Foie gras, and York ham, and wine <i>ad lib</i>. His hospitality's
massive. If it weren't for that, of course, one wouldn't dream of
going there. But Archie hopes some day to be made Resident, don't
you know; and it will do him no harm&mdash;he, he, he&mdash;with
the Foreign Office, to have cultivated friendly relations
beforehand with His Highness of Moozuffernuggar. These
natives&mdash;he, he, he&mdash;so absurdly sensitive!'</p>
<p>For myself, the Maharajah interested me, and I rather liked him.
Besides, he was Harold's friend, and that was in itself sufficient
recommendation. So I determined to push straight into the heart of
native India first, and only afterwards to do the regulation
tourist round of Agra and Delhi, the Taj and the mosques, Benares
and Allahabad, leaving the English and Calcutta for the tail-end of
my journey. It was better journalism; as I thought that thought, I
began to fear that Mr. Elworthy was right after all, and that I was
a born journalist.</p>
<p>On the day fixed for our leaving Bombay, whom should I meet but
Lord Southminster&mdash;with the Maharajah&mdash;at the railway
station!</p>
<p>He lounged up to me with that eternal smile still vaguely
pervading his empty features. 'Well, we shall have a jolly party, I
gathah,' he said. 'They tell me this niggah is famous for his
tigahs.'</p>
<p>I gazed at him, positively taken aback. 'You don't mean to tell
me,' I cried, 'you actually propose to accept the Maharajah's
hospitality?'</p>
<p>His smile absorbed him. 'Yaas,' he answered twirling<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> his
yellow moustache, and gazing across at the unconscious prince, who
was engaged in overlooking the arrangements for our saloon
carriage. 'The black fellah discovahed I was a cousin of Harold's,
so he came to call upon me at the club, of which some Johnnies heah
made me an honorary membah. He's offahed me the run of his place
while I'm in Indiah, and, of course, I've accepted. Eccentric sort
of chap; can't make him out myself: says anyone connected with
Harold Tillington is always deah to him. Rum start, isn't it?'</p>
<p>'He is a mere Oriental,' I answered, 'unused to the ways of
civilised life. He cherishes the superannuated virtue of
gratitude.'</p>
<p>'Yaas; no doubt&mdash;so I'm coming along with you.'</p>
<p>I drew back, horrified. 'Now? While I am there? After what I
told you last week on the steamer?'</p>
<p>'Oh, that's all right. I bear yah no malice. If I want any fun,
of course I must go while <i>you're</i> at Moozuffernuggar.'</p>
<p>'Why so?'</p>
<p>'Yah see, this black boundah means to get up some big things at
his place in your honah; and one naturally goes to stop with anyone
who has big things to offah. Hang it all, what does it mattah who a
fellah is if he can give yah good shooting? It's shooting, don't
yah know, that keeps society in England togethah!'</p>
<p>'And therefore you propose to stop in the same house with me!' I
exclaimed, 'in spite of what I have told you! Well, Lord
Southminster, I should have thought there were limits which even
<i>your</i> taste&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>He cut me short with an inane grin. 'There you make your
blooming little erraw,' he answered, airily. 'I told yah, I keep my
offah still open; and, hang it all, I don't mean to lose sight of
yah in a hurry. Some other fellah might come along and pick you up
when I wasn't looking; and I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> want to miss yah. In
point of fact, I don't mind telling yah, I back myself still for a
couple of thou' soonah or latah to marry yah. It's dogged as does
it; faint heart, they say, nevah won fair lady!'</p>
<p>If it had not been that I could not bear to disappoint my Indian
prince, I think, when I heard this, I should have turned back then
and there at the station.</p>
<p>The journey up country was uneventful, but dusty. The Mofussil
appears to consist mainly of dust; indeed, I can now recall nothing
of it but one pervading white cloud, which has blotted from my
memory all its other components. The dust clung to my hair after
many washings, and was never really beaten out of my travelling
clothes; I believe part of it thus went round the world with me to
England. When at last we reached Moozuffernuggar, after two days'
and a night's hard travelling, we were met by a crowd of local
grandees, who looked as if they had spent the greater part of their
lives in brushing back their whiskers, and we drove up at once, in
European carriages, to the Maharajah's palace. The look of it
astonished me. It was a strange and rambling old Hindoo hill-fort,
high perched on a scarped crag, like Edinburgh Castle, and
accessible only on one side, up a gigantic staircase, guarded on
either hand by huge sculptured elephants cut in the living
sandstone. Below clustered the town, an intricate mass of tangled
alleys. I had never seen anything so picturesque or so dirty in my
life; as for Elsie, she was divided between admiration for its
beauty and terror at the big-whiskered and white-turbaned
attendants.</p>
<p>'What sort of rooms shall we have?' I whispered to our moral
guarantee, Mrs. Balmossie.</p>
<p>'Oh, beautiful, dear,' the little lady smirked back. 'Furnished
throughout&mdash;he, he, he&mdash;by Liberty. The<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
Maharajah wants to do honour to his European guests&mdash;he, he,
he&mdash;he fancies, poor man, he's quite European. That's what
comes of sending these creatures to Oxford! So he's had suites of
rooms furnished for any white visitors who may chance to come his
way. Ridiculous, isn't it? <i>And</i> champagne&mdash;oh, gallons
of it! He's quite proud of his rooms, he, he, he&mdash;he's always
asking people to come and occupy them; he thinks he's done them up
in the best style of decoration.'</p>
<p>He had reason, for they were as tasteful as they were dainty and
comfortable. And I could not for the life of me make out why his
hospitable inclination should be voted 'ridiculous.' But Mrs.
Balmossie appeared to find all natives alike a huge joke together.
She never even spoke of them without a condescending smile of
distant compassion. Indeed, most Anglo-Indians seem first to do
their best to Anglicise the Hindoo, and then to laugh at him for
aping the Englishman.</p>
<p>After we had been three days at the palace and had spent hours
in the wonderful temples and ruins, the Maharajah announced with
considerable pride at breakfast one morning that he had got up a
tiger-hunt in our special honour.</p>
<p>Lord Southminster rubbed his hands.</p>
<p>'Ha, that's right, Maharaj,' he said, briskly. 'I do love big
game. To tell yah the truth, old man, that's just what I came heah
for.'</p>
<p>'You do me too much honour,' the Hindoo answered, with quiet
sarcasm. 'My town and palace may have little to offer that is worth
your attention; but I am glad that my big game, at least, has been
lucky enough to attract you.'</p>
<p>The remark was thrown away on the pea-green young man. He had
described his host to me as 'a black boundah.' Out of his own mouth
I condemned him&mdash;he supplied the<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> very word&mdash;he was
himself nothing more than a born bounder.</p>

"A TIGER-HUNT IS NOT A THING TO BE GOT UP LIGHTLY." title="">
<span class="caption">A TIGER-HUNT IS NOT A THING TO BE GOT UP
LIGHTLY.</span></div>
<p>During the next few days, the preparations for the tiger-hunt
occupied all the Maharajah's energies. 'You know, Miss Cayley,' he
said to me, as we stood upon the big stairs, looking down on the
Hindoo city, 'a tiger-hunt is not a thing to be got up lightly. Our
people themselves don't like killing a tiger. They reverence it too
much. They're afraid its spirit might haunt them afterwards and
bring them bad luck. That's one of our superstitions.'</p>
<p>'You do not share it yourself, then?' I asked.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>
<p>He drew himself up and opened his palms, with a twinkling of
pendant emeralds. 'I am royal,' he answered, with na&iuml;ve
dignity, 'and the tiger is a royal beast. Kings know the ways of
kings. If a king kills what is kingly, it owes him no grudge for
it. But if a common man or a low caste man were to kill a
tiger&mdash;who can say what might happen?'</p>
<p>I saw he was not himself quite free from the superstition.</p>
<p>'Our peasants,' he went on, fixing me with his great black eyes,
'won't even mention the tiger by name, for fear of offending him:
they believe him to be the dwelling-place of a powerful spirit. If
they wish to speak of him, they say, "the great beast," or "my
lord, the striped one." Some think the spirit is immortal except at
the hands of a king. But they have no objection to see him
destroyed by others. They will even point out his whereabouts, and
rejoice over his death; for it relieves the village of a serious
enemy, and they believe the spirit will only haunt the huts of
those who actually kill him.'</p>
<p>'Then you know where each tiger lives?' I asked.</p>
<p>'As well as your gamekeepers in England know which covert may be
drawn for foxes. Yes; 'tis a royal sport, and we keep it for
Maharajahs. I myself never hunt a tiger till some European visitor
of distinction comes to Moozuffernuggar, that I may show him good
sport. This tiger we shall hunt to-morrow, for example, he is a bad
old hand. He has carried off the buffaloes of my villagers over
yonder for years and years, and of late he has also become a
man-eater. He once ate a whole family at a meal&mdash;a man, his
wife, and his three children. The people at Janwargurh have been
pestering me for weeks to come and shoot him; and each week he has
eaten somebody&mdash;a child or a woman; the last was
yesterday&mdash;but I waited till you came, because<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> I
thought it would be something to show you that you would not be
likely to see elsewhere.'</p>
<p>'And you let the poor people go on being eaten, that we might
enjoy this sport!' I cried.</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and opened his palms. 'They were
villagers, you know&mdash;ryots: mere tillers of the
soil&mdash;poor naked peasants. I have thousands of them to spare.
If a tiger eats ten of them, they only say, "It was written upon
their foreheads." One woman more or less&mdash;who would notice her
at Moozuffernuggar?'</p>
<p>Then I perceived that the Maharajah was a gentleman, but still a
barbarian.</p>
<p>The eventful morning arrived at last, and we started, all agog,
for the jungle where the tiger was known to live. Elsie excused
herself. She remarked to me the night before, as I brushed her back
hair for her, that she had 'half a mind' not to go. 'My dear,' I
answered, giving the brush a good dash, 'for a higher
mathematician, that phrase lacks accuracy. If you were to say
"seven-eighths of a mind" it would be nearer the mark. In point of
fact, if you ask my opinion, your inclination to go is a vanishing
quantity.'</p>
<p>She admitted the impeachment with an accusing blush. 'You're
quite right, Brownie; to tell you the truth, I'm afraid of it.'</p>
<p>'So am I, dear; horribly afraid. Between ourselves, I'm in a
deadly funk of it. But "the brave man is not he that feels no
fear"; and I believe the same principle applies almost equally to
the brave woman. I mean "that fear to subdue" as far as I am able.
The Maharajah says I shall be the first girl who has ever gone
tiger-hunting. I'm frightened out of my life. I never held a gun in
my born days before. But, Elsie, recollect, this is <i>splendid</i>
journalism! I intend to go through with it.'<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>
<p>'You offer yourself on the altar, Brownie.'</p>
<p>'I do, dear; I propose to die in the cause. I expect my
proprietor to carve on my tomb, "Sacred to the memory of the martyr
of journalism. She was killed, in the act of taking shorthand
notes, by a Bengal tiger."'</p>
<p>We started at early dawn, a motley mixture. My short bicycling
skirt did beautifully for tiger-hunting. There was a vast company
of native swells, nawabs and ranas, in gorgeous costumes, whose
precise names and titles I do not pretend to remember; there were
also Major Balmossie, Lord Southminster, the Maharajah, and
myself&mdash;all mounted on gaily-caparisoned elephants. We had
likewise, on foot, a miserable crowd of wretched beaters, with
dirty white loin-cloths. We were all very brave, of
course&mdash;demonstratively brave&mdash;and we talked a great deal
at the start about the exhilaration given by 'the spice of danger.'
But it somehow struck me that the poor beaters on foot had the
majority of the danger and extremely little of the exhilaration.
Each of us great folk was mounted on his own elephant, which
carried a light basket-work howdah in two compartments: the front
one intended for the noble sportsman, the back one for a servant
with extra guns and ammunition. I pretended to like it, but I fear
I trembled visibly. Our mahouts sat on the elephants' necks, each
armed with a pointed goad, to whose admonition the huge beasts
answered like clock-work. A born journalist always pretends to know
everything before hand, so I speak carelessly of the 'mahout,' as
if he were a familiar acquaintance. But I don't mind telling you
aside, in confidence, that I had only just learnt the word that
morning.</p>
<p>The Maharajah protested at first against my taking part in the
actual hunt, but I think his protest was merely formal. In his
heart of hearts I believe he was proud that the first lady
tiger-hunter should have joined his party.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>
<p>Dusty and shadeless, the road from Moozuffernuggar fares
straight across the plain towards the crumbling mountains. Behind,
in the heat mist, the castle and palace on their steeply-scarped
crag, with the squalid town that clustered at their feet, reminded
me once more most strangely of Edinburgh, where I used to spend my
vacations from Girton. But the pitiless sun differed greatly from
the gray haar of the northern metropolis. It warmed into intense
white the little temples of the wayside, and beat on our heads with
tropical garishness.</p>
<p>I am bound to admit also that tiger-hunting is not quite all it
is cracked up to be. In my fancy I had pictured the gallant and
bloodthirsty beast rushing out upon us full pelt from some
grass-grown nullah at the first sniff of our presence, and fiercely
attacking both men and elephants. Instead of that, I will confess
the whole truth: frightened as at least one of us was of the tiger,
the tiger was still more desperately frightened of his human
assailants. I could see clearly that, so far from rushing out of
his own accord to attack us, his one desire was to be let alone. He
was horribly afraid; he skulked in the jungle like a wary old fox
in a trusty spinney. There was no nullah (whatever a nullah may
be), there was only a waste of dusty cane-brake. We encircled the
tall grass patch where he lurked, forming a big round with a
ring-fence of elephants. The beaters on foot, advancing, half
naked, with a caution with which I could fully sympathise,
endeavoured by loud shouts and gesticulations to rouse the royal
beast to a sense of his position. Not a bit of it: the royal beast
declined to be drawn; he preferred retirement. The Maharajah, whose
elephant was stationed next to mine, even apologised for the
resolute cowardice with which he clung to his ignoble
lurking-place.</p>
<p>The beaters drew in: the elephants, raising their
trunks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg
243]</a></span> in air and sniffing suspicion, moved slowly inward.
We had girt him round now with a perfect ring, through which he
could not possibly break without attacking somebody. The Maharajah
kept a fixed eye on my personal safety. But still the royal animal
crouched and skulked, and still the black beaters shrieked, howled,
and gesticulated. At last, among the tall perpendicular lights and
shadows of the big grasses and bamboos, I seemed to see something
move&mdash;something striped like the stems, yet passing slowly,
slowly, slowly between them. It moved in a stealthy undulating
line. No one could believe till he saw it how the bright
flame-coloured bands of vivid orange-yellow on the monster's
flanks, and the interspersed black stripes, could fade away and
harmonise, in their native surroundings, with the lights and shades
of the upright jungle. It was a marvel of mimicry. 'Look there!' I
cried to the Maharajah, pointing one eager hand. 'What is that
thing there, moving?'</p>
<p>He stared where I pointed. 'By Jove,' he cried, raising his
rifle with a sportsman's quickness, 'you have spotted him first!
The tiger!'</p>
<p>The terrified beast stole slowly and cautiously through the tall
grasses, his lithe, silken side gliding in and out snakewise, and
only his fierce eyes burning bright with gleaming flashes between
the gloom of the jungle. Once I had seen him, I could follow with
ease his sinuous path among the tangled bamboos, a waving line of
beauty in perpetual motion. The Maharajah followed him too, with
his keen eyes, and pointed his rifle hastily. But, quick as he was,
Lord Southminster was before him. I had half expected to find the
pea-green young man turn coward at the last moment; but in that I
was mistaken: I will do him the justice to say, whatever else he
was, he was a born sportsman. The gleam of joy in his leaden eye
when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg
244]</a></span> caught sight of the tiger, the flush of excitement
on his pasty face, the eagerness of his alert attitude, were things
to see and remember. That moment almost ennobled him. In sight of
danger, the best instincts of the savage seemed to revive within
him. In civilised life he was a poor creature; face to face with a
wild beast he became a mighty shikari. Perhaps that was why he was
so fond of big-game shooting. He may have felt it raised him in the
scale of being.</p>
<p>He lifted his rifle and fired. He was a cool shot, and he
wounded the beast upon its left shoulder. I could see the great
crimson stream gush out all at once across the shapely sides,
staining the flame-coloured stripes and reddening the black
shadows. The tiger drew back, gave a low, fierce growl, and then
crouched among the jungle. I saw he was going to leap; he bent his
huge backbone into a strong downward curve, took in a deep breath,
and stood at bay, glaring at us. Which elephant would he attack?
That was what he was now debating. Next moment, with a frightful
R'-r'-r'-r', he had straightened out his muscles, and, like a bolt
from a bow, had launched his huge bulk forward.</p>
<p>I never saw his charge. I never knew he had leapt upon me. I
only felt my elephant rock from side to side like a ship in a
storm. He was trumpeting, shaking, roaring with rage and pain, for
the tiger was on his flanks, its claws buried deep in the skin of
his forehead. I could not keep my seat; I felt myself tossed about
in the frail howdah like a pill in a pill-box. The elephant, in a
death grapple, was trying to shake off his ghastly enemy. For a
minute or two, I was conscious of nothing save this swinging
movement. Then, opening my eyes for a second, I saw the tiger, in
all his terrible beauty, clinging to the elephant's head by the
claws of his fore paws, and struggling for a<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
foothold on its trunk with his mighty hind legs, in a wounded agony
of despair and vengeance. He would sell his life dear; he would
have one or other of us.</p>
<p>Lord Southminster raised his rifle again; but the Maharajah
shouted aloud in an angry voice: 'Don't fire! Don't fire! You will
kill the lady! You can't aim at him<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> like that. The beast
is rocking so that no one can say where a shot will take effect.
Down with your gun, sir, instantly!'</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 467px;"><a name="ILL_059" id=

height="500" alt="IT WENT OFF UNEXPECTEDLY." title=""> <span class=
"caption">IT WENT OFF UNEXPECTEDLY.</span></div>
<p>My mahout, unable to keep his seat with the rocking, now dropped
off his cushion among the scrub below. He could speak a few words
of English. 'Shoot, Mem Sahib, shoot!' he cried, flinging his hands
up. But I was tossed to and fro, from side to side, with my rifle
under my arm. It was impossible to aim. Yet in sheer terror I tried
to draw the trigger. I failed; but somehow I caught my rifle
against the side of my cage. Something snapped in it somewhere. It
went off unexpectedly, without my aiming or firing. I shut my eyes.
When I opened them again, I saw a swimming picture of the great
sullen beast, loosing his hold on the elephant. I saw his brindled
face; I saw his white tusks. But his gleaming pupils burned bright
no longer. His jaw was full towards me: I had shot him between the
eyes. He fell, slowly, with blood streaming from his nostrils, and
his tongue lolling out. His muscles relaxed; his huge limbs grew
limp. In a minute, he lay stretched at full length on the ground,
with his head on one side, a grand, terrible picture.</p>
<p>My mahout flung up his hands in wonder and amazement. 'My
father!' he cried aloud. 'Truly, the Mem Sahib is a great
shikari!'</p>
<p>The Maharajah stretched across to me. 'That was a wonderful
shot!' he exclaimed. 'I could never have believed a woman could
show such nerve and coolness.'</p>
<p>Nerve and coolness, indeed! I was trembling all over like an
Italian greyhound, every limb a jelly; and I had not even fired:
the rifle went off of itself without me. I am innocent of having
ever endangered the life of a haycock. But once more I dissembled.
'Yes, it <i>was</i> a difficult shot,'<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> I
said jauntily, as if I rather liked tiger-hunting. 'I didn't think
I'd hit him.' Still the effect of my speech was somewhat marred, I
fear, by the tears that in spite of me rolled down my cheek
silently.</p>
<p>''Pon honah, I nevah saw a finah piece of shooting in my life,'
Lord Southminster drawled out. Then he added aside, in an
undertone, 'Makes a fellow moah determined to annex her than
evah!'</p>
<p>I sat in my howdah, half dazed. I hardly heard what they were
saying. My heart danced like the elephant. Then it stood still
within me. I was only aware of a feeling of faintness. Luckily for
my reputation as a mighty sportswoman, however, I just managed to
keep up, and did not actually faint, as I was more than half
inclined to do.</p>
<p>Next followed the native p&aelig;an. The beaters crowded round
the fallen beast in a chorus of congratulation. Many of the
villagers also ran out, with prayers and ejaculations, to swell our
triumph. It was all like a dream. They hustled round me and
salaamed to me. A woman had shot him! Wonderful! A babel of voices
resounded in my ears. I was aware that pure accident had elevated
me into a heroine.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 299px;"><a name="ILL_060" id=

<span class="caption">I SAW HIM NOW THE ORIENTAL
DESPOT.</span></div>
<p>'Put the beast on a pad elephant,' the Maharajah called out.</p>
<p>The beaters tied ropes round his body and raised him with
difficulty.</p>
<p>The Maharajah's face grew stern. 'Where are the whiskers?' he
asked, fiercely, in his own tongue, which Major Balmossie
interpreted for me.</p>
<p>The beaters and the villagers, bowing low and expanding their
hands, made profuse expressions of ignorance and innocence. But the
fact was patent&mdash;the grand face had been mangled. While they
had crowded in a dense group<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> round the fallen
carcass, somebody had cut off the lips and whiskers and secreted
them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg
249]</a></span></p>
<p>'They have ruined the skin!' the Maharajah cried out in angry
tones. 'I intended it for the lady. I shall have them all searched,
and the man who has done this thing&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>He broke off, and looked around him. His silence was more
terrible by far than the fiercest threat. I saw him now the
Oriental despot. All the natives drew back, awe-struck.</p>
<p>'The voice of a king is the voice of a great god,' my mahout
murmured, in a solemn whisper. Then nobody else said anything.</p>
<p>'Why do they want the whiskers?' I asked, just to set things
straight again. 'They seem to have been in a precious hurry to take
them!'</p>
<p>The Maharajah's brow cleared. He turned to me once more with his
European manner. 'A tiger's body has wonderful power after his
death,' he answered. 'His fangs and his claws are very potent
charms. His heart gives courage. Whoever eats of it will never know
fear. His liver preserves against death and pestilence. But the
highest virtue of all exists in his whiskers. They are mighty
talismans. Chopped up in food, they act as a slow poison, which no
doctor can detect, no antidote guard against. They are also a
sovereign remedy against magic or the evil eye. And administered to
women, they make an irresistible philtre, a puissant love-potion.
They secure you the heart of whoever drinks them.'</p>
<p>'I'd give a couple of monkeys for those whiskahs,' Lord
Southminster murmured, half unnoticed.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;"><a name="ILL_061" id=

<span class="caption">IT&#39;S I WHO AM THE WINNAH.</span></div>
<p>We began to move again. 'We'll go on to where we know there is
another tiger,' the Maharajah said, lightly, as if tigers were
partridges. 'Miss Cayley, you will come with us?'</p>
<p>I rested on my laurels. (I was quivering still from head to
foot.) 'No, thank you, Maharajah,' as unconcernedly as<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> I
could; 'I've had quite enough sport for my first day's
tiger-hunting. I think I'll go back now, and write a newspaper
account of this little adventure.'</p>
<p>'You have had luck,' he put in. 'Not everyone kills a tiger his
first day out. This will make good reading.'</p>
<p>'I wouldn't have missed it for a hundred pounds,' I
answered.</p>
<p>'Then try another.'</p>
<p>'I wouldn't try another for a thousand,' I cried, fervently.
That evening, at the palace, I was the heroine of the day. They
toasted me in a bumper of Heidsieck's dry<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
monopole. The men made speeches. Everybody talked gushingly of my
splendid courage and my steadiness of hand. It was a brilliant
shot, under such difficult circumstances. For myself, I said
nothing. I pretended to look modest. I dared not confess the
truth&mdash;that I never fired at all. And from that day to this I
have never confessed it, till I write it down now in these
confiding memoirs.</p>
<p>One episode cast a gloom over my ill-deserved triumph. In the
course of the evening, a telegram arrived for the pea-green young
man by a white-turbaned messenger. He read it, and crumpled it up
carelessly in his hand. I looked inquiry. 'Yaas,' he answered,
nodding. 'You're quite right. It's that! Pooah old Marmy has gone,
aftah all! Ezekiel and Habakkuk have carried off his sixteen stone
at last! And I don't mind telling yah now&mdash;though it was a
neah thing&mdash;it's <i>I</i> who am the winnah!'<span class=

<h3>THE ADVENTURE OF THE CROSS-EYED Q.C.</h3>
<p>The 'cold weather,' as it is humorously called, was now drawing
to a close, and the young ladies in sailor hats and cambric
blouses, who flock to India each autumn for the annual
marriage-market, were beginning to resign themselves to a return to
England&mdash;unless, of course, they had succeeded in 'catching.'
So I realised that I must hurry on to Delhi and Agra, if I was not
to be intercepted by the intolerable summer.</p>
<p>When we started from Moozuffernuggar for Delhi and the East,
Lord Southminster was starting for Bombay and Europe. This
surprised me not a little, for he had confided to my unsympathetic
ear a few nights earlier, in the Maharajah's billiard-room, that he
was 'stony broke,' and must wait at Moozuffernuggar for lack of
funds 'till the oof-bird laid' at his banker's in England. His
conversation enlarged my vocabulary, at any rate.</p>
<p>'So you've managed to get away?' I exclaimed, as he dawdled up
to me at the hot and dusty station.</p>
<p>'Yaas,' he drawled, fixing his eye-glass, and lighting a
cigarette. 'I've&mdash;p'f&mdash;managed to get away. Maharaj seems
to have thought&mdash;p'f&mdash;it would be cheepah in the end to
pay me out than to keep me.'<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>
<p>'You don't mean to say he offered to lend you money?' I
cried.</p>
<p>'No; not exactly that: <i>I</i> offahed to borrow it.'</p>
<p>'From the man you call a nigger?'</p>
<p>His smile spread broader over his face than ever. 'Well, we
borrow from the Jews, yah know,' he said pleasantly, 'so why the
jooce shouldn't we borrow from the heathen also? Spoiling the
Egyptians, don't yah see?&mdash;the same as we used to read about
in the Scripchah when we were innocent kiddies. Like marriage,
quite. You borrow in haste&mdash;and repay at leisure.'</p>
<p>He strolled off and took his seat. I was glad to get rid of him
at the main line junction.</p>
<p>In accordance with my usual merciful custom, I spare you the
details of our visit to Agra, Muttra, Benares. At Calcutta, Elsie
left me. Her health was now quite restored, dear little soul&mdash;
I felt I had done that one good thing in life if no other&mdash;and
she could no longer withstand the higher mathematics, which were
beckoning her to London with invisible fingers. For myself, having
so far accomplished my original design of going round the world
with twopence in my pocket, I could not bear to draw back at half
the circuit; and Mr. Elworthy having willingly consented to my
return by Singapore and Yokohama, I set out alone on my homeward
journey.</p>

<p>Harold wrote me from London that all was going well. He had
found the will which I drew up at Florence in his uncle's
escritoire, and everything was left to him; but he trusted, in
spite of this untoward circumstance, long absence might have
altered my determination. 'Dear Lois,' he wrote, 'I <i>expect</i>
you to come back to England and marry me!'</p>
<p>I was brief, but categorical. Nothing, meanwhile, had altered my
resolve. I did not wish to be considered mercenary.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
While he was rich and honoured, I could never take him. If, some
day, fortune frowned&mdash;but, there&mdash;let us not forestall
the feet of calamity: let us await contingencies.</p>
<p>Still, I was heavy in heart. If only it had been otherwise! To
say the truth, I should be thrown away on a millionaire; but just
think what a splendid managing wife a girl like me would have made
for a penniless pauper!</p>
<p>At Yokohama, however, while I dawdled in curiosity shops, a
telegram from Harold startled me into seriousness. My chance at
last! I knew what it meant; that villain Higginson!</p>
<p>'Come home at once. I want your evidence to clear my character.
Southminster opposes the will as a forgery. He has a strong case;
the experts are with him.'</p>
<p>Forgery! That was clever. I never thought of that. I suspected
them of trying to forge a will of their own; but to upset the real
one&mdash;to throw the burden of<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> suspicion on Harold's
shoulders&mdash;how much subtler and craftier!</p>
<p>I saw at a glance it gave them every advantage. In the first
place, it put Harold virtually in the place of the accused, and
compelled him to defend instead of attacking&mdash;an attitude
which prejudices people against one from the outset. Then, again,
it implied positive criminality on his part, and so allowed Lord
Southminster to assume the air of injured innocence. The eldest son
of the eldest brother, unjustly set aside by the scheming
machinations of an unscrupulous cousin! Primogeniture, the
ingrained English love for keeping up the dignity of a noble
family, the prejudice in favour of the direct male line as against
the female&mdash;all were astutely utilised in Lord Southminster's
interest. But worst of all, it was <i>I</i> who had typewritten the
will&mdash;I, a friend of Harold's, a woman whom Lord Southminster
would doubtless try to exhibit as his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>. I saw
at once how much like conspiracy it looked: Harold and I had agreed
together to concoct a false document, and Harold had forged his
uncle's signature to it. Could a British jury doubt when a Lord
declared it?</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was just in time to catch the Canadian steamer
from Japan to Vancouver. But, oh, the endless breadth of that broad
Pacific! How time seemed to lag, as each day one rose in the
morning, in the midst of space; blue sky overhead; behind one, the
hard horizon; in front of one, the hard horizon; and nothing else
visible: then steamed on all day, to arrive at night,
where?&mdash;why, in the midst of space; starry sky overhead;
behind one, the dim horizon; in front of one, the dim horizon; and
nothing else visible. The Nile was child's play to it.</p>

height="500" alt="IT WAS ENDLESSLY WEARISOME." title="">
<span class="caption">IT WAS ENDLESSLY WEARISOME.</span></div>
<p>Day after day we steamed, and night after night were still where
we began&mdash;in the centre of the sea, no farther<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> from
our starting-point, no nearer to our goal, yet for ever steaming.
It was endlessly wearisome; who could say what might be happening
meanwhile in England?</p>
<p>At last, after months, as it seemed, of this slow torture, we
reached Vancouver. There, in the raw new town, a telegram awaited
me. 'Glad to hear you are coming. Make all haste. You may be just
in time to arrive for the trial.'</p>
<p>Just in time! I would not waste a moment. I caught the first
train on the Canadian Pacific, and travelled straight<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
through, day and night, to Montreal and Quebec, without one hour's
interval.</p>
<p>I cannot describe to you that journey across a continent I had
never before seen. It was endless and hopeless. I only know that we
crawled up the Rocky Mountains and the Selkirk Range, over
spider-like viaducts, with interminable effort, and that the
prairies were just the broad Pacific over again. They rolled on for
ever. But we did reach Quebec&mdash;in time we reached it; and we
caught by an hour the first liner to Liverpool.</p>
<p>At Prince's Landing-stage another telegram awaited me. 'Come on
at once. Case now proceeding. Harold is in court. We need your
evidence.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Georgina Fawley</span>.'</p>
<p>I might still be in time to vindicate Harold's character.</p>
<p>At Euston, to my surprise, I was met not only by my dear
cantankerous old lady, but also by my friend, the magnificent
Maharajah, dressed this time in a frock-coat and silk hat of Bond
Street glossiness.</p>
<p>'What has brought you to England?' I asked, astonished. 'The
Jubilee?'</p>
<p>He smiled, and showed his two fine rows of white teeth. 'That,
nominally. In reality, the cricket season (I play for Berks). But
most of all, to see dear Tillington safe through this trouble.'</p>
<p>'He's a brick!' Lady Georgina cried with enthusiasm. 'A regular
brick, my dear Lois! His carriage is waiting outside to take you up
to my house. He has stood by Harold&mdash;well, like a
Christian!'</p>
<p>'Or a Hindu,' the Maharajah corrected, smiling.</p>
<p>'And how have you been all this time, dear Lady Georgina?' I
asked, hardly daring to inquire about what was nearest to my
soul&mdash;Harold.</p>
<p>The cantankerous old lady knitted her brows in a<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
familiar fashion. 'Oh, my dear, don't ask: I haven't known a happy
hour since you left me in Switzerland. Lois, I shall never be happy
again without you! It would pay me to give you a retaining fee of a
thousand a year&mdash;honour bright, it would, I assure you. What
I've suffered from the Gretchens since you've been in the East has
only been equalled by what I've suffered from the Mary Annes and
the C&eacute;lestines. Not a hair left on my scalp; not one hair, I
declare to you. They've made my head into a <i>tabula rasa</i> for
the various restorers. George R. Sims and Mrs. S. A. Allen are
going to fight it out between them. My dear, I wish <i>you</i>
could take my maid's place; I've always said&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>I finished the speech for her. 'A lady can do better whatever
she turns her hand to than any of these hussies.'</p>
<p>She nodded. 'And why? Because her hands <i>are</i> hands; while
as for the Gretchens and the Mary Annes, "paws" is the only word
one can honestly apply to them. Then, on top of it all comes this
trouble about Harold. So distressing, isn't it? You see, at the
point which the matter has reached, it's simply impossible to save
Harold's reputation without wrecking Southminster's. Pretty
position that for a respectable family! The Ashursts hitherto have
been <i>quite</i> respectable: a co-respondent or two, perhaps, but
never anything serious. Now, either Southminster sends Harold to
prison, or Harold sends Southminster. There's a nice sort of
dilemma! I always knew Kynaston's boys were born fools; but to find
they're born knaves, too, is hard on an old woman in her hairless
dotage. However, <i>you've</i> come, my child, and <i>you'll</i>
soon set things right. You're the one person on earth I can trust
in this matter.'</p>
<p>Harold go to prison! My head reeled at the thought. I staggered
out into the open air, and took my seat mechanically in the
Maharajah's carriage. All London swam before<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> me.
After so many months' absence, the polychromatic decorations of our
English streets, looming up through the smoke, seemed both strange
and familiar. I drove through the first half mile with a vague
consciousness that Lipton's tea is the perfection of cocoa and
matchless for the complexion, but that it dyes all colours, and
won't wash clothes.</p>
<p>After a while, however, I woke up to the full terror of the
situation. 'Where are you taking me?' I inquired.</p>
<p>'To my house, dear,' Lady Georgina answered, looking anxiously
at me; for my face was bloodless.</p>
<p>'No, that won't do,' I answered. 'My cue must be now to keep
myself as aloof as possible from Harold and Harold's backers. I
must put up at an hotel. It will sound so much better in
cross-examination.'</p>
<p>'She's quite right,' the Maharajah broke in, with sudden
conviction. 'One must block every ball with these nasty swift
bowlers.'</p>
<p>'Where's Harold?' I asked, after another pause. 'Why didn't he
come to meet me?'</p>
<p>'My dear, how could he? He's under examination. A cross-eyed
Q.C. with an odious leer. Southminster's chosen the biggest bully
at the Bar to support his contention.'</p>
<p>'Drive to some hotel in the Jermyn Street district,' I cried to
the Maharajah's coachman. 'That will be handy for the law
courts.'</p>
<p>He touched his hat and turned. In a sort of dickey behind sat
two gorgeous-turbaned Rajput servants.</p>
<p>That evening Harold came round to visit me at my rooms. I could
see he was much agitated. Things had gone very badly. Lady Georgina
was there; she had stopped to dine with me, dear old thing, lest I
should feel lonely and give way; so had Elsie Petheridge. Mr.
Elworthy sent a telegram of welcome from Devonshire. I knew
at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg
260]</a></span> least that my friends were rallying round me in
this hour of trial. The kind Maharajah himself would have come too,
if I had allowed him, but I thought it inexpedient. They explained
everything to me. Harold had propounded Mr. Ashurst's
will&mdash;the one I drew up at Florence&mdash;and had asked for
probate. Lord Southminster intervened and opposed the grant of
probate on the ground that the signatures were forgeries. He
propounded instead another will, drawn some twenty years earlier,
when they were both children, duly executed at the time, and
undoubtedly genuine; in it, testator left everything without
reserve to the eldest son of his eldest brother, Lord Kynaston.</p>
<p>'Marmy didn't know in those days that Kynaston's sons would all
grow up fools,' Lady Georgina said tartly. 'Besides which, that was
before the poor dear soul took to plunging on the Stock Exchange
and made his money. He had nothing to leave then but his best silk
hat and a few paltry hundreds. Afterwards, when he'd feathered his
nest in soap and cocoa, he discovered that Bertie&mdash;that's Lord
Southminster&mdash;was a first-class idiot. Marmy never liked
Southminster, nor Southminster Marmy. For after all, with all his
faults, Marmy <i>was</i> a gentleman; while Bertie&mdash;well, my
dear, we needn't put a name to it. So he altered his will, as you
know, when he saw the sort of man Southminster turned out, and left
practically everything he possessed to Harold.'</p>
<p>'Who are the witnesses to the will?' I asked.</p>
<p>'There's the trouble. Who do you think? Why, Higginson's sister,
who was Marmy's <i>masseuse</i>, and a waiter&mdash;Franz
Markheim&mdash;at the hotel at Florence, who's dead they
say&mdash;or, at least, not forthcoming.'</p>
<p>'And Higginson's sister forswears her signature,' Harold added
gloomily; 'while the experts are, most of them, dead against the
genuineness of my uncle's.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261"
id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>
<p>'That's clever,' I said, leaning back, and taking it in slowly.
'Higginson's sister! How well they've worked it. They couldn't
prevent Mr. Ashurst from making this will, but they managed to
supply their own tainted witnesses! If it had been Higginson
himself now, he'd have had to be cross-examined; and in
cross-examination, of course, we could have shaken his credit, by
bringing up the episodes of the Count de Laroche-sur-Loiret and Dr.
Fortescue-Langley. But his sister! What's she like? Have you
anything against her?'</p>
<p>'My dear,' Lady Georgina cried, 'there the rogue has bested us.
Isn't it just like him? What do you suppose he has done? Why,
provided himself with a sister of tried respectability and
blameless character.'</p>
<p>'And she denies that it is her handwriting?' I asked.</p>
<p>'Declares on her Bible oath she never signed the document.'</p>
<p>I was fairly puzzled. It was a stupendously clever dodge.
Higginson must have trained up his sister for forty years in the
ways of wickedness, yet held her in reserve for this supreme
moment.</p>
<p>'And where is Higginson?' I asked.</p>
<p>Lady Georgina broke into a hysterical laugh. 'Where is he, my
dear? That's the question. With consummate strategy, the wretch has
disappeared into space at the last moment.'</p>
<p>'That's artful again,' I said. 'His presence could only damage
their case. I can see, of course, Lord Southminster has no need of
him.'</p>
<p>'Southminster's the wiliest fool that ever lived,' Harold broke
out bitterly. 'Under that mask of imbecility, he's a fox for
trickiness.'</p>
<p>I bit my lip. 'Well, if you succeed in evading him,'
I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg
262]</a></span> said, 'you will have cleared your character. And if
you don't&mdash;then, Harold, our time will have come: you will
have your longed-for chance of trying me.'</p>
<p>'That won't do me much good,' he answered, 'if I have to wait
fourteen years for you&mdash;at Portland.'</p>

<span class="caption">THE CROSS-EYED Q.C. BEGGED HIM TO BE VERY
CAREFUL.</span></div>
<p>Next morning, in court, I heard Harold's cross-examination. He
described exactly where he had found the contested will in his
uncle's escritoire. The cross-eyed Q.C, a heavy man with bloated
features and a bulbous nose, begged him, with one fat uplifted
forefinger, to be very careful. How did he know where to look for
it?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg
263]</a></span></p>
<p>'Because I knew the house well: I knew where my uncle was likely
to keep his valuables.'</p>
<p>'Oh, indeed; <i>not</i> because you had put it there?'</p>
<p>The court rang with laughter. My face grew crimson.</p>
<p>After an hour or two of fencing, Harold was dismissed. He stood
down, baffled. Counsel recalled Lord Southminster.</p>
<p>The pea-green young man, stepping briskly up, gazed about him,
open-mouthed, with a vacant stare. The look of cunning on his face
was carefully suppressed. He wore, on the contrary, an air of
injured innocence combined with an eye-glass.</p>
<p>'<i>You</i> did not put this will in the drawer where Mr.
Tillington found it, did you?' counsel asked.</p>
<p>The pea-green young man laughed. 'No, I certainly didn't put it
theah. My cousin Harold was man in possession. He took jolly good
care <i>I</i> didn't come neah the premises.'</p>
<p>'Do you think you could forge a will if you tried?'</p>
<p>Lord Southminster laughed. 'No, I don't,' he answered, with a
well-assumed <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>. 'That's just the
difference between us, don't yah know. <i>I'm</i> what they call a
fool, and my cousin Harold's a precious clevah fellah.'</p>
<p>There was another loud laugh.</p>
<p>'That's not evidence,' the judge observed, severely.</p>
<p>It was not. But it told far more than much that was. It told
strongly against Harold.</p>
<p>'Besides,' Lord Southminster continued, with engaging frankness,
'if I forged a will at all, I'd take jolly good care to forge it in
my own favah.'</p>
<p>My turn came next. Our counsel handed me the incriminated will.
'Did you draw up this document?' he asked.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>
<p>I looked at it closely. The paper bore our Florentine
water-mark, and was written with a Spread-Eagle. 'I type-wrote it,'
I answered, gazing at it with care to make sure I recognised
it.</p>
<p>Our counsel's business was to uphold the will, not to cast
aspersions upon it. He was evidently annoyed at my close
examination. 'You have no doubts about it?' he said, trying to
prompt me.</p>
<p>I hesitated. 'No, no doubts,' I answered, turning over the sheet
and inspecting it still closer. 'I type-wrote it at Florence.'</p>
<p>'Do you recognise that signature as Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst's?' he
went on.</p>
<p>I stared at it. Was it his? It was like it, certainly. Yet that
<i>k</i>? and those <i>s</i>'s? I almost wondered.</p>
<p>Counsel was obviously annoyed at my hesitation. He thought I was
playing into the enemy's hands. 'Is it his, or is it not?' he
inquired again, testily.</p>
<p>'It is his,' I answered. Yet I own I was troubled.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;"><a name="ILL_065" id=

<span class="caption">I WAS A GROTESQUE FAILURE.</span></div>
<p>He asked many questions about the circumstances of the interview
when I took down the will. I answered them all. But I vaguely felt
he and I were at cross-purposes. I grew almost as uncomfortable
under his gaze as if he had been examining me in the interest of
the other side. He managed to fluster me. As a witness for Harold,
I was a grotesque failure.</p>
<p>Then the cross-eyed Q.C., rising and shaking his huge bulk,
began to cross-examine me. 'Where did you type-write this thing, do
you say?' he said, pointing to it contemptuously.</p>
<p>'In my office at Florence.'</p>
<p>'Yes, I understand; you had an office in Florence&mdash;after
you gave up retailing bicycles on the public roads; and<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> you
had a partner, I think&mdash;a Miss Petherick, or Petherton, or
Pennyfarthing, or something?'</p>
<p>'Miss Petheridge,' I corrected, while the Court tittered.</p>
<p>'Ah, Petheridge, you call it! Well, now answer this question
carefully. Did your Miss Petheridge hear Mr. Ashurst dictate the
terms of his last will and testament?'</p>
<p>'No,' I answered. 'The interview was of a strictly confidential
character. Mr. Ashurst took me aside into the back room at our
office.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg
266]</a></span></p>
<p>'Oh, he took you aside? Confidential? Well, now we're getting at
it. And did anybody but yourself see or hear any part whatsoever of
this precious document?'</p>
<p>'Certainly not,' I replied. 'It was a private matter.'</p>
<p>'Private! oh, very! Nobody else saw it. Did Mr. Ashurst take it
away from the office in person?'</p>
<p>'No; he sent his courier for it.'</p>
<p>'His courier? The man Higginson?'</p>
<p>'Yes; but I refused to give it to Higginson. I took it myself
that night to the hotel where Mr. Ashurst was stopping.'</p>
<p>'Ah! You took it yourself. So the only other person who knows
anything at first hand about the existence of the alleged will is
this person Higginson?'</p>
<p>'Miss Petheridge knows,' I said, flushing. 'At the time, I told
her of it.'</p>
<p>'Oh, <i>you</i> told her. Well, that doesn't help us much. If
what you are swearing isn't true&mdash;remember, you are on your
oath&mdash;what you told Miss Petherick or Petheridge or
Pennyfarthing, "at the time," can hardly be regarded as
corroborative evidence. Your word then and your word now are just
equally valuable&mdash;or equally worthless. The only person who
knows besides yourself is Higginson. Now, I ask you, <i>where</i>
is Higginson? <i>Are</i> you going to produce him?'</p>
<p>The wicked cunning of it struck me dumb. They were keeping him
away, and then using his absence to cast doubts on my veracity.
'Stop,' I cried, taken aback, 'Higginson is well known to be a
rogue, and he is keeping away lest he may damage your side. I know
nothing of Higginson.'</p>
<p>'Yes, I'm coming to that in good time. Don't be afraid that
we're going to pass over Higginson. You admit<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> this
man is a man of bad character. Now, what do you know of him?'</p>
<p>I told the stories of the Count and of Dr.
Fortescue-Langley.</p>
<p>The cross-eyed cross-examiner leant across towards me and
leered. 'And this is the man,' he exclaimed, with a triumphant air,
'whose sister you pretended you had got to sign this precious
document of yours?'</p>
<p>'Whom Mr. Ashurst got to sign it,' I answered, red-hot. 'It is
not <i>my</i> document.'</p>
<p>'And you have heard that she swears it is not her signature at
all?'</p>
<p>'So they tell me. She is Higginson's sister. For all I know, she
may be prepared to swear, or to forswear, anything.'</p>
<p>'Don't cast doubt upon our witnesses without cause! Miss
Higginson is an eminently respectable woman. You gave this document
to Mr. Ashurst, you say. There your knowledge of it ends. A
signature is placed on it which is not his, as our experts testify.
It purports to be witnessed by a Swiss waiter, who is not
forthcoming, and who is asserted to be dead, as well as by a nurse
who denies her signature. And the only other person who knows of
its existence before Mr. Tillington "discovers" it in his uncle's
desk is&mdash;the missing man Higginson. Is that, or is it not, the
truth of the matter?'</p>
<p>'I suppose so,' I said, baffled.</p>
<p>'Well, now, as to this man Higginson. He first appears upon the
scene, so far as you are concerned, on the day when you travelled
from London to Schlangenbad?'</p>
<p>'That is so,' I answered.</p>
<p>'And he nearly succeeded then in stealing Lady Georgina Fawley's
jewel-case?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id=
"Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>
<p>'He nearly took it, but I saved it.' And I explained the
circumstance.</p>
<p>The cross-eyed Q.C. held his fat sides with his hands, looking
incredulously at me, and smiled. His vast width of waistcoat shook
with silent merriment. 'You are a very clever young lady,' he
murmured. 'You can explain away anything. But don't you think it
just as likely that it was a plot between you two, and that owing
to some mistake the plot came off unsuccessful?'</p>
<p>'I do not,' I cried, crimson. 'I never saw the Count before that
morning.'</p>
<p>He tried another tack. 'Still, wherever you went, this man
Higginson&mdash;the only other person, you admit, who knows about
the previous existence of the will&mdash;turned up simultaneously.
He was always turning up&mdash;at the same place as you did. He
turned up at Lucerne, as a faith-healer, didn't he?'</p>
<p>'If you will allow me to explain,' I cried, biting my lip.</p>
<p>He bowed, all blandness. 'Oh, certainly,' he murmured. 'Explain
away everything!'</p>
<p>I explained, but of course he had discounted and damaged my
explanation.</p>
<p>He made no comment. 'And then,' he went on, with his hands on
his hips, and his obtrusive rotundity, 'he turned up at Florence,
as courier to Mr. Ashurst, at the very date when this so-called
will was being concocted?'</p>
<p>'He was at Florence when Mr. Ashurst dictated it to me,' I
answered, growing desperate.</p>
<p>'You admit he was in Florence. Good! Once more he turned up in
India with my client, Lord Southminster, upon whose youth and
inexperience he had managed to impose himself. And he carried him
off, did he not, by one of these strange coincidences to which
<i>you</i> are peculiarly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269"
id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> liable, on the very same steamer
on which <i>you</i> happened to be travelling?'</p>
<p>'Lord Southminster told me he took Higginson with him because a
rogue suited his book,' I answered, warmly.</p>
<p>'Will you swear his lordship didn't say "<i>the</i> rogue suited
his book"&mdash;which is quite another thing?' the Q.C. asked
blandly.</p>
<p>'I will swear he did not,' I replied. 'I have correctly reported
him.'</p>
<p>'Then I congratulate you, young lady, on your excellent memory.
My lud, will you allow me later to recall Lord Southminster to
testify on this point?'</p>
<p>The judge nodded.</p>
<p>'Now, once more, as to your relations with the various members
of the Ashurst family. You introduced yourself to Lady Georgina
Fawley, I believe, quite casually, on a seat in Kensington
Gardens?'</p>
<p>'That is true,' I answered.</p>
<p>'You had never seen her before?'</p>
<p>'Never.'</p>
<p>'And you promptly offered to go with her as her lady's maid to
Schlangenbad in Germany?'</p>
<p>'In place of her lady's maid, for one week,' I answered.</p>
<p>'Ah; a delicate distinction! "In place of her lady's maid." You
are a lady, I believe; an officer's daughter, you told us; educated
at Girton?'</p>
<p>'So I have said already,' I replied, crimson.</p>
<p>'And you stick to it? By all means. Tell&mdash;the
truth&mdash;and stick to it. It's always safest. Now, don't you
think it was rather an odd thing for an officer's daughter to
do&mdash;to run about Germany as maid to a lady of title?'</p>

height="316" alt="THE JURY SMILED." title=""> <span class=

<p>I tried to explain once more; but the jury smiled.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> You
can't justify originality to a British jury. Why, they would send
you to prison at once for that alone, if they made the laws as well
as dispensing them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id=

<p>He passed on after a while to another topic. 'I think you have
boasted more than once in society that when you first met Lady
Georgina Fawley you had twopence in your pocket to go round the
world with?'</p>
<p>'I had,' I answered&mdash;'and I went round the world with
it.'</p>
<p>'Exactly. I'm getting there in time. With it&mdash;and other
things. A few months later, more or less, you were touring up the
Nile in your steam dahabeeah, and in the lap of luxury; you were
taking saloon-carriages on Indian railways, weren't you?'</p>
<p>I explained again. 'The dahabeeah was in the service of the
<i>Daily Telephone</i>,' I answered. 'I became a journalist.'</p>
<p>He cross-questioned me about that. 'Then I am to understand,' he
said at last, leaning forward with all his waistcoat, 'that you
sprang yourself upon Mr. Elworthy at sight, pretty much as you
sprang yourself upon Lady Georgina Fawley?'</p>
<p>'We arranged matters quickly,' I admitted. The dexterous wretch
was making my strongest points all tell against me.</p>
<p>'H'm! Well, he was a man: and you will admit, I suppose,'
fingering his smooth fat chin, 'that you are a lady of&mdash;what
is the stock phrase the reporters use?&mdash;considerable personal
attractions?'</p>
<p>'My Lord,' I said, turning to the Bench, 'I appeal to you. Has
he the right to compel me to answer that question?'</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 416px;"><a name="ILL_067" id=

<p>The judge bowed slightly. 'The question requires no answer,' he
said, with a quiet emphasis. I burned bright scarlet.</p>
<p>'Well, my lud, I defer to your ruling,' the cross-eyed
cross-examiner continued, radiant. 'I go on to another<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
point. When in India, I believe, you stopped for some time as a
guest in the house of a native Maharajah.'</p>
<p>'Is that matter relevant?' the judge asked, sharply.</p>
<p>'My lud,' the Q.C. said, in his blandest voice, 'I am striving
to suggest to the jury that this lady&mdash;the only person who
ever beheld this so-called will till Mr. Harold
Tillington&mdash;described in its terms as "Younger of
Gledcliffe,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id=
"Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> whatever that may be&mdash;produced
it out of his uncle's desk&mdash; I am striving to suggest that
this lady is&mdash;my duty to my client compels me to say&mdash;an
adventuress.'</p>
<p>He had uttered the word. I felt my character had not a leg left
to stand upon before a British jury.</p>
<p>'I went there with my friend, Miss Petheridge&mdash;&mdash;' I
began.</p>
<p>'Oh, Miss Petheridge once more&mdash;you hunt in couples?'</p>
<p>'Accompanied and chaperoned by a married lady, the wife of a
Major Balmossie, on the Bombay Staff Corps.'</p>
<p>'That was certainly prudent. One ought to be chaperoned. Can you
produce the lady?'</p>
<p>'How is it possible?' I cried. 'Mrs. Balmossie is in India.'</p>
<p>'Yes; but the Maharajah, I understand, is in London?'</p>
<p>'That is true,' I answered.</p>
<p>'And he came to meet you on your arrival yesterday.'</p>
<p>'With Lady Georgina Fawley,' I cried, taken off my guard.</p>
<p>'Do you not consider it curious,' he asked, 'that these
Higginsons and these Maharajahs should happen to follow you so
closely round the world?&mdash;should happen to turn up wherever
you do?'</p>
<p>'He came to be present at this trial,' I exclaimed.</p>
<p>'And so did you. I believe he met you at Euston last night, and
drove you to your hotel in his private carriage.'</p>
<p>'With Lady Georgina Fawley,' I answered, once more.</p>
<p>'And Lady Georgina is on Mr. Tillington's side, I fancy? Ah,
yes, I thought so. And Mr. Tillington also called to see you; and
likewise Miss Petherick&mdash; I beg your pardon, Petheridge. We
must be strictly accurate&mdash;where Miss Petheridge is concerned.
And, in fact, you had quite a little family party.'<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>
<p>'My friends were glad to see me back again,' I murmured.</p>
<p>He sprang a fresh innuendo. 'But Mr. Tillington did not resent
your visit to this gallant Maharajah?'</p>
<p>'Certainly not,' I cried, bridling. 'Why should he?'</p>
<p>'Oh, we're getting to that too. Now answer me this carefully. We
want to find out what interest you might have, supposing a will
were forged, on either side, in arranging its terms. We want to
find out just who would benefit by it. Please reply to this
question, yes or no, without prevarication. Are you or are you not
conditionally engaged to Mr. Harold Tillington?'</p>
<p>'If I might explain&mdash;&mdash;' I began, quivering.</p>
<p>He sneered. 'You have a genius for explaining, we are aware.
Answer me first, yes or no; we will qualify afterward.'</p>
<p>I glanced appealingly at the judge. He was adamant. 'Answer as
counsel directs you, witness,' he said, sternly.</p>
<p>'Yes, I am,' I faltered. 'But&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Excuse me one moment. You promised to marry him conditionally
upon the result of Mr. Ashurst's testamentary dispositions?'</p>
<p>'I did,' I answered; 'but&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>My explanation was drowned in roars of laughter, in which the
judge joined, in spite of himself. When the mirth in court had
subsided a little, I went on: 'I told Mr. Tillington I would only
marry him in case he was poor and without expectations. If he
inherited Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst's money, I could never be his
wife,' I said it proudly.</p>
<p>The cross-eyed Q.C. drew himself up and let his rotundity take
care of itself. 'Do you take me,' he inquired, 'for one of Her
Majesty's horse-marines?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275"
id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>
<p>There was another roar of laughter&mdash;feebly suppressed by a
judicial frown&mdash;and I slank away, annihilated.</p>
<p>'You can go,' my persecutor said. 'I think we have
got&mdash;well, everything we wanted from you. You promised to
marry him, if all went ill! That is a delicate feminine way of
putting it. Women like these equivocations. They relieve one from
the onus of speaking frankly.'</p>
<p>I stood down from the box, feeling, for the first time in my
life, conscious of having scored an ignominious failure.</p>
<p>Our counsel did not care to re-examine me; I recognised that it
would be useless. The hateful Q.C. had put all my history in such
an odious light that explanation could only make matters
worse&mdash;it must savour of apology. The jury could never
understand my point of view. It could never be made to see that
there are adventuresses and adventuresses.</p>
<p>Then came the final speeches on either side. Harold's advocate
said the best he could in favour of the will our party propounded;
but his best was bad; and what galled me most was this&mdash; I
could see he himself did not believe in its genuineness. His speech
amounted to little more than a perfunctory attempt to put the most
favourable face on a probable forgery.</p>
<p>As for the cross-eyed Q.C., he rose to reply with humorous
confidence. Swaying his big body to and fro, he crumpled our will
and our case in his fat fingers like so much flimsy tissue-paper.
Mr. Ashurst had made a disposition of his property twenty years
ago&mdash;the right disposition, the natural disposition; he had
left the bulk of it as childless English gentlemen have ever been
wont to leave their wealth&mdash;to the eldest son of the eldest
son of his family. The Honourable Marmaduke Courtney Ashurst, the
testator, was the scion of a great house, which recent agricultural
changes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg
276]</a></span> he regretted to say, had relatively impoverished;
he had come to the succour of that great house, as such a scion
should, with his property acquired by honest industry elsewhere. It
was fitting and reasonable that Mr. Ashurst should wish to see the
Kynaston peerage regain, in the person of the amiable and
accomplished young nobleman whom he had the honour to represent,
some portion of its ancient dignity and splendour.</p>
<p>But jealousy and greed intervened. (Here he frowned at Harold.)
Mr. Harold Tillington, the son of one of Mr. Ashurst's married
sisters, cast longing eyes, as he had tried to suggest to them, on
his cousin Lord Southminster's natural heritage. The result, he
feared, was an unnatural intrigue. Mr. Harold Tillington formed the
acquaintance of a young lady&mdash;should we say young
lady?&mdash;(he withered me with his glance)&mdash;well, yes, a
lady, indeed, by birth and education, but an adventuress by
choice&mdash;a lady who, brought up in a respectable, though not
(he must admit) a distinguished sphere, had lowered herself by
accepting the position of a lady's maid, and had trafficked in
patent American cycles on the public high-roads of Germany and
Switzerland. This clever and designing woman (he would grant her
ability&mdash;he would grant her good looks) had fascinated Mr.
Tillington&mdash;that was the theory he ventured to lay before the
jury to-day; and the jury would see for themselves that whatever
else the young lady might be, she had distinctly a certain outer
gift of fascination. It was for them to decide whether Miss Lois
Cayley had or had not suggested to Mr. Harold Tillington the design
of substituting a forged will for Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst's
undeniable testament. He would point out to them her singular
connection with the missing man Higginson, whom the young lady
herself described as a rogue, and from whom she had done her
very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg
277]</a></span> best to dissociate herself in this court&mdash;but
ineffectually. Wherever Miss Cayley went, the man Higginson went
independently. Such frequent recurrences, such apt juxtapositions
could hardly be set down to mere accidental coincidence.</p>
<p>He went on to insinuate that Higginson and I had concocted the
disputed will between us; that we had passed it on to our
fellow-conspirator, Harold; and that Harold had forged his uncle's
signature to it, and had appended those of the two supposed
witnesses. But who, now, were these witnesses? One, Franz Markheim,
was dead or missing; dead men tell no tales: the other was
obviously suggested by Higginson. It was his own sister. Perhaps he
forged her name to the document. Doubtless he thought that family
feeling would induce her, when it came to the pinch, to accept and
endorse her brother's lie; nay, he might even have been foolish
enough to suppose that this cock-and-bull will would not be
disputed. If so, he and his master had reckoned without Lord
Southminster, a gentleman who concealed beneath the careless
exterior of a man of fashion the solid intelligence of a man of
affairs, and the hard head of a man not to be lightly cheated in
matters of business.</p>
<p>The alleged will had thus not a leg to stand upon. It was
'typewritten' (save the mark!) 'from dictation' at Florence, by
whom? By the lady who had most to gain from its success&mdash;the
lady who was to be transformed from a shady adventuress, tossed
about between Irish doctors and Hindu Maharajahs, into the lawful
wife of a wealthy diplomatist of noble family, on one condition
only&mdash;if this pretended will could be satisfactorily
established. The signatures were forgeries, as shown by the expert
evidence, and also by the oath of the one surviving
witness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg

<p>The will left all the estate&mdash;practically&mdash;to Mr.
Harold Tillington, and five hundred pounds to whom?&mdash;why, to
the accomplice Higginson. The minor bequests the Q.C. regarded as
ingenious inventions, pure play of fancy, 'intended to give
artistic verisimilitude,' as Pooh-Bah says in the opera, 'to an
otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative.' The fads, it was true,
were known fads of Mr. Ashurst's: but what sort of fads?
Bimetallism? Anglo-Israel? No, braces and shoe-horns&mdash;clearly
the kind that would best be known to a courier like Higginson, the
sole begetter, he believed, of this nefarious conspiracy.</p>

<p>The cross-eyed Q.C., lifting his fat right hand in solemn
adjuration, called upon the jury confidently to set aside this
ridiculous fabrication, and declare for a will of undoubted
genuineness, a will drawn up in London by a firm of eminent
solicitors, and preserved ever since by the testator's bankers. It
would then be for his lordship to decide whether in the public
interest he should recommend the Crown to prosecute on a charge of
forgery the clumsy fabricator of this preposterous document.</p>
<p>The judge summed up&mdash;strongly in favour of Lord
Southminster's will. If the jury believed the experts and Miss
Higginson, one verdict alone was possible. The jury retired for
three minutes only. It was a foregone conclusion. They found for
Lord Southminster. The judge, looking grave, concurred in their
finding. A most proper verdict. And he considered it would be the
duty of the Public Prosecutor to pursue Mr. Harold Tillington on
the charge of forgery.</p>
<p>I reeled where I sat. Then I looked round for Harold.</p>
<p>He had slipped from the court, unseen, during counsel's address,
some minutes earlier!</p>
<p>That distressed me more than anything else on that<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
dreadful day. I wished he had stood up in his place like a man to
face this vile and cruel conspiracy.</p>
<p>I walked out slowly, supported by Lady Georgina, who was as
white as a ghost herself, but very straight and<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
scornful. 'I always knew Southminster was a fool,' she said aloud;
'I always knew he was a sneak; but I did not know till now he was
also a particularly bad type of criminal.'</p>
<p>On the steps of the court, the pea-green young man met us. His
air was jaunty. 'Well, I was right, yah see,' he said, smiling and
withdrawing his cigarette. 'You backed the wrong fellah! I told you
I'd win. I won't say moah now; this is not the time or place to
recur to that subject; but, by-and-by, you'll come round; you'll
think bettah of it still; you'll back the winnah!'</p>
<p>I wished I were a man, that I might have the pleasure of kicking
him.</p>
<p>We drove back to my hotel and waited for Harold. To my horror
and alarm, he never came near us. I might almost have doubted
him&mdash;if he had not been Harold.</p>
<p>I waited and waited. He did not come at all. He sent no word, no
message. And all that evening we heard the newsboys shouting at the
top of their voice in the street, 'Extra Speshul! the Ashurst Will
Kise; Sensational Developments' 'Mysterious Disappearance of Mr.
'Arold Tillington.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id=

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI</h2>
<h3>THE ADVENTURE OF THE ORIENTAL ATTENDANT</h3>
<p>I did not sleep that night. Next morning, I rose very early from
a restless bed with a dry, hot mouth, and a general feeling that
the solid earth had failed beneath me.</p>
<p>Still no news from Harold! It was cruel, I thought. My faith
almost flagged. He was a man and should be brave. How could he run
away and hide himself at such a time? Even if I set my own anxiety
aside, just think to what serious misapprehension it laid him
open!</p>
<p>I sent out for the morning papers. They were full of Harold.
Rumours, rumours, rumours! Mr. Tillington had deliberately chosen
to put himself in the wrong by disappearing mysteriously at the
last moment. He had only himself to blame if the worst
interpretation were put upon his action. But the police were on his
track; Scotland Yard had 'a clue': it was confidently expected an
arrest would be made before evening at latest. As to details,
authorities differed. The officials of the Great Western Railway at
Paddington were convinced that Mr. Tillington had started, alone
and undisguised, by the night express for Exeter. The South-Eastern
inspectors at Charing Cross, on the other hand, were equally
certain that he had slipped away with a false beard, in company
with his 'accomplice' Higginson, by the 8.15<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">p.m.</span> to Paris. Everybody took it for
granted, however, that he had left London.</p>
<p>Conjecture played with various ultimate
destinations&mdash;Spain, Morocco, Sicily, the Argentine. In Italy,
said the <i>Chronicle</i>, he might lurk for a while&mdash;he spoke
Italian fluently, and could manage to put up at tiny <i>osterie</i>
in out-of-the-way places seldom visited by Englishmen. He might try
Albania, said the <i>Morning Post</i>, airing its exclusive
'society' information: he had often hunted there, and might in turn
be hunted. He would probably attempt to slink away to some remote
spot in the Carpathians or the Balkans, said the <i>Daily News</i>,
quite proud of its geography. Still, wherever he went,
leaden-footed justice in this age, said the <i>Times</i>, must
surely overtake him. The day of universal extradition had dawned;
we had no more Alsatias: even the Argentine itself gives up its
rogues&mdash;at last; not an asylum for crime remains in Europe,
not a refuge in Asia, Africa, America, Australia, or the Pacific
Islands.</p>
<p>I noted with a shudder of horror that all the papers alike took
his guilt as certain. In spite of a few decent pretences at not
prejudging an untried cause, they treated him already as the
detected criminal, the fugitive from justice. I sat in my little
sitting-room at the hotel in Jermyn Street, a limp rag, looking
idly out of the window with swimming eyes, and waiting for Lady
Georgina. It was early, too early, but&mdash;oh, why didn't she
come! Unless <i>somebody</i> soon sympathised with me, my heart
would break under this load of loneliness!</p>
<p>Presently, as I looked out on the sloppy morning street, I was
vaguely aware through the mist that floated before my dry eyes (for
tears were denied me) of a very grand carriage driving up to the
doorway&mdash;the porch with the four wooden Ionic pillars. I took
no heed of it. I was too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283"
id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> heart-sick for observation. My
life was wrecked, and Harold's with it. Yet, dimly through the
mist, I became conscious after a while that the carriage was that
of an Indian prince; I could see the black faces, the white
turbans, the gold brocades of the attendants in the dickey. Then it
came home to me with a pang that this was the Maharajah.</p>
<p>It was kindly meant; yet after all that had been insinuated in
court the day before, I was by no means over-pleased that his dusky
Highness should come to call upon me. Walls have eyes and ears.
Reporters were hanging about all over London, eager to distinguish
themselves by successful eavesdropping. They would note, with brisk
innuendoes after their kind, how 'the Maharajah of Moozuffernuggar
called early in the day on Miss Lois Cayley, with whom he remained
for at least half an hour in close consultation.' I had half a mind
to send down a message that I could not see him. My face still
burned with the undeserved shame of the cross-eyed Q.C.'s
unspeakable suggestions.</p>
<p>Before I could make my mind up, however, I saw to my surprise
that the Maharajah did not propose to come in himself. He leaned
back in his place with his lordly Eastern air, and waited, looking
down on the gapers in the street, while one of the two gorgeous
attendants in the dickey descended obsequiously to receive his
orders. The man was dressed as usual in rich Oriental stuffs, and
wore his full white turban swathed in folds round his head. I could
not see his features. He bent forward respectfully with Oriental
suppleness to take his Highness's orders. Then, receiving a card
and bowing low, he entered the porch with the wooden Ionic pillars,
and disappeared within, while the Maharajah folded his hands and
seemed to resign himself to a temporary Nirvana.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="ILL_069" id=

height="532" alt="THE MESSENGER ENTERED." title=""> <span class=
"caption">THE MESSENGER ENTERED.</span></div>
<p>A minute later, a knock sounded on my door. 'Come in!' I said,
faintly; and the messenger entered.</p>
<p>I turned and faced him. The blood rushed to my cheek. 'Harold!'
I cried, darting forward. My joy overcame me. He folded me in his
arms. I allowed him, unreproved. For the first time he kissed me. I
did not shrink from it.</p>
<p>Then I stood away a little and gazed at him. Even at that
crucial moment of doubt and fear, I could not help<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
noticing how admirably he made up as a handsome young Rajput. Three
years earlier, at Schlangenbad, I remembered he had struck me as
strangely Oriental-looking: he had the features of a high-born
Indian gentleman, without the complexion. His large, poetical eyes,
his regular, oval face, his even teeth, his mouth and moustache,
all vaguely recalled the highest type of the Eastern temperament.
Now, he had blackened his face and hands with some permanent
stain&mdash;Indian ink, I learned later&mdash;and the resemblance
to a Rajput chief was positively startling. In his gold brocade and
ample white turban, no passer-by, I felt sure, would ever have
dreamt of doubting him.</p>
<p>'Then you knew me at once?' he said, holding my face between his
hands. 'That's bad, darling! I flattered myself I had transformed
my face into the complete Indian.'</p>
<p>'Love has sharp eyes,' I answered. 'It can see through brick
walls. But the disguise is perfect. No one else would detect
you.'</p>
<p>'Love is blind, I thought.'</p>
<p>'Not where it ought to see. There, it pierces everything. I knew
you instantly, Harold. But all London, I am sure, would pass you
by, unknown. You are absolute Orient.'</p>
<p>'That's well; for all London is looking for me,' he answered,
bitterly. 'The streets bristle with detectives. Southminster's
knaveries have won the day. So I have tried this disguise.
Otherwise, I should have been arrested the moment the jury brought
in their verdict.'</p>
<p>'And why were you not?' I asked, drawing back. 'Oh, Harold, I
trust you; but why did you disappear and make all the world believe
you admitted yourself guilty?'</p>
<p>He opened his arms. 'Can't you guess?' he cried, holding them
out to me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id=
"Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>
<p>I nestled in them once more; but I answered through my
tears&mdash;I had found tears now&mdash;'No Harold; it baffles
me.'</p>
<p>'You remember what you promised me?' he murmured, leaning over
me and clasping me. 'If ever I were poor, friendless,
hunted&mdash;you would marry me. Now the opportunity has come when
we can both prove ourselves. To-day, except you and dear Georgey, I
haven't a friend in the world. Everyone else has turned against me.
Southminster holds the field. I am a suspected forger; in a very
few days I shall doubtless be a convicted felon. Unjustly, as you
know; yet still&mdash;we must face it&mdash;a convicted felon. So I
have come to claim you. I have come to ask you now, in this moment
of despair, will you keep your promise?'</p>
<p>I lifted my face to his. He bent over it trembling. I whispered
the words in his ear. 'Yes, Harold, I will keep it. I have always
loved you. And now I will marry you.'</p>
<p>'I knew you would!' he cried, and pressed me to his bosom.</p>
<p>We sat for some minutes, holding each other's hands, and saying
nothing; we were too full of thought for words. Then suddenly,
Harold roused himself. 'We must make haste, darling,' he cried. 'We
are keeping Partab outside, and every minute is precious, every
minute's delay dangerous. We ought to go down at once. Partab's
carriage is waiting at the door for us.'</p>
<p>'Go down?' I exclaimed, clinging to him. 'How? Why? I don't
understand. What is your programme?'</p>
<p>'Ah, I forgot I hadn't explained to you! Listen here,
dearest&mdash;quick; I can waste no words over it. I said just now
I had no friends in the world but you and Georgey. That's not true,
for dear old Partab has stuck to me nobly.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> When
all my English friends fell away, the Rajput was true to me. He
arranged all this; it was his own idea; he foresaw what was coming.
He urged me yesterday, just before the verdict (when he saw my
acquaintances beginning to look askance), to slip quietly out of
court, and make my way by unobtrusive roads to his house in Curzon
Street. There, he darkened my face like his, and converted me to
Hinduism. I don't suppose the disguise will serve me for more than
a day or two; but it will last long enough for us to get safely
away to Scotland.'</p>
<p>'Scotland?' I murmured. 'Then you mean to try a Scotch
marriage?'</p>
<p>'It is the only thing possible. We must be married to-day, and
in England, of course, we cannot do it. We would have to be called
in church, or else to procure a license, either of which would
involve disclosure of my identity. Besides, even the license would
keep us waiting about for a day or two. In Scotland, on the other
hand, we can be married at once. Partab's carriage is below, to
take you to King's Cross. He is staunch as steel, dear fellow. Do
you consent to go with me?'</p>
<p>My faculty for promptly making up such mind as I possess stood
me once more in good stead. 'Implicitly,' I answered. 'Dear Harold,
this calamity has its happy side&mdash;for without it, much as I
love you, I could never have brought myself to marry you!'</p>
<p>'One moment,' he cried. 'Before you go, recollect, this step is
irrevocable. You will marry a man who may be torn from you this
evening, and from whom fourteen years of prison may separate
you.'</p>
<p>'I know it,' I cried, through my tears. 'But&mdash; I shall be
showing my confidence in you, my love for you.'</p>
<p>He kissed me once more, fervently. 'This makes<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
amends for all,' he cried. 'Lois, to have won such a woman as you,
I would go through it all a thousand times over. It was for this,
and for this alone, that I hid myself last night. I wanted to give
you the chance of showing me how much, how truly you loved me.'</p>
<p>'And after we are married?' I asked, trembling.</p>
<p>'I shall give myself up at once to the police in Edinburgh.'</p>
<p>I clung to him wistfully. My heart half urged me to urge him to
escape. But I knew that was wrong. 'Give yourself up, then,' I
said, sobbing. 'It is a brave man's place. You must stand your
trial; and, come what will, I will strive to bear it with you.'</p>
<p>'I knew you would,' he cried. 'I was not mistaken in you.'</p>
<p>We embraced again, just once. It was little enough after those
years of waiting.</p>
<p>'Now, come!' he cried. 'Let us go.'</p>
<p>I drew back. 'Not with you, dearest,' I whispered. 'Not in the
Maharajah's carriage. You must start by yourself. I will follow you
at once, to King's Cross, in a hansom.'</p>
<p>He saw I was right. It would avoid suspicion, and it would
prevent more scandal. He withdrew without a word. 'We meet,' I
said, 'at ten, at King's Cross Station.'</p>
<p>I did not even wait to wash the tears from my eyes. All red as
they were, I put on my hat and my little brown travelling jacket. I
don't think I so much as glanced once at the glass. The seconds
were precious. I saw the Maharajah drive away, with Harold in the
dickey, arms crossed, imperturbable, Orientally silent. He looked
the very counterpart of the Rajput by his side. Then I descended
the stairs and walked out boldly. As I passed through the hall, the
servants and the visitors stared at me and whispered.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> They
spoke with nods and liftings of the eyebrows. I was aware that that
morning I had achieved notoriety.</p>
<p>At Piccadilly Circus, I jumped of a sudden into a passing
hansom. 'King's Cross!' I cried, as I mounted the step. 'Drive
quick! I have no time to spare.' And, as the man drove off, I saw,
by a convulsive dart of someone across the road, that I had given
the slip to a disappointed reporter.</p>
<p>At the station I took a first-class ticket for Edinburgh. On the
platform, the Maharajah and his attendants were waiting. He lifted
his hat to me, though otherwise he took no overt notice. But I saw
his keen eyes follow me down the train. Harold, in his Oriental
dress, pretended not to observe me. One or two porters, and a few
curious travellers, cast inquiring eyes on the Eastern prince, and
made remarks about him to one another. 'That's the chap as was up
yesterday in the Ashurst will kise!' said one lounger to his
neighbour. But nobody seemed to look at Harold; his subordinate
position secured him from curiosity. The Maharajah had always two
Eastern servants, gorgeously dressed, in attendance; he had been a
well-known figure in London society, and at Lord's and the Oval,
for two or three seasons.</p>
<p>'Bloomin' fine cricketer!' one porter observed to his mate as he
passed.</p>
<p>'Yuss; not so dusty for a nigger,' the other man replied.
'Fust-rite bowler; but, Lord, he can't 'old a candle to good old
Ranji.'</p>
<p>As for myself, nobody seemed to recognise me. I set this fact
down to the fortunate circumstance that the evening papers had
published rough wood-cuts which professed to be my portrait, and
which naturally led the public to look out for a brazen-faced,
raw-boned, hard-featured termagant.</p>
<p>I took my seat in a ladies' compartment by myself.
As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg
290]</a></span> the train was about to start, Harold strolled up as
if casually for a moment. 'You think it better so?' he queried,
without moving his lips or seeming to look at me.</p>
<p>'Decidedly,' I answered. 'Go back to Partab. Don't come near me
again till we get to Edinburgh. It is dangerous still. The police
may at any moment hear we have started and stop us half-way; and
now that we have once committed ourselves to this plan it would be
fatal to be interrupted before we have got married.'</p>
<p>'You are right,' he cried; 'Lois, you are always right,
somehow.'</p>
<p>I wished I could think so myself; but 'twas with serious
misgivings that I felt the train roll out of the station.</p>
<p>Oh, that long journey north, alone, in a ladies'
compartment&mdash;with the feeling that Harold was so near, yet so
unapproachable: it was an endless agony. <i>He</i> had the
Maharajah, who loved and admired him, to keep him from brooding;
but I, left alone, and confined with my own fears, conjured up
before my eyes every possible misfortune that Heaven could send us.
I saw clearly now that if we failed in our purpose this journey
would be taken by everyone for a flight, and would deepen the
suspicion under which we both laboured. It would make me still more
obviously a conspirator with Harold.</p>
<p>Whatever happened, we must strain every nerve to reach Scotland
in safety, and then to get married, in order that Harold might
immediately surrender himself.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 495px;"><a name="ILL_070" id=

height="500" alt="HE TOOK A LONG, CARELESS STARE AT ME." title="">
<span class="caption">HE TOOK A LONG, CARELESS STARE AT
ME.</span></div>
<p>At York, I noticed with a thrill of terror that a man in plain
clothes, with the obtrusively unobtrusive air of a detective,
looked carefully though casually into every carriage. I felt sure
he was a spy, because of his marked outer jauntiness of demeanour,
which hardly masked an underlying hang-dog expression of scrutiny.
When he reached my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id=
"Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> place, he took a long, careless
stare at me&mdash;a seemingly careless stare, which was yet
brim-full of the keenest observation. Then he paced slowly along
the line of carriages, with a glance at each, till he arrived just
opposite the Maharajah's compartment. There he stared hard once
more. The Maharajah descended; so did Harold and the Hindu
attendant, who was dressed just like him. The man I took for a
detective indulged in a frank, long gaze at the unconscious Indian
prince, but cast only a hasty eye on the two apparent followers.
That touch of revelation relieved my mind a little. I felt
convinced the police were watching<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> the Maharajah and
myself, as suspicious persons connected with the case; but they had
not yet guessed that Harold had disguised himself as one of the two
invariable Rajput servants.</p>
<p>We steamed on northward. At Newcastle, the same detective
strolled, with his hands in his pockets, along the train once more,
and puffed a cigar with the nonchalant air of a sporting gentleman.
But I was certain now, from the studious unconcern he was anxious
to exhibit, that he must be a spy upon us. He overdid his mood of
careless observation. It was too obvious an assumption. Precisely
the same thing happened again when we pulled up at Berwick. I knew
now that we were watched. It would be impossible for us to get
married at Edinburgh if we were thus closely pursued. There was but
one chance open; we must leave the train abruptly at the first
Scotch stopping station.</p>
<p>The detective knew we were booked through for Edinburgh. So much
I could tell, because I saw him make inquiries of the ticket
examiner at York, and again at Berwick, and because the
ticket-examiner thereupon entered a mental note of the fact as he
punched my ticket each time: 'Oh, Edinburgh, miss? All right'; and
then stared at me suspiciously. I could tell he had heard of the
Ashurst will case. He also lingered long about the Maharajah's
compartment, and then went back to confer with the detective. Thus,
putting two and two together, as a woman will, I came to the
conclusion that the spy did not expect us to leave the train before
we reached Edinburgh. That told in our favour. Most men trust much
to just such vague expectations. They form a theory, and then
neglect the adverse chances. You can only get the better of a
skilled detective by taking him thus, psychologically and
humanly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg
293]</a></span></p>
<p>By this time, I confess, I felt almost like a criminal. Never in
my life had danger loomed so near&mdash;not even when we returned
with the Arabs from the oasis. For then we feared for our lives
alone; now, we feared for our honour.</p>
<p>I drew a card from my case before we left Berwick station, and
scribbled a few hasty words on it in German. 'We are watched. A
detective! If we run through to Edinburgh, we shall doubtless be
arrested or at least impeded. This train will stop at Dunbar for
one minute. Just before it leaves again, get out as quietly as you
can&mdash;at the last moment. I will also get out and join you. Let
Partab go on; it will excite less attention. The scheme I suggest
is the only safe plan. If you agree, as soon as we have well
started from Berwick, shake your handkerchief unobtrusively out of
your carriage window.'</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 217px;"><a name="ILL_071" id=
"ILL_071"></a> <img src="1302191h-images/ill_071.jpg" width="217"
height="500" alt="I BECKONED A PORTER." title=""> <span class=
"caption">I BECKONED A PORTER.</span></div>
<p>I beckoned a porter noiselessly without one word. The detective
was now strolling along the fore-part of the train, with his back
turned towards me, peering as he went into all the windows. I gave
the porter a shilling. 'Take this to a black gentleman in the next
carriage but one,' I said, in a<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> confidential whisper.
The porter touched his hat, nodded, smiled, and took it.</p>
<p>Would Harold see the necessity for acting on my advice?&mdash; I
wondered. I gazed out along the train as soon as we had got well
clear of Berwick. A minute&mdash;two minutes&mdash;three minutes
passed; and still no handkerchief. I began to despair. He was
debating, no doubt. If he refused, all was lost, and we were
disgraced for ever.</p>
<p>At last, after long waiting, as I stared still along the
whizzing line, with the smoke in my eyes, and the dust half
blinding me, I saw, to my intense relief, a handkerchief flutter.
It fluttered once, not markedly, then a black hand withdrew it.
Only just in time, for even as it disappeared, the detective's head
thrust itself out of a farther window. He was not looking for
anything in particular, as far as I could tell&mdash;just observing
the signals. But it gave me a strange thrill to think even now we
were so nearly defeated.</p>
<p>My next trouble was&mdash;would the train draw up at Dunbar? The
10 A.M. from King's Cross is not set down to stop there in
Bradshaw, for no passengers are booked to or from the station by
the day express; but I remembered from of old when I lived at
Edinburgh, that it used always to wait about a minute for some
engine-driver's purpose. This doubt filled me with fresh fear; did
it draw up there still?&mdash;they have accelerated the service so
much of late years, and abolished so many old accustomed stoppages.
I counted the familiar stations with my breath held back. They
seemed so much farther apart than usual. Reston&mdash;Grant's
House&mdash;Cockburnspath&mdash;Innerwick.</p>
<p>The next was Dunbar. If we rolled past <i>that</i>, then all was
lost. We could never get married. I trembled and hugged myself.</p>
<p>The engine screamed. Did that mean she was running<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
through? Oh, how I wished I had learned the interpretation of the
signals!</p>
<p>Then gradually, gently, we began to slow. Were we slowing to
pass the station only? No; with a jolt she drew up. My heart gave a
bound as I read the word 'Dunbar' on the station notice-board.</p>
<p>I rose and waited, with my fingers on the door. Happily it had
one of those new-fashioned slip-latches which open from inside. No
need to betray myself prematurely to the detective by a hand
displayed on the outer handle. I glanced out at him cautiously. His
head was thrust through his window, and his sloping shoulders
revealed the spy, but he was looking the other way&mdash;observing
the signals, doubtless, to discover why we stopped at a place not
mentioned in Bradshaw.</p>
<p>Harold's face just showed from another window close by. Too soon
or too late might either of them be fatal. He glanced inquiry at
me. I nodded back, 'Now!' The train gave its first jerk, a faint
backward jerk, indicative of the nascent intention of starting. As
it braced itself to go on, I jumped out; so did Harold. We faced
one another on the platform without a word. 'Stand away there:' the
station-master cried, in an angry voice. The guard waved his green
flag. The detective, still absorbed on the signals, never once
looked back. One second later, we were safe at Dunbar, and he was
speeding away by the express for Edinburgh.</p>
<p>It gave us a breathing space of about an hour.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;"><a name="ILL_072" id=

title=""> <span class="caption">YOU CAN&#39;T GET OUT HERE, HE
SAID, CRUSTILY.</span></div>
<p>For half a minute I could not speak. My heart was in my mouth. I
hardly even dared to look at Harold. Then the station-master
stalked up to us with a threatening manner. 'You can't get out
here,' he said, crustily, in a gruff Scotch voice. 'This train is
not timed to set down before Edinburgh.'<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>
<p>'We <i>have</i> got out,' I answered, taking it upon me to speak
for my fellow-culprit, the Hindu&mdash;as he was to all seeming.
'The logic of facts is with us. We were booked through to
Edinburgh, but we wanted to stop at Dunbar; and as the train
happened to pull up, we thought we needn't waste time by going on
all that way and then coming back again.'</p>
<p>'Ye should have changed at Berwick,' the station-master said,
still gruffly, 'and come on by the slow train.' I could<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span> see
his careful Scotch soul was vexed (incidentally) at our
extravagance in paying the extra fare to Edinburgh and back
again.</p>
<p>In spite of agitation, I managed to summon up one of my sweetest
smiles&mdash;a smile that ere now had melted the hearts of rickshaw
coolies and of French <i>douaniers</i>. He thawed before it
visibly. 'Time was important to us,' I said&mdash;oh, he guessed
not how important; 'and besides, you know, it is so good for the
company!'</p>
<p>'That's true,' he answered, mollified. He could not tilt against
the interests of the North British shareholders. 'But how about yer
luggage? It'll have gone on to Edinburgh, I'm thinking.'</p>
<p>'We <i>have</i> no luggage,' I answered boldly.</p>
<p>He stared at us both, puckered his brow a moment, and then burst
out laughing. 'Oh, ay, I see,' he answered, with a comic air of
amusement. 'Well, well, it's none of my business, no doubt, and I
will not interfere with ye; though why a lady like
you&mdash;&mdash;' He glanced curiously at Harold.</p>
<p>I saw he had guessed right, and thought it best to throw myself
unreservedly on his mercy. Time was indeed important. I glanced at
the station clock. It was not very far from the stroke of six, and
we must manage to get married before the detective could miss us at
Edinburgh, where he was due at 6.30.</p>
<p>So I smiled once more, that heart-softening smile. 'We have each
our own fancies,' I said blushing&mdash;and, indeed (such is the
pride of race among women), I felt myself blush in earnest at the
bare idea that I was marrying a black man, in spite of our good
Maharajah's kindness. 'He is a gentleman, and a man of education
and culture.' I thought that recommendation ought to tell with a
Scotchman. 'We are in sore straits now, but our case is a just one.
Can you tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id=
"Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span> me who in this place is most likely
to sympathise&mdash;most likely to marry us?'</p>
<p>He looked at me&mdash;and surrendered at discretion. 'I should
think anybody would marry ye who saw yer pretty face and heard yer
sweet voice,' he answered. 'But, perhaps, ye'd better present
yerself to Mr. Schoolcraft, the U.P. minister at Little Kirkton. He
was aye soft-hearted.'</p>
<p>'How far from here?' I asked.</p>
<p>'About two miles,' he answered.</p>
<p>'Can we get a trap?'</p>
<p>'Oh ay, there's machines always waiting at the
station.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="ILL_073" id=

height="421" alt="WE TOLD OUR TALE." title=""> <span class=
"caption">WE TOLD OUR TALE.</span></div>
<p>We interviewed a 'machine,' and drove out to Little Kirkton.
There, we told our tale in the fewest words possible to the
obliging and good-natured U.P. minister. He looked, as the
station-master had said, 'soft-hearted'; but he dashed our hopes to
the ground at once by telling us candidly that unless we had had
our residence in Scotland for twenty-one days immediately preceding
the marriage, it would not be legal. 'If you were Scotch,' he
added, 'I could go through the ceremony at once, of course; and
then you could apply to the sheriff to-night for leave to register
the marriage in proper form afterward: but as one of you is
English, and the other I judge'&mdash;he smiled and glanced towards
Harold&mdash;'an Indian-born subject of Her Majesty, it would be
impossible for me to do it: the ceremony would be invalid, under
Lord Brougham's Act, without previous residence.'</p>
<p>This was a terrible blow. I looked away appealingly. 'Harold,' I
cried in despair, 'do you think we could manage to hide ourselves
safely anywhere in Scotland for twenty-one days?'</p>
<p>His face fell. 'How could I escape notice? All the world is
hunting for me. And then the scandal! No matter where you
stopped&mdash;however far from me&mdash;no, Lois darling, I could
never expose you to it.'</p>
<p>The minister glanced from one to the other of us, puzzled.
'Harold?' he said, turning over the word on his tongue. 'Harold?
That doesn't sound like an Indian name, does it? And&mdash;&mdash;'
he hesitated, 'you speak wonderful English!'</p>
<p>I saw the safest plan was to make a clean breast of it. He
looked the sort of man one could trust on an emergency. 'You have
heard of the Ashurst will case?' I said, blurting it out
suddenly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg
300]</a></span></p>
<p>'I have seen something about it in the newspapers; yes. But it
did not interest me: I have not followed it.'</p>
<p>I told him the whole truth; the case against us&mdash;the facts
as we knew them. Then I added, slowly, 'This is Mr. Harold
Tillington, whom they accuse of forgery. Does he look like a
forger? I want to marry him before he is tried. It is the only way
by which I can prove my implicit trust in him. As soon as we are
married, he will give himself up at once to the police&mdash;if you
wish it, before your eyes. But married we must be. <i>Can't</i> you
manage it somehow?'</p>
<p>My pleading voice touched him. 'Harold Tillington?' he murmured.
'I know of his forebears. Lady Guinevere Tillington's son, is it
not? Then you must be Younger of Gledcliffe.' For Scotland is a
village: everyone in it seems to have heard of every other.'</p>
<p>'What does he mean?' I asked. 'Younger of Gledcliffe?' I
remembered now that the phrase had occurred in Mr. Ashurst's will,
though I never understood it.</p>
<p>'A Scotch fashion,' Harold answered. 'The heir to a laird is
called Younger of so-and-so. My father has a small estate of that
name in Dumfriesshire; a <i>very</i> small estate: I was born and
brought up there.'</p>
<p>'Then you are a Scotchman?' the minister asked.</p>
<p>'Yes,' Harold answered frankly: 'by remote descent. We are
trebly of the female line at Gledcliffe; still, I am no doubt more
or less Scotch by domicile.'</p>
<p>'Younger of Gledcliffe! Oh, yes, that ought certainly to be
quite sufficient for our purpose. Do you live there?'</p>
<p>'I have been living there lately. I always live there when I'm
in Britain. It is my only home. I belong to the diplomatic
service.'</p>
<p>'But then&mdash;the lady?'<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>
<p>'She is unmitigatedly English,' Harold admitted, in a gloomy
voice.</p>
<p>'Not quite,' I answered. 'I lived four years in Edinburgh. And I
spent my holidays there while I was at Girton. I keep my boxes
still at my old rooms in Maitland Street.'</p>
<p>'Oh, that will do,' the minister answered, quite relieved; for
it was clear that our anxiety and the touch of romance in our tale
had enlisted him in our favour. 'Indeed, now I come to think of it,
it suffices for the Act if one only of the parties is domiciled in
Scotland. And as Mr. Tillington lives habitually at Gledcliffe,
that settles the question. Still, I can do nothing save marry you
now by religious service in the presence of my servants&mdash;which
constitutes what we call an ecclesiastical marriage&mdash;it
becomes legal if afterwards registered; and then you must apply to
the sheriff for a warrant to register it. But I will do what I can;
later on, if you like, you can be re-married by the rites of your
own Church in England.'</p>
<p>'Are you quite sure our Scotch domicile is good enough in law?'
Harold asked, still doubtful.</p>
<p>'I can turn it up, if you wish. I have a legal handbook. Before
Lord Brougham's Act, no formalities were necessary. But the Act was
passed to prevent Gretna Green marriages. The usual phrase is that
such a marriage does not hold good unless one or other of the
parties either has had his or her usual residence in Scotland, or
else has lived there for twenty-one days immediately preceding the
date of the marriage. If you like, I will wait to consult the
authorities.'</p>
<p>'No, thank you,' I cried. 'There is no time to lose. Marry us
first, and look it up afterwards. "One or other" will do, it seems.
Mr. Tillington is Scotch enough, I am<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> sure; he has no
address in Britain but Gledcliffe: we will rest our claim upon
that. Even if the marriage turns out invalid, we only remain where
we were. This is a preliminary ceremony to prove good faith, and to
bind us to one another. We can satisfy the law, if need be, when we
return to England.'</p>
<p>The minister called in his wife and servants, and explained to
them briefly. He exhorted us and prayed. We gave our solemn consent
in legal form before two witnesses. Then he pronounced us duly
married. In a quarter of an hour more, we had made declaration to
that effect before the sheriff, the witnesses accompanying us, and
were formally affirmed to be man and wife before the law of Great
Britain. I asked if it would hold in England as well.</p>
<p>'You couldn't be firmer married,' the sheriff said, with
decision, 'by the Archbishop of Canterbury in Westminster
Abbey.'</p>
<p>Harold turned to the minister. 'Will you send for the police?'
he said, calmly. 'I wish to inform them that I am the man for whom
they are looking in the Ashurst will case.'</p>
<p>Our own cabman went to fetch them. It was a terrible moment. But
Harold sat in the sheriff's study and waited, as if nothing unusual
were happening. He talked freely but quietly. Never in my life had
I felt so proud of him.</p>
<p>At last the police came, much inflated with the dignity of so
great a capture, and took down our statement. 'Do you give yourself
in charge on a confession of forgery?' the superintendent asked, as
Harold ended.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 285px;"><a name="ILL_074" id=

height="500" alt="I HAVE FOUND A CLUE." title=""> <span class=
"caption">I HAVE FOUND A CLUE.</span></div>
<p>'Certainly not,' Harold answered. 'I have not committed forgery.
But I do not wish to skulk or hide myself. I understand a warrant
is out against me in London. I have come to Scotland, hurriedly,
for the sake of getting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id=
"Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span> married, not to escape apprehension.
I am here, openly, under my own name. I tell you the facts; 'tis
for you to decide; if you choose, you can arrest me.'</p>
<p>The superintendent conferred for some time in another room with
the sheriff. Then he returned to the study. 'Very well, sir,' he
said, in a respectful tone, 'I arrest you.'</p>
<p>So that was the beginning of our married life. More than ever, I
felt sure I could trust in Harold.</p>
<p>The police decided, after hearing by telegram from London, that
we must go up at once by the night express, which they stopped for
the purpose. They were forced to divide us. I took the
sleeping-car; Harold travelled with two constables in a ordinary
carriage. Strange to say, notwithstanding all this, so great was
our relief from the tension of our flight, that we both slept
soundly.</p>
<p>Next morning we arrived in London, Harold guarded.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span> The
police had arranged that the case should come up at Bow Street that
afternoon. It was not an ideal honeymoon, and yet, I was somehow
happy.</p>
<p>At King's Cross, they took him away from me. Still, I hardly
cried. All the way up in the train, whenever I was awake, an idea
had been haunting me&mdash;a possible clue to this trickery of Lord
Southminster's. Petty details cropped up and fell into their
places. I began to unravel it all now. I had an inkling of a plan
to set Harold right again.</p>
<p>The will we had proved&mdash;&mdash;but I must not
anticipate.</p>
<p>When we parted, Harold kissed me on the forehead, and murmured
rather sadly, 'Now, I suppose it's all up. Lois, I must go. These
rogues have been too much for us.'</p>
<p>'Not a bit of it,' I answered, new hope growing stronger and
stronger within me. 'I see a way out. I have found a clue. I
believe, dear Harold, the right will still be vindicated.'</p>
<p>And red-eyed as I was, I jumped into a hansom, and called to the
cabman to drive at once to Lady Georgina's.<span class=

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII</h2>
<h3>THE ADVENTURE OF THE UNPROFESSIONAL DETECTIVE</h3>
<p>'Is Lady Georgina at home?' The discreet man-servant in sober
black clothes eyed me suspiciously. 'No, miss,' he answered. 'That
is to say&mdash;no, ma'am. Her ladyship is still at Mr. Marmaduke
Ashurst's&mdash;the late Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst, I mean&mdash;in
Park Lane North. You know the number, ma'am?'</p>
<p>'Yes, I know it,' I replied, with a gasp; for this was indeed a
triumph. My one fear had been lest Lord Southminster should already
have taken possession&mdash;why, you will see hereafter; and it
relieved me to learn that Lady Georgina was still at hand to guard
my husband's interests. She had been living at the house,
practically, since her brother's death. I drove round with all
speed, and flung myself into my dear old lady's arms.</p>
<p>'Kiss me,' I cried, flushed. 'I am your niece!' But she knew it
already, for our movements had been fully reported by this time
(with picturesque additions) in the morning papers. Imagination,
ill-developed in the English race, seems to concentrate itself in
the lower order of journalists.</p>
<p>She kissed me on both cheeks with unwonted tenderness. 'Lois,'
she cried, with tears in her eyes, 'you're a brick!'<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> It
was not exactly poetical at such a moment, but from her it meant
more than much gushing phraseology.</p>
<p>'And you're here in possession!' I murmured.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="ILL_075" id=

<span class="caption">I&#39;VE HELD THE FORT BY MAIN
FORCE.</span></div>
<p>The Cantankerous Old Lady nodded. She was in her element, I must
admit. She dearly loved a row&mdash;above all, a family row; but to
be in the thick of a family row, and to feel herself in the right,
with the law against her&mdash;that was joy such as Lady Georgina
had seldom before experienced. 'Yes, dear,' she burst out volubly,
'I'm in possession, thank Heaven. And what's more, they won't oust
me without a legal process. I've been here, off and on, you know,
ever since poor dear Marmy died, looking after things for
Harold;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg
307]</a></span> and I shall look after them still, till Bertie
Southminster succeeds in ejecting me, which won't be easy. Oh, I've
held the fort by main force, I can tell you; held it like a Trojan.
Bertie's in a precious great hurry to move in, I can see; but I
won't allow him. He's been down here this morning, fatuously
blustering, and trying to carry the post by storm, with a couple of
policemen.'</p>
<p>'Policemen!' I cried. 'To turn you out?'</p>
<p>'Yes, my dear, policemen: but (the Lord be praised) I was too
much for him. There are legal formalities to fulfil yet; and I
won't budge an inch, Lois, not one inch, my dear, till he's
fulfilled every one of them. Mark my words, child, that boy's up to
some devilry.'</p>
<p>'He is,' I answered.</p>
<p>'Yes, he wouldn't be in such a rampaging hurry to get
in&mdash;being as lazy as he's empty-headed&mdash;takes after
Gwendoline in that&mdash;if he hadn't some excellent reason for
wishing to take possession: and depend upon it, the reason is that
he wants to get hold of something or other that's Harold's. But he
sha'n't if I can help it; and, thank my stars, I'm a dour woman to
reckon with. If he comes, he comes over my old bones, child. I've
been overhauling everything of Marmy's, I can tell you, to
checkmate the boy if I can; but I've found nothing yet, and till
I've satisfied myself on that point, I'll hold the fort still, if I
have to barricade that pasty-faced scoundrel of a nephew of mine
out by piling the furniture against the front door&mdash; I will,
as sure as my name's Georgina Fawley!'</p>
<p>'I know you will, dear,' I assented, kissing her, 'and so I
shall venture to leave you, while I go out to institute another
little enquiry.'</p>
<p>'What enquiry?'</p>
<p>I shook my head. 'It's only a surmise,' I said,
hesitating.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id=
"Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span> 'I'll tell you about it later. I've
had time to think while I've been coming back in the train, and
I've thought of many things. Mount guard till I return, and mind
you don't let Lord Southminster have access to anything.'</p>
<p>'I'll shoot him first, dear.' And I believe she meant it.</p>
<p>I drove on in the same cab to Harold's solicitor. There I laid
my fresh doubts at once before him. He rubbed his bony hands.
'You've hit it!' he cried, charmed. 'My dear madam, you've hit it!
I never did like that will. I never did like the signatures, the
witnesses, the look of it. But what<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> could I do? Mr.
Tillington propounded it. Of course it wasn't my business to go
dead against my own client.'</p>
<p>'Then you doubted Harold's honour, Mr. Hayes?' I cried,
flushing.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="ILL_076" id=
"ILL_076"></a> <img src="1302191h-images/ill_076.jpg" width="600"
height="489" alt="NEVER! HE ANSWERED. NEVER!" title="">
<span class="caption">NEVER! HE ANSWERED. NEVER!</span></div>
<p>'Never!' he answered. 'Never! I felt sure there must be some
mistake somewhere, but not any trickery on&mdash;your husband's
part. Now, <i>you</i> supply the right clue. We must look into
this, immediately.'</p>
<p>He hurried round with me at once in the same cab to the court.
The incriminated will had been 'impounded,' as they call it; but,
under certain restrictions, and subject to the closest
surveillance, I was allowed to examine it with my husband's
solicitor, before the eyes of the authorities. I looked at it long
with the naked eye and also with a small pocket lens. The paper, as
I had noted before, was the same kind of foolscap as that which I
had been in the habit of using at my office in Florence; and the
typewriting&mdash;was it mine? The longer I looked at it, the more
I doubted it.</p>
<p>After a careful examination I turned round to our solicitor.
'Mr. Hayes,' I said, firmly, having arrived at my conclusion, 'this
is <i>not</i> the document I type-wrote at Florence.'</p>
<p>'How do you know?' he asked. 'A different machine? Some small
peculiarity in the shape of the letters?'</p>
<p>'No, the rogue who typed this will was too cunning for that. He
didn't allow himself to be foiled by such a scholar's mate. It is
written with a Spread Eagle, the same sort of machine precisely as
my own. I know the type perfectly. But&mdash;&mdash;' I
hesitated.</p>
<p>'But what?'</p>
<p>'Well, it is difficult to explain. There is character in
typewriting, just as there is in handwriting, only, of course, not
quite so much of it. Every operator is liable to his<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> own
peculiar tricks and blunders. If I had some of my own typewritten
manuscript here to show you, I could soon make that evident.'</p>
<p>'I can easily believe it. Individuality runs through all we do,
however seemingly mechanical. But are the points of a sort that you
could make clear in court to the satisfaction of a jury?'</p>
<p>'I think so. Look here, for example. Certain letters get
habitually mixed up in typewriting; <i>c</i> and <i>v</i> stand
next one another on the keyboard of the machine, and the person who
typed this draft sometimes strikes a <i>c</i> instead of a
<i>v</i>, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. I never do that. The letters
I tend to confuse are <i>s</i> and <i>w</i>, or else <i>e</i> and
<i>r</i>, which also come very near one another in the arbitrary
arrangement. Besides, when I type-wrote the original of this will,
I made no errors at all; I took such very great pains about
it.'</p>
<p>'And this person did make errors?'</p>
<p>'Yes; struck the wrong letter first, and then corrected it often
by striking another rather hard on top of it. See, this was a
<i>v</i> to begin with, and he turned it into a <i>c</i>. Besides,
the hand that wrote this will is heavier than mine: it comes down
<i>thump</i>, <i>thump</i>, <i>thump</i>, while mine glides
lightly. And the hyphens are used with a space between them, and
the character of the punctuation is not exactly as I make it.'</p>
<p>'Still,' Mr. Hayes objected, 'we have nothing but your word. I'm
afraid, in such a case, we could never induce a jury to accept your
unsupported evidence.'</p>
<p>'I don't want them to accept it,' I answered. 'I am looking this
up for my own satisfaction. I want to know, first, who wrote this
will. And of one thing I am quite clear: it is <i>not</i> the
document I drew up for Mr. Ashurst. Just look at that <i>x</i>. The
<i>x</i> alone is conclusive. My typewriter had the upper
right-hand stroke of the small <i>x</i> badly<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
formed, or broken, while this one is perfect. I remember it well,
because I used always to improve all my lower-case <i>x</i>'s with
a pen when I re-read and corrected. I see their dodge clearly now.
It is a most diabolical conspiracy. Instead of forging a will in
Lord Southminster's favour, they have substituted a forgery for the
real will, and then managed to make my poor Harold prove it.'</p>
<p>'In that case, no doubt, they have destroyed the real one, the
original,' Mr. Hayes put in.</p>
<p>'I don't think so,' I answered, after a moment's deliberation.
'From what I know of Mr. Ashurst, I don't believe it is likely he
would have left his will about carelessly anywhere. He was a
secretive man, fond of mysteries and mystifications. He would be
sure to conceal it. Besides, Lady Georgina and Harold have been
taking care of everything in the house ever since he died.'</p>
<p>'But,' Mr. Hayes objected, 'the forger of this document,
supposing it to be forged, must have had access to the original,
since you say the terms of the two are identical; only the
signatures are forgeries. And if he saw and copied it, why might he
not also have destroyed it?'</p>
<p>A light flashed across me all at once. 'The forger <i>did</i>
see the original,' I cried, 'but not the fair copy. I have it all
now! I detect their trick! It comes back to me vividly! When I had
finished typing the copy at Florence from my first rough draft,
which I had taken down on the machine before Mr. Ashurst's eyes, I
remember now that I threw the original into the waste-paper basket.
It must have been there that evening when Higginson called and
asked for the will to take it back to Mr. Ashurst. He called for
it, no doubt, hoping to open the packet before he delivered it and
make a copy of the document for this very purpose. But I refused to
let him have it. Before he saw<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> me, however, he had
been left by himself for ten minutes in the office; for I remember
coming out to him and finding him there alone: and during that ten
minutes, being what he is, you may be sure he fished out the rough
draft and appropriated it!'</p>

<span class="caption">WE SHALL HAVE HIM IN OUR POWER.</span></div>
<p>'That is more than likely,' my solicitor nodded. 'You are
tracking him to his lair. We shall have him in our power.'</p>
<p>I grew more and more excited as the whole cunning plot
unravelled itself mentally step by step before me. 'He<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> must
then have gone to Lord Southminster,' I went on, 'and told him of
the legacy he expected from Mr. Ashurst. It was five hundred
pounds&mdash;a mere trifle to Higginson, who plays for thousands.
So he must have offered to arrange matters for Lord Southminster if
Southminster would consent to make good that sum and a great deal
more to him. That odious little cad told me himself on the
<i>Jumna</i> they were engaged in pulling off "a big <i>coup</i>"
between them. He thought then I would marry him, and that he would
so secure my connivance in his plans; but who would marry such a
piece of moist clay? Besides, I could never have taken anyone but
Harold.' Then another clue came home to me. 'Mr. Hayes,' I cried,
jumping at it, 'Higginson, who forged this will, never saw the real
document itself at all; he saw only the draft: for Mr. Ashurst
altered one word <i>viva voce</i> in the original at the last
moment, and I made a pencil note of it on my cuff at the time: and
see, it isn't here, though I inserted it in the final clean copy of
the will&mdash;the word 'especially.' It grows upon me more and
more each minute that the real instrument is hidden somewhere in
Mr. Ashurst's house&mdash;Harold's house&mdash;our house; and that
<i>because</i> it is there Lord Southminster is so indecently
anxious to oust his aunt and take instant possession.'</p>
<p>'In that case,' Mr. Hayes remarked, 'we had better go back to
Lady Georgina without one minute's delay, and, while she still
holds the house, institute a thorough search for it.'</p>
<p>No sooner said than done. We jumped again into our cab and
started. As we drove back, Mr. Hayes asked me where I thought we
were most likely to find it.</p>
<p>'In a secret drawer in Mr. Ashurst's desk,' I answered, by a
flash of instinct, without a second's hesitation.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>
<p>'How do you know there's a secret drawer?'</p>
<p>'I don't know it. I infer it from my general knowledge of Mr.
Ashurst's character. He loved secret drawers, ciphers, cryptograms,
mystery-mongering.'</p>
<p>'But it was in that desk that your husband found the forged
document,' the lawyer objected.</p>
<p>Once more I had a flash of inspiration or intuition. 'Because
White, Mr. Ashurst's valet, had it in readiness in his possession,'
I answered, 'and hid it there, in the most obvious and unconcealed
place he could find, as soon as the breath was out of his master's
body. I remember now Lord Southminster gave himself away to some
extent in that matter. The hateful little creature isn't really
clever enough, for all his cunning,&mdash;and with Higginson to
back him,&mdash;to mix himself up in such tricks as forgery. He
told me at Aden he had had a telegram from "Marmy's valet," to
report progress; and he received another, the night Mr. Ashurst
died, at Moozuffernuggar. Depend upon it, White was more or less in
this plot; Higginson left him the forged will when they started for
India; and, as soon as Mr. Ashurst died, White hid it where Harold
was bound to find it.'</p>
<p>'If so,' Mr. Hayes answered, 'that's well; we have something to
go upon. The more of them, the better. There is safety in
numbers&mdash;for the honest folk. I never knew three rogues hold
long together, especially when threatened with a criminal
prosecution. Their confederacy breaks down before the chance of
punishment. Each tries to screen himself by betraying the
others.'</p>
<p>'Higginson was the soul of this plot,' I went on. 'Of that you
may be sure. He's a wily old fox, but we'll run him to earth yet.
The more I think of it, the more I feel sure, from what I know of
Mr. Ashurst's character, he would<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> never have put that
will in so exposed a place as the one where Harold says he found
it.'</p>
<p>We drew up at the door of the disputed house just in time for
the siege. Mr. Hayes and I walked in. We found Lady Georgina face
to face with Lord Southminster. The opposing forces were still at
the stage of preliminaries of warfare.</p>
<p>'Look heah,' the pea-green young man was observing, in his
drawling voice, as we entered; 'it's no use your talking, deah
Georgey. This house is mine, and I won't have you meddling with
it.'</p>
<p>'This house is not yours, you odious little scamp,' his aunt
retorted, raising her shrill voice some notes higher than usual;
'and while I can hold a stick you shall not come inside it.'</p>
<p>'Very well, then; you drive me to hostilities, don't yah know.
I'm sorry to show disrespect to your gray hairs&mdash;if
any&mdash;but I shall be obliged to call in the police to eject
yah.'</p>
<p>'Call them in if you like,' I answered, interposing between
them. 'Go out and get them! Mr. Hayes, while he's gone, send for a
carpenter to break open the back of Mr. Ashurst's escritoire.'</p>
<p>'A carpentah?' he cried, turning several degrees whiter than his
pasty wont. 'What for? A carpentah?'</p>
<p>I spoke distinctly. 'Because we have reason to believe Mr.
Ashurst's real will is concealed in this house in a secret drawer,
and because the keys were in the possession of White, whom we
believe to be your accomplice in this shallow conspiracy.'</p>
<p>He gasped and looked alarmed. 'No, you don't,' he cried,
stepping briskly forward. 'You don't, I tell yah! Break open
Marmy's desk! Why, hang it all, it's my property.'<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>
<p>'We shall see about that after we've broken it open,' I answered
grimly. 'Here, this screw-driver will do. The back's not strong.
Now, your help, Mr. Hayes&mdash;one, two, three; we can prise it
apart between us.'</p>
<p>Lord Southminster rushed up and tried to prevent us. But Lady
Georgina, seizing both wrists, held him tight as in a vice with her
dear skinny old hands. He writhed and struggled all in vain: he
could not escape her. 'I've often spanked you, Bertie,' she cried,
'and if you attempt to interfere, I'll spank you again; that's the
long and the short of it!'</p>
<p>He broke from her and rushed out, to call the police, I believe,
and prevent our desecration of pooah Marmy's property.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 230px;"><a name="ILL_078" id=

"caption">VICTORY.</span></div>
<p>Inside the first shell were several locked drawers, and two or
three open ones, out of one of which Harold had fished the false
will. Instinct taught me somehow that the central drawer on the
left-hand side was the compartment behind which lay the secret
receptacle. I prised it apart and peered about inside it. Presently
I saw a slip-panel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id=
"Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> which I touched with one finger. The
pigeon-hole flew open and disclosed a narrow slit I clutched at
something&mdash;the will! Ho, victory! the will! I raised it aloft
with a wild shout. Not a doubt of it! The real, the genuine
document!</p>
<p>We turned it over and read it. It was my own fair copy, written
at Florence, and bearing all the small marks of authenticity about
it which I had pointed out to Mr. Hayes as wanting to the forged
and impounded document. Fortunately, Lady Georgina and four of the
servants had stood by throughout this scene, and had watched our
demeanour, as well as Lord Southminster's.</p>
<p>We turned next to the signatures. The principal one was clearly
Mr. Ashurst's&mdash; I knew it at once&mdash;his legible fat hand,
'Marmaduke Courtney Ashurst.' And then the witnesses? They fairly
took our breath away.</p>
<p>'Why, Higginson's sister isn't one of them at all,' Mr. Hayes
cried, astonished.</p>
<p>A flush of remorse came over me. I saw it all now. I had
misjudged that poor woman! She had the misfortune to be a rogue's
sister, but, as Harold had said, was herself a most respectable and
blameless person. Higginson must have forged her name to the
document; that was all; and she had naturally sworn that she never
signed it. He knew her honesty. It was a master-stroke of
rascality.</p>
<p>'The other one isn't here, either,' I exclaimed, growing more
puzzled. 'The waiter at the hotel! Why, that's another forgery!
Higginson must have waited till the man was safely dead, and then
used him similarly. It was all very clever. Now, who are these
people who really witnessed it?'</p>
<p>'The first one,' Mr. Hayes said, examining the handwriting, 'is
Sir Roger Bland, the Dorsetshire baronet: he's<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
dead, poor fellow; but he was at Florence at the time, and I can
answer for his signature. He was a client of mine, and died at
Mentone. The second is Captain Richards, of the Mounted Police:
he's living still, but he's away in South Africa.'</p>
<p>'Then they risked his turning up?'</p>
<p>'If they knew who the real witnesses were at all&mdash;which is
doubtful. You see, as you say, they may have seen the rough draft
only.'</p>
<p>'Higginson would know,' I answered. 'He was with Mr. Ashurst at
Florence at the time, and he would take good care to keep a watch
upon his movements. In my belief, it was he who suggested this
whole plot to Lord Southminster.'</p>
<p>'Of course it was,' Lady Georgina put in. 'That's absolutely
certain. Bertie's a rogue as well as a fool: but he's too great a
fool to invent a clever roguery, and too great a knave not to join
in it foolishly when anybody else takes the pains to invent
it.'</p>
<p>'And it <i>was</i> a clever roguery,' Mr. Hayes interposed. 'An
ordinary rascal would have forged a later will in Lord
Southminster's favour and run the risk of detection; Higginson had
the acuteness to forge a will exactly like the real one, and to let
your husband bear the burden of the forgery. It was as sagacious as
it was ruthless.'</p>
<p>'The next point,' I said, 'will be for us to prove it.'</p>
<p>At that moment the bell rang, and one of the
house-servants&mdash;all puzzled by this conflict of
interests&mdash;came in with a telegram, which he handed me on a
salver. I broke it open, without glancing at the envelope. Its
contents baffled me: 'My address is Hotel Bristol, Paris; name as
usual. Send me a thousand pounds on account at once. I can't afford
to wait. No shillyshallying.'<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>
<p>The message was unsigned. For a moment, I couldn't imagine who
sent it, or what it was driving at.</p>
<p>Then I took up the envelope. 'Viscount Southminster, 24 Park
Lane North, London.'</p>
<p>My heart gave a jump. I saw in a second that chance, or
Providence, had delivered the conspirators into my hands that day.
The telegram was from Higginson! I had opened it by accident.</p>
<p>It was obvious what had happened. Lord Southminster must have
written to him on the result of the trial, and told him he meant to
take possession of his uncle's house immediately. Higginson had
acted on that hint, and addressed his telegram where he thought it
likely Lord Southminster would receive it earliest. I had opened it
in error, and that, too, was fortunate, for even in dealing with
such a pack of scoundrels, it would never have occurred to me to
violate somebody else's correspondence had I not thought it was
addressed to me. But having arrived at the truth thus
unintentionally, I had, of course, no scruples about making full
use of my information.</p>
<p>I showed the despatch at once to Lady Georgina and Mr. Hayes.
They recognised its importance. 'What next?' I inquired. 'Time
presses. At half-past three Harold comes up for examination at Bow
Street.'</p>
<p>Mr. Hayes was ready with an apt expedient. 'Ring the bell for
Mr. Ashurst's valet,' he said, quietly. 'The moment has now arrived
when we can begin to set these conspirators by the ears. As soon as
they learn that we know all, they will be eager to inform upon one
another.'</p>
<p>I rang the bell. 'Send up White,' I said. 'We wish to speak to
him.'</p>
<p>The valet stole up, self-accused, a timid, servile creature,
rubbing his hands nervously, and suspecting mischief.
He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg
320]</a></span> was a rat in trouble. He had thin brown hair,
neatly brushed and plastered down, so as to make it look still
thinner, and his face was the average narrow cunning face of the
dishonest man-servant. It had an ounce of wile in it to a pound or
two of servility. He seemed just the sort of rogue meanly to join
in an underhand conspiracy, and then meanly to back out of it. You
could read at a glance that his principle in life was to save his
own bacon.</p>

<span class="caption">YOU WISHED TO SEE ME, SIR?</span></div>
<p>He advanced, fumbling his hands all the time, and<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
smiling and fawning. 'You wished to see me, sir?' he murmured, in a
deprecatory voice, looking sideways at Lady Georgina and me, but
addressing the lawyer.</p>
<p>'Yes, White, I wished to see you. I have a question to ask you.
<i>Who</i> put the forged will in Mr. Ashurst's desk? Was it you,
or some other person?'</p>
<p>The question terrified him. He changed colour and gasped. But he
rubbed his hands harder than ever and affected a sickly smile. 'Oh,
sir, how should <i>I</i> know, sir? <i>I</i> had nothing to do with
it. I suppose&mdash;it was Mr. Tillington.'</p>
<p>Our lawyer pounced upon him like a hawk on a titmouse. 'Don't
prevaricate with me, sir,' he said, sternly. 'If you do, it may be
worse for you. This case has assumed quite another aspect. It is
you and your associates who will be placed in the dock, not Mr.
Tillington. You had better speak the truth; it is your one chance,
I warn you. Lie to me, and instead of calling you as a witness for
our case, I shall include you in the indictment.'</p>
<p>White looked down uneasily at his shoes, and cowered. 'Oh, sir,
I don't understand you.'</p>
<p>'Yes you do. You understand me, and you know I mean it.
Wriggling is useless; we intend to prosecute. We have unravelled
this vile plot. We know the whole truth. Higginson and Lord
Southminster forged a will between them&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Oh, sir, <i>not</i> Lord Southminster! His lordship, I'm
sure&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>Mr. Hayes's keen eye had noted the subtle shade of distinction
and admission. But he said nothing openly. 'Well, then, Higginson
forged, and Lord Southminster accepted, a false will, which
purported to be Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst's. Now, follow me clearly.
That will could not have been put<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> into the escritoire
during Mr. Ashurst's life, for there would have been risk of his
discovering it. It must, therefore, have been put there afterward.
The moment he was dead, you, or somebody else with your consent and
connivance, slipped it into the escritoire; and you afterwards
showed Mr. Tillington the place where you had set it or seen it
set, leading him to believe it was Mr. Ashurst's will, and so
involved him in all this trouble. Note that that was a felonious
act. We accuse you of felony. Do you mean to confess, and give
evidence on our behalf, or will you force me to send for a
policeman to arrest you?'</p>
<p>The cur hesitated still. 'Oh, sir,' drawing back, and fumbling
his hands on his breast, 'you don't mean it.'</p>
<p>Mr. Hayes was prompt. 'Hesslegrave, go for a policeman.'</p>
<p>That curt sentence brought the rogue on his marrow-bones at
once. He clasped his hands and debated inwardly. 'If I tell you all
I know,' he said, at last, looking about him with an air of abject
terror, as if he thought Lord Southminster or Higginson would hear
him, 'will you promise not to prosecute me?' His tone became
insinuating. 'For a hundred pounds, I could find the real will for
you. You'd better close with me. To-day is the last chance. As soon
as his lordship comes in, he'll hunt it up and destroy it.'</p>
<p>I flourished it before him, and pointed with one hand to the
broken desk, which he had not yet observed in his craven
agitation.</p>
<p>'We do not need your aid,' I answered. 'We have found the will,
ourselves. Thanks to Lady Georgina, it is safe till this
minute.'</p>
<p>'And to me,' he put in, cringing, and trying after his kind, to
curry favour with the winners at the last moment. 'It's all
<i>my</i> doing, my lady! I wouldn't destroy it. His<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
lordship offered me a hundred pounds more to break open the back of
the desk at night, while your ladyship was asleep, and burn the
thing quietly. But I told him he might do his own dirty work if he
wanted it done. It wasn't good enough while your ladyship was here
in possession. Besides, I wanted the right will preserved, for I
thought things might turn up so; and I wouldn't stand by and see a
gentleman like Mr. Tillington, as has always behaved well to me,
deprived of his inheritance.'</p>
<p>'Which is why you conspired with Lord Southminster to rob him of
it, and to send him to prison for Higginson's crime,' I interposed
calmly.</p>
<p>'Then you confess you put the forged will there?' Mr. Hayes
said, getting to business.</p>
<p>White looked about him helplessly. He missed his headpiece, the
instigator of the plot. 'Well, it was like this, my lady,' he
began, turning to Lady Georgina, and wriggling to gain time. 'You
see, his lordship and Mr. Higginson&mdash;&mdash;' he twirled his
thumbs and tried to invent something plausible.</p>
<p>Lady Georgina swooped. 'No rigmarole!' she said, sharply. 'Do
you confess you put it there or do you not&mdash;reptile?' Her
vehemence startled him.</p>
<p>'Yes, I confess I put it there,' he said at last, blinking. 'As
soon as the breath was out of Mr. Ashurst's body I put it there.'
He began to whimper. 'I'm a poor man with a wife and family, sir,'
he went on, 'though in Mr. Ashurst's time I always kep' that quiet;
and his lordship offered to pay me well for the job; and when
you're paid well for a job yourself, sir&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>Mr. Hayes waved him off with one imperious hand. 'Sit down in
the corner there, man, and don't move or utter another word,' he
said, sternly, 'until I order<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> you. You will be in
time still for me to produce at Bow Street.'</p>
<p>Just at that moment, Lord Southminster swaggered back,
accompanied by a couple of unwilling policemen. 'Oh, I say,' he
cried, bursting in and staring around him, jubilant. 'Look heah,
Georgey, <i>are</i> you going quietly, or must I ask these coppahs
to evict you?' He was wreathed in smiles now, and had evidently
been fortifying himself with brandies and soda.</p>
<p>Lady Georgina rose in her wrath. 'Yes, I'll go if you wish it,
Bertie,' she answered, with calm irony. 'I'll leave the house as
soon as you like&mdash;for the present&mdash;till we come back
again with Harold and <i>his</i> policemen to evict you. This house
is Harold's. Your game is played, boy.' She spoke slowly. 'We have
found the other will&mdash;we have discovered Higginson's present
address in Paris&mdash;and we know from White how he and you
arranged this little conspiracy.'</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;"><a name="ILL_080" id=

height="432" alt="WELL, THIS IS A FAIR KNOCK-OUT, HE EJACULATED."
title=""> <span class="caption">WELL, THIS IS A FAIR KNOCK-OUT, HE
EJACULATED.</span></div>
<p>She rapped out each clause in this last accusing sentence with
deliberate effect, like so many pistol-shots. Each bullet hit home.
The pea-green young man, drawing back and staring, stroked his
shadowy moustache with feeble fingers in undisguised astonishment.
Then he dropped into a chair and fixed his gaze blankly on Lady
Georgina. 'Well, this is a fair knock-out,' he ejaculated,
fatuously disconcerted. 'I wish Higginson was heah. I really don't
quite know what to do without him. That fellah had squared it all
up so neatly, don't yah know, that I thought there couldn't be any
sort of hitch in the proceedings.'</p>
<p>'You reckoned without Lois,' Lady Georgina said, calmly.</p>
<p>'Ah, Miss Cayley&mdash;that's true. I mean, Mrs. Tillington.
Yaas, yaas, I know, she's a doosid clevah person&mdash;for a
woman,&mdash;now isn't she?'<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>
<p>It was impossible to take this flabby creature seriously, even
as a criminal. Lady Georgina's lips relaxed. 'Doosid clever,' she
admitted, looking at me almost tenderly.</p>
<p>'But not quite so clevah, don't yah know, as Higginson!'</p>
<p>'There you make your blooming little erraw,' Mr. Hayes burst in,
adopting one of Lord Southminster's favourite witticisms&mdash;the
sort of witticism that improves, like poetry, by frequent
repetition. 'Policemen, you may go into the next room and wait:
this is a family affair; we have no immediate need of you.'</p>
<p>'Oh, certainly,' Lord Southminster echoed, much relieved. 'Very
propah sentiment! Most undesirable that the constables should mix
themselves up in a family mattah like this. Not the place for
inferiahs!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id=
"Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>
<p>'Then why introduce them?' Lady Georgina burst out, turning on
him.</p>
<p>He smiled his fatuous smile. 'That's just what I say,' he
answered. 'Why the jooce introduce them? But don't snap my head
off!'</p>
<p>The policemen withdrew respectfully, glad to be relieved of this
unpleasant business, where they could gain no credit, and might
possibly involve themselves in a charge of assault. Lord
Southminster rose with a benevolent grin, and looked about him
pleasantly. The brandies and soda had endowed him with
irrepressible cheerfulness.</p>
<p>'Well?' Lady Georgina murmured.</p>
<p>'Well, I think I'll leave now, Georgey. You've trumped my ace,
yah know. Nasty trick of White to go and round on a fellah. I don't
like the turn this business is taking. Seems to me, the only way I
have left to get out of it is&mdash;to turn Queen's evidence.'</p>
<p>Lady Georgina planted herself firmly against the door. 'Bertie,'
she cried, 'no, you don't&mdash;not till we've got what we want out
of you!'</p>
<p>He gazed at her blandly. His face broke once more into an
imbecile smile. 'You were always a rough 'un, Georgey. Your hand
did sting! Well, what do you want now? We've each played our cards,
and you needn't cut up rusty over it&mdash;especially when you're
winning! Hang it all, I wish I had Higginson heah to tackle
you!'</p>
<p>'If you go to see the Treasury people, or the Solicitor-General,
or the Public Prosecutor, or whoever else it may be,' Lady Georgina
said, stoutly, 'Mr. Hayes must go with you. We've trumped your ace,
as you say, and we mean to take advantage of it. And then you must
trundle yourself down to Bow Street afterwards, confess the whole
truth, and set Harold at liberty.'<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>
<p>'Oh, I say now, Georgey! The whole truth! the whole blooming
truth! That's really what I call humiliating a fellah!'</p>
<p>'If you don't, we arrest you this minute&mdash;fourteen years'
imprisonment!'</p>
<p>'Fourteen yeahs?' He wiped his forehead. 'Oh, I say. How doosid
uncomfortable. I was nevah much good at doing anything by the sweat
of my brow. I ought to have lived in the Garden of Eden. Georgey,
you're hard on a chap when he's down on his luck. It would be
confounded cruel to send me to fourteen yeahs at Portland.'</p>
<p>'You would have sent my husband to it,' I broke in, angrily,
confronting him.</p>
<p>'What? You too, Miss Cayley?&mdash; I mean Mrs. Tillington.
Don't look at me like that. Tigahs aren't in it.'</p>
<p>His jauntiness disarmed us. However wicked he might be, one felt
it would be ridiculous to imprison this schoolboy. A sound flogging
and a month's deprivation of wine and cigarettes was the obvious
punishment designed for him by nature.</p>
<p>'You must go down to the police-court and confess this whole
conspiracy,' Lady Georgina went on after a pause, as sternly as she
was able. 'I prefer, if we can, to save the family&mdash;even you,
Bertie. But I can't any longer save the family honour&mdash; I can
only save Harold's. You must help me to do that; and then, you must
give me your solemn promise&mdash;in writing&mdash;to leave England
for ever, and go to live in South Africa.'</p>
<p>He stroked the invisible moustache more nervously than before.
That penalty came home to him. 'What, leave England for evah?
Newmarket&mdash;Ascot&mdash;the club&mdash;the music-halls!'</p>
<p>'Or fourteen years' imprisonment!'<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>
<p>'Georgey, you spank as hard as evah!'</p>
<p>'Decide at once, or we arrest you!'</p>
<p>He glanced about him feebly. I could see he was longing for his
lost confederate. 'Well, I'll go,' he said at last, sobering down;
'and your solicitaw can trot round with me. I'll do all that you
wish, though I call it most unfriendly. Hang it all, fourteen yeahs
would be so beastly unpleasant!'</p>
<p>We drove forthwith to the proper authorities, who, on hearing
the facts, at once arranged to accept Lord Southminster and White
as Queen's evidence, neither being the actual forger. We also
telegraphed to Paris to have Higginson arrested, Lord Southminster
giving us up his assumed name with the utmost cheerfulness, and
without one moment's compunction. Mr. Hayes was quite right: each
conspirator was only too ready to save himself by betraying his
fellows. Then we drove on to Bow Street (Lord Southminster
consoling himself with a cigarette on the way), just in time for
Harold's case, which was to be taken, by special arrangement, at
3.30.</p>
<p>A very few minutes sufficed to turn the tables completely on the
conspirators. Harold was discharged, and a warrant was issued for
the arrest of Higginson, the actual forger. He had drawn up the
false will and signed it with Mr. Ashurst's name, after which he
had presented it for Lord Southminster's approval. The pea-green
young man told his tale with engaging frankness. 'Bertie's a simple
Simon,' Lady Georgina commented to me; 'but he's also a rogue; and
Higginson saw his way to make excellent capital of him in both
capacities&mdash;first use him as a catspaw, and then blackmail
him.'</p>

Southminster met us&mdash;still radiant as ever. He<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
seemed wholly unaware of the depths of his iniquity: a fresh dose
of brandy had restored his composure. 'Look heah,' he said,
'Harold, your wife has bested me! Jolly good thing for you that you
managed to get hold of such a clevah woman! If you hadn't, deah
boy, you'd have found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id=
"Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> yourself in Queeah Street! But, I
say, Lois&mdash; I call yah Lois because you're my cousin now, yah
know&mdash;you were backing the wrong man aftah all, as I told yah.
For if you'd backed <i>me</i>, all this wouldn't have come out;
you'd have got the tin and been a countess as well, aftah the
governah's dead and gone, don't yah see. You'd have landed the
double event. So you'd have pulled off a bettah thing for yourself
in the end, as I said, if you'd laid your bottom dollah on me for
winnah!'</p>
<p>Higginson is now doing fourteen years at Portland; Harold and I
are happy in the sweetest place in Gloucestershire; and Lord
Southminster, blissfully unaware of the contempt with which the
rest of the world regards him, is shooting big game among his
'boys' in South Africa. Indeed, he bears so little malice that he
sent us a present of a trophy of horns for our hall last
winter.</p>

<h2>THE WINCHESTER EDITION</h2>
<h2>OF THE NOVELS OF</h2>
<h2>JANE AUSTEN</h2>
<p class="center">10 Vols. Demy 8vo, Cloth, 5s. net each Vol.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The perfection of the edition rests entirely on the efforts of
printer, paper-maker, and binder, Messrs. T. and A. <span class=
"smcap">Constable</span> of Edinburgh being responsible for the
typography, while Mr. <span class="smcap">Laurence Housman</span>
has designed the cover.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;'>
<p><i>SPECTATOR</i>.&mdash;'The Winchester Edition has special
claims to gratitude through the delightful quality of its print and
paper. The print is of a generous design, and very black and clear,
and the paper, while untransparent, not so heavy but that the book
can be held comfortably in one hand. Altogether this promises to be
one of the most delightful reprints ever given to the public.'</p>
<p><i>ATHEN&AElig;UM</i>.&mdash;'An exceedingly handsome
edition.... This is decidedly a cheap edition as well as an
ornamental one.'</p>
<p><i>WESTMINSTER GAZETTE</i>.&mdash;'Mr. Grant Richards is to be
congratulated on the charming edition of Miss Austen's Novels,
which starts with <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> in two volumes.
Print, paper, and binding (green and gold, with a charming design)
are all that the most fastidious could desire. An edition of this
kind is really wanted, and comes at a moment when there is a
natural inclination to turn back to the pages of this delightful
writer. The younger generation is supposed not to read Miss Austen,
which, if true, is hardly creditable to its education and good
taste. But latterly there have been signs of a re-discovery, which
will be stimulated by the issue of these beautiful volumes.'</p>

<h3>Some Opinions of the Press.</h3>
<p><i>THE TIMES</i>.&mdash;'Such good work in the way of showing
students the right manner of approaching the history of a great
city.... The execution of the little volumes is, on the whole,
admirable.... These useful little volumes.'</p>
<p><i>THE GUARDIAN</i>.&mdash;From the point of view of really
intelligent sight-seeing, the two little volumes that have already
appeared are better than anything that we yet have; and if the
holiday-maker will only take them with him to Paris or Florence, he
will probably feel that he has learnt more of the real city than in
all his former visits.</p>
<p><i>THE SPECTATOR</i>.&mdash;'A visitor to Florence could hardly,
we imagine, do better than provide himself with this volume. A
great amount of matter&mdash;and good matter, too&mdash;is
compressed into a small space, for the book is light, and such as
can go into a pocket of moderate capacity. Mr. Grant Allen not only
guides his reader's judgment, but disposes of his time for him; he
must not only not do much at once, but must arrange his
sight-seeing in an economical and intelligent way.'</p>
<p><i>MORNING POST</i>.&mdash;'That much-abused class of people,
the tourists, have often been taunted with their ignorance and want
of culture, and the perfunctory manner in which they hurry through
and "do" the art galleries of Europe. There is a large amount of
truth, no doubt, in the charge, but they might very well retort on
their critics that no one had come forward to meet their wants, or
to assist in dispelling their ignorance. No doubt there are
guide-books, very excellent ones in their way, but on all matters
of art very little better than mere indices; something fuller was
required to enable the average man intelligently to appreciate the
treasures submitted to his views. Mr. Grant Allen has undertaken to
meet their wants, and offers these handbooks to the public at a
price which ought to be within the reach of every one who can
afford to travel at all. The idea is a good one, and should ensure
the success which Mr. Allen deserves.'</p>
