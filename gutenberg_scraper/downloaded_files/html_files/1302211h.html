<h3 align="center"><i>THE BLACK BAG LEFT ON A DOOR-STEP.</i></h3>
<p>"I<small>T'S</small> a big thing," said Loveday Brooke,
addressing Ebenezer Dyer, chief of the well-known detective agency
in Lynch Court, Fleet Street; "Lady Cathrow has lost £30,000 worth
of jewellery, if the newspaper accounts are to be trusted."</p>
<p>"They are fairly accurate this time. The robbery differs in few
respects from the usual run of country-house robberies. The time
chosen, of course, was the dinner-hour, when the family and guests
were at table and the servants not on duty were amusing themselves
in their own quarters. The fact of its being Christmas Eve would
also of necessity add to the business and consequent distraction of
the household. The entry to the house, however, in this case was
not effected in the usual manner by a ladder to the dressing-room
window, but through the window of a room on the ground
floor&mdash;a small room with one window and two doors, one of
which opens into the hall, and the other into a passage that leads
by the back stairs to the bedroom floor. It is used, I believe, as
a sort of hat and coat room by the gentlemen of the house."</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="184" height=
"265" src="1302211h-images/1.gif"><br>
WINDOW ON THE GROUND FLOOR.</p>
<p>"It was, I suppose, the weak point of the house?"</p>
<p>"Quite so. A very weak point indeed. Craigen Court, the
residence of Sir George and Lady Cathrow, is an oddly-built old
place, jutting out in all directions, and as this window looked out
upon a blank wall, it was filled in with stained glass, kept
fastened by a strong brass catch, and never opened, day or night,
ventilation being obtained by means of a glass ventilator fitted in
the upper panes. It seems absurd to think that this window, being
only about four feet from the ground, should have had neither iron
bars nor shutters added to it; such, however, was the case. On the
night of the robbery, someone within the house must have
deliberately, and of intention, unfastened its only protection, the
brass catch, and thus given the thieves easy entrance to the
house."</p>
<p>"Your suspicions, I suppose, centre upon the servants?"</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly; and it is in the servants' hall that your services
will be required. The thieves, whoever they were, were perfectly
cognizant of the ways of the house. Lady Cathrow's jewellery was
kept in a safe in her dressing-room, and as the dressing-room was
over the dining-room, Sir George was in the habit of saying that it
was the 'safest' room in the house. (Note the pun, please; Sir
George is rather proud of it.) By his orders the window of the
dining-room immediately under the dressing-room window was always
left unshuttered and without blind during dinner, and as a full
stream of light thus fell through it on to the outside terrace, it
would have been impossible for anyone to have placed a ladder there
unseen."</p>
<p>"I see from the newspapers that it was Sir George's invariable
custom to fill his house and give a large dinner on Christmas
Eve."</p>
<p>"Yes. Sir George and Lady Cathrow are elderly people, with no
family and few relatives, and have consequently a large amount of
time to spend on their friends."</p>
<p>"I suppose the key of the safe was frequently left in the
possession of Lady Cathrow's maid?"</p>
<p>"Yes. She is a young French girl, Stephanie Delcroix by name. It
was her duty to clear the dressing-room directly after her mistress
left it; put away any jewellery that might be lying about, lock the
safe, and keep the key till her mistress came up to bed. On the
night of the robbery, however, she admits that, instead of so
doing, directly her mistress left the dressing-room, she ran down
to the housekeeper's room to see if any letters had come for her,
and remained chatting with the other servants for some
time&mdash;she could not say for how long. It was by the
half-past-seven post that her letters generally arrived from St.
Omer, where her home is."</p>
<p>"Oh, then, she was in the habit of thus running down to enquire
for her letters, no doubt, and the thieves, who appear to be so
thoroughly cognizant of the house, would know this also."</p>
<p>"Perhaps; though at the present moment I must say things look
very black against the girl. Her manner, too, when questioned, is
not calculated to remove suspicion. She goes from one fit of
hysterics into another; contradicts herself nearly every time she
opens her mouth, then lays it to the charge of her ignorance of our
language; breaks into voluble French; becomes theatrical in action,
and then goes off into hysterics once more."</p>
<p>"All that is quite Fran?ais, you know," said Loveday. "Do the
authorities at Scotland Yard lay much stress on the safe being left
unlocked that night?"</p>
<p>"They do, and they are instituting a keen enquiry as to the
possible lovers the girl may have. For this purpose they have sent
Bates down to stay in the village and collect all the information
he can outside the house. But they want someone within the walls to
hob-nob with the maids generally, and to find out if she has taken
any of them into her confidence respecting her lovers. So they sent
to me to know if I would send down for this purpose one of the
shrewdest and most clear-headed of my female detectives. I, in my
turn, Miss Brooke, have sent for you&mdash;you may take it as a
compliment if you like. So please now get out your note-book, and
I'll give you sailing orders."</p>
<p>Loveday Brooke, at this period of her career, was a little over
thirty years of age, and could be best described in a series of
negations.</p>
<p>She was not tall, she was not short; she was not dark, she was
not fair; she was neither handsome nor ugly. Her features were
altogether nondescript; her one noticeable trait was a habit she
had, when absorbed in thought, of dropping her eyelids over her
eyes till only a line of eyeball showed, and she appeared to be
looking out at the world through a slit, instead of through a
window.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="225" height=
"268" src="1302211h-images/2.gif"><br>
A HABIT OF DROPPING HER EYELIDS.</p>
<p>Her dress was invariably black, and was almost Quaker-like in
its neat primness.</p>
<p>Some five or six years previously, by a jerk of Fortune's wheel,
Loveday had been thrown upon the world penniless and all but
friendless. Marketable accomplishments she had found she had none,
so she had forthwith defied convention, and had chosen for herself
a career that had cut her off sharply from her former associates
and her position in society. For five or six years she drudged away
patiently in the lower walks of her profession; then chance, or, to
speak more precisely, an intricate criminal case, threw her in the
way of the experienced head of the flourishing detective agency in
Lynch Court. He quickly enough found out the stuff she was made of,
and threw her in the way of better-class work&mdash;work, indeed,
that brought increase of pay and of reputation alike to him and to
Loveday.</p>
<p>Ebenezer Dyer was not, as a rule, given to enthusiasm; but he
would at times wax eloquent over Miss Brooke's qualifications for
the profession she had chosen.</p>
<p>"Too much of a lady, do you say?" he would say to anyone who
chanced to call in question those qualifications. "I don't care
twopence-halfpenny whether she is or is not a lady. I only know she
is the most sensible and practical woman I ever met. In the first
place, she has the faculty&mdash;so rare among women&mdash;of
carrying out orders to the very letter: in the second place, she
has a clear, shrewd brain, unhampered by any hard-and-fast
theories; thirdly, and most important item of all, she has so much
common sense that it amounts to genius&mdash;positively to genius,
sir."</p>
<p>But although Loveday and her chief as a rule, worked together
upon an easy and friendly footing, there were occasions on which
they were wont, so to speak, to snarl at each other.</p>
<p>Such an occasion was at hand now.</p>
<p>Loveday showed no disposition to take out her note-book and
receive her "sailing orders."</p>
<p>"I want to know," she said, "If what I saw in one newspaper is
true&mdash;that one of the thieves before leaving, took the trouble
to close the safe-door, and to write across it in chalk: 'To be
let, unfurnished'?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly true; but I do not see that stress need be laid on
the fact. The scoundrels often do that sort of thing out of
insolence or bravado. In that robbery at Reigate, the other day,
they went to a lady's Davenport, took a sheet of her note-paper,
and wrote their thanks on it for her kindness in not having had the
lock of her safe repaired. Now, if you will get out your
note-book&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Don't be in such a hurry," said Loveday calmly: "I want to know
if you have seen this?" She leaned across the writing-table at
which they sat, one either side, and handed to him a newspaper
cutting which she took from her letter-case.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="343" height=
"310" src="1302211h-images/3.gif"><br>
"HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?"</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer was a tall, powerfully-built man with a large head,
benevolent bald forehead and a genial smile. That smile, however,
often proved a trap to the unwary, for he owned a temper so
irritable that a child with a chance word might ruffle it.</p>
<p>The genial smile vanished as he took the newspaper cutting from
Loveday's hand.</p>
<p>"I would have you to remember, Miss Brooke," he said severely,
"that although I am in the habit of using dispatch in my business,
I am never known to be in a hurry; hurry in affairs I take to be
the especial mark of the slovenly and unpunctual."</p>
<p>Then, as if still further to give contradiction to her words, he
very deliberately unfolded her slip of newspaper and slowly,
accentuating each word and syllable, read as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center">"Singular Discovery.</p>
<p>"A black leather bag, or portmanteau, was found early yesterday
morning by one of Smith's newspaper boys on the doorstep of a house
in the road running between Easterbrook and Wreford, and inhabited
by an elderly spinster lady. The contents of the bag include a
clerical collar and necktie, a Church Service, a book of sermons, a
copy of the works of Virgil, a <i>facsimile</i> of Magna Charta,
with translations, a pair of black kid gloves, a brush and comb,
some newspapers, and several small articles suggesting clerical
ownership. On the top of the bag the following extraordinary
letter, written in pencil on a long slip of paper, was found:</p>
<p>'The fatal day has arrived. I can exist no longer. I go hence
and shall be no more seen. But I would have Coroner and Jury know
that I am a sane man, and a verdict of temporary insanity in my
case would be an error most gross after this intimation. I care not
if it is <i>felo de se</i>, as I shall have passed all suffering.
Search diligently for my poor lifeless body in the immediate
neighbourhood&mdash;on the cold heath, the rail, or the river by
yonder bridge&mdash;a few moments will decide how I shall depart.
If I had walked aright I might have been a power in the Church of
which I am now an unworthy member and priest; but the damnable sin
of gambling got hold on me, and betting has been my ruin, as it has
been the ruin of thousands who have preceded me. Young man, shun
the bookmaker and the race-course as you would shun the devil and
hell. Farewell, chums of Magdalen. Farewell, and take warning.
Though I can claim relationship with a Duke, a Marquess, and a
Bishop, and though I am the son of a noble woman, yet am I a tramp
and an outcast, verily and indeed. Sweet death, I greet thee. I
dare not sign my name. To one and all, farewell. O, my poor
Marchioness mother, a dying kiss to thee. R.I.P.'</p>
<p>"The police and some of the railway officials have made a
'diligent search' in the neighbourhood of the railway station, but
no 'poor lifeless body' has been found. The police authorities are
inclined to the belief that the letter is a hoax, though they are
still investigating the matter."</p>
<p>In the same deliberate fashion as he had opened and read the
cutting, Mr. Dyer folded and returned it to Loveday.</p>
<p>"May I ask," he said sarcastically, "what you see in that silly
hoax to waste your and my valuable time over?"</p>
<p>"I wanted to know," said Loveday, in the same level tones as
before, "if you saw anything in it that might in some way connect
this discovery with the robbery at Craigen Court?"</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer stared at her in utter, blank astonishment.</p>
<p>"When I was a boy," he said sarcastically as before, "I used to
play at a game called 'what is my thought like?' Someone would
think of something absurd&mdash;say the top of the
monument&mdash;and someone else would hazard a guess that his
thought might be&mdash;say the toe of his left boot, and that
unfortunate individual would have to show the connection between
the toe of his left boot and the top of the monument. Miss Brooke,
I have no wish to repeat the silly game this evening for your
benefit and mine."</p>
<p>"Oh, very well," said Loveday, calmly; "I fancied you might like
to talk it over, that was all. Give me my 'sailing orders,' as you
call them, and I'll endeavour to concentrate my attention on the
little French maid and her various lovers."</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer grew amiable again.</p>
<p>"That's the point on which I wish you to fix your thoughts," he
said; "you had better start for Craigen Court by the first train
to-morrow&mdash;it's about sixty miles down the Great Eastern line.
Huxwell is the station you must land at. There one of the grooms
from the Court will meet you, and drive you to the house. I have
arranged with the housekeeper there&mdash;Mrs. Williams, a very
worthy and discreet person&mdash;that you shall pass in the house
for a niece of hers, on a visit to recruit, after severe study in
order to pass board-school teachers' exams. Naturally you have
injured your eyes as well as your health with overwork; and so you
can wear your blue spectacles. Your name, by the way, will be Jane
Smith&mdash;better write it down. All your work will be among the
servants of the establishment, and there will be no necessity for
you to see either Sir George or Lady Cathrow&mdash;in fact, neither
of them have been apprised of your intended visit&mdash;the fewer
we take into our confidence the better. I've no doubt, however,
that Bates will hear from Scotland Yard that you are in the house,
and will make a point of seeing you."</p>
<p>"Has Bates unearthed anything of importance?"</p>
<p>"Not as yet. He has discovered one of the girl's lovers, a young
farmer of the name of Holt; but as he seems to be an honest,
respectable young fellow, and entirely above suspicion, the
discovery does not count for much."</p>
<p>"I think there's nothing else to ask," said Loveday, rising to
take her departure. "Of course, I'll telegraph, should need arise,
in our usual cipher."</p>
<p>The first train that left Bishopsgate for Huxwell on the
following morning included, among its passengers, Loveday Brooke,
dressed in the neat black supposed to be appropriate to servants of
the upper class. The only literature with which she had provided
herself in order to beguile the tedium of her journey was a small
volume bound in paper boards, and entitled, "The Reciter's
Treasury." It was published at the low price of one shilling, and
seemed specially designed to meet the requirements of third-rate
amateur reciters at penny readings.</p>
<p>Miss Brooke appeared to be all-absorbed in the contents of this
book during the first half of her journey. During the second, she
lay back in the carriage with closed eyes, and motionless as if
asleep or lost in deep thought.</p>
<p>The stopping of the train at Huxwell aroused her, and set her
collecting together her wraps.</p>
<p>It was easy to single out the trim groom from Craigen Court from
among the country loafers on the platform. Someone else beside the
trim groom at the same moment caught her eye&mdash;Bates, from
Scotland Yard, got up in the style of a commercial traveler, and
carrying the orthodox "commercial bag" in his hand. He was a small,
wiry man, with red hair and whiskers, and an eager, hungry
expression of countenance.</p>
<p>"I am half-frozen with cold," said Loveday, addressing Sir
George's groom; "if you'll kindly take charge of my portmanteau,
I'd prefer walking to driving to the Court."</p>
<p>The man gave her a few directions as to the road she was to
follow, and then drove off with her box, leaving her free to
indulge Mr. Bate's evident wish for a walk and confidential talk
along the country road.</p>
<p>Bates seemed to be in a happy frame of mind that morning.</p>
<p>"Quite a simple affair, this, Miss Brooke," he said: "a walk
over the course, I take it, with you working inside the castle
walls and I unearthing without. No complications as yet have
arisen, and if that girl does not find herself in jail before
another week is over her head, my name is not Jeremiah Bates."</p>
<p>"You mean the French maid?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes, of course. I take it there's little doubt but what
she performed the double duty of unlocking the safe and the window
too. You see I look at it this way, Miss Brooke: all girls have
lovers, I say to myself, but a pretty girl like that French maid,
is bound to have double the number of lovers than the plain ones.
Now, of course, the greater the number of lovers, the greater the
chance there is of a criminal being found among them. That's plain
as a pikestaff, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Just as plain."</p>
<p>Bates felt encouraged to proceed.</p>
<p>"Well, then, arguing on the same lines, I say to myself, this
girl is only a pretty, silly thing, not an accomplished criminal,
or she wouldn't have admitted leaving open the safe door; give her
rope enough and she'll hang herself. In a day or two, if we let her
alone, she'll be bolting off to join the fellow whose nest she has
helped to feather, and we shall catch the pair of them 'twixt here
and Dover Straits, and also possibly get a clue that will bring us
on the traces of their accomplices. Eh, Miss Brooke, that'll be a
thing worth doing?"</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly. Who is this coming along in this buggy at such a
good pace?"</p>
<p>The question was added as the sound of wheels behind them made
her look round.</p>
<p>Bates turned also. "Oh, this is young Holt; his father farms
land about a couple of miles from here. He is one of Stephanie's
lovers, and I should imagine about the best of the lot. But he does
not appear to be first favourite; from what I hear someone else
must have made the running on the sly. Ever since the robbery I'm
told the young woman has given him the cold shoulder."</p>
<p>As the young man came nearer in his buggy he slackened pace, and
Loveday could not but admire his frank, honest expression of
countenance,</p>
<p>"Room for one&mdash;can I give you a lift?" he said, as he came
alongside of them.</p>
<p>And to the ineffable disgust of Bates, who had counted upon at
least an hour's confidential talk with her, Miss Brooke accepted
the young farmer's offer, and mounted beside him in his buggy.</p>
<p>As they went swiftly along the country road, Loveday explained
to the young man that her destination was Craigen Court, and that
as she was a stranger to the place, she must trust to him to put
her down at the nearest point to it that he would pass.</p>
<p>At the mention of Craigen Court his face clouded.</p>
<p>"They're in trouble there, and their trouble has brought trouble
on others," he said a little bitterly.</p>
<p>"I know," said Loveday sympathetically; "it is often so. In such
circumstances as these suspicions frequently fastens on an entirely
innocent person."</p>
<p>"That's it! that's it!" he cried excitedly; "if you go into that
house you'll hear all sorts of wicked things said of her, and see
everything setting in dead against her. But she's innocent. I swear
to you she is as innocent as you or I are."</p>
<p>His voice rang out above the clatter of his horse's hoots. He
seemed to forget that he had mentioned no name, and that Loveday,
as a stranger, might be at a loss to know to whom he referred.</p>
<p>"Who is guilty Heaven only knows," he went on after a moment's
pause; "it isn't for me to give an ill name to anyone in that
house; but I only say she is innocent, and that I'll stake my life
on."</p>
<p>"She is a lucky girl to have found one to believe in her, and
trust her as you do," said Loveday, even more sympathetically than
before.</p>
<p>"Is she? I wish she'd take advantage of her luck, then," he
answered bitterly. "Most girls in her position would be glad to
have a man to stand by them through thick and thin. But not she!
Ever since the night of that accursed robbery she has refused to
see me&mdash;won't answer my letters&mdash;won't even send me a
message. And, great Heavens! I'd marry her to-morrow, if I had the
chance, and dare the world to say a word against her."</p>
<p>He whipped up his pony. The hedges seemed to fly on either side
of them, and before Loveday realized that half her drive was over,
he had drawn rein, and was helping her to alight at the servants'
entrance to Craigen Court.</p>
<p>"You'll tell her what I've said to you, if you get the
opportunity, and beg her to see me, if only for five minutes?" he
petitioned before he re-mounted his buggy. And Loveday, as she
thanked the young man for his kind attention, promised to make an
opportunity to give his message to the girl.</p>
<p>Mrs. Williams, the housekeeper, welcomed Loveday in the
servants' hall, and then took her to her own room to pull off her
wraps. Mrs. Williams was the widow of a London tradesman, and a
little beyond the average housekeeper in speech and manner.</p>
<p>She was a genial, pleasant woman, and readily entered into
conversation with Loveday. Tea was brought in, and each seemed to
feel at home with the other. Loveday in the course of this easy,
pleasant talk, elicited from her the whole history of the events of
the day of the robbery, the number and names of the guests who sat
down to dinner that night, together with some other apparently
trivial details.</p>
<p>The housekeeper made no attempt to disguise the painful position
in which she and every one of the servants of the house felt
themselves to be at the present moment.</p>
<p>"We are none of us at our ease with each other now," she said,
as she poured out hot tea for Loveday, and piled up a blazing fire.
"Everyone fancies that everyone else is suspecting him or her, and
trying to rake up past words or deeds to bring in as evidence. The
whole house seems under a cloud. And at this time of year, too;
just when everything as a rule is at its merriest!" and here she
gave a doleful glance to the big bunch of holly and mistletoe
hanging from the ceiling.</p>
<p>"I suppose you are generally very merry downstairs at Christmas
time?" said Loveday. "Servants' balls, theatricals, and all that
sort of thing?"</p>
<p>"I should think we were! When I think of this time last year and
the fun we all had, I can scarcely believe it is the same house.
Our ball always follows my lady's ball, and we have permission to
ask our friends to it, and we keep it up as late as ever we please.
We begin our evening with a concert and recitations in character,
then we have a supper and then we dance right on till morning; but
this year!"&mdash;she broke off, giving a long, melancholy shake of
her head that spoke volumes.</p>
<p>"I suppose," said Loveday, "some of your friends are very clever
as musicians or reciters?"</p>
<p>"Very clever indeed. Sir George and my lady are always present
during the early part of the evening, and I should like you to have
seen Sir George last year laughing fit to kill himself at Harry
Emmett dressed in prison dress with a bit of oakum in his hand,
reciting the "Noble Convict!" Sir George said if the young man had
gone on the stage, he would have been bound to make his
fortune."</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="166" height=
"346" src="1302211h-images/4.gif"><br>
RECITING THE "NOBLE CONVICT."</p>
<p>"Half a cup, please," said Loveday, presenting her cup. "Who was
this Harry Emmett then&mdash;a sweetheart of one of the maids?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he would flirt with them all, but he was sweetheart to
none. He was footman to Colonel James, who is a great friend of Sir
George's, and Harry was constantly backwards and forwards bringing
messages from his master. His father, I think, drove a cab in
London, and Harry for a time did so also; then he took it into his
head to be a gentleman's servant, and great satisfaction he gave as
such. He was always such a bright, handsome young fellow and so
full of fun, that everyone liked him. But I shall tire you with all
this; and you, of course, want to talk about something so
different;" and the housekeeper sighed again, as the thought of the
dreadful robbery entered her brain once more.</p>
<p>"Not at all. I am greatly interested in you and your
festivities. Is Emmett still in the neighbourhood? I should
amazingly like to hear him recite myself."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to say he left Colonel James about six months ago. We
all missed him very much at first. He was a good, kind-hearted
young man, and I remember he told me he was going away to look
after his dear old grandmother, who had a sweet-stuff shop
somewhere or other, but where I can't remember."</p>
<p>Loveday was leaning back in her chair now, with eyelids drooped
so low that she literally looked out through "slits" instead of
eyes.</p>
<p>Suddenly and abruptly she changed the conversation.</p>
<p>"When will it be convenient for me to see Lady Cathrow's
dressing-room?" she asked.</p>
<p>The housekeeper looked at her watch. "Now, at once," she
answered: "it's a quarter to five now and my lady sometimes goes up
to her room to rest for half an hour before she dresses for
dinner."</p>
<p>"Is Stephanie still in attendance on Lady Cathrow?" Miss Brooke
asked as she followed the housekeeper up the back stairs to the
bedroom floor.</p>
<p>"Yes, Sir George and my lady have been goodness itself to us
through this trying time, and they say we are all innocent till we
are proved guilty, and will have it that none of our duties are to
be in any way altered."</p>
<p>"Stephanie is scarcely fit to perform hers, I should
imagine?"</p>
<p>"Scarcely. She was in hysterics nearly from morning till night
for the first two or three days after the detectives came down, but
now she has grown sullen, eats nothing and never speaks a word to
any of us except when she is obliged. This is my lady's
dressing-room, walk in please."</p>
<p>Loveday entered a large, luxuriously furnished room, and
naturally made her way straight to the chief point of attraction in
it&mdash;the iron safe fitted into the wall that separated the
dressing-room from the bedroom.</p>
<p>It was a safe of the ordinary description, fitted with a strong
iron door and Chubb lock. And across this door was written with
chalk in characters that seemed defiant in their size and boldness,
the words: "To be let, unfurnished."</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="289" height=
"265" src="1302211h-images/5.gif"><br>
"TO BE LET, UNFURNISHED."</p>
<p>Loveday spent about five minutes in front of this safe, all her
attention concentrated upon the big, bold writing.</p>
<p>She took from her pocket-book a narrow strip of tracing-paper
and compared the writing on it, letter by letter, with that on the
safe door. This done she turned to Mrs. Williams and professed
herself ready to follow her to the room below.</p>
<p>Mrs. Williams looked surprised. Her opinion of Miss Brooke's
professional capabilities suffered considerable diminution.</p>
<p>"The gentlemen detectives," she said, "spent over an hour in
this room; they paced the floor, they measured the candles,
they&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Williams," interrupted Loveday, "I am quite ready to look
at the room below." Her manner had changed from gossiping
friendliness to that of the business woman hard at work at her
profession.</p>
<p>Without another word, Mrs. Williams led the way to the little
room which had proved itself to be the "weak point" of the
house.</p>
<p>They entered it by the door which opened into a passage leading
to the back-stairs of the house. Loveday found the room exactly
what it had been described to her by Mr. Dyer. It needed no second
glance at the window to see the ease with which anyone could open
it from the outside, and swing themselves into the room, when once
the brass catch had been unfastened.</p>
<p>Loveday wasted no time here. In fact, much to Mrs. Williams's
surprise and disappointment, she merely walked across the room, in
at one door and out at the opposite one, which opened into the
large inner hall of the house.</p>
<p>Here, however, she paused to ask a question:</p>
<p>"Is that chair always placed exactly in that position?" she
said, pointing to an oak chair that stood immediately outside the
room they had just quitted.</p>
<p>The housekeeper answered in the affirmative. It was a warm
corner. "My lady" was particular that everyone who came to the
house on messages should have a comfortable place to wait in.</p>
<p>"I shall be glad if you will show me to my room now," said
Loveday, a little abruptly; "and will you kindly send up to me a
county trade directory, if, that is, you have such a thing in the
house?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Williams, with an air of offended dignity, led the way to
the bedroom quarters once more. The worthy housekeeper felt as if
her own dignity had, in some sort, been injured by the want of
interest Miss Brooke had evinced in the rooms which, at the present
moment, she considered the "show" rooms of the house.</p>
<p>"Shall I send someone to help you unpack?" she asked, a little
stiffly, at the door of Loveday's room.</p>
<p>"No, thank you; there will not be much unpacking to do. I must
leave here by the first up-train to-morrow morning."</p>
<p>"To-morrow morning! Why, I have told everyone you will be here
at least a fortnight!"</p>
<p>"Ah, then you must explain that I have been suddenly summoned
home by telegram. I'm sure I can trust you to make excuses for me.
Do not, however, make them before supper-time. I shall like to sit
down to that meal with you. I suppose I shall see Stephanie
then?"</p>
<p>The housekeeper answered in the affirmative, and went her way,
wondering over the strange manners of the lady whom, at first, she
had been disposed to consider "such a nice, pleasant, conversable
person!"</p>
<p>At supper-time, however, when the upper-servants assembled at
what was, to them, the pleasantest meal of the day, a great
surprise was to greet them.</p>
<p>Stephanie did not take her usual place at table, and a
fellow-servant, sent to her room to summon her returned, saying
that the room was empty, and Stephanie was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Loveday and Mrs. Williams together went to the girl's bed-room.
It bore its usual appearance: no packing had been done in it, and,
beyond her hat and jacket, the girl appeared to have taken nothing
away with her.</p>
<p>On enquiry, it transpired that Stephanie had, as usual, assisted
Lady Cathrow to dress for dinner; but after that not a soul in the
house appeared to have seen her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Williams thought the matter of sufficient importance to be
at once reported to her master and mistress; and Sir George, in his
turn, promptly dispatched a messenger to Mr. Bates, at the "King's
Head," to summon him to an immediate consultation.</p>
<p>Loveday dispatched a messenger in another direction&mdash;to
young Mr. Holt, at his farm, giving him particulars of the girl's
disappearance.</p>
<p>Mr. Bates had a brief interview with Sir George in his study,
from which he emerged radiant. He made a point of seeing Loveday
before he left the Court, sending a special request to her that she
would speak to him for a minute in the outside drive.</p>
<p>Loveday put her hat on, and went out to him. She found him
almost dancing for glee.</p>
<p>"Told you so! told you so! Now, didn't I, Miss Brooke?" he
exclaimed. "We'll come upon her traces before morning, never fear.
I'm quite prepared. I knew what was in her mind all along. I said
to myself, when that girl bolts it will be after she has dressed my
lady for dinner&mdash;when she has two good clear hours all to
herself, and her absence from the house won't be noticed, and when,
without much difficulty, she can catch a train leaving Huxwell for
Wreford. Well, she'll get to Wreford safe enough; but from Wreford
she'll be followed every step of the way she goes. Only yesterday I
set a man on there&mdash;a keen fellow at this sort of
thing&mdash;and gave him full directions; and he'll hunt her down
to her hole properly. Taken nothing with her, do you say? What does
that matter? She thinks she'll find all she wants where she's
going&mdash;'the feathered nest' I spoke to you about this morning.
Ha! ha! Well, instead of stepping into it, as she fancies she will,
she'll walk straight into a detective's arms, and land her pal
there into the bargain. There'll be two of them netted before
another forty-eight hours are over our heads, or my name's not
Jeremiah Bates."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do now?" asked Loveday, as the man
finished his long speech.</p>
<p>"Now! I'm back to the "King's Head" to wait for a telegram from
my colleague at Wreford. Once he's got her in front of him he'll
give me instructions at what point to meet him. You see, Huxwell
being such an out-of-the-way place, and only one train leaving
between 7.30 and 10.15, makes us really positive that Wreford must
be the girl's destination and relieves my mind from all anxiety on
the matter."</p>
<p>"Does it?" answered Loveday gravely. "I can see another possible
destination for the girl&mdash;the stream that runs through the
wood we drove past this morning. Good night, Mr. Bates, it's cold
out here. Of course so soon as you have any news you'll send it up
to Sir George."</p>
<p>The household sat up late that night, but no news was received
of Stephanie from any quarter. Mr. Bates had impressed upon Sir
George the ill-advisability of setting up a hue and cry after the
girl that might possibly reach her ears and scare her from joining
the person whom he was pleased to designate as her "pal."</p>
<p>"We want to follow her silently, Sir George, silently as, the
shadow follows the man," he had said grandiloquently, "and then we
shall come upon the two, and I trust upon their booty also." Sir
George in his turn had impressed Mr. Bates's wishes upon his
household, and if it had not been for Loveday's message, dispatched
early in the evening to young Holt, not a soul outside the house
would have known of Stephanie's disappearance.</p>
<p>Loveday was stirring early the next morning, and the eight
o'clock train for Wreford numbered her among its passengers. Before
starting, she dispatched a telegram to her chief in Lynch Court. It
read rather oddly, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Cracker fired. Am just starting for Wreford. Will wire to you
from there. L. B."</p>
<p>Oddly though it might read, Mr. Dyer did not need to refer to
his cipher book to interpret it. "Cracker fired" was the easily
remembered equivalent for "clue found" in the detective phraseology
of the office.</p>
<p>"Well, she has been quick enough about it this time!" he
soliquised as he speculated in his own mind over what the purport
of the next telegram might be.</p>
<p>Half an hour later there came to him a constable from Scotland
Yard to tell him of Stephanie's disappearance and the conjectures
that were rife on the matter, and he then, not unnaturally, read
Loveday's telegram by the light of this information, and concluded
that the clue in her hands related to the discovery of Stephanie's
whereabouts as well as to that of her guilt.</p>
<p>A telegram received a little later on, however, was to turn this
theory upside down. It was, like the former one, worded in the
enigmatic language current in the Lynch Court establishment, but as
it was a lengthier and more intricate message, it sent Mr. Dyer at
once to his cipher book.</p>
<p>"Wonderful! She has cut them all out this time!" was Mr. Dyer's
exclamation as he read and interpreted the final word.</p>
<p>In another ten minutes he had given over his office to the
charge of his head clerk for the day, and was rattling along the
streets in a hansom in the direction of Bishopsgate Station.</p>
<p>There he was lucky enough to catch a train just starting for
Wreford.</p>
<p>"The event of the day," he muttered, as he settled himself
comfortably in a corner seat, "will be the return journey when she
tells me, bit by bit, how she has worked it all out."</p>
<p>It was not until close upon three o'clock in the afternoon that
he arrived at the old-fashioned market town of Wreford. It chanced
to be cattle-market day, and the station was crowded with drovers
and farmers. Outside the station Loveday was waiting for him, as
she had told him in her telegram that she would, in a
four-wheeler.</p>
<p>"It's all right," she said to him as he got in; "he can't get
away, even if he had an idea that we were after him. Two of the
local police are waiting outside the house door with a warrant for
his arrest, signed by a magistrate. I did not, however, see why the
Lynch Court office should not have the credit of the thing, and so
telegraphed to you to conduct the arrest."</p>
<p>They drove through the High Street to the outskirts of the town,
where the shops became intermixed with private houses let out in
offices. The cab pulled up outside one of these, and two policemen
in plain clothes came forward, and touched their hats to Mr.
Dyer.</p>
<p>"He's in there now, sir, doing his office work," said one of the
men pointing to a door, just within the entrance, on which was
printed in black letters, "The United Kingdom Cab-drivers'
Beneficent Association." "I hear however, that this is the last
time he will be found there, as a week ago he gave notice to
leave."</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="314" height=
"332" src="1302211h-images/6.gif"><br>
AN OLD GENTLEMAN WRITING.</p>
<p>As the man finished speaking, a man, evidently of the
cab-driving fraternity, came up the steps. He stared curiously at
the little group just within the entrance, and then chinking his
money in his hand, passed on to the office as if to pay his
subscription.</p>
<p>"Will you be good enough to tell Mr. Emmett in there," said Mr.
Dyer, addressing the man, "that a gentleman outside wishes to speak
with him."</p>
<p>The man nodded and passed into the office. As the door opened,
it disclosed to view an old gentleman seated at a desk apparently
writing receipts for money. A little in his rear at his right hand,
sat a young and decidedly good-looking man, at a table on which
were placed various little piles of silver and pence. The get-up of
this young man was gentleman-like, and his manner was affable and
pleasant as he responded, with a nod and a smile, to the
cab-driver's message.</p>
<p>"I sha'n't be a minute," he said to his colleague at the other
desk, as he rose and crossed the room towards the door.</p>
<p>But once outside that door it was closed firmly behind him, and
he found himself in the centre of three stalwart individuals, one
of whom informed him that he held in his hand a warrant for the
arrest of Harry Emmett on the charge of complicity in the Craigen
Court robbery, and that he had "better come along quietly, for
resistance would be useless."</p>
<p>Emmett seemed convinced of the latter fact. He grew deadly white
for a moment, then recovered himself.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="274" height=
"378" src="1302211h-images/7.gif"><br>
HE GREW DEADLY WHITE.</p>
<p>"Will someone have the kindness to fetch my hat and coat," he
said in a lofty manner. "I don't see why I should be made to catch
my death of cold because some other people have seen fit to make
asses of themselves."</p>
<p>His hat and coat were fetched, and he was handed into the cab
between the two officials.</p>
<p>"Let me give you a word of warning, young man," said Mr. Dyer,
closing the cab door and looking in for a moment through the window
at Emmett. "I don't suppose it's a punishable offence to leave a
black bag on an old maid's doorstep, but let me tell you, if it had
not been for that black bag you might have got clean off with your
spoil."</p>
<p>Emmett, the irrepressible, had his answer ready. He lifted his
hat ironically to Mr. Dyer; "You might have put it more neatly,
guv'nor," he said; "if I had been in your place I would have said:
'Young man, you are being justly punished for your misdeeds; you
have been taking off your fellow-creatures all your life long, and
now they are taking off you.'"</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer's duty that day did not end with the depositing of
Harry Emmett in the local jail. The search through Emmett's
lodgings and effects had to be made, and at this he was naturally
present. About a third of the lost jewellery was found there, and
from this it was consequently concluded that his accomplices in the
crime had considered that he had borne a third of the risk and of
the danger of it.</p>
<p>Letters and various memoranda discovered in the rooms,
eventually led to the detection of those accomplices, and although
Lady Cathrow was doomed to lose the greater part of her valuable
property, she had ultimately the satisfaction of knowing that each
one of the thieves received a sentence proportionate to his
crime.</p>
<p>It was not until close upon midnight that Mr. Dyer found himself
seated in the train, facing Miss Brooke, and had leisure to ask for
the links in the chain of reasoning that had led her in so
remarkable a manner to connect the finding of a black bag, with
insignificant contents, with an extensive robbery of valuable
jewellery.</p>
<p>Loveday explained the whole thing, easily, naturally, step by
step in her usual methodical manner.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="395" height=
"338" src="1302211h-images/9.gif"><br>
LOVEDAY EXPLAINED THE WHOLE THING.</p>
<p>"I read," she said, "as I dare say a great many other people
did, the account of the two things in the same newspaper, on the
same day, and I detected, as I dare say a great many other people
did not, a sense of fun in the principal actor in each incident. I
notice while all people are agreed as to the variety of motives
that instigate crime, very few allow sufficient margin for variety
of character in the criminal. We are apt to imagine that he stalks
about the world with a bundle of deadly motives under his arm, and
cannot picture him at his work with a twinkle in his eye and a keen
sense of fun, such as honest folk have sometimes when at work at
their calling."</p>
<p>Here Mr. Dyer gave a little grunt; it might have been either of
assent or dissent.</p>
<p>Loveday went on:</p>
<p>"Of course, the ludicrousness of the diction of the letter found
in the bag would be apparent to the most casual reader; to me the
high falutin sentences sounded in addition strangely familiar; I
had heard or read them somewhere I felt sure, although where I
could not at first remember. They rang in my ears, and it was not
altogether out of idle curiosity that I went to Scotland Yard to
see the bag and its contents, and to copy, with a slip of tracing
paper, a line or two of the letter. When I found that the
handwriting of this letter was not identical with that of the
translations found in the bag, I was confirmed in my impression
that the owner of the bag was not the writer of the letter; that
possibly the bag and its contents had been appropriated from some
railway station for some distinct purpose; and, that purpose
accomplished, the appropriator no longer wished to be burthened
with it, and disposed of it in the readiest fashion that suggested
itself. The letter, it seemed to me, had been begun with the
intention of throwing the police off the scent, but the
irrepressible spirit of fun that had induced the writer to deposit
his clerical adjuncts upon an old maid's doorstep had proved too
strong for him here, and had carried him away, and the letter that
was intended to be pathetic ended in being comic."</p>
<p>"Very ingenious, so far," murmured Mr. Dyer: "I've no doubt when
the contents of the bag are widely made known through
advertisements a claimant will come forward, and your theory be
found correct."</p>
<p>"When I returned from Scotland Yard," Loveday continued, "I
found your note, asking me to go round and see you respecting the
big jewel robbery. Before I did so I thought it best to read once
more the newspaper account of the case, so that I might be well up
in its details. When I came to the words that the thief had written
across the door of the safe, 'To be Let, Unfurnished,' they at once
connected themselves in my mind with the 'dying kiss to my
Marchioness Mother,' and the solemn warning against the race-course
and the book-maker, of the black-bag letter-writer. Then, all in a
flash, the whole thing became clear to me. Some two or three years
back my professional duties necessitated my frequent attendance at
certain low class penny-readings, given in the South London slums.
At these penny-readings young shop-assistants, and others of their
class, glad of an opportunity for exhibiting their accomplishments,
declaim with great vigour; and, as a rule, select pieces which
their very mixed audience might be supposed to appreciate. During
my attendance at these meetings, it seemed to me that one book of
selected readings was a great favourite among the reciters, and I
took the trouble to buy it. Here it is."</p>
<p>Here Loveday took from her cloak-pocket "The Reciter's
Treasury," and handed it to her companion.</p>
<p>"Now," she said, "if you will run your eye down the index column
you will find the titles of those pieces to which I wish to draw
your attention. The first is 'The Suicide's Farewell;' the second,
'The Noble Convict;' the third, 'To be Let, Unfurnished.'"</p>
<p>"By Jove! so it is!" ejaculated Mr. Dyer.</p>
<p>"In the first of these pieces, 'The Suicide's Farewell,' occur
the expressions with which the black-bag letter begins&mdash;'The
fatal day has arrived,' etc., the warnings against gambling, and
the allusions to the 'poor lifeless body.' In the second, 'The
Noble Convict,' occur the allusions to the aristocratic relations
and the dying kiss to the marchioness mother. The third piece, 'To
be Let, Unfurnished,' is a foolish little poem enough, although I
dare say it has often raised a laugh in a not too-discriminating
audience. It tells how a bachelor, calling at a house to enquire
after rooms to be let unfurnished, falls in love with the daughter
of the house, and offers her his heart, which, he says, is to be
let unfurnished. She declines his offer, and retorts that she
thinks his head must be to let unfurnished, too. With these three
pieces before me, it was not difficult to see a thread of
connection between the writer of the black-bag letter and the thief
who wrote across the empty safe at Craigen Court. Following this
thread, I unearthed the story of Harry Emmett&mdash;footman,
reciter, general lover and scamp. Subsequently I compared the
writing on my tracing paper with that on the safe-door, and,
allowing for the difference between a bit of chalk and a steel nib,
came to the conclusion that there could be but little doubt but
what both were written by the same hand. Before that, however, I
had obtained another, and what I consider the most important, link
in my chain of evidence&mdash;how Emmett brought his clerical dress
into use."</p>
<p>"Ah, how did you find out that now?" asked Mr. Dyer, leaning
forward with his elbows on his knees.</p>
<p>"In the course of conversation with Mrs. Williams, whom I found
to be a most communicative person, I elicited the names of the
guests who had sat down to dinner on Christmas Eve. They were all
people of undoubted respectability in the neighbourhood. Just
before dinner was announced, she said, a young clergyman had
presented himself at the front door, asking to speak with the
Rector of the parish. The Rector, it seems, always dines at Craigen
Court on Christmas Eve. The young clergyman's story was that he had
been told by a certain clergyman, whose name he mentioned, that a
curate was wanted in the parish, and he had traveled down from
London to offer his services. He had been, he said, to the Rectory
and had been told by the servants where the Rector was dining, and
fearing to lose his chance of the curacy, had followed him to the
Court. Now the Rector had been wanting a curate and had filled the
vacancy only the previous week; he was a little inclined to be
irate at this interruption to the evening's festivities, and told
the young man that he didn't want a curate. When, however, he saw
how disappointed the poor young fellow looked&mdash;I believe he
shed a tear or two&mdash;his heart softened; he told him to sit
down and rest in the hall before he attempted the walk back to the
station, and said he would ask Sir George to send him out a glass
of wine. the young man sat down in a chair immediately outside the
room by which the thieves entered. Now I need not tell you who that
young man was, nor suggest to your mind, I am sure, the idea that
while the servant went to fetch him his wine, or, indeed, so soon
as he saw the coast clear, he slipped into that little room and
pulled back the catch of the window that admitted his confederates,
who, no doubt, at that very moment were in hiding in the grounds.
The housekeeper did not know whether this meek young curate had a
black bag with him. Personally I have no doubt of the fact, nor
that it contained the cap, cuffs, collar, and outer garments of
Harry Emmett, which were most likely redonned before he returned to
his lodgings at Wreford, where I should say he repacked the bag
with its clerical contents, and wrote his serio-comic letter. This
bag, I suppose, he must have deposited in the very early morning,
before anyone was stirring, on the door-step of the house in the
Easterbrook Road."</p>

A YOUNG CLERGYMAN PRESENTED HIMSELF.</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer drew a long breath. In his heart was unmitigated
admiration for his colleague's skill, which seemed to him to fall
little short of inspiration. By-and-by, no doubt, he would sing her
praises to the first person who came along with a hearty good will;
he had not, however, the slightest intention of so singing them in
her own ears&mdash;excessive praise was apt to have a bad effect on
the rising practitioner.</p>
<p>So he contented himself with saying:</p>
<p>"Yes, very satisfactory. Now tell me how you hunted the fellow
down to his diggings?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that was mere ABC work," answered Loveday. "Mrs. Williams
told me he had left his place at Colonel James's about six months
previously, and had told her he was going to look after his dear
old grandmother, who kept a sweet stuff-shop; but where she could
not remember. Having heard that Emmett's father was a cab-driver,
my thoughts at once flew to the cabman's vernacular&mdash;you know
something of it, no doubt&mdash;in which their provident
association is designated by the phase, 'the dear old grandmother,'
and the office where they make and receive their payments is styled
'the sweet stuff-shop.'"</p>
<p>"Ha, ha, ha! And good Mrs. Williams took it all literally, no
doubt?"</p>
<p>"She did; and thought what a dear, kind-hearted fellow the young
man was. Naturally I supposed there would be a branch of the
association in the nearest market town, and a local trades'
directory confirmed my supposition that there was one at Wreford.
Bearing in mind where the black bag was found, it was not difficult
to believe that young Emmett, possibly through his father's
influence and his own prepossessing manners and appearance, had
attained to some position of trust in the Wreford branch. I must
confess I scarcely expected to find him as I did, on reaching the
place, installed as receiver of the weekly moneys. Of course, I
immediately put myself in communication with the police there, and
the rest I think you know."</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer's enthusiasm refused to be longer restrained.</p>
<p>"It's capital, from first to last," he cried; "you've surpassed
yourself this time!"</p>
<p>"The only thing that saddens me," said Loveday, "is the thought
of the possible fate of that poor little Stephanie."</p>
<p>Loveday's anxieties on Stephanie's behalf were, however, to be
put to flight before another twenty-four hours had passed. The
first post on the following morning brought a letter from Mrs.
Williams telling how the girl had been found before the night was
over, half dead with cold and fright, on the verge of the stream
running through Craigen Wood&mdash;"found too"&mdash;wrote the
housekeeper, "by the very person who ought to have found her, young
Holt, who was, and is so desperately in love with her. Thank
goodness! at the last moment her courage failed her, and instead of
throwing herself into the stream, she sank down, half-fainting,
beside it. Holt took her straight home to his mother, and there, at
the farm, she is now, being taken care of and petted generally by
everyone."</p>

FOUND ON THE VERGE OF THE STREAM.</p>
<hr width="15%" align="center">
<h3 align="center"><a name="II" id="II"><i>THE MURDER AT TROYTE'S
HILL.</i></a></h3>
<p>"G<small>RIFFITHS</small>, of the Newcastle Constabulary, has
the case in hand," said Mr. Dyer; "those Newcastle men are
keen-witted, shrewd fellows, and very jealous of outside
interference. They only sent to me under protest, as it were,
because they wanted your sharp wits at work inside the house."</p>
<p>"I suppose throughout I am to work with Griffiths, not with
you?" said Miss Brooke.</p>
<p>"Yes; when I have given you in outline the facts of the case, I
simply have nothing more to do with it, and you must depend on
Griffiths for any assistance of any sort that you may require."</p>
<p>Here, with a swing, Mr. Dyer opened his big ledger and turned
rapidly over its leaves till he came to the heading "Troyte's Hill"
and the date "September 6th."</p>
<p>"I'm all attention," said Loveday, leaning back in her chair in
the attitude of a listener.</p>
<p>"The murdered man," resumed Mr. Dyer, "is a certain Alexander
Henderson&mdash;usually known as old Sandy&mdash;lodge-keeper to
Mr. Craven, of Troyte's Hill, Cumberland. The lodge consists merely
of two rooms on the ground floor, a bedroom and a sitting-room;
these Sandy occupied alone, having neither kith nor kin of any
degree. On the morning of September 6th, some children going up to
the house with milk from the farm, noticed that Sandy's bed-room
window stood wide open. Curiosity prompted them to peep in; and
then, to their horror, they saw old Sandy, in his night-shirt,
lying dead on the floor, as if he had fallen backwards from the
window. They raised an alarm; and on examination, it was found that
death had ensued from a heavy blow on the temple, given either by a
strong fist or some blunt instrument. The room, on being entered,
presented a curious appearance. It was as if a herd of monkeys had
been turned into it and allowed to work their impish will. Not an
article of furniture remained in its place: the bed-clothes had
been rolled into a bundle and stuffed into the chimney; the
bedstead&mdash;a small iron one&mdash;lay on its side; the one
chair in the room stood on the top of the table; fender and
fire-irons lay across the washstand, whose basin was to be found in
a farther corner, holding bolster and pillow. The clock stood on
its head in the middle of the mantelpiece; and the small vases and
ornaments, which flanked it on either side, were walking, as it
were, in a straight line towards the door. The old man's clothes
had been rolled into a ball and thrown on the top of a high
cupboard in which he kept his savings and whatever valuables he
had. This cupboard, however, had not been meddled with, and its
contents remained intact, so it was evident that robbery was not
the motive for the crime. At the inquest, subsequently held, a
verdict of 'willful murder' against some person or persons unknown
was returned. The local police are diligently investigating the
affair, but, as yet, no arrests have been made. The opinion that at
present prevails in the neighbourhood is that the crime has been
perpetrated by some lunatic, escaped or otherwise and enquiries are
being made at the local asylums as to missing or lately released
inmates. Griffiths, however, tells me that his suspicions set in
another direction."</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="404" height=
"161" src="1302211h-images/11.gif"><br>
THEY SAW OLD SANDY LYING DEAD ON THE FLOOR.</p>
<p>"Did anything of importance transpire at the inquest?"</p>
<p>"Nothing specially important. Mr. Craven broke down in giving
his evidence when he alluded to the confidential relations that had
always subsisted between Sandy and himself, and spoke of the last
time that he had seen him alive. The evidence of the butler, and
one or two of the female servants, seems clear enough, and they let
fall something of a hint that Sandy was not altogether a favourite
among them, on account of the overbearing manner in which he used
his influence with his master. Young Mr. Craven, a youth of about
nineteen, home from Oxford for the long vacation, was not present
at the inquest; a doctor's certificate was put in stating that he
was suffering from typhoid fever, and could not leave his bed
without risk to his life. Now this young man is a thoroughly bad
sort, and as much a gentleman-blackleg as it is possible for such a
young fellow to be. It seems to Griffiths that there is something
suspicious about this illness of his. He came back from Oxford on
the verge of delirium tremens, pulled round from that, and then
suddenly, on the day after the murder, Mrs. Craven rings the bell,
announces that he has developed typhoid fever and orders a doctor
to be sent for."</p>
<p>"What sort of man is Mr. Craven senior?"</p>
<p>"He seems to be a quiet old fellow, a scholar and learned
philologist. Neither his neighbours nor his family see much of him;
he almost lives in his study, writing a treatise, in seven or eight
volumes, on comparative philology. He is not a rich man. Troyte's
Hill, though it carries position in the county, is not a paying
property, and Mr. Craven is unable to keep it up properly. I am
told he has had to cut down expenses in all directions in order to
send his son to college, and his daughter from first to last has
been entirely educated by her mother. Mr. Craven was originally
intended for the church, but for some reason or other, when his
college career came to an end, he did not present himself for
ordination&mdash;went out to Natal instead, where he obtained some
civil appointment and where he remained for about fifteen years.
Henderson was his servant during the latter portion of his Oxford
career, and must have been greatly respected by him, for although
the remuneration derived from his appointment at Natal was small,
he paid Sandy a regular yearly allowance out of it. When, about ten
years ago, he succeeded to Troyte's Hill, on the death of his elder
brother, and returned home with his family, Sandy was immediately
installed as lodge-keeper, and at so high a rate of pay that the
butler's wages were cut down to meet it."</p>
<p>"Ah, that wouldn't improve the butler's feelings towards him,"
ejaculated Loveday.</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer went on: "But, in spite of his high wages, he doesn't
appear to have troubled much about his duties as lodge-keeper, for
they were performed, as a rule, by the gardener's boy, while he
took his meals and passed his time at the house, and, speaking
generally, put his finger into every pie. You know the old adage
respecting the servant of twenty-one years' standing: 'Seven years
my servant, seven years my equal, seven years my master.' Well, it
appears to have held good in the case of Mr. Craven and Sandy. The
old gentleman, absorbed in his philological studies, evidently let
the reins slip through his fingers, and Sandy seems to have taken
easy possession of them. The servants frequently had to go to him
for orders, and he carried things, as a rule, with a high
hand."</p>
<p>"Did Mrs. Craven never have a word to say on the matter?"</p>
<p>"I've not heard much about her. She seems to be a quiet sort of
person. She is a Scotch missionary's daughter; perhaps she spends
her time working for the Cape mission and that sort of thing."</p>
<p>"And young Mr. Craven: did he knock under to Sandy's rule?"</p>
<p>"Ah, now you're hitting the bull's eye and we come to Griffiths'
theory. The young man and Sandy appear to have been at loggerheads
ever since the Cravens took possession of Troyte's Hill. As a
schoolboy Master Harry defied Sandy and threatened him with his
hunting-crop; and subsequently, as a young man, has used strenuous
endeavours to put the old servant in his place. On the day before
the murder, Griffiths says, there was a terrible scene between the
two, in which the young gentleman, in the presence of several
witnesses, made use of strong language and threatened the old man's
life. Now, Miss Brooke, I have told you all the circumstances of
the case so far as I know them. For fuller particulars I must refer
you to Griffiths. He, no doubt, will meet you at Grenfell&mdash;the
nearest station to Troyte's Hill, and tell you in what capacity he
has procured for you an entrance into the house. By-the-way, he has
wired to me this morning that he hopes you will be able to save the
Scotch express to-night."</p>
<p>Loveday expressed her readiness to comply with Mr. Griffiths'
wishes.</p>
<p>"I shall be glad," said Mr. Dyer, as he shook hands with her at
the office door, "to see you immediately on your return&mdash;that,
however, I suppose, will not be yet awhile. This promises, I fancy,
to be a longish affair?" This was said interrogatively.</p>
<p>"I haven't the least idea on the matter," answered Loveday. "I
start on my work without theory of any sort&mdash;in fact, I may
say, with my mind a perfect blank."</p>
<p>And anyone who had caught a glimpse of her blank, expressionless
features, as she said this, would have taken her at her word.</p>
<p>Grenfell, the nearest post-town to Troyte's Hill, is a fairly
busy, populous little town&mdash;looking south towards the black
country, and northwards to low, barren hills. Pre-eminent among
these stands Troyte's Hill, famed in the old days as a border keep,
and possibly at a still earlier date as a Druid stronghold.</p>
<p>At a small inn at Grenfell, dignified by the title of "The
Station Hotel," Mr. Griffiths, of the Newcastle constabulary, met
Loveday and still further initiated her into the mysteries of the
Troyte's Hill murder.</p>
<p>"A little of the first excitement has subsided," he said, after
preliminary greetings had been exchanged; "but still the wildest
rumours are flying about and repeated as solemnly as if they were
Gospel truths. My chief here and my colleagues generally adhere to
their first conviction, that the criminal is some suddenly crazed
tramp or else an escaped lunatic, and they are confident that
sooner or later we shall come upon his traces. Their theory is that
Sandy, hearing some strange noise at the Park Gates, put his head
out of the window to ascertain the cause and immediately had his
death blow dealt him; then they suppose that the lunatic scrambled
into the room through the window and exhausted his frenzy by
turning things generally upside down. They refuse altogether to
share my suspicions respecting young Mr. Craven."</p>
<p>Mr. Griffiths was a tall, thin-featured man, with iron-grey
hair, but so close to his head that it refused to do anything but
stand on end. This gave a somewhat comic expression to the upper
portion of his face and clashed oddly with the melancholy look that
his mouth habitually wore.</p>
<p>"I have made all smooth for you at Troyte's Hill," he presently
went on. "Mr. Craven is not wealthy enough to allow himself the
luxury of a family lawyer, so he occasionally employs the services
of Messrs. Wells and Sugden, lawyers in this place, and who, as it
happens, have, off and on, done a good deal of business for me. It
was through them I heard that Mr. Craven was anxious to secure the
assistance of an amanuensis. I immediately offered your services,
stating that you were a friend of mine, a lady of impoverished
means, who would gladly undertake the duties for the munificent sum
of a guinea a month, with board and lodging. The old gentleman at
once jumped at the offer, and is anxious for you to be at Troyte's
Hill at once."</p>
<p>Loveday expressed her satisfaction with the programme that Mr.
Griffiths had sketched for her, then she had a few questions to
ask.</p>
<p>"Tell me," she said, "what led you, in the first instance, to
suspect young Mr. Craven of the crime?"</p>
<p>"The footing on which he and Sandy stood towards each other, and
the terrible scene that occurred between them only the day before
the murder," answered Griffiths, promptly. "Nothing of this,
however, was elicited at the inquest, where a very fair face was
put on Sandy's relations with the whole of the Craven family. I
have subsequently unearthed a good deal respecting the private life
of Mr. Harry Craven, and, among other things, I have found out that
on the night of the murder he left the house shortly after ten
o'clock, and no one, so far as I have been able to ascertain, knows
at what hour he returned. Now I must draw your attention, Miss
Brooke, to the fact that at the inquest the medical evidence went
to prove that the murder had been committed between ten and eleven
at night."</p>
<p>"Do you surmise, then, that the murder was a planned thing on
the part of this young man?"</p>
<p>"I do. I believe that he wandered about the grounds until Sandy
shut himself in for the night, then aroused him by some outside
noise, and, when the old man looked out to ascertain the cause,
dealt him a blow with a bludgeon or loaded stick, that caused his
death."</p>
<p>"A cold-blooded crime that, for a boy of nineteen?"</p>
<p>"Yes. He's a good-looking, gentlemanly youngster, too, with
manners as mild as milk, but from all accounts is as full of
wickedness as an egg is full of meat. Now, to come to another
point&mdash;if, in connection with these ugly facts, you take into
consideration the suddenness of his illness, I think you'll admit
that it bears a suspicious appearance and might reasonably give
rise to the surmise that it was a plant on his part, in order to
get out of the inquest."</p>
<p>"Who is the doctor attending him?"</p>
<p>"A man called Waters; not much of a practitioner, from all
accounts, and no doubt he feels himself highly honoured in being
summoned to Troyte's Hill. The Cravens, it seems, have no family
doctor. Mrs. Craven, with her missionary experience, is half a
doctor herself, and never calls in one except in a serious
emergency."</p>
<p>"The certificate was in order, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly. And, as if to give colour to the gravity of the
case, Mrs. Craven sent a message down to the servants, that if any
of them were afraid of the infection they could at once go to their
homes. Several of the maids, I believe, took advantage of her
permission, and packed their boxes. Miss Craven, who is a delicate
girl, was sent away with her maid to stay with friends at
Newcastle, and Mrs. Craven isolated herself with her patient in one
of the disused wings of the house."</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="340" height=
"487" src="1302211h-images/12.gif"><br>
PRETTY MISS CRAVEN.</p>
<p>"Has anyone ascertained whether Miss Craven arrived at her
destination at Newcastle?"</p>
<p>Griffiths drew his brows together in thought.</p>
<p>"I did not see any necessity for such a thing," he answered. "I
don't quite follow you. What do you mean to imply?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing. I don't suppose it matters much: it might have
been interesting as a side-issue." She broke off for a moment, then
added:</p>
<p>"Now tell me a little about the butler, the man whose wages were
cut down to increase Sandy's pay."</p>
<p>"Old John Hales? He's a thoroughly worthy, respectable man; he
was butler for five or six years to Mr. Craven's brother, when he
was master of Troyte's Hill, and then took duty under this Mr.
Craven. There's no ground for suspicion in that quarter. Hales's
exclamation when he heard of the murder is quite enough to stamp
him as an innocent man: 'Serve the old idiot right,' he cried: 'I
couldn't pump up a tear for him if I tried for a month of Sundays!'
Now I take it, Miss Brooke, a guilty man wouldn't dare make such a
speech as that!"</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="294" height=
"418" src="1302211h-images/13.gif"><br>
THE BUTLER.</p>
<p>"You think not?"</p>
<p>Griffiths stared at her. "I'm a little disappointed in her," he
thought. "I'm afraid her powers have been slightly exaggerated if
she can't see such a straight-forward thing as that."</p>
<p>Aloud he said, a little sharply, "Well, I don't stand alone in
my thinking. No one yet has breathed a word against Hales, and if
they did, I've no doubt he could prove an <i>alibi</i> without any
trouble, for he lives in the house, and everyone has a good word
for him."</p>
<p>"I suppose Sandy's lodge has been put into order by this
time?"</p>
<p>"Yes; after the inquest, and when all possible evidence had been
taken, everything was put straight."</p>
<p>"At the inquest it was stated that no marks of footsteps could
be traced in any direction?"</p>
<p>"The long drought we've had would render such a thing
impossible, let alone the fact that Sandy's lodge stands right on
the graveled drive, without flower-beds or grass borders of any
sort around it. But look here, Miss Brooke, don't you be wasting
your time over the lodge and its surroundings. Every iota of fact
on that matter has been gone through over and over again by me and
my chief. What we want you to do is to go straight into the house
and concentrate attention on Master Harry's sick-room, and find out
what's going on there. What he did outside the house on the night
of the 6th, I've no doubt I shall be able to find out for myself.
Now, Miss Brooke, you've asked me no end of questions, to which I
have replied as fully as it was in my power to do; will you be good
enough to answer one question that I wish to put, as
straightforwardly as I have answered yours? You have had fullest
particulars given you of the condition of Sandy's room when the
police entered it on the morning after the murder. No doubt, at the
present moment, you can see it all in your mind's eye&mdash;the
bedstead on its side, the clock on its head, the bed-clothes
half-way up the chimney, the little vases and ornaments walking in
a straight line towards the door?"</p>
<p>Loveday bowed her head.</p>
<p>"Very well, Now will you be good enough to tell me what this
scene of confusion recalls to your mind before anything else?"</p>
<p>"The room of an unpopular Oxford freshman after a raid upon it
by undergrads," answered Loveday promptly.</p>
<p>Mr. Griffiths rubbed his hands.</p>
<p>"Quite so!" he ejaculated. "I see, after all, we are one at
heart in this matter, in spite of a little surface disagreement of
ideas. Depend upon it, by-and-bye, like the engineers tunneling
from different quarters under the Alps, we shall meet at the same
point and shake hands. By-the-way, I have arranged for daily
communication between us through the postboy who takes the letters
to Troyte's Hill. He is trustworthy, and any letter you give him
for me will find its way into my hands within the hour."</p>
<p>It was about three o'clock in the afternoon when Loveday drove
in through the park gates of Troyte's Hill, past the lodge where
old Sandy had met with his death. It was a pretty little cottage,
covered with Virginia creeper and wild honeysuckle, and showing no
outward sign of the tragedy that had been enacted within.</p>
<p>The park and pleasure-grounds of Troyte's Hill were extensive,
and the house itself was a somewhat imposing red brick structure,
built, possibly, at the time when Dutch William's taste had grown
popular in the country. Its frontage presented a somewhat forlorn
appearance, its centre windows&mdash;a square of eight&mdash;alone
seeming to show signs of occupation. With the exception of two
windows at the extreme end of the bedroom floor of the north wing,
where, possibly, the invalid and his mother were located, and two
windows at the extreme end of the ground floor of the south wing,
which Loveday ascertained subsequently were those of Mr. Craven's
study, not a single window in either wing owned blind or curtain.
The wings were extensive, and it was easy to understand that at the
extreme end of the one the fever patient would be isolated from the
rest of the household, and that at the extreme end of the other Mr.
Craven could secure the quiet and freedom from interruption which,
no doubt, were essential to the due prosecution of his philological
studies.</p>
<p>Alike on the house and ill-kept grounds were present the stamp
of the smallness of the income of the master and owner of the
place. The terrace, which ran the length of the house in front, and
on to which every window on the ground floor opened, was miserably
out of repair: not a lintel or door-post, window-ledge or balcony
but what seemed to cry aloud for the touch of the painter. "Pity
me! I have seen better days," Loveday could fancy written as a
legend across the red-brick porch that gave entrance to the old
house.</p>
<p>The butler, John Hales, admitted Loveday, shouldered her
portmanteau and told her he would show her to her room. He was a
tall, powerfully-built man, with a ruddy face and dogged expression
of countenance. It was easy to understand that, off and on, there
must have been many a sharp encounter between him and old Sandy. He
treated Loveday in an easy, familiar fashion, evidently considering
that an amanuensis took much the same rank as a nursery
governess&mdash;that is to say, a little below a lady's maid and a
little above a house-maid.</p>
<p>"We're short of hands, just now," he said, in broad Cumberland
dialect, as he led the way up the wide stair case. "Some of the
lasses downstairs took fright at the fever and went home. Cook and
I are single-handed, for Moggie, the only maid left, has been told
off to wait on Madam and Master Harry. I hope you're not afeared of
fever?"</p>
<p>Loveday explained that she was not, and asked if the room at the
extreme end of the north wing was the one assigned to "Madam and
Master Harry."</p>
<p>"Yes," said the man; "it's convenient for sick nursing; there's
a flight of stairs runs straight down from it to the kitchen
quarters. We put all Madam wants at the foot of those stairs and
Moggie herself never enters the sick-room. I take it you'll not be
seeing Madam for many a day, yet awhile."</p>
<p>"When shall I see Mr. Craven? At dinner to-night?"</p>
<p>"That's what naebody could say," answered Hales. "He may not
come out of his study till past midnight; sometimes he sits there
till two or three in the morning. Shouldn't advise you to wait till
he wants his dinner&mdash;better have a cup of tea and a chop sent
up to you. Madam never waits for him at any meal."</p>
<p>As he finished speaking he deposited the portmanteau outside one
of the many doors opening into the gallery.</p>
<p>"This is Miss Craven's room," he went on; "cook and me thought
you'd better have it, as it would want less getting ready than the
other rooms, and work is work when there are so few hands to do it.
Oh, my stars! I do declare there is cook putting it straight for
you now." The last sentence was added as the opened door laid bare
to view, the cook, with a duster in her hand, polishing a mirror;
the bed had been made, it is true, but otherwise the room must have
been much as Miss Craven left it, after a hurried packing up.</p>
<p>To the surprise of the two servants Loveday took the matter very
lightly.</p>
<p>"I have a special talent for arranging rooms and would prefer
getting this one straight for myself," she said. "Now, if you will
go and get ready that chop and cup of tea we were talking about
just now, I shall think it much kinder than if you stayed here
doing what I can so easily do for myself."</p>
<p>When, however, the cook and butler had departed in company,
Loveday showed no disposition to exercise the "special talent" of
which she had boasted.</p>
<p>She first carefully turned the key in the lock and then
proceeded to make a thorough and minute investigation of every
corner of the room. Not an article of furniture, not an ornament or
toilet accessory, but what was lifted from its place and carefully
scrutinized. Even the ashes in the grate, the debris of the last
fire made there, were raked over and well looked through.</p>
<p>This careful investigation of Miss Craven's late surroundings
occupied in all about three quarters of an hour, and Loveday, with
her hat in her hand, descended the stairs to see Hales crossing the
hall to the dining-room with the promised cup of tea and chop.</p>
<p>In silence and solitude she partook of the simple repast in a
dining-hall that could with ease have banqueted a hundred and fifty
guests.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="310" height=
"344" src="1302211h-images/14.gif"><br>
IN SILENCE AND SOLITUDE SHE PARTOOK OF THE SIMPLE REPAST.</p>
<p>"Now for the grounds before it gets dark," she said to herself,
as she noted that already the outside shadows were beginning to
slant.</p>
<p>The dining-hall was at the back of the house; and here, as in
the front, the windows, reaching to the ground, presented easy
means of egress. The flower-garden was on this side of the house
and sloped downhill to a pretty stretch of well-wooded country.</p>
<p>Loveday did not linger here even to admire, but passed at once
round the south corner of the house to the windows which she had
ascertained, by a careless question to the butler, were those of
Mr. Craven's study.</p>
<p>Very cautiously she drew near them, for the blinds were up, the
curtains drawn back. A side glance, however, relieved her
apprehensions, for it showed her the occupant of the room, seated
in an easy-chair, with his back to the windows. From the length of
his outstretched limbs he was evidently a tall man. His hair was
silvery and curly, the lower part of his face was hidden from her
view by the chair, but she could see one hand was pressed tightly
across his eyes and brows. The whole attitude was that of a man
absorbed in deep thought. The room was comfortably furnished, but
presented an appearance of disorder from the books and manuscripts
scattered in all directions. A whole pile of torn fragments of
foolscap sheets, overflowing from a waste-paper basket beside the
writing-table, seemed to proclaim the fact that the scholar had of
late grown weary of, or else dissatisfied with his work, and had
condemned it freely.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="401" height=
"338" src="1302211h-images/15.gif"><br>
SEATED IN AN EASY-CHAIR WITH HIS BACK TO THE WINDOW.</p>
<p>Although Loveday stood looking in at this window for over five
minutes, not the faintest sign of life did that tall, reclining
figure give, and it would have been as easy to believe him locked
in sleep as in thought.</p>
<p>From here she turned her steps in the direction of Sandy's
lodge. As Griffiths had said, it was graveled up to its doorstep.
The blinds were closely drawn, and it presented the ordinary
appearance of a disused cottage.</p>
<p>A narrow path beneath over-arching boughs of cherry-laurel and
arbutus, immediately facing the lodge, caught her eye, and down
this she at once turned her footsteps.</p>
<p>This path led, with many a wind and turn, through a belt of
shrubbery that skirted the frontage of Mr. Craven's grounds, and
eventually, after much zig-zagging, ended in close proximity to the
stables. As Loveday entered it, she seemed literally to leave
daylight behind her.</p>
<p>"I feel as if I were following the course of a circuitous mind,"
she said to herself as the shadows closed around her. "I could not
fancy Sir Isaac Newton or Bacon planning or delighting in such a
wind-about-alley as this!"</p>
<p>The path showed greyly in front of her out of the dimness. On
and on she followed it; here and there the roots of the old
laurels, struggling out of the ground, threatened to trip her up.
Her eyes, however, had now grown accustomed to the half-gloom, and
not a detail of her surroundings escaped her as she went along.</p>
<p>A bird flew from out the thicket on her right hand with a
startled cry. A dainty little frog leaped out of her way into the
shriveled leaves lying below the laurels. Following the movements
of this frog, her eye was caught by something black and solid among
those leaves. What was it? A bundle&mdash;a shiny black coat?
Loveday knelt down, and using her hands to assist her eyes, found
that they came into contact with the dead, stiffened body of a
beautiful black retriever. She parted, as well as she was able, the
lower boughs of the evergreens, and minutely examined the poor
animal. Its eyes were still open, though glazed and bleared, and
its death had, undoubtedly, been caused by the blow of some blunt,
heavy instrument, for on one side its skull was almost battered
in.</p>
<p>"Exactly the death that was dealt to Sandy," she thought, as she
groped hither and thither beneath the trees in hopes of lighting
upon the weapon of destruction.</p>
<p>She searched until increasing darkness warned her that search
was useless. Then, still following the zig-zagging path, she made
her way out by the stables and thence back to the house.</p>
<p>She went to bed that night without having spoken to a soul
beyond the cook and butler. The next morning, however, Mr. Craven
introduced himself to her across the breakfast-table. He was a man
of really handsome personal appearance, with a fine carriage of the
head and shoulders, and eyes that had a forlorn, appealing look in
them. He entered the room with an air of great energy, apologized
to Loveday for the absence of his wife, and for his own remissness
in not being in the way to receive her on the previous day. Then he
bade her make herself at home at the breakfast-table, and expressed
his delight in having found a coadjutor in his work.</p>
<p>"I hope you understand what a great&mdash;a stupendous work it
is?" he added, as he sank into a chair. "It is a work that will
leave its impress upon thought in all the ages to come. Only a man
who has studied comparative philology as I have for the past thirty
years, could gauge the magnitude of the task I have set
myself."</p>
<p>With the last remark, his energy seemed spent, and he sank back
in his chair, covering his eyes with his hand in precisely the same
attitude as that in which Loveday had seen him over-night, and
utterly oblivious of the fact that breakfast was before him and a
stranger-guest seated at table. The butler entered with another
dish. "Better go on with your breakfast," he whispered to Loveday,
"he may sit like that for another hour."</p>
<p>He placed his dish in front of his master.</p>
<p>"Captain hasn't come back yet, sir," he said, making an effort
to arouse him from his reverie.</p>
<p>"Eh, what?" said Mr. Craven, for a moment lifting his hand from
his eyes.</p>
<p>"Captain, sir&mdash;the black retriever," repeated the man.</p>
<p>The pathetic look in Mr. Craven's eyes deepened.</p>
<p>"Ah, poor Captain!" he murmured; "the best dog I ever had."</p>
<p>Then he again sank back in his chair, putting his hand to his
forehead.</p>
<p>The butler made one more effort to arouse him.</p>
<p>"Madam sent you down a newspaper, sir, that she thought you
would like to see," he shouted almost into his master's ear, and at
the same time laid the morning's paper on the table beside his
plate.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="394" height=
"312" src="1302211h-images/16.gif"><br>
HE LAID THE MORNING'S PAPER BESIDE HIS PLATE.</p>
<p>"Confound you! leave it there," said Mr. Craven irritably.
"Fools! dolts that you all are! With your trivialities and
interruptions you are sending me out of the world with my work
undone!"</p>
<p>And again he sank back in his chair, closed his eyes and became
lost to his surroundings.</p>
<p>Loveday went on with her breakfast. She changed her place at
table to one on Mr. Craven's right hand, so that the newspaper sent
down for his perusal lay between his plate and hers. It was folded
into an oblong shape, as if it were wished to direct attention to a
certain portion of a certain column.</p>
<p>A clock in a corner of the room struck the hour with a loud,
resonant stroke. Mr. Craven gave a start and rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>"Eh, what's this?" he said. "What meal are we at?" He looked
around with a bewildered air. "Eh!&mdash;who are you?" he went on,
staring hard at Loveday. "What are you doing here? Where's
Nina?&mdash;Where's Harry?"</p>
<p>Loveday began to explain, and gradually recollection seemed to
come back to him.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, yes," he said. "I remember; you've come to assist me
with my great work. You promised, you know, to help me out of the
hole I've got into. Very enthusiastic, I remember they said you
were, on certain abstruse points in comparative philology. Now,
Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;I've forgotten your name&mdash;tell me a
little of what you know about the elemental sounds of speech that
are common to all languages. Now, to how many would you reduce
those elemental sounds&mdash;to six, eight, nine? No, we won't
discuss the matter here, the cups and saucers distract me. Come
into my den at the other end of the house; we'll have perfect quiet
there."</p>
<p>And utterly ignoring the fact that he had not as yet broken his
fast, he rose from the table, seized Loveday by the wrist, and led
her out of the room and down the long corridor that led through the
south wing to his study.</p>
<p>But seated in that study his energy once more speedily exhausted
itself.</p>
<p>He placed Loveday in a comfortable chair at his writing-table,
consulted her taste as to pens, and spread a sheet of foolscap
before her. Then he settled himself in his easy-chair, with his
back to the light, as if he were about to dictate folios to
her.</p>
<p>In a loud, distinct voice he repeated the title of his learned
work, then its sub-division, then the number and heading of the
chapter that was at present engaging his attention. Then he put his
hand to his head. "It's the elemental sounds that are my
stumbling-block," he said. "Now, how on earth is it possible to get
a notion of a sound of agony that is not in part a sound of terror?
or a sound of surprise that is not in part a sound of either joy or
sorrow?"</p>
<p>With this his energies were spent, and although Loveday remained
seated in that study from early morning till daylight began to
fade, she had not ten sentences to show for her day's work as
amanuensis.</p>
<p>Loveday in all spent only two clear days at Troyte's Hill.</p>
<p>On the evening of the first of those days Detective Griffiths
received, through the trustworthy post-boy, the following brief
note from her:</p>
<p>"I have found out that Hales owed Sandy close upon a hundred
pounds, which he had borrowed at various times. I don't know
whether you will think this fact of any importance.&mdash;L.
B."</p>
<p>Mr. Griffiths repeated the last sentence blankly. "If Harry
Craven were put upon his defence, his counsel, I take it, would
consider the fact of first importance," he muttered. And for the
remainder of that day Mr. Griffiths went about his work in a
perturbed state of mind, doubtful whether to hold or to let go his
theory concerning Harry Craven's guilt.</p>
<p>The next morning there came another brief note from Loveday
which ran thus:</p>
<p>"As a matter of collateral interest, find out if a person,
calling himself Harold Cousins, sailed two days ago from London
Docks for Natal in the <i>Bonnie Dundee?</i>"</p>
<p>To this missive Loveday received, in reply, the following
somewhat lengthy dispatch:</p>
<p>"I do not quite see the drift of your last note, but have wired
to our agents in London to carry out its suggestion. On my part, I
have important news to communicate. I have found out what Harry
Craven's business out of doors was on the night of the murder, and
at my instance a warrant has been issued for his arrest. This
warrant it will be my duty to serve on him in the course of to-day.
Things are beginning to look very black against him, and I am
convinced his illness is all a sham. I have seen Waters, the man
who is supposed to be attending him, and have driven him into a
corner and made him admit that he has only seen young Craven
once&mdash;on the first day of his illness&mdash;and that he gave
his certificate entirely on the strength of what Mrs. Craven told
him of her son's condition. On the occasion of this, his first and
only visit, the lady, it seems, also told him that it would not be
necessary for him to continue his attendance, as she quite felt
herself competent to treat the case, having had so much experience
in fever cases among the blacks at Natal.</p>
<p>"As I left Waters's house, after eliciting this important
information, I was accosted by a man who keeps a low-class inn in
the place, McQueen by name. He said that he wished to speak to me
on a matter of importance. To make a long story short, this McQueen
stated that on the night of the sixth, shortly after eleven
o'clock, Harry Craven came to his house, bringing with him a
valuable piece of plate&mdash;a handsome epergne&mdash;and
requested him to lend him a hundred pounds on it, as he hadn't a
penny in his pocket. McQueen complied with his request to the
extent of ten sovereigns, and now, in a fit of nervous terror,
comes to me to confess himself a receiver of stolen goods and play
the honest man! He says he noticed that the young gentleman was
very much agitated as he made the request, and he also begged him
to mention his visit to no one. Now, I am curious to learn how
Master Harry will get over the fact that he passed the lodge at the
hour at which the murder was most probably committed; or how he
will get out of the dilemma of having repassed the lodge on his way
back to the house, and not noticed the wide-open window with the
full moon shining down on it?</p>
<p>"Another word! Keep out of the way when I arrive at the house,
somewhere between two and three in the afternoon, to serve the
warrant. I do not wish your professional capacity to get wind, for
you will most likely yet be of some use to us in the house.</p>
<p align="right">"S.G."</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="510" height=
"435" src="1302211h-images/20.gif"><br>
WANTED A HUNDRED POUNDS.</p>
<p>Loveday read this note, seated at Mr. Craven's writing-table,
with the old gentleman himself reclining motionless beside her in
his easy-chair. A little smile played about the corners of her
mouth as she read over again the words&mdash;"for you will most
likely yet be of some use to us in the house."</p>
<p>Loveday's second day in Mr. Craven's study promised to be as
unfruitful as the first. For fully an hour after she had received
Griffiths' note, she sat at the writing-table with her pen in her
hand, ready to transcribe Mr. Craven's inspirations. Beyond,
however, the phrase, muttered with closed eyes&mdash;"It's all
here, in my brain, but I can't put it into words"&mdash;not a
half-syllable escaped his lips.</p>
<p>At the end of that hour the sound of footsteps on the outside
gravel made her turn her head towards the window. It was Griffiths
approaching with two constables. She heard the hall door opened to
admit them, but, beyond that, not a sound reached her ear, and she
realized how fully she was cut off from communication with the rest
of the household at the farther end of this unoccupied wing.</p>
<p>Mr. Craven, still reclining in his semi-trance, evidently had
not the faintest suspicion that so important an event as the arrest
of his only son on a charge of murder was about to be enacted in
the house.</p>
<p>Meantime, Griffiths and his constables had mounted the stairs
leading to the north wing, and were being guided through the
corridors to the sick-room by the flying figure of Moggie, the
maid.</p>
<p>"Hoot, mistress!" cried the girl, "here are three men coming up
the stairs&mdash;policemen, every one of them&mdash;will ye come
and ask them what they be wanting?"</p>
<p>Outside the door of the sick-room stood Mrs. Craven&mdash;a
tall, sharp-featured woman with sandy hair going rapidly grey.</p>
<p>"What is the meaning of this? What is your business here?" she
said haughtily, addressing Griffiths, who headed the party.</p>
<p>Griffiths respectfully explained what his business was, and
requested her to stand on one side that he might enter her son's
room.</p>
<p>"This is my daughter's room; satisfy yourself of the fact," said
the lady, throwing back the door as she spoke.</p>
<p>And Griffiths and his confr?res entered, to find pretty Miss
Craven, looking very white and scared, seated beside a fire in a
long flowing robe de chambre.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="283" height=
"410" src="1302211h-images/17.gif"><br>
MISS CRAVEN LOOKING VERY WHITE AND SCARED.</p>
<p>Griffiths departed in haste and confusion, without the chance of
a professional talk with Loveday. That afternoon saw him
telegraphing wildly in all directions, and dispatching messengers
in all quarters. Finally he spent over an hour drawing up an
elaborate report to his chief at Newcastle, assuring him of the
identity of one, Harold Cousins, who had sailed in the <i>Bonnie
Dundee</i> for Natal, with Harry Craven, of Troyte's Hill, and
advising that the police authorities in that far-away district
should be immediately communicated with.</p>
<p>The ink had not dried on the pen with which this report was
written before a note, in Loveday's writing, was put into his
hand.</p>
<p>Loveday evidently had had some difficulty in finding a messenger
for this note, for it was brought by a gardener's boy, who informed
Griffiths that the lady had said he would receive a gold sovereign
if he delivered the letter all right.</p>
<p>Griffiths paid the boy and dismissed him, and then proceeded to
read Loveday's communication.</p>
<p>It was written hurriedly in pencil, and ran as follows:</p>
<p>"Things are getting critical here. Directly you receive this,
come up to the house with two of your men, and post yourselves
anywhere in the grounds where you can see and not be seen. There
will be no difficulty in this, for it will be dark by the time you
are able to get there. I am not sure whether I shall want your aid
to-night, but you had better keep in the grounds until morning, in
case of need; and above all, never once lose sight of the study
windows." (This was underscored.) "If I put a lamp with a green
shade in one of those windows, do not lose a moment in entering by
that window, which I will contrive to keep unlocked."</p>
<p>Detective Griffiths rubbed his forehead&mdash;rubbed his eyes,
as he finished reading this.</p>
<p>"Well, I daresay it's all right," he said, "but I'm bothered,
that's all, and for the life of me I can't see one step of the way
she is going."</p>
<p>He looked at his watch: the hands pointed to a quarter past six.
The short September day was drawing rapidly to a close. A good five
miles lay between him and Troyte's Hill&mdash;there was evidently
not a moment to lose.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="147" height=
"409" src="1302211h-images/18.gif"><br>
GRIFFITHS LOOKED AT HIS WATCH.</p>
<p>At the very moment that Griffiths, with his two constables, were
once more starting along the Grenfell High Road behind the best
horse they could procure, Mr. Craven was rousing himself from his
long slumber, and beginning to look around him. That slumber,
however, though long, had not been a peaceful one, and it was
sundry of the old gentleman's muttered exclamations, as he had
started uneasily in his sleep, that had caused Loveday to open, and
then to creep out of the room to dispatch, her hurried note.</p>
<p>What effect the occurrence of the morning had had upon the
household generally, Loveday, in her isolated corner of the house,
had no means of ascertaining. She only noted that when Hales
brought in her tea, as he did precisely at five o'clock, he wore a
particularly ill-tempered expression of countenance, and she heard
him mutter, as he set down the tea-tray with a clatter, something
about being a respectable man, and not used to such "goings
on."</p>
<p>It was not until nearly an hour and a half after this that Mr.
Craven had awakened with a sudden start, and, looking wildly around
him, had questioned Loveday who had entered the room.</p>
<p>Loveday explained that the butler had brought in lunch at one,
and tea at five, but that since then no one had come in.</p>
<p>"Now that's false," said Mr. Craven, in a sharp, unnatural sort
of voice; "I saw him sneaking round the room, the whining, canting
hypocrite, and you must have seen him, too! Didn't you hear him
say, in his squeaky old voice: 'Master, I knows your
secret&mdash;'" He broke off abruptly, looking wildly round. "Eh,
what's this?" he cried. "No, no, I'm all wrong&mdash;Sandy is dead
and buried&mdash;they held an inquest on him, and we all praised
him up as if he were a saint."</p>
<p>"He must have been a bad man, that old Sandy," said Loveday
sympathetically.</p>
<p>"You're right! you're right!" cried Mr. Craven, springing up
excitedly from his chair and seizing her by the hand. "If ever a
man deserved his death, he did. For thirty years he held that rod
over my head, and then&mdash;ah where was I?"</p>
<p>He put his hand to his head and again sank, as if exhausted,
into his chair.</p>
<p>"I suppose it was some early indiscretion of yours at college
that he knew of?" said Loveday, eager to get at as much of the
truth as possible while the mood for confidence held sway in the
feeble brain.</p>
<p>"That was it! I was fool enough to marry a disreputable
girl&mdash;a barmaid in the town&mdash;and Sandy was present at the
wedding, and then&mdash;" Here his eyes closed again and his
mutterings became incoherent.</p>
<p>For ten minutes he lay back in his chair, muttering thus; "A
yelp&mdash;a groan," were the only words Loveday could distinguish
among those mutterings, then suddenly, slowly and distinctly, he
said, as if answering some plainly-put question: "A good blow with
the hammer and the thing was done."</p>
<p>"I should like amazingly to see that hammer," said Loveday; "do
you keep it anywhere at hand?"</p>
<p>His eyes opened with a wild, cunning look in them.</p>
<p>"Who's talking about a hammer? I did not say I had one. If
anyone says I did it with a hammer, they're telling a lie."</p>
<p>"Oh, you've spoken to me about the hammer two or three times,"
said Loveday calmly; "the one that killed your dog, Captain, and I
should like to see it, that's all."</p>
<p>The look of cunning died out of the old man's eye&mdash;"Ah,
poor Captain! splendid dog that! Well, now, where were we? Where
did we leave off? Ah, I remember, it was the elemental sounds of
speech that bothered me so that night. Were you here then? Ah, no!
I remember. I had been trying all day to assimilate a dog's yelp of
pain to a human groan, and I couldn't do it. The idea haunted
me&mdash;followed me about wherever I went. If they were both
elemental sounds, they must have something in common, but the link
between them I could not find; then it occurred to me, would a
well-bred, well-trained dog like my Captain in the stables, there,
at the moment of death give an unmitigated currish yelp; would
there not be something of a human note in his death-cry? The thing
was worth putting to the test. If I could hand down in my treatise
a fragment of fact on the matter, it would be worth a dozen dogs'
lives. so I went out into the moonlight&mdash;ah, but you know all
about it&mdash;now, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Poor Captain! did he yelp or groan?"</p>
<p>"Why, he gave one loud, long, hideous yelp, just as if he had
been a common cur. I might just as well have let him alone; it only
set that other brute opening his window and spying out on me, and
saying in his cracked old voice: 'Master, what are you doing out
here at this time of night?'"</p>
<p>Again he sank back in his chair, muttering incoherently with
half-closed eyes.</p>
<p>Loveday let him alone for a minute or so; then she had another
question to ask.</p>
<p>"And that other brute&mdash;did he yelp or groan when you dealt
him his blow?"</p>
<p>"What, old Sandy&mdash;the brute? he fell back&mdash;Ah, I
remember, you said you would like to see the hammer that stopped
his babbling old tongue&mdash;now didn't you?"</p>
<p>He rose a little unsteadily from his chair, and seemed to drag
his long limbs with an effort across the room to a cabinet at the
farther end. Opening a drawer in this cabinet, he produced, from
amidst some specimens of strata and fossils, a large-sized
geological hammer.</p>
<p>He brandished it for a moment over his head, then paused with
his finger on his lip.</p>
<p>"Hush!" he said, "we shall have the fools creeping in to peep at
us if we don't take care." And to Loveday's horror he suddenly made
for the door, turned the key in the lock, withdrew it and put it
into his pocket.</p>
<p>She looked at the clock; the hands pointed to half-past seven.
Had Griffiths received her note at the proper time, and were the
men now in the grounds? She could only pray that they were.</p>
<p>"The light is too strong for my eyes," she said, and rising from
her chair, she lifted the green-shaded lamp and placed it on a
table that stood at the window.</p>
<p>"No, no, that won't do," said Mr. Craven; "that would show
everyone outside what we're doing in here." He crossed to the
window as he spoke and removed the lamp thence to the
mantelpiece.</p>
<p>Loveday could only hope that in the few seconds it had remained
in the window it had caught the eye of the outside watchers.</p>
<p>The old man beckoned to Loveday to come near and examine his
deadly weapon. "Give it a good swing round," he said, suiting the
action to the word, "and down it comes with a splendid crash." He
brought the hammer round within an inch of Loveday's forehead.</p>
<p>She started back.</p>
<p>"Ha, ha," he laughed harshly and unnaturally, with the light of
madness dancing in his eyes now; "did I frighten you? I wonder what
sort of sound you would make if I were to give you a little tap
just there." Here he lightly touched her forehead with the hammer.
"Elemental, of course, it would be, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>Loveday steadied her nerves with difficulty. Locked in with this
lunatic, her only chance lay in gaining time for the detectives to
reach the house and enter through the window.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute," she said, striving to divert his attention;
"you have not yet told me what sort of an elemental sound old Sandy
made when he fell. If you'll give me pen and ink, I'll write down a
full account of it all, and you can incorporate it afterwards in
your treatise."</p>
<p>For a moment a look of real pleasure flitted across the old
man's face, then it faded. "The brute fell back dead without a
sound," he answered; "it was all for nothing, that night's work;
yet not altogether for nothing. No, I don't mind owning I would do
it all over again to get the wild thrill of joy at my heart that I
had when I looked down into that old man's dead face and felt
myself free at last! Free at last!" his voice rang out
excitedly&mdash;once more he brought his hammer round with an ugly
swing.</p>
<p>"For a moment I was a young man again; I leaped into his
room&mdash;the moon was shining full in through the window&mdash;I
thought of my old college days, and the fun we used to have at
Pembroke&mdash;topsy turvey I turned everything&mdash;" He broke
off abruptly, and drew a step nearer to Loveday. "The pity of it
all was," he said, suddenly dropping from his high, excited tone to
a low, pathetic one, "that he fell without a sound of any sort."
Here he drew another step nearer. "I wonder&mdash;" he said, then
broke off again, and came close to Loveday's side. "It has only
this moment occurred to me," he said, now with his lips close to
Loveday's ear, "that a woman, in her death agony, would be much
more likely to give utterance to an elemental sound than a
man."</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="367" height=
"430" src="1302211h-images/19.gif"><br>
WITH HIS LIPS CLOSE TO LOVEDAY'S EAR.</p>
<p>He raised his hammer, and Loveday fled to the window, and was
lifted from the outside by three pairs of strong arms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I thought I was conducting my very last case&mdash;I never had
such a narrow escape before!" said Loveday, as she stood talking
with Mr. Griffiths on the Grenfell platform, awaiting the train to
carry her back to London. "It seems strange that no one before
suspected the old gentleman's sanity&mdash;I suppose, however,
people were so used to his eccentricities that they did not notice
how they had deepened into positive lunacy. His cunning evidently
stood him in good stead at the inquest."</p>
<p>"It is possible" said Griffiths thoughtfully, "that he did not
absolutely cross the very slender line that divided eccentricity
from madness until after the murder. The excitement consequent upon
the discovery of the crime may just have pushed him over the
border. Now, Miss Brooke, we have exactly ten minutes before your
train comes in. I should feel greatly obliged to you if you would
explain one or two things that have a professional interest for
me."</p>
<p>"With pleasure," said Loveday. "Put your questions in
categorical order and I will answer them."</p>
<p>"Well, then, in the first place, what suggested to your mind the
old man's guilt?"</p>
<p>"The relations that subsisted between him and Sandy seemed to me
to savour too much of fear on the one side and power on the other.
Also the income paid to Sandy during Mr. Craven's absence in Natal
bore, to my mind, an unpleasant resemblance to hush-money."</p>
<p>"Poor wretched being! And I hear that, after all, the woman he
married in his wild young days died soon afterwards of drink. I
have no doubt, however, that Sandy sedulously kept up the fiction
of her existence, even after his master's second marriage. Now for
another question: how was it you knew that Miss Craven had taken
her brother's place in the sick-room?"</p>
<p>"On the evening of my arrival I discovered a rather long lock of
fair hair in the unswept fireplace of my room, which, as it
happened, was usually occupied by Miss Craven. It at once occurred
to me that the young lady had been cutting off her hair and that
there must be some powerful motive to induce such a sacrifice. The
suspicious circumstances attending her brother's illness soon
supplied me with such a motive."</p>
<p>"Ah! that typhoid fever business was very cleverly done. Not a
servant in the house, I verily believe, but who thought Master
Harry was upstairs, ill in bed, and Miss Craven away at her
friends' in Newcastle. The young fellow must have got a clear start
off within an hour of the murder. His sister, sent away the next
day to Newcastle, dismissed her maid there, I hear, on the plea of
no accommodation at her friends' house&mdash;sent the girl to her
own home for a holiday and herself returned to Troyte's Hill in the
middle of the night, having walked the five miles from Grenfell. No
doubt her mother admitted her through one of those easily-opened
front windows, cut her hair and put her to bed to personate her
brother without delay. With Miss Craven's strong likeness to Master
Harry, and in a darkened room, it is easy to understand that the
eyes of a doctor, personally unacquainted with the family, might
easily be deceived. Now, Miss Brooke, you must admit that with all
this elaborate chicanery and double dealing going on, it was only
natural that my suspicions should set in strongly in that
quarter."</p>
<p>"I read it all in another light, you see," said Loveday. "It
seemed to me that the mother, knowing her son's evil proclivities,
believed in his guilt, in spite, possibly, of his assertions of
innocence. The son, most likely, on his way back to the house after
pledging the family plate, had met old Mr. Craven with the hammer
in his hand. Seeing, no doubt, how impossible it would be for him
to clear himself without incriminating his father, he preferred
flight to Natal to giving evidence at the inquest."</p>
<p>"Now about his alias?" said Mr. Griffiths briskly, for the train
was at that moment steaming into the station. "How did you know
that Harold Cousins was identical with Harry Craven, and had sailed
in the <i>Bonnie Dundee</i>?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that was easy enough," said Loveday, as she stepped into
the train; "a newspaper sent down to Mr. Craven by his wife, was
folded so as to direct his attention to the shipping list. In it I
saw that the <i>Bonnie Dundee</i> had sailed two days previously
for Natal. Now it was only natural to connect Natal with Mrs.
Craven, who had passed the greater part of her life there; and it
was easy to understand her wish to get her scapegrace son among her
early friends. The alias under which he sailed came readily enough
to light. I found it scribbled all over one of Mr. Craven's writing
pads in his study; evidently it had been drummed into his ears by
his wife as his son's alias, and the old gentleman had taken this
method of fixing it in his memory. We'll hope that the young
fellow, under his new name, will make a new reputation for
himself&mdash;at any rate, he'll have a better chance of doing so
with the ocean between him and his evil companions. Now it's
good-bye, I think."</p>
<p>"No," said Mr. Griffiths; "it's au revoir, for you'll have to
come back again for the assizes, and give the evidence that will
shut old Mr. Craven in an asylum for the rest of his life."</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="III" id="III"><i>THE REDHILL
SISTERHOOD.</i></a></h3>
<p>"T<small>HEY</small> want you at Redhill, now," said Mr. Dyer,
taking a packet of papers from one of his pigeon-holes. "The idea
seems gaining ground in manly quarters that in cases of mere
suspicion, women detectives are more satisfactory than men, for
they are less likely to attract attention. And this Redhill affair,
so far as I can make out, is one of suspicion only."</p>
<p>It was a dreary November morning; every gas jet in the Lynch
Court office was alight, and a yellow curtain of outside fog draped
its narrow windows.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, I suppose one can't afford to leave it
uninvestigated at this season of the year, with country-house
robberies beginning in so many quarters," said Miss Brooke.</p>
<p>"No; and the circumstances in this case certainly seem to point
in the direction of the country-house burglar. Two days ago a
somewhat curious application was made privately, by a man giving
the name of John Murray, to Inspector Gunning, of the Reigate
police&mdash;Redhill, I must tell you is in the Reigate police
district. Murray stated that he had been a greengrocer somewhere in
South London, had sold his business there, and had, with the
proceeds of the sale, bought two small houses in Redhill, intending
to let the one and live in the other. These houses are situated in
a blind alley, known as Paved Court, a narrow turning leading off
the London and Brighton coach road. Paved Court has been known to
the sanitary authorities for the past ten years as a regular fever
nest, and as the houses which Murray bought&mdash;numbers 7 and
8&mdash;stand at the very end of the blind alley, with no chance of
thorough ventilation, I dare say the man got them for next to
nothing. He told the Inspector that he had had great difficulty in
procuring a tenant for the house he wished to let, number 8, and
that consequently when, about three weeks back, a lady, dressed as
a nun, made him an offer for it, he immediately closed with her.
The lady gave her name simply as 'Sister Monica,' and stated that
she was a member of an undenominational Sisterhood that had
recently been founded by a wealthy lady, who wished her name kept a
secret. Sister Monica gave no references, but, instead, paid a
quarter's rent in advance, saying that she wished to take
possession of the house immediately, and open it as a home for
crippled orphans."</p>
<p>"Gave no references&mdash;home for cripples," murmured Loveday,
scribbling hard and fast in her note-book.</p>
<p>"Murray made no objection to this," continued Mr. Dyer, "and,
accordingly, the next day, Sister Monica, accompanied by three
other Sisters and some sickly children, took possession of the
house, which they furnished with the barest possible necessaries
from cheap shops in the neighbourhood. For a time, Murray said, he
thought he had secured most desirable tenants, but during the last
ten days suspicions as to their real character have entered his
mind, and these suspicions he thought it his duty to communicate to
the police. Among their possessions, it seems, these Sisters number
an old donkey and a tiny cart, and this they start daily on a sort
of begging tour through the adjoining villages, bringing back every
evening a perfect hoard of broken victuals and bundles of old
garments. Now comes the extraordinary fact on which Murray bases
his suspicions. He says, and Gunning verifies his statement, that
in whatever direction those Sisters turn the wheels of their
donkey-cart, burglaries, or attempts at burglaries, are sure to
follow. A week ago they went along towards Horley, where, at an
outlying house, they received much kindness from a wealthy
gentleman. That very night an attempt was made to break into that
gentleman's house&mdash;an attempt, however, that was happily
frustrated by the barking of the house-dog. And so on in other
instances that I need not go into. Murray suggests that it might be
as well to have the daily movements of these sisters closely
watched, and that extra vigilance should be exercised by the police
in the districts that have had the honour of a morning call from
them. Gunning coincides with this idea, and so has sent to me to
secure your services."</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="385" height=
"281" src="1302211h-images/22.gif"><br>
THEY START DAILY ON A SORT OF BEGGING TOUR.</p>
<p>Loveday closed her note-book. "I suppose Gunning will meet me
somewhere and tell me where I'm to take up my quarters?" she
said.</p>
<p>"Yes; he will get into your carriage at Merstham&mdash;the
station before Redhill&mdash;if you will put your hand out of
window, with the morning paper in it. By-the-way, he takes it for
granted that you will save the 11.5 train from Victoria. Murray, it
seems has been good enough to place his little house at the
disposal of the police, but Gunning does not think espionage could
be so well carried on there as from other quarters. The presence of
a stranger in an alley of that sort is bound to attract attention.
So he has hired a room for you in a draper's shop that immediately
faces the head of the court. There is a private door to this shop
of which you will have the key, and can let yourself in and out as
you please. You are supposed to be a nursery governess on the
lookout for a situation, and Gunning will keep you supplied with
letters to give colour to the idea. He suggests that you need only
occupy the room during the day, at night you will find far more
comfortable quarters at Laker's Hotel, just outside the town."</p>
<p>This was about the sum total of the instructions that Mr. Dyer
had to give.</p>
<p>The 11.5 train from Victoria, that carried Loveday to her work
among the Surrey Hills, did not get clear of the London fog till
well away on the other side of Purley. When the train halted at
Merstham, in response to her signal a tall, soldier-like individual
made for her carriage, and, jumping in, took the seat facing her.
He introduced himself to her as Inspector Gunning, recalled to her
memory a former occasion on which they had met, and then, naturally
enough, turned the talk upon the present suspicious circumstances
they were bent upon investigating.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="310" height=
"324" src="1302211h-images/21.gif"><br>
HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF.</p>
<p>"It won't do for you and me to be seen together," he said; "of
course I am known for miles round, and anyone seen in my company
will be at once set down as my coadjutor, and spied upon
accordingly. I walked from Redhill to Merstham on purpose to avoid
recognition on the platform at Redhill, and half-way here, to my
great annoyance, found that I was being followed by a man in a
workman's dress and carrying a basket of tools. I doubled, however,
and gave him the slip, taking a short cut down a lane which, if he
had been living in the place, he would have known as well as I did.
By Jove!" this was added with a sudden start, "there is the fellow,
I declare; he has weathered me after all, and has no doubt taken
good stock of us both, with the train going at this snail's pace.
It was unfortunate that your face should have been turned towards
that window, Miss Brooke."</p>
<p>"My veil is something of a disguise, and I will put on another
cloak before he has a chance of seeing me again," said Loveday.</p>
<p>All she had seen in the brief glimpse that the train had
allowed, was a tall, powerfully-built man walking along a siding of
the line. His cap was drawn low over his eyes, and in his hand he
carried a workman's basket.</p>
<p>Gunning seemed much annoyed at the circumstance. "Instead of
landing at Redhill," he said, "we'll go on to Three Bridges and
wait there for a Brighton train to bring us back, that will enable
you to get to your room somewhere between the lights; I don't want
to have you spotted before you've so much as started your
work."</p>
<p>Then they went back to their discussion of the Redhill
Sisterhood.</p>
<p>"They call themselves 'undenominational,' whatever that means,"
said Gunning "they say they are connected with no religious sect
whatever, they attend sometimes one place of worship, sometimes
another, sometimes none at all. They refuse to give up the name of
the founder of their order, and really no one has any right to
demand it of them, for, as no doubt you see, up to the present
moment the case is one of mere suspicion, and it may be a pure
coincidence that attempts at burglary have followed their footsteps
in this neighbourhood. By-the-way, I have heard of a man's face
being enough to hang him, but until I saw Sister Monica's, I never
saw a woman's face that could perform the same kind office for her.
Of all the lowest criminal types of faces I have ever seen, I think
hers is about the lowest and most repulsive."</p>
<p>After the Sisters, they passed in review the chief families
resident in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>."This," said Gunning, unfolding a paper, "is a map I have
specially drawn up for you&mdash;it takes in the district for ten
miles round Redhill, and every country house of any importance is
marked with it in red ink. Here, in addition, is an index to those
houses, with special notes of my own to every house."</p>
<p>Loveday studied the map for a minute or so, then turned her
attention to the index.</p>
<p>"Those four houses you've marked, I see, are those that have
been already attempted. I don't think I'll run them through, but
I'll mark them 'doubtful;' you see the gang&mdash;for, of course,
it is a gang&mdash;might follow our reasoning on the matter, and
look upon those houses as our weak point. Here's one I'll run
through, 'house empty during winter months,' that means plate and
jewellery sent to the bankers. Oh! and this one may as well be
crossed off, 'father and four sons all athletes and sportsmen,'
that means firearms always handy&mdash;I don't think burglars will
be likely to trouble them. Ah! now we come to something! Here's a
house to be marked 'tempting' in a burglar's list. 'Wootton Hall,
lately changed hands and re-built, with complicated passages and
corridors. Splendid family plate in daily use and left entirely to
the care of the butler.' I wonder, does the master of that house
trust to his 'complicated passages' to preserve his plate for him?
A dismissed dishonest servant would supply a dozen maps of the
place for half-a-sovereign. What do these initials, 'E.L.,' against
the next house in the list, North Cape, stand for?"</p>
<p>"Electric lighted. I think you might almost cross that house off
also. I consider electric lighting one of the greatest safeguards
against burglars that a man can give his house."</p>
<p>"Yes, if he doesn't rely exclusively upon it; it might be a
nasty trap under certain circumstances. I see this gentleman also
has magnificent presentation and other plate."</p>
<p>"Yes. Mr. Jameson is a wealthy man and very popular in the
neighbourhood; his cups and epergnes are worth looking at."</p>
<p>"Is it the only house in the district that is lighted with
electricity?"</p>
<p>"Yes; and, begging your pardon, Miss Brooke, I only wish it were
not so. If electric lighting were generally in vogue it would save
the police a lot of trouble on these dark winter nights."</p>
<p>"The burglars would find some way of meeting such a condition of
things, depend upon it; they have reached a very high development
in these days. They no longer stalk about as they did fifty years
ago with blunderbuss and bludgeon; they plot, plan, contrive and
bring imagination and artistic resource to their aid. By-the-way,
it often occurs to me that the popular detective stories, for which
there seems to large a demand at the present day, must be, at
times, uncommonly useful to the criminal classes."</p>
<p>At Three Bridges they had to wait so long for a return train
that it was nearly dark when Loveday got back to Redhill. Mr.
Gunning did not accompany her thither, having alighted at a
previous station. Loveday had directed her portmanteau to be sent
direct to Laker's Hotel, where she had engaged a room by telegram
from Victoria Station. So, unburthened by luggage, she slipped
quietly out of the Redhill Station and made her way straight for
the draper's shop in the London Road. She had no difficulty in
finding it, thanks to the minute directions given her by the
Inspector.</p>
<p>Street lamps were being lighted in the sleepy little town as she
went along, and as she turned into the London Road, shopkeepers
were lighting up their windows on both sides of the way. A few
yards down this road, a dark patch between the lighted shops showed
her where Paved Court led off from the thoroughfare. A side-door of
one of the shops that stood at the corner of the court seemed to
offer a post of observation whence she could see without being
seen, and here Loveday, shrinking into the shadows, ensconced
herself in order to take stock of the little alley and its
inhabitants. She found it much as it had been described to
her&mdash;a collection of four-roomed houses of which more than
half were unlet. Numbers 7 and 8 at the head of the court presented
a slightly less neglected appearance than the other tenements.
Number 7 stood in total darkness, but in the upper window of number
8 there showed what seemed to be a night-light burning, so Loveday
conjectured that this possibly was the room set apart as a
dormitory for the little cripples.</p>
<p>While she stood thus surveying the home of the suspected
Sisterhood, the Sisters themselves&mdash;two, at least, of
them&mdash;came into view, with their donkey-cart and their
cripples, in the main road. It was an odd little cort?ge. One
Sister, habited in a nun's dress of dark blue serge, led the donkey
by the bridle; another Sister, similarly attired, walked alongside
the low cart, in which were seated two sickly-looking children.
They were evidently returning from one of their long country
circuits, and unless they had lost their way and been
belated&mdash;it certainly seemed a late hour for the sickly little
cripples to be abroad.</p>
<p>As they passed under the gas lamp at the corner of the court,
Loveday caught a glimpse of the faces of the Sisters. It was easy,
with Inspector Gunning's description before her mind, to identify
the older and taller woman as Sister Monica, and a more
coarse-featured and generally repellant face Loveday admitted to
herself she had never before seen. In striking contrast to this
forbidding countenance, was that of the younger Sister. Loveday
could only catch a brief passing view of it, but that one brief
view was enough to impress it on her memory as of unusual sadness
and beauty. As the donkey stopped at the corner of the court,
Loveday heard this sad-looking young woman addressed as "Sister
Anna" by one of the cripples, who asked plaintively when they were
going to have something to eat.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="344" height=
"431" src="1302211h-images/23.gif"><br>
SISTER ANNA.</p>
<p>"Now, at once," said Sister Anna, lifting the little one, as it
seemed to Loveday, tenderly out of the cart, and carrying him on
her shoulder down the court to the door of number 8, which opened
to them at their approach. The other Sister did the same with the
other child; then both Sisters returned, unloaded the cart of
sundry bundles and baskets, and, this done, led off the old donkey
and trap down the road, possibly to a neighbouring costermonger's
stables.</p>
<p>A man, coming along on a bicycle, exchanged a word of greeting
with the Sisters as they passed, then swung himself off his machine
at the corner of the court, and walked it along the paved way to
the door of number 7. This he opened with a key, and then, pushing
the machine before him, entered the house.</p>
<p>Loveday took it for granted that this man must be the John
Murray of whom she had heard. She had closely scrutinized him as he
had passed her, and had seen that he was a dark, well-featured man
of about fifty years of age.</p>
<p>She congratulated herself on her good fortune in having seen so
much in such a brief space of time, and coming forth from her
sheltered corner turned her steps in the direction of the draper's
shop on the other side of the road.</p>
<p>It was easy to find it. "Golightly" was the singular name that
figured above the shop-front, in which were displayed a variety of
goods calculated to meet the wants of servants and the poorer
classes generally. A tall, powerfully-built man appeared to be
looking in at this window. Loveday's foot was on the doorstep of
the draper's private entrance, her hand on the door-knocker, when
this individual, suddenly turning, convinced her of his identity
with the journeyman workman who had so disturbed Mr. Gunning's
equanimity. It was true he wore a bowler instead of a journeyman's
cap, and he no longer carried a basket of tools, but there was no
possibility for anyone, with so good an eye for an outline as
Loveday possessed, not to recognize the carriage of the head and
shoulders as that of the man she had seen walking along the railway
siding. He gave her no time to make minute observation of his
appearance, but turned quickly away, and disappeared down a
by-street.</p>
<p>Loveday's work seemed to bristle with difficulties now. Here was
she, as it were, unearthed in her own ambush; for there could be
but little doubt that during the whole time she had stood watching
those Sisters, that man, from a safe vantage point, had been
watching her.</p>
<p>She found Mrs. Golightly a civil and obliging person. She showed
Loveday to her room above the shop, brought her the letters which
Inspector Gunning had been careful to have posted to her during the
day. Then she supplied her with pen and ink and, in response to
Loveday's request, with some strong coffee that she said, with a
little attempt at a joke, would "keep a dormouse awake all through
the winter without winking."</p>
<p>While the obliging landlady busied herself about the room,
Loveday had a few questions to ask about the Sisterhood who lived
down the court opposite. On this head, however, Mrs. Golightly
could tell her no more than she already knew, beyond the fact that
they started every morning on their rounds at eleven o'clock
punctually, and that before that hour they were never to be seen
outside their door.</p>
<p>Loveday's watch that night was to be a fruitless one. Although
she sat, with her lamp turned out and safely screened from
observation, until close upon midnight, with eyes fixed upon
numbers 7 and 8 Paved Court, not so much as a door opening or
shutting at either house rewarded her vigil. The lights flitted
from the lower to the upper floors in both houses, and then
disappeared somewhere between nine and ten in the evening; and
after that, not a sign of life did either tenement show.</p>
<p>And all through the long hours of that watch, backwards and
forwards there seemed to flit before her mind's eye, as if in some
sort it were fixed upon its retina, the sweet, sad face of Sister
Anna.</p>
<p>Why it was this face should so haunt her, she found it hard to
say.</p>
<p>"It has a mournful past and a mournful future written upon it as
a hopeless whole," she said to herself. "It is the face of an
Andromeda! 'here am I,' it seems to say, 'tied to my stake,
helpless and hopeless.'"</p>
<p>The church clocks were sounding the midnight hour as Loveday
made her way through the dark streets to her hotel outside the
town. As she passed under the railway arch that ended in the open
country road, the echo of not very distant footsteps caught her
ear. When she stopped they stopped, when she went on they went on,
and she knew that once more she was being followed and watched,
although the darkness of the arch prevented her seeing even the
shadow of the man who was thus dogging her steps.</p>
<p>The next morning broke keen and frosty. Loveday studied her map
and her country-house index over a seven o'clock breakfast, and
then set off for a brisk walk along the country road. No doubt in
London the streets were walled in and roofed with yellow fog; here,
however, bright sunshine played in and out of the bare tree-boughs
and leafless hedges on to a thousand frost spangles, turning the
prosaic macadamized road into a gangway fit for Queen Titania
herself and her fairy train.</p>
<p>Loveday turned her back on the town and set herself to follow
the road as it wound away over the hill in the direction of a
village called Northfield. Early as she was, she was not to have
that road to herself. A team of strong horses trudged by on their
way to their work in the fuller's-earth pits. A young fellow on a
bicycle flashed past at a tremendous pace, considering the upward
slant of the road. He looked hard at her as he passed, then
slackened pace, dismounted, and awaited her coming on the brow of
the hill.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Miss Brooke," he said, lifting his cap as she
came alongside of him. "May I have five minutes' talk with
you?"</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="410" height=
"354" src="1302211h-images/24.gif"><br>
"GOOD MORNING, MISS BROOKE."</p>
<p>The young man who thus accosted her had not the appearance of a
gentleman. He was a handsome, bright-faced young fellow of about
two-and-twenty, and was dressed in ordinary cyclists' dress; his
cap was pushed back from his brow over thick, curly, fair hair, and
Loveday, as she looked at him, could not repress the thought how
well he would look at the head of a troop of cavalry, giving the
order to charge the enemy.</p>
<p>He led his machine to the side of the footpath.</p>
<p>"You have the advantage of me," said Loveday; "I haven't the
remotest notion who you are."</p>
<p>"No," he said; "although I know you, you cannot possibly know
me. I am a north country man, and I was present, about a month ago,
at the trial of old Mr. Craven, of Troyte's Hill&mdash;in fact, I
acted as reporter for one of the local papers. I watched your face
so closely as you gave your evidence that I should know it
anywhere, among a thousand."</p>
<p>"And your name is&mdash;?"</p>
<p>"George White, of Grenfell. My father is part proprietor of one
of the Newcastle papers. I am a bit of a literary man myself, and
sometimes figure as a reporter, sometimes as leader-writer, to that
paper." Here he gave a glance towards his side pocket, from which
protruded a small volume of Tennyson's poems.</p>
<p>The facts he had stated did not seem to invite comment, and
Loveday ejaculated merely:</p>
<p>"Indeed!"</p>
<p>The young man went back to the subject that was evidently
filling his thoughts. "I have special reasons for being glad to
have met you this morning, Miss Brooke," he want on, making his
footsteps keep pace with hers. "I am in great trouble, and I
believe you are the only person in the whole world who can help me
out of that trouble."</p>
<p>"I am rather doubtful as to my power of helping anyone out of
trouble," said Loveday; "so far as my experience goes, our troubles
are as much a part of ourselves as our skins are of our
bodies."</p>
<p>"Ah, but not such trouble as mine," said White eagerly. He broke
off for a moment, then, with a sudden rush of words, told her what
that trouble was. For the past year he had been engaged to be
married to a young girl, who, until quite recently had been
fulfilling the duties of a nursery governess in a large house in
the neighbourhood of Redhill.</p>
<p>"Will you kindly give me the name of that house?" interrupted
Loveday.</p>
<p>"Certainly; Wootton Hall, the place is called, and Annie Lee is
my sweetheart's name. I don't care who knows it!" He threw his head
back as he said this, as if he would be delighted to announce the
fact to the whole world. "Annie's mother," he went on, "died when
she was a baby, and we both thought her father was dead also, when
suddenly, about a fortnight ago, it came to her knowledge that
instead of being dead, he was serving his time at Portland for some
offence committed years ago."</p>
<p>"Do you know how this came to Annie's knowledge?"</p>
<p>"Not the least in the world; I only know that I suddenly got a
letter from her announcing the fact, and at the same time, breaking
off her engagement with me. I tore the letter into a thousand
pieces, and wrote back saying I would not allow the engagement to
be broken off, but would marry her to-morrow if she would have me.
To this letter she did not reply; there came instead a few lines
from Mrs. Copeland, the lady at Wootton Hall, saying that Annie had
thrown up her engagement and joined some Sisterhood, and that she,
Mrs. Copeland, had pledged her word to Annie to reveal to no one
the name and whereabouts of that Sisterhood."</p>
<p>"And I suppose you imagine I am able to do what Mrs. Copeland is
pledged not to do?"</p>
<p>"That's just it, Miss Brooke," cried the young man
enthusiastically. "You do such wonderful things; everyone knows you
do. It seems as if, when anything is wanted to be found out, you
just walk into a place, look round you and, in a moment, everything
becomes clear as noonday."</p>
<p>"I can't quite lay claim to such wonderful powers as that. As it
happens, however, in the present instance, no particular skill is
needed to find out what you wish to know, for I fancy I have
already come upon the traces of Miss Annie Lee."</p>
<p>"Miss Brooke!"</p>
<p>"Of course, I cannot say for certain, but is a matter you can
easily settle for yourself&mdash;settle, too, in a way that will
confer a great obligation on me."</p>
<p>"I shall be only too delighted to be of any&mdash;the slightest
service to you," cried White, enthusiastically as before.</p>
<p>"Thank you. I will explain. I came down here specially to watch
the movements of a certain Sisterhood who have somehow aroused the
suspicions of the police. Well, I find that instead of being able
to do this, I am myself so closely watched&mdash;possibly by
confederates of these Sisters&mdash;that unless I can do my work by
deputy I may as well go back to town at once."</p>
<p>"Ah! I see&mdash;you want me to be that deputy."</p>
<p>"Precisely. I want you to go to the room in Redhill that I have
hired, take your place at the window&mdash;screened, of course,
from observation&mdash;at which I ought to be seated&mdash;watch as
closely as possible the movements of these Sisters and report them
to me at the hotel, where I shall remain shut in from morning till
night&mdash;it is the only way in which I can throw my persistent
spies off the scent. Now, in doing this for me, you will be also
doing yourself a good turn, for I have little doubt but what under
the blue serge hood of one of the sisters you will discover the
pretty face of Miss Annie Lee."</p>
<p>As they had talked they had walked, and now stood on the top of
the hill at the head of the one little street that constituted the
whole of the village of Northfield.</p>
<p>On their left hand stood the village schools and the master's
house; nearly facing these, on the opposite side of the road,
beneath a clump of elms, stood the village pound. Beyond this
pound, on either side of the way, were two rows of small cottages
with tiny squares of garden in front, and in the midst of these
small cottages a swinging sign beneath a lamp announced a "Postal
and Telegraph Office."</p>
<p>"Now that we have come into the land of habitations again," said
Loveday, "it will be best for us to part. It will not do for you
and me to be seen together, or my spies will be transferring their
attentions from me to you, and I shall have to find another deputy.
You had better start on your bicycle for Redhill at once, and I
will walk back at leisurely speed. Come to me at my hotel without
fail at one o'clock and report proceedings. I do not say anything
definite about remuneration, but I assure you, if you carry out my
instructions to the letter, your services will be amply rewarded by
me and by my employers."</p>
<p>There were yet a few more details to arrange. White had been, he
said, only a day and night in the neighbourhood, and special
directions as to the locality had to be given to him. Loveday
advised him not to attract attention by going to the draper's
private door, but to enter the shop as if he were a customer, and
then explain matters to Mrs. Golightly, who, no doubt, would be in
her place behind the counter; tell her he was the brother of the
Miss Smith who had hired her room, and ask permission to go through
the shop to that room, as he had been commissioned by his sister to
read and answer any letters that might have arrived there for
her.</p>
<p>"Show her the key of the side door&mdash;here it is," said
Loveday; "it will be your credentials, and tell her you did not
like to make use of it without acquainting her with the fact."</p>
<p>The young man took the key, endeavoured to put it in his
waistcoat pocket, found the space there occupied and so transferred
it to the keeping of a side pocket in his tunic.</p>
<p>All this time Loveday stood watching him.</p>
<p>"You have a capital machine there," she said, as the young man
mounted his bicycle once more, "and I hope you will turn it to
account in following the movements of these Sisters about the
neighbourood. I feel confident you will have something definite to
tell me when you bring me your first report at one o'clock."</p>
<p>White once more broke into a profusion of thanks, and then,
lifting his cap to the lady, started his machine at a fairly good
pace.</p>
<p>Loveday watched him out of sight down the slope of the hill,
then, instead of following him as she had said she would "at a
leisurely pace," she turned her steps in the opposite direction
along the village street.</p>
<p>It was an altogether ideal country village. Neatly-dressed
chubby-faced children, now on their way to the schools, dropped
quaint little curtsies, or tugged at curly locks as Loveday passed;
every cottage looked the picture of cleanliness and trimness, and
although so late in the year, the gardens were full of late
flowering chrysanthemums and early flowering Christmas roses.</p>
<p>At the end of the village, Loveday came suddenly into view of a
large, handsome, red-brick mansion. It presented a wide frontage to
the road, from which it lay back amid extensive pleasure grounds.
On the right hand, and a little in the rear of the house, stood
what seemed to be large and commodious stables, and immediately
adjoining these stables was a low-built, red-brick shed, that had
evidently been recently erected.</p>
<p>That low-build, red-brick shed excited Loveday's curiosity.</p>
<p>"Is this house called North Cape?" she asked of a man, who
chanced at that moment to be passing with a pickaxe and shovel.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="500" height=
"314" src="1302211h-images/25.gif"><br>
NORTH CAPE HOUSE.</p>
<p>The man answered in the affirmative, and Loveday then asked
another question: could he tell her what was that small shed so
close to the house&mdash;it looked like a glorified
cowhouse&mdash;now what could be its use?</p>
<p>The man's face lighted up as if it were a subject on which he
liked to be questioned. He explained that that small shed was the
engine-house where the electricity that lighted North Cape was made
and stored. Then he dwelt with pride upon the fact, as if he held a
personal interest in it, that North Cape was the only house, far or
near, that was thus lighted.</p>
<p>"I suppose the wires are carried underground to the house," said
Loveday, looking in vain for signs of them anywhere.</p>
<p>The man was delighted to go into details on the matter. He had
helped to lay those wires, he said: they were two in number, one
for supply and one for return, and were laid three feet below
ground, in boxes filled with pitch. These wires were switched on to
jars in the engine-house, where the electricity was stored, and,
after passing underground, entered the family mansion under its
flooring at its western end.</p>
<p>Loveday listened attentively to these details, and then took a
minute and leisurely survey of the house and its surroundings. This
done, she retraced her steps through the village, pausing, however,
at the "Postal and Telegraph Office" to dispatch a telegram to
Inspector Gunning.</p>
<p>It was one to send the Inspector to his cipher-book. It ran as
follows:</p>
<p>"Rely solely on chemist and coal-merchant throughout the
day.&mdash;L. B."</p>
<p>After this, she quickened her pace, and in something over
three-quarters of an hour was back again at her hotel.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="332" height=
"473" src="1302211h-images/26.gif"><br>
THERE WAS TO BE A MEETING OF THE "SURREY STAGS."</p>
<p>There she found more of life stirring than when she had quitted
it in the early morning. There was to be a meeting of the "Surrey
Stags," about a couple of miles off, and a good many hunting men
were hanging about the entrance to the house, discussing the
chances of sport after last night's frost. Loveday made her way
through the throng in leisurely fashion, and not a man but what had
keen scrutiny from her sharp eyes. No, there was no cause for
suspicion there: they were evidently one and all just what they
seemed to be&mdash;loud-voiced, hard-riding men, bent on a day's
sport; but&mdash;and here Loveday's eyes traveled beyond the hotel
court-yard to the other side of the road&mdash;who was that man
with a bill-hook hacking at the hedge there&mdash;a thin-featured,
round-shouldered old fellow, with a bent-about hat? It might be as
well not to take it too rashly for granted that her spies had
withdrawn, and had left her free to do her work in her own
fashion.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="286" height=
"385" src="1302211h-images/28.gif"><br>
THAT MAN WITH A BILL-HOOK.</p>
<p>She went upstairs to her room. It was situated on the first
floor in the front of the house, and consequently commanded a good
view of the high road. She stood well back from the window, and at
an angle whence she could see and not be seen, took a long, steady
survey of the hedger. And the longer she looked the more convinced
she was that the man's real work was something other than the
bill-hook seemed to imply. He worked, so to speak, with his head
over his shoulder, and when Loveday supplemented her eyesight with
a strong field-glass, she could see more than one stealthy glance
shot from beneath his bent-about hat in the direction of her
window.</p>
<p>There could be little doubt about it: her movements were to be
as closely watched to-day as they had been yesterday. Now it was of
first importance that she should communicate with Inspector Gunning
in the course of the afternoon: the question to solve was how it
was to be done?</p>
<p>To all appearance Loveday answered the question in extraordinary
fashion. She pulled up her blind, she drew back her curtain, and
seated herself, in full view, at a small table in the window
recess. Then she took a pocket inkstand from her pocket, a packet
or correspondence cards from her letter-case, and with rapid pen,
set to work on them.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="329" height=
"385" src="1302211h-images/27.gif"><br>
SEATED HERSELF IN FULL VIEW.</p>
<p>About an hour and a half afterwards, White, coming in, according
to his promise, to report proceedings, found her still seated at
the window, not, however, with writing materials before her, but
with needle and thread in her hand with which she was mending her
gloves.</p>
<p>"I return to town by the first train to-morrow morning," she
said as he entered, "and I find these wretched things want no end
of stitches. Now for your report."</p>
<p>White appeared to be in an elated frame of mind. "I've seen
her!" he cried, "my Annie&mdash;they've got her, those confounded
Sisters; but they sha'n't keep her&mdash;no, not if I have to pull
the house down about their ears to get her out."</p>
<p>"Well, now you know where she is, you can take your time about
getting her out," said Loveday. "I hope, however, you haven't
broken faith with me, and betrayed yourself by trying to speak with
her, because, if so, I shall have to look out for another
deputy."</p>
<p>"Honour, Miss Brooke!" answered White indignantly. "I stuck to
my duty, though it cost me something to see her hanging over those
kids and tucking them into the cart, and never say a word to her,
never so much as wave my hand."</p>
<p>"Did she go out with the donkey-cart to-day?"</p>
<p>"No, she only tucked the kids into the cart with a blanket, and
then went back to the house. Two old Sisters, ugly as sin, went out
with them. I watched them from the window, jolt, jolt, jolt, round
the corner, out of sight, and then I whipped down the stairs, and
on to my machine, and was after them in a trice and managed to keep
them well in sight for over an hour and a half."</p>
<p>"And their destination to-day was?"</p>
<p>"Wootton Hall."</p>
<p>"Ah, just as I expected."</p>
<p>"Just as you expected?" echoed White.</p>
<p>"I forgot. You do not know the nature of the suspicions that are
attached to this Sisterhood, and the reasons I have for thinking
that Wootton Hall, at this season of the year, might have an
especial attraction for them."</p>
<p>White continued staring at her. "Miss Brooke," he said
presently, in an altered tone, "whatever suspicions may attach to
the Sisterhood, I'll stake my life on it, my Annie has had no share
in any wickedness of any sort."</p>
<p>"Oh, quite so; it is most likely that your Annie has, in some
way, been inveigled into joining these Sisters&mdash;has been taken
possession of by them, in fact, just as they have taken possession
of the little cripples."</p>
<p>"That's it!" he cried excitedly; "that was the idea that
occurred to me when you spoke to me on the hill about them,
otherwise you may be sure&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Did they get relief of any sort at the Hall?" interrupted
Loveday..</p>
<p>"Yes; one of the two ugly old women stopped outside the lodge
gates with the donkey-cart, and the other beauty went up to the
house alone. She stayed there, I should think, about a quarter of
an hour, and when she came back, was followed by a servant,
carrying a bundle and a basket."</p>
<p>"Ah! I've no doubt they brought away with them something else
beside old garments and broken victuals."</p>
<p>White stood in front of her, fixing a hard, steady gaze upon
her.</p>
<p>"Miss Brooke," he said presently, in a voice that matched the
look on his face, "what do you suppose was the real object of these
women in going to Wootton Hall this morning?"</p>
<p>"Mr. White, if I wished to help a gang of thieves break into
Wootton Hall tonight, don't you think I should be greatly
interested in procuring from them the information that the master
of the house was away from home; that two of the men servants, who
slept in the house, had recently been dismissed and their places
had not yet been filled; also that the dogs were never unchained at
night, and that their kennels were at the side of the house at
which the butler's pantry is not situated? These are particulars I
have gathered in this house without stirring from my chair, and I
am satisfied that they are likely to be true. A the same time, if I
were a professed burglar, I should not be content with information
that was likely to be true, but would be careful to procure such
that was certain to be true, and so would set accomplices to work
at the fountain head. Now do you understand?"</p>
<p>White folded his arms and looked down on her.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do?" he asked, in short, brusque
tones.</p>
<p>Loveday looked him full in the face. "Communicate with the
police immediately," she answered; "and I should feel greatly
obliged if you will at once take a note from me to Inspector
Gunning at Reigate."</p>
<p>"And what becomes of Annie?"</p>
<p>"I don't think you need have any anxiety on that head. I've no
doubt that when the circumstances of her admission to the
Sisterhood are investigated, it will be proved that she has been as
much deceived and imposed upon as the man, John Murray, who so
foolishly let his house to these women. Remember, Annie has Mrs.
Copeland's good word to support her integrity."</p>
<p>White stood silent for awhile.</p>
<p>"What sort of a note do you wish me to take to the Inspector?"
he presently asked.</p>
<p>"You shall read it as I write it, if you like," answered
Loveday. She took a correspondence card from her letter case, and,
with an indelible pencil, wrote as follows&mdash;</p>
<p>"Wooton Hall is threatened to-night&mdash;concentrate attention
there.</p>
<p align="right">"L. B."</p>
<p>White read the words as she wrote them with a curious expression
passing over his handsome features.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, curtly as before. "I'll deliver that, I give you
my word, but I'll bring back no answer to you. I'll do no more
spying for you&mdash;it's a trade that doesn't suit me. There's a
straight-forward way of doing straight-forward work, and I'll take
that way&mdash;no other&mdash;to get my Annie out of that den."</p>
<p>He took the note, which she sealed and handed to him, and strode
out of the room.</p>
<p>Loveday, from the window, watched him mount his bicycle. Was it
her fancy, or did there pass a swift, furtive glance of recognition
between him and the hedger on the other side of the way as he rode
out of the court-yard?</p>
<p>Loveday seemed determined to make that hedger's work easy for
him. The short winter's day was closing in now, and her room must
consequently have been growing dim to outside observation. She
lighted the gas chandelier which hung from the ceiling and, still
with blinds and curtains undrawn, took her old place at the window,
spread writing materials before her and commenced a long and
elaborate report to her chief at Lynch Court.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="237" height=
"507" src="1302211h-images/29.gif"><br>
SHE LIGHTED THE GAS.</p>
<p>About half-an-hour afterwards, as she threw a casual glance
across the road, she saw that the hedger had disappeared, but that
two ill-looking tramps sat munching bread and cheese under the
hedge to which his bill-hook had done so little service. Evidently
the intention was, one way or another, not to lose sight of her so
long as she remained in Redhill.</p>
<p>Meantime, White had delivered Loveday's note to the Inspector at
Reigate, and had disappeared on his bicycle once more.</p>
<p>Gunning read it without a change of expression. Then he crossed
the room to the fire-place and held the card as close to the bars
as he could without scorching it.</p>
<p>"I had a telegram from her this morning," he explained to his
confidential man, "telling me to rely upon chemicals and coals
throughout the day, and that, of course, meant that she would write
to me in invisible ink. No doubt this message about Wootton Hall
means nothing&mdash;"</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly, exclaiming: "Eh! what's this!" as, having
withdrawn the card from the fire, Loveday's real message stood out
in bold, clear characters between the lines of the false one.</p>
<p>Thus it ran:</p>
<p>"North Cape will be attacked to-night&mdash;a desperate
gang&mdash;be prepared for a struggle. Above all, guard the
electrical engine-house. On no account attempt to communicate with
me; I am so closely watched that any endeavour to do so may
frustrate your chance of trapping the scoundrels. L. B."</p>
<p>That night when the moon went down behind Reigate Hill an
exciting scene was enacted at "North Cape." The <i>Surrey
Gazette</i>, in its issue the following day, gave the subjoined
account of it under the heading, "Desperate encounter with
burglars."</p>
<p>"Last night, 'North Cape,' the residence of Mr. Jameson, was the
scene of an affray between the police and a desperate gang of
burglars. 'North Cape' is lighted throughout with electricity, and
the burglars, four in number, divided in half&mdash;two being told
off to enter and rob the house, and two to remain at the
engine-shed, where the electricity is stored, so that, at a given
signal, should need arise, the wires might be unswitched, the
inmates of the house thrown into sudden darkness and confusion, and
the escape of the marauders thereby facilitated. Mr. Jameson,
however, had received timely warning from the police of the
intended attack, and he, with his two sons, all well armed, sat in
darkness in the inner hall awaiting the coming of the thieves. The
police were stationed, some in the stables, some in out-buildings
nearer to the house, and others in more distant parts of the
grounds. The burglars effected their entrance by means of a ladder
placed to a window of the servants' stair case which leads straight
down to the butler's pantry and to the safe where the silver is
kept. The fellows, however, had no sooner got into the house than
the police issuing from their hiding-place outside, mounted the
ladder after them and thus cut off their retreat. Mr. Jameson and
his two sons, at the same moment, attacked them in front, and thus
overwhelmed by numbers, the scoundrels were easily secured. It was
at the engine-house outside that the sharpest struggle took place.
The thieves had forced open the door of this engine-shed with their
jimmies immediately on their arrival, under the very eyes of the
police, who lay in ambush in the stables, and when one of the men,
captured in the house, contrived to sound an alarm on his whistle,
these outside watchers made a rush for the electrical jars, in
order to unswitch the wires. Upon this the police closed upon them,
and a hand-to-hand struggle followed, and if it had not been for
the timely assistance of Mr. Jameson and his sons, who had
fortunately conjectured that their presence here might be useful,
it is more than likely that one of the burglars, a powerfully-built
man, would have escaped.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="295" height=
"384" src="1302211h-images/30.gif"><br>
A HAND-TO-HAND STRUGGLE.</p>
<p>"The names of the captured men are John Murray, Arthur and
George Lee (father and son), and a man with so many aliases that it
is difficult to know which is his real name. The whole thing had
been most cunningly and carefully planned. The elder Lee, lately
released from penal servitude for a similar offence, appears to
have been prime mover in the affair. This man had, it seems, a son
and a daughter, who, through the kindness of friends, had been
fairly well placed in life: the son at an electrical engineers' in
London, the daughter as nursery governess at Wootton Hall. Directly
this man was released from Portland, he seems to have found out his
children and done his best to ruin them both. He was constantly at
Wootton Hall endeavouring to induce his daughter to act as an
accomplice to a robbery of the house. This so worried the girl that
she threw up her situation and joined a Sisterhood that had
recently been established in the neighbourhood. Upon this, Lee's
thoughts turned in another direction. He induced his son, who had
saved a little money, to throw up his work in London, and join him
in his disreputable career. The boy is a handsome young fellow, but
appears to have in him the makings of a first-class criminal. In
his work as an electrical engineer he had made the acquaintance of
the man John Murray, who, it is said, has been rapidly going
downhill of late. Murray was the owner of the house rented by the
Sisterhood that Miss Lee had joined, and the idea evidently struck
the brains of these three scoundrels that this Sisterhood, whose
antecedents were a little mysterious, might be utilized to draw off
the attention of the police from themselves and from the especial
house in the neighbourhood that they had planned to attack. With
this end in view, Murray made an application to the police to have
the Sisters watched, and still further to give colour to the
suspicions he had endeavoured to set afloat concerning them, he and
his confederates made feeble attempts at burglary upon the houses
at which the Sisters had called, begging for scraps. It is a matter
for congratulation that the plot, from beginning to end, has been
thus successfully unearthed, and it is felt on all sides that great
credit is due to Inspector Gunning and his skilled coadjutors for
the vigilance and promptitude they have displayed throughout the
affair."</p>
<p>Loveday read aloud this report, with her feet on the fender of
the Lynch Court office.</p>
<p>"Accurate, as far as it goes," she said, as she laid down the
paper.</p>
<p>"But we want to know a little more," said Mr. Dyer. "In the
first place, I would like to know what it was that diverted your
suspicions from the unfortunate Sisters?"</p>
<p>"The way in which they handled the children," answered Loveday
promptly. "I have seen female criminals of all kinds handling
children, and I have noticed that although they may
occasionally&mdash;even this is rare&mdash;treat them with a
certain rough sort of kindness, of tenderness they are utterly
incapable. Now Sister Monica, I must admit, is not pleasant to look
at; at the same time, there was something absolutely beautiful in
the way in which she lifted the little cripple out of the cart, put
his tiny thin hand round her neck, and carried him into the house.
By-the-way I would like to ask some rapid physiognolmist how he
would account for Sister Monica's repulsiveness of feature as
contrasted with young Lee's undoubted good looks&mdash;heredity, in
this case, throws no light on the matter."</p>
<p>"Another question," said Mr. Dyer, not paying much heed to
Loveday's digression: "how was it you transferred your suspicions
to John Murray?"</p>
<p>"I did not do so immediately, although at the very first it had
struck me as odd that he should be so anxious to do the work of the
police for them. The chief thing I noticed concerning Murray, on
the first and only occasion on which I saw him, was that he had had
an accident with his bicycle, for in the right-hand corner of his
lamp-glass there was a tiny star, and the lamp itself had a dent on
the same side, had also lost its hook, and was fastened to the
machine by a bit of electric fuse. The next morning as I was
walking up the hill towards Northfield, I was accosted by a young
man mounted on that self-same bicycle&mdash;not a doubt of
it&mdash;star in glass, dent, fuse, all three."</p>
<p>"Ah, that sounded an important keynote, and led you to connect
Murray and the younger Lee immediately."</p>
<p>"It did, and, of course, also at once gave the lie to his
statement that he was a stranger in the place, and confirmed my
opinion that there was nothing of the north-countryman in his
accent. Other details in his manner and appearance gave rise to
other suspicions. For instance, he called himself a press reporter
by profession, and his hands were coarse and grimy as only a
mechanic's could be. He said he was a bit of a literary man, but
the Tennyson that showed so obtrusively from his pocket was new,
and in parts uncut, and totally unlike the well-thumbed volume of
the literary student. Finally, when he tried and failed to put my
latch-key into his waistcoat pocket, I saw the reason lay in the
fact that the pocket was already occupied by a soft coil of
electric fuse, the end of which protruded. Now, an electric fuse is
what an electrical engineer might almost unconsciously carry about
with him, it is so essential a part of his working tools, but it is
a thing that a literary man or a press reporter could have no
possible use for."</p>
<p>"Exactly, exactly. And it was no doubt, that bit of electric
fuse that turned your thoughts to the one house in the
neighbourhood lighted by electricity, and suggested to your mind
the possibility of electrical engineers turning their talents to
account in that direction. Now, will you tell me, what, at that
stage of your day's work, induced you to wire to Gunning that you
would bring your invisible-ink bottle into use?"</p>
<p>"That was simply a matter or precaution; it did not compel me to
the use of invisible ink, if I saw other safe methods of
communication. I felt myself being hemmed in on all sides with
spies, and I could not tell what emergency might arise. I don't
think I have ever had a more difficult game to play. As I walked
and talked with the young fellow up the hill, it became clear to me
that if I wished to do my work I must lull the suspicions of the
gang, and seem to walk into their trap. I saw by the persistent way
in which Wootton Hall was forced on my notice that it was wished to
fix my suspicions there. I accordingly, to all appearance, did so,
and allowed the fellows to think they were making a fool of
me."</p>
<p>"Ha! ha! Capital that&mdash;the biter bit, with a vengeance!
Splendid idea to make that young rascal himself deliver the letter
that was to land him and his pals in jail. And he all the time
laughing in his sleeve and thinking what a fool he was making of
you! Ha, ha, ha!" And Mr. Dyer made the office ring again with his
merriment.</p>
<p>"The only person one is at all sorry for in this affair is poor
little Sister Anna," said Loveday pityingly; "and yet, perhaps, all
things considered, after her sorry experience of life, she may not
be so badly placed in a Sisterhood where practical
Christianity&mdash;not religious hysterics&mdash;is the one and
only rule of the order."</p>
<hr width="15%" align="center">
<h3 align="center"><a name="IV" id="IV"><i>A PRINCESS'S
VENGEANCE.</i></a></h3>
<p>"T<small>HE</small> girl is young, pretty, friendless and a
foreigner, you say, and has disappeared as completely as if the
earth had opened to receive her," said Miss Brooke, making a r?sum?
of the facts that Mr. Dyer had been relating to her. "Now, will you
tell me why two days were allowed to elapse before the police were
communicated with?"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Druce, the lady to whom Lucie Cunier acted as amanuensis,"
answered Mr. Dyer, "took the matter very calmly at first and said
she felt sure that the girl would write to her in a day or so,
explaining her extraordinary conduct. Major Druce, her son, the
gentleman who came to me this morning, was away from home, on a
visit, when the girl took flight. Immediately on his return,
however, he communicated the fullest particulars to the
police."</p>
<p>"They do not seem to have taken up the case very heartily at
Scotland Yard."</p>
<p>"No, they have as good as dropped it. They advised Major Druce
to place the matter in my hands, saying that they considered it a
case for private rather than police investigation."</p>
<p>"I wonder what made them come to that conclusion."</p>
<p>"I think I can tell you, although the Major seemed quite at a
loss on the matter. It seems he had a photograph of the missing
girl, which he kept in a drawer of his writing-table. (By-the-way,
I think the young man is a good deal 'gone' on this Mdlle. Cunier,
in spite of his engagement to another lady.) Well, this portrait he
naturally thought would be most useful in helping to trace the
girl, and he went to his drawer for it, intending to take it with
him to Scotland Yard. To his astonishment, however, it was nowhere
to be seen, and, although he at once instituted a rigorous search,
and questioned his mother and the servants, one and all, on the
matter, it was all to no purpose."</p>
<p>Loveday thought for a moment.</p>
<p>"Well, of course," she said presently "that photograph must have
been stolen by someone in the house, and, equally of course, that
someone must know more on the matter than he or she cares to avow,
and, most probably, has some interest in throwing obstacles in the
way of tracing the girl. At the same time, however, the fact in no
way disproves the possibility that a crime, and a very black one,
may underlie the girl's disappearance."</p>
<p>"The Major himself appears confident that a crime of some sort
has been committed, and he grew very excited and a little mixed in
his statements more than once just now."</p>
<p>"What sort of woman is the Major's mother?"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Druce? She is rather a well-known personage in certain
sets. Her husband died about ten years ago, and since his death she
has posed as promoter and propagandist of all sorts of benevolent,
though occasionally somewhat visionary ideas; theatrical missions,
magic-lantern and playing cards missions, societies for providing
perpetual music for the sick poor, for supplying cabmen with
comforters, and a hundred other similar schemes have in turn
occupied her attention. Her house is a rendezvous for faddists of
every description. The latest fad, however, seems to have put all
others to flight; it is a scheme for alleviating the condition of
'our sisters in the East,' so she puts it in her prospectus; in
other words a Harem Mission on somewhat similar, but I suppose
broader lines than the old-fashioned Zenana Mission. This Harem
Mission has gathered about her a number of Turkish and Egyptian
potentates resident in or visiting London, and has thus
incidentally brought about the engagement of her son, Major Druce,
with the Princess Dullah-Veih. This Princess is a beauty and an
heiress, and although of Turkish parentage, has been brought up
under European influence in Cairo."</p>
<p>"Is anything known of the antecedents of Mdlle. Cunier?"</p>
<p>"Very little. She came to Mrs. Druce from a certain Lady Gwynne,
who had brought her to England from an orphanage for the daughters
of jewellers and watchmakers at Echallets, in Geneva. Lady Gwynne
intended to make her governess to her young children, but when she
saw that the girl's good looks had attracted her husband's
attention, she thought better of it, and suggested to Mrs. Druce
that Mademoiselle might be useful to her in conducting her foreign
correspondence. Mrs. Druce accordingly engaged the young lady to
act as her secretary and amanuensis, and appears, on the whole, to
have taken to the girl, and to have been on a pleasant, friendly
footing with her. I wonder if the Princess Dullah-Veih was on an
equally pleasant footing with her when she saw, as no doubt she
did, the attention she received at the Major's hands." (Mr. Dyer
shrugged his shoulders.) "The Major's suspicions do not point in
that direction, in spite of the fact which I elicited from him by
judicious questioning, that the Princess has a violent and jealous
temper, and has at times made his life a burden to him. His
suspicions centre solely upon a certain Hafiz Cassimi, son of the
Turkish-Egyptian banker of that name. It was at the house of these
Cassimis that the Major first met the Princess, and he states that
she and young Cassimi are like brother and sister to each other. He
says that this young man has had the run of his mother's house and
made himself very much at home in it for the past three weeks, ever
since, in fact, the Princess came to stay with Mrs. Druce, in order
to be initiated into the mysteries of English family life. Hafiz
Cassimi, according to the Major's account, fell desperately in love
with the little Swiss girl almost at first sight and pestered her
with his attentions, and off and on there appear to have passed hot
words between the two young men."</p>

MDLLE. CUNIER.</p>
<p>"One could scarcely expect a princess with Eastern blood in her
veins to be a quiet and passive spectator to such a drama of
cross-purposes."</p>
<p>"Scarcely. The Major, perhaps, hardly takes the Princess
sufficiently into his reckoning. According to him, young Cassimi is
a thorough-going Iago, and he begs me to concentrate attention
entirely on him. Cassimi, he says, has stolen the photograph.
Cassimi has inveigled the girl out of the house on some
pretext&mdash;perhaps out of the country also, and he suggests that
it might be as well to communicate with the police at Cairo, with
as little delay as possible."</p>
<p>"And it hasn't so much as entered his mind that his Princess
might have a hand in such a plot as that!"</p>
<p>"Apparently not. I think I told you that Mademoiselle had taken
no luggage&mdash;not so much as a hand-bag&mdash;with her. Nothing,
beyond her coat and hat, has disappeared from her wardrobe. Her
writing-desk, and, in fact, all her boxes and drawers, have been
opened and searched, but no letters or papers of any sort have been
found that throw any light upon her movements."</p>
<p>"At what hour in the day is the girl supposed to have left the
house?"</p>
<p>"No one can say for certain. It is conjectured that it was some
time in the afternoon of the second of this month&mdash;a week ago
to-day. It was one of Mrs. Druce's big reception days, and with a
stream of people going and coming, a young lady, more or less,
leaving the house would scarcely be noticed."</p>
<p>"I suppose," said Loveday, after a moment's pause, "this
Princess Dullah-Veih has something of a history. One does not often
get a Turkish princess in London."</p>
<p>"Yes, she has a history. She is only remotely connected with the
present reigning dynasty in Turkey, and I dare say her
princess-ship has been made the most of. All the same, however, she
has had an altogether exceptional career for an Oriental lady. She
was left an orphan at an early age, and was consigned to the
guardianship of the elder Cassimi by her relatives. The Cassimis,
both father and son, seem to be very advanced and European in their
ideas, and by them she was taken to Cairo for her education. About
a year ago they 'brought her out' in London, where she made the
acquaintance of Major Druce. The young man, by-the-way, appears to
be rather hot-headed in his love-making, for within six weeks of
his introduction to her their engagement was announced. No doubt it
had Mrs. Druce's fullest approval, for knowing her son's
extravagant habits and his numerous debts, it must have been patent
to her that a rich wife was a necessity to him. The marriage, I
believe, was to have taken place this season; but taking into
consideration the young man's ill-advised attentions to the little
Swiss girl, and the fervour he is throwing into the search for her,
I should say it was exceedingly doubtful whether&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Major Druce, sir, wishes to see you," said a clerk at that
moment, opening the door leading from the outer office.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="217" height=
"401" src="1302211h-images/33.gif"><br>
"MAJOR DRUCE, SIR!"</p>
<p>"Very good; show him in," said Mr. Dyer. Then he turned to
Loveday.</p>
<p>"Of course I have spoken to him about you, and he is very
anxious to take you to his mother's reception this afternoon, so
that you may have a look round and&mdash;"</p>
<p>He broke off, having to rise and greet Major Druce, who at that
moment entered the room.</p>
<p>He was a tall, handsome young fellow of about seven or eight and
twenty, "well turned out" from head to foot, moustache waxed,
orchid in button-hole, light kid gloves, and patent leather boots.
There was assuredly nothing in his appearance to substantiate his
statement to Mr. Dyer that he "hadn't slept a wink all night, that
in fact another twenty-four hours of this terrible suspense would
send him into his grave."</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer introduced Miss Brooke, and she expressed her sympathy
with him on the painful matter that was filling his thoughts.</p>
<p>"It is very good of you, I'm sure," he replied, in a slow, soft
drawl, not unpleasant to listen to. "My mother receives this
afternoon from half past four to half past six, and I shall be very
glad if you will allow me to introduce you to the inside of our
house, and to the very ill-looking set that we have somehow managed
to gather about us."</p>
<p>"The ill-looking set?"</p>
<p>"Yes; Jews, Turks, heretics and infidels&mdash;all there. And
they're on the increase too, that's the worst of it. Every week a
fresh importation from Cairo."</p>
<p>"Ah, Mrs. Druce is a large-hearted, benevolent woman,"
interposed Mr. Dyer; "all nationalities gather within her
walls."</p>
<p>"Was your mother a large-hearted, benevolent woman?" said the
young man, turning upon him. "No! well then, thank Providence that
she wasn't; and admit that you know nothing at all on the matter.
Miss Brooke," he continued, turning to Loveday, "I've brought round
my hansom for you; it's nearly half past four now, and it's a good
twenty minutes' drive from here to Portland Place. If you're ready,
I'm at your service."</p>
<p>Major Druce's hansom was, like himself, in all respects "well
turned out," and the India rubber tires round its wheels allowed an
easy flow of conversation to be kept up during the twenty minutes'
drive from Lynch Court to Portland Place.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="263" height=
"370" src="1302211h-images/34.gif"><br>
MAJOR DRUCE'S HANSOM.</p>
<p>The Major led off the talk in frank and easy fashion.</p>
<p>"My mother," he said, "prides herself on being cosmopolitan in
her tastes, and just now we are very cosmopolitan indeed. Even our
servants represent divers nationalities; the butler is French, the
two footmen Italians, the maids, I believe, are some of them
German, some Irish; and I've no doubt if you penetrated to the
kitchen-quarters, you'd find the staff there composed in part of
Scandinavians, in part of South Sea Islanders. The other quarters
of the globe you will find fully represented in the
drawing-room."</p>
<p>Loveday had a direct question to ask.</p>
<p>"Are you certain that Mdlle. Cunier had no friends in England?"
she said.</p>
<p>"Positive. She hadn't a friend in the world outside my mother's
four walls, poor child! She told me more than once that she was
'seule sur la terre.'" He broke off for a moment, as if overcome by
a sad memory, then added: "But I'll put a bullet into him, take my
word for it, if she isn't found within another twenty-four hours.
Personally I should prefer settling the brute in that fashion to
handing him over to the police."</p>
<p>His face flushed a deep red, there came a sudden flash to his
eye, but for all that, his voice was as soft and slow and
unemotional, as though he were talking of nothing more serious than
bringing down a partridge.</p>
<p>There fell a brief pause; then Loveday asked another
question.</p>
<p>"Is Mademoiselle Catholic or Protestant, can you tell me?"</p>
<p>The Major thought for a moment, then replied:</p>
<p>"'Pon my word, I don't know. She used sometimes to attend a
little charge in South Savile Street&mdash;I've walked with her
occasionally to the church door&mdash;but I couldn't for the life
of me say whether it was a Catholic, Protestant, or Pagan place of
worship. But&mdash;but you don't think those confounded priests
have&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Here, we are in Portland place," interrupted Loveday. "Mrs.
Druce's rooms are already full, to judge from that long line of
carriages!"</p>
<p>"Miss Brooke," said the Major suddenly, bethinking himself of
his responsibilities, "how am I to introduce you? what r?le will
you take up this afternoon? Pose as a faddist of some sort, if you
want to win my mother's heart. What do you say to having started a
grand scheme for supplying Hottentots and Kaffirs with eye-glasses?
My mother would swear eternal friendship with you at once."</p>
<p>"Don't introduce me at all at first," answered Loveday. "Get me
into some quiet corner, where I can see without being seen. Later
on in the afternoon, when I have had time to look round a little,
I'll tell you whether it will be necessary to introduce me or
not."</p>
<p>"It will be a mob this afternoon, and no mistake," said Major
Druce, as side by side, they entered the house. "Do you hear that
fizzing and clucking just behind us? That's Arabic; you'll get it
in whiffs between gusts of French and German all the afternoon. The
Egyptian contingent seems to be in full force to-day. I don't see
any Choctaw Indians, but no doubt they'll send their
representatives later on. Come in at this side door, and we'll work
our way round to that big palm. My mother is sure to be at the
principal doorway."</p>
<p>The drawing rooms were packed from end to end, and Major Druce's
progress, as he headed Loveday through the crowd, was impeded by
hand-shaking and the interchange of civilities with his mother's
guests.</p>
<p>Eventually the big palm standing in a Chinese cistern was
reached, and there, half screened from view by its graceful
branches, he placed a chair for Miss Brooke.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="257" height=
"382" src="1302211h-images/35.gif"><br>
BESIDE THE BIG PALM.</p>
<p>From this quiet nook, as now and again the crowd parted, Loveday
could command a fair view of both drawing-rooms.</p>
<p>"Don't attract attention to me by standing at my elbow," she
whispered to the Major.</p>
<p>He answered her whisper with another.</p>
<p>"There's the Beast&mdash;Iago, I mean," he said; "do you see
him? He's standing talking to that fair, handsome woman in pale
green, with a picture hat. She's Lady Gwynne. And there's my
mother, and there's Dolly&mdash;the Princess I mean&mdash;alone on
the sofa. Ah! you can't see her now for the crowd. Yes, I'll go,
but if you want me, just nod to me and I shall understand."</p>
<p>If was easy to see what had brought such a fashionable crowd to
Mrs. Druce's rooms that afternoon. Every caller, as soon as she had
shaken hands with the hostess, passed on to the Princess's sofa,
and there waited patiently till opportunity presented itself for an
introduction to her Eastern Highness.</p>
<p>Loveday found it impossible to get more than the merest glimpse
of her, and so transferred her attention to Mr. Hafiz Cassimi, who
had been referred to in such unceremonious language by Major
Druce.</p>
<p>He was a swarthy, well-featured man, with bold, black eyes, and
lips that had the habit of parting now and again, not to smile, but
as if for no other purpose than to show a double row of gleaming
white teeth. The European dress he wore seemed to accord ill with
the man; and Loveday could fancy that those black eyes and that
double row of white teeth would have shown to better advantage
beneath a turban or a fez cap. From Cassimi, her eye wandered to
Mrs. Druce&mdash;a tall, stout woman, dressed in black velvet, and
with hair mounted high on her head, that had the appearance of
being either bleached or powdered. She gave Loveday the impression
of being that essentially modern product of modern
society&mdash;the woman who combines in one person the hard-working
philanthropist with the hard-working woman of fashion. As arrivals
began to slacken, she left her post near the door and began to make
the round of the room. From snatches of talk that came to her where
she sat, Loveday could gather that with one hand, as it were, this
energetic lady was organizing a grand charity concert, and with the
other pushing the interests of a big ball that was shortly to be
given by the officers of her son's regiment.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="151" height=
"337" src="1302211h-images/36.gif"><br>
MRS. DRUCE.</p>
<p>It was a hot June day. In spite of closed blinds and open
windows, the rooms were stifling to a degree. The butler, a small
dark, slight Frenchman, made his way through the throng to a window
at Loveday's right hand, to see if a little more air could be
admitted.</p>
<p>Major Druce followed on his heels to Loveday's side.</p>
<p>"Will you come into the next room and have some tea?" he asked;
"I'm sure you must feel nearly suffocated here." He broke off, then
added in a lower tone: "I hope you have kept your eyes on the
Beast. Did you ever in your life see a more repulsive-looking
animal?"</p>
<p>Loveday took his questions in their order.</p>
<p>"No tea, thank you," she said, "but I shall be glad if you will
tell your butler to bring me a glass of water&mdash;there he is, at
your elbow. Yes, off and on I have been studying Mr. Cassimi, and I
must admit I do not like his smileless smile."</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="140" height=
"359" src="1302211h-images/37.gif"><br>
MR. CASSIMI.</p>
<p>The butler brought the water. The Major, much to his annoyance,
was seized upon simultaneously by two ladies, one eager to know if
any tidings had been received of Mdlle. Cunier, the other anxious
to learn if a distinguished president to the Harem Mission had been
decided upon.</p>
<p>Soon after six the rooms began to thin somewhat, and
presentations to the Princess ceasing, Loveday was able to get a
full view of her.</p>
<p>She presented a striking picture, seated, half-reclining, on a
sofa, with two white-robed, dark-skinned Egyptian maidens standing
behind it. A more unfortunate sobriquet than "Dolly" could scarcely
have been found by the Major for this Oriental beauty, with her
olive complexion, her flashing eyes and extravagant richness of
attire.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="251" height=
"360" src="1302211h-images/31.gif"><br>
THE PRINCESS HALF-RECLINING ON A SOFA, WITH TWO WHITE-ROBED
EGYPTIAN MAIDENS BEHIND.</p>
<p>"'Queen of Sheba' would be far more appropriate," thought
Loveday. "She turns the commonplace sofa into a throne, and, I
should say, makes every one of those ladies feel as if she ought to
have donned court dress and plumes for the occasion."</p>
<p>It was difficult for her, from where she sat, to follow the
details of the Princess's dress. She could only see that a quantity
of soft orange-tinted silk was wound about the upper part of her
arms and fell from her shoulders like drooping wings, and that here
and there jewels flashed out from its folds. Her thick black hair
was loosely knotted, and kept in its place by jeweled pins and a
bandeau of pearls; and similar bandeaus adored her slender throat
and wrists.</p>
<p>"Are you lost in admiration?" said the Major, once more at her
elbow, in a slightly sarcastic tone. "That sort of thing is very
taking and effective at first, but after a time&mdash;"</p>
<p>He did not finish his sentence, shrugged his shoulders and
walked away. Half-past six chimed from a small clock on a bracket.
Carriage after carriage was rolling away from the door now, and
progress on the stairs was rendered difficult by a descending
crowd.</p>
<p>A quarter to seven struck, the last hand-shaking had been gone
through, and Mrs. Druce, looking hot and tired, had sunk into a
chair at the Princess's right hand, bending slightly forward to
render conversation with her easy.</p>
<p>On the Princess's left hand, Lady Gwynne had taken a chair, and
sat in converse with Hafiz Cassimi, who stood beside her.</p>
<p>Evidently these four were on very easy and intimate terms with
each other. Lady Gwynne had tossed her big picture hat on a chair
at her left hand, and was fanning herself with a palm-leaf. Mrs.
Druce, beckoning to the butler, desired him to bring them some
claret-cup from the refreshment-room.</p>
<p>No one seemed to observe Loveday seated still in her nook beside
the big palm.</p>
<p>She signaled to the Major, who stood looking discontentedly from
one of the windows.</p>
<p>"That is a most interesting group," she said; "now, if you like,
you may introduce me to your mother."</p>
<p>"Oh, with pleasure&mdash;under what name?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Under my own," she answered, "and please be very distinct in
pronouncing it, raise your voice slightly so that every one of
those persons may hear it. And then, please add my profession, and
say I am here at your request to investigate the circumstances
connected with Mdlle. Cunier's disappearance."</p>
<p>Major Druce looked astounded.</p>
<p>"But&mdash;but," he stammered, "have you seen
anything&mdash;found out anything? If not, don't you think it will
be better to preserve your incognita a little longer."</p>
<p>"Don't stop to ask questions," said Loveday sharply; "now, this
very minute, do what I ask you, or the opportunity will be
gone."</p>
<p>The Major without further demur, escorted Loveday across the
room. The conversation between the four intimate friends had now
become general and animated, and he had to wait for a minute or so
before he could get an opportunity to speak to his mother.</p>
<p>During that minute Loveday stood a little in his rear, with Lady
Gwynne and Cassimi at her right hand.</p>
<p>"I want to introduce this lady to you," said the Major, when a
pause in the talk gave him his opportunity. "This is Miss Loveday
Brooke, a lady detective, and she is here at my request to
investigate the circumstances connected with the disappearance of
Mdlle. Cunier."</p>
<p>He said the words slowly and distinctly.</p>
<p>"There!" he said to himself complacently, as he ended; "if I had
been reading the lessons in church, I couldn't have been more
emphatic."</p>
<p>A blank silence for a moment fell upon the group, and even the
butler, just then entering with the claret-cup, came to a
standstill at the door.</p>
<p>Then, simultaneously, a glance flashed from Mrs. Druce to Lady
Gwynne, from Lady Gwynne to Mrs. Druce, and then, also
simultaneously, the eyes of both ladies rested, though only for an
instant, on the big picture hat lying on the chair.</p>
<p>Lady Gwynne started to her feet and seized her hat, adjusting it
without so much as a glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>"I must go at once; this very minute," she said. "I promised
Charlie I would back soon after six, and now it is past seven. Mr.
Cassimi, will you take me down to my carriage?" And with the most
hurried of leave-takings to the Princess and her hostess, the lady
swept out of the room, followed by Mr. Cassimi.</p>
<p>The butler still standing at the door, drew back to allow the
lady to pass, and then, claret-cup and all, followed her out of the
room.</p>
<p>Mrs. Druce drew a long breath and bowed formally to Loveday.</p>
<p>"I was a little taken by surprise," she began&mdash;</p>
<p>But here the Princess rose suddenly from the sofa.</p>
<p>"Moi, je suis fatigu?e," she said in excellent French to Mrs.
Druce, and she too swept out of the room, throwing, as she passed,
what seemed to Loveday a slightly scornful glance towards the
Major.</p>
<p>Her two attendants, one carrying her fan, and the other her
reclining cushions, followed.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="289" height=
"360" src="1302211h-images/38.gif"><br>
SHE SWEPT OUT OF THE ROOM.</p>
<p>Mrs. Druce again turned to Loveday.</p>
<p>"Yes, I confess I was taken a little by surprise," she said, her
manner thawing slightly. "I am not accustomed to the presence of
detectives in my house; but now tell me what do you propose doing:
how do you mean to begin your investigations&mdash;by going over
the house and looking in all the corners, or by cross-questioning
the servants? Forgive my asking, but really I am quite at a loss; I
haven't the remotest idea how such investigations are generally
conducted."</p>
<p>"I do not propose to do much in the way of investigation
to-night," answered Loveday as formally as she had been addressed,
"for I have very important business to transact before eight
o'clock this evening. I shall ask you to allow me to see Mdlle.
Cunier's room&mdash;ten minutes there will be
sufficient&mdash;after that, I do not think I need further trouble
you."</p>
<p>"Certainly; by all means," answered Mrs. Druce; "you'll find the
room exactly as Lucie left it, nothing has been disturbed."</p>
<p>She turned to the butler, who had by this time returned and
stood presenting the claret-cup, and, in French, desired him to
summon her maid, and tell her to show Miss Brooke to Mdlle.
Cunier's room.</p>
<p>The ten minutes that Loveday had said would suffice for her
survey of this room extended themselves to fifteen, but the extra
five minutes assuredly were not expended by her in the
investigation of drawers and boxes. The maid, a pleasant,
well-spoken young woman, jingled her keys, and opened every lock,
and seemed not at all disinclined to enter into the light gossip
that Loveday contrived to set going.</p>
<p>She answered freely a variety of questions that Loveday put to
her respecting Mademoiselle and her general habits, and from
Mademoiselle, the talk drifted to other members of Mrs. Druce's
household.</p>
<p>If Loveday had, as she had stated, important business to
transact that evening, she certainly set about it in a strange
fashion.</p>
<p>After she quitted Mademoiselle's room, she went straight out of
the house, without leaving a message of any sort for either Mrs. or
Major Druce. She walked the length of Portland Place in leisurely
fashion, and then, having first ascertained that her movements were
not being watched, she called a hansom, and desired the man to
drive her to Madame Celine's, a fashionable milliner's in Old Bond
Street.</p>
<p>At Madame Celine's she spent close upon half-an-hour, giving
many and minute directions for the making of a hat, which
assuredly, when finished, would compare with nothing in the way of
millinery that she had ever before put upon her head.</p>
<p>From Madame Celine's the hansom conveyed her to an undertaker's
shop, at the corner of South Savile Street, and here she spent a
brief ten minutes in conversation with the undertaker himself in
his little back parlour.</p>
<p>From the undertaker's she drove home to her rooms in Gower
Street, and then, before she divested herself of hat and coat, she
wrote a brief note to Major Druce, requesting him to meet her on
the following morning at Eglac?'s, the confectioner's, in South
Savile Street, at nine o'clock punctually.</p>
<p>This note she committed to the charge of the cab-driver,
desiring him to deliver it at Portland Place on his way back to his
stand.</p>
<p>"They've queer ways of doing things&mdash;these people!" said
the Major, as he opened and read the note. "Suppose I must keep the
appointment though, confound it. I can't see that she can possibly
have found out anything by just sitting still in a corner for a
couple of hours! And I'm confident she didn't give that beast
Cassimi one quarter the attention she bestowed on other
people."</p>
<p>In spite of his grumbling, however, the Major kept his
appointment, and nine o'clock the next morning saw him shaking
hands with Miss Brooke on Eglac?'s doorstep.</p>
<p>"Dismiss your hansom," she said to him. "I only want you to come
a few doors down the street, to the French Protestant church, to
which you have sometimes escorted Mdlle. Cunier."</p>
<p>At the church door Loveday paused a moment.</p>
<p>"Before we enter," she said, "I want you to promise that
whatever you may see going on there&mdash;however greatly you may
be surprised&mdash;you will make no disturbance, not so much as
open your lips till we come out."</p>
<p>The Major, not a little bewildered, gave the required promise;
and, side by side, the two entered the church.</p>
<p>It was little more than a big room; at the farther end, in the
middle of the nave, stood the pulpit, and immediately behind this
was a low platform, enclosed by a brass rail.</p>
<p>Behind this brass rail, in black Geneva gown, stood the pastor
of the church, and before him, on cushions, kneeled two persons, a
man and a woman.</p>
<p>These two persons and an old man, the verger, formed the whole
of the congregation. The position of the church, amid shops and
narrow back-yards, had necessitated the filling in of every one of
its windows with stained glass; it was, consequently, so dim that,
coming in from the outside glare of sunlight, the Major found it
difficult to make out what was going on at the farther end.</p>
<p>The verger came forward and offered to show them to a seat.
Loveday shook her head&mdash;they would be leaving in a minute, she
said, and would prefer standing where they were.</p>
<p>The Major began to take in the situation.</p>
<p>"Why they're being married!" he said in a loud whisper. "What on
earth have you brought me in here for?"</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="256" height=
"435" src="1302211h-images/39.gif"><br>
"WHY, THEY ARE BEING MARRIED!"</p>
<p>Loveday laid her finger on her lips and frowned severely at
him.</p>
<p>The marriage service came to an end, the pastor extended his
black-gowned arms like the wings of a bat and pronounced the
benediction; the man and woman rose from their knees and proceeded
to follow him into the vestry.</p>
<p>The woman was neatly dressed in a long dove-coloured travelling
cloak. She wore a large hat, from which fell a white gossamer veil
that completely hid her face from view. The man was small, dark and
slight, and as he passed on to the vestry beside his bride, the
Major at once identified him as his mother's butler.</p>
<p>"Why, that's Lebrun!" he said in a still louder whisper than
before. "Why, in the name of all that's wonderful, have you brought
me here to see that fellow married?"</p>
<p>"You'd better come outside if you can't keep quiet," said
Loveday severely, and leading the way out of the church as she
spoke.</p>
<p>Outside, South Savile Street was busy with early morning
traffic.</p>
<p>"Let us go back to Eglac?'s" said Loveday, "and have some
coffee. I will explain to you there all you are wishing to
know."</p>
<p>But before the coffee could be brought to them, the Major had
asked at least a dozen questions.</p>
<p>Loveday put them all on one side.</p>
<p>"All in good time" she said. "You are leaving out the most
important question of all. Have you no curiosity to know who was
the bride that Lebrun has chosen?"</p>
<p>"I don't suppose it concerns me in the slightest degree," he
answered indifferently; "but since you wish me to ask the
question&mdash;Who was she?"</p>
<p>"Lucie Cunier, lately your mother's amanuensis."</p>
<p>"The&mdash;!" cried the Major, jumping to his feet and uttering
an exclamation that must be indicated by a blank.</p>
<p>"Take it calmly," said Loveday; "don't rave. Sit down and I'll
tell you all about it. No, it is not the doing of your friend
Cassimi, so you need not threaten to put a bullet into him; the
girl has married Lebrun of her own free will&mdash;no one has
forced her into it."</p>
<p>"Lucie has married Lebrun of her own free will!" he echoed,
growing very white and taking the chair which faced Loveday at the
little table.</p>
<p>"Will you have sugar?" asked Loveday, stirring the coffee, which
the waiter at that moment brought.</p>
<p>"Yes, I repeat," she presently resumed, "Lucie has married
Lebrun of her own free will, although I conjecture she might not
perhaps have been quite so willing to crown his happiness if the
Princess Dullah-Veih had not made it greatly to her interest to do
so."</p>
<p>"Dolly made it to her interest to do so?" again echoed the
Major.</p>
<p>"Do not interrupt me with exclamations; let me tell the story my
own fashion, and then you may ask as many questions as you please.
Now, to begin at the beginning, Lucie became engaged to Lebrun
within a month of her coming to your mother's house, but she
carefully kept the secret from everyone, even from the servants,
until about a month ago, when she mentioned the fact in confidence
to Mrs. Druce in order to defend herself from the charge of having
sought to attract your attention. There was nothing surprising in
this engagement; they were both lonely and in a foreign land, spoke
the same language, and no doubt had many things in common; and,
although chance has lifted Lucie somewhat out of her station, she
really belongs to the same class in life as Lebrun. Their
love-making appears to have run along smoothly enough until you
came home on leave, and the girl's pretty face attracted your
attention. Your evident admiration for her disturbed the equanimity
of the Princess, who saw your devotion to herself waning; of
Lebrun, who fancied Lucie's manner to him had changed; of your
mother, who was anxious that you should make a suitable marriage.
Also additional complications arose from the fact that your
attentions to the little Swiss girl had drawn Mr. Cassimi's notice
to her numerous attractions, and there was the danger of you two
young men posing as rivals. At this juncture Lady Gwynne, as an
intimate friend, and one who had herself suffered a twinge of
heartache on Mademoiselle's account, was taken into your mother's
confidence, and the three ladies in council decided that Lucie, in
some fashion, must be got out of the way before you, and Mr.
Cassimi came to an open breach, or you had spoilt your matrimonial
prospects."</p>
<p>Here the Major made a slightly impatient movement.</p>
<p>Loveday went on: "It was the Princess who solved the question
how this was to be done. Fair Rosamonds are no longer put out of
the way by 'a cup of cold poison'&mdash;golden guineas do the thing
far more easily and innocently. The Princess expressed her
willingness to bestow a thousand pounds on Lucie on the day that
she married Lebrun, and to set her up afterwards as a fashionable
milliner in Paris. After this munificent offer, everything else
became mere matter of detail. The main thing was to get the damsel
out of the way without your being able to trace her&mdash;perhaps
work on her feelings, and induce her, at the last moment, to throw
over Lebrun. Your absence from home, on a three days' visit, gave
them the wished-for opportunity. Lady Gwynne took her milliner into
her confidence. Madame Celine consented to receive Lucie into her
house, seclude her in a room on the upper floor, and at the same
time give her an insight into the profession of a fashionable
milliner. The rest I think you know. Lucie quietly walks out of the
house one afternoon, taking no luggage, calling no cab, and thereby
cutting off one very obvious means of being traced. Madame Celine
receives and hides her&mdash;not a difficult feat to accomplish in
London, more especially if the one to be hidden is a foreign
amanuensis, who is seldom seen out of doors, and who leaves no
photograph behind her."</p>
<p>"I suppose it was Lebrun who had the confounded cheek to go to
my drawer and appropriate that photograph. I wish it had been
Cassimi&mdash;I could have kicked him, but&mdash;but it makes one
feel rather small to have posed as rival to one's mother's
butler."</p>
<p>"I think you may congratulate yourself that Lebrun did nothing
worse than go to your drawer and appropriate that photograph. I
never saw a man bestow a more deadly look of hatred than he threw
at you yesterday afternoon in your mother's drawing-room; it was
that look of hatred that first drew my attention to the man and set
me on the track that has ended in the Swiss Protestant church this
morning."</p>
<p>"Ah! let me hear about that&mdash;let me have the links in the
chain, one by one, as you came upon them," said the Major.</p>
<p>He was still pale&mdash;almost as the marble table at which they
sat, but his voice had gone back to its normal slow, soft
drawl.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="307" height=
"325" src="1302211h-images/40.gif"><br>
HE WAS STILL PALE.</p>
<p>"With pleasure. The look that Lebrun threw at you, as he crossed
the room to open the window, was link number one. As I saw that
look, I said to myself there is someone in that corner whom that
man hates with a deadly hatred. Then you came forward to speak to
me, and I saw that it was you that the man was ready to murder, if
opportunity offered. After this, I scrutinized him
closely&mdash;not a detail of his features or his dress escaped me,
and I noticed, among other things, that on the fourth finger of his
left hand, half hidden by a more pretentious ring, was an old
fashioned curious looking silver one. That silver ring was link
number two in the chain."</p>
<p>"Ah, I suppose you asked for that glass of water on purpose to
get a closer view of the ring?"</p>
<p>"I did, I found it was a Genevese ring of ancient make, the like
of which I had not seen since I was a child and played with one,
that my old Swiss bonne used to wear. Now I must tell you a little
bit of Genevese history before I can make you understand how
important a link that silver ring was to me. Echallets, the town in
which Lucie was born, and her father had kept a watchmaker's shop,
has long been famous for its jewellery and watchmaking. The two
trades, however, were not combined in one until about a hundred
years ago, when the corporation of the town passed a law decreeing
that they should unite in one guild for their common good. To
celebrate this amalgamation of interests, the jewellers fabricated
a certain number of silver rings, consisting of a plain band of
silver, on which two hands, in relief, clasped each other. These
rings were distributed among the members of the guild, and as time
has gone on they have become scarce and valuable as relics of the
past. In certain families, they have been handed down as heirlooms,
and have frequently done duty as betrothal rings&mdash;the clasped
hands no doubt suggesting their suitability for this purpose. Now,
when I saw such a ring on Lebrun's finger, I naturally guessed from
whom he had received it, and at once classed his interests with
those of your mother and the Princess, and looked upon him as their
possible coadjutor."</p>
<p>"What made you throw the brute Cassimi altogether out of your
reckoning?"</p>
<p>"I did not do so at this stage of events; only, so to speak,
marked him as 'doubtful' and kept my eye on him. I determined to
try an experiment that I have never before attempted in my work.
You know what that experiment was. I saw five persons, Mrs. Druce,
the Princess, Lady Gwynne, Mr. Cassimi and Lebrun all in the room
within a few yards of each other, and I asked you to take them by
surprise and announce my name and profession, so that every one of
those five persons could hear you."</p>
<p>"You did. I could not, for the life of me, make out what was
your motive for so doing."</p>
<p>"My motive for so doing was simply, as it were, to raise the
sudden cry, 'The enemy is upon you,' and to set every one of those
five persons guarding their weak point&mdash;that is, if they had
one. I'll draw your attention to what followed. Mr. Cassimi
remained nonchalant and impassive; your mother and Lady Gwynne
exchanged glances, and they both simultaneously threw a nervous
look at Lady Gwynne's hat lying on the chair. Now as I had stood
waiting to be introduced to Mrs. Druce, I had casually read the
name of Madame C?line on the lining of the hat and I at once
concluded that Madame C?line must be a very weak point indeed; a
conclusion that was confirmed when Lady Gwynne hurriedly seized her
hat and as hurriedly departed. Then the Princess scarcely less
abruptly rose and left the room, and Lebrun on the point of
entering, quitted it also. When he returned five minutes later,
with the claret-cup, he had removed the ring from his finger, so I
had now little doubt where his weak point lay."</p>
<p>"It's wonderful; it's like a fairy tale!," drawled the Major.
"Pray, go on."</p>
<p>"After this," continued Loveday, "my work became very simple. I
did not care two straws for seeing Mademoiselle's room, but I cared
very much to have a talk with Mrs. Druce's maid. From her I
elicited the important fact that Lebrun was leaving very
unexpectedly on the following day, and that his boxes were packed
and labeled for Paris. After I left your house, I drove to Madame
C?line's, and there, as a sort of entrance fee, ordered an
elaborate hat. I praised freely the hats they had on view, and
while giving minute directions as to the one I required, I
extracted the information that Madame C?line had recently taken on
a new milliner who had very great artistic skill. Upon this, I
asked permission to see this new milliner and give her special
instructions concerning my hat. My request was referred to Madame
C?line, who appeared much ruffled by it, and informed me that it
would be quite useless for me to see this new milliner; she could
execute no more orders, as she was leaving the next day for Paris,
where she intended opening an establishment on her own account.</p>
<p>"Now you see the point at which I had arrived. There was Lebrun
and there was this new milliner each leaving for Paris on the same
day; it was not unreasonable to suppose that they might start in
company, and that before so doing, a little ceremony might be gone
through in the Swiss Protestant church that Mademoiselle
occasionally attended. This conjecture sent me to the undertaker in
South Savile Street, who combines with his undertaking the office
of verger to the little church. From him I learned that a marriage
was to take place at the church at a quarter to nine the next
morning and that the names of the contracting parties were Pierre
Lebrun and Lucie Cu?nin."</p>
<p>"Cu?nin!"</p>
<p>"Yes, that is the girl's real name; it seems Lady Gwynne
re-christened her Cunier, because she said the English
pronunciation of Cu?nin grated on her ear&mdash;people would insist
upon adding a <i>g</i> after the <i>n</i>. She introduced her to
Mrs. Druce under the name of Cunier, forgetting, perhaps, the
girl's real name, or else thinking it a matter of no importance.
This fact, no doubt, considerably lessened Lebrun's fear of
detection in procuring his licence and transmitting it to the Swiss
pastor. Perhaps you are a little surprised at my knowledge of the
facts I related to you at the beginning of our conversation. I got
at them through Lebrun this morning. At half-past eight I went down
to the church and found him there, waiting for his bride. He grew
terribly excited at seeing me, and thought I was going to bring you
down on him and upset his wedding arrangements at the last moment.
I assured him to the contrary, and his version of the facts I have
handed on to you. Should, however, any details of the story seem to
you to be lacking, I have no doubt that Mrs. Druce or the Princess
will supply them, now that all necessity for secrecy has come to an
end."</p>
<p>The Major drew on his gloves; his colour had come back to him;
he had resumed his easy suavity of manner.</p>
<p>"I don't think," he said slowly, "I'll trouble my mother or the
Princess; and I shall be glad, if you have the opportunity, if you
will make people understand that I only moved in the matter at all
out of&mdash;of mere kindness to a young and friendless
foreigner."</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="V" id="V"><i>DRAWN
DAGGERS.</i></a></h3>
<p>"I <small>ADMIT</small> that the dagger business is something of
a puzzle to me, but as for the lost necklace&mdash;well, I should
have thought a child would have understood that," said Mr. Dyer
irritably. "When a young lady loses a valuable article of jewellery
and wishes to hush the matter up, the explanation is obvious."</p>
<p>"Sometimes," answered Miss Brooke calmly, "the explanation that
is obvious is the one to be rejected, not accepted."</p>
<p>Off and on these two had been, so to speak, "jangling" a good
deal that morning. Perhaps the fact was in part to be attributed to
the biting east wind which had set Loveday's eyes watering with the
gritty dust, as she had made her way to Lynch Court, and which was,
at the present moment, sending the smoke, in aggravating gusts,
down the chimney into Mr. Dyer's face. Thus it was, however. On the
various topics that had chanced to come up for discussion that
morning between Mr. Dyer and his colleague, they had each taken up,
as if by design, diametrically opposite points of view.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="293" height=
"403" src="1302211h-images/41.gif"><br>
HAD BEEN JANGLING A GOOD DEAL.</p>
<p>His temper altogether gave way now.</p>
<p>"If," he said, bringing his hand down with emphasis on his
writing table, "you lay it down as a principle that the obvious is
to be rejected in favour of the abstruse, you'll soon find yourself
launched in the predicament of having to prove that two apples
added to two other apples do not make four. But there, if you don't
choose to see things from my point of view, that is no reason why
you should lose your temper!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Hawke wishes to see you, sir," said a clerk, at that moment
entering the room.</p>
<p>It was a fortunate diversion. Whatever might be the differences
of opinion in which these two might indulge in private, they were
careful never to parade those differences before their clients.</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer's irritability vanished in a moment.</p>
<p>"Show the gentleman in," he said to the clerk. Then he turned to
Loveday. "This is the Rev. Anthony Hawke, the gentleman at whose
house I told you that Miss Monroe is staying temporarily. He is a
clergyman of the Church of England, but gave up his living some
twenty years ago when he married a wealthy lady. Miss Monroe has
been sent over to his guardianship from Pekin by her father, Sir
George Monroe, in order to get her out of the way of a troublesome
and undesirable suitor."</p>
<p>The last sentence was added in a low and hurried tone, for Mr.
Hawke was at that moment entering the room.</p>
<p>He was a man close upon sixty years of age, white-haired, clean
shaven, with a full, round face, to which a small nose imparted a
somewhat infantine expression. His manner of greeting was urbane
but slightly flurried and nervous. He gave Loveday the impression
of being an easy-going, happy-tempered man who, for the moment, was
unusually disturbed and perplexed.</p>
<p>He glanced uneasily at Loveday. Mr. Dyer hastened to explain
that this was the lady by whose aid he hoped to get to the bottom
of the matter now under consideration.</p>
<p>"In that case there can be no objection to my showing you this,"
said Mr. Hawke; "it came by post this morning. You see my enemy
still pursues me."</p>
<p>As he spoke he took from his pocket a big, square envelope, from
which he drew a large-sized sheet of paper.</p>
<p>On this sheet of paper were roughly drawn, in ink, two daggers,
about six inches in length, with remarkably pointed blades.</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer looked at the sketch with interest.</p>
<p>"We will compare this drawing and its envelope with those you
previously received," he said, opening a drawer of his
writing-table and taking thence a precisely similar envelope. On
the sheet of paper, however, that this envelope enclosed, there was
drawn one dagger only.</p>
<p>He placed both envelopes and their enclosures side by side, and
in silence compared them. Then, without a word, he handed them to
Miss Brooke, who, taking a glass from her pocket, subjected them to
a similar careful and minute scrutiny.</p>
<p>Both envelopes were of precisely the same make, and were each
addressed to Mr. Hawke's London address in a round, school-boyish,
copy-book sort of hand&mdash;the hand so easy to write and so
difficult to being home to any writer on account of its want of
individuality. Each envelope likewise bore a Cork and a London
postmark.</p>
<p>The sheet of paper, however, that the first envelope enclosed
bore the sketch of one dagger only.</p>
<p>Loveday laid down her glass.</p>
<p>"The envelopes," she said, "have, undoubtedly, been addressed by
the same person, but these last two daggers have not been drawn by
the hand that drew the first. Dagger number one was, evidently,
drawn by a timid, uncertain and inartistic hand&mdash;see how the
lines wave and how they have been patched here and there. The
person who drew the other daggers, I should say, could do better
work; the outline, though rugged, is bold and free. I should like
to take these sketches home with me and compare them again at my
leisure."</p>
<p>"Ah, I felt sure what your opinion would be!" said Mr. Dyer
complacently.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawke seemed much disturbed.</p>
<p>"Good gracious!" he ejaculated; "you don't mean to say I have
two enemies pursuing me in this fashion! What does it mean? Can it
be&mdash;is it possible, do you think, that these things have been
sent to me by the members of some Secret Society in
Ireland&mdash;under error, of course&mdash;mistaking me for someone
else? They can't be meant for me; I have never, in my whole life,
been mixed up with any political agitation of any sort."</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer shook his head. "Members of secret societies generally
make pretty sure of their ground before they send out missives of
this kind," he said. "I have never heard of such an error being
made. I think, too, we mustn't build any theories on the Irish
post-mark; the letters may have been posted in Cork for the whole
and sole purpose of drawing off attention from some other
quarter."</p>
<p>"Will you mind telling me a little about the loss of the
necklace?" here said Loveday, bringing the conversation suddenly
round from the daggers to the diamonds.</p>
<p>"I think," interposed Mr. Dyers, turning towards her, "that the
episode of the drawn daggers&mdash;drawn in a double
sense&mdash;should be treated entirely on its own merits,
considered as a thing apart from the loss of the necklace. I am
inclined to believe that when we have gone a little further into
the matter we shall find that each circumstance belongs to a
different group of facts. After all, it is possible that these
daggers may have been sent by way of a joke&mdash;a rather foolish
one, I admit&mdash;by some harum-scarum fellow bent on causing a
sensation."</p>
<p>Mr. Hawke's face brightened.</p>
<p>"Ah! now, do you think so&mdash;really think so?" he ejaculated.
"It would lift such a load from my mind if you could bring the
thing home, in this way, to some practical joker. There are a lot
of such fellows knocking about the world. Why, now I come to think
of it, my nephew, Jack, who is a good deal with us just now, and is
not quite so steady a fellow as I should like him to be, must have
a good many such scamps among his acquaintances."</p>
<p>"A good many such scamps among his acquaintances," echoed
Loveday; "that certainly gives plausibility to Mr. Dyer's
supposition. At the same time, I think we are bound to look at the
other side of the case, and admit the possibility of these daggers
being sent in right-down sober earnest by persons concerned in the
robbery, with the intention of intimidating you and preventing full
investigation of the matter. If this be so, it will not signify
which thread we take up and follow. If we find the sender of the
daggers we are safe to come upon the thief; or, if we follow up and
find the thief, the sender of the daggers will not be far off."</p>
<p>Mr. Hawke's face fell once more.</p>
<p>"It's an uncomfortable position to be in," he said slowly. "I
suppose, whoever they are, they will do the regulation thing, and
next time will send an instalment of three daggers, in which case I
may consider myself a doomed man. It did not occur to me before,
but I remember now that I did not receive the first dagger until
after I had spoken very strongly to Mrs. Hawke, before the
servants, about my wish to set the police to work. I told her I
felt bound, in honour to Sir George, to do so, as the necklace had
been lost under my roof."</p>
<p>"Did Mrs. Hawke object to your calling in the aid of the
police?" asked Loveday.</p>
<p>"Yes, most strongly. She entirely supported Miss Monroe in her
wish to take no steps in the matter. Indeed, I should not have come
round as I did last night to Mr. Dyer, if my wife had not been
suddenly summoned from home by the serious illness of her sister.
At least," he corrected himself with a little attempt at
self-assertion, "my coming to him might have been a little delayed.
I hope you understand, Mr. Dyer; I do not mean to imply that I am
not master in my own house."</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="119" height=
"360" src="1302211h-images/42.gif"><br>
"I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND."</p>
<p>"Oh, quite so, quite so," responded Mr. Dyer. "Did Mrs. Hawke or
Miss Monroe give any reasons for not wishing you to move in the
matter?"</p>
<p>"All told, I should think they gave about a hundred
reasons&mdash;I can't remember them all. For one thing, Miss Monroe
said it might necessitate her appearing in the police courts, a
thing she would not consent to do; and she certainly did not
consider the necklace was worth the fuss I was making over it. And
that necklace, sir, has been valued at over nine hundred pounds,
and has come down to the young lady from her mother."</p>
<p>"And Mrs. Hawke?"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Hawke supported Miss Monroe in her views in her presence.
But privately to me afterwards, she gave other reasons for not
wishing the police called in. Girls, she said, were always careless
with their jewellery, she might have lost the necklace in Pekin,
and never have brought it to England at all."</p>
<p>"Quite so," said Mr. Dyer. "I think I understood you to say that
no one had seen the necklace since Miss Monroe's arrival in
England. Also, I believe it was she who first discovered it to be
missing?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Sir George, when he wrote apprising me of his daughter's
visit, added a postscript to his letter, saying that his daughter
was bringing her necklace with her and that he would feel greatly
obliged if I would have it deposited with as little delay as
possible at my bankers', where it could be easily got at if
required. I spoke to Miss Monroe about doing this two or three
times, but she did not seem at all inclined to comply with her
father's wishes. Then my wife took the matter in hand&mdash;Mrs.
Hawke, I must tell you, has a very firm, resolute manner&mdash;she
told Miss Monroe plainly that she would not have the responsibility
of those diamonds in the house, and insisted that there and then
they should be sent off to the bankers. Upon this Miss Monroe went
up to her room, and presently returned, saying that her necklace
had disappeared. She herself, she said, had placed it in her
jewel-case and the jewel-case in her wardrobe, when her boxes were
unpacked. The jewel-case was in the wardrobe right enough, and no
other article of jewellery appeared to have been disturbed, but the
little padded niche in which the necklace had been deposited was
empty. My wife and her maid went upstairs immediately, and searched
every corner of the room, but, I'm sorry to say, without any
result."</p>
<p>"Miss Monroe, I suppose, has her own maid?"</p>
<p>"No, she has not. The maid&mdash;an elderly native
woman&mdash;who left Pekin with her, suffered so terribly from
sea-sickness that, when they reached Malta, Miss Monroe allowed her
to land and remain there in charge of an agent of the P. and O.
Company till an outward bound packet could take her back to China.
It seems the poor woman thought she was going to die, and was in a
terrible state of mind because she hadn't brought her coffin with
her. I dare say you know the terror these Chinese have of being
buried in foreign soil. After her departure, Miss Monroe engaged
one of the steerage passengers to act as her maid for the remainder
of the voyage."</p>
<p>"Did Miss Monroe make the long journey from Pekin accompanied
only by this native woman?"</p>
<p>"No; friends escorted her to Hong King&mdash;by far the roughest
part of the journey. From Hong Kong she came on in <i>The
Colombo</i>, accompanied only by her maid. I wrote and told her
father I would meet her at the docks in London; the young lady,
however, preferred landing at Plymouth, and telegraphed to me from
there that she was coming on by rail to Waterloo, where, if I
liked, I might meet her."</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="347" height=
"385" src="1302211h-images/43.gif"><br>
"SHE CAME IN 'THE COLOMBO,' ACCOMPANIED BY HER MAID."</p>
<p>"She seems to be a young lady of independent habits. Was she
brought up and educated in China?"</p>
<p>"Yes; by a succession of French and American governesses. After
her mother's death, when she was little more than a baby, Sir
George could not make up his mind to part with her, as she was his
only child."</p>
<p>"I suppose you and Sir George Monroe are old friends?"</p>
<p>"Yes; he and I were great chums before he went out to
China&mdash;now about twenty years ago&mdash;and it was only
natural, when he wished to get his daughter out of the way of young
Danvers's impertinent attentions, that he should ask me to take
charge of her till he could claim his retiring pension and set up
his tent in England."</p>
<p>"What was the chief objection to Mr. Danvers's attentions?"</p>
<p>"Well, he is only a boy of one-and-twenty, and has no money into
the bargain. He has been sent out to Pekin by his father to study
the language, in order to qualify for a billet in the customs, and
it may be a dozen years before he is in a position to keep a wife.
Now, Miss Monroe is an heiress&mdash;will come into her mother's
large fortune when she is of age&mdash;and Sir George, naturally,
would like her to make a good match."</p>
<p>"I suppose Miss Monroe came to England very reluctantly?"</p>
<p>"I imagine so. No doubt it was a great wrench for her to leave
her home and friends in that sudden fashion and come to us, who
are, one and all, utter strangers to her. She is very quiet, very
shy and reserved. She goes nowhere, sees no one. When some old
China friends of her father's called to see her the other day, she
immediately found she had a headache, and went to bed. I think, on
the whole, she gets on better with my nephew than with anyone
else."</p>
<p>"Will you kindly tell me of how many persons your household
consists at the present moment?</p>
<p>"At the present moment we are one more than usual, for my
nephew, Jack, is home with his regiment from India, and is staying
with us. As a rule, my household consists of my wife and myself,
butler, cook, housemaid and my wife's maid, who just now is doing
double duty as Miss Monroe's maid also."</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer looked at his watch.</p>
<p>"I have an important engagement in ten minutes' time," he said,
"so I must leave you and Miss Brooke to arrange details as to how
and when she is to begin her work inside your house, for, of
course, in a case of this sort we must, in the first instance at
any rate, concentrate attention within your four walls."</p>
<p>"The less delay the better," said Loveday. "I should like to
attack the mystery at once&mdash;this afternoon."</p>
<p>Mr. Hawke thought for a moment.</p>
<p>"According to present arrangements," he said, with a little
hesitation, "Mrs. Hawke will return next Friday, that is the day
after to-morrow, so I can only ask you to remain in the house till
the morning of that day. I'm sure you will understand that there
might be some&mdash;some little awkwardness in&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, quite so," interrupted Loveday. "I don't see at present
that there will be any necessity for me to sleep in the house at
all. How would it be for me to assume the part of a lady house
decorator in the employment of a West-end firm, and sent by them to
survey your house and advise upon its re-decoration? All I should
have to do, would be to walk about your rooms with my head on one
side, and a pencil and note-book in my hand. I should interfere
with no one, your family life would go on as usual, and I could
make my work as short or as long as necessity might dictate."</p>
<p>Mr. Hawke had no objection to offer to this. He had, however, a
request to make as he rose to depart, and he made it a little
nervously.</p>
<p>"If," he said, "by any chance there should come a telegram from
Mrs. Hawke, saying she will return by an earlier train, I
suppose&mdash;I hope, that is, you will make some excuse,
and&mdash;and not get me into hot water, I mean."</p>
<p>To this, Loveday answered a little evasively that she trusted no
such telegram would be forthcoming, but that, in any case, he might
rely upon her discretion.</p>
<p><br>
Four o'clock was striking from a neighbouring church clock as
Loveday lifted the old-fashioned brass knocker of Mr. Hawke's house
in Tavistock Square. An elderly butler admitted her and showed her
into the drawing-room on the first floor. A single glance round
showed Loveday that if her r?le had been real instead of assumed,
she would have found plenty of scope for her talents. Although the
house was in all respects comfortably furnished, it bore
unmistakably the impress of those early Victorian days when
aesthetic surroundings were not deemed a necessity of existence; an
impress which people past middle age, and growing increasingly
indifferent to the accessories of life, are frequently careless to
remove.</p>
<p>"Young life here is evidently an excrescence, not part of the
home; a troop of daughters turned into this room would speedily set
going a different condition of things," thought Loveday, taking
stock of the faded white and gold wall paper, the chairs covered
with lilies and roses in cross-stitch, and the knick-knacks of a
past generation that were scattered about on tables and
mantelpiece.</p>
<p>A yellow damask curtain, half-festooned, divided the back
drawing-room from the front in which she was seated. From the other
side of this curtain there came to her the sound of
voices&mdash;those of a man and a girl.</p>
<p>"Cut the cards again, please," said the man's voice. "Thank you.
There you are again&mdash;the queen of hearts, surrounded with
diamonds, and turning her back on a knave. Miss Monroe, you can't
do better than make that fortune come true. Turn your back on the
man who let you go without a word and&mdash;"</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="408" height=

"CUT THE CARDS AGAIN, PLEASE."</p>
<p>"Hush!" interrupted the girl with a little laugh: "I heard the
next room door open&mdash;I'm sure someone came in."</p>
<p>The girl's laugh seemed to Loveday utterly destitute of that
echo of heart-ache that in the circumstances might have been
expected.</p>
<p>At this moment Mr. Hawke entered the room, and almost
simultaneously the two young people came from the other side of the
yellow curtain and crossed towards the door.</p>
<p>Loveday took a survey of them as they passed.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="284" height=
"374" src="1302211h-images/45.gif"><br>
LOVEDAY TOOK A SURVEY OF THEM AS THEY PASSED.</p>
<p>The young man&mdash;evidently "my nephew, Jack"&mdash;was a
good-looking young fellow, with dark eyes and hair. The girl was
small, slight and fair. She was perceptibly less at home with
Jack's uncle than she was with Jack, for her manner changed and
grew formal and reserved as she came face to face with him.</p>
<p>"We're going downstairs to have a game of billiards," said Jack,
addressing Mr. Hawke, and throwing a look of curiosity at
Loveday.</p>
<p>"Jack," said the old gentleman, "what would you say if I told
you I was going to have the house re-decorated from top to bottom,
and that this lady had come to advise on the matter."</p>
<p>This was the nearest (and most Anglic?) approach to a
fabrication that Mr. Hawke would allow to pass his lips.</p>
<p>"Well," answered Jack promptly, "I should say, 'not before its
time.' That would cover a good deal."</p>
<p>Then the two young people departed in company.</p>
<p>Loveday went straight to her work.</p>
<p>"I'll begin my surveying at the top of the house, and at once,
if you please," she said. "Will you kindly tell one of your maids
to show me through the bed-rooms? If it is possible, let that maid
be the one who waits on Miss Monroe and Mrs. Hawke."</p>
<p>The maid who responded to Mr. Hawke's summons was in perfect
harmony with the general appearance of the house. In addition,
however, to being elderly and faded, she was also remarkably
sour-visaged, and carried herself as if she thought that Mr. Hawke
had taken a great liberty in thus commanding her attendance.</p>
<p>In dignified silence she showed Loveday over the topmost story,
where the servants' bed-rooms were situated, and with a somewhat
supercilious expression of countenance, watched her making various
entries in her note-book.</p>
<p>In dignified silence, also, she led the way down to the second
floor, where were the principal bed-rooms of the house.</p>
<p>"This is Miss Monroe's room," she said, as she threw back a door
of one of these rooms, and then shut her lips with a snap, as if
they were never going to open again.</p>
<p>The room that Loveday entered was, like the rest of the house,
furnished in the style that prevailed in the early Victorian
period. The bedstead was elaborately curtained with pink lined
upholstery; the toilet-table was befrilled with muslin and tarlatan
out of all likeness to a table. The one point, however, that
chiefly attracted Loveday's attention was the extreme neatness that
prevailed throughout the apartment&mdash;a neatness, however, that
was carried out with so strict an eye to comfort and convenience
that it seemed to proclaim the hand of a first-class maid.
Everything in the room was, so to speak, squared to the quarter of
an inch, and yet everything that a lady could require in dressing
lay ready to hand. The dressing-gown lying on the back of a chair
had footstool and slippers beside it. A chair stood in front of the
toilet table, and on a small Japanese table to the right of the
chair were placed hair-pin box, comb and brush, and hand
mirror.</p>
<p>"This room will want money spent upon it," said Loveday, letting
her eyes roam critically in all directions. "Nothing but Moorish
wood-work will take off the squareness of those corners. But what a
maid Miss Monroe must have. I never before saw a room so orderly
and, at the same time, so comfortable."</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="306" height=
"351" src="1302211h-images/46.gif"><br>
"I NEVER SAW A ROOM SO ORDERLY."</p>
<p>This was so direct an appeal to conversation that the
sour-visaged maid felt compelled to open her lips.</p>
<p>"I wait on Miss Monroe, for the present," she said snappishly;
"but, to speak the truth, she scarcely requires a maid. I never
before in my life had dealings with such a young lady."</p>
<p>"She does so much for herself, you mean&mdash;declines much
assistance."</p>
<p>"She's like no one else I ever had to do with." (This was said
even more snappishly than before.) "She not only won't be helped in
dressing, but she arranges her room every day before leaving it,
even to placing the chair in front of the looking glass."</p>
<p>"And to opening the lid of the hair-pin box, so that she may
have the pins ready to her hand," added Loveday, for a moment
bending over the Japanese table, with its toilet accessories.</p>
<p>Another five minutes were all that Loveday accorded to the
inspection of this room. Then, a little to the surprise of the
dignified maid, she announced her intention of completing her
survey of the bed-rooms some other time, and dismissed her at the
drawing-room door, to tell Mr. Hawke that she wished to see him
before leaving.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawke, looking much disturbed and with a telegram in his
hand, quickly made his appearance.</p>
<p>"From my wife, to say she'll be back to-night. She'll be at
Waterloo in about half an hour from now," he said, holding up the
brown envelope. "Now, Miss Brooke, what are we to do? I told you
how much Mrs. Hawke objected to the investigation of this matter,
and she is very&mdash;well&mdash;firm when she once says a thing,
and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Set your mind at rest," interrupted Loveday; "I have done all I
wished to do within your walls, and the remainder of my
investigation can be carried on just as well at Lynch Court or at
my own private rooms."</p>
<p>"Done all you wished to do!" echoed Mr. Hawke in amazement;
"why, you've not been an hour in the house, and do you mean to tell
me you've found out anything about the necklace or the
daggers?"</p>
<p>"Don't ask me any questions just yet; I want you to answer one
or two instead. Now, can you tell me anything about any letters
Miss Monroe may have written or received since she has been in your
house?"</p>
<p>"Yes, certainly, Sir George wrote to me very strongly about her
correspondence, and begged me to keep a sharp eye on it, so as to
nip in the bud any attempt to communicate with Danvers. So far,
however, she does not appear to have made any such attempt. She is
frankness itself over her correspondence. Every letter that has
come addressed to her, she has shown either to me or to my wife,
and they have one and all been letters from old friends of her
father's, wishing to make her acquaintance now that she is in
England. With regard to letter-writing, I am sorry to say she has a
marked and most peculiar objection to it. Every one of the letters
she has received, my wife tells, me, remain unanswered still. She
has never once been seen, since she came to the house, with a pen
in her hand. And if she wrote on the sly, I don't know how she
would get her letters posted&mdash;she never goes outside the door
by herself, and she would have no opportunity of giving them to any
of the servants to post except Mrs. Hawke's maid, and she is beyond
suspicion in such a matter. She has been well cautioned, and, in
addition, is not the sort of person who would assist a young lady
in carrying on a clandestine correspondence."</p>
<p>"I should imagine not! I suppose Miss Monroe has been present at
the breakfast table each time that you have received your daggers
through the post&mdash;you told me, I think, that they had come by
the first post in the morning?"</p>
<p>"Yes; Miss Monroe is very punctual at meals, and has been
present each time. Naturally, when I received such unpleasant
missives, I made some sort of exclamation and then handed the thing
round the table for inspection, and Miss Monroe was very much
concerned to know who my secret enemy could be."</p>
<p>"No doubt. Now, Mr. Hawke, I have a very special request to make
to you, and I hope you will be most exact in carrying it out."</p>
<p>"You may rely upon my doing so to the very letter."</p>
<p>"Thank you. If, then, you should receive by post to-morrow
morning one of those big envelopes you already know the look of,
and find that it contains a sketch of three, not two, drawn
daggers&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Good gracious! what makes you think such a thing likely?"
exclaimed Mr. Hawke, greatly disturbed. "Why am I to be persecuted
in this way? Am I to take it for granted that I am a doomed
man?"</p>
<p>He began to pace the room in a state of great excitement.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="168" height=
"353" src="1302211h-images/47.gif"><br>
IN A STATE OF GREAT EXCITEMENT.</p>
<p>"I don't think I would if I were you," answered Loveday calmly.
"Pray let me finish. I want you to open the big envelope that may
come to you by post to-morrow morning just you have opened the
others&mdash;in full view of your family at the
breakfast-table&mdash;and to hand round the sketch it may contain
for inspection to your wife, your nephew and to Miss Monroe. Now,
will you promise me to do this?"</p>
<p>"Oh, certainly; I should most likely have done so without any
promising. But&mdash;but&mdash;I'm sure you'll understand that I
feel myself to be in a peculiarly uncomfortable position, and I
shall feel so very much obliged to you if you'll tell me&mdash;that
is if you'll enter a little more fully into an explanation."</p>
<p>Loveday looked at her watch. "I should think Mrs. Hawke would be
just at this moment arriving at Waterloo; I'm sure you'll be glad
to see the last of me. Please come to me at my rooms in Gower
Street to-morrow at twelve&mdash;here is my card. I shall then be
able to enter into fuller explanations I hope. Good-bye."</p>
<p>The old gentleman showed her politely downstairs, and, as he
shook hands with her at the front door, again asked, in a most
emphatic manner, if she did not consider him to be placed in a
"peculiarly unpleasant position."</p>
<p>Those last words at parting were to be the first with which he
greeted her on the following morning when he presented himself at
her rooms in Gower Street. They were, however, repeated in
considerably more agitated a manner.</p>
<p>"Was there ever a man in a more miserable position!" he
exclaimed, as he took the chair that Loveday indicated. "I not only
received the three daggers for which you prepared me, but I got an
additional worry, for which I was totally unprepared. This morning,
immediately after breakfast, Miss Monroe walked out of the house
all by herself, and no one knows where she has gone. And the girl
has never before been outside the door alone. It seems the servants
saw her go out, but did not think it necessary to tell either me or
Mrs. Hawke, feeling sure we must have been aware of the fact."</p>
<p>"So Mrs. Hawke has returned," said Loveday. "Well, I suppose you
will be greatly surprised if I inform you that the young lady, who
has so unceremoniously left your house, is at the present moment to
be found at the Charing Cross Hotel, where she has engaged a
private room in her real name of Miss Mary O'Grady."</p>
<p>"Eh! What! Private room! Real name O'Grady! I'm all
bewildered!"</p>
<p>"It is a little bewildering; let me explain. The young lady whom
you received into your house as the daughter of your old friend,
was in reality the person engaged by Miss Monroe to fulfill the
duties of her maid on board ship, after her native attendant had
been landed at Malta. Her real name, as I have told you, is Mary
O'Grady, and she has proved herself a valuable coadjutor to Miss
Monroe in assisting her to carry out a programme, which she must
have arranged with her lover, Mr. Danvers, before she left
Pekin."</p>
<p>"Eh! what!" again ejaculated Mr. Hawke; "how do you know all
this? Tell me the whole story."</p>
<p>"I will tell you the whole story first, and then explain to you
how I came to know it. From what has followed, it seems to me that
Miss Monroe must have arranged with Mr. Danvers that he was to
leave Pekin within ten days of her so doing, travel by the route by
which she came, and land at Plymouth, where he was to receive a
note from her, apprising him of her whereabouts. So soon as she was
on board ship, Miss Monroe appears to have set her wits to work
with great energy; every obstacle to the carrying-out of her
programme she appears to have met and conquered. Step number one
was to get rid of her native maid, who, perhaps, might have been
faithful to her master's interests and have proved troublesome. I
have no doubt the poor woman suffered terribly from sea-sickness,
as it was her first voyage, and I have equally no doubt that Miss
Monroe worked on her fears, and persuaded her to land at Malta, and
return to China by the next packet. Step number two was to find a
suitable person, who for a consideration, would be willing to play
the part of the Pekin heiress among the heiress's friends in
England, while the young lady herself arranged her private affairs
to her own liking. That person was quickly found among the steerage
passengers of the <i>Colombo</i> in Miss Mary O'Grady, who had come
on board with her mother at Ceylon, and who, from the glimpse I had
of her, must, I should conjecture, have been absent many years from
the land of her birth. You know how cleverly this young lady has
played her part in your house&mdash;how, without attracting
attention to the matter, she has shunned the society of her
father's old Chinese friends, who might be likely to involve her in
embarrassing conversations; how she has avoided the use of pen and
ink lest&mdash;"</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="306" height=
"408" src="1302211h-images/48.gif"><br>
"SO SOON AS SHE WAS ON BOARD SHIP."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," interrupted Mr. Hawke; "but, my dear Miss Brooke,
wouldn't it be as well for you and me to go at once to the Charing
Cross Hotel, and get all the information we can out of her
respecting Miss Monroe and her movements&mdash;she may be bolting,
you know?"</p>
<p>"I do not think she will. She is waiting there patiently for an
answer to a telegram she dispatched more than two hours ago to her
mother, Mrs. O'Grady, at 14, Woburn Place, Cork."</p>
<p>"Dear me! dear me! How is it possible for you to know all
this."</p>
<p>"Oh, that last little fact was simply a matter of astuteness on
the part of the man whom I have deputed to watch the young lady's
movements to-day. Other details, I assure you, in this somewhat
intricate case, have been infinitely more difficult to get at. I
think I have to thank those 'drawn daggers,' that caused you so
much consternation, for having, in the first instance, put me on
the right track."</p>
<p>"Ah&mdash;h," said Mr. Hawke, drawing a long breath; "now we
come to the daggers! I feel sure you are going to set my mind at
rest on that score."</p>
<p>"I hope so. Would it surprise you very much to be told that it
was I who sent to you those three daggers this morning?"</p>
<p>"You! Is it possible?"</p>
<p>"Yes, they were sent by me, and for a reason that I will
presently explain to you. But let me begin at the beginning. Those
roughly-drawn sketches, that to you suggested terrifying ideas of
blood-shedding and violence, to my mind were open to a more
peaceful and commonplace explanation. They appeared to me to
suggest the herald's office rather than the armoury; the cross
fitch?e of the knight's shield rather than the poniard with which
the members of secret societies are supposed to render their
recalcitrant brethren familiar. Now, if you will look at these
sketches again, you will see what I mean." Here Loveday produced
from her writing-table the missives which had so greatly disturbed
Mr. Hawke's peace of mind. "To begin with, the blade of the dagger
of common life is, as a rule, at least two-thirds of the weapon in
length; in this sketch, what you would call the blade, does not
exceed the hilt in length. Secondly, please note the absence of
guard for the hand. Thirdly, let me draw your attention to the
squareness of what you considered the hilt of the weapon, and what,
to my mind, suggested the upper portion of a crusader's cross. No
hand could grip such a hilt as the one outlined here. After your
departure yesterday, I drove to the British Museum, and there
consulted a certain valuable work on heraldry, which has more than
once done me good service. There I found my surmise substantiated
in a surprising manner. Among the illustrations of the various
crosses borne on armorial shields, I found one that had been taken
by Henri d'Anvers from his own armorial bearings, for his crest
when he joined the Crusaders under Edward I., and which has since
been handed down as the crest of the Danvers family. This was an
important item of information to me. Here was someone in Cork
sending to your house, on two several occasions, the crest of the
Danvers family; with what object it would be difficult to say,
unless it were in some sort a communication to someone in your
house. With my mind full of this idea, I left the Museum and drove
next to the office of the P. and O. Company, and requested to have
given me the list of the passengers who arrived by the
<i>Colombo</i>. I found this list to be a remarkably small one; I
suppose people, if possible, avoid crossing the Bay of Biscay
during the Equinoxes. The only passengers who landed at Plymouth
besides Miss Monroe, I found, were a certain Mrs. and Miss O'Grady,
steerage passengers who had gone on board at Ceylon on their way
home from Australia. Their name, together with their landing at
Plymouth, suggested the possibility that Cork might be their
destination. After this I asked to see the list of the passengers
who arrived by the packet following the <i>Colombo</i>, telling the
clerk who attended to me that I was on the look-out for the arrival
of a friend. In that second list of arrivals I quickly found my
friend&mdash;William Wentworth Danvers by name."</p>
<p>"No! The effrontery! How dared he! In his own name, too!"</p>
<p>"Well, you see, a plausible pretext for leaving Pekin could
easily be invented by him&mdash;the death of a relative, the
illness of a father or mother. And Sir George, though he might
dislike the idea of the young man going to England so soon after
his daughter's departure, and may, perhaps, write to you by the
next mail on the matter, was utterly powerless to prevent his so
doing. This young man, like Miss Monroe and the O'Gradys, also
landed at Plymouth. I had only arrived so far in my investigation
when I went to your house yesterday afternoon. By chance, as I
waited a few minutes in your drawing-room, another important item
of information was acquired. A fragment of conversation between
your nephew and the supposed Miss Monroe fell upon my ear, and one
word spoken by the young lady convinced me of her nationality. That
one word was the monosyllable 'Hush.'"</p>
<p>"No! You surprise me!"</p>
<p>"Have you never noted the difference between the 'hush' of an
Englishman and that of an Irishman? The former begins his 'hush'
with a distinct aspirate, the latter with as distinct a W. That W
is a mark of his nationality which he never loses. The unmitigated
'whist' may lapse into a 'whish' when he is is transplanted to
another soil, and the 'whish' may in course of time pass into a
'whush,' but to the distinct aspirate of the English 'hush,' he
never attains. Now Miss O'Grady's was as pronounced a 'whush' as it
was possible for the lips of a Hibernian to utter."</p>
<p>"And from that you concluded that Mary O'Grady was playing the
part of Miss Monroe in my house?"</p>
<p>"Not immediately. My suspicions were excited, certainly; and
when I went up to her room, in company with Mrs. Hawke's maid,
those suspicions were confirmed. The orderliness of that room was
something remarkable. Now, there is the orderliness of a lady in
the arrangement of her room, and the orderliness of a maid, and the
two things, believe me, are widely different. A lady, who has no
maid, and who has the gift of orderliness, will put things away
when done with, and so leave her room a picture of neatness. I
don't think, however, it would for a moment occur to her to pull
things so as to be conveniently ready for her to use the next time
she dresses in that room. This would be what a maid, accustomed to
arrange a room for her mistress's use, would do mechanically. Miss
Monroe's room was the neatness of a maid&mdash;not of a lady, and I
was assured by Mrs. Hawke's maid that it was a neatness
accomplished by her own hands. As I stood there, looking at that
room, the whole conspiracy&mdash;if I may so call it&mdash;little
by little pieced itself together, and became plain to me.
Possibilities quickly grew into probabilities, and these
probabilities once admitted, brought other suppositions in their
train. Now, supposing that Miss Monroe and Mary O'Grady had agreed
to change places, the Pekin heiress, for the time being, occupying
Mary O'Grady's place in the humble home at Cork and vice versa,
what means of communicating with each other had they arranged? How
was Mary O'Grady to know when she might lay aside her assumed r?le
and go back to her mother's house. There was no denying the
necessity for such communication; the difficulties in its way must
have been equally obvious to the two girls. Now, I think we must
admit that we must credit these young women with having hit upon a
very clever way of meeting those difficulties. An anonymous and
startling missive sent to you would be bound to be mentioned in the
house, and in this way a code of signals might be set up between
them that could not direct suspicion to them. In this connection,
the Danvers crest, which it is possible that they mistook for a
dagger, suggested itself naturally, for no doubt Miss Monroe had
many impressions of it on her lover's letters. As I thought over
these things, it occurred to me that possibly dagger (or cross)
number one was sent to notify the safe arrival of Miss Monroe and
Mrs. O'Grady at Cork. The two daggers or crosses you subsequently
received were sent on the day of Mr. Danvers's arrival at Plymouth,
and were, I should say, sketched by his hand. Now, was it not
within the bounds of likelihood that Miss Monroe's marriage to this
young man, and the consequent release of Mary O'Grady from the
onerous part she was playing, might be notified to her by the
sending of three such crosses or daggers to you. The idea no sooner
occurred to me than I determined to act upon it, forestall the
sending of this latest communication, and watch the result.
Accordingly, after I left your house yesterday, I had a sketch made
of three daggers of crosses exactly similar to those you had
already received, and had it posted to you so that you would get it
by the first post. I told off one of our staff at Lynch Court to
watch your house, and gave him special directions to follow and
report on Miss O'Grady's movements throughout the day. The results
I anticipated quickly came to pass. About half-past nine this
morning the man sent a telegram to me from your house to the
Charing Cross Hotel, and furthermore had ascertained that she had
since despatched a telegram, which (possibly by following the hotel
servant who carried it to the telegraph office), he had overheard
was addressed to Mrs. O'Grady, at Woburn Place, Cork. Since I
received this information an altogether remarkable cross-firing of
telegrams has been going backwards and forwards along the wires to
Cork."</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="249" height=
"381" src="1302211h-images/49.gif"><br>
A CROSS-FIRING OF TELEGRAMS.</p>
<p>"A cross-firing of telegrams! I do not understand."</p>
<p>"In this way. So soon as I knew Mrs. O'Grady's address I
telegraphed to her, in her daughter's name, desiring her to address
her reply to 1154 Gower Street, not to Charing Cross Hotel. About
three-quarters of an hour afterwards I received in reply this
telegram, which I am sure you will read with interest.</p>
<p>Here Loveday handed a telegram&mdash;one of several that lay on
her writing-table&mdash;to Mr. Hawke.</p>
<p>He opened it and read aloud as follows:</p>
<p>"Am puzzled. Why such hurry? Wedding took place this morning.
You will receive signal as agreed to-morrow. Better return to
Tavistock Square for the night."</p>
<p>"The wedding took place this morning," repeated Mr. Hawke
blankly. "My poor old friend! It will break his heart."</p>
<p>"Now that the thing is done past recall we must hope he will
make the best of it," said Loveday. "In reply to this telegram,"
she went on, "I sent another, asking as to the movements of the
bride and bridegroom, and got in reply this:"</p>
<p>Here she read aloud as follows:</p>
<p>"They will be at Plymouth to-morrow night; at Charing Cross
Hotel and next day, as agreed."</p>
<p>"So, Mr. Hawke," she added, "if you wish to see your old
friend's daughter and tell her what you think of the part she has
played, all you will have to do will be to watch the arrival of the
Plymouth trains."</p>
<p>"Miss O'Grady has called to see a lady and gentleman," said a
maid at that moment entering.</p>
<p>"Miss O'Grady!" repeated Mr. Hawke in astonishment.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, I telegraphed to her, just before you came in, to come
here to meet a lady and gentlemen, and she, no doubt thinking that
she would find here the newly-married pair, has, you see, lost no
time in complying with my request. Show the lady in."</p>
<p>"It's all so intricate&mdash;so bewildering," said Mr. Hawke, as
he lay back in his chair. "I can scarcely get it all into my
head."</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="364" height=
"336" src="1302211h-images/50.gif"><br>
"IT'S ALL SO INTRICATE&mdash;SO BEWILDERING," SAID MR. HAWKE.</p>
<p>His bewilderment, however, was nothing compared with that of
Miss O'Grady, when she entered the room and found herself face to
face with her late guardian, instead of the radiant bride and
bridegroom whom she had expected to meet.</p>
<p>She stood silent in the middle of the room, looking the picture
of astonishment and distress.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawke also seemed a little at a loss for words, so Loveday
took the initiative.</p>
<p>"Please sit down," she said, placing a chair for the girl. "Mr.
Hawke and I have sent to you in order to ask you a few questions.
Before doing so, however, let me tell you that the whole of your
conspiracy with Miss Monroe has been brought to light, and the best
thing you can do, if you want your share in it treated leniently,
will be to answer our questions as fully and truthfully as
possible."</p>
<p>The girl burst into tears. "It was all Miss Monroe's fault from
beginning to end," she sobbed. "Mother didn't want to do it&mdash;I
didn't want to&mdash;to go into a gentleman's house and pretend to
be what I was not. And we didn't want her hundred
pounds&mdash;"</p>
<p>Here sobs checked her speech.</p>
<p>"Oh," said Loveday contemptuously, "so you were to have a
hundred pounds for your share in this fraud, were you?"</p>
<p>"We didn't want to take it," said the girl, between hysterical
bursts of tears; "but Miss Monroe said if we didn't help her
someone else would, and so I agreed to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I think," interrupted Loveday, "that you can tell us very
little that we do not already know about what you agreed to do.
What we want you to tell us is what has been done with Miss
Monroe's diamond necklace&mdash;who has possession of it now?"</p>
<p>The girl's sobs and tears redoubled. "I've had nothing to do
with the necklace&mdash;it has never been in my possession," she
sobbed. "Miss Monroe gave it to Mr. Danvers two or three months
before she left Pekin, and he sent it on to some people he knew in
Hong Kong, diamond merchants, who lent him money on it. Decastro,
Miss Monroe said, was the name of these people."</p>
<p>"Decastro, diamond merchant, Hong Kong. I should think that
would be sufficient address," said Loveday, entering it in a
ledger; "and I suppose Mr. Danvers retained part of that money for
his own use and travelling expenses, and handed the remainder to
Miss Monroe to enable her to bribe such creatures as you and your
mother, to practice a fraud that ought to land both of you in
jail."</p>
<p>The girl grew deadly white. "Oh, don't do that&mdash;don't send
us to prison!" she implored, clasping her hands together. "We
haven't touched a penny of Miss Monroe's money yet, and we don't
want to touch a penny, if you'll only let us off! Oh, pray, pray,
pray be merciful!"</p>
<p>Loveday looked at Mr. Hawke.</p>
<p>He rose from his chair. "I think the best thing you can do," he
said, "will be to get back home to your mother at Cork as quickly
as possible, and advise her never to play such a risky game again.
Have you any money in your purse? No&mdash;well then here's some
for you, and lose no time in getting home. It will be best for Miss
Monroe&mdash;Mrs. Danvers I mean&mdash;to come to my house and
claim her own property there. At any rate, there it will remain
until she does so."</p>
<p>As the girl, with incoherent expressions of gratitude, left the
room, he turned to Loveday.</p>
<p>"I should like to have consulted Mrs. Hawke before arranging
matters in this way," he said a little hesitatingly; "but still, I
don't see that I could have done otherwise."</p>
<p>"I feel sure Mrs. Hawke will approve what you have done when she
hears all the circumstance of the case," said Loveday.</p>
<p>"And," continued the old clergyman, "when I write to Sir George,
as, of course, I must immediately, I shall advise him to make the
best of a bad bargain, now that the thing is done. 'Past cure
should be past care;' eh, Miss Brooke? And, think! what a narrow
escape my nephew, Jack, has had!"</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="VI" id="VI"><i>THE GHOST OF FOUNTAIN
LANE.</i></a></h3>
<p>"W<small>ILL</small> you be good enough to tell me how you
procured my address?" said Miss Brooke, a little irritably. "I left
strict orders that it was to be given to no one."</p>
<p>"I only obtained it with great difficulty from Mr. Dyer; had, in
fact, to telegraph three times before I could get it," answered Mr.
Clampe, the individual thus addressed. "I'm sure I'm awfully sorry
to break into your holiday in this fashion, but&mdash;but pardon me
if I say that it seems to be one in little more than name." Here he
glanced meaningly at the newspapers, memoranda and books of
reference with which the table at which Loveday sat was strewn.</p>
<p>She gave a little sigh.</p>
<p>"I suppose you are right," she answered; "it is a holiday in
little more than name. I verily believe that we hard workers, after
a time, lose our capacity for holiday-keeping. I thought I was
pining for a week of perfect laziness and sea-breezes, and so I
locked up my desk and fled. No sooner, however, do I find myself in
full view of that magnificent sea-and-sky picture than I shut my
eyes to it, fasten them instead on the daily papers and set my
brains to work, <i>con amore</i>, on a ridiculous case that is
never likely to come into my hands."</p>
<p>That "magnificent sea-and-sky picture" was one framed by the
windows of a room on the fifth floor of the M?tropole, at Brighton,
whither Loveday, overtaxed in mind and body, had fled for a brief
respite from hard work. Here Inspector Clampe, of the Local
District Constabulary, had found her out, in order to press the
claims of what seemed to him an important case upon her. He was a
neat, dapper-looking man, of about fifty, with a manner less
brusque and business-like than that of most men in his
profession.</p>
<p>"Oh pray drop the ridiculous case," he said earnestly, "and set
to work, <i>'con amore</i>,' upon another far from ridiculous, and
most interesting."</p>
<p>"I'm not sure that it would interest me one quarter so much as
the ridiculous one."</p>
<p>"Don't be sure till you've heard the particulars. Listen to
this." Here the inspector took a newspaper-cutting from his
pocket-book and read aloud as follows:</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="231" height=

"LISTEN TO THIS."</p>
<p>"'A cheque, the property of the Rev. Charles Turner, Vicar of
East Downes, has been stolen under somewhat peculiar circumstances.
It appears that the Rev. gentleman was suddenly called from home by
the death of a relative, and thinking he might possibly be away
some little time, he left with his wife four blank cheques, signed,
for her to fill in as required. They were made payable to self or
bearer, and were drawn on the West Sussex Bank. Mrs. Turner, when
first questioned on the matter, stated that as soon as her husband
had departed, she locked up these cheques in her writing desk. She
subsequently, however, corrected this statement, and admitted
having left them on the table while she went into the garden to cut
some flowers. In all, she was absent, she says, about ten minutes.
When she came in from cutting her flowers, she immediately put the
cheques away. She had not counted them on receiving them from her
husband, and when, as she put them into her Davenport, she saw
there were only three, she concluded that that was the number he
had left with her. The loss of the cheque was not discovered until
her husband's return, about a week later on. As soon as he was
aware of the fact, he telegraphed to the West Sussex Bank to stop
payment, only, however, to make the unpleasant discovery that the
cheque, filled in to the amount of six hundred pounds, had been
presented and cashed (in gold) two days previously. The clerk who
cashed it took no particular notice of the person presenting it,
except that he was of gentlemanly appearance, and declares himself
to be quite incapable of identifying him. The largeness of the
amount raised no suspicion in the mind of the clerk, as Mr. Turner
is a man of good means, and since his marriage, about six months
back, has been refurnishing the Vicarage, and paying away large
sums for old oak furniture and for pictures.'"</p>
<p>"There, Miss Brooke," said the inspector as he finished reading,
"if, in addition to these particulars, I tell you that one or two
circumstances that have arisen seem to point suspicion in the
direction of the young wife, I feel sure you will admit that a more
interesting case, and one more worthy of your talents, is not to be
found."</p>
<p>Loveday's answer was to take up a newspaper that lay beside her
on the table. "So much for your interesting case," she said; "now
listen to my ridiculous one." Then she read aloud as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Authentic Ghost Story.&mdash;The inhabitants of Fountain Lane,
a small turning leading off Ship Street, have been greatly
disturbed by the sudden appearance of a ghost in their midst. Last
Tuesday night, between ten and eleven o'clock, a little girl named
Martha Watts, who lives as a help to a shoemaker and his wife at
No. 5 in the lane, ran out into the streets in her night-clothes in
a great state of terror, saying that a ghost had come to her
bedside. The child refused to return to the house to sleep, and was
accordingly taken in by some neighbours. The shoemaker and his
wife, Freer by name, when questioned by the neighbours on the
matter, admitted, with great reluctance, that they, too, had seen
the apparition, which they described as being a soldier-like
individual, with a broad, white forehead and having his arms folded
on his breast. This description is, in all respects confirmed by
the child, Martha Watts, who asserts that the ghost she saw
reminded her of pictures she had seen of the great Napoleon. The
Freers state that it first appeared in the course of a
prayer-meeting held at their house on the previous night, when it
was distinctly seen by Mr. Freer. Subsequently, the wife, awakening
suddenly in the middle of the night, saw the apparition standing at
the foot of the bed. They are quite at a loss for an explanation of
the matter. The affair has caused quite a sensation in the
district, and at the time of going to press, the lane is so
thronged and crowded by would-be ghost-seers that the inhabitants
have great difficulty in going to and from their houses.'"</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="246" height=
"340" src="1302211h-images/52.gif"><br>
IN A GREAT STATE OF TERROR.</p>
<p>"A scare&mdash;a vulgar scare, nothing more," said the inspector
as Loveday laid aside the paper. "Now, Miss Brooke, I ask you
seriously, supposing you get to the bottom of such a stupid,
commonplace fraud as that, will you in any way add to your
reputation?"</p>
<p>"And supposing I get to the bottom of such a stupid, commonplace
fraud as a stolen cheque, how much, I should like to know, do I add
to my reputation?"</p>
<p>"Well, put it on other grounds and allow Christian charity to
have some claims. Think of the misery in that gentleman's house
unless suspicion can be lifted from the young wife and directed to
the proper quarter."</p>
<p>"Think of the misery of the landlord of the Fountain Lane houses
if all his tenants decamp in a body, as they no doubt will, unless
the ghost mystery is solved."</p>
<p>The inspector sighed. "Well, I suppose I must take it for
granted that you will have nothing to do with the case," he said.
"I brought the cheque with me, thinking you might like to see
it."</p>
<p>"I suppose it's very much like other cheques?" said Loveday
indifferently, and turning over her memoranda as if she meant to go
back to her ghost again.</p>
<p>"Ye&mdash;es," said Mr. Clampe, taking the cheque from his
pocket-book and glancing down at it. "I suppose the cheque is very
much like other cheques. This little scribble of figures in pencil
at the back&mdash;144,000&mdash;can scarcely be called a
distinguishing mark."</p>
<p>"What's that, Mr. Clampe?" asked Loveday, pushing her memoranda
on one side. "144,000 did you say?"</p>
<p>Her whole manner had suddenly changed from apathy to that of
keenest interest.</p>
<p>Mr. Clampe, delighted, rose and spread the cheque before her on
the table.</p>
<p>"The writing of the words "six hundred pounds," he said, "bears
so close a resemblance to Mr. Turner's signature, that the
gentleman himself told me he would have thought it was his own
writing if he had not known that he had not drawn a cheque for that
amount on the given date. You see it is that round, school-boy's
hand, so easy to imitate, I could write it myself with
half-an-hour's practice; no flourishes, nothing distinctive about
it."</p>
<p>Loveday made no reply. She had turned the cheque, and was now
closely scrutinizing the pencilled figures at the back.</p>
<p>"Of course," continued the inspector, "those figures were not
written by the person who wrote the figures on the face of the
cheque. That, however, matters but little. I really do not think
they are of the slightest importance in the case. They might have
been scribbled by some one making a calculation as to the number of
pennies in six hundred pounds&mdash;there are, as no doubt you
know, exactly 144,000."</p>
<p>"Who has engaged your services in this case, the Bank or Mr.
Turner?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Turner. When the loss of the cheque was first discovered,
he was very excited and irate, and when he came to me the day
before yesterday, I had much difficulty in persuading him that
there was no need to telegraph to London for half-a-dozen
detectives, as we could do the work quite as well as the London
men. When, however, I went over to East Downes yesterday to look
round and ask a few questions; I found things had altogether
changed. He was exceedingly reluctant to answer any questions, lost
his temper when I pressed them, and as good as told me that he
wished he had not moved in the matter at all. It was this sudden
change of demeanour that turned my thoughts in the direction of
Mrs. Turner. A man must have a very strong reason for wishing to
sit idle under a loss of six hundred pounds, for, of course, under
the circumstances, the Bank will not bear the brunt of it."</p>
<p>"Some other motives may be at work in his mind, consideration
for old servants, the wish to avoid a scandal in the house."</p>
<p>"Quite so. The fact, taken by itself, would give no ground for
suspicion, but certainly looks ugly if taken in connection with
another fact which I have since ascertained, namely, that during
her husband's absence from home, Mrs. Turner paid off certain debts
contracted by her in Brighton before the marriage, and amounting to
nearly ?500. Paid them off, too, in gold. I think I mentioned to
you that the gentleman who presented the stolen cheque at the Bank
preferred payment in gold."</p>
<p>"You are supposing not only a confederate, but also a vast
amount of cunning as well as of simplicity on the lady's part."</p>
<p>"Quite so. Three parts cunning to one of simplicity is precisely
what lady criminals are composed of. And it is, as a rule, that one
part of simplicity that betrays them and leads to their
detection."</p>
<p>"What sort of woman is Mrs. Turner in other respects?"</p>
<p>"She is young, handsome and of good birth, but is scarcely
suited for the position of vicar's wife in a country parish. She
has lived a good deal in society and is fond of gaiety, and, in
addition, is a Roman Catholic, and, I am told, utterly ignores her
husband's church and drives every Sunday to Brighton to attend
mass."</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="347" height=
"370" src="1302211h-images/53.gif"><br>
"DRIVES EVERY SUNDAY TO ATTEND MASS."</p>
<p>"What about the servants in the house? Do they seem steady-going
and respectable?"</p>
<p>"There was nothing on the surface to excite suspicion against
any one of them. But it is precisely in that quarter than your
services would be invaluable. It will, however, be impossible to
get you inside the vicarage walls. Mr. Turner, I am confident,
would never open his doors to you."</p>
<p>"What do you suggest?"</p>
<p>"I can suggest nothing better than the house of the village
schoolmistress, or, rather, of the village schoolmistress's mother,
Mrs. Brown. It is only a stone's throw from the vicarage; in fact,
its windows overlook the vicarage grounds. It is a four-roomed
cottage, and Mrs. Brown, who is a very respectable person, turns
over a little money in the summer by receiving lady lodgers
desirous of a breath of country air. There would be no difficulty
in getting you in there; her spare bedroom is empty now."</p>
<p>"I should have preferred being at the vicarage, but if it cannot
be, I must make the most of my stay at Mrs. Brown's. How do we get
there?'"</p>
<p>"I drove from East Downes here in a trap I hired at the village
inn where I put up last night, and where I shall stay to-night. I
will drive you, if you will allow me; it is only seven miles off.
It's a lovely day for a drive; breezy and not too much dust. Could
you be ready in about half an hour's time, say?"</p>
<p>But this, Loveday said, would be an impossibility. She had a
special engagement that afternoon; there was a religious service in
the town that she particularly wished to attend. It would not be
over until three o'clock, and, consequently, not until half-past
three would she be ready for the drive to East Downes.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Clampe looked unutterable astonishment at the
claims of a religious service being set before those of
professional duty, he made no demur to the arrangement, and
accordingly half-past three saw Loveday and the inspector in a
high-wheeled dog-cart rattling along the Marina in the direction of
East Downes.</p>
<p>Loveday made no further allusion to her ghost story, so Mr.
Clampe, out of politeness, felt compelled to refer to it.</p>
<p>"I heard all about the Fountain Lane ghost yesterday, before I
started for East Downes," he said; "and it seemed to me, with all
deference to you, Miss Brooke, an every-day sort of affair, the
sort of thing to be explained by a heavy supper or an extra glass
of beer."</p>
<p>"There are a few points in this ghost story that separate it
from the every-day ghost story," answered Loveday. "For instance,
you would expect that such emotionally religious people, as I have
since found the Freers to be, would have seen a vision of angels,
or at least a solitary saint. Instead, they see a soldier! A
soldier, too, in the likeness of a man who is anathema maranatha to
every religious mind&mdash;the great Napoleon."</p>
<p>"To what denomination do the Freers belong?"</p>
<p>"To the Wesleyan. Their fathers and mothers before them were
Wesleyans; their relatives and friends are Wesleyans, one and all,
they say; and, most important item of all, the man's boot and shoe
connection lies exclusively among Wesleyan ministers. This, he told
me, is the most paying connection that a small boot-maker can have.
Half-a-dozen Wesleyan ministers pay better than three times the
number of Church clergy, for whereas the Wesleyan minister is
always on the tramp among his people, the clergyman generally
contrives in the country to keep a horse, or else turns student,
and shuts himself up in his study."</p>
<p>"Ha, ha! Capital," laughed Mr. Clampe; "tell that to the Church
Defence Society in Wales. Isn't this a first-rate little horse? In
another ten minutes we shall be in sight of East Downes."</p>
<p>The long, dusty road down which they had driven, was ending now
in a narrow, sloping lane, hedged in on either side with hawthorns
and wild plum trees. Through these, the August sunshine was
beginning to slant now, and from a distant wood there came a faint
sound of fluting and piping, as if the blackbirds were thinking of
tuning up for their evening carols.</p>
<p>A sudden, sharp curve in this lane brought them in sight of East
Downes, a tiny hamlet of about thirty cottages, dominated by the
steeple of a church of early English architecture. Adjoining the
church was the vicarage, a goodly-sized house, with extensive
grounds, and in a lane running alongside these grounds were
situated the village schools and the schoolmistress's house. The
latter was simply a four-roomed cottage, standing in a pretty
garden, with cluster roses and honeysuckle, now in the fullness of
their August glory, climbing upwards to its very roof.</p>
<p>Outside this cottage Mr. Clampe drew rein.</p>
<p>"If you'll give me five minutes' grace," he said, "I'll go in
and tell the good woman that I have brought her, as a lodger, a
friend of mine, who is anxious to get away for a time from the
noise and glare of Brighton. Of course, the story of the stolen
cheque is all over the place, but I don't think anyone has, at
present, connected me with the affair. I am supposed to be a
gentleman from Brighton, who is anxious to buy a horse the Vicar
wishes to sell, and who can't quite arrange terms with him."</p>
<p>While Loveday waited outside in the cart, an open carriage drove
past and then in through the vicarage gates. In the carriage were
seated a gentleman and lady whom, from the respectful greetings
they received from the village children, she conjectured to be the
Rev. Charles and Mrs. Turner. Mr. Turner was sanguine-complexioned,
red-haired, and wore a distinctly troubled expression of
countenance. With Mrs. Turner's appearance Loveday was not
favourably impressed. Although a decidedly handsome woman, she was
hard-featured and had a scornful curl to her upper lip. She was
dressed in the extreme of London fashion.</p>
<p>They threw a look of enquiry at Loveday as they passed, and she
felt sure that enquiries as to the latest addition to Mrs. Brown's
m?nage would soon be afloat in the village.</p>
<p>Mr. Clampe speedily returned, saying that Mrs. Brown was only
too delighted to get her spare-room occupied. He whispered a hint
as they made their way up to the cottage door between borders
thickly planted with stocks and mignonette.</p>
<p>It was:</p>
<p>"Don't ask her any questions, or she'll draw herself up as
straight as a ramrod, and say she never listens to gossip of any
sort. But just let her alone, and she'll run on like a mill-stream,
and tell you as much as you'll want to know about everyone and
everything. She and the village postmistress are great friends, and
between them they contrive to know pretty much what goes on inside
every house in the place."</p>
<p>Mrs. Brown was a stout, rosy-cheeked woman of about fifty,
neatly dressed in a dark stuff gown with a big white cap and apron.
She welcomed Loveday respectfully, and introduced, evidently with a
little pride, her daughter, the village schoolmistress, a
well-spoken young woman of about eight-and-twenty.</p>
<p>Mr. Clampe departed with his dog-cart to the village inn,
announcing his intention of calling on Loveday at the cottage on
the following morning before he returned to Brighton.</p>
<p>Miss Brown also departed, saying she would prepare tea. Left
alone with Loveday, Mrs. Brown speedily unloosed her tongue. She
had a dozen questions to ask respecting Mr. Clampe and his business
in the village. Now, was it true that he had come to East Downes
for the whole and sole purpose of buying one of the Vicar's horses?
She had heard it whispered that he had been sent by the police to
watch the servants at the vicarage. She hoped it was not true, for
a more respectable set of servants were not to be met with in any
house, far or near. Had Miss Brooke heard about that lost cheque?
Such a terrible affair! She had been told that the story of it had
reached London. Now, had Miss Brooke seen an account of it in any
of the London papers?</p>
<p>Here a reply from Loveday in the negative formed a sufficient
excuse for relating with elaborate detail the story of the stolen
cheque. Except in its elaborateness of detail, it differed but
little from the one Loveday had already heard.</p>
<p>She listened patiently, bearing in mind Mr. Clampe's hint, and
asking no questions. And when, in about a quarter of an hour's
time, Miss Brown came in with the tea-tray in her hand, Loveday
could have passed an examination in the events of the daily family
life at the vicarage. She could have answered questions as to the
ill-assortedness of the newly-married couple; she knew that they
wrangled from morning till night; that the chief subjects of their
disagreement were religion and money matters; that the Vicar was
hot-tempered, and said whatever came to the tip of his tongue; that
the beautiful young wife, though slower of speech, was scathing and
sarcastic, and that, in addition, she was wildly extravagant and
threw money away in all directions.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="262" height=
"341" src="1302211h-images/54.gif"><br>
MISS BROWN CAME IN WITH THE TEA-TRAY.</p>
<p>In addition to these interesting facts, Loveday could have
undertaken to supply information respecting the number of servants
at the vicarage, together with their names, ages and respective
duties.</p>
<p>During tea, conversation flagged somewhat; Miss Brown's presence
evidently acted repressively on her mother, and it was not until
the meal was over and Loveday was being shown to her room by Mrs.
Brown that opportunity to continue the talk was found.</p>
<p>Loveday opened the ball by remarking on the fact that no
Dissenting chapel was to be found in the village.</p>
<p>"Generally, wherever there is a handful of cottages, we find a
church at one end and a chapel at the other," she said; "but here,
willy-nilly, one must go to church."</p>
<p>"Do you belong to chapel, ma'am?" was Mrs. Brown's reply. "Old
Mrs. Turner, the Vicar's mother, who died over a year ago, was so
'low' she was almost chapel, and used often to drive over to
Brighton to attend the Countess of Huntingdon's church. People used
to say that was bad enough in the Vicar's mother; but what was it
compared with what goes on now&mdash;the Vicar's wife driving
regularly every Sunday into Brighton to a Catholic Church to say
her prayers to candles and images? I'm glad you like the room,
ma'am. Feather bolster, feather pillows, do you see, ma'am? I've
nothing in the way of flock or wool on either of my beds to make
people's head ache." Here Mrs. Brown, by way of emphasis, patted
and pinched the fat pillows and bolster showing above the spotless
white counterpane.</p>
<p>Loveday stood at the cottage window drinking in the sweetness of
the country air, laden now with the heavy evening scents of
carnation and essamine. Across the road, from the vicarage, came
the loud clanging of a dinner-gong, and almost simultaneously the
church clock chimed the hour&mdash;seven o'clock.</p>
<p>"Who is that person coming up the lane?" asked Loveday, her
attention suddenly attracted by a tall, thin figure, dressed in
shabby black, with a large, dowdyish bonnet, and carrying a basket
in her hand as if she were returning from some errand. Mrs. Brown
peeped over Loveday's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Ah, that's the peculiar young woman I was telling you about,
ma'am&mdash;Maria Lisle, who used to be old Mrs. Turner's maid. Not
that she is over young now; she's five-and-thirty if she's a day.
The Vicar kept her on to be his wife's maid after the old lady
died, but young Mrs. Turner will have nothing to do with her, she's
not good enough for her; so Mr. Turner is just paying her ?30 a
year for doing nothing. And what Maria does with all that money it
would be hard to say. She doesn't spend it on dress, that's
certain, and she hasn't kith nor kin, not a soul belonging to her
to give a penny to."</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="127" height=
"343" src="1302211h-images/55.gif"><br>
MARIA LISLE.</p>
<p>"Perhaps she gives it to charities in Brighton. There are plenty
of outlets for money there."</p>
<p>"She may," said Mrs. Brown dubiously; "she is always going to
Brighton whenever she gets a chance. She used to be a Wesleyan in
old Mrs. Turner's time, and went regularly to all the revival
meetings for miles round; what she is now, it would be hard to say.
Where she goes to church in Brighton, no one knows. She drives over
with Mrs. Turner every Sunday, but everyone knows nothing would
induce her to go near the candles and images. Thomas&mdash;that's
the coachman&mdash;says he puts her down at the corner of a dirty
little street in mid-Brighton, and there he picks her up again
after he has fetched Mrs. Turner from her church. No, there's
something very queer in her ways."</p>
<p>Maria passed in through the lodge gates of the vicarage. She
walked with her head bent, her eyes cast down to the ground.</p>
<p>"Something very queer in her ways," repeated Mrs. Brown. "She
never speaks to a soul unless they speak first to her, and gets by
herself on every possible opportunity. Do you see that old
summer-house over there in the vicarage grounds&mdash;it stands
between the orchard and kitchen garden&mdash;well, every evening at
sunset, out comes Maria and disappears into it, and there she stays
for over an hour at a time. And what she does there goodness only
knows!"</p>
<p>"Perhaps she keeps books there, and studies."</p>
<p>"Studies! My daughter showed her some new books that had come
down for the fifth standard the other day, and Maria turned upon
her and said quite sharply that there was only one book in the
whole world that people ought to study, and that book was the
Bible."</p>
<p>"How pretty those vicarage gardens are," said Loveday, a little
abruptly. "Does the Vicar ever allow people to see them?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, miss; he doesn't at all mind people taking a walk
round them. Only yesterday he said to me, 'Mrs. Brown, if ever you
feel yourself circumscribed'&mdash;yes, 'circumscribed' was the
word&mdash;'just walk out of your garden-gate and in at mine and
enjoy yourself at your leisure among my fruit-trees.' Not that I
would like to take advantage of his kindness and make too free; but
if you'd care, ma'am, to go for a walk through the grounds, I'll go
with you with pleasure. There's a wonderful old cedar hard by the
pond people have come ever so far to see."</p>
<p>"It's that old summer-house and little bit of orchard that
fascinate me," said Loveday, putting on her hat.</p>
<p>"We shall frighten Maria to death if she sees us so near her
haunt," said Mrs. Brown as she led the way downstairs. "This way,
if you please, ma'am, the kitchen-garden leads straight into the
orchard."</p>
<p>Twilight was deepening rapidly into night now. Bird notes had
ceased, the whirr of insects, the croaking of a distant frog were
the only sounds that broke the evening stillness.</p>
<p>As Mrs. Brown swung back the gate that divided the
kitchen-garden from the orchard, the gaunt, black figure of Maria
Lisle was seen approaching in an opposite direction.</p>
<p>"Well, really, I don't see why she should expect to have the
orchard all to herself every evening," said Mrs. Brown, with a
little toss of her head. "Mind the gooseberry bushes, ma'am, they
do catch at your clothes so. My word! what a fine show of fruit the
Vicar has this year! I never saw pear trees more laden!"</p>
<p>They were now in the "bit of orchard" to be seen from the
cottage windows. As they rounded the corner of the path in which
the old summer-house stood, Maria Lisle turned its corner at the
farther end, and suddenly found herself almost face to face with
them. If her eyes and not been so persistently fastened on the
ground, she would have noted the approach of the intruders as
quickly as they had noted hers. Now, as she saw them for the first
time, she gave a sudden start, paused for a moment irresolutely,
and then turned sharply and walked rapidly away in an opposite
direction.</p>
<p>"Maria, Maria!" called Mrs. Brown, "don't run away; we sha'n't
stay here for more than a minute or so."</p>
<p>Her words met with no response. The woman did not so much as
turn her head.</p>
<p>Loveday stood at the entrance of the old summer-house. It was
considerably out of repair, and most probably was never entered by
anyone save Maria Lisle, its unswept, undusted condition suggesting
colonies of spiders and other creeping things within.</p>
<p>Loveday braved them all and took her seat on the bench that ran
round the little place in a semi-circle.</p>
<p>"Do try and overtake the girl, and tell her we shall be gone in
a minute," she said, addressing Mrs. Brown. "I will wait here
meanwhile. I am so sorry to have frightened her away in that
fashion."</p>
<p>Mrs. Brown, under protest, and with a little grumble at the
ridiculousness of "people who couldn't look other people in the
face," set off in pursuit of Maria.</p>
<p>It was getting dim inside the summer-house now. There was,
however, sufficient light to enable Loveday to discover a small
packet of books lying in a corner of the bench on which she
sat.</p>
<p>One by one she took them in her hand and closely scrutinized
them. The first was a much read and pencil-marked Bible; the others
were respectively, a "congregational hymn-book," a book in a paper
cover, on which was printed a flaming picture of a red and yellow
angel, pouring blood and fire from out a big black bottle, and
entitled "The End of the Age," and a smaller book, also in a paper
cover, on which was depicted a huge black horse, snorting fire and
brimstone into ochre-coloured clouds. This book was entitled "The
Year Book of the Saints," and was simply a ruled diary with
sensational mottoes for every day in the year. In parts, this diary
was filled in with large and very untidy handwriting.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="240" height=
"298" src="1302211h-images/56.gif"><br>
THE FIRST WAS A PENCIL-MARKED BIBLE.</p>
<p>In these books seemed to lie the explanation of Maria Lisle's
love of evening solitude and the lonely old summer-house.</p>
<p>Mrs. Brown pursued Maria to the servants' entrance to the house,
but could not overtake her, the girl making good her retreat
there.</p>
<p>She returned to Loveday a little hot, a little breathless and a
little out of temper. It was all so absurd, she said; why couldn't
the woman have stayed and had a chat with them? It wasn't as if she
would get any harm out of the talk; she knew as well as everyone
else in the village that she (Mrs. Brown) was no idle gossip,
tittle-tattling over other people's affairs.</p>
<p>But here Loveday, a little sharply, cut short her
meanderings.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Brown," she said, and to Mrs. Brown's fancy her voice and
manner had entirely changed from that of the pleasant, chatty lady
of half-an-hour ago, "I'm sorry to say it will be impossible for me
to stay even one night in your pleasant home, I have just
recollected some important business that I must transact in
Brighton to-night. I haven't unpacked my portmanteau, so if you'll
kindly have it taken to your garden-gate, I'll call for it as we
drive past&mdash;I am going now, at once, to the inn, to see if Mr.
Clampe can drive me back into Brighton to-night."</p>
<p>Mrs. Brown had no words ready wherewith to express her
astonishment, and Loveday assuredly gave her no time to hunt for
them. Ten minutes later saw her rousing Mr. Clampe from a
comfortable supper, to which he had just settled himself, with the
surprising announcement that she must get back to Brighton with as
little delay as possible; now, would he be good enough to drive her
there?</p>
<p>"We'll have a pair if they are to be had," she added. "The road
is good; it will be moonlight in a quarter of an hour; we ought to
do it in less than half the time we took coming."</p>
<p>While a phaeton and pair were being got ready, Loveday had time
for a few words of explanation.</p>
<p>Maria Lisle's diary in the old summer-house had given her the
last of the links in her chain of evidence that was to bring the
theft of the cheque home to the criminal.</p>
<p>"It will be best to drive straight to the police station," she
said; "they must take out three warrants, one for Maria Lisle, and
two others respectively for Richard Steele, late Wesleyan minister
of a chapel in Gordon Street, Brighton, and John Rogers, formerly
elder of the same chapel. And let me tell you," she added with a
little smile, "that these three worthies would most likely have
been left at large to carry on their depredations for some little
time to come if it had not been for that ridiculous ghost in
Fountain Lane."</p>
<p>More than this there was not time to add, and when, a few
minutes later, the two were rattling along the road to Brighton,
the presence of the man, whom they were forced to take with them in
order to bring back the horses to East Downes, prevented any but
the most jerky and fragmentary of additions to this brief
explanation.</p>
<p>"I very much fear that John Rogers has bolted," once Loveday
whispered under her breath.</p>
<p>And again, a little later, when a smooth bit of road admitted of
low-voiced talk, she said:</p>
<p>"We can't wait for the warrant for Steele; they must follow us
with it to 15, Draycott Street."</p>
<p>"But I want to know about the ghost," said Mr. Clampe; "I am
deeply interested in that 'ridiculous ghost.'"</p>
<p>"Wait till we get to 15, Draycott Street," was Loveday's reply;
"when you've been there, I feel sure you will understand
everything."</p>
<p>Church clocks were chiming a quarter to nine as they drove
through Kemp Town at a pace that made the passers-by imagine they
must be bound on an errand of life and death.</p>
<p>Loveday did not alight at the police station, and five minutes'
talk with the inspector in charge there was all that Mr. Clampe
required to put things en train for the arrest of the three
criminals.</p>
<p>It had evidently been an "excursionists' day" at Brighton. The
streets leading to the railway station were thronged, and their
progress along the bye streets was impeded by the overflow of
traffic from the main road.</p>
<p>"We shall get along better on foot; Draycott Street is only a
stone's throw from here," said Loveday; "there's a turning on the
north side of Western Road that will bring us straight into
it."</p>
<p>So they dismissed their trap, and Loveday, acting as cicerone
still, led the way through narrow turnings into the district, half
town, half country, that skirts the road leading to the Dyke.</p>
<p>Draycott Street was not difficult to find. It consisted of two
rows of newly-built houses of the eight-roomed, lodging-letting
order. A dim light shone from the first-floor windows of number
fifteen, but the lower window was dark and uncurtained, and a board
hanging from its balcony rails proclaimed that it was "to let
unfurnished." The door of the house stood slightly ajar, and
pushing it open, Loveday led the way up a flight of
stairs&mdash;lighted halfway up with a paraffin lamp&mdash;to the
first floor.</p>
<p>"I know the way. I was here this afternoon," she whispered to
her companion. "This is the last lecture he will give before he
starts for Judaea; or, in other words, bolts with the money he has
managed to conjure from other people's purses into his own."</p>
<p>The door of the room for which they were making, on the first
floor, stood open, possibly on account of the heat. It laid bare to
view a double row of forms, on which were seated some eight or ten
persons in the attitude of all-absorbed listeners. Their faces were
upturned, as if fixed on a preacher at the farther end of the room,
and wore that expression of rapt, painful interest that is
sometimes seen on the faces of a congregation of revivalists before
the smouldering excitement bursts into flame.</p>
<p>As Loveday and her companion mounted the last of the flight of
stairs, the voice of the preacher&mdash;full, arrestive,
resonant&mdash;fell upon their ear; and, standing on the small
outside landing, it was possible to catch a glimpse of that
preacher through the crack of the half-opened door.</p>
<p>He was a tall, dignified-looking man, of about five-and-forty,
with a close crop of white hair, black eye-brows and remarkably
luminous and expressive eyes. Altogether his appearance matched his
voice: it was emphatically that of a man born to sway, lead, govern
the multitude.</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="201" height=
"351" src="1302211h-images/57.gif"><br>
A MAN BORN TO SWAY.</p>
<p>A boy came out of an adjoining room and asked Loveday
respectfully if she would not like to go in and hear the lecture.
She shook her head.</p>
<p>"I could not stand the heat," she said. "Kindly bring us chairs
here."</p>
<p>The lecture was evidently drawing to a close now, and Loveday
and Mr. Clampe, as they sat outside listening, could not resist an
occasional thrill of admiration at the skilful manner in which the
preacher led his hearers from one figure of rhetoric to another,
until the oratorical climax was reached.</p>
<p>"That man is a born orator," whispered Loveday; "and in addition
to the power of the voice has the power of the eye. That audience
is as completely hypnotized by him as if they had surrendered
themselves to a professional mesmerist."</p>
<p>To judge from the portion of the discourse that fell upon their
ear, the preacher was a member of one of the many sects known under
the generic name, "Millenarian." His topic was Apollyon and the
great battle of Armageddon. This he described as vividly as if it
were being fought out under his very eye, and it would scarcely be
an exaggeration to say that he made the cannon roar in the ears of
his listeners and the tortured cries of the wounded wail in them.
He drew an appalling picture of the carnage of that battlefield, of
the blood flowing like a river across the plain, of the mangled men
and horses, with the birds of prey swooping down from all quarters,
and the stealthy tigers and leopards creeping out from their
mountain lairs. "And all this time," he said, suddenly raising his
voice from a whisper to a full, thrilling tone, "gazing calmly down
upon the field of slaughter, with bent brows and folded arms,
stands the imperial Apollyon. Apollyon did I say? No, I will give
him his right name, the name in which he will stand revealed in
that dread day, Napoleon! A Napoleon it will be who, in that day,
will stand as the embodiment of Satanic majesty. Out of the mists
suddenly he will walk, a tall, dark figure, with frowning brows and
firm-set lips. A man to rule, a man to drive, a man to kill!
Apollyon the mighty, Napoleon the imperial, they are one and the
same&mdash;"</p>
<p>Here a sob and a choking cry from one of the women in the front
seats interrupted the discourse and sent the small boy who acted as
verger into the room with a glass of water.</p>
<p>"That sermon has been preached before," said Loveday. "Now can
you not understand the origin of the ghost in Fountain Lane?"</p>
<p>"Hysterics are catching, there's another woman off now," said
Mr. Clampe; "it's high time this sort of thing was put a stop to.
Pearson ought to be here in another minute with his warrant."</p>
<p>The words had scarcely passed his lips before heavy steps
mounting the stairs announced that Pearson and his warrant were at
hand.</p>
<p>"I don't think I can be of any further use," said Loveday,
rising to depart. "If you like to come to me to-morrow morning at
my hotel at ten o'clock I will tell you, step by step, how I came
to connect a stolen cheque with a 'ridiculous ghost.'"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We had a tussle&mdash;he showed fight at first," said Mr.
Clampe, when, precisely at ten o'clock the next morning, he called
upon Miss Brooke at the M?tropole. "If he had had time to get his
wits together and had called some of the men in that room to the
rescue, I verily believe we should have been roughly handled and he
might have slipped through our fingers after all. It's wonderful
what power these 'born orators,' as you call them, have over minds
of a certain order."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes," answered Loveday thoughtfully; "we talk glibly enough
about 'magnetic influence,' but scarcely realize how literally true
the phrase is. It is my firm opinion that the 'leaders of men,' as
they are called, have as absolute and genuine hypnotic power as any
modern French expert, although perhaps it may be less consciously
exercised. Now tell me about Rogers and Maria Lisle."</p>
<p>"Rogers had bolted, as you expected he would have done, with the
six hundred pounds he had been good enough to cash for his reverend
colleague. Ostensibly he had started for Judea to collect the
elect, as he phrased it, under one banner. In reality, he has
sailed for New York, where, thanks to the cable, he will be
arrested on his arrival and sent back by return packet. Maria Lisle
was arrested this morning on a charge of having stolen the cheque
from Mrs. Turner. By the way, Miss Brooke, I think it is almost a
pity you didn't take possession of her diary when you had the
chance. It would have been invaluable evidence against her and her
rascally colleagues."</p>
<p>"I did not see the slightest necessity for so doing. Remember,
she is not one of the criminal classes, but a religious enthusiast,
and when put upon her defence will at once confess and plead
religious conviction as an extenuating circumstance&mdash;at least,
if she is well advised she will do so. I never read anything that
laid bare more frankly than did this diary the mischief that the
sensational teaching of these millenarians is doing at the present
moment. But I must not take up your time with moralizing. I know
you are anxious to learn what, in the first instance, led me to
identify a millenarian preacher with a receiver of stolen
property."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's it; I want to know about the ghost; that's the
point that interests me."</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="265" height=
"391" src="1302211h-images/58.gif"><br>
"I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE GHOST."</p>
<p>"Very well. As I told you yesterday afternoon, the first thing
that struck me as remarkable in this ghost story was the soldierly
character of the ghost. One expects emotionally religious people
like Freer and his wife to see visions, but one also expects those
visions to partake of the nature of those emotions, and to be
somewhat shadowy and ecstatic. It seemed to me certain that this
Napoleonic ghost must have some sort of religious significance to
these people. This conviction it was that set my thoughts running
in the direction of the millenarians, who have attached a religious
significance (although not a polite one) to the name of Napoleon by
embodying the evil Apollyon in the person of a descendant of the
great Emperor, and endowing him with all the qualities of his
illustrious ancestor. I called upon the Freers, ordered a pair of
boots, and while the man was taking my measure, I asked him a few
very pointed questions on these millenarian notions. The man
prevaricated a good deal at first, but at length was driven to
admit that he and his wife were millenarians at heart, that, in
fact, the prayer meeting at which the Napoleonic ghost had made its
first appearance was a millenarian one, held by a man who had at
one time been a Wesleyan preacher in the chapel in Gordon Street,
but who had been dismissed from his charge there because his
teaching had been held to be unsound. Freer further stated that
this man had been so much liked that many members of the
congregation seized every opportunity that presented itself of
attending his ministrations, some openly, others, like himself and
his wife, secretly, lest they might give offence to the elders and
ministers of their chapel."</p>
<p>"And the bootmaking connection suffer proportionately," laughed
Mr. Clampe.</p>
<p>"Precisely. A visit to the Wesleyan chapel in Gordon Street and
a talk with the chapel attendant enabled me to complete the history
of this inhibited preacher, the Rev. Richard Steele. From this
attendant I ascertained that a certain elder of their chapel, John
Rogers by name, had seceded from their communion, thrown in his lot
with Richard Steele, and that the two together were now going about
the country preaching that the world would come to an end on
Thursday, April 11th, 1901, and that five years before this event,
viz., on the 5th of March, 1896 one hundred and forty-four thousand
living saints would be caught up to heaven. They furthermore
announced that this translation would take place in the land of
Judaea, that, shortly, saints from all parts of the world would be
hastening thither, and that in view of this event a society had
been formed to provide homes&mdash;a series, I suppose&mdash;for
the multitudes who would otherwise be homeless. Also (a very vital
point this), that subscriptions for this society would be gladly
received by either gentleman. I had arrived so far in my ghost
enquiry when you came to me, bringing the stolen cheque with its
pencilled figures, 144,000."</p>
<p>"Ah, I begin to see!" murmured Mr. Clampe.</p>
<p>"It immediately occurred to me that the man who could make
persons see an embodiment of his thought at will, would have very
little difficulty in influencing other equally receptive minds to a
breach of the ten commandments. The world, it seems to me, abounds
in people who are little more than blank sheets of paper, on which
a strong hand may transcribe what it will&mdash;hysteric subjects,
the doctors would call them; hypnotic subjects others would say;
really the line that divides the hysteric condition from the
hypnotic is a very hazy one. So now, when I saw your stolen cheque,
I said to myself, 'there is a sheet of blank paper somewhere in
that country vicarage, the thing is to find it out.'"</p>
<p>"Ah, good Mrs. Brown's gossip made your work easy to you
there."</p>
<p>"It did. She not only gave me a complete summary of the history
of the people within the vicarage walls, but she put so many
graphic touches to that history that they lived and moved before
me. For instance, she told me that Maria Lisle was in the habit of
speaking of Mrs. Turner as a 'Child of the Scarlet Woman,' a
'Daughter of Babylon,' and gave me various other minute
particulars, which enabled me, so to speak, to see Maria Lisle
going about her daily duties, rendering her mistress reluctant
service, hating her in her heart as a member of a corrupt faith,
and thinking she was doing God service by despoiling her of some of
her wealth, in order to devote it to what seemed to her a holy
cause. I would like here to read to you two entries which I copied
from her diary under dates respectively, August 3rd (the day the
cheque was lost), and August 7th (the following Sunday), when Maria
no doubt found opportunity to meet Steele at some prayer-meeting in
Brighton."</p>
<p>Here Loveday produced her note-book and read from it as
follows:</p>
<p>"'To-day I have spoiled the Egyptians! Taken from a Daughter of
Babylon that which would go to increase the power of the
Beast!'</p>
<p>"And again, under date August 7th, she writes:</p>
<p>"'I have handed to-day to my beloved pastor that of which I
despoiled at Daughter of Babylon. It was blank, but he told me he
would fill it in so that 144,000 of the elect would be each the
richer by one penny. Blessed thought! this is the doing of my most
unworthy hand.'</p>
<p>"A wonderful farrago, that diary of distorted Scriptural
phraseology&mdash;wild eulogies on the beloved pastor, and morbid
ecstatics, such as one would think could be the outcome only of a
diseased brain. It seems to me that Portland or Broadmoor, and the
ministrations of a sober-minded chaplain, may be about the happiest
thing that could befall Maria Lisle at this period of her career. I
think I ought to mention in this connection that when at the
religious service yesterday afternoon (to attend which I slightly
postponed my drive to East Downes), I heard Steele pronounce a
fervid eulogy on those who had strengthened his hands for the fight
which he knew it would shortly fall to his lot to wage against
Apollyon, I did not wonder at weak-minded persons like Maria Lisle,
swayed by such eloquence, setting up new standards of right and
wrong for themselves."</p>
<p>"Miss Brooke, another question or two. Can you in any way
account for the sudden payment of Mrs. Turner's debts&mdash;a
circumstance that led me a little astray in the first
instance?"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Brown explained the matter easily enough. She said that a
day or two back, when she was walking on the other side of the
vicarage hedge, and the husband and wife in the garden were
squabbling as usual over money-matters, she heard Mr. Turner say
indignantly, 'only a week or two ago I gave you nearly ?500 to pay
your debts in Brighton, and now there comes another bill.'"</p>
<p align="center" class="small"><img alt="" width="335" height=
"308" src="1302211h-images/59.gif"><br>
"SQUABBLING AS USUAL."</p>
<p>"Ah, that makes it plain enough. One more question and I have
done. I have no doubt there's something in your theory of the
hypnotic power (unconsciously exercised) of such men as Richard
Steele, although, at the same time, it seems to me a trifle
far-fetched and fanciful. But even admitting it, I don't see how
you account for the girl, Martha Watts, seeing the ghost. She was
not present at the prayer-meeting which called the ghost into
being, nor does she appear in any way to have come into contact
with the Rev. Richard Steele."</p>
<p>"Don't you think that ghost-seeing is quite as catching as
scarlet-fever or measles?" answered Loveday, with a little smile.
"Let one member of a family see a much individualized and easily
described ghost, such as the one these good people saw, and ten to
one others in the same house will see it before the week is over.
We are all in the habit of asserting that 'seeing is believing.'
Don't you think the converse of the saying is true also, and that
'believing is seeing?'</p>
<hr width="15%" align="center">
<h3 align="center"><a name="VII" id="VII"><i>MISSING!</i></a></h3>
<p>"N<small>OW</small>, Miss Brooke, if this doesn't inspire you I
don't know what will," said Mr. Dyer. And, taking up a handbill
that lay upon his writing-table, he read aloud as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Five hundred pounds reward.&mdash;Missing, since Monday,
September 20th, Iren?, only daughter of Richard Golding, of
Langford Hall, Langford Cross, Leicestershire. Age 18, height five
feet seven; dark hair and eyes, olive complexion, small features;
was dressed when she left home in dark blue serge walking costume,
with white straw sailor hat trimmed with cream ribbon. Jewellery
worn; plain gold brooch, leather strap bracelet holding small
watch, and on the third finger of left hand a marquise ring
consisting of one large diamond, surrounded with twelve rubies. Was
last seen about ten o'clock on the morning of the 20th leaving
Langford Hall Park for the high road leading to Langford Cross. The
above reward will be paid to any one giving such information as
will lead to the young lady's restoration to her home; or portions
of the reward, according to the value of the information received.
All communications to be addressed to the Chief Inspector, Police
Station, Langford Cross."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Was last seen on the 20th of September!" exclaimed Loveday, as
Mr. Dyer finished reading. "Why, that is ten days ago! Do you mean
to say that reward has not stimulated the energies of the local
police and long ago put them on the traces of the missing
girl?"</p>
<p>"It has stimulated their energies, not a doubt, for the local
papers teem with accounts of the way in which the whole country
about Langford has been turned upside down generally. Every river,
far and near has been dragged; every wood scoured; every railway
official at every station for miles round has been driven nearly
mad with persistent cross-questioning. But all to no purpose. The
affair remains as great a mystery as ever. The girl, as the
handbill says, was seen leaving the Park for the high road by some
children who chanced to be passing, but after that she seems to
have disappeared as completely as if the earth had opened to
receive her."</p>
<p>"Cannot her own people suggest any possible motive for her thus
suddenly leaving home?"</p>
<p>"It appears not; they seem absolutely incapable of assigning any
reason whatever for her extraordinary conduct. This morning I
received a letter from Inspector Ramsay, asking me to get you to
take up the case. Mr. Golding will not have the slightest objection
to your staying at the Hall and thoroughly investigating the
matter. Ramsay says it is just possible that they have concentrated
too much attention on the search outside the house, and that a
promising field for investigation may lie within."</p>
<p>"They should have thought of that before," said Loveday sharply.
"I hope you declined the case. Here's the country inspector to the
backbone! He'll keep a case in his own hands so long as there's a
chance of success; then, when it becomes practically hopeless, hand
it over to you just to keep his own failure in countenance by
yours."</p>
<p>"Ye-es," said Mr. Dyer, slowly. "I suppose that's about it. But
still, business has been slack of late&mdash;expenses are
heavy&mdash;if you thought there was a ghost of a
chance&mdash;"</p>
<p>"After ten days!" interrupted Miss Brooke, "when the house has
settled down into routine, and every one has his story cut and
dried, and all sorts of small details have been falsified or
smudged over! Criminal cases are like fevers; they should be taken
in hand within twenty-four hours."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know," said Mr. Dyer irritably, "but still, as I said
before, business is slack&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, well, if I'm to go, I'm to go, and there's an end of it,"
said Loveday resignedly. "I only say it would have been better, for
the credit of the office, if you had declined such a hopeless
affair. Tell me a little about this Mr. Richard Golding, who and
what he is."</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer's temper grew serene again.</p>
<p>"He is a very wealthy man," he answered, "an Australian
merchant; came over to England about a dozen years ago, and settled
down at Langford Hall. He had, however, been living in Italy for
some six or seven years previously. On his way home from Australia
he did Italy, as so many Australians do, fell in love with a pretty
girl, whom he met at Naples, and married her, and by her had this
one child, Iren?, who is causing such a sensation at the present
moment."</p>
<p>"Is this Italian wife living?"</p>
<p>"No, she died just before Mr. Golding came to England. He has
not yet married again, but I hear is on the point of so doing. The
lady he contemplates making the second Mrs. Golding is a certain
Mrs. Greenhow, a widow, who for the past year or so has acted as
chaperon to his daughter and housekeeper to himself."</p>
<p>"It is possible that Miss Iren? was not too well pleased at the
idea of having a stepmother."</p>
<p>"Such is the fact. From all accounts she and her future
stepmother did not get on at all well together. Miss Iren? has a
very hasty, imperious temper, and Mrs. Greenhow seems to have been
quite incapable of holding her own with her. She was to have left
the hall this month to make her preparations for the approaching
wedding; the young lady's disappearance, however, has naturally
brought matters to a standstill."</p>
<p>"Did Miss Golding take any money away with her, do you
know?"</p>
<p>"Ah, nobody seems sure on that head. Mr. Golding gave her a
liberal allowance and exacted no accounts. Sometimes she had her
purse full at the end of the quarter, sometimes it was empty before
her quarterly cheque had been cashed a week. I fear you will have
to do without exact information on that most important point.</p>
<p>"She had lovers, of course?"</p>
<p>"Yes; in spite of her quick temper she seems to have been a
lovable and most attractive young woman, with her half-Australian
half-Italian parentage, and to have turned the heads of all the men
in the neighbourhood. Only two, however, appear to have found the
slightest favour in her eyes&mdash;a certain Lord Guilleroy, who
owns nearly all the land for miles round Langford, and a young
fellow called Gordon Cleeve, the only son of Sir Gordon Cleeve, a
wealthy baronet. The girl seems to have coquetted pretty equally
with these two; then suddenly, for some reason or other, she gives
Mr. Cleeve to understand that his attentions are distasteful to
her, and gives unequivocal encouragement to Lord Guilleroy. Gordon
Cleeve does not sit down quietly under this treatment. He threatens
to shoot first his rival, then himself, then Miss Golding; finally,
does none of these three things, but starts off on a three years'
journey round the world."</p>
<p>"Threatens to shoot her; starts off on a journey round the
world," summed up Loveday. "Do you know the date of the day on
which he left Langford?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it was on the 19th; the day before Miss Golding
disappeared. But Ramsay has already traced him down to Brindisi;
ascertained that he went on board the <i>Buckingham, en route</i>
for Alexandria, and has beaten out the theory that he can, by any
possibility, be connected with the affair. So I wouldn't advise you
to look in that quarter for your clue."</p>
<p>"I am not at all sanguine about finding a clue in any quarter,"
said Loveday, as she rose to take leave.</p>
<p>She did not feel in the best of tempers, and was a little
disposed to resent having a case, so to speak, forced upon her
under such disadvantageous conditions.</p>
<p>Her last words to Mr. Dyer were almost the first she addressed
to Inspector Ramsay when, towards the close of the day, she was met
by him at Langford Cross Station. Ramsay was a lanky, bony
Scotchman, sandy-haired and slow of speech.</p>
<p>"Our hopes centre on you; we trust you'll not disappoint us," he
said, by way of a greeting.</p>
<p>His use of the plural number made Loveday turn in the direction
of a tall, good-looking man, with a remarkably frank expression of
countenance, who stood at the inspector's elbow.</p>
<p>"I am Lord Guilleroy," said this gentleman, coming forward.
"Will you allow me to drive you to Langford Hall? My cab is waiting
outside."</p>
<p>"Thank you; one moment," answered Loveday, again turning to
Ramsay. "Now, do you wish," she said, addressing him, "to tell me
anything beyond the facts you have already communicated to Mr.
Dyer?"</p>
<p>"No-o," answered the inspector, slowly and sententiously. "I
would rather not bias your mind in any direction by any theory of
mine." ("It would be rather a waste of time to attempt such a
thing," thought Loveday.) "The only additional fact I have to
mention is one you would see for yourself so soon as you arrived at
the Hall, namely, that Mr. Golding is keeping up with great
difficulty&mdash;in fact, is on the verge of a break-down. He has
not had half an hour's sleep since his daughter left home,&mdash;a
serious thing that for a man at his age."</p>
<p>Loveday was favourably impressed with Lord Guilleroy. He gave
her the idea of being a man of strong common-sense and great
energy. His conversation was marked by a certain reserve. Although,
however, he evidently declined to wear his heart upon his sleeve,
it was easy to see, from a few words that escaped him, that if the
search for Miss Golding proved fruitless his whole life would be
wrecked.</p>
<p>He did not share Inspector Ramsay's wish not to bias Loveday's
mind by any theory of his own.</p>
<p>"If I had a theory you should have it in a minute," he said, as
he whipped up his horse and drove rapidly along the country road;
"but I confess at the present moment my mind is a perfect blank on
the matter. I have had a dozen theories, and have been compelled,
one by one, to let them all go. I have suspected every one in turn,
Cleeve, her own father (God forgive me!), her intended step-mother,
the very servants in the house, and, one by one, circumstances have
seemed to exonerate them all. It's bewildering&mdash;it's
maddening! And most maddening of all it is to have to sit here with
idle hands, when I would scour the earth from end to end to find
her!"</p>
<p>The country around Langford Hall, like most of the hunting
districts in Leicestershire, was as flat as if a gigantic
stream-roller had passed over it. The Hall itself was a somewhat
imposing Gothic structure, of rough grey stone. Very grey and drear
it showed in the autumn landscape as Loveday drove in through the
park gates and caught her first glimpse of it between the all but
leafless elms that flanked the drive. The equinoctial gales had set
in early this year, and heavy rains had helped forward their work
of wreckage and destruction. The green sward of the park was near
akin to a swamp; and the trout stream that flowed across it at an
angle showed swollen to its very banks. The sky was leaden with
gathering masses of clouds; a flight of rooks, wheeling low and
flapping their black wings, with their mournful cawing, completed
the dreariness of the scene.</p>
<p>"A companion picture, this," Loveday thought, "to the desolation
that must reign within the house with the fate of its only daughter
unknown&mdash;unguessed at even."</p>
<p>As she alighted at the hall door, a magnificent Newfoundland dog
came bounding forth. Lord Guilleroy caressed it heartily.</p>
<p>"It was her dog," he explained. "We have tried in vain to make
him track down his mistress&mdash;these dogs haven't the scent of
hounds."</p>
<p>He excused himself from entering the house with Loveday.</p>
<p>"It's like a vault&mdash;a catacomb; I can't stand it," he said.
"No, I'll take back my horse;" this was said to the man who stood
waiting. "Tell Mr. Golding he'll see me round in the morning
without fail."</p>
<p>Loveday was shown into the library, where Mr. Golding was
waiting to receive her. In the circumstances no disguise as to her
name and profession had been deemed necessary, and she was
announced simply as Miss Brooke from Lynch Court.</p>
<p>Mr. Golding greeted her warmly. One glance at him convinced her
that Inspector Ramsay had given no exaggerated account of the
bereaved father. His face was wan and haggard; his head was bowed;
his voice sounded strained and weak. He seemed incapable of
speaking on any save the one topic that filled his thoughts.</p>
<p>"We pin our faith on you, Miss Brooke," he said; "you are our
last hope. Now, tell me you do not despair of being able to end
this awful suspense one way or another. A day or two more of it
will put me into my coffin!"</p>
<p>"Miss Brooke will perhaps like to have some tea, and to rest a
little, after her long journey before she begins to talk?" said a
lady, at that moment entering the room and advancing towards her.
Loveday could only conjecture that this was Mrs. Greenhow, for Mr.
Golding was too preoccupied to make any attempt to an
introduction.</p>
<p>Mrs. Greenhow was a small, slight woman, with fluffy hair and
green-grey eyes. Her voice suggested a purr; her eyes, a
scratch.</p>
<p>"Cat-tribe!" thought Loveday; "the velvet paw and the hidden
claw&mdash;the exact antithesis, I should say, to one of Miss
Golding's temperament."</p>
<p>Mr. Golding went back to the one subject he had at heart.</p>
<p>"You have had my daughter's photograph given to you, I've no
doubt," he said; "but this I consider a far better likeness." Here
he pointed to a portrait in pastels that hung above his
writing-table. It was that of a large-eyed, handsome girl of
eighteen, with a remarkably sweet expression about the mouth.</p>
<p>Mrs. Greenhow again interposed. "I think, if you don't mind my
saying so," she said, "you would slightly mislead Miss Brooke if
you led her to think that that was a perfect likeness of dear Ren?.
Much as I love the dear girl," here she turned to Loveday, "I'm
bound to admit that one seldom or never saw her wearing such a
sweet expression of countenance."</p>
<p>Mr. Golding frowned, and sharply changed the subject.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Miss Brooke," he said, "what was your first impression
when the facts of the case were submitted to you? I have been told
that first impressions with you are generally infallible."</p>
<p>Loveday parried the question.</p>
<p>"I am not at present sure that I am in possession of all the
facts," she answered. "There are one or two questions I
particularly want to ask&mdash;you must forgive me if they seem to
you a little irrelevant to the matter in hand. First and foremost,
I want to know if any formal good-bye took place between your
daughter and Mr. Gordon Cleeve?"</p>
<p>"I think not. A sudden coolness arose between them, and the
young fellow went away without so much as shaking hands with
me."</p>
<p>"I fear an irreparable breach has occurred between the Cleeves
and yourself on account of dear Ren?'s extraordinary treatment of
Gordon," said Mrs. Greenhow sweetly.</p>
<p>"There was no extraordinary treatment," said Mr. Golding, now
almost in anger. "My daughter and Mr. Cleeve were good
friends&mdash;nothing more, I assure you&mdash;until one day Ren?
saw him cruelly thrashing one of his setters, and after that she
cut him dead&mdash;would have nothing whatever to do with him."</p>
<p>"Maddalena told Inspector Ramsay," said Mrs. Greenhow, sweetly
still, "that on the evening before Gordon Cleeve left Langford dear
Ren? received a note from him&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Which she tossed unopened into the fire," finished Mr.
Golding.</p>
<p>"Who is Maddalena?" interrupted Loveday.</p>
<p>"My daughter's maid. I brought her over from Naples twelve years
ago as nurse, and as Ren? grew older she naturally enough fell into
her duties as Ren?'s maid. She is a dear, faithful creature; her
aunt was nurse to Ren?'s mother."</p>
<p>"Is it possible for Maddalena to be told off to wait upon me
while I am in the house?" asked Loveday, turning to Mrs.
Greenhow.</p>
<p>"Certainly, if you wish it. At the same time, I warn you that
she is not in a particularly amiable frame of mind just now, and
will be very likely to be sullen and disobliging," answered the
lady.</p>
<p>"Maddalena is not generally either one or the other," said Mr.
Golding deprecatingly; "but just now she is a little unlike
herself. The truth is, all the servants have been a little too
rigorously cross-examined by the police on matters of which they
could have absolutely no knowledge, and Ramsay made such a dead set
at Lena that the girl felt herself insulted, grew sullen, and
refused to open her lips."</p>
<p>"She must be handled judiciously. I suppose she was
broken-hearted when Miss Golding did not return from her morning's
walk?"</p>
<p>A reply was prevented by the entrance of a servant with a
telegram in his hand.</p>
<p>Mr. Golding tore it open, and, in a trembling voice, read aloud
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Some one answering to the description of your daughter was seen
yesterday in the Champs Elys?es, but disappeared before she could
be detained. Watch arrivals at Folkestone and Dover."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The telegram was dated from Paris, and was from M. Dulau, of the
Paris police. Mr. Golding's agitation was pitiable.</p>
<p>"Great heavens! is it possible?" he cried, putting his hand to
his forehead as if stunned. "I'll start for Dover&mdash;no, Paris,
I think, at once." He staggered to his feet, looking around him in
a dazed and bewildered fashion. He might as well have talked of
starting for the moon or the north star.</p>
<p>"Pardon me," said Loveday, "Inspector Ramsay is the right person
to deal with that telegram. It should be sent to him at once."</p>
<p>Mr. Golding sank back in his chair, trembling from head to
foot.</p>
<p>"I think you are right," he said faintly. "I might break down
and lose a possible chance."</p>
<p>Then he turned once more to the man, who stood waiting for
orders, and desired him to take the fastest horse to the stables
and ride at once with the telegram to the Inspector.</p>
<p>"And," he added, "on your way back call at the Castle, see Lord
Guilleroy, and give him the news." He turned a pleading face
towards Loveday. "This is good news&mdash;you consider it good
news, do you not?" he asked piteously.</p>
<p>"It won't do to depend too much on it, will it?" said Mrs.
Greenhow. "You see, there have been so many false alarms&mdash;if I
may use the word."&mdash;This was said to Loveday.&mdash;"Three
times last week we had telegrams from different parts of the
country saying dear Ren? had been seen&mdash;now here, now there, I
think there must be a good many girls like her wandering about the
world."</p>
<p>"The dress has something to do with it, no doubt," answered
Loveday; "it is not a very distinctive one. Still, we must hope for
the best. It is possible, of course, that at this very moment the
young lady may be on her way home with a full explanation of what
has seemed extraordinary conduct on her part. Now, if you will
allow me, I will go to my room. And will you please give the order
that Maddalena shall follow me there as quickly as possible?"</p>
<p>Loveday's thoughts were very busy when, in the quietude of her
own room, she sank into an easy chair beside the fire. The case to
which she had so unwillingly devoted her attention was beginning to
present some interesting intricacies. She passed in view the
<i>dramatis personae</i> of the little drama which she could only
hope might not end in a tragedy. The broken-hearted father; the
would-be-step-mother, with her feline affinities; the faithful
maid; the cruel-tempered lover; the open-faced, energetic one; each
in turn received their meed of attention.</p>
<p>"That man would be one to depend on in an emergency," she said
to herself, allowing her thoughts to dwell a little longer upon
Lord Guilleroy than upon the others. "He has, I should say, a good
head on his shoulders and&mdash;"</p>
<p>But here a tap-tap at the door brought her thinking to a
standstill, and in response to her "come in" the door opened and
the maid Lena entered.</p>
<p>She was a tall, black-eyed, dark-skinned woman of about thirty,
dressed in a neat black stuff gown. Twelve years of English
domestic life had considerably modified the outer tokens of her
nationality; a gold dagger that kept a thick coil of hair in its
place, and a massive Roman-cut cameo ring on the third finger of
her right hand, were about the only things that differentiated her
appearance from that of the ordinary English lady's maid. Possibly
as a rule she wore a pleasant, smiling expression of countenance.
For the moment, however, her face was shadowed by a sullen scowl,
that said plainly as words could: "I am here very much against my
will, and intend to render you the most unwilling of services."</p>
<p>Loveday felt that she must be taken in hand at once.</p>
<p>"You are Miss Golding's maid, I believe?" she said in a short,
sharp tone.</p>
<p>"Yes, madame." This in a slow, sullen one.</p>
<p>"Very well, Kindly unstrap that portmanteau and open my
dressing-bag. I am glad you are to wait upon me while I am here. I
don't suppose you ever before in your life acted maid to a lady
detective?"</p>
<p>"Never, madame." This in a still more sullen tone than
before.</p>
<p>"Ah, it will be a new experience to you, and I hope that it may
be made a profitable one also. Tell me, are you saving up money to
get married?"</p>
<p>Lena, on her knees unstrapping the portmanteau, started and
looked up.</p>
<p>"How does madame know that?" she asked, Loveday pointed to the
cameo ring on her third finger. "I only guessed at such a
possibility," she answered. "Well, now, Lena, I am going to make
you an offer. I will give you fifty pounds&mdash;fifty, remember,
in English gold&mdash;if you will procure for me certain
information that I require in the prosecution of my work here."</p>
<p>The sullen look on Lena's face deepened.</p>
<p>"I am a servant of the house," she answered, bending lower over
the portmanteau; "I do not sell its secrets even for English
gold."</p>
<p>"But it is not the secrets of your master's house I am wanting
to buy&mdash;no, nor anybody else's secrets; I only want you to
procure for me certain information that I could easily have
procured for myself if I had been a little sooner on the scene. And
the information I want relates to no one inside the house, but some
one outside of it&mdash;Mr. Gordon Cleeve."</p>
<p>The sullen look on Lena's face gave place to one of intense,
unutterable relief.</p>
<p>"Mr. Gordon Cleeve!" she repeated. "Oh-h, for fifty pounds, I
will undertake to bring madame a good deal of information about
him; I know some of the servants in Sir Gordon's house. I know,
too, the mother of Mr. Cleeve's valet who has started with him on
his journey round the world."</p>
<p>"Good. So, then, it is a bargain. Now, Lena, tell me truly, is
this Mr. Cleeve a great favourite with you?"</p>
<p>"With me! Ah, the good God forbid, madame! I never liked him; I
used to say to Miss Ren? when I brought her his flowers and his
notes: 'Have nothing to do with him, he is cruel&mdash;bad at
heart.'"</p>
<p>"Ah, yes; I read all that in your face when I mentioned his
name. Now what I want you first and foremost to do for me is to
find out how this young man spent the last day that he was at
Langford. I want you to bring me a report of his doings&mdash;as
exact a report as possible&mdash;on the 18th of this month."</p>
<p>"I will do my best, madame."</p>
<p>"Very good. Now, there is something else. Would you be greatly
surprised if I told you that the young man did not sail in the
<i>Buckingham</i> from Brindisi as is generally supposed?"</p>
<p>"Madame! Inspector Ramsay said he had ascertained beyond a doubt
that Mr. Cleeve went on board the <i>Buckingham</i> at
Brindisi!"</p>
<p>"Ah, to go on board is one thing; to sail is another! Now,
listen, Lena, very carefully to what I am going to say. I am
expecting daily to receive some most important information
respecting this gentleman's movements, and I may want some one to
set off at a minute's notice for Paris, perhaps; or, perhaps,
Florence or Naples, to verify that information: would you do this
for me?&mdash;of course, I would supply you with money and full
details as to your journey."</p>
<p>A flush of pleasure passed over Lena's face.</p>
<p>"Yes, madame," she answered; "if you could get my master's
permission for me to go."</p>
<p>"I will undertake to do so." She pondered a moment, then added a
little tentatively, and closely watching Lena's face as she asked
the question, "I suppose Miss Golding resembled her mother in
appearance&mdash;I do not see any likeness between her portrait and
her father."</p>
<p>Lena's sullenness and stateliness had vanished together now, and
once upon the topic of her nursling she was the warm-hearted,
enthusiastic Italian woman once more. She became voluble in her
description of her dear Miss Ren?, her beauty, her fascinating
ways, which she traced entirely to the Italian blood that flowed in
her veins; and anecdote after anecdote she related of the happy
time when they lived among the lakes and mountains of her native
land.</p>
<p>The room grew dark and darker, while she gossiped apace, and
presently the dressing-bell clanged through the house.</p>
<p>"Light the candles now," said Loveday, rising from her seat
beside the fire; "draw down the blinds and shut out that dreary
autumn scene, it sets me shivering!"</p>
<p>It might well do so. The black clouds had fulfilled their
threat, and rain was now dashing in torrents against the panes. A
tall sycamore, immediately outside the window, creaked and groaned
dismally in response to the wind that came whistling round the
corner of the house, and between the swaying and all but leafless
elms Loveday could catch a glimpse of the grey, winding trout
stream, swollen now to its limits and threatening to overflow its
banks.</p>
<p>Dinner that night was in keeping with the gloom that overhung
the house within and without; although the telegram from Paris had
seemed to let in a ray of hope, Mr. Golding was evidently afraid to
put much trust in it.</p>
<p>"As Mrs. Greenhow says, 'we have had so many disappointments,'"
he said sadly, as he took his place at table. "So many false
clues&mdash;false scents started. Ramsay has at once put himself in
communication with the police at Boulogne and Calais, as well as at
Dover and Folkestone. We can only pray that something may come of
it!"</p>
<p>"And dear Lord Guilleroy," chimed in Mrs. Greenhow, in her soft,
purring voice, "has started for Paris immediately. The young man
has such a vast amount of energy, and thinks he can do the work of
the police better than they can do it for themselves."</p>
<p>"That's hardly a fair way of putting it, Clare," interrupted Mr.
Golding irritably; "he is working heart and soul with the police,
and thinks it advisable that some one representing me should be in
Paris, in case an emergency should arise; also he wants himself to
question Dulau respecting my daughter's sudden appearance and
disappearance in the Paris streets. Guilleroy," here he turned to
Loveday, "is devotedly attached to my daughter, and&mdash;why,
Dryad, what's the matter, old man? down, down! Don't growl and
whine in that miserable fashion."</p>
<p>He had broken off to address these words to the Newfoundland,
who, until that moment, had been comfortably stretched on the
hearth-rug before the fire, but who now had suddenly started to his
feet with ears erect, and given a prolonged growl, that ended in
something akin to a whine.</p>
<p>"It may be a fox trotting past the window," said Mrs. Greenhow,
whipping at the dog with her lace handkerchief. But Dryad was not
to be so easily subdued. With his nose to the ground now he was
sniffing uneasily at and around the heavy curtains that half draped
the long French windows of the room.</p>
<p>"Something has evidently disturbed him. Why not let him out into
the garden?" said Loveday. And Mr. Golding, with a "Hey, Dryad, go
find!" unfastened the window and let the dog out into the windy
darkness.</p>
<p>Dinner was a short meal that night. It was easy to see that it
was only by a strong effort of will that Mr. Golding kept his place
at table, and made even a pretence of eating.</p>
<p>At the close of the meal Loveday asked for a quiet corner, in
which to write some business letters, and was shown into the
library by Mr. Golding.</p>
<p>"You'll find all you require here, I think," he said, with
something of a sigh, as he placed a chair for her at a lady's
davenport. "This was Ren?'s favourite corner, and here are the last
flowers she gathered&mdash;dead, all dead, but I will not have them
touched!" He broke off abruptly, set down the vase of dead asters
which he had taken in his hand, and quitted the room, leaving
Loveday to the use of Ren?'s pen, ink, paper, and blotting-pad.</p>
<p>Loveday soon became absorbed in her business letters. Time flew
swiftly, and it was not until a clock on the mantelpiece chimed the
hour&mdash;ten o'clock&mdash;that she gave a thought as to what
might be the hour for retiring at the Hall.</p>
<p>Something else beside the striking of the clock almost
simultaneously caught her ear&mdash;the whining and scratching of a
dog at one of the windows. These, like those of the dining-room,
opened as doors into an outside verandah. They were, however,
closely shuttered, and Loveday had to ring for a servant to undo
the patent fastener.</p>
<p>So soon as the window was opened Dryad rushed into the room,
plastered with mud, and dripping with water from every hair.</p>
<p>"He must have been in the stream," said the footman, trying to
collar the dog and lead him out of the room.</p>
<p>"Stop! one moment!" cried Loveday, for her eye had caught sight
of something hanging in shreds between the dog's teeth. She bent
over him, patting and soothing him, and contrived to disentangle
those shreds, which a closer examination proved to be a few
tattered fragments of dark blue serge.</p>
<p>"Is your letter-writing nearly ended, Miss Brooke?" asked Mr.
Golding, at that moment entering the room.</p>
<p>For reply, Loveday held up the shreds of blue serge. His face
grew ashen white; he needed no explanation; those shreds and the
dripping dog seemed to tell their own tale.</p>
<p>"Great heavens!" he cried, "why did I not follow the dog out!
There must be a search at once. Get men, lanterns, ropes, a
ladder&mdash;the dog, too, will be of use."</p>
<p>A terrible energy took possession of him. "Find, Dryad, find!"
he shouted to the dog, and then, hatless and thin-shoed as he was,
he rushed out into the darkness with Dryad at his heels.</p>
<p>In less than five minutes afterwards the whole of the
men-servants of the house, with lanterns, ropes, and a ladder long
enough to span the stream, had followed him. The wind had fallen,
the rain had ceased now, and a watery half-moon was struggling
through the thin, flying clouds. Loveday and Mrs. Greenhow,
standing beneath the verandah, watched the men disappear in the
direction of the trout stream, whither Dryad had led the way. From
time to time shouts came to them, through the night stillness, of
"This way!" "No, here!" together with Dryad's sharp bark and the
occasional distant flash of a bull's-eye lantern. It was not until
nearly half an hour afterwards that one of the men came running
back to the house with a solemn white face and a pitiful tale. He
wanted something that would serve for a stretcher, he said in a
subdued tone&mdash;the two-fold oak screen in the hall would
do&mdash;and please, into which room was "it" to be
brought?&mdash;</p>
<p>On the following evening Mr. Dyer received a lengthy dispatch
from Miss Brooke, which ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">"L<small>ANGFORD</small> H<small>ALL.</small></p>
<p>"This is to supplement my telegram of an hour back, telling you
of the finding of Miss Golding's body in the stream that runs
through her father's grounds. Mr. Golding has himself identified
the body, and has now utterly collapsed. At the present moment it
seems rather doubtful whether he will be in a fit state to give
evidence at the inquest, which will be held to-morrow. Miss Golding
appears to be dressed as she was when she left home, with this
notable exception&mdash;the marquise ring has disappeared from the
third finger of her left hand, and in its stead she wears a plain
gold wedding-ring. Now this is a remarkable circumstance, and
strikes a strange keynote to my mind. I am writing hurriedly, and
can only give you the most important points in this very singular
case. The maid, Lena, a reserved, self-contained woman, gave way to
a passion of grief when the young lady's body was brought in and
laid upon her own bed. She insisted on performing all the last sad
offices for the dead, however, in spite of her grief, and is now, I
am glad to say, calmer and capable of a little quiet conversation
with me. I keep her continually in attendance on me, as I am rather
anxious to keep my eye on her just now. I have telegraphed to Lord
Guilleroy, asking him, in spite of the terrible news which will in
due course reach him, to be good enough to remain in Paris awaiting
directions from me, which may have to be carried out at a minute's
notice. I hope to have further news to send a little later on."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Dyer laid aside the letter with a grunt of
dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>"Well," he said to himself, "I suppose she expects me to be able
to read between the lines, but I'm bothered if I can make head or
tail of it all. She seems to me to be going a little wide of the
mark just now; it might be as well to give her a hint." So he
dashed off a few brief lines as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I suppose you are concentrating now on finding out what were
Miss Golding's movements while absent from her home. It seems to me
this could be better done in Paris than at Langford Hall. The ring
on her finger necessarily implies that she has gone through a
marriage service somewhere, and as she was seen in Paris a day or
two ago, it is as likely as not that the ceremony took place there.
The Paris police could give you 'yea or nay' on this matter within
twenty-four hours. As to the maid, Lena, I think you are laying too
much stress upon her possible knowledge of her mistress's
movements.</p>
<p>"If she had been tied down to secrecy by promise of reward, she
would naturally, now that all such promises are rendered futile,
reveal all she knows on the matter&mdash;she has nothing to gain by
keeping the secrets of the dead."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter crossed on its road a telegram from Loveday running
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Inquest over. Verdict, 'Found drowned, but how deceased got
into the water there is no evidence to show.' Funeral takes place
to-morrow; Mr. Golding delirious with brain fever."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the day following Mr. Dyer received a second letter from
Loveday. Thus it ran:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The funeral is over; Mr. Golding is much worse, I have
dispatched Lena to Paris, telling her I require her services there
to follow up a clue I hold respecting Mr. Gordon Cleeve, and
promising her rewards commensurate with the manner in which she
carries out my orders. I have also written to Lord Guilleroy,
telling him the sort of assistance I require from him. If he is the
man I take him for he will be more useful to me than all the Paris
police put together. I will answer your letter in detail in a day
or two. The neighbourhood is still in a state of great excitement,
and all sorts of wild reports are flying about. Ramsay and Dulau
have traced a lady, dressed in dark blue serge, and answering in
other respects to Miss Golding's description, from the Gare du
Midi, Paris, step by step to her arrival at Langford Cross, whence,
poor thing, she must have walked through the pouring rain to the
Hall. I do not see, however, that this information helps us forward
one step towards the solution of the mystery of the girl's
disappearance. Ramsay is a little inclined to criticize what he
calls my 'leisurely handling' of the case. Mrs. Greenhow, who is a
terribly empty-headed, but at the same time essentially
hard-natured little woman, appears disposed to follow suit, and has
more than once thrown out hints that my stay in the house is being
unnecessarily prolonged. As there is practically no further
necessity for my remaining at the Hall, I have told her that I
shall to-day take up my quarters at the Roebuck Inn (by courtesy
hotel), at Langford Cross. I believe she is unfeignedly glad at
what she considers the ending of the affair. The imperious yet
fascinating young lady no doubt ruled her and the household
generally with a rod of iron, and the little woman, I feel sure, if
she had dared, would have ordered bonfires and a general rejoicing
on the day of the funeral. Well, I have not much sympathy with her,
and am preparing for her a shock to her not too-sensitive nerves
which she little suspects. My chief anxiety at the present moment
is Mr. Golding, who still remains unconscious. I have requested the
doctors to send me two bulletins daily of his condition, which I
fear is a most serious one."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There could be little doubt on this head. The doctors' verdict
on the day that Loveday left Langford Hall for "The Roebuck" was:
"Absolutely no hope." The bulletin brought to her on the following
morning was "Condition remains unchanged." On the third day,
however, the report was "Slight improvement." Then followed the
welcome bulletins of "Improvement maintained," and "Out of danger,"
to be followed by the most welcome report of all: "Is making steady
progress towards recovery."</p>
<p>"It is Mr. Golding's illness that has kept me here so long,"
said Loveday to Inspector Ramsay, as if by way of apology for her
continued presence on the scene. "I think, however, I can see my
way to departure now. Going to Paris? Oh, dear me, no. I have
telegraphed to Mr. Dyer to expect me back the day after to-morrow;
if you will like to come to me here, or will meet me at Langford
Cross Station, I will give you a full report of all I have done
since I took the case in hand. Now I am going to the Hall to
ascertain at what hour to-morrow it will be convenient for me to
say good-bye to Mr. Golding."</p>
<p>More than this Ramsay was unable to extract from Miss Brooke.
His open strictures upon what he called her "leisurely handling of
the case" had put her upon her mettle, and she had decided that
Ramsay and his colleagues should be taught that Lynch Court had a
special way of doing things, and could hold its own with the
best.</p>
<p>On her way to the Hall Loveday called at the post-office, and
there had a letter with a London postmark handed to her. This she
at once opened and read, and then dispatched a reply to it by
telegram. The reply was an enigmatic one to the village
post-master, for Loveday, after a few casual questions as to his
knowledge of Continental languages, chose German as her medium of
communication. The address, however, "to Lord Guilleroy, at Charing
Cross Hotel," was plain reading enough.</p>
<p>At the Hall Loveday found Mrs. Greenhow in an active state of
mind. Mr. Golding, she informed her with a sweet effusiveness,
would come downstairs for a short time on the following day, and
she was doing all that lay in her power to put out of sight
anything that might awaken painful recollections. "I have had dear
Ren?'s harp removed to a lumber room, her portrait taken down from
the library wall," she said, in her usual purring tones; "and her
davenport is being wheeled into my own sitting-room. Poor dear
Ren?! If only she could have been taught to govern her willful
temper a happier fate might have befallen her. What that fate was I
suppose we shall never know now."</p>
<p>Loveday's only reply to this was to ask for an exact report of
the doctor's opinion of Mr. Golding's condition. Mrs. Greenhow put
her handkerchief to her eyes as she answered that Doctor Godwin's
opinion was that, so far as bodily strength was concerned, he was
considerably better, but that his mental condition was a serious
one. His brain appeared to be in a state of semi-stupefaction,
which it was possible might be indicative of the softening of its
tissues.</p>
<p>Loveday expressed a wish to see this doctor&mdash;to time her
farewell visit to Mr. Golding on the following day with Dr.
Godwin's daily call. In fact, she would like a little private talk
with him before she went in to see his patient.</p>
<p>To all this Mrs. Greenhow offered no objection. Lady detectives,
she said to herself, were a race apart, and had a curious way of
doing things; but, thank Heaven, she would soon see the last of
this one!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stormy autumnal weather had given place now to a brief spell
of late summer sunshine, and on the last day of her visit to
Langford, Miss Brooke had a cheerier view of the Hall and its
surroundings than she had had on the day of her arrival there. The
trout stream had retreated to its natural proportions, and showed
like a streak of molten silver&mdash;not a grey, turbid
flood&mdash;in the bright sunlight that played at hide-and-seek
between the branches of the stript elms. Even the old rooks seemed
to have a cheery undernote to their "caw, caw" as they wheeled
about the old house; and Dryad himself, as he once more came
bounding forth to greet her, appeared to her fancy to have a less
dolorous ring in his noisy bark.</p>
<p>"That dog is a perfect nuisance&mdash;has been utterly spoilt. I
must have him chained up," said Mrs. Greenhow, as she led the way
into a room where Dr. Godwin sat awaiting Loveday. She introduced
them one to the other. "Shall I remain, or do you wish to converse
alone?" she asked.</p>
<p>And as Loveday answered with decision "Alone," the little woman
had no choice but to withdraw, wondering once more over the
vagaries of lady detectives.</p>
<p>Half an hour afterwards the doctor, a clever-looking, active
little man, led the way into the library where Mr. Golding was
seated.</p>
<p>Loveday was greatly shocked at the change which a few days'
illness had wrought in him. His chair was drawn close to the
window, and the autumn sunshine that filled the room threw into
pitiful relief his shrunken frame and pallid face, aged now by
about a dozen years. His eyes were closed, his head was bent low on
his breast, and he did not lift it as the door opened.</p>
<p>"You need not remain," said Dr. Godwin to the nurse, who rose as
they entered; and Loveday and the doctor were left alone with the
patient.</p>
<p>Loveday drew near softly. "I am going back to town this evening,
and have come to say good-bye," she said, extending her hand.</p>
<p>Mr. Golding opened his eyes, staring vaguely at the extended
hand. "To say good-bye!" he repeated, in a dreamy, far-away
tone.</p>
<p>"I am Miss Brooke," Loveday explained. "I came down from London
to investigate the strange circumstances connected with your
daughter's disappearance."</p>
<p>"My daughter's disappearance!" He started and began to tremble
violently.</p>
<p>The doctor had his hand on his patient's pulse now.</p>
<p>"I have conducted my investigations under somewhat
disadvantageous circumstances," Loveday went on quietly, "and, for
a time, with but little result. A few days back, however, I
received important information from Lord Guilleroy, and to-day I
have seen and communicated with him. In fact, it was his carriage
that brought me to your house this afternoon."</p>
<p>"Lord Guilleroy!" repeated Mr. Golding slowly. His voice had a
more natural ring in it; recollection, although, perhaps, a painful
one, seemed to sound in it.</p>
<p>"Yes. He said he would wander about the park until I had seen
and prepared you for his visit. Ah! there he is coming up the
drive."</p>
<p>Here she drew back the curtain that half draped the open
window.</p>
<p>This window commanded a good view of the drive, with its
overarching elms, that led from the lodge gates to the house. Along
that drive two persons were advancing at that moment in leisurely
fashion; one of those two was undoubtedly Lord Guilleroy, the other
was a tall, graceful girl, dressed in deep mourning.</p>
<p>Mr. Golding's eyes followed Loveday's at first with a blank,
expressionless stare. Then, little by little, that stare changed
into a look of intelligence and recognition. His face grew ashen
white, then a wave of colour swept over it.</p>
<p>"Lord Guilleroy, yes," he said, panting and struggling for
breath. "But&mdash;but who is that walking with him? Tell me, tell
me quickly, for the love of Heaven!"</p>
<p>He tried to rise to his feet, but his limbs failed him. The
doctor poured out a cordial, and put it to his lips.</p>
<p>"Drink this, please," he said. "Now tell him quickly," he
whispered to Loveday.</p>
<p>"That young lady," she resumed calmly, "is your daughter Ren?.
She drove up with me and Lord Guilleroy from Langford Cross. Shall
I ask her to come in and see you? She is only waiting for Dr.
Godwin's permission to do so."</p>
<p>Time to grant or refuse that permission, however, was not
accorded to Dr. Godwin. Ren?&mdash;a sadder, sweeter-faced Ren?
than the one who had so impetuously discarded home and
father&mdash;now stood outside in the "half-sun, half-shade" of the
verandah, and had caught the sound of Loveday's last words.</p>
<p>She swept impetuously past her into the room.</p>
<p>"Father, father!" she said, as she knelt down beside his chair,
"I have come back at last! Are you not glad to see me?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I daresay it all seems very mysterious to you," said Loveday to
Inspector Ramsay, as together they paced the platform of Langford
Cross Station, waiting for the incoming of the London train, "but,
I assure you, it all admits of the easiest and simplest of
explanations&mdash;Who on earth was it that the inquest was held
over, and who was buried about a week ago, do you say? Oh, that was
Mr. Golding's wife, Iren?, daughter of Count Mascagni, of Alguida,
in South Italy, whom every one believed to be dead. It is her
history that holds the key to the whole affair from first to last.
I will begin at the beginning, and tell you her story as nearly as
possible as it was told to me. To be quite frank with you, I would
have admitted you long ago into my confidence, and told you, step
by step, how things were working themselves out, if you had not
offended me by criticizing my method of doing my work."</p>
<p>"I'm sure I'm very sorry," here broke in Ramsay in a deprecating
tone.</p>
<p>"Oh, pray don't mention it. Let me see, where was I? Ah, I must
go back some nineteen or twenty years in Mr. Golding's life in
order to make things clear to you. The particulars which I had from
Mr. Dyer, and which I fancy you supplied him with, respecting Mr.
Golding's early life were so meager that directly I arrived at the
Hall I set to work to supplement them; this I contrived to do in a
before-dinner chat with Lena, Miss Golding's maid. I found out
through her that Iren? Mascagni was a typical Italian woman of the
half-educated, passionate, beautiful, animal kind, and that Mr.
Golding's early married life was anything but a happy one. Iren?
was motherless, and had been so spoilt from babyhood upwards by her
old nurse, Lena's aunt, that she could not brook the slightest
opposition to her whims and wishes. She was a great coquette also;
lovers were an absolute necessity to her. Remonstrance on Mr.
Golding's part was useless; Iren? met it by appeals to her father
for protection against what she considered her husband's brutality;
in consequence, a serious quarrel ensued between the Count and Mr.
Golding, and when the latter announced his intention of breaking up
his Italian home and buying an estate in England, Iren?,
accompanied by her nurse, Antonia, left her husband and little
daughter and went back to her father's house, vowing that nothing
would induce her to leave her beloved Italy. At this crisis in his
affairs, Mr. Golding was suddenly compelled to undertake a journey
to Australia to adjust certain complicated matters of business. He
took with him on this voyage his little girl, Ren?, and her
nurse&mdash;now her maid, Lena. The visit to Australia in all
occupied about six months. During that time no communication of any
sort passed between him and his wife or her father. He resolved,
however, to make one more effort to induce Iren? to return to her
home and her duty; and, with this object, he went to Naples on his
return to Europe and wrote to his wife from there, asking her to
appoint a day for a meeting. In reply to this letter he received a
visit from Antonia, who, with a great show of sorrow, informed him
that Iren? had caught a fever during his absence, and had died, and
now lay buried in the family vault at Alguida. Mr. Golding's grief
at the tidings was no doubt mitigated by the recollection of the
unfortunate married life he had led. He made no attempt to
communicate with Count Mascagni, started at once for England, and
set up his establishment at Langford Hall. All this, with the
exception of the name of Iren?'s father and that of his estate, was
told me by Lena, who, I may mention in passing, laid great stress
upon the wonderful likeness that existed between Miss Golding and
her mother. She was, she said, the exact counterpart of what her
mother had been at her age."</p>
<p>"It is marvelous to me how you contrived to get anything out of
that woman Lena," said Ramsay; "she was most obstinately taciturn
with me."</p>
<p>"Pardon me if I say that was because she had been most
injudiciously handled. In the circumstances it would never have
occurred to me to put a single direct question to her, although I
like you, felt convinced that she was the one and only person
likely to be in her young mistress's confidence. So fully imbued
was I with this idea that I felt certain that, if she could be sent
out of the house on any pretext, by closely following her movements
we should, sooner or later, come upon the traces of Miss Golding.
To attain this end, I feigned suspicion of Mr. Gordon Cleeve, and
promised her rewards if she would bring me tidings of his doings.
This was to pave the way to dismissing her on a journey to Italy.
It also had the most welcome effect of calming her mind and
convincing her of my belief in her innocence. With her fears thus
allayed, I found her no longer sullen but communicative to a
degree."</p>
<p>"Pardon my interrupting you at this point, but will you kindly
tell me what, in the first instance, aroused your suspicious as to
the identity of the person 'found drowned' by the coroner's
jury?"</p>
<p>"Lena's conduct when the body was brought into the house. I
should, however, tell you that a keynote of suspicion as to the
possibility of Mrs. Golding being still alive had been struck when,
as I sat writing at Miss Golding's davenport, I found the words
"Mia Madre" scribbled here and there on her blotting-pad. Now what,
I said to myself, could, after all these years, have turned her
thoughts to her mother and her early Italian home? The wedding-ring
on the lady's finger, coupled with Lena's statement as to Miss
Golding's marvelous likeness to her mother, together with an
exclamation of Mr. Golding's, after identifying the body, that his
daughter had 'aged by a dozen years,' made these suspicions grow
stronger. It was, however, Lena's own conduct that resolved them
into positive certainty. I watched her narrowly after the body had
been brought into the house. At first her grief was passionate and
intense, and in it she let fall&mdash;in Italian&mdash;the
extraordinary exclamation that a woman should break her heart for
her lover, not for her mother. Then she, too, went into the room
where the body lay&mdash;went in weeping, came out dry-eyed, and in
the most methodical manner set to work to perform the last sad
offices for the dead."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, I see. Pray go on."</p>
<p>"It was on the day of the funeral, if you remember, that I
dispatched Lena to Paris. I had previously written to Lord
Guilleroy, hinting my suspicions, and begging him, in spite of
everything, to remain at Paris, and to carry out any directions I
might send him to the very letter. On dispatching Lena, I again
wrote to him, telling him when she would arrive, where she would
put up, and bidding him keep his eye on her, and follow her
movements step by step. From Paris, I sent Lena on to Naples,
bidding her await further orders there, and, all unknown to her,
the train that carried her thither, carried also Lord Guilleroy.
Naples had been the only place she had mentioned to me by name in
her gossip about her life in Italy, but I felt confident, from some
casual remarks she had let fall, that Iren? Mascagni's early home,
as well, also, as the home of her own lover, was within easy reach
of the city. It was only natural to conjecture that if I kept her
waiting there for orders she would utilize the opportunity for
paying a visit to her friends and relatives, and also to her young
mistress, if she were, as I supposed, in that neighbourhood. The
result proved my conjecture correct."</p>
<p>"And Lord Guilleroy, thus following her movements, step by step,
came upon her and Miss Golding in company?"</p>
<p>"He did. I think Lord Guilleroy deserves high encomium for the
way in which he performed his share in this somewhat intricate
case. No trained detective could have done better. He tracked Lena
home to Alguida, a small hamlet within fifteen miles of Naples, and
came upon her talking to Miss Golding, who stood at the gate of her
grandfather's chateau dressed in her mother's Neapolitan dress.
Miss Golding was unfeignedly glad to be taken possession of, so to
speak, by one of her father's English friends, for she was becoming
nervous and distressed at the position in which she found herself.
Her mother was dead; her grandfather, a man of a violent temper,
refused to allow her to leave his chateau, as he alleged he
required, in his old age, the attendance of one who was his own
kith and kin. Also there was in her mind a natural shrinking from
the story she would have to tell her father, and the fear lest he
might not be willing to forgive her for the part she had played.
Nothing could have been more opportune than Lord Guilleroy's
arrival. Miss Golding accorded to him her full confidence, and from
this point the story ceases to be mine and becomes Lord Guilleroy's
as communicated to him by Miss Golding."</p>
<p>"It is, in fact, the other half of the story that was told you
by Lena?"</p>
<p>"It is; it starts from the period, twelve years back, when Mrs.
Golding was supposed by her husband and child to be dead. Instead
of dying, however, she had, after a month's stay at her father's
lonely country house, joined a company of actors, then passing
through Alguida. Her great personal beauty ensured her ready
admission to the corps; and in her new life, no doubt, her vanity
and innate love of coquetry found ample gratification. The faithful
old nurse had followed her in her new career; the dramatic corps
was actually in Naples when Mr. Golding arrived there, and the two
women, neither of whom was disposed to enter upon the dull routine
of English domestic life, had fabricated the lie in order the more
effectually to retain their liberty. It is most probable that Count
Mascagni knew nothing whatever of his daughter's movements at this
period of her career. It is possible that, after a time, he may
have believed her to be dead, for eleven years passed without his
receiving any communication from her."</p>
<p>"Eleven years! Was she on the stage the whole of that time?"</p>
<p>"I have not been able to ascertain&mdash;in fact, I have not
been very keen in making inquiries on this point, for it really is
of little or no importance to the case. So far as we are concerned,
her career is of importance only after her return to her father's
house, now about a year ago. She came back one day, attended by
Antonia, evidently out of health and in great poverty. Her father
received her back conditionally; she had disgraced him and his
ancient name, he said; dead she was supposed to be by her friends,
dead she must remain&mdash;she must go nowhere, she must see no
one."</p>
<p>"Ah, a sad story! And I suppose after a time the poor woman's
thoughts flew to her husband and little daughter?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Antonia wrote to Lena that the mother was dying for the
sight of her child, and implored her to tell Ren? that her mother
lived&mdash;a mother who had been cruelly treated alike by husband
and father&mdash;and beg her, at all hazards, to come to her, that
she might clasp her in her arms before the shadows of death closed
in around her. This part of the story I had from Ren? herself as we
drove together to the Hall. The girl told me that when she read
that letter all her blood was stirred within her. She was seized
with a burning desire there and then to kiss that mother and to
right her wrongs. For the moment she hated her father, felt that
she must at once confront him and denounce him for his cruelty.
Second thoughts suggested another course. Her father might forbid
her all intercourse with her mother; she had plenty of money, why
not start for Italy at once, and from her mother's lips dictate to
her father the terms on which she would return to her English home?
So the journey was planned, and Lena was promised by the young lady
a pair of her handsome diamond earrings if she kept her secret till
she herself gave her permission to speak. Not so much as a hand-bag
was packed, for fear of exciting attention in the house; the
undistinctive blue serge and sailor hat&mdash;supplemented
subsequently by a thick veil&mdash;were selected as a travelling
dress. Market-day at Langford, with a crowded railway station, was
chosen for the day of departure, and the young lady walked the two
miles that lay between it and her father's house in easy, leisurely
fashion, as if she contemplated nothing more serious than a morning
walk."</p>
<p>"Of course, so soon as she reached London all was plain sailing
to her?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Lena, no doubt, supplied her with all necessary details
respecting her journey. When she arrived at the Chateau Mascagni,
she appears to have at once thoroughly succumbed to her mother's
influence. Out of health although that mother was, Ren? described
her to me as the most fascinating woman she had ever met. I suppose
the likeness between the two must have been something remarkable,
for Ren? said, after she had been a few days in the house and the
mother had rallied a little in strength, the servants declared it
was only by their dress that they could distinguish one from the
other. On the fourth day after Miss Golding's arrival at the
Chateau, her mother met her with a plan which, for fear of the
effect that a refusal might have upon her health, she at once fell
in with. It was to the effect that, instead of attempting
negotiations with Mr. Golding through lawyers or by letter, she
should herself go to him at his country house, throw herself upon
his generosity, plead for forgiveness, and beg to be taken back to
his heart once more."</p>
<p>"But why did not Miss Ren? accompany her mother on this
journey?"</p>
<p>"Ren? was a force to be held in reserve. If her father refused
her mother's request, she in her turn would refuse to return to her
home, but would live on with her mother and grandfather at Alguida.
The girl appears to have entertained bitter feelings against her
father at this juncture&mdash;feelings possibly intensified by the
thought of the sort of step-mother he intended to bestow upon
her."</p>
<p>"Well, anyhow, so far as I can make out, Miss Ren?'s own mother
hadn't much to boast of&mdash;in the way of common sense, at any
rate. In fact, the two together appear to me to have acted more
like a couple of school-girls than anything else. What made Mrs.
Golding dress up in her daughter's clothes?"</p>
<p>"That, I believe, was a matter of convenience merely. Mrs.
Golding had no money, and her father was not over-burdened with
riches, and what little he had he held tightly. She had, for some
reason or other, returned home with next to no wardrobe; Ren?'s
dress was suitable for travelling, and not likely to attract
attention. They neither of them seem to have given a thought to the
possibility of rewards being offered for tidings of Ren?; and thus,
no doubt, while waiting for her train in Paris, Mrs. Golding did
not hesitate to show herself in Paris streets. I need not go into
the details of her journey to Langford; they are already known to
you. The poor woman, not seeing any conveyance at the country
station, must have walked in the drenching rain to the Hall. At the
hall door, possibly, her courage suddenly failed her, and, instead
of ringing for admission, she creeps to a window to get a glimpse
of the home-life within. That glimpse is fatal. She sees her
husband and the woman he intends to marry seated together at table.
She takes in at a glance the refinement of the home, together with
the rigid conventionality of English domestic life. A wave of
memory, perhaps, brings before her episodes in her past career
altogether out of tune with this home picture. She feels the
impracticability of the mission on which she is bent; a fit of her
old impetuosity seizes her; she rushes away in the darkness, takes
a wrong turning, perhaps&mdash;who knows&mdash;?"</p>
<p>"Ah, yes; and the stream was there waiting for her, and she
thought she would end it all. Poor soul!"</p>
<p>"Or it may be," said Loveday pityingly, "that some sweet story
of sainthood and martyrdom that she had heard in her childish days
came floating dimly into her brain as she made her way through the
darkness, and she thought she would do her best to make atonement
to the one whom she had so deeply injured by not standing in the
way of his future happiness. Here is my train! Ah, yes; it is a
sad, sad story!"</p>
<p>"Yes; for the present things are a trifle gloomy for the family
at the Hall, I'll admit," said Ramsay, as he shut the carriage-door
on Loveday; "but they'll turn over a new leaf there before long.
There'll be a couple of weddings in the house before the year comes
to an end, I'll be bound."</p>
<p>"No," said Loveday, as she steeled herself comfortably in a
corner; "Mrs. Greenhow has shown herself in her true colours at
this time of distress, and, from what I hear, will stand but little
chance of becoming the second Mrs. Golding. Lord Guilleroy and the
runaway Ren? are the only two who will have to be congratulated as
bride and bridegroom."</p>
