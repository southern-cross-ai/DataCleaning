  <h3>First published in <i>Fantasy Magazine</i>, April 1934<br>
  Also published as "Rhythm Of The Spheres" (<i>Thrilling Wonder Stories</i>,
  October 1936)</h3><br>

  <p class="first">NARODNY, the Russian, sat in his laboratory. Narodny's
  laboratory was a full mile under earth. It was one of a hundred caverns, some
  small and some vast, cut out of the living rock. It was a realm of which he
  was sole ruler. In certain caverns garlands of small suns shone; and in
  others little moons waxed and waned over earth; and there was a cavern in
  which reigned perpetual dawn, dewy, over lily beds and violets and roses; and
  another in which crimson sunsets baptized in the blood of slain day dimmed
  and died and were born again behind the sparkling curtains of the aurora. And
  there was one cavern ten miles from side to side in which grew flowering
  trees and trees which bore fruits unknown to man for many generations. Over
  this great orchard one yellow sun-like orb shone, and clouds trailed veils of
  rain upon the trees and miniature thunder drummed at Narodny's summoning.</p>

  <p>Narodny was a poet&mdash;the last poet. He did not write his poems in
  words but in colors, sounds, and visions made material. Also he was a great
  scientist. In his peculiar field the greatest. Thirty years before, Russia's
  Science Council had debated whether to grant him the leave of absence he had
  asked, or to destroy him. They knew him to be unorthodox. How deadly so they
  did not know, else after much deliberation they would not have released him.
  It must be remembered that of all nations, Russia then was the most
  mechanized; most robot-ridden.</p>

  <p>Narodny did not hate mechanization. He was indifferent to it. Being truly
  intelligent he hated nothing, Also he was indifferent to the whole
  civilization man had developed and into which he had been born. He had no
  feeling of kinship to humanity. Outwardly, in body, he belonged to the
  species. Not so in mind. Like Loeb, a thousand years before, he considered
  mankind a race of crazy half-monkeys, intent upon suicide. Now and then, out
  of the sea of lunatic mediocrity, a wave uplifted that held for a moment a
  light from the sun of truth&mdash;but soon it sank back and the light was
  gone. Quenched in the sea of stupidity. He knew that he was one of those
  waves.</p>

  <p>He had gone, and he had been lost to sight by all. In a few years he was
  forgotten. Fifteen years ago, unknown and under another name, he had entered
  America and secured rights to a thousand acres in what of old had been called
  Westchester. He had picked this place because investigation had revealed to
  him that of ten localities on this planet it was most free from danger of
  earthquake or similar seismic disturbance. The man who owned it had been
  whimsical; possibly an atavist&mdash;like Narodny, although Narodny would
  never have thought of himself as that. At any rate, instead of an angled
  house of glass such as the thirtieth century built, this man had
  reconstructed a rambling old stone house of the nineteenth century. Few
  people lived upon the open land in those days; most had withdrawn into the
  city-states. New York, swollen by its meals of years, was a fat belly full of
  mankind still many miles away. The land around the house was
  forest-covered.</p>

  <p>A week after Narodny had taken this house, the trees in front of it had
  melted away leaving a three-acre, smooth field. It was not as though they had
  been cut, but as though they had been dissolved. Later that night a great
  airship had appeared upon this field&mdash;abruptly, as though it had blinked
  out of another dimension. It was rocket-shaped but noiseless. And immediately
  a fog had fallen upon airship and house, hiding them. Within this fog, if one
  could have seen, was a wide tunnel leading from the air-cylinder's door to
  the door of the house. And out of the airship came swathed figures, ten of
  them, who walked along that tunnel, were met by Narodny, and the door of the
  old house closed on them.</p>

  <p>A little later they returned, Narodny with them, and out of an opened
  hatch of the airship rolled a small flat car on which was a mechanism of
  crystal cones rising around each other to a central cone some four feet high.
  The cones were upon a thick base of some glassy material in which was
  imprisoned a restless green radiance. Its rays did not penetrate that which
  held it, but it seemed constantly seeking, with suggestion of prodigious
  force, to escape. For hours the strange thick fog held. Twenty miles up in
  the far reaches of the stratosphere, a faintly sparkling cloud grew, like a
  condensation of cosmic dust. And just before dawn the rock of the hill behind
  the house melted away like a curtain that had covered a great tunnel. Five of
  the men came out of the house and went into the airship. It lifted silently
  from the ground, slipped into the aperture and vanished. There was a
  whispering sound, and when it had died away the breast of the hill was whole
  again. The rocks had been drawn together like a closing curtain and boulders
  studded it as before. That the breast was now slightly concave where before
  it had been convex, none would have noticed.</p>

  <p>For two weeks the sparkling cloud was observed far up in the stratosphere,
  was commented upon idly, and then was seen no more. Narodny's caverns were
  finished.</p>

  <p>Half of the rock from which they had been hollowed had gone with that
  sparkling cloud. The balance, reduced to its primal form of energy, was
  stored in blocks of the vitreous material that had supported the cones, and
  within them it moved as restlessly and always with that same suggestion of
  prodigious force. And it was force, unthinkably potent; from it came the
  energy that made the little suns and moons, and actuated the curious
  mechanisms that regulated pressure in the caverns, supplied the air, created
  the rain, and made of Narodny's realm a mile deep under earth the Paradise of
  poetry, of music, of color and of form which he had conceived in his brain
  and with the aid of those ten others had caused to be.</p>

  <p>Now of the ten there is no need to speak further. Narodny was the Master.
  But three, like him, were Russians; two were Chinese; of the remaining five,
  three were women&mdash;one German in ancestry, one Basque, one an Eurasian; a
  Hindu who traced his descent from the line of Gautama; a Jew who traced his
  from Solomon.</p>

  <p>All were one with Narodny in indifference to the world; each with him in
  his viewpoint on life; and each and all lived in his or her own Eden among
  the hundred caverns except when it interested them to work with each other.
  Time meant nothing to them. Their researches and discoveries were solely for
  their own uses and enjoyments. If they had given them to the outer world they
  would have only been ammunition for warfare either between men upon Earth or
  men against some other planet. Why hasten humanity's suicide? Not that they
  would have felt regret at the eclipse of humanity. But why trouble to
  expedite it? Time meant nothing to them because they could live as long as
  they desired&mdash;barring accident. And while there was rock in the world,
  Narodny could convert it into energy to maintain his Paradise&mdash;or to
  create others.</p>

  <p>The old house began to crack and crumble. It fell&mdash;much more quickly
  than the elements could have brought about its destruction. Then trees grew
  among the ruins of its foundations; and the field that had been so strangely
  cleared was overgrown with trees. The land became a wood in a few short
  years; silent except for the roar of an occasional rocket passing over it and
  the songs of birds that had found there a sanctuary.</p>

  <p>But deep down in earth, within the caverns, were music and song and mirth
  and beauty. Gossamer nymphs circled under the little moons. Pan piped. There
  was revelry of antique harvesters under the small suns. Grapes grew and
  ripened, were pressed, and red and purple wine was drunk by Bacchantes who
  fell at last asleep in the arms of fauns and satyrs. Oreads danced under the
  pale moon-bows and sometimes Centaurs wheeled and trod archaic measures
  beneath them to the drums of their hoofs upon the mossy floor. The old Earth
  lived again.</p>

  <p>Narodny listened to drunken Alexander raving to Thais among the splendors
  of conquered Persepolis; and he heard the crackling of the flames that at the
  whim of the courtesan destroyed it. He watched the siege of Troy and counted
  with Homer the Achaean ships drawn up on the strand before Troy's walls; or
  saw with Herodotus the tribes that marched behind Xerxes&mdash;the Caspians
  in their cloaks of skin with their bows of cane; the Ethiopians in the skins
  of leopards with spears of antelope horns; the Libyans in their dress of
  leather with javelins made hard by fire; the Thracians with the heads of
  foxes upon their heads; the Moschians who wore helmets made of wood and the
  Cabalians who wore the skulls of men. For him the Eleusinian and the Osirian
  mysteries were re-enacted, and he watched the women of Thrace tear to
  fragments Orpheus, the first great musician. At his will, he could see the
  rise and fall of the Empire of the Aztecs, the Empire of the Incas; or
  beloved Caesar slain in Rome's Senate; or the archers at Agincourt; or the
  Americans in Belleau Wood. Whatever man had written&mdash;whether poets,
  historians, philosophers or scientists&mdash;his strangely shaped mechanisms
  could bring before him, changing the words into phantoms real as though
  living.</p>

  <p>He was the last and greatest of the poets&mdash;but also he was the last
  and greatest of the musicians. He could bring back the songs of ancient
  Egypt, or the chants of more ancient Ur. The songs that came from
  Moussorgsky's soul of Mother-earth, the harmonies of Beethoven's deaf ear, or
  the chants and rhapsodies from the heart of Chopin. He could do more than
  restore the music of the past. He was master of sound. To him, the music of
  the spheres was real. He could take the rays of the stars and planets and
  weave them into symphonies. Or convert the sun's rays into golden tones no
  earthly orchestras had ever expressed. And the silver music of the moon
  &mdash;the sweet music of the moon of spring, the full-throated music of the
  harvest moon, the brittle crystalling music of the winter moon with its
  arpeggios of meteors&mdash;he could weave into strains such as no human ears
  had ever heard.</p>

  <p>So Narodny, the last and greatest of poets, the last and greatest of
  musicians, the last and greatest of artists&mdash;and in his inhuman way, the
  greatest of scientists&mdash;lived with the ten of his choosing in his
  caverns. And, with them, he consigned the surface of earth and all who dwelt
  upon it to a negative Hell&mdash;Unless something happening there might
  imperil his Paradise!</p>

  <p>Aware of the possibility of that danger, among his mechanisms were those
  which brought to eyes and ears news of what was happening on earth's surface.
  Now and then, they amused themselves with these.</p>

  <p>It so happened that on that night when the Warper of Space had dealt his
  blow at the space ships and had flung a part of the great Crater of
  Copernicus into another dimension, Narodny had been weaving the rays of Moon,
  Jupiter and Saturn into Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. The moon was a four-day
  crescent. Jupiter was at one cusp, and Saturn hung like a pendant below the
  bow. Shortly Orion would stride across the Heavens and bright Regulus and red
  Aldebaran, the Eye of the Bull, would furnish him with other chords of
  starlight remoulded into sound.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the woven rhythms were ripped&mdash;hideously. A devastating
  indescribable dissonance invaded the cavern. Beneath it, the nymphs who had
  been dancing languorously to the strains quivered like mist wraiths in a
  sudden blast and were gone: the little moons flared, then ceased to glow. The
  tonal instruments were dead. And Narodny was felled as though by a blow.</p>

  <p>After a time the little moons began to glow again, but dimly; and from the
  tonal mechanisms came broken, crippled music. Narodny stirred and sat up, his
  lean, high-cheeked face more Satanic than ever. Every nerve was numb; then as
  they revived, agony crept along them. He sat, fighting the agony, until he
  could summon help. He was answered by one of the Chinese, and soon Narodny
  was himself again.</p>

  <p>He said: "It was a spatial disturbance, Lao. And it was like nothing I
  have ever known. It came in upon the rays, of that I am sure. Let us look out
  upon the moon."</p>

  <p>They passed to another cavern and stood before an immense television
  screen. They adjusted it, and upon it appeared the moon, rapidly growing
  larger as though it were hurtling toward them. Then upon the screen appeared
  a space-ship speeding earthward. They focused upon it, and opened it to their
  vision; searching it until they came to the control room where were
  Bartholomew, James Tarvish and Martin, their gaze upon Earth rapidly and more
  rapidly expanding in the heavens. Narodny and the Chinese watched them,
  reading their lips. Tarvish said: "Where can we land, Martin? The robots will
  be watching for us everywhere. They will see to it that we are destroyed
  before we can give our message and our warning to the world. They control the
  governments&mdash;or at least control them sufficiently to seize us upon
  landing. And if we should escape and gather men around us, then it means
  civil war and that in turn means fatal delay in the building of the space
  fleet&mdash;even if we should win."</p>

  <p>Martin said: "We must land safely&mdash;escape the robots&mdash;find some
  to control or destroy them. God, Tarvish&mdash;you saw what that devil they
  call the Wrongness of Space can do. He threw the side of the crater out of
  our dimension as a boy would throw a stone into a pond!"</p>

  <p>Bartholomew said: "He could take Earth and break it up piecemeal!"</p>

  <p>Narodny and Lao looked at each other. Narodny said: "That is enough. We
  know." The Chinese nodded. Narodny said: "I estimated that they would reach
  Earth in four hours." Again Lao nodded. Narodny said: "We will talk to them,
  Lao; although I had thought we were done with mankind. I do not like this
  which they call so quaintly the Wrongness of Space&mdash;nor the stone he
  threw into my music."</p>

  <p>They brought a smaller screen into position before the larger one. They
  oriented it to the speeding space-ship and stepped in front of it. The small
  screen shimmered with whirling vortices of pallid blue luminescence; the
  vortices drew together and became one vast cone that reached on and on to the
  greater screen as though not feet but thousands of miles separated them. And
  as the tip of the cone touched the control room of the space-ship mirrored in
  the screen, Tarvish, upon the actual ship, gripped Martin's arm.</p>

  <p>"Look there!"</p>

  <p>There was an eddying in the air, like that over roads on a hot summer day.
  The eddying became a shimmering curtain of pallid blue luminescence&mdash;
  steadied until it was an oval doorway opening into vast distances. And then
  abruptly, within that doorway, stood two men&mdash;one tall and lean and
  saturnine with the sensitive face of a dreamer and the other a Chinese, his
  head a great yellow dome and on his face the calm of Buddha&mdash;and it was
  strange indeed to see in the cavern of earth these same two men standing
  before the blue-coned screen and upon the greater one their images within the
  imaged room on which the tip of the cone rested.</p>

  <p>Narodny spoke, and in his voice there was a human indifference and
  sureness that chilled them, yet gave them courage. He said: "We mean you no
  harm. You cannot harm us. We have long been withdrawn from men. What happens
  on the surface of Earth means nothing to us. What may happen beneath the
  surface means much. Whatever it is you have named the Wrongness of Space has
  already annoyed me. I perceive that he can do more than annoy. I gather that
  the robots in one way or another are on his side. You are against him.
  Therefore, our first step must be to help you against the robots. Place me in
  possession of all facts. Be brief, for we cannot maintain our position here
  for more than half an hour without discomfort."</p>

  <p>Martin said: "Whoever you are, wherever you are, we trust you. Here is the
  story&mdash;"</p>

  <p>For fifteen minutes Narodny and the Chinese listened to their tale of
  struggle against the robots, of their escape and of the blasting of
  Copernicus in the effort of the Wrongness of Space to prevent their
  return.</p>

  <p>Narodny said: "Enough. Now I understand. How long can you remain in space?
  I mean&mdash;what are your margins of power and of food?"</p>

  <p>Martin answered: "Six days."</p>

  <p>Narodny said: "Ample time for success&mdash;or failure. Remain aloft for
  that time, then descend to where you started&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he smiled: "I care nothing for mankind&mdash;yet I would not harm
  them, willingly. And it has occurred to me that I owe them, after all, a
  great debt. Except for them&mdash;I would not be. Also, it occurs to me that
  the robots have never produced a poet, a musician, an artist&mdash;" He
  laughed: "But it is in my mind that they are capable of one great art at
  least! We shall see."</p>

  <p>The oval was abruptly empty; then it too was gone. Bartholomew said: "Call
  the others. I am for obeying. But they must know." And when the others had
  heard, they too voted to obey, and the space-ship, course changed, began to
  circle, as slowly as it could, the earth.</p>

  <p>Down in the chamber of the screens, Narodny laughed and laughed again. He
  said: "Lao, is it that we have advanced so in these few years? Or that men
  have retrogressed? No, it is this curse of mechanization that destroys
  imagination. For look you, how easy is this problem of the robots. They began
  as man-made machines. Mathematical, soulless, insensible to any emotion. So
  was primal matter of which all on earth are made, rock and water, tree and
  grass, metal, animal, fish, worm, and men. But somewhere, somehow, something
  was added to this primal matter, combined with it&mdash;used it. It was what
  we call life. And life is consciousness. And therefore largely emotion. Life
  established its rhythm&mdash;and its rhythm being different in rock and
  crystal, metal, fish, and so on, and man, we have these varying things.</p>

  <p>"Well, it seems that life has begun to establish its rhythm in the robots.
  Consciousness has touched them. The proof? They have established the idea of
  common identity&mdash;group consciousness. That in itself involves emotion.
  But they have gone further. They have attained the instinct of self-
  preservation. And that, my wise friend, connotes fear&mdash;fear of
  extinction. And fear connotes anger, hatred, arrogance&mdash;and many other
  things. The robots, in short, have become emotional to a degree. And
  therefore vulnerable to whatever may amplify and control their emotions. They
  are no longer mechanisms.</p>

  <p>"So, Lao, I have in mind an experiment that will provide me study and
  amusement through many years. Originally, the robots are the children of
  mathematics. I ask&mdash;to what is mathematics most closely related. I
  answer&mdash;to rhythm&mdash;to sound&mdash;to sounds which will raise to the
  nth degree the rhythms to which they will respond. Both mathematically and
  emotionally,"</p>

  <p>Lao said: "The sonic sequences?"</p>

  <p>Narodny answered: "Exactly. But we must have a few with which to
  experiment. To do that means to dissolve the upper gate. But that is nothing.
  Tell Maringy and Euphroysne to do it. Net a ship and bring it here. Bring it
  down gently. You will have to kill the men in it, of course, but do it
  mercifully. Then let them bring me the robots. Use the green flame on one or
  two&mdash;the rest will follow, I'll warrant you."</p>

  <p>The hill behind where the old house had stood trembled. A circle of pale
  green light gleamed on its breast. It dimmed, where it had been was the black
  mouth of a tunnel. An airship, half-rocket, half-winged, making its way to
  New York, abruptly dropped, circled, and streaked back. It fell gently like a
  moth, close to the yawning mouth of the tunnel.</p>

  <p>Its door opened, and out came two men, pilots, cursing. There was a little
  sigh from the tunnel's mouth and a silvery misty cloud sped from it, over the
  pilots and straight through the opened door. The pilots staggered and
  crumpled to the ground. In the airship half a dozen other men slumped to the
  floor, smiled, and died.</p>

  <p>There were a full score robots in the ship. They stood, looking at the
  dead men and at each other. Out of the tunnel came two figures swathed in
  metallic glimmering robes. They entered the ship. One said:</p>

  <p>"Robots, assemble."</p>

  <p>The metal men stood, motionless. Then one sent out a shrill call. From all
  parts of the ship the metal men moved. They gathered behind the one who had
  sent the call. They stood behind him, waiting.</p>

  <p>In the hand of one of those who had come from the tunnel was what might
  have been an antique flash-light. From it sped a thin green flame. It struck
  the foremost robot on the head, sliced down from the head to base of trunk.
  Another flash, and the green flame cut him from side to side. He fell, sliced
  by that flame into four parts. The four parts lay, inert as their metal, upon
  the floor of the compartment.</p>

  <p>One of the shrouded figures said: "Do you want further demonstration
  &mdash;or will you follow us?"</p>

  <p>The robots put heads together; whispered. Then one said: "We will
  follow."</p>

  <p>They marched into the tunnel, the robots making no resistance nor effort
  to escape. Again there was the sighing, and the rocks closed the tunnel
  mouth. They came to a place whose floor sank with them until it had reached
  the caverns. The machine-men still went docilely. Was it because of curiosity
  mixed with disdain for these men whose bodies could be broken so easily by
  one blow of the metal appendages that served them for arms? Perhaps.</p>

  <p>They came to the cavern where Narodny and the others awaited them.
  Marinoff led them in and halted them. These were the robots used in the
  flying ships&mdash;their heads cylindrical, four arm appendages, legs triple
  jointed, torsos slender. The robots, it should be understood, were
  differentiated in shape according to their occupations. Narodny said:</p>

  <p>"Welcome, robots. Who is your leader?"</p>

  <p>One answered: "We have no leaders. We act as one."</p>

  <p>Narodny laughed: "Yet by speaking for them you have shown yourself leader.
  Step closer. Do not fear&mdash;yet."</p>

  <p>The robot said: "We feel no fear. Why should we? Even if you should
  destroy us who are here, you cannot destroy the billions of us outside. Nor
  can you breed fast enough, become men soon enough, to cope with us who enter
  into life strong and complete from the beginning."</p>

  <p>He flicked an appendage toward Narodny and there was contempt in the
  gesture. But before he could draw it back a bracelet of green flame circled
  it at the shoulder. It had darted like a thrown loop from something in
  Narodny's hand. The robot's arm dropped clanging to the floor, cleanly
  severed. The robot stared at it unbelievingly, threw forward his other three
  arms to pick it up. Again the green flame encircled them, encircled also his
  legs above the second joints. The robot crumpled and pitched forward, crying
  in high-pitched shrill tones to the others.</p>

  <p>Swiftly the green flame played among them. Legless, armless, some
  decapitated, all the robots fell except two.</p>

  <p>"Two will be enough," said Narodny. "But they will not need arms&mdash;
  only feet."</p>

  <p>The flashing green bracelets encircled the appendages and excised them.
  The pair were marched away. The bodies of the others were taken apart,
  studied and under Narodny's direction curious experiments were made. Music
  filled the cavern, strange chords, unfamiliar progressions, shattering
  arpeggios and immense vibrations of sound that could be felt but not heard by
  the human ear. And finally this last deep vibration burst into hearing as a
  vast drone, hummed up and up into swift tingling tempest of crystalline
  brittle notes, and still ascending passed into shrill high pipings, and
  continued again unheard, as had the prelude to the droning. And thence it
  rushed back, the piping and the crystalline storm reversed, into the drone
  and the silence&mdash;then back and up.</p>

  <p>And the bodies of the broken robots began to quiver, to tremble, as though
  every atom within them were in ever increasing, rhythmic motion. Up rushed
  the music and down&mdash;again and again. If ended abruptly in midflight with
  one crashing note.</p>

  <p>The broken bodies ceased their quivering. Tiny starshaped cracks appeared
  in their metal. Once more the note sounded and the cracks widened. The metal
  splintered.</p>

  <p>Narodny said: "Well, there is the frequency for the rhythm of our robots.
  The destructive unison. I hope for the sake of the world outside it is not
  also the rhythm of many of their buildings and bridges. But after all, in any
  war there must be casualties on both sides."</p>

  <p>Lao said: "Earth will be an extraordinary spectacle for a few days."</p>

  <p>Narodny said: "It's going to be an extraordinarily uncomfortable Earth for
  a few days, and without doubt many will die and many more go mad. But is
  there any other way?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer. He said; "Bring in the two robots." They brought them
  in.</p>

  <p>Narodny said: "Robots&mdash;were there ever any of you who could
  poetize?"</p>

  <p>They answered: "What is poetize?" Narodny laughed: "Never mind. Have you
  ever sung&mdash;made music&mdash;painted? Have you ever&mdash; dreamed?"</p>

  <p>One robot said with cold irony: "Dreamed? No&mdash;for we do not sleep. We
  leave all that to men. It is why we have conquered them."</p>

  <p>Narodny said, almost gently: "Not yet, robot. Have you ever&mdash; danced?
  No? It is an art you are about to learn."</p>

  <p>The unheard note began, droned up and through the tempest and away and
  back again. And up and down&mdash;and up and down, though not so loudly as
  before. And suddenly the feet of the robots began to move, to shuffle. Their
  leg-joints bent; their bodies swayed. The note seemed to move now here and
  now there about the chamber, they always following it, grotesquely. Like huge
  metal marionettes, they followed it. The music ended in the crashing note.
  And it was as though every vibrating atom of the robot bodies had met some
  irresistible obstruction. Their bodies quivered and from their voice
  mechanisms came a shriek that was a hideous blend of machine and life. Once
  more the drone, and once more and once more and again the abrupt stop. There
  was a brittle crackling all over the conical heads, all over the bodies. The
  star-shaped splinterings appeared. Once again the drone&mdash;but the two
  robots stood, unresponding. For through the complicated mechanisms which
  under their carapaces animated them were similar splinterings.</p>

  <p>The robots were dead!</p>

  <p>Narodny said: "By tomorrow we can amplify the sonor to make it effective
  in a 3000-mile circle. We will use the upper cavern, of course. Equally of
  course, it means we must take the ship out again. In three days, Marinoff,
  you should be able to cover the other continents. See to it that the ship is
  completely proof against the vibrations. To work. We must act quickly&mdash;
  before the robots can discover how to neutralize them."</p>

  <p>It was exactly at noon next day that over all North America a deep
  unexplainable droning was heard. It seemed to come not only from deep within
  earth, but from every side. It mounted rapidly through a tempest of tingling
  crystalline notes into a shrill piping and was gone... then back it rushed
  from piping to the drone... then up and out and down... again and again. And
  over all North America the hordes of robots stopped in whatever they were
  doing. Stopped... and then began to dance. They danced in the airships and
  scores of those ships crashed before the human crews could gain control. They
  danced by the thousands in the streets of the cities&mdash;in grotesque
  rigadoons, in bizarre sarabands, with shuffle and hop, and jig the robots
  danced while the people fled in panic and hundreds of them were crushed and
  died in those panics. In the great factories, and in the tunnels of the lower
  cities, and in the mines&mdash;everywhere the sound was heard&mdash;and it
  was heard everywhere&mdash;the robots danced... to the piping of Narodny, the
  last great poet... the last great musician.</p>

  <p>And then came the crashing note&mdash;and over all the country the dance
  halted. And began again... and ceased... and began again...</p>

  <p>Until at last the streets, the lower tunnels of the lower levels, the
  mines, the factories, the homes, were littered with metal bodies shot through
  and through with star-shaped splinterings.</p>

  <p>In the cities the people cowered, not knowing what blow was to fall upon
  them... or milled about in fear-maddened crowds, and many more died...</p>

  <p>Then suddenly the dreadful droning, the shattering tempest, the
  intolerable high piping ended. And everywhere the people fell, sleeping among
  the dead robots, as though they never had been strung to the point of
  breaking, sapped of strength and abruptly relaxed.</p>

  <p>As though it had vanished, America was deaf to cables, to all
  communication beyond the gigantic circle of sound.</p>

  <p>But that midnight over all Europe the drone sounded and Europe's robots
  began their dance of death... and when it had ended a strange and silent
  rocket ship that had hovered high above the stratosphere sped almost with the
  speed of light and hovered over Asia&mdash;and next day Africa heard the
  drone while the natives answered it with their tom-toms&mdash;then South
  America heard it and last of all far-off Australia... and everywhere terror
  trapped the peoples and panic and madness took their toll...</p>

  <p>Until of all that animate metal horde that had tethered Earth and humanity
  there were a few scant hundreds left&mdash;escaped from the death dance
  through some variant in their constitution. And, awakening from that swift
  sleep, all over Earth those who had feared and hated the robots and their
  slavery rose against those who had fostered the metal domination, and blasted
  the robot factories to dust.</p>

  <p>Again the hill above the caverns opened, the strange torpedo ship blinked
  into sight like a ghost, as silently as a ghost floated into the hill and the
  rocks closed behind it.</p>

  <p>Narodny and the others stood before the gigantic television screen,
  shifting upon it images of city after city, country after country, over all
  Earth's surface. Lao, the Chinese, said: "Many men died, but many are left.
  They may not understand&mdash;but to them it was worth it."</p>

  <p>Narodny mused: "It drives home the lesson, what man does not pay for, he
  values little. Our friends aloft will have little opposition now I
  think."</p>

  <p>He shook his head, doubtfully, "But I still do not like that Wrongness of
  Space. I do not want my music spoiled again by him, Lao. Shall we hurl the
  Moon out of the universe, Lao?"</p>

  <p>Lao laughed: "And what then would you do for moon-music?"</p>

  <p>Narodny said: "True. Well, let us see what men can do. There is always
  time&mdash;perhaps."</p>

  <p>The difficulties which beset humanity did not interest the poet Narodny.
  While the world governments were reorganized&mdash;factories turned out space
  ships for Earth's fleet&mdash;men were trained in handling these
  ships&mdash;supplies were gathered&mdash;weapons were perfected&mdash; and
  when the message from Luna, outlining the course to be followed and setting
  the starting date, arrived, the space fleet of Earth was ready to leave.</p>

  <p>Narodny watched the ships take off. He shook his head, doubtfully. But
  soon harmonies were swelling through the great cavern of the orchards and
  nymphs and fauns dancing under the fragrant blossoming trees&mdash;and the
  world was again forgotten by Narodny.</p><br>
