  <h1>When Old Gods Wake<br>
  <small>(a fragment)</small></h1>

  <h4>by</h4>

  <h2>Abraham Merritt</h2>

  <h3>Written ca. 1940</h3>

  <p class="note">This fragment is thought to be the beginning of a planned
  sequel to the novel <i>The Face In The Abyss</i>.</p>

 <h2>I. ALTAR OF KUKULKAN</h2>

  <p class="first">THE silence seemed to be focused within the temple; to have
  its heart there; a heart that did not need to beat, since all the silence was
  alive. Outside the heat of the Yucatan midday held the ruins in breathless
  grip. Barry Manson, crouching at the base of the ancient altar, thought: the
  silence... marched... marched into the temple. The shrieks of the parrots
  were cut off first. .. then the little blue and yellow birds stopped
  quarreling in the crimson fruited tree at the base of the shattered
  stairway... and then the silence marched up the stairway and into this
  chamber and crowded against the seaward side... and that shut out the swish
  of the waves.</p>

  <p>He looked at Joan. She sat a few paces away, her back against the massive
  pedestal of a broken pillar. Her hands were clasped around her knees. Her
  eyes were intent upon the wall behind the altar. A painting once had covered
  that wall. The fingers of time, working patiently through the centuries, had
  plucked away most of the stucco that had carried it. But above the altar, as
  though protected by its shadow, a large and irregular fragment remained. Upon
  it, colors still vivid, Were the head and shoulders of Kukulkan, God of the
  Air of the ancient Mayans&mdash;and much more than that.</p>

  <p>The Feathered Serpent, his symbol and his avatar, floated over him, fanged
  jaws agape, plumed wings spread wide. The face of Kukulkan was the
  conventionalized one of the New Empire; the nose grotesquely lengthened like
  that of a tapir, lips thick and protruding, prognathous-jawed, bat-eared; the
  ears ringed and the labret through the nostrils; head plumed with the sacred
  panacho.</p>

  <p>The painted gaze of the god seemed fixed as intently upon the girl as hers
  upon him.</p>

  <p>The pedestal against which Joan leaned was covered with carved figures of
  priests of Kukulkan who had served him when ruined Tuloom had been one of the
  great cities of the Mayans, and this its holiest temple. On these figures the
  colors were also bright. Into them Joan&rsquo;s copper hair melted, merged
  with their reds and ochres so that for an instant Barry had the illusion that
  her face was all of her.</p>

  <p>A disembodied face peering out of the stone and holding communion with the
  god like a summoned priestess.</p>

  <p>Impatiently Barry arose and walked over to her. She dis not look up. She
  whispered, eyes still absorbed by the painted god:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t break the silence, Barry! It&rsquo;s like the silence
  that wraps the city of Jade... where the thousand sages of T&rsquo;zan
  T&rsquo;zao sit holding fast to the thought that created the world... and
  that the ghost of a ghost of a sound would destroy... and with it the
  world....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He felt increase of revolt against the fantasies gathering about him. He
  shook his shoulders and laughed. He said, loudly:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The silence is broken, Joan&mdash;and the world still
  spins.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was true. The silence was broken. It was retreat ing from the chamber,
  slowly... marching away as it had marched in. Faintly came the swish of the
  waves, growing ever stronger. The silence was marching out of the chamber
  toward the shattered stairway up which it had come. Joan arose, slowly... it
  was odd, Barry thought, how every movement of hers in rising kept to the
  rhythm, kept to the beat, of the unseen and unheard feet of the retreating
  silence.</p>

  <p>The silence marched down the stairway. He heard again the quarreling of
  the little blue and yellow birds... then the shrieks of the parrots....</p>

  <p>Joan said, unsteadily: &ldquo;It was time you did that, Barry. It was...
  doing things to me. Look, Barry&mdash;look...!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He followed her finger, pointing to the painted face of Kukulkan. For a
  breath he saw it... another face looking out from the wall.</p>

  <p>An ageless face... the nose long and curved and delicate. The lips full
  but sharply cut, archaically sensuous... hair as red as his own and eyes as
  blue as. Joan&rsquo;s. A face as devoid of human equivalence as it was
  timeless... yet human... as though the seed from which it had sprung into
  godhood had been human. Incalculable, unreadable... but still within it
  something that could be read up to that point where the humanness of it
  merged into the god... might be read more plainly if the god would within it
  merge more fully into the humanness. Nothing of benevolence in it... but
  neither was there shade of malevolence, cruelty... humanless, in human
  mask.</p>

  <p>Barry thought: it is like that mountain peak in the City of Jade of which
  Joan spoke... the peak shaped like the head of a man and all of clearest
  crystal to which the thoughts of men are drawn... all their thoughts... and
  pass from its eyes and mouth cleansed of falsehood and of error, prejudice
  and hatred and love... standing naked and stark before T&rsquo;zan T&rsquo;wo
  to be judged....</p>

  <p>Power was in the face, immense power... and something of wildness, of
  freedom... the freedom of primaeval things... like the wind, the waves, the
  sun....</p>

  <p>And then the face was gone. Upon the wall was the tapir snout of Kukulkan,
  the protruding lips, the fanged and feathered serpent.</p>

  <p>His hand was clenching Joan&rsquo;s wrist. She whispered:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You saw it! You&rsquo;re hurting me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He dropped her wrist. He said: &ldquo;It is another painting beneath this
  one. An older painting. Some trick of the light brought it out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She said, doubtful: &ldquo;Maybe. But I think it was Kukulkan as the first
  Mayans knew him. Kukulkan who came to them from still an older race. Kukulkan
  when he was worshipped with flowers and fruits and incense and prayer. Before
  his worship was debased and the cruel human sacrifices began. That was when
  and why he turned from the Mayans. And so their doom came swiftly upon them.
  For it was never he who came to them thereafter, Barry. It was an evil god
  hiding behind his mask and name&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She hesitated, seemed listening: &ldquo;But yes&mdash;he did come. Came
  even to the Aztecs, who steeped his rites in even greater cruelties and
  renamed him Quetzalcoatl... came again and again to thwart that other god
  when his evil grew too strong... the Lord of Darkness, the Lord of the
  Dead.... "</p>

  <p>Her voice died; she stood with eyes rapt, face colorless, bent as though
  listening. He took her by the shoulders, shook her:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Snap out of it, Joan. What&rsquo;s the matter with you?
  You&rsquo;re talking nonsense.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I, Barry? It was what Kukulkan was telling me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She dropped her head on his shoulder; clung to him, trembling. His hands
  slipped from her shoulders, drew her to him. He said huskily:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Coming any closer to loving me, Joan?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes to his frankly, yet with something of regret lurking
  in them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorry, Barry dear. But it&rsquo;s still the same.
  I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He interrupted her, speaking monotonously: &ldquo;Like you better than any
  other man I know, except Bill, of course, and I wish I could love you the way
  you want, but&mdash;yes, Joan, I know all that by heart now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She flushed and said: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair. After all,
  Bill&rsquo;s my brother and why shouldn&rsquo;t I love him? And I do like you
  better than anyone else. So much so that at times&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped;
  he repeated eagerly:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That at times?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind. Barry, why do you want me? There are plenty of nice
  girls who like just the things you do. I know a dozen who would love
  you&mdash;and any one of them would make you a perfect wife. I don&rsquo;t
  like the &rsquo;things you do. Or if I do, to me they&rsquo;re only brief
  amusements. Why, I&rsquo;d rather help Bill dig up a cup from some ruin that
  spans the gap of knowledge between its maker and us than win a thousand
  sporting trophies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He said: &ldquo;If you loved me that wouldn&rsquo;t make any
  difference.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been brought up differently,
  Barry&mdash;and we&rsquo;re both too set in our ways to change. I am
  anyway....&rdquo; Suddenly she laughed:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you haven&rsquo;t fooled me by this trip, Barry Manson. I know
  damned well that it wasn&rsquo;t any abrupt interest in the Mayans that
  prompted it. I&rsquo;m mighty grateful to you for giving Bill the chance
  he&rsquo;s always wanted. But I wouldn&rsquo;t marry you out of gratitude,
  and I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d want me to&mdash;would you,
  Barry?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His gray eyes narrowed: he said, brutally: &ldquo;Listen, redhead. You
  don&rsquo;t fool me any either. It&rsquo;s damned little of highbrow or
  blue-stocking you&rsquo;d be if you fell in love with a man. Nature
  didn&rsquo;t build you that way. And it would be damned little you&rsquo;d be
  thinking of fossils if that happened. You&rsquo;d be too busy having
  babies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She said, coldly: &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s rather&mdash;beastly!&rdquo;
  He said, hotly: &ldquo;Is that so? What&rsquo;s beastly about babies?
  You&rsquo;d be getting a slant on the present day with some outlook on the
  future&mdash;instead of burying your red head in the past. What I&rsquo;m
  afraid of is that you&rsquo;ll marry some dusty-dry, mummy-minded, scientific
  grave robber and spend the rest of your life nursing fossils instead of what
  you are obviously designed for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She interrupted, furiously, eyes snapping blue sparks:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let nobody pick my husband! Least of
  all&mdash;you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you!&rdquo; Barry&rsquo;s too-quick anger flared.
  &ldquo;It seems to me you were ready enough to pick wives for me just now.
  Not one but a dozen&mdash;&rdquo; He gripped her arms and swung her to him.
  &ldquo;You&mdash;the highbrow scientist? Like hell you are! Look at that mop
  of red hair. Those eyes of yours with the devil&rsquo;s twist to the ends of
  them, that mouth of yours&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve seen you in your rag of a
  bathing suit! I tell you again, by God, that once you&rsquo;re awake
  it&rsquo;s not fossils you&rsquo;ll be thinking of! And maybe this will help
  wake you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He held her close, kissed eyes and throat, pressed his lips to hers. She
  lay in his arms, passive, unresisting. She said at last, indifferently:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cave-man stuff, Barry. Too crude. It doesn&rsquo;t interest me at
  all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He released her, stepping back as though out of a dash of cold water. She
  raised her arms and began to coil her disordered hair. She laughed at him, a
  little too sweetly&mdash;though he did not know it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see, Barry dear, we&rsquo;re as far apart as the poles. You
  make love to me by enumerating my&mdash;ah, charms, is the cliche for it, I
  think. You are an&mdash;ah, anatomical lover. It is a viewpoint, certainly. A
  Sultan&rsquo;s viewpoint, but I do not care for Sultans. Nor,&rdquo; went on
  Joan, still far too sweetly and reasonably, &ldquo;do I think that my
  worthinesses are wholly anatomical. But then&mdash;you&rsquo;ve always been
  rich&mdash;&rdquo;</p><br>
