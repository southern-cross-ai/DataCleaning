<hr>
<p>&quot;I remember when I was in 'Frisco, in 1866, mate o' the old
&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Last time I saw her was in the south-east trades. We were
bound to &mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Forty-five years at sea is about a fair thing for
&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>Such were the snatches of conversation one heard at the unique
gathering of the League of Ancient Mariners, which recently
assembled on board the good ship Commodore on the occasion of what
it was hoped would prove an annual outing. Some forty odd seafarers
accepted the invitation, the great majority of them well on in
years&mdash;grey, grizzled, and white of hair and head; cheeks
tanned by the wind and sea in every quarter of the globe; eyes
still keen and weatherly, and hearts still young with the youth and
vigour of the great ocean they had used so long. Some among them
had turned to dry land for a living, and were now professional men,
men of affairs, prominent citizens brought together by the
fellow-feeling that never dies in the souls of those who have once
known the sea life&mdash;its hardships, its miseries, its
perils&mdash;and its rare pleasures.</p>
<p>Others there were present still connected with salt water in
some fashion or other; but for the most part the &quot;Ancient
Mariners&quot; had ceased from earning a livelihood on that
&quot;rolling deep,&quot; a home upon which, as these years close
up in quick succession, when the &quot;grasshopper shall be a
burden,&quot; is not, despite the dictum of all the poets that ever
sung of the sea, one of the most comfortable. There can be no
possible mistake made when addressing anybody on the Commodore;
they are &quot;captains all.&quot; Cheerful and breezy captains,
too; mainly of the old school, men who have served under canvas
long before turning their thoughts to steam, and some who have
never been shipmates with anything in the shape of engines and
propellers. And from more than one quarter is heard a lament that
the days of the speedy clippers are numbered with the past. At
Watson's Bay lunch is served, and a few toasts are
honoured&mdash;&quot;The King,&quot; &quot;Absent Friends,&quot;
&quot;Sweethearts and Wives.&quot; There are, too, a few speeches
made, brief and to the point, each one a capital model for
politicians to emulate in those respects. Captains Green and Pearse
are highly commended for their happy notion in thus making such a
pleasant meeting possible; and then the Commodore, turning on her
tail, steers for the open sea.</p>
<p>It may be pure imagination, but when clear of the Heads, all the
&quot;Ancient Mariners,&quot; appear to gain in vitality and
energy, to walk the deck with a firmer step, to cast a keener eye
to windward, to, in fine, assimilate to themselves some of that
strong and subtle essence of the sea which at one time was their
normal atmosphere. A few of the brethren put out lines, and a few
of them also, to their own patent astonishment, pulled fish up
attached thereto. But their companions for the most part contented
themselves with applauding the successful sportsmen and proffering
advice. Reminiscences, as might be imagined, were plentiful; talk
there was of bygone ships and of the bygone men who sailed them,
the like of whom these latter days never saw, and never would see.
Talk of quick passages, and of abnormally slow ones; of the modern
sailor-man and the passing to extinction of the old-fashioned
type&mdash;every finger a marlinspike, every hair of his head a
ropeyarn, and his blood Stockholm tar. There were men afloat that
day who could, an' they had chosen, have told yarns that would have
made the romances of Russell and of Conrad pale their ineffectual
fires for force and vigour. But they didn't choose, worth
mentioning. Their speech was more inclined towards the eminent
absurdity of carrying lower mast and a topmast in one; of how poor
Jack Webster, master mariner, lost his &quot;ticket&quot; through
no fault of his own, but by the neglect of his second, mate, who
was a worthless Dutchman. Also of (tell it not in Gath) the price
of suburban allotments in various suburbs.</p>
<p>The names of many of these brethren of the deep sea, were they
published, would, without doubt, stir a responsive echo in
thousands of hearts throughout Australia. Prosperous settlers,
merchants, men in every walk of life, would recognise one or other
of the &quot;Ancient Mariners&quot; as the shipmaster, who
commanded the vessel which brought them to the new country, where
they were to make a home for themselves and their children's
children. Among the company on the Commodore were Nestors of the
sea, who had traded to Sydney when it was comparatively only a
small settlement, and when its shipping was altogether
insignificant&mdash;men like those who could tell you what Port
Jackson looked like a good deal over half a century ago. And how,
as they sat and placidly watched the long wash of the Pacific
breakers whitening the bases of the great cliffs of the land which
they had chosen as their resting place&mdash;the land to the
building up of whose present prosperity and welfare they had
contributed in no little measure&mdash;doubtless thoughts of those
rugged and turbulent early days passed athwart their minds.</p>
<p>But the sun is getting low, the most persistent of the
&quot;Ancient Mariners&quot; has lost his line and sinker. Many of
us are not as young as we were, and being &quot;farmers all&quot;
as well as &quot;captains all&quot; it is deemed advisable to steer
for home. The Bay is called at again, en route, another speech or
two made, &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; is sung with an earnest vigour
that leaves nothing to be desired; except, perhaps, a propensity to
scamp the high notes&mdash;and the first gathering of the League of
Ancient Mariners is over until, as Captain Pearse's resolution, put
and carried unanimously, has it, &quot;'the nearest Saturday to St.
Valentine's Day in each year.&quot; And so, home and to rest, for
to many of that goodly company of sea-worn men,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surely, surely, slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore<br>
Than labour in the deep mid-ocean, wind and wave and oar.</p>
</blockquote>
