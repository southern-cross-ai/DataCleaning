  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">No seasoned mountaineer would have tried to cross the
mountain range
  encumbered as John Parks was, and with the cloud streamers blown out stiff
  from the summits and snapping off little fleecy bits which the wind hurried
  across the sky. Even in the lowlands the norther had spread an arctic chill,
  and the bald heights must be insufferably cold. To be sure, the trip would
  have been practicable enough to warmly dressed, active men, but the little
  burro would slow the pace of the journey to a dreary crawl; and, besides,
  there was Tommy to think of. Hardened far beyond city children by his three
  years in the mountains, still at twelve there is a marked limit to a boy's
  endurance. And he was already fagged by the journey, for, though they had
  come only ten miles since morning, it had been bitter work for Tommy up and
  down the. hills, and it might be ten miles more across the summits and down
  to shelter on the farther side.</p>

  <p>John Parks consulted his son.</p>

  <p>"We could camp over yonder, Tommy," he said. "You see that little hollow
  with the pines standing around it?"</p>

  <p>Tommy looked, and his heart went out to the circle among the trees as
  though the night had already closed and the evergreens were full of shine and
  shadow from a fire built in their midst.</p>

  <p>"But," went on John Parks, "it's not far past noon, and just over that
  next crest is the place!"</p>

  <p>And he lifted his gaunt face with that strange smile which Tommy knew so
  well. All his life he had seen his father looking off from the sorrows of
  every day to a bright tomorrow.</p>

  <p>"So what do you think, Tommy?" said John Parks, resting his hand on the
  shoulder of his son. "Do you think we could make it without tiring you
  out?"</p>

  <p>The wind stooped against them and passed an icy thrill through the body of
  the boy, but when he looked up he found the smile still on his father's face
  as though he heard already the far-off murmur of the Turnbull River. What a
  weary way they had come to find that promised land!</p>

  <p>"Oh," he said, "I can make it, Dad. You don't need to worry about me."</p>

  <p>The hand closed on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you're a tough fellow. Tommy," said John Parks. "We'll try it,
  then!"</p>

  <p>They trudged on, the burro grunting and switching its tail before them.
  They climbed two thousand feet in three miles with the trees dwindling and
  dwarfing until they came to a waist-high hedge of lodgepole pine, willow, and
  tough shrubs at timber line, a hedge shaved level across the top by the edge
  of storm winds, running in and out along the mountainsides at one height like
  the verge of green water. Above was the bald region of the summit. The sun
  had melted the surface snow; the wind had frozen it again; and now it blazed
  like glass. That was poor footing for the climb. Even the burro, as it
  pressed out from the thicket, shrank back after trying the glazed surface
  with a tentative hoof. Moreover, the wind now leaped into their faces. It
  flattened the burro's ears and drove his tail straight out. Tommy looked up
  in dismay, but John Parks shook a bony hand above his head.</p>

  <p>"They can't beat us, Tommy!" he shouted. "It takes more than wind and
  weather to beat us!"</p>

  <p>"No, Dad, we'll make it!" Tommy tried to say, but the wind passed his lips
  and blew a stiff pocket in one cheek, so he put down his head and staggered
  on in the lee of John Parks. Then his father took his hand, and with that aid
  he managed to keep steadily at work. When John Parks looked down at him, he
  even managed a pinch-faced smile, but all the time the core of warmth at his
  heart was shrinking, and the numbing cold spread swiftly up to his shoulders,
  then up his legs to the knees, to the hips. He centered all his mind, all his
  will, on every step he made, but oh, the weariness which the cold was
  bringing home to him!</p>

  <p>A fresher blast caught him and wrenched him to the side against John
  Parks.</p>

  <p>"Steady, Tommy!" cried his father. "It's all downhill now. Don't you see?
  We're going to make it easily, boy!"</p>

  <p>It was true, for when Tommy looked ahead there was no longer that soul-
  taking, upward slope. Instead, his eye pitched down past the snowfields to
  the dark streak of timber line, and past timber line to a great, green valley
  with a river running straight as a silver arrow through its heart. That was
  the promised land, then, and yonder was the Turnbull. Here was the place
  where his father's traps every day would take full toll, where the deer came
  up to the edge of the camp fire to watch and wonder, where the cabin was to
  rise, where the ground would be cleared.</p>

  <p>He pushed himself away from John Parks and with a cry made the first step
  down the slope. His legs buckled. Their strength around the knees had turned
  to water, and he pitched down on his face. His heart swelled with grief. Now,
  indeed, he had shamed himself. All the praise for strength and for stolid
  endurance which had been showered on him during the journey was thrown away
  through this hideous weakness. He strove to raise himself, but his elbows
  were like his knees, unstrung and helpless.</p>

  <p>John Parks scooped the small body up and stood with it crushed to him.
  Poor Tommy looked up into a face which was wild with terror.</p>

  <p>"I'm only winded!" he cried faintly. "And I slipped. I can go on now,
  Dad."</p>

  <p>But, while one arm drew him closer to a bony breast, the other was thrown
  to the sky.</p>

  <p>"Heaven forgive me! Heaven help me!" murmured John Parks.</p>

  <p>He lowered Tommy gently to the snow, and there he lay limp. Even the hot
  shame could not nerve him as he watched his father strip off his coat. Tommy
  was raised and wrapped in the garment closely while John Parks cried: "Oh,
  Tommy, hold on - fight hard. I'll be down to the trees in no time. Fight,
  Tommy!"</p>

  <p>The burro was left to follow aimlessly in the rear, shaking his head at
  the wind, while John Parks stumbled and slipped and ran down the slope. Tommy
  tried to protest. He knew well enough that it was dangerous for a man to run
  unprotected into the face of that icy wind, but, when he tried to speak, his
  voice became an unintelligible gibbering. Presently, his mind became as numb
  as his body. Thoughts formed dim as dream figures. It seemed to him sometimes
  that the wind had lifted them and was sweeping them back to the terrible
  summit. Then the gasping voice of John Parks would come to him like a hand
  pushing away clouds of sleep: "Fight, Tommy. Oh, Tommy, keep fighting!" Yet
  the drowsiness increased. He began to wonder why they did not stop, now that
  they had found such a pleasant time for sleeping.</p>

  <p>At length his father was no longer slipping as he ran. The strong, sweet
  breath of evergreens was filling his nostrils, and suddenly he was dropped to
  the ground. The shock recalled him enough to clear his eyes, but it was not
  until John Parks had torn dead branches from the trees, had piled them, had
  kindled them to a flame, that he understood. The first yellow leap of the
  fire told him how near he had been to death, and now he was placed on the
  very verge of the fire while his father, blue faced from the cold, gasping
  and coughing, pummeled his body and rubbed the blood into circulation. In
  half an hour he was tingling painfully in hands and feet. His face was
  swollen with heat. But the danger was gone, and, as if to prove that all was
  well again, the burro stumbled into the clearing and stood with one long ear
  tilted forward to the fire.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">There followed a drowsy time for Tommy. Now and again he
was roused with a
  sudden shuddering to a memory of the labor up the mountainside. But those
  daylight touches of realization were only momentary. On the whole, he was
  lost in warm content by the fire. He roused himself for five minutes to drink
  coffee and eat bacon and flapjacks. But after that he sank back into a
  semi-trance. Afterward, he could remember seeing and wondering at the livid
  face of his father and the great, feverish, bright eyes of John Parks leaning
  over him watching as he fell asleep.</p>

  <p>And in that sleep he was followed by dreams of disaster. He found himself
  again struggling up an endless slope of ice-glazed snow, with the wind
  shrieking into his face and tugging at his body, while his father strode
  before him with long steps, tossing up his arms to the driving clouds and
  laughing like a maniac.</p>

  <p>Once he came dimly half awake and actually heard the voice of John Parks,
  laughing and crying out near him. It seemed odd to him that his father should
  be talking like this in the middle of the night, but sleep had half numbed
  his brain, and he was unconscious again in a moment.</p>

  <p>He only wakened with the sun full in his face and shoved himself up on his
  arms and blinked about him. The nightmare gradually lifted from his brain. He
  was able to see that the little clearing in which the fire had been made the
  night before, the embers of which were still sending up a tiny drift of
  smoke, was fringed with young aspens, now newly leafed with sprays of young
  yellow- green - almost more yellow than green as the sun shone through the
  fresh- sprouting foliage. And yonder was the burro, absurdly nibbling at the
  sprouts on a bush and paying no heed to the rich grass.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dad!" called Tommy, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.</p>

  <p>There was no answer. The silence swept suddenly around him and became an
  awful thing. And, at a little distance, a confused roaring and dashing, which
  had troubled his sleep, he now made out to be the voice of a river. They must
  be close, then, to the bank of the river; it was that famous Turnbull River
  of which they had heard so much. As for the absence of his father, that could
  be explained by the fact that he had gone fishing to take their breakfast out
  of the water.</p>

  <p>So Tommy stood up and stretched himself carefully. To his surprise, there
  was nothing wrong with him, more than a drowsiness and lethargy of the
  muscles, if it might be called that. And, before he had taken half a dozen
  steps about the clearing, that lethargy was departing. The very first glance
  told him that his surmise had been correct. A trail well defined in the
  rain-softened ground led away from the camp in the direction of the
  river.</p>

  <p>He followed the trail easily, but as he went his wonder grew, for the
  signs wandered back and forth drunkenly. And sometimes the steps were short,
  sometimes they were long. Here he had stumbled and lurched sidewise against a
  young sapling, as the damaged branches showed, and a deep footprint at its
  base as well. Tommy paused and drew a breath of dismay. Something was
  decidedly wrong. His father was no expert mountaineer, he knew. When the
  doctor's orders, three years before, had sent poor John Parks in search of
  health in the open country, he had been a great deal of a tenderfoot. And at
  his age it was impossible to learn all that he needed to know about mountain
  life and mountain ways. But to have made this trail required that a man
  should have walked in the darkness, stumbling here and there. And if John
  Parks had walked away from the camp in the darkness -</p>

  <p>Here the mind of Tommy trembled and drew back from the conclusion which
  had jumped upon him full grown. Before his mother's death, he had heard her
  once in a raving delirium. And now, as he thought back to the husky, harsh
  voice of his father which he had heard laughing and talking near by him in
  the darkness, he felt certain that John Parks, also, must have been
  delirious. Yes, that was it, for otherwise men did not waken and laugh so
  wildly in the heart of the night. Why had he not wakened the instant he heard
  that laughter and taken care of the older man?</p>

  <p>Tommy hurried on along the trail. It was more and more sadly evident that
  something was wrong as the trail reeled onward. It reached a grove of close-
  standing, lodgepole pines. Apparently, John Parks had been unable to find his
  way among them. Here and again he had attempted to go through and had
  recoiled after running into a trunk. Finally, he had given up the effort, and
  the trail wound fifty feet to the left.</p>

  <p>By this time Tommy was half blind with fear and bewilderment, and he ran
  on, panting, his feet slipping on the wet grass. Momently, the noise of the
  Turnbull grew louder, and at length he came through a scattered screen of
  trees with the dash of a waterfall making the ground beneath his feet
  tremble. A hundred feet above him, the smooth, green water slid over the edge
  of a cliff, surrounded itself with a lace of white spray as it fell, and then
  the solid column was powdered on the rocks, spread out again in a black,
  swirling pool, and finally emptied into a long, flumelike channel down which
  the current raced like galloping horses.</p>

  <p>And where the bank rose sheer, twenty feet above the edge of that whirling
  pool, the tracks of his father ceased. Tommy, strangled with fear, looked up
  to the pale blue sky above him. By an effort into which all his will was
  thrown he managed to look down again - then fell on his knees moaning.</p>

  <p>To his eyes the whole matter was as clear as though he had read it in the
  pages of a book. Here the ground on the lip of the bank had been gouged away
  by the feet of John Parks as the poor man slipped and fell. Whirling in that
  fall, he had reached out with both hands. There one had slipped on the wet
  grass. There the other of them had caught at a small shrub and torn it out by
  the roots. And finally, there was the place where both hands had taken their
  last hold on the edge of the bank - a hold beneath which the dirt had melted
  away and had let him drop straight to the water below.</p>

  <p>Tommy cleared his dizzy eyes and crept closer. There was no hope that John
  Parks could have lived for a moment in that run of waters. A twig was
  dislodged by Tommy's hand and fell into the stream. It was whirled wildly
  around, danced away from the teeth of jag-toothed rocks, and then darted off
  down the foaming length of the flume. A tree trunk might be ground to powder
  in that shoot of water.</p>

  <p>Tommy drew back from the water. The moment the hank cut away the view of
  the stream, he turned and fled as though the waterfall were a living enemy
  ready to plunge in pursuit with mighty leaps.</p>

  <p>Breathless, he reached the clearing. He ran to the burro, he threw his
  arms around the neck of that scrawny little beast.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Billy," he cried, "Dad is gone - Dad is gone! Dad can never come back
  to me!"</p>

  <p>And "Billy" canted one ear back and one ear forward, as was his way in all
  emergencies calling for thought, and, swinging his head around, he looked
  mildly upon his young master. The next instant he was calmly reaching for
  more buds on the shrub off which he had been feeding.</p>

  <p>Tommy stepped back and watched the burro calmly making a meal, stamping
  now and then to show his content, or flicking his long ears back in gloomy
  anger when he caught sight of the packsaddle near by. And it seemed to Tommy
  Parks that the patient munching of the burro was a symbol of the bland
  indifference of all the world. His father was dead, but here was the wind
  bustling merrily among the twinkling leaves of the aspens, and yonder were
  the white heights over which they had just come, and in the distance was the
  voice of the Turnbull, an ominous, small thunder. His father was dead, but
  all went on as it had gone on before. The very fire which he had lighted
  still sent up a straggling wisp of smoke. And at sight of this, Tommy, who
  had remained dry- eyed, suddenly burst into tears and wept in an agony of
  grief and loneliness and fear.</p>

  <p>The burro wandered over and curiously nudged his shoulder with his
  nose.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">When a man is lost in the woods, the first thing to do is
to sit down and
  have a long think and not wander away in the first direction that comes into
  his head.</p>

  <p>That was what John Parks had cautioned Tommy more than once. He remembered
  it now as he sat cross-legged under a pine, with his back against the trunk.
  He had spent the morning making up the pack - a weird bundle it was when he
  finished - and moving down lower in the valley, farther from the Turnbull, so
  that the sound of its roaring would not haunt him. He had descended simply
  because he dared not undertake, alone, that perilous journey over the
  mountain snows. No, wherever he went, it must be down the valley.</p>

  <p>And he made the first stop at this open place where the lower slope of the
  mountain put out a fist through the shrouding forest - or, rather, it might
  be called a sharp, square shoulder. From the top of it Tommy looked up and
  down the valley across a wilderness of evergreens. The great mountains over
  which they had come were at his back. Beneath him, the Turnbull wound into
  view again, making him shudder as the sun flashed on its windings. And in the
  dim distance were other mountains, a cloudy rolling of blue which separated
  to give place to the Turnbull.</p>

  <p>Through that pass he must go with Billy. It might take weeks to reach the
  gap, and during that time he might find no man to help him on the way. Yes,
  and what lay in blue distance and under the horizon, he could not dream.
  Perhaps there was a desert, burning hot, impassable except to those who knew
  the water holes, deadly even to those, sometimes. He had heard much of such
  places.</p>

  <p>As for the trail over which he had come, if he turned back he would have
  first the terrible heights of the mountains to climb, and then, beyond those,
  there would be the long stretches which he had crossed with his father - and
  it had taken them three days from the nearest town. He might miss the way
  altogether, besides. And it would not be strange if one perished of hunger.
  No, the best way, he decided, was to follow the Turnbull River, even though
  it wandered down through an eternity of distance. For there was a great
  chance that it would lead him to some town.</p>

  <p>Bravely, but not quickly, he made up his mind. That uncertain distance was
  terrible to poor Tommy. For hours he sat there pondering the question back
  and forth, and, when he eventually made up his mind and rose to start on with
  Billy, he suddenly noted that his feet were in shadow. The afternoon had worn
  late, all unawares.</p>

  <p>He wanted to start on at once, for he was in a fever of eagerness to have
  the first stage of the great adventure accomplished and put behind him; but
  he knew that, when one finds a good camping place in the middle of the
  afternoon, it is better to camp at once and make an early start in the
  morning. And nothing could be more ideal than this level hill-shoulder.</p>

  <p>In the dense ranks of the trees which marched up around him, there were
  quantities of dead branches. His keen young eye had noted them automatically
  while he sat there during the afternoon. There were shrubs, too, which he
  could easily cut with his father's sharp ax. Wood, then, which is one of the
  two main essentials for a camp, was there in plenty. As for water, it was
  furnished in equal abundance. A rivulet flowed from the mouth of a cave which
  had doubtless been worn by the working of the water, and the little stream
  wound across the level, then darted with sudden speed to the foot of the hill
  where it joined a large creek, and both went murmuring off to join the more
  distant Turnbull. Perhaps John Parks, if he had seen this place, would have
  decided to start his home on the very spot. With the thought, great tears
  welled into the eyes of Tommy.</p>

  <p>But, according to John Parks, there is a great and universal antidote for
  sorrow - work. Tommy sprang up and set to making camp with a fury. He took
  the pack from the back of Bill - his unpracticed hands had built it so poorly
  that it had twisted awry on the burro's patient back - and then, with Billy
  at work on the grass, the boy hurried to the trees and swung the ax with a
  will.</p>

  <p>It was far too large for him, but practice had taught him to shorten his
  grip on the handle and in that fashion he made fair play with it. Its keen
  edge gave him in five minutes an abundance of wood which kept him busy for
  half an hour longer, dragging it to the center of the opening. But he wanted
  an oversupply of fuel; there could not be too much to furnish him with
  company during the cold, solemn hours of the night.</p>

  <p>The fire itself he made in approved fashion, grouping some big stones
  around it, and here he mixed the cornmeal with soda and water and salt and
  fried his hot cakes and set his bacon sizzling. He made coffee, too, and for
  a while he was so busy that he had no time to give to other worries.</p>

  <p>It was not until he began to eat his supper that grief took him by the
  throat. It seemed to Tommy that John Parks was somewhere down the mountain,
  was coming home with great, impatient strides, and that his well-known
  whistle would surely soon be sounding on the farther side of the clearing.
  Once he found himself breathlessly listening, his eyes strained and wide. He
  rallied from that with a great effort, but, when his glance lowered, it
  struck on the side of the coffee pot, with the graniteware dented where he,
  on a morning, had dropped pot and coffee and all and sent the boiling stuff
  sizzling across his father's shoes. He chuckled softly as he remembered how
  John Parks had danced around on one foot and then on the other. But there had
  been no reproving, no sharp words.</p>

  <p>Tommy buried his face in his hands and sat quivering, full of a grief
  which could not spend itself in tears. Afterward, he could eat no more. He
  could not even look at the tinware and the pots, but, turning his back on the
  camp, he fled uphill and down, fairly running from sorrow. And, in a measure,
  he succeeded, for he came to a panting halt at last with the thick forest
  around him, rapidly darkening with evening, and realized that he must work
  back carefully if he expected to find the camp.</p>

  <p>So that problem filled his mind, and when he reached the camp it was to
  find the fire almost dead. He freshened it, and as he did so he heard, blown
  on the wind from lower down, the valley, a shrill quavering, sobbing voice,
  melancholy as the weeping of a lost child. Tommy listened with a chill
  running up his spine, for well he knew it was a mountain lion hunting up the
  valley, hunting, for the time being, carelessly and well-nigh blindly, since
  he chose to come down the wind instead of against it. And hungered pumas have
  been known to stalk men, if not actually to attack them.</p>

  <p>Tommy, at least, could collect half a hundred memories of stories such as
  men tell around a camp fire when supper is finished and the day's work is
  done and pipes and imaginations are drawing freely. He picked up the rifle,
  saw that it was loaded, and practiced aiming it here and there wherever the
  firelight flashed on a leaf. It was a heavy gun for a child to handle, but
  familiarity with one's tools is half the battle, and for two years now John
  Parks had taken an almost foolish pleasure in teaching his son to shoot with
  that very weapon.</p>

  <p>When Tommy started to work cleaning up the supper dishes, he kept the
  rifle close at hand. Then he built a rousing fire, not of loose brush which
  would toss flames into the sky for a few wild minutes and then burn out, but
  of solid branches which would keep a blaze alive for hours. He even ventured
  into the forest for more wood, but it was only a single expedition, for while
  he worked he felt eyes watching him in the darkness.</p>

  <p>But when he went back to the fire and lay down beside it, twisted in his
  blanket only one side was sheltered by the heat of the fire and the red light
  which all wild beasts are said to dread. The other side lay open to the
  terrible dark and all the powers that prey by night.</p>

  <p>There had been no such fear, no dream of such fear the other nights when
  John Parks was near. The very sound of his voice, so it seemed to the boy,
  would be sufficient to frighten hungered prowlers away. Night had been simple
  and even beautiful before. But now, as he looked up to the huge arch of the
  sky, filled with impersonal eyes, the mountains appearing like piled shadows
  on the one side, it seemed to Tommy that all the vast space in between was
  packed close with enmity and hatred focusing on his single head.</p>

  <p>He got up again, dry of throat, and with his eyes burning from constant
  staring among the trees and the shadows. This time he split the fire into two
  parts, each a solid mass of wood which should burn steadily without
  replenishing until close to daylight, and between the two fires he lay
  down.</p>

  <p>It was very hot there. He folded the blanket and lay on top of it. He even
  opened his shirt so that the air might cool him. But it was better a thousand
  times to lie in heat than in terror.</p>

  <p>That one cry from the mountain lion was all he heard, however, and perhaps
  it had been hurrying across country on a trail well known to it and leading
  to certain prey. That was the reason it had been traveling down the wind
  instead of prowling up it.</p>

  <p>This conclusion came like a blessing and the assurance of peace to Tommy.
  An instant later the stars swam and mingled together in a soft, cool fire
  above his head. He slept.</p>

  <p>It was no nightmare now. Utter weariness of soul and body shut out the
  possibility of dreams. And out of that dreamless, perfect sleep he was
  wakened by a horrible knife-stab of sound - the snarl of a wild beast making
  a kill and biting deep. He stood erect, his heart thundering wildly, his wits
  astray. Then he heard a groan and a fall.</p>

  <p>For the first time he could see. The two fires on which he had counted so
  certainly had burned to smoldering beds of coals, dusted over with ashes
  which alone kept the life from completely dying. And from the beds of coals
  were passed an uncertain glow of light which revealed things not at a glance
  but by dim degrees, just as the mind works out a problem.</p>

  <p>So, what Tommy saw first was a distant, isolated gleam on a polished leaf.
  Next he saw the pack, a jumbled heap without head or tail to it. And last of
  all he saw where Billy lay prostrate, and over the poor burro, with fangs
  sunk in his throat, crouched the mountain lion, a tawny splotch in the
  darkness - though clearly enough visible for Tommy to make out the long sweep
  of the tail as it was lashed from side to side.</p>

  <p>He cried out in an agony of horror and fear, but the small, choked voice
  had the power to make the puma leap growling from its kill and face suddenly
  around. There it saw a man risen from the ground, risen out of the very body
  of detested fires, so it seemed. The mountain lion spat in fear and rage,
  then turned and with uncanny speed slunk away. A single stride, and it seemed
  to melt into nothingness.</p>

  <p>But Tommy dared not move. It was not fear of the lion which kept him
  frozen and still. A danger once confronted and seen naked with the eye
  becomes only a tithe as terrible as when it existed only behind a wall of
  darkness. It was not dread of the lion but consciousness of what the death of
  Billy meant - that he was chained to this place in the valley of the Turnbull
  River. He could not venture farther away than a single day's march from his
  source of supplies, and in this wilderness, how long would it be before men
  came that way?</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">Large meanings sometimes burst upon the brain with one
flash which shows
  all the corners of their significance. So it was with Tommy. In the horror of
  that great knowledge, he forgot fear of the monster which had only now
  crouched in the clearing scarcely more than leaping distance away from him.
  He forgot the death of the poor burro, though the odd ways and the patient
  soul of Billy had made him an old and dear friend. Only one soul-crushing
  thought remained - that he was marooned here in the wilderness as completely
  as though he were his favorite Robinson Crusoe on the island. Rifle,
  ammunition, the bundle of traps, clothing, food - all of these were things
  which he needed to sustain life, and he could not take them with him a single
  step now that Billy was dead.</p>

  <p>But was Billy dead? In an agony of haste, forgetful entirely of all danger
  of the mountain lion which might still be lurking near the edge of the
  clearing, he raced to Billy and dropped to his knees. But Billy was dead. His
  lolling tongue, his torn throat, told plainly that he would never rise again.
  And Tommy sank back on the ground.</p>

  <p>He looked up and saw the cold beginnings of the dawn make the stars fade
  slowly. Still his brain struggled with the future. He was only twelve. If he
  had a rest for a rifle, he could shoot and shoot well; and his three years
  among the mountains had taught him much about them. But, after the ammunition
  was gone, how could he live? And in this wilderness, would the lonely life be
  endurable?</p>

  <p>No tears came. He had been snatched into the heart of a tragedy so swiftly
  that he could not weep. And, after all, tears come more quickly when there is
  a comforter nearby. There in the cold grass he lay, his fists clenched
  tightly, struggling against the problem. It would be easier and less painful
  to go back to that fatal place on the brink of the river and cast himself in.
  But now the light of morning increased rapidly, and to the east he saw the
  first sunlight glisten on the top of a snowy mountain.</p>

  <p>Tommy rose slowly to his feet, and he was no sooner risen than he was
  touched by that spur which, after all, drives men on to most of their
  accomplishments - a stab of hunger. And, an instant later, he was busy
  kindling the fire.</p>

  <p>He had begun to slice bacon, but a moment of reflection made him drop the
  knife. This was food which would keep, and there might well come a time when
  he would need it bitterly. In the meantime, that spring morning held other
  life which must feed him. A tree squirrel chattered overhead and told him
  that he need not hunt far. So he took up the everloaded rifle, dropped upon
  one knee, with his elbow resting on the other, and took careful aim. The
  squirrel promptly ducked around to the farther side of the tree trunk.</p>

  <p>But Tommy knew squirrel nature. The little creatures are invincibly
  curious, and, instead of moving around to the farther side of the tree to get
  in a shot, he watched the same opening among the branches. Presently, as he
  had expected, the tiny head slipped into view, and that instant his finger
  closed on the trigger.</p>

  <p>He did not miss. When one has a limited supply of ammunition, one dares
  not miss. The ring of the shot was still in his ears when he heard the little
  body come rustling through the foliage and drop with a light thud to the
  ground. He took it up quickly with a strangely savage thrill of satisfaction.
  Was not all the world now banded against him? John Parks had stood between
  him and the outside, and now he was stripped naked of help. Every tooth and
  claw hidden among those tree-clad valleys and lowlands was against him. And
  he had struck his first blow in self-defense.</p>

  <p>The squirrel he cleaned and broiled for his breakfast. It was a big, fat
  fellow and made enough of a meal, even eaten without bread - for the cornmeal
  was something which he must scrupulously cherish against a time of need.</p>

  <p>And when the meal was ended, his spirits had risen greatly. John Parks,
  after breakfast, had always sat quietly and smoked a pipe while he arranged
  all his plans for the day's work. Tommy imitated that good example by sitting
  up hugging his knees while he surveyed the situation.</p>

  <p>There was one advantage, at least. So long as misfortune had to overtake
  him, it was the greatest blessing that he had been struck here, where the
  cumbrous pack was left in such an ideal camping place. Water, wood, and, best
  of all for a year-round home, a permanent shelter made to his hand, for such
  the cave, from which the little stream ran, seemed to offer. He went
  instantly to explore it.</p>

  <p>It was far better than he had dared to hope. It opened as a roughly
  rectangular gap six or seven feet across and about half that height. But
  almost immediately it expanded to better proportions. It swelled up a dozen
  feet high and twice that broad, and in the dim light Tommy could see the
  glimmer of the stream trailing off into indistinguishable darkness.</p>

  <p>He went back to the embers of his breakfast fire, picked out a length of
  resinous pine wood for a torch, lighted it, and with that yellow sputter of
  flame he advanced again into the cave.</p>

  <p>Now he could make out every detail. It drove back into the heart of the
  mountain nearly a hundred feet, with an arched roof of rock and rough rock
  walls which seemed to promise that there could never be a cave-in. Toward the
  rear, the dimensions of the cave steadily shrank until it ended in a little
  crevice of a hand's breadth, out of which the water poured.</p>

  <p>What could have been more perfect as a natural home? The heart of Tommy
  swelled with the delight of a conqueror. He began to feel that, after all,
  his might not be a losing fight. There would be ways of making the struggle,
  and, though it might be bitter, was it not possible that he might stay on
  there until other men came that way? And surely they must come sooner or
  later, and when they arrived in the valley they must find signs which would
  lead them to his cave.</p>

  <p>That thought inspired him to a new labor. But first of all he moved some
  burning embers of the fire to the front of the cave, and a little to the
  side. That must be his permanent fireplace, and he must never let the fire
  die lest his supply of matches should be exhausted. That could be managed by
  a skillful laying of the fire.</p>

  <p>Next he brought in all the pack, bit by bit, and distributed the articles
  on natural shelves of the rock where moisture would not get at them. When all
  was stowed away, it was a small beginning indeed, and few tools for a
  twelve-year- old child to use in his battle for life.</p>

  <p>There was the body of poor Billy to be disposed of before it should become
  an offense. And the disposal of it offered a problem. He decided that he
  would dig a hole just beside the body, so that Billy would slide into it.
  Then the dead burro could be covered over and the burial properly completed.
  That work could be done with the shovel which had always been a part of John
  Parks' pack. But this could be left until the morrow. Other pressing things
  remained to be accomplished at once.</p>

  <p>First of all, he must not venture out without a weapon. So he tried his
  father's big Colt, in its holster, at his hip - it extended clear to his knee
  - and took the ax. He set out for the river, since it seemed to him that
  travelers would be most apt to come up or down its course, and as he went he
  left a blazed trail on the trees, making the marks so close together that
  they would be sure to catch the eye in a continuous line.</p>

  <p>A full four miles he continued until, leg weary from the walk and arm
  weary from wielding the heavy ax, he came to the edge of the stream. Its
  course was no longer fenced with steep cliffs here, but the water spread out
  over a wide, shallow channel, with broad-topped rocks gleaming just beneath
  the surface. And by the shore he marked half a dozen pools where there must
  surely be excellent fishing. Here he blazed the trees, hewing off big
  sections of the bark and the surface wood to catch the eye of any
  wayfarer.</p>

  <p>After that he rested an hour and started back along his own blazed trail.
  A mile from camp he stumbled across a big mountain grouse. He knocked the
  bird over with a luckily aimed rock and then wrung its neck, and, as he
  marched on again with his dinner in his hand, he found himself whistling. He
  stopped short in wonder at himself.</p>

  <p>But, after all, he told himself, it had not been an unhappy morning. That
  blazed trail was certain to take the eye of some wandering trapper who would
  follow the sign to Tommy's camp, and the stranger would lead him back into
  the world. The new-born hope straightway became a surety. It was a matter of
  only a few days, a few weeks at the most, before he would be discovered.
  Surely he could maintain himself that long!</p>

  <p>Coming onto the clearing again, he was shocked by the sight of the open
  entrance to the cave. He hurried in, but all was as he had left it. No
  prowling beast had taken advantage of his negligence to rob him of his store
  of food. He broiled the grouse and ate, and afterward he set about blocking
  the entrance to the cave.</p>

  <p>It was not hard to do. There was a profusion of big rocks around the
  opening, and these he rolled into the entrance, walling it up solidly. Half a
  dozen stones in the center were of a size which he could easily handle, and
  these could be moved and removed when he returned to camp at the end of a
  day's hunting, or left it in the morning.</p>

  <p>By the time this was accomplished, he was tired, but there remained many a
  stretch of territory which must be explored. So he sallied out with an ax and
  revolver once more and took the opposite direction, going up the slope toward
  the higher mountain.</p>

  <p>There was far less likelihood of men straying through this region, and
  therefore he made his blazes fewer and farther between. In time he came out
  on an open place littered with the rocks of a recent small landslide which
  had scraped down the hillside beyond and sent a wash of boulders and small
  rocks across this comparative level.</p>

  <p>The sight caused Tommy to pause with concern, and he looked back down the
  slope in the direction of his camp. Suppose such a slide as this one should
  start and continue with greater volume down the hill - might he not be buried
  in his cave?</p>

  <p>But he remembered a favorite saying of John Parks: "A man has to take
  chances of one kind or another." And he turned to continue on his way. As he
  did so, however, his eye caught a motion among the rocks. He stopped short
  again, thrilling with fear. Just what had moved, he could not tell. He had a
  general impression, a chance-caught glimpse, rather than a definite picture.
  He jerked out the revolver. It was far too heavy for him, so he dropped down
  on one knee and supported the gun on the other. When in danger of wild
  beasts, he had learned long before, one must stand one's ground, no matter
  with what fear. Man has no speed of foot to escape, and flight simply invites
  pursuit.</p>

  <p>But his heart was hammering at the base of his throat, filling his whole
  body with trembling, when he saw it again - a bit of fur stirring behind a
  rock - the gleam of bright eyes. Suddenly, the whole head of a little bear
  cub no bigger than a rabbit popped into view, surveyed him intently for an
  instant, and disappeared again.</p>

  <p>There is nothing more intriguing than a new-born cub, but Tommy felt no
  pleasure. A youngster of that age must be close to its mother, and mother
  grizzlies are apt to be incarnate fiends if they think that their offspring
  are in danger.</p>

  <p>Where was she now? He recalled a score of stories about the almost human
  intelligence of grizzlies, how they hide their trails when they are hunted,
  how they have been known to double back more than once, and hunt the
  hunter.</p>

  <p>Perhaps this old vixen was engaged in that occupation even now. Perhaps
  she was shielding herself behind one of the boulders just to his rear,
  creeping up silently - very silently - in spite of all her bulk. It seemed to
  Tommy that the air was suddenly rank with the odor of bear. He jerked his
  head around with a low gasp and stared behind him.</p>

  <p>He could see nothing, but at the same time, as though she had seen his
  fear and decided to lurk no longer, the great battle roar of a grizzly
  flooded around him, deafened him, seemed to pour out of the very ground on
  which he stood.</p>

  <p>He leaped to his feet. He would have fled, if he could, but now he could
  not stir a muscle. Still that shambling, monstrous form which he expected did
  not come. The hollow echoes of the roar died off down the hillside,
  shattering to silence among the more distant trees.</p>

  <p>What did it mean? He could not flee, because he might run into the jaws of
  the great brute or within striking distance of a paw whose lightest stroke
  might smash his skull or crush his body.</p>

  <p>Again the roar burst out at him, but this time, plainly, it was on the
  farther side of the rock jumble, pouring out of the earth. A furious
  scratching began at the same time, and a great boulder which leaned against
  the slope quivered out - then fell back with a jar. At the same instant, two
  little grizzly cubs jumped into view among the rocks and scurried as fast as
  their short legs would carry them for the great stone which had just been
  moved. Around the corner of it they darted and disappeared. The roaring and
  the scratching ceased at once, and Tommy understood. The grizzly had been
  blocked in her hole by this monster rock which the landslide had brought
  down.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">In the last few seconds, fear had been so vitally a part of
Tommy that he
  cast it off slowly. He rubbed his faintly corrugated forehead. He dragged in
  great, consciously taken breaths. Finally, he was able to step forward
  without trembling but, at the first sound of his coming, another roar came
  thundering out of the prison of the bear, and again the big boulder shook as
  she threw herself furiously against it.</p>

  <p>The savage threats made him stop short again, but one glance at the
  boulder reassured him. It must have weighed hundreds and hundreds of pounds,
  and, though it was so curiously balanced that the grizzly could thrust it
  back a little and make it shake, she could never really budge it.</p>

  <p>Tommy came to the side of the rock around which the cubs had raced and saw
  that there was actually an opening a foot and a few inches across, covered
  with the scratches of the great brute where she had vainly tried to claw out
  a wider opening.</p>

  <p>Her roar had fallen to an ominous growling now, but Tommy, knowing that he
  was safe, went close and dropped upon his hands and knees to look in. A bears
  cave is rarely very large, but this one had been made to order for bruin - a
  shallow place hollowed out of the living rock of the hill. Also, it faced
  south away from the prevailing winds, which is perfectly in accord with a
  bears fancy. And the heavy snows of midwinter must have covered the mouth of
  the cave and given all the necessary warmth. Besides, she had dragged up some
  brush to close the mouth of the cave.</p>

  <p>In a moment, the eyes of Tommy were accustomed to the shadow, and he saw
  all clearly. There lay the great brute, with the hair worn from hips and
  flanks. Hair was worn around her shoulders and neck, also, where she had
  attempted to thrust herself out past the boulder, and there was fresh blood
  from her attempt of only the moment before. He saw her paws and marked that
  the claws were broken short or worn away by her efforts to dig through the
  rock. And her desperate, reddened eyes glared out at him.</p>

  <p>As for the cubs, they had regained courage as soon as they returned to the
  neighborhood of their mother. They began to steal toward the opening from the
  little cave in order to examine the stranger more carefully, but the mother,
  with a deep growl, scooped them back with the flip of a forepaw and with a
  violence that rolled them head over heels. They arose, shaking their heads,
  whined a little, and then sat up on their haunches, their little forepaws
  dangling, their sharp ears pricked, and stared at Tommy with insatiable
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>And how his heart went out to them! Bear cubs could be tamed, he knew. He
  had actually seen a burly yearling chained in the yard of a mountain rancher.
  And he had heard old trappers tell tales of Adams, king of bear tamers, who
  had reared bears that fought for him against their own kind and served him as
  pack animals - even as hunting dogs! And if he had those bright-eyed little
  fellows in the cavern yonder, what companions they would be!</p>

  <p>He sat down with a sigh, cross-legged, and watched them and wondered,
  while the wise old bear rested her great head on the bruised, bleeding paws
  and studied him in a reserved silence, as though she realized she had less to
  fear from this man cub than from terrible man himself.</p>

  <p>It would be easy enough. Tommy decided, to lie in wait and capture the
  little cubs when they ventured out, but if he had them in the cave there
  would be nothing to feed them. That thick layer of fat which a bear
  accumulates to sustain it during the hibernation months still left the old
  mother enough strength to suckle her cubs and sustain herself, and it might
  be many days before she began to starve. Eventually, however, unless she were
  freed to forage for herself, she must die, and the cubs must die with her for
  the lack of milk.</p>

  <p>All of this Tommy knew, and the problem weighed heavily upon him. How
  could his strength avail to move that rock or to widen the opening? And, even
  if he succeeded, would he not be opening a way so that the great brute might
  rush out and tear him to pieces?</p>

  <p>Still, tentatively, he struck the boulder with the back of the ax. It
  brought a stunning roar from the old grizzly, so that Tommy involuntarily
  shrank back; but also he noted that a flake of rock had loosened and fallen
  under the blow. Tommy studied the monster rock curiously. It was hard as
  flint in seeming and in fact, but it was so very hard that it was brittle.
  Its surface had easily defied the tearing claws of the bear, but it proved
  friable under the stroke of something harder than itself. In fact, as he
  studied it more closely, he saw that its base, where it had struck other
  rocks after the fall down the mountain, was powdered to dust.</p>

  <p>He tried it again, and with a harder blow, and this time a larger chip was
  loosened under the impact of the steel. The mother grizzly advanced furiously
  to the mouth of her choked cave and reached out a long forearm toward him
  with another roar, but she retreated almost at once and lay crowded back so
  far as possible in her cave. And Tommy commenced his work seriously.</p>

  <p>It was slow progress that he made, at the best, for there must be a huge
  portion of the rock worn away before the great body of the bear could issue,
  and all he could do with the heaviest blow was to knock off a thin layer, bit
  by bit.</p>

  <p>There was no roaring from the grizzly now. With her ears sharpened, her
  head raised, she watched his movements as eagerly as though their
  significance had finally dawned on her, and Tommy at length ventured to carry
  his work to the very edge of the aperture which opened between the rock of
  the boulder and the rock of the mountainside. Now if she could understand at
  all with her brute intelligence, she would appreciate what he was trying to
  do, for every flake of stone which he loosened was perceptibly widening the
  orifice.</p>

  <p>When his arms were wearied by the hammering, he scraped the rock fragments
  away and stood up to stretch the kinks from his back and legs. And as he
  stood away, the mother lunged forward and sniffed curiously at the place
  where he had been working. Still she cuffed the cubs into a corner when they
  attempted to investigate for themselves, but her own fears had so far relaxed
  that she lowered her burly head to her paws and watched and watched with the
  reddened little eyes.</p>

  <p>Tommy worked until his aching shoulders stopped him, and by that time the
  shadows were beginning to slope far east among the trees, so he took his last
  look at the bear family and bade them goodnight. A boy cannot do without
  names. He had christened the fatter of the cubs "Jack" and the slenderer one
  "Jerry," so he called their new names to them and then picked up his ax and
  turned homeward.</p>

  <p>Dusk began to gather as he walked, but still there was enough light for
  him to see and kill another grouse. It was between sunset and dark when he
  reached the camp with his prize.</p>

  <p>Others had been there before him. There would be no need of burial for the
  body of poor Billy. A scattering of bones was all that was left of him, and
  Tommy, shuddering, searched the ground and found the trails of great-footed
  timber wolves and small-toed coyotes. These had devoured the burro, and, led
  doubtless by their insatiable appetites, they had come to the mouth of his
  cave and had even succeeded in scratching away half a dozen of the smaller
  stones.</p>

  <p>They had been able to make no entrance, however, and Tommy felt a thrill
  of pride in his work of fortification. Utter fatigue, however, buried all
  sense of satisfaction. He could barely keep awake while he half cooked his
  dinner, and half an hour later, with the fire smoldering just outside the
  cave and his blankets laid down within its mouth, he was sound asleep, to
  dream of weird monsters locked in caves from which he liberated them, only to
  have them fly at his throat. And he did not waken until the sun was over the
  eastern mountains.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">He rose like a conqueror, for had he not faced hard
fortune, and in so
  short a space made a home, killed his own food, and cooked it? If there were
  sorrow just behind him, and unknown terrors in the future, he kept away from
  all thought of these things by centering his mind resolutely on what lay
  immediately before him. The first thing, even before breakfast, was to bury
  the bones of poor Billy. He shoveled a hole in the soft dirt, and in half an
  hour all that was mortal of the burro lay under ground, with a litter of
  heavy rocks above it to keep out curious wolves.</p>

  <p>Then he cut a slender sapling, straight as a rule and willowy in
  suppleness. To the end he tied the fishing line and hook. On the bank of the
  little stream which worked around the foot of his hill, he found bait in
  plenty at the first turn of his shovel, and soon he had jerked three big
  trout from the water.</p>

  <p>That made a delicious breakfast, toasted brown over wood coals as he had
  been taught to do by John Parks. And after he had eaten he stood up and
  stretched his arms, filled with a sense of joyful power. How painfully small
  and weak he was, matched with those enormous mountains, those huge, dark
  woods! And yet he had won a livelihood from them these few days; he would
  keep on winning it until his blazed trails led a rescuer to his camp.</p>

  <p>But, if he wakened hungry from the fasting of a single morning, what must
  be the case of the poor mother bear? He knew that after hibernation a grizzly
  eats little during the first week, but it might be many and many a day since
  the big bear had wakened from her season of sleep. She must be wild with
  famine and with thirst, he thought.</p>

  <p>Close to the cave of bruin, the day before, he had heard the voice of a
  brook and even had seen the waters pooled in a little lake which promised to
  be brimful of fish. So he took with him for the day's expedition the fishing
  line and rod, his father's four-pound hammer, which was one of the most
  valued articles in the pack, the revolver tied on his hip, and a square of
  the tarpaulin on which their blankets had been laid. And so off he went
  through the woods, with his whistle running thrilling before him.</p>

  <p>But no one can whistle long through the solemnity of virgin forest. The
  music died away, and Tommy went on silent and serious among the great trees.
  Now that he was left lonely in the wilderness, it took on a different face
  and spirit in his eyes. The shadowed places were full of a solemn
  interest.</p>

  <p>The huge trunks were full of signs to him. Every tree carried a character
  of its own. And every rustling breeze seemed to hold a message for Tommy, if
  he could only have understood the sighing voices. Instinctively, he walked
  softly, letting the toe strike first, and avoiding all twigs which might make
  a crackling under foot. And now and again he paused, near a tree, and
  reconnoitered the forest ahead and behind. It seemed to him that the moving
  shadows must be cast by living beasts of prey, which stalked him. No matter
  if reason told him that they were not apt to rove abroad except during the
  evening and the night, still he was troubled, and he took care not to walk
  along the trail which he had followed the day before.</p>

  <p>He reached the clearing with its litter of stones and fallen boulders, and
  as he stepped out from behind the trees he discovered that even his silent
  coming had not been silent enough, for there were the two little balls of
  fur, Jack and Jerry, scurrying as hard as they could for the shelter of the
  mother's cover. Their hair-trigger senses had warned them of his approach.
  When he stepped toward the cave, he was greeted with the same tremendous roar
  from bruin.</p>

  <p>In spite of all he knew about her helplessness, that bellow of rage
  stopped him short and lifted the hair on his head with a prickling fear. But
  he went on again, reassured, and leaned over to look inside. At sight of him,
  it was apparent that the mother recognized her visitor of the day before, for
  she dropped down to the ground and laid her head on the forepaws once more,
  watching him with unblinking eyes. And yonder were little Jack and Jerry
  standing up as gravely as any grown men could have done, with their forepaws
  folded across their chests and their sharp eyes twinkling out at him through
  the shadows. It was a thrilling sight to Tommy. His heart went out to them
  strangely, and he turned and hurried away toward the creek.</p>

  <p>It was even better stocked than he had dared to hope. The first worm that
  wriggled on his hook had hardly touched the surface of the water when it was
  seized, and he snatched out a silver-flashing four-pounder. The little pond
  fairly swarmed with hungry life. In five minutes he had brought a dozen
  prizes to the shore. They lay flopping and quivering all around his feet, and
  Tommy laughed with the joy of the sport.</p>

  <p>He had to make two trips with fish in his tarpaulin before he had brought
  all the prizes to the vicinity of the cave. And on the second trip he found
  that mother bruin was standing up, her head wedged against the opening of the
  cave. She had smelled the fish, and she was wild with hunger indeed!</p>

  <p>Yet when Tommy came near with a fish in his hands, she promptly drew back
  so far as the meager limits of the cave would permit, and when he threw in
  the fish she allowed it to flop within an inch of her nose without stirring
  to devour it. But there was a convulsive twitching of her nostrils, and Tommy
  knew that it had been eloquent to the scent of the great brute.</p>

  <p>He tossed in another. And now she shoved her head forward, smelled the
  first fish, smelled the second - even allowed Jack and Jerry to scramble up
  and do as she was doing. They sniffed the fish from head to tail and then
  stood up and eyed their mother, plainly asking her what was to be done with
  these cold things whose odor was so delicious. Tommy threw in a third of his
  spoils, and now, as though the number of them assured her that they were
  untainted, the mother began to eat. Half a dozen went down her gullet as fast
  as Tommy could throw them in, and he laughed with pleasure at the sight of
  her evident satisfaction. But the seventh fish she cut in two and ate only
  half, and the eighth she did not touch. Plainly, her stomach, still shrunk by
  the winter's fast, would not permit her to eat more. But Tommy threw in all
  the rest and then went down to the creek and returned with a gallon of water
  in the tarpaulin. He poured it into a hollow of the rock near the mouth of
  the cave and watched her lap it up - but only a few swallows was all she
  wanted. The rest she allowed Jack and Jerry to come and wallow in, sniffing
  it with their keen noses and then cuffing it tentatively with their paws,
  until finally they were tumbling and scuffling in the midst of it.</p>

  <p>It was too great a temptation to Tommy. Little Jack stood nearest him with
  back turned, and with a quick reach and snatch Tommy caught the cub behind
  the neck and jerked it out.</p>

  <p>It was the signal for pandemonium to break loose. The frantic mother came
  to life with a rush that brought her crashing against the opening. And the
  poised boulder quivered - then sank back into place. In the meantime, her
  roar was threatening to burst the ears of Tommy, while at the same time his
  hands were unbelievably busy with Jack.</p>

  <p>The little bear was armed with tiny claws, sharp as the claws of a cat,
  well- nigh, and with needlelike teeth. And instinct or scufflings with his
  brother seemed to have taught him how to use both weapons with professional
  skill. In ten seconds, blood stood out on a dozen little scratches on Tommy
  before he had young Master Bruin secured with a firm grip behind the ears, as
  a cat may be held. Then, realizing that to battle was vain, he struggled to
  get back to his mother, whining piteously.</p>

  <p>But Tommy held his grip. The wild roar of the mother had subsided to a
  terrible growling, while, thrust forward so far as she could come, she
  watched every movement of Tommy with a grim anxiety. In the meantime, he was
  careful to remain where she could see his every movement. He began speaking
  in a low, gentle voice, as soon as he could make himself heard, and stroking
  the soft fur.</p>

  <p>The whining of Jack fell away to a subdued moan of terror. And at the same
  instant the uproar of the mother ceased entirely. It was as though she did
  not wish to make a noise which might take up some of her faculties and
  prevent her from noticing every touch of the boy as he handled her precious
  son. And finally she silenced Jerry, who was squealing still with a piercing
  insistence, with one of those flips of a forepaw which sent him tumbling and
  threatening to break every bone in his body.</p>

  <p>But he rose, as always, in perfect unconcern, carefully wiped the dirt
  from his bruised nose with his paw, and sat up to watch the progress of
  affairs with greater care. That cuff had silenced Jack, as well. He no longer
  even struggled, but cowered down under the caresses of Tommy's hand.</p>

  <p>He seemed to find a pleasure in the stroking, too. And finally he turned
  his head and dared to look his captor straight in the face. It was only an
  instant that he met those strange, human eyes at such terribly close range.
  Then he jerked his head away. But the quiet, happy voice of Tommy, thrilled
  and delighted by his conquest, gave Jack new courage. He looked again.</p>

  <p>And there was no cuff to reprove him. The gentle stroking continued. The
  quiet, human voice which sent such mysterious currents of electric surprise
  and pleasure through the heart of Jack went on. Finally, Jack ventured
  closer. He stood up on the leg of Tommy. He actually sniffed at the face of
  this harmless stranger who had such delightful powers.</p>

  <p>And the heart of Tommy leaped. He had not known until now how desperately
  empty his spirit had been, how completely full of loneliness he had been, but
  the sniffing of the trustful, curious little cub at his face brought the
  tears of happiness to his eyes.</p>

  <p>He took the cub as before and ventured toward the mouth of the cave. The
  mother growled softly, and the ears of Jack flattened as he heard the voice.
  He was placed on the ground, and he crawled toward Mother Bruin as though he
  felt that he had been playing the errant against orders and must be punished
  for his transgressions. But the grizzly was only too happy to have him back.
  She licked and sniffed every inch of him and then retreated with a growl of
  satisfaction to the rear of the cave, where she lay down as before to watch
  for the development of events.</p>

  <p>It was all most mysterious to her. She had been taught by mother nature
  that all beasts take and hold only to destroy. But here was her helpless
  offspring taken away and then restored to her safe and sound. Moreover, it
  had been taken by man, and she had learned from the wise mother before her
  that man is the one thing to be dreaded in all the range of the mountains.
  Nothing else could harm her. The stoutest mountain lion fled from its kill at
  her approach. All wild brutes trembled before her. But man, she had been
  taught, sees from afar and kills from afar - an inescapable death. Not in
  vain had she had her encounters with three separate packs of dogs with which
  she had been hunted, and, though she had escaped each time by miracles of
  cunning and endurance, she carried the scars of five bullets on her big body,
  and the bullets themselves in her flesh.</p>

  <p>But if she had been taught some lessons by pain, she could learn still
  other lessons through the kindness of the new teacher. Bear and dog come from
  a common ancestor, and both have the power to understand the ways of man.
  Though she dreaded Tommy still because of the man scent which was so
  abhorrent to her, yet she was beginning to feel that,, just as he was smaller
  than those other men who had trailed her, so was he gentler, also. And who
  could tell? If the others had had strength to destroy, he might have equal
  strength to preserve.</p>

  <p>At least she would wait and watch, and watch she did, with her great head
  tilted cannily to the side, wonderfully like a dog, while Tommy took up his
  four-pound hammer and renewed the attack on the rock which fenced her
in.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">He made wonderfully good progress with the hammer. The ax
had been a
  clumsy tool for the work of the day before, but the shorter handle of the
  hammer gave Tommy a better chance. It was a heavy tool, to be sure; and,
  though he stood with braced legs and swung the hammer with a regular rhythm,
  yet his shoulders and back were aching before he had been at it long. But the
  rock was falling away in great and greater flakes. And now the entrance hole
  was perceptibly widened.</p>

  <p>When he retired to scrape away the fragments, the mother bear came again
  to the opening, and now all of her broad head could pass through. She whined
  up to Tommy with understanding as he approached again.</p>

  <p>And when he sat down at the entrance and held out his hand, she did not at
  once cuff Jack away as the curious little cub started slowly to investigate
  the meaning of that inviting hand.</p>

  <p>She allowed him, the first time, to come within a few inches of the hand,
  sniffing eagerly, before she knocked him away with a growl which warned him
  to stay out of danger and let well enough alone. But, when Tommy persisted in
  staying there, she merely pricked her ears the second time and watched
  without interference.</p>

  <p>For curiosity in a bear is almost as great as its fear of death. The
  strange sight of a forest fire had once held her fascinated until a far-flung
  arm of the conflagration cut in behind her and nearly blocked her retreat.
  She had retired with a scorched hide and a deeper respect for the great red
  enemy, but forest fires remained as interesting as ever to her. And now much
  as she dreaded that small human in the mouth of the cave, she was devoured
  with insatiable curiosity as to what he would do if his hand touched her cub
  again. Once before she had seen Jack handled, and yet he had come back to
  her, rank with the man taint, to be sure, but safe and sound in body and
  limb. Might it not happen again?</p>

  <p>It did happen! Little Jack came to the fingertips, sniffed them, ventured
  closer, shrank from the hand which attempted, to caress him, and then came
  back and allowed the fingers to rub his head. He went farther out. With a
  faint growl of anxiety, she saw him taken up. But then there happened what
  had happened before. He was soothed by a gentle voice. He was stroked and
  rubbed to his heart's content. Even when those sharp little teeth of his
  closed on the hand of the boy, even though that bite brought a small drop of
  crimson to the surface of the skin, he went unpunished.</p>

  <p>To be sure, when Jerry attempted to follow Jack, mother grizzly decided
  that one risk was enough at a time, and he was warned cowering back by a
  terrific snarl. But when Jack was returned to her a moment later, her
  examination of him was most cursory. At a glance, at a sniff, she knew that
  all was well with him still.</p>

  <p>The work at widening the hole continued, now, and Tommy made the chips of
  rock fly. But when the afternoon grew late and the spring sun sloped into the
  far west, he threw down the hammer with a great sigh and rubbed his aching
  shoulders as he contemplated what still remained to be done. And it meant
  days and days of this labor - and his hands were already blistered with what
  he had done!</p>

  <p>And yet what a wonderful thing it was, thought Tommy as he started home
  that evening, that it could lie within the power of his small hands not only
  to support his own life in the wilderness, but to save the lives of three
  other creatures? And the sense of labor accomplished and other labor to be
  done toward the good end filled him with a solid self-respect which was new
  to him. He felt these things; reason was not yet developed in him to the
  extent of allowing him to be mentally conscious of them.</p>

  <p>Once more he was too tired to keep his eyes open for long after he had
  eaten his supper, but as his eyes closed in profound slumber a new thought
  came to him. In the morning he would take all that he needed with him, block
  the mouth of his big cave with more and heavier rocks, and move to stay by
  the bear cave until the work of liberation was completed.</p>

  <p>That promise to himself he kept when the dawn wakened him. How little he
  needed, after all! Salt, a little flour, matches, and the rifle, the hammer,
  and a blanket tied up in the tarpaulin - that was all. As for the other food
  he required, his fishing line would get it for him, and he could supplement
  that excellent fare by knocking over one of the stupid mountain grouse now
  and again.</p>

  <p>Few as the articles were, they made a heavy pack for the legs of a twelve-
  year- old, and he was panting before he reached the bear cave after his
  breakfast. It seemed that his particular scent was now well known, for there
  was no thunderous roar to greet him - only a deep, anxious growl. And the
  little cubs, playing as usual in the clearing among the stones, retreated
  only to the mouth of the cave and there stood up on their hind legs, as bears
  do, to observe him, until they were dragged inside by the paw of bruin.</p>

  <p>But even this anxiety left her later on. She permitted Jack to steal out,
  during one of Tommy's resting periods, while he sat down, always taking care
  to be in view of the mother bear so that she could see all that happened. For
  his great care was to reconcile her to him. As for the cubs, a thousand other
  persons had tamed young bears, but how often had grown grizzlies been made
  into safe companions? So much the greater triumph if he eventually should
  succeed! If a boy of twelve could succeed, surely that would be a proof that
  kindness is a greater weapon than the rifle. He had heard his father say
  that, but at the time he had not been able to understand.</p>

  <p>So he lay on one elbow near the mouth of the cave while Jack stole
  cautiously out to him - followed only by an anxious growl or two, as though
  to warn him that he must be on his good behavior. But Jack observed caution
  only for a moment. He skirmished around Tommy for a little while, and then he
  came straight to close quarters for a better investigation. And there
  followed a wonderful game!</p>

  <p>There were so many possibilities! There were pockets filled with strange
  scents which might be inquired into. There was the strange-smelling leather
  of the shoes, which might be chewed upon. And if one climbed to the shoulder
  of this playmate, his head was crowned by a thatch of hair just like the hair
  of a bear, although not quite so rough, perhaps.</p>

  <p>By this time Jerry had played the part of an idle spectator longer than he
  could endure, and he came out for his share of the fun. Where one had broken
  the ice already, it was not hard for a second to follow suit. In five minutes
  Jerry was every whit as familiar as Jack, while mother bruin contented
  herself with crowding her head out the opening and observing each move.</p>

  <p>With that romp ended, the cubs stayed out to continue a play of their own,
  while Tommy went back to his labors. At noon he went down to the brook and
  caught more fish, some for himself, but more for the grizzly, since she had
  devoured the last of those he had brought her the day before. He fed them to
  her, then brought up water as he had done before and actually ventured a hand
  inside the cave to scrape the dirt out of the hollow of the rock which served
  her as a drinking trough.</p>

  <p>But bruin merely snorted at him and came to smell the rock after he had
  done with it. And when the water was brought, she drank long and deep. After
  that, there were new mysteries into which the cubs were quickly initiated.
  First of all, when Tommy's fire was lighted, they scampered, whining, back to
  the cave; but, after the flames had died down a bit, they were lured by the
  delicious odors of the roasting fish and ventured close again. They not only
  came close, but one at a time they sat up on their haunches and received tiny
  bits of the fish from the tips of Tommy's fingers. And they relished the
  taste!</p>

  <p>Where one thing was good, why might not all be harmless?</p>

  <p>Alas, that it could not prove to be so! Poor Jerry selected for his next
  investigation a little, red hot wood coal and, after a bit of tentative
  sniffing, picked it up boldly in both forepaws.</p>

  <p>There followed a shrill squeal of pain - a roar from mother grizzly - and
  a slight taint of burnt hair in the air. Tommy turned anxiously to watch
  bruin. Would she feel that he had harmed her young ones purposely? By no
  means, apparently. She simply sniffed the burned paws and then promptly
  turned her head away and calmly ate another fish, as though she intended to
  convey that those who would not be warned must take the consequences. But
  that day and the next and the next Jerry went about on his hind legs, or if
  he wanted to run, he had to put all his weight upon the outside rim of his
  forepaws.</p>

  <p>All those days Tommy was working like a Trojan to widen the mouth of the
  cave. A week passed, and he was still at it. And now he could no longer catch
  enough fish to satisfy bruin. In the first place, it was harder to take them
  in the waters of the creek. In the second place, and primarily, the appetite
  of bruin had grown beyond all measure. Both food and water she seemed to
  require in unheard-of quantities. He kept enough of the latter for her in the
  cave, but of the former he could not bring sufficient. And Tommy worked with
  all his might to let her out so she might forage for herself.</p>

  <p>It was terribly slow work, however. The edge of the rock had given way
  rapidly enough, but now, as he came to the body of it, every inch added to
  the gap meant many hours of hammering. There was one great advantage, at
  least. The blisters had dried away, healed, and now his palms were growing
  calloused. And new muscles, too, had grown out on his slender young arms, so
  that the labor of wielding the hammer was far easier. Probably the stalwart
  arms of his father, swinging a sledge, would have battered away the rock in
  great chunks and freed the big bear within a short time. But he, with his
  lesser strength, could only gnaw at the rock-face little by little.</p>

  <p>Ten days of labor passed, and now, half a dozen times a day, bruin came to
  the entrance and strove to squeeze her way out, but the passage was still not
  big enough. And she would retire and lie down to watch and wait, though
  sometimes, as the wind brought to her the delightful fragrance of roots and
  of honey from over the woods, she would raise her big head and growl with
  deep impatience.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, there could be no doubt that even her brute mind
  understood perfectly the service which human hands were performing for her.
  There was not a growl when Tommy came near her. She would come close to the
  entrance to the cave and lie there just out of range of the flying chips and
  observe his work with keen satisfaction. And he, on his side, did all that he
  could to push forward their acquaintance. When he came up with fish, now, she
  would crowd as far out as she could, her little eyes glittering with a
  ferocious hunger - for the appetite of a bear is the appetite of a pig - and
  Tommy would feed her the fish he had captured one by one, from his hands. He
  ventured it first only by holding the fish by the tail and offering the head
  foremost. But he grew bolder day after day. His child's mind, having seen her
  do no wrong, could not conceive her repaying his kindness with beast
  ingratitude.</p>

  <p>So, on a day, half closing his eyes, screwing up all the courage he could
  summon in his shaking body, he held out a small fish on the palm of his hand
  - and mother bear took it away at a bite without touching the skin of his
  fingers! She snorted a little. That was all. And then, as he kept the
  trembling hand extended, she licked the last trace of the fish oil from his
  palm!</p>

  <p>It was almost the greatest event in Tommy's life. For a moment he sat back
  incapable of speech, his heart thundering. But a little doglike whine of
  eagerness from bruin made him continue with the feeding, and from that time
  on every morsel she had was taken neatly from his hand.</p>

  <p>Then - and all was ventured timidly, slowly - he tried to stroke that
  battered head while she ate. It was not easily done. At first, when the
  shadow of the hand extended over her, she winced away with a growl, her upper
  lip twitching back and disclosing huge fangs that could have shorn through
  the flesh and bone of his arm at a single snap. But, with twitching ears and
  quivering snout, she reached out for the fish again and this time allowed his
  hand to touch her head just between the little, pointed ears!</p>

  <p>And that was another great thrill, another great forward step of conquest
  for Tommy. Before the next day came, she was lying contentedly at the gap to
  her cave with Tommy Parks seated beside her - seated in fear, to be sure -
  stroking her great head and rubbing the loose fur, while mother bear seemed
  to take a profound satisfaction in his touch. But what was her pleasure
  compared with the wild delight of Tommy?</p>

  <p>There he sat with two wild grizzly cubs playing on his knees, and with the
  huge head of mother bear dropped to the ground beside him. There he sat
  playing with the cubs, again, while that great head was raised and she
  sniffed at his back - a chill shot up his spine - at his arms and shoulders -
  at his neck - and snuffed strongly on his hair!</p>

  <p>But that was all. No harm was done. Not once was her paw raised or were
  her teeth bared. To be sure, he knew that she had not admitted him to her
  confidence as the little cubs so freely admitted him, but she took him as a
  friend, an unmistakable ally, but for whose providence she must have starved
  and died there. And that, for the time being, was enough for
Tommy.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">What that two weeks of labor meant for Tommy, no one could
have told - he,
  least of all. But for two mortal weeks he was so enthralled in body and
  spirit that he hardly had time to think back to the father he had lost, or to
  the strange and gloomy future. Or, if sorrow for the dead John Parks, or the
  dread of what was to come, now and then darted through his mind with a pang,
  the pain was short-lived. Weariness leaves not much room in the spirit for
  anything but itself and the longing for sleep - and a weary boy he was long
  before the closing of every day. And if he were not weary, he was in the
  thick of his work or resting momentarily from it or sitting soberly beside
  the scarred head of mother bruin or romping wildly with the cubs.</p>

  <p>They had grown prodigiously during the two weeks. One could hardly
  recognize in them the soft little balls of fur which Tommy had first seen.
  They had grown, indeed, like their mother's appetite, and that was the
  despair of the boy. They skirted here and there all around the clearing. A
  thousand things came to their senses - things which remained invisible to
  Tommy.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, he would see them, of one accord, start digging the soft dirt
  where there was nothing on the surface, and presently they would be snuffing
  in the dirt like little pigs, and champing at white, soft roots. The
  strangely sensitive noses had told them that the roots were there, perhaps,
  and century- old instincts which needed no supplementary instructions told
  them that the roots, once found, would be good to the taste. Not that they
  actually ate any quantity of them. Mother's milk was their food, and would be
  for weeks and weeks to come, but they loved the taste of things, of nearly
  all things, so it seemed. They would chew grass or bark with avidity and
  eject it with equal disgust. An end of Tommy's coat was a morsel to be
  tested, at the least, as poor Tommy learned to his despair. They scratched at
  the bag which held his small and dwindling supply of com meal. And they
  persisted in coming after him and digging up the grains of corn which Tommy
  found in a separate bag and bethought himself to plant.</p>

  <p>Finally, in despair, he had taken all that remained of that precious seed
  and carried it back to his own home grounds. There, along the banks of the
  little rivulet that flowed across his plateau, he planted the corn, with high
  hopes for what it might bring forth for him in the autumn.</p>

  <p>But even his home place was not secure from these ready prowlers. They
  loved Tommy with a perfect and beautiful love. When he was absent, they
  wailed for him in unison. And, when he took his daily trips back to the home
  cave to see that all was well, to replace whatever stones had been scratched
  from the entrance by some prowler, or to open the cave and examine the
  condition of his total worldly possessions, the cubs formed the habit of
  following him some distance down the way.</p>

  <p>At first they would turn and scamper back to the mother as soon as the
  distance made them uncomfortable or the tall woods oppressed them, or, most
  of all, the sullen commands of bruin herself overawed them. But every day
  they went a little farther until they reached a point when they were more
  afraid of going back alone than of going ahead into unexplored country with
  Tommy. And so it was, to his unspeakable delight, that they one day went with
  him clear to the home cave.</p>

  <p>They began to grow homesick and hungry at once, and they whimpered most of
  the way back to their mother; but, having followed him once, they could not
  resist the lure each succeeding day. They returned always to take a severe
  cuffing and scolding from bruin, but what little bear can remember a beating
  from one day to the next? Jack and Jerry certainly could not!</p>

  <p>Bruin was wildly jealous at first, but her jealousy diminished. If Jack
  and Jerry depended upon the boy for fun and romping which she could not give
  them, she depended upon him for the very food which sustained her life, and,
  though her appetite was even more rapidly outgrowing his ability to supply
  her with provisions, a small oasis is better than a complete desert.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the time of liberation was approaching. Little by little the
  solid rock had been eaten away by the hammering. Perhaps it was because he
  had gained strength from practice; perhaps it was because he had studied out
  little systems of attack; but it seemed to Tommy that the rock began to grow
  softer and to break away more and more readily until, finally, every stroke
  gave him a chip.</p>

  <p>Yet he still thought that the hole must be far too small when, one morning
  after he had done a scant hour's work, bruin approached the gap and
  deliberately thrust herself through up to the shoulders. There she stuck,
  and, when she drew back, growling, Tommy attacked the rock with a freshened
  hope. He knelt in the entrance itself. He shortened his hold on the hammer,
  and the rock fell before him in chunks. Some of those fragments landed with
  cruel force on the, head and body of bruin, but she refused to move back.
  With a fascinated interest she watched and held up a great paw to shield her
  face from the flying fragments, just as a man will shelter his eyes against
  the glare of sunlight.</p>

  <p>Tommy laughed at her as he worked, and he worked until his trembling arms
  could not lift the hammer again. Then he stepped back. He was weak all over
  from the exertion. His head swam, his legs sagged beneath him; it seemed that
  surely he could never again attack that stubborn rock. Bruin, in the
  meantime, stepped to the gap, sniffed at the place where he had recently been
  hammering, with her head cocked wisely to one side, and then deliberately
  wedged into the gap.</p>

  <p>And at the first effort her shoulders came clear through!</p>

  <p>The head of Tommy cleared instantly. He forgot his weakness. Bruin,
  grunting with satisfaction, lunged forward again, and suddenly she was in the
  open, her sides scratched and bleeding, to be sure, by the sharp projections
  of the rock. But what did that matter, compared with the freedom she had
  gained?</p>

  <p>Jack and Jerry, too, seemed to realize how great this moment was. They
  galloped before her and stood up and cuffed at her face with their little
  paws. But the grizzly, with a grunt and a growl, turned about and confronted
  Tommy. All the friendliness which she seemed to have felt for him while she
  was hopelessly imprisoned now vanished, apparently. Tommy, with a beating
  heart, stepped forward with extended hand, speaking softly. But she stopped
  him with a warning snarl, a terrible, indrawn breath, showing those great,
  yellow fangs as she did so.</p>

  <p>The next instant she had wheeled and was ambling swiftly away toward the
  familiar shadows of the woods. Jack and Jerry scampered in her rear. In
  another moment she was lost in the undergrowth. The cubs turned and whined at
  Tommy as though bidding him follow, also; but a deep-throated growl from the
  front made them turn about and scurry away. In scarcely a minute from the
  instant of her liberation she was gone, and Tommy stood still and listened to
  the diminishing crackling of the twigs. He stood still, and the tears
  trickled slowly down his face; for, after all, he was only twelve, and this
  desertion was more than he could stand.</p>

  <p>The keen, steady heat of the sun burning through the shoulders of his
  shirt roused him at last. Labor had swollen his hands with blood. Long labor
  had weakened them. It seemed to Tommy that he had barely the strength to
  gather up his belongings and make his pack again. And when he had started on
  the back trail toward his cave, he was so weak that he had to sit down for a
  rest every two or three hundred yards.</p>

  <p>It was a melancholy march, indeed, that trip back to the camp. He felt in
  a single rush the reflex of the excitement which had been supporting him for
  the past two weeks. The old sorrow, the old fear which had been lurking in
  the back of his brain all that time, now stepped out and took possession of
  him. And again and again the emotion of self-pity came so stingingly upon him
  that the tears welled up into his eyes.</p>

  <p>He fought them away, at last. He forced himself to raise his head and to
  step on more lightly, for if he gave way completely to the weakness, he felt
  that it would overwhelm him in a wave of unbearable strength. But how changed
  everything was! All these days he had been walking gaily back and forth along
  this trail. He had come to know each runlet that crossed the way, each
  clearing, each denser growth of trees. All had become familiar and kind to
  him by constant seeing, but now the familiarity was gone. The trees wore
  altered faces. The wind swept through the treetops with an ominous
  strength.</p>

  <p>A chilling thought possessed him. He had been so confident that his blazed
  trails would soon lead a trapper or traveler to him, and full two weeks had
  passed without a sign of a deliverer. Might not the entire summer and autumn
  pass in just that manner? And, in such case, what would he do when the bleak
  winter dropped upon this country, when the snow fell many feet in depth, and
  when the cruel northers howled around the peaks and cuffed the forest until
  it groaned? How strongly that wind blew, he could see evidenced on every
  hand. Yonder was a tree with a broken top. And here was a mighty pine knocked
  over simply because it had stood by itself in an exposed place. How dark and
  cold and cheerless the cave would be through that long, winter season!</p>

  <p>The heart of Tommy was failing him completely, and, as always when he was
  sad, the picture of his dead father grew up in his mind as vividly as if John
  Parks were walking just behind him - as if at any moment he would hear the
  familiar voice, feel the hand dropped upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>And he built strange fancies, kind and cruel at once. He imagined John
  Parks returning, weak and pale, with a tale of how he had been carried down
  the current, battered and torn by the sharp rocks, but how he had managed to
  reach the bank; how he had lain delirious and sick for days; how he had
  managed to kill a grouse, perhaps, and so obtain food. And so, at last, he
  was come back to Tommy. All the horror was simply a great, gloomy
  adventure.</p>

  <p>Such thoughts came to Tommy as he walked home this day. And before he
  reached the clearing there was established in his mind an undying hope that
  once again, before the end, he would find John Parks.</p>

  <p>The minds of children move strangely. Delicate, small things which quite
  escape the attention of their elders, to them are all in all. A tree in the
  dark of night may seem to them ominous as the villain of the play; a smile
  may shock them through and through with happiness; and a frown may lock up a
  lasting sorrow in their hearts. However cruelly casual they may be
  themselves, they are keenly aware of all the moods of others. And to poor
  Tommy, lost in that wilderness, every mountain head that reared above the
  Turnbull valley was as dreadful as a threatening man about to descend upon
  him, or holding a threat of perpetual danger above his head. So he took this
  weird hope for the return of his father into his inmost soul, and it cheered
  him wonderfully. It was like the flame of a match cherished painfully in a
  wind - the last match of a store, lighted precariously. So it was that he
  kept that thought of his father apart in a quiet place of his mind, to be
  turned to in moments of dread and sorrow.</p>

  <p>All was well in the clearing. Other prowling beasts of prey had been
  there, to be sure, drawn by the odor of the strong bacon, perhaps, or lured
  by the man smell where there was no man. The rocks at the entrance to the
  cave had been partially scratched away. But no harm was done.</p>

  <p>Tommy removed the stones and found all well inside the cave. And that
  night he had not the courage to go abroad foraging for food. He let the very
  squirrels chatter unheeded in the trees above his head. He ate bacon and
  fried corn meal and went to bed hopelessly, wearily. And his last thought
  before he closed his eyes was of Jack and Jerry. What merry, merry companions
  they would have been for him! But now they were gone forever from him into
  the wilderness, and when he encountered them next they would not remember
  him. All that he had done for them had been thrown away!</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">There were dreadful times ahead for poor Tommy, but, of all
that was to
  come, nothing so stayed with him, nothing was so burned into his
  consciousness, as the fortnight which followed. Yet it should have been an
  easy time, for the spring was softening toward summer. All the forest stirred
  with life. And within a hundred yards of his home cave there lay an ample
  hunting ground for Tommy. He had no need to range abroad in search of game.
  It came up to his doorstep, so to speak, and invited the hand which destroyed
  it. Yet he grew thin and anxious. For one thing, an almost straight diet of
  meat is not good for a child, and though long walks through the forest
  hardened him, and the labor of cutting down trees and chopping, them into
  firewood seasoned his lithe, young muscles; still, as he grew harder he grew
  thinner. And worry was the poison in his life, the worry of loneliness.</p>

  <p>A boy overflows with talk. He is full of questions as a pine tree is full
  of needles. But all this chatter of light-hearted words and inquiry was
  dammed and stopped up in Tommy Parks. And he began to develop a deep wrinkle
  in the very center of his forehead, a wrinkle which should not have come
  there for another twenty years.</p>

  <p>Every day was a long agony of waiting - for what, he could not tell. But
  something must happen, something must flow into the sterile current of this
  life. That expectation took the form of hearing his father in every echo, his
  breath in the whisper of the wind among the trees, his footfall in the
  crackling of every twig, and sometimes Tommy would draw himself up with his
  small fists gripped, so keen was the suspense.</p>

  <p>And sometimes, too, he felt his brain whirl, his eyes grow misty, as the
  strain began to tell upon him. Every day was an eternity. It made no
  difference what he attempted to do. 'Thought came between him and the labor
  of his hands.</p>

  <p>There is always a saving grace of some kind. For Tommy, it came in the
  form of the sprouting of the corn which he had planted. In the rich soil of
  the sunshiny bank of the stream which trickled across his little tableland,
  the seed germinated quickly, and then the pale green shoots came feebly above
  the surface of the ground. Once up to the light, they flourished amazingly. A
  dozen times a day, Tommy went out to watch them growing, and when he sat at
  the mouth of his cave, listening and waiting for the men who must some day
  come to find him and save him, the play of the sun glistening upon the waving
  young stalks was a perpetual delight to him.</p>

  <p>And every young plant took on a different character in his eyes. There
  were some that prospered more than others, of course. There was one which was
  the dwarf, the weakling. And Tommy felt a keen affinity for it. Finally, he
  discovered that it was being crowded by a small rock on either side, and,
  when these were removed, it began to prosper like the others - or even more
  so. There seemed to be a greater energy in it, born of repression. It shot up
  noticeably every hour, so to speak. And Tommy was delighted by it. Though he
  kept the ground loose around all the others, that particular stalk he tended
  with an extra precision.</p>

  <p>It was at the end of that miserable fortnight of silence and dying hope,
  just after he had lain down in his blankets at the mouth of the cave, that a
  new adventure came. He had closed his eyes and turned on his side toward the
  cave when he heard a light, crunching sound on the gravel of the small
  plateau. That little sound was enough to bring Tommy into a sitting posture,
  fevered with hope. And as he jerked upright, a great growl turned his blood
  to ice.</p>

  <p>Six feet from him, a great grizzly reared up with dreadful arms raised,
  ready to strike. Through the twilight, and looking up, it seemed to Tommy
  that the monster was as tall as the trees. And he could not stir. Then, from
  behind the big bear, two little cubs came running to him, tumbled upon him,
  rolled him over, licked his face, bit at his hair, with a babel of noise and
  a flurry of many motions.</p>

  <p>Tommy got staggeringly to his knees, with a wriggling cub under either
  arm, and he saw that the great bear that had loomed so ominously above him
  the moment before, had now dropped upon all fours and was digging busily for
  an unexpected root near the entrance to the cave. The family had come back to
  him!</p>

  <p>Tears of joy started into the eyes of Tommy. He rolled the cubs gaily in
  the dirt. He boxed them on the ears and was soundly cuffed in turn. For a
  wild half hour they played. Then Tommy built up a great fire to celebrate the
  occasion, and the two little bears came close - staying near his side, since
  he was the fire master - and sat back on their haunches like two, bright-eyed
  little boys, to watch every dart of flame, every leap of the fire.</p>

  <p>They had been taught many of the mysteries of the wilderness in that last
  fortnight, but nothing their mother could show them rivaled the miracle of
  that living thing which had no life, that fluttering and whispering thing
  which blossomed out of harmless wood and had a sting which would rankle for
  hours in the tortured flesh.</p>

  <p>It was not fascinating to the cubs alone, but to the mother bear as well.
  She, too, came close. She, too, decided that safety lay in being as close to
  Tommy as possible. She, too, reared back on her haunches and sat up and
  grunted with satisfaction and unending surprise as the fire warmed her.</p>

  <p>That stomach had been hugely rounded since Tommy last saw her. How many
  grubs, what quantities of white roots, what millions of ants and bugs, what
  rabbits, what stalked birds, what hordes of honey, had poured down that
  insatiable gullet since she started out on her hunting expedition, Tommy
  could only vaguely surmise. But in the short two weeks she had put herself in
  excellent condition. The scars of the battering to which she had subjected
  herself in her efforts to get out of the cave were almost all concealed by
  the fur, though here and there was a place naked of hair.</p>

  <p>What she had become since she went back to the wilderness, Tommy could not
  guess, but now, when he stretched out his hand, she jerked her head quickly
  around to him, to be sure, but she made no indication of suspicion. She even
  grunted with loud pleasure when he rubbed her behind the ears.</p>

  <p>And even the joy of a fire to watch could not take all of the attention of
  the cubs away from Tommy. Now and again they would steal bright little
  glances at him, or flick a paw toward him, as though to make sure that he was
  not gone.</p>

  <p>A strange, strange picture, the four who sat there around the fire, bathed
  in the light, with the great, circling darkness behind them! But before long
  the strange odors wafted from the interior of the cave to the sensitive noses
  of the bears drew them in for a tour of inspection. Tommy took the last, lean
  remnant of his bacon and the flour and placed it on a high ledge at the side
  of the cave to which even the agility of the cubs could not attain. And,
  though mother bruin reared up and stretched as high as possible toward the
  fascinating fragrance, she soon abandoned the hopeless effort and went around
  examining whatever she could find. All was thoroughly probed by three acute
  noses, each of which was strongly attached to the memory of a separate bear,
  and, when this was done, the bears were sleepy and curled up within the
  radius of the firelight.</p>

  <p>But Tommy was so happy that he could not sleep. If he drowsed now and
  again, he was quickly awake. Every time he wakened, he had to step over and
  see how the three reposed. And, each time he came near, the watchful mother
  opened one eye and grunted recognition of him. And every time he looked at
  them, they reminded him more and more of dogs - wiser than any dogs that ever
  lived, and a thousand times more powerful, of course - but still, very
  doglike in their ways. And every time he looked at them, the more Tommy
  realized that life with these companions would be possible.</p>

  <p>He fell into a sound sleep just before dawn, and he was wakened, finally,
  by Jack and Jerry tumbling upon him at the same instant. It was a bright
  morning, with the pink hardly gone from the horizon, and all the snow-topped
  mountains more beautiful than Tommy had words to describe.</p>

  <p>He made a quick tour of the dozen bird traps which he kept scattered at
  favorable places near the home cave, and he came back with half that many
  prizes. Five of them went to Mrs. Grizzly; one was enough for him. And, while
  he cooked and ate his own portion, he was consumed with laughter, watching
  the mother eat while the cubs played with the flying feathers.</p>

  <p>Yet she had finished her five long before he had consumed his one. She sat
  by and licked her chops enviously while he ended his meal, but, to the
  surprise and wonder of Tommy, she made no effort to take the meat from him by
  force. And, indeed, he had noted before that she respected him always, as
  though she had been duly impressed by the strength which had worn away the
  imprisoning rock and loosed her.</p>

  <p>After breakfast, she showed signs of uneasiness and a desire to make off,
  and Tommy noted them with a failing heart. But at length he decided to wall
  up the mouth of his cave and, when she left, go on a trail with her. That, in
  short, was exactly what he did. Hurriedly, he tumbled the stones into place,
  while Jack and Jerry scurried to and fro, sniffing every stone as he stirred
  it, and making absurd efforts to imitate him. Jerry, in fact, managed to pick
  up a stone between his forepaws and waddled gravely along with it and dropped
  it in place, and Tommy laughed until his sides ached at the sight.</p>

  <p>Mother bruin, before he ended, was on the farther side of the clearing,
  calling to her youngsters impatiently. So the whole party started out to
  explore, going straight up the hillside. They set a pace for the first mile
  which Tommy found hard to follow, but at the end of that time the mother
  slowed her steps. She went slowly, slowly, her nose on the very ground, and
  Tommy thought that she must be getting the beginning of an important scent.
  But, when he ran up to her, he found that she was following a thick stream of
  ants and licking them up carefully as she went.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">The sight of such a diet gave Tommy a qualm of the stomach,
but mother
  bruin seemed to relish that food immensely. Jack and Jerry, incurable
  imitators, hurried to join in the fun. Here and there they went, sticking
  their noses into the train of ants, licking them up, and then ejecting them,
  to the huge amusement of Tommy, until finally the big bear decided that they
  were in her way and promptly cuffed them aside.</p>

  <p>As always, they pretended that the cuff and tumble had been exactly a part
  of their plans. Just where they fell, they arose, without a whimper, and
  began to dig eagerly for imaginary roots. Then both stopped at the same
  instant and looked keenly at Tommy as though to ask whether or not he had
  understood. And, though he understood perfectly, he swallowed his mirth -
  just as he would have done had they been boys of his own age and as keen
  witted as he.</p>

  <p>The old mother, in the meantime, had come to the end of the ant trail,
  which terminated in a great hill of newly-turned dirt covered with ants.</p>

  <p>Here she sat down on her haunches. It seemed to Tommy as though she were
  embarrassed by the riches which were presented to her. But not Madame
  Grizzly! Presently, with a rake of her claws, she opened the hill to its
  center. Behold the black swarm of the ants! Those which adhered to the bottom
  of her paw, she promptly licked off. Then the wet paw was laid in the midst
  of the hill again until the active ants swarmed thick on it again - when it
  was raised and cleansed with a few swipes of the long, red tongue. And so the
  game went on until the ants ceased to swarm - hundreds, thousands had been
  demolished by every stroke of that great tongue. Tommy felt that he had just
  witnessed the destruction of a great nation!</p>

  <p>Now she rose and went on through the bushes, but presently she stopped and
  veered sharply to the left. It was an old, rotten log which attracted her
  attention. A tug with a forepaw turned over a weight which a grown man could
  not have budged. And madame was instantly busy, to the horror of Tommy, in
  eating the fat, white grubs which were exposed!</p>

  <p>Truly, this was a varied diet! And who would have expected such a monster
  to pay attention to such small details of her table? But on she went,
  inveterate scavenger, and presently picked up and gobbled at a mouthful a
  dead bird - then on again, following the guidance of that matchless nose.</p>

  <p>Tommy felt that he was being truly initiated in the ways of the wild.</p>

  <p>They dipped into a hollow, in the center of which a streamlet had created
  a small bog, and here madame diverged from her course for the sake of
  wallowing in the soft, cooling mud. She came out again, shook herself with a
  vigor that sent the mud flying in all directions, then started up the farther
  slope, pausing here and there to rip her way down to roots and devour them,
  then swaying on with her clumsy stride, which covered such an amazing amount
  of ground.</p>

  <p>The strange thing was that the cubs could keep pace, but it seemed to
  require no particular effort of them, whereas Tommy was completely winded
  before the first hour had ended! Something must be done. A roll in the grass
  had cleaned the mud from bruin's back, and that suggested an expedient to
  Tommy.</p>

  <p>He approached her, when she was starting on after a slight pause during
  which she had ripped a rotten log to pieces and hunted for grubs inside it,
  to small purpose. When he dropped a hand on her back, she stopped short and
  swung her great head around. And when, cautiously, he slipped onto her back
  she shrugged her shoulders and shook the loose skin so violently that he was
  promptly knocked sprawling on the farther side.</p>

  <p>He got up a little bewildered and found her turned about sniffing him
  curiously. Once more he tried the experiment, and this time she allowed him
  to sit astride her without objection. And, so strangely mounted, up the slope
  they went together, swinging on at a gait that covered the ground with an
  amazing rapidity.</p>

  <p>And the heart swelled in Tommy. Surely he was the first who had ever been
  able to mount so strange a charger! To be sure, once or twice she paused and
  swung her head back at him with a growl of annoyance, but on the whole that
  burden was too small to impede her, and finally she went on contentedly. When
  she paused to dig for roots, or when she scented a woodchuck and began to
  claw through the dirt to rout the little fellow out of his hole, Tommy
  slipped down her back and stood aside to watch. But, when she climbed on
  again up a slope, he resumed his place on her back. And there was no
  objection.</p>

  <p>For one thing, food was coming the way of bruin thick and fast that
  morning. New scents, mingled scents of food trails, were crowding upon her.
  Besides, there was deeply engraved in her mind the memory that he had fed her
  when she was helpless. Freedom and food, the two main essentials of
  existence, had come to her from his hand, and even the brute intelligence of
  the bear could not forget.</p>

  <p>That was the first of a hundred expeditions with bruin. And during the
  hundred days Tommy felt that the bear must have covered easily thirty miles a
  day, in spite of all her pauses. She was a tireless traveler, rarely breaking
  out of her ordinary, scuffling walk, but swinging on at an astonishing rate,
  even in that walk. And unending hunger urged her to continue that journey so
  long as she remained unwearied. And weariness seemed to be no part of her
  make-up. Tommy saw her once work a whole hour digging out a woodchuck on a
  mountainside, tearing out the loose stones and standing up and piling the
  stones with her paws as deftly as a man could have done - stones which, a man
  could not have budged! So, tearing out the stones and piling them, digging
  out the dirt with her powerful claws, she worked down until she had moved a
  carload of heavy material - and the reward of all that tremendous labor was a
  single little woodchuck wriggling out of the dirt - a single mouthful for the
  big bear.</p>

  <p>But it was food, and every mouthful of food was worth working for. Tommy
  learned something from that - something to stir his gratitude. Wise and
  patient forager though she was, it took a day's work to supply her with
  provisions, but he, at a stroke, could supply himself with a meal. There was
  one serious impediment. He could not carry a gun with him when he went
  trailing with bruin. If he carried the revolver, she would permit him to
  attend, but he could not ride her up the hills. The scent of the detested
  steel would make her rear up, growling terrific threats, if he attempted to
  come too near. So he left the gun behind him. All he carried was matches.
  And, during the day, it was usually possible to rescue part of a rabbit from
  the grizzly after she had surprised one. It sometimes angered her, to be
  sure, but Tommy learned to pick his time, and, if it were after she had been
  foraging long and successfully, she did not seriously object if he purloined
  so small a part of her spoils.</p>

  <p>He took the fishing line with him, also. In fact, that provided some of
  the choice fun for Tommy, for, when they came to a promising stream, or to a
  deep, silent little pool, Madame Grizzly sat back on her haunches so far from
  the edge of the water that her shadow would not fall upon it. Then she would
  call her cubs to her with ominous growls. Sometimes, she would gather them to
  her side with her strong forelegs, strangely like a human mother would use
  her arms, and, when all was reduced to silence, she would turn with an eye of
  expectation to Tommy. And at once he became the hero of the hour.</p>

  <p>He would choose his place, attach the line to a small, light rod which he
  usually carried with him, and drop it into the pool and await results. And
  with what keen anticipation they all watched! Yet, when the fish came shining
  out of the water, there was no stir on the part of madame, and, if the cubs
  dared to move, she brought them back with a bruising blow of her great
  forepaws. So she waited until a fish was thrown to her; though, as a matter
  of fact, Tommy never had the heart to keep the first fish away from her. But
  she would sit there and gobble a dozen at a time, as fast as he could throw
  them to her. Great hunter though she was, she had no skill to match against
  this human cunning! It was small wonder that she now and then allowed this
  ample provider to take part in her own kills.</p>

  <p>In fact, their partnership was perfect. There was only one thing to spoil
  it, and that was that madame was prone to sleep during the middle of the day,
  and to hunt morning, evening, and in the night. But even to these habits
  Tommy accustomed himself. After all, cubs need sleep, and, by sleeping when
  they did, he secured rest enough. He learned to drop flat on his back in the
  shade of a tree, throw out both arms, and fall instantly asleep. And, five
  minutes later, he could wake up at the first, silent rising of madame and go
  with her over some arduous trail, running beside her over the level or down
  hill, and riding on her back when she climbed a slope.</p>

  <p>He learned many things during that hundred days. In the first place, he
  discovered the limits of madame's domain. He had always supposed that a
  grizzly wandered where she would up and down the mountains, but in this case
  he learned that madame had boundaries which she never crossed. The eastern
  limit was the timber line of those bald mountains over which Tommy had
  climbed. The northern boundary lay beyond several ranges some thirty miles
  from the Turnbull River. The Turnbull itself was the south line, and the
  western extremity of her province was about fifty miles from the timber line
  of the bald mountains down the valley of the Turnbull. That magnificent
  region she covered in a surprisingly short space of time. To be sure, it
  consisted of some fifteen hundred square miles of travel every day, and soon
  Tommy had seen her cross and recross every bit of her province.</p>

  <p>He himself learned the territory as though a map of it were printed in his
  mind. He knew every pond, every stream, every mountain and hill. He knew the
  big trees, the aspen groves, the thickening hedges of lodgepole pines where
  they climbed the upper ridges, the open places fit for a roll and a romp with
  the cubs.</p>

  <p>And the cubs, meantime, were waxing big and strong. When they stood up on
  their hind legs now and boxed with him, he was soundly beaten. With doubled
  fists, with keen eyes, with dancing feet, he would circle around them,
  dealing blows as swift and hard as he could, and they, for a time, would
  miss, or pretend to miss him, but, when they decided the play had gone far
  enough, one lightning and inescapable flick of a forearm would stretch him on
  his back with a bruised chest.</p>

  <p>It was rough play, but the whole life Tommy was leading was rough, and he
  had grown hard as nails. A grown man could never have adapted himself to such
  living, but Tommy was just past his twelfth birthday, now, and at twelve mind
  and body are almost as fluid as water and will take any sort of shaping. So
  long as Tommy was happy, he could stand anything.</p>

  <p>And he was happy, riotously happy! He was beginning to give up hope of
  being rescued by a traveler this summer or autumn - but the rescue could be
  put off until the winter and the height of the trapping season, he told
  himself. Even if someone came, they would hardly have found him at the cave,
  for he was away from it sometimes a week at a stretch. Besides, what mattered
  the future? Tommy was twelve!</p>

  <p>The autumn came, drowsy with mists, and then chill of nights. His precious
  corn had grown up, and the ears had turned into maturity and been plucked and
  laid away in the cave for future use, laid high on a shelf of rock, while
  Tommy vowed solemnly that no hunger should reduce him to the necessity of
  eating them, for he knew that, if he stayed in the valley another year, that
  corn meant bread to him.</p>

  <p>Autumn passed, then, and in early December the day came when Madame
  Grizzly began to lose her appetite. Tommy was prodigiously worried, but both
  mother and cubs seemed to be interested in nothing but sleep. And every day
  was worse than the preceding ones. They were irritable, also, and did not
  wish to be bothered by his attentions, and finally madame began to dig a
  cave. Tommy knew that she was preparing for the winter's sleep.</p>

  <p>She selected a spot among the northern mountains, a hillside that faced
  the south. There, under a thick matting of roots, she made her excavation.
  She dragged in a quantity of long, dried grass and shrubs. She assembled more
  brush at hand, and on a day she retired into it, followed by the cubs, and
  choked the entrance by drawing in brush after her. Tommy found himself once
  more left alone</p>

  <p>.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">It would be late in March or early April before she came
out again, he
  knew. In the meantime, the long white winter had begun in those upper
  mountains, and Tommy must prepare for a life in the snow.</p>

  <p>Yet his heart did not completely fail him. He knew the country in which he
  was living, he told himself, and he would manage excellently. For one thing,
  he had laid in a store of nuts during the late autumn. They would help him
  through the lowest periods of the starving winter. For the rest, he still had
  ammunition, and it would go hard if he could not keep himself in food. If he
  could have foreseen what was coming, he would probably have lain down and
  resigned all hope at once. But providence spares us too much foresight.</p>

  <p>His clothes were in tatters, but, as the cold increased, he began to wrap
  a blanket around him when he went out to hunt. And inside the cave he managed
  very well. He noticed on the roof of the cave a small section where roots
  grew down and it made him guess shrewdly that there was a considerable gap in
  the rock at that point. So he climbed on top with the shovel and dug down
  through the dirt until, to his delight, his shovel struck through into empty
  air. When he had finished his digging, he had uncovered a hole of ragged
  outline, two feet across, in the center of his roof. And that was his
  chimney. To be sure, a fire of wet wood or green wood would fill the cave
  insufferably with smoke, but on the whole the draft worked very well.
  Usually, he had a brisk, bright blaze which kept the cave comfortable, while
  a thick blanketing of smoke gathered in the top of the cave and slowly poured
  out through the opening.</p>

  <p>So furnished, he could defy the cold, and when the wind stood in the south
  he needed only to block the entrance to the cave with stones. Of course,
  there were vast, empty stretches when he was neither eating nor sleeping nor
  hunting nor cooking. But those periods he filled quite comfortably with
  reading the only two books which John Parks had put in his pack. Two books
  make up a small library, and these two could hardly have been better chosen
  for Tommy. There was a Bible, and there was a copy of Malory, both sadly
  battered by the packing, but both still readable. And to Tommy they were
  inexhaustible treasures. Malory he knew before in fragments. Now he devoured
  it whole. As for the Bible, he had felt it to be a great and dreary book fit
  for old women and Sunday, but, when the conversation-hunger drove him, he
  opened it perforce - and was suddenly lost in talks of old wars, wild
  vengeances, strange prophecies, inspired men. There was much of it which he
  could not follow easily, but he found long passages which were solid
  entertainment, and many and many a long hour he spent tracing out the words,
  one by one, with the motion of a grimy little forefinger.</p>

  <p>And grimy Tommy certainly was. Suppose a close look is made at him on the
  day of his tragedy, that fatal accident which nearly snuffed out poor Tommy's
  life. Hunger wakes him. He sits up in the dun twilight of the winter and the
  cave combined. He lights a fire, groaning and shivering at the cold. The
  rising tongue of yellow flame shows first a ragged mop of long hair, partly
  standing on end and partly falling down across ears and neck. He is huddled
  in a blanket which for the moment covers his body. The firelight gleams on a
  berry-brown face, thin, with the cheeks, which should be rounded by
  childhood, as flat and straight as the cheeks of a grown man. His eyes,
  sunken under frowning brows, glitter with the firelight; keen, blue eyes as
  restless as the eyes of Madame Grizzly herself.</p>

  <p>Now hunger rouses him. He stands up and goes to the nearest shelf of rock
  and takes from it two frozen fish, for yesterday he had broken the ice of a
  pool and had caught several prizes. But suddenly the thought of fish makes
  his stomach and throat close tight in revolt. He throws them back on the
  shelf. He steps into a pair of huge shoes - an extra pair of John Park's
  shoes, for his own were worn out that summer. He winds the blanket around him
  as deftly as an Indian chief. He goes to the entrance of the cave, rolls a
  stone back, and steps out onto the crackling, hard, frozen surface of the
  snow.</p>

  <p>There he stands, breathing deeply of the fresher air, the color leaping up
  into his cheeks. He is a tall boy for his age, big boned, with the promise of
  great bulk when he is matured - if he may live to maturity! But nine months
  of solitary life, solitary work and play in the wilderness, have hardened him
  like leather. The muscles of those lean, long arms have surprising
  strength.</p>

  <p>He looks about him upon a white world. All the mountains, which step away
  north and east and south, are sheeted like ghosts. The plateau is thick with
  snow, which has blown here and there into mounds and drifts. And the level
  branches of the evergreens are pressed down by thick layers of the heavy
  snow. A keen wind is blowing. It takes edges of the blanket and tugs them
  straight out. It pries through the loose folds of the cloth and sends its icy
  teeth through and through the slender body of the boy. But Tommy only shrugs
  his shoulders and steps out.</p>

  <p>Yonder he enters the forest. Here the walking is better, for he does not
  have to wade up to his knees through the snow. He needs to pick a course
  where the trees have sifted the snow to the side, and where the ground is
  covered with only a thin layer. But, even so, now and again he steps into a
  little hollow up to the waist. In half an hour he is wet and freezing cold.
  But still he shrugs his shoulders and sets his teeth. If he lives to a
  happier day and a greater strength, the world will have to pay him a heavy
  toll for all this pain!</p>

  <p>Now he stops short. His keen eyes have seen three little humps of snow and
  ice thrust up on a branch halfway to the top of a tall tree. He stands
  watching them intently, making sure. These are three young partridges, he is
  sure. They have roosted yonder in the early winter. Snow has covered them in
  a night. The warmth of their bodies has melted the nearest snow, so that it
  touches them in no place, and the heavy frost has frozen the outer layer of
  the snow to an iron- hard consistency. And so their winter house is made!</p>

  <p>While he stands there, moveless, his eye catches on something white as the
  very snow, and moving like an arrow across its surface. It is a weasel, that
  fierce little wolf which preys on all small life. It darts past almost across
  his feet, so intent is the terrible killer on the blood trail across the
  surface of the pure snow. Instantly, he is gone. Tommy looks after him with
  an involuntary shudder. Then he is into the branches of the tree. No matter
  that those branches are slippery with ice, no matter that the deft feet of
  Tommy are burdened with those great, oversized shoes; he is climbing to make
  a kill, and he will not slip.</p>

  <p>Up he goes. He lies out on the branch, twining his legs around it. He
  crumbles the first ice house. Yes, he was right! He wrings the neck of the
  poor bird and drops it to the ground, and so with the next, so with the
  third. But the third is smaller. He will carry it down with him. So he
  thrusts back a fold of the blanket and stuffs it into his coat pocket.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he thrills with fear. In that pocket are the matches, and they
  must not be moistened by this wet body.</p>

  <p>He jerks out the bird again, and behold! Down through the air flutters a
  whole drift of matches which have adhered to its damp feathers! The sharp
  wind catches them. They blow away in a cloud and disappear among the branches
  of the next tree.</p>

  <p>Poor Tommy! His heart stopped when he saw that dreadful mischance. He
  dropped the partridge unheeded. He thrust his hand into the pocket - not a
  match was left!</p>

  <p>For the moment, he lay there, half stunned by his fortune. And all he can
  see now is how small was that fire which he started to build before he left
  the cave. Down the tree he drops like a veritable monkey from branch to
  branch.</p>

  <p>He falls from the last one upon his face in the snow. But that is no
  matter. Neither do the precious birds matter to Tommy. Off he started, racing
  through the snow. If only the fire will last until he reaches the cave!</p>

  <p>But he has come much farther than he dreamed. It seems that he would never
  be able to cover the distance between. And at last, with burning lungs, with
  blinded eyes, with the blood pounding in his head, he rushes into the mouth
  of the cave and finds that the floor is black as night! Not one spark of the
  fire has lived!</p>

  <p>Above it he stands, sick and stunned. There are the small branches lying
  in a little circle, with their center portions burned away, until they were
  out of touch with one another, and so the flame died in the cold air.</p>

  <p>Tommy sinks down upon the sandy floor and presses his hands over his face.
  This, then, is the sentence of death! On raw meat he might live a little
  time, but without fire he must surely perish.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">The miserable days dragged on, and he still lived. He
managed, by heaping
  all the blankets and the tarpaulin upon him, to keep warm enough in the cave
  so long as he was lying down, but when he moved the cold ate into him
  venomously. If he had had the proper food, he could have endured well enough,
  but raw meat was more than his stomach could stand unless he were exercising
  vigorously, and in that bleak weather he dared not expose himself for long at
  a stretch. Gradually, his strength diminished. A great drowsiness began to
  grow in him. It spread through his body first - an aching fever, a false
  warmth, broken with fierce spells of shivering and utter cold. And then it
  reached his brain, so that he wanted to do nothing but lie still all the day
  in the heap of warmth- giving stuff which he had piled up.</p>

  <p>But, even in his drowsy times, there was an anguish of hunger, a craving
  for food which he could not have. He found himself wasting with a terrible
  rapidity. His body grew emaciated. His cheeks sunk. His hands, when he raised
  them, were wasted to such a point that he hardly recognized them. Yet, every
  day, in spite of that diminishing strength, he forced himself to get up and
  go into the great outdoors to see if he could sight some animal, some beast
  of prey, which he might kill with a rifle bullet to clothe himself in the
  pelt.</p>

  <p>Once he sighted a great timber wolf, but his shaking hands could not hold
  the weapon firm, and the bullet flew wide while the wolf trotted out of sight
  with the slowness of contempt for this puny hunter. He failed, thus, on the
  only occasion when he sighted a pelt worth having. And now the time came when
  he went out more and more seldom. And finally, for three successive days he
  did not leave the cave.</p>

  <p>It was only a sudden reflex of will that drove him out at length. He
  wakened one afternoon from a stupor. He hardly felt hunger now. A haze hung
  before his eyes. The same haze hung over his mind. But there was a sudden
  parting of the veil as he saw his hand raised before him, a mere, withered
  claw rather than a hand!</p>

  <p>The horror brought him erect. There he stood, shuddering in the cold, and
  realizing that when he lay down again it would be to fall into a sleep from
  which there was no waking. And fear drove him on more strongly than dread of
  the cold could keep him back. Presently, swathed in blankets, he staggered
  weakly out of the cave. A side draft of the wind caught him and knocked him
  flat. He rose again and went on blindly through the forest, the rifle
  dragging down in his hands as though it were of a ton's weight. He knew that
  even if he saw a fur worth having he could not shoot the wearer, and yet on
  he went, driven simply by a horror of the cave and the death to which he
  would be returning if he went back to it.</p>

  <p>He found himself stumbling across a raw, bare patch of earth from which a
  recent landslide had torn the trees and shrubs. And, tripping on a loose
  stone, he fell headlong for the tenth time. He was stunned by the fall. When
  he roused again, he found that he was half frozen, so frozen that when he
  leaned and picked up the gun the weapon fell from his numbed fingers and,
  striking a rock, knocked out a bright spark.</p>

  <p>Tommy stared with vague agony down at the stone. In the very rock there
  seemed to be fire. He alone in all creation was without warmth. He was still
  half dazed, half stupid, but that spark had fascinated him. Regardless of the
  harm that might be done the barrel, he dropped the rifle again, and again the
  spark jumped from the piece of flat, black stone.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he picked it up with a wild hope growing in him. Sparks will
  light fire. This must be a flint. What had the Indians used for centuries
  before him? With the stone hugged to his breast, with the rifle trailing
  behind him, he made on toward the cave as fast as his weak knees would
  support his strides.</p>

  <p>So, muddy from his falls, with a ringing as of bells in his ears, he
  entered the cave and looked about him for tinder. He found something
  excellent for his purpose - a pile of dried bark which he had used to start
  his fires while the matches lasted. Some of this he shredded to a bundle of
  small fibers, so brittle that they threatened to crumble to a powder. He
  gathered larger wood near by, and then he took the revolver, as a handier bit
  of steel, and, the flint dropped at an angle, he began to knock a shower of
  sparks upon the tinder.</p>

  <p>They fell all over the bark. A faint smoke arose, but when he ceased
  striking the flint the smoke died out. He worked until his weak arms ached.
  Then, as despair was coming over him, there was a new thought. He hammered
  again with all his might and main, tossed aside the battered gun as soon as
  he saw a small spot glowing on the bark, and began to fan this with his
  breath.</p>

  <p>He blew till his lungs threatened to burst, till his head grew dizzy, and
  behold, the smoldering spot of dark grew in width, ate into the bark.
  Hastily, he placed more shreds of the crumpled bark upon the spot. Again he
  blew. And now a thin column of smoke rose. To Tommy it was the most blissful
  sight he had ever seen. Literally, it meant life!</p>

  <p>Again he blew with all his might. The smoldering increased, grew audible.
  There was a faint sparkling, the smoke cloud increased tenfold. He began to
  fan the heap with a part of the blanket. And now the smoldering place became
  a vivid orange which lighted up his hands at work. Suddenly, a little tongue
  of flame shot up, quivered, while Tommy hung breathless over it, and then
  steadied into a swiftly growing blaze. He had made fire! He had made it of
  steel and stone and wood! And a great wave of gratitude flooded through
  Tommy. He cast up his arms. Tears streamed down his face.</p>

  <p>But he dared not wait. Quickly, he threw on the bits of wood. The smoke
  rose again as the fire worked. Then a new and stronger flame burst out. And,
  like a madman, he threw on more and more wood. A roaring blaze shook up
  toward the top of the cave. A soaring flame licked against the roof itself.
  And Tommy sat down with his blanket thrown away, unneeded, his arms put out
  to the heavensent heat!</p>

  <p>A month later, on a day, there blew up a warm wind. It was a true Chinook.
  It melted the snows in the lower valleys as though a fire had been built upon
  them. In a fortnight Tommy had dry footing for his hunting trips.</p>

  <p>He came out from the winter prison hollow cheeked, still weak in body from
  the great ordeal, but full of pride, full of invincible confidence in his
  strength to face any ordeals before him.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">He made his first trip to the cave of Madame Grizzly. The
entrance was
  still blocked with brush. He exerted no effort to rouse them. He was wise
  enough to understand that there is no safety in interfering with mother
  nature when she is at her work.</p>

  <p>So he went back down the slopes, finding every trail crossed with rivulets
  fed from snows that were melting under the trees. It was on this trip that he
  made his first kill of big game. Something stirred in a thicket before him.
  He jerked out the revolver and stood eagerly waiting, and in a moment a
  little, brown-bodied deer stepped into view, and Tommy fired.</p>

  <p>He almost regretted what he had done as he stood over the beautiful little
  body a moment later, but life in the wilderness is a grim thing. It is kill
  or be killed, and Tommy had lived here long enough to understand it.</p>

  <p>Many times he had seen his father cut up deer. And now he set busily to
  work getting off the hide. There was many a slip of the knife, many a slit in
  the tender pelt, but eventually, after a weary task of tugging and pulling
  and cutting, the work was done, after a fashion. Then he cut the deer into
  quarters, hung three parts as high as he could on a shrub, and carried one
  ham back to the cave.</p>

  <p>To roast a quarter in the Dutch oven was a considerable task. Moreover, it
  was one which he had never performed before except under the strict
  supervision of his father. And it was dark in the cave before he peered at
  his cookery and decided that it was done. And what a fragrance greeted his
  nostrils as he opened the oven! Surely, that was worth waiting for.</p>

  <p>He had just sat back to enjoy the meal in prospect, when a human voice,
  the first he had heard in almost a year, spoke from the entrance.</p>

  <p>"Hello, son!"</p>

  <p>He leaped to his feet with a shout of astonishment. And he saw that a big,
  rough-bearded man had just crawled through the entrance to the cave and had
  risen to his height - a huge, thick-shouldered man in the later middle of
  life.</p>

  <p>There was one pang of disappointment, of unbearable sorrow, in Tommy as he
  saw that it was not John Parks come back to him. In that instant, hope of the
  return died forever in his breast. And, in another breathing space, he was
  wild with joy because a human being had at last crossed his trail. The long
  silence was ended. He went to the big man with a rush.</p>

  <p>"Oh," cried Tommy, "how did you come - how did you come? How did you find
  me?"</p>

  <p>Here the big fellow stepped back from him, gathered his bushy brows, and
  peered down at Tommy with little black, bright eyes.</p>

  <p>"Look here, son," he said, "you ain't telling me that you're living here
  alone, are you? Your pa ain't here with you?"</p>

  <p>He said this with an eagerness which Tommy could not understand, and the
  boy told all his story in ten words. But, the instant he had learned that
  John Parks was dead, the stranger seemed to lose all interest in the rest of
  the narrative and the story of Tommy's sufferings. He strode forward, lifted
  the cover, and inhaled the fragrance of the roasted venison.</p>

  <p>"We'll eat now," he said, "and we'll talk things over later on."</p>

  <p>And, so saying, his big knife instantly slashed into the vitals of the
  roast. He began to eat wolfishly, and Tommy, amazed and bewildered by such
  treatment, stood for a time in the offing. When he approached to take
  something for himself, the stranger lifted his eyes with a silent glare, and
  Tommy retreated again. Not until the big man had ended his meal, bolting the
  meat in great chunks, could Tommy take a portion in what he considered
  safety.</p>

  <p>By this time he was thoroughly frightened, but the black-bearded fellow
  had reclined against a stone and spread out his legs toward the fire. He
  began to roll a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Make yourself handy, son," he grunted after a time when the cigarette was
  lighted and he had blown a cloud of smoke upwards. "Get some wood on that
  fire."</p>

  <p>Tommy moved as though he had been struck with a whip, half choking on the
  mouthful he was eating. And, after he had obediently heaped on the wood and
  the flame was soaring, the fear of the taciturn stranger had increased in him
  to such an extent that his throat closed and he could not speak. He sat
  watching and waiting uneasily. And still the stranger did not stir, but
  seemed to drink up the heat of the fire, while his eyes bored into Tommy.</p>

  <p>The boy began to notice the equipment of the big man, now. He was wearing
  rough clothes which were plastered with mud and torn with a thousand small
  rents, such as come when one rushes recklessly through dense forest or climbs
  over rough rocks with many a slip and fall. Also, in spite of the bushy beard
  of the man and his stalwart frame, Tommy saw that the upper part of his
  cheeks were sunken and his eyes buried. Plainly, he had made a long and
  hurried march. He had made it on foot, and he had made it without so much as
  a blanket. Yet he had chosen to carry a perfect arsenal of guns and
  ammunition. He was weighed down with a Colt and a heavy cartridge belt
  crammed full of bullets, and now there rested beside him a repeating rifle of
  the newest and most expensive model. Tommy could see that it had been
  scrupulously cared for. There was not so much as a scratch upon the wood of
  the butt.</p>

  <p>From these things he began to make deductions actively. Men did not travel
  over the mountains hastily in the time of the thaw, equipped with only guns
  and bullets, unless they were either pursuing or fleeing. And something told
  Tommy that this was not a case of pursuit. Men who pursue are fearless, and
  the keen eyes of this fellow rested upon even a boy like Tommy with a world
  of suspicion and cautious reserve.</p>

  <p>"Look here, kid," he said suddenly, "how long you been here?"</p>

  <p>"Almost a year," said Tommy.</p>

  <p>"A year!" said the other. "And nobody ain't been near you all that
  time?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody," said Tommy.</p>

  <p>"Not a soul, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Not a soul."</p>

  <p>The big man drew a great breath, and then, in silence, he stared off into
  vacancy. Presently, he began to smile. Evidently, what he had learned had
  pleased him immensely.</p>

  <p>"And," said Tommy, "I'd like to know when we start on."</p>

  <p>"What?" said the stranger. "When we start on?"</p>

  <p>"I - I thought," said Tommy, "that you'd take me with you when you
  went."</p>

  <p>The other laughed with a brutal abruptness.</p>

  <p>"Now, why," said he, "are you aching to get back to other folks? What'll
  they do for you? Nothing! Look at the way I been treated by everybody! Look
  at the way everybody has treated me!"</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly and eyed Tommy in that keen way he had, until he
  apparently decided that there was nothing to fear. He shrugged his shoulders.
  His tongue loosened.</p>

  <p>"There ain't no justice down among men," he said in a voice half gruff and
  half whining. "They don't give a man a chance. Look at me! Is a gent
  responsible for what he does when he's got some hooch under his belt? No, he
  ain't. No right-thinking man can say that he is. But I wake up with a
  headache, not knowing what I've done, and find about a dozen of 'em chasing
  me with dogs and guns. No questions asked. They just open fire when they
  sight me. Well, says I to myself, what's all the fuss about? What have I
  done? But there ain't any use waiting to get my questions answered with a
  slug through the head, so I foot it for the hills and give 'em the clean slip
  and have a dang hard trip - and finally I wind up here! And here's where I'm
  going to stay, and here's where you're going to stay!" he added fiercely. "I
  ain't going to have nobody sneaking out and telling where I am. If you've
  been here a year without nobody finding you, I guess I can stay here a year
  the same way. And by that time things will have cleared up a little, and I
  can go down and look around and see how the land lies. Ain't that sense?"</p>

  <p>He seemed to be speaking to himself more than to Tommy, and the boy kept a
  discreet silence. Suddenly, the head of the fugitive jerked around, and the
  keen little brute eyes glared at Tommy.</p>

  <p>"Come here!" he roared.</p>

  <p>Tommy came, trembling. The big hand of the stranger shot out and clamped
  around Tommy's wrist. The pressure seemed to be cracking the bones.</p>

  <p>"You're going to stay right on here with me, kid!" he thundered. "Besides,
  if you can forage for one you can forage for two. So you start in and make me
  comfortable. And there ain't going to be no getting away. If you try to run
  for it, I'll start out and trail you, and I'm the outtrailingist man you ever
  seen. I'd run you down inside a couple of hours, and then I'd tear you to
  bits!"</p>

  <p>His eyes snapped, and his teeth gleamed behind his beard as he spoke. And
  Tommy's heart turned cold.</p>

  <p>"Speak out!" roared the big man. "Tell me how you like me."</p>

  <p>"Fine!" stammered poor Tommy. "I - I like you fine."</p>

  <p>"You lie!" cried the big man, and with a sweep of his thick arm he knocked
  Tommy flat on his back.</p>

  <p>The sting of the blow on his cheek worked like a strange madness in Tommy.
  He had been accustomed to the gentle ways of John Parks. He could not
  understand a rough voice and a heavy hand. And, unreasoning, he came off the
  ground like the recoil of a cat and flew at the face of the stranger.</p>

  <p>The latter had barely time to erect a guard, and that guard was
  insufficient. He lurched to his feet while the stinging, small fists were
  cutting into his face with a rain of blows. Once erect, he pushed Tommy away
  with a long, extended arm. The wonder left his face. A cruel interest took
  its place. And he poised his great, right hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to lesson you," he said savagely, drawing his breath in with
  joy at the prospect. "I'm going to give you one lesson for the sake of
  manners and showing you who's the boss. Stand off, you imp!"</p>

  <p>The last word was a grunt of rage as Tommy slipped under the extended arm
  and struck savagely into the body of the big man. And then the blow fell. It
  came straight and hard, with the overmastering weight of the stranger's
  shoulder behind it. It struck Tommy on the side of the head and rolled him
  along the ground.</p>

  <p>He lay there stunned with a sting along the side of his face and a warmth
  which told him that the skin had been broken by that brutal stroke.</p>

  <p>"Get up!" roared the big man. And he kicked Tommy with his heavy boot.</p>

  <p>That wild anger leaped into the heart of the boy again. He came off the
  ground, how, he could not say, and sprang into the face of the stranger.</p>

  <p>"You little wildcat!" gasped out the big man and recoiled, though driven
  more by astonishment than by his hurts.</p>

  <p>That instant of recoil, however, gave another opportunity to Tommy. He
  leaped to the pile of dried wood which he had heaped along one side of the
  cave, and a second later the billet cracked heavily along the sconce of the
  stranger. Again Tommy struck, and again he shouted with a wild satisfaction
  as he felt the wood bite soft and heavy into flesh. Then the stick was torn
  from his hand. He leaped away, and he raced for the entrance to the cave,
  knowing that now nothing could save him but flight. The big man was not
  cursing, and his silence meant strangely more than oaths.</p>

  <p>He was almost at the entrance when something told him to dodge. Down he
  dropped in a heap. And barely in time. The scooping arms of the big man swept
  over him, brushing his clothes. The toes of the stranger's boot lodged with
  sickening force against his ribs. Then the other crashed against the rocks
  with a shout of pain and rage. But Tommy, rising hastily to his feet again,
  knew that his finish had come, for now the big man was between him and the
  mouth of the cave!</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">He slipped back into the very center of the cave where he
would have more
  room. Yet he knew that even there he was playing a losing game. In speed of
  foot, in endurance, he could not compare with the grown man. Presently, he
  would be cornered, and the great, bone-breaking hands would fall upon him.
  After that -</p>

  <p>His horrified mind grew blank. But, having picked up another stick of
  wood, he waited. He might strike and dodge at the same time and so gain
  another chance to get at the outlet. But that chance was only one in ten. And
  he glanced longingly up the side of the cave where he had laid away rifle and
  revolver on a higher shelf. Oh, fool that he had been to put his weapons in a
  place where they were not instantly accessible!</p>

  <p>The stranger seemed to have the same thought. He had risen slowly from the
  ground, drawing out his revolver as he did so. But a second of thought seemed
  to reassure him. He pushed the Colt back into its holster. And he began to
  advance slowly with such a face of fiendish rage that Tommy was paralyzed.
  No, there would be no dodging now! This cold fury would prove inescapable. He
  saw a tiny trickle of crimson down the face of the man and into the beard.
  That red mark would be warrant for his own destruction, beyond a doubt.</p>

  <p>"Now," gasped out the other, "now - we'll try something!"</p>

  <p>And he came with his great arms spread out, moving with long, stealthy
  strides as though he were stealing up on an unwatchful victim. And in that
  nightmare horror Tommy could not move.</p>

  <p>It was then he saw a dark form emerging out of the spot of black night at
  the mouth of the cave. With Jack and Jerry crowding behind her, in waddled
  Madame Bruin with as much assurance as though into her own cave. And a shout
  of joyous welcome, a cry of wildest relief burst from Tommy's lips.</p>

  <p>That shout made the big man whirl on his heel. One instant he stood
  petrified with astonishment. Then madame reared up and stood immense on her
  hind legs, with a roar at this unexpected stranger. Another moment, and she
  would have taken to her heels. But the big man did not wait. He plunged to
  the side of the fire and snatched up his rifle and pitched the butt into the
  hollow of his shoulder. It happened all in a twinkling. The gun spoke, and
  madame pitched heavily forward and died before she struck the ground.</p>

  <p>There was a hoarse shout of exultation from the man. The rifle steadied
  again, spoke again, and Jack, with a squeal of agony, whirled around, doubled
  up on the ground with the pain, and then stretched out limp. And there stood
  Jerry, bewildered, sitting back on his haunches in the most utter amazement
  and looking to Tommy as though for explanation of this strange
  catastrophe.</p>

  <p>Tommy's fear for himself was forgotten. He saw the gun steady. But he
  sprang at the big man, and the shock of his body made the other shoot
  wild.</p>

  <p>"Curse you!" cried the murderer, and with a short-arm blow he struck Tommy
  to the ground. "Your turn comes last!"</p>

  <p>"Run, Jerry!" shouted Tommy as he lay in the dirt.</p>

  <p>But Jerry did not run. His brain was not what it would be a day hence. It
  was thick and sleepy from the long hibernation. And calamities had rained
  down so fast upon those around him that his keen mind was stunned. He sat up
  there still with his head cocked to one side and innocently faced the
  rifle.</p>

  <p>So much Tommy saw with a side glance, and he saw, too, that the big man
  was steadying the rifle for another shot, steadying it carefully. Thereafter,
  he would tell how he slew three grizzlies with three shots in as many
  seconds.</p>

  <p>But fear for Jerry raised Tommy. He stood up with a shrill cry. Only with
  a gun could this destroyer be stopped. And he reached for the butt of the
  revolver at the big man's thigh just as the other, with an oath, struck him
  down again. He fell, but his fingers had gripped the weapon and drawn it
  forth. There he lay with black night swirling around his brain.</p>

  <p>"I'll brain you!" thundered the big man and reached for the weapon which
  Tommy had stolen.</p>

  <p>And Tommy pulled the trigger. He fired blindly. All before him was thick
  night. And in answer to the bullet a crushing weight fell upon him, and he
  felt that he had failed. After that the darkness was complete.</p>

  <p>When he wakened, Jerry was licking his face.</p>

  <p>He sat up with his brain still reeling. There lay the big-bearded man on
  his face beside him, motionless. And in the entrance to the cave lay madame
  and Jack, in the same postures of their fall.</p>

  <p>That sight was enough to bring Tommy to himself. He stood up and ran to
  make sure. It was not the human being for whom he felt concern. It was not
  dread for having taken a human life that stung Tommy. It was overwhelming
  remorse that the affection which had brought Madame Bruin to him had brought
  her to her death.</p>

  <p>But she was quite dead, and Jack was dead beside her. He took the great,
  unwieldy head in his lap. Jerry sniffed the cold nose and then looked up with
  a whine into the face of his young master for explanation. But Tommy could
  only answer with tears.</p>

  <p>Then, in the midst of his grief, he shook his fist toward the inert form
  of the killer. Here was man at last, man for whose coming he had yearned so
  bitterly. This was the work of man!</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">The first minute of waiting is always the longest. That
first year in the
  valley of the Turnbull was always the longest to Tommy. It seemed to him that
  it embraced more than half of his life, for fear and loneliness and weakness
  and peril had lengthened every day to an infinity. But the time that followed
  flew on wings. Every minute was crowded. There is no dull moment to the man
  who tears his living by force of hand and force of cunning out of the
  wilderness. And when events happen most swiftly, time seems to fly on the
  strongest wing. To Tom Parks it seemed that there was only one stride through
  the next few years. So let us step across them in the same manner, with one
  step, and come to Tom in the spring of his sixteenth year.</p>

  <p>A babble of sharp noises wakened him, the daybreak chorus of the forest.
  And Tom rose from his bed on a bearskin thrown across soft pine branches. He
  stood up, now grown to his full height of a shade more than six feet,
  equipped with nearly a hundred and seventy pounds of iron-hard muscle. He
  looked four years more than his sixteen, except that the down of manhood was
  only beginning to darken on his upper lip and on his chin. But that crease of
  pain and thoughtfulness which had been cleft in the center of his forehead
  had never departed, and there was a resolution, an independence of a grown
  man in his face.</p>

  <p>He stretched his arms, long and powerful, until the last of the sleep fled
  tingling out at his fingertips. He yawned and exposed a set of white, perfect
  teeth. Then with a shake of his head he tore off the shirt in which he had
  lain down to sleep.</p>

  <p>It was made of the softest buckskin sewed with sinew - a roughly made
  garment with mere holes for the head and the arms. His trousers were of the
  same stuff, ending in a ragged fringe between knee and ankle. He dropped them
  from him and stood naked in the chill of the morning air - brown as though
  carved cunningly out of bronze.</p>

  <p>Through the cave he sped, into the rosy flush of morning sunlight; then, a
  flashing form, he was down the slope to where the creek swirled into a deep,
  long pool. He leaped onto a rock and stood a moment before plunging in.
  Around him he heard life waking in the woods. He heard birds calling. He
  heard swift rustlings which were not of the wind among the foliage. Far above
  him a hawk flew. He marked its flight with interest. No, it was not a hawk.
  It was a great eagle. A hawk, at that height, would seem far smaller. Yes, it
  was an eagle; no doubt that old eagle of Bald Mountain. Tom Parks turned his
  head to watch until the speeding king of the air was shut from view past the
  treetops. Then he lowered his head and dived.</p>

  <p>The water closed behind his feet without noise, with hardly a ripple. And
  silently he came to the surface again, turned on his face, and swam with
  long, strong, silent strokes straight ahead. It seemed that he would surely
  strike the great trunk which shot out from the bank, with its tangle of
  drowned branches. But, when he was a foot away, up flashed his legs, down
  went his head. He was under the trunk, then came, all noiseless as ever, to
  the surface, trod water until he was exposed to the breast, and stood there
  laughing silently.</p>

  <p>But that water was snowfed, ice cold. And even the leather skin and the
  tough muscles of Tom's body could not keep out the chill from vital places.
  Back he turned for the shore. The long arms slipped through the water. And
  without a splash he came to shore.</p>

  <p>The sun turned him to a figure of gleaming, running quicksilver. But that
  wind blowing on his wet skin was too cold. He slicked the water from his body
  with his hands. Then he picked a section of clean grass, lay down, and rolled
  in it. He came up drier, and dirtier. He brushed off the leaves and what dirt
  would come. For the rest - what did he care? Dirt meant nothing in the life
  of Tom Parks. He wrung the water out of his long, sun-faded brown hair and
  then raced up the slope to the cave.</p>

  <p>Still he was not dry enough to dress. Many a day of stiff muscles and an
  aching body had taught him that it is better to have a dry skin before
  clothes are put on it. So he stepped to the side of the cave where a huge
  grizzly lay asleep. Into the side of the monster he thrust his toes and
  jabbed the ribs under their layer of thick pelt and fat.</p>

  <p>Jerry awoke with a grunt, blinked, and then straightway stood up. He had
  grown into a monster even of his monstrous kind. There was well over a
  thousand pounds of meat and bone and hide in this giant; there would be even
  more when the autumn nuts had fattened him.</p>

  <p>He put out his arms like a man stretching. But, the instant he did so, Tom
  Parks was at him. The hard shoulder of the youngster struck the breast of the
  bear. The long, brown arms wrapped around the furry body. With all his might
  he strove to topple Jerry. Topple half a ton's weight of heaven-taught
  wrestler?</p>

  <p>Jerry merely grunted. With one bone-crushing hug he squeezed the breath
  out of Tom's body. Then came a flick of the forepaw, and Tom Parks was sent
  staggering to a distance. He gasped, but he came in again with a rush. His
  flying fists struck home on the solid body - one - two - but again came that
  inescapable stroke of the paw. It was nicely judged - oh, how delicately
  managed! A little more, and he could have caved in Tom's chest with the
  stroke, but Jerry was an old hand at this game, and he struck just hard
  enough to knock Tom flat on his back.</p>

  <p>He was up again, like a cat, but that had been enough boxing for one
  morning. He was in a glow of heat, and the blood was coursing strongly
  through his arteries. He brushed off the sand, stepped into his buckskin
  suit, and slipped moccasins onto his feet. He was ready for the day!</p>

  <p>Jerry went out to hunt for grubs on the hillside while Tom kindled a fire.
  Over that fire he fried flat thin cakes of corn meal mixed with water. No
  meat till night for Tom. He had formed that habit long ago. But when evening
  came he would eat enough for three.</p>

  <p>That quick breakfast done, he went out down the hillside and, with a
  shrill whistle, brought Jerry after him. Down they went across the plateau
  where that year's crop of corn was burgeoning out above the ground.</p>

  <p>Jerry roved in the rear. He was an incurable loiterer. There were
  thousands of food scents blowing to his nostrils every instant. He had to
  stop a few minutes here and a few minutes there to demolish a colony of ants
  or to turn a log and get at grubs or to tear a rotten stump to pieces because
  of the horde of insect life it harbored. Besides, he could overtake the
  master at will, for on one of these roving expeditions after amusement Tom
  loitered through the forest, seeing and hearing and learning out of an
  inexhaustible book.</p>

  <p>When there was an expedition to a distant point on hand, that was quite
  another matter. Then one sharp, shrill whistle apprised Jerry that there was
  business on hand, and he forgot his appetite until the point was reached. But
  what he much preferred was one of these leisurely scouting trips. They might
  be back by night. They might not return for a week, for he had noted that Tom
  took with him the fishing line as well as his hunting knife. As for a gun,
  his store of ammunition had been used up long before! But the line and hook
  were enough, and, if he wanted additional food, he knew a dozen sorts of bird
  traps which he could make and bait with good results. As for fire, he carried
  a piece of flint and the barrel of the demolished old Colt revolver. He could
  raise a flame when he willed.</p>

  <p>Jerry did not sight Tom again until noon, and then he came up to the youth
  lying prone on a bank of grass and peering around a tree trunk to watch
  beavers busily at work cutting down trees. It was a new dam near the mouth of
  one of the Tumbull's tributaries. The water had been backed into a little
  gorge, and the beavers were just beginning to levy their toll on the forest.
  A dozen saplings were down and trimmed of branches, and Jerry stretched
  contentedly beside Tom to watch the work. To be sure, beaver meat was good,
  very good, and there was always an unfilled corner in that capacious belly of
  him. But now the little fellows were laboring so close to the edge of their
  pond that it would be impossible to surprise them. And, next to eating, Jerry
  loved to satisfy his curiosity.</p>

  <p>It was a whole long hour before Tom had gazed his fill. Then he stood up
  and clapped his hands, and he laughed silently and heartily as the beavers
  dived for shelter beneath the water. He had learned his noiseless swimming
  from them, but he could never match their craft in water ways. But here was
  something worth knowing - this new dam. It was another treasure added to his
  horde. In the winter he would come down here and get enough fur to clothe him
  like a prince through the season of the snows.</p>

  <p>All the rest of that day Tom headed leisurely westward down the valley of
  the Turnbull. Jerry followed, though in high discontent, for, by the evening,
  they had passed the limits of the territory over which Jerry's mother had
  roamed, and which Jerry and Tom had taken as their natural domain since the
  death of the wise old grizzly. But, as evening came, a windfall came to Jerry
  in the shape of a fat buck.</p>

  <p>There had been born in Jerry the skill of all grizzlies in slipping
  silently through a forest, in spite of their bulk. And so it was, gliding
  through the twilight, that he came suddenly on the rank scent of meat and an
  instant later - for they had turned directly into the wind - the deer sprang
  up before him in a thicket. Confusion made the poor creature run into the
  jaws of destruction. A crushing blow smashed its skull, and both Jerry and
  Tom dined in state that evening.</p>

  <p>With the morning when Jerry was preparing to turn back, hugely uneasy at
  this venturing into unknown country, Tom persisted in holding straight on
  down the valley. What moved him to it, he did not know, but in this wandering
  down the course of the Turnbull there had awakened in him a sudden and fierce
  disgust with the cave and everything in it, and all the delightful country
  which he called his own: There was no temptation to go back over the bleak
  mountains which he had climbed with his father, but a hunger of curiosity
  grew up in him to see what undiscovered country lay westward.</p>

  <p>Already he had come farther west than ever before, and still the pangs of
  curiosity increased, and he went on. In spite of the careless mode of travel,
  they had covered a full thirty miles on the first day. On the second, the
  distance was a great deal more, for Tom pushed on relentlessly from dawn to
  midday. Then he rested, and both he and Jerry slept. But in the evening they
  pushed on once more.</p>

  <p>So it was that they came to the first settler's cabin. It was almost dark,
  but far away Tom heard a faint, ringing sound which he presently recognized
  as the blows of an ax, clipped home with great force into hard wood. The
  sound ceased before he came close, but it was easy to continue to the place,
  with Jerry leading the way with an acute nose.</p>

  <p>And so they reached the verge of a man-made clearing. There was an acre of
  naturally cleared land. And there were ten acres more which had been cleared
  by cutting down the trees. In the exact center was a small log cabin whose
  open door was flooded with light and shadow flung in waves from an open
  fireplace. And a guitar was tinkling and thrumming from the interior.</p>

  <p>The heart of Tom leaped within him. The wind blowing through the trees
  above him was suddenly as mournful as a human sigh. And big Jerry, as though
  smitten with a sudden dread, turned about and looked Tom squarely in the face
  to read his thoughts. Perhaps it was only because the sensitive nose of Jerry
  was telling him tales of bacon and ham and a score of other delectables, and
  he was silently wondering why the master did not proceed to investigate.</p>

  <p>But now the music ceased, and a great, rough, bass voice spoke. It made
  the very hair on Tom's head bristle as he recalled that unforgettable voice
  of the man who had killed Jerry's mother. A man with such a voice could not
  but be an enemy made terrible by the possession of firearms.</p>

  <p>In the gathering night, he turned from the house and made a gesture to the
  grizzly that sent the latter into retreat. But it was not to be an altogether
  peaceful journey. A shifting of the wind had blown their scent to the house,
  and suddenly, behind them, came the yelling of dogs, sweeping closer, then
  breaking with a confusion of echoes through the forest as they entered the
  trees. And Jerry stood up with a profound growl to listen, while Tom,
  realizing that they could not flee from these fleet-footed assailants,
  planted himself beside the bear with a drawn knife.</p>

  <p>Instantly, they came, four huge, wolfish beasts, scarred with many a
  battle. They recoiled at the sight of the man. But on the bear was the scent
  of this man, and the bear scent was equally on the man. Their minds were
  instantly made up, and they flew to the attack. Two leaped at Jerry from in
  front. But they were wise fighters. They made only a pretense of attack. The
  real work must come from those in the rear. The other pair, trained fighters
  that they were, jumped to take the bear at disadvantage, and here it was that
  they encountered Tom.</p>

  <p>His heart was raging with excitement, but he had learned that first great
  lesson of the wilderness, where all creatures fight to kill, that successful
  battle can only be waged with a cool head. Half crouched, ready to leap to
  either side, he poised the long knife. One brute rushed for his legs, and the
  other drove at his throat. He leaped high to avoid the first and, twisting to
  miss the second, he slashed it across the gullet as it flew by him.</p>

  <p>He himself landed heavily on his side. He twisted to his feet like
  lightning. The dog he had used the knife on was standing to the side, head
  down, coughing and bleeding to death. But the first brute, wheeling as it
  missed its rush, was on him in a twinkling. The eye could barely follow the
  moves of Tom then. He sprang like a cat to the side, caught the great brute
  by the scruff of the neck, and, as the animal whirled to sink its teeth in
  his arm, he drove the knife home between its ribs.</p>

  <p>His arm was bloody above the wrist as he turned back to Jerry, just in
  time to see one of the dogs, half wolf and half mastiff, venture too close. A
  lightning blow of the forepaw, and a crushed skull for the dog were the
  result. The fourth dog leaped back, viewed the carnage for an instant, and
  then fled in dismay, howling.</p>

  <p>Jerry made a lunge in pursuit, but Tom called him back, for voices of
  excited men were sounding not far away, and men meant guns, and guns meant
  that the only safety lay in flight. A low whistle apprised Jerry that
  overwhelming odds were now opposed to them, and Tom took to his
heels.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p class="first">He ran like the wind during the first quarter of a mile,
weaving deftly
  through the trees, for he had been trained to such night work by many a prowl
  in company with Jerry. He could read the ground underfoot almost as though he
  saw in the dark. After that first sprint, as the voices died away behind him,
  he still ran on like a wild thing which cannot measure danger but only knows
  that it is somewhere in the rear, an indescribable thing. His swift and easy
  stride did not slacken until ten miles were behind him.</p>

  <p>Then, breathing hard, but by no means winded, he went ahead at a brisk
  walk, with Jerry lumbering and grunting behind him. They encountered a steep
  hill. He slipped onto Jerry's back, and they went up it handily. Down the
  farther slope they ran again, and so they hurried on through the night.</p>

  <p>Just before dawn, he paused at a creek and spent an hour fishing with
  great results for Jerry and himself. Then they pushed on until midmorning,
  reached the forested crest of a hill, and there made their covert.</p>

  <p>They slept soundly until midafternoon and wakened as they had fallen
  asleep - in an instant. They climbed on, then, to a higher range of hills to
  the westward, and here, from the naked summit, Tom found that he was looking
  out on more than he had dreamed of.</p>

  <p>Far to the east, the Bald Mountains were lost in the pale horizon haze.
  All that he could see was the procession of rolling, forested hills which
  climbed up the valley of the Turnbull. North, behind him, rose higher hills,
  climbing to naked mountain heights. South stretched the wide expanse of the
  valley, with the broad Turnbull flashing in the midst and sweeping away to
  the west in lazy curves quite different from the arrowy little stream which
  he knew near the cave and through his own territory.</p>

  <p>Westward, also, lay the things which most amazed him. In this direction
  the air was free of mist, the hills sloped away to smoother forms, and he saw
  the landscape dotted with houses and checked in loose patterns with fences.
  And yonder, not quite lost to his view, the houses collected in a village, a
  thick cluster of roofs and trees.</p>

  <p>And for years all of this had lain hardly more than a hundred miles from
  his own cave! He would have welcomed that sight four years before. This
  prospect would have been better than a promise of heaven to the lonely boy.
  But that was before the big stranger came to the cave and engraved in his
  mind the lesson that men are dangerous, treacherous, cruel, ungrateful. And
  so it was that Tom, as he stared down on these houses, shivered a little and
  then cast a glance back over his shoulder as men do when they are in
  fear.</p>

  <p>All his past, before the death of his mother and the day his father left
  the city and started into the mountains, was lost behind a veil of
  indistinctness. But he remembered enough to know that his father and mother
  had both suffered at the hands of other men, that there had been poverty in
  their household, that there had been hunger, even. So there was ingrained in
  his mind the belief that men are evil. The first man he had met since the
  death of his father had repaid food and shelter with brutality. The second
  voice he had heard had been of one who kept fierce dogs that had attacked him
  without warning, without justification. In his buckskin trousers there were
  still spots of blood. Ay, that was the cardinal sign of man - bloodshed!</p>

  <p>He shuddered in a strong revulsion.</p>

  <p>Yet, that afternoon, in spite of Jerry's earnest endeavors to stop the
  westward journey and head back toward the home country, he insisted upon
  skirting along the hills to get a better view of all that the valley might
  hold. And, before the day was ended, he saw another proof that man is brute,
  and nothing but brute.</p>

  <p>They passed among the trees to the head of a promontory, a low plateau
  which thrust out into the more level or rolling ground, and from the brow of
  this eminence Tom found himself in view of men - many men. A ranch house with
  shambling barns and outhouses around it had been built just beneath the
  cliff, and now, between the rearmost of the houses and the base of the cliff,
  a dozen men were gathered with their horses, in or around a large corral.
  Several of the men were grouped closely around one of their number who lay
  upon the ground, apparently badly hurt. They were pouring water upon his face
  and chest. But he was not the main object of interest.</p>

  <p>In the center of the corral four men were holding a young bay stallion,
  saddled and blindfolded. He danced restlessly, his head snubbed to the saddle
  of another horse. And instantly Tom connected that empty saddle on the bay
  with the prostrate man outside the fence.</p>

  <p>Presently, the latter arose and staggered to the fence, where he leaned
  feebly. Another rider now advanced, climbed into the saddle, and the others
  grouped as close as possible around the fence to watch while the ropes were
  taken from the stallion and his head was freed of the blindfold.</p>

  <p>There followed one minute of more condensed action than Tom had ever seen,
  even when Jack and Jerry were having a mimic combat, for the bay began to
  leap into the air, tie himself almost literally into a knot, and then land on
  stiff legs. The rider was jolted and jarred from side to side. Suddenly, the
  bay reared and flung himself backward. The yell of the watchers came tingling
  up to Tom on the height. But his fierce heart was all with the horse! Why had
  they united to torture the poor creature?</p>

  <p>The rider had flung himself from the saddle barely in time, but when he
  rose he apparently refused to continue the contest. Yet still the struggles
  of the stallion were not over. A third rider presented himself, distinguished
  by a blue bandanna and a sombrero whose belt gleamed with pure, burnished
  gold. He mounted as the other had done. Once more the battle began, and this
  time it lasted thrice as long. Tom could see that the young stallion had
  grown black with sweat. But he fought on as though he were muscled with
  springs. And, in the end, a leap, a jarring landing, and a spring to the side
  unseated the rider.</p>

  <p>He fell in a cloud of dust, while the tormented horse fled to the farther
  side of the corral and tried to leap to safety beyond the bars. He was roped
  and brought down heavily on his side, and, while he lay there, the dismounted
  man of the blue bandanna approached and quirted the helpless body
  brutally.</p>

  <p>This, however, seemed too much for even the other savages. They drew the
  fellow away, the stallion was allowed to climb to his feet and was led away,
  and the group dispersed.</p>

  <p>But the heart of Tom followed the beautiful bay, for on the morrow, would
  not the torture begin again? And would they not persist until they had broken
  his spirit and his heart? Savagely, he shook his fist at the backs of the
  disappearing men. And Jerry, comprehending the anger, though not its cause,
  stopped in his digging for a ground squirrel and looked up with a growl among
  the trees.</p>

  <p>But after that Tom turned eastward again, and Jerry went joyously in the
  lead. They had both had too much of men! A bright-running trout stream a mile
  away, however, was too great a temptation to them both. There they paused
  while Tom caught their supper. He risked a fire, carefully made of dead wood
  so that there would be as little smoke as possible, and broiled a small part
  of his catch for himself, while Jerry devoured the remainder.</p>

  <p>When that meal was ended, the twilight was descending, and Tom, with a
  filled stomach, found that the vision of the bay still haunted him. It seemed
  to fill his mind, that picture of the horse. He began to remember an old
  mustang which his father had used for mountain work. Even that treacherous
  brute he had loved, for men are born to love horses or to despise them, and
  Tom was one of the former.</p>

  <p>And it seemed to him that, if he could have that magnificent creature in
  the mountains, his happiness would be complete.</p>

  <p>Not to ride, to be sure, for his own legs were good enough to carry him
  where he wished to go; and, when he was tired, there was the exhaustless
  power of that matchless mountaineer, Jerry, to carry him on.</p>

  <p>But how could he take a wild horse from men who were armed with guns?</p>

  <p>That question lay heavily on the mind of Tom as the twilight thickened. He
  sat brooding beside the fire until Jerry began to growl, so great was his
  eagerness for the return journey to twice-traveled fields. But Tom shook his
  head. That very insistence confirmed him in his new desire.</p>

  <p>"The point is," he said to the huge bear, "that I've got to have that
  horse. And if I can't have him, I've got to have one more look at him. Stay
  here, Jerry. I'm going back!"</p>

  <p>It was a command which Jerry understood. He stood still with an almost
  human groan, and Tom turned, drew tight his belt, and started back at a
  run.</p>

  <p>He never walked when he was bent on business. Walking was the gait for
  leisure and careful observation. But he had learned to read even a difficult
  trail while he ran, and now he jogged back through the trees, twisted aside
  into the head of the canyon to his right, and then let out a link and raced
  blithely across the rolling ground until he turned the point of the
  promontory and the ranch houses were in view.</p>

  <p>The instant he saw the first lighted window, he slowed to a walk. He had
  learned from Jerry's mother a lesson of caution which he never forgot. And
  Jerry himself was an alert hunter. He could not cross a clearing, no matter
  how small, without first pausing an instant to take in his surroundings. He
  seemed to carry in the back of his brain a chamber crowded with memories of
  dangers which had come upon his ancestors. He suspected every tree,
  apparently, lest it might turn into a monster.</p>

  <p>There was something of the same manner in Tom as he approached the house.
  He took advantage of every tree. He skulked swiftly down the hollows. He
  crawled on hands and knees over the knolls.</p>

  <p>When he came to the first barn, his caution redoubled. Round it he stole.
  And then he heard men's voices - many of them. A shudder crept down his spine
  as he listened, for the memory of the stranger in his cave was still rank.
  And, never having matched his strength against another man, how could he know
  that even that giant of a man would have been helpless now against his own
  lightning speed of hand and foot and that strange strength with which his
  muscles had been seasoned by those years of exposure and constant exercise?
  All he knew was that he had been helpless in the hands of a man once before,
  and he felt that he would be helpless again.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he went on. He came in view of the house itself, long, low,
  thrown loosely together, with only three lighted windows in its length. These
  were open, and from one of them came the tumult of voices.</p>

  <p>He stole to it and looked in. What he saw was. a group of four men around
  a table playing cards. Each man was flanked with a glass, and there were
  bottles behind the chairs from which, now and again, they poured a trickle of
  amber liquid into their glasses, drank, and played again. The talk came at
  intervals. Sometimes, there was a solemn silence while the cards were sent
  flashing out around the table and the hands were picked up. Then they began
  to push out money toward the center of the table. Some of the cards were
  discarded. Others were drawn, and more money was stacked, all in a deadly
  seriousness. But Tom cast only an idle glance of wonder at their occupation.
  He gave his more serious attention to the faces of the players.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p class="first">And, if he traveled round and round the country, he could
not have found
  four more repulsive faces. Greed, ferocity, cruelty, were ingrained in each.
  It was no practiced eye with which Tom looked upon them, but instinct taught
  him all he needed to know. How different they were from John Parks! The
  surety grew in him that his father had been a different breed of man, a
  single exception. But the rest of the human race were evil, all evil. He felt
  his detestation grow, for how could all of these be compared in worth with
  that beautiful horse he had seen them torturing that day?</p>

  <p>Here the man of the blue bandanna pushed back his chair. His pile of money
  was gone.</p>

  <p>"I'm busted, boys," he said, "but who'll stake me twenty?"</p>

  <p>"On what, Hank?" asked another. "What's your security?"</p>

  <p>"On old Peter," said Hank.</p>

  <p>"Twenty dollars on that hoss?" murmured the other.</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked Hank aggressively.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you," said the other, "Peter is worth something in the
  thousands - or else he ain't worth a cent. And, speaking personal, I say he
  ain't worth a cent!"</p>

  <p>"Hey!" cried Hank. "How come you to talk like that, Bill? D'you ever see a
  hoss with the looks that Peter has?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," responded Bill. "He's got the looks. There ain't no doubt of that.
  But looks ain't what a gent can sit a saddle on. Matter of fact, the man
  ain't born that can ride Peter."</p>

  <p>"That's fool talk!" cried Hank. "Why, anybody can lead Peter around."</p>

  <p>"Who's talking about leading?" answered Bill. "What good does it do a gent
  to have a hoss that he can lead if he can't ride it? And nobody can ride
  Peter. Look at Sam Dunbar. Didn't he try his prettiest on Peter today? But
  after he got throwed he had enough. He wouldn't go back at Peter."</p>

  <p>"Dunbar's nerve is gone," said Hank sullenly.</p>

  <p>"What about your nerve? Why didn't you tackle him after he threw you?"</p>

  <p>Hank sat silent and glared. He was plainly hunting for words but could
  find no retort.</p>

  <p>"You take my advice," said Bill. "Peter has a pile of looks, but that's
  all. All the good he'll do you will be to run up a feed bill. If I had him,
  I'd turn him into dog food pronto."</p>

  <p>Hank sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Boys," he said, "ain't there a one of you that would advance me something
  on Peter?"</p>

  <p>They shook their heads.</p>

  <p>"Yet you all wanted him bad enough when he was running loose. When he was
  roaming through the hills with that gang of mustangs, you all sure enough
  wanted Peter bad. Every man here rode for him. But, when I creased him and
  got him, you say he ain't worth nothing. Is that sense?"</p>

  <p>"Talk for yourself, Hank," they told him. "We don't want him. All he'll do
  for a gent is to bust his neck. He's turning into a killer. That's the worst
  kind - them that are quiet as lambs till they feel a cinch bite into them.
  They ain't no use, ever. You got him rope broke easy, but you'll never break
  him for the saddle. If you want some money, put up your gun. I'll give you
  something for that!"</p>

  <p>Hank sneered.</p>

  <p>"Give up my gat with Joe Saunders in town?" he said fiercely. "I ain't
  that much of a fool!"</p>

  <p>"Then use your gun to turn Peter into dog meat, if you want," said Bill,
  "but don't hold up the game no longer. Your deal, Sam!"</p>

  <p>Hank regarded the others with a concentrated malevolence for a moment, but
  suddenly he jammed his hat upon his head, turned on his heel, and strode from
  the room.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute -" began Bill.</p>

  <p>"Shut up," said Sam. "If he wants to kill the hoss, let him do it before
  the hoss kills him. And that's what it would come to one of these days."</p>

  <p>"But a hoss like Peter -" began Bill.</p>

  <p>"I know," said Sam. "A hoss like Peter looks like a picture, but that's
  all the good he is. He might as well stay on the page of a book. All the good
  he is to make a pile of talk."</p>

  <p>Tom recoiled from the window.</p>

  <p>So that was to be the end of beautiful Peter - a bullet through the head
  and then the buzzards!</p>

  <p>He stole around the house just as the back door of it banged, and Hank
  stepped out into the night and walked straight for the corrals with the speed
  and the decision of a man bent on business. Like a moving shadow, Tom drifted
  behind him.</p>

  <p>In the corral, Hank advanced with a rope, and Tom saw him go directly up
  to Peter. There was no mistaking the horse even in the darkness. That noble
  and beautiful outline had a light of its own.</p>

  <p>Tom wondered to see the great horse submit so calmly to the rope which was
  put around its head. Then Peter was led out from the corral and tethered to
  the fence. A gun gleamed in the hand of Hank.</p>

  <p>"Now, dang your soul," growled Hank, "you've got out to the end of your
  rope, and you're going to be flopped. I've stood a whale of a lot from you.
  Take it by and large, I put in six months getting in a shot at you. And when
  that slug knocked you down without killing you, I sure thought I was going to
  make a pile of money out of you. I figured I had the fastest thing on four
  feet that was running through the mountains. But you ain't done me no good.
  You've got me busted. I'm through with you. And here's the end of your trail.
  I might turn you loose, but I ain't going to let it be said that I had that
  six months' work for nothing."</p>

  <p>The gun raised in a steady hand. And Tom slipped closer. His heart was
  hammering at the top of his throat. He could hardly breathe, so great was his
  fear. There was the knife, to be sure. But he could not strike it into a
  human body - from behind. Something in his heart made that impossible. Yet if
  he grappled that man hand to hand, how could he match the matured strength of
  Hank?</p>

  <p>Desperately, he set his teeth. There was no time to reflect. He leaped
  from behind and caught Hank in his arms.</p>

  <p>To his amazement, the body of Hank seemed to crumple to water!</p>

  <p>Strength? He knew at a touch that he could break the man in two! But the
  sense of power made him gentle. There was only a strangled gasp from Hank as
  the revolver was torn from his hand and he was laid upon the ground. Peter
  snorted and stepped back.</p>

  <p>"Now listen," said Tom, while all his blood was in a riot from that easy
  victory. "Listen to me. If you try to call the others by yelling for them,
  I'll send a slug into you. That'll make one less to follow me. If you even
  try to stand up, I'll shoot. And you can be sure that I won't miss!"</p>

  <p>There was not a word from Hank. His body merely stiffened. But in the
  meantime the possession of that loaded gun meant a world of added power to
  Tom. He took off the heavy cartridge belt from his victim. He buckled it
  around his own hips. He dropped the revolver into the holster. Then he went
  to Peter. But there seemed to be no need for his soothing voice. The strength
  of a rope was a fact which the stallion had learned first of all from his
  contact with men, and, though he might be in terror for his life, he would
  not pull back against it. It had burned into his flesh too often before.</p>

  <p>He stood patiently while Tom unknotted the rope. And, at the first tug of
  the rope against his neck, he stepped out to follow the new master. And that
  act of obedience thrilled Tom with a sudden and strange gratitude, a wealth
  of tenderness. In his heart of hearts he vowed that Peter should never regret
  that step. He sent a last word to Hank.</p>

  <p>"I'm still watching you!" he called softly, then broke into a jogging run.
  Peter came readily at his heels. Once around the edge of the corral, he
  increased the pace to his full speed, and still Peter followed without once
  drawing back on the rope. But, as Tom rounded the edge of the cliff from the
  top of which he had first had a view of the horse, he heard a sudden hubbub
  behind him, and voices shouting, carrying clearly through the mountain night.
  The alarm had been given, and in another moment the pursuit on horseback
  would begin!</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">The temptation was to strain forward still faster, but even
the greyhound
  strength of those mountain-trained legs of Tom, even that almost exhaustless
  lung power, could not sustain a sprint for three miles, and it was fully that
  distance to the head of the canyon where the timber and the rough ground
  would help to slow up the pursuers. So Tom calculated the distance and
  diminished his gait, though it took all his will power to enable him to do
  it.</p>

  <p>As for the danger of capture, he knew nothing of the unwritten law which
  makes horse stealing equally culpable with murder in the West, but no tale
  could have terrified him more than he already was. Dread of death kept him
  running. And now and again he would leap into a sprint involuntarily.</p>

  <p>Behind him came a distant whooping, and then the beating of many hoofs
  again was audible. He cast a glance behind him. There came Peter, the
  stallion, his ears pricking as though he rejoiced in the running, rocking
  along at a lazy canter. Oh, to be mounted on the back of that king of horses!
  Then how he would laugh at pursuit! It would be like adding wings! But far
  away over the starlit canyon floor he could see the horsemen beginning to
  loom.</p>

  <p>And they swept close and closer at a terrific speed. Yet, measuring the
  distance to the woods ahead of him, he knew that he must save his strength.
  There was still an open mile between him and the woods, and even in the woods
  he must still be prepared to run on, for they would spur ahead as fast as
  they could, weaving through the trees.</p>

  <p>That last mile was an untold agony, for a gun barked behind him. It was a
  random shot, but it made Tom leap ahead. His driving legs were numb to the
  knees, to the hips. His lungs were filled with fire. There was not enough air
  in the universe to give him one sweet, fresh breath.</p>

  <p>And how those wild riders behind him were gaining! He began to dread to
  glance back, so much more clearly were they growing upon his eyes. And now he
  threw caution to the winds, and he cast all his power into the last spurt.
  The woods grew up, black and tall. They were like a promise of heaven to Tom,
  with those increasingly loud hoof-beats ringing in his ears. And the
  pursuers, feeling that the race was close, opened with a rattling volley.</p>

  <p>But men cannot shoot straight from horseback, and the bullets flew wild,
  singing around Tom's head, while he raced on with head straining back, with
  mouth gaped wide, with eyes wild, with his long hair blown back from his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>He was lost, he told himself. He could hear the panting of their horses.
  Or was it the breathing of Peter, coming with such maddening ease behind him?
  Then suddenly his eyes cleared. The woods were only a step before him!</p>

  <p>He leaped behind the first trunk. Peter swung into the shadow near by. Tom
  jerked the revolver from the holster and fired blindly at the rushing forms.
  A yell of alarm answered him. The riders split to the right and the left,
  wheeled, and scurried away. He grew weak with relief and fired again - into
  the air. But it brought another volley of curses from the four riders.</p>

  <p>They would circle back and steal into the woods to try to head him off.
  But that was a game at which they would find him hard to beat, unless he had
  lost his cunning in woodcraft. He started on again up the slope, with Peter
  dancing anxiously at his heels, sniffing and snorting at the strange shadows,
  then stealing along noiselessly as the spirit of the wilderness came heavily
  upon his heart with fear. The open hills, the wide plains were the domain of
  Peter. And in this forest darkness, he was glad of company, even if that
  company had to be detested man!</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the lungs of Tom had grown cool. His trembling knees
  regained their strength. Presently, he was swinging along at a brisk gait,
  more himself every moment. He thought of Jerry. The ideal way would be to
  head straight for the upper mountains where horsemen could least easily
  follow. He should ride Jerry and lead the stallion. But he knew that the
  horse would be paralyzed with fear near the grizzly, for all things that
  lived and ran wild dreaded Jerry.</p>

  <p>How could he handle the two together?</p>

  <p>Near the place where he had camped by the brook, he tethered Peter to a
  tree, and the horse cowered close to it, eying in terror the moving shades of
  the woods. Tom went on to the grizzly and found him rooting in the bank of
  the stream. He brought him back within view of the horse.</p>

  <p>The effect on both was exactly what Tom had foreseen. Jerry heaved
  instantly on his hind legs and stood immense, growling. And poor Peter went
  back to the limit of his rope and there crouched like a great cat, overcome
  with nameless terror. If they were to become better acquainted, the night was
  not the time for it. Tom thought of another expedient.</p>

  <p>He loosed Peter from the tree and started on up the hillside briskly - for
  who could say when the pursuers would come upon his trail? He could not
  realize that the night which was such an open book to him was closed to
  ordinary men. Peter followed, knocking his forefeet against Tom's heels in
  his eagerness to get away from Jerry, and Jerry came grumbling and rumbling
  in the distance, a very bewildered and angered bear. Yonder went his human
  friend - master, he could hardly be called. And with Tom wandered what was to
  Jerry simply an ample store of food going on foot. Yet when Jerry pressed
  close, there came from Tom the whistle which to the big bear meant danger
  ahead.</p>

  <p>Half a dozen times he heard that whistle as he drew near. Each time he
  lifted to his hind legs as a wise bear should and sniffed the air for the
  scent of an enemy, but found no trace. Finally he understood that, while Tom
  accompanied the horse, he wished Jerry to stay in the background.</p>

  <p>A bear will sulk exactly as a human being sulks. And when Jerry perceived
  the desire of his friend, he promptly turned around and melted into the
  forest.</p>

  <p>Tom paused and looked back after him in great anxiety. But after a moment
  he went on. He was wise enough to know that it was foolish to attempt to read
  the mind of the grizzly. That cunning fellow might have disappeared in order
  to trail them close at hand, but secretly. Or perhaps Jerry would get ahead
  of them in order that he might watch from cover as they passed. And that was
  exactly what happened, for, when he paused at daybreak upon the top of a
  mountain, he found Jerry on the upper side, though the big fellow instantly
  dropped his head and began to dig in the ground as if he had gone there for
  the sole purpose of finding delectable roots.</p>

  <p>But now, since daylight was come, Tom tethered the horse to a sapling
  around which the grass grew thick and long, and, while the stallion ate, he
  stood back and looked at his prize for the first time.</p>

  <p>What he saw was more than he could have hoped! To be sure, the horse was
  thin. Every rib along his side could be marked, and on his flanks were still
  the crimson signs of whip and spur. He had been most cruelly handled! No
  wonder that he shrank from the lifted hand of Tom! No wonder that his great
  eyes blazed with terror when Tom came near.</p>

  <p>Wild rage boiled up in the heart of the youth. For here was a creature
  intended by nature, surely, to be handled with affection alone, and they had
  tried to beat it into submission. He gloried with a sudden joy in the
  knowledge that at least men had failed to have their will of the horse! For
  his own part, how utterly contented he would be to have this king of the
  plains to watch, to talk to so that the sharp little ears would prick at the
  sound of his voice, to feed until he was sleek and round of barrel. Here was
  companionship. To be sure, if ever he could persuade the stallion to permit
  him to sit on its back - the heart of Tom jumped.</p>

  <p>Then he sat down cross-legged on the grass and drew out from a pouch at
  his side the quantity of crushed, dry corn which he always carried when he
  traveled. He held out a quantity of it in both cupped hands. No matter that
  the stallion, not grown accustomed to the man-food given to horses, sniffed
  it and then backed away, his ears flattened against his neck. The patience of
  Tom was not that of the ordinary man. He had been taught in the school of the
  wilderness. He had learned the endless patience of Jerry, who would dig two
  hours for the sake of a single woodchuck. And, if quiet and gentleness and
  unending endurance would win, Peter should be his horse in the end, body and
  soul.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <p class="first">"Of course," said Gloria, "if you have made up your mind to
believe, no
  one can dissuade you."</p>

  <p>"Don't be disagreeable, Glory," said her father with a frown.</p>

  <p>"I'm trying my level best not to be," said Gloria, "but ever since you
  hunted in Africa you've been entranced by fables," and she smiled as her
  father bit his lip in vexation.</p>

  <p>She was probably the only person in the world who refused to take her
  distinguished father altogether seriously. Others were mightily impressed by
  the reputation of this man who could shoot lions one day and write learnedly
  about them from a biological viewpoint on the next; and who, above all, had
  taken more folklore out of Africa than almost any other human being. But to
  Gloria, John Hampton Themis was first and foremost the father of Gloria.
  Besides, she had not wanted to take this trip into the mountains. At
  eighteen, Paris was infinitely more attractive. And though she had forced
  herself to be amiable when her father insisted that she learn something about
  her own country before she pried into "the truth about Europe," she could not
  help taking out some of her disappointment in such petty badgering as
  this.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, she had found the valley of the Turnbull far more
  interesting than she had expected. And in her blood ran some of her father's
  fiery love of saddle and rifle and the arduous hunting trails. Besides, at
  eighteen Gloria could walk down an average man when it came to mountain
  climbing, and she was a little proud of that fact. Yet Paris now and then
  swam back upon her ken, and when it did, as at the present moment, she could
  not avoid being a little disagreeable.</p>

  <p>Her father had always attempted to convince her by reason and not to
  overwhelm her by the force of parental authority. He sat down to reason
  now.</p>

  <p>"I simply wish to submit the facts to you, my dear," he said. "After you
  have examined them, you can make up your mind for yourself, Glory."</p>

  <p>"Fire away," said Gloria.</p>

  <p>John Hampton Themis glared, then shrugged his shoulders and sat back.</p>

  <p>"I told you yesterday," he said, "the story of the Indian and the man
  whose dogs were killed."</p>

  <p>"I remember it all," she said. "The man heard his dogs raise a clamor as
  though they had scented a bear. But when he went out he found two of the dogs
  stabbed to death and a third with a crushed skull as though a bear had struck
  it. And when they examined the trail the next morning they found that a man's
  moccasined footprints were mixed with those of a huge grizzly. Isn't that
  right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And the deduction is that a man had helped the bear to fight the
  dogs."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? Well, isn't it absurd on the face of it? Besides, all this
  happened six years ago. You know how a story can grow in six years - yes, or
  in six days."</p>

  <p>"Please be reasonable, Glory. There are three honest men who swear to the
  truth of that story."</p>

  <p>"You think that this Indian had actually tamed a grizzly?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? It has been done before. There's the story of Ben Adams. He
  trained one after another. They actually fought for him against their own
  kind."</p>

  <p>"When did Ben Adams live?"</p>

  <p>"Because a thing happened seventy years ago," cried her father, "does that
  turn it into a fable?"</p>

  <p>"Usually," she answered calmly.</p>

  <p>"H'm," he said. "You're in a bad humor today. But I'll convince you in
  spite of yourself that this is a trail worth running down. Let me tell you
  what I've learned in addition."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her graceful shoulders.</p>

  <p>"A day after the exploit of the dogs, a man named Hank Jeffries, a rough
  fellow whom I've seen and talked with, went out to shoot an outlaw mustang, a
  stallion he had captured by creasing. It was a famous horse called Peter. But
  Peter, once captured, proved untamable. No one could sit the saddle on him
  for five consecutive minutes. Hank received several broken ribs and minor
  injuries from various attempts to ride the horse. Finally, he invited three
  famous riders to his ranch. One by one they all tried the horse, and Peter
  won. So in the night Hank went out to shoot the creature -"</p>

  <p>"How terrible! Is that the sort of thing your precious Westerners, your
  romantic cowpunchers, will do? I'd rather shoot a man than a horse."</p>

  <p>"So would a good many cowpunchers. But Hank is not exactly a citizen of
  the finest character. He had a black record. The killing of a horse wouldn't
  be the worst stain on his reputation, I understand. At any rate, he didn't
  kill Peter."</p>

  <p>"Good!" cried Glory.</p>

  <p>Her father smiled at her enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"No, when he raised the gun, a giant leaped on him from behind, took him
  with a terrific grip that crushed the wind out of him, threw him down to the
  ground, tore the gun out of his hand, and threatened to kill him if he
  stirred. Then the stranger took the lead rope of the horse and made off into
  the night - a huge man with long hair which flowed down almost to his
  shoulders. And he ran like the wind. He ran so fast, in fact, that when Hank
  called his friends and they started in pursuit on their horses after only an
  instant - for the horses were saddled and waiting - they could not catch the
  stranger, though he had several miles to run!"</p>

  <p>"That," commented Gloria, "is plainly a fable. You must admit that it
  is!"</p>

  <p>"I went over the ground today," said the great hunter. "Even if they had
  had to capture their horses before they started, even if they had had to
  saddle them in the corrals, it would have required a great runner to get away
  from running horses into the shelter of the woods at the head of the canyon.
  Still, it's possible that a man of iron nerve and iron muscles, a natural
  runner of a race of runners, might have done that very thing. And it has to
  be admitted that this Indian did it. Four men wouldn't lie about such a
  point."</p>

  <p>"They're sure he's an Indian?"</p>

  <p>"Everything points to it - the moccasins in part, because, though a good
  many mountaineers use them, the average white man prefers boots. But, most of
  all, his quiet ways and that long, flowing hair point to an Indian. No white
  man, accustomed to other men, could have gotten along for these six years
  without coming down to mix with society now and then. But this fellow has
  lived inside himself. It is really most remarkable!"</p>

  <p>"But has he been seen at all during these six years?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"Not actually seen, I believe," said the other thoughtfully. "But they
  know that he's around."</p>

  <p>"And haven't they been able to run him down?"</p>

  <p>"No. Several times he's come down from the mountains, however. The spring
  after the stealing of the mustang, a great bundle of beautiful beaver skins
  was brought down in the night and left at the house of Hank without word of
  who had brought them. And it is generally taken for granted that the Indian
  brought them in payment for the horse which he had stolen. He has done the
  same thing at other times. Once the store was broken open in the town of
  Turnbull, yonder, and the next morning one rifle and a great stock of
  ammunition were found missing, but in return there was left a bundle of furs
  worth ten times the value of the stolen goods. On another occasion - you see
  that it must be the same man - a rancher's house was invaded, and a hundred
  pounds of ham and bacon were taken, along with other food and more
  ammunition. But again furs were left in payment."</p>

  <p>"Oh," cried Gloria, "Dad, what a wonderful fellow that hermit must
  be!"</p>

  <p>"That Indian you mean!" said Themis.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, call him that if you choose. But how does he manage to steal so
  many things without being caught?"</p>

  <p>"He has the courage of a fiend," said Themis. "He seems to laugh at the
  possibility of discovery. There are some uneducated people in the valley who
  are beginning to have a superstition that the Indian can actually go
  invisible. Of course, such rumors are bound to spring into the back of
  people's heads. You see, this cunning devil comes always at night. He seems
  to be able almost to see in the dark. And he will enter a house from the rear
  while the inhabitants are in the front of it. He moves as silently as a
  shadow in his moccasins. He takes what he wants, and then he goes. From what
  I can gather, he has committed his robberies about twenty times during the
  past six years, and not once has a soul beside Hank had a glimpse of
  him!"</p>

  <p>"Not a single person?" said Gloria.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there is a poor, halfwitted fellow, a prospector, or one who calls
  himself a prospector," said Themis. "He has a wild tale, but if I were to
  repeat it you'd be convinced that the whole thing is simply a legend."</p>

  <p>"On my honor," said Gloria, "I'm already a convert. I'd give my eyeteeth
  to see this Indian, or whatever he is."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you the yarn, then, though unquestionably there is more whiskey
  than truth in it. He declares that one moonlight night, in the mountains, he
  had made his camp in a hollow, and his blankets were put down behind a big
  boulder. He wakened at midnight with a great moon in the center of a clear
  sky, and when he sat up he saw - don't laugh, Gloria - he saw, he says, an
  immense grizzly bear, twice the size of any he had ever seen, coming down the
  mountainside with a tall long-haired Indian sitting on its back, and behind
  them came a magnificent bay stallion, the most glorious horse he had ever
  laid eyes on, walking along of his free will, without a lead rope attached,
  but saddled, and with a pack behind the saddle.</p>

  <p>The idea was, you see, that the mountain was so steep that the Indian had
  gotten on the back of the bear to make it easier for his horse. A stiff wind
  was blowing from them to the prospector, so that the bear did not scent
  him.</p>

  <p>"And that strange caravan went by in silence. In utter silence, this poor
  halfwit declares. The very hoofs of the horse did not make a sound on the
  rocks. But of course I don't advance this yarn seriously. The idea of a man
  riding a bear is too preposterous. And the idea that a high-strung horse
  would come so near to a grizzly is even more absurd. But I don't need to say
  that some of these simple mountaineers declare that the story must be the
  truth."</p>

  <p>"And I," said Gloria hotly, "am sure that it is the truth! Oh, how I
  should love to see him!"</p>

  <p>"Now," said Themis, "I see that I've touched the romantic vein."</p>

  <p>"You may laugh if you please," said the girl, "but, when you go on the
  trail after him, I'm certainly going to ride with you."</p>

  <p>"You?" cried her father. "Absurd!"</p>

  <p>"Not at all!"</p>

  <p>"But, my dear, this fellow is dangerous!"</p>

  <p>"But he's an honest man, Dad. He pays for all that he takes."</p>

  <p>"You can't take things and then pay for them as you please," said her
  father. "Ask the man whose dogs were killed what he would do if he could get
  a chance to send a bullet into this Indian. Ask Hank, for instance, what he
  would do. And, above all, ask the poor sheriff, whose life has been hounded
  because he can't make the capture. The man who held the office when the
  Indian began these excursions into Turnbull Valley was fairly laughed out of
  office. The second man stood the gaff his whole four years, and when he ran
  again he received exactly twelve votes! And the poor devil who has the job
  now is more to be pitied than despised. Every one of those sheriffs has been
  a capable man, but they can't follow a fellow who seems to be able to make
  his trail disappear at will."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but what of the trails of the horse and the bear?"</p>

  <p>"People around here declare that he can make the trails of all three
  disappear like magic when he pleases. I suppose a hundred hunting parties
  have gone out to get him, equipped with dogs and fast horses and men who are
  expert riflemen. But they have always failed. Think of it! They have failed
  so miserably that they haven't laid eyes on the Indian either by night or
  day, save for Hank and one halfwit, if he may be believed!"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Gloria, "everything that you say convinces me more and more.
  I'm going to ride with you when you hunt him. I only hope one thing, that you
  won't hunt to kill!"</p>

  <p>"Tush," said her father, shrugging his shoulders, "when a man defies
  society, he has to take the consequences. But this time I'm going to run him
  down. It won't be a matter of a day or two or a week or two of running. I'm
  going to stay after this mystery until I have run it to the ground if it
  takes me all the summer. I have the best dogs, the best horses, the best
  guides that money can hire, and I have employed them all indefinitely."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Gloria, "it is plain that you could take me along. I won't be
  a burden."</p>

  <p>"Stuff!" said Themis. "I wouldn't dream of it."</p>

  <p>But, nevertheless, he stared at his daughter with a species of dread. He
  foresaw trouble ahead.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

  <p class="first">Only a rich man could have provided for such a summer. Only
a genius could
  have selected so skilfully those who were to ride with him. But, in the
  entire range of the mountains, Themis could not have found five men better
  fitted to follow a long trail, an arduous trail, a trail which might come to
  a dangerous ending. In the first place, he made sure that every man was known
  for hardihood and skill as a mountaineer, familiar with the Turnbull valley
  and all the mountains of the region surrounding the valley, an expert
  trailer, and, above all, capable of using rifle or revolver with deadly
  effect. Not only that, but he made sure that all his men had shot before at
  human targets. There hardly existed unhung a blacker crew of rascals than the
  five he weeded out of many applicants - for the wages were large and the food
  would be good, and, given those conditions to prevail, he could pick whom he
  would.</p>

  <p>Every man of the five had a record, though some of them had not been in a
  penitentiary. There was Si Bartlett, a little, smiling, inoffensive man very
  fond of talk, with great, mild, brown eyes. Of his forty-five years no less
  than fifteen had been spent in prison in two terms, both for manslaughter;
  and in each instance he had been pardoned before his term was up for the
  simple reason that no warden could believe that a man with such a face, such
  a voice, such a pair of eyes, such gentle manners, could be a murderer except
  by accident. But those who knew declared him to be a matchless and malignant
  fighter, one of those who love danger for its own sake, and bloodshed for the
  same reason. Yet he was appointed second in command by Themis. Character had
  nothing to do with his selections. Results were what he wanted.</p>

  <p>Next came Red Norton, save that Red could hardly be put second to any man.
  He, also, had felt the shadow of a prison close over him. But with nine
  lives, men freely declared outside of courtrooms, he could not have paid for
  all his victims. He was a contrast to Si Bartlett, though just as dangerous.
  What made him less terrible was that his appearance advertised his true
  nature in advance. His huge body, the rank growth of red hair which bristled
  on his face and head, his bold, staring, blue eyes, his blunt manner - all
  announced the professional warrior.</p>

  <p>The third of that noble crew was Dick Walker. Dick was the boy of the
  party. He was apparently just a big, laughing, good-natured child of twenty.
  But, when the pinch came, Dick was cold as ice and cutting as a steel edge.
  Older men who were apt to know predicted a long career and a black one for
  Dick. He had not seen the inside of a prison for the simple reason that no
  jury could pronounce a man with such a face and such ability to laugh guilty
  of murder. For the rest, he was a genius on the trail, as all men admitted,
  and he possessed an uncanny dexterity of hand which made him equally at home
  with a cowpuncher's rope or a cowpuncher's gun.</p>

  <p>Dude Wesson was the cook. His nickname described him. He was a tall, lean
  man, with a starved face. His apparel ever showed signs of consummate care.
  Polish was never missing from his kit, and his boots were shined morning and
  even at noon, to the amazement of those who did not know him. He was none of
  those who allow the face to become covered with a bristle of hairs which is
  shaved only every third day. It was said that he would rather have water for
  shaving than for drinking, even on a desert. His clothes, also, were never
  allowed to fall into disrepair, and a spot upon the trousers meant half an
  hour's work to this fastidious gentleman.</p>

  <p>Naturally, such a man was self-indulgent in the matter of food. His
  fleshless face belied an appetite which was omnivorous. He began early at the
  table, he ate with terrible velocity, and he kept at it long after the others
  were through. And yet, no signs of that voracious gourmandizing appeared in
  his starved body. No one could cook to suit him. Therefore, he cooked for
  himself and the rest. He was self-appointed to the task, and he was forgiven
  his other faults, for the sake of his skill over a camp fire and his genius
  with venison and coffee. Those faults were taciturnity, a temper as uneasy as
  a hair trigger, and a sullen dislike of everyone. He, too, had escaped the
  prison for the reason that he always forced the other man to make the first
  move, trusting to his superior speed of hand, his superior steadiness in
  aiming, to kill his victim at the last instant. And in all his fights he had
  accumulated not a scar. Such was Dude Wesson.</p>

  <p>The fifth and last of the party was no other than Hank Jeffries. He was
  the least famous of the lot, but he was taken along partly because he knew
  the mountains better than the student knows his book, and partly because he
  was inspired by a prodigious hatred for the Indian. He had never forgiven
  that night assault. He had never forgiven the theft of the stallion. It
  mattered not that he had been on the verge of killing the animal. It was only
  more of a rankling wound in his malevolent soul that another should have been
  able to use that which he himself had not been able to master. And, day and
  night, he dreamed of the battle which must at last take place between himself
  and the Indian.</p>

  <p>To that end, he kept himself in constant fettle. He had begun a soberer
  life, because he did not wish to be taken unawares if the opportunity came.
  Day by day he practiced with his guns to make sure that he could make the
  best of the first opening. He had invested the last money he could borrow on
  his ruined ranch to buy two fast horses which should be ready for the
  pursuit. And, when he learned of the purpose for which John Hampton Themis
  was organizing the posse, he had come to the great man and begged with tears
  in his eyes to be granted the privilege of accompanying the party. At least
  he could make himself useful on account of his skill in the handling of
  dogs.</p>

  <p>And Themis took him for the last reason as well as for the others which
  have been mentioned. Even if Hank was not cast according to the heroic mold
  of the others, he was a man of talent, and the party could not get on without
  his skill. He had "learned" dogs in his childhood, and he had never forgotten
  the lessons. Not that he particularly loved them, but he knew their ways, and
  he could handle them in the field.</p>

  <p>This was the more important to Themis because not the least important part
  of his posse consisted of the dogs. He had even sent to a distance and waited
  a week to secure a set of bloodhounds, and four of these long, low-geared,
  soft- eyed beasts were finally brought to him. Their noses were to be the
  first agency through which the trail would be unwound and the riddle
  solved.</p>

  <p>But they were not the major portion of the dog pack. In addition, there
  were half a dozen mongrels of all sizes, shapes, and colors, but all valuable
  dogs on a bear trail where intelligence is needed. And it is an old tale that
  the nameless cur is the one with the peerless set of brains. Furthermore, the
  dog pack had its fighting, swift-running portion, consisting of eight big
  hounds with a strong strain of greyhound mixed with heavier and more powerful
  breeds. Two of them could pull down a timber wolf, for they were trained to
  fighting tactics. Four of them could worry a bear to death if they caught it
  in open country, and the eight could destroy any animal that walked if given
  a fair opportunity. Their noses were not altogether trustworthy, but when the
  trail was hot they could follow it well enough, and, the moment they had
  sight of the quarry and could get their heads up, they were off like eight
  streaks of murder bent on business.</p>

  <p>There was another purpose for which those dogs could be used. While the
  bloodhounds were dawdling along the trail, untangling it slowly, but with the
  surety of death, these swift hounds would kill enough food for the entire
  pack. So long as there were rabbits in the mountains through which they
  trailed, there would be no need of worrying about the food of the pack.</p>

  <p>Such was the pack with which Themis stood prepared to start on his
  journey. As for horses, there were two of the finest sort for each man. Hank
  Jeffries had his own mounts, and each of the other four had a fast horse.
  Their auxiliary mounts alone had to be furnished by Themis, and he bought
  them regardless of expense. Altogether, he had invested a pretty penny in
  that expedition before the news came which started it on the trail.</p>

  <p>That news came suddenly by night. Into the very town of Turnbull itself
  the marauder had come, opened the store, and taken out a new and fine saddle.
  And, on this occasion, he left no payment of furs. It might be that he had
  run short in his supply. It might be that he had decided that it was nonsense
  to pay for what he could take without making an exchange. The probability was
  that, before the year was out, he would bring down something in payment. The
  storekeeper was willing to wait. He had already done profitable business with
  this strangely generous being. But the community was not willing to wait.
  These dips out of the mountains by the Indian, so often repeated, had made
  the town a laughingstock. And the next morning three distinct parties started
  on the trail.</p>

  <p>The sheriff and his posse made up one. There was another, consisting of
  independent, irate citizens who had nothing better to do. And the third party
  was that of Themis himself. On the floor of the store was found a crudely
  made pair of moccasins which had been discarded in favor of a shopmade brand.
  Those discarded moccasins were given to the dogs to establish the scent, and
  straightway the bloodhounds raised their mellow call and started away. They
  wound around behind the village where the prints showed the marauder had
  walked leisurely. They came to the open, where he had begun to run with an
  amazingly long and regular stride. From that point he had darted across to
  the hills behind the Jeffries place. And in the trees there they found the
  spot where he had left his horse. Through the steep hills the three parties
  worked in unison, these grim and silent men. But presently the fugitive had
  descended into the more open and rolling country and had fled north.</p>

  <p>And on that section of the trail the better horses of the Themis party
  quickly told the tale of their worth. All day they raced north, and long
  before nightfall, as the trail veered sharply to the left and entered the
  mountains again, the sheriff's posse and the group of townsmen were left far
  out of sight to the rear.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

  <p class="first">At the first steep hillside they noticed a peculiarity. The
man had
  dismounted from the horse and had struggled up the ascent on foot. Among
  those ragged rocks, he had evidently figured that he could climb far better
  than his horse, and he took the burden of his weight out of the saddle.
  Themis gave his order instantly, and his men came grumbling out of the
  saddle. They were fellows who lived in the stirrups, every one of them. But,
  when they had struggled to the top of the incline, they appreciated the value
  of that order, for their horses were in good condition, not half so winded as
  if they had been under the pull of reins with a weight in the saddle during
  the labor.</p>

  <p>It was a comparatively freshened lot of horses which now took up the
  journey across a rough, broken, upper plateau. But here another trail joined
  that of the horse. Hitherto, the bloodhounds had run steadily in the lead.
  But now the entire pack surged into the lead and left the bloodhounds far
  behind,</p>

  <p>"Bear!" cried Hank Jeffries. "They've picked up a bear trail."</p>

  <p>And, sure enough, as they crossed a damp place near a natural spring which
  welled out of the ground, they saw the huge prints of a grizzly, the largest
  prints which Themis had ever seen. And his heart leaped. All the story rushed
  back upon his brain, and here was the proof of it. Horse tracks and bear
  tracks went side by side.</p>

  <p>But now the twilight was beginning, and he ordered a halt. It might well
  be that with a single drive tomorrow they could run down the fugitive, but
  for that purpose it was far better that they should be rested, man and beast.
  So they camped beside a brook.</p>

  <p>Hank Jeffries took the hounds, hardly touched with fatigue by the day's
  work, to run down what he could in the hills near by. For the rest of the
  men, Dude Wesson took command and began giving orders sharply as soon as
  their horses had been hobbled and turned out to graze. With brief, sharp
  words he ordered one to arrange stones for the fire, he commissioned two to
  cut wood, and another was directed to help with the preparation of the food.
  And all obeyed without a murmur, for who does not stand in terror of the
  cook?</p>

  <p>Themis himself made a point of taking up his share of the work, though it
  was long since he had spent such a day in the saddle, and he was thoroughly
  fagged. And, in a few moments, the fire was blazing, and food began to steam.
  Suddenly, Dude Wesson straightened beside the fire and pointed a stiff arm
  down the slope, then turned to his work again without a word. And Themis,
  looking in the designated direction, saw Gloria come riding toward them.</p>

  <p>He was mute with wonder and anger. On she came! And, where the up-pitch
  began, she dismounted, just as he had made his men dismount. Up the slope she
  climbed as briskly as any youth could have done. On the edge of the plateau
  she mounted and came to them at a swinging canter. She dismounted at a little
  distance, unstrapped a pack behind her saddle, and unsaddled and hobbled her
  horse and turned it to graze with the rest. Then she came in, carrying the
  pack slung over her shoulder, the heavy saddle on the other arm.</p>

  <p>"Glory!" cried her father, finding his tongue at last. "What on earth has
  come into your head? Have you gone mad?"</p>

  <p>"Never used better headwork," said Gloria mildly. "If I'd started out with
  you from town, you'd have sent me back by force, so I simply trailed you at a
  distance. It was very easy and perfectly safe. Not one of your entire gang
  looked behind during the trip. If the Indian had wanted to, he could have
  come in behind you and traveled along in perfect safety. I was in plain view
  twenty times. And, now that I'm this far away from civilization, Dad, you
  certainly can't send me back through mountains infested with wild men!"</p>

  <p>Themis groaned as the truth of what she had said came home to him.</p>

  <p>"Glory," he said bitterly, "I've spoiled you all your life. And this is
  the reward of my labor. But - don't you see? I hired these fellows for a man
  trail. Do you think they can be bothered taking care of a woman in the midst
  of their other work?"</p>

  <p>She jerked up her chin.</p>

  <p>"Have I asked to be cared for?" she said hotly. "Not by any means. I've
  made up my own pack. I haven't taken a thousand pounds of tinned stuff along,
  as you've done, to kill your horses. I've cut myself down to essentials. I
  have a rifle and matches and salt and flour. I'll kill my own meat."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she threw down a newly killed and cleaned rabbit.</p>

  <p>"I'll make my own living, and I'll carry my own burdens. And if Mary Anne
  can't hold up her end with my weight on her back, I'll walk home!"</p>

  <p>She turned and whistled to Mary Anne. The dainty-footed chestnut tossed up
  her head and whinnied a soft response.</p>

  <p>"Heaven help me!" and Themis sighed. "The man was never born who could
  talk you down."</p>

  <p>"Besides," said Gloria suddenly, "I don't think the men are so disgusted
  with me. Are you, Mr. Wesson?"</p>

  <p>The unexpected appellation of "Mister" was a shock to Dude Wesson. He
  looked up with a scowl from his cookery. He found Gloria walking straight
  toward him. He got up and removed his hat - to rub his head. And suddenly the
  scowl melted from his face. A smile trembled like a frightened stranger on
  his lips, and he nodded.</p>

  <p>"I guess you ain't going to be much in the way," said Dude graciously and
  returned, with a slightly heightened color, to his work.</p>

  <p>John Hampton Themis simply filled his pipe and sat down to think and to
  watch. He had become a great deal of a philosopher since Gloria reached young
  womanhood. He had even referred to her as a "boiled-down education, hard to
  swallow but good for the insides." He thought of that now as he watched her
  go down the slope to join the wood gatherers. There she wasted no time in
  greetings but picked up a discarded ax and presently was swinging it with a
  fine and supple strength. Even the abysmal brute, Red Norton, paused to
  observe her workmanship. And he found no fault with her. She was like Si
  Bartlett. She made up in skill what she lacked in power of body. She could
  send the ax home within a hair's-breadth of her aim. And Red grunted with
  approval. And fact, in sheer hand magic, there was only one member of the
  party who excelled her, and that was the smiling and amiable young
  man-killer, Dick Walker.</p>

  <p>A new thought came to Themis as he watched. She might be the influence
  which would keep the whole party cheerful on the trail, and men who laugh at
  their work can work three times as well as in a gloom of serious endeavor.
  Laughter clears the brain. For the rest, she would be as safe among these
  chosen villains as among men of her own kin.</p>

  <p>She insisted on making her own camp fire and cooking her own food, and she
  roasted her single portion and ate it before the others were half finished.
  Then she came over to join their circle.</p>

  <p>It was a most formal crowd. Every man there had been accustomed to lord it
  over his fellows in whatever society he found himself, but here were four
  with equally sinister reputations, and a fifth not far behind them.</p>

  <p>"If it ain't too much trouble," terrible Red Norton would say, "I'll have
  to be bothering you for that salt, Dick."</p>

  <p>"Here you are," Dick would answer. "Just watch your plate, will you, Si?
  I'm going to get up, and I don't want no dust to be blowing into your
  chuck."</p>

  <p>They would forget some of this formality later on, but in the meantime it
  was stilted conversation until Gloria threw in a bomb by asking how long they
  thought it would be before the Indian was run down. Straightway, each man
  raised his head with a grim smile. There was not one of the crew who did not
  feel that he could run any human being to the ground. But, now that five
  formidable trailers were assembled on fast horses, to say nothing of Themis
  himself, and with the assistance of that pack of dogs, they regarded their
  outfit as an irresistible juggernaut. And they said so freely, each handing
  the praise deftly to the others.</p>

  <p>"If a gent was to ask me," said Hank Jeffries, "how long it would take
  gents like Dude Wesson and Dick Walker to run down their man, I'd say it
  would be pretty pronto. But when you got Red Norton throwed in, and when you
  got Si Bartlett on top of all them, I say that the Indian ain't going to keep
  a whole skin more'n tomorrow about sunset time."</p>

  <p>But Gloria shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I can't help doubting," she said. "If I could follow you so easily, why
  can't the Indian get away from you just as easily?"</p>

  <p>It was a disagreeable and new phase of the subject, and it was promptly
  abandoned for more cheerful viewpoints. And, half an hour later, the whole
  party was rolled in blankets.</p>

  <p>For every member of the hungry crew, the night passed like a second.
  Suddenly, they heard the deep, bass voice of Dude Wesson grumble: "Turn out,
  everybody. It's pretty near sunup. Is this a picnic, maybe? Are we going to
  get started about noon? Hook onto an ax, a couple of you, and gimme some
  wood. I can't cook with air. Bartlett, are you too proud to peel potatoes?
  This ain't a hunting party, it's a rest camp!"</p>

  <p>Those sullen exhortations began the day with a rush. Gloria saddled Mary
  Anne and cantered over the crest of the hill to a stream on the farther side.
  There she made her toilet and gave the men freedom to start the day with the
  customary groans and curses. By the time she came back, all was cheerful
  bustle, and the breakfast fire was blazing bright. The east was red with
  sunrise. The upper mountains were gleaming with light. And Paris, for the
  first time since she left New York, was banished from the mind of
Gloria.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

  <p class="first">There followed three hours of serious labor through the
mountains, and
  then the bloodhounds came to the bank of a creek and were silenced by the
  failure of the scent. They ran whining here and there. One of them swam
  across to the farther bank, but even there the trail could not be gained.</p>

  <p>"He knows we're after him," said Hank Jeffries briefly. "Here's where the
  fun begins."</p>

  <p>"No trouble at all," called Themis cheerily. "He might cover his own
  trail, but he can't cover the trail of his horse and a grizzly bear.
  Impossible! Take the bloodhounds across. You send a pair of them upstream,
  and I'll take another pair down, and we'll pick up the trail directly."</p>

  <p>It was done, but no trail developed. They had been a mile upstream and a
  mile or more down it, and there was no result! Hank Jeffries shook his head,
  cursing softly. The others were equally amazed.</p>

  <p>"But, Dad," cried Gloria, "he can't have made the trails disappear into
  thin air!"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk, please," snapped her father. "We have work to do. We'll try
  this bank of the creek, Hank."</p>

  <p>So up the nearer bank of the creek they worked the hounds until, as on the
  farther side, they were stopped by waterfalls where the fugitives could not
  have gone. They reassembled at the starting place, the point where horse and
  bear had entered the water.</p>

  <p>"And in the meantime," groaned Themis, "the Indian has all this time
  gained. We'll never run him down today! Bartlett, what do you suggest?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. It was Dick Walker who offered the only possible
  advice.</p>

  <p>"He's taken some way out of the water where he wouldn't leave a trail," he
  said. "Put out the dogs on each side of the creek a hundred yards away from
  it, and see what you strike."</p>

  <p>That was done, and half an hour later one of the hounds raised the
  familiar wail and headed back into the mountains at a place five hundred
  yards up the stream. The Indian had doubled back into the higher ground. All
  the party scurried to the spot. There were the trails leading out of a clump
  of bushes. And, now that the scent was located, the track of the hunted man
  was instantly evident.</p>

  <p>He had gone up the creek to a broad, flat-topped rock which was close to
  the shore. From this he had made a long leap, clearing the bank of the creek
  and landing seven or eight feet away in the center of a clump of shrubbery,
  the outer part of which still stood up and revealed no break. From that place
  he had jumped onto a similar clump, and so to another, until he cleared a
  considerable distance from the water. And then he had struck out. In the
  meantime, he had called the horse and the bear, and these animals,
  marvelously trained, must have followed in his exact footsteps. Here he had
  mounted again, and the trail went off up the slope.</p>

  <p>But a full hour had been wasted in picking up the broken trail, and in
  that time the pursued man, even if he chose to go leisurely, could have
  placed five miles of mountain going between himself and the hunters. It was
  plain that only the greatest good luck could bring them up with the fugitive
  that day. But they struck out resolutely. All of them were too seasoned to
  the trail to be greatly cast down by a single disappointment, and, though
  Gloria felt at once that the task was hopeless, she could not but admire the
  way the rest of them went ahead.</p>

  <p>"The point is," said her father, falling back beside her, "that this is a
  campaign, not a pursuit. And we're going to stick to the campaigning until
  we've cornered him."</p>

  <p>They dipped over the next ridge and into a valley. Rather, it was a gorge,
  sloping easily down the side from which they had come, but cut to a cliff on
  the opposite wall. The hounds were heading up the valley along this wall when
  there came a sharp spat of a bullet on a rock before them, and, as they
  recoiled, half a dozen shots followed, crowding them back, though all went
  scatheless. Their mellow voices fell away to sharp squeals of terror overcome
  by the sounds of the reports of the rifle as these came lagging behind the
  swift bullets. For a moment the air was thick with the echoes of the gun, the
  voices of the dogs, and the angry and astonished shouts of the men as they
  scattered for cover behind the boulders.</p>

  <p>And there they cowered, anxiously searching the top of the cliff for the
  marksman. No sign of him was there. Five or ten minutes of worry followed.
  Suddenly, Gloria stood up from behind her rock.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see?" she explained. "He isn't shooting to kill. It was
  beautiful marksmanship. But he sent the bullets just ahead of the dogs each
  time. He didn't want to kill even the dogs, and it stands to reason that he
  wouldn't touch human beings. He simply wanted to show us that we were at his
  mercy!"</p>

  <p>The posse came out, one by one, and resumed their places in the saddle in
  a sullen silence. Plainly, Gloria was right. And, having run into such an
  ambush, they were ashamed to continue the trail after being at the mercy of
  their enemy. But the shame wore off and was succeeded by hot anger. He had
  been playing with them, declared Red Norton, pushing his horse into the lead
  at the heels of the bloodhounds. And he, Red Norton, would go ahead and prove
  that no man in the universe could make a fool of him once without living to
  be sorry for it.</p>

  <p>And the others declared that this was the right attitude, and they went on
  more vigorously than ever through the rough country, pushing the dogs with an
  ever increasing energy. Gloria took the first opportunity to have a serious
  talk with her father.</p>

  <p>"For my part," she said, "I think the best thing would be to let him go
  his way. For one thing, he has a sense of humor.</p>

  <p>Imagine him lying up there among the rocks and laughing when we heard his
  bullets and tumbled off our horses to get behind the rocks! And a man who has
  a sense of humor can't be really bad."</p>

  <p>"He has an educated sense of humor, then," said Themis, who was irritated
  in soul and body by a badly sunscorched neck. "He has a sense of humor which
  makes me want to force him to laugh on the other side of his face."</p>

  <p>"I admit," and Gloria chuckled, "that you weren't exactly an heroic figure
  when you tumbled in behind that boulder."</p>

  <p>"Confound it, Glory," he protested, "you'll never forget that. If I ever
  talk of hunting between this and my death day, you'll trot out the story of
  how I ran for cover. This bit of work has been laid out, and it has to be
  completed."</p>

  <p>"But he has made fools of all of us," said Gloria.</p>

  <p>"He has had luck," admitted her father grudgingly, "but it's nonsense to
  think that one man, no matter how well he may know these mountains, can dodge
  such a crew as I have brought together - at least, for any length of
  time."</p>

  <p>"And when he's cornered, what crime will he be tried for?"</p>

  <p>"Horse stealing."</p>

  <p>"A horse he paid for!"</p>

  <p>"Ask Hank Jeffries if he agreed to take any payment. No, my dear, a man
  can't go about taking what he pleases and paying what he pleases. And how
  will he account to the man whose dogs he killed?"</p>

  <p>"But I say," said Gloria, summing up in a woman's fashion, "that he's done
  nothing wrong. I pity him!"</p>

  <p>Themis did not care to argue. Two hours later, they ran into another trail
  problem which had been neatly constructed around a creek, and, even though
  they had already had a symptom of the tactics of the fugitive, it took
  another hour to unravel the difficulty.</p>

  <p>Yet they struck into the trail again through the late afternoon, and when
  they camped at sunset it was a disgruntled, weary party. Gloria, however, had
  enjoyed the day thoroughly, for she rode carelessly along, with no thought of
  the fugitive in her brain, with no desire to overtake him. Her mind was
  simply filled with the beauty of the mountains through which they were
  traveling. And those rough-headed peaks against the tender blue of the sky,
  those thickly forested little valleys, with the white crash of a waterfall
  streaking the mountainside, and the pure sapphire of a still lake below -
  these were the things which filled up her eyes so that sometimes she broke
  into song. And, as they climbed closer to the huge, naked region above timber
  line, with a colder and purer air, and with the horses laboring more heavily,
  her spirits rose.</p>

  <p>To be happy is a wearying thing. And when she fell asleep that night, it
  was to fall into a profound slumber. Yet even that slumber was stirred with
  dreams, and they were dreams of the purest delight - of walking through
  meadows where strange and delicately scented flowers bloomed, flowers whose
  names she could not tell; of listening to the liquid voices of streams; of
  breathing an air which was an intoxication of enjoyment.</p>

  <p>She wakened to find that one part of her dream lingered into the daylight
  as a truth. Yonder was the tall form of Dude Wesson booming out his call to
  rise for the work of the day. But her blanket and the ground around her head
  were covered with flowers from the summits - forget-me-nots and daisies and
  goldenrod and silver and blue columbine and other flowers of delicate
  colorings and exquisite fragrances which were new to her. She swept up an
  armful of them. They were already slightly withered where they had lain on
  the dry blanket, but, where they had been placed on the ground about her
  head, there was first a layer of damp moss so that they might be preserved.
  She gazed in wonder and delight.</p>

  <p>Which of the men could have done this thing? Which of the strange and
  apparently hard-hearted fellows could have been capable of that dainty
  tribute? Which of them, apparently all fast asleep before she closed her
  eyes, could have risen and worked for an hour or even more to collect these
  prizes? For there was no sign of a blossom near the camp.</p>

  <p>There was only one possibility - Dick Walker. But, even as her glance
  fastened upon Dick, she saw him tilting a flask to his lips. He was taking
  his regular morning bracer before he could gain the strength to open his eyes
  and begin the day's work. No, such a man as Walker could not have done
  it.</p>

  <p>And who else was there? The sunburned neck and the hard ride certainly
  removed her father from the list of possibilities, even if he could ever have
  been suspected. She sat amazed while the deep voice of the cook suddenly
  thundered: "Those dogs, Jeffries - you got to watch 'em, or I quit as a cook.
  They've swiped a whole side of bacon - or pretty near a whole side!"</p>

  <p>That announcement brought the other men in a cluster about him. Furiously,
  he pointed out where the meat was taken.</p>

  <p>"But look here, Wesson," said Themis at last, "is it like a hungry pack of
  dogs to steal one piece of meat out of a hamper and leave another behind? And
  do dogs ordinarily close a cover they have lifted?"</p>

  <p>All stood aghast. And the girl drew the flowers closer, breathless with a
  wild surmise.</p>

  <p>"A man stole it? But what use would any of us have for bacon?" began Si
  Bartlett. Suddenly, he cried in a shrill voice: "Good Lord, you don't mean to
  say that the Indian came right down to our camp last night? That he was here
  among us?"</p>

  <p>"However," said Themis, "we'll find out. Start the hounds, Hank."</p>

  <p>Jeffries loosed the bloodhounds. They nosed the old trail carelessly,
  circled away, and suddenly struck a fresh one which darted straight up a
  steep slope covered with shrubs.</p>

  <p>"By the gods!" roared Red Norton, who had gone to explore. "Here's where
  the hound came, and here's where he crouched down and looked us over, right
  behind the boulder near where Miss Themis was sleeping. And - how come all
  these flowers?"</p>

  <p>"I found them all around me when I woke up," said the girl. "And - oh,
  Dad, what a strange and beautiful thing it was for him to do!"</p>

  <p>"Strange and beautiful nonsense!" exclaimed her father.</p>

  <p>"Indian foolishness is what I'd call it. But, good heavens, how did he get
  into camp among all these dogs? Did he turn himself into a ghost?"</p>

  <p>One by one, the men came and took up the flowers. Hank Jeffries was away
  whistling in the hounds.</p>

  <p>"When I get him," said Dick Walker softly, "I'll take these flowers out of
  his back."</p>

  <p>He darted at the girl a keen side glance - no more. Yet it was eloquent of
  the truth that poor Dick was a victim where many another man had fallen
  before him, and where many a one would fall in the time to come. And Gloria
  saw and knew and understood. What girl, innocent as she may be, does not? She
  was more interested, however, in the black frown which had overclouded the
  brow of her father. He stared at her with a sort of terror.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said, "I'll stay by this trail if it leads down to Hades. This
  nonsense has to be stopped. And after this we'll keep a watch around our
  camp."</p>

  <p>But the others said nothing at all. And breakfast was eaten in silence,
  for this last trick had been too much for the hardiest of them. They had been
  made fools of the day before. But to have their camp visited in the middle of
  night, to have food stolen from under their noses, to have a sort of silent
  flirtation started with a girl who was under their protection, and all this
  by the very man whose life they were hunting - that, indeed, was too
  much!</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

  <p class="first">Compared to this third day, the work of the preceding days
was a mere
  nothing. In the first place, the trail led straight to a cliff, or what was
  almost a sheer rise of rock. The dogs could make it easily enough, and so
  could the men, but it was folly to attempt to get the horses up that
  murderous ascent. Yet up that very place Peter had been brought! Themis and
  Si Bartlett climbed far enough up the rocks to make sure. They saw the marks
  which the hoofs of the big horse had made as, with a daring and nimbleness
  unaccountable in a horse, he had worked to the top. He had made use of ledges
  and small footholds which even a mountain sheep might have considered twice
  before using.</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it but to marvel at the prowess of Peter and to take
  their own horses around a four-mile trail in order to come to the top of the
  summit. And there, to their consummate fury, they found that the daring
  fugitive had waited until they were well committed to the roundabout way, and
  men he had traveled down the edge of the cliff and taken another and easier
  course to the ground. Even so, it was incredible that a horse should have
  made the descent. And it had been done at considerable risk. Thrice they saw
  marks, which proved that he had slid into the danger of death in getting down
  to the bottom of the gorge beneath. But down he had gone, while the saddle
  and the pack, perhaps - since nothing seemed impossible to this miraculous
  trainer of wild beasts - had been carried by the grizzly.</p>

  <p>But, no matter how the riddle was explained, it remained necessary for
  them to retrace their steps and to take the roundabout way down to the level
  going once more. Two precious hours had been consumed by the climb and the
  descent and the unraveling of that trail problem before the bloodhounds
  struck onto the trail again.</p>

  <p>But now they followed it with utter indifference. Indeed, ever since the
  morning they had done their work as though weary of it, and as for the
  mongrels and the big, fighting hounds, they lagged in the rear or coursed
  rabbits and would not pay the slightest attention to the work in hand.</p>

  <p>Hank Jeffries had the only possible explanation. He declared that when the
  Indian came into camp the preceding night, he had managed to make friends
  with the entire pack. That explained the silence in which they had permitted
  him to come and go. That explained their negligence on the trail.</p>

  <p>"Because," said Hank, "a dog is like any other critter. It works a pile
  better when it figures that it's after something it would like to chew or
  tree. But these dogs, they ain't got no interest in the Indian. They've seen
  him, they've nosed him, and they've been patted by him, most like. Maybe he
  brought in something for them to eat. I dunno how he done it. The Lord only
  knows! I'd of figured that Simpkins dog to chew up any man that tried to come
  near him. Look at me. I been with him most a week, now, but I can't put a
  hand on him. He's a regular killer. We ain't handling ordinary things with
  this Indian. He's got a sort of bad medicine. But I'll do the best I can to
  get the hounds worked up to the trail."</p>

  <p>He lived up to his word. He was indefatigable in his efforts. But he could
  not make them run a hundred feet ahead of him on the trail before their heads
  would come up and they would start idling and playing with one another, and
  looking back to their master as though they wondered what on earth was the
  purpose in continuing on that course.</p>

  <p>Such trailing meant slow work. By noon they had traveled hardly ten miles
  from their starting point. Si Bartlett summed up the result of their combined
  efforts: "We ain't done enough to keep that Peter hoss warm!"</p>

  <p>In the afternoon they tried to rush the trail, relying simply upon their
  ability as trailers by the eye, but after an hour they gave up the effort.
  Before that time was ended they struck a neat problem in the midst of some
  granite and shrubs, a tangle of which they could not make a head until the
  dogs had been persuaded to unravel it.</p>

  <p>And, just as they were heading along at a brisk gait for the first time in
  the day, they struck another murderous slope. This time they managed to go up
  it, but it was slow, slow work, and they had to take a horse at a time, which
  meant two trips for the entire party. They found themselves in a sort of
  badlands at the top of the rise. And, worst of all, night was coming on,
  horse and man were weary, and there was no water.</p>

  <p>Bartlett and Jeffries made a short excursion on two sides, ranging ahead,
  and reported that they had come on no sign of water in any direction. So
  there was nothing for it but to accept the discomfort of a dry camp.</p>

  <p>They had water enough in their canteens for themselves and their cookery,
  but there was nothing for the horses, and the poor creatures, bone dry from
  their labors of the afternoon, soon lost interest in the few blades of grass
  which they could find among the rocks. They stood around with their heads
  down and their eyes dull.</p>

  <p>What talk there was that night around the camp fire consisted of
  monosyllables and grunts. Every man was so thoroughly disgusted with himself
  that he wanted to take out his grievance on his neighbors. And Themis was
  momently in fear that a fight would be started. But a natural reserve, and
  the fact that every man present was known to be an expert with a gun,
  deterred them.</p>

  <p>So, finally, that wretched evening was closed by sleep. Only Si Bartlett
  was left awake to stand guard over them and prevent a visitation such as that
  which they had received the preceding night. He was to keep the watch until
  midnight, and then Red Norton would relieve him.</p>

  <p>Silence dropped over the camp; even the dogs did not so much as whimper,
  so great was their weariness. But it was not an unbroken night of sleep. A
  wild shout wakened them, and then there was a rush of hoofs, snorting, and
  shrill neighing.</p>

  <p>The campers jumped to their feet in time to see their entire herd of
  horses, with one exception, disappearing around the shoulder of a hill, and
  behind them was a wild figure of a man with long hair blown out behind his
  head and riding a beautiful stallion. Before a single shot could be fired, he
  had disappeared in the moonshine behind the hills, and the roar of hoofs tore
  away into distance, striking up loud echoes which slowly died away.</p>

  <p>No man stirred to follow. To pursue such a flight on foot would be like
  attempting to climb a rainbow to the heart of heaven or putting a saddle on a
  snowslide. The horses were gone with the single exception of Mary Anne, and
  even she was working to follow as fast as her hobble would permit her.</p>

  <p>Gloria caught her and brought the good mare back. On her return she found
  that the rest of the men were gathered around Red Norton.</p>

  <p>He had been found thrown behind a rock, tied hand and foot, with his own
  lariat so that he could not stir a muscle, and so thoroughly gagged that he
  had almost choked before he was delivered. He was still gasping and choking
  and clearing his throat. When he stood up, his face was purple with rage, his
  voice husky, and his wild eyes roved around in search of a victim.</p>

  <p>But not a word of explanation would he offer. Only, when Hank Jeffries
  rashly asked him if he had fallen asleep, a torrent of abuse broke forth.</p>

  <p>"D'you think I'm a fool?" thundered Red Norton. "Fall asleep? I was as
  wide awake as I am now, wider awake than you could ever get. But when he -
  I'll trail him if it takes the rest of my life. But I'll trail him alone. I
  don't want no squareheads and halfwits along with me. I work better
  alone!"</p>

  <p>It was too much for Hank Jeffries. His answer was like a flash of fire.
  But Themis stepped between them and struck down Norton's drawn gun. He
  stepped between them at a vital risk of his own life. It was something Gloria
  would never forget, that picture of her father, perfectly calm, his voice low
  and controlled.</p>

  <p>"There's no use quarreling because we're beaten," he said. "There's no
  point in you being ashamed for what's happened, Norton. Any man in the world
  may be surprised by a fellow who seems to be able to turn himself into a
  shadow. If anyone has cause to regret this night, I am he, I think. I'm going
  to pay every one of you his own price for the horse he has lost. You
  understand? And I'll do it without regret. I'm not dissatisfied with the men
  who have made this trip with me. The trouble has been that we've tried to
  follow a most extraordinary man as though he were a common mountaineer,
  whereas he's a genius in his own way. The next time we take the trail, we'll
  start out with just the same company. I wouldn't replace a single man who has
  made the trip. And I intend to start again, I assure you. If we are beaten a
  second time, I'll start a third. My patience is endless. I'm going to see
  this mysterious fellow face to face - unless the rest of you want to give
  up?"</p>

  <p>The answer was a veritable roar of dissent. They would stay with him. They
  would stay with such a generous and open-minded employer to the end of time.
  And they would sooner keep on the trail at their own expense than give it up,
  for their honor was pledged to find the Indian and hang him to a tree in
  proof that they had found him.</p>

  <p>So much for the enthusiasm of the moment; but, as the day began, the
  rising of the sun showed them the full extent of the catastrophe. Scores of
  weary miles lay between them and the village of Turnbull. And they certainly
  could not carry with them a tithe of the equipment. It was agreed that Mary
  Anne, since Gloria resolutely refused to ride while the rest of the party
  walked, should be packed with enough provisions to last them for a quick,
  two-day march. Then the party should strike off, leaving one man behind to
  guard the saddles, the ammunition, and all the rest of the stores. But first
  he must be moved to water. They spent the day until noon sweating under heavy
  loads and carting their equipment five mites away to a small spring. There
  they left Dick Walker, who volunteered for the duty, and then started back
  for Turnbull village.</p>

  <p>But there was one face in the party from which the eyes of Gloria never
  turned so long as she could watch him covertly, and that was big Red Norton.
  All the left side of his face was purple and swollen. Had he been struck with
  a club, or had that blow been delivered with the fist by a man of incredible
  strength? Surely, strength so great could scarcely be coupled with -</p>

  <p>She tried to combine the picture which was raised in her mind with the
  picture of the flowers which had been scattered around her two nights before.
  But here her imagination failed Gloria for the first time in her
life.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

  <p class="first">Bad news has wings. But never did bad news travel more
swiftly than on
  this occasion. Halfway to Turnbull, Themis and his following were met by a
  mounted party of a score of eager horsemen headed by the sheriff. And from
  them they learned that the entire herd of their horses had been found, in the
  evening of the day before, driven from the hills into the canyon near Hank
  Jeffries' house. At once there had sprung into the minds of the good men of
  Turnbull a picture of the entire Themis party murdered by the Indian, and
  they had struck swiftly into the mountains to bring vengeance, or to rescue
  if there were any survivors.</p>

  <p>And on the way back to Turnbull they heard the strange story of the
  pursuit of the man of mystery, and its conclusion. But should Dick Walker be
  permitted to stay alone in the hills, guarding what supplies remained, in the
  face of so terrible an enemy? The sheriff was assured that Dick Walker had
  made only one request - that he be permitted to stay where he was, alone. All
  that he wanted was an opportunity to meet the Indian face to face!</p>

  <p>So they went on. If it had been another party, there would have been gibes
  in plenty and choruses of laughter at the expense of Themis and his men. But
  the stem faces of the six silenced all mirth.</p>

  <p>Into Turnbull they descended, and there scattered, for they dreaded worse
  than death encountering the children of the village. What men dared not put a
  tongue to, children can turn into fluid laughter.</p>

  <p>In fact, what they had dared not say in the presence of the Themis party,
  was freely talked of by the entire valley the next day. Six famous men had
  started out mounted on fine horses and equipped to the teeth to catch a
  single man, and that single man had sent the six back on foot! It was a story
  with a Homeric ring. And the Turnbull valley sent up a thunderous peal of
  laughter.</p>

  <p>There was only one calm man in the valley, perhaps, and that was John
  Hampton Themis. He could have pointed into his past to describe two months
  which had been entirely devoted to the trail of a man-killing lion in South
  Africa. He finally got that lion, and he would finally get the Indian. Of
  that he was quietly certain. In the meantime, he could do with less talk and
  more action.</p>

  <p>First of all, he took Si Bartlett and Red Norton with saddle horses and
  several pack mules. They headed through the mountains to locate Dick Walker
  and their cache of equipment and provisions which must be brought back to
  Turnbull. Heading in a straight line, with no trail problems to untangle,
  they made the journey in less than two days, and by the bank of the runlet
  they found Dick Walker lying on his back with his arms thrown out crosswise,
  smiling up to the heavens with placid, open eyes, and with a purple hole in
  the center of his forehead. A revolver lay where it had fallen as he had
  released it, only a few inches from his fingertips.</p>

  <p>But the pile of equipment was intact, and beyond it they found the tracks
  of the Indian's bear - the unmistakable, huge tracks which not another
  creature in the mountains could have made. With the most casual scouting,
  they saw where the trail of Peter, the stallion and Jerry, the bear, had
  approached the camp, apparently heading straight up to it, without an effort
  to conceal their coming. But perhaps they had come by night. Perhaps the
  fight had been by night. Perhaps it was the light of his own camp fire which
  exposed poor Dick Walker to the fatal bullet.</p>

  <p>They dug his grave deep and buried him with his eyes still open. Over the
  grave they rolled big boulders to make sure that the body could not be dug by
  wild beasts. Themis had a hammer and chisel. He carved into the face of the
  largest of the stones:</p>

  <p>Here lies Richard Walker, murdered on this spot by treachery.</p>

  <p>When he had reached that point in his inscription, he turned to Si
  Bartlett and Red Norton.</p>

  <p>"Boys," he said, "I think I ought to find some kind thing to say about
  Dick and put on this stone. Something that's true about him and fine about
  him."</p>

  <p>The two were silent.</p>

  <p>"Something like generosity would do," said Themis. "Was Dick generous? He
  gave the appearance of a liberal, free-swinging youngster."</p>

  <p>Si Bartlett smiled.</p>

  <p>"Speaking of generosity," he said, "Dick was wasted up here in the
  mountains. He ought to have been down in some city. If one of the boys got
  broke, Dick would lend 'em money and charge half what he loaned as interest
  at the end of a month. He always had coin, but that was the way he handed it
  around. No, I wouldn't say that Dick was generous."</p>

  <p>"He was faithful to his friends, though?" queried Themis.</p>

  <p>"Hal Suffolk," said Red Norton, "got interested in Dick when Dick was
  being tried for killing old Petersby. Hal sent out and brought in a fine
  lawyer and somehow got Dick loose from hanging - nobody ever knew just how.
  Then him and Dick went out on a prospecting trip. They got into some sort of
  an argument, and Dick shot him dead."</p>

  <p>Themis rubbed his forehead thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Miserly, ungrateful, vicious," he said. "It seems there isn't very much
  that's good that we can say about him. But was he brave?"</p>

  <p>"Brave? He didn't know what fear was," said Norton.</p>

  <p>So it came about that the last of the inscription which Themis chiseled
  into the stone read:</p>

  <p>He never turned his back on his enemy and died as he lived, facing
  danger.</p>

  <p>So they left Dick Walker, packed the mules with the goods, and started
  back toward the town of Turnbull. One thing remained self-evident. The Indian
  must die. His daring thefts, his cunning depredations, might be forgiven in a
  court of law because he had always attempted to make restitution of property,
  as in the case of the horses of the Themis party, or else he more than paid
  with furs for the articles he took. But how could he pay the price of a human
  life?</p>

  <p>But they reached Turnbull, to find that the news they brought of the
  killing of Dick Walker was quite eclipsed by a recent happening in that
  village. Into the town, swarming as it was with armed men all keen to
  apprehend him, the Indian had come the night before, entered the house of
  Themis, found the room of the girl, and left upon her bed two priceless
  treasures - two perfect pelts of black foxes! An old trapper in a lifetime of
  work, if he is lucky, catches one such fox. But here were two beautiful skins
  whose value was simply what the fancy of a rich man chose to pay for them.
  They could not be represented by a market price. Furthermore, there was no
  doubt that the Indian had brought them. The prints of his moccasins were
  trailed back to a place in the hills where he had left Peter and the grizzly
  to come to the town. Then a serious effort had been made to trail him again
  on the return journey out of the town and into the hills. But here they had
  no luck. With consummate skill the wild man had made his return trail vanish
  into thin air, it seemed. They could not find a trace of him leaving the
  town.</p>

  <p>But Turnbull, in the meantime, boiled with rage and excitement. There was
  not a youth old enough to bear arms who did not feel that his honor had been
  outraged because this daring fellow had ventured into the town to pay court
  to beautiful Gloria Themis. Again posses were organized, but this time there
  was no sudden pursuit and scouring through the hills, for they had learned
  the lesson, and they knew that a haphazard rush through the hills brought no
  result. The expedition of Themis might have failed, but at least all men
  admitted that his method of patience had been the only possible one.</p>

  <p>Not a man would ride out to find the trail until the next day, and, in the
  meantime, to prevent a second visit of the Indian, a cordon was thrown around
  Turnbull. Literally scores of men and armed youths encircled the town. There
  was a perfect circle of camp fires, so that the light of one stretched across
  and mingled with the light of another. And the men sat in watches, relieving
  one another during the night and straining their eyes into the darkness.
  There was to be no hesitation, since the murder of Dick Walker was known. The
  instant they laid eyes upon a long-haired man, they were to challenge him,
  and if he did not stop they were to pour in their fire.</p>

  <p>And so all of Turnbull remained wakeful. But, to show the gambling spirit
  of the townsmen and their faith in the power of the Indian to make himself
  invisible, odds were freely offered and found many takers at one to three
  that the wild man would walk through the line of fires safely and reach the
  home of his lady love before the morning.</p>

  <p>In fact, there was an inner cordon, as it might be called, stretched
  around the house of Themis itself. The place which he had rented to serve as
  headquarters was guarded by a dozen trusted men organized by Dude Wesson and
  Si Bartlett themselves.</p>

  <p>And in the house, like a small kernel inside so much guarding shell, sat
  Gloria, striving to read, but feeling a mist of excitement rising before her
  eyes again and again. In her lap lay one of those precious fox skins. It was
  like a mass of silk. It was dark as night. She could not help thinking of her
  face and white throat framed in the fur. But as she stroked it she said to
  her father, who sat in the room with her for the sake of giving her more
  assurance: "Of course, if he's taken alive, I'll sell the skins for the best
  price I can get. In fact, I'll buy them myself at double the market value,
  and with that money he can retain the best lawyer in the country."</p>

  <p>"H'm," said her father. "I never before knew that you had such uneasy
  nerves, Glory. You've not turned a page for half an hour."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dad," murmured Gloria, throwing the book aside, "I can't help pitying
  him. I can't help remembering the flowers he put around me. Wasn't that a
  beautiful thing to do?"</p>

  <p>"H'm," grunted Themis again, "there is a poetic strain in many savages.
  They sacrifice to the Almighty one moment and eat the burnt flesh of the
  sacrifice the next. Don't think that this wild Indian is particularly
  remarkable in that respect. He shows his best talents on a trail."</p>

  <p>"Dad," she cried with a show of anger, "when you've committed yourself to
  a theory, you're blind to everything else!"</p>

  <p>"I simply keep my mind open to the facts," he said coldly, yet eying his
  daughter with a sharp anxiety. "This fellow doubtless has a fat squaw in the
  mountains -"</p>

  <p>"Brr!" shivered Gloria.</p>

  <p>"Gloria," said her father, "tomorrow you start for New York, and from
  there you go on to Paris. The Swains are there now. They'll take care of
  you."</p>

  <p>"I don't give a rap about Paris," said Gloria.</p>

  <p>"Gloria!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I don't care if I never see it," she insisted. "I'm going to stay here
  until I've seen the - Indian - face to face."</p>

  <p>He bit his lip.</p>

  <p>"I'm going out to talk to Bartlett about something that's just occurred to
  me," he said. "I'll be back in a moment or two and look in to see if you're
  quieter. I really am afraid that you're growing hysterical, my dear. Good-bye
  for a moment. And, of course, remember that there's no danger. No matter what
  these credulous townsmen may think, it's impossible for a man to transform
  himself into thin air and blow across the line of fires they've built."</p>

  <p>He went out, and she heard his footsteps go down the hall. Then Gloria
  picked up the book again, settled herself firmly beside a light, and made her
  eyes follow the print. In a moment she was thoroughly into the story, and
  when the door clicked behind her she said quietly: "Is everything all right,
  Dad?"</p>

  <p>And then she jerked up her head and stared at the window, not daring to
  look behind her, for whoever had entered the room had come with a footfall as
  silent as the passage of the wind. There had been merely the stirring of a
  draft through her hair and the light click of the turning lock. Someone had
  entered and locked the door behind him. She was alone with the
man.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch25"
     name="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

  <p class="first">In that moment of horror, she looked to the revolver which
lay beside her
  on the table. No, if she reached for that, the Indian - if it were indeed he
  - would bound upon her from behind. But it could not be he. It must be John
  Themis who had returned so quickly.</p>

  <p>And she forced herself to speak: "Dad!"</p>

  <p>But the voice was a harsh, low whisper. Suddenly, hysteria poured through
  her and supplied the place of strength. She leaped to her feet, scooped the
  gun from the table, whirled, and presented it at a tall man who stood just
  inside the door, a huge man, with sun-faded, brown hair which swept in a mass
  down to the nape of his neck, where it had been sawed off carelessly with a
  knife, a man whose skin was brown as an Indian's, indeed, but whose eyes were
  a bright and unmistakable blue. He was dressed in a loose, buckskin shirt;
  rather, it was a buckskin sack with a hole through which his head was passed,
  and other holes where the sun-blackened, sinewy arms went through and were
  exposed to the shoulder. His trousers were of the same home-made pattern.
  They fitted close about the ankles. And on the man's feet were soft
  moccasins.</p>

  <p>That was what she saw in the first wild glance. Then weakness swept
  through all her body. She slumped back into the chair. The gun slipped from
  her hand to the floor unheeded. It was a man of her own blood, a white man!
  No Indian looked out upon the world through such clear, blue eyes. But, as
  one terror left her, another took its place. Why had he come, and what would
  he do?</p>

  <p>She scanned his face with a feverish interest, as one sweeps through the
  denouement of a strange story. And she saw nobly molded features, a great,
  spacious forehead, an aquiline nose, a square, broad chin. Between his eyes
  there was incised a single deep wrinkle which seemed to say that this man had
  known pain and sorrow. As for his age, she guessed him at first to be thirty.
  But at a second glance something told her he was younger, much younger. Yet
  how could he be, if for six years he had defied all the manhunters of the
  Turnbull valley?</p>

  <p>He had not stirred, meanwhile. He had not spoken. But he stood there with
  fire in his eyes staring into her face. Then his glance lowered. He blushed
  through all the deep coats of tan, and raised his hand.</p>

  <p>She saw for the first time that it was filled with moss, and on top of the
  moss was a cluster of pale blue flowers such as she had never seen
  before.</p>

  <p>"I knew that there were no flowers in this place," he said, "so I brought
  these, but it was a long way, and they died. Perhaps they need the snow."</p>

  <p>Fear had been like a cold mantle on Gloria, but when she heard his voice,
  when she saw the flowers in those strong hands, the chill left her. Instead,
  she was poured full of excitement like a brimmed cup.</p>

  <p>He crossed the room. Even in that moment she noted that his step made no
  sound on the floor, no creaking of the boards. He dropped to a knee before
  her as she shrank away, and offered the withering blossoms.</p>

  <p>"You are afraid," he said sadly. "But I tell you truly that they can do
  you no harm. I found them by a stream of snow water. There was a thick
  cluster of them. They were like water themselves reflecting the sky. You see
  what a pale blue?"</p>

  <p>"I am not afraid - of them," murmured Gloria. "May I take them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," he said eagerly. "And if you close your eyes and look into the
  darkness hard you will see the mountain where they grew. It is just below
  timber line. The snow is still beneath the trees. The air is sweet with the
  pines. And the bead of the mountain goes up above into the sky. At night, it
  touches the stars."</p>

  <p>She took the moss into her lap. The flowers were faded indeed, but all
  that she could see of them was a mist of blue, a pale blue like when the sun
  is in the middle of heaven.</p>

  <p>He knelt still with his hand outstretched. His glance went up from the
  blossoms to her eyes. And the shock of those meeting glances sent a tingle
  through her.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? What are you?" said Gloria.</p>

  <p>"I am Tom Parks," he answered.</p>

  <p>It was like giving the free wind a name. She could not hold back a faint,
  excited smile.</p>

  <p>"I have heard them speak your name near the camp fire," he said. "You are
  Gloria."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is a good name to say over and over," he said gravely. "I have said it
  in the middle of the night, aloud. It brings up your face."</p>

  <p>A tide of deep crimson swept over the face of Gloria. She set her teeth,
  but still her heart fluttered.</p>

  <p>"Has that angered you?" he asked, and all the time his glance was prying
  anxiously at her face.</p>

  <p>She shook her head, for at that moment she could not have spoken.</p>

  <p>"You see," he went on in that same musical, deep voice, "I cannot tell
  what words will do. For ten years I have not spoken to a man or a woman or
  even a child, so I cannot tell what words will do. I cannot tell what words
  should be used to make people happy. But if I knew - ah, if I knew, Gloria -
  I should take a thousand and a thousand words. I should make them into songs.
  I should sing them for you until you smiled and smiled and smiled!"</p>

  <p>He had thrown back his head, and the great, strong throat trembled with
  his emotion. And Gloria looked on him with a sort of frightened wonder and
  scared delight. Outside the houses were the voices of men who were hunting
  him. They would snuff out his life like a candle. And here he was making love
  to her a dozen feet from them, and speaking as she had never before heard men
  speak. At eighteen Gloria had seen wise men grow silly. A pretty face
  performs strange feats of alchemy.</p>

  <p>"But, since I cannot talk," said the wild man, "I have brought something
  you may understand better than my words. It has made me happy. Perhaps it
  will make you happy, too."</p>

  <p>Then he took from a leather pouch at his side a little, long-tailed tree
  squirrel. The instant it was liberated, the tiny creature ran from his hand
  up his arms, climbed the ends of his hair, and sat on his head, looking at
  her out of twinkling eyes. Gloria caught her breath.</p>

  <p>"He has a small head, but he is very wise," said Tom Parks. "He brings me
  a present every day out of the trees. He is never quiet. He is always doing
  something. But, when you whistle like this, he will always stop and come to
  you."</p>

  <p>He whistled softly, a low, faint note and the squirrel whirled, climbed to
  his shoulder, darted down onto his hand, and stood up looking into his face.
  Gloria clasped her hands with delight. Girls at eighteen may be very wise,
  but, after all, they are only girls of eighteen.</p>

  <p>"Call him," said Tom, entranced with happiness as he saw her pleasure.</p>

  <p>She tried the whistle. And she learned the note almost at once. The tree
  squirrel twisted about, eyed her with an anxious interest, and then ran down
  the leg of Tom Parks and climbed up her dress to her lap. There he sat up and
  regarded her with deep interest. Tom Parks gave her a pine nut. She offered
  it to the little fellow between the tips of her fingers, and he took it in
  his paws like a child and sat up peeling the brittle shell away and then
  nibbling the kernel. The tip of his tail was curled up over his head.</p>

  <p>"When winter comes," said Tom Parks, "and you are alone in the evenings;
  when the wind is shouting through the mountains and the cave is cold in spite
  of the fire, you will be glad to have him. He will make you smile."</p>

  <p>"But how can I take him?" said Gloria. "You will be lonely and unhappy
  without him."</p>

  <p>"No, no," he protested. "You must see that if I know he is with you I
  shall be ten times happier, for when you see him, you will think of me. Is
  that true?"</p>

  <p>"I could not help it," said Gloria.</p>

  <p>He laughed silently in his happiness.</p>

  <p>"I knew that! I knew that!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>A door closed in the distance. Instantly, he was on his feet, and his
  bigness, his alertness, alarmed her.</p>

  <p>"I must go now," said he. "Your father will be coming back. No, that is
  not he!"</p>

  <p>He had listened intently while he spoke, and, though she heard nothing at
  first, she presently made out a footfall going through the house. Gloria
  slipped between Tom and the door.</p>

  <p>"You must not go!" she exclaimed. "Don't you see that the house is
  surrounded by men? And beyond them there is another circle around the town!
  How you came through them tonight, I can't imagine!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't come into town tonight," he replied quietly. "I have been in
  this house since yesterday."</p>

  <p>Gloria gasped.</p>

  <p>"In this house!"</p>

  <p>"I was afraid to wait and see you yesterday," said Tom Parks, "so I've
  been lying in a room upstairs where no one comes. There were no trails in the
  dust on the floor when I went in. I guessed that no one would come while I
  was there. And I have lain there trying to make myself brave to come and see
  you."</p>

  <p>"You were afraid - of me?" said Gloria.</p>

  <p>"I should have known," said he humbly, "that because you are so beautiful
  you are kind, also. But I have seen men do strange things. How could I be
  sure that a woman is different? You will not believe what I have seen men
  do!"</p>

  <p>"Tell me," said Gloria.</p>

  <p>With all her heart she wanted to bid him begone, or else find some way of
  sheltering him there and warning him of his danger. But to part with him was
  like, parting with a rare treasure which may be held for a moment but not
  kept. The time of their meeting was like bubbles of foam, melting away every
  instant, never to be repeated.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you everything," he said, "but once I saw a man tie a horse
  to a tree because the horse was tired and could not pull the wagon up the
  hill. He beat that horse with a whip. He beat that horse until the blood came
  - and the horse was helpless!"</p>

  <p>"Oh," cried Gloria, "how terrible! And what did you do?"</p>

  <p>He stiffened and knotted his hands, and in that gesture there was a
  connotation of Herculean power.</p>

  <p>"I climbed into the tree," he said. "Then I dropped out of the branches. I
  tied him, and I beat him with his own whip!"</p>

  <p>She had heard that story with many strange embroiderings.</p>

  <p>"Once," he went on, "I saw a hunter come to a mountain sheep that had
  broken its leg in a fall. He stabbed it in the throat and watched it bleed to
  death, slowly, slowly!"</p>

  <p>"Ah," murmured Gloria in horror, "what did you do then?"</p>

  <p>"I turned and ran away," said he, his face dark with rage and disgust. "I
  did not dare to stay near, because I wanted to take him in my hands and kill
  him. I wanted to kill him little by little, as he was killing the sheep! But
  there are other things I have seen men do. I have a horse who comes to me
  when I speak to him. He follows me when I walk. He is sad when I leave him,
  and when I come again he sees me at a great distance and comes to me with
  much neighing and calling. He dances around me. And then he hunts in my pouch
  for something I have brought. He will run with me until his heart breaks and
  still keep his ears pricking to show that his love for me is greater than his
  weariness!" He paused. Tears were in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"But that horse," he said savagely, "a man had tied to a post and was
  about to shoot. That very horse - Peter! Can you believe that?"</p>

  <p>She could not answer. His wild anger, his profound pity, and his
  overwhelming love, were like unknown countries to her. She was amazed.</p>

  <p>"But, when I had seen men do such things," he said, "how could I tell what
  even you would do - Gloria?" He made a little pause before her name and after
  it, and he spoke the name itself with an intonation that made it music. She
  was looking into a mirror and seeing herself transformed, glorified.</p>

  <p>"I lay by the fire," he said, "and listened to your voice. It was to me -
  to me - like the falling of fragrant flowers. And again, it was like a look
  up, through the trees, into the sky, into the stars. And still I was afraid
  that when I met you I would find you like those men. But the moment I came
  inside this room and into your presence I knew the truth. I knew that you
  were as good as you are beautiful."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" said Gloria and raised her hand.</p>

  <p>She saw him wince. Then he stood statue-still.</p>

  <p>"I knew it," he murmured at last. "Words cannot say what I wish them to
  say. They are made out of breath. I speak and speak and speak, but I take
  nothing from what is within me. There is still more than ever within me -
  like all that lies between two great mountains and all that lies beyond
  them!"</p>

  <p>"I cannot listen to you!" said Gloria, faintly.</p>

  <p>"I have made you unhappy?"</p>

  <p>"Not - not unhappy, but too happy, too sadly happy. Do you see?"</p>

  <p>"I shall not try to understand," he said humbly.</p>

  <p>She passed a hand across her forehead to wipe the spell away, but, when
  she looked at him again, it was unchanged. He still seemed like a young god
  out of another world, a world lost to all except himself, into which she
  could not follow him.</p>

  <p>"I have found the thing at last!" she said suddenly. "I shall keep you
  here in this room - yes, in this very room - until morning. Then, when they
  have left the fires, you will have a better chance to get away."</p>

  <p>He looked at her in amazement.</p>

  <p>"You don't know them, then," he said. "You don't know these men. They hate
  me. But how have I harmed them? Still, they hate me. If they knew you helped
  me, they would kill you, Gloria, even you!"</p>

  <p>"They would never touch a woman, not the worst of them," said Gloria.</p>

  <p>But he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I have seen them torture dumb animals," he said, "and a woman can speak.
  Men who kill sheep would kill women. I know! And so I leave you, Gloria,
  before they come. But I shall come again!"</p>

  <p>"You must not. They watch me in order to catch you. And since Dick Walker
  was killed - oh, I know that you killed him because he deserved death, but
  the others cannot understand."</p>

  <p>"I did not kill that man," he said calmly.</p>

  <p>She stared at him. But could any man lie with such a steady face?</p>

  <p>"They found him dead," she said slowly. "And they found the trail of a
  horse and a bear near him."</p>

  <p>"I came to that place and saw him on his back with a hole in his
  forehead," said Tom with a shudder. "I went away quickly. It is a terrible
  thing to see a dead man. I have seen two!"</p>

  <p>"Ah," murmured Gloria, "it is true, then! He was killed by some other
  man."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then," she cried in excitement, "don't you see what you must do? You must
  go back to that place. You must find the murderer. You must bring him to
  Turnbull. That is the only serious crime they can charge against you. Money
  can settle all the rest, and I have money."</p>

  <p>He was bewildered, fumbling for her meaning.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean," he said at last, "that if I find him and bring him here,
  they will no longer hunt me?"</p>

  <p>"I mean that!" said Gloria. "And if -"</p>

  <p>She stopped, for a familiar step came hastily down the hall, stopped at
  her door. The knob was turned under his hand.</p>

  <p>"What the deuce, Gloria!" cried the father. "Have you locked yourself
  in?"</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch26"
     name="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

  <p class="first">And Gloria was rooted to the floor with horror. She should
not have
  allowed him to stay until the trap had closed. Before she could rally her
  wits, Tom Parks turned to her with a smile and a gesture which, if it meant
  anything, declared that there was no serious danger immediately ahead. She
  saw him turn the key in the lock. The door opened. Then, suddenly, fear for
  her father leaped into her brain. There was a shrill, involuntary cry of
  warning, but what happened came before Themis could understand and defend
  himself.</p>

  <p>As he stepped into the room, he was seized from the side, pitched headlong
  to the floor on his face with as much ease as though he had been a child, and
  Tom Parks, leaping into the hall, paused to turn the lock from the outside.
  She heard it click. Then John Hampton Themis sprang to his feet with his
  revolver in his hand, bewildered and furious. He cast at his daughter one
  baffled glance. Then he leaped for the door.</p>

  <p>When he found it locked, his shout of warning rang through the house.
  Next, a bullet from his revolver shattered the lock, and he burst into the
  hall.</p>

  <p>As for Tom Parks, he had not fled headlong down the hall. He turned into
  the door of the room next to that of Gloria. He found a window open and stood
  beside it, waiting. Beyond the window he could see armed men standing
  regarding the house with a sober interest, for they had half heard the cry of
  Gloria. But, when the revolver shot of Themis was heard, then the crash of
  the door as it was flung open, and last his shout of rage and alarm in the
  hall, they waited no longer outside the house but rushed pell-mell around the
  corner to enter it and get at the root of the trouble.</p>

  <p>That was the movement for which Tom had waited. Instantly, he was out the
  window and had dropped with the lightness of a cat to the ground. There, in
  the deep shadow of the house, he waited an instant. He was unarmed, and his
  hands ached for a gun. But, when he came near the haunts of men, the great
  enemy, he purposely left weapons behind him, because he never knew when the
  temptation would become stronger than his ability to resist.</p>

  <p>That second of thoughtfulness gave him a course, however. In another
  moment the lines of watchers around the town would know that he was inside
  its limits, and, by simply turning around and facing the village instead of
  the outer night from which they had expected him to come, they would have him
  sealed in a trap.</p>

  <p>He raced to the rear of the next house on the street. In the corral beside
  the barn there were horses, but none for his purpose. He could tell that even
  by their outlines in the darkness. He went on like a flash to the next corral
  and scanned a huddle of horses standing in a corner. He looked for a head,
  not for a body, and finally he saw what he wanted, a small, compact, bony
  head, with short, sharp ears. That was his horse!</p>

  <p>He sprang to the barn, wrenched the door open, and on a row of pegs inside
  he found bridles, saddles, and blankets. But he took only a bridle. Even for
  that there was barely time. Voices were beginning to shout here and there in
  the outer night. Perhaps the whole circle of the camp fires had been alarmed
  by this time.</p>

  <p>He came out again. The horses in the corner of the corral split apart and
  scattered, snorting.</p>

  <p>"Halloo!" shouted the voice of a man from the house in front of the bam.
  "Hello, out there? What's up?"</p>

  <p>Tom made no answer. He had just succeeded in cornering the horse with the
  finely made head. It was a disappointingly small animal - not comparable with
  Peter, of course. But he stayed with his choice.</p>

  <p>"Look here!" roared the man of the house, now excited. "What's up out
  there? Bill, come along and let's take a look."</p>

  <p>Tom heard the voice of "Bill" answer. But now he was working at the head
  of the horse. The stubborn little brute kept its jaws locked and refused to
  admit the bit. He put two fingers into the side of the beast's mouth and dug
  them down into the gums. That forced the mouth open, and instantly the bridle
  was on and slipped over the ears of the mustang.</p>

  <p>After that, he did not wait to secure the throat latch. He sprang to the
  back of his horse - and instantly found that his hands were filled with an
  argument of another nature, for the bronco tipped into the air and came down
  crooked. For thirty seconds it bucked with a wild enthusiasm and a cunning
  intelligence which proved it to be an old hand. But there was no unseating
  Tom Parks. He had learned to ride Peter in the mountains without a saddle.
  And he had a grip with his knees almost sufficient to break the ribs of his
  mount, so he clung in back.</p>

  <p>"By heaven!" roared one of the men who were running toward the corral.
  "It's somebody on Sideways!"</p>

  <p>Sideways was demonstrating the aptness of that name by a series of bucks
  from side to side delivered with the violence of a snapping whip and the
  speed of striking fists.</p>

  <p>"Shoot for him. Try for his head!" cried one of the men.</p>

  <p>Tom gritted his teeth. It is impossible to sit a bucking horse without
  carrying one's head high. He could not duck and flatten himself along the
  back of the mustang. A gun clanged, and a bullet sang wickedly and close to
  his ear.</p>

  <p>"Look out for Sideways, though!" cautioned the other. "I'll watch the
  gate. We'll get him!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Sideways came out of his bucking humor and decided to try
  running, as horses will do, apparently thinking that they can run out from
  under the burden on their backs. So Sideways bolted and made, naturally
  enough, straight for the corral gate. A frightened yell went up from the man
  who had posted himself there. Two guns banged in close succession, but the
  shots flew idly overhead, for the instant the mustang stopped bucking and
  began to run, Tom had flattened himself along its neck.</p>

  <p>They reached the gate. He twitched Sideways to one side and aimed him at
  the fence. Did the little brute know how to jump, and could he manage it with
  such a weight on his back? The question was quickly answered. Sideways went
  for the fence with a grunt of anger, reared, and skimmed it like a bird!
  Yells of astonishment greeted the feat.</p>

  <p>He landed in his stride and was off racing. Tom let him get past two
  barns. Then he twitched him to the side and hurried him across the village,
  leaving behind him the line of camp fires with the excited men milling around
  them, black, misshapen silhouettes.</p>

  <p>The village of Turnbull was long and narrow, like most Western towns. In
  an instant he was across the main street, had plunged Sideways down an alley,
  and came in view of the opposite camp fires. Everywhere was shouting and
  confusion and the gleam of the fires upon guns.</p>

  <p>Coming out of the black night he was dazzled by that glare of many lights.
  He could not choose or pick. He simply made for the first gap between the
  fires while a wild yell of excitement and fear went tingling up to greet him.
  And then the air was filled with the din of guns.</p>

  <p>"We were onto fifty yards away," goes the old hunting story. "Every one of
  us was a good shot. At that range, who could miss? We put forty bullets into
  that grizzly before he hit the brush, and we lost him. Yes, sir, he was a
  walking lead mine before he disappeared." Yet, when the bear was found dead
  the next day, there was a solitary slug in him, and he had died from the
  effects of that one. What had made fifty bullets or more fly astray? Simply
  that fever of nervousness which makes the hand, so steady in firing at a
  target, quiver just a little in firing at a living thing.</p>

  <p>And hands which shook when they fired at a bear would certainly be
  tremorous when they attempted to kill this terrible wild man who came upon
  them by surprise from an unexpected direction. Just an instant, and the
  flying horse had carried him - long, bare arms and long, flying hair and all
  - out of the darkness of the houses and into the midst of the guards.</p>

  <p>And of a hundred shots, not one struck home or even grazed the target.
  There was one flurry of wild shooting, and then Sideways, running with wild
  speed in his terror, dipped into a swale in a hollow and was lost to view.
  The others rushed to the edge of the swale to get in another volley, but by
  that time Sideways had put a precious hundred yards between him and the
  foremost of the sentinels.</p>

  <p>The last volley flew wildly astray, and then the blanketing night closed
  on them, and Tom headed for the hills.</p>

  <p>What a blessing it was that the noise fell away behind him, every stride
  of the good little horse making it dimmer! He had no occasion to regret the
  selection of Sideways, bucking and all, for every inch of his scant fifteen
  hands was all horse. He was a bundle of strength and nervous energy, and it
  was all loosed in that wild burst to get away from the town.</p>

  <p>But now Tom Parks drew the mustang back to a more moderate gait. A furlong
  of sprinting exhausts a man as much as a mile of running. And Sideways had
  been taxed by fear and anger and a racing gait all at once. It was no wonder
  that his sides were heaving as Tom brought him down to a canter. And he began
  to talk as he alone knew how to talk to a dumb beast. What wonder that he
  could, when only dumb beasts had been near to listen for years? And in a
  moment the tremor had left the body of Sideways, and under the persuasion of
  that gentle voice and the hand which stroked his sleek, strong neck, he began
  to raise his head, and one ear pricked forward. It warmed the heart of Tom to
  see!</p>

  <p>In the meantime, all was not well. There had been a pale semicircle of
  light over the eastern hills. Now from that glow was born a great, full moon
  which filled the valley with swarthy shadows. It was not so bad as the
  all-revealing sun, but it was bad enough. For one thing, he had come out from
  Turnbull on the side farthest from the direction which led toward Peter and
  safety. For another thing, there was a dull and increasing roar of hoofs in
  his rear. And Tom knew that the battle of the night was by no means
  ended.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch27"
     name="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

  <p class="first">They were coming fast and hard on his heels. Every man in
the village who
  had a horse had flung himself into the saddle. But most had fallen to the
  rear. There remained a round dozen of well-mounted men who had pushed on. To
  be sure, their horses had the burden of saddles to carry, a thing from which
  Sideways was freed; but the little mustang had in Tom a greater weight than
  an average rider and saddle combined. Moreover, he had used up the blossom of
  his strength in that first wild burst of running and bucking. And Tom
  shrewdly suspected that Sideways, with his short legs and his sturdy frame,
  would be better fitted for a long and steady run than for the arduous labors
  of a swift chase.</p>

  <p>The thing to do was to get to Peter. Five minutes of that matchless speed
  would leave the posse staggering and floundering behind him in the night. But
  how to reach Peter was the problem.</p>

  <p>He decided, first of all, to keep straight on until the hills were a
  screen behind him. Then he would angle to the right and speed around until he
  could break across toward the opposite side of the valley where Peter had
  been left. What he needed now was a burst of speed to carry him into those
  hills as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Tom called to Sideways, and the good little horse lowered his nose,
  stretched out his neck, and raced like a champion until the steep
  hill-shadows pushed past him and he was shut from the view of the
  pursuers.</p>

  <p>Chance came to the help of Tom then. He saw before him half a dozen little
  ravines opening like so many funnels into the heart of the hills. How could
  the pursuers pick, the right avenue for following him? He took the one which
  led most directly to the right, and, still keeping Sideways at top speed, he
  tore down it. Behind him, as the mustang raced, he heard the roar of hoofs
  and the shouting of men as they drove past the entrance to the canyon. But
  Tom did not slacken the pace, even after this assurance that the posse had
  gone wrong. What he vitally needed was a sufficiently big gap between him and
  the others so that when he chose he could angle back across the Turnbull
  valley.</p>

  <p>But he rode fast simply to make surety doubly sure, as men will do
  sometimes. It was twenty minutes before he decided that he could safely cut
  back. Then he let Sideways, now badly blown by all this sprinting, fall to a
  swaying canter which, he knew, the little horse could maintain all day. So he
  drifted back through the hills and came out on the plain once more.</p>

  <p>He scanned it eagerly right and left, but over the rolling ground, now
  white with moonshine, he saw no dark forms of hurrying horsemen. He let
  Sideways continue at the same pace. And then, from a slight elevation, he
  caught sight of the wide, bright body of the river flowing through the
  distance ahead of him. They could swim that to safety.</p>

  <p>But, as he sent Sideways ahead at a slightly freshened pace, a change of
  the wind brought an ominous sound on his ear. He swung sharply about, and he
  saw streaking across the crest of a low knoll a compact body of half a dozen
  mounted men, aimed at him at full speed.</p>

  <p>For a moment he was stunned. Then he saw the only possible explanation.
  Those who led the party which first pursued him must have guessed that his
  retreat into the hills was only a feint, for he had always made his descents
  into Turnbull Valley from the opposite side of the valley. So they had split
  their party into sections. One plunged after him into the hills, and he had
  heard them go by on a false scent. The other half roamed along the foothills
  to see if they could not find him as he doubled back. And that strategy had
  succeeded. There they were coming with their comparatively fresh horses which
  had been kept in hand all this time. And here was he with a weary mount!</p>

  <p>But there was nothing for it save to make Sideways sprint again and head
  straight on for the river. That was what he did, working himself well forward
  toward the withers of the little horse so that his weight would be a lesser
  burden at great speed. Then, with hand and voice, he shot Sideways ahead.</p>

  <p>And the brave little horse answered with all the strength in his body and,
  what was more important, with all the power of his soul. He ran till his legs
  were numb and his lungs on fire, but still those swiftly shooting shadows
  behind him gained and gained. In vain Tom tried to angle up the river for a
  more favorable crossing place. The instant he started to travel at a slant,
  the pursuit gained with appalling speed. And still, when he straightened the
  little horse full for the river, they gained again.</p>

  <p>Even if he gained the water, they could reach the bank, and; sitting
  quietly in the saddle, they could riddle him with bullets better aimed than
  the few which they now, from time to time, sent whizzing after him. But
  shooting from horseback is a fine art in itself. If he, Tom Parks, had a
  rifle with him, he would show them how it was done. If he had six shots, he
  would empty six saddles for them and hunt the rest of them back across the
  valley as fast as they had hunted him! But his hands were empty, and he could
  only groan, then throw all his anguish into the voice that called on Sideways
  for more speed.</p>

  <p>And still, somewhere in the valiant recesses, of his heart, Sideways found
  mysterious stores of energy upon which he called. Still he answered that
  voice, until he was reeling in his stride. Yet the posse closed suddenly upon
  him. Now the water flashed just before them. Headlong he drove the mustang at
  it. A cloud of silver spray was dashed up by the feet of the horse. He lunged
  in, and the water closed over them.</p>

  <p>That instant Tom thrust himself from the mustang and kicked off
  underwater, swimming below the surface and with all his might. He swam until
  his lungs threatened to burst. Then his hands touched bottom. He drew himself
  to the edge of the river. In a tangle of weeds he thrust his nose and eyes
  above the surface and saw the drama that followed.</p>

  <p>The horsemen of the posse, as he had expected, had halted on the bank.
  Their rifle butts pitched into the hollow of their shoulders. For an instant
  they scanned the silver surface of the Turnbull for sight of the man they
  wanted. But, imagining that the mustang in some way concealed the master,
  they poured a volley at that gallant head, where Sideways was struggling on
  across the current.</p>

  <p>And Tom, with an aching heart, saw poor Sideways sink beneath the surface.
  Then, to his soul of souls, he made a vow that for the sake of Sideways he
  would be kinder to all horses - to all dumb creatures - if his own life were
  spared from this crisis.</p>

  <p>But there was now a shout of wonder from the posse as they saw the head of
  the horse go down while still no man appeared in the water.</p>

  <p>"I guess I nailed him just as he hit the water," said one voice. "Sure
  looked to me like I landed him. Look down the stream a ways, boys. Maybe
  you'll see him floating."</p>

  <p>"If he went down, he won't be up for days," said another. "Why didn't you
  hold up and wait when you seen we had him, Bill?"</p>

  <p>"A fox like that?" said Bill. "Any way of getting him was good enough for
  me. But I'd sure like to see his face. Hunt down the stream, boys. This
  current might wash him into the shallows."</p>

  <p>They drifted down the stream a little, but Tom dared not move from his
  place. There he lay in the numbing water and heard them come back.</p>

  <p>"The thing to do," said the quiet voice of John Hampton Themis, "is for
  you fellows to go back to the town and tell what has happened. Tell 'em that
  we've run the rat into the water. I'll stay out here and watch the
  place."</p>

  <p>"D'you think that he's living and breathing down under the water, Mr.
  Themis?" asked another with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to think," answered Themis. "I only know that it will
  be a strange thing if a man such as he seems to be has been disposed of as
  easily as this. We've only accounted for one of his lives tonight!"</p>

  <p>This brought another good-natured laugh. They were in high spirits. And
  the heart of Tom raged in him as he listened to their laughter. Presently,
  however, they agreed with Themis. They bade him farewell and assured him that
  he would not have a lonely watch. Others would come out from the village in
  the night to see the place, and in the morning they would all come out and
  drag the river by sunlight.</p>

  <p>"And watch yourself, Mr. Themis," they said. "The rat might come out of
  the water and sink his teeth into you!"</p>

  <p>So, with more laughter, they rode on. The great silence of the night fell
  over the place. There was only the light whisper of the river against its
  banks.</p>

  <p>"Strange - very strange," Tom heard Themis say, speaking just above
  him.</p>

  <p>Then the noise of the horse of Themis retreated down the river a little,
  and Tom dared to raise his head above the weeds. Down the bank he saw Themis
  disappear below a knoll. Quickly, he worked himself out of the slime. On the
  grassy bank he rolled himself. He worked all his muscles convulsively two or
  three times to restore, in part, his deadened circulation and the vitality
  which the chill of the water had sapped. Then he rose to his knees.</p>

  <p>Instantly, he heard the sound of the hoofs of the horse as the solitary
  sentinel started to return. He must find shelter somewhere, and there was
  only one possibility. That was a growth of shrubs not more than a foot high,
  far too low and too thin to give him actually a shelter, but they must serve
  his purpose. He lay among them, face down, because there is nothing which,
  for some mysterious reason, so attracts the eye as the human face, even by
  night. He could only pray that his body might not be distinguishable among
  the shadows of the shrub. And, to reinforce his hope, he felt that the eye of
  the watcher would be chiefly employed on the bright surface of the river.</p>

  <p>Back came the noise of hoofs. It was aimed directly at him. So straight
  came the noise of the approach that he turned his head toward it, and it was
  as he feared! Themis was letting the horse wander on straight toward the
  patch of shrubbery. Perhaps he would let the animal walk straight through
  it!</p>

  <p>Tom gathered his legs a little under him. If it came to the worst, he must
  attack in the face of that gleaming rifle which was balanced across the
  pommel of Themis' saddle! And he waited, his teeth set, his eyes gleaming,
  his toes digging in to gain a purchase in case that leap must be made.</p>

  <p>And still the nodding head of the horse came on, while Themis sat the
  saddle looking toward the water. A yard away - suddenly the horse stopped,
  snorted, then bounded to the side while Themis, with an exclamation of
  surprise, lowered his rifle and drew heavily on the reins.</p>

  <p>There was no escape now for Tom. The horse had seen him. The man would see
  him in another instant. He came out of the shrubs with a rush. He saw the
  rifle swung up. Then he leaped for the rider and with upflung left hand
  touched the muzzle of the gun of Themis. It discharged its contents just
  beside Tom's ear. Then, his lunge carrying him on and up, one hand fell on
  the shoulder of Themis, another circled his neck.</p>

  <p>Themis was torn from the saddle and brought heavily to the earth. Half
  stunned by the fall, he allowed the rifle to be jerked from his nervous
  hands. He was forced upon his back. In a trice, hands and feet were tied.
  Then he was wrenched to a sitting posture and found himself confronting the
  muddy, dripping figure which stood there, rifle in hand.</p>

  <p>"You are still alive," said a stern voice. "You are her father, and
  therefore you are still alive. But the others, when I find them, shall die.
  They murdered the poor horse while it swam in the water. How had that horse
  harmed them? They shall die as the horse died. Tell them that when they come.
  I have let them hunt me like a dog through the mountains. When they come
  again, tell them that I shall shoot, and I never miss."</p>

  <p>He threw rifle and revolver far off into the river, while the frightened
  horse fled, neighing. Then he ran to the edge of the river and dived into
  it.</p>

  <p>Themis, looking after him, saw the water close above him with hardly a
  ripple to break the surface. He came up far toward the center of the stream,
  swimming strongly, and his face buried. He reached the farther bank. He
  climbed the shore and stood a moment, a dripping, shining figure. Then he
  struck across country with a long, free stride and was lost in the moon
  haze.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch28"
     name="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">"We start this afternoon," said John Hampton Themis with
the cheery
  finality of one who expects opposition but pretends that he does not dream of
  it. "I have completed the arrangements, my dear. New York and then a boat for
  Paris."</p>

  <p>But Gloria, for a moment, merely tapped her foot and watched him. She
  seemed to be more interested in him than in any effect this statement might
  have upon her.</p>

  <p>"You'll have a beautiful time, Dad," she said, "I wish you joy."</p>

  <p>"And you," said Themis, "will have your Paris - as much of it as you can
  stand."</p>

  <p>"Paris?" she said in mock surprise. "Paris for me? No, no, Dad. I've
  finally become convinced that you are right. I'm too young to do justice to
  Paris, or for Paris to do justice to me. I'll wait. I don't care how many
  years it is - but I'll wait for another time."</p>

  <p>Themis cleared his throat, began a sentence, and changed his mind.</p>

  <p>"Just what are your plans?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen nearly enough of Turnbull Valley," she said.</p>

  <p>She whistled softly. A tiny little form whisked across the room, ran up
  her skirt, and perched upon her knee. It was the tree squirrel. She began to
  pet it idly.</p>

  <p>"So you stay here?" asked Themis, staring fixedly at the squirrel.</p>

  <p>"Yes, thank you. I've barely become acclimated, you see. It would be a
  shame to leave now. And for my part, I don't see how you can leave, Dad."</p>

  <p>"No?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not. Every man in the valley expects you to stay here until
  you've caught the wild man - the Indian, as you call him."</p>

  <p>Themis flushed.</p>

  <p>"I freely admit," he said, "that I was in error. He's white. As for
  staying here to capture him, you've surely not forgotten what happened the
  other night?"</p>

  <p>"In what way?"</p>

  <p>"He had me helpless under his gun, and he let me live."</p>

  <p>"People may say that you're afraid to face him again."</p>

  <p>Once more Themis flushed.</p>

  <p>"I'll have to endure that," he said quietly. "My friends, I hope, will not
  believe it. And as for the others - well, no matter what they think, I can't
  stay on the trail of a man who had me at his mercy, then let me go after I
  had hunted him for his life."</p>

  <p>He sighed, and his glance probed the distance with a singular regret.</p>

  <p>"How he did it," he said, "I still can't understand. I look back at it,
  and it still doesn't seem possible that any human being could have been
  capable of such activity. It was like the rush of a tiger - like the rush of
  a tiger, on my honor!"</p>

  <p>He rose and paced the room hurriedly. His voice was low, while speaking of
  that incredible thing.</p>

  <p>"He must have been flat on the ground when the horse shied, Glory. But he
  came off from it with a bound as though he were made of rubber. And the
  second leap had him at me. I'll never forget that face. His teeth were
  glinting in the moonshine. His long hair was tangled with mud and dirt. He
  looked like a devil. All that happened before I could get in a shot!"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"When he caught my shoulders - gad, his fingers seemed iron! The flesh is
  still black and blue!"</p>

  <p>He rubbed that shoulder meditatively.</p>

  <p>"Frankly," he said, "I'm afraid of him. I'd hate like the devil to have to
  trail him. But the worst of it is that, while I might go with a gun to shoot
  him, he'd not take his chances to shoot in turn, because I'm your father. And
  that, Glory, brings me to the crux of the matter!"</p>

  <p>She nodded quietly, but she drew the tree squirrel suddenly close to
  her.</p>

  <p>"Glory," he said slowly, "you want to stay here because of that wild man.
  Tell me truly."</p>

  <p>"That's the exact truth," said Gloria. "You've seen through me, Dad."</p>

  <p>He shuddered. There was such pain in his face that she lowered her eyes,
  unable to watch him.</p>

  <p>"Gloria," he said sadly, "it's my fault, I know. It's entirely my fault.
  I've let you grow up doing as you please. I've spoiled you terribly. And now
  you'll fight for your own way. It's impossible for you to give up anything
  you want."</p>

  <p>She slipped out of the chair and went to him and took his hands.</p>

  <p>The squirrel ran up the back of the chair and perched on the top of it,
  peering at her with its bright little eyes.</p>

  <p>"Don't say that, Dad," she pleaded. "I know you've spoiled me, but there's
  hardly a thing in the world that I wouldn't do for you if you seriously asked
  me."</p>

  <p>"Except to leave the Turnbull with me now?"</p>

  <p>She bowed her head.</p>

  <p>"Glory!" he cried in agony. "Do you mean it? Even if I beg you, as I do
  now, to come with me?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dad," she answered, her eyes filling with tears, "if you only would
  ask proof of me in some other way. If I could only show you how dear you are
  to me, and what I would suffer for you! But this one thing -"</p>

  <p>He released her hands and stepped to the window, breathing deep. Then he
  forced himself to face her again. It seemed to Gloria that he had aged by ten
  years in the past day.</p>

  <p>"It means a tragedy if you stay here," he said. "My dear, we all feel that
  we know ourselves better than others can possibly know us. But don't you
  think we may sometimes be wrong? I think I understand you, Glory, simply
  because I love you so much. And I tell you that if you see this wild man
  again while your brain is still in a riot from that first meeting, you'll
  lose control of yourself. Before you know it, you'll be married, and your
  life will be ruined!"</p>

  <p>She paused to show that she was taking all his words to heart.</p>

  <p>"Will you listen to my viewpoint?" she said at last.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Themis. "I want you to talk - talk about everything. Get
  it out of your heart and into words if you can!"</p>

  <p>"Suppose you look at it in this way, then. If I never see him again, if I
  never talk with him again, the thought of him will haunt me. Dad, this room
  is filled with him. He was here five minutes, but he has left something in
  every corner of the room. The sound of his voice has never run out of my
  ears. I keep seeing his face - sometimes I've turned around short in going
  down the hall because it seemed as if he were coming behind me with that
  silent step of his! Do you understand how I feel now?"</p>

  <p>"Glory," he said, "let's take another angle. If you stay here, the man's
  devotion to you will bring him down to the town again. And when he comes
  down, he'll be caught. He escaped once, you know by how small a margin. A
  second time he can't escape. And when he's caught, he'll be hanged for
  murder. Nothing can prevent that."</p>

  <p>"It's not true!" cried Gloria. "He told me with his own voice that he did
  not kill Dick Walker!"</p>

  <p>"I believe him as thoroughly as you do," said Themis. "But that does not
  spoil the case against him. He had a motive for killing Walker. His trail was
  seen going there. What more could be needed? He'd be hanged, Gloria."</p>

  <p>"An innocent man! Oh, Dad, it's too horrible! I'll find some means of
  preventing it!"</p>

  <p>"That's a blind hope. If you really are fond of the wild man - of Tom
  Parks, as you call him - the best thing is to leave Turnbull Valley, because,
  so long as you stay here, you're the bait for a trap that may catch him."</p>

  <p>"He has gone himself to find the murderer of Walker."</p>

  <p>"But the trail has been wiped out by the rains before this. You mustn't
  console yourself with absolute impossibilities, my dear."</p>

  <p>"Oh," she cried, bewildered, "there will be some way!"</p>

  <p>Her father shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Besides," he said, "even if he dodges the law for a time, he'll
  eventually be captured."</p>

  <p>"They've failed for six years."</p>

  <p>"What's six years to the law? It will wait a lifetime. Eventually, it
  wins. It has forever. It uses a million hands. One man cannot stand against
  it, particularly since Parks has become notorious. Man hunters will come from
  all parts of the West. They'll run his trail through every month of the
  years. Finally, he'll go down. Gloria, if you were to attach yourself to him,
  you'd attach yourself to a doomed cause."</p>

  <p>He saw, by the way her head went back, that he had made a wrong step.</p>

  <p>"Dad!" she exclaimed. "Do you want me to leave the ship because the rats
  have left it? Do you want me to be a coward?"</p>

  <p>He gritted his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Think of your friends, Gloria."</p>

  <p>"He's worth all of them!"</p>

  <p>"How could he meet them?"</p>

  <p>"They would be honored by a syllable from him, or else they're not worthy
  to speak with him! But don't you see, I only want to meet him once more and
  make sure? Perhaps it will be different when I see him again. The glamour
  will be gone."</p>

  <p>He shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"Not with you, Gloria. It needs more time than you'll have between
  meetings. No man has ever meant anything to you. And now you'll cling to this
  first enthusiasm -"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he stopped talking. He went to her and took her in his arms.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said, "if I were a religious man, I should pray God to help
  us both do right in this thing."</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch29"
     name="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

  <p class="first">When Tom Parks, well before sunup, reached that cleft in
the hills where
  he would find the stallion and big Jerry, he sent a long screaming whistle
  over the trees and listened until he heard a whinny faint in the distance.
  After that, he did not wait for either the horse or the bear to come. They
  would find him and wait.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the good men of Turnbull were mustering and making ready
  for another hunt. But it would still be a short interval before sunup and
  their start, so Tom lay down in a corner behind a rock, where the wind could
  not get at him, and was instantly asleep.</p>

  <p>For two hours he lay without stirring, and when he wakened the fresh light
  of dawn filled the sky. Beside him was Peter, cropping the grass. In the near
  distance was the bulk of Jerry, paying his attention to a colony of ants. He
  had already devoured the myriads of half a dozen anthills. Now he was
  demolishing a seventh nation, but at the voice of Tom he whirled and came
  with his lumbering but swift stride across the clearing.</p>

  <p>Peter, in the meantime, began to sweep around the returned master in swift
  loops, flirting his heels into the air and shaking his head, bucking and
  gamboling more in air than on firm ground. As for Jerry, he stood upon his
  hind legs, viewed the master carefully, then went around him, sniffing the
  strange man scents which he found, and growling terribly all the while.
  Eventually, he decided that all was well and allowed his head to be rubbed
  for a moment.</p>

  <p>But there was only a moment to be spared; In ten minutes Tom had taken out
  the saddle from the place where he had cached it, and the journey of the day
  was started. And, before he had gone two miles, he looked back to a height
  and saw them coming, the stream of a score of dogs and fully as many
  riders.</p>

  <p>He climbed into the rougher country, for it was there that Jerry could
  make progress that defied the imitation of men on horseback. From another
  eminence he stared down and saw that two other packs were out, two other
  groups of hard riders were following them.</p>

  <p>These things, however, he viewed with only a dim concern. He would break
  their hearts before the day had ended. But he had more to do than simply
  avoid a few posses. Far away was the place where Dick Walker had ended his
  evil life and been buried. Thither he must go and hunt around the place for
  the trail of the murderer. If he could find that trail, if it would lead him
  to the man, if he could extract the confession from him, then he was free to
  ride down into Turnbull and meet Gloria unafraid.</p>

  <p>But how many "ifs" lay between!</p>

  <p>All that day he worked swiftly through the mountains. Among the rocks, he
  descended the steep places on foot, at a run. He climbed the difficult ridges
  seated on the back of Jerry, and he covered the open stretches on the back of
  the stallion.</p>

  <p>Here and there he stopped, in favorable places, to lay out trail problems
  which occupied him five minutes, but which would take the pursuit ten times
  that long to unravel. In the twilight he found and shot a deer, which
  provided ample for himself and Jerry. And it was still the dark before dawn
  when he started on the trail again. In the mid afternoon, he found the heap
  of rocks which marked the grave of Dick Walker.</p>

  <p>But as for the trail of the true murderer - it was like hunting for a
  needle in a haystack! In the first place, days had intervened since the
  murder, and rains had washed down the soil. In the second place, the party of
  Themis had trampled all the region around the grave.</p>

  <p>So, while Peter grazed and Jerry dug for roots, Tom cast a corkscrew trail
  around the place, cutting for signs with an eager diligence.</p>

  <p>Darkness closed on him, and still he had not succeeded. With the dawn, he
  was up again and at it, hunting feverishly now, for the posse must be close
  upon his heels. And in the midmorning he found the first thing which might be
  of assistance.</p>

  <p>It was the empty shell of a forty-five-caliber bullet, such as had been
  fired into the head of Walker. It lay a full mile from the place of the
  shooting in the direction of the eastern mountains. Of course, it might have
  been thrown there by anyone. Any member of the Themis party might have gone
  out this far and taken a shot at a rabbit and then thrown the empty shell out
  of his gun. But there was a chance in ten that it was the shell belonging to
  the slug that had killed Walker, and in that case the place where it lay
  meant something to Tom.</p>

  <p>He calculated exactly a line between that spot and the site of Walker's
  grave. If that line were projected into the mountains, it might give him the
  course which the slayer had taken. But the projection pointed straight at a
  mountainside, and certainly it was not probable that a fugitive would take
  that steep ascent instead of sticking to the canyons where he could have made
  far better time!</p>

  <p>But Tom could not stay to argue probabilities. Possibilities were all that
  he could work on. He struck ahead, aiming his course with nicety for the very
  peak of the mountain, riding in just the course that a horseman would have
  been most likely to take if he had ridden in that direction.</p>

  <p>By noon he was halfway up the side of the mountain, but there had not been
  the ghost of a sign to encourage him along the trail. Here he paused while
  Jerry busied himself with a chipmunk's burrow. After half an hour's rest he
  went on again until he reached the mountaintop early in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>There he found a small spring welling out of the ground. The sight of it
  excited Tom. He had covered since dawn a stretch of ground which would have
  made a good day's march for an ordinary horse and man. Even Peter was a
  little wearied by his efforts. And, if the murderer had indeed taken that
  trail, the sight of running water must have been too great a temptation to
  him. Here he would surely have camped, even if he did not build a fire.</p>

  <p>But there was no sign, still. From the pine saplings no tips had been cut
  to make a bed. And if deadwood had been cut, it was impossible for Tom to
  find the place. Though, for that matter, some of the little, dead shrubs
  might have been pulled up by the roots, and the rains would have washed the
  holes full of sediment. He looked uneasily at the rumble of stones around the
  spring, and his stanch heart began to fail him. To be sure, he had learned
  patience in an incomparable school, but he felt that the trail had vanished
  into thin air if, indeed, it had ever been a trail at all.</p>

  <p>Jerry came lumbering from his root digging and began to tumble the stones
  over. Under some he found grubs which were licked up by that restless, red
  tongue. Under others he found nothing. But he went on carelessly until a
  great, two-hundred-pound boulder was tugged over for the mere sake of showing
  his strength, perhaps, and he began sniffing at the dark undersurface, all
  sweating with moisture. His growl drew Tom nearer. He looked down to the
  bottom of the rock for the want of something better to do.</p>

  <p>It was very dark indeed. The moisture alone could hardly account for its
  blackness. All the rest of the boulder was a dull gray. Suddenly, he leaned
  and drew a fingertip across the surface of the stone. The tip was blackened
  by the contact, and Tom straightened with an exclamation of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>There was only one way to account for that thin layer of soot. A fire had
  been built near the stone, which had later fallen upon its face. And it must
  have been a recent camp fire which had done the work, no matter if other
  traces of the fire were lacking. The heavy winds and the rains might have
  washed all other symbols of it away. This one was enough to set the heart of
  Tom on fire with hope.</p>

  <p>He went back to the head of the mountain to reconnoiter the hollows and
  the valleys beneath, and there, to be sure, he saw them. The wind fanned his
  face gently, and it carried to him a faint echo of the clamoring dogs. There
  they streamed, small as ants in the distance; and behind them was the little
  army of the hunters. Tom frowned and shrugged his shoulders. It was not for
  fear of them, to be sure. But how could he follow and untangle the mysteries
  of this dim trail while these men followed in his trail? His hand tightened
  grimly upon the barrel of his rifle, but he restrained himself. After all,
  that was not what he must do. There were strange movements of repulsion in
  his heart of hearts at the very thought of firing upon a human being. He
  turned his back on the scene with a murmur of disgust and headed for
  Peter.</p>

  <p>Once in the saddle, he struck out along the hillside at a fast clip. It
  would have been difficult going for another horse at a trot, but Peter
  negotiated the rough ground at a round gallop. He had not spent six years
  following the wild trails where Tom and the grizzly led him, without gaining
  some of the instincts and the powers of foot of a mountain sheep. He knew by
  the look of the soil where it would slide, and where the apparently loose
  gravel would hold fast. He knew how to weave among the trees without
  diminishing his pace. He knew how to conserve his strength in the climbs, how
  to go deftly in a serpentine course down abrupt slopes, and then to whirl in
  a wild gallop through the valley.</p>

  <p>That was what he did now as they cut across the mountain slope, then
  doubled back over the peak, went down the farther slope, opened up at a
  terrific speed across the more level going in the lowlands, and climbed
  again, toward evening, into the ragged cliffs, as though they were heading
  definitely north after the feint of the day before into the east.</p>

  <p>As the early twilight came, still bright on the upper mountains, they
  reached a swift, shallow, snowfed stream. Into that icy water he rode Peter,
  with Jerry grunting behind. Though the grizzly had been distanced across the
  low country, he had more than made up for the lost ground when it came to
  climbing in the rough hills. Up the stream they waded for a distance, came
  out on the same side of the stream on Which they had entered, and circled
  back toward the creek, which they entered close to the first point, then
  crossed to the farther side, Jerry following behind the stallion, and made
  another swift semicircle on the farther shore. Around they went again in a
  larger circle, then followed with weaving in and out, and finally dropped
  straight into the stream, stumbling over the boulders, passed up a branching
  runlet hardly large enough for them to walk in, and came out again at the
  head of the runlet upon some great, flat slabs of granite where no visible
  print of their trail could be left, and where the thin and wandering current
  of snow waters would probably wipe out most of the scent for a considerable
  distance.</p>

  <p>Over these rocks they went for some distance and at length struck off
  again through the broken ridge country. It might take an hour, it might take
  a day before the trailers located the solution to that puzzle, though by this
  time they knew many of his tactics by heart.</p>

  <p>He had traveled from the peak of the mountain, where he found the sooty
  stone, over a long, loosely irregular arc. Now he headed, on the almost level
  plateau, straight across the short chord of that arc and pressed on
  remorselessly, in spite of the growls and grumblings of the grizzly, until,
  in the utter dark, he reached the place where, so he felt, the murderer of
  Dick Walker must have camped before him. There he ventured on his fire.
  There, after a time, he took a turn in his blankets and fell soundly
  asleep.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch30"
     name="ch30"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

  <p class="first">There was no sign of sunrise when he wakened suddenly and
rose to his feet
  the next morning. But the iron will had roused him after a scant four hours
  of rest. It was enough.</p>

  <p>Where the spring water collected in a deep, black-faced pool a little
  farther down the mountainside, he took his morning plunge. He came back to
  his own new- kindled camp fire, surrounded by rocks, and started the coffee.
  Then he tended to his shaving.</p>

  <p>It was the one habit which he had learned from men, for when his beard
  began to grow, he had envied the smooth faces of the men he saw, and finally,
  spying on a camp fire in the early morning, he had seen a man shaving. That
  same razor and strap and brush and soap were mysteriously stolen from the
  lucky prospector's kit that night while he slept. In its place there was left
  a bundle of four fine fox skins. And so it was that Tom learned shaving. He
  had envied the short hair of men, also, but he could not cut his own unless
  he hacked it off close to the roots with his knife and left a ragged mass
  covering his head.</p>

  <p>Bathed and shaven and breakfasted, he was still too early to take the
  trail. But in a few moments the quick-coming mountain dawn began, and he
  looked about him. All around the place were the trails of men and dogs and
  horses. The pursuers had rested for a time at this point in the trail, well
  wearied by the labors of that day, as they might have reason to be. But what
  would they feel when they discovered that that long loop to the side was
  merely a detour?</p>

  <p>Tom smiled as he thought of their faces. His ears rang in imagination with
  their profound oaths. Then he headed down the mountain slope.</p>

  <p>He went on until noon, still carefully maintaining that line which he had
  cast ahead from the crest of the mountain toward the higher peaks. Another
  deer fell to his rifle, then, with a long-range shot. He paused to cook and
  eat and let Jerry feed his full. It was a two-hour halt, but two hours of
  rest in the middle of the day is an excellent measure on a long trail. When
  he began again in the middle of the afternoon, it was at a pace as brisk as
  that of his morning spurt. An hour more, and he came on what seemed to him
  another proof that he was following the correct trail. It was the indubitable
  sign of a camp fire which had spread into the surrounding brush and almost
  started a forest fire, save that the camper had beaten it out in the nick of
  time before it spread to the trees.</p>

  <p>No rains could hide the scars of that fire. And on went Tom, confident,
  now, that he was running in the right direction. He struck up above timber
  line, crossed a great range of gleaming stone cliffs, and dropped onto the
  farther side. Was he still on the line, he wondered, as he camped that
  evening?</p>

  <p>Next day he went on again, and it was in the middle of the morning that he
  came on the first continuous trail. Well worked in along the moist bank of a
  stream, he found the print of a horse and a dog, and yonder was still the
  dent of a man's knee where he had stopped to fill his canteen.</p>

  <p>Of course, it might not be the man he wanted, but from that point he ran
  on snatches of the trail repeatedly. As a matter of fact, he had traveled in
  two days as far as the other had traveled in four, and the trail was
  freshening every moment. Now Jerry began to take an interest, and Tom
  welcomed his assistance, for there is no more able trailer than a clever
  grizzly. Men have worked to follow them for the sake of a photograph for two
  weeks or a month at a time, and never sighted them. More often than not, they
  have turned back to dog the hunter's steps! And at the end of the trail
  puzzle he finds that the great brute has spent half the day working trail
  problems for the man to solve, and the other half has perched himself in a
  safe lookout to enjoy the labors of his enemy.</p>

  <p>So it was that Jerry regarded the tracks of the man, the horse, and the
  dogs, got their faint scent in his sensitive nostrils, and finally forged
  ahead, showing the way to Tom. It was far surer to follow Jerry's lead, but
  it was slower. Yet Tom, full of anxiety lest the posses overtake him again,
  allowed the bear to take his own course, only urging him on now and
  again.</p>

  <p>Another day went over his head, and now the trail was so clear that even
  an amateur could have deciphered it. The horse was shod on three feet. The
  fourth was bare, and a chunk was broken out of one side of the overgrown
  hoofs - the right fore. The man wore boots with high heels, sloping to a
  rather meager supporting surface, like modification of cowboy boots, well
  nigh. Wherever he got down from the saddle, he left prints which showed that
  both heels were badly turned over and leaned to the outside.</p>

  <p>He was a big man, Tom observed by the length of the stride. He was a heavy
  man, as he could tell by the depth of the impressions. That it was a horse as
  small as the rider was large, was an equally clear deduction and taken from
  similar testimony. Moreover, it was an expert shot in whose trail Tom rode.
  He could tell that by scars which he had found on a slender sapling at one
  side of the trail. The tree had been carefully cut in two with five shots,
  placed so nicely, side by side and in a perfectly straight line, that each
  orifice neatly touched the next.</p>

  <p>Tom examined the tree with care. The caliber of the bullets was
  forty-five. He had done that shooting at thirty yards with a Colt, then. And
  Tom himself could not have improved upon it. Still more, they must have been
  quick, casual shots such as a man aims to make such that hand and eye are in
  faultless practice.</p>

  <p>No sooner did the trail become clear than Tom increased his pace, and the
  fear of the mellow-tongued voices of the dogs of the posse began to disappear
  when, in the middle of a sunshiny afternoon, he came on indisputable proofs
  that the trail which he was following through a pine forest had been made
  only an hour or so before, at the most. If this were indeed the man who had
  killed Dick Walker, he must be essentially lazy, for, after the first spurt
  away from the site of the murder, he had gone ahead with marches so short
  that a child could have made them on foot from day to day. Tom could have
  covered four times the average distance and never been hard pressed by the
  labor. But here were the pine needles recently pressed down and unlifted by
  any wind since the footprints were made. Surely, the goal could not be far
  off.</p>

  <p>At least, he would take no chances. He galloped Peter to one side half a
  mile or more and left him in a small hollow thickly fenced with trees. There
  he left him with Jerry, secure in the knowledge that nothing would make them
  budge until he returned and gave the order for a move. Then he struck off
  through the woods at a run, with his revolver and cartridge belt only. He cut
  back to the trail of the man and horse and dog. Along this he continued
  running for a mile until the barking of a dog not a hundred yards away caused
  him to slacken his pace.</p>

  <p>He came almost at once to a small clearing among the tall trees where a
  great dog which was apparently a cross between wolf and hound - heavy as the
  one and long legged as the other; a huge, fierce brute - was raging around
  the bottom of a small sapling in the top of which a tree squirrel was
  perched, chattering with terror. At one side stood a small pinto with the
  sweat mark still dark on his back and the saddle thrown down just inside the
  open door of the log cabin. Over the cabin, smoke was curling from the
  chimney. But the man of the house was standing by the tree, laughing at the
  terror of the squirrel and the wild fury of the dog.</p>

  <p>At sight of that man, the blood of Tom turned to ice, for it was the man
  who had died in his cave come to life! There was the same gigantic body.
  There was the same dense growth of black and curling beard. There was the
  same pair of keen, wickedly active little eyes. He stood in riding boots very
  much like a cowpuncher's, but slightly wider at the toes. He wore overalls
  and a flannel shirt which had once been red, but which was now faded to a
  sort of grisly pink. It was open at the neck. His outfit was fittingly
  completed with a rag of what had once been a black, felt hat. As to the age
  of the big man, Tom judged him in spite of the heavy beard to be only in his
  late thirties - the very prime of his muscular life. But, first and last, he
  noted the boots, the heels of which had sagged well outward under his
  gigantic weight.</p>

  <p>He was busy now bending the sapling. He did it with one hand, with a
  suggestion of strength in reserve that appalled Tom. He brought down the top
  of the sturdy young tree until the great hound, with a bound, almost reached
  the tree squirrel. The latter would run back down the trunk, squealing in
  terror, only to recoil as it neared the hand of the man. And so the dog
  barked and raged, and the man laughed as though his joy in the torture was
  almost more than he could endure.</p>

  <p>At length, a hard shake dislodged the squirrel with such force that it was
  flung far through the air, struck the ground hard, a short distance from the
  tree behind which Tom was standing, and then raced for safety in the same
  tree. The dog, meantime, had darted instantly in pursuit with a whine of joy,
  and Tom saw that in another instant the great jaws would clamp over that
  small, terrified morsel of flesh.</p>

  <p>He could not resist, though it was a wild, incautious thing to do, as he
  knew. He leaped from his covert with a shout. The dog veered from him, and
  the squirrel took advantage of that moment to gain the tree and dart up into
  its branches. There it ran out on a limb, high enough for safety, and
  chattered its contempt and disgust in the general direction of the dog.</p>

  <p>The latter began leaping as high as it could in the air, howling dismally
  in disappointment. But Tom had no longer any thought for either the squirrel
  whose life he had saved or the dog. He looked up to the master of the latter
  and found that he was facing the muzzle of a revolver.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch31"
     name="ch31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

  <p class="first">There are some men whose minds grow hazy and dim in the
crises. There are
  some whose mental acuteness is a thousandfold redoubled. And Tom Parks was
  one of these. He saw every detail of the body of the big man. He saw the very
  bending of the forefinger around the trigger. And, with the same glance, he
  looked into the mind of the fellow, down to his heart of hearts, and what he
  saw was relentless brutality - an unending store of it. He saw cool and quick
  decision, too, and the readiness for action which marks the fighting man,
  made such by nature and trained to perfection.</p>

  <p>"Just get your hands up over your head, son," the other was saying. "Just
  get 'em up there," he drawled with murderous slowness through his teeth, "and
  keep 'em there!"</p>

  <p>If there was hesitation in Tom's mind, it did not outlast the fifth part
  of a second. Then he drew his hands up and stood with them raised obediently
  above his head.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the big man, "say your prayers."</p>

  <p>Tom set his teeth. He was incredulous, and yet there was a wicked devil in
  the eye of the other which told him that anything was possible. He saw the
  forefinger increase its pressure. The gun exploded. But at the last instant
  the muzzle was twitched up. Something dropped with a light crashing through
  the branches of the tree behind Tom.</p>

  <p>"Well, Tiger, eat'er up," said the big man calmly, and he added to Tom,
  lowering his revolver and dropping it into his holster: "You've got your
  nerve, stranger. You're steady enough!"</p>

  <p>"I thought that was the end," said Tom with equal quiet.</p>

  <p>"All right," and the other grinned. "You had something coming to you for
  robbing Tiger of that squirrel. He had the squirrel coming, and you had
  something coming, too. Now I guess that we're quits. You can put your hands
  down if you want, partner."</p>

  <p>There was no misunderstanding the attitude of this giant. He was perfectly
  willing for Tom to go for a gun if the latter so desired. His confidence in
  his ability to get out his own Colt beforehand was profound. There was even a
  malignant twinkle in his eye which suggested that he would welcome such a
  crash.</p>

  <p>But Tom was not ready to fight, certainly not ready to kill. In the first
  place, what he wanted from this man was not his death but all that he knew
  concerning the murder of Dick Walker, and, now that he confronted the fellow,
  it occurred to Tom for the first time that the extraction of a confession
  might be an affair of considerable difficulty. He had followed the trail
  blindly. Now that one half of his work was done, there was another half
  before him, about the accomplishment of which he had no ideas. Besides, the
  mere physical subduing of the big man seemed an impossible task. Behind him
  the dog was champing and growling noisily at the body of the poor squirrel.
  It seemed indicative of the power of him of the black beard. That might not
  be the only death in the clearing before night came.</p>

  <p>"Now that we're friends," said the big man, "who might you be?"</p>

  <p>"My name is Tom Parks."</p>

  <p>"I'm Bill," said the other. "Glad to know you, Tom."</p>

  <p>But he made no attempt to shake hands. The right hand rested on his hip
  carelessly - and near the butt of his gun.</p>

  <p>"How come you by this way?" he continued.</p>

  <p>"I was lonely," said Tom.</p>

  <p>The other grinned, but made no direct response.</p>

  <p>"And you come on foot, too?" he said.</p>

  <p>"No; on a horse," said Tom.</p>

  <p>"Where's the horse?"</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd leave him a little ways off," answered Tom, "until I'd
  scouted around a bit."</p>

  <p>The big man ceased smiling.</p>

  <p>"You wasn't just sure what sort of folks I might be, eh?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know you," said Tom as gravely as before. "I thought that I'd
  take a look and see for myself."</p>

  <p>"Till you saw Tiger take a dive for the squirrel - then you showed your
  hand?"</p>

  <p>"That was it," said Tom. "I hadn't intended to."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Bill, "Tiger has the squirrel!"</p>

  <p>He waited, apparently ready to be taken up on this score, but, since he
  was not challenged, he went on:</p>

  <p>"I'm glad to see you, right enough. But if you see anything around these
  diggings that you take a fancy to, just pay me in coin, will you, and not in
  fur?"</p>

  <p>Tom started, and the other laughed heavily, but not with such abandon that
  his right hand stirred from its strategic position or his eyes for an instant
  left off their watch.</p>

  <p>"Sure," he said. "I knew you the minute I clamped eyes on you. There ain't
  so many that go around with long hair and home-made clothes these days. I
  knew you pronto. There ain't another man in the mountains that you could be
  mistook for. What's up, Tom?"</p>

  <p>"I was tired of running away from men," said Tom idly. "I thought I'd like
  to sit down and talk with a man who was in the same position with me."</p>

  <p>"The same position? How come?" exclaimed Bill, instantly suspicious.</p>

  <p>Tom smiled.</p>

  <p>"You don't seem to be very near other houses," he said. "Some people may
  come near your house, but not very many!"</p>

  <p>He turned and waved to the ragged crests of the mountains which on every
  side pitched up against the sky. When he faced Bill again, he found that the
  latter was studying him like a hawk. But he wavered in his decision for only
  an instant. Then he shrugged his heavy shoulders and grinned.</p>

  <p>"All right, kid," he said. "I guess you know," and he winked, but
  immediately scowled and added: "Not that they got anything on me, but I'm
  tired of having them watch me. I'm tired of being bothered. Can't show my
  face inside of a town without having the sheriff come around and get clubby.
  Why, blast their hearts, they ain't got a thing that they can prove on me.
  All they got is the hope of proving something. But I ain't anybody's
  fool!"</p>

  <p>He laughed again, more heartily than before.</p>

  <p>"Come on inside," he said..</p>

  <p>Tom nodded and noted that the other waited for him to pass first and then
  followed half a step to the rear, keeping his guest always under his eye.</p>

  <p>"And what about the bear," he said. "I'd sure like to see that bear. Or is
  that just a lie they been telling about you having a bear that you had
  tamed."</p>

  <p>"It's true," said Tom.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be hanged," said Bill. "We'll go take a look at that bear
  after a while. How about eating now?"</p>

  <p>"Good," said Tom, but the walls of his stomach were cleaving together with
  anxiety. "You eat while I talk, I ate this noon."</p>

  <p>"You - well, son, ain't it time to eat again?"</p>

  <p>Tom eyed him in wonder, and then he remembered. Other men sat down to eat
  three times a day. One meal in twenty-four hours was privation to them,
  whereas two was a luxury to him.</p>

  <p>"Not till tomorrow," he said. "I can't eat till then."</p>

  <p>Bill shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You're queer, right enough," he decided. "But I can eat for two any day.
  Are you taking off your gat? It's a pile more comfortable sitting
  around."</p>

  <p>Tom took the hint and stripped off his gun belt and hung it on a peg in
  the wall. But Bill, while he busied himself taking his food from the frying
  pan, where it had been simmering, kept his revolver on the edge of the table
  nearest to him. It was a wretched imitation of a table - two planks joined
  together over two sawhorses. But, at that, it was almost the only piece of
  sawed timber in the cabin. The rest was entirely logs. In a corner was a
  grimy heap of blankets on the floor. There were a few rusted traps; some
  shirts and boots thrown in another corner; two rifles, a shotgun, and two
  revolvers hanging on the wall, apparently all well cared for; some sacks of
  flour and other provisions, a bit mildewed around the bottoms; and two stumps
  leveled on bottom and top had been rolled into the house as chairs.
  Altogether, it was the dirtiest and most uncomfortable living quarters that
  Tom had ever seen. The fire, gleaming through the cracks of the stove, was
  the one cheerful center of interest.</p>

  <p>The great hound came stalking in, snarled with twitching lips at Tom's
  moccasins, and then lay down near the stove and glared at Tom out of fierce,
  red eyes. And whenever the eyes of Tom fell upon him, his lips twitched
  again, and a growl formed vaguely in the deeps of his throat.</p>

  <p>"The dog don't like you," said Bill, as he arranged his coffee and ham and
  fried bread on the table in tin dishes and sat down in front of it, with the
  revolver still near his plate. "He don't like you, and, come to think of it,
  you can't noways blame him. He figures that you tried to cheat him out of
  that squirrel when he had a good chance to catch the little devil. You can't
  blame him for that, eh?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Tom.</p>

  <p>At the sound of his voice, the dog growled heavily.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" thundered Bill, and kicked savagely at the head of the dog. But
  that brute had apparently learned to dodge with expert adroitness. He moved
  an inch out of range, shifted his eyes to the face of his master with a whine
  of abject submission, and again resumed his occupation of glaring at Tom.</p>

  <p>His presence greatly complicated matters. Bill alone was a handful and
  more. He was larger than any man Tom had ever seen. Towering six feet and
  five inches from the ground, with some two hundred and fifty pounds of mighty
  muscle, trained hard by the mountain climbing and the mountain work, he was
  the very picture of Hercules. The meal which was before him was enough in
  quantity to have fed Tom heartily for two days. But the giant devoured it in
  great sections. The cords of his huge wrist were as bulky and broad and hard
  as the tendon of Achilles in lesser men, well-nigh. When he chewed his food,
  the muscles swelled out along his jaw and made his beard bristle. In
  addition, Tom had seen enough to know that he was lightning quick with hand
  and eye. And, if it came to a hand-to-hand fight, he would be at a more
  decided disadvantage in having to confront this terrible foeman in such
  cramped quarters. Altogether, though he had amply proved the superiority of
  his own strength over the power of ordinary men, and though he would have
  been confident even now had there been a chance for him to exercise his
  agility and his endurance over a broader battlefield, he seriously doubted
  and almost despaired as he looked upon those enormous hands and those
  blunt-tipped fingers. But, in addition to all these disadvantages, there was
  the dog.</p>

  <p>That huge brute, as large among his kind, almost, as his master was among
  men, had formed a confirmed hatred for the visitor. At the first sign of a
  quarrel with the master, he would fling himself at Tom with teeth large
  enough and strong enough to tear the throat out of a man at a single bite.
  Altogether, it seemed that Tom was confronted with insuperable odds.</p>

  <p>And yet action he must have, now or never. Somewhere back in the forest,
  where the yellow light of the late afternoon was sifting through the trees,
  the posse was coming apace to overtake him. And once they were there, they
  would not wait to listen to his accusations. Nine chances out often, they
  would simply shoot him on the spot, or else string him up to a nearby tree.
  Before they arrived, he must have proof to show to the world that Bill was
  the murderer - or, indeed, was he?</p>

  <p>If he were not, it was a lost trail, and with that lost trail was lost all
  hope of seeing Gloria again. Poor Tom passed the back of his hand across his
  furrowed forehead.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch32"
     name="ch32"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

  <p class="first">"I've heard tell something about the way you made a fool
out of the gang
  that that tenderfoot took up into the hills," Bill was saying. "I've heard
  tell about it! But you ain't the only one that they've tried to hunt down and
  ain't been able to. No, kid, you ain't the only one. I had a brother once.
  They started after him, a good hundred of 'em, but they never got him."</p>

  <p>"How long did your brother keep them away?" asked Tom with sudden
  interest.</p>

  <p>"How long?" said Bill. "Why, they didn't never catch him! Eight, nine
  years ago, along in the spring, he come up into the hills with about a
  million of 'em after him. But they never put a hand on him. He got clean of
  'em all!"</p>

  <p>He laughed and beat his hand on the table until the tins jumped and
  rattled.</p>

  <p>"I sure wish that I'd been around to see how the old boy managed it! He
  was a hard one, he was. And he just stepped out and walked away from the
  whole crew of 'em!"</p>

  <p>"Eight, nine years," said Tom, his idea growing more certain, though he
  still wanted the proof more complete. "And he's been away all this time?"</p>

  <p>"He faded out so complete," said Bill, "that nobody ever seen him again,
  not even me. But I figure that I know where he went. He had some pals in
  Australia. That's a good country for a gent that wants freedom. That's where
  he must of gone!"</p>

  <p>Tom drew a deep breath. For all the years which lay between, he felt again
  the heavy hand of the giant in his cave, and heard the deep, growling voice.
  And Bill was like a larger reincarnation.</p>

  <p>"When I got tired having them fool with me," said Bill, "I remembered what
  he done. I came the same direction, and I done the same thing!"</p>

  <p>But here Tom shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not quite the same," he said.</p>

  <p>The joy was stricken from the face of Bill.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" he grunted, and, staring at Tom, his brute face worked with
  astonishment and the beginnings of fear.</p>

  <p>"I went down to Turnbull," said Tom, "and while I was there I heard men
  talking about you."</p>

  <p>"The devil you did!" thundered Bill, and instinctively his huge hand
  gripped the butt of the revolver, and his glance roved through the door and
  across the clearing. "Nobody's ever seen me," he continued fiercely. "Nobody
  but you!" And he centered a malignant gaze upon Tom.</p>

  <p>"I heard them talking about the killing of Dick Walker," said Tom.
  "Someone must have seen you in the hills, because they talked about a man of
  your size. And I don't suppose that there is another like you in the
  mountains around here."</p>

  <p>"Nor around no place," said Bill proudly. "Gents of my size don't come
  along in pairs. But what did they say?"</p>

  <p>"They said that not many men were capable of beating Dick Walker. That was
  why they thought it must have been you."</p>

  <p>"It must of been somebody that knew me back in Elkhorn," said Bill
  thoughtfully. "I had a falling out with Walker there just before I had to
  leave town. But I left word for Dick that I'd get the skunk sooner or later.
  I seen 'em make that camp and pile up the stuff after you'd made a fool of
  'em and snaked their hosses away. So I went down and called on Walker. They
  said that nobody could stand up to Walker in a square and fair fight. But I
  done just that! It wasn't no murder. It was a fair killing. I beat him to the
  draw. That was all there was to it!"</p>

  <p>He spread out his great arms and grinned with a ghastly triumph.</p>

  <p>"It was close, at that," said Bill meditatively. "I heard his slug whisper
  by my ear while he was a-falling. He was dead when he pulled his trigger, but
  he shot straight enough, at that. Yep, Dick was a hard kid!"</p>

  <p>He nodded and chuckled. It was a horrible thing to Tom to see his
  exultation.</p>

  <p>"But they're coming hunting me?" said Bill suddenly. "D'you hear 'em say
  that?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Tom.</p>

  <p>"But what started you on my trail?"</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd find you. I found the shell you snapped out of the gun
  about a mile from the place. That gave me the line you'd traveled. I hit your
  fire on top of the mountain -"</p>

  <p>"You lie!" cried the giant. "It must of been washed away by the
  rains!"</p>

  <p>"One side of a stone was black with the soot of your fire," said Tom.</p>

  <p>The other grunted, and his little eyes opened with wonder.</p>

  <p>"You sure read a trail close," he said.</p>

  <p>"Then I came on," said Tom. "After a while, I came on your sign. You were
  taking your time, you know."</p>

  <p>"I can hurry when I want to," said Bill. "I can break their hearts easy
  enough if they press me. But I didn't figure that I had any call to hurry
  right then. Otherwise, you wouldn't never have found me, son!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," said Tom.</p>

  <p>"But where one gent can follow, another can follow. And by you coming over
  the same way, it'll be like a paved road for the rest of 'em!" groaned Bill.
  "I wish you'd minded your own business and kept away! Why'd you want to horn
  in and spoil my game? Did I ask you to come down here and call on me like a
  fool?"</p>

  <p>Wild with anger, he fingered the butt of his revolver, and the sweat came
  cold on the forehead of Tom; yet be managed to meet the glare of Bill
  squarely.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he said. "Shall I put some wood in the stove?"</p>

  <p>"Go do it," snapped Bill.</p>

  <p>Tom rose leisurely, stretched, looked out of the doorway into the sunlit
  clearing, and listened again. Far, far away, like a ghost on the steady wind,
  he had heard the baying of a pack of dogs. Why did not Bill hear it? But when
  he turned, he saw that the face of the larger man was not intent in
  listening. Perhaps his ears were less keenly attuned. At any rate, it meant
  that the time of Tom was short.</p>

  <p>He turned to the stove, took off the lids, and then leaned to pick up a
  chunk of wood. He reached for the largest and heaviest stick, and as his
  fingers closed on it, something like, the passing of a shadow, a chill
  sweeping over his spine, made him wince away just as the hand and the heavy,
  clubbed revolver of Bill shot down past his head.</p>

  <p>Full of suspicion of this unbidden guest, Bill had not been able to get
  rid of him with a bullet so long as he was unarmed, but the moment his back
  was turned the conscience of Bill was at ease. Only that lightning dodge to
  the side had saved Tom from a crushed skull.</p>

  <p>He whirled like a cat and struck at the flash of the gun. The billet of
  wood hit the hand - the gun was knocked spinning toward the door and through
  it. The roar of Bill, as he jerked back his wounded hand, was loud as the
  roar of Jerry in a moment of fury. Tom sprang back, appalled - and received
  the teeth of Tiger as the big brute fastened his grip on Tom's leg.</p>

  <p>Yet he dared venture hardly a glance at the dog. One look, and he struck
  with all his force. The heavy stick landed squarely across the eyes of Tiger
  and dropped him with a groan, but the blow snapped the stick across and left
  Tom unarmed to meet the rush of the giant.</p>

  <p>All the advantage of his agility was gone. In an instant the giant had
  closed on him. He could only duck his head under a blow that would have
  knocked him senseless, never to reawaken. Then the huge arms were wrapped
  around him. But, in ducking with lowered head, he had thrown his left elbow
  before him. The enveloping pressure of the big man drove that elbow like a
  spear into the bones of his chest.</p>

  <p>The pain made Bill shout, and in that instant Tom whirled out of the grip
  of the giant. But so tremendous was the strength of Bill that the tattered
  remnants of Tom's buckskin shirt remained in his hands, and Tom was naked to
  the waist. Bill snatched a rifle from the wall - no time to level and aim it
  - but he flung it at Tom's head. It flew past him as he swerved. And instead
  of running, as the giant had expected, Tom darted in and flashed both hands
  into the giant's face.</p>

  <p>Trained by many a bruising combat with Jerry to strike speedily beyond
  conception and with pile-driver force, Tom raised a red welt on the cheek of
  Bill with one of those blows, and the other slashed the flesh over a
  cheekbone and let the blood flow in a stream down his face.</p>

  <p>And Bill struck in turn with all his might. But he had been stung, and
  hurt men strike short. Just past the face of Tom his blow swept, and the
  long, darting arms of the smaller man rammed home again into the face of
  Bill. In either hand there was force enough to have dropped a common man,
  stunned and helpless, but the solid jaw of Bill took the blows and
  telegraphed only a faint shock and a small pain to that small, brute
  brain.</p>

  <p>But he was blind with utter rage. He came in, head down, to crush Tom
  against the wall. It was like trying to corner a wild cat. He struck thin air
  and battered himself against the logs. Before he could turn, he received a
  blow like that of a four-pound sledge swung by a strong hand, landing just
  beneath his ear.</p>

  <p>And this time he was staggering. He reeled around and met a volley of
  cutting blows that brought a fresh trickle from his nose and cut his mouth.
  But here again, strokes that would have stunned a prize fighter were merely
  like the sting of a spur to Bill. His slow brain quickened into life again.
  He saw clearly, and knew that he could never stand at a distance and exchange
  blows with this shadowy enemy who seemed to carry a hammerhead in either
  fist. He lowered his head and came in again, but more slowly, his arms
  outstretched to grip his enemy.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch33"
     name="ch33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

  <p class="first">For every foot the giant advanced, a pair of driving blows
crashed against
  his head, and just as he thought he was sure to close and set his crushing
  hands on Tom, the latter flung himself to the side. One hand gripped his
  shoulder. He tore himself out of the hold, though those terrible fingers
  flayed off his skin as though they were iron pincers. A crimson trickle ran
  down his body as he whirled and struck again.</p>

  <p>Bill swept a roundabout swing at the head of Tom. It was like striking at
  a bobbing cork. The blow went wild, and his ribs sagged, an instant later, as
  both fists whipped home into his body.</p>

  <p>This was far other than blows to the head. His fat abdomen was not meant
  to withstand such shocks. A mist of sickness clouded his eyes. With a groan
  he rushed once more, and once more his arms closed on empty air.</p>

  <p>He was despairing when he turned. His face had been cut to ribbons. One
  eye was almost closed. Blood trickled over the other, and still that terrible
  phantom swayed and dodged before him, and when he struck his arm lunged
  through nothingness.</p>

  <p>If only he could get to close quarters! He plunged in again. And again he
  saw the smaller man waver in a feint to one side, then plunge to the other,
  but as he leaped his foot landed on the barrel of the fallen rifle, which
  slipped and rolled under his weight. Down went Tom and sprang up again like a
  bounding rubber ball. But it was too late. That instant had given Bill time
  to close, and now with a savage shout of joy he flung himself on Tom. One arm
  passed around the body of Tom.</p>

  <p>The other hand fastened on his throat, and he whined and sobbed with
  hysterical joy.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Tom that the tendons of his throat were being sprung asunder
  from the bone. The blood rushed into his face. His eyes swelled out. In vain
  he clubbed his fists and beat them into that bleeding face. The giant laughed
  through his teeth and increased his pressure.</p>

  <p>A sound of roaring, tumbling water poured into the ears of Tom. Yet he
  fought swiftly, even though a veil was falling over his senses. He pressed
  one arm up between himself and the chest of Bill. He passed that arm over the
  wrist which was beneath his chin. And on that leverage he cast a resistless
  pressure by leaping off the floor and spinning his whole weight into the air.
  The grip was torn from his throat.</p>

  <p>He pitched to the floor, but the giant had toppled, also, and they
  regained their feet at the same time and stood swaying and exhausted. In
  three brief minutes of battle they had poured out all their strength.</p>

  <p>Then it was that condition began to tell in favor of Tom. To be sure, Bill
  was well conditioned himself, but he had never known the life of exposure and
  hardship which was Tom's average lot. His muscles had not been turned into so
  much seasoned whipcord. The exertions had sapped his wind. But two deep
  breaths dragged into Tom's straining lungs revived him once more.</p>

  <p>He slipped aside from the next rush of the giant, whirled, and met him
  with a blow behind which was his entire power. His fist landed just beside
  the point of the big man's chin. The shock of it sent a numb tingle to Tom's
  shoulder, but it stopped Bill in his tracks.</p>

  <p>The left fist followed the right, made doubly strong by an electric spark
  of hope. And he cried out softly with joy as the giant gave back, with a
  groan of despair and bewilderment.</p>

  <p>He lunged again and suddenly, with the terror and the joy of a gambler
  taking a last chance. Tom stood his ground, his back to the wall, and struck
  again with all his might. And again the blow landed on the point of the
  giant's jaw.</p>

  <p>Constant hammering will make the stanchest stone crumble. And while the
  first strokes had hardly fazed Bill, the continual dinting of those iron-hard
  fists had had an effect. A numb area had been growing in his brain. And now
  it seemed to Tom that the knees of the big man sagged a little under the
  weight of the punch. At least, it stopped him short again.</p>

  <p>He swung his thick arm, and, taking another chance, Tom allowed it to
  land. But there was still weight enough in that tired arm to lift him off his
  feet, as the fist struck his chest and sent him crashing into the wall.</p>

  <p>With a gasp he rebounded, braced himself, and drove both fists again into
  the face of Bill. And again he stopped the big man!</p>

  <p>He discovered that there was a world of difference between hitting while
  on the run and striking while both his feet were planted. He saw the head of
  the giant roll, and crimson spattered out of the clogged wet beard as he
  struck. He came in a little, and again, with feet spread and planted, he
  struck. The jaw of Bill drooped. His eyes grew blank. Vaguely he swung at the
  head of Tom, and the latter stepped in and shot his own fist inside the arc
  of that swaying arm. The blow landed fair and true on the jaw. That jaw was
  loose now. Tom felt it give horribly, as though the bones were broken, and
  Bill slumped to his knees, his back against the wall. It was a grim thing to
  do, but there could be no chances taken with this brute of a man. Tom
  crouched and struck again, mercilessly. The blow drove the loose head back
  against the logs. And Bill toppled forward on his face and lay immense and
  sprawling on the floor.</p>

  <p>As Tom stood above him, weak-kneed all at once, and gasping for breath,
  hardly able to realize that of his own power he had been able to beat the
  giant to insensibility, something which had been forming in his brain as a
  vague worry now grew clear and defined. It was the baying of a dog pack
  growing momentarily closer! The posse was near at hand.</p>

  <p>He ran to the door and closed and bolted it. He went back to the fallen
  body, which was not groaning. With a cord he secured the wrists and then the
  feet of the big man. Last, he turned the giant upon his back, then tugged the
  inert figure to a sitting posture, the back against the wall.</p>

  <p>Bill opened his eyes and looked wildly about him. And he glared at Tom
  with a slow comprehension of what had happened. His jaw sagged as though
  another blow had landed in the clotted beard at the point of his chin.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said finally, "that was a pretty good bout."</p>

  <p>He tried to laugh. The result was a horrible mimicry of mirth. It ended as
  he saw the grim face of Tom and the naked torso striped with crimson which
  had flowed from Tom's torn throat.</p>

  <p>"Stand up," said Tom.</p>

  <p>The giant rose obediently, swaying on his bound feet.</p>

  <p>First Tom reerected the fallen table.</p>

  <p>"Now sit down there," he said, pointing to a stool which he had placed
  near the table.</p>

  <p>Bill hopped clumsily on his bound feet to the stool and sat down. And
  Tiger, beginning to waken from his swoon, groaned feebly. That sound was
  echoed by an ear-filling burst of music from the approaching pack, and Bill
  gasped with terror.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" he cried.</p>

  <p>"The posse," said Tom. "They're coming to get me for the killing of Dick
  Walker. But they'll get you instead. Bill, you're going to write on the top
  of that table: 'I killed Dick Walker.' And after that you'll put your name
  under it. Do you hear?"</p>

  <p>The tongue of Bill lolled out across his lips. He stared, fascinated, at
  Tom.</p>

  <p>"D'you want me to put the rope around my neck?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"If I hadn't dodged you a little while ago," said Tom quietly, "they would
  have run you down for my murder. It's all one, Bill. Write on that table.
  Here's some charcoal that will do."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he passed a rope around Bill's waist, fastened his left hand
  to it, and loosened the right. He picked his own revolver out of the holster
  hanging on the wall. He leveled it at the big man.</p>

  <p>"Write!" he commanded.</p>

  <p>But Bill, shuddering, shook his head. The baying of the pack came crashing
  through the forest. There was hardly a minute left to Tom. Another thought
  came to him. The poker when he opened the stove had been allowed to tip into
  the fire. He lifted it out. The end was red-hot. He knew that Jerry dreaded
  fire with a consummate fear. Might not this huge beast of a man have the same
  fear?</p>

  <p>He leveled the white, gleaming end of the poker close to the forehead of
  Bill.</p>

  <p>"Write," he commanded, "or I'll write with this in your face."</p>

  <p>"No, no!" groaned Bill. "Lord! Get that thing away. I'll write!"</p>

  <p>And, with sagging jaw, whining like a beaten dog, he scratched the words
  across the surface of the table: I killed Dick Walker, Bill
McKenzie.</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch34"
     name="ch34"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

  <p class="first">Lest he should erase those precious words with a sweep of
the hand, Tom
  fastened both hands behind Bill again. Then he stepped to the door of the
  cabin, threw it open, and stood outside, near the wall of the little house,
  just as the tumult of dogs poured out from among the trees and streamed
  across the clearing toward him. And, behind him, he heard the voices of men
  and the crashing of their horses among the trees.</p>

  <p>As for the dog pack, it recoiled from this human quarry and stood about
  him in a loose semicircle, snarling and howling to show that the enemy was at
  bay. A moment more, and the hunters themselves came.</p>

  <p>They came in a straggling body, a full score of them, and others,
  distanced by the hard going, were still busily working through the more
  distant woods. What Tom saw first was the face of Hank Jeffries, with Si
  Bartlett riding at his side. At sight of Tom at bay, Jeffries jerked out a
  gun. But Bartlett knocked down his hand.</p>

  <p>"Steady up, Hank!" cried Bartlett. "He's surrendered. He'd rather get his
  neck stretched than be salted away with lead. Sheriff, this is your lucky
  day!"</p>

  <p>This to the sheriff, as the latter burst out of the forest on a sweating
  horse. And when he saw what prize had been reserved for him, he threw up his
  hat with a wild shout. After that, he flung himself out of the saddle and
  came forward, gun in hand - came slowly, as one who approaches a dangerous
  and treacherous quarry. But Tom stood without moving, leaning his naked
  shoulders against the wall of the cabin. The wind was blowing his long hair
  aside. The blood was drying on his chest, over which his long, brown arms
  were folded. It was no wonder that the sheriff came slowly.</p>

  <p>Sheriff Cassell halted and kicked a dog out of his way. The pack stopped
  its yelling. In the background, the swarm of horsemen stopped their shouting
  in wonder at what they saw.</p>

  <p>"Are you the man called Tom Parks?" asked the sheriff, conscious of the
  many eyes which rested on him; conscious, too, that this day he had made a
  name for himself among the most famous of man hunters, and that the job of
  sheriff was his for life if he wanted it.</p>

  <p>"I am Tom Parks," said a deep, quiet voice.</p>

  <p>The little sheriff took a step nearer.</p>

  <p>"I arrest you," he said, "in the name of the law. From this moment
  whatever you say may be used against you in court. Hold out your hands."</p>

  <p>They were obediently offered. Over the strong wrists the steel of the
  handcuffs was snapped. And every man in the posse breathed more freely now
  mat those sinewy hands were helpless.</p>

  <p>"Why am I arrested?" said Tom.</p>

  <p>"For horse stealing," said the sheriff slowly, "for burglary, for grand
  larceny and petty larceny, and for the murder of Dick Walker."</p>

  <p>"But for horse stealing first!" cried Hank Jeffries, who had thrown
  himself from the horse and stepped to the front, his lean face contorted with
  rage and satisfaction. "And that's enough to hang you!"</p>

  <p>And he struck Tom heavily in the face with his fist. The big man did not
  stir; only a small trickle of crimson went down his face from his mouth. But
  the sheriff turned raging upon Hank Jeffries.</p>

  <p>"Jeffries," he said, "get back in the crowd if you want to keep a whole
  skin. If Tom Parks had had his hands free, you'd rather of hit a mountain
  lion than hit him. If you or any other gent lays a hand on him again, I'll
  start talking with my gun. Get back and keep out of my sight!"</p>

  <p>There was a deep-throated murmur of approbation from the posse. They had
  pressed closer, those thin-faced cowpunchers, staring hungrily at the man who
  had baffled them so long on the trail, hardly able to understand how they
  could finally have run him down.</p>

  <p>"Who's inside that cabin?" asked the sheriff of Tom. "And what hell fire
  have you been raising now?"</p>

  <p>"See for yourself," said Tom.</p>

  <p>The sheriff stepped cautiously into the open door of the cabin and stood
  there rooted to the floor with a shout of astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Bill McKenzie!" he cried. "Boys, we've landed the two prize birds at one
  throw of the stone. Bill McKenzie!"</p>

  <p>There was a rush for the door of the cabin. Then came another shout as the
  sheriff read off the confession:</p>

  <p>"He killed Dick Walker!"</p>

  <p>Another voice was lifted, a huge voice of half-whining protest.</p>

  <p>"He forced me to write that, Sheriff. I swear I didn't have nothing to do
  with Walker's death. He got out a red-hot poker and said he'd jab it into my
  face unless I wrote that lie on the table and put my name to it."</p>

  <p>"Walker isn't the only one you'll answer for," said the sheriff sternly.
  "There's the killing of old man Wetherby you'll have to answer for, Bill.
  They've got the proofs of that. Come out here and face Parks, and we'll hear
  your story, both of you. Two in one day! And two like these! My luck has sure
  come in a lump! Sam, you've got a pair of bracelets. Clamp 'em on him. That's
  right. Now cut those ropes away from his feet. Walk out, McKenzie! There's
  been a man-sized fight in here."</p>

  <p>The crowd poured into the open. Huge McKenzie confronted his conqueror
  with the crimson clots still in his beard.</p>

  <p>"Tell your story, Bill," said the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"I was sitting in there peaceful -" began McKenzie.</p>

  <p>"You lie," snarled a voice in the crowd. "There never was a minute in your
  rotten life when you were peaceful."</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Harry," said the sheriff mildly. "Shut up and let him talk. Go
  on, Bill."</p>

  <p>"There ain't no use talking here," said Bill. "They ain't aiming to
  believe me."</p>

  <p>"I'll keep 'em quiet till you're through," said the sheriff, "no matter
  what they believe. Go on, Bill. Tell it to the face of Parks."</p>

  <p>"I was sitting in there all peaceful and quiet," said Bill again, "when
  this skunk come and threw a rope over me. I didn't have no chance. Then he
  told me he was going to make me write on the table that I'd killed Walker. He
  told me that he'd done that killing himself, and that you was after him and
  was sure to get him. I told him that I'd see him hanged before I wrote that
  lie down. He started in to beat me up. You see what he done to me? Finally,
  he got tired swinging his fists and started with a stick of wood. But I
  wouldn't give up till he knocked me out. When I come to, he tried a different
  gag. He got the poker red hot and said he'd jab it into my eyes unless I done
  what he wanted me to do. And that's what happened. I had to write. Sheriff,
  that's the truth and no mistake. I never done nothing about the killing of
  Dick Walker."</p>

  <p>There was a deep growl of anger from the crowd. They turned savage faces
  of hatred upon Tom. Fair play is the first thing that a Westerner
  demands.</p>

  <p>"Well, Parks," said the sheriff, "it's your turn to talk up and talk up
  loud, or I can't be holding these boys. Something tells me that they're
  getting a hankering for hanging you up to a branch. Turn loose and let's hear
  what you got to say for yourself."</p>

  <p>Tom looked quietly round on the circle of malignant faces. But in his
  heart there was a strange riot of emotions. If these men were infuriated, it
  was simply because they felt he had unjustly treated another man. And if
  there were such justice in them, it was something surely worth knowing about
  human nature.</p>

  <p>So he began his recital slowly with what Gloria Themis had told him - that
  there was nothing between him and freedom except the killing of Dick
  Walker.</p>

  <p>"All the rest," said Tom, "she thought could be paid for. I took a man's
  horse, but I took that horse because he was going to kill Peter. I paid him
  for that horse afterward. And I've paid for everything else I took. If I
  haven't paid enough, I'll pay more. I want every one of you to see that I'm
  honest. But when she told me that I could be free if I found the real
  murderer of Dick Walker, I started out to find him. It was a hard thing to
  do. Rains had fallen since the killing. But I worked around the place until I
  found a shell for a revolver a mile away in the brush -"</p>

  <p>"A mile away! In brush!" exclaimed someone.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" said the intent sheriff, whose honest eyes were fixed on the
  face of Tom.</p>

  <p>"I came on the line from that shell to Walker's grave. I found soot on a
  stone on top of the next mountain and thought that the killer must have made
  his camp fire there. Then I went on. Jerry - that's the bear, you see -
  helped me find the trail. He's very good at that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>There was a murmur of interest and wonder from the others.</p>

  <p>"Finally, I came to this house. I found Bill McKenzie and started talking
  to him. While we were talking, he admitted that he had killed Walker. He told
  me that, I think, because he understood that I was trying to escape from your
  posse. But afterward he became suspicious again. When my back was turned, he
  tried to break my head with the butt of his revolver. I dodged that. His dog
  caught me by the leg."</p>

  <p>He turned with a limp and pointed to the crimson-stained rent in the back
  of his buckskin trousers.</p>

  <p>"I knocked down the dog with a stick of wood, and then I fought McKenzie.
  He nearly choked me to death. You see?" He pointed to the torn throat. "But I
  broke away. Finally, I knocked him down. He could not get up. Then I tied him
  and heated the poker and made him write that confession. All of this is the
  truth!"</p>

  <p>He paused, and a silence of deep wonder fell on the crowd until Hank
  Jeffries snarled.</p>

  <p>"Sheriff," he said, "does it sound reasonable and nacheral that a gent the
  size of Parks could beat Bill McKenzie? Look at the two of 'em side by
  side!"</p>

  <p>And truly it was a comparison which dwarfed Tom.</p>

  <p>"There is a way of proving what has happened," said Tom. "Free our hands
  and let Bill McKenzie fight me again - here where the walls of the room don't
  hem us in - where I have room enough to move around. Will you do that,
  Sheriff?"</p>

  <p>He was on fire at the thought. The old joy of battle which had thrilled
  him in the conflict with Bill McKenzie returned.</p>

  <p>"I'll do that," said the sheriff slowly. "I'll do that, and if you can
  beat him fair and square, it sure will look like you been telling the truth.
  And if you been telling the truth in one part, the whole yarn will sound
  pretty much like the real thing. We know that Walker and McKenzie used to be
  enemies. We know he ain't the first gent that McKenzie has finished."</p>

  <p>Here he turned point-blank upon Bill.</p>

  <p>"McKenzie," he said, "talk out. Here you got a chance to prove that he's a
  liar. What do you say? Shall we turn the two of you loose and the rest of us
  stand off and give you room and let you fight it out - unless you try to bolt
  for it?"</p>

  <p>Bill McKenzie stared fixedly at Tom, and he saw the whole body of the
  smaller man quivering with eagerness. A smaller man, to be sure, but one
  strong enough to have broken a common man to bits. His eye dwelt on the
  perfect proportions, the thick shoulders, the long and sinewy arms. And the
  conviction came to him that, fighting in the free open, he would be simply
  cut to pieces as a wolf cuts a dog.</p>

  <p>His head drooped.</p>

  <p>"I'll see you dead first," he said. "I ain't going to fight to give you
  the fun of watching. Damn the whole lot of you!"</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch35"
     name="ch35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

  <p class="first">A premonition of disaster came to John Hampton Themis when
he heard the
  uproar pouring through the street of Turnbull. Why his heart should have
  fallen so suddenly, he could not tell. But his first thought was one of
  relief that Gloria was out of town visiting the daughter of a rancher who had
  taken her to the ranch that morning.</p>

  <p>He put on his hat and ran out to the front of the house in time to see the
  procession pass through the light of the late evening. A murmur had run
  before it, apparently, and informed the town of Turnbull that something worth
  seeing was about to enter the street, for the entire population had assembled
  on front porches and in the street itself.</p>

  <p>And what they saw, and what Themis saw, was, first of all, a stream of
  lean- ribbed dogs running in tumult. Behind them came half a dozen of the
  cowpunchers who had ridden out with the sheriff days before on the trail of
  Tom Parks. Behind them came the sheriff himself, and at the side of the
  sheriff was a big man with long hair, dressed in buckskin trousers and a
  tattered buckskin shirt. He sat the saddle on a magnificent stallion which
  danced along to the noise of the shouts of the men of Turnbull.</p>

  <p>It was Tom Parks. Themis could not fail to recognize at any distance the
  face of the man who had surprised and attacked him on the bank of the river.
  It was Tom Parks. But how did it happen that he was returning in the guise,
  almost, of a conqueror? His hands were free, and he was sitting the saddle on
  the famous horse he had stolen from Hank Jeffries. There was even a rifle in
  its case slung under one of his knees, and a revolver was at his hip.
  Certainly this was not the manner in which a man-killer was brought back to
  town!</p>

  <p>There was another man who better filled the role of a prisoner. This was a
  huge fellow who tame behind Parks with his hands imprisoned in steel cuffs
  before him. He rode on a broad-hipped, powerful chunk of a horse, and all
  around him were clustered the rest of the posse. His name was flashed up to
  Themis by a dozen voices: "Bill McKenzie! It's Bill McKenzie!"</p>

  <p>But who Bill McKenzie might be remained a mystery to Themis. He waited
  until the procession had filed past, and then, filled with gloomy
  apprehension, he trailed in the rear toward the jail, where the procession
  ended.</p>

  <p>Parks and the sheriff and Bill McKenzie and some of the posse had gone
  inside. But a score of men remained in the street. Around each a cluster of
  the townsfolk formed and heard the recital of the adventure. Themis joined
  one of these groups and heard the tale.</p>

  <p>It was vigorously told. Nothing was left out of the long and arduous trail
  which the posse had followed, and how they had been led astray time and again
  by the deft maneuvers of Tom Parks. Yet they had clung indefatigably to the
  work, though half a dozen of their number had fallen behind on lamed or
  exhausted horses. The rest of the party had pushed ahead, hopeless, to be
  sure, but determined to do their best against this invincible phantom of the
  mountains.</p>

  <p>And so, at the last, they had ridden into the clearing and seen the half-
  naked giant standing beside the wall of the cabin. That scene of the capture
  was painted with vivid, rough words, and then came the expose' of Bill
  McKenzie as the real murderer of Dick Walker.</p>

  <p>"But when we started on back," said the narrator to his breathless
  audience, "we kept an eye on Tom Parks all the time. The sheriff wasn't
  taking no chances, and you couldn't blame him. He had half a dozen of us do
  nothing but keep around Tom all the time. But before we'd been with him long
  we began to see what sort of a gent he was."</p>

  <p>"And I'll tell you, boys, that we sort of expected to find him a
  man-eater. What he turned out to be was white all the way through. No
  growling or snarling. He talked man and he acted man all the way. Never put
  up no complaints about the irons. Never done no sulking with his head down.
  He kept his chin up and looked us in the eye. That's the sort of a gent he
  is. When a gent spoke to him, he spoke right up and answered back plumb
  cheerful. He didn't make no secrets out of nothing. Inside of a couple of
  hours we got out the whole story."</p>

  <p>"Seems that when he was twelve years old he come across the mountains in a
  storm with his father and a burro. He got played out walking in the snow and
  the wind. His father picked him up and carried him down below timber line,
  and doing that he run himself to death, got pneumonia, and that night,
  getting delirious, he walked over the edge of the river and was drowned. That
  kid was left there. He tried to move on down the river, but a lion killed the
  burro. Then he had to stay there. And he stayed there till he growed up. Only
  man he seen was a brother of McKenzie that come along and beat the kid up and
  killed a couple of bears that he found and tamed. And Tom shot McKenzie and
  saved the last of the cubs. And that cub is the bear that's been trailing him
  around ever since. But it sure threw a scare into Parks. He begun to figure
  that there weren't any good men in the world except that father of his that
  had died. He figured it was better to live by himself, and he done it. That's
  the short of his story. But wait till you get a chance to hear him tell
  it!"</p>

  <p>"The sheriff believes every word, and he says that no white man in the
  valley will prosecute a case against Parks for stealing what he always paid
  for, anyway. I'll tell you one thing - no friend of mine is going to
  prosecute any such case! This Parks is clean all the way through. I don't ask
  no better man's hand to shake and call friend."</p>

  <p>And such was the explosion of the tale of the "wild man of Turnbull
  Valley." The Indian had turned into a white man. The reckless marauder had
  been revealed as a man who knew nothing of property rights.</p>

  <p>"He even got Peter back," said the narrator. "He took Hank Jeffries and
  the rest of us to the place where he'd left Peter. He'd covered their trail
  complete. Why, it would of made you open your eyes and blink to see the way
  that hoss acted. The rest of us scared him stiff. He run for Tom and crowded
  up agin' him like he was asking Tom for help."</p>

  <p>"We all looked to Hank Jeffries to see what he'd do. Hank seen it was up
  to him to act sort of generous. He told Tom that he'd try to ride Peter, and
  if he couldn't manage it, he'd give the hoss to Tom free and easy. And that's
  what he done. He climbed into the saddle on old Peter, and he started to ride
  him. Didn't look like there was going to be nothing to it. Peter was scared,
  right enough, but he answered the bridle like he was thinking the same
  thoughts with his rider. Tom begun to look sick. But pretty soon Hank made a
  wrong step. He got so plumb confident that the hoss was broke for him that he
  touched Peter up with the spurs!"</p>

  <p>"It was sure a fool move. Peter seemed to take that as orders for doing a
  cakewalk up the sky and kicking out a star or two. He raised Cain in seven
  languages, and inside of thirty seconds he pitched Hank on his head and come
  running over to Tom like a dog and shoved his head down against Tom's
  chest."</p>

  <p>"Well, Hank got up staggering and raging. He wanted that hoss quick, so's
  he could blow its fool head off, because he said it was a nacheral born man-
  killer. But there stood the hoss asking Tom for help, you might say. And
  there was Tom talking to Peter like Peter was a man. It was sure something to
  remember, that picture. Then the sheriff he ups and tells Hank that his hand
  has all been played out, and that he ain't got a trick left for taking Peter.
  He'd give Peter to Tom by not being able to ride him, and the whole gang of
  us was there as witnesses to the bargain."</p>

  <p>"There wasn't nothing for Hank to do but buckle under, no matter how he
  hated it, so Tom rode back right on his own hoss, and it was sure a circus to
  watch them two together. About the end of the second day the sheriff talked
  things over with us, and then he took a chance. He got hold of Tom and said
  if Tom would give his word not to try to escape, he'd let him ride with his
  hands free and do what he liked. And after Tom agreed, I'll tell a man that
  we sure lived on the fat of the land. If we wanted fish, he'd sneak off and
  drop a hook into a pond, and it looked like the fish come running to get
  caught. If we hankered after venison, Tom would snoop off through the hills
  and come back in no time with a deer. It wasn't no starvation party that we
  rode on, I'll tell a man!"</p>

  <p>There was more talk like this, but John Hampton Themis had heard enough to
  confirm his suspicion. When Gloria came back to the town, she would find the
  praises of the wild man on the lips of everyone. Not only would he no longer
  be dreaded, but every pretty girl in the town would have a wildly beating
  heart at the mere thought of meeting this handsome giant whom even the men
  were praising. And in that romantic atmosphere, how could Gloria be expected
  to keep her head about her?</p>

  <p>Themis went on into the jail and found it all buzzing with excitement. The
  happy sheriff came up to shake hands with him.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Themis," he said, "if the luck had been with you, your party
  might have done just what mine did. I give you credit for stirring up the
  valley for the hunt, at any rate. We profited by the lessons which you had
  taught us. And when you come right down to it, he never could have been
  caught if he hadn't wanted us to take him!"</p>

  <p>Themis brushed the praise away.</p>

  <p>"He gets off scot-free, then?" he said.</p>

  <p>The sheriff shook his head with a frown.</p>

  <p>"I thought he would," he said. "But that fellow whose dogs were killed by
  Parks insists on getting damages. He's worked up a bill for a thousand
  dollars, nearly. Everybody else has agreed to withdraw their charges. But
  that gent won't budge. If it wasn't for him, Tom could walk free out of the
  jail. But where can a boy like him find a thousand dollars?"</p>

  <p>The mind of Themis was never slow. Now it worked like lightning, reaching
  far ahead to the future.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I sit down and write a check - I have my checkbook with me - do
  you think that would set Tom free?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," said the sheriff. "We know you, Mr. Themis. Your check is the
  same as gold. But would you do a fine thing like that?"</p>

  <p>It was done in half a minute. The check was scrawled, torn from the book,
  and placed in the astonished sheriff's hands.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Themis, "can you so arrange it that I may talk with Parks?
  Talk with him alone, I mean?"</p><hr><br>

  <h2><a  id="ch36"
     name="ch36"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

  <p class="first">It was no easy thing to manage, but eventually the crowd
was cleared from
  the sheriff's office, and Tom was brought in. He stood tall and silent in one
  corner, his quiet, keen eyes fixed upon the face of the millionaire.</p>

  <p>"Tom," said the sheriff, laying his hand affectionately on the shoulder of
  his prisoner. "I'm mighty glad to tell you that we've brought you into town
  just to turn you loose and set you free again. I was afraid for a while that
  it wouldn't come out just that way. But Mr. Themis, here - I guess you've met
  before," - here the sheriff grinned, but Tom's face retained its gravity -
  "Mr. Themis, as I was saying, has made out a check for a thousand dollars to
  pay off the only gent that's going to press a charge against you. Well, Tom,
  I guess you don't know much about what money means. But after you've worked
  for some of it you will. And you'll see that a thousand iron men come slow
  when a gent tries to save 'em. It's a pretty fine thing that Mr. Themis has
  done. I'm going to leave you in here to talk with him because he wants you
  to. Afterward, you can walk out of this jail just when you please. If you got
  no better place to go tonight, I got a bed in my house that ain't working,
  and I'd sure be honored if you come and put up with us. My wife would make
  you plumb to home!"</p>

  <p>It was quite a speech for the sheriff. Moreover, it was a speech which
  obviously came from the heart. And Themis watched with a keen curiosity to
  see what Tom would say.</p>

  <p>"You are a kind man," he said to the sheriff, "but tonight Jerry is
  wandering back in the hills. He is waiting for me. Peter and I must go to
  find him. But when I come to Turnbull again, I shall come to you first - to
  thank you again."</p>

  <p>It was neatly turned, Themis felt. The sheriff flushed with pleasure and
  goodwill and went whistling through the door. As soon as it was closed behind
  him, the man of the mountains faced Themis again. And the latter noted that
  no word of thanks had passed his lips.</p>

  <p>The explanation came at once.</p>

  <p>"You have paid me a thousand dollars," said Tom Parks. "What am I to pay
  you, Mr. Themis?"</p>

  <p>The latter started. He had not expected this quiet thrust. Plainly, the
  big man was nobody's fool. And Themis flushed a little.</p>

  <p>"You are exactly right," he said. "Parks, I shall expect a return."</p>

  <p>"I shall make it if I can," said Tom. "What is it that you wish?"</p>

  <p>"To keep you from my daughter," said Themis, with a sudden feeling that he
  must be nothing but utterly honest while he faced those shrewd, sharp eyes,
  so trained to the following of obscure trails on the mountain, and equally
  keen, perhaps, to look into the minds of men. "What I wish, Tom, is to keep
  you from my daughter."</p>

  <p>Tom Parks paused, and Themis saw that the big fellow was carefully
  restraining himself and waiting until his emotion should pass over.</p>

  <p>Then he said as quietly as ever: "If you were to offer me money for Peter,
  I should laugh at you. If you were to offer me money for Jerry, I should
  laugh again. But when you offer me money to keep away from Gloria, to sit
  where she is sitting, to watch her, to see her and know that she is beautiful
  - if you offer me money in place of that, I cannot even laugh, Mr.
  Themis."</p>

  <p>"Tom Parks," said the rich man, more and more amazed by the talk of the
  big man, "where did you gain an education? What books have you read?"</p>

  <p>"Only two," said Tom Parks.</p>

  <p>"And what are they?"</p>

  <p>"The Bible and the Morte dArthur."</p>

  <p>"That's enough," said the other. "I can't tell you what a difference it
  makes to me to learn that you know those two books. But I shall go on
  developing my idea to you. You see that I am at least frank, Tom?"</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"Before you can understand me fully, or I you, we must come to an
  agreement. We agree, in short, that what we are both interested in is the
  greatest happiness for Gloria?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then let us slip out the rear of the jail where the crowd can't see us
  and follow you. I want to take you to the house where we are staying."</p>

  <p>It was done. They went through the rear of the jail. Behind the houses
  they circled back through the dark of the night and entered the house which
  Themis had rented. There they went directly to the room of Gloria. And in
  that room Themis opened a closet door. The shadowy recess was filled with the
  glimmer of silks.</p>

  <p>"If you stay in this part of the country," said Themis, "do you know what
  you will make each month as a cowpuncher - I mean, what you will make in
  money?"</p>

  <p>Tom Parks shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Forty dollars," said Themis. "And if you save it all, it makes six
  hundred dollars a year. Now look at these clothes. There's hardly a dress
  here that cost less than fifty. Most of them cost more. And yet this is the
  simplest part of Gloria's wardrobe. She brought this along to rough it in the
  mountains, as she expressed it. And here are the shoes, Tom. You see this
  whole rack of 'em?"</p>

  <p>Tom Parks took out a dainty slipper. It was lost in the brown expanse of
  his palm, and he wondered with a faint exclamation at the delicate
  workmanship.</p>

  <p>"And after all," Themis continued, as he opened a great wardrobe trunk
  filled with other articles of wearing apparel, "this, as I said before, is
  only a small section of Gloria's clothes. And I wish you to remember, Tom,
  that a woman's husband is expected to provide for her. Can you give her these
  things?"</p>

  <p>Tom had grown pale.</p>

  <p>Then he answered slowly: "When a man's stomach is full," he said, "and
  there is no work to do, the mountains are most beautiful. But even when his
  belly is flat and he is following a long trail, they are still
  beautiful."</p>

  <p>Themis wrinkled his brows - then nodded.</p>

  <p>"I understand you," he said. "She has been happy in one way when she had
  all these things. She will be happy in quite another way if she marries you.
  I shall admit even more. Gloria is not a girl who needs the finest silks. She
  could get on with much less. But there is a minimum of that to which a woman
  is accustomed, which she must have in order for her happiness to be possible.
  And even that minimum, I'm afraid, you cannot give her. Mind you, Tom, I am
  showing you these clothes simply to indicate other things. Clothes are a
  small part of a modern woman's environment. But every other thing that costs
  money is dear to Gloria. She has never had to consider cost. She has formed a
  thousand tastes. Consider only music and the theater. They are not small
  things in her eyes. And there are her friends, Tom, just as dear to her as
  your Peter and Jerry are to you. If she came out here with you, she would
  lose all this. And remember, again, that we are both considering one thing
  first before all else - what will make for the greatest happiness of
  Gloria!"</p>

  <p>The head of Tom lowered. He passed a hand across his forehead. And Themis
  saw that his face was corrugated with misery.</p>

  <p>"And now," he went on smoothly, "suppose we pass to my proposal in full.
  You see that I oppose you now. I wish to keep you from Gloria. She is an
  emotional girl, full of enthusiasm, easily swept off her feet. If you come
  near her now, it will be like bringing fire near dried stubble. You see that
  I am telling you even more than you knew about her. I oppose you now because
  I cannot tell what you will be after you've mixed with the men and tried to
  make a place for yourself. Mind you, I don't demand that you make a fortune.
  All I ask is that you become capable of making a moderately good living. That
  will be enough. In fact, I have no right to make any demands. It is only
  because I see that you are fair minded that I advance any proposals for the
  welfare of Gloria."</p>

  <p>"Go on," said Tom in a husky voice. "Finish what you have to say."</p>

  <p>"Very well. My suggestion is that you go into the East just as Gloria has
  come into the West. If you will do that, I shall be willing to furnish you
  with a letter of introduction to a friend of mine who will make a place for
  you in his business. In return, I ask that for a solid year you do not speak
  to Gloria or in any way attempt to communicate with her. I send you to the
  East. I furnish you with enough money to live decently and pay your railroad
  fare. You, in return, do your best to fit yourself to make a living. At the
  end of a year, perhaps Gloria will have changed. Perhaps not. Perhaps you
  will have found a place for yourself. Perhaps not. At any rate, we would both
  be taking a chance. Does that sound fair to you?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Tom, with the sweat pouring out on his forehead, "she
  would have forgotten me!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Themis honestly, "she would."</p>

  <p>Tom walked across the room, came back to the window, and stared into the
  black night.</p>

  <p>"To leave Peter and Jerry -" he said.</p>

  <p>"If she stayed here," said Themis, "how much more would she be giving
  up!"</p>

  <p>And his heart beat high with hope. There was sympathy, too, in the glance
  with which he watched the young fellow struggle with his conscience, for he
  saw that he was dealing with an honest man and a brave man, who did not
  flinch from the infliction of pain on himself. And Themis himself was honest
  as the day is long.</p>

  <p>He did not press his point, but waited.</p>

  <p>"And you," said Tom suddenly, facing Themis, "are her father. You have a
  right to her."</p>

  <p>"Only to work for her happiness, Tom, my boy, just as you would do if you
  could."</p>

  <p>"To leave them both," said Tom slowly. "It is very hard!"</p>

  <p>"I can manage another thing for you," said Themis, full of sympathy. "I
  can ship the horse East for you. As for Jerry, you will bid him good-bye for
  a year."</p>

  <p>"But you will send me the horse?" said Tom sadly.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then - I accept."</p>

  <p>Themis drew a great breath and collapsed in a chair. He did not know
  before how great had been the strain under which he labored. He had gained a
  year! And a year in the life of a girl is an eternity! He would sweep her off
  to Europe. He would give her a whirl through Paris. He would surround her
  with fine young fellows of her own age, her own position. And if the year did
  not bring about results; he could say that he did not know human nature.</p>

  <p>"Take my hand," he said, and offered it.</p>

  <p>That hand was almost crushed by a tremendous pressure.</p>

  <p>"We shall neither of us forget," said Themis. "Go back to Jerry and tell
  him good-bye. Then come to me tomorrow. No, better still, I shall meet you -
  behind the Jeffries place, let us say."</p>

  <p>"I shall be there at noon," said Tom. And he turned to the door.</p>

  <p>He did not go on, however. A door banged. Light steps came running down
  the hall. Tom turned to Themis with a face of agony.</p>

  <p>"It is her step!" he said.</p>

  <p>"You have given me your word," said Themis anxiously. He rose from the
  chair. "Not a syllable to her, Tom, or the compact is broken!"</p>

  <p>The door of the room was dashed open. Gloria stood before them, flushed,
  radiant, worthy of her name.</p>

  <p>"Dad - Tom - oh," she cried, "I've heard! It can't be true! It's too
  wonderfully good to be true! And both of you here -"</p>

  <p>She fell suddenly silent, staring into the stony face of Tom Parks. She
  recoiled as he walked past her without a word, passed through the door,
  closed it behind him, and disappeared with a soundless step.</p>

  <p>Then she turned on Themis.</p>

  <p>"Dad!" she whispered. "What has happened?"</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said, "are you going to ask me to explain the psychology of
  a wild man?"</p>

  <p>She looked helplessly, despairingly at him.</p>

  <p>"I'll follow!" she cried. "I'll find out!"</p>

  <p>She ran to the door, paused, turned away.</p>

  <p>"Not a step," she said. "I'll not follow him a step!"</p>

  <p>But she dropped into a chair and sat with clasped hands,, watching the
  face of Themis for an explanation.</p>

  <p>But Themis was looking past her and into the future. He was wondering,
  after all, if he had been right. He carried at least one certainty: Tom Parks
  was a fighter. He had battled all his life. And the winning of Gloria might
  prove only one battle more which he would win, though perhaps the greatest
  battle of all.</p>

  <p>He looked sadly at the girl's face. Great tears were running slowly down
  her cheeks. And Themis resigned himself to destiny.</p>
