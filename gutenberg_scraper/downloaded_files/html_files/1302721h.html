<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<hr class="2">
<p>It was the lifelong wish of Mr. George Fife Angas, one of the
Fathers and Founders of South Australia, that a History of the
Colony of his adoption, and which he was mainly instrumental in
establishing, should be written. To this end he collected a vast
number of documents from all available sources, and for many
years employed a secretary to set them in order, hoping some day
to write the History himself. But that day never came, and in
1879 Mr. Angas passed away. Among his papers several were found
that showed how intensely keen his desire was that a full and
comprehensive History, giving the story of the rise and progress
of the colony, should be written. His son, the Hon. J.H. Angas,
Member of the Legislative Council of South Australia, determined
that the wish should be fulfilled, and kindly placed in my hands
the whole of the valuable and voluminous papers. Of this material
I have availed myself freely, and I have also drawn from Memoirs,
Diaries, Travels, Parliamentary Debates, as well as from the
Colonial Newspapers.</p>
<p>For the sake of easy reference, I have divided the work into
chapters dealing with the successive Administrations of the
various Governors, and have given fuller detail in the earlier
than in the later chapters.</p>
<p>A special feature is the "Chronological Summary of Events",
divided in like manner under the Administration of each Governor;
and it is suggested that, after reading a chapter of the History,
the corresponding portion of the Summary may be glanced through
with advantage. It has been impossible to verify every date, the
source from which a fact has been gleaned having perhaps
contained only vague phrases, such as "recently" or "a short time
since", in which case an approximate date has been given. Neither
has it been possible to include <em>every</em> event of interest,
and therefore those only have been chosen which appeared to me
best worth recording, as marking progressive stages in the
development of the colony. The Summary cannot fail to prove of
interest to colonists, as it will keep alive the memory of events
in which many of them were personally concerned, while the
Obituary notices will recall the names and deeds of men and women
who, like themselves, have been the "Makers" of the Colony.</p>
<p>I have to express my very hearty thanks to the Hon. J.H. Angas
for his untiring assistance during the whole period covered in
the preparation of this work. I also gladly acknowledge my
indebtedness to the columns of the <i>South Australian
Register</i>, to the valuable library of the Royal Colonial
Institute, and to the kindness and courtesy of Mr. J.S.
O'Halloran, the Secretary to the Institute.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> first authenticated discovery of Australia
by a European is believed to have been made by Manoel Godinho de
Eredia, a Portuguese, in 1601. Five years later, Louis de Torres,
a Spaniard, passed through the Straits that still bear his name.
In 1609 De Quiros, also a Spaniard, saw the land and is said to
have called it Australia. Then followed several Dutch exploratory
expeditions, and in 1664 the island-continent was named New
Holland by the Dutch Government. Dampier, in 1686, is supposed to
have been the first Englishman who visited Terra Australis, as it
was also called. In 1770 Captain Cook carefully explored the east
coast, gave names to several localities, and took possession of
the country for Great Britain.</p>
<p>Before the commencement of the present century, Bligh,
Edwards, Portlock, Bampton, Alt, Vancouver, Furneaux, and others
had visited various parts of the coast, but there were still 250
leagues of the Southern and Western seaboard marked on the maps
as the "Unknown Coast". The honour of tilling up this blank in
the chart of the Great South Land is due to Matthew Flinders.</p>
<p>In August, 1794, Captain John Hunter set sail in the
<i>Reliance</i> for the then newly formed penal settlement at
Port Jackson, to succeed the first Governor, Captain Phillip.
There were on board the vessel two daring young men panting for
adventurous exploration&mdash;George Bass, surgeon, and Matthew
Flinders, midshipman. Soon after arrival at Sydney some scope was
given to their ambition; they launched a little boat, eight feet
long, named the <i>Tom Thumb</i>, and with no other crew than a
small boy they sailed across Botany Bay and ascended twenty miles
further up George's River than had been previously reached. At
another time in the same boat they explored the Illawarra coast.
After sundry trips, taken together or separately, during one of
which Mr. Bass had observed a supposed inlet between Van Diemen's
Land and the mainland, the Governor gave his consent to the
proper fitting out of a boat expedition for further explorations;
and Flinders and Bass set sail in the <i>Norfolk</i>, a
deck-built boat of twenty-five tons, with a crew of eight men. As
a result of this voyage. Van Diemen's Land was proved to be an
island separated from the mainland by a strait ever since known
as Bass's Strait.</p>
<p>In 1800 Flinders returned to England in the <i>Reliance</i>,
and so successfully urged upon the Government the importance of
prosecuting the survey of the Unknown Coast, that an expedition
was at once fitted out, a war-vessel, the <i>Xenophon</i>,
renamed the <i>Investigator</i> on account of the service in
which she was to be employed, being set apart for the purpose,
and Flinders was promoted to the rank of Commander. Every care
was taken in the outfit, and besides the provision made by
Government, the Honourable East India Company gave the sum of
&pound;600 for any additional necessities. The crew was composed
of picked men; amongst the midshipmen was Mr. (afterwards Sir)
John Franklin, the great Arctic navigator, and attached to the
scientific staff was Robert Brown, the able botanist, and William
Westall, a celebrated landscape painter.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Westall's original sketches are now in the
library of the Royal Colonial Institute, London.]</p>
<p>Owing to the war between France and England then in progress,
a passport was obtained from the French Government ensuring the
expedition from molestation by any of the armed ships of the
enemy.</p>
<p>The <i>Investigator</i> arrived off Cape Leeuwin (or Lioness,
so named after a Dutch vessel that had made the headland in 1622)
on the 6th of December, 1801, and after proceeding to King
George's Sound to refit, Captain Flinders set forth on his voyage
of discovery. The map of South Australia still marks the course
of his route. Fowler's Bay was named after his first lieutenant;
Streaky Bay on account of the colour of the water; Smoky Bay from
the smoke of bush fires; Denial Bay because of its proximity to
St. Peter's Island; <i>Investigator</i>'s Group, one of which was
called Flinders' Island, after the second lieutenant (the
captain's brother), and Coffin Bay named after Vice-Admiral Sir
Isaac Coffin.</p>
<p>On the 20th of February, 1802, Flinders arrived at an inlet
since known as Sleaford Bay. He was a Lincolnshire man, and this
was one of a series of places he named after spots in his
well-loved native county. At Sleaford Bay he found that the coast
took a sudden turn, trending to the north, but that no land was
visible to the north-east, from which quarter a strong tide was
setting in. This gave rise to many wild conjectures. "Large
rivers, deep inlets, inland seas, and passages into the Gulf of
Carpentaria," says Flinders, "were terms frequently used in our
conversations of this evening, and the prospect of making an
interesting discovery inspired new life into every man in the
ship." Next morning Flinders went on shore, accompanied by Mr.
Thistle, the mate, and satisfied himself of the insularity of the
land. Soon after this a cutter was sent on shore in charge of Mr.
Thistle with a midshipman named Taylor and others, to search for
an anchorage and water. It was a fatal voyage. For a long time
the little boat had been watched sailing hither and thither in
her search, and towards dusk she was seen returning from the
land. Then suddenly she was lost to sight, and Lieutenant Fowler
went in a boat with a lantern to ascertain the cause. Two hours
passed without any tidings. A gun was then fired, and Lieutenant
Fowler returned soon afterwards, but alone. Near the situation
where the cutter had been last seen he met with so strong a
rippling of tide that he himself narrowly escaped being capsized,
and there was reason to fear that this was what had actually
happened to Mr. Thistle and his companions. Had there been
daylight, some or all of the crew might have been saved, although
only two out of the eight were good swimmers. But the tide was
running strong, the night was pitchy dark, and hope was
abandoned.</p>
<p>Next morning the missing cutter was found bottom upwards, and
although most careful and diligent search was made in every
direction, not a trace was ever discovered of any of the crew.
The sight of a large number of sharks in the immediate
neighbourhood furnished a horrible suggestion of their fate.</p>
<p>Flinders called the island on which he had landed Thistle
Island, and caused an inscription to be engraved on a sheet of
copper, and set up on a post at the head of the little inlet,
which in commemoration of the sad event he named Memory Cove; the
adjacent headland he called Cape Catastrophe, and the surrounding
islands Grindal, Hopkins, Williams, Taylor, after men lost in the
cutter. When all attempts to find any survivor of the missing
boat's crew had proved ineffectual, Flinders entered a
magnificent harbour, Port Lincoln, where he determined to refit
and take in water. Almost every place in this neighbourhood he
named after localities familiar to him in Lincolnshire. Thus the
bay, an island, and a point of land bore the name Boston; Cape
Donnington commemorated his native village; Louth Bay, Spalding
Cove, Kirton Point, Stamford Hill, Reevesby, Sibsey, Grantham and
Spilsby Islands, Sleaford Bay and Mere&mdash;all memorialize more
or less the county of the fens.</p>
<p>On the 6th of March he left Port Lincoln and proceeded
northwards. A cluster of islands was named after Sir Joseph
Banks, whose good offices with the Admiralty had procured the
equipment of the expedition; Barn Hill, Mount Young, Middle
Mount, Point Lowly, Mount Brown, Mount Arden, and other places
further marked the course of his explorations, while the whole
range, of which these mountains formed a part, was honoured with
the name of Flinders himself.</p>
<p>The great gulf he was exploring pursued a northerly direction,
and Flinders entertained a strong hope that a channel would be
found by which he could reach the Gulf of Carpentaria. Soon,
however, the land began to lose its bold appearance, and
eventually the gulf was found to terminate in desolate mud flats.
On the return of the <i>Investigator</i> on the east side of the
gulf two capes were named Points Riley and Pearce, after two
gentlemen in the Admiralty, and on the 19th of February he
entered a bay and named it after the Earl of Hardwicke. On the
following day he was again at the head of the gulf named
Spencer's Gulf, after Earl Spencer who was First Lord of the
Admiralty at the time the expedition of the <i>Investigator</i>
was determined upon. The eastern point of land he called Cape
Spencer, and three islands near, the Althorpes.</p>
<p>Land was now seen from south to south-west, but whether it was
an island or part of the continent was as uncertain as whether
the wide opening seen at the same time was an inlet or a strait.
Overtaken in a storm, Flinders stood across to the land, and,
after rounding the headland (named Point Marsden, after the
Second Secretary of the Admiralty), a bay was found beyond
offering good shelter, and here they anchored, naming it Nepean
Bay, after Sir E. Nepean, First Secretary of the Admiralty.</p>
<p>On the 22nd Flinders went ashore, and found a number of
dark-brown kangaroos feeding beside a wood. "It would be
difficult to guess how many kangaroos were seen," he wrote, "but
I killed ten; the rest of the party made up the number to
thirty-one taken on board in the course of the day, the least of
them weighing 69 and the largest 125 pounds. . . . I scrambled
with difficulty through the brushwood and over fallen trees to
reach the higher land with the surveying instruments, but the
thickness and height of the wood prevented anything else from
being distinguished. There was little doubt, however, that this
extensive piece of land was separated from the continent, for the
extraordinary tameness of the kangaroos, and the presence of
seals upon the shore, concurred with the absence of all traces of
men to show that it was not inhabited. . . . The whole ship's
company," he adds, "was employed this afternoon in skinning and
cleaning the kangaroos, and a delightful regale they afforded
after four months' privation from almost any fresh provisions.
Half a hundredweight of heads, forequarters, and tails were
stewed down into soup for dinner on this and the succeeding days,
and as much steaks given, moreover, to both officers and men as
they could consume by day and by night. In gratitude for so
seasonable a supply I named the southern land Kangaroo Island."
And here, as we shall presently see, the first settlers in South
Australia landed in 1836.</p>
<p>While off Kangaroo island the captain named the nearest
headland Cape Jervis, and the highest land seen to the north-east
Mount Lofty. Leaving Kangaroo Island, he stood across for Cape
Spencer, naming the straits between, <i>Investigator</i>'s
Straits, and on the 29th of February found himself in another
gulf with land right ahead as well as on both sides. A rise at
the head of the gulf he named Hummock Mount, and in honour of the
admiral who presided at the Board of Admiralty when he left
England, he called his new discovery the Gulf of St. Vincent; the
peninsula separating the two gulfs he designated Yorke's
Peninsula, after the Right Honourable Charles Philip Yorke, and a
dangerous shoal at the entrance of Gulf St. Vincent, Troubridge
Shoal.</p>
<p>Flinders pronounced the country round the Gulf of St. Vincent
to be generally superior to that on the borders of Spencer's
Gulf, but the only notice he gives of its eastern side, destined
to become a few years afterwards an important British settlement,
was as follows: "The nearest part of the coast was distant three
leagues, mostly low, and composed of sand and rock, with a few
small trees scattered over it; but a few miles inland, where the
back mountains rise, the country was well clothed with forest
timber, and had a fertile appearance."</p>
<p>The <i>Investigator</i> touched once more at Kangaroo Island,
"where not less than thirty emus were seen on shore at one time,"
and then proceeded through what Flinders called Backstairs
Passage and anchored in Antechamber Bay. The headland at its
eastern end, where now a fine lighthouse stands, he named Cape
Willoughby. Leaving here, he passed three small islands, The
Pages, and soon after a report from aloft announced a white rock
ahead. "On approaching nearer," says Flinders, "it proved to be a
ship standing towards us, and we cleared for action in case of
being attacked. The stranger was a heavy-looking ship without any
topgallant masts up, and, on colours being hoisted, she showed a
French ensign, and afterwards an English jack forward, as we did
a white flag. At half-past five, the land being then five miles
distant to the north-east, I hove-to, and learned, as the
stranger passed to leeward with a fair wind, that it was the
French national ship <i>Le G&eacute;ographe</i>, under the
command of Captain Nicholas Baudin. We veered round as <em>Le
G&eacute;ographe</em> was passing, so as to keep our broadside to
her, lest the flag of truce should be a deception, and having
come to the wind on the other tack, a boat was hoisted out, and I
went on board the French ship, which had also hove-to." The
passports of both captains were exchanged and read, and Flinders
learned that his fellow-navigator had parted company from his
consort-ship <i>Le Naturaliste</i> in a heavy gale in Bass's
Straits, had lost his geographical engineer with the largest boat
and its crew, and that he had examined part of Van Diemen's Land
and part of the south coast of Australia. The navigators
communicated their discoveries to each other, and Flinders
presented Baudin with some charts. In honour of this friendly
meeting Flinders named the locality Encounter Bay, and in passing
along the southern coast adopted the nomenclature of Baudin,
except in the case of two headlands discovered by Grant in
December, 1800, and named respectively Capes Northumberland and
Bridgewater.</p>
<p>Monsieur Peron, the naturalist to the French expedition,
pursued a very different course with regard to the discoveries of
Flinders, not only laying a claim to them on behalf of his
nation, but renaming nearly all of them. Kangaroo Island he
called L'Isle D&eacute;cres, Spencer's Gulf Golfe Bonaparte, Gulf
St. Vincent Golfe Jos&eacute;phine, and so on.</p>
<p>This attempt to rob Captain Flinders of the honour so justly
due to him was, as we shall see, afterwards exposed and
condemned.</p>
<p>The first lieutenant of <i>Le G&eacute;ographe</i> was far
more honourable than Monsieur Peron; on meeting Flinders some
time after at Port Jackson, he said to the English navigator.
"Captain, if we had not been kept so long picking up shells and
catching butterflies at Van Diemen's Land, you would not have
discovered the South Coast before us."</p>
<p>On the 9th of May, 1802, the <i>Investigator</i> anchored at
Port Jackson, where Flinders was heartily welcomed by the
Governor, to whom he communicated the important discoveries he
had made, and also sent an account of them to England by the
South Sea whaler <i>Speedy</i>.</p>
<p>On the 22nd of July, 1802, he sailed from Port Jackson with
the <i>Investigator</i> and the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, for the
purpose of visiting Torres Straits and the north coast of
Australia.</p>
<p>During this voyage&mdash;with the details of which we shall
not concern ourselves here, although he explored some portions of
the Northern Territory which in 1863 was added to the province of
South Australia&mdash;he circumnavigated Australia and returned
to Port Jackson on the 9th of June, 1803. The <i>Investigator</i>
was now found to be unfit for further service, and as there was
no other vessel in the harbour ready for exploring purposes,
Flinders determined to proceed to England and lay his charts and
journals before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and if
possible obtain another ship.</p>
<p>A series of disasters now befell the heroic explorer. Soon
after leaving Port Jackson in the
<i>Porpoise</i>&mdash;accompanied by the <i>Bridgewater</i> and
the <i>Cato</i>&mdash;he was wrecked on the Barrier Reef, the
<i>Cato</i> sharing a similar fate. The <i>Bridgewater</i>
escaped, and proceeded on her voyage to India. The crews of the
two wrecked vessels contrived to get upon a sandbank, where they
remained while Flinders returned to Sydney, a distance of seven
hundred miles, in one of the ship's boats to procure
assistance.</p>
<p>The Governor placed two small ships at his disposal, and with
them he proceeded to the reef, and rescued all his companions.
One of the two ships was a colonial cutter, the
<i>Cumberland</i>, of twenty-nine tons, and on his return to
Sydney Flinders conceived the idea of proceeding in this frail
craft, only a little larger than a river-boat, to England. On
making his plan known to the Governor, it was, strange to say,
favourably entertained.</p>
<p>Flinders proposed to put into whatever port lay in his route
for supplies of provisions and water, and seemed to entertain no
doubt of a successful issue to his voyage; but in course of time
his little vessel sprung a leak, and he steered to Mauritius for
repairs. But here, being unprovided with any other passport than
the one issued for the <i>Investigator</i>, he and his crew were
taken prisoners. By an unlucky chance, <i>Le
G&eacute;ographe</i>, with the members of the French expedition
who could have established his identity, had sailed from
Mauritius on the day before his arrival. Having come from
Australia, he was asked if he had seen or heard of "Flindera" the
navigator, and the Governor of the island refused to believe his
reply that he was the man, or that any Australian Governor would
have sanctioned a voyage to England in such a small and dangerous
craft.</p>
<p>Flinders, therefore, was detained a prisoner, and his papers
were taken from him. For six weary years he suffered
incarceration, and was only set at liberty when, in 1810, the
island was capitulated to the English.</p>
<p>"While Flinders was a prisoner at Mauritius, Monsieur Peron,
the naturalist of Baudin's expedition, issued one volume of
voyages and discoveries in Australia, in which he made the
audacious attempt to deprive Flinders of the honour of his
discoveries by giving French names to most of the places the
English navigator had already visited and named.</p>
<p>This ungenerous attempt to appropriate the result of the
labours of another was unsuccessful. The account of his
discoveries which, owing to his incarceration. Flinders was
unable to publish until 1814, completely set at rest for ever the
justness of his claims, and there is a fine ring in the generous
words of the heroic sailor when, in his published work, "Account
of a Voyage to Terra Australis", he says, "How, then, came
Monsieur Peron to advance what was so contrary to truth? Was he a
man destitute of all principle? My answer is, that I believe his
candour to have been equal to his acknowledged abilities, and
that what he wrote was from an overruling authority, and smote
him to the heart, for he did not live to print his second
volume."</p>
<p>Flinders died on the 14th of July, 1814, the very day on which
his book was published. A monument to his memory was erected at
Port Lincoln by Sir John Franklin when he was Governor of
Tasmania.</p>
<p>From the time that Flinders and Baudin visited and explored
parts of the coast-line of South Australia, several years elapsed
before any further important discoveries were made. Captain
Dillon, the discoverer of the remains of La P&eacute;rouse,
visited Port Lincoln and Encounter Bay; Captain Sutherland, in
command of a whaler, visited Kangaroo Island, which became in
process of time partly inhabited by convicts who had escaped from
the neighbouring penal settlements, and by runaway seamen, and
one Captain Jones is said to have discovered the harbour now
known as Port Adelaide.</p>
<p>In 1830, twenty-eight years after Flinders set forth on his
memorable voyages, a vast addition to the knowledge of Australian
geography in general and of South Australia in particular was
made by the discoveries of Captain Charles Sturt.</p>
<p>In September, 1829, the Government of New South Wales, being
anxious to trace the flow of the waters of the Murrumbidgee, or
of such rivers as might be connected with it, instructed Captain
Sturt to make the necessary preparations for a second descent
into the interior for this purpose.</p>
<p>On the 14th of January, 1830, while pursuing the objects of
the expedition down the Murrumbidgee, he came "suddenly and
unexpectedly at the conflux of that river with a noble stream,
flowing," as he says, "from east to west at the rate of two and a
half knots an hour over a clear and sandy bed of a medium width
of from three hundred to four hundred feet."</p>
<p>The river into which the whaleboat and her exploring party had
been launched. Captain Sturt named the Murray after Sir George
Murray, who at that time presided over the Colonial Department.
Pursuing his onward course down the Murray, which Captain Sturt
at first supposed was the Darling&mdash;a river he had previously
discovered and named after General Darling Governor of New South
Wales&mdash;he arrived on the 23rd of January, greatly to his
surprise and satisfaction, at the junction of the Darling with
his new discovery, the Murray.</p>
<p>The Darling at this point was found to be about one hundred
yards wide and twelve feet deep, and in 140&deg; 56" of east
longitude, that is to say, just without the boundary afterwards
fixed for the province of South Australia. In 140&deg; 29" he
found another considerable junction of a river, which he named
the Lindesay, after the colonel of his regiment. A little lower
down he passed another, which he named the Rufus, after the red
hair of his companion, Mr. (afterwards Sir George) MacLeay.</p>
<p>On the 9th of March, finding the horizon getting clearer to
the south, Captain Sturt landed to survey the country. Referring
to this circumstance, he wrote&mdash;</p>
<p>"I still retained a strong impression on my mind that some
change was at hand, and on this occasion I was not disappointed;
but the view was one for which I was not altogether prepared. We
had at length arrived at the termination of the Murray.
Immediately below me was a beautiful lake which appeared to be a
fitting reservoir for the noble stream that had led us to it, and
which was now ruffled by the breeze that swept over it. The
ranges were more distinctly visible, stretching from south to
north, and were certainly distant forty miles. They had a
regular, unbroken outline, declining gradually to the south, but
terminating abruptly at a lofty mountain northerly. I had no
doubt in my mind of this being the Mount Lofty of Captain
Flinders, or that the range was that immediately to the eastward
of St. Vincent's Gulf. Between us and the ranges a beautiful
promontory shot out into the lake, being a continuation of the
right bank of the Murray. Over this promontory the waters
stretched to the base of the ranges and formed an extensive bay.
To the north-west the country was exceedingly low, but distant
peaks were just visible over it. To the south-west a bold
headland showed itself, beyond which, to the westward, there was
a clear and open sea visible through a strait formed by this
headland, and a point projecting from the opposite shore. To the
east and south-east the country was low, excepting the left shore
of the lake, which was backed by some minor elevations, crowned
with cypresses. Even while gazing on this fine scene I could not
but regret that the Murray had thus terminated, for I immediately
foresaw that in all probability we should be disappointed in
finding any practicable communication between the lake and the
ocean, as it was evident that the former was not much influenced
by tides."</p>
<p>The Murray at this dep&ocirc;t, and forty miles from its
mouth, was found to be 350 yards wide, and from twenty to
twenty-five feet deep. Finding the wind too boisterous to cross
the lake, tents were pitched on a low tract of land that
stretched apparently for many miles to the eastward. It was of
the richest soil, being a black vegetable deposit. Encouraged by
the appearance of the country. Captain Sturt, accompanied by
MacLeay, walked out to examine it from some hills a little to the
south-east of their camp, and found that the flat extended over
about fifty miles, and was bounded by the elevations that
continued easterly from the left bank of the Murray to the north,
and by a line of rising ground to the south, the whole being
lightly wooded and covered with grass.</p>
<p>"Thirty-three days had now passed over our heads," says
Captain Sturt, "since we left the dep&ocirc;t on the
Murrumbidgee, twenty-six of which had been passed upon the
Murray. We had at length arrived at the grand reservoir of those
waters whose course and fate had previously been involved in such
obscurity. It remained for us to ascertain whether the extensive
sheet of water upon whose bosom we had embarked had any
practicable communication with the ocean, and whether the country
in the neighbourhood of the coast corresponded with that
immediately behind our camp, or kept up its sandy and sterile
character to the very verge of the sea."</p>
<p>In crossing the lake a south-westerly course was pursued,
leaving the great expanse of waters to the north-west, and the
adjacent country unexplored on the downward voyage. A neck of
land extending several miles into the lake was supposed to be an
island from the indentation which takes place near the present
township of Milang. This point, and the one on the opposite
shore, have appropriately been named respectively Point Sturt and
Point MacLeay.</p>
<p>When Sturt reached the shore of Encounter Bay, he found his
stock of provisions so short that he had only just time to visit
the mouth of the Murray and retrace his steps with all possible
speed. The scarcity of provisions was not the only difficulty the
party had to anticipate; some of the native tribes on the banks
of the Murray and down to the sea-coast had shown themselves
hostile to the expedition on its downward journey, and it was not
to be expected that they would be friendly on its return.</p>
<p>The whole of the voyage back was one protracted course of
suffering, but courage never flagged.</p>
<p>"The men were indeed so exhausted in strength," wrote Captain
Sturt, "and their provisions so much reduced by the time they
gained the coast, that I doubted much whether either could hold
out to such place as we might hope for relief. Yet reduced as the
whole of us were from previous exertion, beset as our homeward
path was by difficulty and danger, and involved as our eventual
safety was in obscurity and doubt, I could not but deplore the
necessity that obliged me to recross the Lake Alexandrina (as I
had named it, in honour of the heir-apparent to the British
Crown), and to relinquish the examination of its western shores.
. . . We were borne over its ruffled and agitated surface with
such rapidity that I had scarcely time to view it as we passed,
but, cursory as my glance was, I could not but think I was
leaving behind me the fullest reward of our toil in a country
that would ultimately render our discoveries valuable, and
benefit the colony for whose interests we were engaged. Hurried,
I would repeat, as my view of it was, my eye never fell on a
country of more promising aspect or of more favourable position
than that which occupies the space between the lake and the
ranges of St. Vincent's Gulf, and continuing northerly from Mount
Barker stretches away without any visible boundary."</p>
<p>Exactly six months after their departure, Captain Sturt and
his gallant men were all safely back in Sydney, but in an utterly
exhausted state. They had passed through terrible sufferings, but
their indomitable courage had prevented them from sinking into
despair, which would have resulted in certain death.</p>
<p>In his report to the Colonial Government of New South Wales,
Captain Sturt strongly urged that a further examination of the
coast should be made from the most eastern coast of Encounter Bay
to the head of St. Vincent's Gulf, to ascertain with certainty if
there were any other outlet for the waters of the Murray than the
one he had discovered; the large body of water in the north-west
part of the lake leading him to entertain the hope that there was
a channel in that direction.</p>
<p>Governor Darling lost no time in carrying out this
recommendation, and determined to avail himself of the services
of Captain Collet Barker, who had been Commandant at Raffles Bay,
and more recently had occupied a similar post at the settlement
in Western Australia. He was directed to proceed to Cape Jervis
and carry on his survey from that point. He was accompanied by
Dr. Davis, an assistant-surgeon of his regiment (the 39th Foot),
and Mr. Kent of the Commissariat.</p>
<p>On the 13th of April, 1831, the expedition arrived off Cape
Jervis and proceeded up the eastern side of St. Vincent's
Gulf.</p>
<p>On the 17th Captain Barker, accompanied by Mr. Kent, his
servant Mills, and two soldiers, went on shore. They entered a
narrow inlet at the base of the Mount Lofty ranges and were
delighted with the beauty of the scenery, bearing the appearance
of natural meadows lightly timbered and covered with a variety of
grasses. Finding a rocky glen at the head of the inlet where
there was abundance of water, the party bivouacked for the night,
and on the following morning, leaving the two soldiers at the
resting-place, Captain Barker, Mr. Kent, and the servant kept
along the ridge of the range gradually ascending in the direction
of Mount Lofty. In the course of the day they passed round the
head of a deep ravine whose smooth and grassy sides presented a
beautiful appearance. A few miles from this ravine the party
encamped for the night, and on the following morning passed over
Mount Lofty. After sleeping another night on the ranges, they
rejoined the soldiers, who had obtained an abundant supply of
fish in the mean time. While on Mount Lofty Captain Barker had
observed an indentation in the coast to the north-west, and now
proceeded to examine it. Little, of course, did he imagine that
this inlet would, in a few years, become the harbour of the
capital of a flourishing colony, and still less did he suppose
that, within the same period, the uninhabited plains he had seen
from the summit of Mount Lofty would be teeming with a busy
population, and be skirted with the villa residences of the more
wealthy and successful of the colonists. Between the inlet just
referred to, and the one entered by the party on the 17th,
Captain Barker discovered a small clear stream to which he gave
the name of the "Sturt", after the gallant discoverer of the
Murray.</p>
<p>Captain Barker and his former land-party next went ashore in a
small bay behind Cape Jervis, and found themselves, on landing,
in a rich and fertile valley, probably the Rapid Bay of a later
date. Crossing over the ranges, they obtained a view of Encounter
Bay, and proceeding still further to the north-east along the
summit of the hill, they saw Lake Alexandrina and the channel of
its communication with the sea. From this they descended towards
the channel close to the sand hillock upon which Captain Sturt
had pitched his tent before his return journey up the Murray, and
then kept along the beach until they reached the sea mouth.
Captain Barker judged the breadth of the channel to be a quarter
of a mile, and being anxious to take bearings, and to ascertain
the nature of the strand beyond it to the eastward, he
determined, notwithstanding the remonstrances of his people, to
swim across. Unfortunately he was the only one of the party who
could swim well enough for the purpose. He stripped and swam
across with his compass fastened on his head, with difficulty
gaining the opposite side, and then he was seen to ascend the
hillock ** and take several bearings. He then descended on the
further side&mdash;and was never seen again. For a long time his
comrades waited in anxious suspense; then some of them heard, or
thought they heard, a sharp sudden cry. Evening advanced without
any sign of Captain Barker's return, but when night set in the
terrible explanation came. Upon the sandhill the doomed man had
ascended, the natives had lighted a chain of small fires, around
which their women were chanting a melancholy dirge. It struck
upon the ears of the listeners with an ominous thrill, and
assured them of the irreparable loss they had sustained.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Now called Barker's Knoll.]</p>
<p>As the only means of ascertaining definitely their leader's
fate, they sought the assistance of the sealers on Kangaroo
Island, when, for a certain reward, one of the men agreed to
accompany Mr. Kent to the mainland with a native woman who would
communicate with the tribe supposed to have committed the murder.
It transpired that the natives, fearful, it was alleged, of the
instrument Captain Barker carried in his hand, closed upon him
and speared him to death, afterwards throwing the body into deep
water, where the sea-tide would carry it away.</p>
<p>It was reported that the natives who committed this cruel act
"were influenced by no other motive than curiosity to ascertain
if they had power to kill a white man." "But," says Captain
Sturt, who wrote an account of Captain Barker's expedition and
its melancholy termination, "we must be careful in giving credit
to this, for it is much more probable that the cruelties
exercised by the sealers towards the blacks along the south coast
may have instigated the latter to take vengeance on the innocent
as well as on the guilty." The sandhill on the right side of the
mouth of the Murray has been appropriately designated Barker's
Knoll, to commemorate the tragic event.</p>
<p>Sad as the termination was, good was effected by the
expedition, and from the account furnished by Mr. Kent, Captain
Sturt was able to report&mdash;</p>
<p>"It would appear that a spot has at length been found upon the
south coast of New Holland to which the colonist might venture
with every prospect of success, and in whose valleys the exile
might hope to build for himself and for his family a peaceful and
prosperous home. All who have ever landed upon the eastern shore
of St. Vincent's Gulf agree as to the richness of its soil and
the abundance of its pastures. Indeed, if we cast our eyes upon
the chart and examine the natural features of the country behind
Cape Jervis, we shall no longer wonder at its differing in soil
and fertility from the low and sandy tracts that generally
prevail along the shores of Australia."</p>
<p>The account of the discoveries of Sturt and Barker were
received with enthusiasm in Great Britain, and led to practical
steps being taken for the formation of a settlement on the
southern shores of Australia.</p>

<p>T<small>HERE</small> are no startling incidents to record in
connection with the early attempts to found a colony in South
Australia, although it is a story of protracted struggle against
difficulties, of indomitable energy and perseverance, and of
final success. The novelty of the scheme of colonization
propounded, the untried character of the principles upon which it
was proposed to establish the colony, the limited knowledge of
the territory to be occupied, combined to give the Parliament and
the public an idea that the well-meaning projectors were
visionaries and enthusiasts seeking to establish a Utopian
settlement. Nevertheless the development of the scheme was
watched with interest, even by those who did not believe it would
issue in success; while the opposition of a few, who had the
prosperity of other colonies at heart, only tended to give
impetus to the labours of the fathers and founders of South
Australia.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to trace some of the causes leading to the
popularity of colonial questions in the early part of this
century.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the European War in 1815 disposed the minds
of the people to turn from foreign campaigns to the peaceful
concerns of life, and colonization became a topic of general
conversation.</p>
<p>Emphasis was given to it a few years later. The commerce of
the country had suffered unwonted fluctuations, thousands of
families were out of employment, population was rapidly
increasing, trade was in an unsatisfactory state, and many who
took a patriotic and benevolent interest in their fellows were
asking, "What will the future present to the rising
generation?"</p>
<p>Little was known generally in those days of the expansive
nature of trade, which might be created by the lowering of duties
upon imports and the removal of restrictions, and emigration
appeared the most feasible remedy for the impending dangers. By
removing the surplus population to some British colony the mother
country would be relieved, and at the same time new markets would
be originated for the manufactures of the parent state.</p>
<p>In course of time New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land began
to attract attention; the climate was fine and salubrious, and
particularly well adapted for pastoral pursuits; many of the
early convicts who had obtained their freedom were making large
fortunes by sheep-farming, and found a ready sale for their wool
in the English markets. But with all these and other attractions,
the fact that these places were penal settlements operated
powerfully against any attempt to promote a free emigration to
these colonies.</p>
<p>In August, 1829, the colonization of the Swan River
Settlement, Western Australia, was commenced, and met with great
favour from the public at the time, so that many respectable
families joined the early expeditions there. But the colony was
founded on a very imperfect basis, and proved a source of
disappointment to almost all connected with it. Large grants of
land were made to several persons, in one instance to the
enormous extent of half a million of acres which the individual
was allowed to select before the expedition sailed. Of course he
chose his land in the immediate vicinity of the port, and
consequently the other emigrants had to go beyond this vast tract
before they could settle. The remainder of the land was sold at
the low price of one shilling and sixpence per acre, enabling all
to become purchasers. The consequence was that labourers taken
out from England to cultivate the soil soon found that they could
command their own prices, broke the engagements with their
employers, and shortly became landed proprietors themselves. Thus
there was land in abundance, but little capital, and
comparatively no labour. Lacking these first essentials, the
colony progressed so slowly that in 1848, nineteen years after
its formation, the population, which in 1832 was 1540, had only
increased to 4622.</p>
<p>A great impetus was given to colonization by Mr. Edward Gibbon
Wakefield, who circulated a new theory as to the causes of
failure and success in modern colonies, and laid down the
principles which he conceived should be observed in their
foundation and establishment. It was against the system of free
grants and the low price of Crown lands that he grounded his
chief objections in his works on colonization,* attributing the
slow growth of the early English colonies mainly to these
causes.</p>
<p class="foot">[* "A View of the Art of Colonization" (1829).
"England and America: a Comparison of the Social and Political
State of both Nations." 2 vols., 8vo. The second volume contained
a treatise on colonization, published 1833.]</p>
<p>His argument was the futility of attempting to secure hired
labour side by side with great cheapness of land; and that the
exchange of land for labour was the only method of realizing a
just proportion between land, labour, and capital. He contended
strenuously for this principle&mdash;"the universal sale of land
instead of land-grants, and the exclusive employment of the
purchaser's money to promote emigration."</p>
<p>It was in the same year that the Swan River Settlement was
formed (1829) that Captain Sturt, the Government Surveyor in New
South Wales, set forth from Sydney on the exploring expedition to
trace the course of the Murrumbidgee River. When his discoveries
were made known in Great Britain, they attracted the attention of
a number of influential men who had long been favourable to
emigration, and they determined to take active steps to found a
new and free colony in South Australia on the plan put forth by
Mr. Wakefield, to embrace the following principles: "That no free
grants of land should be made, but that it should be sold at an
upset price of not less than twelve shillings per acre nor more
than twenty shillings. The money so obtained should form a fund
for giving free passages to qualified labourers and mechanics
with their wives and families; the colony to bear all its own
charges, and to have the principal management of its own
affairs." It was thought that the high price of land would
prevent the purchase of more than was likely to be cultivated,
that the supply of labourers would be in proportion to the land
bought, and that the population would be concentrated.</p>
<p>The first practical attempt to found a colony on the southern
shores of Australia was made by two or three parties of intending
colonists, who were prepared to purchase a tract of land on
certain conditions similar to those enumerated above. They placed
themselves in communication with Mr. Robert Gouger, who was
interested in colonization generally, and was an enthusiastic
advocate of the principles laid down by Wakefield. Anxious to see
them practically applied, he succeeded in forming two or three
provisional committees, but failing to secure either a sufficient
subscribed capital, or the adherence of well-known public men,
the Government did not regard his proposals with favour, and the
matter dropped for a time.</p>
<p>Little by little, however, attention to the subject grew. In
1830 the Colonization Society, formed for the purpose of
collecting and diffusing information as to the best plans for
establishing colonies, adopted the leading features of
Wakefield's scheme as the basis of any operations of a fixed and
definite character they might undertake, but no attempt to found
a colony in South Australia was made by this society as such,
although many of its members afterwards identified themselves
with the South Australian Association.</p>
<p>In 1831, when the valuable discoveries of Captain Sturt became
more fully known in England, a party of intending colonists at
once made proposals to the Government, through the intervention
of Major Bacon, for the establishment of a chartered colony in
South Australia. But Mr. Hay, Under Secretary of State for the
Colonies, promptly threw cold water on the scheme. It was
understood, however, that his successor. Lord Howick,** regarded
the project with favour.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Afterwards Earl Grey.]</p>
<p>About this time Mr. Wakefield and Major Bacon sought the
co-operation of Colonel Torrens in Parliament. Under the
impression that Lord Howick was favourable. Colonel Torrens
entered warmly into the matter, and introduced to Lord Goderich,
Secretary of State for the Colonies, a deputation including Major
Bacon, Mr. Gouger, and Mr. Graham, when an outline of the
proposed scheme was submitted to him, and it was inferred that
his approval was also given. One part of the principle had
already received the sanction of the Government, and had been put
into operation in New South Wales, where, prior to 1831, the
waste lands were granted free on certain conditions, but had
since been put up for sale. "To Lord Howick," says Colonel
Torrens, in the introduction to his work on "Colonization",
"belongs the honour of having been the first to give practical
operation to the principle of selling the colonial lands at the
disposal of the Crown, and of employing the proceeds of the sale
in conveying voluntary emigrants to the colonies."</p>
<p>In the belief that the Government approved the scheme of the
intending colonists, the friends of the movement proceeded to
carry it out, and an advertisement appeared in the
<em>Spectator</em> to the effect that the Government had given
its sanction to the plan. But when this advertisement caught the
eye of Lord Howick, he issued a memorandum, stating "it was a
mistake to affirm that the Government had given its sanction to
the plan proposed, and that the terms of approbation in which he
expressed himself individually to Major Bacon ought not to have
been so construed." He added that he considered it necessary for
the Government to have some guarantee in the shape of a
subscription list before the matter could be entertained.</p>
<p>To this end Mr. Gouger, with others, again set to work. A
provisional committee was formed, and in June, 1832, Colonel
Torrens, the chairman, drew up and submitted to Lord Goderich the
draft of a charter. It was much too comprehensive a document,
fixing the boundaries of the proposed settlement, the sources of
capital, the classes of emigrants to be sent out, the powers to
be granted to the company, the form of government, and many other
details with regard to the emigration of foreigners, the sale of
land, the raising of a militia, and the levying of a land
tax.</p>
<p>Lord Goderich, "having bestowed the most careful attention
upon the various provisions of the instrument," stated in reply
that "the transmission of the proposed charter afforded the first
occasion which had presented itself during the discussions on
this subject for taking a clear and comprehensive view of the
plan in all its bearings," and then proceeded to cut the whole
scheme to pieces. He objected to the charter on the ground, among
other things, that it would virtually transfer to a company the
sovereignty of a vast unexplored territory; that it would
encroach upon the limits of existing colonies; that the proposal
to throw open the settlement to foreigners would give them an
equality with British subjects; that the objects of the
corporation were defined with far too much latitude as to the
employment of their capital; that the investiture of the power of
legislation was not sufficiently safeguarded; that they would
exclude the King from imposing duties of custom; that a freedom
of trade was proposed to which the Navigation and Trades Acts
were in opposition; that it was proposed to erect within the
British monarchy a government purely republican; and, finally,
that they would be the receivers of large sums of public money
for the due application of which they did not propose to give any
specific security.</p>
<p>Upon Colonel Torrens the task devolved of seeking to remove
some of these objections, and of placing matters in a less
objectionable light; but although a lengthy correspondence
ensued, and a willingness was expressed by the colonel, on behalf
of the provisional committee, to considerably modify the draft
charter as might be deemed proper and expedient, reserving only
the principle of land sales, the application of the proceeds to
emigration, and the eventual privilege of a legislative assembly,
the main gist of Lord Goderich's reply was that "as the committee
were so ready to abandon essential provisions of their scheme, he
had serious misgivings as to the maturity of their knowledge and
counsel on the very important subject which they had submitted to
his consideration."</p>
<p>So ended the negotiations with his Majesty's Government in
1832. The error was in asking too much, and then too little, the
result being that they got nothing at all. The provisional
committee was broken up, and the intending emigrants took their
departure to America and the United States instead of to South
Australia.</p>
<p>On the 6th of July, 1833, negotiations with the Government
were resumed, and a modified plan for establishing a colony on
the southern coast of Australia was submitted by Mr. W. Woolrych
Whitmore, M.P., to Mr. E.G. Stanley, successor to Lord Goderich
in the Colonial Office. It contemplated the purchase of land by a
joint stock company, and by private individuals, and with the
proceeds arising from such sales to send out the pauper or
unemployed population of the United Kingdom; the expense of
establishing the colony to be borne by the company, and a land
tax levied to defray the cost of government, the company having
the right of pre-emption of one million acres of land at five
shillings per acre.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to give the whole scheme in detail, which
to a certain extent the Secretary of State received with favour,
but suggested so many hard conditions and modifications that the
negotiations were abruptly broken off.</p>
<p>Official rebuffs did not in any way damp the ardour of the
persistent band of men who had the colonization scheme at heart,
and they determined, with the assistance of Mr. Gouger, to make
renewed efforts, and enlarge the sphere of their influence.
Accordingly, in the early part of 1834, a powerful and
influential body&mdash;at least, so far as names were
concerned&mdash;was formed, under the designation of "The South
Australian Association", of which Mr. W.W. Whitmore, M.P., was
chairman, George Grote, M.P. (the historian of Greece),
treasurer, and Mr. Robert Gouger secretary.</p>
<p>The provisional committee&mdash;all of whom were, of course,
in sympathy with the movement, although, as is usual in such
cases, the active work devolved upon a few&mdash;was composed of
the following well-known men:&mdash;</p>

<p>A draft charter of incorporation was very carefully drawn up
and submitted to the Colonial Secretary, and then ensued the
inevitable correspondence and discussion. One of the points in
dispute was whether the proposed settlement should be a chartered
colony or a Crown colony, the difference being, according to the
definition of Mr. Grote, that "a colony founded by charter is an
example of that delegation of authority which, in perpetual
succession, has for ages been a leading principle of the British
Government,* while a colony founded by the Crown is an example of
that central authority, acting at whatever distance from the seat
of Government, by means of temporary agents, which is a leading
principle of the French Government."</p>
<p class="foot">[* Cases were cited from the year 1578 to
1791.]</p>
<p>The association soon found that there was little hope of the
Government consenting to the foundation of a chartered colony in
South Australia, and accordingly they passed a resolution to the
effect that if his Majesty's Government would obtain from
Parliament the authority necessary for planting a Crown colony
there, provision being made in the Act for the permanent
establishment of that mode of disposing of waste land, and of the
purchase of such land, which had been recommended by the
committee, coupled with provision for good government, the South
Australian Association should continue its existence as a private
and temporary society for the purpose of promoting the success of
the measure.</p>
<p>Matters were now on a fair footing, and Mr. Gouger soon
afterwards forwarded to the Colonial Secretary a rough draft of
the proposed Bill. Just as the energetic and persevering friends
of South Australia were, as it appeared, on the eve of success,
there was a change of administration in the Colonial Office, Mr.
Spring Rice ** succeeding Mr. Stanley as Secretary of State for
the Colonies, and a delay arose.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Afterwards Lord Monteagle.]</p>
<p>But it was not for long, and in the end it was not
disadvantageous, for Mr. Spring Rice took up the matter
energetically, and at once expressed his willingness to
recommend, on certain unprohibitive conditions, the passing of a
Bill on the principles laid down by Mr. Gouger in his rough
draft.</p>
<p>The long-looked-for day at length arrived, when "a Bill to
erect South Australia into a British province, and to provide for
the colonization and government thereof," was brought before the
House of Commons by Mr. Whitmore, with the sanction and approval
of the Colonial Secretary. Here it had many friends and
supporters&mdash;Lord Howick, Mr. J. Shaw Lefevre, Lord Stanley,
and Mr. Spring Rice, together with some of the parliamentary
members of the provisional committee, doing yeomen's service; and
it passed the third reading without any serious hindrance. In the
House of Lords the Bill was introduced by the Marquis of
Normanby, and was so warmly supported by the Duke of Wellington
that the opposition, which at one time threatened to be
dangerous, was overcome.* He expressed himself as deeply
interested in this new experiment in colonization, and desired
that it might have a fair trial. He also recommended that Colonel
Light, his companion in arms, should be the first
surveyor-general of the new colony.</p>
<p class="foot">[* For these good services Wakefield was anxious
that the capital of the new colony should be named Wellington,
but in this he was, as he says, "shabbily frustrated".]</p>
<p>On the 15th of August, 1834, the last day of the session, the
Bill received the royal assent.</p>
<p>The leading features of the Act (4 &amp; 5 Will. IV. cap. 95)
were briefly as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>The territory to extend from the 132nd to the 141st degree of
east longitude, and from the south coast, including the adjacent
islands, northwards to the tropic of Capricorn; the whole of [the
territory within the above limits to be open to settlement by
British subjects; it was not to be subject to the laws of other
colonies, but only to those expressly enacted for itself; in no
case were convicted felons to be landed on its shores; all public
lands were to be open for purchase by cash, the minimum price
being twelve shillings per acre; the sale of such lands to be
under the management of a Board of Commissioners empowered to
give a title in fee-simple to each purchaser; the whole of the
money derived from the sale of waste lands to be employed in
conveying labourers, natives of Great Britain and Ireland, to the
colony, the labourers so conveyed to be an equal number of both
sexes, preference being given to young married people without
children, so that purchasers of land might obtain labour for its
cultivation; the affairs of the colony to be regulated by the
Commissioners until a certain population was reached, at which
time a representative assembly should be entrusted with the
duties of government, upon the condition that it undertook to
discharge any existing colonial debt.</p>
<p>So far all was smooth sailing. But, carefully sandwiched
between clauses which could not fail to give satisfaction, the
Act further provided that no part of the expense of founding or
governing the colony should fall on the mother country, and it
authorized the Commissioners to borrow money <i>on security of
the colony</i> to the extent of &pound;200,000, but &pound;20,000
of the money so borrowed was to be invested in exchequer bills in
the names of trustees to be appointed by his Majesty.</p>
<p>The concluding clause of the Act nearly rendered the whole
measure inoperative; it restrained the Commissioners from
entering upon the exercise of their general powers until they had
invested the required &pound;20,000 in exchequer bills, and until
&pound;35,000 worth of land had been sold.</p>
<p>This was the <i>crux</i>. However desirable the country might
be considered for emigration, no sane person could be expected to
invest his money in land there until he had the assurance that a
colony would be founded and a government established.</p>
<p>A glance at the Act (a rough outline only is given above) will
show that the original propositions of the projectors of the
colony had, in the course of the negotiations and the passage of
the Bill through Parliament, undergone many important revisions,
until almost the only things granted that were at first asked
were the disposal of the waste lands at a uniform price, and the
application of the proceeds to the purposes of emigration. Some
of the features of a chartered colony were retained, but in the
main they were those of a Crown colony, the Crown, however,
agreeing to delegate almost absolute power and authority to a
Board of Commissioners.</p>
<p>The provisions for the disposal of public lands presented two
or three marked peculiarities. The title in the first instance
was not to be direct from the Crown, but from the Commissioners,
to whom the Act gave the power of sale; it was to be in
fee-simple, and no royalty or reservation whatever was to be made
by the Crown, so that all above and below the soil was to be
unreservedly the property of the purchaser.</p>
<p>Although the Act did not in all respects meet the wishes or
the anticipations of the projectors, it nevertheless embodied
certain admirable and novel principles. It provided for the sale
of <i>all</i> public lands at a uniform price, and the
possibility of free grants being thereby precluded, it seemed
that the chief cause of previous failure in planting colonies was
obviated. The colony was never to be subjected to the curse of
convictism. The settlement of population was to be regulated in
groups, in order to secure the advantages of neighbouring
communities. To this end lands generally were to be surveyed in
small blocks of eighty acres. The sales were to be by public
auction, so that the evils of large monopolies might, to a great
extent, be avoided.</p>
<p>"In the old colonies," said Mr. John Stephens,** "vast tracts
of land were granted to favourites; in South Australia no land
whatever is granted on any other terms than the payment of a
fixed price per acre. In the old colonies there has always been a
deficiency of labourers, and, if capitalists imported them, land
was so cheap that they immediately ceased to work for hire, and
without adequate capital began to be farmers on their own
account; the result of which was, that the largest possible
quantity of land was cultivated in the worst possible manner. But
in South Australia a remedy, at once simple and effectual, has
been provided, the whole net proceeds of the sales of land being
appropriated to give a free passage to young and industrious
emigrants of both sexes, by which means the capitalists will be
ensured an adequate supply of labour. Thus the purchaser does not
buy land so much as the facility of obtaining combined
labour&mdash;that which alone makes land valuable. Here, then, is
the first attempt, in the history of colonization, to plant a
colony upon correct principles&mdash;to ensure to the labourer
employment, and to the capitalist an ample supply of labour."</p>
<p class="foot">[** "Rise and Progress of South Australia"
(1839).]</p>
<p>Colonel Torrens, expatiating on this grand feature in the new
sphere of colonization, a few years later in the House of
Commons, said, as the result of the experiment, "I am not merely
prepared to show that emigration would cost less than maintaining
paupers in their parishes at home, and would thus prove a measure
of permanent economy and retrenchment; I am prepared to go much
further than this. I am prepared to prove both theoretically and
practically that emigration may be so conducted as to replace
with interest the whole of the expenditure incurred in effecting
it, and to aid the finances of the country by opening new and not
inconsiderable sources of direct public revenue."</p>
<p>The difficulties of the projectors of the new colony did not
cease, as some had been sanguine enough to imagine, with the
passing of the Act.</p>
<p>A Board of Commissioners was duly appointed,*** and at once
the question arose how the money required to be invested before
any valid steps could be taken, was to be raised. For six months
they met at intervals to discuss the problem, but as they did not
come any nearer to a solution, they availed themselves of a
change of ministry at the end of 1834 as a fitting opportunity
for tendering their resignations, although, of course, they were
appointed to give effect to the Act of the Legislature, and their
functions as Colonization Commissioners had nothing whatever to
do with party politics.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** The first Board of Commissioners was
composed as follows: J.W. Childers, M.P., W. Clay, M.P., G.
Grote, M.P., G.W. Norman, Colonel Torrens, M.P., and W.W.
Whitmore, M.P., chairman. Mr. Rowland Hill (afterwards Sir
Rowland Hill, who introduced the Penny Postal System) was
appointed secretary to the board.]</p>
<p>On the 5th of May, 1835, the first public act of Lord Glenelg,
on taking office as Secretary of State for the Colonies, after
the change of ministry, was to gazette as Colonization
Commissioners the following: G.F. Angas, E. Barnard *
(Agent-General for the Australian colonies), W. Hutt,* John Shaw
Lefevre * (late Under Secretary of State), W.A. Mackinnon, M.P.,
S. Mills, Jacob Montefiore, G. Palmer, jun., J. Wright, Colonel
Torrens, chairman, and Rowland Hill, secretary.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Those gentlemen against whose names an
asterisk is placed were nominees of Lord Glenelg.]</p>
<p>The difficulties which their predecessors had regarded as
insurmountable, the new Board faced with courage and resolution.
They had to raise the required guarantees before any act of
theirs would be valid. "The difficulty of accomplishing these
objects," said Colonel Torrens, "will be immediately perceived
when it is considered that South Australia was at that period an
unexplored wilderness, and that the colony, the revenue of which
was to be the security for the proposed loan, was not then in
existence. But this was not all. Before they could proceed to
sell land in the wilderness, or raise a loan upon the security of
revenues which remained to be created, it was necessary that
considerable expense should be incurred in providing offices,
engaging clerks and agents, and in explaining to the public the
principles and the prospects of the new colony by printed papers
and advertisements."</p>
<p>Application was made to the Colonial Department for the use of
offices and the privilege of free postage, but even these small
requests were not granted. A loan of &pound;1000 was soon raised
to meet the preliminary expenses, but the graver matter was not
so easily disposed of.</p>
<p>The first regulations for the sale of South Australian lands
were published by the Commissioners in June, 1835. They had
"considered it their duty to attempt realizing a price
considerably higher than the minimum of 12<i>s</i>. per acre
required in the Act of Parliament," and, "after mature
consideration", the price was fixed at 20<i>s</i>. per acre in
the first instance, or for a lot consisting of one town acre, and
a country section of 80 acres, &pound;80. Priority of choice with
regard to both town acres and country sections was to be given to
the holders of the first 437 land orders secured in England. In
addition to the 81-acre allotments, any one paying the price of
4000 acres of land, or upwards, was to have the right of a
special survey in any compact district not exceeding 16,000
acres, and select his 4000 acres from such district before any
other application would be entertained. Brilliant opportunities!
but no one seemed to care to avail himself of them.</p>
<p>For two months the Commissioners exerted all their energies to
promote the sale of land, and every effort was made to give the
experiment a fair trial. Circulars were issued with maps and
pressing appeals; the best agents were appointed, and it was
proposed to delegate some of the powers and honours of the
Commissioners to gentlemen of rank, talent, and influence in the
counties who might form the members of future associations. But
all to no purpose. Not half of the required quantity had been
disposed of when there came a pause; the length of their tether
had been reached, and it seemed that, as there was nothing
further they could do, the whole thing must collapse.</p>
<p>It was at this juncture that one of the Commissioners, Mr.
George Fife Angas, a wealthy merchant, who had for some years
been quietly working in the interests of the proposed new colony,
came forward as leader of the forlorn hope&mdash;brought forward
and carried into effect a scheme without which the colonization
of South Australia, under the conditions of the Act of
Parliament, would have been utterly impossible.</p>

<p>"W<small>ITHOUT</small> some collateral association to assist
the Commissioners," said Mr. George Fife Angas to his colleagues
on the Board, "I do not see how the Act is to be carried into
effect." He then proceeded to unfold a scheme, which was, in
brief, that a joint stock company should be formed with
sufficient capital to purchase the requisite quantity of land; to
take out its own agents, servants, and other emigrants, and
supply them with provisions while they carried on operations of a
reproductive and remunerative character; and to provide the
capital for the working of the colonial Government.</p>
<p>At first the Commissioners strongly demurred to the suggestion
of Mr. Angas, but when at length they saw that without such
assistance they were powerless to act, and might as well tender
their resignations, they confessed this happy thought was the
only practical idea that had come before them, and they gave
their unanimous consent to the effort being made.</p>
<p>Mr. Angas was ready to act on the moment, and, assisted by Mr.
Henry Kingscote and Mr. Thomas Smith, at once subscribed
sufficient capital to purchase the whole of the unsold land, to
be handed over to the Company, when formed, at cost price, with
interest at five per cent. This purchase was the basis of the
operations of the Company, and, as a matter of fact, of all
future operations of the Commissioners, and thus the initial
difficulty in founding a colony under the Act was overcome. But a
concession had to be made by the Commissioners to effect it. The
offer for the purchase of the land was at the reduced rate of
12<i>s</i>. per acre, partly because it was evident there were no
more purchasers to be obtained at &pound;1 per acre, and partly
because this reduced price would be an incentive to capitalists
to invest in the proposed Company. This offer was accepted, and,
to avoid clashing with the previous sales, the size of the
country sections was altered to 134 acres and one town acre,
instead of eighty acres and one town acre; hence the difference
between a "preliminary land order" and one subsequently granted.
In addition, the Commissioners resolved to sell at 12<i>s</i>.
per acre to any who could give proof that they were prepared to
take out adequate capital for the improvement of the colony; but
this price was only available until the 1st of March, 1836, after
which date the price was to be &pound;1 per acre, the sections to
consist of eighty acres as at first, and the sales to take place
in the colony.</p>
<p>Having disposed, so far, of difficulty number one, the next
question was how to raise the required guarantee sum of
&pound;20,000 to invest in the names of trustees. Having power to
raise &pound;200,000 if they could, the Commissioners threw open
for tender by the public the sum of &pound;80,000, as offering
greater inducements to capitalists than the smaller sum. The
proposals were well advertised in the London papers and by
circular, but at the end of the time specified, only six tenders
were sent in for a total amount of &pound;13,000, at not less
than ten per cent. interest, and with conditions that could not
possibly be accepted.</p>
<p>The Commissioners then appealed to Mr. Wright, one of the
members of their Board, to undertake the formation of a list, and
after much trouble he was at length able to offer terms to the
Commissioners&mdash;not such as they approved, but, as there was
no alternative, they agreed to accept, and on the 19th of
November, 1835, the &pound;20,000 was invested in the names of
three trustees in the three per cent. consols. The two great
difficulties having now been overcome, the Commissioners at last
saw a prospect of putting the necessary machinery in motion for
founding the colony.</p>
<p>The origin of the South Australian Company is so intimately
associated with the establishment of the colony, that we must now
turn our attention to its operations.</p>
<p>It was no easy matter to start it. The capital was fixed at
&pound;500,000, with power to increase it to &pound;1,000,000;
but operations were to commence when the subscriptions reached
&pound;200,000. No smaller sum would suffice, for Mr. Angas was
persuaded that no capitalists would embark their money in the
distant colony unless the Company engaged to introduce ample
capital and labour; and this, of course, enhanced the
difficulty.</p>
<p>"We had," said Mr. Angas, upon whose shoulders the whole
burden of the undertaking rested&mdash;" we had, as it were, to
go to the capitalists of this kingdom and say, 'Gentlemen, lend
us your money to carry out this scheme, notwithstanding there has
not yet been an acre of land surveyed, nor a British harbour
formed. Advance it to us on the faith of our settled conviction,
notwithstanding its difficulties, that the project is quite
practicable; that from the information we possess of the country
we believe it must succeed; for the Act of Parliament presents
advantages in the secure title it gives to the property, and the
liberal principles of its government, that, under the blessing of
Providence and the use of proper means, will eventually lead to a
rich reward for your confidence.' This appeal," he continues, "we
had to make, not only with public opinion adverse to us (a strong
prejudice existed against some of the early projectors of the new
system of colonization, of which we had in some degree to endure
the consequences), the Government at that time lukewarm, and many
of the members of each House of Parliament opposed to the whole
project, but also a formidable opposition from powerful
individuals resident in this country, who were deeply interested
in the rival colonies of Western Australia, Van Diemen's Land,
and New South Wales, besides the contempt thrown on the plan by
the public press of these colonies themselves, although the
writers should have seen that, if successful, it would of
necessity become an important element of their own advancement.
Above all, we had to meet the prejudices of many who, not having
studied the principles and plans of our undertaking, concluded
that it was purely Utopian."</p>
<p>In spite of all difficulties, on the 22nd of January, 1836,
the South Australian Company was formed, with a subscribed
capital of &pound;200,000. The original directors of the Company
were&mdash;George Fife Angas (chairman), Raikes Currie, M.P.,
Charles Hindley, M.P., James Hyde, Henry Kingscote, John Pirie
(alderman), John Rundle, M.P., Thomas Smith, James Ruddall Todd,
and Henry Waymouth.</p>
<p>The objects contemplated by the proprietary were: (1) The
erection upon their town land of wharves, warehouses, and
dwelling-houses, and letting the same to the colonists, or
otherwise disposing of them. (2) The improvement and cultivation
of their country land, and the leasing or sale of part of it if
deemed expedient. (3) The laying out of farms, the erection of
suitable buildings thereon, and letting the same to industrious
tenants on lease, with the right of purchase before the
expiration of such lease at a price to be fixed at the time of
the tenant taking possession. (4) The growth of wool for the
European markets. (5) The pursuit of whale, seal, and other
fisheries in the gulfs and seas around the colony, and the curing
and salting of fish suitable for exportation. (6) The salting and
curing of beef and pork for the stores of ships and for the
purpose of general export. (7) The establishment of a bank or
banks in, or connected with, the colony, making loans on the
security of land or produce, and the conducting of such banking
operations as the directors might think expedient.</p>
<p>Although these were set forth as the primary objects of the
Company, it was soon found that they were not sufficiently
comprehensive. In order to give confidence to intending
shareholders, and to ensure the successful establishment of the
infant settlement, the directors had to consider what trades
would be imperatively required, so as not to leave their manager
without needful aid; to select, contract with, and provide the
requisite tools for carpenters, brickmakers, lime-burners,
blacksmiths, boat-builders, fishermen, and others, and generally
to supply everything that would be needful, from the keels of
whale-ships to pins and needles.</p>
<p>With the formation of the South Australian Company, as none of
his Majesty's Commissioners were allowed to have any pecuniary
interest in the colony they were appointed to establish, Mr.
Angas felt it to be his duty at once to tender his resignation as
a member of that Board. He was requested, however, to retain his
position until the end of the year 1835, and was thus able to see
all the preliminary measures required by the Act completed, and
was permitted to nominate his successor, Mr. Josiah Roberts. Mr.
Wright also, and on the same grounds, retired from the Board.</p>
<p>Such was the vigour with which the directors of the South
Australian Company entered upon their work, that on the 22nd of
February, exactly one month from the formation of the Company,
not only had all the preliminaries been successfully
arranged&mdash;secretary, clerks for London office, colonial
manager, and overseers for each department appointed, and
instructed in the measures they were to adopt on their arrival in
the colony&mdash;but, what is almost incredible, the ship John
Pirie had been chartered, and was under weigh fully laden with
goods, live stock, and twenty-three adult passengers. Two days
later the <i>Duke of York</i>, freighted with whaling stores and
having on board forty-two passengers, including the colonial
manager, Mr. S. Stephens, and other officers and servants of the
Company, was also ready for sea, and both vessels immediately
proceeded on their voyage.</p>
<p>Two other ships, the <i>Lady Mary Pelham</i> and the
<i>Emma</i>, freighted with whaling and general stores, and
together taking out fifty-one passengers, left England in March
and April respectively.</p>
<p>All the Company's vessels were supplied with provisions equal
to one year's consumption, and in the event of accident or loss
sustained on the voyage or otherwise, the officers were furnished
with the means of supplying themselves from Van Diemen's Land,
and arrangements were also made for a regular supply of
provisions from Hamburg. Besides the requisites for the voyage,
sheep, cattle, pigs, and other live stock were sent out, so that
the colonists on landing might have an immediate supply of fresh
food, without which they would probably have suffered as did the
early settlers in the North American colonies.</p>
<p>The whole of the early proceedings of the Company were
characterized by great energy, mainly through the zeal and
liberality of Mr. Angas, its founder and chairman, who allowed
the necessary business to be carried on in his own offices,
placed at its disposal at prime cost several vessels with their
equipments and provisions for employment in the South Sea
whale-fishery, handed over at cost price the land which he and
his colleagues had purchased, and in every particular became the
prime mover in the whole concern. "He made more sacrifices in
time, health, and property," says Mr. John Stephens, in his "Rise
and Progress of South Australia", "for the accomplishment of a
public object, than many more wealthy merchants would have made
in the prosecution of a hopeful private enterprise."</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Colonization Commissioners, having succeeded by
the aid of the South Australian Company in fulfilling the
requirements of the Act as regarded the sale of land, and raising
the stipulated loan, proceeded to obtain the Orders in Council
and letters patent for establishing the colony, and to this end
Colonel Torrens, the chairman of the Board, successfully
negotiated with Lord Glenelg, who entered with spirit into the
whole matter, and rendered important service to the
Commissioners.</p>
<p>The next steps were to make choice of a Governor and other
officers, and to provide for their equipment and departure.</p>
<p>The choice of the Commissioners fell upon Colonel Charles
James Napier (afterwards the hero of Scinde) for the office of
Governor. In reply to the invitation of the Board, the colonel
stated that he could not accept the Governorship of South
Australia without troops, and the power to draw upon the British
Government for money in case of need.</p>
<p>With regard to money matters, he observed "that while
sufficient security exists for the supply of labour in the
colony, there does not appear to be any security that the supply
of capital will be sufficient to employ that labour, and if it be
not employed the consequences must be disastrous, t therefore
deem it necessary to have the means of meeting this, and other
accidents which cannot be foreseen, but which inevitably arise in
the execution of all experiments; and the plan of the colony is
an experiment."</p>
<p>As to the troops, he wrote, "I will not attempt to govern a
large body of people in a desert, where they must suffer
considerable inconvenience (if not hardships), without I have a
force to protect what is good against that which is bad; and such
a force is the more necessary which, as in Australia, the supply
of spirituous liquors will be abundant. The colony will be a
small colony without discipline, suffering more or less from
privation, and with plenty of liquor. Experience has taught me
what scenes this would produce unless the leader had a
controlling physical force. Such," he concluded, "are my demands
and my motives for making them."</p>
<p>As both these demands were at variance with the
self-supporting principle on which the colony was to be
established, the negotiations with Colonel Napier fell through,
and Captain (afterwards Admiral Sir John) Hindmarsh, R.N., was
selected and appointed Governor. His career had been remarkable
and adventurous. "He was with Lord Howe on the 1st of June, 1794;
with Admiral Cornwallis in his glorious retreat; with Sir James
Saumarez at Algeciras and in the Straits of Gibraltar; at the
capture of Flushing, of the Isle of France and of Java; with Lord
Cochrane at Basque Roads; and with Nelson both at the Nile and at
Trafalgar.</p>
<p>"At the battle of the Nile he was a midshipman on board the
<i>Bellerophon</i>, and so destructive was the fire of the enemy,
that for some time he was the only officer left upon the
quarter-deck. He received a wound in the head which deprived him
of the sight of one eye, but he did not quit his post. The
enemy's ship, <i>L'Orient</i>, caught fire, and the flames
threatened to communicate to the <i>Bellerophon</i>, when
Hindmarsh, being the only officer on deck, ordered the topsail to
be set and the cable to be cut, and thus saved the ship from
destruction. He had his proud reward; Nelson himself thanked the
young hero before the assembled officers and crew, and repeated
these thanks upon the deck of the <i>Victory</i> when presenting
him with his lieutenant's commission."</p>
<p>The question of salaries to colonial officers was a difficult
one for the Commissioners to settle, as they were anxious to
obtain the services of the most efficient men at the lowest
possible cost; but eventually it was arranged that the salary of
the Governor should be &pound;800 per annum, and an allowance of
&pound;500 for outfit.</p>
<p>The following gentlemen were appointed to offices in the
colony:&mdash;</p>

<p>The appointment of colonial chaplain was made subsequently,
when the Rev. Charles Beaumont Howard was selected, at a salary
of &pound;250.</p>
<p>The next step of the Commissioners was to apply to Lord
Glenelg for a vessel of war to convey the Governor and survey
party to South Australia, and afterwards to be used, for a time,
for surveying purposes. But the application was not entertained;
whereupon the chairman of the South Australian Company, annoyed,
in common with his colleagues, not only at the parsimony of the
Government, but also at the vexatious delay at a critical time,
offered to place one of the Company's pioneer vessels at the
disposal of the Governor and his officers&mdash;an offer which
was, of course, declined, but it had the effect of stirring up
the Colonial Office generally. Meanwhile Captain Hindmarsh had
been beforehand, and had obtained the offer of the
<i>Buffalo</i>, a heavy transport about to proceed to New Zealand
for spars. But this old tub was totally unfit for surveying
purposes, and as in the circumstances the Commissioners
considered it desirable that the survey party should precede the
Governor, the fast-sailing brig <i>Rapid</i>, of a hundred and
sixty-two tons, was purchased, and despatched on the 4th of May,
under the command of Colonel Light, the surveyor-general. Owing
to the indisposition of Colonel Light and other causes, the
<i>Cygnet</i>, another vessel chartered by the Commissioners for
use in the colony during the progress of the surveys, preceded
the <i>Rapid</i> by about six weeks (24th of March), having on
board eighty-four passengers and a division of the survey
party.</p>
<p>The officers sent out by the Commissioners were furnished with
very explicit instructions how they were to act on reaching their
destination. Colonel Light was to land two or three gardeners on
Kangaroo Island, and direct them to bring a small piece of land
into immediate cultivation, stocking it with vegetables for the
use of the colonists generally. He was also to leave the wives
and families of the officers and men with stores and a force
sufficient to protect them from attack.</p>
<p>The colonel was then to make a careful examination of the
coast in the central parts of the colony, excepting only those
places where the previous explorations of Captain Flinders and
others clearly showed that no harbour was to be found. His
attention was to be particularly directed to Nepean Bay and Port
Lincoln, but more especially to the line of coast extending from
the eastern point of Encounter Bay to the northern point of Gulf
St. Vincent. An inlet and harbour reported to have been
discovered by one Captain Jones was to be examined, and Lake
Alexandrina was also to be skirted, with a view to finding an
outlet other than that discovered by Captain Sturt. Further, he
was instructed to find out and survey the best sites for towns
and settlements, and especially for the site of the capital; so
that on the arrival of the Governor and the first body of
emigrants, the whole machinery of the new colony might be at once
set in motion.</p>
<p>As an example of the care taken by the Commissioners, and
particularly by Colonel Torrens, the chairman, who drew up most
of the instructions, a few details may be inserted here of the
directions given to Colonel Light to assist him in determining
the choice of a site for the capital: "In the opinion of the
Commissioners the best site for the first town would be that
which combined in the highest degree the following advantages: A
commodious harbour, safe and accessible at all seasons of the
year; a considerable tract of fertile land immediately adjoining;
an abundant supply of fresh water; facilities for internal
communication and for communication with the port; distance from
the limit of the colony as a means of avoiding interference from
without in the principle of colonization; distance from the
neighbourhood of extensive sheepwalks. All the foregoing are to
be considered of primary importance, and the following of
secondary value: A supply of building material, as timber, stone,
or brick, earth, and lime; facilities for draining, and
coal."</p>
<p>In the exercise of the important duties intrusted to him,
Colonel Light was to make himself acquainted, as far as possible,
with the circumstances which had determined the sites of new
towns in the United States of America, in Canada, and more
especially in the Australian colonies, and he was to pay
particular attention to those which, in the latter colonies, had
led to an actual change, or to the desire for change in the sites
after their first settlement.</p>
<p>Throughout all his proceedings he was to exercise the utmost
caution to prevent collision with the natives, and with this view
he was to avoid any unnecessary division of his party, and take
care that each detachment was placed under the charge of an
officer upon whose intelligence, humanity, caution, temper, and
courage he could fully rely. Wild animals were to be considered
the property of the natives, and, if required for food, to be
purchased. Sporting was accordingly to be discouraged, and in any
parts inhabited by natives prohibited. The colonel was reminded
that not only the safety of his party, but the future security of
the colonists generally, and the state of feeling which would
afterwards exist between the two races, would depend largely on
the attention paid to these instructions.</p>
<p>To the Resident Commissioner and other officers the
instructions prepared by the Commissioners were equally full and
explicit, and they display great judgment, foresight, and
ability.</p>
<p>On the 30th of July, H.M.S. <i>Buffalo</i>, the third vessel
sent out by the Commissioners, followed, with Captain Hindmarsh
and one hundred and seventy-six other passengers on board. The
place of rendezvous, whither eight vessels in all had preceded
the <i>Buffalo</i>, was Nepean Bay, Kangaroo Island.</p>
<br>
<p>"Colonization", wrote Coleridge in 1834 (the year of his
death, and a month after attending the meeting of the British
Association of Science at Cambridge)&mdash;"colonization is an
imperative duty on Great Britain. God seems to hold out His
fingers to us over the sea. But it must be colonization of hope;
not, as has happened, of despair."</p>
<p>And it was so. South Australia was not doomed to the penalty
of land monopoly as in the case of the Swan River Settlement, or
to the contamination and curse of being a penal colony like New
South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. Prinsep, in his "Letters from
Van Diemen's Land", draws a graphic picture of the moral
contagion to which the family of a right-minded emigrant might be
subjected there. "Freemen find so many ways of making money here,
that they will not take service, and so the convicts, or, as they
are delicately called, 'the prisoners', supply all demands of
this nation; and if the histories of every house were made
public, you would shudder; even in our small
<i>m&eacute;nage</i>, our cook has committed murder, our footman
burglary, and our housemaid bigamy!" **</p>
<p class="foot">[** Quoted in Stephens' "Rise and Progress of
South Australia" (1839).]</p>
<p>It was also a distinct advantage that the regulations for the
government of the new colony rested almost entirely in a Board of
Commissioners, whose whole attention could be given to the
subject, instead of being placed, as was the case in the older
colonies, under the Colonial Secretary for the time
being&mdash;"a functionary who has upon his hands the destinies
of millions of people of every clime and every race, and whose
office, being a political one, is changed with every change of
ministry."</p>
<p>Honours are divided among the claimants to be founders of
South Australia. Edward Gibbon Wakefield was the first to set
forth the principles of the new form of colonization; Mr. Gouger,
the secretary of the South Australian Association, took up the
idea, and worked it into practical shape; Colonel Torrens brought
experience and influence to bear to make the scheme popular, and
ensure its acceptance by the Government; while Mr. George Fife
Angas made the working of the Act of Parliament possible.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> first of the South Australian Company's
vessels to arrive at Nepean Bay, Kangaroo Island, was the <i>Duke
of York</i>, freighted with whaling stores and implements, and
having on board Mr. Samuel Stephens, colonial manager of the
Company, eight other passengers of independent means, and
twenty-nine labourers.* She dropped anchor in the bay on the 27th
of July, 1836. Three days later, another of the Company's fleet,
the <i>Lady Mary Pelham</i>, with two settlers and twenty-nine
labourers on board, made her appearance; while the <i>John
Pirie</i>, the first to leave England, laden with twenty-eight
labourers, provisions, and general stores, did not arrive until
the 16th of August.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mr. Thomas Hudson Beare, second in command
under the Company; Mrs. Beare and four children; Miss C.H. Beare,
afterwards Mrs. Samuel Stephens; Mr. D.H. Schryvogle, clerk;
Henry Mitchell, butcher; C. Powell, gardener; Neale, carpenter;
Wm. West, labourer&mdash;the last four being emigrants. The first
duty performed on setting foot ashore was to read the Church of
England Service, in which all joined, the captain (Morgan)
concluding with an extempore thanksgiving prayer for the
prosperous voyage.]</p>
<p>All three vessels, however, reached the colony before the
<i>Rapid</i>, the first ship sent out by the Board of
Commissioners. The first colonist to set foot on the island was
Mr. Samuel Stephens, whose first act was to select a site, and
then to erect upon it a mud hut, surround it by a small battery,
and plant upon the roof the British ensign. But Mr. Stephens and
the first settlers soon found that they were not "monarchs of all
they surveyed," for they were shortly afterwards interviewed by
the lord of the isle, one "Governor" Walker, who had lived there
for many years. His hut stood on a piece of good land some
distance from the shore, in the neighbourhood of fresh water, and
was surrounded with a cleared and well-cultivated piece of
ground.** The only other residents on the island were a few
sealers, whalers, and convicts who had escaped from the
neighbouring penal settlements.</p>
<p class="foot">[** "Governor" Walker continued to reside on the
island for nearly ten years after the first settlers landed, and
died while on a visit to Adelaide, in 1850.]</p>
<p>In the face of many difficulties&mdash;such as lack of water
near at hand, tent-life in an inclement winter, salt beef and
pork as the only meat obtainable, the proximity of convicts and
whalers, apprehensive imaginations, and uncertainty as to the
site of the chief town&mdash;a pleasant picture is given by a
visitor to the island shortly after the first colonists landed.
"Before us," he says, "were the hills, on the slope of which lies
the town 'Kingscote'. These hills are covered entirely with wood,
having, from the sea, the appearance of an impenetrable jungle,
with here and there a group of dead trees rearing their gaunt and
withered limbs above their fellows. A little patch had been
cleared at the slope of one of these hills, and there stood a
solitary white cottage, the property of Mr. Samuel Stephens. On
the brow of the hill, looking down a steep precipice into the
sea, were some half-dozen wooden huts of former immigrants. On
the beach was the skeleton of a storehouse then under erection,
around which were four or five huts built of bushes; in one of
them they were performing Divine service, the summons to attend
which was given by means of a bell hung up in a tree."</p>
<p>This is a pleasant picture, but, unfortunately, it was soon
found that the settlement on Kangaroo Island was a mistake.
Flinders, it will be remembered, had given a flourishing account
of it as an eligible site for a settlement, and this had been
confirmed in much stronger terms by one Captain Sutherland, who
visited the island in 1819. He described the land and timber as
excellent, and intimated his intention of settling there when the
colony was founded. Flinders spoke chiefly of the number of
kangaroos and other animals he found, and his account of the
prodigious number of pelicans on a lagoon of the island inspired
James Montgomery's imaginative poem, "The Pelican Island".
Sutherland, on the other hand, described in glowing terms the
interior, the fertility of the soil, and its beautiful tracts of
level ground. As a matter of fact, it was little better than a
desert island, deficient of every resource, except abundance of
salt, and in every respect unsuitable for settlement, and
incapable of repaying the South Australian Company for its outlay
of money. But early lessons had to be learnt by experience, and
the Company, influenced by the favourable reports they had
received, could hardly be held responsible for the mistake of
placing their first colonists on this wretched island. Moreover,
they had other motives. At Kangaroo Island was the only port of
the new province where there were any European settlers; the
eastern shore of the Gulf of St. Vincent, which afterwards became
the great centre of population, was practically unknown. In
addition to this it was imperative that the first settlers should
have a means of livelihood, and the island had long been known as
an eligible station for the whale-fishery, a branch of industry
which the Company intended to largely develop.</p>
<p>It was, however, soon to be demonstrated that with the
mainland before them, almost boundless in extent, and rich in
every kind of natural wealth, it was a fatal error for the
settlers to remain on Kangaroo Island.</p>
<p>On the 20th of August the brig <i>Rapid</i>, with Colonel
Light and the survey staff on board&mdash;including Lieutenant
Field, R.N., Mr. J.S. Pullen (afterwards vice-admiral), Messrs.
W. Hill, Wm. Jacob, and G. Claughton, surveyors; Dr. Woodforde,
and Mr. Alfred Baker, mate&mdash;arrived at Nepean Bay. The
colonel was no ordinary man, and his life had been full of
romantic adventure. He was of mixed race&mdash;half European,
half Malay&mdash;and was born in 1784, at Malacca. His mother was
the daughter of King Quedah, sovereign of the Malacca territory.
Young Light was brought up in England, entered the navy and
afterwards the military service as a cavalry officer, and served
in the Peninsular War as lieutenant of the 4th Light Dragoons. He
was an excellent linguist, and in the Intelligence Department of
the army rendered important service to Lord Wellesley by his
thorough knowledge of French and Spanish. Some of his remarkable
adventures are recorded in Napier's "Peninsular "War". He left
the army soon after the battle of Waterloo, and married the
daughter of the Duke of Richmond. He next accompanied Sir Robert
Wilton to Spain to aid in the Spanish revolutionary war, and
received the rank of colonel in the Spanish forces. Later on he
accepted service in the navy of the Pasha of Egypt, where he
became acquainted with Captain Hindmarsh, Governor-Elect of South
Australia.</p>
<p>After examining the South Australian Company's settlement at
Kingscote, and satisfying himself that it was an impossible place
for colonization, Colonel Light proceeded to a bay which he named
Rapid Bay, after his brig, and thence to St. Vincent's Gulf,
landing occasionally to ascertain the nature of the coast.
Several days were spent in fruitless search for the li arbour,
said to have been visited by Captain Jones. He could not identify
it, however, but found one which he considered would be valuable
at a future time. After exploring the gulf he returned to Rapid
Bay, where he was met by Mr. (afterwards Sir) John Morphett and
Mr. Samuel Stephens, who brought the news that the <i>Cygnet</i>
had arrived in Nepean Bay. The <i>Rapid</i> was at once sent
thither to bring over the assistant-surveyors.</p>
<p>The <i>Cygnet</i> had brought over eighty-four passengers,
namely, fifteen cabin and sixty-nine steerage. Mr. (afterwards
Sir) G.S. Kingston, deputy-surveyor, was in command of the
division of the survey party brought out in this vessel, and
among others on board were Mr. B.T. Finniss, assistant-surveyor;
Captain Lipson, R.N., harbour-master; Mr. Edward Wright, surgeon;
and Messrs. Morphett and Powys, unattached. According to
instructions, the passengers and stores were landed at Kingscote
Harbour, but after hearing from Colonel Light that Kangaroo
Island was totally unfit for colonization, they were reshipped,
and the <i>Cygnet</i> proceeded up the gulf and anchored in
Holdfast Bay. Here the passengers and stores were landed, and the
tents pitched on the beach near the creek. One of the first cases
unpacked contained twenty-four muskets, which were distributed,
and a watch set to guard against a sudden attack by the natives,
whose encampment was known to be at no great distance. The
precautions were unnecessary, as the natives were very shy, and
did not venture to approach the new-comers, until Mr. W. Williams
went to their encampment, and induced one of them to return with
him to the settlement, where the man remained for four days, and
then suddenly disappeared to tell his tribe of the wonders he had
seen, and to bring them back with him to behold some of the
novelties of civilization. A friendly feeling thus sprung up
between the sable children of the forest and the new-comers.</p>
<p>The camp of the first settlers at Holdfast Bay, viewed as the
nucleus of a nation, was novel and interesting. The dwellings,
like those on Kangaroo Island, were frail, tents predominating,
but interspersed with huts constructed of reeds, bark, and
branches of trees. Boxes and trunks served for tables and chairs.
As there were neither vehicles nor animals, all wood had to be
carried, and water conveyed on skids, or sledges; cooking
operations were carried on in the open air, the triangle with
hook and chain, the three-legged pot and camp-oven, the hook-pot
and frying-pan being the utensils most in use.</p>
<p>There was work for everybody to do in providing the
necessaries of life&mdash;baking, cooking, hunting, and fishing.
Daily discoveries were made of fresh phases in the features and
character of the country and its singular inhabitants, and, in
the absence of any newspaper, every one took up his parable and
told of exploits in killing kangaroos, emus, opossums, snakes,
lizards, wild dogs, or other animals and reptiles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Colonel Light was making important explorations and
examinations of the plains on the eastern side of the gulf. On
the 4th of October he wrote&mdash;</p>
<p>"I cannot express my delight at seeing no bounds to a flat of
fine rich-looking country, with an abundance of fresh-water
lagoons, which, if dry in summer, convinced me that we need not
dig a deep well to gain a sufficient supply. The little river,
too, was deep, and it struck me that much might hereafter be made
of this little stream." On the 5th Messrs. Claughton and Jacob
were sent on shore to trace the river up, if they could, until
they found fresh water in it. On their return they reported that
the river was fresh about four miles from the mouth, and that it
was then a narrow stream bearing to the north-east, and appeared
to have its source in the plains. "A circumstance," wrote Colonel
Light, "that led me to suppose that more of these lagoons existed
in that direction, and as every appearance indicated that these
lagoons would be dry in summer, I felt convinced that the
torrents from the mountains would be the fountain from whence
they were now filled. My previous observations at sea, before I
saw this country, were, that all the-vapours from the prevalent
south-westerly winds would rest on the mountains here, and that
we should, if we could locate this side the gulf, be never in
dread of those droughts so often experienced on the eastern coast
of Australia. And I was now fully persuaded by the evidence here
shown, as well as the repeated collection of clouds, and by rain
falling on the hills even at this season of the year."</p>
<p>Such were the observations made, and the impressions formed by
Colonel Light on visiting for the first time the arm of the sea,
or salt-water creek, which was destined to become the principal
harbour of South Australia. In his further examinations along the
coast, can be traced, from his journals, visits to what are now
known as Torrens River, the Reedbeds, Holdfast Bay, the creek at
Glenelg with the little river Sturt flowing into it, and so
on.</p>
<p>A highly favourable opinion of the locality was impressed on
his mind, and, although he had not yet fixed upon any part of it
as the site for the capital, his examination of other localities
confirmed him in the opinion that the land-locked creek he had
entered on the eastern side of the gulf was the best harbour in
the most suitable locality of any he had seen.</p>
<p>Early in November the <i>Africaine</i>, commanded by Captain
Duff, and having on board, amongst others, Mr. Gouger, the
colonial secretary; Mr. Brown, emigration agent; and Mr. Thomas,
printer of the <i>Gazette and Register</i>, arrived off Kangaroo
Island. Deceived by the glowing language of Captain Sutherland in
his description of the island, six of the passengers landed on
its western side, with the intention of proceeding overland to
the new settlement. They took with them two days' provisions, but
soon found that the dense underwood made their progress slower
than they had expected. With hatchets they chopped their way
through scrub and bush, until, becoming exhausted, they made for
the beach, hoping to reach the settlement by the sea-coast. But
here their course was checked by the heavy surf beating against
the high cliffs, and again they were compelled to force their way
through the bush. For the first three clays they found fresh
water, but not a drop afterwards, and on one occasion they had to
quench their thirst with the blood of sea-gulls. After being out
for nine days, four of the party, in an exhausted state, reached
Nepean Bay, but the other two (Dr. Slater and Mr. Osborne), being
unable to keep up with their companions, perished in the
bush.</p>
<p>On finding that Colonel Light had ordered all the surveying
party and stores away from Nepean Bay, the <i>Africaine</i>
proceeded forthwith to Rapid Bay, where the colonel happened to
be on her arrival. He went on board, and was at once besieged
with inquiries.</p>
<p>"Mr. Gouger was, of course, very anxious to know where we
should settle&mdash;a question I was by no means prepared to
answer; and the only thing I could do was to recommend his
proceeding to Holdfast Bay for the present. This was not at all
satisfactory, every one in such circumstances being anxious not
to move again after landing all his embarked property. I could
only recommend this place as one from which they were the least
likely to re-embark, but stating strongly, at the same time, that
I could not guarantee permanent settlement there. To make the
best of a doubtful case, both Mr. Gouger and Mr. Brown agreed to
take their chance, and Captain Duff having very kindly offered me
a passage, I embarked on the 7th of November."</p>
<p>Next day the <i>Africaine</i> arrived at Holdfast Bay, where
the <i>Rapid</i> was lying at anchor, and, in company with
Captain Duff, Mr. Gouger, and Mr. Brown, Colonel Light set forth
to examine, and, if possible, ascertain the mouth of the river
Yatala, afterwards called the Torrens, which had been discovered
by Messrs. Field, Kingston, and Morphett. But the river was found
to exhaust itself in the lagoons afterwards known as the
Reedbeds. As they were returning to their ships they observed the
<i>Cygnet</i> standing in for the bay, and soon after it blew a
gale of wind. Referring to this, the colonel wrote in his
journal, "It is impossible to describe my feelings on this
occasion, seeing three English vessels on a lee shore, riding
safely at the roadstead."</p>
<p>Many difficulties were in the way of Colonel Light at this
time. Scurvy was breaking out among the new-comers from long
abstinence from fresh food, and he had to enter into arrangements
with Captain Duff to proceed to Hobart Town for a supply of fresh
provisions; there were no proper appliances for penetrating into
the interior with stores and baggage, and he had to write full
and urgent letters to the Commissioners for vehicles and
animals.</p>
<p>After more vain searching for Jones' harbour * (which was
probably identical with Captain Barker's "sixteen mile creek"
seen under a different aspect), Colonel Light again visited the
localities on the eastern coast of Gulf St. Vincent, and became
more and more confirmed in his opinion as to this being the most
eligible site for the capital. Nevertheless, as the letter of his
instructions bound him to look at other places before he finally
fixed upon a locality, although, as he said, he felt assured he
should only be losing time, he proceeded on the 25th of November
down the gulf, and after touching at Rapid and Nepean Bays,
sailed for Port Lincoln. In a report to the Commissioners, he
wrote&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* From relying on the exaggerated report of
Captain Jones, Colonel Light twice turned his back upon what was
ultimately adopted as Port Adelaide.]</p>
<p>"I am decidedly of opinion that Port Lincoln is no harbour for
merchant-ships; looking at it as a port for men-of-war, well
manned, plenty of boats, etc., it is very well. It is capacious,
and there is excellent holding ground, but the strong gusts of
wind shifting all round the compass render the entrance not
altogether so safe as the plan of it on paper would indicate."
Later on he added&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have been considering much of this gulf (Spencer's), and I
think it best to give it up entirely for the present, for should
there be a good harbour, and good soil higher up, yet the dangers
that surround the entrance are too many for a new colony."</p>
<p>These were wise and sagacious words, and, as we shall see, it
would have been well had they been accepted without question. On
the 17th of December, Colonel Light returned from his visit to
Port Lincoln and the western side of Spencer's Gulf. He
wrote&mdash;</p>
<p>"The time now lost in much extra labour, and the arrival of
many people from England, makes me anxious to find some place to
locate the land purchasers and others, and from every answer to
my inquiries of the sealers, as well as the practical view of the
coast I had to the westward, I felt convinced I should not find
anything more eligible than the neighbourhood of Holdfast Bay."
And so, on the 24th of December, the colonel returned to Holdfast
Bay, and went on shore for the purpose of examining the river,
and, if possible, of fixing the actual site of the capital.</p>
<p>The crowning moments of excitement in the life of the settlers
were when tidings came of a sail in sight, or the arrival of an
English vessel, and many were the visits paid to the highest
sandhill in the hope of descrying a visitor. Especially was this
the case when the arrival of the Governor was anticipated, and
his non-arrival at the expected date greatly increased the
excitement.</p>
<p>It is reported that, one Sunday morning, when Mr. Kingston was
reading prayers with Mr. T. Gilbert for his clerk, a whisper went
round that an English vessel was in sight. Those nearest the door
began to quietly move out, followed by others, until at last the
officiating minister was left alone with his assistant, when the
former threw down the book, saying, "Come, Gilbert, it's no use
our staying here," and the two went forth to join the throng.</p>
<p>On the same day that Colonel Light returned to Holdfast Bay,
H.M.S. <i>Buffalo</i>, with the Governor, Captain Hindmarsh, and
the Resident Commissioner, Mr. J. Hurtle Fisher, on board,
entered the magnificent harbour of Port Lincoln, and found the
<i>Cygnet</i> at anchor in Spalding Cove. Here Captain Lipson,
R.N., the harbour-master, came on board, and presented a letter
from Colonel Light, announcing that the most desirable site for
the capital was to be found on the eastern side of Gulf St.
Vincent.</p>
<p>The Governor landed at the head of Spalding Cove, and was
greatly impressed with the scenery and general aspect of Port
Lincoln. As, however, it was known that the officers of the
Government who had preceded him were anxiously awaiting his
arrival on the plains near Mount Lofty, he could not linger in
that earthly paradise, and set sail without delay.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the 28th the little band of pioneers
at Holdfast Bay were gladdened by the sight of the <i>Buffalo</i>
and the <i>Cygnet</i> standing across the gulf, and coming to
anchor in the roadstead. At two o'clock the excitement
culminated, when Captain Hindmarsh and his family, attended by
Mr. J.H. Fisher, Mr. Stevenson, Mr. Osmond Gilles, and the Rev.
C.B. Howard, with their families, proceeded to the shore in three
boats, escorted by a party of marines from the
<i>Buffalo</i>.</p>
<p>They were received and cordially welcomed by the settlers on
the Glenelg plains, headed by Messrs. Gouger (colonial
secretary). Brown (emigration agent), Gilbert (storekeeper),
Kingston (deputy-surveyor), John Morphett, and Robert
Thomas,&mdash;men who were destined to have their names indelibly
associated with the annals of the colony.</p>
<p>The Company, or at least all the officials, assembled in Mr.
Gouger's hut, when the Governor read aloud the Orders in Council
erecting South Australia into a British province, and appointing
the colonial officers. The commission of Captain Hindmarsh as
Governor and Commander-in-Chief was then read, and the customary
oaths were administered to the Governor, members of council, and
other officers present.</p>
<p>But Mr. Gouger's tent was only constructed to hold about a
dozen persons, and at least two hundred, nearly the entire
population, were present. Therefore, as only a very few had heard
what was passing in the tent, Mr. George Stevenson, the
Governor's private secretary, clerk of the council, and embryo
editor of the <i>South Australian Gazette</i>, assembled the
people under the shade of an old gum tree, which still remains,
though in a state of decay, and read aloud the proclamation
establishing South Australia the only free British province of
New Holland. The official account of the proceedings, as given in
the <i>South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register</i> of June
3, 1837, was as follows: "The commission was afterwards read to
the settlers, of whom about two hundred were present. The British
Hag was displayed under a royal salute. The marines fired a
<i>feu de joie</i>, and the <i>Buffalo</i> saluted the Governor
with fifteen guns. A cold collation, provided for the occasion,
was laid out in the open air, of which the party partook."</p>
<p>In less stately language, by the same writer, the scene is
thus described: "A dozen or so of drunken marines of H.M.S.
<i>Buffalo</i> discharged several muskets in honour of the
occasion; a table manufactured impromptu out of boards supported
on barrels, salt beef, salt pork, and an indifferent ham, a few
bottles of porter and ale, and about the same quantity of port
and sherry from the crypts of the <i>Buffalo</i>, completed the
official banquet which graced the advent of British rule to the
shores of South Australia. In the evening kind and hospitable
hands&mdash;alas! now no more&mdash;prepared the grateful herb. .
. ." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** The following is from the diary of Mrs.
Robert Thomas:&mdash;"<i>December</i> 28th, 1836.&mdash;This was
a proud and I hope will prove a happy day for South Australia.
Early in the morning it was announced that the <i>Buffalo</i> had
arrived from Port Lincoln, accompanied by the <i>Cygnet</i>,
which had gone thither to escort the Governor to Holdfast Bay.
This made us all alive; and soon after Mr. Thomas received notice
to attend at the tent of Mr. Gouger, the colonial secretary,
where his Excellency the Governor was expected to be at three
o'clock to read his commission and proclaim the colony. Mr.
Thomas then went to the Company's store, and soon returned with a
request that he would procure a ham, as Mr. Gilbert was not
provided with one, which was done, and a fine Hampshire ham was
dressed for the occasion. It was also requested that we should
prepare ourselves to meet the procession, as all who could were
expected to attend. We went accordingly, and found the largest
company assembled we had yet seen in the colony&mdash;perhaps two
hundred persons. The Governor's private secretary read the
proclamation under a large gum tree, and a party of marines from
the <i>Buffalo</i> fired a <i>feu de joie</i>, and loud hurrahs
succeeded. A cold collation followed in the open air, of which we
partook. The Governor was very affable, shaking hands with the
colonists, and congratulating them on having such a fine country.
After the repast he mounted on a chair, and gave the first toast,
'The King', which was received with three times three, and
followed by the National Anthem, led by Mr. Gilles; but the old
royal appellation of George is so natural to Englishmen after
four successive reigns of kings of that name, that it was
forgotten at the moment we have now a William on the throne, and
the first line was sung as formerly&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot" align="center">'God save great George, our
king',</p>
<p class="foot">which excited a smile, and yet I believe that
William IV. has not more loyal subjects throughout his wide
dominions than those who were there assembled to welcome the
arrival of the first Governor of South Australia. The health of
his Excellency was then proposed and drank with loud and
universal cheering, followed by 'Rule Britannia'. Then 'Mrs.
Hindmarsh and the ladies', proposed by Mr. Gilbert, which also
received great applause, as did several other toasts. The
Governor then gave the following: 'May the present unanimity
continue as long as South Australia exists', which made the plain
ring with acclamations; and at about five o'clock his Excellency
and lady departed to the ship, and some officers and others
followed in another boat. They all seemed highly delighted with
our village, as I may call it, consisting now of about forty
tents and huts, though scattered about without any regularity, as
every family fixed their present abode wherever they pleased,
knowing it would not be of long duration. We took coffee in Mr.
Kingston's hut, and returned home about seven. The evening, as
well as the day and the preceding one, was very hot, and the
night continued so, insomuch that it was impossible to sleep, the
thermometer having been sometimes upwards of 100&deg; in the
tent, and it seemed that some of the colonists did not even go to
bed, for we heard singing and shouting from different parties at
intervals till long after daylight. And here I may remark that,
from the exceeding stillness of the night, except when the wind
disturbs the trees near us, we can distinctly hear almost every
sound that occurs, though at a considerable distance."]</p>
<p>So ended an ever-memorable day in the history of the colony.
It was the day of small things, although no one would have so
regarded it on reading the enthusiastic literature of the time.
The <i>South Australian Record</i>, a monthly journal published
in London, broke forth into singing the praises of the event in
these amusing terms&mdash;</p>
<p>"The landing of the little band in their new country recalls
the awful emigration of Noah, and the promise that painted his
horizon, and that of Moses. It reminds us of the Tyrians at
Carthage; of &AElig;neas and the dominion of the West, which
tradition tells us was founded by him; of the stout-hearted
Britons who built up the great, though still young, nations of
America, and, nearer to the present scene, the colonies of
Australia, whose errors of constitutions have served as an
impressive lesson, while their unexampled prosperity points to
the commercial fortune of the newer settlement."</p>
<p>Apart from all bathos, it was a day long to be remembered. A
band of brave-hearted men and women had staked their fortunes,
left home and friends and country, and journeyed to the antipodes
to settle in a land almost uninhabited, unsurveyed, with no town
laid out, nor even the site of the intended capital selected.*
And amongst the number assembled that day on the Glenelg plains
were men who were to be the "Makers" of the new colony&mdash;men
who were to bear the burden and heat of the day, and by their
toil, judgment, and persistence lay the foundations of healthy,
political, social, and religious life in one of the finest lands
on which the sun ever shone.</p>
<p class="foot">[* During the year 1836 fifteen vessels arrived
from England, bringing nearly a thousand men, women, and
children, a large number of whom settled in the first instance at
Kangaroo Island.]</p>
<p>It is no wonder that to the present day thousands of people go
forth on the 28th of December to the old gum tree at Glenelg to
celebrate Foundation Day, or, as it is generally termed,
"Proclamation Day".</p>

<p>E<small>XCELLENT</small> as the speeches were on the day of
proclamation, and harmonious as everything seemed to be, it was
unfortunately the fact that the relations between the Governor
and the Resident Commissioner were strained, the difficulties
between them being as to the exercise of the powers entrusted to
each. The breach, commenced on shipboard, soon widened on shore,
and resulted in the formation of a Governor's party and a
Commissioner's party, greatly to the hindrance of the general
welfare.</p>
<p>Matters were further complicated by grievous dissensions with
Colonel Light, the surveyor-general, regarding the proposed site
of the principal settlement. The selection was left solely to
him, and this duty he was not only authorized but required to
discharge, the Commissioners purposely avoiding all minute
instructions, and desiring that he would consider himself at
liberty to deviate even from the more general instructions given,
if, in the discharge of his duty, new facts should arise which,
in his opinion, justified so strong a measure. Should, however,
the Governor arrive sufficiently early in the colony. Colonel
Light was instructed to confer with him on the subject, and pay
due regard to his opinions and suggestions, but he was warned
against yielding to any influence which could have the effect of
diverting him in any way from the sole responsibility of the
decision.</p>
<p>On the 30th of December the Governor went with Colonel Light
to inspect the proposed site for the capital, and, in common with
many others at that time, expressed dissatisfaction, his ground
of objection being that it was too far from the harbour. The
colonel, therefore, sought a site not so far out; but as there
were evident marks of the river overflowing its banks on the
place fixed upon by the Governor, Colonel Light resolved to go
back to the first site. "My instructions from the Commissioners
were peremptory as to the responsibility of this choice devolving
upon myself," he wrote; "for although I was allowed to pay
respect to the Governor's opinion, yet my own judgment on this
point was to be paramount and conclusive." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** The following letter from Captain Hindmarsh
to Mr. G.F. Angas is not without interest:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot" align="right">"H.M.S. <i>Buffalo</i>, at anchor
off Glenelg Plains,      <br>
"January 5, 1837.   </p>
<p class="foot">"<small>MY DEAR SIR</small>,<br>
<br>
     "We reached Port Lincoln on the 24th ult., where, according
to my expectation, I found Captain Lipson waiting for me with a
letter from Colonel Light, informing me that he had found a good
harbour and plenty of excellent land on the eastern side of Gulf
St. Vincent. I immediately proceeded to join him, hi doing which
I was two nights and two days in beating out of Spencer's Gulf,
which I entered without any fear. I should, however, be very
sorry to try the same navigation again until that very dangerous
gulf is surveyed. Flinders' survey is good as far as it goes; but
his own track is the only thing to be depended upon. Gulf St.
Vincent, on the contrary, appears to be perfectly clear, with
regular soundings and good anchorage all over it, not one danger
having yet been discovered. Each sandy beach, however, seems to
have a small reef running off it, according to Colonel Light's
report. I am now at anchor off the Mount Lofty of Flinders, about
three miles from the shore, in seven fathom. Most of the people
who preceded me are located temporarily on the plains abreast of
the ship, which I have named after Lord Glenelg, and which for
quality and beauty are well worthy to bear his lordship's
name.<br>
<br>
"Adelaide is to be on the bank of a beautiful stream, with
thousands of acres of the richest land I ever saw. Altogether a
more beautiful spot can hardly be imagined. . . ."]</p>
<p>Having definitely made up his mind, he spent several days in
looking over the ground, and mentally laying it out according to
the course of the river and the nature of the surroundings.</p>
<p>The site selected is in latitude 34&deg; 57" south, and
comprises a southern and northern elevation, with a small valley
and river between them. The northern rise is the spur of a low
range of hills, of limestone formation, and the southern
elevation is a piece of table-land which, at the time the first
settlers arrived, was tolerably well wooded.</p>
<p>The country all along that part of the coast presented a most
attractive aspect, resembling English park scenery. The land
required little clearing, and was fit for immediate occupation
for tillage or sheep-runs, well watered, and covered with
luxuriant grass. The ground sloped backwards for several miles
from the coast, terminating in the Mount Lofty range, behind
which lay Lake Alexandrina and the country of the Murray. So many
combined advantages decided Colonel Light in fixing upon this
spot as the site of the principal settlement, but it was hardly
to be expected that it should include every requisite, and still
less that it should answer all the expectations of the colonists.
One fancied drawback was that it was six miles from the port, and
some urged that the first settlement should be close to it. But
at the port there was no fresh water, and Colonel Light had no
hesitation in deciding that it was better to be obliged to carry
all necessary commodities from the port to the town, than to
convey all the water required for culinary and other purposes
from the town to the port; and his wisdom and sagacity were soon
justified.</p>
<p>There were others who still clamoured for the first town to be
located in the neighbourhood of Encounter Bay, one of the chief
advocates of this situation being the judge, Sir John Jeffcott.
But Colonel Light would not yield to this suggestion for a
moment; he was satisfied that even if a good harbour could be
found, the tremendous rollers at the entrance of the bay would
render it comparatively useless. And a tragic confirmation of his
wisdom was soon to be given; one or two wrecks occurred in the
dangerous neighbourhood, and Sir John Jeffcott and Captain
Blinkinsopp, in attempting to prove that they were justified in
their opposition, lost their lives by the upsetting of their boat
in the turbulent waters.</p>
<p>Having selected the site. Colonel Light was instructed in
laying it out to make the streets of ample width, arranging them
with a due regard to convenience, salubrity, and beauty, and to
make the necessary reserves for squares, public walks, and open
spaces. Ten acres were to be reserved as a Government domain, and
two hundred acres to be appropriated for a public park and
gardens. He was also directed to reserve as a public road all
land on the coast within a hundred feet of high-water mark, and a
road sixty-six feet wide on each side of every navigable
river.</p>
<p>No sooner had he commenced his task than he was subjected to a
series of interferences from the Governor, his private secretary,
and others in different spheres of authority; and, being of a
sensitive nature, he was hurt that reflections were made in high
quarters on his judgment and ability. Nor were matters much
mended when a public meeting of the landowners and others
concerned was called by the colonial secretary, at the command of
the Governor, to discuss the proposed site of the capital, a wish
having been expressed by many to stay any definite action being
taken until all the coast had been surveyed.</p>
<p>At the meeting a resolution was submitted, "That it is the
opinion of this meeting that the site at present selected for the
chief town of the colony, being at a considerable distance from
navigable waters, is not such as they were led to expect would be
chosen." Considerable discussion followed, but happily an
amendment was proposed: "That this meeting considers that in the
site selected by the surveyor-general for the first town, he has
secured in a most satisfactory manner those advantages which the
Commissioners and the first purchasers in England contemplated as
essential, namely, a central point in the province, in the
neighbourhood of a safe and improvable harbour, abundance of
fresh water on the spot, and of good land and pasturage in its
vicinity, with a probable easy communication with the Murray,
Lake Alexandrina, and the most fertile parts of New South Wales,
without fear of any injury to the principles of the colony from
too near an approach to the confines of the convict settlement."
The voting was, for the amendment, 218; for the original motion,
137: giving a majority of 81 in favour of the amendment.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, the Governor was not satisfied. He had
come to the colony with the impression that the capital should be
somewhere in the locality of Encounter Bay, and he was
injudicious enough to appeal to the Commissioners for the removal
of the capital to that neighbourhood, and at the same time to
give strong expressions of complaint against Colonel Light, who
had only exercised the powers made binding upon him.</p>
<p>The answer received by Captain Hindmarsh was, that "when he
applied for the office of Governor he was distinctly informed
that the right of selecting the capital would be vested solely in
the surveyor-general," and that when he pressed the Board to cede
this right to him, he was "seeking for an extension of power
inconsistent with the principle of the colony; and that a
Governor of South Australia must be content to receive and to
hold his appointment subject to the condition of non-interference
with the officer appointed to execute the surveys, and to dispose
of the public land." This was a judicious snub, but it had no
abiding effect.</p>
<p>The survey and staking off of the town acres was commenced by
Colonel Light and his assistants on the 11th of January, and was
completed on the 10th of March.</p>
<p>On the 23rd of March, the method of drawing by lot having been
fixed upon, and the plan of the town mapped out and exhibited for
public inspection, those preliminary purchasers who had deposited
money for land in England to enable the colony to be founded,
made their selections. A few days afterwards the remaining acres
were sold by auction. Then came the first land boom, when those
acres which had cost from &pound;2 2<i>s</i>. to &pound;14
14<i>s</i>. each at auction, and those first selected at
12<i>s</i>., were selling at from &pound;80 to &pound;100 each,
and for those considered to be well situated as much as
&pound;250 was demanded, resulting, as most land booms do, in
disappointment to the majority, and in the witnessing of the
resale, some four or five years afterwards, at prices not
reaching more than one-fifth of those rates.</p>
<p>On the 28th of March permission was given to the public "to
cut down and grub up trees in the public streets, except those
within sixteen feet of the frontage of private property."</p>
<p>The naming of the streets and squares did not take place until
the 23rd of May, and it was the occasion of a renewal of those
bickerings and misunderstandings that had gone on from the first.
Divided authority was the bane of every movement, and of course
the Governor and the Resident Commissioner both claimed the right
of naming localities and places as well as Colonel Light, the
surveyor-general. Eventually the matter was settled by a
combination of "authorities" and landed proprietors, and the
names of those connected with the early history of the colony
were handed down to posterity in the streets, squares, and
terraces of Adelaide.</p>
<p>Fortunately there was no dispute, and could be none, as to the
name of the capital. King William IV. having requested, before
the first ships left England, that it should be called after his
royal consort, Queen Adelaide.</p>
<p>Soon after the site was definitely settled, the emigrants who
had been holding on at Kangaroo Island and elsewhere removed to
the "city", in the hope that they would soon be able to take up
their country sections. But in this they were disappointed, and
many complications ensued. Amongst them was the question of food.
Before the arrival of the Governor, when one of the most pressing
wants of the colonists was a supply of fresh provisions, Colonel
Light despatched the <i>Cygnet</i> to Van Diemen's Land for eight
hundred sheep; but, in consequence of boisterous weather on the
return journey, very few remained alive when the vessel reached
Kangaroo Island. Then the matter was taken up by the Governor and
council, and a sum of &pound;5000 was voted for the purchase of
flour, horses, bullocks, waggons, barges, etc., and a committee
appointed to select and purchase the same. While in Sydney for
this purpose, Messrs. Barnard and Fisher, two of the committee,
made inquiries as to the practicability of conveying stock
overland, when one Mr. Robert Clint offered, for the sum of
&pound;10,000, to convey to a given point 2000 young ewes in
lamb, 300 mixed cattle, 30 horses, mares, and geldings, and 24
true-bred sheepdogs. The offer was not accepted, but, as we shall
see, the transit of cattle overland soon became an accomplished
fact. Meanwhile the vessels chartered by the Commissioners
continued to bring in supplies of live stock from the Cape of
Good Hope and elsewhere.</p>
<p>After completing the town surveys, Colonel Light directed his
attention to the country lands, but his work was carried on under
great difficulties. A spirit of disaffection was abroad; owing to
the lack of means for transporting goods, rations often ran low;
and the survey vehicles were diverted from their proper use to
convey the luggage of new-comers from Holdfast Bay to Adelaide.
The lack of fresh water at the harbour was a great drawback to
progress. As an instance of the cost of conveying it to the bay,
it may be mentioned that the <i>Buffalo</i> had twenty tons of
water conveyed from Adelaide to Glenelg, the charge for which was
&pound;100, and nearly half this amount for bringing back the
empty water-casks.</p>
<p>Alluding to his men, who were called "two-shilling-a-day
slaves", Colonel Light wrote, "Their complaints had much truth.
They had signed in England for twelve shillings a week and
rations, the same in quality as allowed in his Majesty's navy,
and they were sometimes many days with hardly anything but
biscuit, sometimes not that. Had there been no difficulty with
the men, we could not have detached a party from the town, as not
a single working bullock could be had. The tents were all in use
by the immigrants as well as by the surveying parties. The
rations which came up from Holdfast Bay in small quantities were
delivered almost immediately, not only to those entitled to them
by agreement, but also to the immigrants, who had no other means
of sustenance than from the Commissioners' stores, and the
remaining part of the twelve months' stores purchased in England
for the use of the survey alone were now shared out to all.
Humanity required this, but the consequence was a cessation of
work, and an apparent neglect of duty on the part of the
surveyor-general, for which, of course, there were many quite
ready to abuse him."</p>
<p>When the stores were better supplied, surveying recommenced
under more favourable circumstances, and a party was formed under
Mr. Finniss to commence on the western side of Adelaide, with the
Torrens on the right, the range of hills to the left, and the sea
in front, while Colonel Light began on the right bank of the
river. Still the work was hindered by occasional strikes among
the men and by bad weather. "During this period," wrote Colonel
Light, "I began to feel a very evident change in my health,
which, with anxieties of mind, wore me down very much, and I was
obliged to neglect many days' working in consequence."</p>
<p>To the unavoidable delay in the progress of the country
surveys may be mainly ascribed the overwhelming difficulties and
disasters in the first years of the history of the colony; and,
next to this, the error of the Commissioners in permitting
emigration to take place to the extent it did before the country
land was ready for selection. By the 25th of May, 1837, not quite
a year after the arrival of the first vessel at Kangaroo Island,
sixteen vessels from England had landed upwards of a thousand
emigrants, and twenty-five vessels had left Sydney and Van
Diemen's Land with supplies of provisions and merchandise,
besides conveying many settlers. In November of the same year the
population was estimated at 2500. All these people flocked to the
city because, although they held land orders, they could not get
possession, and therefore could not enter upon their proper
business pursuits, or upon any productive labour. As a
consequence there came a state of stagnation. The very implements
required for agriculture and the utensils for dairy work soon
crowded the auction-rooms, and were sold at absurdly low prices,
that the vendors might support themselves on the proceeds. "The
majority of the settlers were without income, and had to live
upon their capital and by the sale of their town acres. Rents
being very high, employment was given to artisans at extravagant
wages to erect buildings in the city; but as houses soon
increased and rents diminished, those who had embarked their
capital in buildings had cause to regret making such
investments." Provisions were imported at ruinous prices; hard
cash intended to be used in "making a fortune" was squandered in
idleness; and labourers were employed upon works premature, if
not unnecessary, for the mere sake of giving them employment.</p>
<p>The Government was largely dependent upon what it could make,
and the principal source of its revenue, for emigration purposes
only, was the sale of land, but the sales had not yet commenced;
the duties upon spirits and wine licences yielded so small a sum
that the Governor had not sufficient money to pay even the
salaries of its officers. There were no other revenues. The Land
Fund was sacred; the English Government could not he asked for
money; the Colonial Treasury existed only in name.</p>
<p>On the 25th of May, 1837, the Governor, after much contention
with the Resident Commissioner on the subject, proclaimed the
harbour a legal port, but for some time afterwards it was not
much used. At this early date there was neither wharf, pier, nor
jetty at either Holdfast Bay or the harbour, and considerable
damage and loss was sustained in consequence. At the bay heavily
laden boats were sometimes in danger of being swamped, and if the
water was smooth they could not approach near enough to the shore
for the goods to be landed dry without great care. As soon as
vehicles were obtained, the bullocks or horses were driven into
the water as near as possible to the boats, but even then a
submerging of the package or case in course of removal was no
uncommon thing. A tradition of those days records that, among
other casualties, Mrs. Hindmarsh, soon after her arrival, had the
mortification of seeing her piano floating ashore at Glenelg.</p>
<p>One of the first public works undertaken at the port at the
head of the creek was the cutting of a small canal to enable
lighters to discharge their cargoes on <i>terra firma</i>. The
silt and mud excavated formed a bank above the reach of ordinary
tides, and upon this bank the goods landed were piled until
removed by carts or drays to their destination.* The cost of this
little canal, which would receive some six or eight barges, was
about &pound;800.</p>
<p class="foot">[* There were for the first few months so few
vehicles, oxen, and horses, that it was a long time before the
colonists could get their belongings together, and sledges,
skids, wheelbarrows, and other impromptu devices were in
requisition to convey luggage from the landing-place to
Adelaide.]</p>
<p>The arrival of large numbers of immigrants rendered a
dep&ocirc;t for their immediate accommodation necessary, and a
site was selected on a part of the western parklands, and wooden
buildings, known as "Immigration Square", were erected. In one
part of the square there was an infirmary and dispensary, and
adjacent thereto the office of the immigration agent&mdash;a
functionary who had by no means an easy time during the first few
years of the colony's existence.</p>
<p>Up to the end of 1839 nearly all the large vessels arriving
from England came to anchor in Holdfast Bay, and here, therefore,
the immigrants were landed. Many were the strange and exciting
scenes enacted there. In the absence of jetty or wharfs,
passengers, luggage, and merchandise had to be landed in the surf
on the beach, unless the bullock-drivers could persuade their
teams to go sufficiently near to the boats to obviate this
necessity. As a matter of course, the greater number of persons
landed had either to be carried ashore, or to wade through the
water. Soon the beach would be thronged with the wondering and
inquiring new-comers; a number of bullock teams stood about
waiting to convey the women, children, and luggage to the town;
and here and there a group of natives would welcome the visitors
with strange grimaces and modest appeals for "biccity", "'bacca",
or "black money". Then the procession would move off, bound for
Immigration Square.</p>
<p>The city presented a strange appearance in the early days. The
temporary dwellings of the settlers who had removed from Glenelg
were strewn about the valley, or lined the banks of the river,
presenting the appearance of a large gipsy encampment. Some of
the "buildings" were composed of mud and grass, others of
brushwood, and some of wooden frames covered with canvas. One of
the first residences close to the town was "the Vice-regal
Mansion", as it was jokingly called&mdash;a building remarkable
for its want of pretension to either elegance or comfort. It was
built by the sailors of the <i>Buffalo</i> ** and consisted of
three rooms, the walls being of mud and the roof of thatch.
Unfortunately, "Jack" forgot to put in a chimney, which caused
many a joke at his expense. Of stone and brick houses there were,
of course, very few in the first instance, and these few were
erected at great expense. But soon a building mania set in;
temporary erections gave "way to proper houses, and almost within
a year of its foundation Adelaide began to assume the
characteristics of an established town. Unfortunately, it became
the great centre of attraction, and, in addition to the mania for
substantial buildings there, many were building castles in the
air, instead of turning their attention to flocks and herds, the
growth of grain and garden produce, and the development of the
natural resources of the colony.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The marines of the <i>Buffalo</i> were left
as a sort of body-guard to the Governor. But they were not a very
sober or reliable set. Mr. Osmond Gilles used to tell a story of
one of them who was left to act as guard over the
Treasury&mdash;at that time only a tent in which was a safe, In's
own private property, lent to the Government. Returning; home
late one night, he passed the tent and found the guard helplessly
intoxicated, his general impression being that ho was on board
the <i>Buffalo</i>. The treasurer dealt with him gently. "The
truth is," he said, "as there was only one shilling and sixpence
in the safe, a guard might have been spared." At that time the
Government was completely aground as to cash, and remained so
until the treasurer, from his private purse, brought a
supply.]</p>
<p>It was some time before the ordinary machinery of society got
into proper working order, but the first year of the existence of
the colony witnessed many interesting events and enterprises,
important as being the foundations upon which great things were
to be built in the future. It will be well in this place to see
what attempts were made to evolve order out of chaos; and we will
first glance at some of the early operations of the South
Australian Company. The Company, as we have shown, was the means
of planting the colony. We have now to inquire how far it
succeeded in fulfilling its further design to make the prosperity
of the colonists possible. It will be remembered that the Company
undertook to build and buy ships, to establish whaling fisheries
and stations, to enter into agricultural and stock farming, to
embark in pastoral pursuits, to lease land to farming tenants,
and assist them to cultivate their holdings by advancing funds.
It was pledged to build wharfs and storehouses, shops and houses;
to buy and sell produce and manufactured goods; to work mines and
quarries, flour and saw mills, and generally to open up all the
possible avenues to prosperity.</p>
<p>On the 22nd of November, 1836, in a letter to Governor
Hindmarsh, Mr. Angas mentions the departure of Mr. McLaren, chief
commercial manager; Mr. Mildred, master ship-builder; Dr.
Drescher, overseer of the Germans; Mr. Shepherdson,
superintendent schoolmaster; Mr. Germein, master of the
trawl-fishing vessel; Mr. Wright, master of the white fisheries;
two vine-dressers; one flax-grower from Germany; with their
respective families, and others in the Company's service.</p>
<p>Besides the officers already mentioned, Messrs. W. Giles, C.S.
Hare, W. Prescott, W.B. Randell, and E. Stephens were among the
first engaged in various departments of the Company's colonial
service. To Mr. McLaren the directors committed the entire
management of the banks, shipping, fisheries, ship-building, and
commercial affairs of the Company, while Mr. S. Stephens had the
entire charge of the agricultural department.</p>
<p>The letters of instructions furnished by Mr. Angas, the
chairman of the Company, to Messrs. McLaren and Stephens, are
models of what such documents should be&mdash;clear, graphic,
explicit, and as complete and comprehensive as if the
establishment of the infant settlement had been entrusted solely
to the South Australian Company. Nothing conducive to the
progress and well-being of the colony was overlooked.</p>
<p>It was patent from the first that a banking establishment
would be an imperative necessity, and the prospectus of the South
Australian Company stated, as one of its objects, "the
establishment of a bank or banks in or connected with the new
colony of South Australia, making loans on land or produce in the
colony, and the conducting of such banking operations as the
directors may think expedient." But it was equally clear that it
should not form a branch of a commercial company, and therefore,
with great wisdom and forethought, it was omitted from the
original plan submitted by Mr. Angas to intending shareholders.
Negotiations were then opened up with the Bank of Australasia,
but they fell through; and as applications were being received by
persons wishing to proceed to the colony to transmit their money,
the original &pound;50 shares in the Company were divided into
two of &pound;25 each, and additional shares were issued at a
premium to afford sufficient capital for the commencement of a
bank or banks in the colony.</p>
<p>Accordingly, a supply of specie and small notes was sent out
in one of the first vessels despatched by the Company; and the
entire plant of the bank, together with a framed banking-house,
iron chests, and so forth, were forwarded by the ship
<i>Coromandel</i>, in charge of Mr. Edward Stephens as cashier
and accountant. This vessel arrived in South Australia on the
12th of January, 1837, a few days after the colony had been
proclaimed a British province, and in March the bank commenced
operations. The notes, which were engraved in London, varied in
value from ten shillings to ten pounds, and represented in the
aggregate &pound;10,000.</p>
<p>In a letter of instructions, drawn up by Mr. Angas, Mr.
Stephens was advised that the bank was to be one of issue,
discount, deposit, and loan, and that it would also undertake the
collection of debts and receipt of moneys by commission; give in
exchange for the notes of the bank, bills on England, and open up
a system of exchange between the colony and the mother country.
Besides the ordinary business of a bank, it was also practically
a savings bank, the smallest deposits, when they reached
&pound;1, bearing interest at 5 per cent. Loans were also to be
advanced on the security of property at moderate rates of
interest, although, when the mania for speculation in town lands
took place shortly after the colony was established, the Company
gave no encouragement to the proceeding, either in disposing of
their own property or in making advances to private
individuals.</p>
<p>To the early settlers, however, these loans were a great boon,
and enabled them to commence farming operations and pastoral
pursuits which they could not have done without such assistance;
while a place of security for their savings was also a
desideratum in those days of tents and mud cottages. As soon as
capitalists arrived, these subsidiary operations of the bank
ceased.</p>
<p>For the first three or four years the rate of discount charged
on bills having three months to run was 10 per cent., and 12 per
cent. for those of longer periods. Interest at 4 per cent. was
allowed on the daily balance of current accounts, and 7 per cent.
on cash deposited.</p>
<p>The bank at once became a medium of exchange between Great
Britain and the colony, and in course of time secured agencies at
Sydney, Hobart Town, Launceston, Canton, Calcutta, Bombay,
Madras, Ceylon, Mauritius, Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena, and
Hamburg.</p>
<p>It was foreseen from the first that the Government would need
the aid of the bank, and the directors intimated to their agent
that, as the Governor had only taken out &pound;1000 in specie,
both he and the Resident Commissioner might require assistance,
in which case it was to be given within reasonable limits. Events
soon justified that anticipation. On one occasion, during the
administration of Governor Hindmarsh, the bank advanced the sum
of &pound;5000 when there were no funds whatever in hand. An
important arrangement was made with the Commissioners that the
notes of the bank should be received in payment for land, and for
any taxes to be levied for the support of the Government.</p>
<p>All these facilities for transacting monetary affairs should
have been, and, as a matter of fact, were, of great benefit to
the early colonists; but, unfortunately, owing to the open
hostility between the Governor's party and the Resident
Commissioner's party, neither the Company nor its bank were
regarded with favour by the authorities in the colony.
Nevertheless the bank outlived this petty opposition, and became
a permanent and useful institution. From the first it more than
justified its existence. During the first year of its operations
moneys were lodged at the London office of the Company for
repayment in South Australia amounting to upwards of
&pound;15,000, while the drafts drawn on England in the colony
amounted to nearly &pound;7000. In 1840 the business of the bank
had increased to nearly a quarter of a million, and was yielding
a profit to the Company of 15 per cent.; but as it was an
obstacle in the way of the Company in its efforts to obtain a
charter of incorporation, it was in the following year
transferred from the Company and established upon an independent
footing as "The South Australian Banking Company". Mr. McLaren,
the general manager of the South Australian Company, on his
return to England in 1841, stated to the shareholders, "I do not
hesitate to say that the progress of the colony, and the success
of individual colonists, has been more owing to the Bank of South
Australia than to any other cause whatever&mdash;perhaps I might
say, than to all other causes put together."</p>
<br>
<p>The total quantity of land possessed by the Company in the
first instance was 102 town acres, 13,770 country acres, and 330
acres for the first settlement at Kangaroo Island. At the sale of
town land in March, 1837, sixty-six acres more were purchased in
the "city", making a total of 168 town acres, including six at
the port.</p>
<p>Pastoral pursuits were among the first labours entered into by
the Company in the colony. Pure merino rams and ewes, selected
with great care and at much expense in Saxony, were early sent
out, as well as some pure Leicesters and South Down sheep and
Cashmere goats. Later on choice stock of various kinds were sent
out by the Board in London to improve the breeds in the colony.
The number of prizes awarded from time to time to the exhibitors
of the Company's live stock was evidence of the value of the
importations.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* In May, 1851, the Company relinquished its
pastoral pursuits altogether, and disposed of the whole of its
flocks and herds.]</p>
<p>In horticulture the Company introduced the vine, Zante
currant, olive and other fruits, but beyond establishing the fact
that the soil and climate were suitable for their growth and
culture, and the formation of a small nursery, no attempt was
made to enter into competition with the settlers in the
production of fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>The fishery operations of the Company were on an extensive
scale, and embraced the sperm, black, and off-shore
whale-fisheries, besides white fishing for home consumption,
salting, and exportation. Five of the Company's vessels were
employed in this industry; off-shore stations were established at
Encounter Bay and Thistle Island, the former soon after the
landing of the first settlers, and the latter at an early period
of the Company's existence.</p>
<p>The loss of the <em>South Australian</em> and the stranding of
the <i>John Pirie</i> in Encounter Bay, and also the loss of
three other vessels engaged in this service, led to the
relinquishing of what had once been a profitable pursuit. Some of
the produce of the Company's fisheries constituted the first
export from the colony to the mother country, and as early as the
26th of December, 1836 (two days before the colony was
proclaimed), the Company's manager shipped at Kingscote for
exportation to Van Diemen's Land three barrels of salted fish,
containing 1359 mullets and 605 lbs. of skipjacks. The trade did
not, however, prove profitable, and was soon abandoned.</p>
<p>One of the largest and most beneficial of the early
undertakings of the Company was the laying out and opening up of
the New Port, as it was called; the erection of wharfs and
warehouses, and the construction of a good road across the swamp
to connect the port with the city. The road was formed at a cost
of about &pound;13,000, and soon after its completion the Company
took in exchange an equivalent in land of the Government at the
upset price, so that the road might become available for public
purposes. This spirited undertaking greatly enhanced the value of
the Company's property, and was also of incalculable benefit to
the young colony.</p>
<p>The Company in its early days was largely engaged in the
erection of buildings; but these operations, like many others,
were relinquished in course of time, the idea of the founder
being that the Company might be compared to a scaffolding,
needful to the erection of a large building, but to be taken down
when the building is completed.</p>
<p>In the early days the Company held a prominent place in the
estimation of the first settlers, who were indebted to its
various establishments for much of their supplies; hence the
"Company's Stores", the "Company's Cattle Station", the
"Company's Ship Station", the "Company's Dairy", the "Company's
Steam Flour Mills", the "Company's Buildings", the "Company's
Wharf", and the "Company's Bank", were familiar as household
words. Many of the Company's servants became most useful
colonists, and attained to wealth and influence.</p>
<p>Enough has been shown here to prove that all the operations of
the Company were favourable to the advancement of the colony; in
fact, but for its large capital&mdash;vastly beyond any other
available for similar objects&mdash;employed judiciously in
giving remunerative occupation to the people, and in developing
the resources of the country, there would have been a dead-lock
at the outset. Unfortunately little unity of action characterized
the proceedings of the Commissioners and the Company, and if
these two bodies could have worked together more harmoniously,
beneficial results would even more speedily have followed, and
some serious evils would have been averted. The Company was too
energetic and expeditious in its movements for the Commissioners,
and they, in turn, were too much so for the Colonial Office, and
consequently none acted in concert.</p>
<br>
<p>Having glanced thus far at the operations of the South
Australian Company, we must turn again to the early settlers, and
the administration of the first Governor.</p>
<p>The history of the rise and progress of religious institutions
in South Australia is of exceptional interest. One of the main
points for which the early friends and founders of the colony
contended was that there should be no dominant Church; that no
provision should be made by the State for the promotion of
religion, but that the voluntary principle should be put fairly
to the test. Nevertheless, there crept into the South Australian
Act of 1834 a clause giving power to persons appointed by the
Privy Council to appoint chaplains and clergymen of the
Established Churches of England and Scotland, and under this Act
the first colonial chaplain, the Rev. C.B. Howard, was appointed
by Lord Glenelg, on the recommendation of the Bishop of Chester.
A strong protest was made by the "founders" against the
appointment, not on personal grounds, but as being an evasion of
the non-establishment principle; and in the amended Act, passed
shortly afterwards, the clauses relating to such appointments
were omitted.</p>
<p>Mr. Howard arrived in the <i>Buffalo</i> with the Governor and
other Government officers, and being anxious to commence work at
once, religious services were held under a huge sail, borrowed
from a captain in port, until a temporary building could be
erected. To get the sail from the port, some miles away, was a
"labour" of love, and it is on record that the worthy clergyman,
assisted by Mr. Osmond Gilles, the colonial treasurer,
accomplished the task by drawing it on a truck with ropes over
their shoulders along the dusty track in blazing hot weather.</p>
<p>Better accommodation was, however, in store for the
worshippers. An association had been formed in England, in
connection with the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, to
assist the colonists in providing for themselves the means of
public worship and religious instruction, and, subscriptions
amounting to over &pound;800 having been collected, a wooden
church, capable of accommodating 350 persons, and provided with
communion plate and books, was sent out in frame, together with a
parsonage house. It was soon found that the wooden church did not
answer the purpose, and it was determined to erect a stone
structure. Mr. Pascoe St. Leger Grenfell, having offered a town
acre for the erection of a church and parsonage house, acre No.
9, at the corner of Morphett Street and North Terrace, was
selected, and on the 26th of January, 1838, the foundation-stone
of "the Church of the Holy Trinity" was laid by the Governor.</p>
<p>Shortly after Mr. Howard's arrival, it was rumoured that the
Bishop of Sydney regarded the new province as a part of his
diocese, and had appointed the colonial chaplain as his surrogate
for granting marriage licences, and examining the certificates of
clergymen. This gave rise to the first religious dissension in
the colony; but it was found that the bishop and the colonial
chaplain, without any wish to violate the provisions of the South
Australian Act, had been under a misapprehension, as the Act
distinctly stipulated that South Australia should not be subject
to any law passed for any other part of Australia, and
consequently the letters patent of the Bishop of Sydney could
have no force in Adelaide. A frank explanation settled the little
storm, but a watchful eye was kept for a time upon the movements
of the Church party. It was soon found, however, that Mr. Howard
was a warm-hearted catholic man, whose one object in life was to
do good, and he succeeded in winning the confidence and
affections of the colonists of all classes and creeds.</p>
<p>South Australia having been designed as a "Paradise for
Nonconformists", the various religious denominations were soon
well represented. The Wesleyans were among the first in the
field, and early in 1837 a few individuals set to work to provide
funds for a chapel and schools. Through the liberality of Mr. E.
Stephens and others, a neat brick building was soon erected in
Hindley Street, at the back of the South Australian Bank, and
here Mr. D. McLaren, manager of the South Australian Company,
conducted service in the morning, and other laymen in the
afternoon and evening. But in course of time they felt the need
of a regular minister, and early in 1838 one was sent to them in
a singular fashion.</p>
<p>The Rev. William Longbottom, Wesleyan minister, sailing in the
<i>Fanny</i> with his wife and child from Tasmania to fill a
vacancy in Western Australia, fell in with a gale which increased
in fury, until at midnight the vessel struck on an unknown coast,
and they were landed through the surf by means of a rope. They
suffered for want of a fire, till on the second day of their
escape some friendly natives ventured near them. After a
fortnight spent in a forlorn condition, and not knowing whither
to turn, a crew of shipwrecked mariners found them. By means of a
chart they had saved they had travelled a hundred miles, and were
going fifty more in search of a whaling station. The two
companies made common cause, and for forty-five days they
wandered through the bush, and, reaching the station, they were
taken by sea to Adelaide, where the pastorless society of sixty
members welcomed the minister, and would not let him go. He lost
all his worldly possessions by the disaster, but a subscription
was set on foot to recoup him for some of his losses. He soon
commenced his ministrations among the people, and carried them on
with such success, that he may be regarded as the founder of
Wesleyan Methodism in South Australia.</p>
<p>The first minister of the Congregationalists&mdash;a body
destined to play a very important part in the political as well
as in the religious history of the colony&mdash;was the Rev.
Thomas Quentin Stow, for several years pastor of an Independent
chapel at Halstead, Essex. He was selected for the colony by the
Colonial Missionary Society, whose attention had from the outset
been directed to the new settlement, with its peculiar
constitution in regard to religion, as an important sphere of
labour for Independents. Until, however, the infant settlement
was in a position to maintain Mr. Stow, the London Missionary
Society agreed to grant him &pound;100 per annum, and Mr. George
Fife Angas made himself responsible for his outfit and other
expenses.</p>
<p>In a letter to friends in the old country, Mr. Stow thus
describes his early labours in the colony:&mdash;</p>
<p>"March, 1838. . . . I am pleased to say the clergyman is
evangelical and active. The Methodists, too, I rejoice to add,
have a society and are doing good. I have been kindly received by
all persons, and hope, by God's grace, to be enabled to do
something here. Mr. Giles is at Kangaroo Island, where he
preaches, and where his services are much needed.</p>
<p>"Mr. McLaren is sometimes there and sometimes here; he is a
Baptist, manager for the Company, and is said to be an excellent
preacher. I am gathering a congregation, though, of course, not
very fast. Our Church has been formed about two months,
consisting of thirteen members and two candidates. We have also
begun a Sunday school, which promises well. The Governor and most
of the officials have been to hear me. It is well you, allowed us
a tent, for no house was to be had. I determined, therefore, to
build on the same acre where my house stands (a most eligible
spot for worship) a temporary place of gum-wood posts, pine
rafters, and reed thatch, and the walls, at present, of old
sail-cloth canvas. The size is forty feet by twenty, besides a
schoolroom at one end fourteen feet by twelve, and can be opened
into the main building in half an hour, if called for, thus
giving us a building of more than fifty feet in length. To pay
for this I sell the tent. It is a good edifice of its kind, and
is reported to be the best thatched place in the colony. It was
done by two Halstead men of my Church there. I worked regularly
with them, felling the pines, cutting the reeds miles from the
town, thatching, etc. . . ."</p>
<p>The first Baptist Church in the colony was under the care of
Mr. D. McLaren, the members belonging to various sections of the
Baptist body. They met at first for worship in the School
Society's building in the park-lands, but after a time they
removed to a chapel in Hindley Street, vacated by the
Wesleyans.</p>
<p>In course of time other religious communities came upon the
scene, until scarcely a section of any denomination remained
unrepresented.</p>
<p>In those early days of which we now write, comparatively
little was done with regard to education, although Mr. George
Fife Angas, as representing the South Australian Company, had
from the first made it a leading consideration. It will not be
uninteresting to "set in order" the story of the introduction of
schools into the new colony.</p>
<p>Among the earliest settlers was a man whose main object in
life was, strange to say, not to make money, but to assist in
forming the new community on a moral and religious basis. This
was Captain Bromley, who for nearly a quarter of a century had
been the unsalaried agent of the British and Foreign Bible and
School Societies, and had in 1813 established the first British
School in British North America. He was living on his little
freehold property in Boston, Lincolnshire, when he heard of the
South Australian enterprise, and foreseeing a field for his own
peculiar benevolent, and to a great extent self-sacrificing,
labour, he was among the first to depart for the new settlement.
In December, 1836, he commenced his work on Kangaroo Island, and
the following is the first educational report from South
Australia:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I collected," he says, in a letter home, "all the children I
possibly could, but the whole number only amounted to
twenty-four, and nearly half of these were infants; they were,
therefore, taught on the infant-school system, and all except
one, a mere babe, could either spell or read before I came away.
While thus employed I could hardly obtain money enough to
purchase bread and cheese, the weekly pay of the children not
amounting to more than ten shillings, so that, instead of
building a hut, I was obliged to buy common necessaries to live
upon. I had, therefore, no alternative but to teach the children
under the shade of a large and beautiful tree, which would have
accommodated forty or fifty more." Captain Bromley afterwards
contrived to erect a hut with his own hands, so that, "when a
change of weather drove them from the tree, he was able to
shelter his little flock from the rain." He left the island for
the mainland in May, 1837, when he was appointed Protector of
Aborigines, and in May of the following year was accidentally
drowned in the river Torrens.</p>
<p>Such is the history of the first school and schoolmaster in
South Australia.</p>
<p>Long before Captain Bromley went to the colony, however, Mr.
G.F. Angas had elaborated an educational system for the new
settlement, and had established in England "The South Australian
School Society", to create and sustain an interest in education
in that colony. Mr. J.B. Shepherdson was selected to make himself
acquainted with the best school systems in operation in the
mother country, and at the end of 1830 he set sail for South
Australia with strong recommendations to the Governor, and backed
by sufficient voluntary contributions to make a good start.</p>
<p>In April, 1838, the school-house, a wooden building in the
park-lands nearly opposite Trinity Church, was opened for the
reception of children over five years of age. The school
continued under the management of Mr. Shepherdson until July,
1840, when he resigned the appointment.</p>
<p>The cause of education was greatly indebted to the ministers
of the various places of worship, who, in addition to organizing
Sunday schools, night classes, and so forth, undertook in some
instances to teach the higher branches of learning. It should be
remembered that all these powerful influences for good were being
exercised at a time when, in the early history of several other
colonies, the thoughts of the settlers were almost exclusively
engrossed in matters far other than those of a religious and
educational character.</p>
<p>Nor was the welfare of the aborigines overlooked. In the Act
of 1834 South Australia was declared to consist of "waste and
unoccupied lands", thus failing to recognize the existence of the
aborigines. Further than this, the Act declared all the lands of
the province to be public lands open to purchase by "British
subjects", and thus excluding the natives from any possession in
or advantage arising from the land.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, from the outset of all negotiations for
colonizing South Australia, the Commissioners made special
provision for their welfare, while in the plans of the South
Australian Company the chairman invariably set the claims of the
natives, and the duty of the servants of the Company in regard to
them, in the forefront.</p>
<p>One of the earliest appointments made by the home Government
was that of a "Protector of aborigines", whose duty was to study
their interests generally, to see that no violence was done to
them by the colonists, that their grievances were, as far as
possible, redressed, and that food, shelter, medical treatment,
and education were afforded when necessary. Certain lands were
reserved for their use, but, as we shall see, the wild children
of the forest never took kindly to "eighty-acre sections".</p>
<p>We need not discuss here the many theories that have been put
forth as to their origin, or whether they were descended from a
higher or a lower race, but there seems little doubt that all the
aboriginal tribes of Australia originally belonged to one and the
same branch of the human family; the root of the language spoken
throughout the entire coast-line of the continent, the personal
appearance of the people, their rites and ceremonies, manners and
customs, all point to a common origin; and all are alike in
having neither legend nor tradition, scrip nor inscription as to
how, when, or whence they came. Like most other savages, the
Australian looks upon his wife as a slave. To her belongs the
duty of collecting and preparing the daily food, of making the
camp or hut for the night, of gathering and bringing in firewood,
and of procuring water. She must also attend to the children, and
in travelling carry all the movable property, and frequently the
weapons of her lord and master. In wet weather she attends to all
the outside work, while he is snugly seated at the fire. If there
is a scarcity of food, it is she who has to endure the pangs of
hunger in addition to ill-treatment and abuse.</p>
<p>The natives, although robust in appearance, do not possess
muscular strength in a proportionate degree. In expertness they
will successfully rival most white men, and even in the case of a
brief trial of strength; but they are no match for the white man
in long-continued hard labour. Six or eight days' consecutive
work generally taxes their endurance to the utmost limit.</p>
<p>When first known they appeared to have been free from any
hereditary diseases, and were comparatively free from those of an
epidemic character. In the treatment of their ailments they
resorted to sorcery or witchcraft.</p>
<p>In those days they had ample resources, according to the
localities they were in, for finding food, which consisted of
fish, indigenous vegetables, roots, birds, snakes, lizards,
luscious grubs, manna, honey, emu and other eggs, kangaroos,
opossums, wallabies, pelicans, swans, geese, ducks, and other
fowl. Their dress in their natural condition was very simple,
consisting of the skins of the opossum, kangaroo, or wallaby; or,
on the sea-coast, if these could not be procured, seaweed and
rushes were manufactured into garments. Their dwellings
consisted, in fine weather, of a few bushes laid one upon the
other in the form of a semicircle, as a protection to the head
from the wind, and in the winter of rough huts supported by
branches, or the protection of projecting or overhanging rocks,
caverns, or the hollows of large trees. They were, however,
almost always on the move, and their buildings were in
consequence of a very temporary character, intended only for a
few weeks' occupation at most.</p>
<p>In their domestic arrangements polygamy was practised to its
fullest extent, and wives were considered the absolute property
of their husbands. Little real affection existed between them,
and in innumerable instances women, children, and old people were
known to be treated with gross inhumanity, especially when
helpless and infirm. Few women were to be found free from
frightful scars upon the head, or marks of spear-wounds about the
body. Infanticide was very common, and was practised solely to
get rid of the trouble of rearing children, and to enable the
woman to follow her husband in his wanderings, which she
frequently could not do if encumbered with a child.</p>
<p>The natives had several superstitious ceremonies and customs
peculiar to themselves&mdash;varying in different
localities&mdash;relating to circumcision, marriage, death, and
burial; but their religious ideas were of the most meagre kind.
That they had a notion of immortality may be gathered from the
fact that they regarded Europeans as dead blacks resuscitated,
and who had changed colour in the process! They had a wholesome
dread of evil spirits, believed in sorcery and witchcraft, but
had no knowledge whatever of God, nor had they any special
objects of adoration or worship.</p>
<p>Dancing was one of their principal amusements, and throughout
the entire continent there were points of resemblance in the
manner of conducting the dances, such as the practice of painting
the body with white and red ochre, carrying boughs in their
hands, or tying them round their limbs, adorning the head with
feathers or down, beating time upon sticks or folded skins, and
in the dance representing the actions of animals, the
circumstances of the chase, of war or of love.</p>
<p>Their songs were of a very rude and unmeaning character,
consisting of endless repetitions of one or two meagre ideas. One
of the most fruitful sources of strife and warfare was the
meeting of different tribes, for however friendly they may have
been in the first instance, they rarely parted without a quarrel
or bloodshed.</p>
<p>Such, briefly, were the lords of the soil on whose territory
the all-conquering Europeans had come to live; and one of the
earliest questions the friends of the new colony had to consider
was how to civilize and Christianize the natives, and secure to
them the due observance of justice and the preservation of their
rights.</p>
<p>In the first report of the Commissioners, published in 1836,
the subject was made one of chief importance, and their
benevolent intentions with regard to the natives took this
form&mdash;to establish asylums for them, consisting of
weather-proof sheds, in which they might at all times obtain
gratuitous shelter and lodging; to train them in the use of
European eating and clothing, and in habits of useful industry as
assistants to the settlers.</p>
<p>An account of their first contact with "the higher
civilization", in the person of the representative of Majesty, is
given in letters written by Captain Hindmarsh to Mr. G.F. Angas,
from which we quote&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="right"><small>"February 15, 1837.</small>   </p>
<p>". . . Many natives have visited us, bringing with them their
women and children, and altogether exhibiting confidence that is
quite pleasing. Instead of being the ugly, stupid race the New
Hollanders are generally supposed to be, these are intelligent,
active, and handsome people, being far better looking than the
majority of Africans; not perhaps so good looking as the East
Indian, but an intermediate between the two. The women exhibit a
considerable degree of modesty. A party of about twenty, who came
down a few weeks ago, and who brought the first women and
children I had seen, were placed under the shade of a tree in
little family groups. When I first came up to them I soon became
well acquainted with their names, which were musical and pretty,
such as Alata, Ateon, Atare, and Melanie."</p>
<p>Later on in the same year he wrote&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="right"><small>"September 3, 1837.</small>   </p>
<p>"We have a very grave case now under our consideration. A
sailor left Encounter Bay a few weeks ago under the guidance of a
native and his two women. At about six miles from Encounter Bay
the native murdered the sailor for the sole purpose, it would
appear, of possessing himself of the poor man's bundle. The
murderer is now a prisoner on board the <i>South Australian</i>.
We have not yet decided how to proceed with him, but evidence is
being collected. It would, however, be worse than useless to
bring him before a jury unless there is almost a certainty of his
conviction. To release him under any circumstances (his tribe
knowing him to be guilty) would be naturally ascribed by the
natives to fear. We hardly know what evil this may lead to, as
they make a practice of taking the life of one of any tribe who
may have taken one of theirs, and this without regard to right or
wrong. I am sorry to tell you that from the examination of the
women, who have acquired a little English by living with the
whalers, murder appears not to be considered a crime, and does
not entail any disgrace, but only the retribution of the avenger
of blood, whose right to exercise his office is known, and once
exercised no more is thought about it. As to this prisoner, had
the whites knocked him on the head on discovering his guilt, I
believe his relatives would have considered it quite in the way
of business, and then thought no more about it. Not so, I fear,
should a regular process condemn him. And yet 'the bull must be
taken by the horns.' The colonists must be protected, and we must
do all that we can to show these poor people that justice is
equal between us.</p>
<p>"I have not yet been able to discover that these aborigines
have any notion of a Supreme Being, though it is clear they
believe in an evil spirit, who they consider the author of ill,
and who they fear, but do not worship. Indeed, we know but little
about their notions on this head. One fact, however, that
occurred the other day was interesting. A boy who had acquired a
little English was accused of having committed a theft. He denied
it very stoutly, and appealed for a confirmation of his denial to
his father and mother, both of whom are dead."</p>
<p>If the Governor was in doubt how he should deal with an
individual native, it is not to be wondered at that Mr. William
Wyatt, Protector of Aborigines, should find it difficult to deal
with all the tribes of the province, and his first report is
unwittingly amusing. After announcing that twelve huts in the
aborigines "location" were nearly ready for habitation, and that
rations of biscuit were distributed twice a day to whomsoever
might apply, the report proceeded&mdash;</p>
<p>"Many natives, especially children, are becoming acquainted
with a great number of English words"&mdash;it was proverbial
that they swore like troopers&mdash;"and are very eager to learn
the names of everything which attracts their attention. But their
general indifference to whatever is valued by civilized men,
whether it be clothing, the luxuries of food and comfortable
habitations, or the more worthy gratifications of the intellect,
makes it no easy matter to stimulate them to that degree of
industry necessary for acquiring such advantages; and the
salubrious climate of their native land predisposes very
considerably to this indolent condition of mind and body."</p>
<p>During the administration of Captain Hindmarsh, there were no
serious conflicts between the natives and the colonists, nor were
any really practical steps taken to educate the natives within
that period.</p>
<br>
<p>By the end of 1837 the population of the colony had reached
about 2500, and Adelaide boasted about fifty substantial
buildings and a hundred and fifty inferior houses or huts; the
rates of wages for mechanics and others had materially risen, and
there were signs of general prosperity.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mr. Morphett, in a letter home, written in
December of this year, says, "It is not a twelvemonth since the
governor proclaimed the province on the plains of Glenelg, and
very little more than that time since the first body of emigrants
landed on the beach at Holdfast Bay&mdash;the forlorn hope, as it
might be termed, of a large, wealthy, and intelligent community
of Englishmen, who had fixed upon this country as the scene of an
experiment in colonization. I recollect the disconcerted and
dismal look with which most of the party regarded from the deck
of the ship the dried and scorched appearance of the plains,
which to their English ideas betokened little short of
barrenness. . . . All this has given way to approval of the
place, confidence in the capabilities of the soil, and fitness of
the climate, with the most perfect satisfaction at the steps we
have taken, and a full confidence in the ultimate benefits that
"will be reaped by those who are pecuniarily interested in our
adventure. . . . The activity which prevails in business is
healthy and likely to last. Business in Adelaide has already been
systematized after the fashion of large towns in England. At
first the retail trade was in the hands of half a dozen
individuals, who both sold 'the staff of life' and prepared the
'trappings of woe'; now we have butchers, bakers, tailors,
shoemakers, dressmakers, and a variety of tradesmen, each class
following its own particular calling. There never was a colony
which, within the same time, had assumed one-tenth of the outward
signs of an independent community that this now does. Visitors
from the sister settlements in Australia are surprised at the
forward state of our town, at the evidence of capital which they
see, at the energy and spirit which prevail, at the amount and
character of stock, and at the comforts which most have collected
around them."]</p>
<p>The activity in town presented a striking contrast to the
little progress made in the country around, due in great measure
to delay in the surveys. Unfortunately, Colonel Light, instead of
having the assistance of the Governor, appears to have
experienced much harassing interference and interruption from
him. An appeal was made, therefore, to the Resident Commissioner
to expedite the surveys. Colonel Light having made known his
requirements, it was decided to report to the Commissioners, and
to send Mr. Kingston to procure additional assistance and
implements. He sailed in October, taking with him the first
exports from the colony to the mother country, consisting of oil
from the fisheries of the South Australian Company.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the settlers who could not obtain possession of
their lands were allowed the free use of the Glenelg plains,
where they pitched their tents, tended their Hocks and herds, and
made away with the dingo, or wild dog, for which the Government
offered a reward of five shillings per head for the male, and
seven and sixpence for the female; these prowling depredators
being most audacious in their attacks on sheep, poultry, and
other live stock.</p>
<p>When the first settlers landed on the Glenelg plains, grave
doubts were entertained as to the agricultural capabilities of
the soil. Only two experiments had as yet been made, one by Mr.
Meng&eacute; at Kangaroo Island, and the other by Captain Light's
survey party at Rapid Bay; and as the suburban and country
sections were not surveyed in 1837, the cultivation of the soil
was almost at a standstill. Under these circumstances an attempt
was made to raise a small crop of wheat on one of the South
Australian Company's acres on North Terrace, and although the
crop was not a heavy one, the yield was quite sufficient to
remove the general impression that the plains around the city
were unsuited to the growth of grain.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** Colonel Light never had any doubt on the
subject, and was wont to say to grumblers, "This country will not
only produce cereals, but all the products of Spain and
Portugal."]</p>
<p>During the year (1837) the settlers visited the neighbourhoods
of Hurtle, Morphett, and McLaren vales in the south, Mount Barker
in the east, and Lyndoch valley in the north-east and elsewhere,
and satisfied themselves that there were large tracts of land
admirably adapted for agricultural pursuits, although the most
sanguine never imagined that in the course of a few years South
Australian wheat would carry off the prize in the Great
Exhibition of the products of the world.</p>
<p>When the country lands were surveyed and allotted, the
settlers found, in commencing operations, that they had almost
everything to learn, for experience gained in the mother country
was of comparatively little use in the infant colony. The
climate, seasons, and soil were quite different; there were no
hedges or fences; oxen and horses were very scarce; provisions
and labour were exorbitantly high. The land first occupied, on
the Glenelg, Gilles, and Gawler plains, was but lightly timbered,
and as the greater part of it did not bear sufficient for
fencing, posts and rails had to be brought from a
distance&mdash;namely, from the "tiers", as the timbered hills
were called.</p>
<p>In this work the "splitters" from Van Diemen's Land rendered
good service until the labour market became stocked by new-comers
from Great Britain.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* More recently wire fences were very largely
used, horned cattle having become adepts at working out wooden
slip-panel rails with their horns&mdash;the patience,
perseverance, and ingenuity displayed in getting access to a
field of standing corn being truly surprising.]</p>
<p>After fencing his land and building his house or hut, the next
process was "clearing". If the wood could be sent into Adelaide
at a paying price, this was done; if not, the farmer would select
sufficient for his own wants and burn the rest. Then came the
grubbing of the stumps or roots, although those were often left
in the ground until the first crop had been raised. Many with
limited capital depended upon this crop for carrying on future
operations, and if it proved a failure, or gave but a small
return, they were thrown back for years. A "first crop" has
determined the whole future of many a colonist.</p>
<p>These small growers, who constituted the majority of the
agriculturists of the colony, were rarely freeholders in the
first instance; they leased a section for three or more years
with a right of purchase, the rental being so much per cent. per
annum on the purchase-money, or so much per acre according to
agreement. Every nerve was strained to become possessors of the
land; the strictest economy was practised; but if the first crop
failed, there followed, in many instances, the forfeiture of the
land through inability to carry out the terms of the agreement.
It was for some years a common practice for merchants and
storekeepers in Adelaide to supply these impecunious settlers
with provisions till harvest-time, when wheat would be taken in
exchange.</p>
<p>The fact that so many of these small growers succeeded and
became men of position in the colony, after commencing with
little capital and less experience, speaks well, not only for the
productiveness of the soil, but for their own indomitable energy
and perseverance.</p>
<p>A large proportion of those who were termed farmers became, as
a matter of fact. Only growers of wheat; instead of improving and
extending their homesteads, they aimed mainly at adding section
after section of land for wheat-growing purposes, without
devoting even a small plot to the production of fruit and
vegetables, which when planted recquire very little
attention.</p>
<p>The question of raising stock was one of absorbing interest,
and the first beginnings of pastoral pursuits deserve some notice
here.</p>
<p>In 1836 the arrivals of stock from England consisted of half a
dozen rams of the Merino and Leicester breeds, sent out by the
South Australian Company, two cows brought out by the
<i>Africaine</i>, and a few goats. With the exception of one cow,
these importations were landed at Kangaroo Island, the one cow
being taken to the mainland, where it was sold for fifty guineas,
and calved a few days afterwards. Her progeny, a bull calf, was
actually put to work within a twelvemonth afterwards, and earned
for its owner, Mr. F. Garden, thirteen pounds per week in drawing
water and building materials.</p>
<p>In the same year seventy sheep were brought over from Hobart
Town, where they had been purchased at twelve shillings per head;
a fine mare for the use of Mr. S. Stephens, first manager of the
Company; and a grey gelding, which was lost in what was then
called "the bush", the skeleton being found some three years
after in Coromandel Valley.</p>
<p>The locality first occupied by the imported stock was the
plains near Glenelg and around the embryo city of Adelaide. Here
the emu and the kangaroo gave place to flocks of sheep, while the
dingo, or wild dog, found himself "in clover", greatly to the
annoyance of the shepherd and to the loss of the importer or
owner. For a few years certain localities around Adelaide were
known as No. 1 Sheep Station, No. 2 Sheep Station, and so on; but
these were destined soon to become the sites of flourishing
suburban townships. In 1837 fresh arrivals of stock were landed
from Hobart Town, the Cape, and elsewhere, and it was soon found
that South Australia was eminently suitable for pastoral
pursuits. The promoters and founders of the colony gave the
subject of common pasturage early attention, and the
Commissioners afforded facilities to those desirous of engaging
in such pursuits, by providing for the occupation of land on
lease at the rate of ten shillings per square mile, two square
miles being allowed for each country section.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of April, 1838, Mr. Joseph Hawdon arrived at
Adelaide with a party of nine men, and announced the fact that he
had succeeded in bringing overland from New South Wales 325
bullocks, cows, heifers, and horses, all in good condition after
a journey of nearly one thousand miles, which had occupied about
ten weeks. The cattle were driven from their station on the Hume
to the Port Phillip mail establishment on the Goulburn, at which
place the drays from Port Phillip, carrying supplies for the
party, joined the expedition. The tracks of Major Mitchell, the
explorer, were next followed for some distance, and then,
descending the left bank of the Murrumbidgee and crossing the
Murray at the ford near its junction with the Darling, Mr. Hawdon
discovered a lake at the head of the Rufus, which he named
Victoria (after her Majesty), and another which he called Lake
Bonney, after his friend, Mr. C. Bonney. Four bullocks were
killed on the road by lightning, and many natives were seen, but
all were quite friendly.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawdon was the first to open up the overland communication
for stock; three months later, however Mr. E.J. Eyre, with three
hundred head of cattle, arrived in Adelaide, having made the
journey from New South Wales by an almost entirely different
route. He discovered a lake, and named it Lake Hindmarsh; on
leaving it he found no more fresh water, and was for three weeks
engaged in attempting to reach the Murray. At length, after many
adventures, he fell in with Mr. Hawdon's tracks, which he
followed.</p>
<p>A third overland party, under the command of Captain Sturt,
arrived in Adelaide in August, with four hundred head of stock.
Sturt had fallen in with the tracks of both Hawdon and Eyre, and
considered that Mr. Hawdon's route was the best that could be
taken. In this second visit to South Australia, Captain Sturt was
confirmed in his first impressions, and gave a glowing report of
the great pastoral capabilities of the country at the base of
Mount Barker, "far exceeding in richness", he says, "any portion
of New South Wales that I ever saw."</p>
<p>In addition to these overland arrivals of stock, large numbers
of sheep and cattle were sent by ship from Van Diemen's Land and
New South Wales. To further promote such importations, a "Joint
Stock Sheep and Cattle Company" was formed, with a capital of
&pound;20,000, and large purchases were made. In October, 1838,
it was estimated that there were in the colony 22,500 sheep and
lambs, 2175 head of cattle, and 233 horses.</p>
<br>
<p>We must now go back a little in the narrative to follow the
fortunes of "the dwellers in the city". Although in the very
early days of the colony those in authority might not always have
been very loyal to one another, there was never a period when
South Australia was not absolutely loyal to the throne.</p>
<p>In 1837 the birthday of King William IV. was celebrated by a
ball and a supper and other demonstrations, but within a few days
of these rejoicings the King had ceased to be, and the Princess
Victoria had acceded to the throne. On the 19th of October a
"Gazette Extraordinary" was issued, informing the colonists of
the fact, and on the day appointed the members of Council,
magistrates, officers of Government, and a number of the
principal inhabitants of the province assembled in front of
"Government House," when the Governor read the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Whereas it hath pleased Almighty God to call to His mercy our
late Sovereign Lord King William the Fourth of blessed and
glorious memory, by whose decease the Imperial Crown of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and all other his
late Majesty's dominions is solely and rightfully come to the
High and Mighty Princess Alexandrina Victoria, saving the right
of any issue of his late Majesty King William the Fourth which
may be born of his late Majesty's Consort, we, John Hindmarsh,
Knight of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order, Captain in her
Majesty's Royal Navy, Governor and Commander-in-chief of the
Province of South Australia, assisted by the Honourable Members
of Council of the said Province, the Magistrates, Officers of
Government, and numbers of the principal inhabitants of Adelaide,
therefore do now hereby, with our full voice and consent of
tongue and heart, publish and proclaim that the High and Mighty
Princess Alexandrina Victoria has now, by the death of our late
Sovereign of happy and glorious memory, become our only lawful
and rightful liege Sovereign Victoria, by the grace of God, Queen
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Defender of
the Faith, saving as aforesaid. Supreme Lady of her Majesty's
province of South Australia and its Dependencies, to whom, saving
as aforesaid, we do acknowledge all faith and constant obedience,
with all hearty and humble affection, beseeching God, by whom
kings and queens do reign, to bless the Royal Princess Victoria
with long and happy years to reign over us. God save the
Queen!"</p>
<p>Among the early Bills passed by the Council were the
following&mdash;"For establishing a Court of General or Quarter
and Petty Sessions; For fixing the qualification of jurors; For
the summary determination of disputes between masters and
servants; For granting licences for the sale of wine, beer, and
spirituous liquors; For the promotion of good order in
public-houses; For the establishment of a Court to be called "The
Supreme Court of the Province of South Australia".</p>
<p>The plan adopted for announcing any Bill about to be passed
was to issue a notice that "the said Bill could be inspected at
the office of the Colonial Secretary," and affixing such notice
to a tree opposite "Government Hut".</p>
<p>But this early legislation was not regarded with favour in
England, and only the last-named Act was permitted to occupy a
place in the statute-book of the colony. Meanwhile the young
community was to be governed by the laws of the mother country so
far as those laws would apply.</p>
<p>Although the early colonists in South Australia were probably
the most reputable that had ever gone forth as pioneers to a new
land, in the matter of crime the infant settlement was not
entirely free, and on the 13th of May seven prisoners were
brought before the "Court of General Gaol Delivery" for trial. In
addressing the grand jury the judge. Sir J.W. Jeffcott,
said&mdash;</p>
<p>"You are aware that in the neighbouring colonies it has been
considered inexpedient to concede the full right of trial by
jury. The reasons which have been considered as justifying such a
restriction elsewhere do not, however, happily prevail here; and
I feel no slight degree of satisfaction in being able to
congratulate the free inhabitants of South Australia, not on
being admitted to, but in being able to claim as their birthright
the full and unrestricted privileges of the British constitution
amongst which not the least valuable is that which has justly
been styled the palladium of English liberty, trial by jury, an
institution which, however it may have been occasionally abused
(and no human institution is free from imperfection), has been
proved by the experience of ages in our native land to have well
deserved that appellation. This valuable institution, in the
fullest sense of the term&mdash;that is. trial by the grand and
petit jury&mdash;will from this day&mdash;the first on which a
court is held in this province&mdash;be in operation, and I again
congratulate you on it."</p>
<p>In continuing his charge to the grand jury, Judge Jeffcott
said, "I am sorry to find that the vice of drunkenness,
notwithstanding the exertions of the Governor and the authorities
to check it, prevails here to an alarming extent. It must,
however, be checked amongst our own population, and if the tine
of &pound;2, which the colonial Act directs to be imposed upon
every man who is proved to be drunk, be not sufficient, other and
still more coercive means must be resorted to."</p>
<p>It was easy to talk of more coercive measures, but it would
have been very difficult to put them in force. Three months
earlier than the date of this charge, the Governor had written to
Mr. G.F. Angas&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="right"><small>"February 15, 1837.</small>   </p>
<p>"What I shall do without a small military force I do not know.
It is true I can institute a police force, but who am I to make
policemen? Those of sufficiently respectable character are able
to earn much higher wages than I dare offer, and I am restricted
in the salary to a police magistrate to &pound;100 a year. Where
shall I get a gentleman fit to do such duty who will give up his
time for so small a sum? I have suggested to Lord Glenelg that he
should allow me to make it &pound;200. . . ."</p>
<p>About this time, settlers as well as Government officials had
to employ banished men, ex-convicts, who were in many cases
skilful splitters, sawyers, fencers, and hut-builders. High wages
were paid to them, but it was considered undesirable to inquire
too closely whether they were "expirees" or "runaways". As the
Port was free and drink abundant, there was much disorderly
conduct at times. On one occasion a serious disturbance occurred,
and after the reading of the Riot Act the marines were ordered to
load and fire with ball cartridges, when some of the rioters were
wounded, and a few taken into custody. Not long after this the
Government store was broken into, and food, ammunition, and other
goods stolen; the hut of the sheriff, Mr. S. Smart, of Tasmania,
was attacked, and a pistol was fired at the sheriff. Volunteers
were at once sworn in as special constables, the delinquents were
captured, and a man named Magee, who fired the ball, was
hanged.</p>
<p>It is almost a matter of surprise that, with the bad example
set at this time by those in authority, there was not more
lawlessness among the people. The colonial secretary had
assaulted the colonial treasurer for violent language, and the
former was suspended. The emigration agent had been charged with
disobedience to the Governor's commands, and was suspended. One
official was charged with inciting the people to sedition, and
another with setting the judge at defiance, and so on.</p>
<p>As an illustration of the state of the times, an incident of a
visit to Kangaroo Island, made by the Governor in June, 1838, may
be recorded. While he was there a mail arrived, and the captain
of H.M.S. <i>Pelorus</i>, in which the Governor had voyaged, was
anxious to know if there were any despatches for him. Captain
Hindmarsh, in the presence of an officer, who for the nonce he
dubbed postmaster-general, opened the mail. At a meeting at
Adelaide, his action was very strongly condemned</p>
<p>Apropos of this, it may be stated that postal irregularities
were a source of very great trouble to the colonists at this
time, and the following curious advertisement in the <i>Sydney
Monitor</i> was intended to give a friendly hint as to where the
missing letters went:&mdash;"Post office in South Australia. The
Governor ought to be reminded that owners and masters of vessels
trading to new colonies are deeply interested in destroying all
letters between the new colony and the colonies they trade with,
and that until a judicious law regulating the mails between
Adelaide and these colonies be passed and regularly enforced,
letters and newspapers will continue to be purloined, as they
have hitherto been, and now are."</p>
<p>The dissensions in high places were soon to be aggravated by
the freedom of the press. The first number of the first <i>South
Australian</i> newspaper was published in London, on the 18th of
June, 1836, before the first vessel sent out had sighted the
shores of the new colony. The newspaper dealt more largely with
probabilities than certainties, but it was the wish of Messrs.
Robert Thomas and Co., the proprietors, and Mr. George Stevenson,
the editor, "to print the first number of the <i>South Australian
Gazette and Colonial Register</i> in the capital of the civilized
world, and the second number in a city of the wilderness," the
site of which was then unknown.</p>
<p>Printers, presses, type, and paper, identical with that used
in the first number, were shipped to South Australia, and on the
3rd of June, 1837, the second number was issued under many
difficulties, the printers and workmen engaged in England having
"bettered themselves" in other employments. Moreover, the
printing-office was only a tent. But by degrees all difficulties
were overcome, and the <i>Gazette and Register</i> occupied its
well-earned position.</p>
<p>The first colonial issue, however, was not well received by
all, nor indeed could it have been, for the dissensions and
disputes consequent upon the divided authority of the Governor
and the Resident Commissioner had, as we have said, led to the
formation of two parties, and as the <i>Gazette and Register</i>
stood by the Governor's party, it became necessary to establish
another newspaper, and the <i>Southern Australian</i>, edited by
Mr. Charles Mann, at that time advocate-general and Crown
solicitor, came into existence, as a party organ on the other
side. Official matters were sufficiently complicated before the
press asserted its liberty&mdash;they became more so when the two
newspapers took up their parables, and commenced wordy warfares
not infrequently in strong language, garnished-with
personalities.</p>
<p>While such was the state of affairs in South Australia,
matters at home were taking a serious turn for some of the
colonists. Reports unfavourable to the administrative conduct of
the Governor had reached the Commissioners from so many quarters,
that they were constrained to lay the matter before Lord Glenelg.
The principal complaints were that he had retarded the progress
of the surveys by interfering with the surveyor-general; that he
had assumed some of the powers delegated to the Resident
Commissioner; that he had incurred expenses without authority,
and that he had suspended and discharged a number of public
officers without sufficient cause. The letter addressed by the
Commissioners to Lord Glenelg concluded by stating that "however
much they might respect the rank of Captain Hindmarsh as a
distinguished officer of the British navy, they were compelled by
a paramount sense of duty respectfully to recommend, on the
several grounds which they had endeavoured to explain to his
lordship, that he might be immediately recalled from the
government of South Australia."</p>
<p>Pending a reply, several of the most influential friends of
the colony met in London to discuss the position, and a
deputation waited on the Secretary of State in reference to the
appointment of a new Governor.</p>
<p>The choice of the Commissioners fell upon Lieutenant-Colonel
Gawler, a distinguished officer under the Duke of Wellington in
the Peninsular campaign.</p>
<p>No sooner had the Commissioners completed their arrangements
with regard to the new Governor, than they received a series of
grave complaints against the Resident Commissioner, and somewhat
hastily they dismissed him from his office,* and having
experienced the evils of divided authority in the colony, the
Board submitted that henceforth the office of Resident
Commissioner should be merged in that of the Governor. In this
Lord Glenelg concurred, and later on Colonel Gawler was gazetted
Governor and Resident Commissioner.</p>
<p class="foot">[* It may here be stated that during the
administration of Captain Grey inquiries were instituted relative
to these charges, resulting in a complete exoneration of the
Resident Commissioner, communicated to him by Earl Grey,
Secretary of State for the Colonies.]</p>
<p>In June, 1838, the news reached the colony of the recall of
Captain Hindmarsh, and a large number of the colonists at once
presented him with an address expressing personal attachment, and
regretting his loss as "a colonist who had in so many instances
set a bright example of patient self-denial and energetic
exercise of manly accomplishments." In the course of his reply to
this address, Captain Hindmarsh read as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I receive your expressions of attachment in the same
sincerity of feeling with which I believe they are offered, and I
assure you that the regret I feel deeply at this moment is
influenced less by the political change to which you refer, or by
the reflection that such change has been effected by unworthy
means, than by the necessity I am under of leaving you for a time
to vindicate my public conduct and justify in England my
administration of the government of the province. The share which
a Governor of South Australia possesses in conducting the new
experiment in colonization is so small that under no circumstance
can he be justly responsible for its result. That responsibility
rests with the Colonization Commissioners, to whom the charge of
working out so peculiar a constitution is entrusted. The
principle, though novel, is simple, as I believe it to be sound.
Its successful practical application, however, depends, not on
the Colonial Government, but on the integrity and ability of the
individuals entrusted by the Colonial Commissioners with its
development, and it must be to a deficiency of those qualities
alone that anything approaching failure ought to be attributed. .
. ."</p>
<p>Captain Hindmarsh left the colony on the 14th of July, in
H.M.S. <i>Alligator</i>, for Sydney, intending to proceed from
thence to England. It was evident that he anticipated a return
after he had made his defence in England. Those most opposed to
his administration never doubted that to the best of his judgment
he had endeavoured to promote the welfare of the community, and
with this conviction he was confident that he could make a fair
representation of his proceedings at head-quarters. And there is
little doubt that if he had been so situated as to have been able
to act on his own responsibility and exercise an independent
judgment, he would have proved a much more successful
administrator of the affairs of the infant colony.</p>
<p>He was appointed Governor of Heligoland in 1840. In 1849 he
received the war medal and seven clasps, and other honorary
distinctions, for his long and distinguished services in the
navy. In 1851 the honour of knighthood was conferred upon him,
and in 1856 he returned to England, where he died, on the 29th of
July, 1860, at the advanced age of seventy-eight.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>INTERIM ADMINISTRATION OF MR. G.M.
STEPHENS.</small></p>
<p>Pending the arrival of the new Governor, the temporary
administration of affairs was undertaken by Mr. George Milner
Stephens, advocate-general, and son-in-law of Captain Hindmarsh.
His position was not enviable. In his first address to the
Council he drew this melancholy picture of affairs: "I have to
announce with regret that there are no funds in the treasury, and
that the quarter's salaries due to the whole of the public
servants on the 30th of June last are unpaid. We have, therefore,
to fear that the tempting remuneration held out for the exercise
of ability in private undertakings in this province, added to the
distress which they are beginning to experience from the want of
money, will induce many indispensable public officers to leave
the service of the Government. Secondly, by the departure of the
marines on H.M.S. <i>Alligator</i>, this province, with a
population exceeding four thousand persons, is abandoned to the
protection of eighteen policemen, lately embodied by Governor
Hindmarsh, while there are now twenty-one prisoners confined in
the weather-boarded building used as a gaol, and perhaps double
that number of desperate runaway convicts in the neighbourhood of
the town. At the same time, as I have observed, there are no
funds for the support of the force now constituting our only
protection, and the Resident Commissioner is restricted by his
instructions from providing money for such a purpose. . . . We
have happily no immediate cause to apprehend hostility from the
aborigines, or our situation would indeed be deplorable; but they
have ere now sacrificed two fellow-creatures, and you have too
recently witnessed the outrages that terminated in a public
execution, to regard with indifference our present unprotected
state. . . ."</p>
<p>The brief administration of Mr. G.M. Stephens as acting
Governor was a very successful one, inasmuch as he was the means
of arresting the progress of party spirit and of quelling much of
the strife that had unfortunately sprung up. From his private
funds he liberally relieved the treasury from its embarrassment
and effectually re-organized the police force.</p>
<p>It would be unfair to conclude this chapter without some
direct reference to the character, as a whole, of the colonists
who bore the burden and heat of the day at this important time
and in the more exciting times soon to follow, and we cannot do
better than quote the language of Sir Henry Ayers,
K.C.M.G.**&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[** From a lecture on "Pioneer Difficulties in
South Australia", by Sir Henry Ayers, K.C.M.G., delivered in
Adelaide in June, 1891.]</p>
<p>"The early settlers evinced great boldness in coming to this
country when they did, for it was no light undertaking for men
and women, with their children, to leave the comforts and
conveniences of civilization and venture to settle in a country
whose geographical position was not very generally understood,
and of whose productive powers absolutely nothing was known; and
it was the possession of like courage, when they were surrounded
with difficulties, which enabled them successfully to withstand
them. I have always urged and am still of opinion that the
greatest factor in overcoming our difficulties was the sterling
qualities of our pioneers.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** According to the classification of colonists
made by the Old Colonists' Association, "pioneers" included those
who arrived prior to the 28th of December, 1846, that being the
tenth anniversary of the day South Australia was proclaimed a
British colony, and "old colonists" were those who arrived
between December 28th, 1846, and December 28th, 1856.]</p>
<p>"Taking all classes together they were a superior sample of
the people of the mother country. . . . Our pioneer colonists had
their privations, their disappointments, and their losses, which
they bravely met. Most of them were extremely capable and
intelligent, possessed of sturdy endurance and self-reliance,
determined to succeed if success were possible. In short, they
were made of the right sort of stuff, and well worthy of the
grand old country whose sons they were. It was these qualities
which enabled them to meet and surmount the reverses with which
they were environed. They were, in numerous instances, young and
recently married, many marriages having been hastened to enable
the young people to cast their lot and try their fortunes in this
country. It is then, when men and women leave their homes and
have to found new ones, that even the painfulness of the
severance from their native land to do so is less felt than it
would be after forming a home soon to be broken up again. It is a
period, too, when men and women feel that they are all the world
to each other, so that as long as they are together the locality
of their residence is of less consequence. It is a time when new
enterprises may be undertaken with better hope of success, for
they are then possessed of double strength, with twice the amount
of hope and exhilaration that they have at any other era of their
existence, and there is no better period when a man may commence
a great and important or an arduous undertaking than when he has
the enthusiastic help and tender sympathy of a loving wife.</p>
<p>"With the prosperity that followed our adversity I should have
liked to have been able to say that the early settlers, who
worked so diligently and struggled so hard to sustain the
settlement of the colony, met with the good fortune such conduct
merited. Alas! it was not so. More fortunes were lost, or missed
of making, than had been retained or secured. The coming of
general prosperity was, so far as most of the pioneers were
concerned, only the renewal of fresh efforts more or less
empty-handed."</p>

<p>C<small>OLONEL</small> G<small>EORGE</small>
G<small>AWLER</small>, the second Governor of South Australia,
was a man of great ability, of calm determination, and withal of
intense enthusiasm and vigour. When he arrived in the colony he
was in his forty-second year, the prime of manhood. His previous
career had been adventurous and notable. Leaving the Military
College, Great Marlow, at the age of fifteen, he joined the 52nd
Light Infantry, and served to the end of the Peninsular campaign.
He was present at the battles and sieges of Badajoz, Vittoria,
Nives, Nivelles, Orthes, Toulouse, and Waterloo. As ensign he led
the forlorn hope at the storming of Badajoz, where he was struck
in the right knee by grapeshot, and fell from the parapet into
the ditch below. Here he would have perished but for his timely
rescue by a private of his own regiment, who laid down his life
to serve his officer. At Waterloo Colonel Gawler performed signal
service while commanding the right flank company of the 52nd
Regiment during the great charge on the Imperial Guards, for
which he received the war medal with seven clasps. After this he
was in the Civil Service; then he occupied the post of Governor
in one of the North American provinces for a period of three
years, and subsequently he employed his time in literary
pursuits.</p>
<p>When he was selected to supersede Captain Hindmarsh in the
important office of Governor of South Australia, and to combine
in himself the dual position of Governor and Resident
Commissioner, it of course became necessary that new instructions
should be issued, and these were clear and explicit. Enlarged
financial powers were given him, but he was reminded that, in
principle, South Australia was a self-supporting colony;
therefore, when the balance in hand upon the revenue fund was not
sufficient to pay accounts fully due, he could draw upon the
Emigration Fund; and if that fund was not sufficient, he could
draw a bill or bills of exchange upon the Commissioners; but that
no accounts so drawn were to exceed in the aggregate a total of
&pound;2500 per quarter, or &pound;10,000 in the year. At the
date of his appointment the expenses of the authorized
establishment of the colony amounted to &pound;8322 12<i>s</i>.
The power to draw to the extent of &pound;10,000, therefore, the
Commissioners reminded him, was in excess of the total fixed
expenses of the colony, and he was requested to "distinctly
understand that the right to exceed that expenditure was not
thereby in any degree extended."</p>
<p>When intelligence of the appointment of Colonel Gawler reached
South Australia, a gleam of hope, almost amounting to exultation,
took the place of irritation and despondency. The settlers
understood that they might be ruled somewhat despotically, but
they welcomed any change from the irritation of being ruled
almost entirely by men sixteen thousand miles away (by ship's
course), for the most part ignorant of the wants of the colonists
and of the physical capabilities of the country, and unaided by
those improvements in the communication of orders which modern
science has made known. Altogether, the position of the colonists
was one of great difficulty and uneasiness, and when, on the 12th
of October, 1838, the ship <i>Pestongee Bomangee</i>, with the
new Governor on board, dropped anchor in Holdfast Bay, there went
up a great sigh of relief, as if their burdens had already begun
to roll away.</p>
<p>On the 17th the Governor was publicly received in Adelaide,
about a thousand people meeting him on the Bay Road, and
escorting him to Government House, or "Hut".* Here a Council was
held, and the Governor took the oaths, which he afterwards
administered to Mr. G.M. Stephens, on his receiving the
appointment of colonial secretary; to Mr. H. Jickling, judge; and
to Mr. E. Bernard, acting advocate-general and Crown
solicitor.</p>
<p class="foot">[* When Colonel Gawler went to Government House,
it was only a temporary erection of one story, with a thatched
roof, the timbers principally of native pine, procured from what
was then called the "Pine Forest", since known as
Nailsworth.]</p>
<p>The reception was enthusiastic, everybody hoping that a reign
of peace and good-will would set in, now that they had an able
and influential man invested with the powers of Governor and
Resident Commissioner.</p>
<p>The routine addresses followed, but they were not of the
routine kind. There was an intense desire among the settlers to
develop the wonderful resources of the province, in which each
individual seemed to take a special pride. They had long suffered
from delays, hindrances, and vexations, inevitable in the
circumstances, and they were eager to encourage every action on
the part of the authorities which should throw open the country
more widely to capitalists and settlers.</p>
<p>The position of Captain Hindmarsh was, as we have seen, an
unenviable one, but that of Colonel Gawler was much more so. The
task before him was one of supreme difficulty. The contentions,
if they had not ceased altogether, were at least dormant, but
there was a vast network of financial difficulty before him. As,
later on, we shall have to consider the whole matter in detail,
it will be well in this place to give the Governor's estimate of
the situation in his own words, written within a fortnight of his
arrival in the colony:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I must, in the strongest manner, solicit the Commissioners'
most indulgent consideration. I am about to incur the heaviest
responsibilities, from which I could not shrink without
endangering the finest prospects of this most beautiful colony,
and my duty to the Colonization Commissioners. I find the public
offices established here much beyond the authorized number and
force furnished to me in England, and yet I am persuaded that,
with the consent of the Council, I must not only keep, but
probably increase, the existing establishments. The surveys are
altogether unequal to the demand for land; 21,000 acres of
preliminary purchases remain unsurveyed, and, of course, the
great mass of subsequent purchases unprovided for, and great
disappointment has been experienced. It is my intention, with the
consent of the Council, to put on every surveyor that I can
procure, until the survey comes up, or nearly up, to the demand.
The profits of capitalists are great; provisions, wages, and
house rent are very high; all prosper but the servants of
Government. To retain them in their places, it will be absolutely
necessary to increase their salaries, at least of the junior
classes, to something like a proportionate scale to those of
private officers. My instructions permit me to draw on England to
the amount of &pound;10,000 per annum. Within this year (1838),
upwards of &pound;12,000 has been already drawn; the third
quarter's salaries are still due; the treasury is absolutely
empty, and public debts to a considerable amount have been
incurred; urgent demands are made for payment, and the credit of
Government is therefore injuriously low. The colony itself is
most flourishing. I have great confidence that a proportionately
large revenue may be raised from it, and that in many things
public expenditure may be reduced. Care and exertion on my part
shall not be spared to accomplish these objects, but, until they
are attained, I must surpass my instructions, and look to England
for considerable unauthorized pecuniary assistance."</p>
<p>These words were written, as we have said, within a fortnight
of his arrival in the colony. The experience of a few more weeks
convinced him much more strongly that he was involved in most
aggravated and complicated difficulties. He found that the public
offices were carried on with scarcely a pretension to system;
"every man did as he would, and got on as he could." There were
scarcely any records of past proceedings, of public accounts, or
of issues of stores; innumerable complications had arisen in
consequence of the non-fulfilment of one of the leading
principles on which the regulations made for the disposal of land
were based, namely, that "the surveys should be in advance of the
demand," complications which the letter of the law as it stood
could not by any possibility set right; the survey department was
reduced to three individuals; immigrants were crowding into the
town, and leaving the country districts; the principal business
was in land-jobbing; capital was flowing out to Sydney and Van
Diemen's Land for the necessaries of life, as rapidly as it was
brought in by fresh arrivals from England; there was a dire
necessity for new public buildings of every kind; the gaol,
constructed for eight prisoners, always had an average of thirty
persons; in the Government "Hut" there was not tolerable
household or office accommodation; the two landing-places,
Holdfast Bay and the Old Port, were of the most indifferent
description; the cost of transport to and from these ports to
Adelaide was simply ruinous, and in the midst of all this, the
tide of immigration was flowing in with a rapidity which would
have taxed the resources of any young colony, however perfect its
organization might have been.</p>
<p>Colonel Gawler took an intense interest in the "experiment in
colonization" under trial, and, in spite of difficulties, he
threw all the strength of his great energy into the attempt to
make the scheme successful. Soon after his arrival his Council
was formed for the time being, and work began in earnest.</p>
<p>Amongst the first instructions sent out to Colonel Gawler by
the Commissioners, was one giving him authority to reconstruct
the survey staff, Colonel Light and his assistants having
resigned their appointments.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that when the dissensions between
Governor Hindmarsh and the surveyor-general were at their height,
Mr. G.S. Kingston was despatched to England to confer with the
Commissioners on the subject of the surveys. The Commissioners
insisted upon the surveys being carried out in a particular way,
distasteful to the surveyor-general, and in the event of his not
complying, Mr. Kingston was to supersede him. On receiving this
ultimatum. Colonel Light at once tendered his resignation, and
his example was followed by the whole of the officers of the
survey staff. For the awkward and unpleasant position in which he
found himself placed Mr. Kingston was in no wise responsible, the
action taken by the Board having been upon their own initiative.
A public meeting was held in Adelaide, at which the overwhelming
vote was in favour of the plan pursued by Colonel Light; but this
was not sufficient to induce him to withdraw his resignation. He
entered into business with Mr. B.T. Finniss, under the title of
Light, Finniss, and Co., but Colonel Light's health had been for
some time failing, and under the irritation of what he felt to be
unrequited public services in the colony, his

<p class="foot">[** In his last illness his great anxiety was to

<p class="foot">A more worthy and imposing monument was erected
in 1892.]</p>
<p>On the subject of the reconstruction of the survey staff, the
Board of Commissioners wrote to Colonel Gawler as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The Commissioners are desirous of placing, and do hereby
place, in your hands the fullest and most ample powers to
reorganize the surveying staff in whatever manner and to whatever
extent may appear to you most expedient, in order to render it
efficient, and to remedy, as far as may be practicable, the
interruption and delay in the progress of the surveys which these
resignations have occasioned."</p>
<p>This unrestricted licence became the source of one of Colonel
Gawler's greatest troubles, and led in no small measure to the
difficulties which culminated in one of the most disastrous
episodes in the history of the colony.</p>
<p>The possession of land, not for use or cultivation, but for
speculation, became a mania, many acting as if the whole
population of Great Britain were about to be suddenly transferred
to South Australia. As each fresh exploring party found out the
existence of good country, the desire to purchase became almost
irresistible. But as, immediately after survey, the deposit for
purchase had to be paid, the capital of the country, instead of
being employed in cultivating the land already held and in
effecting improvements, was either sent home to England for
expenditure in emigration purposes, or to the neighbouring
colonies for the purchase of the necessaries of life, and even
for timber, of which there was abundance in the colony. This was
a double evil in many respects. The Colonization Commissioners,
finding their coffers fill so rapidly, despatched emigrant ships
accordingly,* and the arrival of these in quick succession led
the Governor to incur expenses which the revenue of the province
was quite inadequate to meet. For the accommodation of these
immigrants some thirty or forty wooden houses had been erected to
the westward of the city, and even these were wholly insufficient
to afford the necessary shelter. In consequence of the
speculation in land, and a total disregard to its cultivation,
there was little employment for the new arrivals, and they,
therefore, for the most part were kept in the neighbourhood of
Adelaide; not only their shelter, but their provisions having to
be provided by the Government.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In 1838 the total land sold was 47,932 acres,
realizing &pound;47,932; and the number of emigrants who left
England for South Australia was 3154 souls.]</p>
<p>What to do with this unemployed labour was the problem the
gallant colonel at once set himself to solve. Impressed with an
anxious desire to improve the colony, and feeling convinced that
this could only be done by a liberal expenditure of money, he
determined to embark in a series of enterprises. And truly he
entered upon the execution of his plan with wonderful spirit and
energy, and scattered money in a right royal manner. He built an
extensive and well-finished Government House, commodious offices
for the various Government departments, a custom house, gaol, and
hospital; he remodelled and extended the survey department;
enrolled a large police force, both foot and mounted; formed
roads, sent out exploring parties, and introduced bold and
decisive measures everywhere and in everything. This kept a large
amount of money afloat, gave employment to numbers of immigrants,
and produced what appeared at the time to be a state of general
prosperity. But, unfortunately, the erection of Government works
on this extensive scale induced the colonists to launch out into
erecting shops and warehouses, and far-seeing men whispered that
very soon wages would go up as well as the price of provisions,
and that, for all the apparent prosperity, a day of reckoning was
not far distant.</p>
<p>The bills drawn by Colonel Gawler on the Commissioners, and
presented to them during the first half of the year 1839,
amounted to &pound;8560, and during the last half to
&pound;10,600.</p>
<p>Besides the erection of public buildings, the Governor tackled
the subject of official salaries, which were absurdly small,**
and raised them from the 1st of January, 1839. He added also
largely to the police force. In all these arrangements the
Commissioners appear to have heartily concurred. In their
despatches during 1839 the following and several similar passages
occur:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[** A committee was appointed to inquire and
report on this subject, and one of the documents sent in by them,
and afterwards transmitted by the Governor to the Commissioners,
was the following statement of the weekly expenses of a single
gentleman and his servant at that time:&mdash;</p>

<p class="foot">&mdash;If such were the necessary expenses of a
single gentleman and his servant, what must have been those of a
married man with ft family? With the exception of the Governor
and the judge, whose salaries at this time were &pound;800 and
&pound;500 respectively, the highest were &pound;400 per annum,
and only two or three were in receipt of so much, the greater
number varying from &pound;250 to &pound;100.]</p>
<p>"I am directed to assure you" (wrote the secretary of the
board) "that the Commissioners will do everything in their power
to sustain your proper authority; that so far as their
information enables them to judge they fully approve of the steps
you have hitherto taken, and that you may safely rely on their
efficient co-operation in all measures calculated to promote the
welfare of the colony."</p>
<p>Again&mdash;</p>
<p>"You will observe that while certain rules are laid down for
your guidance, you are authorized to deviate from them under
peculiar circumstances, and on certain conditions, one of the
most important of which is that the grounds for such deviation
shall be placed fully and without delay before the Board."</p>
<p>These sanctions and expressions of approval naturally led
Colonel Gawler to conclude that his course of action gave
satisfaction, and accordingly, therefore, he went on in the same
way.</p>
<p>While matters in official quarters were thus in progress the
colonists were seized with the same spirit of enterprise, and
broke forth into various new undertakings. For example&mdash;</p>
<p>In January, 1839, the first "special survey" of four thousand
acres was applied for by Mr. F.H. Dutton on behalf of himself,
Mr. D. Macfarlane, and Captain Finniss, colonists of New South
Wales. This was followed by several other applications of a
similar kind, and the race for them became almost as great, in
some instances, as it afterwards was for taking up mineral
leases. In one case the manager of the South Australian Company
proceeded to Port Lincoln to look out for a good locality, and
before he returned the one fixed upon had been applied for and
taken, the second best being then selected by the unfortunate
manager. Soon a "rush" was made to Port Lincoln and a new
settlement formed; trading vessels proceeded there with
provisions, passengers, and building materials, and for a time it
seemed as if the capital would be supplanted; the <i>Port Lincoln
Herald</i> was established, and all went well until the bubble
burst, and then people began to return to the capital.</p>
<p>In the times of the land-purchase mania the transactions were
not always on a large scale; purchasers of preliminary or
eighty-acre sections split them up into very small building
allotments, ranging from &pound;3 to &pound;5 and upwards in
value. Besides the usual sales by land agents there was an
evening auction in Hindley Street, where fenders and fire-irons,
spades and axes, or allotments of building land could be
purchased. As in those days the mart was, with the exception of
the little theatre and the public-house, the only resort for
colonists when the day's work was done, the clever and witty
auctioneer always kept a large audience in high good humour,
besides doing a considerable trade.</p>
<p>Great enterprise was shown in many other directions, notably
in the matter of minor explorations by parties in search of
suitable localities for special surveys, as well as for sheep and
cattle stations. In one instance Messrs. Strangways and Blunden
discovered a fine river in the north, and named it the Gawler,
and this gave an impetus to the occupation of the land in this
direction. Other discoveries were made about the same time by
Messrs. Cock and Jamieson, who visited Yorke's Peninsula, and
penetrated into hitherto unknown parts of the country, and
subsequently by Mr. K. Cook in a trip up Spencer's Gulf, where he
discovered three harbours.</p>
<p>In 1839 a considerable knowledge of the south-east part of the
colony was obtained from Mr. Charles Bonney, who opened up a new
route overland from New South Wales, and by Major (afterwards
Sir) Thomas Mitchell, the explorer of a large portion of New
South Wales and Australia Felix (Victoria), who reached the
boundary of the South Australian colony on the Glenelg River,
after proving the junction of the Darling, the Lachlan, and the
Murrumbidgee with the Murray on its northern side. Governor
Gawler made a flying visit to the north-west bend of the river
Murray, accompanied by a young man named Bryan, a visitor at
Government House. Mr. Bryan's horse gave up, and it was necessary
that he should remain with it while the Governor and his
attendant proceeded to find water for man and beast. The weather
was fearfully hot. Before the searchers could reach the river
they were so exhausted that one of the horses was killed and his
blood drunk. On reaching the camp from whence they had started,
men and horses were sent on their return tracks with all that was
necessary to save man and horse. But Mr. Bryan was not to be
found. Search was made in all directions for many miles, but
although, years afterwards, the horse was found alive, "with his
hoofs turned up like skates," no trace of the unfortunate visitor
to Government House was ever discovered.* The Governor also
visited that part of the Murray within the boundary of South
Australia, and made some valuable geological observations.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mount Bryant, in the locality where he was
lost, is named after him.]</p>
<p>But all these exploits sank into insignificance in comparison
with the heroic attempt of Mr. E.J. Eyre to open up overland
communication with Western Australia. The idea had been suggested
by Captain (afterwards Sir) George Grey when on a visit to the
new colony <i>en route</i> to England, and Colonel Gawler warmly
encouraged the fitting out of the expedition. The story has been
many times and splendidly told, but by no one better than the
late Henry Kingsley.** We can only give a meagre outline of it
here.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See <i>Macmillan's Magazine</i>, vol. xii. p.
502.]</p>
<p>On the 18th of June, 1840, Mr. Eyre, accompanied by Mr. Scott,
a personal friend and travelling companion, John Baxter, an
overseer, Corporal Coles, of the Sappers and Miners, and two
native boys, together with drays, horses, and sheep, started,
amid the cheers of the whole populace, to explore the interior of
South Australia. But in this he was unsuccessful. He forced his
way for four hundred miles to the north of Adelaide, and got into
what was then known as the basin of Lake Torrens, a fearful
country of alternate mud, brackish water, and sand. Proceeding
into the basin of the lake, he found it coated with an unbroken
sheet of salt crust, into which the foot sank at every step.
Beaten back from the north at all points, and bitterly
disappointed, he came to the conclusion that he could proceed no
further in that direction.</p>
<p>"I had one of three alternatives to choose," he wrote at this
critical juncture, "either to give up the expedition altogether,
to cross to the Murray to the east and follow up that river to
the Darling, or, by crossing over to Streaky Bay to the westward,
to endeavour to find some opening leading towards the interior in
that direction. After weighing well the advantages and
disadvantages of each (and there were many objections to them
all), I determined upon adopting the last."</p>
<p>After many difficulties and dangers, he formed a dep&ocirc;t
of his party at Streaky Bay, and spent weary months in trying to
find a way to the westward or northward. His attempts to round
the head of the Great Bight&mdash;a part of the coast described
as "a hideous anomaly, a blot on the face of nature, the sort of
place one gets into in bad dreams"&mdash;were desperate. Water
was only to be obtained by digging, and then it was generally
brackish; the heat was terrific; the cliffs were parched and
barren; everything along that desolate coast, where for seven
hundred miles no harbour fit to shelter a small boat, and for
eleven hundred miles no rill of water so big as a child's finger,
are to be found, was forbidding and horrible. After a journey of
twenty-four days in an attempt to round the head of the Bight, he
returned to the camp unsuccessful, but only to start again with a
dray-load of water, and after making a distance of 138 miles, to
return again with his task unaccomplished, although within twelve
miles of the Bight. A final effort was made, and he reached the
head of the Bight. The actual distance was only 153 miles, but to
reach the goal he had to ride 643 miles and to labour incessantly
for forty days, while a dray laden with water was driven
backwards and forwards for 238 miles. . But the Bight was only
one incident of the expedition. He was convinced he could not
penetrate to the northward in that direction with drays, and he
came to the heroic determination to reduce his followers and go
westward to King George's Sound, the original goal of the
expedition, with packhorses only.</p>
<p>Then came a day when he informed his companion, Mr. Scott,
that they must part, as he intended only to take three native
boys&mdash;among whom was one named Wylie, of King George's
Sound&mdash;as they would be of most service in the country to be
passed over. To Baxter, the overseer, and for some years his
faithful servant, Mr. Eyre pointed out the extreme peril of the
undertaking, in which he was resolved to succeed or perish, and
left it to him to decide whether he would go forward or return.
The faithful fellow never hesitated for a moment, but resolved to
go forward at all hazards. For some weeks the horses were fed up
and rested for the task before them; meanwhile, those of the
party who were to return to Adelaide had long since left in the
cutter placed at the service of Eyre by the Government. But on
the 24th of January, 1841, the day when Eyre was making his final
preparations to leave, he was startled by the report of a gun. It
was fired by Mr. Scott, who had returned from Adelaide bearing
letters and verbal messages innumerable, urging Eyre to abandon
his dangerous task. But he was not to be moved, and on the
following day, after bidding a final farewell to Scott, he
started with Baxter, Wylie, two other natives, nine horses, a
Timor pony, and some sheep, on one of the most daring expeditions
ever conceived.</p>
<p>Leaving Fowler's Bay, they kept along the coast, and, beyond
the Bight, came upon high cliffs unbroken for many miles by a
single ravine, and here the terrible part of the journey began.
On one occasion they were four days without water, and the horses
and sheep with scarcely a particle of food; on another they were
reduced to such straits that Eyre found it necessary to cast away
everything that was not essential to life; sometimes they were
rejoicing over a quart or so of water collected by a sponge from
the dew on the grass. Some of the horses died, some were
abandoned; the sheep failed; two of the natives became
disaffected and absconded, but, being unable to find food in the
desert, returned apparently repentant.</p>
<p>One day&mdash;it was the 29th of April&mdash;having made an
early start, and the weather being intensely hot, Baxter pleaded
for an early halt. After some hesitation Eyre consented, and
agreed to take the first watch. He saw Baxter and the boys lie
down in their respective break-winds, and then went a short
distance from the camp to look after his horses. It was a wild,
cold night; the wind was blowing hard from the south-west, and
scud was driving across the moon. Just as Eyre was leading his
horses round, towards the end of his watch, he saw a flash, and
heard the report of a gun. Calling out and receiving no answer,
he ran towards the spot, and was met by Wylie, crying, "Oh,
massa, massa, come here!" To his horror he found Baxter on the
ground by the camp-fire, weltering in his blood, and in the last
agonies of death. A glance around showed that the place had been
ransacked by the two disaffected native boys, who, having aroused
Baxter while securing the rifles and other things, had shot him
in the breast as they decamped.</p>
<p>Alone in a waterless desert, five hundred miles away from all
human aid. Eyre covered the body of his faithful friend, gathered
together the few things left by the treacherous natives, and with
the boy Wylie proceeded on his lonely journey overwhelmed with
unutterable grief.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of May, water was found at a distance of a hundred
and thirty miles from the last supply; on the 11th a hill was
descried, the first properly so called that had been seen for
many hundred miles, and then there was a marked change for the
better in the character of the country; water, became more
abundant, and an occasional kangaroo was killed.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of June, while in Thistle Cove, Eyre, weak and
exhausted, but bearing up against despair, beheld a gladsome
sight. It was a boat being pulled towards a French whaler, the
<em>Mississippi</em>. Almost wild with joy, the lonely man stood
on the verge of a wave-worn rock, and made signals to the vessel.
A boat was at once put off to take him and the boy on board,
where they were treated with great kindness, supplied with a
stock of clothes, and for twelve days enjoyed rest and boundless
hospitality. Refreshed and invigorated, and furnished with an
ample supply of provisions, the travellers started again on their
journey. On the 4th of July some horse tracks showed them they
were approaching the haunts of civilized men, and on the 7th they
were received in the town of Albany with enthusiastic delight.
"Wylie was in the bosom of his enraptured tribe, and Eyre was
shaking hands with Lady Spencer," after his thousand miles'
journey. A week later he left King George's Sound, and on the
26th of July, after an absence of little more than, a year, was
once more in Adelaide, the ideal hero of all classes.</p>
<p>The geographical knowledge gained by this remarkable
expedition extended little beyond a description of the coast-line
between Streaky Bay and King George's Sound, but the gain to
South Australia in other respects was nevertheless incalculable.
The minds of the settlers were moulded to delight in brave deeds
and glorious enterprise; they were all more or less making
history, all interested in one way or another in the development
of the vast territory they had come across the seas to possess,
all fired with ambition to do their best in their respective
spheres, and the courage, piety, and self-sacrifice of Edward
John Eyre set them an example and taught them a lesson that was
worth the learning.</p>
<p>Leaving this field of stirring adventure, we must now return
to follow the more prosaic course of events in Adelaide.</p>
<p>In January, 1840, in order to satisfy the Commissioners that
the excessive expenditure during 1839 had been absolutely
necessary, the Governor appointed a board of audit, consisting of
three colonists not belonging to the Government, to act with the
auditor-general. This course, he thought, would relieve him of
some of the responsibility he felt in sanctioning so many
overdrafts, and would justify him in entering into further
engagements of an urgent character.</p>
<p>It was this question of urgency that was at the root of all
the main difficulties of the Governor. He could not consult with
any one. Those who held the reins were sixteen thousand miles
away. "The regulations issued by the Commissioners in London, as
published in their third annual report of April 23, 1839, look
very complete and ingenious on paper, but they involved an amount
of complexity and delay which rendered their observance in a new
country an impossibility without an absolute stoppage of all
government, and these are the extenuating: circumstances with
which all the financial proceedings of Governor Gawler must be
regarded." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* "The Constitutional History of South
Australia", by B. T Finniss.]</p>
<p>As a means of partial relief the colonists in April
memorialized the Secretary of State for an extension of the
Legislative Council, urging only two points as essential to the
good government of the province, namely, that there should be a
certain number of non-official members chosen freely by the
people, and that if any law were unanimously opposed by the
non-official members it should not take effect without the
sanction of her Majesty. Nothing, however, came immediately of
this, and in the mean time South Australian affairs at home were
undergoing considerable change.</p>
<p>In June tidings reached the colony that the Board of
Commissioners had been disbanded, and that a new Commission of
only three members had been appointed as a Colonial Land and
Emigration Board.</p>
<p>Of course the members of the old Board were not very well
pleased with their summary dismissal, especially when, about six
months afterwards, they were asked to attach their signatures to
a report of their proceedings not even drawn up by themselves.
Mr. Jacob Montefiore declined absolutely to sign the
document.</p>
<p>For five years the Commissioners had given the most faithful
and zealous gratuitous attention to their arduous work, and now
when, as it appeared, the colony was approaching a state of
unparalleled prosperity, the action of Lord John Russell in
disbanding them immediately an application had been made by some
of their number to receive remuneration for their services, was
very keenly felt.</p>
<p>Colonel Torrens, who had been chairman of the Board of
Commissioners from the first (at a nominal salary of &pound;600
per annum), occupied a similar position on the new Board. Not
long after his appointment to the new Commission, he entered into
correspondence with Lord John Russell on the propriety of
resigning his seat in consequence of having interest in some land
in South Australia to the value of &pound;1000. Lord John took
the same view of this case that Lord Glenelg had taken in the
case of Mr. Angas, already cited, and all that Colonel Torrens
could obtain was permission to hold office temporarily.</p>
<p>On the dismissal of the Board of Commissioners, an association
was formed in London called "The South Australian Society", the
members of which comprised several of the late Commissioners,
directors of the South Australian Company, and other friends of
the colony, its main object being to guard against any
encroachment on the leading principles contained in the Act of
Parliament upon which the province was founded. On many occasions
this society, as we shall see, rendered the colony essential
service in the mother-country.</p>
<p>While these matters were going on at home, affairs in the
colony were in a very complicated state. The Governor was
becoming more and more embarrassed with financial and other
difficulties; speculators were pushing their schemes with
redoubled vigour, as if fearing an approaching crisis; wages of
mechanics and labourers had risen to almost fabulous rates, and
the price of provisions was extravagantly high.</p>
<p>The position of the Governor was as peculiar as it was
difficult. He had to work out new principles in a colony that had
sprung into existence at a bound, and had advanced with a
rapidity unequalled in the history of British colonization.
Nevertheless, he stood firm to the policy he had initiated at the
first, and watched the progress of events with alternate feelings
of anxiety and good hope.</p>
<p>The important work undertaken by the South Australian Company
in constructing an admirable road to the port over the old swamp,
and in erecting a suitable and much-needed wharf and warehouses,
was so far advanced that on the 14th of October, 1840, they were
thrown open to the public, the event being celebrated by a
fitting demonstration, at which the Governor presided. In honour
of the manager of the South Australian Company, by whom these
improvements were projected and successfully carried out, the
wharf was named the "McLaren Wharf"&mdash;a name it retains to
the present day. At the ceremony some five thousand people
assembled, and the day's proceedings included a regatta, a
novelty in the new settlement.</p>
<p>The apparently flourishing condition of the colony at this
time not only attracted a number of the free population of the
neighbouring convict settlements of New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land, but several of the convicts also whose rendezvous
was in that part then known as the "Tiers" on the Mount Barker
road, where dense forest and almost inaccessible gullies offered
them a safe retreat. The unwelcome visitors made a large increase
in the crime of the infant settlement, and kept the colonists, in
some parts of the bush, in a constant state of alarm. And not
there only. Mr. John Hutt, at that time Governor of Western
Australia, wrote to a gentleman in South Australia as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p align="right"><small>"Perth, Western Australia, July 17th,
1840.</small>   </p>
<p>"I say nothing of the overland expedition which you vivacious
folk are threatening us with; we propose offering, I believe, to
meet you with, provisions at some appointed place. Your stock
will be very acceptable to us, but not so your bushrangers, who,
I see, have begun their ravages near Adelaide. I wish to keep as
wide a gulf as possible between us and them. We have nothing as
yet much to tempt them, but this overland route would show them
the way, and we have no police or money to raise a corps. The sea
is quite sufficient, with common prudence in those who ship
stock, for all communication between us; and although, when Mr.
Eyre related to me the horrible country he passed over to and
beyond Streaky Bay, I regretted to find that my favourite
colony's fertile boundaries were so circumscribed, yet I-could
not help secretly rejoicing that you had quite enough to keep you
employed for the present without looking further west, and that
if you did that you would find no encouragement from Nature. I do
not doubt that if this passage is to be effected South Australian
energy and determination and eagerness will do it; but long may
the south land flourish and spread its branches and saplings far
and wide any way, save to the westward."</p>
<p>Of the state of crime in the colony at this period, Mr.
Alexander Tolmer, then sub-inspector of mounted police, says, "No
precautions had been adopted to prevent the importation of
escaped convicts or ticket-of-leave men from the neighbouring
penal settlements, and the consequence was that the colony was
overrun with such persons, and the police found constant
employment in hunting and apprehending them. That such was the
state of things by the unchecked importation of this class of
bandits may be gathered from the fact that, out of thirty
prisoners tried at the gaol delivery on the 3rd of March, 1840,
there was only one convicted who had come to the colony direct
from England, and among the twenty-five prisoners who were
awaiting their trial for different offences at the next sessions,
there were but five English emigrants, the remaining twenty being
either escaped convicts, ticket-of-leave men, or emancipists from
New South Wales or Van Diemen's Land. There were no orders issued
to the port police with regard to the crews and passengers of
vessels arriving from the penal settlements, and not the
slightest attention was paid to the subject, either at Glenelg or
at the port, and a shipload of escaped convicts could at any time
be landed without remark or remonstrance. Again, there was no
check upon overland parties arriving with stock, and it was
notorious that some of the worst desperadoes of New South Wales
found their way hither by that route, and after squandering their
money in drunkenness and debauchery in town, would retire to the
'Tiers' and join others who had preceded them, living in log-huts
built in deep and almost inaccessible gullies and ravines,
densely timbered and overgrown with scrub and vegetation. Under
cover of dark nights they would thence sally forth, and commit
daring black-faced robberies and burglaries in the city, and
again find shelter in their fastnesses, and 'plant' the plunder,
or otherwise be harboured by sympathizers and accomplices in
town, creatures of the same type as themselves, some of whom were
publicans."</p>
<p>Many thrilling stories of adventure and misadventure have been
told of this period of lawlessness, and many more prosaic tales
of loss, especially by owners of cattle.** The South Australian
Company were great losers in this respect, and it was an
additional mortification to them to be aware that beasts
innumerable belonging to them were being shot, skinned, the
brands destroyed, and the meat salted and shipped to foreign
markets.</p>
<p class="foot">[** A notorious bushranger, Patrick Murphy,
<em>alias</em> Blue Cap, was believed to be in Adelaide, and the
Government of New South Wales offered &pound;100 for his capture.
Mr. Alexander Tolmer was soon on his track, and received
information that a suspicious-looking character had been seen on
the way to the Tiers. How the capture was made may best be told
in Mr. Tolmer's own words. The story gives a glimpse into the
state of the times, and at the iron-nerved men who had to deal
with the desperadoes of that day. "On turning the comer where the
Stag Inn is now," says Mr. Tolmer. "I descried the individual
some distance ahead on the track across the park-lands leading to
Gleeson's Hill. On hearing me approach, he suddenly stopped and
half turned, but, owing to my horse being hard in the mouth and
excitable, I passed him a few paces. The glance I obtained of his
face, however, satisfied me that he was the identical man whose
description had been received from Sydney a few days before. The
moment he stopped he placed himself in a peculiar attitude, with
both hands under the lapels of his coat, and it struck me
forcibly that he had a pistol in each hand. However, without
hesitation, I gently urged my horse nearer the fellow and said,
'Why, I know you; you are Patrick Murphy!' to which he replied,
'Well, what do you want?' By this time I had managed to approach
near enough to his person, and, quickly leaning forward, seized
his collar, saying, 'You are my prisoner', which action caused my
right spur to touch my horse's side, when he made a sidelong
plunge, and as the fellow threw himself back at the same time, I
was dragged of! the saddle to the ground, and in falling brought
the prisoner down with me. We then both sprung up together, I
still retaining a firm grip of the collar; he then struck me on
the side of the head with his fist. Being then satisfied he had
no pistols, I at once loosened hold of him and dealt him a heavy
blow in the face, which knocked him down. He nimbly got up again,
however, when we had a regular set-to, which lasted some minutes.
He was no match for me, however, which he soon admitted, and
surrendered, saying, 'Well, now you've got your
&pound;100!'"]</p>
<p>Any number of picturesque and amusing stories might be told of
proceedings in the law courts and courts of justice in the early
days of the colony. Here is one as a specimen. On the 11th of
November, 1840, Joseph Stagg, charged with the wilful murder of a
man named John Gofton, an escaped prisoner, was brought up for
trial at the Supreme Court&mdash;that is to say, at the residence
of his Honour Judge Cooper, in Whitmore Square. "The room used as
the court contained two French windows, which opened into the
garden, the judge's elevated seat being between the two. On the
judge's left hand, along the side wall, were the jury; on his
right, fronting the jury, was the prisoner in the dock, with Mr.
Ashton, the governor of the gaol, standing on the left side; and
opposite the witness-box immediately under the bench, at a large
table covered with law books, briefs, etc., sat the sheriff, Mr.
Newenham, the officers of the court, the advocate-general, Mr.
Charles Mann, the counsel for the prisoner. Sir James Fisher,
Messrs. Poulden, Nicholls, and others; and on the floor, on the
right of the bench, were chairs occupied by ladies.</p>
<p>"Just as Mr. Tolmer of the police, the first witness in the
case, was giving evidence, a sudden sharp report was heard, like
that of a pistol or rifle, followed by repeated cries, 'He's shot
at!' In an instant Mr. Tolmer drew his sword; the foreman of the
jury, followed by the other eleven, dashed through one open
window into the garden; judge, lawyers, and ladies rushed
pell-mell through the other; the governor of the gaol locked the
prisoner's left arm within his, and with the other held a pistol
at his head, while Mr. Tolmer stayed beside him with drawn
sword."</p>
<p>The general idea was that, as Mr. Tolmer was the principal
witness, some confederate of the prisoner had fired at him to
prevent his giving further evidence, but when the excitement and
terror had subsided it was found that a defective beam in the
floor, which was over the cellar, had snapped owing to the
overcrowded state of the room! In a short time the break was made
safe by means of supports, and the trial proceeded, ending in the
death sentence on the unhappy man Joseph Stagg.</p>
<p>A startling and terrible episode occurred in July of this
year. Tidings reached Adelaide that a vessel had been wrecked on
the Coorong beach, near where the <i>Fanny</i> went ashore, and
that ten white men, five women, and seven children had been
brutally massacred by natives of the Melmenrura, or Big Murray,
tribe. Mr. Pullen (afterwards Admiral Pullen) was immediately
despatched in a whaleboat from Encounter Bay to ascertain the
truth or otherwise of the ghastly rumour. He found the wrecked
vessel was the <i>Maria</i>, which had left Port Adelaide a few
weeks previously with a crew of nine persons and fifteen
passengers. He found also several bodies of murdered persons, and
having interred them he returned to report the case to the
Government.</p>
<p>The gallant Major T.S. O'Halloran, Commissioner of
Police&mdash;a man whose career was as full of adventure as that
of a hero of romance&mdash;and a party of mounted police,
accompanied by several colonists, at once set forth to make
further investigations. Considerable difficulty was experienced
in finding out the perpetrators of the horrible deed, but at
length two were given up by the tribes as the actual murderers.
It was deemed expedient to resort at once to some exemplary
punishment in the immediate locality of the murders, and the two
natives were, after a deliberate investigation on the spot,
executed&mdash;a step that was severely censured in many
quarters. Eventually twenty-three bodies in all were found of the
twenty-four who had embarked in the <i>Maria</i>.</p>
<p>Through the instrumentality of "Peter", a friendly native. Dr.
Penny, who visited the scene of the murders some months after the
first executions, succeeded in obtaining from the aborigines
eleven pounds in gold and silver, and a coin valued at four
shillings. In his report to the Government he says, "I questioned
the party, who consisted of two of the Melmenrura tribe and
thirteen of the Tenkinyra and Toora tribes, through my natives,
as to the murders, which they confessed to have perpetrated, but
showed apparent regret for their crime. I gathered from them that
they had brought the whole party up a long way, showed them
water, fished, and carried their children for them for a
considerable time. That when they came to this point, they could
not take them any further, as their country ends there, and the
'Picannini Murray' begins. They then demanded some clothes and
blankets for their trouble, but the white people refused to give
them, yet said if they would take them to Adelaide they should
have plenty. This they could not do, so they began to help
themselves, and this being resisted, ended in the murder of the
whole. The white men fought for some time, but the natives broke
their arms with waddies and then speared them. They were also
jealous of the next tribe, into whose territory they would then
have passed, and who, being in the habit of visiting Adelaide,
could have taken them up and have obtained the reward promised to
them."</p>
<p>This native account seemed plausible, but it did not mitigate
the regret felt for the unfortunate individuals, who, having
escaped the dangers of shipwreck, lost their lives under such
melancholy circumstances. It was the greatest calamity that had
taken place in the colony, and it was long before the gloom was
dissipated.</p>
<p>The punishment of the natives was considered by many to be
almost as terrible as the crime, and this gave rise to much
comment and censure in the colony and in the newspaper press
everywhere.</p>
<p>The "Native Question" here, as in other colonies, bristled
with difficulties, and moreover was always cropping up. This was
not the first occasion when drastic measures had to be taken to
protect the lives and property of the settlers. In the fourth
report of the Commissioners (1839) the first fatal collision of
the colonists with the natives was recorded. "The province," so
ran the report, "has been the theatre of one of those appalling
tragedies which, occasionally occurring in every region where man
is found, bring home the conviction of his imperfect nature," a
statement which could not lay claim to any marked originality.
But the report continued&mdash;</p>
<p>"Three settlers have been murdered by the natives, and two
natives have been tried, convicted, and executed for the crime.
The perpetration of such crimes and their expiation by capital
punishment are events which must, under any circumstances, be
deeply deplored, and which in the present instance cannot be
contemplated without exciting the most painful feelings. To
subject savage tribes to the penalties of laws with which they
are unacquainted, for offences which they may possibly regard as
acts of justifiable retaliation for invaded rights, is a
proceeding indefensible except under circumstances of urgent and
extreme necessity. Such circumstances had unhappily occurred in
the case under consideration. The authorities of South Australia
had no choice but to pursue a course of judicial proceedings
according to English law. The murder of the two settlers had
excited amongst their brethren a violent sentiment of fear, as
well as of anger, towards the aborigines. The prospect of further
assassinations, in consequence of no punishment being inflicted
upon the perpetrators of those which had taken place, would have
been intolerable. If the murderers had not been tried, convicted,
and legally punished, the settlers, unprotected by the governing
authorities, would have been obliged to take the law into their
own hands, and in their fear and rage might have commenced an
exterminating warfare against the natives. The necessities of the
case left but a choice of evils, and the authorities chose the
least."</p>
<p>There was a great, outcry in many quarters at the severity of
the punishment inflicted in both the cases we have cited, and the
Commissioners attempted to vindicate the carrying out of the
British law in these words&mdash;</p>
<p>"In establishing a new colony it is one of the first and most
sacred duties of the Government to protect the native races, but
to protect the natives against the colonists without at the same
time protecting the colonists against the natives would be
impracticable. The aborigines cannot have the protection of
British law without being amenable to British law. To place the
European and native races under different codes would be to place
them in hostility to each other. If it be necessary to inflict
the punishment of death for the murder of a native, it is equally
necessary to inflict that punishment for the murder of a settler
by a native."</p>
<p>Unhappily the poor savage, conscious of his inferiority and
his inability to bring those who offended against him to
punishment, often had to submit to unkind and even brutal
treatment, for which there was no redress, and, writhing under
the wrongs he endured, he would entertain feelings of resentment,
ending sometimes in his taking summary revenge on supposed, as
well as on real, enemies.</p>
<p>"Can it be deemed surprising," asked Mr. Eyre, who knew the
native character as well as any one, "that a rude, uncivilized
being, driven from his home, deprived of all his ordinary means
of subsistence, and pressed perhaps by a hostile tribe from
behind, should occasionally be guilty of aggressions or injuries
towards his oppressors? The wonder rather is, not that these
things do sometimes occur, but that they occur so rarely. In
addition to the many other inconsistencies in our conduct towards
the aborigines, not the least extraordinary is that of placing
them, on the plea of protection, under the influence of our laws,
and of making them British subjects. Strange anomaly, which by
the former makes them amenable to penalties they are ignorant of,
for crimes which they do not consider as such, or which they may
even have been driven to commit by our own injustice, and by the
latter but mocks them with an empty sound, since the very laws
under which we profess to place them, by their nature and
constitution, are inoperative in affording redress to the
injured. . . ."</p>
<p>In addition to the official Protector of Aborigines in the
colony, the natives had the sympathy of an association in the
mother country, established for the express purpose of affording
such protection to them <i>as it could</i>. But seeing they were
so far away, and had to rely upon reports not always well
authenticated, they sometimes condemned actions taken on the
spot, and thus, instead of being of any assistance to the
aborigines, they unintentionally created a prejudice against
those whom they were endeavouring to serve.</p>
<p>But the natives had friends nearer at hand, who were zealously
Labouring for their welfare. The first direct missionary efforts
on their behalf were made by Messrs. C.G. Teichelmann and C.W.
Sch&uuml;rmann, who were sent out by the Lutheran Missionary
Society at Dresden, under the auspices and mainly at the expense
of Mr. G.F. Angas, in 1838. They were followed in 1840 by two
other missionaries from the same society, Messrs. H.A.C. Meyer
and Y. Klose.</p>
<p>In 1839 Messrs. Teichelmann and Sch&uuml;rmann, in conjunction
with Mr. Moorhouse, Protector of Aborigines in succession to Mr.
Wyatt, commenced school operations, and soon acquired a
sufficient knowledge of the language to publish vocabularies. But
although some of the children learned to read and to write, and
adults came to listen to the gospel preached in their own tongue,
it was always discouraging work, as they were constantly
migrating from place to place.</p>
<p>In course of time it was found that teaching in the native
tongue was a mistake, and a complete change in the plan of
procedure was effected. The objections to imparting instruction
in the native tongue were set forth by Mr. Eyre to this
effect:&mdash;1. The length of time and labour required for the
instructor to master the language. 2. The very few natives he
could instruct, almost every tribe speaking a different dialect.
3. The sudden stop that would be put to all instruction if the
preceptor became ill or died, as no one could supply his place.
4. If the children could not speak in the language ordinarily
spoken by the colonists, they would be debarred from the
advantage of casual instruction or information, and also from
entering upon duties or relations with Europeans amongst whom
they might be living. 5. By adhering to the native language they
would become more deeply confirmed in their original feelings and
prejudices, and more thoroughly kept under the influence and
direction of their own people.</p>
<p>Schools were established in several places on this new method,
but no great success attended the efforts of the teachers;
nevertheless, it is interesting to note that even at this early
period in the history of the colony, when every nerve was being
strained to increase commercial prosperity, the colonists were
disposed to give time and attention to philanthropic subjects.
The Governor watched the progress of the German missionaries with
much interest, and wrote of them to Mr. Angas in July, 1840,
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have very great reason to believe them to be sincere,
intelligent, persevering Christian men, and if their efforts had
not at all succeeded, they, I think, would have been blameless.
The change of the aborigines, in any moderate time, even to mere
civilization, would be an especial effect of the power of God.
The deep-rooted prejudices of a very ancient people, agreeing
universally throughout the whole island in the leading points of
a very ancient system, are not to be overcome in a few years. The
Protector and missionaries have done much to shake it, but the
progress will be slow, and not very discernible to indifferent
spectators."</p>
<p>The Governor was a religious man, and gladly supported all
philanthropic workers, while, as a good Churchman, he naturally
took a strong interest in all Church questions. It will be
remembered that in the original South Australian Act of 1834
there had crept in a clause giving authority to create colonial
chaplains, and the Rev. C.B. Howard had been sent out with the
first Governor in this official capacity. But the friends of the
voluntary system had from the first made it a <i>sine qua non</i>
that the new colony should be absolutely and entirely free from
any connection whatever between Church and State, and they
agitated with such effect that on the 31st of July, 1838, an
amended South Australian Act passed the British Parliament,
partly to set at rest certain doubts as to the powers vested in
the Commissioners, but mainly to repeal that part of the previous
Act which related to the appointment by the Crown of chaplains
and clergymen. This was, of course, not regarded with favour by
the Church party, and it became one of the burning questions of
the day. The Governor's views on the religious outlook are well
given in a letter he wrote to Mr. G.F. Angas:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="right"><small>"July 10th, 1840.</small>   </p>
<p>"Many circumstances have arisen to force very strongly upon my
attention the religious necessities of the colony. . . . Our
deficiencies in places of worship and ministers of the gospel are
very great; they do not keep pace with immigration. I lately made
a careful calculation, and from it believe that the utmost limit
of religious accommodation will not include the means of
attendance for more than eighteen hundred persons; from these
must be deducted at least one-sixth for the average of absentees,
leaving an attendance of fifteen hundred out of a population of
nearly fifteen thousand. Several of the buildings included in
this calculation are private houses, others are very temporary
erections, and some others are very much in debt. . . .</p>
<p>"The current voluntary system, I deliberately and
conscientiously believe, will not in any reasonable degree supply
the necessities of the population; it has not nearly done so as
yet under most favourable circumstances. I see no probability
that it can do so in the future. "Without a colonial chaplain or
chaplains there would be to me the insuperable objection that the
fundamental doctrines of the gospel would not be acknowledged by
the Government. . . . I do not wish for any corrupt, secularly
political connection between the Church and State, but I cannot
conceive that any sincere Christian man can be satisfied at being
at the head of a Government which, as a Government, acknowledges
no God and no doctrine.</p>
<p>"I have arrived at a plan which, if it be supported by the
Government and Commissioners, will, I think, be a solid basis for
the best of blessings to the province. It is in abstract
this:&mdash;1. That the provision of the original Act requiring
the appointment of chaplains of the Churches of England and
Scotland should continue to be carried out, but with great
moderation, as an acknowledgment on the part of the Government of
the fundamental doctrines of the Christian faith&mdash;doctrines
common to all really Christian denominations. 2. That for the
maintenance of religion and the furtherance of education in the
colony at large, land for religious and educational purposes
should be sold to all applicants at a very low rate (say
5<i>s</i>. per acre), the property and proceeds of such land to
be legally secured and applied according to the intentions of the
donors."</p>
<p>Nothing could have been more moderate, but it was opposed to
the principle for which so many of the fathers and founders of
the colony had zealously contended, and the appeal had no effect.
A worse thing, however, was to happen to the Dissenters in the
not far distant future, as we shall presently see.</p>
<p>During the years 1839-40, very few English settlers turned
their attention to agricultural pursuits. The high rate of wages,
the dearness of provisions, and the disinclination to grapple
with what really amounted to "bush-life", acted as deterrents,
and the people still clung tenaciously to the city, the suburbs,
and the port, a course which operated most unfavourably against
the development of the agricultural resources of the country. But
during these years the colony was greatly indebted to a large
number of German immigrants, who arrived in the <i>Prince
George</i> in 1838, and at once proceeding to the cultivation of
the land, produced an abundant supply of vegetables for Adelaide,
where there would otherwise have been scarcity.</p>
<p>The story of the circumstances under which these Germans
obtained a footing in South Australia is interesting.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* For a fuller account see "George Fife Angas,
Father and Founder of South Australia", by Edwin Hodder. London,
1891.]</p>
<p>In 1817 the union between the Reformed and Lutheran Churches
in Prussia had nearly everywhere been effected; but the Church
ritual being different in various places, it was thought
desirable to introduce a regulation for uniform worship over the
whole of the evangelical part of the monarchy. Accordingly, in
1822, King Frederick William III. issued a new liturgy,
introduced it by Cabinet order, caused it to be used in the royal
chapel and the garrison churches, and recommended its adoption by
all Protestant communities in the State. But as it clashed in
some doctrinal particulars with the views of a certain portion of
the Lutherans, they felt it to be their duty to withstand the
innovation at all costs. So long, however, as the Government
confined itself to a simple recommendation, the objections raised
against it were not of great importance; but when, in 1825, it
was in contemplation to make the use of the new liturgy
compulsory, a strong agitation began. The Church party, with
Schleiermacher at its head, fought bravely against Auguste,
Marheineche, and others, for the freedom and independence of the
Church, and against the "Agenda" as being the work of the
Government, without the consent of the respective Church
communities.</p>
<p>The quarrel lasted until 1829, when a modified edition of the
liturgy was prepared, and the 25th of June, 1830, was fixed as
the date for its universal introduction.</p>
<p>The principle at stake was held by many to remain unaltered,
and they combined to resist the innovation. This brought upon
them the royal displeasure, and persecution, fines, and
imprisonment followed their disobedience. In Silesia the tyranny
was felt more than elsewhere, and many Lutherans determined, like
the Pilgrim Fathers, to seek some part of the globe where they
might worship God according to the dictates of conscience. To
this end the Rev. Augustus Kavel, minister of the Evangelical
Lutheran Church at Klemzig, having heard of the labours of Mr.
G.F. Angas on behalf of the colony of South Australia, waited
upon him to seek his advice. Mr. Angas was a backbone
Nonconformist, and stood in the front rank of fighters for
religious freedom; his sympathies were at once enlisted, and
after two years of incessant labour, and at an enormous expense,
he finally succeeded, despite the reluctance of the Prussian
Government to grant passports to the emigrants, in sending out to
South Australia some hundreds of these German Lutherans. The
first batch of two hundred, with Pastor Kavel on board, left
Plymouth Sound&mdash;the very harbour from which the Pilgrim
Fathers set sail to lay the foundation of the great Western
Republic&mdash;in the <i>Prince George</i>, and arrived in the
colony in November, 1838. They settled upon some land belonging
to Mr. Angas on the river Torrens, only a short distance from
Adelaide, to which they gave the name of Klemzig, after their
native town in Prussia. Vessel after vessel followed rapidly,
carrying many hundreds to the new Land of Promise, and in course
of time there sprung up the flourishing townships of Angaston,
Blumberg, Greenock, Gr&uuml;nthal, Hahndorf, Lobethal, Lyndoch,
Nairne, Nuriootpa, Rosenthal, and Tanunda, where, at the present
time, many thousands of Germans, as well as English, are
resident.</p>
<p>The thrifty, practical, hard-working Germans soon made their
little wildernesses blossom as the rose, and there is no doubt
that their success inspired others to turn attention to similar
as well as other branches of husbandry and industry.</p>
<p>Activity became the order of the day in every branch of
labour. Wheat, from the ease with which it could be grown, with
the demand there was for it in the Victorian market, and the
large profits it yielded, led many to embark in its cultivation;
some more extensively than their capital warranted, and when bad
and dry seasons set in, they were overtaken with misfortune, and
found their way into the insolvent court. Many, therefore, began
to look out for other sources of income, and it was found that
the climate and soil were equally well adapted for the growth and
production of wine, olive oil, hops, tobacco, and a variety of
other articles required for exportation and home consumption. As
early as 1840 Mr. Struthers cultivated a small quantity of Sea
Island cotton, as an experiment, and it grew remarkably well.</p>
<p>It was believed that nearly all kinds of tropical plants,
trees, fruits, and flowers, as well as those of temperate climes,
could be successfully grown, and when the experiment was tried,
it was found that the apple and the orange, the pear and the
pine-apple, the gooseberry and the fig, the raspberry and the
olive, and many other fruits would come to perfection within a
short distance of each other.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** Fruits come to perfection and are in season

<p>Nearly all kinds of vegetables have been successfully
cultivated, and have attained to almost incredible sizes and
weights, although the raids of insects have always been a source
of unusual trouble.</p>
<p>The year 1841 opened with all the outward and visible signs of
prosperity. The land sales had reached the enormous figure of
299,072 acres (of which, however, only 2503 were under
cultivation); the population had reached sixteen thousand (but of
these an overwhelming percentage were entirely dependent upon the
Government for food or labour, the wherewithal to get food);
immigration was continuing to pour in (although there were many
labourers and few capitalists); Adelaide had thrown off almost
every vestige of her first simplicity. Handsome public buildings,
churches, meeting-houses, prisons, macadamized roads, bridges of
magnificent span connecting the various suburbs of the
picturesquely situated metropolis, custom houses, harbours,
quays, gave the appearance of an almost unlimited revenue. It was
as fine a capital and as complete a Government establishment as
would have been the usual proportion of thirty times the number
of population at home. And everything was done on a complete and
lordly scale&mdash;no jerry-building, no stucco, no veneer. The
prison, "the last of all places in a new colony that some might
suppose needed elaborate architecture, had its high walls and
strong doors; its angle towers surmounted with cutstone
embattlements, the stone alone costing &pound;2 2<i>s</i>. per
cube foot to work, while for other services artificers were paid
from &pound;3 18<i>s</i>. to &pound;4 4<i>s</i>. per week."</p>
<p>It was a grand time; everywhere there was planning and
working, enlarging and improving, demolishing the brick and
raising the marble; it was the old story, eating and drinking,
marrying and giving in marriage, and then&mdash;the deluge!</p>
<p>Rumblings of the coming storm had been heard here and there,
but little heed had been taken. The whole matter was in a
nutshell&mdash;immigration was pouring in with every tide; the
supply was unfortunately in excess of the demand; the immigrants
could not be left to starve; to employ them on work even
unnecessary at the time then present would be for the ultimate
good of the colony, and as to the responsibility&mdash;well, it
must rest on the shoulders of the Commissioners, and if they were
not strong enough to bear it, on those of the Imperial
Government. This was the dream, from which there was to be a rude
awakening.</p>
<p>Early in February, when Governor Gawler was on a visit to Cape
Jervis and Kangaroo Island, tidings reached the colony that some
of the bills drawn by him on the Commissioners had been returned
dishonoured.</p>
<p>The blow, feared and not altogether unexpected, had fallen,
and the utter ruin of the colony seemed inevitable.</p>
<p>Colonel Gawler hastened back, and at once summoned the
Council. They, desperately assuming, or pretending to assume,
that the bills were dishonoured merely because the Commissioners
had not, at the moment, the needful funds in hand to meet them,
and that the whole question was simply a matter of time until the
necessary funds should be forthcoming, recommended, "That the
practice of drawing upon the Colonization Commissioners should be
continued with the precautionary addition of a reference, in case
of need, to the Lords of her Majesty's Treasury."</p>
<p>A little later, and there was another scare. In April a rumour
reached Adelaide indirectly, by way of Tasmania, that Governor
Gawler had been recalled and his successor appointed. The rumour
was not generally credited, although it produced uneasiness in
all quarters.</p>
<p>Shortly after this a despatch was received from the
Commissioners, informing Colonel Gawler that the Board had no
longer any funds to meet the bills that had been sent home, and
that he must discontinue to draw upon them. He at once called the
Council together, and stated that he must adopt one of two
courses, "either at once to reduce the survey, harbour,
immigrant, colonial store, and police departments, and confine
the Government expenditure to the mere Government and judicial
offices, customs, and absolute pauper immigrants which the
revenue may at present support," or "act as every governor of a
British colony is authorized by the instructions of the Colonial
Office to do in case of <i>pressing emergency</i>, draw, in the
capacity of Governor, directly on the Lords of the Treasury for
the sums necessary in reason to preserve the colony, during the
interval described, from disorder, ruin, and destitution." After
giving the subject the most careful consideration, he determined
to adopt, for the time being, the latter course.</p>
<p>The times were critical in the extreme; every individual in
the colony had a personal interest in the questions at issue, and
public meetings to discuss the financial position became the
order of the day. Those held by the Chamber of Commerce were of
the most practical importance, as it was resolved that "should
his Excellency the Governor see fife to draw upon her Majesty's
Treasury, they will accept such bills in payment of their
ordinary business transactions."</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that the responsibility the Governor had
taken upon himself throughout was, in a certain sense,
unauthorized by the Commissioners, and was maintained contrary to
their wish. But he had unbounded faith in the capabilities of the
colony, and never entertained the shadow of a doubt as to a
successful issue of his schemes. So long therefore as the
Commissioners had funds, they yielded to his pressing demands for
additional monetary help, under the conviction, it would seem,
that his confident and sanguine expectations would shortly be
realized and that they would be relieved from the constant drain
on their finances.</p>
<p>In deference to the opinion expressed at certain public
meetings and to instructions received from the Commissioners, the
Governor commenced retrenchment as regarded special land surveys
and the police department, but he had not proceeded far when, on
the 10th of May, the <i>Lord Glenelg</i> arrived, bringing not
only the recall of Colonel Gawler, but also his successor in the
person of Captain Grey!</p>
<p>This was regarded by the friends of the Governor as an
arbitrary and discourteous proceeding, more especially as the
Commissioners, who had placed his conduct in the strongest light
before the Government, had not in any of their despatches
directly censured him, although perfectly aware of the
ever-increasing expenditure. It is true that under date of the
13th of July, 1840, in reply to an application from Colonel
Gawler for an increase in salary from &pound;1000 to &pound;2000
per annum, the Secretary of State (Lord John Russell) had written
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It was not until I was placed in possession of the
Commissioners' report that I was made aware of the actual
embarrassments of the colony. Under the circumstances stated by
the Commissioners, it is obviously impossible to make any
increase in the incomes of the public officers of the colony; and
I regret therefore that I cannot recommend to the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury to sanction the grant of the salary
which you propose." After asking for a report upon the statements
made by the Commissioners, Lord John concluded, "I cannot but
express my surprise and concern at the large expense into which
the colony has been plunged, and I mast earnestly hope that you
will use every endeavour to arrest the difficulties in which it
is placed."</p>
<p>To this despatch, which was not received till December, 1840,
Colonel Gawler made a lengthy and energetic reply, in which he
not only endeavoured to justify his own position, but threw upon
the shoulders of the Commissioners whatever blame was due. "The
Commissioners," he wrote, "were desirous to form a fine colony,
and abstractly they were willing to authorize the measures
necessary to accomplish this end; but I must respectfully say, in
my own defence, that they did not calculate the cost of them, nor
had they any adequate conception of the difficulties arising from
the state and requirements of a new and large community suddenly
collected and planted in an unexplored wilderness."</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;"In all the documents and communications issued
by the Commissioners from the date of my appointment to office
until the report which your lordship has enclosed to me, there
never was the slightest censure passed on any portion of the
expenditure which I had directed. On the contrary, I was
justified by the Commissioners in the greatest items of
expenditure which I had incurred on my own
responsibility&mdash;items which embrace almost all the
extraordinary expenditure of the colony. Therefore I am in no
wise guilty of the heavy charge which the Commissioners have made
against me of 'setting their instructions at naught', but that I
simply stand on my own responsibility for correctness of judgment
as to whether or not the cases referred to were really cases of
emergency. In no other matter have I ever intended in any of my
former official statements to confess responsibility. In speaking
of unauthorized expenditure, I have always supposed it would be
distinctly understood to mean expenditure unauthorized by
detailed instructions. I came to this colony to conduct a great
and first experiment. An experiment of necessity involves the
possibility not only of success but of failure without blame to
those who conduct it faithfully. The experiment in South
Australia embraced two great considerations: (1) the success of
the self-supporting system, and (2) the safety of the colony. I
never doubted but that the safety of the colony was the point to
be first maintained, and until the receipt of a semi-official
letter from Colonel Torrens, dated 17th of June, 1840, and of the
report of your lordship of the 7th of July, 1840, the
instructions and correspondence of the Commissioners with regard
to emergencies gave me the fullest reason to believe that their
view and mine coincided. . . .</p>
<p>"I considered it emergency when the survey department could
not keep pace with the demand; when the police force was not
sufficient to suppress bushrangers and other lawless characters,
to control the natives, and to check contraband trade; emergency,
when public officers of value were leaving their situations on
account of the insufficiency of their salaries, or were trading
and really plundering the Government on what they called
authorized principle; emergency, when the survey and land offices
being burnt down, there was not a public office belonging to the
Government in Adelaide, and none of reasonable permanent
suitableness to be hired; emergency, when, with an immense
pressure of business and harassment of all kinds upon me, I, my
wife, family, secretary, office, and servants, were limited
during the day to a mud cottage, fifty feet by twenty-seven in
extreme dimensions; and emergency, when, with a really beautiful
natural port, commerce was suffering almost indescribable
hindrances from the difficulty of landing in a broad, triangular
swamp. . . . These, in addition to immigrant sickness and
destitution, are the great and leading objects which have been to
my fullest conviction emergencies, and which have absorbed the
greater part of the extraordinary expenditure."</p>
<p>Such were some of the lines of Colonel Gawler's defence, and
whatever estimate may be put upon them, no one will deny that he
acted, from a high sense of the responsibilities attaching to his
office.</p>
<p>"Governor Gawler," says Mr. B.T. Finniss, "did what Imperial
legislation afterwards recognized as a valid employment of the
land fund; that is, he promoted public works, and provided for
the maintenance of the labour, which every Government is bound to
do to guard against destitution. But in doing so, he violated his
instructions and paid the penalty in removal from office with all
its attendant consequences. Whether he was right or wrong, it may
be asserted that the colonists of that period and of the present
owe him a debt of gratitude for saving the colony from anarchy,
and for the improvements in its condition which must have
resulted from an expenditure not wastefully incurred, but spread
amongst the community in the shape of wages for useful purposes.
Governor Gawler was impelled by circumstances to act as he did.
Moreover, his action led to a more practical system of land
legislation, and struck a deathblow to the principle of applying
all the proceeds of all the lands sold and alienated from the
Crown to the introduction of labour." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* "Constitutional History of South
Australia."]</p>
<p>The exact amount of the excess of Colonel Gawler's expenditure
over the revenue and the amount of bills drawn by him upon the
Commissioners was stated to be &pound;291,861 3<i>s</i>.
5&frac12;<i>d</i>. The total debt due in England on the 1st of
May, 1841, and chargeable on the revenue of the colony, was
&pound;305,328 2<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>.!</p>
<p>When the news was received in the colony that the bills were
dishonoured, there was a panic among the merchants who had
purchased the Government paper to a large amount as remittances
to their correspondents in England, and tradesmen and others who
had been working for or supplying articles to the Government
found themselves involved. The distress became general and was
shared by all classes.</p>
<p>"Universal bankruptcy and great distress then prevailed
throughout all Australia, such as had never occurred before or
have been since experienced. The severe fall in land, stock, and
all other property would appear at the present time as almost
incredible. A song was composed and nightly sung, which was
especially applicable to the then circumstances of New South
Wales in describing the troubles of the period, which it did in
the personal lamentations of a luckless individual named 'Billy
Barlow', amongst whose terrible misfortunes was 'the sale of his
sheep at sixpence per head with the run given in'&mdash;a state
of things not so very far from the truth. Emigration from other
countries had ceased. The privations of the settlers were severe,
and everything seemed to be at its lowest. The loss of capital
incurred in founding the colony cannot be estimated, but it must
have been very considerable, inasmuch as nearly all those engaged
in the importation and distribution of merchandise, with many
others, were ruined. A number of persons were in prison for debt,
for whom there were no means of relief. It was found that the
British bankruptcy and insolvency laws did not apply to South
Australia, and so these unfortunate debtors continued in gaol
until the Act for giving relief to insolvent debtors was passed
on the 22nd of June, 1841, and an Insolvent Court was
established, when there soon after followed what might be termed
a 'general gaol delivery' for debtors." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** Sir Henry Ayers, K.C.M.G.]</p>
<p>Much sympathy was felt for Colonel Gawler, and addresses,
testimonials, and other marks of respect and good feeling poured
in upon him from many quarters. When, on the 18th of June, he
took his departure from the colony, he left behind him a memory
which was treasured by many even of those who had suffered most
from the policy he had pursued. Of the wisdom of that policy he
never entertained a moment's doubt. Five years after he had left
South Australia, he wrote to his old friend, Mr. G.F. Angas, in
these terms:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="right"><small>"June 4th, 1846.</small>   </p>
<p>"I laid, in the face of immense difficulties, the foundation
of the finest colony, in proportion to its duration, that has
appeared in modern times. I did so with full purpose and
foresight of beneficial results, and without running the reckless
risks that are attributed to me, and in England have obtained, as
to my policy, nothing but reproaches. It is moreover, I believe,
one of the cheapest, if not the very cheapest of the distant
colonies that England has had. . . . I carried out with full
foresight of results the 'self-supporting system' as far as it
was possible to do it . . . at a cost less than even its original
devisers calculated, for they thought of &pound;375,000 for the
political expenses of foundation (see Wakefield, vol. ii. p.
119), while the net cost of South Australia up to this moment is
short of &pound;300,000. Not, however, that I should desire that
&pound;300,000 to be laid upon the colony. I think it was the
ruining error of the original plan that such a thing should ever
have been contemplated. A parent State ought to pay for her
colonies as a parent does for his children, or as States do
themselves for their lines of battle ships; it is a beggarly
spirit of penury alone which can lead them to fume and grumble as
they have done about South Australia.</p>
<p>"You justly ask, 'Could not the effects have been produced for
a less sum?' I would say not, in reasonable consideration and
under the circumstances of the case and time. A novel system; an
unknown climate; an unexplored country; public officers utterly
inexperienced (some, from ill health or other causes, really
useless&mdash;I mean men in the highest stations); population
flowing in and land selling with fearful rapidity and a rapidity
that the Commissioners were pledged to meet. I was their
representative, a Commissioner under the same sign manual like
themselves, and bound before God and man to maintain in good
faith their engagements. I really laboured most continually and
anxiously for economy, and Mr. Hall and I nearly destroyed
ourselves with unceasing labour."</p>
<p>It was anticipated by many that after he had defended his
actions "at home", Colonel Gawler would be reinstated in his
office in South Australia. But this was not to be, and he
remained an injured and unjustly treated man.</p>
<p>Of the immediate circumstances connected with his recall, and
of the action of the Imperial Government in averting the utter
ruin of the colony, threatened by their returning the bills drawn
upon the Commissioners and the Lords of the Treasury dishonoured,
we shall write more fully in the next chapter.</p>

<p>W<small>HEN</small> it became known to the friends of South
Australia in England that the bills drawn by Colonel Gawler had
been dishonoured, the greatest consternation prevailed. Ruin,
irretrievable ruin as it seemed, stared the insolvent colony in
the face. The Commissioners and the directors of the South
Australian Company were alike terror-stricken. The blow had
fallen with sudden and startling force.</p>
<p>One of the first to take action on behalf of the colony was
Mr. G.F. Angas, the chairman of the South Australian Company, who
wrote to Lord John Russell, Secretary for the Colonies, a
stirring letter, from which the following is an
extract:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="right"><small>"October 24, 1840.</small>   </p>
<p>" . . . It is impossible for me to feel otherwise than greatly
alarmed at the present dangerous position of the new colony, and
the destruction that awaits it when the dishonoured drafts of the
Governor, now under protest for non-acceptance, shall reach
Adelaide in utter disgrace, with twenty per cent. damages for
non-payment. From whatever causes, that colony is at this moment
in a state of advancement and completeness in the fourth year of
its existence, without a parallel in the history of the Empire,
and if it should not continue to progress, the cause of its
obstruction cannot be chargeable upon its inhabitants, or upon
the professed friends of the colony in this country, who have
nobly done their duty in the furtherance of this important
experiment in colonization. Neither in the measures of the
Government nor in the application of the finances have they had
any power whatever, and they cannot understand how it is that
with an unappropriated emigration fund of about &pound;80,000,
and the power given to Her Majesty's Commissioners by the South
Australian Act to raise a loan of &pound;200,000, of which
&pound;120,000 remain untouched, that the Governor's drafts
should have been refused acceptance. Thus, in an instant, the
public credit of the colony has been destroyed, and, if not
restored by a timely interposition of the Government, must end in
anarchy, confusion, and ruin.</p>
<p>"Most happily, the interval between the first presentation of
the drafts and their maturity will afford time for your
lordship's intervention, and the awful consequences of a general
bankruptcy may be averted. Here is a colony, raised up within
four years without trouble or expense to the mother country, with
a population of 16,000 persons, whose seaports have, during the
past few years, admitted about two hundred merchant ships, and
where more than a million of British capital has been embarked,
even at a distance of 14,000 miles. The celebrated colony of
Pennsylvania, at one-third the distance, could not in seven years
number half the population, or a fourth of its commerce."</p>
<p>This, and similar appeals, moved the Government to action. It
was decided to guarantee a loan, and to recommend its adoption by
Parliament, and orders were given to the Commissioners to make
arrangements to meet the dishonoured drafts. A parliamentary
inquiry upon the whole of the affairs of South Australia was to
follow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, punishment was to be meted out to the Governor
whose lavish expenditure, it was said, had brought about all the
mischief, and it was done in a manner as unpleasant as it was
unjust.</p>
<p>Colonel Gawler's recall, dated Downing Street, December 26,
1840, and signed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, was
in these terms:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In consequence of the reports which have been made to her
Majesty's Government by the Colonization Commissioners for South
Australia, respecting the amount of the bills which you have
drawn on the Commissioners in excess of the authority which you
had received from them for that purpose, it has become my
unwelcome duty to advise her Majesty to relieve you from the
office of Governor and her Majesty's Resident Commissioner in
that province. The Queen, having been pleased to approve of that
advice, has appointed as your successor Captain Grey, who will
proceed to South Australia in the vessel that carries this
despatch."</p>
<p>The first official intimation received by Colonel Gawler of
any direct censure of his policy by the Commissioners, or of
dissatisfaction on the part of the Colonial Office, was this curt
recall, and the appearance of Captain Grey at Government House as
his successor!</p>
<p>Upon the appointment of Captain Grey, the management of the
colony by the South Australian Commissioners in London
practically ceased, the home Government taking it entirely into
their own hands.</p>
<p>Apart from the objectionable manner in which it was done, it
is questionable whether any better man could possibly have been
selected than Captain Grey. He was the son of Colonel Grey,
killed at the taking of Badajoz, and was born in Lisbon,
Portugal, on the 14th of April, 1812. Educated at Sandhurst, he
entered the army in 1829, but retired from his profession. From
1837 to 1840, he was employed in exploring the coast of Western
Australia and tracing the sources of the Glenelg River. During
his travels he received a severe spear-wound, which for many
years was a cause of suffering to him. His "Journals of
Discovery" give the romance of Australian exploration, and in an
unobtrusive way reveal his character for courage, perseverance,
and endurance under privation.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* "Explorations in Western and North-Western
Australia", publisher] 1841.]</p>
<p>Before assuming the reins of office, under "the most difficult
and unpopular of all conditions, namely, the necessity of rigid
retrenchment and the task of creating a revenue by the imposition
of increased duties of customs," he determined to have a clear
understanding as to the course he was to pursue generally, and
the support he would receive from the Imperial Government, and he
at once addressed a lengthy minute to the Secretary of State for
the Colonies, his inquiries plainly showing that he was opposed
to the policy of his predecessor, and was resolved to grapple
with the financial difficulties sternly and resolutely. He wished
to be informed whether official correspondence was to be
addressed to the Commissioners, or to the Colonial Secretary;
what was to be the mode of dealing with the different departments
engaged in the receipt and issue of public moneys; what provision
was to be made for paying the interest of the public debt;
whether the system of special surveys was to be continued, and,
if so, upon what principle; whether the public buildings in
course of erection should be completed or not; whether, as the
Government House was far too vast for his residence "without
extreme imprudence", he would be at liberty to appropriate it to
some public object, and hire a smaller house as a residence; and
then followed a string of queries as to salaries of Government
officers (his own included), the creation of corporate bodies,
and the employment of troops to do public duty, and to relieve
the colony of this heavy item of expenditure.</p>
<p>To many of the inquiries Lord John Russell was unable to give
direct replies; on others, however, he was definite and explicit.
Thus: "It will be proper that you should address yourself to the
Secretary of State on all questions relating to the legislative
and executive duties of your Government; and, further, that under
the existing circumstances of the colony, and until you receive
further instructions, you shall communicate directly with me
generally on all questions of finance. I will then make such
communications as may be necessary on the subject of your
despatches to the Colonization Commissioners." No objection was
raised to the sale or letting of public buildings not actually
required for the real exigencies of the public service, due care
being taken not to alienate any buildings which might in the near
future be required for such service, but all public outlay on
buildings in course of erection was to be suspended, except in so
far as might be necessary to prevent dilapidations. The hire of a
smaller house for the Governor could only be allowed if
accommodation could not be obtained in such of the public
buildings as were to be retained and could not be disposed of. In
reply to another query, Lord John said, "I entirely approve of
the measure which you propose of creating corporate bodies,
whether municipal or otherwise, and of investing them with the
power of imposing rates and assessments, of levying wharfage and
other duties with the view of relieving the public revenues, and
of devolving, as far as possible, on the inhabitants of the towns
and of the rural districts, the management and the charge of
their concerns; "and, finally, the Lords of the Treasury
concurred with Lord John Russell, that "no prospect of increase
to the rate of salary at present assigned for the government of
South Australia could be held out to Captain Grey."</p>
<p>The Commissioners being still a constituted body, possessing
certain powers conferred by Act of Parliament, were allowed to
have their say in reply to these inquiries, but foreseeing that
their days were numbered, and that the colony would soon be
placed under the entire care and control of the Crown, they did
not press for their rights and privileges in the matter of
official correspondence, while all questions relating to finance
they were only too glad to leave to "my lords". With regard to
Government House, if Lord John thought the Governor should not
retain it for his residence, they suggested "that it might
perhaps be expedient to dispose of the house to the Corporation
of Adelaide for a Court House or Town Hall, should it be suitable
for that purpose," adding, "it is not impossible that the
Corporation might offer such a price as would cover the expense
of the erection of the house."</p>
<p>This was only one of innumerable instances in which the utter
incompetency of Commissioners in England to arrange and settle
affairs in the distant colonies was shown. Little did those good
gentlemen, seated in their armchairs in a snug board-room,
imagine when they made their suggestion that the Corporation of
Adelaide would soon be found in a state of insolvency, and that
the messenger would seize the few chairs and tables belonging to
that august body in part payment of his salary!</p>
<p>On the 10th of May, 1841, when as yet Colonel Gawler had
received no official intimation of his recall. Captain Grey
arrived in the <i>Lord Glenelg</i>, having been gazetted as
Governor and Resident Commissioner on the previous 18th of
December.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** "Thus at the early age of twenty-eight," says
his biographer, "George Grey left England as the ruler of her
youngest colony, himself the youngest Governor ever appointed to
a similar position."]</p>
<p>Captain Grey, on his arrival in the colony, was kindly
entertained by Colonel Gawler, and on the 15th of May took the
oaths of office in front of Government House.</p>
<p>He began his career in the colony without any ostentation, as
one who knew well that he had difficulties and annoyances of no
ordinary kind to grapple with, and who had determined to exercise
the strictest possible economy compatible with the efficiency of
the public service and the state of the colony. From the first
his trumpet gave no uncertain sound. He was opposed to any kind
of extravagance in an infant settlement, and of course,
therefore, he deprecated the policy of his predecessor. He
maintained that in the early stage of a colony, as there were no
producers either of the necessaries of life or of articles of
export, a large outlay upon extensive public buildings and town
improvements was of no further benefit to the colony than that
those buildings and improvements were obtained, and that the
whole of the money expended in labour was carried out of the
colony to purchase food and clothing.</p>
<p>Moreover, as the colony was thus altogether dependent upon
imports, and as the Government was monopolizing the labour
market, the country settlers stood no chance of carrying on
agricultural operations, their capital being eaten up by the high
price of wages and of the necessaries of life. Disappointed
agriculturists were, therefore, compelled to abandon their
legitimate occupations and betake themselves to speculation in
land and buildings, and instead of assisting the general
prosperity, only hastened the inevitable ruin.</p>
<p>These facts had been fully and lamentably illustrated in the
experience of South Australia, and the task of evolving order out
of the universal chaos was the herculean task of Captain Grey.
His first step was directed to obtaining exact information as to
all claims upon the colonial Government and the Colonization
Commissioners, in the hope that "he would shortly receive
instructions from the Secretary of State, which would enable him
to make the necessary arrangements for their liquidation."
Meanwhile, the question how to procure funds for carrying on the
Government was a burning one.</p>
<p>The estimated expenditure for the first quarter of his
administration was &pound;32,000, to which had to be added nearly
&pound;3000 due for Colonel Gawler's last quarter in office.
Towards meeting this sum there was only &pound;700 in the hands
of the treasurer, and with the revenue decreasing and the land
sales falling off considerably, there seemed little prospect of
raising anything like a revenue to meet even the ordinary
expenditure, to say nothing of a further sum of about
&pound;35,000, the amount of the outstanding claims. Nor, owing
to the state of the times, was there, as Captain Grey had hoped,
any chance of selling the elaborate new premises built for the
Government by Colonel Gawler.</p>
<p>In his extremity Captain Grey applied to the bank for a loan,
but as he was only offered &pound;10,000, and that at twelve per
cent. interest on his personal security, he resolved not to
attempt the liquidation of any debts contracted by his
predecessor until the result of the parliamentary inquiry into
the affairs of the colony should be announced.</p>
<p>Meanwhile retrenchment must be made at once, but it was
difficult to know where to begin, and the task was in any case an
unpleasant one. The Great Eastern Road through Glen Osmond * was
then in course of formation, and he proposed to stop the works;
but against this step there was an instant remonstrance in the
form of a memorial and the inevitable public meeting.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Named after Mr. Osmond Gilles.]</p>
<p>The discontinuance of the signals on West Terrace was another
grievance; so was the increased rate on postage, and a tax of a
penny on newspapers; but the most formidable discontent was on
the part of the labouring classes. The Governor had addressed a
letter to the bench of magistrates, asking them to take into
consideration the position of such immigrants as were unable to
obtain work other than that which the Government was obliged to
provide for them, and to give their opinion as to the
remuneration to be given to those immigrants with whom a
stipulation had been made, that in the event of their being
unable to obtain work elsewhere, the Government would employ them
at reduced wages.</p>
<p>The magistrates met and passed a series of resolutions in
which the practice of inducing the labouring population to hover
in and about the town was deprecated on the one hand, while on
the other the magistrates considered that the Government was
bound to afford them such means of subsistence as would put them
above want. They recommended, as an adequate Government
allowance, seven shillings a week for a single man, ten and
sixpence for a man arid his wife, and for every unemployed child
in the family, up to three inclusive, two and sixpence each per
week; that all immigrants employed by the Government should be
obliged to work daily, including Saturday, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
deducting one hour for breakfast and another for dinner. During
the winter months&mdash;May, June, July, and August&mdash;the
hours to be from seven to five o'clock. It was further
recommended that, in the event of any immigrant refusing from a
settler employment at the rate of &pound;20 per annum and
rations, or any man and his wife refusing &pound;30 and rations,
they should be struck off from Government employment and not be
taken on again.</p>
<p>These recommendations the Governor adopted, and the usual
outcry arose, followed by public meetings, memorials, and
deputations. To these succeeded the formation of organizations
for self-protection, and a resolute determination not to accept
the terms of the Government. But while the agitation was being
kept up, the resources of the people were steadily going down,
and distress, at the worst season of the year, became very
general. In proportion as the Governor remained firm the
dissatisfaction of the people increased, until on more than one
occasion an outbreak was anticipated, which, in the absence of
any military force, might have been serious. At one time several
hundred men, in an organized body, marched to Government House
and threatened the Governor with personal violence, but his
firmness and coolness had the effect of quelling the
disturbance.</p>
<p>Captain Grey had an advantage over his predecessor in this
respect, that he was instructed to act, in all matters connected
with the revenue and expenditure of the colony, in concert with
the members of the Legislative Council, who were to share with
him the responsibility of their action.</p>
<p>About the middle of July intelligence was received in the
colony that a Select Committee of the House of Commons had been
appointed, upon the motion of Lord John Russell, to consider the
Acts relating to South Australia and the actual state of the
colony. The committee was composed as follows:&mdash;Lord Howick,
Lord Stanley, Sir George Grey, Mr. W.E. Gladstone, Mr. G.W. Wood,
Lord Mahon, Mr. J. Parker, Lord Eliot, Mr. Ward, Captain A'Court,
Mr. Vernon Smith, Mr. Raikes Currie, Mr. Sotheron, Lord Fitzalan,
Mr. George Hope, and Sir William Molesworth.</p>
<p>The first report of the committee was brought up in March, and
it was recommended that "provision ought to be made to meet the
actual engagements incurred under the authority of the Resident
Commissioner and the Commissioners appointed under the Act 4
Will. IV. c. 95, and to repay the sums due to the Emigration
Fund; and that such provision should not be delayed until after
this committee shall have completed the inquiry in which it is
engaged into the South Australian Acts and the general state and
prospects of the colony."</p>
<p>A few days later the further news reached the colony that the
British Parliament had, upon the motion of Lord John Russell,
voted the sum of &pound;155,000 for South Australia, and that it
was henceforth to be considered and treated as a Crown
colony.</p>
<p>In moving this vote Lord John said&mdash;</p>
<p>"In proposing that Parliament should relieve the colony from
its present financial embarrassments it was not perhaps necessary
that he should state his opinions as to the manner in which the
colony should be in future governed, but he had no hesitation in
stating that he thought the principles of government which were
applied to the other colonies should be applied to the colony of
South Australia. That, making what provisions they thought proper
with respect to the sale of land and the application of money
derived therefrom, the provisions which placed the government of
the colony in the hands of Commissioners, and directed that the
whole of the expenses of the colony should be defrayed by their
orders, and not by the Treasury, should be repealed so as to
bring the colony into the same state as other colonies with
regard to its government; that if the Crown was to do anything
for the colony, the responsible ministers of the Crown should
have a more direct control; that the Governor appointed by the
Crown should correspond, not with the Commissioners, but with the
Secretary of State and the Government; and with respect to the
financial question, that when the Governor should write home, his
application should be referred to the Treasury, and that their
opinion, as well as that of the Secretary of State, should be
taken before the directions of the Government were sent out. For
himself he could see no good&mdash;indeed, he could see nothing
but mischief&mdash;in that anomalous kind of government in which
the Crown had a nominal direction, yet, in fact, left everything
to the Commissioners, whilst the Commissioners felt bound by the
Act of Parliament, so that neither could be considered as
responsible. If the committee thought it proper that the colony
of South Australia should govern itself, and that the persons
there should have a representative constitution, although he
confessed that that was not his opinion, he should feel no
insuperable objection to it. He should feel that it would in
time, though perhaps not until after a considerable time had
elapsed, struggle through its difficulties and obtain
considerable prosperity."</p>
<p>The second report of the Select Committee of the House of
Commons reached South Australia in November. In it the committee
called attention to certain fundamental defects in the South
Australian Act, namely&mdash;</p>
<p>1. That the provisions of the Act were to be carried into
effect by a Board of Commissioners, the members of which were to
be appointed and removed by the Crown, but over whose movements
the responsible members of the Crown could exercise no adequate
control. 2. The inconvenient division of authority. "While one
department," it was said, "was made responsible for the payment
of the colonial debt, another had the management of the fund out
of which it was to be paid, and whilst one was responsible for
conducting the public service the money by means of which it was
to be conducted was placed under the control of another. If the
revenues of the colony were mismanaged by the local Government
the Commissioners could not satisfy the public creditor; if the
funds raised on the security of those revenues were mismanaged by
the Commissioners the Government could not conduct the public
service," and so on. 3. The uncertainty of the mode prescribed by
the Act for obtaining the supplies on which the colony in its
earlier years was entirely to depend. 4. The inadequate provision
for securing the mother country against any loss which might
eventually arise.</p>
<p>With regard to the administration of affairs by Colonel
Gawler, the committee were of opinion that "the condition of the
colony on his arrival made it absolutely necessary that he should
assume a large responsibility in deviating from his
instructions," and they "entertain no doubt that Colonel Gawler
was actuated in the course which he pursued by the most earnest
desire to advance the interests and promote the prosperity of the
country, nor can they undertake to state to what extent he may
have been justified by imperative necessity in involving the
colony in an expenditure so far exceeding his authority." "But,"
continued the report, "it is due to Colonel Gawler to observe
that the general character of his administration has been spoken
of in terms of strong approval, even by those who have censured
his expenditure as excessive, and that, among the witnesses
examined, even those who have pronounced this censure most
decidedly have been unable to point out any specific items by
which it could have been considerably reduced without great
public inconvenience."</p>
<p>The committee considered that the arrangements of the late
Board of Commissioners had proved in many material points
defective; that their instructions as to expenditure, "though
minutely and elaborately drawn up, appear to have been framed
without any clear foresight of the necessities of such a
community placed in such circumstances, and on an estimate of the
charges to be incurred and the objects to be provided for totally
inadequate and bearing no proportion to the reality."</p>
<p>It was, however, distinctly stated in the report that the
committee would be "doing injustice to the individuals upon whom
the responsibility for the management of these affairs had fallen
did they not add their opinion that the chief and original error
was committed in the Act itself."</p>
<p>The gracefulness of this encomium was considerably discounted
by a subsequent remark: "That the Commissioners have been
unsuccessful in the execution of their charge is less a matter of
surprise than that they should have entertained no apprehension
of the result which has taken place, and that up to the
termination of their official connection with the colony in 1840
they should have apparently conceived that the experiment was
advancing to a successful issue."</p>
<p>Many of the measures recommended by the committee were
subsequently embodied in a Bill passed on the 15th of July, 1842,
entitled, "An Act for the Better Government of the Province of
South Australia."</p>
<p>Under the impression that the recommendations of the Select
Committee would be speedily carried into effect, Captain Grey
felt confident himself, and endeavoured to inspire confidence in
the colonists, that all claims would in the near future be
settled. In addition to those due in England, he had found that
there were considerable sums due in the colony, and he felt it to
be his duty to commence paying off these, so that Government
creditors in the colony might not be worse off there than
elsewhere&mdash;a step cordially approved, not only by the
Council, but also by the Chamber of Commerce. Accordingly, and
without express authority, he drew bills upon her Majesty's
Treasury, and in a despatch to Lord John Russell justified his
actions in these words:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="right"><small>"November 14th, 1841.</small>   </p>
<p>" . . . A great deal of distress necessarily resulted from the
non-payment of these bills, and this was more severely felt from
the limited nature of the mercantile community in this province.
The situation of these Government creditors was also peculiar.
They had seen the supplies furnished by them appropriated to the
uses of the Government; a pledge had been given to them which
neither the late Governor nor myself had yet fulfilled, and they
were not even in so good a position as the holders of the bills;
if they had been so their claims would have been settled at the
same time as those of the other creditors in England. When,
therefore, I ascertained that all the bills drawn by Colonel
Gawler were in course of payment in England, and found that had
Colonel Gawler drawn bills for these precisely similar claims
remaining unpaid in the colony, that then the creditors here
would have been placed in the same position as those elsewhere;
when also I saw the distress which the non-payment of those
accounts was creating, I felt that I should be no longer
justified in refraining from putting all the Government creditors
upon an equal footing. I, accordingly, have commenced drawing
drafts upon the Lords of the Treasury for the payment of these
outstanding claims, and I trust that the line of policy I have
pursued may meet with the approbation of her Majesty's
Government."</p>
<p>But "my lords" did not approve, as we shall see later on.</p>
<br>
<p>Apart from financial matters, there were many notable events
to claim the serious attention of Governor Grey during the first
year of his administration.</p>
<p>On the 21st of April news reached Adelaide that a ferocious
attack had been made by about 300 to 400 natives on an overland
party, led by Mr. Inman, about forty miles from Lake. Bonney. It
was stated that the leader of the party and two shepherds had
been speared and the sheep scattered. Major O'Halloran, the
commissioner of police, was at once despatched to the scene of
the affray with a body of mounted police, and accompanied by a
surgeon to render assistance if necessary. Happily, there had
been no loss of life, and the party had escaped to the nearest
station.</p>
<p>On his return to Adelaide, Major O'Halloran left a corporal
and four mounted troopers near the Great Bend for the protection
of a party shortly expected overland, who had started from Mr.
Dutton's station for the purpose of rescuing, if possible, the
sheep belonging to Mr. Inman's party. They soon fell in with the
natives, who approached to within fifty yards of them, when one
of the leaders gave the signal of attack, by striking a spear
into the ground and waving his hand. In an instant the war-cry
was raised and the affray began. "The first man who threw a spear
I shot through the head," says one of the party, "and gave the
order to fire, hoping that when they saw two or three of the
natives fall they would have retreated; but they did not appear
in the slightest degree intimidated, but still advanced in the
form of a crescent in a body of at least two hundred, while many
more were partially seen in the thick part of the scrub. At this
time, Mr. George Hawker called out to me that they were
encircling us, and seeing that they were advancing both wings
while the centre was engaged, a large lagoon being in our rear, I
ordered the party to follow me and outflank them on the right.
While effecting this, Mr. G. Hawker's horse fell over a tree, and
he was dismounted; we wheeled round to protect him, and about
this time Mr. John Jacob's horse received a second spear-wound
and was soon unable to carry him further. He dismounted, and we
were all engaged in covering his retreat, at the same time moving
towards a dry creek, on the further side of which was rising
ground. We succeeded in reaching this, and formed in line while
Mr. Jacob mounted behind Mr. Edward Bagot. The affray had now
lasted more than half an hour, and I directed the party to
retreat in order. There were very few shots fired without effect,
and the last man shot was one of their chiefs. Had not the
gentlemen of the party displayed much steadiness and coolness Mr.
Jacob must have fallen, as it was by frequently coming to the
'present', but reserving our fire, that we kept the headmost men
back, as on these occasions they adroitly double themselves up
into the smallest possible compass, holding a shield before their
heads. In covering Mr. Jacob's retreat a spear struck me in the
fore part of the head, but as it passed through a thick tarpaulin
hat, the wound was but slight; but the mare on which I rode was
speared through the shoulder. When I was struck the natives gave
a yell of triumph, as they did on every occasion when the
advantage appeared to be on their side. Having retreated about a
mile, we were obliged to halt to sew up the wound in my mare's
shoulder, or she must soon have dropped from loss of blood; then,
choosing the clearest ground, we joined our cart on the following
day. I felt convinced that the sheep remaining were not far
distant, and that the natives had assembled for the purpose of
defending them; and it is my opinion that it would take a very
large party to subdue them without loss of life, as their great
activity and courage, combined with their numbers and the
difficult character of that part of the country for horse
attacks, render them a much more formidable enemy than the
colonists have any idea of."</p>
<p>This report, typical of many, caused some stir in Adelaide.
Another party being expected overland, Major O'Halloran, with a
body of troopers, was again sent out to the locality. A large
number of gentlemen volunteered their services and were sworn in
as special constables, the funds of the local Government being
altogether inadequate to pay for the protection of overland
parties. They started, sixty-eight in all, on the 31st of May,
and soon after their arrival at the Murray fell in with the
expected overlanders. And a sorry lot they were. Only two days
before, they had been attacked by the natives; four of their
number bad been killed and two wounded out of a party of sixteen,
twenty head of cattle had been dispersed, others killed, and all
their property and supplies filched. Meanwhile, the natives had
cleared off; carcases of about a thousand slain sheep were lying
about in heaps, but no living sheep could be found.</p>
<p>At one place a striking incident occurred. Some of the party
came upon the body of a man with his faithful dog standing beside
him, which, as the party approached, set up a pitiful wail. The
poor animal itself was found to have been speared in two places,
and it was concluded that it had bravely attacked the natives in
the affray. The body of the unfortunate man, over whom the
wounded dog had faithfully kept guard for two days, was found to
be in a dreadfully mangled and lacerated condition, and the whole
scene where the conflict had taken place was described by Major
O'Halloran as a horrifying one.</p>
<p>All efforts to capture the natives were, owing to the
facilities for escape offered by the nature of the country, found
to be unavailing, but the expedition had nevertheless been
fruitful; fifty-three out of seventy head of cattle were
recovered, and seven hundred and ten saved from loss, while
twelve men were rescued from inevitable death.</p>
<p>On several other occasions during the year outrages were
committed by the natives, each fresh instance giving rise to
increased uneasiness. In one of the attacks between thirty and
forty of the natives were killed, and this led to a careful
consideration by a full bench of magistrates of the whole
subject. They recommended that an armed force should be placed at
the ferry near to which the attacks were made, for the protection
of overland parties. This was agreed to, and shortly afterwards a
permanent police station was established at Morrundee, on the
Murray, and Mr. E.J. Eyre, the experienced traveller, was
appointed resident magistrate. To him was entrusted the difficult
task of conciliating the natives, and of establishing, if
possible, friendly relations between them and the intruding
Europeans. He was furnished by the Government with, provisions
and blankets for distribution, and these were given once a month
to the most deserving. For three years he resided at Morrundee,
and during this time not a single case of serious aggression,
either on the persons or property of the Europeans, occurred. He
visited alone the most distant and hostile tribes, where, but a
short time previously, large and well-armed bodies of Europeans
could not pass uninterruptedly or in safety; and in many
instances the natives showed him considerable kindness and
attention, accompanying him as guides and interpreters,
introducing him from one tribe to another, and explaining the
amicable relations he wished to establish. Influence amounting to
authority was obtained by treating them with uniform kindness,
and this was demonstrated on one occasion in Adelaide, when a
large body of the Murray natives collected to fight those from
Encounter Bay. The Government directed Mr. Eyre to use his
influence to prevent the affray, and he at once proceeded to
their <i>wurleys</i> ** and requested them to leave without
delay, and return to their own district, ninety miles away. In
the course of a few hours, not a native was left in Adelaide, and
the encounter was averted.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Native name for bush-huts.]</p>
<p>It was much to be regretted that in 1844, owing to a
misapprehension by the Government of the wish of Mr. Eyre, he was
released from an office he had so ably fulfilled, and that the
successful experiment at Morrundee was abandoned, and the post
made little better than a mere police-station.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the native schools established by the Government in
the park-lands at Adelaide and at Walkerville were making some
progress; the children were apt to learn, took kindly to their
trousers and shirts, or grey woollen frocks, and, so long as they
could be kept away from the huts or wurleys of their elders, were
teachable and contented. But the natural desire for a wandering
and savage life could not be eradicated, and as the children
advanced in years, they broke away from the restraints of school
life, and plunged once again into the depths of the forest.</p>
<p>A typical case was that of "Nancy", who, after receiving
instruction in the three R's, resided for several years at
Government House in the capacity of a servant. She was always
well dressed, spoke English fluently, and regularly attended a
place of worship. But, after enjoying the comforts of civilized
life, and the confidence and society of all in the establishment,
she suddenly, without any apparent or sufficient reason, left her
situation, returned to her tribe and, to a great extent, to her
primitive mode of life.</p>
<p>It was mainly for the purpose of overcoming this tendency to
revert to barbarism that Archdeacon Hale (afterwards Bishop of
Perth, Western Australia) resolved to attempt the establishment
of a native institution in some locality situated as far as
possible from the centres of European population, and also at a
distance from the usual haunts of the aborigines; but there was
no practical outcome of this scheme until some years later.</p>
<p>Up to 1844 the general results of the previous experiments in
teaching native children may be summed up as follows:&mdash;(1)
That they possessed capacity for learning not inferior to the
best class of European children to be found anywhere in a mixed
community; (2) that they were eager to be instructed, and were
easily kept at their school work except when parental influence
was brought to bear upon predisposing inclinations; (3) that,
apart from this influence, there was the probability that their
vagrant habits might be overcome, and that they would cheerfully
and voluntarily engage in industrial pursuits; (4) that an
interesting field for religious instruction had been opened,
which would amply repay the labours of zealous missionaries.</p>
<br>
<p>One event, trifling in itself, but interesting to South
Australians, as it became a standard topic of conversation for
many years, occurred in the early part of Captain Grey's
administration, and may be mentioned here in passing.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, the 24th of February, a large number of
persons assembled at the port in a state of considerable
excitement, a rumour having gone abroad that an expedition was
being fitted out for the seizure of a French vessel in St.
Vincent's Gulf. The vessel in question was the <i>Ville de
Bordeaux</i>, which a few days previously had arrived in Holdfast
Bay, the captain reporting that he had come from King George's
Sound to take in sheep, but declined to produce satisfactory
papers to Mr. Anthony, the boarding officer at Glenelg, or to Mr.
Torrens, the collector of customs. It was, therefore, determined
not to allow the sheep to be taken, and Mr. Anthony was sent on
board for this purpose. The captain, after abusing and
threatening him, set sail, boarding officer and all, across the
gulf. The collector at once determined to start in pursuit, and
the steamer <i>Courier</i>, the only one in the harbour, was
requisitioned. As there was no coal at hand, shingles, palings,
anything that would serve for fuel, was thrown on board to enable
the little vessel to get up steam with all possible speed, and
amid great excitement and not a little consternation, the
<i>Courier</i>, with the collector on board, left the wharf on
what appeared to be a very hazardous mission.</p>
<p>A war with France had for some time been thought probable, and
if the French vessel in the gulf were really captured, a
collision between France and England was deemed by the excited
colonists inevitable.</p>
<p>But the sailing of the "Shingle Expedition", as it was
afterwards called, was only a three days' wonder. The crew of the
Frenchman refused to obey the captain's orders, took the ship
into their own hands, squared the yards, and stood back up the
gulf, bringing the vessel safely to anchor in Holdfast Bay
without the intervention of the <i>Courier</i>. But the matter
did not end here. As the officers of customs had been obstructed
in the execution of their duty, and the cost of the expedition
was &pound;800, a criminal information was laid against the
captain of the Frenchman. The trial extended over two or three
days, and resulted in a verdict justifying the collector of
customs in holding the ship as a condemned vessel, the owners
being permitted to come into court and try the legality of the
forfeiture and condemnation. This was done in the following year,
and after various applications, trials, hearings, and a reference
to the Court of Appeals, the vessel was finally ordered to be
forfeited.</p>
<p>For many years this fine ship lay quietly moored in the stream
in charge of a custom-house officer, but was subsequently
appropriated to the purposes of a lightship at the outer entrance
of the harbour.</p>
<p>The year 1841 will ever remain memorable in the history of
South Australia. It witnessed the greatest reverses it was almost
possible for the colony to experience. At its commencement nearly
every branch of industry, trade, and commerce appeared to be in a
flourishing condition. Companies, societies, and institutions
sprang rapidly into existence; exports of colonial produce and
samples of minerals had been sent to Britain; great progress had
been made in agriculture and horticulture; the country districts
round about the capital had received many settlers; a fairly good
harvest had been gathered in. Notwithstanding all these and many
other signs of progress and prosperity, at a stroke the condition
of the colony became one of absolute insolvency. As the tide of
misfortune set in, bankruptcy became a matter of frequent
occurrence, and brought to light, in a few cases, some very
reckless and fraudulent transactions, with which the non-payment
of the Governor's bills had nothing to do except to reveal them.
The almost unlimited and indiscriminate credit given by
merchants, who in their turn were mostly agents for English
houses, presented a fine opening for adepts at fraud, and even
gave novices an unusual chance of success. These cases quite
perplexed the officers of the Insolvent Court, as well as the
unfortunate creditors, inasmuch as several of the defaulters,
seeing that the end of their palmy days was at hand, had
carefully laid aside certain assets for contingencies, including
the necessary funds for a bolt to Sydney or elsewhere by a
favourite clipper, the <i>Dorset</i>. So successful were these
bolters that few of them were captured, and, in fact, few efforts
were put forth for that purpose.</p>
<p>Although the Governor had given his confident assurance that
the debts of the colony would ultimately be paid, and had
afforded temporary relief through the bills drawn upon her
Majesty's Treasury, many leading merchants were completely
paralyzed by the sudden check which trade and commerce had
sustained. Large numbers of the working classes, dissatisfied
with the low rate of wages obtainable, either left the colony or
fell back upon the Government alternative in preference to
seeking employment in the country districts. Several tradesmen
and mechanics, who had sufficient means left to pay their
passage-money, proceeded to the then recently established colony
of Kew Zealand. As early as May, sixteen prisoners for debt
petitioned the Governor to have a Bill prepared for their relief,
some of them having suffered from protracted incarceration, and
there being at that time no Act for regulating the imprisonment
of insolvent debtors. A Bill was accordingly prepared, and during
the first six months after it came into operation thirty-six
insolvent debtors availed themselves of the benefit of the
Act.</p>
<p>The widespread prevalence of distress and destitution led some
benevolent colonists to establish a society to assist in
relieving the wants of those suddenly overtaken by misfortune,
and "The South Australian Philanthropic Association" was
instrumental in effecting much good, especially in cases where
Government aid was greatly needed, but had not been sought.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the year, nearly two thousand men, women,
and children in destitute circumstances were being supported at
the expense of the Government.</p>
<p>But with all the distress there was peace, and the public
press of the colony even grew jocular over misfortunes, for when
Foundation Day (28th of December) came round one of the journals
said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Considering our present state, and the improvidence which our
useless consumption of gunpowder would involve, perhaps the
noisier modes of celebration were wisely omitted, while those so
peculiarly appropriate at the present moment&mdash;the closing of
the banks and public offices&mdash;were as widely retained."</p>
<p>The year 1842 was, from beginning to end, a year of trial and
discontent. Of the four newspapers in existence at the beginning
of the year, only one was in any way favourable to the Governor
and his administration. Despondency was the prevailing tone. One
writer, in drawing a comparison between the 1st of January, 1841,
and the corresponding date in 1842, said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Then bankruptcy and insolvency were almost unknown&mdash;they
were rare exceptions to the rule of prosperity; now they are
themselves the rule and their opposite the exception; then the
plough and the spade were busy in all directions; the merchant
was a man of business, not of leisure; the counter of the
storekeeper was thronged, and able-bodied labourers were for the
most part employed. Now, 'the ruin, destitution, and dispersion',
apparently foreseen by Governor Gawler, are here and in full
activity."</p>
<p>In another despairing journal the question "Shall we
re-emigrate?" was fully discussed; but the conclusion arrived at
was that it was better for the colonists to bear the ills they
had than fly to others that they knew not of. Certainly vexations
arose in every conceivable quarter. Such progress had been made
in the survey department, under the able superintendence of
Captain Frome, that all the special surveys claimed&mdash;namely,
thirty-six of four thousand acres each&mdash;had been completed,
and the quantity of land open for selection amounted to upwards
of three hundred thousand acres; but just when this
long-waited-for land was ready for sale there were few who had
either money to buy or confidence to invest in it. Unquestionably
the times were bad in other respects, and the spirit of
discontent and dissatisfaction was so great that, in the absence
of business and more profitable employment, public meetings and
other demonstrations for the ventilation of grievances became the
order of the day, the Chamber of Commerce taking the lead in
these gatherings and inviting the colonists to meet and
deliberate upon the financial position of the colony.</p>
<p>There was a curious misapprehension in some quarters as to the
real cause of the embarrassment. The case was simply this: the
rapid expenditure in the early days suddenly ceased at the very
moment when the colony was most in need of such support. Since
its foundation, five years previously, the local Government had
expended between &pound;400,000 and &pound;500,000; the South
Australian Company had invested an equal amount; the colonists
had imported and expended upwards of a million; and the whole of
this rapid and enormous expenditure stopped at the end of 1840.
Capitalists ceased to come to the colony, and, worst of all, the
colony lost its credit with the mother country. Hence the
disastrous position. Depression in every article of merchandise
and every kind of colonial property followed, and sixteen
thousand persons were plunged in more or less of distress, which
could be alleviated only by assistance from without, that is to
say, the importation of capital into the colony.</p>
<p>In the press, and at public meetings, it was stated that the
operations of agriculture were clogged almost to cessation; that,
the merchants only existed by sufferance of the banks and large
companies; that the profitless pursuits of tradesmen were daily
terminating in insolvency; that labourers were seeking other
shores, or were sunk into the condition of pauperism; and that
hundreds of families, not belonging to either of the
before-mentioned classes, found that they had exchanged wholesome
abundance in England for a bare and precarious subsistence in the
colony.</p>
<p>And yet there was scarcely any step taken by the Governor and
his Council for the improvement of affairs that did not meet with
the opposition of the colonists! To increase the revenue, bills
were passed imposing additional dues on the shipping visiting the
port, and to protect the customs duties by preventing private
distillation. There could be no doubt that it was desirable to
discountenance as far as possible the import of those things
which the colony could itself produce, but it was questionable
whether it was wise to levy such high charges as would
practically prohibit the importation of merchandise.* A meeting
to protest was held in the Queen's Theatre, when it was stated
that whereas formerly the charges on a vessel of live hundred
tons were &pound;10, under the new dues they were raised to
&pound;50. The imposition of high duties on spirits was also
considered "to be opposed to the public interests."</p>
<p class="foot">[* It was however, very much a matter of
"Hobson's choice", and the duties were temporarily imposed as the
only available means of obtaining ready money.]</p>
<p>Soon after this a reduction was made in the port charges, but
not enough to satisfy those connected with the shipping interest;
and later in the year the City Council took the unconstitutional
course of drawing up a petition to her Majesty, for presentation
through the Governor, praying for a disallowance of the Acts
imposing the obnoxious rates and taxes. At the same time, a
memorial was presented to the Governor, praying him to suspend
the operation of those Acts until her Majesty's pleasure became
known.</p>
<p>To the latter request Captain Grey replied&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have been in no slight degree surprised to find that the
Corporation, who have shown themselves so jealous for the
preservation of the British constitution, should have solicited
me to suspend certain laws, and thereby set all the principles of
that constitution at defiance. A moment's consideration should
have sufficed to show the Corporation that a Governor has no
power to suspend the operation of the laws. . . ."</p>
<p>Throughout the year the Governor had been incurring great
responsibilities by drawing on the Treasury for such sums as he
considered necessary, without knowing what the consequences might
be. These responsibilities were largely increased in August. He
received instructions from the Colonial Office that, in the
present critical state of affairs, all the unemployed labourers
in the colony were to be sent forthwith to Sydney. This was
regarded, not only by the Governor, but by nine-tenths of the
people, as impolitic to the last degree; and, on the receipt of a
numerously signed memorial praying him to prevent this great loss
to the colony, he at once took upon himself the responsibility of
disregarding the instruction, and also of continuing to draw on
the British Treasury. With the example and fate of his
predecessor before his eyes, this was even a bolder stroke than
his unauthorized payment of the claims upon the local Government,
and a general feeling of uneasiness took possession of men's
minds. Colonel Gawler throughout all his dashing career carried
the people with him and enjoyed their confidence and sympathy,
but Captain Grey had not this advantage; his policy was unpopular
in all quarters. Every step he took, therefore, was watched with
suspicion; and even those who urged him on in the most perilous
course of all that he had taken were foremost among those who,
when the bolt fell, attacked him for the consequences of his
action.</p>
<p>The storm that had been gathering through all the earlier
months of the year broke in October, when tidings reached the
colony that drafts drawn by Captain Grey on the British Treasury
had been dishonoured. Unfortunately, no official despatches
reached the Governor at the same time, and he was left in a most
difficult and unenviable position&mdash;"naked to his enemies",
as it were, every claimant holding him personally responsible.
For the time his credit was totally destroyed; the banks refused
to negotiate any more of his drafts, and he had to fall back upon
the commissariat chest for &pound;1800 to meet urgent current
expenses of government.</p>
<p>It was not until Christmas Eve that the long-looked-for
despatches arrived, and then there was a plentiful and important
supply. They announced the passing of "An Act for the Better
Government of South Australia", and "An Act for regulating the
Sale of Waste Lands in the Australian Colonies and in New
Zealand", and they also explained the reason why Captain Grey's
bills, amounting to about &pound;14,000, had been
dishonoured.</p>
<p>The whole of the bills drawn for the current service of the
colony would, it was intimated, be accepted, but those drawn in
part payment of outstanding claims the Lords of the Treasury
declined to accept, and directed the Governor to issue debentures
to the holders in exchange for their bills, such debentures to
bear interest at five per cent. from the date at which the bills
became due.</p>
<p>In the despatch to Captain Grey making these intimations. Lord
Stanley said&mdash;</p>
<p>"The justification which you have urged for the course taken
by you is in substance this&mdash;that you understand that all
the bills drawn by your predecessor were to be accepted and paid,
and that the claims, in satisfaction of which you were about to
draw those bills, were similar to those on account of which
Governor Gawler drew his bills. It is true that, in order to
sustain the credit of the colonial Government, the home
Government ultimately consented to provide for the payment of
Governor Gawler's bills, but you appear to have overlooked the
fact that Governor Gawler's conduct in drawing those bills was
strongly disapproved of, and that it formed one of the principal
grounds of his recall. You were warned not to draw any bills
without having previously received authority to do so, and not to
take any measures on your own authority for the settlement of the
debt."</p>
<p>This was strong and somewhat unjust, as Lord Stanley failed to
take into consideration the fact that the bills drawn by Captain
Grey were not for debts contracted by him but by his predecessor,
and were, in fact, mainly for the fulfilment of contracts entered
into before Colonel Gawler received positive instructions not to
incur further liabilities or draw any more bills. There was,
therefore, as Lord Stanley very well knew, no more reason for the
rejection of these claims than those recognized and provided for,
and in a private despatch, dated June 21, 1843, Captain Grey had
the satisfaction, such as it was, of receiving from Lord Stanley
an acknowledgment of this. "It would, indeed, be an ill return,"
he wrote, "for the essential and most effective services which
you have rendered in reducing the expenditure and re-establishing
the finances of South Australia if you should be left to
discharge from your own private fortune a debt originally
contracted, not by yourself, but by your predecessor, for the
public service of that colony."</p>
<p>The consequences of the rejection of the bills were very
serious. In the first place, the colonists concerned had been
kept waiting for eighteen months before they had any settlement
at all; their claims were then arranged by the Governor's bills
on the Lords of the Treasury, to get which cashed they were
obliged to pay the bank five per cent. discount. The bills were
sent to England and refused acceptance; then the lawyers got hold
of them and, in addition to the expense of noting protest, there
was the charge of twenty per cent. for re-exchange, which,
according to the commercial laws of the colony, every endorser of
a bill on England was liable for if that bill was not paid. The
lawyers in the colony were then instructed by the banks to
request an early reimbursement from the unfortunate endorsers,
who were powerless to do more than to hand over the debentures
bearing five per cent. interest, whilst the current rate of bank
interest in the colony was at that time from ten to twelve per
cent. "A child," says Mr. Dutton in his work on South
Australia,** "might guess the consequences to nine out of ten of
the holders of these bills&mdash;the expenses on the returned
bills, being nearly half the amount of the bills themselves, are
finally settled by an advertisement of the sheriff in the public
papers announcing the property of A., B., or C. for peremptory
sale!"</p>
<p class="foot">[** "South Australia and its Mines", by Francis
Dutton. 1846.]</p>
<p>Of course there was a great outcry against Captain Grey, and
he was made the scapegoat to bear all the responsibility and all
the difficulty of the position. How he came through the
embarrassment we shall see later on. Meanwhile attention was
diverted by the publication of the two important Acts passed by
the Imperial Legislature and the despatches accompanying
them.</p>
<p>The "Act for regulating the Sale of Waste Lands in the
Australian Colonies and New Zealand" was passed on the 22nd of
June, and made, as suggested by the Select Committee of the House
of Commons, an important alteration in the mode of applying the
proceeds arising from the sale of lands. By the original Act it
was provided that all lands should be disposed of at the uniform
price of &pound;1 per acre, and the entire proceeds be applied to
emigration. The new Act provided that all waste lands, except
blocks of 20,000 acres, should be put up to public auction at the
minimum price of &pound;1 per acre, and that only one-half of the
proceeds should be applied to the purposes of emigration, the
other half being applicable to local improvements, the
aborigines, and so forth.</p>
<p>Under the new Act the power of sale and conveyance was vested
in the Governor, who was authorized to divide the colony into any
number of territorial districts not exceeding four, in the event
of its being deemed expedient to adopt different sums
respectively as the minimum for the upset price of land in
different parts.</p>
<p>The most important despatch was that conveying a copy of the
Act passed on the 15th of July, entitled "An Act for the Better
Government of South Australia." Its first section repealed
altogether the two former Acts, and with them the authority under
which the Board of South Australian Commissioners and the
Resident Commissioner exercised their functions; the fifth
section empowered her Majesty to establish a form of legislature
similar to that previously in force in all the other Australian
colonies, and instructions were sent to the Governor, under the
royal sign manual, constituting such a Council as being, at least
for the present, best suited to the wants and conditions of the
colony, the hope being held out that at an early period it might
be expedient to grant to the inhabitants of the colony a certain
degree of control over its resources and expenditure by means of
popular representation in the local Legislature.</p>
<p>A few days previous to the passing of this Act&mdash;which
transferred the colony from the Commissioners into the hands of
the Crown&mdash;Lord Stanley laid a statement of the financial
affairs of the colony before the House of Commons, embracing not
only the main items of the debt, in a classified form, but the
manner in which he intended to dispose of the several sums. The
total amount of liabilities was stated to be &pound;405,433. Of
the first item, namely, the Parliamentary grant of &pound;155,000
advanced the previous year, he asked the House to forego the
payment. Colonel Gawler's remaining unpaid bills, amounting to
&pound;27,290, and Captain Grey's bills on account of emigrants'
maintenance, amounting to &pound;17,646, he recommended should be
paid. The &pound;85,000 borrowed by the Commissioners, bearing
interest at from six to ten per cent., to remain outstanding at
three and a half per cent. interest, the bondholders being
guaranteed payment by the British Treasury out of the
Consolidated Fund. The &pound;35,000 outstanding debts of Colonel
Gawler, and the &pound;84,697 borrowed from the Land and
Emigration. Fund, were not at present to be made good, but, as we
have seen. Captain Grey was instructed to issue debentures in the
colony at interest not exceeding five per cent. Lord Stanley
further signified his intention of moving for the sum of
&pound;15,000 to be placed upon the estimates for carrying on the
government, and with that amount he thought the colony would be
in a healthy and prosperous condition.</p>
<p>Despite all drawbacks, by the end of the year (1842) Captain
Grey had succeeded in getting the machinery of his Government in
good working order, and many important measures had been taken in
the interest of the colony. A Board of Audit was appointed, and
all public accounts were submitted to their careful scrutiny; an
Emigration Board had been established for hearing and judging
cases requiring relief; the road across the swamp to the port was
purchased from the South Australian Company for 12,000 acres of
land, in lieu of the &pound;13,000 paid by the Company for its
construction; new roads had been made and streets repaired,
37,814 acres of land had been surveyed for selection, and large
tracts of fresh land had been discovered in the north; the raids
of the natives upon overland traders had been checked by the
appointment of Mr. Eyre as resident magistrate at Morrundee, and
friendly intercourse to some extent established; a system of
tender had been adopted for the supply of everything required for
the public service; provision had been made for the regular
fortnightly transmission of an overland mail between Sydney,
Melbourne and Adelaide, the service to be performed by mounted
police, who would gather up intermediate intelligence along the
line of route, and extend some protection to settlers on the
overland track; and other arrangements and improvements had been
effected. As a set off, there were the dishonoured bills drawn by
Captain Grey; but had he not drawn those bills, the numerous
Government creditors who hung about Adelaide would never have
dispersed into the country. As it was, the country districts
became the chief scenes of activity and progress; 19,641 acres of
land were brought under cultivation during the year, owned by 873
proprietors. When harvest came, rich and bountiful, there was
some difficulty in gathering it in, so large a number of the male
population having left the colony; but the military were
permitted to give their assistance, and the tradesmen of Adelaide
and many gentlemen not otherwise occupied lent a helping hand,
and so it was garnered.</p>
<p>While, however, the country districts were enjoying a small
degree of prosperity, the city was suffering most severely, not
only from the withdrawal of its population, but also from want of
capital. At the end of the year, 642 out of 1915 houses were
vacant, and 216 more were neglected, or had fallen into decay.
During the year no less than 136 writs for the recovery of debts
had passed through the hands of the sheriff, and 37 fiats of
insolvency had been issued. Money in most cases had ceased to
pass as a circulating medium for the purchase of the necessaries
of life, and a system of barter and "truck" was almost universal.
The various trading and commercial interests had become curiously
interwoven with one another to enable the "order" system to be
carried out extensively and with facility. Tradesmen had "orders"
upon merchants, and servants upon tradesmen, and as the holders
had to take the article supplied, however inferior, there was a
perpetual murmuring and dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Depressing as these things were, there could be little doubt
that at the close of 1842 the financial crisis was practically
over, and that the colony had passed through its greatest trial.
But there was no room for boasting; the clouds still hung heavy
in the horizon, and it was evident that neither the troubles of
the Governor nor those of the people were at an end.</p>
<p>It was discouraging to read in the newspapers statements like
the following:&mdash;"Property is now selling by auction in
Adelaide and the neighbourhood, in many cases for less than the
title-deeds cost two years ago. Houses are gladly let to
respectable persons rent free, and notwithstanding this, nearly
half the tenements are empty and falling to pieces. . . ." And
again: "The <i>Countess of Durham</i> will take back a large
number of persons to England, and as many as twenty passages have
been paid for in that vessel. Every ship that leaves for the
other colonies takes from fifteen to twenty passengers, whilst
the arrivals are <i>nil</i>" There were glints of sunshine
through the gloom, and the same newspapers were able to report at
the same time: "The rural districts of the province present a
pleasing contrast to the town. There everything is activity, and
farms are spreading almost like the work of enchantment over the
land, raised up by the industry of our settlers."</p>
<p>On the 4th of January the Governor called his Council
together, and submitted to them the accounts of the last year:
receipts from all sources, &pound;81,813 19<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>.;
expenditure, &pound;84,531 16<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>., of which
&pound;18,069 10<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>. had been spent in the
immigration department, the greater part for the maintenance of
destitute persons, and &pound;26,013 had been paid in liquidation
of outstanding claims; these two items making more than half the
total expenditure, while the entire proceeds of the land had been
included in the total revenue.</p>
<p>Expenditure being still in excess of receipts, the Governor
determined to still further cut down expenses in every
practicable quarter. It is a curious illustration of the state of
the times to find reductions in the salaries of public servants
to the amount of &pound;4000, and that even the master of the
signal station at West Terrace was to be dismissed unless the
public provided the necessary funds by subscription, in which
case "the Government would allow the use of house, staff, and
signals." During the time of the suspension of the signal master,
Messrs. Thomas and Co., the proprietors of the <i>Register</i>,
signalled the arrival of vessels from the flag-staff erected on
their premises in Hindley Street.</p>
<p>Even more significant were the notices that tenders would be
received for leasing to the public the Government wharf at the
port, and that the leases of premises held by the Government for
bonded stores, for the building used by the Supreme Court in
Whitmore Street, and for the house used for the resident
magistrates' court in Currie Street, would each be abandoned! But
the crowning humiliation was perhaps the announcement that, "in
consequence of the reduction in the post-office department, the
services of the letter-carrier to North Adelaide would be
dispensed with!" A "cheese-paring" policy is always hateful to
the majority, and it was so in South Australia.</p>
<p>On the 20th of February, 1843, the "Act for the Better
Government of the Australian Colonies" came into force, but in
the midst of somewhat troublous times. The <i>Examiner</i> opened
a heavy fire upon the Governor, alleging in strong language that
all the disasters of the colony were attributable to him and his
policy. The inflammatory articles worked upon those who had
suffered in the crisis and others, and as one result a "monster
indignation meeting" was called, and, on the 16th of March, in
the Queen's Theatre, a crowded assembly of malcontents moved
"total want of confidence in the administration of his Excellency
Captain Grey," and a petition to her Majesty was drawn up, humbly
praying "that your Majesty will be graciously pleased to take the
case into your most gracious consideration, and either recall his
Excellency the Governor, or issue directions for such an amended
mode of administering the Government of the province as shall to
your Majesty seem meet."</p>
<p>Captain Grey was well aware of the odium that was being cast
upon him in so many quarters, and he had the good sense to take
it calmly. He knew that the majority of the colonists were
interested in the maintenance of a lavish Government expenditure.
During the twelve months preceding his arrival, about
&pound;150,000 had been distributed, in the form of salaries,
allowances, and lucrative contracts, amongst a population of
14,061 people, who only contributed &pound;30,000 towards their
own support; in other words, the British Treasury had paid to
every man, woman, and child in the province upwards of &pound;10
per head per annum, or, if only the males of twenty-one years and
upwards were considered, more than &pound;12 each per annum was
paid by Great Britain for the support of themselves and their
families.</p>
<p>No wonder that, when this liberal annual contribution was
withdrawn, the people should break forth into lamentation at
their indignation meeting!</p>
<p>Even the natives took the cue and were wont to say, "No good,
Gubner Grey, berry good Gubner Gawler&mdash;plenty tuck out."</p>
<p>It was not until the 20th of June that the new Council was
called together. It consisted of eight members, four official
(including the Governor) and four non-official.* In his inaugural
address the Governor announced that, in order to give the public
the greatest facility for becoming acquainted with the minutest
details of the financial arrangements of the Government, and of
increasing their knowledge of its legislative measures, he
sanctioned the admission of strangers to the Council chamber to
hear the debates.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The following were the first members of the
new Legislative Council:&mdash;A.M. Mundy (colonial secretary),
W. Smillie (Advocate-general), C. Sturt (colonial treasurer),
T.S. O'Halloran, T. Williams, J. Morphett, and G.F. Dashwood. Mr.
Williams resigned shortly afterwards, and Mr. Jacob Hagan was
nominated to fill the vacancy.]</p>
<p>This formal meeting was mainly for the purpose of
administering the oaths to the members who had been gazetted, and
of hearing a lengthy address from the Governor. But on the 10th
of October the Legislative Council met for the transaction of
business in the new building in North Terrace erected for their
use, the gallery and also the body of the house being crowded by
strangers, it being the first time that the public had ever been
admitted to the privilege of hearing the deliberations of the
Council, and the first time that non-official members had taken
part in its proceedings.</p>
<p>During the session which came to a close on the 14th of
November, sixteen Bills embracing some important and useful
measures were passed, including "An Ordinance for avoiding
Unnecessary Repetitions in the Ordinances of the Governor and the
Legislative Council"; "An Ordinance to facilitate the Adoption of
the Laws of England in the Administration of Justice"; "An
Ordinance to avoid Trifling and Frivolous Suits at Law"; "An
Ordinance to regulate the Profession of the Law"; "An Ordinance
for the Limitation of Actions and Suits relating to Real
Property, and for simplifying the Remedies for trying the Plights
thereto," and so on.</p>
<p>By the end of the year 1843 it was becoming evident that,
despite all the struggle it had gone through, the colony was in
reality in a healthier and more flourishing condition than it had
been since its foundation. For one thing, it had become a
grain-exporting instead of a grain-importing country, owing to
the fact that thirteen hundred proprietors were now settled upon
their properties in the country districts. Other sources of
wealth and prosperity were opening up on every hand. The year was
remarkable, to an extraordinary degree, for colonial inventions
and improvements in machinery, and for the introduction of new
manufactures. During the time of enforced leisure, while the
general depression lasted, many of the colonists had been turning
their attention to the invention of machinery to facilitate work
when the prosperous days should return. The offer of a premium
for the best reaping-machine resulted in the production of about
fifteen models and designs, and, ultimately, to the general
adoption of Mr. John Ridley's celebrated machine, which gave an
unprecedented impetus to agriculture. Mr. Ridley was a miller at
Hindmarsh, and erected there one of the first steam flour-mills
that had been put up in the colony. He was not a competitor for
the premium, but mechanism was a hobby with him, and although his
knowledge was self-acquired, he was successful in introducing an
implement which revolutionized the agricultural interests of the
colony.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** "The greatest invention ever produced for the
agriculturists of South Australia is Ridley's reaping machine,
which reaps and thrashes the wheat by one simple process. A
machine of this kind could be used only where the climate is dry,
and where the grain is allowed to ripen and harden in the ear. In
some of the Australian colonies the machine cannot be used in
consequence of the moisture in the air. In South Australia,
however, as soon as the crop is fully ripe, the machine is put
into the field and the wheat is reaped and thrashed with amazing
rapidity, and at a very small expenditure. It may safely be said
that the cost of farming has been reduced to the minimum in South
Australia."&mdash;Harcus's "South Australia", p. 61.]</p>
<p>His invention sinks all others into insignificance, but at
about the same period Mr. Pettit invented an extraordinary
plough; Messrs. Swingler and Dent were on the track for finding
out a new motive power; Mr. Pitaway discovered a new method for
propelling boats; Messrs. Harding and Bankhead produced excellent
models of an a&euml;rial machine (the subject being then much
under discussion in England); many colonists followed the example
of their neighbours in New South Wales by boiling down sheep and
cattle for the sake of the tallow; Messrs. Owen and Warner
commenced the manufacture of blacking; Dr. Davey succeeded in
manufacturing starch equal, if not superior, to any imported. It
was an era of progress and enterprise, and all these attempts to
develop the talent and resources of the colony had a beneficial
effect.</p>
<p>But there was another source of wealth which had been
gradually developing, and was destined to be one of the most
potent factors in the continuous prosperity of the colony.</p>
<p>One of the early arrivals at Kangaroo Island in 1836 was
"Professor" Meng&eacute;, an experienced German geologist and
mineralogist, who, finding no scope in the settlement for his
particular studies, commenced the cultivation of a plot of land,
and became so engrossed in it as to be oblivious to everything
else. His little garden was his study, and, notwithstanding the
ravages of the wallaby and other wild animals, he tended it with
an enthusiasm incomprehensible to his fellows.</p>
<p>But in 1837 Mr. Meng&eacute;, with most of the other settlers,
was obliged to remove to the mainland, and he at once turned his
attention to those studies to which he had devoted the greater
part of his life. He made an investigation of the ranges from
Cape Jervis upwards to the Barossa, and was delighted with the
indications he discovered of the existence of gold, silver,
copper, lead, iron, and nearly every variety of precious stones.
In a short time he had collected 100 specimens of rocks and
minerals, which he arranged and classified. But the fact of his
not opening up a single mine led most people to doubt his
assertions that the colony possessed great mineral wealth. This
fact can, however, be easily accounted for; he was a mineralogist
and not a miner, a collector rather than a trader, and it would
have afforded him more pleasure to discover a variety of
specimens than to have come upon one or two rich mines.</p>
<p>He was an eccentric individual, and took his own line in life
without reference to others. He made no important practical
discoveries, but he earned for himself the title of "Father of
Mineralogy" in the colony, as there is no doubt that he was the
first to arouse inquiry into its mineral resources.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* On the first day Mr. Meng&eacute; set foot in
the colony he said that copper and gold abounded&mdash;" the
hills are full of them."<br>
<br>
To him belongs the honour of having proved to a demonstration
that precious stones abound in the colony, and in the course of
his residence there he discovered the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="foot">Specimens of these were sent to the Great
Exhibition of 1851, and attracted considerable attention.]</p>
<p>The first undoubted indication of the existence of silver-lead
ore was made in 1838, on a section belonging to Mr. Osmond
Gilles, at the foot of the hills near Adelaide, but no attempt
was made at that time to open up the mine; while the trade in
land, scarcity of labour, the want of means of transit, diverted
attention from copper, afterwards to become one of the chief
sources of wealth to the colony.</p>
<p>But in 1841 public attention was, for the first time in a
practical manner, directed to mining operations by the formation
of the South Australian Mining Association to work the Wheal
Gawler Silver and Lead Mine, which had just then been discovered
by some practical miners near Glen Osmond. A few tons of the ore
were sent to England in the <i>Cygnet</i> as a sample, and an
assay made in the colony resulted in giving 12,526 ounces of
silver to the ton of ore and 75 per cent. of lead.** Mr. J.B.
Neales was an active worker in the mining association.</p>
<p class="foot">[** It is recorded that the first piece of silver
discovered in this mine was applied to the similar use of
stopping the tooth of a member of the Bar in the colony.]</p>
<p>Much about the same time, a lode of copper was discovered on
the banks of the Onkaparinga, near Noarlunga, in a section
belonging to the South Australian Company, and shortly afterwards
the Wheal Watkins Lead Mine.</p>
<p>But the great discovery of this period&mdash;the valuable
Kapunda Copper Mine&mdash;was made in the latter part of 1842,
first by Mr. C.S. Bagot, youngest son of Captain C.H. Bagot,
whilst gathering some wild flowers, and shortly afterwards by Mr.
F.S. Dutton, who, in his work on the mines of South Australia,
thus describes his part of the discovery. A flock of sheep had
been dispersed in a thunderstorm, and Mr. Dutton while searching
for them rode to the top of a hillock to view the surrounding
country. "After being out nearly the whole day in drenching
rain," says Mr. Dutton, "I ascended this little hill prior to
returning home, for one last view of the surrounding country. The
very spot I pulled the horse up at was beside a large protruding
mass of clay-slate, strongly tinged and impregnated with the
green carbonate of copper. My first impression was that the rock
was covered with a beautiful green moss, but on getting off the
horse I quickly found, by breaking off a piece from it, that the
tinge was as bright in the fracture as on the surface. My
acquaintance with mineralogy was not sufficient to enable me to
pronounce on the precise character of the rock, but I had little
doubt that it was tinged with copper from the close resemblance
of the colour to verdigris."</p>
<p>The steps taken by Mr. Dutton to secure the land containing
the newly discovered mineral led to a curious coincidence. He
says, "To Captain Bagot, with whom I had long been on intimate
terms, I confided my discovery, when he also produced a specimen
which was found by his son, and on a subsequent visit to the
place we found that the two spots were in close proximity,
although at first, from the one being on a hill and the other in
a plain, we thought they were two different places. To make a
long story short, we soon ascertained that the specimens were
undoubtedly copper ores; the discovery was of course kept secret;
we got eighty acres surveyed; all the forms as laid down by the
old land-sales regulations were complied with; the section was
advertised for a whole month in the Government <i>Gazette</i>,
and we became the purchasers of it at the fixed Government price
for waste lands of &pound;1 per acre."</p>
<p>Having secured the services of a few Cornish miners, a
considerable quantity of rich ore was raised,* and it soon became
evident that the mine was of unusual value.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Previous to the erection of smelting works and
the construction of a railway to Kapunda, the ore was carted to
the Port on drays holding two tons each, and drawn in dry weather
by six bullocks and in wet by eight. They reached Gawler Town
(eighteen miles) on the first night, the Dry Creek (eighteen
miles more) on the next night, and arrived at the Port early on
the following morning. The convoys consisted of eight or ten
teams, and made the journey with ease once every ten days,
besides carrying up to the mines on their return all supplies
required there.]</p>
<p>In purchasing the eighty acres Mr. Dutton thought he had taken
in all the copper deposit, but some other out-croppings were
observed, not only by his own miners, but by other people. When
the next section of one hundred acres was put up to auction in
April, 1845, it was bought by Captain Bagot for the large sum of
&pound;2210, so keen was the competition.</p>
<p>While excitement was still running high on the subject of the
Kapunda mines, the Montacute Mine, in the Mount Lofty Range, ten
miles from Adelaide and sixteen from the Port, was discovered by
one Andrew Henderson, overseer of Mr. Fortnum, when searching for
a bullock which had strayed. Mr. Fortnum was a chemist and
mineralogist, and he at once pronounced the specimen shown him by
his overseer to be copper ore of a rich quality. Instead of
keeping his own counsel, the secret was divulged, first to one,
then to another, until it reached the survey office, and the
chance of securing the land without the competition of a public
sale was lost. It was brought to the hammer on the 16th of
February, 1844, when the new regulations had come into operation.
Mr. Baker was deputed by a small syndicate to bid as high as
&pound;4000 for the eighty-acre section, but at that time little
was known about the value of the Kapunda ores, and the bidding
was not very high, and when the price reached &pound;1550 it was
knocked down to Mr. Baker for that sum. Within a few hours, the
syndicate resold thirty hundred parts for &pound;5000, and the
property became merged into the Montacute Mining Company.</p>
<p>Several other mines were discovered and partially worked about
this time, such as the Yattagolinga, the Onkaparinga, and others;
but all these were practically abandoned when, in 1845, the great
discovery of the Burra-Burra Mine was made, which threw all the
other mines into insignificance, and gave an enormous impetus to
the mining interests of the colony.</p>
<br>
<p>Notwithstanding the abuse poured upon Sir George Grey, he
pursued the even tenor of his course, and many felt no little
surprise that he never alluded to the stinging articles which
were constantly issuing from the local press. The explanation is
to be found in a letter addressed to an old friend in England,
Mr. George Fife Angas.</p>
<p>"With regard to the articles in the &mdash;&mdash;, to which
you allude," he says, "I have never read them, and am sometimes
quite surprised, when I receive papers from England, to find what
abuse has been heaped upon me here. If I had not pursued this
course I could hardly have avoided being annoyed."</p>
<p>How chagrined those editors would have felt if they had only
known this, and what a flood of light it throws upon the quiet,
self-contained man, upon whom so much responsibility
rested.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** "He ever maintained," says his biographer,
"that it was the duty of a servant of the Crown to go on in the
performance of the public service without devoting time and
energy to the refutation of attacks made upon him. He held that
such attacks would always be made when public duties were
faithfully performed, and that they would meet with adequate and
proper judgment when time had afforded the evidence upon which
public opinion could be fully expressed. And he considered that
the energies of those to whom had been committed great
responsibilities, were too valuable to be wasted in useless
apologies or lengthened arguments, and should be applied
exclusively to useful and beneficial purposes."]</p>
<p>The year 1844 opened with great activity in business and
industrial concerns generally. The depression was now so far over
as to enable all classes of the community to breathe more freely;
Governor Grey was no longer regarded by the majority as the enemy
of the colony, and the opposite conviction was strengthened by
one of his first acts at the beginning of the year, namely, a
reduction of the heavy port charges&mdash;a concession which
crave general satisfaction.</p>
<p>With the comparative leisure consequent upon a partial
cessation of hostilities, he was able to give attention to many
matters which had hitherto been impossible. His well-known
advocacy of the rights of the aborigines found expression in his
opening address to the Legislative Council, when he announced his
intention to bring in a Bill for the reception of the evidence of
aborigines without oath. In urging the necessity of endeavouring
to remedy their disabilities he said&mdash;</p>
<p>"One of the most distinguishing features of modern
colonization is the anxiety manifested by the immigrants to
render their occupation of 'the ancient territory of the
aborigines productive of the blessings of Christianity and
civilization to the people whose country they enter, and the
settlers in this colony have ever lent the Government a zealous
aid in the promotion of any plans having for their object the
civilization and welfare of the native population. It is
obviously one of the most important duties of the Legislature of
a country circumstanced as this is, to promote this feeling by
every means in their power, and to endeavour to induce each
member of the community to perform, within the sphere of his
individual influence, those duties towards, the aborigines for
the fulfilment of which he rendered himself morally responsible
when he entered the territory. No prouder or brighter distinction
could adorn the history of South Australia than the fact of its
first European occupants bequeathing to their children a
territory unsullied by deeds of violence and crime, and I rely
upon your bestowing the most careful consideration upon the
measures I am about to introduce into the Council with the object
of giving increased means of ameliorating the condition of the
aborigines, both to the Government and to the settlers, upon
whose Christian and benevolent sentiments towards them the
welfare of the scattered and wandering native population must
mainly depend."</p>
<p>In addition to the bill for the reception of evidence without
oath, another was brought in for the care of the orphans of
aborigines. In recommending it. Governor Grey said he considered
that the care of such orphans afforded the best chance of
civilizing the race, by educating the children and attaching them
to our customs. It was a plan that had been tried at Swan River
with satisfactory results.</p>
<p>It was a sign of the improvement of the times that attention
was once more seriously directed towards exploration. In April
the Governor was able to accomplish a long-cherished wish of
visiting the south-eastern districts and that part of the
overland route to Port Phillip lying within the boundary of the
colony. Accompanied by Mr. Charles Bonney, commissioner of Crown
lands, Mr. Burr, deputy surveyor-general, Mr. George French
Angas, and Mr. Gisborne, the Governor set forth on his travels.
The results of the journey were very satisfactory, as it was
ascertained that by keeping near the sea-coast, instead of
pursuing the line of route previously traversed, there was an
almost uninterrupted tract of good country between the rivers
Murray and Glenelg, widening as it approached the boundaries of
New South Wales, until it formed one of the most extensive and
continuous tracts of good country at that time known to exist
within the limits of South Australia. Moreover, the south-eastern
portion of the province was as fertile as any other part of it,
capable of easy communication in all directions by drays, and
with good bays on the coast for the shipment of produce.</p>
<p>Another expedition, under the command of Captain Sturt, was
fitted out this year with the object of obtaining some knowledge
of the interior of the continent. Captain Sturt was one of the
idols of the people, the discoverer of their province, the father
of South Australian exploration, a fellow-settler, and withal a
man whose courage, energy, and scientific attainments won the
admiration of all. He started on the 10th of August, when
business was suspended in the city to do honour to the leader and
his adventurous band. Among the objects of the expedition was the
discovery of a supposed chain of mountains lying parallel with
the Darling and running north-west, with rivers rising from them.
Great preparations had been made for the expedition, and when the
cavalcade set forth down King William Street towards the Torrens,
escorted by over a hundred horsemen, who accompanied the party as
far as Dry Creek, it seemed that all the city and the regions
round about had assembled to do honour to the occasion. At German
Pass, where now the township of Angaston stands, the travellers
were hospitably entertained by Mr. J.H. Angas.</p>
<p>Despatches were received from time to time, detailing how
Captain Sturt had found that "the flats of the Darling exceeded
in luxuriant verdure those of the Murray"; how, on the way to the
hills, the wind blew with the constancy and intensity of a hot
blast from a furnace, insomuch that they had great difficulty in
breathing so rarefied an atmosphere; how scurvy broke out, and
illness set in; and how, in one part of the journey, the
thermometer, fixed in the shade of a large tree four feet from
the ground, stationary at 135&deg; Fahr., at 2.30 p.m. rose in
the direct rays of the sun to 157&deg;. The travellers proceeded
as far northward as water was known to exist, and then had to
carry forward a supply. On the 13th of February Captain Sturt
reported: "I was then nearly abreast of Moreton Bay in point of
latitude, more than two hundred miles to the westward of the
Darling, and in longitude 141&deg; 22' as near as I could judge;
and yet, as I looked around, and from the top of a small
sand-hill I had ascended, I could see no change in the terrible
desert into which I had penetrated. The horizon was unbroken by a
single mound from north round to north again, and it was as level
as the ocean. . . ."</p>
<p>"I returned from this excursion," he continues later, "with
the full conviction on my mind that I had twice been within
fifty, perhaps thirty, miles of an inland sea. It was, in truth,
impossible that such a country, from which the very birds of the
air shrank away, should continue much further; but whether such
really was the case remains yet to be ascertained."</p>
<p>He determined to make another attempt to reach the north or
north-western interior as soon as the rains would enable him to
do so; but on account of the shortness of provisions he deemed it
expedient to send back a third of his men in charge of Mr. Poole,
his chief assistant, who had suffered much from scurvy. The party
left the dep&ocirc;t on the 13th of June, 1845; and on the
following day Mr. Poole suddenly expired, from internal
hemorrhage, and his place was supplied by Mr. Piesse, the
storekeeper.</p>
<p>After their departure, Captain Sturt again and again made
excursions, in the hope of finding a practicable route to the
north, but was each time driven back from some uncontrollable
cause. On the last occasion he rode eight hundred and forty-three
miles in five weeks, and for twelve weeks was exposed to the
perils of excessive heat, insufficient food, and loathsome water,
which resulted in a severe attack of scurvy and a painful
affection of the eyes. At the end of January, 1846, he arrived in
Adelaide. The results of the expedition may be summed up as
follows:&mdash;Knowledge was gained of an immense stony desert in
the interior, which it was found impossible to penetrate or even
to skirt sufficiently to ascertain its extent in any direction
attempted at that time; a large creek was discovered (named by
Captain Sturt "Cooper's Creek", in honour of Sir Charles Cooper,
the Chief Justice), and which was afterwards found to be a
continuation of the Victoria of Mitchell. It was satisfactory
also for South Australians to know that most of the good country
seen while out on this expedition was within the boundary of
their own country.</p>
<p>In the same month of the same year that Captain Sturt started
to explore the interior (namely, August, 1844), another
expedition, the result of private enterprise, under the
leadership of Mr. Darke, set forth from Port Lincoln and
proceeded in the direction of Fowler's Bay, from whence a report
had come, brought by runaway sailors, that good country was to be
found. The explorers penetrated for about three hundred miles
into the interior and found excellent country, but on the return
journey their leader, Mr. Darke, was killed by the natives.</p>
<p>Not only was returning prosperity shown in the matter of
exploration, but in various other departments there were signs of
progress, probably in none more than in ecclesiastical affairs.
Large accessions were made to the ministerial staff of the
various religious bodies. The Church of Scotland had erected a
new place of worship in Grenfell Street, and the
Congregationalists an auxiliary one in Franklin Street. The
members of the Church of Rome had welcomed their bishop, and
commenced the erection of a place of worship on West Terrace. The
Methodist New Connexion had re-opened the chapel in Hindley
Street, and opened another in the village of Walkerville; the
Primitive Methodists had received two new ministers; and other
denominations either commenced operations or extended those
already begun.</p>
<p>A picture of early days and scenes in a country Nonconformist
chapel is graphically drawn up by an early settler
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It was in the very wet winter of 1849 that we first attended
the little church at McLaren Vale. No place of worship in all
Christendom could have been more bare or unadorned than that. A
barn-like building, the thatch the only ceiling, broad square
windows letting in the sunshine to waken sleepers, and a very
shaky deal structure called a pulpit.</p>
<p>"There were two square pews with doors, which were thought
much of by the two families who sat in them; two benches with
arms and backs occupied by families next in honour, while
ordinary folk sat on slabs of wood propped up on bricks. At one
time a sofa-bedstead, and at another a chest of drawers with a
saddle on the top, were kept in the church.</p>
<p>"But if the place was primitive, the people were also. The
drone of the singing, the waving of the peppermint-gum branches
to keep away the flies, the minister's little boy on the
pulpit-step catching flies by the dozen by that slow movement of
the hand peculiar to the young colonial, the old-fashioned
toilets, and the dogs! Very cheerful chat used to go on outside
the door before and after service, and sometimes dinner was taken
there, so as to be ready for school in the afternoon. The
children were marvels of unknowing freshness. A teacher showing a
picture to a little boy in the Sunday school, of a man cutting
down a tree, the child examined it with the keenest interest, and
then said, 'I reckon he'll have it down by next Sunday.'" *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Quoted in "Jubilee Record of
Congregationalism", by Rev. F.W. Cox.]</p>
<p>The affairs of the Church of England had not, prior to this
year (1845), been in so flourishing a condition as might have
been expected. The Rev. C.B. Howard had laboured alone till 1840,
when the Rev. James Farrell arrived to share in the work, which
had largely increased. In addition to the Church of the Holy
Trinity, there was by that time St. John's, in the eastern part
of the city, and shortly afterwards places of worship were
erected at the Port and on the Sturt, and these two clergymen
performed the services at the two city churches regularly, and at
the other two occasionally.</p>
<p>In 1840 the South Australian Church Building Society was
formed for the purpose of aiding in the erection of churches and
Sunday schools. Mr. Howard worked very arduously and earnestly in
this cause, and his death in July, 1843, at the early age of
thirty-six, was attributed in large measure to anxiety with
regard to the responsibility he had undertaken as a trustee in
this matter. On the 23rd of July he was buried. The Government
offices were closed; the Governor and most of the officials, the
soldiery, police, ministers of all denominations, citizens, and
Sunday-school children, formed part of the imposing funeral
<i>cort&eacute;ge</i>, and it is scarcely an exaggeration to say
that his loss was mourned by every man, woman, and child in the
place. After the death of Mr. Howard, the Rev. J. Farrell was the
only clergyman in the colony, and remained so for two or three
years. By his energy in raising funds, Trinity Church, which had
become heavily encumbered by debt, was saved from being disposed
of as a granary or store, or from falling into the hands of the
Roman Catholics&mdash;both dangers being imminent.</p>
<p>The year 1845 was one of marked tranquillity, although not
without alarms of various kinds. On two occasions the colonists
were greatly agitated on the question of convictism. Early in the
year, it was announced that the home Government intended to send
out a shipment of the Parkhurst prison boys. This was regarded as
a gross infraction of the principles upon which the colony was
founded, and at once a large meeting was called, which pledged
itself to resist by all lawful means the introduction of such
characters into the province. A memorial to Lord Stanley was
drawn up, and in the end the memorialists carried the day.</p>
<p>Later in the year (September), there was another scare, and
this time the threatened danger was the proposed introduction of
conditionally pardoned men from Van Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>The following notice had been published in the Tasmanian
newspapers:&mdash;"Notice is hereby given to all holders of
conditional pardons who may be desirous of having such pardons
extended to the limits of the Australian colonies and New
Zealand, that upon making their application for the said
extension of indulgence to this office, they will be laid before
the Lieutenant-General in order that those approved of by his
Excellency may be immediately granted."</p>
<p>The ordeal of trial by public meeting was again resorted to,
and a vigorous protest was made with good effect; the
conditionally pardoned men never came to the colony.</p>
<p>Another source of anxiety was the extraordinary prevalence of
bush-fires. They generally occurred on the Mount Lofty ranges,
and in the height of summer presented a scene of great grandeur.
They had a singular effect on the atmosphere, sometimes
reproducing an Etna or a Vesuvius, at others extending for a
considerable distance along the sides or tops of the hills,
causing a lurid glare, and sending up dense volumes of smoke. In
proportion as population increased, great damage was done to
property, and active steps were taken to prevent these tires; but
their origin was always involved in doubt, many ascribing them to
ignition by friction of the long dry grass, to the firing of the
country by the natives in order the more readily to obtain wild
animals, to the carelessness of travellers who did not properly
stamp out their camp-fires, or to smokers scattering the live
ashes of their pipes on the dry grass or other inflammable
substances.</p>
<p>The greatest event of the year had to do, not with fears and
alarms, but with a discovery which was to prove a source of
incalculable wealth and prosperity to the colony.</p>
<p>Towards the middle of June, it was reported that in the far
north a shepherd had accidentally stumbled on a lump of copper
ore, of almost incredible richness and purity, cropping out of
the surface, and that he had brought specimens into Adelaide. It
was further stated that the deposit of copper was traceable for
fifteen miles, and was visible for a breadth of from fifteen to
twenty feet. There was so much secrecy kept as to the locality
that many pretended to regard the affair as a hoax; those in the
secret assured themselves, however, of the correctness of the
shepherd's report, and an application was forthwith made to the
Governor for a special survey of twenty thousand acres in one
block, in accordance with the Crown lands regulations. Captain
Grey was willing enough to further the object, but a monetary
difficulty arose. How was the requisite &pound;20,000 to be
raised? The colony was only beginning to recover from its
financial embarrassments, and hard cash was a very scarce
commodity, the banks collectively having at that time only about
&pound;25,000 in coin and bullion, and neither bank-notes,
promissory notes, nor anything short of gold, silver, or copper
coin was accepted at the Treasury in payment for land. There was
no time to be lost, for if the news of the discovery reached
England, or even one or more of the other colonies, the prize
might pass out of the hands of South Australians altogether.</p>
<p>As the first applicants were unable to raise the necessary
funds, one or two other parties combined and made the attempt,
but were also unsuccessful. The first applicants, as might be
supposed, entered their protest against the second party, and as
neither could succeed, war waged between them. Those two
organised parties were known familiarly as the "Nobs" and the
"Snobs", the former being leading capitalists, and the latter,
for the most part, tradesmen. Mr. William Giles, the manager of
the South Australian Company, might be considered as a third
party, he having offered to advance &pound;10,000, leaving the
Nobs, or capitalists, to make up the remainder. But even this was
not forthcoming, and the tradesmen tried to coalesce with Mr.
Giles. As, however, their offer was not accepted, they determined
to prevent the other side from entering the field by withdrawing
from the bank the amount of their united funds in specie!</p>
<p>At this stage the Governor, seeing there was so wide a
division in the camp, postponed for a few days the time for
receiving tenders for the coveted block of land, and this gave
the rival parties an opportunity to mature their plans&mdash;no
easy matter, while excitement remained at white heat and suspense
almost unbearable. Previous to the Governor's determination
becoming known, Mr. Giles and his party had offered &pound;12,000
in sovereigns and the cheque of the bank for the remaining
&pound;8000. Another party followed with a somewhat similar
offer, having raised the sum of &pound;10,000 by the sale of
property and the payment of exorbitant premiums for money, the
bank having refused to discount their bills, or make them any
advance for the projected speculation.</p>
<p>Ultimately Mr. Giles withdrew from the contest, leaving the
two rival parties in possession of the field, and as neither
could separately obtain the prize, they agreed to become joint
purchasers and participators in the coveted treasure. Their
application for the twenty thousand acres at Burra Creek was
lodged with the Governor on the 18th of August, only two days
prior to the limit of time allowed by the Government for
completing the purchase, and the &pound;20,000 in specie was duly
paid into the Treasury.</p>
<p>Although the two parties agreed to unite for the purchase of
the land, they did not intend to work the mine in concert, and
arrangements were therefore made for a division of the property
into northern and southern blocks, the possession to be decided
by lot. The northern and richest half fell to the "Snobs", or
tradesmen's party, who were henceforth known as the South
Australian Mining Association, and their mine as the Burra, while
the southern half was called the Princess Royal Mine.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** "The effect of the combination to purchase
the Burra-Burra mines was," says the biographer of Sir George
Grey, "that the ownership was thus distributed amongst a very
large number of deserving people, who, with their families,
enjoyed considerable benefits from these rich mines for many
years. This effort to spread as widely as possible the advantages
arising from the ownership of lands or mines, or, indeed, any of
the forces of Nature, was typical of Captain Grey's lifelong
desire."]</p>
<p>The Burra Mine is situated about a hundred miles from
Adelaide, the road being for the most part over level or gently
undulating ground. The hills in the mineral district range
generally north and south, and vary from 2000 to 2500 feet above
the sea-level.</p>
<p>In the course of two or three years the &pound;5 shares became
worth &pound;220, a fact in the history of mining at that time
probably unparalleled. For the first six years the produce of the
mines amounted to nearly 80,000 tons of copper ore, and the
profit obtained on the working for that period was no less than
&pound;438,552, or nearly half a million. These results were
arrived at under several disadvantages, but chiefly from the
absence of machinery, the amount of unskilled labour, and the
distance the ore had to be conveyed over unmade roads.</p>
<p>When at the end of June, 1845, and shortly after the discovery
of the Burra Mine, Captain Grey called the Legislative Council
together for the despatch of public business, his opening address
was of a highly gratifying character. He was able to announce
that the finances of the colony were in a very satisfactory
state; the Government was able to make prompt payment of all
obligations it had contracted, and rapid progress was being made
in the general wealth and prosperity. One of the most important
measures brought forward in the Legislative Council in this year
by the Governor, was a Bill for the repeal of the pilotage,
tonnage, wharfage, and all other port and harbour dues and
charges, thus opening Port Adelaide and all other ports within
the province to ships of all nations, free of expense in
entering, remaining, and departing. To make up for any monetary
deficiency certain judicious customs duties were imposed. It was
a measure that not only created great surprise, but gave
unqualified satisfaction, and a public meeting was held to accord
the thanks of all classes of the community to the Governor, and
to pledge themselves to give him their support. As a matter of
fact he stood in the proud position of being the first in the
Australian colonies to follow the enlightened policy originally
adopted by Sir Stamford Raffles at Singapore. Besides the
increase of trade and traffic that would ensue, it would also
ensure a sufficient supply of shipping to convey the export
produce of the colony to the British or other markets. During the
previous export season there had been some 6000 tons of colonial
produce for shipment, and there was only the prospect of
sufficient shipping to convey 3000 tons, while the want of
hundreds of tons of shipping was actually experienced.</p>
<p>It was a curious fact that whereas during the period of the
financial crisis the colonists could not say anything severe
enough with regard to the administration of the Governor, in
1844-45, when it was found that he had successfully tided them
over their difficulties, they were equally at a loss to find
adequate words of praise.</p>
<p>At the close of the session, the members of the Council
thanked him for his kind bearing to them individually and
collectively, and expressed their conviction that "the urbanity
of his manners to them, and the courteous attention he had given
to their opinions and suggestions, had conduced to that perfect
freedom of discussion which was necessary to the efficiency of
the Council as a legislative body, and so essential to its
obtaining the confidence of the whole community."</p>
<p>Alas! that the recognition of merit came so late in this case
as in so many others. Only two months later, and the rumour ran
through the colony that Captain Grey had been appointed to the
Governorship of New Zealand, on the ground of his peculiar
qualifications for dealing with the natives, who were in a
disturbed state, and that Major Robe was to succeed him.</p>
<p>A forensic mania had set in. The English newspapers brought an
account of the addresses in the Imperial Parliament on the
appointment; how Lord John Russell, in an excellent speech, had
said that, in giving Captain Grey the government of South
Australia, he had given him as difficult a problem in colonial
administration as could be committed to any man, "And I must
say," added Lord John, "that, after four or five years'
experience of his administration there, he has solved that
problem with a degree of energy and success which I could hardly
have expected from any one. He has extricated the colony and
gained the good will both of settlers and aborigines."</p>
<p>Not less flattering was the testimony borne by Sir Robert Peel
to the character and efficient services of Captain Grey.</p>
<p>When, therefore, on the 20th of October, he announced to the
Legislative Council that so soon as the <i>Elphinstone</i> would
be ready to proceed to sea he would, in pursuance of her
Majesty's commands, hand over the administration of the
Government to the officer who had been sent out to relieve him,
the voice of the whole people was heard in lamentation for their
loss and praise for the leader they had so little appreciated,
and all the intervening days of his sojourn in Adelaide were
spent in receiving and replying to addresses.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the 26th of October, the <em>Elphinstone</em>
weighed anchor and proceeded on her voyage with Captain Grey on
board, bound for the scene of his new, but at that time not very
promising field of labour, and bearing with him the respect, good
will, and good wishes of almost every settler in South
Australia.</p>
<p>He had lived down incessant, flagrant, and altogether
unmerited abuse and opposition, conscious that he was in the
right and that his motives were pure; he had proceeded from first
to last in a straight line of policy, with judgment, decision,
and firmness, and his reward was in the fact that he had saved
the colony from a chaotic state, and placed it on a sound and
solid basis, and had proved himself one of the foremost political
and financial reformers of his day.</p>
<p>From the day when Captain Grey received the first inkling of
his appointment to the Governorship of South Australia, to the
day when he quitted it to take office in New Zealand, he was
greatly indebted to the wisdom, experience, and sagacity of Mr.
George Fife Angas, who probably knew more of the actual condition
of the colony than any other man then living. A series of
valuable letters, many of which are preserved in the public
library at Auckland, New Zealand,* were written by him, and were
extremely helpful to the Governor throughout his
administration.</p>
<p class="foot">[* This voluminous correspondence, and certified
copies of the letters in the Auckland library, are in the present
possession of the writer, but instead of quoting it, an extract
from the "Life of Sir George Grey" is given in preference.]</p>
<p>"The friendship of these two men," says the biographer of Sir
George Grey, "commenced when the young explorer was in England,
in 1840. Anxious to learn the views of a man so interested and
experienced in questions of colonization, on the Government
project of founding a colony on the north coast of Australia,
Grey sought and obtained an interview with Mr. Angas. The latter
strenuously opposed the plan, foreseeing many difficulties and
disasters. Years afterwards, he raised his voice in the
Legislative Council of South Australia against the proposed
settlement being made, except as a purely tropical colony, with
aid from Calcutta and London.</p>
<p>"Mr. G.F. Angas was one of the most sincere and untiring
friends a young colony ever had. A director of the Company under
whose auspices South Australia was founded, he lost no
opportunity of doing it a service, sparing neither time, money,
nor personal effort in its cause. At the same time, he strongly
disapproved of the extravagance which characterized the new
community. No words can be more decided than those he used on
this subject in writing to Captain Grey, in 1843:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'You know my views as to the absolute necessity of settlers
in a new colony adopting the most rigid economy in all their
establishments and expenditure. A neglect of this has been the
curse of South Australia, and the ruin of its best interests, and
nothing has made it greater enemies at home and abroad.'</p>
<p>"These letters are remarkably interesting. They contain an
account of the formation of the South Australian Society, and its
first prospectus. They form a record of what was done by this one
man during the term of Captain Grey's Governorship and residence
at Adelaide. He was indeed helped and cheered by the co-operation
and sympathy of the Governor, who furnished him with statistics
and other information concerning the colony; but, in the details
of his work, he was practically single-handed.</p>
<p>"He wrote pamphlets, publishing and circulating them at his
own expense; he obtained interviews with Cabinet Ministers and
other leaders of public opinion; he delivered lectures in every
town through which he passed in travelling about Great Britain;
he appointed agents, who were, he wrote, 'men of influence and
devoted to South Australia', to perform the same duties; he kept
up an active correspondence for over three years with the owners
of six or seven hundred American ships engaged in the South Sea
whale-fisheries, with the object of inducing them to put into
South Australia for their supplies.</p>
<p>"He was in constant communication with European States, with
commercial houses in China, Mauritius, and Bombay, and with the
various missionary societies; approaching the latter with a plan
for establishing colleges in Adelaide, at which young men might
receive a suitable training for future work amongst the heathen
of the Pacific islands.</p>
<p>"In every direction from which prosperity might flow to the
colony, Mr. Angas thus laboriously made a channel for its
passage, turning up the sods of ignorance and apathy. He met with
discouragements which would have caused one who had the real
interests of the young community and of humanity less at heart,
to give up the weary struggle in despair. But, foiled at one
point, Mr. Angas only turned with fresh energy to another.</p>
<p>"Thus he wrote: 'When I found our Government resolved upon
doing nothing for us, I commenced an active correspondence with
the Continent, and I do confidently expect that we shall get out
one hundred Germans this spring to Adelaide. Often enough, my
spirit sinks under my incessant labour, on the one hand from the
shameful, cruel, and ungrateful treatment I have met with from
many persons in the colony, who have thereby amply repaid me for
having been their best and most generous friend, and on the other
hand from the utter apathy which universally exists in this
country towards the colony. Still, I will never abandon the work
as long as God enables me to continue it. I began it with the
best of intentions, and I shall not leave it in this
extremity.'</p>
<p>"In February, 1844, he wrote that if his resources had not
been crippled by the dishonesty of agents in South Australia, he
would have been able to send out from one to two thousand Germans
as settlers. 'But,' he added, 'beaten down as I am with all my
troubles, I will not rest until you have emigration renewed from
this country.'</p>
<p>"Mr. Angas was successful in his introduction of German
colonists, and, at his own expense, settled large tracts of
agricultural country. Many of these communities still retain
their Teutonic character. This experiment worked so well that
years afterwards Sir George Grey, when Governor of Cape Colony,
carried it out on a larger scale, under somewhat different
conditions, and with still more marked success. . . .</p>
<p>"It is a mournful criticism upon the justice of human judgment
to find that after the lapse of a quarter of a century, when Mr.
Angas was upwards of eighty years of age, his claims to the
gratitude of South Australia and the South Australians were
treated with contempt, his long years of faithful service
depreciated, and his lavish expenditure of money and zeal turned
into derision.</p>
<p>"In 1869 Sir George Grey himself, smarting under unmerited
coldness and neglect, received from his old fellow-worker in
South Australia a pathetic letter claiming his sympathy, and
asking Sir George Grey to bear testimony to the unselfishness of
his efforts for the well-being of the colony, for which, in years
long gone by, they had worked so zealously together. The answer
given must have done much to soothe the wounded feelings of Mr.
Angas, and to vindicate his undoubted services to the colony.</p>
<p>"The instability of human affairs was thus strikingly
exemplified. Mr. Angas had served the people with a loyal and
unswerving faith, and the people had forsaken him. Sir George
Grey had served the Government of Great Britain with unexampled
vigour and success, and, as a reward, was dismissed
contemptuously. Yet history will record the deeds and
achievements of both when the names of their detractors are
forgotten."**</p>

<p>Of the subsequent brilliant career of Sir George Grey we
cannot concern ourselves in detail here. After settling the New
Zealand difficulty, and bringing the war to a successful
termination, he was made a baronet and a D.C.L. of the Oxford
University. He was appointed Governor of Cape Colony, and some
years later, by special request of the Colonial Office, again
became Governor of New Zealand, when the long Maori War at
Taranaki was raging. Eventually he took up his residence in New
Zealand as a private citizen, accepted an office and a seat in
the colonial Legislature, an instance probably without a parallel
of a statesman entering the political arena in the very colony
where he had himself been twice the Governor.</p>

<p>O<small>N</small> the 14th of October, 1845, all conjectures
as to the successor of Captain Grey were set at rest by the
arrival in the colony of Major Frederick Holt Robe, of the 87th
Royal Irish Fusiliers, who had been appointed by her Majesty to
the Governorship of South Australia. He had at one time held the
office of military secretary at Mauritius, under Major-General
Sir William Nicolay, and at the date of his appointment to South
Australia he was holding a similar office at Gibraltar. In order
to obtain the services of Captain Grey in New Zealand as quickly
as possible&mdash;for affairs were in a disturbed and critical
state there&mdash;Major Robe was instructed to proceed direct
from Gibraltar, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Alexandria and the Isthmus of
Suez, to Bombay, where the <em>Elphinstone</em> was in readiness
to convey him to South Australia, the vessel then to proceed
forthwith to New Zealand with Captain Grey.</p>
<p>Major Robe was in almost every respect a startling contrast to
his predecessor. He was a blunt, honest soldier, well versed in
his profession, but his manners were not prepossessing, nor had
he those gifts and graces which tend to make men popular. He knew
nothing of the art of public speaking, and this in itself created
a prejudice against him in many quarters; he was unfortunately a
bachelor, and this, from a social point of view, was a great
drawback, as a lady should always accompany a Governor, and take
her place as leader of society; he was a Tory of the Tories, and
proclaimed from the housetop his "aversion to popular
tendencies"; he was an undisguised advocate of High Church
principles, and took no pains whatever to conceal his abhorrence
of Nonconformity.</p>
<p>There are many things in heaven and on earth and in the
Colonial Office which are not dreamed of in the philosophy of
ordinary mortals, and how Major Robe could have been selected to
fill the office of Governor in "the Paradise of Dissent" will
probably ever remain a mystery. It is only just to add in this
place that he was an honourable, upright man, greatly respected
in the limited sphere of his personal friendships, and true as
steel to his Sovereign and to the political party whose views he
was determined, if it lay in his power, should predominate
throughout the colony.</p>
<p>For prudential reasons Major Robe was gazetted
<i>Lieutenant</i>-Governor, the object being to protect Captain
Grey from any proceedings that might be taken against him by the
holders of certain dishonoured bills drawn upon the British
Government, and for which the parties refused to take debentures.
So long, therefore, as Captain Grey retained official connection
with the colony as "Governor", he was entitled to the protection
which pertained to that office.</p>
<p>Shortly after Major Robe assumed the government of the
province a notice appeared in the <i>Gazette</i> informing all
who had claims upon the Government that debentures would be made
and issued with the interest due thereon to the 31st of March,
1846, that they could be obtained on application, and that no
further interest would be allowed after that date. This
intimation was satisfactory enough for those whose claims were
admitted, but its obligatory character did not prevent those
whose accounts were disputed from subsequently obtaining the
whole or a portion of the amount due to them.</p>
<p>One of his first acts was to rescind certain resolutions,
issued shortly before by his predecessor, for regulating the
disposal of waste lands, on the ground that in most cases the
regulations had operated disadvantageously to the colonial
interests. He claimed the right to submit any lands that had
passed the hammer, but had acquired a higher value than the upset
price first put upon them, a second time to public auction,
instead of allowing them to be selected by private contract. This
measure, as a matter of course, met with considerable
disapprobation, the <i>Observer</i> dubbing the new Governor as
"principal Land-jobber and Auctioneer-in-chief (by appointment)
to her Majesty."</p>
<p>This was a bad beginning, but it was no fault of the
Governor&mdash;it was simply his misfortune. He was a military
man of the old school, and had been accustomed to rule and to be
obeyed; he was totally unable to realize the genius of a rising
colony or to sympathize with the liberal views and sturdy
independence of the men over whom he was officially placed, and
thus it was that from first to last he was continually "in hot
water", and aroused the controversial spirit among the colonists
to its highest degree.</p>
<p>In November news was received that Lord Stanley had made an
attempt to introduce a new Waste Lands Bill into the Imperial
Parliament, containing clauses imposing a royalty or reservation
on the minerals raised, in violation of an Act previously passed
and which had been in operation some years. The Bill was stated
to have been defeated by Lords Lansdowne and Monteagle, who thus
laid the colony under a deep obligation. But the matter did not
rest here. Lord Stanley prepared an altered measure, submitted it
to members during the recess, and in the mean time obtained the
opinion of the law officers of the Crown, who considered that the
existing Act would bear the construction that a royalty on, or
reservation of, minerals might be admitted; whereupon he sent a
despatch to the Lieutenant-Governor advising the imposition,
forwarding at the same time the text of the legal opinion.</p>
<p>The colonists were up in arms, and at once a public meeting
was called to express regret that such a Bill as the one Lord
Stanley had brought forward should ever have been devised; that
it was an uncalled-for interference with the proper duties of the
Legislative Council as it related to the internal government of
the province; that it was a breach of public faith under which
most of the colonists had emigrated to South Australia, and that,
if any such alteration as that proposed of the perfect tenure
under which the waste lands had hitherto been purchased were
carried into effect, it would discourage all further introduction
and investment of capital, and in other respects be fatal to the
interests and prosperity of the colony. It was resolved that
appeal should be made to her Majesty for protection, and that,
until the Queen's action should be made known, the Governor
should be strongly entreated to suspend or defer the operation of
the measure.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* It may be noted in passing that at this
meeting Mr. John Baker, destined to take a leading part hereafter
in the Legislature, made his maiden speech in public.]</p>
<p>A little glimpse into the mental attitudes of Governor and
people may be obtained from the speeches made when the petition
to her Majesty, signed by seven hundred colonists, was presented,
with a memorial to the Governor, by a deputation consisting of a
number of members of the Legislature, justices of the peace, and
leading colonists. Major O'Halloran was the spokesman on behalf
of the deputation, and in concluding his speech he said&mdash;"We
yield to none in attachment to our Sovereign and her Crown, but
we are not prepared to bow the knee to the present or any other
minister who may be disposed to trample on our rights or tamper
with our interests."</p>
<p>Then uprose the Governor, cold and stern, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Your memorial stigmatizes as oppressive certain proposed
measures of the Queen's Government having reference to her
Majesty's waste lands in this part of her dominions, and you
entreat me, in the event of those measures having actually passed
the Houses of Parliament, to interpose such authority as may be
confided to me in order to frustrate for a period the intentions
of the Queen and of the Parliament. It is barely consistent with
common sense to imagine that such large discretion would in any
case be confided to a local governor of so distant a possession
of the Crown, and you make this request at a time when it is a
matter of public notoriety that the measures of which you
complain have not met the sanction of the Imperial Parliament.
Under these circumstances you will not be surprised at my
declining to give any other reply to your memorial than an
assurance that I will at all times feel pleasure in being made
the medium of transmitting, for presentation to the Queen, the
dutiful and loyal petitions and addresses which her Majesty's
subjects in this province may desire to have laid at the foot of
the throne."</p>
<p>A traveller once said of Niagara, "No picture can give you any
true idea of it; you may paint the Falls, but you cannot paint
the <i>roar</i> of the waters!" In like manner, type may give the
words of Major Robe, but it is impossible to reproduce the
austere tone and the irritating style in which his simplest
utterances were given. As a matter of fact, in the instance under
notice the colonists were premature; the measure did not receive
the sanction of the Imperial Parliament, and the Bill of Lord
Stanley was thrown out. So ended the first skirmish on the
royalty question. The great battle was to be fought at a future
period.</p>
<p>In December, Mr. W. Giles, on behalf of the South Australian
Company, brought an action against the Lieutenant-Governor for
refusing to allow him (Mr. Giles) to exercise certain preliminary
land orders in the selection of some mineral sections near the
Montacute Mine. The judge refused to allow the action to proceed,
alleging that the Company had not used due diligence after
Captain Grey's proclamation to the holders of land orders in
which the time was fixed for making the selection.</p>
<p>At that time Mr. Gladstone was Secretary of State for the
Colonies, and as soon as he became aware that an action had been
brought against the Governor, he forwarded a despatch to him
expressing strong disapprobation of the course pursued. Adverting
to the refusal of the Court to grant the injunction, he
said&mdash;</p>
<p>"It is fortunate that such was the decision of the Court. An
opposite judgment might have raised many embarrassing
difficulties. But," he added, "I cannot sanction the course which
you followed in this case. By appearing, or permitting any
officer of the Crown to appear, in defence of such a suit, you
virtually acknowledged that the head of the local Government was
amenable to the jurisdiction of the courts of the colony which he
governs. It does not follow that because the question of
jurisdiction was not discussed on this occasion, it was therefore
not decided or compromised. On the contrary, the absence of any
such discussion, resulting as it did from the absence on your
part of any such objection, was a clear though tacit
acknowledgment that the asserted jurisdiction really existed. I
object to that acknowledgment, not on any ground of mere dignity,
or usage, or precedent, but because thus to break down the
barriers which separate the judicial and administrative
authorities must result in great practical evils. The immunities
of the Sovereign in this country, and the corresponding
immunities of a Governor in the colony he rules, exist for the
good of the people at large. If it were admitted that you, as
Governor of South Australia, were amenable to the courts of the
colony, you would of course be liable to fine, to distress, and
imprisonment at their bidding."</p>
<p>The despatch concluded&mdash;</p>
<p>"I must therefore desire that the precedent which has been
established in this case be avoided in all future cases, and that
no act be done (except with the express previous sanction of her
Majesty's Government) from which it could be inferred that you
are amenable to the jurisdiction of any court in South Australia
so long as you retain her Majesty's commission for the
administration of the government of that colony."</p>
<p>It is somewhat singular that Major Robe, who had assumed the
title of Lieutenant-Governor expressly for the protection of his
predecessor, should have overlooked the position which the
Governor of the colony is generally supposed to occupy, and of
which his own case furnished such a striking illustration.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the year intelligence arrived that the
Imperial Parliament had taken some action upon certain memorials
sent home from the Australian colonies generally, praying for the
removal of import duty on their corn. In the debate Lord Howick
pointed out the injustice of admitting corn from Canada free of
duty, characterizing the concession as a bribe to secure the good
will of that colony towards Britain, but admitting that the boon
was a conditional one requiring the Canadians to levy a duty on
American corn, so that the United States should not send their
produce to Britain through Canada. He urged that there need be no
apprehension of foreign grain reaching Britain through the
Australian colonies, as Chili, the nearest country from which
these colonies could obtain a supply, was too far off to admit of
any such traffic being carried on profitably.</p>
<p>In the course of a very able speech Lord Howick
said&mdash;</p>
<p>"I maintain that by refusing this concession to Australia you
are teaching Canada that it has nothing to be grateful for. You
teach it that what you have done has not been from a sense of
justice, or for the common advantage of the Empire, but that it
was a bribe for acquiescing in the continuance of your
Government. It is like the money given by the Roman Empire in its
decline to the barbarians who were threatening at the
gates&mdash;it is sure to purchase only further demands. On the
other hand, if you now act to Australia, from which you have
nothing to fear, as you have acted towards Canada, you are
showing to your colonies generally that you are acting on the
principle of a large and liberal policy and a desire to promote
their welfare as integral portions of the British Empire."</p>
<p>It was certainly a hard case that Canada, near to the United
States, dissatisfied and rebellious, should have the duty on her
corn reduced, while Australia, patient and loyal, with no
dangerous neighbour, had no relief or indulgence. Lord Howick had
shot his arrows at the right mark. If the colonies were integral
parts of the Empire, and not mere excrescences, what need was
there for any commercial restrictions? And the Australians felt
and complained that whilst they had soil and climate for the
ample growth of corn, they were checked by Britain denying them a
market, and they reasonably urged that if such a market were
allowed it would enable the settlers to consume British
manufactured goods&mdash;their chief article of import&mdash;to a
greatly enlarged extent.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** "The singularity of the necessity for such an
Act is only equalled by the novelty of the measure itself, which
is probably without precedent, in delegating to an officer,
irresponsible to the people, the power of taxation, without limit
as to the amount or time, on the export of any article enumerated
in the Act. And one can hardly realize in the present day that a
country that was reduced to such an extremity should, after a
lapse of a few years, become for the number of its people the
greatest exporters of wheat and flour in the world."&mdash;Sir
Henry Ayers.]</p>
<p>It must always be borne in mind that South Australia was well
represented in England by able men deeply interested in
everything that concerned her welfare, and in many cases
financially pledged to her prosperity, so that questions
discussed in the colony were more or less re-echoed in the mother
country, and vice versa. The South Australian Association, too,
was still in existence, and its members were active both in and
out of Parliament on her behalf, and through the persevering
labours of these combined forces the obnoxious tax on corn, as
well as many other well-founded grievances, was in process of
time removed.</p>
<p>The year 1846 opened prosperously with a balance in hand of
&pound;50,000 applicable to the purposes of immigration, local
improvements, and the satisfaction of outstanding claims. One
matter that gave rise to mingled hope and apprehension was the
ever-increasing yield of mineral wealth. In itself this was
encouraging, but many colonial interests seemed likely to suffer
from the investment of much capital in unproductive mines, and
from the withdrawal of labour of various kinds to the new
pursuit.</p>
<p>The question of royalties on minerals was revived on the 5th
of March by the publication in the Government <i>Gazette</i> of a
minute from the Governor informing the public of the rules that
had been established for the future disposal of the waste lands
of the Crown in South Australia, by which it was intended to
secure a royalty of one-fifteenth upon all minerals raised from
lands alienated from the Crown. Major Robe stated that the
correspondence handed to him by his predecessor showed that the
mineral wealth of the colony had attracted the attention of
capitalists in England to a considerable extent, and a company in
London had proposed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies to
treat with the Government for a monopoly of all mines in South
Australia belonging to the Crown, upon the basis of a lease, with
rights of mining upon payment of a seignorage or royalty upon the
produce of those mines. Lord Stanley rejected this proposal, but
the question of reservation of royalties with a view to the
ulterior benefit of the colony was submitted for the
consideration of her Majesty's Commissioners of Woods and
Forests, and to the Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners,
as well as to one of the first geologists in England, and
subsequently to her Majesty's law advisers. No objection was
raised by any of these to the proposed imposition, and as
regarded the colonists themselves, Major Robe said in a minute to
the home authorities:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I do not anticipate that there will be much difference of
opinion amongst the colonists upon the question of the expediency
of reserving a moderate royalty on metallic minerals when it is
declared, under authority, that the proceeds thereof, after
deducting the cost of collection, will be applied to the same
purposes as the gross proceeds of the sale of the waste lands of
the Crown under the Act 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 36. Instead of large
present receipts, founded, perhaps, on gambling speculation as to
the chances or probabilities of future results (which receipts
will cease as soon as all the mineral land has been selected),
there will be provided in aid of a constant stream of emigration
from the United Kingdom, a growing income proportioned to the
advancing wealth of the colony. Such is the view taken by the
Commissioners and by her Majesty's advisers, and in that view I
entirely concur."</p>
<p>But the colonists did not, nor did they agree with the "few
short rules based upon the principle of a royalty of
one-fifteenth of the produce" which the Governor had drawn
up.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The published regulations stipulated for a
right of free access to all mines by duly appointed servants of
the Crown; a right to select, for free occupancy, a portion of
land not exceeding a quarter of an acre, near the mouth of any
mine, fur a residence or store "for the person or persons
appointed to receive the Queen's dish or dues"; the right of
commuting from time to time, for periods not exceeding twelve
months, the Queen's fifteenth in kind for payments in money; the
right of recovering such money by distress; the reference of all
questions to the Governor in Executive Council, for decision; the
sale of land, as heretofore, with the exception of the
reservation stated; the reservation on lands open for selection
without competition; the leasing of mineral lands for periods not
exceeding twenty-one years, such leases to be subject to
competition at public auction; the forfeiture of the leases for
non-payment, underletting without license, etc.; the
appropriation of the proceeds from sale or lease of lands and
royalties; the fees payable for deeds, leases, and
registration.]</p>
<p>Nor did they agree with the law officers of the Crown, who
gave it as their opinion that there was nothing incompatible with
the provisions of the Act in the plan proposed. "The waste lands
of the Crown," they said, "if alienated and conveyed, must be
conveyed in the manner prescribed by the Act, but there is
nothing in its provisions restrictive of the right which the
Crown possesses to reserve to itself any portion of its property
or interests, or which makes it compulsory to part with
them."</p>
<p>The publication of the Governor's minute, together with the
regulations for carrying it out and the opinion of the law
officers of the Crown thereon, was the signal for a great
demonstration against the measure. On a vacant acre at the corner
of King William Street and North Terrace a platform, or hustings,
was erected, which was crowded with members of Council, justices
of the peace, and some of the most influential colonists, who,
surrounded by a large and excited audience, characterized the
action of the Government as "illegal, unjust, and impolitic, and,
if persevered in, highly injurious to the best interests of the
colony, as it would check the industry and exertions of the
settlers, and discourage emigrants from Great Britain."</p>
<p>They argued that it was illegal, inasmuch as it set at naught
the guarantees of the Act of Parliament, and unjust, as it was in
direct contravention of the original tenure upon which the waste
lands were alienated from the Crown and thereby gave to the
colony one of its peculiar features.</p>
<p>One of the resolutions moved at the meeting by Mr. E.
Stephens, J.P., and seconded by Mr. J. Baker, J.P., set forth
that "the repeated attempts of the Colonial Office to set at
naught in this colony the stipulations and solemn engagements
guaranteed to the colonists by Acts of the Imperial Parliament
are subversive of that confidence and respect which the settlers
ever have entertained, and are desirous of continuing to
entertain towards the parent State."</p>
<p>A short and typical specimen of South Australian oratory in
those early days may not be out of place here. In moving this
resolution Mr. E. Stephens said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Her Majesty never had under that flag"&mdash;pointing to the
royal ensign waving from the flagstaff at Government
House&mdash;"a more devoted and loyal people than she has in
South Australia. Under every infliction and every injury their
loyalty has been unquestioned. But there were points at which
they felt they could endure no longer, and no reckless and
ruthless hand should destroy their rights or involve their
privileges with impunity, and if such attempts were sanctioned by
their rulers, nay, if they were not discountenanced by them,
their loyalty and their devotedness were indeed endangered. It
was true they had left the home of their fathers, but they were
Britons still. They had left their native soil, but not for a
foreign land; they had come hither to perpetuate her
institutions, to introduce her laws, to share her privileges, to
be governed by her wisdom, to link their destinies to hers; but
they came also to enjoy her freedom. They came forth alone and
unaided by the parent State to a land whose existence was almost
unknown, to extend the boundaries of her empire, and by their
energies, their industry, and their capital to add another
flourishing province to her dominions. And did England out of her
treasury assist them? Did she give to their departure pomp and
circumstance? No. They crossed the wide waste of waters in
humility, but with fixity of purpose, to make for themselves a
home, and to found an empire in the wilderness. Not one shilling
did England contribute. Nay, more, let it never be forgotten that
before she suffered them to quit her shores she compelled them to
leave behind twenty thousand pledges in the shape of so many
pounds sterling, that they should be no burden to the parent
State. These recent attempts by the Home Government to depart
from the terms of the Act constituting the colony could be
likened to so many nibbles at the seal of the bond entered into
by the mother country and the colonists, and this royalty
imposition was the last and most flagrant and most unjustifiable
attempt to rob the colony of one of its guaranteed and peculiar
features."</p>
<p>The ringing cheers that greeted this speech proved not only
the spirit of sturdy independence in the colonists, but also the
futility of sending as their Governor such a man as Major Robe.
Petitions to both Houses of the Imperial Parliament were very
numerously signed, and so this stage of the opposition
closed.</p>
<p>The next step was taken in the Legislative Council on the 30th
of September, when the New Waste Lands Bill was introduced by the
advocate-general. The second reading was opposed by Mr. J.
Morphett, who moved as an amendment that the Bill be read that
day six months. This was seconded by Major O'Halloran, and
supported by Messrs. Bagot and Davenport; but, upon a division,
the amendment was lost, and the original motion carried.</p>
<p>Thereupon a scene ensued&mdash;one of the historic scenes of
the colonial Legislature. Mr. J. Morphett rose from his seat,
and, followed at once by Major O'Halloran and Messrs. Bagot and
Davenport, left the council chamber, and by so doing left the
august and astonished body without a quorum. The audience in the
strangers' gallery shouted "Bravo!" while the Governor and his
executive stood dumfounded. When silence was restored Major Robe
declared the Council adjourned.</p>
<p>A week later the Council reassembled, and the Governor
expressed in mild terms his disapproval of the unconstitutional
mode of opposing the Government pursued by the non-official
members; but the recalcitrant members justified their conduct,
and retorted that it was the only course left open to them, as
"his Excellency invariably neutralized the votes of independent
members in every case when the votes were equal, and on every
measure resisted by the non-officials."</p>
<p>On the motion for going into committee on the Bill, the
recusant members proposed, seconded, and supported an amendment
that it was inexpedient to do so until the fate of the measure
proposed to be introduced into the English House of Commons
became known. When the Council divided, the Governor again
exercised his casting vote, and in announcing the result of the
division said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Having vindicated the dignity of the Crown and asserted its
right to insist on the presence of members, he had no hesitation
in saying that he should, in deference to the strongly expressed
opinion of all the non-official members, and in compliance with
the earnest appeal of their senior (Major O'Halloran), authorize
the withdrawal of the Bill."</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the unpopularity of the Governor, he took no
steps whatever to mend his ways. On the contrary, he recklessly
plunged into a fresh sea of controversy on a subject concerning
which men are more tenacious of their opinions than on any
other.</p>
<p>While the royalties question was still the topic of the day,
the members and adherents of the Church of England called a
public meeting to memorialize the Governor to make a grant in aid
of religion from the public funds. Of course this stirred the
Dissenters to action, and they attended the meeting in such force
that when the first resolution was proposed by the Church party,
affirming that such a grant was desirable, an amendment was moved
by the Dissenters, and was carried by an overwhelming majority.
The meeting being then in their hands, they passed resolutions
condemning State aid to religion, and adopted a memorial to the
Governor, urging him not to give effect to the views of the
Church party. A deputation of leading men was appointed to
present the memorial to the Governor, and in due course they
waited upon him. The document having been read, they waited
anxiously for his reply. It came in these terms: "I have no
remarks to make, gentlemen"; and, bowing, he dismissed the
deputation. Whether the discourtesy were intentional or not, it
was, to say the least, irritating.</p>
<p>While feeling was still running high on this subject, and in
the same session in which the royalties question had been so
warmly discussed. Major Robe threw down the gauntlet for a
pitched battle with the religious sects, by introducing the
question of State aid to religion into the Council. He did so in
these words: "The provisions heretofore made from the revenues of
the province for purposes of religion and religious instruction
are quite inadequate. Judging from returns lately laid before
Parliament, it would appear that South Australia is one of the
most backward of all the-colonies of the British Empire in
providing from its public resources for the means of worshipping
that Being to whom we owe our existence and all the blessings we
enjoy. This should not be; it is not in accordance with the
spirit of the colonists themselves. Let it no longer be a
reproach upon the Government and the legislative body of the
province having control over the public finances. The members of
the Church of England, forming more than half of the entire
population, have lately received the benefit of two additional
clergymen sent among them, but for these we are mainly indebted
to the pious zeal of our friends in England. The due apportioning
of Government aid among the different sects of professing
Christians is a question of some difficulty, but it is not, I
trust, unsurmountable."</p>
<p>In this speech Major Robe, more explicitly, perhaps, than in
his other oracular utterances, showed his total incapacity to
grasp an idea of the principles on which the colony was founded.
A Tory of the Tories, relying on the vote of the officials in the
Legislative Chamber and his own casting vote, and unduly
prejudiced in favour of his own opinions, he had set his mind on
carrying a measure which the most bigoted would have been ready
to acknowledge was diametrically opposed to the ideas of the
fathers and founders of the colony, to the Act of Parliament
establishing it, and to the wishes of the large majority of the
colonists.</p>
<p>The history of this principle of disassociation of Church and
State is one of the most interesting in colonial annals. Let us
now follow the present phase of it.</p>
<p>On the second day of the session Mr. J. Morphett, destined
hereafter to take a high place in the councils of the province,
presented a petition, couched almost in the identical words of
the Governor, praying for Government aid to religion and
education. It added that the petitioners could not close their
minds to the fact that the voluntary principle had hitherto
proved utterly inadequate to supply the needs of the colony, and
that they considered the true interests of every Government were
best consulted by promoting the moral and religious well-being of
the community.</p>
<p>There were hundreds of men who, on the strength of the
voluntary principle being the law of the land, had emigrated to
South Australia, and this was the signal for them to be up and
doing. They held a meeting at the "Company's" offices in North
Terrace to discuss measures for the defence and maintenance of
religious freedom, and set forth in an elaborate memorial a long
array of all the stock arguments against the proposal of the
Governor&mdash;arguments too well known to need specifying in
detail&mdash;and concluded with the prayer "that every
denomination should stand on its own basis, without State
interference, favour, or support, and that no legislative
enactment might be passed, or grant made, for support of religion
in South Australia."</p>
<p>Despite motions in the Legislative Council by Mr. (afterwards
Sir Samuel) Davenport and Captain Bagot, urging delay, and a
petition from the advocates of voluntaryism, got up and signed in
twenty-four hours by two hundred persons, including many
ministers of religion, also urging delay, on the 16th of July Mr.
J. Morphett moved in the Council "that his Excellency be
requested to introduce with the estimates for the financial year
1847, a sum of money for religious and educational purposes, to
be apportioned among the different denominations of Christians in
the province in the rate of their numbers according to the late
census returns, and to be applied by their respective bodies
either in building places of public worship, the support of
ministers of religion, the erection of school-houses, or the
maintenance of schoolmasters or schoolmistresses; the sums, as
apportioned, to be paid to, and appropriated by, a limited number
of individuals in the nature of trustees to be nominated by the
respective bodies; the trustees to furnish a report to his
Excellency the Governor of the appropriation, accompanied by a
proper statement of accounts to be laid before the Council."</p>
<p>The speciousness of this motion will be seen as we proceed.
Amendments were moved against it, but were lost, and, the vote
having been taken, the matter was allowed to rest for a time so
far as the action of the Government was concerned.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, meetings were held, and the discussion of
"political religion" became the order of the day. Deputations
were sent to the Governor conveying memorials, the burden of
which was in many cases that the vote of the Legislative Council
in aid of religion without regard to its truth or error was a
violation of the rights of conscience, by compelling individuals
to contribute to the support of modes of worship or forms of
doctrine which they believed to be unscriptural and erroneous;
that it was a misappropriation of the public funds, a direct
breach of the public pledges given at the foundation of the
colony, and not justified by the then present circumstances of
the province; and that it was, consequently, a measure
inexpedient and unjust.</p>
<p>In the suddenness of its introduction, and the haste in which
the vote had been passed, the advocates of voluntaryism had been
taken at a disadvantage. True, there had been, during the
administration of Captain Grey, a skirmish on the subject, but it
was conceived that the ghost of a "State-aided Church" had been
laid. Now it was determined that, whether on the present issue
they lost or won, such steps should be taken that, when another
opportunity arose, they would be in a position to tight the
question to its bitter end. Accordingly, a society was formed,
called "The South Australian League for the Maintenance of
Religious Freedom in the Province", its object being not only to
oppose the present grant so far as it was still possible, but to
adopt such measures as should prevent the perpetuity of any such
action in the colony.</p>
<p>In a young colony, where the settlers are bent on making
provision for their wives and families, and of seeing them in
comfortable circumstances before the bread-winners shall be
overtaken by illness or old age; where the restraints of the
mother country are to a great extent thrown off, and every one
feels himself to be his own master; when the old religious ties
have to some degree been broken and the enthusiasm of Christian
work has received a check by the breaking up of old associations,
it is a good thing to see large bodies of men, at great
self-sacrifice, take up with enthusiasm a question of this kind.
If the moral history of South Australia were to be written this
episode which we now chronicle would probably be represented as
the sowing time of the great harvest of moral and spiritual good
which was developed in later years.</p>
<p>One of the first steps undertaken by the League was to publish
an address setting forth the position they proposed to occupy.
"In all political matters we know that obedience is due to the
Government. We may doubt the expediency or even the justice of
their measures, but we are still bound to obey them, except in
those rare cases which we may hope will never arise in this
colony. But in religion we owe no obedience to the State. This is
a matter beyond the control of Government and in which they
cannot rightfully interfere. If the State should overstep its
legislative boundaries in this matter, resistance is always the
right, and may often be the duty, of every individual. It is a
point upon which there can be no concession and no compromise,
and at all times and under all circumstances we are bound to
protest against, and, so far as may be done by lawful and
peaceful means, to impede the execution of laws which violate
these our highest and most essential rights. We are ready to
'render unto C&aelig;sar the things that are Caesar's', but we
render to God, and to God only, the things that are God's."</p>
<p>It was maintained, and maintained truly, that this principle
was recognized in the Act of Parliament, and by the Commissioners
originally appointed to carry it into execution; that in all
printed statements this was set forth as an inducement to
emigration, and that they were justified in requiring a
fulfilment of the pledge which induced so many of them to
emigrate.</p>
<p>The machinery of the League was soon in working order,
information was disseminated, memorials to Queen and Parliament
prepared, and it was soon apparent that the members were actuated
by a purpose, and would shortly become the most able and active
organization ever formed in the colony.</p>
<p>Meanwhile numerous petitions were presented in the Council
Chamber for and against religious endowments, until, on the 19th
of August, the question of a grant was formally introduced, when
Mr. Morphett moved that the sum of &pound;1110 10<i>s</i>. be
placed upon the Supplementary Estimates for 1846, to be
appropriated in accordance with the terms of his previous motion,
with the addition that the trustees should be appointed in such
manner as the Governor might by proclamation direct, subject to
the proviso that such trustees should, on the 31st of March,
1847, make a report to the Governor, to be laid before the
Legislative Council, of the manner in which the moneys had been
applied.</p>
<p>An amendment was moved, but it was found that the mover and
seconder were the only opponents to the grant.</p>
<p>It must be admitted that the sum was not a large one, although
on a question of principle, of course, this was immaterial. The
proportion for the Jews, who had petitioned to be included, was
found to be &pound;2 18<i>s</i>. per annum!</p>
<p>Less than a month later the conduct of the Lieutenant-Governor
and of the Legislative Council in voting this money in opposition
to the declared sentiments of the great majority of the colonists
was the subject of an appeal to her Majesty and to the Imperial
Parliament for protection, the memorial to the Queen being signed
by 2530 persons.</p>
<p>Eventually good came out of the apparent evil. The carrying of
such a question in opposition to the wishes of the large majority
raised at once the desire for a more popular system of
representation, and zealous efforts were forthwith inaugurated to
this end.</p>
<p>Before the year closed the Governor, who had been the cause of
all the strife, had grown weary of his office, for which it must
have been obvious to himself, as it was to everybody else, that
he was unfit, and had appealed to the Home Government to relieve
him of his responsibilities.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the year 1846 was a year of
controversy and political discontent, in other respects it was
marked by progress and prosperity. On the 14th of January, 1846,
the announcement was made of Captain Sturt's return from the
interior, after an unsuccessful attempt to proceed beyond
latitude 24&deg; 30' and longitude 138&deg; to the north-west and
latitude 25&deg; 45', longitude 139&deg; 13' northwards. Both he
and his party had suffered greatly from scurvy.</p>
<p>The arrival of the party at Adelaide was an event of deep
interest, especially to those who had witnessed its outfit and
start some eighteen months previously. The procession was as
novel as it was interesting&mdash;the long beards of the brave
fellows almost hid their faces, and, on account of the exposure
to which they had been subjected, they appeared more like a race
of beings from the regions into which they had penetrated than
Europeans. The wheels of the drays were caulked and stopped up
with whatever materials could be spared to fill up gaps and
cracks to keep them together; the woodwork of the drays showed
that every particle of oil and turpentine had been extracted by
the heat of the sun. But the most singular object of attraction
was the remainder of the flock of sheep following, from habit,
the last of the drays, as quietly and regularly as a rear guard
of infantry. As the expedition moved slowly up Rundle Street and
King William Street, the spectacle appeared too impressive and
suggestive to excite shouts or greetings, but many and hearty
were the welcomes given when the party halted in Victoria
Square.</p>
<p>In the early part of the year (1846) the Governor, accompanied
by his private secretary and Mr. Burr, deputy surveyor-general,
proceeded in the Government cutter, which on this occasion was
commanded by Captain Lipson, R.N., harbour-master, for the
purpose of examining the bays on the south-east coast of the
colony, of which little was then known. The Governor reported
favourably of Lacepede Bay and of Guichen Bay, at which a
township had been laid out and was about to be offered for sale.
During his six weeks' trip, in which he traversed about four
hundred miles by land and as much by sea, he gained and imparted
so much valuable scientific information, that towards the end of
the year he was induced to take another trip, this time to
Spencer's Gulf, to inspect the ports and inlets along the coast.
On his return he officially reported the results of his visit,
and in the course of his geological observations remarked that on
the western side of the head of Spencer's Gulf the hills were of
red sandstone, in strata nearly horizontal. "In other parts of
the globe," he said, "coal is very frequently associated with
this formation." At Lipson's Cove he observed that the rocks seen
were gneiss and hornblende schist, nearly vertical and having a
general course north and south. "This formation," he wrote, "is,
in other countries, frequently rich in metallic ores." If Major
Robe could only have made known how rich and extensive, the
mineral deposits on Yorke's Peninsula were, he would have made
his name immortal. But the great discovery was not made until
fifteen years later.</p>
<p>The only other attempt at exploration this year was undertaken
in July by Mr. J.A. Horrocks, who, with a small party and a
camel, set forth to explore the then unknown country north-west
of the ranges of Mount Arden. Progress was reported from time to
time, but in September came the sad tidings that by the
accidental discharge of a gun Mr. Horrocks had been shot;
mortification set in, and he died. The expedition, therefore,
returned to Adelaide.</p>
<p>Wealth and prosperity, by the end of 1846, had now fairly
taken the place of previous depression. Agricultural operations
had been extensively increased, large land sales effected, vast
mineral treasures developed, and trade and shipping considerably
augmented. The result of this commercial revival was the
recommencement of immigration.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** Four vessels arrived from England in one day,
and 655 persons landed in one week.]</p>
<p>The new year (1847) opened auspiciously. Intelligence was
received that Lord John Russell had succeeded Lord Stanley as
Secretary of State for the Colonies, and that one of the first
acts of the new Secretary had been to expunge the royalty clause
from the imperial Waste Lands' Bill. In this direction,
therefore, the horizon appeared clearer, but in another the
clouds of religious dissensions were still gathering
blackness.</p>
<p>In April the Governor submitted to the Legislative Council the
reports of the trustees, showing how the grants in aid of
religion and education had been distributed. A discussion ensued,
in the course of which the Governor said he considered the plan
adopted in New South Wales for the distribution of money in aid
of religion and education was preferable to the one being carried
out in South Australia, the principle of the former being to
assist voluntary efforts in the proportion of half or equal the
amount so raised; and a few days later he laid before the Council
"A Bill to promote the Building of Churches and Places of Worship
and to provide for the Maintenance of Ministers of Religion." It
proposed that whenever a sum of not less than &pound;150 had been
raised by private contribution towards a church or chapel, a
grant in aid should be allowed of any sum not exceeding the
amount of the private contribution, provided that no grant should
exceed the sum of &pound;300. As regarded ministers' stipends,
when one hundred persons residing within a reasonable distance of
a proposed place of worship subscribed to a declaration setting
forth their desire to attend the same, the sum of &pound;100 per
annum would be granted towards the minister's stipend; when two
hundred persons subscribed, the sum of &pound;150 would be
granted; and when five hundred subscribed, &pound;200, which was
to be the maximum rate in aid of stipends. Various other scales
for a lesser number than one hundred subscribers were introduced
into the Bill, together with elaborate clauses relating to the
duties and obligations of trustees.</p>
<p>This Bill (which was designated by the <i>Observer</i> "a
legislative curiosity") set the members of the League for the
Maintenance of Religious Freedom to work in earnest, as it
preserved all the objectionable features of the one it was
intended to supersede and would infallibly perpetuate and augment
the dissatisfaction, strife, and alienation caused by the former
measure, more especially as this was framed on a model to suit
the exigencies of a penal settlement.</p>
<p>On the second reading of the Bill the advocate-general
undertook the defence of the measure, and a warm discussion
followed. When the Council was in committee on the Bill many
amusing views were propounded and some curious theological
arguments adduced. Thus, one member (Mr. Hagen) was of opinion
that the word "Christian" should precede "worship", and read
"places of Christian worship". Major O'Halloran objected, on the
ground that all those who contributed should benefit, whether
Chinese, Hindoos, or New Zealanders, and by the proposed title
the Jews would be excluded; to which the Governor replied, "He
only understood the Council was legislating for the Christian
religion&mdash;the Bill for the promotion of Mahommedanism was
not yet before them!"</p>
<p>Meantime the League was busy in pulpit, press, and platform,
all over the province, while Mr. George Fife Angas, to whom the
petition for aid in the mother country had been sent, was using
every endeavour to bring the matter under the notice of members
of Parliament and others in Great Britain interested in the
question. But, notwithstanding all this, the Bill was read a
third time and was carried.</p>
<p>During the session of the Council an elaborate financial
statement was made, showing that the land sales had enabled the
Governor to appropriate the sum of &pound;160,000 to immigration
purposes, and that arrangements had been made for the despatch
from England of one vessel per month. A large sum was also
available for public works and buildings. In the matter of
education a Bill was introduced fixing the payment of teachers as
follows:&mdash;Minimum rate for twenty scholars, &pound;26, and
maximum rate for fifty scholars and upwards, &pound;50; for every
advanced pupil, teachers should receive &pound;1 per head
additional. A Board of Education was constituted to carry out the
provisions of the Bill.</p>
<p>On the 5th of October the Governor laid important despatches
on the table from the Secretary of State, relative to (1) the
Corporation of the city of Adelaide, advising the Council to
bring in a Bill to establish it, if the colonists thought fit;
(2) the threatened combination of the Land League, which Earl
Grey regretted, as if the price of land were kept down by this
means the flow of immigration would be checked; and (3) an
acknowledgment of the petition to the Queen against State support
to religion. It ran thus: "You will acquaint the petitioners that
I have not been able to advise the Queen to assent to the
request; on the contrary, it has been my duty humbly to submit to
her Majesty my opinion that the course pursued by the local
Legislature in applying some part of the local revenue towards
the promotion of religion, knowledge, and education in the colony
merits her Majesty's entire approbation, and it is not in any
respect at variance with the terms of the Act of Parliament under
which the colony was originally founded. The Queen has been
graciously pleased to adopt and sanction that opinion."</p>
<p>A further despatch informed Major Robe that the Government had
acceded to his request by removing him from the civil to the
military service, and that Sir H.E.F. Young had been appointed as
his successor in the government of the province. It soon
transpired that Major Robe had been appointed to the rank of
lieutenant-colonel in the army, and that his future work would be
that of deputy quartermaster-general at Mauritius.</p>
<p>On the 5th of October the Council was adjourned <i>sine
die</i>, but was called together again on the 9th of November to
consider an important despatch on the subject of steam
communication with the mother country, proposals for the
conveyance of mails having been received by the Secretary of
State from the Peninsular and Oriental Company and the Indian and
Australian Company.</p>
<p>The estimated amount of postage charged upon letters and
newspapers conveyed between the United Kingdom and the Australian
colonies for the year ending October, 1847, was &pound;14,799
14<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. Preference was given to the Cape route as
best for South Australia, and &pound;3000 was agreed upon as the
share of that colony towards the subsidy.</p>
<p>It was thought that this would be the last session in which
Major Robe would take part, but unforeseen circumstances arose to
delay his departure, and when, on the 2nd of June, 1848, the
Legislative Council was opened, he was ready with the annual
estimates&mdash;a duty that he had little anticipated would
devolve upon him again. During that long interval there had been
a comparative cessation from strife; no startling episodes had
occurred, the stream of prosperity had been gliding along
smoothly, and the foundation and development of new enterprises
had not been neglected.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* See "Chronological Summary of Events" at end
of work].</p>
<p>Only one set of circumstances demands any detailed notice
here, as it bears upon the "great controversy" of that day and of
a greater one looming in the distance.</p>
<p>In religious circles in the mother country there was a great
revival of zeal on behalf of the missionary and colonial work of
the Church, and the Baroness (then Miss) Burdett-Coutts had
offered an endowment of &pound;800 a year each for the foundation
of four colonial dioceses, that of Adelaide being among the
number. The preferment to the latter see fell to the Rev.
Augustus Short, D.D., who, with the three other bishops, was
consecrated in Westminster Abbey on the 29th of June, 1847, the
occasion being one of unusual solemnity, the ceremony lasting
over four hours. In December of that year Dr. Short arrived in
Adelaide, and was formally inducted at Trinity Church, when her
Majesty's letters patent were read, constituting South Australia
a diocese, and "appointing Dr. Short to be the bishop thereof,
under the style and title of Lord Bishop of Adelaide."</p>
<p>He arrived in critical times, while the Church and State storm
was raging, and of course every step he took was watched with
eager and jealous eyes. Before he had been long in Adelaide, the
bishop, acting upon advice given to him before leaving England,
and furnished with a formal land grant under the hand and seal of
the Governor, proceeded to claim an acre of ground in Victoria
Square as a site for a cathedral. But he had reckoned without his
host. The local authorities declared that the document was
<i>ultra vires</i>, and legal proceedings were commenced. For
years the case dragged its weary length along, and it was not
until 1855 that the Supreme Court decreed that Dr. Short could
not enforce his claim, it being held that, though the Governor
could grant waste lands, he could not interfere with the public
reserves, of which Victoria Square was one.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of August, 1848, Colonel Robe took leave of the
Legislative Council, and in concluding his speech said, "In
relinquishing the duties which have devolved upon me under the
appointment of her Majesty, I look to my Sovereign alone for any
expression of approbation."</p>
<p>This was highly characteristic of the man. As an officer in
the army he had learnt to obey orders to the letter, and expected
prompt and submissive obedience from those over whom he was
placed in authority. But he had found that the free subjects of a
free colony would not submit to be treated as subalterns in the
army, and, this being the case, he had wisely altered his manner
and plans of procedure long before his removal from the colony.
Although from his previous habits the position of Governor was
not congenial, the knowledge and experience which length of
residence gave him, both of the country and people, led him to
become greatly attached to both, and his despatches for some time
previous to his departure manifested the warm interest he took in
the rise and progress of South Australia.</p>
<p>With all his official faults he was a man of stern
inflexibility of character, and of a high sense of duty; a master
in official routine, and a prince in hospitality.</p>
<p>Not a few, both in the colony and at home, would have liked to
see Colonel Gawler restored to the post from which he had been so
hastily and ungenerously recalled. Mr. G. Fife Angas was one of
these, and in a letter to Earl Grey, under date 2nd of June,
1847, he says&mdash;</p>
<p>"If Major Robe is about to remove to the Mauritius, it would
afford a gracious opportunity to restore Colonel Gawler to South
Australia. His noble and distinguished conduct there, by which he
laid the foundation of its future prosperity under the judicious
government of Governor Grey, has not been well understood in this
country, and thereby great injustice has been done to that
upright and sensible officer. He would be sure to meet with a
popular reception, the more so were he to be the bearer of a
Constitution founded on simple, practical, and liberal
principles. . . .</p>
<p>"The colonists justly complain," added Mr. Angas, "of the
frequent change of their Governors as being very injurious. No
sooner does one become acquainted with the localities and the
people, and they with him, and a cordial feeling has sprung up on
both sides, than he is removed&mdash;a system which, if pursued
in principle by a great mercantile house in the management of its
foreign establishments, would involve it in confusion and
ruin."</p>
<p>The wish for Colonel Gawler to be reinstated was not
gratified, but in the successor to Major Robe the colonists found
an ideal Governor and a man after their own hearts.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> emigrant ship <i>Forfarshire</i> arrived
off the lightship on the 1st of August, 1848, with Sir Henry
Edward Fox Young and Lady Young on board. Unfortunately, through
inadvertence, no pilot was in readiness to board the ship, not a
Government boat was at hand, nor a solitary head of any
Government department present to receive the new Governor. On
arriving at Government House there was, through another
negligence, neither guard of honour to receive him, nor any
members of the Executive to bid him welcome. It was a cold
reception, but it was amply atoned for afterwards.</p>
<p>Sir Henry Edward Fox Young was the son of Colonel Sir Aretas
William Young, and was born at Brabourne, near Ashford, Kent, on
the 23rd of April, 1810, being named after his godfather, General
Edward Henry Fox, brother of the Whig statesman, the celebrated
rival of Pitt.</p>
<p>Sir Henry was educated at Dean's School, Bromley, Middlesex,
and was intended for the Bar, but on quitting school he joined
his father at Trinidad, and received an appointment in the
colonial treasury in that island. This, rapidly followed by other
colonial promotions, prevented him from being called to the Bar.
At Demerara he served under Sir Benjamin D'Urban as aide-de-camp,
and was then promoted to St. Lucia, where for a time he filled
the several offices of secretary, treasurer, and puisne judge of
the Supreme Court of Justice. He was then transferred back again
to Demerara, and later on, was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of
the eastern districts of the Cape of Good Hope, whither, a few
weeks before, Sir Henry Pottinger had been despatched as Governor
and High Commissioner for the settlement of Kaffraria. The Kaffir
War was unexpectedly renewed a few weeks after his embarkation
from England, and the Home Government, under the impression that
a civil Lieutenant-Governor could not under these circumstances
be required, removed Sir Henry Young to South Australia without
waiting for the report of Sir Henry Pottinger from the seat of
war, whose despatches endeavoured to frustrate any intention to
remove Sir Henry Young, and recommended that, notwithstanding the
breaking out of war, the services of the civil
Lieutenant-Governor should be continued, as his services had been
very valuable at Grahamstown during the brief period (some eight
months) in which he had remained in that position.</p>
<p>A fortnight before leaving England, Sir Henry married Augusta
Sophia, daughter of Mr. Charles Marryat, and niece of Captain
Marryat, R.N., the well-known novelist and author of the code of
signals bearing his name.</p>
<p>The day after his arrival, Sir Henry Young was introduced to
the members of Council, and received an address of welcome and
congratulation from the colonists. In his reply he pointed out
that the sphere of official government was wisely limited, and
that the numerous methods of social advancement in all free
countries should derive their origin, maintenance, and progress
from the energies and resources of private individuals. In this
connection he spoke of the importance of diffusing scientific
information applicable to agriculture, wool-growing, and
such-like industries, more particularly calling attention to the
mining interests, which would be enhanced by the formation of
self-supporting voluntary associations to receive, record, and
arrange any accounts and specimens transmitted to them of mining
operations, and thus preserve valuable facts that might otherwise
be lost to practical science. It was evident from the first that
"progress" was the key-note of his administration.</p>
<p>On the 9th of August the Legislative Council assembled to hear
and act upon a despatch from Lord Grey, calling attention to the
insufficient salary attached to the office of Governor, and
"strongly recommending that an increase of &pound;500 per annum
should be made to the salary of the present Lieutenant-Governor,
raising it to &pound;2000 per annum." A Bill was brought in
accordingly, which passed through its several stages on the 15th
of August, and secured the much-needed addition.</p>
<p>The first public step of the new Governor was a bold and
politic one. It was no less than a notification in the Government
<i>Gazette</i> that, pending the further signification of her
Majesty's pleasure, the imposition of royalties on mineral lands
would be suspended, and not inserted in future land-grants. This
gratifying information gave the most profound satisfaction, and
Sir Henry was overwhelmed with the thanks of the colonists.</p>
<p>The formal authorization of the step by the Secretary of State
was not officially announced until July of the following year,
and if, as is supposed, the relinquishment of the royalty dues
was taken on the Governor's own initiative, it was a step almost
unprecedented in its boldness.</p>
<p>One of the early questions demanding his attention was a
proposal from the Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners,
approved by the Secretary of State, to receive "certain classes
of orphans of both sexes in Ireland, between the ages of fourteen
and eighteen." The Commissioners and Lord Grey considered that
these orphans, at that time maintained in Irish work-houses,
would keep up the supply of labour required in the colony. Little
did the colonists imagine the extent to which the plan proposed
would be carried out, nor were they desirous that any immigration
of the kind should be confined to the Irish. But, as there were
no valid objections to urge, they assented, and a committee was
appointed for the protection and guardianship of the orphans. The
committee included Dr. Short, Bishop of Adelaide, Dr. Murphy,
Roman Catholic Bishop, and representatives of the Nonconformist
bodies. It was unfortunate that at about this time there was a
large addition to the population of the colony. In one week in
December no fewer than 1131 persons arrived, about 600 of whom
had paid their own passages, the remainder being Government
emigrants. To assist newly arrived immigrants and others in
obtaining employment, the Colonial Labour Office was opened early
in the following year (1849), under the direction of a committee,
and was supported in the first instance by subscriptions, as no
fees were charged for arranging engagements. It was found a great
accommodation to both employers and employed.</p>
<p>This rapid influx of immigrants was the beginning of what was
to be hereafter a source of considerable trouble. Owing to the
unsuitable class of persons sent out, it soon became necessary to
find relief for the destitute poor, and a Board was appointed to
take the matter up. The first shipload of Irish orphan girls
arrived in June, 1849. They were kindly received and accommodated
with lodgings in the Native School location on the North Park
Lands, and were visited by a committee of ladies who advised them
as to their future.</p>
<p>When, in November, 1848, the Governor opened the Legislative
Council, hopes were entertained that he would have made some
important revelation with regard to a new Constitution for the
colony, but instead he stated it to be merely his intention to
forward certain Bills left undisposed of by his predecessor, and
to introduce a Bill for the guardianship and apprenticeship of
orphan immigrants. But he made a statement in which he
foreshadowed his whole policy:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It only remains for me, on the first occasion of transacting
ordinary business with the Council," he said, "to give my sincere
assurance that whether the lapse of time that may occur before
representative institutions be conceded to South Australia be
long or short, and my wish is that it may be but brief, I am
cordially desirous, as far as my power extends, to join with this
Council as now constituted only in such legislation as shall be
in unison with the general opinion of the colonists"&mdash;a
policy in direct opposition to that of his predecessor.</p>
<p>The real work of the Legislative Council under the new
Governor did not commence until the 4th of July, 1849. In opening
the Council the Governor read an elaborate minute of a very
satisfactory character, in which he announced the payment to the
emigration fund of &pound;56,746 from the Crown reserved moiety
of the land fund, thus extinguishing a long-standing technical
claim.</p>
<p>The estimated expenditure for the following year (1850) was
stated to be &pound;108,555.</p>
<p>From the item of imports and exports it appeared that, for the
first time since the foundation of the colony, the exports
exceeded the imports, the latter being valued at &pound;471,556,
and the former at &pound;485,951 (including sixteen thousand tons
of ore).</p>
<p>In the early part of the previous year the citizens had
petitioned for a resuscitation of the Corporation, and it was
anticipated that this would be the main business of the session.
In introducing it the Governor said, "The Bill to constitute a
municipal Corporation for the city of Adelaide, and the Bill to
provide a general board for the care and maintenance of the lines
of roads, with local election boards for the management of the
district or cross roads, are framed on so popular a basis as to
be fit precursors of that more general system of representative
government, the concession of which has been usually preceded by
some experience of the working of civic, or parochial, or
district municipalities."</p>
<p>Sir Henry Young, unlike his predecessor, knew exactly how to
secure popularity. From the date of his first public utterances
he laid it down as a matter of duty as well as of inclination to
adhere to that line of policy which should frame all legislation
in unison with the deliberate opinion of the majority of the
colonists.</p>
<p>In concluding his speech on this occasion he reiterated that
policy, and added, "Let us, then, whose mission it is, as a
Legislature, to nurse this infant community in its advance
towards the rank of a nation, so act for the permanent interests
of present and future time, that our successors shall not be able
to associate our proceedings with the origin of any short-sighted
or illiberal measures. In this honourable and responsible aim it
will be my pride cordially to afford you my best
co-operation."</p>
<p>On the 24th of September the long-looked-for new Constitution,
for the Australian colonies generally, arrived in the
<i>Grecian</i>, and supplied plenty of work for the Legislature
and the public.</p>
<p>The Bill first provided for the separation of the district of
Port Phillip from the colony of New South Wales, and the boundary
of the new colony of Victoria. The Legislative Councils to be
established in each colony were next determined. These bodies
were limited to twenty-four members, two-thirds of whom were to
be elected, and the remaining third nominated. Power was then
given to make laws, to raise taxes and appropriate public money,
and to establish district councils after the formation of
Legislative Councils. Further power was given to establish a
General Assembly for the Australian colonies; and, lastly, with
the assent of her Majesty in Council, to alter the constitution
of the respective Legislative Councils, if necessary.</p>
<p>The most important features of this Bill were, of course, the
grand federal idea set forth in the clauses for the establishment
and guidance of the General Assembly, and the power to alter the
constitution of the Legislative Councils. In regard to the latter
the Bill provided that it should be lawful for the Governor and
Legislative Council of each colony, after the establishment of
the Legislative Council stipulated for by the Bill, to alter from
time to time, by any Act or Acts, "the provisions or laws for
the-time being in force under this Act, or otherwise concerning
the election of the elective members of such Legislative Councils
respectively, the qualification of electors and elective members,
and generally to vary in any manner not hereinbefore authorized
the constitution of such Legislative Councils respectively, or to
establish in the said colonies respectively, instead of the
Legislative Councils, a Council and a House of Representatives or
other separate legislative houses, to consist respectively of
such members to be appointed or elected respectively by such
persons and in such manner as by such Act or Acts shall be
determined, and to vest in such Council and House of
Representatives or other separate legislative houses the powers
and functions of the legislative Council for which the same may
be substituted, provided always that every Bill which shall be
passed by the Council in any of the said colonies, for any of
such purposes, shall be reserved for the signification of her
Majesty's pleasure thereon; and a copy of such Bill shall be laid
before both Houses of Parliament for the space of thirty days at
the least before her Majesty's pleasure thereon shall be
signified."</p>
<p>We have given this prosy quotation in full, as it sets forth
in exact terms the "case" on which, in the near future, ten
thousand arguments were to be founded.</p>
<p>The clause providing for the establishment of the General
Assembly set forth that it should be lawful for the
Governor-General "to convene, at such time or times and at such
place within any of the said colonies as such Governor-General
shall from time to time think fit to appoint, a General Assembly
for all the said colonies, to be called 'The General Assembly of
Australia', which said General Assembly shall consist of such
Governor-General and a House of Delegates, and such House of
Delegates shall consist of members to be elected by the
respective Legislative Councils of the said colonies of New South
Wales, Victoria, Van Diemen's Land, and South Australia in the
proportion following; that is to say, two members from each of
the said colonies for every 15,000 inhabitants thereof, the
number of the inhabitants being calculated according to last
authentic enumeration at the date of the election, and such
members shall be elected and all laws to be made and enacted by
such Assembly shall be made and enacted and the business of such
Assembly shall be conducted in such manner and form, and subject
to such rules and conditions, as her Majesty by Order in Council
shall direct, provided always that the first convocation of such
Assembly shall have received from the Legislative Councils
established under the said firstly recited Act of the sixth year
of her Majesty, or this Act, of two or more of the said colonies,
addresses requesting such Governor-General to convene such
Assembly."</p>
<p>Other powers and provisions followed, which it is not
necessary to record here.</p>
<p>Long before the colonists were called upon to give expression
to their opinions on this federal scheme, Mr. G.F. Angas, in a
letter to Earl Grey, of which the following is an extract, had
very fairly represented their views:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="right"><small>"2, Jeffrey's Square, St. Mary Axe, 4th
of July, 1849.</small>   </p>
<p>"Time does not press with the federal government question
because the habits, disposition, social condition, and
productions of each colony are so diverse, the distances so
great, and the means of conveyance so few and inconvenient, while
the aggregate population is so small, that for twenty years to
come it will be quite impracticable to work out the scheme of a
General Assembly. Until the three or four young colonies become
more advanced in population, wealth, and social progress, and get
experience in the working of their separate political
institutions, it is not very improbable that the attempt to form
a General Assembly would embroil the whole of them in discord and
dissatisfaction with each other, and with the parent State. The
four new colonies would be swamped by the two older penal ones,
and, as public opinion at present exists, they could not agree
upon the locality and measures required by a General
Assembly."</p>
<p>The first to take action in the colony on the new Constitution
was Mr. J. Morphett, who submitted to the Governor a series of
resolutions which were published in the Government
<i>Gazette</i>, as the Council was not then sitting. These
resolutions affirmed that "it is essential to the welfare of this
colony that the Imperial Parliament should, in framing a
Constitution for South Australia, adopt the principle of
municipal government, adhering, as far as the different ages of
the two places would admit of it, to the form and system of the
Government of Great Britain"; that is, a Governor and two
chambers, one in the nature of an Upper Chamber with hereditary
members nominated by her Majesty, and a Second Chamber to consist
of members elected by the people.</p>
<p>These resolutions were added to and amended in a committee of
the Legislative Council, and at the same time emphatic motions
were passed against the proposed federal scheme, on the ground
that it was inexpedient, inasmuch as there was a great
dissimilarity in the pursuits and interests of the several
provinces, that the overwhelming preponderance the larger
provinces would have in the Assembly would be greatly injurious
to the lesser, and that there was no point, so far as could be
seen, upon which benefit would accrue to any of the provinces by
the establishment of such an Assembly.</p>
<p>Out of doors the views of the colonists took this form. They
were grateful to Earl Grey, Mr. Hawes, Lord John Russell, Mr.
Labouchere, and the members of the House of Commons who had
brought in the Bill, and so far as the concession of a
representative government for South Australia was concerned they
hailed it as a wise, liberal, and comprehensive measure. But they
drew the line there, and protested vigorously against a General
Assembly of the Australian colonies, or a federal union, as
unconstitutional and endangering colonial independence, and
maintained that, as they were prepared to bear the whole expenses
of their civil government, they had a constitutional right to
regulate, by means of their representatives in council, the mode
of raising and appropriating the colonial revenue, free from all
control of her Majesty's Treasury.</p>
<p>The discussions on the formation of a Constitution were varied
by lengthy debates on roads and road-making, as a Road Bill
passed through the Legislature at this time, and a Central Board
was appointed for carrying it into effect. We shall not, however,
concern ourselves with details of the ordinary course of
legislation in this place, but proceed to tell the whole story of
the new Constitution.</p>
<p>The rule of Sir Henry Young was an era of progression.
Settlers were now more or less settled&mdash;prosperity had set
in&mdash;and the colonists, losing sight of their own immediate
and personal interests, were now directing their attention more
than they had ever done before to the good of the colony as a
whole, and to the duty of "making a nation". They could not have
had a better leader than Sir Henry Young&mdash;a man of broad
mind, liberal views, great intellectual capacity, and withal a
thorough friend to free institutions.</p>
<p>The somewhat unpopular rule of his predecessor, Major Robe,
had not been an unmitigated evil. It aroused in the colonists a
determination to stand together and fight for their political
rights, and it awakened, even in the most indifferent, a spirit
of sturdy independence. The times were ripe for action, and with
the Hour came the Man.</p>
<p>Ideas were developing apace. As the time drew near to elect
representative members for the new Legislative Council, the
advocates of popular, or democratic, principles strained every
nerve to obtain as large an infusion as possible into the new
body of the element they considered most essential to their own
welfare. An "Elective Franchise Association" was formed, with
this astounding platform&mdash;universal suffrage, vote by
ballot, annual elections, no property qualification for
representatives, and no nominee members! Later on in the year the
"South Australian Political Association" was formed, and in a
short time it had branches in various parts of the colony, its
programme being mainly the advocacy of universal suffrage and the
ballot. The formation of the association marked an epoch in the
political history of the colony. From the first it excited a
powerful influence, which increased as the years went on, and
many elections in some of the most important constituencies were
decided by its action, the conservative element being threatened,
if not with extinction, at least with paralysis of its power.</p>
<p>The year 1851 opened with active preparations for popular
representative government, and the <i>Ascendant</i>, the vessel
that was to bring out the new Constitution, was awaited with
feverish anxiety. A curious story attaches to this episode. In
that same vessel Mr. George Fife Angas, one of the fathers and
founders of the colony, and the originator of the South
Australian Company, left England to take up his residence on his
large estates in the Barossa District. It had been an ambition of
his to be the personal bearer to the colony of the official copy
of the New Constitution Act, and application was made to the
Colonial Office to this end; but it was found to be contrary to
precedent and red-tape triumphed, the important document being
sent from the Colonial Office in charge of a clerk, who was
instructed to take it on board the <i>Ascendant</i> and deliver
it into the hands of the captain. But he had gone ashore, and as
the ship was on the point of sailing, the clerk, either through
negligence or from not understanding the importance of the papers
with which he was entrusted, gave the package to a steward, who,
being very busy, thrust it into the nearest place of safety. The
ship sailed, and if the captain gave a thought to the matter at
all, he merely supposed that there had been some delay or fresh
arrangements had been made. On arrival in Adelaide, the proper
authorities came on board to demand their Constitution and
receive it with due honour, for advices from England had informed
them that it would arrive in the <i>Ascendant</i>. The captain,
of course, protested that he had seen nothing of it, and there
was a great hue and cry for the lost Constitution, until one day
shortly after, in turning out the captain's soiled linen for the
laundress, it was found, to the great amusement of every one, at
the bottom of the bag, where the steward had hurriedly placed it
for security! **</p>
<p class="foot">[** Quoted in "Life of George Fife Angas."]</p>
<p>The "Act for the Better Government of her Majesty's Australian
Colonies" was received with elaborate explanatory despatches,
followed, a short time afterwards, by an announcement of the
appointment by her Majesty of Sir Charles Augustus Fitzroy,
knight, to be Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of South
Australia, and of Sir Henry Young to be Lieutenant-Governor, a
title he had held throughout, but which was now to be held upon a
different tenure. It will be remembered that it was assumed by
Major Robe for prudential reasons, namely, to prevent his
predecessor, Captain Grey, from becoming liable for any of his
dishonoured bills; now it was to be held in prospect of the
federal scheme which had been propounded. As, however, the
Australian colonies were not ripe for this movement, no further
steps were taken, and Sir Charles Fitzroy never attempted to
exercise any control over his lieutenant or over the colony.</p>
<p>A <i>Gazette Extraordinary</i> was issued proclaiming the new
Constitution, and immediately afterwards the first candidate for
legislative honours (Mr. F.S. Dutton) entered the field, followed
by several other leading and influential men. Meanwhile the
Council was called together, and the "Bill to establish the
Legislative Council of South Australia, and to provide for the
Election of Members to serve in the same," was passed on the 21st
of February. The new Legislative Council was to be composed of
twenty-four members instead of eight as heretofore, of whom eight
were to be nominated by the Crown, and sixteen members were to be
elected by electoral bodies. And this, it was hinted, was by no
means a final measure of reform.</p>
<p>In the course of his valedictory address to the old Council,
the Governor said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"As there is no probability of this Council being again
assembled, I cannot refrain from making one observation before we
separate. Your successors, gentlemen, will have a field of
universal extent and of universal responsibility, . . . yet the
colonial annals cannot fail to record that the prosperity which,
with the continuance of the Divine blessing, it may be the happy
privilege of a new legislation to preserve, to develop, and to
augment, took its rise and acquired a character of stability
under the sway of the present Council. This is a distinction and
a satisfaction of which you can never be deprived.</p>
<p>"It is permanently useful, too, as affording an incentive to
your successors to take care that the public resources receive at
their hands, not only no detriment, but universal
productiveness."</p>
<p>Up to the time of the elections the Political Association, the
Ballot Association, and the League for the Maintenance of
Religious Freedom displayed great activity, holding meetings in
various parts of the colony, with a view to secure
representatives favourable to their claims. Without doubt, these
societies exercised a considerable influence on the elections. A
committee was formed, by whom the following questions were
prepared and submitted to every candidate:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. "Are you in favour of, and would you vote for, the adoption
of the ballot at elections?"</p>
<p>2. "Are you in favour of State grants for the support of
religion, or would you strenuously oppose such a measure?"</p>
<p>3. "In the event of your being returned as our representative,
how far would you extend the suffrage?"</p>
<p>4 "Would you use your utmost endeavours to obtain the
constitution of an Assembly strictly representative, as opposed
to nomination?"</p>
<p>5. "As to the duration of Legislative Councils, would you
limit them to three years, or what are your views on this
head?"</p>
<p>These questions were the means of eliciting considerable
information from the candidates to whom they were addressed,
placed the constituencies in a good position as to their men, and
regulated mainly their course of action.</p>
<p>The League, in a large measure, acted independently, directing
the full force of its energy to securing candidates pledged to
oppose, tooth and nail, any State grant in aid of religion. Some
recent events in Church circles had been favourable to the
leaguers. While the lawsuit with regard to the site of the
cathedral was still pending, popular feeling was further excited
in consequence of the bishop having met the other colonial
prelates and attached his signature to a minute affirming the
doctrine of baptismal regeneration, which the Bishop of Melbourne
had refused to sign. A great public demonstration by members of
the Church of England followed, when the course pursued by Bishop
Short was almost unanimously condemned in the strongest language.
Before the storm had died away, the elections came on, and
capital was made out of the conduct of the Bishop.</p>
<p>After innumerable meetings in nearly every part of the colony,
the elections began on the 2nd of July, when the most profound
interest in the proceedings was displayed, eager crowds thronging
the gaily decorated polling booths, while more active partisans
paraded the streets with banners, trumpets, and shawms.</p>
<p>To show how successful the League had been in these elections,
it may be stated that, out of sixteen districts, only four
candidates were returned favourable to Government support to
religion.</p>
<p>The question next in importance was, of course, with regard to
the Constitution to be framed by the new Council, or, at any
rate, to be initiated by it.</p>
<p>When, on the 28th of August, the new Council * met in the new
Court House in Victoria Square, an eager throng of spectators
crowded the approaches, to witness as much as possible of the
inauguration of the new Legislature.</p>

<p>It was confessedly only an experiment, and the Imperial
Government, in its wisdom, had placed in the hands of the members
the power of introducing such modifications as might be
necessary, although, as the Governor in his opening address
observed, it was desirable that such a trial of the present
Constitution should be given as would show that any modifications
to be proposed hereafter should be to remedy "proved
inconveniences and not merely theoretical requirements."</p>
<p>The Governor was able to report to the new Council that the
general condition of the colony was in all respects satisfactory.
The population was 63,700, exclusive of 3730 aborigines. The
excess of immigration over emigration during the year was 6137.
The imports were in value &pound;887,423, or about &pound;13
18<i>s</i>. per head; the exports, &pound;571,348, or more than
&pound;8 19<i>s</i>. per head. There were 102 places of worship
in the colony, and 115 schools; 174,000 acres of land were
inclosed, and 15,000 square miles of Crown land occupied by
squatters and depastured by sheep and cattle. The export of wool
was 3,289,232 lbs., and the export of copper metal 44,594 cwt.,
and of copper ore 8784 tons. The sum of &pound;140,000 was named
in the estimates as the amount required for public works. Drafts
of various laws were laid before the members, priority being
given to the question of the continuance of aid from the public
treasury to the erection of Christian churches and to the support
of Christian ministers, the enactment for it having terminated on
the previous 31st of March, after a three years' trial.</p>
<p>An Education Bill, as well as measures for giving enlarged
powers to district boards, was also in the programme for the
session, whose subsequent meetings, by the way, were held in the
Council Chamber on North Terrace.</p>
<p>On the 29th of August the hour arrived for which the large
majority of colonists had anxiously waited for more than three
years&mdash;that is to say, ever since the date of the ill-judged
action of Major Robe&mdash;when Mr. Gwynne rose to move the first
reading of a Bill to continue "an Ordinance to promote the
Building of Churches and Chapels for Christian Worship, and to
provide for the Maintenance of Ministers of the Christian
Religion." This was the signal for the great battle of the
session to commence; but the opponents of the grant were
determined to make the contest as brief and decisive as possible,
and moved, as an amendment to its first reading, that "it be read
that day six months."</p>
<p>This was carried by a majority of three, there being thirteen
for the amendment and ten against it, the votes of all the
members, with one exception, having been recorded on this
important question. The arguments of the victorious party were
briefly these:&mdash;</p>
<p>That all mankind have a natural and indefeasible right to
worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own
consciences, and no man can, of right, be compelled to attend,
erect, or support any place of worship, or to maintain any
ministry against his consent; that no human authority can, in any
case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of
conscience; that no preference shall ever be given by law to any
religious establishment or modes of worship; that no part of the
revenue from the colony of South Australia, from whatever source
it may arise, and that no part of the land and emigration funds,
can be made applicable to the support of ministers or teachers of
any religion or to the erection or repairing of any place of
worship.</p>
<p>To supply the place of the Government stipends, it was
necessary that some new machinery should be invented, and to this
end the Bishop addressed a minute to the Church Society. In reply
he received a report projecting and recommending a constitution
for the Church, to consist of a diocesan assembly, composed
partly of clergymen and partly of lay representatives chosen by
the various Churches. This plan was adopted, but it was found
almost as difficult to frame a constitution for the Church as the
Legislature found it to be for the colony. When at length it
<i>was</i> framed, the next aim of the Bishop was to obtain for
it the force of law; but in this he signally failed, and the
whole project fell through, notwithstanding the fact that a fresh
newspaper, the <i>Adelaide Morning Chronicle</i>, was called into
existence to advocate the claims of the friends of State aid to
religion.</p>
<p>So decisive was the blow struck in that ever-to-be-remembered
Council of 1851, that no attempt has again been made to introduce
into the colonial Parliament the question of State aid to
religion, and through the long years that have passed it has been
found that the voluntary principle then adopted was best suited
to the genius of the people. Amazing efforts were made by all
denominations to supply the religious wants of their respective
communities; the colony became remarkable for the number of its
places of worship in proportion to the population; the Church of
England, which, of all other Churches, deprecated the voluntary
principle, found, on giving it a fair trial, that sufficient
funds could be raised from private sources to build their
churches and pay their ministers.</p>
<p>With the discontinuance of the Government grant in aid of
religion came a measure for the promotion of education, providing
for stipends to teachers, assistance in the erection of
school-houses, and other regulations, the whole of which were to
be under the control and management of a Board of Education.</p>
<p>One clause of the Bill provided that no minister of religion
should be a member of this Board&mdash;a clause of which the
Governor so highly disapproved that he sent a message to the
Council urging that it should be rescinded. This interference the
Council resented, and carried the Bill as previously passed by a
majority of six.</p>
<p>Soon after this Education Bill was passed, the South
Australian Preceptors' Association was formed, its object being
to elevate the standard of education by the improvement of the
educator, and to obtain a higher social grade for the teacher, so
that the scholastic profession should have as recognized a
position as the clerical, legal, and medical professions.</p>
<p>This first session of the Legislative Council under the new
Constitution was perhaps the most important in the history of the
colony, as it set at rest for ever the question of Church and
State, and it inaugurated a system of public education which,
with necessary modifications to suit the exigencies of the times,
has continued almost to the present day. Among the less important
items of the session were the City and Port Railway Bill, which
was passed on the 25th of September; and the offering of a
premium for any steamer or sailing vessel landing mails and
passengers within sixty-seven days from Britain = &pound;250 if
landed at Nepean Bay, and &pound;400 if landed at Port Adelaide;
the total amount not to exceed &pound;5000 in any one year.</p>
<p>An important discussion also took place on the question of
annuities or pensions to Government officials. In consequence of
Captain Sturt, the great explorer, who was also the colonial
secretary, wishing to retire from public life, it was moved that
a sum should be placed on the estimates as a suitable testimonial
for the important services he had rendered by the discovery of
the colony, and to provide for his comfortable retirement from
public life.</p>
<p>Mr. G.F. Angas moved an amendment to the effect that a Bill be
introduced "for the purpose of granting an annuity for life to
the Hon. Captain Sturt, and that the proposed Bill have a clause
inserted in it declaring that it is not to be considered as a
precedent for retiring pensions to official persons in South
Australia"&mdash;a system, said Mr. Angas, "servile in itself and
calculated to induce improvidence." The amendment was carried by
a majority of ten to six, and eventually the sum of &pound;600
per annum was secured to the gallant captain&mdash;an act of
liberality honourable to the colony, and bestowed upon one well
worthy of such a token of regard.</p>
<p>While these things were going on in the Legislature there were
matters out of doors which threatened mischief. The winter had
been long and inclement; great distress existed among the working
classes; the prices of provisions were unusually high, and few
public works were in hand, the estimates having been long
delayed. Moreover events were pending unprecedented in the
world's history, and destined to affect the whole future of the
Australian colonies.</p>
<p>In 1849 an emigration of the male adult population had been
threatened, when the news arrived of gold being discovered in
large quantities in California; but the first vessel laid on at
Adelaide (the <i>Mazeppa</i>) only took about twenty passengers.
The exodus was renewed in January, 1850, when two ships cleared
out for California, followed by others in February and March, and
conveying five hundred and seventy passengers in all. Happily
these departures relieved the colony of many who could well be
spared. From all the Australian colonies large numbers of
doubtful characters were drained off to the Californian diggings,
and this led the people of Van Diemen's Land to seize the
opportunity and take steps to enlist the sympathies of the
Australian colonies generally to save them from the further
transportation of felons to their shores. An Anti-Transportation
League was established in Tasmania, and South Australia, with New
South Wales and Victoria, were invited to join and co-operate.
The South Australians were quite ready and willing to do this,
and at once sent some of their picked men to represent them in
the League.</p>
<p>This League may be regarded as the first great federal action
of the colonies named. One other colony, Western Australia, not
only held aloof, but, while the four other colonies were striving
to be relieved from the galling burden of convictism, she had
servilely petitioned for the yoke, and the first shipload had
been actually landed on her shores in answer to her prayers. In
September, 1851, the delegates from the "Australian Conference
for the Discontinuance of Transportation" arrived in Adelaide. A
crowded meeting was held for their reception, and the colonists
pledged themselves not to employ any persons thenceforth who
might arrive in the province under sentence of transportation for
crime committed in Europe; to prevent by all lawful means the
establishment of English prisons or penal settlements; not only
to refuse assent to any projects to facilitate the administration
of such penal settlements, but to seek the repeal of all
regulations and establishments for the purpose; and, finally, to
support by countenance, advice, and money, all who might suffer
in the promotion of this cause.</p>
<p>The feeling had become strong and fairly general that the
total cessation of transportation to the colonies was essential
to their honour, happiness, and prosperity, and that to secure
this desideratum it was necessary that the Australian colonies
should join in one great confederation to obtain deliverance from
this curse of civilization, and, as we shall see, it was not long
before this great end was practically obtained. Of course, having
taken this important step. South Australia could not with any
show of consistency continue to transport its own felons to Van
Diemen's Land, and a measure was therefore adopted for the
employment of convicts within the province, who should henceforth
be sentenced to hard labour instead of "transportation beyond the
seas". This led to the establishment of a stockade at Cox's
Creek, and, subsequently, of the Labour Prison at the Dry
Creek.</p>
<p>While these matters were going on, while excitement was
running high on the questions brought forward in the new
Legislative Council, already chronicled in this chapter, news
reached the colony of the increasing richness of the gold
discoveries in New South Wales, and of the still greater yield of
the more recently found gold-fields in Victoria. At once there
was a stampede of such working men in South Australia as could
raise sufficient money for their passage and outfit, and they
left for Victoria, at first by fifties, then by hundreds, and at
last by thousands.</p>
<p>Soon after the exodus commenced, Mr. J.M. Solomon advocated
following the example of Victoria and offering a reward for the
discovery of a workable and paying gold-field in South Australia,
and &pound;300 was guaranteed by private subscription; while the
Legislative Council not only determined to permit licences to be
issued for the search for gold on unsold waste lands, and also to
appropriate a sum of money for a geological survey of the colony,
but offered &pound;1000 for the discovery of a gold-field in the
colony, the produce of which in two months should amount to
&pound;10,000. To this there was a poor response&mdash;a bird in
the hand, like the Victoria fields, was considered to be better
than half a dozen in the bush&mdash;and the exodus continued. "It
is perhaps no exaggeration to say," said the report of the
Chamber of Commerce for 1851, "that at least 15,000 to 20,000
individuals left South Australia during the prevalence of the
gold mania," and this included the greater part of the most
useful labourers, involving a cessation of almost all industrial
production.</p>
<p>On the 27th of November a notice appeared in the <i>Adelaide
Times</i>, stating that after the next issue it would be
published weekly instead of daily, "in consequence of the falling
off of business and the departures for the diggings." One by one
the other papers were stopped, until the <i>Register</i>,
<i>Observer</i>, <i>Times</i>, and <i>Morning Chronicle</i> were
left the sole representatives of the press.</p>
<p>In 1852 came a crisis in the history of the colony. An
abundant harvest had been gathered in with some difficulty, owing
to the scarcity of labour; and hundreds of gold-diggers had
returned with their rich gains and findings. But, with a surfeit
of wealth, it could not be put into circulation. The banks had
been drained of coin by the numbers who had left the colony, and
with the absorption of a medium of circulation there came a
stagnation of trade, and with it the discharge of nearly all
those employed who had not voluntarily left their occupations and
pursuits to proceed to the diggings. It thus happened that there
was not in many instances sufficient business to occupy the time
of even the former employer of labour, and one after another
shops were closed, business suspended, and they too followed in
the general wake and went to the gold-fields. Shepherds left
their flocks in the sheep-yards; stockmen deserted the
cattle-stations; farm labourers abandoned their teams and
ploughs; dairy cows were left to run untended in the bush, and
servants of all classes left their employers. The hands employed
at the Burra-Burra mines were reduced from 1042 to 366, and
subsequently to 100 Pumping engines were stopped, and dry levels
only worked.</p>
<p>Rapidly and extraordinarily the contagion spread. In one week
in January, 1852, no fewer than thirteen Government officers, and
again in one week in February seventeen others, sent in their
resignations. So many persons were leaving the colony in debt
that a Bill was hastily passed to obtain summary payment of small
debts, but it was rendered almost nugatory by the discharge of
officers from the local court.</p>
<p>A great part of the police force resigned, and those who were
left were in a state of disorganization, so that grave fears were
entertained that in distant and unprotected stations the natives
would commit depredations and otherwise become troublesome. For
the city no fears were felt, as the thieves and bad characters
generally had made their way to the diggings, a more lucrative
field for their operations.</p>
<p>But for the intervention of the Chamber of Commerce, many of
the letter-carriers would have been dismissed, at a time, too,
when the business of the post-office was largely increased by the
number of letters passing between the absentees and their
families. Several of the minor departments were left without any
clerical assistance whatever. The Labour Office was removed to
the Port, as if ready to take its departure with those for whose
use it was established. The relieving officer and health officer
were discharged. The Destitute Board, finding that the asylum was
likely to be filled to overflowing with deserted wives and
families, advertised that such as were left behind by men who had
proceeded to the diggings would not be supported. The city
surveyor, the inspector of weights and measures, and many others
were under notice that their services would probably soon be
dispensed with.</p>
<p>The city and suburbs presented a most desolate and forsaken
appearance. Some fifty or sixty shops were closed in Hindley
Street and Rundle Street alone.** Many private houses were
deserted in consequence of the occupants having left the colony,
or, in a great number of cases, because they had joined some
other family, left without its male members, for company and
protection. Sixty women and several families were thrown upon the
asylum despite the notice of the Destitute Board. The Port was
left with only one water-carrier, and Thebarton with only one
man!</p>
<p class="foot">[** On one of these deserted houses the following
facetious notice was posted up for the information of the
tax-gatherer: "Mr. Collector, gone to the diggings, hope to pay
you when I return."]</p>
<p>The great difficulty, putting all others in the shade, was,
however, the want of cash. It was calculated that "each man must
have taken with him on an average ten pounds in specie, to pay
his travelling expenses and provide the necessaries of life until
his labour at the diggings should be productive. This amounted to
a drain of gold sovereigns from the bank vaults. Every bank-note
in the possession of the intending emigrant would be converted
into coin, as the only circulating medium on which he could rely
over the border. Taking the lowest estimate of fifteen thousand
emigrants, this would imply a drain on the banks of
&pound;150,000. Such a drain as this involved the necessity on
the part of the banks of restricting their note circulation, and
of diminishing their discounts of commercial bills, which had the
effect of paralyzing trade, and left the already glutted markets
without purchasers for their commodities." ***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Finniss's "Constitutional History of South
Australia", p. 71.]</p>
<p>Several plans were proposed, such as allowing the banks an
extended circulation; the issue of Government notes having twelve
months' currency; the transmission of gold to England for
conversion into sovereigns, and the assay of gold in the
colony.</p>
<p>The Governor was memorialized to establish the latter, but he
declined to do so, and urged a forbearance of creditors to
debtors as the best remedy for the evil. The managers of the
South Australian Company adopted the plan of taking wheat for
rent, and some few tradesmen took gold-dust for goods, although,
if this system of barter had become universal, the ruin of the
colony, at least for a time, would have been inevitable. As it
was, large numbers were continuing to leave the colony, who would
have remained if there had been trade and employment in
proportion to the gold lying useless.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that the attractions of the gold-fields
were very great, the news from Forest Creek being to the effect
that five Adelaide men had procured no less than 250 lbs. weight
of gold, which, at 60<i>s</i>. per ounce (the price then given in
Adelaide), was worth about &pound;9000. On receipt of this news
thirteen out of the twenty-two vessels in harbour were laid on
for Melbourne.</p>
<p>A letter from a well-known colonist,* written about this time,
gives a graphic picture of the state of affairs:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mrs. Evans, of Evandale, daughter of Mr.
George Fife Angas.]</p>
<br>
<p align="right"><small>"February 25th, 1852.</small>   </p>
<p>"What changes have taken place in this colony since Christmas!
The discovery of gold has turned our little world upside down;
thousands have left the settlement for the diggings. . . . In
Adelaide windows are bricked up, and outside is written, 'Gone to
the diggings.' Vessels are crowded with passengers to Melbourne,
and the road to the Port is like a fair&mdash;ministers,
shopkeepers, policemen, masons, carpenters, clerks, councillors,
labourers, farmers, doctors, lawyers, boys, and even some women,
have gone either by sea or land to try their fortunes at the
diggings. . . . Somewhere about &pound;16,000 worth of gold has
in less than two weeks found its way here. Many have done
uncommonly well, earning &pound;200 perhaps, or more, in a week,
while some have not earned enough to pay for their food. . . . It
is quite ludicrous to see how these labourers spend their gold.
One man bought six silk dresses and six bonnets for his
'missus.'"</p>
<p>Early in the year (1852) one or two far-seeing men, foremost
among whom was Mr. George Tinline, manager of the Bank of South
Australia, became convinced that the assay of gold into stamped
ingots of a fixed value was the only immediate and effectual way
out of the financial difficulty. Again the Governor was
memorialized by the Chamber of Commerce, and also by the
merchants and traders of Port Adelaide, on the subject.</p>
<p>Long, elaborate and ingenious replies were returned, arguing
the position but declining to entertain the proposition. The
following, read in the light of subsequent events, is an
extremely interesting specimen. The Governor directed the
colonial secretary to&mdash;"Acknowledge the receipt of the
memorial urging the local Government to receive, assay, and coin,
that is, stamp gold, as a measure calculated to relieve the
depression of the mercantile and trading community. Say that the
depression under which the colony is labouring is not owing to an
insufficient circulating medium, or to a want of banking
accommodation. Remotely the depression is owing to credit having
been obtained far beyond the value of the article on which that
credit was given. More immediately the depression is owing to a
great diminution or total cessation of the demand for property or
merchandise of any kind resulting from the migration of the
population to the gold diggings. Assaying and stamping gold would
put the metal in a convenient and desirable shape for the
merchants to purchase, and the banks to advance upon, but it
would not relieve the commercial pressure. The discoverer of gold
is no more entitled to claim a mint, or an assay office to give a
circulating fixed value to his gold, than the wool-producer can
demand a manufactory for his raw produce. To give a fixed and
circulating value to gold-dust would make money more plentiful,
but investments of money would not be made here in the absence of
population, or during a drain of it from the colony. The
gold-dust to which additional value is proposed to be given by
affixing to it the character of a circulating medium, would
circulate back again for re-investment in gold-dust, to be again
raised in value by the assay office in Adelaide, during the short
period in which, under these circumstances, an assay office in
the adjacent colonies should be non-existent. Whilst this
additional value was received by gold-dust, and the trade in it
consequently increased, all other kinds of property would still
remain unattractive as investments; for, in the absence of
population, or during the drain of it from the colony, other
investments would yield no current income or profit. In short, if
even sovereigns, instead of gold-dust, were extracted from the
bowels of the earth of the adjacent colonies, these coins would
not be invested in South Australia, because they could be more
profitably invested where the capital would be more productive
than it is at present in this colony, owing to the drain of the
population and the consequent stagnation of all industrial
pursuits. Capital would follow labour. Under present
circumstances, gold brought here is brought by mistake, and must
inevitably go back again. The amount of the currency is fixed or
regulated, not by legislative enactments, but by the natural law
or course of business. In a colony in which trade is conducted
upon an extensive system of credit, every temporary diminution of
capital or wealth has the effect of lessening or annihilating the
demand for, and the consequent value of property, and must be
inevitably followed by a proportionate extent of temporary loss.
The banks have it not in their power to deal with anything more
than the temporarily diminished capital of the community. No
support which they can attempt to afford to the trade in gold
will prevent individual members of the community from
participating in the loss which the colony at large has suffered
by the migration of the population and the temporary stagnation
of trade."</p>
<p>Excellent as, in many respects, the arguments of the Governor
were, he was wise enough to know that the opinions of men better
versed than himself in practical business might be more valuable
than his own, and he never at any time put himself in direct
antagonism to such opinions. Immediately on receipt of the
communication we have quoted above, the Chamber of Commerce again
urged the absolute importance of immediate steps being taken to
meet the crisis which threatened the doom of the colony. The
arguments used were so conclusive, the scheme for carrying out
the proposal so well digested, that a special session of the
Legislative Council was summoned to meet at an early date, "in
order to the enactment of such a measure as may be best
calculated to meet the present emergency."</p>
<p>On the 28th of January the Council met to discuss a Bill to
enable the banks, temporarily, in addition to the notes issued by
them and then in circulation within the province, to issue notes
in exchange for, or to the amount of, any gold bullion purchased
or acquired by the banks, at a fixed rate; to enable persons to
demand from the banks notes in exchange for bullion at a fixed
value; and to make the notes of the banks a legal tender, except
at the banks, so long as the notes were paid on demand in specie
or in bullion. The Bill further provided for the establishment of
an assay office, in order, on payment of the cost of assay, to
facilitate to the banks and other buyers and sellers of bullion,
the ascertaining of the weight and fineness of bullion sent them
for assay, and to constitute such assayed gold, when stamped, a
legal tender.</p>
<p>It was remarkable that the Governor, who had shown so much
shrewdness and capacity on almost every other matter brought
before him for the good of the colony, was still opposed to this
somewhat daring scheme, and in his address to the Council he
stated:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The banking, commercial, trading:, and other moneyed classes
of the community, and also my official advisers in Council,
concur in the utility of the specific measure now introduced.
Whilst my unaltered views, as already published in replies to the
memorials that have been presented to me, do not coincide with
the common expectations that legislation can be made, or will
prove, a means of speedy and general relief to the existing
depression, my judgment is nevertheless entirely satisfied that
the present measure is alike safe and innocuous, and confers on
the colonists of South Australia only an approximation to the
advantages, as regards the possession of bullion, which holders
of that commodity would obtain on application at the British
Mint."</p>
<p>After the address the Council at once proceeded to the sole
and important business of the special session, and the Bullion
Bill was read a first, second, and third time, passed, and
assented to, on the same day!</p>
<p>Of course in assenting to this Bill the Governor took upon
himself an enormous responsibility, and ran the chance of an
immediate recall, but he was not the first Governor who had
exercised discretionary power at a critical time, and, as we
shall see, his action met with the warm approval of the Home
Government.</p>
<p>"The responsibility assumed by Sir Henry Young, in assenting
to the Act," says Mr. Anthony Forster,** "was far greater than
that assumed by Colonel Gawler in drawing upon the Lords of the
Treasury, for it subverted the currency laws of the Empire, and
was clearly repugnant to Imperial statutes. To make it obligatory
upon the subjects of her Majesty to accept, as money, gold which
did not bear the Imperial effigy; and, worse still, to oblige
them to receive, as equal in value to the Queen's sterling
sovereigns, the promissory notes of any or of all the banks of
the colony, was such an interference with the circulating medium
as had seldom before been attempted."</p>
<p class="foot">[** "South Australia: its Progress and
Prosperity." London: 1866.]</p>
<p>The Government Assay Office was opened on the 10th of
February, and Mr. B.H. Babbage (son of Mr. Babbage, the
celebrated inventor of the calculating machine), and Dr. Davy
were appointed Government assayer and assistant assayer
respectively. Success set in at once. On the first day of opening
the office, gold to the value of upwards of &pound;10,000 was
deposited by twenty-nine persons, and day after day it continued
to pour in to an extent beyond the most sanguine expectations, so
that premises had to be enlarged almost at once, and the staff
increased.</p>
<p>No doubt the inducements held out to depositors of gold-dust
were great, the value given to the ingots and proportionately to
crude gold being far in excess of the ruling price in Melbourne,
where, at the time of passing the Bullion Act, it was from
58<i>s</i>. to 60<i>s</i>. per ounce, whereas the standard value
of assayed gold fixed by the Act in South Australia was
72<i>s</i>. This price, of course, became the great attraction to
owners and traders to bring their gold-dust or nuggets to South
Australia, while the high price there fixed&mdash;in comparison
with the Melbourne quotations&mdash;still left a sufficient
margin of profit to make the traffic in gold a profitable trade.
Almost everybody dabbled in it, and a walk through the streets of
Adelaide left the impression that the city was transformed into
El Dorado, shop windows being placarded all along the line of
streets, "Gold bought", "Cash for gold", "Advances on gold",
"Highest price given for gold", and so forth.</p>
<p>Shortly after the passing of the Bullion Act and the opening
of the Assay Office, large quantities of gold began to arrive by
vessels from Melbourne, one bringing &pound;11,000 worth, and
another &pound;25,000 worth. These importations were not so much
the property of the South Australian diggers as they were
profitable purchases on the part of merchants and traders. A plan
was, however, soon devised to reach these diggers direct by means
of an overland escort, and with praiseworthy promptitude the plan
was put into execution, Mr. Tolmer, commissioner of police, being
entrusted with the important undertaking. As this route was being
largely used by parties going to the diggings&mdash;the journey
with bullock drays sometimes occupying from six weeks to two
months&mdash;and as small farmers found it more profitable to
sell their wheat ground into flour at &pound;40 per ton on the
diggings rather than at &pound;12 10<i>s</i>. in Adelaide, the
road was put into order. During the month of February no less
than 1234 passengers, 1266 horses and bullocks, and 164 vehicles
of all descriptions had crossed the Murray by the Wellington
Ferry. The arrival of the first overland gold escort, a
spring-cart drawn by four horses and laden with over a quarter of
a ton of gold, was witnessed by multitudes of excited people. To
be exact, the first escort brought gold valued at &pound;18,456
9<i>s</i>., which had been sent by three hundred diggers. Mr.
Tolmer, who was some time afterwards made the recipient of a
handsome testimonial for his public services, reported having
accomplished the distance (338 miles) between Adelaide and Mount
Alexander in eight days. Arrangements were made for the escort to
run monthly so long as it continued to be of benefit to the South
Australian diggers, and a Commissioner was appointed to receive
and take charge of deposits of gold and direct postal
communication on the gold-fields.</p>
<p>The second overland gold escort arrived at Adelaide on the 4th
of May, with 1620 lbs. weight of gold, valued at &pound;70,000,
sent by 851 diggers, together with 1350 letters, and was welcomed
by some thousands of people, who proceeded to the eastern part of
the city to get the first glimpse of the cavalcade, which was
greeted with thundering cheers and the strains of music.*</p>

<p>Many stories of extraordinary adventure have been told of the
times of which we now write, but few are more interesting than
those in connection with the overland gold escort. One incident,
as a specimen of many, may be recorded here. During a season of
pitiless rain Mr. Tolmer made his arrangements to leave the
gold-fields with 28,000 ounces of the precious metal, consigned
to 1021 families. Through storm and tempest, and under the eyes
of a notorious gang who endeavoured to steal his horses and thus
cripple his means to resist an attack, he reached Forest Creek.
Then, when he was about to make his homeward start, in crossing
an alluvial flat the horses plunged a good deal on account of the
soft nature of the ground; but when the heavily laden cart came
quickly down the hill and reached the level ground, down it went
into a perfect bog. The wheels cut into the soil and sank until
they could go no deeper, the flat bottom of the cart resting on
the surface, and the horses plunging the while, but unable to
move their load. Many men had prophesied that the escort would
never reach Adelaide, and Mr. Tolmer was greeted with loud
laughter from some of the spectators and entreaties from others
not to proceed, while those who had bet champagne that he would
not accomplish his journey suggested that he should pay for the
champagne before he started. But the ex-commissioner of police
was a man of resource, and how he dealt with the difficulty may
best be told in his own words:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I took no heed of their sarcasm," he says, "but coolly, as if
on parade, gave the order 'Halt front! Dress! Prepare to
dismount! Dismount!' I then dismounted myself, unlocked the two
strong boxes fixed by bolts to the bottom of the cart in which
the gold was packed, quickly seized No. 1 bag, which I quietly
placed across my saddle, and then gave the word 'Left files, take
your bags!' In a moment, like as many ants, each trooper secured
his own particular bag, threw it across his saddle, and then
stood to his horse. Then followed the right files, who did the
same, and, lastly, the men who had the charge of led horses got
their bags and secured them on their respective packs. The whole
proceeding did not occupy ten minutes. Having remounted the men I
again gave the order 'Files right! March!'</p>
<p>"As we moved on, Rowe gave the horses a touch of the whip
which made them bound forward, causing the lightened vehicle to
spring up like a Jack-in-the-box, and then quickly continue its
way. I then doffed my cap, saying, 'Good-bye, gentlemen. I'll
come back and drink your champagne, be assured!' Whereupon they
cheered lustily. Some of them then mounted their horses and
accompanied us as far as the Lodden, where we parted. . . .</p>
<p>"After crossing the river, which was much swollen, the water
reaching above the saddle-flaps, I selected a spot and encamped
for the night in some thickly timbered country. It rained
incessantly all night, and while the storm howled through the
forest, it threatened to occasion serious impediments to our
progress. Early next morning we made a start, and on the road met
some teamsters who assured me that the Deep Creek, near Mr.
Bucknall's, was fordable, and that they had crossed with their
drays that morning. On arriving at the creek, however, I found it
greatly swollen, and to satisfy 'myself of its practicability I
went across in the first instance and then returned, and quickly
gave directions to the men to take possession of their respective
bags; then, taking the lead across the ford, I gave strict orders
to each trooper to follow closely my own horse, whilst Rowe was
to remain on the bank with the cart. During the time occupied in
the removal of each bag of gold from the cart, and making them
securely fast on the led horses, the water rose rapidly,
nevertheless a safe crossing was effected. The bags, of course,
got thoroughly soaked in the crossing, as we were up to our
waists in water, and had it not been for the dead weight each
horse carried, the whole cavalcade would have been swept away by
the torrent. As the last led horse reached the bank, I called out
to the driver, Rowe, not to lose a moment, but to drive the cart
(in which six bags of gold remained, also the mail, provisions,
etc.) and quickly cross the ford; which he attempted to do, but
the animal in the shafts was unable to arrest the impetus of the
vehicle, which rushed down the declivity and became fixed in a
flooded hollow at the bottom. Rowe then endeavoured to urge the
horses on, but the two leaders plunged into deeper water, and
were there held by the traces, whilst the force of the current
bore the shaft horse down and prevented him from rising. Seeing
this mischance, I threw aside my cloak and sword, and dashing
into the water, swam my horse across to the drowning animal, laid
hold of the reins, and assisted it to regain its footing and
reach a less dangerous part of the creek. Rowe was afraid to
venture further in the attempt to get it across the creek, and
urged fairly enough that, as he could not swim, the task was too
great. Mr. Bucknall, jun., who was amongst the persons attracted
to the spot, volunteered to take Rowe's place, which offer I
gratefully accepted; and, having removed the bags of gold by
dropping them into the water, and saved the mail, I mounted one
of the leading horses and headed him to the ford. The water had,
however, still risen while the cart was being unloaded, and it
was necessary to swim the horses over. In attempting to do so I
had a very narrow escape of being drowned, for when the current
was strongest the horse on which I was mounted lost its
equipoise, turned over, and plunged out into the turbid torrent,
that had now formed itself into a river of considerable
magnitude. I had very great difficulty in extricating myself from
the dangerous position I was placed in by this untoward event;
and, to add to my embarrassment, the top of one of my large
riding-boots was turned down by the action of the water, and my
spurs became entangled in the straps. My presence of mind did
not, however, forsake me at this juncture, and, having freed my
limbs by adjusting my dress I struck out and was about to make
for the bank, when I perceived the current was carrying the
horses and cart down the course of the stream. Although greatly
exhausted, I made another effort, and succeeded in laying hold of
the reins to turn the horses towards a landing-place, and cut the
traces of the two leaders, which, upon being freed, were swept
down the stream and managed to scramble ashore on the opposite
bank. The cart, in which were the provisions of the party, and
other matters, and the shaft horse were then carried away and
lost. There were from thirty to forty persons witnessing these
exhausting efforts, and, with the exception of Mr. Bucknall, no
one volunteered to assist me. One man indeed, acting under a
generous impulse, threw off his coat, but the bystanders
dissuaded him from 'risking his life to save a horse.'</p>
<p>"After recovering myself somewhat by sitting on the bank and
resting my back against a gum tree, I set about to recover the
six bags of gold, which were then in a deep part of the creek and
about six or eight yards from the bank, which I succeeded in
doing by diving, each time seizing a bag, with which I reached
the bank by taking a few long strides. The next momentous task,
attended with difficulty and risk of life, was swimming my horse
backwards and forwards across the swollen torrent with the gold,
which I likewise successfully accomplished; but on returning
again for the fourteenth time, bringing over the mail, on account
of the exhausted condition of both the horse and myself, we were
swiftly carried down the stream, and, had it not been for Mr.
Bucknall and one or two others, we must have been drowned; for
about a quarter of a mile below the ford, there was a rickety
wooden bridge, submerged at both ends, with a space of about six
inches between the under part of the arch and level of the water,
against which the horse and myself were jammed. One moment
longer, without the help before mentioned, we must both have been
forced under the bridge by the strength of the current, and of
course lost our lives.</p>
<p>"The horse which performed this almost incredible feat was a
splendid animal, very powerful, and stood about sixteen hands
high; as a fencer there was not his equal in the colony."</p>
<p>Referring to this incident a few years later in a petition to
the House of Assembly, Mr. Tolmer gave a summary of the events,
thus: "Your petitioner suggested and brought into active
operation the gold escort, and was for several months engaged in
travelling therewith, on one occasion swimming his horse nineteen
times across the overflowed Deep Creek in Victoria, recovering
nine bags, containing &pound;30,000 worth of gold, which were in
imminent danger of being swept away by the torrent, in
consequence of one of the horses harnessed to the cart containing
the gold being drowned and the cart itself lost; for which
last-mentioned services the Legislature addressed his Excellency
Sir H.E.F. Young, then Governor of this province, requesting him
to award your petitioner as a gratuity &pound;100; which gratuity
your petitioner unfortunately never received, inasmuch as his
Excellency did not accede to the prayer of the said address."

<p class="foot">[** There appears to be some discrepancy here,
but we quote verbatim from "Reminiscences of an Adventurous and
Chequered Career", by Alexander Tolmer, vol. ii. p. 245.]</p>
<p>The Bullion Act not only saved the mercantile community from
impending ruin, and the colony from general disaster, but it
secured the speedy return of the colonists who had left at a time
when the absence of such an inducement might have led to their
permanent removal. As early as the month of March, unsuccessful
gold-diggers returned in hundreds, and the vacant offices in the
various departments of the public service began to be filled up.
In the months of April and May the arrivals exceeded the
departures, and in June eleven vessels arrived in Adelaide,
bringing 687 passengers from Victoria.</p>
<p>As the season drew near for ploughing and sowing many of the
successful as well as the unsuccessful diggers returned to put in
their crops, and things in general began to assume their ordinary
aspect, with the addition of an abundance of wealth, and of a far
more than ordinary amount of business. The first to benefit
extensively by the reaction were the drapers and clothiers. The
wives of fortunate diggers seemed determined to welcome their
husbands in a way commensurate with their suddenly acquired
wealth, and many ludicrous instances of absurd and unbecoming:
extravagance in dress occurred.</p>
<p>When the land sales were resumed a large number wisely
invested their savings in land and house property. A great
impetus was also given to the wheat and flour trade, large
quantities of which were exported every week to Melbourne, and in
consequence the price went up in Adelaide from &pound;12 per ton
to &pound;37, while other provisions rose proportionately as the
rate of wages increased.</p>
<p>Owing to the increased cost of living, which for some time
past had exceeded on the average one hundred and fifty per cent.
on the cost of corresponding items when official salaries were
fixed, an increase of salary to all Government officers claimed
the attention of the Legislature in 1853, persons in the public
service being the only class either deriving no advantage, or
suffering loss from circumstances which had been so favourable to
the condition of the large majority of the colonists. Moreover,
official duties had become permanently more extended and more
onerous by reason of the enlarged political and social station to
which the colony had attained.</p>
<p>In August (1852) the dwellers in South Australia were again
thrown into a state of great excitement by the reported discovery
of a gold-field of their own at Echunga, about eighteen to twenty
miles from Adelaide. A commissioner was appointed, Government
officials and mounted police were despatched to the scene of
action, huts were erected, the <i>Register</i> and
<i>Observer</i> sent special reporters, all requisite machinery
was soon in working order, and in a few weeks a thousand licences
were issued. It was thought that a second Ballarat or Mount
Alexander had been discovered, but soon the excitement quieted
down, and though many continued at the diggings, earning a fair,
and in some instances a very good, rate of wages, the existing
state of things in the colony was not seriously disarranged,
although the state of the labour market was such that many public
works sanctioned by the Legislature could not be commenced.</p>
<p>When the Council met again in September (1852) the Governor
announced the extinction of the bond debt of &pound;85,800, which
had been hanging as a millstone round the neck of the Exchequer
Department, and referring to the operation of the Bullion Act, he
said&mdash;</p>
<p>"This Act, by which the requisite increase of the currency of
the bank-notes was regulated on a basis of present convertibility
into assayed and stamped bullion, and of eventual convertibility,
at no distant date, into coin of the realm, has, up to the
present time, in its practical results, almost compensated for
the absence of a Mint, has surpassed the expectations of the most
sanguine, and has completely vindicated the prudence and sagacity
of the Legislature of South Australia."</p>
<p>The Bullion Act was assented to by the Queen, and her
Majesty's Government communicated to the Lieutenant-Governor
"their disposition not to interfere with the discretion of the
local authorities, who have exercised so much ability in their
mode of dealing with this subject."</p>
<p>Early in 1853 a handsome testimonial was presented to Mr. G.
Tinline, manager of the South Australian Banking Company, for the
important part he had taken in furthering the objects of the
Bullion Act.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that no sooner had the mass of diggers
returned to resume their various avocations, and had gathered in
the harvest of 1852-53, than another exodus was threatened by
reports of extensive and astounding gold discoveries in Victoria.
The nuggets found were said to weigh respectively 76 lbs., 85
lbs., 120 lbs., and 134 lbs. Hundreds sped away at once, but the
more sober-minded were deterred by the fact that very few out of
the many thousands at the diggings were successful.</p>
<p>The overland escort continued to run throughout the year
(1853), but was discontinued in December, the gold diggings
having spread over a much larger extent of country, rendering it
more difficult to collect the gold, and in consequence greatly
increasing the cost of the escort. Arrangements were then made
with the Victoria Government for the transmission of gold by the
vessels running between Adelaide and Melbourne; but, gold having
risen considerably in value in Victoria, there was not the same
inducement to send it to Adelaide.</p>
<p>Great service was rendered to the colony throughout the whole
period of the gold rush by the <i>Register</i> and
<i>Observer</i> newspapers. When the North Eastern mails were
stopped, this establishment undertook the transmission of a
weekly mail to Houghton, Gumeracha, Chain of Ponds, and other
places. A "Diggers' Edition" of the <i>Observer</i> was also
regularly forwarded to the gold-fields, by which communication
was kept up between the South Australian diggers and their
friends at home, numbers of personal messages being sent through
its columns, and, having a special correspondent at the diggings,
authentic information was conveyed from time to time of the
success or otherwise of the South Australian diggers.</p>
<br>
<p>Another important series of events, with which the name of Sir
Henry Young will always be intimately associated, was in
connection with the navigation and opening up of the river
Murray.</p>
<p>In 1849 a committee was appointed to inquire into the
practicability and cost of establishing places of shipment at the
heads of St. Vincent's and Spencer's Gulf, and at the
Onkaparinga, and of opening up a communication from the river
Murray to Encounter Bay, to report on the capabilities of these
localities and of their requirements to make them available as
shipping places for colonial traffic.</p>
<p>Also (it was an age of progress, and it was carrying out the
ideas propounded in the first speech of the Governor), they were
to report on the shoals, reefs, sunken rocks, soundings, extent
of anchorage, winds and range of exposure, height of waves,
currents, and all kindred matters touching the safety of
shipping.</p>
<p>In opening the session of 1850, on the 23rd of May, the
Governor called attention to the difficulty of a direct
communication from the sea mouth of the river Murray&mdash;a
difficulty which had hitherto baffled and disappointed the hopes
and enterprise of the friends of South Australia, both European
and colonial, and still remained insuperable. But, aided by the
good services of Captain Lipson, R.N., and Mr. Richard T. Hill,
C.E., he was satisfied that the long-coveted desideratum was
practicable by the construction of a railway entirely over Crown
lands, along the sea-board of Encounter Bay, connecting the
Murray at Goolwa with Port Elliot. He argued that if his project
were carried out it would not only immediately and directly
benefit the province, but eventually would be of great value to
the whole of Australia. There was not a ready response to this
scheme, an undertaking nearer home&mdash;that is to say, the City
and Port Railway&mdash;being considered of more importance.
Nevertheless the larger scheme was destined to be the first to be
carried on and completed.</p>
<p>On the 6th of June, 1850, Captain Bagot moved that a sum of
&pound;4000 should be placed upon the estimates of 1851 for the
purpose of granting a bonus of &pound;2000 each for the first and
second iron steamers of not less than forty horse-power, and not
exceeding in draught two feet of water when loaded, that should
successfully navigate the waters of the river Murray from the
Goolwa to, at least, the junction of the Darling. In August the
bonus of &pound;4000 was duly advertised.</p>
<p>On the 10th of September Sir Henry and Lady Young, accompanied
by Mr. (afterwards Sir Arthur) Freeling and Mrs. Freeling, Mr.
and Mrs. Torrens, and Mr. W.S.M. Hutton, started from Adelaide
for the purpose of proceeding some distance up the Murray, to
ascertain from personal observation, by taking soundings in
various parts, the practicability of navigating the river. The
gentlemen proceeded on horseback, and the ladies were conveyed in
a carriage to the Rufus, two whale-boats having been sent up from
Wellington for the use of the party. They started on the 25th
from the Rufus, and reached the Darling on the 29th, thus
satisfying themselves that, so far, the river could be
successfully navigated. On the return trip they proceeded by
water to the Goolwa, with two other boats in company. In crossing
Lake Alexandrina they experienced a little rough weather. On
arrival at Port Elliot the Yatala was in waiting to convey the
party to Port Adelaide, where they arrived after an absence of
about two months.</p>
<p>Soon after this, a marvellous exploit was performed by Captain
Francis Cadell, who had arrived in Australia a few years before,
and was as enthusiastic about the navigation of the Murray as Sir
Henry Young was himself. Leaving Melbourne with a canvas boat
carried on the back of a pack-horse, he arrived at length at Swan
Hill Station on the Upper Murray, launched his frail craft, and,
with four diggers he had chanced to meet, descended the stream to
Lake Victoria, a distance of thirteen hundred miles. On his
arrival in Adelaide, he announced the important result of his
observations, namely, that the river could be safely navigated by
steamers of shallow draught. The matter was taken up with great
enthusiasm: the Murray Steam Navigation Company was formed,
principally through the efforts of Captain Cadell and Mr. William
Younghusband, for some time Chief Secretary of the Colony; and a
steamer, the <i>Lady Augusta</i>, so named after the wife of the
Governor, was soon placed by the company upon the river.</p>
<p>On the first voyage (in 1853) she was commanded by Captain
Cadell, who was accompanied by Sir Henry and Lady Young, a
special party of ladies and gentlemen, and two representatives of
the press. At Swan Hill, thirteen hundred miles from the sea, the
Governor addressed a despatch to the Duke of Newcastle, Secretary
of State for the Colonies, acquainting him with the success of
steam navigation on the Murray. The following is an extract from
the despatch:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have the honour and gratification of acquainting your Grace
that the project of the steam navigation of the river Murray, the
promotion of which has never ceased to engage my attention since
my arrival in South Australia, has thus far been prosecuted with
perfect success. The distance from the river Murray terminus near
the sea at the Goolwa, in South Australia, to as far up as this
place, is now ascertained to be an easily navigable course of
thirteen hundred miles. The wool, with which this vessel is now
about to be laden, is only the commencement of a large future
carrying trade, beneficial to the greater part of the extensive
continent of Australia. Under these circumstances I beg leave to
make known to your Grace the conclusions at which I have arrived
after personal observation in regard to the further measures it
would be politic to adopt in order to promote the colonization of
the vast basin of the Murray. . . . As respects measures actually
progressing towards completion, I have briefly to state that the
connection of the river Murray terminus, styled the Goolwa (a
designation applied to it by the aborigines at Encounter Bay)
with the sea at Port Elliot will immediately be effected by an
animal-power iron tramway of only seven miles in length. The
tramway connects the river at the Goolwa with Port Elliot, and is
laid on jetties at both places. At Port Elliot there are means of
supplying fresh water to the shipping, and the anchorage is
furnished with moorings for large ships. These improvements will
have cost the Government &pound;23,000, in addition to
&pound;6500, which will probably become payable from the same
source, as premiums for the introduction of river steamers. . .
."</p>
<p>After describing the extensive tracts of land on the banks of
the river, the Governor continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Considering, therefore, the importance of facilitating the
location on its banks of persons whose industrial pursuits would
be promoted in connection with the carrying trade of wool, and
the return supplies to the stockowners; considering, too, most
especially, the probability that large numbers of British
emigrants, whether intending in future to settle in Victoria, New
South Wales, or South Australia, are likely to be attracted to
the vast basin of the Murray when its navigability by steamers
shall become known, and it is found to be a most convenient route
to the gold-fields&mdash;I have come to the determination at once
to submit to my Executive Council, on my return to Adelaide, the
expediency of proclaiming the lands on both banks of the river
within the bounds of South Australia to the extent of two miles,
to be the 'Hundreds of the Murray in South Australia.' Surveys of
villages will be made in select spots, as traffic and population
require, and roads leading to and from the river will be reserved
for public use and as a means of access to the back lands, whilst
the alluvial flats, subject, at present, to periodical
inundation, may, by embankment, be rendered perfectly available.
. . ."</p>
<p>The return journey was successfully accomplished, and the
arrival of the explorers in Adelaide was the occasion of great
popular festivities. The promised Government bonus was presented
to Captain Cadell; the Legislature directed a gold medal to be
struck to commemorate the event; several other steamers were soon
placed upon the river, not only by the Murray River Navigation
Company, but also by enterprising colonists; popular opinion, at
one time dead against the expenditure of so much money on the
scheme, turned in its favour, and the Legislature which had
stoutly opposed it, gave a grand banquet in the Council Chamber
to celebrate "the unparalleled triumph".</p>
<p>However much the community generally approved, the squatters,
who wished to remain the sole and undisturbed occupiers of the
vast tracts of pastoral country adjacent to the Murray river,
were by no means pleased. The Murray Hundreds, when declared,
became for years a subject for the discussion and animadversion
of those who considered that their rights and territory had been
unnecessarily invaded and encroached upon, by reserving the whole
of the water frontages for hundreds of miles on both side of the
river, while the back country was destitute of water.</p>
<p>No one rejoiced more sincerely in the successful opening up of
the Murray than Sir Henry Young. It had been his pet scheme from
the commencement of his administration. He foresaw the
development of a great water-way for the commerce of the
adjoining colonies; he foresaw the valley of the Murray teeming
with a wealthy industrial population; he prophesied that Port
Elliot would soon be "the New Orleans of the Australian
Mississippi".</p>
<p>It is painful to record that the dreams of the Governor never
came true, and the sequel to the story we have briefly told here
is a melancholy and disappointing one. Port Elliot was an utter
failure, owing to its insecurity and want of accommodation. Over
&pound;20,000, in addition to the initial cost, was "thrown into
the sea", in a vain attempt to construct a breakwater and so
improve the port, which resulted in its silting up, and at length
it was abandoned. An enormous sum was also spent upon Port
Victor, seven miles away, which then became the port of the
Murray. Almost every one who speculated in the Murray trade came
to grief, some to utter ruin, and amongst them the gallant
Captain Cadell; the Murray Steam Navigation Company was
dissolved, and the whole scheme was threatened with total
collapse. In process of time, however, as we shall see later on
in this history, the Murray river trade got into other hands and
met with varying success, but the sanguine hopes of Sir Henry
Young have never yet been fully realized.</p>
<p>One subject on which there was considerable discussion in
1852, and great diversity of opinion, was the abolition of grand
juries. Under the rule of Sir George Grey the first attempt was
made to abolish them. It was then enacted in the colony "that in
order to dispense with the attendance of the grand jury, and
otherwise to expedite the business of sessions of the peace, all
criminal proceedings before any such court of general sessions
shall be by information in the name of her Majesty's
Advocate-General." The ordinance was disallowed by Lord Stanley,
"but the local authorities," says Mr. Rusden in his "History of
Australia", "persevered. In 1843 they pushed aside, without
abolishing, grand juries by an Ordinance . . . which ordered that
'no person should be put upon trial . . . unless the bill shall
first have been presented to a grand jury on the prosecution of
her Majesty's Attorney or Advocate-General and shall have been
returned by them a true bill, reserving always, nevertheless, to
her Majesty's Attorney or Advocate-General the right of tiling
informations <i>ex officio</i>, and to the Supreme Court the
right of permitting informations to be filed.' This Ordinance was
allowed; and, the path being smoothed, the work of repudiating a
great social duty was consummated in 1852 by another (when Sir
Henry F. Young was Governor and Mr. E.D. Hanson the principal law
officer), which declared that 'from and after the passing of this
Act no person shall be summoned or liable to serve on any grand
jury,' repealed the section of the Ordinance of 1843 above cited,
and made presentment 'in the name and by the authority of a
prosecuting officer sufficient when the lives of her Majesty's
subjects were imperilled. The motive of departmental convenience
was thus allowed to prevail, although some colonists were of
opinion that the grand jury system had worked well."</p>
<p>In 1853 there were matters pending in the Legislative Council
which were to influence the whole of the future of the colony,
and to impress the name of the Governor indelibly upon its
annals.</p>
<p>As the time drew near for the sitting of the Legislative
Council, every man in the colony was more or less on his mettle.
The great question of a new Constitution, which it was hoped
would secure responsible government and free political
institutions from that time forth and for evermore, was to be
discussed, and meetings were held in various parts of the colony
to have a "first say" in moulding opinion.</p>
<p>When the Legislative Council met on the 21st of July,
despatches were read intimating the royal pleasure, upon certain
conditions, to grant to the Legislature of the province the
complete control of its internal affairs and the entire
management and revenue of the Waste Lands of the Crown.</p>
<p>Two Bills were therefore introduced, one for constituting a
Parliament consisting of a Legislative Council and Assembly, and
the other for granting a Civil List to her Majesty.</p>
<p>"In framing the Bill for constituting a Parliament," said the
Governor in his opening address to the Council, "a principal
object has been to continue the advantages of a popular
Government with those which result from the existence of an
independent body, identified with the permanent interests of the
colony, and forming a security against hasty or partial
legislation. With this view, the number of members of the House
of Assembly is proposed to be increased, the elective franchise
to be extended, the duration of the Assembly to be reduced from
five to three years, and a more simple and, it is believed,
efficacious plan of registration has been devised. It has been
provided that the Assembly thus constituted shall have the same
control over the revenue and expenditure which is possessed by
the Commons House of Parliament in England, while the Legislative
Council will consist of persons summoned by the Crown, who will
hold their seats for life, and thus be independent both of the
Government and of the people. Her Majesty's Government, after
full consideration, has deemed it most accordant with the
principles of the British constitution that the selection of
members for the Upper Chamber should be vested in the Crown.
Experience has shown that, where the principle of responsible
government exists, no permanent opposition can be maintained
against the deliberate and repeated will of the community as
expressed through their representatives; and if these reasonable
expectations should be disappointed, a power is reserved to the
united Legislature of introducing such further amendments in the
Constitution as may suffice to bring it into harmony with the
circumstances and wants of the colony."</p>
<p>The idea of a nominee Upper House was distasteful to the
majority of the colonists, and the newspapers had but recently
informed them how it had been ridiculed in the British
Parliament. In a debate upon the Australian Colonies Bill, the
Duke of Newcastle had said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The theory of a nominee Upper House arose from the old notion
of Imperial government, and from an idea that it was necessary to
bind the colonies and the mother country together by some means
other than those of mutual interest; that while it may be
desirable to give the colonists a representative body to attend
to their interests, they must at the same time appoint a
nominated body to attend to the interests of the mother country.
Now, it appeared to him that in following this old-fashioned
notion, the Government were in this instance and in others, since
their accession to power, pursuing the shadow instead of the
substance of a conservative principle."</p>
<p>He continued: "Let them in any way provide for the superior
influence of the members of an elective Upper Chamber; let them
insist upon a higher qualification, either of elected or
electors; let them give them a longer tenure of their seats, or
make the areas of representation more extensive; but let them not
engraft upon this measure of freedom and contentment to the
colony a scheme which must end in disappointment and be the cause
of future quarrel."</p>
<p>Earl Grey, in alluding to the want of analogy between a
nominee Upper Chamber and the House of Lords, remarked "on the
perfect absurdity of talking of a nominee Legislative Council as
an imitation of that House. It had not," he said, "the most
distant or faint resemblance to the House of Lords, which was an
institution altogether peculiar to this country, and which
Parliament could no more create than they could create a
full-grown oak. It had grown up as part of our institutions from
the earliest times, and was like no other body in any country in
the world, and no imitation of which had ever been in the
slightest degree successful."</p>
<p>Not only was the idea of a nominee Upper House distasteful to
the outside public in the colony, but it was also to the elective
members of the Legislature, who, at a meeting held to discuss the
situation, agreed to oppose it. The next important step was taken
by Mr. J.H. Fisher, who moved for a call of the House on the
second reading of the Bill. Before the second reading came on,
Mr. Dutton brought forward the following motion:&mdash;"That in
the proposed Bill for constituting a Parliament for South
Australia, this Council is of opinion that the Upper House should
be elective."</p>
<p>The debate on this motion lasted for three days, and on a
division was lost by a majority of eight, in consequence of
several members, who admitted the principle, having entered into
a compromise with the Government to the effect that "a nominated
Upper Chamber should be accepted by the House, on condition that
the Constitution should be amended after a period of nine years,
should such be deemed expedient by two-thirds of the members of
the Lower House, and whose wishes to that effect should be
expressed in two consecutive sessions, with a dissolution of the
Assembly between."</p>
<p>The second and third readings of the Bill were carried, each
by a majority of five. During the progress of the Bill through
its different stages, the House divided no fewer than eleven
times.</p>
<p>Considerable discussion also attended the passing of the Civil
List Bill, which went through the ordeal of a select committee.
The sums suggested by it, however, were not adopted, much larger
amounts being substituted by the Council.</p>
<p>The debate on the Parliament Bill of 1853 was, perhaps, the
very best in the history of the South Australian Legislature.
Every man was in earnest, and seemed imbued with the idea that in
the part he was taking he was assisting to make the whole future
of the colony. Many of the speeches might rank among the finest
specimens of oratory of the English-speaking peoples. Although,
as we shall see later on, their Bill was defeated, not receiving
the royal assent, the victory was morally complete. Its
provisions laid down the principles, and created and shaped the
public opinion which in three years' time was to carry everything
before it with overwhelming force; and to the Legislative Council
of 1853 every colonist in South Australia, now and for all time,
owes a debt of deep gratitude, as they were undoubtedly the
fathers and founders of the most free political institutions
compatible with the sovereignty of the mother country.</p>
<p>Another important event that marked the successful
administration of Sir Henry Young was the establishment of
District Councils. In every new colony the question of roads and
road-making is a burning one, and dwellers in old-established
cities can form no conception of the wild enthusiasm, the fiery
oratory, the impassioned earnestness displayed over a discussion
on road-making. It had been a leading topic for many years in
South Australia, during which time the central Government had
undertaken the formation and repair of the main lines of road out
of the land revenue. But as the country became opened up in all
directions, it was found that the expense of making and
maintaining roads in the various districts could not be borne
from the same fund. On the 25th of November, 1852, therefore, "An
Act to appoint District Councils, and to define the power
thereof," passed the Legislative Council, and gave to the various
districts power to tax themselves for the making and management
(if their own particular roads, bridges, and public buildings; to
grant timber, publicans', depasturing, and slaughtering licences,
to establish pounds for the impounding of stray cattle, and so
forth. Long before Adelaide had a Corporation, municipal
arrangements and a measure of local self-government were extended
to the country districts.</p>
<p>"District Councils," says Mr. Finniss, "as they are
established in this colony, are but incipient stages of a more
perfect organization, which time and enlarged population will
produce. They certainly, by their adoption, relieved the central
Government of much odium, responsibility, and administrative
work. It would have been impossible to manage the expenditure
required under the head of roads, streets, and bridges, to which
the Crown moiety, as it was called, of the land sales fund was
applicable, without local advice and assistance, so as to avoid
the reality, or at least the imputation, of favouritism and
corruption. Local taxation, which was included in the powers
given to the local bodies, and was eventually to supply the place
of the subsidies from the general revenues, could not have been
resorted to without the intervention of local elective bodies and
absolute local self-control. It would have been invidious, if not
absolutely unconstitutional, to have taxed a particular district
for the erection of a bridge, or any other requisite public
buildings, whereas there could be no objection to leave it in the
power of a properly constituted district authority to tax
themselves for such purpose where the benefit would be chiefly
local."</p>
<p>Closely allied to the question of roads is that of railways,
and to Sir Henry Young has been given the complimentary title of
"Father of the Railway System of South Australia". So early as
February, 1850, a measure was proposed by him, and carried
through the Legislative Council, entitled, "An Ordinance for
making a Railway from the City to the Port of Adelaide, with
Branches to the North Arm; "and, a month later, a private
ordinance guaranteed to the Adelaide City and Port Railway
Company certain divisible profits in the concern. But the times
were not ripe for the scheme to be floated, and there was much
squabbling among wharf proprietors and others with local
interests to protect, so that neither of these ordinances was put
into operation. In the enlarged and partly elective Legislative
Council of 1851, afresh scheme was submitted and carried, namely,
"An Act to authorize the Appointment of Undertakers for the
Construction of the City and Port Railway," and from time to time
funds were voted and placed in the hands of the executive body
appointed under this Act.</p>
<p>On the 16th of December, 1854, almost the last act of the
Governor before leaving the colony was to give his assent to a
Bill authorizing the formation of the Adelaide and Gawler Town
Railway, and to provide for raising the money required for that
purpose.</p>
<p>Although, while Sir Henry Young was in the colony, there was
not a mile of railroad opened to the public, the great battle of
Locomotive <i>v</i>. Tramway was fought out by him; the sum of
&pound;400,000 was authorized under his administration for
railway purposes, together with a further sum of &pound;100,000
for deepening and improving the harbour, and so increasing the
prospects of prosperity for the Port Railway. These sums
initiated the national debt of South Australia.</p>
<p>The question of the defence of South Australia had happily not
been necessary to discuss until the year 1854, when the startling
news reached the colony that England, in alliance with France,
had declared war against Russia. Hitherto no sense of danger had
been felt; the sergeant's guard of Royal Marines (the bodyguard
of Captain Hindmarsh, the first Governor) had given place to
small detachments of troops&mdash;generally a couple of companies
under one field officer&mdash;furnished by the regiments
stationed in the older colonies. Spasmodic efforts were made, in
the time of Governor Gawler and subsequently, to establish a
volunteer force, but without much effect, and in the year 1846
there was supposed to be in existence "the Royal South Australian
Militia Force". But this, according to a facetious member of the
Legislative Council, "consisted of officers only and no troops."
It was added that the standing army of South Australia had been
for some years a standing joke, and that on one occasion, when
the force was called out for exercise, the drill-sergeant, with
great dignity and authority, gave the word of command to the
three privates who occupied the field, "to form a square!"</p>
<p>But in 1854, when the population of the colony had risen to
nearly 100,000, and when the peace of Europe had been suddenly
and rudely disturbed, it was considered time to take some serious
action in case of surprise by an enemy's privateer or man-of-war.
Accordingly, a Board was appointed to inquire into and report
upon the measures of defence requisite for the public safety in
case of&mdash;nobody knew exactly what. Of course the committee
recommended as much protection as would have been practicable if
Russia had declared war against South Australia, but out of it
came some tangible results. An armed body of volunteers was
enrolled; &pound;15,000 was voted for defensive preparations; a
Militia Bill was passed; excitement ran as high as fever heat,
and the Colonial Secretary (Mr. B.T. Finniss), who was appointed
"lieutenant-colonel of the staff and inspecting field officer,"
was able to report thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Leading colonists joined the military movement; men who
afterwards became members of Parliament and of Ministries, men of
substance, proprietors of the principal trading establishments in
the city, served as privates in the first muster of a South
Australian armed force, and of their zeal, enthusiasm, and
martial ardour there could be no doubt in the minds of those who
witnessed the first passage of arms and who saw the suburban
companies cheerfully submitting to the rule of
drill-masters."</p>
<p>Happily, in this first passage of arms, the (sham) enemy was
only butchered to make a South Australian holiday; the Militia
Act remained in abeyance; the volunteers, with their good old
Brown Besses, had some fine exercise, and were paid for each
day's attendance; and the seventeen thousand odd pounds spent was
a good investment, inasmuch as it was the means of giving peace
of mind to every timid colonist. Eventually, as we shall see in
the course of this history, an efficient military establishment
was formed, but not until many years had elapsed.</p>
<p>On the 20th of December, 1854, the successful administration
of Sir Henry Young came to an end, and he left the colony on that
day to assume the Government of Tasmania, bearing with him the
gratitude and the good wishes of the whole population of South
Australia.</p>
<p>Pending the arrival of the new Governor, Mr. Boyle Travers
Finniss, one of the earliest settlers, who came to the colony
with the surveying party in the <i>Cygnet</i>, was appointed
acting Governor. He had from the first held many important
offices, and commanded the respect of all parties in the colony.
There were no events of any importance to mark the term of his
office, but the quiet, business-like, and unostentatious manner
in which he conducted the routine of public affairs won for him
universal approval.</p>

<p>A<small>FTER</small> a stormy and perilous voyage of unusual
length, the steamship <i>Burra-Burra</i>, with Sir Richard and
Lady MacDonnell on board, arrived at Port Adelaide on the 7th of
June, 1855.</p>
<p>Next morning the vessels in the harbour and the public
buildings on shore displayed their bunting, and, under a salute
of seventeen guns, the new Governor landed and was driven, with
Lady MacDonnell, in a carriage and four to Adelaide, amid the
enthusiastic cheers of some thousands of the populace who lined
the streets.</p>
<p>Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell, a son of the Rev. Dr.
MacDonnell, Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, was born in 1815,
entered Trinity College in 1830, took his degree of M.A. in 1839,
and Doctor of Laws by special honorary degree in 1844. He was
called to the English Bar in 1841, but two years later he
accepted the office, then created, of Chief Justice of the
British possessions at the Gambia, where he performed useful work
in consolidating the laws of that colony, and also found time to
make extensive and adventurous travels into the interior of
Africa. Afterwards he twice visited North America, when he
travelled over Canada and a great portion of the United States.
He returned to England in 1847, and tendered the resignation of
his office with a view to settling down at the English Bar. But
Earl Grey having offered him the governorship of the Gambia
Settlements, he returned there, and ably filled the difficult
office for three years. When visiting one of the native kings he
fell into an ambush treacherously laid for him, and was within an
ace of being assassinated. Such an outrage on the representative
of England could not be allowed to go unpunished, and four
hundred men under Major Hill, including Sir Richard, acting as
captain of a volunteer company, marched into the country of the
enemy, and inflicted summary chastisement. Several explorations
by the Governor into the interior of the country resulted in
extending the limits of British commerce. In 1852 he was gazetted
to the Government of St. Lucia in the West Indies, and afterwards
to St. Vincent. He was knighted by the Queen in February, 1855,
and soon afterwards&mdash;the appointment of the Hon. Mr. Lawley
to the Government of South Australia having been
cancelled&mdash;Sir Richard set sail from England to succeed Sir
Henry Young in the Governorship of that province.</p>
<p>One of the first subjects to engage the attention of the new
Governor was the large number of unemployed Irish female
immigrants in the colony. Some hundreds were in the dep&ocirc;ts,
and it was not known how many more were on their way out. By this
large, and in some respects unsuitable supply, the Emigration
Commissioners posed as benefactors to the colonists, but the boon
threatened to become a bane of no small magnitude. This kind of
labour was only suitable for the country, and even there it was a
drug in the market. But circulars were sent to the stipendiary
and resident magistrates and chairmen of district councils with a
view of ascertaining how many immigrants would be likely to meet
with engagements in each district, and the result was more
successful than had been anticipated&mdash;until an unlooked-for
contingency arose. Many of these Irishwomen preferred a town life
to a country life, and returned to the Adelaide dep&ocirc;t on
the slightest pretext, or without any pretext at all.</p>
<p>Many schemes were proposed to meet the difficulty; among them
one by Mr. E. Stephens, who suggested that respectable settlers
should be found to employ them in any fair and suitable work for
six months, the employer to provide them with board and lodging,
and five shillings per week to be paid from the colonial
treasury. But this suggestion was not carried out.</p>
<p>A remedy for excessive immigration was most urgently needed.
During the first eight months of the year (1855), 2800 adult
single females were landed at Adelaide, of whom 2047 were Irish,
or nearly treble the total number of English and Scotch females.
It was feared that the seeds of permanent pauperism were being
sown. Despite every effort made by the Government and by the
magistrates and district councils throughout the colony to obtain
employment for them, there were, on the day the Legislative
Council met, 800 Irish female immigrants lodged and rationed,
either in the rural dep&ocirc;ts or in town, as against only 27
English and 18 Scotch. At other times there had been as many as
1100.</p>
<p>Additional accommodation had to be provided, and the expense
of this, with maintenance, reached nearly &pound;25,000 in one
year, "an amount", said the Governor, "which I propose to charge
against the immigration moiety of the land fund, on the ground
that all expenses and rations of an immigrant from the time he
leaves England, till his absorption in the general population,
are as justly chargeable against this fund as the cost of his
rations on board the vessel which conveys him to these shores."
Special representations were made to the Home Government, urging
the necessity of a total discontinuance, for a considerable time,
of Irish female immigration.</p>
<p>There was no ill feeling on the question of nationality,
although it was determined in some quarters not to give any
encouragement to immigrants from Ireland, which was not equally
extended to natives of England, Wales, and Scotland. There was
ample room for all who could work as agricultural labourers,
miners, mechanics, or in any kind of industry, and it was a
simple matter of fact that, although 9111 immigrants were landed
in the first three quarters of the year, scarcely any of them
remained unemployed except the women from Ireland.</p>
<p>It was some years before the matter was settled. The Colonial
Commissioners in England paid very little regard in those days to
remonstrances from the colony, and as the land fund had been
prolific, the Commissioners continued to pour thousands of Irish
immigrants into the colony. A select committee, appointed to
report on excessive female immigration, stated that the total
excess of females over males in 1853 was 679; in 1854, 1604; in
1855, 2829. Of the adult single females who arrived in 1855, 851
were English, 217 were Scotch, and 2981 were Irish!</p>
<p>It was a curious fact that at this time, although there were
many hundreds of women out of employment, the greatest difficulty
was experienced in obtaining a really good domestic servant.</p>
<p>Eventually a check was put upon the undue supply of Irish
female labour, and an agent, with a salary of &pound;500 a year,
was appointed by the colonial Legislature to assist the
Commissioners in the selection of suitable emigrants.</p>
<p>An amusing incident in connection with this subject was
narrated by Sir Richard MacDonnell some years later in a speech
delivered by him at the Royal Colonial Institute. Referring to
the fact that in one year the Emigration Commissioners in England
sent out 12,000 emigrants, he said "his hearers might fancy how
much the difficulty of the position was augmented when he told
them that of the above number no fewer than 4004 were
able-bodied, single ladies. He questioned whether any other man
than he ever had previously such a number of single women thrust
upon him. He confessed that he had never been so embarrassed. He
did what he could for them; built them barracks, offered to pay
their fare, and all expenses to any employers willing to take
them off his hands, for he was sorry to have to add that they
were occasionally very unruly. Now, as women in a state of
rebellion are not so easily dealt with as men, he might mention
that by a happy thought they were on one occasion reduced to
obedience by the cooling effects of water from a fire engine."
*</p>
<p class="foot">[* "Proceedings of the Royal Colonial Institute",
1875-76, vol. xii. p. 203.]</p>
<p>One of the greatest series of events under the important
administration of Sir Richard MacDonnell was in connection with
the framing and passing the Parliament Bill. On the 11th of
August, 1855, a <i>Gazette Extraordinary</i> was issued
containing a despatch from Lord John Russell with reference to
the South Australian Parliament Bill, from which it appeared that
Sir Henry Young and his advisers had misconceived the intentions
of her Majesty's Government in granting certain enlarged powers
to the local Legislature. The Bill, therefore, was not taken as
an expression of the wishes of the majority, and as it was
supposed that the colonists, if allowed the opportunity of
arriving at a free and independent decision as to what they
considered the best form of constitution for the colony, would
reconsider and amend the Bill, it was recommended that such
opportunity should be given by the dissolution of the elective
portion of the then existing Council.</p>
<p>Four days later the dissolution of the Legislative Council was
announced. "The incubus of nomineeism," said the <i>Register</i>,
"had pressed heavily on the natural energies of the people's
representatives, and the elaborate and positive misinterpretation
of Imperial despatches on the part of the Executive had proved a
fatal snare to an inexperienced Assembly."</p>
<p>The first Representative Council was no more, and the people
were now called upon to reconstitute the Legislature under
different auspices and for greater purposes than before. The
future welfare of the colony depended upon their action. They
were not called upon to make an ordinary law, but to elect men to
make a Constitution which should more or less determine the
nature of all laws to be subsequently enacted.</p>
<p>"We are laying the foundations," continued the
<i>Register</i>, "of a new political and social state. We are
deciding whether public opinion shall be taken as the source of
legislative authority, or whether the people are yet to be held
in the leading-strings of Imperial domination."</p>
<p>The Government put forth an elaborate outline of a
Constitution Bill for the consideration of the next Legislative
Council, but the proposed measure was not received with any
degree of approval, and it was evident that it was the result of
hasty or ill-advised consideration. Sir Richard did not press his
measure, and expressed the hope that when the new Council met
they would hit upon the form of Constitution best suited to the
country.</p>
<p>The writs for the election of members for the new Council were
issued on the 17th of August, and from that time forth meetings
were held in all parts of the colony to hear the opinions of the
candidates for legislative honours.</p>
<p>Excitement culminated on the 20th and 21st of September, the
days fixed for the election in most of the districts, and, as if
to demonstrate the need for the ballot, scenes were enacted at
some of the polling booths, such as few would desire to see
repeated. West Adelaide took the lead in this unenviable
particular. When from the balcony of the Exchange Hotel it was
announced that Mr. Forster was at the head of the poll, the
partisans of Mr. Fisher rushed to the balcony, with a yell,
pulled down the flags and tore them to shreds, and then descended
and charged the crowd. Police on foot failing to scatter the
rioters, "mounted troopers, led by the commissioner of police,
galloped with drawn swords into the thickest of the fight, and
the admirable and determined movements of this body had a very
salutary effect upon the infuriated partisans, several of whom
were captured" (<i>vide</i> local paper).</p>
<p>On the 1st of November the opening of the new Legislative
Council took place, on which occasion the new Council Chamber,
handsome and well furnished, was occupied for the first time for
the transaction of the business of the country.</p>
<p>In his introductory speech, the Governor alluded to the
gratifying acknowledgment by her Majesty's Government of the
rapid growth of the colony, as shown by its recent separation
from the control of the New South Wales Government, and modestly
mentioned the fact that the Governor of South Australia was no
longer merely Lieutenant-Governor, but held the commission of
"Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of South Australia",
formerly held by the Governor-General at Sydney.</p>
<p>It still remained the special privilege, however, of the
Governor-General to originate measures applicable to the whole of
the Australian colonies&mdash;all measures, in short, requiring
as it were federal action for the promotion of great objects
common to all the Australian colonies.</p>
<p>When the all-absorbing question of a new Constitution came
before the Legislature, the Governor, notwithstanding the rebuff
he had received in the rejection of his first proposals, informed
the Council that he still retained the preference he had avowed
for a single Chamber only during the youthful stage of the
colony's progress, although aware that the proposition would not
meet with many supporters. But whatever inconvenience might arise
from a double Chamber, he felt it was better and wiser to adopt
those inconveniences, if supported by public opinion and
sympathy, than to strive for the most ideal form of government in
opposition to the feelings of the community&mdash;sentiments
which even Lord Chesterfield would have been justified in setting
before his son.</p>
<p>The Governor then gave the full outlines of the new
Constitution Bill, but it soon became evident that the Council
was not very favourable to the proposed Government measure. To
avoid the rejection of it altogether, the Government suggested a
compromise, namely, that if its second reading were carried, the
Council would not be pledged to any of its clauses, and with this
understanding the Council agreed to go into committee on the
measure.</p>
<p>The Bill, as altered and amended in committee, provided for
two Chambers, both elective&mdash;one of eighteen members, to be
elected by the whole colony as one constituency; the other of
thirty-six members, to be chosen by a certain number of districts
equally arranged, and divided on the basis of population. In the
Legislative Council, or Upper House, six members were to retire
every four years, and for the House of Assembly the elections
were to be triennial. The qualification of voters for the former
was to be a freehold of &pound;50 clear value, a leasehold of
&pound;10 per annum with three years to run, a right of purchase,
or a tenancy of the value of &pound;25. For the latter a manhood
suffrage, with six months' registration, was all that was
required. All voting to be by ballot. Responsible government was
to be secured by requiring ministers to be elected by the
constituencies, and when elected only to sit and vote in their
own Chamber. All money Bills to originate in the House of
Assembly. All official appointments and dismissals to be in the
power of the ministry, and no Governor's warrant for the payment
of money to be valid unless countersigned by the Chief
Secretary.</p>
<p>As regarded the civil list, it was provided that instead of a
bonus for the risk of loss of office by non-election, a moderate
annual allowance was to be made to the Colonial Secretary,
Treasurer, Advocate-General, and Commissioner of Crown Lands in
the event of actual loss of office.</p>
<p>After passing through a severe ordeal, the third reading of
the Constitution Bill in its altered and amended form took place
on the 2nd of January, 1856, and the Bill was passed.</p>
<p>The year 1855 had been characterized by great depression in
trade, consequent mainly upon the dry seasons that prevailed
during the year and the one preceding it, causing a very
deficient harvest; this reacted on all branches of industry, and
gave a decided check to the rapid progress the colony had been
making for two or three years previously. With the quantity of
grain and flour exported, and the shortness of the supply, fears
were entertained whether a sufficient stock had been kept in the
colony to last till the harvest; fears that happily proved
groundless.</p>
<p>The impetus given to trade by the large quantities of gold
sent and brought from Victoria in 1852-53 had raised the price of
almost everything. Land had reached a fictitious value both in
town and country; wages had increased to such an extent as to
render it impossible to employ labour except for indispensable
and very remunerative undertakings; and, as provisions were still
high in price, there was a strong disinclination to lower the
rates in the labour market notwithstanding the excessive
supply.</p>
<p>During this and several subsequent years, all classes of the
community were slow to believe that, as the extraordinary influx
of gold had ceased, prices must approximate to something near
their normal rates before the colony could again be in a stable,
healthy, and really prosperous condition. The suddenness of
wealth had induced habits of extravagance which were not so easy
to break off as to contract, and the absolute necessity for
retrenchment in affairs public and private produced a general
feeling of dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>After passing the Constitution Bill, the Council might very
gracefully have retired upon its honours; but there were still
certain pressing interests of the colony to be protected, and,
with a view to retrenchment, the next business of the Council was
to institute a searching examination into the public departments
and accounts. The public service had to a certain extent become
disarranged from the same causes which had produced so great an
effect on the community at large&mdash;the influx of capital from
the gold-fields. An Estimate Committee was appointed on the
previous 13th of November (1855), and during its sittings five
several reports were laid before the House, all of which were
adopted or received by the Council. The committee sat
seventy-five days, examined forty-nine officials and other
witnesses, and elicited answers to 6193 questions.</p>
<p>The investigations of the committee ** excited almost as much
interest as the discussion of the Constitution. Every department
was overhauled; every item of expenditure was checked; and the
estimates for the year were reduced to the tune of some
&pound;40,000. Of course, retrenchment began in the Civil
Service, as it always does everywhere; and a manly protest by the
Governor, transmitted in a memorandum to the Legislative Council,
will be read with interest by every Civil Servant, in both
hemispheres, who may chance to see it:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[** The committee (appointed by ballot) was made
up as follows:&mdash;Mr. B.T. Finniss, Colonial Secretary,
Messrs. Baker, Dutton. Forster, Kingston, Reynolds, and
Younghusband.]</p>
<p>"The tone in which the Government service has been alluded to
more than once by the committee; the ever-recurring attempt to
drive as hard a bargain as possible with a body of gentlemen
willing to toil hard for the sake of the country&mdash;but not to
be thanklessly driven as well as underpaid&mdash;the extreme
economy enforced in extensive departments, such as public works
and the police, in which another but most important class of the
community is largely interested&mdash;all these and other
concurring circumstances are fast producing results which, ere
long, there may be time to deplore, but not to remedy. There is a
feeling gradually springing up that the service, which had been a
badge of honour, is being changed into a badge of humiliation,
and in these colonies freemen, whether their station be humble or
exalted, will not brook to be looked down on by any man or body
of men whatever. Fairer fields for enterprise and better rewards
for industry and character are even now being sought out by
numbers who had chosen this colony as their home, and had made
her service their ambition."</p>
<p>The action of the Governor in sending this
memorandum&mdash;which took up several other points&mdash;was
severely censured, and a vote was moved and seconded declaring it
to be "an irregular and improper interference in the
constitutional action of the House and its committees." The
wording of the resolution was, however, supposed to be toned down
by an amendment "that the Governor's memorandum contains matter
which is offensive to this House, and that the good understanding
between the Government and the Legislature is not calculated to
be maintained by transmitting such documents to this Council."
Happily, the Governor was not puffed into space by this
"counterblast", and the incident is amusing mainly as showing the
political amenities of that day.</p>
<p>Apart from this little misunderstanding, it was well known and
generally acknowledged that the main object of the inquiry was to
secure the greatest economy of the public money with a due regard
to the maintenance of the public departments in an efficient and
adequate manner, and with the least interruption of public works
and matters connected with the general progress of the colony.
The Government bore testimony to the value of the labours of the
committee by largely adopting their suggestions.</p>
<p>The committee was greatly indebted to the efficient services
of the very able Auditor-General, Captain W.L. O'Halloran, who
aided them in many important particulars, and was mainly
instrumental, in fact, in making their inquiries possible.</p>
<p>About this time there was a mania for select committees; in
addition to the one we have referred to, others were appointed
during the session on the following subjects:&mdash;The colonial
agency; the excessive female immigration; the distillation laws;
the treatment of lunatics; the discipline and management of the
police force; and the proposed proclamation of the Sydney coinage
as a legal tender in South Australia.</p>
<p>One other measure claiming a notice on account of its
magnitude and importance was the Adelaide Waterworks and Drainage
Act, by which the Colonial Treasurer was empowered to borrow
&pound;280,000 on the credit of the general revenue, to 'bear six
per cent. interest, with four per cent. added as a redemption
fund.* The Bill was passed at the close of the session, and it is
somewhat remarkable that, considering the sum proposed to be
borrowed, and the heavy taxes to which the citizens would be
subject, very little notice was taken of the matter by the public
until it was too late. It is not impossible that, as the proposal
had been so long pending, and the citizens had seen so many
unsuccessful attempts to bring it to an issue, they took it for
granted the Bill would not be passed.</p>
<p class="foot">[* It was required also to set apart
&pound;28,000 annually to pay interest and amount of redeemable
bonds.]</p>
<p>But the citizens were gainers in the end. The water supply had
always been sadly deficient in quantity and inferior in quality,
and they had ever before their eyes the fear of epidemics and the
risk of desolating fires.</p>
<p>The session, opened on the 1st of November, 1855, was
prorogued on the 4th of June, 1856, and, notwithstanding two or
three adjournments, was the longest held in the colony up to that
time. No less than fifty Bills were introduced, of which
thirty-five passed. In his closing address the Governor said,
"The session about to close will long be remembered as that in
which the principles were established and the broad foundations
laid of the Constitution under which South Australia will, I
trust, long continue to extend that prosperity which, under
Divine Providence, has hitherto blessed the energy and honourable
industry of her children. I confidently expect that the extended
political power entrusted to the people of this country, and the
universal suffrage conceded by the new Constitution, will prove,
in reality, a safe and conservative measure; and, whilst
conferring the utmost possible powers of self-government, will
render stronger and more enduring than ever the cherished ties of
affection and loyalty which link this province to the throne of
our respected and beloved Sovereign. I have therefore felt much
pleasure in recommending that the New Constitution Bill should
receive the royal assent; and in the event of any of its clauses
appearing to exceed the powers of this Legislature, that an
imperial Act should be passed, ratifying the measure as far as
might be judged expedient, in preference to returning the Bill
for further amendment."</p>
<p>On the 24th of October, 1856, the Governor received important
despatches from England, together with the new Constitution
unaltered, which had been assented to by her Majesty at a Cabinet
council held in Buckingham Palace on the 24th of June, 1856. It
was entitled "An Act to establish a Constitution for South
Australia, and to grant a Civil List to her Majesty." On the very
same day that the despatches were received in the colony, the
Governor proclaimed the new Constitution and the appointment of
the new Ministry.** Contemporaneous with the proclamation in the
colony of the New Constitution Act, the new Waste Lands Act was
to have the force of law, transferring to the colonial
Legislature the absolute control of the land fund. By this Act
the Crown vested in the colonial Legislature the whole of the
unsold and unappropriated territory of the colony, and the power
also to use the funds arising from the disposal of the said lands
in any way that might seem most advisable or desirable.</p>

<p class="foot">These salaries, of course, present a striking
contrast to those fixed in the year 1836.]</p>
<p>The old Council assembled on the 11th of November, and the
session was brought to a close on the 11th of December, having
only held seventeen sittings. It was the last session of the
partly elective and partly nominee Legislature, but the Council
was not dissolved till the issue of the writs for the election of
the new Parliament. During the short time that the
representatives of the people had been entrusted with the partial
control of the affairs of the colony, they had worked with so
much zeal and ability as to entitle them to a foremost position
in the forthcoming elections. The members of the Executive had
won golden opinions from the working classes, by securing the
partial discontinuance of immigration.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that so much of the time and thought of people
and rulers had been taken up in discussing the new Constitution,
the year was not barren in results for the general good in other
spheres of action. The harvest had been abundant, and a
proportionate exportation of wheat and flour had yielded liberal
returns. The value of wheat and flour exported amounted to the
enormous sum of &pound;528,320 13<i>s</i>. 4:<i>d</i>. Great
progress, too, had been made in public works; the Adelaide City
and Port Railway had been opened to the public, and the Gawler
line as far as to Salisbury; while "railway extension" was one of
the main topics of discussion. One of the finest bridges in the
colony, to connect North and South Adelaide, had been constructed
at a cost, including its approaches, of about &pound;20,000.
Commissioners for carrying out the great waterworks scheme had
been appointed and operations had commenced. The lighthouse on
Troubridge Shoal had exhibited its warning light for the first
time, and the necessary sums had been voted for similar beacons
on Cape Borda and Cape Northumberland. The number of immigrants
was small in comparison with the previous year, and, owing to the
severe censures passed on the Land and Emigration Commissioners
in England, they were of a much better class.</p>
<p>The year 1857 commenced with extensive preparations for the
election of members for the first Parliament of South Australia.
Meetings of candidates were held in all parts of the country up
to the time of the issue of writs for the several divisions and
districts, after which time, as prescribed by the Act, no further
addresses were permitted. This "gagging" clause was roundly
condemned&mdash;more especially by candidates who were late in
the field&mdash;as an infraction of liberty of speech, the right
of free-born Englishmen.</p>
<p>Not a few, to whom the words "ballot" and "universal suffrage"
suggested ideas of democracy, republicanism, and anarchy, thought
that the knell of the colony's ruin had been sounded. As the time
for the elections drew near it was found that to fill the
fifty-four seats in the two Houses, namely, eighteen to the
Legislative Council and thirty-six in the House of Assembly,
there were twenty-seven candidates for the former and sixty-two
for the latter, making a total of eighty-nine. On the day of
nomination the discovery was made that nine candidates were
unopposed.</p>
<p>The 9th of March was the day fixed for the elections, and it
was announced that it would be a public holiday. Those who had
witnessed the quiet and orderly manner in which the several
candidates were nominated had no doubt come to the conclusion
that what many considered the glory of an election had departed.
There had been no banners and ribbons, no music and orations, no
shouting and fighting. The returning-officer had simply opened
and read the letters proposing and seconding the various
candidates, and this, with three cheers for the Queen, concluded
the proceedings.</p>
<p>The Electoral Act provided for the conduct of the elections in
a similar quiet and orderly manner. There were to be no hustings,
and the booths or polling-places were to be a specified distance
from a public-house. No wonder, therefore, that on the day of
election people were seen quietly resorting to the polling-places
as if they were going to exercise a national right and perform an
important duty. This done, there was no inducement to linger at
the spot, as it was provided that there would be no declaration
of the state of the poll until the final stage was reached. It
was a striking contrast to the scenes enacted at the last
elections, and all sober-minded people congratulated themselves
upon the reform.*</p>

<p>For the election the colony had been divided into "districts"
and "divisions", the former electing members for the House of
Assembly, the latter for the Legislative Council. The members for
the latter House were to represent the whole colony, hence the
dividing of it for the purpose of facilitating the elections. The
members of the House of Assembly were to represent the districts
which elected them, and the number of representatives for each
district was regulated, as far as practicable, on a population
basis.</p>
By direction of her Majesty the members of the Legislative
Council and the Speaker of the House of Assembly were to have the
title of "Honourable" conferred upon them, and were officially to
be addressed as such while occupying seats in the said Council,
and the Speaker while holding office in such capacity. The
members of the Executive Council (or of the Ministry) were also
to enjoy a similar privilege or honour.
<p>On the 22nd of April the new Parliament met, about a thousand
persons assembling on North Terrace to witness and cheer the
arrival of the members and the Governor.</p>
<p>There is something really amusing, but at the same time very
splendid, in this inauguration of a Parliament for South
Australia. Let the reader try and realize it. The whole
population of the colony was estimated at 109,000; that is to
say, fewer by some hundreds than are to be found to-day in such
towns in England as Brighton, Bolton, Portsmouth, Leicester, or
Cardiff, and considerably less than half the population of
Bristol, Nottingham, or Bradford. The territory of the colony, on
the other hand, was nearly three times as large as that of the
whole of Great Britain; that is to say, it comprehended an area
of 300,000 square miles, or 192 millions of acres. Only twenty
years before, the land was practically uninhabited, with here and
there a wattle-and-dab hut, or a canvas tent; population, and a
certain amount of wealth, had poured in from all quarters, but
ruinous reverses had been experienced. Out of these the people
had struggled, holding on with tenacity to each success until it
had been made more successful; throwing off one by one the
leading-strings of paternal government until they attained
political manhood.</p>
<p>To this handful of people, sixteen thousand miles, by sailing
ship, away from England, composed of men, not as a rule those who
had made their mark in the old country, or who were acquainted by
practical experience with the usages of the Imperial Parliament,
but simply a body of sturdy, loyal, and enterprising Englishmen
seeking in one of the rising commonwealths of Greater Britain to
perpetuate the institutions of their native land&mdash;to them
was committed a system of responsible government involving the
principles of universal suffrage, vote by ballot, equal electoral
districts, and triennial Parliaments, together with the absolute
control of revenues hitherto under the Crown, namely, the
proceeds of the sale and lease of the waste lands within the
province, and the unfettered management of the public purse,
whether in taxation or expenditure. It is equally a wonder that
the Imperial Government should have had sufficient confidence in
the ability. loyalty, and discretion of the South Australians to
entrust them with such a responsibility, as that men should have
been found prepared and eager to accept it. "It must be
confessed," said the London <i>Times</i> in a somewhat sarcastic
article, "that it is rather an odd position for a new community
of rising tradesmen, farmers, cattle-breeders, builders,
mechanics, with a sprinkling of doctors and attorneys, to find
that it is suddenly called upon to find Prime Ministers,
Cabinets, a Ministerial side, an Opposition side, and all the
apparatus of a Parliamentary Government&mdash;to awake one fine
morning and discover that this is no longer a colony, but a
nation, saddled with all the rules and traditions of the
political life of the mother country."</p>
<p>Saddled with cumbersome and costly Government machinery the
colony certainly was, and, in addition, it was subject to abuses
to a great extent irremediable. For example, the power of
governing was placed, by universal suffrage, in the hands of
those who not only possessed the smallest stake in the colony,
but were the least intelligent. It is amusing to remember that
while the Constitution Act was under consideration, an endeavour
was being made to establish an educational test, at least to the
extent of reading and writing, as some guarantee of fitness for
the exercise of the franchise; but even this was overruled by the
democratic element in the Council as constituted at that
time.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, with all the drawbacks, inevitable in the
circumstances, the colonists hailed responsible government with
enthusiasm, and after it had been tested by experience, they
would not for any consideration have returned to the old state of
affairs.</p>
<p>There was much work to be done on that auspicious day when the
first South Australian Parliament met&mdash;the reading of the
proclamation for assembling the Parliament, and of the commission
for taking the usual oaths; the election of President for the
Legislative Council (the Hon. J.H. Fisher), and of Speaker for
the House of Assembly (Mr. G.S. Kingston), and to arrange the
order, by lot, in which one-third of the Council should retire
every four years. Then came the opening address, dealing first
with the financial state of the province and then with the
measures which would claim the attention of Parliament, including
a Bill with regard to waste lands, an Education Bill (leaving
untouched, however, the principle of the existing law), and other
Bills relating to public works.</p>
<p>It was not to be expected that all the new machinery, now put
into motion for the first time, would work well and smoothly at
the start off, and it was not long before there was a decided
"hitch". The first important disarrangement threatened to produce
a deadlock. The occasion which brought the two Houses into
collision was an amendment by the "Council" of a Bill passed by
the "Assembly". The alteration made affected the principle of the
Bill, and went so far as to strike out a clause providing for the
repeal of the dues upon shipping. This was considered by the
Assembly to be a breach of its privileges, and they passed a
resolution calling upon the Council "to reconsider the Bill,
inasmuch as it is a breach of privilege for the Legislative
Council to modify any money Bill passed by this House."</p>
<p>This resolution was met by another in the Council, that "the
policy pursued by the Ministry in attempting to legislate by
resolution only in one branch of the Legislature is detrimental
to the interests of the colony, subversive of the Constitution,
and calculated to bring about a collision between the two Houses
of Parliament." This resolution was, however, withdrawn, and the
alternative course was&mdash;a battle on the question of
privilege or a peace conference. The former course was chosen,
and, after an adjournment for the preparation of the estimates,
the matter came on for debate.</p>
<p>It would not interest the general public to follow the long
and wearisome discussions that ensued; suffice it to say that for
a considerable time public business was delayed; a long-winded
opinion of the President, who was learned in the law, was
obtained; much good temper, time, and eloquence were wasted on
both sides, and in the end only a feeble compromise was effected.
Still there were some points of interest in the great "Privilege
Question", as it was called, that are worth recording. When it
was found that there would be a deadlock unless some way of
escape could be devised, a conference was agreed upon, and
committees were appointed by both Houses to draw up "reasons" for
the position taken up on either side. Those of the Legislative
Council were to the effect that there was no analogy between the
Imperial Parliament and the Parliament of South Australia,
inasmuch as the British Upper House was hereditary and that of
the province was elective, and as such was as much a guardian of
the public purse as the Assembly, and further, that, with the
exception of "originating" money Bills, the powers of the two
colonial Chambers were equal. It was contended that the word
"originate" should be taken in its sense, and applied only to the
introduction of any money Bill. The Assembly, on the other hand,
stood up for the analogy between the powers possessed by the
British House of Commons and the colonial House of Assembly, and
that, notwithstanding the fact that the term "originate" had not
been defined by either legislative or judicial interpretation,
both Houses must be influenced by reasons drawn from analogy as
to the practice and privilege of the Imperial Parliament, and
that, of course, reason and practice were conclusive in favour of
the view of its privileges taken by the House of Assembly. That
House further contended that as the right of the House of Commons
to originate money Bills was claimed by that House, and had
always been allowed by the Crown and the Lords as a common-law
right, the claim of the House of Commons of excluding the House
of Lords from modifying or altering such money Bills was a
Parliamentary privilege inherent in, and flowing from, that
right; therefore, as the Constitution Act vested in the House of
Assembly the exclusive right of originating money Bills, the
right to exclude the Legislative Council from modifying or
altering such Bills was by direct and necessary implication also
conferred.</p>
<p>Such being the attitude of both parties, public business was
at a standstill until the feeble compromise aforesaid was
effected. Briefly, it was as follows:&mdash;That while the
Assembly should originate all money Bills, it should be competent
for the Council to suggest alterations; but should those
suggestions not be heeded, the Bills might be returned by the
Assembly for reconsideration, and be either assented to or
rejected by the Council. The Council still claimed its right to
deal with the monetary affairs of the province, but would not
enforce its right to deal with the ordinary details of the annual
expenses of the Government.</p>
<p>These "concessions" were almost unanimously agreed to, and the
crisis was averted for the time being.</p>
<p>Another important feature in this first session of Parliament
was the frequent changes in the Ministry. The first, consisting
principally of the Executive members of the former Legislature,
held office until the 20th of August, having, after several
defeats, tendered their resignations on the 10th of that month.
The next was known as the Baker Ministry (Hon. John Baker, Chief
Secretary), and held office from the 21st to the 27th, when, on a
vote of want of confidence moved by Mr. Torrens, they resigned,
and the Torrens Ministry came in and held office from the 1st to
the 24th of September, when, Mr. Hanson having moved an adverse
vote declaring a certain proclamation of the Governor to be
"unwarranted and illegal", he was called upon to form the Hanson
Ministry&mdash;and so on.</p>
<p>During this session Mr. (afterwards Sir) R.R. Torrens
introduced his celebrated Bill for the transfer of real property,
which has created more interest and brought about a greater
reformation in the law of real estate than any measure ever
enacted thereon either in England or in the colonies. No serious
objections were raised against it at the time, and the Bill
passed its third reading in the House of Assembly on the 15th of
December with a majority of twelve, and in the Legislative
Council on the 26th of January, 1858, with a majority of
five.</p>
<p>The design of Mr. Torrens was not only to dispense with
transferring real estate in the first instance by deed, but also
in every subsequent transaction where a deed would have been
considered necessary.</p>
<p>"The first great principle of the Act," says Mr. Harcus, "is
the transferring of real property by registration of title
instead of by deeds; the second is absolute indefeasibility of
title. The system is very simple and very inexpensive. The
certificate of title is registered in the official registry at
the Lands' Titles Office, the owner obtaining a duplicate
certificate. All transactions affecting the land appear on the
face of the certificate, so that at a glance it may be seen
whether the property is encumbered or any charges are made upon
it. If an owner wishes to mortgage his land, he takes his
certificate to the office and has the transaction marked upon it.
If he wants to sell, he passes over the certificate to the
purchaser, and the transaction is registered. Any man of ordinary
intelligence can do all that is necessary for himself, when once
his property is brought under the Act." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** "South Australia: its History and Resources",
by W. Harcus.]</p>
<p>The cost was nominal. A percentage of one half-penny in the
penny was paid, when the land was for the first time brought
under the law, to ensure the soundness of the transaction, and
from this fund the State guaranteed to protect rightful
proprietors when lands were brought by others under the Act. It
was satisfactory to know that this provision was almost
superfluous. When the accrued fund had reached &pound;30,000,
only &pound;300 had been required to meet demands.</p>
<p>After accomplishing his arduous task, Mr. Torrens took a trip
early in 1860 to the neighbouring colonies, where he met with a
series of ovations, and was hailed as a general benefactor, each
colony being anxious to put a similar law into operation. On his
return he was appointed to the office of Registrar-General for
the purpose of carrying out the measure. Various honours were
heaped upon him, and he was subsequently knighted. It was not to
be expected that Mr. Torrens would be able to carry everything
before him in peace. In 1860 two cases of litigation arose
relating to breaches of contract on the part of purchasers of
land, and resulted in a keen contest between the legal profession
and the friends of the Act. The decision of the judges was
adverse to the Act, and it was determined to carry the case to
the Court of Appeal, when Mr. Justice Boothby made the singular
discovery that under the New Constitution Act no such tribunal
existed!</p>
<p>It was while this case was under judicial consideration that
fourteen members of the legal profession drew up a lengthy
petition to the Duke of Newcastle, Secretary of State for the
Colonies, praying that the Real Property Act might be referred to
the law officers of the Crown for their opinion as to its
legality and validity, before it received the assent of her
Majesty.</p>
<p>Several colonial lawyers had, prior to this, addressed a
letter to the Attorney-General, in which they expressed their
opinion that the new Act was repugnant to the laws of England,
and offered to draw up a fresh Bill, This offer was declined with
thanks.</p>
<p>Then occurred a long series of public meetings and debates.
The long-winded and utterly wearisome discussions would not
interest anybody if they were reproduced, even in the briefest
outline, here. Like most other reforms, this important and
beneficent one had to encounter and overcome opposition from
nearly all quarters&mdash;its advocates in their excess of zeal
overstated its strength, while its opponents left nothing undone
to find out its weak points. It was not in human nature that
lawyers who had made small fortunes by their tedious "provided
always" and "and whereas" could sit still and contemplate these
time-honoured forms, which had been considered indispensable to a
good title, being ruthlessly swept away; still less could they
gaze upon vanishing six and eightpences and thirteen and
fourpences with equanimity. What wonder, therefore, that they
aroused themselves and fought to the death!</p>
<p>But the go-ahead South Australians were neither to be
browbeaten nor hoodwinked. They saw that the old system of
conveyancing (still adored in some old-fashioned
countries&mdash;the mother country, to wit) was costly and
cumbrous, and failed to give that security which is the only
excuse for costliness, whereas the new system under the Real
Property Act was simple, cheap, and secure. Moreover, it was
specially adapted to meet the need of a colony where land was a
common possession and a matter of daily bargain, instead of being
the luxury of the few, and when once possessed was rarely parted
with, except under circumstances of necessity.</p>
<p>Of course, there were imperfections in the system on its first
introduction, but this is not so much a matter of wonder as that
these imperfections were so few and were easily remediable, while
its needs of amendment pale into insignificance beside the
protracted legislation which has been found necessary in the
mother country to bolster up the principles of the old system, to
remove its anomalies, and to simplify its procedure.</p>
<p>From these discussions on the Real Property Act, there sprang
up another&mdash;one of the most painful, and withal notable, in
the annals of the colony. It may be well, perhaps, to tell the
story in this place, although the case dragged its weary length
along for years. The facts were briefly these:&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Boothby having expressed his doubts as to the
validity of certain Acts passed by the colonial Legislature, on
the ground of their repugnance to the laws of England, rendered
himself obnoxious to the Parliament, the press, and the public,
and this was greatly increased when he went so far as to
absolutely decide in the Supreme Court against the validity of
the Peal Property Act and other Acts which had not then received
the royal assent. A motion for the appointment of a Select
Committee "to examine into the recent decisions and conduct of
His Honour, Mr. Justice Boothby, and to report thereon" was
opposed by Mr. G.F. Angas on the ground that the whole matter
turned upon hearsay and newspaper reports. But the motion was
carried, and Mr. Angas was one of those chosen to act upon the
committee.</p>
<p>Before this tribunal Mr. Boothby declined to appear; and this
fact, perchance, added to the bitterness of the report of the
Committee, a report from which Mr. Angas very strongly dissented,
on the ground that the evidence adduced distinctly proved that
the colonial judges had power to declare illegal and invalid Acts
which had been passed by the Legislature of the colony, assented
to by the Governor, and left to their operation by her Majesty,
which was borne out by various decisions of the Courts of Law in
other colonies and in England, and was consistent with the
recognized and admitted principles of constitutional law. On this
and on many other grounds, he stood out in defence of Mr. Justice
Boothby, and a storm arose. So great was the outcry that meetings
were held in various parts of the colony for the purpose of
hearing the respective members give an account of the action each
had taken in the matter.</p>
<p>By-and-by a petition was sent to the Queen, praying her to
remove Mr. Justice Boothby from the bench, but it failed in its
object; and instead of the judge being reprimanded, as some
confidently anticipated, the colonial Legislature received a
severe censure from the Home Government.</p>
<p>Not satisfied with this, a second address to the Crown was
forwarded in 1866, to which the Secretary of State for the
Colonies replied that the <i>ex parte</i> statements against the
judge were insufficient grounds for his removal, and that unless
the colony would agree to have the question argued before the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the local Government
must deal with the case themselves.</p>
<p>This they resolved to do, and in June, 1867, a series of
charges were preferred against Mr. Boothby, who simply protested,
but took no steps to defend himself.</p>
<p>The specific charges laid at his door were presented to
Parliament in the following resolutions:&mdash;"(1) That he
persistently refuses to administer laws duly enacted by the
Parliament of South Australia. (2) That he declines to give
effect to the Imperial statute known as the Validating Act. (3)
That he is accustomed from the Bench to impugn the validity of
the local Court of Appeals. (4) That he refuses to conform his
judgment to the decision of the Supreme Court. (5) That he
obstructs the course of justice by perversity and habitual
disregard of judicial propriety. (6) That he has delivered
judgments and <em>dicta</em> not in accordance with law."</p>
<p>The matter was ably and lengthily debated in the Legislative
Council, but on the motion for the removal of Mr. Boothby, Mr.
Angas seconded an amendment for inquiry and report by a Select
Committee, which was lost. In his speech he pleaded for justice
and impartiality, for calm and dispassionate inquiry, instead of
"presenting to her Majesty's Privy Council mere declarations
sought to be proved by newspaper reports, and even by the reports
of the very men who made the allegations."</p>
<p>The Government carried their point, but it was afterwards
generally admitted that it would have been better in every
respect to have acted on the representations of Mr. Angas and the
few others who held the same views.</p>
<p>The whole case was difficult and delicate throughout, and was
dealt with in a manner which did not reflect great credit upon
the chief actors in it, and brought upon them the severe censure
of the Imperial Government.</p>
<p>The colonial Parliament took upon itself the grave
responsibility of removing Mr. Boothby from office, and he at
once declared his intention to appeal to the Judicial Committee
of the Privy Council; but illness, brought on by ceaseless
vexation and anxiety, supervened, and on the 21st of June, 1868,
his death terminated the controversy.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Quoted from the "Life of George Fife Angas",
pp. 377-380.]</p>
<br>
<p>We must now go back to the year 1857, to the close of the
first session of the first South Australian Parliament. It had
been one of peculiar interest and importance, and had
accomplished an amazing amount of work, notwithstanding its
endless discussions. Twenty-seven select committees had been
appointed, seven by the Legislative Council and twenty by the
House of Assembly, while forty Bills had been introduced, twenty
of which passed both Houses.</p>
<p>During the year the federal movement between the colonies
occupied much attention out of doors and in Parliament. It
appeared that the Australian Association in England had addressed
her Majesty's Government on the subject, and a draft Bill had
been prepared, providing for the federative union of the
colonies, to embrace such objects as lighthouses along the coast,
railways, navigation of inland rivers, a postal system, and other
affairs in which the colonies were collectively interested.
Select Committees inquired into the subject, and did not report
dead against it; but the idea of federation was altogether
unpalatable to the majority, and the matter was for the time
being allowed to drop.</p>
<p>One step of a federal character was, however, taken by the
Parliament this session in levying a tax upon the landing of
Chinese in the colony&mdash;the Celestials having adopted the
plan of disembarking by thousands in South Australia and walking
overland to avoid the "head money" levied in Victoria on all such
arrivals in that colony by seaboard. Some of these visitors
proceeded up the Murray, but the large majority were landed at
Rivoli Bay or Guichen Bay, where they obtained guides to conduct
them to the Victoria gold diggings. The landing tax was
considered by the majority as being mainly for the benefit of the
sister colony, but it was denounced as illiberal, and was, after
a time, repealed. It served, however, to illustrate some of the
difficulties that must attend federal action.</p>
<p>On the 28th of December, 1857, the colony attained its
majority. In many respects it was the most eventful year of its
history, and it is not a little remarkable that it should, while
in its twenty-first year, have been entrusted with the entire
management of its own affairs by the introduction of responsible
government. There were other coincidences of the year. The first
pile had been driven for the erection of a jetty at Glenelg, the
first landing-place of the early settlers on the mainland; the
first wire of the intercolonial telegraph for connecting South
Australia with the neighbouring colonies had been fixed; the
railway had been opened to Gawler, one of the largest country
towns.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all the drawbacks of infancy&mdash;and they
had been many and severe&mdash;the colony stood in a strong,
vigorous, and healthy position at the age of maturity (reckoning
according to the years of manhood).</p>
<p>The population, in 1857, was estimated at 109,917; the land
alienated from the Crown from the foundation of the colony was
1,557,740 acres, the purchase money amounting to &pound;2,045,324
11<i>s</i>.; the quantity of land in cultivation was 235,965
acres; the number of horses, 26,220; of cattle, 310,400; of sheep
and lambs, 2,075,805; the value of imports, &pound;1,623,052; of
exports, the produce of the country, and mainly cereals,
minerals, and wool, &pound;1,744,184; the number of flour mills
was 70; of manufactories, 226; of post-offices, 110; of letters
passed through the post-office, 934,550; of newspapers, 849,946;
number of day schools, 167, with 7480 scholars; number of Sunday
schools, 192, with 10,576 scholars; places of worship, 300, with
accommodation for 50,000 persons; births, 5183; marriages, 1218;

<p>The celebration of Foundation Day was to have been a brilliant
affair, but a drenching rain marred the proceedings, which were
to have included the affixing a plate with a suitable inscription
on the old gum tree under whose branches the colony was
proclaimed in 1836, the land on which it stood having been given
to the Glenelg Corporation by the generous owner, Mr. J. Hector;
but the ceremony was dispensed with at that time.</p>
<p>The second session of the first Parliament was somewhat barren
in subjects of general interest. A Bill for levying an assessment
on stock led to the appointment of a Select Committee, who
recommended that the measure should be withdrawn; but,
notwithstanding this, the debate on the second reading extended
over seven days, and it finally passed both Houses without a
division. It was estimated that the revenue raised from this
source would amount to between &pound;20,000 and &pound;30,000
per annum; but it was found to be a difficult measure to carry
into effect, and created a great deal of dissatisfaction on the
part of the squatters. The annual value of the land held on lease
at the time of passing the Bill was estimated at from
&pound;80,000 to &pound;100,000. The distillation question, and
taxation generally, were also referred to a Select Committee, who
reported that, in their opinion, a system of collecting revenue
by a duty upon imports possessed advantages over any system of
direct taxation, and rendered any change inexpedient at that
time. A total repeal of the distillation laws was recommended,
and concurrently a reduction of the duty on imported spirits to
four shillings per gallon, and further reductions annually, until
a minimum duty of one shilling per gallon was reached. But no
definite action was then taken.</p>
<p>During the year (1858) a cloud "no bigger than a man's hand"
made its appearance, and before long spread far and wide. A
movement was set on foot by the working classes to obtain, if
possible, a total discontinuance of free immigration, on the
ground that it was unnecessary while so many in the colony were
out of employment. On the other hand, the view was taken that the
prevailing rate of wages rendered the profitable use of capital
impossible. Certainly a country possessing unlimited resources of
various kinds, and growing food for a population considerably
larger than it contained, ought not to have been in the position
in which South Australia then was.</p>
<p>The matter claimed much of the attention of the third session
of the first Parliament, which was opened in April (1859), much
earlier than usual, consequent upon an alteration in the
commencement of the financial year.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** On the fourth day of the session a singular
circumstance occurred in the House of Assembly, which nearly
necessitated another formal reopening of Parliament. After the
ordinary summons to the members, there was not a quorum in the
House. The Speaker, without considering that the days of meeting
had not been fixed, adjourned the House until one o'clock next
day; but remembering that he had no power to do this, he recalled
the departing members, and a few more dropping in who had either
not heard or had disregarded the previous summons, a House was
constituted.]</p>
<p>In July a "Political Association" was formed, the approaching
termination of the existing Parliament presenting a favourable
opportunity to the working classes for ventilating their
grievances generally, and for making arrangements for the return
of members who would defend their rights and promote their
interests. The "creed" of the Association was as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"(1) We believe the time has now arrived when immigration at
the public expense should cease. (2) We believe that property
should never be considered in comparison with manhood; that the
happiness and well-being of the mass is paramount to the
aggrandizement of the few. (3) We believe that all citizens
should have equal political rights. (4) We believe that members
of the Legislative Assembly should be paid. (5) We believe that
all lands alienated from the Crown and unimproved should be
taxed. (6) We believe in law reform. (7) We believe the press
should be free and unshackled."</p>
<p>Men are said to be almost always better than their creeds, and
the working men of South Australia, perhaps, did themselves an
injustice in issuing this bald programme. Their object was a
political crusade against the wealthier classes. Times were bad,
there was lack of employment, destitution had ensued;
dissatisfaction had laid a firm hold on mechanics and artisans,
and everything was ripe for the advent of the social demagogue
who had a panacea for every evil.</p>
<p>Many meetings were held. The first resolution passed at the
first meeting was in these simple and modest terms: "That his
Excellency would be pleased to remove from his councils the
present Ministry." Another, at a subsequent meeting, was to the
effect, "The widespread destitution is attributable to
absenteeism, and to the drainage of money from the colony for
immigration; "while another characterized a vote of &pound;2000
for the introduction of free immigration as "a policy wanting in
humanity, insulting to the understanding of the meanest capacity,
likely to compromise the present peace and order of the
community, and opposed to the future prosperity of the
colony."</p>
<p>Memorials to the Governor were drawn up, and deputations
appointed to present them. Sir Richard MacDonnell was a practical
man, and he dealt wisely and well with his democratic
petitioners.</p>
<p>"In my opinion," he said to one deputation, "the want of the
colony is the want most felt by all new countries worth
inhabiting, namely, more people to inhabit it and cultivate the
soil. The way to make the country wealthy is not necessarily by
stopping the influx of people. I have never known immigration,
well conducted, to interfere with legitimate wages; but, on the
other hand, an influx of inhabitants, unattended with a
corresponding influx of capital, is not, I admit, the way to
promote the healthy and prosperous settlement of any country."
Then, after urging them to use their political power wisely at
the next general election, he met a complaint that had been made
against the Government for not employing more labour in public
works.</p>
<p>"If you will allow me to offer you advice," he said, "it would
be that you should avoid this growing tendency to look to
Government, instead of to yourselves, and to cling to it in every
reverse or difficulty, rather than to rely on your own willing
hearts and strong arms. There is a fair field for the workman
here, as compared with England; and if the disposition to which I
have referred is persisted in, it will be a curse to the working
man, and the most serious impediment to the prosperity of the
colony. . . . The necessity for that self-reliance which can seek
and make employment is all the more evident because, before long,
we cannot calculate upon such large proceeds from the sale of
Crown lands as we have hitherto enjoyed, and you must remember
that it is from these sales that the principal amounts have been
derived for public works. . . ."</p>
<p>As the rules of the Destitute Asylum did not admit of relief
being granted to able-bodied individuals in good health, the
Government established a labour test to meet the case of those
who could not obtain work from any other source.* The rate fixed
for taskwork was so arranged as to allow men to earn from three
shillings to five shillings per day, and when they could not be
employed in this way, four shillings per day was to be the rate
of payment.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The Government adopted a similar plan to that
pursued by Governor Grey in 1841, except that the test rate of
1859 was more than double that of 1841.]</p>
<p>This was considered by the men as insufficient, and the
inevitable memorial to the Governor, urging that six shillings
should be the minimum price, was sent in.</p>
<p>Sir Richard, in reply, said he was grieved and disappointed to
find so many workmen in the vicinity of town still looking to
labour tests as a continuous means of obtaining a livelihood,
instead of merely using them in the way intended, namely, as
temporary makeshifts, whereby the industrious might gain time to
look out for more permanent and congenial employment, plenty of
which might be found, if diligently sought for. He justly
considered that any man who could earn four shillings, and
nevertheless remained idle because he could not earn six
shillings, might be considered as squandering the money he
refused to take, and disqualified himself from obtaining the
highest wages accorded to others of his class.</p>
<p>It was these circumstances which led to the formation of the
Working Men's Association, and subsequently the Political
Association, with its branches in various parts of the
colony&mdash;an association which exercised a powerful influence
in 'the election of members for the ensuing Parliament by
returning men who were pledged to represent their interest, and,
in some cases, theirs only. From the results which followed it
was clear that the other classes of the community had not
realized the power which the ballot and universal suffrage had
placed in the hands of working men.</p>
<p>The great depression in the labour market at this time could
be mainly traced to two causes&mdash;one a deficiency in the
wheat crop for four successive seasons, leading gradually to a
crisis, and the other a partial recovery from the disarrangement
caused by the exodus to the gold-fields, and the subsequent high
rate of wages obtainable when the influx of gold into the colony
took place, creating a fictitious, superficial, and temporary
state of prosperity, leading in its turn to a large amount of
improvidence, an erroneous view of the value of money, and other
more serious evils.</p>
<br>
<p>Early in July, 1859, news reached the colony that Austria had
declared war against Sardinia, and that active preparations were
being made in England, in the event of other European powers
being so involved as to necessitate Britain taking a part in the
contest. In August came the intelligence that hostilities had
commenced, that France had joined the Sardinians, and that some
desperate battles had been fought and won by those united Powers.
A proclamation by the Queen was forthwith issued by the Governor,
declaring the neutrality of Britain and requiring the "strict
observance of this attitude on the part of all the colonies and
dependencies of the British Empire."</p>
<p>While South Australia was quite prepared to obey this order
both in letter and in spirit, it was considered necessary to
follow the example of the mother country in making preparation
for any emergency. France was as much distrusted in Australia as
in England, and the existence of a French naval station at New
Caledonia, no great distance from the Australian coast, led the
colonists to be on the alert. A Militia Bill and a Volunteer
Force Bill were therefore passed through the Legislature, and the
Government proceeded to enrol the militia, but it was understood
that if two thousand volunteers offered their services the
militia would not be called out except in case of absolute
necessity.</p>
<p>Energetic steps were taken to enrol sufficient volunteers, and
rifle corps were formed in most of the districts, the Government
undertaking to provide rifles and ammunition on certain
conditions, together with a small sum towards uniform. Major
Nelson, of the 14th Regiment, the officer in command of the
military, was appointed inspecting field officer. By December,
sixteen companies were formed, upwards of six hundred volunteers
enrolled, rifle butts had been erected on the South Park-lands,
ball firing had been regularly practised, and two artillery
companies had commenced target practice.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Australia had been constituted a separate naval
station, independent of the East India and China station. Captain
Long, of H.M.S. <i>Iris</i>, was appointed commodore of the
second class; the <i>Iris</i>, <i>Elk</i>, <i>Niger</i>,
<i>Cordelia</i>, and <i>Pelorus</i> forming the Australian
squadron.</p>
<p>An event occurred in this year (1859) which will ever be
remembered by South Australians as one of the saddest, most
tragic, and most exciting in the annals of the colony.</p>
<p>In 1858 there arrived in the colony a splendid new steamship,
the <i>Admella</i>, for the Adelaide and Melbourne trade, her
name being a contraction and conjunction of the names of these
two cities. On Monday, the 8th of August, 1859, a telegram was
received in Adelaide from Mount Gambier, announcing that the
keeper of the lighthouse at Cape Northumberland had reported the
total wreck of the <i>Admella</i> at some little distance from
the cape, and the probable loss of nearly all on board. The news,
it was stated, had been communicated by two of the crew of the
ill-fated vessel, who had arrived at the lighthouse in an
exhausted condition.</p>
<p>When this startling and melancholy intelligence was circulated
there was distress and excitement in Adelaide such as had never
been witnessed before. It was known that the <i>Admella</i> had
left Port Adelaide on the 5th with between sixty and seventy
passengers on board, most of whom had relations and friends in
the city. The telegraph office was in consequence besieged, and
intense excitement prevailed. Unfortunately, no precise
information could be obtained, fragments of news only arrived at
intervals, and the suspense was painful in the extreme.</p>
<p>Early on Tuesday morning telegrams were received stating that
the steamer struck on a reef during foggy weather on Saturday and
broke into four pieces, the boats had been washed adrift, and
when the two men left, bodies were floating around them.
Passengers had offered money, jewellery, everything they had, to
be brought ashore, but the raft would only bear the two sailors;
the second mate had tried to reach the shore, but was drowned in
the attempt. Only the poop of the vessel was out of water, and
the wreck was at least a mile from the beach and twenty-five from
the lighthouse. A ray of hope came with the tale of sorrow. The
two men who had reached the shore were so bewildered that no
reliance was to be placed upon their report as to how many were
alive on the wreck.</p>
<p>Meanwhile all that could be done in Adelaide, over two hundred
and fifty miles away, was done. The <i>Corio</i> had been
despatched from the Port to render assistance. Then came hours
and days of intensely anxious suspense. Business generally was at
a standstill; both Houses of the Legislature met and adjourned
(two sons of the President of the Council had taken passage in
the vessel, and their fate was unknown).</p>
<p>Thus Tuesday passed away. Wednesday brought tidings that those
on the wreck had exchanged signals with those on shore, but
neither boat nor steamer was in sight. By the aid of a telescope
twenty persons were seen on the wreck, and a Mr. Rochfort was
recognized as one of them. A lifeboat had been despatched, but
she could not be got through the surf. Towards evening a steamer
three miles off was seen approaching, but the sea was too rough
for her to attempt a rescue. This was the last news received on
the fifth day that the survivors had been on the wreck, and the
third since the news reached Adelaide. Excitement was at white
heat, and it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that half the
citizens of Adelaide spent a sleepless night.</p>
<p>Early on Thursday morning the telegraph office was thronged by
a pale and anxious crowd. The first telegram announced that the
<i>Corio</i> was close by the wreck, that Rochfort, the captain,
the first mate, Mr. Magarey, and a woman were recognized, but
that the surf was too strong for any boat to live in it. Later in
the day came other telegrams stating that the survivors were
fewer, two having been seen to drop into the sea since daylight;
that the <i>Ladybird</i>, despatched from Melbourne, and the
<i>Ant</i> from Guichen Bay, were on the alert to render
assistance; that the lifeboat of the <i>Corio</i> had been
launched, but could not reach the wreck&mdash;it had got inside
the reef and been thrown up on the beach, and the survivors
witnessing the mishap had sent up a despairing shout, distinctly
heard on shore, as if their last hope had gone. The wreck stood
above high water as high as a man could reach, and, the hull
having canted over to port, the survivors were sitting or lying
on the starboard bulwark. A reward of &pound;500, it was
reported, had been offered by one gentleman to any person who
would bring a single individual from the wreck alive. Such were
some of the gloomy and disheartening tidings of the day.</p>
<p>Friday brought news of gallant but unsuccessful attempts by
shore boats and the Portland lifeboat to reach the wreck, but the
sea was running mountains high, and the brave men gave up their
efforts in despair, not, however, until serious injury had been
done to some of their number. As the telegrams brought
information of their vigorous but unsuccessful attempts, it
seemed to the anxious inquirers at Adelaide that all human help
was in vain, and when some one proposed a special prayer-meeting,
crowds left the telegraph office and proceeded to the Wesley an
chapel in Pirie Street.</p>
<p>On Saturday there was very little news; hope deferred had made
the heart of the people sick, but they wandered about the
streets, hardly losing sight of the telegraph office until
evening, when the following telegram was posted up:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Glorious news! Twenty-two saved, including Rochfort, Hurtle
Fisher, Captain McEwan, Andrew Fuller, and Thomas Davey. Other
names not known. Nineteen gone on to Portland in the
<i>Ladybird</i>. Three on shore. The nineteen were rescued by the
lifeboat of the <i>Ladybird</i>, and the three by the Port
lifeboat in charge of Germain. These taken off the wreck at eight
o'clock this morning. . Poor George Fisher drowned. Sufferers all
much exhausted. . . ."</p>
<p>Further particulars came at intervals, and on Monday the first
mate was sufficiently recovered to give full details, which were
at once wired to Adelaide.</p>
<p>Thus ended a week of the most intense interest, anxiety, and
suspense ever experienced in South Australia. By the calamity at
least eighty lives were lost, under the most heart-rending
circumstances. Large subscriptions were raised for the rescuers
(over &pound;3000), and also for those of the sufferers who
needed help, and medals were awarded to those who had
conspicuously distinguished themselves for bravery.</p>
<br>
<p>On the 1st of March, 1860, the first South Australian
Parliament was dissolved by proclamation. When the writs for the
new elections were issued, the Political Association set to work
in right good earnest to secure the return of members who should
make South Australia the paradise of working men.</p>
<p>The elections took place on the 13th of March, with the result
that many important changes were made in the new Parliament,
insomuch that the <i>Register</i> thus defined the position: "We
cannot enter into any analysis of party gains and losses, for the
very cogent reason that we have had no defined parties.** The old
titles Whigs and Tories never had significance here, and even the
terms Liberal and Conservative fail to convey any definite
meaning. Here, we who wish to maintain the democratic
institutions we have established are to all intents and purposes
Conservatives, while the party whose political bias would in
Britain be deemed Conservative are, in the very nature of things,
Destructives here. The great majority of the people of South
Australia are Democratic-Conservatives, and the minority consists
of two factions having nothing in common but their opposition to
the majority."</p>
<p class="foot">[** "Parties are divided upon particular
subjects. There is a squatting party and an anti-squatting party;
a Government House party, and a party opposed to Government
House; a religious endowment party and a party unfavourable to
religious endowments; but as to well-defined lines of political
demarcation, you might as well look for ink-spots in the moon.
This want of party organization has produced a chronic state of
ministerial instability. In the nine years of responsible
government in South Australia, there have been fifteen absolute
changes of Ministry, besides several changes in individual
offices. In order to save the country from the expense of
frequent elections in the event of ministerial crises, and to
facilitate a speedy readjustment of the Government machinery, it
was provided that a member accepting a responsible office should
not be required to go back to his constituents."&mdash;A.
Forster, 1866.]</p>
<p>The second Parliament of South Australia assembled on the 27th
of April, 1860.*** The Governor stated, among other things, that,
the volunteer force being sufficiently strong, the militia would
not be called out at present, although steps had been taken to
have it in readiness. The number of destitute poor had
diminished, and there were not at that time any able-bodied
labourers dependent on the Government for employment.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** The days of meeting for the Council were
three in each week, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday; for the
House of Assembly four, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday;
the time of meeting for the House of Assembly being half-past
one.]</p>
<p>Before the reply to the Governor's opening address had passed
the House of Assembly, a serious change in the Ministry was
announced, originated by the resignation of Mr. Finniss as
Treasurer. Other changes followed. The Hanson Cabinet went out,
and Mr. T. Reynolds took the reins.</p>
<p>As every young man has his escapades of one sort or another,
and has to learn wisdom by experience, so it is with young
Governments. South Australia was feeling its way, and it had a
number of excellent men pressing to the front, anxious to do good
in their time, and to leave their names inscribed on the scroll
of fame. But no new man could then come to the front in political
life unless he could introduce a bigger programme than his
predecessor, and this is the one Mr. Reynolds set before the
country:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Retrenchment, the principal part of the policy of the new
Ministry;</p>
<p>(2) Repeal of the <i>ad valorem</i> duties;</p>
<p>(3) Abolition of harbour and light dues, and remodelling of
pilot service;</p>
<p>(4) Amalgamation of Harbour Trust, Trinity Board, and Local
Marine Board into one body, to be called the Marine Board;</p>
<p>(5) Establishment of circuit courts;</p>
<p>(6) Opening up of Northern Country for profitable
occupation;</p>
<p>(7) Such alterations in the mode of disposing of the Crown
lands as may be necessitated by the legislation of the
neighbouring colonies;</p>
<p>(8) Placing the salaries of all members of boards on the
estimates, so as to bring all official expenditure under the
control of the Assembly;</p>
<p>(9) Reform of the Civil List for the purpose of
retrenchment;</p>
<p>(10) Reform of the Constitution Act by substituting some lay
officer in the Cabinet for the professional one of
Attorney-General;</p>
<p>(11) Amendment of the Real Property Act in accordance with the
views of the Registrar-General, Lands Titles Commissioners, and
their solicitors;</p>
<p>And eight other items equally sweeping and radical.</p>
<p>With such a programme as this a long sitting of Parliament was
inevitable. At all events, from the composition of the new House,
the Ministry saw that the way was clear for many and great
reforms, and the old party that had, comparatively, so long
administered the affairs of the colony, knew by the result of the
elections that the constituencies had determined to secure, if
possible, some radical changes.</p>
<p>The Ministry was decidedly popular, and the two Houses worked
together much more harmoniously than could have been expected.
Moreover, the personal composition of the Parliament at the close
of the session was precisely the same as at the
commencement&mdash;a rare circumstance in those days. It
indicated a fixity and settlement in the political condition of
the province, and showed that the constituencies had not, after
all, made an unwise selection of men to represent them.</p>
<br>
<p>In following the story of the settlers we have to some extent
lost sight of the aborigines, and we must now go back in their
history to the time when Archdeacon Hale conceived an idea which,
more than any other previously advanced, seemed to meet the need
of the natives. The great difficulty had always been to check
their vagrant habits, and to overcome this evil the Archdeacon
resolved to attempt the establishment of a native institution in
some locality as far removed as possible from the centres of
European population, and also at a distance from the usual haunts
of the aborigines. By thus isolating the children of the natives
and forming them into a little colony he concluded that a mutual
attachment would grow up between the sexes, and in course of
time, after acquiring a moderate amount of education, combined
with a knowledge of husbandry and of some of the most useful
trades, they would marry and continue to practise the civilized
habits they had acquired.</p>
<p>In May, 1850, the plans of Archdeacon Hale were sufficiently
matured to enable him to commence operations. The spot selected
for his praiseworthy and self-denying experiment was Boston
Island, about three and a half miles in length, of the average
breadth of one and a half miles, and stretching along the eastern
side of Boston Bay, thus partly forming the harbour of Port
Lincoln, from which township it was about four miles distant.</p>
<p>The party at first consisted of eleven persons; eight natives
(four of each sex), the Archdeacon, Mr. Minchin, and Mr. Rayner.
The only accommodation they had was a tent for the females and
another for the stores, and for the rest a breakwind of wattle
branches and the canopy of heaven for a roof.</p>
<p>"Our object in choosing this locality," said the Archdeacon,
"was principally seclusion, that we might be cut off from the
society of blacks living in a wild state, and protected from the
unwelcome intrusion of evil-minded persons amongst the whites.
These advantages we set against the formidable disadvantage that
no permanent fresh water had as yet been found upon the
island."</p>
<p>After a fruitless search for water the island was abandoned,
and Poonindie, on the mainland in Louth Bay, near the river Tod,
was selected as the site for future operations. Mere the
Archdeacon and his party forthwith reared three substantial stone
houses and nine log huts; a block of about three thousand acres
of surveyed land was rented for the institution, and by
purchasing the sheep depasturing on the surrounding runs the use
of about twelve square miles was acquired as a run. In a few
months the settlement was formed, many acres were cleared,
fenced, and sown, and wells were dug. In all these operations the
natives assisted, being paid at the rate of sixpence a day, which
it is said they never squandered, but expended in clothes for
themselves, or articles for their houses. In process of time the
native school at North Terrace was discontinued, about fifty
children being drafted from thence to Poonindie. There a
capacious chapel and schoolroom were erected, and additional huts
were reared for married couples, of whom there were as many as
seven or eight.</p>
<p>The institution grew and flourished, and so long as the
Archdeacon had the superintendence of it the expenses of
management were kept under by the services rendered by the
natives.</p>
<p>In 1856 the appointment of Archdeacon Hale to the bishopric of
Perth necessitated his giving up the charge of the institute, and
Dr. Octavius Hammond became his successor. When the Archdeacon
resigned there were sixty individuals maintained and under
instruction, but within the subsequent fifteen months no fewer
than twenty were removed by death, and a period of depression and
anxiety set in.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 1858, the "Aborigines' Friends Association" was
formed, and the Hon. G.F. Angas was appointed its first
president. The object of the association was "the moral,
spiritual, and physical well-being of the natives of this
province." Under the auspices of this association the Point
MacLeay Institution for Natives was inaugurated, Mr. G. Taplin
being the superintendent. For the first few years it was
tolerably well supported by contributions from the Government
towards food and clothing, and partly by private contributions.
Then came a falling off, due in great measure to the sad fact,
applying equally to the Poonindie Institute, that there was a
great mortality amongst the native inmates, and the inference
could not be overlooked that the confinement of the schools, and
the comparatively close application of the mind to study, had a
prejudicial effect upon the health of these children of the
bush.</p>
<p>In 1860 a Select Committee of the Legislative Council was
appointed, of which Mr. G.F. Angas was a member, "to inquire into
the appropriation of the funds set aside from time to time for
the use and benefit of the aborigines, and to suggest such
measures as were likely to tend to the future and permanent
benefit of the natives and the community at large"&mdash;a broad
subject, but it was taken up heartily, especially by Mr. Angas,
who had been among the first to care for these poor
creatures.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* It will be remembered that the first
systematic attempt to instruct the natives was made by Messrs.
C.G. Teichelmann and W.C. Sch&uuml;rmann, who were sent out from
the Lutheran Missionary Society at Dresden, under the auspices
and mainly at the expense of Mr. G.F. Angas.]</p>
<p>The recommendations of the committee were excellent, but, in
view of the fact that every previous effort to permanently
benefit the natives had ended more or less in failure, the
prospect of these recommendations being carried out was more than
doubtful. Even Mr. Angas, who from the first had been more
hopeful than any one for the future of the natives, and had been
probably the largest contributor to agencies working for their
good, was forced to arrive at the following
conclusions:&mdash;"The committee submit as their strong
conviction that permanent benefit to any appreciable extent from
attempts to Christianize the natives can only be expected by
separation of children from their parents and from the evil
influences of the tribe to which they belong. However harshly
this recommendation may grate on the feelings of
pseudo-philanthropists, it would in reality be a work of mercy to
the rising generation of aborigines." The report concluded with
the old sad story: "All the evidence goes to prove that they have
lost much and gained little or nothing by their contact with
Europeans, and hence it becomes a question how far it is in our
power, or what is the best possible means of compensating them
for the injuries they have sustained, or of mitigating the evils
to which, so far as they are concerned, our forced occupation of
their country has led."</p>
<p>Among the causes of their rapid decrease in number the
following were specified:&mdash;(1) From infanticide to a limited
extent. (2) From certain rites performed upon young men impairing
their physical powers. (3) From the introduction among them by
Europeans of more aggravated forms of disease than were known to
exist prior to our occupation of the country. (4) From the
introduction and use of intoxicating liquors, a habit which is
prevalent to excess among the natives, who, despite existing laws
to the contrary, are frequently aided by Europeans in obtaining
supplies. (5) From the disproportion of the sexes.</p>
<p>Some idea of the ratio of decrease may be gained from the fact
that within an area of 2800 miles, the population, which in 1841
numbered 650, was in 1856 only 180.</p>
<p>The first and only reliable census of the aboriginal
population was taken in 1861, when it was found that there were
2375 males of all ages, and 2022 females, or a grand total of
4397.</p>
<p>For several years it was a custom to assemble the natives at
Adelaide on the anniversary of the Queen's birthday, and give
them a feast. It was inaugurated by Governor Gawler, who gave
them the good old English fare of roast beef and plum pudding,
and he was long remembered by the aborigines as "bery good
Gubner", who gave them "plenty tuck out." Blankets were also
given on these occasions to the aged and infirm. In the first
year, 1841, only 283 persons assembled, but the numbers gradually
increased, till in 1845 about nine hundred presented themselves.
This was inconvenient, more especially as quarrelling and
fighting generally ensued, and therefore the plan of distributing
the Queen's bounty in the native settlements was adopted. But the
numbers in attendance fell year by year, and in 1856 the custom
was discontinued. Alas, and the pity of it! the day was fast
approaching when there would be no aborigines left to
assemble.</p>
<p>Although the natives of Australia were not comparable in
intelligence to the Maoris of New Zealand, they were not the
degraded set of human animals that some writers have described.
They had in them the germs of better things, and in proportion as
they were educated, the better qualities came into play. Among
these was generosity and a keen sense of humour&mdash;phases of
character not generally ascribed to them. An illustration of both
these points may be given in an anecdote of the experience of the
Rev.&mdash;Reid, a zealous clergyman, bent on Christianizing the
natives on the Coorong, and who literally died in their service,
as he was capsized in his two-masted open boat when on a mission
to them, and was drowned. On one occasion he found some of these
Coorong natives cooking mullet. As they were about to eat, Mr.
Reid, wishing to improve the occasion, said, "Who gave you that
fish?" "Me catch'm", was the answer. "No," said the pious
minister, "God gave you that fish. God gives black fellow
everything." The natives gave some quick, merry glances, and went
on with their meal. Towards the end, as there was food in plenty
and Mr. Reid was hungry, he said, "You give me some fish." At
once the answer came, "What for me give you fish? You ask'm God;
Him give you plenty." Whereupon there was a roar of laughter;
but, nevertheless, two or three fish were at once thrust into the
clergyman's hands.</p>
<br>
<p>During the administration of Sir Richard MacDonnell, many
important explorations-and discoveries were made and public works
undertaken, which deserve more than a passing notice here. Let us
glance at a few of these events in detail.</p>
<p>On closing the session of the Legislative Council in June,
1856, the Governor alluded to a project for connecting by rail
the capital of the colony with the Murray&mdash;that great river
which traverses with its navigable stream of two thousand miles
the three extensive British colonies of New South Wales,
Victoria, and South Australia, receiving tributaries which in
their turn traverse many hundred miles of valuable country, and
afford the cheapest and best of all carriage where obtainable in
a new country&mdash;namely, internal water carriage.</p>
<p>In strong and vigorous language, the Governor briefly
foreshadowed a scheme for carrying into effect his pet idea. But
public opinion was not so strongly in favour of the great Murray
Railway scheme as he was. The public did not relish the idea of
the enormous debt it was proposed to incur, nor were they
unanimous in considering the undertaking even desirable. By many
the Goolwa and Port Elliot tramway connecting the Murray with the
seaboard was considered amply sufficient for the purposes of
traffic, while others recognized the importance of saving time
and distance by direct railway communication between the upper
waters of the river and the capital. The question was also one of
rival northern and southern interests, as the railway in the
north would, to some extent, affect the trade at the Goolwa end
of the southern districts; and so, for a time, the matter was
allowed to lapse. Meanwhile, about the middle of August, 1856,
Sir Richard MacDonnell, accompanied by Lady MacDonnell, the
Private Secretary, Surveyor-General, and Mr. Younghusband,
started for a trip up the Murray. They proceeded to Moorundie,
and there embarked in the steamer <i>Melbourne</i>, having the
barge <em>Eureka</em> alongside with a cargo of 160 tons,
intended principally for Albury. The <i>Melbourne</i> left
Moorundie on the 25th of August, and on the 25th of September the
party disembarked for the purpose of visiting Beechworth. Here,
as at all other places visited, the Governor was kindly welcomed
with every mark of respect. On the 30th they left Beechworth and
returned to Goolwa by way of Albury, the distance between these
two places being estimated at eighteen hundred miles. The party
returned to Adelaide on the 23rd of October, after an absence of
over two months. The trip was taken for the purpose of personally
inspecting the capabilities of this great river for traffic and
commerce; but, of course, it did not add much to the sum of
geographical knowledge. It was, however, only one of many
journeys taken by the Governor, who was so excellent a traveller
as to entitle him to a place among the explorers of South
Australia.</p>
<p>From 1857 onwards, a series of explorations was undertaken by
the South Australian Government, and nearly all of them were in
the direction where Eyre and Sturt had previously travelled. But
what was then called Lake Torrens presented for a long time an
impenetrable barrier to the exploration of the northern interior;
nevertheless, as we shall see, each successive attempt helped to
make the great discovery of Mr. J.M. Stuart possible.</p>
<p>In 1856 the Legislative Council voted the sum of &pound;1000
to aid in a search for gold, and Mr. B.H. Babbage, Government
geologist, who was entrusted with the command of the expedition,
set forth northwards in September. He did not find gold, but not
far from Eyre's Mount Hopeless he discovered an extensive creek,
which he named MacDonnell, after the Governor, and a fresh-water
lake, which he named Blanchewater, in honour of Lady MacDonnell.
The country thus discovered was visited in 1857 by Mr. G.W.
Goyder, Deputy Surveyor-General, who was sent out to establish a
trigonometrical survey of the neighbourhood. Mr. Goyder reported
the discovery of a magnificent and extensive fresh-water lake and
a creek, to which he gave the name of Freeling. To follow up this
discovery, Captain Freeling, the Surveyor-General, organized a
party, and left Adelaide in July by steamer for Port Augusta, and
reached the scene of Goyder's supposed discoveries. But,
unfortunately, he was not able to confirm Mr. Goyder's report; on
the contrary, he wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I much regret that what there is to relate is decidedly
unfavourable to the extension of discoveries in the direction
mentioned, and by the means proposed. The extensive bays
described in Mr. Goyder's report, the bluff headlands, the
several islands towards the north and south shores, the
vegetation covering them, and their perpendicular cliffs have all
teen the result of mirage, and do not in point of fact exist as
represented." One of Mr. Goyder's party, who accompanied Captain
Freeling, stated that the water had receded half a mile since his
former visit. The captain and some of the party waded into the
mud for a considerable distance, and at the farthest point
reached, he described the view as desolate in the extreme, the
same shallow waters, low islands, and mud extending round three
parts of the horizon. So ended a fruitless journey.</p>
<p>In 1856 Mr. B.H. Babbage made certain proposals to the
Commissioner of Crown Lands with reference to the outfit of an
expedition to explore Lake Torrens more thoroughly, and, after
crossing it at a certain point, to proceed to the north-west as
far as possible. The Government, with the sanction of Parliament,
was entrusted with the necessary outfit; Mr. Babbage was
appointed leader of the party, and Mr. Harris, of the Survey
Office, second in command. In February, 1857, the expedition set
forth, the route being through the districts occupied by the most
distant sheep and cattle stations, from whence the movements of
the explorers were reported&mdash;disadvantageously, for Mr.
Babbage seemed loth to take a plunge into the wilderness, and the
delay called forth such dissatisfaction from the people that it
became the subject of inquiry in Parliament, and eventually of
his recall. Major Warburton, Commissioner of Police, being
appointed in his place. But the whole expedition did not result
in any appreciable advantage to the colony, and ended in
disappointment to all concerned, as well as with an expenditure
of &pound;5552.</p>
<p>One painful discovery made by Mr. Babbage was that of the dead
body of a gallant explorer. Messrs. W. Coulthard, Brooks, and
Scott had gone forth on an expedition in search of a good sheep
country, and when north of Port Augusta announced to some
returning travellers their intention to push forward in the
direction of the Pernatty Lagoon. They were warned of the extreme
hazard of the undertaking, owing to the intense heat and lack of
water, but, disregarding the caution, they went their way. When
searching for water, Coulthard got separated from his companions
and was lost in the bush. Every possible search was made by
Messrs. Brooks and Scott, but without avail, and no one ever saw
him again alive. But Mr. Babbage accidentally found his remains,
and near to the body a shepherd's tin canteen, on which was
scratched one of the saddest records ever penned. It was as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I never reached water. I do not know how long it is since it
is that I left Scott and Brooks, but I think it Monday, bleeding
Pomp to leive on his blood. I took his black horse to look for
water and the last thing I can rember is puling the saddle off
him and letting him go        until now is not good        long
it may be wether 2 or 3 days I do not know        I am not
shure        My Tung is stiking to my mouth and I see what I have
rote and know this is the last time I may have of expressing
feeling Blind (?) altho feeling exce        for want of
water        My ey Dazels my tong burn        I can see no way
God help&mdash;&mdash;."</p>
<p>The earlier words were firmly and clearly marked, but towards
the end they became almost illegible scratches, made, it is
evident, when the poor fellow, blind and half mad, was in the
agony of death. To add to the sadness of the story, it was found
that within half a mile of the bush where Coulthard lay down to
die, there was a waterhole with an abundant supply of water.</p>
<p>About this time (1857-8), a number of explorations were
originated. Mr. Stephen Hack, accompanied by Mr. Harris of the
Survey Department, tried to penetrate to the north-west, but was
unable to pass the dense scrub. A private party, consisting of
Messrs. D. Thomson, M. Campbell, and C. Swinden, started from the
head of Spencer's Gulf for a trip northwards, and came upon the
large lagoon called by the natives Pernatty, two remarkable hills
(Bonney's Bluff and Bottle Hill), and a creek which they named
the Elizabeth. They were only away for a few days, as they had
not much provision with them; but their discoveries were
important, although it afterwards transpired that some of the
country had previously been examined.</p>
<p>Of the two expeditions under Major Warburton, the Commissioner
of Police, the one in which he was sent to recall Mr. Babbage was
most fruitful in results. On his return journey he conceived the
idea of crossing the supposed bed of Lake Torrens, and reaching
the settled districts by this entirely new route. The passage was
a complete success, for instead of having to wade through water,
or plunge through mud, as indicated in the maps then extant, the
major found good dry land, and no obstacles other than those
ordinarily met with in new and untrodden paths.</p>
<p>Later, Major Warburton and Mr. Samuel Davenport examined some
of the country from Streaky Bay to Lake Gairdner, as well as the
Gawler Range district, but no striking discoveries were made.</p>
<p>Two expeditions made by the Governor, Sir Richard MacDonnell,
in the year 1859 deserve some notice here. Of the first he gave
an account to the Hon. G.F. Angas, who was at that time on a
visit to England, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="right"><small>"Nepean Bay, Kangaroo Island, Feb. 17,
1859.</small>   </p>
<p>"I am just returned from a very rapid and successful exploring
expedition up the Darling in Cadell's steamer, the <i>Albury</i>.
I regard all these expeditions as an extension of this colony's
commercial boundary, which, after all, is its real boundary for
many important purposes. It will interest you to learn that I
only left Adelaide on the 23rd ult. (January), and having
embarked at Blanche Town on board of the <i>Albury</i> after a
ride of seventy miles (vi&acirc; Angaston) from Gawler through a
fierce hot wind, I reached the junction on the 26th and slept on
Mount Murchison, 290 miles by land and 600 by water from the
junction, on the 5th instant, whilst I now write to you from
Kangaroo Island on the 17th, having between the 23rd ult. and
this morning steamed on Australian rivers nearly 2400 miles, and
ridden about 200.</p>
<p>"I have just been telling Sturt how smoothly I have been
gliding through scenes of his hardships and disasters. We are
certainly progressing, as you may judge when I tell you that an
order dated from Sydney the 23rd of January to deliver four tons
of goods at a station 400 miles up the Darling, was executed on
the 3rd of February, only eleven days after the order was given
at Sydney. . . ."</p>
<p>The Governor's second journey was made in October of the same
year, for the purpose of seeing the discoveries of Sturt,
Babbage, and Warburton in the north. The farthest point reached
was a range of hills which he named the Denison Range in honour
of the Governor-General. Sir Richard was absent for nearly three
months, and during that time he rode on horseback 1800 miles,
endured the hardships of heat and thirst common to explorers, and
proved himself to be an excellent bushman.</p>
<p>But all the explorations of this period, valuable as they
were, pale into insignificance beside those of John McDouall
Stuart, South Australia's greatest explorer. His achievements
have been so often and so fully told in detail, that it will not
be necessary to give more than the barest outline here.</p>
<p>In April, 1859, Mr. Stuart, the draughtsman of Captain Sturt's
expedition, went out northwards and travelled through the
Pernatty country in search of pastoral runs for Messrs. Chambers
and Finke. He was accompanied by Mr. Kekwick and one attendant,
and was provided with nine horses. On the 17th of July Stuart
returned to Adelaide, and reported that he had succeeded in
reaching the then northern boundary of the colony in about
latitude 26&deg; south, and that the country traversed consisted
mostly of immense plains interspersed with numerous hillocks,
from the summit of which springs of water gushed out. Ranges,
rivers, and creeks were also met with by this small and intrepid
party; in short, a most fertile and interesting tract of country
was reported to exist where it was previously supposed that only
scrub, sand, and saline lakes were to be found. To complete the
glowing picture it was rumoured that an auriferous country had
also been discovered. This rumour was re-echoed some time
afterwards by the Royal Geographical Society, to whom some
particulars of the expedition, not known elsewhere, were
communicated. So highly did the Society appreciate Stuart's
labours that they awarded him a handsome gold watch.</p>
<p>When Stuart returned to Adelaide Parliament was in session,
and in order to encourage him, or some other explorer, to cross
the continent and reach the northern coast a sum of &pound;2000
was voted as a reward for the accomplishment of this feat. Mr. A.
Tolmer was the first competitor, but before he had got beyond the
reach of the settled districts, owing to difficulties with the
horses and dissensions among his men, he gave up the attempt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Stuart, with the assistance of Messrs. Chambers and
Finke, quietly and unostentatiously made his arrangements for
penetrating as far as possible into the northern interior. As he
preferred travelling by land rather than sea, he applied for a
vessel to be sent to the northern coast for the purpose of taking
supplies, and of bringing him and his party back in the event of
their reaching the other side of the continent. Very little was
known of his movements except that he had started with a small
expedition for the interior.</p>
<p>About this time, that is to say in August, 1860, the Victorian
Government, stimulated by the action of South Australia, sent
forth an expedition, with the same object in view, under the
command of Robert O'Hara Burke, with whom was associated Mr. W.J.
Wills and others.</p>
<p>On the 7th of October Mr. Stuart and his two companions
returned to Adelaide. In consequence of scarcity of water, the
hostility of natives, and the smallness and weakness of their
party, the attempt to cross the continent had been unsuccessful.
Nevertheless the results of the expedition were of exceptional
interest. Its promoters, Messrs. Chambers and Finke, in placing
Mr. Stuart's journal in the hands of the Government, stipulated
that it should not be published for a certain period, so that the
benefit of the discoveries made should be secured to Mr. Stuart,
who was ready to continue his task when opportunity should offer.
The publication was deferred until, in a further attempt to cross
the continent, Mr. Stuart had arrived outwards as far as
Chambers' Creek. No sooner was this valuable document issued than
a special messenger was despatched by the Victorians to place Mr.
Burke in possession of the information gained by Stuart in the
interior, but scarcity of water prevented the messenger from
accomplishing his task.</p>
<p>From Stuart's journal it appeared that he left Chambers' Creek
on the 2nd of March, and on the 22nd of April reached the centre
of the continent, where, on a high mound which he named Central
Mount Stuart, he built a cairn of stones, and planted the British
flag upon it. On the 26th of June, on reaching a large creek, the
party were attacked by a number of powerful natives, and it was
found necessary to beat a retreat as soon as possible. Some of
his hairbreadth escapes, and the motives which induced him to
abandon his cherished object, are given in a letter to Mr.
Chambers, from which we quote:&mdash;</p>
<p>"After making the centre I was assailed by that dreadful
disease, the scurvy, which completely prostrated me and rendered
me quite helpless. Still I persevered, and endeavoured to reach
the mouth of the Victoria river on a north-west course, but was
obliged to relinquish the attempt three separate times through
the want of water. . . .</p>
<p>"I was now forced to go back to the centre. Three miles to the
north of the centre is a high hill, on which I planted the flag,
and named it Central Mount Stuart. From this I could see ranges
to the north-east, which gave me a better idea of the country for
water, and I thought I might get an opening that would lead me to
the north-west of Gum and Spinifex Plain. I therefore proceeded
in that direction to latitude 19&deg; 22', longitude 134&deg;
18'. From this I again made another attempt to make the Victoria
on a north-west course, but again I was obliged to retreat from
the want of water. We were one hundred and eleven hours, without
a drop of water under a burning hot sun and heavy sandy soil to
travel on. After this journey I gave up all hope of making the
Victoria, and tried for the Gulf of Carpentaria."</p>
<p>But in this attempt dangers, difficulties, and insuperable
obstacles beset him at every turn, and finally there was a
desperate encounter with the natives.</p>
<p>"I took into consideration," Stuart adds, "the position in
which I was then placed&mdash;my horses tired and weary, three of
them unable to be longer than one night without water; the men
complaining six weeks before this of being so weak from want of
sufficient food that they were unable to perform their
duty&mdash;their movements were more those of men of a hundred
years old than of young men of twenty-five&mdash;and myself being
so unwell that I was unable to sit in the saddle the whole day
without suffering the most excruciating pain; our provisions
scarcely sufficient to carry us back, and now being in the midst
of hostile natives who were wily, bold, and daring, so much so
that I could see at once that my party would be unable to cope
with them, although we gained the advantage at first. . . ."</p>
<p>These were among the amply sufficient reasons which induced
Mr. J.M. Stuart to return, and it was fortunate he did so at
once, for on his journey back he found many of the water-holes
dry, which he calculated would have lasted much longer.</p>
<p>The furthest point reached on this journey was about the
nineteenth degree of south latitude, or about 1300 miles from
Adelaide in a straight line, and about 300 miles from the
north-west coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria.</p>
<p>The fact of this extraordinary feat having been accomplished
was doubted by many, and even denied by one writer in Victoria,
but the publication of the letter, from which we have quoted
above, silenced alike the doubters and deniers.</p>
<p>On the return of his party to Adelaide, a great demonstration
was made in honour of the intrepid explorers, and the Government
voted the sum of &pound;2500 to lit out an expedition to enable
Mr. Stuart to make another attempt to accomplish the feat of
crossing the continent.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of November, 1860, Mr. Stuart left Adelaide to
follow up his adventurous task. He was accompanied by Mr.
Kekwick, as second in command, F.W. Thring, third officer, and a
brave following, namely, E.E. Bayliffe, J.H. Ewart, B. Head, A.J.
Lawrence, W. Masters, J.A. Thomas, D. Thompson, J. Wall, and J.
Woodforde. On the 1st of January, 1861, they started from
Chambers' Creek, and nothing more was heard of them until about
the middle of September. Then came the startling report that the
party had actually crossed the continent. But rumour lied, and
from subsequent intelligence it was found that although they had
reached the latitude of the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria, they
had not succeeded in getting to the seacoast on the other side of
the continent. After penetrating some considerable distance
beyond the point previously reached, the first great difficulty
arose from meeting with some large plains, which he named Sturt's
Plains, after the great Australian explorer. Stuart concluded
that these plains had been at one time the bed of a large
fresh-water lake; they were covered with luxuriant grass, in many
places above the horses'' knees, but the ground was very rotten
and difficult to travel over. The plains were skirted by an
impenetrable scrub and dense forest, which completely arrested
further progress, although gallant attempts were made in all
directions. In the neighbourhood of the plains, however, a
splendid sheet of water was found, 150 yards wide, nine miles
long, and seventeen feet deep in the middle. This valuable
discovery&mdash;named Newcastle Waters in honour of the Secretary
of State&mdash;raised the hope that, after all, the progress of
the party would be possible; but at the end of nine miles the
deep water was succeeded by a chain of ponds, and beyond, scrub
and forest even denser than those that had before driven them
back. Again and again they tried to force their way, but it was
hopeless, and on the 11th of June Stuart wrote as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="right"><small>"Tomkinson's Creek.</small>   </p>
<p>"Shoeing horses and repairing saddles and bags to carry our
provisions back. We have now run out of everything for that
purpose. We are all nearly naked; the scrub has been so severe on
our clothes, one can hardly tell the original colour of a single
garment&mdash;they are so patched; our boots are also gone. It is
with great reluctance I am forced to return without a further
trial. I should like to go back and try from Newcastle Waters,
but my provisions will not allow me. I started with thirty weeks'
supply, at seven pounds of flour per week, and have now been out
twenty-six, and it will take me ten weeks before I can reach the
first station. The men are also failing and showing the effects
of short rations. I only wish I had sufficient to carry me on
until the rain will fall in next March. I think I would be able
to make both the Victoria and the Gulf. . . ."</p>
<br>
<p>Although considerable disappointment was felt and expressed by
the colonists when it became known that Stuart had again failed
to cross the continent, a warm reception was given to him and his
brave companions, and even before the whole of the party arrived
in Adelaide, steps were taken by the Government to once more send
Stuart out with a party well equipped in every particular.</p>
<p>In all the explorations up to this time Sir Richard MacDonnell
had taken the most profound interest, and had given the most
cordial assistance. It was a matter of the deepest regret to him,
as it was to the colonists generally, that the term of his
administration ceased before the party, reorganized and sent out
in the beginning of December, 1861, returned crowned with
victory. We shall defer the narration of Stuart's final
exploration, therefore, until we come to the story of the
administration of Sir Richard's successor.</p>
<br>
<p>Between 1859 and 1861 important mining discoveries were made,
which had an altogether exceptional influence upon the material
advancement of the province. As early as the year 1847 minerals
were known to be in existence on Yorke's Peninsula, although no
one was aware of their richness or extent, and it was not until
1861 that the two great mines in this locality, the Wallaroo and
Moonta mines, attracted public attention. Singular to relate,
both these mines, as in the case of the renowned Burra-Burra and
others, were discovered by shepherds. It was in December, 1859,
that a shepherd named James Boor, in the employment of Mr.
(afterwards Sir) Walter Watson Hughes, picked up some specimens
on the sheep run where he followed his flock, and these, upon
analysis, proved to be rich in copper. In February, 1860, lour
Cornish miners appeared upon the scene, and the result of their
labours led to a speedy increase of hands and the extensive
application of machinery. Mineral leases of the land were
immediately secured, a company was formed, and success set in.
The richness of the Wallaroo Mine may be judged from the
following figures: "The ore raised between March, 1860, and
December, 1884, amounted to 428,333 tons gross weight, of a net
value of &pound;1,970,533, and represented a production of copper
of 41,025 tons, of an estimated net value in the colony of
&pound;2,873,121. The mine gave employment, when in full work, to
a very large staff, there being at one time as many as 1003 men
and boys engaged in the workings." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** "South Australia", by John Fairfax
Conigrave.]</p>
<p>Splendid as these results were, they were eclipsed by those of
the Moonta Mine, discovered in May, 1861, by a shepherd named
Evan, also in the employment of Mr. W.W. Hughes. The claim of
Evan was disputed by Mr. E.E. Mitford, the editor of
<i>Pasquin</i>, a clever satirical writer, who alleged that he
had made the discovery as early as 1848, but had not taken any
steps until public attention was turned to the Peninsula as a
mining district. Mr. Mitford endeavoured to establish his claim,
first through the Crown Lands Department, and next by petition to
Parliament, where a Select Committee decided against him.</p>
<p>When the shepherd Ryan made the discovery of a valuable
deposit of copper ore at no great distance from his hut, and,
like the Wallaroo, only a few miles distant from the sea-coast,
he was in a dilemma. The fact was Ryan was not a teetotaller,
but, on the contrary, was rather given to too free indulgence in
"the cup that cheers, but inebriates," and the friend to whom he
first confided the news of his discovery was slow to believe him,
as "lucky finds" had turned the heads of many much more sober
men. It appears that there was some doubt in Ryan's mind whether
he would secure the claim for himself and a partner, or allow his
employer to become the fortunate holder. Whether the latter was
his intention or not will probably never be known, but Mr. Hughes
and his friends got scent of the matter, and lost no time in
lodging a claim for five sections somewhere not very far from the
locality indicated. Meanwhile Ryan took a trip to town and
entered into an agreement with Mr. S. Mills to share with him the
discovery, and Mr. Mills proceeded to the Land Office to lodge a
claim. No sooner were the doors of the Land Office opened than
the rival claimants entered, but the agents of Mr. Hughes being
more expeditious in filling up the forms of application succeeded
in first handing in their claim. To tell the whole story of the
events that followed, and all the circumstances connected with
the Tipara Mineral claims&mdash;as the Moonta sections were then
generally designated&mdash;would fill a moderately sized volume.
The whole matter was finally referred to a Select Committee of
the House of Assembly, appointed in 1863, who asked and elicited
answers to upwards of seven thousand questions. Their report
decided adversely to Mr. Hughes's right to the property, and in
favour of Mr. S. Mills, as the party authorized to lodge the
claims by the legitimate discoverer, Ryan, and this decision of
course invalidated the claims of Mr. Mitford also, so far as the
committee was concerned.</p>
<p>But the report of the Select Committee was not adopted by the
House, the Assembly considering that the case should be relegated
to the limbo of the Law Courts. Mr. Hughes, however, secured
thirty sections in the vicinity of the first discovery, and
twelve of these were subsequently leased to the proprietary. The
property was at first represented by forty shares, some of which
were given away in a most liberal manner, and the whole were
subsequently subdivided. The Moonta Mine soon proved to be more
productive than the famous Wallaroo Mine. "From the opening of
the Moonta Mine in 1861, to the 28th of February, 1885, the total
quantity of ore raised amounted to 447,969 tons (gross weight) of
twenty-one cwts., of a value in the colony of &pound;4,468,124,
representing a total production of refined copper of 85,104 tons,
the value of which to the colony may be approximately stated at
&pound;5,879,226." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* "South Australia", by John Fairfax
Conigrave.]</p>
<p>In 1861, in consequence of further mineral discoveries on the
Peninsula, some hundreds of claims for mineral leases were lodged
at the Crown Lands Office. Mining became a mania; tradesmen and
others left their ordinary occupations to pay a visit to the
Peninsula, nearly all of whom found, or thought they had found,
"good indications". If two or more hit upon a likely spot it
became a race which should first reach the Land Office to lodge
the claim.</p>
<p>Several other mining companies were formed, or "mining
ventures "were entered into, while the mania lasted, the total
capital of those who advertised amounting to about half a million
sterling; but after the expenditure of much money in prospecting,
sinking, and advertising, they were nearly all wound up, leaving
the colonists in general, and the tradesmen in particular, poorer
but wiser men. During the time that the excitement lasted it was
believed that a larger sum was realized by the sale and transfer
of shares than was payable in dividends by all the companies for
a year to come. Those who had resided in the colony during the
mining mania of 1845-46 well knew that, with the exception of the
Burra-Burra Mine, the most profitable period in the history of
all other mines had been while there was sufficient enthusiasm to
raise the shares to a premium, and those "who knew a thing or
two", as the vulgar say, managed to feather their own nests.</p>
<p>The large population attracted to the Peninsula by the
prosperity of the great mines led the Government to lay out two
townships, one at the shipping place, named Wallaroo, and one a
few miles inland, named Kadina. So completely did the mineral
discoveries change the face of the country that in three or four
years the land, which had previously been a mere sheep run,
possessed two flourishing towns with substantial buildings, and a
large population.</p>
<p>One great drawback experienced in both townships, as well as
at the mines, was the want of water, to supply which distillation
was, in the first instance, resorted to, the salt and brackish
water from the mines being used for this purpose. A high price
had to be paid for this unpalatable liquid, and housekeepers and
teetotallers had a poor time of it. All new buildings, therefore,
had the roofs so constructed that they should store every drop of
rain water that fell on them, and this was found to be a great
improvement upon the distilled water.</p>
<p>About this period another very important branch of industry,
destined in the near future to become a staple in the South
Australian market, was coming into prominence. In a letter to Mr.
G.F. Angas, written in 1860, Sir Richard MacDonnell
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have lately been going through the dozen duplicate samples
of wine which you sent me from Tanunda, and at least eight of
them are excellent. I have been quite surprised at their quality,
but I have no doubt this country will be a good wine-producing
country. People are setting to work energetically planting vines
in all directions, and in four years I have no doubt we shall
obtain a tolerable footing in the English market."</p>
<p>The Governor was not far out in his calculation, but it was
not until 1871 that any trade of importance was done with
England. Vines were sent out by the South Australian Company as
early as 1835-36, but the first vineyard proper was planted by
Mr. John Reynell, on his property at Reynella, about twelve miles
from Adelaide, in 1840. "in 1846 Mr. Patrick Auld commenced the
celebrated "Auldana" vineyard. In 1863 the justly famous
"Tintara" vineyard was planted by Dr. Kelly. It must be confessed
that at first Australian wine was sorry stuff, but year by year
planting went steadily on. It was found that soil and climate
were suited to the production of every kind of wine, but more
especially of generous wines of the claret and Burgundy type,
while some, such as the "Highercombe", more resemble Chablis. We
shall have more to say about the marvellous development of the
wine trade of South Australia later on, but it may give an
indication of its enormous growth to state here that in four
months ended the 31st of May, 1890, one firm alone (Messrs. P.B.
Burgoyne &amp; Co.) imported into England 123,658 gallons! A year
or two later than the date of Sir Richard MacDonnell's letter,
from which we have quoted, Mr. Anthony Forster, an old and
experienced colonist, wrote upon the wines and vine culture of
South Australia as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"South Australia has made immense progress in the development
of agricultural, pastoral, and mineral wealth. These are the
three great staples of the country, to which wine may be added as
a fourth. The production of the latter is increasing largely
every year, and promises to become a considerable source of
income to the horticulturist, as well as a protection to the
community against the excessive use of more stimulating
beverages. The wine produced is of a light but excellent
description, well suited to the requirements of a warm climate,
and free from the noxious adulterations so frequently discovered
in imported wines."</p>
<br>
<p>When Parliament was called together on the 20th of April,
1861, the Governor announced, among other things, the receipt of
a despatch from the Duke of Newcastle, stating that her Majesty
would be advised to introduce a Bill into the Imperial Parliament
to give her Majesty power to annex to South Australia the tract
of land lying between the western boundary of South Australia and
the eastern boundary of Western Australia, and also, at some
future time, to extend the colony northward.</p>
<p>During the session the Immigration Question gave rise to a
long and spirited debate, and resulted in the passing of
resolutions in both Houses for the resumption of free
immigration, leaving it to the Ministry to exercise a certain
amount of discretion in the matter.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of December the protracted labours of the session
were brought to an end, and as it was the last occasion on which
the Governor expected to meet the Parliament of South Australia,
he delivered an address of more than ordinary length.</p>
<p>In congratulating the members on the aspect of affairs in the
colony, he said, "If there is less excitement than at some former
periods there is more substantial prosperity and solid
advancement. All classes of the labouring population find ready
and remunerative employment, while, owing to the low prices of
provisions and other necessaries of life, their material comforts
are greater than they have been for many years. Fresh tracts of
country are being continually occupied; new sources of mineral
wealth are being opened up, and Divine Providence has again
favoured us with abundant crops."</p>
<p>He congratulated them on the boon conferred by the Real
Property Act, providing for increased facilities, cheapness, and
simplicity in all dealings with land; on the volunteer movement
and the additional security of the colony; and on general
subjects connected with the administration.</p>
<p>In looking back on the past six years of the history of the
colony&mdash;the period covered by his term of office&mdash;he
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"When I landed here in June, 1855, there was not a mile of
railway opened in the colony; now there are fifty-seven miles in
use, over which annually rolls a traffic of more than 150,000
tons and 320,000 passengers. Your coasts have been lit with three
additional first-class lights, and three additional harbours have
come into extensive use. Your population has grown from 80,000 to
nearly 130,000, whilst the exports of colonial produce have risen
from less than &pound;691,000 in 1855 to &pound;1,808,000 for the
year ending the 30th of June last. When I landed there were
scarcely sixty miles of made road in the colony, whereas now,
independent of those in the city, there are over two hundred
miles; and instead of 160,000 acres only in cultivation, there
cannot be less now than 460,000&mdash;a number greater in
proportion to the population than obtains in any other portion of
her Majesty's dominions, or, indeed, in any other part of the
world with which I am acquainted. It is, moreover, since 1855
that the first telegraph post was erected in this colony, and yet
you already possess 600 miles of telegraph communication, and
nearly 1000 miles of wire, together with twenty-six stations. It
is also since 1855 that the explorations of Mr. Stuart and others
have added so much to our geographical knowledge, filling up the
large blank spaces which had so long defaced the map of South
Australia, and usefully opening up the country to further
settlement. Above all, it is since my arrival here that the great
experiment has been tried of entrusting the general mass of the
people, through their immediate representatives, with power to
control completely the taxation and expenditure of the country
and direct its general legislation."</p>
<p>On the day of prorogation valedictory addresses were presented
from the members of both Houses to the retiring Governor, and
expressions of regret on their part, no less than on his, were
warmly exchanged.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 23rd of December, a large body of German
colonists, having resolved to present a valedictory address to
Sir Richard, formed a torch-light procession, and, preceded by a
band of music, and accompanied by the members of the Liedertafel,
proceeded to Government House. Some thousands assembled to
witness the novel and effective demonstration. Two hundred and
fifty torches were lighted, Bengal lights were burnt, and finally
a bonfire was made of the torches. The address was signed by 1326
German colonists.</p>
<p>The name of Sir Richard MacDonnell will ever remain identified
with the most interesting and most important period of South
Australian history&mdash;the transition of the colony from a
state of comparative dependence to the enjoyment of a
Constitution which, while it imposed an enormous, weighty, and
responsible trust, involving the almost absolute control of all
local interests, at the same time gave an independence which
should endure and carry its blessings with it, through all
time.</p>
<p>So great a favourite was Sir Richard, and so essential to the
welfare of the colony was his presence regarded that a memorial
was drawn up, praying her Majesty to extend his term of service;
but, as Sir Richard pointed out to the leaders of this movement,
he could not forward a document of the kind in which he himself
might be regarded as personally interested, and, moreover, at
that time a despatch had been received from the Duke of
Newcastle, stating that Sir Dominick Daly had been appointed his
successor.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> D<small>OMINICK</small> D<small>ALY</small>
arrived at Port Adelaide early in the morning of March 4, 1862,
so early, in fact, as to disarrange all preconcerted plans for
his reception, and he and his family had to walk to the railway
station. The ceremony of swearing-in took place at Government
House the same day, when Sir Richard MacDonnell, "as a private
individual", delivered a kindly and generous address of
congratulation.</p>
<p>Later in the day the new Governor, accompanied by Sir Richard,
reviewed the volunteer corps (numbering from six hundred to seven
hundred) in the presence of some five or six thousand spectators.
It was rather an anomalous demonstration, as it was originally
designed in honour of Sir Richard, who had taken a lively
interest in the volunteer movement during the whole period of his
administration, and it now had to serve a double purpose&mdash;to
"welcome the coming and speed the parting guest."</p>
<p>It must be admitted that the day of departure of a Governor
who had made himself decidedly and deservedly popular was not the
most appropriate day for the arrival and inauguration of his
successor, but in the circumstances it could not be arranged
otherwise.</p>
<p>Sir Dominick Daly's antecedents were good. In 1822, at the age
of twenty-four, he left Ireland as private secretary to Sir
Francis Burton, who in that year went out as Governor of Lower
Canada. In 1827 Mr. Daly received the appointment of Provincial
Secretary of Lower Canada, and upon the union of Upper and Lower
Canada in 1840 he was promoted to the Secretaryship of the United
Provinces, an office he held until 1848, during which period he
became not only thoroughly acquainted with the routine work of
colonial government, but also with the working out of responsible
government.</p>
<p>Sir J.W. Kaye, the biographer of Lord Metcalfe, who was
Governor of Lower Canada during a portion of this period, says of
Mr. Daly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"He was an Irishman and a Roman Catholic, and although for the
latter reason his sympathies were strongly with the French
people, or had been so long as they were oppressed by the
dominant race, his feelings, the growth of education and early
association, were of a conservative and aristocratic cast. All
Metcalfe's informants represented him to be a man of high honour
and integrity, of polished manners and courteous address&mdash;a
good specimen of an Irish gentleman. It was added that he was
possessed of judgment and prudence, tact and discretion&mdash;in
short, a man to be trusted."</p>
<p>During the four years he was in England he was entrusted with
some important commissions by the Home Government, and in 1852 he
was appointed to his first colonial Governorship, that of Tobago,
one of the Windward Islands. In 1854 he was promoted to the
Government of Prince Edward Island, and occupied that post for
six years. In 1856 he was created a Knight Bachelor, and in 1859
returned to England, where he remained until he received the
appointment of Governor of South Australia.</p>
<p>The time at which Sir Dominick assumed the office of Governor
was one of some anxiety, reports having reached the colony that a
war between England and the United States was not improbable in
consequence of the seizure by a Federal war steamer of two
passengers, Messrs. Slidell and Mason, Confederate commissioners
to England and France, on board the English mail steamer
<i>Trent</i> in the Bahama Channel. How an apology was demanded
by the English Government, and how the United States Government
surrendered the "rebels", thereby averting a war between the two
countries, is matter of well-known history. The "great review",
which signalized the advent of Sir Dominick Daly, occurring in
such war-like times, was an appropriate demonstration. It so
happened, too, that it was the closing terra of the first really
important volunteer movement in the colony&mdash;that is to say,
it brought to an end the three years' service of the first
enrolment of unpaid volunteers. Unfortunately, martial zeal was a
difficult thing to sustain in the colony, and the unpaid
volunteer system fell somewhat into disfavour, although in the
following year a second enrolment was resorted to for a further
period of three years. "In order to continue the renewal of the
services of the trained volunteers they were offered, as an
inducement to sign the new roll, the free gift of the rifles and
accoutrements then in their keeping, but it was felt that the day
was gone by when men would continue to attend drill without some
compensation for loss of time, and this disinclination was shown
in the gradual falling off in the numbers present on field-days."
In 1866, therefore, an Act was passed&mdash;subsequently amended
in many important details&mdash;which made the volunteer military
force a paid body.</p>
<p>The association for rifle practice, originated and warmly
supported by Sir Richard MacDonnell, continued to flourish, and
developed into the "South Australian National Rifle Association",
recognized by the Government and encouraged by a special Act of
Parliament as an Auxiliary Volunteer Military Force.</p>
<p>The question of the defence of the colony was one that was
continually cropping up, and in the days when the unpaid
volunteer force was in full vigour many imaginary invasions took
place, and on several occasions, in order to keep the force in a
state of preparation, a prearranged signal would rouse the
peaceful colonists from their slumbers to go forth in the dead of
night to engage in sanguinary conflict with the supposed
invaders.</p>
<p>Sometimes the volunteers rendered important service and gave
to the colonists a sense of security they would not otherwise
have had. For example: in consequence of the urgent necessity
that existed for the presence of all the available troops
stationed in the Australian colonies to assist in suppressing the
war with the Maories in New Zealand, the detachment of the 40th
Regiment located at Adelaide was allowed, in October, 1863, to
leave the colony for the seat of war.</p>
<p>In April, 1865, a commission, appointed to inquire into the
best means of protecting the coast in the event of invasion, gave
in its report and recommended the procuring from England of ten
or twelve guns of heavy calibre; the erection of batteries at
such points of the coast as would most effectually protect the
ports and townships within range of the enemy's guns from the
sea; the purchase of a complete equipment for a full battery of
rifled field artillery to be manned by a local force; the
maintenance, under strict military discipline, of a paid force of
seven hundred infantry and two hundred artillery; that
encouragement should be given to the colonists to obtain a
knowledge of the use of the rifle and of simple military
movements with a view to their acting as volunteer auxiliaries to
the paid body; and that a supply of the most approved rifles for
at least two thousand men should be procured. Several of these
recommendations were fully carried out.</p>
<p>The absorbing topic in the early days of Sir Dominick Daly's
administration, and more or less throughout that whole period,
was not "rude war's alarms", but the victories of peace,
especially those gained by Australia's great explorers. Mr. J.M.
Stuart had, as we have seen,** gone forth for the fifth time to
attempt the gigantic feat of crossing the continent, and Messrs.
Burke and Wills, under the auspices of the Victorian Government,
had been sent out upon a similar errand. Unhappily the latter
expedition, although successful in being the first to cross the
continent, ended in a terrible tragedy.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See p. 345.]</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1862 there occurred some of the most
exciting incidents in connection with South Australian
exploration. In October information was received that Mr.
McKinlay and his party, who had been despatched on an expedition
with a view to render assistance, if not too late, to the Burke
and Wills party from Victoria, and, if possible, to explore the
neighbourhood of Lake Eyre, had returned by quite an unexpected
route. It appeared that he proceeded direct to Cooper's Creek,
where, from the accounts of the natives and the discovery of what
was supposed to be the body of Gray, one of the missing
explorers, he concluded that the whole of Burke's party had been
murdered, and, accordingly, he sent messengers to Blanchewater
with this painful intelligence. Before their return, however, he
found memorials left by Mr. Howitt, who had been sent out by the
Victorian Government, recording the terrible fate of Burke and
Wills. When McKinlay's messengers returned, they brought fuller
particulars of the tragedy, together with information that the
Victorian Government intended to despatch a party to convey the
remains of the unfortunate explorers to Melbourne. In
endeavouring to carry out his instructions to head Lake Eyre and
return by the western shores of that lake, Mr. McKinlay was
suddenly surrounded by a heavy flood, and was obliged, with his
party, to remain for several days upon a sand-hill. It was with
the greatest difficulty he made his escape, as the country was
one vast sheet of water&mdash;that same country which had but a
short time previously been a desert, dry, and without a sign of
vegetation. The flood waters ran apparently into a basin so wide
and deep that Mr. McKinlay was unable to pass by the head of the
lake as instructed, and this led him so far towards the Gulf of
Carpentaria, that he determined to push on there and obtain a
supply of provisions from the Victorian steamer, sent to that
gulf to assist any party successful in crossing the continent. He
was disappointed in the expectation of obtaining supplies, and
being short of the commonest necessaries, it was imperative that
he should at once take the shortest route to settled districts.
He accordingly made for Port Denison, where he obtained the
needful supplies. Although he had departed from his instructions
in making his bold dash to the northward, he had solved the great
problem, and had succeeded in crossing over to the Gulf of
Carpentaria almost in the footsteps of Burke and Wills.</p>
<p>A handsome public presentation was made to Mr. McKinlay, and
the Legislature also voted the sum of &pound;1000 as an
acknowledgment of his valuable services.</p>
<p>But the idol of the people was, without doubt, John McDouall
Stuart, whose return was awaited with almost feverish anxiety. In
the mean time, however, and as if to bring home to them with
renewed force the hazards and perils of interior exploration,
they were to witness a scene which none who beheld should ever
forget.</p>
<p>In December, 1862, the remains of the missing explorers,
Messrs. Burke and Wills, were brought by Mr. Howitt and his party
to Adelaide, from Cooper's Creek, <i>en route</i> to Melbourne,
from whence these gallant but unfortunate men had started with a
view to cross the continent. The streets of Adelaide were lined
by thousands of sympathetic spectators, who, with uncovered
heads, surrounded by emblems of mourning, and amid the clangour
of tolling bells, viewed the mournful procession as it passed on
its way from the railway station to the barracks. Much respect
was shown to Mr. Howitt, who, in addition to the objects of his
special mission, had made important explorations affecting the
interests of South Australia.</p>
<p>Only a few days after the remains of the daring but
unsuccessful explorers, Burke and Wills, had left Adelaide by
steamer for Melbourne, the gratifying intelligence was received
from the far north that Mr. J.M. Stuart and his party had
returned to the settled districts after successfully crossing and
recrossing the continent. There was not a man in all South
Australia whose heart did not swell with gratitude, pride, and
satisfaction, on receiving this news, and every scrap of
information was eagerly devoured. The party consisted of J.M.
Stuart, W. Kekwick, F.W. Thring, W.P. Auld, S. King, J. Billiatt,
J.F. New, H. Nash, J. McGorrerey, J.W. Waterhouse, amongst whom
the Government grant of &pound;3500 was divided.</p>
<p>It appeared that within three months after leaving Chambers'
Creek, the party arrived at Newcastle Waters, from whence the
work of fresh exploration really commenced. After several
unsuccessful attempts to get beyond the dense forest and scrub
already described, Stuart came upon a succession of ponds.
Pushing forward past a permanent sheet of water, named the Daly
Waters, in honour of the Governor, he entered upon a fine,
well-watered country, and in about 150&deg; of south latitude
came upon the river Strangways, which, in a few days' travel, led
to the river Roper. Mr. Stuart considered the country in the
neighbourhood of the Roper the finest he had seen; the soil
excellent, grass rich and abundant, the river banks richly lined
with cabbage trees, cane, bamboo, and other shrubs. Passing to
the northward, they followed down the river for some distance,
and then made for the Adelaide river, which they reached on the
10th of July. Here, in the midst of lovely scenery and luxuriant
vegetation, with birds of splendid plumage, and with abounding
creeks and watercourses, they lingered for a few days, travelling
gently down the river, and every step bringing them nearer to the
sea-coast, a fact which Stuart kept from the knowledge of the
rest of the party, in order to give them a joyous surprise. The
story of the approach to the sea may best be told in Stuart's own
words.</p>
<p>"At eight and a half miles came up to a broad valley of black
alluvial soil, covered with long grass; from this I can hear the
wash of the sea. On the other side of the valley, which is rather
more than a quarter of a mile wide, is growing a line of thick
heavy bushes, very dense, showing that to be the boundary of the
beach. Crossed the valley and entered the scrub, which was a
complete network of vines; stopped the horses to clear the way
whilst I advanced a few yards on to the beach, and was delighted
and gratified to behold the waters of the Indian Ocean in Van
Diemen's Gulf, before the party with the horses knew anything of
its proximity. Thring, who rode in advance of me, called out,
'The sea!' which so took them all by surprise that he had to
repeat the call before they fully understood what was meant;
hearing which, they gave three long and hearty cheers. The beach
is covered with a soft blue mud; it being ebb tide I could see
some distance; found it would be impossible for me to take the
horses along it; I, therefore, kept them where I had halted them,
and allowed half the party to come on to the beach and gratify
themselves by a sight of the sea, while the other half waited to
watch the horses until their return. I dipped my feet and washed
my face and hands in the sea, as I promised the late Governor,
Sir Richard MacDonnell, I would do if I reached it. . . . I
returned to the valley, where I had my initials cut on a large
tree (J.M.D.S.), as I intended putting my flag up at the mouth of
the Adelaide.</p>
<p>"Thus have I, through the instrumentality of Divine
Providence, been led to accomplish the great object of the
expedition, and take the whole party through as witnesses to the
fact, and through one of the finest countries man would wish to
pass&mdash;good to the coast, and with a stream of running water
within half a mile of the sea. From Newcastle Waters to the
sea-beach the main body of the horses have only been one night
without water, and then got it within the next day. If this
country is settled, it will be one of the finest colonies under
the Crown, suitable for the growth of any and every thing. What a
splendid country for producing cotton! Judging from the number of
the pathways from the water to the beach, across the valley, the
natives must be very numerous. We have not seen any, although we
have passed many of their recent tracks and encampments. The
cabbage and fan-palm trees have been very plentiful during
to-day's journey down to this valley."</p>
<p>On the next day, Mr. Stuart having determined to recross the
continent, he had an open space cleared, selected one of the
tallest trees, stripped it of its lowest branches, and on its
highest branch fixed the Union Jack with his name sewn in the
centre, amid the cheers of the whole party. A paper, enclosed in
an air-tight case, was buried one foot south of the tree, bearing
this inscription:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>"SOUTH AUSTRALIAN GREAT NORTHERN
EXPLORING EXPEDITION.</small></p>
<p>"The exploring party under the command of John McDouall Stuart
arrived at this spot on the 25th day of July, 1862, having
crossed the entire continent of Australia, from the Southern to
the Indian Ocean, passing through the centre. They left the city
of Adelaide on the 26th day of October, 1861, and the most
northern station of the colony on the 2lst of January, 1862. To
commemorate this happy event they have raised this flag bearing
his name. All well. God save the Queen!"</p>
<p>The return journey was accomplished with difficulty: first,
from the weak state of the horses; next, from the annoyances of
natives, who set fire to the grass and otherwise hindered their
progress; and, finally, from the severe sickness of Mr. Stuart.
As the party neared the centre he was seized with a violent
attack of illness, from which he did not expect to recover. He
had been suffering from scurvy for some time previously, his
eyesight nearly failed him, and at one time he almost lost the
power of speech. It is sad to read an entry in his journal, under
date of October 31, where, after "thanking Almighty God that, in
His infinite goodness and mercy, He had so far prolonged his
life," he adds&mdash;</p>
<p>"What a sad difference there is between what I am now, and
what I was when the party left Adelaide! My right hand nearly
useless to me by the accident from the horse; total blindness
after sunset&mdash;although the moon shines bright to others, to
me it is total darkness, and nearly blind during the day; my
limbs so weak and painful that I am obliged to be carried about;
my body reduced to that of a living skeleton, and my strength
that of infantine weakness&mdash;a sad, sad wreck of former
days."</p>
<p>It is difficult, nay impossible, to estimate the importance of
Stuart's great enterprise, not only to the colonies of Australia,
but to the world at large. It is equally impossible to find
language that shall not appear exaggerated to characterize the
heroism and indomitable pluck of this brave and noble man. It is
true he was not the first to cross the continent, although he was
the first to absolutely complete the route from the southern to
the northern coast, for neither Burke nor McKinlay really saw the
northern sea; but he was the first who laid down a line of route,
describing every step of the way in chart and journal, by which
any one might pass with comparative ease from Adelaide to Adam
Bay. How his discoveries were utilized we shall tell
elsewhere.</p>
<p>A great ovation awaited him on his return to
Adelaide&mdash;fetes and banquets were given in his honour; the
Legislature awarded him the sum of &pound;2000 and proportional
gratuities to all the members of his party. The lease of a large
area of land in the north was also granted to Mr. Stuart
rent-free for several years, but his constitution was so
shattered by the exposure to which he had been subjected in his
various explorations that he did not live long to enjoy his
hard-earned honours. In April, 1864, he proceeded to England in
the hope that the voyage and residence in the mother-country
might to some extent restore his health; but this was not to be,
and he gradually sank till death put an end to his short, but
useful, career.</p>
<p>Other explorations undertaken during the administration of Sir
Dominick Daly were useful, but not of startling interest. With a
view to ascertain whether a payable gold-field really existed in
South Australia, which would nut only give employment to many in
the colony, but attract outsiders, the Government secured the
services of Mr. Hargreaves, in 1863, for the purpose of making a
geological survey of the settled districts. He started on the
31st of October, 1863, and returned to Adelaide on the 18th of
June, 1864, having examined the country from Cape Jervis, sixty
miles south of Adelaide, to a point 540 miles north of Adelaide.
He reported that, although gold existed generally from Cape
Jervis to Tanunda, and in paying quantities in the beds of the
Torrens and the Onkaparinga, he did not consider the precious
metal would be found anywhere in sufficiently large quantities to
justify a "rush".</p>
<p>In September, 1864, Major Warburton started on an expedition
to explore the country north and west of Mount Margaret, known as
"No Man's Land"; but, after being absent about two months, he
returned, finding it impracticable to proceed in the desired
direction.</p>
<p>In June, 1866, he made another attempt to accomplish the same
object, but was again compelled to abandon it, and returned to
Adelaide, after an absence of twenty-one weeks.</p>
<p>During that year the Hon. Thomas Elder imported 121 camels
from Kurrachee, which were landed at Port Augusta, and were found
very useful to explorers in crossing the dry parts of the north
country.</p>
<br>
<p>We do not propose to give in detail the history of legislation
during the administration of Sir Dominick Daly. The constant
crises, the ever-recurring resignations, the splits and
compromises, which had, it may be, an absorbing interest in the
passing hour, would be found of little interest now; nor do we
propose to burden our pages with the names of the members of each
successive Parliament, or even the titles of the multitudinous
Bills they passed. We shall, however, glance at the general
action of Parliament during the period under consideration, and
then select for more detailed notice those measures which had a
special and abiding influence on the colony.</p>
<p>The first meeting of Parliament under Sir Dominick Daly was
held on the 25th of April, and the "vice-regal speech" was
considered rather barren, so far as regarded the measures
promised by Government. One of the first Acts of both branches of
the Legislature was to send addresses of condolence to her
Majesty on the irreparable loss she had sustained in the death of
the Prince Consort.</p>
<p>In July the Ministry resigned on a question of "assimilation
of tariffs", but, after explanations, the resignations were
withdrawn.</p>
<p>In September the "Ministry, considering that they had not a
sufficient majority to carry on the business of the country,"
again placed their resignations in the hands of the Governor, but
an arrangement was made that the existing Ministry should
continue in office until the prorogation on the 21st of
October.</p>
<p>On that occasion Sir Dominick brought under the notice of the
House of Assembly the necessity that would soon arise for
increasing the revenue of the colony, and expressed the hope that
the approaching Conference at Melbourne would pave the way "for
the introduction of a uniform tariff throughout the colonies, and
for a mutual interchange, free of duty, of articles of colonial
produce." Referring to the measure known as Sutherland's Act, his
Excellency said it "recognized the sound principle, that increase
of population is necessary alike to occupying fresh country and
to imparting additional value thereto."</p>
<p>The Assessment of Stock Act, by freeing from the burden of
assessment lands at present incapable of bearing this impost,
would, he considered, do much to promote the occupation and
settlement of that enormous territory made known by the
researches and enterprise of Stuart, McKinlay, and other intrepid
explorers, but which, owing to its distance from an available
market, must otherwise have remained valueless.</p>
<p>For many years the English mail service had been a bone of
contention in the Legislature, and at the same time an
inestimable blessing to the editors of the local papers, inasmuch
as the subject always made good "copy". The contention was that
the geographical position of the colony was persistently ignored,
and there was only one way of obtaining the mails without
vexatious delay, namely, by sending a branch steamer for them to
King George's Sound. In September, 1862, the Government accepted
the tender of the Australian Steam Navigation Company for this
service at &pound;1300 per month, and for several years the
anomaly lasted of the branch steamer arriving at Port Adelaide
two or three days before the ocean steamer reached Melbourne, by
which means the English news was telegraphed to the neighbouring
colonies from Adelaide about the same time that the ocean steamer
would be passing within two or three hundred miles of
Investigator's Straits, on the way to Melbourne. By this absurd
and unjust arrangement, South Australia was at the expense of a
separate service, which supplied the earliest intelligence to
those very colonies which placed obstacles in the way of
obtaining the mails from the ocean steamers as they passed within
a short distance of a South Australian port.</p>
<p>The first Parliamentary session under Sir Dominick Daly was
not by any means a barren one; many useful Bills had been
assented to, and one of the measures, that known as Sutherland's
Act, deserves particular mention on account of its subsequent
history. It provided that one-third of the proceeds arising from
the sale of waste lands should be appropriated to immigration,
another third to the construction of roads, bridges, and
such-like work, and the remainder to public purposes, or, in
other words, to secure the expenditure of moneys arising from the
sale of waste lands for those purposes for which they were
originally set apart. When the introduction of immigrants at the
public expense had been discontinued, the one-third reserved for
that purpose had been allowed to accumulate, and, after being
used as a loan, had ultimately become absorbed in the general
revenue.</p>
<p>During the session of 1862, therefore, the Legislature voted
the sum of &pound;25,000 for immigration, allowing time for
Sutherland's Act to come into operation.</p>
<p>The first session of the third Parliament * under the
Constitution Act of 1856 met for the despatch of business on the
27th of February, 1863, and adjourned on the 10th of March to the
9th of April, partly for the purpose of enabling the three
delegates to the Intercolonial Conference to attend without
putting the Legislature to inconvenience. The members selected to
represent South Australia were the Hon. H. Ayers, the Hon. A.
Blyth, and Mr. L. Glyde, M.P. The subjects to be discussed at the
Conference were uniform tariffs, border customs duties, the
postal question, coast lights, an Intercolonial Court of Appeal,
and uniform weights and measures.</p>
<p class="foot">[* At the general election which took place in
November, 1862, about two-thirds of the members of the late
Parliament were returned.]</p>
<p>The Conference was duly held, and the report of proceedings
was published in June. All the reforms contemplated in the
programme were recommended, and many others in addition, such as
the discontinuance of transportation to any portion of the
Australian colonies, the encouragement of immigration, the
improvement of navigable rivers, telegraphic communication with
England, and various questions relating to law. But it is one
thing to hold a conference, and quite another to carry out its
recommendations. To wit, the new tariff agreed upon was
introduced in the South Australian Parliament on the 1st of June,
but was withdrawn on the 4th, because the New South Wales
Government declined to co-operate!</p>
<p>The first session of the new Parliament was anything but
peaceful. On the 30th of June the Ministry resigned and Mr. F.S.
Dutton undertook the formation of a new Ministry, and succeeded;
but when both Houses met on the 7th of July, the Ministry
sustained a defeat in both Chambers, and on the following day
sent in their resignations; whereupon Mr. J.T. Bagot was sent for
to form a Government, but failing, the task was entrusted to Mr.
R.I. Stow, who was also unsuccessful.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark that, notwithstanding these failures,
the extreme step of a dissolution was not so much as suggested.
The Hon. H. Ayers came to the rescue and submitted a list of
names which were approved and duly gazetted.</p>
<p>Soon after, difficulties arose on the question of borrowing
money for public works, but they were tided over, and on the 12th
of November Parliament was prorogued. Up to the very last hour,
however, the Ministry was in jeopardy, a member being in the act
of moving a vote of censure when the arrival of the Governor to
prorogue the Parliament was announced.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** The Legislative Council had sat sixty-six
days, and the House of Assembly 101 days.]</p>
<p>When the second session of the third Parliament was opened on
the 27th of May, 1864, the Governor said, "I believe I am
warranted in saying that at no other period of the colony's
history have we had greater evidence of substantial
prosperity."</p>
<p>Many immigrants had recently arrived from Europe and had found
immediate employment, and the demand for labour continuing
undiminished, the Government anticipated a vote for immigration,
and authorized the despatch of three vessels, to sail
respectively in July, August, and September.</p>
<p>Active legislation soon commenced, but the session was marked
by an irritating number of no-confidence motions, with their
endless ministerial explanations and discussions, wasting an
inordinate amount of time, and threatening serious consequences
to the political welfare of the colony. And the curious part of
it was that the extreme step of a dissolution was again not so
much as suggested.</p>
<p>The outside public summed up the state of affairs in the form
of a resolution carried with enthusiasm at a public
demonstration: "That in the opinion of this meeting the scramble
for office by members of the House of Assembly, regardless of
public policy or political consistency, has delayed the business
of the country, and is calculated to bring into contempt our
present system of Government."</p>
<p>This had little or no effect. There were further skirmishes
between the members of both Houses on the Squatting Question, and
on the 29th of November such an attack was made on the Government
that it was felt at length there was no other course left but to
advise the Governor to dissolve the House, a course he consented
to adopt and carry into effect so soon as the business then on
hand was disposed of.</p>
<p>The first session of the fourth Parliament was opened on the
31st of March, 1865. The Hon. J. Morphett was elected President
of the Council in place of Sir J.H. Fisher, who had retired after
being connected with the Legislature for seventeen years. In the
House of Assembly Mr. G.S. Kingston was elected as Speaker, Mr.
G.C. Hawker, who had previously occupied that office, having
retired for a time from parliamentary life.</p>
<p>Among the subjects touched upon in the Governor's opening
speech was the Melbourne Conference, at which Victoria, South
Australia, and Tasmania were represented for the purpose of
taking joint action for the absolute termination of
transportation to Western Australia, and his Excellency was happy
to state that her Majesty's Government had been pleased to
determine that such transportation should cease after a limited
period.</p>
<p>Among the most useful measures of this session may be
mentioned the Bill for providing for destitute persons in a more
systematic manner than the one previously in operation, provision
also being made for orphans and children of destitute persons.
The erection of a commodious building, known as the Orphanage, at
Magill, was one of the results of this Bill.</p>
<p>A marriage Bill introduced by the Ministry for placing all
ministers of religion on an equality as regarded the celebration
of Holy Matrimony was rejected, not so much on account of the
principle involved, as on certain defects in its construction. A
meeting of "friends of religious equality" was held in Chalmers'
Church, North Terrace, when a committee was appointed to prepare
a suitable Bill. This Bill was passed in the ensuing session,
notwithstanding the strong condemnation of it by Roman Catholics
in and out of Parliament.</p>
<p>In 1866 the ordinary routine of Parliamentary business was
broken for a while in order to pay a tribute of respect to some
of its leading members who were retiring from public life. These
were Mr. J.M. Solomon, Mr. S. Davenport, Mr. C. Bonney, and Mr.
G.F. Angas.</p>
<p>Special reference was made in the House to the loss the colony
would sustain by these retirements, and men of all shades of
opinion in politics expressed their regret. Notably was this the
case in regard to Mr. G.F. Angas.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker, one of the most influential members, said, "In
consequence of his early connection with the colony, his position
in society, his experience, his knowledge of mercantile affairs,
and everything connected with colonization, Mr. Angas was
eminently entitled to their gratitude." Men who differed from Mr.
Angas on many points joined in expressing the opinion that no
other man had done so much to advance the interests of the
colony.</p>
<p>Said Captain C.H. Bagot, an old antagonist, "I always regarded
him as a deep-thinking, clever man, who never hesitated to
declare what he thought was the right view, and was never
overawed by popular clamour. This no doubt brought a good deal of
obloquy upon him, but his conduct was always upright and
consistent, and it was a matter of great regret that they had
lost his services."</p>
<p>The verdict of the press coincided with that of the
Parliament. "Although Mr. Angas," said the leading journal of the
colony, "was not what is known as a popular politician, he
nevertheless won general esteem by the independence, integrity,
and painstaking industry with which his duties as a member were
discharged."</p>
<p>Many years later, one who knew him well * added this
testimony: "I may truly say that no member of the Legislative
Council felt greater interest in its proceedings, nor evinced
more ardour in his desire to lay broad and sound the laws for
effecting the healthy development of the colony and the common
prosperity of all classes of its people, than he did. In his
statesmanlike view, the prosperity of each individual, and of
each industrial class, was the most logical aim and the surest
path to the attainment of the greatest good of all. To a heart
full of sympathy with the best interests of the colony, he
further elevated the character of a legislator by his long and
extensive business experience, his high moral tone, and the
consequent wisdom and prudence of his counsels. It is, however,
as being specially prominent amongst the Fathers and Founders of
the colony that his name will lastingly claim the grateful
recognition of all who have, or may, benefit by being
colonists."</p>
<p class="foot">[* Sir Samuel Davenport. K.C.M.G.]</p>
<p>The fourth session of the fourth Parliament was opened on the
5th of July, 1867. For once the address in reply to the
Governor's speech was passed in both Houses without a
division,-and the business was proceeded with in a way which must
have greatly gratified the occupants of the Treasury Bench.</p>
<p>In the summer of this year the red rust in wheat was a source
of much anxiety and loss to the farmers of the colony. It formed
the subject of a debate in the House of Assembly on a motion to
the effect that, as there was reason to fear that the occupiers
of large areas of land would be unable to cultivate their land
next season, the Government should obtain all possible
information, and take all proper steps to avert so great a
calamity. A select committee was therefore appointed to inquire
into the matter and report.</p>
<p>The session was brought to a close on the 19th of December,
1867. During its continuance much less party spirit had been
shown than heretofore, and for a time office-seeking seemed to
have dropped out of fashion. The consequence was that there was
more useful legislation, and a much larger number of Bills passed
than in many previous sessions, while the astounding fact is
worthy of special record, that not a single ministerial crisis
occurred during the whole period.</p>
<p>It may not unnaturally be supposed by some readers that, in so
small a community as Adelaide, the strong words and heated
discussions in Parliament, the constant throwing over of leaders,
the personal attacks on one another, the rivalry and
defiance&mdash;all fostered and fanned into flame by the
newspaper press&mdash;would give rise to much social
unpleasantness, and tend to destroy personal friendship and good
fellowship. As a matter of fact it did nothing of the kind. Let
an old colonist, and an exceptionally well-informed man, tell the
reason why. "The bitter rancour of political life, which is seen
in some countries," says Mr. William Harcus,** "is comparatively
unknown in South Australia. It is not that our public men do not
feel strongly on political questions, but we are so closely mixed
up in social and business life that we cannot afford to allow
political asperities to pass beyond the region of politics. I
have often seen two or more gladiators denouncing each other in
the House in the strongest language allowed by rules of
Parliamentary debates meet immediately after in the
refreshment-room, when one would smilingly say to the other,
'Have a drink?' and the men who a few minutes ago were
figuratively flying at each other's throats are hobnobbing like
old friends, as they probably are. This is one of the pleasantest
and most creditable features in a political life."</p>
<p class="foot">[** "South Australia; its History, Resources, and
Productions."]</p>
<p>Having briefly glanced at the general routine of Parliament
during the administration of Sir Dominick Daly, we must now turn
to some of the burning questions which in that same period were
engaging the attention, not only of the Legislature, but of every
person interested in the welfare of the colony. The first in
importance was the question of what was to be done with the newly
discovered Northern Territory. And it is probable that, up to
that date, such a gigantic question was never before in the
world's history discussed and decided by a mere handful of men.
Let the reader try, in the first place, to grasp the idea of what
that Northern Territory, or Alexandra Land, was. To a great
extent it was an unexplored country, save for the tracks made by
the gallant explorers who had crossed the continent, and who had
necessarily seen but a limited area. It consisted of 231,620
square miles of territory, or 35,116,800 acres, bounded on the
north by the Arafura Sea, on the south by the 26th parallel of
south latitude, on the east by the 138th meridian of east
longitude, and on the west by the 129th meridian of east
longitude.</p>
<p>Now, as South Australia had been the means of discovering a
practicable route across the continent, certain of the colonists
thought they had a claim to at least a portion of the newly
acquired territory, while others were of opinion that the whole
should be handed over. And those others, as we shall see, carried
the day. Originally the colony contained 300,000 square miles;
then in 1861 "No Man's Land", a strip of land lying between its
western boundary and the eastern boundary of Western Australia,
containing 80,070 acres, was added to it, and finally the whole
of the Northern Territory, thus bringing up the area to 903,690
square miles, or 78,361,600 acres, and making it by far the
largest of the Australian colonies, with the exception of Western
Australia.</p>
<p>When it is borne in mind that the population at this time was
only about 165,000 souls, that the colony had only been in
existence thirty years, that the art of government was only in
its rudimentary stage so far as the colonial legislators were
concerned, it must at least be conceded that the advocates of
this enormous increase of territory were a bold and daring set of
men. Let us now proceed to "set in order" their action in the
matter.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* For part of our information we are indebted to
some admirable articles published in the <i>Register</i>.]</p>
<p>When Sir Richard MacDonnell was Governor, ho took an
enthusiastic interest in exploration, and more particularly in
the adventurous attempts of Mr. J.M. Stuart to cross the
continent. After Stuart's first exploration. Sir Richard, feeling
confident that the goal would soon be successfully attained,
wrote to the Duke of Newcastle, and suggested to the Home
Government that it would be only an act of justice to the colony
to extend its territory to those outlets on the northern coast
which Mr. Stuart had shown would soon be connected by an overland
route with South Australia. The Duke's reply to this was, that as
the overland route had not really been opened, it was altogether
premature to think of attaching the northern country to South
Australia; besides which, it was certain that, at no distant
date, independent settlements, which could not be governed from a
distance, would have to be established on the northern coast.
With this answer the subject was allowed to rest for a while.</p>
<p>The further explorations of Stuart, as well as those of Burke
and Wills, McKinlay, and Landsborough having put the question of
an overland route beyond doubt. Sir Charles Nicholson, who had
been the first President of the Legislative Council in Queensland
and was at the time Chairman of the Colonial Land and Emigration
Commission, and who was in England when the result of the
exploration became known, urged the Duke of Newcastle to lose no
time in making provision for the Government of North Australia.
He pointed out that the footsteps of the explorers would soon be
followed by the squatters who occupied land on the outskirts of
Queensland, and that unless the control of the new country were
placed in the hands of some authority, lawlessness and disorder
would prevail throughout the beautiful region which the labours
of Stuart and others had made accessible. "Within a very few
months," wrote Sir Charles Nicholson to the Duke, "the desire of
occupying new country will tempt many persons, with their
servants and flocks and herds, to locate themselves in this new
district. The probability also is that many individuals who may
have made themselves obnoxious to the laws, will, for the purpose
of escaping the pursuit of justice, betake themselves in the same
direction."</p>
<p>These and other considerations, such as the necessity of
securing the rents of the lands occupied, and the desirability of
encouraging settlement in so valuable a country, led Sir Charles
Nicholson to recommend either that a new colony should be
established, or that the whole of the North and North-west
Territory should be placed under the guardianship&mdash;not of
South Australia, by whose energy the country had been
explored&mdash;but of Queensland!</p>
<p>Strange to say, the Home Government thought well of the latter
suggestion, and after referring the matter to the Emigration
Commissioners, at once offered the control of the country to
Queensland. This was, naturally, more than the South Australians
could stand, and the Government drew up a series of resolutions
in Executive Council, and these were transmitted by Sir Dominick
Daly to the Duke of Newcastle in December, 1862, with the result
that in September, 1863, the Governor received a despatch from
the Duke of Newcastle, placing that portion of the Northern
Territory bounded by the 129th and 138th meridians of east
longitude, and beyond the 26th parallel of south latitude to the
Arafura Sea, under the charge of South Australia, with power "to
revoke, alter, or amend the letters patent annexing the said
territory."</p>
<p>While this concession was the occasion of loud congratulation
among the majority, there were not a few far-seeing men, amongst
whom was Mr. George Fife Angas, who strongly condemned any
attempt to colonize the Northern Territory, predicting losses and
failures as almost inevitable consequences on account of the
inadequate means at its disposal for an undertaking of such vast
magnitude. But their counsels did not prevail.</p>
<p>On the 1st of October the Treasurer introduced a Bill to
provide for the disposal of land in North Australia, which was
read a first time in the House of Assembly. It provided that
500,000 acres of country land might be sold in two several
quantities of 250,000 acres each, the first lot at seven and
sixpence per acre, and the second at twelve shillings per acre,
and 1562 town allotments of half an acre each&mdash;one-half of
the said lots to be open for sale and purchase in London, and
one-half in the colony. The country sections were to consist of
160 acres, with which were to be offered a town allotment of half
an acre. Provision was made in the Bill for the appointment of a
Government Resident, and all other necessary officers for
securing the order and good government of the Territory. The
Treasurer, in introducing the Bill, stated that "the accounts
relating to the new country were to be kept distinct from the
accounts proper to South Australia. The object was to guard this
colony from loss, and to settle the new country at as little
expense as possible. The only advantage (he added) to be derived
by South Australia was a market for its produce."</p>
<p>The regulations subsequently introduced in connection with the
Bill reduced the original quantity to be offered in the first
instance to two lots of 125,000 acres each, and holders of
Parliamentary land orders were to be allowed to exercise their
choice "at any time within five years from the date of the
preliminary land order."</p>
<p>During the passage of the Bill through its various stages Mr.
G.F. Angas renewed his protests from time to time, urging that it
was an unwise thing for the colony, already possessing more than
ample territory and with a limited population, to saddle itself
with the responsibility of such an enormous appanage. He
maintained that it was far beyond the capability of the colony at
that time to manage successfully, and pointed out that settling
the question of the land without making provision for the
introduction of labour would not lead to the settlement of the
country. He submitted an alternative scheme to the effect that,
instead of planting a colony there, large inducements should be
offered to squatters to take up the land, and that a
Company&mdash;somewhat similar to the South Australian
Company&mdash;should be formed and encouraged to attempt the
growth of purely tropical products. Had his advice been taken the
colony would have been saved enormous expenditure and annoyance.
Many who wrote and spoke disparagingly of his views at the time
afterwards acknowledged that they greatly erred in disregarding
his wisdom and foresight.</p>
<p>On the 1st of March, 1864, offices were opened simultaneously
in London and Adelaide for the sale of land in the Northern
Territory, and on the 29th of that month the office at Adelaide
was closed with the following result:&mdash;455 applicants for
118,880 acres of country land, and 743 town allotments of half an
acre each, making a total of 119,251&frac12; acres, the purchase
money for which was &pound;44,719 6<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. The sales
in London were materially assisted by the North Australian
Company, which was formed for the purchase of land in the new
territory, and applied for 25,000 acres.</p>
<p>The proceeds of these land sales were to be devoted in the
first instance to the cost of surveying and settling the country,
and, as there were no other funds available, of course the land
sales took place before the surveys had commenced. The English
buyers, therefore, speculated in faith; the choice of position
was to be settled by lot, and the only guarantee they had was the
pledge of the Government that within five years the land should
be surveyed and ready for selection.</p>
<p>The sale of the land was immediately followed up by the South
Australian Government with the outfit of an expedition to survey
the quantity of land required, and to establish order in the
newly acquired settlement. The command of the expedition was
entrusted to Lieutenant-Colonel B.T. Finniss, who received the
appointment of Government Resident. The choice was considered an
excellent one. Mr. Finniss was an old and highly respected
colonist, who had held the office of Treasurer of the colony,
and, when Sir Henry Young left Adelaide, was acting Governor
pending the arrival of Sir Richard MacDonnell. He was one of the
fathers of the volunteer movement, and had a thoroughly practical
knowledge of surveying. It seemed that he was <i>the</i> man to
fulfil every requirement, and when a banquet was given before the
expedition started, everybody seemed pleased with everything and
with one another, and the future was seen as in a golden
glory.</p>
<p>On the 29th of April the good ship <i>Henry Ellis</i>, well
equipped in every respect, and amply supplied with stores,
instruments, and weapons, set sail from Port Adelaide, having on
board as officers of the expedition Mr. B.T. Finniss, Government
Resident; J.F. Manton, engineer and surveyor; F.E. Goldsmith,
surveyor and protector of aborigines; Ebenezer Ward, clerk in
charge and accountant; Stephen King, storekeeper; John Davis,
assistant storekeeper and postmaster; W. Pearson, J. Wadham, and
A.E. Hamilton, surveyors; E. Watson and J.W.O. Bennett,
draughtsmen, together with a strong party of Labourers and
seamen&mdash;forty-two persons in all, bound for Adam Bay, where
it was thought a suitable site might be found for the first town,
although absolute discretion was left to the Resident in this
respect.</p>
<p>In May the Government schooner Yatala was despatched with a
view to rendering any necessary assistance in navigating rivers,
etc.</p>
<p>Unhappily, grievous dissensions arose among the party on board
the <i>Henry Ellis</i>, which increased immediately after they
landed in Adam Bay, and grew to a head when Mr. Finniss, against
the strong protests and remonstrances of his officers, and the
representations of the land purchasers, selected Escape
Cliffs&mdash;one of the most inaccessible and improbable places
imaginable&mdash;as the site of the first town.</p>
<p>In October intelligence reached Adelaide that
misunderstandings of a most serious nature had arisen between the
Government Resident and his subordinates, and that a collision
had taken place between the Europeans and the natives, to whom
summary and indiscriminate punishment had been administered. The
position was a difficult one, and it cast a gloom over the
prospects of the promoters of the annexation scheme.
Nevertheless, a steamer, the <em>South Australian</em>, was
despatched at once, with forty passengers to be employed in the
Government service in place of any who might be desirous of
returning. This steamer returned to Adelaide on the 1st of
January, 1865, and in consequence of the information brought by
her as to the site selected for the capital a meeting of
land-order holders was held, who memorialized the Government not
to determine on the site of a capital till the whole country had
been examined. This request was acceded to as far as
circumstances would permit, but to make a concession of this kind
necessarily involved a tantalizing delay in the survey of the
laud.</p>
<p>In July, 1865, news reached Adelaide of the total
disorganization of the survey party under Mr. Finniss. Some of
the settlers had purchased a small boat, the <i>Forlorn Hope</i>,
and, sailing by way of Champion Bay, reached Adelaide in safety,
and laid a statement of the condition of affairs before the
Government. Great indignation was expressed in all quarters, and
Mr. Finniss was called upon for full and immediate explanation.
All this was discouraging to those who had invested capital, and
was embarrassing to the Government. But to meet any emergency
that might arise, as well as to supply a pressing demand for
stores and fresh provisions, the Government chartered the barque
<em>Ellen Lewis</em>, which sailed for Adam Bay on the 25th of
September, taking with her Messrs. McKinlay and John Davis, Dr.
Milner, and ten other passengers, with stores, sheep, and
horses.</p>
<p>The explanations of Mr. Finniss were eminently unsatisfactory,
and he was recalled, Mr. Manton, the engineer and surveyor, being
left in command.</p>
<p>The <i>Ellen Lewis</i> returned from the Territory on the 13th
of February, 1866, with Mr. Finniss and a number of passengers on
board. A Court of Inquiry was appointed by the Government to
investigate the causes of the disagreements in the new
settlement. The extent of the disruption that had taken place
became painfully apparent by the number of charges and
counter-charges that were brought under the notice of the Court.
It was an aggravated repetition of the story of Captain Hindmarsh
and the early settlers, and with such a warning within the memory
of some who constituted the pioneer party to Adam Bay, it was
somewhat surprising that they should have drifted into their
present state of hopeless disorganization.</p>
<p>While the Court was sitting the <i>Ellen Lewis</i> returned to
the Northern Territory with eleven passengers and a good cargo of
live stock. On the 16th of May, 1866, a Special Commission of
Inquiry gave in their report condemning Mr. Finniss'
administration of affairs at Escape Cliff's, whereby the members
of the expedition had been obstructed in the execution of their
duties; condemning the selection of Escape Cliffs as the site of
the first town; condemning him for lack of care in protecting the
stores, and lack of skill in dealing with his men, and also in
dealing with the natives with whom the party had come into
collision. On the other hand, it was stated by the Commissioners
that several of the persons comprising the expedition were
totally unsuitable for the work entrusted to them. The inquiry
was one of peculiar difficulty, owing to the extremely
acrimonious feeling on both sides, and especially the strong
personal animosity shown towards Mr. Finniss. The report of the
Commissioners was accepted by the Government, and Mr. Finniss,
although considering himself hardly dealt with, was removed from
his position, or, as it appeared, resigned the office of
Government Resident, on the 25th of May.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Manton was left in charge, and the reports that
came from time to time were unfavourable to his
administration.</p>
<p>In September, 1866, Mr. McKinlay returned from an unsuccessful
attempt to explore the country to the east of Adam Bay, and
delay, vexation, and disappointment became the order of the day.
Parliament and the Executive had no easy time of it, and after
much deliberation it was decided to advertise for tenders for the
survey of 300,000 acres of land.</p>
<p>On the 10th of December eleven tenders were sent in, and were
handed to Mr. G.W. Goyder, Surveyor-General, to report upon. Only
two were capable of serious consideration.</p>
<p>As a preliminary step, before any tender could be accepted,
Mr. Goyder recommended that a competent officer should be sent at
once to the Northern Territory, and should be instructed to visit
the lands in the vicinity of the Victoria, and afterwards land at
Anson Bay and the north coast of Port Darwin and Escape Cliffs,
and, after deciding upon a site for the capital, to return and
call for tenders, stating the actual nature of the country and
the material required to facilitate the carrying out of the
contract. Captain Cadell's services were secured for this
purpose, and with a small party he set sail on the 26th of
February, 1867.</p>
<p>After an absence of fifty weeks he returned and reported upon
the advantages and disadvantages of the places visited. Instead
of accepting any of the tenders, the Government decided to send
Mr. Goyder as head of a new survey party (Mr. Manton and several
of the original survey party sent out in 1864 having returned to
Adelaide), and on the 27th of December, 1868, he sailed in the
<i>Moonta</i> for Port Darwin, that place being considered the
most suitable for the capital.</p>
<p>The tenders sent in had varied from &pound;21,000 to
&pound;100,000, or from one shilling per acre to four shillings
and ninepence halfpenny. Mr. Goyder's estimate for the work was
&pound;25,000, exclusive of cost of transit and of small vessels
for river and mail services, but including salary and provisions
to officers and men to and from the Northern Territory. This
amount was also exclusive of a bonus of &pound;3000 to Mr.
Goyder, but included a bonus <i>pro rata</i> to the officers and
men of the expedition.</p>
<p>While these arrangements were being made by the Colonial
Government, the North Australian Land Company in England and
several of the land-order holders were demanding a return of
their purchase money, with interest, which tended still further
to embarrass the Executive, and the impression was being
extensively forced on the minds of many that the vast territory,
asked for as a boon, might prove a bane to the colony.</p>
<p>How Mr. Goyder performed his mission, and how order was
evolved out of chaos in tho "white elephant" Territory, will be
told in a future chapter.</p>
<p>Throughout the administration of Sir Dominick Daly, the
"Squatter Question" was a subject of debate both in and out of
Parliament, and not only during that period, but more or less
throughout the whole history of the colony. The term "squatter",
according to Mr. J. Henniker Heaton,** was first applied to
persons in the territory of New South Wales, who, about the year
1835, without reasonable means of obtaining an honest livelihood,
had formed stations in the interior, and then carried on
predatory warfare against the flocks and herds in the vicinity.
The term "squatter" is now used to describe one of the most
useful and important classes of the community, principally the
large pastoral tenants who rent the land from the Crown for
grazing purposes. This signification was first applied in the
year 1842, and has held its own ever since.</p>
<p class="foot">[** "Australian Dictionary of Dates", by J.H.
Heaton. London, 1879.]</p>
<p>In the early days of the colony brave and adventurous men with
a little capital went off into outlying districts with their
sheep and a few shepherds, a certain amount of food, and the
wherewithal of procuring more, and, building their rude huts,
settled down to pastoral pursuits. In course of time the dangers
which beset them in the earlier days from the attacks of natives
were minimized, and as success attended the labours of the
squatters, their general condition improved. But the tenure of
the land they occupied was always more or less precarious, the
condition upon which pastoral leases were held being that in the
event of the land being required for agricultural purposes, the
squatter must relinquish his "run" on receiving six months'
notice, but would be compensated for the substantial improvements
he had made.</p>
<p>Many of the squatters in a comparatively short time amassed
large fortunes, while others were much better off financially
than the dwellers in towns, and the consequence was that many
considered it to be a mistake to lease land to them on the low
terms that at one time prevailed. Mr. G.W. Goyder, the
Surveyor-General, was therefore entrusted, with the difficult
task of fixing a new valuation on the renewal of the leases.</p>
<p>His valuations were so high that the squatters were at first
dumbfounded, but soon after raised such an outcry as to challenge
public opinion on the whole question. There arose "squatter
parties" and "anti-squatter parties" in Parliament. On one side
the squatters were represented as having all the sweets "of
colonial life; on the other as poor, oppressed, and struggling
men, to whom every consideration should be shown.</p>
<p>Strange to say, the re-valuations had scarcely been made, than
there set in a period of almost unprecedented drought, and it
continued for two years in succession. The grievances of the
squatters then engaged the careful attention of the Legislature,
and a Commission was appointed to inquire into the whole matter.
As the position of those in the north was considerably aggravated
by this calamitous drought, it was considered by many that they
had a reasonable claim upon the sympathy and forbearance of the
Government; but in consequence of the popular clamour raised
against them as a class, it was not easy to obtain any concession
for them from those who regarded themselves as representatives of
"the people".</p>
<p>The facts elicited by the Commissioners were certainly
calculated to turn the tide of popular prejudice which had set in
against the squatters. But such was not the case. A wide-spread
opinion prevailed that the "people's grass" had been leased to
the squatters at too low a price, and that they were thereby
enabled, in good seasons, to become wealthy in a short time. The
squatters, on the other hand, contended that, as their leases
could not possibly give them a guarantee against drought, it was
unjust that they should pay for feed for their flocks and herds
on land which did not yield such pasture.</p>
<p>The report of the Commission, under the head "Loss of stock
through drought", was startling:&mdash;"235,152 sheep have
perished out of 827,706 since the 30th of September, 1804, to the
same date 1805, and 28,850 head of horned cattle out of 53,355.
The horse stock has also suffered severely, 903 out of 2145 being
reported lost. These losses do not include last year's increase
of lambs and calves, for, with some trifling exceptions, not
worthy of notice, all have perished."</p>
<p>Some of the most severe cases of loss were thus
enumerated:&mdash;"Out of a herd of cattle of 8000 head two years
ago, and which, according to the ordinary rate of increase,
should now number 12,000, only 1600 remain; of 7000 sheep
belonging to the same proprietor, only 800 have been brought
away, and of 550 horses 520 have died. Another proprietor reports
the loss of 1500 cattle out of 3000, and he has deserted the
station, it being impossible to get supplies. Unless heavy rains
fall before Christmas, the whole of the herd must die, it being
utterly impossible to muster them, and even could that be done,
they would not be able to travel away. Several others have lost
three-fourths, and many half, of their entire stock. These losses
have not arisen so much from want of water as from scarcity of
food and length of drought, as in many cases the supply of water
exceeds the feeding capabilities of the run."</p>
<p>In a return made by Mr. Goyder to the House of Assembly,
towards the end of December, it was shown that the estimated loss
to the revenue by making reasonable concessions to those lessees
of the Crown who had suffered by the drought would be about
&pound;40,000.</p>
<p>Eventually a scheme was hit upon, and in closing the session
of Parliament on the 16th of March, 1866, the Governor alluded to
it in these terms: "It is with great satisfaction that I have
assented in her Majesty's name to an Act for extending the term
of occupation to the pastoral lessees of the Crown, believing
that, while conferring a great boon on those who elect to take
advantage of the measure, it will not be detrimental to the
general interest of the community; and the subsequent Act, which
allows the lessees the alternative choice of a remission of rent
in some proportion to the loss of pasturage, is a wise
concession, which the unparalleled state of the country
demanded."</p>
<p>Thus, under very difficult circumstances, the matter was
brought to a satisfactory result.</p>
<p>Public feeling with regard to the squatters was considerably
changed in 1867, the drought having continued for an unexampled
period. A series of resolutions were introduced by the
Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration for affording relief
by allowing them to surrender the leases they held, in exchange
for others to be granted on more liberal terms, and a Bill to
give effect to this was passed with very little opposition.
Although the times were then so hard to the squatters, and many
of them were unable to tide over their difficulties, some did not
suffer in the end, and they continued in the future, as they had
been in the past, among the most prosperous of the colonists.</p>
<p>The imminent wreckage of a Ministry in a peculiar form during
the rule of Governor Daly deserves a passing notice, as it is
among the historic incidents of the colony's history. On the 13th
of April, 1865, Sir Dominick Daly, Sir Henry Ayers, Chief
Secretary, several other Ministers, and a distinguished number of
visitors, among whom was Lady Charlotte Bacon (the Ianthe of
Byron), were being conveyed on the City and Port
Railway&mdash;the Government speculation, which had cost over
&pound;250,000&mdash;by express train from Adelaide on a visit to
H.M.'s sloop <i>Falcon</i>. Mr. Charles Simeon Hare, manager of
railways, was in charge of the train, and he gave instructions to
the engine-driver to put on "all speed". The result was a lurch,
a crash, and two of tho carriages were overturned and flung off
the line. Happily the chain connecting the engine with the train
broke on the instant, and the passengers escaped uninjured. A
Commission of Inquiry sat for seven days, and the blame having
been fixed on Mr. Hare, he was removed from office with
compensation. It is reported that in after years he was wont to
make merry in a subdued fashion on his exploit, and to say that,
"though he never held office in a Ministry, he upset a Ministry
and a Governor on top of it!"</p>
<p>The most memorable event of a general character which marked,
the administration of Sir Dominick Daly was the visit of his
Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh in the steam frigate
<i>Galatea</i>. The intimation that Port Adelaide would be the
first port in Australia that the Prince would visit was received
with enthusiasm, and the loyal colonists took steps to give him
as brilliant a reception as possible.</p>
<p>Towards the end of October (1867), when the arrival of the
Prince was hourly expected, beachrangers were watching day and
night on shore, and others in the Gulf, while the Adelaideans
kept their eyes on the signal-staffs by day, and watched for the
booming of cannon or the blazing of bonfires on Mount Lofty by
night. But, in spite of all this vigilance, the <i>Galatea</i>
steamed quietly up the gulf during the night of the 29th of
October, and came to anchor in Holdfast Bay without any pilot,
and without any visit from those who were on the look-out to
intercept her.</p>
<p>Early next morning the telegraph flashed the news to the
country districts, and all Adelaide and the suburbs were astir.
When the public reception took place on the 31st, it was
calculated that about 35,000 persons were present at different
points, to witness or take part in the procession.</p>
<p>Never had Adelaide seen so great a show. Magnificent triumphal
arches, miles of bunting, forests of evergreens, acres of red and
gold cloth; merry peals ringing from the bells of the Albert
Tower; the booming of cannon; the tramp of volunteers, joined by
the members of friendly societies, the corporations of Adelaide
and other municipalities, and the German Club; the clangour of
bands of music, the thrilling voices of 4000 children singing the
National Anthem; but, more impressive than all, the ringing
cheers and the waving of handkerchiefs, as the first member of
the Royal House of England passed along on Australian soil. At
night there was a general illumination&mdash;a display of
electric and magnesium lights and fireworks. Next day the Prince
held a levee at Government House and laid the foundation stone of
the Victoria Tower of the new post-office, the day's proceedings
terminating with a torchlight procession of 500 Germans. Great
pains had been taken "to render this demonstration in every
respect national; to include in it every German institution in
the colony; to have every German township represented; and to get
everything done exactly as in the Fatherland." This included
transparent lanterns, the singing of the Liedertafel, and so on,
and the whole thing was well done, and appeared to afford the
Prince infinite pleasure.</p>
<p>On the 2nd there was a review of the volunteers and military
on the North Park-Lands, and a presentation of colours to the
Prince Alfred Rifle Volunteers by his Royal Highness. In the
afternoon the Adelaide Amateur Athletic Club gave an excellent
display of sports, and in the evening there was an amateur
performance at the theatre by the officers of the 50th Regiment.
Sunday, the 3rd, was spent by his Royal Highness on board the
<i>Galatea</i>, and Monday was an "open day" so far as public
celebrations were concerned, but steamers were running from the
port to the royal frigate, and took from 2000 to 3000 visitors to
see the <i>Galatea</i>.</p>
<p>On the 5th the Royal Duke laid the foundation stone of the
Prince Alfred (Wesleyan) College, and in the evening there was a
subscription ball in the Town Hall, at which nearly a thousand
people were present. On the following day Gawler and Kapunda were
visited, and in the evening there was a grand display of
fireworks on Montefiore Hill, near Adelaide.</p>
<p>From the 7th to the 9th, the Agricultural and Horticultural
Society held a special exhibition of colonial products and
manufactures, and henceforth the society adopted the prefix of
"Royal" to its title. Over 16,000 persons visited the
exhibition.</p>
<p>On the 9th, it being the anniversary of the birthday of the
Prince of Wales, a civic banquet was given in the Town Hall, at
which 500 persons were present, and on the 11th the Duke and his
suite left Adelaide for Lakes Alexandrina and Albert for sport,
and returned on the 16th. Four days later, the Prince left
Government House for the Port, accompanied by the Governor, of
whose kindness and hospitality the Prince and his party spoke in
the highest terms, and on the 21st the <i>Galatea</i> steamed
down the gulf on her way to Melbourne, leaving the colonists to
the reflection that though the visit of her royal captain had
cost the colony between &pound;20,000 and &pound;30,000 such
visits were likely to be of rare occurrence, and the loyal
feelings they called into existence and fostered were certainly
worth a few thousands, to say nothing of the sights and scenes
they had witnessed and enjoyed during the gay holiday time.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Those who are curious in such matters will
find elaborate details of each day's engagements in "The Cruise
of H.M.S. <i>Galatea</i>", by the Rev. John Milner and O.W.
Brierly. London: 1869.]</p>
<p>On the 12th of March, 1868, intelligence reached Adelaide of
the dastardly attempt of one O'Farrell to assassinate the Duke of
Edinburgh, while attending a picnic near Sydney. The news created
a most painful sensation; prayers for his recovery were offered
up at all the churches, indignation meetings were held, and an
address to the Queen was drawn up and bore 63,689 signatures.</p>
<p>The telegrams announcing the Prince's progress towards
recovery were awaited with anxiety, and the 3rd of May, good
tidings having been received, was set apart as a day of General
Thanksgiving for the preservation from assassination and for the
restoration to health of the Prince.</p>
<p>The subsequent news of the execution of O'Farrell brought the
tragic incident to a close, and by allowing the law to take its
course, Australians generally felt they had done all that was in
their power to do, to wash their hands of the foul deed for which
they were in no way responsible.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole period of the preparations and the visit
of the Duke of Edinburgh, Sir Dominick Daly took an active part,
and although it was patent to every one that he was not in good
health, he did not in any way relax his labours. On the 19th of
December he brought a long and arduous session of Parliament to a
close by the delivery of a brief speech, in which he reminded the
members that the session then closing would probably terminate
the existing Parliament, and that they would shortly be called
upon to appear before their constituents. He congratulated them
upon the Royal visit, and on the loyalty of the colonists;
thanked the Parliament for the liberal means placed at his
disposal for the reception and entertainment of His Royal
Highness, and then touched in general and pleasing terms on the
measures that had been passed during the session favourable to
the pastoral, mining, and agricultural interests.</p>
<p>On the 19th of February, 1868, exactly two months after
bringing the session to a close, the tolling of the large muffled
bell in the Albert Tower and the half-mast-high flag at the
entrance to the Government Domain told the sad tale that the
Governor's earthly career was ended.</p>
<p>For some time previously he had been in a bad state of health;
his lack of colour and of physical vigour had been noticed by
every one, and medical men were prepared to hear that anaemia was
the cause of death.</p>
<p>The end was sudden, and he died literally in harness; not only
had arrangements been made a day or two before to hold a meeting
of the Executive Council within an hour or two of the time that
he breathed his last, but he was engaged in public business
immediately before the final seizure.</p>
<p>The funeral took place on the 22nd of February, and, like the
day when Sir Dominick arrived in the colony, the heat was almost
unbearable. Nevertheless, some 14,000 to 15,000 persons lined the
route to the cemetery, and, as all that was mortal of the late
Governor was borne along on a gun-carriage and surrounded by
military pomp, there was overwhelming evidence that his loss was
deeply mourned.</p>
<p>An admirable review of Sir Dominick Daly's administration was
given in the <i>Register</i>, and it expressed exactly the
estimation in which he was held by the colonists from first to
last. "Among the finest traits of an admirable character should
be placed the tact and prudence whereby he averted the threatened
calamity of religious discord. Among the grounds of our regret
for his untimely loss it should not be forgotten what he suffered
in the early part of his career on this point. His personal
amiability and political impartiality soon lived it down, but
while it existed it must have been a painful obstacle to the
usefulness he had so sincerely at heart. No other person ever
took office under such a serious disadvantage. None gained so
steadily in public favour when he came to be known as he really
was. There has been no other of whose career it could so truly be
said that he left none but friends behind him. . . . Six years
ago he came to us a stranger, and we received him, not without
prejudices and misgivings. To-day we can all of us say in our
hearts that we wish he had been spared many years longer to rule
us. In his quiet, modest fashion, he had lived through much,
learned much, and done a great deal more than the world gave him
credit for. His career was singularly free from tinsel and
dramatic effect, but all who study his biography will find in it
the genuine characteristics of human worth. Remembering, as we
ought, the peculiar difficulties of his position, we cannot be
too grateful for the peace and prosperity which have attended his
rule."</p>
