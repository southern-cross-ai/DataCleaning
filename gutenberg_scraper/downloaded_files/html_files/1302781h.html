<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>Shadows moved behind the broad lattice that formed the upper
part of the heavy wooden doors at the gallery's end. Those nearest,
observing this and knowing what it portended, caught their breath.
From these, apprehension ran like a wave over the groups assembled
in that long narrow avenue of doom, stilling their chatter as it
went, until in a moment all was silence.</p>
<p>Upon that silence the rasping of a key in its lock rang like a
pistol-shot. One of the ponderous wings of the great door swung
inwards. The turnkey entered, brawny and swarthy, his blue shirt
gaping away from a broad hairy chest, a fur bonnet on his cropped
head, a yellow bloodhound at his heels. He stood aside on the broad
platform at the head of the steps, to give passage to a brisk young
gentleman in a tight black frock and a round black hat that was
adorned by a buckle in front and a cockade at the side. A paper in
his hand drew the eyes&mdash;some scared, some apathetic, some
proudly indifferent, and some defiantly scornful&mdash;of the
hundred or so men and women assembled there from their various
quarters for the daily purpose of hearing that paper's contents.
For this slim young gentleman, Robert Wolf, clerk of the
Revolutionary Tribunal, was the adjutant of the Public Accuser. His
paper bore the list over whose preparation Fouquier-Tinville had
laboured half the night, in his little room in the Tower of Caesar:
that room of the Palais de Justice where he had his being, where he
worked and slept, which he never quitted save to dine and to
discharge before the Tribunal the dread functions of his office.
For a man of unremitting zeal was this Fouquier-Tinville, a
conscientious public servant who spared himself so little in his
labours on behalf of the Nation, that in the pursuit of duty he
neglected himself, his health, his wife and his children.</p>
<p>The Citizen Wolf stepped briskly to the edge of the platform,
placed himself so that the light should fall upon his paper, and
disposed himself to read the names of those whom Fouquier-Tinville
summoned that morning to judgment: the fournée, or baker's batch,
as it was called in the cynical jargon of the day.</p>
<p>Having chosen his position, the clerk waited until three men who
followed him had come to a standstill, so that the hollow ring of
their steps upon the planking should not obscure his utterance. Not
on that account did they hurry themselves. Two of them, men of
middle age, both dressed in black, one tall and portly, the other
short and wizened, took their time deferentially from the third
who, walking a little in advance, appeared to conduct them.</p>
<p>This was Chauvinière, the Nivernais deputy, a tall slim fellow,
of an age not over thirty, of a certain vigorous elegance of figure
and poise, of a certain elegance even in his dress. He wore a
riding-coat with broad lapels and silver buttons, the tails of
which reached almost to the heels of his Hessian boots. Spotless
buckskins cased his long, lean legs so closely that every muscle
was defined, and a cravat of spotless white clothed his neck
stiffly to the chin. He was girt by a tricolour sash, and a
tricolour cockade adorned his grey hat, which was cocked in front,
à la Henri IV, and surmounted by a panache of black plumes. Thus
were his office and his sans-culottism advertised, and if some
there were who thought them advertised too elegantly for sincerity,
our gentleman was not to be perturbed. His sans-culottism stood too
high, had been too fully proven, to be shaken by any gibes at his
apparel; whilst his arrogance, audacity, and self-assurance were a
panoply against vulgar criticism. These qualities were to be read
in his lean, sallow countenance with its high-bridged nose, its
curled upper lip, and its keen light eyes under level black brows.
There was a certain raffish-ness in his air, an indescribable
quality that proclaimed him half-gentleman, half-valet; half-wolf,
half-fox.</p>
<p>With a leisureliness that took no account either of the waiting
clerk or of the agonized suspense and the pounding of a hundred
hearts in that assembly, which he eyed so coldly, Chauvinière
selected his point of vantage, at a little distance from Robert
Wolf, and descended the first step, so that his two companions in
black immediately behind him, obtained, from the summit of the
platform, a clear view over his head.</p>
<p>His keen eyes raked the gallery and the men and women in that
throng, most of whom were so scrupulously dressed that, saving for
the absence of powder from their heads, they might have been
gathered together for a lévee. This was a daily miracle performed
upon slender enough resources by the prisoners in the
Conciergerie.</p>
<p>The deputy's hungry eyes quested on until they came at last to
rest upon Mademoiselle de Montsorbier, standing slim and straight,
beside the chair into which her mother had nervelessly collapsed.
Incredibly fearless and resolute she stood, with scarcely loss of
colour to her lovely face. But the blue-green eyes dilated a little
and flickered as they met the deputy's kindling glance. Her slight
bosom moved perceptibly under its crossed muslin fichu, to betray a
sudden agitation which not even the advent of the list had been
able to arouse.</p>
<p>Chauvinière half-turned to the men in black behind him. He said
something in a low voice into an obsequiously lowered ear, and with
his silver-mounted cane&mdash;the only weapon he carried&mdash;he
deliberately pointed. Three pairs of eyes followed the direction of
the pointing, and Mademoiselle de Montsorbier stiffened under that
volley of glances to whose purport she possessed no clue, but which
instinctively she felt to bode no good.</p>
<p>Then the pointing cane was lowered, and the three men ranged
themselves decorously, as Robert Wolf began to call the names of
the doomed. His voice droned emotionlessly. Like Fouquier-Tinville
himself, he was simply a part of the great revolutionary machine.
There was no personal responsibility in what he did, and it was not
for him to indulge feelings and emotions over actions that were not
his own. He was a voice, no more: the summoning voice of the
Tribunal. Because practised in his functions, he paused after each
name, so as to allow the hush to be resumed, lest the next name
should be lost to his audience in the sounds that ensued upon each
of his utterances. To answer each summons there would now be a
gasp, now a rustling stir about a person named, now a sob of
terror, sometimes a laugh, occasionally a reckless answer, and more
occasionally still an outcry of hysterical panic quickly sinking
into shuddering sobs.</p>
<p>The voice droned on:</p>
<p>"The ci-devant Marquis de La Tourette."</p>
<p>The Marquis, a middle-aged exquisite in a blue coat with silver
lace, threw up his head&mdash;the handsome head that so soon would
leave his shoulders&mdash;and sharply caught his breath. In an
instant he recovered. He remembered what was due to his blood and
his self-respect. He shrugged and smiled in deprecation, for all
that his face was of the colour of chalk.</p>
<p>"It will break the monotony," he said softly to a neighbour, as
the next name was being called.</p>
<p>"The ci-devant Comtesse de Montsorbier."</p>
<p>Madame de Montsorbier, a slender little woman of fifty,
half-rose from her chair, beginning an inarticulate cry on which
she seemed to choke. Then her knees were loosened, and she sank
down again, leaning sideways against her daughter. Mademoiselle de
Montsorbier, rigid now and piteously white, set protecting arms
about her half-swooning mother, listening the while to the clerk's
voice and waiting to hear her own name, almost hoping to hear it,
in her selfless anxiety to accompany her mother before the Tribunal
and thence to the scaffold. All that she realized was that in her
agony, the frail woman who had borne her would require her as she
had never required her yet. Solicitude for her mother effaced all
consideration of herself and her own fate. That was the mettle of
Mademoiselle de Montsorbier, and her deepest dismay was not reached
until the list had come to an end without her own name having been
pronounced.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a name="pic-2" id=

"Illustration"></p>
<p class="caption">Madame de Montsorbier sank down again, leaning
sideways against her daughter</p>
<p>The summoned twenty were passing out, some faltering, some in
grim resolve, a few with histrionically jaunty ease after brief
farewells.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de Montsorbier heard as in a dream the Marquis de
La Tourette's pleasant level voice, addressing the Due de
Chaulnes.</p>
<p>"For once I take precedence of you, Monseigneur."</p>
<p>To which his grace retorted lightly:</p>
<p>"To my infinite regret, since we lose your pleasant company,
dear Marquis. But we shall rejoin you presently; I trust in
Paradise. My compliments to Fouquier-Tinville."</p>
<p>Two gendarmes, coming she knew not whence, surged suddenly
before her.</p>
<p>"The ci-devant Montsorbier," said one of them, and set a hand
upon the drooping shoulder of Madame.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de Montsorbier turned to him, deserted for once by
her self-possession, and unable in her mental distress to marshal
her tumultuous thoughts into coherent expression.</p>
<p>"But it is my mother! There is some error. She cannot go without
me. You see how feeble she is. My name has not been called. It is
an omission. You see that it is an omission. You will tell them
that it is an omission. You will let me go with her."</p>
<p>Thus, in a confused torrent, the phrases tumbled from her
lips.</p>
<p>The man looked at her sullenly, dubiously, his nether lip
projected. He lowered his head. "Not our affair." He shook the
Countess, who was not more than half-conscious. "You are to come
along, citoyenne."</p>
<p>"But I may go with her? I may go with her?"</p>
<p>"It is not in the order."</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de Montsorbier wrung her hands. "But you can
explain to your Tribunal!"</p>
<p>"Ah, bah! What's your hurry to sneeze into the basket? Your turn
will come soon enough, citoyenne. Lend a hand, Gaston."</p>
<p>Between them, the two men dragged the Countess to her feet, and
half-carried, half-led her away. The girl sprang after them.</p>
<p>"I may come, too; may I not? I may..."</p>
<p>A blow in the stomach from the elbow of one of the guards cut
short her breath, and sent her hurtling backwards. "Faith! You're
too cursedly persistent! You make yourself a nuisance, my
girl!"</p>
<p>She reeled to the wooden chair the Countess had vacated, struck
her legs against it, and fell into it rather than sat down.</p>
<p>"Mother!" she gasped aloud, when at last her breath returned.
"Mother!"</p>
<p>White-faced she sat, in stony tearless grief, her long fine
hands clutched between her knees.</p>
<p>Just so, a month ago, had her father been rent from them, to
take his trial; and hers it had been since then to comfort and
sustain her mother. Now her mother, too, was gone; and alone, that
frail lady, who had never been alone, who was in all things
helpless. She would not return. None of those who were summoned
ever did return, and they were few, very few, who escaped the chill
caress of the guillotine to be set at liberty.</p>
<p>Why had she been left? Why had it been denied her to continue to
the end the only useful purpose she could serve in life? What now
remained for her?</p>
<p>A voice was speaking at her elbow, a crisp, level voice, not
unpleasant, although pitched in a tone almost ironical.</p>
<p>"This is the young woman who claims your attention, citizens.
You observe her listlessness, her unnatural pallor, the vacancy of
her stare. Perform your office. It is not for me to direct you, or
even to suggest; but for you to judge."</p>
<p>She swung half-round, looking up, challenge, defiance, alarm all
blending in her glance, like some trapped wild creature suddenly
confronted by its trapper. She met the light eyes of Chauvinière,
piercing, mocking eyes which she had grown to hate, and even to
fear, she who had never feared anything in all her proud young
life.</p>
<p>A half-dozen times in the last three weeks had she found those
eyes upon her in a questing, measuring, soullessly appraising
glance, which had scorched her from head to foot. Twice already had
he found occasion to speak to her as he passed through the
prisoners' gallery on a visit which appeared to have no Other
object but that of addressing her. Each time she had commanded
herself so as to dissemble from him her resentment at the insult
which his look and word conveyed, and so as to answer him with an
icy dignity which placed a whole world between them. She would
command herself now. He should never guess her fear of him, this
dishonouring fear for which she loathed herself.</p>
<p>The two men in black were gravely considering her, the taller
one leaning forward a little. He extended a plump hand, and took
her wrist.</p>
<p>"Your pulse, citoyenne."</p>
<p>"My pulse?" she heard herself questioning in a distant voice,
and knew by the drumming of her temples that her pulses were
galloping. Then, above considerations of herself, rose again the
momentarily whelmed memory of her bereavement. "You,
monsieur...citizen, citizen-deputy! They have taken madame my
mother, and by an omission I have been left. Give order, monsieur,
I implore you, that my name be added to the list of the day..."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Chauvinière, with so singular an emphasis that it
arrested her intercession.</p>
<p>He looked at the men in black with a significant lift of his
black brows. "You hear her, citizen-doctors! Is that the request of
a young woman who is sane. To desire&mdash;indeed, to
implore&mdash;death at that age, when life unfolds itself like a
perfumed rose, when the blood runs warm and clear! Is not that a
sufficient confirmation of what already I suspected? But'&mdash;and
again there was that flash of mockery from those light
eyes&mdash;'it is not for me to influence your opinion. You must
form judgment for yourselves. Proceed! Proceed!" He waved a hand, a
hand that was long and slender as an aristocrat's and as graceful
in the gesture, which subtly blended invitation with command.</p>
<p>The doctors sighed and grunted. "For my own part," said the
shorter one, "I do not like her eyes. This wild, hunted look, and
this general expression of distraction...hem! Hem!"</p>
<p>"And then her pallor, as the citizen-deputy says," put in the
other. "Most unnatural! And this pulse! But feel it for
yourself."</p>
<p>She laughed. It was the laugh of a bitterness too sharp for
tears.</p>
<p>"Unnatural! My pallor, my pulse, my hunted look! Unnatural! And
my mother has just been taken from me, to judgment and the
scaffold. You would have me calm, messieurs? Gay, perhaps? My
mother..."</p>
<p>"Sh, my child!" The little doctor's hand was on her brow, his
thumb was doing something with her eyelids. But his manner was
soothing, almost hypnotic. "Do not exalt yourself, citoyenne. Calm,
if you please! Quite calm! Here is no need for transports or
excitement. We are your friends, citoyenne. Friends." He addressed
Chauvinière. "What she says, of course, is just. The excitement of
the moment, the unhappy event of which she has just been the
witness, her natural pain at the..." His voice trailed into
silence, leaving the sentence unfinished, for Chauvinière's black
brows were knit in a frown that made him shiver.</p>
<p>"Of course, of course," said the deputy's voice, and it was cold
as ice, or&mdash;thought the little doctor despite himself&mdash;as
the knife of the guillotine: cold and sharp, incisive and sinister.
"It is for you to form the opinion. Not for me to direct you. But
you will remember&mdash;that is, if you consider my observations
worth remembering&mdash;that I brought you here precisely because I
have upon other occasions witnessed these same traits in the
citoyenne, at times when no external cause could be discerned such
as may be held fortuitously to have arisen now."</p>
<p>The little doctor clutched at salvation. "Ah, but that is
decisive," he exclaimed with complete conviction of tone. "If these
symptoms&mdash;this pulse, this pallor, these twitchings, this
glassy stare and...and the rest&mdash;have been manifest constantly
and without adequate cause, one conclusion only is possible. At
least," he added with a glance at his colleague, "that is my
opinion."</p>
<p>"And mine," said the other sharply. "Emphatically, mine. It
admits of no discussion. It leaps to the eye."</p>
<p>Chauvinière's lips twitched momentarily. "It is gratifying,
citizen-doctors, for a layman to find his scientific suspicions
confirmed by men of science. You will, then, certify the citoyenne,
so that the Public Accuser may authorize her removal to a hospice;
to the Archevêché, for instance."</p>
<p>"Justice demands no less," said the little man.</p>
<p>"And humanity," added the taller one.</p>
<p>"Naturally," said Chauvinière. "Justice and humanity must agree
that this afflicted girl is in no case to plead; and the
Revolutionary Tribunal has too high a sense of its duties to wish
to arraign a person who is, be it temporarily or permanently,
without the wit to defend herself. If you will send your
certificate to the Public Accuser to-day, your responsibility in
the matter ends. Citizens, there is no reason to detain you."</p>
<p>He inclined his head in dismissal, haughty as a prince of the
Old Régime. The doctors bowed low and obsequiously as if to the
blood royal, and turned to depart.</p>
<p>"Ah, but wait!" cried Mademoiselle de Montsorbier on a sudden
note of sharpness. "Sirs, sirs!"</p>
<p>But the deputy's commanding hand waved them definitely away.
Then his eyes swung slowly to the girl's face. She was on her feet
now confronting him, and she was, or appeared to be, entirely
fearless.</p>
<p>"Is it pretended that I am mad?" Her question was a
challenge.</p>
<p>He admired her spirit, and commended the fastidiousness of the
instincts which had rendered her desirable in his eyes. She was too
fine, too clean-cut and delicately shaped to make appeal to a man
of coarse sensibilities. His discernment had perceived in that
slender, lissom body a spirit over which no gross fellow could ever
hope for empire. He was something of a student, this
Chauvinière&mdash;who in pre-revolutionary days had been, like so
many others who were on the summits now, a failure as a man of law.
He was, too, something of a poet at heart, and something of an
epicure in sensations. He knew that abiding beauty is of the mind,
and that where beauty of the mind is absent a superficial beauty of
the body will soon grow nauseous.</p>
<p>The spirit which she now displayed, standing tense, defiant,
almost scornful to challenge him, confirmed his first discernment.
He smiled a little.</p>
<p>"Must you quarrel with a pretence which will give you life,
which will snatch you from under the knife of the guillotine? If
you do, and at your age, then you are as mad as they are about to
certify you."</p>
<p>A dozen questions leapt to her tormented mind. She uttered
one.</p>
<p>"What is your interest in me, monsieur, that my life should be
your concern?"</p>
<p>"Ah, that!" His dark brows went up, a faint smile illumined his
face, a smile so gently wistful, that it almost rendered sweet and
delicate his whole expression. "Citoyenne, you ask too many
questions; more than it would be discreet to answer. I take my
leave."</p>
<p>He doffed his plumed hat and bowed, then turned and walked away,
erect, his head thrown back, looking neither to right nor to left
upon the aristocrat prisoners who made way for him. He ignored
alike the malevolent glances of the men and the insults of the
women expressed in a hasty drawing aside of skirts lest they should
become contaminated by contact with his person.</p>
<p>He was a man who succeeded by disregarding trifles.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>The citizen-deputy Chauvinière, representative in the National
Convention of the constituency of Nevers, chose, as became a
legislator of his notorious zeal, to make an inspection of the
Archevêché, the whilom Palace of the Archbishop of Paris, now
converted into a hospital for prisoners.</p>
<p>Baziret, the doctor in charge, conducted him, and was filled
with terror by the deputy's uncompromising denunciations of the
manner in which he found the place conducted, the abominable
overcrowding, the mephitic atmosphere, the general insalubrity.</p>
<p>"This is not human," he declared, as they turned away from a
suffocating gallery. "After all, they are men, not beasts; and
although they have not yet been tried, already, it seems, are they
subjected here to punishment such as the Nation could not desire
for her vilest malefactors. They are flung to lie in straw like
swine, men and women who are ill, some of them already dying! And
you pack sixty into a space that could comfortably contain thirty!
It is inhuman, barbarous, almost beyond anything ever perpetrated
by the despots."</p>
<p>Under those stern light eyes the portly Baziret trembled in body
and in soul.</p>
<p>"What would you, citizen-deputy? Every day the authorities send
me more of these sick from overcrowded prisons in which they cannot
do other than fall ill. And my resources, then! They are utterly
inadequate. The space at my command here is what you see. I cannot
build new wings to the Archevêché."</p>
<p>"But you can keep clean the space you have; and you can avoid
being pert with me, if you please. I dislike pertness. It is the
sign of a shallow mind."</p>
<p>"Pert? I?" The doctor descended to further depths of panic. "Oh,
but citizen-deputy, I assure you..."</p>
<p>"Enough!" His peremptoriness was terrific. "Also I dislike
servility. It was well enough in the days of Capet. It will not
serve in a glorious Age of Reason, when all men are free, when all
men are equal, when all men are brothers. There are no masters now.
Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"Oh, but perfectly, citizen-deputy."</p>
<p>"I congratulate you. Let us pass on." Never was demeanour of
Sultan towards a slave of his household more contemptuous. "What
have you above?"</p>
<p>"Above? Oh, above!" The doctor had fondly imagined the
inspection at an end. "Oh, but nothing that deserves your
trouble."</p>
<p>"All things deserve trouble at the hands of a zealous servant of
the Nation. Make a note of that, citizen-doctor. It may stimulate
your own zeal."</p>
<p>The brow-beaten man of medicine bowed in silent awe.</p>
<p>The Apostle of Liberty and Fraternity, continued:</p>
<p>"Conduct me, if you please." And he waved a hand upwards. "The
state of things I find here is to be the subject of a report I
shall present this evening to the Convention. This scandal must be
brought to an end."</p>
<p>The doctor, his hand upon the baluster, his foot in its neatly
buckled shoe upon the first step of the staircase, paused and
turned. His face was grey.</p>
<p>"In justice, citizen-deputy, you cannot lay this...this scandal
to my charge. I..."</p>
<p>"You waste my time; and my time belongs to France. It is
necessary to remind you of the most obvious things. You may depend,
citizen-doctor, upon strictest justice. The reign of injustice
ended with the abominable régime of the despots. I shall report as
I find." He relented a little from his austerity. "So far I have no
fault with you, personally. You have been frank. You have concealed
nothing. You have placed no difficulties in the way of my
investigations. All of which is in your favour. Continue so, and
you shall have no cause to fear my report. What do you hide
above-stairs?"</p>
<p>The doctor breathed freely at last. He even ventured a little
laugh as he replied: "Hide? Hide, citizen-deputy? But what should I
hide?"</p>
<p>"That is what I am asking you."</p>
<p>"Oh, but nothing. Nothing. All is open for your inspection."
They began to ascend the broad staircase. "Here above are a few
persons whom it has been necessary to segregate, a few unfortunates
who have been certified as demented."</p>
<p>"Demented!" Chauvinière seemed surprised. "So that to a hospital
in which already there is not room for the sick, they send also
those who should be in a madhouse! What infamy!"</p>
<p>Baziret agreed as he would have agreed with anything the august
deputy might say. If those upper chambers could be cleared of their
tenants, he might establish there another ward, and thus relieve
the congestion below. "The mad," he deplored, "take up so much
room."</p>
<p>"I've noticed it," said Chauvinière. "They overcrowd the
world."</p>
<p>On the upper floor the inspection was resumed. Baziret unlocked
door after door of those chambers of solitary confinement,
disclosing here an old man, there an elderly aristocratic woman,
and in each chamber the same simple arrangement of deal chair and
deal table and in a corner of the floor a mattress and
blankets.</p>
<p>At last, to end the impatience which Chauvinière had perfectly
dissembled, Baziret unlocked a door to reveal the person who was
the cause of all this zeal on the deputy's part; the person for
whom, or for his own ends with regard to whom, he burrowed in all
that he now did and was presently to do. And so deep underground
and so skilful was his burrowing that on the surface of things
there was nothing to betray his labours.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de Montsorbier occupied the room's only chair,
which she had placed by the barred window. She turned her head as
the door opened, and started a little at sight of Chauvinière, who
considered her judicially, without any sign of recognition. He
found her paler than her wont, her eyes a little strained, her
features a trifle drawn. But in the main less changed perhaps than
he had expected after the week that had passed since her mother's
execution and her own removal from the Conciergerie; and the
change, he observed, with that discriminating eye of his, was not
at all disfiguring. Suffering had heightened her spiritual,
ethereal air. Inwardly he spared a sigh for the philosophic
reflection that suffering is, after all, man's most refining
influence.</p>
<p>"Who is this." he asked coldly.</p>
<p>Baziret informed him, what time Chauvinière continued to regard
the patient.</p>
<p>"Ha!" he said at last. "My faith, she does not look mad, that
one."</p>
<p>"Alas! Often is it so with them. Their appearance deceives the
shrewdest."</p>
<p>"But if you doctors may be deceived one way, you may also be
deceived another." He fixed Baziret with eyes of terrible
suspicion. "I can even imagine circumstances in which you might
desire to be deceived."</p>
<p>Baziret shivered. "You mean, citizen?"</p>
<p>"Ah, bah! You understand me well enough. This girl now..." He
broke off, considering her again, chin in hand. Then abruptly, a
man who takes a sudden resolve, he waved the doctor away. "I'll
talk to her," he said. "It is my duty to satisfy myself in every
case where..." Again he broke off. "Wait for me at the end of the
corridor. Out of earshot."</p>
<p>The doctor bowed again in his scared obsequiousness, and was
gone. Chauvinière's eyes followed him. They were sly, mocking,
contemptuous. At last he stepped within the room, and closed the
door.</p>
<p>"That comedy is played," he said gently, as if taking her into
his confidence, as if making her a partner in his intentions.</p>
<p>"You play comedy, monsieur?"</p>
<p>Calm and level came the question in that pleasantly modulated
voice. It startled him. He inclined his head a little.</p>
<p>"To serve you, citoyenne."</p>
<p>She had risen, and stood now straight and slim in her muslin
fichu and full petticoat, which was in broad stripes of blue on
grey. Her back was to the window and the pale gold of the March
sunlight, so that her face, in shadow, remained indistinct. Her
voice, however, assured him of completest self-possession.</p>
<p>"But It Is not a comedy of manners, I think."</p>
<p>"Of manners?" He was piqued. Her meaning escaped him, and he did
not like meanings to escape him. It did not often happen. "And why
not of manners, if you please?"</p>
<p>"Because for that you have forgotten something."</p>
<p>"What have I forgotten?"</p>
<p>"To remove your hat."</p>
<p>The audible arresting of his breath betrayed his amazement. Then
laughter broke across his face: broadly, but silently, for he
remembered the doctor at the end of the corridor.</p>
<p>"They are right to have certified you mad, citoyenne," he said
softly. "Decidedly you must leave here for a madhouse."</p>
<p>She shrank until her shoulders touched the bars of the
window.</p>
<p>"What horror! What infamy! You know, you know that I am not mad.
It was by your contriving that..."</p>
<p>"Sh! Hush! Hush! Name of a name!" His alarm was real. His eyes
swept uneasily to the door. His head inclined a little, like one
who listens. "Talk so, citoyenne, and you destroy us both."</p>
<p>She trilled a note or two of laughter, in mockery of him and his
sudden fears.</p>
<p>"In this land of freedom, monsieur, in this Age of Reason of
which you are one of the priests, surely a woman may destroy
herself without comment if she will. And as for your destruction;
can you conceive that it would concern me?"</p>
<p>He sighed. "I have admired your spirit, citoyenne. I begin to
fear you have too much of it." He approached her by a step or two.
"You are very young. Can you already have been so robbed of what we
call illusions that you must count every man your enemy? If so,
then it would be idle to protest that I am your friend; that I
labour to give you back the liberty and the life which at your age
should be very dear and precious; that to this end I have schemed
and wrought, and to this end am ready to continue even at the risk
of my own neck. If you are not convinced by the evidence already
afforded you, if you are unwilling to stake upon it your life,
which otherwise is forfeit, then, citoyenne, I had better depart
again and leave you to your fate. It would imperil me too deeply to
labour to persuade you; just as it might imperil me to be found
bareheaded here, which is the only reason why I did not remove my
hat."</p>
<p>Conviction of one injustice done may often temper a whole
outlook. And Mademoiselle de Montsorbier, feeling herself convicted
now in the trivial matter of his hat, wondered whether she might
not, after all, have judged him as rashly and by inferences as
faulty in those other graver matters.</p>
<p>She considered him, and found in him now a certain dignity,
which was not without appeal.</p>
<p>"But why," she asked quietly, "should you desire to serve
me?"</p>
<p>A smile momentarily softened his saturnine countenance. "I do
not believe a man has lived since the world began who did not at
some time desire to serve one woman."</p>
<p>That was plain enough, and the traditions in which she had been
reared rendered it an insult in her eyes. She let him see this
clearly in her sudden stiffening, the uptilting of her chin, the
frown above her blue-green eyes, and the angry flush that stained
her delicately tinted face.</p>
<p>"You forget your place, sir," she told him, speaking as to an
impertinent groom. "You presume insufferably."</p>
<p>If it stung him, he betrayed no hurt. His gentle smile grew even
gentler, sadder. It was within his considerable psychological
knowledge that he who would gain empire over a woman must begin by
making himself her slave.</p>
<p>"Presume? Is it presumption to state an historical truth? Do I
ask for anything? Do I demand wages for the service I proffer? I am
at your command, citoyenne, to save your life, because..." He
paused, and made a little gesture of self-deprecation. "Because the
desire to serve you, without guerdon or hope of guerdon, is
stronger than myself. Is that to presume?"</p>
<p>"No, monsieur. It is to be incredible."</p>
<p>Gravely he considered her, standing there so slim and straight,
a figure almost boyish save for the slight swell under her muslin
fichu, her delicately featured face so supremely composed, and the
sunlight behind her setting a glowing nimbus about her golden
head.</p>
<p>"Incredible, yes," he agreed at last. "I have often been
accounted that. There is a twist in my nature. My mind was cast in
an ironical mould. The unexpected beckons me. One of these days it
may beckon me to my destruction. But I shall go with a smile,
savouring the moment." He waited for no answering comment, but
swept on, quickening his tone to a brisker pace. "We waste time,
citoyenne. Listen, and afterwards resolve yourself. You will have
leisure for thought between this and the event. Mistrust me, and
remain to be presently guillotined; or trust me, and let me lead
you back to life. That shall be as you please. I offer; but I do
not persuade. Listen now."</p>
<p>Swiftly, briefly he traced for her the course of events to come.
He would procure the removal of the mental cases in the Archevêché
to a madhouse in the rue du Bac, whence evasion would be easy. The
removal would take place in the course of the next day. As soon as
it was effected, he would depart for the Nivernais, being already
commissioned by the Convention to undertake there a tour of
inspection. His passports were ready, and they included a
non-existent secretary. That was the place that she should fill, if
she so decided, suitably dressed in man's attire for the purpose.
Let her take time for thought, and let him know to-morrow, when he
sought the house in the rue du Bac, how she decided. He hoped that
she would choose wisely. In the Nivernais she would be free to go
her ways, and no doubt would know how to find shelter there in her
native province and perhaps procure assistance to enable her to
quit France should she so desire it. "We are Nivernais both," he
ended by reminding her.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is compatriotism that strengthens my interest in
you." He flashed a quick glance at the door, then, at last, swept
off his hat, and bowed low. "My homage, citoyenne. I take my
leave."</p>
<p>He was gone, abruptly, giving her no time to answer, leaving her
there frowning in perplexity and buffeted between fear of death and
mistrust of her preserver.</p>
<p>That night from the height of the tribune in the hall of the
Convention, Chauvinière inveighed furiously against the prison
system, and the state of things he had found in the overcrowded
prison hospital of the Archevêché. He was superb in his audacity,
fulminating in his irony, which spared none of those responsible,
nor hesitated to indict even the Minister of Justice, Camille
Desmoulins. He claimed to speak in the name of Humanity, consumed
by the fire of a just and righteous indignation.</p>
<p>A deputy from the lower Loire ventured to interrupt him with a
gibe that drew some applause from the crowded assembly.</p>
<p>"Monsieur the President, will you permit this man to continue
his monstrous advocacy of amenities for aristocrats?"</p>
<p>Chauvinière, standing very straight, and looking very tall, his
black head thrown back, his fine hands resting, one on either side
of his plumed hat, on the ledge of the rostrum, stamped out at once
the sparks of that spluttering applause.</p>
<p>"Aristocrats?" His voice broke about the heads of the deputies
like a peal of thunder, and again: "Aristocrats?"</p>
<p>The silence was instantaneous. His indignant, questioning outcry
had caught their attention. He paused now, and his sardonic,
imperious glance sought out that daring fellow from the Loire, and
riveted him. He knew the value of suspense, and for a long moment
he held them in it. Then he loosed his answer:</p>
<p>"In a Nation of free men, Justice, citizens, should at once be
inexorable, blind, and undiscriminating. She can admit neither
prejudice nor preconception, for these indeed are the negation of
Justice. In her divine eyes, which the ancients in their wisdom
symbolically bandaged, there are neither aristocrats nor plebeians,
but only accused. And lest Justice err in her findings&mdash;a
danger revolting to enlightened men in this Age of Reason&mdash;she
must presume the accused to be innocent until her own sifting of
the evidence constrains her to convict them."</p>
<p>Applause rolled in volleys down that long hall.</p>
<p>Chauvinière, who knew so well the power of words and how to
wield them, knew also the value of dramatic poise. He remained now
calm, precise, unmoved: the complete patriot with a duty to
perform, who himself was nothing. No longer did his eyes seek out
his erstwhile interrupter, lest he be suspected of gloating over
the man's discomfiture. He did not even perceive&mdash;at least he
did not return&mdash;the approving smile of the deputy for Arras,
that notorious humanitarian, the frail and livid Maximilien
Robespierre, who removed one of the two pairs of glasses from his
uptilted nose, to beam upon the vehement tenant of the tribune.</p>
<p>After that the success of his advocacy was no longer in any
doubt. His demand that as a commencement of reform the mental cases
should instantly be removed from the Archevêché, so as to afford
the sorely needed space for other sufferers, was unanimously
supported.</p>
<p>As he descended the steps of the tribune, he reflected with
cynical amusement that the blue-green eyes of Mademoiselle de
Montsorbier were becoming responsible for internal politics in
France. But there was, he also reflected, ample precedent in
history from the days of one Helen, the shape of whose nose had
brought about the siege of Troy.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>Dumey, the middle-aged physician who controlled the madhouse in
the rue du Bac, received a visit late in the afternoon of the
following day from the deputy Chauvinière. The deputy came in a
travelling chaise, from which he removed a valise together with
himself.</p>
<p>This he set down in the doctor's private room. He came straight
to business in his peremptory, overbearing fashion.</p>
<p>"Among the demented prisoners entrusted to your care this
morning is a ci-devanty a citoyenne de Montsorbier."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes!" The plump doctor's countenance became eager. "Her
case..."</p>
<p>"Never mind her case. She is dead."</p>
<p>"Dead!" Dumey looked thunder-stricken.</p>
<p>"Isn't that why you have sent for me?"</p>
<p>"Sent for you? But I didn't send for you."</p>
<p>"You are losing your memory, Dumey. Fortunately for both of us,
I am not." His note was suddenly hard and faintly sinister, for all
its eternal mockery. "You sent for me, as the nearest responsible
member of the Government, to assure myself of the decease, and
countersign the death certificate which you are about to draw up
and sign. My own signature will be witnessed by my secretary. He
will appear presently. Now, pray conduct me to view the body."</p>
<p>Dumey looked at his visitor long and hard. There was that
between them, on the subject of which a word from Chauvinière would
send Dumey's head rolling into Sanson's basket: which was precisely
why, of all the madhouses in Paris, Chauvinière had chosen this
establishment in the rue du Bac for the reception of the patients
removed from the Archevêché. Against this danger on the one hand,
Dumey had to set, on the other, favours received from the deputy
and no doubt to be continued, one of which, indeed, was the present
flow of patients to his house and his own consequent
enrichment.</p>
<p>On both scores, whatever Chauvinière commanded, Dumey must
perform. This even to the unquestioning risking of his head, since
if he failed its removal was assured.</p>
<p>Dumey smiled at last his understanding and shrugged his
resignation. "The responsibility..." he was beginning a little
timidly.</p>
<p>"Will be mine, since I countersign your certificate. Hold your
tongue, and no question of responsibility will ever arise. There
will be no questions about any of your inmates for at least a
month. When they come, you present your certificate. It will be too
long after the event to admit of traces."</p>
<p>Dumey bowed, and conducted him. When he had unlocked the door of
a room above-stairs, he would have led the way in, but the deputy
arrested him.</p>
<p>"Wait outside, or, better still, go wait below in your room. You
will the more easily forswear yourself if you do not see your
patient again alive."</p>
<p>"But I shall have to see her. I..."</p>
<p>"You are mistaken. You will not. Go. Don't waste my time."</p>
<p>Dumey departed. Chauvinière entered the room, carrying the
valise.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de Montsorbier, forewarned of his presence by his
voice, was already standing to receive him. He bowed to her,
deferentially, and this time he was so unrepublican as to remove
his hat. Then he placed the valise on the table in
mid-apartment.</p>
<p>"You have taken your resolve, citoyenne?" he said, between
question and assertion. He had no doubt in his mind, this
psychologist, that time and thought must have brought a person of
her age to one conclusion only. It is very difficult to die
willingly at twenty.</p>
<p>"I have resolved, monsieur," she answered him with quiet
dignity.</p>
<p>"Citizen," he corrected her sharply. "There are very few
"monsieurs" left, and these are being guillotined so fast nowadays
in this country that presently there will be none at all. If you
have resolved to live and to accept my good offices, citoyenne, you
will oblige me by adopting at least the more obvious terms of our
vocabulary of Liberty."</p>
<p>He had that preciseness of delivery which is so often the
reflection of the ironical mind. Mademoiselle de Montsorbier began
to discover in it a certain elusive quality of humour, but could
not be sure whether this was conscious or unconscious, whether this
member of the Convention was intentionally ironical or merely
priggish, like so many of his colleagues.</p>
<p>She was scanning him closely now with those grave eyes of hers,
seeking in his countenance an answer to her unspoken question.</p>
<p>He smiled as if he read her thought. "And you have resolved to
live," he said. "That is very wise."</p>
<p>"I haven't said so." His penetration alarmed her a little.</p>
<p>"No? But I take so much for granted." He was apologetic. "I
assumed it from your calm, from the absence of defiance in your
reception of me. It would desolate me to learn that I am
mistaken."</p>
<p>"Mons...citizen, if I have misjudged you, I hope that you will
have the generosity to forgive me. I...I hesitate to express myself
upon your...your concern, your kindliness."</p>
<p>"Continue to hesitate. Expressions waste time, and we have none
to spare." He threw open the valise. "Here, citoyenne, are the
garments in which you will travel." He drew some of them forth. She
recoiled, her face on fire.</p>
<p>"These! These! Impossible!"</p>
<p>"Oh, not impossible. Not at all impossible. A little difficult,
perhaps. But I trust the difficulty will be overcome. If you will
study the garments, the mystery of how they should be donned and
worn will gradually vanish."</p>
<p>"That! But that is not the difficulty. You misunderstand me
purposely."</p>
<p>"In the hope of making you perceive the absurdity of your
qualms. My secretary cannot travel in a striped petticoat, and you
will find these breeches...but there! We have no time to lose. I
efface myself that you may make haste. When you are ready, you will
find me in the corridor."</p>
<p>A half-hour or so later, by when the deputy was in a ferment of
impatience, a stripling figure, in round hat, black riding-coat,
boots, and breeches, emerged from the lady's room. A moment
Chauvinière detained her, to scrutinize her with an eye that missed
no detail. Thus dressed, she looked shorter by some inches, but her
figure was well enough, and the queue of her hair had been cleverly
contrived. He approved her in a word, and hurried her below. Dumey
awaited them, his certificate prepared. That business was soon
over, and the deputy Chauvinière, with his secretary closely
following, entered the waiting chaise. Dumey closed the door upon
them, and they were driven away.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a name="pic-3" id=
"pic-3"></a><img src="1302781h-images/nuptials-3.jpg" alt=
"Illustration"></p>
<p class="caption">A stripling figure in round hat, black
riding-coat, boots and breeches, emerged from the lady's room</p>
<p>No word passed between them until they were approaching the
barrier, when Chauvinière handed his companion a bulky portfolio of
black leather, partly opening it as he did so: "The passports are
there on top. You will present them when they are demanded. It is
in your office. No need to speak."</p>
<p>They drew up before the iron gates at the end of the rue
d'Enfer.</p>
<p>An officer in a blue coat with red woollen epaulettes (gold
having been abolished as unbecoming an age of equality) pulled open
the door and peremptorily challenged the travellers.</p>
<p>"Who goes there?"</p>
<p>It was Chauvinière who from his corner drawled the answer:</p>
<p>"The citizen-deputy Chauvinière, representative en mission. Show
him the papers, Antoine, and let us get on."</p>
<p>From under his lashes he watched his companion, ready to
intervene at the first sign of blundering. But there was no such
sign. Unfalteringly she took from the portfolio the papers he had
designated, and proffered them with a hand that did not even
tremble.</p>
<p>The officer, who had put aside a good deal of his peremptoriness
upon learning with whom he had to deal, scanned the papers,
returned them, saluted stiffly, and carefully reclosed the door.
Then his voice rang out in command:</p>
<p>"Pass the citizen-representative Chauvinière."</p>
<p>The iron gates creaked open, the driver cracked his whip, the
guard presented arms, and they rolled past the barrier and were out
of Paris.</p>
<p>"We've crossed the Rubicon," said Chauvinière in his driest
tone, and flung himself back in his corner, his long, lean legs
thrust straight before him. Thus reclining he furtively continued
to observe his companion. She was composedly refolding the papers
and replacing them in the portfolio. His wonder, his admiration,
was so strong upon him that he uttered his thought aloud:</p>
<p>"My faith! But you have spirit!"</p>
<p>She snapped the lock of the portfolio, and looked at him,
smiling a little.</p>
<p>"It is in the blood," she said quietly. "You would not know
that. Hence your surprise. You will not have known many women of my
class, citizen-representative."</p>
<p>A lesser man would have been angered by the implication, which
he was not fool enough to suppose was other than deliberate. But
Chauvinière possessed that rare quality of detachment, which
permitted him to admire deftness even when exercised to wound
himself. He nodded his approval of her.</p>
<p>"I find you addicted to assumptions," he commented critically.
"That, too, will be in the blood, and the cause of much of the
shedding of it. Well, well! Let us talk of other things. My duties
take me to Nevers. This is Thursday. We should be there by Saturday
night. I don't spare horses when I travel on the business of the
Nation."</p>
<p>She had already formed a suspicion of this from the furious pace
at which the chaise was now being driven. The deputy continued:</p>
<p>"What I propose for you is this." He paused, and in that pause
she was conscious of a quickening of her pulses; a shortening of
her breath. But Chauvinière, watching her what time he deliberately
tested her by this suspense, observed only her external, unruffled
calm. Slowly he proceeded: "Had you glanced at those passports you
would have seen that their form is uncompromising. They command
all, under pain of death, to afford us every assistance in their
power on our travels in the prosecution of the Nation's business.
When we reach Nevers, I shall discover that I require precise
information of events in the extreme east of Burgundy. Too
preoccupied with affairs in the Nivernais to go myself, I shall
decide to send you instead. For that purpose, and upon the
authority of our passports, the Revolutionary Committee at Nevers
shall supply you with the necessary safe-conduct, which will take
you to the banks of the Rhone. After that, it will be for
you&mdash;and you should not find it difficult&mdash;to discover
means to cross into Switzerland, where you will be safe."</p>
<p>He ceased; but her breathing did not yet resume the normal. What
she heard seemed utterly incredible. It clearly announced him to be
acting from purely altruistic motives, with no thought of gain to
himself. Was it possible that her plight, or something in herself,
had indeed moved him to this compassionate protection? Did such
things happen, particularly at the hands of these human wolves who
had made the Revolution?</p>
<p>In consenting to take advantage of his offer, she had not
permitted herself to be deceived by the specious terms in which it
was made. She had accepted a desperate chance, who otherwise was
lost. In accepting it, she had prepared herself to depend upon her
own strength, courage, and resource, to seize and use such
opportunity as might offer to cheat him of any gain he might look
to make for himself, to ensure as far as might be possible to her
that he should perform as he seemed to promise.</p>
<p>Had she dishonoured him by these thoughts? Was this man, indeed,
the selfless friend he protested himself, labouring for her
salvation without hope of guerdon, as he had said? It seemed to her
clear mind fantastic. Yet what else was to be assumed from the
intentions he had just disclosed? Or was this merely a verbal
opiate to lull her into a false confidence, so that she might lie
the more utterly at his mercy?</p>
<p>Thus her thoughts in the long spell of silence that followed his
announcement, until at last he broke again upon them, compelling
speech.</p>
<p>"You are silent, citoyenne. You do not entirely approve of my
dispositions? Or perhaps you have a better plan, yourself?"</p>
<p>"No, no. It is not that." She paused to control the slight
tremor in her voice. In the half-light of that interior it seemed
to him that she had grown a little paler, as he considered the
sweet profile with its finely drawn lip and delicately arched nose.
"I am deeply moved, citizen, by your thought for me, which has gone
so deep in planning, by the disinterested nobility of your
concern."</p>
<p>His light eyes flickered. It was like the momentary upleaping
and instant extinction of a flame in the dark. But she was not
looking at him. She was staring straight before her.</p>
<p>"I have no words in which to thank you. I am dumb in my
gratitude and wonder. Your plan for me seems everything I could
desire. In Switzerland I have friends. I..."</p>
<p>Her voice faltered and trailed into silence. It was no pretence
that she was moved, that her self-control was slipping from her.
She was daunted by the very need to command herself, to be alert,
vigilant, and ready for emergencies which might creep up to pounce
upon her unawares. Her brave spirit, which might have preserved its
vigour in the presence of revealed danger, was being battered down
by uncertainty and suspense.</p>
<p>Chauvinière's voice, soft as silk, speaking on a sigh,
penetrated the distraction of her mind.</p>
<p>"In that case, since you so completely approve, we may consider
the matter decided, and act presently as I have said."</p>
<p>He settled himself back into his corner, closed his eyes, and
thereafter for some three hours which that journey endured he
seemed to doze. It was as if his interest in his travelling
companion were already diminishing now that the intended service
was already half-rendered and the remainder of it clearly
plotted.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>They clattered over the kidney-stones of Melun as dusk was
falling and came to draw up at the Hôtel de la Nation&mdash;lately
the Hôtel Royal. There, no sooner had a whisper gone forth from the
postboy touching the identity of our traveller, than out came
landlord, ostler, and chamberlain to welcome him in trembling
obsequiousness.</p>
<p>Chauvinière accepted this tribute to his greatness with a lofty
disdain which few despots could have equalled, none surpassed. The
best rooms were placed at the disposal of himself and his young
secretary; the best supper Melun could provide was prepared for his
august consumption; and a very choice old Burgundy was discovered
in the cellar where it had lain neglected, and brought forth for
the representative's delectation.</p>
<p>At table and thereafter his demeanour towards Mademoiselle de
Montsorbier was of a correctness which could not have been exceeded
by one of her own class. He was solicitous, but always deferential;
kindly, but never lacking in respect. And he entertained her
presently with talk which displayed unsuspected depths of culture,
acquaintance not only with the works of Scarron and Voltaire, but
also with the classical authors, whom he freely quoted. His
personality began to abash her a little, in a measure as she
discovered it so greatly to transcend all that at first she had
suspected. He displayed a refinement almost incredible in one of
his political creed; his manners were impeccable.</p>
<p>When at last she retired for the night, she went in an
uncertainty more profound than ever. He held the door for her, his
head deferentially inclined, and with a courteously expressed wish
for her good repose. Within her room, which was next to his own, a
wave of panic suddenly swept over her. She drove home the bolts
with which her door was furnished at base and summit, then went to
open her window, so as to ascertain what line of retreat might be
available in case of need. It was cold and drizzling and the night
was overcast and very dark. But light from a ground-floor window
showed her the gleaming cobbles of the yard, a good fifteen feet
below. At need with a twisted sheet she might go that way. But what
then? Such a course was only to be contemplated in desperate case,
and her case was not yet desperate. Indeed, she sought to assure
herself, she had no cause to consider it desperate at all. She was
a little coward, shuddering at shadows.</p>
<p>She was even more strongly of this opinion when she awakened in
the morning, refreshed by unbroken sleep, the spring sunshine
flooding her little white room, and realized on awakening how
needlessly imagination had made a craven of her.</p>
<p>She came spruce and trim to breakfast, so spruce and trim that a
serving-maid in the corridor gazed with a shy smile at the
citizen-representative's young secretary,</p>
<p>and may have been distressed by that austere young man's
indifference to her charms.</p>
<p>Chauvinière was already at table. As there was a servant in the
room, he did not rise. He nodded curtly, and his greeting had an
edge.</p>
<p>"Ah, Antoine! You slept well, I trust?"</p>
<p>"Excellently, I thank you, citizen-representative."</p>
<p>"In future do not sleep quite so well, if you please. I dislike
late-comers and young men who are reluctant to leave their beds.
Your breakfast is cold, and the horses are already being harnessed.
We set out in ten minutes. See that you are ready."</p>
<p>They travelled all that day at a furious rate, and with but two
halts for food and rest and change of horses, so that before
nightfall they had gone sixty miles and came to rest at
Chatillon-sur-Laing, a village of the Orleannais. Here the
experience of the previous night was repeated. Again Chauvinière
observed a deference that was almost exaggerated, again he talked
glibly and entertainingly, displaying, as it were, all the jewels
of his mind to dazzle and beglamour her. She thawed a little.
Indeed it was impossible to remain frozen in aloofness under the
glow of so much benignity. Yet once or twice, looking up suddenly,
she caught his eyes upon her. They shifted instantly, and the
wolfish expression she surprised upon his face was as instantly
covered as if by a mask. But the impression of it remained upon her
memory, to evoke a sudden ineffable dread, akin to that with which
his eyes had smitten her in the Conciergerie.</p>
<p>He drank perhaps too much that evening, and in consequence
slackened a little the reins of his self-control. For in holding
the door for her departure and in wishing her good-night, the leer
on his face and the evil glow of his eyes were unmistakable. Such
was the fear they aroused in her, that, having locked and bolted
her door, she flung herself fully dressed upon her bed, her mind in
such a state of vigilance that she scarcely slept at all until the
dawn. Yet nothing happened to justify her tremors of spirit, and
when she came to breakfast she found herself awaited by a
representative so correct and formal in his manner that she asked
herself whether again her imagination had not tricked her on the
previous night.</p>
<p>All day that question abode with her, whilst the chaise swayed
and rocked in its headlong speed, and Chauvinière half-dozed in his
corner with a disregard of her that was almost ungallant. It was
still with her when at five o'clock in the afternoon, within a
half-mile of La Charite, a village on the Loire, their journey came
to a sudden lurching end as the result of the loss of an axle-pin,
which but for the postboy's quick perception might have had more
serious consequences.</p>
<p>Chauvinière climbed down, swearing savagely. It had been his
purpose to reach Nevers that night, there to address a meeting of
the Committee of Public Safety and so to plan that upon the morrow
he might set out upon his survey. That plan he must now abandon,
and accept such a kennel as La Charite could offer his republican
sybaritism.</p>
<p>Yet, when they had tramped the half-mile of muddy road to the
village, they found there an excellent inn, where they were given a
good room above-stairs in which to sup, with a bedroom opening from
each side of it. Within an hour of their arrival an unusually good
supper was placed before them by the vintner and his comely wife,
who did not spare themselves in their endeavour to earn the
commendation of the great man from Paris by whom, in their own
words, their poor house was honoured.</p>
<p>Over the well-larded capon Chauvinière expressed himself to his
secretary.</p>
<p>"By this I should judge that there is a good deal of aristocracy
surviving in this Nivernais of yours."</p>
<p>"You should be thankful for that, since it provides you with so
good a supper."</p>
<p>"In this world, as you may come to find, the greater the cause
for thankfulness on the one hand, the greater the cause for
repining on the other. It is thus that Fortune bestows her favours:
taking payment always."</p>
<p>"The payment of a debt is no good cause for repining," she
objected.</p>
<p>He looked at her, so intently, so inscrutably, that all her
fears of yesterday evening suddenly returned, and she shivered. He
observed it.</p>
<p>"You are cold," he said, and she fancied that the shadow of a
smile swept almost imperceptibly across his lean face. "Let me
close the window." He rose, and crossed the room; and it was whilst
he stood with his back towards her, humouring the catch of the
lattice, that she suddenly took her resolve to end this suspense,
to put his intentions regarding her to an immediate test. And her
fertile mind at once supplied the necessary elements. She waited
only until he had returned to the table.</p>
<p>"You have been very good to me, incredibly good to me,
citizen."</p>
<p>He paused to stare at her, his hand upon the back of the tilted
chair.</p>
<p>"What need to speak of that?"</p>
<p>Her eyes were upon the coarsely woven tablecloth; between finger
and thumb she was kneading a little ball of crumb.</p>
<p>"I must speak of it because the time has come to thank you; to
thank you, and to part."</p>
<p>She looked up suddenly to surprise his expression and found it
compounded of suspicion, anger, and dismay.</p>
<p>"Part?" He frowned as he uttered the word. With heightened
incredulity he repeated: "Part?"</p>
<p>She explained herself. "We are already in the Nivernais. It is
my own country. I have friends throughout the province..."</p>
<p>"Friends? What friends?" His tone suggested that their mention
should be their death-warrant.</p>
<p>"I will not name them lest I compromise them. That would not be
fair to them, nor, indeed, quite fair to you. It might test your
duty too severely. Neither would it be fair to you that I accompany
you into Nevers in broad daylight to-morrow. After all, I was well
known there not so many months ago. There will be many left who
might recognize me. Seeing me in your company and thus, what could
they assume? You would be compromised and..."</p>
<p>"Compromised!" His scornful laughter shook the crazy windows.
"And who in Nevers would dare to compromise me?"</p>
<p>She smiled upon him rather wistfully, slowly nodding her fair
head. "You are of a high courage, citizen; of a reckless audacity,
as I have observed. But I will not permit you to add, to the heavy
debt under which I already lie, the risk perhaps of your
life..."</p>
<p>"Tush! No more of that, citoyenne! I run no risk. But if I did,
what then? My life is my own to risk as I choose, and not as you or
any other presumes to permit. We are free men all in this reformed
France." His tone resumed its habitual sardonic note. "And we need
no permission for our acts. All that went with the days of
tyranny."</p>
<p>"Your generosity cannot deceive me." Her blue-green eyes looked
at him resolutely. "And that is why we part to-night."</p>
<p>He leaned forward across the board. His face was very grave. It
had lost, or seemed to have lost, some of its habitual color.</p>
<p>"You give me news, citoyenne. We part to-night, eh? To-night?
So, so! And will you tell me where you are going?"</p>
<p>"I could not tell you without compromising others."</p>
<p>He laughed. "You'll compromise the whole Nivernais before ever I
let you go." The tone was fierce, snarling, as a dog snarls over a
bone that is being wrested away. But immediately almost he had
checked that too-revealing note. His voice was smooth again. "I
mean, before I let you go risk yourself in such a fashion. You'll
forgive my insistence, citoyenne. But I have not jeopardized my
neck to save yours from the guillotine just to have you throw my
gift away in sheer wantonness. Oh, no. I shall make sure of your
safety before I part with you." He sat down at last.</p>
<p>"But you said in Paris..."</p>
<p>"Never mind what I said in Paris." There was an angry rumbling
in his voice. Again it was the note of the dog about to be robbed
of the bone he had looked forward to enjoying. "Consider only what
I have said here. I do not part with you until I am assured of your
safety."</p>
<p>She sat there facing him across the board with terror in her
heart, her eyes dilating a little as they met now his smouldering
glance, observed the flush on his prominent cheek-bones, and the
scowl on that lofty brow across which a clump of his moist black
hair had fallen like a curtain.</p>
<p>She was answered. Her suspense at least, her doubts and
questionings were at an end. He was the wolf she had at first
supposed him, and she was the prey he promised himself. Why, she
wondered, did he stalk her so warily and patiently? It was not hers
to understand the man's sybaritic fastidiousness which rendered
repugnant to him the notion of prevailing without real
conquest.</p>
<p>Of her terror she permitted him to catch no glimpse. All that
was disclosed to him by her rigid stare was surprise. Then the
surprise passed, chased away by a smile, a smile of a sweetness and
gentleness such as she had never yet vouchsafed him. She averted
her eyes.</p>
<p>"Your generosity...your nobility leaves me without words. You
bring me almost to tears, citizen; tears of gratitude. And
yet..."</p>
<p>"Add nothing more," he implored her. His voice grew hoarse. "You
have yet to learn the depth of a devotion which would stop at
nothing in your service, Cléonie."</p>
<p>One of his long arms came across the table, and his fine hand
closed upon hers where it lay there beside her plate. A moment she
let it remain, loathing his touch, repressing the shudder that
might betray this loathing, and loathing herself for the duplicity
to which circumstances compelled her to descend. Then, hot with a
shame whose flush he entirely misunderstood, smiling with a rather
piteous wistfulness, she gently disengaged her hand and rose.</p>
<p>"Suffer me to go," she begged him. "I...I am a little
confused."</p>
<p>"No! Wait!" He, too, had risen, and stood eager beyond the
dividing board, to him so inopportunely placed.</p>
<p>"To-morrow!" she begged him faintly. "We will talk again
to-morrow, citizen. Let me go now! Ah, let me go!"</p>
<p>Almost she overdid it, almost she overacted the suggestion of a
spiritual struggle against the magnetism of his personality. With
another, indeed, it might have been entirely fatal. But Chauvinière
the psychologist knew the full value of restraint, knew how much
more complete is the ultimate surrender to a generous opponent. He
bowed low in silence save for a little sigh, and by the time he
came upright again he was alone. She had slipped like a ghost into
the adjacent room. He saw the white door close. He heard the bolts
rasp home. He smiled as he stood there. Then he sighed again, still
smiling; resumed his chair, and poured himself wine.</p>
<p>Behind her bolted door Mademoiselle de Montsorbier stood
breathless and a little faint. She leaned against it, listening to
his movements, and gradually she resumed her self-command.</p>
<p>She crossed at last to the dressing-table, and by the dim light
of the single candle burning there surveyed her face. She accused
it of pallor, assured herself that there was nothing to be feared,
then drawing up a chair, sat down before her mirror, but made no
attempt to prepare herself for bed.</p>
<p>Thus for a half-hour, at the end of which she heard the rasp of
his chair in the outer room, followed by the sound of his pacing to
and fro like a caged animal. Once his Steps came right up to her
door and paused there. She stiffened. She was conscious of the
roughening of her skin, of the acceleration of her pulses as she
waited through that pause, which seemed interminable, waited for
his knock. It came at last, sharply rapped, and the sound brought
her to her feet.</p>
<p>By a miracle she kept her voice steady. "Who is there?"</p>
<p>"It is I, citoyenne; Chauvinière."</p>
<p>"What do you want, citoyen?"</p>
<p>There was a long pause before his answer came: "To warn you that
we set out early in the morning. The chaise will be ready at eight
o'clock."</p>
<p>"I shall be punctual, citoyen. Goodnight!"</p>
<p>"Good-night, citoyenne."</p>
<p>His footsteps receded. Scarcely crediting her ears, she listened
to them as they crossed the length of the outer room. Then she
heard him pass into his own chamber, and at last came the closing
of his door. She was able to breathe again. But it was in vain that
she sought to explain that trivial incident. Had he deliberately
sought to scare her, merely so as to show that all fear of him was
idle and thus lull her into a sense of false security, or had his
action been genuine?</p>
<p>She crossed the room and flung herself upon the bed, fully
dressed as she was, even to her riding-boots, but she left the
candle burning and made no attempt to go to sleep.</p>
<p>With a patience and self-control that were miraculous
considering what was in her mind, she lay thus, listening and
waiting for a full two hours until she could be sure that the house
slept. Then, at last, she rose, and removed her boots. She took up
the guttering candle, and very softly withdrew the bolts of her
door. Cautiously, soundlessly, she opened it, and soundlessly crept
out into the room beyond, which now was all in darkness. A moment
she paused listening. From beyond the far door came a sound of mild
snoring. The citizen-representative was asleep.</p>
<p>With her boots in one hand and the candle held aloft in the
other she tiptoed towards the door that opened to the stairs.
Midway across the room she checked. Something gleamed lividly on a
side-table and drew her glance. It was the clasp of the
representative's portfolio. She paused, hesitating, scared by the
temptation that assailed her, to which at last, with a pale smile,
she yielded. She snatched up the portfolio and tucked it under her
arm. Then she passed out, and in her stockinged feet cautiously
descended the creaking staircase.</p>
<p>In the passage below she paused to put on her boots. Then very
carefully she drew the bolts of a side door, and stepped out into
the stable yard. Here a shock awaited her. Although it was past
midnight, a light showed in the stables; the upper half of the
stable door stood open, and above the closed lower half she beheld
the bust of a man who leaned there, who had observed her exit, and
who now straightened himself to challenge her. Instantly resolved,
she forestalled him.</p>
<p>"Ah! You are astir! It is fortunate, for otherwise I must have
fetched you from your bed. I need a horse at once, citizen."</p>
<p>"A horse? Name of a name! A horse at this hour?"</p>
<p>"Business of the Nation." The young secretary's voice was hard
and peremptory. He flourished his portfolio. "I am to ride ahead of
the citizen-representative into Nevers. There is urgency. Make
haste, or you will answer to the citizen-representative."</p>
<p>The ostler asked no more questions. A horse was quickly saddled,
and upon this the young secretary, with a seat suggestive of a
huntsman rather than a clerk, vanished at the gallop into the
night.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>The citizen-representative, newly risen, scrupulously shaved,
his hair dressed as carefully as an aristocrat's, stalked into the
main room between the bedrooms, calling briskly for chocolate.</p>
<p>Whilst he waited he sauntered to the window, and stood there
considering the greyness and drizzle of that melancholy March
morning. Presently, however, the general stillness about him smote
his attention as a sudden sound might have done at another time. He
cocked his head, listened for some movement from Mademoiselle de
Montsorbier's room. The unbroken silence moved him apprehensively.
He stepped swiftly to the door and rapped sharply with his
knuckles. There was no answer. He tried the handle. It turned, and
the door swung inwards, discovering to him the room's lack of
tenant. He crossed the threshold, and gazed about him frowning. He
noted the bed, undisturbed save by an impression of her form, so
faint as to suggest that it was some hours since she had lain
there, nor then had lain there long.</p>
<p>He stepped back, his face dark, his square chin thrust forward.
His eyes sought the side-table on which, as he remembered, he had
too carelessly and trustingly left his portfolio. It was no longer
there, which was already as he had expected. A moment yet he paused
to make sure that it was not elsewhere. Then, with an oath, he
flung headlong from the room, crashing into the serving-maid who
was bearing him his chocolate. Her scream and the clattering smash
of the scattered chocolate-service followed him as he bounded down
the stairs, bawling for the innkeeper.</p>
<p>The innkeeper, terrified by the representative's torrential
descent and tempestuous demands for his secretary, backed by
horrible threats of the guillotine in the event of prevarication or
evasion, quaveringly swore by the God of the Old Régime and the
Goddess of Reason of the new, that he knew nothing whatever of the
missing person and that he learnt now for the first time of that
person's absence. But the ostler, lounging near at hand and
overhearing the angry interrogatory, came forward to supply the
answer which was to quench Chauvinière's last lingering hope.</p>
<p>The citizen-representative stared at the mumbling oaf with such
fierce, flaming eyes that the fellow recoiled in dread.</p>
<p>"And you let him go?" said Chauvinière between his teeth. He was
smiling terribly. "You let him go? Like that?"</p>
<p>"How should I have known that..."</p>
<p>"How should you know anything, animal? Brute beast, did it not
occur to you that an honest man doesn't sneak away like a thief at
midnight?" He smothered him in obscene epithets, cuffed him in his
overpowering rage, and when the fellow protested against such
treatment in the name of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity cuffed
him again more soundly.</p>
<p>"Will you raise your voice to me, carrion? If you must be
talking, tell me at least which way he went. Use your worthless
head, animal, or you may lose it over this."</p>
<p>The ostler answered at random that the youth had ridden off in
the direction of Nevers.</p>
<p>At last Chauvinière controlled himself.</p>
<p>"Saddle me a horse," he commanded, and on that horse he was
himself riding away to Nevers within ten minutes, leaving the
postboy to follow with the chaise.</p>
<p>He rode at a pace which reflected the fury of his mind. More
even than the loss of the girl did it enrage him to think that a
man of his wit and acumen should have permitted that smoothly
spoken, lying little aristocrat to have cheated him last night with
her simpering pretence of yielding weakness, and thereby fooled him
into an exercise of idiotic patience so as to render his conquest
ultimately more complete. He was rightly served for his imbecile
forbearance. But when he found her, as find her he would, though he
destroyed a province in the search, she should mercilessly be
taught what it meant to play comedy with the emotions of such a
man.</p>
<p>He was very much the wolf that morning, the wolf questing for
the lamb that has eluded him and licking his chops in anticipation
of the voracious, unsparing feast to come when that lamb shall
eventually have been overtaken and reduced into possession.</p>
<p>He paused at Rougues to munch a crust and drink a glass of
brandy-and-water&mdash;for he had ridden away fasting from La
Charité&mdash;then spurred on again, reaching Nevers at noon.</p>
<p>He went straight to the president of the Revolutionary Committee
of Nevers, a heavy-bodied, lumbering tanner named Desjardins, and
stated his immediate need. His papers had been stolen last night at
La Charite by a youth whom he had befriended, and whom he was now
assured was a girl, a cursed aristocrat, no doubt. She was known to
have ridden off in the direction of Nevers. She might attempt to
pass herself off as Chauvinière's secretary. Her recapture was of
the utmost importance. Heads would fall if she were not retaken.
Chauvinière would see to that. Desjardins was summoned to assemble
at once the agents of the Committee of Safety, to inform them of
the case, and to stimulate them to track down the thief.</p>
<p>"And they had better be active," swore Chauvinière, "or, by
Saint Guillotine, I'll give them a lesson in zeal!"</p>
<p>With that, the representative, who was half-famished, went off
to dine at the Auberge du Soleil, whither the chaise had been
ordered to follow.</p>
<p>That the agents of the Committee were active is not to be
doubted. In fact their activities were proved by the recapture on
the morrow, near Chatillon, of the horse which the girl had ridden,
and, later, by the discovery in a ditch near Souvigny of a black
riding-coat, boots, and other articles of apparel which Chauvinière
recognized as those worn by the fugitive, as well as of an empty
portfolio of black leather with a metal clasp, which the
representative acknowledged for his own stolen property. Of the
fugitive herself, however, there was no trace. The agents inclined
to the convenient belief that she was dead, and pointed to the
clothes as evidence.</p>
<p>Chauvinière withered them with his contempt. "Women do not
undress themselves to die by the roadside, you imbeciles! Continue
the search. It will be rendered more difficult by the fact that she
has changed her apparel. But continue it. Put yourselves on the
track of any stranger of whom you may hear. Strangers do not move
unperceived in country districts. Display your zeal."</p>
<p>They returned to their quest, shrugging and grumbling among
themselves and confiding in one another that the
citizen-representative was an obstinate pig of a mule, an arrogant
bully who gave himself the airs of an aristocrat and who would come
to an evil end.</p>
<p>Days were added to those already spent, until their tale made up
a week, during which Chauvinière sat brooding at the Sign of the
Sun, snarling ill-humouredly at all who sought him, and giving,
apparently, no thought to the affairs of the Convention which were
responsible for his visit to the Nivernais. When reminded of this
by the greatly daring Desjardins, he stormed first at the audacity
of the reminder, then swore profusely by the new gods and the old
that the Nivernais should know of his presence. With that oath he
took up his neglected duties, conquering his infatuation and vain
regrets, and putting Mademoiselle de Montsorbier, at least for the
present, from his mind.</p>
<p>And as he had wrathfully promised, he performed. In that month
of April the Nivernais came to shudder at the name of a man who,
whatever he may have been in the past, had never been wanton or
crude in his cruelties, and never bloodthirsty. From township to
township he swept with the horrible paraphernalia of his
justiciary's office at his heels, and ruthlessly practised in
bloodshed the doctrines of the new Golden Age of Reason.</p>
<p>Throughout the Nivernais the Revolutionary movement had been
conducted upon moderate lines. Therefore was there the more work
for such a man in such a mood, and the more terrifying did that
work appear to the inhabitants.</p>
<p>At last towards the end of April his dread progress brought him
to the little hill-town of Poussignot. If it had trembled at the
news of his approach, it was almost prostrated with terror at the
manner of his descent upon it. A military guard of honour escorted
the travelling chaise in which he lounged in his grey coat, plumed
hat, and sash of office. In the wake of his carriage trailed a cart
laden with baulks and beams of scarlet-painted timber, presently to
be assembled into a guillotine and mounted in the market-square.
Upon the cart's grim load sat an obese, dull-eyed, phlegmatic man,
the sight of whom sent a shudder through those who guessed his
office. With him was an equally obese woman, blear-eyed, unkempt,
and slatternly, who drove the cart.</p>
<p>The Revolutionary Committee of Poussignot which had been duly
elected, upon representations from Nevers a year ago, but which had
never yet found occasion to function, was hurriedly summoned to
assemble in the little town-hall, overlooking the market-square,
where the carpenters were already busy with the erection of the
scaffold. In muttering awe they awaited the coming of this dread
man from the Convention, who was to rouse that sleepy and hitherto
contented township from its Revolutionary languor.</p>
<p>He kept them waiting a full hour while he dined, careless of the
time he thus wantonly wasted for them. He arrived at last, arrogant
and overbearing in manner, arrogant and cruelly sardonic in speech.
He found here in Poussignot a state of things which supplied ample
material for the mockery which was never very distant from his
outlook. Whilst France herself was clattering into ruin under the
revolutionary earthquake that shook her from end to end,
Poussignot, in the very heart of France, appeared to have gone to
sleep, and in its state of incredible somnolence to have pursued
the peaceful even tenor of the days of the abominable ancient
régime. It was so incredible that, after the first shock of
surprise, Chauvinière was moved to inward laughter; laughter at the
sleeper and at the thought of the awakening in store.</p>
<p>The many activities that had engaged his mind during the past
month had gradually dimmed the memory of Mademoiselle de
Montsorbier, and his chagrin at the manner in which she had
victimized him. In a measure as her image faded, so too had faded
gradually the savage humour which that memory had inspired and
which he had vented upon all and sundry. It was fortunate for
Poussignot that by the time he reached it he was growing nauseated
by bloodshed and weary of the crude pursuit of victims for the
knife. The more normal attitude of philosophy upon which he
secretly prided himself was gradually returning. His sense of
humour was gradually reasserting itself. Poussignot restored it to
him completely, although the overawed Committee, now listening to
his passionate tirade, was permitted no glimpse of this.</p>
<p>In his deep, vibrant voice, pitched on a note of stinging
sarcasm, he trounced that Revolutionary Committee, upbraiding the
supineness of its members, threatening them with the doom they had
been so reluctant to dispense unto others, unless he beheld them
more zealous in the sacred service of Liberty.</p>
<p>Having thoroughly startled them out of their complacency, having
delivered them a sermon upon the new gospel of Equality which he
gathered was insufficiently understood in the hills of Poussignot,
and having impressed them with the necessity of extirpating all
those who were heretical or lukewarm or otherwise a danger to the
spread of the glorious new religion, he passed from the general to
the particular.</p>
<p>He came already informed, it appeared, of certain things in and
about Poussignot, and he now produced a list of persons suspected
of the new crime of incivisme, in one or another of its many
forms.</p>
<p>"This list I am about to read to you; and I invite your serious
consideration of the persons whose names you are to hear. For you
are not to suppose..." And here he broke off to swing half-round
towards the window which overlooked the square where the scarlet
guillotine was in course of erection. To indicate it to them, he
flung out an arm in a gesture supremely dramatic. "You are not to
suppose that engine, that noble glaive of Freedom, that glorious
scythe of Equality, under which the heads of the despots and the
privileged have been shorn away, is being erected there merely as
an idle ornament to your town."</p>

<p class="caption">He flung out an arm in a gesture supremely
dramatic</p>
<p>They trembled, never suspecting that this terrible jester
indulged his perverted sense of humour by making a mock for his own
secret amusement of the very gospel which he was sent to preach.
There were moments when Chauvinière appeared almost to be probing
the ignoble depths to which men may be reduced by terror. More than
once had he startled his brethren in the Convention itself by
solemn fulminations in which it was almost impossible not to
suspect sarcasm, yet of which none would have dared to voice that
suspicion. One of these moments was upon him now. Inwardly his
warped soul was writhing with gleeful laughter at the psychological
humours of the situation he created by the images he evoked.</p>
<p>"I must not be understood to say that such an engine would be an
idle ornament in any town, even if a virtuous republicanism too
general to be hoped should compel it to stand idle. For, ask
yourselves, my friends, my brothers, what statue of ignoble king,
of wretched tyrant, or vile servant of despotism, what image of
sniveling saint or mouldering so-called martyr, could ever compare
with that glorious symbol of Man's Emancipation, of Man's
Deliverance from the fetters that were placed by kings and priests
upon his very-soul? There it rises, my brothers, in its awful
dignity; the emblem of the Triumph of Reason. And what more
glorious emblem could any city desire to raise? That scaffold, my
brethren, is a sacred altar, upon which it is your holy duty to
offer up the impure blood of aristocrats to the greater honour and
glory of the Republic, One and Indivisible!"</p>
<p>Under his fiery eyes they huddled together like a flock of
terrified sheep. He observed them calmly.</p>
<p>"You are silent, my friends. I understand. You share my own deep
emotion. It leaves you speechless in your great thankfulness. That
is very well. It is a sign to me that you will not falter in the
performance of the exalted duties of the office to which you have
had the honour to be elected by the voice of the people, which is
the voice of the gods." He raised the list which his left hand had
held throughout the exordium, and his tone sank quietly from its
lofty note of exaltation. "Let us come now to practical, to precise
considerations. Let me read you these names and the crimes of which
their bearers are suspected."</p>
<p>There were men on his list whom he charged with being friendly
with despots, others with being so closely related to émigrés that
their own civisme must be in doubt until thoroughly tested; others
whom he understood to be in league with reactionaries in other
parts of France; others who were thought to be in correspondence
with the enemies of France beyond her frontiers; and there were
others he named as ripe for Revolutionary justice on the score of
birth alone.</p>
<p>It was upon naming the third of these last&mdash;one Raoul
Amédée Corbigny de Corbal&mdash;that he received his first
check.</p>
<p>"Of what is he accused, that one?"</p>
<p>The question came abruptly from Doucier, the horse-leech, a man
prominent in the local Jacobin Society, and president of the
Revolutionary Committee; a passionate but entirely academic
republican, who was honest, fearless, and formidable in debate, a
man who might, had he so chosen, have represented his own section
of the Nivernais in the National Convention. He was the first, as
might have been expected, to throw off the spell of terror which
Chauvinière had imposed upon the Committee, and to shake himself
free of the net of words in which the representative had caught and
held them.</p>
<p>The emissary of the Convention was aghast at the audacious
interruption. He answered it impatiently: "He is accused of
incivisme."</p>
<p>"But in what form?" Doucier insisted.</p>
<p>"Form?" Chauvinière frowned upon him. The question was
inconvenient. He shrugged. "In the form of harbouring
counter-revolutionary sentiments." It was the best that he could
do, and it should suffice.</p>
<p>Doucier, however, proved of a disconcerting appetite for detail.
He gathered courage as he went and in a measure as he perceived
that his questions discomposed the great man from Paris.</p>
<p>"What expression is it alleged that the citizen Corbal has given
to these sentiments?"</p>
<p>"Expression!" Chauvinière's rich voice was almost shrill. "Name
of God! Do you take the risk of defending him?"</p>
<p>"When I hear precisely of what he is accused, I may consider the
necessity."</p>
<p>"But I've told you already...Name of a name!"</p>
<p>"Not precisely, citizen-representative. Not precisely. And the
Committee of Poussignot demands precise accusations; not vague
charges which of its own knowledge it perceives to be
unfounded."</p>
<p>An approving growl from the assembly informed Chauvinière that,
infected by the example of their president, the members of the
Committee had so far recovered from the spell of his oratory as to
be in a state of mutiny.</p>
<p>"Do you say that I lie?" he asked them icily.</p>
<p>"Oh! But, citizen-representative! Only that you may have been
misinformed. Unable to compile your list from personal knowledge,
we realize that you must have received assistance and advice. We
realize also, when we find in your list the name of one who is
generally esteemed, who is known to all for a true republican at
heart..."</p>
<p>Chauvinière interrupted violently. "A true republican at heart!
What next! What cant do you dare to offer me? You had better look
to your own heads, my friends, if you have learnt your duties no
better than to see a true republican in a pestilential ci-devant
aristocrat."</p>
<p>But Doucier was too well-informed to accept this as
conclusive.</p>
<p>"The two are not inconsistent. You could say the same of the
Marquis de Mirabeau, without whom there might have been no
revolution. If you will suffer us to guide you in matters of local
knowledge, citizen, you will accept our assurance that you have
been not only misled, but deliberately misled, by counsellors whose
aims are perhaps reactionary. I assure you, citizen, that the
gravest consequences might follow upon an unsubstantiated attack
upon Corbigny de Corbal. In Poussignot all the world knows the
stalwart and practical republicanism of his principles; all the
world knows the unpretentious simplicity of his existence, and all
the world loves him. That is not a man to be lightly accused. For
your own sake, citizen-representative, and for ours, you would do
well to be fully armed with particulars of Corbal's incivisme
before you demand of us his arrest and trial."</p>
<p>If the argument did not suffice to turn Chauvinière from his
purpose, at least it sufficed to make him temporize.</p>
<p>He announced that he would pay a visit to Corbal, and form at
first hand an opinion of the real sentiments of the ci-devant
vicomte.</p>
<p>Thereupon he proceeded with his list, which for the rest was
mainly concerned with priests who had declined to take the
constitutional oath, with others who, having taken it, yet refused
or neglected to adopt the constitutional forms of worship, and with
others still who, whilst conforming to all prescriptions, yet
rendered themselves suspect of insincerity by their persistent
celibacy. And when Doucier ventured the opinion that this was too
slender a ground for suspicion, he launched Chauvinière upon one of
his sinister excursions in comic philosophy.</p>
<p>"Celibacy," the representative announced, "is an affront to
Nature, and who affronts Nature affronts republicanism, which is
based on Nature's laws."</p>
<p>And upon that, catching fire from his own sententiousness, he
reverted to his earlier truculence and invective. He charged them
with lukewarmness where the interests of the Nation were concerned,
and warned them not to throw obstacles in the path of his sacred
duty, which was to uproot from the holy soil of Republican France
the last seed of incivisme which sapped the nourishment required by
the noble tree of Liberty, planted by the hand of Reason and
fertilized by the blood of patriots. He closed upon a rhetorical
exhortation, much in the same manner, that they should not compel
him to report to the Executive in Paris that he found the
Revolutionary Committee of Poussignot supine, lethargic, and
tainted with reactionary sentiments.</p>
<p>On that, perceiving that by his manner and perfervid oratory he
had reconquered much of the ground momentarily lost, he abruptly
and dramatically withdrew.</p>
<p>Of the truth of their warning about Corbigny de Corbal, of the
esteem and affection in which the man was held, he sought and
presently found abundant confirmation in the town. This irritated
him, unreasonably, perhaps. That such a thing could be at such a
time showed him how profound was the somnolence of Poussignot, how
deep a sense of complacency this little township of the Nivernais
permitted itself. All his life Chauvinière had detested
complacency. Taking, like an Intelligent man, no satisfaction in
himself, he loathed the spectacle of self-satisfaction in others,
and sought to smash it wherever he met it. He would smash it here
in Poussignot in its most confident expression, namely, in the
ci-devant Vicomte de Corbal. If civisme, as then understood, was so
wide a thing that Corbal could sit comfortable and secure within
it, then it remained for Chauvinière to discover how to narrow
civisme down to Corbal's exclusion. But because he did not wish to
set counter-revolutionary fires alight under his feet, he went
about the business with prudence. And he began his study of the
problem by paying a visit to Corbal.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>The Château de Corbal was an unpretentious, solid mansion,
perched amid vineyards halfway up the hill above the town, standing
four-square, grey, and a little dilapidated, flanked by round
towers under red extinguisher roofs.</p>
<p>Within doors, the citizen-representative found the same solid
unpretentiousness, stressed by faded decorations which should long
since have been renewed, and shabby furnishings, much of which
should long since have been burned. That this unpretentiousness
extended to Corbal's mode of life was evident when Chauvinière,
conducted to the vast stone kitchen, found him there at table with
the persons of his household, whom he simply described as his
"family." They consisted of his elderly steward Fougereot, the
latter's wife, and their two stalwart sons, and a plump comely
young woman euphoniously named Filomène, who was responsible for
the domestic comforts of the impoverished nobleman. Corbal himself,
a man of thirty, fitted into his environment as if expressly
designed for it. In dress he was almost a peasant, in dignity and
in general bearing a gentleman, whilst in speech and in
countenance, with his lofty brow and sombre, wistful eyes, he
suggested the scholar and the poet.</p>
<p>Born to an impoverished estate, he had accommodated himself
without idle repining. He had never been to Court or served his
King in any capacity; but from early adolescence he had devoted
himself to the cultivation of his three or four hundred acres,
directing and in time of need even personally assisting in sowing
and reaping, in crushing his own wine and oil, and in threshing his
own corn like the humblest metayer.</p>
<p>When the monarchy fell with the leaves in the autumn of '92, it
was said in his reproach by men of his class that he was of those
who had done nothing to uphold it, which was quite true. For when
feudalism lay agonizing and a party of neighbouring noblemen came
to summon him to his duty as they conceived it, to exhort him to
rally to his King, Monsieur Corbigny de Corbal had epitomized his
political faith in his reply:</p>
<p>"Messieurs, the King is in no danger unless it be that which you
may create for him. By resisting a nation's just demands, you rush
upon destruction. By identifying the throne with your resistance,
you will destroy the throne with yourselves."</p>
<p>These words, being widely reported, increased the respect and
affection in which he was held in the countryside. It was not for
nothing that Nature had given him those eyes, rendered wistful by
what they found in the heart of things, to which their glances
penetrated.</p>
<p>He rose now to receive his visitor, with a dignified deference
in which there was no trace of that uneasiness discernible in the
members of his household. He was of a good height and finely made,
and his self-command and courtliness were of the kind that compel
courtesy in return from all save the hopelessly boorish.
Chauvinière was not of these, and therefore he came, a little to
his own astonishment, under the spell of the ci-devant's
ingratiating personality.</p>
<p>"You take me by surprise, citizen," Corbal apologized. "It is
not so unceremoniously that I should wish to receive a
representative of the Government."</p>
<p>"I represent a Government, citizen, that dispenses with
ceremony," Chauvinière replied, but with a good deal less than his
usual haughty sententiousness.</p>
<p>"No Government should ever quite do that." Corbal's singularly
sweet smile disarmed any resentment which his disagreement might
provoke. "Governments are set up to govern; to govern successfully
they must inspire respect, and ceremony is the natural expression
of respect. Men are not humbled by deference to those things which
in themselves command it. On the contrary, they are dignified."</p>
<p>Chauvinière raised his brows despite himself. Was the ci-devant,
he wondered, permitting himself some of that covert ironic humour
in which the representative dealt so freely and with such secret
relish?</p>
<p>"A philosopher!" he said, and was not quite innocent of a
sneer.</p>
<p>"That is too big a word to describe me, citizen. I have lived
long alone; and so I have studied a good deal, to combat
loneliness. But I keep you standing. Will you not join our board?"
He placed a chair. "You will find us of a republican
simplicity."</p>
<p>"That is as it should be," said Chauvinière, who detested
republican simplicity, and daily thanked God for a revolution which
had brought the succulent things of life within his easy reach. He
sat down. He was served by Filomène with bread and ham, both of
which he found of an excellent quality, whilst Corbal himself
poured for him a wine which left little to be desired. Not so
impossibly republican, after all, this simple fare.</p>
<p>Corbal resumed his seat. "I am honoured, citizen-representative,
my poor house is honored, by the visit of so illustrious a member
of the Convention."</p>
<p>Again a suspicion that he was being mocked crossed Chauvinière's
mind. His piercing eyes were upon the ci-devant. "And you are not
at all inquisitive as to its occasion?"</p>
<p>Corbal smiled, completely at ease. "You are my guest, citizen.
It is not for me to pester you with questions. In your own good
time you shall tell me in what I may have the honour of serving
you."</p>
<p>"You are of a gratifying patience," Chauvinière commended him,
and gave his attention to the ham.</p>
<p>Thereafter Corbal and his odd guest chatted desultorily of this
and that, whilst the others sat listening in uneasy silence. At
length, the meal being ended, Chauvinière sat back, flung one
buck-skinned leg over the arm of his chair, and tucked his long
hand under the tricolour sash of office that girdled him: a man
taking his ease familiarly.</p>
<p>"You are very snug here at Corbal, citizen. I wonder that you
have never brought a mistress to it."</p>
<p>It was an idle sentence, uttered to break fresh conversational
ground. Filomène was standing behind Corbal's chair at the moment,
squarely facing Chauvinière. The sudden flicker of her eyelids, the
little spasm of pain that rippled across her plump, comely face, to
be instantly suppressed, did not escape the watchful eye of the
representative, and may have inspired the impish notion of how this
elusive ci-devant might well be hobbled.</p>
<p>Monsieur Corbigny de Corbal laughed; but it was a laugh in which
Chauvinière caught more wistfulness than mirth.</p>
<p>"What would you? I have waited perhaps too long. In earlier life
I wooed the land too assiduously. To-day..." he shrugged. "To-day
it would not be easy perhaps to find..." He checked abruptly, as
one checks on the brink of an indiscretion.</p>
<p>But the indiscretion was committed; Chauvinière had no
difficulty in completing the ci-devant's sentence. He had meant to
say that it was not easy to find a woman of his own class in a
France which had been purged of aristocrats.</p>
<p>"To find what, citizen?" he coaxed.</p>
<p>"Oh, but nothing, citizen." Corbal was faintly embarrassed. "It
does not matter. And it would be easy to discover a more
interesting topic of conversation than myself."</p>
<p>"You are mistaken in both opinions. It matters very much. And it
is precisely to talk of yourself that I am here."</p>
<p>"You desire to flatter me, citizen?"</p>
<p>Chauvinière's last doubt was now removed that the fellow had the
audacity secretly to laugh at him. But he let it pass. He had
thought of something else. The sentence with which he had rebuked
the Revolutionary Committee of Poussignot suddenly recurred to him,
and he served it up to his host.</p>
<p>"Celibacy is an affront to Nature; and who affronts Nature is no
good republican, since republicanism is based on Nature's laws.
That is why I say that it matters very much."</p>
<p>They did not take him seriously. Old Fougereot led the laugh in
which he was followed by his sons. Even Corbal smiled, whilst
Fougereot's wife slyly asked the representative if he were married
himself.</p>
<p>"I am not. But in my case there are reasons..." He stressed his
words significantly, desiring them to understand that he was quite
serious. But they laughed more heartily than ever.</p>
<p>"Oh, but the reasons, then?" the apple-faced woman demanded in
raillery.</p>
<p>"The reasons?" He glared at her. "I am wedded to my duties. They
leave no room for softer ties."</p>
<p>They began to realize that he was not jesting, and Corbal made
haste to change the subject. If Chauvinière suffered him to have
his way in this, it was because he required time in which to
consider the impishly wicked notion that had invaded his mind.</p>
<p>He was still considering it when, having concluded a visit that
in other times must have appeared oddly lacking in purpose, he took
his way slowly down the hill to Poussignot; and he smiled a
tight-lipped smile of wicked satisfaction in a notion worthy of a
psychologist and humorous philosopher such as himself.</p>
<p>"Celibacy is an affront to Nature." That was the new gospel he
was to preach, and if he knew at all the force of an idea, no
matter how crack-brained, in Revolutionary France&mdash;especially
an idea propounded by one in authority&mdash;there could be no
doubt of its success.</p>
<p>The immediate sequel proved him correct. That novel mission of
his he inaugurated upon the morrow. From the rostrum of the Jacobin
Society of Poussignot&mdash;a society founded by a handful of
hot-heads, but very languidly conducted since&mdash;to the
multitude assembled there by an invitation they were forced to
regard as a command, he propounded his gospel with the frenzied
rhetoric and specious cant with which he had learnt to sway the
passions and rouse the emotions of unintelligent, unreasoning
mobs.</p>
<p>France was being depopulated by the events. That was his
exordium. The evil brood of aristocracy which the saviours of
France had destroyed, and were still destroying, must be replaced
by a race of free men, born in an enlightened age, to make this
France&mdash;this noble, emancipated France of Liberty&mdash;great
and glorious among the nations of the earth. Replaced, too, must be
those splendid patriots who were giving their lives so freely on
the frontiers in the defence of their motherland from the invasion
of the odious hirelings of despotism. To neglect this was to
neglect the most sacred duty that the nation had the right to claim
from her children. It was to expose the Republic, through
depopulation, to ultimate destruction.</p>
<p>All this, tricked out in perfervid imagery, in phrases the more
sonorous because hollow, gradually stirred his tatterdemalion
audience to enthusiastic acclamation.</p>
<p>Having rendered them malleable, he hammered them now with that
master-phrase of his:</p>
<p>"Celibacy is an affront to Nature!"</p>
<p>Upon this theme he enlarged, expounding its moral as well as its
civic and national aspects, until, at last, perceiving that he had
completely taken his audience in the snare of his cant, he boldly
demanded of them as a proof of patriotism and sincerity that any
man who having reached the age of twenty-five remained unmarried
should be declared outside the law.</p>
<p>Thereafter he departed in great dignity, to the acclamations of
a multitude, intoxicated by his verbiage.</p>
<p>As none knew better than Chauvinière who made intellectual toys
for himself out of these things, such was the crack-brained state
of the popular mind that the more extravagant a doctrine, the more
assured it was of general acceptance. Fear, moreover, now went hand
in hand with imbecility. The guillotine began to function at last
in Poussignot, and several recalcitrant priestly heads besides some
others were shorn away. It became clear that the
citizen-representative Chauvinière was not a man with whom it would
be safe to trifle. In his wake the Terror had penetrated at last to
this peaceful township of the Nivernais. And in a feverish haste to
give proof of patriotism there was headlong rushing into matrimony
in Poussignot during the days that followed. As Chauvinière knew
from his experience of mob-psychology&mdash;there was no need for
him to push the matter beyond his address at the Jacobins'. His
crazy gospel was preached for him at street corners by unwashed
orators who a month ago would not have dared to lift their heads in
Poussignot.</p>
<p>Within ten days the movement had reached such a pitch that it
was formally proposed and unanimously agreed at the Society of
Jacobins that, as the citizen-representative had propounded, for a
man of twenty-five to remain unmarried in the face of the country's
needs was to give proof of incivisme, to be punished as incivisme
was punished by declaring him outside the law and sending him to
the guillotine.</p>
<p>The Society of Jacobins placed its resolution in the form of an
instruction before the Revolutionary Committee. But before an
instruction so eccentric, the Revolutionary Committee paused in
doubt, and sent for the citizen-representative to give them
guidance.</p>
<p>"What the people will, the gods will," declared Chauvinière. "If
this matter has been carried further than you would counsel or
desire, yet it is not for you, the humble instruments of the
People's Majesty, to withstand the People's sovereign will."</p>
<p>His superbly oracular tone and manner overawed them. Gazing upon
him and listening to him, they realized that there was no god but
the Goddess of Reason, and that Chauvinière was her prophet. There
was no debate. And thus in the Commune of Poussignot that amazing
resolution of the Jacobins was raised to the equivalent of a law.
The huissiers of the Tribunal began upon the morrow to go forth in
quest of the unmarried, to drag them before the bar, where each was
given the option of finding a wife within three days or else
submitting to conviction of incivisme, with death to follow.</p>
<p>The intransigent were few in number, and they paid the
penalty.</p>
<p>And now, at last, the ground was sufficiently prepared for an
attack upon the hitherto unassailable ci-devant Vicomte de Corbal,
and the gratification of the citizen-representative's monstrous
sense of humour. A definite accusation of incivisme, hitherto
almost impossible, was now rendered easy.</p>
<p>The accusation was laid, and Monsieur Corbigny de Corbal was
haled before the bar of the Tribunal to receive the usual
admonition.</p>
<p>To do honour to the court and the occasion, practising that
ceremony in which he believed, he had dressed himself with unusual
care, in garments stored up for ceremonious occasions: a black coat
with silver buttons, silk breeches and stockings, and buckled
shoes. His brown hair was gathered up and neatly tied in a black
silk ribbon.</p>
<p>Very dignified and self-contained he stood in the crowded
chamber of justice to hear himself admonished. When it was done, he
bowed gravely to the members of the Tribunal, and he would have
withdrawn without uttering a word, if Chauvinière had not
intervened to add something of his own to the president's formal
speech.</p>
<p>"The citizen ci-devant Vicomte de Corbal," said he, in the soft
accents of an advocate for the defence, "belongs by birth to a
class which the Republic has abolished. Himself he has gone
unscathed because of the republican spirit by which he is believed
to be inspired, because of the sentiments of liberty, equality, and
fraternity by the application of which he has rendered himself
beloved. But the time is at hand when the mere appearance of
republicanism may not suffice to efface the stigma of aristocratic
birth, and he should perceive that he is now provided with an
opportunity of placing his republicanism beyond all possibility of
future question."</p>
<p>Chauvinière paused deliberately. An utter stillness reigned in
that crowded chamber. He considered the impassive countenance of
Monsieur de Corbal and anticipated with secret amusement the
ruffling of that impassivity. He resumed:</p>
<p>"Acquainted as I am with his household, in which I have had the
honour to be entertained, I am fortunately in a position to advise
him, to point out to him that he need not be embarrassed by any
difficulties of making choice, since a bride lies ready to his
hand. I permit myself this indication because so often we overlook
that which stands nearest, and I would not have the ci-devant
vicomte suffer from any such oversight. A girl of the people who is
among those who serve him should prove domestically a very suitable
wife. Therefore this court counsels him not only to marry, but to
marry Filomène Paulard, thus not only fulfilling the requirements
of your new enactment, but also affording an abiding proof of his
acceptance of the religion of equality&mdash;a religion in which
France will tolerate no heretics."</p>
<p>The riff-raff largely composing the audience hailed the proposal
uproariously as worthy of Solomon. When that uproar died down.
Monsieur de Corbal at last spoke. A scarlet flush had overspread
his long and rather melancholy countenance. But his voice remained
calm and steady.</p>
<p>"You know..." He half-turned, so as to include the entire
assembly. "You all know my habits of life and of thought, and the
simple creed by which I have governed my existence. I believe in
communism, and I have given proofs of that belief. The Nation is
above the individual, and I recognize the Nation's right to demand
of me my property and, at need, my life. But I do not recognize the
Nation's right to demand of me my soul..."</p>
<p>Chauvinière impatiently interrupted him. "We have abolished all
that!"</p>
<p>But Corbal went on as if the interruption had not been: "Nor do
I recognize the Nation's voice in this demand. With submission,
citizen-judges, you were placed here to administer the existing
laws and not to create new ones. The making of laws is the sole
prerogative of the National Convention, and any man or group of men
infringing that prerogative and arrogating to themselves any such
legislative right are themselves guilty of an incivisme for which
they may be indicted."</p>
<p>Chauvinière admired the shrewdness and subtlety of this
counter-attack, and was thankful that it was made before men of too
low an order of intelligence to appreciate it. A growl of anger and
mockery was all it drew from the assembly, and when that subsided
the president spoke without emotion:</p>
<p>"You have three days for consideration, citizen Corbal."</p>
<p>Corbal advanced a step, betrayed out of his imperturbability.
The sudden perception that he stood before a wall of unreason,
against which intelligent argument must shatter itself in vain,
drove him to momentary madness. His eyes blazed in a face that
passion turned from red to white.</p>
<p>"Three seconds would be too much, citizen-president, for
consideration; three centuries not enough to alter my resolve to
reject this infamy."</p>
<p>And whilst the crowd surged snarling and growling, the
president, impassive as doom, insisted: "Nevertheless, you have
three days."</p>
<p>Tardily Corbal commanded himself. He reflected that further
opposition now might deprive him of even those three days, which he
would more than require so that he might set his house in order. He
resumed his habitual dignified calm, bowed once more to the court,
and took his departure.</p>
<p>"You see now," said Chauvinière quietly to the president, "what
it is worth, this republicanism of the ci-devant vicomte. A
superficial veneer underneath which we have ever the harsh,
arrogant spirit of the aristocrat, a man, in his own estimation, of
a different clay from that out of which the people are fashioned.
He burned with shame at the thought of debasing himself in an
alliance with a peasant girl. You saw that. Is that
republicanism?"</p>
<p>And Doucier, a little sadly, bowed his head. "You are right,
citizen-representative," he sighed. "It required your wit to devise
a test that should reveal the man's true nature. We have been
deceived in him."</p>
<p>Chauvinière stood up, lean and wiry, put on his plumed hat, and
adjusted his cravat. "He has his choice between Filomène and the
National Widow. Let us hope that he will prefer the little pullet,
and that she will yet redeem him into a good republican."</p>
<p>Doucier laughed. He thought the citizen-representative amusing
sometimes. The citizen-representative knew that he was amusing
always, but that it was not given to every one to have the wit to
discern it.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>At the leisurely pace of a man who meditates, Monsieur de Corbal
took his way home up the hill through the April dusk. He did not
relish the thought of dying. Even less, however, did he relish the
thought of the horrible mésalliance by which he might save his
life, which shows that Chauvinière was right and that Monsieur de
Corbal's republican sentiments were not of the proper depth. The
notion of supplying future Corbals with such an ancestress as
Filomène was entirely repulsive to him, however much he may have
esteemed Filomène in her proper place. Aristocratic sentiments,
after all, die hard.</p>
<p>He reflected that he was confronted with a choice of evils, and
he was philosopher enough to know that in such a case he must
accept the less. The futility of flight was too apparent. He would
be hunted down, and at a time when it was impossible to move openly
in the country without papers, he would soon be overtaken and
brought back in ignominy. Let him at least preserve his
self-respect. Reluctant though he might be to die, life, after all,
was not so delectable in these days, and the Hereafter, if the
priests were right, should not be without interest.</p>
<p>He mounted a stile over a wall bordering one of his meadows, and
as he leapt lightly down upon the turf, he was suddenly aware of a
figure crouching there in the gloom. A moment he stood at gaze,
then called out, challenging, whereupon the figure came upright,
detached itself from the wall, and was off at speed across the
narrow strip of meadowland towards the woods.</p>
<p>Here, thought Monsieur de Corbal, was an eccentricity of
behaviour that called for investigation. He was swift of foot, and
he was upon the fugitive before the latter had covered half the
distance to his goal. He clutched the shoulder of a stripling, clad
in the blouse, loose pantaloons, and wooden shoes of a peasant.</p>
<p>"A word with you, my friend. You are too fleet for honesty, to
say nothing of your skulking behind a wall."</p>
<p>"Let me go," snarled a boyish voice. "I have done you no harm."
The figure writhed in his grasp. "Don't dare to detain me!"</p>
<p>"Dare!" Corbal laughed. "Here's fury!"</p>
<p>There was more fury than the vicomte reckoned. Something bright
gleamed suddenly in the boy's hand. On the instant Corbal had him
in a wrestler's grip which pinned his arms helplessly to his sides.
He hugged the murderous rascal close, intending to throw him.
Instead, as if contact with that young body had burnt him, he
thrust it sharply from him, and stepped back.</p>

<p class="caption">Something bright gleamed suddenly in the boy's
hand</p>
<p>"Name of God!" he ejaculated.</p>
<p>The supposed stripling stood before him, breathing hard with
head a little bowed, making no further attempt to escape.</p>
<p>"Who are you? What are you? And why are you dressed as a man?
Answer me. I will not hurt you."</p>
<p>The sudden gentleness of his voice, more, its high-bred
inflection, wrought a change in the other's attitude. He threw back
his head, showing a face that gleamed white and ghostly in the
half-light.</p>
<p>"Who are you? What is your name?" came the counter-questions, in
a voice and delivered on a note which left Corbal little doubt of
the masquerader's quality.</p>
<p>"Until lately I was known as the Vicomte Corbigny de Corbal.
Since then I have enjoyed a certain peace as a ci-devant. At the
moment I scarcely know how to describe myself. But this land is
still mine, and that house up yonder, in which I am prepared to
afford you shelter if you will deal frankly with me."</p>
<p>"You are a gentleman!"</p>
<p>"You may call me that, I hope."</p>
<p>"A gentleman at large in France!" Almost she seemed to laugh.
"But it is a bewildering encounter."</p>
<p>"Mutually bewildering," said he. "I was not, myself, expecting
to meet a lady."</p>
<p>He heard the sharp intake of her breath.</p>
<p>"How do you know that?"</p>
<p>"How? I have my intuitions. They are not to be deceived by rude
garments and eccentric manners. I am at your service,
madame&mdash;or, is it mademoiselle?"</p>
<p>She hesitated long before passionately answering him: "Oh, if
you are a trickster, play your vile trick. It's all one to me. I am
sick and weary. I should welcome even such rest as the guillotine
brings. I am Cléonie de Montsorbier."</p>
<p>He repeated the name in accents of surprise.</p>
<p>"You are incredulous. You have heard of us in prison in Paris.
We are a Nivernais family, and there should be interest in us
hereabouts. You have heard perhaps that monsieur my father and
madame my mother have already perished on the scaffold. You may
even have heard that I was removed to a house of lunatics, but not
that I was removed thence by a Revolutionary gentleman who desired
to befriend me, because possibly that is not yet known even in
Paris. It's a long story, monsieur le vicomte."</p>
<p>"Tell it me as we walk," said he, and, taking her by the arm, he
turned her about to face the distant house whose windows glowed
ruddily in the deepening night.</p>
<p>As they went she told him briefly of her pseudo-secretaryship,
and of her escape at La Charité from her republican protector whom
she left unnamed. She had hoped to shelter at the Château de
Blesson, with her cousins there. But to her dismay on reaching it
in the dawn, she had found it closed and shuttered, the family
gone. Thence on a weary horse, she had plodded on to Vermes, ten
miles away, where another cousin dwelt. She found Vermes a
blackened ruin, and in her exhaustion and despair, she sat down
before it and gave way to tears.</p>
<p>Thus she was surprised by a group of scared peasants, a
half-dozen members of a family moving out to labour in the fields.
She staked all upon their being people not yet infected by
Revolutionary notions, and disclosed herself to them. The
disclosure increased their fear. They were folk who still believed
in God and the King; but who kept the belief secret lest it should
bring evil days upon them. Nevertheless, it was not in their simple
hearts to let a gentlewoman suffer. They gave her shelter for some
days, until beginning to fear the consequences to them of her being
discovered there, and also because to lie in hiding was too
temporary a measure to suit her impatient, eager spirit, she
procured from them the peasant garments in which she stood, and
departed, hoping to make her way on foot across the Nivernais and
Burgundy, and thence slip over the frontier into Switzerland. The
Nivernais she had almost crossed, for Poussignot was only a few
miles distant from the confines of Burgundy. But the journey had
been one of hardships beyond all that she had feared. And this
notwithstanding that Fortune had singularly befriended her. She had
made a practice of travelling only by night, never venturing upon
roads until they were deserted. By day she would sleep hidden in
some wood or buried in the straw of a barn or the hay of a stack.
Twice she had been discovered, but each time by charitably disposed
peasants, who, without suspecting her sex or quality, had given her
food and shelter. Commonly she had suffered hunger, and once at
least had been driven to steal so that she might still the pangs of
it. Once she had lost her way, and for two days travelled north
instead of east. Nor would she have known of her error but that in
the neighbourhood of Verzy she was taken ill as the result of a
drenching endured whilst endeavouring to sleep under a hedge. Here
again she owed her salvation to the charity of peasants. A farm lad
had found her staggering weakly along in prey to fever, and
accepting the risk of yielding to his invitation she had
accompanied him to his homestead, and there, since her spent
condition left her no choice, she had disclosed to the mother of
the household her sex and quality. For ten days she had remained
there recovering health and strength, sheltered, befriended, and
used with every consideration. Then she had set forth once more
upon her perilous journey. That was a week ago, since when her
progress had been slow. She had heard of the presence in the
Nivernais of the representative Chauvinière and the consequent
rousing there of Revolutionary activity. Consequently she had
deemed it more important to move with caution than with speed. She
was upon the road by which Corbal was coming from Pous-signot when
she became aware of his advance. Because it was not yet quite dark,
out of an excessive caution she had slipped over the wall to avoid
him, and thus had not only been discovered, but had been discovered
in circumstances which naturally aroused his suspicions. It was the
one error of judgment of which she had been guilty in her
travels.</p>
<p>"Yet Fortune has again befriended you," said the vicomte, moved
at once to compassion for her suffering and admiration of her
spirit. "Here at Corbal you may take a night's rest in security and
comfort."</p>
<p>"Every such night diminishes my chances of ultimate security,"
he was answered on a sigh. "It is by night that I should be on my
travels."</p>
<p>Monsieur de Corbal halted in the porch and surprised her by a
little laugh. "Faith, mademoiselle, almost you set me an
example."</p>
<p>"An example?"</p>
<p>"You suggest things..." He broke off. "No, no. I had thought of
it. It is not worth while." He pushed wide the door, and the glow
of light from within smote them with almost blinding violence.</p>
<p>"Be welcome to Corbal, mademoiselle."</p>
<p>She stepped ahead of him into the spacious and rather shabby
stone hall. He paused a moment to close and make fast the door,
then turned, and his eyes, now accustomed to the light, beheld her
clearly for the first time. Her grey blouse was stained and in
places ragged. She had doffed the shabby hat, which looked as if it
might have been filched from a scarecrow. She had cut her hair and
it hung loose and ragged now about her neck and ears, just as a
peasant lad's might hang, but the light smote from its golden sheen
an aureole about her little head, so admirably poised, and the
finely featured, high-bred face gave the lie to the tatterdemalion
rest of her.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Corbal gazed upon her lost in a rapture of wonder
such as he had never known. So intent were those sombre dark eyes
of his that at last her glance fell away before them, and she
shifted a little uncomfortably.</p>
<p>"You were saying, monsieur," quoth she, perhaps to break the
spell. "Something of an example, was it not?"</p>
<p>But still he gazed and gazed, and the natural wistfulness
deepened in his countenance. When at last he spoke, it was
cryptically, employing the old formula.</p>
<p>"<i>Moriturus te salutat</i>!" He bowed a little. "Yet it is
good to have seen you first."</p>
<p>She stared at him with closer scrutiny, startled by that
well-known Latin phrase.</p>
<p>"What do you say? Who is it that is about to die?"</p>
<p>"Are we not all in that case?" he evaded, "all who are of your
class and mine? Is not France to us as the arena to the Roman
gladiator who hailed Caesar in those words. But I keep you
standing."</p>
<p>The instincts of his blood asserting themselves, he remembered
the duties of a host and put aside all other considerations.</p>
<p>"You will require garments, mademoiselle. I will call my
housekeeper. Perhaps she may..."</p>
<p>"Ah, no!" she checked him. "Clean linen if you will. Give it me
yourself, or send it to me by a man if you wish. But for the rest,
leave me as I am, nor disclose me to be other. The citizen
Chauvinière is a thought too close for any risks."</p>
<p>"You know the citizen Chauvinière?"</p>
<p>She smiled. It was wonderful, he thought, that she should smile
so. Not to alarm him unnecessarily she evaded his question. "I have
heard of his activities."</p>
<p>He nodded. "You are wise, perhaps. Come, then, you shall have
what you need."</p>
<p>Himself he conducted her to a room above, procured for her the
linen she required, and left her, to go and inform and instruct his
household touching the presence of a peasant boy whom it pleased
him to befriend.</p>
<p>The household, openly loyal and faithful to the vicomte and
secretly faithful to the old order, treated the visitor at table
with an equality touched by deference. They had no doubt of her
quality, although it is possible that her sex remained unsuspected,
so slim was she and so boyish her voice. By her request the vicomte
called her Antoine, which was the name she had worn with
Chauvinière.</p>
<p>Deep dejection sat that night upon the little company gathered
there to supper in the great kitchen, and Filomène as she waited
upon them showed eyes that were red from weeping in a face
unusually white. They had heard the day's events before the
Revolutionary Tribunal and of the doom that now overhung their
master. Filomène herself was outraged in her every sensibility by
the offensive alternative to death which had been offered the
vicomte whom she served and worshipped.</p>
<p>Corbal alone appeared unmoved and indifferent to the sword
suspended over his head. Indeed, he was far less silent than his
wont, and there was even a touch of gaiety, of exaltation in his
bearing. He ministered solicitously to the needs of his guest, from
whose face his eyes were removed only when she showed herself too
conscious of his glance.</p>
<p>At first Mademoiselle de Montsorbier experienced a sense of
discomfort. Those great sombre eyes riveted so ecstatically upon
her evoked a memory which of all memories she desired to bury. They
reminded her of another pair of eyes that smoulderingly had
pondered her across another table, scorching her soul with the
insult of their glance. But that sense of parallel was short-lived.
The vicomte's eyes reflected wonder and a sort of ecstasy, but all
of homage. They inspired confidence, evoked a responsive
kindliness, where those other eyes had awakened only fear, and
somehow, before the meal was done, before the Fougereots and
Filomène had retired, leaving the vicomte and his guest alone, she
had the full measure of this man. She had seen in his bearing
towards his people, and their bearing towards him, his fundamental
gentleness, his engaging simplicity in externals, his true nobility
of heart, and the devotion he was capable of inspiring. The pale,
handsome face under its neatly dressed, lustrous, brown hair was
the face of a loyal, generous man, in whom no woman need hesitate
to repose her trust.</p>
<p>He took no advantage of the circumstances to seek to detain her
there alone in talk. Himself, soon after the departure of the
others, he escorted her to the chamber set apart for her. He set
down her candle, requested her commands, and withdrew after wishing
her a good rest with an austerity which left nothing to be desired,
and without so much as an attempt to kiss her finger-tips, which in
all the circumstances would have been no more than proper.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>"Mademoiselle, remain yet another day with us. The more complete
now your rest, the better speed will you make hereafter, so that
the time will not be lost."</p>
<p>Thus Monsieur de Corbal to his guest on the following
afternoon.</p>
<p>They sat in the library, whither he had earlier conducted her;
an untidy, dusty room, panelled in soiled white on all sides but
one, which was packed from floor to ceiling with serried ranks of
books. Its furnishings were handsome and as massive as anything
produced in the reign of Louis XV, but they wore, like all else in
that house, an air of dilapidation. The litter on the spacious
writing-table testified at once to a studious industry and to
negligence.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de Montsorbier, occupying a window-seat along which
was stretched one of her slim, pantalooned legs, demurred at the
proposal, expressed the opinion that she had best push on at dusk;
that, in fact, she could not think of subjecting monsieur le
vicomte to the risk of her discovery under his roof.</p>
<p>At this Monsieur de Corbal laughed with such evident amusement
as to pique her a little, for she could not conceive in what she
was ridiculous. But he did not leave her long in conjecture. He
paced the chamber as he talked, upright and handsome, looking more
like a nobleman and less like other things than usual. Not only had
he resumed to-day the ceremonious dress in which yesterday he had
attended the Tribunal&mdash;the only suit of its kind in his
wardrobe&mdash;but he had improved upon it. There was a foam of
lace at his neck, and ruffles at his wrists to veil the hands which
labour in the open had burnt brown; and he had brought out of their
neglect a pair of lacquered shoes with paste buckles and red heels,
shoes which in those days would have imperilled any man's neck.</p>
<p>He explained his laughter. "Mademoiselle, I am in the enviable
position of a man for whom risks have ceased to exist, whom fear
can no longer touch. This is Tuesday, and on Thursday next I am to
die. That is why I laugh at the notion of danger to me from
harbouring you."</p>
<p>She swung her leg from the window-seat and sat bolt upright,
confronting him, her eyes wide.</p>
<p>"Monsieur! How is this possible? You amuse yourself at my
expense! How can it be that you, who are free..."</p>
<p>"I will explain," he interrupted her, and he did so.</p>
<p>She heard his tale in growing distress and also in growing
admiration for his intrepid calm, for the almost humorous outlook
with which he viewed his desperate situation. Again she was
reminded of another whose outlook was ever humorous too. But the
difference!</p>
<p>"The beast!" she said, when he had done. "The cruel, mocking
beast!"</p>
<p>The vicomte nodded. "That describes him, I think. He is
facetiously malign. Well, well! He may have my head. But he will
not make me bow it to his humorous will."</p>
<p>Her hands twisting and untwisting between her knees in her
agitation of concern, she began to urge him to seek safety in
flight.</p>
<p>He cut her short at the very outset.</p>
<p>"I thought of it, of course. But it would be useless, and
there's a degradation in failure to which I will not expose myself.
I'll be no quarry for these Revolutionary dogs to hunt. If succumb
I must, I'll succumb in dignity, as my blood demands. You agree, I
hope, that the alternative is unthinkable; that every dead Corbal
would shudder in his grave if I were guilty of any baseness to save
my useless life?"</p>
<p>She pondered him in silence with an infinite compassion, an
infinite tenderness. She was little addicted normally to seek the
feminine relief of tears. Yet now it was only by an effort of will
that she repressed them.</p>
<p>"Is there," she asked after a moment, "no third course possible?
Have you thought well, monsieur?"</p>
<p>Perhaps more of her tender concern escaped in her voice than she
intended. He halted before her, and his dark, solemn eyes
considered her. The pallor deepened in his face as if he were
suddenly beset by fear, and a deeper wistfulness crept into the
lines of it. At last, very slowly, he answered her.</p>
<p>"Yes, I have thought. And a third course does offer. But..." He
broke off with a little gesture of despair.</p>
<p>"But what, monsieur? Express it freely. It is the way to test a
thought."</p>
<p>"You know that, too! How wise you are!" Admiration flashed in
his eyes. "The thing, however, is not in need of the test of
expression. I hesitate only from the fear of being
misunderstood."</p>
<p>She almost smiled as she looked up at him. "To a man in your
case can it matter to be misunderstood? And misunderstood by whom?
By me? For what does my opinion count in this?"</p>
<p>"For everything." he answered, and set her staring and a little
breathless, stirred by something quite indefinable.</p>
<p>He swung away from her abruptly, paced to the book-lined wall,
and back again, with bowed head, to come to a halt once more before
her.</p>
<p>"I may be suspected of having found here no more than something
to supply my need. That is my great fear. Will you believe me,
mademoiselle, if I swear that I shall utter no word that is not
true? I am a man in his last hours. There may be little good in me;
but never in life have I soiled myself by falsehood."</p>
<p>"That is how I should judge you, monsieur. Speak freely,
then."</p>
<p>He spoke, but not freely. He faltered and stumbled awkwardly in
a manner utterly unusual to him, whose utterance normally was
precise and scholarly.</p>
<p>"You will not see, mademoiselle, I beseech you, a lack of...of
homage in what I am to say. In other circumstances...But here time
presses. I am a man who has lived much alone. My books and my land
have been my only concerns, and my little family almost my only
company in years. It is this aloofness from the world which has
made possible my survival until now. Many things that make up the
life of my kind have passed me by. I have not missed them, because
I have not desired them. No woman...I beg you to believe me...no
woman has ever touched my life. Until now."</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de Montsorbier stiffened. She was very white, and
the grey woollen smock shuddered under the heave of her slight
breasts. The vicomte paused there, watching her almost in fear, he
who had contemplated death with such tranquillity. He clasped his
hands in his nervousness and found them moist.</p>
<p>"I...I have read the poets, of course. Yet I do not know how
these things come to a man. I know only that love has come to me
like a lightning stroke out of heaven. Bear with me, mademoiselle,
though I may seem to you outrageous. Doubt what you will, but not
my truth and sincerity."</p>
<p>Again he paused. But still she said nothing. Of the two it would
have been hard to say which was possessed by the deeper fear.</p>
<p>"When first I saw you there in the light last night, it seemed
to me...as if my soul leapt from me to embrace your soul. I utter
crudities, perhaps. I can express it in no other way. But so
spontaneous, so...so inevitable was this thing, that it has seemed
to me...It is not a presumption, mademoiselle. It is an instinct, I
think. It has seemed to me that something reciprocal, something
mutual must have taken place. It seemed impossible that a man's
spirit could...experience so much...unsupported.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle, I am ashamed of my poor words. They do
not..."</p>
<p>She interrupted him at last. She had risen, and, unbelievable
miracle as it seemed to him, her breast was leaning on his own, her
face, all white, and piteous was upturned to him.</p>
<p>"Ashamed!" she cried. "Ashamed!"</p>
<p>There was a music of tenderness in her voice that dazed his
senses. "Your words leave nothing unsaid. Nothing that is not true,
at least. Your instincts were at no fault, my dear."</p>
<p>His arms went round her. His voice was the voice of a man in
pain.</p>
<p>"Love is the fulfilment of every living thing, and I might have
died unfulfilled if you had not come to me at the eleventh
hour."</p>
<p>She shuddered. "Oh, my dear!" She lay faint against him.</p>
<p>"Ah! But all that is changed," he cried, to hearten her. "You
make life possible. If I had been mistaken, if you had not cared,
nothing further would have mattered. I should still have died the
richer, the nobler for what you brought me. But since you
care...Listen, my dear. The decree of the Revolutionary Tribunal is
only that I marry. So that I marry within three days I fulfill the
requirements of this grotesque mockery which they call a law.
Filomène was proposed to me, because I would make no choice for
myself. But Filomène or another, it is all one to them. If you,
then, come with me before the Tribunal, in peasant dress&mdash;that
will be safer&mdash;as a girl whom I prefer, whom I have chosen for
myself...We can invent your place of origin. That will not be
difficult. If, then..."</p>
<p>She broke away from him, and stepped back. "Oh, you don't know
what you are saying!" she cried out in deep distress.</p>
<p>He stood crestfallen, his soaring hopes all checked.</p>
<p>"But if...if...we love each other?" he faltered. "What
difficulty, then? Need the notion of an immediate marriage be so
repugnant?"</p>
<p>"It isn't that! It isn't that!"</p>
<p>"What then?"</p>
<p>She laughed without mirth. The situation, after all, was not
without mirthless humour.</p>
<p>"Chauvinière!" she said significantly.</p>
<p>"Chauvinière?" he echoed, misunderstanding her, of course. "What
of him, then? Even Chauvinière will be silenced since his demand
that I marry will be satisfied. He named Filomène as the only bride
at hand. But one woman will do as well as another for him; or, if
not for him, at least for the Tribunal. So that I obey the decree,
they can hardly compel me in the matter of my choice. That were too
dangerous a precedent."</p>
<p>"What you say would be true in the case of any woman but
myself."</p>
<p>"But yourself?" He gazed bewildered.</p>
<p>"Because I am the one woman of whom Chauvinière will not permit
you to make choice. It is sadly, cruelly ironical, my friend. If
you disclose me, you merely destroy me with yourself."</p>
<p>"If I disclose you as Mademoiselle de Montsorbier. But that is
not the intention. As a peasant, a girl of the people..."</p>
<p>She interrupted him, to make all plain at last.</p>
<p>"That might serve for the others. But not for Chauvinière.
Chauvinière was the deputy who smuggled me out of Paris."</p>
<p>It was a long moment before he completely understood, and
understanding brought a curious horror. "It was he? It was
he...?"</p>
<p>She nodded, her little features twisted in a bitter smile.</p>
<p>He shuddered, and put his hands to his face to shut out the
picture which the sight of her now evoked. He stepped back, and sat
down abruptly in a chair. He groaned as he sat there, and at first
she misunderstood the source of his pain, imagined it to lie only
in the sudden sense of defeat which her disclosure brought him. But
his words enlightened her.</p>
<p>"Chauvinière!" he muttered. "That ineffable beast! His foul eyes
crawling over your purity and grace!" He set his teeth. "That he
should have dared! That he should have soiled you by his
glance!"</p>
<p>"My dear, is it worth while to think of that? At such a
moment?"</p>
<p>"What else is there to think of? What else can matter by
comparison? My life!" he laughed. "I would give it freely to have
spared you!"</p>
<p>There was a tap at the door. Filomène came in with a scared
countenance. "It is the citizen-representative," she announced. "He
is here. He asks to see you."</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de Montsorbier shrank back in fear.</p>
<p>Corbal uncovered his face, and came slowly to his feet.</p>
<p>"The citizen-representative?" he questioned dully.
"Chauvinière?" Then, abruptly, he cast off his dejection. He
squared his shoulders and stood stiff and straight, his face alight
with purpose. Mademoiselle de Montsorbier, observing him, instead
of distress beheld in him only a preternatural calm. And when
presently he spoke again, not only had his voice resumed its
natural level tone, but it was faintly charged with a note that was
almost derisive.</p>
<p>"The citizen-representative Chauvinière, eh? Is he alone?"</p>
<p>"Yes, monsieur. I saw no one else."</p>
<p>The vicomte nodded. He was smiling. "But how very good. How very
condescending of the citizen-representative to honour my house
again! And so very opportunely! Almost it is as if he had guessed
my need to see him, and desired to spare me the trouble of going in
quest of him. Let him wait a moment or two in the hall, Filomène.
Detain him there if you can. Then bring him in."</p>
<p>Between surprise and relief at the vicomte's manner, Filomène
departed.</p>
<p>Before she was out of the room, Corbal was at a tall cupboard of
polished mulberry that stood against the wall. He found
Mademoiselle de Montsorbier at his elbow.</p>
<p>"Will you hide me in there?"</p>
<p>He lost a second in staring at her. Then he smiled and shook his
head. "I have no thought to hide you." He took a mahogany case from
a shelf in the cupboard.</p>
<p>"But if he finds me here!"</p>
<p>"It is what I desire." He took up a powder horn and a little
linen bag, and closed the door of the cupboard. "The confident,
overbearing fool!"</p>
<p>He crossed to his writing-table, and opened the box. It
contained a brace of duelling pistols bedded in its red velvet
lining.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>Filomène had her attractions, and a man of so enterprising a
nature as the citizen-representative does not allow feminine
attractions to go unheeded.</p>
<p>When she returned to him where he waited in the hall, he took
her softly rounded chin in his lean hand and considered her
approvingly. His words, however, suggested that he did so
dispassionately, in a spirit of critical detachment.</p>
<p>"Does he perceive your graces yet, my dear, this fastidious
ci-devant? Faith, in his place, I should not wait to be bidden
twice. I'll make a ci-devant vicomtesse of you yet," he promised,
and kissed her by way of sealing the bargain. Detachment, after
all, may be pushed too far; and he had a way with him, the
citizen-representative Chauvinière.</p>
<p>He released her chin and bade her conduct him to the reluctant
bridegroom. But Filomène remembered her orders to detain him, and
he, himself, had afforded her the pretext. More than this, it was
suddenly revealed to her how she might even save the vicomte for
whom her affection was of the exalted kind that desires to express
itself only in service.</p>
<p>"It's not only the bridegroom who is reluctant," said she, her
winsome face grown sullen. "You make very free with a poor girl,
you gentlemen of the Revolutionary Tribunal. You bid a man marry me
without so much as a 'by-your-leave' to me. You take it for granted
that I've no mind in the matter. 'Marry Filomène on Thursday, or we
guillotine you on Friday.'" She sniffed her angry scorn. "You think
that's all there is to it. And what if Filomène doesn't want the
man you order to become her husband?"</p>
<p>Chauvinière was scowling at her. He remembered the soft glances
he had seen her bestow upon Corbal, which had first suggested to
him the course he had taken. His scowl became a smile of
mockery.</p>
<p>"What game do you play with me, my girl?"</p>
<p>"No game, citizen-representative. It's deadly earnest as you and
your Tribunal will discover. I'm not to be handed over like a cow
or a sheep, and I don't belong to you to be bestowed by you.
Liberty, eh? That's your notion of Liberty, is it? Why, the
aristocrats would never have dared so much, and you'll not dare it
where I'm concerned."</p>
<p>"But of course not, if you say so."</p>
<p>"I do say so." Her voice grew shrill. She had wrought herself
into a fine mimic passion. "You'd better understand me clearly, and
save yourselves the trouble of pushing this imbecile business any
further. I do not take a husband at your bidding, and certainly not
the citizen Corbal. I refuse to marry."</p>
<p>Chauvinière was smiling tolerantly upon the vehemence.</p>
<p>"You do?" quoth he.</p>
<p>"Flatly," she announced, not without a flash of exultation,
conceiving that thus she had checkmated Chauvinière and saved her
beloved vicomte from the peril that assailed him.</p>
<p>Chauvinière, still smiling, fetched a sigh. "A pity!" he said.
"A thousand pities! He will now, if he wishes to live, have to find
some one for himself; and I cannot hope that he will find any one
half so agreeable." He sighed again, inwardly relishing the joke.
"Now lead me to him, if you please."</p>
<p>Filomène shrank back, aghast to find her weapons so easily
shivered. She choked down her tears of rage, eyeing the
citizen-representative with a malevolence that but increased his
secret mirth.</p>
<p>Then, nothing else being left to do, she conducted him in
silence and announced him to the waiting vicomte. Lithe and active
in his long grey coat, tricolour sash from which a sabre now
dangled, and cockaded plumed hat which he did not trouble to
remove, Chauvinière swaggered into the library. Within the
threshold he halted, irony in every line of him, to survey the
vicomte, who with hands behind him stood placidly by the empty
fireplace. He jerked a thumb after the retreating Filomène.</p>
<p>"A juicy pullet, my friend; not to be boggled over by a man of
taste."</p>
<p>"Perhaps I am not a man of taste&mdash;by Revolutionary
canons."</p>
<p>"In your own interests I hope you'll prove so. You've offended
the child by your reluctance, and she declares that you shall not
marry her now if you would. But that's to be overcome by a little
persuasive wooing. In your place, I should offer it. You'll find
her arms warmer about your neck than the collar of the guillotine.
But it's for you to choose between maid and widow."</p>
<p>"You repeat yourself, citizen. Is that the only purpose of your
visit."</p>
<p>Chauvinière's light eyes drew narrow. Here was one who dealt in
a mockery that was deadlier than his own and just as elusive.</p>
<p>"You misapprehend me." His tone was dry and crisp. "It is the
fault of your class to want for understanding. It is the emptiness
of aristocrat heads that has brought so many of them to the basket.
I am here, my dear ci-devant, to exhort you in the fraternal
spirit..."</p>
<p>He broke off. A slight movement in the corner on his right drew
his glance aside, to discover there a slim lad in peasant blouse
and pantaloons.</p>
<p>"Why? Who's this that..." Again he checked a sudden quickening
in his glance. He leaned forward, staring hard; took a short step,
and stepped again. Then an oath of amazement escaped him, and on
the heels of that a laugh, loud and full of relish. "Why, here's a
meeting!" He swept off his hat. "It becomes necessary to uncover."
He bowed. "And how long may you have been at Corbal, my dear
secretary?"</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de Montsorbier came forward a little, miraculously
preserving her composure.</p>
<p>"Since last night, citizen," she answered simply, so simply and
calmly that it staggered him.</p>
<p>"Oh, since last night, citizen!" he mimicked her. "Since last
night, eh? Name of a name! I find more at Corbal than I should have
dreamed of seeking. Life is full of surprises. But they are seldom
as pleasant." He moved to advance towards her.</p>
<p>"Stand where you are!"</p>
<p>It was Corbal who spoke, in a cold, crisp tone that effectively
arrested the representative. He stiffened as he confronted the
vicomte across half the room.</p>
<p>"Life is full of surprises, as you say, citizen-representative.
This one may not prove quite so pleasant as you are supposing."</p>
<p>There was in the vicomte's attitude, in his very calm, something
sinister and menacing.</p>
<p>Instantly Chauvinière scented danger and as instantly would he
have forestalled it; but he was hampered and undone by the mockery
in which he dealt so lavishly. His absurd gesture of
mock-deference, cumbered now his right hand with his doffed hat.
Before he could slip that hand into his bosom to pluck thence the
pistol which he carried ready for just such emergencies, it was
necessary to be rid of the hat. He tucked it swiftly under his left
arm. But he got no farther.</p>
<p>His movement was the danger signal to Corbal, and Corbal now
covered him with a heavy duelling pistol, steadied upon his left
forearm.</p>
<p>"Move a finger, citizen-representative, and I'll dispatch you
into hell."</p>
<p>Chauvinière obeyed, but none too literally. He planted his feet
wide, and folded his hands behind him. Then he laughed. He seemed
entirely unperturbed, dissembling by an easy bearing the
watchfulness of those light eyes of his.</p>
<p>"Surprise upon surprise!" said he. "And this from you, my dear
ci-devant! I was far, indeed, from expecting it of you. Hitherto
you have been of so charming and unfailing a courtesy that I should
never have thought you capable of such a grossness. Why should you
desire to intimidate me?"</p>
<p>"You misapprehend me. I am not proposing to intimidate you."</p>
<p>"What then?"</p>
<p>"To kill you."</p>
<p>Again Chauvinière laughed, although he paled a little under his
tan.</p>
<p>"But what words! Come, citizen: let us be practical. How can my
death serve you? Will it, do you suppose, save you from the
obligation of complying with the decree of the Revolutionary
Tribunal, or, in the alternative, of leaving your head on the
guillotine? A little reflection, my friend, will show you that it
will merely precipitate your doom."</p>
<p>The vicomte remained unperturbed. "And a little reflection on
your side will show you that my life being already forfeit, I can
lose nothing by killing you."</p>
<p>"But an act of such puerile and fruitless vindictiveness!"
Chauvinière seemed shocked and hurt. "Besides, my friend, I have
two men with me, out there. If you imagine that to shoot me will
afford you a chance of escape, you are wrong. The sound of the shot
will bring in my men, and that will be the end of you."</p>
<p>"If that were true&mdash;which I know it not to be&mdash;the
intervention would still come too late to prevent the end of you.
And Mademoiselle de Montsorbier, at least, will have been made
safe. Also you will have expiated the unforgivable presumption
which led you to raise your rascal's eyes to her. You son of a dog!
You gutter-begotten rogue! Your very glance has been a defilement
to her. A slug crawling over the white purity of a lily's
petal."</p>
<p>"We become lyrical!" said Chauvinière, but there was a snarl in
his voice, for inwardly his arrogant soul was writhing under the
lash of the nobleman's contemptuous insults. "I understand, I
think. Well, well, you have me at a disadvantage. I must make
terms, I suppose."</p>
<p>"There are no terms to be made. It but remains that you give the
only payment you can afford."</p>
<p>"You mean that you intend to murder me in cold blood! It is
inconceivable. After all, you are a gentleman, not an assassin."
There was no mockery now in Chauvinière's voice. It was warmly
earnest. "At least, let us exchange shots, here in this
room&mdash;at ten paces, or any distance that you please elsewhere.
You cannot do less than that."</p>
<p>Monsieur de Corbal resumed his urbanity. "I am desolated to
refuse you even that. If it were a question only of myself, of my
own life and liberty, I would accede gladly. Indeed, I doubt if I
should be at even so much trouble to preserve them. But there is
Mademoiselle de Montsorbier. I cannot allow either her fate or the
punishment of the insult your attentions have put upon her to lie
at the mercy of luck or marksmanship."</p>
<p>Chauvinière's face had turned grey. "I am to be murdered,
then?"</p>
<p>"Not murdered. Executed."</p>
<p>"A fine distinction!"</p>
<p>"You have dealt a little freely yourself in fine distinctions
where the anguish of others was concerned. It is just that a man
should sometimes drink as he has poured." The vicomte's cold
sternness left little doubt of the measure of his resolve. Without
moving his eyes from Chauvinière, he spoke to Mademoiselle de
Montsorbier. "Mademoiselle, may I beg you to withdraw?"</p>
<p>"My God!" broke in a groan from the representative's bloodless
lips, his arrogant spirit now subdued entirely. Only the vicomte's
fixed stare and the conviction that his least movement must hasten
the approaching doom prevented him from taking the chance of
reaching for that pistol in his bosom. Though fear might have him
now in an icy grip, yet his wits retained their clarity. To the
last second he would wait and watch for his opportunity. Therefore
was he still careful to do nothing to precipitate an end that might
yet be averted.</p>
<p>"If you please, mademoiselle!" the vicomte repeated almost
peremptorily, for mademoiselle had made no movement to obey
him.</p>
<p>She moved at last, but not to depart.</p>
<p>"A moment, please," she said. She strove with her agitation.
"Let us be practical, as the citizen-representative himself began
by suggesting."</p>
<p>Touched though she might be by the terrible intransigent demands
of the vicomte's devotion, she realized the futility of sacrificing
a chance of escape and safety, which she dimly perceived, to the
exploitation of a romantic vindictiveness. She saw more clearly and
farther than the vicomte. She had less resentment to blind her. To
be desired by a man, however unworthy, can never be quite so
unpardonable an offence in the eyes of a woman as in those of her
accepted lover. Therefore her thirst for Chauvinière's blood was
less fierce than the vicomte's. It might go unslaked so that his
life should serve them better than his death.</p>
<p>Calmly now she expounded her proposals.</p>
<p>"The citizen-representative spoke just now of making terms. Let
him write three lines, informing the Revolutionary Tribunal of
Poussignot that he has found it necessary suddenly to pay a visit
to Nevers, which will keep him absent until to-morrow. After that,
let him consent to be confined here for twenty-four hours, so as to
give us that measure of start in our escape. Those are the terms on
which you will, no doubt, agree, Vicomte, to spare his life."</p>
<p>The vicomte's face darkened. "I should prefer..."</p>
<p>She interrupted him, her tone persuasively insistent. "I have
told you, my friend, what I desire. It is, believe me, better,
safer so; nor do I want you to soil your hands unnecessarily."</p>
<p>If he yielded grudgingly, at least he wasted no words.</p>
<p>"It is for you to command. Be it so. You have heard
mademoiselle's proposal, citizen. What do you say?"</p>
<p>Chauvinière breathed more freely. The tide of his courage flowed
again, bringing with it at once a resumption of his normal manner.
If he accepted this chance of life, he certainly should not be
suspected of snatching at it.</p>
<p>He took now his time in answering, let It be seen that he
pondered the proposal in dignified calm.</p>
<p>"As I have already said, you have me at a disadvantage." He
shrugged. "I must therefore capitulate on the terms you offer. But
I'll first require some guarantee that when I have fulfilled my
part, you will not fail to perform yours."</p>
<p>"My word is your guarantee," said Corbal curtly.</p>
<p>Chauvinière pursed his lips. "A little meagre," he
deprecated.</p>
<p>"It has never yet been so accounted. And only a fellow of your
own base origin. Ignorant of the ways of men of honour, could
suppose it."</p>
<p>Chauvinière looked at him, and sneered. "It Is evidently among
the ways of men of honour to insult the man at whose head you hold
a pistol. That is noble. That inspires confidence. That assures one
that the word of such a man is a sufficient guarantee of anything!"
He was bitterly derisive. "But I must take my chance of your
keeping faith. I see that plainly. Tell me this, at least: When you
have departed, and the twenty-four hours shall have come to an end,
who is to restore me to liberty?"</p>
<p>"I shall arrange for that."</p>
<p>"You'll forgive my importunity in desiring to know something of
those arrangements before I surrender completely to your wishes.
You'll realize my reluctance to be left to starve in the cellar
into which you'll lock me if you should forget, or find it
difficult, to take the necessary steps to procure my release."</p>
<p>It was mademoiselle who answered him. "At this hour to-morrow
the key of your prison shall be delivered to the president of the
Revolutionary Committee, together with a note containing the
information necessary to procure your enlargement."</p>
<p>He inclined his head. "That will do excellently, of course. But
who will carry the key and the note?"</p>
<p>"You may depend upon us to find a messenger, wherever we may be.
There is no difficulty in that."</p>
<p>"But messengers are sometimes unreliable. If this one should
delay or neglect entirely to discharge his errand?"</p>
<p>"We shall do our best to procure a messenger entirely
trustworthy, and we shall assure him of a handsome reward at your
hands to quicken his zeal. That is the utmost we can do. The rest
is your risk."</p>
<p>He shrugged and spread his hands. "I must accept it, I suppose.
You leave me little choice."</p>
<p>"About it, then," Corbal commanded him. "Write your note here.
You will find quills, ink, and paper."</p>
<p>Chauvinière stepped forward as he was bidden, drew up a chair
and sat down at the writing-table, across which the vicomte faced
him with his ever-levelled pistol.</p>
<p>His pen scratched industriously for some moments, but not half
so industriously as his nimble rascally wits, seeking for him a way
out of this trap, a way of breaking faith and turning the tables on
these two who made a mock of him.</p>
<p>At last he signed with a flourish, flung down the pen, and rose.
He took up the note and thrust it under the eyes of Monsieur de
Corbal at close quarters; at such close quarters that his left hand
which held it was not more than three inches from the vicomte's
right with its levelled pistol.</p>
<p>"Read for yourself," he said harshly.</p>
<p>Momentarily Monsieur de Corbal's glance was lowered to read. But
in that moment the sheet waved and fell away under his eyes; and
before he realized what was happening, the fingers of the hand
which had held it had pounced upon his wrist and their paralyzing
grip was bending it aside so that the vicomte's weapon was now
harmlessly deflected.</p>
<p>He saw the representative's right hand slide into the bosom of
his broad-lapelled coat for the pistol which he kept here, and
heard the representative's mocking voice.</p>
<p>"I take this trick, I think, my dear ci-devant. Opportunity
never fails the man who knows how to seize it."</p>
<p>And his laughter rang out clear and sharp to be suddenly lost in
the report of a shot which filled the room with its
reverberations.</p>
<p>Chauvinière choked on his laugh, loosed his hold of the
vicomte's wrist and reeled backwards, whilst the pistol which he
had been in the act of drawing dropped from his nerveless grasp. He
brought up with his shoulders to the wall, pressing to his left
side a hand which grew red almost at once with the blood oozing
between the fingers.</p>
<p>Steadying himself there, his features twisted into a spasmodic
grin. He attempted to speak; but broke into a cough, with the acrid
taste of powder-smoke in his throat and nostrils. The cough
deepened. It became a frantic effort to clear his lungs so that he
might breathe, and a foam of blood appeared upon his lips. He
writhed yet an instant, his limbs twitched convulsively, and
finally he slid down the panelled wall into a quiet heap from which
his knees protruded sharply.</p>
<p>It had all happened so quickly that the vicomte had never moved
from his place beyond the table, nor mademoiselle from the other
end of the room, where she stood staring white-faced upon her work,
the pistol still smoking in her hand.</p>
<p>It is curious that the first thing calling for comment from
Monsieur de Corbal should have been the least important.</p>
<p>"Death caught him with laughter on his lips," he said on a note
of horror.</p>
<p>"I seem to remember," said mademoiselle, "that once he predicted
something of the kind for himself." Her voice was oddly
strained.</p>
<p>The vicomte pursued his train of thought.</p>
<p>"He might be laughing still, and with good reason, if you had
not insisted upon taking the second pistol for your own possible
emergencies. I never dreamed that the emergency would be mine. You
were only just in time, Cléonie. Already I was looking in the face
of death."</p>
<p>"That," she answered unsteadily, "was my only justification."
She shuddered, let her pistol fall to the ground at last, covered
her face with her hands, and fell to sobbing convulsively.</p>
<p>Instantly the vicomte was at her side, his arms round her slim
shoulders, his head bending to hers, his voice soothing and
heartening her. Thus he drew her from the room, closing the door
upon the thing it contained, and out into the hall, where Filomène
with a scared face awaited them.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>Seated out there in the chill gloom of the hall, on a
high-backed wooden settle ranged against the grey wall,
Mademoiselle de Montsorbier presently recovered command of
herself.</p>
<p>She looked from Filomène, who, without illusions now on the
score of her sex, knelt at her feet, chafing one of her hands, to
Monsieur de Corbal, who leaned over her in a solicitude that made
him momentarily oblivious of all else.</p>
<p>"My friend, forgive this weakness, it is not the time to yield
to it. Tears are a luxury for those who are secure." She dried her
eyes. "We are in grave peril, now, and it will need all our
resource to win out of it."</p>
<p>But Monsieur de Corbal smiled confidently. "Your resource has
already provided for that, my dear. The note which you made him
write to the members of the Tribunal will sufficiently explain his
absence, whilst his removal raises the only obstacle to...to the
nuptials which are required of me, provided that...that you..."</p>
<p>She interrupted him, raising her eyes to his, a wan smile on her
white face. "You may take that for granted now, Raoul."</p>
<p>"Then let us lose no time. Filomène will find you such garments
as you need, and we'll present ourselves to the Tribunal at once.
Its members are all friendly towards me in themselves. It was only
Chauvinière's influence and the fear of him which stiffened them
against me in the matter of these Revolutionary nuptials. In
Chauvinière's absence they'll be willing enough to let me choose my
own bride so that I comply with the decree. Indeed, not Chauvinière
himself could have pushed matters so far as to constrain my choice
of a wife, so long as I was willing to take one, especially if she
were of humble origin as you'll pretend to be. Come, then. We'll
invent the origin, together with a name for you, as we go."</p>
<p>"How you run on!" she said, and almost laughed for all her
heart-sickness and abiding horror of the thing so lately done.</p>
<p>"It is necessary. Time presses. Come."</p>
<p>"Wait! Wait!" She was imperative. "Do not let haste drive us
into rashness. Consider first what must follow. Chauvinière's note
will satisfy the Tribunal now, no doubt. But for how long? In a day
or two there will be questions..."</p>
<p>He broke in upon her fears. "You do not know Poussignot. I do. I
have lived here all my days. Trust my judgment in this.
Chauvinière's presence has been a nightmare upon the place. His
absence will bring relief, a reaction to the normal which will
steadily grow whilst that absence is protracted. Very soon
Poussignot's concern only will be lest Chauvinière should return.
Poussignot will do nothing to encourage that, and will rest content
so long as it does not occur."</p>
<p>"You are very confident."</p>
<p>"I have cause to be."</p>
<p>He was persuading her.</p>
<p>"And the note?" she asked. "How will you convey it to the
Tribunal?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I've thought of that, too. The ostler at the inn where
Chauvinière lodges is my man Fougereot's nephew, a Godfearing lad
to whom all sans-culottes are detestable. Fougereot will convey the
note to him, and he will deliver it: a natural enough
messenger."</p>
<p>Her face brightened at last. "You've thought of everything," she
approved him. "Chauvinière's death, then..."</p>
<p>"Is the best thing that could have happened for the world in
general and ourselves in particular. And he brought it on himself,
overreaching himself in his trickiness. Fetch Fougereot from the
fields, Filomène. Meanwhile I'll get the note."</p>
<p>The girl departed on her errand, and the vicomte returned to the
library. Alone with her thoughts. Mademoiselle de Montsorbier fell
momentarily to shuddering again, and again covered her face with
her hands to shut out the sight of Chauvinière as she had last seen
him. Thus Monsieur de Corbal found her on his return. She heard him
close the door of the library and turn the key in the lock. Then,
seeing her huddled there, he hastened to her side.</p>
<p>"My dear, my dear! Courage! Courage!"</p>
<p>"I need it, yes." Her pale lips were twisted into a smile
half-grim, half-whimsical. "I am not used to killing men."</p>
<p>"If I could have spared you that!" he cried. "But you have no
grounds for self-reproach." And he reasoned with her long to banish
from her mind the horror by which he perceived her to be beset. At
last his fond efforts prevailed.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. You are right. This is sheer weakness. And it's out
of season. You have the note." He held it up in silence. "Read it
to me. Let us know exactly what he has written."</p>
<p>The daylight was beginning to fade. He strode across to the
mullioned window, and with his shoulder turned towards her raised
the sheet so as to hold it to the light. In that attitude he
remained for a long while immovable and silent, until at last her
patience ended.</p>
<p>"Well?" she urged him. "Read it to me."</p>
<p>He turned to her, still in silence, and she saw that his face
was of the colour of chalk.</p>
<p>"What is it?" she cried in immediate alarm.</p>
<p>He uttered a little laugh of bitterness, of hopelessness.</p>
<p>"I seem to remember that the rascal said the trick was his. A
trick, indeed. Come here." She crossed to his side at once. "See
for yourself what he has written, the bitter jester."</p>
<p>She took the sheet from his hand, and read:</p>
<p>"My dear ci-devant&mdash;This is to assure you that within the
next twenty-four hours two things of interest to you will happen:
you will be guillotined and the dainty, slippery Montsorbier will
at last belong to me. I shall have cause to thank you for the
entertainment provided for me here to-day."</p>
<p>She looked up at Monsieur de Corbal in blank dismay. The vicomte
nodded, smiling bitterly. "He counted confidently upon tricking me
with it as he did, the resourceful dog; so confidently that he
didn't hesitate to indulge his wicked humour even with my pistol at
his head."</p>
<p>"Yes," she said. "He was like that. And his humour was the death
of him."</p>
<p>They looked at each other helplessly, almost despairingly,
bereft of the staff upon which they had so confidently looked to
lean.</p>
<p>They were back, it seemed, in the situation which had been
theirs that afternoon before the advent of Chauvinière, save that
now they were additionally burdened with the representative's dead
body. There could no longer be any question of those Revolutionary
nuptials upon which they had been counting. For in the absence of
any acceptable explanation for it, Chauvinière's disappearance must
very soon give rise to inquiry. At any moment almost that inquiry
might begin. Even if he had not announced to any his intention of
visiting Corbal, some there must have been who had seen him come
that way. He was not a man whose movements went unnoticed. He could
not pass anywhere unperceived. The trail, even if weak in places,
would presently lead to the Château de Corbal. The vicomte would be
asked questions which he could not answer. To hide the body could
not avail him. He would be required to produce the living
Chauvinière. And failing that, the conclusion was foregone. It
needed no words between them to expound all this. Each saw it
clearly.</p>
<p>"There is one thing only now," said the vicomte. "I must go. I
must set out at once before the hunt is up."</p>
<p>She looked at him, her bright face resolute.</p>
<p>"We must go, you mean."</p>
<p>He shook his head. "Do you think I'll link you to a hunted
man?"</p>
<p>"You will be hunted for the thing I did."</p>
<p>"What, then? The thing you did was done to save me. It was made
necessary by my own carelessness. The responsibility for the deed
is mine. The intention to kill him in any case was mine. Only an
accident, my own stupidity, prevented it."</p>
<p>"All that is not worth discussion," said she. "There are more
important things to consider." And that she was considering them
her knit brows bore witness.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," he agreed. "You must shift for yourself now, my
dear. It would not be wise in you to remain. I'll try to think of
something for you. All that I can think at the moment&mdash;though
it breaks my heart to say it&mdash;is that in no case must you come
with me."</p>
<p>Again she looked at him, and now she was faintly, sadly
smiling.</p>
<p>"How far do you think that you will get in your flight through
this mad land?"</p>
<p>"That's why; that's why," he answered passionately. "I know I
stand hardly a chance at all."</p>
<p>"Without me you stand none. That is why you need me more than
ever. We are to be married. That was agreed between us. Shall I let
a husband slip through my fingers without an effort."</p>
<p>"Can you jest, Cléonie." His voice was shaken with pain.</p>
<p>"Ah, but I can be serious, too," she said, now oddly tender. She
set her hands upon his shoulders and looked up into his pale,
distressed countenance. "Do you believe in Destiny, my dear?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what I believe."</p>
<p>"Consider, then. Do you think it is just blind chance that you
and I, who without knowing it have been seeking each other from the
beginning of our lives, should have been brought together in this
odd manner, at this odd time, in circumstances which left us no
leisure for ordinary wooing? My dear, don't you see that it is
Destiny which has linked us now? If I had not come when I came, you
would certainly have perished. If I had not found you when I did,
it is probable that I should have perished too. Perceiving this,
can you suppose that our lives are to end here, now that we have
met?"</p>
<p>Her earnestness shook him, and partly he succumbed as men
will&mdash;especially men in desperate case&mdash;to the suggestion
that behind all human fortunes there is a guiding Intelligence
which may not be thwarted. Nevertheless, for her sake, because of
the risk he perceived for her, he still resisted, though more
weakly now, her intention to join him in his flight.</p>
<p>"But if we separate," she said with sad conviction, "we separate
forever; there is no chance for either of us. I feel it. I know it.
Together we may win out. If we do not, at least we shall be
together to the end, as Destiny intends for us. And it is my strong
belief that we are intended for a happier union than the crazy
republican nuptials with which you would have been content."</p>
<p>He looked at her in heavy silence, looked down into those clear,
steady, fearless eyes, and surrendered at last to her dauntless
spirit. He drew her close and kissed her gently.</p>
<p>"So be it, my dear. I leave myself to you; to you and
Destiny."</p>
<p>She flashed him a quick smile, and at once became brisk and
practical. She demanded to be made free of his wardrobe that she
might find herself male garments better suited to the part she
meant to play. Naturally he desired to know what part this was,
what plan was in her mind.</p>
<p>Lightly she mocked him. "You thought, of course, that I should
be a party to a blind, blundering flight that would land us
headlong in destruction. But I am proposing an orderly retreat. I
have it here." She tapped her golden head. "The details are yet to
be thought out. That while I change my clothes. Ask me no
questions, now, my friend. Trust me and leave yourself to me, as
you said just now you would do."</p>
<p>It was generous of him to thrust aside a momentary vexation at
this half-confidence. "Have your way, then, Madame Destiny," he
said, "I have made unconditional surrender."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>Having placed at her disposal the slender resources of his
wardrobe, Monsieur de Corbal left her, and went to make his own
preparations for immediate departure. He gathered up what store of
money he possessed, a little secret hoard of gold which he disposed
in a hollow belt next to his skin, and a bundle of assignats, to be
spent on their way to the frontier, since they would be useless
beyond should they ever cross it. There were, too, a few family
jewels which&mdash;since sentiment must yield to
necessity&mdash;might later, abroad, be converted into money, and
lastly some title-deeds and other papers establishing possessions,
very insecure at present, but to become valuable again should
France ever awaken from her republican nightmare. Since to take all
was out of the question, it became necessary to select the most
important, and this selection occupied some little time.</p>
<p>Almost an hour had elapsed before he descended to the hall,
booted and spurred, carrying cloak and valise, for she had told him
that they would ride openly as soon as darkness should have fallen.
It had fallen now, and it was in the light of a cluster of candles
that he found her already awaiting him, arrayed in garments which,
despite their ridiculous looseness, gave her something of the
petit-maitre air which she had worn as Chauvinière's secretary.
Considering the amazing things that she had done with scissors and
needle, her speed in making ready seemed nothing short of
miraculous. And there were signs that her preparations had been
completed some time ago and that she had since been engaged with
arrangements which really should have been his care. For even as
Monsieur de Corbal was descending the stairs, he heard her
addressing Fougereot, who at that moment came in from the open.</p>
<p>Her voice rang sharply. "You are just in time, Fougereot. Here
is monsieur le vicomte. Have you made everything ready?"</p>
<p>"Everything as mademoiselle commanded," the man replied, and so
informed Monsieur de Corbal not only that she had disclosed her
identity to his people, but also that she had been issuing orders
concerned with their departure.</p>
<p>"And your family?"</p>
<p>"Waiting out of doors with Filomène."</p>
<p>"The horses?"</p>
<p>"Saddled and waiting, mademoiselle."</p>
<p>"The scarf and hat?"</p>
<p>"They are there, on that chair, mademoiselle."</p>
<p>Monsieur de Corbal halted beside her at this point in that
catechism. She was, he observed, rather pale and a little
breathless, but so brisk and determined in manner that wonder grew
even as he watched and listened. He was perceiving in her a further
display of that spirit which Chauvinière had so much admired.</p>
<p>In riding-boots ridiculously large, but secretly stuffed with
hay to make them fit her, she stepped aside to take up the
tricolour sash and the plumed and cockaded hat, purloined from
Chauvinière, who would no longer need them. She returned to proffer
them to the vicomte.</p>
<p>"These are for you."</p>
<p>He recoiled, almost in horror.</p>
<p>"You must wear them, my friend," she insisted. "It is a
necessity. Henceforth, you are the citizen-representative
Chauvinière."</p>
<p>"It will need more than this..." he was beginning.</p>
<p>"I have more." She tapped her breast. "Trust me a little, my
friend. Above all do not let us now delay. Come."</p>
<p>He yielded to her peremptoriness and suffered her to assist him
to assume the sash of office, and afterwards to lead him out,
Fougereot following with Monsieur de Corbal's valise.</p>
<p>Outside by the horses, visible in the light that streamed
through the open door, Stood Fougereot's wife and their two big
lads and Filomène. Came brief but touching farewells between the
seigneur and his shrunken family. The Fougereots, all four, were in
tears, not only at parting with their vicomte, but at what else
remained to be done. This and the stifled sobbing of Filomène moved
him so profoundly that he could not trust himself to speak. In
silence he wrung the hand of each in turn, then got to horse. It
was Mademoiselle de Montsorbier who spoke for him now.</p>
<p>"You will care for the land," she told them, "and count it your
own until monsieur the vicomte comes to claim it again."</p>
<p>"God send that may be soon!" said Fougereot, and in a choking
voice added something which the vicomte did not understand. "We'll
rebuild the house for you."</p>
<p>"God keep you, monsieur le vicomte!" cried Fougereot's wife, and
the others repeated it after her.</p>
<p>With that valediction ringing in his ears, Corbal, still
half-bemused, put spurs to his horse, and presently, by a path that
skirted the little town of Poussignot, he was trotting through the
dusk with his fair, frail, but very resolute companion, their faces
set towards Burgundy.</p>
<p>They breasted a slope to the east of the town, and an hour and a
half later paused on the summit to breathe their horses and to look
back.</p>

<p class="caption">They paused on the summit to look back</p>
<p>The valley below lay all in darkness. But five miles to westward
a flaming beacon split the gloom and drew the eye. It drew more
than the eye of Monsieur de Corbal. A moment he gazed, his head
craned forward, his breath suspended.</p>
<p>"God of Heaven!" he cried out at last. "That is Corbal. It is on
fire." Had he himself been burning at the stake, his voice could
hardly have carried more distress.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle, at his elbow, sighed before replying.</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear. It is Corbal. Corbal and all that it contains as
a funeral pyre to Chauvinière."</p>
<p>Something in her quiet tone recalled Fougereot's cryptic phrase:
"We will rebuild the house." He swung in the saddle to peer at her
through the gloom.</p>
<p>"You knew!" he cried, almost in reproach.</p>
<p>"I ordered it."</p>
<p>"You ordered it?" Amazement raised his voice. "And they obeyed
you."</p>
<p>"Only because they perceived the need to do so, for your own
safety and for theirs."</p>
<p>"The need? What need? And why was I not told?" He was between
anger and complaint.</p>
<p>"You might have demurred, and time might have been lost in
persuading you. Perhaps, out of a natural love for the house of
your fathers, you might have refused to be persuaded until it was
too late. Fougereot perceived that, too. Therefore, he obeyed
me."</p>
<p>"But the need for this?" he repeated.</p>
<p>"The need to destroy all evidence of what took place, not only
to ensure against pursuit, but also to make things safe for your
people who remain, and who might otherwise be incriminated. Listen,
my dear. By now the Fougereots will be in Poussignot with the tale
in which I instructed them. They will relate that returning from
the fields at dusk they found the château on fire. That is all they
know. Poussignot will surmise a dozen things, amongst them that you
have perished in the flames, which they may even suppose&mdash;the
Fougereots may hint it&mdash;that you set alight. They will surmise
things, too, on the score of Chauvinière, particularly if it be
known to any of them that he went to Corbal this evening. But don't
let that trouble you. By dawn we shall be far away."</p>
<p>"You make it clear," he said. "Forgive my dullness." He looked
across the valley at the leaping flames, and as he looked his sight
grew blurred. "Yes, it was necessary all things considered. But,
oh, my God!"</p>
<p>It was a moment before she answered him, and when she did so,
she set a hand upon his arm.</p>
<p>"In this world, Raoul, all things worth having must be bought
and paid for. That bonfire is the price you pay for life. Is it
worth while?"</p>
<p>Instantly he swung to her, and cast his weakness from him.</p>
<p>"A thousand times if I am not to be cheated yet. If I am to buy
life and love."</p>
<p>"You shall not be cheated, my dear. I have promised you both,
and I'll not cheat you of either." She withdrew her hand from his
arm, and spoke in another, brisker tone. "Let us push on.
Henceforth you are the representative Chauvinière on a mission to
Switzerland, and I am your secretary Antoine."</p>
<p>He sighed, still dubious. "Yes. But if we are called upon to
prove it?"</p>
<p>She proffered him a package, wrapped in oiled silk and tied by a
ribbon. "You had better carry these," she said. "They are the
passports of the Committee of Safety to the representative
Chauvinière and his secretary, commanding all to aid and warning
all against hindering them, in the name of the Republic, One and
Indivisible. And there are some other papers, also of importance,
enjoining obedience upon all civil functionaries. It was prudent of
me to have taken the representative's portfolio when I fled from
him at La Charite. But I never thought to pass myself off again as
his secretary, as I never thought to find a substitute for
Chauvinière himself, nor while he lived would this have been
easy."</p>
<p>He was silent a long time in sheer wonder of her wit and
resource. Then he fetched a sigh that ended in a little laugh.</p>
<p>"I should have known better than to suppose that you merely
hoped to strike blindly across the frontier. This makes things
easy...assured! Oh, it is incredible, as incredible as you are,
Cléonie!"</p>
<p>He heard her answering laugh in the dark. "Let us be moving,
dear. We are on surer ground, I think, than your republican
nuptials would have provided."</p>
<p>He wheeled his horse to follow her.</p>
<p>"The nuptials surely are also in the arrangement," said he.</p>
<p>Again her laughter answered him, but this time very soft and
tender. And the nuptials followed, in Lausanne, a week later, when
they found themselves among friends.</p>
