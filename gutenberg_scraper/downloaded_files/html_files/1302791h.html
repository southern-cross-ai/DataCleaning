  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">HARRY THE LANCER came into Burton Street Station to show his
  "brief," for he was out of Dartmoor only that Monday, having served
  twenty-one months short of seven years.</p>

  <p>He slouched in, a scowl on his yellow, scarred face, and produced his
  document to the station sergeant.</p>

  <p>"Henry Beneford, S'ar'nt&mdash;convic' on license. Gotta report
  here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And then he saw Inspector Long (or, as they called him, "Betcher,") and
  his eyes blazed. It was unfortunate in many ways, but most unfortunate for
  the Lancer, as it proved, that Betcher was present. He had called round to
  identify a much-desired shoplifter.</p>

  <p>"Morning, Inspector. Still alive, I see?"</p>

  <p>"And kicking," said Sub-Inspector Arnold Long cheerfully.</p>

  <p>The ugly lip of Harry the Lancer curled.</p>

  <p>"Wonder your perishin' conscience don't keep you awake at night&mdash;you
  got me seven by lyin' an' artfulness!"</p>

  <p>"And I hope to get you another seven," said Betcher cheerfully. "If I had
  my way, Lancer, I'd put you in a lethal chamber&mdash;where they put the
  other mad dogs. And the world would be a better place."</p>

  <p>The long upper lip of the man began to twitch spasmodically. People who
  knew him best flew to cover at this ominous warning, but though Arnold Long
  knew him well enough, he was not alarmed.</p>

  <p>Truly, the Lancer had been a lancer in His Majesty's Army for eighteen
  months, at the end of which time he went down for three years for kicking a
  corporal to unconsciousness. He was a bully, a thief, and a dangerous man.
  But then, Betcher was also a dangerous man.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, mister. I'm not going to threaten you. I'm not givin' you a
  chance to send me back to the Awful Place, but what I'm a-goin' to say to you
  is this: <i>you watch out!</i>"</p>

  <p>Betcher smiled.</p>

  <p>"You talk too much, Lancer," he said pleasantly. "One of these days you'll
  be going into Parliament."</p>

  <p>The convict was trembling with fury; the twitching upper lip quivered
  again. He tried to speak but could not, and, turning to the sergeant at the
  desk, laid down his papers with a hand that shook.</p>

  <p>"Clever&mdash;you're all clever. People like me are easy to
  catch&mdash;why'n' you get Shelton, hey? All the busies in England can't get
  him. Not even amachers!"</p>

  <p>Betcher did not reply to this, being wholly uninterested in Clay Shelton
  at the moment. He did, however, recognize that the slighting reference to
  "amachers" was immediately directed to himself, but that reproach had never
  worried him, for he was a good professional, as Lancer had reason to
  know.</p>

  <p>Returning to Scotland Yard, he discovered that Mr. Shelton was indeed a
  vital interest in life.</p>

  <p>There was, in truth, no such man in the world as "Clay Shelton." Yet for
  fifteen years he had been engaged in the forging and uttering of letters of
  credit, bills of exchange, and other negotiable security. And fifteen years
  is a long time. "Clay Shelton" was merely a label that indicated his
  activities&mdash; it was the name written in the register of the White Hart
  Hotel at Dorking on September 3, 1899, by a thin, near-sighted man who took
  seven thousand pounds out of the Sussex Bank by one of the simplest of tricks
  and the most elementary of forgeries. It was the first name by which he was
  known, and it served to mark him on record cards at police headquarters.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Hillerby, of the Army Pay Corps, who drew twenty-five
  thousand seven hundred pounds from the Bank of Africa by means of a forged
  warrant, was undoubtedly the same gentleman, with a moustache and monocle.
  The bank detective who, being well acquainted with military matters,
  suspected this new colonel and followed him to Wynberg was found knifed in a
  pine wood near Kenilworth, for "Clay" supported his ingenuity with
  violence.</p>

  <p>Fleet-Paymaster Corban-Smith, who took almost the same amount from the
  Portsmouth and Southern Bank, had no moustache and wore a naval officer's
  uniform, the left breast of which was gay with medal ribbons.</p>

  <p>The bank messenger who walked into the Bank of England and withdrew sixty-
  five thousand pounds on behalf of the Midland &amp; Western had a gray
  moustache and Scottish accent. Frederick G. Tennycold, of Chicago, who
  presented a letter of credit to another branch of the same bank and carried
  off six thousand, wore horn-rimmed spectacles and the badge of the Knights of
  Columbus&mdash;there were scores of other names that the police entered on
  his dossier, but officially he was "Clay Shelton."</p>

  <p>Inspector Vansittar, a depressed and gloomy man, had an interview with his
  chief.</p>

  <p>"I'm extremely sorry, Vansittar, but you've only had the experience which
  other officers have had," said the chief, shaking his white head, "and the
  best I can do for you is to take you off the case and give it to somebody
  else. Fortunately for you, as I say, every other man who has touched the
  Shelton forgeries has fallen down."</p>

  <p>Mr. Shelton had, three months before, obtained eighteen thousand three
  hundred and twenty pounds from the Foreign Department of the City of London
  Bank by means of a forged cable transfer. All the experts agreed that it was
  the neatest "job" that had ever been done, but whilst police headquarters
  could offer a detached admiration for a clever piece of work, it was vitally
  necessary that it should not be repeated.</p>

  <p>"We can't catch him because we don't know him," said the inspector, "but
  mostly because he works alone. Even the cable job was single-handed. The
  cable advice was forged and delivered in London, and so was the confirmation.
  A man clever enough to work on his own can only be caught by the act of the
  Lord! If there was a woman attached to him, if he had a wife or a side
  partner of any kind, he wouldn't have run fifteen years."</p>

  <p>There was an awkward, even a painful, silence here. The chief, liking the
  officer and desiring to let him down lightly, could think of no way but a
  harsh one for ending this talk; the inspector had no further excuses.</p>

  <p>But there was a suggestion to make, and this he offered.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe anybody will catch him unless he makes a bad slip, but
  there is a man who might&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He waited for encouragement. Colonel Macfarlane knew just whom he meant,
  and did not speak, wishing that the responsibility for the suggestion should
  at least be halved.</p>

  <p>"Betcher?" suggested Vansittar, and the Colonel's nose wrinkled.</p>

  <p>"Umph! Betcher!" He shook his head disparagingly.</p>

  <p>Betcher Long, his vulgar nickname notwithstanding, was a university man,
  and he was the son of a millionaire in spite of the fact that he was a
  policeman. Why the son of Sir Godley Long became a policeman at all is too
  long a story to tell. On a certain gloomy day, he was sent down from
  Cambridge by an enraged vice-chancellor, his crime being that he had fought
  and beaten a lowly official of the university, to wit Tom Helpford, the
  bulldog guardian of a proctor.</p>

  <p>Therefore was he sent with ignominy to his parent. And his parent, being
  rather testy over the matter, advised Arnold Murry Long to go forth into the
  world and earn his own living. And Betcher obeyed. He turned up at his
  father's house in Berkeley Square one month later wearing the uniform of a
  constable of the Metropolitan Police, and not all the pleadings and stormings
  of Sir Godley could induce him to change it.</p>

  <p>That is most of the story: they called him "Betcher" because that was a
  favoured challenge of his.</p>

  <p>His father did not wash his hands of his only son. He took a certain pride
  in his eccentricity; was wont to talk at his very exclusive club of "my son,
  the copper." He had once waylaid Arnold at the corner of Hill Street one
  foggy night and offered him beer. How Arnold had emptied the can joyously and
  then threatened to arrest his father for loitering became a legend of
  clubland.</p>

  <p>Because of his wealthy associations, authority would have kept Arnold
  walking a beat, being fearful of a charge of favouritism and the questions
  which would be inevitably raised in Parliament if he received promotion out
  of his turn. Yet in two years he was a sergeant, and not an ill-natured
  question could be asked, for he had taken Lew Fredding, wanted for lifting a
  quarter of a million dollars from the New York Security Bank, and had
  followed up this exploit by tackling with his bare hands those notorious
  gunmen, Sullivan and Veilt, after the killing of Parlyvoo Smith, the
  informer. Nothing could hold back his stripes after that. Scotland Yard
  transferred him to the Criminal Investigation Department, where he would be
  overshadowed by greater men. Driving home one night in the fog, he overtook a
  man with a limp who, because of the propitious weather, had ventured from his
  hiding place for a little exercise. Betcher stopped his car, jumped out, and,
  miraculously avoiding two bullets, arrested with some difficulty Ernie
  Budlow, bank robber and blackmailer, "wanted" on six distinct charges.</p>

  <p>"Luck!" said the Yard, but they had to give him an acting inspectorship
  because the Home Secretary made the recommendation over his own sprawling
  signature.</p>

  <p>He was not the ideal of Scotland Yard. They did not hold him up as a model
  for young detectives to follow. He had, he admitted, been so often on the
  carpet that he had worn a hole in it. Suspension from duty had come his way;
  a severe reprimand, afterward expunged from his "sheet," had blotted his
  record; and once he had earned the censure of a judge for his
  unconstitutional methods.</p>

  <p>In height he was sixty-nine inches, and gave the impression that he was
  rather thin. He could run like a hare but more intelligently; as a boxer, he
  held the amateur championship for two years; he could climb like a cat, and
  had something of the cat's sensitiveness. He called himself English to annoy
  Macfarlane, the chief, who never allowed the word "English" to pass where
  "British" would serve.</p>

  <p>His face was thin and long and had an everlasting smile, for life and the
  world were a great joke. When the Boylans caught him off Limehouse Reach and
  gave him five minutes to prepare himself for a rapid translation to another
  world, his white teeth showed in glee.</p>

  <p>"You don't kill me for a thousand&mdash;betcher!"</p>

  <p>And they didn't. He swam two miles with hands and feet tied, and when he
  was rescued by the Thames police, the first words that came from his
  chattering teeth (the time was mid-January and the river was full of ice)
  were: "I'll get Joe Boylan in twenty-four hours&mdash;betcher a thousand!"
  And Joe he caught.</p>

  <p>Colonel Macfarlane might well wrinkle his nose at the thought of putting
  Betcher Long on the Shelton case. In England the third degree is
  unknown&mdash; Betcher had invented a fourth. Did he not hold the head of Lew
  Brayley until he confessed where he had hidden the small son of Mr. John
  Brisbane, the millionaire shipowner, kidnapped and held for ransom? Was it
  not Betcher who earned the censure of a High Court judge for breaking open
  the safe of Lester Glommen and securing there from the proof, and the only
  proof obtainable, of his connection with the Texan oil swindle which was so
  profitable to Lester that he might have retired a very rich man in a few
  months?</p>

  <p>"Betcher?" The chief pulled at his lower lip thoughtfully. "I daren't do
  it! Betcher would do something outrageous, and the kick would come back to
  this office... Still..."</p>

  <p>He mused on the matter all day, and at five o'clock in the evening Mr.
  Arnold Long was summoned to his superior's bureau.</p>

  <p>Betcher listened with his set grin.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I don't want to see the papers&mdash;I know Shelton's record by
  heart. Give me three months and I'll put him where he'll keep regular
  hours."</p>

  <p>"Don't be too sure, Mr. Long!" warned the Colonel.</p>

  <p>"Betch&mdash;I mean I'm pretty sure," said Arnold respectfully.</p>

  <p>So, with many admonitions, warnings, and sundry words of good advice,
  Betcher Long went forth and reported to the Chairman of the Bankers'
  Association.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">ONE fine spring morning, Mr. Shelton strolled down Lombard
  Street, a thoroughfare entirely devoted to banking establishments; and as he
  walked, gently swinging his tightly rolled umbrella, he allowed his fancy to
  roam back through the ages, when this little street had been packed tight
  with the houses of Germanic money-lenders, and the Lombard rooms, or lumber
  rooms as the word had been corrupted, were crowded with the pledged furniture
  of their clients.</p>

  <p>He paused before a building that was dour and mean-looking in spite of its
  polished granite face, and stared up, as a tourist might stare, at its
  monotonous rows of windows.</p>

  <p>"What is this place?"</p>

  <p>A City policeman stood in the roadway near the edge of the sidewalk, and
  the City policeman is a guide-book as well as an incomparable director of
  traffic.</p>

  <p>"City &amp; Southern Bank, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" said Mr. Shelton mildly, and gazed at the building with, as it
  seemed to the policeman, a new respect.</p>

  <p>A car drove up; the chauffeur jumped out and opened the door, and there
  alighted first a very pretty girl, and then an elderly, sallow-faced woman,
  and lastly a good-looking young man with a black moustache and a monocle, and
  carrying his glossy silk hat in his hand, for the height of the car roof had
  made its wearing a precarious business.</p>

  <p>They passed into the bank and the policeman strolled up to the
  chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"How long will they be before they come out?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Five minutes," said the chauffeur, stretching himself comfortably.</p>

  <p>"If they're any longer, pull out and park." The policeman gave the driver
  some instructions and strolled back to the sightseer.</p>

  <p>"You a stranger to London, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Shelton nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've just come back from South America. I've been there twenty-five
  years. The Argentine Bank is somewhere along here, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>The policeman pointed, but Mr. Shelton made no attempt to continue his
  walk.</p>

  <p>"It is very difficult to believe that in this street are stored millions
  and millions of gold."</p>

  <p>The policeman smiled sardonically.</p>

  <p>"I've never seen any of it," he said, "but there's no doubt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped and his hand went halfway up to a salute. A taxicab had drawn
  in behind the car, a young man had jumped out. He flashed a reproachful grin
  at the policeman, took in Mr. Shelton with one comprehensive glance. and
  disappeared into the bank.</p>

  <p>"Who was that&mdash;a police officer?" For Shelton had detected the
  interrupted salute.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, he's a City gentleman I know," replied the officer, and strolled
  off to give instructions to the taxi-driver.</p>

  <p>Betcher Long passed into the bank, was attracted for a second by a pretty
  face at one of the tellers' desks, and disappeared into the holy of the
  general manager's office. A stout little man, completely bald, rose and shook
  hands vigorously.</p>

  <p>"I'll only keep you a minute, Long," he said. "I've got a customer to
  see."</p>

  <p>He darted out of the room and was gone a few minutes and returned rubbing
  his hands, a smile on his rubicund face.</p>

  <p>"There's a woman of character," he said, shaking his head ecstatically.
  "Did you notice her?"</p>

  <p>"I thought she was rather pretty," replied Betcher, and Mr. Monkford was
  good-naturedly impatient.</p>

  <p>"That was the secretary. The elderly woman I'm talking about&mdash;Miss
  Revelstoke. She's been one of my customers for nearly thirty years. You ought
  to meet her; she's a character. The young man with her is her lawyer. He's a
  bit of a dude, but he's one of the rising men in the law."</p>

  <p>There was in the manager's office a foot square of unclouded glass, which
  commanded a view of the long counter at which the three people were standing.
  The elderly lady was counting with great deliberation a bundle of notes that
  had been passed across to her by the teller, and the girl, a little bored, he
  thought, was gazing up at the beautifully carved ceiling of the bank. It was
  an unusual face: that was his first impression. Certain types of prettiness
  are commonplace, but there was a distinction in her face, a vitality that was
  arresting. He hardly noticed the smiling young man at Miss Revelstoke's
  elbow. And then, suddenly, her eyes met his, and for a second they looked at
  each other with an absorbed interest. As quickly, she turned, and he became
  conscious that the banker was speaking.</p>

  <p>"...I don't suppose you'll ever catch him; I don't suppose anybody will
  catch him. He's like an eel, that fellow! My theory is that he's a member of
  a very clever gang</p>

  <p>"I wish to Heaven he was," smiled Betcher. "You can drop that idea, Mr.
  Monkford. There is no honour amongst thieves&mdash;only amongst good thieves.
  The man is working single-handed, and that is his biggest asset."</p>

  <p>The banker had taken from a drawer of his desk a large portfolio, which he
  laid on the table.</p>

  <p>"Here are all the facts, not only relating to the City &amp; Southern, but
  to every bank that has been victimized by this man," he said. "All his
  original signatures are here, but I don't think they will teach you much. The
  'm's' are similar&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All 'm's' are similar," interrupted Arnold Long. "It is the one letter of
  the alphabet that has no character."</p>

  <p>He spent half an hour examining the dossier and found no profit in his
  inspection.</p>

  <p>"I notice that these documents have been tested for finger prints?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Monkford nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is one of the features of every forgery. The left hand, which kept
  the document steady, was invariably gloved."</p>

  <p>When Betcher came out of the bank, he looked left and right, undetermined
  as to which way he should go, and at last decided to go toward Gracechurch
  Street and make a call at a shipping office in Fenchurch Street. At the
  corner of Gracechurch and Lombard streets he saw a slim, elderly man
  standing, apparently absorbed in the streaming traffic. He was looking
  sideways at the stranger as he passed, and Betcher read the message of that
  scrutiny. It was only for a fraction of a second, but as plainly as words
  could speak, those gray, watchful eyes said: "I know you: you are a
  detective!"</p>

  <p>Betcher experienced a little shock, but could neither analyze its genesis
  nor find a reason. He crossed the road to Fenchurch Street and turned to buy
  a newspaper. The man was still there, a well-dressed, debonair colonel of
  infantry he might have been, with his white felt hat and his well-fitting
  tweed suit. Betcher purposely gave the boy a shilling in order to have an
  excuse for waiting for the change, and in that time he took stock of the
  stranger. A City swindler of some kind; one of the little army of men who
  thrive on questionable enterprises. He had caught in that one glimpse of the
  man's mind a hint of resentment as well as knowledge. For a second he had a
  mind to return and find an excuse for speaking to the man. But he was a
  Scotland Yard man in the City of London. The City has its own detective force
  and is jealous of encroachment.</p>

  <p>As he stood, the figure in gray hailed a passing taxicab, which turned up
  Lombard Street and disappeared. It was hardly out of sight when, acting on an
  impulse, Betcher Long called a cab.</p>

  <p>"Lombard Street," he said quickly, "and keep well behind the yellow taxi.
  You'll catch him up in the block before the Mansion House."</p>

  <p>Presently the taxi came in sight, and, holding the outspread newspaper
  which hid his face, he saw his prey look back through the peephole.</p>

  <p>That night, when Colonel Macfarlane was leaving his office, a jubilant
  young man intercepted him.</p>

  <p>"Call me lucky!" he chortled. "I've found Clay Shelton."</p>

  <p>"You never have!" gasped the Commissioner. "Betcher!" said Mr. Long
  promptly.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">A WEEK later, as Mr. Clay Shelton was passing through the
  dingy little town of Chelmsford, he had an inspiration&mdash;a sudden
  unaccountable fear that depressed him so much that for a second he could not
  breathe naturally. He threw his gear into neutral, pressed his foot slowly on
  the brake and came to a halt by the side of the road. On his right was a high
  wall of dingy red, and, standing back from the roadway, a grim, black
  gate.</p>

  <p>Mr. Shelton stroked the white moustache he had so carefully cultivated for
  the past six months.</p>

  <p>Chelmsford Jail. He must have seen the place without realizing that he had
  seen it, and the depression lay at the end of a chain of subconscious
  reasoning.</p>

  <p>A little wicket door set in the black gate opened and a warder came out,
  and then four men and another warder. The four men wore ordinary civilian
  clothing, but they were chained together. Convicts on their way to Dartmoor,
  Mr. Shelton mused. They would be in London in time to catch the one o'clock
  train for Plymouth. The wicket gate remained open. The jailer at the door and
  the warder in charge discussed something. What it was Mr. Shelton guessed
  when a taxicab came furiously from the town end of the Colchester Road and
  pulled up at the prison gate. The prisoners were bundled in, one of the
  warders with them; the other took his seat by the driver's side and the cab
  went away.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said Shelton thoughtfully, and stroked his moustache again.</p>

  <p>Stepping on the starter, he turned his machine and went back to Chelmsford
  and, stopping his car at the Saracen's Head, got out. There was a
  booksellers' and stationers' shop which had a notice in its window:</p><br>

  <p class="sign">ADVERTISEMENTS RECEIVED HERE<br>
  FOR ALL THE LONDON NEWSPAPERS</p><br>

  <p>He went into the shop, asked for a blank, and filled it up. There was some
  delay here, for the only person in the shop at this early hour was a youthful
  assistant who had begun his employment that day and was strange to the
  routine. Eventually the necessary forms were discovered.</p>

  <p>"That is to go in the personal column of the Times," he said, and paid the
  fee.</p>

  <p>The youth took the blank and read it carefully, though there was little
  need for care, for every word was printed. Mr. Shelton went on his way with a
  lighter heart, and the young man who had accepted the advertisement put it
  for safety between the pages of a book he had been reading, and which he was
  still reading, to the neglect of his duties, when his new employer came upon
  the scene and in a fit of choler discharged him.</p>

  <p>When he jerked back to its shelf Mr. Anthony Trollope's fascinating study
  of clerical life, he filed away unconsciously the advertisement. Mr.
  Shelton's lightness of heart was, in the circumstances, premature.</p>

  <p>Outside of Colchester, Shelton drove his machine into a side lane, took
  from a locker beneath the seat a compact suitcase in which were the change of
  clothing, the scissors, cream, and razor that would in the shortest possible
  time change him into a rather seedy-looking person, and, having examined
  every article with care, he walked jauntily to the place where the tramcars
  start, boarded one, and was jerked uncomfortably to the centre of the
  town&mdash;Colchester being notably unhappy in its street transportation.</p>

  <p>Ten o'clock was striking as he entered the premises of the Eastern
  Counties Bank.</p>

  <p>He laid down a paper and a book, and the spectacled clerk examined both
  carefully before he disappeared into the office of his manager. When he came
  back it was with the respectful and apologetic smile of one who found that
  his worst fears were without foundation.</p>

  <p>"Seven thousand six hundred," he said cheerfully. "How will you have this,
  Colonel Weatherby?"</p>

  <p>"In hundreds," said Mr. Shelton.</p>

  <p>Pads of notes came into view, the cashier's finger moved with
  extraordinary rapidity; he scribbled the numbers in his book.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Shelton turned, putting the notes into his breast pocket. There were
  two men in the room, and one passing through the swing doors. The first of
  these was a weary-looking gentleman who supported himself at the counter. At
  him Shelton did not look; but the man with his back to the door, showing his
  white teeth in a smile. "'Morning, Shelton."</p>

  <p>Betcher Long&mdash;of all people in the world! Shelton stopped, his face
  outthrust, at bay.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to talk to me? My name is not Shelton."</p>

  <p>Arnold Long nodded; he took off his hat and ran his fingers through his
  black hair.</p>

  <p>"Thought I would," he said.</p>

  <p>And then Shelton leapt at him.</p>

  <p>In a second three men were struggling on the floor. Up to his feet came
  Shelton; the second policeman fumbled and bungled all the time in Betcher's
  way. And then the weary man at the counter took a hand, and thrust into the
  tangle of whirling arms and straining bodies.</p>

  <p>"Here, I say! Confound it!"</p>

  <p>There was a deafening explosion, the second policeman went down on the
  tessellated floor, bleeding hideously. "Put that pistol down or I'll
  shoot!"</p>

  <p>Shelton turned his head. The bespectacled clerk covered him with a heavy
  army revolver, and his hand was wonderfully steady. There had recently been a
  war, in which bespectacled bank clerks had learnt to kill people with the
  greatest nonchalance.</p>

  <p>Betcher Long snapped cold irons on the wrist of the white-faced man. Two
  uniformed policemen came into the office whilst the clerk was 'phoning the
  hospital.</p>

  <p>"I want you for forgery," said Arnold; looked down at the limp heap and
  the widening circle of blood, and then:</p>

  <p>"Thought you never carried a gun?"</p>

  <p>Shelton said nothing, and the detective turned to the languid stranger who
  had intervened.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir. I'm obliged to you." And then, recognizing the
  helper:</p>

  <p>"You're Mr. Crayley, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>The face of this man of fashion who had intervened in the fight was the
  colour of chalk; his yellow moustache drooped pathetically.</p>

  <p>"Might have been killed, by gad!" he croaked. "Did my best for you. Let me
  know if I can do anything more. Is he dead?"</p>

  <p>"I guess so." Betcher stared gloomily at the still figure. "Wish you
  hadn't done that, Shelton. But it will be easier to prove than the other
  murders. We'll take him to the station house before the crowd get him. Show
  me the back way out of here."</p>

  <p>The manager led the party through his private office to a courtyard at the
  back of the bank. A small gate led to a narrow street, where a car and two
  policemen were waiting. Betcher had planned this exit.</p>

  <p>He pushed his prisoner into the machine and followed. Where had Shelton
  seen manacled men thrust into a cab? At Chelmsford&mdash;a thousand years
  ago!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">ON THE 14th of June, Inspector Arnold Long left London at
  five o'clock on a perfect morning, when the sun was shining and every
  cottager's garden he passed was ablaze with blue and gold. The roads were
  empty save for the farmers' lorries, and he came into Chelmsford before a
  shop was open, and only the labourers on their way to the fields to speculate
  upon his haste.</p>

  <p>He had passed through a little village and was speeding down a straight
  road that ran between green fields when he passed a man sitting on the top of
  a field gate. In that instant he recognized the idler, and, jamming on his
  brakes, went at reverse and ran back to where he had seen the man. He was
  still sitting on the top rail, a cigarette drooping limply from his lips, and
  met the astonished gaze of the detective without embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, Lancer. Have you taken to the agricultural life?"</p>

  <p>The Lancer took out his cigarette, looked at it thoughtfully, and threw it
  away.</p>

  <p>"Doin' any harm to anybody?" he demanded truculently.</p>

  <p>"Are you on the road?" Betcher asked politely, using the term which most
  euphemistically described a tramp.</p>

  <p>"I've got a job, if you want to know&mdash;a good job!" There was a queer
  expression on the Lancer's face. "Where you off to&mdash;blood'ound?"</p>

  <p>Arnold Long smiled&mdash;he hadn't dreamt that he would smile that
  morning.</p>

  <p>"Thief-catching, Lancer." He looked round the deserted fields. The only
  building in sight was a big black barn. "You haven't slept out, I'll swear!
  And you haven't walked far&mdash;there is no dust on your boots. Lancer, what
  is the game?"</p>

  <p>But the Lancer did not reply. With a gesture he waved his hand toward
  distant Chelmsford, and, chuckling to himself, Arnold Long went on his
  way.</p>

  <p>His car drew up before the black dates of Chelmsford Jail as the clock was
  striking seven. He rang the bell and was admitted to a little lobby, whence
  he was conducted by a warder along a narrow passage out of which opened a
  door.</p>

  <p>The Governor was in his tiny office, alone, for neither the under-Sheriff
  nor the other officials peculiar to such an occasion had arrived.</p>

  <p>"The chaplain is with him now. I hope it isn't going to be very painful
  for you&mdash;I hate these affairs!" Arnold nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've been praying all the way down from London that he'd change his mind
  and wouldn't see me."</p>

  <p>The Governor shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't think that's likely," he said. "The last question he put to me
  last night was whether you were coming. I told him I'd sent the request to
  the Home Office, and that I'd had a telegram to say that you would be here
  this morning."</p>

  <p>He rose from his chair, and the detective followed him along the corridor,
  down two steps, the end of which was barred by a heavy steel door. This the
  Governor opened, and they were in a large hall, lined on both sides with
  three tiers of doors. Outside the cell nearest them when they had entered a
  warder was on duty. The cell door itself was ajar, and a gleam of light
  showed from the interior.</p>

  <p>"Wait," said the Governor, and went into the cell.</p>

  <p>Presently he came out and beckoned Long, and, with a heart that beat a
  little faster, Arnold went into the chamber of death.</p>

  <p>Shelton sat on his bed, his hands in his pockets. He was in his
  shirt-sleeves and colourless. His face was covered with a gray beard, and the
  detective would not have recognized him.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Long. Give him a chair, will you?"</p>

  <p>But Inspector Long stood, waiting&mdash;for what?</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd see you before I went off."</p>

  <p>He took out the cigarette he was smoking and puffed a ring, watching it
  till it struck the stone roof and was dissipated.</p>

  <p>"I've killed four men in my time and never regretted it," he said
  meditatively. "There was a bank detective in Cape Town, and a bank manager in
  Bombay. I didn't intend killing this fellow, but the dope I gave him put him
  out. Then, of course, there was the case in Selby. He trailed me to my
  houseboat&mdash;it was rather a nasty business; you'll find him buried near
  the two big poplars at Wenham Abbey."</p>

  <p>Arnold waited.</p>

  <p>"The fourth..." Again Shelton puffed a ring to the ceiling and watched it.
  "The fourth I will not trouble you about, because it was a singularly
  unpleasant affair... and rather messy!"</p>

  <p>He smiled up at the stern-faced man before him.</p>

  <p>"And now I'm going to pay, you think&mdash;you're wrong! They will drop me
  and they will bury me, but I will live! And I will get you, Mr. Betcher Long!
  I will get every man who brought me to my death!"</p>

  <p>Then, seeing the look in the detective's face, he laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"You think I'm crazy with the heat! There are things in this world
  undreamed of in your philosophy, my friend, and the Gallows Hand is one of
  them!"</p>

  <p>His eyes sank to the paved floor and he frowned for a second, then laughed
  again.</p>

  <p>"That is all," he said curtly. "You'll remember that, Mr. Long&mdash;the
  Gallows Hand that will come up from the grave and grip you by the throat
  sooner or later!"</p>

  <p>Long made no reply, and followed the Governor into the big hall.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of that?" asked the Deputy, wiping his forehead. He was
  rather white and shaken. "The Gallows Hand... my God!"</p>

  <p>"It won't get me," said Arnold Long, nodding slowly. "And what's more,
  I'll betcher!"</p>

  <p>He did not wait for the end. Just outside Chelmsford is a tiny village
  with a very old church. He saw the hands approaching the hour, stopped his
  car, and removed his hat. Suddenly the hour boomed forth,
  one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;
  six&mdash;seven&mdash;eight.</p>

  <p>"God rest the poor gink!" said Betcher Long, for he knew that at that
  second the soul of Clay Shelton had passed to eternity.</p>

  <p>"Gallows Hand!" he mused, and smiled, and at that moment something struck
  the wind-screen and scattered into fragments.</p>

  <p>He jerked the car to a standstill.</p>

  <p>Ping!</p>

  <p>The second bullet carried away his hat; he felt the wind of the third pass
  his lips.</p>

  <p>In a second he was out of the car, gazing round the placid, smiling
  countryside. There was nobody in sight, no hedges that could hide an
  assassin, except-He saw a little hedgerow, above which was a pale vapour of
  smoke. He sprinted across the meadow which separated him, and as he ran he
  heard a fourth shot and dropped flat on the ground. No sound of the bullet
  came to him, and, rising, he continued to run, zigzagging left and right.</p>

  <p>Then he saw something that brought his heart to his mouth. Rising above
  the grasses near the hedgerow was a great white hand, its stiff fingers
  convulsively clutching at nothingness.</p>

  <p>In a second he had reached the spot. A man lay on his back, his hand
  thrown up to the smiling sky. By his side was a service rifle which the other
  hand clutched in the grip of death.</p>

  <p>And then Arnold saw the face.</p>

  <p>It was Harry the Lancer, and he was dead!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">HARRY THE LANCER! Arnold Long stared down into the gray
  face, almost unable to believe the evidence of his eyes. A brief examination
  showed the cause of the convict's death. He had been shot at close quarters
  from behind. Betcher picked up the rifle: the barrel was still hot, and there
  was a live cartridge in the chamber.</p>

  <p>A few yards away was the hedge, and beyond this he discovered a steep bank
  leading down to a sunken road. There was no sign of life here, but the narrow
  road twisted out of sight fifty yards beyond, and there were wheel tracks on
  the white dust. He climbed the bank again to where the body lay, and was
  stooping when he heard the "pop-pop" of a motor-cycle, and caught a glimpse
  of the leather-covered head of its rider.</p>

  <p>He was going along the road where the detective had left his car, and,
  raising himself, Long signalled the rider to stop. The man, whoever he was,
  must have seen him, but he did not arrest his speed, though he seemed to
  slacken a second as he came abreast of the car. In a few seconds, he was out
  of sight behind the alders that fringed the road.</p>

  <p>The detective looked round for help The shots must have been heard. And
  then he saw in the distance a black barn which seemed peculiarly familiar,
  and he remembered that it was at this spot on the road that he had seen the
  Lancer that morning.</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it but to drive into the nearest village and procure
  help. He was more than halfway across the field when he saw a bright,
  straight tongue of flame leap up from the place where he had stopped his car;
  there was a deafening explosion, and in a second the air was filled with
  scraps of flying wood and metal.</p>

  <p>Betcher stood still, paralyzed by the shock, and then, sprinting the
  remainder of the distance, he leapt over the low hedge into the road. His car
  was a mass of twisted metal and smouldering wood; and then, by great luck, a
  cyclist policeman came along. He had heard the explosion and, bending over
  his handlebars, was flying toward the spot. He leapt off his machine as he
  came abreast of Arnold.</p>

  <p>"What's happened to your car&mdash;blown up?"</p>

  <p>"It has certainly blown up," said Betcher grimly; "and as certainly I am
  not troubling to look for the bomb that did it!"</p>

  <p>"Bomb?" gasped the rural policeman.</p>

  <p>The question of his wrecked machine was an unimportant one to Betcher
  Long. In a few words, he explained the tragedy and guided the policeman to
  the spot where the man lay.</p>

  <p>"There are car marks in the sunken road," said Betcher, "but unless we
  have an airplane, I doubt whether we can overtake the two gentlemen
  responsible for this little surprise."</p>

  <p>It was five o'clock that night when he came to the Yard and reported, and
  Colonel Macfarlane listened with a darkened brow.</p>

  <p>"The whole thing is inexplicable and, I would have said, impossible," he
  said. "Shelton was hanged at eight, and there is no doubt about his being
  dead. You were unable to trace the motor-cyclist or the car?"</p>

  <p>Betcher shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, neither the car nor the bomb-thrower was seen, but that is very
  easily explained. The car could have turned right and doubled back, joining
  the main road west of Chelmsford. The only machine that passed through the
  village was a tradesman's Ford, evidently a greengrocer's, for there were
  baskets of cabbages and potatoes at the back. The cyclist&mdash;well, I know
  what happened to the cyclist. I want to be mysterious for a week or two.
  Chief, we're up against the Terrible People!"</p>

  <p>Macfarlane frowned at him.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite get you," he said. "Shelton worked on his own. He ran no
  gang, he had no friends. And certainly, as far as we know, there is nobody in
  the world sufficiently interested in the man's fate to care whether he lived
  or died."</p>

  <p>Betcher bit his lip thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"All that is true," he said, "and yet&mdash;well, I'm standing for no
  Gallows Hand; that supernatural stuff doesn't get past me, not by so much as
  a millimetre! There's going to be trouble&mdash;bad trouble! I don't know
  where it's coming from, but it will be hot and fierce and gory.</p>

  <p>The Terrible People will not sit still. They employed the Lancer, knowing
  he was a pretty good shot, to settle me on my way back from Chelmsford; and
  he was easy, because he hated me. When they found he'd missed the target,
  they shot him. If he hadn't missed the target they would have shot him. He
  was marked for death the moment he took on his dirty work. "</p>

  <p>In the months that followed, Betcher Long found a new zest and interest in
  life. The knowledge of his own danger, the certainty that somewhere behind
  this lonely forger existed an organization more terrible than any that he had
  met with or even had read about in the grisly records of police headquarters,
  gave his step a new spring and brought a new brightness to his eye.</p>

  <p>He had trailed the Lancer from the moment he had left Dartmoor; had
  interrogated the people with whom the convict had been brought into touch;
  and at every turn he was puzzled. None of the Lancer's acquaintances could
  give him the slightest clue that would lead to the detection of his
  employers.</p>

  <p>The year that followed was one of fearful happenings. Murder upon murder
  was planned and carried into execution, and yet no word of these deeds
  appeared in any newspaper. Only the wise men in that dark building that
  broods on the Embankment knew of the terror that stalked abroad. Men, famous
  and notorious, were sent into the vales of death, and no startling headlines
  dominated the news pages of the London press.</p>

  <p>For the Gallows Hand went cunningly to its task and left no trace of its
  devilish work.</p>

  <p>And then, fate brought to Arnold Long's life an even more poignant
  interest, and, as it proved, a cause for a fear that had been a stranger to
  him hitherto. For he met the secretary of Miss Revelstoke.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">MISS REVELSTOKE was a lady of great age and with few
  observable fads. She garnished neither her parlour with long-haired dogs of
  diminutive proportions, nor her person with cameo brooches. She preferred
  radio concerts to solitaire, and never bought a car until the demonstrator
  had proved to her satisfaction that the machine could hold the road at
  sixty-five. A tall woman with a lineless yellow face and black, inscrutable
  eyes, she had, so far as Nora Sanders knew, no objectionable characteristics,
  which is remarkable in any lady of wealth who employs a
  companion-secretary.</p>

  <p>The big house in Colville Gardens was from every point of view a perfect
  setting for such a jewel of a woman. Externally it symbolized Victorianism at
  its stodgiest phase, for there was a sunken area to it and a stolid stucco
  porch and step that led up to a highly polished black door. The
  liver-coloured curtains, the flower boxes in the window sills, the two tubs
  of well-trimmed box-bush that flanked the doorway&mdash;all these things
  fitted the external view of Miss Revelstoke.</p>

  <p>The superficial observer imagined horsehair couches of elegant design and
  gilt pier glasses and rosy-patterned carpets beyond and behind the baffling
  curtains. Intimately, Miss Revelstoke belonged to the age in which she lived.
  Even Nora's room was artistically and tastefully furnished, which was also an
  unusual experience for a companion-secretary who had slept under garret roofs
  and had once shared a room with a sentimental housemaid.</p>

  <p>One day in midsummer, Miss Revelstoke sat at her little writing table and
  penned an address in her neat hand, damped the small label with a sponge, and
  fixed it carefully on the oblong parcel.</p>

  <p>"You will find Mr. Monkford a very amusing person," she said, in her
  precise way; "he has the facetiousness which is peculiar to men of his
  stature. Stout men are invariably humorous. Even as a branch manager, he
  erred on the side of flippancy, which, as a rule, is not an asset in a
  banker. The parcel is rather heavy for you?"</p>

  <p>Nora lifted the package. It was lighter in weight than she had
  expected.</p>

  <p>"He will probably ask you to stay to tea. I dine at nine, half an hour
  later. Mr. Henry is coming to dinner, and I feel sure he will never forgive
  me if you are not here."</p>

  <p>The girl laughed at this. It was a tradition, the nearest to a jest that
  Miss Revelstoke could approach, that Nora was the reason, whatever might be
  his excuse, for frequent calls of Miss Revelstoke's good-looking young
  lawyer.</p>

  <p>"Tell Monkford that he need not write&mdash;he is very welcome to this
  horrid negress. I shall be seeing him at 'Little Heartsease' next week. You
  booked the suite?"</p>

  <p>A taxicab carried Nora to Paddington and to the beginning of a new and an
  amazing experience. Life began when she bought a third-class return for
  Marlow-on-Thames, since, at the end of the line, and within the confines of
  that sleepy Georgian town, began her acquaintance with the Terrible People
  and Betcher Long, that unusual detective.</p>

  <p>For her part, "terrible people" would have been illustrated in her mind by
  a picture of uncouth folks who ate with their knives, or that impossible
  family she had met on a trip to the fjords, or at worst the bookmaker and his
  lady wife (one hopes) who lived at No. 705 and came home noisily every
  morning at three and argued thickly with the cabman.</p>

  <p>For the Terrible People were as yet in the stage of secrecy; they were
  mentioned in confidential minutes, as between the Secretary of State and the
  Chief Commissioner of the Police. Only Betcher Long spoke of them freely,
  even cheerfully, just as a man might speak of a plague which happened to be
  in another country. He gave them their title; though in the guarded minutes
  that went criss-crossing between Whitehall and Scotland Yard were heard "Very
  Secret and Confidential. Re a Supposed Illegal Organization Operating to
  Defeat the Ends of Justice."</p>

  <p>Betcher called them plainly the "Terrible People." Sometimes he added
  adjectives of force and colour.</p>

  <p>With no other emotion than one of joy at the prospect of a day in the
  out-of-doors, Nora came to Marlow.</p>

  <p>Harry, the boatman at Meakes, straightened his back, wiped his forehead
  with a bare brown arm, and regarded the inquirer with the respectful interest
  which all boatmen assume so naturally toward all folks who are not equipped
  or costumed for the river.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Monkford's house?"</p>

  <p>He shaded his eyes from the reflected glare of the sun and pointed up
  river. Here the stream turns abruptly toward Temple Lock. In the one bank the
  meadows stretch to the long woods; behind the trees on the other, the tower
  of Bisham Church shows grayly. It was toward Bisham that the boatman
  looked.</p>

  <p>"You can't see the house from here," he said, with an air of
  disappointment which suggested that for the first time in his life he
  realized and regretted the invisibility of Bendham Manor. "It's old&mdash;you
  can see the place if you walk up the path. A red house with twisting
  chimneys."</p>

  <p>He looked at her doubtingly. There were twelve punts to be baled and a
  four-oared skiff to be made ready for a picnic party almost due. She was very
  pretty. It was lady-prettiness, fragile and dainty and white. Red lips and
  gray eyes that held the ghost of a smile. She wore a little black felt hat
  without ornamentation and a blue costume that was nearly black, severe, and
  straight, yet for some reason peculiarly feminine. Also there was a
  suppleness and grace in the slim lady who had arrested his eye as she walked
  toward him along the towpath, long before he had seen her face.</p>

  <p>"It's a long way round by road," he said, emphasizing in his fashion the
  service he was about to offer. "You cross the bridge and take the second lane
  to your right where the war memorial is&mdash;a long way. I'd better row you
  across, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"You're very good," she said.</p>

  <p>She had a nice voice, sweet and rich. Some gentleman's wife, he thought,
  for she was not a flapper. There was a maturity in her manner, a
  self-assurance in the decision she revealed. Nora Sanders was in truth an old
  woman of twenty-two and reconciled to her great age and exceedingly blank
  prospects. Her years troubled her not at all, though the terrible thirties
  lay over the brow of the hill; nor did her emphatic singleness, for she had
  met no man whose quality of mind and heart set her dreaming in the quiet
  dusk. But it was very dreadful to be companion-secretary to a woman of sixty
  and to absorb from day to day her acrid philosophies. She had gone halfway to
  meet middle age (this was her pet illusion), and there was no way out.
  Marriage was only a jump from one rut to another and maybe a worse. Such
  dreams as she had were curiously temperate. If she gave a brevet to her
  fancies, they moved soberly to posts that a woman might hold in some great
  business organization, where the salary was large and the possibilities of
  promotion at least encouraging.</p>

  <p>As Harry went to find oars, her eyes roved up and down the river. The roar
  of the weir was pleasant and soothing, the clang of the clock in old Marlow
  Church as it struck three belonged to the harmonies of the place and the
  time. A racing four came swinging round the bend of the river; the rhythmic
  thud of oars against steel outriggers was a concert in the melody of that
  drowsy summer afternoon.</p>

  <p>Harry brought the boat to the side of the towpath, and she stepped in.</p>

  <p>He was inclined to be informative as he set the nose of the boat
  upstream.</p>

  <p>"...there's a trout in that hole, the biggest in the river. Some say he's
  thirty years old an' more. Lots of young gentlemen have tried to get him, but
  he just laffs at 'um! Got away with more tackle than any fish that ever
  lived. You'll see him to-night; he feeds at a quarter of eight."</p>

  <p>She murmured a polite interest. The "hole" must be imagined as a deep
  depression in the river's bed beneath the placid and unbroken water. Harry's
  tit-bit was to come.</p>

  <p>"That's Shelton's boat." He jerked his head sideways to a weather-beaten
  craft moored to the lawn of an empty house. A whale-decked power boat that
  had once been brave and white and was now water-rusted and uninviting. She
  wondered who Shelton was, and, even as she wondered, he supplied a startling
  scrap of biography.</p>

  <p>"Shelton was hung for killing a copper&mdash;policeman. Biggest forger in
  the world, so the newspapers say&mdash;not that you can believe newspapers.
  They said Marlow was flooded in the spring an' the water hardly came over the
  path!"</p>

  <p>She was looking at him in open-eyed wonder, and from him she turned back
  to scrutinize the tragic craft.</p>

  <p>"Hanged?"</p>

  <p>Harry nodded. He seemed to take credit himself for the operations of
  justice.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't believe it if you read it in a book; Shelton's boat there
  and Mr. Monkford's home just round the corner!"</p>

  <p>"Is that a coincidence?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Evidently it was. All Marlow had been talking about it. Shelton once had a
  little bungalow beyond Temple where he lived alone. That power boat of his
  had held a small printing press, and some of the famous letters of credit
  which had alarmed the financiers of two continents had been created in the
  cabin of the Northward.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing in it, though&mdash;the coincidence, I mean." Harry was
  explicit on this point. "After Shelton was hung, his bungalow and boat was
  sold up. A man named Finney bought the boat, and he sold it to another
  gentleman."</p>

  <p>He explained the vicissitudes and fortunes of the Northward in detail.</p>

  <p>"But where does Mr. Monkford come into all this?" Nora was interested to
  ask.</p>

  <p>"He hung Shelton," said Harry solemnly, "him and Mr. Long, the celebrated
  detective, he's over there now. I saw him rowing about in the dinghy this
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>She knew that Joseph Monkford was a prominent member of the Bankers'
  Association. It was the only subject on which Miss Revelstoke grew voluble.
  The old woman had known Monkford when he was the branch manager of the
  Southern Bank&mdash;she had her account with him. And Mr. Monkford had risen,
  by sheer native genius, to the position of general manager of the Southern
  and to the chairmanship of the board of directors of the Bankers'
  Association.</p>

  <p>"Him and Betcher Long," said Harry, with relish, "hung Shelton. Long found
  him an' was goin' to pinch him when Shelton pulled a gun and killed an
  officer named Lacy, who was with Long. You don't mean to tell me you never
  heard about it, ma'am? Why, it was only a year ago."</p>

  <p>Nora shook her head. She never read horrors of any kind. It was a
  grievance with people she met at Miss Revelstoke's that she knew nothing of
  topical events, and had no view as to whether He was to blame or She was to
  blame in the current cause célèbre.</p>

  <p>The house was in sight now. A rambling Elizabethan mansion of dull red
  brick. It stood back amidst the poplars, a wide green lawn separating the
  building from the river.</p>

  <p>Harry pulled vigorously at one oar, and the boat shot through the small
  landing stage. Here the stream shallowed; the sandy bottom was free of weeds,
  and she saw a school of roach pass leisurely under the boat across the sunlit
  bed. Two men were fishing from the lawn&mdash;one at either end. They looked
  up as the boat came to the bank, and surveyed her absently. Then they
  returned to the contemplation of their red floats. Gathering up the parcel
  she was carrying, Nora reached out her gloved hand and caught the edge of the
  pier.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you, ma'am."</p>

  <p>She had opened her bag and was searching for her purse, as she stood on
  the stage, but Harry pushed off the boat and signalled his farewell.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Monkford will have you brought back, ma'am," he shouted.</p>

  <p>She gave him a little smile which he valued, though he was a married man,
  and made a way across the close-cut lawn.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">THE entrance to the house was on the shore side, and a
  footman took her parcel and ushered her into the big hallway.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Monkford has a gentleman with him at the moment, miss," he said,
  opening the door of a small drawing room, but she had taken two steps to the
  place of waiting when the man she sought appeared in a doorway on the
  opposite side of the hall. He was short, stout, and rather bald. She could
  not help thinking at that moment that nobody less like the nemesis of the
  unfortunate Shelton was imaginable than the jovial, red-faced man, with his
  ludicrous spectacles and his polka-dot waistcoat.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Miss Sanders, come in&mdash;it is Miss Sanders, isn't it? Did
  Miss Revelstoke get that statuette for me? Splendid! What a superstitious
  lady she is, to be sure!"</p>

  <p>Miss Revelstoke and her sometime banker shared one hobby, the collection
  of Roman antiquities. The statuette which Nora had brought had been acquired
  by her from a dealer&mdash;its gruesome character made the transfer to Mr.
  Monkford a perfectly natural one.</p>

  <p>"Come right in. That parcel must have been heavy. If I had known you were
  coming, I'd have sent the car.</p>

  <p>I'd like you to meet a friend of mine&mdash;one of the best&mdash;yes, one
  of the best! "</p>

  <p>He had a trick of repeating his final sentences that amused the girl. A
  stimulating, vital man, who radiated a heartening life force, his friendship
  was as much part of him as the average man's superficial courtesy.</p>

  <p>"Let me take your umbrella"&mdash;he bustled with it to the hat-stand,
  talking all the time&mdash;"an umbrella on a day like this!"</p>

  <p>As she followed him into the big library that overlooked the river, she
  saw, standing by one of the windows and gazing gloomily across the lawn to
  the river, a man she had seen somewhere before. Then, in a flash, she knew
  him and saw the sudden recognition in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Miss Sanders, this is Mr. Long."</p>

  <p>Long! The name was familiar, but for the moment she could not place him.
  And then she remembered the boatman's story and Shelton, who was hanged.
  Betcher Long, the detective! She wondered if Betcher were a Christian name
  bestowed by an eccentric parent.</p>

  <p>He was looking at Nora; his gaze enveloped her, item by item. She felt
  this, yet was not uneasy; her dominant expression was of the power she had
  overlooked when she had seen him first. The tremendous strength of him, the
  queer magnetic qualities of his eyes. Was it imagination, born of the mystery
  of his profession? she wondered. Was she endowing him with ideal qualities?
  She had never met a detective before. They belonged to a terrible and a
  romantic world. He was wonderfully alive, communicating to her a sense of
  immense completeness&mdash;hand and eye, brain and thew, and above all a
  transcendent individuality. She was eager, impatient to know all about him,
  his beginnings, his life, his strange career. And just as she was hoping that
  he would speak and disillusion her, Monkford bustled to the fireplace and
  rang a bell.</p>

  <p>"We'll have tea," he said. "The other matter can wait."</p>

  <p>Betcher Long seemed content to wait. He strolled to the window and resumed
  his staring. The fishermen interested him.</p>

  <p>For a few minutes, Nora was occupied with the object of her call.</p>

  <p>"Miss Revelstoke would have sent the figure by post, but I rather think it
  got on her nerves," she said, with a half-smile.</p>

  <p>The banker was busy unwrapping the parcel. An uncovering of paper wrappers
  showed a small wooden box, and the lid of this he prized off with a paper-
  knife. Beneath was a mass of wooden shavings into which the hand of the
  collector dived. It emerged holding a small object wrapped in silver tissue,
  and, when this was removed: "Wonderful!" He was awe-stricken.</p>

  <p>And wonderful it was&mdash;a nude figure of a negress, about six inches
  high. Betcher himself found the statuette of greater interest than the
  landscape, and came slowly across the room.</p>

  <p>"Perfect! The workmanship... exquisite!" Monkford gasped his admiration in
  disjointed words. The woman was carved from ebony&mdash;erect, chin raised,
  defiant. The tiny hands held across her an ivory sword. Girt about the bare
  waist was a metal belt from which hung an empty scabbard, the only other
  metal being a thin golden fillet about the woolly head.</p>

  <p>"I don't see the inscription."</p>

  <p>"It is underneath, on the base of the pedestal," said Nora, and Monkford
  turned the figure upside down. And now the inscription was decipherable,
  though the characters were almost microscopic in their smallness.</p>

  <p>"Latin," said Monkford, unnecessarily. "Can you read it, Long?"</p>

  <p>To her surprise, the detective nodded. He scanned the writing, his lips
  moving, and then he read aloud:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">I am Death who waits at the end of all roads. Men see me and
  forget their happiness, straightway falling upon their swords. Beware, 0
  Stranger, lest for love of me you too die by your own hand!</p>

  <p>Betcher Long was watching her as he read. Though she could not see his
  face, she had no doubt. When he had finished reading, Monkford chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Great! That is unique&mdash;almost! They have one in the Cluny
  Museum&mdash;the Black Fate. She's supposed to possess all sorts of mystical
  powers... genuine, I'll swear. There are three in Europe and one in America.
  You can tell your lady, Miss Sanders, that I'm a proud and happy man."</p>

  <p>"Black Fate?" Betcher's brows met in a frown. "Black Fate&mdash;hum!"</p>

  <p>Again he read the inscription. When he finished and looked up, his eyes
  were fixed on hers.</p>

  <p>And then she asked a question that was out before she could govern her
  tongue. It was apropos of nothing. It was, she knew, in execrable taste, but
  a force within her, beyond her own power to resist, impelled the words.</p>

  <p>"Who was Shelton?"</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence; her heart beat wildly at her own temerity. They
  saw the colour come and go from her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm so sorry&mdash;I don't know what made me ask such a stupid
  thing!"</p>

  <p>Monkford's face was gray; there was a wild, hurt look in his eyes. From
  being a figure of rubicund fun, he had become a worn and tragic man.</p>

  <p>Whatever effect her question might have upon Monkford, the corner of the
  detective's mouth twitched in secret amusement.</p>

  <p>"Shelton was a forger who killed a policeman," he said simply. "I arrested
  him, and he shot the officer who was with me. He was hanged."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his silent host, and, watching him, Nora saw in that glance
  a hint of worry.</p>

  <p>"Nobody guessed he would pull a gun: I suppose he went mad. We wanted him
  for forgery and fraud. He took more money out of the American and English
  banks than they like to remember, and we could never get him."</p>

  <p>Again she saw him look anxiously at Monkford.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Monkford and I went after him&mdash;we laid a trap and he fell into
  it. That gun play was certainly a surprise. If his hanging is on any man's
  hands, it is on mine. I ought to have killed him before he fired."</p>

  <p>She knew instinctively that he was telling an oft-repeated story; and that
  the moral of the story was Monkford's innocence of responsibility.</p>

  <p>Somehow, she could not understand why he needed excusing. Even if the
  stout man had been consciously responsible, why should he blame himself for
  the death of a man who had butchered an officer of the law in cold blood? But
  Betcher's next words explained a great deal.</p>

  <p>"Naturally, Mr. Monkford worried himself sick about it all. He got an
  idea&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;well&mdash;we'll change the subject. Here's the tea&mdash;let us
  talk about something else."</p>

  <p>Monkford's voice was harsh and unsteady. Not the flippancy of words could
  hide his emotion. His face had paled to an unhealthy gray, the hands that
  raised the statuette and examined the inscription were shaking. His very
  interest in his new possession was badly simulated.</p>

  <p>"The Black Fate! Cheerful, upon my soul!" His chuckle was thin and
  mirthless. "I'll take back what I said about that superstitious lady of
  yours, Miss Sanders. But I'll not die by falling on my sword, or even on my
  fountain pen!"</p>

  <p>After tea she strolled out on to the lawn. There was a wait of two hours
  before her train went back to town, and she thought the men wanted to be
  alone. In this surmise she was wrong. She had reached the water's edge and
  was standing watching a small pike's lightning dart at a school of minnows,
  when she heard a voice behind her and turned to meet Arnold Long.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Monkford has gone up to his room to lie down," he said.</p>

  <p>"And it was all my fault." She was the picture and tone of penitence. "Why
  I ever mentioned that wretched man I don't know. And I just hate
  murders&mdash;I never read them or talk about them."</p>

  <p>"I read nothing else," he said, and rubbed his nose irritably.
  "Morbid&mdash;I've got that way lately."</p>

  <p>She felt a return of the fatal curiosity of the afternoon. "You really
  don't look like a detective," she said, and Betcher sighed.</p>

  <p>"I've come to the conclusion that I'm the worst detective in the world,"
  he said; "and yet, the first time I saw you, I guessed I was nearly the
  biggest. But it was luck, after all."</p>

  <p>"When did you see me first?"</p>

  <p>She told herself that the challenge was a stupid one, and the reproach in
  his eyes made the colour come to her face.</p>

  <p>"Southern Bank," he said laconically. "You remember&mdash;betcher!"</p>

  <p>She was furious with him, but only for a second.</p>

  <p>"A year ago I was a light-hearted young man. I'm now a hundred&mdash;maybe
  a hundred and fifty."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He took a cigarette from his case and, asking her permission with a lift
  of his eyebrows, lit it.</p>

  <p>"Because," he said, as he threw the match into the river, "they are going
  to kill Monkford next week, and I don't exactly know how I can stop 'em."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">SHE gazed at him, horror and incredulity in every line of
  her face.</p>

  <p>"You don't really mean that?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm telling you this because I know you and because you know me.
  Understanding at first sight is more common than love at first sight. I knew
  you the day I saw you in the Southern Bank. You're an affinity. I hate the
  word, because it has had its bloom worn off in the divorce courts. Come for a
  row and forget all about Mr. Monkford. He's still alive."</p>

  <p>She got into the dinghy without a word, secretly pleased to be with him.
  She could not grasp the full significance of his calm survey of Monkford's
  fate. And yet she knew that he was not the type of man who would exaggerate
  for the sake of making a sensation. Her mental attitude toward this stranger
  amazed her. In the shadow of his influence she felt she could relax, put down
  all the guards and screens that women erect to keep the world at bay. She had
  never been susceptible to strong prejudices; her nature was cautious;
  experience had made her a little suspicious of men and women alike. She could
  hardly believe that it was possible in her to conceive so sudden an interest
  in a man of whose existence she had been ignorant an hour before.</p>

  <p>"How old are you?"</p>

  <p>He was pulling to midstream when he fired the question at her head.</p>

  <p>"Nearly twenty-three&mdash;I am very old," she said, and despised herself
  for casting so clumsy a bait.</p>

  <p>"You don't look old. I thought you were about twenty when I saw you." He
  looked over her shoulder as he spoke, watching the house recede. "That's the
  queer thing about beauty&mdash;it destroys age. A beautiful woman is any age
  you want her to be; not that I've wanted&mdash;much."</p>

  <p>She sat up, her eyes kindling with laughter.</p>

  <p>"Are you in the habit of&mdash;of being so frank with all the women you
  know?" she asked. Modesty demanded that she should add: "All people
  are&mdash;well&mdash;nice-looking who have a healthy skin."</p>

  <p>"I knew a woman in town who had a peach skin. She was cross-eyed and had a
  nose like an elephant," he said. "No, I don't have a great deal to do with
  women. I knew Kate Lacrosse&mdash;she was pretty. Golden hair and wonderful
  features. Last time I saw her she was painting angels down in Aylesbury."</p>

  <p>"Painting... Where is Aylesbury?" she demanded, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Convict prison for women. I got her twenty years," said the rower, with
  melancholy satisfaction. "Her line was blackmail."</p>

  <p>She was shocked at this, but he went on to make a startling statement.</p>

  <p>"I know everything&mdash;except about women. They get me guessing. When I
  was a boy I read the encyclopaedia through twice. I know everything. It has
  been useful as a policeman. Do you mind my saying that you're beautiful?"</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"I rather like it," she confessed.</p>

  <p>The boat was headed downstream now. She had no thought for anything but
  this strange personality.</p>

  <p>"You've got the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen in a woman," he said
  after a pause.</p>

  <p>She raised a warning finger.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Long, I believe you are trying to flirt with me," she said
  solemnly.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not." He was telling the truth, as she knew. "I'm just remarking.
  You're engaged?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No. I am unique. I have never been engaged." He drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"That's certainly unique," he said, and, shipping his sculls, reached out
  and caught hold of something. Looking round, she saw to her surprise that it
  was the murderer's boat.</p>

  <p>"I'll show you something," he said, and jumped on board, stooping to grip
  her hand in his.</p>

  <p>The air of neglect was more striking nearer at hand. The planking of the
  whale-deck was rotting; the well was inches deep in water that rolled and
  gurgled with every motion of the boat as they moved.</p>

  <p>"He had his press in here." Betcher pulled back the sliding door of the
  poop cabin. "Ran it off batteries&mdash;the batteries are still there. Come
  inside."</p>

  <p>She followed him, stooping, into the darkness of the cabin and he lit a
  match.</p>

  <p>"How's that for high-class prophecy?" he asked.</p>

  <p>On the woodwork of the cabin walls a string of dates had been carved.
  There were nine in all.</p>

  <ul class="smcap"
      style="margin-left: 40%">
    <li>June 1, 1854. J. X. T. L.</li>

    <li>Sept. 6, 1862.</li>

    <li>Feb. 9, 1886.</li>

    <li>March 11, 1892.</li>

    <li>Sept. 4, 1896.</li>

    <li>Sept. 12, 1898.</li>

    <li>Aug. 30, 1901.</li>

    <li>July 18, 1923.</li>

    <li>Aug. 1, 1924.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Against the date July 18, 1923, a small, plain cross had been carved.</p>

  <p>"High-class prophecy; he's got Ezekiel beaten," murmured Betcher Long, and
  shook his head in admiration.</p>

  <p>The girl was perplexed.</p>

  <p>"But did he carve those dates?" she asked. "What do they mean?"</p>

  <p>"Give a lot to know&mdash;for sure," he added cautiously. "July 18,
  1923&mdash;that's easy. He was hanged that day!"</p>

  <p>She drew a sudden breath and shrank back. The light of the long wax match
  went out; for a second they were in the darkness, and then, with a wild and
  uncontrollable sense of fear, she pushed past him through the door into the
  sunlight. Presently he followed and pulled the door tight. She gathered from
  his attitude that he was the present proprietor of the Northward, and this
  proved to be the case, though none of the locals knew.</p>

  <p>"The carving was only discovered last year when I bought the boat and
  started to strip the panels&mdash;you saw where they came off? The panel over
  that interestin' memento wasn't screwed to the wall. It was just hinged. When
  I started in to investigate I found the list."</p>

  <p>"But he couldn't have anticipated the date of his death?" she urged.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No. The Terrible People did that."</p>

  <p>Nora looked at him straightly. Was he jesting? More than a little she
  suspected laughter behind the most portentous of his words.</p>

  <p>"I have never heard of those," she said at last.</p>

  <p>"Heard of witch-doctors and voodoo men? Listen, young lady. Step down into
  the boat&mdash;we're too close to shore here."</p>

  <p>He was not joking. His eyes were searching the tangled lawn before the
  empty house. He stood squarely in the centre of the dinghy, both hands
  resting on his hips, but even when he extended one of these toward her, he
  did not look in her direction&mdash;his attention was for the house and the
  drawn blinds and the little shrubbery near the tradesman's path.</p>

  <p>For a second her flesh crept. She had a terrifying sense of danger; she
  felt the presence of an unseen watcher, the menace of hateful eyes.</p>

  <p>"Imagination&mdash;there's nothing there."</p>

  <p>He was speaking as though he read her thoughts. "Somebody was there last
  night. I had cotton across the doorway, and it was broken to-day!"</p>

  <p class="first">HE MUSED on this, arriving the boat against the stream with
  long, powerful strokes. They passed the lawn of Benham Abbey, and then he
  guided the boat to the shade of trees that overhung the water and, gripping a
  branch, held the dinghy steady. And as usual, when he spoke, he went off at a
  tangent.</p>

  <p>"It takes a clever man to live a double life. Shelton lived six that I
  knew. There used to be a fellow who wrote stories for the <i>Child's
  Magazine</i>, all about the little dogs that find their master lying in the
  snow. A fellow named Grinstead Jackson. His other name was Shelton. And
  another man who wrote a book about the mind&mdash;that was Shelton. Down at
  Lambeth there was a small printer's business run by a man named Simon Cole.
  Mr. Cole and Mr. Shelton went about under the same hat. In Oxfordshire a
  poultry farmer used to advertise eggs and birds for the table. He did a good
  business and had two dozen people working for him. And more hens. H. P.
  Pearce was his name in the telephone book. At Scotland Yard, we called him
  Shelton. Up by Temple Lock an elderly gentleman had a bungalow and a power
  boat. He used to fish a lot&mdash;one of the best barbel fishers on the
  river. Walter James Evanleigh was the name on his letters&mdash;most of the
  recording angels opened the page under Shelton. That's what I know about him.
  What I don't know would fill a big shelf in Mr. Monkford's library."</p>

  <p>"Was he married?" she asked, fascinated.</p>

  <p>"Never appeared to be," said Betcher. He fixed her for a second with a
  glance that seemed to go searching behind her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Of course, he couldn't have prophesied his own death&mdash;Oh!"</p>

  <p>She suddenly remembered the last date, August 1st&mdash;and it was now
  July 23d! "What is happening on August the first?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said her companion, and then, before she could press her question,
  he went on again:</p>

  <p>"Nobody really knows about the Terrible People&mdash;except me, and I know
  next to nothing. You smell 'em now and again&mdash;get a sort of glimpse of
  'em. Old Shelton made a million out of the banks, but the high cost of living
  six lives ate it up. Maybe he played the races. Most crooks are mad in one
  direction or another. He paid high for his messengers. It was costly to send
  people to America to cash letters of credit&mdash;why, once he ran a man from
  New York to Sacramento by special train, just stopping off at the big places
  to collect, an' going on to the next. The agent was back in London before the
  first squeal came. Clever&mdash; but it cost money. Still&mdash;a million's a
  lot. Behind him all the time were the Terrible People. Mr. Monkford had a
  brother who went to Ilfracombe for a holiday; that was the week after I
  caught Shelton. This brother was drowned. They found him in his bathing suit
  on the beach early one morning. Mr. Monkford thinks it was an accident. It
  was. They got the wrong Monkford!"</p>

  <p>She looked at him open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"Murdered?" she said hollowly.</p>

  <p>Betcher nodded.</p>

  <p>"Got the wrong Monkford," he said, and for a second the skin about his
  eyes wrinkled. Something had amused him.</p>

  <p>"Going up to town by the six-fifteen? I'll be going, too. I travel third
  class. I'm democratic&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She saw him stiffen and his head thrust forward toward the wilderness of
  bushes that fringed the bank. One hand dropped to his pocket. The other held
  rigidly to the branch of the tree. Again her heart raced; again her skin
  crept. He was staring wide-eyed at the bushes&mdash;she thought she heard a
  strange and stealthy rustle of sound.</p>

  <p>The dinghy was slowly turning, and she discovered why, for the wrist of
  the hand that held the branch was also turning. Presently the motion stopped
  and he rose, so light on his feet that the little boat scarcely rocked. As he
  stood now he was immediately between her and the place where she had located
  the sound.</p>

  <p>His head drooped, he was listening; then, as unexpectedly as he rose, he
  sat down again, put out the oars and drew the dinghy to midstream.</p>

  <p>"Terrible people!" He was speaking to himself.</p>

  <p>"Terrible people&mdash;there's something doing and I don't know what it
  is."</p>

  <p>He said no more of them, offered nothing in the way of explanation, and
  rowed out toward the opposite bank, as she thought.</p>

  <p>"Seen our neighbour?" he asked, in his abrupt way.</p>

  <p>"Ought to see him&mdash;he's one of the sights of Marlow. I call him
  Hercules. Folks round here got another name for him. He was in the bank the
  day we caught Shelton, and considering he's naturally languid, he certainly
  mixed it! These languid birds sometimes fight well. When I was at
  Cambridge&mdash;" He stopped here for no apparent reason.</p>

  <p>Presently the untidy fringe of bushes came to an abrupt end and she sat
  open-mouthed at the loveliness which flashed into view. The house behind the
  inevitable lawn was smaller than Benham Abbey, and the lawn itself the merest
  parallelogram of vivid green that served as a frame for the most beautiful
  garden she had ever seen. Crimson and gold and cobalt blue, deep purples and
  dusty reds flamed in harmonious confusion. The house was half hidden under
  crimson rambler and wisteria. Two long stone-pillared pergolas ran from the
  river to the house, flanking the lawn, their beams hidden under climbing
  roses. Near to the edge of the water was a red-and-white striped umbrella
  tent, and this protected a man who was stretched in a deep cane chair. He
  rose wearily as the dinghy came inshore, a thin man with a long, weak face,
  who screwed a monocle into his eye and surveyed the approaching visitors, his
  face a picture of vacuity.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Long," he drawled, as they stepped ashore.</p>

  <p>He offered a limp hand to Mr. Long, but his pale eyes were all for the
  girl.</p>

  <p>"I'd like you to meet Miss Sanders&mdash;this is Mr. Crayley."</p>

  <p>"Jackson Crayley," murmured the lean man. "How do&mdash;sit down, won't
  you?"</p>

  <p>His hand was so inanimate that Mary would have found his empty glove more
  human.</p>

  <p>"I thought Miss Sanders would like to see your garden."</p>

  <p>"It is wonderful," said the girl enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>"Ya-as! not bad." The owner seemed reluctant to admit the beauty of his
  pleasant lands. "Got a good head gardener. Show the young lady
  round&mdash;pick anything you like, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Almost before they had moved away, he had sunk down in his chair and was
  immersed again in his newspaper.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of him?"</p>

  <p>Nora hesitated.</p>

  <p>"He seems rather&mdash;tired," she said, and Betcher chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Born that way. He's nothing much. Only&mdash;well, curious thing was that
  he was in the bank when we pinched Shelton, an' helped arrest him&mdash;as
  much as he could help anybody. Sort of dived at him when he broke loose from
  me. Of course, Shelton pushed him over&mdash;that kind of man is made to be
  pushed over. Mr. Monkford likes him. He's a fashion lizard and only here in
  the season. Just come back from Deauville&mdash;or maybe just off to Aix. You
  going to Heartsease for the golf week?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," she said, in surprise, "but I didn't know that that was a very
  fashionable gathering."</p>

  <p>He said something half aloud which she did not catch. She gathered from
  his tone that it was disparaging to the game of golf.</p>

  <p>When they returned to their host they found him parleying with a lady who,
  from the depths of a luxurious punt, was apparently fixing an appointment.
  Nora had one glimpse of her as she paddled away. A rather plain girl,
  beautifully dressed.</p>

  <p>"Deuced awkward, people asking me if they can see my garden," grumbled Mr.
  Crayley, and then, conscious of his lack of grace, he added, hastily for him:
  "I mean&mdash;asking if she can come on Thursday and bring some
  friends&mdash;sort of hotel idea&mdash;public gardens and all that sort of
  thing. Going, Miss&mdash;er ?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you for letting me see your lovely flowers." She shook the lifeless
  hand and went down into the dinghy.</p>

  <p>"Come some other day," called Mr. Jackson Crayley, already in his chair.
  He did not disguise, either in his voice or attitude, his great relief at
  their departure.</p>

  <p>Betcher's face was set in a smile that was almost satanic as he rowed her
  back to the abbey.</p>

  <p>"What amuses you?" she asked, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Fashion lizard&mdash;did you see his yellow spats? Men have been
  smothered for less!"</p>

  <p>Evidently Monkford had changed his mind about resting. He was pacing up
  and down the bank when they came back to the abbey.</p>

  <p>The fishermen still sat at each end of the lawn, their attention
  concentrated upon their floats, and Mary wondered if they ever caught
  anything and why they chose this clear and shallow water for their sport.</p>

  <p>"I'll be seeing Miss Revelstoke at Little Heartsease next week," said
  Monkford, as they walked to the house. "Tell her she must take up
  golf&mdash;never too late, never too late!"</p>

  <p>She went to the station by car. Betcher kept her waiting a little while
  before he came out with his friend. The grounds at the back of the house were
  narrow. Three times the width of the carriage drive separated the manor from
  the red wall that hid the road. Waiting in the machine for the big man's
  reappearance, she had time to observe this wall. It had not long been built;
  was unusually high, and along its parapet stretched a triple row of revolving
  spikes. By the big green gates&mdash;also new&mdash;stood a sturdily built
  man. He was smoking a short briar pipe and was seemingly as unoccupied as the
  fishermen. Nora looked from him to the wall and wondered.</p>

  <p>On the way to the station, Betcher was in his most inquisitive mood. How
  long had she been working? What did she do? She had a somewhat humiliating
  record of posts held and lost. Her typing was indifferent&mdash;her shorthand
  negligible. She spoke three languages well&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Danish?"</p>

  <p>He stopped dead in the centre of the booking hall to ask the question.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;why Danish? German, French, Italian, and a little Spanish."</p>

  <p>In spite of his boasted spirit of democracy, he ushered her into a first-
  class carriage.</p>

  <p>As the train moved out of the station toward Bourne End, he asked her if
  she kept secrets.</p>

  <p>"Most people think they can, but most people are born reporters, an' a
  reporter just lives to tell somebody else."</p>

  <p>He opened the carriage window and looked out&mdash;repeated the process at
  the opposite window, and then sat down facing her. His blue eyes were
  laughing.</p>

  <p>"I've got a joke on a fellow," he explained. "There's a man from the Yard
  watching me&mdash;just friendly. He's travellin' in the guard's van; there's
  a little projecting window so you can see up and down the train. Ever read
  philosophy, Miss Sanders?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"A little; I can also keep a secret," she added invitingly.</p>

  <p>"Ever read Leibniz on Causation? No, I thought not. Why is this train
  going? Because up in Derbyshire a man went down a mine and dug out a heap of
  coal. Why did he go down the mine? Because he has a wife to keep. Therefore,
  his wife is pullin' this train&mdash;got that?"</p>

  <p>There was a flaw in the logic, but she did not interrupt. Moreover, he was
  well aware of the irregularity.</p>

  <p>"First causes&mdash;go back to 'em. You can't get Shelton's because you
  don't know what his trouble was. But when they dropped him through the trap,
  a new series of First Causes got down to their job. I'm telling you this
  because I'm fond of you. Not in love with you&mdash;don't get ideas, Nora.
  Just fond of you!"</p>

  <p>She listened, too dumbfounded to speak. He went on:</p>

  <p>"Up at the Yard they laugh about me and my Terrible People, but where is
  the judge who sentenced him? Dead! Where is the prosecuting lawyer? Dead!
  Where is the hangman? Dead! I'm alive an' Monkford is alive&mdash;"</p>

  <p><i>Crash!</i></p>

  <p>The glass of the window splintered into fragments; something whizzed past
  with the drone of an angry bee; the roof of the carriage dropped a shower of
  splinters.</p>

  <p>Betcher's grin was fiercely joyous.</p>

  <p>"The man that fired that rifle is dead&mdash;I'll betcher!" The train
  stopped at Bourne End, and Betcher took a characteristic farewell.</p>

  <p>"Just going back to identify the body," he said cheerfully, and then, with
  a glance at the girl's white face, he went on quickly: "A little joke!
  There's a rifle range about a mile away, and I'm betting I shall find a
  left-handed recruit doing a little anti-aircraft practice."</p>

  <p>She was not deceived; nevertheless, she forced a smile, and was still
  smiling mechanically as the train drew out.</p>

  <p>"Theatrical fool!" said Betcher cold-bloodedly, as he saw the end carriage
  go out of sight round a bend. "Sensation maker and girl scarer!"</p>

  <p>He was addressing himself in this strain as the station taxi carried him
  back to the place from which the shot had been fired. It took very little
  finding. The train was passing a railside but used as a store by the
  platelayers when the bullet struck. There was no house in sight&mdash;running
  parallel with the line was a field of oats that went back to the road along
  which his taxi had driven, with the sergeant of police he had commandeered at
  Bourne End.</p>

  <p>He expected to find his man near to the rail, and here he was wrong. There
  was a pond in the field surrounded by a low mound which barely rose to the
  height of the growing crops. Here, amidst a riot of flowering weeds, he saw
  the still figure of a man. He was poorly dressed, a tramp of some kind, and
  an ex-army man, for there were three soiled medal ribbons on his tattered
  waistcoat.</p>

  <p>"Shot from behind," said Betcher, after a brief examination. "Poor devil!
  What is that book, Sergeant?"</p>

  <p>The officer passed the shabby memorandum book he had picked up, and
  Betcher Long turned the greasy pages. It was the pencilled entry at the end
  which interested him.</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:40%"><i>Third coch from engin.<br>
  Secon winder<br>
  Dont shoot if girl at winder.</i></p><br>

  <p>Long examined the remaining pages. He found a name.</p>

  <p>"Joe Hanford," and two addresses, one in Sussex, the other in a London
  street.</p>

  <p>"He was methodical, this fellow," said Betcher thoughtfully, "and being
  methodical, he entered his instructions. Now, how the devil did the
  information get here?" He looked round, and, as he did so, a splash of light
  appeared on the shoulder of a hill three miles away. Six times it
  quivered.</p>

  <p>"B-C-N-F-L-D," spelt Betcher. "Beaconsfield!"</p>

  <p>The unknown signaller was sending a mirror message to somebody. It might
  be a detachment of Territorials engaged in harmless military practice.
  Presently the light flickered again.</p>

  <p>"L-N-G S-R-C-H-G F-L-D."</p>

  <p>"Long searching field!" Betcher would have given a lot for a pair of field
  glasses as powerful as those which the mysterious watcher was using.</p>

  <p>That was the last signal he saw. Evidently the young man watcher had seen
  Betcher's face turn toward the hill and had realized his message was being
  read.</p>

  <p>The detective made a rough calculation. The range of heliograph was very
  wide, and the murderer might be well clear of Marlow Town and yet be able to
  read the warning. There was probably no telephone nearer than Bourne End. He
  must take his chance. But he could not afford to neglect even the vaguest
  possibility, and, leaving the sergeant with the body, he hurried back to the
  road, and the taxi flew on its return journey.</p>

  <p>There was a long delay before he could get in touch with the Beaconsfield
  police, and then he heard what he had expected.</p>

  <p>"Cars are passing through here at the rate of ten a minute," said the
  officer in charge. "Can you give me any idea of what it looks like?"</p>

  <p>"Get a man to take every number that goes through in the next quarter of
  an hour," said Betcher.</p>

  <p>There was very faint hope that this record would lead to any discovery. In
  all probability, the machine had already passed through Beaconsfield before
  he had put the police on their guard.</p>

  <p>It was after dark when he left Bourne End, and near to midnight when every
  newspaper in London received a paragraph with an urgent request that it might
  be inserted in the news columns:</p><br>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">Warning to Ex-Soldiers</p>

  <p class="quote">There is in this country an organization which offers a
  large reward to unemployed ex-soldiers, particularly men who are marksmen,
  the services required being of an illegal and felonious character.
  Ex-soldiers are warned that it is fatal for them to accept any such
  commission, apart from the inevitable consequences of their act if they are
  detected by the police. Ex-soldiers receiving any such offer should
  immediately communicate with Inspector Long, Room 709, New Scotland Yard. The
  sum of Â£500 will be paid for any information which will lead to the arrest
  and conviction of the said employers.</p><br>

  <p>Mr. Jackson Crayley, at breakfast the following morning, opened his
  newspaper, fixed his monocle, and read the paragraph. And as he read, he
  stroked his long yellow moustache thoughtfully. He rose and, leaving his
  breakfast untasted, strolled into his handsome library that overlooked the
  garden which had been the delight of Nora Sanders's eyes. Taking up the
  telephone, he gave a number, and presently a voice answered him.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen the newspapers?" he asked, and, when the reply came:</p>

  <p>"We shall have to cut off the military gentlemen," he drawled. "Betcher is
  going to be very difficult."</p>

  <p>He listened whilst the person at the other end replied, and then:</p>

  <p>"Yes, I quite agree&mdash;next week, I think. We shall probably be able to
  get them both together."</p>

  <p>And he went back to his breakfast with a feeling of comfort; for the voice
  that had spoken to him had pronounced the doom of Betcher Long.</p>

  <p>Down at the Telephone Exchange, a Scotland Yard man had cut in and
  listened to every word. But he was no wiser at the end of it, for the
  conversation had been carried on in the Danish language.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">NOTHING ever excited Miss Revelstoke. She had that
  imperturbable type of mind which would accept an earthquake as an interesting
  phenomenon of nature, and it was told of her that, in one of the worst air
  raids that London experienced, she had not so much as put down the fine
  sewing she was engaged in when the warning came.</p>

  <p>She listened now with a certain detached interest to the girl's story.</p>

  <p>"Highly dramatic," she said drily. "Really, Nora, you are in danger of
  becoming notorious! What was the name of this peculiar detective?" And when
  Nora told her, she nodded. "I remember; he was engaged in the Shelton
  case."</p>

  <p>Until then the girl had not told her of her other queer experience, but
  now she narrated almost all that had happened that afternoon.</p>

  <p>"I hope your spine crept when you went into that dreadful boat," said Miss
  Revelstoke grimly. "It must have been delightfully thrilling. Mr. Long rather
  interests me; we must have him up to dinner one night, but, in the meantime,
  my own dinner is waiting, and poor Mr. Henry is beside himself with
  impatience."</p>

  <p>Frederick Henry, man of law and a dabbler in letters, was one of those
  negative quantities which had neither attracted nor repelled Nora. He was a
  nice-spoken young man, rather good-looking, and reputedly clever in his
  profession; and the legend that his frequent visits to Colville Gardens had
  their cause in his admiration for Nora Sanders was not even irritating to the
  girl. She liked Mr. Henry, because he was not the sort of man that one could
  dislike. He was too inactive, much too negative, to arouse any very strong
  feeling.</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour later she followed Miss Revelstoke into the dining
  room. Henry was standing with his back to the empty fire grate, his hands
  behind him, his brown eyes surveying the carpet, and he seemed to the girl to
  be revolving some abstruse problem of law.</p>

  <p>And that apparently was the fact, for he started as Miss Revelstoke came
  in, and apologized.</p>

  <p>"I've had rather a puzzling case sent to me," he said, as he pulled out a
  chair for his hostess, "and a gruesome case at that! You've heard of
  Wallis?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't had that pleasure," said Miss Revelstoke. "But I may suppose
  that he is a famous character, because only such are called and recognized by
  their surnames."</p>

  <p>"Notorious' is the better word," said Mr. Henry, a little grimly, as he
  sat down and opened his serviette. "He was, in fact, the public hangman."</p>

  <p>Miss Revelstoke turned her imperturbable gaze upon him.</p>

  <p>"Wallis lived at Oldham, and we happen to be agents for his solicitors,"
  Henry went on, and then, quickly: "If you object to this unpleasant subject,
  I will talk about butterflies."</p>

  <p>He addressed the girl rather than Miss Revelstoke, and smilingly she shook
  her head.</p>

  <p>"It appears that, although he was rather a dissolute person, he was to
  some extent thrifty. He had some house property in London&mdash;three little
  cottages in Bermondsey, and until his death nobody knew he was married; at
  least, nobody knew that he had married twice without going through the
  formality of obtaining a divorce from his first wife. He left no will, and it
  looks as if there will be a lawsuit."</p>

  <p>Interest in the late Mr. Wallis passed soon after, and the talk drifted to
  Marlow.</p>

  <p>"There you have made an impression, my dear," said Miss Revelstoke. "I had
  Monkford on the 'phone to me, and he was almost ecstatic about your charm and
  colouring and general excellence."</p>

  <p>"About me?" asked Nora, in surprise. "Why, he hardly looked at me! You
  probably misunderstood him, Miss Revelstoke. He must have been talking about
  the Black Fate."</p>

  <p>"Hullo! What is the Black Fate?" asked Henry, looking up from his
  plate.</p>

  <p>Miss Revelstoke described in a few pungent and sardonic words the
  statuette which she had sent her banker.</p>

  <p>"So you met Jackson Crayley, did you?" asked Miss Revelstoke. "What did
  you think of him?"</p>

  <p>Nora hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Well, he was not very impressive," she compromised.</p>

  <p>"I should say he was not!" said Henry indignantly. "In fact, I know of
  nobody less imposing than Jackson."</p>

  <p>"He lives an entirely selfish life," said Miss Revelstoke. "Oh, yes, I
  know him very well indeed."</p>

  <p>Evidently Mr. Crayley was not very popular, either with her employer or
  the lawyer. And then, as conversation flagged, Nora Sanders did something
  which she regretted. She spoke of the Terrible People. There was no reason
  why she should not, but she had a conviction in her mind that the story
  Arnold Long had told her was, so to speak, for private circulation only, and
  she could not escape the uncomfortable feeling that she had betrayed a
  confidence. So strong was this sense that she made, as she thought, a
  blundering effort to turn the talk back to Mr. Monkford. The dark eyes of
  Miss Revelstoke surveyed her keenly.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid your policeman has made rather an impression on you, Nora,"
  she said good-humouredly. "You have an idea that you should not have told us
  about the Terrible People?"</p>

  <p>This strange woman had the extraordinary gift of reading thought, a gift
  which had often embarrassed the girl, and she flushed red as she realized how
  surely Anna Revelstoke had probed her mind. Henry was laughing softly, and
  she wondered why, till he spoke.</p>

  <p>"You needn't be worried about telling us these awful secrets," he said.
  "I've already heard a whisper. But the whole thing is too absurd for words.
  Shelton, on whose life I'm more or less an authority&mdash;I've probably the
  largest collection of data outside Scotland Yard&mdash;was essentially a
  soloist. He had no friends, no relations, and no intimate associates. That is
  why he was able to keep the police at bay for so many years."</p>

  <p>He addressed the two women generally.</p>

  <p>"Organized revenge is unknown in this country," he went on. "After all,
  why should anybody wish to come back on the judge, the prosecuting counsel,
  and the hangman who were instrumental in sending Shelton to his doom? The
  only people who would bear them animosity are those who bore toward him some
  strong personal affection&mdash;some relation, and we know that he had no
  relation in the world."</p>

  <p>"For which he ought to have been grateful," said Miss Revelstoke with a
  sigh.</p>

  <p>"Vendetta is unknown in this country," Henry went on, "and certainly
  vendetta carried on by men who risk their lives for the sake of avenging a
  man who cannot possibly reward them, not even with his gratitude, is
  unthinkable."</p>

  <p>"Did your Mr. Long tell you of anything that had happened&mdash;any
  particular deeds that the Terrible People had committed?" asked Miss
  Revelstoke.</p>

  <p>"No," said Nora; "only he feared&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Again she was saying too much. But happily Henry came to her rescue.</p>

  <p>"Feared for Monkford. That is an open secret, too," he said, with a smile.
  "I don't suppose he fears for himself, because he's not that kind of man, so
  far as I know him."</p>

  <p>"Monkford only did his duty&mdash;what nonsense to think he is
  threatened!" said Miss Revelstoke impatiently. "Really, Nora, I must meet
  your detective&mdash;he is of a type which has been extinct since the
  excellent novels of Gaboriau went out of fashion!"</p>

  <p>"He's really very nice." The girl was spurred to his defence. "And not a
  bit melodramatic."</p>

  <p>Henry was looking at her thoughtfully, fingering his little black
  moustache.</p>

  <p>"I can endorse that," he said. "Betcher is eccentric and has methods which
  are wholly at variance with the usual systems of detection, but he is not at
  all a sensationalist."</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" asked Miss Revelstoke, and then Nora learnt for the first
  time of Arnold Long's wealthy associations.</p>

  <p>"One of these days he'll be a baronet and have the best part of two
  million pounds," said Henry, "which accounts for a lot of his unpopularity at
  Scotland Yard. They are scared of a charge of favouritism."</p>

  <p>Nora Sanders was looking forward to the remainder of the evening with no
  great eagerness. Her employer was an enthusiastic player of picquet, and Nora
  was usually her opponent. But to-night the yellow-faced lady could dispense
  with her. She had a considerable amount of house property in London, and
  after dinner marched Henry off to the little study behind the drawing room,
  and the lawyer went meekly, carrying a large dispatch case crammed with
  papers.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to have a very pleasant evening," he said <i>soto voce</i> as
  he passed her, and she could smile sympathetically, for she knew Miss
  Revelstoke as a keen business woman with an uncanny instinct for figures.</p>

  <p>They were still busy at eleven o'clock when she knocked on the door to bid
  her employer good-night. She heard Miss Revelstoke's high-pitched voice
  declaiming bitterly about the improvidence of her tenants, and guessed that
  Henry's worst anticipations had been realized.</p>

  <p>There was much to occupy her thoughts: her strange experience had made
  this day stand out above all others, and her mind continuously roved between
  speculations on Arnold Long and the mysterious confederation whom he had
  described as the Terrible People. She heard a taxi draw up before the door,
  and Henry's voice came to her through the open window as he bade his hostess
  goodnight. Half an hour passed, and she was as wide awake as ever. The church
  clock was striking one as she fell into a troubled sleep, from which she was
  awakened by a gentle tap on the door.</p>

  <p>"Are you asleep?"</p>

  <p>It was Miss Revelstoke, and, rising and slipping on a dressing gown, the
  girl went to the door and opened it.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry if I've disturbed you. Can I come in?"</p>

  <p>Nora switched on the light and Miss Revelstoke entered. She was still
  wearing the black silk, which was the invariable material of her evening
  dress.</p>

  <p>"Henry asked me if he might pay his addresses to you," she said, so calmly
  that the girl was staggered. "His addresses&mdash;you mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He wants to marry you," said Miss Revelstoke; "and, of course, I told him
  it was nothing whatever to do with me, and that I should not influence you
  one way or the other. He is a rising man in his profession, rather well off,
  I believe, more than a bore, I'm certain, but he might make a fairly good
  husband. Good-night."</p>

  <p>She went out and closed the door behind her, leaving the girl puzzled and
  a little distressed; for this was an unforeseen complication, and its novelty
  was somewhat overbalanced by the uncomfortable knowledge that Mr. Frederick
  Henry was the last man in the world she wished to marry.</p>

  <p>When she eventually fell asleep, it was to dream of the olive-skinned Mr.
  Henry in rivalry with Betcher Long&mdash;a condition which she did not dare
  to suppose in her waking moments. Then she dreamt that she had fallen into
  the power of four terrifying men; terrifying because they were faceless and
  had neither shape nor substance. She lay bound, helpless before them, and she
  knew that they were the Terrible People, and sought vainly to pierce the veil
  that hid their identity.</p>

  <p>And somewhere in the background hovered three shapes even less tangible. A
  judge, a lawyer, and a thin-faced executioner, who had been sacrificed to the
  manes of Clay Shelton.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">THE "Terrible People" was a phrase until then, and no more.
  It stood for obscure causations that had cast not even the shadow of men. To
  no individual could the finger of suspicion be pointed. No spot on earth was
  suspect. Behind the effects that were produced were not even the nebulae of a
  mind that might be designated "cause." The police chief was patently bored
  when Betcher interviewed him that night.</p>

  <p>"Terrible People!" he snapped at last. "Betcher, I'm sick of you and your
  Terrible People! Who are they&mdash;where are they? We know nothing whatever
  about them. I wish to Heaven you'd stop putting these ideas into the
  Secretary's head. I have a confidential minute from him almost every
  day!"</p>

  <p>"I call them Terrible People, and I'm right," said Arnold confidently.
  "People&mdash;human volition&mdash;any fancy name you like to call it. Don't
  ask me who is the king pippin of the crowd&mdash;there's no crowd that I can
  see. If there was, we'd thin it down to the men I want. Shelton's gang? He
  never had a gang. He just worked solitary, so far as we know. But I won't
  swear to that. He was like a man you only see four days a year, and you've
  got to guess what he was doing in the other three-six-one. Agents? Hundreds
  of them! But they were just workmen. They did their graft and had their pay,
  an' they're trying to forget they ever helped him. They didn't kill the
  judge, the lawyer, and the executioner! They didn't try to catch me. What
  happened to Sir James and Mr. Crewe and Wallis?"</p>

  <p>"Accidents in every case," murmured the police chief wearily.</p>

  <p>"Accidents my grandmother's puddin'-faced poodle dog!" replied
  Betcher&mdash;but he said it to himself. Aloud, he asked: "Was it an accident
  they shot me up this afternoon? Was it accidental that the Lancer laid for me
  and was caught himself?"</p>

  <p>The chief sniffed.</p>

  <p>"The Lancer didn't like you: he tried to put you out, and when he found
  that he had failed, he committed suicide."</p>

  <p>Betcher's nose went perceptibly higher.</p>

  <p>Scotland Yard had never accepted the theory of the Terrible People except
  with marked scepticism. Correspondence passed to and fro, but the heads of
  the departments took the view that Betcher Long had impressed upon a romantic
  Secretary of State a story that had its proper place in a work of
  fiction.</p>

  <p>And yet</p>

  <p>Apart from death by drowning of the elder brother of Monkford, the
  following were the incidents on which Betcher had based his hypothesis. Sir
  James Cargill, the judge, who had tried and condemned Clay Shelton, had died
  suddenly a few months after the trial, but had died in perfectly natural
  circumstances. He had contracted measles whilst he was on circuit, and was
  making a fairly normal recovery, when he caught cold, pneumonia supervened,
  and he died. His nurse had made the error of leaving the lower sash of the
  bedroom window open on a raw, wet night. Some time after the death,
  Sub-Inspector Arnold Long interviewed the nurse and discovered that the woman
  had read a quasi-scientific article in her favourite periodical, in the
  course of which it had been demonstrated that there was a very grave danger
  to nurses in infectious cases unless this means of ventilation were adopted.
  It also went on to prove that such a system was best for the patient.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">Doctors are prejudiced against this method [said the
  writer], but the wise nurse is she who not only protects herself but assists
  her patient to recover.</p><br>

  <p>Betcher showed the article to a specialist, who was dumbfounded. He
  interviewed first the editor of the paper and then the writer of the article,
  a woman. She only knew that a newspaper cutting had been sent to her
  containing the gist of the article, with a blue-pencilled inscription
  suggesting that she should write an article on those lines. The reference to
  the wise nurse was heavily underlined. She thought it had come from the
  editor. This happened weeks before Sir James was taken ill. But Betcher was
  not satisfied. The nurse was the woman who had looked after the judge when he
  was down with influenza. She was likely to be called in again. And the
  article was intended for her. When he came to examine the "cutting" from
  which she was inspired, he discovered that it was a "proof" pulled on a piece
  of ordinary proof paper. He spent a fortnight discovering the cause of the
  infection&mdash;some underclothing sent from the laundry. The judge's valet
  was also infected.</p>

  <p>That was one case. The case of the Prosecuting Attorney was much more
  sensational. Purley Crewe, King's Counsel and Senior Counsel for the
  Treasury, had been the prosecutor of Shelton and had destroyed one by one the
  defences which the murderer had set up. The week Shelton was hanged, Crewe
  joined a shooting party in Norfolk. He was staying at Norwich and drove out
  to the shoot, leaving Norwich at nine o'clock. He was an expert car driver,
  given to speeding, but he knew every yard of the road, and though there was a
  heavy mist in the hollows, he kept his klaxon going and maintained a speed
  above the normal. On the highlands the visibility was good. There is a place
  called Eveleigh Hollow, where the road dips steeply and rises again at as
  acute an angle. The road is straight. From the brow of the hill he looked
  upon an impenetrable pocket of mist that hid the bottom, but he saw the road
  rising on the other side and, sounding his horn, he went down the hill at
  fifty-five miles an hour. In the hollow was a small steam roller directly
  across the road. The chauffeur broke his leg, but Crewe died that night in
  Norwich County Hospital. Here was the curious fact, that, ten minutes before,
  a farmer passed through the hollow and saw the steam roller, which had been
  used the previous day on road repair. Then it was standing in a field to the
  left of the road. It had been left on sloping ground, but there was no steam
  in it and the gears were, according to the engineer, locked. They were not
  locked when the police made an examination after the accident. It was easy to
  trace the course of the heavy roller, but though the ground was soft, no
  footprints were discoverable, except the rough imprint of the labourer's
  boots. The coroner's jury returned a verdict of accidental death.</p>

  <p>The third case was the most sensational of all from the public point of
  view. The hangman who executed Shelton was William Wallis, who was the chief
  assistant public executioner. Wallis, between hangings, followed the calling
  of a shoe repairer. He had a little basement shop outside Oldham, and was a
  man of low mentality, who sometimes drank a little more than was good for
  him, but otherwise was a very respectable citizen. Wallis was a picture fan:
  twice a week he was in the habit of visiting the local Rialto, and usually he
  went alone. He was a single man who lived with an invalid mother. He was
  returning from one of these jaunts on the Christmas Eve following the death
  of Shelton, when he fell in with a crony, Herbert Starr, a machine operative,
  who was an authority on whippet racing, a sport in which Wallis also
  indulged. They called in at a public house and had a couple of drinks before
  resuming their walk. Snow was falling heavily and they had the greater part
  of a mile to go. Early the next morning Police-Constable Bently, of the
  Lancashire Constabulary, rode along the strip of lonely road which separates
  Oldham from the village where Wallis and his friend lived. He was passing an
  allotment when he saw two snow heaps of queer shape and, dismounting, turned
  the covering over with his foot and found first Starr and then the hangman.
  They were both dead. A half-empty whisky bottle bearing the label of a
  well-known distiller lay between them, and the theory was that they had got
  drunk and had been overcome by the storm. The whisky was analyzed&mdash;it
  was just whisky. There was no trace of poisoning&mdash;in this case the jury
  found a verdict of "Death from Misadventure."</p>

  <p>Betcher was on the spot in six hours after the discovery. Three facts came
  to light. The first of these was that the whisky had not been purchased at
  the public house where the men had made their call, nor was it in their
  possession then: Wallis had asked the landlord to supply him with a bottle,
  but the host, knowing the man and seeing that he was already lit up, had
  refused. The second fact was that the cork had been removed on the place
  where the bodies were found, and neither of the men had a corkscrew. The
  third was not discovered until some time after. A jobbing shoemaker bought up
  Wallis's kit of tools, pricked his finger with an awl, and a week later
  showed symptoms of tetanus. Betcher collected the tools and sent them for
  examination. Almost every instrument was in a poisonous state.</p>

  <p>He himself had had two narrow escapes from death. Once in a dentist's
  chair, once at the hands of a racecourse gang. But who substituted for the
  cylinder of dental gas one identical in shape and description, filled with
  the deadliest vapour known to science? And how did the Terrible People know
  that the dentist would use that cylinder on his first patient that morning?
  The chemical company which prepared the gas was baffled; the dentist could
  only explain that the cylinder he intended to use had inexplicably run out,
  and he had to employ the spare supply which he kept for emergency.</p>

  <p>And when the race-boys lay in wait for him at Paddington, who told them
  that he was the man who "shopped" Tilini, their polyglot leader? They
  themselves did not know&mdash;they spoke vaguely of a message which had come
  out of jail from Tilini telling them to "get" Long. The attack ended
  abruptly, and, for one member of the gang, unpleasantly. Betcher had a
  terrible left hook and he used a knuckleduster to make sure.</p>

  <p>The country knew nothing of these happenings, seeing in the death of the
  judge no more than nature's exaction, and in the killing of the famous
  counsel one of those deplorable accidents which occur almost every day of the
  week. The death of Wallis created a mild sensation, but none saw in this an
  act of vengeance.</p>

  <p>Macfarlane pulled at his gray moustache, a moody frown on his face, as,
  for the third time in a week, Inspector Arnold Long recited the fate that had
  overtaken the three men instrumental in bringing Clay Shelton to his
  death.</p>

  <p>"I'll admit there is a possibility that you are right," he said at last,
  "and if Joshua Monkford is killed, my last doubt will go."</p>

  <p>Betcher looked at him a little resentfully.</p>

  <p>"Am I to understand, sir, that Mr. Monkford must die to bring conviction
  to Scotland Yard?"</p>

  <p>It was the sort of comment that made Betcher so very unpopular with his
  superiors.</p>

  <p>"Of course not!" snapped the Colonel. "And it is your job to see that he
  doesn't die! You have taken every precaution?"</p>

  <p>"I have two officers at Marlow, and those two private detectives engaged
  by the Bankers' Association," said Betcher, "but it isn't at Marlow that the
  danger lies."</p>

  <p>"Where, then?"</p>

  <p>"At Little Heartsease," said Long, and went on to enlighten the chief.
  "Little Heartsease is a sort of road club&mdash;in reality, a country hotel.
  It is run by a man named Cravel, and is the last word in comfort."</p>

  <p>The name was not unfamiliar to the Colonel.</p>

  <p>"Isn't there a golf tournament connected with this establishment?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>Betcher nodded.</p>

  <p>"The swellest in England," he said. "It is the Ascot of golf&mdash;an
  excuse for house parties and pretty dresses. Monkford doesn't know a tee from
  a brassie, and hundreds of other people who attend know as much; it is
  largely a social function. I shall be there, wearing my new plus fours and a
  look of resignation. For it is at Heartsease that Monkford will be in danger.
  Don't ask me why, sir, because I don't know. I've a hunch, and a hunch is
  worth a volume of exact information."</p>

  <p>Macfarlane studied his blotting pad for a while, and then:</p>

  <p>"There is one peculiar feature about Clay Shelton; I don't know whether
  it's occurred to you, Long," he said slowly.</p>

  <p>"What is that, sir?" asked Betcher, prepared to hear something
  commonplace.</p>

  <p>"He never robbed your father."</p>

  <p>Betcher stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Why, neither did he!" said he, in wonder.</p>

  <p>His father was head of one of the biggest banking corporations in the
  city, and one, moreover, run on old-fashioned lines. Getting money out of the
  Western &amp; Somerset was rather like taking money from a blind beggar.</p>

  <p>"That is certainly queer," he said.</p>

  <p>Macfarlane had performed the seemingly impossible. He had given his
  subordinate something to think about.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">BETCHER, after his interview with the chief, took a taxicab
  to Berkeley Square. He had not made half a dozen visits to his father in the
  past twelve months, and Sir Godley, whose recreation was the Italian
  Renaissance, was correcting the pages of his monograph on Savonarola when
  Arnold stalked into the little library. His father took off his glasses and
  surveyed him with an air of mild interest.</p>

  <p>"Is this a police visitation or an act of filial piety?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Neither," said Betcher gloomily, as he opened the silver box on the table
  and dubiously examined the Corona he extracted. "Is this a real cigar or is
  it one you keep for your friends?"</p>

  <p>"You're an ungrateful devil," said Sir Godley, leaning back in his chair.
  "The value of two of those cigars would represent your day's pay."</p>

  <p>"Are you a member of the Bankers' Association?" asked Betcher, as he
  pulled up a chair to the writing table.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Answer my question," said Betcher severely.</p>

  <p>"The bank, of course, is in the Association, but I have no official
  position. Weldon represents us. Anyway, I couldn't serve on a committee with
  Monkford: he is too wearing."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever heard of the Terrible People?" asked Betcher.</p>

  <p>"I've heard of many terrible people; to which particular lot do you refer?
  You don't mean the gang you wrote about?"</p>

  <p>Betcher nodded.</p>

  <p>"No, I've not heard of them. Shelton, of course, I knew by repute, but he
  never took a penny from my bank. Do you seriously think that Monkford is in
  danger?"</p>

  <p>"I seriously think he's a dead man," said Betcher, so soberly that his
  father was startled. "Will you be frank with me?"</p>

  <p>"I'll try."</p>

  <p>Betcher was silent for a moment, and then:</p>

  <p>"Why did Clay Shelton never try to catch your bank?"</p>

  <p>Sir Godley frowned.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand your slang. What do you mean by 'catch my bank'?
  Rob it?" And when Betcher nodded: "I don't know." His tone was not wholly
  convincing. "I suppose he didn't think we were big enough game for him."</p>

  <p>He turned the conversation abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Arnold," he said, "if you think there is danger from the Terrible People,
  as you call them, why on earth don't you quit? There's absolutely no reason
  why you should continue in your present profession any longer. You have had
  your amusement&mdash;I suppose it is an amusing job&mdash;and now that I can
  offer you a really good position in the bank&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He met his son's steady glance and stopped.</p>

  <p>"That is the second big offer you've made to me in the past year," said
  Betcher slowly. "When I told you that I was going after Clay Shelton, a
  little more than a year ago, you offered me ten thousand a year to take
  charge of your South American branch. You were almost as anxious that I
  should quit then as you are now&mdash;why?"</p>

  <p>Sir Godley did not meet his eyes. Instead, he laughed as though he were
  amused at something, but there was an uneasiness in his assumed
  merriment.</p>

  <p>"What a suspicious beggar you are!" he said. "Police work has completely
  spoilt your faith in humanity! Ring the bell, Arnold: I want a drink."</p>

  <p>There the conversation drifted to minor matters, and they talked no more
  about Clay Shelton or the Terrible People. It was nearly midnight when
  Betcher Long strolled out into Berkeley Square, and his father accompanied
  him to the door.</p>

  <p>His house was on the west side of the square. The traffic, taking a short
  cut through Grosvenor Square to Oxford Street, was almost continuous along
  the east side.</p>

  <p>"You had better wait till I 'phone for a taxi," said his father, surveying
  the deserted street, and Betcher laughed.</p>

  <p>"The best argument you have offered to induce me to leave the force is the
  fact that you seem to be getting nervy, my parent!" he said.</p>

  <p>He waited till the door was closed, then strolled toward Oxford Street.
  Across the central gardens he could see the lights of cars and taxis passing
  north and south, but the sidewalk along which he strolled was empty.</p>

  <p>He had gone fifty yards when he saw somebody running swiftly toward him,
  and by the light of a street lamp he saw it was a woman and wondered what was
  her hurry. And then&mdash;Plop!</p>

  <p>The bullet came unpleasantly near. Somebody was shooting through a Maxim
  silencer. He saw a man standing in the roadway. Was he shooting at the woman?
  The answer was very convincing. The bullet struck the railings not a foot
  from where he stood, and ricocheted off, humming and buzzing like an angry
  wasp. In a second he had whipped out his Browning, without which he never
  went abroad in these days, but before he could raise the gun the woman,
  gasping and breathless, had reached him and flung herself into his arms.</p>

  <p>"Save me, save me!" she gasped. "The Terrible People&mdash;the Terrible
  People!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">THE man in the roadway had disappeared as though he had been
  swallowed up in the night. Betcher dropped his gun into his coat pocket and
  lifted the half-fainting girl in his arms. He heard somebody call behind him,
  and, turning, saw his father and a footman coming toward him.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?"</p>

  <p>"A little promiscuous shooting, I think," said Betcher. "Help me get this
  girl into the house."</p>

  <p>Together they supported the swooning woman up the steps and into Sir
  Godley's study. She was rather pretty, though her features were strong and a
  little coarse, and, looking at her, Betcher Long was puzzled. He had seen her
  before somewhere, and he strove vainly to place her. Presently, she opened
  her eyes and looked wildly round, staring from Long to his father.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?" she asked. The colour had come back to her cheeks, but she
  was still shaking.</p>

  <p>And now the detective recognized her. She was the girl he had seen in the
  punt, talking to Jackson Crayley. She was in evening dress of a fashionable
  and expensive cut. There was a large diamond bar across the tightly fitting
  bodice, and her fingers blazed with gems.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what has happened," she said, a little shakily, when he
  questioned her. "Only I saw those&mdash;" She shuddered.</p>

  <p>It was not until they had forced a little wine between her chattering
  teeth that she was sufficiently recovered to tell her extraordinary story.
  She and her brother were the proprietors of a country hotel. They had a small
  flat in John Street, where they stayed when they came up to town. She had
  been to a theatre, and, the night being fine, she had decided to walk home
  alone, and had reached the end of Berkeley Square when she saw a car drawn up
  by the side of the road. As she came level, the door of the car opened and
  two men sprang out.</p>

  <p>"They had white cloths over their faces," she said, "and I was so
  terrified that I couldn't move or offer any resistance, until they tried to
  push me into the car."</p>

  <p>And then a third man had appeared from nowhere who had said: "You fools,
  that is not Nora Sanders&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nora Sanders?" said Betcher quickly. "Are you sure of the name?"</p>

  <p>The girl nodded.</p>

  <p>"The man who held me was so surprised that he released my arms and I ran.
  I heard someone say 'Get her,' and then I heard a shot, and that is all I
  remember."</p>

  <p>Save for the interruption forced by his surprise, the detective listened
  in silence to the narrative.</p>

  <p>"I have seen you before. You are Miss&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Alice Cravel," she said. "My brother and I are proprietors of Little
  Heartsease."</p>

  <p>"Little Heartsease!" Betcher Long stared at her in amazement.</p>

  <p>"You are sure they said Nora Sanders?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly sure," said the girl emphatically.</p>

  <p>"Do you know her?" And, to his surprise, she nodded.</p>

  <p>"I know her by name. She is secretary to Miss Revelstoke, who usually
  comes to Little Heartsease for the big week. In fact, she's coming next
  Monday. I don't know her well, but she was at Heartsease last year; rather a
  pretty girl."</p>

  <p>Betcher bit his lip thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"What theatre were you at to-night?" he asked, and she replied without
  hesitation, naming a well-known playhouse.</p>

  <p>Little Heartsease! Not only was Nora Sanders to be there, but John
  Monkford had booked two rooms, one of which the detective had arranged to
  occupy. It was at Little Heartsease that Monkford was to be done to death. Of
  that Arnold Long was certain. He did not believe in coincidences, and
  especially so marked a coincidence as this was.</p>

  <p>He called a taxi and saw the girl home to her flat, and then walked back
  to Scotland Yard, turning over in his mind the problem of this attempt to
  kidnap the young proprietress of the hotel in which John Monkford was to
  spend the next week. She could not very well have been mistaken for Nora, for
  she was shorter than the girl, her colouring was altogether different, and
  what should Nora Sanders be doing in Berkeley Square at midnight?</p>

  <p>Early the next morning, he left for Berkshire, and came to the road club
  at an hour when most of the guests were thinking about their morning
  bath.</p>

  <p>It was a beautiful old building standing in a great park; its
  eighteen-hole course was famous throughout the world, and the hotel had equal
  fame for its kitchen and the beauty of its appointments. Its patrons were
  wont to complain that the cost of living for a week at Little Heartsease
  would maintain a man of average income for three months in the most
  fashionable of the continental spas. It boasted a chef with an international
  reputation, a staff of the best-trained servants in the country, and it was,
  he knew, the last word in comfort and luxury.</p>

  <p>His first inquiry was for the proprietor, and he learned that Mr. Cravel
  had been out early that morning and was at that moment taking breakfast in
  his own office. A tall, rather serious-looking young man came out to greet
  Betcher Long. His morning suit was of an irreproachable cut. He had the
  indefinable air of an upper servant, which a certain type of manager never
  seems to lose.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've heard of my sister's unpleasant adventure," he said. "She was
  on the 'phone to me last night. You are Inspector Long? I think I have a room
  reserved for you next week."</p>

  <p>He was very calm, very unperturbed; not even his sister's peril ruffled
  his serene surface. Betcher Long, who was not easily surprised, was taken
  aback by the calm way in which the news of his sister's adventure had been
  accepted. But in a sentence Mr. Cravel explained his lack of distress.</p>

  <p>"My sister and I have no enemy in the world, and we have many good
  friends. It was impossible that this attempt against her could have been
  anything but a mistake. I suppose the people who held her up have not been
  arrested? No? I am not surprised. Would you like to see your room? It adjoins
  Mr. Monkford's."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to know who will be guests here next week."</p>

  <p>"I can show you a list," said the manager.</p>

  <p>He picked up a folder, opened it, and took out a foolscap sheet covered
  with neat writing. The detective's eyes went down the list of coming
  guests.</p>

  <p>"Miss Revelstoke is a regular visitor, I take it?"</p>

  <p>Cravel nodded.</p>

  <p>"She is not really interested in golf, but I think she likes the society.
  The lady whose name was mentioned by the gang that attacked my sister is her
  secretary."</p>

  <p>Betcher said nothing, but went farther down the list.</p>

  <p>"Jackson Crayley&mdash;is he a regular visitor for the golf week?"</p>

  <p>"He was here last year," said the proprietor. "Mr. Crayley is rather a
  friend of ours, if one may presume to claim friendship with guests. Or
  perhaps it would be more exact to say that he is a friend of my sister's. In
  fact"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"well, they are very good friends. My sister
  and I have visited his house at Marlow."</p>

  <p>He went on to volunteer the information that Miss Alice Cravel was in
  charge of the reception. She had a clerk and an accountant under her, and she
  was also by way of being the cashier of the establishment.</p>

  <p>The detective went up to inspect his room. It was part of a suite of
  three, consisting of two bedrooms and a saloon. The apartments were panelled
  halfway up the wall with dark oak, except the sitting room, which was
  half-panelled in some white wood. There was, he noticed, a telephone in each
  room connected with a wall plug, and each of the bedrooms had its own private
  bath.</p>

  <p>"This will be Mr. Monkford's room," said Cravel, opening the door and
  showing the beautiful interior. "It is rather larger than the one we have
  given you, and it has perhaps a finer view."</p>

  <p>The rooms were on the second floor, and, opening the lattice window of
  Monkford's apartment, Betcher looked out. Beneath, he saw a glass roof
  extending for about twenty yards, and the manager explained that this was the
  roof of the restaurant. From the detective's point of view the situation was
  admirable; it was almost impossible that danger could come to the banker from
  outside, for the glass made it impossible that a ladder could be erected
  against the window.</p>

  <p>There were three doors to the room, each of stout oak and each fitted with
  not only locks but bolts. One led to the small bathroom, one to the corridor,
  and the other into the private saloon. He went round the room tapping the
  panelling, and Mr. Cravel smiled.</p>

  <p>"We have no secret traps or doors&mdash;I think that is what you
  detectives look for in these old houses?" he said. "In point of fact, there
  is very little left of the old interior. I had everything taken out, and only
  the walls remain of the original building."</p>

  <p>As they were walking down the stairs together, the manager asked: "Is
  there any special reason why you should be staying with us, Mr. Long? That
  sounds impertinent, but is there any special reason?"</p>

  <p>"What reason could there be?" asked Betcher.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cravel shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, but one has heard all sorts of queer rumours about
  Monkford. Mr. Jackson Crayley, who is a neighbour of his, says he lives in
  terror of assassination. Is that true?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Jackson Crayley seems to know a great deal about his neighbour,"
  replied Betcher drily.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cravel laughed.</p>

  <p>"I often think that Mr. Crayley knows much more than people imagine," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Betcher returned to town with an uncomfortable feeling in his mind for
  which he could not account. It was not until he was going to bed that night
  that he realized the cause of his uneasiness. It was the knowledge that he
  was returning to that beautiful old house within a few days; for there, it
  seemed, lurked the very shadow of tragedy.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">MISS REVELSTOKE, who invariably unlocked the letter box and
  sorted her own correspondence, handed the registered package to the girl
  across the breakfast table.</p>

  <p>"For me?" said Nora, in surprise.</p>

  <p>"If the address means anything, it is for you," said Miss Revelstoke, who
  was inclined to be difficult in the early hours of the morning. "Is it your
  birthday?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Nora, as she cut the strings of the package and unfolded the
  paper in which it was wrapped.</p>

  <p>It was a small cardboard box which, in its turn, contained a smaller
  leather case about an inch and a quarter square.</p>

  <p>"A ring?" said Miss Revelstoke, watching with interest.</p>

  <p>Nora snapped open the lid of the case and gasped her amazement. She had
  never seen a diamond quite as big as that which was set in the gold ring.</p>

  <p>"This must be a mistake," she said, and then she saw the folded paper and
  opened it.</p>

  <p>There were four words in printed characters.</p><br>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">from an admiring friend</p><br>

  <p>Miss Revelstoke took the ring and examined it carefully. She was something
  of a connoisseur in the matter of jewellery.</p>

  <p>"A blue diamond," she said, "worth three hundred and fifty pounds, if it's
  worth a penny! Come now, Nora, who is your unknown admirer?"</p>

  <p>The girl could only shake her head helplessly.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure it isn't meant for me," she said.</p>

  <p>But there was the address staring her in the face. The package bore the
  date stamp of a West End office.</p>

  <p>"The old fool!"</p>

  <p>Miss Revelstoke was mildly amused, and there was no malice in her
  unflattering description.</p>

  <p>"Who?" asked the startled girl.</p>

  <p>"Monkford&mdash;who else? The man is as susceptible as a boy of
  twenty&mdash;he has always been like that. Why, I remember about ten years
  ago&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But surely it can't have come from Mr. Monkford!" interrupted Nora. "Why,
  I have hardly met him!"</p>

  <p>"Then it must have come from Henry," said Miss Revelstoke with decision,
  as she spread butter upon her toast. "I'll ring them up and tax them
  both."</p>

  <p>"Please don't do that," cried Nora, in a fright. "I shall feel horribly
  uncomfortable as it is. If I knew for certain that Mr. Monkford had sent it"
  She stopped.</p>

  <p>"You'd send it back? Then it isn't he but you who are the fool," said Miss
  Revelstoke calmly. "My dear, in my sixty years' experience, I have been an
  onlooker of love-making, and I've reached one conclusion about woman in
  relation to man, and it is, that she should take everything that is given to
  her and set it aside against the day when much more will be required in
  exchange.</p>

  <p>By the way, is there any possibility that your queer detective may be the
  donor of this elegant souvenir?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not, Miss Revelstoke!" Nora felt her face grow red and was the
  more embarrassed and incoherent. "Why should he? And have detectives so much
  money that they can afford to send diamonds to people they admire?"</p>

  <p>"Long has," said the woman, with truth. "You forget, my dear, that his
  father is a very rich man."</p>

  <p>The girl was silent. Not that she for a moment imagined that such a
  beautiful trinket could have come from Betcher Long. He was not the type of
  man who would indulge himself in such an act of gallantry. She looked at the
  ring again, a little bewildered, not a little worried.</p>

  <p>"What am I to do with it?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Keep it!" snapped Miss Revelstoke. "You needn't wear it. Put it aside
  until you feel less uncomfortable. That ring will take a lot of explaining
  away to your fiancé when you find one, but it is worth three hundred and
  fifty pounds, and those are three hundred and fifty good reasons why you
  should not dream of returning it, even if you knew. Happily, you do not know
  the giver."</p>

  <p>Miss Revelstoke was an uncomfortable sort of person. She had a trick of
  presenting the <i>fait accompli</i>, a habit which was sometimes a little
  staggering. Nora came back from a shopping excursion in Westbourne Grove to
  find the young lawyer in the drawing room, and Miss Revelstoke greeted her
  with a statement that turned her red and white.</p>

  <p>"It was not Henry who sent the ring," she said. "I had an unhappy feeling
  that it might have been."</p>

  <p>The direct attack destroys embarrassment, and the girl could only laugh
  helplessly.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't your birthday, was it, Nora?" asked Mr. Henry, a trifle
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>He had got into the habit of addressing her by name, and though she did
  not exactly resent this form of address, there were moments when his
  assurance irritated her. It was futile to wish that Miss Revelstoke had not
  been so communicative; that was part of the woman's character, and no secret
  was safe in her keeping if it could form a subject for her mild malice.</p>

  <p>"There is no fool like an old fool&mdash;I would stake all the money I
  have in the world on Monkford being the sender," she said.</p>

  <p>"But Mr. Monkford doesn't know me!" Nora was on the point of
  exasperation.</p>

  <p>"He is an idealist," said Miss Revelstoke, with an air of finality. "Get
  through to Heartsease and ask Cravel if he can let me have an extra room for
  Wednesday night. Henry is coming down&mdash;he will be the one man in the
  hotel who really plays golf," she said, and the girl went into the library to
  carry out her employer's instructions.</p>

  <p>When this was done, she ran up to her room, and, taking out the little
  blue-leather case, examined the ring again. She would not have been human if,
  behind all her embarrassment, she did not feel a considerable amount of
  gratification at being the owner of so beautiful a jewel. But there was
  something more than uneasiness in her attitude of mind. She wished she could
  see Betcher Long and ask his advice. Perhaps he would adopt the worldly view
  of Miss Revelstoke and advise her to take what the gods had given her, and
  set it aside for the day which would bring her into contact with the unknown
  donor.</p>

  <p>She put away the jewel and went downstairs. Henry had gone; she had seen
  him drive away in a taxi from the door whilst she was still in her room.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I've rather upset our young legal friend," said Miss
  Revelstoke grimly. "He wanted to know more about your ring than I could tell
  him. I wish I hadn't told him now."</p>

  <p>"I can heartily echo that wish," said Nora ruefully. Miss Revelstoke
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Henry is a good fellow," she said, "and you might do worse, Nora."</p>

  <p>To which Nora Sanders made no reply.</p>

  <p>Her employer was dining out that night, and for once dispensed with the
  attendance of her secretary. Ordinarily, Nora went everywhere with her, and
  it was very unusual for the elder woman to excuse her.</p>

  <p>"Go to a theatre&mdash;see something bright and cheerful, and forget all
  about your mysterious people," she said. "And especially the mysterious
  person who is sending you his family heirlooms!&mdash;Yes, the ring is an old
  one didn't you know that? The form of setting has been out of fashion for ten
  years."</p>

  <p>Nora had her dinner in the pretty dining room alone.</p>

  <p>She had finished her meal and was reading the evening newspaper when a
  maid came in.</p>

  <p>"Would you see Mr. Long?" she asked, and Nora sprang up, her colour coming
  and going.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Long?" she said awkwardly. "Yes, I'll see him in the drawing
  room."</p>

  <p>Perhaps there was another Mr. Long; it was not an uncommon name. But it
  was Betcher who stood in front of the empty fireplace, calmly regarding the
  big oil painting of a pretty girl in the costume of the 'sixties which hung
  above the mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he said, in his unconventional way. "Miss Revelstoke, I presume?
  At that period of life when the world was very rosy."</p>

  <p>Nora stared at the picture, realizing only then, for the first time, that
  the portrait she had seen every day was that of her employer as a girl.</p>

  <p>"I hope she won't mind my calling. Is she in?"</p>

  <p>The girl shook her head.</p>

  <p>"She has gone to the theatre."</p>

  <p>"I thought she might be. Her car passed me in Piccadilly," he said coolly.
  "Miss Sanders, how often do you go to the theatre?"</p>

  <p>"Not very often," she said quickly; "and of course, when Miss Revelstoke
  is out"</p>

  <p>"I'm not inviting you," said the calm man, with a twinkle in his eye. "I
  only wanted to know if you were in the habit of wandering about on foot in
  Berkeley Square? I see by your maidenly indignation that you are not."</p>

  <p>She laughed in spite of herself.</p>

  <p>"You imagine my maidenly indignation," she said. "I don't think I know
  Berkeley Square. At any rate, I've never walked there consciously."</p>

  <p>"In your sleep, perhaps?" he suggested, so gravely that she thought he was
  serious.</p>

  <p>"Why? Have I been reported to the police for somnambulism?" she
  challenged.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You're going to Heartsease next week, aren't you?" And, when she
  answered: "Are you a golfer?"</p>

  <p>"I play golf, but I should be terrified to play at Heartsease," she said.
  "No, I am going in attendance on Miss Revelstoke. Why do you ask me? And what
  is the news of the Terrible People?" she added quickly.</p>

  <p>Betcher Long sighed.</p>

  <p>"I hoped you had forgotten all about them," he said. "I'm
  loquacious&mdash;that's what's the matter with me. Why I put such thoughts
  into your"&mdash;he paused for a proper adjective, and unaccountably she felt
  herself grow hot&mdash;"your head, I can't for the life of me
  understand."</p>

  <p>He turned round and looked at the portrait of Miss Revelstoke again.</p>

  <p>"Pretty girl, rather," he said. "Wonder why she never married?"</p>

  <p>She could supply him with no reason. And yet, looking at the painting, she
  could only share his wonder. "Isn't it strange I never thought of
  her&mdash;like that?" All the time her mind was debating the question: should
  she tell him about the ring? That afternoon she would have welcomed such an
  opportunity, but now&mdash;suppose it was he who had sent it? She took her
  courage in both hands.</p>

  <p>"Do you ever send presents to people?" she asked, and his eyebrows rose in
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Me? Good Lord, no! I think it is a waste of time and money. Birthday and
  Christmas gifts, you mean? No. Usually you send people a thing they don't
  want or something they already have. Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>For some extraordinary reason she was a little piqued by his answer.</p>

  <p>"I wondered, that is all."</p>

  <p>"You wondered, that is all," he said slowly, a frown gathering on his
  forehead. "Who has been sending you presents?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody." She was being childish, she felt; there was no reason in the
  world why she shouldn't tell him about the diamond, and at the same time
  there was no reason why she should.</p>

  <p>"Let me see it."</p>

  <p>The calm insolence of the request took her breath away.</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" she said, before she realized the admission in the
  words.</p>

  <p>"Because I'm rather curious to see presents that are sent
  to"&mdash;another pause&mdash; "to girls, to my friends, I mean."</p>

  <p>"I'm not even a friend," she said with a half smile. "And really, Mr.
  Long, I can't imagine why you should be so interested."</p>

  <p>But he was.</p>

  <p>"I might say that I don't see why you should interest me," he said, "but
  repartee was never my long suit. Will you show me?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated for a second, then went up to her room. It was feeble of
  her, she told herself, to be dominated by a man who was little more than a
  stranger; and yet, for the moment, she could not resist the imponderable
  authority he wielded. She carried back the little box and sprung the lid. He
  looked at it for a little time and then took it in his hand and carried the
  ring to the window.</p>

  <p>"Who sent this?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It came by registered post this morning. Miss Revelstoke
  thought"</p>

  <p>Here she hesitated.</p>

  <p>"She thought?"</p>

  <p>"Well, she thought it might have been sent to me by somebody who liked me
  very much and didn't care to have me know."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea? Has Miss Revelstoke any idea who that 'somebody'
  was?"</p>

  <p>Again she hesitated.</p>

  <p>"She thought it was a friend of&mdash;of hers; a man I've only met once in
  my life."</p>

  <p>"Monkford?"</p>

  <p>She went red at this.</p>

  <p>"Really, I think we ought not even to speculate upon the sender," she
  said. "I'd like to know who it was, because I should send it back by the next
  post."</p>

  <p>He was examining the ring carefully, turning it overhand over between his
  fingers, looking at the interior of the gold circle as though he were
  searching for some mark which she had overlooked.</p>

  <p>"Have you tried it on your finger?"</p>

  <p>"No," she said, in surprise.</p>

  <p>He took her hand in his and slipped it over first one finger and then the
  other. "It was originally made for a larger finger, but would have been
  shortened, and it fits your engagement finger&mdash;do you notice that? Now,
  how did he know?"</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;Mr. Monkford?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, Monkford didn't send you this; at least, I don't think so."</p>

  <p>He handed the little case back to her.</p>

  <p>"Monkford's a queer beggar, and even a detective who has been watching him
  does not pretend to know the secrets of his heart. The cleverest detective in
  the world can rarely discover the woman's man! Ever stand in a window of an
  hotel or an office and watch the crowds going up and down and try to place
  the professions of the passers-by? That's easy compared with knowing what
  your most intimate friend looks like from the point of view of his wife!"</p>

  <p>He pondered the matter, his eyes fixed on the carpet, for fully a
  minute.</p>

  <p>"You're going to Heartsease, aren't you?" he asked abruptly. "Where is
  your room?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she answered, in surprise. "Miss Revelstoke usually has
  one of the best suites."</p>

  <p>"I ought to have discovered that," he said thoughtfully, "but there'll be
  plenty of time. Who is going down besides you and Miss Revelstoke?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody&mdash;oh, yes, Mr. Henry, Miss Revelstoke's lawyer, will be there
  for one day."</p>

  <p>"Anybody else you know?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Is Crayley a friend of Miss Revelstoke's?"</p>

  <p>She frowned.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course; yes, Mr. Jackson Crayley. Will he be there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he will be there&mdash;and I shall be there, too," he said simply,
  "and I wish to Heaven&mdash;No, I don't. It is going to be hard work, but I'm
  going to get a lot of excitement&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door opened at that moment, and, to Nora's amazement, Miss Revelstoke
  walked in. She smiled at the girl, and for a second her eyes rested on the
  ring that was still in Nora's hand. From the girl her dark eyes wandered to
  the detective.</p>

  <p>"And this is Mr. Long?" she said, with a quizzical smile. "Is he the
  guilty man? Has he confessed, Nora?"</p>

  <p>Nora Sanders's lips had opened to answer, when, to her astonishment,
  Betcher Long nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss Revelstoke, I've made a clean breast of it. It's been in the
  family for years&mdash;my uncle bought it in Copenhagen in 1862!"</p>

  <p>Miss Revelstoke's dark eyes did not flinch, but her sallow face had gone
  suddenly gray and old.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">FOR a moment the girl thought Miss Revelstoke would faint.
  She swayed slightly, and then, with a supreme exercise of her iron will, she
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"How very interesting!" she said.</p>

  <p>Arnold Long was looking at her curiously, eagerly, and his eyes had for
  the elder woman all the fascination of a snake. Try as she did, she could not
  look elsewhere than into those gray deeps.</p>

  <p>"How very interesting!" she said again.</p>

  <p>She spoke slowly, and he knew that she was deliberately masking the
  emotion his words had evoked.</p>

  <p>"And you sent it to Nora? Well, that was very nice of you, Mr. Long."</p>

  <p>Nora stood, paralyzed to inaction, looking from one to the other with
  startled eyes. What was the meaning of this extraordinary lie which Betcher
  Long had told? She was as certain as she was of anything that he had not sent
  her the ring&mdash;he had said as much. And yet, in the presence of her
  employer, he not only claimed to be the giver, but could invent its
  history.</p>

  <p>But the effect of the words upon Miss Revelstoke was even more staggering.
  Never be ore in her association with the woman had she seen her so
  shaken.</p>

  <p>"Won't you come to my study? There are one or two things I'd like to talk
  to you about, Mr. Long," said the woman at last.</p>

  <p>From that moment on, she did not seem to be aware of Nora's presence.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes." Betcher considered the request for a second. "I would like to
  have a talk with you, Miss Revelstoke, but before I go, I'd like to ask this
  young lady if she really objected to my sending her the ring?"</p>

  <p>It was then that Miss Revelstoke looked at the girl.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she asked, almost harshly.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I ought to accept so handsome a present," said Nora, and,
  to her astonishment, he reached out and took the ring and the case from her
  hand.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid you wouldn't," he said, and slipped the ring into his
  pocket. "Now, Miss Revelstoke."</p>

  <p>For a second she did not move, and then, with a visible effort, she
  turned, and he followed her to the little study that opened from the drawing
  room. She closed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"Won't you take a chair?" she asked steadily, and he waited till she was
  seated and then sat down on the edge of a big Morris chair.</p>

  <p>It was obvious to him that she did not know how to begin, was searching
  for an opening, and presently this was found.</p>

  <p>"Naturally, I feel responsible for Miss Sanders," she began, "and when
  people send her expensive presents, I think I am entitled, being an
  old-fashioned woman, to ask&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was at a loss to proceed, and he filled the gap for her.</p>

  <p>"To ask my intentions?" he smiled. "They are perfectly honourable. She is
  a nice girl; I like her very much. But when I sent the ring I was perhaps a
  little precipitate."</p>

  <p>Her unwavering black eyes did not leave his face.</p>

  <p>"You're a gentleman," she said, "and a college man, I believe? There is no
  reason why you should not wish to pay your addresses to Miss Sanders. Only it
  seems a little odd " Again she stopped.</p>

  <p>"That I should send her valuable presents at the present stage of our
  friendship? That does seem odd, I admit," said Betcher. "In fact, it's the
  oddest thing I've ever done in my life. My uncle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not very much interested in your family history." The colour was back
  in her face; two red spots showed on either cheek. "I am very anxious,
  however, to know just how you feel toward Miss Sanders. Do you love her?"</p>

  <p>Betcher's smile was broad.</p>

  <p>"I will be equally frank with you, Miss Revelstoke," he said. "I do not
  love your secretary, and it is very unlikely that I should fall in love with
  her. She is not my type, and nothing is farther from my thoughts than
  matrimony."</p>

  <p>"Then the gift of a ring was in the nature of a freakish impulse?" She
  shook her head slowly. "I cannot quite believe you. Indeed, I have a feeling
  that you are very fond of my little girl. Will you let me see the ring
  again?"</p>

  <p>He took it from his pocket and passed it across to her, and, without
  warning of what she was going to do, she rose, walked to a safe in the
  farther wall, opened it, and, putting in the ring, shut the door quickly and
  turned the key.</p>

  <p>"I think I had better keep this little trinket until you are better
  acquainted. Possibly Nora, who is a very young girl, will change her mind. It
  will not be necessary for me to notify you when her feelings are
  altered."</p>

  <p>She rose and offered her cool hand.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, Mr. Long, and good luck!"</p>

  <p>There was nothing but admiration in his eyes when he took the hand in
  his.</p>

  <p>"Going to Heartsease, Miss Revelstoke?" he asked, in his bantering tone "I
  shouldn't if I were you&mdash;I really shouldn't!"</p>

  <p>She had a trick of smiling with her eyes, and though her lips did not
  move, he saw the evidence of her amusement.</p>

  <p>"That is advice which I might very well pass on to you," she said.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Betcher Long got back to his office at Scotland Yard,
  the man who had spent all that morning searching the records at Somerset
  House, and had supplied him with news that had taken his breath away, was now
  to supplement his information with facts that were even more startling. He
  gave some directions that sent his assistant hurrying to catch the Northern
  mail, and, going back to his flat in St. James's Street, found his trunk
  packed and strapped to the back of his car. He telephoned to Marlow, and
  learnt from Mr. Monkford's housekeeper that the banker had already left for
  Heartsease. It was his practice to arrive two days before the opening of the
  festival, and he had gone off in his car accompanied by "the gentleman who
  had been staying at the house," whose other name was Sergeant Rouch of the
  Criminal Investigation Department.</p>

  <p>Betcher pulled on his gloves, turned up the collar of his mackintosh (it
  had been raining all afternoon), and took a last look round at his flat. And
  then he saw the letter on the table and called his servant.</p>

  <p>"How long has this been here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Just before you came, sir."</p>

  <p>"Who brought it?"</p>

  <p>But here the man could tell him nothing that was illuminating. He had
  found the envelope in the letter box and had put it on the table and
  forgotten all about it until Arnold Long drew attention to his omission.</p>

  <p>The address was pencilled in an illiterate scrawl. The gum on the envelope
  was still wet when he pulled it open, and, taking out a dirty-looking sheet
  of paper, read:</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center"><i>Don't go to Heartsease.</i></p><br>

  <p>Only those words. Betcher turned it over and over, placed it carefully in
  a drawer for future finger-print examination, and went out. The rain was
  pelting down; his chauffeur had pulled over the hood and was operating the
  screen-wiper when his employer appeared.</p>

  <p>"I shan't want you, Marchant," he said.</p>

  <p>"You won't want me, sir?" said the man, in surprise. "I thought you
  said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind that," said Betcher. "You've got a wife and family, haven't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the man.</p>

  <p>"Then stay in London: it's safer," replied the other, and sent the car
  spinning down St. James's Street into the park.</p>

  <p>It was nine in the evening when he arrived at Heartsease, and it had
  rained throughout the whole journey. He handed the car to the garage-keeper
  and strolled into the big, old-fashioned hall of the hotel. Although it was
  two days before the opening of the golf week, the lounge was well filled. He
  reported to the reception office and greeted the girl behind the polished
  counter with a friendly smile.</p>

  <p>Miss Cravel had evidently suffered no ill effects from her alarming
  experience. She was all smiles as she greeted him, and in her neat black
  dress looked prettier than she had in the more elaborate costume she wore
  when he saw her last.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Monkford is expecting you," she said. "You know the suite, Mr.
  Long?"</p>

  <p>He looked left and right, lowered his voice, and asked: "Will you tell me
  something, Miss Cravel?"</p>

  <p>For a second he saw suspicion in her eyes, and then:</p>

  <p>"Certainly, if I can."</p>

  <p>"Who is paying my bill?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Why, Mr. Monkford, of course."</p>

  <p>"Thank heavens!" said Betcher, and left her puzzled, for she had no sense
  of humour.</p>

  <p>Monkford had had dinner, which had been laid in the sitting room. He was
  in his brightest and most cheerful mood, for on the way down he had stopped
  at a curiosity shop in Guildford and discovered some authentic specimens of
  Bristol glassware: four emerald-green goblets that he had arrayed upon the
  mantelshelf.</p>

  <p>"By the way," he said, "the Black Fate is a fake. I shall have to write to
  Miss Revelstoke, but she'll be here next week."</p>

  <p>"The Black Fate?" For the moment, Betcher had forgotten the existence of
  the little negress.</p>

  <p>"A fake, sir! A German copy. I took it to Bethini's, and they detected the
  imposture immediately. I don't know whether I ought to tell Miss Revelstoke;
  I'm afraid of upsetting the dear old lady."</p>

  <p>A waiter came in at that moment to clear the table. When he had gone,
  Betcher put a question which he had intended asking before.</p>

  <p>"Is Miss Revelstoke a very rich woman?"</p>

  <p>"Ye-es," said Monkford, with all a banker's reluctance to discuss his
  client's affairs. "She's a fairly rich woman. In fact, I should say she was a
  very rich woman. She lives simply and her income is a pretty large one."</p>

  <p>"How large?" asked Betcher.</p>

  <p>But Monkford was not to be drawn.</p>

  <p>"I've carried her account for a long time, even when I was a country
  banker," he said. "At one time, it was an enormous amount. I think she was
  trustee for her brother's estate. Which reminds me that, when the account was
  transferred to London, we nearly lost it. It was offered to your father, but
  for some extraordinary reason, he wouldn't touch it. At that time she had the
  greater part of three quarters of a million pounds to her credit."</p>

  <p>This was news to Betcher Long. His father, he knew, was a very keen
  business man who would go to a great deal of trouble to secure an account of
  such dimensions.</p>

  <p>"Wasn't that rather remarkable&mdash;the refusal, I mean?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Monkford nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, extraordinary," he said. "Most bankers would jump at such an
  account; and it wasn't through any affection for me that Sir Godley turned it
  down. The Western &amp; Somerset are rather old-fashioned, but for Heaven's
  sake, don't tell your father I said so!"</p>

  <p>"I've already told him, or he has told me&mdash;I'm not certain which,"
  said the detective.</p>

  <p>The fact that only two nights before he had discussed Miss Revelstoke with
  his father, and that Sir Godley had made no reference whatever to the
  account, would in ordinary circumstances have perplexed him. But now he had
  got beyond confounding.</p>

  <p>Mr. Monkford was nervous; Long had noticed a subtle change in his
  appearance. He started at the slightest sound, and confessed that he had been
  sleeping badly.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if Miss Revelstoke is going to bring that girl of hers?" he
  asked, just before Betcher left him for the night.</p>

  <p>"You mean Miss Sanders?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Monkford nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;a charming girl," he said, speaking to himself; "a very, very
  charming girl." Then, as abruptly as he had opened, he changed the subject.
  "Crayley is coming down to-morrow," he said. "You don't like Crayley?"</p>

  <p>"It is rather difficult to like anybody who has no other mission in life
  than to look silly and grow roses," said Betcher, and the banker
  chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Old Crayley isn't a bad sort&mdash;not at all a bad sort," he said. "And
  the fellow's got pluck. Do you remember how he threw himself into the
  struggle when you were arresting Shelton?"</p>

  <p>"What was he doing at Colchester? I've often wondered," said Arnold
  Long.</p>

  <p>"He has an estate just outside the town. I've been to the place twice,"
  replied Monkford. "Crayley plays at farming in Essex."</p>

  <p>Without alarming the banker, Betcher had made a very close inspection of
  the bolts and fastenings of the door, and now, momentarily released from his
  vigil, he went into his own room and conducted as careful a search of that,
  not even neglecting the old-maidenly precaution of looking under the bed.</p>

  <p>The window looked down upon a strip of garden that ran parallel with the
  building, the end wall of the restaurant being immediately opposite the
  centre of the sitting room. Locking the door communicating with the saloon,
  he fastened the bathroom door, though here there was no necessity, for the
  little bathroom was built on the American plan, and depended for light upon
  an electric lamp in the ceiling. Putting the key into his pocket, he strolled
  downstairs. Miss Cravel had disappeared, her place having been taken by a
  girl clerk. Cravel himself was in the lounge talking to one of his guests. He
  was in evening dress, but instead of the usual dinner jacket he wore a long
  black frock coat. Presently, catching the manager's eye, the detective drew
  him aside.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see some of your more expensive suites," he said.</p>

  <p>Cravel shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid they're all booked " he began.</p>

  <p>"I'm not thinking of taking them," interrupted Betcher, "but I'd like to
  know just what sort of accommodation I should get another year."</p>

  <p>"Come upstairs." Cravel took a key from the reception clerk and led the
  way to the first floor. "This is Miss Revelstoke's suite," he said, "and is
  one of the best in the house."</p>

  <p>Little Heartsease had once been a country mansion that in itself was the
  relic of a more pretentious castellated building, and Miss Revelstoke's
  principal room was almost like an apartment of state, with its turret
  alcoves.</p>

  <p>He followed the manager into the room and strolled from one bedroom to the
  other.</p>

  <p>"I suppose this will be for Miss Sanders?" He indicated the smaller of the
  two beautiful rooms.</p>

  <p>The manager was watching him with mild amusement. When he came back: "I
  really believe, Mr. Long, that it wasn't idle curiosity that made you ask me
  to show you this suite. You're here on duty!"</p>

  <p>"I'm always on duty," evaded Betcher.</p>

  <p>"Honestly, Mr. Long, do you expect any kind of a rumpus here? I wouldn't
  have it for the world! Especially next week, when the place will be packed
  out. Heartsease wouldn't survive a scandal."</p>

  <p>Betcher looked at him and winked.</p>

  <p>"It has survived many," he said, "unless my memory is at fault."</p>

  <p>"I don't mean those kinds of scandal," said the manager hastily.
  "Naturally, that sort of thing happens, and you can't prevent it; and nobody
  thinks any the worse of us. But if somebody was shot up&mdash;well, it would
  ruin the place, that's all."</p>

  <p>"It might also ruin the person who was shot up," said Betcher, showing his
  teeth in a mirthless smile. "You need have no fear, Mr. Cravel. We shall do
  our very best to avoid anything that looks like a tragedy."</p>

  <p>The next day was Sunday, and, strolling through the lounge in the evening,
  he saw a familiar face and crossed the room to shake the limp hand of Jackson
  Crayley. "Perfectly horrible weather," grumbled the languid man, pulling
  dismally at his yellow moustache. "If I'd had any sense I'd have gone to
  Deauville. Golf is a beastly game, anyway."</p>

  <p>Betcher saw him smile and nod at somebody behind the detective's back,
  and, turning, he had a glimpse of Miss Alice Cravel passing through the hall
  to her office.</p>

  <p>"Deuced nice girl that. Quite a lady and all that sort of thing," said Mr.
  Crayley. "To tell you the truth," he said, in a burst of confidence, "I
  wouldn't come to this wretched place at all if it wasn't for that dear little
  girl."</p>

  <p>"A friend of yours?"</p>

  <p>"Ya-as." Mr. Crayley took out his monocle, wiped it, and replaced it in
  his eye. "Yes, and I'm not ashamed of it. She's one of the dearest little
  ladies I have ever met."</p>

  <p>"And yet," said Betcher, very deliberately, "when I saw you speaking to
  her at Marlow, you told me she was a visitor who wanted to see over your
  garden, and that you were rather annoyed at her impertinence."</p>

  <p>"Did I?" said Mr. Crayley, unabashed. "Well, the truth is, old man, I'm
  not the sort of bird who wears his heart on his sleeve. I don't mind telling
  you in absolute confidence that I'm particularly attached to that dear little
  girl. Naturally, a fellow has to be careful&mdash;what? How are Scotland Yard
  and all kind friends?"</p>

  <p>"They're bearing up bravely in my absence," said Betcher. "Have you seen
  Mr. Monkford?"</p>

  <p>"He's here, is he? Why, of course, I ought to go up and pay my respects to
  the old boy. Very useful having a banker for a friend&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>He dug his finger facetiously in Betcher's ribs, but his gesture was
  almost as feeble as his jocularity.</p>

  <p>"I have a strange room this year," he complained. "That wretched woman
  Revelstoke has bagged the suite I usually have, and I'm fearfully annoyed
  about it."</p>

  <p>"Don't you like Miss Revelstoke?"</p>

  <p>"Hate her!" said Mr. Crayley, with unexpected vehemence. "She's most
  unkind. She can't say a decent word to a fellow&mdash;always snapping and
  snarling at him. I loathe her!"</p>

  <p>There was truth in this, if the concentrated venom of his tone meant
  anything.</p>

  <p>"I'll totter up and see dear old Thingummy-tight."</p>

  <p>It was his eccentricity that he remembered names with difficulty, but
  Betcher guessed he meant Monkford. He saw the weary Jackson Crayley later in
  the evening; he was leaning over the counter talking to Miss Cravel, who
  usually at this hour had been relieved by the girl clerk; and he wondered
  what community of interest there was between this rather flashy type of lady
  and the exquisite man of fashion whose life seemed to be one blank
  boredom.</p>

  <p>That Sunday was the longest day that Betcher Long ever remembered
  spending. He went out with Monkford and played an execrable game of golf in
  the morning and the afternoon was a weariness and a trial. And then he began
  to understand just what it was that was lengthening this day so inordinately.
  It was the knowledge that the morrow would bring Nora Sanders to Heartsease,
  and that the big period of peril would begin.</p>

  <p>The storm had cleared; the sun was shining in a blue sky when Miss
  Revelstoke's fast limousine flashed up the drive and came to a noiseless halt
  before the portal of Heartsease. Mr. Cravel was in attendance to welcome his
  guests, and the presence of Inspector Long seemed a little superfluous. So
  Miss Revelstoke seemed to think, for she passed him with a curt nod, her
  attention seemingly concentrated upon the obsequious manager.</p>

  <p>"You have a few parcels: let me help you."</p>

  <p>Nora had seen him the moment the portico of the hotel had come into view,
  and laughingly she waved aside his assistance, which was unnecessary, since a
  small army of porters was in waiting to deal with the baggage which was piled
  on the top of the car.</p>

  <p>"Welcome to Heartsease!" said Betcher solemnly. "I'm a deputation from the
  Town Council to offer you the freedom of our ancient borough."</p>

  <p>"You don't even know the name of the borough," she laughed.</p>

  <p>"Betcher!" said Mr. Long promptly, and apologized incoherently.</p>

  <p>She went quickly in the wake of Miss Revelstoke, and he did not see her
  again until after dinner that night, and then only for a few minutes. Tuesday
  came, and the beginning of the great tournament. Heartsease was crowded out,
  the broad lawn had disappeared under gaily hued umbrellas and tea tables, and
  the hall was rather like the entrance gate at a popular football match.</p>

  <p>To keep track of newcomers would in ordinary circumstances have been
  impossible; but the Heartsease golf course lay within a ring fence: there
  were two entrances to the park, and at each of these two detectives kept a
  look-out for suspicious characters. Beyond a fashionably dressed pickpocket
  or two, and a confidence man from London who thought the occasion might yield
  profit to himself, there were no ignominious rejections, nor did Betcher Long
  anticipate there would be.</p>

  <p>Wednesday brought Mr. Henry, the lawyer, and, seeing him dismount from his
  car, Betcher groaned.</p>

  <p>"Here's a bird who has come golfing in a top hat," he said over his
  shoulder (he viewed the arrival from Mr. Monkford's sitting-room window).</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" asked the banker.</p>

  <p>"Henry, the lawyer. Do you know him?"</p>

  <p>"Know him!" scoffed Monkford. "Why, I should say so! He's Miss
  Revelstoke's lawyer and a rising man."</p>

  <p>"Rising! He'll be coming up for the third time if he goes golfing in a
  stovepipe hat," said Betcher.</p>

  <p>It was not surprising that Mr. Monkford should have many friends. He was a
  popular figure in the City of London, and as a connoisseur, he had been
  brought into touch with a certain artistic and literary set. Visitors flowed
  into his room all day long, for beyond the hour's walk he had in the morning,
  in company with Betcher, he seldom left the hotel, for professional golf was
  anathema to him. So that he did not join the crowds of enthusiasts that
  hampered the putting of the only great golfer England has ever produced.</p>

  <p>Except on the night of his arrival, he had his meals in the great dining
  room, and found his chief pleasure in these functions, and in the crowd that
  thronged the lounge after dinner. And as day followed day, and no sign of
  danger appeared, he forgot his fears and was his old cheerful self. On the
  Tuesday he was elected President of the Dance Committee, and threw himself
  into the work of organizing the fancy-dress ball which was to conclude the
  week's festivities.</p>

  <p>That evening, looking from his window, Betcher saw the banker walking up
  and down the side lawn immediately beneath the detective, and he was in
  earnest conversation with Henry and Crayley. For half an hour they paced to
  and fro, and obviously the subject of their talk was a serious one. Once,
  Monkford looked up and saw him, but did not wave the friendly greeting which
  Betcher anticipated.</p>

  <p>They must have gone into the hotel soon after, for five minutes later he
  heard the three men talking in the saloon, which was next to his own room.
  They were together for about a quarter of an hour, at the end of which time
  the detective heard the outer door close and went in. The banker was alone,
  and obviously something had happened which had upset him.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong?" asked Long.</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing!" Mr. Monkford almost snapped the words. And
  then:</p>

  <p>"I want to see you after dinner, Long."</p>

  <p>"Why not see me now?"</p>

  <p>"It can wait," said the banker.</p>

  <p>"Does it concern you?"</p>

  <p>"In a sense, yes," said the other shortly. "But it concerns a&mdash;a
  young friend of mine more. But, really, I do not wish to speak about the
  matter at the moment. If you will see me immediately after dinner, we can
  discuss something which has rather distressed me. Yes, it has distressed
  me."</p>

  <p>No more would he say, and Betcher went out of the room more than a little
  puzzled.</p>

  <p>He buttonholed Crayley in the hall.</p>

  <p>"What have you been telling Monkford to make him so infernally depressed?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>Jackson Crayley looked at him open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"We were talking about a purely personal and private matter. If he didn't
  tell you, I'm afraid I can't. I'm on my honour."</p>

  <p>Betcher looked at him closely. There was something about him that was
  unusual and difficult to define. His voice was a little sharper; he gave the
  impression that he was labouring under some extraordinary strain&mdash;there
  was an unusual tenseness even in his attitude. Betcher was puzzled. He did
  not know Henry&mdash;at any rate, well enough to discover from the lawyer
  what had been the subject of that lawn conference&mdash;and it was the more
  baffling because, all that day, Joshua Monkford had been in his gayest mood,
  and had even suggested a visit to the links to follow two popular
  players.</p>

  <p>As a rule, he dined with Monkford, but, just as he was dressing for
  dinner, the banker's valet came with a note.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Do you mind dining at another table to-night? I have one or
  two things that I wish to discuss with Crayley and young Henry.</p><br>

  <p>He was not so much annoyed as worried. What could be Monkford's new
  preoccupation? He searched round in his mind, trying to find a clue, but he
  could remember nothing that the banker had said which would explain this
  sudden business of his.</p>

  <p>He saw him at dinner that night, but, more to the point, was placed at a
  table next to that occupied by Miss Revelstoke and her secretary. For one
  fleeting second the girl's eyes met his, and he remembered, with a start of
  guilt, that he had yet to explain to her (and probably would never be in a
  position to explain) the lies he had told about the ring.</p>

  <p>Miss Revelstoke's little bow was graciousness itself. There was in her
  eyes a look of malicious triumph which made Betcher Long grin inwardly.
  Dinner was over and he was taking his coffee in the lounge when Joshua
  Monkford pushed through the press toward him.</p>

  <p>"Come upstairs to my room in five minutes, Long, will you, please?"</p>

  <p>There was a cold menace in the tone which left Long speechless. He watched
  the clock till five minutes had passed; then, rising, he made his way to the
  elevator.</p>

  <p>The saloon was empty when he strolled in, but he heard Monkford's voice
  speaking from his own room, and he was evidently at the telephone.</p>

  <p>"Hullo&mdash;hullo!... Who has</p>

  <p>Then Betcher heard an explosion and the sound of a body falling, and
  strove to force the door. It was locked and bolted on the inside, as he
  remembered now, and, flying through the saloon into the corridor, he tried
  the outer door. That also was locked.</p>

  <p>He threw himself against the door but it was of stout oak and resisted his
  efforts. And then, looking round, he saw Cravel running up the stairs, and on
  the man's white face was an expression of consternation.</p>

  <p>"Was that a shot?" he asked in a horrified whisper. Betcher nodded.</p>

  <p>"Open this door," he said.</p>

  <p>The manager felt in his pockets.</p>

  <p>"I haven't a pass-key&mdash;wait," he said, and ran down the stairs.</p>

  <p>He was back in a minute and, inserting the pass-key with a trembling hand,
  the lock snapped and the door flew open.</p>

  <p>Joshua Monkford lay huddled on the floor, face downward, his hands
  gripping the receiver of the telephone, and in the room was the acrid smell
  of cordite.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p class="first">HE WAS dead. One glance told the detective that. "Get a
  doctor," he said over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Is he killed?" whispered the manager.</p>

  <p>"Get a doctor!" snarled Long. "Do as I tell you."</p>

  <p>Left alone, Arnold Long closed the door. There was no key in the lock
  except the manager's pass-key, which still protruded on the outside. He
  crossed the floor to the bathroom; it was bolted and locked, as also was the
  door to the saloon, as he knew. The windows were dosed, for the night was
  chilly, and, moreover, fastened with a latch. Above the three windows were
  little fanlights, and these alone were opened. He flung back the window and
  looked down. The glass roof of the restaurant annex glowed with light; sign
  of ladder there was none.</p>

  <p>A long wardrobe near the end of the bed was empty, and the bed itself
  concealed nothing. Taking up a hairbrush from the dressing table, he tapped
  the panelled walls on the side of the room opposite to that which divided the
  apartment from the saloon. And as he sounded the wall he knew that his work
  was futile. The weapon that killed Joshua Monkford had been held within an
  inch of the man's head, and from the position where he lay, it was clear
  that, even if there were a secret panel, it must open into the saloon where
  he himself had been a second before the shot was fired.</p>

  <p>Making a rough measurement with Monkford's umbrella, which happened to be
  in the room, he was satisfied that, even were there an opening into the
  saloon, it was impossible that the murderer could have shot at so close a
  range.</p>

  <p>The opposite wall marked the boundary between the Monkford suite and a
  room occupied by two girls, the daughters of a Member of Parliament who were
  staying at Heartsease for the week.</p>

  <p>Betcher Long breathed heavily. Here was a man done to death in a room that
  could not be entered&mdash;that was, in fact, impossible to enter except by
  the door through which the manager's key had admitted him.</p>

  <p>As he walked out into the corridor, Cravel nearly ran into him. His face
  wore an expression of fear, and he was talking excitedly to the servant girl
  who accompanied him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Long," he said urgently, "something has happened in Miss Sanders's
  room."</p>

  <p>Betcher glared at him.</p>

  <p>"Happened? What has happened?" he almost shouted.</p>

  <p>Behind the manager was a quavering servant maid. "I don't know, sir; I
  heard something explode&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Before she could finish the sentence he was halfway down the stairs. The
  girl's room he knew. It was locked, and, looking through the keyhole, he saw
  a thin film of smoke suspended in the atmosphere, and his heart turned faint.
  And then: "Whatever do you want, Mr. Long?"</p>

  <p>He leapt round. It was Nora Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Have you got the key?" He could hardly recognize the sound of his own
  voice.</p>

  <p>He almost snatched the key from her hand, and, flinging open the door,
  strode in. There had been some sort of an explosion here: he could smell it.
  And then he saw a white, smouldering paper on the hearthstone, and picked it
  up, dipping it without ceremony in a jug of water which stood on the
  washstand.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" asked the bewildered girl.</p>

  <p>"Nothing very much. Will you stay here?"</p>

  <p>In a second he was out of the room and going up the stairs two at a time.
  He had left the manager in Monkford's room, and now he found him outside in
  the passage, the door closed.</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd better lock it while you were away."</p>

  <p>Betcher nodded his thanks, and together they entered the room. In the
  relaxation of death the telephone receiver had fallen to the floor and lay
  stained with the blood of the man. Monkford had been shot through the head at
  close quarters, almost as Harry the Lancer had been shot, and as the
  unfortunate ex-soldier at Bourne End had been shot.</p>

  <p>Betcher looked round. By this time one of the detectives on duty in the
  hotel had either sensed or heard of the occurrence and had arrived. They
  turned the manager out of the room, locked the door, and began a careful
  examination.</p>

  <p>The room had been empty when Betcher had opened the door: of that he was
  certain. There was no place where a man could be concealed. Then, inch by
  inch, he began another examination of the wall, tapping each panel, whilst
  his assistant tested the other. The ceiling was of plaster. There was no
  fireplace except a vent to carry off the hot air generated by an electric
  stove. He picked up the telephone, wiped it clean on a towel, and called up
  the office. It was Miss Cravel who answered him, and evidently from her tone
  she knew that something terrible had happened.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Mr. Long?" she asked. "Is it true&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was speaking in a low voice, evidently from that part of the building
  which was more or less public.</p>

  <p>"Who called Mr. Monkford five minutes ago?" asked Betcher.</p>

  <p>"Nobody&mdash;he called here. I had his signal and answered it, and then I
  thought I heard a shot."</p>

  <p>He put down the instrument as somebody tapped on the door. It was a
  doctor, one of the guests, who had been hastily summoned. He looked at the
  still figure and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You don't want me to tell you he's dead, do you?" he asked, as he stooped
  and made a cursory examination. "Shot through the brain. I should say death
  was instantaneous. And at close quarters, too&mdash;you see the burning?"</p>

  <p>Betcher nodded. The wound had been inflicted by something that had the
  appearance of a bullet from an automatic pistol.</p>

  <p>"Have you got your man?"</p>

  <p>Evidently the doctor had been told of Arnold Long's identity.</p>

  <p>"No, we have no man, because there was no man here when we came into the
  room. It was empty."</p>

  <p>"Suicide?" asked the doctor, in surprise.</p>

  <p>That possibility had been the first to occur to the detective. But there
  was no sign of any weapon. Mr. Monkford had carried a Browning pistol for
  protection, but this the detective had found in a drawer of his bureau, and
  it was clean, and, what was more, unloaded. How had the murder been
  committed? For murder it was, undoubtedly.</p>

  <p>He finished his inspection and went in search of Crayley. He had no need
  to be a psychologist to realize that the story of the tragedy had already
  reached Monkford's neighbour.</p>

  <p>"This is terrible, terrible! Why should he shoot himself? He was in the
  most cheerful mood this afternoon when I spoke to him"</p>

  <p>"Now, listen, Crayley. I'm going to ask you a few questions. That young
  lawyer and you were with Monkford this afternoon. You told him something that
  depressed him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He told me something that depressed me!" said Crayley loudly. "And don't
  bully me, Long, because I'll not stand for it! I'm all rattled and upset by
  this poor chap's death, and my nerves can't endure any bullying. I tell you,
  I won't even discuss the subject of our conversation."</p>

  <p>"Maybe you'll discuss it with the coroner to-morrow," said Betcher, and
  the man's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"Threatening me, are you, by gad! Threatening me! And I saved your
  infernal life at Chelmsford!"</p>

  <p>"Now, see here, Crayley, let's get this matter right. I'm not threatening
  you; I am asking you questions that any police officer would ask any honest
  man. And, what is more, any honest man would answer. What was the subject of
  your conversation with 'Monkford this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>Crayley shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I am not at liberty to say. You had better ask Henry: it concerned him
  more than me. And I feel, Long, that I ought to see my lawyers before I make
  any statement after this terrible tragedy."</p>

  <p>Betcher Long went in search of the lawyer, only to learn that Mr. Henry
  had left the hotel immediately after dinner and was well on his way to
  London.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">MISS REVELSTOKE brought the news to Nora, and the girl was
  speechless with horror. "Dead?" she whispered. "Oh, no, Miss Revelstoke, that
  can't possibly be! Did he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. The doctor seems to think it's a case of suicide," she
  said. "But why poor Monkford should commit suicide I can't imagine."</p>

  <p>She was visibly agitated. Usually a very phlegmatic person, she paced the
  room restlessly.</p>

  <p>"He has been threatened with death for a long time. Crayley told me, but
  of course I didn't believe him. That is why the detective is here&mdash;your
  Mr. Long. A pretty detective!"</p>

  <p>"I thought you said it was suicide, Miss Revelstoke."</p>

  <p>"It was not suicide. Simpkins says no weapon has been found. He is a
  foolish kind of man, even for a doctor."</p>

  <p>"But who could have killed him?"</p>

  <p>"Don't ask fool questions, child," said the yellow-faced woman savagely.
  "He's dead, that's sufficient! I can only hope that his bank is not insolvent
  or something equally dreadful. As to Mr. Long&mdash;well, he doesn't enjoy
  any too enviable reputation at Scotland Yard, according to Henry, and this
  ought to be his finish."</p>

  <p>There was a note of cold malignity in her voice that made the girl sit
  bolt upright and stare at her.</p>

  <p>"Don't you&mdash;don't you like Mr. Long?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>It seemed incredible that there was anybody in the world to whom Betcher
  Long was not an attractive personality.</p>

  <p>"He'll blame the Terrible People, of course. The Terrible People are
  probably an invention of his to account for his failures. Like him? <i>Herr
  Gott!"</i></p>

  <p>She said something in German, and checked herself.</p>

  <p>"Nora," she said, "every woman has got something in her past which she
  does not wish should be raked into public view. By some extraordinary
  accident your Mr. Long has unearthed an old folly of mine that I thought was
  dead and buried. I won't tell you what it was. You would probably be bored
  and think I was mad. It happened in Copenhagen when I was a very young
  girl&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"Let it go at that. No, I do not like your Mr. Betcher Long!"</p>

  <p>The girl was silent. In the circumstances, it would be worse than
  foolishness to attempt to defend a man who she felt had done his duty. She
  could not imagine Arnold Long failing in his trust.</p>

  <p>"What is this story of an explosion in your room, Nora?" she asked
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>The girl could only tell her what had happened.</p>

  <p>"I knew nothing until I saw Mr. Long trying my door. One of the maids told
  me she had heard three or four shots fired, and there was something burning
  on the hearth when Mr. Long and I went in: a thick strip of white paper."</p>

  <p>"What happened to that?" asked Miss Revelstoke curiously, and Nora told
  her.</p>

  <p>Evidently it did not seem a very alarming happening to the elder woman,
  for she made no further reference to it. She went down to join the guests,
  leaving the girl to pack&mdash;hearing of the tragedy, she had announced her
  intention of returning to London in the morning. Nora was so engaged when
  there was a knock at the saloon door. It was Mr. Cravel, and he was a very
  self-possessed man.</p>

  <p>"Everybody is leaving," he said. "The news got out through the doctor.
  This is ruin for me!"</p>

  <p>Yet his voice was very calm and his attitude was that of a man who was
  viewing another's misfortune.</p>

  <p>"I suppose the thing will blow over between now and next year, and anyway,
  I intended to make big alterations here. We shall cut out the room where this
  wretched suicide happened&mdash;I can bring the staircase through it without
  any great difficulty."</p>

  <p>His whole interest in the tragedy was the effect it had upon his own
  fortunes. It was natural, perhaps, thought the girl, and yet there was a
  certain cold-bloodedness in his disregard of the horror which had swept
  Joshua Monkford into eternity that was almost repulsive to the girl.</p>

  <p>When Miss Revelstoke returned, Nora spoke of the manager's seeming
  callousness.</p>

  <p>"My dear, you don't expect him to weep over poor Monkford, do you?" asked
  the elder woman testily. "He is probably ruined&mdash;certainly so far as
  this season is concerned. Only the lunatic golfers are staying; the rest of
  the guests are leaving in the morning; some have already left. The week is
  spoilt from Cravel's point of view, and I think it is rather wonderful that
  he can keep his head as he is doing. I saw your detective downstairs. He
  asked me if he might come up and speak to you&mdash;you don't mind?"</p>

  <p>Nora shook her head.</p>

  <p>"What information he expects to get from you, I can't imagine," said Miss
  Revelstoke. "You won't object to being left alone with him? The very sight of
  the man irritates me."</p>

  <p>It was soon after this that Arnold Long made his appearance. He was
  looking dreadfully tired, the girl thought; the strain was telling on him,
  and her heart went out to him in sympathy.</p>

  <p>Contrary to Nora's expectations, Miss Revelstoke did not mark her
  disapproval by leaving them together.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, she made no sign of departing.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Long, have you made any discovery?"</p>

  <p>"None," he said curtly, "except, of course, that Monkford was
  murdered."</p>

  <p>"But how? The manager tells me the room was empty when you went in, and
  that the only man near poor Monkford when he was shot&mdash;was you!"</p>

  <p>Betcher looked at her quickly.</p>

  <p>"Was me? That view certainly hadn't struck me," he said ironically.</p>

  <p>"I daresay it will occur to others," said Miss Revelstoke. "Mr. Cravel
  tells me that he was on the second floor, heard a shot, and ran upstairs, and
  found you standing at the door, apparently trying to open Mr. Monkford's
  door. Why should it be locked?"</p>

  <p>"I have wondered that, but it was locked." The yellow-faced woman shrugged
  her shoulders, and her lips twitched with amusement.</p>

  <p>"Apparently, there is no key, and Mr. Cravel said the door could not have
  been locked on the inside; otherwise, he could not have opened it with his
  pass-key. But perhaps you have found the key of the door?"</p>

  <p>"There is that possibility," replied the detective coolly. "It was, in
  fact, in poor Monkford's pocket." Miss Revelstoke's eyebrows arched
  inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Cravel said that the key was still hanging in the reception office, and
  is there still. As you found the key in Monkford's pocket, it must have been
  one quite unknown to the hotel."</p>

  <p>She saw Betcher Long start, and a smile dawn on his tired face.</p>

  <p>"That's it!"</p>

  <p>Of a sudden his face had changed; the tiredness had vanished, and a new
  light had come to his eyes.</p>

  <p>"That's it, of course! What a fool I was! What an utterly stupid
  fool!"</p>

  <p>The effect of his sudden enthusiasm on Miss Revelstoke did not pass
  unobserved. Nora saw the woman's face lengthen, her lips parted as though she
  were going to say something, but no sound came; and then the arched brows
  came down to a deep frown.</p>

  <p>"That is it?" she repeated. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Revelstoke"&mdash;he was almost jovial&mdash;"you have supplied me
  with the obvious solution to this terribly queer mystery. And now I will
  unburden my soul. I lied to you just now when I told you I had found the key
  in his pocket. As a matter of fact, I didn't find the key in his pocket, and
  I've been searching the room for it since the crime was committed. But I lie
  naturally, and a lie's the most exciting and provocative statement I know,
  especially to those&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He did not conclude the sentence, and Miss Revelstoke waited, but waited
  in vain. He turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"I was going to ask you a whole lot of questions about the explosion in
  your room," he said, "but that is not necessary. I know every fact now,
  except one: how did the man who killed Joshua Monkford escape from the
  room?"</p>

  <p>Miss Revelstoke's lips curled.</p>

  <p>"That seems to be rather more important than any other question," she
  said, with her arid smile.</p>

  <p>"It is and it isn't," said Betcher Long, speaking half to himself. "The
  really important question that I have not yet answered is: why did Mr. Henry,
  that eminent lawyer, call at Staines police station at a quarter to nine and
  report to the inspector in charge the loss of a wristwatch which he had left
  behind in his room?"</p>

  <p>The woman's eyes were wide open now, and the smile had left her face.</p>

  <p>"You're almost as mysterious as the mysterious people, Mr. Long," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"Mysteriouser," said Betcher Long. "For at the very minute Henry called at
  the police station, Monkford was shot dead. I have never heard of a better
  alibi!"</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <p class="first">MISS REVELSTOKE had not exaggerated when she had said that
  more than half the guests were leaving. Arnold Long, who had made a flying
  visit to town, returned to find no more than half a dozen people in the big
  luncheon room, and the settled air of melancholy upon the faces of the
  waiters was convincing proof that the season was spoiled.</p>

  <p>At Cravel's earnest request, three joiners had been engaged since the
  early morning in removing the panelling from the room where the crime had
  been committed, and this had been carried out under the supervision of
  Detective-Sergeant Rouch.</p>

  <p>Betcher went up to inspect the devastation. The walls had been stripped to
  the brickwork; a section of the floor had been taken up, and the detective
  needed to be no architect to understand that it was impossible for any person
  to have entered or left the room.</p>

  <p>Sergeant Rouch was a fair, stout man of middle age, whose principal
  characteristic was his optimism, and his admirable faith that the most
  complicated problem would solve itself. This had been the guiding principle
  of his life, as he explained to Betcher in a moment of confidence.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter how clever these fellows are, they're bound to hang
  themselves in the long run," he said cheerfully. "My own idea is that poor
  old Monkford was shot by a marksman from Grundley Hill&mdash;it's only five
  hundred yards away&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The windows were closed, and the bullet that killed Monkford was fired
  from less than six inches' distance," said Betcher curtly.</p>

  <p>He took out of his pocket a little package and unfolded it, revealing the
  soiled end of the burnt and sodden paper he had taken from the hearth in
  Nora's room.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" asked Rouch curiously.</p>

  <p>"It is all that remains of a cracker. You can buy them at a shilling a
  packet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Fireworks?" asked Rouch, in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Fireworks," agreed Mr. Long gravely. "The delight of your childhood,
  Rouch&mdash; if you ever had a childhood."</p>

  <p>"Certainly I did," said Rouch indignantly. "Why, when I was
  four&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't let us go into your horrible past," interrupted Betcher. "This was
  thrown through the window of Miss Sanders's room, or introduced in some other
  way, the object being at a crucial moment to attract me from Monkford's room,
  and, like a fool, I was attracted! Whilst I was away, something
  happened&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The murderer escaped," said Rouch comfortably. "I've seen that done
  before. When I was on the Gonleston bank case&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The murderer couldn't have escaped, because the murderer wasn't there,"
  Betcher Long went on, displaying admirable patience with these
  interruptions.</p>

  <p>"Then how was he killed?" asked Mr. Rouch triumphantly.</p>

  <p>Betcher regarded him more in sorrow than in anger. "Rouch, you have
  everything in the world that man can desire, except brains!" he said.</p>

  <p>"Well, how was he killed?" persisted Rouch. "It is all very well to say
  that I haven't brains, Mr. Long, but here is a man killed in a locked room,
  the only human being near being you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You've got that theory, too, have you?" Betcher grinned. "Sit ye down,
  Rouch. I'm going to put you through the third degree. Where did you get that
  'you were the only man' stuff?"</p>

  <p>"Well"&mdash;Sergeant Rouch was a little uncomfortable, wiped his
  profusely perspiring brow with a rapid sweep of his handkerchief, and
  shrugged his plump shoulders&mdash;"I'm only saying&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Where did you get your say? You could never have acquired that
  illuminating theory out of your own nut. Who has been talking to you?"</p>

  <p>"It is what Cravel thinks, anyway," said the disgruntled detective. "He
  said it was very curious that you were the only person near at hand when the
  shot was fired."</p>

  <p>"Bring Cravel here: I want a little talk with him."</p>

  <p>Mr. Cravel came. It seemed that by now he was resigned to the inevitable
  monetary loss that the tragedy brought to him. He could even smile as he
  glanced round the dismantled room.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Long, have you found any secret traps or secret panels?"</p>

  <p>Betcher did not reply.</p>

  <p>"Shut the door," he said to his subordinate, and, when this was done:</p>

  <p>"You remember, Cravel, that when you came upstairs after you heard the
  shot, I was standing at the door, trying to open it?"</p>

  <p>For a second the ghost of apprehension appeared in the manager's eyes.</p>

  <p>"You're not going to take seriously anything I've said to Rouch, are you?
  I merely remarked that you were the nearest living person, so far as we know,
  to Mr. Monkford when he was murdered. That is so obvious a fact that you
  won't think I suggested&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not worrying about what you suggest," interrupted Betcher. "I'm
  merely going to ask you a few questions. You remember my turning to you and
  asking if you had a key to the door?"</p>

  <p>Cravel nodded; he was watchful, alert, all his senses tense.</p>

  <p>"And you also remember that you went downstairs and returned with a pass-
  key?"</p>

  <p>"I did, yes."</p>

  <p>"From whom did you get it?" asked Betcher.</p>

  <p>"From the floor waiter."</p>

  <p>"Find him," said Betcher curtly, addressing Rouch. He did not speak till
  the waiter was brought into the room.</p>

  <p>"Have you a pass-key for this floor?"</p>

  <p>Only for the fraction of a second did the man glance at his employer, and
  then: "Yes."</p>

  <p>"Let me see it."</p>

  <p>Reluctantly the waiter took the key from his pocket and handed it to
  Betcher Long, who slipped it into the lock of the door and tried to turn
  it.</p>

  <p>"This doesn't fit," he said. "In fact, this pass-key doesn't function on
  the third floor at all, does it?"</p>

  <p>The waiter did not answer this, again shooting that furtive glance at his
  master which Betcher had detected before.</p>

  <p>"Who has the pass-key of the third floor?"</p>

  <p>The waiter shifted uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir," he said. "Probably the floor waiter."</p>

  <p>"Get him," said Betcher again, and dismissed the man with a nod.</p>

  <p>"What is the idea, Long?" asked Cravel, when they were left alone.</p>

  <p>"I'll take you into my confidence," replied Arnold Long quietly. "When
  Monkford went to his room after inviting me to follow him, it is an
  intelligent view that he did not lock the door. Why should he? And it is
  obvious to the meanest mind that he could not lock the door if he had no key.
  Therefore, it is a logical sequence that the door was locked by somebody
  else, either from the outside or the inside. I heard Mr. Monkford call the
  office, and I am satisfied that he called the office because he found the
  door had been locked on him from the outside. I heard him say 'Who
  has&mdash;' and then a shot. What he was trying to say was, 'Who has locked
  my door?'"</p>

  <p>Cravel's face was the colour of chalk.</p>

  <p>"I am suggesting, further, that the man who locked the door was you; that
  you had the pass-key in your pocket, and that your running downstairs to get
  the key was the merest blind to hide that fact from me."</p>

  <p>At this moment Rouch came back to report that the floor waiter who had
  been on duty on the night of the murder had gone on leave.</p>

  <p>"I expected something like that," said Betcher slowly.</p>

  <p>"What in hell do you mean?"</p>

  <p>The man was in a cold fury, but he was mortally afraid, too.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to say that I unlocked the door whilst you were there, went
  in, and shot Monkford?"</p>

  <p>"I suggest that you locked the door before he was dead, well knowing what
  would happen to him&mdash;now, come across, Cravel."</p>

  <p>"It's a lie!" stormed the manager. "I had not been anywhere near the door.
  Why should I lock it? You have fallen down on this case, Long, and you're
  handing up all sorts of wild theories to save your coat."</p>

  <p>Betcher thrust his face forward till it almost touched the shrinking
  man.</p>

  <p>"I've got enough theories, as you call them, to put a rope round your
  neck, Cravel, my Terrible Man! Enough theory, at any rate, to hold you for
  the murder of Joshua Monkford. I can take you right now, but I'm giving you a
  little more rope. Sooner or later, you're going to put the rope where I want
  it. If you did not kill Joshua Monkford, you were one of those who planned
  his death. If all I believe is true, I will put your feet on the trap where
  Clay Shelton stood!"</p>

  <p>He had got home! Cravel's lips parted in a grin of diabolical fury; his
  eyes were blazing.</p>

  <p>"You will, will you?" The words seemed to strangle him. "By God, you will!
  Put me&mdash;where you put Clay Shelton! You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Betcher slipped aside and missed the hammer blow that the man struck at
  him. Quick as light, his arm went round Cravel's neck and jerked back his
  head. The manager struck out wildly, lost his balance, and was flung
  breathless to the floor.</p>

  <p>"Gotcher!" Betcher Long was smiling ecstatically. "Touched you on the raw,
  didn't I, Cravel? You've brought me nearer&mdash;just that much
  nearer&mdash;to the place I want to be."</p>

  <p>The man rose slowly; he was trembling in every limb; his eyes seemed to
  have sunk deeper into his head, but he had control of himself.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he said. "You rattled me a bit. No man wants to be compared
  with a murderer, let alone accused of being one! I'll report this matter to
  Scotland Yard, Long."</p>

  <p>"Come up and see the Chief : he'll be glad to see you. How old are you,
  Cravel?"</p>

  <p>The manager did not reply, but, turning on his heel, walked unsteadily out
  of the room.</p>

  <p>"My Gawd!" whispered Rouch, staring in dismay and admiration at his chief.
  "There'll be trouble over this when he reports."</p>

  <p>"He'll never report&mdash;betcher!" said Mr. Long. "Betcher a thousand,"
  he went on extravagantly, "that he doesn't stick his nose under the arch!
  Betcher a million that we never hear one little word about my disgraceful
  behaviour!" He glanced round the room. "You can tell the ancient guild of
  wood cutters that they can put their panels back."</p>

  <p>He went to his room and packed his grip, and carried it himself to the
  hall. The man had brought his car from the garage, and he threw the grip into
  the back of the machine. One foot was on the step when he heard his name
  called. He turned: it was Alice Cravel, and her face for the moment was
  inscrutable. She held a piece of paper in her hand.</p>

  <p>"You haven't paid your bill, Mr. Long," she said.</p>

  <p>He took the account and examined it, and then he laughed until he was
  helpless. The exorbitance of the charge was not without its humour. He handed
  the bill back to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Send it to Mr. Monkford's executors," he said cold-bloodedly. "And, Miss
  Cravel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She waited, her lips tightly pressed together, cold hate in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell your brother I'll be meeting him at Chelmsford one of these
  days? Harry the Lancer was no friend of mine, but I promised myself the
  pleasure of hanging the man who killed him. Good-morning!"</p>

  <p>Her steadfast eyes did not so much as waver, but when he had said
  "Chelmsford," he had read the momentary surprise in them. Wandsworth was the
  jail where a Berkshire murderer would hang&mdash;she had forgotten Harry the
  Lancer.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

  <p class="first">THE office of Mr. Frederick Henry was in Lincoln's Inn
  Fields. He occupied the ground floor of No. 742, and it was as neat an
  establishment as one would have expected in so immaculate and proper a young
  man. His private office looked out upon grass and trees and a bed of scarlet
  geraniums. There was none of the mustiness or disorder which is usually
  associated with lawyers' offices. Iron shelves holding well-dusted deed boxes
  formed a dado about the room. The desk at which he sat was of sober mahogany.
  And if the room held any exotic feature, it was the blue china bowl filled
  with red roses that had been placed on the marble shelf.</p>

  <p>He was standing by the window, looking out upon the pleasant gardens, when
  his clerk announced the arrival of Betcher Long. Mr. Henry looked at the card
  with a smile, and then:</p>

  <p>"Show him in, please."</p>

  <p>He came halfway across the room to greet the detective.</p>

  <p>"You've come about Monkford, of course?" he said. "I wrote to you last
  night, but fortunately I got on to the telephone and found that you had left
  Heartsease."</p>

  <p>He pushed up a chair for his visitor, then seated himself behind the
  desk.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Long, what do you want to know?"</p>

  <p>Betcher Long had not expected to be met halfway, either literally or
  figuratively, and the friendliness of the greeting was a little
  disconcerting.</p>

  <p>"I will be quite frank with you, Mr. Henry," he said. "A few hours before
  Monkford was murdered, I saw him in conversation with Jackson Crayley and
  yourself. You were promenading the lawn under my window. When I subsequently
  saw Monkford, his attitude toward me was distinctly chilly. I want to know
  what was the subject of your conversation and why Monkford adopted this
  extraordinary attitude to one who had hitherto been a very good friend of
  his."</p>

  <p>"That, I think, can be easily explained," said the lawyer. "Mr. Monkford
  learnt from me that you were an admirer of Miss Nora Sanders and had sent her
  a valuable ring."</p>

  <p>For a second the detective was staggered. Not in his wildest moments had
  he dreamt that this little act of deception on his part was the cause of
  Monkford's curious attitude toward him.</p>

  <p>"And why should that have affected Mr. Monkford?" he demanded. "Even
  supposing it were true that I was in love with Nora Sanders and sent her a
  present, why should he be annoyed?" Henry regarded him with a queer smile.
  Mr. Henry had a peculiar sense of humour, and the situation had its amusing
  side.</p>

  <p>"Because Monkford was in love with her himself," he said, and was well
  satisfied with the effect of his announcement.</p>

  <p>"In love with her?" repeated Betcher incredulously.</p>

  <p>"So much in love with her," said the lawyer, emphasizing every word, "that
  on the afternoon preceding his death he made a will in favour of Nora
  Sanders, leaving her his entire fortune!"</p>

  <p>Betcher Long got up to his feet with deliberation. "Like hell he did!" he
  said slowly.</p>

  <p>The lawyer shrugged his shoulders, and his gesture was one that indicated
  both his indifference to the eccentricity of the dead Monkford and all its
  consequences.</p>

  <p>"I have the will in my possession," he said. "It was drawn up at
  Monkford's request and witnessed by myself and Crayley."</p>

  <p>"Who are the executors?" asked the detective, after a moment's
  thought.</p>

  <p>"Miss Sanders herself is the sole executrix. Naturally I advised him
  against making such a will, and suggested he should send for his own lawyer,
  and I was very strongly opposed to Miss Sanders being the sole
  executrix&mdash;I wished the estate to be administered by the Public
  Executor. But he was very firm on the point. He told me he intended to see
  you after dinner and explain what he had done. I rather think that he was in
  some fear of an immediate death, and he wished the will made immediately. I
  advised him strongly against it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You told me that before." Betcher's voice was cold, his whole manner
  sceptical; but, happily, Mr. Henry was not susceptible to an antagonistic
  atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Betcher Long had never thought so quickly or so surely in his life. He
  made one lightning review of the case from the very moment he had arrested
  Clay Shelton till this identical moment when he stood watching the shadows of
  the trees throw dancing arabesques of green and purple upon the lawn.</p>

  <p>"I've got to work fast," he said slowly. "Faster than the
  fastest&mdash;and I'll do it, I'll betcher!"</p>

  <p>The lawyer's expression was one of inquiry.</p>

  <p>"I don't see exactly how this affects you, Mr. Long."</p>

  <p>"It affects me a whole lot," said Betcher. "What is to-
  day&mdash;Wednesday?"</p>

  <p>He had a boyish trick of counting on the tips of his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday." , He paused at Sunday.
  "Four days are a lot of days&mdash;ninety-six hours. Now, the question is,"
  he mused, "can I keep awake for ninety-six hours? Because, if I can, there
  are quite a number of people going to toe the chalk mark and pass out into a
  better and, I hope, a brighter world. How old are you, mister?"</p>

  <p>"I?" said the lawyer, in surprise. "I'm twenty-three or twenty-four, I'm
  not quite certain which. Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"You look younger, that's all. I'm naturally complimentary." And then,
  abruptly: "Where can I find Crayley?"</p>

  <p>"At his club," suggested Mr. Henry.</p>

  <p>"The Arts and Sciences, isn't it? Pretty inappropriate, for Jackson is
  neither artful nor scientific, and if he isn't a squealer, I've never met
  one."</p>

  <p>"A squealer?" Henry caressed his little black moustache. "It never struck
  me that Jackson Crayley would squeal, as you call it."</p>

  <p>"Betcher he does!" Mr. Long nodded his head emphatically. "Betcher a
  thousand he squeals before the hot irons touch him!"</p>

  <p>Henry laughed.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to put him to the torture?" he asked drily. "And if you do,
  what do you expect to find? That the will is a fake and that Mr. Monkford's
  signature is a forgery? Really, Long, I never dreamt that that kind of
  detective existed outside of melodrama."</p>

  <p>Betcher Long grinned as he took up his hat and walked to the door.</p>

  <p>"Melodrama&mdash;you've said it! That's what this is going to be, a
  melodrama with all the villains under arrest in the last act and virtue
  triumphant! Ever heard of Elmstrong, the fellow who poisoned his wife down in
  Hereford? He was a lawyer, and they hanged him."</p>

  <p>"Well, what about it?" asked the amused Henry.</p>

  <p>"It was a hell of a good precedent," said Betcher.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

  <p class="first">A BOULDER dropped into a piece of delicate mechanism does
  not more completely disorganize the smooth running of the machinery than does
  any extraordinary act which throws out of gear the revolution of the social
  wheel. Miss Revelstoke confessed bitterly that her season was wasted.
  Usually, she spent a month at Heartsease, staying on for three weeks after
  the festival, and from Berkshire she journeyed immediately to Scotland, where
  she usually spent another month before she went on to Aix.</p>

  <p>"I have three weeks to spend in London," she said, "when everybody is out
  of town!"</p>

  <p>Nora suggested a French <i>plage</i>.</p>

  <p>The horror of Mr. Monkford's death was still upon her; she could not shake
  off the impression of the tragedy, and the knowledge that the Terrible People
  were a reality. Although she had not spoken to Arnold Long about the
  mysterious confederation since that memorable journey to Bourne End, he had
  told her enough then to convince her that Mr. Monkford's death was due to
  their machinations. She had tried, unsuccessfully, to elicit the views of her
  employer.</p>

  <p>"Stuff and rubbish!" said Miss Revelstoke. "The Terrible People, indeed! I
  don't know what has come over Scotland Yard that they should listen to such
  preposterous nonsense! Happily, Mr. Inspector Long will not be in a position
  to spread these romantic stories after this week."</p>

  <p>The girl listened, disturbed.</p>

  <p>"But surely they are not blaming him for Mr. Monkford's death?"</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't they?" demanded Miss Revelstoke. "Wasn't he sent to
  Heartsease to protect the wretched man? And how well he protected him!"</p>

  <p>"The Terrible People&mdash;" began Nora.</p>

  <p>"Terrible fiddlesticks! Write to the Cap Martin Hotel, Bournemouth, and
  ask them if the suite I had two years ago is unoccupied; and please get the
  Terrible People out of your silly little head, my dear."</p>

  <p>She glanced out of the window as a taxicab drew up to the door and a
  silk-hatted man alighted.</p>

  <p>"Here is the faithful Henry, and he seems in rather a hurry."</p>

  <p>It was not until Henry had been in Miss Revelstoke's study for twenty
  minutes that the girl was sent for, and the news she heard stunned her.</p>

  <p>"Two million pounds&mdash;for me!" she gasped. "It can't possibly be
  true!"</p>

  <p>She sat white and shaking, looking from one to the other. Mr. Henry was
  smiling with good-natured amusement.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you'll have to accept the responsibility of the estate, Nora,"
  he said. "I want you to let me act for you and apply for probate. Most of his
  assets are liquid, and by the terms of the will you receive one million two
  hundred thousand immediately."</p>

  <p>"The sly old fox! He was in love with you, after all!" Miss Revelstoke's
  black eyes transfixed the girl.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but " stammered Nora helplessly.</p>

  <p>The elder woman put her arm about her shoulder, and, for some reason which
  the girl could not understand, she shuddered. It was as though a flexible bar
  of steel had gripped her, and the unsuspected strength in the woman's arm was
  a little frightening.</p>

  <p>"You go upstairs and lie down. I'll talk to Henry about this legacy. It
  isn't to be expected that she should take in her good fortune." She was
  addressing the lawyer.</p>

  <p>Meekly, Nora Sanders allowed herself to be taken up to her room. The door
  closed on Miss Revelstoke, leaving Nora to order her scattered thoughts.</p>

  <p>Two million pounds! It was incredible! Presently she would wake up and
  find that she had been dreaming. But it was a very vivid dream. She looked
  round the room, cataloguing every article that met her eye. The bureau, a
  little writing desk, the portrait of her father that hung above, the open
  window&mdash;a man was standing on the opposite side of the street, and her
  heart leapt as he raised his hand in greeting.</p>

  <p>It was Betcher Long! He put his finger to his lips and then beckoned her
  to the street and raised three fingers. Three o'clock! She looked at the
  timepiece on the desk: it was then half-past twelve. She nodded. But where?
  He carried a newspaper under his arm, but this he unfolded and showed a
  full-page advertisement which had occupied that space in every morning
  newspaper. It was the announcement of a bargain sale at Cloche's. She
  nodded.</p>

  <p>And then, again, he put his finger to his lips. She was not to tell Miss
  Revelstoke. She signalled her understanding, and he walked on with a little
  wave of his hand and disappeared. She wondered what the other people in the
  gardens thought of these eccentric signals of his, but apparently his
  presence had passed unnoticed. Nobody in Miss Revelstoke's house had seen
  him. Why had he not telephoned? There were two instruments in the house, one
  in the hall and one in Miss Revelstoke's study, both within her
  hearing&mdash;but then, of course, it was impossible that she could carry on
  a conversation without her employer's knowledge.</p>

  <p>When the lunch gong sounded, she went downstairs, and passing through the
  open door of the drawing room, arrived in time to hear the end of a vigorous
  denunciation of French <i>plages</i> by Miss Revelstoke.</p>

  <p>It was not what she heard but what she saw that astonished her. She had
  not been into the drawing room since the night of Betcher Long's visit, and
  now she saw that there was an oil painting above the mantelpiece, but it was
  not the picture of a beautiful and youthful Miss Revelstoke that had been
  there before they left for Heartsease. The sallow-faced woman smiled as she
  caught and interpreted the glance.</p>

  <p>"I meant to have that picture taken away a long time ago. And now, thank
  heavens! it has gone! The portrait was too ghastly a reminder of my great
  age," she said. "Nora, my dear, we have been discussing your good fortune. I
  want you to be sensible and appoint Mr. Henry to act for you."</p>

  <p>It was a little bewildering to the girl that she should be so important,
  and she needed an agent; and she laughed self-consciously.</p>

  <p>"I'm in the state of mind when I prefer that anybody should act except
  me!" she confessed. "I still cannot understand why Mr. Monkford should have
  left me his money; it is almost impossible to believe."</p>

  <p>"He might have left it in worse hands," said Miss Revelstoke, practically,
  as she led the way to her study. "Poor Joshua was queer. But in this case I
  think he has behaved perfectly sanely. He liked you, Nora. Of course, he
  liked you!" she scoffed at the girl's silent protest. "And therein he showed
  most excellent taste!"</p>

  <p>On the blotting pad of the library table were two written documents.</p>

  <p>"You sign on the dotted line," said Mr. Henry humorously, quoting from an
  American comedy that had recently been staged. "The first of these is a
  formal assignment of your responsibility; the second is a letter authorizing
  me to act for you. A power of attorney will have to be signed again before a
  commissioner of oaths, but the letter will serve for the moment. As soon as
  this is signed, half your worries and doubts will be transferred to my
  shoulders."</p>

  <p>She sat down in the chair by the desk and took up the pen, hesitating. She
  was being asked to do something definite. It was as though the signing of
  those papers placed her in the position of a claimant to that to which she
  had no moral title.</p>

  <p>"Must I sign these now? I am so confused that I don't quite realize what
  is happening. Won't you leave them till this evening, until I've got over the
  shock?"</p>

  <p>She was looking at Henry and she did not see the swift warning glance that
  Miss Revelstoke sent in his direction.</p>

  <p>"Why, certainly! We can do nothing to-day. Miss Revelstoke will explain
  them to you&mdash;I would rather you understood before you signed. So long as
  I get these papers by the first post in the morning, there is no immediate
  hurry."</p>

  <p>Miss Revelstoke gathered up the documents, opened the safe, and put them
  in.</p>

  <p>"And now let us have lunch," she said almost gaily.</p>

  <p>Henry left the house at half-past two, and the girl went straight to the
  study, where she knew her employer would be.</p>

  <p>"May I go out for an hour?" she said. "I think a walk would do a lot to
  clear my head."</p>

  <p>The woman eyed her steadily.</p>

  <p>"A very good idea," she said, bit her lip in thought, and then:</p>

  <p>"I don't think it would be wise of you to discuss this matter until Henry
  has put the will in legal shape. And the last person in the world you ought
  to speak to on the matter is Mr. Long. I suppose I am prejudiced against
  Long&mdash;the truth is, I don't like his father. He once put me in a very
  embarrassing position by his boorishness."</p>

  <p>It was news to the girl that Miss Revelstoke was even acquainted with Sir
  Godley Long. She had never met the banker, and when, in her curiosity, she
  had turned up a popular work of reference, the details concerning Betcher's
  parent were meagre and uninformative. It struck her that Miss Revelstoke was
  not entirely agreeable to the afternoon jaunt.</p>

  <p>"Where will you go?" she asked.</p>

  <p>To Nora Sanders, even such a mild deception as this was repugnant. She
  could, however, tell the truth.</p>

  <p>"I will go through the Park and probably call at Cloche's; there is a sale
  on," she said.</p>

  <p>The elder woman smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"My dear, you are in a financial position which makes you superior to
  sales!" she said. "Still, it will be an occupation for you. Be back by five
  o'clock."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

  <p class="first">CLOCHE'S is a big store, and since it had been impossible
  for Betcher Long to tell her exactly the spot where they would meet, she
  lingered for a while at the main entrance, but saw no sign of him, and then
  strolled into the shop. The ground floor of the store was crowded, and she
  looked left and right, expecting every moment to see the detective. But still
  there were no signs of him, and she began to think that she had misunderstood
  his signal or that some unexpected call had prevented his keeping the
  appointment, when a commissionaire with a sweeping cavalry moustache
  approached her and touched his cap.</p>

  <p>"We have found your bag, miss; it is in the lost property office. Will you
  come this way?"</p>

  <p>Before she could protest that she had lost no bag, he had turned and was
  marching ahead of her, and she followed, vainly striving to overtake him to
  tell him of his mistake. He turned into a little bureau above which was
  painted "Lost Property" and here she came up with him.</p>

  <p>"I think you've made a mistake; I've lost no bag," she began.</p>

  <p>He opened a door, showing a smaller waiting room. "Will you come in,
  miss?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I tell you I have lost nothing." She was a little irritated by his
  stupidity.</p>

  <p>He almost pushed her into the room and closed the door behind her.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me for appearing like a stage detective," said Betcher, as he
  stripped his moustache. "But you simply must lose a bag!"</p>

  <p>She stared at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"I hate doing this sort of thing," said Betcher. "I feel that I am
  infringing somebody's copyright. But old Cloche is a great friend of ours,
  and there was no other way of approaching you without giving a lot of
  information to the gentleman who trailed you into the shop and has probably
  been following you all afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Following me?" she repeated, incredulously. "Surely you're mistaken?"</p>

  <p>"So far from being mistaken, I know the man, his name and address, and his
  previous convictions," grinned Betcher. "The commissionaire's coat was loaned
  for the occasion, and Cloche has so many liveried servants that one more or
  less was not noticed. You've heard of your luck?"</p>

  <p>"Is it true?" she asked. "I can't believe it."</p>

  <p>"It is true all right," he said quietly. "The will is beyond
  dispute&mdash;in the circumstances. Monkford is alleged to have signed it on
  the afternoon of his death, which, by the way, was the first of
  August&mdash;does that strike you as being very significant?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"Was it remarkable that he should die on the first of August?"</p>

  <p>And then, in a flash, she remembered the old power boat moored near
  Monkford's lawn, and the dates that had been carved behind the moving
  panel.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she gasped, and turned pale.</p>

  <p>"The prophecy was fulfilled, that is all. If it had been on the second of
  August they would have been a day out, and the inscription would have been
  inartistic." And then, abruptly, "What documents has Henry asked you to
  sign?"</p>

  <p>She sat down suddenly.</p>

  <p>"How on earth did you know?" she asked, amazement in her face.</p>

  <p>"Have you signed anything?" he demanded quickly. She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not yet."</p>

  <p>"Then they <i>have</i> asked you to sign something&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>"I don't really understand what it is, but apparently it is quite in
  order. Mr. Henry showed me two papers, one authorizing him to act for me, and
  the other an assignment&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll sign neither," he interrupted. "You understand?"</p>

  <p>"But Mr. Henry is a lawyer and he is acting for me."</p>

  <p>"He will not act for you, and you will sign nothing&mdash;is that clear?"
  said Betcher roughly. He took from his pocket a folded paper and smoothed it
  open on the table. "I'm going to test your confidence in me," he said, and he
  was very earnest. "This letter is an authority to Wilkins, Harding &amp;
  Bayne, my father's lawyers, and I want you to sign it. I will see that it is
  delivered this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she asked, looking up at him.</p>

  <p>"I guess it is nearly a duplicate of the document that Mr. Henry wanted
  you to sign&mdash;an authorization to act. In other words, you put your
  affairs in the hands of a firm of lawyers&mdash;above suspicion."</p>

  <p>She looked up at him quickly.</p>

  <p>"Are you serious?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Then, Mr. Henry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Henry is not above suspicion, for many reasons which I cannot explain
  at the moment. Will you do this for me, Nora?"</p>

  <p>She took up the pen from the table, dipped it in the ink, and, without
  reading the document, signed.</p>

  <p>"There is going to be an awful scene when I tell Miss Revelstoke what I
  have done," she said, with a sense of coming trouble.</p>

  <p>"You need not tell Miss Revelstoke until to-morrow. When were you supposed
  to sign Henry's little dossier? To-night, eh? They are fast workers, without
  a doubt! Do you think, if you tried very hard, you could tell a lie?"</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't care to lie, but if you wish me to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tell Miss Revelstoke that you have decided to put your affairs in the
  hands of your father's lawyers, and that they will consult with Henry. You
  can add, to justify your action, that, as Henry is one of the witnesses of
  the will, you think it best that an outsider should watch your
  interests."</p>

  <p>There was a small handbag on the table. He picked this up and smilingly
  put it into her hand.</p>

  <p>"You have recovered your lost property, and the gentleman who is watching
  you from outside is growing very impatient."</p>

  <p>"When can I see you again, Mr. Long? I'm rather scared about the whole
  thing."</p>

  <p>"I shall be seeing you again in five minutes, and in all probability I
  shall be within a few yards of you for the next week," he said, and took her
  hand in his. And then he said a strange thing:</p>

  <p>"You're going to have a bad time; it would be wicked not to tell you
  this," he said, lowering his voice and looking her straight in the eyes. "But
  you are the kind who will stand up to anything that comes your way, and if it
  is any comfort to know that there are eighteen thousand policemen in London
  all doing their best for you, and that one miserable inspector will be going
  gray in the course of the next few days, entirely on your behalf, why, then
  you will be able to get through and not look a day older!"</p>

  <p>A second later, she was out in the busy store, curious to discover who was
  watching her. Apparently, every member of the crowd was intent upon his own
  business, but presently she saw a man glance furtively toward her. Almost
  immediately he turned his eyes away, but she knew instinctively that he was
  the watcher.</p>

  <p>She walked through a few departments and made a purchase or two, and every
  time she furtively glanced back she saw this respectable gentleman within a
  few paces of her.</p>

  <p>Why should she be watched? What danger threatened her? For some remarkable
  reason, the warning which Betcher Long had given, and which, considering the
  matter soberly, she knew should have reduced her to a condition of panic,
  neither frightened nor disturbed her. Rather, it gave her courage to meet the
  inevitable disapproval of her employer as the lesser of the trials that lay
  ahead.</p>

  <p>She did not wait for Miss Revelstoke to remind her about the documents,
  but as soon as she had gone to her room and changed, she went down in search
  of the woman. She found her in the drawing room, a piece of fine sewing in
  her hands, and Miss Revelstoke looked up over the glasses which she wore when
  she was thus engaged.</p>

  <p>"I have decided to put my affairs in the hands of my father's lawyers,"
  said Nora, without preliminary.</p>

  <p>Miss Revelstoke put down her sewing, took off her glasses, folded them
  carefully, and placed them on the table by her side.</p>

  <p>"When did you arrive at that decision, Nora?"</p>

  <p>"This afternoon," said the girl boldly. "I have been thinking the matter
  over, and it occurred to me that it was very undesirable that Mr. Henry, who
  had so much to do with the making of this extraordinary will, should act for
  me."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

  <p class="first">MISS REVELSTOKE pinched her lip thoughtfully, and her dark
  eyes did not leave the girl's face. "That was very considerate of you," she
  said, and there was a note of faint irony in her voice; "and I am sure that
  Henry will appreciate your consideration. Unfortunately, I have already told
  him to go ahead and put Monk ford's affairs in order, so I am afraid, my
  dear, you'll have to change your mind. It would be extremely awkward for me,
  and I should look a perfect fool otherwise."</p>

  <p>Nora's mouth was dry; she was seized with an unexpected terror in the face
  of the woman's opposition.</p>

  <p>"I have already written to my father's lawyer's," she managed to say.</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" Miss Revelstoke put on her glasses again and threaded the needle
  with great deliberation. "That is unfortunate. I thought that you would be
  guided by me in this matter. However, it cannot be helped. Will you tell
  Jennings that I shall want the car in half an hour?" She had taken the matter
  very calmly, but Nora, who knew her employer, was not deceived. Miss
  Revelstoke was in a cold fury, though the hand that held the needle had not
  trembled and her voice was as steady and as untroubled as ever it had been.
  But the two red spots which came into her cheeks were beyond her power to
  control.</p>

  <p>From her room she saw the car drive away and went downstairs again, with a
  sense of relief that she was for a moment free from the woman's oppressive
  presence.</p>

  <p>Her position was becoming a little impossible; that had occurred to her on
  her way back from the store. And yet she could find no reasonable excuse for
  leaving Colville Gardens. Indeed, she realized that she had a great deal for
  which she should be thankful to Miss Revelstoke. The woman had treated her
  kindly and humanly. She had made no undue demands upon her time, and was the
  first employer Nora had had who had not treated her as an upper servant.</p>

  <p>It was nearly six o'clock before Miss Revelstoke returned, and the trip
  she had taken had evidently dispelled her anger, for she was in her most
  humorous mood.</p>

  <p>She sent for the girl as soon as she returned.</p>

  <p>"I've been up to see Henry," she said. "And Henry, not unnaturally, is a
  little peevish, but he quite understands your point of view and he thinks on
  the whole that you're right. Will you write and tell him? What is the name of
  your father's lawyers? He asked me that."</p>

  <p>Nora realized with a sense of dismay that she did not know! The detective
  had told her, but she had forgotten almost instantly. Whether Miss Revelstoke
  detected her confusion or not, she did not pursue her inquiry.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately, Henry hadn't got very far," she said. "He had already been
  in communication with Monkford's own lawyers, and they are annoyed, too. The
  worst of these wretched lawyers is that they all want their picking from an
  estate like Monkford's. The will will not be contested, you will be pleased
  to know. Monkford had no relations, and the earlier will he made left most of
  his money to charities."</p>

  <p>She rose from the table where she was sitting with a little laugh.</p>

  <p>"I resent the sense of unimportance which your fortune has given me," she
  said good-humouredly. "Yesterday you were just my secretary&mdash;a very nice
  girl, but, if you will forgive me, of no great importance. To-day, I dare
  hardly give you an order."</p>

  <p>The girl was so relieved by her employer's attitude that she was more
  easily amused.</p>

  <p>"You've already given me several," she said, and the answer seemed to
  tickle the woman.</p>

  <p>"Then I will give you another. 'Phone Henry's clerk that I've changed my
  mind and will dine with him. I met that wretched creature, Jackson Crayley,
  in the city, and he asked me if he might come in and take coffee to-night. He
  had something of interest to tell me. Will you entertain him if he arrives
  and get rid of him as quickly as you can? You can tell him that I have been
  called out unexpectedly. I simply cannot endure an evening of Jackson
  Crayley!"</p>

  <p>She did not leave until a quarter after seven. Dinner was arranged to be
  served at the half-hour, and Nora, who was not unused to dining alone, and
  to-night preferred the solitude, was glad to hear the door close upon the
  energetic lady. Miss Revelstoke's last order, delivered to her parlourmaid in
  Nora's presence, was characteristically domestic.</p>

  <p>"Have coffee served in the drawing room at eight o'clock," she said. "Use
  the Sèvres set; Mr. Crayley is rather fastidious as to his china."</p>

  <p>Left alone, the girl had her dinner at leisure, pondering the events of
  the day. She wondered if Betcher Long knew of Miss Revelstoke's departure,
  and whether he would take advantage of the absence. In spite of the promised
  call of Crayley, she hoped he would.</p>

  <p>Eight was chiming from the silver clock on the mantelpiece when the maid
  came in.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman to see you, miss," she said.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Crayley?" asked the girl, knowing that Crayley was a frequent
  visitor.</p>

  <p>To her surprise the maid shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, miss, it is a strange gentleman. I don't remember seeing him
  before."</p>

  <p>Nora hurried into the drawing room, to find that the visitor was equally
  unknown to her. He was a man of the superior artisan class, she thought, and
  wondered if it was one of the tradesmen who were frequently summoned by Miss
  Revelstoke at this hour to account for the errors in their bills.</p>

  <p>"Miss Sanders?" he asked, in a tone of authority.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered, wondering, "I am Miss Sanders."</p>

  <p>"I've come from Inspector Long to have a little talk with you, if you
  don't mind. I am Sergeant Smith of the C. I. D."</p>

  <p>"A detective?" she asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>"That's my profession, miss." He glanced at the silver tray and the
  coffee-pot. "I'll wait until you've finished your coffee, if you don't mind.
  I'm in no hurry."</p>

  <p>She hesitated and glanced at the drawing-room clock. Mr. Crayley might
  appear at any minute, and the presence of Betcher Long's man would be a
  little embarrassing. As though he read her mind, the man went on "I'll slip
  out the moment you have any visitors, miss. I can see people coming from
  here." Which was true, for the drawing room commanded a view of the steps
  leading to the front door.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you will have some coffee, Sergeant?" she said, as she poured out
  a cup.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you, miss."</p>

  <p>She filled her own, waiting for him to begin.</p>

  <p>"The Inspector asked me to escort you to Scotland Yard. He wants to see
  you particularly to-night." Nora was in a dilemma.</p>

  <p>"I cannot possibly go; I am expecting one of Miss Revelstoke's friends,"
  she said, and the man smiled.</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry about Mr. Crayley; he won't be here to-night," he said,
  to her astonishment. "He's with Mr. Long."</p>

  <p>"With Mr. Long?" She was in the act of dropping sugar into her coffee when
  he made this startling statement.</p>

  <p>"Yes, asking him a few questions, that's all, miss. And the inspector
  wants you there to confirm a statement that Crayley has made. Have you got
  the two papers that Henry wanted you to sign?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I think they are in Miss Revelstoke's study," she said, and hurried out
  of the room to find them.</p>

  <p>They were under a paper weight on the woman's desk and she came back with
  them in her hand.</p>

  <p>"Does Mr. Long want these?"</p>

  <p>"He thought he'd like to see them, miss," said the man, and looked at his
  watch. "We won't keep you an hour. If you'll drink up your coffee, we'll make
  a move."</p>

  <p>She served the coffee and drank half its contents.</p>

  <p>"I'll be ready in a moment," she said.</p>

  <p>She took two steps toward the door, and then everything went black as she
  fell forward into the man's arms.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

  <p class="first">SERGEANT SMITH lowered the girl to the ground, walked to the
  door, opened it carefully, and looked out. The hall was empty. He went back
  to the drawing room, rang the bell, and awaited the maid's coming in the
  hall.</p>

  <p>"Will you go upstairs and pack Miss Sanders's bag?" he said. "She and Miss
  Revelstoke are going into the country for the night. Are there any other
  maids in the house besides you?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the girl, "only the cook. Miss Revelstoke gave the other
  girls the evening off. What clothes will Miss Sanders want?"</p>

  <p>"The things she took to Heartsease," said the man glibly, and he watched
  the maid until she had disappeared on the landing above.</p>

  <p>Returning to the unconscious girl, he lifted her in his arms, walked
  quickly along the hall into Miss Revelstoke's study. From here a door
  communicated by means of a flight of round stairs to the small courtyard
  behind the house and the brick shed where she garaged her car. Since her
  departure, another machine had backed into the garage, an old limousine, the
  blinds of which were drawn. The man opened the door of the car and with some
  difficulty bundled her inside, dosed and locked the door, then, opening the
  gates, he started up the machine and brought it into the narrow mews.</p>

  <p>He got down from his seat and closed and locked the door, then sent the
  car moving at a leisurely pace through Colville Gardens and Elgin Crescent to
  Ladbroke Grove. Here he turned to the left, struck the main road a few
  hundred yards farther along, and, increasing the speed of his car, headed for
  the Great West Road.</p>

  <p>Once or twice he glanced back through the uncurtained front window, but
  Nora had not stirred. The new road runs through fields, but the importance of
  the thoroughfare had brought the speculative builder on to the spot, and at
  one point stood a solitary red-brick house, glaringly new. He turned off the
  road, passed to the back of the house, and stopped before what was intended
  to be the kitchen door. The car was invisible from the road, and behind was a
  stretch of deserted fields. He unlocked the kitchen door, lifted the girl
  from the machine, and carried her into the house and laid her down on the
  dusty floor.</p>

  <p>She was returning to consciousness before the car had stopped. Her head
  was splitting, and she felt deathly ill. When she opened her eyes, the light
  from the window was painful, and she turned away with a moan to face the
  wall. Only then was she dimly conscious of her unhappy position, and,
  struggling up on her elbow, she stared wildly at the man who was surveying
  her dispassionately.</p>

  <p>She looked round. The kitchen reeked of new paint and was innocent of any
  kind of furnishing.</p>

  <p>"Where&mdash;where am I?" she asked dully, as she sat up, her head between
  her hands.</p>

  <p>The man took a flask from his hip pocket, poured out a golden-coloured
  fluid into the aluminum cup and put it to her lips.</p>

  <p>"Drink this," he said. "It is only brandy&mdash;you needn't be
  scared."</p>

  <p>She tried to push the cup away, but he forced the scorching liquor between
  her teeth. The spirit was choking, but it had the effect of reviving her to a
  clear understanding. She looked at the door, and from the door to the man who
  was replacing the flask in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mr. Long?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"In hell, with a bit of luck," said he. "Deader than Harry the
  Lancer&mdash;one of the best lads that ever came out of Deptford!"</p>

  <p>Harry the Lancer? Who was Harry the Lancer? She strove vainly to think.
  The name was familiar in a vague way.</p>

  <p>"Why am I here?" she asked at last.</p>

  <p>"You're here because I brought you here," said the man, "and you're miles
  from everywhere, so, if you start screaming, you'll waste your breath."</p>

  <p>Faintly she could hear the whirr and rumble of car wheels. She was near
  some main thoroughfare, and yet it did not seem possible, looking through the
  window upon the endless vista of green. She might be in the midst of some
  remote part of the country. And then the truth came to her.</p>

  <p>"This is the Great West Road," she said, and the man was taken aback.</p>

  <p>"Great West Road or Great East Road," he said deliberately, "if you try to
  squeal, I'm going to make you wish you hadn't. Keep quiet and nobody will
  hurt you. Start something, and watch out!"</p>

  <p>There was no effective reply to this. She could only sit in wonder and
  fear, as the daylight faded from the sky, and night, with all its horrible
  possibilities, brought dusk and then darkness to her prison.</p>

  <p>It was Betcher Long's boast that he had outgrown sentiment and that his
  interest in woman was detached and philosophical. Yet he had no sooner parted
  from Nora Sanders than he sought round in his mind for an excuse to see her
  again. He told himself that here his interest was professional, but the
  honest ego in him gave the lie to this explanation.</p>

  <p>He had work to do at the Yard, and his office for the moment was a central
  intelligence bureau, for it was here that his men reported every half-hour.
  Soon after eight the detective who was watching Colville Gardens reported
  that a stranger had called at the house and had been admitted. At
  eight-thirty he reported that the visitor had not yet come out. At nine and
  half-past nine this information was repeated.</p>

  <p>Betcher Long knew that Miss Revelstoke was dining with Henry. He could, by
  asking a question, have discovered how far she had progressed in the meal,
  for here again the reports were very complete. He hung up the receiver and
  sent for Sergeant Rouch.</p>

  <p>An evening visitor to Miss Revelstoke's house was not unusual. Nora
  Sanders had probably quite a circle of friends, interests of which he knew
  nothing&mdash;he seemed to remember her telling him that she was taking
  lessons in Spanish, and the appearance of the man as described by the watcher
  was not very alarming. Yet Detective Sergeant Rouch reported at that moment.
  "Come a little drive to Colville Gardens, Rouch," said Betcher, and told him
  of the caller.</p>

  <p>"Maybe her young man," suggested Rouch, with a desire to help.</p>

  <p>"He's a middle-aged person and not very attractive," said Betcher coldly.
  "He is no more her young man than you are."</p>

  <p>"Or you, for the matter of that, Inspector," said Rouch. "She's a very
  nice girl; she ought to marry well, with all that money. Maybe a duke or
  something. It is about time some of the dukes married English girls,
  especially now the American heiresses have got wise to 'em."</p>

  <p>"You've been reading the Sunday supplements," said Betcher severely.</p>

  <p>They went down the broad stairs together into Scotland Yard and turned on
  to the Embankment. It was growing dusk and, as they stood on the edge of the
  curb, they saw a car with very bright lights coming at a rapid rate along
  Whitehall, close to the curb.</p>

  <p>"Speeding, that fellow," said Rouch disapprovingly. "And fast traffic has
  no right to be on the inside."</p>

  <p>The car was less than a dozen yards away and suddenly Betcher Long gripped
  his subordinate and flung him backward, only just in time, for the machine,
  moving at fifty miles an hour, swerved violently to the left, mounted the
  sidewalk, and missed the two men by the fraction of a second before, with a
  grind of brakes, its great shining radiator smashed into the iron railings
  behind them. So close a call was it that a jagged edge of the mudguard caught
  Betcher Long's cuff and ripped it open.</p>

  <p>A policeman came running across and to him Betcher Long turned.</p>

  <p>"Take that man," he pointed to the driver, "and keep him under close
  arrest until I see him."</p>

  <p>And then, to Rouch's surprise, he grabbed his subordinate by the arm, and
  ran back toward Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>To the grim police headquarters there are two entrances, the one from
  Whitehall and the other from the Thames Embankment, and Rouch was intrigued
  by the fact that they passed the entrance of the office, continuing on their
  way to the arch which spans the Embankment entrance.</p>

  <p>"Walk!" hissed Betcher. "In fact, stroll."</p>

  <p>"But what&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't ask questions; do as I tell you. And get ready to jump."</p>

  <p>They were on the Embankment pavement now, and stood on the edge of the
  sidewalk like men about to hail a taxicab. As they waited, Betcher saw a big
  car move toward them from the direction of the House of Commons, gathering
  speed every second. The roar of its accelerator was audible above the sound
  of the passing traffic.</p>

  <p>Nearer and nearer it came, faster and faster, and then:</p>

  <p>"Jump!" yelled Betcher Long and leapt obliquely.</p>

  <p>The machine flew up on the sidewalk, swerved, and, with a banging of
  bursting tires, skidded round until its bonnet was pointed back the way it
  had come. In a second Betcher had leapt upon the running board and, gripping
  the driver by the collar, had jerked him out of the machine. The man was
  unknown to him; a wizen-faced, chinless individual, half-dead with shock.
  Five minutes later he was standing in the steel pen, listening, dazed and
  uncomprehending, to the charge which was read to him.</p>

  <p>"There was a man at each entrance to signal when I came out," explained
  Betcher to his dumbfounded assistant. "The moment the signals were given,
  these machines, which had also been waiting, were sent forward to organize a
  fatal accident. The Terrible People knew that I hadn't a car here and that I
  am in the habit of walking out to get a taxi, and they had probably been
  waiting hours for this opportunity. If they hadn't seen me on the sidewalk
  they'd have charged the cab I was in, on the off-chance of putting me out of
  action."</p>

  <p>They were in a police car now, travelling westward, and it was an
  opportunity for Rouch to deliver himself of certain views he held upon the
  Terrible People.</p>

  <p>"They're too clever for us, Mr. Long," he said. "Ordinary detectives won't
  catch 'em. The little hooks they use for their dirty work know nothing about
  their bosses, and I'll bet you that Ruffy Jones has got no more idea than the
  man in the moon who put him on to this job. Who's this professor he talked
  about?"</p>

  <p>"He's been reading detective stories," said Betcher shortly. "On one point
  I'm certain&mdash;I know every member of the Terrible People!"</p>

  <p>"Ruffy says&mdash;" began Rouch.</p>

  <p>"Ruffy is the sort of man who would say anything for a pint of beer," said
  Betcher. "He's had ten convictions and two laggings, and that hasn't stopped
  him talking."</p>

  <p>Ruffy's favourite offence, Arnold Long learnt, was to act as motorman to
  the hold-up gangs that travel the country and secure a precarious livelihood
  by halting before a jeweller's shop, smashing the window and taking what
  hands can reach, thereafter vanishing on the car into the blue.</p>

  <p>By this time they had reached Colville Gardens, and, stopping the machine,
  Betcher sprang out. He gave one glance at the face of the maid who opened the
  door, and his heart sank.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

  <p class="first">"NO, SIR, Miss Sanders went out an hour ago. I didn't see
  her go&mdash;there is her bag."</p>

  <p>Betcher turned to Rouch, and the sergeant signalled the man who had
  watched their arrival from the other side of the street. There was a brief
  consultation. The watcher was emphatic that nobody had left the house.</p>

  <p>"I've been here for the last hour and a half, and I'll swear that neither
  the man who called nor Miss Sanders has left," he asserted.</p>

  <p>Betcher returned to question the maid and learnt all that she knew.</p>

  <p>"When I came down with the bag, Miss Sanders had gone," she said. "I
  didn't, hear the door close on her, either."</p>

  <p>Betcher strode into the drawing room. The silver tray was still where the
  girl had left it, and he picked up the half-empty coffee-pot and smelt.</p>

  <p>"Smell that, Rouch."</p>

  <p>The sergeant sniffed.</p>

  <p>"That's 'knock-out' all right," he said.</p>

  <p>Betcher went out into the hall.</p>

  <p>"Is there any other way out of this house?" he asked the frightened
  girl.</p>

  <p>"There's a door in Miss Revelstoke's study that leads to the garage," she
  said, and led the way.</p>

  <p>The door was unlocked, indeed ajar. They passed down to the garage, the
  big door of which was also open. Betcher took a flash-lamp from his pocket
  and examined the little building. There was no clue here, and, unfastening
  the door, he went out into the mews.</p>

  <p>Here he had better luck. A woman, the wife of a chauffeur who occupied two
  rooms above a garage in the mews, had seen the car come out and the man get
  down to lock the door behind him. It was a very old Daimler, she told him,
  for, being a chauffeur's wife, she was wise in the makes of cars.</p>

  <p>The detective who had been watching the house and had joined them
  remembered seeing an old Daimler pass in front of the house a quarter of an
  hour after the man had gone in.</p>

  <p>"Its blinds were drawn; I thought it was one of those soft-goods
  travellers' machines," he said.</p>

  <p>He had seen it pass along Elgin Crescent out of sight. A police officer on
  duty in Ladbroke Grove had also seen the car, Betcher discovered later. It
  had gone in a westerly direction, he reported. He had noticed the car because
  the number plate at the back was damaged, and he tried to attract the
  driver's attention, intending to pull him up.</p>

  <p>Only one hope remained. There had been an epidemic of car robberies in the
  preceding week, and officers had been detailed to watch all the principal
  avenues, to detect a Rolls that had been stolen from the sacred courtyard of
  the Houses of Parliament. He knew that he would find these watchers at the
  London end of the Great West Road, and, by great good luck, he reached that
  arterial thoroughfare just as the second of the police officers was leaving
  for the night.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remember the old Daimler," said the officer. "She had blue blinds,
  which were drawn."</p>

  <p>He, too, had thought it was the car of a commercial traveller.</p>

  <p>Betcher sent his machine along the surface of the broad road, stopping at
  every police point to continue his inquiries. He picked up the trail on the
  Bath Road. Here an automobile scout identified the machine.</p>

  <p>"It went along the Staines extension," he said. "You can't mistake it; the
  car has a defaced number plate at the back. The policeman on point asked me
  if I had noticed it."</p>

  <p>Midway between the Staines and the Bath Road end it had been seen again,
  but when they reached the final stretch of the new road and came to the
  filling station on the Hounslow Road the trail was lost again.</p>

  <p>Both the scout and the policeman who had been on duty at the time were
  emphatic that no such machine had passed them. And they had a reason for
  being so sure. An officer farther up the road had telephoned asking them to
  stop the machine because of its battered number plate.</p>

  <p>The police car went back on its tracks. There were two side thoroughfares
  down which the machine might have passed. There were also a number of newly
  built houses; one block of six, and one that stood by itself, and obviously
  empty. Long went to the occupied block and made inquiries which yielded no
  satisfactory result, and he drove on to the house that stood alone.</p>

  <p>It seemed hardly worth while to make an inspection of the place, but he
  saw there was a private roadway across the path, and he guessed a garage, and
  opened the gate.</p>

  <p>The builders had not yet completed their work. A heap of gravel stood on
  the drive, which had not yet been made, and here, on the soft earth, he saw
  recent tracks of car wheels. He followed them until they came to the back of
  the house. And then his heart leapt, for a dust-stained car showed in the
  rays of his lamp.</p>

  <p>It was the old Daimler!</p>

  <p>He looked inside; the car was empty and the engine, when he felt it, was
  cold. He tried the door to the back of the house, but this was locked; the
  windows were fastened.</p>

  <p>The two detectives sent their lamps into the untidy looking room, but
  there was no sign of life. Without hesitation, Betcher pulled out his
  Browning and smashed the window. In another instant the catch was unfastened
  and the sash was raised. The room was empty, but somebody had been here, and
  recently. There was a half-filled paper of sandwiches on the floor, and the
  bread was new.</p>

  <p>And then Rouch, flashing his lamp along the wall, uttered an
  exclamation.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Betcher Long stooped and read. Scratched upon the distemper was a
  word:</p>

  <p>"Marlow!"</p>

  <p>He made a rapid search of the house. There was not a stick of furniture in
  the place, and obviously this had been intended merely as a halfway station.
  But there was in this little villa something which he did not expect to
  find&mdash;a telephone newly installed. He rang up the exchange and revealed
  his identity.</p>

  <p>"Have any calls come through here to-night?"</p>

  <p>There was a pause while the operator made inquiries, and then she
  said:</p>

  <p>"Yes, two; both from London. One at eight-thirty and one just before ten.
  There was no answer to the eight-thirty call."</p>

  <p>Betcher called the local police station. When he came back to the
  sergeant, Rouch was still continuing his search, but he had found no further
  clue.</p>

  <p>"I've sent for a man to guard that car all night, and to arrest anybody
  who comes for it, though it is very unlikely that the devils will take such a
  risk," he said.</p>

  <p>"Where do we go from here?" asked Rouch as they climbed into the police
  car.</p>

  <p>"To Marlow," said Betcher Long briefly. "To the house of Mr. Jackson
  Crayley&mdash; and God help him if any harm has come to that girl!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

  <p class="first">NORA SANDERS'S head was still aching when the telephone bell
  rang, and the man, who had sat in silence for the past hour, rose
  noisily.</p>

  <p>"Don't you try to escape out of that window, because, if you do, you'll
  get hurt," he said, and from the hollow sound of his footsteps on the
  uncarpeted floor she guessed, rather than knew, that he had gone into the
  hall.</p>

  <p>Presently she heard the rattle of the receiver being taken off, and heard
  him speaking in a low tone. Evidently he was expostulating about something,
  but finally she heard his sullen agreement, and then he uttered an incautious
  word.</p>

  <p>"Marlow? All right."</p>

  <p>Then he came back to her:</p>

  <p>"You've got to get ready to walk."</p>

  <p>"Where am I going?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Never mind where you're going; you'll have to walk for a mile at least,
  and then they'll pick us up. That friend of yours is a little too hot; he's
  trailed us to the end of the road."</p>

  <p>Her heart leapt. "That friend of yours" could only mean one man. What
  could she do? She was confident that sooner or later he would find the house.
  Could she leave him a message? She had neither pencil nor paper.</p>

  <p>And then her hand touched the distempered wall, and with her finger-nail
  she scratched the word.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" he asked suspiciously, as he turned his lamp upon
  her.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she said unsteadily. "I can't possibly walk; I'm too tired, and
  my head is aching."</p>

  <p>By this time he had opened the door.</p>

  <p>"You'll walk and be glad that you have a chance of walking," he said
  ominously, and, gripping her by the arm, led her out into the open.</p>

  <p>Until then she had not realized that her aching head was due in no small
  measure to the fact that she had been sitting in an unventilated room. The
  fresh air of the night revived her, and she walked obediently by his side,
  through a little gate in the fence, into the wilderness behind the house.</p>

  <p>Evidently, he was not well acquainted with the topography of the place.
  Once they nearly stumbled into a pond, but, skirting this, they came at last
  to a field-path which led, she knew not whither. Ahead of them and to the
  right she saw the lights of a house, and heard the barking of a watchdog, and
  this seemed to make the man nervous, for he dragged her from the path, and
  they stumbled through high grasses, so heavy with dew that her stockings and
  shoes were wet through before they had gone far.</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour's walk brought them to a hedge, along which he walked
  in search of an opening. After a while, they found a gate and passed on to a
  rough wagon track.</p>

  <p>"This is the place," he said, evidently relieved.</p>

  <p>They turned now to the right, and twenty minutes over this rough roadway
  brought them to what was clearly a main road, for, long before they reached
  the gate that gave on to the thoroughfare, she could see the lights of
  automobiles passing to and fro.</p>

  <p>At some distance from the road he stopped.</p>

  <p>"You can sit down," he said. "We've got to wait a little while."</p>

  <p>She was glad of the rest; her feet were sore, her limbs aching, and she
  sank down to the ground breathless and weary.</p>

  <p>Only now she was beginning to understand the extent of her peril. Why she
  should have been abducted it was hardly worth while considering. In a misty
  way she realized that it had something to do with the Monkford legacy.</p>

  <p>She marvelled at her own courage, and facing facts, she knew that it was
  based upon her faith in Arnold Long.</p>

  <p>"Get up," said her captor's voice. "Here he is!"</p>

  <p>A car, its lights burning so dimly that she did not see it until she heard
  the whine of its brakes, had stopped before the gate, and, grasping her arm,
  he hurried her forward. The gate was fastened with a chain and padlock; she
  had to climb over with his assistance. The door of the car was opened and he
  pushed her inside, springing in after her.</p>

  <p>They were on the Bath Road, and soon they were passing through a town
  which she recognized as Slough. At one place they were held up by a traffic
  policeman to allow a big steam lorry to pass, and she had a wild impulse to
  scream and attract his attention. The man must have felt her muscles tense,
  for he still held her arm.</p>

  <p>"You shout, and see what happens to you!" he said in a fierce whisper, and
  she relaxed into a corner of the car.</p>

  <p>They passed through Maidenhead, turned right and up the hill that led to
  Quarry Wood and Marlow. Whither were they taking her? Not to Monkford's
  house. Then where else? And then she remembered Jackson Crayley and his
  rose-covered lawn, and the little white house that stood behind. Apparently
  this was their objective, for they turned abruptly before they reached Marlow
  Bridge, and through the window she saw the twisted chimneys of poor
  Monkford's home. The next house would be Crayley's. To her surprise, the
  machine did not slacken pace, but continued until it stopped at the edge of a
  meadow. Her arm tightly held, she was hurried across the grass before she saw
  the sheen of the river, and far away the glow of a Chinese lantern that
  bobbed to and fro on the prow of a belated punting party.</p>

  <p>Drawn up close to the bank was a big launch, and into the well of this she
  was assisted. The launch was unattended, as she learnt.</p>

  <p>"There's only you and me here," said the man, as the unknown chauffeur
  unfastened the ropes that tied them to the bank. "We're going through Temple
  Lock, and you'll remember what I told you before. I suppose you know, miss,
  what I'll get if they catch me&mdash;fifteen years! There's no life in the
  world that is worth fifteen years. I'd strangle you where you sit and drop
  you into the water before the lock-keeper knew what was happening!"</p>

  <p>There was a fearful malignity in his tone which made the girl shiver.
  Crouched in the cover of the little cabin, she listened to the chug-chug of
  the engine as it faced the running stream. Presently, she heard the man call,
  "Lock ahoy!" The launch slowed speed and stopped, and then went on again
  cautiously. She heard the rattle of the lock gates closing. Higher and higher
  the launch rose, until it was level with the edge of the lock. The man at the
  wheel uttered a few commonplace remarks, and now they were clear of the lock
  gates and going slowly and steadily upstream.</p>

  <p>West of Temple the river turned abruptly, and the left bank was black with
  overhanging trees. It was toward such a patch that he sent the launch.
  Peeping round furtively, she guessed rather than saw a wooden bungalow, so
  near the water's edge that its stoep was supported on piles driven into the
  river bed.</p>

  <p>"Get out," said the man roughly, and she obeyed.</p>

  <p>He followed her, and, taking a key from his pocket, inserted it in the
  lock and with considerable difficulty opened the door. Stopping long enough
  to secure the launch, he followed her, bolting the door behind him, Striking
  a match, he looked round and found a candle.</p>

  <p>She was in what was apparently one of the two small rooms the bungalow
  held. It was well furnished, but every article was inches deep in dust. On
  the weather-stained walls hung a number of Medici prints; the windows were
  curtained with heavy velvet, lustreless under their coatings of dust.</p>

  <p>"You know this place, I guess? Used to be Shelton's," said the man,
  suddenly communicative.</p>

  <p>Shelton's! An unaccountable fear gripped her. It was as though the spirit
  of the man who had made this place his home, who from here had gone about his
  dangerous and finally fatal work, brooded over the place.</p>

  <p>The man consulted a watch on his wrist and then walked round the room,
  looking at the windows. When he drew one of the thick curtains aside, she saw
  that they were heavily shuttered. Clay Shelton had worked and schemed here in
  the black of the night. At this very table, where the tiny footsteps of mice
  showed in the dust, his marvellous pen had produced signatures so like the
  originals that the men whose names were forged were baffled and could not
  tell them apart from their own.</p>

  <p>"I'm going out to see to the boat&mdash;stay here!"</p>

  <p>Her captor closed the door softly behind him and the key turned. She heard
  the whirr of the launch's engines; and might have realized that she was being
  left alone. But for the moment her thoughts were concentrated upon the dusty
  room and the man who was once its occupant.</p>

  <p>This was the home of the Gallows Hand!</p>

  <p>She shivered. Some uncanny trick of light and shade seemed to people this
  room with tangible shapes that moved and leered at her. So vivid was the
  illusion that she closed her eyes for a second.</p>

  <p>She was standing directly opposite the door which she thought must lead to
  the bedroom, and when she opened her eyes again, they fell upon the handle of
  the door, and she saw with a start of fear that it was turning. Slowly, slow
  ... and then the door moved inward, and round its edge crept a long yellow
  hand.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

  <p class="first">SHE shrank back, her eyes staring with horror at the
  terrifying apparition. Then a cuff came into view, stiff and white, with a
  little enamelled link and the end of a black sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Don't be alarmed."</p>

  <p>It was Jackson Crayley!</p>

  <p>Presently he came into view; his long face was lined, his yellow moustache
  drooped dismally. He was wearing a dinner jacket, and the incongruity of his
  appearance in this place of dust and desolation would at any other time have
  made her laugh. For his monocle was fixed in his eye and the thin yellow hair
  still parted neatly in the middle.</p>

  <p>He stared round the room fearfully.</p>

  <p>"Where's that fellow?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He has gone," she said steadily. "Mr. Crayley, why am I here?"</p>

  <p>He rubbed his chin and she thought his hands were trembling, but that may
  have been her fancy.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said awkwardly. "You'll be all right here, young
  lady."</p>

  <p>There was a pause, during which he surveyed her, the lugubrious expression
  of his face never lightening. And then it slowly dawned upon the girl that he
  was more frightened than she. From time to time he glanced nervously behind
  him, and once she saw him hunch up his shoulders in a gesture of fear, and
  saw that it was the grotesque shadow which the candle had thrown upon the
  wall which had momentarily scared him.</p>

  <p>"He's gone, has he?" he said, referring to her departed custodian. "Deuced
  awkward!"</p>

  <p>He cleared his throat with an effort.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you're in rather an awkward position, Miss Nora," he said,
  "deuced awkward!"</p>

  <p>He paused as though to collect his thoughts, and added:</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose anybody's been in such a perfectly awful position as
  you're in."</p>

  <p>The repetition of those inane words brought a fugitive smile to the girl's
  face.</p>

  <p>"Well, I can't be in a very bad position, Mr. Crayley, now that you are
  here to look after me."</p>

  <p>He did not meet her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, won't you?"</p>

  <p>He pulled a long silk handkerchief from his sleeve and dusted a chair.</p>

  <p>"I've got to have a little talk with you, and I suppose by the time it is
  through you'll think I'm an unutterable cad."</p>

  <p>Obediently, she seated herself, wondering what was coming.</p>

  <p>"The only way you can get out of this fearful difficulty
  is&mdash;marriage," he began disjointedly, "and, really, when you come to
  think of it, one fellow is as good as another fellow&mdash;I mean one chap's
  as good as another chap&mdash;I mean, as a husband."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand you, Mr. Crayley, I am not thinking of marriage, and
  if I were&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," he nodded wisely, as though he had anticipated what she was
  about to say, though in point of fact he had done nothing of the sort. "If I
  ask you to marry me, you'll be fearfully upset?"</p>

  <p>"To marry you?" She wasn't upset, but she was very much surprised.</p>

  <p>"That's it," he said doggedly. "You marry me tomorrow, and everything is
  as right as rain. You'll have somebody to look after you and all that sort of
  thing."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I could never marry you, Mr. Crayley," she said, and the look of dismay
  on his face was almost comical.</p>

  <p>"You'd better&mdash;by Jove, you'd better!" he said urgently. "I'll tell
  you the truth, Miss Nora: I've no more wish to marry than you have. But I
  should be fearfully relieved if you would marry me, because"&mdash;his
  unsteady hand went up to his lips, and again he looked left and right and
  lowered his voice&mdash;"it would be better for you if you did what I told
  you," he said, in an agitated voice. "You promise me on your sacred word of
  honour that you will marry me to-morrow, and I will look after you&mdash;I
  swear I will! If you don't"&mdash;he mopped his streaming forehead with a gay
  bandanna handkerchief&mdash;"Lord! I don't know what will happen!"</p>

  <p>Her bewilderment showed in her face, and he made matters no clearer by his
  incoherent attempt at explanation.</p>

  <p>"I'm the merest child, the merest cipher. I hate the whole cursed
  business! I hate it, I hate it! God! If I could only get away! If I could
  only leave this blasted river and country! I nearly did once, when I was in
  Italy&mdash;actually got on a boat at Genoa, but hadn't the pluck."</p>

  <p>He drooped his shaking head.</p>

  <p>"Hadn't the pluck," he muttered. "God! What a cur I am!"</p>

  <p>She waited awhile, and when he did not speak:</p>

  <p>"I don't know what all this is about, Mr. Crayley, but I feel that somehow
  you are trying to be friendly with me. But marriage is
  impossible&mdash;absolutely impossible. Won't you help me get away from this
  place? Why have I been brought here?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly his head came up and he raised his finger in warning.</p>

  <p>"Stay here," he whispered, crossed to the door, tried to open it and
  finding it was locked, hurried with long strides across the room and passed
  into the room from which she had seen him emerge, closing the door behind
  him. Now she heard the murmur of voices, so low that, though she crept a
  little nearer, she could distinguish no words. Three people were talking,
  deep-voiced men, one of whom spoke in a hissing whisper.</p>

  <p>Then Crayley raised his voice.</p>

  <p>"Can't do it, can't do it! My God! I can't do it!"</p>

  <p>She heard one of the men growl something fiercely, and then the shuffle of
  feet, and she tiptoed back to the place where she had been when he left her.
  If she could only get through the door or one of those windows, the river
  held no terror for her; she could swim like an otter, and if she had not been
  paralyzed with fright, she would have taken her chance on the way up the
  stream.</p>

  <p>The door handle turned slowly, and Crayley slipped into the room. If he
  had looked worn and ill before, he was ghastly now. Again his shaking finger
  warned her to silence. He was listening intently, and presently it seemed
  that he was satisfied that the two who had spoken with him in the darkness
  were gone.</p>

  <p>There was something else in that haggard face she had not seen before; a
  strange, queer resolution, a certain definite set to a face which had been
  almost without character.</p>

  <p>"Sit down and take no notice," he said, and found a dusty chair for
  himself, which he brought to the table. "You've two hours to decide," he
  said, "and then they are coming back."</p>

  <p>"Who are they?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Nobody you know. They are the Terrible People."</p>

  <p>"Are you in their power?"</p>

  <p>He nodded vigorously.</p>

  <p>"In their power&mdash;yes, I'm all that!"</p>

  <p>He seemed to find a difficulty in speaking, in breathing, even. Once or
  twice his hand went up to his scrawny throat. He wore a big black intaglio
  ring on the little finger of his left hand, and it was shaking so violently
  that it was a gray blur and she could not distinguish the figure that was
  carved.</p>

  <p>"Would you marry me to save your life?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to hurt your&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"You're not hurting me," he said roughly. "That doesn't hurt a bit! And
  for God's sake don't worry about my feelings. But would you marry me to save
  your life? Would you marry me&mdash;" he lowered his voice.</p>

  <p>She heard and shuddered.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't marry you in any circumstances," she said.</p>

  <p>"You're in love with somebody else, are you?"</p>

  <p>He seemed to be interested, as if, in his curiosity, he had discovered
  something that for the while took his mind from the fearful prospect ahead of
  him.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't think so," she said. "I hope to marry some day."</p>

  <p>There was a wistful expression in his face that made her choke, and then,
  unexpectedly, he rose and tiptoed back to the inner room. He was gone five
  minutes, and when he returned she saw he was carrying a long army revolver,
  the chambers of which he examined as he turned.</p>

  <p>"Come along," he said.</p>

  <p>She obeyed without question, followed him into the little room which, as
  she had suspected, was a bedroom, and through a narrow passage to an open
  door. A waning moon rode in the sky; she saw a pathway apparently across an
  endless meadow, but, as it proved, to a narrow road that ran parallel with
  the bungalow.</p>

  <p>"Just wait here."</p>

  <p>"Here" was a rickety little garden gate. She followed him with her eyes
  until he vanished in the dark, then she heard his voice calling her, and she
  went stumbling across the weed-grown garden, until she reached another path,
  covered with round pebbles that crunched under her weight.</p>

  <p>He was at the water's edge, bending over something. She heard the rattle
  of a chain, and then:</p>

  <p>"Can you see the end of the punt? I haven't a light, and we'd better not
  show one, anyhow."</p>

  <p>It was pitch black, for the bushes met over their heads. Stooping, she
  felt the steel-bound edge of the punt and felt gingerly with her foot for the
  bottom. She found it at last.</p>

  <p>"Get well to the back," he whispered, and she picked her way along the
  well until she reached the farther end. The punt lurched for a second, and
  then began to move.</p>

  <p>"Can you use a paddle? You'll find one near you." He was still speaking in
  whispers.</p>

  <p>She nodded, though she knew he could not see her, and, groping, found the
  paddle-handle and began to back water. In a few seconds they were in
  midstream.</p>

  <p>"Down river," he whispered.</p>

  <p>On her right she saw dimly the dark bulk of the bungalow.</p>

  <p>"No noise," he whispered warningly.</p>

  <p>Very gingerly she swept the paddle to and fro, not taking it from the
  water, but turning its sharp edge to bring it back into position. They were
  passing through a stretch of river that held neither bungalow nor houseboat.
  Ahead of them was the black outline of a hill.</p>

  <p>It was the hill she remembered having seen as she came up the river.</p>

  <p>A small river launch was passing downstream, and they were just in time to
  catch the lock. Crayley did not speak again until they were clear of Temple
  Lock and making their way round the bend to Marlow. He came to the end of the
  boat where she was sitting.</p>

  <p>"There is only one danger," he said. "If they have missed us, they've got
  an electric canoe near Temple Lock, and they could easily cut
  across&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Something palely white, like an elongated swan, shot out from the bank on
  their right.</p>

  <p>"Paddle!" His voice came in a sob. "To the bank&mdash;we can run."</p>

  <p>The thin, white, sleek thing was moving swiftly. When they were still half
  a dozen yards from the Bucksbank, it streaked alongside. Somebody leant over
  and gripped the girl by the arm, and she screamed. In another second she was
  pulled sprawling across the power-canoe, one foot dragging in the water. She
  struggled desperately, but her strength was no match for the man who held
  her. And then, in a moment of inspiration, she remembered a jujitsu trick,
  and, catching her assailant under the chin with the palm of her hand, thrust
  his head back. For a second he released his hold, and like lightning she
  dropped into the water, dived beneath the canoe, and struck out for
  midstream.</p>

  <p>She saw the flash of a lamp and saw something else&mdash;a red and green
  light coming from Marlow. A launch! Rising to the surface, with all her
  strength she screamed again, and as the electric canoe turned in her
  direction, dived, coming up behind and to the right of it. The canoe swung
  round, but now the green and red lights were nearer. She heard a man shout,
  and a beam of white light shot out from the launch. There was a
  shot&mdash;another&mdash;She heard the whine of the bullets overhead.
  Something struck the water dose at hand and flung a wisp of spray to her
  face.</p>

  <p>She was focussed in a ray of light and a hand gripped her arm! With a
  shriek, she tried to free herself. Better the river than those lurking
  horrors of the night. And then she looked up&mdash;it was the face of Betcher
  Long!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">THE two detectives arrived at Mr. Jackson Crayley's house at
  half-past ten. His sedate butler ushered them into his sitting room, and the
  dregs of pale whisky in a glass and a half-smoked cigar on the silver
  ash-tray advertised his proximity.</p>

  <p>"I will tell Mr. Crayley you are here," said the butler. He returned in a
  few minutes, however, with the announcement that his master was not in the
  house.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen him for nearly an hour, sir, but he very often strolls in
  the garden at night, and sometimes he takes his little power boat down
  river."</p>

  <p>"Where does he keep it?" asked Betcher curtly.</p>

  <p>The butler showed him the way to the boat house. "The boat is there; he
  must have gone in his car." When they looked in the shed where the car was
  usually kept, there was confirmation of this theory, for the garage was
  empty.</p>

  <p>"Has anybody been here to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody, sir. We have very few visitors. As a matter of fact, we shouldn't
  be here at all, only that dreadful tragedy at Heartsease has upset all Mr.
  Crayley's plans."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure nobody has been here to-night?" Betcher faced the man
  squarely.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly certain, sir."</p>

  <p>The detective thought a moment.</p>

  <p>"How many 'phone calls have you had to-night?"</p>

  <p>At first the butler was inclined to give a brusque refusal of any
  information until Arnold disclosed his official position.</p>

  <p>"I believe there have been two."</p>

  <p>"Where is your 'phone?"</p>

  <p>The 'phone was in the sitting room, and, taking it up, Betcher called the
  office. He had maintained a detective officer at the exchange ever since
  Jackson Crayley had come under suspicion, but the difficulty of finding a man
  with a knowledge of Danish had led to his withdrawal. It was the chief night
  operator who answered.</p>

  <p>"Two calls, Mr. Long, both from London. I cut in, but they were in the
  usual language, in Danish, of course."</p>

  <p>"Can you give me the exact times?"</p>

  <p>"One came about half an hour ago and the other earlier in the
  evening."</p>

  <p>Betcher was satisfied now that the latest call had sent Jackson Crayley
  out on to the river.</p>

  <p>So it was not here that the girl had been taken&mdash;where else? He knew
  that Shelton had had hiding places on the river bank, and although one of
  these had been identified, there were probably others. He sent Rouch down to
  Meakes's boat house to hire a launch, and waiting in the garden, paced up and
  down by the edge of the lawn, until the launch came round the corner and
  pulled in to the bank. Marlow Church clock was striking eleven when the craft
  began to feel its way upstream.</p>

  <p>They were midway between Marlow and Temple locks when Betcher heard the
  scream and spun the wheel to the direction of the sound.</p>

  <p>"Somebody on the river bank, perhaps, skylarking," ventured Rouch.</p>

  <p>Again the scream, and then, right ahead of him, Betcher saw the canoe;
  heard the cry, "Help!" The sound was not more than twenty yards from him. He
  flashed his lamp on the water and presently saw a head. A woman! Even as he
  looked, the first shot whizzed past the launch. Somebody was firing at him,
  but he did not extinguish the light. Nearer and nearer he came to the
  swimmer, and now he saw her, and shouted her name...</p>

  <p>She was unconscious when he hauled her on to the cushions of the launch,
  and by the time he had her safe, the electric canoe had vanished. Had his
  attention been less occupied, he would have seen it slip toward the mill and
  disappear in the shadow of the overhanging trees.</p>

  <p>"Get back to Crayley's place," he said, and the boatman turned the launch
  and headed downstream.</p>

  <p>She was wide awake by the time they came to the rose bank, and with
  assistance was able to walk to the house, but not for a long time could she
  tell them of the horrors of the night.</p>

  <p>And now occurred a vexatious delay. The telephoned request for assistance
  from Marlow had brought the inspector. But Marlow is in Buckinghamshire, and
  the southern bank of the river in Berkshire, and a search of the southern
  bank is a matter entirely for the Berkshire police. It was an hour before the
  first contingent arrived by motor tender from Maidenhead, and two motor-boats
  having been requisitioned, the parties went upstream, one on the south, the
  other on the northern bank. The electric canoe they found in midstream, and
  it was empty. The canoe had been salvaged earlier, opposite Jackson Crayley's
  garden as it floated downstream. There was no sign of Crayley, though the
  rush-lined banks were carefully searched.</p>

  <p>The lock-keeper reported that no other boats had passed through the lock,
  and that he had seen nothing.</p>

  <p>"I heard the shots fired and somebody scream," he said. "In fact, I have
  not been to bed, expecting there had been a murder or something."</p>

  <p>Beyond the lock they came to Clay Shelton's old bungalow, and, landing on
  the stage, Betcher forced the door with a crowbar he had brought for the
  purpose. The candle had burnt down until it was guttering in the socket.
  There was no evidence of human occupation. Betcher went into the bedroom and
  found it empty; the door at the end of the little passage was also
  closed.</p>

  <p>"There is nobody here. They were hardly likely to come back," he said.
  "Light the candle, somebody. Or that." He pointed to a dusty oil lamp hanging
  above the table.</p>

  <p>Minutely he examined every article in the two rooms, but there was no
  document or paper of any kind, and the only thing of interest he found in a
  bookshelf against one of the walls. It was a slim volume entitled
  "Weaklings," and the author was "Gregory Bates."</p>

  <p>Betcher, who had made a study of the man, knew that this was one of the
  pseudonyms for Clay Shelton. A clever man&mdash;how clever he was, nobody
  quite knew, or, for the matter of that, would ever know. Betcher knew that he
  held views that were at once novel and reprehensible. He had an itch for
  scribbling, suffering no ill effect from the habit, and this was one of his
  sidelines.</p>

  <p>He turned the dusty pages and was arrested by a passage:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">Man in his relation to society must either accept the place
  made for him by his more fortunate fellows (all of whom are determined that
  he shall not be as well placed as they), or he must jump the hedges which bar
  his given road, and, by his own volition, find a peak and a castle for
  himself. Such an achievement calls for the suppression of sentiment, for
  complete isolation of his personality from any identifiable kind of species,
  and his absolute segregation from community interests...</p><br>

  <p>Betcher smiled grimly as he read, for here was Clay Shelton's whole
  philosophy in a nutshell, and here, too, lay the inmost secret of the
  Terrible People!</p>

  <p>"We shall get daylight in an hour, Mr. Long," said the chief of the
  Berkshire police. "I think we had better put off making any further search
  until then."</p>

  <p>There was enough light to show wheel tracks in the road, but it was a
  considerable time before they discovered the little two-seater car that had
  brought Jackson Crayley to this desolate house. It was hidden in a little
  copse about a hundred yards away from the bungalow, and the dust coat he had
  worn on the journey was still lying across the seat.</p>

  <p>"I wondered how he had got here," said Betcher. "I wonder more how he
  escaped."</p>

  <p>"You'll get a warrant for him, of course?" asked the Berkshire man.</p>

  <p>"Ye-es," said Betcher dubiously. "I could always have got a warrant for
  him, but the devil is that I'm not so sure that his arrest is going to be
  very helpful."</p>

  <p>He knew enough of Jackson Crayley's habits to realize how he must have
  hated that drive in the night; for, whatever else he was, he was
  constitutionally lazy, something of a fool, Betcher guessed, and a
  kind-hearted fool at that. He had a sneaking admiration for this weakling,
  who had faced unknown perils in order to help the girl.</p>

  <p>But where was Jackson Crayley? He was the key to the position, the weak
  link in the strong chain of the Terrible Folk.</p>

  <p>He walked out on to the stage before the house and stood in silent
  contemplation of the lightening sky. Here, by the curious convolution of the
  river, he was looking into the dawn. The trees were silhouetted black against
  the morning sky, and beneath one of its branches he saw what he thought to be
  a broken limb swaying gently to and fro. He called the Berkshire man's
  attention to this.</p>

  <p>"Don't let any of your men go under that tree or they'll be hurt," he
  said. "Somebody ought to cut it down."</p>

  <p>His attention was directed elsewhere, and when he looked up to the tree,
  it was lighter, and the broken limb was visible to his keen eyes. He uttered
  an exclamation, called hurriedly for the launch, and, jumping in, went slowly
  downstream toward the swaying object. It was the body of a man in evening
  dress. His hands were roped behind him, and across the soiled white dress
  shirt was written in red: "<i>Sorroeder!</i>"</p>

  <p>"What the devil is that?" asked the astonished Berkshire man.</p>

  <p>Betcher Long did not reply. His knowledge of Danish was small, but he knew
  that "<i>Sorroeder</i>" meant "Traitor!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

  <p class="first">IT WAS a theatrical flourish, "reported Betcher to Colonel
  Macfarlane." The poor fellow was dead before they hanged him&mdash;shot
  through the heart, the doctor says. "</p>

  <p>"Are they Danish, these people?"</p>

  <p>Betcher shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. Exactly what nationality they are, I have yet to ascertain. Some
  of them may have had their education in Denmark, for reasons which are fairly
  obvious to me. Did I ever show you this?"</p>

  <p>Betcher Long took out of his pocket a little card on which a number of
  dates were written:</p>

  <ul class="smcap"
      style="margin-left: 40%">
    <li>June 1, 1854. J. X. T. L.</li>

    <li>Sept. 6, 1862.</li>

    <li>Feb. 9, 1886.</li>

    <li>March 11, 1892.</li>

    <li>Sept. 4, 1896.</li>

    <li>Sept. 12, 1898.</li>

    <li>Aug. 30, 1901.</li>

    <li>July 18, 1923.</li>

    <li>Aug. 1, 1924.</li>

    <li>Aug. 16.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>"Yes, I have seen it."</p>

  <p>The Commissioner, a methodical man, counted the dates.</p>

  <p>"Why, there is one more than there used to be," he said, and Betcher's
  quick smile was one of genuine delight.</p>

  <p>"Added quite recently&mdash;in fact, two days ago."</p>

  <p>"The first August date was, of course, for Monkford," said the Chief
  thoughtfully. "Do I understand that August 16th&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is my humble self," said Betcher cheerfully. "Yes, they've decided that I
  must go over to the great majority, and August the 16th is the date they have
  chosen, so that, roughly, I have a week to live. And, in a sense, I'm
  glad."</p>

  <p>The Chief stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Tired of life?"</p>

  <p>"Ye-es, tired of this kind of life," admitted Betcher. "Chief, do you
  remember remarking that it was curious that my father had never been caught
  by Clay Shelton?"</p>

  <p>"I remember. Did you speak to your father about it?"</p>

  <p>Betcher nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to speak to him again to-day," he said, and there was a curious
  note in his voice that made Colonel Macfarlane look at him.</p>

  <p>"You're good friends with your father, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Excellent friends. But my aged parent has been annoying me for quite a
  while, and I think it is about time I got back on him."</p>

  <p>He did not explain that the annoyance, which was more or less imaginary,
  was due to Sir Godley's repeated efforts to get him out of the police. That
  morning, when he returned to town, he had found a letter from his father, and
  it was this letter which had decided him upon his course of action.</p>

  <p>He went straight from Scotland Yard, as he had done before, to Berkeley
  Square, and Sir Godley, who was dressing for a garden party, sent down to ask
  him to come to his room.</p>

  <p>"Have you digested my letter?" he said.</p>

  <p>"The kind of letter you write to me," said Betcher, settling himself down
  in the easiest chair in the room, "so far from being digestible, makes me
  feel sick."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh?" grunted Sir Godley, struggling with his cravat.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember my remarking how strange it was that Clay Shelton never
  caught you?"</p>

  <p>"I seem to remember something of the sort."</p>

  <p>"And yet he took sixty thousand pounds out of your bank&mdash;I've only
  just discovered the fact."</p>

  <p>Sir Godley did not turn round.</p>

  <p>"There's the making of a great detective in you," he said.</p>

  <p>"Sarcasm is wasted on me," said Betcher calmly. "Old man, I've discovered
  your guilty secret! In fact, it has been discovered for some days, but I
  haven't had time to spring the bombshell on you. Who was born on June 1,
  1854?"</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows," said his father, carefully examining himself in the
  glass.</p>

  <p>"Who was J. X. T. L.&mdash;John Xavier Towler Long?" asked Betcher
  quietly. "And to save your lying to your only child, I will tell you. John
  Xavier Towler Long was Clay Shelton!"</p>

  <p>"Really?" Sir Godley placed a stick-pin carefully into his silken cravat,
  but showed no other interest.</p>

  <p>"And Clay Shelton, whom I sent to the gallows, was your brother!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

  <p class="first">NOT by a flicker of eyelash did Sir Godley Long betray his
  emotion. "How did you know?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Betcher sat down again.</p>

  <p>"On Shelton's river yacht I found a number of dates carved, and I guessed
  that each one of those had some special significance. The first of these was
  a date which left me in no doubt that it represented the birthday of a
  man&mdash;June 1, 1854. Against this were the initials J. X. T. L. Now 'X' is
  a very peculiar initial, and could only mean one of about five names. I
  searched the records at Somerset House for the name of every child born on
  the first of June with these initials. And I didn't have to search far before
  I discovered that John Xavier Towler Long was born on that day. Towler was
  our family name, the name of my great-grandmother, if I remember
  rightly."</p>

  <p>Sir Godley nodded.</p>

  <p>"I should have been struck anyway by the coincidence of the surname, but
  there, plain to be seen, was the name of J. X. T. L.'s father, which is the
  name of my grandfather, who married twice&mdash;you were a son of the second
  marriage."</p>

  <p>Sir Godley nodded.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you tell me?"</p>

  <p>His father laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"One doesn't exactly boast of one's association and relationship with a
  man of John's character. And, in truth, I scarcely knew him. He was ten years
  older than I, and I only remember him as a young man who was always in
  scrapes, who robbed my father, and disappeared after a particularly
  scandalous episode, probably the most disgraceful thing he ever did in his
  long and wicked life."</p>

  <p>"You know no more about him?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all. Until I saw his portrait in the papers I had no idea that
  he was related to me; and even then, I would not have recognized him."</p>

  <p>"And you've known all the time that he was Clay Shelton?"</p>

  <p>Sir Godley turned; his face was a little bleak.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've known most of the time that he was the biggest scoundrel that
  ever lived, that he broke my father's heart and all but ruined me and our
  family. That is why I wanted you to come off the job. Naturally, I had no
  desire to see you hound to his death a man in whose veins ran the blood of my
  father. And more especially did I want you to keep out of the business when I
  knew that he had left a gang behind to carry on his work."</p>

  <p>"Forgery? I thought that had stopped."</p>

  <p>"It has and it hasn't," said Sir Godley. "Clay, as I will call
  him&mdash;that, by the way, was his nickname as a boy&mdash;must have been a
  most indefatigable worker.</p>

  <p>He probably left behind him a large number of forged instruments, some of
  which have been since passed. The gang is without money. Clay was not the
  kind of man who would save, either for himself or his confederates. You can
  believe me that the Terrible People are in a bad financial position, and that
  is the reason you're going to have trouble."</p>

  <p>"What trouble?"</p>

  <p>Sir Godley shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I understand that Monkford has been killed; you may be sure there's a
  money side to that. Now, you're bursting with news, Arnold&mdash;tell me what
  has happened."</p>

  <p>He listened in silence until his son had finished, and then he nodded
  slowly.</p>

  <p>"They're after Monkford's money, and the girl, of course, is merely a
  blind instrument in the scheme. Poor old Crayley!"</p>

  <p>"You knew him?"</p>

  <p>"Knew him?" said Sir Godley. "Why, of course, everybody knew Crayley. You
  say you suspected him? When did this start?"</p>

  <p>"The day I arrested Clay Shelton in Colchester, Crayley was there," said
  Betcher. "And he was there to cover the forger; of that I am certain. Clay
  Shelton never carried a gun. I examined his clothing after he was arrested,
  and there was no indication that he had had a Browning in his hip pocket. It
  was the 'cover' who carried the gun&mdash;and the 'cover' in this case was
  Crayley, and he bungled it. When he came into the fight, it was with no other
  intention than to slip a pistol into Clay Shelton's hand, and this he did. I
  traced the Browning. It was bought in Belgium six months before&mdash;and six
  months before, Jackson Crayley had been spending the winter at Spa. In fact,
  he was at Spa when the pistol was bought, though we were never able
  definitely to prove that Crayley was the actual purchaser. He probably got
  some Belgian servant to buy it for him, but the coincidence was a little too
  remarkable to get past. Since that time I've had Crayley under observation.
  Father, do you know Miss Revelstoke?"</p>

  <p>The baronet shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've seen her&mdash;in fact, I've been once introduced to her, but I do
  not know the lady, and had never heard of her before in connection with Clay
  Shelton until you hinted just now that she was a member of the gang. I must
  say that it seems extremely unlikely, for she is a lady of irreproachable
  character according to the accounts I have had."</p>

  <p>"A perfect lady," breathed Arnold Long. "Shall I tell you what she
  is&mdash;or was? She was the treasurer and money-holder of Clay Shelton's
  gang. Monkford himself told me that at one time she had three quarters of a
  million in his bank, the proceeds of a mythical brother's estate. She has
  never had a brother, so far as I can discover. She may have been a cat's-paw;
  she may even be acting without the slightest knowledge that she is materially
  assisting the Gallows Hand."</p>

  <p>"Women of that age are naturally silly. You may find that she is under the
  thumb of men like Henry&mdash;and why Henry, with his respectable practice,
  should be under suspicion as a potential murderer, I fail to understand. In
  all probability Clay did organize this extraordinary confederation, because
  he was a born schemer and a brilliant general. But why they should continue
  after his death&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You've already supplied the reason, Father," said Betcher quietly. "These
  people are broke. They have certain documents to dispose of. They've got to
  find money, and revenge is a mere sideline. They killed Monkford so that they
  could transfer his fortune to Nora Sanders&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In whom you are most inordinately interested," said his father, with a
  sidelong glance at him. "And I think I would even tolerate a daughter-in-law
  for the pleasure of seeing you engaged in some respectable and productive
  work."</p>

  <p>Betcher snorted.</p>

  <p>"Banking!" he said contemptuously. "Money-lending on the grand scale! I'd
  rather be a good live detective&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That is what I'm scared about. You'll never be good, but I'm most anxious
  to keep you alive."</p>

  <p>Arnold Long had experienced a queer little thrill when he had learnt,
  after a patient search of the records of Somerset House, that the man he had
  sent to his death was a man of his own blood. Callous as he was to the fate
  of wrongdoers, he had a little creepy feeling up his spine when that fact was
  brought home to him. Clay Shelton was his uncle&mdash;he wondered if the
  Terrible People knew this, and hoped that they didn't! And then an idea
  occurred to him. Arnold Long's favourite weapon was surprise. His most
  successful method was to drop some verbal bombshell and watch the effect upon
  his victim. There were circumstances in which the best-balanced mind, the
  best-controlled face would betray itself, and Miss Revelstoke was both
  self-possessed and sphinx-like. He determined to fire a mine under her feet
  which would at least shake loose the mask behind which was hidden the real
  woman.</p>

  <p>He made this resolve on the way to the nursing home where Nora Sanders was
  lying.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

  <p class="first">IF THERE was one place in the world to which Nora Sanders
  was not qualified for admission, it was a nursing home. So she protested to
  Arnold Long, but he was very firm on the point.</p>

  <p>"I am not run down and I haven't an attack of nerves," she said. "And
  really, I think it is most unnecessary."</p>

  <p>"The doctor says " he began.</p>

  <p>"The doctor!" She was contemptuous. "I felt all the better for the swim,
  and that horrible drug&mdash;what was it?"</p>

  <p>"Butyl chloride," said Betcher. "It is famous amongst violent dopes. I
  will grant your magnificent physique, Nora Sanders; I will accept the view
  that drugging and drowning are the finest tonics that the human system can
  absorb; I know that you could push a 'bus over, and that all you want is a
  day's rest, a best seller to send you to sleep, and a glass of ice water to
  arouse you. Nevertheless, I am going to stand by the doctor, and I insist
  upon your going into this nursing home and seeing nobody&mdash;remember that
  little bit, seeing nobody&mdash;for a week."</p>

  <p>"I must see Miss Revelstoke."</p>

  <p>He scratched his chin doubtingly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know about Miss Revelstoke. Yes, perhaps you may&mdash;in my
  presence. Otherwise, she must not be admitted. I admire Miss Revelstoke
  immensely," he went on, "but she has never struck me as a joy-bringer. I want
  you to get well."</p>

  <p>"You want me to be out of danger, and you think that if you can keep me
  tied down in one place, with a detective sitting outside the door and a
  policeman walking outside my window, I shall not get into trouble," she
  accused him, and was surprised when he accepted this interpretation.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is perfectly true," he said.</p>

  <p>"What happened to Mr. Crayley?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"We don't know yet, but I rather fancy he got clear away," lied
  Betcher.</p>

  <p>"You're not taking any action against him?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"None whatever. In fact, we have nothing but kind thoughts for him."</p>

  <p>When he left the big room overlooking Dorset Square where she was in
  reality a prisoner, he took aside the matron of the nursing home and gave her
  certain instructions.</p>

  <p>"No newspapers of any kind whatever. Magazines, all the novels she wants,
  but no newspapers and no gossip."</p>

  <p>And on receiving the lady's assurance that his instructions would be
  carried out, he went away, easier in his mind than he had been for some
  time.</p>

  <p>They telephoned him later in the day that Miss Revelstoke was calling on
  her secretary at six o'clock, and five minutes before that hour he was
  waiting in the drawing room of the home. She did not seem at all surprised at
  meeting him there, and her manner was cordial and even jocose.</p>

  <p>"You're the very man I wanted to see, Mr. Long," she said. "What has
  happened to this unfortunate girl? Your Mr. Rouch, who isn't the most
  informative of men, told me she had been kidnapped and nearly drowned, but
  that, of course, can't possibly be true."</p>

  <p>By the hard light of day he was scrutinizing her critically. In the past
  week she had become an old woman. He remembered her lineless face, her serene
  carriage, but only the undimmed brightness of her eyes remained of her former
  self. Deep lines had appeared in her face; there was a haggard expression
  which was new, and the firm mouth drooped at the corners. Yet he could not be
  sure that her gaiety of manner was wholly assumed. If it were so, then she
  was the best actress he had ever met.</p>

  <p>"Crayley is dead, they tell me?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Don't tell Miss Sanders," he warned her. "Yes, he is dead."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It is very terrible&mdash;first Monkford and then Crayley. I am very
  worried about him."</p>

  <p>"You've forgotten Clay Shelton," he said, innocently enough, watching
  tensely, "My unfortunate uncle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He got home! The face grew fixed and hard.. The black eyes narrowed in
  unbelief, and then stared at him.</p>

  <p>"I didn't hear you, I think? Your&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My uncle. He was my father's half-brother: I thought you knew that. His
  real name was John Xavier Towler Long. But perhaps you didn't know that
  either? I know quite a lot about Uncle John." He laughed mirthlessly. "He was
  married to a girl named Paynter in '83, and basely deserted her. My father
  tells me that she has been dead only a few years."</p>

  <p>In a second she was her normal self.</p>

  <p>"I never realized you had such discreditable family connections, Mr.
  Long," she said, and looked at her watch. "Do you think I can go up and see
  Nora now?"</p>

  <p>"We will go up together," said Betcher, and this arrangement came as a
  surprise to the woman.</p>

  <p>"There were several matters I wanted to discuss with her in private."</p>

  <p>"I'll put my fingers in my ears," said Betcher obligingly, and reluctantly
  the woman accompanied him to Nora's room.</p>

  <p>She was in bed, wearing a dressing jacket, and she turned down her book as
  her employer appeared.</p>

  <p>"You poor child!" The elder woman's voice was sympathy itself. "Really,
  Nora, you're almost as bad as Mr. Long, you move perpetually in an atmosphere
  of melodrama! Are you feeling very bad?"</p>

  <p>The girl shook her head and fixed her reproachful eyes upon Betcher.</p>

  <p>"I've never been better in my life," she said, "but they insist upon my
  staying here."</p>

  <p>"'They,' of course, is Mr. Long. What a blessing it is for you to have
  such brotherly devotion."</p>

  <p>"Motherly," suggested Betcher.</p>

  <p>The woman looked at him for a second.</p>

  <p>"Can I speak with Nora alone for a moment?"</p>

  <p>He strolled over to the other side of the room, looking out into Dorset
  Square. He had wonderful hearing, and as though she was conscious of this,
  Miss Revelstoke dropped her voice to a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Can Henry come to see you?"</p>

  <p>The girl hesitated and glanced across to where Betcher was standing.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask him, because he hates Henry," said Miss Revelstoke. "I want you
  to see him alone. Can you?"</p>

  <p>Again Nora looked toward the detective, doubt and uncertainty in her
  face.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I believe instructions have been given that I'm not to see
  anybody. Can't you tell me what he wants?"</p>

  <p>"He has something to tell you&mdash;something that Monkford said just
  before he signed the will."</p>

  <p>Then, as she saw the girl's eyes wander again to the detective, she
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Well, I won't bother you, and please don't tell him that I asked."</p>

  <p>"Miss Revelstoke, has anything been heard of Mr. Crayley?" The detective
  heard the words and turned quickly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said the woman, after a moment's thought. "Nothing at all."</p>

  <p>The girl sighed.</p>

  <p>"He was very kind to me," she said in a low voice, "and I am afraid " She
  shook her head in silence.</p>

  <p>Betcher Long knew well of what she was afraid. It would not be difficult
  to break the news of Jackson Crayley's passing.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

  <p class="first">THE next morning, two men stood up in the dock at
  Westminster Police Court, and they were both subject to the same charge,
  dangerous driving of motor cars without being in possession of the necessary
  licences, and both took the six months which was handed to them without
  complaint&mdash;indeed, with evidence of relief.</p>

  <p>"You two fellows ought to be hanged," said Betcher Long, when he
  interviewed them in the corridor after sentence had been pronounced.</p>

  <p>"Say, listen, Mr. Long," complained the chinless man loudly, "we've had
  our medicine, and you've no right to come here bullying us."</p>

  <p>"I've got thirty-three charges I could bring against you fellows," said
  Betcher extravagantly. "Maybe it's thirty-five, so don't get fresh with me,
  or I'll 'prison-gate' you, and you'll be walking out of Wandsworth into
  Wormwood Scrubbs. You were both sent out to murder me, and I don't take
  kindly to homicides with designs on my young life. If you come across with
  all you know about this business&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You've asked us that before and we said nothing," said the bigger man
  sturdily. "It was an accident, as you well know, but being a copper you can't
  take the witness stand and tell the truth. I wonder some of you fellows don't
  drop dead when you're taking the oath!"</p>

  <p>His shifty eyes looked everywhere but at Long. "Come on, bo'," he
  addressed his companion, and they would have shuffled off toward the cells
  had not the jailer detained them.</p>

  <p>"Let 'em go," said Long, with a wicked smile. "And you fellows watch out.
  I'll be waiting for you on the mat."</p>

  <p>The chinless man turned, obviously uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"We've spilt all we know, Mr. Long," he said, more respectfully. "We had
  this job from an old fellow who was trying to scare you, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aw, shut up!" said the other. "You talk too much!"</p>

  <p>There were many things about the Terrible People which puzzled Betcher
  Long, but none quite so much as the mysterious communication which existed
  between some one of the Terrible People and the lowest dregs of the
  underworld. As for the "old fellow," who was also called "the professor," he
  gave little credence to what he regarded as a clumsy invention.</p>

  <p>The Terrible People themselves were a class apart. They were too clever to
  attach to them the drab creatures without honour, without faith, who stream
  through the police courts or the Old Bailey year in and year out, go their
  long and dreary way to Dartmoor and return again for a brief spell of liberty
  before they tramp again their <i>via dolorosa</i>.</p>

  <p>There is no honour amongst thieves. Betrayal can be had for the price of a
  good dinner. They know no masters but their own appetites, no loyalty save
  that which fear inspires.</p>

  <p>Who was the liaison officer? To that question he could find no answer.
  Whoever it was must be in a position to meet the lower world in its own
  environment without creating suspicion or attracting the attention of the
  watchful police. Supposing Mr. Henry were that kind of man, he, as a lawyer,
  would be in a favourable position. But he was without a criminal practice;
  indeed, he had little dealing with the common law, his practice being mostly
  in the Chancery Court.</p>

  <p>Rouch, for all his deficiencies, was an authority on one subject, the low
  thief. He knew every little crook in London; had their family histories by
  heart&mdash;for he possessed a wonderful memory, and was mildly interested in
  their reformation. When Betcher approached him on the subject, he shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he confessed. "If there was any of that funny business
  going on, the organization of criminals into gangs, the same as you read
  about in books, I should have known years ago. But hooks work on their own,
  and the only gangs I know are the scrapping gangs of Hoxton, a few big
  cracksmen, and the race-track crowds."</p>

  <p>Though he was discouraged, Betcher pursued his inquiries; sent two men,
  one to Deptford and one to Notting Dale (the East End and Limehouse as
  hotbeds of criminality exist only in the fertile imaginations of writers),
  and these he reinforced with a small army of police informers, those stool
  pigeons without whose assistance police work would falter in its stride.</p>

  <p>When he got home to his flat that night a letter was awaiting him. There
  was no need to look at the postmark. Scrawled in neat characters on the
  envelope's flap were the words "Little Heartsease, Berkshire," and he
  recognized the handwriting of Mr. Cravel.</p>

  <p>He opened the letter. It was typewritten and dictated.</p><br>

  <p class="quote"><tt>DEAR MR. LONG:</tt></p>

  <p class="quote"><tt>As you may well suppose, the season has ended rather
  disastrously for us. But Mr. Monkford was so good a friend of ours that his
  death overshadows all my personal disappointment. I wonder if you would be
  interested in a theory of mine which may seem fantastic? If you would care to
  come down somewhere about the 16th, when I shall be back at Heartsease, I
  should like to talk the matter over with you.</tt></p><br>

  <p>Betcher grinned. August 16th! It was the proverbial invitation of the
  spider, and he determined to walk into the trap. Perhaps "the professor"
  would be there to welcome him.</p>

  <p>He folded the letter and put it away in a drawer of his desk; but though
  he was smiling, he was not especially amused. The date on the panel&mdash;the
  date in the letter. The blatant openness of it could have only one meaning.
  The date had been carved, the invitation issued, to fix his mind upon a date
  and to give him a false sense of security until the sixteenth dawned. Between
  the sixteenth and that moment lay the period of danger. Every morning must
  dawn a day of doom&mdash;a prospect which was not pleasant. The Gallows Hand
  that had stretched out to hold him and brought low the humble hangman, that
  had struck at the judge, had slain the counsel, and had killed the banker
  whose ingenuity had trapped Clay Shelton, was reaching for him, to pull him
  down at that very second! So intent was he upon the reality of danger that,
  when his servant tapped at the door, he jumped.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" said Betcher, impressed with his own nervousness. "I'm getting
  wrong! Come in!" And in that command he invited danger, covert and overt, and
  stiffened himself to meet whatever fate held for him.</p>

  <p>His valet came into the room and, closing the door behind, lowered his
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Will you see Miss Alice Cravel, sir?" he asked.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

  <p class="first">BETCHER nodded. "Show the lady in," he said, and presently
  Alice Cravel came into the room. She was, as usual, beautifully dressed.
  Betcher knew a great deal about women's fashions, and he realized that the
  two-piece dress she wore must have cost a great deal more money than many
  rich women could afford. But it was not her dress which arrested his
  attention; she was a different Alice from the laughing girl he had seen at
  Heartsease. Her face was hard and pale; she looked as though she had not
  slept for a week. She stared at him in silence until the sergeant had left
  the room.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you, I'll stand."</p>

  <p>He remarked the same quality in the voice as in the face. Evidently life
  was not running smoothly for Miss Alice Cravel, and the change in her could
  not be wholly explained by the disaster which had robbed Little Heartsease of
  its handsome profits.</p>

  <p>Her first words were startling enough.</p>

  <p>"Are you very fond of life?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Pretty fond."</p>

  <p>He had an eye for her gloved hands, which were folded before her, and from
  which dangled a golden-meshed bag.</p>

  <p>"So was Crayley," she said, staring at him.</p>

  <p>Her manner was so strange that he thought she had been drinking, or
  worse.</p>

  <p>"Jackson Crayley loved life&mdash;he seemed a fool to you. You thought his
  flower garden was an affectation and that he wasn't interested in it. But the
  colour of it, the scent of it, made life worth living. Jackson loved pretty
  things."</p>

  <p>He waited expectantly, and all the time he was watching her hands.</p>

  <p>"I suppose there is something that you love in life&mdash;besides putting
  people into prison and&mdash;and on the gallows? Perhaps you love pretty
  things, too? You like to see the sun rise and set&mdash;and the
  flowers&mdash;and the spring " Her voice trembled, and it was with an effort
  that she regained control.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I love pretty things, and I hate ugly things," said Betcher Long
  bluntly.</p>

  <p>He stood squarely before her, his hands in his jacket pocket, his head
  bent a little forward, for she was much shorter than he.</p>

  <p>"I love the things that are good, and I loathe the things that are bad. Is
  that abnormal?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No. But Jackie felt the same way," she said in a low voice. "And now he's
  dead&mdash;dead!" She covered her eyes with one gloved hand, and swayed a
  little so that he thought she was about to fall and pulled a chair for
  her.</p>

  <p>"No, no, I don't want that," she said impatiently.</p>

  <p>"And I'll tell you another thing I don't want, Betcher Long. I hate you!"
  Her voice was almost inaudible, but he did not question her hate; it blazed
  in her eyes, the straight line of her lips was an emphasis. "I hate you! You
  don't know how I hate you! But I don't want you dead&mdash;do you believe
  that? I&mdash;don't&mdash; want&mdash;you&mdash;dead!"</p>

  <p>She hammered her little hand on the table with every word.</p>

  <p>"I want you to live&mdash;live, do you hear? I'm tired of it, sick of it!
  The smell of blood is in my nostrils all the time." Her arms went out wildly;
  he thought she was going to break into hysteria. But again she caught hold of
  her emotions.</p>

  <p>"There's no reason why I want you to live, except that. I'm tired of dead
  men and their ghosts and the things they used to wear and do and look."</p>

  <p>She screwed up her eyes tight with an expression of intense anguish.</p>

  <p>"Will you get out of this case and go away and leave them to it, all of
  them?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you want me to go? I know you've told me. But how do you think I
  could escape, supposing that I cleared out of the case, as you say?"</p>

  <p>"You could go abroad for four months&mdash;for two months, for one month
  would be long enough."</p>

  <p>Her bosom was rising and falling rapidly. The colour had gone from her
  cheeks; they were quite bloodless.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you something," she said breathlessly. "They nearly got you one
  night. I was sent along to prevent your pulling a gun. You remember the night
  they shot at you? And I put up that story about being kidnapped. You saw
  through it&mdash;I knew that when you asked me what theatre I had been to;
  and I don't care what you do with me. I wish to God you'd put me in prison
  and keep me there till everything&mdash;everything is over. I've told you,
  haven't I? You heard what I said? I was in the plot to murder you!"</p>

  <p>"Who was the man?"</p>

  <p>She jerked her head impatiently.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you that&mdash;you know I can't tell you. But I was in
  it&mdash;I&mdash;I!" She struck her bosom with her clenched hand. "Isn't that
  enough? Can't you take me? That's why I came. That, and to warn you."</p>

  <p>"Who was the man?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>"You fool, what does it matter? Why, do you think for one moment I'd tell
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Was it your brother?"</p>

  <p>"My brother was in Little Heartsease that night, you know as well as
  anybody; you made inquiries. The very next day you went down to see him, and
  you put one of your men on to question the servants and the waiters. And that
  didn't satisfy you; your man questioned the guests one by one."</p>

  <p>"Henry?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Henry!" Her lips curled. And then she grew terribly serious again. "I
  risked something, coming to see you. You've been watching my hands all the
  while I've been here, haven't you? But three times I could have killed you.
  You think I am boasting, but I'm telling you no more than the truth. Some
  day, perhaps, I'll prove what I've said."</p>

  <p>His face must have shown some scepticism.</p>

  <p>"You're scared of me because I am a woman," she said, "and you'd hesitate
  to draw upon me. But even if I were a man, you could neither seize nor
  shoot."</p>

  <p>She raised her gloved hand above her head and seemed to snap her fingers.
  There was a brilliant flash of light that blinded him and made him stagger
  back. When he opened his eyes again, he could not see her for the golden suns
  that danced before his eyes; and then he saw a thick white cloud of smoke
  rolling slowly along the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"A magnesium flash," she said calmly. "My eyes were closed when I fired
  the light; yours were open. I could have shot you down like a dog if I'd
  wanted to. Now do you believe me?"</p>

  <p>Arnold drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"You bet I believe you!" he said fervently. "That is a new one on me, Miss
  Cravel."</p>

  <p>"A new one? They've hundreds of new ones," she said contemptuously.
  "They've bungled you three times, but they'll get you in the end, Betcher
  Long."</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadily.</p>

  <p>"I've got an honest fit to-day, and I'm going to tell you something. I'm
  afraid of two things: I'm afraid of their killing you, and I'm afraid of
  their failing! Because, if they fail, the next time you'll have them, and
  that will be the end of everything. Are you going to take me? I'll go down on
  my knees to you this minute if you'll put me behind bars. I'm not crazy,
  Long. I was never as sane in my life. But I'm through&mdash;through!"</p>

  <p>He took the letter from his pocket and handed it to the girl. She had read
  a line or two and handed it back to him.</p>

  <p>"I know," she said. "Are you going?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"On the sixteenth?"</p>

  <p>He nodded again.</p>

  <p>"What do you expect?"</p>

  <p>"Trouble," he said laconically.</p>

  <p>"And you'll get it!" she said between her clenched teeth; "you don't know
  what is waiting for you at Heartsease!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch34"
     name="ch34"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

  <p class="first">THE warning chilled him, but he made no reply, watching her
  as she took her blackened gloves from her hands and deliberately pulled on
  another pair that she took from her bag.</p>

  <p>"I can do nothing with you. That is what I was afraid of. Where's the
  Sanders girl?"</p>

  <p>"In a nursing home," he said, unnecessarily, as he knew.</p>

  <p>"She's safe there, is she?" She smiled as she asked the question.</p>

  <p>"Pretty safe. A detective is patrolling back and front of the house, one
  downstairs sitting on a hard wooden chair all night."</p>

  <p>"They'll get her if they want her."</p>

  <p>"Betcher!" said Long.</p>

  <p>"You'd lose."</p>

  <p>She made as if to say something more, then changed her mind, and turning,
  pulled open the door, to pause on the threshold and deliver her final
  shot.</p>

  <p>"Nora Sanders is very necessary to your Terrible People," she said, and
  her lips twitched. "Vitally necessary. You'll never guess why."</p>

  <p>"Because they're broke," he said promptly, and he saw her expression
  change.</p>

  <p>"Broke? Who told you that?" Her voice was shrill; she was genuinely
  astonished.</p>

  <p>"They're broke. Somebody has been dipping into the reserve and somebody
  else is covering it up."</p>

  <p>She eyed him thoughtfully, pursing her lips.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" she said in a low voice. "But look out for your Nora
  Sanders!"</p>

  <p>Somehow he knew that she spoke the truth. Long after she had gone, he
  paced up and down his room, stopping now and again to watch the feeble
  efforts of his valet to drive the smoke through the open window. For the
  fumes of exploded magnesium are difficult to disperse.</p>

  <p>Then he sat down at his blotting pad and with a pencil drew a plan of the
  nursing home where Nora Sanders was staying. It was true, as the girl had
  said, that he had made the most elaborate preparations to prevent a
  repetition of the outrage which had nearly ended so disastrously for the
  girl.</p>

  <p>He looked at the house from every angle; supposed every possibility that
  he could summon. The end of the Terrible People was at hand. The gang was
  disintegrating before his eyes. But there was a last kick in them.</p>

  <p>He went along to interview the matron of the nursing home. She was a
  homely little body, rather birdlike in her manner, and she scoffed at the
  idea of an abduction.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course, she's quite safe. Especially with the place surrounded by
  detectives."</p>

  <p>As they walked out into the hall, a sound of moaning came down to him from
  above, and the matron smiled. "That is not very serious. In fact, it is no
  worse than a case of nerves&mdash;a young woman who was brought in this
  afternoon. There's really nothing the matter with her except hysteria. She
  has an illusion that she's very ill, and she is welcome to that if she'd only
  keep quiet about it."</p>

  <p>"Isn't she rather a nuisance to the other patients?"</p>

  <p>"We're moving her to-night. I've seen her doctor and I've told him that I
  cannot have her here. The wretched creature can walk as well as you and I,
  yet she insists upon being treated as an invalid."</p>

  <p>He went back to his flat feeling more happy about the girl, although he
  could not wholly disregard the warning of Alice Cravel.</p>

  <p>His servant was out but had left a scribbled note on the table:</p>

  <p>"Please call up Sergeant Rouch."</p>

  <p>He got through to his assistant with little delay.</p>

  <p>"I think I've found the communication between the People and the boys."
  Rouch always referred to the underworld as "the boys."</p>

  <p>"Can I come along to you?"</p>

  <p>"Come right along," said Betcher, and a quarter of an hour later Sergeant
  Rouch arrived, bringing with him a pallid man whom he knew as the best "nose"
  in London. A "nose" is a police informer, and derives a certain amount of
  financial benefit from his despicable calling. And this man, who was known to
  the underworld as "the chef"&mdash;he had once been a cook in a popular
  restaurant&mdash; was unique amongst noses, for he succeeded in maintaining
  some sort of respect amongst the very class he betrayed.</p>

  <p>"Tell the inspector what you told me, chef."</p>

  <p>The chef looked uneasily from one to the other, licked his dry lips, and
  began in his perennially hoarse voice.</p>

  <p>"It's the Perfessor you're looking for," he said. "I've often seen him
  down Bermondsey and Deptford, and he knows all the heads: Kallini, and
  Jacobs, and Paul the Greek."</p>

  <p>"What is he like?"</p>

  <p>"Not so tall as you&mdash;a little taller than me," said the chef, "and
  thin. Always dressed in black with a big tie like them artists wear in the
  pictures."</p>

  <p>"How old?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know." The man considered. "Pretty old. His hair's white, and
  he's got a lot of it. That is why they call him the Perfessor."</p>

  <p>He had never been seen in any of the haunts where men meet to arrange
  their plans or divide or plant their swag. The "nose" knew them all. The Blue
  Cushion in the Blackfriars Road, where some of the biggest jobs in England
  had been organized; the Fishpond over at Notting Hill, where you could plant
  diamonds to almost any value; or that little saloon in the Whitechapel Road,
  where all the big silk thefts were arranged and the proceeds sold almost
  openly.</p>

  <p>"He always meets them in the open. Near the Canal Bridge is one of his
  favourite places. They say down in Deptford that he's a big West End fence,
  but I never heard that he bought anything from the boys, and he certainly
  never hired anybody except for a roughhouse."</p>

  <p>"You know Ruffy the motorman?"</p>

  <p>"Sure I do," nodded the spy. "He's a lad from Deptford. He's just got six
  months for dangerous driving. They say that the Perfessor gave him a hundred
  for a West End job."</p>

  <p>"There is no place where this Professor can be seen?"</p>

  <p>The chef shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No. When he's coming along he sends a message to one of the heads saying
  where he is to be met, and they are closer than oysters. I'll tell you who he
  got a long time ago&mdash;Harry the Lancer. Do you know him, Inspector? He's
  the fellow that a farmer shot in a field by mistake." (This was the version
  of Harry the Lancer's death which had emerged from the coroner's inquiry.)The
  Professor again! Of all the baffling features of the case, he was the most
  difficult to understand.</p>

  <p>Betcher gave instructions to the chef that whenever the Professor
  appeared, or was likely to appear in his favourite haunts, the Yard was to be
  notified. For the first time since the shadow of Clay Shelton fell across his
  path, he was worried. It was not extraordinary that this should be the case,
  for now Nora Sanders had come to be the focal point against which all the
  ingenuity and villainy of the mysterious People were directed.</p>

  <p>He was weary to a point of exhaustion, and he remembered his boast that he
  would keep awake for four nights as he took off his coat and began to
  unfasten his collar. One night's sleep, at any rate, could be snatched; he
  was entitled to that, he thought, with a grin, as he stripped his collar,
  and, walking into the bathroom, turned on the tap.</p>

  <p>Above the noise of the rushing water he did not hear the telephone bell
  ring until he came back to the sitting room to find his slippers. He picked
  up the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Call office," said the operator's voice.</p>

  <p>It must be Rouch, he thought; but it was a woman's voice that spoke to
  him, and although an attempt had been made at disguise, he recognized it as
  that of Alice Cravel.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Long? Get Nora Sanders out of that nursing home quick!"</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Don't 'why'&mdash;just do! You've got less than half an hour. If you're
  not a fool, you will do as I tell you!"</p>

  <p>"But " he began, and then he heard the dick of the receiver being hung
  up.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch35"
     name="ch35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

  <p class="first">A RUSE? Was it a plot to get the girl out of the home so
  that she would be more accessible? And yet he could not mistake her
  sincerity, the intense urgency of her tone. If he understood men and women,
  he must believe she was in earnest, that she was absolutely certain that some
  terrible and immediate danger overhung the girl.</p>

  <p>He called up the nursing home; the matron had gone to bed, but the sister
  in charge gave him a satisfactory account.</p>

  <p>"Yes, your officer is here. Nothing has happened and Miss Sanders is
  asleep."</p>

  <p>He spoke also to the detective, and had the same satisfactory report.</p>

  <p>He walked slowly back to the bathroom and turned off the tap, hesitated
  for a few seconds, then, pulling the waste plug, he began to dress. And for
  no reason that he could define, he was wide awake again.</p>

  <p>It was not until he was fully dressed that he began to feel foolish. He
  could do no more at the nursing home than the man he had left in charge.
  Nevertheless, he decided to take a leisurely walk to Dorset Square. It was a
  fine night; the West End was crowded, for the theatres were turning out their
  crowds, and the streets were lined with flying cars.</p>

  <p>His way led through Berkeley Street and Berkeley Square, and it occurred
  to him that he might call on his father, who, despite the lateness of the
  hour, would certainly be in his study. There was a light in the hall and he
  pressed the bell and was admitted by his father's valet, who usually replaced
  the footman when Sir Godley was working late at night.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the man's troubled face Betcher Long's heart sank.</p>

  <p>"Where is my father?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Mr. Arnold. He went out about an hour ago to post a letter.
  Sir Godley always takes his own letters at night for the little walk, but
  usually he's only away five minutes."</p>

  <p>Arnold walked into the library; the lights were all burning&mdash;a sure
  sign that his father expected to return immediately, for he was rather a
  faddist in the matter of wasted current.</p>

  <p>"Did he take his hat?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, his hat and his walking stick."</p>

  <p>One of the drawers of Sir Godley's desk was half closed, and Betcher
  pulled it wide open. It was empty. He whistled softly. In this drawer Sir
  Godley kept a small Browning pistol. In the old days, when Betcher was a boy,
  it used to be a navy revolver, and once he had been severely spanked for
  allowing his curiosity to get the better of him and examining the strange and
  beautiful instrument that the drawer held.</p>

  <p>Betcher called to the old servant, from whom his master had few
  secrets.</p>

  <p>"Does Sir Godley generally take his pistol when he goes out to post a
  letter?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, lately," said the valet.</p>

  <p>And then the detective's eyes were attracted to the hearth. The grate was
  filled with burnt papers. There was no reason in the world why he should pry
  into his father's business, but he was alarmed more than he dared confess to
  himself; and though these charred and blackened cinders were probably old
  bills which, in a fit of energy, his father had destroyed that night, he
  stooped down and raked them over. One little bundle of letters had been burnt
  <i>en bloc</i>, and in the centre there were some scraps of scorched paper
  that had escaped the flames, but only on one could he detect any writing. It
  was a triangular piece of paper which contained what had evidently been an
  address and a date. The whole of the address was not there, but he saw the
  word "...hagen" and the date 12th of January, 1881. He turned the paper over,
  and half a dozen words written in a beautiful hand were visible:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>... least you can do ... help ... brother ...
     crisis.</i></p><br>

  <p>Evidently, attached to this, had been some sort of memorandum, an oblong
  slip, the charred remnants of which Betcher carried to the light. The ink was
  still visible. It was a bill of exchange, drawn on his father; the name of
  the drawer, however, he could not distinguish. He threw this back into the
  fireplace, the old valet watching him.</p>

  <p>"You needn't mention to my father that I've been nosing his private
  affairs, Johnny," he said.</p>

  <p>The old man, who in the course of his life had stood between his young
  master and many troubles, nodded. "Where do you think he's gone, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Gay!" said Arnold laconically.</p>

  <p>Going out into the square, he walked toward the nearest post box, and here
  he met the inevitable point man, one of those mines of information without
  which the detection of crime would be an infinitely more heartbreaking
  business than it is.</p>

  <p>The policeman had seen Sir Godley and had spoken to him, and had rather an
  alarming report to make.</p>

  <p>"I must say your father behaved very queerly, sir," he said. "While I was
  talking to him a cab came past, and I think he must have recognized the
  gentleman inside&mdash;as a matter of fact, I saw him myself; an old
  gentleman with white hair and a big black flowing tie and horn-rimmed
  spectacles&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Betcher gasped. It was a fairly faithful description of the Professor.</p>

  <p>"What did my father do?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That's what I think was queer. He ran across the road and jumped into
  another taxi, and the last I saw of him he was leaning out of the window,
  giving instructions to the driver. I got an idea he was trying to overtake
  the old gentleman."</p>

  <p>Arnold Long went back to the house, a very puzzled man. He spoke a few
  reassuring words to the valet and continued on his way to Dorset Square. The
  exercise stimulated his mind, and it required more than ordinary stimulation
  to explain his father's eccentricity.</p>

  <p>What did Sir Godley know of the Professor? And why should a glimpse,
  caught in that prosaic atmosphere, induce him to throw aside all caution and
  pursue the cab in which the man was travelling? The Professor! The more
  Arnold Long thought of this unaccountable being, the more puzzled he became.
  He was the one member of the confederation he could not place. More than
  this, he was the dominant partner, the brains and the heart of the Terrible
  People.</p>

  <p>Crossing Oxford Street, he walked up Baker Street, and as he came abreast
  of a line of houses familiar to every lover of fiction, he grinned to
  himself. How would that supernaturally clever detective have dealt with this
  present problem, he wondered? A shot of cocaine, a violin obbligato, and this
  man, like another famous professor, would be revealed.</p>

  <p>He heard a clock chime and looked at the illuminated dial of his watch.
  Half-past eleven! He would satisfy himself that everything was all right in
  Dorset Square and go back to await the return of his father.</p>

  <p>The square was deserted, the only sign of animation being at the Great
  Central station at the far end, where taxicabs were arriving with
  theatre-goers on their way to the country. A man outside the nursing home
  saluted him.</p>

  <p>"Nothing has happened, sir," he reported. "They got away that hysterical
  girl, and an awful fuss she made."</p>

  <p>"The hysterical&mdash;oh, yes, I know whom you mean!" He remembered the
  matron's description of her new patient.</p>

  <p>The officer on duty in the hall was a useful servant to the nurses, for he
  answered the tap on the door immediately. He, too, had nothing to report, and
  the night sister, coming downstairs at that moment, told him that the girl
  was sleeping quietly.</p>

  <p>"I just had a peep at her as I came down," she said. "I was afraid our
  shrieking sister would keep her awake all night."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if I could see her?"</p>

  <p>Why he asked such a ludicrous question, he could not explain even to
  himself. The night sister was not shocked, because she was a member of a
  profession that has outgrown the processes of surprise. Yet she
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether the matron would like that," she said,
  "but&mdash;you must only look, you mustn't speak."</p>

  <p>He followed her up the stairs, feeling exceedingly foolish. On the big
  landing of the first floor she stopped and cautioned him to silence. Opening
  the door of Nora's room, she beckoned him forward.</p>

  <p>A shaded nursery lamp was burning in the room and gave just sufficient
  light to distinguish the figure in the bed. The girl had her back toward the
  door and only a stray curl showed above the edge of the sheet.</p>

  <p>A curl? He frowned.</p>

  <p>And the curl was black!</p>

  <p>In two strides he was across the room, ignoring the protestations of the
  night sister.</p>

  <p>"Here&mdash;you!"</p>

  <p>He dropped his hand upon a thin shoulder and shook it. The girl was not
  asleep. She turned her startled eyes upon the detective. They were brown eyes
  and the face turned up to him was sharp and pinched.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Long, what are you " began the nurse, and then she saw the face on
  the pillow.</p>

  <p>"That is not Miss Sanders!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>Nor was it. Nora Sanders at that moment was speeding as fast as a high-
  powered motor-ambulance could carry her into Berkshire where the manager of
  Heartsease was prepared to receive her&mdash;and this time she would not have
  Jackson Crayley to deal with, but a man who knew neither pity nor fear.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch36"
     name="ch36"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

  <p class="first">BETCHER LONG guessed what had happened before the girl in
  the bed began her stammering excuses.</p>

  <p>"Get up and dress. I'm arresting you for conspiracy," he said. And to the
  other: "Send a nurse to remain with this woman until she is ready to be taken
  away."</p>

  <p>He went downstairs with the night sister, who told him what had
  happened.</p>

  <p>The girl had been brought in in the afternoon on their commendation of a
  doctor. She was apparently in a state of hysteria, and had moaned and wept
  till late in the evening. When the "doctor" called before dinner, the matron
  had asked could she be taken away because she was disturbing the other
  patients, and he had promised to send an ambulance for her later at night.
  The ambulance had duly arrived, accompanied by two uniformed
  stretcher-bearers, and under the supervision of the doctor the patient had
  been lifted into the stretcher.</p>

  <p>"I was present until then," said the night sister, "but the doctor asked
  me to go downstairs to get an extra blanket. I was gone about three
  minutes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And during that time the stretcher-bearers either doped or terrified Miss
  Sanders to silence and she was put on the stretcher instead of the girl. Did
  you hear a shriek?"</p>

  <p>The woman nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, just as I got to the foot of the stairs. I thought it was Mrs.
  Dennsey."</p>

  <p>Betcher Long was white to the lips.</p>

  <p>"I see," he said simply. "I can't very well blame you. I should have
  anticipated something like this happening when I heard of this patient who
  had been brought here during the afternoon. Her room was next door, of
  course?"</p>

  <p>There was nothing for him to do but to make the usual notification to
  Scotland Yard, warn all stations to seek information of the motor-ambulance,
  the number of which had been taken by the officer on guard outside the
  nursing home.</p>

  <p>He had forgotten all about his father, until, at three o'clock in the
  morning, when he was receiving reports at Scotland Yard, the valet telephoned
  him.</p>

  <p>"Sir Godley has not returned yet, sir," he said, and Betcher Long turned
  cold.</p>

  <p>He had need now of all his courage and resolution. He sat back in his
  chair, and, with a tremendous effort of will, swept all sentiment from his
  mind. He was a detective officer engaged in tracing the disappearance of a
  man named Godley Long and the secretary of Miss Revelstoke. If he thought of
  them in any other way, he would go mad.</p>

  <p>And these were not the only two people who had disappeared that night.
  Miss Revelstoke had gone out early in the evening to a party and up to three
  o'clock she was still away. Henry, the lawyer, also was absent; apparently,
  he had accompanied Miss Revelstoke. But one man was at his post. At four
  o'clock in the morning, in answer to a 'phone call, Mr. Cravel spoke.</p>

  <p>"Long, is it? Anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"I've been calling you since midnight," said Betcher Long. "Where have you
  been?"</p>

  <p>"Calling me since midnight, have you? That's a lie! I've been asleep since
  eleven, and the 'phone is by the side of my bed. What do you want?"</p>

  <p>It was not the voice of a man who had been aroused from sleep; it was
  clear, virile, very wakeful.</p>

  <p>"I'm coming along to see you," said the detective. "Is your sister
  there?"</p>

  <p>There was a pause.</p>

  <p>"No, my sister isn't here. She's in town. You know her flat?" He gave the
  number.</p>

  <p>"I'll be down in an hour," said Long.</p>

  <p>He had already called the girl, but could extract no information from her,
  and when he sent an officer to bring her to Scotland Yard, he found that she
  had gone out a few minutes before the detective's arrival.</p>

  <p>Day was breaking bleakly and a gentle rain was falling as the police car
  roared along the Great West Road, on its way to Berkshire. As they passed the
  empty house to which the girl had been carried, Betcher was half inclined to
  stop the machine and conduct a search; but common sense told him that,
  wherever else in the world the Terrible People had taken Nora, it would not
  be there. Cravel knew, and Cravel should tell. That was the thought uppermost
  in his mind. Before he had left Scotland Yard he had got into touch with one
  of his superiors and the wise old police chief had uttered only one note of
  warning.</p>

  <p>"Go easy on that third-degree business, Betcher," he said. "Get any
  information you can, but use legal means."</p>

  <p>"All means are legal to me, Colonel. But I'll make a memorandum that you
  have warned me."</p>

  <p>This, then, was the great stroke that had been planned almost at a
  minute's notice. They had secured Monkford's money through the girl, and now
  they were to find a means whereby the money could be safely transferred to
  them. She was to be married to one member, and once that was accomplished, in
  conditions which made it impossible for Nora Sanders to bring a charge, they
  hoped to present him with an accomplished fact and dare him to risk the ugly
  consequences which would follow exposure.</p>

  <p>He was clear of Egham, dipping steeply down the hill toward the Ascot
  road, and Sergeant Rouch dozing by his side, when he saw a figure standing by
  the side of the road. It was a woman, and she was signalling him to stop. He
  jammed on his brakes, the car slithered and skidded ominously, but came to a
  standstill within a yard of where the girl was waiting. Before he came up to
  her, he saw it was Alice Cravel, and a little car that lay on its side in the
  ditch explained her presence.</p>

  <p>"I thought it was you," she said breathlessly. "Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>"To Heartsease to see your brother."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, don't!" Her hands were clasped in supplication. "Don't
  go, Mr. Long! I tried to get there before you, but my brakes jammed coming
  down the hill. You're not going&mdash;promise me you won't!"</p>

  <p>She was a pitiful object; there could have been hardly a dry stitch on
  her, for the rain was pelting down by now and she had not even troubled to
  lift the hood of her car.</p>

  <p>"What are you afraid of? What is he going to do? You know Nora was taken
  last night?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I knew&mdash;I warned you. But don't make matters worse. It is death for
  you to go to Heartsease, Mr. Long. I never dreamt that I should ever try to
  save your life, but I am doing it!"</p>

  <p>"Where have they taken her?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;honestly, I don't know. If I knew, I probably should
  not tell you&mdash;but I don't."</p>

  <p>He looked at the wrecked car, and from the car to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Get in here; I'll take you the rest of the trip."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Take me as far as Sunningdale; I can hire a car there," she said.</p>

  <p>"You're not coming on to Heartsease?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Rouch scrambled to the back of the car, and she took his place.</p>

  <p>Betcher felt her shivering with the cold and, taking a rug from the back
  seat, he put it about her, she submitting meekly.</p>

  <p>"Do you know my father has gone also?"</p>

  <p>"Your father? Oh, Sir Godley Long, isn't it? Where has he gone?"</p>

  <p>Evidently she did not regard Sir Godley's disappearance as an act of the
  Terrible People, for she seemed scarcely interested.</p>

  <p>"I'm getting weak, horribly weak," she said. "I think it must be Jackie's
  death that was responsible. Poor Jackie!"</p>

  <p>Tears rolled down her pale face, and he heard her sob, and was just as
  embarrassed as the average man would be in the presence of a weeping
  woman.</p>

  <p>Beyond the level crossing at Sunningdale he stopped the car at her request
  before a garage which showed no sign of life.</p>

  <p>"You'll never get a car here."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will," she insisted. "There's a caretaker on the premises."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>"Back to London," she replied. "I've done my best&mdash;I've done my poor
  best!"</p>

  <p>She held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Mr. Long. I ought not to wish you well out of this, but I do.
  And if there is another world, as some people think, and you're conscious
  after life of all that is past, you will remember that I tried."</p>

  <p>She turned away, her voice broken, and he stared after her as she went
  rapidly down the little road by the side of the garage toward a door which
  she evidently knew gave entrance to the night watchman's quarters.</p>

  <p>He continued on the road with a queer little fear at his heart&mdash;a
  fear that had been a stranger to him hitherto. She was so sure that death
  awaited him at Heartsease that she had almost communicated her faith to
  him.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch37"
     name="ch37"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

  <p class="first">TEN minutes' drive brought them to the big gates of
  Heartsease Park, and as he passed up the twisted drive, Betcher was oppressed
  by an unusual sense of danger. Anything less sinister than Mr. Cravel could
  not be imagined. He was waiting under the porch for Betcher Long's arrival,
  and though the hour was early he was dressed with scrupulous care, and, the
  detective observed, shaven.</p>

  <p>"Did you see my sister by any chance, Mr. Long?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," said Betcher, and Cravel laughed.</p>

  <p>"She telephoned me five minutes ago from Sunningdale and said you had
  given her a lift to the garage."</p>

  <p>"In that case," replied Betcher coolly, "I must have seen her."</p>

  <p>In the hall on a little tray was a steaming pot of coffee.</p>

  <p>"I thought you would like a drink after your cold ride," said Cravel. "I
  can assure you that it is not poisoned or doped."</p>

  <p>Then, as he still seemed undecided:</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you would like to try it on Mr. Rouch first?"</p>

  <p>The coffee was welcome, and Betcher Long drank a cupful gratefully.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you brought Sergeant Rouch with you," said Cravel, apropos of
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>Cravel shrugged his square shoulders.</p>

  <p>"When one is suspected of all sorts of terrible crimes, one likes to have
  a witness, even a hostile witness," he said "I've had a fire put in No. 7.
  That is Monkford's old suite. You're not nervous?"</p>

  <p>"Why there?" asked Betcher steadily.</p>

  <p>Again the manager shrugged.</p>

  <p>"I don't imagine that you have come down here at five o'clock in the
  morning to book a room for next year," he said drily. "In fact, I expect
  rather an unpleasant interview, and, having some self-respect, I prefer that
  our conversation should be more or less private."</p>

  <p>The elevator was not working, and they climbed the two flights of stairs,
  and Cravel stood aside to allow the detectives to pass into the familiar
  sitting room.</p>

  <p>A wood fire was burning on the hearth, and Betcher stripped off his coat.
  He looked at Rouch thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"On the whole, I think you had better stay downstairs, Sergeant," he
  said.</p>

  <p>The obedient Rouch went out of the room.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I am rather short of servants," said Cravel. "I only keep
  enough staff to run the hotel during the winter, but if there is anything you
  want while you're staying here, I shall be happy to get it."</p>

  <p>Evidently Cravel had carried out his intention of converting the suite
  into a stair-head. When he had driven up to the hotel, Betcher had noticed
  the presence of a builder. A new wall was being built out from the main
  front, and he gathered, from the general untidiness of the saloon, that the
  builders had already started to convert the suite.</p>

  <p>"Now, Cravel, I want a few words of explanation from you, and I'm warning
  you that you're very nearly at the end of your tether&mdash;where is Miss
  Sanders?"</p>

  <p>Cravel smiled.</p>

  <p>"Why should you imagine that I know?" he asked. "I have been in this place
  for the greater part of a week and haven't stirred out. The last news I had,
  which was from Miss Revelstoke, was to the effect that Nora Sanders had been
  carried off by some person or persons unknown, and had been most heroically
  saved by that prince of detectives, Betcher Long!"</p>

  <p>"She was taken away from a nursing home last night," said Betcher, "your
  friend the Professor being responsible&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My friend the Professor? And who on earth is my friend the
  Professor?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to argue with you; I'm going to find Nora Sanders, and
  you're going to tell me where she is."</p>

  <p>They faced one another, and in Betcher Long's eyes was a light which
  Cravel had seen once before. Yet he did not flinch; the hard lips were still
  curved in a smile.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you are a little distraught, Mr. Long," he said quietly, "and until
  you are calmer, I am afraid it is useless to talk to you, especially as the
  only information I can give you will come as a terrible shock to you."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" said Betcher softly. "What is the nature of the shock?"</p>

  <p>Cravel walked over to the fire and stood with his back to it, his hands
  behind him.</p>

  <p>"A most unfortunate thing has happened," he said slowly, "and I'm going to
  confess to you that I know a little&mdash;a very little&mdash;about this
  affair. Miss Sanders is by way of being a friend of mine&mdash;you probably
  didn't know that, but I have had a number of letters from her, and she has
  honoured me with her confidence. It appears that she was rather distressed by
  the marked attentions which you have shown to her."</p>

  <p>Betcher nodded. The man was talking to gain time. He was also speaking
  with a purpose.</p>

  <p>"Naturally, you would not imagine that your attentions would distress any
  woman, and I am not blaming you for that. It is consonant with human
  vanity&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're talking more and more like Clay Shelton," interrupted Betcher.
  "That kind of shadow philosophy and half-digested logic was a specialty of
  his."</p>

  <p>A red flush crept to the man's face for a second, his eyes blazed, and
  Betcher could hear his deep breathing. And then:</p>

  <p>"I am not concerned with the philosophy of Clay Shelton, whoever he may
  be," he said evenly. "I am merely advancing the view that you naturally would
  not dream that your attentions would be disagreeable to anybody. Miss Sanders
  did not like to hurt your feelings. Your attentions were so insistent,
  however, that she became alarmed, and she asked a friend of mine to help her
  escape from your rather embarrassing vigilance. I do not know the exact
  details of the case, but I understand that my friend succeeded in rescuing
  her last night. Unfortunately..."</p>

  <p>He paused here, and Betcher waited, his eyes on the man's face.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, the shock of her terrible experience a few days ago proved
  too much for poor Nora, and on her way to Heartsease "</p>

  <p>"Is she here?" Betcher asked quickly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cravel nodded.</p>

  <p>"On her way to Heartsease she collapsed, and in spite of all the
  assistance which could be rendered by the doctor in town&mdash;died."</p>

  <p>"Dead?" Betcher Long's eyes were half closed. "You're a liar, Cravel!
  You're trying to rattle me. You can try again! And if she is dead"&mdash;the
  gun in his hand did not so much as shake&mdash;"if she is dead, I'm going to
  carry out my promise, and nothing can save you."</p>

  <p>Again the man shrugged.</p>

  <p>"It is a lamentable fact," he said. "I thought you knew. My sister is not
  usually so reticent."</p>

  <p>"She knew?" asked Betcher softly.</p>

  <p>Cravel nodded.</p>

  <p>"Where is Nora Sanders?"</p>

  <p>To his amazement, the man waved his hand in the direction of the door
  leading into the room where Monkford had met his death.</p>

  <p>"We put her there," he said. "Your friend the Professor is with her. What
  a clever fellow you are!" he went on, with heavy jocularity. "To come
  straight to this place! You must have a lover's instinct!"</p>

  <p>"Walk!" said Betcher curtly, his gun pointing to the man's waist, and his
  other hand to the door. "We'll see how far your joke carries," he said, "and
  I have an idea it will be a poor joke for you, my friend."</p>

  <p>The man strolled leisurely up the room to the door communicating with the
  bedroom, turned the handle, and threw it wide open.</p>

  <p>"Go in!" said Betcher, and followed slowly, all his senses alert.</p>

  <p>The curtains of the bedroom had been half drawn. The gray light that
  streamed through the narrow space between gave the apartment an eerie,
  unearthly look. But of this he was not conscious. He stood, paralyzed with
  amazement, in the open doorway.</p>

  <p>Facing him was a bed pulled up level with the wall, and on the bed, her
  face white as milk, her lips colourless and her eyes closed, was Nora
  Sanders! He could only stare open-mouthed, his brain for a while refusing to
  function.</p>

  <p>It was true, then; she was dead. Why else had they brought him here?</p>

  <p>A movement at the foot of the bed, and he saw in the shadow of an alcove a
  queer, unfamiliar shape&mdash;an old man, his untidy white hair falling about
  his cheeks. The light glinted on his big spectacles. He was glaring at
  Betcher with a grin of hate.</p>

  <p>"Don't move, anybody! Stand over there, Cravel. If either of you pull a
  gun I'll shoot!"</p>

  <p>His eyes came back to the still figure on the bed. Dead! It was impossible
  to believe. Then, through the frozen surface of his sorrow bubbled the hot
  rage within him.</p>

  <p>"You swine!" he hissed.</p>

  <p>He took a stride forward; his second step brought him to the centre of the
  carpet by the bed. He felt it yield under him, and strove to fling himself
  back. But he was too late; the balance had shifted before he could recover.
  He flung out his hand to reach the edge of the great hole in the floor which
  the carpet had hidden, missed it, and fell. His head struck violently against
  a scaffold pole and he knew no more.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch38"
     name="ch38"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">A FEW minutes later Mr. Cravel walked leisurely down the
  stairs out to the porch where Rouch was standing, gazing dismally at the
  falling rain.</p>

  <p>"Inspector Long is staying to breakfast," he said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, is he?" said Sergeant Rouch, in his most unfriendly tone. "Does he
  want me to go up?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet. He has asked for certain documents which he is examining, and in
  which, I presume, he expects to find some evidence of my criminal mind."</p>

  <p>"Oh, does he?" Sergeant Rouch permitted himself to ask coldly.</p>

  <p>Cravel unlocked the door of his office and went in, and presently Rouch
  heard him come out and the snap of the key turning. He did not trouble to
  look behind him, and that was his undoing.</p>

  <p>The blow that Cravel struck would have killed an ordinary man, but the
  sergeant wore a thick derby hat. Under the impact of the blow he stumbled on
  to his knees. The truncheon rose and fell again. Cravel stooped and, grasping
  the man under the arms, dragged him out to where Betcher's motor car was
  standing, and, hoisting him into the tonneau, threw the rug over him. From
  his office he wheeled a light motor-cycle, and this he strapped leisurely to
  the side of the car, resting the wheels on the running board. This done, he
  got up to the driver's seat and sent the machine down the drive.</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour later the car passed through Egham, turned abruptly
  into the Runnymede Meadows, and followed the Windsor road, which runs
  parallel with the river. At a point where the bank drops steeply to the water
  he got out, leaving the engines running, and detached his motor-cycle.
  Turning the wheel, he threw in the gear and the car jerked forward, wobbled
  up a little rise, then down a steep slope, and plunging into the river,
  turned turtle.</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch; it was now half-past five, and, mounting the
  motor-cycle, he went back to Heartsease.</p>

  <p>The girl and the old man were gone when he entered the room, and, looking
  round, he saw the pistol which the detective had dropped. It was still lying
  where it had fallen at the edge of the pit. Slipping the Browning into his
  pocket, he rolled up the carpet, removing it to the saloon. The bed had
  already been dismantled of sheets and coverings, and with a final glance
  round he locked the door of the untidy room and went downstairs.</p>

  <p>There was work for him to do. From his office there was a narrow flight of
  stairs that led down to a cellar, from which the wine had been removed only a
  few days before. With a lamp in one hand and his truncheon in the other, he
  descended the stairs and walked along the brick floor until he came to a
  place immediately beneath a square hole that had been cut in the vaulted roof
  by the builders. Had he looked up, he could have seen through the scaffold
  pole the gap through which Betcher Long had fallen. But he had come upon
  another errand, and he caught his breath as, flashing the lamp to and fro, he
  failed to discover the man whom he thought to find dead or dying on the brick
  floor.</p>

  <p>Betcher Long was gone! There was no evidence that he had ever been here;
  no sign of blood. He uttered an imprecation under his breath. It was
  impossible that the detective could have escaped serious injury. Perhaps the
  others had moved him. Again he searched the cellar, opening an interior room
  and examining it, too.</p>

  <p>Betcher Long, alive, maddened by the sight he had seen... ? Never before
  in his life had this hard-faced man felt the twinge of fear, but he was
  terrified now. He locked the door of his office the moment he reached ground
  level, and, pouring out a stiff dose of brandy, drank it in one gulp. There
  was a knock at the door; it was the early-duty cook, who had been to Cravel's
  room for the keys of the kitchen.</p>

  <p>The old woman was deaf and was the only servant that had slept at
  Heartsease that night, for it was mid-week, and there were no guests in the
  hotel. He unlocked the door, handed the kitchen keys to her, though this was
  not necessary, for he had made the coffee that morning and had left the
  kitchen door open, as she came back to explain in some alarm.</p>

  <p>He went up the stairs to the second floor, and walked to the far end of
  the passage, and put a key into what appeared to be a part of a solid wall.
  It was a door of steel, and beyond this was a suite which did not appear in
  the list of apartments available for guests. This consisted of two rooms, a
  tiny bathroom, and a kitchenette, and was Cravel's winter quarters when the
  hotel was closed. He fastened the steel door and went into the smaller of the
  two rooms. A girl was lying on the bed, perfectly motionless and apparently
  lifeless, save for the slight rise and fall of her breast, which only a keen
  eye would detect.</p>

  <p>He lifted the bare arm and examined the three punctures, one of which was
  recent. On the table by the bedside was a small green bottle and an open
  hypodermic case. Raising an eyelid with his fingertip, he saw that she did
  not flinch, or show the slightest sensibility to light, and, with a grunt of
  satisfaction, he went to the other room.</p>

  <p>This was empty. On the table was a note scribbled in pencil, which he
  read, and, having read, burnt in the open fireplace.</p>

  <p>Where was Betcher Long? That was the absorbing problem. There was no
  reference to him in the note. He took the detective's pistol from his pocket,
  examined it curiously, and laid it on the table behind him&mdash;the very
  appearance of the gun deepened his anxiety. For a long time he sat on the
  edge of the table, a cigarette between his lips, his arms folded, gazing
  moodily out of the window, which showed the angle of a wall and a clear view
  across the golf links. Supposing Betcher was dead somewhere and had been
  removed after the note had been written? The search for him would not begin
  until later in the morning. The car would be found in the river, and the body
  of Rouch would lead to dragging. That would take time.</p>

  <p>He wondered what had happened to Alice. Why had she gone back to her flat
  instead of coming on and taking her part in that crisis? Alice puzzled him.
  She had been as hard and as remorseless as any, had taken all risks and
  feared nothing, and now she had weakened at a moment when she would have been
  so helpful.</p>

  <p>A voice called him from below. He opened the door quickly and ran to the
  balustrade overlooking the hall.</p>

  <p>It was his sister; the soddened clothing hung to her figure; the face, wet
  with rain, was looking up at him. "Come down," she said, and he obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Where have you been&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted him with an impatient gesture. "Where is Long?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know; he got away."</p>

  <p>She did not believe him&mdash;the very fact that she refrained from
  putting any further question was proof of it.</p>

  <p>"I've been on the Sunningdale road," she said, "and I found
  something&mdash;a taxi-driver!"</p>

  <p>Cravel frowned at this.</p>

  <p>"Don't be more mysterious than you can help," he growled. "What has a
  taxi-driver to do with me?"</p>

  <p>"A lot, I think," she answered. "He was standing at the end of the lane
  that runs along the park boundary, and he seemed fairly pleased with himself.
  I saw his cab parked under the elms, and he said he had been there since soon
  after midnight. He drove somebody here."</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"That is what I wanted to know. I 'freshed' him, but he wouldn't tell me.
  A gray-haired man who picked him up at the corner of Berkeley
  Square&mdash;that was all he would tell me, though I have an idea that he
  could have told me more. Sonny, there is somebody in this
  house&mdash;somebody you know nothing about."</p>

  <p>He blinked rapidly in his perturbation.</p>

  <p>"Fiddlesticks!" he snapped. "There is nobody here except&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She rightly understood his hesitation.</p>

  <p>"She is here, then? You're playing with fire&mdash;and not ordinary fire
  either!" she said intensely. "Sonny, get out of it while you can. You may be
  too late in an hour's time. The going isn't any too good, but there is at
  least a chance. Won't you take it?"</p>

  <p>A smile dawned on his harsh face.</p>

  <p>"When everything we want is in our hands?" he asked contemptuously. "Am I
  a fool? No, we've gone too far. There is only one thing to do now, and that
  is to stick it out."</p>

  <p>She was looking at him thoughtfully; he had the feeling that she was not
  especially interested in his fate any longer and that she would presently
  change the subject in her abrupt way to something which touched her more
  nearly. Here he was right.</p>

  <p>"I'm wet through&mdash;I think I will change," she said.</p>

  <p>Her apartment was immediately under that of her brother, and resembled it
  in all particulars, except that there was no mystery about the door.</p>

  <p>He waited for her, pacing up and down the tiled floor of the lounge, until
  she came down again. Then he saw, to his surprise, that, over her dry
  clothes, she wore a rubber coat.</p>

  <p>"You're not going out again, are you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I told the garage man I was returning. They are bringing in my car,
  and the garage is useful. It is on the main road, it has a telephone. I
  expect to be there all morning."</p>

  <p>He smiled again.</p>

  <p>"What else do you expect?"</p>

  <p>"Trouble," she said in a low voice, "bad, bad trouble. Have they
  gone&mdash;the other people?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"You've lost your nerve, kid. Jackie, I suppose? It was an
  accident&mdash;he shot himself in the struggle, the poor fool." Then, as he
  saw the blank face, "I'll swear to it, Alice! He was dead when we pulled him
  out of the water the second time. The hanging was ghastly, but you
  know&mdash;the Professor never forgave Jackie for the Colchester business.
  Hated him&mdash;poor devil."</p>

  <p>He waited, his hands flung wide in protest, but she was not convinced; no
  more now than when he had first told the story.</p>

  <p>"An automatic killed him," she said briefly. "Jackie had only an old
  service revolver; the newspapers were very certain about the Browning bullet,
  but we won't go into that."</p>

  <p>She walked to the door and glanced left and right. The rain was teeming
  down, but she was not inspecting the weather.</p>

  <p>"If he is not in the house, he is in the grounds. I should search, if I
  were you&mdash;no, I shouldn't! I should bolt!"</p>

  <p>"You're not me," he said tritely.</p>

  <p>She had come to the house on a bicycle, one she had borrowed at the
  garage. He watched her till she had passed out of sight; then, going up to
  his room, he took up Betcher's pistol, thrust it into the pocket of the
  raincoat he donned, and, with one glance at the drugged girl, he closed and
  locked the door and went out to search the grounds.</p>

  <p>First he made a careful scrutiny of the immediate neighbourhood of the
  hotel and found nothing.</p>

  <p>Part of the lawn facing the portico had been dug up to divert the electric
  cable that supplied the house. Here, on the soft loam, he found the trace of
  a footstep&mdash;a big, square-toed foot and the impress of a rubber
  heel.</p>

  <p>At the sight of this, his interest in the girl's theory quickened.
  Presently he found two more footprints in a patch of the lawn where the grass
  had worn thin. They came from the direction of the drive.</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette with difficulty and stood for a while debating the
  problem.</p>

  <p>Who was the man who had come in the cab and what was his object? There was
  a short cut to the boundary lane and, acting on an impulse, he crossed the
  lawn and, following the path which led through a clump of laurels, he came to
  a wicket gate which opened on to the lane.</p>

  <p>Drawing back the heavy bolts, he went out into the narrow lane and looked
  up and down. Presently he saw the cab, and, sitting on the running board,
  smoking philosophically, the driver.</p>

  <p>The man turned quickly and half rose at the sound of footsteps, then sank
  down again.</p>

  <p>"Thought you were my fare," he said. "I hope he won't be long. I've got to
  turn this cab over to my day man at eight o'clock."</p>

  <p>He explained that the cab was his own property and that he employed
  another man to drive it by day.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid your fare will be a long time," said Cravel. "Won't you bring
  your cab into the hotel grounds?"</p>

  <p>But here the man was immovable.</p>

  <p>"He told me to wait here, and here I'm waiting," he said. "If I miss him,
  I miss a teener."</p>

  <p>He looked curiously at the other, and Cravel frankly introduced
  himself.</p>

  <p>"I can't quite understand who is your fare," he said, and strove to secure
  a little more information. But here he was unsuccessful. The description
  given by the taxi-man was unfamiliar to the manager. Then the garrulous
  driver said something which made Cravel jump.</p>

  <p>"I hope he's not going to bilk me," he said. "I don't like these jobs of
  following cars, though I kept up with the Fiat all the way down, and it was a
  'six,' too!"</p>

  <p>Fiat!</p>

  <p>That was the car which had brought the Professor and his companion.</p>

  <p>"What time did you pick him up?"</p>

  <p>The cabman told him. He knew, also, the minute he and the car he chased
  had arrived at Heartsease. Cravel drew a deep breath. They had been shadowed!
  This possibility had not occurred to him.</p>

  <p>The danger was now apparent, and his sister's warning rang in his ears as
  he retraced his steps to the grounds.</p>

  <p>He was nearing the place where the hole had been dug in the lawn when he
  saw something shining on the grass and, stooping, picked it up. It was a pair
  of pince-nez horn-rimmed reading glasses. Though they were drenched with
  rain, he guessed that they had not been there for very long.</p>

  <p>He examined the glasses carefully&mdash;somehow, they fitted the picture
  which the cab-driver had drawn of his fare. He went straight into his little
  office and, shutting the door, descended to the cellar. Supposing the unknown
  had rescued the detective, there would be muddy marks on the floor, but for
  these he looked in vain. Baffled, he came out and went upstairs to his room.
  He was walking along the short landing that divided the two stairs when he
  stopped dead. On the red carpet, plain to see, was a muddy footprint that had
  not been there when he went out!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch39"
     name="ch39"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>

  <p class="first">HIS head bent forward, his heavy jaw outthrust, he turned
  slowly. There was no sound, no evidence of the intruder. Bending down, he
  felt the print. The mud was still wet. In a panic, he flew up the stairs and
  did not stop until he had reached his apartment, outside of which a tray
  rested on the floor&mdash;his breakfast brought here in his absence.</p>

  <p>His first thought was of the girl. She was lying just as he had left her;
  her eyes were closed, she was very still, but the colour was beginning to
  flow back to her face.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>He mopped his streaming forehead, thrust his handkerchief down between his
  collar and throat. Going out, he brought the tray to the sitting room and
  drank a hot cup of tea with relish.</p>

  <p>It was the old cook's footprint he had seen, of course. Who else? He
  wished now that Alice had not told him of the cab&mdash;almost wished that he
  had refrained from questioning the driver. In his present state of mind, he
  would almost have welcomed the ability to deceive himself.</p>

  <p>He scoffed at his own weakness. He, the most terrible of the Terrible
  People, was afraid! Walking to the window, he threw it wide open. The chill
  of the rain-washed air was a diversion. He had reached the point where he
  could be glad of physical discomfort, so long as it carried his mind away
  from the crouching fear that seemed ready to spring upon reason and overwhelm
  it.</p>

  <p>Slipping off his raincoat, he put the pistol ready to hand on the table
  and gave himself up to thought, and unpleasant thought it was.</p>

  <p>Suppose Betcher Long were alive? Suppose the trailing shadow that had
  followed the Professor were at this moment in the hotel? Suppose&mdash;</p>

  <p>Then he heard a sound which made him leap from the table&mdash;the sound
  of a key turning in the door. Quick as lightning, he faced about.</p>

  <p>"Don't move, or I will kill you!"</p>

  <p>He could only glare at the amazing apparition that met his eyes; for a
  second, he was incapable of speech or movement.</p>

  <p>Here was a danger and a menace that in his wildest speculations had never
  occurred to him.</p>

  <p>It was Nora Sanders.</p>

  <p>Behind her he saw the length of the corridor, for the communicating door
  was wide open&mdash;it was the sound of the turning key that had aroused
  him.</p>

  <p>"Don't move!"</p>

  <p>He was looking into the muzzle of a Browning pistol held in a hand that
  did not tremble.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch40"
     name="ch40"></a>CHAPTER XL</h2>

  <p class="first">CRAVEL could only gape at the unexpected vision. Nora's face
  was white; she was clad only in her nightgown, but the hand that held the
  pistol was marvellously steady. It was Betcher Long's pistol&mdash;she must
  have taken it from the table behind him.</p>

  <p>"Don't move, please!"</p>

  <p>She opened the door wider. Beyond was the corridor, and at the end the
  stairs, and safety. He heard the voice of his own waiter in the vestibule
  below. She had but to reach the foot of the stairs... He must temporize now
  for his very life's sake.</p>

  <p>"Miss Sanders," be stammered, "you&mdash;you don't know what you're doing.
  You've been very ill."</p>

  <p>"I know well what I'm doing," she said steadily, and yet her voice was
  curiously weak.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she was more conscious of this than he. It seemed as though some
  other person were talking&mdash;she was listening to that sound of a strange
  voice.</p>

  <p>"You'll catch your death of cold if you're not careful. Let me get you a
  coat."</p>

  <p>He lifted one from the hook in the tiny hall and held it toward her, but
  she retreated into the passage as he advanced, her gun levelled.</p>

  <p>"Go upstairs," he whispered urgently. "There is a fire in No. 6. Here is
  the key."</p>

  <p>He threw it down at her feet.</p>

  <p>"I won't touch you&mdash;I swear I won't touch you!"</p>

  <p>He picked up the coat, and then, as she hesitated, he flung it over her
  pistol arm. In another second, he had strangled the scream in her throat. She
  struggled feebly, for she was still under the effect of the drug, but he
  dragged her back, closing the door with his foot, and flung her on the
  bed.</p>

  <p>"If you keep quiet I'll not hurt you. If you scream, by God! I'll kill
  you!" he whispered fiercely.</p>

  <p>She stared up over the big hand that covered her mouth. She was helpless
  now, and her eyes spoke her despair.</p>

  <p>With one hand he picked up the hypodermic; it was still half filled with
  its pale green fluid. Keeping the other hand over her mouth, he jabbed the
  needle into the white arm and pressed home the plunger. She tried to struggle
  from his grasp, but she was powerless, and presently she lay still, and when
  he closed her eyes they did not open.</p>

  <p>Cravel was ashen with fear. The girl must be moved at once. He looked at
  his watch; it was too early to get the people he wanted, but as soon as it
  was possible, she must be moved from Heartsease. He tidied himself to remove
  the evidence of the struggle, changed his collar, which she had wrenched from
  his throat, and went out, locking the door behind him.</p>

  <p>The drug would keep her under for an hour, and in the meantime, he must
  get rid of the few servants who were in the hotel. As to the strange man
  whose footprint he had seen, he must dismiss him as a factor, otherwise the
  fear of him would lead to madness.</p>

  <p>The cook did not matter; she was deaf, and, moreover, would keep to her
  kitchen now that his breakfast had been served. The one waiter he disposed of
  readily, sending him to London on a fictitious errand. In the off-season the
  garage man acted as "boots" and assisted generally in keeping the hotel
  clean, and he, with the restaurant waiter and the cook's assistant, comprised
  the staff. He must take the risk of acting suspiciously. He sent the garage
  man to the main gate to intercept the waiters when they arrived and tell them
  their services would not be required that day.</p>

  <p>All this took time. He concluded his arrangements and went into his office
  and called a number. To his relief, a familiar voice answered him, and for
  five minutes he spoke in Danish.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to get her away, that's all," he said in conclusion. "I don't
  care how&mdash;no, no, I don't know what has happened to him. I searched the
  cellar but there was nobody there. Send Billy down as soon as you possibly
  can. If we can get through to-day we are safe."</p>

  <p>He hung up the receiver and went back to his suite; he had told nothing of
  the square-toed shadow. That would take too long in the telling.</p>

  <p>The girl's door was closed, as he had left it, and he sat down to find yet
  another explanation for the disappearance of Betcher Long.</p>

  <p>It was impossible that he could have escaped. He had fallen three floors,
  and if that had not killed, it would certainly have crippled him. How slowly
  the time passed! It seemed that when he took out his watch it had
  stopped.</p>

  <p>He recalled his talk with Betcher, striving to remember every second. Sir
  Godley had disappeared, he recollected, but of Sir Godley he knew nothing,
  except that he was Betcher Long's father, and that a scheme had been
  discussed by the Professor for bleeding the banker. It was not strange that
  he did not associate Sir Godley with the footprints.</p>

  <p>He could not afford to stay here, he realized. Somebody must be downstairs
  to meet the postman when he came. At all costs, he must behave normally.</p>

  <p>He looked in at the girl; she was lying still. But she had been lying
  still before and had deceived him. To make absolutely certain, he used the
  needle again, and, satisfied, went downstairs to await developments. And they
  came swiftly.</p>

  <p>As he strolled out to the open he saw a big car sweeping up the drive. It
  came to a halt before the portico and three men got out.</p>

  <p>"I am Inspector Claves of the Berkshire Constabulary," said the oldest of
  the three. "On a complaint laid this morning, and at the request of Scotland
  Yard, a warrant has been issued to search the hotel."</p>

  <p>He produced the document; it was signed by a local justice of the peace,
  but Cravel stood petrified, uncomprehending.</p>

  <p>"To search the hotel?" he croaked. "What&mdash;what is the
  meaning&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what it is all about, Mr. Cravel," said the inspector, "but
  I have my duty to perform, and I hope you are not going to obstruct me in its
  execution."</p>

  <p>Cravel could only shake his head dumbly, conscious that the other two men
  had ranged themselves on either side of him.</p>

  <p>"You have no guests in the hotel?"</p>

  <p>"None." Cravel's voice was cracked; he could scarcely recognize it
  himself. They were going to search the hotel, and upstairs was the
  girl...</p>

  <p>They passed from room to room and presently ascended to the first floor.
  The suite which Miss Revelstoke had occupied yielded nothing. The next room
  in the corridor was locked.</p>

  <p>"Have you the key of this?"</p>

  <p>"I have a pass-key in my office."</p>

  <p>"Go and fetch it," said the officer briefly, and Cravel went down,
  accompanied by one of the men, and searched his desk. But the pass-key, which
  was kept in one of the smaller drawers of the desk, was not to be found. He
  found, however, in the reception office, the actual key of No. 3, and this he
  took back.</p>

  <p>His mind was in a whirl; it was impossible for him to think consecutively
  or logically. All that he knew was that, by some horrible mischance, the
  clever plans of the Terrible People had been brought to failure; that
  disaster slowly and surely was overtaking them.</p>

  <p>Why were the police searching the hotel? On whose information, he wondered
  dully, as the inspector opened the door of No. 3? Here was a chaos of
  scaffolding and builders' material; a great square hole had been cut in the
  floor. Cravel caught only a glimpse of this, for the inspector slipped into
  the room and, after a while, came out and closed the door.</p>

  <p>"What is this?"</p>

  <p>"It&mdash;it is the new elevator that I am putting in," stammered the man.
  "That is why I kept the door locked, in case some of the servants fell
  through. There is a hole in the floor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He made some incoherent statement about the alterations and their cost,
  and the party moved on to the next room and finally mounted the stairs to the
  second floor. Cravel followed numbly. Perhaps they would not notice the door
  in the wall? It was a dull morning, and the wall had a solid look.</p>

  <p>His heart sank as the inspector went straight to the hidden door of the
  suite. He found his voice now:</p>

  <p>"You can't go in there," he said.</p>

  <p>He found a difficulty in speaking; was conscious that his agitation was
  patent to all beholders.</p>

  <p>"I've&mdash;I've got a friend&mdash;he is sick."</p>

  <p>"Give me the key."</p>

  <p>"I tell you I have a friend who is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The grip tightened on his arm.</p>

  <p>"Come, come, Mr. Cravel, don't let us have any trouble. You have nothing
  to hide?"</p>

  <p>He could only shake his head, and, like a man in a dream, he passed the
  key to the big officer, who opened the door and walked into the dining room,
  which faced them.</p>

  <p>"There is another room here, isn't there?"</p>

  <p>Cravel did not answer, and the inspector tried the door of the bedroom,
  opened it slowly, and walked in. Cravel set his teeth and waited, and
  presently the police officer came out.</p>

  <p>"Nobody here," he said.</p>

  <p>He had not closed the door, and, peering past him, Cravel saw that the bed
  where he had left Nora Sanders was empty!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch41"
     name="ch41"></a>CHAPTER XLI</h2>

  <p class="first">THE remainder of the search seemed to occupy an eternity.
  The manager followed the men from room to room, hypnotized by this new shock.
  At long last they came to the lounge, and the police inspector handed him his
  keys.</p>

  <p>"This sort of search is very unpleasant for all concerned," he said, and
  he was almost respectful. "But you realize that I had no choice in the
  matter."</p>

  <p>Cravel said nothing. He saw only the empty bed; could think of no other
  matter.</p>

  <p>The officers who had accompanied the inspector had gone out to their
  car&mdash;only the chief remained.</p>

  <p>"That is all, I think, Mr. Cravel," he said politely. "I am sorry to have
  given you so much trouble. And now I'm going to bother you a little further.
  May I ask you to come with me to your suite?&mdash;I want to ask you a few
  questions."</p>

  <p>He accompanied the baffled manager, and behind the closed door:</p>

  <p>"This is a very old house, isn't it, Mr. Cravel?"</p>

  <p>The manager forced a smile. "The minds of the police seem to run on secret
  passages. Was it to discover that that you got your search warrant?"</p>

  <p>"Mine doesn't run at all, it is walking just now," replied the officer.
  "But it is a very old house?"</p>

  <p>"Goes back to Tudor days; some parts are older," said Cravel, wondering
  what was coming next.</p>

  <p>Why had the police taken their departure? Why was he being questioned now?
  "Will you tell me what brought you here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have in my mind the death of Mr. Joshua Monkford." The officer spoke
  slowly, and he fixed Cravel with a glance. "It has suddenly puzzled the
  Berkshire police as much as it has puzzled Scotland Yard, and I am wondering
  whether you would care to make any statement on the matter."</p>

  <p>"Am I under arrest?" asked Cravel quickly.</p>

  <p>The inspector shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, you're not under arrest. You are not even being detained. I am asking
  you in the most friendly way." Cravel had recovered his nerve by now.</p>

  <p>"I have been questioned before and I have given all the explanations which
  have occurred to me," he said shortly.</p>

  <p>The inspector hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Of course, if a man had anything to do with the killing&mdash;not a vital
  part, mind you, Mr. Cravel&mdash;it wouldn't be a bad idea for him to turn
  King's evidence&mdash;that is, State's evidence. A man who did that might
  escape the worst punishment."</p>

  <p>Cravel laughed. Really, there were times when the police were
  childish.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you realize that you are suggesting that a respectable property
  owner of Berkshire has been guilty of a cruel and wicked murder?" he said
  deliberately. "You have no illusions on that point, Inspector?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever," said the other.</p>

  <p>He seemed at a loss as to how he should proceed, and when he resumed, it
  was to ask seemingly pointless questions about the number of guests that were
  entertained at the hotel in the course of the year. There was some object in
  this laborious cross-examination, and for the life of him Cravel could not
  guess what it was. For a quarter of an hour he was plied with stupid
  questions which could have no bearing upon the matter which was uppermost in
  his mind, and it was only toward the end that the examination became
  vital.</p>

  <p>"I have information that Inspector Long and Detective-Sergeant Rouch came
  to this hotel this morning. What happened to them?"</p>

  <p>"They went away again," said Cravel coolly. "Mr. Long is not a good friend
  of mine and suspects me of all sorts of trickery which I should never stoop
  to perform. Apparently, the secretary of Miss Revelstoke, a very good friend
  of mine, disappeared last night from a nursing home, and because he knew," he
  cleared his throat, "that I was interested in the young lady, he came down at
  five o'clock in the morning and stayed about a quarter of an hour. I haven't
  seen him since," he added truthfully.</p>

  <p>"He drove away, did he?"</p>

  <p>"He had a car, so he didn't walk," said the other sarcastically.</p>

  <p>There was a knock, and the inspector got up and opened the door, and held
  a whispered colloquy with his subordinate.</p>

  <p>"All right, Mr. Cravel, that's about all I want to know," he said. "I'm
  going now."</p>

  <p>They went down into the hall again, and, to Cravel's unspeakable relief,
  the police car drove off with its phlegmatic passengers.</p>

  <p>Now he had time to think clearly. First Betcher Long and now the girl had
  vanished into thin air. There was danger for him, big danger. He had got to
  the place where "<i>Sauve qui peut</i>" was a good family motto.</p>

  <p>There was a little mahogany desk in his sitting room, and in the lower
  steel-lined drawer a cash box. He took this out and opened it; it was filled
  to the top with American bills, and these he laid on the table. From his
  current cash box he extracted a handful of English bank and treasury notes,
  and this done, he went into the room where he had left the girl and changed
  quickly into a tweed suit. His powerful car was garaged at the hotel, and his
  plans were already made. Week by week for three years he had ticked off the
  sailings of the liners that go out of Genoa to New York, and he had an
  American passport brought up to date.</p>

  <p>Clay Shelton's amusement had been the forging of passports, and there was
  not one member of the gang who had not the necessary documents to take him
  into safety when real danger threatened. And real danger was here.</p>

  <p>He heard a quick step in the hall, ran into the dining room, and swept the
  money into his pocket, and when the key turned in the lock and Alice Cravel
  came in, there was no evidence of the hasty departure he contemplated.</p>

  <p>"The police have been here."</p>

  <p>"I met them on the road," she said. "They stopped me and asked me a lot of
  foolish questions. They didn't say a word about Long or the girl. Where are
  they?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged.</p>

  <p>"God knows!" he said.</p>

  <p>She looked at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"They're not here?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I know, they are not here."</p>

  <p>"Where are the others? Have they taken the girl with them?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"You had better ask them," he said, and her glance was full of
  suspicion.</p>

  <p>Then slowly she began to understand.</p>

  <p>"They got away with her: I saw the ambulance on the Sunningdale Road ten
  minutes ago," she said. "I'd have stopped it, but I wasn't sure."</p>

  <p>It was his turn to be astonished.</p>

  <p>"The ambulance? Which way was it going?"</p>

  <p>"Toward London."</p>

  <p>He ran his fingers through his coarse hair, bewilderment in his face.
  Events had passed beyond his understanding.</p>

  <p>"So far as I know, she was not in the ambulance, unless they came back
  while the police were here and smuggled her away. I had thought of that
  possibility."</p>

  <p>In a few words he told her what had happened.</p>

  <p>"And Betcher Long?"</p>

  <p>He groaned.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask me about Betcher Long. I tell you we dropped him, and he ought
  to be killed, but he wasn't."</p>

  <p>"I want to see the room where he dropped," she said, and, wearily, he
  accompanied her to Monkford's suite.</p>

  <p>"There's the hole and that's where he dropped, and if that isn't enough to
  kill a man, I don't know what is. I never dreamt he'd fall for it, but the
  sight of the girl threw him off his balance."</p>

  <p>She looked down. The corners of the pit were scaffold poles; there were
  cross-supports to keep the scaffolding in place at three points.</p>

  <p>"He may have struck those," she pointed, "and been thrown into one of the
  rooms down below."</p>

  <p>"It couldn't have been on the ground floor, because the builders have
  boarded it in. If it happened at all it must have been in No. 3, and the
  police searched No. 3. Besides, he'd be knocked out. No, the thing is a
  mystery and I'm not going to attempt to solve it."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" She looked at his unusual costume.</p>

  <p>"Going to town," he said evasively. "There are one or two things I have to
  do."</p>

  <p>"You're quitting!" she nodded accusingly.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool," he said roughly. "Why should I quit?"</p>

  <p>"Who else should quit but you?" she demanded. "Who has more to lose? Who
  is deeper in the mud and blood of this rotten graft than you? What did you do
  to Rouch?"</p>

  <p>He made no answer.</p>

  <p>"You clubbed him, and you are thinking this moment that he's in the river
  under Long's car by Runnymede Meadows. He's not!"</p>

  <p>The man glared at her.</p>

  <p>"He's not?" he said in a hushed voice. "Who told you?"</p>

  <p>"He's alive, and wasn't in the car when you turned it into the river. He
  dropped out near Sunningdale level crossing; he must have recovered."</p>

  <p>A dead silence, and then:</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The garage man at Sunningdale told me when I got back there&mdash;that is
  why I have returned," she said. "Rouch went there to telephone to the
  Berkshire police. You fool, that is why they came! Why else, did you
  think?"</p>

  <p>Cravel put his hand up to his bloodless lips.</p>

  <p>He raised his eyes slowly to hers.</p>

  <p>"You've got money, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"I've enough money to last, yes," she replied.</p>

  <p>"You'd better get out of England the best way you can."</p>

  <p>"Do you know&mdash;any 'best way'?" asked the girl, her dark eyes
  regarding him gravely.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"What is the best way out for a mouse when the cat is playing with it?"
  she asked. "For that is where we are."</p>

  <p>He glanced round nervously.</p>

  <p>"You'd better get them on the 'phone and warn them."</p>

  <p>"I've already been on the 'phone in the hall," she said. "And to whom do
  you think I spoke? A police officer at the exchange. Get out of England!" she
  mocked him. "There is only one way out for you, Sonny, and that is the way
  Jackie went."</p>

  <p>He dropped his eyes before hers. Now he pretended no more.</p>

  <p>"I had to do it," he said in a low voice. "You know."</p>

  <p>"I know," she nodded, "but it is the only way out for you. Where are you
  going?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going round to get my car."</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell you how far you'll travel in your car?" she asked, her hands
  upon her hips, standing with her back from the door.</p>

  <p>"See here, what do you know?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I know there are two Berkshire policemen at each gate, and one of them is
  a motor-cyclist. There's no more chance of getting away from Heartsease than
  of getting away from hell!" she said.</p>

  <p>She left him, a broken, fearful man, and he sat at the table biting his
  nails, turning over and over the might-have-beens of yesterday, and he was so
  planning and so rejecting each plan as fast as it was made when a voice
  called him from the corridor outside, and he reeled to his feet, and,
  flinging open the door, came face to face with Betcher Long!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch42"
     name="ch42"></a>CHAPTER XLII</h2>

  <p class="first">TWO narrow strips of plaster held a small square of lint on
  his forehead, but beyond that and the discolouration he could see extending
  past the dressing, he bore no marks of a fall. In manner and flippancy it was
  the old Betcher Long.</p>

  <p>"Talking about bodies," he said, "you're the worst morgue keeper ever! Had
  a talk with my Berkshire rival, didn't you&mdash;Inspector Thingummy from
  Windsor? A good fellow, but short on ideas. How does that King's evidence
  scheme strike you?"</p>

  <p>The man recovered his speech at last.</p>

  <p>"Where did you come from&mdash;!</p>

  <p>"'Baby dear," completed Betcher. "'Oust of the everywhere into here!' And
  if you want to know where the 'everywhere' is, I'll tell you. It is in No. 3.
  And maybe I'd have died there, but the goodest of all the good Samaritans
  happened to be on the spot."</p>

  <p>"Where is Nora?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Sanders, I think you mean. She is on her way to London. What a
  stupid oaf you are, Cravel! Why do you imagine the inspector took you up to
  your room and kept you engaged in conversation for the best part of a quarter
  of an hour? We were getting Miss Sanders away from the house. My friend
  borrowed your pass-key very early in the morning, and I seized the
  opportunity while you were downstairs of making an inspection of your room.
  I'm rather glad you did not come up then, or I should have taken a course
  which would have defeated the ends of justice. In other words, I should have
  broken your neck. You know why I'm here now?"</p>

  <p>"I can guess it," said Cravel.</p>

  <p>He was quite calm now. Fear had dropped from him like a cloak in the
  presence of real danger.</p>

  <p>"I have come to give you a faint chance. I can promise you nothing," said
  Betcher Long. "I want to know how Monkford was killed, and if you were not
  instrumental in his death, then you've a chance."</p>

  <p>"If I turn State's evidence!" sneered the man. "And do you think, for one
  minute, knowing all you do, that I'm the sort of man to squeal on my
  friends?"</p>

  <p>He considered for a while.</p>

  <p>"So you had the pass-key? I didn't miss it until that damned inspector
  sent me down to get the key of No. 3."</p>

  <p>"And it was while you were looking for it that I opened No. 3 from the
  inside and revealed myself to the astounded constabulary," said Betcher. "You
  will remember that the Berkshire man came in alone to search the room. He did
  that because he knew that there were three people hidden there, and it also
  gave me an opportunity of telling him what I wanted him to do."</p>

  <p>"Where is my sister?" asked Cravel suddenly.</p>

  <p>"She has gone away with a friend of mine."</p>

  <p>"Arrested?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>Betcher nodded.</p>

  <p>"I think she will get off, but I rather fancy she will be the only one.
  Jackson Crayley might have escaped, too, but you anticipated the course of
  the law, judged and executed him. That was diabolical, Cravel&mdash;a most
  evil deed."</p>

  <p>Cravel did not meet the stern eyes of the detective; he was looking down
  at the ground. Betcher saw the patch of red come back to his face, but it was
  not the red of shame. Suddenly he looked up.</p>

  <p>"You want to know how Monkford was killed, and I suppose the best thing I
  can do in the circumstances is to tell you."</p>

  <p>"Did you shoot him?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't shoot him."</p>

  <p>"Did any of the others?"</p>

  <p>"No." Again he shook his head. "He shot himself." And seeing the
  unbelieving smile: "He shot himself, I tell you."</p>

  <p>"No weapon was found."</p>

  <p>"The weapon was found," said Cravel, "only you didn't know it when you had
  it in your hand. You want to know?"</p>

  <p>Betcher pointed to the door and the man walked out.</p>

  <p>"I'll borrow that pass-key of mine," he said, and the detective handing
  him the key, he opened the door of Monkford's bedroom.</p>

  <p>Cravel glanced at the yawning hole in the floor and smiled crookedly.</p>

  <p>"You want to keep away from that hole; we nearly had an accident there
  this morning," he said, and Betcher Long, whose sense of humour was never
  entirely suppressed, could appreciate the humour of the man he intended
  hanging.</p>

  <p>"The whole thing was very simple and very ingenious," began Cravel, "but
  like most of the simple and ingenious things of life&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he stopped and dropped his head.</p>

  <p>"My telephone bell is ringing. Can I go down?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Betcher nodded. There was no possible chance of the man's escape. The
  front and the rear of the house were guarded. He looked round the room, so
  full of poignant, painful memories. The bed was still drawn up on the far
  side of the cavity&mdash;how cleverly that trap had been planned for him! And
  here in this room Joshua Monkford had been stricken down in his health and
  pride, by an unknown assassin.</p>

  <p>He heard Cravel running up the stairs and went to the door to meet him.
  "It was for you," said the man, a little out of breath, "I've switched it
  through to this 'phone."</p>

  <p>Although the room had been partially dismantled, the telephone was still
  connected with a wall plug. He bent to the floor and picked it up, took off
  the receiver and listened.</p>

  <p>"There's nobody here&mdash;the line is dead," he said. "Exchange often
  gets that way. Wake 'em up."</p>

  <p>Betcher's finger was on the hook when a queer premonition of danger made
  his flesh creep.</p>

  <p>It was too late to inhibit the action. The hook was half pressed, but he
  dropped the receiver a little and then...</p>

  <p>The explosion deafened him, and he dropped the instrument to the ground
  and spun round, one hand to his ear. Cravel was standing bolt upright against
  the opposite wall, a look of comic surprise on his white face. Blood was
  pouring from his face, and in the centre of his forehead was a tiny red
  patch. He swayed slowly left and right, then fell in a crumpled heap on the
  ground&mdash;dead!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch43"
     name="ch43"></a>CHAPTER XLIII</h2>

  <p class="first">RUNNING to the head of the stairs, Betcher called to the man
  who was in charge below, and together they lifted the man on to the bed. Not
  an eyelash flickered. Betcher felt his wrist; it was pulseless, and, tearing
  open the shirt, listened at the man's heart.</p>

  <p>"But how did it happen, sir?" asked the officer.</p>

  <p>Arnold Long did not reply. He picked up the telephone and examined the
  receiver. In the centre, as in all telephone receivers, was a hole about half
  an inch in diameter, but, unlike other receivers, it was not backed by the
  sensitive diaphragm and he glanced down a rifled steel tube. Unscrewing the
  top, the mystery was a mystery no more. The telephone receiver was in fact
  modelled on the pattern of a humane-killer, with a chamber for the cartridge
  halfway up, and the shell was fired by an electric contact made when the hook
  was depressed.</p>

  <p>And then he remembered that he had both seen and handled the telephone and
  had actually called the office immediately after Monkford's death. Now he
  understood why the firework had been thrown into Nora's room, and why Cravel
  had distracted his attention elsewhere. It was to take away this instrument
  of death and to substitute the genuine telephone.</p>

  <p>He stopped at the local police station on his way back to town to break
  the news to Alice Cravel. To his surprise and relief, she learnt of her
  brother's death with great calmness.</p>

  <p>"I am very glad," she said simply. "It is better that he went&mdash;in
  that way. He must have been behind you in line with the receiver. You had a
  narrow escape, Mr. Long."</p>

  <p>"Did you know he had set that trap for me?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, I never dreamt he could persuade you to use the telephone. I was
  afraid of&mdash;of something else altogether."</p>

  <p>By the time he got back to his flat it was midday.</p>

  <p>"Sir Godley's valet has been telephoning all morning, sir," said his
  servant. "He wants me to tell you that your father has returned."</p>

  <p>"You surprise me," said Betcher.</p>

  <p>There was still work to be done. He interrupted a metropolitan police
  magistrate at his lunch, and secured certain authorizations which were
  necessary to him, and at half-past three, accompanied by the undaunted Rouch,
  who was officially on the sick list, he called at Lincoln's Inn Fields and
  was shown into Mr. Henry's neat office.</p>

  <p>At the appearance of the detective, Henry collapsed. It was the first
  intimation he had had that Betcher Long had escaped from the trap which had
  been set for him.</p>

  <p>He had not Cravel's power of dissimulation&mdash;none of his iron nerve.
  He sat, a limp and shaking figure, in his office chair, incapable of movement
  or of speech.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to distress you. I presume that you were under the impression I had
  passed to my fathers? You know me, Henry, and I think you can guess why I
  have come. I am going to take you into custody on a charge of being concerned
  in the wilful murder of Joshua Monkford on the 1st of August of this year. It
  is my duty to caution you that what you now say may be taken down and used in
  evidence against you."</p>

  <p>Still the young man did not speak. His brown eyes stared into vacancy. He
  was powerless to move, beyond consecutive thought, and not until the
  detective caught his arm and pulled him erect did his senses function.</p>

  <p>"Where's&mdash;where is Cravel?" he asked thickly.</p>

  <p>"Dead," said Betcher Long.</p>

  <p>The man gazed at him uncomprehendingly.</p>

  <p>"Dead, eh?" and then he began to chuckle. "That is funny. Sonny dead, eh?
  Damn' funny!"</p>

  <p>He was rolling his head from side to side, shaking with stupid laughter,
  as they hurried him across the sidewalk into the waiting taxi.</p>

     name="ch44"></a>CHAPTER XLIV</h2>

  <p class="first">MISS REVELSTOKE had spent a very exasperating forenoon. She
  was bereft of her secretary at a moment when her correspondence was unusually
  large, and she had no inclination to open the pile of letters that waited on
  her desk. Some of the letters were registered, all were urgent, for they
  contained bills which had been shelved for months.</p>

  <p>Her financial position was not a particularly good one at the moment. She
  had had to sell stocks at a loss; her expenses had been very heavy, and there
  had been certain vexatious lawsuits initiated against her. One immediate
  effect of Joshua Monkford's death which she could not have foreseen was that
  the bank had called in a very large overdraft, and had followed up the notice
  of its intention with a writ and the attachment of certain securities.</p>

  <p>Among the minor troubles of that morning was the eccentric behaviour of
  her telephone. She had made three attempts to get through to Heartsease, and
  every time the number was engaged. Nor had she been any more successful when
  she attempted to communicate with her lawyer; and the note she had sent by
  hand, dispatching a maid in a taxicab, had never been delivered, though this
  she did not know.</p>

  <p>In moments of distraction Miss Revelstoke had one sure refuge. She opened
  her work-basket and took out a piece of delicate cambric, threaded a needle,
  and began to sew. And she was so working when, glancing through the front
  window, she saw the taxicab stop and Betcher Long get out, and with him two
  other men, who, she did not doubt, were police officers.</p>

  <p>The maid was hurrying along the hall to answer the bell when Miss
  Revelstoke intercepted her.</p>

  <p>"I will answer the door. Go back to the servants' hall," she said, and
  watched the girl until she was out of sight.</p>

  <p>She had a small pair of scissors in her hand, and the fine wire
  communicating between bell-push and servants' hall ran along the wall within
  her reach. She stretched up her arm and cut the wire, passed out through her
  study into the courtyard behind, stopping only to put on her hat and take her
  bag from the table.</p>

  <p>Opening the garage door, she started the engine and swung the machine, not
  to the right, which would bring her to the front of the house, but to the
  left. She could, and did, slip through a side street here, and came to
  Ladbroke Grove near the railway station. Here she stopped the machine and
  went up the steps and bought a ticket for Liverpool Street. Within a quarter
  of an hour of her reaching that terminus, the Clacton express pulled out of
  the station, carrying in a first-class carriage an unconcerned woman who was
  systematically examining the evening papers she had bought.</p>

  <p>She was alone in her compartment, and with the aid of a comb and a small
  powder bag, she managed to produce a remarkable change in her appearance.</p>

  <p>Clacton-on-Sea is a popular resort, crowded, at this period of the year,
  with trippers and holiday-makers. And three times a week an excursion steamer
  called on its way from Tilbury, and for a very small sum it was possible to
  travel to Ostend, spend a night in that resort of beauty and fashion, and
  return on the following morning. The boat left within an hour of Miss
  Revelstoke's arrival, and she was one of its passengers. She carried no
  baggage but her umbrella and the two tightly packed pockets attached to an
  underskirt which she wore by day and had folded under her pillow by
  night.</p>

  <p>No passports were required from the excursionists, and if they had been,
  Miss Revelstoke had one to produce. She walked over the cobbled streets of
  Ostend until she came to the broad promenade, crowded at this hour with gay
  humanity.</p>

  <p>Miss Revelstoke was not gay, but was very adaptable, and the
  quasi-carnival in progress had a special appeal for her. She might sacrifice
  her dignity and wear a mask with the rest of the revellers, but there was no
  reason why she should. She was here on business; there were quite a number of
  good shops where women's clothing could be bought, and on the Place des Armes
  a store or two where she could acquire the dress of a well-to-do peasant
  woman. She hated black bonnets, but she bought one, and an old-fashioned
  mantle and a long, heavy skirt and spring-side boots. These, with a pair of
  gold-rimmed spectacles and a heavy-looking bag, were all the disguise that
  she needed. When she had changed in the little hotel where she took a room,
  and had washed some of the dye out of her hair with strong soda-water, even
  Betcher Long might not have recognized her.</p>

  <p>She made her discarded clothes into a bundle, which she put under her arm,
  and, paying her bill&mdash;the landlady was so interested in some grievance
  of her own that she scarcely noticed the transformation&mdash;she walked to
  the marine station. On the way, she acquired a large umbrella, and this, with
  her bundle, completed the picture.</p>

  <p>That night she reached Brussels and slept in a third-rate hotel, confiding
  to the concierge that she was a Walloon and had been on a visit to her son in
  eastern Flanders. Her French was perhaps a little too classical for a
  Walloon, but the concierge never for a moment thought that she was anything
  but what she pretended to be, for she tipped him meanly and refused a cab to
  carry her to the eastern station.</p>

  <p>She went no farther than Liege. Here she got lodgings in a respectable
  part of the town and spent her time in studying the English newspapers which
  she purchased at the railway station, mispronouncing their titles vilely.</p>

  <p>Cravel was dead, Alice and Henry under arrest. She worried much about
  Henry, for she was very fond of him, and worried more when she learnt that
  "the prisoner was unable to appear, and the doctors certified that he was in
  such a condition of mind that he might not be fit to plead."</p>

  <p>A month passed. The preliminary hearing of the two was adjourned from week
  to week. And then she noticed with a frown that the Crown proposed to offer
  no evidence against Alice, and that she had been discharged. She had never
  liked Alice. Alice was a friend of Jackson Crayley, and Alice was full of
  scruples at times.</p>

  <p>Madame Pontière, as she called herself, seemed likely to become a settled
  institution of Liege. She had obtained a police card of identity, duly filled
  up, and nothing seemed likely to disturb her serenity, for she learnt from
  the newspapers that she had disappeared and was believed to have gone to
  America.</p>

  <p>And then, one morning, when she was coming out of the Cathedral, her big
  prayer book in her gloved hand, she came face to face with a man who raised
  his hat to her.</p>

  <p>"Miss Revelstoke, I presume?" he said politely, and she walked back to the
  police office with Betcher Long, offering no comment, no reproach, and no
  threat. But Betcher felt that he was walking on those sunlit streets with
  stark murder personified.</p>

  <p>The extradition proceedings were not protracted. One morning Miss
  Revelstoke stepped out of the Sûreté office accompanied by a woman police
  officer, and was put into a train that made a non-stop run to Brussels all
  too quickly. The transfer across Brussels was carried out with dispatch, and
  at five o'clock on a gray morning she landed at Dover. It was only then that
  she spoke directly to Betcher. Throughout the journey she had maintained a
  stony silence, and when he had spoken to her, had apparently not heard him.
  Now, as they walked up the platform to the train, she turned her head
  slightly. "How is Henry?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," said Betcher, "that your son will never be able to
  plead."</p>

  <p>She made no reply; not so much as a flicker of eyelid betrayed the despair
  in the heart of this iron-willed woman.</p>

  <p>As the train was running through Bromley she spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Alice squealed, of course? She was born that way&mdash;soft as butter.
  Not even the doctor could stiffen her."</p>

  <p>It was the first news that Betcher Long had of Cravel's profession.</p>

  <p>On the day "Miss Revelstoke" was sent to penal servitude for life, and the
  smiling, foolish young man who stood by her side in the dock was ordered to
  be detained during the King's pleasure, Betcher Long came into the office of
  his chief and handed him a written letter.</p>

  <p>Colonel Macfarlane read it very carefully.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry about this, Betcher," he said. "Just when your name has gone
  forward for promotion. You have a record now&mdash;due to be a chief
  detective-inspector at twenty-seven would beat all records. But if you feel
  you ought to go, I can't stop you. And on the whole, I think you are right to
  cut out police work and turn your mind to money-making. When do you want to
  be released?"</p>

  <p>"At once," said Betcher, "if that is possible."</p>

  <p>Colonel Macfarlane put the letter into his "immediate" basket.</p>

  <p>"I'll see what I can do about it. It may be two or three days before we
  can get your discharge through. But what is the hurry?"</p>

  <p>Betcher did not answer this quite satisfactorily. He reached Berkeley
  Square at the moment his father's car stopped before the door, and Sir Godley
  and Nora Sanders got out. She had been away in the country; had not heard how
  the trial had ended. When, later, Betcher told her, she shuddered.</p>

  <p>"It is very dreadful," she said in a low voice. "And I'm sorry for
  her&mdash;in a way."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I ought to be sorry, too," said Sir Godley, selecting a cigar
  from the box on his library table. "And yet I can't be."</p>

  <p>"Why should you be so especially sorry?" asked Nora in surprise.</p>

  <p>The older man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Tell her why you should be sorry," said Arnold Long quietly.</p>

  <p>"Because"&mdash;he lit the cigar, blew out the match and put it down with
  tantalizing deliberation&mdash;"because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The telephone bell rang at that moment. He took up the receiver and
  listened. Betcher Long saw a frown gather on his father's face.</p>

  <p>"But that is extraordinary," said Sir Godley. Somebody at the other end
  spoke earnestly&mdash;afterward he learnt that it was the prison
  chaplain.</p>

  <p>"Very good&mdash;I will come." He put down the instrument, and the eyes of
  father and son met. "She wishes to see me," he said shortly.</p>

  <p>"You? Why on earth" began the girl, and saw something in his face which
  silenced her.</p>

  <p>"I think I had better see her," he said, and went out of the room.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch45"
     name="ch45"></a>CHAPTER XLV</h2>

  <p class="first">IT WAS a fine afternoon, but it might have been thundering
  or snowing for all the baronet noticed as he drove through the outer circle
  of Regent's Park and came to the shabby dreariness of Camden Town.</p>

  <p>The newspaper bills that gave the only colour to the streets said
  "Revelstoke Sentenced" or "Heavy Sentence on Terrible Woman," for such the
  reporters, with one accord, had christened her.</p>

  <p>Sir Godley hunched back farther in his car and sighed. The Terrible Woman!
  It must be twenty-five&mdash;thirty years since they met face to face. The
  coming interview would be unpleasant&mdash;might even be fearful&mdash;but he
  had a strong sense of duty. He had the merchant's desire to rule a red line
  under her account in the place where "<i>Finis</i>" comes in a story-teller's
  tale.</p>

  <p>And here was the end of high adventure and heartache and regretful
  memories such as middle-aged men have when they approach the sixties.</p>

  <p>Holloway Prison has an appearance of mediaevalism. It has turrets, and
  frowning battlements, and a high central keep elongated into a tower where,
  it is popularly supposed, armed warders watch the walls, though this legend
  is not substantiated. A great forbidding gate blocks the central archway.</p>

  <p>He found an entrance, and was admitted to the gate-keeper's lobby, and
  identified himself before he was handed to a bright-faced woman of thirty in
  the uniform of a wardress and by her conducted to a superior officer.</p>

  <p>The acting chaplain was waiting for him, a nervous young man who had taken
  the place of the prison chaplain then on vacation.</p>

  <p>Here, Sir Godley learnt for the first time that he was admitted to the
  prison by Home Office order, that the circumstances were unusual (with this
  he was in mental agreement), and that he must make no statement to the press.
  The last injunction seemed superfluous.</p>

  <p>"She is in wonderful spirits," said the chaplain fervently (it was his
  first important prisoner, and he found Miss Revelstoke a fascinating object
  of interest), "and of course, ordinarily, I should not have applied to
  Whitehall. But she was so insistent&mdash;she has something to communicate,
  and as you are the president of the Bankers' Association..."</p>

  <p>Godley Long had, to his surprise, been elected that week to fill the post
  rendered vacant by the death of Monkford. "I quite understand," he said.</p>

  <p>It was queer that he should have come to Holloway Jail to soothe a
  fluttered chaplain.</p>

  <p>"We will go. The interview will be private, though officially I shall be
  present."</p>

  <p>He had a quick, nervous way of talking as he walked, and as they traversed
  the corridor he made other unnecessary explanations; unnecessary, because the
  banker knew exactly why he had been sent for.</p>

  <p>They came to a hall that was garlanded with steel galleries and had little
  doors set at regular intervals in the distempered walls.</p>

  <p>Miss Revelstoke occupied a roomy cell on the ground floor&mdash;he
  suspected, with some justification, that it was the cell usually occupied by
  women under sentence of death, but he made no inquiries.</p>

  <p>The wardress snapped back the lock and pushed the door inward.</p>

  <p>"The door will be left open," said the chaplain hurriedly. "I will remain
  outside."</p>

  <p>It required now a conscious effort, and the banker made it. He was in the
  cell, light and airy and meagrely furnished.</p>

  <p>The woman was standing with her back to the farther wall, very composed,
  her dark eyes smiling. Usually, a prisoner, on entering the jail, changes her
  clothing for prison garb, but she wore the dress she had on at the
  trial&mdash;a neat blue suit. He learnt afterward that she was to be
  transferred immediately to one of the women's convict establishments outside
  of London, for reasons which, to the authorities, seemed good and
  sufficient.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, Godley&mdash;it was very nice of you to come."</p>

  <p>He inclined his head slightly.</p>

  <p>"That boy of yours is rather clever&mdash;he inherits that from his
  mother, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>The studied insolence of the greeting did not surprise him. She had not
  altered in twenty years, was the same self-possessed, contemptuous creature
  he had known.</p>

  <p>"Naturally, I never dreamt that he was a relation of Clay's," she said;
  "the name struck me as a coincidence. If I had known, it might have made a
  lot of difference to me&mdash;and to you."</p>

  <p>If she hoped to provoke him to speech, she was to be disappointed. He
  nodded silently.</p>

  <p>Age had brought changes to them both, but for all the lines and wrinkles,
  the sallowing of skin and hollowness of cheek, he would have recognized
  her.</p>

  <p>"I want you to look after Alice and Henry," she went on calmly. "Alice
  doesn't interest me a great deal, and she can fend for herself. And Henry, I
  suppose, will be looked after. But it would make me happier to know that
  somebody outside&mdash;had him under his eye."</p>

  <p>"I will do that for you," said the banker readily.</p>

  <p>She was looking at him oddly.</p>

  <p>"You have changed, but your voice is the same&mdash;I would know it
  anywhere. Life is queer, isn't it? Clay dead&mdash;and the others, and your
  boy brought it all about! Wherever he moved, death came."</p>

  <p>She spoke without heat or bitterness. She might be reviewing the lives of
  people in whom she had no direct interest. Godley could only marvel at her
  self-possession.</p>

  <p>"The police officers I have spoken to call him 'Lucky Long,' and I suppose
  chance played its part. Godley, why do you think I am taking this punishment
  so easily? Does that seem strange to you, knowing how clever a general Clay
  was?"</p>

  <p>"That occurred to me," he said.</p>

  <p>She was watching him with her dark eyes.</p>

  <p>"He was so wonderful," she went on, "he provided for all contingencies. He
  would never have been hanged, only, in the struggle with your son, his coat
  was ripped down the back, and the dull fools at the police station provided
  him with another."</p>

  <p>He could dimly understand her meaning.</p>

  <p>"As I remember the case," he said, "nothing was found in the pockets of
  the coat but a few papers."</p>

  <p>The reply seemed to amuse her.</p>

  <p>"I want you to think about what I have said," she continued after a
  pause.</p>

  <p>The chaplain's anxious face appeared at the open door. He had a watch in
  his hand. Obviously, her time was short.</p>

  <p>"I want you to digest the facts. Clay would have been alive, Sonny
  Cravel&mdash; Jackson Crayley, all would have been living; Henry, that poor
  boy, would be sane and in the enjoyment of life; I should have been sewing in
  my room in Colville Gardens, if it had not been for your&mdash;son."</p>

  <p>His stem eyes fixed hers.</p>

  <p>"And Monkford&mdash;and the other people he killed. The judge and the
  lawyer and the wretched hangman," he said harshly. "I tell you this, Alicia,
  that I am thankful to God that Arnold caught this man, thankful for all he
  has done to bring your confederates to ruin. If you think you can deceive me,
  as you deceive yourself, and can arouse in my heart pity or remorse, you are
  wasting your time!"</p>

  <p>She was not offended. The eyes were still smiling as she took a folded
  piece of paper from the little table-ledge and held it out to him.</p>

  <p>"This will explain my point of view," she said, and as he reached out his
  hand to take the paper, she released her hold and it fluttered to the
  floor.</p>

  <p>He took a step forward and stooped to pick it up...</p>

  <p>It was the cry of the clergyman at the door that saved his life. The hand
  that she had held in the fold of her dress came up, something glittered for a
  space and fell, driven by all her strength. The warning cry of the chaplain
  made him fling himself to one side. The thin knife snicked his shoulders, and
  in a second the fury was struggling in his arms. She had the strength of a
  man. Twice the knife missed his face by a hair's-breadth and then, with a
  superhuman effort, she flung him back from her, tore at the lapel of her coat
  and put her hand to her mouth.</p>

  <p>The cell was full of wardresses by now, but she offered no resistance, and
  the knife dropped with a clang to the hard floor&mdash;and then they saw that
  its handle had the shape of a shoe-heel. Clay had indeed been a good general,
  for throughout her trial that razor-sharp blade had been sheathed between the
  upper and lower sole of the shoe she wore.</p>

  <p>Sir Godley, white and shaken, went back to the governor's office and was
  left there alone for a long time.</p>

  <p>Presently the deputy came in. His face was black with trouble.</p>

  <p>"Did you give the woman anything?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Sir Godley looked at him in wonder.</p>

  <p>"Give her anything&mdash;what do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Poison?"</p>

  <p>The banker was aghast.</p>

  <p>"Good God, no!" he said. "Is she&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The deputy nodded.</p>

  <p>"She is dead," he said simply; "one of the buttons of her coat is
  missing&mdash;I think the poison must have been in that."</p>

  <p>And now the banker understood why the changing of Clay Shelton's coat had
  stopped him from cheating the gallows.</p>

  <p>A good general&mdash;but even the best of generals make their blunders</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch46"
     name="ch46"></a>CHAPTER XLVI</h2>

  <p class="first">A FORTNIGHT had passed&mdash;the inquest had been a day's
  wonder and had been forgotten. Betcher did not see his father, but Nora
  Sanders was his daily companion. She needed his advice, for she had decided
  not to apply for probate of the Monkford will.</p>

  <p>"The signature may have been a forgery," she said, and Betcher, who had no
  doubt at all on the subject, agreed.</p>

  <p>Sir Godley came back from Bournemouth a new man, though the attack on him
  had shaken him more than he cared to confess. That night, when dinner was
  finished and the servants had withdrawn, he rested his elbows on the table
  and turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Did you read the account of the inquest?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Arnold wouldn't let me see the newspapers," she said, "and even if he
  had, I shouldn't have read the account. The only thing I saw was a big
  placard which said: 'Banker's Amazing Story'&mdash;was that you?"</p>

  <p>"That was me!" said Sir Godley grimly, "and the amazing story was the one
  I was about to tell you when I was interrupted."</p>

  <p>"Who was Miss Revelstoke?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Sir Godley drew a long breath, reached out mechanically for a cigar, and
  cut it with a hand that was surprisingly steady.</p>

  <p>"She was my wife," he said.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch47"
     name="ch47"></a>CHAPTER XLVII</h2>

  <p class="first">"THE full story of the Terrible People did not come out in
  court, and thank Heaven it wasn't necessary that I should be in attendance.
  Clay Shelton was my brother&mdash;or rather, my half-brother. He was a wild,
  unscrupulous young man, who robbed my father and was afterward to rob me. At
  the time he bolted, as eventually he did when our father discovered the
  theft, I was engaged to a pretty Danish girl, a Miss Ostrander, who had come
  to England to act as governess to a neighbour of ours. I met her at a garden
  party, fell in love with her, and soon after my brother's departure, I
  married her. "</p>

  <p>He knocked off the ash of his cigar with a grim little smile.</p>

  <p>"I hope it will never be your experience to make the discovery which was
  mine. Outwardly, she was the sweetest, dearest girl you could imagine. On the
  day we married, she told me something that knocked me over&mdash;she was in
  love with my brother, and had only married me in order that the child she was
  expecting should not be nameless. Why she told me at all, I have never
  understood. I think she wanted to hurt me, or perhaps revolt me so that I
  should show her no marks of an affection which she confessed she loathed.</p>

  <p>"I was a pretty good-natured fellow in those days, with a tremendously
  high opinion of women, and the discovery was the severest blow I have ever
  received. We had gone off to Copenhagen on our honeymoon, and it was on the
  boat crossing the North Sea that she dropped this bombshell. Three days after
  we reached the Danish capital, she left me. She had gone out to do some
  shopping, and I waited an hour for dinner, at the end of which time I
  received a note, delivered by hand, saying that she did not intend to return,
  and that she had gone where true happiness was to be found. I immediately
  filed a suit for divorce, citing a lover who I swore was unknown to me. The
  divorce was granted, and I believe they married&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"On February 8, 1886," interrupted his son. "That was the third date
  carved on the cabin panel. The second was the date of his wife's birth. The
  fourth was the birth of Crayley, or in other words, Jackson Crayley
  Long."</p>

  <p>"Crayley was the name of our family seat in Yorkshire, by the way," Sir
  Godley went on. "I never saw or heard of them until one day my manager came
  to me in a great state of mind and told me that we had paid out sixty
  thousand pounds on a forged bill of exchange. My first thought was, of
  course, to put the matter in the hands of the police. I sent for the bill,
  and on the back of it I saw pencilled two letters 'J. X.' They had escaped
  the attention of the cashier, but I knew from the peculiarity of the
  writing&mdash;John's X was different from any other X in the world&mdash;that
  the forger was my brother, and that he had put those initials there as a
  challenge. I paid sixty thousand pounds out of my own private fortune, and
  inserted an advertisement in the agony column of the Times beginning 'J. X.:
  This time I have honoured, but next time I will betray you.' He never
  attempted to catch me again, but very soon after this began the series of
  international forgeries which made the name of Clay Shelton infamous.</p>

  <p>"There was one thing about Clay Shelton that I can admire&mdash;I use that
  name in preference to any other&mdash;his iron restraint. He was married, he
  had a growing family, yet he was never with them except for three weeks in
  the year, when they all met at a little Danish watering-place on the Baltic.
  The children were brought up in Denmark, and learned to speak the language as
  fluently as their own. And then, as they came of age, Clay had the courage to
  tell them of his profession. He knew that, if they were kept together, sooner
  or later he might be detected, and disgrace would fall upon every member of
  the family.</p>

  <p>"So he hit upon this novel expedient: each member was trained to be a
  distinct identity. None of them was to pretend he was related to the others,
  except when they met for their yearly reunion. The mother came to England and
  established herself as a maiden lady of independent means. The boys went to
  different schools under different names, and as they grew up they were
  entered in different professions. Crayley became a landed proprietor; they
  bought him a farm, which he mismanaged on behalf of the family; they bought a
  house on the river for him, and his job was to travel the Continent, get in
  touch with wealthy people, and not only procure their signatures but learn
  everything there was to be learnt about their private lives.</p>

  <p>"Henry became a lawyer; a practice was bought for him, but this did not
  happen until after the second son, Cravel, was established as proprietor of
  Heartsease. In this role, not only did he turn over his capital at a profit,
  but a home was found for the one daughter of the marriage, Alice. Cravel was
  the right-hand man of his father. Jackson Crayley, as we called him, was the
  family fool. He bungled everything&mdash;I am telling you now what I have
  learnt from Arnold. He even brought about his father's death by his stupidity
  in passing him the pistol the moment he was arrested. His mother hated him,
  for some reason which even Arnold doesn't understand, and eventually was to
  achieve his death.</p>

  <p>"Crayley was a good fellow who hated his work, and sought every
  opportunity of shaking himself free from the trammels of his horrible
  association and living a decent life. In this he was seconded by his sister
  Alice. These two were great friends. But the strong man, after his father's
  death, was Cravel, though it was Miss Revelstoke, as we called her, who
  employed the riff-raff of the underworld to carry out the work of the
  Terrible People; she who, in a man's garb and wearing a white wig, hired the
  thugs. But it was Cravel who was near at hand to kill the assassin, whether
  he failed or succeeded.</p>

  <p>"Cravel had bad sight, or he would have done his own shooting. On the
  morning Arnold came back from Chelmsford Jail, he was shadowed by Henry on a
  motorcycle, Henry's task being to bomb my son's car if the marksman failed to
  get him. It was fairly simple, wasn't it, Arnold?"</p>

  <p>Betcher Long nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes; they had a greengrocer's Ford in the cut road, and as soon as Harry
  the Lancer was dead, the car went on, picked up Henry and his motor-cycle,
  and got clean away."</p>

  <p>"One by one they killed the men who had brought their father to his death,
  and Cravel was the leading spirit. He had taken a doctor's degree before his
  father gave him the money to buy Heartsease, and there can be little doubt
  that he infected the judge and organized the artistic accident which ended
  the life of the counsel; but it was he and Henry who lay in wait for Wallis,
  the hangman.</p>

  <p>"Poor Jackson Crayley! He bungled all things. Even his heliographed signal
  was a blunder, for it nearly cost Cravel his liberty. And all the time,
  behind Cravel and behind Henry, was the directing force and
  <i>generalissimo</i> of Colville Gardens!"</p>

  <p>"Was it due to any machinations that I became her secretary?" asked the
  fascinated girl.</p>

  <p>Sir Godley shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It was an accident that she employed you, but once you were in her house
  she searched to find a use for you. It was the day you visited Monkford that
  Miss Revelstoke decided how you were to be employed. You have told us how,
  when you came back, she said that Monkford had rung up and had been loud in
  his praise of you.</p>

  <p>Monkford had not touched the telephone. And then this was followed up by
  the arrival of the mysterious ring&mdash;Monkford again. All this was
  intended to give plausibility to the will, which had already been drawn up by
  Henry and the signature forged.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately for the wretched woman, the ring she gave you was one which
  Arnold had seen on a picture of her when she was a girl. The identical
  setting, the identical ring. It was that clue which put him on the trail.
  When he came to me with a description of the jewel, I was able to tell him
  that it was the identical ring that I bought for the woman the first day we
  arrived in Copenhagen!</p>

  <p>"Alice Long has been able to tell us what happened the afternoon before
  Monkford's murder. Henry and Crayley&mdash;I suspect Henry as being the prime
  mover&mdash; carried a story to Monkford to this effect, that Arnold had been
  spreading stories about Monkford and you, Nora. Monkford was naturally
  furious. Though he may have liked you, he had not the slightest idea of love
  or marriage. He was, in fact, a confirmed bachelor. But they needed this
  attitude of his to prevent his consulting with Arnold. That was the devilish
  ingenuity of it. They knew that if he was sore with Betcher he would keep my
  son at a distance, and they wanted him kept at a distance until their wicked
  work was finished. How he died, you know. The telephone was probably the
  invention of Cravel, who was an ingenious workman.</p>

  <p>"I can say honestly that I had not the slightest idea of Miss Revelstoke's
  identity, even after I had heard of the ring, until one night I went out to
  post a letter and a taxi passed me, containing an old gentleman. The 'old
  gentleman's' hand was resting on the window ledge. As the car passed, I
  caught a glimpse of the face. For a second, the dark eyes rested on mine, and
  I nearly dropped. Not all these years could efface the memory of Alicia
  Ostrander, and instinctively I knew that Alicia Ostrander and Miss Revelstoke
  were one and the same person. There was no reason why I should associate
  them, but I did.</p>

  <p>"My cab followed the other until it reached Colville Gardens, where it
  turned into a back mews, and now I was certain. I had a little talk with the
  cabman, and asked him if he was game to follow her machine that night if it
  came out again. He had a new car, and when I told him who I was, he said he
  was not only willing, but curious. I rather fancy that he suspected me of
  being something of a gay dog! Though I did not anticipate that she would
  appear again, whilst I was talking, her car came out of the mews, and passed
  me so closely that I saw the face of the driver.</p>

  <p>"And now I was absolutely sure. It was raining, and that helped a lot to
  make my pursuit possible, for otherwise we should never have been able to
  keep up with the machine. It was easier outside of town, because the roads
  were slippery and both cars had to move with caution. I induced the driver,
  after considerable persuasion, to dim his lamps, but I might have saved
  myself the trouble, for she did not expect the pursuit, and I doubt very much
  if she once looked back. We came at last to a place which I guessed was the
  Heartsease of which I had heard so much. The car passed through the gate, and
  here I left the cabman and continued my journey on foot.</p>

  <p>"The rain was heavy now, and I took up my position under a cedar which
  gave me some sort of protection. The woman had disappeared into the hotel,
  and then I saw a man come out and take the car away, presumably to the
  garage. I waited and waited feeling rather a fool, and wondering what my
  cabman was thinking of me, and at last decided that I'd be a sensible man if
  I went home to my alarmed household. I was walking down the drive when two
  brilliant lights appeared ahead of me, and I had just time to conceal myself
  when a big motor-ambulance flashed past and stopped, not in front of the
  portico, but at the side door where Miss Revelstoke had gone in.</p>

  <p>"I walked back, keeping well to cover, and I saw them lift out a
  stretcher, and one of the men, who was, I think, Cravel, lift a figure in his
  arms and take it into the hotel. Almost at once the ambulance wheeled round
  and went back the way it had come. My curiosity was piqued, and though I am
  no longer young, a certain amount of athletic prowess remains with me. The
  front door of the hotel was closed, but there was a portico, and on top a
  small balcony. Here I narrowly escaped an accident which might have proved
  serious. Workmen had been digging in the grounds, and I all but stumbled into
  a deep hole. As it was, I took a bad fall on the grass, losing my glasses and
  ruining irretrievably my dress suit&mdash;which, of course, I was still
  wearing. Five minutes' strenuous work brought me to the top of the portico
  and to a window which I had no difficulty in forcing.</p>

  <p>"I realized that my curiosity could be construed as being unpardonable,
  and that I might possibly find myself in a very embarrassing position. But in
  spite of this, I opened the window and stepped into what proved to be the
  corridor of the first floor. I heard voices somewhere, but the place was in
  darkness, and I felt my way along the wall, trying every door. They were all
  locked. I climbed to the second floor, and then I heard somebody speaking,
  and at the first sound of Miss Revelstoke's voice, my mind went back nearly
  thirty years, and I remembered the day when she had expressed her frank
  opinion of me on that dancing little packet-boat! But what she was saying
  interested me most; so cold-blooded, so horrible was her scheme that I felt
  my scanty hair rising. I decided I must find a hiding place, and tried the
  doors on that floor, but they were all locked. Making my way downstairs, I
  came to the hall which opens into the lounge, as you know, Arnold. The first
  thing I saw, by the faint light of a night lamp which was burning on a table,
  was the open door of the office. I went in, dared to switch on the light,
  knowing that generally in the manager's office some sort of key was found,
  and then, by great good luck, I saw the pass-key hanging on a small hook
  inside the roll-top desk. I took this and went up the stairs as fast as I
  could. I had reached the first landing when I saw a light above, and opening
  the nearest door, I slipped in and stood waiting until they had gone."</p>

  <p>Sir Godley smiled ruefully.</p>

  <p>"My narrative might very easily have ended there. Putting out my foot, I
  touched nothing. I had a box of matches in my pocket, and one of these I
  struck, and for the first time saw the hole in the floor and in the roof
  above&mdash; the cavity above being covered by what looked to be the
  underside of a carpet. It was not very hard to guess that some structural
  alterations were in progress. The scaffold poles, the builders' tools which
  were lying in the room, all pointed to a very simple explanation.</p>

  <p>"I had locked the door on the inside when I went in, and now I waited for
  a very considerable time, hoping that the three people who were in the hotel
  would go away. But throughout the night either one or the other seemed to be
  on the stairs or within listening distance. I could only speculate as to who
  was the unfortunate creature that had been brought in the ambulance, but I
  know now my speculations were exact. Hour after hour passed, and then, to my
  astonishment and joy, I heard Betcher's voice. As he went up the stairs, he
  passed within a few yards of me, and I waited, wondering exactly what would
  happen.</p>

  <p>"After a long and bewildering silence, I heard steps in the room above,
  and his voice came clear. The hole in the ceiling of the room was, as you
  know, covered with carpet, and, strangely enough, the first thought I had,
  when I heard Arnold upstairs, was whether he would make a slip. I heard
  Arnold speak and Cravel answer, and then he moved toward the carpet, and I
  had opened my mouth to warn him, but the carpet doubled, something shot down
  in the dark, bounced off a piece of scaffolding, and knocked me flying. I
  just caught hold of him and pulled him to safety and for that reason he was
  not seen when Cravel looked down.</p>

  <p>"I began to realize now that both I and my boy were in a peculiarly tight
  corner, and I was particularly grateful at the thought that in my hip pocket
  was a little automatic that I have been carrying for some considerable time
  Fortunately, Betcher was unconscious and could not betray his presence, and
  after half an hour of shuffling and walking and talking above the stairs,
  there was silence.</p>

  <p>"There was no water; I could not dress his wound, but I could feel that he
  was not very badly hurt. I think he was more winded than wounded," Sir Godley
  chuckled, "and I'm rather glad he was, for by the time he had breath to
  speak, the people upstairs had gone. I told him who I was and what had
  happened, and told him about the pass-key.</p>

  <p>"There was a window in the room, and through this I saw the car, which
  evidently held Miss Revelstoke and her son Henry, leave the place. Arnold's
  first thought was of you, Nora, and when, after a little wait, I saw Cravel
  driving my son's car away, we began a search of the house, starting at the
  bottom and gradually working up. It was a long business, and I had expected,
  for some reason, that you were in one of the rooms on the ground floor. I
  suppose it was, seeing you carried in unconscious, I imagined that it would
  be too much of a business to carry you upstairs.</p>

  <p>"We had reached the first floor when he heard Cravel return, and again hid
  in No. 3. There was a long wait. Once Arnold thought he heard your voice,
  Nora, but that passed, and then Cravel went downstairs.</p>

  <p>"'We'll risk it,' said Arnold, and up we went, and the first door we
  opened was that of Cravel's apartments.</p>

  <p>"We wrapped you in a blanket and carried you downstairs, to No. 3. We
  could, of course, have confronted the man, but Betcher thought there was some
  danger, and that, in his desperation, Cravel might shoot. And then, most
  providentially, the Berkshire police arrived, in response to Rouch's
  telephone message, and it was when they came to No. 3 and Cravel had gone
  down to get his pass-key that Arnold unlocked the door from the inside,
  showing himself to the inspector and persuading him to hold this diabolical
  villain in conversation whilst we got you, Nora, my dear, to safety. And
  that's the story."</p>

  <p>"And a darned good story, too," said Betcher. "If it has a fault, it is
  that it does not quite throw the highlights upon my acumen and valour, but I
  shall have plenty of time to impress those qualities upon you."</p>

  <p>Nora smiled into his eyes.</p>

  <p>Under her own hand, she had already instructed her lawyers not to ask for
  probate of the forged will. And really, as it proved, there was no necessity.
  On the day before her marriage, Sir Godley Long made a settlement upon her
  which startled even his son. And it took a whole lot to startle Betcher
  Long.</p>
