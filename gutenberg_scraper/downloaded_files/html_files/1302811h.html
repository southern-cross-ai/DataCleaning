  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE FIRST ADVENTURE</h2>

  <p class="first">Economy, whether of money or of labor, was carried by Mrs.
  E. Garrison to the nth degree, for economy of all kinds was necessary to the
  maintenance of her family. She had eight sons and no daughters. Three of the
  sons had been born at one time, and two at another. She threw herself with
  devotion into the battle to support these eight lives decently. A remnant of
  youth and good looks she sacrificed first, then all her time, her temper, her
  powers of body and soul went into the endless struggle, and she was so far
  victorious that neither Mrs. Oldham, right-hand neighbor, nor Mrs. Taylor on
  her left could ever find spot or speck on the new-burnished faces of the
  Garrison boys when they herded off to school in the morning. Work turned her
  to a famine-stricken wraith. But her heart grew stronger as she saw the fruit
  of her agony, eight boys with straight bodies and fresh, clear eyes.</p>

  <p>On this wash Monday, having hung out the sheets and the pillowcases, the
  napkins, and the tablecloths, and all the whites, she dragged the clothes
  basket back to the kitchen to start the colored articles boiling in the same
  water that had served for the first batch. Time was when she had changed the
  water for each set of clothes, but now that her shoulders cracked under the
  weight of the boiler she moved it as seldom as possible.</p>

  <p>"Besides," as she said, "clear water ain't what cleans 'em&mdash;it's the
  boiling and the soap and the blessed elbow grease." Yet, on this day, having
  dumped the colored things into the boiler and opened the door of the stove to
  shovel in more coal, she discovered that the last live cinder was turning
  from red to black&mdash;the fire was out. It was a calamity, for already the
  afternoon wore on, and she must rush to finish the washing in time to cook
  supper. That was the only point on which her husband was adamant&mdash;meals
  had to be punctual. Then she thought of assistance, and remembered that her
  eldest son was home; the teacher of his class was ill, which accounted for
  the vacation.</p>

  <p>"The great lummox," muttered Mrs. Garrison. "He ought to have been down
  here hours ago, helpin' me hang out and rinsin'." She went to the foot of the
  backstairs, narrow, unpainted, and dark, the one untidy place of the
  house.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lee!" she called. "Lee!"</p>

  <p>From above, half whine, half growl: "Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Come down this minute and chop me some kindling. The fire's out."</p>

  <p>"Wait till I finish this page."</p>

  <p>"I'll wait for nothing. You come hopping, young man."</p>

  <p>She heard the clap of the book being shut, the sound of heavy footfalls
  overhead, and she went into the dining room for an instant's rest. It was a
  hot day in June, with just enough breeze to drag the smoke from the factories
  over the town, imperiling the washings that sparkled in a thousand back
  yards, and filling the air with a thick, sweet odor of soot. Mrs. Garrison
  relaxed in her husband's armchair in the coolest corner of the room and bent
  her head to think over the dishes for supper. She closed her eyes, too, and
  in a moment she was asleep, but she kept on working in her dream, heard the
  kindling dumped with a rattle on the kitchen floor, and dragged herself from
  the chair to open the dampers so that the fire roared and the water began to
  foam in the boiler.</p>

  <p>In reality, Lee Garrison had not left his room. That noisy closing of the
  book, the thumping of his feet on the floor, all were a ruse. He had only sat
  forward in his chair and drummed with his heels. His thumb had kept the
  place, when he snapped the book shut, and now he opened it, still sitting on
  the edge of the chair, still bending to rise, while his eye swept through the
  rest of the adventure. For ten swarthy giants had just started into the path
  of Lancelot and barred his way to the perilous chapel with a voice of
  thunder. They scattered again as the good knight put forward his shield and
  drew his sword against such great odds as these, and Lee Garrison went with
  Lancelot into the chapel itself, where only one light burned and where the
  corpse lay "hylled in silk." He did not change that cramped position, as if
  about to rise.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was hours later when he heard the deep voice of his father downstairs,
  and his mother pouring out a protest. Then he laid aside his Malory with a
  sigh and stood up. Plainly he would never approach the height or the bulk of
  William Garrison, but he gave promise of the same broad shoulders, together
  with better proportions and, throughout, a fine workmanship of which there
  was little trace in either his father or mother. He was their first-born,
  coming in those days when the words "my wife" still were strange on the lips
  of William Garrison, and when the girl had not yet left all the life of Molly
  Doane behind her. They hunted reverently for a name, and at last chose Lee
  because his grandfather had fought at Antietam and Chancellorsville and
  Fredericksburg, wearing the gray. They looked on Lee with a quiet worship.
  When the other babies flooded the house with noise and care, they had less
  time for him, but his place was never usurped. The terror, the pain, the joy
  were all new with him, and the first note could never be quite repeated.
  Besides, he was different in many ways. All were fine boys, and Paul and
  William, Jr., probably would be even more huge than their father. They
  already out-topped Lee, but he was the choicer mechanism, the rarer spirit.
  Sometimes his mother thought, inarticulately, that the bloom of their youth,
  their first great joy, their hopes and dreams, had all gone into the body and
  soul of Lee. The eyes of the seven were straight and clear and misty with
  good health, but the eyes of Lee held both a black shadow and a light that
  were his alone. Even when he had been a tiny fellow he seemed to be thinking
  more than he spoke, and she had had an odd feeling that he often judged her.
  Therefore, she both dreaded and loved him. He was not demonstrative,
  otherwise his father would have idolized him. For the rest, he was the
  laziest boy in Waybury, rumor said. Books had been his world for five years
  now, but, although his father and his mother often lectured him about this
  all-consuming passion, they secretly respected it and hoped for great
  things.</p>

  <p>He turned over his situation calmly, for he had swept through so many
  crises in books that he had little enthusiasm left for the troubles of real
  life. His mother was accusing him bitterly. It would have meant a hard
  thrashing, if any of the other boys had been the culprit, but his father had
  always had a strange aversion for caning Lee, and now the worst he could
  expect would be imprisonment in a dark room without supper. That was the
  usual punishment, for he wisely never had let them know that it was almost as
  pleasant to dream in the dark as it was to read in the light.</p>

  <p>"Lee!" called his father. On his way downstairs he heard his mother
  reiterate: "I just told him to chop some kindling. Then I sat down for a
  minute and somehow&mdash;I don't know just how it happened, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That'll do, Mother. The point is, supper ain't ready, and Lee's to blame.
  I got to eat, if I'm goin' to work, don't I?"</p>

  <p>"Hush up, William. Do hush up, or Lucy Ganning'll hear, and it'll be all
  over the neighborhood in a jiffy." Lucy Ganning was a shrewd-eyed spinster,
  living across the street.</p>

  <p>"Damn Lucy Ganning!" cried the father. "Come here, Lee!"</p>

  <p>The kitchen was in deep shadow, and to Lee, coming down the stairs, it
  seemed as if his father towered to the ceiling. The soot of the forge was
  furrowed by perspiration; it was an ugly mask, rather than a face, the eyes
  looking out through holes rimmed with white. His father's great black hand
  crushed Lee's shoulder and lifted him from the floor.</p>

  <p>"Now," said William Garrison, fighting to control himself, "tell me the
  straight of this."</p>

  <p>"He slapped his book shut and made as if he was coming down," cried the
  mother. "I went and sat down.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lee hunted swiftly for a convincing lie, and told the truth.</p>

  <p>"I just stopped to finish the page, Dad, honest. And then a minute later
  you came home."</p>

  <p>His mother laughed hysterically. "Will you listen to that? Look at the
  stove. It's cold, ain't it? It's been two hours long, that minute of
  Lee's."</p>

  <p>"D'you think I'd lie? Dad, it wasn't hardly more'n a minute."</p>

  <p>"Lee, how d'you dare say such things? And there he sat all day upstairs,
  never offering to help me, while I was breaking my back with that boiler,
  and--" Her voice shook; she became mute with self-pity and rage.</p>

  <p>"So that's what you been doin'?" said William Garrison. Lee looked sharply
  at his father and for the first time in his life was really afraid. The big
  man spoke quietly, but he spoke through his teeth, and he seemed a stranger.
  Through the dining-room door Lee saw seven white faces&mdash;little Jerry and
  Peter, twins, were clasping each other in terror.</p>

  <p>"You been up there with your books! Your mother was down here slaving. I
  was up to the forge with fire in my face!"</p>

  <p>They were silent, looking at each other, until Lee saw that his father was
  trembling.</p>

  <p>"William," whispered the mother, "William, what d'you aim to do?"</p>

  <p>"Close that door!"</p>

  <p>She stared at him a moment and then went silently and shut the door across
  the seven white faces. She came back and reached out her hand, but she did
  not touch her husband with it.</p>

  <p>"William," she whispered again.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to teach him."</p>

  <p>She fumbled and caught the back of a chair.</p>

  <p>"Don't look that way, Mother," broke out Lee. "I'm not afraid."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" she cried, but William Garrison had balled both his great
  fists.</p>

  <p>"You don't fear me, eh?" he said, grinding out the words. "Well, by
  heaven, you will fear me. D'you hear that? My own son don't fear me!" It was
  not the voice of his father so much as his mother's eyes that froze the blood
  of Lee. She kept looking into her husband's face, fascinated, and Lee began
  to feel that all this time she had known mysterious, terrible things about
  William Garrison and concealed them from the world.</p>

  <p>"Come here!" The big hands clamped on Lee's shoulders and wrenched them
  about. "Listen to me. I been lettin' you go your own sweet way. That's ended.
  You're no good, and you're comin' to no good end. I'm goin' to make you or
  break you, and I'm goin' to do it now."</p>

  <p>There was no doubt about it. It meant a thrashing, and Lee wondered if he
  would scream as the others screamed. The thought made him sick. He wanted to
  die before the test came.</p>

  <p>"William," said his mother in that same terrifying whisper, "it wasn't
  much he done wrong." The big man only turned his head and looked at her, and
  his fingers worked deeper into the shoulders of Lee. "I'll get the switch,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>"Switch? Switch nothing!"</p>

  <p>She was upon him with a cry, her hands clutching at the breast of her
  husband.</p>

  <p>"William, you ain't goin' to touch him? You ain't in the right way for it.
  You&mdash;you'll&mdash;kill him. My baby!"</p>

  <p>"Molly, you go sit down."</p>

  <p>She wavered, and then dropped into a chair and hugged her face in her
  arms.</p>

  <p>"Don't do it, Dad," said Lee. "Don't you see? She can't stand it."</p>

  <p>His father blinked as though a fierce light had been flashed in his
  face.</p>

  <p>"Good heaven!" groaned Willliam Garrison. "A coward, too!"</p>

  <p>By one hand he still held Lee, and now he turned and strode out of the
  kitchen and down the back steps, dragging the boy. He threw back the cellar
  doors with a crash and went down with Lee carried in front by the scruff of
  the neck. Below it was almost night, and now that the dimness covered the
  face of his father, Lee, standing in the corner, felt the horror slip from
  him. He remembered that worried, gentle face that had leaned above him when
  he had had scarlet fever.</p>

  <p>"Dad," he said, "I'm not afraid, but wait till tomorrow. It's worse on
  Mother than it is on me."</p>

  <p>"The devil!" said William Garrison hoarsely, and he caught up a billet of
  wood from the floor. That voice told Lee plainly that he had to do with a
  stranger, an enemy. He looked about him, and in the corner stood the wooden
  sword that he had whittled when he first read the story of Excalibur. He
  caught it by the flimsy hilt.</p>

  <p>"I give you warning," he said in a high, small voice, "I'm going to fight
  back."</p>

  <p>"You are, eh? Come here!"</p>

  <p>Out of the dark a hand reached at him, but he struck it away with the
  wooden sword. That first blow was the last; Excalibur snapped at the flimsy
  hilt. A great black form rushed on him. He was whirled about. A bruising,
  cutting blow whacked on his shoulders. Lee could have wept with joy, for the
  pain, instead of leaping out at his teeth in a shriek, traveled inward, a
  deep, silent hurt. There was only the sound of the blows, the harsh breathing
  of his father, the staggering impacts, and shooting, burning pains.</p>

  <p>A pause with lifted hand. "Have you got enough?" gasped out William
  Garrison, and a great sense of unfairness rushed through Lee and made tears
  come in his eyes. He was not being punished; he was being fought as a grown
  man fights an equal, and all his fine boy's sense of fair play revolted. If
  he could have spoken, he would have defied the giant in the dark, but he
  dared not open his lips for fear of the sobs that made his throat ache.</p>

  <p>"Have you got enough?" repeated William Garrison, thundering. Then: "I
  guess that'll do you for a while." He seemed to grow sober at a stride. "Son,
  I thought you was a coward&mdash;maybe I was wrong. You stay here and think
  it over&mdash;what you done and how you lied&mdash;I'm coming back later
  on."</p>

  <p>Mr. Garrison disappeared up the steps, the cellar doors crashed shut, and
  the padlock snapped. At that Lee forgot his pain.</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't trust me," he whispered to himself. "He wouldn't trust me. He
  locked me up like a dog that's been whipped."</p>

  <p>Lee shook his fist in a silent fury of shame and hate, and then sat down
  to think. Vital, deep emotions did not last long in Lee. His edge had been
  taken by romance, his sensibilities blunted, but, as he heard the noise of
  supper preparations begin over his head, he was sure of one thing&mdash;he
  would not face his seven brothers in the morning and see their half-sheepish,
  half-mocking grins. He was like them, now&mdash;something to be beaten into
  obedience. Then there was a deep rumbling&mdash;his father's laugh.</p>

  <p>He could not believe it, for a time. Then silverware jingled faintly. They
  sat at the table; they had forgotten.</p>

  <p>"And I'll forget you!" said Lee in a burst of sorrow and choking shame.
  "I'll forget you all, forever!"</p>

  <p>It was a simple matter to escape through the cellar window, which, of
  course, his father had forgotten, and it was equally easy to steal across the
  kitchen floor while Paul was telling a noisy anecdote about the school. His
  voice covered the sound of Lee's steps, but through the dining-room door Lee
  saw his mother's sad face, and he blessed her for it.</p>

  <p>Once in the room that he shared with three of his brothers, he lighted the
  oil lamp and swiftly set about making up his bundle, for he knew exactly what
  should go into a bundle when one leaves home. He remembered what Billy had
  taken in The Adventures of a Young Miner and all the important things that
  the hero had forgotten. In five minutes his bundle was completed, and he was
  on his way downstairs.</p>

  <p>He stopped at the foot of them to listen. If there had been one word for
  him, one syllable to show they missed him, he would have turned back, but
  they were all exclaiming about something he did not understand, and Lee went
  out into the night.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE STAKED PLAINS</h2>

  <p class="first">There are some who alter little between youth and manhood,
  and Lee Garrison was one of these. He was thirteen when he curled up in the
  corner of a freight car and awoke a little later with the wheels jolting
  beneath him. A dozen years later, if anyone from Waybury had come across a
  certain tanned line rider in the Llano Estacado, he would probably have
  recognized Lee in spite of sombrero and chaps. His shoulders had broadened to
  the full of their early promise. His face was little changed. At thirteen he
  had looked much older than his age; at twenty-five he seemed much
  younger.</p>

  <p>Most cattlemen have to hold themselves to the monotony of their work by
  steady effort, consciously tensed to be prepared for little things, straining
  their eyes across miles of shimmering sand to watch the herds and mark the
  sick or the strayed, until the crowfoot wrinkles come, the brows draw down.
  Boys acquire a grim, wistful expression that should not be theirs until
  middle age. But Lee Garrison was not one of those who fight nature. He
  accepted it. His nearest approach to the alert was quiet watchfulness like
  that of the dog that sees the rabbit but prefers hunger to the long race in
  the heat. No doubt this accounted for Lee's unwrinkled forehead. From a
  distance he appeared calmly dignified. At close hand his face was rather a
  blank, except for the occasional swift play of his eyes, and the Southwest,
  that has not time to ponder over idiosyncrasies or exceptions, put down Lee
  Garrison as a lazy man and filed him away in its memory under that
  heading.</p>

  <p>Even granting the celebrated vacuity of Lee's mind, men wondered how he
  could stick to line riding. Hour by hour, day by day, week by week, month by
  month, he journeyed up and down a hundred miles of fence, never visited
  except by chuck wagon, and traveling to the ranch house, fifteen miles away,
  only on state occasions. Even at roundup time, when he could have made his
  five dollars and head as a bronc'-peeler, he chose rather to keep up that
  deadly routine that drives more sensitive cowpunchers mad. Always he was
  loading down the fence with that infinite line of posts fogging into view,
  dipping now and again into a hollow, or swaying in or out to avoid a rock,
  but usually only a line that went straight across a flat earth, a string of
  heads dwindling and bobbing up and down to the trot of his horse.</p>

  <p>Twelve hours a day he kept the saddle with hammer, nail, pliers, wire
  stretcher, and boot sack full of staples. The posts were old, the staples
  worked loose, and it was a continual mounting and dismounting, a blow with
  the hammer, a staple sent home, and then back into the saddle again, only to
  see a strand sagging a dozen yards ahead. Off again, on again, all day, every
  day&mdash;the patience of Indians themselves often gave way to gibbering
  idiocy after a few months of this labor, but Lee Garrison held out. He stayed
  by preference. One might have thought that he loved the quiet and nature as
  the old trout fisher loves it&mdash;but the Staked Plains! Countless Spanish
  daggers were all that showed above ground level. There were not mountains
  rolling against the horizon, cool and blue. For life, therefore, the prairie
  dogs.</p>

  <p>It was one of those that made Lee pause in the very act of lifting his
  horse into a canter to head for the nearest of his dugouts, for it would be
  dark by the time he had finished his supper and haste was needed. But the
  prairie dog stood by his mound, looking like a miniature beaver, his tail
  jiggering up and down with the fury of his barking. A companion jumped out of
  the hole and joined in the defiance.</p>

  <p>"Sassy little devil," murmured Garrison, and jerked out his revolver. The
  bullet merely knocked a spray of sand over the prairie dogs as they whirled
  toward safety.</p>

  <p>It was a result that Lee had small time to observe, for his horse leaped
  straight into the air and came down stiff-legged, swallowing his head. Past
  five posts he bucked with educated viciousness, but at the sixth he tossed up
  his head and looked back at the rider as though asking pardon for such folly.
  Even a painful jab of the spurs only made him switch his tail and break into
  a perfectly measured lope. The face of the rider, that had lighted for an
  instant, now went blank again.</p>

  <p>"Of all the no-good horses I've ever seen," said the master, "you're the
  worst and the yellow-heartedest, Pinto. When you came out to me, I had hopes
  for you."</p>

  <p>The pinto cocked a wary ear back and turned the corner of a red-stained
  eye.</p>

  <p>"But," concluded the line rider, "now you can't pitch enough to make
  conversation."</p>

  <p>Yes, he undoubtedly could ride as well as the next man, but as a marksman
  he was distinctly ordinary. But the sigh he heaved was not on account of the
  missed shot. It was what that miss signified. When he first arrived in the
  cattle country, his boy's mind had been filled with the glamour of it, and he
  had begun to school himself to be a model knight of the plains&mdash;expert
  rider, shot, and cattleman, knowing all the desert and the creatures of the
  desert. Only in one ambition had he succeeded&mdash;he could stick in a
  saddle as though he were glued to the leather&mdash;and all his other
  aspirations were so long dead that the thought of them barely served to
  awaken in him a faint melancholy regret. So an old man sighs as he thinks
  back to the star-storming aspirations of his youth.</p>

  <p>At the dugout he unsaddled his horse and hobbled him carefully, for
  Pinto's chief talent and ambition was to break and run for the ranch house
  fifteen miles away.</p>

  <p>Next he prepared his supper from the food cached in the dugout, and within
  an hour after his arrival he had cooked and eaten his supper and spread his
  bed.</p>

  <p>It was a gray, cold evening, more like January than March, and the high
  mist that was hardly noticeable during the day now shut away the color of the
  sunset, and the sun went down red. The prairie dogs no longer chattered, but
  a bull bat sat on the nearest fence post wailing at him like a whippoorwill,
  and twice a prairie-dog owl, hunting close to the ground, skimmed past the
  dugout, a living shadow, uttering the sad cry that always seems to come from
  a great distance.</p>

  <p>Lee Garrison made himself comfortable in the dugout, lounging with a
  saddle for a pillow, and a clean lantern ready behind his head, although it
  was not yet dark enough for artificial light. Behind him lay three books that
  he touched after the manner of the after-dinner smoker, fingering his cigars
  and considering which flavor he will choose. It was some time before he made
  up his mind, and, indeed, to a lover of this sort of reading there was little
  measure of preference among three such fountainheads of romance as A Thousand
  Nights and a Night, Boccaccio, or Malory. These were his treasury, of which
  he never wearied, each of them inexhaustible in incident, thronging with
  pictures.</p>

  <p>But he suited his daily selection to his mood, having sometimes a taste
  for the voluptuous adventures of the Arabian tales, and often for Boccaccio,
  wicked, delightful, chuckling at sin and even smiling at virtue, but most
  frequently, as on this evening, he chose Le Morte D'Arthur. It was his first
  love among books and would remain his last, for although A Thousand Nights
  and a Night might cloy him, or Boccaccio grow tiresome, he never lost his
  passion for those whom Malory keeps alive in sword and armor at Whitsuntide
  in Camelot, or at the gate of some dark castle in the forest. He sometimes
  found the Nights over-rich and Boccaccio flat, but never the style of Malory,
  rippling alike over great and small, monotonous sometimes, delightfully
  archaic, but with phrases here and there like sword thrusts, and whole
  passages of exquisite harmony.</p>

  <p>Again on this night it was Malory. The ragged covers opened, the pages,
  chipped at the corners, yellowed, stained, slipped away of their own accord.
  In ten seconds he saw the knight with the covered shield send Tristan
  hurtling out of his saddlea mighty fall! And he rolled thrice over, grasping
  his hands full of dirt each time. Lee Garrison followed the fight with
  motions of his clenched right hand.</p>

  <p>Such was his absorption that he heard neither the rattling approach of the
  chuck wagon nor the long "halloo" of the driver. Not until Baldy stood at the
  door, filling it, and his shadow fell across the book, did Lee look up.</p>

  <p>"What I'd like to know," shouted Baldy, without other greeting, "is why
  the devil you don't have regular stopping places regular times. I started
  this morning right after chow, and I been on your trail ever since."</p>

  <p>"Sorry," said Lee, and, although he lowered the book, his forefinger kept
  the place.</p>

  <p>No human being had come that way in four weeks, and Baldy knew it.
  Therefore, he pushed back his hat, and his head was as red as his face, while
  he considered whether or not this indifference were an insult, and if he
  should take it up as such. He debated, glowering upon the bent head of Lee
  Garrison. But, after all, it was a man's privilege to sit silently like a
  fool owl on a post when a chance for conversation came his way. In a word,
  the line rider was a nut, and not to be judged according to the standards of
  ordinary men. Baldy turned on his heel and without further attempt at speech
  unloaded his cargo and dumped it beside the dugout.</p>

  <p>"What do you want next time?" he snapped out, when the last box was
  deposited.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," answered Garrison, and then roused himself a little. No matter
  how odd a man may be in Texas, he cannot safely forget all obligations of
  hospitality. "Maybe you're hungry?" he suggested lamely.</p>

  <p>"I ain't."</p>

  <p>"Or needin' a smoke?"</p>

  <p>"I ain't."</p>

  <p>It gave Baldy infinite satisfaction to demonstrate his own powers of
  curtness.</p>

  <p>"Or thirsty?"</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>"There's some water.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Water? The devil!"</p>

  <p>Garrison sighed with relief and returned with pacified conscience to the
  book. Here Baldy remembered in the nick of time the most important detail of
  his errand to the line rider.</p>

  <p>"I brought out another hoss for you," he said.</p>

  <p>There was no answer.</p>

  <p>"Nice sleepy ol' hoss," continued Baldy invitingly.</p>

  <p>He himself and five others of the outfit had been pitched from the saddle
  by that same dull-eyed outlaw and now, as usual, the foreman sent his
  intractable mount to the line rider. For it was a well-established and
  significant detail of Garrison's reputation that he had never been thrown, at
  least not to the knowledge of those who had seen him work for five years on
  the Llano Estacado.</p>

  <p>Baldy looked back at the old, brown horse that stood with drooping head
  tethered behind the wagon. Its lower hip hung pendulously, and it slept where
  it stood, but at the sight a sharp pain ran through the left shoulder and hip
  of the cowpuncher, and his face puckered at the reminiscence. He would have
  sold his shop-made boots for a quarter to see this silent fool in the saddle
  on yonder brown horse. He would have given away his vast sombrero with a
  joyous heart, if he could have driven back to the ranch and told the boys how
  the dummy was thrown on his head. But Garrison had heard the news without
  stirring.</p>

  <p>"Ol' hoss is tied up behind the wagon right now," went on Baldy with
  insidious smoothness. "Which you wouldn't mind having him handy for saddling
  like that, would you? No work roping him, nor nothing. He's jest all
  handy."</p>

  <p>The import of this drifted into the consciousness of Lee Garrison. He put
  down his book with a sigh, lifted his saddle and bridle, and climbed from the
  dugout. As for Baldy, he masked a smile by rubbing the back of his hand
  across his mouth while he made his eyes wide, childishly innocent. The brown
  horse was one of those rare outlaws that has not the slightest objection to
  the weight of a saddle. Lee Garrison, with his saddle over his arm, paused in
  front of the sleepy head and looked long and earnestly at the new candidate
  for his string.</p>

  <p>"Does he guess?" whispered Baldy. "Pray heaven, he don't guess. He
  don't."</p>

  <p>This last came in the nature of an outburst of thanksgiving, for the line
  rider stepped carelessly to the near side of the brown and tossed his saddle
  upon it with such lack of precaution that the stirrup rapped the ribs of the
  horse loudly. But the outlaw only canted one long, mulish ear forward and
  opened the opposite eye. Baldy quivered with silent delight.</p>

  <p>"Don't let there be no warning," he continued in solemn invocation. "Let
  'er hit like lightning at noon."</p>

  <p>The dummy had foot in stirrup, and now it came&mdash;a creaking of
  leather, a snort, a winged leap into the air, and then came the thudding
  impact of four hoofs with four stiff legs above them and an arched back
  topping it all. The brown horse came down with its head between its forelegs,
  a pyramid, with Lee sitting on the apex.</p>

  <p>After that Baldy snatched his hat from his head, twisted it into a knot,
  and flung it on the ground. He went through odd motions, swaying from side to
  side, stiffening suddenly, jerking his hands in, pitching them out, like a
  cheerleader rousing a rooting section to frenzy, pushing the home team over
  the goal line. Presently he stood frozen in his last awkward attitude, his
  face illumined with that mysterious light of beatification that Rafael keeps
  playing about the eyes of his cherubs.</p>

  <p>"My heaven," whispered Baldy reverently. "My heaven."</p>

  <p>The evening went rapidly into the twilight, the prairie dogs came out to
  watch, the bull bat sat silently on the fence post. Then the unrhythmic beat
  of hoofs ceased.</p>

  <p>"It's true," gasped out Baldy. "I seen it&mdash;with my own eyes."</p>

  <p>The line rider came back, passed the driver of the chuck wagon without a
  word, brushed the perspiration from his forehead, sat down, sighed, and
  picked up his book as one in a dream. Baldy gaped at him, and then he walked
  away so softly that one might have said he went tiptoe over the sand.</p>

  <p>When he started on the homeward journey, he took the brown outlaw back
  with him.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; JOHN RAMPS</h2>

  <p class="first">The lantern burned clearly, and Garrison was content. Before
  him stretched a lengthy maze of adventures, jousts, waylayings,
  challenges&mdash;half a dozen full evenings of readings before he came to the
  quests for the Holy Grail and the breaking of that peerless fellowship of the
  Round Table. So Lee, rich in the prospect, stretched himself at the loaded
  board. He could never see in the Grail a sufficient cause for the ruin of the
  Round Table. Therefore, he always approached that section of Malory with a
  fallen heart, but tonight he was reading of the crisp early days when Camelot
  was a new name. He raised his head from the book only once, and it was only
  to feel the settling down of utter night.</p>

  <p>For he had learned that there is an instant of white magic just at the end
  of the evening. Perhaps it is the time when the creatures that see in the
  dark come into their own. That moment had come, when Lee lifted his head. The
  silence that camped on the Staked Plains became a listening thing with a
  heartbeat somewhere in it. The breeze lifted the corner of the page like an
  invisible finger. So ended the dull day, and the night began with a
  breathless pause as when a door opens, but those within are not yet seen. The
  world died with the day, and the people of the books sprang into life. Ladies
  who, in the day, were bland names, became on such a night brilliant realities
  with infinite lives of smiles and glances. About the lonely castle he now saw
  the wilderness sweeping in green waves like a sea, covering the walls with a
  spray of vines. So solemn became the illusion of that moment that the figure
  that loomed in the doorway and stood there, swaying, seemed only an intruder
  in the dream.</p>

  <p>Between an American Indian and an Arthurian legend, however, there existed
  a gap sufficient to shock Garrison into wakefulness. It was a
  broad-shouldered, bowlegged fellow in moccasins, with a hickory shirt, a hat
  set so far toward the back of his head that it pushed his ears forward, and,
  dangling to his shoulders, were two plaits of hair wrapped in red flannel,
  with a red snapper at each end. He supported himself with his hands against
  the door, glaring at the white man and leaning in as though he were about to
  leap on the prostrate figure. That illusion lasted long enough to bring Lee
  Garrison to his feet with the speed of a snake uncoiling. Then he saw that
  the poor fellow had braced himself against a staggering weakness. His arms
  shook under the weight they supported, and the glare of his eyes was that
  inward light of suffering long endured.</p>

  <p>Among the few established facts about Lee Garrison was an aversion to both
  Mexicans and Indians, but after a single glance at this man he caught him
  under the armpits and swung him down to the floor of the dugout. It was a
  dead weight that he lifted. The shoulders of the Indian gave under the
  pressure of an ugly limpness, and he remained in exactly the position in
  which Garrison deposited him&mdash;shouldering against the wall with one leg
  twisted oddly to the side and his right hand doubled against the floor, the
  weight of the arm falling against the back of the wrist. In spite of the
  fiery eyes of the Indian, Lee knew that the man was dying. He ripped away a
  stack of cans from a corner. They tumbled with a prodigious racket across the
  floor and revealed the hidden treasure, a half-emptied flask of whiskey, that
  he handed to the Indian.</p>

  <p>But the fingers in which the man tried to grasp it slipped from the glass
  as though numb with cold, and his arm fell. Garrison, shuddering at the sight
  of that mortal weakness, placed the flask at the lips of the Indian, and,
  when he took it away, the bottle was empty.</p>

  <p>"Good," sighed the other, and he had strength enough to take the cup of
  water that Lee poured.</p>

  <p>"I have stayed too long," said the Indian in an English so perfectly
  enunciated that Lee started. "I must go on again."</p>

  <p>He spread his hands on either side of him and strove to raise his body.
  There was no result, and a shadow dropped across his eyes. Perspiration
  glistened on his coppery forehead, but he smiled at the white man.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake, lie down and take it easy," said Lee.</p>

  <p>The other shook his head. There was a bubbling huskiness in his voice in
  which he explained gravely: "I am hollow inside and filled with fire. If I
  lie down, it will run into my head and burn me up."</p>

  <p>"A very good idea," said Lee quietly. "A fellow can fool fire that way,
  now and then. Give me your hand, will you?"</p>

  <p>He took the languid wrist. The skin was hot. The pulse ran faint and fast
  as the ticking of a clock. The Indian was dying of pneumonia.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I've finished your whiskey stock," he said. "I'll bring you out
  a new supply, when I come back this way. My name is John Ramps."</p>

  <p>Lee mumbled his own name in acknowledgment of the introduction. It would
  be morning before he could go to the ranch and return with help, and long
  before morning John Ramps would be dead.</p>

  <p>"Moonshine will think I've left his trail," said the Indian. "But though
  Moonshine is clever, one can't expect a horse to know what goes on inside the
  brain of a man. He could run faster than my horses ran, and naturally he
  doesn't think I can overtake him on foot."</p>

  <p>The feet of John Ramps were clad in moccasins, worn to shreds.</p>

  <p>"Is Moonshine a horse?" asked Lee.</p>

  <p>"You don't know him? Well, this is far from his home country. There were
  eight of us with horses, when we took the trail of Moonshine in the Diamond
  Star Desert."</p>

  <p>"But that's in Idaho, Ramps!" cried Garrison.</p>

  <p>"Yes, a long trail. However, I'm surprised that you don't know of
  Moonshine, Mister Garrison. He's a silver-gray mustang. You've seen moonlight
  running on water? That's his color. Fire in a wind, galloping across a
  stubble field, that's the way he runs. Now I must go. All the others who have
  tried have lost. Even Handsome Harry Chandler lost. He took his best horse.
  And last he rode his black mare. But even Laughter could not turn Moonshine.
  So he thinks that John Ramps, too, has failed. He does not know that I can
  still run as fast as the wind."</p>

  <p>He lurched to his feet, but at the first step he crumpled into the arms of
  the white man, and Lee laid him on the blanket. He thought, then, that the
  end had come, for there was no perceptible breathing, but he found, at
  length, a faint flutter of the heart. He sponged the face and breast and
  hands of the man, and then sat beside John Ramps to wait for the final rattle
  of breathing. Literally, the dying man was a frame of bones loosely covered
  with skin. His mouth was fallen ajar, but to Lee Garrison there was nothing
  repulsive in the face. It took him back to the quests of Arthur's paladins
  after the Holy Grail. They must have ridden like this, day and night, wasting
  themselves to shadows, burned by their desire for one glimpse of salvation.
  Even so, the Indian and his eight companions had ridden a thousand miles,
  killing their horses under them, no doubt, until only this man remained of
  the eight. He had spurred his last mount until it died, and, then, half mad
  with weariness and the hysteria of fever, he had gone on by foot.</p>

  <p>The Indian spoke. It was not the death rattle, but a harsh phrase of
  Indian dialect. The voice went on, detached, broken, but now it spoke
  English.</p>

  <p>"Who stays to throw water, when the forest burns? John Ramps is burning
  for the horse." There followed a burst of rapid chatter in his own tongue.
  The next English words made only a few phrases: "Let her go to another
  wickiup&mdash;I cannot stay." Here he fell into inaudible mutterings, rolling
  his head from side to side, and plucking aimlessly at his breast. Then: "Be
  not afraid. It is not Tahquits, pounding the bones of a victim. The hoofs of
  Moonshine make the thunder, and John Ramps is on his back."</p>

  <p>Was it weeks, months, even years, perhaps, since John Ramps started on the
  trail of the stallion? The chase was as strange to Lee as the story of the
  Grail. It was stranger, for in the years of his riding on the ranges he had
  found in horses only creatures to be subdued by force, whipped into
  obedience, crushed with the stronger hand. A sullen anger came in him at the
  thought that a dumb beast had been able to kill this man. He felt a pang that
  one of the human race could have responded to a spark that had never touched
  him, could have risked his life with so open a hand for the sake of a
  beast.</p>

  <p>The Indian spoke again, and his voice was lower and harsher. The breath
  seemed to die between every dragging syllable.</p>

  <p>"Brothers, it was no fault in the trap&mdash;the trap was good, but he is
  like his name&mdash;he is like moonshine, and he eludes us. A man can take
  fire on two sticks and carry it through the wind&mdash;or he can gather water
  in his hands&mdash;or he can even put the wind in a bag and keep it&mdash;but
  who can gather moonshine?"</p>

  <p>The picture Lee Garrison saw was the narrow, yellow triangle of a campfire
  and eight swarthy faces, glittering by that light. A sudden shout from John
  Ramps made his hair bristle. The Indian had jerked himself to a sitting
  posture, and his face was a frenzy.</p>

  <p>"Ho! We have him. My mountain sheep, my red beauty, faster, faster!
  Hei!"</p>

  <p>Over his head he swung one arm, a gesture so vivid that the whirling loop
  of the lasso flashed like a shadow across the eyes of Lee. The hand fell, and
  the body pitched back, and Lee, leaning close over a face that was contorted
  in the last agony, heard a whisper: "He is gone!"</p>

  <p>The same whisper, it seemed, drained the last life from John Ramps, for
  almost at once a mist brushed across the fiery eyes as though the lamp that
  shone down on them had grown suddenly dim, and a gradual smile stole across
  the lips of John Ramps. Perhaps, thought the cowpuncher, the soul of the
  Indian was already flying down the trail of Moonshine and saw the
  fugitive.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE FIRST SIGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">It seemed to Lee, as he looked down to the eternal triumph
  of that smile, that the most opulent cattle kings did not build as well as
  John Ramps, for their names would last only as long as their fortunes held
  together. But John Ramps, building nothing, had left a thing that would never
  die, a story of which he was a part. He died for the sake of it, and, as long
  as men loved horses, they would not cease to thrill when they heard how the
  Indian trailed the gray stallion a thousand miles across the mountains. Here,
  in a bronze skin, was the type of a Galahad. Lee went to the door of the
  dugout. The moonlight lay in pale waves over the rolling ground outside.
  There was not a sound. He thought back a little. The cattle range had been a
  joyless place to him, a drab region, but it had at least given him escape
  from people and provided him with a great blessing&mdash;silence. As he stood
  there, he grew sad with the desire to be among men. He had lived among them
  with his eyes closed, for there must be others in whom burned the fire of
  John Ramps. Perhaps, with patient searching, he could find one such and
  buckle that man to him for a friend.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, he must bury the Indian. Here on the plains was the place
  for him, lying face up, not too far away from this same moonlight.</p>

  <p>He picked up the body of John Ramps, a withered body of bones and skin,
  and fifty yards from the dugout he placed it in a deep crevice among the
  rocks. Prying against the keystone of the overhanging boulders, he loosed and
  sent down a ponderous shower of rock. The roar of the fall filled his ears
  for a moment longer, and then the peace of the desert washed like a wave
  about him. In a nearby Spanish dagger the wind was whispering; that was the
  end. All trace of John Ramps was gone from the face of the earth, and only
  one man knew his monument.</p>

  <p>Then, as though a voice from behind bade him turn, he swung sharply and
  saw what seemed a cloud of moonlight gathered into a moving form. It glided
  over a hilltop, disappeared in the wash of shade that filled a gully, and
  slipped into view again over a closer rise of ground. It was Moonshine.</p>

  <p>If he had never heard of the stallion before, the name would have burst
  from his lips as it did now in a shout. Moonshine stopped with a suddenness
  that sent his mane tumbling forward in a flurry of silver, and stood fast, a
  creature of light.</p>

  <p>He neighed like a challenge, or a gloating over the dead man, then whirled
  and fled. Oh, the swing and lightness of that stride&mdash;like a wave in the
  free ocean! Perhaps the soft surface sand buried the noise of hoofs. Like a
  phantom the wild horse drifted over the hill and faded into the shadow
  below.</p>

  <p>He came into view again on a farther rise. Then Moonshine was absorbed in
  the heart of the night. The face of Lee Garrison was like that of one who
  struggled to keep alive in his memory a dying music.</p>

  <p>It was hard to turn back, for a power drew him down the trail of the
  horse. He closed his eyes. At once against the black of his vision the form
  of Moonshine stood out, luminous silver.</p>

  <p>He had found his passions so entirely inside the covers of books that this
  reality, taking him by the throat, bewildered him. Had the soul of John Ramps
  come into his body? It was the memory of the mustang's gallop that maddened
  him&mdash;to sit on that back would be to sit like a leaf in a level wind.
  Between his knees he could sense the lithe, strong barrel of Moonshine, and
  his face was hot with longing to feel the wind of Moonshine's galloping.</p>

  <p>He found himself in the dugout with his head between his hands. His face
  was hot. The fingers against his face were cold. His heart fluttered in a
  strange, airy manner, but, when he sprang up, his mind at least was
  clear.</p>

  <p>This note he scrawled: I got a hurry call, and I am gone. This, with some
  perishables that could not be trusted without guard in the dugout, he put
  into the saddlebags, after cinching up Pinto. When he had cut the hobble
  ropes, the little horse, true to his homing instinct, darted toward the ranch
  house. So with the bridges burned, Lee turned back to the dugout and swept
  together the necessaries. Since he had to travel on foot, he cut his list of
  essentials to the bone. In a minute, at most, he was striding across the
  sand.</p>

  <p>A cartridge belt slung over his shoulder carried his ammunition, and it
  supported at the lower end of the loop the heavy Colt .45. To catch a horse
  without a rope is nearly impossible. Lee bore thirty feet of it. A saddle
  blanket for shelter at night, some sulphur matches, a small package of salt,
  a great, powerful knife with one razor edge and another blade that defied the
  thickest tin can&mdash;these made up his pack, together with some odds and
  ends which included that prime essential of the cattle country, pliers, the
  key to the barbed-wire region.</p>

  <p>It would not have been too much to carry over even fairly firm roads, but
  the sand melted like quicksilver under his feet, for he wore the small-soled,
  sharp-heeled boots of the cattleman, that give the smallest walking surfaces.
  The heels sank deep, and in the midst of each stride there was a giving and
  slipping back. His eye had formed the horseman's habit of wandering forward
  across the landscape at the pace of a lope, and now his glances pulled him
  forward as though he were leaning against the wind. There is a quick, soft
  step for sand, barely breaking the surface as the foot falls, Indian fashion,
  but Lee was fighting ahead, slipping, stumbling.</p>

  <p>The night was cool, yet Lee in ten minutes was dripping, and he sighed in
  ardent relief as the sand shelved to a shore of firm ground. He had reached
  the Capped Rock, where, the ground having settled on one side of a fissure, a
  ridge of broken stone protrudes along a fault, and great boulders tumble from
  the plateau to the lower level. From the upper ridge he scanned anxiously the
  dimmer regions below him.</p>

  <p>Something winked far off like a bit of water exposed to the moon. The
  silvery shape dissolved in the shadows of another hollow. It seemed a mad
  thing for a man to start out to walk down a horse&mdash;and such a horse as
  Moonshine, above all. Indeed, the stallion might shake off all pursuit by one
  great burst across the country, fifty miles of running, say, that would
  effectually destroy all hopes of keeping the trail. Yet there was small fear
  that Moonshine would be so full of heart after a thousand-mile hunt across
  the mountains. The Indians had served one purpose by their long
  trailing&mdash;they had taken the edge off the mustang's wildness, and they
  had blunted his fear of man.</p>

  <p>Many times, lately, he must have had the scent of man in his wide
  nostrils, and many times he must have shaken off his horror with a small
  burst of galloping. Probably he would do the same with Lee, just keeping out
  of the danger distance. In that case there was one chance in three, the
  cowpuncher thought, of success, for the stallion would hardly have shaken off
  his pursuer and settled down to graze, when once more the man would plod
  within sight, and Moonshine must be off again, and hardly would he lie down
  to sleep when again the man scent would drift close. The gray must have slept
  on his feet, and even then he would only have an opportunity for brief dozes.
  As for Lee, he could choose his time for rest and make his sleep brief. He
  had all the advantage of the general who takes the offensive and keeps the
  opponent guessing. All of this went swiftly through the mind of the
  cowpuncher, and then he started down among the rocks.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; GUADALUPE</h2>

  <p class="first">For all the pleasant ease of the first few steps on the firm
  ground, he quickly discovered that even the sand was preferable to this
  going, for sharp-edged rocks bruised his feet through the thin soles, and
  his spurs caught and clanked on every projecting stone. Moreover, the
  scrupulously shop-made boots gave no play at heel or instep, and he lumbered
  and halted in his stride. A sensation of prickling heat about the heel told
  him that the skin was chafing away. But a snug shoe and a horse with a long
  rein, these had been his two dominant requirements for so long that he had
  come to think of his body as necessarily terminating in boots. The yipping of
  a coyote mocked him as he paused, and the barking made him think of the
  coyote's fluffy fur and how it would feel against his aching feet. The cry of
  the little hunter was coming down the wind, for otherwise Lee could never
  have come within a mile of the wanderer's acute nose, but now Lee took covert
  in a brake of scrub cedar and heard the yelping coming straight at him.</p>

  <p>The wind had blown a black slit across the hollow, and against this
  darkness the light-yellow body of the skulker appeared plainly a moment
  later. He trotted with his head low, for since the wind was at his back the
  coyote had to trust to the treacherous ground smells, distinguishing nicely
  between the new and the old, foe and friend, that which would hunt, that
  which might be hunted. Two rope lengths from Lee he stopped and stood alert.
  Whatever sixth sense warned him, the coyote let reason outweigh intuition,
  and, instead of changing his course at once, he pointed his slender nose and
  raised his cry. The bark of Lee's revolver turned it into a sharp squeak. The
  yellow body shot high, struck the earth again with an audible impact, and lay
  wonderfully limp and thin.</p>

  <p>As he ripped off the skin from the hot form, snorting the pungent odor out
  of his nostrils, Lee Garrison could only pray that Moonshine would be
  spending much of this night in sleep. The fresh pelt would be useless until
  it was at least partially dried, so he cut four small cedar branches to
  stretch the hide and fastened it securely at his back. There it must dry as
  he walked.</p>

  <p>The pause allowed his feet to puff, but after the first few tortured steps
  the pressure shut off the circulation of the blood. Presently all feeling
  ceased below the ankles. There was only the ache of leg muscles protesting
  against this unaccustomed exercise.</p>

  <p>He went on. The soreness grew. The aches accumulated and sprang out in
  surprising places. But he set himself a measured pace and kept at it with
  monotonous effort. He felt certain that the stallion must have followed a cut
  through certain low hills, far ahead, and to this goal he pointed. If pain
  were the price of Moonshine, he was beginning to pay in generous
  installments.</p>

  <p>Now black mountains began to grow out of the horizon, seeming to drift
  toward him. The sky turned from full silver to a ghostly mist, fog
  colored&mdash;dawn was coming. With that, weariness struck him squarely
  between the eyes, and he knew he must make a halt.</p>

  <p>Skirting into a cedar brake, he saw the nervous head and topknot of a blue
  Mexican quail, and shot it. He dressed the quail swiftly and placed it over a
  fragrant flame of cedar branches. As long as he could, he endured the odor of
  the roasting meat, and then he devoured his meal, half raw.</p>

  <p>The day was quickening now, the sky blue, the east fresh with color. A few
  breaths of that keen, clear air drove the ache of sleeplessness from his
  brain, and he started again toward the pass among the tumbling hills.</p>

  <p>In the firm sand of the pass he found the small prints of Moonshine as
  clear as print on a white page, and, with his revolver, he measured the steps
  accurately, scratching the odd distance on the barrel of his gun. By this
  measure, better than by any other method, he could identify the stallion's
  trail. As he hurried on, it seemed to Lee that out of the prints before him
  the body of the horse arose and drifted before him with rhythmic pace.</p>

  <p>During the day he halted only twice, for, after a pause, it became more
  than a man could endure to step again on those agonizing feet. That
  straightforward progress brought a reward, however. He came on Moonshine
  beside a water hole near plenty of long grass which the stallion was eating
  so eagerly that Lee guessed how famine pinched him. For his own part, as the
  gray raced off into the evening, he had barely strength to stagger to the
  edge of the hole. There he dropped into the mud and drank the lukewarm water.
  Afterward, it was vain to attempt to drag his boots off over those swollen
  feet, so he cut away the leather below the ankles and tossed spurs and all
  far off. One glance at his feet, and he buried them in the mud. It was a
  green slime, unspeakably soft, cool. It drank up the fever of his blood; it
  cleared his head; it drained away the thousand aches while he lay flat on his
  back, breathing with a hoarse rattle of content, his arms thrown out
  crosswise, staring up at the evening sky where the colors were mingling
  softly and gaily.</p>

  <p>There, with his feet in the mud, he took the half-dried skin of the coyote
  and fashioned moccasins. A double fold of skin made the soles. The uppers
  were crudely shaped and joined to the sole with a strip of sinew passed
  through holes which he cut with his knife. That done, in the gathering
  darkness he lay back and waited until a blue quail came fearlessly to the
  water and killed it.</p>

  <p>It was painful going in the morning, but he kept at it gingerly along a
  trail that was as clear as if it had been stamped out. He reached the Pecos
  country that day, with the great brown mountains growing up beyond to the
  white snow that topped Guadalupe. The rolling land swept into a great vega,
  and in the midst of it he stumbled upon the river. A few rods back it was not
  visible. When he reached the famous stream, he found little three-foot banks
  hemming in a swift, muddy current no broader than a street. He forded that
  bitter water at the Delaware Crossing and went on into a sandy country.</p>

  <p>The sign led toward Guadalupe until at night, at the base of the great
  mountain that now filled a quarter of the sky, the trail swung sharply to the
  right. It made Lee Garrison draw a deep breath of relief. Moonshine had
  traveled swiftly that day, and now he must lead by many a mile, but by that
  veering of the tracks Lee knew that the mustang was taking the ravine to the
  right in order to cut into the heart of the mountains. That would lead him
  about on a winding course, and Lee, going straight over the shoulder of the
  mountain, might cut across the path before Moonshine came up with him. For
  that reason he decided to eat his supper, if he could find game, rest a brief
  time, and then press straight over the shoulder of the mountain.</p>

  <p>Luck gave him his game in the form of a white-tailed buck that stood out
  of the short brush against the skyline not two hundred yards away. Lee
  stalked him as silently as a snake, and, coming up out of the gully, he fired
  from below and dropped the deer with the first shot. It was a fine
  eight-point fellow, running close to one hundred and fifty pounds, but all of
  him went to waste except the plump hindquarters. Off one of these Lee cut
  himself a huge steak and broiled it over cedar coals, a meal for a king.
  While he smoked his cigarette afterward, he watched the falling night across
  the plains below, while above him the air whispered through evergreen boughs,
  and that nameless keen fragrance was blowing. His body ached when he thought
  what a bed those piled branches would make. But when the butt of the
  cigarette was tossed away, he paused only long enough to massage his sore leg
  muscles with his knuckles, fasten the untouched quarter of the buck across
  his shoulders, and then he pressed on up the slope.</p>

  <p>At midnight he reached a crest that seemed closer to the stars than he had
  ever been before, but they were visible for a moment only. A freshening wind
  was carrying great burdens of clouds across the sky, and the stars were
  flicked out, one by one. In the redoubled darkness the voices of the wind
  crowded close to him with lonely wailing, but Lee armed himself against
  despondency. He glanced back of him to make sure of his direction and then
  went down the slope toward the ravine along which Moonshine must surely be
  climbing.</p>

  <p>A gust, as he started, struck him heavily, and, instead of slackening, it
  increased in stronger puffs, one crowded after the other, humming and whining
  across the ridges and plucking at Lee Garrison with fingers of ice. Below,
  the valley was black as a cave.</p>

  <p>He was too old a cattleman to become panic stricken at the approach of a
  storm, but, as he went on, he took stock of the swift falling of the
  temperature, the rapidly increasing numbness of toes and fingers, the
  prickling about his cheekbones. A true hurricane was in the brewing. A blast
  of sleet rattled through the shrubs, then clouds of snow poured about him,
  waving down like great moth wings and clothing the air to stifling with its
  density. It seemed that he would never stagger to the bottom of the first
  descent.</p>

  <p>A moment later, however, he came into that ravine which, he knew, must be
  the course of Moonshine as he crossed the Guadalupes. The level-driving snow
  literally roofed the gorge, but he could see for a little distance, up and
  down. Behind an outcropping of rock he crouched to wait, straining his eyes
  down the hollow for some sign of the stallion. It might be that Moonshine had
  turned with the gale and drifted as cattle drift, but Lee had strong faith
  that, in spite of the wind and weather, the gray would keep to his course
  like a thinking man. The cold mountains went by. Drifts of sheeted snow from
  time to time blew past him like ghosts, or galloping gray horses, and his
  heart leaped at so many false hopes that he would not believe when, out of
  the snow flurries below him, he made out a moving shape that grew into the
  mustang struggling through the storm on his journey north, steady as a ship
  that drives by compass.</p>

  <p>He slid his hand back and gripped the coil of the rope. Gallantly
  Moonshine came up the rise until, just in front of Lee, an arm of the wind
  shot sidewise and stopped the horse like a jerk of a stake rope. Lee Garrison
  shook out the noose a little. He lurched up and forward for the cast. But his
  body crumbled under the effort. The cold had made him as brittle as straw,
  for he had crouched by the rock too long. His legs buckled at the knees. The
  rope was caught by the wind and flung back into his face, while the horse
  leaped past him with a snort, almost within the reach of his fingertips.</p>

  <p>To tantalize him the more, he regained muscular control at once. The
  strong effort now sent his blood leaping. He sprang to his feet and rushed
  down the ravine, shouting, shaking the rope above his head. The storm tore
  off his curses at his lips. He stumbled and fell flat a dozen times. But he
  kept on until he heard, far away, the storm-drowned neigh of Moonshine. Then,
  with a groan, he crumpled up on a bank of snow.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; TRIAL BY FIRE</h2>

  <p class="first">That failure in the pass amid the snow, seemed as definite
  an end as the falling of the curtain on the last act of a tragedy. Yet he
  found himself mechanically plodding on through the storm with no more hope
  than one driven on a treadmill by a whip. Half frozen, feeble, despairing, he
  descended from the peak until a sudden wind tore the clouds to tatters and
  let through a hearty burst of sunshine. Garrison took it as a sign from
  heaven, and in half an hour he was singing on the northward trail of
  Moonshine.</p>

  <p>It was well that he could not look into the future. But every night, when
  he lay down, it was with a hope, and every morning, when he stood up, it was
  with a hope. He labored across the rugged Pinasco country, a continual up and
  down of ravines, wading through icy creeks up to the waist and struggling up
  a succession of weary slopes through thickets of dewberries and wild
  blackberries which the bears come down to eat. He slept short watches,
  dropping down in wet or dry, hard or soft, wherever his strength failed him,
  and wakened again by a sure alarm&mdash;a feeling of impending loss.
  Sometimes on the march he grew light-headed and found himself in strange
  surroundings, having walked miles and miles, following the trial with an
  unconscious attention. For food he had the quarter of the deer for a time,
  eked out with the wild, red haws with their crab-apple flavor, a delicious
  novelty. When the venison became rank, he killed where and what he could,
  never deviating from the sign of Moonshine in order to hunt game.</p>

  <p>So he came to the valley of the Rio Grande, gaunt, sun-blackened, but with
  a spirit edged like a keen appetite. His body was starved to lightness, but
  his eyes blazed out of a shadow as though in passing through the fire he had
  carried some of it away with him. And, indeed, never a day passed without one
  glimpse of Moonshine, a golden moment that was enough to carry him on with a
  high head. But from the brow of a mesa on the Rio Grande, on this great day,
  he had at last a long view and a clear view of the stallion. The face of the
  mesa dropped to a wild tangle of willows beneath, and from the farther side
  of the trees the gray horse trotted into the flat beside the river.</p>

  <p>To Garrison that sight of the silver beauty was as a glimpse of the Grail
  to humble Bors or the starved soul of Lancelot. Tears of joy misted his eyes.
  He brushed the moisture away to see the stallion pause, turn his head into
  the wind to reconnoiter some distant danger, perhaps, and then trot ahead. He
  aimed at a place where the river wound in an oxbow loop, a loop wide at the
  belly, but close together at the neck.</p>

  <p>Here Lee Garrison leaped to his feet and stood, trembling with a thought.
  Suppose that winding current were swifter than Moonshine anticipated, too
  swift to be forded? Then, when the horse turned from the edge of the stream,
  suppose that Lee could gain the throat of the loop and block the retreat?</p>

  <p>He slid down the face of the mesa by swinging himself from one projecting
  bush to another, or letting himself shoot down a sandy slope. At the bottom
  he ran like an Indian, weaving among the trees, until a distant sound like
  the rumbling of a heavy wagon across a bridge stopped him. It might be
  thunder, yet, as far as the eye could see, the sky was clear of a cloud.
  Moreover, there was this difference: it was not a single boom or a succession
  of noises, but a steady roar that grew in volume perceptibly during the
  moment he stood there. Then he understood. He had heard that same grumbling
  before, up some river valley, and at length had seen a solid wall of water
  rush down the ravine, tearing up old trees as it went, ripping out banks,
  filling the valley with thunder. A sudden downpour of rain in mountains might
  cause it, or the breaking of a natural dam. Suppose that speeding wave struck
  Moonshine as the stallion was swimming?</p>

  <p>As he raced out of the willows, he saw his nightmare realized. Down the
  river came a bluff-front of foam and thunder with stripped tree trunks
  jumping in it like little sticks in the hands of a juggler. Moonshine was
  galloping toward the farthest arc of the circle, thoroughly within the trap,
  for, unless he crossed the stream before that tidal wave swept past, he would
  be hemmed in by the tremendous current which followed that moving ridge of
  water. And here was Lee Garrison, pausing for breath in the mouth of the
  loop, swinging his rope and opening the noose. He heard a great rending and
  crashing up the riverbed and saw a line of willows near the bank shaved away
  and juggled like straws in the waters. Nothing could live in that torrent; a
  freak of the current tossed a long trunk into the air, javelin-wise.</p>

  <p>Even the stallion seemed appalled, but, turning to retreat, he saw Lee
  blocking that narrow pass. He stopped a moment with head high, his tail and
  mane flaunted in the wind. Then he came like a bullet straight at the man. A
  bull closes its eyes before it strikes, but a horse keeps his eyes wide open,
  and, when a mustang runs amuck, guns are in order. Dodging is practically
  impossible. Lee Garrison jerked up his revolver, caught the silver head in
  the sights, and dropped the gun. He could not shoot. He swung the lariat,
  prepared for a leap to one side as he cast the rope. The stallion came on
  like a thing made of light until Lee swayed forward to make his cast. Then
  Moonshine veered. A spray of sand shot into the face of the cowpuncher, and
  the gray was racing straight back down the loop, neighing as he ran.</p>

  <p>It had been an Indian charge, an attempt to conquer through fear, and it
  left Lee shaken and cursing with relief and admiration. But the feint at the
  man had taken desperately needed time. Now the white wall was ripping its way
  with thunder around the upper corner of the loop. A spray of white shot high
  in the air as, in its straight course down the riverbed, it smashed against
  the bank not six yards from him. The ground shook beneath him, and the roar
  stunned his ears, then, as a dense rain showered upon him, the water bank
  veered to the right and lurched along the upper side of the loop. The
  stallion ran for the ford with his head turned, watching the progress of that
  shouting torrent as it leaped and foamed and tossed the trees it had
  uprooted. Lee dropped the rope, cupped his hands to his mouth, and into the
  uproar shrieked his warning. He might as well have tried to throw a straw
  against a sixty-mile gale.</p>

  <p>The wave was rounding the upper corner of the loop when Moonshine shot
  from the bank into the muddy stream, disappeared, and came up halfway across
  the water with pricking ears. Gallantly he swam, making a wake behind him,
  but now the water about him shuddered into little waves before the coming of
  the flood. Lee dropped to his knees and covered his eyes, digging his nails
  into his face.</p>

  <p>The thundering overwhelmed even his thoughts. It filled his mind as the
  sun fills the heavens. Then it seemed that a long, hoarse cry, like the
  scream of a horse dying in agony, pierced through the roaring. Now the moving
  wall of destruction roared away, bearing his picture of the dead body,
  tumbled in the waters, to be washed on the banks far below. He dreaded so to
  look on the truth that he had to fight his hands down from his face. Yonder
  stood Moonshine on the farther bank, dripping with water, and, in the sun,
  too brilliant to be looked upon. He whirled and raced off, a flowing form of
  light. The knot in Lee's throat was loosened, and through him passed a great
  weakness of thanksgiving.</p>

  <p>He could not follow until the flood subsided. Therefore, he built a fire,
  and, pouring water into a hole in a rock, he heated it with stones from the
  fire and made sagebrush tea. In this he soaked his sore feet, and, while he
  sat there, he was deep in his tattered Malory. The tales that he read now by
  preference were those which he had once shunned with a half-physical
  aversion, the adventures of the quest of the Grail. At the end of each day's
  march, indeed, he propped his eyes open a little longer to read of Percival
  and the black horse, or how Lionel fought with Bors, his brother. Sometimes
  he looked down from his reading at his wasted brown fingers, thin as the
  hands of a hermit. At such moments he wondered at himself. This day, when he
  closed the book and rose for the trail, he had lost the hope of capturing the
  stallion, but the quest itself, if the differentiation can be understood, was
  more a burning part of him than ever.</p>

  <p>The labor or the pursuit itself grew less, for although he climbed out of
  the valley of the Rio Grande and soon struck the lofty Mogollon Mountains and
  a forest of virgin pine, he was hardened to his work. He knew how to measure
  himself, at what pace to climb, and how to save himself through the heat of
  the day for a greater effort in the evening. The sign was always fresh, now,
  for Moonshine, robbed of rest, hard pressed to find fodder as he traveled,
  weakened rapidly. In the distance Lee noted the lean rump, and sometimes he
  even saw the shadows of the ribs of starvation. It gave him a peculiar pain
  to see what he was accomplishing, and yet he pressed on relentlessly. And so
  he came out of the Mogollons and reached the lava beds.</p>

  <p>Black rock flowed to the end of the world. There were bits and even long
  stretches of glassy stuff, maddening to walk on, or rutted and ridged places
  terrible for moccasined feet. Again there were expanses like coal cinders
  made of blown glass, endless areas of petrified coke, and domes as large as
  huge haystacks as if there the molten rock had bubbled up and solidified
  before it could fall. In that black wilderness he made no attempt to follow
  the trail, but merely gave himself to a desperate effort to win across before
  night. That afternoon he recklessly exhausted his canteen and his strength.
  Yet the evening found him still struggling with bruised feet among those
  endless mounds of burned stone, and he submitted to the inevitable sorrow
  that was to come.</p>

  <p>The cinders were better for a bed than the rock. He scraped a quantity of
  them together, leveled them off, and scattered his pack upon them. But no
  sleep came to him that night. No matter how he wrapped himself, the wind that
  hisses among the rocks found its way to his skin, parching him, drying his
  throat to parchment. He forced a swallow at regular intervals to keep his
  throat partially moist, and each swallow was a greater effort, until his
  muscles ached. There seemed nothing vivifying in that wind, as though the
  oxygen had been robbed from it, so that he had to fight back a continual
  desire to open his mouth wide and gape down the air in great mouthfuls. He
  dared not do it. An instant's gulping of the cold wind would desiccate his
  mouth until the tongue puffed and cracked at last. All the night he regulated
  his breathing and fought away the panic as it surged at him. Overhead, the
  stars were bright in a dim, steel-blue heaven, and they burned down closer
  and closer, to watch him. They started the panics, those eyelike stars.</p>

  <p>Dawn came. He had prayed for it. Then he roused out of a stupor and found
  the stars dim, the sky gray. The day was beginning. He sat up, dropped his
  face between his hands, and thought. If he turned back the way he had come,
  he knew that he could last out the journey and gain the last spring from
  which he had drunk in the mountainside. If he went on, there was an unknown
  stretch of the lava flow. Unless he crossed it before darkness, he would die.
  But to turn back meant the end of all hope of taking Moonshine. Tales of the
  book drifted through his memory, knights who had quested till they came to
  the very gates of discovery, and then turned away conquered by their own weak
  hearts. At last he took up his pack with trembling hands, set a course as
  well as he could by the cool, blue Zuni Mountains south and east, and
  started.</p>

  <p>The sun came up red, huge, without heat, and, drifting a little above the
  horizon, was lost in a sheeting of gray clouds. There it stayed all the day,
  small and dim as a moon, and left the world below to a wind which had grown
  in violence during the night. Now it whined among the rocks fully in Lee's
  face. He became childishly sullen, as though the gale had been directed to
  that quarter of the compass by a personal malignancy. Worst of all, it forced
  down his nostrils a stinging dust that was invisible to the eye but burned
  his throat and stifled him with a peculiarly pungent odor. Several times he
  had to turn his back to the wind to take an easy breath.</p>

  <p>By the middle of the morning the gale had increased, but it ceased to take
  any scruple of the thoughts of Lee Garrison. His mind was fully occupied by a
  morbid study of the thirst that burned in him. In the first hour of walking,
  his tongue had begun to puff, and the effort of keeping his mouth closed
  nearly stifled him, but worse than that was the torment of swallowing. It was
  about noon, or thereabouts, that he stopped short, realizing that he could
  not swallow again. His throat was numb with the vain struggle. The panic
  which was ever just at his shoulder now leaped on him, and his reason
  staggered.</p>

  <p>Only a little more and he would plunge into gibbering idiocy. He thrust
  his hand in front of his eyes and studied the fingers as he wiggled them
  slowly back and forth. All the tortures of thirst were nothing compared to
  that fear of the insanity that comes with it. Another instant and the
  hallucinations would begin with daydreams of fountains of crystal cold water,
  of mountains of snow, of delectable berries, frosted and juicy, of endless
  bottles of icy wine. Then he would see a blue lake in the middle of the
  desert, a lake so real that the waves rolled in and broke with a shower of
  spray upon the shore.</p>

  <p>And with the dead aches in his throat he tried to occupy his mind by
  remembering long quotations from Malory, but always those quotations began to
  repeat themselves automatically, meaninglessly, and the whole force of his
  mind, he would discover suddenly, was fixed on a dream of the snowstorm in
  the Guadalupes. Ah, if such a storm should come now, he would walk with his
  head bent far back and let the great, luscious flakes pour into his open
  mouth. He would sweep them to his lips with both hands.</p>

  <p>Here his sane self wakened Lee from a trance in which he actually walked
  with his head far back, his mouth gaping wide. It had been a narrow escape.
  The perspiration started out all over his weakened body as he realized how
  close the peril had come, and he forced his bleeding feet into a run. Yet the
  thought of escape by flight was in itself madness. He stopped. He sank his
  teeth in his forearm and sucked the crimson substance. And that gave him the
  power to draw one free breath and swallow again.</p>

  <p>Out of the torture that followed he remembered two things. Once he looked
  behind him and saw that a red trail led up to him made by his own lacerated
  feet. And again there was a crisis during which he seriously considered
  lancing the swollen tongue that choked him. He balanced that thought soberly
  for a time, walking with the open knife in his hand.</p>

  <p>Coming out of another haze, he noticed that he was seeing the lava
  hummocks farthest ahead of him against a background of light gray, as the
  desert stretched before him. He shouted&mdash;it was only a hoarse, gagging
  murmur&mdash;and the black nightmare vanished. Then he dropped to his knees,
  scooped up the sand, and let it fall back through his fingers, laughing
  aloud.</p>

  <p>It was hearing that horrible, small laughter that sobered him to the
  understanding that, although sand were preferable to stone, he was still far
  from water, and ten days' searching might not find it. What would Moonshine
  himself do? He had a gift like other wild horses, doubtless, and would scent
  water from far off. On this hint he built. If he could find Moonshine's
  trail, it might lead him to safety. As well look for the paths of the stars
  in the seas, however, as try to find the trace of his footprints in this sand
  that ran like water into every depression Lee's moccasins made. A touch of
  wind washed the surface smooth again. With the soft sand easing the pain of
  his feet like a blessing, he laid his course in an S-shape, winding back and
  forth in the hope of striking a bit of firm ground that would hold the sign
  of the stallion.</p>

  <p>He found it at last in a little island of clay among the drift-
  sand&mdash;three hoof marks. With his knife he drew a straight line through
  the prints&mdash;it pointed the direction of Moonshine's flight. Even then
  his chance was small, for that direction might change, if the horse had not
  actually scented water.</p>

  <p>The sun, as if realizing that there was no longer a chance of discouraging
  the traveler with gray and cold, had broken through the clouds that tumbled
  down to the horizon. Facing a blinding sun, he struck away from the firm
  ground and was instantly ankle deep. As he labored on, the blood swayed into
  his brain each time he lifted the rearward foot. It crowded behind his eye
  until the skull threatened to split, then ebbed, and weakness ran through
  him. Between the spasms of agony of breathing and walking he felt a sort of
  divine promise that, if he endured this last test of fire, Moonshine must be
  his. He was paying in full.</p>

  <p>Straight before him something glittered, as though there were two suns,
  one in the sky and one flat on the desert. It changed to a ball of fire set
  in pale blue. A cloud drifted across the sun. The ball of fire grew dim among
  the sands. It was water, a wide, blue pool, a miracle of spring water
  brimming a hollow not fifty feet away.</p>

  <p>He went on his hands and knees until he lay at full length on the moist
  brim with his face buried in the pool.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; GOLD</h2>

  <p class="first">The sand was a tremendous handicap to Moonshine. For his
  small hoofs cut deeply into the earth while Lee merely dusted through the
  surface, so to speak. And now the horse was rarely out of sight, a glimmering
  shape struggling through the reddish-brown dirt. Sometimes, to shake off that
  slow, plodding, restless form, the stallion burst into a gallop, but a few
  minutes of it brought him back to a walk. A little later Garrison would come
  bobbing out of the skyline.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the cowpuncher was seasoned to his work. He knew to
  perfection the short step that served him best in such going. The slipping of
  his feet no longer worried him, and his leg muscles were turning to iron. He
  passed Yacoma of the Moki Indians in their strange, semi-Oriental costumes,
  with their hair bobbed over their shoulders and white cotton trousers, and
  from them, the first human beings he had seen since the long trail began, he
  bought two rolls of their Indian bread with the last of his money. His
  cartridge supply was perilously low, but food was more important than
  bullets.</p>

  <p>He had reason to bless that purchase, for a bitter country lay before him,
  swept clean of forage for Moonshine and game for man. Near Nic Doit Soe Peak
  a sandstorm struck him, a dull, reddish mist rolling up on the horizon and
  spreading until the sun itself was veiled. It had been hot, sweltering and
  still, but the temperature dropped fifty degrees in as many moments, and then
  the wind struck him with its burden of fine red silt. Only the presence of a
  sandstone butte, behind which he took shelter, saved him that day, and how
  Moonshine ever lived through it he never would understand. But when the storm
  passed followed by a heat wave, he found the horse still journeying before
  him, red, now, instead of white.</p>

  <p>After that came the Colorado, a mile-wide gulch whose rock walls were like
  banks of mist with a setting sun behind them, gray-green cliffs of diorite,
  cold granite fogs, rhyolite, an incredible lavender-pink, everywhere benches
  and slides of earth, blue, yellow, purple, brown, and farther down the caqon
  a naked cliff face of talc, dazzling white. That riot of pigments stretched
  beyond, and over miles and miles of badlands to the north, south, and west,
  with the blues of evening pooled in hollows here and there, and dimming the
  brightest red to purple. And the stream which had done this vast piece of
  quarrying? Far below, it lay like a brown chalk mark scraped across the
  rocks.</p>

  <p>Halfway down the cliff he paused to see the stallion emerge from the river
  on the farther side, the desert stain washed away, and once more a form of
  silver. After that glance he bent grimly to his work and came at length,
  panting, to the valley floor with a rush of small rocks about him. That
  sound, near at hand, almost masked a distant rattling. He threw himself
  forward, heard a sound like vast wings, and then a fall that rocked the
  earth. The largest rocks of the landslide came skipping about him, and then
  the caqon walls took up the roar of that fall. As mirrors catch and repeat
  light, so the cliffs, angling in and out, caught the long thunder of the
  landslide and sent it far away. Once it quite died out, and then some
  projecting wall sent it sharply back and made Lee glance over his shoulder in
  alarm.</p>

  <p>He was seven days in the badlands to the north before he pulled over the
  crest of the Virgin Mountains and saw the Little Muddy Range beyond. That
  valley was a rest to him, and the climbing of the Little Muddy, on the other
  side, was a small matter, but, when he dropped onto the lower plateau beyond,
  it was different.</p>

  <p>It was well into April, now, and with the later season and the lower
  ground he struck the full blast of the mountain-desert heat. Like a prophecy
  of evil, the first living creature he met was a sickly, gray-green horror
  with a flabby beavertail, a lizard body, chameleon head, and saw-teeth in its
  vast mouth. He kicked the Gila monster to death; there was a carrion feeling
  to the flesh even while it lived. That evening he pumped his last three
  bullets at an elusive rabbit for his evening meal. After that he had desert
  to travel on, and rocks or sticks to knock down his game. Ten days before
  that prospect would have stopped him short, but, now, he lived like a wild
  beast, never looked ahead further than one meal, and denied himself the
  luxury of hunger until he saw the game.</p>

  <p>The second day he wound into the Hyko Mountains with the Silver Caqon
  Range thrusting out fingers from the south, and on the third day he dropped
  over the Hyko Mountains into the Pahroc Valley, ninety miles of desert.
  Through it a cloud of dust swept and dissolved into a herd of wild horses
  that picked up Moonshine at the foot of the hills, and then swept away from
  his feeble galloping.</p>

  <p>He left the Hykos with a full canteen in the middle of the day. He reached
  Dry Lake that night, far up the valley, and found it dry, indeed. Then, with
  an empty water tin, he tramped behind the glimmering form of Moonshine down
  the road to Coyote Wells and sank beside the watering troughs after a
  sixty-five-mile march.</p>

  <p>Strength and muscle and nerve ebbed away in the time that followed. To
  White River, and White Pine Mountains, then a stretch of desert from the
  White Pines to the Buttes, and desert again from the Buttes to Hastings Pass.
  Every day he found his march smaller, every day he roused from his sleep
  later, with a heavy buzzing in his ears and a mist before his eyes. Flesh
  began to drop away from him, not superfluous fat, that had been burned away
  in the first week of his march, but the vital, necessary muscle itself. His
  step grew shorter. Yet, each morning, he braced himself and threw his head
  high like a runner entering the home stretch, feeling it impossible that the
  shambling skeleton that hobbled before him, the dull, gray cartoon of horse,
  could last out another struggle until the dark. But always there was
  something left under those bones and that flabby skin which enabled Moonshine
  to come out of that down-headed, trailing walk into a trot and then into a
  laboring gallop.</p>

  <p>It was after each vain pursuit that Lee realized he must either give up
  the pursuit or else lighten his load. Already he had thrown away everything
  except the rope, the knife, and Malory. That night he read the book for the
  last time, or, rather, he sat turning the ragged, familiar leaves. He knew
  the creases and the tears fully as well as he knew the print. That page,
  where Dinaden jousted with Palomides while Tristan looked on, was marked with
  a great brown stain of rain water, and the tournament of Lonazhep was
  obscured by half a page worn away, a great wrinkle crossed the death scene of
  Balin, when he "yede" on his hands and knees to the red knight and found that
  he had killed his brother, and the print of Lancelot's fight with Turquin was
  too dim to follow, for the book had here lain face upward to the sun through
  the whole day.</p>

  <p>The next morning Malory lay in a shallow grave beneath a rock, and Lee
  went on some vital ounces lighter, but with a mournful sense of loss.</p>

  <p>That day he pressed the mustang hard, yet his nerve was gone. He trembled
  like a woman, when his foot slipped on a rolling pebble. He no longer tried
  for short cuts. Where Moonshine went, he followed, up hill and down. He lived
  on game he could knock over with rocks, stupid mountain grouse, or sage hens,
  running clumsily. Indeed, it was when he caught up a stone to throw at a
  grouse, that he found the gold.</p>

  <p>As he raised his hand, the morning light glittered in the quartz, a rosy,
  semi-transparent rock with brownish cubes in it, and all these cubes were
  spotted and sparkling with gold. All about, the hillside sparkled with the
  outcropping that a small landslide had stripped to the sun. A glimpse of that
  hill would start a gold rush. He marked the place. Above him was a higher
  summit crested with naked white rocks. Below him a creek twisted noisily down
  a rough-sided valley and carried its foam and its talking out to a level
  lowland.</p>

  <p>But yonder, a bony gray horse paused and looked back at Lee, one ear
  pricked forward and the other flagging wearily back. A childish thought came
  to the man&mdash;suppose the mustang had purposely led past this place to
  bait him with gold. He tossed up the quartz. It flashed in a rosy streak and
  fell heavily into his palm&mdash;heavy with gold, thought Lee. Then he saw
  that Moonshine had disappeared. After he had caught the horse, then there
  would be time for the gold. He paused only to drag his belt still tighter
  about his hollow waist, and then stumbled off.</p>

  <p>Till mid-afternoon he reeled on the downpitch or labored with groans up
  the rise of those endless ridges until a voice sounded just over the next
  crest. It had the booming quality of an echo, and he imagined for a moment
  that it might be his own voice, for many times before he had been startled by
  a sound and found that it was his own singing or talking as he walked in a
  dream. But, now, on the edge of the ridge appeared a burro with flopping ears
  and patient, sagging head. Looking up from the hollow the pack seemed as big
  as the beast, a burden monstrous in the sky, and Lee felt that every knob and
  projecting corner of the pack must speak of the provisions with which it was
  jammed. Lee pictured a man newly out of town, with a store of syrup, yellow
  cornmeal, snow-white flour, and bacon&mdash;oh, miracle among
  foods&mdash;bacon! There would be plenty of sugar for the coffee, black
  coffee with soul-enchanting breath, and there would be a small box of
  assorted cookies not yet consumed. But, above all, there must be a great
  store of tobacco of all kinds&mdash;half a dozen varieties of cigarettes,
  much tobacco for the pipe, and, perhaps, even a few cigars. His brain floated
  on a bright cloud of laughter, and his eyes watered. But bitter
  disappointment cleared the dimness away, for the first glance showed that the
  man had been long, long on the trail.</p>

  <p>Yet, even if no delicacies were left in his larder, how welcome a sight
  was that great hulking body, the flapping hat of soft felt, the blue shirt,
  dull with time and dirt, and a short pipe upside down between bearded lips. A
  winged angel would not have been so welcome to Lee as the sight of that
  pipe.</p>

  <p>He stood right against the skyline with a huge arm thrown up in greeting,
  and the wind parting his black beard. He shouted a greeting, a vast voice
  that flooded about Lee and made his own weakness seem tenfold greater. He
  waved his answer, and, struggling on, he stumbled and fell upon both hands. A
  heavy boot crunched on the gravel. An arm shot beneath him, and he was jerked
  erect.</p>

  <p>"What the devil?" said the man. "Now, what the devil?"</p>

  <p>"Sort of&mdash;lost my balance," gasped out Lee.</p>

  <p>"Hmm," muttered the other, "you sit down on that rock yonder, and I'll fix
  you up some flapjacks. Damned if I ain't out of bacon and coffee, but I got a
  sack of flour left and a bit of grease. What you need is something in your
  belly, m'young friend."</p>

  <p>A flash of gray disappeared over the next ridge. Suppose the stranger had
  seen and guessed the identity of that hollow-ribbed horse?</p>

  <p>"I'm due over yonder," said Lee. "I gotta start on!"</p>

  <p>"Oh," grunted the prospector, and his glance dropped to the polished
  surface where the discarded holster had played against the trousers. There is
  only one thing that ordinarily sends a man into the mountains without horse
  or weapon. "Oh," repeated the prospector. "If that's the way of it, I won't
  bother you, but, when a gent wants to make speed, he'll save time by eatin'
  along the way. Speaking personal, which here's hoping you don't take it the
  wrong way, you look like the devil. Damned if you don't make me think of a
  pore old rambledly shaklety gray hoss that went dragging himself across my
  trail a while back. By heaven, I looked at that old skeleton and fingered my
  gun. I come near putting him out of his pain. You're like him&mdash;" He
  broke off with an enormous laugh that set Lee's nerves jumping. "Not that I
  was figuring on pulling a gun on you, too!"</p>

  <p>Far off the sun glimmered again on the stallion. He was gaining mortal
  ground every moment. Lee would not stay for food, but tobacco? He closed his
  fingers over the quartz rock that he still carried until his hand ached.</p>

  <p>"If you can give me a handful of tobacco?"</p>

  <p>The prospector flushed to the eyes.</p>

  <p>"If you're short," said Lee, "don't bother about me."</p>

  <p>"Wait," said the other huskily. He caught Lee by the shoulder as the
  latter started to turn away. "Wait a minute." He was panting in his anxiety.
  "Three days I been nursing this here pipe along, without lighting it, because
  it's all burned out, and because I got just one pipeful left. I been chewing
  the pipe stem and drawing on it, kind of fooling myself."</p>

  <p>He dug into his pocket and brought out a palm half filled with gold and
  silver coins. "I got fifty dollars here that ain't doing me no good. Here's
  half for you. You can fit yourself out the first dump you come to, but just
  leave me the bit of tobacco. Is that square?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Lee, "but I don't want your money."</p>

  <p>The flush of the other turned to a deep purple. "My name's Olie Guttorm,"
  he said. "You ask about me in these parts, and they'll tell you that I'm
  square. I'll split the tobacco with you fifty-fifty!" He dragged out a
  battered sack, secured by many wrappings of string.</p>

  <p>"Never mind," said Lee, and, to show his indifference, he tossed up the
  quartz and caught it again. "Never mind, Guttorm, I can get along."</p>

  <p>But as he turned, Guttorm caught him back and froze Lee's wrist in a
  mighty grasp, while he stared at the rock in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Rose quartz," he murmured, "and hematite of iron, and gold in the
  hematite!" His little pale-blue eyes flared at Lee. "I can see why you're in
  a hurry. I been bursting my heart over a quartzite, breaking four inches a
  day, and here you come with this!" He added humbly: "Is there much in
  sight?"</p>

  <p>"A whole hill of it." Lee spoke with his eyes on the faint horizon toward
  which the stallion must be moving. Only that wild hunger for tobacco
  auctioned him.</p>

  <p>"Guttorm, I'll give you this sample, partner, and I'll tell you where to
  find the rest of it. Will you hand me over that tobacco?"</p>

  <p>Guttorm cradled the rock in both his hard hands. The tobacco had fallen to
  the ground. "D'you mean it" he cried. "D'you mean it?"</p>

  <p>Lee stooped and picked up the tobacco. He said: "You see that hill away
  back yonder with the mountain with white rocks on top to the left? That's the
  place."</p>

  <p>A thread of doubt held Guttorm. "Are they following you that close?" he
  asked, "and you without a gun? You can't even stop for this? A whole hill of
  this?"</p>

  <p>"The sun is red on it, Guttorm."</p>

  <p>The prospector struck the burro a tremendous thwack that sent it
  scampering over the ridge. He himself followed as fast, paused on the crest,
  and waved to Lee with a shout, then dropped out of sight.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE BATTLE</h2>

  <p class="first">Before the head of Guttorm sank from sight, Lee was filling
  his pipe in such trembling haste that he dropped precious shreds of tobacco
  in the gravel. He heeded it not, for now the pipe was lighted and the first
  life-giving breath of smoke drawn into his lungs. It went so deep that hunger
  was forgotten, his brain cleared, and new energy vitalized his flaccid
  muscles. He started again in the pursuit.</p>

  <p>From the second ridge he sighted Moonshine in the hollow. With forelegs
  sprawled wide, the stallion was tearing at a bunch of sun-faded grass, and,
  when it came up by the roots, he staggered loosely. The mustang was weak as a
  fever-stricken child, and Lee Garrison grinned with a cruel satisfaction. He
  walked straight on, leisurely, until the pipe was smoked to the last cinder.
  Then, his body light with the strength of that stimulus, he cut around the
  stallion at a swift run, keeping out of sight beyond the next hill, and
  finally dropping down in a perfect covert among rocks that seemed to be
  directly in the line of the gray's march.</p>

  <p>He had barely reached shelter, when the mustang topped the ridge above and
  paused there, looking back down the trail, as if he sought for the familiar
  form of his tormentor. Moonshine was a skeleton, indeed, but his head was
  still proud. Then he came down the slope. Halfway along the descent he began
  to trot, because the steep pitch of the ground forced him forward, and he
  lacked the strength to brace back. Striking the level floor of the valley, he
  staggered drunkenly, and then he headed toward the rocks where his enemy
  lay.</p>

  <p>Lee went sick with excitement. He forced himself to look away until his
  heart stopped rioting. It was a shallow valley with the bright streak of a
  river in its midst, a river that pitched out of view in the distance and sent
  back the dull mumbling of a waterfall.</p>

  <p>A snort from the gray made the watcher look back to the horse. The
  stallion had stopped very nearby. His shoulders, once so smoothly, powerfully
  muscled, were now sharp ridges. The broad chest was hung with flabby skin.
  But now, as some alarm was brought vaguely to his mind, his neck arched, his
  ears pricked, and his eyes shone with the old unconquerable fire.</p>

  <p>Garrison waited until those drawling feet went by&mdash;an eternity of
  waiting. He had even time to close his eyes and pour forth his soul in
  prayer. The next instant he started to his feet and threw the rope, quickly,
  before the tremor in his heart spread to his hand.</p>

  <p>There was still a mysterious well from which the ruined horse drew
  strength. As the rope leaped past him, he started into a plunging gallop. How
  different from that neat-footed and lightning stride that had once been his!
  Once he would have twisted and dodged and darted away as a snipe flies, but
  now he could only pound straight ahead. The noose struck the ground, and his
  forefoot landed inside it&mdash;Moonshine was flung heavily on his side. He
  whirled to scramble again, working the rope. The lariat writhed around every
  leg, and Moonshine lay hopelessly entangled. One great struggle and then he
  was still&mdash;the quest was ended. Moonshine was captured.</p>

  <p>Lee looked down at his brown hands with a deep wonder that there had been
  strength enough in them to win such a battle. A thousand pains that had
  tortured him on the trail now burned through him again. And a thousand hopes
  were now transformed into a kingdom of victory.</p>

  <p>He stepped back to look at his prize. It was a captive body, but the
  spirit&mdash;ah, that was a different thing. The eye that he turned upon the
  man was as steady and bright as a star. For a long time they stared at one
  another before the glance of the beast wavered from the glance of the man.
  Then the gaze neither dropped nor turned, but plunged straight past and far
  off into the pale blue of the sky. A chill quivered through Lee Garrison. He
  followed that glance and saw a wavering black speck in the sky. He knew by
  the flight that it was an eagle.</p>

  <p>"Dear God," sighed Lee. "If I could make you my hoss, Moonshine!"</p>

  <p>With the shirt from his back he made a bandage for the eyes of the
  mustang. Next, he loosened the rope on the legs and allowed the horse to
  rise. Moonshine merely shook his head a little at the clinging darkness, and
  Lee cut the rope in two, using part of it for a cinch, with bits of cloth
  fastened at the sides by way of stirrups. The rest he fashioned into a halter
  with a slip noose, so that, with a strong pull, he could choke the horse. A
  rock nearby gave him a step, from which he easily swung into place on the
  back of the stallion. But Moonshine merely shuddered and was still.</p>

  <p>The time had come. Lee fixed his feet in the stirrups and tore the bandage
  away. For a moment Moonshine did not stir, then he shot from springs,
  straight up. He came down with his head lowered, his feet bunched closely
  together, and whirled like a spinning top. Only a chance kept Lee from being
  slung to the ground. Thereafter, he found himself not on a horse, but on a
  great cat, so swift, deft-footed, and serpentine was the twisting course of
  Moonshine. Clinging as he could, while the shocks numbed his brain and the
  circling sickened him, he knew that had the mustang possessed a tithe of his
  ordinary strength, no man could have stayed on his back.</p>

  <p>And Moonshine fought with the power of nervous convulsion. He reared and
  threw back. Lee flung himself clear and rolled away barely in time. The
  forehoofs of the stallion, as he twisted to his side, missed the face of Lee
  by a scant fraction of an inch. Lee ran in and scrambled to the back of the
  horse as Moonshine lurched up again. The rope had been pulled high above his
  nose&mdash;he could not be choked down.</p>

  <p>He passed in a frenzy of bucking, straightened out of a dizzy circling,
  and raced down the valley. It was incredible that this pitiful skeleton could
  run with a man on his back, yet run he did, though with a stagger in his
  gallop. He plunged into a cedar brake, and Lee, flattening himself along the
  back of the mustang, was whipped and cut by the flying branches, but he was
  still in place when they reached the open. Another scheme came to the horse.
  He bore to the left and galloped close to the wall of the cliff. A projecting
  rock edge caught Lee's trousers at the hip and ripped off a leg as cleanly as
  the bark slides from a willow twig. Providentially it did not reach his
  flesh, and he hooked his leg in front of the shoulder. But Moonshine now
  veered from the cliff and halted short with his breath coming like the wind
  through an old bellows. It was not yet surrender. His head was high, and his
  ears were pricked, as if he had lost all interest in the conflict and was
  regarding some pleasant form among the clouds. In the pause the hoarse murmur
  of the waterfall floated up the valley, and Lee remembered with a shudder the
  voice of dead John Ramps.</p>

  <p>In that direction the head of the stallion was turned, and, as Lee strove
  to drop the noose lower over the nose of the stallion, Moonshine lunged into
  a rickety gallop again. Almost at once Lee understood. He knew strange tales
  of horses who had preferred death to submission. Twice, Lee threw his weight
  back against the rope. It staggered the horse, but did not stop him. He held
  straight on where the bright rushing of the water dropped into thin air. The
  voice had grown to a deep, steady chorus.</p>

  <p>Still no thought came to Lee of throwing himself from the back of the
  gray, although he knew that this was no sham charge such as that with which
  the wise horse had striven to frighten him from the throat of the oxbow loop
  on the Rio Grande. For Moonshine, despite rickety gallop and heaving sides,
  had pricked his ears as though safety lay close before him. To him it was
  better, far better, to die than to yield at the end of the battle, and, as
  the man understood the mind of the horse, he dropped the rope so that it
  swung wildly from side to side, and, throwing up his hands, he shouted wildly
  above the rushing of the waters.</p>

  <p>A steel-bright curve like the bend of a scimitar, the river dropped over
  the cliff. Moonshine flung himself into bodiless air. It whirred past the
  ears of Lee as they fell. He looked up to the blurred blue of the sky. He
  looked down to the flash of the water beneath them, not in sorrow, but crazy
  joy, so that the cataract that drowned his senses with noise was like a
  thunderous burst of music into the heart of which they were hurtling.</p>

  <p>He gave a last look to the beautiful, brave head of the horse. Then they
  struck.</p>

  <p>He felt a stinging clap on hands and face. He shot deeply into the pool,
  thrusting farther and farther into the cushioning waters. Still he lived, and
  the rocks had not crushed him. He struck upward and lay on the surface,
  gasping, with a shower of spray in his face. A moment more and he had swum to
  the shallows, and, standing up in water no deeper than his thighs, he looked
  about him. The leap he had thought was death was beggarly small. It was not
  the distance that it fell, but the volume of the river that kept the valley
  so full of talking echoes.</p>

  <p>The stallion was far down the pool, where the current boiled out of the
  pit, and there the white form whirled in an eddy, lying on its side, and
  flashing in the sun at each revolution. Lee pushed to the shore and ran
  stumblingly over the rocks. The eyes of the stallion were closed, the tongue
  lolled out, and the swift water was carrying away thick streaks of crimson.
  Plunging into the stream again up to his waist, he caught the head of
  Moonshine in both his arms, and, inch by inch, he drew his prize from the
  thousand hands of the currents. His heel struck a shelving bank. They were in
  shoal water, but dizziness began to seize his brain. With the help of
  Providence he would give one last outpouring of his strength. The effort sent
  the blood out of his head, and a wave of darkness began at his feet, sapped
  the nerves of his knees, and swept up. He felt himself collapsing and struck
  the air with his open hands as if at an enemy. Then, with a last motion of
  consciousness, he caught at and found the head of Moonshine. He sank into
  black unconsciousness.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; THE GREATER BATTLE</h2>

  <p class="first">Half his body was immersed in the icy water, and this helped
  to call back his senses. He opened his eyes and found the head of Moonshine
  lifted above him. Moonshine living! Yes, fiercely alive, for, when he rolled
  away, the stallion snapped at him like a wolf. Sitting wearily on the bank,
  Lee watched the struggles of the gray to climb.</p>

  <p>They were helpless efforts. Moonshine was trying to drag himself out by
  one foreleg only, and naturally each effort merely toppled him heavily on the
  opposite side. Yet, he had worked himself high enough to expose the reason
  why the other foreleg hung idle. The bony outer casing of the hoof was torn
  loose from the tender flesh and the million nerves within. Exhaustion stopped
  the stallion. He lay clumsily upon one side, rearing his head up with
  indomitable courage, and defying the man with great, bright eyes, although
  his nostrils quivered with pain.</p>

  <p>Heavy-limbed, down-headed with exhaustion, Lee studied the case. Here was
  a wild mustang, willing to die rather than surrender, and, moreover, here was
  a horse so injured that even the finest doctor might not be able to heal that
  dreadful wound.</p>

  <p>He looked up and down the valley in search of help. Above them, west and
  north, ran the line of cliffs over which the river tumbled, but eastward,
  beginning with the course of the stream, a broad meadow grew up into rolling
  land and hills behind. Willows straggled along the water edge, and farther
  back were quaking aspen, cedar, and big firs and spruce as a dark background.
  Some day it would catch a settler's eye, but at the present there was no hope
  of succor, and the greatest mercy for the stallion would be quick death. He
  drew his knife, but looked upward before he opened the blade.</p>

  <p>Over the eastern hills great clouds, white and blue and shadowy, came
  tumbling up into the sky; a bird whistled near him; the world was full of
  cheer. But in that happy sky he saw half a dozen specks, floating in circles.
  The buzzards had already marked the fall of the horse. So all the
  heartbreaking labors of that trail had been to give one more victory to the
  scavengers. He started to his feet. The hot revolt gave him strength anew,
  and he hurried down to begin the battle to save Moonshine.</p>

  <p>First of all, he must give him a dry bed, and, since he could not draw the
  gray from the waters, he must draw the waters from the horse. It was not so
  very hard to do. He rolled down big stones from the bank and made a wide
  circle around the stallion. He filled the larger interstices with smaller
  stones and smooth-edged pebbles. Over the outer surface he next strewed water
  plants, and, using a section of the outer rind torn from a stump whose heart
  was pulpy and rotten, he shoveled sand and mud over all the dam until it was
  watertight. With the same rude shovel he scooped out the water within the dam
  until at last Moonshine lay on gravel and sand from which the last moisture
  was swiftly draining away in little rivulets.</p>

  <p>He was so exhausted by this time that, when he strove to speak a hearty
  word to the horse, he could only stammer out a thick-throated groan. He must
  find food at once. In the nearest cedar brake he knocked over a mountain
  grouse and roasted it hastily. While he ate, he could look down through the
  open woods to Moonshine by the river. His head had fallen, now, and no doubt
  he gave himself up for lost. He knew the meaning of the black shapes that
  circled low and lower from the sky. Perhaps he had seen others of his herd
  drop in the race, and a month later passed the whitening bones. Lee looked
  again at cliffs, trees, water, and sky, and accepted the chance quietly.</p>

  <p>He went down through the meadows where the long, rich grass was growing,
  and he tore up armfuls of it, as much as he could carry, and brought it back
  to Moonshine. But the stallion disdained food rank with the man scent. He
  lifted his head and studied a flight of clouds. But there was endless
  patience in Lee. He had not been schooled in the long agony of the trail for
  nothing.</p>

  <p>For ten minutes he sat with a tuft of succulent, white-rooted grass
  presented. And at last, with swift, sensitive lips, his eyes fixed guiltily
  upon the man, Moonshine stole a shred of the grass and gathered it into his
  mouth, jerking his head high with a snort. He even trembled in fear of the
  retribution that might overtake him, but the man, in the wealth of his deep
  and secret wisdom, smiled. He knew how great a victory had just been won. And
  to be sure, in a little time, the horse was eating neatly from the palm of
  his open hand.</p>

  <p>The next step in that struggle was far more difficult. It was to bandage
  the torn hoof, and Lee approached the task with infinite diplomacy. He
  excavated a small hole on the edge of which he wished to rest the fetlock
  joint and so suspend the injured hoof where no pressure would grind against
  the raw nerves. But when the hole was dug, how was he to move that hoof save
  by bringing his hand within reach of teeth that might crush the bones to a
  pulp? But even that terrible risk he was willing to take. He advanced, little
  by little, the hand from which the horse had eaten, and all the while his
  steady voice brought a thousand glittering lights playing and softening in
  the eyes of the stallion. When, at length, his fingers touched the slender
  leg, the gray head darted down like a striking snake, and the teeth fastened
  over Lee's forearm.</p>

  <p>But they did not close. He released the arm as suddenly as he had seized
  it, and, raising his head, he looked far off at the flashing of the sun on a
  young poplar. It was almost as though he were ashamed. But when Lee raised
  the leg gently and placed the fetlock joint on the edge of the hole, the
  relief from pain was so instant that Moonshine lowered his head again and
  snuffed at the merciful hand of the man with trembling nostrils.</p>

  <p>The worst part of caring for the hoof was no doubt passed when Moonshine
  submitted to his touch. He went on with more assurance. With his clumsy
  shovel he drove a trench from above his own dam and let down a clear,
  sparkling rivulet that he enlarged to a pool just in front of Moonshine.</p>

  <p>The washing alone filled the hour until sunset. It was work that brought
  out a perspiration of sympathy on Lee. He had to pry the loose shell away
  from the sensitive laminae, and then pour cold water into the opening. It was
  like flooding the naked nerve of a gigantic tooth, but although the horse
  dropped his head, and, although the muscle of his foreleg kept jumping, he
  did not stir his hoof.</p>

  <p>After the cleansing ended, Lee delicately, but firmly, pressed the hoof
  shell into place and bound it with supple willow bark. Around this he packed
  thick layers of the cooling clay, laid splints of fir over the clay to keep
  the hoof rigidly in place, and covered the whole with withes of creeping
  vines and another wet layer of mud. That done, he must leave the rest to time
  and chance.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>A time of hard work began. Moonshine ate voraciously, and every mouthful
  had to be carried from the meadow far away where Lee tore up the grass. There
  was his necessary bedding, also, for he could not lie continually on the
  bruising gravel. All this was in a broken season of rain, wind, and sun of
  alternate fierceness, so he built Moonshine a shelter. First he felled
  saplings with circles of fire and then fixed them up deep in the earth around
  the horse. When he bent their heads and tied them together with creepers, he
  had the frame of a wickiup upon which he laid a thatching.</p>

  <p>For his own food he skirmished with stones or stick for the clumsy, sleepy
  grouse or laid deadfalls for the birds where their established paths wound
  through the grass, baiting the traps with dried seed. Best of all he invented
  fishhooks whittled out of wing bones, and with these and a strong creeper, or
  a strand of rope, he fished successfully in the river a half mile below.</p>

  <p>He could not make these excursions long, however, for there was never a
  day when he did not hear or see evidences of mountain lion or wolf prowling
  near and waiting for their prey. Moreover, a long absence sent the horse into
  a frenzy of neighing. Even when Lee was in the meadow, plucking the grass, he
  would wait for the stallion's neigh and then answer with a high, wailing
  whistle that pierced through the heaviest wind.</p>

  <p>It was strange how swiftly and joyously the days drifted by while he
  waited for the time when Moonshine could be safely helped to his feet. He
  himself was greatly changed. Sometimes when he fished, leaning over still
  water, he saw himself masked in a savage beard with hair straggling down his
  shoulders. He was naked to the waist, and below the waist his ragged trousers
  did not reach his knees. His feet had been bare for many days, and the soles
  were horny as leather. But with hardships came perfect freedom with only one
  shadow clouding his mind, and that was the great question of Moonshine's
  hoof. When he removed the bandage he might find only a ragged, shriveled
  parody of a hoof. When he thought of that, he could not help looking into the
  sky where the buzzards still hung. His patience was great, but theirs was
  endless.</p>

  <p>It became increasingly difficult after the first few days to keep
  Moonshine quiet. He gained in strength and flesh with amazing rapidity, and,
  with the addition of vigor, he waxed more eager to find his feet. After that,
  it was necessary to pet and amuse the stallion like a sick child until Lee
  decided that he might safely get up.</p>

  <p>To ensure that safety, however, was a great problem, for Moonshine must
  get to his feet without once putting an ounce of weight upon the injured
  hoof. To prevent that, Lee made of tough vines a sling that passed over the
  withers, fastened at the elbow, and again, firmly, around the fetlock joint,
  that was drawn close to the upper leg. He now began a course of lessons,
  teaching Moonshine to rise on one foreleg, throwing part of his weight upon
  the shoulder of the man. It was prodigiously hard labor for the cowpuncher to
  take that great forward thrust as the mustang lunged up, but it was finally
  accomplished. Moonshine came swaying to his feet and hobbled out of the
  wickiup with Lee at his side, supporting all he could of the weight. The
  horse stayed up only a short time the first day. Before he became unsteady on
  his three feet, Lee had to maneuver him back into the wickiup.</p>

  <p>Inside it, Moonshine turned around like a dog in his kennel, found the
  exact old spot, and lowered himself cautiously into it. It was a triumph for
  both of them, and Lee spent an hour foolishly gathering the seeded heads of
  grasses, a work that Moonshine devoured in two or three careless
  mouthfuls.</p>

  <p>Still the end was far away, and, if the hurt hoof were exposed and used a
  single day too soon, all their weeks of effort would be spent in vain. He
  examined it with painful interest each time he changed the dressing, and
  always the hoof looked worse, for while the other three were worn down nearly
  to normal as Moonshine hobbled around on them day after day, the bandaged
  foot grew steadily and became a disproportional, hideous thing, with a great
  hard rim where the wound was knitting. But Lee knew that his eye could not
  tell him. Not until Moonshine put his weight on that foot and limped or
  walked straight would he know.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THE MASTER</h2>

  <p class="first">On top of a hill that was burned brown by the fall heat of
  summer stood Moonshine, a bright form against the blue sky beyond him. He
  went readily on three legs, now, hobbling everywhere, and even managing
  occasionally a broken canter. Each day he roamed farther, and Lee, marking
  this journey to the distant hills, mused somberly over it. For all these
  excursions were toward the north. "He's turning back to his kin," Lee
  decided. "Hoof and hide and hair, every inch of him wants to be back there
  with his wild devils." What made the conclusion doubly important was that
  this day he had determined to cut the sling and let the injured hoof strike
  the ground. He raised that keen whistle, and the mustang swung about with a
  whinny and came at the hobbling canter down the slope to him.</p>

  <p>"Old hoss," the man said, "this is your day. Either you're as free as the
  clouds, blowing yonder, or else you'll be fodder for them."</p>

  <p>He lifted the chin of the stallion and made him look up where the buzzards
  hung, waiting. Then he ripped away the covering of withes and clay at last
  and cut the sling at the withers. Down came the foot, but, as it struck the
  earth, Moonshine heeled over and barely saved a fall by lurching off on three
  feet with the lame hoof raised high. Lee Garrison closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Buzzard food&mdash;him," whispered the cowpuncher. And with his eyes
  still closed, he groaned: "Moonshine."</p>

  <p>Moonshine came at a trot, and Lee listened sadly for the bobbing break in
  the rhythm. But true and clear the rhythm of that trot was beat. He opened
  his eyes. It was true. The injured hoof was striking the ground in its
  turn&mdash;gingerly, to be sure, but regularly.</p>

  <p>"Run, damn you!"</p>

  <p>Moonshine threw himself about and stretched across the meadow at a gallop-
  -a leaping gallop, but a true one, with healed foot pounding in its turn.
  Halting, he looked back with ears pointed in suspicion, as if he had seen a
  new creature jump out of the form of his companion. But Lee neither stirred
  nor shouted; joy had closed his throat.</p>

  <p>They did not leave the old camp even then, but, day by day, they roamed
  through the hills together until the weak leg grew strong, and the long
  muscles were once more down to the shape of its fellows, with only the
  disappearing ridge to mark the wound. Then he broke camp. He threw away the
  rope, for, if it came to a battle, he could never ride this revivified
  stallion. He felt it as he stood, on this morning, beside the stallion, with
  his hand on the withers. Once before he had been on that back, but in those
  days it had been a ridge of bone, and now that hollow was filled with
  rounding, smooth muscles.</p>

  <p>"Moonshine," he said.</p>

  <p>The stallion turned his head.</p>

  <p>"This part was never written into the contract, old fellow," said Lee,
  "but the straight of it is that I figure on using your feet as much as you
  use 'em. You still got the right to have your own say and dump me on my
  head&mdash;no hard feelings, if you do&mdash;but here goes."</p>

  <p>He swung back, made a quick step forward, and vaulted onto the back of
  Moonshine. There, with his hand buried in the mane, and his knees feeling for
  a firmer hold, he waited while the strong body under him quivered, settled.
  He set his teeth for the leap straight into the air, but, instead, Moonshine
  sprang into a gallop as smooth as the run of an ocean wave. Or, freer still,
  it was as though wings buoyed him and shot him forward with wind whipping his
  face. A hill drifted past them, a valley was devoured by those flying hoofs,
  and still the flight was not abated. They shot over a hill. Below, a long
  slope tumbled east toward the red of the dawn, and the gray flung himself out
  with head lowering. Like the rush of water down smooth rock, they shot into
  the heart of the morning. To try to stop him now would be like trying to
  recall a loosed arrow. Yet, Lee stooped till the tips of the mane were
  snapping on his face and called softly. Behold! The head went up, the run
  checked to a swinging canter. The arrow had heeded the voice.</p>

  <p>In the days that followed Lee Garrison learned that no matter how easily
  the horse could be swung from side to side or halted, he continually swung
  back toward the north as a boat struggled to come before the wind. At last,
  feeling that the test must come sooner or later, he let Moonshine follow his
  own will, and before sunset of a still, hot day they came over a hill and saw
  wild horses in the hollow beneath.</p>

  <p>The herd was not caught unawares. Already the outposts had brought in the
  warning of a man's approach, and now a fine chestnut stallion was whipping in
  the laggards, grouping his herd together. Finally, with a neigh he started
  them away at full gallop. Moonshine tore off in pursuit. Lee drew back on the
  mane and shouted. The pace of the silver-gray shortened, not to the rolling
  canter, but to a gait like a choppy sea. He called again, and the stallion
  reared and stopped, but with head strained high he stared at the fleeing
  herd. Was this his own band? Lee slid to the ground. Still with the weight of
  his two fingers on that arched neck he held the horse.</p>

  <p>"Moonshine, there's one thing," he said, "that time isn't going to change.
  Your kind isn't my kind. Here I am, and there run your horses. Make your
  choice."</p>

  <p>There was not even a turn of Moonshine's head in answer. When the fingers
  lifted, he was off with one high sway of his tail and a neigh that rang
  across the hill ridges and to the herd. Some of them, as if they recognized
  the command, shortened their gallop. There no longer remained much doubt that
  they were recognizing the old leader. Indeed, in a few more moments, the
  whole crowd had slowed to a trot, and the chestnut came swinging back to
  investigate. Moonshine went down the hill to meet him.</p>

  <p>It was a beautiful thing to see the two come together, falling from gallop
  to canter, from canter to trot, from trot to nervous, high-stepping walk.
  Behind them the herd scattered into a semi-circle, the wise old mare in the
  rear calling to the yearlings to keep them back, and restless young stallions
  coming curiously forward to watch and get points from the two champions. Nose
  to nose they met, arching necks. The pricked ears snapped suddenly back. With
  a squeal of rage the chestnut plunged at the throat of Moonshine with gaping
  teeth.</p>

  <p>A spring to one side, as if the wind had blown him, took the gray out of
  danger, and the new leader, floundering at the end of his rush, whirled and
  charged again while Moonshine watched with his head canted thoughtfully to
  one side. But he was ready for blood now. Up he reared and rained blows at
  the chestnut's snaky head. The new leader gave back with sinking
  hindquarters, dazed, but he had the bulldog blood that runs in all mustangs.
  He charged again, and this time he also reared. Apparently that was the
  opening for which the gray had hopes, as the old pugilist waits to shoot his
  favorite blow. He sprang forward with a short whinny, like a snarl almost,
  drove through the barrage of the striking forehoofs, and caught the new
  leader by the throat. The new leader went down, and Lee covered his eyes to
  shut away the rest of the horrible picture as Moonshine charged over the
  fallen horse.</p>

  <p>A moment later there was a great neigh and a beat of hoofs running toward
  him. It was Moonshine, his bright coat spotted with red. He swept about Lee
  in a spiral that ended when, with all fours planted, he slid to a halt. His
  muzzle was red, and his eyes were devilish. Behind him, down the slope, was
  the shapeless blotch that had been the chestnut leader. Lee neither moved nor
  spoke.</p>

  <p>Moonshine danced away, sidewise, like a boxer, and at the little distance
  he whinnied. It was clear to Lee, at last, that he was invited to Join the
  herd, but still, although his heart was thundering, he would neither move nor
  use the persuasion of his voice. He found a sullen, tormented pleasure in
  leaving the choice to the horse.</p>

  <p>The herd no longer waited, but moved down the valley at a trot, and at the
  heard ran a fine bay&mdash;a new aspirant for the vacancy. When Moonshine
  neighed, the ranks wavered and spread, but the bay called in turn, and they
  went on. Off went Moonshine down the slope, but halfway to the herd he
  whirled as suddenly as he had started, and, looking back, he neighed and
  stamped in a fretful fury of impatience. Another feint of going on with the
  herd brought no movement from Lee, so at last Moonshine came slowly up the
  hill, plodding with head fallen.</p>

  <p>By Lee he stopped and turned, and, together, they watched the wild horses
  drop over a ridge.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; THE BACK TRAIL</h2>

  <p class="first">The upper Samson Mountains crowded together behind them as
  Lee Garrison rode Moonshine into the southern range, bound for the Staked
  Plains. It was a long trail, but over every mile that he had labored on foot
  he would now gallop on the back of the stallion. Indeed, he almost wished
  that the trail would never end; on such a horse he felt that he should go on
  to some glorious destiny. What bright goal was possible to a cowpuncher? Like
  a child on a feast day, shutting out the thought of tomorrow and its school,
  he lost himself in delight of the moment.</p>

  <p>They came out, on a day, to the shoulder of a hill, the arm of which had
  been chopped off. They came at a swinging gallop, and Moonshine slid to a
  halt, knocking up a shower of pebbles that dropped silently out of sight
  beyond the edge. A more clumsy animal might have plunged with its rider where
  those stones were falling, but so accustomed had Lee grown to the goat-footed
  surety of his horse that he merely laughed at the dizzy thought and let
  Moonshine step still nearer to the verge until they could look down between
  the hollow walls of the caqon to its floor.</p>

  <p>At this season the stream that had plowed the gorge among the mountains
  was a muddy trickle among big, sun-whitened rocks that its spring current
  would roll again toward the sea. At the head of the little valley there was a
  hundred-foot cliff above the broad scar of the waterfall where now only a
  few streaks glistened on the flat, rock face. Close to it was the first house
  he had seen in all the hunt from the southland, and now his heart fell at the
  sight of it.</p>

  <p>Here ended his holiday. The world from which he had run away returned to
  him. He could not play forever. Inescapable duty called to him. Duty to what?
  He was answerable to no man. Yet the heavy truth oppressed him. There was
  something he must do. It bewildered him, and the harder he grasped at an
  understanding, the more completely it evaded him. There could be nothing less
  imposing than yonder little wedge of a roof, unpainted and melting into the
  weathered brown of the cliff, but yonder little house sheltered one of those
  outlyers of civilization, one of those hardy fellows who tear a livelihood
  out of rocks and sand. The very thought of his labor cast a burden of
  weariness upon Lee. He wrinkled his forehead; there was an ache in his heart.
  For tomorrow he must go and do likewise.</p>

  <p>He groaned at last so that Moonshine, who with wise head canted had been
  studying the descent into the valley, now pricked his ears suddenly and
  turned with eloquent question to watch the master. So brave was that lifted
  head that Lee was shamed for his falling of the heart, and although instinct
  warned him to shut this caqon and its house from sight and mind, yet a
  perverse impulse forced him on. He loosed the reins, but, having learned long
  before that Moonshine's unguided way was generally the best in mountain work,
  he made no effort to pick a course. The gray, accordingly, after considering
  his task with another glance, started to the side. Thirty seconds of
  plunging, sliding, and leaping like a mountain sheep, and they came out
  smoothly upon the caqon floor. There the rider looked back at the course
  where they had slid, like water down the rock, and with that past danger
  exhilarating him he turned with a laugh toward the house. Yonder fellow
  should pay for these pains with a cup of coffee, at least.</p>

  <p>But now that he was close, he saw that the shack was unoccupied. He
  dropped the saddle and stepped toward it with Moonshine, dog-like, at his
  heels. Under the pressure of his hand the door gave way from the rust-eaten
  hinges and crashed in, sending a heavy ripple of dust across the floor. It
  was obviously intended as a summer house only, no doubt for use through a
  single season. How old it was he could not guess, for one winter night might
  have rotted these flimsy boards, and the interior was in hopeless confusion,
  owing to the fall of a boulder from the cliff above. It had carried the major
  portion of the roof with it in its fall, and now arose in the exact center of
  the floor, littered over with the ruin of its own making. On the whole, it
  was as dreary a bit of spoiled carpentry as one could hope to find, but
  Garrison looked about him with painful interest. The collapsing shack was a
  sharp reminder that beyond the foothills lay a world that claimed him, to
  which he must return, in which he must accomplish a man's work. A sense of
  truancy made Garrison as hollow of heart as the small boy when he hears the
  school bells chiding.</p>

  <p>He began to kick at the loose planks, grumbling so that Moonshine came
  halfway through the door and set up a tremendous din, pawing to find out what
  was the matter, until the first word Lee had ever spoken to him in a harsh
  voice reduced the horse to a high-headed silence. Lee continued to explore.
  In one corner a cheap little cast-iron stove sagged toward the floor. Beside
  the window hung a strip of what had once been a curtain, of a weather-faded
  pink. A bit of yellow paper fluttered in the corner, and he picked it up. He
  could make out the accurate delicacy of a girl's handwriting, but the ink was
  too blurred for reading. A moment later he kicked away a section of the
  fallen roof and found beneath it a glove, uncrushed. Garrison picked it up.
  It was a woman's glove, for the right hand, and made of tanned kid. The
  frayed tips told why it had been abandoned. The leather was femininely soft
  as he drew at the glove aimlessly and squeezed three fingers into the palm.
  At this a foolish thrill brought him out of his daydream. He hurried over to
  the corner and found the bit of paper once more. It was the beginning of an
  unfinished letter, and it proved that she who lived in this cabin, who wore
  this glove, who wrote this letter, was young. If she were young, might she
  not be beautiful? Yes, a sweet and startling surety came to him as though her
  bright ghost whispered from a corner. But where, where was she now? He
  brushed past Moonshine into the open.</p>

  <p>Below him in curling range on range the hills poured down to the plain.
  Men lived there, men labored there, wedded in yonder blue distance.</p>

  <p>A soft nose touched his shoulder. Guiltily he began to caress the
  stallion, but at length his hand fell away, and he found himself staring once
  more into the horizon. So he folded the glove and stowed it in his hip pocket
  with a frown.</p>

  <p>"Why, Moonshine," he said, "I've been cussing out the world without
  remembering that I don't know a thing about it. I've never known a man,
  really. I've sure never known a woman. Mountains are all well enough. But
  they can't talk to you. They can't smile at you. Why, partner, you and me
  have got a lot to find out about. Let's start the trail."</p>

  <p>If Moonshine did not fathom the peroration, he at least understood the act
  that followed it, consisting of a leap onto his back and a touch of heels on
  his flank. He was down the valley with a toss of the tail and a lift of the
  head.</p>

  <p>Until the dusk they traveled south over the hills, but in the first soft
  falling of the dark Lee made for a campfire that twinkled in the distance and
  then shone out like a huge yellow star. The star grew into a leaping fire,
  with a man moving in black silhouette on one side and a pack mule cropping
  dead bunch grass, on the other.</p>

  <p>Moonshine began to dance in anxiety, and Lee, to encourage him, dropped to
  the ground and walked on ahead. His own heart was warm long before he came
  into the heat of the fire, it was so marvelously good to see a human being
  again. As he came into the circle of the firelight, he called out a greeting,
  and the camper whirled with an exclamation. The sight of him stole half of
  Lee's joy for such a starving bit of manhood he had never seen before. He
  was, perhaps, an inch or so over five feet, and so thin that even under heavy
  cloth one was constantly aware of hunched shoulders, elbows, and knees. So
  shrunken was his flesh that one could see the death's head through his
  features.</p>

  <p>His greeting for the newcomer was a shrill cry and a reaching for a gun.
  Indeed, the appearance of Lee was by no means reassuring. His long hair was
  blown forward about a face covered with ragged beard; he was more than half
  naked; and he was attended by a gray horse out of a dream, that was ridden,
  apparently, without reins. Moreover, this fellow was brown as an Indian, and
  his eyes by the firelight seemed as wild and bright as the eyes of the
  horse.</p>

  <p>The pistol wobbled in the shaking hands of the little man, while he cried:
  "Keep off, chief! I need plenty of room, understand? Don't crowd me, because,
  if you try to jump this gun, you'll finish off. Heap plenty room, chief,
  understand?"</p>

  <p>The big gun in the unpracticed hand set Lee trembling, but, although he
  pushed his hands above his shoulders, he could not help smiling at the
  stranger's fear of Indians.</p>

  <p>He explained amiably that he was a cowpuncher, not a redskin wanderer, and
  briefly told how he had trailed Moonshine and worn him down at the expense of
  months of labor. Perhaps his smile was the only necessary part of his
  explanation. The first mention of the horse was the concluding touch, for the
  little man forgot about his gun and stepped closer to Moonshine. The stallion
  crowded up to the back of Lee in fear, snorting and stamping, while the man
  of the campfire moved about him.</p>

  <p>"Nice show horse," said the little stranger at length, nodding his head,
  "and he'd do for a lady's saddle work, I guess. But what he needs is legs.
  That's what a horse runs with&mdash;how can he get along without 'em?"</p>

  <p>"Get along?" cried Lee, "why, man, this is Moonshine! Get along? He can
  get along all day and.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The other raised his hand. "What can he do six furlongs in?" he asked.
  "Suppose I was to try to work him a mile in forty-five? Why, he simply
  couldn't stretch it, that's all! I could fan dust in his face with a
  five-year-old maiden that never limped a half in fifty-two! You walked a
  thousand miles for&mdash;that?"</p>

  <p>Lee was blind with anger, but the usefulness of the man tied his hands.
  The little man took the silence for surrender, and he continued more kindly.
  "But I always say that a man's horse is like a wife, you can't judge him by
  what he plays. I seen old Sure-shot Billy himself drop ten thousand on a
  three-legged filly, Mischief, to beat Kitty Bellairs, herself. I seen Sure-
  shot lay that wad myself. 'Billy,' said I, 'if you want to get rid of some
  money, for heaven's sake, remember your friends and let the bookies go.'"</p>

  <p>He laughed prodigiously at his story, his laughter sounding like the
  crowing of a rooster, and, when Lee chuckled at him, it did not occur to the
  man at the campfire that a few moments later Moonshine had eaten his first
  grains of barley from the hand of Lee, and Lee himself was supping on the
  fare of Buddy Slocum.</p>

  <p>The withered little man was so glad of company, so full of talk, that he
  gave Lee no time to answer an opening volume of questions, but followed at
  once with an account of himself. He was an ex-jockey who, having made a few
  thousand dollars by a lucky coup on a long shot, had read at the same time an
  obscure account of the strike at Crooked Creek, and had resolved that while
  his lucky spell was on him he would go West to dig gold from the ground,
  instead of out of the pockets of the bookmakers. It was a sad decision, said
  Buddy Slocum. Everything had gone wrong from the first. Finally he had
  reached a town within striking distance of the mines and had crowned the
  follies of his expedition by buying a pack and pack mule and going off among
  the hills. Of course, he had lost his way, and, after rambling four days, a
  horseman, bound for Crooked Creek, had passed him and directed him again. Now
  the mines were only a short distance south, and they were marked by a
  mountain nearby whose summit glittered with an outcropping of white rock,
  visible afar. In the meantime, his stock of money was shrunk from several
  thousands to hardly as many hundreds.</p>

  <p>However, now the mines were not far off. Before the week was out, who
  could tell? He might be rich and already started back for Broadway.</p>

  <p>To this tale, that lasted until the tins had been washed after the meal,
  Lee Garrison listened with a growing dissatisfaction. This ugly hard-eyed
  cheat began to seem typical of the entire race of men to which he was
  returning. He only saved himself from heavy melancholy by concentrating on
  the speech of the ex-jockey and trying to forget the speaker. The name of the
  mines gave him a chilly sense of the length of time he had been away from the
  world. Before he started on the trail of Moonshine, many weeks before, there
  had been no word in the West of such a place as Crooked Creek. Buddy Slocum
  now reached a stopping point and proposed a game of stud poker.</p>

  <p>"I been playing solitaire," he said, "and that's like Christmas without
  turkey."</p>

  <p>Lee refused; he had no money.</p>

  <p>"Stake a share in Moonshine," pleaded Buddy. "We'll start as small as you
  like," urged the man of the racetrack. "There's a rope on the gray that's
  worth a dollar. Put that up. You'll have poor man's luck."</p>

  <p>It was true prophecy. He could not lose. That last of the deal, that
  fluttering fifth card that decided one's fate in stud, was always a lucky
  card for Lee. In five minutes his dollar was twenty, and Slocum promptly
  raised the stakes with a sigh of satisfaction as he saw the game take on some
  semblance of real earnest. His new energy, however, brought him no better
  fortune. His losing was not a fixed habit. From twenty to a hundred was a
  quick step for Lee. From one hundred his winnings rose to two, while the
  manner of Buddy Slocum gradually changed from careless assurance to a cold
  and sneering intentness.</p>

  <p>"Beginner's luck," suggested Lee.</p>

  <p>"Beginner's luck?" echoed the other with emphasis. "Beginner's luck? I
  guess not, Garrison. But go on with the game. I ain't howling. First time
  I've been the fall guy in quite a while. Keep right on trying, pal!"</p>

  <p>Just what Slocum meant, Lee could not understand for a time, but it was
  easy to see that the ex-jockey was in a silent temper. A few minutes later
  Lee won a fat bet with four little sevens over three jacks and a pair of
  aces, and Slocum rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I'm through," he said. "I've got fifty left, and I'll keep it for
  luck."</p>

  <p>Lee dragged the entire quantity of his winnings from his pockets. It was
  more cash than he had ever seen before. The bills were fives and tens, and
  now he crunched scores of them under his fingers. One escaped and tumbled
  away across the tarpaulin on which they had been playing. Buddy Slocum's foot
  stirred, but he resisted the impulse and let the greenback roll past.</p>

  <p>"I can't start with a rope and get all this," said Lee frankly. "Besides,
  I was playing for fun, not for the coin. Take it back, Slocum. You're mighty
  welcome to it."</p>

  <p>This brought a snarl from Slocum, a veritable animal whine of rage.
  Instantly he was in a trembling, panting fury. He was no cheap sport, no
  yellow four-flusher, he declared. But from the very first he had suspected
  Lee was crooking the deal. Now he knew it. But let it go. The world was a
  small place. They would meet again, and then let Lee beware! In the meantime,
  the mountains offered plenty of room for them both, and he invited Lee to
  start for new quarters.</p>

  <p>Lee started, of course, and that night he was for long unable to sleep
  when he finally found grass for the gray and shelter for himself under the
  lee of a hill. Shame and disgust, as he reviewed the scene with Buddy Slocum,
  kept him awake, turning from side to side and gritting his teeth. This, then,
  was a foretaste of what he was to expect in the society of his fellows?</p>

  <p>Here he drew out the glove and ran the soft leather through his fingers.
  The strange-hearted hope rose again, and with it the feeling between sorrow
  and laughter. After all, there was a rustle and crisping of money in his
  pocket, and that meant feathering for his arrow that would carry him far in
  the pursuit.</p>

  <p>He began to try to visualize her face. Before he succeeded, he was
  asleep.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; CROOKED CREEK</h2>

  <p class="first">It was noon before Moonshine topped the northern ridge
  overlooking Crooked Creek. Darting back and forth among the boulders, a
  tan-colored stream, frothy here and there with the speed of its going,
  Crooked Creek had torn for itself a sharp-lipped caqon.</p>

  <p>From ridge to ridge the gulch had been hewn through solid rhyolite. How
  many thousands of drillers, how many tons of dynamite would have been needed
  to duplicate that excavation? Lee wrinkled his brow. There was pain of labor
  even in the thought. But the beauty of that rock! Wherever erosion had
  trenched away the stone were pigments unrusted and undimmed. Weathering could
  not tarnish that pale straw yellow or canary tinted with green. There was a
  lilac mist, streaked through and through with heavy cardinal, and yonder a
  lavender haze with chalk-white strata above it. And all these colors in solid
  rock. To Lee it seemed rather a bank of fog pierced with sunset colors,
  living with beauty.</p>

  <p>But between him and the creek the soft and mingling hues of the rhyolite
  were cut athwart by a fish-fin ridge of dirty, yellow porphyry. Two miles up
  and down the gorge it ran with the mines distributed about it&mdash;forty or
  fifty dumps, Lee estimated, and over each was a gallows frame for the whip or
  upright for the windlass, and every stick of these timbers were painted dark
  red. As if color were needed in Crooked Creek.</p>

  <p>There were myriad noises afloat in the gulch where a hundred double jacks
  rang on the drill heads, where men were shouting, where windlasses squeaked
  and the horse-turned drums were groaning. Moreover, all these voices struck
  through the rarified mountain air. But though cables shrieked and hammers
  rang, the desert silence was more powerful than all the uproar. From the
  opposite cliffs, echo melted ten voices together and flung them across the
  valley tenfold magnified. Yet the mountain quiet cradles the noise into
  harmonies. Half a mile away a miner was shooting eight ringing blasts, but
  they blew to the ear of Lee like eight notes of music.</p>

  <p>The mines themselves were of the least importance to Lee. It was the town
  he wished to see, and what a town it was. It ran the full length of the
  gulch, not more than a stone's throw in breadth at any point, but two miles
  long, an amazing huddle of tent tops and roofs, given a living shape by the
  sinuous twisting of the river. Below the town the hills fell away at once to
  the flat, and the rock-tearing river became a placid little stream, and by
  its left bank a road wound away into the lowlands.</p>

  <p>It was an amazingly busy thoroughfare over the naked plain. The air was so
  thin, so dry, that distance reduced objects in size, but did not blur them.
  Five little wagons, each drawn by six or eight Lilliputian nags, pushed up
  the slope. The dust clouds rose and melted away. He felt the labor of the
  team, nodding in rhythm. It seemed surprising that he could not hear the
  creaking of single-tree and wagon bed. Farther off some riders singly, or in
  groups, and another caravan were working out of the blue horizon. Another
  sound of blasting struck up the slope at him like a giant shouting to the
  world in a great, thick accent&mdash;gold!</p>

  <p>With joy in his throat he sent Moonshine down the slope. He wanted to
  sing, to shout, for under the morning shadow that was sinking in the gully
  was power which could be dug out of the earth and held in his
  hands&mdash;gold! That great magician could find him the lady of the glove
  and make the road to her only a step. Moonshine swayed on a perilous course
  among the boulders, but Lee Garrison had raised his face to the glove that he
  flaunted on high, and she whose hand had once filled it was now so clear, so
  smilingly near, that he could almost see the gleam of her eyes at the end of
  this trail. She had been etched in his brain before with delicate touches,
  pale as a vapor in moonlight, but now she was just around the corner from his
  hope.</p>

  <p>He dropped into an increasing uproar in the heart of the valley. It seemed
  that so many men breaking ground must surely sink a way to the very roots of
  the hills. In the meantime, he had no opportunity to look about, for
  Moonshine was dancing like a cat on wet ground or crouched with shuddering
  fear under a sudden weight of racket. With soothing hand and voice Lee kept
  him on the trembling verge of panic, but it was growing doubly difficult. Men
  began to tumble out of the mines and came to watch the passing of the
  half-naked brown man on the white stallion. Never were such men as these
  miners, so huge, so grimy, their faces besmudged with a stubble of beard.
  They came, some of them, with the eight-pound hammer still weighing down
  their hands. Every face was a new dread to Moonshine. He went along with
  tensed, cat-like steps, and now and again, pausing an instant, he jerked up
  his head and looked with wild eyes toward the blessed peace of the mountains.
  Yet he did not bolt, not even when the miners laughed and pointed at the
  rider.</p>

  <p>As for Lee, he accepted that laughter with an ease that was amazing to
  himself.</p>

  <p>It had been so long since he had seen men&mdash;except the rat-like
  countenance of Buddy Slocum&mdash;that he overflowed with good nature. In the
  other days he would have been tortured with shame to be made such a public
  show, but men who are starved forget fear, and Lee was famine-struck with
  need of human society. He laughed back at the crowd and waved a brown arm to
  them. Then someone in the background shouted: "Moonshine!" It was a fellow
  with a face pinched up into the shadow of a vast sombrero. "I've seen him
  with binoculars. I've seen him as clear as a picture. It's the Moonshine
  hoss."</p>

  <p>A whisper, washed out from that speaker, spread up the slope on either
  side and from the distance, where the double jacks were beating, new voices
  shouted, other men came running. A solid wall of the curious men closed
  across Lee's path. He stopped the terrified gray.</p>

  <p>"He isn't trained to stand for his picture, yet. Let me through, boys,"
  called Lee. "It's Moonshine, right enough."</p>

  <p>What admiration and wonder shone in their eyes.</p>

  <p>They gaped up at him like children, and a path split through the crowd.
  They volleyed their questions as he rode through. How had he captured the
  famous horse? What wild work had given him the semblance of a red Indian? How
  long had he been on the trail? Would he stay in Crooked Creek? There was not
  time to answer. Many went back to their work with a shouted promise to see
  him again. But a round dozen remained to escort him in triumph. The dozen in
  that escort became five hundred by the time they had passed half a block up
  the dusty, rutted street of Crooked Creek, for, if there were fifteen
  thousand in that strange city, fourteen thousand five hundred had no better
  occupation than to rush from point to point to hear or see the latest
  sensation. All that Lee saw, in his first intimate glimpse of the mining
  town, was an acre of upturned, grinning faces.</p>

  <p>He was asked where he wanted to go, and, when he said his first need was a
  bunk for himself and a place for the horse, they brought him to a flat-roofed
  shack. They waited until the door was opened by a little gray-haired Jewess
  in blue gingham that shone with starch and ironing. She threw up her hands
  with a cry at sight of a wild-man riding a horse without a saddle or bridle,
  and the gesture made Moonshine whirl and leap away. The crowd scattered with
  a yell of pleasure to see the bucking, but they were deeply disappointed,
  for, when Lee slipped to the ground and approached the door on foot,
  Moonshine crouched against his heels, throwing his head high so that he could
  keep in view all the terrible strangers who stood behind him.</p>

  <p>In a moment the agreement was made. Mrs. Samuels, the landlady of the
  lodging house, led the way to the rear where a little corral had been fenced
  with smooth wire. Her son had built it for his horse, she explained, but her
  son's horse could be tethered on the outside. So the gray stallion was led
  through the gate, and Lee closed it upon him. Moonshine bounded to the
  center, and then veered swiftly around the enclosure. He halted at last in
  terror, and Lee turned away sadly, for he knew that this was the end of their
  free companionship and the beginning of slavery for Moonshine.</p>

  <p>He was shown by Mrs. Samuels to her only vacant room. The price was three
  dollars for eight hours, and Lee, flushed with gambler's luck, took all three
  shifts for himself. The room was exactly six by eight. It was partitioned
  from the hall by one canvas sheet, and separated from the adjoining room by
  another. The furniture was a cheap folding cot and a chair, constructed from
  a box. The distinguishing feature was that the canvas flap, that served as a
  window, opened upon the street.</p>

  <p>"The view would be pretty fine?" suggested Mrs. Samuels, cocking her head
  to one side as she smiled up to him. "You wouldn't be getting lonely in a
  room like that, now!"</p>

  <p>One could not choose in Crooked Creek. She assured him it was the only
  available room in the town, so he paid his rent and went out to find clothes
  and a barber. In five minutes a hoarse-voiced, weary man in the store
  outfitted him with clothes, shoes, hat, cartridge belt, a revolver. In the
  corner of the store he threw off his old rags and stepped into his new
  costume. By the grace of chance it fitted him, fitted far too closely for the
  comfort of one grown accustomed to well-nigh skin-free abandon. The groaning
  tightness of the boots, the heat and weight of the clothes made Lee remember
  Moonshine and the encircling turn of the fence. Truly there was a burden in
  civilization. But somewhere in the background of noises in that busy little
  town a woman was singing an indistinguishable air. Perhaps it was she whose
  glove now rested in his breast pocket, for, since Moonshine had become his
  horse, all miracles were possible. He started eagerly on the trail of a
  barber.</p>

  <p>In such a camp one might have expected a barber shop to be a superfluous
  luxury, but luxuries outspeed many a necessity on the road to a gold rush
  town. There may be a vital shortage of canned beans, but there are sure to be
  diamonds. Lee found the barber in a shop made expeditiously by leaning a few
  planks against the side of a building. He sat down on a box to wait while the
  barber finished with another patron. They chatted busily the while.</p>

  <p>The barber was a stodgy man. His face ran down from a meager forehead into
  jowls that drooped loosely over his collar; his body sloped out from narrow
  shoulders to a great girth of abdomen. His lips were generally parted, and
  the lower one thrust out a little. In addition he had a habit of panting
  between phrases and motions. In spite of these handicaps, he was managing to
  do business in two ways with his customer. While he removed the hair from the
  face of the man, he struck terms for grubstaking the latter.</p>

  <p>"The last one started like a beauty, and then pinched out on me," declared
  the man who was being shaved. "I was in bonanza for a day, and after that I
  was nowhere. You're sure white for fixing me up for a new start, Gus, but
  you'll get back a thousand percent. I know the place&mdash;I know the place
  for it."</p>

  <p>He started clapping his hands on his knees and could hardly remain for the
  shaving to be finished, such was his eagerness to start out anew with pack
  and burro. When he left, he poured out one burst of frantic gratitude. The
  barber cut him short by thrusting a slip of paper into his hand.</p>

  <p>"You go to Swinnerton over in the store," he said. "He'll give you what
  you want, when he sees that. Now run along. And.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was interrupted by a crash of hoof beats in the street, and then a roar
  of voices that acted on the receiver of the grubstake like the reaching of an
  invisible hand. He lurched from the entrance and sped out of sight.</p>

  <p>"Somebody's made a big strike," interpreted the barber, motioning Lee into
  the chair, and then running a comb with affectionate dexterity through the
  long masses of hair. "Somebody's made a big strike, and somebody else has
  grabbed the news and come in to spill it. What you want? All this taken
  off?"</p>

  <p>"A clean shave and a short cut," answered Lee. "But how come you can stay
  in here, shaving people and grubstaking 'em, when they're scooping the gold
  up in buckets at Crooked Creek?"</p>

  <p>Gus lifted a handful of the locks and shore them away with a grinding
  slash of the scissors.</p>

  <p>"I'll get a handful out of some of them scoops," he said. "I'll get a
  little, if my luck lasts. Sure to, if I run into many like that Bill White
  that just went out."</p>

  <p>"Good miner, eh? Known him a long time?"</p>

  <p>"About half an hour. Yes, he's a good miner."</p>

  <p>"Half an hour!" exclaimed Lee. "And yet you grubstake him?"</p>

  <p>"I've grubstaked some, five minutes after I met 'em. I'd rather know 'em
  short than long."</p>

  <p>"Well," murmured Lee sympathetically, "I hope you don't lose your
  money."</p>

  <p>"But you think I will, eh? Look here, son, if you got eyes to read with,
  you can see what's on a page in a couple of seconds, can't you? Same way, you
  can see what's in a man, if you know the language he's wrote in." He grunted
  complacently.</p>

  <p>"You mean to say you look right through gents, maybe?" suggested Lee. "You
  can tell what he's going to do? What luck he'll have?"</p>

  <p>"No place better than a barber's chair for reading a man," said the other.
  "I been working the camps close onto thirty years, and I've always worked 'em
  with a razor." He elaborated on his jest, chuckling. "Dig my gold with a
  razor&mdash;does a cleaner job!"</p>

  <p>"You generally win out?"</p>

  <p>"One in five pays me back&mdash;one in ten makes some money for
  me&mdash;one in a hundred hits it big. That's good enough for me. No, son, a
  barber's chair is my gold mine. See right through a gent when he's got soap
  on his face. Maybe that's because they got such a foolish look when they roll
  their eyes up at you."</p>

  <p>Lee smiled in his turn, for with the haircutting accomplished, Gus was now
  working up the lather, walking back and forth from the chair to the little
  stove on which the hot water steamed.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Lee, after he had puffed the soap from his lips, "what chance
  would I have of getting a grubstake?"</p>

  <p>The barber stepped back a little, poising his razor and thrusting out his
  lower lip. But in a moment he was smiling. When he smiled, his face was more
  frog-like than ever. He continued the shaving.</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked Lee.</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut," chuckled the barber. "You ain't a digger, son. You're a
  spender. You ain't a digger, and why should I give money to a spender?"</p>

  <p>"You don't figure me to be very thrifty, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Look here," Gus replied growlingly, his good humor vanishing as
  distinctly as a snap of the fingers, and as suddenly. "Look here, I ain't a
  fortune-teller&mdash;I'm a barber. I get paid for taking the hair off a
  gent's face, not for reading his palm. That's the trouble with all you
  youngsters. So plumb wrapped up in yourselves, it tickles you right to the
  gizzard to have folks talk about you. Well, I'd rather talk about the
  weather."</p>

  <p>He continued to mutter to himself, and Lee, abashed, attempted an
  expression of stern dignity, sadly marred when the barber slapped the skin
  taut on one side of his face for a polishing stroke. At least, his fee was
  most moderate, when he had finished.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, as his customer rose, "you don't look near so big, now
  that you got your whiskers off. Maybe you don't feel so big, either. Whiskers
  are queer things. They fool the gent that wears 'em more than the other folks
  that see 'em. I got two boys, one as much like the other as two peas in a
  pod&mdash;both great talkers. Jerry trimmed his mustaches off short and
  fashionable, and darned if he didn't get to be a traveling salesman and talks
  as smooth as you please. And Joe let his mustaches grow long at the ends and
  hang down, and so he had to go in for politics. Jerry saves dollars out of
  his talking, and Joe saves newspaper clippings. Jerry says he'll sell twice
  as much when he can afford to buy a diamond stickpin as big as his thumbnail,
  and Joe is chewing his lip and waiting to get bald. He says a bald head is
  his ticket to Washington. You see what a difference it made to them kids, the
  ways they grew their mustaches?"</p>

  <p>Lee Garrison, listening and smiling in spite of himself, stroked his skin
  as though it were a newly acquired property.</p>

  <p>"Partner," he said suddenly, "I guess you're all right. Maybe I did feel a
  little big."</p>

  <p>The barber nodded amiably, for nothing so softens the heart as criticism
  accepted. He even followed Lee to the entrance, and added: "And if I was you,
  son, I'd slip off that gun belt and gun and drop it private in a place where
  you wouldn't find it in a hurry. Maybe you can use it well enough not to have
  to do any shooting, but the sheriff ain't very active in Crooked Creek, my
  boy. We do our killing for ourselves. Gun play ain't no more popular here
  than a rattler in a tea party. Why, one good killing up here, and we'd have
  more law than would choke a bull. Our whole party would be plumb spoiled. You
  go along and step soft and be a good boy."</p>

  <p>So, with a playful little shove, he started Lee Garrison on his way into
  Crooked Creek.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE FIRST HOUR</h2>

  <p class="first">He had been too closely intent on changing his appearance to
  pay much heed to the town up to this point, but now he stepped out to observe
  and be observed. There was momently more to see, for now, as the evening drew
  closer, the men were beginning to come in from the mines. They were very much
  alike in spirit. Whether they had seen much or little yellow metal in the
  work of the day, each carried a high head and looked about him with a
  possessive eye, for, having been lately familiarized with magic visions of
  gold, all desirable things were only around the corner in their hopes. There
  was plenty to engage the mind along with that twisting, angling street of
  shacks and tents. The moment the news of the gold strike was verified, three
  jewelers had rushed extensive stocks to the valley. Now they were arrayed
  side by side, each vying with the other in the magnitude of his display in
  the unglassed windows. To guard the wares, two hard-faced men with sawed-off
  shotguns stood near. They had enough lead under trigger to wash the solid
  crowd from the street.</p>

  <p>These windows drew a continual audience in which the men stood in deep
  quiet, nearing the sparkler of his choice. In fact, the jewelers obtained a
  fat revenue from those who felt that the door of opportunity would open for
  them by the next day, at the latest, and made deposits to hold for
  twenty-four hours the dazzling transparency of a diamond.</p>

  <p>Lee Garrison peered for a while between heads and shoulders at the
  display, then turned with the rest to watch a monster wagon lumber past,
  drawn by twelve mules that leaned wearily into their collars. It was like a
  big ship in a small harbor. It fairly filled the street and jammed the crowd
  back on either side. The top of the load was well above the level of most of
  the roofs, and a shouting boy of twelve stood on the very crest, swaying back
  and forth against the sunset colors as the wheels, far below, dipped into the
  ruts through pools of dust. Besides the driver, who rode a wheel mule and
  managed the long jerk line in his left hand with the air of a master, there
  were six men who walked in a company before the team, waving their hats and
  yelling to the bystanders. A victorious troop of cavalry could not have
  raised a noisier jubilee or more dust.</p>

  <p>"That's what I call a pretty turnout," said a man beside Lee. "That's
  coming to dig in style, I say."</p>

  <p>"But style's not the only thing that counts," suggested Lee.</p>

  <p>"Some liquor on that," said the miner, turning the weather-hardened face
  of one who has lived his fifty years in the open. "Couldn't be truer, if you
  took it out of the Bible." He hooked his arm through the arm of Lee. "Look at
  me," he continued as they went on. "I come with the price of a pick and a
  prayer. Hit the stuff the second day&mdash;been in bonanza ever since." His
  head jerked back with exultation. "After all these years," said the miner.
  "After all these years!"</p>

  <p>The crowd immediately before them slowed and thickened around the only
  glassed windows in Crooked Creek, the windows that framed the brilliant
  display of the leading haberdasher of the moment. Gold and bronze and green
  and red and burning orange, the neckties and scarves and silk shirts flamed
  like autumn foliage of fiery mid-October. Against that glowing background
  stood a full-length model of a gentleman in evening dress, most formal from
  glimmering top hat down the broad-like front of the shirt, relieved with ruby
  studs, to a waistcoat made snug above an incredibly slender pair of hips, and
  so on to the trousers, pressed to knife-edge creases, and patent leather
  shoes. The dummy clasped white gloves in one pink hand, and the
  other&mdash;most life-like&mdash;was raised to toy with the stately,
  wide-sweeping mustaches. Lee's companion puffed out his chest and drew in his
  chin, an unconscious imitation.</p>

  <p>The crowd kept silent.</p>

  <p>"There's a high stepper, eh?" murmured the miner. "Now, how d'you think
  I'd look, turned out like that?"</p>

  <p>"Fine as silk," answered the sympathetic Lee. "But do they ease around in
  togs like that in Crooked Creek?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet. That's here for an ad, I guess. But one of these days they might
  start dressing up in the Frog Dump."</p>

  <p>"What's the Frog Dump?"</p>

  <p>"Monsoor Lefhvre's dance hall. He's got a slick place. Here's another
  hold-up."</p>

  <p>They heard a droning voice, so cunningly pitched that it floated through
  all the uproar of the crowd, and immediately they passed a white-headed man
  who bore in a tall legend upon his hat the following: "Blind by a powder
  burn. Please help!" The beggar extended alternate hands, for, no sooner was
  one stretched out, than it was filled with broad pieces of silver or rustling
  bills. Lee's companion pressed a large donation into the claw-like
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"First real, honest-Injun blind man in Crooked Creek," he said with pride
  as they went on. "Trouble is he's making so much money he can afford to
  retire pretty soon, and then we'll lose him. Hel-lo."</p>

  <p>A crackling stream of curses, loosed by a shrill voice just in front of
  them, stopped the drift of the crowd, jammed it back, and then split it into
  a score of confused groups as though with an explosion. Lee Garrison saw a
  little red-headed man with his hat hanging on the back of a very long, narrow
  head. That head jutted forward as though its weight were too great for the
  supporting neck. Drunken rage rocked him back and forth, and he reminded Lee
  with horrible vividness of a mad dog he had once seen with frothing muzzle
  and bloodshot eyes. His curses were driven at the head of a youth who was
  obviously certain that he was about to die, and who was obviously determined
  to die rather than run.</p>

  <p>"It's Red Billy Devine," said Lee's companion. "You and me'd better be
  sidetracking it, son. They'll have their guns out pronto!"</p>

  <p>But now another man began shouting from the far side of the street. "Hey!
  Hey! Cut that out!"</p>

  <p>Behold the fat barber waddling through the crowd like a sheep dog through
  a flock. All the body of Red Billy was shaking with passion, save his right
  hand only, and that was locked around the butt of his pistol until the
  instant that his stream of insults should induce the boy to pull his own
  weapon. Let into the path of that impending lightning flash, the barber made
  his way straight to terrible Red Billy and laid his pudgy hand on the collar
  of the man of war. Amazement set the crowd gaping.</p>

  <p>"Now look here, Billy, you little fool," said Gus, "what you mean by
  making all this noise? Twice I sliced the gent I was shaving, listening to
  you holler!"</p>

  <p>The wild eyes fastened on the face of Gus. "All I do is ask him for a
  measly hundred bucks," said the gunfighter. "He says he ain't got it. Ain't
  got a hundred dollars? Why, ain't everybody here got thousands? Him with a
  white skin and talking white, but he wouldn't give me a hundred dollars!" His
  voice broke with sorrow. "Gus, how come a man can be as low as that?"</p>

  <p>"You come along with me," commanded Gus. "You're drunk, that's what's the
  matter."</p>

  <p>"Me drunk?" shrilled Red Devine. "Lemme show you how steady my hand is,
  Gus. Just lemme kill him&mdash;just that one skunk, Gus!"</p>

  <p>"Not a one," said Gus. "You'd get a sheriff and a flock of deputies up
  here investigating, would you? They'd have this little old town starched as
  stiff as a Sunday collar."</p>

  <p>"But he ain't a man. He's a hound, Gus. It cuts me all up to have
  something like him walking around, making folks think he's a man."</p>

  <p>"You shut up and come along with me," broke in Gus, and, under the impulse
  of that arm, Red Billy turned and went with reeling steps beside the barber.
  The crowd flowed in behind them.</p>

  <p>"That's nerve," commented Lee's new friend. "If I'd've had a gun, I
  might've&mdash;but Gus, he has the nerve."</p>

  <p>"Funny that Devine let him manhandle him, though," suggested Lee.</p>

  <p>"Funny? Devine knew damn well he'd get shot full of holes, if he tried to
  pull his gun. Gus Tree is fast as a wink. Here we are!"</p>

  <p>While Lee digested the astonishing news of the fat barber's prowess, he
  was guided through a wide pair of swinging doors into a saloon and pressed
  among the drinkers, five deep at the bar. They reached a place where he could
  look into the only mirror that had as yet been brought to the camp.</p>

  <p>"You get better liquor over to Monsoor Lefhvre's," said Lee's companion,
  who now introduced himself as John Patterson. "But they charge such prices
  that the damned stuff chokes me going down. Might as well turn some gold dust
  into your throat."</p>

  <p>Lee heard him in dim distance through a fog of his own thoughts, for the
  face that confronted him in the mirror and that sat on his own shoulders was
  the face of a stranger. Smooth-cheeked, boyish, sullen of mouth had been the
  fence rider of that range far south, but now a lean, grim, straight-eyed man
  stood before him in the mirror. It was like falling asleep and waking with
  mind and soul wrapped in a new body. Somewhere in the quest for Moonshine,
  one self had died, and a new self gripped the whiskey glass at the bar in
  Crooked Creek. The man in the mirror raised the glass, and Lee lowered it
  slowly.</p>

  <p>"Fill 'em up!" he said to the bartender, and turned to look over
  Crawford's Place. It consisted of two sections. The first to be built had
  been the barroom itself, a sprawling shack of raw pine lumber that was now
  jammed with men. But the rear end of the original building had been knocked
  out and opened onto a long dance hall, with little tables and scores of
  stools along the sides and a narrow dance floor down the center. It was not
  the hour for dancing, however, and here and there a random game of poker was
  in progress. The walls and roof of this second and larger portion of the
  establishment were canvas. Patterson pointed out Crawford himself, a burly
  ruffian who looked the part of an ex-pugilist, standing now between his
  dance hall and his bar, in a position from which he could overlook the entire
  crowd. He wore two guns and rested his hands upon the butts with what seemed
  to Lee an undue aggressiveness.</p>

  <p>But as Patterson explained readily: "He's got to show 'em that he's on the
  job every minute. They're only waiting to take an advantage. There's a dozen
  gunfighters in here this minute. Look yonder&mdash;there comes Bill Devine,
  looking for more trouble. And there's Charlie Kirk, the murdering hound! And
  there is King Peters himself. By heaven, I didn't know he was in town!"</p>

  <p>He designated with awe a handsome youth who could hardly have turned his
  eighteenth year, but whose lordly manner and the elbow room he was given at
  the bar proclaimed him a man of distinction.</p>

  <p>"Why King Peters ain't hung, I dunno," muttered Patterson. "But with a
  gang of killers like that around, you can't blame Crawford for packing two
  guns and Sidney came along&mdash;got him interested in irrigation&mdash;and
  he sunk the whole wad in three years. There was Hamilton Coster. He was the
  regular cattle king. He went broke about a year after Billy picked up with
  him. There's a long line of 'em. Never failed to be a Jonah wherever he went.
  But Crawford seems to be an exception. Billy found Crawford a bum, picked him
  up, got him on his feet, and now Crawford is making about a thousand a day
  out of this place and other things. He's made Crawford into a white man.
  There's a yarn that.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His voice melted away in a hearty roar of applause that had risen from
  every throat in the room as the swinging doors were dashed apart and a huge
  man strode in carrying a boy perched on one shoulder.</p>

  <p>"That drink sure rode well," said Lee to Patterson. "Sat right down in the
  saddle. Let's have another, and tell me why they're busting their throats for
  that fellow."</p>

  <p>But Patterson was gone from him and was working his way through the crowd
  to get closer to the giant.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the latter had advanced to the bar and deposited the boy
  upon it, while dry-throated miners abandoned their drinks on either side to
  make ample room. Why such precious space should be turned over to the
  youngster was bewildering to Lee, for all he saw was simply an over-petted,
  over-pampered, overdressed little invalid of six or eight years. He was
  turned out like a miniature cowpuncher more gaudy than a rich Mexican. A
  sombrero of bright, blue velvet was belted with gold, worked into arabesques.
  A scarlet bandanna surrounded his throat, and beneath it was a vest of soft
  fawn skin held together with big pearl buttons. About his meager hips sagged
  a cartridge belt mounted richly in gold, and the same metal appeared in the
  chasing on keeping 'em in sight. There he's sending old Bad Luck Billy Sidney
  to ask somebody to step out of the place till some of his liquor has
  evaporated. Good thing about Crawford. He don't let 'em get mad drunk in his
  place."</p>

  <p>Glancing again toward the proprietor of the saloon, Lee saw that he had
  just waved off on a mission an ancient fellow whose silver hair and shrunken
  body spoke of a full seventy years, at least. Yet, he carried his tall frame
  as straight as any youth, the smile of a youth still in his little pale-blue
  eyes. Lee looked curiously after him until he was lost in the crowd which
  momently thickened. Every instant the swinging door flashed open, and
  newcomers arrived from the mines. And one of the new arrivals was no other
  than little Buddy Slocum, now dressed in complete miner's costume of heavy
  boots and dirty slouch hat, with his shirt open at the throat. Every article
  was sized too large and emphasized the more the wizened body of the
  ex-jockey. He caught sight of Lee at once, and his face contracted into a
  snarl of malevolence as he turned to mutter to his companion. The latter
  looked straight at Lee with the unmistakable glance of one examining a
  dangerous man. There was no doubt that Buddy would noise Lee abroad as a
  crooked gambler.</p>

  <p>To crowd that disagreeable thought out of his mind with another topic, he
  turned back to Patterson. "How does Bad Luck Billy get that name?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"You ain't heard of him? Well, almost everybody has. Been around for
  thirty years. Finds a man to tie to and starts making himself useful. Ain't
  got the gumption, somehow, to work by himself. And every man he comes to goes
  down and out sooner or later. That bad luck of his is catching. There was old
  Hugh Gummere. He dug so much gold he didn't know what to do with it all. But
  Billy the butt of the tiny revolver that the belt supported, while the
  holster was red morocco, with a pattern worked on it in small emeralds. Below
  the gun, silk-corduroy riding trousers disappeared into red boots to match
  the holster. To top off an outfit that would have made the heart of an
  African king leap with envy, the tiny fellow carried a quirt whose handle was
  roughened with a profusion of jewels that flashed as he pushed back his heavy
  hat with the whip.</p>

  <p>But clothes could not longer make the child happy. His colorless, sullen
  mouth did not curve to a smile as he turned here and there and surveyed the
  smiling, cheering crowd with eyes at once fever-bright and weary. He was
  guarded against a fall by the great encircling arm of his companion. The
  latter measured from the floor well-nigh as high as the lad standing on the
  bar. He was as roughly dressed as any man in the room, with only one point of
  foppishness, this being the extreme nicety with which the black beard that
  covered most of his face below the eyes was brought to a sharp point below
  the chin. For the rest, the upper part of his cheek shone like a red apple
  with the coursing of healthy blood. It seemed that the least fraction of his
  enormous overplus of health would have sufficed to cram the little body of
  the child with energy and high spirits. He took his hat from a head tousled
  with dense, black curls and waved it to the crowd.</p>

  <p>"Charlie's struck it rich again, boys," he cried in a voice that made Lee
  start with many memories. "Charlie's landed in bonanza once more, and he's
  come to set 'em up for the crowd."</p>

  <p>A growing bellow of applause nearly drowned the last of these words, and
  yet there was no reflection of the cheer in the sad little face of
  Charlie.</p>

  <p>"Set 'em, barkeep," continued the bearded man, "and hark to this, boys.
  Charlie tells me he knows they's some in camp that ain't had his luck, and he
  wants 'em to have another chance. He'll grubstake ten men today&mdash;the
  first ten that shake hands with him. Come on, boys. Who wants backing?"</p>

  <p>The steady flow of high-priced liquor across the bar had seemed to
  indicate that everyone was well enough found in money, but now a score of men
  came to vigorous life and squeezed, shouting, through the crowd to get at the
  outstretched hand of Charlie. They closed with a rush around him, and, as
  their huge brown hands reached toward the boy, for the first time Lee saw him
  flush with pleasure. He danced back on the bar as far as the thick arm of his
  father would permit him, laughing and clapping his hands together, holding
  them high above his head so that no one could quite come to grips with him.
  The giant father looked up to the child, his face suffused with such joy that
  the black beard trembled. Looking into his face from this angle, Lee Garrison
  remembered. It was Olie Guttorm, disguised only by the semi-foreign cast that
  the pointed trimming of his beard gave him. It was Olie Guttorm as he had
  been when he disappeared over the hilltop with the chunk of rose quartz in
  his hand and his dark eyes ablaze on the trail of gold.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE FIGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">He remembered still more. No wonder these mountains had
  seemed dreamily familiar, for the vision dream in which he had seen them
  first was the nightmare of pain when he trudged among them on the trail of
  Moonshine. Had he not seen, at the head of Crooked Creek, the hill with the
  crown of white rocks? Yes, beyond question that was the place where he had
  picked up his sample. His directions had pointed the way to a fortune for
  Olie Guttorm, and Olie Guttorm's discovery had brought a gold rush into the
  hills. Lee felt very much as one who picks the small hole in the dam and in a
  moment sees it widened to a roar of water. No wonder that the crowd gave way,
  then, for Guttorm must be the patron saint of Crooked Creek, the fountainhead
  of all the riches of money and happiness that might pour from it.</p>

  <p>A sigh escaped him. All this wealth, then, had been his for the choosing,
  and he had given it all for Moonshine. But the very thought conjured a mind-
  filling picture of the horse. And Lee was content. The first poison taint of
  envy had slipped out of his mind, and he was even able to look around the
  barroom with an almost paternal satisfaction. He had more than money could
  buy. Money? All the money in the world would hardly be worth the joy of
  honest Olie Guttorm when he met his benefactor. There is no wine like
  self-satisfaction to warm the heart. Lee Garrison could not help thrusting
  his hands in his trousers pockets and teetering back on his heels.</p>

  <p>Shouting with laughter and eagerness, every down-at-the-heel gold seeker
  in the room crowded toward little Charlie Guttorm. One by one they dragged
  down his pipe-stem arms and enveloped his fists in great, brown hands.</p>

  <p>"That's ten!" he shrilled presently. "There ain't no more! There ain't no
  more!"</p>

  <p>And, shaking his head, he clasped his hands behind his back. Others were
  still herding in toward him, but Olie Guttorm, with a sweep of his thick arm
  and a bellow, stopped them short.</p>

  <p>"Charlie says no," he declared, "and what he says goes. Being denied ain't
  good for him, is it, Doc?"</p>

  <p>The being so appealed to now sauntered forward from the outskirts of the
  crowd, slowly twirling a glass of whiskey between thumb and forefinger. He
  seemed to Lee Garrison one of those men who pride themselves, above all else,
  on their coolness, unfailing in every situation. He had one of those round,
  small-nosed faces that never quite lose the boy look and that persisted in
  Dr. William McLeod in spite of his fifty years and his gray hair, so thin
  that the red of his scalp showed through. He was jauntily dressed in
  knickerbockers and a tweed coat in which such blues and reds were woven that
  purple resulted, a cheerful and almost violent purple. The miners gave back
  before him, such was their respect for everything appertaining to Charlie
  Guttorm, and even the doctor's unseasonable nature of attire did not cause
  them to pass the wink and grin. Perhaps, decided Lee, they were accustomed to
  the doctor and his ways.</p>

  <p>The latter had now paused, spreading his legs and tossing off half his
  glass before he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Within limits, Mister Guttorm," he said. "Everything in measure. You
  continually ask me for an absolute yes, or an absolute no. My dear Mister
  Guttorm, how often have I told you, that in such a case as that of little
  Charlie, the absolute is precisely what must be most avoided. Discretion is
  what we must have, and the middle ground is that on which we must take our
  stand."</p>

  <p>"What the devil, Doc!" groaned Olie Guttorm, but in a tone rather of
  pleading than anger. "I sort of get your drift, but I always got to look
  through a blizzard of words to make out where you're heading. Right
  now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The doctor halted further speech by removing his left hand from his coat
  pocket and holding it up in protest. He then drank off the remainder of his
  potion and continued: "If you want brevity, by all means. Charlie has had
  enough excitement. Take him home at once!"</p>

  <p>Olie Guttorm swept Charlie off the bar and into the cherished strength of
  his arms.</p>

  <p>"Right away quick, Doc," he said. "I'm sure sorry!"</p>

  <p>He seemed to be apologizing, but the doctor with a shrug of his shoulders
  turned his back on his patron and started for the bar. Little Charlie writhed
  in the grasp of his father until one fist was free, and he shook this in the
  direction of the retreating doctor.</p>

  <p>"You big hog!" screamed Charlie. "I hate you! An' I'll get even&mdash;you
  wait! I'll get even with you, and.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here his rage relaxed sufficiently to permit him to pass into a wail of
  grief. He turned on his father and beat his fists, small and bony as the
  claws of a bird, into the face of Olie. The big man merely blinked under the
  rain of blows and then rendered Charlie helpless by pressing him gently into
  the hollow of his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"It ain't nobody's fault but mine," declared Olie sadly to the nearby men
  who were protesting that they hoped Charlie would feel no ill effects. "I
  should have knowed better than to bring him down here. But he wanted to show
  off his new clothes, and.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Charlie writhed halfway around. "It's everybody's fault!" he cried.
  "An'&mdash;an' I don't want you to give one of 'em a single cent of money,
  Dad, you hear me? If you give one of 'em a single cent, I&mdash;I'll cry all
  night long an' make myself.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush up, Charlie. Don't you worry none about nothing, Son," said Olie. "I
  ain't going to do nothing that'll hurt your feelings, Son. They ain't going
  to get a cent of money out of me."</p>

  <p>Charlie relaxed to a whine, while the father, reassuring the stake-seekers
  with a wink, started again toward the door. Around him rose a chorus of
  thanks and kindly farewells that set the eyes of the simple fellows gleaming
  with happiness. It was while he looked around to collect this tribute of
  applause that his glance fell on Lee Garrison. All joy was wiped from his
  face. He hurried on with his head a trifle inclined.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly he had recognized Lee, but why that recognition should affect
  him so strangely the latter could not imagine, so he slipped into the path of
  Guttorm near the swinging doors and approached him with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Olie Guttorm!" he said. "I guess you remember me?"</p>

  <p>"Know you!" roared Guttorm so violently that his beard shook. "Sure, I
  know you, and I don't know no good about you. Get out of the way and lemme
  pass!"</p>

  <p>His thick arm brushed the other aside; the swinging door clicked behind
  him and fanned a warm breath of air into the face of Lee.</p>

  <p>"Why, damn your thick hide, I'll teach you to remember.&mdash;" Half a
  dozen hands gripped him as he sprang in pursuit. They tore him back and
  jammed him against the wall.</p>

  <p>"You'll teach him nothing!" growlingly answered one. "You wait till
  Guttorm has got his kid off of his hands, and then he'll handle you. But
  right now, you'll leave him he."</p>

  <p>The knowledge that he was so completely in the right and Guttorm so
  completely in the wrong stifled Lee, as though he had been discovered in an
  act of most shameful imposture. They were honest men, these fellows, and, as
  he confronted their hostile faces, he knew that his story would never be
  believed no matter how many oaths he swore to it. He could never dare to
  stand up before sane men and tell them that he had given up a gold mine for a
  pipeful of tobacco and liberty to pursue a mustang&mdash;on foot! An hysteria
  of rage made his wits spin. Olie Guttorm was far away and barred from him,
  moreover, by the devotion of every hardy man in the town, but within arm's
  reach were six or seven who had just laid hands on him.</p>

  <p>The places where their fingers had gripped burned him, and by ill chance
  in that instant of quiet he heard a voice saying: "That's him who caught
  Moonshine. They been telling me that he's a gambler, too, and crooked as a
  snake!"</p>

  <p>It was one of those murmuring voices that is meant for a single ear only,
  but it was the spark that ignited all the gunpowder of Lee's fury. There was
  no volition in it. His fist of its own accord doubled, his arm lashed out,
  and he struck into the nearest face. He felt the knuckles bite through flesh
  to bone. His arm jarred from wrist to shoulder with a numb tingle, and under
  the shock the other went down. From around him a dozen men sprang, not at
  Lee, but to clear a space, for when a blow had been struck, guns must follow.
  But as for Lee there was no thought of another weapon than his bare hands, so
  much had rage blinded him, and, when he saw the fallen man twitch a revolver
  from its holster, his passion became pure madness. He ran straight in on the
  leveled Colt.</p>

  <p>For an instant fate waited. The blind god of chance saved him from the
  bullet that hummed past his ear. He tore the gun from the prostrate man and
  jerked the half-dazed fellow to his feet.</p>

  <p>"You yellow-bellied hound!" shrilled Lee. "Get out of this place and get
  out of town. If I see you again, I'll break your murdering neck for you.
  Start moving!"</p>

  <p>Not until he had spoken did his brain clear, and his eyes. He saw that he
  was confronting no other man than that youth of wild fame, King Peters
  himself, and a prickle of fear worked up his spine. But King Peters was a man
  transformed. It is not a small thing, at the tender age of eighteen, to be
  looked upon askance by the law-abiding, to have one's lightest word or
  gesture noted, to discover a magic in one's glance that makes the eyes of
  strong men fall, to be robed with a repute that shakes the nerves of even the
  brave. And here was a stranger, an unknown, who had leaped on him like a
  tiger, knocked him to the ground, run in upon his leveled gun, escaped his
  shot by enchantment, torn the weapon from his fingers, and now threatened him
  with death, if they met again. It was a glimpse into a new world for King
  Peters. That lordly courage which had been founded upon a knowledge of
  superior nimbleness of fingers and wrist, superior steadiness of eye, melted
  like a ghost at break of day. Fate, he felt, had overtaken him, and with a
  fallen head he shrank from the barroom.</p>

  <p>There was a little murmur of taken breaths such as men draw when they have
  seen a shameful and a wonderful thing. To more than one that picture was like
  a prophecy, for how many of them had blustered a way among their fellows? And
  each rough-handed man saw a time coming when he should be mastered by some
  fiery and fearless spirit.</p>

  <p>How could they tell that the most astonished man in Crawford's Place was
  Lee Garrison, and that it was the numbness of slowly departing fear that made
  him walk so slowly toward the door and slowly into the street?</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE CHARLATAN</h2>

  <p class="first">"I suppose," said a voice behind Lee as he went down the
  street, dazed, "that you wish to be alone to get the relish of that situation
  in retrospect. But I hope you'll pardon me, if I walk a step or two with
  you?"</p>

  <p>It was the doctor, overhauling Lee with the long and rhythmic stride of a
  fine walker. He seemed flushed both by the exercise and with emotion as he
  drew up to Garrison. "I'm Doctor McLeod," he said in introduction. "You may
  not have noticed me in the saloon a moment ago, but you would hear of me if
  you stay long enough in Crooked Creek. They've been snapping at my heels ever
  since I began to take care of the Guttorm brat, which is time thrown away,
  medically speaking, but financially&mdash;well, one must live, you know. In
  the meantime, I can't tell you how it tickled me to the very midriff to see
  that fellow Peters handled. He browbeat me only yesterday in Lefhvre's."</p>

  <p>He laughed and whirled his cane with such dexterity that it flashed in the
  sun like a shining disk, and Lee noted the tapering slenderness of his
  fingers. But more than any physical attribute, it seemed to him that he had
  never seen a man who exuded such an aroma, as it were, of perfect rascality.
  He apparently had no care to conceal his nature from Lee.</p>

  <p>"I should like to take your hand," ran on McLeod, "to thank you for that
  lesson to King Peters, but even the thick head of Olie Guttorm would turn
  suspicious if he heard that I had shaken hands with an enemy of his."</p>

  <p>"And what will he think when he hears you took a stroll with me?"</p>

  <p>"He will think what I tell him to think, as usual," said the doctor,
  "which is that I took this opportunity to advise you to leave town at your
  earliest opportunity because in going against the power of Olie Guttorm in
  this town you are going against a stone wall."</p>

  <p>"Look here&mdash;I'm not trying to bust Guttorm."</p>

  <p>"No? Old friend of his, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you the straight of it, Doctor. It was I who came across the
  outcropping of rose quartz up.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was interrupted by the suddenness with which the doctor turned upon him
  and by the bright-eyed gravity with which the professional man examined
  him.</p>

  <p>"Really?" said McLeod. "You are the man who found the ore, and the cunning
  villain, Olie Guttorm, has beaten you out of your just half of the profits
  while you lay sick of a cold in the head!" Here he broke into pleasantly
  modulated laughter.</p>

  <p>"By heavens, Garrison," he said, "I am not surprised to hear that you are
  such a wonder with cards. You have the face for the master poker player of
  the world. And if you possess the technique as well&mdash;tra-la-la!" He
  whistled a thrilling little strain of music and concluded by smiling
  benevolently upon Lee.</p>

  <p>It was easy to understand why he opened his heart so quickly and so
  completely. He felt that they belonged to the brotherhood of knaves.</p>

  <p>"That the hand that rocks the deck shall rule the world," paraphrased
  McLeod. "I sit in at a game occasionally myself, and I know a thing or two
  about the eloquence with which a pack may be taught to speak, but my great
  handicap is that I began too late in life. In cards, as in music, those who
  hope to be masters must start early and continue long."</p>

  <p>It would simply amuse the doctor to pretend to be innocent. The story
  which the jockey had told of that game by the campfire must have been
  eloquent, indeed.</p>

  <p>"Doctor," said Lee sullenly, "that little rat of a jockey has been telling
  lies about me, and you've believed him."</p>

  <p>McLeod chuckled with the utmost good humor. "My dear fellow," he said, "I
  have simply used my eyes. Someone was saying that you showed up in town,
  looking as wild as a wolf. Well, my friend, the wolf look doesn't lie in long
  hair alone. You have had your hair cut, I see, but you have not taken the
  wolf out of your step. You walk like a man about to run a race&mdash;or like
  a man just out of prison and infernally eager not to get caught and sent
  back." Here he probed Lee with a side glance, although he continued without
  interruption. "Although, of course, no prison could give a man a skin as
  brown as tanned leather and apparently as tough. But more than all this, you
  have a hungry eye, Garrison, as though you were questing for something&mdash;
  money&mdash;fame&mdash;a woman.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lee started. He fumbled in his pocket the soft leather of the glove.</p>

  <p>"Well?" McLeod was asking. "A pain from an old wound, or an idea?"</p>

  <p>"Both," answered Lee.</p>

  <p>McLeod sighed. "You're a lucky dog with your youth and your flying start.
  You'll walk on smooth lawns the rest of your days."</p>

  <p>Lee Garrison heard him out of a mist. He would lose that money he had won
  by playing cards the night before. He would go into Monsieur Lefhvre's gaming
  house and throw away every cent of it. Then he would start out to work in the
  mines until he had laid up a handsome stake, and with it in his
  pocket&mdash;oh, comforting thought of money cleanly won&mdash;he would go
  again adventuring on the trail that had started from the ruins of the little
  hut under the cliff.</p>

  <p>"Tush," murmured McLeod, "you are as secretive as a very mole, man,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is that youngster, Charlie&mdash;is he Guttorm's boy?"</p>

  <p>"He's Guttorm's boy. But there's none of Guttorm in him. He's all his
  mother's son, and, like most of that ilk, he's a whining, over-pampered
  little puppy. I have practiced facial expression most of my life, but, by
  heavens, I have nearly lost control of myself a dozen times. Every day I
  wonder if my tongue is about to stumble into ten words of the truth, and so
  kill the goose who lays the golden eggs."</p>

  <p>McLeod spun his cane and whistled another refrain as though to drive the
  melancholy thought from his mind.</p>

  <p>"Not really sick, then?" said Lee Garrison, relieved for, in spite of his
  anger, he had pitied the man for the sick boy he loved so well.</p>

  <p>"Sick?" repeated the doctor, and scuffed his heels jauntily. "Tut&mdash;
  he's dying!"</p>

  <p>"The devil!"</p>

  <p>"He is a devil in his own small way, and he'd grow up to wring the heart
  of poor Olie. He has another six weeks or so to linger along, or again, a bit
  of a shock, a cold, or almost anything might burn him out in thirty minutes."
  He made a gesture as though snuffing a candle.</p>

  <p>"Poor Guttorm," sighed Lee. "It'll about break his heart, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Hearts don't break these days," said the doctor. "That sort of thing is
  out of fashion."</p>

  <p>"Does Olie know there's no hope?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. That's why he employed me&mdash;the idiot! A dozen experts
  told him the truth. I heard about it, looked him up, and promised the boy
  long life and happiness&mdash;barring accidents."</p>

  <p>Lee caught his breath.</p>

  <p>"That surprises you, eh?" said the doctor, chuckling. "You know the tricks
  of your own trade&mdash;you'd clean out a parish priest of his last cent of
  charity money, but you cluck like a hen when you hear about my little game.
  Well, it's a neat one, at that."</p>

  <p>"When you become a doctor," said Lee, "don't you have to swear to&mdash;
  ?"</p>

  <p>"In heaven's name, lad," cried McLeod, "do you think I'm a real doctor?
  Practicing in Crooked Creek? Come, come, use your imagination. I'm no more a
  doctor than you, but I'm doing as good a job as the best doctor in the world,
  for I'm keeping the eyes of poor Guttorm closed on the truth, and that gives
  him happiness. Every day the youngster lives is a golden day for Olie
  Guttorm. Could the finest doctor under heaven improve on that? No, by the
  heavens, I'm his benefactor!" He threw out his hands. "It's pure benevolence,
  Garrison. And now I'm afraid we must walk no longer together, for, if I have
  simply been urging you to leave town because of the danger of Olie Guttorm, I
  could have crowded a very considerable expostulation into the space of our
  stroll, eh?"</p>

  <p>McLeod laughed so softly that a person ten yards away would not have heard
  him. Withal it seemed a hearty laugh&mdash;of a sort.</p>

  <p>"And you are going to stay, Garrison? You're not going to let public
  disapproval run you out of town?"</p>

  <p>"I guess not," said Lee, waiting for the hidden thing in the mind of the
  pseudo-doctor.</p>

  <p>"Good!" exclaimed the other. "As a matter of fact, while we sauntered
  along, an idea has been growing in me. Of course, I understand why you want
  to work Crooked Creek. There's oceans of gold here. Oceans of it!" His lips
  trembled over the words, and his eyes shone. "They're drunk with wealth,
  Garrison," he went on. "And why should they have it? The yokels! They know
  nothing but labor and boozing, whereas.&mdash;" Here he stopped short,
  glanced at Lee, and snapped his fingers.</p>

  <p>"The point is this," he said. "When you are making your harvest, I happen
  to know that it is easier for two to work together than one. You raise your
  eyebrows, eh? You are saying that is only true when the two are tried friends
  and can trust one another. True again, Garrison, but, if you decide to take a
  gambler's chance with me, it will pay you well&mdash;very well, on my honor.
  You are going to reap a great harvest&mdash;a great harvest! When I heard, in
  the saloon, about your skill with the cards, and then had a glimpse of your
  nerve in facing down the crowd&mdash;by Jove, I said to myself, Napoleon! But
  Napoleon needed marshals, Garrison. And you need a helper if you wish to make
  a quick reaping of the grain, and quick your work must be if you wish to
  escape from Crooked Creek before your past overtakes you in a tidal wave, or
  before some dozen of these gunfighters take the tidy thought of a murder into
  their hearts!"</p>

  <p>How completely the clever man was making himself a fool, thought Lee
  Garrison, and on the spot he made a wise resolve.</p>

  <p>"And now, Garrison, what d'you say? No reflection&mdash;quick, on the spur
  of the moment, speak your mind for or against and never mind my feelings. Is
  it yes or no?"</p>

  <p>Irritation, disgust with the false doctor, distress at his own strange
  situation in the mining camp were all overwhelmed in a wave of mirth that
  began to rise in Lee. He managed to keep back the laughter, but he could not
  prevent the smile.</p>

  <p>"Partner?" he said, "you're sure welcome to sit with me at any little game
  I'm in."</p>

  <p>"Ha," said McLeod softly, and his cane quivered in his grip. "That's
  good&mdash;that's damned good! The beauty of it is that they'll never suspect
  an underground wire between us two, not while I'm taking care of Guttorm's
  brat. But when do we get together and run over our signals? Or when can you
  let me know your system of daubing? I suppose you daub them, Garrison?"</p>

  <p>Lee, who had not the slightest idea what daubing might be, coughed. "I'll
  be at Lefhvre's tonight," he said. "You won't need signals, if you play with
  me."</p>

  <p>The doctor parted his lips to speak, changed his mind, and coughed in
  turn.</p>

  <p>"When you arrive at Lefhvre's, you'll find me in sight. Bonjour."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; THE LADY IN THE WINDOW</h2>

  <p class="first">To have built in five minutes the reputation of a crooked
  gambler and a fighter was a bewildering thing to Lee. But when one has roused
  a nest of hornets, it is wise to run, and he looked beyond the roofs of
  Crooked Creek to the mountains. Before night was thick, he would be among
  them. He went straight for Moonshine. Rumor had already gone before him; a
  whisper spread on either side as he passed; he felt men behind him, pausing
  and turning. But at last he was away from them all, and behind Mrs. Samuels's
  house he had sight of Moonshine, waiting for him in the rose of the sunset
  light. What a glad reunion it was from the instant the stallion caught sight
  of him and began plunging around the corral, until he came to a stop before
  his companion and knocked off the unfamiliar sombrero.</p>

  <p>Lee Garrison, in an outburst of melancholy joy, threw his arms around the
  neck of the horse and bowed his head against the shining mane. "Oh,
  Moonshine," he groaned, "I've been a terrible fool&mdash;I've been ten kinds
  of a fool. But we're going to get out of here. We're going to slide up them
  hills yonder and drop over on the other side into some place where we can be
  alone. Wasn't I the fool to have been hankering after the sight of men? I got
  on tolerable well with just books, once, and now I have you, besides. And
  I'll try again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here his voice, which had been trailing away, sank to nothingness, but
  behind his blank eyes his thoughts were speeding on to the conclusion that
  Malory and all the other books in the world would be a hollow comfort. The
  joy he had found in them was a ghostly thing remembered, and all his past
  life was a host of shadowy days.</p>

  <p>A whistle ran into his thoughts like the first thread of morning light
  into a room. He looked about, saw nothing, and wondered why his heart had
  leaped when he first surmised that the call might be for him. But who was
  there who could have cared to call him, after all? At the repetition of the
  whistle, therefore, he turned with greater indifference, and this time
  something moved in an upper window of the hotel, the only two-story structure
  in the town. The evening shadow had fallen so thick along that wall of the
  building that at first he made out only a misty form beyond the window, but
  that form now leaned into the light, and Lee Garrison was looking up into the
  face of a pretty, bright-haired girl.</p>

  <p>"Hello," called the vision.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Lee stupidly, "I'll be damned."</p>

  <p>She settled herself on the window sill, leaning at what seemed to Lee a
  dangerous angle.</p>

  <p>"You took off your hat to the horse," she continued, laughing, "and I
  think you might at least do as well by me."</p>

  <p>The flash of the white teeth and the twinkling of her eyes had been
  pleasant, even in the distance. Automatically he dragged off his hat, so
  intent on her that he was heedless of his disordered hair that the wind
  instantly blew erect on the top of his head.</p>

  <p>"You've been watching me, then?"</p>

  <p>"Don't flatter yourself, pal," said the lady, with an airy wave of her
  hand so that the lace of her dressing jacket fluttered behind the gesture. "A
  man hugging a horse is enough to draw a crowd even up here, where there ain't
  much but mountains to draw."</p>

  <p>And she laughed again, and suddenly he knew that the trail which had
  started with the glove had ended with the face of this girl in the window. He
  wandered closer.</p>

  <p>"You aren't going to leave, if I stop looking, are you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Her laughter went out. She ended by shading her eyes and peering earnestly
  down at him.</p>

  <p>"Where did you blow in from?" she asked. "What's your name?"</p>

  <p>"Lee Garrison, ma'am."</p>

  <p>She started to her feet at this. "You're him?"</p>

  <p>"Have you heard of me?" he asked wretchedly.</p>

  <p>She placed a hand over her mouth to shunt her voice in a new direction
  without turning her head from Lee. "Hey, Gertie. Come here quick, will
  you?"</p>

  <p>Gertie's head presently appeared at the window, and, seeing Lee, she
  gasped and huddled her negligee higher about her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Hello," she said to her companion rather than to Lee. "Found a
  friend?"</p>

  <p>"I hope so," said Lee earnestly.</p>

  <p>This threw the first lady into a gale of laughter. "He hopes so! Gertie, I
  want to present Mister Lee Garrison!"</p>

  <p>There was a squeal from Gertie. "Alice, you don't mean it."</p>

  <p>She dropped both hands on the window sill and leaned far out, a dark
  beauty who, having entered the late thirties used her make-up with more
  resolution than art, but in the dim light and the distance the effect was not
  altogether unpleasant.</p>

  <p>"Tickled to meet you, Mister Garrison," she called, fluttering her hand at
  him. "We've heard about your little party over at Crawford's. When are you
  going to look us up?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like to drop around and call any time I may," said Lee.</p>

  <p>They laughed again. They had the strangest habit, he thought, of laughing
  at everything.</p>

  <p>"Come into Lefhvre's tonight," said Alice. "I suppose you'll be making
  that headquarters, anyway. The Frenchy runs the only decent tables in town.
  When you're tired of talking to the cards, come in and talk to us, will
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Will I?" cried Lee, thrilling. "I'll tell a man I will! How soon are you
  going?"</p>

  <p>"We'll be there, when things start stirring, and they start stirring early
  in Crooked Creek. Lefhvre's is going strong by seven-thirty. We'll be there
  by eight. What time d'you expect to break up your own game?"</p>

  <p>"My game?" Then he comprehended. They had heard of Buddy Slocum's tale. He
  was glad of the deepening shadows. "I'll see you at eight," he managed to
  say, and waved to them as he turned away.</p>

  <p>They shouted farewell in musical chorus, and then he was around the corner
  and mercifully alone. A crooked gambler! He dug his fingernails into his
  palms in the bite and sting of his shame. But they had liked him, it seemed,
  in spite of his profession&mdash;how thick they had showered their kindness
  upon him. He would prove himself worthy of their esteem, he vowed. Before he
  met them he would throw away his money at Lefhvre's tables, and then meet
  them at eight o'clock with clean hands.</p>

  <p>Behind him, as he left, Moonshine neighed frantic protest at this new
  desertion, but Lee Garrison hardly heard the sound. His mind was crowded with
  memories of music of quite another nature. But when he was close to her, what
  could he find to say to so lovely and brilliant a creature? He drank deeply
  of the chill cup of humility; truly fortune had been blindly kind to him. He
  had found her in the very moment when he was about to desert the trail. He
  killed what time he could eating supper in the restaurant, and, as he stepped
  from the door, a man touched his arm.</p>

  <p>"Guttorm wants to see you," he whispered behind his hand. "He's out in his
  hoss shed behind his house&mdash;the red house at the end of the street, if
  you don't know."</p>

  <p>He disappeared around the corner, while Lee turned in the bidden direction
  down the street, passing through the yellow bars of lamplight that struck out
  from the open doors. Overhead the darkness pressed flat against the roofs of
  the town, for the sky was massed with clouds, and not a star showed through.
  Yet Lee was singing softly when he came opposite the big, sprawling house of
  Guttorm. He paused by an open window on his way toward the horse shed, and
  inside he saw little Charlie and McLeod. Charlie was wrapped to the chin in a
  brilliant Indian blanket in whose folds there seemed more strength than in
  the small body they surrounded. His head lay back against a pillow, and in
  his pinched features there was a dying wanness. The "doctor" walked to and
  fro with his hands dropped in the pockets of his coat, talking steadily,
  although Lee could not make out what he said.</p>

  <p>The eyes of Charlie opened, savagely discontent. "Stop!" he commanded. "I
  don't like it. I hate that story!"</p>

  <p>"Shall I leave you, Charlie? Do you want to stay here and rest by
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I want another story, with bears in it!"</p>

  <p>"A man hunting bears, eh?"</p>

  <p>The dull eyes of Charlie gleamed. "Or how bears hunt a man," he
  suggested.</p>

  <p>The last was hardly above a whisper, but Lee understood, because he was
  half expecting exactly those words. He started on just as the smooth,
  pleasant voice of McLeod began again.</p>

  <p>On one side of the horse shed there was a light, and, going toward it, Lee
  found Olie Guttorm seated cross-legged on the ground, busily at work with awl
  and waxed thread, repairing harness. As he sewed, he whistled softly. Now,
  for a moment, the burden of wealth had slipped from his shoulders. It touched
  Lee far more than the sight of the dying boy. He was strangely unable to be
  angry with the big man.</p>

  <p>At his approach Olie Guttorm rose solemnly to his full height, and the
  lantern cast his sprawling shadow over the wall beside him. He scowled upon
  his visitor.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Olie," said Lee, "you think that I've come to Crooked Creek to
  make you trouble. You're wrong." He paused placatingly.</p>

  <p>"Good," said the miner. "That's good!" He rubbed his hands. "You want a
  share of what I've made out of the mines, eh? Well, it's coming to you. I
  might say that I bought that ore and that location from you fair and square
  with the tobacco&mdash;or I might say, being as how I was drifting along in
  that direction, I'd have found that ledge myself in a few more hours. But I
  never dodge a debt. I pay up. Nobody could buy Crooked Creek with a pinch of
  tobacco." He had advanced to Lee, and now he dropped a hand on the latter's
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Still wrong, Olie," said the younger man. "Damned if you aren't all
  wrong. I don't want money that I haven't worked for."</p>

  <p>Olie Guttorm stepped back, lifting his hand from Lee's shoulder and
  hanging it in the air as a great fist, hard and jagged as a rock. Slowly the
  fist dropped to his side.</p>

  <p>"I thought it'd be this way," he said growlingly. "You want to get the
  credit for the Crooked Creek strike." His whiskers bristled. A black vein
  swelled on his forehead.</p>

  <p>"You don't understand," Lee insisted. "I don't want&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You lie!" gasped out the giant, glancing furtively around him. "Don't I
  see what's inside your head? You want 'em to cheer you the way they cheer me.
  You want to make me out a liar. But you're a fool to hold out for that,
  because I'll give you more money than you ever dreamed of, if you'll get out
  of Crooked Creek and never come back."</p>

  <p>"I been telling you that I won't take money, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait, wait!" pleaded Guttorm. "You dunno what you're about to say. I
  ain't talking about a few hundreds. I'm talking about hundreds of thousands
  to you, Garrison! Will you listen to me, partner? What does it mean to you?
  You're young, and, if you got money aplenty, you can make a name for yourself
  later on. But think what it'd mean to me, if the truth got out about how the
  strike was made. Why, they'd despise me! All them that have been talking as
  if I'd given them what they've dug up. Garrison, if you go inside the house
  with me, I'll show you sacks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll come back and talk to you tomorrow," said Lee, backing toward the
  door. "You don't get my drift at all, tonight. All I've been trying to say is
  that you're welcome to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was unheard. "Then go and be damned to you," cried Guttorm. "I've made
  a good offer. I'd give you a quarter, a third, of it all. But you want&mdash;
  get out!"</p>

  <p>With the last words his voice swelled to a roar, and he rushed at Lee with
  his clenched hands raised. And Lee Garrison fled without shame as one would
  flee from a beast. He raced through the darkness to the street, found himself
  unpursued, and slackened to a walk, panting.</p>

  <p>They were all mad, it seemed. The whole town was filled with the insane.
  If only the girl were not here, he would throw his gambler winnings into the
  dirt and not wait to get rid of them at Lefhvre's. But now that meant a
  diverting way of killing time until eight, that hour for which the world was
  waiting.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; ROULETTE</h2>

  <p class="first">A searcher for noisy excitement in Crooked Creek after dark
  would have passed up Monsieur Lefhvre's amusement palace for Crawford's, or
  one of the score of other saloons. And, in fact, fully as many jammed their
  way into Crawford's as passed through the wide door of Lefhvre's. For the
  Frenchman had established a law of silence in his gaming room, and, although
  the quiet kept out many a merrymaker with a pouchful of gold, Lefhvre had
  found that in a hushed room the bets run higher and men feel that fortune is
  leaning behind their chairs.</p>

  <p>The result was that there were few quarrels over the tables in Lefhvre's
  place, although a good many happened within twenty yards of his door. As
  midnight drew near, to be sure, there was a pronounced increase and
  sharpening of voices in the dancing section, but the moment that Lefhvre's
  big clock struck the first chime for twelve o'clock, every game stopped,
  every dance ended, and the guests must start elsewhere.</p>

  <p>If, at that hour, they went into Crawford's across the way, the contrast
  was sure to react most favorably in his behalf. But, at any rate, he was
  building up a repute that would make him strong as a rock when, as must
  inevitably happen, the town grew more settled and law and order became an
  invited guest. Then the past of Crawford's would rise in a black wave and
  sweep it away.</p>

  <p>When Lee turned in from the street through the little grove of whispering
  aspens that Lefhvre had so wisely left standing and that gave so much privacy
  to his house, a voice called softly, and "Doctor" McLeod appeared from among
  the trees.</p>

  <p>"I'm ready for the raid," said McLeod.</p>

  <p>"How much have you brought along?" asked Lee.</p>

  <p>"Five thousand," said the other.</p>

  <p>"Hmm," murmured Lee. "Did you get all of it out of Guttorm?"</p>

  <p>"That and more. Everything that touches him is gilded. He is all gold!
  But, by the way, that was rather a raw rub you gave the idiot."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"He came raving into the house a while back and told me that you had
  threatened to claim the honor of a prior discovery of the Crooked Creek ore,
  and that you are going about the town, swearing that you met him when you
  were famished and sold your knowledge to him for a pipeful of tobacco. He's
  nearly mad&mdash;he ramped and raved through the house until Charlie began to
  squeal&mdash;confound him! And the last I saw of them, Guttorm had the brat
  on his knees and was rumbling a song that sounded like a cart rolling over a
  bridge. But whatever your game is with Guttorm, you're pressing him pretty
  far. The big chap will be running berserk one of these days."</p>

  <p>"I have a grudge against him," said Lee, "and I worked up that yarn to
  worry him."</p>

  <p>"It sounds almost queer enough to be true. You have an imagination,
  Garrison, by heaven you have! What's the plan? How can you use me? I suppose
  you'll play poker?"</p>

  <p>"No, the machines?"</p>

  <p>"Good heavens, man, can you use me playing the machines?"</p>

  <p>"You're welcome to what you win," said Lee, smiling. "Follow me and bet
  where I bet."</p>

  <p>"But the machines&mdash;?" began McLeod in anxiety. "You have a
  system?"</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>"No doubt, but every system I've ever heard of.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lee Garrison cut him short by stepping through the door and into the
  hushed interior. He saw at once that the silence at Lefhvre's was maintained
  as a game by the miners. They stalked about with gliding steps, and where one
  of their fellows landed with a heavy heel or exclaimed in an unguarded
  moment, a score of heads were sure to turn toward him. The floor itself in
  the gaming section of the house was of a nature to induce silence, for it
  consisted of the heaviest canvas stretched over the unsmoothed timbers
  beneath. Canvas, again, formed the roof, for a timber roof would have been
  far too ponderous to be supported by the meager uprights, which, for the most
  part, were simply straight saplings with the limbs lopped off.</p>

  <p>As for the arrangement of Lefhvre's, it was both simple and effective. The
  one half of the place was the game room, scattered full of card tables at the
  sides, with the gambling machines in the center. At the rear of the room was
  a long bar well equipped with white-clad bartenders against the background of
  a thousand bottles of a thousand dyes. The bar extended out of the game room
  and into the other half of the building, that is to say, the dance hall.
  Through the big swinging doors, Lee glimpsed a polished floor, waxed and
  rubbed until it picked up the reflections of the lanterns and carried them to
  dim and watery depths. Moreover, the lights in the dance hall were so much
  brighter that the shaft through the door struck into the game room as into
  semi-darkness. He saw a swirl of color moving across the floor, with shadows
  in pastel shades underfoot. And in the dance music there was no bray of brass
  such as tore the ear at Crawford's across the street, but singing violins
  ruled the orchestra.</p>

  <p>Dulled by the intervening wall, the one solid and abiding feature of
  Lefhvre's house, the music came dimly into the game room, a moan of strings,
  a faint whistle of the clarinets, or the pulse of the drums, so that varying
  melody pervaded the air of the game room.</p>

  <p>On four things Lefhvre spent with a prodigal hand&mdash;his music, his
  waxed dance floor, his liquor, and his gambling equipment of tables and
  machines. In his house men dallied with chance, lured and prompted to
  carelessness by the promise of the distant music. If they lost, they sought
  courage at the bar and returned to the gambling table to lose with greater
  rapidity. If they won, they went to the bar to celebrate the victory and
  returned to the table with a dazed brain and lost. But in the end they
  arrived at one of two stations&mdash;either they had spent all but the fag
  end of their stake and sought the dance hall to go broke in style, or else as
  winners they went for a few turns in the hall to display their wealth. But no
  matter what they did or where they turned, the net of Monsieur Lefhvre was
  spread, and small were the winnings that escaped through the doors of his
  establishment.</p>

  <p>To Lee Garrison the music was like a breath of perfume. It was a promise
  of Alice, and, if she had been lovely as framed in the darkness of the
  window, how thrice more beautiful in the splendor of that shining room beyond
  the door.</p>

  <p>As Lee drank in the scene, smiling with half-drunken joy, McLeod had
  drifted to a little distance, letting himself be carried along by the next
  eddy that came through the door. It was the expectancy in his glance which
  aroused Lee Garrison to the memory that he had come for a distinct purpose.
  No doubt to McLeod the smile of Lee was that of one looking down on the
  battlefield where he sees victory.</p>

  <p>That thought made Lee laugh aloud. And this was to be the second time in
  his life that he had gambled. What should he try? Where should he lose his
  little fortune? There was one main center of interest among the machines. The
  chuck-a-luck table languished with only two or three dogged patrons. Faro had
  its meager half dozen advocates. But the thick group in the exact middle of
  the room surrounded the roulette wheel. Lee Garrison made for it. From the
  side came McLeod, his face dark with doubt.</p>

  <p>Lee swallowed a smile. He would begin in a small way, but he hardly knew
  how to play the machine. There were colors on each side of him marked off in
  little squares in which bets were laid. There were also squares on which
  numbers were marked. On one of these a neighbor deposited a dollar, and Lee
  promptly put ten dollars on the adjoining spot, covering the figure nine.
  From the corner of his eye he saw McLeod hesitate, and then shake his head.
  Evidently this was water too deep for him. Now the wheel spun, slowed, and
  stopped with a click. His neighbor's dollar disappeared under the expert
  stick of the man behind the wheel, but upon his own ten dollars, an instant
  later, three one-hundred-dollar bills and six tens were deposited. He had
  been paid thirty-six for one!</p>

  <p>A flurry of placing bets recommenced. The man behind the wheel in a quiet
  voice was urging his patrons to get their money down more quickly, but Lee
  chiefly heard the man beside him saying: "Heaven a'mighty, stranger, you
  letting her ride?"</p>

  <p>"Not this time," said Lee, and shifted his pile to a new spot. The wheel
  spun again, hissed, slow, and stopped with a gentle click as the ball
  dropped. But this time the stopping of the wheel brought a great commotion. A
  dozen people were talking at once. Something had gone wrong, perhaps? There
  was a protest.</p>

  <p>The immediate companions of Lee had pushed a few feet back from him, and
  all eyes were fastened steadily on him for a blazing moment of envy and
  surprise. The man behind the wheel, after deftly taking in the lost bets,
  began as swiftly paying the winners. Three or four had won on the color, two
  on the odd, and now he placed a neat pile of double eagles before McLeod, who
  was utterly colorless except for a purple patch high upon his cheek. After
  that, the payer flashed over his stacks of money swiftly, then sent an
  assistant scurrying across the floor. He seemed to spread silence with
  him.</p>

  <p>The news ran along invisible wires of rumor. The card games came to a
  pause, and the heads of the players turned. And again it was Lee who was the
  focus of interest.</p>

  <p>"I've seen it tried," said Lee's nearest companion, "but this is the first
  time I ever seen it worked. Two times running. And here comes the old
  man!"</p>

  <p>The messenger, walking heavily under a burden, was returning at the rear
  of a portly man who paddled across the floor on little short legs and
  ridiculously small feet. He nodded to patrons on either side with a courtly
  gesture to accompany each salutation.</p>

  <p>"Ain't he the game old sport?" said the murmurers around Lee. "Old French
  himself is coming out to pay. Maybe he wants you to take his note, Garrison!"
  But here was Lefhvre, extending his hand. Lee's fingers sank into soft, cold
  flesh.</p>

  <p>"I've heard of you before, Mister Garrison," said the proprietor, "and
  I've been hoping that we should see you here. I see that you have made your
  own welcome, in a way&mdash;" Here he laughed a little and was accompanied by
  the polite murmur of the crowd. "Although I am a little late, let me add my
  congratulations, sir!"</p>

  <p>So saying, he took a heavy canvas sack from his messenger and gave it to
  Lee. "Thirteen thousand, three hundred and twenty dollars," he said, loudly
  enough to be heard distinctly for some distance, "and now won't you drink
  with me?"</p>

  <p>Lee found himself carried off in the midst of a hearty muttering of
  applause for Lefhvre. Lee Garrison protested. "I sure hate to do this, Mister
  Lefhvre," he said. "The luck&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut," the gambler assured him with a handsome frankness. "It is the
  fortunes of war. Today you win, and tomorrow I win. Do not pity me, Mister
  Garrison, but be happy without a cloud. There are some poor fellows who creep
  in and out of here with their heads down and their last penny gone. On my
  honor, I am sorry for them, and they know they can come to Lefhvre for help,
  but their honest Western pride forbids that, it seems. However, Mister
  Garrison, you will go out in a different manner. To your good health, sir,
  although I'm afraid I can't drink to your continued luck!"</p>

  <p>The remark set the crowd laughing as their glasses flashed to their
  lips&mdash;a roomful of men and a streak of crystal light rising in every
  hand for, when Lefhvre treated, the whole house drank.</p>

  <p>He would not accept a drink which Lee offered to buy, however, and
  immediately left the room. If someone had proposed a cheer for the proprietor
  at that moment, it would have been given with a mighty will. So gracious did
  he seem that it threw a peculiar imputation of craft and unfair cunning on
  Garrison by contrast, a slight cloud from which Lee could partially extricate
  himself by leaving the odd three hundred and twenty dollars with the
  bartender "to treat the boys when they looked downhearted!" Even this royal
  generosity made only a slight impression, for a big winner in gambling is too
  envied to be liked.</p>

  <p>If he had instantly and joyously devoted himself to the labor of getting
  drunk in celebration, he would have been looked upon with a more kindly eye,
  but the complete daze in which Lee found himself was misinterpreted as
  professional nonchalance. If there were needed proof of Slocum's report that
  Garrison was a seasoned expert, it was herein provided. But Lee was not
  thinking of the opinions of others. That unworldly mind of his was merely
  grasping at the fact that he had come here to rid himself of money that was
  too unclean to be carried into the presence of the girl.</p>

  <p>He sighed and looked around into the smoke-blue atmosphere of Lefhvre's.
  Every light was encircled by a luminous, milk-white fog. Yonder was McLeod,
  idling in front of a crap table, but he was keeping strict watch on his
  master. Lee Garrison made straight for that table, counted out fifty
  twenty-dollar gold pieces, and wagered them against the point of the house,
  which was eight. That thousand vanished. He replaced it, and the next
  thousand was swept away. He repeated for the third time. At one side he saw
  McLeod, who had been following these bets in a smaller way, break into a
  perspiration that made his face gleam, and Lee, as his fourth thousand
  disappeared, laughed joyously and bet again. He heard a murmur that said: "So
  sure of his system that he don't give a damn! That ain't gambling&mdash;it's
  gold digging. I told you so!"</p>

  <p>For as he spoke, Lee won, let his bet ride and won again, doubled,
  recouping his losses at a stroke. And then he settled down seriously to the
  work of throwing his money away.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; ALICE AGAIN</h2>

  <p class="first">But the curse of Midas had descended upon Lee Garrison
  unasked, and whatever he touched turned into gold. At faro, to be sure, he
  managed to lose five thousand in a moment, but, when he won on the next turn
  of the card, he turned away in despair, while the man at the deck gaped to
  see the gambler leave at the very moment his luck changed. From faro he went
  to chuck-a-luck, where, having placed his accustomed thousand on the five,
  instantly two fives danced to the top of the next cast, and when he left his
  stake and winnings in the hope of seeing them disappear&mdash;they doubled
  again!</p>

  <p>After this he went from table to table, literally throwing money away, but
  though he lost here, he won there. He could not even carry his winnings about
  with him, for gold coin weighs ninety pounds to every ten thousand dollars.
  So he hired one of Lefhvre's own men to stand guard over that precious canvas
  bag while Lee went about with sack pockets sagging with a load of gold.
  Although he sowed it by blind handfuls, he could not lose it. At eight
  o'clock he had to shake his head in surrender. Alice, without stain and
  without reproach, was waiting for him, and he must go. Gloomily he started
  for the dance hall, with twenty times the money which he had come to lose. He
  passed the ecstatic form of McLeod, who had been exactly imitating the
  betting of Lee on a smaller scale, and who now muttered: "You're a master,
  Garrison. Nobody under heaven could make out your system&mdash;I've racked my
  brains over it and got nothing but&mdash;cash."</p>

  <p>That was the common sentiment. They had seen greater winnings in Monsieur
  Lefhvre's, but they had never seen winnings taken in with so careless a hand.
  And what a system it was that, in the space of fifteen or twenty minutes,
  allowed the master to turn at will from one game to another, so completely
  the lord of all that it seemed his will was imposed on the whirl of the
  roulette wheel and on the arrangement of the faro pack. This, combined with
  his youth, and then the known facts about the affair at Crawford's, caused
  them to stare joyously after him as he reached the big door leading to the
  dance hall, paused there a moment, and finally, with a lift of his head,
  disappeared into the brighter atmosphere of the adjoining room.</p>

  <p>Lee saw her instantly, whirling in a yellow dress, or was it beaten gold
  made to flow softly as spider web about her? She spun down the center of the
  room in the arms of a handsome youth. The music, as though to greet his
  entrance, climbed to a rich crescendo, and the pulse of the drum grew
  hurried. She danced with a glistening arm outstretched, sheen in her hair,
  her face flushed. Then he looked more closely at her companion.</p>

  <p>He was magnificent; he stood, one knew at once, exactly the romantic and
  perfect height of six feet. He was in the poetry of the early twenties, so
  that a woman could call him either man or boy, as her cunning fancy chose.
  Straight as an aspen he was and shouldered like an oak. His features were of
  statuesque perfection, with the straight nose and the long, strong sweep of
  the jawline that Grecian sculptors loved to strike out with their chisels.
  Considering that this magnificent fellow was set off by graceful dancing,
  easy manners, and above all by precisely fitted Sunday clothes, Lee Garrison
  had reason to pause and watch that radiant pair weave through the crowd. How
  deft, how careless a guide was this big stranger. How could human brain at
  one and the same time conceive the elaborate passages through which his feet
  were going in rhythm with the galloping music, and, at the same time maintain
  a steady and smiling flow of conversation.</p>

  <p>The heart of Lee sank. His own harsh features were shown to him in a
  mirror: cheekbones too high, eye staring and sunken, chin too lean.</p>

  <p>Heads were turning toward him. Every one of them knew him, so it seemed,
  and each glance was accompanied by a subdued murmur. No doubt they were
  rehearsing the episode in Crawford's. He groaned as he hunted for a vacant
  table along the side of the room.</p>

  <p>A voice detached itself from the conglomerate murmur, and there she came
  with the handsome youth only vaguely in view behind her. He would have known
  her by her radiant body, Lee decided, had her face been masked in black.</p>

  <p>She took possession of him in a swirl of words and gestures. "Here he is!
  This is Harry Chandler. I told him I was waiting for you to come, and he's
  been taking care of me. Wasn't that sweet of him? Do you have to go right
  now, Mister Chandler?"</p>

  <p>Lee watched Harry Chandler in wonder and sympathy, wonder that so
  magnificent a hero should be dismissed in his favor, and because he knew how
  embarrassed, awkward, and venomous he himself would have been had he stood in
  the boots of Mr. Chandler. To his considerable amazement young Chandler
  showed no dismay or confusion whatever. He acknowledged the introduction with
  a nod, and, while he ran an indifferent eye over Lee, he produced a
  cigarette, lighted it, and tossed the match toward a nearby table.</p>

  <p>"Sorry we're losing the last of that dance, Alice," he said. "But tomorrow
  night is another night. So long!"</p>

  <p>And he drifted off, leaving Lee with the feeling that, although he
  possessed the field, the laurel had been denied him.</p>

  <p>"Want to finish this out?" asked bright-haired Alice.</p>

  <p>He shook his head, saying that he did not dance. For certainly he would
  not invite invidious comparisons between his clumsiness and the skill of
  Chandler. That declaration cast something of a cloud over her, in the midst
  of which she guided him to her table, and he presently found himself opposite
  her cigarette and her smile.</p>

  <p>The golden mist was vanished from her&mdash;how small a wind of truth had
  been needed to clear it away. Lee was seeing Alice of the window for the
  first time. Her blue eyes were a little faded, and about the corners was a
  tracery of weary crow's-foot wrinkles. Her mouth was wider than strict
  necessity required, and the upper lip was a little crooked, verging toward a
  faint sneer where an irregularity of the teeth pushed it up a trifle. To be
  sure her complexion was as delicate as the rose flush of Aurora, but its
  perfection was now, alas, swiftly explained. For, leaning back in the chair,
  she produced a rouge box and powder, together with a mirror, and, holding
  this at arm's length and turning her head critically from side to side, ten
  seconds of accurate work replaced her damp and ragged flush with a dry and
  even one, restoring the pearl to forehead and chin. She closed the little
  case with a sigh of satisfaction and snuggled the chain over her hand
  again.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman friend in Omaha gave it to me," said Alice. "He got tired of
  seeing me lose my bag, and so he went to a jeweler and got this thing. Ain't
  it sweet?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Lee, leaning back as she leaned forward. "It looks pretty
  good."</p>

  <p>A change passed over her as suddenly as the flick of a cloud shadow across
  the window. For a moment she studied him with coldly intent eyes, balancing a
  judgment.</p>

  <p>Lee felt that disaster lurked ahead, and he did his best to stave it off
  by making conversation. "This Chandler you were dancing with&mdash;that's
  Handsome Harry, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"That's Handsome Harry," she answered. "He's a swell, all right."</p>

  <p>She looked past Lee with eyes made big by contemplating the full glory of
  Harry. Lee himself was remembering stray bits of talk he had heard here and
  there about the town. This was the same man who had hunted Moonshine and,
  mounted on a wonderfully fleet mare known by the strange name of Laughter,
  had run the stallion for three days.</p>

  <p>"He's got the blood," went on Alice of the window, "and the blood tells.
  His father was a gentleman before him, and his grandfather before that. Old
  man Chandler came out here and started trying to raise Thoroughbreds in the
  desert, but he went broke. Any real gentleman goes broke, when he gets into
  business. All that poor Harry has is one horse and his face. But that one
  horse is Laughter. I guess you've heard about her. I've seen her!"</p>

  <p>Alice's enthusiasm for Harry faded a little. She yawned in the face of Lee
  and leaned back in her chair. What might have happened then no one could have
  told, had not a man from the gambling room said to Lee in passing:
  "Celebrating, eh? They're still talking about how you cleaned up the games,
  in yonder."</p>

  <p>That sentence brought a delightful smile to the lips of Alice. She leaned
  toward Lee again with a dainty forefinger shaken in mock reproof. "So you've
  trimmed 'em, you naughty boy?"</p>

  <p>He saw her rather than heard her. There had gathered over him a sick
  darkness of disappointment as he realized that Alice of the window could not
  be the end of the trail that began with the glove and the shack. That gloom
  parted a little, and he saw her raised hand, and no more.</p>

  <p>Time, which had written of himself upon her face, had dealt gently with
  her hands. Her idle fingers, untrammeled by work, were girlish in
  slenderness, pink-tipped, and pointed. Now he saw a palm of transparent
  delicacy, with a blue hint of veins. No matter if the golden vanity case that
  another man had given her dangled from the round, small wrist. As though a
  wand had passed over him, Lee Garrison saw her again as she had been, when
  she leaned above him from the window, laughing.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; THE TOUCH OF MIDAS</h2>

  <p class="first">Enchantment, indeed, was there, and money was the enchanter.
  Not the lost trapper, flagging on the trail, when he sees the smoke twist
  above the unknown hills, or the mariner, when the light glints through the
  dark of the storm, is so transformed as was Alice of the window by the
  thought of the gambler's winnings. There was no need of rouge now to stain
  her cheeks. Her eyes glistened, and her voice was sweeter. She was restored
  for a dazzling moment to what she had been when face and voice mated that
  lovely hand. And Lee Garrison cast from his mind the first horrible
  suspicion. For that which was so beautiful must surely be good. Perhaps the
  glove in his pocket would perfectly fit that hand. Yet he was held back from
  the trial by a thread of doubt.</p>

  <p>"Trimmed 'em?" he said. "Yes, I can't help winning. Money walks into my
  pockets, even when I try to keep it out."</p>

  <p>Her laughter was music, clear and sweet. "A good pick up, dearie?"</p>

  <p>Why did she use those foolish familiar words when she hardly knew him?
  However, he must not criticize. Words were nothing, and he would wash the
  strangeness from her talk.</p>

  <p>"Whiskey," he said to the waiter, "in a hurry." And to the girl: "Did I
  pick up much? Look!"</p>

  <p>He thrust a hand into a coat pocket, and it came out dense and bristling
  with coins. Alice made a trembling, cherishing gesture.</p>

  <p>"And lots more than that," said Lee. "Lots more. But it's bad stuff,
  Alice!"</p>

  <p>"What sort of kidding d'you call that?" she asked a little hoarsely, and
  she strained her eyes away from that mass of money and forced herself to
  smile into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"It isn't a joke," he assured her. "Money you get by gambling, money you
  get without work&mdash;well, it can't do you any good, you see?"</p>

  <p>Again she laughed, just as she had at the window. Everything and anything
  made her laugh, and the sound flooded through him as the golden sunshine of a
  morning pours a room full of warmth.</p>

  <p>"Ever hear of it doing any bad, Lee? You are a kidder!"</p>

  <p>"But I mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Take a drink, dearie, and explain later&mdash;always do your drinking
  first. Here you are, Joe&mdash;and keep an eye on us, will you? My friend is
  dry."</p>

  <p>She picked up a twenty from the hand of Garrison and gave it to the
  waiter, who opened his eyes and fled before she should take back the
  donation. Lee swept the glass to his lips and then saw that she was drinking
  with him. Was that right? Should a woman drink? He forgot to wonder about
  that point as the hot stuff burned its way home in him.</p>

  <p>"No chaser," he said, as she pushed the little glass of water toward him.
  "I like it straight&mdash;I like to watch the way it works inside."</p>

  <p>"You're all man, aren't you?" smiled the girl. "I high-signed Joe to make
  yours double. I knew your style, honey!"</p>

  <p>He harked back to the money. He must prove he was right. "What I said
  about getting something for nothing."</p>

  <p>"Listen, Lee," broke in the soft voice of the girl, "I don't fall for that
  sort of stuff. You don't have to pull the Sunday school line to make me see
  that you're all O K. If that money is poison&mdash;well, it'd sure take an
  awful mob of it to make me sick!"</p>

  <p>"D'you want it?" he asked curiously. "Would you like to have it?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes widened a trifle. "You can't tease me," she declared, and managed
  a rather shaky laugh. "I haven't asked you for it, have I?"</p>

  <p>"If you want it, take it." He automatically caught up the refilled glass
  beside him and tossed off the dram. "Take it all! You know why I give it to
  you? You're too beautiful to be harmed by such stuff. Too beautiful and pure
  and good, Alice, for this dirty money to be bad for you. Gimme that bag."</p>

  <p>She slipped it off with fingers that stumbled at their work, and she
  watched with incredulous, childish eyes as he opened it and then crammed into
  the interior a jumbled mass of money. It jammed the bag, swelling it stiffly,
  and, still wide as it gaped, it could not swallow everything. Half a dozen
  coins dropped clanging on the table.</p>

  <p>"If you want them," said Lee, "take 'em."</p>

  <p>She began to gather the overflowed gold with a stilted pretense of a
  smile, ready to drop her spoil, if he showed sign of anger. But there was no
  anger in him. He watched her with a smile as she packed the money tighter and
  tighter into the little golden vanity case and finally managed to squeeze the
  lips of it shut. She pressed it against her cheek and stared at him with a
  startled, happy look.</p>

  <p>"You're wonderful," said Alice of the window. "I never knew anybody as
  wonderful as you are, Lee!"</p>

  <p>He shook his head energetically and drank again. The floor around him was
  alive with people who were moving out for a new dance, and they all traveled
  by ways which would bring them as close as possible to the table of Garrison,
  for the whole crowd had seen the episode of the money. Their hearts might
  have been warmed at the sight of such foolish spending, but it merely angered
  them to see him throw away without thought what he had won, they believed,
  without risk.</p>

  <p>And he was saying: "You don't understand, Alice. I'm not a gunfighter or a
  dead-sure gambler. Everybody's wrong. They don't really know me, you see. I'm
  as simple as anyone could be. Never hunted trouble in my life and never
  learned a gambling trick or a gambling system. Will you believe me?"</p>

  <p>"I'll believe anything," said Alice. "Why, you don't have to argue with
  me, Lee. If you want to kid me along, go ahead!"</p>

  <p>She leaned back, smiling luxuriously, and lighted another cigarette.
  Immense hopes began to form in her mind. Who could tell? This man was
  something new. He was never serious, but he kept jesting with a strange,
  sober face. If she had not known a little about his exploit in Crawford's,
  she might have been duped, might have taken him seriously. She was worried by
  only one thing&mdash;why should he have chosen her above the rest? There were
  prettier girls in the room, younger girls. But she repeated to herself: You
  can't judge a man by his choice of a woman. Besides, this cunning fellow is
  looking deeper than faces. He sees I ain't like the rest of these.</p>

  <p>Suppose, then, that his semi-seriousness became true seriousness? Suppose
  that her fortunes were hitched to this wild, rising star? Two words rose in
  her mind, each with a thousand dream-bright pictures&mdash;Monte Carlo and
  Paris. She saw herself in a great hall, seated at a table covered with
  milk-white linen, liveried servants passing with muffled step or hanging
  shadow-like behind the chairs.</p>

  <p>Between two flickings of cigarette ash that dream poured through the brain
  of Alice. She had entirely forgotten the princely gift that now gorged her
  vanity case. There were greater goals ahead. In the first place she changed
  her mind about one essential. She must not allow him to get too drunk.
  Granted that she could in this manner pluck all his winnings of the evening,
  she must not allow him to waken in the morning disillusioned, and so kill the
  goose of the golden eggs.</p>

  <p>"I'm not kidding," he had said in answer to her last remark. She heard him
  distantly through her dream. "But we won't talk any more about me. I want to
  know about you, Alice. Tell me everything about yourself."</p>

  <p>He had opened a floodgate. It was her favorite topic.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was later in that happy, happy evening, and her story was drawing
  toward its close. Thrice the saucer that held her cigarette ashes and butt
  had been changed. She had grown inured to the curious glances of the women.
  The table had become a throne to Alice, and her dominion was over the
  fire-eyed youth who listened so intently to her words. No doubt he was
  playing the game of cat and mouse, in a way, but to a certain extent it was
  impossible to doubt his sincerity unless he could continue to act a rC4le and
  grow drunk at the same time.</p>

  <p>For he was indubitably growing drunk. In spite of her cautioning, which
  made the tip-dizzy Joe cut the portions of Garrison to a mere wash of liquor
  in the bottom of the glass, the talk of Garrison became thicker. He
  articulated as though his upper lip had become numb.</p>

  <p>"I'm not used to the stuff," he said, and she was forced against her will
  to believe him. After all, was it not true that most gamblers avoided
  drink?</p>

  <p>"Time for us to be running along, honey," she told him. "You're under the
  weather."</p>

  <p>He protested stubbornly that he was sober as a judge. "But I'll go," he
  said, "as soon as you finish your story. You'd just got to the place where
  Crawford came up to you."</p>

  <p>She fired with indignation as she recalled the incident, quite forgetting
  Lee, for the moment, except as a sympathetic listener.</p>

  <p>"The big stiff walked up to me with that ugly grin of his. He says&mdash;
  'You got to key down, Blondie&mdash;you're making too much noise.' Can you
  imagine that? Him calling me Blondie and telling me to key down? I was so mad
  I just give him a look until I caught my breath. 'Why, you big ham,' says I,
  'if the floor of your dump was paved with faces like yours, it wouldn't be
  good enough for me to walk on!'"</p>

  <p>Alice laughed a little as she recalled the brilliance of that retort.
  "'Look here,' says Crawford, 'you do what I tell you&mdash;you key down or
  get out of my place!'</p>

  <p>"'Oh, is that so?' says I. 'I'll certainly be moving, then. The point is
  that you ain't used to having ladies in your hold-up of a dive. But the
  day'll come when you come begging me to pass a good word for you around among
  the boys,' says I, 'and then there won't be no noise about good talking.'</p>

  <p>"'Shut up,' says he, 'and get out! You're drunk!'</p>

  <p>"I jabbed my heel into the foot of the flathead that was keeping me
  company that night. The boob was dead to the world. He'd been mixing his
  drinks. All I could do was to stand up and give Crawford one look and walk
  out."</p>

  <p>Alice paused. The expression of Lee Garrison was part the daze of liquor
  and part bewilderment, with not nearly as much anger as she had expected. Had
  she said anything that might shock or offend him? She cast back over her
  remarks. No, her narrative had only been the spirited account of an indignity
  offered to a lady. Alice, herself, had been drinking a bit beyond her
  average.</p>

  <p>She varied her tone. "And that's what I've come to, Lee. After my bringing
  up and the home that I was used to, that's what I've come to&mdash;a low-
  life like Crawford, daring to&mdash;And what d'you think he said as I went
  out? 'Never come back!' says he. 'Your back going out is the most I want to
  see of you.'"</p>

  <p>Lee Garrison dropped his fist on the table. "Did he say that? Why, the
  insulting hound!" Righteous indignation burned through him. The narration of
  Alice had been dim in his ears for some time, but now he recalled himself.
  She had been driven out of Crawford's by the proprietor&mdash;driven out by a
  man. Looking at her through a haze, the dazzling white of her arms and
  shoulders blinded him. Oh, cowardly brutality to have so shamed and
  maltreated this innocent and charming girl.</p>

  <p>He started to his feet. "Meet me at the door," he said, and was gone.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; HE FINDS TRUE GOLD</h2>

  <p class="first">Appalled, Alice cried after him, but he was beyond reach,
  cleaving a downright road through the midst of the dancers and aiming at the
  door. Gertie swung out of a dance and appeared before her friend. She sent
  her escort on an errand to a far corner and so secured a moment for quiet
  chat with her companion.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, breathing hard from her exercise, "ain't you got enough
  out of him? Can't you let him go now? I'd be ashamed, Alice, as greedy as
  that!"</p>

  <p>Alice sank back into her chair. "Shut up, Gertie," she said. "You make me
  tired. Besides, you don't know nothing."</p>

  <p>"Don't I? I know that you made a fat haul&mdash;unless he pushed some
  queer on you."</p>

  <p>Alice gasped, jerked open the vanity case, hastily and critically examined
  some of the broad pieces with which it was loaded, and then sank back with a
  long sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"My heavens, Gertie," she said, "you might as well kill me as to scare me
  stiff! No, that boodle is straight stuff. The only thing that's queer is
  Garrison. I can't figure him&mdash;either a simp or a nut or a wise guy too
  deep for yours truly."</p>

  <p>"A simp for blowing himself like that?" said Gertie, her eyes dim with
  desire as she gazed at the vanity case. "But honest, dearie, how did you get
  it out of him? Or don't money mean nothing to that gold digger?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno&mdash;nothing. My head's swimming."</p>

  <p>"You better go home. I've got a lemon. I'll shed him and take you
  home&mdash; you been drinking too much, Alice." Gertie softened her voice to
  the gentlest sympathy, because, with Alice so suddenly flush, it would be the
  height of folly not to establish the best diplomatic relations.</p>

  <p>Alice shook her bright head decisively. "He told me to meet him at the
  door."</p>

  <p>"And you're going to? He'll be sober, when he comes back, and he'll grab
  every cent he gave you."</p>

  <p>Alice dropped her cigarette from lifeless fingers. But she recovered her
  assurance at once and shrugged her shoulders. "I'll stick," she declared.
  "You don't know him, Gertie. All I'm afraid of is that he's gone gunning for
  that fat pig, Crawford, and he may go after me, if he comes back and finds me
  gone. Never can tell about a killer like him."</p>

  <p>"My heavens, dearie," panted Gertie. "D'you mean to say he's gone
  to&mdash;and you ain't sent a warning to Crawford?"</p>

  <p>"Warning? I would have stopped Garrison, if I could, but now that he's
  gone, I hope he turns Crawford into a sieve. Why, what he said to me,
  Gertie&mdash;but I'm going out to see what's what."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>She reached the door of Lefhvre's barely in time to meet Lee Garrison with
  a gun belted around his waist, his hair blown awry by the night wind, his
  eyes flaring, his shirt opened to the air at the throat. And beside him was
  Moonshine! The left hand of the master, twined in his mane, steadied the
  frightened stallion. It was like hanging a sword from a thread, and Alice of
  the window shrank away. A word had been passed. A crowd was flocking out of
  Lefhvre's.</p>

  <p>"You're coming with me," commanded Lee. "Get up on Moonshine, Alice."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lee&mdash;he'll tear me to bits, if I come near him&mdash;he'll kill
  me, Lee!"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk foolish, but gimme your foot. There you are, Moonshine, stand
  still."</p>

  <p>The stallion obeyed, but he crouched till he well-nigh touched the street
  in his terror. That made it easier to put the girl on his back, and there she
  sat sideways, clutching at the mane close to his withers to steady herself,
  and shaken violently by the tremor of the stallion.</p>

  <p>"You keep quiet and you're all right," said Lee. "You aren't going to get
  hurt. Come along, Moonshine."</p>

  <p>And the stallion, snorting and prancing, stole along beside the master.
  Monsieur Lefhvre himself, who had hurried toward the noise and had begun
  applauding, for he had a Frenchman's eye for effects. The example was
  followed with cheers and clapping of hands and stamping of feet, for, after
  all, it made a very pretty picture&mdash;the yellow-haired girl on that
  shining beauty of a horse, and the wild figure of Lee Garrison walking
  ahead.</p>

  <p>They poured out behind the horse and into the street, while the broad
  shaft of light from the dance hall streamed clearly after them and showed the
  way to Crawford's place opposite. Straight on went Lee Garrison, reached the
  flight of half a dozen steps leading to Crawford's door, and behold Moonshine
  climbing those steps, one by one, trembling with terror, but going steadily
  on in obedience to the hand on his mane. The applause became a roar. Men
  rushed for the doors and the windows of Crawford's to see the effect of that
  entrance.</p>

  <p>The orchestra, chiefly brass, blared its music from the far end of the
  hall and kept a narrow maze of dancers in motion up and down its length,
  while packed tables on either side accommodated gamblers or drinkers.</p>

  <p>Breaking through the rolling fog of tobacco smoke, the watchers saw man
  and horse and girl led straight down the hall, while the dancers packed back
  to clear a lane, and the music shrieked to a pause. Garrison stopped opposite
  the big chair in which Crawford sat enthroned, a gross body with his head
  inclined and his chin resting on his breast. In that position he continued
  for endless hours, rolling his glances from side to side and missing
  nothing.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the horse and the woman he jerked up his head and shouted
  to half a dozen onlookers. But not a one moved. They were too intent on the
  words of Lee.</p>

  <p>"I've been hearing a pile of bad things about you, Crawford," said Lee.
  Before the sound of his voice a wave of silence spread, and even the watchers
  at the windows could hear. "Mostly I've been told that you threw this lady
  out of your place, Crawford. Lemme tell you&mdash;in this part of the country
  you can't treat a lady like that, understand?"</p>

  <p>From one end of the hall to the other rolled a deep groan of assent. It
  pleases the true Westerner to have chivalry attributed to him. He feels it to
  be just compensation for rough clothes, rough manners.</p>

  <p>Besides, there is a grain of truth in the fable, for there are fewer women
  than men on the frontiers. Now Lee was making himself spokesman for the
  honorable sentiment, and he received commendation accordingly. Crawford,
  rolling his bright little eyes up and down the double rows of faces,
  instantly saw the drift of feeling and determined to give way before it. He
  was a braver man save when courage interfered with business.</p>

  <p>"Young feller," he said, "you're talking loud and long about nothing much.
  Who said that she couldn't come back here? Sure she can, and she's
  welcome!"</p>

  <p>"Hear him crawl!" cried Alice. "He's yellow, too, the big
  four-flusher!"</p>

  <p>"I sure doubt you, partner," said Lee with much gravity. "But I'm here to
  state that the lady's come back because she felt like coming, and she's going
  out again, when she feels like going, but first there's an apology coming to
  her. Let me hear it!"</p>

  <p>The hand of Crawford twitched halfway to his gun&mdash;and paused. A
  remembered picture had crossed his mind of terrible young King Peters lying
  on the floor of his saloon that very day and shooting from the hip while this
  wild man, barehanded, ran in on him. The perspiring face of Crawford grew
  pale as tallow. In a great distance he saw the scorn in the faces of the men
  around him, but grimly near at hand were the fingers of Garrison, trembling
  just above the butt of his gun.</p>

  <p>"Why," said Crawford, "I'm sure sorry, if the lady's feelings have been
  hurt."</p>

  <p>"That's enough," said Garrison, and he turned Moonshine back toward the
  door. He did not see Crawford roll out of his chair and tug out his gun. He
  did not see two of Crawford's bouncers throw themselves on the man with
  curses and tear the weapon from his hand. It seemed to Lee that the uproar
  through which he passed was all a thunder of applause for Moonshine and the
  adorable beauty on his back.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Alice, as they came out under the stars again, that it was
  the greatest night of her life. She could feel beauty that had vanished ten
  years before, returning to her now, untarnished. And she began to feel both
  gratitude and awe for Lee. He was partly drunk and partly different, but he
  had placed her in an epic light tonight. She had been only one among many in
  the evening. In the morning she would be famous.</p>

  <p>As for Lee, the fumes of the whiskey were mounting more and more to his
  head, and, although the excitement of that incursion into Crawford's had
  nerved him, still alcohol colored all that he saw and did. And, as it
  operates on many nervous temperaments, it made him white of face and bright
  of eye as he started across the street for Lefhvre's again with his way
  fenced in on either side by men and girls from both dance halls, by other
  townsfolk who had been attracted by the uproar, and, in fact, by everyone who
  happened to be astir in the town. There were even half a dozen gaping
  children, drawn out by the uproar, and girls dressed brightly, and scores of
  laughing men. Immense brotherliness welled in him. They had misunderstood him
  for a time, but now there was more applause than criticism in their
  laughter&mdash;even the formidable old barber was chuckling and nodding
  approval. Indeed, among them all there was only one who sneered&mdash;Harry
  Chandler, who now drew back with the girl who stood beside him. But it was
  not the sneer of Handsome Harry that cleared the whiskey from the head of Lee
  Garrison. It was the face of the girl beside the big fellow. For this was she
  whom he had hunted. She was the incarnate thought that had sprung into his
  mind when he had found the glove in the distant cabin, and the sight of her
  was to him like a friend's voice in a foreign land. Only a glimpse of her
  beauty and her scorn. Then she turned with Harry Chandler. But even with her
  head turned there was something sadly familiar. It was as though he had known
  her once and had been close and dear to her. And in her place sat Alice of
  the window, on Moonshine.</p>

  <p>He turned and looked up to her. Oh, fool, fool, to have thought that this
  was the goal of the quest, or even a station by the way.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; HE ACQUIRES A PARTNER</h2>

  <p class="first">Sick at heart, he turned Moonshine up the street through the
  jam of people that split away before him. He was suddenly beyond the
  crowd.</p>

  <p>"Lee, Lee!" called the anxious voice of the girl. "I can't wander around
  without a coat. I'll freeze. Go back to Lefhvre's."</p>

  <p>He looked around. The entrances of both houses of pleasure were black with
  returning people. Already their uproar and exclamations were far off and
  blurring like something half remembered. He did not speak at once, and Alice,
  in quick alarm, slipped from the back of the stallion and came to him.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" she asked anxiously. "Are you sick, Lee? Don't look back
  there at them&mdash;look here at me."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "I guess I'm sick. Where d'you want to go&mdash;back to
  Lefhvre's or home?"</p>

  <p>"Home&mdash;if you're sick. But ain't it rotten luck that we've gotta miss
  what the boys will be saying? Come on, then! Is the booze getting to you?
  Don't you worry about nothing&mdash;I'll take care of you. Turn to your
  right. Here we are!"</p>

  <p>He stopped at the door of her rooming house. "Good night," he said. "It
  was a fine party."</p>

  <p>She caught his arm. "You seen someone else just now!"</p>

  <p>As that made him start, panic swept her away at the thought of losing this
  gold mine.</p>

  <p>"Don't be making a fool of yourself, honey," she said, attempting to
  fondle him. "That stuff at Lefhvre's went to your head, and you don't know
  what you're doing&mdash;if I let you go back to that crowd, they'll pick you
  clean. You'll lose every cent you.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He drew back a little from her until a dull light from the nearest window
  fell on his face, and she saw in it enough to make her release his arm with a
  gasp. Then rage was born from hopelessness.</p>

  <p>"Go back, then!" she shrilled. "Go back and find some flat-faced booby
  who'll get out of you all that I couldn't get." She slipped into the
  half-open door, holding it ready to slam in his face. "You pin-head!" cried
  Alice of the window. "I'd've trimmed you right to your skin in another hour.
  Go back and find her, and I hope she hooks you for good and keeps you working
  overtime like the sucker you are!"</p>

  <p>Instead of advancing, he turned to Moonshine and hooked his arm over the
  neck of the stallion. They went off together like two friends, and she heard
  him saying: "It's better to be a horse than to be a man and born blind, like
  I am. There isn't anybody as big a fool as I am. Why, I'll be thinking a
  light in a kitchen is a star in the sky, pretty soon."</p>

  <p>"Crazy," muttered Alice. "Plain nutty." She slammed the door. And
  straightway she burst into tears. "I wish I was dead," sobbed Alice as she
  dragged herself slowly up the steps, but the vanity case was tight in her
  grip.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Who can prophesy what our dreams will be? Even an agony of remorse could
  not keep Lee awake, and, when he slept, he met, in a bright vision, the girl
  with Handsome Harry. He saw her leave Harry and come to him. And he took out
  the glove and tried it on her hand. Behold! Her hand fitted it as the foot of
  astonished little Cinderella fitted the slipper. Only the pink tip of one
  finger showed through the torn end.</p>

  <p>He wakened in a flood of golden sunshine and in a mood of no less golden
  happiness that started him laughing softly.</p>

  <p>"Well," drawled a voice. "You got cause for laughing, I guess."</p>

  <p>He heaved himself up on one elbow and saw old Bad Luck Billy Sidney tilted
  back in a chair in the full glare of the sunshine, his hat on the back of his
  head, and his knife leisurely employed in whittling a stick of soft pine into
  grotesque shapes. Lee Garrison blinked at him until in swift stages the truth
  about the night before crowded upon his memory and made him sit up with a
  groan.</p>

  <p>The old man did not turn his head. "That's life for ye," he said at
  length. "A-laughing one minute and a-groaning the next. Well, well,
  well!"</p>

  <p>"How come you're here?" asked Lee, swinging his legs down from the bed and
  dropping his elbows on his knees. But his question was received with a
  counter interrogation.</p>

  <p>"Is your head a-swelling and a-busting now, maybe?" asked Billy Sidney
  tenderly, turning toward the youth.</p>

  <p>"No," said Lee.</p>

  <p>"Ain't it now?" The bushy white eyebrows went up. "Well, hornswoggle me,
  if that ain't queer! Crawford, now, he moans and curses and shows his teeth
  when he wakes up of a morning after blotting up red-eye the way you was going
  last night. But you're younger. That's it. Oh, they's a pile of gifts that
  young folks has that they don't know enough to be thankful for."</p>

  <p>"Crawford sent you over to ask me to pay up damage done to his dance floor
  when the horse pranced on it&mdash;is that why you're here, Billy?"</p>

  <p>The ancient wagged his head in melancholy dissent. "If spoiled dance
  floors was all that you owed Crawford," murmured Billy Sidney, "he's be a
  happier man than what he is this blessed morning, lad."</p>

  <p>"Then what else did he lose? I'll pay."</p>

  <p>"You'll pay? Then pay the good name that he used to have that's gone now.
  Bring back the crowds that need to go drink there and that'll never drink in
  a place of his again. No, sir, never no more will gents hunting a good time
  go to Crawford's&mdash;only them that want cheap liquor, and rotten cheap it
  is!"</p>

  <p>Upon this amazing speech Lee focused his attention in vain. He could make
  nothing of it, and he said as much to his strange visitor. Bad Luck Billy
  Sidney turned toward him at last.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you show us the rotten yaller heart of Crawford's?" he asked.
  "Didn't you take the gal back that he'd told to stay out, and didn't you take
  her on horseback? And then didn't you make him crawl like a hound?" For every
  statement his pointing hand jerked up, and his voice squeaked higher. He
  relaxed from this climax and settled back in his chair. "Yes, Garrison, you
  done all that, and more. When you left, I was plumb sick, thinking of the
  time that I'd wasted trying to drag Crawford up and make a man of him. I
  unbuttoned the flap of my holster and got my old gun loose in the leather. I
  walked up to Crawford and told him plain what I was thinking. I was sure
  particular to leave nothing out. You'd think he'd've tied me in a knot and
  throwed me through the window? No, sir, he couldn't take his eyes off of my
  old hand, wrapped around the butt of my gun, and pretty soon he wets his lips
  and looks up at me sort of scared, like a kid waiting for the teacher to hit
  him.</p>

  <p>"And that's Crawford&mdash;man-eating Crawford&mdash;that's all he
  is&mdash;yaller, yaller, yaller! I walked out of his place all holler inside
  to think that a thing like him should look so much like a man. Out in the
  air, I took a glimpse at my gun and seen that it wasn't loaded, but it
  might've been a whole cannon, Garrison, for all of Crawford. No, sir, you
  couldn't get a Chinaman to step inside of Crawford's boots today, he's that
  low."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said Lee. "I'm sure sorry for the poor devil. Did you come
  down to tell me that story?"</p>

  <p>The old man snorted. "I thank heaven," he said, "that I ain't one of them
  that has to have reasons for everything they do. Sumpthin' told me that I'd
  better slide down here early this morning. Down I come, and the lady of the
  house says that you ain't up. 'It don't make no difference,' says I. 'I'll
  wait till he wakes up.'</p>

  <p>"'Mister,' says she, 'I don't know's I know you.'</p>

  <p>"'I don't know as you do,' says I, 'and I'm sorry for you. Kindly step out
  of the way.'</p>

  <p>"Polite but turrible firm. That's me with women folk.</p>

  <p>Give 'em an inch, and they take a mile. I never give 'em that inch of a
  fingerhold to start with. Well, sir, I come in here, and what d'you think I
  see? I seen you, lying there with the sun on your face. Was it spirits that
  brought me clean the length of the town to put that chair there to keep your
  eyes shaded? I dunno, but here I been sitting ever since, watching out that
  nothing happens. I can see that you need a pile of watching, son. Did they
  break you last night before you finished?"</p>

  <p>And Lee Garrison knew that the old fellow had adopted him.</p>

  <p>"If they did," he said, "there's plenty more money to be won at
  Lefhvre's."</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said Billy. "First thing I'm going to do is to break you of
  that gambling habit, son."</p>

  <p>"You think you could cure me, Billy?"</p>

  <p>"If patience will do it," asserted Billy Sidney, "I'm the most
  outlastingest gent that ever you seen."</p>

  <p>"In the meantime," said Lee, "hadn't I better try one more whirl while I'm
  getting some coin to start on?"</p>

  <p>"Money? Money ain't nothing that counts," said the old man. He drew out a
  wallet and tossed it to Lee. "Use that," he said, "and, when it's gone,
  something else will turn up. Ever notice that nobody starves in this heaven-
  blessed world of ours?"</p>

  <p>Lee raised the worn leather wallet. "This is about all you've got in that
  same heaven-blessed world, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Ain't I just been saying that money don't count?" snapped out Billy.
  "They's five hundred in that. It ain't so much, and it ain't so little, if
  you go easy when you're spending."</p>

  <p>Lee tossed the wallet back to the old man's lap. "You've got a good heart,
  Billy," he said, "and you think you've got hold of some wild, man-killing,
  gold-eating wildcat. But I'm not, Billy. I'm none of those things."</p>

  <p>The old man gazed upon Lee with gentle eyes.</p>

  <p>"This town thinks it knows me, but it doesn't," argued Lee. "It's all a
  misunderstanding. I've won some money by blind luck, and most likely I'll
  never win another penny. I don't need anyone to ride herd on me, Billy. I'm
  not a troublemaker. Will you believe me?"</p>

  <p>"Sure I will," said Billy Sidney. "You're a lamb, you are. You're plumb
  covered with soft fleece, I guess. Yep, they all figure the same way&mdash;
  they all figure that they're flying around like doves of peace."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going to believe me?" cried Lee.</p>

  <p>"I believe every word you say, son. Sure I do. I ain't come to ride herd
  on you. Shucks, no. I'm just here to pass the time of day and keep out any
  badmen that might come in here and bother a peaceful fellow like you and get
  your nerves shook up."</p>

  <p>Lee lay back on the bed and laughed feebly. With or without his assent, he
  felt that a partnership had been formed.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; THE CHALLENGE</h2>

  <p class="first">"Tell me what they've been saying about me today," asked Lee
  with painful eagerness.</p>

  <p>Bad Luck Billy Sidney grinned. "They say you're one of them quiet gents
  that thinks every day is Sunday," he said.</p>

  <p>"Tell me the truth," pleaded Lee.</p>

  <p>"Well," admitted Billy, "I had a look at some red-eye in that new dump the
  man from Chicago is opening up."</p>

  <p>"They were talking about the fool I made of myself last night, I guess,"
  muttered Lee.</p>

  <p>"They was talking about how Crawford left town last night," chuckled the
  old man. "Out he slipped before dawn, and whipped his hosses down the valley.
  But he can't travel so fast and so far that the news of what he is won't come
  along and catch up with him, the yaller dog! Come to think of it, they was a
  little talk about you, too. I guess that surprises you, maybe?" And he winked
  at Lee.</p>

  <p>"You've got a talent for picking up the news, Billy."</p>

  <p>"It ain't a talent&mdash;it's a gift," said Billy. "I don't do nothing but
  sit still and pretty soon gents begin to tell me all about themselves. Just
  keeping still works better than asking questions."</p>

  <p>"But what were they saying?" insisted Lee impatiently.</p>

  <p>"They were saying," chuckled Billy with another wink, "that for a gent
  that don't make a business of it, you sure got a pile of luck, son. You raked
  in a lot of admiration, Garrison. And, you got Harry Chandler so worked up
  that he wants to run Laughter ag'in' Moonshine. About a thousand gents have
  been going up to Harry and saying that they thought Moonshine was a finer
  set-up hoss than Laughter, and that he'd just nacherally walk away from the
  mare, if they had a race. But Harry'll be along and talk to you about it,
  most like. He's a-ramping and a-raving. It's plumb blasphemy to him, this
  talk that any hoss in the mountains can run faster than Laughter. Would you
  bet on Moonshine ag'in' the mare?"</p>

  <p>Lee Garrison laughed and waved his hand.</p>

  <p>"She's a clean-bred one," cautioned the old man.</p>

  <p>But Lee had passed beyond thought of horses. "I saw a girl with Harry last
  night," he said.</p>

  <p>"Can you see Harry when there ain't a girl with him?" asked Billy. "Was it
  in Lefhvre's?"</p>

  <p>"It was outside. She was pale and kind of dark-eyed. And she looked sort
  of young."</p>

  <p>"That might be a dozen," observed Billy Sidney. "I never seen a camp like
  this&mdash;Gus Tree says that he ain't, either. Gents have brung along wives
  and daughters like they was going homesteading, instead of mining&mdash;
  which ain't such a bad idea, at that, to have a woman along for cooking and
  such, and leave both of a man's hands free for breaking rock. That reminds
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you have ever seen the girl I'm talking about," said Lee thoughtfully,
  "you wouldn't be saying that there're any others like her, because there
  aren't. You mind that I don't mean she's the kind that a gent would turn
  around to stare at, when she went by him in the street, but he'd wake up in
  the middle of the night and see her face as plain as though daylight was on
  it."</p>

  <p>Billy Sidney was staring at him with black disapproval, and spelled out
  the words of his answer with oracular reluctance.</p>

  <p>"Maybe the&mdash;lady&mdash;you seen," he said, with the word lady set off
  by both pause and emphasis, "maybe the lady you seen, Garrison, was McGuire's
  girl. Maybe it was Sally McGuire. She's going to marry Harry&mdash; of
  course, you know that?"</p>

  <p>Lee Garrison rose, crossed the room, and stared out the window. "They'll
  make an uncommonly fine-looking couple," he said.</p>

  <p>"They will," said the old man with equal gravity.</p>

  <p>"But why aren't there crowds around her?"</p>

  <p>"There was until Harry got mixed in, and then they seen there was no
  chance. Competition don't prosper none around Harry. He's got the looks. And
  he's a hellbender in a fight."</p>

  <p>"Him!" exclaimed Lee. "He looks more like a four-o'clock tea."</p>

  <p>"Sure he does. But the reason I been telling you all this, Garrison, is
  because I knowed he was coming, and I want to warn you. Please don't make no
  slips when you're chinning with Harry. And he ain't fifty steps down the
  street right now."</p>

  <p>He was even closer. The words were hardly out of Billy's mouth, when big
  Harry Chandler stood at the open door and nodded a greeting to them.</p>

  <p>"If Billy is here," said Harry, "you know the talk that's going around the
  town, Garrison. They've gone wild over Moonshine. I've had a steady string of
  men dropping in to bet me that the stallion can beat my mare. They've worn me
  out, as a matter of fact, so I've come over to see what you think of a
  race."</p>

  <p>"I've never seen the mare," said Lee.</p>

  <p>Chandler lighted a cigarette and studied Lee for a moment through a veil
  of smoke before he answered. "Suppose we take a look at her, then?"</p>

  <p>So they crossed the street. Behind the line of houses, in a box stall far
  more solidly and spaciously built than most of the houses in Crooked Creek,
  they looked in at Laughter. She was one of those glossy, night-dark browns
  which a sheen of perspiration turns into glistening black. She came to meet
  them with pricking ears and nibbled mischievously at the hand that Chandler
  held out to her.</p>

  <p>It was a beautiful head, wide across the brow, bony, small-muzzled, and
  with great dark eyes like the eyes of a deer. Lee Garrison looked on her with
  delight, then stepped behind the stall with the others. Viewed from the side,
  she was a new chapter in his knowledge of horses. Long-barreled, thin of
  belly, she had what seemed to Lee an awkward length of leg. For the
  quick-dodging, twisting work of a roundup she would be worse than useless.
  How she could carry the weight of Harry through a single day was a
  mystery.</p>

  <p>But there was a reason. Along the sloping shoulders and down the thigh to
  the hock she was muscled like a greyhound. There was ample bone, too, and
  plenty of girth where the forward cinch runs, and where size means lung
  power. Yes, she had strength to spare to drive those spindling legs, but
  every ounce of her muscle was placed at the point of greatest need.</p>

  <p>"If a man was to ask me," said Billy Sidney, "I'd say that her and
  Moonshine ain't made for the same sort of running. Give her a nice stretch of
  flat land and not too far to go, and you couldn't catch her, if you had a
  saddle on the wind. But over tough going through the hills Moonshine would
  break her heart in half an hour. That's my idea."</p>

  <p>"No one has asked you for your idea!" said Chandler with violence. "I
  followed Moonshine for three days on this horse and couldn't lay a rope on
  him&mdash;he made a fool of us."</p>

  <p>"Because Moonshine was carrying nothing but his skin, and Laughter had a
  couple of hundred pounds on her back," mused Lee.</p>

  <p>"I understand," said Chandler, leading the way out of the stall. "Your
  horse is for show purposes, Garrison, not for use."</p>

  <p>Lee winced, for half a dozen men had gathered about them, and others were
  coming in the distance. To deny Moonshine before the world would be almost
  like denying his God.</p>

  <p>"You've got a sprinter," he said, "and I've got a long-distance horse. If
  we could fix up a race that would be fair to both of 'em&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Why," said Harry smoothly, "occasionally stakes are run up to distances
  as high as two miles and a quarter. What about a two-mile race,
  Garrison?"</p>

  <p>But Lee shook his head. "If it were ten&mdash;," he began.</p>

  <p>"I've been speaking of a race," broke in Chandler, "not a day's march.
  Suppose we compromise and make it three miles. That is surely enough for any
  horse."</p>

  <p>"That's quite a ways," said someone in the gathering crowd, and there was
  a murmur of assent.</p>

  <p>"Moonshine would clean her up in two miles, even," said another. "Ain't
  you got any faith in your hoss, Garrison?"</p>

  <p>"He doesn't like the idea of a race," said Chandler to the crowd.</p>

  <p>"Make it four miles," said Lee.</p>

  <p>"Ah," exclaimed Harry, "he'll run his horse against Laughter at four
  miles! Garrison, I accept. We try them out this afternoon in Sheep
  Valley."</p>

  <p>And he held out his hand. Instinctively Lee took it, although the warning
  voice of Bad Luck Billy cried: "Sheep Valley is as level as the palm of your
  hand. Not there, Garrison!"</p>

  <p>"He's shaken hands on it," said Chandler, grinning. "The bargain is made,
  Billy. Go croak in another place."</p>

  <p>And Lee, with despair, turned toward Laughter, where she stood at the door
  of her stall, watching them with bright eyes. He had been trapped.</p>

  <p>"As for the bet to bind the bargain," went on Harry, lighting another
  cigarette, "name anything you wish. I'll try to cover it&mdash;anything up
  herself."</p>

  <p>"Whatever you want," said Lee wretchedly.</p>

  <p>"Moonshine against Laughter, then&mdash;the winner takes the other horse.
  Shake again on that, Garrison."</p>

  <p>There was a stir of excitement in the crowd as it thickened. But Lee
  stepped back.</p>

  <p>"Risk the horse on the race? Good heaven, no!"</p>

  <p>"I thought the sky was the limit," said Harry to the spectators. "But, of
  course, a horse race is not run in Lefhvre's."</p>

  <p>There was a subdued chuckle. And it maddened Lee. That imp of the perverse
  that makes us torture the very things we love had him by the throat.</p>

  <p>"Moonshine against Laughter, then!" he cried hoarsely. "And there's my
  hand on it, Chandler."</p>

  <p>There was no chance to retract. He looked down in sick horror at the
  strong fingers of Chandler, clasping his hand.</p>

  <p>How he broke through the crowd and regained his room, he never could tell
  afterward. But there he threw himself downward on the bunk, covering his eyes
  with darkness. Like a vain child, he had thrown Moonshine away because he
  dreaded the scorn of a crowd.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; THE MESSAGE</h2>

  <p class="first">For a long hour he lay there, seeing always that vision of
  Laughter galloping ahead. When he stood up, Bad Luck Billy Sidney was again
  sitting in the sun, whittling at the stick&mdash;an endless task, for he
  struck off shavings so thin that the sun gleamed through them as they fell.
  So deep was the thought of Billy that he did not lift his head as Lee left
  the room and went out to the corral.</p>

  <p>He found it, as usual, with a group of onlookers ranged along the fences.
  But on this occasion they were not standing in the customary silence,
  dreaming over the horse. Instead, they talked eagerly, with many gestures.
  From the distance more men were coming in businesslike haste. The first words
  he heard left no doubt as to the nature of these spectators. Every man there
  had placed a bet with Harry on the result of the race between Moonshine and
  Laughter. The news of the duel was spreading as fast as Harry could travel
  through Crooked Creek, laying his wagers.</p>

  <p>"Five hundred of coin I've sweated for," said one, "is on your back, you
  gray devil."</p>

  <p>"I spent two thousand cold trying to catch you, beauty," said another.
  "Run for me today and win it back!"</p>

  <p>A sallow-faced man, smoking a cigar, came with a notebook in his hand,
  recording bets. He was making a drive on Laughter, and from the fence he
  looked over the gray and the gray's owner.</p>

  <p>"Tolerable good news you got there, son," he said. "Certainly looks like
  he could stand up all day. Laying any money?"</p>

  <p>"He's betting the hoss," answered the crowd in an admiring murmur. "He's
  betting Moonshine on the race!"</p>

  <p>The backer of Laughter removed his cigar. "Well, sir," he said, "that's
  what I call sporting. I'm Henry Dexter, sir." They shook hands. "You got to
  pardon me, if my money and my heart goes with the clean-bred ones, Mister
  Garrison. Laughter is a lovely mare, sir, and she carries my coin. But good
  fortune to you. If your hoss has as much courage as you have, sir, he'll give
  the mare a race."</p>

  <p>But Lee heard him through a mist. There was only one daylight reality, and
  that was the beauty of Moonshine. Moonshine, who would wear the saddle of
  another man tomorrow, and learn in time to raise his head and prick his ears,
  when Harry Chandler spoke.</p>

  <p>He went back to the street, and there he met McLeod, swinging along with
  one hand dropped in his coat pocket and the other spinning a cane. He hurried
  to Lee.</p>

  <p>"i can't say that you're wasted in your present profession," he said, "but
  you might be in advertising, Garrison. You put them asleep at night with your
  name on every lip, and you waken them in the morning with the same sound.
  What's this about the race&mdash;about Moonshine and Laughter?"</p>

  <p>Lee studied the rascal with peculiar interest. That which is wholly evil
  is often wholly delightful, and in the tumult of dread and wretched
  expectation that possessed him it was pleasant to be distracted, even by
  McLeod.</p>

  <p>"A four-mile race?" went on McLeod. "But Laughter is a lightning flash,
  Garrison. She blows over the ground like a black leaf in the wind. She&mdash;
  why, with training she would be close to a stake horse, Henry Dexter says.
  And he ought to know. Is it true that you've bet? Have you really gone
  deep?"</p>

  <p>"I've bet Moonshine to win," answered Lee. And he half wished that he
  could lead the doctor to plunge the same on the lost cause.</p>

  <p>"Moonshine to win! That's betting. What's the scheme, Garrison? Well, I've
  half a mind to follow your lead&mdash;but Laughter is a witch."</p>

  <p>"Is Charlie better?" asked Lee.</p>

  <p>"Turning the subject, eh?" chuckled McLeod. "But I don't mind. No, Charlie
  is on his last legs. Guttorm began to see through the fog I've drawn around
  him. This morning, Charlie had a hemorrhage, and Guttorm ran all the way to
  the far end of town, dragged Doc Larramee out of bed, and made Larramee run
  all the way back with him. Larramee is a hardy scoundrel. No more care for a
  man's feelings than for a piece of stone. He spent thirty seconds looking at
  Charlie. I was sitting in the next room, waiting, and I timed him. Then he
  came out.</p>

  <p>"'What can be done?' says poor Guttorm. 'It's only a little setback? He's
  coming through all right?'</p>

  <p>"'He'll die before two days,' says Larramee.</p>

  <p>"Guttorm let out a cross between a moan and a howl. Then he looked to me.
  He'd made up his mind, when the hemorrhage came, that I was no good. The
  minute he heard the truth, he turned back to me.</p>

  <p>"'It ain't true, Doc?' he says to me.</p>

  <p>"'Certainly not,' I said.</p>

  <p>"'You scoundrel!' bellows Guttorm at Larramee. 'Get out!'</p>

  <p>"Larramee is a big man. But Guttorm picked him up by the neck and the seat
  of the trousers, the way big boys pick up little boys to throw them into the
  swimming pool. Guttorm threw Larramee through the door in exactly that
  manner. The doctor hit the ground, splashed a few curses around, and then got
  up, and swore he'd come back with a gun. Guttorm didn't hear. He was back in
  Charlie's room, stroking the brat's forehead.</p>

  <p>"'Take your hand away,' says Charlie, 'it's rough.'</p>

  <p>"Guttorm came out into the next room with me.</p>

  <p>They'd brought him a couple of pounds of the first gold out of the new
  strike he made. He grabbed the bag out of his pocket and dropped it into
  mine.</p>

  <p>"'You're going to stick by us, Doc, ain't you?' he said. 'You wouldn't
  leave me now, just because I flew off the handle, and.&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'I'll be with you as long as I can do the slightest good for you,
  Guttorm,' I said. And he followed me all the way to the street, thanking me
  with tears in his eyes. By birth and education, Garrison, that Scandinavian
  is a fool. But to come back to this race. I understand it's at five this
  afternoon. Shall I back Moonshine?"</p>

  <p>"As you please," said Lee quietly.</p>

  <p>"Will anyone else in town bet on your horse, though, against a flash like
  Laughter?"</p>

  <p>"Everyone who ever tried to run Moonshine down with a string of horses,
  and there seem to be plenty of them here."</p>

  <p>McLeod paused, spun his cane while he frowned at the ground, and then with
  a curt farewell was off down the street. Whatever his plans were, he was in
  haste to put them into execution. Lee looked after him with profound envy. If
  conscience is man's most mortal disease, the doctor was immune to the
  plague.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>A rider halted beside him with the dust spurting under the feet of his
  horse. "You're Lee Garrison, ain't you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Miss McGuire wants to know, can she see you?"</p>

  <p>He had felt that there was nothing in the world that would make him forget
  Moonshine and his melancholy, but this name in an instant brushed the clouds
  from the sky and let the kind sunshine fall upon him.</p>

  <p>"Sally McGuire? She wants to see me?"</p>

  <p>"She does. I dunno&mdash;" The messenger clamped his teeth on the rest of
  the sentence and twitched his cow pony around.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, partner. Where's she now?"</p>

  <p>"the brown tent to your left, just outside of town."</p>

  <p>Scratching for the start, the cow pony cast up a great fog of dust, and
  then drew away at a rapid gallop, while Lee headed for the store. There he
  purchased a shirt of blue China silk and a new scarlet bandanna, which, when
  the knot was turned under his chin, left a tip that flowed halfway down his
  back.</p>

  <p>These touches, he felt, made him presentable, but he stepped hastily into
  the street with an uncomfortable impression that he had kept her waiting
  long&mdash;far too long. He looked up at a sound of merriment, and in the
  upper story of the hotel, crowded into the narrow frame of a window, he saw
  Alice and another girl.</p>

  <p>When he paused, their laughter pealed again. No doubt she was rehearsing
  the story of how she had trimmed him. But the mockery could not harm him now.
  He stared up to her with an impersonal interest. Merciful shadows of evening
  and cunning art of makeup, how terribly they were needed now. But it seemed
  to Lee that he was seeing her not so much in the glare of the morning as in
  the light of Sally McGuire.</p>

  <p>He raised his sombrero to them&mdash;an act that strangely silenced their
  mirth&mdash;and walked on.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; THE PROMISE</h2>

  <p class="first">It was the most sumptuous and house-like tent that Lee had
  ever seen. The furled sides exposed an interior so luxurious that he felt it
  was worthy of being put under glass. Even the ditch that had been trenched
  around the outside of the tent was set off with borders of little white
  stones, all of a size. Lee was filled with awe.</p>

  <p>A sound of hammering led him around to the side of the tent. There he saw
  Sally McGuire, driving a tent peg in deeper with a mallet. She swung it with
  wonderful grace, he thought. The wind curled the khaki dress about her, and
  there was a supple play in that lithe body from the waist to the strong,
  small wrists. It was a matter of secondary consideration that the mallet
  twisted awry in her hands and landed first on one side of the peg and then on
  the other, loosening it far more rapidly than it was driven into the
  earth.</p>

  <p>"If you'd let me help&mdash;," began Lee.</p>

  <p>She whirled on him, red of face. The vibrations of the pounding had shaken
  her hair loose, so that a strand of it coiled halfway down her cheek, and
  other strands were plastered to her forehead with perspiration. The wide felt
  hat that protected her from the sun sat crookedly upon her head. And even the
  red tie that girt the collar of her blouse was shifted far to the side.
  Smiles, to be sure, will redeem much, but the vexation that a pretty girl
  feels when fate exposes her in disarray left Sally McGuire in what can only
  be described as a staring rage. Such a mood as causes children to break their
  toys now made Sally McGuire fling the mallet upon the ground.</p>

  <p>And Lee was utterly bewildered. How could he recognize the pale-faced
  beauty of the evening before? But if an illusion of mystery were lost, who
  will not exchange the unapproachable beauty of a dream for daylight flesh and
  blood not altogether different from other girls? A few swift ministrations of
  her fingers and the stray threads of hair were tucked away, the hat and
  necktie righted. A great effort conjured the smile of polite greeting to her
  lips, but her eyes remained dark&mdash;there was a stinging blister raised by
  that infernal mallet on her right hand.</p>

  <p>"You sent for me." said Lee.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered. "Thank you for coming. And if you don't put your hat
  on, you'll get sunstroke."</p>

  <p>He placed it on his head in haste. Of a surety this was not the sad-eyed
  girl of the night before. He was led inside the tent and a folding stool
  pointed out. There he sat with his hat in his hands between his knees,
  desperately conscious that his hair was blown on end and wagging in the
  breeze. She sat just opposite, her hands dropped in her lap, her eyes
  inescapably direct. Lee recognized the awe that spread over him. Many a time
  in his childhood he had felt it, when the schoolteacher turned on him, and he
  had chilly foreknowledge that he was about to be called on for an answer he
  did not know. Girls did not wear guns, decided Lee, because they did not need
  them.</p>

  <p>"It's about the horse race," she said, "your Moonshine against Laughter."
  She paused, drew a little breath, and went on. "I understand that Laughter
  ought to win, but that there is a chance that she may fail." It began to dawn
  on Lee that her crispness was an unnatural manner, and that she was badly
  frightened. "In fact, I understand you're so sure of winning that you've bet
  your horse."</p>

  <p>"I made that bet&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>"Very good," she said. "Now, the point is, Mister Garrison, that for lots
  and lots of reasons Moonshine mustn't win, and I'll pay to see that he
  loses."</p>

  <p>She drew out a checkbook and a pen. "How much does this race mean to you,
  Mister Garrison? Why I have courage to talk so frankly is simply because I
  understand that you make a business out of&mdash;chance, you know."</p>

  <p>"They've told you I'm a gambler?"</p>

  <p>"I know," she said with a faint smile. "You have to deny it, as a rule.
  But here is a time when you need not pretend. Not the least bit. I just want
  to finish this as quickly as I can. So tell me frankly, Mister Garrison, how
  much does this race mean to you in dollars and cents? Count in the price of
  the horse and all your bets&mdash;I won't argue about the amount as long as
  it's in reason."</p>

  <p>With how neat an accuracy she laid the last of her contempt upon him. He
  was a gambler&mdash;therefore, his very soul was for sale.</p>

  <p>"Other men are betting on my horse," he said.</p>

  <p>"Other men can take their own chances. Besides, I'd pay back what they
  lose."</p>

  <p>"You're doing this for Mister Chandler?"</p>

  <p>"I'm asking you to name the amount, Mister Garrison." It was consummate
  torture to sit so close to her contempt. But did she realize the full
  baseness of the thing she was asking him to do?</p>

  <p>"If Moonshine is winning," he said, "you want me to pull him up and cheat
  the men who risked their money on him and me? And cheat Moonshine, too, when
  he's fighting to win?"</p>

  <p>She fired up at that. "But if Laughter is beaten, the man who owns her
  will be beaten, too. And one more blow will break him&mdash;oh&mdash;I know
  it. He isn't made to struggle for money. One more blow will finish him. What
  do I care for small points of honor? I'm fighting to save the soul of a man,
  and I'll do it."</p>

  <p>He could not help but remember those far-off days, when he had struggled
  down the trail, footsore, heartsick, and had seen the beauty of Moonshine on
  a hilltop above and beyond him. "Do you know how I got my horse?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I walked a thousand miles through the mountains, across five states."</p>

  <p>"You walked?" she cried, amazed.</p>

  <p>"I was sitting in a dugout down in the Staked Plains, reading Malory. Do
  you know that book?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes were parted with her wonder as she nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, into my dugout came a man that might have stepped right out of that
  book, except he was an American Indian. And he'd worn himself to death on the
  trail of a horse just the way the knights had once died for the Grail. I
  listened to him raving about Moonshine. I saw him die. And when I buried
  him&mdash;there was Moonshine, cutting across the hills, looking like he was
  made out of light. Oh, but he was glorious!"</p>

  <p>He stopped as that picture burned home in his mind. "I started after him
  the way I was&mdash;on foot. I kept walking till my feet were cut to pieces.
  I trailed him up into the mountains where I nearly froze. I trailed him down
  to the lava where I nearly died of thirst. I crossed the Colorado. I kept on
  going till my ammunition was gone. And, after it was gone, I lived on the
  sage hens and the grouse I could knock over with sticks and stones. I got
  thin and shriveled up with starving and no sleep. My hand was like the hand
  of an old man. But always Moonshine was galloping away ahead of me like there
  were wings on his feet. It seemed to me, if I could catch him, I'd die
  happy.</p>

  <p>"And sometimes I got into a rage. I wanted to ride him to death. I wanted
  to make him know that he had a master. And always he was getting thinner and
  weaker, until finally I managed to rope him.</p>

  <p>"He was too weak to buck me off, when I let him up. But off in the hills
  he heard a waterfall hollering like a hundred men, and the noise blowing away
  to a whisper and coming back with a shout. He couldn't get me off any other
  way, so he ran for that waterfall to kill himself&mdash;to stay free! I saw
  what he was aiming at, but I stayed on. It seemed to me it was better to die
  fighting for him than to give up. We jumped off the cliff together and landed
  in the water beneath. I wasn't hurt, but one of his hoofs was torn loose, and
  he was stunned.</p>

  <p>"Well, I dragged him on shore, dammed the water away, and tied up the hoof
  with mud and bark. There I stayed week after week, waiting for the hoof to
  get well, wondering if it would heal so he could walk on it, and all the time
  getting thicker and thicker with that horse. I pulled up grass to feed him. I
  built a shelter for him. And all those weeks I was happy. He got so he could
  hobble around on three feet, with the bad foot held up in a sling to keep it
  from hitting the ground, and him that I'd hated and trailed that thousand
  miles&mdash;he'd come to me, when I whistled&mdash;he'd come to me when I
  called."</p>

  <p>He threw back his head with his eyes closed, trembling with the joy of
  that great time.</p>

  <p>"He'd eat from my hand. He'd lie down at my feet. He'd follow me like a
  friend. Then the great day came. I took the sling off and let his foot touch
  the ground. Would he be able to walk, or was he lame for life? I couldn't
  bear to look to see. I closed my eyes."</p>

  <p>Lee shuddered with the horror of it. "Then I heard him begin to trot away,
  and he was hobbling just on three feet. He was ruined forever, I thought, and
  it made me sick. I'm not a praying man, but I lifted up my head with my eyes
  still shut and begged God to help him. And a minute later I heard Moonshine
  galloping&mdash;galloping with all four hoofs striking the ground, and I knew
  I'd won&mdash;I knew I'd won.</p>

  <p>"We started on, with me on his back. His strength and his speed came back.
  He was like a king, but, when I spoke to him, he went slow or fast as I told
  him, and, when I touched his neck, he'd turn. Then, one day, we came on a
  wild herd, and Moonshine went mad at the sight of them. And it seemed to me
  it was better to lose him forever, if he wanted to go, than to keep him with
  me when half of his heart all the rest of his life would be aching to be off
  running with the band he'd been king of. So I got off him. I told him to go.
  And he went like the wind."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, no," breathed the girl.</p>

  <p>"But he came back!" cried lee, throwing out his hands in exultation. "He
  came back to me, and, when Moonshine found I wouldn't go with him, he went on
  with me."</p>

  <p>He called himself back from the story. He saw her face again, and there
  were great tears in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You see," he said gently, "that's why it's hard to give him up. I simply
  couldn't give him up."</p>

  <p>"Oh," she said, "what a beautiful story. I didn't know&mdash;how could I
  dream&mdash;?" She bit her lip, as though one part of her sentence would be
  better unspoken. She dropped her face in her hands, lost in thought. "But,
  after all," she said, when she looked up, "you'll only lose Moonshine for a
  few days. There is no reason why I should keep the secret. I am to marry
  Harry Chandler, and, after we are married, I can persuade him to give back
  your horse. It's only a question of telling him the story you have told
  me."</p>

  <p>Lee shook his head. "Nobody could give up Moonshine," he said.</p>

  <p>"But I promise! Oh, Harry is the soul of generosity and honor. That's the
  very thing that has spoiled all his chances. There's no germ of the
  money-maker in him, and he's sworn he will not marry me until he can support
  me without my fortune. But money is nothing to me. My father has made ten
  fortunes and piled them one on another. My mother made me rich in my own
  name. It means nothing to give you whatever the loss of this race may be
  worth to you. But, while it means nothing to me, it is everything to Harry.
  Today he's taking his last chance. If he fails&mdash;he'll ride out of my
  life and into some wild adventure&mdash;I know&mdash;I know!"</p>

  <p>There was no more storm and defiance. She had clasped her hands together
  in entreaty, and Lee could no longer resist that tugging at his heartstrings.
  He stood up.</p>

  <p>"Then Moonshine will lose," he said. "I'll give my word."</p>

  <p>"God bless you!" cried Sally McGuire. "And now the money&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I'll manage that, some way. But I can't take charity, you see."</p>

  <p>She blocked his escape. "Mister Garrison! What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"What I've given my word I'll do."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Will you do one favor for me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes&mdash;and the check will be whatever.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will you try on this glove?"</p>

  <p>He drew out the old, tattered glove he had carried so far, and she,
  bewildered, slipped her hand into it. It fitted to a minute perfection, and,
  just as he had imagined, the rosy tip of a finger projected through the torn
  end.</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?" asked Sally McGuire, as she stripped it off and
  returned it to him.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Lee that emotion would choke him. Fate, then, must have taken
  a hand and guided him from the shanty among the mountains to the girl who had
  lived in it.</p>

  <p>"It means nothing," stammered Lee, and took advantage of her wonder to
  slip past her, through the doorway, and into the night.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash; SHEEP VALLEY</h2>

  <p class="first">The uproar from the mines was ending as he left, token that
  Crooked Creek was already leaving the mines to gather for the race. The
  sunshine was neither bright nor warm as he went down the street again, and he
  noted the increased length of the shadows that meant the time for his parting
  with Moonshine was not far off. He turned to glance back at the tent, but
  Sally McGuire was not standing at the entrance to call him back and restore
  his promise. Instead, his eyes glanced upward to that mountain capped with
  white rock now thrusting so high into the tender blue of heaven. A curse had
  fallen upon him from that landmark toward which so many others were hurrying,
  even now, as the goal of hope.</p>

  <p>He shut himself up in his room for an hour. Even Billy Sidney could not
  come. It was not until the time for the race was close at hand that he went
  out again. He found a crowd around the corral. Little Gus Tree stepped out to
  meet him.</p>

  <p>"Well," he chuckled, "I see that you ain't on your way for the mines yet?
  You ain't started with a drill and a single-jack, son?" Coming a bit closer,
  he jerked his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of Moonshine. "Shall I
  get money down on him, son? Don't seem to me like he has the legs to stand
  off that Laughter here. But I ain't a hoss-flesh expert. You tell me what to
  think, will you, Garrison, and I'll do my talking in hard cash."</p>

  <p>"You may be rich," said Lee bitterly, "but you'd have to be terribly rich
  to afford to bet on Moonshine."</p>

  <p>"Unless the weight of Harry breaks Laughter down?"</p>

  <p>"That won't happen, I guess."</p>

  <p>"Then why the devil are you racing against&mdash;?" The barber stepped
  away, shaking his head solemnly. "I dunno how you figure this, Garrison.
  You're certainly deep."</p>

  <p>Lee pressed past him until he heard the voice of Billy Sidney and saw that
  ancient worthy in an attitude of commanding importance.</p>

  <p>"No other hoss in the world," Billy was saying, "would've lived through
  the busting that this hoss took. But they's only one Moonshine. Put your
  money where you please, boys, but, when Garrison finished betting Moonshine
  against Laughter, he turns around to me and says&mdash;'Billy, was there
  anything easier than that, ever? But it's a shame to take his mare away
  from&mdash;here he is now&mdash;Lee!"</p>

  <p>The unblushing old liar turned with a smile and a wave toward his new-
  found patron.</p>

  <p>Lee Garrison saddled by a mechanical effort and led Moonshine out through
  the gate and swung onto his back. After that the crowd that had started for
  Sheep Valley carried them along. Passing the hotel, Lee looked up and saw
  Alice at the window with the sun on her face. She pointed to herself and then
  back to him, and at last brandished a handful of greenbacks&mdash;sign
  language to say she had weighed heavily on his good fortune. Then she hung
  out the window, kissing her hand to him.</p>

  <p>How could she smile on him today, he wondered vaguely, when last night was
  such a short distance behind them? But she and the yellowing sunshine and the
  faces it glinted upon and the rolling of voices were dreamy things that he
  saw as a child sees when it is tired. So he and his followers came out below
  the town and into the open where the hills pushed back. To the right Crooked
  Creek hummed and talked to one side and twisted its muddy waters down the
  slope. But the drift of people&mdash;and everyone from the mines had gathered
  before them or was hastening now from the rear&mdash;set in toward a flat
  tableland of sandy ground, the partially filled floor of the valley from
  which the river had disappeared long centuries before. But it wound back now
  as a river valley will, the white sand turning to brown and to blue in the
  distance where the valley disappeared. The populace of Crooked Creek had
  bunched at the mouth of the plain in the greater part, for the start and the
  finish could be best seen from there.</p>

  <p>But others, willing to miss the two most exciting instants for the sake of
  seeing a greater portion of the race from a good angle, had spread thin lines
  that, with many a gap, roughly stretched the four-mile loop of the course,
  and their forms dwindled in the distance, at the far end more obscured by a
  haze of dust a wind of gathering force blew up the valley.</p>

  <p>So much Lee saw before his attention focused on Laughter. She was full
  sixteen-three, and the more exaggerated in apparent height by the size of the
  boy in the saddle. There was no need of Chandler, standing at the head of the
  brown mare, to identify it. There could not be two of that kind. This was the
  invincible Laughter, and what a heart-stopping beauty as she danced and
  tossed her head, played with the bit, shrank back and winced to the side, and
  then pawed a cloud of dust into the air, jerking her nervous head about to
  watch the dust whipped into nothingness by the wind.</p>

  <p>No wonder Harry had wagered his last dollar on her, for she was framed and
  molded to one thing only&mdash;speed. She pranced about and faced Lee. It was
  a knife-edge that she presented to the wind of her gallop. There was lung
  space enough where the girths ran, but her chest was not so broad as to
  interfere with the long, elastic sweep of the shoulders. Her neck was
  straight as a string, and her head on the eye of it was snaky thin. How
  different from the haughty and arched crest of the stallion. Now Harry loosed
  her head and off she went, going out into a long, rolling gallop. Lee
  Garrison watched her shoot past the watchers.</p>

  <p>They gave her an excited shout of admiration as her diminutive rider
  brought her up and turned her back&mdash;she was clumsy and sprawling in that
  turn, Lee thought. Then he saw the face of the boy who was exercising
  her.</p>

  <p>It was Buddy Slocum.</p>

  <p>Those who had gathered in wait saw the gray champion coming, and they
  raised a cheer that showed in a thrice where their hearts lay. The horse they
  valued truly was one they knew could answer the test of the desert and
  mountain and fierce labor day by day under a withering sun that would kill
  Laughter between sunrise and sunset. There were cowpunchers, also, who might
  gasp in admiration at the enormous bounds of the mare, but who, thinking of
  the short stops, the twists and turnings of the roundup, the foot-handiness a
  horse must have to be worth his salt, shook their heads when they saw the
  tall black sprawling as she turned. For them, and for all who had ridden the
  grisly trail from sea-level desert to timber-line snow, Moonshine was the
  horse. A full hand shorter than Laughter, he had twice her strength in his
  sturdy quarters and in the rubbery cords of muscle that slipped and bunched
  along his shoulders. That gaunt belly of hers would tuck up to famine
  leanness in a day or two, and the greyhound back would buckle under a
  crushing burden, whereas Moonshine with a fine long line below that promised
  speed enough had the shortness above that meant strength. He would gallop all
  day with a quarter of a thousand pounds.</p>

  <p>The confidence of the stallion's supporters grew. They shouted
  affectionate encouragement to him. A reckless miner ventured too close, and
  the heels of the stallion flashed and hit the hand the man threw up to shield
  his face. He fell flat on his back and rolled to safety in a roar of
  applause. In the eyes of that crowd, Moonshine could do no harm. They blamed
  him no more than they would have blamed a captive eagle. No matter where
  their money lay, he was champion of their heart of hearts.</p>

  <p>"Start the race," said old Billy Sidney feverishly. "It's ten minutes to
  five already, and Moonshine is running a mile every minute you wait."</p>

  <p>Behind the fence of the corral Moonshine had endured the nearness of men
  well enough, for that fence was a symbol that none could approach him, saving
  the master. But here in the open there could be seen nothing between him and
  their hands, which moved with fire, and their mouths, which puffed forth
  smoke like the nostrils of a hungry bear on a frosty morning. Moreover, their
  nearness made his heart go out suddenly to the freedom of the wide sands
  before him. As Lee swung down to the ground, he crowded closer against the
  back of the master, keeping his head high, with his upper lip thrust out
  stiffly, and his frightened eyes glittering. He shrank and trembled at the
  raising of every hand, the sound of every voice. Compared with this horror of
  men that set the gray dripping with perspiration, the nervous eagerness of
  the mare was statuesque calm.</p>

  <p>Lee turned from a glance at his horse to Harry Chandler. Between the
  moment the bet was laid and five o'clock, Harry had spent the equivalent of
  two sleepless nights. He had the same battered look, and the eyes he lowered
  toward his cigarette were circled with purple.</p>

  <p>"With Slocum in the saddle," said someone, "Laughter looks good enough to
  beat the wind, but she'll size up a lot different when you fit into the
  stirrups, Chandler. That's what we're counting on."</p>

  <p>"You are?" asked Harry, and, glancing around the circle at the nodding
  heads, he exclaimed with a vicious pleasure: "Who said that the owners were
  to ride? Was that laid down in the conditions? No! Buddy Slocum rides
  Laughter today."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; THE RACE</h2>

  <p class="first">Never did orator, pausing in declamation to receive
  applause, fall into an attitude more carefully studied than that of the
  ex-jockey. Before the surprising announcement of Harry had brought attention
  to quick focus on his champion, little Buddy Slocum had stiffened in the
  saddle, and now he sat with his arms folded and his chin high and the long
  visor of his hat shadowing his face down to the joyous grin. Thousands of
  dollars had been wagered on Moonshine. Now in a breath, hope was snatched
  from the backers of the stallion. The excitement that had frothed and bubbled
  in Crooked Creek for half a day expired in a murmured groan from half the
  crowd and a buzz of contented comment from the rest. Tricks were not popular,
  nevertheless, and this underhand maneuver brought solemn glances in the
  direction of Harry.</p>

  <p>As for Lee Garrison, the sight of Slocum in the saddle meant that there
  would be excuse for the defeat of Moonshine. The honor of the stallion would
  be saved. But, oh, to mate this treacherous move on the part of Harry
  Chandler by a mighty effort of his own&mdash;by a ride that would fairly lift
  the gray horse over the ground! Yet his hands were chained.</p>

  <p>There was now a frantic clamor from those who had bet on Moonshine and now
  wished to change and cover their money. In ten seconds there were odds of
  three to one being freely offered on Laughter, and no Moonshine money in
  sight. The whole crowd was in a hubbub. Harry Chandler defended himself as
  well as he could.</p>

  <p>"There are plenty of other lightweights," he said. "I don't care who put
  you up, Garrison, damned if I do! There's Charlie Morton's kid. He doesn't
  weigh over a hundred and twenty pounds, if he's an ounce. Get him!"</p>

  <p>There was no need for Lee to answer. A dozen stern voices told Harry what
  he must already know&mdash;that Lee Garrison was the only man whose life was
  worth a penny on the back of the mustang. That murmur brought dark blood into
  the cheeks of Chandler. He had lived so long in the public eye and with
  public applause that this sound was poison in his ear, and his impulsive
  start told Lee that the big man was on the verge of taking the saddle
  himself. But he checked that impulse. There was too much at stake.</p>

  <p>"All right," called Billy Sidney, "if everything's settled, let's start
  the race. Moonshine is fair wearing himself out. He ain't used to crowds like
  this, Chandler."</p>

  <p>Harry looked again at the sweat-darkened body of the gray and set his jaw.
  He slipped his watch into his open palm.</p>

  <p>"The race was set for five o'clock," he announced, "and it'll be run off
  at that time&mdash;no sooner! If your horse can't stand a crowd, you should
  have kept him away from it."</p>

  <p>It was such bad sportsmanship that the men kept quiet in wonder. There was
  only one sharp, faint exclamation, and Chandler turned to confront Sally
  McGuire. The women of Crooked Creek had come in their gayest finery, flower-
  like in the crowd of miners. How and why they should have brought such
  clothes into the mountains, no one saving another woman could tell.</p>

  <p>Sally McGuire was as drab as any breaker of rock in her short skirt and
  mannish blouse, but the colors of flowers, indeed, were in her face.</p>

  <p>"Shame!" she had cried. "Shame!"</p>

  <p>"It's the rules of the race!" exclaimed Harry. "Besides, why shouldn't I
  take advantage, if I can? There's too much up on this race. Good heavens,
  Sally, you know what&mdash;" He checked himself, for she was looking at him
  in startled amazement.</p>

  <p>She's true blue, breathed Lee to himself. She's as square as they come.
  And maybe&mdash;pray to heaven&mdash;she'll learn to look through Harry
  today. Maybe this race'll show her. Can't anybody see what he is? Just a
  spoiled kid grown into a man.</p>

  <p>Harry Chandler deliberately turned his back on her, bracing his feet wide
  apart as though prepared to go counter to the opinion of the entire world. It
  was not a pretty exhibition, and old Gus Tree, removing his hat and polishing
  his bald head with a purple silk handkerchief, communicated that fact to
  Harry with his accustomed bluntness.</p>

  <p>"I've bet on your hoss, Chandler," he said, "but it sure won't give me no
  satisfaction, if I win."</p>

  <p>Harry glowered in the direction of the speaker, but, before he could
  directly answer, Gus was calling to men whom he spotted in the crowd: "Hey,
  Jerry, bets off if you want!"</p>

  <p>"I sure do, Gus. I wasn't figuring on anything like this."</p>

  <p>"Hello, Joe&mdash;we'll call our bet quits, too."</p>

  <p>That fearless denunciation brought up the silenced chorus, and the others
  began to say what they thought, although it was by no means all of a piece
  with the speech of Gus Tree. There was too much money wagered on the black
  mare, and, although a few imitated the generous example of the barber, the
  greater majority were loud on defense of the bets they had laid.</p>

  <p>It was then that Lee called Billy Sidney to him. "Start betting in my
  name," he said. "They'll take your bets. Keep going until you've got down
  fifteen thousand on Moonshine."</p>

  <p>"Are you plumb crazy?" groaned poor Billy.</p>

  <p>"Do what I tell you. I have a reason!" And a good reason it was, for, when
  Moonshine was beaten, he was resolved that his wallet should be empty.</p>

  <p>Across the trembling withers of the stallion Lee found Sally McGuire
  watching him with wonder, with doubt and with sympathy. He took off his
  sombrero and smiled at her. That act of grace made her crimson to the
  eyes.</p>

  <p>In another moment he saw that the sheriff, watch in hand, had taken his
  post at one side of the starting line, which had been made by the simple
  expedient of dragging a heel through the sand. The mare danced up to her
  place, and Lee, swinging into the saddle, sent Moonshine gliding after. Side
  by side, the dancing mare and the crouching gray&mdash;the contrasts of
  height and build were more apparent than ever. Despite his diminutive build,
  Buddy Slocum's eyes were above the level of Lee's. And big Harry Chandler, at
  the side of his jockey, tucking in the straps of his shortened stirrups, was
  commanding eagerly: "Send her out right at the start, Buddy. You hear?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Buddy, "I'll run the gray sick in the first quarter, and
  after that we'll walk in any way we feel like coming. You leave it to me,
  boss. I want his blood."</p>

  <p>Lee Garrison leaned over and ran his fingertips down the wet neck of
  Moonshine. How cruelly unfair it was that the king of the wild horses should
  be thus tricked into defeat! And by this long-legged racer, unmeant for real
  use!</p>

  <p>Here the voice of the sheriff reached him, a voice pitched high to cut
  through the rising moan of the wind. "You head down for them black rocks,
  three of 'em all bunched together. You circle around them and come back here.
  Now get your horses on the line. I ain't going to get you prepared. I'm just
  going to shoot off my gun, and that's a sign for you to let 'er go!"</p>

  <p>Deftly little Buddy Slocum, pitched well forward and high above the
  saddle, with his hands stretched out on the reins, gathered the mare about
  him, and by the very touch of his fingers seemed to tell her what he expected
  her to do. His lean face wrinkled in a smile of expectancy for the wind of
  the gallop, and he rolled the whites of his eyes at Lee with venomous
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"You ain't shooting craps now, Garrison! Talking to the dice ain't going
  to help you. You're going to eat dust, cap&mdash;you're going to eat my dust.
  Steady, lady! Easy, girl!"</p>

  <p>By a miracle of control he was keeping the hind feet of the black bunched
  well forward under her, ready for the leap.</p>

  <p>"Keep quiet, folks, will you?" requested the sheriff.</p>

  <p>Mortal silence spread among the spectators, and no sooner was it
  established than the gun exploded and sent a mighty Forty-Five caliber into
  the sand.</p>

  <p>That noise, like a thrust of spurs, sent both horses away from the mark,
  but in a far different manner. Long trained for a sprinting start, Laughter,
  with quarters sinking as she dug in her heels, shot away with great bounds,
  then steadied into a long-sweeping gallop, but Moonshine, away like a ball
  bouncing off a stone, no sooner felt his head given him than he slackened his
  pace abruptly, tossed up his head, and made sure that the crowd was not
  pouring in pursuit. The slap of Lee's hand against his flank and the call of
  the master at his ear thrust him away again at a racing gait, but the
  momentary faltering had given the black a vital advantage.</p>

  <p>A straight line from head to the tip of her scanty tail, she flew into the
  lead, with even her ears flattened as though the wind of her going were too
  great to prick them against it. Low along her neck crouched Buddy Slocum, so
  glued to her that she cut the wind for her rider as well as herself.
  Moonshine, straightened out for his full effort, seemed going twice as fast,
  but ever that long, bounding stride floated the mare farther and farther
  away. The clamor was all from the supporters of Laughter. From the backers of
  Moonshine came only one deep shout of dismay. And the faces past which Lee
  was driving were blank with incredulity.</p>

  <p>His own heart was sinking like a stone. How futile the stretch and stride
  of the gray compared with that reaching gait of Laughter! Would she canter
  across the finish line, eight or nine minutes later, with Moonshine a quarter
  of a mile behind? The shame of it made him weak.</p>

  <p>Meantime Moonshine, unurged, had caught the spirit of the thing. No doubt,
  when he led a herd, some fleet-footed horse had often challenged with speed
  against speed. Now, as sail after sail is thrown to the wind and the ship
  gathers headway, so in the deep of his heart the gray was finding strength
  and greater strength to overtake the flying mare. By jerks his rate
  increased. Partly for that reason he began to keep even with the pace of
  Laughter, but there was a greater cause. Buddy Slocum had looked back and,
  the moment he saw the gap between him and the gray, began to tug at the reins
  and sit down in the saddle. No doubts remained in the jockey's heart as to
  the issue of the race. No doubts were in the minds of the gloomy men along
  the course. No doubts were with Lee Garrison. The breeze was quickening to a
  gale. The air was a rosy haze as the dust increased. If only the blast would
  grow to the dark of a sandstorm and thus mercifully veil the defeat.</p>

  <p>But now, as Moonshine drifted to within three lengths of the mare, Buddy
  Slocum twisted around and shouted: "I'm going to make it look like a race.
  You can thank me, Garrison!"</p>

  <p>His woman-sharp laughter flew back. Lee gritted his teeth and bent lower.
  Moonshine was flying at the very top of his speed, but Laughter held him even
  with consummate ease despite a sharp pull. Wear her down? They had covered
  the first mile of the course, and she was fresh as a daisy, wild for the
  running.</p>

  <p>Half a mile away were the three black rocks. Straight as a string ran the
  stallion, and Lee knew that he could maintain that gait for miles and miles,
  unfaltering. But there would be no such demand as that. The run was nearly
  half covered, and Laughter was fighting for her head!</p>

  <p>Now they were at the rocks. Her jockey took her wide, but generous as the
  loop was on which he guided her, the long-legged mare lost headway and broke
  her gait, while Moonshine, darting up on the inside, doubled around the rocks
  like a jackrabbit. He faced the wind a length in the lead. And what a wind it
  was! Even going before it, Lee had felt it fanning his back. When they faced
  it, it struck them heavily. Compressed in Sheep Valley like water narrowing
  in a flume, the breeze had strengthened to a gale, and now the speed of a
  running horse was added to it.</p>

  <p>Lee Garrison set his teeth in grim satisfaction as Moonshine shook his
  head at the blast, then pricked his ears. But the spindle-legged mare,
  designed by generations of careful breeding for speed on a track or over
  smooth meadows&mdash;how would she stand the test?</p>

  <p>Glancing back, Lee saw the mare coming like a bullet. She had her head
  now, and presently she forced swiftly past him with the ugly face of Buddy
  Slocum turned toward him with a mocking grin.</p>

  <p>Little by little the mare drew clear. She was seventy yards away with only
  the last mile of the race before them.</p>

  <p>And yet with unhesitant courage he still poured every scruple of energy
  into his work. Those at the finish line could see that the black led, but
  they could not see by how far, and over their heads the sombreros danced and
  swung as they cheered on their favorites. Lee could see tall figures thrust
  up where one climbed on the shoulders of his companions for a clearer
  estimate.</p>

  <p>To finish thirty lengths behind, there was disgrace for which no
  difference in weight could account! Those scattering outposts who had
  advanced this far down the course to watch the running of the middle of the
  race were either slapping one another upon the back and laughing
  uproariously, or else they were stunned and silent.</p>

  <p>In dreary amazement Lee studied the tall black, but it seemed to him that
  she no longer swept along with the same frictionless stride that had carried
  ground so easily during the first three miles of the running. She was
  throwing her forelegs a trifle out of line, as though she had begun to pound
  a little. Presently she stumbled heavily, slowed, and was thrust into the bit
  again by a smart blow of Slocum's whip. He was not keeping that tight rein to
  hold her in. He was merely riding her as she was accustomed to being ridden,
  not with the free head and the long rein of a cow pony, but well in hand
  every instant to keep her straight at full speed, and hold her up when she
  tired. And she was tiring now. A stumble to a fresh horse is a spur that
  makes it dart away at redoubled speed as though to leave the shame behind,
  but a tired horse takes advantage of any interruption to slacken efforts. Not
  that Laughter was by any means spent. Her faltering was the thing of an
  instant. Lee Garrison, far in the rear, barely noticed it, but he saw enough
  to make him guess the rest, and he called on Moonshine with a great
  voice.</p>

  <p>And there was an answer. In that great heart of Moonshine there was still
  an untapped reservoir of strength. The mare no longer drew away. She was held
  even. She began to come back. For that weary pressure of the wind was telling
  heavily. And Lee, riding not to win, but only to save the honor of his horse,
  stiffened in the saddle and yelled like an Indian on the warpath.</p>

  <p>Buddy Slocum jerked around to look, and in that moment he let Laughter
  founder into half a dozen strides of sand fetlock-deep. The soft going cut
  her speed in two. She struck the soft ground as though she had run into a
  wall, and came laboring onto firm going again. She had still a twenty-length
  lead, and the finish was a scant half mile away, but Buddy Slocum, feeling
  the tall mare labor and pound, and maddened by the cut of the wind against
  his face, lost his head.</p>

  <p>He snatched out his whip and went after her. She had been running
  confidently, rejoicing in her work as a good horse should, but now she saw
  the stallion gaining and felt the man who rode her go into a panic. Instead
  of the even pressure on the reins, reassuring her, there was a series of
  jerks and that whizzing whip seared her flanks. The panic of the rider ran
  into the horse. She bolted in a frenzy for two hundred yards, and then began
  to stop as though crushing weights had been added to her burden.</p>

  <p>Yet she could not lose! The finish was a scant quarter mile away, and
  twenty lengths behind came the gray; yet even a tyro now could mark the
  laboring gallop of the black. And Moonshine, in effort after effort,
  unwhipped and unspurred, increased his speed. He could tell that he gained
  even as Lee could tell, and the knowledge was to them as wine to the
  weary.</p>

  <p>And the head of Laughter was coming up&mdash;she was spent, indeed! Not
  that she gave up. No, the advantage she held was too great for that, and, if
  her heart was breaking, she was uplifted by the creed of an ancient ancestry
  that died, but never surrendered. No need of the cruel whip or the spurs that
  were goring her flanks to crimson. She was pouring out the last scruple of
  her strength, and, still five hundred yards from the end, she led by fifteen
  lengths, by forty mortal yards.</p>

  <p>It was enough to have settled all but one race in a thousand, but the men
  of Crooked Creek seemed to feel that this was perhaps the thousandth event,
  and were transformed, one and all, into rioting wild men. And every shout, it
  seemed to Lee, was a fresh source of energy that helped Moonshine on. He
  himself was stammering, groaning at the ear of the stallion. The sands washed
  dizzily beneath them. It seemed almost that the earth whirled and carried
  them back, when he looked down. But here was Laughter borne back and back
  with shortening stride and head jerking.</p>

  <p>A furlong away the rioting of the crowd grew less and less. Man after man
  was frozen into position by the agony of suspense. Some crouched and
  stretched out their arms with contorted faces. Some were turned to stone in
  the midst of cheer or groan, and, as the deep shouting of the men fell away,
  it was possible to hear the shrilling of the women more distinctly. Only a
  furlong away the sheriff was cursing the crowd back to clear the finish line,
  and now gallant Moonshine stretched his nose within four lengths of the
  blowing tail of the mare.</p>

  <p>He was weary, and he had done enough for honor. So long as he lived and
  that race was spoken of, every man would tell how the impost of extra weight
  had beaten him&mdash;never the speed of Laughter. Then it was that, at the
  side of the mob, Lee saw Sally McGuire with her hands clasped, her form bowed
  in the pain of waiting. He must draw rein. Slowly, with a breaking heart, he
  began to pull back while under the pressure he felt a shudder go through the
  gray&mdash;but more testimony that the harmony of effort between them was
  broken.</p>

  <p>Someone was shrieking hoarsely from the side: "Moonshine! Moonshine!" It
  was Billy Sidney, fallen on his knees, with his bony fists brandished in the
  air. Such a frenzy came on Lee Garrison as had swept him away when the gray
  turned toward the roar of the waterfall, that day so long ago. In an instant
  he was helping the stallion toward the line, and at every jump they gained.
  Rapidly the empty daylight between them was eaten away. Fifty yards away was
  the crowd, and men were turning their backs rather than see the inevitable.
  But it was not inevitable. The heart of Moonshine was deep as a well, and to
  the very bottom it was filled with clear courage.</p>

  <p>His nose was on her hip. It slipped onto her girth. Surely, enough had
  been done for the honor of Moonshine now! And Lee tightened the reins again
  and relaxed. And Moonshine was relaxed beneath him. The race was lost!</p>

  <p>But how could Buddy Slocum tell that, when he saw the gray head at the
  shoulder of his mare? How could he tell that in another stride the stallion
  would be falling back? He turned a face black with insane rage and fear.</p>

  <p>"Damn you!" he shouted, and slashed Moonshine straight across the face
  with the heavy lash of his whip.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Lee Garrison that cowardly blow fell on his own heart. The
  thought of the girl and the promise were erased from his mind.</p>

  <p>"Moonshine!" he shouted. "Moonshine!"</p>

  <p>The good horse had not winced from the blow. He flung himself forward
  across the line. Lee looked back. The sheriff had raised his sombrero in one
  hand and his naked revolver in the other. The silence of the crowd was like
  the silence of a church.</p>

  <p>"Moonshine by half a head!" he yelled.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; A VISIT FROM GUTTORM</h2>

  <p class="first">Moonshine, blackened with sweat, raised a high head with
  eyes that seemed to be searching the blue peaks of the distance but that
  were, in fact, waiting for the voice of the master. The voice did not speak,
  for Lee had seen Sally McGuire cover her face with her hands, and then turn
  and start slowly back for the town with a gray-headed man beside her.</p>

  <p>Yonder stood Laughter, her head low and her legs braced. Buddy Slocum had
  been torn from the saddle and literally kicked the first hundred feet of the
  distance back to Crooked Creek. Now Harry Chandler led the mare toward
  Garrison, and he mechanically dismounted to meet the vanquished. All about
  them, losers and winners hushed their noise to watch, and Harry met the
  crisis in the most kingly manner. The excitement brought color to his face.
  He carried his head high, and even managed to muster a faint smile. Lee
  Garrison, with bowed head and gloomy face, seemed more the picture of a
  defeated man. Chandler took his hand and shook it heartily.</p>

  <p>"If Laughter had won," he said, "after that scoundrelly trick of Slocum's,
  I should have given you the race and the horse anyway, Garrison. But here she
  is. Good luck goes with her."</p>

  <p>It was very well done, that speech of congratulation. It was one of those
  things that sends a chilly prickle down the backs of the bystanders. But Lee,
  patting the wet forehead of the mare lightly, touched Harry by the arm as he
  was turning away.</p>

  <p>"But I've got a horse," said Lee, "that does for my needs pretty well.
  Chandler, I can't take her. She's yours."</p>

  <p>It was too much for Harry. His nerve crumpled.</p>

  <p>"D'you think I'd take charity, Garrison? Give her away, if you don't want
  her. Feed her to the dogs. I'm through with her!"</p>

  <p>And with a contorted face, more maddened by the knowledge that he had
  destroyed the effect of his previous acting, he plunged through the mob and
  was gone. That departure cost only a momentary cloud, however. Even the men
  who had backed Laughter heavily declared that the race they had seen was
  worth the money they had lost, and Lee Garrison was escorted back to the town
  as a conquering hero.</p>

  <p>If he were a gambler, at least he seemed a straight one, and of his
  generosity as victor they had been witnesses. Ten minutes saw him mounted
  from the trough of suspicion to the crest of popularity. But in that time of
  victory, as they went slowly back toward the town, with the black mare led
  behind by half a dozen willing hands, Lee Garrison saw one thing only: Sally
  McGuire as she bowed her face in her hands and turned away.</p>

  <p>In the dark of the evening, when he managed to slip from the crowd, he
  went straight to his room with an aching need for solitude. But there he
  found Billy Sidney, waiting like an actor for the rise of the curtain. The
  old man stood beside the bunk, over which he had thrown his coat. He was
  smoking a pipe with his thumbs thrust under his suspenders&mdash;an attitude
  of calm weariness with life that was quite gainsaid by the flashing of his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "I got the bets down."</p>

  <p>"Good for you, Billy."</p>

  <p>"And I brought the winnings in. It ain't much. There's been more coin than
  this got together here and there. But&mdash;here it is, Lee. Here's all there
  is."</p>

  <p>He jerked the coat away and exposed the top of the heavy bunk groaning
  under a ponderous mass of gold coin, untarnishable, shimmering yellow. He
  shoveled from his pockets fresh handfuls that he had kept there for the final
  effect. Gold showered upon gold with a musical chiming.</p>

  <p>"We cleaned up the camp!" shouted Billy Sidney, fairly dancing around the
  room with joy. "Look at it, Lee! When I started betting, I was
  hollow-hearted. I was sure sick at the thought of backing Moonshine against
  that long-legged mare with the midget on her back. Right away came a rush of
  Laughter money. They offered me two to one. I took it in small chunks. It
  broke me all up to be throwing that gold coin away. But still I kept at it in
  little bets here and there. When they went up to the start, I was getting
  three to one, and, when Laughter went floating away as the race began, I got
  five to one. I bet a whole thousand ag'in' five thousand. And I could've gone
  on betting for ten to one as the race went on, but all the money was
  gone."</p>

  <p>He could not resist plunging his fingers into the mass as he spoke. As he
  raised his hands, a rain of money clattered down, some falling unheeded on
  the floor.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Samuels, her eyes pressed to the keyhole, nearly fainted at the sight
  of coined gold underfoot. Had she not been already on her knees, she might
  have fallen. But Lee Garrison had sunk wearily on his bunk.</p>

  <p>"Billy," he said, "I want one thing more'n money. I want to be alone."</p>

  <p>Billy Sidney loosed with a single crash all the coins that remained in his
  hands. Then he nodded in admiration. "Still scheming&mdash;never satisfied,"
  he said. "Well, that's the way with a genius." And he stole softly through
  the door.</p>

  <p>Now that he was alone, Lee blew out the lamp, but the darkness was no more
  merciful. He could see her only the more clearly. And he was glad when his
  door was opened. But it was not Billy Sidney returning. It was the heavy
  voice of Olie Guttorm that spoke.</p>

  <p>"Garrison&mdash;are you here?"</p>

  <p>"I'm here. I'll light the lamp, Olie."</p>

  <p>"I don't want no light. I can say what I got to say better in the
  dark."</p>

  <p>He closed the door, and Lee heard the sound of heavy breathing. He fumbled
  for his revolver and found it. Then he waited again.</p>

  <p>The voice of Guttorm began, again choked away to guttural murmurs, and
  finally was audible: "Garrison, it's come. I thought that the doctor could
  save Charlie for me. Did it seem much for a smart man like him to do? I ask
  you, Garrison?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"And McLeod worked hard. He got right down on his knees by the bed and
  worked hard. But it wasn't no good. Charlie began to roll his eyes and look
  every way at once and see nothing. I seen, then, that McLeod couldn't help.
  Nobody could help. It was the whip for me because of what I done to you. When
  a man does wrong, he's trying to cheat God.</p>

  <p>"I picked up Charlie in my arms and run outside with him where the
  breathing would be easier. But he kept on gasping. I tried to make a bargain.
  I called out&mdash;'God Almighty, don't kill Charlie for what I done myself.
  I'll give Garrison his half. I'll tell that he made the strike.'"</p>

  <p>The voice of the prospector swelled to thunder, then fell away.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't no good. It was too late to draw back then. Charlie was
  fighting for his breath. He begun to beat me in the face. I kept telling him
  to fight hard. But pretty soon he stopped hitting me, and I took him back
  into the light. All I was holding in my arms was nothing. My Charlie was gone
  away from me."</p>

  <p>When he could speak again, he said slowly: "I went to Judge Brown. I told
  him what I owed you, and that half of my mines belonged to you by rights. He
  done some writing. I signed it, and here it is."</p>

  <p>He found Garrison and stuffed the paper into his hand.</p>

  <p>"I kept a-hoping, somehow," said Guttorm. "I dunno why. But it seemed
  after I'd signed that paper that Charlie would come back. He didn't seem no
  more'n around the corner from me. I run all the way from the judge's shanty
  to my house. But Charlie's eyes are still closed, and he's still smiling. He
  ain't going to change."</p>

  <p>He drew a great, noisy, sobbing breath, turned with the floor creaking
  beneath his tread, and went slowly from the house. The front door slammed
  behind him. The heavy footfalls went up the street, and the rustling of the
  paper in the dark told Lee that he was rich.</p>

  <p>Rich? It meant no more to him than the sound of dead leaves in a wind. It
  seemed that the smallness of the room crowded the picture of Sally McGuire
  relentlessly upon him, and at last he went out into the darkness behind the
  house. Moonshine whinnied plaintively from the corral.</p>

  <p>He listened, unmoved, to that call. Wondering at himself, he felt the dark
  anger cloud his mind. A day before there would have seemed nothing too great
  to do for the sake of the wild horse, but now he knew that there is a price
  on all but one thing in the world, and the price of Moonshine had been
  exceeded. That beautiful, strong body that the starlight now glimmered over
  was still his, and the scorn and the hatred of Sally were his also.</p>

  <p>Yet, automatically, he went on to the fence of the corral. He had formed
  the habit of going near Moonshine whenever he was in trouble, but now, when
  the horse came near, he folded his arms on the top of a fence and dropped his
  head upon them. He would not raise his face even when the stallion sniffed
  his face, even when the stallion sniffed at his hair and whinnied in anxiety
  almost as faint as a human whisper.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28"></a>XXVIII. &mdash; TO THE CAPTAIN</h2>

  <p class="first">The truth came to him slowly, as his head lay on his arms.
  Whatever hope of one day winning Sally had glimmered before him, as the star
  haunts the pilot, was now vanished. He was roused to the dark reality of
  earthly fact. Harry Chandler was the man she loved, and that without him she
  could never be happy. And if he loved her, all Lee could do was to bring her
  marriage to Chandler closer to realization. It would be like a pouring forth
  of blood, such a work. It would be more torment than all the long agony of
  the trail behind Moonshine, for that labor was undertaken in his own behalf,
  and this would be for another.</p>

  <p>And to close the last door of hope and bolt it firmly shut is a grisly
  task. When Lee stood up straight again and turned away without a word or a
  touch for the waiting horse, he could feel the impress of pain, the wrinkles
  and the seams of new trouble already stamped upon his face. He crossed the
  street and went straight toward the little shack Chandler owned.</p>

  <p>There was a light in the small house, but it was not the steady shining of
  a lamp. Instead, the spot of illumination jumped at random here and there,
  flashed across the window, or spilled through the open doorway and streaked
  the road with white. The light ceased to rove as Lee came close. It settled
  brightly upon the face of a man in the hut, one who was packing down the
  burning coal of his pipe with a calloused forefinger before he answered. He
  was a great block of a man, with a mass of gray hair bristling on his head
  and whiskers masking the lower part of his face. He wore a red shirt, open at
  the throat and exposing a thick, corded, wrinkled neck that might have done
  credit to a Polish laborer. His fingers were habitually half bent, as though
  fixed in that position by many a year of polishing pick and shovel handle. He
  carried with him, also, that blunt and downright manner of those who tear
  their living out of the soil. And yet Lee Garrison, now drawn close, heard
  the voice of Sally McGuire address this stranger as her father.</p>

  <p>"He's gone, Dad," said the girl. "I knew that would happen. You see
  everything is in confusion. He's taken his blankets. Harry's gone."</p>

  <p>"Let him stay," grunted McGuire. "A man that runs away after he's beaten
  isn't worth calling back."</p>

  <p>"Father!" cried Sally.</p>

  <p>"Sally!" mocked her father. His tone changed to a growl. "I'm tired of
  this temperamental stuff."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll go myself!"</p>

  <p>Lee Garrison listened with a hollow heart to the thrill and the sob in her
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Go where?"</p>

  <p>"To find poor Harry and bring him back and save him from despair. He'll do
  some desperate thing. He's capable of anything, now that he considers his
  life a failure."</p>

  <p>"Rot," said McGuire. "He's off sulking. In a week he'll be back to marry
  you, if you're fool enough to throw yourself away on him."</p>

  <p>"What possible right have you to speak of him like this? You know he'll
  never marry me unless he can support me. He's told you that himself."</p>

  <p>"Which makes it Bible stuff, does it?"</p>

  <p>"Now that he's down, you speak of him like this?"</p>

  <p>"Never hit a man in my life when he was down. But I say, give Harry rope,
  and he'll run in a circle and come back. He's like a small boy that's left
  home because he got a spanking. That's all."</p>

  <p>"It's that detestable liar and hypocrite&mdash;!" She could not finish the
  sentence. She paused, indignant.</p>

  <p>"You're blaming this on the gambler&mdash;on Garrison? I tell you, Sally,
  a fellow who can ride as he did today can't be all wrong. He gave you a
  promise to quiet you, that was all. Of course, he couldn't keep it. And what
  under the heavens possessed you to try to buy him off?"</p>

  <p>"To save Harry."</p>

  <p>"A man that needs a woman's saving isn't worth being saved."</p>

  <p>"I won't be answered with stale maxims. You talk as if I were a
  coward."</p>

  <p>"There are more kinds of courage than that which takes a man through a
  fight."</p>

  <p>Oh, wise, wise brain under shock of wild gray hair, how the heart of Lee
  Garrison hung upon his words. It was as though a brave and skillful champion
  stood in the lists, fighting his battle.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you're like all the rest!" cried the girl. "You hate him
  because he failed today. But I tell you it only makes me prouder to fight for
  him and show him that my faith has never wavered."</p>

  <p>"You don't have to tell me that. Give a woman a lost cause&mdash;that's
  all she wants. She'll throw her heart away on it! And you've found your
  hopeless case."</p>

  <p>"Father!" cried Sally McGuire.</p>

  <p>"Bah!" roared the inelegant McGuire. "That yap&mdash;that big four-
  flusher! He makes me tired. I saw through him a year ago. Man to man, Sally,
  like the honest little woman you are, confess to me that you are all wrapped
  up in Chandler simply because you think you may be able to save him&mdash;
  make something useful out of him. Confess, Sally, it's a sort of missionary
  interest."</p>

  <p>She could master her indignation barely enough to permit speech. "Have you
  finished insulting me and the man I love?" she managed to ask.</p>

  <p>"I'm through. But I couldn't hold it in any longer. I've been swallowing
  what I think of Chandler all these months."</p>

  <p>"Then let me go."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"To find him."</p>

  <p>"Sally!"</p>

  <p>"To find him, if I have to spend the rest of my life in the search. Let me
  go, Dad."</p>

  <p>"Let you ride off alone&mdash;at night? Good heavens, Sally, are you
  mad?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you, I shall go."</p>

  <p>"Sally, this isn't like you. I've argued you into a frenzy. Don't ruin
  your life, following the first wild-headed impulse. By heaven, I'm talking to
  the wind. Sally, if you must go, I'll go with you."</p>

  <p>"I don't want you."</p>

  <p>"You know that I'll never let you go alone. But, step out here and look at
  those black mountains. You see how foolish it is to try to follow him in this
  country?"</p>

  <p>They passed through the doorway. They would surely have seen Lee Garrison
  as he shrank to the side had it not been that they were so filled with their
  own thoughts.</p>

  <p>"I know where to find him," she declared, her voice made soft and smaller
  by the presence of the wide night. "When we came over the mountains, do you
  remember that gorge with a straight wall of rhyolite on one side and a slope
  tucked away under the bluff?"</p>

  <p>"I remember," muttered McGuire. "It was just this side of The
  Captain."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Harry and I both thought it was a lovely valley. And that day we
  agreed that&mdash;in a word, Dad, I know that Harry will go there first and
  wait to see if something doesn't bring me to him."</p>

  <p>"He's mighty reckless," said McGuire. "He runs away without saying a word.
  Sally, it would take a night of riding. It would be dawn before we reached
  that valley under The Captain."</p>

  <p>"Have I asked you to come?"</p>

  <p>She hurried away, almost running, and Lee heard her father groan, then set
  out in pursuit. He watched them disappear. A fragment of talk from a passing
  group of men drifted upon his mind.</p>

  <p>"I was sitting on a stull and gadding out a hitch. I heard the drum
  groaning out, and I knew that pair of mules had balked again. Pretty soon I
  hear Joe hollering down the shaft. He says to me&mdash;'These here mules
  don't think much of this mine. They ain't got no heart in the work.' And I
  hollers back to Joe like I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The voice of the narrator drifted to an unintelligible jumble, and
  Garrison returned to his own thoughts. The talk he had overheard fitted into
  his preconceptions as perfectly as though it had been planned on a stage.
  Here was a demonstration that proved how utterly the girl loved Harry
  Chandler, how blank her life would be without him. All the doubts that had
  been lingering like hope in the corners of his brain were expelled.</p>

  <p>He went back to the corral behind Mrs. Samuels's house. Moonshine greeted
  his return with an ecstasy, but Lee cut his antics short with the first
  abrupt word he had ever spoken to the stallion, and after that the horse
  stood quiet as a mouse, his head turned in wonder as he watched Lee
  saddle.</p>

  <p>After that, Lee brought him to the front of the house. He carried out a
  hundred pounds of gold coin and dumped it into the saddlebags. Then he swung
  into the saddle and headed east and north toward The Captain.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29"></a>XXIX. &mdash; THE FATAL SHOT</h2>

  <p class="first">Dawn found him in a wilderness of tumbled mountain heads,
  and, while the rough crest of The Captain was bright with rosy light, Lee
  Garrison looked down beneath the great peak into a valley all awash with
  shadow. The south wall of that gulch was an abrupt cliff of rhyolite, a
  delicate mingling of colors now, like a garden seen by the half light of
  dusk. From the north there was a tumble of hills and smoothly dropping
  slopes, pine-covered, and where the trees crowded, thickened in the heart of
  the valley, a stream wound. He saw its silver flashing here and there.</p>

  <p>The day grew brighter by the moment. The radiance stole down the rhyolite
  cliff to its base. The evergreens were shimmering. In the clearings the
  narrow river flashed, and from one strip of white water he heard the deep and
  distant voice of the cascades. Morning had swept around him at a step. He
  moved to the left. Now he could see the base of the cliff, with a little
  cabin squatted against the rock in a setting of huge boulders, and a single
  horseman was going toward it. He needed no glass to spy that man out and tell
  he was Harry Chandler.</p>

  <p>There was only one care in his mind when he sent the stallion down the
  slope in pursuit. He must be finished with Chandler and out of the valley
  before McGuire and Sally came up, and how far he was ahead of them he could
  not guess. For with that chinking burden in the saddlebags, he had spared
  Moonshine more than usual, more than there was need, it seemed, for now, at
  the end of that long, arduous trail, the gray ran as lightly as ever, his
  gallop as swift and free as the winging of a bird. Even on this grim morning
  that gallop raised the heart of Lee Garrison, made him lift his head, and
  brought the faintest of smiles upon his worn face.</p>

  <p>He ran his hand with a caress along the neck of the horse, and Moonshine
  tossed his head with pricking ears and whinnied joyously as he ran. For, as
  Lee suddenly remembered, it was the first time during all the night that he
  had given the stallion so much as a touch of the hand, far less a single word
  to hearten him at his labor. And how happily Moonshine ran now, turning his
  head to examine the forest as he passed, or glancing up at an impudent hawk
  stooped close overhead, or bounding to the side with simulated fear as they
  shot past a lightning-stricken, white ghost of a tree.</p>

  <p>The pines thinned before them, scattered to nothing, and curving around
  the shoulder of a low knoll, he came in view of Harry Chandler. He was in the
  act of drawing the saddle from a sweat-blackened horse, not a hundred yards
  away, at the door of the cabin.</p>

  <p>Harry saw him at the same instant. The saddle dropped from his hands.
  "What the devil do you mean by following?" he called.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you," answered Lee. His voice jerked away to nothing. A brook
  separated the two men, and Moonshine was crossing it as a greyhound could
  hardly have done, avoiding the cold, black pools of deep water and leaping
  with consummate skill from the slippery rocks of one shallows to land with
  bunched feet on the next. So he wove his way across the stream with Lee
  enchanted by that adroitness until the yell of Chandler struck hammer-like
  against his ear over the rushing of the water.</p>

  <p>"Keep back, Garrison. I warn you fairly. Come a step nearer&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>What was in his mind? It was incredible. It was madness to think
  of&mdash;and yet now into Chandler's hand came the long, gleaming body of a
  Colt revolver.</p>

  <p>"Keep back!" he yelled. And before Lee could rally his bewildered wits,
  before he could swerve the gray horse with a touch on the bridle: "Then take
  it on your own head, damn you!"</p>

  <p>The gun barked, jerking up its nose with the recoil as though rearing to
  see what mischief it had done. Mischief enough! For Moonshine stopped and
  half reared as the bullet struck, then rallied, and sprang for the shore. As
  for Lee, he could not move, he could not think. This was a dream of things
  that could not be. Only in a nightmare could a man stand with black hatred in
  his face and murder a horse! But there was Harry Chandler, transformed to a
  fiend, bringing down his revolver to the level again.</p>

  <p>Once more! The report broke louder as they left the bank with a force that
  knocked Lee over and over in the dirt and gravel, till a log stopped him with
  a crash. He saw Moonshine turning toward him and sinking on trembling legs.
  Down slumped the hindquarters. Still, propped on the shaking forelegs, his
  ears pricked, the gray horse neighed toward the master and struggled in vain
  to lift himself and come. But all that unmatchable strength was withering out
  of his body. There was no power of sinew and muscle now, but still the great
  spirit looked out of his eyes at Lee, and there was never a glance for the
  man who was killing him. One knee buckled to the ground, then the other, the
  proud neck with its wind-lifted mane fell lower, and Moonshine lay dead among
  the rocks.</p>

  <p>"And now you!" shouted the madman who had been Harry Chandler.</p>

  <p>He shattered the stream of his own oaths with the explosions of his gun. A
  handful of gravel was scuffed into the face of Lee Garrison. That was the
  work of the first bullet. The second spattered to water on the face of a
  quartzite rock. Then Lee came to his feet. That he was facing a leveled
  revolver did not matter. That the man behind the gun bulked twice as large as
  he was a little thing. A sort of insane energy was burning in his brain,
  turning his muscles to iron. To the hysterical speed with which his mind was
  working the movements of Harry Chandler seemed ridiculously slow, as though
  he were gesturing on a stage. His revolver had jammed as Lee sprang up. He
  struggled with it an instant, then hurled it at the head of Garrison. It
  brushed past the ear of Lee, and the next instant Lee had closed on the
  murderer, his stiff fingers buried in flesh.</p>

  <p>It was strangely easy. He was filled with perfect certainty, complete
  assurance. The fist of Harry beat into his face. He caught that flying arm by
  the wrist. He held it with bone-crushing force and smiled into the eyes of
  Harry Chandler who shrieked as even a brave man cries out when a beast closes
  in on him. Chandler strove to tear himself free, but his powerful body was
  turned to a figure of sand. Lee Garrison raised Chandler as he might have
  lifted a great, loosely filled sack and dashed him to the ground. The head of
  Harry struck a rock, jarred far to the side, and then the great body lay
  still.</p>

  <p>Lee went back to the horse, but the brave eyes were dull. He ran his
  fingers down the neck, silken smooth, still warm with life. Realization came
  to him in wave on wave as a ship sinks, staggering down, down, till the water
  licks quite across its decks. Moonshine would never rise again. Moonshine
  would never run again. Moonshine was dead.</p>

  <p>So the fruit of that first great adventure was vanished. Then he turned to
  Chandler with the last of his insane fury melting out of his brain. The
  strength left his body. His limbs trembled, and his knees shook under his
  weight as he went to see if the quest were, indeed, ended with two
  deaths.</p>

  <p>Crimson stained the pebbles on which the head of Chandler lay. His eyes
  were closed, his face wax-pale, but, even as Lee dropped to his knees beside
  him, the prostrate man stirred, groaned, opened his eyes. The nightmare of
  fear came back into them as he saw Lee. He dared not rise.</p>

  <p>"Sit up," said Lee.</p>

  <p>The other obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Stand up."</p>

  <p>Chandler rose.</p>

  <p>"You're not hurt bad," said Lee. "Go inside the cabin. There's something
  out here we don't want to see."</p>

  <p>Chandler cast a glance at the body of the stallion, another wild glance at
  Lee, still a third look at the revolver he had thrown away, and obeyed. As
  for Lee, he delayed only to unbuckle the saddlebags. Then he followed
  Chandler in and cast the pouches of coin upon the floor. They fell with a
  heavy crunching of metal.</p>

  <p>Harry had tied a white handkerchief around his head to stop the bleeding.
  Now he sat on the side of a bunk that was built against the wall in one
  corner of the shack.</p>

  <p>"Chandler," said Lee, "You shot to kill Moonshine."</p>

  <p>The fascinated eyes of Chandler widened, fixed on the revolver that hung
  in the other's holster, then jerked up to his face.</p>

  <p>"I shot for you, Garrison," he said. "That first time I aimed to get you,
  and, when I saw that I'd missed and hit the horse instead&mdash;I went
  crazy&mdash;I didn't know what I was doing."</p>

  <p>"So you shot again&mdash;at Moonshine."</p>

  <p>Chandler drew in a long, gasping breath. He was collapsing, shrinking
  smaller and smaller.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know what I was doing. I.&mdash;" His voice was beginning to
  tremble, sure warning that he was about to break down, and a horror came to
  Lee of the shameful thing that might be just ahead.</p>

  <p>"I believe you, Harry," he said hurriedly. "I've got to believe you. I
  believe that you aimed to get me with that first slug, and&mdash;otherwise,
  what sort of a husband would you make for her? How could she be happy with
  you?"</p>

  <p>The question broke off sharply. He was talking swiftly, arguing with
  himself, and such arguments are always won.</p>

  <p>"Chandler, I've heard about you. You've told Sally you'll not marry her
  till you've got money of your own to support her. Maybe you'd like to change
  your mind. Maybe it's fear of her father that keeps you from changing. I
  dunno, but I guess a lot. Only the main thing is that she wants you. Look
  here, Chandler. Here's more than ten thousand dollars in cash. That's enough
  money for a man to marry on. It's money that Moonshine made for me, and I'll
  never use it."</p>

  <p>"Just a moment," said Harry. He started up from his seat. "Did you trail
  me up here to offer me that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And I&mdash;what have I done to you? Garrison, can you forgive me?"</p>

  <p>The hand he had extended fell.</p>

  <p>"If it had been me that dropped," said Lee, "and if I'd seen Moonshine
  running free while I died, then I could have forgiven you clean and free. It
  would have been the right ending. Now what matters is that she wants you.
  Will you go to her?"</p>

  <p>"Man, man," said Harry, "how can I take your money?"</p>

  <p>"Because all I can do for her is to give her the man she loves. You'll
  take what I offer? You'll swear to go back to her?"</p>

  <p>His voice had risen, and Chandler shrank back from him.</p>

  <p>"I swear, Garrison."</p>

  <p>"Saddle your horse and start. Ride down the valley. You'll meet her coming
  this way."</p>

  <p>He sat on the edge of the bunk with his face dropped in his hands. He
  heard the floor creak under the weight of Chandler, heard the rattle of the
  coin as the saddlebags were lifted, heard the flop of the saddle as it was
  swung onto the back of the horse. He heard the creak and strain of the
  stirrup leather as Chandler lifted himself into place. He heard the grinding
  of pebbles under hoof. And still he waited through the dragging moments. At
  last he went out. He sat down by his horse and took the lifeless head in his
  lap.</p>

  <p>Now into his mind flowed the quiet music of the creek, and beyond that the
  bird voices out of the trees or in the wind, and he heard, too, the buzz and
  faint singing of insects, hunting through the grass around him. But above all
  these noises the silence of the mountains was king, just as it overpowered
  the tumult of the mines in Crooked Creek. And he knew that when the years
  went by the happy days to which his mind would go back were those times when,
  in the long agony of the quest for Moonshine, he had paused in the morning or
  the twilight and waited for the mountain silence to step in swiftly around
  him, and in his memory and in his daydreams Moonshine would never be
  captured.</p>

  <p>A shadow fell across the brightness of his spur, and he looked up into the
  face of McGuire, standing beside him. Had he dropped out of the bodiless air?
  No, behind him was the horse Chandler had been riding, and McGuire's face was
  a scowl as he puffed steadily at his pipe. How long ago could he have come up
  the trail under the cliff?</p>

  <p>"Garrison," he said, "Harry told us what happened. They went back in the
  buggy. I rode on up here on Harry's hoss. It was a damned shame&mdash;the way
  this accident happened. Sally wanted for me to tell you she intends to raise
  a monument for him&mdash;to carve his name&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He bowed his face then, feeling that these words were useless, almost
  cruel, feeling as much a loss in Sally as perhaps Garrison felt with
  Moonshine.</p>

  <p>"Tell me only one thing," Lee said. "Did the two of you ever live one
  summer in a cabin in the Samson Mountains?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not," affirmed McGuire. "Oh, Sally told me about it, son&mdash;
  about the glove&mdash;but she said she never had such a glove as that in all
  her life. It was just&mdash;well, she somehow could never tell you that
  herself&mdash;you were so sure of it." He shook his head sadly. "I'm truly
  sorry, son&mdash;truly sorry."</p>
