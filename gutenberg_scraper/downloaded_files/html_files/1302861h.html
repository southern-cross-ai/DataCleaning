<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. &mdash; THE DECISION</h2>

<p class="first">Someone who knew what he was talking about said
that no man should go into the West, the real frontier West, that
is, unless he was capable of inspiring some measure of awe. Perhaps
by his personal dignity, which is, after all, the best way of
keeping a man out of trouble. Or through physical strength or mere
size, or by dauntless power of eye, or through fighting
skill&mdash;any or all of these attributes would be most
serviceable. But Sammy Gregg did not have any of them.</p>

<p>He wasn't a whit more than eight inches above five feet, and he
did not even stand straight enough to take advantage of all of
those meager inches. He walked with a slight stoop, as a rule,
leaning over like a man about to start from a walk to a run. He
looked as though he were always in a hurry, and as a matter of
fact, he usually was. His weight was about a hundred and thirty
pounds, or a trifle more in winter, and a little less when the hot
weather of the summer began to set in. It was not tough,
well-seasoned muscle, either. It was quite flabby. And he had small
bones, and little, narrow, nervous hands.</p>

<p>His eyes were pale, and rather near-sighted, so that he had a
half- frightened look, when it wasn't simply wistfully inquiring.
His pale forehead was constantly contorted with a frown, which was
not a frown of bad temper, but of eagerness.</p>

<p>The only truly remarkable thing about Sammy, indeed, was that
same eagerness. Like the eagerness of a hunting ferret, if you can
imagine a ferret without teeth! But one felt about Sammy a vast
earnestness, rooted as deep as the roots of his soul, a singular
intentness in which he was absorbed.</p>

<p>That was the secret of the bigness that was in Sammy; for some
bigness there was. The trouble was, the West and the people of the
West were not fitted for understanding this small man.</p>

<p>I suppose, for that matter, that he was a rarity in almost any
climate. He had the simplicity of a child mixed oddly with some of
the guile of a serpent, I am afraid. It was always very hard to
understand Sammy. I, for one, never could pretend to hold the key
to his complex nature. I can only describe him as he was.</p>

<p>In the first place, he did not come West to raise cattle nor
horses, nor to ride herd on the cow range, nor to dig gold for
himself nor any other, nor to start up as a storekeeper in one of
the new towns.</p>

<p>He came West with five thousand dollars in his pockets and a
desire to invest it! Choice he had none. He was ready for anything
out of which he might make money.</p>

<p>You will think that he would have been wiser to sink that sum of
money in a bank rather than expose it naked to the air of that
climate where gold turned so quickly to bloody rust! But I must add
one more thing to my characterization of Sammy Gregg. He was not
afraid. There was no fear in him. Fear did not interest Sammy, but
dollars did!</p>

<p>Not from a blind love of coin, either. The impelling motive was
love for a girl who kept house for an uncle in a Brooklyn flat and
waited for word from Sammy from the wilderness. Sammy had found the
lady of his heart long before he ever got on the train which
brought him to Munson.</p>

<p>Oh, unromantic Sammy! He had fallen in love with her not
suddenly, and not from any exciting meeting, but simply because
this fair-haired girl had been known to him during his entire life.
She had grown up in the backyard next to his. He had made faces at
her when he was five years old, peering at her through a hole in
the board fence; and that day she ran crying into her house for
fear of him. Afterward, he walked to school with her at his side,
regardless of the other boys who pointed their fingers at him.</p>

<p>Sammy had no time for the opinions of outsiders. If you consider
it from the most logical point of view, you will see that we
indulge ourselves in a luxury when we spend energy to conciliate
the good will of our neighbors. And Sammy never had any extra
strength to spend. He was not, in short, interested in public
opinion; and that was why he was such an oddity as I, for one, have
never seen the like of.</p>

<p>I should not say that Sammy loved Susie with a devouring passion
as he grew up. But she was a part of his life. He cared for her as
he cared for himself, I might say. He had admitted her into his
life, and she had grown into it like a graft into the trunk of a
tree. He thought of her as often as he thought of himself. And if
he were not passionately unhappy when he was away from her, he was
certainly worried and irritated and confused and ill at ease. When
he was at her side, he did not want to kiss her or fondle her or
say foolish things to her, or even hold her hand. But he was
satisfied, as a cow is satisfied when it is in its own pasture,
near its own red barn.</p>

<p>So he saved and scraped and lived cheaply and labored earnestly
at his jobs. He was out of school at fifteen, and he was constantly
contributing to the savings bank on the first of every month until
one day in his twenty-fifth year when he had a little talk with
Susie Mitchell.</p>

<p>"When are we to be married?" asked Susie.</p>

<p>"Oh, some day," said Sammy. "When I get enough money to live on
right."</p>

<p>"I'm twenty-five, the same as you," said Susie. "That's not so
young!"</p>

<p>He looked askance at her in wonder. But her pretty face was very
grave and her blue eyes&mdash;as pale and gentle as his
own&mdash;were fixed firmly upon his face.</p>

<p>"Besides, said Susie, "I don't go in for style. You know that. I
don't mind working. I don't mind a small house to live in. I don't
aim much higher than what my mother got when she married. But I
think that it's time we married, and had some children, and things
like that. Jiminy, Sammy, you've got a lot more than most young
fellows have! And look what a swell salary you get, fifteen a week.
A regular position, I call it, down there at the paper mill, where
you'll be raised, too, after four or five years more. The manager
certainly told you about that himself."</p>

<p>Mind you, this was long before the day when carpenters got as
much a day as Sammy worked for in a week. In the time of which I
write, sixty dollars a month was enough for an "office" man, with
many other men under him, assistants, and all that. Those were the
days when the boys pointed out the man who lived in the big corner
house, because it was said that he got a hundred and a quarter a
month!</p>

<p>So sixty dollars was quite a bit, but it was not enough for
Sammy. He said, "Let me have a chance to think this over." Then he
went away and reviewed his position.</p>

<p>In the first place, he had to marry Susie, there was no doubt
about that. And he had to marry her quick. He would as soon dream
of going on through life without her as he would dream of going on
through life without a leg or without two legs! Susie was simply a
part of his spirit and of his flesh, too. But he was afraid of
marriage. He had seen other youths attempt marriage, and he had
seen children and accompanying doctor bills and ill health break
down their savings, ruin their nerves, keep them awake with worry,
and fill their lives with gloom.</p>

<p>Sammy would not stand the chance of such a disaster, because he
knew his own strength, and he knew that it could not endure through
sleepless nights. He felt that he could never marry unless he could
marry comfortably. And he had established as a goal a sum of
fifteen thousand dollars. With that amount working for him at
interest, he would be safe. Even if he lost his health, he could
support his family on that same interest until he was well again.
Fifteen thousand dollars, a goal still ten thousand dollars away,
and Susie wanted to get married.</p>

<p>He came back to Susie. He said, "I am going away for six months.
Will you wait that long?"</p>

<p>"Going away!" cried Susie.</p>

<p>"To make ten thousand dollars!"</p>

<p>Susie laughed, at first. But when she saw that he was in
earnest, she was filled with a sort of religious awe. It seemed
hardly moral and decent for a young fellow to speak of hoping to
make ten thousand dollars in a mere half year! It had never been
done in her family. It made her almost think of enchantment,
certainly it made her think very strongly of crime!</p>

<p>She could almost see her little Sammy Gregg with a black mask
tied across the bridge of his nose and a stub-nosed revolver
clutched in his hand stealing up behind the back of some florid
banker! She could almost see it, and the thing gave her a shock of
horror.</p>

<p>"Don't go, Sammy!" she breathed to him. "Don't go, Sammy!"</p>

<p>He did not listen to her. He hardly heard her voice. He was
filled with his own thoughts, which were already in a faraway
country where dollars grew more readily than they grew in Brooklyn.
He was thinking of the accounts which flooded newspapers and
magazines from time to time of great fortunes scooped up by a
single gesture of the wise men.</p>

<p>In crises we are apt to stop thinking and fall back upon
superstitions, religion, fairy tales. So did young Sammy Gregg. He
decided to follow his new vision. It was a "hunch," and for the
first time in his life he was about to do a risky thing. I had to
explain all of this because without understanding a little of the
background of Sammy, it would be quite impossible to make head or
tail of him as he was when he appeared before the grinning populace
of Munson, that rude little city in the Western hills.</p>

<p>But if Sammy performed at times feats which seemed well beyond
his strength, you must remember that there was a spur driven
constantly into his soul&mdash;the loss of Susie.</p>

<p>He was in a constant misery. For he was away from her!</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. &mdash; IN MUNSON</h2>

<p class="first">The train stopped, and Sammy swung down from the
steps and reached for a platform, but unfortunately he found none.
The sight of that swinging, pawing foot of his, and his skinny leg,
was enough to catch half a dozen wicked eyes. He was already being
laughed at before he dropped down to the ground and presented all
of himself for the first time to the eye of Munson.</p>

<p>Before he had well landed, Lawson himself was in charge. The
first thing he did was to let out a yell which so startled young
Sammy that he almost leaped backward under the wheels of the slowly
moving train.</p>

<p>Sammy, however, was perfectly lacking in the very thing of which
Munson was full&mdash;self-consciousness. He did not dream, after a
moment of reflection, that that yell had been meant for him. So he
simply picked up his heavy grip and stepped forward toward the
crooked little dusty street where the sign said "hotel." He stepped
forward, and as he walked he settled his hat more firmly on his
head.</p>

<p>Alas it was a derby hat!</p>

<p>I cannot tell what made an "iron" hat a mortal offense in the
West, but it was. It required an almost presidential reputation to
enable a man to keep one on his head. And what reputation had poor
Sammy Gregg?</p>

<p>Before he knew it, Lawson had loosed off a couple of bullets
that struck the ground in front of Sammy and covered him with a
stinging shower of dust and flying gravel. He jumped, of course,
straight up into the air.</p>

<p>It brought a shout of willing laughter from everyone, because
Lawson never appeared without his "gang." I wish I could give a
thorough picture of Lawson, but I can't. Words become weak,
speaking of the poisonous evil of such natures as his. He was that
most gruesome combination&mdash;weakness and wickedness combined.
He was a coward, a bully, a tyrant, a sneak, a moral wreck of a
man; but he was a hero, in Munson, because he could shoot straight.
And the consciousness that he could shoot straight always made him
brave.</p>

<p>Cowards always make the most horrible tyrants simply because
they are so familiar with the emotion which they wish to
inspire&mdash;fear.</p>

<p>Now the weak mouth of Lawson stretched in a grin. And his
little, close-set eyes gleamed under the shadow of his sombrero. He
put another bullet neatly in the ground just where the feet of
Sammy were about to land, and when they did land, Sammy naturally
bounded into the air again.</p>

<p>"Dance, confound you!" yelled Lawson.</p>

<p>But Sammy stood still. He said nothing for a moment, but when
another bullet struck the ground at his feet, he said calmly, "I
don't think I'll dance."</p>

<p>Lawson was staggered, for suddenly he saw that this little man
was not afraid. Then he broke out in a savage roar, "When you speak
to a man, take off your hat, tenderfoot!"</p>

<p>He did not wait for Sammy to obey. His gun spoke, and the bullet
tore the hat from the head of Sammy. It was very close shooting, no
one could deny that. It brought another roar of applause and
laughter when the crowd saw Sammy instinctively duck. But then he
leaned and picked up his hat and settled it, dusty as it was, upon
his head once more.</p>

<p>"You'll come and liquor with me, kid," said Lawson. "I'm going
to see how your insides act when you get some of Mortimer's poison
inside of you. And bring the other dude along with you, boys!"</p>

<p>Sammy could not keep the center of the stage very long. Not with
such a counter attraction as had dismounted from the same train. It
was a tall man, a tall, wide-shouldered, handsome man of thirty,
perhaps, dressed in a fashion which Munson could not tolerate for
an instant, in those days. He wore riding boots, to be sure, but
the boots were not under his trousers, and that was a sin, of
course. And above the boots rose neat whipcord riding breeches.
There was a well-fitted gray coat, and a gray shirt with a shining
white stiff collar and a natty bow tie, and this gentleman was
finished off with a small gray felt hat on his head. He carried a
suitcase of large dimensions with "C.O.F." stamped in big letters
on the side of it.</p>

<p>He made the counter attraction. He looked just as much of a
tenderfoot as Sammy did, and there was more of him. The crowd
surrounded him in an instant, and he and Sammy were huddled off
toward Mortimer's saloon in a trice.</p>

<p>Huddled off with this difference, that whereas many hands were
laid upon Sammy, urging him along, beating his derby hat down over
his eyes, cuffing and pawing him, there was not so much as the tip
of a finger laid upon the tall man. I cannot tell why. Perhaps it
was the calmness of his face and eye. Perhaps it was the wrinkle of
his coat between the shoulder blades, telling of ample muscles
there. At any rate, though they milled about him, yelling and
cursing and laughing, no one touched him, and so the procession
burst into Mortimer's.</p>

<p>He was the headquarters for such affairs, was Mortimer. He was
also the gambling partner and the partner in secret murders who
worked with my friend Lawson. And he was only just a trifle less
savory than Mr. Lawson. He greeted the new victims with a veritable
yell of delight and instantly the glasses were set chiming upon the
bar. And the big black bottles were spun out.</p>

<p>Lawson stood at one end of the bar and gave directions.</p>

<p>"To the top, kid. To the top, both of you. Fill up them glasses
to the top, I tell you!"</p>

<p>Sammy set his teeth and obeyed. He didn't like it, but neither
did he throw away his life for such a small affair as this. So he
filled as he was ordered.</p>

<p>But, after that, a deadly hush fell over the bar-room, for it
was seen that the tall man, in spite of the order from Lawson, had
not touched the waiting bottle to pour his drink.</p>

<p>He spoke before the wrath of Lawson could descend upon him.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said he, "I shall be charmed to drink with you, but
first I'd like to give you my name, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>He spoke so mildly that they could hardly help but misunderstand
him, and the snarl of mockery awoke instantly. However, Lawson
appeared to scent an opportunity for further mischief than usual,
and he raised his voice to control the murmur.</p>

<p>"All right," said he. "Let's hear your name, and darned if I
don't think that it ought to begin with Percy!"</p>

<p>A poor jest, but Lawson did not have to invent very witty
remarks in order to win the applause of his fellows. While the
laughter was still ringing, however, the big stranger sauntered to
the stove. It was a raw spring day with a whistling wind from the
snow-tipped mountains of the north, prying through the cracks and
sending long, chill fingers of draft waving through the rickety
saloon.</p>

<p>The stove was packed with wood; the stove itself was red hot,
and the door was open to throw out a greater draft. And in that
open door the poker lay, just as it had been dropped when the wood
was last stirred and replenished. To this stepped the tall man and
drew forth the poker, and with it in his hand he approached the
bar.</p>

<p>He raised it, and with the white point he began to write upon
the wood. He had half completed the first word of his writing
before Mortimer intervened, for this audacity had paralyzed our
saloon keeper with rage and wonder. When his voice returned to him,
it was like the challenging bellow of a bull. He clapped the muzzle
of his revolver on the edge of the bar. Then from the ample throat
of Mortimer throbbed a stream of cursing that filled the room with
storming echoes.</p>

<p>The tall man calmly laid down the poker, where it burned a deep
gouge in the wood. His left hand glided out unhurrying, but swift
as the flick of a whiplash. It laid hold upon the barrel of
Mortimer's gun, so that the bullet of that gentleman hummed idly
under the arm of the tenderfoot. And, at the same time, with his
right hand he drew forth a hidden Colt revolver, long and heavy and
black, placed the muzzle against the breast of Mortimer, and
fired.</p>

<p>Mortimer, dead before he struck the floor, collapsed in a pool
of crimson behind the bar.</p>

<p>The silence which followed was so intense that the crowd could
hear the ticking of a clock in the back room and the hissing of the
wood beneath the hot end of the poker as the tall man wrote the
rest of his name upon the bar.</p>

<p>"Chester Ormonde Furness," he wrote, and stood back and dropped
the poker to the floor while his name still smoked upon the
bar.</p>

<p>"That is my name, gentlemen," said he. "I trust that you are
glad to see me. Gladder, at least, than I am to see you. Because I
have been over a considerable section of this little world, and not
even in Singapore, where the scum of the world is dropped after it
has been skimmed from the pot&mdash;not even in Singapore, or in
Shanghai, nor in the New York slums, from which I think a good many
of you have come, have I seen such a worthless lot of cowardly,
sneaking riffraff, fakers, sham giants, cur dogs wearing lion
skins. And about the worst in this very bad lot seems to be Mr.
Lawson. Will you step out, Mr. Lawson?"</p>

<p>Mr. Lawson had not turned white. His complexion did not permit
that color. But he turned a very pale greenish-yellow. He did not
step forward. He whirled, instead, toward the door, and tried to
spring through it. But, just at that moment, a gun cracked behind
him, and a .45-caliber Colt's bullet cracked the door from top to
bottom.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawson did not make the mistake of imagining that it was a
missed shot. He stopped in his tracks and turned slowly back to
face Chester Ormonde Furness.</p>

<p>"Do you know my name?" said the stranger.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Furness," said Lawson.</p>

<p>"Why I don't finish you," said Furness, "I hardly know. I
suppose it's because there is a sporting instinct in me, and I like
to have a little fun with my shooting. I like to give the game a
start, so I am going to give you a start, Lawson. Go through that
door and start up the street. I'll follow you with my gun!"</p>

<p>Lawson did not wait for a second invitation. He sprang back
through the door and Furness glided after him. And then the rest of
awestricken Munson had sight of the terrible Lawson sprinting with
all his might down the street while a tall "dude" stood in the road
behind him and emptied a Colt, missing him by neatly calculated
distances which the crowd could appreciate. For every time Furness
fired, Lawson leaped to one side or the other with a wild howl
until he found a corner to dodge around into safety.</p>

<p>When Mr. Furness finished his shooting he put away his gun,
swiftly and neatly, so that no lump showed where it rested. Then he
turned upon the gaping crowd&mdash;a tamed, humbled crowd, now
grinning sheepishly in anticipation at him.</p>

<p>"I detest trouble," said Mr. Furness. "I always strive to avoid
it. And I want you to remember what I say. I want you to remember
it and repeat it to your cronies wherever you may meet them. Tell
them that I expect to stay for a considerable time in this town. I
expect to become well acquainted with Munson and the neighborhood
around it. But I expect to live here in peace. When I say 'peace,'
I mean it.</p>

<p>"I intend to rent a house and to live quietly in it on the edge
of town. I do not wish to have my sleep disturbed at night. And, if
there is a noisy riot, I shall come out and put an end to the good
time if I can. If a stray bullet from a brawl happens to find its
way through my window, you may trust that I shall find the man who
fired it.</p>

<p>"Beyond this I wish to say that I desire to have my name handled
gently. If there is any vicious talk, I want you to know that I
possess an exceedingly sensitive nature, and I shall find the
vicious talkers, gentlemen, and I shall kill those vicious talkers
if I am able. I am well aware that there is no law in Munson, at
the present moment. And I hereby give notice that my own laws I
shall enforce with a gun. And now, gentlemen, I want you to
understand, finally, that I quite sympathize with the error into
which you have fallen concerning me. To you I looked rather soft.
If you have found that I am not soft, and if you desire to be my
friends, come back with me into the saloon and have a drink at my
expense."</p>

<p>Not a man held back. They were afraid to, perhaps. Or perhaps
there were so many of them that they were not ashamed. Because
crowds are usually devoid of all noble feeling, even of shame. They
went back with the tall man, and he himself went behind the bar and
served them, stepping over the body of the dead man that lay on the
floor, while he passed out glasses and bottles.</p>

<p>He drank with them most cheerfully, and they noted that he put
down the "red-eye" without blinking an eye and without a chaser.
They noticed, too, that he paid punctually for the drinks, leaving
a bright new gold piece shining upon the bar as he passed out.</p>

<p>The crowd remained behind to chat about this new wonder, to lift
the body of Mortimer and give him a dog's burial just as he had
died a dog's death.</p>

<p>In the street the tall man met the little tenderfoot. He smiled
down at little Sammy Gregg, and he found the steady, unshaken,
pale-blue eye of Sammy Gregg surveying him gravely.</p>

<p>"Does a man have to be like you to get on in this part of the
country?" asked Sammy.</p>

<p>"Not a bit," said Furness, "but it's a good thing to be able to
take care of yourself. Have you a gun?"</p>

<p>"I never fired a gun in my life."</p>

<p>"There's a store. You'd better go buy one, the first thing you
do."</p>

<p>Sammy Gregg shook his head. "I'm no good at a bluff," he said.
"If I wear a gun, it's a sign that I pretend that I can use it. But
I can't. And I never could afford the time to learn. I'm pressed
for time, you see."</p>

<p>The tall man did not smile. He began to regard the little man
more seriously.</p>

<p>"May I ask what your business is?" he said.</p>

<p>"I have no business," said Sammy, "except to make ten thousand
dollars in six months out here. Do you think it can be done?"</p>

<p>"That depends," said Furness.</p>

<p>"Honestly, I mean."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Furness, "that is another story! No, frankly, I'm
afraid that you can't."</p>

<p>The ferret gleam of eagerness came into the eyes of little Sammy
Gregg. "I think that I will, though," said he.</p>

<p>"Finding a gold mine, then?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't know what I'll find. All I want is an opportunity,
not a gold mine. And fellows like those," and he gestured toward
the bullet-cracked door of the saloon, "are liable to leave a whole
lot of opportunities lying around loose without anybody really
claiming them."</p>

<p>He added: "I ought to thank you, though, for getting me out of
that mess."</p>

<p>"Don't say a word about it," said the big man genially. "I was
fighting my own battle, and not yours. Affairs have come to such a
horrible point around here that a man has to take a killing on his
hands whenever he enters a new town, or very nearly that!"</p>

<p>He said this in rather a jesting tone, but still there was
something in his manner that made little Sammy open his eyes, and
he thought he knew now what he had only guessed in the bar-room,
that Mr. Furness was the veteran of a hundred hand-to-hand
encounters. And awe and dread filled Sammy, and with it, a certain
instinctive dislike.</p>

<p>Others were to feel that same dislike for Furness later on, but
Sammy was the first man to sense the danger and the evil in the big
fellow. He said goodby rather briskly and swung away down the
street.</p>

<p>Opportunity! To really and truly turn five thousand dollars into
fifteen in six months!</p>

<p>But one could not examine such country as this on foot. And
there must be horse and saddle procured at once. He went to the
store for the saddle and got a secondhand one, a badly worn and
tattered one.</p>

<p>"It won't give you none too comfortable a seat," the storekeeper
advised him frankly.</p>

<p>"I'm not looking for comfort," said Sammy Gregg. "Now, where can
I get a horse and what do I have to pay for it? I hear they have
ten-dollar horses out West?"</p>

<p>"Texas is what you mean," said the storekeeper. "But around here
they gobble up everything in the shape of a hoss for fifty dollars.
And, up at the Crumbock Mines they'll pay seventy-five!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. &mdash; SAMMY'S BIG
IDEA</h2>

<p class="first">That was enough for young Sammy Gregg. He was
looking for an opportunity, and here, it seemed, was one shoved
under his very nose.</p>

<p>Horses cost ten dollars in Texas, in Crumbock they cost
seventy-five. Ten from seventy-five left sixty-five dollars for
clear profit. Allow fifteen dollars a head for transportation, and
the profit was still fifty dollars a head. Very well. For the sake
of caution, suppose that he invested only half of his available
capital and turned twenty-five hundred dollars into horses. That
would give him two hundred and fifty head at ten dollars a head.
But fifty times two hundred and fifty was twelve thousand five
hundred dollars!</p>

<p>Twenty-five hundred more than the profit he needed and already
at hand! Fire began to burn in Sammy Gregg, but he masked it
carefully from his face.</p>

<p>"I should think," said he, "that a lot of people would be in the
business of buying Texas horses and selling them in the Crumbock
mining region."</p>

<p>"You would think that," nodded the storekeeper, "unless you
knowed."</p>

<p>"Knew what?"</p>

<p>"Knew what Texas mustangs is like, for one thing."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>The storekeeper closed his eyes in strained thought, as he
reached for a superlative. "Keeping hold of a herd of mustangs," he
said at last, "is like trying to keep hold of a handful of
quicksilver. The harder you try to hold it, the farther it spurts
away."</p>

<p>"They're wild, I suppose."</p>

<p>"You suppose, son, but I know. I've rode 'em, I've broke 'em;
and then they broke me!"</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"I got a hip smashed as flat as a pancake. That's one thing. My
ribs is mixed up worse'n a mess of eggs scrambled in a frying pan.
And my head is set on crooked. All from mixing too long with them
mustangs."</p>

<p>"But if one just herded them along?"</p>

<p>"Herded the devil!" said the storekeeper with a weary sigh. "I
herded six of them twenty miles, once. It took me a month!"</p>

<p>"A month!"</p>

<p>"And then I only delivered seven of the twenty."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" cried Sammy Gregg. "Did you lose the way?"</p>

<p>The storekeeper stared at him. "Lose my way traveling twenty
miles? Son, I ain't that kind of a gazoop. Not me! I pack a sort of
a compass in the back of my head. But lemme tell you about a
mustang, that everything that you want to do is just what the
mustang ain't got any idea of doing."</p>

<p>Sammy was amazed.</p>

<p>"They stampede," said the storekeeper, "from hell to breakfast
and back ag'in. That's their nature. Promiscuous and free and easy.
Where they want to be is always just over the edge of the sky away
from where you want 'em to be. You can write that down. Besides,
even if a herd was drove up here by good hoss hands like some of
them Mexicans are, still what chance would there be of it getting
safe to Crumbock."</p>

<p>"I can't see why not?"</p>

<p>"You're young, son, but I'll make you a little older in a
minute. Lemme tell you that this ain't no open level plain around
here."</p>

<p>"I can see that," said Sammy seriously.</p>

<p>"It's all gouged up and crisscrossed by gullies and canyons
every which way, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"And them gullies and ravines is all slithering with hoss
thieves, old son!"</p>

<p>"You don't mean it!" cried Sammy.</p>

<p>"Don't I, though?"</p>

<p>"But why doesn't the law&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The law is a thousand miles away, son! Didn't I lose eight head
of good hosses six weeks back?"</p>

<p>"And never could get a trace of 'em?"</p>

<p>"Trace of 'em? Sure I did! I brought four of 'em back!"</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" cried Sammy. "You knew the men who stole them
and didn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Didn't what? Try to chase them?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, with help."</p>

<p>"Where would you get the help? Besides, you chase these crooks
away into the hills, and they're plumb gone. You could hide twenty
thousand head in any square mile of them bad lands. And then after
you've got back home, somebody all unbeknownst sneaks up to your
window and puts a bullet into the small of your back.</p>

<p>"'Murder by men or man unknown,' says the jury.</p>

<p>"'Poor old Bill!' says my friends. 'He wouldn't let well enough
alone!'</p>

<p>"No, sir, the best way is to keep hands off of them thieves.
They's too many of them, and they got this advantage, they hang
together and work together, and the honest folks don't!"</p>

<p>"But suppose that one hired a strong guard to herd the mustangs
across the hill country?"</p>

<p>"Herd it across a hundred miles of mountains? A guard for a few
hundred mustangs? Son, you're talkin' mad! You'd need a whole
company of soldiers to watch every mustang, and even then you'd
come in with only the tail of your hoss in your hands. Them thieves
are that slick that they would steal your hoss right from under
your saddle and leave you ridin' along on a one-eyed maverick that
you never seen before!"</p>

<p>By this time Sammy began to wonder not that the price of horses
in Crumbock was seventy-five dollars a head, but that it was not a
hundred and seventy-five. He went off by himself and sat down for a
cigarette and a think.</p>

<p>"The first idea is as good as the last!" said Sammy to himself.
"As good as the last, most of the time! So lemme see what I can
make out of the horse idea!"</p>

<p>He turned it back and forth. In the first place, it was plain
that Mr. Storekeeper had exaggerated somewhat. According to him, a
man was a fool who tried to drive horses to Crumbock, and yet
horses were certainly there, great numbers of them. Some people,
then, were making money by sending live stock there. How did they
manage it? Simply by doing what his friend the storekeeper swore
could not be done&mdash;guarding their horses through the
mountains, and herding them successfully across the great Texas
plains.</p>

<p>What others could do, Sammy could do, if he only knew where to
hire the right men, the right Mexicans, if they were the best!</p>

<p>The thought of large profits will lead on like the thought of a
promised land. And so it was that they led Sammy. For two long
hours, with the map in his hands, he made his calculations.</p>

<p>Before that day ended, he was on board a train away from Munson,
and the next morning he had changed trains and was shooting in a
roundabout way toward the southland of cheap horses.</p>

<p>Six months to go when he left New York City. Five months and
three weeks when he left Munson. Could he make it? Yes, confidence
arose in Sammy as he computed the distance. A month, say, to gather
the herd. That left four months and a half. Then an
eight-hundred-mile drive. Suppose they journeyed only twenty miles
a day. Still, at the end of forty days they would be at their
destination.</p>

<p>It seemed simple. Allow a month for mistakes. Allow another
month for unknown bad luck. Still he would have time to get back in
Brooklyn under the wire of the six months with some twenty thousand
dollars weighing down his pocket!</p>

<p>He was in San Antone now. He spent five desperate days trying to
interview Mexican cow-punchers and getting no further than:</p>

<p>"Si, se&ntilde;or. Ma&ntilde;ana!"</p>

<p>Always, they would meet him tomorrow, but tomorrow, they did not
appear. What was wrong with him?</p>

<p>Finally, in a San Antone hotel, he confided his troubles to a
sharp-eyed man with a fighting face. A man too stern to be
trivial.</p>

<p>He said to Sammy: "You're bound for a losing game if you're
bound to drive horses to Crumbock. But if you want a man to handle
your herd, there's one now!" He pointed to a dark-faced man in a
corner of the room.</p>

<p>"He!" gasped Sammy. "He looks like the king of Mexico more than
like a cowpuncher."</p>

<p>"You go talk to him," said the stern-faced man. "And tell him
that I sent you. He's a crook and a scoundrel. He'll either rob you
or else he'll see that you don't get robbed. It's six of one and a
half a dozen of the other. If you can trust Manuel, you can put
your life in his hands with perfect safety. But if he decides to
trick you, well, as good be done by him as by a dozen others."</p>

<p>So thought Sammy and, sitting beside the handsome young Mexican,
he poured forth his plans and his desires, while Manuel, stiff with
gold-laced jacket and collar, listened smiling, and dreamed over
the idea, through a thin blue-brown cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>He said at last in good English, "I hire the right men&mdash;men
who can ride and who know horses. I buy the right horses for you. I
drive those horses to Crumbock. You pay me five hundred dollars.
But if I can't drive those horses to Crumbock, you don't pay me a
cent. Do you like this idea, se&ntilde;or?"</p>

<p>The thought of five hundred dollars in wages to a single man was
a staggering thought to Sammy Gregg. And yet, the more he pondered,
the more it seemed to him that this was his only solution for the
problem.</p>

<p>So he closed with Manuel on the moment, and went up to his room
and wrote out a careful contract and offered it to Manuel.</p>

<p>"Ah, no," said Manuel, still smiling through a mist of smoke. "I
do not wish it in written words. If I fail, so! But if I succeed
then I shall trust myself to get the money&mdash;not a piece of
paper!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; THE HERD</h2>

<p class="first">There was only one fault which Sammy was inclined
to find with Manuel. He was everything but swift in his motions and
in his appearance, but nevertheless he accomplished a great deal.
He spent three days sorting over his acquaintances until he picked
out a pair of villainous-looking rascals&mdash;in the eye of Sammy
Gregg&mdash;of the roughest peon class.</p>

<p>However, they could ride anything and anywhere. They could shoot
well and they were willing to obey orders from the mouth of Manuel.
Also, they knew horses.</p>

<p>After the assistants had been chosen, a central corral was
picked out and toward this, presently, Manuel and his men began to
drift horses by the score and by the fifty. It was all Manuel. Very
soon Sammy Gregg found that he might as well stop worrying and
simply submit to the thorough management of Manuel, who went
straight ahead doing what he wanted to do, and if Sammy made
suggestions, Manuel received them, always, with a beautiful smile
that showed his flashing white teeth. That smile might have meant
anything, but before Sammy was through with his Mexican, he knew
that it meant: "You are a fool and all of your ideas are worthy of
a child only!"</p>

<p>This did not trouble Sammy. He was not interested in the scorn
of Manuel. He was only interested in the speed with which he
gathered horses.</p>

<p>What horses they were! At first, when he saw a section of the
brutes driven in, Sammy threw up his hands in despair and asked
Manuel if it were not a joke. Manuel assured him that these were
selected animals. Selected from what?</p>

<p>Lump-headed, roach-backed, thick-legged, pot-bellied creatures
were these, with Roman noses and little wicked eyes that glared
tigerishly out from beneath a shag of forelock. One could believe
nothing about them, at first glance, except tales of evil temper.
But when Manuel saw that his boss had no opinion at all of the
purchase, he simply had the most tractable of the lot saddled and
gave it to his boss to ride. Although Sammy had already learned to
ride, he spent three days struggling with this "well broken"
animal; but after that his eyes were opened.</p>

<p>He discovered that the ugly little monster could rock along all
day at an easy canter which ate up mileage as swiftly as the gallop
of a wolf. The bronco could stop in his own length while going at
full speed, turn his body faster than a man could turn his head,
and be off in a new direction. He found that the body of the
mustang was like his temperas tough as rawhide, than which there is
nothing tougher.</p>

<p>He discovered, too, that there was no gentling these creatures.
They remained to the end enslaved barbarians always hungering for
the moment when they could plant their heels in the stomach of the
master and then knead his body soft and small with their sharp
hooves while he lay on the ground.</p>

<p>These were the animals which Manuel and his two assistants
collected, but not at ten dollars a head. The price had risen. It
was almost a twelve-dollar average which Sammy had to pay, so he
contented himself with a herd of two hundred, and with these he
started out with the three cow-punchers on the long trek north
toward the mountains.</p>

<p>They had luck enough across the great Texas plains. For mishaps
they had half a dozen stampedes which lost thirty horses and cost
them altogether a good additional three hundred miles of going. But
by the time they got to the hills, the herd was in fairly good
shape for traveling. The running edge had been taken out of their
temper, and they had learned to troop along obediently enough.
Manuel had turned out to be the king of the herdsmen, and his two
assistants were masters of the same work&mdash;delicate, delicate
work indeed.</p>

<p>Whoever has ridden herd on a bunch of wild mustangs knows that
above the mind of the brute there is the mind of the whole mass of
animals, blind and deaf and enormous, and sensitive. Ready to
stampede straight over the face of a cliff at a moment's notice; or
just as ready to trample down a town.</p>

<p>Sammy had come to be of a little use before the trail was ended.
And he was even trusted with the dangerous work of riding night
herd on the horses, which is that portion of the work that requires
the most skill.</p>

<p>By this time they were looking forward to the end of their
trail. Munson was a scant march of thirty miles away. Beyond Munson
was another hundred miles of mountains, and then the end of their
labors! So that Sammy, from time to time during the day, could not
help letting his thoughts run ahead of him. A hundred and seventy
horses at seventy-five dollars a head made twelve thousand, seven
hundred and fifty dollars.</p>

<p>Just enough, just enough. And so to return to his Susie Mitchell
not in six months, but in two. He would appear before her startled
eyes like a hero indeed. He would be invested with a veil of glory;
yes, even in his own eyes!</p>

<p>They had bedded down the herd in a sort of natural corral. It
was as though some great hand had scooped a basin among the hills.
There was a broad, flat-bottomed meadow in the midst, and around
the sides, half a dozen throats of canyons yawned black upon the
little amphitheater.</p>

<p>They could not have found a more ideal location, and to make
perfection a gilded wonder, there was a little shallow stream of
water, glimmering in the starlight as it trickled musically along
over a bed of hard gravel. No danger of broken legs on steep banks,
no danger of horses bogged down in quicksands here!</p>

<p>"We won't even need to ride herd tonight," suggested Sammy
Gregg. "This place is so made to order!"</p>

<p>"Ah, se&ntilde;or," murmured Manuel, "you are full of trust.
Perhaps it is well in some places, but not here. Here, even the
mountains are watching you and hating you, se&ntilde;or!"</p>

<p>That was a sentence which young Sammy Gregg did not forget. And,
that night, he himself prepared for riding herd as a token that he
was willing to take advice. But Manuel was also in the saddle.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Sammy Gregg. "Surely at the worst, one man is
enough here!"</p>

<p>"If they should shoot off toward one of those canyons
they&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They are not as restless now as they used to be."</p>

<p>"They are always restless in their hearts, no matter how tired
and how quiet their bodies may be!"</p>

<p>Before that night was over, Sammy had to agree with his hired
man. A nervous devil seemed to have possessed the herd. Once, at
the hoot of an owl, every one of the beasts started to its feet.
There they stood poised, as you might say, and ready for
everything. But the voices of the men soothed them.</p>

<p>They rode clockwise and counter-clockwise around the edges of
the herd, and their voices were never still, talking, talking, or
singing softly all night long&mdash;a weary work. And, at length,
the herd sank down again on the ground, as though at another
signal.</p>

<p>When Sammy reached Manuel at the next circle of the herd, he
paused to ask: "What could have made them jump up at the same
minute?"</p>

<p>"There is something in the air, tonight," said Manuel. "You and
I cannot tell, but the broncos certainly can tell."</p>

<p>For his part, Sammy was willing to believe. He had seen enough
of these wild little animals to begin to have an uncanny respect
for them. In a way, they seemed to be as full of wisdom as they
were filled with meanness. So he rode on in his work, still
singing&mdash;it did not matter what, so long as the song was soft.
As he passed, the pricked ears of the prone horses would flatten in
recognition of the human voice which they hated, but which
nevertheless reassured them.</p>

<p>Give a horse something to occupy his mind and you can do
anything with him. If it is only a bit to chew on and chomp and
worry while you are giving a colt his lesson. But don't try to
occupy the whole attention of a dumb beast with your teaching.
Sammy was beginning to understand this, too.</p>

<p>After all, there was something charming about this scene. He had
a vague wish that Susie Mitchell might be riding by his side, here,
looking at the black, gaunt, treeless hills; or watching the faint
shine of the running water, with the lumpy forms of prone horses
dimly silhouetted against it here and there, and always the broad,
bright beauty of the stars overhead. The alkali scents and
sharpness was taken from the air, now that it was night. The wind
was cool, almost cold. It touched the hands and flowed across the
face like running water. It brought peace to the heart of Sammy
Gregg.</p>

<p>Day was not far off, now. There was no coming of light, but
there was a change in the air, which Sammy was beginning to know as
the forerunner of the sunrise. Just when he told himself, with
relief, that there would be only another hour of darkness to watch
through, the two hundred leaped suddenly to their feet again.</p>

<p>There had not been a sound this time, not even the hoot of an
owl, and yet here were the horses bolt upright, heads raised, and
all turned toward the west where the black mouth of one of the
canyons yawned wide upon the meadowland. Out of that canyon, at
last, Sammy heard a noise like a far-off clapping of hands. Then he
heard a thin sound of a horse neighing, and after that, five horses
shot out of the blackness into the light of the stars, five horses
with a man on every back, and the crashing of the flying hoofbeats
rang and echoed in the ears of Sammy.</p>

<p>The thieves, the horse thieves of whom Manuel had spoken so
often, of whom the storekeeper had warned him!</p>

<p>There was a shrill, universal squealing that broke from the
herd. Then they whirled and fled at lightning speed from this
sudden horror which had leaped out of the heart of the dark night.
They ran with heads stretched forward, ears flattened, tails
streaming straight out behind them&mdash;they ran blind with speed.
And, in an instant the meadow was swept as bare as the palm of
Sammy's hand. And, on the heels of his disappearing herd, five
riders were spurring along, not mounted on broncos, but upon tall,
long-legged blood horses which sprang across the ground with a
tigerish grace and swiftness.</p>

<p>Sammy himself spurred wildly in pursuit. Up to his lips rose a
harsh cry, such a sound as he had never uttered before. Here was
Manuel close beside him, his teeth glinting, but not in a smile.
Sammy reached across and tore a Colt from the saddle halter nearest
to him. Another weapon gleamed and spoke from the hand of
Manuel.</p>

<p>For answer, there was a blasting volley from the scurrying
shadows far up in the ravine, first the brief, wicked humming of
bullets, wasplike, in the air about the ears of Sammy, and, after
that, a rattling of long echo above the thunder of the flying
herd.</p>

<p>But what was that to Sammy?</p>

<p>They had missed him. He felt that he had a charmed life, that it
would be given him to ride through a steady rain of bullets until
he came up with these villains, these robbers. He raised his Colt
and with the heavy weapon wabbling in his weak, untrained hand, he
fired, and again and again.</p>

<p>There was no more shooting from the riders before him. No, they
were drawing farther away at every moment, and now they rushed
around a corner of the ravine and were beyond his sight. But what
was this beside him? A riderless horse&mdash;the horse of
Manuel!</p>

<p>The madness was brushed from the mind of Sammy Gregg, and
suddenly he saw himself as he was, a foolish child riding down on a
band of five practiced warriors of the frontier, warriors as
cunning and as merciless as Indians, if indeed they were not
Indians. Here in this fight in which poor Manuel had fallen
already, how could he, a tenderfoot, hope to succeed? He drew
rein.</p>

<p>And Manuel?</p>

<p>He galloped back as fast as he could and he found that Manuel's
two Mexican friends were already at the spot. It occurred to the
bitter heart of poor Sammy that these fellows might have been
riding on the trail of the thieves rather than waste their time
here. But no, they squatted beside Manuel, not in any agony of
grief, but calmly smoking their cigarettes. Manuel himself had his
head pillowed upon a rock, and he was trying to smoke, but his
fingers were thick with numbness, and the cigarette kept falling
from his hand.</p>

<p>He greeted his employer with a flash of his eyes.</p>

<p>"Why do they try to do nothing for you, Manuel?" gasped Sammy.
"Where is the wound?"</p>

<p>There was so little breath in Manuel that he had to collect it
through a long and deadly pause before he could answer: "I am shot
through beneath the heart. I have not long to live,
se&ntilde;or."</p>

<p>"A bandage."</p>

<p>There was a slight motion of the hand of Manuel. It denied all
aid. It mocked at the possibility of assistance.</p>

<p>"Nothing can be done, se&ntilde;or. Only, to make me sleep more
easily, if one of them can be found, and sent where I am going, it
would be a great comfort to me, se&ntilde;or. It is a place where
one needs company, eh?"</p>

<p>He began to laugh, but the laughter died off into a weirdly
bubbling noise, and Manuel stiffened himself, and died.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. &mdash; STOLEN
HORSES</h2>

<p class="first">When Sammy Gregg had seen to the burial of poor
Manuel and then suggested to the two remaining Mexicans to begin a
pursuit of the thieves, the latter merely shrugged their shoulders
and held out their hands for their pay. They declared that one dead
man was enough and that the two of them were not prepared to fight
with five who were as well armed and shot as straight as did these
thieves.</p>

<p>After all, they had a good deal of reason on their side,
particularly since Sammy himself would not be of much use in a
battle. So he paid them in haste and then mounted and rode as hard
as he could pelt for the town of Munson.</p>

<p>He was glad of one thing, and that was that the flight of the
thieves with their stolen horses had been in the same direction.
They had driven on toward the very spot from which he would receive
his succor!</p>

<p>Indeed, they kept on that straight way until they were a scant
ten miles from the town, and then the track of the herd diverged
and turned to the left up a branching canyon. And Sammy Gregg
pushed on and on. And by the mid-morning his foaming, staggering
horse came into Munson town, with Sammy shouting from the saddle
the news of his loss.</p>

<p>When they heard him, people ran out of shops and houses and
listened, but when they understood the news that he brought, they
shrugged their shoulders and turned back. Sammy began to see more
backs than faces, and those who did turn toward him were, most of
them, plainly laughing at him in his distress.</p>

<p>Suddenly Sammy understood. They smiled at him because they
simply did not care, these hard-hearted fellows. They did not care
for the hundred and seventy mustangs which he had bought at such an
expense, and which he had driven with labor and money both, into
the mountains so near to his market place. What was it to them that
the savings of ten years were represented in this holocaust? They
merely shrugged their shoulders and were glad that the loss had not
fallen upon them.</p>

<p>He went into Rendell's store and sat down on top of a barrel of
dried apples and dropped his chin on his fist and stared at the
dust cloud that trailed down the street behind a passing horseman,
and wondered at the brilliancy of the sun as it flashed and burned
and turned that fine dust into powdered diamonds. Rendell, even,
did not offer sympathy. However, neither did he say: "I told you
so!"</p>

<p>He merely said: "Are you downhearted, kid?"</p>

<p>"No," said Sammy truthfully. "But I'm surprised. That's all.
They don't seem to care, you see, these people don't seem to
care!"</p>

<p>"Not their horses that were stole," Rendell pointed out.</p>

<p>"Yes," explained Sammy, "but if they let these things happen,
their horses will be stolen next, you see. And they'll suffer
because I've suffered. Don't they see that the only thing is to
stand together and fight the thieves off?"</p>

<p>Rendell shook his head. "Maybe about half of them would sort of
like to be thieves themselves," he said.</p>

<p>That afforded a ray of dazzling light to Sammy, and he gaped at
the genial storekeeper.</p>

<p>"Sure," expanded Rendell, "you can't trust nobody. Nobody that
likes a quiet life is up here, and you can depend upon that!
Everybody you meet might be a crook. I might be a crook. You never
can tell!"</p>

<p>He added: "Some is made to understand these here things and
prosper pretty good around here in the West. And some ain't made to
understand these things, and then they'd better go back to where
they got a cop on every corner to watch out that the law is
obeyed."</p>

<p>The hint was very pointed. But Sammy was really not frightened.
He simply said: "I know what you mean. But they haven't taken the
heart out of me yet. I got something left. Only I didn't know how
they played the game. That's all! Now I'm beginning to understand,
and maybe I'll find a way to fit in with this sort of thing."</p>

<p>He went out into the street, and the first thing he heard was
the sharp whistling of a flute around the corner. He turned that
corner and found a slender youth sitting on a broken apple box,
with his back against the wall of the saloon that had once been run
by Mortimer. He had the flute at his lips, and with eyes half
closed either from laziness or from love of the music which he was
making, he blew forth sweet showers of sound.</p>

<p>He was dressed in what might have been called splendid rags. For
his shirt was silk and so was his bandanna, and his boots were
adorned with beautifully long-arched spurs, and the boots
themselves, battered and tattered as they were, had evidently once
been shopmade goods. The sombrero itself, which lay upon the ground
to receive any random coins which the passers-by chose to drop into
it, was now merely a relic of a former glory, for around the crown
young Sammy Gregg could see a shadowy network which had once, no
doubt, been left as an impression there by interlacing
metal-work&mdash;silver or gold.</p>

<p>He was a brown-eyed boy, this player of the flute, a handsome,
lazy-looking, sleek-looking fellow; and the more Sammy looked upon
him, the more he seemed worth beholding. For it seemed to Sammy, as
he stared, that for the first time in his life he was looking upon
a man who had never felt the sting of the universal curse of Adam.
He had never worked!</p>

<p>Aye, that accounted for the girlish smoothness of that cheek,
the brow as clear and as placid as standing water, the eye so
calmly open that one could look a thousand fathoms deep into it, as
into the eye of a very young and simple child.</p>

<p>Yet he was not simple, either, this player of the flute. And
indeed, the more Sammy looked upon him, the more he felt that he
was beholding a unique character.</p>

<p>Not so the others in Munson. They were too filled with their own
affairs. Besides, the music was not to their taste. It consisted
chiefly of wild improvisations, swift and light and eerie playings
of the fancy; and there were none of the downright jigging tunes
which the rough fellows of the mountains were apt to like, swelling
the beat of the rhythm by the heavy beating of their heels.</p>

<p>They shook their heads at the more refined music which the young
stranger made. It annoyed them, more than anything else. And the
only money which the labors of the stranger had gained were a few
coppers and a few small silver coins. It seemed to Sammy that there
was enough to this young man to be worth a more liberal reward, and
so he stepped closer and dropped the broad bright face of a
ten-dollar gold piece into the hat.</p>

<p>The flute player picked the coin from his hat, rose to his feet,
bowed slowly and with much grace to Sammy, placed the hat on his
head, the flute under his arm, and sauntered deliberately off down
the street with the laziest step that Sammy had ever remarked in a
human being, a stride in which he rested with every step!</p>

<p>And that was all that Sammy's ten dollars had bought him, in
place of the interesting conversation which, he was sure, might be
made to flow from the lips of the boy as readily as the music had
come.</p>

<p>Sammy had lunch at the hotel, and he was wandering back down the
street to the door of Rendell's store, in fact, when he saw a thing
which made his heart leap. Straight down the street toward him came
half a dozen tired mustangs driven along by a tall, wild-appearing
fellow with long, sandy mustaches.</p>

<p>He, however, was not the chief object of interest to Sammy. His
horses were what held Sammy's attention; the instant he glanced at
them he knew them. They were a fragment of his newly stolen
herd!</p>

<p>He could not be mistaken. At first, each of the hundred and
seventy had looked very much like one another. But afterward he had
begun to see the distinctions as he rode with them day and night.
And now he knew them all. He knew that Roman-nosed roan. He knew
very well that blaze-faced brown and the chestnut with the broken
ear. He knew all six of them, he could swear to them! And the
papers of sale were in his pocket!</p>

<p>He started into the store and called to Rendell: "Here come six
of them with one of the thieves behind!"</p>

<p>Rendell ran to the door.</p>

<p>"No," said he, "that's not one of the thieves, any more than I
am. That's one of the oldest ranchmen around these parts. It's
Cumnor, son; and he's no thief. Look yonder&mdash;they got new
brands burned into their shoulders. No, sir, you can depend upon it
that Cumnor bought those bosses honest."</p>

<p>"What bills of sale did he get with them?" asked Sammy.</p>

<p>"Bills of sale?" asked the storekeeper, opening his eyes as
though at some strange new star that had swum into the heavens.
"Bills of sale?" Then he added with a rather wicked grin: "Maybe
you'll ask him what bills of sale he's got, and he'll show 'em to
you!"</p>

<p>The troop of horses was already opposite the doors of the store.
And Cumnor was waving a buckskin-shod hand in greeting to Rendell,
when Sammy ran down the steps. And, in another moment, Sammy was
standing at the head of Cumnor's pony.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cumnor," he said abruptly, "these six horses were stolen
from me this morning!"</p>

<p>"Son," said Mr. Cumnor, "doggone me if that ain't interesting to
me!"</p>

<p>There seemed to be a touch of dry humor about this, but Sammy
Gregg was not in a humor to enjoy such wit. He said: "I have the
bills of sale, with the register of the brands, and all!"</p>

<p>"You have?"echoed Mr. Cumnor, frowning a little.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Sammy, "but the thief must have taken you
in!"</p>

<p>"You're sorry?" echoed Cumnor.</p>

<p>"Sorry that you've lost your money!"</p>

<p>"Look here," said Cumnor. "I paid fifty dollars spot cash for
each of them six, and I had all the trouble, too, of picking 'em
out of a big herd. Now what do you think I'm gonna do about
it?"</p>

<p>Sammy shrugged his shoulders as he had seen others do that day.
"I'm sorry," he repeated, "but if you want to see my documents,
here!"</p>

<p>He reached for an inside pocket, but before his hand got to it,
a long Colt was in the hand of Mr. Cumnor and the muzzle yawned
terribly just before the face of Sammy Gregg. It seemed, indeed,
that Mr. Cumnor had gravely mistaken the gesture of Sammy
Gregg!</p>

<p>"Now, look here," said Cumnor, "I ain't aiming to have any more
trouble with you than I can help. But I ain't got any care to see
your papers. The papers that I'm interested in is the gold coins
that I paid for the six horses that stand here. And, outside of
that, I bought them six horses from a gentleman that I would trust
pretty complete."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me his name?" asked Sammy.</p>

<p>"His name is one that's pretty well known around here in the
past few months. Maybe even you have heard of Chester O. Furness,
young stranger?"</p>

<p>Sammy gasped and then he shouted: "But I tell you, if that's his
name and he sold you those horses, then Chester Ormonde Furness is
one of the five thieves who ran off my horses this morning!"</p>

<p>Mr. Cumnor lowered his revolver just a trifle. "I'm sort of busy
today," said he.</p>

<p>"Ride on," said Sammy. "I'll herd the horses away!"</p>

<p>"You'll what?" said Cumnor. "Keep off of them six, son!"</p>

<p>"Cumnor," said Sammy Gregg, facing the big man without fear,
though he saw that danger was before him, "I offer to prove my
right to them, one by one!"</p>

<p>"I ain't got time to listen. You find Furness and talk to him,
first of all! Now stand out of my way."</p>

<p>Oaths were rare upon the lips of Sammy, but now he cried out:
"I'll see you damned before I stand away!"</p>

<p>"Then take it, you fool!" snapped Cumnor, and fired his pistol
full in the face of Sammy Gregg.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. NO LAW</h2>

<p class="first">Rendell heard the shot fired and saw Sammy fall;
and the big storekeeper came hobbling down the steps in haste,
moving himself sidewise on account of his stiffened, ruined hip.
And yet he had agility and strength enough left in his body to lean
and lift poor Sammy in his arms. He carried him to the porch of the
store and laid him out in the shade. All one side of Sammy's head
was running blood, and big Rendell made no effort to bind the wound
or examine it. Death seemed only too certain.</p>

<p>But he busied himself fumbling through the pockets of Gregg, and
at length he stood up with an oath and turned upon Cumnor, who sat
his saddle sullenly nearby, keeping one gloomy eye upon the
disappearing mustangs down the street as though he wanted very much
to ride after them, and yet not daring for shame to ride away from
his victim so soon.</p>

<p>Such a hasty flight might well turn self-defense into murder,
even in the lenient eye of the public opinion of Munson. "D'you
know that he didn't carry no gun, d'you know that, Cumnor?" asked
Rendell.</p>

<p>"How should I know that?" growled Cumnor.</p>

<p>"By the look of him, for one thing, I should say," said the
storekeeper. "The devil, man, you ain't blind!"</p>

<p>"I ain't no mind reader, though," said Cumnor.</p>

<p>"D'you need to read minds to see that he ain't a wild fighting
type?"</p>

<p>"He was talking pretty big," rumbled Cumnor.</p>

<p>"He was talking for his rights," said Rendell. "And nothing
more'n his rights."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Cumnor. "Who made you the judge and the
sheriff in this here county?"</p>

<p>"Why," cried Rendell, "if it comes right down to that, I'm due
to prove that I can handle myself as well as though I was a judge
and a jury. I may of busted up my ribs and my hip, Cumnor, but
darned if my gun fingers and my gun wrist ain't about as supple as
they ever was."</p>

<p>But Mr. Rendell had built up a not inconsiderable reputation in
the days before he retired to the quiet of his store, and Cumnor
was in no haste to see the storekeeper make his threat good. So the
rancher was extremely pleased to see an opportunity to make a
change of conversation, and pointing past the other he said:
"What's all the shoutin' for, Rendell? Are you talkin' about a dead
man or one that's only been scratched a mite and taught a
lesson?"</p>

<p>Rendell whirled about and saw Sammy Gregg, with a hand laid
against the side of his head, propping himself up on the other
arm.</p>

<p>Instantly the big fellow was at work examining and dressing the
head wound, and Cumnor, glad to be away from this place, spurred
off to look after his mustangs so recently purchased. He had barely
veered around the corner at the farther end of the street when who
should he see before him but the tall form and the handsome face of
Chester Ormonde Furness, mounted upon a magnificent, dappled-gray
horse, a gelding with a stallion's wild eye and crested neck.</p>

<p>The heat of the recent scene was still in Cumnor, or perhaps he
would not have ventured as much as he did, for the men of that
region had not forgotten and were not likely ever to forget how Mr.
Furness had burned his name in the bar at Mortimer's saloon.
Cumnor, however, was in the humor for a hasty action at this
instant, and he reined his horse abruptly in front of Furness.</p>

<p>"Furness," he sang out, "when you sold me those six horses an
hour ago, did you know that I was buying trouble with them,
too?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said Furness, "I have no idea what you're
talking about, I'm sure. Except that I know you got the pick of the
herd. You paid fifty dollars a head for horses that might have
brought sixty-five in any market about here."</p>

<p>"Aye, and suppose that I was to ask you for a bill of
sale&mdash;and the records of the transfers of those horses,
Furness."</p>

<p>"Records?" echoed Furness, frowning like one in pain. "Why,
Cumnor, the word of the man from whom I bought those animals
wholesale was enough for me, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"What man?" snapped Cumnor. "What man did you buy them from, I'd
like to know?"</p>

<p>Mr. Furness grew exceedingly cold. And he straightened himself
in the saddle. Upon his hip he rested his ungloved right hand. A
very odd thing about Mr. Furness was that though he never rode
forth without his gloves, yet he was rarely or never seen to wear
leather upon that supple right hand. Indeed, constant exposure had
covered it with a very handsome bronze that made his well-kept
finger nails look almost snowy white in contrast.</p>

<p>And he said to the rancher: "I trust that I don't understand
you, Cumnor."</p>

<p>"The devil," said Cumnor. "I'm talking English, ain't I?"</p>

<p>Then Cumnor saw that the deadly right hand of Furness was
resting on his right hip&mdash;resting there lightly, as though
poised for further movement.</p>

<p>Mr. Cumnor regretted with all his heart that he had been so
extremely hasty in making remarks upon the financial principles of
Furness. The latter was saying, coldly: "Really, Cumnor, this is
extraordinary. I don't know that I can tolerate this even from you,
my dear Cumnor!"</p>

<p>Mr. Cumnor saw that he had come to a point in which it was far
better to walk backward than to continue straight ahead, and he
remarked gravely: "I think that if you ride down the street, you'll
find a man at the store of Rendell with a bullet wound in his head.
I wish that you'd ride down there and hear that fellow talk!"</p>

<p>He said no more about sale records and deeds of transfer, but he
reined his horse to the side again, and spurred away in the pursuit
of the six mustangs. Mr. Furness cantered his big gray gelding down
the street to the store of Rendell and dismounted there and looked
into the store.</p>

<p>What he saw was young Sammy Gregg leaning against the counter
with a very white face, a face almost as white as the bandage which
was tied around his head. And the color of face and bandage was set
off by a spreading spot of crimson that was soaking through the
cloth.</p>

<p>"How are you now, kid?" Rendell was asking.</p>

<p>"I'll do fine," said Sammy Gregg. "Ah, there's a man that I want
to talk to." He started up and confronted big Furness.</p>

<p>"Furness," he said, "I had nearly two hundred head of horses
stolen from me this morning. Five men did the trick. They killed my
chief helper, and they scared two more of them nearly to death.
I've seen six of those horses that were stolen. No doubt about
them. I know them as well as I know my own hand. On account of
those horses I've just been shot down. Well, Cumnor did the
shooting, and Cumnor says that he bought those horses from
you!"</p>

<p>Mr. Furness bit his lip and then drew in his breath with a sound
which was very much like the moan of wind through thin branches. He
sat down upon a stool and he removed his hat and mopped his
forehead.</p>

<p>"Stolen horses! Good Lord!" said Mr. Furness. "No wonder the
scoundrels were willing to sell those horses to me for twenty-five
dollars apiece!"</p>

<p>"Was that what they asked?"</p>

<p>"That's it. Twenty-five dollars. And of course I knew that
almost anything decent in the line of a horse will sell for fifty
dollars a head! I saw a quick profit. Heavens, youngster, it never
came into my head that the horses might be stolen. You see, I'm
almost as much of a greenhorn around here as you are! I paid cash
for the horses and landed the whole lot of them."</p>

<p>"I suppose that I ought to be sorry for you, then," said Sammy.
"Because I'm afraid that I'll have to claim the entire lot of
them!"</p>

<p>"I wish you luck," said Furness. "I wish you luck, upon my soul
of honor. But I'm afraid that you'll have to do a tall bit of
scrambling for them! Not thirty minutes ago three horse traders who
were bound north came up with me and looked the lot over and they
offered me forty dollars a head spot cash. The profit was too good
to be true. A quick turnover better than a long deal, you know. I
took that money and they split the herd into three chunks and
rattled them off through the canyons to the north."</p>

<p>Mr. Gregg clutched his hands together. "North! Aye, north!" he
said. "They're bound for Crumbock and seventy-five dollars a
head!"</p>

<p>"Eighty dollars, my friend," put in the gentle voice of Mr.
Furness. "The price is going up at Crumbock."</p>

<p>Mr. Gregg groaned. "Will you tell me what the five thieves
looked like?"</p>

<p>"There were only two that I saw anything of."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"They were very well mounted, for one thing."</p>

<p>"Not on mustangs?"</p>

<p>"No, there was a lot of hot blood in the horses they were
riding. Long- legged steppers, they were!"</p>

<p>"I saw them and I watched them move," sighed Sammy. "Yes,
they're fast! But what of the two men?"</p>

<p>"I could pick them out from any crowd for you, Gregg," said the
big fellow, "and I should be delighted to do so. Delighted! One was
rather young; the other middle-aged. Both Mexicans. The older
fellow has a pair of scars that look like knife-work on his right
cheek. He must have had a passage with some left-handed man!</p>

<p>"The younger chap is distinguished for a very long chin and an
overshot lower jaw. Unmistakable, both of them! We'll get up some
posters to spot them, you might offer a reward. Yes, by Jove, I'll
put myself down for a hundred on that same reward! I want to help
you out, Gregg. I sympathize with you, my friend!"</p>

<p>And he stood up and clapped a kindly hand upon the shoulder of
the smaller man and then turned to leave the store. He had reached
the door before Sammy had the courage to cry out: "Just one minute,
Mr. Furness."</p>

<p>The big man turned with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>"You see," said Sammy, "a man can't keep the proceeds from the
sale of stolen goods."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," said Furness.</p>

<p>"I mean, Furness," insisted Sammy, "that the money that was paid
to you for those horses really belongs in my pocket!"</p>

<p>Mr. Furness laughed, but without much conviction. "I see that
you're a wit," said he. "But after all, that's rather a queer
joke!"</p>

<p>He stepped away from the door of the store, and his whistle came
blithely back to them. Sammy, with an exclamation, started to run
in pursuit, but the quick hand of the storekeeper caught him and
held him back.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. &mdash; RENDELL'S
ADVICE</h2>

<p class="first">It seemed to Sammy, for a blinding instant of
wrath, that even big, good-natured Rendell had joined in the
conspiracy to drive him mad with persecution. But one glance at the
frowning, unhappy face of the cripple convinced him.</p>

<p>"Don't you see, kid?" said Rendell. "It's no good! No good at
all! It's Furness&mdash;that's all there is to it."</p>

<p>"Furness? But Furness simply doesn't understand the law on that
point, and he doesn't see that the law will really restore to
me"</p>

<p>"Furness understands everything," said Mr. Rendell. "I always
knew that from the minute I laid eyes on him. I knew that he
understood everything. But I never quite got onto his dodge. I
didn't see what side of the fence he was on. But today I see, and I
see it mighty plain!"</p>

<p>"What, Rendell?"</p>

<p>"Look here, kid. If you run after Furness and stop him with your
talk, d'you know that you'll only collect another chunk of lead?
Except that Cumnor missed, but Furness ain't the kind that
misses!"</p>

<p>"You mean he's crooked?"</p>

<p>"He is. But smooth. Crooked as a snake and softer and smoother
than a snake. That's all the difference there is between 'em."</p>

<p>"Furness? Why, Rendell, I've seen him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kill Mortimer and run that cur Lawson out of town. Yes, but a
crook can be a brave man, you know! I say, Gregg, that you'll never
get a penny out of Mr. Furness."</p>

<p>"I remember, now," said Sammy gloomily, "that when he tried to
laugh, there was no ring to it at all. No ring at all! But it don't
seem possible that he's a crook! Nobody could suspect it!"</p>

<p>"Not until I begin to let the news of this drift around the
country. Then there'll be a little change in the feeling about Mr.
Furness. But you, kid, what are you gonna do?"</p>

<p>"I'm going back," said Sammy gravely.</p>

<p>"Back to Brooklyn? You're wise, at that. This sort of a country
ain't made for your kind!"</p>

<p>"Back to Brooklyn? No, sir, I'm going south and buy me another
herd."</p>

<p>"Not again!"</p>

<p>"I've got a shade more than two thousand left. And that's enough
to get what I need. I got within a hundred miles of Crumbock last
time, nearly. This time I may win all the way through!"</p>

<p>Mr. Rendell was more than impressed. He was frankly amazed and
admiring, and he said so at once. Because it was no more his nature
to disguise admiration than it was to disguise disapproval.</p>

<p>"Why," said he, "you're a bulldog, son! With twenty more pounds
of beef on you, you'd be at the throat of this here Furness, I got
an idea! Going south for more hosses! Why, doggone me, kid, you'll
be taking them wet, I suppose, this trip!"</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" asked the innocent Sammy.</p>

<p>"Taking them with no papers at all. Taking them just the way
they're drove up out of the Rio Grande. Wet! That's all!"</p>

<p>Sammy was interested. He wanted more information and he got
it.</p>

<p>"I'm the fountainhead for all the talk you want about the border
crooks," said Rendell. "I used to work and run hosses in them
ranges. And that's where I was used up. Up here, maybe you think
that some of the boys is a mite rough. But they ain't rough enough
to be called men, even, down in my home country. They'd use these
here bloomin' heroes for roustabouts, and don't you forget it. Why,
when I come up here I found that they figured on me for a man, even
when I was only no more than a cripple. Well, down yonder on the
border they didn't think shucks of me. Not a bit! They used me up
so bad that I had to move out.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, down yonder they're all fire-eaters. But right along
the river itself is the worst land of all. That's the place where
the boys go that ain't got any home. The boys that need more
freedom than they can get in this here, free country. There's
districts down there where they draw a dead line that no sheriff is
allowed to pass. And the minute a deputy or a sheriff shows up,
anybody is free to pull guns and start blazing away.</p>

<p>"Down in them parts they go in for the hoss business pretty
frequent. Mostly it ain't Texas mustangs that they're after, but
Mexican devils dressed up in the hides of hosses. Them boys just
ride out in a party twenty strong and they spot a place that's
famous in North Mexico for having a good set of ponies, and they
kill the greasers that are riding herd, and round up the hossflesh
and slide it off toward the river.</p>

<p>"Them that want to buy hosses, and good hosses and buy 'em
cheap, goes down to the bad lands, there, and buys 'em up mighty
reasonable. I've knowed three-dollar hosses from them parts that
looked a pile better than any of them fifty-dollar hosses that
Cumnor got today.</p>

<p>"But when you buy them hosses, you buy 'em pretty cheap, but you
don't get no papers, I don't have to tell you. You take your
chances. And the first gent that comes along and takes a fancy to
your herd, he can cotton onto them hosses of yours, if he's able to
lick you. And you can't complain to no sheriff because you can't
prove that them hosses really belonged to you by rights.</p>

<p>"Besides, after you've drove them hosses five hundred miles into
the country, they're liable to stampede and run all the way back to
their own pasture lands on the south side of the river, and then
you got a thousand miles extra to ride and considerable hunting to
do after you arrive."</p>

<p>Such was the story of "wet" horses and cheap ones which Rendell
told to Sammy Gregg, but Gregg listened with the fire in his eyes
once more. The morals of the matter did not trouble him. If it were
wrong to buy stolen horses, Sammy did not pause to so much as
consider the subject. He had had a herd of horses stolen from him.
Therefore the world owed him another supply. It made very little
difference where he got them so long as he was not the actual
thief.</p>

<p>Five-dollar horses!</p>

<p>He went to sleep to dream of them that night, and the next
morning he was on the train once more and headed for the southland.
Poor Sammy Gregg, bound for the land where men were "really bad!"
But perhaps you begin to feel that Sammy deserved something more
than pity. And I think he did. The storekeeper was right. There was
a great deal of the bulldog in Gregg; and there was fire, too, fire
that would not burn out!</p>

<p>After he arrived, he spent a week or more learning what he could
of the best district which he could head toward on the river. He
learned that. He found a bank to which he could intrust his money,
and then he set out to see the sights of that frontier town. He saw
enough, too, but the thing that filled him with the greatest marvel
was the second glimpse he had of his flute player of Munson.</p>

<p>But oh, how changed! The difference between a dying, tattered
moth and a young, brilliant butterfly. He fairly shimmered with
goldwork and with silks. He sat at a table gambling with chips
stacked high before him, and with every gesture he seemed to sweep
fresh oceans of money toward himself.</p>

<p>There was little else that stirred in that room, filled with
drifting smoke oceans from cigars and cigarettes. No other game was
in progress. Men stood about in banks and shoals watching the
progress of the campaign of the flute player, studying his calmly
smiling face and the desperate eyes of the other four who sat at
the table with him. There was a mortal silence while the game was
in active progress.</p>

<p>It was only during the shuffling and the dealing that any talk
was allowed, and in the first of these intervals Sammy spoke to his
nearest neighbor: "Who are they?"</p>

<p>The other did not turn his head. He answered softly: "Look at
'em hard, tenderfoot! The chap with the long white face is 'Boston'
Charlie. And him with the pair of blond-looking eyes is Don
McGillicuddie. The big gent with the cigar stuck in the side of his
face is Holcum. I guess you've heard of him, all right. And there's
Billy Champion, him that made the gold strike in the Creek last
year. And the one with the chips in front of him is the king of 'em
all, poor kid. He's Jeremy Major!"</p>

<p>"Why do you call him 'poor kid,' then," asked Sammy.</p>

<p>"You see him now. He's got them eating out of his hand. They're
all crooks, and he knows it. They're rich, and he knows that. And
he'll trim them out of every cent they got. Because he's a slicker
and a cooler gambler than the best of 'em."</p>

<p>"Is that why you pity him?"</p>

<p>"No, but after he has a million in his poke, he'll let it drift
out again like water running through his fingers. They's a curse
ort poor Jeremy Major. He's the only man in the world who can't
say: 'No!' And when he's flush, he hands out the stuff with both
mitts! Listen to me, kid! I've seen a gent step up and touch him
for ten thousand in cold cash&mdash;and get it! And him one that
Major never knew before that day! Aye, them same four skunks that
are getting busted now, they know that they can go around to him
tomorrow morning and beg back most of what they've lost!"</p>

<p>"But if he's so sure of what he does with the cards, why do they
play with him?"</p>

<p>"Because they are gamblers, even if they're crooked. And they
figger, every time, that they sure got some new tricks that'll beat
Jeremy Major. And so they come and try their luck with
him&mdash;why, look at Holcum, there! He's been away in the East,
and they say that he cleaned up more'n a quarter of a million
there. Besides, he got some new ideas, and he come all the way back
West to see if he couldn't be the first man that could say that he
had busted Jeremy Major at a card table. And now look! Look at the
chips in front of Major. And Holcum has got one pile left. That's
all!"</p>

<p>Another new and dazzling side light had been thrown upon the men
of the West for Sammy. He could not tell how deeply this gay young
beggar-gambler-musician was to enter into his life. But he took one
more long look at the youth, and then he turned out into the night
to find his bed and go to sleep.</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; THE SECOND
HERD</h2>

<p class="first">All was arranged almost without the volition of
Sammy, and certainly without any effort on his part. How the news
was spread he could not, of course, guess. But a whisper seemed to
have passed around, for the next morning a smiling fellow appeared
before him&mdash;a brown-faced, good-natured looking chap who said:
"I hear that you're trying to find cheap horses, Mr. Gregg?"</p>

<p>"I'm looking for them. Cheap good ones," said Sammy Gregg.</p>

<p>"Which is exactly the kind that me and my friends handle," said
the stranger. "But there's only one peculiarity about 'em."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Sammy.</p>

<p>"They got sort of sensitive natures. You see, they don't like to
have questions asked about 'em."</p>

<p>Even so green a tenderfoot as Sammy could understand this
innuendo. And he grinned with perfect comprehension and raised his
hand to adjust the bandage which encircled his head.</p>

<p>"All right," said Sammy. "I don't intend to talk them to death.
Their family affairs are their own business."</p>

<p>The other nodded. "How many, and what's your price?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I want about three or four hundred," said Sammy. "What sort of
a price can you make me on that lot?"</p>

<p>"Three or four hundred!" said the other, and whistled. "Why,
that's quite a handful! Suppose we say two thousand for four
hundred head, all warranted sound?"</p>

<p>Sammy, who saw nearly his entire block of remaining capital
involved, and who knew that he needed leeway for herding expenses,
fought for a margin.</p>

<p>"Sixteen hundred dollars," said he. "And I'll take my chance on
the sort of horses you give me."</p>

<p>The other frowned, but only for a moment. "Is that your top
price?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Partner," said Sammy, "I've just lost two hundred head. And
I've got to pay heavy for good hands to drive this lot."</p>

<p>"I'll send you three Mexicans, born in the saddle. They'll drive
'em north for you at thirty dollars a month. How does that
sound?"</p>

<p>It sounded very loud to the ear of Sammy Gregg, and he closed
with the proposition at once. The rest was arranged in a trice. He
was simply to head for the river at once, and a week from that
night, at a named point, a herd of horses would be driven across
the Rio Grande with three Mexican punchers in their rear. After
that, the rest was in the hands of fate and Sammy Gregg. He need
not pay a cent until the horseflesh was every bit of it north of
the river.</p>

<p>So Sammy made his preparations and on the appointed night he sat
in the saddle on a long, lean, bay mare as ugly as a caricature and
as fleet as the wind, under a little hill of sand beside the river,
with a sack of gold tied to his saddle bow and a pair of heavy
Colts weighting down the two saddle holsters.</p>

<p>It was well past midnight before anything stirred on the south
side of the little stream, so muddy that it would not take the
glitter of the stars on its face to show them back to the sky. But
when there was a stir it was a sudden upheaval out of the dark and
then a noise like a great rushing wind, and after that a volley of
shadowy forms that plunged into the water and dashed it to clouds
of milky foam.</p>

<p>Out of the river, squealing, snorting, neighing like a small
pandemonium, the charge continued onto the northern bank and then
past the amazed Sammy Gregg and thundering away into the darkness
of the northern night. Behind them rode three cursing cavaliers,
and without a word to him, spurred past on the trail of the
mustangs.</p>

<p>But that was not all. For now out of the river arose half a
dozen riders and swept around him.</p>

<p>He recognized the voice of the good-natured man, not quite so
good-natured now!</p>

<p>"Let's have a little look at your wallet, Gregg!"</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the summons. He tossed it across to the
speaker and thanked the caution which had made him bring not a
penny more than the stipulated price. He saw that money counted out
by match light. Then, with a grunt of disgusted disappointment, the
case was tossed back to him.</p>

<p>"Sixteen hundred even! It's plain that you ain't paying us for
all the fun we're giving you, Gregg!"</p>

<p>"I didn't know," grinned Sammy, "that it would be such a
show!"</p>

<p>"Well, old son," spoke up another, "all I got to say is: Ride
them ponies north as hard as their legs will fetch 'em along,
because there is folks on their trail that's mighty curious about
where they're galloping to."</p>

<p>Sammy, glad to be gone on this hint, turned the head of his mare
in the direction of the disappearing thunder across the plain.</p>

<p>"And keep them greasers on a tight rein, Gregg. Don't let 'em
hold you up for more than thirty a month."</p>

<p>We all believe in good beginnings, no matter how philosophical
we may be. And Sammy, when he contrasted this smooth opening of his
campaign with the knotty work which Manuel had had to do the time
before, was sure enough that his scheme was due to pan out, at
last.</p>

<p>It took an hour of brisk riding before he caught up with the
rear guard of the herd. And, when he came up to them, he found the
broncos pretty thoroughly subdued. They had had enough running to
content them, and it would take a whole thunderstorm to rout them
on a new stampede.</p>

<p>Here, there, and beyond, in the rear of the trailing herd, he
could spot the Mexican punchers by little sparks of light. That
meant that they considered that the worst of this night's labor was
completed. They were smoking in content. And Sammy sighed with
relief. Next day he would slip into town to get the few remaining
dollars which belonged to him, pack up their grubstake for the
trip, and swing out again to rejoin the herd.</p>

<p>In the meantime, he watched hungrily, joyously, as they drifted
through the nighttime. Four hundred mustangs, and by the manner in
which they kept bunched without trailing laggards, he judged that
there were no cripples in the lot. Four hundred! He counted them
roughly and found that the number was actually exceeded by
five!</p>

<p>What noble thieves were these frontiersmen, more than living up
to their contracts!</p>

<p>Four hundred ponies. Even suppose that a whole hundred of them
were stampeded away on the trip, three hundred at fifty dollars a
head, even, meant fifteen thousand in his pocket.</p>

<p>"I am going to be lucky!" said Sammy aloud, and fervently. "The
bad luck can't hit me twice in the same place!"</p>

<p>He went on in a dream about Susie Mitchell and the home which
was to be theirs. I think that Sammy had begun to idealize her at
last. Perhaps she was ceasing to be so much of a habit with him,
and becoming rather a passion. Distance and time is apt to work
like that on the mind of a lover.</p>

<p>He reached the town by the dawn. He was back again at the herd
by the falling of the night, and he found that all had gone well
with them during the day. There had been no mishaps. There had been
not so much as a single beginning of a stampede. Not a single horse
had gone lame and fallen behind. In a word, the record of that
glorious first day was not marred by a single scar. And to see
those horses in the daylight!</p>

<p>They were not like his other herd, those ugly little rascals
from the sunburned deserts of Texas. These creatures had come off
good grass and a lazy life. They were sleek and round. And they
carried their heads and their shining eyes after the way of free,
wild things.</p>

<p>"These hosses got sense pretty good!" said one of the Mexicans
in tolerable English. "If we get a few good quiet days, they'll
herd like sheep, just like sheep!"</p>

<p>They had good days, three handsome ones, hard-running. The work
was easy. They reached water often enough to keep up the heart of
the herd. There was enough grazing grass along the way. And now the
herd had become deftly organized. There were certain known leaders
which trotted in the van. The whole procession moved in a great,
scattered wedge.</p>

<p>They covered a huge amount of ground. Not during the marching
hours, when they were urged along by the riders behind, but in the
morning and in the evening when they scattered to feed.</p>

<p>Sammy, staring with delight, would see the rising and the
setting sun flash over a whole landscape which was flooded with
horseflesh that belonged to him.</p>

<p>Then, on the evening when Sammy estimated a hundred and fifty
miles lying behind them, just after they had made camp by a water
hole and while the herd was ranging freely to find the best of the
bunch-grass, just at that quiet time trouble struck them again!</p>

<p>It reminded Sammy horribly of that other night in the mountains
thirty miles from Munson, when Manuel had died. But this time the
thieves came out of the rolling hills, waving their arms, screaming
wildly, and gathering the herd in instant flight before them. Oh,
cunning devils! For they turned the rushing mass of horseflesh
straight upon the camp. With Sammy's own property they would
destroy him and then make off in safety!</p>

<p>He made for the tall mare in a mad haste. No time for saddling.
He had a revolver in one hand. And he wound his other hand into her
mane and swung himself up with all his might. He just managed to
hook a heel over the sharp ridge of the mare's back. Then he
slumped into place, and, with a side glance, he saw where one of
the herders, who had foolishly tried to saddle, was caught and
overwhelmed by the sweeping wave of horses. Even the death shriek
of the poor fellow was stifled and lost in the roar of the hooves
which beat him to a shapeless mass.</p>

<p>The forefront of that racing world of horses involved Sammy and
then, in another moment, the mustangs were shooting ahead and he
was in the rear&mdash;in the rear with the three thieves!</p>

<p>Where were the Mexicans? The last two of them sat their horses
at a little distance and tucked their rifles into the hollows of
their shoulders. A whirl of bullets began. One struck a mustang in
the herd just before Sammy and made the poor creature leap with a
squeal high into the air.</p>

<p>Aye, and there was another target. For the robber who was
nearest to Sammy suddenly tossed up his arms and lunged from the
saddle. Then the first fighting madness of his life came to Sammy.
There were two thieves left, whirling in their saddles and dumping
hasty bullets toward the two cool Mexicans. Aye, and they were fast
rushing out of range, and four hundred stolen mustangs streaming
before them!</p>

<p>All of this whirled through the brain of Sammy. And then he
found himself belaboring the ribs of the mare with his heels and
rushing her after the herd. He had no means of guiding her. But, in
her panic, she naturally took the direction which the rest of her
kin were fleeing; and it so happened that the particular route she
selected carried her straight at a red-headed ruffian who bestrode
a tall roan. One instant he was shouting and waving at the
frightened herd. The next, he was wheeling in the saddle and
shooting marvelously close at the Mexicans.</p>

<p>Then he saw Sammy and yelled at his companion: "Hey, Jerry,
what's this comin'?"</p>

<p>"A joke, Tom!" shouted the other. "Throw a chunk of lead in the
fool."</p>

<p>"I'll do that for us!"</p>

<p>Turning in his seat, he snapped his Winchester to his shoulder
again and fired point blank at Sammy, not thirty yards behind.</p>

<p>He was a good shot, was Tom, and moreover, he fired this time in
perfect surety and contempt of his enemy. But, when he looked back
again, Sammy was still coming, coming with a wild yell of rage, of
fearless battle lust.</p>

<p>For Sammy was a man transformed. It is not the pleasure of the
gods that the big men alone can go berserk. Little men can do it
also. And Sammy was literally running amuck.</p>

<p>Ordinarily he could never have stayed on the back of that
long-bounding mare for a single moment without saddle and stirrups
to help him and steady him. But he was thinking of something more
than a fall to the ground, at this moment. And, riding without
self-consciousness, he rode very well, balancing himself adroitly
and gripping with his weak knees, and waving above his head one
clenched fist and in his other hand the Colt.</p>

<p>He who had never shot off a firearm in his life!</p>

<p>He made a weird enough picture, with that white bandage clasping
his head, and his hair flowing above the bandage, and his hat blown
off, and his unbuttoned sleeves flying up around his shoulders and
showing his skinny arms.</p>

<p>Have you seen a little spindling, nervous weakling of a boy fly
into a passion in the schoolyard and make the bigger boys run in
sheer terror at the devil which is in him? So it was with Sammy.
And big Tom, the horse thief, who had been in many and many a
fight, running and standing, before this day, looked back again to
see if his odd enemy had not fallen to the ground. And behold,
there he was, and now not more than fifteen yards away, and gaining
at every leap of his horse! For the mare was a born sprinter.</p>

<p>Fear leaped into the strong heart of Tom.</p>

<p>"Help, Jerry!" he screamed, and jerked up the muzzle of his
rifle again.</p>

<p>He saw Jerry fire; and he saw the little madman behind him
merely laugh, and urge his mare on more swiftly. Even Jerry had
missed! Something jammed in the rifle. Tom dropped it with a wild
shout of pain and snatched out a revolver.</p>

<p>Time for speed, now. For here was Sammy Gregg rushing along not
two lengths of a horse behind him. As big Tom wheeled in the saddle
again, Sammy shoved forth his own gun, and set his teeth, and
closed his eyes, and fired.</p>

<p>His eyes were still closed when the mare stumbled upon something
soft, and went on. He looked forth before him, and there he saw
that the big roan horse galloped riderless before him. He glanced
behind and there lay a figure sprawled on the ground.</p>

<p>Sammy Gregg, the mild and the weak, had killed a man with his
own hand and in his own right!</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch9" name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX. &mdash; MORE HARD
LUCK</h2>

<p class="first">It would have been too much to expect any qualms
of conscience from Sammy. Indeed, he was half mad with the joy of
the fight. And he could see that his deed had worked an effect upon
the two Mexicans, also. They had left off their useless,
long-distance firing, which had only served, after the first death,
to bring down two mustangs. Now they were running their ponies as
fast as they could to get up to the scene of action.</p>

<p>There would be no time for that, Sammy vowed. He himself would
settle the remaining thief. For, if a man can be shot with one's
eyes closed, cannot another be disposed of still more effectually
with eyes open? So thought Sammy. And he wanted blood!</p>

<p>He struck the mare a resounding thump on the side of the neck
and caused her to swerve violently to the side and head, indeed,
straight for the last of the trio.</p>

<p>He had not waited for the charge! He had seen two of his
companions fall upon this luckless evening, and he was not the
stuff which wishes to fight out stubborn campaigns along one line,
even if it takes all summer. In fact, he had had enough, for his
part, of firing at a lucky, gun-proofed fool of a man like this
wild fellow who rode without saddle or bridle and who waited to
come within arm's reach before he fired his weapon.</p>

<p>The third thief, in short, wheeled abruptly away and now was
flying for his life.</p>

<p>Sammy would have followed, willingly. But when he hammered at
the ribs of the mare, it just so happened that one of his heels
struck a spot which had already been thumped very sore in that wild
evening's ride. And the mare, at that instant, decided that she had
done enough for one day. She set about unseating her rider,
therefore, and though she was a clumsy and most ineffective bucker,
the first humping of her back and the very first stiff-legged jump
snapped Sammy from her back and deposited him in the dust.</p>

<p>To Sammy it was like a drop into deep sleep from which he was
awakened by the voice of a Mexican, a changed voice, no longer
snarling and sullen, but filled with respect and gentlest
solicitude. So Sammy sat up and blinked fearfully around him. What
he saw was the herd, which had been headed by his two hired men,
trooping back toward the spot which had been originally selected
for that evening. Behind them rode one of the men; the other had
come to assist the fallen "boss."</p>

<p>He had been a silent man before this. But now Pedro was
transformed. Words ran like water from his lips. He himself had
guessed it, and he himself had told his companion, Gonzalez, he
vowed, that Se&ntilde;or Gregg was probably a great fighting man.
But to rush on bareback in this fashion straight upon a
desperado&mdash;this was a thing which even he, Pedro, had not
expected!</p>

<p>For his own part, he would have been on the heels of the
villains long before, had it not been that his scoundrel of a
horse, which he hoped to see die in torments, balked at the last
instant and refused to carry his master toward the scene of
danger!</p>

<p>All of this while he assisted the dizzy "boss" into the saddle
on that same balky horse and led him back toward the site of the
camp. On the way, they paused to examine the three dead men. Their
poor comrade they buried where he lay, but in a shallow grave. As
for the other two, coyotes and buzzards could attend to their
remains.</p>

<p>What was of importance to the Mexicans was that they collected
no less than a hundred and twenty-two dollars from the pockets of
the two thieves who had died. They took, also, excellent revolvers,
and long rifles of the very latest and best model. They brought
this considerable heap of plunder obediently to the chief.</p>

<p>It turned the blood of Sammy cold to see the gold and silver
coins from which the body heat of the dead men had hardly yet
departed.</p>

<p>"Keep the stuff!" said he to Pedro and Gonzalez. "Keep the stuff
and take the two new horses to ride, they're better and bigger and
faster than the ponies you have now."</p>

<p>If his feats of war that evening had made him seem a new man in
the eyes of those savage followers, this stroke of generosity
raised him almost above the level of mere humanity. The wages of
two months apiece, two precious horses and revolvers and rifles fit
for a king of the plains.</p>

<p>Tears stood in their eyes. They could not thank Sammy Gregg.
They could only withdraw to a little distance and worship him
mutely.</p>

<p>Gonzalez whispered softly to his companion: "Did I not guess it
from the first? Did I not say, Pedro, that no man would do business
with the river horses unless he were a fighting man with nerves of
steel? Did I not say it? How he rode in on them! Like a devil with
no fear! As if he were riding a colt in my father's pasture!"</p>

<p>The trail from that day was a changed thing for Sammy Gregg. He
was no longer allowed to rise and catch his mare and saddle her in
the morning. It was done by swift, skillful, willing brown hands.
Neither must he soil his fine hands with cookery or with cleaning
of pans in the evening. No, for here were abler and happier cooks,
in the persons of his devoted servants, amigo Pedro and amigo
Gonzalez. They would have rolled his cigarettes and sung him to
sleep if he had wanted them to.</p>

<p>In a few brief minutes of one day he had revealed to them the
two qualities which, alone, they esteemed&mdash;dauntless courage
and almost boundless generosity!</p>

<p>Out across leagues and leagues of burning desert, now. Day by
day, wearily, steadily. They had had weather of only one kind since
the start. But on the afternoon of the very day in which the brown
of the foothills began to be visible before them, they were treated
to a change.</p>

<p>Gonzalez saw it first&mdash;a haze in the northwest, looking
like a distant dust cloud. But, as it drew nearer, they could see
that the faint mist extended from the earth to the heavens.</p>

<p>"It's going to storm!" said Gonzalez. "Let us get these horses
down into that draw. Hurry, Pedro. Se&ntilde;or Gregg, with your
help, it may be done. Ride, ride, Pedro, and head them into the
draw. The storm will keep them there. But if they have no shelter,
they may scatter like feathers in the wind. Spurs, Pedro!"</p>

<p>Pedro was already off like the wind itself.</p>

<p>The sharp eye of Gonzalez had noted a shadow across the surface
of the desert to the right, and he knew that here was one of those
hollows which might well serve almost like a barn to keep the herd
from the edge of the storm.</p>

<p>But unluckily they had come into a region of good grass, and the
result was that the younger and more eager among the mustangs had
pressed far forward, trotting from bunch to bunch, nibbling here,
and then rushing on, while the older geldings and mares lingered in
the rear.</p>

<p>The result was that Pedro and Gonzalez had far to ride to get to
the head of the column. And, in the meantime, the mist out of the
horizon was growing and changing apace. It reached, indeed, to the
very roof of the sky and now it was thickening and blackening. The
rim of the storm reached the sun. Instantly the sun was reduced to
a dim red ball which seemed to be falling swiftly and silently down
the arch of the sky.</p>

<p>No, it was only the rush of the storm clouds as they shot across
the heavens. They neared the herd.</p>

<p>A close race, surely, for here was Gonzalez ahead of Pedro and
almost at the top of the column of horses at the very same moment
that the manes and tails of the leaders of the procession began to
fan out to the sides, blown by the first breath of the storm
wind.</p>

<p>But right behind that wind came the rain itself. Already the
sun's light had been curtained away to sunset colors. Now it was
reduced to nothing more than a grisly green twilight. And the storm
came head down, reaching level, white, blinding arms of rain before
it.</p>

<p>Flying hands of stinging mist cuffed against the eyes of the
mustangs and made them whirl as though they had been struck with
whips. They bunched their backs and cowered for a moment, head
down.</p>

<p>Sammy Gregg, paralyzed by the violence of the stroke, and
stunned by the uproar which crowded against his ears, could only
grip the edge of his hat and lean his weight against the wind, and
shade his eyes with his other hand to see what was happening with
the other men and the horses.</p>

<p>He heard Gonzalez ride by a mere six feet away from him, yelling
at the top of his lungs, but in the dreadful screaming of the wind
the voice of the big Mexican sounded no louder than a far-off
whisper.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;or&mdash;and Pedro! Now is the time! Ride into them,
for the love of Heaven, and start them across the wind a little.
Start them across the wind only a little, and they will reach the
draw. Courage and help! Holla! Away with you!"</p>

<p>He rode at the huddled horses, firing his revolver, lashing at
them with his loaded quirt. The animals blinked and shrank away,
and then, one by one, they began to edge off across the wind,
staggering as blasts of renewed and freshened violence cuffed at
them broadside. Here was Sammy, understanding, now, what was to be
done, and fighting desperately to save fifteen or twenty thousand
dollars' worth of horseflesh which he could still call his own! And
Pedro, too, had aroused himself and was laboring valiantly.</p>

<p>But here fortune struck directly against them. At the very
moment when the whole herd was in a sort of blind, staggering
motion across the wind, heads low down to the ground ears
flattened, spirits dejected, at that very moment, the heavens
opened and a yellow torrent of lightning flowed down the gash. Then
came thunder like the beating of giant horses on a wooden bridge
just above their heads. Roaring, rolling, crashing thunder, as
though the whole sky was crumbling and showering to earth in vast
fragments about their ears.</p>

<p>The heads of the mustangs snapped up, and they stood alert with
terror. What were the whips and the shouts of the men compared with
this tremendous artillery?</p>

<p>The sky yawned again; again the quivering tongues of lightning
licked the heart of the heavens and edges of the earth at the same
instant. It was more than enough. The horse herd leaped wildly
away. The scourges of the wind whipped them along the path. And
they rushed back south and east, south and east, toward the land
from which they had come.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch10" name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X. &mdash; FOR HELP</h2>

<p class="first">There are two ways to follow a stampeded herd of
horses. One is to ride like mad and strive to head them. One is to
let them run out of sight and follow at a walk, on the simple
principle that a horse will stop running more quickly if he sees
there is no living thing behind him.</p>

<p>But when an eighty-mile-an-hour wind is cutting the hind
quarters of a mustang, he is apt to try to run as fast as the wind
blows and keep right on as long as the storm and his strength last.
So the three riders simply lashed their helms, to speak in naval
parlance, and let their craft drift before the wind at its own free
will.</p>

<p>They scudded along at a brisk enough rate all the rest of that
day, and, when the early darkness came, the rain was no longer with
them, but the wind was, and as far as they could peer across the
storm-darkened desert there was not a sign of a horse to be seen
ahead of them.</p>

<p>They made a silent and desolate camp that night, wringing the
wet out of their clothes before they lay down to try to sleep,
without a fire to warm them.</p>

<p>When the sun rose, there was not a cloud in the sky. The wind
had fallen away. Before the sun was an hour high, the day was
burning hot.</p>

<p>The rain had left the earth in a condition to hold sign deep and
well. And after a time they found traces enough of the herd. But
what traces! Some had run here and some had run there. Like a fleet
of merchantmen cruising here and there and everywhere at the sight
of an enemy man-of-war, the broncos each had followed its own will,
and now, in flying clusters, they were breaking for the southland,
all in that direction, but doubtless on a seventy-mile front!</p>

<p>There was not the slightest doubt as to what they should do.
They bore off to the right hand as far as they could go, and
finally reached the outermost sign of the mustangs. Along that
trail they followed. And for two days they rode before they found a
wretched score of animals in a clump of cottonwoods.</p>

<p>Twenty out of four hundred!</p>

<p>But they were not done trying. They swung to the east, now, and,
still bearing south, they drove the mustangs ahead of them as hard
as they could.</p>

<p>In this fashion they began to pick up some of the rest. In
clusters and flying knots here and there they found the remnants of
that fine herd which had been so well in hand only a few short days
before. But some were lost. And some had broken their legs by
stepping in the holes of prairie dogs in the blind rush of the
stampede, and some had ruined themselves on murderous barbed wire,
and some had run into other men who wanted them almost as badly as
Sammy Gregg did.</p>

<p>Still, day after day, getting closer and closer to the point at
which they had begun their weary trek, they kept gathering in the
mustangs. Until, in due time, they counted noses, considered their
position, and decided that they had collected as many as they
possibly could. Three long weeks had elapsed since the stampede.
Three terribly vital weeks to Sammy, whose eye was on the six
months' limit, now. And they had raked together, finally, two
hundred and ninety-odd mustangs. More than a quarter of the herd
had returned to the desert out of which it had come.</p>

<p>But Sammy was not downhearted. He was daunted, but not beaten.
And he said to the Mexicans: "Listen to me! My bad luck is used up
this time. The pan has been turned upside down and the last bit of
that scrambled bad luck has been dumped over my head and shoulders.
So the thing for me to do, now, is to push straight ahead. Because
we'll have no more trouble with the horses!"</p>

<p>He spoke confidently, but Gonzalez sighed and shook his head in
a covert despair. He knew horses, did Gonzalez. Not a book
knowledge, and not because he loved them, but because he had lived
with them more intimately than he had ever lived with men. He had
been with them in the desert and in the corral. He had roped and
thrown and branded and ridden herd and cared for orphaned colts and
dragged foundering broncos out of the mud of water holes.</p>

<p>He had been with them for many years, day and night, and he knew
horses! Therefore he knew that the trouble with this lot was not
over. It was hardly begun!</p>

<p>High-headed and meant for trouble that herd had been when it
came across the river, but still good herdsmanship had kept them in
hand. But this was a different matter, now. They were transformed.
They were as filled with quivering and dancing, as full of shying
and snorting and prancing as any unbroken two-year-old
thoroughbred. Terror was behind their eyes, and willfulness. They
had run through the hands of these men before, and why might they
not do it again?</p>

<p>A horse is the hardest animal in the world to lead, next to a
stubborn dog. And, like a dog, he pursues one system. He runs
straight at you, head stretched out, tail whipped away in a line.
He paralyzes you by driving straight at you, and then, when he is
close, he swerves far out to one side and flaunts smoothly
away.</p>

<p>Try to catch even one horse, even a tame old veteran of fifteen
years' service under the saddle. Try to catch him when he doesn't
want to be caught some morning. Try to catch him in a half-acre lot
and see how long it takes you, until he suddenly remembers some of
the lessons of fifteen years and stands still, rigid, stiff, hating
you out of the corner of an eye of fire.</p>

<p>Remember that, and then think of three hundred unbroken mustangs
which have recently been frightened almost to death, and who have a
hundred thousand square miles to play their tricks in. Then you
will have an idea of the problems which lay before Sammy and his
two men. Not that the Mexicans were unwilling to work. By the law
of their race, having given their hearts to this gringo, they would
not be in a hurry to recall their faith again. They would work
until the flesh was worn from their hands. But mere work will not
serve in the handling of three hundred horses shod with the wind
and whipped by hysteria.</p>

<p>However, by pains, by slow herding, giving the wild creatures
time to find themselves, toying with them, never pressing them, the
first three days of the return trip went off smoothly enough. And
then, by the ill fortune of war, they came within the sight of a
railroad track running glimmering across the desert. For an hour or
so they rolled slowly toward that double line of living light. And
then something else happened.</p>

<p>From the direction of a patch of shadow on the edge of the
horizon that was a town, no doubt, a streak of thunder began to
roll out toward them. Thunder, but coming more swiftly then even
the thunder of the storm had come! Here it flew, a long black body
running without feet. No, for its feet were that thunder to which
they listened. Aye, and it cast before it a murmur of dread down
the living lines of light which marked the way that it would fly!
And above its reeling, swaying, furious front, there was a great
black plume, a mile in length, a glorious plume, forever vanishing
at the end and forever renewed just above the head of the
monster.</p>

<p>What nerves could stand such a sight. Not those nerves, surely,
which had seen the heavens turned to fire so short a time before!
The herd tossed up its universal head, and stood and stamped. Then
eye flashed to eye. There was a shudder of dread. A sweat of horror
started out, glistening upon their drawn flanks.</p>

<p>"Heaven help us, here they go!" sighed Gonzalez.</p>

<p>As he spoke, everybody in that herd whirled about and with
flaring manes and burning eyes they stormed away through the hands
of Sammy and his men.</p>

<p>They did not pursue. They sat their horses, drawing quietly
together. They did not speak to one another for so long that their
saddle horses forgot the thrill of excitement which had run
tingling through their very souls the moment before. They were
quiet again, stretching out their heads toward the blades of
sun-cured grass which were near.</p>

<p>Then said Sammy: "It's a queer thing, Pedro. But why don't the
devils ever take it into their heads to run north?"</p>

<p>"Ah, se&ntilde;or, because they know that the spur and the quirt
and the saddle are waiting for them in the north! However, thank
heaven that the heart of the se&ntilde;or is so brave that he can
laugh!"</p>

<p>"I cannot laugh. Gonzalez, you know horses. Tell me&mdash;can we
drive those horses north&mdash;the three of us?"</p>

<p>Tears of grief stood in the eyes of Gonzalez. "Ah, se&ntilde;or,
we cannot take them! They are all like children, now. They are
afraid! What can we do with them? They do not understand our
language. And to explain one little thing to one horse, does it not
take a week or months, se&ntilde;or?"</p>

<p>"We'll go for help, then," said Sammy sadly. And he thought of
the few dollars in his pocket. "You cut south after them. Follow
them up slowly, and I'll ride to the town and hire two more men.
I've got to get them north. I'm facing a time limit, and that limit
is almost up!"</p>

<p>He turned toward the little shadow out of which the train had
rushed. Aye, he must get them north, and when he had them there he
must sell them and collect the money. And then even a fast train
East would require some priceless days in addition.</p>

<p>For the first time he thought of wiring to Susie to give him a
little extension of time. But he couldn't do it. His strength
failed him at that point. Because it was a matter of pride with
him.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch11" name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI. &mdash; A TRAMP'S
JUNGLE</h2>

<p class="first">A sharp-sided canyon ran past the town, a canyon
filled with trees and a thin sound of running water from the creek
which had cut out this little gorge. There was a gaunt skeleton of
an iron railroad bridge spanning that gully, and there was an old
wooden bridge, too. A buckboard rattled across it as Sammy
approached, the planks flopping up and down, unnailed, under the
rolling of the wheels. And a thin cloud of dust floated up.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life, great, cruel doubts began to
fill Sammy's mind. It came to him as a part of his thoughts, rather
than as a shocking surprise, when a voice from the brush beside the
road said: "Hands up, you bum, or I'll drill you!"</p>

<p>Through the shallow screen of greenery, he could see the steady
glimmer of the steel barrel of the rifle. Aye, and another rifle
beside it.</p>

<p>"All right!" said Sammy wearily, and raised his hands shoulder
high.</p>

<p>One of them stepped to the edge of the brush, his rifle at the
ready, his guilty eyes glancing up and down the road. After all,
they were perilously near the town.</p>

<p>"Ride your hoss in here, kid, and ride it in quick, or we'll
lead the hoss in and drag you!"</p>

<p>Sammy did not need threats to make him obedient. He was not
afraid, either, but he had a foolish desire to laugh, greatly, and
idly; he was only afraid to give way to the laughter for fear that
tears would follow on the heels of it.</p>

<p>The brush switched together behind him. He found his arm
clutched on either side; but as a strong pair of fingers gripped
him he heard the fellow snort:</p>

<p>"Why, Steve, he ain't got no arm at all. Like a girl, darned if
it ain't. Go easy with him!"</p>

<p>They guided Sammy and his horse down a steep slope to the bottom
of the ravine. There they made him dismount. They stripped off his
coat, first, and then, when they had mastered his wallet, they
counted out the contents.</p>

<p>"Two hundred and eighty-five dollars! Kid, maybe we ain't in
luck."</p>

<p>"And a suit of clothes, too."</p>

<p>"The devil! What good would that do us? Am I a blackbird, maybe,
that I could step into his togs? Not if I shrunk down to what I was
at twelve years old! Look at the gats he packs, too. A regular
soldier, this bo is! A regular hero, maybe! Hey, kid, did you ever
shoot one of them guns?"</p>

<p>He handled one of the Colts familiarly under the nose of Sammy.
But Sammy replied nothing. He felt that he could see to the bottom
of his future, now.</p>

<p>To return not with fifteen thousand, but with nothing! To go
back there empty-handed. To say to Susie: "I've got to start all
over again!"</p>

<p>Then she would say: "How long did it take you to make the last
five thousand, Sammy?"</p>

<p>Ten years! It had taken him ten years to make the money the last
of which was now to be divided between these ruffians. They were
conferring a little apart, only fixing him with grim side glances.
But, as they talked, so great was their contempt for him that they
allowed him to overhear them.</p>

<p>"Suppose we tie him up and leave him here?"</p>

<p>"Aw, even if we let him go, he won't have the nerve to come back
and make no trouble. Not him! He's scared stiff."</p>

<p>"Take no chances, I say, bring him in and let the chief have a
look at him."</p>

<p>"Why should the chief know about it at all? Why not skin out
with this stuff? If the chief hears about it, he'll have to come in
for his share."</p>

<p>"Why, you blockhead, do you think that not telling him would
keep him from knowing?"</p>

<p>"Well, maybe not. He's got ways of finding out. But if we was
stowed on the rods and bound East we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are batty, Steve! Would you try to get away from him?"</p>

<p>"Aw, I dunno. He ain't a god!"</p>

<p>"He's his nephew, then. No. We take the swag in and show it to
him. Come along. We take in the boob, too, and ask the chief what
to do with him."</p>

<p>They led Sammy Gregg, accordingly, through a screen of shrubbery
into a clearing and there he saw a thing which he had read of in
books before, but never seen&mdash;a tramps' jungle.</p>

<p>There are few of such jungles in the West now. There were still
fewer, then. Even for scoundrels, there were easier ways of making
a living than to skulk from town to town, robbing hen roosts and
pilfering small articles. It was precarious, too, that life of
petty thievery. Because one never could tell when one would be
hunted down by swift horsemen and queried abruptly at the point of
a revolver.</p>

<p>But there were always a few to whom exertion of any lawful kind
was so mortally uncomfortable that they would risk death itself
rather than do an hour's labor for a dollar. There will always be
such men. They are the spice of the underworld. Men who would
invite death by exhaustion and the tortures of hunger and thirst
rather than work comfortably a few hours a day, for three meals,
sound clothes, and extra money to spend at their leisure. But they,
the floating scum of the world, who exist only because they love
freedom, are the only people in the world who do not know what
leisure means.</p>

<p>For the first time, Sammy looked upon a collection of tramps not
large, but rare. A scant seven or eight were lolling about the
clearing with their hands occupied in odd jobs of mending or
laundry. They started up when Sammy entered.</p>

<p>Steve stopped their grinning queries at once. "Where's the
chief?" he said. "Has he left, already?"</p>

<p>"No, he's asleep."</p>

<p>"Well, wake him up and tell him that we got a haul!"</p>

<p>One or two hurried into the shade of a tall, wide-spreading tree
through which the sun fell and reached the ground in scattered
spots and irregular patches of gold. Stretched there, half in sun
and half in shadow, with a green heaven of branches above his head,
and scatterings of the sweet blue beyond, the "chief" slept like a
happy child, with his arms thrown out crosswise, on either side of
him.</p>

<p>He was gradually dragged to a sitting posture, reluctant to
yield to their hands.</p>

<p>"But Steve and Lew have brung in a bird and some coin on him,
chief!" they argued. "And you've been wanting some money!"</p>

<p>"Stolen money? Who the devil told you that I want stolen money?"
responded a voice which was oddly familiar in the ear of Sammy
Gregg. "Take that man away. I don't want to see him, and I don't
want to see his money."</p>

<p>"Good!" grunted Steve. "You come with us, kid."</p>

<p>But the other tramps now stood about in a close circle. They did
not like the idea of two of their compatriots getting away with
such a haul, undivided.</p>

<p>"Look here, Lew," said one of them, "d'you think that we're
simps enough to let you two get away with murder like this? Shell
out, you tightwad. Lemme see the color of the coin that you got off
him."</p>

<p>"He had twenty dollars," said Lew. "I'll give you ten and Steve
and me'll take the other ten."</p>

<p>"Hark at him sing!" scoffed another. "Twenty dollars was all
they got, and that's all that they're excited about! Twenty
dollars! Look here, Steve, it ain't gonna do."</p>

<p>"Maybe you'll search us?" asked Steve harshly.</p>

<p>"Maybe we will."</p>

<p>"Maybe you'll be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lew, drop that gun!"</p>

<p>"Why, darn your heart!"</p>

<p>"Hello!" called the sleepy voice from beneath the tree. "Bring
him back here. You can't whack up square. You have to snarl like a
lot of starved dogs over one bone. Bring him back here!"</p>

<p>Sullenly, but submitting to an authority too great for them to
resist, Lew and Steve led Sammy Gregg back before the chief, and
Sammy saw stepping forth from the shadows of the tree a person no
other than his quondam beggar and minstrel of Munson; his gambler
par excellence, Jeremy Major.</p>

<p>Jeremy Major recognized him! Aye, at the moment, that was the
thing of importance. He did not hesitate an instant, but stepping
forward he caught the hand of Sammy and shook it heartily.</p>

<p>"Were you hunting for me?" he asked. "And so you ran into this
crowd?"</p>

<p>"The devil!" muttered Steve. "He's a pal of the chief!"</p>

<p>The chief had not waited for any explanation. His voice had an
edge like a rasp as he turned to the two captors.</p>

<p>"Everything!" he commanded sharply. "Tumble it all out and lay
it in that coat of mine. And if he misses anything, I'll come after
you and let you know about it!"</p>

<p>So, to the utter amazement of Sammy, nearly three hundred
dollars in coin was scrupulously counted out before this odd
leader, and on top of the other pile of loot, finally the two long
Colts were laid, one across the other.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked the chief.</p>

<p>"That's everything," said Sammy.</p>

<p>"Nothing else that you want?"</p>

<p>"A chance to go on my way for help, that's all," said Sammy.</p>

<p>"Sit down, then," pleaded Jeremy Major. "Sit down and let me
hear about it. Because, old-timer, I owe you money, and just now
I'm broke."</p>

<p>Broke!</p>

<p>Sammy remembered the heaps and heaps of chips which had been
stacked before the place of Jeremy Major not so many weeks before,
and every chip had meant gold in that million-dollar game! Where
had it gone? Suddenly it seemed to Sammy that his own affairs and
his own losses were too small for even a pygmy to consider with
interest.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch12" name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII. &mdash; CLANCY</h2>

<p class="first">"Come," said Jeremy Major. "Sit down here with me,
if you please, and let me hear the story. You were throwing away
ten-dollar gold pieces when I last saw you, and now you seem rather
down on your luck. What's happened?"</p>

<p>He had waved away the others. And the knaves retired grumbling
and mumbling to sit in corners of the glade and glower savagely at
their chief and his friend. Only the horse of Sammy was left
standing near them, and the tall mare, glad of the good forage
here, began to crop the shade-nourished grasses.</p>

<p>There Sammy told his story. He put in everything, because his
companion seemed bent upon hearing every scruple of the tale. He
told of the first adventure, and the loss of the horses at Munson,
and the encounter with Mr. Cumnor, and what the tall and handsome
Mr. Furness had had to say.</p>

<p>He went on with the tale of the second disastrous expedition,
the storm, and the regathering of the scattered herd, and the new
stampede which had broken the spirit of himself and his two staunch
allies.</p>

<p>Jeremy Major listened to this tale with a wandering eye which
often roved above the head of his friend and rested on the branches
of the great pine above them, as though he were more interested, by
far, in the squirrel which scampered there than in the words of
Sammy Gregg.</p>

<p>"So," said Sammy, "I have told you the whole story, because you
asked for it. And now I'll ride on into the town to get another
pair of punchers to help us out, if I can."</p>

<p>He stood up, and Jeremy shook his head.</p>

<p>"But look here," said Jeremy, "I don't see that five men will
have a better chance to head that wild herd than three would have.
It seems to me that what you need is a fast horse that can carry a
rider around the herd faster than they can run away from him."</p>

<p>Sammy Gregg smiled a wan smile. "That mare," said he, "is about
as fast as any horse you could get. But she can't head the mustangs
unless she's within a few yards of the head of them at the start of
their run. And even when she does get in front of them, they simply
try to run her down."</p>

<p>"Well," murmured Jeremy sympathetically, "I'll show you a horse
that they won't run down. Hello, Clancy! Come here, you fat,
worthless loafer, and let the gentleman see you. Hey, Clancy!"</p>

<p>In answer to this somewhat peevish call a glimmering black form
slid out from the shadows and stood before Sammy Gregg with an
inquisitive eye upon his master. And the sunlight scattering
through the branches of the tree tossed a random pattern of
brightest, deepest gold over the black satin of the stallion's
coat.</p>

<p>Sammy Gregg, who was only beginning to know enough about horses
to form a picture in his mind of an ideal&mdash;Sammy Gregg,
staring at this black monster with a new vision, understood why the
stallion as he stood could be worth more than the value of all the
four hundred wild mustangs which had been driven to him across the
Rio Grande, worth more than the four hundred could ever fetch if
they were delivered even in far-off Crumbock, where the labor of
the mines used up horseflesh hungrily every day.</p>

<p>"I'm going to ride back with you," said Jeremy Major, "and try
to help you to drive those mustangs north. Not that I'm much of a
fellow when it comes to handling mustangs. But Clancy, here, is. He
has a way of handling them that would surprise you."</p>

<p>"Partner," said Sammy, filled with awe, "I can't afford to pay
you what you're worth!"</p>

<p>"Thirty a month," said Jeremy Major, "will do for me. You start
on out of the ravine, and I'll catch up with you. I have to say a
few words to the boys before I leave them!"</p>

<p>Sammy obeyed gladly enough, and with every step that the tall
mare struggled up the side of the ravine, it seemed to Sammy that
his heart was raised that much higher in hope. So he came to the
level going above and let the mare canter briskly away. Back there
toward the south, Gonzalez and Pedro were doing their best to come
on traces of the herd. How long would it be before the rider of the
black horse arrived?</p>

<p>A scant half hour, and here he was, swinging across the plain
beside him. And how lazily the big black went! Now there is a
peculiar vanity in every man which makes him think that the horse
he is riding can run a little faster than any other horse in the
world, at least for a little distance. And Sammy, who had felt the
tall mare take wings under him more than once, could not help
slackening the reins a little. She stretched away at close to full
speed instantly.</p>

<p>"We might as well travel while we have a good surface without
prairie-dog holes, you know!" said Sammy by way of explanation, and
he turned to look back at the rider of the stallion. No, here was
the black horse at his side. Galloping how easily&mdash;no, simply
floating along, windblown, above the ground. For each of those
tremendous bounds advanced the big animal the length of a long
room, and yet he seemed merely to flick the ground with his toes in
passing.</p>

<p>There was no lurch of straining shoulders. There was no pounding
of hooves. But like a racing shadow the monster flew across the
plain. Not freely, either, but with the hand of the master fixed on
the reins, and keeping a stiff grip upon the stallion's head, lest
he might rocket away toward the horizon and leave the poor mare
hopelessly and foolishly behind him.</p>

<p>Sammy was in deep chagrin. But joy took the place of shame at
once. How would this black giant round up the herd of the flying
mustangs when they attempted to scatter away across the plains?
Aye, there was not long to wait for that!</p>

<p>They reached Pedro and Gonzalez in another hour or so, the mare
foaming with her effort, the black untouched by his gallop. And
Sammy saw the cunning eyes of the Mexicans flash wide in a stare of
wonder as they surveyed Clancy.</p>

<p>They had a hot trail by this time, and by mid-afternoon, they
sighted the herd, or at least a wing of it. Clancy was off at once.
No fencing about to slip past them. He ran straight up on them, and
while the three other riders pounded along far, far to the rear,
vainly striving to keep up, they saw Jeremy Major go crashing
through the herd.</p>

<p>"But now that he is in front of them, what will he do, one man!"
suggested Gonzalez darkly. For Gonzalez knew horses, and
particularly Gonzalez knew that herd.</p>

<p>He was answered quickly enough. They saw the mustangs bunch
rapidly together, while the shining stallion glimmered back and
forth before them like a waved sword.</p>

<p>That whole section of the herd abruptly turned and headed north
again, and it had been managed in a trice, all in a trice! And only
one sound had come to the ears of the rearward three as, in wonder,
they spurred to the side to clear the path for the truant ponies,
and that sound was the high-pitched neigh of an angry stallion!</p>

<p>"Do you hear?" gasped Gonzalez. "He makes his horse talk to
them! Who is this man?"</p>

<p>That was not all. Through the rest of the afternoon the black
horse and his rider ranged freely toward the south and east, and
while Sammy and Pedro strove to steady the redeemed portion of the
herd toward the north, Gonzalez dropped to the rear to pick up the
sections of tired ponies as Jeremy Major sent them flying in with
the stormy neighing of the black horse ringing in their rear. The
whole assembly was completed by the dusk. They counted heads, then,
and found that the last stampede had cost them forty mustangs.
Still there were two hundred and fifty ponies to take north, and at
a good price all might still be well with Sammy Gregg.</p>

<p>Except that the time was pressing, and the end of six months
drew daily closer and closer!</p>

<p>But the daily drive became a different thing, after this. A
thunderstorm caught them on the very next morning, but when the
herd strove to race westward away from the flying rain, away from
the ripping lightning, the black stallion was before them, ranging
swiftly back and forth. And much as the herd might dread the wrath
of the elements, they seemed to dread the wrath of Clancy even
more. For presently their flight was checked, and they turned
cringingly back to face the wind-driven rain.</p>

<p>"This thing," said Gonzalez somberly, "was never seen before!
And I think that we shall never see it again. See how the black
devil goes for them&mdash;hello! He had taken the head off that
one!"</p>

<p>This as a fine, cream-colored horse showed a nasty pair of heels
at the head of Clancy. But only to have the black bound up with
him, and take him by the arched crest of the neck in his teeth, and
shake him as a cat shakes a rat. The frightened pony screamed with
pain and terror, and his cry made the last of the rebels turn
shuddering into the rain. They knew their master and his handiwork
now!</p>

<p>"And yet," said Gonzalez, "I have seen the same thing. Now that
I remember, I have seen a stallion turn his herd straight back into
a sandstorm to get them away from the danger of men that lay in
front. But those were wild horses. And this, it is very
strange!"</p>

<p>"But beautiful!" said Pedro. "He has saved us two hundred miles
of riding, this morning with his work!"</p>

<p>Aye, and the next day they saw the black stallion drive two
hundred and fifty terrified mustangs straight at the railroad
track, even while a train of cars was thundering across the
desert.</p>

<p>What time they made across the rest of the desert, and then over
the foothills, while the mountains turned from blue to brown before
them!</p>

<p>"If we pass Munson with no trouble," suggested Sammy. "But I
think that that is the chief place of the horse thieves."</p>

<p>"We'll do our best," said Jeremy Major. "But they're not human
if they herd away. A quarter of a thousand mustangs, and prime good
ones, too!"</p>

<p>They did attempt it. But Sammy and the two Mexicans saw little
of the effort. They only knew that it was made in full daylight by
half a dozen masked men. They saw, from the rear, how the riders
came storming down a ravine which they filled with their shouting.
Only the black stallion was near enough to check them, and to the
bewilderment of Sammy and his two Mexicans, Jeremy Major charged
straight at the enemy, gun in hand, a bullet for every stride of
the black horse. Then one of the strangers ducked sharply over his
saddle horn. They saw another slide sidewise to the ground. And
then the rest whirled and rushed away for safety toward the head of
the mountains.</p>

<h2><a id="ch13" name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; SAMMY
RETURNS</h2>

<p class="first">The fallen man was not dead. But he had a broken
shoulder from the fall and a bullet through the base of his neck,
breaking the collar bone. Altogether, it was a nasty mess. They
could not take him forty-five miles to Munson. They could not
remain with him until the wounds were healed.</p>

<p>"We'll give you your choice," said Sammy Gregg to him sternly.
"Tell me who was leading that gang and you go free, old son. And we
leave you enough chuck, besides, to keep you going here until your
pals come back for you. But if you won't tell, you can stay here
and starve!"</p>

<p>The fellow had the assurance to laugh in their faces, as though
he knew well enough that they could not be as good as their
promises.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, though," said he. "The gent that leads the
gang is man enough to make the lot of you sweat for what you've
done today."</p>

<p>And Sammy Gregg snapped at him: "Is his name Chester O.
Furness?"</p>

<p>The eyes of the wounded man widened. "Are you crazy?" he gasped.
"But I've talked enough, and you get no more out of me!"</p>

<p>They left him enough provisions to see him through, of course,
but they did it grudgingly, and then they started on for the last
and most arduous part of the trail, the final hundred miles to the
Crumbock Mines.</p>

<p>They had two hundred and forty-five mustangs when they began
that climb. They reached the mines with two hundred and
twenty-eight.</p>

<p>But though they were gaunt of belly now, oh how they were needed
at the mines!</p>

<p>The very news of the coming of the herd was enough to cause a
welcome to pour out in advance.</p>

<p>Half a dozen eager buyers found Sammy on the way down the
hillside, and when they heard that the price was seventy-five
dollars a head, he found his sales so swift that by the time he got
to the bottom of the gulch, he was minus a hundred head of live
stock and seventy-five hundred dollars in pocket.</p>

<p>"Buck up that price to eight-five dollars a throw," advised
Jeremy Major. And the thing was done.</p>

<p>But it made no difference. Teamsters were clearing enough in a
single round trip to pay for horses and wagons and all, and leave a
neat little wad of money over and above. What difference did ten
dollars a head make to them?</p>

<p>There was counted into the hungry hand of Sammy, eighteen
thousand two hundred and eighty dollars. It was a golden dream to
Sammy, a golden dream edged with a crimson joy. He took sixteen
thousand dollars. One thousand for "expenses" and fifteen thousand
to redeem his promise to Susie Mitchell. He gave the remaining two
thousand and the odd hundreds to Jeremy Major, to be divided as he
saw fit, to himself and the two Mexicans. And he did not remain
long enough to see Jeremy Major split the pot in two equal parts
and present it to wonder-stricken Gonzalez and the awed Pedro. He
did not wait to see these things, for south, south, south was the
railroad which would carry him to the house of his bride!</p>

<p>He crossed the terrible mountains to Munson in three short days,
but in doing so he well-nigh ruined the tall mare. She was a
staggering wreck when he rode her to the station. And when the
station agent barked on the leanness of the poor creature, he was
astonished to receive the mare and saddle and bridle and two good
Colts which occupied the holsters, as a present from Sammy. For,
with a ticket in his pocket, what more could Sammy wish? There were
twelve days to the end of his contract time. And in only ten days
the train was due in New York. Only ten days!</p>

<p>There was one letter at the post office from Susie&mdash;a very
brief and unhappy letter that said: "I haven't had a letter from
you in a month. What has happened? Write at once!"</p>

<p>If she could only know what had happened to him! He was no
artist to tell her how the gun in the hand of big Cumnor had looked
him in the eye. In fact, the best that he could do would be to hint
at a few things and let Susie guess the rest, and, after all, she
was usually a pretty good hand at guessing close to the truth.</p>

<p>Trains of those days were not the trains of the twentieth
century. But when Sammy walked the streets of New York again, there
was still thirty-six hours between him and his time limit. He had
not wired nor written from the West, because he felt that he might
as well give himself the small extra reward of surprising
Susie.</p>

<p>Horse and cab could not rattle him over the streets fast enough.
And so he saw the cab turn down the familiar street. He dismissed
it two blocks away. He wanted to walk to steady his nerves a
little. He wanted to drink in the familiar sights. Who but a
returned wanderer could have guessed with what joy he would notice
that the Murphy house on the corner had been recently painted. With
what a sense of pain he observed that the tall elm trees in front
of Mr. Holden's place had been cut down. They had long been
ailing!</p>

<p>There, poised on the top of the back fence of Mr. Jones, was the
same brindled cat which, two years before, had made itself famous
by biting and scratching a fat bulldog until the poor dog ran for
help! It looked as lean and as formidable as ever as it turned its
big yellow eyes upon Sammy.</p>

<p>All of these little details were mysteriously comforting,
because each of them added a touch which helped to assure him that
he was indeed home at last! How far, far away the West was, and how
barren, and how bold, and how filled with wicked, brazen men!</p>

<p>He turned up the steps of the Mitchell house. He was almost
loath to arrive there so soon, for there had been such happiness in
the stroll down the old street that he would willingly have
extended it another mile in length.</p>

<p>However, here he was. The meal, prosaically speaking, was
finished, and only the dessert remained to be eaten. Only Susie to
take in his arms! And it filled him with wonder, now, when he
recalled that he had never taken Susie in his arms before this day!
Not in both arms, strongly, as he meant to do today.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Mrs. Mitchell loomed broad and low in the
doorway, like an overloaded barge in a narrow canal.</p>

<p>"Heaven save us!" cried Mrs. Mitchell. "You ain't little Sammy
Gregg!"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Sammy, "have I changed as much as that? But I am
Sammy, just the same. I hope Sue is home?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mitchell seemed totally overwhelmed. She merely backed down
the hall, gaping at him.</p>

<p>"I'll send Mr. Mitchell to you!" said she, and whirled and
fled.</p>

<p>So Sammy walked into the front room and looked at himself with a
grin in the gold-gilt mirror between the two front windows. Many a
time, in his boyhood, he had seen his frightened face in that
mirror when he had ventured into that sanctum of sanctums with
Susie Mitchell. And now he could sit here at ease, and admire his
new, ruddy complexion. Ah, could this quiet household see the
scenes in which that tan had been acquired!</p>

<p>The heavy step of Mr. Mitchell himself approached, and now he
entered in the act of settling his spectacles upon the bridge of
his nose and smiling with professional courtesy upon his visitor.
For Mr. Mitchell was a grocer by trade, and his smile was a noted
asset.</p>

<p>"Little Sammy Gregg!" murmured Mr. Mitchell. "Turned into a
wanderer, and then come home again! After such a steady life,
too!"</p>

<p>Sammy was a little taken aback. He had hardly expected such a
reception from his future father-in-law.</p>

<p>"However," went on Mr. Mitchell mildly, "I suppose that even the
quietest of us have a small patch of wild oats that need sowing.
Isn't that so? But I never thought it of you, Sammy! However, I was
sorry to hear from the mill people that they have no place for you
now."</p>

<p>"No place for me now?" cried Sammy turning pale. "You mean to
say that in spite of their promises when I left&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's a shame how people will make promises and never intend to
live up to them, isn't it?" said Mitchell sympathetically. "But it
seems that the manager had thought it all over. Good, conservative,
close-headed business man, I have to call him! He says that when a
young man takes six months in which to turn five thousand dollars
into fifteen thousand, why, it shows what the manager calls a
little streak of foolishness, besides a desire to take a gambler's
chance!"</p>

<p>Mr. Mitchell's own opinion was so apparently tucked into this
same speech that Sammy was more amazed than ever. He was glad, at
least, that Susie remained for him to give him comfort.</p>

<p>The paper mill, however, had closed him out! After ten years of
faithful, most faithful service. Oh, all the nights when he had
remained after hours, hoping against hope that his bulldog devotion
to work would take the eye of one of the upper members of the firm!
And now this ambition wiped away!</p>

<p>"It's a very hard blow to me," he confessed to Mitchell. "I
didn't expect that of my employers. They know how I've slaved for
them."</p>

<p>"It's always this way," said Mr. Mitchell. "Unfortunately the
world is so made that one stroke of folly will erase a hundred
strokes of good sense and industry. Only one match need be lighted,
my boy, to ignite the greatest building in the world!"</p>

<p>In the far West, from which he had just come, Sammy was well
aware that such talk would cause men to say: "Aw, cut out the
Sunday-school stuff, partner!" And he had an almost irresistible
temptation to say the same thing on his own behalf. However, he
checked himself and remarked:</p>

<p>"It's a hard thing, Mr. Mitchell, if a young man is not to be
allowed to step out and take a chance for himself now and then!
Otherwise, how is he to get on?" Mr. Mitchell leaned forward in his
chair and pressed his fat hands upon his fat knees, until the palms
squeezed out on the sides, white as the belly of a fish.</p>

<p>"Young man," said he, "slow and steady is the word, slow and
steady is the word that builds life in the way it ought to be
built. Now tell me, frankly, out of the five thousand dollars in
honest money that you took West, how much did you lose?"</p>

<p>Sammy closed his eyes to calculate. "Nearly three thousand," he
said. For, up to the day of his arrival at the Crumbock Lode he
had, indeed, been that much cash out of pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. Mitchell writhed in his chair. "Three thousand," he groaned.
"Three thousand honest dollars thrown away! Why, with that kind of
money I could have built a new wing, oh, Sammy, this is a thing for
which you will grieve in years to come! Three thousand dollars at
six percent is a hundred and eighty dollars a year! Many a poor man
in Europe is toiling fifteen hours a day for smaller pay than
that!"</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and fairly groaned aloud in the pain which
the thought of such waste gave him.</p>

<p>"Ah, well," said he, "it is a fortunate thing for Susie that I
warned her and opened her eyes."</p>

<p>"Warned her?" murmured Sammy.</p>

<p>"That this would be the probable outcome of wild adventures in
the West! Fifteen thousand out of five thousand! Stuff and
nonsense! Why, young man, even I, at my time of life and with my
experience in the business world, would not attempt to accomplish a
thing of such a magnitude. It argues a wild brain on those young
shoulders of yours, Sammy, my boy. A very wild brain, but I thank
Heaven that poor Susie will never bear any of the painful results
of such folly."</p>

<p>A terrible thought blasted its way into the mind of Sammy.
"Where is Susie?"</p>

<p>"Not here," said Mr. Mitchell gravely.</p>

<p>"Not here!" echoed Sammy in a whisper. "But she's out shopping,
out calling, she's over at the Johnson house, maybe"</p>

<p>"Oh, Sammy," said Mr. Mitchell, shaking a fat, white finger at
him, "how I hope that this will be a lesson to you never again to
venture all and lose all!"</p>

<p>"My Lord," breathed Sammy, "you mean that she has left
home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but not alone!"</p>

<p>Sammy, perfectly white by this time, stood up from his chair.
"Mr. Mitchell!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Sammy," said the grocer, "I grieve for you. Upon my soul, I
grieve for you bitterly. But I trust that the lesson will not be
wasted upon you."</p>

<p>A bright spot of color came back in either of Sammy's cheeks.
There was in his eyes such a fire as Brooklyn had never seen there
before. And when he spoke, his voice was suddenly rough and
harsh.</p>

<p>"I hate to think it," said Sammy, "but it's forced on me that
you, you fat sneak, may have advised your daughter to many another
man."</p>

<p>The grocer rose also, and stood big and towering and fat as
butter above little Sammy. "Samuel Gregg," said he, "can I trust my
ears?"</p>

<p>Those astonished ears drank in the following unholy words: "You
can trust your ears, you blockhead! But tell me if I have guessed
right? Have you really told Susie to marry another man?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" shouted Mr. Mitchell in a voice which Mrs. Mitchell, in
the backyard, heard and knew and quailed beneath. "Yes! I have told
her to marry another man."</p>

<p>"And the little fool!" said Sammy. "The little fool has taken
your advice!"</p>

<p>Mr. Mitchell raised both fat hands. No, rage and bewilderment
had paralyzed him. His thick arms fell with a wheeze to his sides
again and left Sammy intact.</p>

<p>"My guess is a good guess, I think," said Sammy.</p>

<p>He stepped to the mantelpiece and lifted the picture which stood
where his picture had once reposed. And out of the frame he saw the
chinless face of young Tom Hooker, the dentist's son, a pleasant,
smiling, useless face.</p>

<p>"My Lord," said Sammy, "is this my substitute?"</p>

<p>"Young man," shouted Mr. Mitchell, "leave these premises! You
are a worthless young reprobate. Never return to this place again,
or with my own hands&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stuff!" said Sammy. And he dropped his brown fists upon his
hip. "Stuff, you fool!" said he. "I've killed men twice your size,
Mitchell. And men twice as good as you. Why, in the country where
I've been, we use fellows like you for grease! Sit down before I
wring your stuffy neck for you. Sit down, while I talk to you."</p>

<p>Mr. Mitchell turned flabby, like a punctured balloon, and sank,
almost lifeless, into a chair. His pale, fishy eyes beheld Sammy
Gregg in the act of taking a wallet from his pocket. From that
wallet Sammy counted forth, one by one, fifteen new, crisp, bank
notes of one thousand dollars&mdash;oh, magic word&mdash;to the
note.</p>

<p>Fifteen thousand dollars&mdash;a treasure.</p>

<p>And then a handful of smaller currency.</p>

<p>"And another thousand, just for luckan, other thousand to paint
the house, maybe," said Sammy Gregg, thrusting out his jaw. "Luck
was with me. And tomorrow I'm going back to the free country. I'm
through with you people back here. Why, you choke me. I can't talk,
and I don't seem to be able to think.</p>

<p>"I'm glad that Susie has that pinhead. She'd look up to a wooden
image, I suppose, and call it a man. And you can pay the bills for
the party. I wish you luck!</p>

<p>"As for me, I'm going back to the West, and roll this fifteen
thousand into a couple of million, maybe. And when I get that, I'll
have just about enough to marry one of those Western girls. And
they're worth it. Mr. Mitchell, I hope you have luck!"</p>

<p>He settled his hat upon his head, he turned his back; and he
swaggered deliberately out the front door, and only one sound
pursued him, the faint whisper of the grocer, moaning: "Six-teen
thousand dol-lars!"</p>

<p>Then Sammy found himself in the familiar street once more. But
the joy had gone out of it. Only, in the first place, he felt a
burning fierceness in his soul. And in the second place, he began
to discover that what he had said to the grocer had not been
altogether a bluff.</p>

<p>How small, after all, had been his hold upon the life in this
street when one conversation of five minutes could suffice to root
up all his interests here!</p>

<p>But out West, aye, that was different! Gamblers, hobos, thieves,
horse rustlers, miners, teamsters, villains&mdash;he felt suddenly
that they were his brothers. And that night the westbound train
took Sammy with it from Manhattan!</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch14" name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.&mdash; ANOTHER
IDEA</h2>

<p class="first">Munson had grown even since Sammy last saw it.
Here, there, and again he saw the white faces of new buildings, all
of raw, unpainted pine boards, with cracks between them so wide
that they could be distinguished a block away. For no nails in the
world could keep the half-seasoned timbers from warping, once this
hot sun got in its work on them.</p>

<p>Munson was growing, but that thought brought no cheer to Sammy.
He slumped gloomily down the street, ankle deep in dust. And the
dirt which his footfall loosened was combed up instantly and curled
like a plume over his head by the wind. He was white with a thick
layer of the dust before he got to the store which carried above
the door the name of Rendell.</p>

<p>He stepped into the door of the store, and there he encountered
almost the last person in the range that he wanted to
meet&mdash;none other than Cumnor, whose revolver had fired the
bullet that had caused a furrow to be made down the side of his
head. The hair was growing out now, along the scar, and that hair
was a white slash in a brown head.</p>

<p>The meeting seemed no more pleasant to Cumnor than it was to
little Sammy Gregg. But Sammy looked him coldly in the eye and
stepped to one side. Yet Cumnor did not pass. He stood there ill at
ease, combing his long, drooping, sandy mustaches.</p>

<p>"Gregg," he began.</p>

<p>Sammy scowled, but said nothing, and a crimson tide washed
across the heavy features of the rancher.</p>

<p>"Gregg," he repeated resolutely, "I got to tell you that I want
to apologize for the downright low trick I done to you here a while
back. Only, at that time, when you stepped up and claimed them
hosses that I had just bought from Furness, well, it went sort of
agin' the grain to pay out three hundred dollars twice for the same
stock. Y'understand?"</p>

<p>Sammy, watching him in wonder, nodded.</p>

<p>"But here," said Cumnor, "I've had a chance to think things
over. I've had a chance to see that you're a man of your word and a
square shooter. And I've got to say that I'm sorry about the
shooting, and here's three hundred dollars now, for those ponies!
Gregg, I want to be friends with you!"</p>

<p>It would have been a considerable speech in any part of the
world, between man and man. But this speech was overheard by an
audience, consisting of Rendell and a gaunt cowpuncher who was
buying a yard or so of plug chewing tobacco. And in the far West
apologies come hard. It is apt to be considered unmanly not to
persist, even in error. For that, after all, is the frontier's
unwritten law.</p>

<p>Now, Sammy was not a man who forgot or forgave lightly. And
during many a month he had taken home the thought of Cumnor to his
heart and sworn that some day he would find a means of righting the
wrong that had been done him. However, he had seen enough of the
frontier and its ways to know that this apology from such a man as
Cumnor meant almost as much as bullets themselves could write. And
he stretched out his hand.</p>

<p>"Cumnor," he said, "I believe you mean it."</p>

<p>"Mean it?" said Cumnor. "I'll tell you that I do!" And he
clutched the hand of Sammy. "And here's three hundred just to say
for certain that I don't lie!"</p>

<p>"Keep it for me," said Sammy, "until I need it. Be my banker to
that extent, old-timer."</p>

<p>The big man regarded him for a moment in wonder, and then his
glance passed over the head of Sammy and toward the rear of the
store.</p>

<p>"You were right, Rendell," was all he said, and he hurried out
from the store.</p>

<p>The cowpuncher, staring at the little man, followed. And Sammy
was left alone to shake hands with Rendell. That crippled hulk of a
man heaved himself partly up on his counter and sat there grinning
down at Sammy.</p>

<p>"Where's the wife?" said he. "Back in the hotel?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what hotel she's in," said Sammy. "She married,
all right, but she married another man!"</p>

<p>Mr. Rendell gaped, started to speak, and then busied himself
biting off a great corner from a wedge of chewing tobacco. When he
had stowed that great quid safely in a corner of his mouth, he said
solemnly:</p>

<p>"Questions is always foolish things to ask. I'm sorry,
Gregg."</p>

<p>But Sammy was able to grin.</p>

<p>"What the boys will want to know," went on Rendell, "is what
queer new dodge you're gunna try on the town this time? After
driving a few hundred hosses clean up from the river to
Crumbock!"</p>

<p>"I could never have done it. It was a man named Major."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's getting to be pretty well known, now, that same gent.
But who would have figured that you would know a gent like him to
help you out? Well, Gregg, what are you going to do this time?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Sammy. "Something big enough and hard
enough to keep me busy hand and foot and brain until I get over
feeling the way I do."</p>

<p>"Something real hard?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Start over Crumbock way and try to find the mother lode. That
ought to be a job for you!"</p>

<p>"It's hard enough to get to the mines, let alone the lode," said
Sammy.</p>

<p>"Aye, if you want a real man-sized job, start a stage to the
Crumbock Mines, old son."</p>

<p>"A stage?" said Sammy doubtfully. "Is there money in it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I ain't serious," said Rendell. "Nobody'll start a stage
line in this part of the world while there's so many gents like The
Duke, hanging around."</p>

<p>"The Duke?" asked Sammy.</p>

<p>"That's Furness."</p>

<p>"How did he get a title. Does he own one?"</p>

<p>"No, it's only a way he's got, they say, when he shoves a gun
under your nose and tells you to stand and hand over. Kind of high
and lofty, like a duke would be if he was a road agent, maybe!"</p>

<p>Sammy whistled.</p>

<p>"Have they got the goods on him?" he asked. "Is he living
out?"</p>

<p>"If there was a sheriff and a decent judge in the county," said
Rendell, "they'd find that they had enough goods to nail him, right
enough, but the law ain't more'n a baby around here, and any way
that you look at him, The Duke is sure a growed-up man. Young
Blythe and Harper was the last pair that started out to get him. We
ain't heard from them, yet. But there is three other gents in the
last three months that has gone out and started to get famous by
bringing in the scalp of The Duke, and them three has all
failed.</p>

<p>"Leastwise, they ain't showed up lately, and I don't look,
personal, for Harper and Blythe to show up neither. But nobody'll
start a stage and run men and money between Munson and Crumbock
while birds like The Duke has got their wing feathers unclipped!
Look at the Chadwick City bunch! They've closed down and offered
their stages and their whole string of hosses for sale! The hosses
has gone. But who the devil wants a stagecoach?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Sammy, "but maybe I'm the man."</p>

<p>"Hey, Sammy Gregg! You ain't takin' me seriously about starting
that stage line?"</p>

<p>"No," said Sammy. "I'm only thinking."</p>

<p>Chadwick City was only seventy miles away. And it was forty
miles farther away from Crumbock than was Munson. So Sammy rode
over to find out what he could find out. He found four
magnificently built coaches standing out in the open for the wind
and the weather to wreck, though so far wind and weather had not
accomplished much harm. For these were masterpieces of Yankee
craftsmanship in the good old days when there still were Yankee
mechanics who were proud of the things that they could shape by
hand and hammer and lathe, instead of by machine. Those coaches
were built of the very finest hickory, with a generation of
seasoning to make it tough. Tough it was, light as dry wood should
be, tough as leather, strong as iron.</p>

<p>Sammy knew little about wood, but when he heard that those
coaches had actually been used over the rough roads, he was amazed.
Certainly there was little sign.</p>

<p>"What might you want with them coaches?" asked the
representative of the defunct stage company.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Sammy. "Nothing, perhaps, and yet the running
gear might be useful for something."</p>

<p>For Sammy himself was enough of a Yankee to know how to cheapen
a price.</p>

<p>"A hundred and fifty dollars will buy the lot," said the other
sadly. "And when I think of what it cost to build ary a one of them
wagons, it makes me powerful sick, old-timer!"</p>

<p>A hundred and fifty dollars for all four! Sammy blinked and then
drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"Hold out your hand," said he. And he closed the money in the
other's palm. "Now," said Sammy, "tell me if you have had any
experience in the staging business?"</p>

<p>"I've had enough," said the other, "to keep me from ever wanting
any more. How come you to ask?"</p>

<p>"What broke up this line?"</p>

<p>"There was a sort of a lack of things," said the salesman.
"There was a lack of cooks to work in the three eatin' houses that
we had to build along the road. And there was a lack of drivers,
too, for the driving of the stages. Drivers that a man could trust,
I mean."</p>

<p>"Why," said Sammy, "the country is filled with good
teamsters."</p>

<p>"Just so," said the tall man. "But they found that stage driving
was sort of unhealthy, by reason that now and then somebody would
want the stage to stop where there wasn't no regular station, and
the most usual way he took of stoppin' the stage was to shoot the
driver and then one of the lead team of hosses. Mostly that would
stop up the stage pretty quick. But it got the drivers to feelin'
sort of restless. We lost two in one week, and after that the boys
got sort of sick of the work.</p>

<p>"Then there was a lack of passengers. They kept coming pretty
good for a time, but then they sort of got tired of having their
pockets looked into. I knowed one gent that made four trips on our
stage and three times the stage was stuck up and he lost his wad
each time. He was a gambler, so he took it pretty calm. But he
says: 'I never sticks in a game where the chances is three to one
in favor of the dealer. And the crooks is the dealers in this game
of ridin' on the stage!'</p>

<p>"Which it sort of looked like he was right!</p>

<p>"But outside of them things, and the lack of a few more, such
like as the lack of any kind of a road, and the lack of hay to
store in the sheds for the hosses at the stage stops, and the lack
of hosses that was busted for the harness work, and the lack of
harness to take the place of the leather that the broncos jumped
through their first few times out&mdash;outside of them few lacks,
there wasn't much to keep the stage line from running, except that
them that was putting up for it got sort of tired and pretty soon
they lacked the money to keep on payin' the losses."</p>

<p>To this original relation, Sammy Gregg listened with a smile, to
be sure, but also with a falling heart.</p>

<p>"Between you and me," said he, "what do you think of the chances
of running a stage from Munson to the mines?"</p>

<p>"I don't think nothin' about it. I know it couldn't pan out.
It'd break the heart of the gent that tried it. Break him inside of
a month."</p>

<p>"All right," confessed Sammy. "I'm thinking of it."</p>

<p>"Then I'm sorry for you!"</p>

<p>"Will you tell me why?"</p>

<p>"Your business is your own. But just the same, I got to ask you
why a stage would have a chance from Munson when it's failed from
Chadwick city?"</p>

<p>"We're forty miles closer, for one thing; and most of the people
bound for Crumbock come through Munson."</p>

<p>"You're forty miles closer, but you got a road that's twice as
rough. If the freighters can hardly make it at a walk, how are you
gonna keep passengers comfortable at a trot?"</p>

<p>"I don't intend to keep 'em comfortable," said Sammy. "I just
intend to get 'em there if they hang on tight!"</p>

<p>For the first time a light came in the eye of the other.</p>

<p>"That's a new idea," said he. "But you're gunna get 'em there
with a lot of stops. There's a good holdup place every quarter of a
mile along the whole road from Munson to Crumbock!"</p>

<p>There is nothing more stimulating than opposition. The man who
is winning at cards is the man who is able to stop play when he
chooses. But he who is losing cannot let go. He has to keep on
bucking fate. And the more the stage man of Chadwick City blasted
the hopes of Sammy Gregg, the more the courage of Sammy rose. We
will not believe a picture which is painted too black. Better to
throw in some relieving touches. And Sammy, when he heard that
there were no chances of winning through, began to feel that his
companion was purposely making matters worse than they really and
truly were.</p>

<p>He hired four men and four spans of horses to drag the
stagecoaches across the hills to the town of Munson, and when he
arrived, riding proudly at the head of the procession, he had the
satisfaction of having the town turn out to watch him pass.</p>

<p>Neither did Munson laugh as loud as he had expected. The idea of
a tenderfoot putting through the stage line was so very novel,
considering that the experienced old hands at Chadwick City had
failed, that Munson's citizens shook their heads and postponed
their decisions.</p>

<p>"He drove the hosses up from the river," said Rendell, "and he
got them safe to Crumbock, and one failure didn't turn him back.
How d'you know but that he'll get the stage line through to
Crumbock, too?"</p>

<p>But the buying of the stages was only the first step in a long
undertaking. He needed relay stations every eight miles, twelve
stations between the towns, and a bigger station and stables at
either end of the line. That meant twelve shacks, and two men in
each shack, one to handle the work by day and the other to handle
it by night. For, day and night, the stages must toil on.</p>

<p>The start was to be at four in the morning. The halt at night
took place not before nine, with an hour's halt at noon for the
battered passengers to eat a meal and stretch their cramped limbs.
Then, with a new driver, they scurried on again. At night they
halted at nine if they were near one of the two sleeping houses
which had to be built. And so four stages should be constantly in
use, each stage traveling sixteen hours a day.</p>

<p>Nor was this all, for allowances would have to be made for the
wastage in horseflesh which would be occurring constantly as the
mustangs struggled forward among the rocks and up the terrible
slopes of the mountains. Ruined shoulders and spoiled feet must be
a common occurrence, besides those which wasted under the daily
strain. He must have a reserve of stock to meet these
contingencies, a reserve of sixty head, at the least. And, the
instant that he started operations, he must have a payroll of at
least thirty or thirty-five men.</p>

<p>Now, with an overhead of this size looming above him, young
Sammy Gregg could understand very well how the Chadwick City line
had failed so quickly and so ignominiously. But it also occurred to
him that he might be able to buy for a song the timber which they
had used in the construction of their own way stations through the
mountains. And other thoughts formed rapidly in the brain of
Sammy.</p>

<p>He sat him down and in the room of the hotel at Munson that
afternoon he wrote the following letter to his old henchman,
Gonzalez, at El Paso:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Gonzalez:</span>
</p>

<p class="letter">I am back in Munson, and I want horses again. But
this time I want horses which are broke, and which we can take to
Munson on ropes. I want three hundred horses. Ten dollars a head
for the purchase, and ten dollars more a head for the breaking, and
five dollars extra for bringing them to Munson. Does that sound to
you? That will give you a chance to make a little profit on every
horse. If everything goes through in good shape, I may be able to
increase that price.</p>

<p class="letter">As it stands, seven thousand five hundred for the
herd of three hundred. Write to me that you want the contract, and
I'll forward five thousand dollars to you. Get Pedro, if you can,
to help with the work, and write back to me at once.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Sammy Gregg.</span>
</p>
<br>

<p>Here Sammy shuddered a little. Five thousand dollars in the
hands of a reckless Mexican! But upon second thought, he decided
that all life here in the West was a gamble, and he would have to
go ahead taking chances.</p>

<p>He sealed the letter when a strangely subdued murmur of noises
rose from the street. He glanced out the window of his room and saw
the tall form and the handsome face of him whom Munson now called
The Duke, in other words: Chester Ormonde Furness, seated in a
buckboard driving a fine pair of horses, one of which was a great
dappled gray which carried, in addition to harness, a saddle
cinched around its belly.</p>

<p>There was something covered in the body of the buckboard, and
now the wind stirred that covering and revealed two pairs of boots
with the legs of men in them!</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch15" name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV. &mdash; A THREAT</h2>

<p class="first">Two men, lying side by side in the bottom of a
buckboard, with only a thin throw of blue calico between their
upturned faces and the sun, that terrible, broiling, baking Western
sun? No, it did not seem possible.</p>

<p>Now Furness had stopped his team and the buckboard stood
stationary with the sun still baking and broiling upon the calico
and the bodies which lay beneath it. And the horrible conviction
entered the mind of Sammy Gregg that living they could not be,
since nothing human could have endured that heat without
stirring!</p>

<p>Sammy was in the street in ten seconds, and he found himself a
member of a crowd which was rapidly being recruited from every
corner of the town. There was even old Rendell, who hated activity
of any kind, now hurrying out of his store and swinging toward them
as fast as he could move his crippled leg. Old and young, the town
drew swiftly together to stare at big Chester Furness as he took
the harness off the near horse, the gray, and led it forth in the
saddle.</p>

<p>Then he climbed into the saddle and sat there with a hand upon
his thigh and his calm eyes and his sneering smile fixed upon the
crowd.</p>

<p>What might have seemed wonderful to many was that fifty guns did
not leap out of the holsters there in Munson which knew Furness so
well and which had so many reasons for hating him, that fifty guns
did not fly forth to shower lead upon him.</p>

<p>But to Sammy and to the others who were gathered there, you may
be sure that it did not seem strange, while the cold eye of Furness
was wandering over their faces, dwelling a little on each one, as
though he wished to remember.</p>

<p>So, in a breathless silence, they watched him. If there had been
a dozen sheriffs there, they could not have arrested him, because
there were no proved crimes to charge to the account of Mr. Chester
Ormonde Furness. He was not fool enough to sin recklessly in
daylight without a mask drawn over his handsome features. He had a
way of roughening and sharpening that smooth voice of his so that
no one could be sure that the ruffian behind the mask was really
this dapper Furness. No one could be sure, but they could guess
near enough. The whole county could not have delivered testimony
enough to have hanged this man, but the whole county did assuredly
know one thing, which was that Mr. Furness deserved to die with a
rope around his neck!</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, neighbors," said Furness, "and I had almost said
friends! A pity, too, that I cannot say it. For I am sure that I
have done my best to win your respect!"</p>

<p>He paused and laughed softly in their faces. And a stir of anger
worked through the crowd; and terror with the anger.</p>

<p>Oh, what a man was this, to play with these fifty human tigers
as Chester Furness was playing!</p>

<p>"But though I trust," went on the mocker, "that I may have won
your respect, still it seems that you cannot be persuaded to keep
at anything but a formal distance. However, you still remain, if
not my friends, at least, my neighbors and gentlemen!"</p>

<p>He laughed again, filled, certainly, with an exquisite devil.
And Sammy heard an iron-faced man beside him murmuring: "I wish to
heaven I had the nerve to try him, but he's got his eye fixed
special right on me&mdash;he knows!"</p>

<p>So it seemed to them all, no doubt, as though that omnipresent
eye were fixed steadily upon them, each face singled out
particularly by The Duke.</p>

<p>"But lately," said Furness, "it seems that there has been a
growing habit among you of sending out people to call upon me, to
come unannounced and give me a pleasant surprise!"</p>

<p>He paused, and there was just a little less amusement and a
little more cruel edge in his smiling.</p>

<p>"The young men of Munson and of Chadwick City," went on The
Duke, "have made it a point to drift about through the hills and
through the forest hunting for me, to pay their respects. Very kind
of them. But it keeps me rather nervous. It keeps me, in short,
feeling that I must always have my house in order, seeing that I
never know when to expect callers. The result is that I rarely
rest, and I really have to keep watchful."</p>

<p>All of those innuendoes were patent enough, and they might have
brought a snarl from the crowd, but it was too fascinated with his
narrative, now, to pay much attention even to his insults.
Something was coming, something of dreadful moment. They could
guess it, and they wondered from what direction the trouble would
strike Munson.</p>

<p>"Finally," said The Duke, "when others had failed to find me at
hometwo young gentlemen of Munson decided that they must try their
hands and come up to have a look at me. So they came up and, in the
middle of last night, they dropped in upon me, oh, most
unexpectedly! I could only sit up in my blankets and stare at them.
And they stood there and stared back at me."</p>

<p>He paused to light a cigarette, while the crowd held its breath.
But Sammy, who already guessed the point of the tale, was turning
sick with sorrow and with disgust.</p>

<p>"Of course," said The Duke, "I wanted to make them at home, but
they insisted upon doing the honors for me. They made me sit
quietly there by my fire with one of them on each side of me. We
were all very quiet, for a time!"</p>

<p>He laughed again. And when he stopped laughing, his nostrils
were quivering, and his eyes flashed like whips across the faces of
the crowd.</p>

<p>"They could not think of very much to say, so it seemed, and so
they filled in the interval toying with their Colts. And as for me,
I was so pleased and surprised to have them with me, that you can
imagine that I was quite dumb! However, they presently fell into a
discussion as to which of them could rightly claim the honor of
having found my campfire. And, after that, they grew quite hot over
the point of which of them had the pleasure of first confronting me
in my camp.</p>

<p>"You will not believe me when I tell you how irritated they
became. Suddenly they had jumped to their feet. They declared that
they had had enough of one another. I, sitting on the ground
between them, begged them to lower their voices, because the
buzzards might be listening!"</p>

<p>The Duke tilted back his head and laughed, with a sound like the
snarl of a wolf buried deep in his throat.</p>

<p>"But all I could say was as nothing to them. I have told you
already that they had their guns out. Now they jerked them up to
the hip. I think young Harper fired twice; and young Blythe fired
only once. But, unfortunately, both of them shot too straight!"</p>

<p>He paused and looked with mock sorrow around him.</p>

<p>"To my most stinging grief, I found myself suddenly sitting with
a dead man upon either side of me, each shot cleverly through the
head.</p>

<p>"Imagine my confusion and my sorrow!</p>

<p>"But as I sat there through the night with the dead men, it
occurred to me that I really owed it to the town of Munson, and my
acquaintances there to let them know just how these poor young men
had stumbled into the arms of death, so to speak, in spite of my
protests against it!</p>

<p>"It seemed to me that I should try to find some way in which I
could discourage those fine young men of the towns from wandering
through the hills trying to catch me unawares. Because I was afraid
lest they might, also, quarrel with one another, just as poor young
Harper quarreled with poor young Blythe about which of them should
take precedence in my camp.</p>

<p>"Finally, it seemed to me that the very best way I could manage
the thing would be to carry Harper and Blythe into the town and let
their friends see just what they did to themselves. And so,
gentlemen, here they are."</p>

<p>He snatched the blue calico sheet away from them and let the
staring, horror-stricken people look on the dead faces of the two
boys. Their guns were still in their hands, placed there by the
devilish forethought of Mr. Furness.</p>

<p>"It is my modest trust," went on Furness, "that the other young
men from the towns in this neighborhood will be deterred from
following the same example, because I really should not like to
waste many more days carting the poor young men back to Munson or
to Chadwick City. Gentlemen, I make a present of the buckboard and
the bay horse to the town of Munson. Until old Mr. Graham happens
along, as no doubt he will before long, to remark that I was forced
to borrow it from him. Tell him, then, that the roan horse broke
its legs, and so I put it out of its pain and harnessed my own
galloper in its place. However, he need not thank me for that!</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, good day. May we continue to be just as neighborly
as ever. But let my next callers announce themselves to save
confusion!"</p>

<p>Here he was reining his great gray horse backward down the
street. No, he dropped the reins, and so perfectly trained was that
magnificent stallion, that it continued to back gradually down the
street, leaving the left hand of Mr. Furness free to take off his
hat and salute with it the staring crowd, while his right hand
still rested jauntily on his thigh, near to the butt of a Colt
revolver. He reached the next corner. A sway of his body caused the
well-trained stallion to leap sidewise, like a cat, throwing the
master behind cover. And so he was away.</p>

<p>Of course there was a reaching for guns the instant his terrible
eye was removed from them, but by the time they reached the corner,
the stallion was already out of view behind a hill.</p>

<p>There was no pursuit of The Duke, for, as Rendell remarked,
though every one knew that Mr. Furness had lied rankly and that the
bullets which killed the two adventurous youths had come from his
own revolver, yet what way had they of proving what they felt to be
the truth? They could only think their thoughts, but so far as a
legal case against Furness was concerned&mdash;they had not the
shadow of a ghost of one!</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch16" name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI. &mdash; THE STAGE
LINE</h2>

<p class="first">Sammy had to employ teamsters, in the first place
to bring the lumber of the station houses of the Chadwick City
Company, which he had bought for a song. And when the timber
arrived in Munson, he had to send it out to each of the stations
which he had selected for his own route. He had picked those
stations with much care, sometimes making a long distance between
points of relay, but always striving, if possible, to give each
station plenty of wood and water and grazing land, which must next
be fenced in for the horses.</p>

<p>He had heard from Gonzalez. By the grace of good fortune, that
able cavalier had come to Juarez in time to get the letter. Now he
was busy gathering mustangs and breaking them, using a hardy crew
of men for the work. But it was difficult. To break a horse to the
saddle was one thing. To break it to pull a wagon was quite
another, most fabulously considered to be an easier task!</p>

<p>In the meantime, the work went forward in spite of all
difficulties. The stations of relay were located and built, and the
pasture lands fenced in near them, and hardy men were gathered. A
ticket agent at either end of the line, and eight skillful, daring
men who were willing to risk their lives driving the stages, and
twenty men to man the relay stations. And, in addition to all of
these matters, a thousand little details which no one but Sammy
himself could supervise. He was flying back and forward between
Munson and the Crumbock Mines nearly every day. He had to keep a
string of horses in both towns, and all those nags were worn almost
to a shadow.</p>

<p>One pleasant discovery was made almost at the beginning of the
affair. The men of Crumbock were disposed to smile at the slender
little thin-faced man who declared that he was going to put a stage
line through from Crumbock to the outer world, but when word came
up from Munson that this same little man was already known there
and that he had been as good as his word in at least one other
large transaction, Crumbock came instantly out of its smiling humor
and began to pat Sammy on the back.</p>

<p>For Crumbock was being stifled, fairly stifled, for the lack of
proper transportation between its mines and the town beyond the
rough, inner core of the highest mountains.</p>

<p>The lode needed man power for its development, for one thing,
and whoever wanted to cross the mountains had to pack up three
days' provisions, bought at famine prices in Chadwick City or in
Munson, and thence plod wearily on a five or a seven-day trip to
the mines. And men bound for mines do not like to have a week's
walk put in at some point on the journey.</p>

<p>But man power was the least of the troubles at the Crumbock
mines. All that was needed for the mines, from ironwork to powder,
had to be delayed to the speed of the wagons which crawled wearily
across the mountains. A small thing could delay a teamster for a
week. A broken axle might stall him indefinitely, and broken axles
were common commodities on the road from Munson to Crumbock.</p>

<p>So that the mines were throttled for the lack of rapid and
certain delivery of supplies which were so vitally needed. The slow
freight could be handled, after their manner, by the wagons, but
when a man needed, say, a set of new drills and needed them in a
rush, could he sit twiddling his thumbs while the wagons slowly
moiled away to Munson, and there waited for the goods, and then
slowly, slowly struggled back to the upper peaks where the lode
was? No, for by that time that necessary bit of drilling might be a
month out of date!</p>

<p>In short, Crumbock was a place where the necessities of
existence were growing more numerous every instant, as the ground
was broken deeper and deeper and the mining problem became more
abstruse. And there was no artery of supply. There was even no sure
way of getting letters through to Munson or Chadwick City! And a
dozen of the larger concerns were each maintaining their own mail
service, at enormous expense and uncertainty, dispatching riders
into the wilderness.</p>

<p>What wonder then, that a dozen hearts were broken when the
Chadwick City line failed them? And what wonder that a great pulse
of joy ran through the big camp when it was learned that another
line would try the shorter but more difficult passage from Munson
to the lode?</p>

<p>Little Sammy Gregg found himself received like a most important
personage at the camp. And everyone had time enough to talk
business with him.</p>

<p>Then Mexican Gonzalez arrived at Munson with the first half of
the horse herd, a hundred and fifty head of fire-eyed mustangs with
a faraway look in their eyes, and ears that quivered backward and
forward to betoken danger. However, they were all broken, after a
fashion.</p>

<p>Sammy might have his doubt of that. Whatever lessons might have
been taught, they seemed to have lapsed back into their native
wildness quickly enough on the northward drive to Munson. But at
any rate, he accepted the mustangs&mdash;he could do nothing
else&mdash;scattered them in groups along the route at the relay
stations, and prepared to make the first trip across the mountains
in his stage line, while Gonzalez returned to hurry up the second
installment of the horses which were already on the way.</p>

<p>It was an anxious time for Sammy Gregg. He had invested his
seventy-five hundred dollars in horses alone. He had paid out
fifteen hundred dollars in wages for the building of his relay
shacks and sleeping houses. He had spent another twenty-five
hundred for harness alone! It was strong harness, but the price was
lifeblood from Sammy Gregg! And beyond all that, he had invested a
thousand in the odds and ends of the necessities, such as coaches
themselves!</p>

<p>Before the first coach ran, he had spent close to thirteen
thousand dollars, and he had not yet received a single penny in
return. Oh, well for Sammy Gregg that he had already been through
that Western "school of investment!"</p>

<p>He had a scant three thousand dollars in his pocket when he saw
the team picked for the first run from Munson into the wilds. And
he saw the first return on his labor and his capital, too. Ten men,
he estimated, would be in each load, and men were willing to pay
twenty-five dollars a throw to be whirled across those mountains in
a single day and a half. Two hundred and fifty dollars for each
trip for human passengers alone, to say nothing of what would be
paid for the other freight, perhaps another two hundred and fifty!
Five hundred dollars, then, for every journey.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, six hundred and fifty dollars was paid into
the hands of Sammy's Munson ticket agent for the first loaded
coach.</p>

<p>So, with the four stages all in operation, Sammy saw himself
clearing seven or eight hundred dollars at least. Perhaps much,
much more. And those were days, be it remembered, when money meant
from three to five times what it means to the giddy twentieth
century!</p>

<p>Oh, Sammy Gregg, those were moments of golden anticipation more
thrilling than any reality. Those were the days to build dreams in
the millions! Granted that the high prices could not be maintained
indefinitely and that he must reduce his rates before a competing
line entered, now that he had shown that the trick could be turned,
granted all of that, still he would have a sweet harvest. In a
fortnight, all his capital would be returned to his pocket and he
would have a handsome profit besides.</p>

<p>Such were the stakes for which men gambled in those days.</p>

<p>However, this was the prospect. Now he was to make the trial of
the fact. He had ten passengers, and all the luggage and freight
that his coach could groan under. And the day for the trial came.
Nine men and one woman advanced to enter the coach. And upon the
driver's seat sat the gray-headed driver and Sammy, the Great!</p>

<p>Nine men and one woman, by whom there hung a story told in a
letter which Sammy at that moment had in his pocket. It read
thus:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Gregg:</span>
</p>

<p class="letter">I am making reservations in your coach, which
leaves Munson on Tuesday, for my daughter, Miss Anne Cosden, who
arrives from the East on that day.</p>

<p class="letter">She is a headstrong young person who refuses to
wait until I can come to Munson to escort her over the mountains in
person. She has formed a mad scheme for riding ,alone, the trail
from Munson to the lode.</p>

<p class="letter">I have managed to dissuade her from that by
suggesting a compromise. That compromise is your stage line.
Forgive me for saying that I look forward to her ride over those
backbreaking mountains in an unproved stage line with hardly less
apprehension than if she were really riding a pony alone through
that wilderness.</p>

<p class="letter">Nothing but the pressure of the most vastly
important business and the interests of my stockholders prevents me
from coming to Munson to act as her escort. As it is, I must leave
her in your hands, knowing that she will receive the best of
treatment from you.</p>
<br>

<p>That was the important part of the letter. And Sammy, seeing
himself with an only child, a headstrong but nonetheless precious
darling of a millionaire miner's heart put into his hands, had even
done his best to select the remaining nine passengers from among
the least rough of the applicants.</p>

<p>Then he besought his driver, a bewhiskered buccaneer named Alec,
to select from the herd at Munson the gentlest of the lot for the
first trip. Alec gave him his oath that he would do so.</p>

<p>"But," said Alec, "when it comes to goin' over a pack of powder
and pickin' out the grains that are not gunna explode, it's a sort
of a hard job, even with a microscope, Mr. Gregg. But I'm gunna go
over that lot of broncos with a microscope and see which I can pick
out."</p>

<p>So Alec had done his best. For a whole day he had mingled with
the Munson herd to pick out the gentlest horses of the lot, and now
he was prepared to venture them in the harness where the lives of
ten persons or more would be dangled at their flying heels.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the day before the starting time, the only
child of Hubert Cosden, miner and millionaire extraordinary,
arrived in Munson. And Sammy, introducing himself to this
perishable creature for whom her father worried, was struck with
dismay.</p>

<p>"Into his hands," the charge had been given. And what a
charge!</p>

<p>She stood not half an inch shorter than Sammy. Her pompadoured
hair and a woman's carriage made her look a great deal larger than
he. She had, besides, a certain manner which made Sammy shrink in
self-esteem and importance.</p>

<p>But generalizations about Anne Cosden could never give more than
the vaguest idea about her. She had lived nineteen years and a few
months as the daughter of one of the rich and important men in the
country. She weighed a hundred and forty-five solid pounds. Her
foot took a woman's size number eight, made large in every
dimension. Her hand took a glove equally ample.</p>

<p>The hair of Anne Cosden was not of the kind which could be
softened with any pretty name. It was red&mdash;plain,
unadulterated red. It was flaring, flaming red. Brick red! And it
could not be disguised. There were silken tides and misty oceans of
it.</p>

<p>Beneath a low, broad brow, the brow of philosophers and prize
fighters, was set a pair of eyes to match the hair. Blue eyes, that
is to say. For all who have seen Irish red hair will know that
Irish blue eyes are needed. No, not Irish blue, for that is dark
and rich. But the blue of the eyes of Anne Cosden was pale, and
liable to take fire, just as her hair would take fire in the
sunlight.</p>

<p>She had a good square chin that would have taken a considerable
pounding without complaint. And there was a faint cleft in the
center of it. I do not know what a cleft in the chin is supposed to
mean. But the cleft in the chin of Anne Cosden meant something
ominous.</p>

<p>She was as straight as an arrow. And that is always a little
disconcerting in a woman, especially for a small man, like Sammy.
When he met her he tried to make the most of his inches. But he
felt that he was just about half a foot short of making any sort of
an impression on her.</p>

<p>She had an uncertain voice. That is to say, it was a voice with
one of those large, large ranges. And one never knew just what
section of her range she would choose to use. She had a gruff tone,
for instance, that was almost as deep as the voice of a man. And
she had a mellow midway tone in which she could talk and laugh and
sing, when she felt so inclined. And she had a higher register as
snarling and thin and edgy as the blast of a bugle. And she had,
also, a roar, a lion's roar. Or a lioness', if you please!</p>

<p>Yet she remained a girl. She was as distinctly feminine as she
was distinctly a "person." On the side of that leonine head there
was set an ear made of the most exquisite pale shell-pink and
ivory. Her hand had size enough and there were calluses on the
inside from driving and riding lunging thoroughbreds, but still it
was a long hand, made with consummate grace. And though she wore a
flat-heeled, blunt-nosed shoe, not even a blind man would have
taken that for a man's shoe.</p>

<p>The first thing that Anne Cosden did when she got to Munson was
to ask for a horse, because she wanted to have a look at the
country round, having been, as she said, entombed in a train longer
than she had ever been shut off from fresh air before. But when she
asked the hotel proprietor where she could get a horse, he rubbed
the stubble on his chin and announced that there were no ladies'
horses in that section of the country.</p>

<p>"Heavens, man," said Anne Cosden. "I've never ridden a lady's
horse in my life. Get me a man's horse. A man-sized horse,
too!"</p>

<p>The proprietor was a fellow with a mean disposition, and though
it is most generally understood that no Westerner will take
advantage of a lady, you can't count hotel proprietors as typical
of the land. He had a big rangy black, wild-caught, at four years
of age on the range. And as everybody knows, a horse which has run
wild on a Western range for four years is the devil's twin brother,
if not the devil himself!</p>

<p>However, the proprietor introduced her to the horse, and she
liked the looks of it so well that she bought it on the spot. And
the hotel man charged her a hundred dollars which, considering that
it had to be broken over again every day of its life, was robbery.
Five minutes later Anne Cosden was on the back of the black horse,
Charlie.</p>

<p>"I don't care what kind of saddle," she had said.</p>

<p>Five seconds later, Anne lay on her back in the dust of the
corral. And Charlie would have prepared her for her grave then and
there had she not recovered her wits soon enough to roll under the
lowest bar of the fence.</p>

<p>She picked herself up in sections, so to speak, and shook some
of the dust out of her hair, her hat was reposing in the corral,
and Charlie was busy doing to the hat the things he would have
liked to do to the mistress thereof.</p>

<p>But, a little later, Anne was in the saddle again. Three times
she mounted with some pain. Three times she was deposited in the
thick dust, but each time Charlie found the task of shedding her a
little harder. And, the fourth time, while half a dozen men stood
by in gaping wonder, Anne Cosden fairly rode the black out of his
bad graces and into his good ones.</p>

<p>Then she brought him up standing on the curb. She parted her
lips and the lion's voice roared forth: "Yank open that gate. I'm
going to give this little lamb some air!"</p>

<p>Five hours later she returned to Munson. When she dismounted it
was noticed that she walked with a limp; but so did Charlie.</p>

<p>"I had a bully ride, and it's a great country," said Anne
Cosden. "Did you know that Charlie could jump? Yes, a regular
fencer. I'm going to take him home and hunt him this fall. I don't
think he'll buck any more!"</p>

<p>And he didn't&mdash;never again!</p>

<p>Such was the Anne Cosden whom Sammy Gregg handed to a place in
the stage on this historic day, while the horses were being
harnessed in their places.</p>

<p>"I hope," said Anne Cosden, "that there are enough level places
for the horses to take a gallop now and then. This hot air needs to
be churned up a little!"</p>

<p>And a little dried-up man with far-away eyes murmured: "I don't
know that they'll wait for the level going, exactly!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch17" name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII. &mdash; THE FIRST
TRIP</h2>

<p class="first">In fact, those horses did not look to be the
waiting type as they were produced from the corral.</p>

<p>"Produced" is the word. They were not led forth, neither were
they driven. But, since men were plentiful in Munson, the wise old
driver distributed three or four men to every horse. And three or
four more or less expert wranglers can usually make the worst of
horses behave. Also, a half hitch taken in the long upper lip of a
mustang is apt to make him mind his manners for the time being. So,
pushed, dragged, and beaten into place, the horses were lined
up&mdash;the six safest horses in the possession of Sammy
Gregg.</p>

<p>The traces were hooked to the chains, and the chains to the
singletrees. The horses were straightened out. The leaders took up
the slack of the fifth chain. The swing pair leaned into the collar
to straighten the tongue of the wagon.</p>

<p>Alec gathered the six stout reins in his hands. He loosened the
long brake with his foot. He shook out the deadly length of his
whip, with which he could cut a horsefly off the hip of a leader
without touching the skin of the animal. "All right," said Alec.
"Yank off them blinds!" And the blindfolds were removed.</p>

<p>"Steady, boys!" said Alec gently. "Lean into them collars, pets.
Hey, you, Blackie! Git back onto your own feet. Now!"</p>

<p>The rest of Alec's language soared from the earth and took wings
to fiery regions. For the off leader saw something about the
make-up of the near leader which he did not like and at once he
proceeded, literally, to "climb his frame." He gathered himself and
tried to leap on top of his harness mate and bite the top of his
neck off at the same time.</p>

<p>The near leader, objecting, backed up to get out of the way and
jammed his rump into the nose of the near swing horse. And the near
swing horse, being a cannon that shot in one direction only,
resented this freedom by kicking the near wheeler in the nose.</p>

<p>Whereat the near wheeler jumped over the tongue and bit the
shoulder of the off wheeler, who planted his heels in the body of
the coach and then tried to jump through his collar. Which
disturbed the off swing, which, like a jack rabbit, turned end for
end in his harness to find out what the trouble was all about.</p>

<p>That was only the beginning of the affair! Little Sammy Gregg,
seeing six horses and his hopes of a fortune going to wrack,
uttered a shout which was almost a scream. And a stern voice behind
him rumbled:</p>

<p>"Keep quiet, little man. You'll scare the horses!"</p>

<p>He turned his head and had a vague glimpse of Anne Cosden. The
face of the millionaire's daughter was a study in contempt! But
Sammy, at that instant, did not care. He was merely thinking that
he had paid thirteen thousand dollars for the privilege of seeing
six mustangs kick a daydream into atoms and make a frontier town
dissolve in laughter.</p>

<p>However, they did not laugh themselves to helplessness. Before
the six mustangs had smashed each other to a pulp, a crowd of
staggering, shouting wranglers leaped at their heads. There was a
wild uproar. Presently six horses lay on the ground with their
heads pinned down under the weight of men.</p>

<p>In the tremulous silence which followed, Sammy announced in a
voice that fitted in with the pause: "I'm afraid we can't make the
start today, gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said the strong voice of Anne Cosden. "The fun is
barely starting, and none of us would miss the ride for a thousand
dollars!"</p>

<p>Two young men, who were about to slide over the back of the
coach and drop to safe terra firma, heard that calm announcement
and sneaked back into their places, where they sat quivering,
hoping that no one had seen them. And the rest of the passengers
began to lift their heads from their bristling coat collars and
look about as though wondering how they could still be intact.</p>

<p>Sammy was silenced, but his dismay was not the less. It was Alec
who spoke.</p>

<p>"The lady wants to go on with the party," said Alec. "Lemme get
down and see how many patches we'll have to make!"</p>

<p>There were not so very many, after all. One singletree, tough
hickory though it was, had been twisted neatly in two. And there
were some broken straps about the harness, here and there. However,
the omnipresent baling wire repaired those breakages, and presently
the horses were dragged to their feet. The broken singletree was
replaced.</p>

<p>"Hold hard," cautioned Alec. "I'm going to see if I can't scare
these boys into a little run."</p>

<p>So, when the blindfolds were removed, he whirled his whip,
cracked the long lash, scourged each of the six, apparently, with
one and the same movement of the lash, and uttered a ferocious
scream.</p>

<p>The six mustangs swung of one accord, curled like a snake,
caught the coach with an abrupt cross pull, and yanked it flat upon
its side.</p>

<p>Sammy Gregg, being the lightest missile, sailed the farthest. He
found himself pausing for an instant astraddle of the back of the
off leader. But from that point of vantage he was presently bucked
into space again and landed once more, this time in a group of
bystanders.</p>

<p>When his senses came back to him, he saw the fat man in whose
stomach his head had been buried, sitting with a stricken look
where he had fallen. The rest of the crowd was busy righting the
team and the coach. And the leader in the good work was Anne
Cosden.</p>

<p>Munson had wrecked the second hat which she had ventured to wear
there. It sat now, or a fragment of it sat, atilt on one side of
her head, and half of her bright red hair had slipped out and
tumbled down her back. But she held the refractory off leader
securely by the nose, twisting his upper lip until the agony made
him tame.</p>

<p>"The third go will bring us luck, boys!" sang out Anne Cosden.
"Drag out the baggage and heave the old wagon up on her legs once
more. There's enough of you to do it!"</p>

<p>There was not a member of the party, not even Alec, who would
not have relinquished all thoughts of the trip for that day, at the
least. But men cannot let women see the white feather in their
hats.</p>

<p>Sammy Gregg, shaken from his fall and weak-kneed with terror,
set doggedly about doing his share. And as he struggled with the
head of the near leader he heard her singing out encouragingly:
"Get him by the nose and twist!"</p>

<p>The near leader was pacified at last.</p>

<p>"That was a bad fall you got," said Anne Cosden good-naturedly.
"I thought you'd never stop sailing."</p>

<p>"Where were you to watch?"</p>

<p>"Sailing, too," replied Anne, grinning. "But I happened to land
in a thick spot of dust, so I'm all right; seems to have shaken you
up a bit, though."</p>

<p>"I'm not hurt," said Sammy, who believed in the truth. "But I'm
scared almost to death! And so are the rest of 'em except that
you've shamed them out of it!"</p>

<p>She looked at him in amazement. It was the first time in her
life that she had heard a man admit fear. And for that reason, I
suppose, she suddenly liked Sammy.</p>

<p>"You're the owner of this mess, aren't you?" said she.</p>

<p>"Yes, I put up for it."</p>

<p>"Cheer up," said Anne sympathetically. "A rainy morning makes a
good fox hunt. And we'll be in at the kill in Crumbock, after all.
There, they've got the coach up."</p>

<p>Thirty pairs of willing, heaving, struggling arms had managed
that trick, and the stage, stripped of baggage, was bolstered up,
then rocked suddenly into an erect position.</p>

<p>Once more, the baggage was piled in. The wan and silent
passengers, each with a covert eye upon this slave-driving girl,
climbed to their places. The blindfolds were snapped from the six
heads, and once more Alec rose to his task. A little streak of
crimson was dashed like war paint upon one cheek. He was covered
with dust, but covered with courage, also. And the terrible lash of
his whip cut a thin, deep gash in the hip of the boisterous off
leader.</p>

<p>That told the tale. With a wild snort, half grunt and half
neigh, that was a true stampede signal, the off leader hit his
collar with a weight that made the fifth chain groan, and the rest
of the clan, true to their breed, answered the stampede signal by
stretching their heads forth and striving to squeeze through their
collars.</p>

<p>In another instant the coach was shooting down the street of
Munson. The dust cloud rose high behind it. It swung out of sight,
cutting the first corner on two wheels, and the dust cloud, still
rising, spread broad, mothlike wings behind and still soared dimmer
and dimmer above the roofs of Munson.</p>

<p>"There'll be eleven dead men and one dead woman before that trip
is finished!" said Rendell.</p>

<p>"No," said another. "She'll get to Crumbock if she has to make
it riding bareback on that devil of an off leader." Which was the
general opinion in Munson.</p>

<p>But, in the meantime, the first mile of that journey was enough
to turn hair white, even on the head of a hero!</p>

<p>Six flying, straining wild horses whirled the stage over what
was called a road in that part of the country. There were lifting
rocks like great teeth ready to spike the stage as it passed. And
there were ruts eager to break wheels, and hummocks guaranteed to
overturn the wagon. But still Alec managed to shave the edge of
these dangers one after another until the first steep grade was
reached.</p>

<p>Then there was a different story. For behind the heels of the
wild horses there were two tons of weight, living and dead. A
trifle on the level, but a very great deal to whip up a sharp
gradient.</p>

<p>So the six slowed abruptly from a gallop to a trot, and from a
trot to a walk. And then they would willingly have stopped
altogether, but the whip in the hands of Alec was a sword of fire,
and when they tried to jump out of the way, their collars were
hands of steel. So the stage lurched heavily on its way.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch18" name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII. &mdash; THE
HOLDUP</h2>

<p class="first">But the six wild horses which were harnessed to
the stage at Munson were only the "pick of the whole lot!" There
were other sets to be hitched to the stage before it was rolled
into the dirty streets of Crumbock. And the other sets were a
sketchy lot, the first that came to hand at any of the stations of
relay along the way.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the stage on its first run was not on time.
They averaged exactly one hour of time to make each change of
horses. And, when the change was made there was a fearful rushing
through the hills! But still, the stage rolled on its way, and no
matter what else happened, it was not again overturned.</p>

<p>At two relay points from Munson they came to the rougher region
of mountains, and there, at the second relay from Munson, Sammy
Gregg had arranged an "escort of honor," so to speak. Because the
progress of this first stage through the mountains was apt to be a
dangerous affair.</p>

<p>The outlaw who first "stuck up" the new stage was apt to be
remembered long, and for that very reason, there was apt to be a
good deal of crowding for the post. In the stage itself there were
means of defense. In the first place, there was hardly a passenger,
outside of Sammy, who did not carry a gun, and most of them were
supposed to know how to use their weapons, while old Alec on the
driver's seat had a sawed-off shotgun hanging in a leather noose by
his leg. It was a monstrous old brute of a weapon, fit to have
served as an elephant gun, and in its two enormous barrels there
was poured a fair double handful of slugs of various sizes.</p>

<p>"From toothpicks to marbles," Alec was fond of saying, "this
here old gun don't much care what it shoots!"</p>

<p>That was not all. There were many valuables in the cargo aboard
that stage, and the temptation to stop it was apt to prove too much
for the gentlemen of the road. So, at the second relay, Sammy had
hired two men of wide repute for their skill with shooting irons of
all kinds.</p>

<p>Lester and Andrew Gunn were men who had stayed within the limits
of the "law" for only one good reason, which was that the law had
never happened to be looking very hard their way during certain
interesting moments in their lives. Ten years before, they were in
the way to making quite a reputation for themselves and decorating
the noose of a lynching party's rope some day, when a certain
famous sheriff took the trouble to read them a lecture on the law,
its ways and means. They took that lecture so much to heart, that
they had decided upon the spot to follow his good advice, and from
that time forth, they became strict adherents to the party of
peace.</p>

<p>But they could shoot just as straight as ever, and at various
times, always side by side in every pinch, they had demonstrated
their willingness to support the nearest sheriff as deputies. Such
men were sure to be known and dreaded. And so, by reputation, they
had become known to Sammy Gregg.</p>

<p>You may be sure that he did not hire them because he liked them.
There was not a man in the mountains, for that matter, who would
have owned himself a friend to the Gunn brothers. Their narrow,
swarthy faces and little animal-like black eyes warned all
beholders that they were brutes of the lowest type, without nerves
or conscience to trouble them. They looked, in short, exactly what
they were: hired gunfighters.</p>

<p>Even the steady composure of Anne Cosden was shaken not a little
when she was told that this dismal couple was to act as guards to
the stage. But they jogged on ahead of the coach and most of the
time they did not spoil the view with their presence. They were
always just around the next curve of the trail which the freighters
had carved deep, even in the rocks. A very efficient couple, no
doubt, and their services for this single day had cost Sammy Gregg
fifty heart-felt dollars.</p>

<p>"For one day?" he had cried at them in surprise.</p>

<p>"You never can tell," said Lester Gunn. "It might be our last
day. And a gent's last day is worth something extra for funeral
expenses, you might say."</p>

<p>That grim joke settled the question.</p>

<p>"If some one tackles them, we hear the trouble and can get
ready," Sammy explained to Miss Cosden, "and if they tackle us
first, the Gunn brothers will hear the racket and they can come
back to us. You see, it works both ways."</p>

<p>Miss Cosden looked him fairly in the eye. "Yes," said she, "if
all the men on the stage are willing to fight!"</p>

<p>Sammy turned a bright crimson. But his eye did not flinch from
hers. "I'm no hero," he said. "And I don't know anything about
guns. But the other men on the stage have weapons and they can use
them well enough."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "I don't know," said Anne Cosden,
"but I've heard that a rifle has a very quieting effect if the man
behind it has the drop. However, we won't have any trouble. The old
days of road agents are done with. This is modern life!"</p>

<p>It is usually that way. All evil belongs to the dark days of the
past. The present lies in a white sunlight of innocence and freedom
from wrong.</p>

<p>The afternoon wore out. The sun was no longer an intolerable
lump of white fire. It was a dazzling golden ball dropping little
by little toward the blue tops of the western peaks. A little more,
and the evening was coming on them.</p>

<p>Have you seen the evening come over the mountains, ever? It is a
thing to see and never to forget. For in the mountains, the evening
seems to come in two ways. First, it is cropping out of the sky.
Secondly, it is rising out of the deep valleys like a dark, cool
mist.</p>

<p>Every time the stage dipped into a hollow the world seemed
already more than half lost to the night; and every time it rocked
up onto a high point, the world seemed saved to a beautiful part of
the day, still. So they wavered up and down the trail, between
darkness and light.</p>

<p>It was as the stage mounted to the top of one of these many
knolls that Andrew Gunn was heard to cry out in a sharp, snarling
voice, and then there was a loud, rapid blur of shots. Just an
instant of gunfire, you understand, a single second packed with the
crackle of musketry.</p>

<p>And then a dizzying silence.</p>

<p>"Jiminy!" grinned old Alec, as his hand relaxed from the reins
which he had begun to draw taut, and as he lowered again the
terrible muzzle of the sawed-off shotgun which he had jerked up at
the first alarm. "I thought for just a minute that it wasbut I
suppose the boys just seen a rabbit or something like&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then Sammy, looking half-worried ahead of the nodding ears
of the leaders of the stage, saw a beautiful big gray horse covered
with a mottling of large dapples step into view around that corner
of the road where the Gunn brothers had disappeared. And next he
saw big Chester Ormonde Furness.</p>

<p>There was no mask upon Furness this time. Perhaps he had decided
that he and his horse and his ways were becoming so well known that
it was useless to try the masking game anymore. Perhaps he was
tired of it. Perhaps, and this indeed the most likely of all, he
simply wanted a new thrill and therefore he was letting himself be
identified with that sort of a crime which hangs the criminal when
he is caught. The old way was so safe, so dull, that it would not
serve any longer.</p>

<p>But, most significant detail of all, and the first detail for
everyone on that stagecoach to see, there was a beautiful,
long-barreled repeating rifle cuddled into the hollow of the
shoulder of Mr. Furness and his head was leaned a little to one
side, as though he were whispering loving words to the breech of
his gun. He was steady as a veritable rock. There was not a glimmer
of waving light as the barrel of that gun steadied upon the top of
the stagecoach.</p>

<p>Those practiced eyes which beheld this tableau understood the
meaning of that steadiness. Instantly there was a forest of arms
upon the top of the vehicle, a stiff-standing forest raised just as
high as possible above the heads of the travelers, and the arms of
Sammy Gregg were almost the first up.</p>

<p>Even old Alec knew that he had been beaten at last, and he did
not more than half raise the shotgun which was his pride. Instead,
he let the muzzle sink by degrees while he moaned: "Oh, my Lord, if
I'd only taken the first think more seriousif I'd only played that
first hunch, the first hunch always bein' the only good one when it
comes to guns."</p>

<p>The last part of this remark was torn from his lips, so to
speak, by the explosion of a revolver just behind his head. For
there was one person in the stage who had not thrust up hands at
the summons. And now there was one revolver leveled at big,
handsome Chester Furness. Not a big black Colt .45. This was a more
refined pistol with a pearl pair of handles, and a beautifully
burnished octagonal-barrel .32-caliber gun.</p>

<p>"One of them kind that pricks you pretty bad, but mostly never
does no killin' "as a Westerner would have expressed it.</p>

<p>Now, however, this little .32 was thrust out and twice it
exploded. And the broad-brimmed hat leaped from the head of Furness
and exposed his fine features to the fight of the late day. She had
shot the sombrero fairly from its place!</p>

<p>Then one of Gregg's hands descended, brutally hard, and the
thin, hard edge of his palm struck her wrist and turned all the
nerves in her hand dead, and made the six-shooter and its four
unfired bullets drop into the dust.</p>

<p>"You idiot!" cried the girl to him. "How did you dare?"</p>

<p>She did not complete the sentence. For just then big Furness
spoke, and the sound of his voice made all other things seem
unimportant.</p>

<p>"Madame," said he, "I thought you were about to do a murder, but
I'm glad that it is not to be on your conscience. Thank you,
Sammy!"</p>

<p>Cool? Yes, it was very cool, and he looked fully as calm as his
words, and about ten times handsomer and bigger and stronger and
more deadly than anything that had ever come across the path of
anyone in that stage, including Miss Anne Cosden among the
rest.</p>

<p>His gun, you see, had not wavered for an instant. And yet
neither of her bullets had missed him. Her second shot, obviously,
had torn the hat from his head. And now it was seen that her first
slug had touched his cheek. Which, when you come down to it, is not
half-bad practice for a girl doing snapshooting from the wavering
top of a big, lumbering stage!</p>

<p>One could not tell how badly he was hurt. Just scratched,
perhaps. But there was a visible stream of crimson working its way
down the side of his face. It was a staggering thing to her. It was
even more staggering to the rest of the men on the coach, for they
all had heard of this man and most of them had seen him. There had
been talk about him, rather naturally, during this very journey
toward the hills.</p>

<p>Yes, it took the breath from every man on the stage, and it took
the breath of Anne Cosden's own fierce self, the moment she heard
him speak. I suppose it made it a little more poignant to her, the
fact that he spoke in a pure grammar with the voice of a cultivated
man. He was one of her own class. A villain, beyond the slightest
shadow of a doubt, he was nevertheless a gentleman and a hero as
well. He had just demonstrated that fact twice over!</p>

<p>Anne Cosden sunk into her place, and she was trembling. Almost
for the first time in her life she was trembling. And it was fear,
too, that made her tremble, not the thought that she had almost
taken this man's life. Indeed, I think there was a hot wish in her
heart that she had killed him. Because now he had filled her with a
chilly dread unlike anything she had ever dreamed of before. She
leaned a little forward, gaping at him in a most unromantic and
ungraceful way, and the beauty of that fine face and head of his
sank upon her eyes and upon her heart, and his smile and the dark
shining of his eyes as he looked up to her and the quiet music of
his voice.</p>

<p>Yes, she wished that one of those bullets had gone a little
lower, or a little more to one side. Poor Anne Cosden!</p>

<p>Then, from beyond the curve of the road, for the first time, she
and the rest heard a low-pitched, stifled groaning. Not one voice,
but twothe sick, weak, bubbling groaning of a very badly wounded
man.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard that sound? It will make a hospital ward
turn pea-green in an instant; it makes even a doctor need a drink.
And it drained the very last thought of resistance, if they had any
in the first place, out of the systems of the men in that
stage.</p>

<p>They obeyed in the most perfectly regular fashion, doing as he
directed them to do. They climbed down to the road and stood there
in the gathering chill of the evening, listening!</p>

<p>He said to the girl, as she got to the ground, "Will you run to
take a look at those two poor fellows? I don't think they're as
badly hit as they sound!"</p>

<p>She gave him a nod. And as she went by he trailed his glance
quietly over her and her eyes went wide under the touch of his, and
how far he looked into her heart she dared not guess. But she ran
down the road, and there she found her hands filled with
work&mdash;gruesome work enough, at that!</p>

<p>Mr. Furness carried his rifle carelessly tucked under one arm.
And yet it was held as lightly and as firmly and as surely, it
seemed, as though he had gripped it in both strong hands. Also, his
right forefinger was curled constantly about the trigger, and
everyone in the group knew perfectly well that that finger was not
there for nothing.</p>

<p>He lined them up with their faces to the side of the road. Then
he went behind them and "frisked" their pockets. A neat little haul
even for a Furness. Not so much as he would have taken, you would
think, from a crowd coming back from the mines. But, as a matter of
fact, there were no fewer than three professional gamblers in that
shipment, and from them alone, on their way to work the rich gold
diggings in their own peculiar fashion, he took more than fourteen
thousand dollars in cash. There was that much more taken from the
rest of the group. And now he paused behind Sammy Gregg.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said he, "that you have a pretty considerable wad
of money in your pocket, for a payroll, and what not. But I really
don't see how I can take from a man who brings me so many excellent
customers. It would hardly be considered good etiquette on the
road, do you think?"</p>

<p>He laughed, did Mr. Furness, and swung onto his gray horse with
a movement so swift that even if they had had eyes in the backs of
their heads, they would hardly have been able to seize the right
moment to whirl and shoot. Also, their guns had been thrown in the
middle of the road by his foresight!</p>

<p>Then he backed his gray stallion up the road. How beautiful and
proudly disdainful that glorious creature seemed as he pranced in
that fashion, backward, obeying the will of his master, but not his
hand.</p>

<p>"After I am around the corner, it will be safe for you to move,
but not before, if you please. And remember, my friends, that this
is a rifle which I carry under my arm, not a revolver, you know. So
if you want to hunt me up, don't tread too close upon my heels,
because you might have your toes barked!"</p>

<p>Then, there he was at the corner, and around it in a flash with
the big horse.</p>

<p>He paused beside the girl. And she was a changed sight. She was
dabbled with crimson from head to foot, and she was quite white
with the sight of so much of it. But she stuck to her work. Good
work, too. It pays those who hunt and ride to understand first aid,
and Anne Cosden had learned her lesson well. She was making every
touch count, and every touch was dragging those two wretches
farther and farther from the shadow of death.</p>

<p>Yes, there was Andrew already bandaged. The deadly running of
the crimson had been stopped. But still his eyes were closed and
his pale forehead as it had been when he felt the strength of his
life leaking swiftly out from him, ebbing away in great pulses. And
now Lester Gunn was being saved.</p>

<p>Furness stooped from the saddle above her. And he saw her shrink
and shudder beneath the sense of his nearness. He undid with the
deft tips of his fingers a clasp that secured a delicate little
gold chain around her neck. There was only a little ornamental
locket at the end of it. And she, with both her hands employed,
merely said without raising her head:</p>

<p>"It's worth nothing in money. I'll pay you to leave that with
me, Mr. Furness."</p>

<p>"I have to have it," said he. "I don't know just what it may
mean to you, but I'm certain that it can't mean so much to you as
it does to me."</p>

<p>Only that, and then the stinging dust spurned into a cloud
before her face as the stallion's hooves bit strongly at the road
and shot him away at full speed from that standing start, away down
the road, swiftly, swiftly. And, from the corner, a crackling of
guns to pursue him.</p>

<p>She paid no heed to those guns. She did not even look up to see
the result, for she knew he was safe. No man such as those in that
stage could touch the life of this hero of the mountains, for she
felt that he controlled his own destiny as surely as though it lay
in the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>They left the Gunn brothers there by the roadside. Two men
volunteered to stay with them as nurses. Bedding was placed for
them, and provisions, and the promise given that more help would be
rushed back from the next relay station, only three miles away. And
so the stage rolled on.</p>

<p>But Anne Cosden, sitting with bowed head, paid no heed even now
to the terrible red stains on her clothes. But she rubbed slowly,
patiently, a red mark upon her wrist. It was where the edge of the
palm of little Sammy Gregg had struck her.</p>

<p>He, sitting beside her, could not help noticing. And he said
softly, at last: "I'm sorry. I needn't have hit you so hard, I
suppose."</p>

<p>She raised blank eyes to him. It was as though he were miles
away and she were staring to find a trace of him and his
meaning.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Anne Cosden, "I wasn't thinking of that!"</p>

<p>What was she thinking of? Sammy Gregg was not a fool, and now he
had something unusual working in his heart and head to stimulate
him, so that he guessed well enough what it was. For there was
everything about big Furness to make him a woman's hero, thought
Sammy. Size, courage, and that wonderful beauty of face, and above
all the strangeness of soul in which he was wrapped.</p>

<p>What, in contrast, was there in such a man as Sammy himself, and
his wretched inches, and his starved body, and his unheroic
soul?</p>

<p>She need not have said any more, for Sammy was already perfectly
convinced. But how was she, being what she was, apt to guess that
this small creature was following the windings of her soul? So she
said aloud, but more to herself than to him:</p>

<p>"No, I'm glad that you thought quickly enough to strike my hand
down. Otherwise I might have killed him. Think of it!"</p>

<p>Was not Sammy thinking?</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch19" name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX. &mdash; DOWN ON HIS
LUCK</h2>

<p class="first">If anyone could have said to Sammy Gregg that
there could have come into his life, on that day, a thing greater
than the stage line, he would have laughed them to scorn. But
before they reached Crumbock on the next day, close to midnight,
Sammy had been forced to confess to his heart of hearts that he
loved that big, noisy, stalwart Anne Cosden more than he loved any
other thing in the world. More, even, than he cared for the stage
line and its success!</p>

<p>Of course, it was a wretched confession to make, because he knew
he had never a chance of winning her. He was ashamed of himself for
being so absurd as to desire her, and he hoped, in his shrinking
heart of hearts, that no one would ever guess at his secret. He had
a miserable sense of guilt, when he saw big Hubert Cosden meet his
daughter when the stage arrived under the big lanterns which
illumined Sammy's Crumbock terminal.</p>

<p>What if she should tell her father something of the things that
had happened during the ride&mdash;no, not the ridiculous maneuvers
at the start, but what had gone on inside her spirit when she sat
on the top of the coach and looked down to the handsome face of big
Chester Ormonde Furness?</p>

<p>However, there was some spark of joy for him. And that was the
furor which Crumbock raised over him and his stage. To be sure, it
was just half a day late, and it had been robbed on the way. But
those, they assured him, were unlucky incidents which might happen
to anyone!</p>

<p>Sammy stayed in Crumbock for a while. He told himself,
miserably, that it was because he wanted to work up the business at
that most important end of the line, as though business needed any
working up! But, in reality, he knew that it was because he wanted
to be close to Anne Cosden.</p>

<p>In a week, the four coaches were working steadily, and all the
three hundred horses were being worked in turn. Aye, and a hurry
call was sent to Gonzalez for more. And the dollars began to flow
steadily into the pockets of Sammy, where they were needed so
much.</p>

<p>In the first seven days, he cleared six thousand dollars, which
gave some idea of how badly that stage line was needed at Crumbock.
And during that first week nothing went wrong. There was not a
single holdup. There was not so much as a broken axle. Even the
terrible mustangs from the southland, once they had had a single
turn at the work, became a smaller nuisance. Their deviltry was
exhausted by their work, just as it should have been.</p>

<p>On the eighth day there was the first sign of impending trouble.
The northbound stage rolled into Crumbock bearing two extra
passengers, in the form of the bodies of two would-be stage
robbers.</p>

<p>It was old Alec and his sawed-off shotgun, again. The old fellow
was so proud of himself and his gun that he couldn't help telling
over and over again how it happened.</p>

<p>And on the very next day he insisted on driving the stage back
again instead of taking his layoff.</p>

<p>"You got to have one man," said Uncle Alec, "that's able to
bring these here stages through all safe. And I reckon that I'm
just about that man!"</p>

<p>Poor Uncle Alec!</p>

<p>He got just three miles outside of Crumbock, hardly over the
first rising range to the south, when a familiar form on a glorious
dappled stallion rode out before the coach, a rifle at the ready.
Uncle Alec reached for the mighty cannon, but as his hand fell on
it, a bullet tore through his shoulder.</p>

<p>Mr. Furness lined up the passengers beside the road once more.
He himself paused to give kind words to Alec.</p>

<p>"But, after all," said Furness in conclusion, "you're a little
too old to be playing a hand in this game."</p>

<p>But the loss of Uncle Alec was only one thing.</p>

<p>In that stage there was the first shipment of gold that had been
entrusted to the new line. Fifty pounds of dust, or more than
sixteen thousand dollars in value. And it was lost with the rest of
the plunder. How much was taken from the belts of the men no one
could more than guess, for each one put a pretty high estimate on
his losses.</p>

<p>However, it was a pretty bad loss to the miners, and it hit the
reputation of the stage line pretty hard. One robbery was to be
expected. It gave expectation and spice to a ride over the line,
one might say, but two robberies, and a third attempted, all within
the space of eight days, was a little too much! There was a lot of
disagreeable talk in Crumbock, and Sammy knew from afar that the
same sort of talk was going the rounds in Munson.</p>

<p>Yet the patronage of the line did not fall off. Men still bought
tickets, but they bought them with doubtful frowns, and the
doubtful frowns were still worn all the way to the end of the
trail.</p>

<p>On the tenth day three worthies attempted to stop the southbound
coach. They were armed with rifles, and they "got the drop." But it
happened that that stage was crammed with a dozen young men who had
not filled their pockets with gold at Crumbock. They had lost their
money, but they had not lost their desire for adventure.</p>

<p>When they saw the morning sun turning the barrels of those three
rifles to diamonds, and when they heard the three youths in the
road singing out, the men in the stage simply reached for their own
guns.</p>

<p>Four of them were badly wounded, but the three in the road were
shot down, also. Two were killed. Another was taken to the next
relay station, where he recuperated, and then escaped. But it was
felt that this adventure might discourage further attempts upon the
line.</p>

<p>No, for the next day, the eleventh since the line was put in
operation, the rider on the gray stallion appeared in the road and
took the southbound coach almost exactly at the spot where the
three desperadoes had appeared before.</p>

<p>It was plain that he was saying to the world: "What three cannot
do when they don't know how is ridiculously simple, if one simply
understands how to go about the thing."</p>

<p>For his part, he understood, and since the shooting of the two
Gunn brothers and the bullet through the shoulder of famous Uncle
Alec, resistance to the marauder was unpopular. He had taken three
stages, now, and the men in Crumbock said: "He's got enough to
retire on, unless he's in this game for fun!"</p>

<p>However that might be, they were not willing to take the chance
anymore. Could they be blamed? There had been five attempts at
robbery within eleven days. Three of them had succeeded, and in one
of the failures, four of the passengers in the coach had been
wounded as they had fought off the robbers.</p>

<p>The Western mind was made up with Western suddenness and Western
thoroughness. The stage line to Munson was unsafe, and instantly no
one would take a passage on it, except men who had not a penny to
their names. They went gladly enough.</p>

<p>Sammy, in despair, waited for three days and then announced the
"excursion" rates, cutting the fare fairly in two. But still no one
was willing to ride, and the receipts had fallen away to zero.</p>

<p>"There ain't nothin' wrong with the fare, Gregg," said one
old-timer. "It's the weather that you furnish along the road that
makes us hold back. You give us too much scenery!"</p>

<p>Sammy grew hollow-eyed, nervous. The days were long nightmares
to him. And so dull had grown the wits of Sammy that when he
encountered a certain young man on the long, winding street of
Crumbock, he did not recognize that face, though it had played a
most important part in the life of Sammy, you may be sure, and the
stranger had to walk up to him and slap him twice upon the shoulder
before Sammy rubbed his eyes and looked up from his daydream of
misery.</p>

<p>He saw a handsome youth before him, a slender, willowy figure of
a man with soft, lazy brown eyes, and a cigarette, rolled Mexican
style, dangling from his finger.</p>

<p>"Jeremy Major!" said Sammy.</p>

<p>"You look sick," said Jeremy. "I'm coming to see you tonight.
Start thinking for me. I'm terribly bored!"</p>

<p>Jeremy Major walked on down the street&mdash;for he seemed to be
busy following a tall man in a white sombrero&mdash;and Sammy
turned to stare hungrily after him.</p>

<p>Sammy was walking on, when a boy brought him a message from
Hubert Cosden. Sammy found him sitting on his buckboard in front of
a powder store. Mr. Cosden began with Sammy by apologizing for
sending for him. However, there was on the mind of the millionaire
a weight so heavy that he had to get it off at once.</p>

<p>"What do you know about this man Furness?" asked Cosden.</p>

<p>"I know about as much as most people do," said Sammy. "I arrived
from the East on the same train that brought him. I saw him bullied
by the first and last crowd that will ever try that trick on him. I
saw him shoot the first man he killed in Munson. And I had a herd
of two hundred broncos swiped by him, and I had him sass me to my
face about the mustangs. I've seen him right from the start, so far
as this part of the country knows him. What do you want to know
about him?"</p>

<p>"You're an intelligent man, Gregg. You wouldn't let personal
injuries prejudice you too much. Now, personally I know nothing
about this fellow at all. I want to ask your opinion: Do you think
that there's a shadow of a reason to hope that he might ever go
straight?"</p>

<p>There was something about the urgent tone in which this was
asked that made Sammy suspect that Mr. Cosden wished him to say
"Yes." And so he answered:</p>

<p>"He's not a boy, and he wasn't a boy when he started in at
Munson."</p>

<p>"Nobody likes a man without some spirit," said Mr. Cosden. "And
nobody likes a man who won't fight."</p>

<p>Sammy smiled.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Cosden sharply.</p>

<p>"Nothing. Except that I think you're answering your own
questions, Mr. Cosden. Nobody wants a coward; but nobody really
wants a thief and a murderer!"</p>

<p>"Murderer? Murderer?" cried Mr. Cosden. "Isn't that a very
strong word to use? Has it ever been proved that Mr. Furness has
ever taken a human life unless in self-defense?"</p>

<p>"I don't suppose it has," said Sammy. "But, you see, the trouble
is that he's had to defend himself so often!"</p>

<p>Mr. Cosden was gloomily silent and Sammy drove home the point.
"You'd think," said Sammy Gregg, "that once a man got the
reputation that this Furness has, he'd have no trouble. People
would dodge him like fire or poison. But that doesn't seem to be
the way of it. Poor Furness is being hounded all the time by
bullies and gun-fighters, and he has to keep on killing people in
self-defense&mdash;guards of stages, for instance, that he's about
to hold up."</p>

<p>Mr. Cosden, turning very red, raised his hand. "That's enough,"
said he. I suppose I understand the rest of what you have to say,
and I suppose I have to agree with it! And yet, confound it, one
cannot help hoping that these strong young men&mdash;there's a lack
of strong men in this world of ours, Gregg!"</p>

<p>Sammy Gregg blinked and nodded.</p>

<p>"Although," qualified burly Mr. Cosden in haste, "there are
several kinds of strength&mdash;physical, mental, and all that, I
am very well aware."</p>

<p>But Sammy smiled, as one who would say: "I am not proud, even
when you step on my corns!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Cosden, "the idea just hopped into my head. But
you're right, I suppose. Yes, of course you're right. The fellow is
a rascal!" A mild name for the deeds of Mr. Furness, to be
sure.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Sammy good-naturedly, as he turned
away. "I don't blame you for wanting to know about him."</p>

<p>He could have bitten out his tongue, the instant he had said
that, and so he turned away hastily, hoping that what he had said
in parting would not be noticed.</p>

<p>He got two strides away and then a ringing voice blasted after
him: "Gregg!"</p>

<p>He whirled around as though he had been shot. His face was
burning, and so was the face of Mr. Cosden. Mutually they read the
thoughts of one another and grew redder still.</p>

<p>"Gregg," said Cosden more gently, "I've got to know what you
mean by that!"</p>

<p>"Why," lied Sammy gallantly, "nothing, of course. But everybody
in the town is interested in the man who's held up three
stages."</p>

<p>Mr. Cosden shook his head. "Well done, Sammy," said he, "but it
won't do! No, you had a particular thought in mind when you said
that. Confess what it was!"</p>

<p>"Why," said Sammy, "there's no law against guessing, is
there?"</p>

<p>"I suppose not. But, what is your guess?"</p>

<p>"Miss Cosden."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!"</p>

<p>"Only a guess, and it's legal to take a guess, Mr. Cosden."</p>

<p>"Does the whole town know?" gasped Cosden miserably.</p>

<p>"Nobody dreams of it!" said Sammy.</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was sitting in the seat beside her, when the stage was
stopped by&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you did your guessing then!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You are a good guesser, Gregg," said the older man gloomily.
"And at that rate, you ought to make a success on the Street. You
could read the minds of the stocks. You guessed, but you said
nothing to me!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Cosden, you wouldn't have believed me. And it was none of
my business to guess out loud!"</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>"The first I knew of it was last night. The scoundrel sneaked
down to the town, and I actually found him as big as life in my
house talking to my girl. I came in and took them unawares. He was
as cool as the devil. I half think that he is the devil! And of
course there's no nerves in Anne. I had a fine talk with them, you
may be sure. And for all I know, Anne may be riding away over the
edge of the world with him at this moment&mdash;curse me for a
talking idiot&mdash;why am I telling you all of this?"</p>

<p>"I could guess," said Sammy, very white and sick of face.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be done," said Mr. Cosden gravely. "All I
can do is to wait and pray that she will have good sense and do
nothing rash. But if I oppose her&mdash;ah, Gregg, if only we could
find a way of killing him off to save her!"</p>

<p>"He has a habit of defending himself," said Sammy.</p>

<p>"I know that. But surely there must be in the world some man or
men able to fight fire with fire."</p>

<p>Then the great thought struck Sammy.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch20" name="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX. &mdash; A TALK WITH
JEREMY</h2>

<p class="first">One hunts for opposites as antidotes&mdash;the fat
to counteract the acid, the boxer to beat the slugger, the bird to
kill the serpent. And so Sammy, thinking of the big shoulders and
the heavy body of handsome Chester Furness, naturally and
instinctively turned in his mind toward the opposite of so much
brute force and what he thought of was the slender, supple body of
young Jeremy Major.</p>

<p>Not that one thought of Jeremy Major as being young, any more
than one thinks of a statue of a youth as being young. It may date
from the fifth century, B. C.! And so with Jeremy, he simply was,
he existed as fire exists, without an age.</p>

<p>Thinking of him, it seemed to Sammy that he had the solution.
And suddenly he began to chuckle.</p>

<p>"Has it turned into a laughing matter?" asked Mr. Cosden
bitterly. "Is it worth no more serious thought than this?"</p>

<p>"I was only wondering what would happen when they meet!" said
Sammy.</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Cosden.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see an old cat tackle a dog in earnest?" asked
Sammy rather dreamily.</p>

<p>Mr. Cosden gaped; he felt that the youth was possibly taking
leave of his good wits.</p>

<p>"Well," went on Sammy, "he's like that. Only bigger. And not a
house cat. No, because he's wild from the heart out!"</p>

<p>"Who? Who under heaven?" cried Mr. Cosden. "Who is wild, and
what difference does it make to me?"</p>

<p>"The man who will beat big Mr. Furness for you, I think," said
Sammy.</p>

<p>Mr. Cosden showed signs of interest at once.</p>

<p>"Tell me about him!" said he. "Is he another one of these men
who have to defend themselves often?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Sammy. "It doesn't happen very often. He'll duck
out of the way of trouble, you see, the way a jack rabbit will
double away from a dog. Trouble doesn't get him into a corner very
often, but when it does&mdash;" He paused significantly.</p>

<p>"Some honest, honorable fellow?" asked Cosden.</p>

<p>"A crooked gambler," said Sammy, "when he meets other crooked
ones. A loafer who never did a lick of work in his life. A
good-for-nothing tramp, king and spendthrift. That's all you can
say for him, logically."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Cosden. "If it's matching one of that kind
against the big fellow, I suppose I may call it fighting fire with
fire. It doesn't make much difference which of them goes down. The
world will be benefited by it."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Sammy, "there's no doubt about who'll go down. No
doubt about that at all!"</p>

<p>"Is this friend of yours such a terrible fighter?"</p>

<p>"He's terrible enough. I never saw him fight. But I know about
him! The only trouble will be about getting him to take the
job."</p>

<p>"If that is all," said Mr. Cosden, "then we can stop worrying.
Money is no object to me in a matter like this. If it will bring my
girl over the rocks safely, I'll spend it like water. You yourself,
Gregg, hire him and promise him anything you like. If he wants an
advance&mdash;that sort of a man usually does&mdash;tell him to
name his own figure."</p>

<p>Sammy shook his head. "Money will never turn the trick," said
he. "Never in the world. Money isn't what you want. He's had as
much money in his hands as you've had, I suppose. Millions must
have drifted through him at the gaming tables. But it's dirt to
him. It's water to him. He's thrown it away. Given it away. No,
money will never tempt him."</p>

<p>"The devil take him! This fellow seems to be a freak! What will
bring him, then?"</p>

<p>"Partly because he's getting bored."</p>

<p>"He won't do a killing for money, but he might do it for
pleasure?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"A pleasant man!" shuddered Cosden.</p>

<p>"But I think," said Sammy, "that the only way to go about it is
for you to hunt him out and tell him the truth."</p>

<p>"The truth&mdash;Gregg, are you quite mad? The truth to such a
fellow?"</p>

<p>"It would be safer with him than with me or you!" said
Sammy.</p>

<p>Mr. Cosden threw up his hands. "I give it up," said he.
"Everything that you say about this fellow is at outs with
everything else you say. He seems to be made up of nothing but
opposites."</p>

<p>"That," said Sammy, "is exactly what he is!"</p>

<p>So it was that Mr. Cosden, the millionaire, went down the street
with Sammy and found the goal of his search in a gaming room,
sitting idly on a bench at the side of the room. And a big, bearded
fellow beside him was pouring forth a tale of hard luck.</p>

<p>"Look here," Cosden heard the youth break in upon the miner,
"what would it cost you to tackle that job again, with the right
sort of help?"</p>

<p>"Here's millions lyin' idle, goin' to waste, because there ain't
nothin' legitimate to put 'em into. But fifteen hundred would stake
me. But can I get anybody to give my idea a try?"</p>

<p>"Here," said slender Mr. Major, "is the fifteen hundred and a
little extra. So long. Run along. I don't want your thanks. Never
mind the contract. Your word suits me. I don't want a
witness&mdash;goodby!" And so he fairly pushed the man away and the
prospector ran, red-eyed and joyous, into the street.</p>

<p>"And he's not a fool?" asked Cosden.</p>

<p>"It looks that way, but he's not. Here, I'll introduce you."</p>

<p>Men did not take long to get down to even the most important
business in those days in the West. Mr. Cosden found himself taking
a hand no larger and just as soft as the hand of his daughter,
Anne. He found himself looking down into dark, melancholy brown
eyes. Then he was walking forth in the street with Mr. Jeremy Major
at his side. Gregg had gone off and left them to their own
devices.</p>

<p>It was a very hard story to tell, but then the need behind it
was very great, and Mr. Cosden brought out the tale haltingly,
stiffly. When he finished, Jeremy Major made a brief "sum."</p>

<p>"This fellow Furness you think needs killing, and I'm to do the
job. Partly for any sum I want to name and partly as a soil of a
public benefaction."</p>

<p>That summed it up neatly enough, and Mr. Cosden smiled and
nodded.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jeremy, "I'm not a public benefactor. And I never
was. And, in the next place, I am not so sure that your daughter is
worth all this fuss. I don't want to hurt your feelings. But I
might as well tell you right now, to begin with, that the only
person I'd tackle big Furness for is the lady herself."</p>

<p>It was rather bold talk&mdash;much bolder, at least, than Mr.
Cosden was accustomed to hearing. But there was really nothing for
him to do except to bear it as best he might.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said he patiently, "that the thing for me to do is
to take you home and introduce you to my daughter?"</p>

<p>"It won't do at all," replied this calmly self-assured Mr.
Major. "She's a rough sort, and hard to know. Of course I've seen
her. Everybody has seen her riding that black horse that she
brought on from Munson. But one doesn't feel like tackling Furness
for the sake of a girl that seems to care about nothing in the
world except the highest fence that she can jump her horse over.
Suppose you get short of help in your house and suppose you give me
a job, something sort of easy, if you don't mind. Because it kills
me to work!"</p>

<p>Mr. Cosden smiled grimly at the thought of the gunfighter
trembling over the prospect of work. And yet, in spite of himself,
he could not help wondering if Sammy Gregg had not been covertly
amusing himself in presenting this fellow to him as a destroyer of
men.</p>

<p>"You can do what you like," said he. "Pick out any kind of job
around the house that you want to. My cook quit this morning, and
my daughter is doing the cooking and the rest of the work. Which is
plenty, because we have to feed eight men!"</p>

<p>Mr. Major writhed at the thought. "Eight men!" sighed he. "And
this sort of weather!" He glanced deprecatingly up at the blazing
sun. "Well," said he, "I'll tell you how it is&mdash;work doesn't
agree with me, somehow. I have bad nerves, d'you see? And work
interferes with them a surprising lot!"</p>

<p>"Name what you please," said Cosden. "Or, if you want, I'll
bring you up there as a visitor or a driller waiting for
a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Could you do that?" said Jeremy, brightening. "But, no, I
should be working. Working, so that I'll have a chance to talk to
her. I'll tell you, washing dishes is about my speed, if you have a
good airy kitchen with plenty of windows and doors to it. Or
chopping the kindling wood, maybe. I wouldn't mind that sort of
work."</p>

<p>"Young man," returned Cosden, "will you tell me how you ever
managed to get along as a boy, or were there no chores around your
house?"</p>

<p>"There were chores," said Jeremy, with a pained sigh of
recollection. "And there was a stepmother who had a special talent
for getting those chores done by her stepsons. But somehow, after
she had tried me out on the jobs for a long time, somehow she came
to decide that maybe it was better for someone else to do the work,
because I was so clumsy that I was always breaking something and
after a while, there wasn't much work for me to do, and I was
raised easy. But it took a lot of thinking, always, to get out of
that work!"</p>

<p>Cosden took Jeremy Major up the hill to introduce him to Anne
Cosden.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch21" name="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI. &mdash; THE
FIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">The best that could be said about that combination
was, briefly, that it did not work. When Mr. Cosden came wearily
home from the mine that night, and eight weary, dirty, hungry men
with him, and when he slumped through the door of the shack, he
found his daughter with a face white and pinched with anger.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with you, Anne?" said her father.</p>

<p>"I thought I had seen men of all kinds," said Anne in a wild
explosion. "I thought I had seen the most worthless types in the
world. But this precious good-for-nothing that you found for me is
the worst yet! A helper? He's not even a shadow of an excuse for a
man! Why, dad, he can't even chop kindling wood straight or without
going to sleep over it. I'm sure he hasn't slept a wink for a
month!" She groaned through set teeth to express the greatness of
her disgust.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to quit on the job, dad," she added hastily. "I
don't mind cooking for hungry men. But I hate having that creature
around. And impertinent, too! When I told him that I'd pay him off
and he could quit, he told me that he would take orders from nobody
but the man who hired him, when it came to stopping his job!"</p>

<p>There was a growl of rage from one of the men, a big, two-handed
fighting man, with a shock of hair as red as Anne Cosden's and a
chin of wood and a nose which was obviously a pliable button of
India rubber.</p>

<p>"Let me go out and handle him," said the big fellow. "You're a
tired man, Cosden. Let me go and take care of him."</p>

<p>Cosden weakly gave way to temptation, because, be it understood,
he did not really believe that Sammy Gregg had told him the truth
about this strangely lazy lad. And though there was that about the
youth that gave him an odd, eerie feeling, still, he was not quite
sure. And he was rather glad to have his warrior from the mine try
out Mr. Jeremy Major.</p>

<p>So tall Dick Harrison paused in the door of the kitchen and
scowled into the interior.</p>

<p>"A bum," said he, speaking his thoughts with unnecessary
loudness. "A plain, good-for-nothing tramp!"</p>

<p>The others crowded as close to the door as they could, and they
saw the slender, shiftless-looking fellow at the sink glance
hastily around over a hunched shoulder as in fear. And then the
work of washing the pans was resumed with a sudden flurry of noise
and a splashing of greasy dish water. Yet the work did not seem to
get forward any faster.</p>

<p>Dick Harrison strode into the kitchen. "Look here, bo," he
roared, "I hear you've been talking back to the lady?"</p>

<p>"Mister," said the shrinking form of Jeremy Major, "I'm doin' no
harm."</p>

<p>"You rat!" said Dick Harrison, nodding with the conviction of
his emotion. "Just plain worthless rat."</p>

<p>"Dick! Dick!" cried Anne Cosden. "You won't be too rough with
him! He's not very big, after all. And he really didn't say much
back to me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll be gentle, I will!" snarled Dick. And he reached out a
brawny hand and fixed it upon the shoulder of the new kitchen
helper.</p>

<p>"You get out where I can have a look at you," he said. And he
dragged Jeremy lightly forth from the kitchen and out into the
light of the dying day. Oh, how fresh and how bright and how gay
was the evening, and from up and down the street of the town there
was a subdued rattling of contented voices of hungry men, back from
their labor on the lode above them, and ready to eat as only
laborers know how.</p>

<p>"Dick Harrison!" cried the girl in a fresh alarm. "You won't
hurt him, really?"</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about him," said Dick over his shoulder. "I
know how to handle this kind, if I don't know anything else. You
leave him be to me!"</p>

<p>"Leave Dick to look after him," said others among those who
stood about. "He won't give him any more than is good for his
troubles, you can bet. That's just an ordinary, greasy, low-down
hobo!"</p>

<p>"Now," said Dick Harrison, "I hear that you wouldn't be fired
today!"</p>

<p>"I was hired by a man," said the shrinking Jeremy, giving the
effect of dangling bodily from the thick, suspended arm of
Harrison. "And I thought I ought to be fired by a man, too."</p>

<p>"Well," said Harrison, "you were hired by a man, and now it is a
man who fires you!" He added: "Get out!" and he swung his heavy
hand through the air.</p>

<p>It just missed the head of Jeremy as that young worthy ducked
toward safety. The hand of Harrison carved the air only, while
Jeremy, having slipped oddly from the grip of the other, stood at
little distance saying humbly: "I'm sure I don't wish any trouble,
you know. But I have to wait to be fired by Mr. Cosden."</p>

<p>"You have to wait?" shouted Dick Harrison, more than a little
flustered because that swinging, open hand of his had not cuffed
the cheek of the tramp. "Then wait and take this!"</p>

<p>He ought not to have done it, considering the superiority of his
size and the thickness of his athletic shoulders, and the length of
his heavy, muscular arms. Certainly he should not have struck with
all his might at an opponent so much smaller.</p>

<p>But Harrison was a hot-tempered man, and now his anger quite got
the best of him. Besides, he was of the school which strikes first
and thinks afterward.</p>

<p>He struck with the precision, too, of a trained boxer. No
lumbering, round-about, clublike blow, but a snapping punch from
the shoulder with half the back muscles rippling into it.</p>

<p>One looked to see that terrible plunging fist dash tight through
the meager body of little Jeremy Major. But, no, by some lucky
chance he seemed to have blundered out of the way of the blow. Or
was it entirely by chance?</p>

<p>"Won't somebody please take him away before there's any
trouble?" cried Jeremy Major.</p>

<p>"Dick Harrison!" cried Anne Cosden, who saw that the matter had
gone too far, and that Dick's wild temper was apt to do the smaller
man an injury. "Dick Harrison, that's enough. Don't you dare to
touch him again."</p>

<p>As well have called to the stormy wind. Dick Harrison, with a
snarl of growing fury, rushed wildly in!</p>

<p>There was something terribly brutal in the charge of that big
body upon the smaller man, when the mere weight of his hand seemed
so amply sufficient to put an end to the fight, if fight it could
be called.</p>

<p>And then the oddest thing happened. For it seemed that Jeremy
Major, as he huddled away from the other, with his hands raised
timidly before his face in a most unmilitary posture, it seemed
that Jeremy Major, as Harrison rushed in, stumbled, and stumbled
forward, and he seemed to reach out his left hand to stop himself,
clutching at the empty air, as a man will do.</p>

<p>Except that this time, by the veriest accident, of course, the
knuckles of that flying left fist clicked just upon the ridge of
Harrison's jaw bone. And his rush stopped!</p>

<p>Indeed, he was brought up standing, as the saying is, and rocked
back upon his heels. And from the spectators, who indeed were
seeing stranger sights than they had ever dreamed of seeing, there
broke a groan of wonder. From Harrison came a roar of bewildered
fury.</p>

<p>Jeremy Major had leaped back an astonishing distance. He seemed
to have grown, suddenly, two or three inches in height. He filled
his clothes more sleekly. And he was poised on his toes with the
lightness, well, with the lightness of nothing human, you may be
sure!</p>

<p>"Will you take that clumsy fool away from me before I do him any
harm?" said Jeremy Major in a peculiar voice. "Will you take him
away before I have to&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was Mr. Cosden, whose brain was a vital second or two faster
than the brains of the men, who heard and understood at once. And
he uttered a yell to Harrison and tried to break out to get at the
fighters.</p>

<p>It was too late. He could only paw and strain to break away
through the jam at the doorway, while, before his eyes, happened
one of the oddest things he had ever witnessed in the length of a
very full and active life. For as Harrison leaped in
again&mdash;warily, now, as a trained fighter who realizes that he
has an enemy worthy of his steel&mdash;Jeremy Major went to meet
him.</p>

<p>You could not say that Jeremy exactly leaped as Harrison did.
But he slithered low over the ground. One was simply conscious that
he had left one place and had appeared again at another.</p>

<p>Somehow, he managed to straighten up just under and inside the
arms of big Harrison, and the result was worth traveling long miles
to see. For truly it was as though a shell had exploded in front of
big Harrison. He made a clumsy effort to strike at his smaller
foeman with both hands, but in the meantime the fists of Jeremy
Major had sunk into the mid-section of Harrison's anatomy. He tried
to stagger in and close with this elusive fellow. But his efforts
were only too successful. Jeremy Major met him in mid-air. They
swirled into a tangle of twisting, writhing bodies, and then
Harrison collapsed.</p>

<p>It was all so quick that no one could see exactly what had
happened. Only the result was visible. And the most important
result was the picture of Harrison lying prostrate upon the ground
with his eyes wide and staring, as the eyes of a dead man, and his
face swollen either with effort or from being nearly throttled.</p>

<p>It wasn't a pleasant thing to see. They went to pick him up, and
it was odd to see them go in to him, like children advancing toward
the edge of a fire, so carefully did they keep their eyes fixed
upon the form of Jeremy Major in the background.</p>

<p>He made no effort to persecute his fallen enemy, however. He
seemed to be shrinking away into the distance, as though ashamed of
what he had done.</p>

<p>They raised Harrison. He himself half-recovered from his swoon
at the same instant and put out a hand to help himself up, but the
arm which he extended crumpled under the strain and he uttered a
wild scream of pain. And everyone nearby could hear the gritting of
the broken ends of the arm bone. At some time in that brief and
terrible struggle, Jeremy Major had snapped the arm of his enemy
like a pipestem.</p>

<p>I suppose everyone there had seen a good deal of
rough-and-tumble fighting. Even the girl had seen her share, for
Anne Cosden loved boxing almost well enough to try her own turn at
the gloves. However, there was no jubilant shout from the
spectators, no shout such as usually goes up when the smaller man
of a pair wins a fight. And the reason was that this was different
from ordinary fighting.</p>

<p>There was not many outward signs of a fist fight on the body of
big Harrison. His face, as has been said, was swollen and
discolored a little and his jaw was marked with a purple patch near
the point. But, on the whole, he looked rather like one who has
collapsed from a great shock than one who has been beaten with
fists to insensibility.</p>

<p>And the same touch of horror that was in his eyes was in the
eyes of the others as they raised him to his feet. He saw Jeremy
Major, then, and uttered a groan. Then he was led, staggering, into
the house.</p>

<p>The men were busy with him. Only Anne Cosden remained behind in
the yard of the house with Jeremy Major, and now she turned and
looked at him with a frown.</p>

<p>"Well," said she at last, "I see that you've been playing a part
all day long. I suppose you have simply been hungry for the trouble
to start so that you could show us what you could do!"</p>

<p>And he replied quietly: "Do you think I really wanted that
fight?"</p>

<p>When she looked back on the affair, she had to admit that he
certainly had not pushed himself forward in the fray. Yet she could
not help a feeling that his lazy, shrinking indolence had been all
an assumed mask. No one, with this devilish, compacted energy
within, could have been utterly nonchalant at a moment when battle
was in the offing. And then, too, there had been a destructiveness
about his fight. It was not like a mere encounter of fists.</p>

<p>Usually in those struggles there is a vast deal of swinging and
smashing and puffing and heaving. But here there had been hardly
more than a brush, one tangle, one thrust and there lay Harrison,
swollen of face, crushed, perhaps broken in spirit forever, and
here was this slender youth untouched!</p>

<p>In the older days, no doubt, this matter would have been put
down to a little use of black magic, and though there were few
girls more levelheaded than Anne Cosden, yet even Anne had a slight
sense of weird awe.</p>

<p>"Well," said Anne, "and what do you want to do now?"</p>

<p>"Stay here, ma'am, and go right on working," said Jeremy.</p>

<p>"Working?" echoed Anne. "We'll keep you, though. Out of
curiosity, if nothing else. But will you please tell me where you
learned to fight like that?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Jeremy. "I used a lot of patience, you know. I
had to admit, when I was younger, that I was a good deal weaker
than most boys of my age. And so I had to make a good deal of
myself if I were going to hold up my end with the other boys. I had
to do everything in the best way, or else I couldn't do it at
all."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Miss Cosden. "All very probable, I'm sure! And the
same sort of patience, I presume, taught you how to work so fast,
with so little effort! Young man, are you trying to make a fool out
of me?"</p>

<p>"No," said Jeremy Major blandly. "Oh, no!"</p>

<p>And he and the young lady stared at each other, she with a
bright-eyed challenge in her eyes, and he calmly defying her and
smiling inwardly, so it seemed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mr. Cosden had busied himself with Dick
Harrison and that stout young man gradually came back toward
consciousness with a brain still reeling. He wanted to know where
he was, and if the fight was over. And when he was assured that it
was, he shamelessly thanked the Lord for it. After they had poured
a dram or two of hot brandy down his throat, he recovered a bit
more and gave them his own impressions of the battle.</p>

<p>"It was like hitting a bunch of feathers and finding that they
were carved out of rock!" said he. "I thought my fist could hardly
be kept from going clean through him. But when he got his hands on
me I thought I'd fallen under the feet of a thousand buffaloes
stampeding!"</p>

<p>So young Harrison talked on, without shame, not as one who
details a defeat, but as one interested in the portrayal of some
unhuman phenomenon.</p>

<p>Mr. Hubert Cosden felt that there was a heavy moral
responsibility on his hands for what young Major had done. And he
gave his men a little talk in which he told them that it was
possible that Jeremy Major would be on hand for some time, and in
that case, he hoped that they would make it a point not to indulge
in any more quarrels with Jeremy. Mr. Cosden discovered that he
need not have troubled himself about this matter. His young men
were not at all inclined to experiment after Harrison had opened
their eyes.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch22" name="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII. &mdash; MAJOR'S
PLAN</h2>

<p class="first">Early the next morning in the canvas-walled,
floorless place which was known as "The Hotel," young Sammy Gregg
was wakened by the capable hand of Hubert Cosden upon his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Gregg," said the miner, "tell me at once just what you know
about this fellow Major, this Jeremy Major."</p>

<p>It took Sammy Gregg hardly ten minutes to tell how he had first
seen an unsuccessful young beggar blowing improvised music with a
flute in Munson, and how he had dropped ten dollars into the hat of
the stranger; of how he had seen the same figure grown brilliant
and playing with huge sums in a gambling den in Texas not very many
days later; of how he had encountered him later in a tramp
"Jungle," and how Jeremy Major and his horse had driven a herd of
wild mustangs through the mountains to Crumbock.</p>

<p>Mr. Cosden listened to these details with a hungry interest, but
still he continued to shake his head, as though he did not find in
what he heard the sort of answers which were satisfying to him.</p>

<p>"It's a dangerous business, using fire to fight fire, or poison
to fight poison. My one hope is that the business will be over
soon, and if they don't mutually brain one another, I shall be
disappointed. Jeremy Major is coming to see you. He has told me
that he is willing to do whatever he can to handle Furness for me.
And he thinks that he needs you and me both to arrange the
matter.</p>

<p>"His idea is an odd one. And yet there is something a little
attractive about it, too. What he wants to do is to throw out a
sort of general challenge to big Furness. He says that Furness is
not holding up stages merely to get the money out of them, but also
because he is rather amused by the exciting work. Confound his
heart!</p>

<p>"Now, then, what this fellow Major wants to do is to have me
entrust a good fat shipment of gold to the stage. You yourself,
Gregg, will go along to deliver the shipment and to check up on all
that happens. There will be a driver, and there will be young
Major. Or, if a driver doesn't want to handle the risky job, Major
himself says he will drive the coach and 'fight' it, also.</p>

<p>"You understand the scheme? Everything is to be published far
and wide. Jeremy Major is going to attempt to push a stage carrying
a good many thousands in gold straight through the mountains to
Munson. And the hope is that Mr. Furness will take it into his head
to meet Mr. Major and dispute the way with himpartly for the sake
of the money and partly for the sake of maintaining himself as
ruler of the roost!"</p>

<p>This was the origin of that odd plan which Jeremy Major had
conceived, and which he also desired to execute. And Sammy Gregg,
listening to the scheme, found a good deal that he could object to.
But he also saw two great advantages for himself for which he would
willingly have sacrificed himself a thousand times over. One
advantage was that he would, in this fashion, be rid of Furness.
Another was that if Jeremy Major traveled in that stage line to
defend it, it would discourage not only Furness, but perhaps all
other prospective thieves who had sundry villainous intents in
mind.</p>

<p>He announced on the spot his willingness to direct the whole
affair and travel in the "danger stage" himself for that purpose.
Also, he would provide, if he could, a driver and a good team to
make the first relay run.</p>

<p>There would be no trouble about the provision of horses. For the
Texas mustangs, which had lost so much flesh during the first few
days of the operation of the line, were now waxing fat again. And
their spirits were rising with their flesh. For poor Sammy Gregg
had been forced to reduce the number of stages until now only one
was making the trip. It came from Munson to Crumbock. And at
Crumbock it was relieved by another vehicle which started back
under the same driver.</p>

<p>But, in the meantime, the patronage of the line had fallen off
so hugely that even the running of one coach was not worthwhile. It
was never a third filled. And they were penniless adventurers. For
the coach from Munson to Crumbock and back had become known
throughout the range as the "danger line," or the "danger stage," a
name to which it had lived up to only too well.</p>

<p>But now, with the mines booming more strongly than ever with the
presence of business coming closer and closer to the boiling point,
the one rapid and effective means of communication between Munson
and Crumbock was practically abandoned by miners and travelers.</p>

<p>Sammy Gregg had to admit that they were right. All he objected
to was that they made a joke of his line. Yes, even the men who
were on his payroll were inclined to smile at the prospects of the
stage. All of them were looking forward to a necessary change of
work before long, and all of them were loafing on a job which no
longer required their industry. And Sammy, remarking the fact that
the rats were leaving the sinking ship, felt every day more
convinced that his doom was surely creeping upon him.</p>

<p>Furness, of course, was the main rock upon which he was
splitting. All the other ruffians who had infested the highway
across the mountains had not been as dangerous to life and property
as that single man. And now there was a last hope, that Jeremy
Major might meet and crush the famous rider of the gray horse.</p>

<p>Sammy himself saw the stage looked to, and every nut in her
tightened and the wheels greased.</p>

<p>He saw the six best horses he had prepared for the work. Then he
set about finding a driver for the team.</p>

<p>This, however, was a different matter. The news had purposely
been sent far abroad that the stage, on the fourteenth of the
month, was to start out for Munson with fifteen thousand dollars in
raw gold aboard her. And it was perfectly well understood why that
information had been cast out. It was that a hook might be baited
for Mr. Chester Ormonde Furness. And there was a very generally
expressed opinion that Mr. Furness would not only be snagged by the
hook, but that he would straightway swim off with hook, line,
sinker, and fishers also!</p>

<p>Nobody, in short, wished to take the job. Old Alec, with his
crippled arm, wrote in to sympathize with his old boss upon the
cowardice of his successors on the driver's scat. But Alec himself
had been rendered not available by the very enemy whom now they had
specially singled out.</p>

<p>If there were any doubt as to what might become of the news
which had been sent out in the general direction of the mountains
which sheltered Mr. Furness, it was removed when a neatly written
and quite surprising letter was received by Sammy in the following
language:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Gregg:</span>
</p>

<p class="letter">It is so long since I have seen anything but
frightened tramps in your stages that I am delighted to hear that
you have changed your policy, and that you have now made yourself
responsible for a shipment of gold.</p>

<p class="letter">I am so interested that I must convey to you my
intention of taking special charge of the gold at the earliest
opportunity.</p>

<p class="letter">Believe me to be most faithfully yours, and in
gratitude for many favors conferred by you in the past,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Chester Ormonde
Furness.</span>
</p>
<br>

<p>Over this letter young Sammy Gregg pondered with a gray face. He
was fairly well convinced that, no matter how formidable slender
Mr. Major might be, Furness was unbeatable. And therefore he
carried the letter to Cosden with a gloomy silence. However, Cosden
was indomitable.</p>

<p>"I have seen this man handle his hands. If he can use a gun half
as well, he will be fairly invincible! Don't talk to me about
failure. He cannot fail! The gold goes by that stage, and if you
cannot persuade another man or young Major himself to drive, I'll
drive the infernal wagon myself!"</p>

<p>There was no need of that. Jeremy Major willingly took upon
himself to manage the team, and upon the appointed morning, with
the June sun just turning the sky to rose and gold, Jeremy Major
stepped into the street and passed through the dense crowd which
had gathered to see the "danger coach" start. Six men held the
dancing, furious horses, all high strung from their long stay in
the pasture. But when Jeremy mounted the seat where Sammy Gregg was
already waiting for him and picked up the reins, it was noted that
under his hand and voice the team became suddenly quiet. A moment
more and the brake was eased with a screech and the big wagon
lurched away down the street.</p>

<p>There was a final thrill for the crowd of spectators after the
coach had rolled down the street and while they were still standing
shoulder to shoulder, watching the pair on the high-pitched seat
rock with every inequality of the road.</p>

<p>Someone called out: "Look here! Look at this stray! Hey, boys,
who owns that hoss?"</p>

<p>There was such a note of wild excitement in this call that every
head jerked around and presently they were aware of a tall, black
stallion footing it down the street in strange guise.</p>

<p>For he was fully saddled, most beautifully saddled, in fact. And
upon the horn of the saddle there was tied a bridle which was one
mass of burnished metal work. But the head itself of the horse was
free, and as he trotted along he tossed his crest high and glanced
disdainfully from side to side upon the people in the street. For
he was of a royal dignity, this king of kings among horses.</p>

<p>There was not a white hair on him. He was as black as tar from
head to foot. Yes, and the hooves themselves were as black as
though they had been newly stained. And he shone, too, as though he
had been newly burnished, so that one could speak of the brightness
of his glimmering flanks, but hardly of their color. Yes, the very
hooves flashed as though they had just been waxed and polished. Yet
one knew, after an instant of attention, that nature was the groom
in this case.</p>

<p>There is a gait which exceeds in beauty either the racing step
or the swinging canter or the high or "daisy-cutting" trot; and
that is the walking pace of a truly fine horse. For, as he walks,
his actions are not too swift for the human eye to follow the play
of light upon his shoulders and the exquisite cushioning
flexibility of the supple fetlock joints. And what these knowers of
horseflesh saw as the big black walked past stirred their hearts.
One did not need to know horses. A child would have understood that
here was the speed of the wind.</p>

<p>Presently he broke into a gallop, swept out from the town, and
away after the stage and up the hill, following his master.</p>

<p>The black did not alter his stride until he had put himself
ahead of the swinging trot of the stagecoach that Jeremy Major was
driving over the mountain way. And, still in the lead, he idled
along, keeping himself just beyond the leaders, pausing now and
again to crop a tempting bunch of grass, and then brushing on.</p>

<p>"If Furness should get away," said Jeremy Major, and finished by
pointing to the stallion.</p>

<p>Out from Crumbock there was a three-mile slope to climb, and
after that for a distance the trail wound along the crest of a
ridge. They had covered a good mile of this easier going when Major
called softly and suddenly to the horses and at the same time shot
the long handle of the brake forward. There was a screech of the
brake pads against the heavy iron tires. The coach slowed to a
walking pace, with the traces of the team slack, and then for the
first time Sammy Gregg saw a reason for the halt.</p>

<p>Through the trees at the next bend appeared the body of a great
dappled gray horse with a tall rider in the saddle&mdash;Furness,
with his rifle at the ready&mdash;Furness with the rifle butt
against his shoulder.</p>

<p>It cracked; a sound as of a whirring hornet darted into the ears
of Sammy Gregg; and Jeremy Major was out of the seat and lunging
down with a bullet through body or head!</p>

<p>No, for he had landed astride of the near wheeler and then
flicked off again onto the ground, and while he was still in the
air a bit of steel gleamed in his hand. It spoke as the feet of the
owner touched the deep dust. And Sammy Gregg saw the rifle slip
from the grip of Furness, saw it hang from the fingers of one hand,
and then the Winchester dropped while Furness clutched at one arm
with his other hand.</p>

<p>At the same time, he swung the gray about with a sway of his
body and a twist of his knees, and the forest closed instantly
behind him. Through the silence which fell with a sudden weight as
the jangling noise of the coach stopped, Sammy Gregg could hear the
horse of the fugitive crashing through the underbrush.</p>

<p>Was this the end of the battle toward which he and the other
people of the mountains had looked forward with so much eagerness
and dread? No, for here was Jeremy Major catching the black
stallion, Clancy, and leaping with a catlike lightness into the
saddle. Another instant and the black was sweeping down the road,
his head a little turned and his mouth opened to receive the bit of
the bridle which his master leaned forward along his neck to fit
between his teeth. In an instant the bridle was in place, and Major
had twitched the stallion from the road into the brush.</p>

<p>There was one more glimpse for Sammy Gregg. He could look from
his high seat far down the hillside to a clearing among the trees
and an instant later he saw the gray horse dart across the opening,
dodge through a thick hedge of bushes, and pass on out of
sight.</p>

<p>An instant later the black flashed into view, with Jeremy Major
pitched forward like a jockey on the neck of the stallion. There
was no dodging for Clancy. He rose like a steeplechaser at the
hedge and cleared it with an arrowy leap. Then he, too, was lost in
the forest beyond.</p>

<p>There was no doubt in his mind about which horse would win the
race. The gray was a grand runner and a good mountain horse, used
to this work. But he might as well have been matched against a hawk
as against the black! But as for the battle which would ensue when
the two met, that was a different matter. For it was the left arm
of big Chester Furness which had been wounded and his right, his
revolver hand, would be as accurate as ever. It seemed to Sammy
Gregg that the power of Furness and the terrible speed of Jeremy
Major would make a resistless force and an immovable object meeting
somewhere yonder in the wilds.</p>

<p>In the meantime he had many thousands of dollars worth of gold
in the stage. There was no guard to help him. A gun was useless in
his hands. And the management of the coach team was a very
sufficient mystery to him. At the first open space he turned the
stage and its six horses laboriously around and started back for
Crumbock.</p>

<p>What difference did it make whether or not the stage was pushed
through to its destination? He and everyone else understood
perfectly that what was of importance was not the traveling of the
stage, but the defeat of Chester Furness, if that could be
arranged.</p>

<p>But when his team was seen cresting the slope above Crumbock,
that busy town suspended all work and flocked in a noisy mass to
learn the news.</p>

<p>Was the gold gone?</p>

<p>Had they seen Furness?</p>

<p>Where was Jeremy Major? Dead on the road and his horse stolen by
the outlaw?</p>

<p>All they got for an answer was that the great pair had clashed,
and that the first round of the battle had been a victory for
Jeremy Major, and that the last seen of the outlaw, he was riding
away for life, with the black stallion in swift pursuit.</p>

<p>That was the story he told over again to Mr. Cosden, when the
miner came to ask hasty questions and receive back the gold which
had been for the baiting of the trap.</p>

<p>"And Miss Cosden?" asked Sammy timidly.</p>

<p>"She has set her teeth and will not show a thing," said Cosden.
"But come up to the house tonight. I want to talk to you and get
all the details over again. Now I'm busy. But I want to hear
everything, and you can wager that Anne wants to hear it, too!"</p>

<p>So that eventful morning ended, and the roar of the mining town
began again, and the mere thought of what had happened seemed to be
lost.</p>

<p>Not lost to Sammy Gregg, however, as he sat in his "office,"
which had once been so thronged with business, and which was now so
empty of all interest.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch23" name="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII. &mdash; ANNE GOES
EAST</h2>

<p class="first">At least he had the night to wait for, the talk
with Cosden, and perhaps a glimpse of Anne. But, oh, how slowly the
day waned, and how many hundreds of times he looked wistfully and
vainly toward the dark forests of the southern hills, hoping
against hope, still, that the rider of the black horse might
emerge, unscathed, and triumphant. Or perhaps was Cosden right?
Would it be better for everyone if both of those warriors fought
until the two lay dead in the woods, with only the owls to watch
them fight and die?</p>

<p>The evening came at last. Sammy saw the men from the mine come
for supper to the Cosden house. He waited nervously until they
left, and then he climbed the slope and presented himself at the
door. Cosden took him in. The rattle of pans in the kitchen died
away, and big Anne Cosden came swinging in and sat down on the arm
of a chair improvised from a packing case and some supple, bent
boughs.</p>

<p>"I'm mostly interested in just one thing," said Anne Cosden.
"When they fought, is the story true that Chester Furness turned
and rode away?"</p>

<p>"With a bullet through his left arm," said Sammy honestly. "I
saw the red stain."</p>

<p>"Then," said Anne Cosden with a firm conviction, "they are both
dead!"</p>

<p>There was a sharp exclamation from her father. "What makes you
think that, Anne?"</p>

<p>"If Furness couldn't beat him in the first fight, he could never
beat him after once turning his back. And he could never escape.
Nothing that lives could escape from that black horse, with a cat
like Jeremy Major in the saddle. And I'm going back to work. I
don't want to hear any more about it!"</p>

<p>She was as good as her word. She returned to the kitchen and
left her father staring gloomily back at the door.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said he to Sammy Gregg. "I can't tell. Sometimes
I think that she doesn't care a whack about either of them. But I'm
not sure. She beats me!"</p>

<p>The last was whispered, and his eyes fixed upon the outer door
of the cabin and grew wide with staring. Sammy Gregg turned with a
start, and he saw over his shoulder the slender form of Jeremy
Major standing in the doorway. Beyond, there was the stamp of an
impatient horse, Clancy, standing dimly in the night!</p>

<p>Then Jeremy came in and slumped into a chair.</p>

<p>"It was mighty hot this afternoon, wasn't it?" said Jeremy. "I
lay up on the edge of the woods for a long time waiting for it to
cool off. There was a pair of gray squirrels that couldn't agree
which owned the tree I was lying under.</p>

<p>"They kept paying visits to each other. And finally they
clinched. They made the fur fly, I can tell you. Finally they
tumbled off their branch. I thought they'd drop eighty feet to the
ground and break themselves to a pulp. But they didn't! Did you
ever see a squirrel dive for the ground?</p>

<p>"The fellows hadn't fallen twenty feet when they shook
themselves apart, and spread out their tails and flattened their
bodies, and fluffed out their tails behind them. Those big tails
were like balloons, holding them back when they fell. Oh, they
dropped with a chunk, of course, but they weren't hurt. They
scampered up the trunk of the same&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" broke in Mr. Cosden.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Jeremy blandly.</p>

<p>"Do you think we give a continental damn about the pair of gray
squirrels in their infernal pine tree?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Jeremy a little sadly, "I suppose you don't!"</p>

<p>"Then tell us what we want to know, in the name of Heaven. What
happened between you and big Furness?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Jeremy, "we met each other, after a while, and we
had quite a talk. We came to a sort of an agreement."</p>

<p>"Go on, Major!"</p>

<p>"And he gave me a note to take back to you here. Let me see. I
hope I haven't got it all rumpled up. Here you are."</p>

<p>It was a single sheet of paper, folded twice and pinned with a
sliver of wood. And it was addressed to Anne Cosden. Her father
took it with a scowl and carried it silently out to the kitchen.
And by the sudden whitening of her face, he knew that she
recognized the handwriting.</p>

<p>She opened it eagerly, swept through it with a glance, and then
ripped it across and threw it on the floor.</p>

<p>"What in the world," asked Cosden, "has Furness got to say to
you?"</p>

<p>"The man is a coward!" she cried in bitterest scorn. "What do I
care what he has to say? Read it, if you wish!"</p>

<p>He picked up the pieces of torn paper humbly enough and read it
over slowly to himself.</p>

<p>"Does he call you by your first name, girl?"</p>

<p>The letter read:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Anne:</span>
</p>

<p class="letter">I have just finished a long talk with Jeremy
Major. I have to admit to you that he is a most convincing talker.
And, after listening to him, I have decided that I must give up
this foolish amusement of keeping the stage from running.</p>

<p class="letter">Also, I think it is rather dangerous for me to
linger near Crumbock. So I suppose this little letter must serve to
say good-by to you.</p>

<p class="letter">A thousand regrets that we have not had an
opportunity to come to know each other better.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Chester Ormonde
Furness.</span>
</p>
<br>

<p>"And there we are!" murmured Mr. Cosden. "The end of that
chapter. What the devil will the next chapter turn up? But I think
you understand, Mr. Major, that I am eternally grateful to you,
because it was Gregg's stage, but it was my money!"</p>

<p>But that was not the end of the stage.</p>

<p>The next morning there was a change at the Crumbock office of
the Crumbock-Munson stage line. Men were waiting. And the gold
shipment of Mr. Cosden, doubled in size, was joined by two other
shipments, hardly smaller. It was a jammed, packed stage that
finally crawled up the slope, and dipped into the woods beyond.</p>

<p>Three days later word came whirling back to Crumbock that the
trip had been made in perfect safety and in excellent time.
Business thrived, and rates climbed. And Sammy Gregg saw the swift
hundreds pouring into his hands every day and mounting to thousands
each week.</p>

<p>"If you'll stay on as regular guard," he cried to Jeremy Major,
"I'll pay you a hundred a week with nothing to do except to trail
the crooks, if they ever try to hold up the stages again."</p>

<p>"It's sort of a hard life," sighed Jeremy, "cooking chuck for
oneself."</p>

<p>"I'll hire you a cook," said Sammy, "above your wages! And a
servant, if you want, to take care of your horse and your guns for
you."</p>

<p>Jeremy Major sighed and stared up at the pale blue sky, where
the sun was burning.</p>

<p>"Matter of fact," said Jeremy, "I've made up my mind that I'd
better be traveling south. You see, I have a touch of rheumatism up
in these northern countries."</p>

<p>So Sammy attempted no longer to persuade. Jeremy was gone. After
his departure, Anne Cosden suddenly took the stage for Munson,
bound East. And suddenly all that was left for Sammy was to sit
quietly wherever he pleased and watch the gold flood flow steadily
into his coffers. He had won, but the glory was small in his eyes.
For Sammy had been growing since he first left Brooklyn, and now he
had reached a certain pitch of mind where money alone could not
satisfy him.</p>

<p>The one thing he wanted was Anne Cosden; and were she East or
West he felt that she was beyond his dreams. There was only one
bitter satisfaction, that through his engineering he had put her
beyond the dreams of handsome Chester Furness as well.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch24" name="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV. &mdash; TORTURE BY
FIRE</h2>

<p class="first">To understand the extent to which the mountains
were shocked, one must consider what "Hobo" Durfee was, before the
tragedy happened to him.</p>

<p>His nickname of Hobo had been honestly earned. He had been
nothing but a tramp, a lazy, good-for-nothing scamp who wandered
about the country inventing new methods for avoiding labor in any
form.</p>

<p>This continued more than halfway through his life, but when he
was forty years old, Hobo Durfee suddenly contracted what might be
called the industry fever. Some said it was due to the fact that he
had loaned a friend a dollar and that the man paid him back two
dollars the next month. At any rate, Hobo Durfee never forgot. He
laid the thought of that dollar of "interest" away in his memory,
embalmed in myrrh and spikenard. And that even started his interest
in accumulating money.</p>

<p>He began to put away every bit of it that he could lay his hands
on. But he did not really have the courage to be a stirring thief.
So presently he learned that his love of money was greater than
hatred of work, and he began to work, steadily, earnestly.</p>

<p>He accumulated more and more money. In five years he had a shade
over a thousand dollars in a bank, and then the bank failed! Durfee
got his money out, because he was one of the first to call with a
check when an evil rumor got abroad. But he never forgot how close
he came to losing his money on that day, and thereafter, nothing in
the world could persuade him to trust his money in hands other than
his own. It was known that all his wages were turned into gold, and
that all of that gold was hidden away in some secluded place on his
own land.</p>

<p>For he had a little shack of his own and a patch of ground down
in the river bottom. It was just as much as he was able to
cultivate by himself. On it he raised, during a part of the year,
vegetables for the market in Munson, which was fairly near his
place. No one else, in that region of timber and mines, had even so
much as thought of raising vegetables, and therefore his labor
brought him quite a rich reward.</p>

<p>Besides, he was working on his land only a part of the year, and
the rest of the time, even now that he was fifty-five years old, he
proved himself a good cowhand in every sense of the term by his
work on the cattle ranches. So that it was estimated that Hobo
Durfee, in the last years of his life, must have laid up between
five and ten thousand dollars in gold, all hidden some place on his
little estate.</p>

<p>Of course that brought the crooks in a swarm, and for years they
almost literally plowed the ground of the Durfee ranch to get at
his treasure every time he left his house. They never found it. Old
Durfee was too foxy to leave his precious money without having it
so securely tucked away that not even an eagle's eye could have
located it. And so, after a time, the crooks left off trying and
Durfee was in peace. A pretty well-deserved peace, too, as everyone
agreed.</p>

<p>The old man liked to talk to people about the money he had saved
and about the good old foolish, happy, sunny days in trampdom. He
liked to talk so well that he kept open house and would entertain
anyone who came by with food and chatter.</p>

<p>Well, in the West they appreciate hospitality. In a country
where men know desert travel and the heart-stopping joy of coming
in sight of a human habitation with smoke curling out of it, they
put a high rating upon sincerely hospitable folks. And such a value
was placed upon Hobo Durfee.</p>

<p>He grew a lot of strawberries in the spring of the year, and as
they came ripe, he used to gather them and stew them into a
delicious jam. That Durfee jam became famous for more than a
hundred miles around. Literally hundreds and hundreds had taken a
trip scores of miles out of their way in order to come at Hobo
Durfee, sit by his stove, eat his pone and delicious strawberry
jam, drink his coffee, and then go their way.</p>

<p>He was very happy when he was talking about the good old days
when he never used to turn a hand at work. He had never stopped
hating work. He had simply come to love money more! And when he
began to turn to the subject of how he learned to labor and to
save, the boys used to sit around and laugh at him a good deal. But
he was willing to be laughed at. It was part of the game, and he
liked company so well, and liked an audience so well, that he was
very willing to have them laugh at him.</p>

<p>It would have done you good to see the red-brown face of that
old chap with a grizzled fringe of whiskers more or less long, for
he was not like most misers. The point was, some said, that the
knowledge that he had a quantity of gold hidden away kept him
bubbling over with so much happiness that he just wanted others to
hear about it. So the door of his shack was never closed.</p>

<p>You must know all this to understand how old Hobo Durfee jumped
up, one night, and laughed and nodded to some horsemen who had
stopped outside of his shack and then had crowded into the doorway.
There had been no other callers there on this day, and Hobo Durfee
was warmed clear down to his boots when he saw so many forms of men
outside his door.</p>

<p>He called out: "Come on in, boys! I've just finished making up
some of the most sizzling good jam that you ever seen. And I'm just
after finishing mixing up some pone and shoving the pans in the
oven. And outside of that, I've got about five minutes to start the
coffee. Which there ain't never been no better coffee than I make,
and there ain't gunna never be none better never made."</p>

<p>Then a voice outside the door said, "Tell the old fool that we
ain't come to eat his chuck tonight. And tell him it's something
else we want."</p>

<p>Then the leading two men crowded in through the doorway and old
Hobo Durfee saw that there was a mask on the face of each. A real
hundred percent mask made of black coat lining turned into a sack
and pulled down over the head with just a couple of big holes left
for the eyes to look through and for air to come in. I suppose it
was right then that Hobo guessed what was coming.</p>

<p>He saw that he didn't have a chance. His gun was clear across on
the far side of the room. And I suppose there was no particular
desire in Hobo to get the gun, at that. All he wanted to do was to
make people happy. And besides, what could they get in his house
except jam and pone and coffee, which he offered them just as
freely without any sign of a mask or a gun?</p>

<p>"Well, boys," said he, "you're mighty welcome to anything that
you can see around here. Just look around and help yourselves. But
I guess that you ain't gonna see nothing much worth carrying away,
unless it's some of my cans of jam or maybe the new saddle
blanket."</p>

<p>"Leave off the guff, will you, Hobo, you old fool?" said one of
the men. "We ain't gunna do any of the looking tonight. You can do
the looking for us!"</p>

<p>You can wager that poor old Hobo Durfee was hard hit by that.
But he blinked at them for a time and tried to smile around the
well-chewed stem of his corncob pipe.</p>

<p>"All right, boys," said he. "I guess I know how to take a
joke!"</p>

<p>"Joke?" said another fellow, squeezing his way into the house,
"you chuck out the coin, old bo, or you're gunna find that this
here is the hottest joke that you ever laid hold of in your life.
And don't you forget it!"</p>

<p>It took the smile from the lips of Hobo Durfee and he stood
rather weakly, looking from one black mask to another.</p>

<p>"Show him what we mean," said some one tersely.</p>

<p>It was done in an instant. They seized upon Durfee, who made no
resistance to such numbers, and they stripped off his boots. They
then opened the fire box of the stove and carried him up to it
until the heat burned his socks and he uttered a yell of pain and
terror.</p>

<p>They took him away from the fire at once.</p>

<p>"All right, Durfee," they told him. "You show us where the money
is or you see what you get!"</p>

<p>When poor old Durfee saw that they actually meant what they
said, he was silent and stared at them. He simply could not
believe. No matter what the first part of his life had been, the
past fifteen years had been so flooded by kindliness that I suppose
it was impossible for the ex-hobo to understand that this brutality
was really intended or that there were creatures in the world
capable of it.</p>

<p>At any rate, he maintained that silence until they caught hold
of him and actually thrust him up to the fire box so close that his
socks caught fire.</p>

<p>He screamed in earnest this time and they brought him away and
demanded with a snarl if he were ready to give them what they
wanted. But he was not ready! And they pushed him up to the blazing
wood until his feet&mdash;</p>

<p>But Munson saw those feet afterward, and it is better to leave
that part until later.</p>

<p>According to the approved story, Durfee fainted after one of the
applications of the torture. But they threw a half-bucket of cold
water in his face and waited for him to come to. Then they began
again, and he stood the fiendish cruelty until the fire had
actually&mdash;</p>

<p>But this is unspeakable!</p>

<p>All that one can say is that when he finally surrendered he was
too far gone to walk. He was too far gone to creep. He had to be
stimulated with whisky, and after he had half a pint of that under
his belt he was able to whisper to them and they carried him with
them out of the house and they brought him to the old shed where he
kept his horse.</p>

<p>It had once been a house. The shed was built up around the last
standing parts of the chimney and a portion of the north wall.
Inside that chimney, which no one knew about, by reaching down half
an arm's length and removing a few loose bricks, they found an
aperture, and inside that aperture they found the treasure of
Durfee.</p>

<p>There were nothing but twenty-dollar gold pieces. And there were
three hundred and eight-seven of these. Which made exactly seven
thousand, seven hundred and forty dollars that they looted from
him.</p>

<p>There were six of them altogether.</p>

<p>No, just at the end a big man came galloping up and when he
found what they had been doing, he cursed them and said that he was
through with them forever. But they pointed out that the business
was done and that he might as well share in the profits and forget
about it.</p>

<p>Which he did.</p>

<p>So that the total was only just a shade above eleven hundred
dollars per thief, and for that small sum they sold their souls,
certainly, into the deepest part of purgatory.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch25" name="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV. &mdash; ANNE TAKES
CHARGE</h2>

<p class="first">Anne left old Durfee lying in the horse shed, and
that was what saved his life and brought danger to the gang.
Because he managed to drag himself onto the bare back of his horse
and he rode on into Munson. Or, rather, the horse took him there,
for when Jack Lorrain found him in the night, Durfee had slid
unconscious from the back of the old gelding and lay in the street,
and the horse stood above his master with his head dropped wearily,
looking uncannily as though he were grieving for the thing that had
been done.</p>

<p>Jack Lorrain, as he said afterward, thought that it was some
drunk who had taken too much liquor and he was about to go on past,
when something about the patience of the old horse standing there
over its master and waiting for him to rise touched the heart of
Jack. And he decided that a man who was worth the trouble of a
horse, in this fashion, must be worth the trouble of another man
also.</p>

<p>So he went to the quiet form that lay in the dust and seized him
by the shoulder, and the body was just as limp as drunkenness to
his touch.</p>

<p>Jack Lorrain was again on the verge of pacing on, but he decided
to take a look at the "drunk" so that the boys could laugh about
the thing the next day. He scratched a match, accordingly, but what
the light of that match showed him kept him speechless until the
flame pricked the tips of his fingers sharply. And then a roar
broke from the lips of Jack, a roar that rang and reechoed through
Munson and brought men tumbling out of houses all around. And when
Lorrain had gathered quite a crowd, he lighted another match and
showed them what he had found.</p>

<p>They picked up Hobo Durfee with a womanish tenderness and they
carried him into what had once been Mortimer's saloon, famous for
iniquity until big Chester Furness, the first day he came to town,
shot Mortimer and treated the boys over the bar, leaving gold on
the bar to pay for the drinks! Gold for a dead man!</p>

<p>The saloon was somewhat less celebrated now, but truly it was
hardly less wicked, and what transpired inside of its walls would
have filled many a chapter in a wild history every day. It was
filled with carousal even at that moment, but the procession
silenced them suddenly and completely.</p>

<p>They gathered with drawn faces and looked at the frightful thing
before them. And all at once everyone became as busy as they were
silent. Some dozen mounted horses and rushed away in varying
directions to find Doctor Stanley Morgan. And some heated water and
brought it. And one youngster newly in from the East offered a
flask of fine old brandy, such as had not been seen in rough Munson
town for many a day.</p>

<p>Others cut the clothes from the body of Hobo Durfee. Others
washed him. Others prepared his bed in the back room of the saloon,
piling it thick and soft with blankets, and clearing all the
rubbish from the chamber and all the dirt from the floor.</p>

<p>Here the doctor arrived, just as Durfee began to groan his way
back to consciousness, and by the doctor's care the feet were
thoroughly dressed before consciousness fully returned to Hobo. And
all agreed that it was a mercy that his sleep had lasted until that
dressing was completed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the boys of Munson wanted to know what would
become of Durfee, and they were assured that he would never walk
again without the aid of a pair of crutches.</p>

<p>To the men of Munson it was a sentence almost worse than death,
and they quietly interchanged glances. Morgan was not much of a
doctor. He would hardly have dared to set up for anything more than
a veterinary in any other part of the world. But his opinion about
such a matter as those feet was not to be doubted.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Durfee had regained consciousness completely.
But the doctor had put enough opiates on his feet to keep him from
torment. He was merely weakly drowsy, and kept turning his head
slowly from side to side and staring at the faces around him in
terror and in horror which would gradually melt away as Jack
Lorrain or some other, sitting by his bed, patted his hand and
would say: "Buck up, old-timer. You're all right now. We're gunna
take care of you. Steady along, old buck. There ain't nothin' to be
skeered of, Hobo. Nobody but your friends here!"</p>

<p>So Durfee would manage a faint, incredulous smile and then shake
his head and frown while he closed his eyes and seemed to be trying
to think back to the confusion of troubles which had closed around
him.</p>

<p>After a time they tried to press him for a little information.
But he could only say: "Seems like I had a sort of fallin' out with
some of the boys, I dunno about what. I disremember exactly what
the argument was all about. They was het up considerable,
though."</p>

<p>That was all he could say, and the doctor decided that it would
be wise not to press him too much that evening.</p>

<p>Half a dozen volunteers decided to sit up, turn and turn about,
with Durfee through the night and another half dozen mounted horses
and dashed furiously out to the little Durfee shack in the bottom
land.</p>

<p>They descended into the damp, cool air of the riverside. They
came to the cabin and found all neat and orderly there, with the
lamp burning steadily on the table.</p>

<p>Only there was a faint cloud of bluish smoke hanging in the
corners of the room, and when they opened the doors of the oven,
they found four big pans of pone burned to a crisp.</p>

<p>Then, with lanterns, they went over the ground outside and very
quickly they decided that someone had been there before them. A
party totally indifferent to the condition of Hobo's garden. For
his choicest patches of ground had been trodden and torn by random
tramplings of hooves. Being experts at this business, they very
readily decided that seven horses had been there.</p>

<p>"What were seven riders doing here," they asked one another,
"interrupting old Durfee while he was bakin' his pone?"</p>

<p>Jack Lorrain, who was one of the party, said solemnly: "Boys, I
hate to think it&mdash;I ain't gonna really think it till I'm
cornered, but I got a hateful sort of lingerin' suspicion that them
burned feet of poor old Hobo's ain't no accident. It was done to
him on purpose by them gents that rode in here over his
garden!"</p>

<p>No one answered Jack. Because it was a little too horrible for
them to speak about. For though there has always been plenty of
brutality in the West, following the frontier, yet it has been
brutality of the "man-to-man" type. The Indians were never able to
establish any precedents with all of their efforts!</p>

<p>However, the searchers did not discover the plundered cavity in
the chimney in the horseshed. They returned to spread a vague rumor
of horror through the town of Munson.</p>

<p>In the morning, people had come from a distance to learn the
facts as soon as old Durfee was able to relate them, and among
others, there were some celebrities recently come down from
Crumbock. They came with the others to the saloon and with whispers
in the front room they were told about the condition of the
sufferer in the back room.</p>

<p>They were Hubert Cosden, millionaire even before he struck it
rich on the Crumbock Lode, and little Sammy Gregg, who had pushed
through the celebrated stage line from Munson to Crumbock, nearly a
year before. People said that Sammy was himself worth more than a
quarter of a million, now, what with the stage line and little
investments here and there among the mines, made at the advice of
his friend, Cosden.</p>

<p>With them came big Anne Cosden riding a strapping black horse on
which she had kept pace from Crumbock with the stage, doing the
hundred miles in a day and a half, a hundred miles of terrible ups
and downs in thirty-six hours! One might have thought that she was
tired out after such a performance, but she was not! Or at least,
she seemed to forget about it when she saw the sick man.</p>

<p>In ten seconds she was in charge of the room and Hobo Durfee in
it. And before the first minute had elapsed, she had a bucket of
hot soapsuds and was giving that floor the first scrubbing of its
short but eventful life. She washed it until it dried white. And
then she washed the walls. And when she was ended with that, she
sent little Sammy Gregg forth to get wild flowers, and these she
distributed around the room in any receptacles which she could get
out of the saloon.</p>

<p>About half an hour after these changes had been made, with the
windows of the room opened, and the doors opened also, so that a
refreshing wind could pass through, old Durfee opened his eyes and
said in a tremulous voice: "Doggone me if spring ain't come
ag'in."</p>

<p>And then he saw the girl and flushed. He was not used to be
tended upon by ladies.</p>

<p>"Of course it's spring," said Anne Cosden, sitting down beside
his bed. "It was just about a year ago in the spring, too, that I
came by your house and you asked me in to have pone and strawberry
jam."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Hobo Durfee, abashed. "I disremembered for a minute.
But I guess that you're Miss Cosden, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>A wave of pain struck him. He stiffened and fought out the
battle.</p>

<p>"Lord, man," said Anne Cosden, "groan and that'll let some of
the corked-up pain out of you. When I was a youngster, I used to
take pride in not making any noise when I was hurt. I was always
spilling off a horse, you know, and breaking a collar bone, or
something like that. But after a while I found that it did a lot of
good just to lie back and shout when something hurt me!"</p>

<p>Old Durfee chuckled. He had forgotten his pain. And little Sammy
Gregg, noiseless as a shadow in a corner of the room, really
worshiped big Anne Cosden.</p>

<p>She flashed a glance at him and moved her lips in a whisper
which the sick man could not hear, but which said plainly to Sammy
Gregg: "Will you please get rid of that goose look?"</p>

<p>Then suddenly old Durfee was saying: "I'm beginning to remember!
It sort of begins to work back into my mind. I see 'em standin'
there outside the door of my cabin. And, oh, my Lord, they got all
my money! They got fifteen years that I can't never live no more
and they put them years of my life in their pockets."</p>

<p>Anne Cosden, with a consolatory murmur, put her hand on the hot
forehead of Durfee, and at the same time a slight nod brought Sammy
Gregg instantly to her side.</p>

<p>"You know shorthand, Sammy. Now he's about to talk, and you get
every word down."</p>

<p>"Paper," said Sammy helplessly.</p>

<p>"Darn it," said Anne Cosden, "write on the floor, if you can't
do any better!"</p>

<p>This was the fashion in which old Durfee told his story, slowly,
stretching his tale over more than an hour, for often the horror of
the thing that had happened would rush back upon his mind and stop
his speech. But always Anne Cosden, sitting beside him, soothing
him, letting him groan when he would, letting him speak when he
would, sympathetic, gentle, filled with intuitions of the right
manner of persuading him to talk, drew the story forth in every
detail. While, in the corner, unheeded by the sick man, little
Sammy Gregg writhed and listened and writhed again and, while his
teeth were set, his rapid pencil took down the words of the
sufferer.</p>

<p>He had a little memorandum book which served him. Presently the
memorandum book was filled with the questions of the girl, and the
responses of the sick man. And then he took out old letters and
scrawled upon the backs of the sheets and on the outside and on the
inside of envelopes, the utterances of Hobo Durfee which were to
bring death to so many men!</p>

<p>One might not have realized, looking in upon this scene, that
Justice was no longer a blind goddess but was opening her eyes and
beginning to prepare to strike, while that rapid, cunning pencil
made the swift signs which could be reinterpreted as speech.</p>

<p>The thing was ended. Old Durfee lay exhausted, but happy at last
now that the tale had been told. For, just as the girl had told
him, some of the pain seemed to pass into the groans and the words
with which he had expressed himself.</p>

<p>Then Anne Cosden, stifled with anger and grief, with tears in
her eyes and with her square chin thrust forward, nodded jerkily to
little Sammy Gregg, saying as clearly as words: "Now go out and let
the world hear what we have heard!"</p>

<p>So Sammy went softly out and faced the dense crowd which waited,
in a deadly silence, in the outer room of the saloon. Not a word
had been spoken out there. Not a drink had been tasted. But every
man had a pair of revolvers belted around his hips and most of them
leaned upon rifles, and in the street each man had left his fastest
and strongest horse.</p>

<p>At the nod of Sammy, and seeing the paper in his hand, they
followed him forth from the saloon. They gathered again in the
street around him. But he was not tall enough to let all their eyes
find his face, and therefore stalwart Hubert Cosden caught him up
and perched the little man upon one of his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>From this position, Sammy read forth his account, giving each of
the questions of the girl, and each of the answers of poor Durfee.
And there was not a whisper from that crowd. But every crook in it,
and there were many of them there, felt like an honest man when he
thought of the horror of it all.</p>

<p>They came to the end of the document. Sammy Gregg was reading
out of an envelope, crowded with characters:</p>

<p>"Miss Cosden: Did you recognize any of their voices?</p>

<p>"Durfee: One of them I thought I did. I ain't quite sure.</p>

<p>"Miss Cosden: Who was that?</p>

<p>"Durfee: It was him that come the last. It was the seventh
man.</p>

<p>"Miss Cosden: And who did he seem to you to be?</p>

<p>"Durfee: I disremember. A name come into my mind at the time,
but it's slipped out again.</p>

<p>"Miss Cosden: Don't try too hard to remember. It may pop back
into your mind again. What sort of a man was he? Tall or short?</p>

<p>"Durfee: Oh, he was considerable of a tallish sort of a
gent.</p>

<p>"Miss Cosden: Young or old?</p>

<p>"Durfee: Sort of betwixt and between.</p>

<p>"Miss Cosden: And what did he say?</p>

<p>"Durfee: First I thought that he was gunna take my money away
from them.</p>

<p>"Miss Cosden: Did you think that one man could take the money
away from six?</p>

<p>"Durfee: I dunno. He was sort of a leader with them.</p>

<p>"Miss Cosden: What did he say to them?</p>

<p>"Durfee: He cussed them out considerable and said that what they
had done was an outrage. You see, that was when I begun hoping.</p>

<p>"Miss Cosden: And then?</p>

<p>"Durfee: One of them up and said that now that they had turned
the trick and got the money that so many others had tried to get
and failed, that the chief might as well take his share.</p>

<p>"Miss Cosden: But did he take it?</p>

<p>"Durfee: Yes. I heard them countin' the money out and I heard it
go crashin' and jinglin' into his wallet, I guess! I turned my
head, and I seen him take it and I squinted hard to make out his
face.</p>

<p>"Miss Cosden: Didn't he have on a mask?</p>

<p>"Durfee: No, there was no mask on him. But there was a sort of
blackness runnin' around in front of his eyes and I couldn't make
him out clear!</p>

<p>"Miss Cosden: Was there anything else about him that struck
you?</p>

<p>"Durfee: Nothin' but his hoss.</p>

<p>"Miss Cosden: What sort of a horse was it? Or could you see it
in the night?</p>

<p>"Durfee: I couldn't of seen it if it had been any other color.
But it was a gray hoss and mighty big and upstanding, sort of. It
looked like a fine hoss. I could tell that much! A hoss that could
carry a big man, too!</p>

<p>"Miss Cosden: I think you're tired, now.</p>

<p>"Durfee: I'm sort of hankerin' for a little sleep."</p>

<p>Sammy Gregg lowered the envelope. "That's the end of it, boys,"
said he. "There wasn't any more, after that. He quieted down and I
came out to you. But I wonder if any of you think the same thing
about the gray horse that I'm thinking?"</p>

<p>There was an instant of scowling silence which showed that a
good many had a thought, but that they were unwilling to speak it.
Then Jack Lorrain broke out: "I'll tell you what I thought about a
gent that used to play a lone hand, but they say that he's been
mixing up with some of the other crooks, lately, and letting them
do part of his work for him. The rest of you know who I mean. He's
a big man; and he'd be the leader of the gang; and he rides a gray
hoss that's about as well knowed in these parts as the rider is
knowed. I mean, Chester Furness!"</p>

<p>There was a sullen roar of assent. Then another in the rear of
the crowd shouted: "Then let's go and hunt him up!"</p>

<p>There was another shout; a movement toward horses was stopped by
the thunder of Hubert Cosden: "You'll never get him, that way!"</p>

<p>They paused, itching for action.</p>

<p>Cosden went on. "I've seen gatherings like this before. A
hundred well-armed and well-mounted men all set on getting some
scoundrel. Though we've never had scoundrels quite as black as
these seven! But it always ends up the same way. We get hot under
the collar. We jump onto our horses. We ride like sixty through the
mountains with no particular end in mind. And, the next day, about
half the boys have tired their horses; there's no real clue before
them; and most of them troop off back to town and to work.</p>

<p>"The rest stay on a few days longer, perhaps. They hear a couple
of rumors, ride to hunt them down, find nothing, and then they go
home and say that it's the business of the law to handle these
affairs, after all. But there is no law here. If we had a sheriff,
we wouldn't have affairs like this one of Durfee. There is no law
except such law as we make with our own hands. And I say that the
time has come for us to adopt new tactics. Do any of you agree with
me?"</p>

<p>They agreed. A good deal of their flare of enthusiasm vanished
as he mentioned so many hard-faced facts.</p>

<p>"But what do you suggest, Mr. Cosden?"</p>

<p>"I suggest that we have one man to direct all of us. Better to
have one head, even if it's a poor one, than to have fifty heads
all wanting to do different things!"</p>

<p>Anne Cosden came out to tell them to make less noise, for her
charge was now asleep. But she remained to listen to the most
exciting part of the scene that followed. Big Rendell, the
storekeeper, walking with a frightful limp because of his battered
hip, uttered his advice in a roar that had to be heard:</p>

<p>"Gents," said he, "I know the man to plan the work for you. He
ain't a fighting man. But he's a man with brains. He can't throw a
rope, or handle a knife, or shoot with a gun. But he's got a head
on his shoulders. I mean him that brung the first big herd of
ponies from Texas, which was something we all said couldn't be
done. I mean him that pushed through the Munson-Crumbock stage,
after everybody else had tried it and failed. I mean my friend, Sam
Gregg! He's the man for you!"</p>

<p>Anne Cosden could not help smiling as she looked at the five
feet and eight inches of which Sammy Gregg was composed, and the
thin face, which the sun could never entirely turn brown, and the
nervous, eager body with which he had been furnished by nature and
never improved by exercise. Sammy Gregg seemed immensely
embarrassed and shook his head, and Anne Cosden waited for this
crowd of proved menkillers, many of them, rough frontiersmen nearly
all of them, to burst into a roar of laughter at the jest.</p>

<p>But to her bewilderment, they did not laugh. They did not seem
to take it as a joke, at all. And she was more amazed than ever
when she saw them nodding to themselves, gravely, and muttering.
Until Jack Lorrain said:</p>

<p>"That's what I call good sense, Rendell. There's enough of us to
shoot the guns and ride the hosses. We need a gent to sit back with
a good head on his shoulders and tell us what is the next best
trick for us to take. Here's Sam Gregg that has done what nobody
else could do. I say, let's have Gregg to tell us what is what.
He's our general, I guess. And we'll keep him off of the firing
line, if we can. He'll be headquarters for us. What you say, Sam?
Will you take the job of doing our thinking for us?"</p>

<p>Sammy Gregg was most reluctant. There were twenty better men
than he among them, he declared. And then he saw the astonished,
almost thunderstruck face of big Anne Cosden, and his own color
grew hotter still.</p>

<p>"But," said Sammy Gregg, "I've sat in the shack of old Hobo
Durfee. And I've had his pone and strawberry jam, the same as most
of the rest of you. And if you want me to take charge, I'll do it.
I'll do my best to bring in the whole seven of 'em, dead or alive,
but mostly big Chester Furness with a rope around his neck."</p>

<p>There was no doubt about the heartiness of the response. It was
a true, old-fashioned, Anglo-Saxon throated cheer.</p>

<p>Anne Cosden fairly staggered back into the room where her
patient was stirring fretfully in his sleep. For to Anne, little
Sammy had never seemed more than an imitation man before this
day.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch26" name="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI. &mdash; SAMMY'S
SOLUTION</h2>

<p class="first">They gave Sammy Gregg time to think out a plan,
and he went off by himself and sat down on a stump behind the hotel
and embraced his skinny knees with his thin hands and pondered his
problem, and watched a pair of busy hens foraging among the seeds
which the grass had dropped, under the surveillance of a lordly
rooster with a red-helmeted head and a cuirass of curious greens
and crimsons and rich purples.</p>

<p>It was only for a moment that he contemplated the strangeness of
his work and his place in that work. Then he lost all thought of
self, and his mind was rapt in the contemplation of the problem. It
was more than an hour before he called together the leaders among
the men, the well-known figures who were familiar to cowpunchers
and miners alike.</p>

<p>More than one of them, no doubt, envied him his eminent position
on this day and would be willing to scoff at his schemes. He must
win their trust and confidence first of all. So he stood with them
at the corner of the street and laid his plan bare.</p>

<p>It was more complicated than they liked, he could see that, but
the longer he talked the more willing they seemed to agree with
him. In the first place, he decided that the seven, having drawn
together, would never content themselves with one such act as the
robbery of poor old Durfee.</p>

<p>Big Furness was not the sort of a man to assemble forces merely
because there was a handful of money like this in the offing. His
own gains in the trade of highway robbery must now be mounting to
scores and scores of thousands. And if he called together seven
men, it was never for the sake of robbing a helpless old fellow
like Durfee.</p>

<p>For, as Sammy pointed out to them, Furness was a fellow who
lived as a road agent partly for the money but mostly, he had no
doubt, as a means of amusing himself. No, it was plain that he had
appointed to his followers some rendezvous near the house of
Durfee. He himself had been late and while they waited for him,
they had started out to make a little money on the side. And the
horrible torture of Durfee had followed.</p>

<p>But originally they must have been summoned to effect a raid of
a major importance. No such blow had been struck within the last
few days; therefore it was plain that the work for the band had not
yet been accomplished. It was still to do, and they could trust to
big Furness that the blow would most surely fall! If the
countryside were roused against him, so much the greater reason
would there seem to him to push his scheme through, no matter what
it might be.</p>

<p>With this in mind, what Sammy Gregg proposed was that they
learn, as soon as possible, how many of the men who were assembled
in Munson on this day could be relied upon to campaign for a matter
of a week, at the least. There were now more than a hundred under
arms. But perhaps more than two thirds of these could not leave
their work for a long manhunt. Better find out the permanent men
for the posse at once.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mr. Cosden would enter the stage and make the
journey back to Crumbock as fast as possible. There he would spread
the alarm in the same fashion and gather as many permanent men as
he could.</p>

<p>"Now," said Sammy to his new henchmen, "there's half a dozen
places where Furness' riders are apt to strike. They might tackle
Munson. They might try Crumbock. They might land at Chadwick City,
or Little Orleans, or Buxton Crossing. Or they might even ride as
far as Old Shawnee. Now look at the map."</p>

<p>He sketched in the dust with his forefinger as he talked.</p>

<p>"Here are the mountains in a lump, an armful, a hundred and
fifty miles across. Crumbock is fairly close to the center of it.
Munson is off here to the edge. The other towns are out on the
plains beyond.</p>

<p>"Very well. No matter where they rob, Furness and his men always
head for the heart of the mountains. That is their
'hole-in-the-wall' country. They hide there as soon as they can
after they've made a raid.</p>

<p>"Now, what I plan to do is not to try to herd them away from all
the towns, but cut off the line of their retreat. We ought to get
thirty or forty men out of Munson, and the same number out of
Crumbock. Then split those men into two sections each. That'll give
you four posses of between fifteen to twenty men each. Then post
each of the four in the mountains, in a square.</p>

<p>"Every side of that square will be about seventy or eighty miles
long. We'll put men here and here and here!"</p>

<p>He jabbed out the places on his rudely sketched map.</p>

<p>"Now we'll make no more noise about this thing than we have to,
but we'll at once send riders from Munson to go to each of the
towns where big Furness is most apt to strike. In the towns they'll
not speak a word or give any warning that we think that Furness is
going to raid. Because, so far as we know for sure, he may not
raid. But we'll have our men there, as messengers. Now, the instant
a raid is carried out, the messenger in the town that is raided
will ride, not on the trail of the raiders, but straight into the
mountains until he comes to that section of the posse which is
located nearest to his own town.</p>

<p>"When the word is brought in, in that fashion, the party that is
warned will give the messenger a fresh horse and send him on to
warn the other nearest sections of our posse. In the meantime, it
will have fixed in its own mind the most likely routes along which
the seven are apt to hit into the mountains from the nearest
town.</p>

<p>"And, in a way, you can say that we'll have Furness and his men
running right into our hands. Fifteen or twenty men, who know what
to expect, ought to be able to handle at least the seven men of
that gang. The advantage of surprise will be all on our side."</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a little complicated. Perhaps, also, it was a
little more selfish than a real sheriff's posse would have dared to
be. But the need was urgent. And the scheme appealed most strongly
to the imaginations of the men to whom Gregg talked.</p>

<p>There was one chief danger. They needed three full days in order
to set their trap. And if the raid occurred before the trap was
set, most of their preparations would be wasted. So the first thing
was speed in those preparations.</p>

<p>All was arranged with perfect harmony. In another hour, Cosden
was whirling away toward Crumbock to gather what good men he could
in the mining camp, and Jack Lorrain and others were weeding out
the volunteers of Munson. They got thirty-four men who declared
their willingness to remain at least a week on the job. Besides,
they were furnished with five messengers who were to scatter to the
points of danger exposed to the attack of Furness, namely, to the
five towns.</p>

<p>When that was arranged, the Munson volunteers were split into
two sections and marched at once out of the town. They only delayed
long enough to load up with plenty of bacon and flour and salt at
Rendell's store. And then they were off.</p>

<p>Anne Cosden waved farewell to them from the front door of the
saloon, as cheerfully as though they were off on a picnic and she
herself left behind among old friends. She had her own work, which
was to care for old Durfee in his pain, with the meager assistance
of Doctor Stanley Morgan.</p>

<p>But the rearmost rider of the second party that started for the
upper mountains was beckoned to by her. It was Sammy Gregg, who
rode over before her and removed his hat respectfully.</p>

<p>"Sammy," said she, "I hope that you're only riding out of town
with the boys to see them off. You're not going with them!"</p>

<p>"Why," said Sammy, "after starting a thing like this, I couldn't
stay behind!"</p>

<p>"Will you tell me," said Anne Cosden impatiently, "why you
should put yourself in the way of bullets when you don't know the
first thing about how to shoot back?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Sammy, "I don't expect that I'll be of any real
use when the bullets begin to fly. But you see, I thought that I
could be handy around the camp."</p>

<p>"Are you a camp cook?" asked Anne Cosden sternly.</p>

<p>"I can wash the pans, at least," said Sammy Gregg, and he rode
on with a grin.</p>

<p>"Young man," said Anne Cosden, "don't be silly and try to be a
hero."</p>

<p>At the head of that party from Munson of which young Sammy Gregg
was himself a member, there rode that tall and long-mustached
viking, Cumnor. It was he who had abandoned all such industries as
mining and lumbering and even cowherding for the reason, as he
said, that they were the sign of a new country, and what he wanted
to be in was a country which was permanent in its occupations and
in the returns which it yielded to good law-abiding citizens.</p>

<p>Therefore, he had established himself, after a time as a
rancher, in the smaller field as farmer. It was said that he and
poor old Hobo Durfee were the only real farmers in that part of the
world, and now that Durfee was unlikely ever again to till a field,
or afford to have one tilled for him, Mr. Cumnor stood alone in
that branch of work.</p>

<p>He was proud of this lonely eminence, and he was fond of saying
that the rest of the members of the community were no better than
mere temporary interlopers, whereas he was the forerunner of the
men who would make the country rich and great. The time would come,
as Cumnor was fond of saying, when those mountains would be
terraced high up their sides and thriving farms would throng in
every valley.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful sight to see Cumnor lay his course through
the mountains to the spot which had been designated as his
location. He had been given the post of honor at the angle which
was nearest to the two towns of Chadwick City and Little Orleans.
The warning messengers from either of those towns would find the
party of big Cumnor first. And now the farmer guided his band
swiftly among the growing peaks.</p>

<p>He did not need a compass to tell him the way. That was a trail
which he had never traveled before, but any old plainsman has
learned to stock his brain with all manner of landmarks and signs;
and when he comes out of the plains, where it is difficult enough
to find any sort of a mark, it is simple enough when he finds
himself among the mountains. For they are not to him what they are
to the uninitiated, simply great forms monotonous as waves in the
sea. Rather, they are so many faces, each with individual
features.</p>

<p>The general landmarks were so well fixed in the mind of big
Cumnor that now he led the party on with a perfect surety, never
pausing to make his reckoning at any point along the journey. They
crossed the first range of heights before noon of the starting day.
Then they swung down into a rough, narrow valley which extended
between that range and the next just off to the north.</p>

<p>The next day they labored slowly along through the mountains
with the yellow flannel shirt and the rigidly squared shoulders of
Cumnor in the lead. That evening they camped on the spot which had
been chosen for them by Sammy Gregg before the start. They were now
at one of the four corners of the square which the scattered posse
sketched across the surface of the mountains. And from that time
forth they need do nothing except wait from day to day for news of
the raiders.</p>

<p>So two lazy days in the camp passed away, comfortable days of
rest for the men with Cumnor, days of torture for Sammy. For he was
not one of those who are plentifully entertained by the sights and
the sounds of the great outdoors. If someone cared to sit down and
talk to him about the nature of the stones or about the trees and
their peculiarities, their ages and their uses, he was glad enough.
And there were many men who could make a most fascinating tale out
of the sign on the trails which crossed the mountains. However, if
left to his own devices, Sammy could only sit and twiddle his
thumbs.</p>

<p>Left to himself in the dreary silences of the camp, he could
only wonder if any success would ever attend this complicated
scheme of his, or would it be another of the failures which had
always attended every effort to bring back Chester Ormonde Furness
to the hands of the law?</p>

<p>It was on the fourth evening that the news came. They had
started the campfire to cook the evening meal. Cumnor himself, left
free from camp duties as the leader of the expedition, was walking
across a hill to the east of the fire, when they saw him pause and
then wave his hand and shout. A moment more and they heard the
rapid drumming of hooves. And after that, a horseman loomed
suddenly beside Cumnor, a man who talked with many violent
gestures.</p>

<p>It seemed that Cumnor refused to listen. He turned and led the
way to the fire, the rider still rattling forth news as he went.
But when they came in to the scene of cookery, Cumnor said:</p>

<p>"Thar ain't gunna be anything gained by savin' five minutes here
and now for the sake of confusin' everybody. A gent always fights
better and rides better on a full stomach, and without no hunger or
curiosity eatin' away in him. Now what I claim is best is for you
to set down here and roll yourself a smoke and tell us what news
you bring in from Chadwick City. Take it easy. We got lots of time
to listen and you got lots of time to talk."</p>

<p>The other dismounted obediently and stretched. "All right," said
he. "You're the boss. I can't turn around and catch the whole seven
of 'em with my bare hands. But sure as fate, they're comin' right
at you now, boys, makin' a bee line straight for where your camp
is!"</p>

<p>"All right," said Cumnor. "The straighter they come, the easier
it's gunna be for us to get our hands on 'em. Now you talk and tell
your yarn. Ain't any of you boys got any coffee ready? Are you
gonna make a gent talk with his throat all caked up with dust?"</p>

<p>Coffee was brought in a great tin cup that held more than half a
pint. The cigarette was rolled.</p>

<p>"All right, Cumnor," said the messenger. "If it comes to takin'
time and sippin' coffee and smokin', I reckon that I can do about
as good as any of you. I'll yarn it for you as much as you
want."</p>

<p>He proceeded to tell them how Furness and his six men had calmly
robbed the Chadwick City bank of more than two hundred thousand
dollars. No one had been killed, but the cashier had been wounded
when he tried to resist, and the whole town was in a furore.</p>

<p>The outlaws had taken the trail to the mountains, and he was
just ahead of them.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch27" name="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII. &mdash; ON THE
TRAIL</h2>

<p class="first">When the messenger had finished his tale, action
reigned. Counting the messenger, there were now nineteen men in the
party. And though Sammy Gregg was considered hardly of much force
as a fighting man, his counsel on the way might be worth as much as
any of them.</p>

<p>Cumnor, however, gave all of the directions for the hunt. He
decided to start moving at once, and he selected from his party
seven men on the best horses who were to ride well ahead of the
main group. They were to scatter out, each man a full hundred yards
from his nearest neighbor on either hand. In this fashion they
would sweep with their eyes an expanse of about half a mile,
searching that ground thoroughly.</p>

<p>The moment any one of these advance men found any traces of the
quarry, he was to turn about and ride at full speed to carry the
tidings to those who were in the rear.</p>

<p>There was only one difficulty with the plan, and that was that
if they searched at night and covered only a half-mile swath across
the mountains, they might miss the outlaws altogether if these had
turned aside ever so little from the main trail. Whereas, if they
waited for the daylight, they would have ten times greater chances
of spotting the outlaws.</p>

<p>But against that chance there was to be posted the great
probability that Furness would keep his men riding in short stages
all through that night so as to reach the inaccessible fastnesses
of the upper mountains in the first long and quite tiresome march
from Chadwick City.</p>

<p>There was at least one aid to the searchers. There was a clear
half moon which had arisen while the sun was still filling the west
with crimson. Now, as the day died, there followed a short time
when neither sun nor moon seemed strong enough to do more than
confuse the eyes. It was at this time that the search began. But
with every moment, as the west darkened and the moon rose higher,
it was more and more possible to see to advantage wherever the
mountainside was at all clear. Where the forest hung in clouds
along the slope, to be sure, nothing could be made out that stirred
inside of its shadow.</p>

<p>But they pushed west at a brisk pace, with the advance riders as
a rule just beyond sight of the main body, or only occasionally
seen as moving blurs in the distance. But still the moon brightened
and brightened, or their eyes began to grow more accustomed to the
light and to their work. Confidence increased, and the very manner
in which they held their guns had altered.</p>

<p>They had not continued a single hour, however, and there was
still a faint, faint rim of light to the west, when a rider slid
out to them from the front with hurriedly gasped tidings.</p>

<p>"I seen the whole gang of 'em, all ridin' in single file. I
could of drilled Furness clean as a whistle! Boys, we're gonna snag
the whole lot of 'em&mdash;come on with me!"</p>

<p>Sammy Gregg felt his blood turn cold and rush back upon his
heart, which was like ice in turn. And it seemed as though Cumnor
must have known what was passing through the mind of the
tenderfoot, for his first word was for him: "You've shown sand
enough in sticking with us this far. The gun work ain't your work,
Gregg. You keep back, will you, and tend the hosses? Because we're
gonna go ahead, here, on foot."</p>

<p>"Let someone else mind the horses, or else turn them loose. I've
come too far to miss the fun, Cumnor," said Gregg. "I have that
much coming to me!"</p>

<p>"Then keep along with me, kid. And try to do what I do. Which'll
be only common sense, and nothin' rash, I can promise you. Git off
your hosses, boys, and throw them reins. And if they's any of you
that's got hosses so poor trained that they won't stand when the
reins is throwed, let 'em stay behind with their hosses. Because we
got to have men with free hands!</p>

<p>"Now strike away, partner, and we'll trail you. Mind you, boys,
not a word spoke on the trail. Not even in a whisper. If they's any
talkin' that must be done, I'll leave it to myself to do it.
Y'understand? I don't have to tell you to remember to shoot low
when you see 'em. Remember that everybody that gets excited shoots
too high. There was never nothin' ever killed by a shot that was
too high, but there's been plenty hurt by bullets that come
ricocheting off the ground.</p>

<p>"That's all I got to say. But run silent on the trail!"</p>

<p>Then they started off, striking at once in a long-swinging trot
that began to cut into Sammy Gregg's wind in bad fashion. However,
he stuck manfully to his work, keeping his place just behind big
Cumnor. They traveled not more than a half mile in this fashion
when the leader threw his arm up to stop the others and dropped
instantly upon his face.</p>

<p>The rest followed that example and they learned the reason for
it instantly. Out of the moon haze before them they heard the
steady jingling of horsemen, the clicking of hooves upon the rocks,
the rattle of bits and curbs and chains and spurs; and then the
occasional grunting of a laboring, weary horse.</p>

<p>The posse began to crawl softly forward toward the crest of the
hummock which separated them from the view of the riders in the
hollow beyond.</p>

<p>Then: "What's that moving over yonder?" called a clear
voice.</p>

<p>To Sammy Gregg, it sounded very like the voice of big Furness,
and the chill returned upon his blood, even though it had been so
heated by the run up the slope.</p>

<p>"Nothing moving."</p>

<p>"Use your eyes, you fool, and back there to the right, they're
on top of us! Cut for the trees, boys!" A gun rang from the hollow.
And there was a hoarse, distant shout. Plainly, one of the unlucky
forward scouts of the posse had been sighted by chance and dropped
by a long-range shot. But there was vengeance coming behind the men
of Furness at last. To the top of the hill lunged the followers of
Cumnor, and they had before them a clear, short-range view of seven
riders plunging toward the trees which were just beside them.</p>

<p>The dozen rifles steadied for a brief instant on their targets.
They crashed. And three of the seven horses that reached the woods
were riderless.</p>

<p>Four were gone, however. Aye, and as the line of riflemen surged
forward, they were encountered by a spiteful crackling of guns
among the rocks on this side of the wood. One of the fallen men was
either stunned or had gone to his long account. But two of them
were determined to make the power of the law pay more dearly for
their capture.</p>

<p>Sammy Gregg felt a cut, as of a hot-bladed knife, across his
cheek, and a shower of crimson covered his shoulder at once.
Someone else in the posse spun around and took a staggering step or
two, and then went down. The rest dropped upon their bellies and
began to worm their way forward.</p>

<p>"Who's up there on the left?" called out Cumnor, as calm as you
please, while he sheltered himself behind an outthrust of rock.</p>

<p>"It's Jem Partridge."</p>

<p>"Partridge, darn it, what's the matter with you? Can't you angle
some bullets down at them from where you are and roll them over for
us?"</p>

<p>The side of the hill sloped sharply up, in this place, and with
such an angle of fire it was most probable that Jem Partridge could
send a few slugs of lead into the foes.</p>

<p>Presently a spark of fire glowed where Jem, without a word of
reply, had opened fire.</p>

<p>And then: "Oh, darn it! Boys, I got enough&mdash;lend a hand
here, before I bleed to death, will you?"</p>

<p>"Tell your pal to stop firing, then," called one of the
posse.</p>

<p>"I'll see you damned first!" called another.</p>

<p>"Good Lord," whined the injured fellow, "you ain't gonna leave
poor Thompson to lie here and bleed to death, be you?"</p>

<p>"You yaller-livered rat, Thompson. You was never no good. You
was always a quitter. I dunno how the chief ever happened to bring
you along for a job like this! No, you die there and be darned but
I ain't gonna&mdash;"</p>

<p>The voice was cut short by the crash of the terrible rifle in
the hand of Jem Partridge higher up the slope. And then they heard
Jem say: I guess that finished that sucker. You boys don't have to
be afraid to go in and keep that there Thompson from bleedin' to
death!"</p>

<p>But ah, how dark and how open was that hillside! And who could
tell if two of the three were really dead, or merely holding their
fire in reserve to make it count the more effectively as soon as
someone of the posse showed?</p>

<p>Then little Sammy Gregg said to himself: "What good could I ever
be with a gun in my hand for the shooting? But I can serve as well
as the next fellow to stand out here and pull their fire&mdash;they
can't know that it's only me!"</p>

<p>So said Sammy Gregg, with his knees turned very weak beneath
him; and he had barely strength enough to force himself to his feet
and stand up in the brightness of the moonshine. But he made his
way forward. He came safely through the perilous land between to
the rock behind which Thompson lay twisting.</p>

<p>"God bless you, partner," gasped Thompson, half gasp and half
whine. "You're a brave man. You'll have your share of heaven for
doin' this. It's right here&mdash;look how I'm bleedin'!"</p>

<p>His voice had raised to an hysteria of terror. But here were
other men now coming hastily after Sammy Gregg, ashamed of
themselves that they had let the little tenderfoot take the brunt
of this danger. Cumnor and another were quickly at work bandaging
the bleeding wound. And three of the men were sent back in haste to
bring up the horses. The others bandaged their own badly hurt man,
or examined the dead bodies of the other two, whom they had brought
down out of the outlaw party.</p>

<p>The division of the spoils had already been made among the
seven. And from each of the three captives, thirty-two thousand
dollars was taken in fresh, well-crisped paper money. Thirty-two
thousand dollars in cash for a single raid, a single half-day's
work!</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch28" name="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII. &mdash; FACING
FURNESS</h2>

<p class="first">They had learned from Thompson, in the meantime,
what the probable plans of the leader of the bandits would be. He
had intended to push straight in among the mountains, but if there
were any danger on the road and he were diverted from that purpose
he would turn straight about and take his men down toward the
south, and past Munson, and so on until they were lost in the
burning flats of the desert. This Thompson was sure of, because he
had heard the chief speak of the thing several times.</p>

<p>"South is the trail, then!" said Cumnor. "He's had his check
here. We'll ride south."</p>

<p>But Sammy Gregg, remembering something of the big, confident
nature of Furness, broke in on this decision.</p>

<p>"Go on toward the higher mountains, Cumnor," he begged. "You'll
find him there. He'll never turn back from his way after a little
defeat like this. He has himself and three good men with him.
Besides, he probably knows that one of the three men he left behind
may give away the news of the intended southern trail."</p>

<p>No doubt there was excellent good sense in this. Cumnor decided
that it must be acted upon. The horses were by this time brought
up. And the sound of the firing had brought in the vanguard. They
carried with them the man who had been wounded by the first fire
from the outlaws.</p>

<p>So the wounded and the guard left behind were four members out
of the party. Fifteen in all pushed on along the trail in the
pursuit of the four fugitives. The odds were greatly altered. And
on behalf of the pursuit the freshness of their horses spoke
eloquently. Those of big Furness and his men had received a hard
pounding during the course of this day and it would be very odd if
they would be able to creep out of the range of the posse.</p>

<p>Indeed, they could not. With the silver clarity of the moon
covering the mountains and showing them the way, Cumnor's party
came momentarily upon fresher sign until they reached a point at
which the trail turned off into four points, each followed by a
single rider!</p>

<p>It was the last desperate remedy, to try to elude the pursuers
by simply scattering, the usual vain attempt which children make
when the constable takes after them in the orchard where they are
enjoying stolen fruit. Cumnor instantly split his band into four
sections. Three were of four each. With himself he kept only Sammy
Gregg and another named Sid Lannister. And then each party hurried
on its way.</p>

<p>Sammy Gregg, however, was none too content. So far all had been
well enough. The rush of many horses, the creaking of much saddle
leather, the oaths and the murmurs had kept up his courage to a
fairly comfortable pitch. But this was now a very different matter,
three riders on a trail which might be the trail of the lion, big
Furness!</p>

<p>When he considered that one of those riders, namely himself, was
to his own knowledge perfectly incapable of handling weapons in a
pinch, why, what would happen to them should it indeed prove that
they were on the trail of the terrible Furness, and if he, Furness,
his tired horse being pressed too hard, should turn back and strike
at them?</p>

<p>That thought had barely formed in his mind when the wind blew
faintly down the gorge through which they were riding the rattle of
musketry, followed, at once, by the sound of exultant voices.</p>

<p>"That's Gavvigan and his boys. He started up that way," said
Cumnor. "By the racket they're makin' they've got their man, yes,
and he may almost be big Furness himself. Would they holler like
that for runnin' down any common man? I dunno. Anyways, there's
four of 'em gone and they's only three left. Push on, lads. We got
to do our duty like the rest of 'em. There's where the rascal has
turned to the right. We got him dodgin', now, and that's a pretty
good sign that he's about played out and that he's not far away
from us! Faster, boys! Wring the last stuff out of the ponies. The
last that they got in them. We don't want to be the last of all to
finish up our shares of the job!"</p>

<p>So they spurred recklessly through the dark woods just before
them, little Sammy Gregg with a terrible choked feeling of fear
that made it hard for him to breathe. But he dared not give a
warning, for the simple reason that it would make the others see
his fear so vividly. And if they saw it, what report would go down
toward the town and reach, at last, to the ears of Anne Cosden?</p>

<p>She would not be surprised. No, for he realized bitterly that
this was merely what she would expect of him, cowardice, weakness,
no manhood in body or in soul! So he said nothing but watched the
mad onward rush of the two riders. They had forced their way ahead
of him down the narrow trail, partly by their eagerness and partly
by the superiority of their horsemanship.</p>

<p>They were, in fact, a full five or six lengths ahead of Sammy
when they swerved for an instant out of his sight around a dense
clump of saplings, and in that moment the thunder burst upon
them.</p>

<p>Sammy heard a double report, as of two guns exploding in voice
and answer.</p>

<p>Then he whirled around the corner, plucking his six-shooter out
nervously. He was in time to see big Cumnor grappling with the
towering form of handsome Chester Ormonde Furness, while Sid
Lannister was, even now, toppling from his saddle; and in a trice,
under the grip of Furness, Cumnor seemed to break in two in the
back, then he was flung to the ground in turn.</p>

<p>Which left Sammy Gregg about five feet from the conqueror, with
a loaded revolver in his hand, which was thrust out straight at the
big fellow. Moreover, his horse was rushing him straight at his
enemy.</p>

<p>He saw the glint of steel whipped into the hand of Furness. No
bullet through the body would do the business, Sammy told himself.
There was too much of this man. A cannonball through the midst
might not dispose of him, it seemed to Sammy Gregg. So he chose the
head as his target. And, with the pistol thrust out, he strove to
keep open his eyes as he pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The roar of the gun and the sting of the gunpowder smoke in his
nostrils and in his eyes as he rushed past gave him a stunned
feeling, almost as though he had received a bullet through his own
body.</p>

<p>Then one pull was sufficient to bring up his weary horse, and
turning about quickly, Sammy Gregg blinked in wonder at the sight
of three riderless horses behind him.</p>

<p>Three horses without masters, and one of them the mighty and
famous gray whose long-reaching gallop had kept his master for so
long beyond the reach of the law.</p>

<p>But was big Furness down? Could it be that his puny
hand&mdash;hisGregg's&mdash;had dropped that famous chief? He got
down off his horse at once. There was big Furness rising, swaying
to his knees&mdash;Furness in all his hugeness of stature.</p>

<p>What happened in Sammy Gregg then he could not say. Propping
himself upon a weak arm, big Cumnor was groaning: "Your gun, kid!
Use your gun on him!"</p>

<p>But Sammy heard the voice and not the words or their meaning. A
wild, hoarse cry burst forth from his throat. Such a sound he had
never made in his life before, never dreamed of. He leaped in at
the giant and behold! The giant crumbled before him with a groan
and lay helpless at his feet!</p>

<p>There was an explanation of the miracle. All miracles can be
explained, and this explanation was that the bullet from Sammy's
lucky gun had clipped along the skull of big Furness and dropped
him stunned to the ground. And, still weak from the shock, he had
been unable to brace himself against even the light fury of Sammy's
attack.</p>

<p>Furness was down, and now Sammy was on top of him, busily
knotting the cord which was to secure the wrists of this famous
robber and destroyer of men. Two had gone down before him. Then
here came this wisp of a man and struck him to the ground.</p>

<p>Oh, great was that monk who wisely invented the black powder
that put the prince at the mercy of the commoner!</p>

<p>There beneath the trees he bound big Furness hand and foot, and
then tied feet and hands together, so that he could hardly stir.
After that he looked to his friends.</p>

<p>There was no use looking to Sid Lannister. He was dying before
Sammy got to his side. He merely opened his eyes and stared
vacantly into the face of Sammy Gregg, in answer to the anxious
question of the latter. Then, with a stupid smile, he died.</p>

<p>With Cumnor it was a different matter. Two broken ribs and a
badly bruised jaw were the effect of his grapple with big Furness,
and now he was rallying fast.</p>

<p>He even succeeded in struggling to his feet, and gaining the
side of Sammy he rested a long, heavy arm across the shoulders of
that little warrior.</p>

<p>"Think of it, Sammy!" said he. "Once I was wantin' to shoot lead
into you. How was I to guess that you'd ever be out here saving my
fool life and Sid's."</p>

<p>"Poor Sid is gone. Just see if that big devil is tied
securely."</p>

<p>"Oh, say, you could hold a ship with less. How are you,
Furness?"</p>

<p>"Well enough," said Furness. "And now, lads, this is a lucky
strike for you. There's more than sixty thousand dollars in my
wallet there. Take it and welcome. Divide it as you please. Only
let me get at that gray horse and away. I don't mind the wound,
it's only a scratch. Quick, friends, before the others guess
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the savagely crooning laughter of
Cumnor.</p>

<p>"Do but listen to him, Sammy Gregg. He thinks that we have been
out to hunt for buried treasure, the dog! Oh, he's a grand man,
Sammy. But a wee bit addled in the head!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch29" name="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX. &mdash; SAMMY A
HERO</h2>

<p class="first">Cumnor was too badly battered to assist, but he
could at least tell Sam Gregg what to do. The little man, by his
instructions, heaped up dried brush and then a fire was lighted
which he was kept busy feeding as furiously as possible.</p>

<p>"They ought to see that signal, if any of them are still in the
mountains above us there," said Cumnor. "And they ought to file in
down here to see the game we got in the bag. 'We'll have some of
them here before morning."</p>

<p>Two of the parties were in before the night was three hours
older. They had buried the men they had hunted down. And they
carried with them, from each, the regular division of the spoil
which the robbers must have made shortly after leaving Chadwick
City. All had now been saved with the exception of one share of the
loot. Of two hundred and fifty-odd thousand dollars stolen from the
Chadwick bank that morning and divided among seven pockets, a
little over two hundred thousand had been retaken. And the eighth
share might still be reclaimed if the party of four riders had any
fortune whatever as they struggled somewhere through the mountains
after their prey.</p>

<p>Of the seven bold men who had ridden into Chadwick City so
bravely and so nonchalantly that morning, four were already dead,
one was hounded across the mountains on a weary horse by four
active pursuers; one was a wounded prisoner; and the leader of the
whole crew was in the hands of the messengers of the law.
Altogether a most discouraging day for crime and for criminals!</p>

<p>But Sammy Gregg was the hero. They turned to him with a respect
that made him want to break into laughter, and when for the tenth
time someone murmured that the thing he had done had been very
fine, he could stand it no longer.</p>

<p>"Friends," said Sammy Gregg, "I can't let you go on talking like
this here, because it won't do! The fact is that I was scared to
death while we were chasing down the trail, just the three of us. I
would as soon have gone hunting lions as I would have ridden down
the trail of big Furness. Then I heard a crash. And the first thing
I knew, there I was riding right straight at Cumnor and big Furness
grabbing one another. I saw Cumnor broken. Then I couldn't do
anything but pull the trigger of my own gun. My horse was carrying
me right in at him.</p>

<p>"If I hadn't fired like that, I simply knew that I'd get a
bullet in my back as I rode away. I was simply lucky in having my
bullet land. And there's the end of the story. But I hope that I'm
not going to hear any more of this talk about how fine the job was.
It was poor Lannister that rode in and took a bullet through the
body that deserved most of the credit. Next to him, there was big
Cumnor, who grappled with Furness and then lived to tell about it
afterward. They get the credit, and I had the luck!"</p>

<p>He finished this speech with a deprecatory smile and a flush, as
one by no means glad of his lack of greatness, but very eager that
people should know him honestly for what he was, and not a scruple
more. And he was answered by a grave silence and by curious, bright
eyes fixed calmly upon him.</p>

<p>"Well," said Cumnor finally, "I'll be darned!"</p>

<p>"Me, too," said another. "It seems that it was only luck, after
all."</p>

<p>And a third said dryly: "Seems like all anybody needed was to be
there!"</p>

<p>"But," said still a fourth member of the party in the same
sarcastic manner, "that don't explain how you happened to run in at
big Furness when he was on his feet."</p>

<p>"He was stunned," said Sammy, frowning as he tried to
remember.</p>

<p>"Cumnor didn't know that Furness was stunned. How did you know
when you yelled and run in at him?"</p>

<p>"I was excited," said Sammy Cregg, desperately. "I didn't know
what I was doing."</p>

<p>The same solemn silence greeted him. Sammy withdrew a little
from his place in the circle of the firelight. The same grave,
gloomy eyes followed him.</p>

<p>"You see what the little fool is worrying about?" said big
Furness, speaking up at the same time. "He's afraid that you're
going to make a hero out of him and that then he won't be able to
live up to that mark."</p>

<p>But that explanation did not make Sammy any less wretched. He
only dreaded the manner in which Anne Cosden would laugh when she
heard this thing!</p>

<p>They left a small party in the mountains to bring the wounded
Cumnor to the other wounded, friends and enemies. There they made a
depot of all the provisions that they did not need and those who
had been selected by lot started back on the pleasant journey to
Munson.</p>

<p>Sammy did not wish to go. He protested that he knew a good deal
about wounds and the dressing of them and that he should be
detailed with the hurt men in the mountains, but they would not
listen to him.</p>

<p>"I got to send in somebody who knows everything about what has
happened," said Cumnor, "and you're the only man, Gregg. You got to
go in and telegraph to the authorities. And I suppose that the bank
over there in Chadwick City would be pretty glad if you was to wire
to them, too. I think that maybe you could find out if they intend
to offer any reward for the catching of the gents that walked away
with their money. You run along, Sammy, and do the best you
can!"</p>

<p>So Sammy was forced to head the party that started on for
Munson. No one talked about the work of the expedition to him on
the way down, and no one asked him what sort of a report he was
going to make. But now and again he knew that their eyes were upon
him and that they were smiling.</p>

<p>So, when they arrived at Munson, he went straight to the
telegraph office at the railroad station and there he sent off to
Chadwick the following wire:</p>

<p>Party under Cumnor, of Munson, overtook and fought the raiders
of Furness. Four raiders killed. Thompson and Furness wounded and
captured. Two hundred and twenty-four thousand dollars recaptured.
One bandit escaped so far as is known at present.</p>

<p>This was the legal truth, boiled down as small as possible. And
Sammy, glad when that bit of duty was off his hands, started for
the back room of the saloon to find out what had happened to the
ruined, scorched feet of poor old Durfee in the meantime. He went
around the back of the saloon to escape the notice of the men whose
voices he heard in the front, and just as he got to the open back
door, he heard the happy voice of Anne Cosden crying: "Who really
captured big Furness?"</p>

<p>"Sam Gregg."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" And her laughter ran like a thrill of poison through
the tormented soul of poor Sammy.</p>

<p>"I don't mean that. I know that little Sammy planned the trip,
and I suppose that he planned it very well, indeed! But when
Furness was captured, surely there was some sort of a fight, and I
want to know who were in it!"</p>

<p>"Well, there was Lannister. He was killed by Furness."</p>

<p>"Poor Sid Lannister. He was a brave fellow."</p>

<p>"Then there was Cumnor. But he was smashed up in the hands of
that Furness."</p>

<p>"Good heavens! What then?"</p>

<p>"Ma'am, there was only one left in the party that was trailin'
Furness. Only three in that party to begin with, you see, and two
of 'em had gone down before big Furness before the fight really got
good and started."</p>

<p>"Yes? Yes? Why are you stopping? It was hand to hand, then,
between Furness and the third man?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And the third man was Sam Gregg."</p>

<p>"Are you ridiculing poor Sammy?"</p>

<p>"Him, I would be scared to ridicule him, ma'am, after what he's
been seen to do on this here trip. He was the brains that started
things going. And he was the hand that finished off the whole job
that he had planned. He shot big Furness off of his hoss. And when
Furness got up, he ran in and grabbed him by the throat and knocked
him down again and tied him up."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" cried Anne Cosden. "Why, I have more strength
than that little&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maybe you have right now, ma'am, but when he gets excited he's
apt to go sort of wild, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Stuff!" cried Anne.</p>

<p>"But here he is himself."</p>

<p>And Sammy stood at the door with a crimson face that showed that
he had overheard too much of what had been said.</p>

<p>"Sammy," cried the girl, "don't think that I've been running you
down, only they're trying to tell me that you actually had the
courage to fight hand to hand with Chester Furness. And of course I
couldn't help laughing at that!"</p>

<p>Sammy looked at her through a haze. His face was so hot that he
felt that his hair must be scorching.</p>

<p>"Sammy!" cried Anne Cosden. "Do you mean to tell me that it is
true, what they've been telling me?"</p>

<p>"It was all an accident, Anne," said Sammy Gregg huskily. "You
see, my horse was carrying me right in. I couldn't do anything to
defend myself except shoot, and luckily it chipped him beside the
head."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Anne Cosden. "But no matter what you say, it was you
who shot him off his horse? And then they said that you fought with
him hand to hand."</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he got up off the ground. I was a little excited.
However, he was badly stunned, and so there was no danger from him
at all. And that's all there is to it, Anne. For heaven's sake,
let's talk about something else."</p>

<p>"We talk about nothin' else," shouted a strong voice, the voice
of old Durfee from the bed. "It was Sammy Gregg that bottled up
them seven spiders that chewed me all up. God bless you, Sammy,
says I!"</p>

<p>Anne Cosden, however, stood as one entranced, staring at little
Sammy until he ducked suddenly away through the door and was
gone.</p>

<p>"But," murmured Anne in a troubled voice, "then it means that he
really, after all, is not just&mdash;it means that he really is a
good deal of a hero!"</p>

<p>"Ma'am," said a gruff voice in answer, "when Cumnor comes in
you'll get the details. But this here Gregg is ashamed of what he's
done. He's afraid that somebody is gunna find out about it and
laugh at him. And I wonder if he's got you in mind!"</p>

<p>Sammy Gregg took his troubles off to the dark of the night, to
commune with them in silence.</p>

<p>When he returned, he made no rejoinder to the hails which he
received beyond a single terse word, and so he passed on down the
street, a lonely form. He entered the hotel and passed wearily by a
big hulk of a man&mdash;Rendell.</p>

<p>"Son," said Rendell, "did you ever hear of the old proverb:
'Nothing ventured,nothing get?'"</p>

<p>Little Sammy Gregg turned around upon his heel. "Now what do you
mean by that?" he barked out.</p>

<p>"I mean what I say," said Rendell.</p>

<p>"But why should you say it to me?"</p>

<p>"Think it over, son, and you'll see! You ain't so darned
mysterious as maybe you would like to think you are!"</p>

<p>With this, he hobbled out of the hotel and left Gregg standing
blinking behind him, with his thin hands hanging helplessly at his
sides.</p>

<p>Then, turning a bright crimson, he hastened out of the hotel and
rushed to the back of the saloon and tapped softly at the door
which opened upon the room where the injured Durfee was still
kept.</p>

<p>In answer to his tap, the door was opened at once, and tall Anne
Cosden towered above him. The red in his face became more fiery
still.</p>

<p>"Anne," he whispered, "I just came to see
how&mdash;how&mdash;Hobo Durfee might be this evening."</p>

<p>And Anne, who had seemed to stand there quite expectant a moment
before, now sagged wearily against the side of the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's all right, I suppose," she said. "I wish that somebody
would ask how I felt once in a while."</p>

<p>"But Anne, how do you feel?"</p>

<p>"Tired!" groaned Anne.</p>

<p>"I expect you are," said Sammy.</p>

<p>"Tired of all the men in the world!" groaned Anne Cosden.
"They're all such fools!"</p>

<p>Sammy Gregg groaned. Then he blurted out: "Anne, I love you!
Will you marry me?"</p>

<p>"I've been an idiot," said Anne.</p>

<p>Then there was nothing more said just then. Sammy looked
foolishly happy, and Anne was radiant.</p>
