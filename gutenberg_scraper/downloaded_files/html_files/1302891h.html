  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">Some men have an aversion to cats, others shrink back in
  horror from a third floor window and fight desperately to overcome the
  temptation to throw themselves into the street below. For others the mirror
  holds a devil who leers a man on to self-destruction. But for Hans Richter
  that cruel and puzzling light which he interpreted into E Flat held all that
  there was of threat and fear.</p>

  <p>If you say that the obsession of little Hans savoured of madness, tell me
  something of yourself. Squeak a knife-edge along a plate, or knife-edge
  against knife-edge and watch the people shudder and grimace. They also are
  mad of the same madness. Some men and women grow frantic at the rustle of
  silk; others may not pass their palms over certain surfaces (such as plush or
  velvet) without a shivering fit. Exactly why, nobody knows.</p>

  <p>There are undreamt of horrors in commonplace objects for some of
  us&mdash;Hans Richter had the advantage of hating and fearing that which was
  not commonplace.</p>

  <p>He played second violin at the Hippoleum. He had little spare time with a
  daily matinée and a twelve o'clock rehearsal every Monday, but he utilized
  that spare time with great profit, being a most earnest student of colour
  values, and, moreover, a worshipper of heroes.</p>

  <p>You had no doubt as to what manner of heroes qualified for his adoration.
  Nature had built him short and clumsy, with a pink, round face and blue eyes.
  She had built him cheap as a builder runs up a cottage out of the material
  left over from a more pretentious job.</p>

  <p>'Well buttressed, but poorly thatched,' he described himself, and indeed
  the great Dame had been mean in the matter of head-covering, for his hair,
  sandy and fine, was in a quantity less than was necessary. His moustaches
  were mere wisps, but in the shape to which he trained them you read his mind,
  his faith and his pride.</p>

  <p>He was a gentle soul, with strange and unusual views on lights, and a
  certain pride in his intimate knowledge of London. It was his boast that
  there was not a street in the metropolitan area which he had not visited, not
  a historic monument upon which he could not enlarge at length; and once on a
  more than ordinarily poisonous night of fog he had led Sam Burns by the hand
  from Holborn Town-Hall to Paddington Station, and never bungled a single
  crossing, never so much as mistook the entrance of a blind alley, though the
  fog was so thick that Sam could neither see his guide nor the pavement under
  his feet.</p>

  <p>Oh, no, he was no spy&mdash;he hated the Prussian, as so many Bavarians
  did before the war (he was from Nurnberg). He was German all through, but
  neither favoured bureaucracy nor militarism.</p>

  <p>They lived together, this curious pair, in a tiny house off Church Street,
  Paddington&mdash;in a neighbourhood of strange smells and of Sunday morning
  markets. Sam Burns was 'Mr Burns' in law, and entitled (did they but know it)
  to the respectful salute of policemen, for he was a naval gunner on the
  reserve of officers, and held the King's warrant.</p>

  <p>They had one quality in common&mdash;that they were simple men &mdash; and
  because of this No 43 Bebchurch Street was a haven of peace.</p>

  <p>For Sam directed such casual help as he could secure in his best
  quarter-deck manner, had a gift for spying out untidy corners and hurried
  scrubbings, a vigilance which earned for him the hatred and slander of the
  charladies of Paddington, and resulted in a constant melancholy procession of
  new servants.</p>

  <p>They sat together by an open window on a Sunday evening in June 1914,
  taking the air. Sam's lean red face was one great scowl, for he was reading a
  thrilling murder case&mdash;facial contortion was part of the process of his
  reading.</p>

  <p>'Murder's a curious thing,' he said at last, setting the paper down on his
  knee. 'I've killed men in my time&mdash;natives and that sort of
  thing&mdash;but always in what I might term the heat of battle. I wonder how
  it feels?'</p>

  <p>Hans turned his mild face to the other and stared through his gold-rimmed
  glasses.</p>

  <p>'<i>Herr Gott!</i>' he said. 'That you should talk about such subjects,
  Sam&mdash;who could think of murder on such a night? It is a night for
  thought&mdash;exalted thought!'</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly, pursing his lips and looking thoughtfully out of the
  open window, and upward to the patch of western sky which showed above the
  mean housetops.</p>

  <p>'G minor,' he said abstractedly, and Sam grinned.</p>

  <p>'You're mad on lights, Hans!" he chuckled. 'G minor!&mdash;what the
  dickens is G minor?'</p>

  <p>Without turning his head or relinquishing his gaze the musician whistled a
  soft sweet note sustained, and full of sorrow.</p>

  <p>Sam frowned.</p>

  <p>'I'm beginning to see,' he admitted, 'yes&mdash;that's the kind of light
  it is. You're a crank on lights, Hans&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The other swung round in his chair and reached for his violin and bow that
  lay on the table near him. He drew the bow across the muted strings and a
  gloomy stream of thick sound filled the little room.</p>

  <p>'Purple,' he said, and played another long note&mdash;a joyous blatant
  note of arrogant triumph.</p>

  <p>'Scarlet,' he smiled, and put the instrument back.</p>

  <p>'Lights are horrible or beautiful&mdash;terrifying or adorable &mdash;
  listen.'</p>

  <p>He seized the instrument again and sent the bow rasping across the
  strings.</p>

  <p>'For God's sake don't make that infernal noise!' growled Sam shifting
  uneasily, for the note shrill and menacing carried terror in its volume.</p>

  <p>Hans had the instrument on his knees. His lids were narrowed, his plump
  jaw outthrust.</p>

  <p>'That is white light&mdash;the devil's light&mdash;cruel and searching. It
  stares and shrieks at me. There is a beckoning devil in that light. You see
  it on the stage&mdash;I have seen it a hundred times. It strips young girls
  of their modesty, it reveals the lie, it mocks the <i>passé</i>. You can see
  them staring at it&mdash;blinded and yet staring, their white teeth
  glittering, their red lips smiling like children smile when they are in
  pain&mdash;it is the light of war, and cruelty and suffering&mdash;phew!'</p>

  <p>He flung the violin away and mopped his damp forehead with a big green
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>Sam rose from his window chair slowly.</p>

  <p>'Hans, you're a fool,' he said, 'and I'm going to put a B major match to
  the A flat lamp.'</p>

  <p>Hans laughed and rose too with the remark:</p>

  <p>'And I'm going to a ten o'clock rehearsal&mdash;the show opens to-
  morrow&mdash;<i>Gott!</i> It is a quarter to ten already!'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was not a happy rehearsal for the little German. There
  was a new American producer at the Hippoleum, a burly man in a grey sweater,
  who was quick to wrath, and had a wealth of unpleasant language.</p>

  <p>In the third scene the lights went wrong. Four specially erected electric
  projectors had been fixed in the gallery, and on a certain chord, at the end
  of a song number, they had to concentrate upon the principal, who was
  singing. And they just didn't. One wandered off to the second entrance. One
  wavered undecidedly too far up stage, and the other two did not appear at
  all.</p>

  <p>'Say, what's the matter with you?' exploded the producer. 'Are you crazy
  up there? Is this a joke?'</p>

  <p>He said other sarcastic things, and said them through a megaphone, which
  somehow made them worse.</p>

  <p>A hollow and apologetic voice answered from the deserted gallery.</p>

  <p>'Put all your lines down&mdash;now put 'em on the proscenium
  arch&mdash;now put 'em all together up stage&mdash;now put 'em on the
  bald-headed fiddler in the orchestra&mdash;'</p>

  <p>There was a gentle titter of laughter from the weary chorus&mdash;but it
  was short-lived.</p>

  <p>The bald-headed fiddler was standing up facing the light, his face
  distorted with rage, his wild eyes glaring like a trapped animal, as his
  clawing hands flung out at the light.</p>

  <p>A torrent of words, German and English, poured from his twisted mouth.</p>

  <p>'Take it off! Take it off! <i>Take it off!</i>' he screamed.</p>

  <p>There was an instant and a painful pause. The lights dimmed and an
  outraged producer strode down the central aisle of the theatre and confronted
  the second violin.</p>

  <p>'For the lord's sake!' he said, mildly enough, 'have you gone mad,
  mister?'</p>

  <p>The little man, one trembling hand curved about the orchestra rail, shook
  his head. He was very white, and the American, a judge of men, and kindly
  enough out of business hours, dropped his big hand on the other's
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>'You go right along home and have a sleep, son,' he said gently; 'don't
  you worry&mdash;go right along home.'</p>

  <p>'It's the light, sir,' faltered Hans, and blinked fearfully up at the
  gallery. I do not like the light&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Sure!' soothed the other; 'now you go right away and have a rest &mdash;
  there's nothin' comin' to you, son&mdash;on the square. I get just crazy like
  that myself.'</p>

  <p>Hans did not lose his job&mdash;he played second fiddle on the opening
  night of that brilliant success, <i>There You Are, Bunny!</i>and would have
  gone on playing through the inevitable run but for certain great happenings
  in Europe. A prince of an Imperial house was killed, and when the message
  came to six chancelleries six separate and distinct ministers demanded of
  their war offices, 'How soon can you mobilize?'</p>

  <p>Hans did not know this, but later he was to have misgivings.</p>

  <p>'I must go home,' he said doggedly. 'I am too old to be of any use &mdash;
  but who knows?'</p>

  <p>He looked wistfully at the red-faced Mr Burns, who sprawled across the
  table gloating over a newspaper chart which showed the relative proportions
  of the world's fleets.</p>

  <p>Sam looked up.</p>

  <p>'They'll want me,' he said with quiet satisfaction. 'My old captain will
  hoist his flag&mdash;he's vice admiral now&mdash;and he promised me that if
  ever there was a kick-up he'd take me. Who made the Penelope the best gunnery
  ship in the home fleet? Me, Hans!'</p>

  <p>He thumped his thick chest and his eyes were puckered with proud
  laughter.</p>

  <p>'I'm not too old for sea-going, but if I am there are lots of jobs for a
  man who ain't too old to spot a damned&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He stopped in confusion. The eyes of Hans were set and the dominant
  expression in those eyes was envy.</p>

  <p>'<i>Gott!</i>' he said with a sigh, 'I am no good&mdash;I hate war &mdash;
  it is terrible to think about&mdash;it is like the white light, a devil! But
  I must go back. Perhaps I may take the place of one&mdash;if He wants
  me!'</p>

  <p>He left the next day&mdash;an exhilarating day for Mr Burns, for he had
  received a notification that 'my lords of the Admiralty' had accepted his
  offer of service.</p>

  <p>Hans, with his brown ulster and his aged violin, came, packed his cheap
  gripsack and two brown paper parcels, paid his share of the expenses which
  were current, and went off in a taxicab.</p>

  <p>'Good-by, Sam.'</p>

  <p>'Good-by, Hans&mdash;good luck!'</p>

  <p>The little man's grief was undisguised.</p>

  <p>'I shall think of you&mdash;as a soft golden light, Sam,' he choked.</p>

  <p>'That's right,' replied his less imaginative friend, 'yellow for me,
  Hans.'</p>

  <p>Poor old Hans! So thought Mr Gunner Burns with a sigh...anyway, they
  weren't likely to meet. The little musician would scarcely be found amongst
  the ships' companies which the marksmanship of Gunner Burns foredoomed to
  destruction.</p>

  <p>So passed Hans, and as for Sam, after a spell at Whale Island teaching the
  young and impetuous naval marksman how to shoot, he came back to Somewhere in
  England to more important duties.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>There was a noise like the roll of a trap drum&mdash;an even 'br-r-r-r' of
  sound.</p>

  <p>Gunner Burns standing in the darkness, dropped his head sideways and
  listened.</p>

  <p>It was faint at first, but grew louder with every second that passed, and
  the noise came from the air.</p>

  <p>Sam peered over the parapet in a swift, keen scrutiny of the sector south
  of the position. Somewhere beyond the inky belt of darkness which blotted out
  the nearest features of the landscape was London&mdash;London the vast and
  wealthy, a gigantic, flat hive buzzing and droning, unconscious of the
  danger.</p>

  <p>As the watcher looked he pressed the electric button which was fixed to
  the wall near his hand, and almost instantly a second figure joined him.</p>

  <p>The trap drum noise was now loud and angry, and the men craned their necks
  and searched the skies through their night glasses.</p>

  <p>'There she is, sir!' said Sam in a low voice, 'the biggest they've got ...
  '</p>

  <p>The officer at his side had his glasses on the lean shape that blotted no
  more than two or three stars at a time.</p>

  <p>'What's her range?' he asked with the regret in his voice of one who
  anticipates an answer which will dash his hopes.</p>

  <p>'Three or four thousand yards&mdash;shall I light her up?'</p>

  <p>The other's hands had closed on the telephone receiver in the little
  recess beneath the parapet.</p>

  <p>' 'Lo&mdash;that you, Shepherds Bush? Zep coming over, I'm going to light
  her up&mdash;no, only one as far as I can see. She'll start circling in a
  minute, looking for the small-arms factory as usual...Right!'</p>

  <p>He turned to the man at his side with a grunted order. Something hissed
  and spluttered. Little bubbles of light outlined a big barrel shape somewhere
  in the rear of where he stood, and there leaped into the air a solid white
  beam of dazzling light which moved restlessly from side to side till it
  settled on something which looked for all the world like a silver cigar.</p>

  <p>'She's just beyond range&mdash;but give her one for herself, Burns,' said
  the young officer. 'She's turning!'</p>

  <p>The deafening crash of a gun woke the still night&mdash;a drift of smoke
  passed between the observer and his objective. As it cleared a tiny point of
  vivid light flicked and faded beneath the big silver cigar.</p>

  <p>'Five hundred yards short,' was the bitter comment.</p>

  <p>'She'll take some hitting! Keep the light on her&mdash;Shepherds Bush will
  pick her up in a minute...'</p>

  <p>WHOOM!</p>

  <p>The shock and pulsation of the explosion came to them. The trees rustled
  as though they had been stirred by a gust of wind, and the concrete parapet
  under the officer's hands trembled and shook again.</p>

  <p>The old gunner at his side drew a sharp breath.</p>

  <p>'Addlestone&mdash;that is!' he said. 'Fancy Addlestone! Good God, it
  doesn't seem real, does it? Why, when I was a kid I went to school at
  Addlestone...'</p>

  <p>Another report followed, fainter than the first, and then over toward
  Addlestone came a red glow in the sky, a glow which gathered in brightness
  until it was almost golden.</p>

  <p>'Them thermite bombs are pretty useful,' said the gunner with reluctant
  admiration. 'Hot! You can't get near a fire that's been started by one of
  them. I've seen men and women roasted to death by 'em, and they never knew
  what killed 'em. There's Shepherds Bush, sir!'</p>

  <p>From the south two white beams had shot into the air and focused instantly
  on the fast moving cigar. She turned to the westward, and the lights
  followed. She moved in one majestic sweep to the east&mdash;but the lights
  did not leave her. They were the two great eyes of the dark world staring
  their wrath at the night bird.</p>

  <p>'She wants that cloud dam' badly,' said the young naval officer. 'Put your
  light over the cloud&mdash;yes, it's big enough.'</p>

  <p>He took up the telephone.</p>

  <p>' 'Lo, Shepherds Bush...She's going for the cloud on the left. She's about
  level&mdash;no, I can't keep her lit up for much longer&mdash;she's getting
  beyond my range.'</p>

  <p>The sky shape was now blurred and indistinct, for it had reached the misty
  edges of the cloud&mdash;in ten seconds it had disappeared. But now flashed
  into the air not two but a dozen searching eyes. They grew from the dark void
  beyond the hillcrest to the south, slender white spokes of light that
  criss-crossed incessantly. The cloud glowed yellow where the beam came to a
  dead end, and once it sparkled at a dozen points, For all the world, as
  Gunner Burns said, as if some one were striking a match along its under
  surface and had done no more than raise a shower of sparks.</p>

  <p>'Shrapnel,' said the old authority approvingly; 'that'll rattle her a bit.
  Nothing like a nearby shell burst to make you take your eyes from the
  compass&mdash;there she is!'</p>

  <p>Out she came from the same cloud-wall into which she had dived &mdash;
  into the gleam and glare of the searchlights. Left and right, beneath and at
  the side of her the light splashes came and went. They were as soft and as
  sudden as the glow the fireflies make.</p>

  <p>The great machine turned again, her nose rose slowly into the air and her
  tail went down. The watchers could see the cloud of oily smoke at the stern
  as her speed increased.</p>

  <p>'She's got to climb for it, and climb quick,' said the gunner.</p>

  <p>A quick fan of light leapt up from the ground over by Golders Green.</p>

  <p>WHOOM!</p>

  <p>'A keepsake,' said the lieutenant grimly.</p>

  <p>The telephone bell tinkled and an urgent voice demanded his immediate
  attention.</p>

  <p>'She's going back to you, Carter&mdash;keep your light on her. She's
  twelve thousand seven hundred feet up and rising&mdash;shoot her off or
  she'll give you hell!'</p>

  <p>'Ay, ay, sir!' the officer swung round. 'Light her up!'</p>

  <p>Again the searchlight stabbed the dark, and again the cigar floated in a
  halo of soft radiance.</p>

  <p>Then from the north came a new sound. It was not the 'br-r-r-r' they had
  heard before, but a purring note&mdash;a far-off motorcycle could reproduce
  the gentle din.</p>

  <p>High above, the merest midgets in the vast space of starlit sky, three
  specks of earth-dust moved slowly across the field of the watchers' vision,
  and as they moved, in the limitless dome of the heavens a red ball of light
  lived and died. The young officer sought the telephone.</p>

  <p>'Three aeroplanes up&mdash;they have signalled "shut down searchlights,"'
  he called breathlessly.</p>

  <p>Two seconds passed, and then, as though one hand controlled the light
  shafts that swept the skies, they vanished.</p>

  <p>They waited in the dark. The never-ceasing roar of the Zeppelin engines
  neither increased nor grew fainter. She was cruising laterally for some
  reason&mdash;the Golders Green telephone explained.</p>

  <p>'We've hit her, sir&mdash;first or second compartment. Think one of her
  fore tractor screws is out of action...Yes, she got near us, but now she's
  drifting your way.'</p>

  <p>'Her fourth visit,' said Sam.</p>

  <p>'And every time she's gone straight to the place she wanted to reach,'
  added the officer with an impatient and wondering little 'ch'k' of his
  tongue. 'That fellow must know London like a book&mdash;he must know it blind
  to pick out his target with all the lights shaded and faked.'</p>

  <p>Sam nodded and thought of a certain Hans Richter.</p>

  <p>Poor old Hans! Fancy making <i>Hans</i> the focus of ten three-thousand
  candle-power searchlights! Sam grinned in the darkness.</p>

  <p>Three...four...five minutes passed, then from the sky shot a thin beam of
  light that seemed from the viewpoint of the gun position to be aimed
  horizontally from the airship.</p>

  <p>'Got her blinders on,' commented Sam. 'Aeroplanes are up to her
  level&mdash;there they are! Right ahead of her! They can do nothing with the
  light in their faces. She'll climb if she ain't climbing already.'</p>

  <p>Another minute passed. Then a speck of red fire appeared in the black
  heavens, another red followed and then a green.</p>

  <p>'Aeroplanes coming down&mdash;she's blinded 'em,' he said rapidly.
  'Stand by to light her up&mdash;keep 'em off the
  aeroplanes...<i>Now!</i>'</p>

  <p>From every point of the horizon the beams sprang until the sky was a thick
  jungle of converging light stalks. They beat fiercely, remorselessly, upon
  the big cigar as she zigzagged her way to safety and the north-west.</p>

  <p>A thousand feet above the guns the landing lights of an aeroplane burnt
  blue, and the great bird swooped to earth. They ran out to him as the guns of
  Golders Green began a frantic bombardment of the disappearing Zeppelin.</p>

  <p>It was Burns who helped the pilot to alight, and the boy who jumped to the
  ground was shaking from head to foot.</p>

  The airman was pinched and blue of face, but it was not his cold ride which
  had set him a tremble. He drank the cup of hot coffee they gave him, and as
  he did so his teeth were chattering against the edge of the mug.</p>

  <p>'Awful!' he said at last; 'did you see it?'</p>

  <p>'The Zep?'</p>

  <p>He shook his head impatiently.</p>

  <p>'No&mdash;after we gave the signal for the light, and they all came
  up&mdash;we were under the angle, and I looked up and suddenly a man&mdash;'
  he shivered and closed his eyes, 'a man leaped and straight out of the fore
  cabin...leaped and turned over and over...'</p>

  Pond by Addlestone one who had in his lifetime been Hans Richter &mdash; the
  man who knew London and hated lights. Especially lights that could be
  translated into E flat.</p>
