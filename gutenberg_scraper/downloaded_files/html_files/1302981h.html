<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Some of the puncuation has been modernised. The Index has been
added to the Table of Contents. Two tables in landscape format,
appearing as items Appendix II.&mdash;Table 22 and Appendix
II.&mdash;Table 27, are too wide to be intelligible unrotated; they
have both been split into two halves, as noted below.</p>

<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<br>
<p>A<small>NOTHER</small> Boswell would fail if he attempted to
tell, in the words of Arthur Phillip himself, the story of
'Governor' Phillip's life. Only some half-a-dozen years of his
career are fully known to us, and in that time Phillip worked
harder and talked and wrote less about himself than most men would
have done under such trying circumstances. From 1786, when he was
chosen to found the settlement of New South Wales, till his return
to England in 1792, his despatches and a few contemporary
chronicles&mdash;now become rare books &mdash;are the only sources
from which a knowledge of the man can be gathered. The chroniclers
were all officers of the settlement, and their books, like the
despatches, are but the dry bones of history. The Government of New
South Wales has been for some time searching for information
relating to the first Governor of the colony; but with such small
result that even his burial place remained unknown till the end of
1897, when the tomb was unexpectedly discovered in the ancient
parish church of St Nicholas at Bathampton, near the City of Bath,
by the vicar, the Reverend L. J. Fish. And the authors believe that
it may be taken for granted that, beyond what personal detail is
given in this volume and its appendices, there is little else to be
found. The discovery of the hitherto unpublished record of
Phillip's service under the Portuguese Government was made through
the persistent efforts of the Editor; the writers having, after
several attempts, failed to obtain more than the bald fact that
Phillip had served in the Portuguese Navy. Even his descendants
could throw no light whatever upon the point.</p>
<p>This book, therefore, is rather a narrative of the founding of
New South Wales than a biography of the colony's first Governor. It
ought not to lack interest on this account; for it tells the story
of the beginning of Greater Britain in the South.</p>
<p>Of the personality of Phillip, as we have said, little is really
known. He was an obscure naval captain selected by the Government
of the time to establish a penal settlement at the other side of
the world. He landed on the shores of a country which, to all his
companions, appeared a most forbidding and unpromising
land&mdash;one that 'would never be worth anything to anyone.'
Phillip, a few months after his arrival, wrote to England to assure
his superiors that it would prove 'the most valuable acquisition
Great Britain ever made.'</p>
<p>For these prophetic words alone, the man who uttered them, so
far as we can come to a knowledge of him, is worth knowing. Such an
understanding of his character as can be gathered by industry of
research, this book endeavours to furnish.</p>
<p>The writers are, of course, greatly indebted to the old
chroniclers, to the <i>Historical Records of New South Wales</i>,
and the <i>Official History</i> by Mr G. B. Barton; and (for the
use of papers and 'clues') to Mr David Scott Mitchell, the
well-known collector of Australian literature. The Editor's
acknowledgments to those who have supplied him with the materials
for the two Appendices dealing with Phillip's collateral
descendants, and his service in the Portuguese Navy, are separately
made. The portrait of Phillip is taken from the frontispiece to his
<i>Voyage</i>, a volume published in 1789; and the two maps
represent respectively the area of the first British Government in
Australia, and the site of the earliest settlement at Sydney.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p class="negindent1"><small>PHILLIP'S DESCENT&mdash;APPRENTICESHIP
TO A SEAFARING LIFE&mdash;ENTRANCE INTO THE NAVY&mdash;SERVICES TO
PORTUGAL&mdash;RETURN TO ENGLAND&mdash;A PERSONAL
DESCRIPTION.</small></p>
<p>C<small>APTAIN</small> A<small>RTHUR</small>
P<small>HILLIP</small> was the first Governor of the first
Australian colony, and this narrative of his life is the story of
the pioneers in that great Southern Continent where to-day nearly
every English family has a kinsman, and where the race has already
built a 'Greater Britain' across the seas.</p>
<p>The man who, one hundred and ten years ago, founded New South
Wales is almost forgotten, yet the country now in such vigorous
manhood was for the first half-dozen years of its existence a
miserable starveling, and but for Phillip's tender nursing, its
life would have ended in the year of its birth.</p>
<p>Arthur Phillip was born on 11th October 1738, in Bread Street,
Allhallows, within the City of London. His father, Jacob Phillip,
was a native of Frankfort, in Germany, who, having settled in
England, maintained his family as a teacher of languages, although
his former occupation appears to have been that of a steward. His
mother was Elizabeth Breach, and Phillip's father was her second
husband. Her first husband was a Captain Herbert of the Royal Navy,
who was, it is said, a relative of Lord Pembroke, and it is
possible that Phillip's career in the navy may have been influenced
in some degree by his mother's former marriage.</p>
<p>Destined for the sea, he was sent at the age of thirteen to
Greenwich School, in an old list of the boys of which his entrance
is recorded as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Date of admission, 24th June 1751; occupation of father,
steward; name of applicant, Arthur Phillip; age, 12 years; date
when left, 1st December 1753; period bound for, seven years; to
whom bound, William Readhead; ship, <i>Fortune</i>, 210 tons
burden, trading to Greenland.'</p>
<p>Evidently, however, young Phillip remained but a short time in
the <i>Fortune</i>, for at seventeen, according to his
<i>Voyage</i>, a work published in 1789, he was, at the
commencement of hostilities in 1755, serving under Captain Michael
Everet, and learning 'the rudiments of his profession under that
able officer.'</p>
<p>Six years later, at the age of twenty-three, he was serving as
lieutenant of the <i>Stirling Castle</i> under Sir George Pococke,
one of the best officers of the period. It seems, however, that he
found no opportunity of distinguishing himself in the King's
service, for about 1763 he 'found leisure to marry' and to settle
at Lyndhurst, in the New Forest, where he devoted himself to
farming and the usual pursuits of a country gentleman. Here for
some years he lived quietly, though doubtless awaiting the
opportunity to again engage in an active life afloat. But finding
that his own country made no call upon his services, he offered
them to the kingdom of Portugal when that nation engaged in its
struggle with Spain. His offer was eagerly accepted, and, as the
writer of his <i>Voyage</i> says, such was his conduct and such his
success that when the interference of France in 1778 made it his
duty to relinquish his position as post-captain in the Portuguese
navy and fight the enemies of his own country, 'the Portuguese
Court regretted his departure, but applauded his motive.'</p>
<p>No precise information as to the nature of his services to
Portugal is given by any of his chroniclers, but it is very
probable that much of his work consisted in organising the
Portuguese fleet to cope successfully with its antagonist. A decree
of the King of Portugal, dated from Lisbon on 16th January 1775,
and signed 'The King, DOM JOAS', and countersigned by the Marquis
of Tancos, commands 'all who shall see this, my letter patent, that
in view of the merits and qualifications to be found in the person
of Arthur Phillip, and feeling sure that he will faithfully
discharge any duties which may be entrusted to him, and also on
account of the confidence which I place in him on all the aforesaid
grounds: I hereby appoint him according to my good will and
pleasure (as by this letter I do appoint him) post-captain of the
ships of the line of my navy, in which post he will serve at my
good will and pleasure; and he is to receive double the amount of
pay corresponding with his rank. He will moreover enjoy all the
honours, privileges, liberties, exemptions and immunities that may
duly appertain to him: I therefore command Dom Joas, my dearly
beloved and esteemed cousin, a member of my Councils of State and
War, and Captain-General of my Royal Navy of my galleons navigating
the high ocean, that after placing him in possession of his post
(provided he shall have first taken the oath to faithfully
discharge his duties) he will allow him to serve and discharge his
respective duties. The Admiral of my Navy, as well as the chief and
superior officers, shall recognise him as post-captain, and my
officers, soldiers and others under his orders shall duly obey him
and carry out his directions in everything concerning my service as
they ought to be and are in duty bound. His aforesaid pay is to be
entered and registered in the proper books, in order that it may be
paid to him at the proper dates. In testimony of which I have
caused this letter, which is signed by me and sealed with the great
seal of my arms, to be issued.'</p>
<p>Upon his return to England he was, in September 1779, gazetted
master and commander of the <i>Basilisk</i> fireship. Again, as it
seems, no chance was afforded him of proving his worth; but his
superiors were now evidently beginning to recognise his merits as
an able and diligent officer, for on the 13th November 1781, when
he was upwards of forty-three years of age, he was made
post-captain of the <i>Ariadne</i> frigate, being transferred in
December to the <i>Europe</i>, a sixty-four. During the exciting
events of 1782 he was actively employed, and in the following year
he sailed with a reinforcement to the East Indies, 'where superior
bravery contended against superior force, till the policy of our
negotiators put an end to unequal hostilities by a necessary
peace.'</p>
<p>Phillip, during these services abroad, appears not to have
troubled himself with private correspondence. His personal
friendships, if he had any, were few, and there is no record of his
experiences and adventures in a stirring time, beyond the
dry-as-dust and scanty official records of his movements. And it is
probable, from what we know of the man's character as displayed in
later years, that he would shrink from, if not abhor, talking or
writing about himself even to his own relatives; in fact, during
his long exile in Australia he never alludes to family ties, nor
even complains of the fact that for the first two years he did not
receive a letter from his wife. His officers suffered from the same
anxiety as to the welfare of those they had left behind them, and
that was doubtless enough for Phillip. If his subordinates liked to
complain to their friends and relatives in England of the apathy of
the Government in not sending even a mail to the new settlement,
they could do so; he was too proud and self-contained a man to make
domestic anxieties a peg on which to hang even a just grievance,
and thus set an example which would have been contagious, and might
have led to the disintegration and even the decay of the
community.</p>
<p>One who met him in 1796 thus describes his personal
appearance:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Well I remember his little figure, smothered up in his brown
camlet cloak lined with green baize, his face shrivelled, and thin
aquiline nose, under a large cocked hat, gathered up in a heap, his
chin between his knees, sitting under the lee of the mainmast, his
sharp and powerful voice exclaiming, "I cannot bear this, I am as
sick as a dog!"'</p>
<p>This description of the man is not very impressive; but remember
the situation. Phillip was seated in the stern of a small boat
which was beating out of Mutton Cove, at Plymouth, in a strong
squall and nasty sea, and, to tell the truth, was&mdash;as the best
of sailors sometimes are&mdash;overcome with sea-sickness!</p>
<p>Had Phillip made enemies as did one of his successors in the
Governorship of New South Wales&mdash;Bligh&mdash;this incident
would, perhaps, have been made the occasion of saying that the
founder of Australia was notoriously unfitted for a naval command.
The military traducers of Bligh slandered his reputation by
asserting that he tried to hide himself under his bed when the
officers of the infamous New South Wales Corps deposed him.</p>
<p>Phillip was forty-eight years of age when he began the work
which entitles him to an honoured place among the Builders of
Greater Britain. Up to the year 1786, notwithstanding that the
Portuguese Court had expressed a high appreciation of the services
rendered to their nation by the British officer, his naval career
is scarcely worth remembering. His opportunities for winning
distinction with his sword were few, and if he had had them, it is
likely that he would have only done well where men with less brains
and more dash would have done brilliantly. This book contains
nothing but the story of half a dozen years of the man's life; yet
in those six years he founded Australia.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p class="negindent1"><small>THE INCEPTION OF THE SCHEME TO
COLONISE AUSTRALIA&mdash;MATRA AND SIR JOSEPH BANKS&mdash;THE
DECISION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO FOUND A PENAL
SETTLEMENT&mdash;PHILLIP'S INSTRUCTIONS FROM LORD
SYDNEY.</small></p>
<p>T<small>HE</small> causes which led to the colonisation of New
South Wales&mdash;Cook's voyages, the overcrowded state of the
English gaols (one consequence of the American revolution), the
proposals of Matra, Sir George Young, and Sir Joseph Banks for
forming colonies&mdash;can only be briefly referred to here.</p>
<p>Phillip has no place in the prologue to the story of the
establishment of Greater Britain under the Southern Cross, and it
is with Phillip only that this book has to do. Yet, for a proper
appreciation of Phillip as a Builder, it is necessary to give some
account of the share which those who were the architects of the
structure actually had in the undertaking.</p>
<p>Ask ninety-nine out of every hundred persons, 'Who discovered
Australia?' They will answer, 'Captain Cook.' The answer is, in a
sense, correct. but the brilliancy of the great navigator's fame
will lose nothing by the truth, and the truth is that he never even
saw the site of the first settlement in the Antipodes. What the
name of Columbus is to America, that should the name of Cook be to
Australia, and although Phillip and his transports can scarcely be
compared with the Pilgrim Fathers and the <i>Mayflower</i>, yet, as
the pioneers of settlement in Australia, the officers of the First
Fleet ought to be remembered as colonisers, with something of the
same admiration we have for those sturdy Puritan adventurers.</p>
<p>Leaving out of the story the Portuguese and Dutch explorations
on the western coast of Australia, something of the eastern coast
was known (although not to Englishmen) a couple of hundred years
before Cook's voyage. But Cook surveyed it and made it British
territory; and the publication of the narrative of his voyage
suggested schemes for its colonisation. One James Maria Matra in
1783, thirteen years after Cook's return from his Botany Bay
voyage, submitted a proposal for colonising the new territory with
American loyalists. Sir Joseph Banks, the naturalist who
accompanied Cook, was, however, the man who not only had most to do
with the matter, but until the day of his death in 1820 took the
keenest interest in the colony's progress. Banks gave evidence
before a Committee of the House of Commons which had been appointed
in 1779 to inquire into the question of transportation, and spoke
strongly in favour of Botany Bay as a place suitable for the
purpose. Admiral Sir George Young was also consulted, and after
many plans had been submitted and much time consumed, the
Government decided to take action, and then left it to Lord Sydney,
at this time Secretary of State for the Home Department, to carry
out a modification of the various proposals which had been
made.</p>
<p>That minister had to choose an officer to command the fleet of
transports and govern the new territory, and little is known of the
actual reasons for Phillip's selection. Presumably, however, he was
appointed on his merits, as he appears to have had no private
influence whatever with his superiors. On the 31st August 1786,
Lord Sydney wrote to the Lords of the Admiralty a voluminous
letter, dated from Whitehall, notifying them that His Majesty had
been pleased to signify his royal commands that 750 convicts then
under sentence of transportation and lying in the various gaols
'should be sent to Botany Bay, on the coast of New South Wales, in
the latitude of 33&deg; south, at which place it is intended that
the said convicts should form a settlement.' Then followed an
intimation that the Lords of the Treasury would provide means of
conveyance, together with provisions and other supplies to keep
these wretched outcasts of society alive, 'as well as tools to
enable them to erect habitations, and also implements for
agriculture.' A ship of war 'of a proper class'&mdash;how Phillip
must have writhed when he learnt that it was the wretched
<i>Sirius</i>&mdash;with a sufficient complement of officers and
men, and another vessel of 200 tons as a tender, was to be ready
simultaneously with the convict transports to act as convoy, and to
prevent the prisoners overpowering the military guards on board the
chartered vessels of the fleet. The letter is too long to be given
here in detail, though the great results that attended this
despatch of the 'First Fleet' lend it an importance that would not
be accorded to a mandate of the Government ordering a fleet away on
some warlike enterprise. The instructions to the Admiralty were
explicit and complete, but Phillip was destined to gain to the full
his bitter experience of red-tapeism before he sailed. The
prisoners were to be put on board the various transports at sundry
points in the Thames, whence Phillip was to convoy them to
Plymouth, and at that port he was to pick up another ship with its
load of felons. Further instructions were given that the fleet
should, at the discretion of the officer commanding the expedition,
call in at certain ports to provision and water the ships, the Cape
of Good Hope being especially named as a place where fresh supplies
could be obtained.</p>
<p>To secure due obedience and subordination from the convicts, and
for the defence of the settlement against attacks by the natives,
it was considered expedient to provide a small force of disciplined
men, and '160 private marines, with a suitable number of officers
and non-commissioned officers', were to be so furnished. Solemn
assurance was given that this force would be properly victualled
after their landing&mdash;a promise which was not
fulfilled&mdash;and another cheering intimation was given that such
tools, implements and utensils as this body of men would have
occasion for 'to render their situation comfortable . . . at the
new intended settlement,' would be duly forthcoming. Then came the
official chestnut&mdash;perhaps unintentional&mdash;for the marine
cats to pluck, stating that the period of service, 'it is designed,
shall not exceed a period of three years.'</p>
<p>With this letter was enclosed the 'Heads of a Plan' upon which
the new settlement was to be formed, together with the proposed
establishment for its regulation and government. It is unnecessary
to reproduce this document in full, but some quotations from it may
be given. The ships were to take on board as large a quantity of
provisions as could be stowed&mdash;sufficient at any rate to last
for two years. 'Supposing,' wrote Lord Sydney, 'one year to be
issued at whole allowance, and the other year's provisions at half
allowance, which will last two years longer.' The Government
'presumed' that by the end of that time the settlement, with the
live stock and grain which might be raised by the common industry,
would be able to maintain itself as far as food was concerned. The
difference of expense, however, it was added, between this mode of
disposing of the convicts of the country and that of the usual
ineffectual one, was too trivial to be a consideration with His
Majesty's Government, 'at least in comparison with the great object
to be attained by it, especially now the evil' (the convict
element) 'is increased to such an alarming degree, from the
inadequacy of all other expedients that have hitherto been tried or
suggested.'</p>
<p>The advantages likely to result to the new settlement from the
cultivation of the New Zealand hemp or flax plant were then alluded
to. The supply of hemp was of great consequence to Great Britain as
a naval power&mdash;the production of hemp by felons has a certain
suggestive humour&mdash;and already English manufacturers of rope
and canvass believed that the New Zealand material made better
canvass than that grown in Europe, and reported that a ten-inch
cable of New Zealand hemp was superior in strength to one of
eighteen inches made of the European plant. The Government had also
no doubt but that 'most of the Asiatic productions'&mdash;none were
specified&mdash;could be cultivated in the new colony, and that, in
a few years after its foundation, recourse to European countries by
England for such commodities would be unnecessary. The possibility
of exploiting the vast kauri forests of New Zealand for masts and
other ship-building purposes was next mentioned, such material
being designed for the use of the navy in the Indian seas. The
anticipations in regard to the cultivation of flax in the new
colony, it may be stated, were never realised, but the export of
timber from New Zealand soon became a great and profitable
industry, and has so remained.</p>
<p>Lord Howe, First Lord of the Admiralty, duly replied to this
letter, and in his reply said:&mdash;</p>
<p>'I cannot say the little knowledge I have of Captain Philips
(<i>sic</i>) would have led me to select him for a service of this
complicated nature. But as you are satisfied of his ability, and I
conclude he will be taken under your direction, I presume it will
not be unreasonable to move the King for having His Majesty's
pleasure signified to the Admiralty for these purposes as soon as
you see proper, that no time may be lost in making the requisite
preparations for the voyage.'</p>
<p>This correspondence throws no light on the reasons for the
appointment of Phillip. The position was one which it was scarcely
likely many importunate friends of the Government would clamour
for, and as the management of the colonisation scheme was
practically left by Pitt and his Cabinet in the hands of their
colleague, the Home Secretary, in the absence of evidence to the
contrary. Lord Sydney should have the credit of having selected
Phillip solely on his merits.</p>

<br>
<small>Map of the Eastern Half of Australia, shewing extent of
Phillip's Government, 1787.</small></p>
<br>
<p>On the 12th October, the Lords of the Admiralty informed the
Home Office that 'in obedience to His Majesty's commands, we
immediately ordered the <i>Sirius</i>, one of His Majesty's ships
of the sixth rate, with a proper vessel for a tender, to be fitted
for this service; and . . . the ship will be ready to receive men
by the end of this month.'</p>
<p>On the same date Phillip received a short commission appointing
him Governor of New South Wales, but this was afterwards replaced
by a longer and more formal document.</p>
<p>This last commission, dated 2d April 1787, appointed Arthur
Phillip, Esquire, 'to be our Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief
in and over our territory called New South Wales, extending from
the Northern Cape or extremity of the coast called Cape York, in
the latitude of 10 degrees 37 minutes south, to the southern
extremity of the said territory of New South Wales or South Cape,
in the latitude of 43 degrees 39 minutes south, and of all the
country inland westward as far as the 135th degree of east
longitude, reckoning from the meridian of Greenwich, including all
the islands adjacent in the Pacific Ocean, within the latitudes
aforesaid, etc., etc.'</p>
<p>A reference to the map of Australia will show that the territory
which Phillip was appointed to govern included about half the
continent. It was not until ten years later that Van Diemen's Land
(now Tasmania) was proved by Bass to be an island, and the 'South
Cape' named in the commission, and still the name of the
southernmost point of Tasmania, when Phillip's commission was
drawn, was supposed to be part of the continent.</p>
<p>The commission, which gave Phillip all the usual powers, a short
Act of Parliament, an Order in Council, the Letters Patent
constituting the Courts of Law, and a Letter of Instructions, were
all that the Governor had to guide him in conducting the enterprise
to a successful issue.</p>
<p>The 'Instructions' order the Governor 'to fit himself with all
convenient speed', and land the 600 male and 180 female convicts,
intended to form the new colony, as soon as possible at Botany Bay.
Teneriffe, Rio de Janeiro, and the Cape of Good Hope are named as
places where the ships were to refresh on their way out, and
seed-grain and live stock were to be taken on board. The Governor
is enjoined to be expeditious in getting the land into cultivation,
to practise economy, to explore the coasts, to reserve ample land
for further batches of convicts which were to follow, to protect
the natives and endeavour to conciliate them, and to do many other
things, which, when they are of interest, will be referred to
hereafter. The concluding paragraph says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'And whereas it is our royal intention that every sort of
intercourse between the intended settlement at Botany Bay, or other
place which may be hereafter established on the coast of New South
Wales and its dependencies, and the settlements of our East India
Company, as well as the coast of China, and the islands situated in
that part of the world, to which any intercourse has been
established by any European nation, should be prevented by every
possible means: It is our royal will and pleasure that you do not
on any account allow craft of any sort to be built for the use of
private individuals which might enable them to effect such
intercourse, and that you do prevent any vessels which may at any
time hereafter arrive at the said settlement from any of the ports
before mentioned from having communication with any of the
inhabitants residing within your Government, without first
receiving especial permission from you for that purpose.'</p>
<p>This was penned only one hundred and twelve years ago. Now,
besides the Orient, the Peninsular and Oriental, and the many other
steamship lines running magnificent vessels to 'the settlement',
there are two German companies, a French and a Japanese company
carrying on a regular service, and 10,000 ton steamers are
dry-docked and floated again within twenty-four hours at a part of
'the settlement' which, long after Phillip landed in it, remained
unpeopled.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p class="negindent1"><small>PREPARATIONS FOR THE
VOYAGE&mdash;OFFICIAL BLUNDERS&mdash;PHILLIP'S
FORESIGHT&mdash;PITIABLE CONDITION OF THE CONVICTS.</small></p>
<p>P<small>HILLIP</small> was not long in getting to work, and his
capacity for detail early began to show itself. A month after his
appointment he is found writing letters to the Admiralty asking for
small things essential to success, which only the man held directly
responsible for results appears to have remembered.</p>
<p>Here for instance is his first letter, spelling and all (a
practice which will generally be followed in future) as he wrote
it:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="right">'<small><small>[LONDON,]</small> Oct. 31<i>st</i>,
1786.</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>'S<small>IR</small>,&mdash;The Right Honourable the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty having ordered His Majesty's ship
<i>Sirius</i>, under my command, to be supply'd with six caronades
and four six-pounders, I am to request that you will please to move
their Lordships to order ten more of the six-pounders to be put on
board, with the ironwork necessary for the cariages. Having the
ironwork, the guns can at any time be mounted, and may, I presume,
in future be of great use to us, on board or on shore, as the
service may require,&mdash;I have, etc.,</p>
<p align="right">'A. P<small>HILLIP.'</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>This letter is of itself too trivial to be worth reprinting, but
this formidable armament formed the colony's first fortress
battery, and one of the guns still remains, a forgotten relic,
mounted near the South Head Light (which is the best coast light in
the world) at Sydney. By way of contrast to this, let us see how
the authorities provided for things of importance. Lieutenant
Philip Gidley King, second lieutenant of the <i>Sirius</i>,
afterwards himself a Governor of New South Wales, kept a journal.
This officer's grandson is now a member of the Legislative Council
of New South Wales, and the hon. member has placed his
grandfather's journal at the disposal of the public.</p>
<p>The <i>Sirius</i> was of 20 guns, 612 tons, and 160 men. She was
commissioned on 24th October 1786, Phillip being appointed to the
chief command as first captain, while John Hunter acted as second
captain. The last officer was so appointed that he might command
the ship when Phillip took up his shore duties. Says
King:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The construction of a King's ship not being deemed proper for
this service, the <i>Berwick</i> storeship was pitched on by the
Admiralty, and her name changed to the <i>Sirius</i>, so called
from the bright star in ye southern constellation of the Great Dog.
She had been purchased on the stocks by the Government in 1781, and
was sent once to America as a storeship during ye war, and once
after the peace to ye W't Indies, since which time she had layn in
ordinary at Deptford, till named for this service, when she was
taken into dock, and, as the yard people said, thoroughly
overhauled; however, we have frequently had reason to think
otherwise in the course of our voyage. The <i>Supply</i>, armed
tender of 170 tons, 8 guns, and 50 men, commanded by Lieutenant H.
L. Ball, was formerly a navy transport; her size is much too small
for so long a voyage, which, added to her not being able to carry
any quantity of provisions, and her sailing very ill, renders her a
very improper vessel for this service.' But, bad as were the
sailing qualities of the <i>Supply</i>, she was a faster ship than
the <i>Sirius</i>.</p>
<p>A constant stream of letters from Phillip to the Admiralty went
on from October 1786 to the sailing of the fleet from Spithead in
the following May. All these letters show that to Phillip alone is
due the credit of properly preparing the expedition. The Government
left everything to Lord Sydney, and he left the details of
equipment entirely to Phillip, who did not pass on the
responsibility to his subordinates. The circumlocution branch of
the Admiralty must have been maddened by his persistence. For
example, in December he writes a letter containing fourteen
questions relating to what, to officialdom, no doubt appeared most
trivial matters, but which the questioner's instinct told him it
would be wise to have settled before he left England. The
contractors, dockyard officials and others charged with the task of
preparing the expedition seem to have neglected their duties, and
their superiors to have exercised no supervision over them. Yet,
owing to his wonderful foresight and his steady 'pegging away' at
the officials, Phillip did succeed in getting many things that he
wanted. Just before leaving England, he wrote a memorandum on the
general conduct of the expedition and the treatment of the
convicts. Some paragraphs of this document are worth printing, for
they depict him in another character than that of an excellent man
of business:&mdash;</p>
<p>'During the passage, when light airs or calms permit it, I shall
visit the transports to see that they (the convicts) are kept clean
and receive the allowance ordered by Government; and at these times
I shall endeavour to make them sensible of their situation, and
that their happiness or misery is in their own hands,&mdash;that
those who behave well will be rewarded by being allow'd to work
occasionally on the small lotts of land set apart for them, and
which they will be put in possession of at the expiration of the
time for which they are transported. . . .</p>
<p>'As I would not wish convicts to lay the foundations of an
empire, I think they should ever remain separated from the
garrison, and other settlers that may come from Europe, and not be
allowed to mix with them, even after the 7 or 14 years for which
they are transported may be expired.</p>
<p>'The laws of this country will, of course, be introduced in
[New] South Wales, and there is one that I would wish to take place
from the moment His Majesty's forces take possession of the
country: That there can be no slavery in a free land, and
consequently no slaves.'</p>
<p>In other letters he asked for specific instructions on important
questions which his good sense warned him would demand an answer
before long, but which do not seem to have occurred to the Home
Government until he thought of them. He made a primary and most
fortunate suggestion that the choice of a selection for the site of
the new settlement should be left to his own judgment; that the
terms by which lands were to be granted should be pointed out by
the article which conferred on him the authority for granting such
lands; that he should have the right to exile to New Zealand or any
of the neighbouring islands any convict who might be condemned to
death; that he should have the power of emancipation; and that he
should be able to suspend and send home any officer who from his
situation could not be tried by court-martial. He further asked
that he should be authorised to despatch one of the ships of the
fleet to Charlotte Sound in New Zealand to procure flax-plants; and
his, and indeed the Government's, lack of knowledge of the climatic
conditions of the new territory is evinced by his request that he
should also be allowed to send a ship to the Friendly Islands (the
Tongan Archipelago) for the purpose of importing thence the
bread-fruit plant. And the worthy people who do not consider the
exigencies of empire-building and the laws of nature, will be
shocked to learn that Phillip, a man of the most stringent
morality, mentioned the fact that at the Friendly Islands 'women
could be procured.' In the same letter he asked that the Secretary
of State should empower him, in case the <i>Sirius</i> should
return to England, to take command of any other ships that might
remain on the coast, by hoisting a distinguishing pendant on such
ships, so that he might retain the command at sea and be able to
explore the coast. And to this request he adds that he has no
desire to claim the pay of a commanding officer for hoisting such
pendant. His forethought and humanity are shown by such demands as
that he should 'have power to change the species of provisions
served to the marines and convicts, for if salt meat is issued,
without any proportion of flour, as has been hitherto done by the
contractor to the marines embarked on board the <i>Alexander</i>,
the scurvy must prove fatal to the greatest part. Of the marines
already embarked two months, one in six are sent to the hospital
since that ship's arrival at Spithead.'</p>
<p>The Government, as a matter of fact, was too busy with the
impeachment of Warren Hastings to trouble itself with trifles of
this kind&mdash;for the despatch of a fleet of convict transports,
even though it was to colonise new territory, was regarded as a
trifle at this time. No single page of history recorded it, even
the <i>Annual Register</i> did not think it worth an entry.</p>
<p>To some of Phillip's wise and well-considered suggestions, the
Government responded that upon the death or suspension of any civil
officer he was at liberty to appoint any 'proper person' in his
place until His Majesty's pleasure was known; that he could send a
suspended officer to England by the first opportunity&mdash;with
his reasons for such suspension; that the Government would not
object to his choice for the site of the principal settlement, but
he was to understand that he was not to be allowed to delay the
disembarkation of the establishment upon his arrival on the coast
upon the pretence of searching after a more eligible place than
Botany Bay.</p>
<p>If Phillip felt insulted at this dictum he was too good a
disciplinarian himself to show it. The Government's chief anxiety
was to get rid of a batch of convicts&mdash;it was Phillip's desire
to effect that riddance in a humane manner, to treat them as human
beings, and to endeavour to make them reclaim themselves when they
reached their destination.</p>
<p>In this same letter Lord Sydney told Phillip that Parliament
would be moved to fix his salary as Governor at &pound;1000 per
annum nett, which, 'with the pay of the <i>Sirius</i>, is judged to
be a proper allowance for the support of the stations you are
appointed to fill.' The astounding generosity of the Government was
further exemplified by allowing him a contingent charge of five
shillings a day for the pay of a secretary, and the magnificent sum
of &pound;20 per annum for stationery. His request to be granted
table money was curtly refused.</p>
<p>Two letters, written at the last moment, show how much was left
undone when the fleet sailed. On the 12th of March Phillip wrote to
Lord Sydney, telling him that the Navy Board had informed him that
no alterations could be made as regarded the victualling of the
Marines during the passage, despite his earnest entreaties. 'It
is,' he wrote, 'to prevent my character as an officer from being
called in question, should the consequences I fear be realized that
I once more trouble your Lordship on this subject.' The contracts
for the garrison and convicts, he remarked, were made without even
his advice or opinion being asked, and he had repeatedly pointed
out the serious consequences that might be looked for from so many
men being crowded in such a small space for so long a period and
from the wretched scale of victuals. Flour, which was always
allowed marines in the navy, was refused him. 'This,' he pleaded,
'must be fatal to many, and the more so as no anti-scorbutics are
allowed on board the transports for either marine or convict; in
fact, my Lord, the garrison and convicts are sent to the extremity
of the globe as they would be sent to America&mdash;a six weeks'
passage.' Then in dignified words he went on to say that he could
foresee the critical situation he might be in after losing part of
the garrison, which even then he considered to be very weak for the
arduous service it was to undergo; but he was prepared, he said, to
meet difficulties, and had but one fear&mdash;that it might be said
some day that he should have known that it was more than probable
that he would lose half the garrison and convicts, crowded as they
were, and so badly victualled for such a long and trying voyage.
'And,' he concluded, 'the public, believing it rested with me, may
impute to my ignorance or inattention what I have never been
consulted in, and which never coincided with my ideas, to avoid
which is the purport of this letter; and I flatter myself your
Lordship will hereafter point out the situation in which I have
stood thro' the whole of this business should it ever be
necessary.'</p>
<p>In the second letter he begs for more 'cloaths' for the
unfortunate convicts; and that as more prisoners were to be sent on
board the different ships the Government would give orders that
before leaving the gaols or hulks they should be 'washed and
cloathed'. Then he alludes in indignant terms to the condition of
the unfortunate female convicts on board the transport <i>Lady
Penrhyn</i>. 'The situation in which the magistrates sent the women
on board . . . stamps them with infamy&mdash;almost naked and so
very filthy that nothing but clothing them could have prevented
them from perishing.' The clothing for these women he provided
himself from the stores on the <i>Sirius</i>, and asked that the
Navy Board would replace it, for their deplorable state filled him
with horror and indignation. As it was, a fever had already broken
out among them. Many of them were suffering from special complaints
which, he wrote, 'must spread in spite of every precaution I may
take hereafter, and will be fatal to themselves. There is a
necessity for doing something for the young man who is on board
that ship as surgeon, or I fear that we shall lose him, and then a
hundred women will be left without any assistance, several of them
with child. Let me repeat my desire that orders immediately may be
given to increase the convict allowance of bread; 16 lb. of bread
for 42 days is very little. . . .</p>
<p>'This is a long letter, but it is my duty to repeat complaints
that may be redressed, and which I am certain you desire equally
with myself.'</p>
<p>It was the same old story, better remembered in connection with
a greater man&mdash;Wellington fighting his campaigns in spite of
the Government, and without the assistance which he legitimately
required.</p>
<p>On the 7th May, the senior officer joined the First Fleet at
Portsmouth. The ships were lying off the Motherbank, a spot where
little more than a hundred years later, on the 26th June 1897, the
naval might of the greatest Empire the world has ever known was
displayed in five lines of modern warships which, anchored closely
together as they were, covered a distance of five-and-twenty miles!
Within a stone's throw of Phillip's little fleet lay the
weed-covered timbers of the <i>Royal George</i>; from the same
spot, twenty years after Phillip left for Australia, Nelson sailed
on his last fateful but glorious voyage in the <i>Victory</i>. The
<i>Victory</i> remains afloat in Portsmouth harbour, a speaking
memento of Nelson's career; and the British community of the
Australasian colonies is a great and living tribute to the work of
the obscure naval officer who laid the foundations of a new Empire
beyond the seas.</p>
<p>Contrary winds and other obstacles kept the fleet at its
anchorage for another five days. One cause of the delay, and how
Phillip removed it, is thus described by Collins:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The sailors on the transports refused to proceed to sea unless
they should be paid their wages up to the time of their departure,
alleging as a ground for their refusal that they were in want of
many articles necessary for so long a voyage. The custom of their
employ, however, being against a demand which yet appeared
reasonable. Captain Phillip directed the different masters to put
such of their people as refused to proceed with them to sea on
board the <i>Hy&aelig;na</i> frigate, and to receive an equal
number of her seamen, who should afterwards be re-exchanged at sea,
her captain being directed to accompany the fleet to a certain
distance.'</p>
<p>Here is a list of the expedition&mdash;according to one of its
officers&mdash;as it sailed from Spithead:&mdash;</p>
<p>The <i>Sirius</i>, and the <i>Supply</i>, King's ships (already
described), and the following transports:&mdash;<i>Alexander</i>,
452 tons, 30 seamen, 35 marines, 194 convicts; <i>Lady Penrhyn</i>,
333 tons, 30 seamen, 3 officers of marines, 101 females;
<i>Charlotte</i>, 335 tons, 30 seamen, 42 marines, 86 male and 20
female convicts; <i>Scarborough</i>, 430 tons, 30 seamen, 44
marines, 205 male convicts; <i>Friendship</i>, 274 tons, 25 seamen,
46 marines, 76 male and 21 female convicts; <i>Prince of Wales</i>,
350 tons, &mdash;seamen, 29 marines, 2 male and 47 female convicts;
<i>Fishburn</i>, victualler and agent's ship, 378 tons, 22 men;
<i>Golden Grove</i>, victualler and agent's ship, 335 tons, 22 men;
and the <i>Borrowdale</i>, victualler and agent's ship, 275 tons,
22 men.</p>
<p>In a last letter, dated from the <i>Sirius</i>, on the
Motherbank, 11th May 1787, and addressed to the Under-Secretary for
the Home Department, Phillip says good-bye in words which show that
he had a good heart for the future:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Once more I take my leave of you, fully sensible of the trouble
you have had in this business, for which at present I can only
thank you; but at a future period, when this country feels the
advantages that are to be drawn from our intended settlement, you
will enjoy a satisfaction that will, I am sure, make you ample
amends.'</p>
<p>On the 12th of May the fleet passed the Needles and began its
long voyage.</p>

<p class="negindent1"><small>THE VOYAGE OUT&mdash;PHILLIP'S
SUBORDINATES&mdash;ROSS THE MALCONTENT&mdash;PHILLIP'S RECEPTION AT
RIO&mdash;ARRIVAL AT THE CAPE&mdash;LETTERS FROM COLLINS AND YOUNG
SOUTHWELL&mdash;CONTRAST BETWEEN THE VOYAGES OF THE FIRST AND
SECOND FLEET.</small></p>
<p>T<small>HE</small> saloon passenger on a sixteen-knot Orient or
P. and O. liner, during the six weeks of <i>ennui</i> enforced by a
passage from London to Sydney, can sometimes, if he tries very
hard, find something to growl about; the bedroom steward may bring
his morning coffee a moment or two late, and so forth; but such
trifles are not great hardships compared with those which attended
the method of carrying emigrants followed in the 'favourite
clippers' that brought out the bulk of Australian settlers before
trade unionism and 'one-man-one-vote' politics put a stop to
emigration. Everyone has read stories of how emigrants were
accommodated. The foul-smelling, unpainted, deal-boarded part of
the ship's hold where passengers were stowed, bred a just
discontent among the half-starved exiles, and the captain of an
emigrant ship was kept pretty well occupied in allaying the
irritation of his passengers, who were generally of a class not to
bear their woes silently.</p>
<p>Between a convict transport and an emigrant ship, the difference
in accommodation was little enough&mdash;notwithstanding the
nonsense that has been written about the horrors of all Australian
convict transports. The true reason of the dreadfulness of some of
these voyages lay in the fact that the 'tween decks of a convict
transport generally carried, necessarily crowded together, for a
long spell of idleness, a hundred or more of the worst class of
criminals, often as physically diseased as they were unhealthily
minded.</p>
<p>Upon Phillip lay the task of conducting, in a fleet of
transports on a six months' voyage to a country practically
unknown, about a thousand passengers, of whom more than seven
hundred were probably in every respect the worst that could have
been selected in the gaols of England. Many of them were desperate
wretches whose presence on board the ships was a more constant and
greater menace to their safety than all the dangers known and
unknown of the sea. The conduct of this voyage is, therefore, no
unimportant test of the senior officer's fitness to command, and it
naturally forms a chapter in his life.</p>
<p>Phillip had under him intelligent and loyal sub-ordinates, and
from nearly all of them he received valuable aid from the
beginning. But here again all was not plain sailing. Major Ross,
the commandant of marines and Lieutenant-Governor, stands out as
the one malcontent on the Governor's staff, and from the time of
his appointment until his return to England, Ross generally
hampered and never assisted Phillip. Hunter, the captain of the
<i>Sirius</i>, King, the second lieutenant, Collins, lieutenant of
marines, doing duty as Judge Advocate, are the three men whose
names will be longest remembered in the history of the expedition.
The two first afterwards became in turn Governors of New South
Wales, while Collins subsequently served as Lieutenant-Governor of
Van Diemen's Land. Hunter and Collins both published accounts of
the settlement, and these works, with others by their brother
officers,&mdash;Tench (of the marines), and White (the principal
surgeon),&mdash;and the journals of King are to-day the storehouses
from which Australian historians draw most of their materials.
Phillip, during his command, was on good terms with all these
men&mdash;but King was his especial friend.</p>
<p>The fleet arrived at Santa Cruz, Teneriffe, on the 3d of June
1787. Since its sailing on 13th May, the surgeon's report showed
that 8 persons had died, 81 were on the sick list, and 1015 were
the total number on the victualling list of the fleet.</p>
<p>The voyage so far had been without notable incident. Some of the
prisoners on the <i>Scarborough</i> formed a plot to take the ship.
Two of the ringleaders were taken on board the flagship and given
each two dozen lashes by the boatswain's mate, and were then placed
on board another transport.</p>
<p>This punishment of two dozen lashes is worth the reader's
attention, as we shall, later on, refer to a charge made by one of
the historians of the First Fleet that Phillip's punishments were
'not frequent, but prompt and terrible.' Says Collins, referring to
the cause of this mutiny: 'Captain Phillip had very humanely, a few
days previous to this scheme, directed that the irons with which
most of the male convicts had hitherto been confined should be
taken off them generally, that they might have it more in their
power to strip their clothes off at night when they went to rest,
be also more at their ease during the day, and have the further
advantage of being able to wash and keep themselves clean. This
indulgence had left it more in the power of those who might be so
disposed to exert their ingenuity in so daring an attempt.'</p>
<p>Before the fleet sailed, Major Ross had taken care that his
men's comfort should not be entirely overlooked. The Government had
omitted to supply wine or spirit rations for use after arrival in
the colony to the detachment. Phillip interested himself in the
matter, and worried the authorities into complying with its urgent
request for a 'moderate distribution of the above-ment'd article.'
The Major did not similarly report the lack of a much more
important part of the equipment of the force; for Phillip, writing
to Lord Sydney from Teneriffe, complains that the marines have next
to no ammunition! Yet he does not blame Ross, who was really
responsible. 'I understood,' he wrote, 'that they would be
furnished with ammunition, but, since we sailed, find that they
were only supplied with what was necessary for immediate service
while in port; and we have neither musquet balls nor paper for
musquet cartridges; nor have we any armourer's tools.' He begs his
lordship to send out supplies of ammunition by the first ship, and
also some women's clothing which was left behind and for want of
which 'we shall be much distressed'. In another letter from the
same place he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'In general the convicts have behaved well. I saw them all
yesterday for the first time' (since leaving England). 'They are
quiet and contented, tho' there are amongst them some compleat
villains.'</p>
<p>And no musket balls! Some months to be passed yet at sea, the
new country peopled by strange blacks; the new colonists, for the
greater part, more to be guarded against than these savages, and
the garrison of 200 marines without cartridges! Well was it for the
safety of the expedition that the convicts did not know of Ross's
carelessness.</p>
<p>One incident happened at Santa Cruz, tragical enough, of the
kind some of us remember at the old Surrey Theatre. A convict
escaped and got into a boat lying astern of one of the transports.
His flight was soon discovered; and then began a man hunt which
lasted a whole day. By-and-by the fugitive was found lying at the
foot of a rock on the west shore of the bay. From the ship's side
he had been seen trying to climb the steep rocks, and at every
attempt falling back exhausted, bruised and bleeding.</p>
<p>A boat, with armed searchers, rowed towards the spot. The
convict made desperate attempts to get out of his pursuers' reach,
and the people on the ships watched the scene as from the 'front of
the house'&mdash;a gallery audience. The poor wretch was taken at
the muzzle of a levelled musket. A flogging and heavy leg irons was
all he got out of his dash for liberty.</p>
<p>Here is a story of another kind. The seamen of one of the
transports clubbed together and handed their metal spoons to a
'coiner' among the prisoners. The fellow turned the spoons into
good imitations of the silver dollars of the Brazils, and the
sailors tried to pass the counterfeit money. At the first attempt
the fraud was detected, and the sailors, to save themselves,
confessed. Their grog was stopped, and the coiner was flogged.</p>
<p>The fleet stayed a week at Teneriffe exchanging courtesies with
the Governor of the island, and receiving on board fresh provisions
and water. On the 5th of August the ships reached Rio de Janeiro,
where Phillip took in a great quantity of stores, including 10,000
musket balls.</p>
<p>From Rio he wrote several letters to Lord Sydney and Nepean, and
in them gave a detailed account of his progress thus far. The
English captain's former service under the Portuguese Government
obtained for him from the Viceroy many civilities, and the generous
reception of the fleet at the Brazils was very different to its
treatment at the hands of the Dutch Governor at the Cape of Good
Hope, the next port of call.</p>
<p>During the stay of the ships at Rio, Phillip caused an
observatory to be established on shore, and a party of navigating
officers were landed to make observations, test the rate of the
timepieces and so forth, while the ships were cleaned inside with
disinfectants, and the convicts minutely inspected. Fresh meat,
vegetables and oranges were freely given to them as precautions
against scurvy, and Phillip himself went among them, threatening
severe punishment to the unruly, and speaking a few words of
encouragement to those who evinced any signs of a disposition to
redeem their characters.</p>
<p>Just before the <i>Sirius</i> sailed, a Portuguese soldier
stowed away. The man was discovered and brought before Phillip. He
said that having been absent from his duty some time he feared to
return, and begged to be received on board and carried to New
Holland. 'Put him in one of our boats and take him ashore', was
Phillip's curt order.</p>
<p>The man, as the sailors led him towards the gangway, turned pale
and trembled at the prospective punishment.</p>
<p>'And,' added Phillip, 'land him at some spot where he can get
back to barracks without his absence being discovered.'</p>
<p>A similar instance occurred at the Cape, when a Dutch soldier
tried to get a passage on one of the transports, and Phillip
returned him to his regiment, first obtaining a promise of pardon
from the authorities.</p>
<p>Soon after the vessels cleared Rio, they met with their first
bad weather, and the five weeks and four days which they occupied
in reaching the Cape were on this account very trying to the
closely confined prisoners. But the care taken to observe
cleanliness, and the stock of wholesome food procured from Rio,
preserved them in good health, and the sick list was a small
one.</p>
<p>A letter to Nepean from Phillip, written while at Rio, and dated
2d September 1787, shows that he kept his eyes open to other
matters besides the one he had in hand:&mdash;</p>
<p>'This is my last letter, as I hope to sail to-morrow. You know
how much I was interested in the intended expedition against Monte
Vedio, and that it was said that the Spaniards had more troops than
I supposed. The following account I have from a person who was
there (through) all the war, and I am certain that the account is
exact: One Regiment under 700; Four Companys of Artillery, 400;
Dragoons, 400; Two Battalions of Infantry, 700. These were divided
on the north and south shores, and in different towns. Monte Vedio
would not have been defended, as half these troops could not have
been drawn together. Of this you will be so good as to inform the
Lords Sydney and Landsdown; it will corroborate what I mentioned
before I left town. The 21st being the Prince of Portugal's
birthday, and the Vice-King receiving the compliments of all the
officers, I waited on him with those I had presented to him on our
arrival. The <i>Sirius</i> fired 21 guns, having the flag of
Portugal hoisted at the fore-topmast-head, and the Union at the
mizen. He seemed much pleased with this compliment, and we part
perfectly satisfied with each other.'</p>
<p>One of Phillip's despatches from Rio contains these
words:&mdash;</p>
<p>'One hundred and fifteen pipes of rum has been purchased for the
use of the garrison, when landed, and for the use of the detachment
at this port.'</p>
<p>This purchase was to be the cause of much trouble in the future.
To this day some of the oldest inhabitants of the colony will tell
you that they can recall the time when an acre of land could be
bought for a bottle of rum. Such transactions were common enough
early in the century, and one of the principal and oldest buildings
in Sydney is still remembered as portion of the old Rum Hospital, a
title it earned as a store in the days of the Rum currency.</p>
<p>The fleet arrived at the Cape on the 13th of October 1787, and
sailed from Table Bay on the 12th of the following month. During
the time, in spite of a very cool reception from the Dutch
Governor, Phillip secured plenty of fresh provisions and a great
quantity of plants, seeds and live stock, but on account of the
heavy charges and the want of room to stow them, the amount
purchased was very much less than it should have been. What
Australians now rightly speak of as 'our great pastoral industry'
was started with fewer than fifty sheep, half a dozen cows, a
couple of bulls, six horses, and some pigs and goats. It is perhaps
superfluous to state that many Australian sheep-breeders of to-day
could not off-hand tell you within a thousand or two how many sheep
they own.</p>
<p>The enthusiastic projectors of the new colony had great faith in
its future as a rival to the Spice Islands, and Phillip, obedient
to instructions, did not forget to take on board at Rio all sorts
of seeds and plants with this end in view, but the selection turned
out unsuitable to the new country, and what was embarked at the
Cape proved to be much more useful, probably because Phillip was
aided in his choice by a botanist&mdash;Mason&mdash;who was
residing there.</p>
<p>The fleet left Table Bay, as already stated, on the 12th of
November, and on the 25th of the same month Phillip decided to go
on board the <i>Supply</i>, which sailed better than the
<i>Sirius</i>, with the view of reaching Botany Bay first and
making some preparations for the landing of the colonists. The
<i>Alexander</i>, <i>Scarborough</i> and <i>Friendship</i>
accompanied the <i>Supply</i>, and the fleet, thus divided into two
squadrons, continued the voyage without noteworthy incident until
their arrival within a couple of days of each other at Botany
Bay.</p>
<p>'Thus,' writes Collins, the Judge-Advocate, 'under the blessing
of God was happily completed in eight months and one week, a voyage
which before it was undertaken the mind hardly dared venture to
contemplate, and on which it was impossible to reflect without some
apprehensions as to its termination. . . . We had sailed five
thousand and twenty-one leagues . . .without meeting any accident,
in a fleet of eleven sail, nine of which were merchantmen that had
never before sailed in that distant and imperfectly explored ocean.
. . . Only thirty-two persons had died since leaving England, among
whom were to be included one or two deaths by accident; although
previous to our departure it was generally conjectured that before
we should have been a month at sea one of the transports would have
been converted into a hospital ship. But it fortunately happened
otherwise. The high health which was apparent in every countenance'
(when Botany Bay was reached) 'was to be attributed not only to the
refreshments we met with at Rio de Janeiro and the Cape of Good
Hope, but to the excellent quality of the provisions with which we
were supplied by Mr Richards, junior, the contractor; and the
spirits visible in every eye was to be ascribed to the general joy
and satisfaction which immediately took place on finding ourselves
arrived at that port which had been so much and so long the subject
of our most serious reflections, the constant theme of our
conversations.'</p>
<p>In similar language Tench and White describe the satisfactory
termination of the voyage.</p>
<p>If there are now living any descendants of 'Mr Richards, junior,
the contractor', let them treasure this certificate to the honesty
of their ancestor, for his was a virtue rare among the contractors
of his day.</p>
<p>A youngster named Southwell, a master's mate on the
<i>Sirius</i>, from whose letters much of interest can be
extracted, has a word of praise for Phillip's care of the people in
his charge. He says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The Commodore's conduct has endeared him to most of them, and,
indeed, I believe few could have been found better calculated for
the occasion than our commander. He is a man who has seen much of
the Service and much of the world, and has studied it. He is
possessed of great good sense, well informed, indefatigable upon
service, is humane and at the same time spirited and resolute; for
of his courage, fame allows him to have given honorable proofs on
former occasions.'</p>
<p>And again:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The Governor is certainly one of a thousand, and is very
considerate in everything, and extraordinary clever in every
contrivance and method to render the ships healthy and airy.'</p>
<p>This same Southwell afterwards quarrelled with Phillip, and what
he has to say against the Governor will be duly recorded; meanwhile
let Phillip have the full benefit of his favourable
testimony:&mdash;</p>
<p>'I have to add that on coming on board, after so long a
cessation from duty, I thought it would look better not to sue for
any indulgence in that respect, and, indeed, was so much mended
that there was no very great merit to me on that acc't.
Accordingly, I kept the deck, and acted in my station, but for very
few hours, for we had hardly got the anchors up before the Governor
told me by no means to keep watch or to expose myself to the
weather till I found myself fully recovered in health and strength,
for he cou'd perceive I was much reduced and very different from
when he saw me in town. This was very kind and considerate, and I
made my best acknowledgements; and as I really thought a few
nights' recess would ensure the matter and compleate my health, I
told him I would make use of the indulgence for a few nights, but
he most obligingly told me to lay by both day and night till I felt
myself perfectly well, and that I need only come on deck when I
thought I might derive advantage from air and exercise. He
frequently asks me how I do, and has desired me to want for nothing
that he has on board, and to send to his steward for it without
ceremony, for that anything he has is quite at my service, and he
shou'd be happy it would do me good. I am the more particular on
this head, as I know it will be of a pleasing savour to your
affectionate solicitude for my welfare&mdash;indeed, he is very
kind to all, and we are very happy in our worthy commander.'</p>
<p>That the modern voyager may the better understand why Collins
rejoices at the successful conduct of this sea journey, here is an
extract from a letter from Port Jackson on the voyage of the Second
Fleet of transports:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Oh! if you had but seen the shocking sight of the poor
creatures that came out in the three ships it would make your heart
bleed. They were almost dead. Very few could stand, and they were
obliged to sling them like goods and hoist them out of the ships,
they were so feeble, and they died ten or twelve a day when first
landed. There died in three ships alone on the way out 347 men and
women. They were not so long as we' (the First Fleet) 'were coming
here, but they were confined, and had bad victuals and stinking
water. Governor Phillip was very angry, and scolded the captains a
great deal, and, I heard, intended to write to London about it, for
I heard him say it was murdering them.'</p>
<p>Eleven sail of ships in the First Fleet, 700 convicts, many of
whom embarked ill, but only 32 deaths. What a terrible contrast was
afforded by the Second Fleet!</p>

<p>F<small>OR</small> Phillip the sea-captain, the anxieties of a
long voyage under unusual and trying circumstances were ended, and
his weather-beaten ships safely anchored; for Phillip the Governor
(not in its present quasi-ornamental interpretation, but what is
signified by the word's real meaning), the work was now to begin.
'The commander over men; he to whose will our wills are to be
subordinate and loyally surrender themselves, and find their
welfare in doing so, may be reckoned the most important of Great
Men.'</p>
<p>If Phillip, in his small way, so governed that his subjects
<i>did</i> loyally surrender themselves, and found their welfare in
so doing, then he may take rank with the 'most important of Great
Men.' But as yet he had other things to consider than methods of
governing&mdash;chief among them the site of the
settlement&mdash;for Botany Bay, he found, would not do. The very
appearance of the country must have been disheartening, for Botany
Bay is about as unlovely a spot as can be imagined; and indeed the
whole coast line of New South Wales, even at that season of the
year&mdash;the middle of summer&mdash;presented a monotonously
repellent and forbidding aspect to people whose eyes were used to
the soft beauties of the scenery of their native land.</p>
<p>Phillip went expeditiously to work. There was no shifting of
responsibilities upon the authorities; no waiting for instructions
from the Home Office. He had to decide at once, at the very
beginning of the business, where, after his eight months' voyage,
he should land his thousand subjects. And no doubt he congratulated
himself that he had taken care before he left England to have
liberty to change the intended site of the settlement.</p>
<p>His first despatch, dated Sydney Cove, 15th May 1788, tells Lord
Sydney his reasons for making the change. Almost as soon as the
<i>Supply</i> had anchored, he began to examine Botany Bay, which,
though an extensive expanse of water, afforded no shelter from
easterly winds&mdash;the 'disaster' wind of the eastern Australian
seaboard. Then, too, the water was shallow, for the most part,
except near the entrance, and his seaman's eye was quick to note
that ships would be exposed to a heavy sea when easterly weather
set in. Creeks of fresh water were plentiful (until quite recently
the greater part of the water supply of Sydney was derived from the
Botany Bay swamps), but the lowlands were spongy and swampy, and
Phillip did not see 'any situation to which there was not some very
strong objection', though there were spots whereon a small number
of people might have been settled. Yet even the most eligible
situation, he considered, would be unhealthy by reason of the
swamps, and he decided to examine Port Jackson, fifteen miles to
the northward. But so that no time should be lost, in case his
search for a better harbour and site for a settlement should prove
fruitless, he at once gave orders for a certain area of ground
'near Point Sutherland, to be cleared, and preparations made for
landing under the direction of the Lieutenant-Governor.'</p>
<p>The story of his discovery of the site of the future settlement
may well be left to himself:&mdash;'I went round' (from Botany Bay)
'with three boats, taking with me Captain Hunter and several
officers, that by examining different parts of the port at the same
time less time might be lost. We got into Port Jackson early in the
afternoon, and had the satisfaction of finding the finest harbour
in the world, in which a thousand sail of the line may ride in the
most perfect security, and of which a rough survey, made by Captain
Hunter and the officers of the <i>Sirius</i> after the ships came
round, may give your Lordship some idea. The different coves were
examined with all possible expedition. I fixed on the one that had
the best spring of water, and in which the ships can anchor so
close to the shore that at a very small expence quays may be made
at which the largest ships may unload. This cove, which I honoured
with the name of Sydney, is about a quarter of a mile across at the
entrance, and half a mile in length.'</p>
<p>Three days later he returned to Botany Bay, and immediately made
preparations to leave. Ordering Hunter to follow him with the
transports, he sailed in the <i>Supply</i> for Port Jackson on 25th
January&mdash;seven days after he had first anchored in Botany
Bay&mdash;and on the following evening all the transports were
safely moored in Sydney Cove.</p>
<p>Whilst the ships were lying at Botany Bay, the <i>Boussole</i>
and the <i>Astrolabe</i>, two French exploring ships commanded by
the ill-fated La P&eacute;rouse, appeared and dropped anchor.
Learning that La P&eacute;rouse was anxious to send letters to
Europe by the returning transports, Phillip sent an officer over to
him to receive the despatches. This meeting with La P&eacute;rouse
was the last occasion on which the Frenchmen were seen, and the
despatches sent by the French Admiral through the English exiles
contained the last news the French received of their exploring
expedition until forty years later, when the relics of the
unfortunate ships were discovered on the island of Vanikoro.</p>
<p>The task of clearing the ground and erecting storehouses was
begun as soon as the ships arrived in Port Jackson&mdash;'a labour
of which it will be hardly possible,' says Phillip, 'to give your
Lordship a just idea.' Then troubles came thick and fast; yet he
does not dilate upon the worry and incessant strain he must have
undergone from the day he landed his people to the date of his
letter to Lord Sydney, a period of sixteen weeks. Here is a long
extract:&mdash;'The people were healthy when landed, but the scurvy
has, for some time, appeared amongst them, and now rages in a most
extraordinary manner. Only sixteen carpenters could be hired from
the ships, and several of the convict carpenters were sick. It was
now the middle of February; the rains began to fall very heavy, and
pointed out the necessity of hutting the people; convicts were
therefore appointed to assist the detachment in this work.</p>
<p>'February the 14th the <i>Supply</i> sailed for Norfolk Island,
with Philip Gidley King, second lieutenant of His Majesty's ship
<i>Sirius</i>, for the purpose of settling that island. He only
carried with him a petty officer surgeon's mate, two marines, two
men who understood the cultivation of flax, with nine men and six
women convicts. . . . I beg leave to recommend him as an officer of
merit, and whose perseverance in that or any other service may be
depended upon. . . .</p>
<p>'Your Lordship will not be surprized that I have been under the
necessity of assembling a Criminal Court. Six men were condemned to
death. One, who was the head of the gang, was executed the same
day; the others I reprieved. They are to be exiled from the
settlement, and when the season permits I intend they shall be
landed near the South Cape, where, by their forming connexions with
the natives, some benefit may accrue to the public. These men had
frequently robbed the stores and the other convicts. The one who
suffered and two others were condemned for robbing the stores of
provisions the very day they received a week's provisions, and at
which time their allowance . . . was the same as the soldiers,
spirits excepted; the others for robbing a tent, and for stealing
provisions from other convicts.</p>
<p>'The great labour in clearing the ground will not permit more
than eight acres to be sown this year with wheat and barley. At the
same time the immense number of ants and field-mice will render our
crops very uncertain. Part of the live stock brought from the Cape,
small as it was, has been lost, and our resource in fish is also
uncertain. Some days great quantities are caught, but never
sufficient to save any part of the provisions; and at times fish
are scarce.'</p>
<p>'The very small proportion of females makes the sending out an
additional number absolutely necessary, for I am certain your
Lordship will think that to send for women from the Islands, in our
present situation, would answer no other purpose than that of
bringing them to pine away in misery.</p>
<p>'Your Lordship will, I hope, excuse the confused manner in which
I have in this letter given an account of what has past since I
left the Cape of Good Hope. It has been written at different times,
and my situation at present does not permit me to begin so long a
letter again, the canvas house I am under being neither wind nor
water proof.'</p>
<p>In reading these extracts, it should be remembered that all
previous knowledge of Port Jackson is summed up in these words from
Cook's <i>Voyages</i>: 'At this time (noon, 6th May 1770) we were
between two and three miles distant from the land and abreast of a
bay or harbour in which there appeared to be a good anchorage, and
which I called Port Jackson.'</p>
<p>Phillip was not the man to waste words in his despatches, and so
he says nothing of the interesting ceremony at the inauguration of
the settlement. On this subject latter-day historians have not been
so reticent, and one writer in a book published thirty-five years
ago put an up-to-date speech into the mouth of the Governor, in
which, among other things equally remarkable, he is made to
discourse of the country's 'fertile plains, tempting only the
slightest labours of the husbandman to produce in abundance the
fairest and richest fruits; its interminable pastures, the future
home of flocks and herds innumerable; its mineral wealth, already
known to be so great as to promise that it may yet rival those
treasures which fiction loves to describe. Enough for any nation, I
say, would it be to enjoy those honours and those advantages, but
others, not less advantageous, but perhaps more honourable, await
the people of the state of which we are the founders.'</p>
<p>Collins, Tench, White, and the author of the semi-official
publication, <i>Phillip's Voyage</i>, all supply full accounts of
the ceremony, and young Southwell gives in one of his letters what
appears to be a <i>verbatim</i> report of Phillip's
speech:&mdash;</p>
<p>'On the 26th of January' (still observed as a public holiday in
the colony), 'the day after the arrival of the ships from Botany
Bay, the Union Jack was hoisted at the head of Sydney Cove, the
marines saluted and fired three volleys, and the Governor, the
centre of a little group of officers, proposed the toasts of "The
King and the royal family," and "Success to the new colony."'</p>
<p>On the 7th February, everyone belonging to the settlement having
been landed from the ships, the colonists to the number of 1030
were all assembled, the convicts seated in a half circle, the
marines paraded in front of them, and the officers in a group in
the centre. Then Collins, the Judge-Advocate, read the Governor's
commission, the other officers' commissions, the Act establishing
the colony and the rest of the formal documents, the marines fired
three volleys, and silence was commanded.</p>
<p>Phillip stepped forward, and in a hearty, simple manner thanked
the marines for their good conduct, and then turning towards the
convicts, according to Southwell, he thus addressed
them:&mdash;</p>
<p>'You have now been particularly informed of the nature of the
laws by which you are to be governed, and also of the power with
which I am invested to put them into full execution. There are
amongst you, I am willing to believe, some who are not perfectly
abandoned, and who, I hope and trust, will make the intended use of
the great indulgence and lenity their humane country has offered;
but at the same time there are many, I am sorry to add, by far the
greater part, who are innate villains and people of the most
abandoned principles. To punish these shall be my constant care,
and in this duty I ever will be indefatigable, however distressing
it may be to my feelings. Not to do so would be a piece of the most
cruel injustice to those who, as being the most worthy, I have
first named; for should I continue to pass by your enormity with an
ill-judged and ill-bestowed lenity, the consequence would be, to
preserve the peace and safety of the settlement, some of the more
deserving of you must suffer with the rest, who might otherways
have shown themselves orderly and useful members of our community.
Therefore you have my sacred word of honour that whenever you
commit a fault you shall be punished, and most severely. Lenity has
been tried; to give it further trial would be vain. I am no
stranger to the use you make of every indulgence. I speak of what
comes under my particular observation; and again I add that a
vigorous exercise of the law (whatever it may cost my feelings)
shall follow closely upon the heels of every offender.'</p>
<p>After some other words tending to this effect, they had liberty
to disperse, and the Governor then passed up and down through the
ranks of the marines upon parade, and having been saluted by them
with due honours, went, together with the principal officers, to
partake of a cold repast that had been previously prepared in a
marquee. During the whole ceremony, at intervals, the band played,
and 'God Save the King' was performed after the commissions were
read.</p>
<p>According to <i>Phillip's Voyage</i>, the Governor concluded his
speech by particularly noticing 'the illegal intercourse between
the sexes as an offence which encouraged a general profligacy of
manners and was in several ways injurious to society.' To prevent
this, he strongly recommended marriage, and promised 'every kind of
countenance and assistance to those who by entering * into that
state should manifest their willingness to conform to the laws of
morality and religion.' He formally declared 'his earnest desire to
promote the happiness of all who were under his government, and to
render the settlement in New South Wales advantageous and
honourable to his country.'</p>
<p class="foot">[* Collins reports that before the end of the month
several couples were 'announced for marriage.']</p>
<p>It is clear that Phillip had ample reason to complain of the
conduct of the prisoners.</p>
<p>'Many of them,' says Collins, 'tried to desert to the French
ships' (the <i>Boussole</i> and <i>Astrolabe</i>) 'before they left
Botany Bay, and it was soon found that they secreted at least
one-third of their working tools, and that any sort of labour was
with difficulty procured from them. The want of proper overseers
principally contributed to this. . . . Petty thefts among
themselves began soon to be complained of. The sailors from the
transports brought spirits on shore at night, though often punished
for so doing, and drunkenness was the consequence.'</p>
<p>The first despatch of the Governor has already given some idea
of the progress of the settlers for the first few weeks after they
landed. Before that letter left for England in one of the returning
transports, it was becoming apparent to Phillip that the colony
would not be self-supporting for a long while to come.</p>
<p>Phillip kept a regular journal, sending a copy of it, brought up
to date, by each transport as the ship left for England by way of
China. In July he despatched a very long letter to Lord Sydney, and
these extracts from it will be of interest:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Thus situated, your Lordship will excuse my observing a second
time that a regular supply of provisions from England will be
absolutely necessary for four or five years, as the crops for two
years to come cannot be depended on for more than what will be
necessary for seed. . . . I should hope that few convicts will be
sent out this year or the next, unless they are artificers, and . .
. I make no doubt but proper people will be sent to superintend
them. The ships that bring out convicts should have at least the
two years' provisions on board to land with them, for the putting
the convicts on board some ships and the provisions that were to
support them in others, as was done . . . much against my
inclination, must have been fatal if the ship carrying the
provisions had been lost.</p>
<p>'I have the honour to enclose your Lordship the intended plan
for the town.** The Lieutenant-Governor has already begun a small
house, which forms one corner of the parade, and I am building a
small cottage on the east side of the cove, where I shall remain
for the present with part of the convicts and an officer's guard.
The convicts on both sides are distributed in huts, which are built
only for immediate shelter. On the point of land which forms the
west side of the cove an Observatory is building, under the
direction of Lieutenant Dawes, who is charged by the Board of
Longitude with observing the expected comet. The temporary
buildings are marked in black; those intended to remain, in red. We
now make very good bricks, and the stone is good, but do not find
either limestone or chalk. . . . The principal streets are placed
so as to admit a free circulation of air, and are two hundred feet
wide. . . .' Then follows a detailed account of the progress made
so far in building operations generally.</p>
<p class="foot">[** This plan was altered by Phillip's successors,
and in consequence, instead of being wide open thoroughfares, the
streets of Sydney are as narrow as those of London.]</p>

<br>
<p>'Of the convicts,' he writes, '36 men and 4 women died on the
passage, 20 men and 8 women since landing&mdash;11 men and 1 woman
absconded; 4 have been executed, and 3 killed by the natives. The
number of convicts now employed in erecting the necessary buildings
and cultivating the lands only amounts to 320&mdash;and the whole
number of people victualled amounts to 966&mdash;consequently we
have only the labour of a part to provide for the whole. . . .</p>
<p>'I could have wished to have given your Lordship a more pleasing
account of our present situation; and am persuaded I shall have
that satisfaction hereafter; nor do I doubt but that this country
will prove the most valuable acquisition Great Britain ever made;
at the same time no country offers less assistance to the first
settlers than this does; nor do I think any country could be more
disadvantageously placed with respect to support from the mother
country, on which for a few years we must entirely depend.'</p>
<p>From a private letter of the same date to Under-Secretary
Nepean, we may extract the following passages:&mdash;</p>
<p>'I am very sorry to say that not only a great part of the
cloathing, particularly the women's, is very bad, but most of the
axes, spades, and shovels the worst that ever were seen. The
provision is as good. Of the seeds and corn sent from England, part
has been destroyed by the weevil; the rest in very good order. . .
.</p>
<p>'If fifty farmers were sent out with their families, they would
do more in one year in rendering this colony independent of the
mother country, as to provisions, than a thousand convicts. There
is some clear land, which is intended to be cultivated, at some
distance from the camp, and I intended to send out convicts for
that purpose, under the direction of a person that was going to
India in the <i>Charlotte</i> transport, but who remained to settle
in this country, and has been brought up a farmer, but several of
the convicts (three) having been lately killed by the natives, I am
obliged to defer it untill a detachment can be made.'</p>
<p>Here is another complication, and a description of the
climate:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The masters of the transports having left with the agents the
bonds and whatever papers they received that related to the
convicts, I have no account of the time for which the convicts are
sentenced, or the dates of their convictions. Some of them, by
their own account, have little more than a year to remain, and, I
am told, will apply for permission to return to England, or to go
to India, in such ships as may be willing to receive them. If lands
are granted them, Government will be obliged to support them for
two years; and it is more than probable that one-half of them,
after that time is expired, will still want support. Until I
receive instructions on this head, of course none will be permitted
to leave the settlement; but if, when the time for which they are
sentenced expires, the most abandoned and useless were permitted to
go to China, in any ships that may stop here, it would be a great
advantage to the settlement.</p>
<p>'The weather is now unsettled, and heavy rains fall frequently;
but the climate is certainly a very fine one, but the nights are
very cold, and I frequently find a difference of thirty-three
degrees in my chamber between 8 o'clock in the morning and 2
o'clock in the afternoon, though the sun does not reach the
thermometer, which is at the west end of my canvas house.'</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all his troubles, the Governor still kept a good
heart, for he ends with a cheery declaration that neither patience
nor perseverance, in the laborious task before him, will be wanting
on his part. It will be seen in what follows how well this promise
was fulfilled.</p>

<p class="negindent1"><small>PHILLIP AND THE BLACKS&mdash;HIS
DESCRIPTION OF THEIR APPEARANCE, MANNERS, CUSTOMS AND MODE OF LIFE
GENERALLY&mdash;ARABANOO&mdash;BENNILONG&mdash;PHILLIP
WOUNDED&mdash;BENNILONG'S VISIT TO ENGLAND&mdash;A SAVAGE ORDER OF
REPRISAL.</small></p>
<p>I<small>N</small> a paragraph of Phillip's 'Instructions', he
was enjoined to use every possible means 'to open an intercourse
with the natives, and to conciliate their affections.' If any of
them were ill-treated or wantonly destroyed by the whites, he was
to bring the offenders to punishment; and was to report his opinion
to one of the Secretaries for State as to the way in which
intercourse with these people could be turned to the advantage of
the colony.</p>
<p>The manner and spirit in which he carried out this part of his
duties supplies us with an interesting if not altogether agreeable
chapter in the narrative of the Governor's administration. Light
and pleasant reading is none too common, naturally enough, in the
annals of the penal settlement.</p>
<p>Phillip very often turned from the disheartening duty of trying
to civilise his prisoners to the more promising task of tutoring
the native savages, either as a relaxation, or because he really
believed that the blacks could be taught to work, and so add to the
wealth of his poor territory; for either or both of these reasons,
there was nothing in which the first Governor of Australia took a
greater, or more intelligent interest.</p>
<p>A great number of people, many of whom have never met him or who
have only made his acquaintance through the medium of a bottle of
rum, have asserted that the Australian aboriginal belongs to the
lowest type of humanity, and his warmest admirers will admit that
he is a long way below the American Indian, the African negro, or
the Polynesian.</p>
<p>But even in recent times the Australian blacks, as the rank and
file in exploring expeditions, as trackers in the police force, or
as ordinary day-labourers on cattle and sheep stations, have earned
from their masters the best of characters. However, in this book we
have no concern with the present day blacks&mdash;the civilising
process has well nigh got rid of them, and the majority of the few
that remain, have either become good Christians, regularly under
the missionary influence, or are cheerfully drinking themselves to
death.</p>
<p>Phillip's first meeting with the natives was at Botany Bay, and
he wrote of them as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>'With respect to the natives, it was my determination from my
first landing that nothing less than the most absolute necessity
should ever make me fire upon them.'</p>
<p>La P&eacute;rouse had been obliged to fire on them at Botany
Bay; and this, coupled with the bad behaviour of some of the
transport seamen and convicts, caused the natives to avoid the
settlers at Port Jackson for a time. Phillip himself, while at
Botany Bay, had very quickly made friends with them by going among
them alone and unarmed, and no disputes occurred with them during
his stay there. They were all naked, but quickly ornamented
themselves with the beads and pieces of red baize given to them.
When Phillip's boat party entered Port Jackson, many armed blacks
met them upon landing, and were 'very vociferous'. One of them, who
appeared to be the master of the family, was induced by the
Governor to accompany him to where the marines were boiling some
meat, and examine what was in the pot. 'He exprest his admiration,'
says Phillip, 'in a manner that made me believe he intended to
profit from what he saw. . . . I believe they know no other way of
dressing their food but by broiling, and they are seldom seen
without a fire, or a piece of wood on fire, which they carry with
them from place to place, and in their canoes, so that I apprehend
they find some difficulty in procuring fire by any other means with
which they are acquainted.* The boats, in passing near a point of
land in the harbour, were seen by a number of men, and twenty of
them waded into the water unarmed, received what was offered them,
and examined the boats with a curiosity that gave me a much higher
opinion of them than I had formed from the behaviour of those seen
in Captain Cook's voyage, and their confidence and manly behaviour
made me give the name of Manly Cove to this place. The same people
afterwards joined us where we dined; they were all armed with
lances, two with shields and swords&mdash;the latter made of wood,
the gripe small, and I thought less formidable than a good stick.
As their curiosity made them very troublesome when we were
preparing our dinner, I made a circle round us. There was little
difficulty in making them understand that they were not to come
within it, and they then sat down very quiet. The white clay rubbed
on the upper part of the face of one of these men had the
appearance of a mask; and a woman that appeared on some rocks near
which the boats passed was marked with white on the face, neck and
breasts, in such a manner as to render her the most horrid figure I
ever saw. They are not often seen marked in this manner, and it is
only done on some particular occasions.'</p>
<p class="foot">[* Phillip was wrong in this conclusion. The
Australian blacks are adepts in producing fire by the friction of
two sticks.]</p>
<p>The women, he noticed, appeared to be less cheerful than the
men, and under great subjection, though at Broken Bay several of
them met Phillip's landing party, and 'one of them, a young woman,
was very talkative and remarkably cheerful. . . . The talkative
lady, when she joined us in her canoe the day after we first
landed, stood up and gave us a song that was not unpleasing. As
most of the women have lost the two first joints of the little
finger on the left hand, so most of the men want the right front
tooth in the upper jaw, and have the gristle that separates the
nostrils perforated, frequently having a piece of stick or a bone
thrust through, and which does not add to their beauty. This is
general, but I saw some very old men that had not lost the tooth,
and whose noses were not perforated for this ornament. On my
showing them that I wanted a front tooth, it occasioned a general
clamour, and I thought gave me some little merit in their
opinion.'</p>
<p>On another occasion, at Broken Bay, an old black appeared and
guided the boats to a safe landing-place, and then rendered
assistance in clearing the ground for a camping-place. His
behaviour was so friendly that Phillip gave him a hatchet and other
presents, but, when it was dark, he returned and stole a spade. The
Governor, to show his displeasure, 'gave him two or three slight
slaps on the shoulder' with his open hand. . . . 'Seizing a spear,
he came close up to me, poised it, and appeared determined to
strike. . . . This circumstance is mentioned to show that they do
not want personal courage, for several officers and men were then
near me. . . .</p>
<p>'They cannot be called a very cleanly people, yet I have seen
one of them, after having in his hand a piece of pork, hold out his
fingers for others to smell, with strong marks of disgust; and tho'
they seldom refused bread or meat if offered them, I have never
been able to make them eat with us, and when they left us they
generally threw away the bread and meat; but fish they always
accepted, and would broil and eat it.' Phillip estimated the number
of blacks living about Botany Bay, Broken Bay, Port Jackson and the
immediate coast as not less than fifteen hundred.</p>
<p>Soon after landing. Captain Hunter, with the first lieutenant of
the <i>Sirius</i>, set about making a survey of Port Jackson and
exploring the bays and arms of Sydney Harbour. Hunter often came
across the natives while at this work, and the shyness of the
blacks was beginning to wear off when the trouble with the
Frenchmen at Botany Bay and a similar incident in Sydney Cove put a
temporary stop to friendly relations.</p>
<p>The natives were accustomed to leave their
possessions&mdash;clubs, spears, fire sticks and so on&mdash;lying
on the beach, and the Europeans received a strict order never to
touch them. The whites, of course, disobeyed this order&mdash;they
wanted curios&mdash;and thus began a quarrel. The natives,
determined to have some return for their lost property, to the
number of about a score, landed on an island and seized some
European tools. The blacks were only driven into their canoes after
the two or three white men in charge of the island opened fire on
them, wounding several with small shot. The scene of this encounter
was Garden Island, so called from its being set apart as a
vegetable garden for the people of the <i>Sirius</i>. It is now the
Imperial Naval Depot in Sydney, the headquarters of the squadron on
the Australian station, and is one of the most important naval
establishments outside of Great Britain.</p>
<p>This outbreak of hostilities was followed soon afterwards by
more serious disturbances. Convicts who straggled away from the
settlement were often attacked and seriously wounded, and later on
some were killed. In all these cases there was evidence that some
provocation had, either through wantonness or ignorance of native
susceptibilities, been given.</p>
<p>Phillip, anxious to put a stop to these disorders, determined as
a first means to that end to capture a native and teach him some
English, or learn from him enough of his language to establish
communication between the two races.</p>
<p>Accordingly, a young man was seized and placed in charge of a
trustworthy convict, the two being lodged in a hut near the main
guardhouse. The black took it very coolly, and the convict reported
that he slept and ate and drank with perfect indifference.</p>
<p>Captain Hunter, whose account of what he saw and did is
invaluable for the reason that his narrative is always in the
unembellished log-book style of a plain sailor, thus tells the
story:&mdash;</p>
<p>'As soon as the ship was secured, I went on shore to wait on the
Governor, whom I found in good health. He was sitting by the fire
drinking tea with a few friends, among whom I observed a native man
of this country, who was decently cloathed, and seemed to be as
much at his ease at the tea-table as any person there; he managed
his cup and saucer as well as though he had been long accustomed to
such entertainment. This man was taken from his friends, by force,
by Lieutenant Ball, of the <i>Supply</i>, and Lieutenant George
Johnston, of the marines, who were sent down the harbour with two
boats for that purpose. . . . His name was Arabanoo, and he was
taken . . . in the following manner. After having been a short time
in conversation with some of the gentlemen, one of the seamen, who
had been previously directed, threw a rope round his neck, and
dragged him in a moment down to the boat. His cries brought a
number of his friends into the skirts of the wood, from whence they
threw many lances, but without effect. The terror this poor wretch
suffered can better be conceived than expressed. He believed he was
to be immediately murdered; but upon the officers coming into the
boat, they removed the rope from his neck to his leg, and treated
him with so much kindness that he became a little more chearful. He
was for some time after his arrival at the Governor's house
ornamented with an iron shackle about his leg, to prevent his being
able to effect his escape with ease; this he was taught to consider
as <i>bang-ally</i>, which is the name given in their language to
every decoration; as he might well believe it a compliment paid to
him, because it was no uncommon thing for him to see several (of
the most worthless of the convicts, who had merited punishment)
every day shackled like him, the cause of which he could not of
course understand. However, he was very soon reconciled to his
situation by the kind treatment he received from every person about
him, and the iron growing uneasy, it was taken off, and he was
allowed to go where he pleased. He very soon learnt the names of
the different gentlemen who took notice of him, and when I was made
acquainted with him, he learnt mine, which he never forgot, but
expressed great desire to come on board my "<i>now&egrave;e</i>",**
which is their expression for a boat or other vessel upon the
water. . . . I found him to be a very good-natured, talkative
fellow; he was about thirty years of age, and tolerably
well-looked. I expressed, when at the Governor's, much surprize at
not having seen a single native on the shore, or a canoe as we came
up in the ship, the reason of which I could not comprehend, until I
was informed that the smallpox had made its appearance a few months
ago amongst these unfortunate creatures, and that it was truly
shocking to go round the coves of this harbour, which were formerly
so much frequented by the natives, where, in the caves of the rocks
which used to shelter whole families in bad weather, were now to be
seen men, women and children lying dead.'</p>
<p class="foot">[** Compare the Latin '<i>navis</i>' and the Greek
'<i>&nu;&alpha;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</i>'.]</p>
<p>After the death of Arabanoo, who fell a victim to the smallpox,
Phillip determined to repeat his civilising experiment, and in
November 1789 two more natives were captured, Coleby and Bennilong;
the last named is entitled to some notice here, for he was the
first <i>true</i> Australian to visit England.</p>
<p>Mrs Macarthur, wife of Captain Macarthur, who introduced the
merino sheep to the colony in 1790, in a letter to friends in
England, says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Amongst the unhappy objects' (<i>i.e</i>., those suffering from
the smallpox) 'who were discovered were a boy and a girl; these
were brought in, and from the humanity of the clergyman, who took
the girl, and of the principal surgeon, Mr White, who took the boy,
they were both saved. After they began to learn English and to make
us understand them, it was imagined . . . that if a man or two
could be brought to reside with us, that some valuable information
might be obtained respecting the interior parts of the country.</p>
<p>'With this view the Governor left no means untried to effect an
intimacy with them, but every endeavour of that sort, as before,
prov'd ineffectual. . . . Despairing to gain their confidence by
fair means, the Governor ordered that two men should be taken by
force. This was done. The poor fellows . . . exhibited the
strongest marks of terror and consternation at this proceeding,
believing they were certainly meant to be sacrificed. When they
were taken to the Governor's house, and immediately clean'd and
clothed, their astonishment at everything they saw was amazing. A
new world was unfolded to their view at once. For some days they
were much dejected, but it soon gave way to cheerfulness. They were
then admitted to the Governor's table, and in a little time ate and
drank everything that was given them.</p>
<p>'The oldest of the two, Coleby, however, soon tired of his
honourable captivity, and in a very artful manner one night made
his escape. Bennilong stayed till May 1790, and then took himself
off without any known reason, having been treated with the most
uniform kindness.'</p>
<p>He had taken very kindly to the white men, and was given a hut
on the eastern point of Sydney Cove, which was known for many years
after, and is even now sometimes spoken of, as Bennilong Point.
Fort Macquarie covers the site of the hut, and Government House is
within a stone's throw of the place.</p>
<p>In one of her letters Mrs Macarthur tells of Bennilong's
reappearance, and how that event nearly led to Phillip's death. On
the 7th of September Captain Nepean and some other officers were on
their way to Broken Bay when the boats put in at Manly
Cove&mdash;now the most favourite seaside resort of the inhabitants
of Sydney. Some 200 natives were there observed feeding on the
carcase of a whale which had floated ashore. They seemed very
friendly, and Nanberry (the boy above mentioned), who was in one of
the boats, was told to inquire for Bennilong and Coleby, 'when,
behold! both gentlemen appeared, and advancing with the utmost
confidence, asked in broken English for all their old friends in
Sydney.' Nepean at once sent a messenger to Phillip, who would, he
knew, be pleased at the news.</p>
<p>Without losing time the Governor, accompanied by Mr Collins and
Lieutenant Waterhouse, at once set out and reached Manly Cove. To
show his friendly intentions, Phillip landed unarmed, and Bennilong
approached and shook hands with him. Coleby, however, had
disappeared. The Governor took care not to embarrass Bennilong by
asking the reason of his flight, and the black appeared much
pleased and thankful for some presents given him by Captain Nepean,
and asked Phillip for a hatchet. This the Governor promised to
bring him the next day. 'Then,' says Mrs Macarthur, 'Mr Collins and
Mr Waterhouse now joined them, and several natives also came
forward; they continued to converse with much seeming friendship
until they' (the white men) 'had insensibly wandered some distance
from the boat, . . . none of the gentlemen had the precaution to
take a gun. . . . This the Governor perceiving, deemed it prudent
to retreat, and after assuring Bennilong that he would remember his
promise, told him he was going. At that moment an old-looking man
advanced, whom Bennilong said was his friend, and wished the
Governor to take notice of him. At this he approached the old man
with his hand extended, when on a sudden the savage started back,
and snatched up a spear from the ground and poized it to throw. The
Governor, seeing the danger, told him in their tongue that it was
bad, and still advanced, when, with a mixture of horror and
intrepidity, the native discharged the spear with all his force at
the Governor. It entered above his collar-bone, and came out at his
back, nine inches from the entrance, taking an oblique direction.
The natives from the rocks now poured in their spears in abundance,
so that it was with the utmost difficulty and the greatest good
fortune that no other hurt was received in getting the Governor
into the boat.'</p>
<p>Phillip's personal coolness needs not this incident to prove its
existence, but Mrs Macarthur's statement of his behaviour ought to
have a place here. She says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'As soon as they returned to this place an universal solicitude
prevail'd, as the danger of the wound could by no means be
ascertained untill the spear was extracted, and this was not done
before His Excellency had caus'd some papers to be arrang'd, lest
the consequence might prove fatal, which happily it did not, for in
drawing out the spear it was found that no vital part had been
touch'd. . . . The wound perfectly heal'd in the course of a few
weeks. . . . Bennilong came many times to see the Governor during
his confinement, and expressed great sorrow; but the reason why the
mischief was done could not be learnt.'</p>
<p>This incident happened in 1790, and Mr Southwell, the young man
from whose letters we have before quoted, was at that time a very
discontented master's mate, still without promotion. Let us hope
that the change in his sentiments towards the Governor was not
brought about too much by his disappointments, for his opinions on
this adventure of Phillip's and on other matters to be quoted
savour somewhat of bitterness.</p>
<p>'I cannot sufficiently express my approbation of your good sense
in forbidding those who perused it to publish my insignificant
narrative; or my chagrin at their improper conduct who have,
notwithstanding, taken the liberty to do so. I saw it, being the
concluding part, in the <i>Hampshire Chronicle and Portsmouth and
Chichester Journal</i>, Sept'r 7, 1789. Mr Morgan, since we were at
sea, came across it, and from peculiarity of stile immediately
recognized it, as did most of our principals on board. I add that I
am vexed at it for several reasons, and pray you to take care who
you honour with a sight of my cobweb productions, if this is the
way they honour them. Apropos, that date is the anniversary of the
Governor's misfortune of the year 1790, when he was speared by a
native in Manly Bay, in a manner which savours much of imprudence
next to folly. Bennilong, as I said in my letters, had made his
escape, and this was the first interview since that incident. It,
however very near fatal, proved by no means so, as he soon
recovered, and it was followed by the fullest intercourse with
these people, insomuch that they eat, drink and sleep in the camp
with the most perfect sangfroid; and some of their dames, like too
many of ours, gladly forego that dear pleasure of nursing their own
bratts, and leave them in perfect security to the care of several
of the convict women, who are suitably rewarded by the
Governor.'</p>
<p>By degrees the natives on the shores of the harbour grew more
familiar with the whites, and in the course of two or three years,
the aboriginals in the immediate neighbourhood of Sydney ceased to
be a serious menace to the colonists, except in cases where
individuals suffered through their own misconduct.</p>
<p>Phillip had so thoroughly won the affection of Bennilong that
the black, by his own especial request, accompanied the Governor to
England, taking with him a fellow-countryman, who before Phillip
left had 'regularly joined His Excellency's household.'</p>
<p>Poor Bennilong succumbed to the benefits of civilisation. A
letter from Hunter, written just before he sailed from Plymouth on
his return to the colony in January 1795, alludes to him as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Bennilong is with me, but I think in a precarious state of
health. He has for the last twelve months been flattered with the
hope of seeing again his native country&mdash;a happiness he has
fondly looked forward to, but so long a disappointment has broken
his spirit, and the coldness of the weather here has so frequently
laid him up that I am apprehensive his lungs are
affected&mdash;that was the cause of the other's death. I do all I
can to keep him up, but still am doubtful of his living.'</p>
<p>The grave of 'the other', to whom Hunter refers, is in the
churchyard * of the village of Eltham, in Kent. Poor Hunter was put
to considerable expense over these two aboriginals, who were a
trying charge; and he did his best, though without result, to make
the Government refund him his outlay.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The stone bears the following
inscription:&mdash;'In memory of Yemmerrawanyea, a native of New
South Wales, who died the 18th May 1794, in the 19th year of his
age. Stone renewed 1882.']</p>
<p>During his stay in England, Bennilong did not apparently attract
much attention. On his return to the colony he passed the remainder
of his life drifting aimlessly about between the little township of
Sydney and the native camps in its vicinity. Phillip's immediate
successors apparently took but a languid interest in the native
question, and beyond occasional squabbles between the two races and
fragmentary stories of their customs, more or less inaccurately
reported, little worth printing is recorded.</p>
<p>Of Bennilong himself we hear again from time to time, and he is
always in disgrace, until at last the early chroniclers mention his
name no longer.</p>
<p>Phillip's policy towards the natives, save in one instance,
during his administration was to win their friendship by kindness.
Even after he was wounded, he allowed no attempt at reprisals to be
made, but, on the contrary, took a great deal of trouble to make
Bennilong understand and inform his countrymen that the Governor
regarded the outrage as arising from their fear of capture&mdash;a
fear justified by the previous abduction of some of their number.
The importance of preserving the crops from the thieving
propensities of the blacks was the only excuse permitted for firing
upon the aborigines.</p>
<p>Tench relates an incident which illustrates both the danger from
the blacks, and the one occasion when Phillip got out of patience
with them. In December 1790, a sergeant of marines, with three
convicts, among whom was M'Entire, the Governor's gamekeeper, a man
of whom Bennilong had always shown the utmost hatred and terror,
went out to shoot kangaroos in the vicinity of Botany Bay. About
midnight two natives were observed by the sergeant creeping towards
the camp with spears in their hands; and M'Entire spoke to them in
their own language, when one of them, without the least warning,
sent a spear into his left side. The wound was pronounced by the
surgeons to be mortal; then, writes Tench:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The poor wretch . . . began to utter the most dreadful
exclamations, and to accuse himself of the commission of crimes of
the deepest dye, accompanied with such expressions of his despair
of God's mercy as are too terrible to repeat. He lingered until the
20th of January, and then expired. From the aversion uniformly
shewn by all the natives to this unhappy man, he had long been
suspected by us of having in his excursions shot and injured them.
To gain information on this head from him, the moment of contrition
was seized. On being questioned with great seriousness, he,
however, declared that he had never fired but once on a native, and
then had not killed, but severely wounded him, and this in his own
defence. Notwithstanding this death-bed confession, most people
doubted the truth of the relation, from his general character and
other circumstances.'</p>
<p>Believing that the murder of M'Entire was quite unprovoked, the
Governor was determined to inflict a stern punishment upon the
natives. He, like many other cultured men, no doubt thought that
that instinctive desire to kill strangers, so predominant in savage
races, and termed bloodthirsty treachery by civilised people, was
deserving of severe reprisals&mdash;not realising that fear and
horror are the primary motives of attack. The party sent consisted
of two captains, two subalterns, and forty privates with
non-commissioned officers, and Tench was pitched upon to command
it.</p>
<p>'His Excellency informed me,' says Tench, 'that . . . if
practicable, we were to bring away two natives as prisoners; and to
put to death ten; that we were to destroy all weapons of war but
nothing else; that no hut was to be burned; that all women and
children were to remain uninjured, not being comprehended within
the scope of the order; that our operations were to be directed
either by surprize or open force; that after we had made any
prisoners, all communication, even with those natives with whom we
were in habits of intercourse, was to be avoided, and none of them
suffered to approach us; that we were to cut off and bring in the
heads of the slain, for which purpose hatchets and bags would be
furnished; and finally, that no signal of amity or invitation
should be used in order to allure them to us; or if made on their
part (was) to be answered by us; for that such conduct would be not
only present treachery, but give them reason to distrust every
future mark of peace and friendship on our part.'</p>
<p>Then Phillip gave his reasons.</p>
<p>'He said that since our arrival in the country, no less than
seventeen of our people had either been killed or wounded by the
natives; that he looked upon the tribe living on the
before-mentioned peninsula, and chiefly on the north arm of Botany
Bay, to be the principal aggressors; that against this tribe he was
determined to strike a decisive blow, in order at once to convince
them of our superiority, and to infuse an universal terror, which
might operate to prevent farther mischief. . . . That his motive
for having so long delayed to use violent measures had arisen from
believing that in every former instance of hostility, they had
acted either from having received injury, or from misapprehension.
To the latter of these causes, added he, "I attribute my own wound;
but in this business of M'Entire, I am fully persuaded . . . the
barbarity of their conduct admits of no extenuation . . . and I am
resolved to execute the prisoners who may be brought in, in the
most public and exemplary manner, in the presence of as many of
their countrymen as can be collected, after having explained the
cause of such a punishment, and my fixed determination to repeat it
whenever any future breach of good conduct on their side shall
render it necessary."'</p>
<p>Hunter&mdash;all honour to him&mdash;proposed that, instead of
destroying ten persons, the capture of six would better answer all
the purposes for which the expedition was to be undertaken; as out
of this number a part might be set aside for retaliation; and the
rest at a proper time liberated, after having seen the fate of
their comrades, and being made sensible of the cause of their own
detention.</p>
<p>'This scheme His Excellency was pleased instantly to adopt,
adding, "If six cannot be taken, let this number be shot. Should
you, however, find it practicable to take so many, I will hang two,
and send the rest to Norfolk Island for a certain period, which
will cause their countrymen to believe that we have despatched them
secretly."</p>
<p>'At four o'clock on the morning of the 14th we marched; . . .
provided with three days' provisions, ropes to bind our prisoners
with, and hatchets and bags, to cut off and contain the heads of
the slain. . . .'</p>
<p>Tench and his men spent two or three days in this attempt, but
the natives eluded capture, and says the narrator:&mdash;</p>
<p>'At one o'clock we renewed our march, and at three halted near a
fresh water swamp, where we resolved to remain until morning; that
is, after a day of severe fatigue, to pass a night of restless
inquietude, when weariness is denied repose by swarms of mosquitoes
and sand-flies, which in the summer months bite and sting the
traveller without measure or intermission. Next morning we bent our
steps homeward; and, after wading breast-high through two arms of
the sea, as broad as the Thames at Westminster, were glad to find
ourselves at Sydney between one and two o'clock in the
afternoon.'</p>
<p>This expedition against the natives, when compared with that
undertaken by Governor Arthur in Tasmania in 1830, was a very mild
affair. Settlers in the pursuance of private quarrels have murdered
more blacks than were killed by English officials during the whole
of their administration of the Colony. Even modern methods in
Africa, when compared with Phillip's treatment of the natives,
suffer by comparison.</p>
<p>Soon after this incident a serious rupture between the two races
occurred in this manner. A native named Ballooderry was accustomed
to catch fish and exchange them with the settlers at Parramatta.
Some convicts one day destroyed this man's canoe. Ballooderry
watched his opportunity, and retaliated by spearing a convict,
although Phillip had already punished the first aggressors. The
Governor would not allow Ballooderry to be punished for this, but
issued an order that he and his tribe were not to come near the
settlement. From that day the natives in the vicinity never visited
Parramatta.</p>
<p>After Phillip left the colony, no serious endeavour was made to
civilise the aborigines. The race, as we have said, is now fast
dying out. Whereas in the first Governor's time it was estimated,
as stated above, that on the shores of Port Jackson, Botany Bay,
and Broken Bay alone ** there were at least 1500 blacks; only a
stray one is ever seen in these localities now.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The Aborigines Protection Board, which sends
aboriginal children to school and supplies the blacks with blankets
and rations, in the annual report for 1896, states that the total
number of 'blacks' in New South Wales was 6984, 'of whom 3481 are
half-castes.']</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<p class="negindent1"><small>THE ANTAGONISM OF MAJOR ROSS&mdash;THE
MARINES&mdash;THE QUARREL BETWEEN ROSS AND HIS
OFFICERS&mdash;PHILLIP'S ACTION&mdash;ROSS'S OPINION OF THE
COLONY'S PROSPECTS&mdash;HIS COMPLAINTS&mdash;THE 'WATCH'
DISPUTE&mdash;PHILLIP'S FORBEARANCE&mdash;THE COURT-MARTIAL ON
MEREDITH&mdash;PHILLIP'S DETRACTORS&mdash;SOUTHWELL AND HIS
LETTERS.</small></p>
<p>P<small>HILLIP'S</small> administration possessed from the first
what is said to be one of the peculiar advantages of Parliamentary
forms of government&mdash;a strong Opposition, and the
Lieutenant-Governor was the leader thereof.</p>
<p>In his letters to his superiors in England, Ross condemned all
Phillip's acts and contradicted all the Governor's assertions as to
the colony's future. Posterity is the only true judge between the
'ins and the outs', and now that more than a hundred years have
elapsed since these two men did their duty, each according to his
lights, time has proved that Phillip was right and Ross was
wrong.</p>
<p>That branch of the service to which Ross belonged has, ashore
and afloat, earned for itself such fame that the very sight of a
marine's uniform in the streets of Sydney is to an Englishman there
what standing upon the deck of the old <i>Victory</i> at Portsmouth
must be to an Englishman at home. But there was no glory to be won
in the service which the marines were called upon to perform in the
colonisation of Australia.</p>
<p>Their work was mere routine garrison duty, the 'sentry go' of
barrack life, certainly with less food and more discomforts than
usual; but these were hardships suffered equally by everyone, from
Phillip to the youngest ship's boy.</p>
<p>If, through no fault of their own, the part of the marines was
an insignificant one, their commandant might well have played his
own in such a way as to make the piece run smoothly. But instead of
this, from Major Ross, we hear more of hardships suffered, of
offended dignity, and of a dozen other trivial grievances than from
all the other members of the expedition put together.</p>
<p>The men of the marine detachment volunteered on the conditions
that the non-commissioned officers and men should be given their
discharge, if they desired it, on their return to England, after
they had been relieved, at the expiration of three years; or could
be discharged abroad upon the relief, and be permitted to settle in
the country if they preferred it. And they were to be victualled by
a commissary, and to be given such tools, implements and utensils
as they needed whilst employed for the protection of the new
settlement.</p>
<p>In a letter from Ross to Nepean just before the fleet left
England, the Major wrote reminding him that he was leaving behind
him his wife and a 'very small tho' numerous' young family; that
his pay was his only means; and asked, in the event of his death,
that the Under-Secretary's interest would be given towards
procuring for his widow and fatherless children 'some compensation
from the public', winding up by appealing to that gentleman's own
feelings as a husband and father.</p>
<p>Then he tenders his thanks for 'the generous opinion you have
shown in favour of the corps,' and goes on to say, 'every nerve
shall be strain'd in the faithful and diligent discharge of our
duty, and I entertain not a doubt but that the conduct of the whole
will be such as will not only do credit to your recommendation' (of
the marines for the service), 'but give satisfaction to the
Administration. These much-wished-for objects obtain'd, I shall
then ardently hope that what you once hinted to me might be the
consequence, will, with your assistance, take place, and that we
shall no more return to our original obscurity, but become an
active corps of your own creation.' This was very judicious
letter-writing indeed.</p>
<p>The Admiralty sent instructions to Ross before he embarked, and
these instructions naturally contained no very detailed statement
of the work expected of them. They were 'not only to enforce due
subordination and obedience among the settlers, but were also for
the defence of the settlement against incursions by the natives,'
and the officer commanding the detachment was informed that he must
'follow such orders and directions as you shall from time to time
receive from His Majesty through one of his Principal Secretaries
of State, or the Governor of the settlement for the time
being.'</p>
<p>Phillip writing home a few months after landing,
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'As most of the officers have declined any kind of interference
with the convicts, except when immediately employed by themselves,
the little progress made in clearing land that requires so much
labour will be accounted for. A letter sent from the Admiralty to
the commanding officers of marines at Portsmouth and Plymouth is
what the officers say they govern themselves by, and in which they
say no extra duty is pointed out. What I asked of the officers was
so very little, and so far from being what would degrade either the
officer or the gentleman in our situation, that I beg leave once
more to report to your Lordship the request I made soon after we
landed, and which was made in the following words: "That officers
would, when they saw the convicts diligent, say a few words of
encouragement to them; and that when they saw them idle, or met
them straggling in the woods, they would threaten them with
punishment." This I only desired when officers could do it without
going out of their way; it was all I asked, and was pointedly
refused. They declared against what they called an interference
with convicts, and I found myself obliged to give up the little
plan I had formed in the passage for the government of these
people.'</p>
<p>The first serious difficulty with the marines, however, arose
between Ross and his officers. A court-martial had been held upon
one of the men for striking a comrade, and the officers comprising
the court found that the accused was guilty, and sentenced him
'either to ask public pardon before the battalion of William
Dempsey, the soldier whom he struck and injur'd, or to receive one
hundred lashes on his bare back, by the drummers of the detachment,
and where the commanding officer shall appoint.'</p>
<p>Ross ordered the court to reconsider this decision, on the
ground that the sentence of two punishments, with the choice left
to the prisoner which he would have inflicted, was illegal.</p>
<p>The members of the court, after reconsideration, said they were
of the same mind, whereupon Ross told them to consider themselves
under arrest. But as there were not enough officers in the
settlement to form a general court-martial to try the members of
the court, Phillip, after endeavouring to settle the dispute
amicably, ordered them to return to their duty, on the ground that
their services were necessary to the public.</p>
<p>The five officers (among whom was Tench) who composed this court
wrote to Phillip thanking him warmly for his endeavour to reconcile
the difference between them and Major Ross, but added that so
violent was the treatment they had received, and so disgraceful
their present situation, that they could not consent to have their
arrest taken off 'until a public reparation should have been made
for the indignity we have been used with.'</p>
<p>But much more serious than this dispute was the refusal of one
of the marine officers, and the reluctance of others, to sit as a
Criminal Court. By their act, had it been persisted in, the
Governor's authority would have been set at defiance by any convict
who chose to break the regulations of the settlement. Pounds weight
of despatches resulted from this affair, and it was not until the
opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown arrived from England in
1791 that it was finally settled.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General and Solicitor-General, in expressing the
opinion that officers were bound by the Act establishing the
Criminal Court to do as Phillip requested them, wound up their
letter with these common-sense remarks:&mdash;</p>
<p>'A military officer serving in New South Wales is bound to
perform the duty of a member of the Criminal Court when duly
summoned for that purpose . . . and will be guilty of a
misdemeanour by refusing to perform a duty imposed upon him by the
King's authority, derived from an Act of Parliament passed for the
purpose of giving that authority. We should, however, conceive that
persons of the liberal principles which belong to the character of
military officers, and who must know that the whole criminal
justice of the settlement will stand still if they should refuse to
serve in the Criminal Court, would be too much influenced by a
sense of the service which they can render to their country by
performing this civil function, in addition to their military duty,
to render it necessary to remind them of the nature of their duty
in this instance, as pointed out by charter and by Act of
Parliament.'</p>
<p>The refusal of one of the officers to sit ended by Phillip
sending for them all, 'in order,' he writes, 'to point out to them
the consequences which would follow their refusal of so essential a
part of their duty, and the officers I saw on that occasion assured
me that they had never doubted its being a part of their duty after
they heard the Act of Parliament and the commission read, which
established that court; but Major Ross, afterwards, on the 6th of
May, telling me that he was still of opinion that many of the
officers did not think the sitting as members of the Criminal Court
any part of their duty, I desired that he would assemble the
officers, that their separate opinions might be taken on that
head.'</p>
<p>In the despatch from which the above is extracted there are some
further statements which show how much Ross was responsible for
hampering the public service, and adding to the already almost
overwhelming anxieties of the Governor. The matter was adjusted for
the time by the officers taking Phillip's view of their position,
but Ross did all he could to prejudice them against Phillip by
stigmatising his conduct as unfair, saying that he 'thought it hard
officers should be obliged to sit as members of the Criminal Court,
and oppressive to the highest degree.'</p>
<p>'The consequences,' writes Phillip, 'which must have followed
had the officers in general been of that opinion will be obvious to
your Lordship; but as no legal inquiry could be made respecting the
conduct of the officer to whom, as the Lieutenant-Governor and
commandant of the detachment, I was naturally to look for support,
and from whom the situation of this colony at the time call'd for
an address of a very different nature, I did not think it proper to
direct any more officers to be sent for on that
subject,'&mdash;namely, that of learning their separate opinions on
the point at issue.</p>
<p>What Ross thought of the colony and its future prospects, and
what manner of man he was, is disclosed under his own hand. In a
letter to the Secretary of the Admiralty, written only six months
after landing, he has much to complain of and much to condemn.</p>
<p>In another letter to Under-Secretary Nepean, he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Take my word for it, there is not a man in this place but
wishes to return home, and indeed they have no less than cause, for
I believe there never was a set of people so much upon the parrish
as this garrison is, and what little we want, even to a single
nail, we must not send to the Commissary for it, but must apply to
His Excellency, and when we do he allways sayes there is but little
come out, and of course it is but little we get, and what we are
obliged to take as a mark of favor. If you want a true description
of this country, it is only to be found amongst many of the private
letters sent home; however, I will, in confidence, venture to
assure <i>you</i> that this country will never answer to settle in,
for although I think corn will grow here, yet I am convinced that
if ever it is able to maintain the people here, it cannot be in
less time than probably a hundred years hence. I therefore think it
will be cheaper to feed the convicts on turtle and venison at the
London Tavern than be at the expence of sending them here.'</p>
<p>Writing again to the Secretary of the Admiralty, Ross ventures
to 'intrude an opinion on their Lordships as to the utility of a
settlement on this coast.' 'This part of it, at least,' he writes,
'never can be made to answer the intended purpose or wish of the
Government, for the country seems totally destitute of everything
that can be an object for a commercial nation, a very fine harbour
excepted, and I much fear that the nature of the soil is such as
will not be brought to yield more than sufficient sustainance for
the needy emigrants whose desperate fortunes may induce them to try
the experiment. Here I beg leave to observe to their Lordships that
the above is but a private opinion. The Governor's I am
unacquainted with, as he has never done me the honor of informing
me of his, or asking me for mine; neither has he made me or any
other person that I know of acquainted with any part of the
intentions of Government, nor have I been let into any part of his
plan, which will, I hope, be a sufficient apology for the very lame
accounts in my power to give their Lordships, independant of what I
have already said. The face of the country round us produces
dreadful proofs of the devastation caused by the frequent
lightnings, besides our having been already visited by a shock of
an earthquake, which happened on the 22d of June.'</p>
<p>Then, after a woful tale about some of his live stock being
killed by lightning, he says: 'While I am on this subject I shall
take the liberty of mentioning to their Lordships the quantity of
provisions served to myself, the officers and men of the
detachment, in which there is now no difference between us and the
convicts, but in half a pint per day of Rio spirits, which in taste
and smell is extremely offensive. Indeed, I may say that nothing
short of absolute necessity could induce men to use it. What makes
this the more severely felt by many of us is our not having known
what we were to be supplied with till it was much too late to make
any other provision for ourselves.'</p>
<p>Fortunately for the future prosperity of the colony, the other
officers did not whine about their hardships, though Ross no doubt
gave them every encouragement to do so. Phillip sometimes came near
to losing his temper with the Major, who seemed to miss no chance
of harassing the Governor in every possible way. In a despatch to
Lord Sydney, dated 1st February 1790,* Phillip complains in a
dignified manner that 'as every obstacle thrown in the way of the
civil government is rendered doubly embarrassing from our situation
. . . I am under the disagreeable necessity of laying the following
particulars before your Lordship.' Then he states that for many
months past robberies had taken place, and he found it necessary to
establish a watch, the regulations of which he sent to Ross for his
opinion thereon. Ross approved, the watch was established, and did
its work so well that in three months not a single robbery was
committed in the night.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Phillip was not aware that Grenville had at this
date succeeded Sydney at the Home Office.]</p>
<p>The watch consisted of twelve convicts&mdash;men selected for
their good behaviour. Immediately after tattoo had beat they began
their patrol. 'No complaint was ever made of them', remarks
Phillip, and they were expressly cautioned to avoid disputes with
soldiers or seamen ( many of whom were as great thieves as the
convicts themselves). Soldiers and sailors when stopped by the
watch at night were taken to the guardhouse, from where they were
delivered by the officers if there was no criminal charge against
them. This had been done on several occasions. One night, however,
a soldier was found in the convicts' camp, and placed in the
custody of the guard. On the following morning, Ross sent the
adjutant to the Judge-Advocate (under whose immediate control
Phillip had placed the watch) with a message 'that he considered a
soldier being stopped, when not committing any unlawful act, as an
insult offered to the corps; that they would not suffer themselves
to be treated in that manner or be controuled by the convicts while
they had bayonets in their hands.'</p>
<p>Phillip at once sent for the Major and discussed the matter, and
tried to convince him of the necessity of the order, but Ross
sulked, and reiterated 'that it was an insult to the corps.' Then
for the sake of peace Phillip withdrew the order, 'for,' he wrote,
'it was not to be supposed that soldiers would quietly suffer
themselves to be stopped by a convict watchman after such
declarations from their commandant.' But Phillip would not have
yielded had Ross's message to the Judge-Advocate been repeated to
him in full: 'I beg leave to observe to your Lordship that the last
sentence, respecting the bayonets, was never mentioned to me till
after this business was settled, for if it had, I should not have
been induced to have withdrawn the order.' So pointed a menace, he
adds, could not tend to the good of the service or the preservation
of peace in general. Some idea of the unpleasant condition of
affairs is shown by another extract from the same letter.</p>
<p>'Officers have been put under arrest by their commandant, and
courts-martial have been demanded, and which have likewise been
requested by the officers in defence of their conduct, but no
inquiry into the conduct of any individual above the rank of a
non-commissioned officer can take place, and the consequences will
be obvious to your Lordship where so little harmony prevails
between the commandant and his officers. The strength of the
detachment consists of only eighteen officers, one of whom is on
duty at Norfolk Island, and a second has never done any duty since
he was appointed by Major Ross; of the sixteen remaining for the
duty of this settlement, five have been 'put under arrest by the
commandant, and are only doing duty till a general court-martial
can be assembled, in consequence of a sentence passed by them at a
battalion court-martial; a sixth officer is suspended in
consequence of a representation made by the corps of his
unofficerlike behaviour; a seventh is suspended by his commandant
for unofficerlike behaviour in taking a soldier who had been abused
by a convict to make his complaint to the magistrates without
having first given information to his commandant; and both adjutant
and quartermaster of the detachment have been equally under his
displeasure.'</p>
<p>In a subsequent letter to Nepean, the Governor, at this time, as
future chapters will show, harassed enough by the famine that was
in the land, thus unbosoms himself:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The Lieutenant-Governor has complained of that part of my
letter in which I requested that the peace of the settlement may
not be disturbed; but have I not had sufficient cause to make that
request? Has not representation or complaint been too frequent? Was
not the answer given to him by a convict followed by a behaviour on
the part of that wretch which drew on him a severe sentence from
the Criminal Court? Did not the Lieutenant-Governor, when that
convict was under examination, behave in such a manner to Captain
Hunter and the Judge-Advocate that the former wished to be excused
attending one day in the week as a Justice of the Peace, that he
might not subject himself in future to such treatment when acting
as a magistrate, and the latter wished to resign his office of
Judge-Advocate in consequence of the treatment he had received from
the Lieutenant-Governor and Captain Campbell in the presence of
convicts and others? I quote the words those officers made use of
when they represented that matter to me. And did not the
Lieutenant-Governor's conduct, as it appears from the evidence of
several of his officers, when Captain Campbell refused the duty of
the Criminal Court, bring this settlement to touch on the moment of
a general confusion.'</p>
<p>Then he alludes to the incessant grumbling of Ross about the bad
treatment his detachment had continuously received, and expresses
the opinion that the soldiers are much more comfortable than they
had reason to expect.</p>
<p>Ross returned to England by the same ship that brought formal
acknowledgments of some of these letters. In his reply, Lord
Grenville stated his strong disapproval of Ross's conduct, but took
the precaution of intimating that this opinion had been formed
subject to what the defence might have to say. Phillip, feeling
that he had been moderate in his statements, answered the Secretary
of State in very plain language:&mdash;</p>
<p>'As your Lordship's letter of the 19th of February 1791 has the
following words, "The proceedings of Major Ross and Captain
Campbell according to your representations," I beg that your
Lordship will permit me to say that the representations I have made
of the conduct of those officers are just and impartial, and which
do not admit of a doubt. I believe Major Ross's or Captain
Campbell's friends could not have represented their conduct in a
more favorable point of view, without having deviated from truth;
and the representations I made appeared to me to be necessary for
the good of His Majesty's service.'</p>
<p>The Government, however, seemed to have formed a just estimate
of the case. The marines were relieved in 1791, and Ross upon his
return home was not promoted.</p>
<p>The five officers who had been ordered to consider themselves
under arrest for refusing to alter their sentence on a prisoner
could not be tried in the colony, and on their return to England,
owing to the delay, the Admiralty declined to investigate their
case. But Captain Meredith, who while in the colony had been put
under arrest by Ross for some trivial cause, was tried at Plymouth,
and the court-martial brought this finding, which was duly approved
by the Admiralty:&mdash;</p>
<p>'That the court is of opinion the charge is groundless and
malicious&mdash;groundless because the charge is not proved in
either of its parts, and if it had been, was of a venial nature,
and for which ample atonement was made in the apology offered; and
malicious from the long duration of the arrest, and unusual and
unnecessary severity of it; and the court doth therefore honorably
acquit the prisoner. We have taken the said proceedings and
sentence into our consideration, and do hereby signify to you our
approval thereof.'</p>
<p>Ross soon after his return was appointed a recruiting officer to
his corps, and died while doing that duty at Ipswich in August
1793. What has been written of him is the reverse of complimentary,
but it must not be lost sight of that the Lieutenant-Governor's
faults were the results of his unfitness for the peculiar position
in which he was placed&mdash;he was merely the regulation pipeclay
type of soldier, doubtless brave and honourable, and eminently
fitted to lead a company. These qualifications in a soldier are
often enough to be found unaccompanied by intelligence or even by
common sense. Tact, good temper and a desire to 'make the best of a
bad job' were the qualities more needed than any other, and they
were not part of the Major's character.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Dawes was another officer of marines with whom the
Governor had disagreements. Dawes was an extremely useful man,
whose scientific knowledge had led to his appointment as engineer
and artillery officer, and to his being placed in charge of the
Observatory.</p>
<p>Like others of his brother officers, he did not get on well with
the Governor, who had cause to be angry with him for indulging in a
practice to which Phillip objected&mdash;exchanging provisions with
the convicts. A convict who acted as a sort of middleman was
detected, and stated that he had given Lieutenant Dawes 40 lbs. of
flour for 20 lbs. of sugar. Phillip had before this asked Ross to
point out to him the impropriety 'of purchasing pease from the
convicts.' These breaches of the regulations, petty as they appear,
were really serious, for the colony was sadly in want of food. On
another occasion Phillip ordered Dawes to accompany an expedition
against the blacks. Dawes, on the grounds that he had religious
objections to punishing blacks, refused to go, and persisted in
this refusal&mdash;remarkable conduct, to say the least of it, in a
soldier!</p>
<p>We have gone at some length into these disputes between the
marines and the Governor because, trivial as they may appear, they
contained all the elements necessary to create such a disturbance
in the settlement as might very easily have led to serious
consequences. A very few years later the military actually revolted
and deposed Governor Bligh. With what is known of Bligh's character
and the circumstances of his deposition, and what is shown in these
letters of Phillip, it is not too much to assume that disaster to
the young colony from these disputes between the military and
civilians was only averted by the even temper and forbearance of
the first Governor.</p>
<p>In this chapter we have endeavoured to show what Phillip's
contemporaries had to say against him, so that the worst of the man
as he appeared to them may be known, set against his services, and
balanced by the reader.</p>
<p>His remaining detractor&mdash;young Southwell&mdash;is amusing,
and his cause of quarrel obvious enough.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Dawes seems to have been a particular friend of his,
and he thus writes of that young gentleman:&mdash;</p>
<p>'One friend I cannot but mention, and I am sure you will esteem
him for my sake, and that is a Mr Dawes . . . . To give you his
character in few words, he is a most amiable man, and though young,
truly religious, without any appearance of formal sanctity. He is
kind to everyone; but I am speaking of his many affabilities to
myself.'</p>
<p>Others of his friends he mentions thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>'And as it is only between you and me, and I know you like such
little fid-fad, I will name a few. Captain Campbell, the commanding
officer of marines, and, when here. Major Ross; the author of the
printed narrative. Captain Tench, polite and sensible; several
other lieutenants, Mr Worgan, our surgeon, etc., are all very kind,
and sometimes, when I can, I visit them.'</p>
<p>We have quoted young Southwell before, it will be remembered,
and he had nothing to say against Phillip then. Early in 1790 he
was placed in charge of the signal station at the South Head of
Sydney Harbour, a somewhat lonely position for a youth of his
temperament. He seems about this time to have begun to have doubts
about the Governor.</p>
<p>He writes of Phillip as 'the pompous despot.' 'Our austere
Governor's behaviour alters not for the better . . . and I can
assure you I am not disposed to speak in his praise. . . . I am
rather vexed with myself for being so very lavish of my encomiums
formerly, but while a shadow of appearance remained that could
justify my sending pleasing accounts, I chose to do it for your
sakes.' Then comes a complaint that the Governor tried to prevent
his sending away letters by the <i>Scarborough</i>, and resented
his presence at the settlement&mdash;likely enough when Southwell
was so far away from his post. 'He had no better resource than the
sly pretence of fearing my being in camp might be prejudicial to my
morals: "What did I want with women and rogues?" My answer was
warm, being nettled, "nothing," and that I was certain he could
have nothing of that kind to bring against my conduct;' and then he
goes so far as to pen an accusation of Phillip's immoral relations
with some woman whom he does not name. The slander was doubtless
invented for Southwell by other people, who were too careful to put
about such a statement themselves. Yet in this same letter
Southwell says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Apropos, the Governor has this forenoon graciously sent me an
invitation to dine, a thing quite out of date a long time; but as I
was to eat some kid with Mr Palmer, I sent word I was indisposed,
but much obliged, etc., of course, and also going down to the
lookout to lay by a little. Observe, was it anything worse than a
common cold I wou'd not say anything about it in this to you; but I
truly assure you that is all, and I am a careful codger.'</p>
<p>The 'careful codger' soon after tells his mother that 'a more
agreeable turn has taken place lately in affairs, and his
disagreeable restrictions are taken off. He treats us with more
affability, and is all at once so polite as to beg of my only
companion, Mr Harris, and self, whenever we come to camp, to let
him have our company, and I am to-morrow (having been a long
stranger) to wait upon him by particular invitation.'</p>
<p>Next follows a long and tedious account of the hardships he has
endured, 'dragged round the world, made shake in our shoes off
Tasman's Head, and at length deprived of our poor old bark at
Norfolk Island,'&mdash;pitiful stuff from a young seaman.</p>
<p>When he said good-bye to the colony and to Governor Phillip, he
tells his mother that 'the Governor, at leave-taking, after a few
encomiums on my prudent deportment, good sense, parts, etc.,
lamenting it had not been in his power effectually to serve me,
etc., concluded with recommending it to me to quit the service. . .
. I gave him no reason to think that I felt myself obliged by that
part of the story, and only answered him by begging he would
recollect my time lost in the service, my connection by no means
affluent, and other difficulties. In reply, I had a repetition of
stale compliments, abilities very equal to something respectable in
some other way, and [he] wound all up by saying with some warmth
(it may be genuine) that should he return, and the gleam of any
possibility of his serving me offer, he would most heartily and
gladly do it in any part of the world or situation whatever.'</p>
<p>Many such letters as these were written to the Rev. W. Butler,
of Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, Southwell's uncle, and in the course of a
reply to one of them, that worthy gentleman thus delivers
himself:&mdash;</p>
<p>'I have not the happiness nor the honour of knowing your
Governor, but I never shall forget the expression of my friend
Captain John Faithful Fortescue, on talking about the new
administration under such good care: "Upon my soul, Butler," said
he, "I do think God Almighty made Phillip on purpose for the place,
for never did man better know what to do, or with more
determination to see it done; and yet, if they'll let him, he will
make them all very happy." Such a compliment, and from an officer
of like rank, was too striking to escape my remembrance. I have
quoted it fifty times, and don't doubt it has been verified a
thousand.'</p>
<p>When Southwell got home, he memorialised the Admiralty for
promotion, and his uncle asked Sir Joseph Banks to take charge of
his nephew's petition.</p>
<p>Sir Joseph, however, courteously declined, on the grounds that
if he solicited a boon from the Admiralty, it would be in favour of
Captain Cook's son, 'who, tho' his name stands higher in the
opinion of the nation than that of any former youngster has ever
done, is still a lieutenant of many years' standing.'</p>
<p>Poor young Southwell! One pictures the youth (for though he was
twenty-four, he was quite a child) in the bush at the signal
station, seven long miles from the home of the settlers, brooding
over his troubles, petty as they were, yet fully as great in his
eyes as were those of that 'pompous despot' the 'austere Governor'.
No doubt his friends Ross and Dawes in some measure stimulated his
grumbling, and it was not altogether his own selfish grievances
which made him thus bitter.</p>
<p>But yet the 'pompous despot' did possibly mean well by the young
man&mdash;those invitations to dinner were perhaps, after all,
signs of some kindness of heart and goodwill. And remember, as will
presently be shown, that the materials for dinner were at these
times very scarce, and asking a friend to share it was no mere
everyday politeness.</p>

<p class="negindent1"><small>KING SENT TO NORFOLK ISLAND&mdash;THE
EXPLORATIONS OF PHILLIP AND HIS OFFICERS&mdash;TENCH'S DESCRIPTION
OF THE COUNTRY SEEN&mdash;HIS POOR OPINION OF IT&mdash;THE BLUE
MOUNTAINS&mdash;KING AND HIS ISLAND COLONY&mdash;PLOT AND
DISASTER&mdash;THE HARVEST&mdash;PHILLIP'S FARM AT ROSE
HILL&mdash;A HOPEFUL LETTER HOME.</small></p>
<p>I<small>N</small> the annals of Australian exploration, the
stories of attempts to find a way over the Blue Mountains, and of
terrible journeys across the deserts in the heart of the continent,
Phillip has no place&mdash;these hazardous adventures came after
his day. When he landed in 1788, his only map was Cook's chart of
the continent, and on its eastern boundary line from north to south
the famous navigator had surveyed the whole sea coast so thoroughly
that the names he gave crowd one another upon the chart. But here,
upon the edge. Cook's work ended and Phillip's began.</p>
<p>On the map as it was after the first Governor had marked all his
discoveries upon it, the piece cut out of the big territory is very
small indeed, but to win that little in the time, and in the face
of the difficulties encountered by the first explorers, is of
itself evidence enough of his tireless energy.</p>
<p>The first and greatest proof of Phillip's sagacity was his
selection of a site for the settlement. The city of Sydney is a
monument for all time to its founder. How it came about that Port
Jackson was chosen in place of Botany Bay is shown in Phillip's
first despatch, already quoted.</p>
<p>The Governor lost little time after landing at Port Jackson
before still further extending his dominions. On the 15th of
February&mdash;scarcely more than a fortnight after the ships had
entered Sydney Cove&mdash;the <i>Supply</i> was sent to Norfolk
Island. King, who was given the command of the island, was, as has
been said, the friend of Phillip. He had served before under the
Governor, and although twenty years younger than his chief, the
lieutenant of thirty was unquestionably the ablest officer on the
staff. By sending King to Norfolk Island, the Governor, actuated by
the highest motives, cut himself off from the society of his best
friend, but King's energetic and wise administration justified
Phillip's choice.</p>
<p>Very soon after landing, Phillip saw the necessity of going
further afield for farming land. No land suitable for agriculture
was to be found on the shores of Port Jackson, and so he set out to
examine Broken Bay. Describing this journey he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The 2d of March I went with a longboat and cutter to examine
the broken land mentioned by Captain Cook about eight miles to the
northward of Port Jackson. We slept in the boat that night within a
rocky point, in the north-west part of the bay (which is very
extensive), as the natives, though very friendly, appeared to be
numerous; and the next day, after passing a bar that had only water
for small vessels, entered a very extensive branch, from which the
ebb tide came out so strong that the boats could not row against it
in the stream; and here was deep water. It appeared to end in
several small branches, and in a large lagoon that we could not
examine for want of time to search for a channel for the boats
amongst the banks of sand and mud.'</p>
<p>After describing the other branches of Broken Bay, one of which
he 'honoured with the name of Pitt Water', he goes on as follows:
'We found small springs of water in most of the coves, and saw
three cascades falling from a height which the rains then rendered
inaccessible. I returned to Port Jackson after being absent eight
days in the boats. Some of the people feeling the effects of the
rain, which had been almost constant, prevented my returning by
land, as I intended, in order to examine a part of the country
which appeared open and free from timber.'</p>
<p>A few weeks later he repeated these explorations, and this time
found good land.</p>
<p>No mere pleasure excursions these journeys into the interior,
although some of the places visited by these early explorers are
nowadays favourite picnic grounds. For instance, the large lake he
next describes is now known as Lake Narrabeen&mdash;a spot which is
to the Sydney holiday-maker as familiar as Hampstead Heath or
Richmond is to the Londoner.</p>
<p>In one of his many short but careful examinations of the shores
near Port Jackson, Phillip found a deep water passage leading into
a branch of the harbour that trended north-west. Finding fresh
water at the head of the bay, he resolved to make further
exploration; and a few days later set out with a small party of
officers and marines. 'To the northward of this part of the
harbour,' he writes, 'we found a large lake, which we examined,
though not without great labour, for it is surrounded with a bog
and large marsh, in which we were frequently up to the middle.
There we saw a black swan; it was larger than the common swan, and
when it rose after being fired at, the wings appeared to be edged
with white; there is some red on its bill, and it is a very noble
bird. . . . In three days we got round the swamps and marshes, from
which all the fresh water drains that this harbour is supplied
with. The country we past through when we left the low grounds was
the most rocky and barren I ever saw; the ascending and descending
of the mountains being practicable only in particular places, but
covered with flowering shrubs; and when about fifteen miles from
the sea-coast we had a very fine view of the mountains inland. . .
. From the rising of these mountains I did not doubt but that a
large river would be found.'</p>
<p>To determine this matter the energetic Governor led another
party, consisting of eleven officers and men, with six days'
provisions, into the interior. Leaving the settlement in a boat
they landed at the head of the harbour, and for three days the
little party marched westward through country which Phillip
describes as fine as any he had ever seen, clothed with large
timber and, except in occasional places where the soil was poor and
stony, without any undergrowth. In general the land was level or
else undulating, which gave it a very pleasant and picturesque
appearance. On the fifth day they reached more elevated country,
and saw hills to the southward. So beautiful did the Governor
consider this part of the country that he named the place from
which he surveyed it Bellevue. Want of provisions now compelled him
to return, though water was everywhere plentiful in pools. But the
presence of these could not be depended upon as they advanced, and
therefore the party always carried their water with them; this,
with the provisions, arms and two tents, obliged every officer and
private to carry each a very heavy load. They returned to the head
of the harbour in a day and a half, following a marked tree track
on their return. Thirty miles of country had been
explored&mdash;country that in Phillip's opinion could be
cultivated with ease. He, and indeed everyone that accompanied him
were anxious to return and penetrate further into the interior in
the hope of finding a large river, but the exposure undergone by
the Governor at Broken Bay was now telling upon him, and his ardent
spirit had to submit to a few weeks' rest. His hopes were raised,
however, and he wrote that he now knew that there was good country
near the settlement, and that it should be settled in the
spring.</p>
<p>Tench&mdash;the only one of the old chroniclers who in his
writings makes a departure from the hard, matter-of-fact, official
style of the others&mdash;thus writes of one of these exploring
expeditions undertaken in April 1791, to ascertain whether or not
the Hawkesbury and the Nepean were the same river:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The party consisted of twenty-one persons, including the
Governor and our friends Colbee (Coleby) and Boladeree
(Ballooderry). Their equipment,' he says, 'will convey to those who
have rolled along on turnpike roads only', some idea of what these
explorations meant.</p>
<p>Every man carried his own knapsack, which contained provisions
for ten days, a gun, blanket and canteen&mdash;40 lbs. weight in
all; then to this were added cooking utensils and a hatchet, and
they were 'garbed to drag through morasses, tear through thickets,
ford rivers and scale rocks.' It will be seen from these few lines
alone that Phillip and his officers did not rust in the settlement,
and let the country develop itself, as some writers, with but scant
knowledge of the early days of the colony, imagine was the
case.</p>
<p>This particular expedition started from the Governor's house at
Rose Hill&mdash;some miles from the main settlement&mdash;and first
travelled to the N.E. for the greater part of the day, 'after
which,' says Tench, 'we turned to N. 34 West . . . until we halted
for the night. Our method was to steer by compass, noting the
different courses as we proceeded; and counting the number of
paces, of which two thousand two hundred, on good ground, were
allowed to be a mile. At night, when we halted, all these courses
were separately cast up, and worked by a traverse table . . . so we
always knew exactly where we were, and how far from home: an
unspeakable advantage in a new country, where one hill and one tree
is so like another, that fatal wanderings would ensue without it.'
Here Tench pays a high compliment to the ardour and skill of
Lieutenant Dawes, who worked the traverses. 'The country for the
first two miles, while we walked to the north-east, was good, full
of grass, and without rock or underwood; afterwards it grew very
bad, being full of steep barren rocks, over which we were compelled
to clamber for seven miles, when it changed to a plain country,
apparently very sterile. . . . Our fatigue in the morning had,
however, been so oppressive that one of the party knocked up. And
had not a soldier, as strong as a pack-horse, undertaken to carry
his knapsack in addition to his own, we must either have sent him
back or have stopped at a place for the night which did not afford
water.'</p>
<p>The two blacks who accompanied the party, says Tench, 'walked
stoutly, appeared but little fatigued, and maintained their spirits
admirably, laughing to excess when any of us either tripped or
stumbled. . . . At a very short distance from Rose Hill, we found
that they were in a country unknown to them; so that the farther
they went, the more dependant on us they became, being absolute
strangers inland. We asked Colbee the name of the people who live
inland, and he called them Boo-roo-ber-on-gal, and said they were
bad; whence we conjectured that they sometimes warred with those on
the sea-coast, by whom they were undoubtedly driven up the country
from the fishing-ground, that it might not be overstocked; the
weaker here, as in every other country, giving way to the stronger.
We asked how they lived. He said on birds and animals, having no
fish. . . . About an hour after sunset, as we were chatting by the
fire side, and preparing to go to rest, we heard voices at a little
distance in the wood. Our natives catched the sound
instantaneously, and bidding us be silent, listened attentively to
the quarter whence it had proceeded. In a few minutes we heard the
voices plainly; and wishing exceedingly to open a communication
with this tribe, we begged our natives to call to them, and bid
them to come to us, to assure them of good treatment, and that they
should have something given them to eat. Colbee no longer
hesitated, but gave them the signal of invitation in a loud, hollow
cry. After some whooping and shouting on both sides, a man with a
lighted stick in his hand advanced near enough to converse with us.
The first words which we could distinctly understand were, "I am
Colbee, of the tribe of Cad-i-gal." The stranger replied, "I am
Ber-ee-wan, of the tribe of Boo-roo-ber-on-gal." Boladeree informed
him also of his name, and that we were white men and friends, who
would give him something to eat. Still he seemed irresolute. Colbee
therefore advanced to him, took him by the hand, and led him to us.
By the light of the moon we were introduced to this gentleman, all
our names being repeated in form by our two masters of the
ceremonies, who said that we were Englishmen, and Bud-ye-ree
(good), that we came from the sea-coast, and that we were
travelling inland.'</p>
<p>The strange black stayed some time conversing with his
countrymen, and then left, highly pleased with a present of
provisions. At nine o'clock on the following morning the party
reached the river, which at the point where it was struck was
'about three hundred and fifty feet wide; the water pure and
excellent to the taste.' The banks were high, covered with trees,
many of which, Tench remarked, were 'bent by the force of the
current. . . . Some of them contained rubbish and drift wood in
their branches, at least forty-five feet above the level of the
stream. . . . Our natives had evidently never seen this river
before; they stared at it with surprise. . . . Their total
ignorance of the country, and of the direction in which they had
walked, appeared when they were asked which way Rose Hill lay, for
they pointed almost oppositely to it. Of our compass they had taken
early notice, and had talked much to each other about it; they
comprehended its use, and called it "Naa-Moro," literally, "To see
the way." A more significant or expressive term cannot be
found.'</p>
<p>Following the course of the river downwards, and keeping as
close as possible to the bank, the party, suffering greatly from
fatigue caused by the impediments to walking&mdash;scrub and swampy
ground&mdash;at last reached a deep creek which effectually barred
their progress. They therefore followed its course till nightfall,
and then halted. 'Our natives,' says Tench, 'continued to hold out
stoutly. The hindrances to walking by the river side, which plagued
and entangled us so much, seemed not to be heeded by them, and they
wound through them with ease; but to us they were intolerably
tiresome. Our perplexities afforded them an inexhaustible fund of
merriment and derision. Did the sufferer, stung at once with
nettles and ridicule, and shaken nigh to death by his fall, use any
angry expression to them, they retorted in a moment by calling him
by every opprobrious name which their language affords. Boladeree
destroyed a native hut to-day very wantonly, before we could
prevent him. On being asked why he did so, he answered that the
inhabitants inland were bad; though no longer since than last
night, when Bereewan had departed, they were loud in their praise.
But now they had reverted to their first opinion&mdash;so fickle
and transient are their motives of love and hatred.</p>
<p>'We set out on the following morning, and continued to trace the
creek. The country which we passed through yesterday was good and
desirable to what was now presented to us; it was in general high,
and universally rocky. "Toiling our uncouth way," we mounted a hill
and surveyed the contiguous country. To the northward and eastward
the ground was still higher than that we were upon; but in a
south-west direction we saw about four miles. The view consisted of
nothing but trees growing on precipices; not an acre of it could be
cultivated. We saw . . . several vestiges of the natives. To
comprehend the reasons which induce an Indian to perform many of
the offices of life is difficult; to pronounce that which could
lead him to wander amidst these dreary wilds baffles penetration. .
. . We reached the head of the creek, passed it, and scrambled with
infinite toil and difficulty to the top of a neighbouring mountain,
whence we saw the adjacent country, in almost every direction, for
many miles. I record with regret that this extended view presented
not a single gleam of change, which could encourage hope or
stimulate industry to attempt its culture. We had, however, the
satisfaction to discover plainly the object of our pursuit,
Richmond Hill, distant about eight miles in a contrary direction
from what we had been proceeding upon. It was readily known to
those who had been up the Hawkesbury in the boats, by a remarkable
cleft or notch which distinguished it. It was now determined that
we should go back to the head of the creek and pass the night
there, and in the morning cut across the country to that part of
the river which we had first hit upon yesterday, and thence to
trace upward, or to the left. But before I descend, I must not
forget to relate that to this pile of desolation on which, like the
fallen angel on the top of Niphates, we stood contemplating our
nether Eden, His Excellency was pleased to give the name of Tench's
Prospect Mount.'</p>
<p>For several pages Tench goes on describing his journey, until at
last, after a week spent in this rough travelling, he
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'We resolved to abandon our pursuit, and to return home. . . .
The country we passed through was for the most part very
indifferent, according to our universal opinion. It is in general
badly watered; for eight miles and a half on one line we did not
find a drop of water.'</p>
<p>The mountains inland of which Phillip 'had a very fine view'
were the Blue Mountains, and for nearly a quarter of a century
after his departure from the colony they remained an impassable
barrier to the westward. He made repeated journeys into the
interior, discovered the Hawkesbury River, reached the foot of the
Blue Mountains, gave them, from the blue mist which hung over their
peaks, their appropriate name, and sent parties to endeavour to
penetrate their mysteries. In this they failed, but discovered the
Nepean, the source to-day of Sydney's ample water supply.</p>
<p>Topographical details of all these excursions would be wearisome
and out of place here, but the main advantage obtained by this
thorough examination of the surrounding country was the
establishment of the farms at Rose Hill. This agricultural
settlement in the neighbourhood of what is now the old town of
Parramatta was planned by Phillip, and from the success of its
first settler dates the beginning of the young colony's
self-dependence.</p>
<p>At headquarters an heroic attempt was made, in spite of the
rocky soil, to grow something. A farm was cleared in the cove next
to Sydney, and about nine acres of corn planted. The place is now
the site of the Botanic Gardens, and the bay formed by its shores,
like many another of the inlets of Port Jackson, commemorates by
its name&mdash;Farm Cove&mdash;the earliest times of settlement.
To-day in Farm Cove are the moorings of the fifteen modern warships
which form the Australian Squadron. Other bays named by Phillip are
Careening Cove, Sirius Cove, and Neutral Bay, the last named set
apart by the first Governor's port regulations as a place where,
should foreign vessels enter the harbour, they were to be moored.
The great ocean liners of the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient
Companies now anchor in this bay, and the surrounding once green
hills have been converted into streets of suburban residences.</p>
<p>While Phillip was getting his land into cultivation, King was
rapidly converting his ten square miles of territory&mdash;Norfolk
Island&mdash;into a valuable possession for the main
settlement.</p>
<p>On his way to Norfolk Island, Lieutenant Ball, the commander of
the <i>Supply</i>, discovered and named Lord Howe Island, and on
the return trip surveyed and annexed it to Phillip's territory. The
little island is distant from Sydney about 440 miles, and is now
occupied by some seventy or eighty settlers, mostly old whaling
seamen and people with a taste for a secluded life, which, as there
is little communication with the mainland, their lonely retreat
(notwithstanding that it is, for election purposes, within one of
the metropolitan electorates) enables them to gratify.</p>
<p>Lieutenant King did not have an altogether pleasant time of it
in his independent command. A few months after landing, the
<i>Supply</i>, which made regular trips between the island and the
mainland, brought the news to Sydney of a daring plot formed by the
convicts to capture the island and then make their escape. Their
plan was ingenious enough in some respects. It was intended that,
on the first Saturday after the arrival of any ship except the
<i>Sirius</i> at the island. King should be seized. Saturday was
chosen, for the reason that on this day it was his practice to
visit a farm which he had established in the interior, and the
military were also usually away at the same time bringing in
cabbage palm from the woods. The commandant was to be kidnapped
while on his way to the farm. Then a message in King's name was to
entice Mr Jamieson, the surgeon, away; he was to be captured in the
same manner as King; and the sergeant and small military guard were
to be similarly treated. These all being properly disposed of, the
ship was to be signalled to send her boat on shore, and the crew
were to be made prisoners. This accomplished, some convicts were to
go off to the ship in a boat belonging to the island, and tell the
captain that the ship's boat had been stove in, and that the
commandant requested that another might be sent. The crew of this
were also to be captured; and then the ship was to be boarded and
seized, and the mutineers were to sail her to Otaheite (Tahiti) in
the South Seas, and there found a settlement. They intended,
however, to leave some provisions for Mr King and his command.
Fortunately for the commandant, the plot was revealed to his
gardener&mdash;a seaman belonging to the <i>Sirius</i>&mdash;by a
female convict who was living with him.</p>
<p>'Mr King had hitherto, from the peculiarity of his
situation&mdash;secluded from society, and confined to a small
speck in the vast ocean, with but a handful of people&mdash;drawn
them round him, and treated them with the kind attentions which a
good family meets with at the hands of a humane master; but he now
saw them in their true colours, and one of his first steps when
peace was restored was to clear the ground as far as possible round
the settlement, that future villainy might not find a shelter in
the woods for its transactions. To this truly providential
circumstance, perhaps, many of the colonists afterwards were
indebted for their lives.'</p>
<p>In the last days of February, King, whose heart was set on his
being able to send Phillip a good report of the place and some
supplies as well, had a bitter disappointment. It began to blow
early on the morning of the 26th, and by noon 'the gale increased
to a hurricane, with torrents of heavy rain. Every instant pines
and live oaks of the largest dimensions were borne down by the fury
of the blast, which, tearing up roots and rocks with them, left
chasms of eight or ten feet depth in the earth. Those pines that
were able to resist the wind bent their tops nearly to the ground;
and nothing but horror and desolation everywhere presented itself.
. . . The gardens, public and private, were wholly destroyed;
cabbages, turnips and other plants were blown out of the ground;
and those which withstood the hurricane seemed as if they had been
scorched. An acre of Indian corn which grew in the vale, and which
would have been ripe in about three weeks, was totally destroyed.'
Poor King! But his was not a nature to be daunted by misfortune. He
at once began the work so ruthlessly destroyed over again; and
fortunately the health of the people of his little colony was good.
There were at this time on Norfolk Island 16 free people, 51 male
and 26 female convicts, and 4 children.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding insurrections and hurricanes. King made good
progress with his agriculture, for in December 1789 we are told
that 'Lieutenant King wrote that he expected his harvest would
produce from four to six months' flour for all his inhabitants,
exclusive of a reserve of double seed for twenty acres of ground.
Beside this promising appearance, he had ten acres in cultivation
with Indian corn, which looked very well.'</p>
<p>Not much in all this, it may be said, but remember always that
the men responsible were but rough sailors, whose business in life
hitherto had not been Empire-building. Remember, too, that Hawser
Trunnion and Hatchway are accepted types of the naval officers of
the period, created by Smollett only thirty years earlier, and
though to some extent exaggerations, still not very far from the
truth. Yet, compare Phillip and King with Trunnion and
Hatchway!</p>
<p>At Rose Hill (so named after one of the Secretaries to the
Treasury) the soil was free from the rock which everywhere
prevented cultivation nearer Sydney, and Phillip early in 1790
wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>'As near two years have now passed since we first landed in this
country, some judgment may be formed of the climate, and I believe
a finer or more healthy climate is not to be found in any part of
the world. Of 1030 people who were landed, many of whom were worn
out by old age, the scurvy, and various disorders, only seventy-two
have died in one-and-twenty months; and by the surgeon's returns it
appears that twenty-six of those died from disorders of long
standing, and which it is more than probable would have carried
them off much sooner in England. Fifty-nine children have been born
in the above time. . . .</p>
<p>'In December the corn at Rose Hill was got in; the corn was
exceeding good. About two hundred bushels of wheat and sixty of
barley, with a small quantity of flax, Indian corn, and oats, all
which is preserved for seed. Here I beg leave to observe to your
Lordship that if settlers are sent out, and the convicts divided
amongst them, this settlement will very shortly maintain itself,
but without which this country cannot be cultivated to any
advantage. At present I have only one person (who has about an
hundred convicts under his direction) who is employed in
cultivating the ground for the publick benefit, and he has returned
the quantity of corn above mentioned into the publick store. The
officers have not raised sufficient to support the little stock
they have. Some ground I have had in cultivation will return about
forty bushels of wheat into store, so that the produce of the
labour of the convicts employed in cultivation has been very short
of what might have been expected, and which I take the liberty of
pointing out to your Lordship in this place, to show as fully as
possible the state of this colony, and the necessity of the
convicts being employed by those who have an interest in their
labour. The giving convicts to the officers has been hitherto
necessary, but it is attended with many inconveniences, for which
the advantages arising to the officers do not make amends. It will
not therefore be continued after the detachment is relieved, unless
particularly directed. The plan I should propose for giving the
convicts to settlers will be submitted to your Lordship's
consideration in another letter. The numbers employed in
cultivation will, of course, be increased as the necessary
buildings are finished, but which will be a work of time; for the
numbers in this settlement who do nothing towards their own support
exceed those employed for the public.'</p>
<p>The Governor was so pleased with his farm that he took up his
residence there in order personally to superintend its
cultivation.</p>
<p>The labourers on the settlement were in charge of Phillip's
man-servant, who came from England with his master. Collins
describes the man as one who 'joined to much agricultural knowledge
a perfect idea of the labour to be required from, and that might be
performed by, the convicts; and his figure was calculated to make
the idle and the worthless shrink if he came near them.</p>
<p>A town was laid out at Rose Hill, with a street a mile long, and
on the King's birthday&mdash;4th June 1791&mdash;the place was
named Parramatta. In the old cemetery at the town there still
stands the tombstone of the man who surveyed it, and the stone
bears this inscription:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Sacred to the memory of Augustus Theodore Henry Alt, Baron of
Hesse Cassel, who died January 9, 1815, aged 84 years; late
Surveyor-General of New South Wales, at the first settling of this
colony, which situation he held till superannuated. He served in
the Guards in George the Second's reign; was Aide-de-Camp to Prince
Ferdinand at the battle of Minden (1759), and Captain in the Royal
Manchester Volunteers at the Siege of Gibraltar under General
[Elliot] (1781), where he distinguished himself in a gallant
manner. He died universally regretted by all his friends, who lost
in the Baron a Most Compleat Gentleman, and also one who never told
an untruth to the injury of any man. This monument was erected by
his Nephew, Matthew Bowles Alt, Lieutenant in His Majesty's Royal
Navy, as a Tribute of Respect to the conduct of his respected
uncle.'</p>
<p>All this so far is trivial, perhaps uninteresting, but then
Australia has no history, and Phillip's farming experiments, and
the condition of his crops were of real importance to the infant
colony, for grim famine was at this time beginning to loom upon the
horizon.</p>

NORFOLK ISLAND&mdash;APPROACH OF FAMINE&mdash;STARVATION
ALLOWANCE&mdash;LOSS OF THE 'SIRIUS'.</small></p>
<p>E<small>ARLY</small> in 1789 it became apparent to Phillip that
something had gone wrong with the storeships, which, with a
childlike faith in the Government, he fully believed must have long
before left England with supplies for the settlement. If either of
the victuallers which sailed with the First Fleet had come to grief
on the passage out&mdash;and there was no more likely
contingency&mdash;the colony, months before the arrival of a second
supply of stores, would have been actually starving. The
possibility of this had been foreseen by Phillip and pointed out to
Lord Sydney, but his lordship seems to have been easy in his mind,
imagining no doubt that this paragraph in the 'Instructions' would
be faithfully carried out:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The increase of the stock of animals must depend entirely upon
the measures you may adopt on the outset for their preservation,
and as the settlement will be amply supplied with vegetable
productions, and most likely with fish, fresh provisions, excepting
for the sick and convalescents, may in a great degree be dispensed
with. For these reasons it will become you to be extremely cautious
in permitting any cattle, sheep, hogs, etc., intended for
propagating the breed of such animals, to be slaughtered, until a
competent stock may be acquired, to admit of your supplying the
settlement from it with animal food without having further recourse
to the places from whence such stock may have originally been
obtained.'</p>
<p>But fish were so scarce that even the blacks were unable to
catch them, and were starving, and the 'vegetable productions' were
as yet not forthcoming.</p>
<p>In all his despatches home Phillip never once despairs, never
even complains. He tells the truth, puts down in figures how many
people there are to feed, how little food there is to give them,
and what is wanted to keep the colony alive, and ends his letters
with the cheerful assurance that they will still pull through all
right. We have seen how Major Ross wrote to England and what he had
to say of things at this time, and his letters, with other dismal
accounts, were published in the London papers. White, the principal
surgeon, wrote * :&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* This letter was published in the <i>Public
Advertiser</i> on the 31st December 1790, appropriately addressed
to 'Mr Skill, dealer in hams, tongues, salt salmon, etc., in the
Strand.']</p>
<p>'Much cannot now be done, limited in food and reduced as the
people are, who have not had one ounce of fresh animal food since
first in the country; a country and place so forbidding and so
hateful as only to merit execration and curses, for it has been a
source of expence to the mother country and of evil and misfortune
to us, without there ever being the smallest likelihood of its
repaying or recompencing either. From what we have already seen we
may conclude that there is not a single article in the whole
country that in the nature of things could prove of the smallest
use or advantage to the mother country or the commercial world. In
the name of heaven, what has the Ministry been about? Surely they
have quite forgotten or neglected us, otherwise they would have
sent to see what had become of us, and to know how we were likely
to succeed. However, they must soon know from the heavy bills which
will be presented to them, and the misfortunes and losses which
have already happened to us, how necessary it becomes to relinquish
a scheme that in the nature of things can never answer. It would be
wise by the first steps to withdraw the settlement, at least such
as are living, or remove them to some other place; this is so much
out of the world and tract of commerce that it could never answer.
How a business of this kind (the expence of which must be great)
could first be thought of without sending to examine the country,
as was Captain Thompson's errand to the coast of Africa, is to
every person here a matter of great surprise.'</p>
<p>Most of these letters were written privately to friends in
England, and the friends no doubt thought the best thing to do with
them was to send them to the newspapers, where they were generally
published as from 'Officers at Botany Bay.' Another letter,
identified as coming from Tench, says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'By the time this reaches you, the fate of this settlement and
all it contains will be decided. It is now more than two years
since we landed here, and within a month less than three since we
left England. So cut off from intercourse with the rest of mankind
are we, that, subsequent to the month of August 1788, we know not
of any transaction that has happened in Europe, and are no more
assured of the welfare or existence of any of our friends than of
what passes in the moon. It is by those only who have felt the
anguish and distress of such a state that its miseries can be
conceived.</p>
<p>'The little European knowledge that we are masters of we picked
out of some old English newspapers which were brought from the Cape
of Good Hope about a twelvemonth back in the <i>Sirius</i>, by
which ship you may possibly recollect to have received a letter
from me, dated 1st October 1788: but as to all family news, all
knowledge of our private affairs, or little endearing accounts
which no man, I presume, is without a wish to receive, nothing but
a blank for the long space of three years has been presented to us.
But great as our anxiety on this head is, it falls short of what we
suffer on another account. The dread of perishing by famine stares
us in the face; on the day I write we have but eight weeks'
provision in the public stores, and all chance of a reinforcement
under seven months is cut off, unless ships from England should
yet, notwithstanding the lateness of the season, come in upon us.
The hope of this is, however, very feeble, for, without the most
shameful and cruel inattention on your part, ships must have left
England by the first of August last to come here: and if so, they
have undoubtedly perished on their route. Even this alternative,
dreadful as it is, is less inflicting than to believe that our
country would send us out here as a sacrifice to famine and the
savages of the place, who, if ever they shall by any means learn
our situation, will prove extremely troublesome.' . . . Then the
writer goes on to say that the 'pride, pomp and circumstance of
war' are at an end with the garrison, for none of the soldiers have
boots! . . . After having suffered as they have, he says it will be
hard for them on their return to England 'to meet the sneers of a
set of holiday troops, whose only employ has been to powder their
hair, polish their shoes, etc. . . . though I must admit that our
gait and raggedness will give them some title to be merry at our
expence.' So continuously had they been employed that no military
manoeuvre of any consequence had been practised since the
detachment left England. And he concludes by saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The country is past all dispute a wretched one, a very
wretched, and totally incapable of yielding to Great Britain any
return for colonizing it. Amidst its native productions I cannot
number one which is valuable as an article of commerce. There is no
wood fit for naval purposes; no fibrous grass or plant from which
cloth can be made; no substance which can improve or aid the
labours of the manufacturer; no mineral productions; no esculent
vegetables worth 'the care of collecting and transporting to other
climes; and lastly, which is of the most serious consideration, no
likelihood that the colony will be able to support itself in grain
or animal food for many years to come, so that a regular annual
expence is entailed on the mother country as long as it is
kept.'</p>
<p>Ross we have already quoted. So early as July 1788 he wrote that
'the country would not support itself for a hundred years.' Another
writer described it as 'the outcast of God's works.'</p>
<p>The first news from the settlement sent home <i>via</i> China by
the returning transports did not reach England until March 1789,
when letters down to November 1788 all came in together. No
storeship had up to that date been ordered for despatch to Botany
Bay.</p>
<p>The Home Office was at this time the department for the
administration of the Colonies,** and Sydney, who was at the head
of it, did not even reply to Phillip's despatches, but in April he
gave instructions that a man-of-war should be got in readiness to
carry provisions to the settlement. At the same time he arranged
for the despatch of another batch of convicts, totally disregarding
Phillip's statements that clothing, implements and provisions were
urgently needed, and that more useless mouths to feed would mean
disaster.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The office of Secretary of State for the
Colonies was not created until 1854.]</p>
<p>In June 1789 Lord Sydney resigned office and was succeeded by
Lord Grenville.*** His first despatch to Phillip was the first
communication, after more than three years' absence from England,
that Phillip had received from his superiors.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Then the Right Hon. W.W. Grenville.]</p>
<p>In this letter Grenville informs the Governor of the receipt of
his despatches; that His Majesty has been pleased to approve of his
conduct of the 'arduous and important service' committed to his
care; and that the ship <i>Lady Juliana</i> had been taken up by
the Government to convey to Port Jackson about 240 female convicts,
with a consignment of implements, clothing and provisions. The
convicts upon arrival were to be transferred to Phillip to be
employed as would be most conducive to the advantage of the colony.
The attention given by the Governor to the separation of the
convicts of different sexes on the voyage out of the First Fleet is
duly commended, and a 'well-grounded hope' is expressed that he
will continue to promote matrimonial connection between the
unmarried people.</p>
<p>This unpleasant intelligence concerning the <i>Lady
Juliana</i>'s cargo was, however, followed by the news that the
<i>Guardian</i>, man-of-war, was to sail a fortnight after the
transport with about three times the quantity of stores embarked on
the former, 'which,' Grenville adds, 'excepting in the article of
provisions, you will find nearly to correspond with the estimates
accompanying your letters.' But the Secretary of State was careful
to add that the supplies had been procured at a very considerable
expense, and it was hoped that Phillip would make the most of them.
He was further informed that in the autumn the Government expected
to send out another 1000 convicts of both sexes, and the
unfortunate man, already worried and overworked, was enjoined to
make arrangements 'for their accommodation as well as for their
employment' upon their arrival.</p>
<p>His choice of Port Jackson as the site of the settlement was
approved of, but as by his own account the soil did not appear to
be very fertile, and the numbers and hostility of the natives made
cultivation difficult and dangerous, it was thought that Norfolk
Island would be the most favourable position, and were it not for
the fact of great labour and expense having already been incurred
at Port Jackson, Grenville would have recommended that island being
made the main settlement. Phillip, however, was instructed to
increase the establishment on the island as far as he conveniently
could, and if any similar situation equally advantageous should be
discovered, to detach thither a considerable part of the convicts
who would be sent out in the next ships. 'The <i>Guardian</i> will
have on board about twenty-five convicts who are either artificers
or persons accustomed to agriculture, and also eight or ten
superintendents, who have been engaged in consequence of your
recommendation of the measure; to each of the latter an annual
salary of &pound;40 will be given in addition to the ration of
provisions.'</p>
<p>Captain Cook, it will be remembered, had discovered Norfolk
Island, and its size, by a reference to the chart, could have been
seen by the youngest clerk in the Home Office, and yet in the
opinion of Grenville it was a better place than Port Jackson for
the chief settlement!</p>
<p>But before this despatch arrived many things happened. First,
Phillip, finding that no storeships came in, despatched the
<i>Sirius</i> to the Cape of Good Hope for provisions. She returned
in May 1789, and on the way back she encountered very heavy
weather. Southwell, who was on board, writing to his uncle,
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'I will now say a word or two concerning our passage when coming
from the Cape of Good Hope. When I last wrote to you, having taken
in our cargo, the principal which was six months' full allowance of
flour for the colony and twelve months' provisions for the ship, we
sailed again for New Holland, and had a very narrow escape from
shipwreck, being driven on that part of the coast called Tasman's
Head, in thick weather and hard gales of wind, and embayed, being
twelve hours before we got clear, the ship forced to be overpressed
with sail and the hands kept continually at the pumps, and all this
time in the most distressing anxiety, being uncertain of our exact
situation and doubtful of our tackling holding, which has a very
long time been bad: for had a mast gone or a top-sheet given way,
there was nothing to be expected in such boisterous weather but
certain death on a coast so inhospitable and unknown. And now to
reflect if we had not have reached the port with that seasonable
supply, what could have become of this colony?'</p>
<p>The flour brought by the <i>Sirius</i> was not much, and still
no storeships came. Phillip accordingly determined to reduce the
rations, and on 1st November 1789 a reduction of one-third was
made. This reduction applied to everyone, women excepted, in the
settlement. Says Collins:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The Governor, whose humanity was at all times conspicuous,
directed that no alteration should be made in the ration to be
issued to the women. They were already upon two-thirds of the men's
allowance; and many of them either had children who could very well
have eaten their own and part of the mother's ration, or they had
children at the breast; and although they did not labour, yet their
appetites were never so delicate as to have found the full ration
too much had it been issued to them. The like reduction was
enforced afloat as well as on shore, the ships' companies of the
<i>Sirius</i> and <i>Supply</i> being put to two-thirds of the
allowance usually issued to the King's ships. . . .</p>
<p>'Thus opened the month of November in this settlement; where,
though we had not the accompanying gloom and vapour of our own
climate to render it terrific to our minds, yet we had that before
us, in the midst of all our sunshine, which gave it the complexion
of the true November so inimical to our countrymen.'</p>
<p>These reduced rations were issued, Collins adds, to the convicts
on Saturdays; by the following Tuesday night the greater number of
the recipients had nothing left to allay the pangs of hunger. Their
only resource was persistent thieving from their fellows or the
other members of the settlement. The Governor therefore gave
instructions to issue provisions on Wednesdays as well as
Saturdays. The allowance being thus divided caused even the
improvident to be more able to perform the labour required from
them; and that Phillip, in view of their condition, made that
labour as light as possible, we can have no doubt.</p>
<p>Tench gives us a picture of the settlement at this
time:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Our impatience of news from Europe strongly marked the
commencement of the year. We had now been two years in the country,
and thirty-two months from England, in which long period no
supplies, except what had been procured at the Cape of Good Hope by
the <i>Sirius</i>, had reached us. From intelligence of our friends
and connections we had entirely been cut off, no communication
whatever having passed with our native country since the 13th of
May 1787, the day of our departure from Portsmouth. Famine, beside,
was approaching with gigantic strides, and gloom and dejection
overspread every countenance. Men abandoned themselves to the most
desponding reflections, and adopted the most extravagant
conjectures.</p>
<p>'Still we were on the tip-toe of expectation. If thunder broke
at a distance, or a fowling-piece of louder than ordinary report
resounded in the woods, "a gun from a ship" was echoed on every
side, and nothing but hurry and agitation prevailed. For eighteen
months after we had landed in the country, a party of marines used
to go weekly to Botany Bay to see whether any vessel, ignorant of
our removal to Port Jackson, might be arrived there. But a better
plan was now devised, on the suggestion of Captain Hunter. A party
of seamen was fixed on a high bluff called South Head at the
entrance to the harbour, on which a flag was ordered to be hoisted
whenever a ship might appear, which should serve as a direction to
her, and as a signal of approach to us. Every officer stepped
forward to volunteer a service which promised to be so replete with
beneficial consequences. But the zeal and alacrity of Captain
Hunter and our brethren of the <i>Sirius</i> rendered superfluous
all assistance or co-operation.</p>
<p>'Here on the summit of the hill, every morning from daylight
till the sun sunk, did we sweep the horizon in hope of seeing a
sail. At every fleeting speck which arose from the bosom of the sea
the heart bounded, and the telescope was lifted to the eye. If a
ship appeared here, we knew she must be bound to us: for on the
shores of this vast ocean (the largest in the world) we were the
only community which possessed the art of navigation, and
languished for intercourse with civilised society.</p>
<p>'Vigorous measures were become indispensible. The Governor,
therefore, early in February ordered the <i>Sirius</i> to prepare
for a voyage to China; and a farther retrenchment of our rations,
we were given to understand, would take place on her sailing.</p>
<p>'But the <i>Sirius</i> was destined not to reach China.
Previously to her intended voyage she was ordered, in concert with
the <i>Supply</i>, to convey Major Ross, with a large detachment of
marines, and more than 200 convicts, to Norfolk Island, it being
hoped that such a division of our numbers would increase the means
of subsistance, by diversified exertions. She sailed on the 6th of
March . . . and on the 27th of the same month, the following order
was issued from headquarters: "The expected supply of provisions
not having arrived makes it necessary to reduce the present ration,
and the commissary is directed to issue, from the 1st of April, the
undermentioned allowance to every person in the settlement without
distinction, four pounds of flour, two pounds and a half of salt
pork, and one pound and a half of rice per week."'</p>
<p>The officer in charge of the look-out was, it will be
remembered, young Southwell, and he watched the departure of the
two ships as they sailed out between the Heads. Nothing more was
seen of either of them, he writes, till the 5th April, when at
daybreak he was roused from his slumbers by the look-out man with
the news that a sail was in sight. The ship, as she neared the
land, was judged by him to be the <i>Supply</i>, though he wondered
at her returning so soon. Foreboding an accident, he 'desired the
gunner to notice if the people mustered thick on her decks as she
came in under the headland.'</p>
<p>His misgivings were too well-founded&mdash;the ship was the
<i>Supply</i>, the <i>Sirius</i> had left her bones on Norfolk
Island.</p>

FROM NORFOLK ISLAND&mdash;DESPERATE SITUATION OF THE
COLONY&mdash;THE 'SUPPLY' SAILS FOR BATAVIA&mdash;THE SITUATION ON
NORFOLK ISLAND&mdash;THE LOSS OF THE 'GUARDIAN'&mdash;ARRIVAL OF
THE SECOND FLEET&mdash;THE HORRORS OF THE PASSAGE&mdash;THE THIRD
FLEET.</small></p>
<p>F<small>AMINE</small> was now upon the land. Collins and Tench
both tell in simple but moving words the pitiful story of that
time, the darkest hour in the colony's young life. Tench
writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>'On the 5th of April, news was brought that the flag on the
South Head was hoisted. Less emotion was created by the news than
might be expected. Everyone coldly said to his neighbour, "The
<i>Sirius</i> and <i>Supply</i> are returned from Norfolk
Island."'</p>
<p>To satisfy himself that the news was correct, he went to the
Observatory and looked through the large astronomical telescope at
the flag. He saw it plainly enough, but with sinking heart was at
once convinced that the ship was not from England, for he could see
the solitary figure of the signalman strolling to and fro, unmoved
by what he saw. 'I well knew how different an effect the sight of
strange ships would produce.' Phillip, burning with anxiety, was
ready to go down the harbour, and Tench accompanied him. Half-way
down the harbour, just as they turned a point, they saw a boat
which they knew belonged to the <i>Supply</i> rowing towards them.
As the boats neared each other. Tench saw Captain Ball (of the
<i>Supply</i>) make a motion with his hand which indicated that he
brought a tale of disaster. Turning to the Governor, Tench begged
him to prepare himself for bad news. 'A few minutes changed doubt
into certainty; and to our unspeakable consternation we learned
that the <i>Sirius</i> had been wrecked on Norfolk Island on the
19th of February. Happily, however. Captain Hunter and every other
person belonging to her were saved. Dismay was painted on every
countenance when the tidings were proclaimed in Sydney. The most
distracting apprehensions were entertained, and all hopes were now
concentred in the little <i>Supply</i>.</p>
<p>'When the age of our provisions is recollected, the inadequacy
of our food will more strikingly appear. The pork and rice were
brought with us from England. The pork had been salted between
three and four years, and every grain of rice was a moving body,
from the inhabitants lodged within it! We soon left off boiling the
pork, as it had become so old and dry that it sunk one-half in its
dimensions when dressed. Our usual method of cooking it was to cut
off the daily morsel and toast it on a fork before the fire,
catching the drops which fell on a slice of bread or in a saucer of
rice. Our flour was the remnant of what was brought from the Cape
by the <i>Sirius</i>, and was good. Instead of baking it, the
soldiers and convicts used to boil it up with greens.'</p>
<p>Can anyone nowadays imagine the hideous isolation of the place?
Railways, telegraphs, steamships have made such a complete cutting
off from the world, in these times, a matter of impossibility. Upon
Phillip alone rested the duty of finding food and caring for a
thousand persons, nine hundred of whom, from ignorance and
viciousness, would have died of starvation sooner than have done a
hand's turn to help themselves.</p>
<p>Maxwell, one of the lieutenants of the <i>Sirius</i>, had gone
melancholy mad, was discharged from the ship, and was at this time
wandering about the settlement. Says Collins:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Mr Maxwell, whose disorder at times admitted of his going out
alone, was fortunately brought up from the lower part of the
harbour, where he had passed nearly two days, without sustenance,
in rowing from one side to the other in a small boat by himself. He
was noticed by a sergeant who had been fishing, and who observed
him rowing under the dangerous rocks of the Middle Head, where he
must soon have been dashed to pieces, but for his fortunate
interposition. After this escape he was more narrowly watched.
While occupied in listening to the tale of his distress, the
<i>Supply</i> returned from Norfolk Island with an account that was
of itself almost sufficient to have deranged the strongest
intellect among us. A load of accumulated evils seemed bursting at
once upon our heads. The ships that we expected with supplies were
still to be anxiously looked for; and the <i>Sirius</i>, which was
to have gone in quest of relief to our distresses, was lost upon
the reef at Norfolk Island on the 19th of last month. This was a
blow which, as it was expected, fell with increased weight, and on
everyone the whole weight seemed to have fallen.</p>
<p>'This untoward accident happened in the following manner:
Captain Hunter was extremely fortunate in having a short passage
hence to Norfolk Island, arriving there in seven days after he
sailed. The soldiers and a considerable part of the convicts were
immediately landed in Cascade Bay, which happened at the time to be
the leeward side of the island. Bad weather immediately ensued, and
continuing for several days, the provisions could not be landed, so
high was the surf occasioned by it. This delay, together with a
knowledge that the provisions on the island were not adequate to
the additional numbers that were now to be victualled, caused him'
(Hunter) 'to be particularly anxious to get the provisions on
shore. The bad weather had separated the <i>Sirius</i> from the
<i>Supply</i>; but meeting with a favourable slant of wind on the
19th, Captain Hunter gained the island from which he had been
driven, and stood for Sydney Bay, at the south end of it, where he
found the <i>Supply</i>; and it being signified by signal from the
shore (where they could form the best judgment) that the landing
might be effected by any boat, he brought-to in the windward part
of the bay, with the ship's head off shore, got out the boats, and
loaded them with provisions.' He then describes how the ship began
to drift towards the rocks, and how an endeavour was made to put
her about, when she missed stays, and striking with violence on the
reef, very soon bilged, and was irrecoverably lost. 'Her officers
and people were all saved, having been dragged on shore through the
surf on a grating. This day, which untoward circumstances have
rendered so gloomy to us, was remarkably fine, and at the
unfortunate moment of this calamity there was very little wind. On
the next or second day after, permission was given to two convicts
(one of whom, James Brannegan, was an overseer) to get off to the
ship, and endeavour to bring on shore what live hogs they might be
able to save; but with all that lamentable want of resolution and
consideration which is characteristic of the lower order of people
when temptations are placed before them, they both got intoxicated
with the liquor which had escaped the plunder of the seamen, and
set the ship on fire in two places. A light on board the ship being
observed from the shore, several shot were fired at it, but the
wretches would neither put it out or come on shore; when a young
man of the name of Ascott, a convict, with great intrepidity went
off through the surf, extinguished the fire and forced them out of
the ship.'</p>
<p>For his good service it is satisfactory to know that Ascott was
not forgotten by Phillip, who wrote to England and procured his
pardon.</p>
<p>The disaster to the <i>Sirius</i> again served to show Phillip's
resourcefulness. He assembled his civil and military officers
without delay, and the desperate situation of the colony was
thoroughly considered. It was decided to reduce still further a
ration that was already too low for proper human subsistence. To
fish for a living, instead of being a mere expression, became a
literal fact, for all private boats were to be surrendered for the
general benefit.</p>
<p>The services of the three convicts to whom the duty had been
assigned of shooting kangaroos for individuals were now employed
for the benefit of the community, but although considered good
marksmen, they only succeeded in killing three kangaroos in as many
weeks. A fishery, under the control of one of the midshipmen of the
wrecked <i>Sirius</i>, was established at Botany Bay, but it did
not answer, and was soon abandoned. At the present day Botany Bay
is one of the main sources of the fish supply of the city of
Sydney, but in Phillip's day&mdash;doubtless owing to the want of
proper gear&mdash;the quantity of fish taken was very
inconsiderable, and the labour of transporting it by land from
thence was greater than the advantage which was expected to be
derived from it.</p>
<p>The boats were therefore removed to Sydney, where they were
employed with better success, but the straits of the settlement may
be imagined when it is recorded that an officer had to go in every
boat, night and day, to prevent the fish caught being devoured by
the hungry fishermen. Once four hundredweight of fish were caught,
but generally the united take of the boats was no more than
sufficient to provide the men employed with one pound of fish per
man, which was allowed them in addition to their scanty ration. The
small, privately owned boats were therefore returned to their
owners, and the fishing was conducted in the larger boats belonging
to the settlement, under the direction of some seamen belonging to
the <i>Sirius</i>.</p>
<p>Absolute starvation now stared the community in the face. The
proposed voyage of the <i>Sirius</i> to China for provisions was at
an end, and the long looked for succour from England, though hourly
expected, had not arrived. The necessity of procuring relief became
every day more pressing. The Governor, therefore, determined to
send the <i>Supply</i> to Batavia. Ball, the energetic commander of
this small vessel, was directed to buy a supply of eight months'
provisions for himself, and from the Dutch authorities to hire a
vessel and purchase flour, beef, pork and rice, together with some
necessaries for the hospital. The expectation of this relief was
indeed distant, but yet it was more to be depended upon than that
which might be coming from England. A given time was fixed for the
return of the <i>Supply</i>; but it was impossible to say when a
vessel might arrive from Europe. Whatever might be the distress for
provisions, it would be some alleviation to look on to a certain
fixed date when it might be expected to be removed. Lieutenant
Ball's passage lay through the region of fine weather, and the
hopes of everyone were fixed upon the little vessel which was to
convey him. The <i>Supply</i> sailed from Sydney on the 17th of
April; on board was Lieutenant King, the late commandant of Norfolk
Island, charged with Phillip's despatches for the Secretary of
State. The emotions of the settlers, free and bond, as they saw the
small craft, the last link that bound them to the world beyond,
disappear from their view, may be readily imagined.</p>
<p>Collins narrates that 'the Governor, from a motive that did him
immortal honour in this season of general distress,' gave up three
hundredweight of flour which was his private property, 'declaring
that he wished not to see anything more at his table than the
ration which was received in common from the public store, without
any distinction of persons; and to this resolution he resolutely
adhered, wishing that if a convict complained, he might see that
want was not unfelt even at Government House.'</p>
<p>The ration at 'Government House' and the military and convict
quarters was then, Collins tells us:&mdash;</p>
<p>'To each man for 7 days, or to 7 people for one day: flour,
2&frac12; pounds; rice, 2 pounds; pork, 2 pounds.'</p>
<p>The pease were all expended. Was this a ration for a labouring
man? The two pounds of pork, when boiled, from the length of time
it had been in the store, shrunk away to nothing; and when divided
among seven people for their day's sustenance, barely afforded
three or four morsels each.</p>
<p>'The inevitable consequences of this scarcity of provisions
ensued. Labour stood nearly suspended for want of energy to
proceed; and the countenances of the people plainly bespoke the
hardships they underwent. The convicts, however, were employed for
the public in the afternoons; and such labour was obtained from
them as their situation would allow.'</p>
<p>Meanwhile, what was happening at Norfolk Island? Ross's
opportunity had come to show how <i>he</i> could govern. Possibly
Phillip had sent him to the island to get rid of him. It was time
for someone to carry to the Home Government urgent representations
of the colony's great need, and Phillip had no officer so well
fitted for this service as King. The lieutenant could be trusted to
do his best to procure the much-needed supplies, and at the same
time he was not the man to join forces with the 'opposition', and
recommend that the settlement should be abandoned on the ground
that 'it would not support itself for a hundred years.'</p>
<p>The military, if not the administrative spirit, is shown in what
followed the wreck of the <i>Sirius</i>, King retained command of
the island until he left it in the <i>Supply</i>, and did so at the
request of Ross, yet according to Hunter's <i>Narrative</i>,
immediately after the ship was lost, 'Lieutenant-Governor Ross
ordered the drums to assemble all the mariners and convicts;
martial law was then proclaimed, and the people were told that if
anyone killed any animal or fowl, or committed any robbery
whatever, they would be instantly made a severe example of. The
officers and marines were ordered to wear their field arms; guards
were set over the barn and storehouses, and some other necessary
regulations were ordered by the Lieutenant-Governor.'</p>
<p>It will be seen that Ross, who was unable to sanction his
officers taking part in judicial proceedings at Port Jackson under
Governor Phillip, speedily discovered a means by which a court
could be formed at Norfolk Island under Lieutenant-Governor Ross.
At Port Jackson the marines declared that a general court-martial
could not assemble unless thirteen officers were present, and could
not act then unless under a warrant from the Admiralty. At Norfolk
Island, by proclaiming martial law, Ross conceived that his warrant
for convening a court was sufficient for all purposes. The
condition of affairs at the island when the <i>Sirius</i> went on
shore is, of course, some justification for Ross's 'panic
legislation', although Mr Barton, the ablest Australian historian,
has arrived at an opposite conclusion. Mr Barton quotes authorities
to show that the only justification recognised by English law for
proclaiming martial law 'is necessity, a necessity demonstrated by
facts, not an imaginary one.' But Ross was in the position of a
captain of a ship with his vessel in the breakers, who loads his
revolvers in readiness to shoot the first man who attempts to rush
the boats.</p>
<p>Ross's crew were of a kind very likely to rush the boats, and if
he was a little hasty in getting his revolvers ready, small blame
to him on that account: but it is a pity that when acting under
Phillip he should have shown such extreme regard for red-tape
formalities in the matter of the court-martial.</p>
<p>All this time the people on the mainland are left nearly
starving, and so Norfolk Island must take care of itself as best it
can for a while. No news of it can reach Port Jackson, for the
<i>Sirius</i> is slowly breaking up on the reef, and the
<i>Supply</i> has gone to Batavia for help.</p>
<p>'I early and late look with anxious eyes toward the sea, and at
times, when the day was fast setting and the shadows of the evening
stretched out, have been deceived with some fantastic little cloud,
which, as it has condensed or expanded by such a light, for a
little time has deceived impatient imagination into a momentary
idea that 'twas a vessel altering her sails or position while
steering in for the haven, when in a moment it has assumed a form
so unlike what the mind was intent upon, or become so greatly
extended, as fully to certify me of its flimsy texture and fleeting
existence. Surely our countrymen cannot have altogether forgotten
us, or been vainly led from any silly, sanguine representations
hence, to trust we could make it out tolerably well without their
assistance.'</p>
<p>One can well imagine young Southwell, who thus wrote to his
uncle, straining his eyes seaward from the cliffs at South Head,
and looking in vain for a sail on the solitary Pacific&mdash;the
ocean, for many hundreds of miles further than the range of his
telescope, a desert of water.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, what must have been the feelings of the lonely man
upon whom the welfare of the entire settlement depended&mdash;a
burden no wise lessened by the whinings of his small-souled
subordinates, each preoccupied with his own individual
grievances?</p>
<p>Tench tells how at length the clouds of misfortune began to
separate, and on the evening of the 3rd of June, the joyful cry of
'the flag's up', resounded in every direction.</p>
<p>'I was sitting in my hut, musing on our fate, when a confused
clamour in the street drew my attention. I opened my door, and saw
several women with children in their arms running to and fro with
distracted looks, congratulating each other, and kissing their
infants with the most passionate and extravagant marks of fondness.
I needed no more; but instantly started out, and ran to a hill,
where, by the assistance of a pocket-glass, my hopes were realized.
My next door neighbour, a brother officer, was with me; but we
could not speak; we wrung each other by the hand, with eyes and
hearts overflowing. Finding that the Governor intended to go
immediately in his boat down the harbour, I begged to be of his
party. As we proceeded, the object of our hopes soon
appeared&mdash;a large ship, with English colours flying, working
in between the heads which form the entrance of the harbour. The
tumultuous state of our minds represented her in danger, and we
were in agony. Soon after, the Governor, having ascertained what
she was, left us, and stepped into a fishing boat to return to
Sydney.</p>
<p>'The weather was wet and tempestuous; but the body is delicate
only when the soul is at ease. We pushed through wind and rain, the
anxiety of our sensations every moment redoubling. At last we read
the word "London" on her stern. "Pull away, my lads, she is from
old England; a few strokes more, and we shall be aboard; hurrah for
a belly-full, and news from our friends!" Such were our
exhortations to the boat's crew. A few minutes completed our
wishes, and we found ourselves on board the <i>Lady Juliana</i>
transport, with two hundred and twenty-five of our countrywomen,
whom crime or misfortune had condemned to exile. We learned that
they had been almost eleven months on their passage, having left
Plymouth, into which port they had put, in July 1789. We continued
to ask a thousand questions in a breath. Stimulated by curiosity,
they inquired in turn; but the right of being first answered, we
thought, lay on our side. "Letters! letters!" was the cry. They
were produced, and torn open in trembling agitation. News burst
upon us like meridian splendor on a blind man. We were overwhelmed
with it; public, private, general and particular. Nor was it until
some days had elapsed that we were able to methodize it, or reduce
it into form. We now heard for the first time of our Sovereign's
illness, and his happy restoration to health. The French Revolution
of 1789, with all the attendant circumstances of that wonderful and
unexpected event, succeeded to amaze us. Now, too, the disaster
which had befallen the <i>Guardian</i>' (wrecked on her way out),
'and the liberal and enlarged plan on which she had been stored and
fitted out by Government for our use, was promulged. It served also
in some measure to account why we had not sooner heard from
England.</p>
<p>'For had not the <i>Guardian</i> struck on an island of ice, she
would probably have reached us three months before, and in this
case have prevented the loss of the <i>Sirius</i>, although she'
(the <i>Guardian</i>) 'had sailed from England three months after
the <i>Lady Juliana</i>.'</p>
<p>The loss of this ship was a disaster great enough to merit a
page of description here, but the name of her commander, of whom
Nelson wrote as the 'gallant and good Captain Riou', gives
additional interest to the story of the wreck.</p>
<p>The <i>Guardian</i> was a forty-four gun ship, which had been
selected for the service on account of her fast sailing qualities.
Her guns were taken out, she was specially fitted, and had on board
a great quantity of provisions and stores of all kinds for the
settlement. She sailed from England in September 1789, and on the
23rd of December, after leaving the Cape of Good Hope, she struck
some floating ice, receiving severe damage.</p>
<p>To prevent the vessel sinking, most of the live stock and other
stores were thrown overboard. Riou, after doing what he could to
save the ship, concluded that there was no chance of keeping her
afloat, and so sent most of the people away in the boats, but
himself with a few others remained on board, and after a wonderful
and hazardous voyage lasting nine weeks, succeeded in getting back
to the Cape.</p>
<p>After reaching Cape Town, although badly injured in the
accident, Riou worked like a Trojan to get the ship repaired, but
at last had to give it up. His great concern was for the people in
the little colony, who were, as he fully understood, in sore need
of the stores. Behind the <i>Guardian</i> the other vessels of the
Second Fleet of transports were slowly arriving at the Cape, and
Riou used every exertion to hasten on their departure, putting on
board them what stores he had saved from the wreck.</p>
<p>In a despatch to the Admiralty sent by him on 20th May 1790, he
writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>'By the <i>Lady Juliana</i>, transport, which sailed from this
bay on the 30th of March, I sent seventy-five barrels of flour and
one pipe of Teneriffe wine consigned to Governor Phillip. I had
been so fortunate as to preserve the despatches which I had
received from the hands of Vice-Admiral Roddam for Governor
Phillip, and I delivered them to the care of Lieut. Thomas Edgar,
superintendant of the <i>Lady Juliana</i>, In that ship I also sent
the five surviving superintendants of convicts which were on board
the <i>Guardian</i>.</p>
<p>'The <i>Neptune</i>, <i>Surprize</i>, and <i>Scarborough</i>
arrived in False Bay the 14th of April, and in them I sent, under
the care of Lt. John Shapcote, the agent, twenty convicts, which
were all that remained alive of the twenty-five that were sent on
board the <i>Guardian</i> at Spithead. I also put on board those
ships four hundred tierces of beef and two hundred tierces of pork;
and had not a misunderstanding existed between Lieutenant Shapcote
and myself, it is my opinion I could have sent many articles which
would not have taken up much stowage in the ships under his
direction that would have been very acceptable to His Majesty's
colony in New South Wales. But as that officer waited my orders for
his proceedings, and afterwards persisted in his own resolution of
sailing from False Bay on a certain day which he determinately
fixed upon, I lost no time to endeavour to acquiesce in his
measures, resolving that nothing should be wanting on my part to
give all possible assistance to the colony, fearing that it might
severely experience the effects of the accident that has befel His
Majesty's ship under my command. The <i>Neptune</i>,
<i>Surprize</i>, and <i>Scarborough</i> sailed from False Bay on
the 29th of April.</p>
<p>'Permit me now, sir, to address you on a subject which I hope
their Lordships will not consider to be unworthy their notice. It
is to recommend as much as is in my power to their Lordships'
favour and interest the case of the twenty convicts which my duty
compelled me to send to Port Jackson. But the recollection of past
sufferings reminds me of that time when I found it necessary to
make use of every possible method to encourage the minds of the
people under my command, and at such a time, considering how great
the difference might be between a free man struggling for life, and
him who perhaps might consider death as not much superior to a life
of ignominy and disgrace, I publicly declared that not one of them,
so far as depended on myself, should ever be convicts. And I may
with undeniable truth say that had it not been for their assistance
and support, the <i>Guardian</i> would never have arrived to where
she is. Their conduct prior to the melancholy accident that
happened on the 23rd of December last was always such as may be
commended, and from their first entrance into the ship at Spithead,
they ever assisted and did their duty in like manner as the crew. I
have taken the liberty to recommend them to the notice of Governor
Phillip; but I humbly hope, sir, their Lordships will consider the
service done by these men as meriting their Lordships' favour and
protection, and I make no doubt that should I have been so
fortunate as to represent their cases in proper colours, that they
will experience the benefit of their Lordships' interest.'</p>
<p>The twenty convicts were pardoned upon condition that they
remained in the colony until their sentences expired.</p>
<p>The arrival of the <i>Lady Juliana</i> was not an unmixed
blessing. Collins says that when the women were landed many of them
appeared to be loaded with the infirmities incident to old age, and
to be 'very improper subjects for any of the purposes of an infant
colony. . . . Instead of being capable of labour, they seemed to
require attendance themselves, and were never likely to be any
other than a burden to the settlement, which must sensibly feel the
hardship of having to support by the labour of those who could
toil, and who at the best were but few, a description of people
utterly incapable of using any exertion towards their own
maintenance.'</p>
<p>This ship's arrival was followed a fortnight later by that of
the <i>Justinian</i> with a cargo of provisions, but fortunately no
prisoners to help eat them, and on the day following full rations
were ordered to be issued; the drum for labour was beat as usual at
one o'clock, and hope ran high that the worst was over, and that no
further hardships would have to be endured.</p>
<p>In order to relieve the community on Norfolk Island, whose
situation, says Collins, 'everyone was fearful might call loudly
for relief', it was decided to send the <i>Lady Juliana</i> there
as quickly as possible, and as she was in a bad state of repair,
some carpenters from the shore were sent to sheath her bends, which
were in a very bad state.</p>
<p>Then in quick succession there came into port the remaining
vessels which, with the <i>Guardian</i>, made up the Second Fleet.
These were the <i>Surprize</i>, the <i>Scarborough</i> and the
<i>Neptune</i>, These ships brought with them a detachment of the
newly-formed New South Wales corps&mdash;a gang of gaol-birds and
ruffians raised for the service by Lieutenant-Colonel
Grose&mdash;and the three last-named vessels established for
themselves an infamous notoriety. The three ships brought 1038
persons, of whom 273 died on the passage, 486 were landed sick at
Port Jackson, and 124 died in the hospital at Sydney.</p>
<p>This is what Tench says about them:&mdash;'Seventeen pounds, in
full of all expence, was the sum paid . . . for the passage of each
person. And this sum was certainly competent to afford fair profit
to the merchant who contracted. But there is reason to believe that
some of those who were employed to act for him violated every
principle of justice, and rioted on the spoils of misery, for want
of controlling power to check their enormities. No doubt can be
entertained that a humane and liberal Government will interpose its
authority to prevent the repetition of such flagitious conduct.</p>
<p>'Although the convicts had landed from these ships with every
mark of meagre misery, yet it was soon seen that a want of room, in
which more conveniences might have been stowed for their use, had
not caused it. Several of the masters of the transports immediately
opened stores and exposed large quantities of goods to sale, which,
though at most extortionate prices, were eagerly bought up.'</p>
<p>Phillip felt deeply for the victims of this system. On 13th July
1790 he wrote to Lord Grenville:&mdash;</p>
<p>'I will not, Sir, dwell on the scene of misery which the
hospitals and sick-tents exhibited when those people were landed,
but it would be a want of duty not to say that it was occasioned by
the contractors having crowded too many on board those ships, and
from their being too much confined during the passage. The convicts
having the liberty of the deck depended on the agent and on the
masters of the ships; the agent died on the passage, and the
masters say it was granted so far as was consistent with their own
safety, and that many of the convicts were sick when sent from the
hulks. I believe, Sir, while the masters of the transports think
their own safety depends on admitting few convicts on deck at a
time, and most of them with irons on, which prevent any kind of
exercise, numbers must always perish on so long a voyage, and many
of those now received are in such a situation from old complaints,
and so emaciated from what they have suffered on the voyage, that
they will never be capable of any labour. . . . By the surgeon's
returns of this day there are 488 under medical treatment; when the
ships arrived we had not fifty people sick in the colony.'</p>
<p>The crisis was now over, and the outlook for the little colony
brighter. We can imagine Phillip sleeping sounder o' nights,
forgetting for a time what for many years to come was to be the
most anxious care of the Governor&mdash;the food supply&mdash;and
turning his attention to the progress of 'our public buildings'.
But, alas I the despatches sent by the Second Fleet brought news
that ten more vessels were on their way with convicts. They arrived
between the months of July and December 1791, and out of their
complement of 2061 prisoners, 1863 were landed, the rest having
died on the voyage, and 576 of those landed were ill and incapable
of work for many weeks after debarcation. There is, however, no
need to tell the story of the 'Third Fleet'&mdash;the arrival of
the convict ships for years to come was to be the regular and chief
event in the colony's history.</p>

ROGUES&mdash;A CODE OF REGULATIONS&mdash;TIME-EXPIRED
CONVICTS&mdash;PHILLIP'S POWER OF EMANCIPATION&mdash;ATTEMPTS TO
ESCAPE.</small></p>
<p>I<small>T</small> is, or was until a few years ago, the common
belief in England that Australians were very easily offended by any
reference to the convict times. This is quite a mistake, convict
transportation ceased half a century ago, a man who is an 'old lag'
is as much a curiosity to Australians nowadays as he would be to
Englishmen, and it is quite safe to talk of the subject in any of
the colonies.</p>
<p>The penal establishments undeniably earned for themselves a very
evil reputation, and the novel <i>For the Term of His Natural
Life</i> has done more than anything else to spread abroad and
perpetuate an exaggerated notion of the 'horrors of the system.'
The system was undoubtedly brutal and degrading, but no more brutal
and degrading than the prison administration of the time in
England&mdash;perhaps not so bad.</p>
<p>When Marcus Clarke published his book, naturally enough scores
of imitators followed, and the sufferings of poor,
unjustly-convicted prisoners done to death by heartless gaolers has
ever since formed stock material for writers of 'short
stories.'</p>
<p>Neither writers nor readers troubled themselves about the amount
of truth to be found in these stories, or were concerned with such
details as the time or place of the alleged acts of injustice, and
so no inconsiderable number of otherwise sensible people picture
Governor Phillip as a man who hanged half a dozen convicts every
morning before breakfast, and spent the rest of the day in flogging
prisoners to death.</p>
<p>It is also often asserted that the British Government had no
higher motive in the despatch of the First Fleet than that of
clearing the English gaols, sending shiploads of prisoners to the
other side of the world, depositing them on shore and leaving them
to starve or die, or anything else, so long as the old country was
rid of them.</p>
<p>There is ample evidence to the contrary of this, and Phillip's
instructions, without going any further into the matter, are proof
enough that the Government was really animated by a sincere desire
to convert criminals into colonists. Their mistake was a too great
confidence in the possibility of reform, which gave some ground for
the charge of exiling these people to a far-off country, and
leaving them to starve. It was too much to expect from Phillip that
he could turn a few hundred idle rascals, landed in a desert, into
a self-supporting community in less than half a dozen years.</p>
<p>Some particulars of Phillip's methods of punishing the idle and
vicious, and of rewarding the industrious, will best answer the
charges against his administration, and this chapter of his work,
notwithstanding its hanging and flogging details, provides, in its
account of the state of society at Sydney Cove, some lighter
touches of comedy to relieve the gloom.</p>
<p>Whether it is or ever was right to hang and flog men, although
there are still plenty of people who believe in such punishments,
is no concern of these writers&mdash;but (and this is the point to
be remembered) neither was it any concern of Governor
Phillip's.</p>
<p>There was law in the land then as now, and Phillip's sole duty
was to administer it as he found it. Courts of justice tried
prisoners and sentenced them in Sydney in 1788 to punishments which
a hundred years ago were generally less severe than judges were at
every session passing at the Old Bailey, for in the year of the
colony's foundation about 160 crimes were punishable by the death
penalty, women were whipped through London streets at the
cart-tail, and 500 lashes was a not uncommon punishment for
breaches of discipline in the Army and Navy. It is a fact that a
woman, for the crime of coining, was strangled and afterwards burnt
in public in front of Newgate gaol in the very year that Phillip
landed in Sydney, and about a hundred executions was the annual
average for England at this time. Of course, twelve 'good men and
true' did not in Sydney try their fellow-citizens when they 'got
into trouble', but then the country was at this time a gaol, and
the most sanguine philanthropist has scarcely ventured to argue
that gaol discipline can be maintained by trial by jury.</p>
<p>It is asserted that Phillip was severe&mdash;that granted he
<i>had</i> to flog, he flogged unmercifully. Phillip was a naval
officer, and in the Navy of those days flogging was almost the only
punishment. A century ago such men as Phillip punished with a few
lashes, if sailors, would have either been hanged or flogged round
the fleet, and the number of strokes with the cat would have been
measured by the hundred. A naval officer thus educated in punishing
could scarcely be expected to be gentle in his methods, and if he
showed in the least degree that he had got the better of such a
training, posterity might well deal kindly with his memory.</p>
<p>It is difficult for readers at this end of the century to
realise the shocking character of the English prison system, or
rather utter absence of system, that prevailed until comparatively
recent times. Mrs Fry, the prison reformer, thirty years after the
establishment of Phillip's penal settlement, described the women's
ward in Newgate as such a scene of 'begging, swearing, gaming,
fighting, singing, dancing, dressing up in men's clothes, and such
an awful place as only to be described as hell above ground, and
too dreadful for us to take young persons with us on our
visits.'</p>
<p>Years after Phillip was in his grave, Buxton gave an account of
the prison system in London. He said that after the commitment of a
prisoner was made out, he was handcuffed to a file of perhaps a
dozen wretched persons in a similar situation, and marched through
the streets, sometimes a considerable distance, followed by a crowd
of impudent and insulting gazers, exposed to the stare of every
passenger; the moment he entered prison, irons were hammered on to
him; then he was cast into the midst of a compound of all that was
disgusting and depraved. At night he was locked up in a narrow
cell, with perhaps half a dozen of the worst thieves in London, or
as many vagrants, whose rags were alive, and in actual motion with
filth. He might find himself in bed, and in bodily contact, between
a robber and a murderer; or between a man with a foul disease on
one side, and one with an infectious disorder on the other. He
might spend his days deprived of free air and wholesome exercise.
He might be prohibited from following the handicraft on which the
subsistence of his family depended. He might be half starved for
want of food and clothing and fuel. He might be compelled to mingle
with the vilest of mankind, and, in self-defence, to adopt their
habits, their language and their sentiments; he might become a
villain by actual compulsion. His health might be impaired or
ruined by filth and contagion; and as for his morals, purity itself
could not continue pure, if exposed for any length of time to the
society with which he must associate. His trial might be long
protracted; he might be imprisoned on suspicion, and pine in jail
while his family was starving out of it, without any opportunity of
removing that suspicion, and this for a whole year; if acquitted,
he might be dismissed from jail without a shilling in his pocket,
and without the means of returning home; if convicted, beyond the
sentence awarded by the law, he might be exposed to the most
intolerable hardships, and these might amount to no less than the
destruction of his life now, and his soul for ever.</p>
<p>Contrast this condition of prisoners in London&mdash;many of
them accused persons only&mdash;with the life of convicted felons
in the 'Botany Bay penal settlement', where all that was asked from
the criminal was that he should make a fresh start, work, and
refrain from thieving.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, among the convicts were men so sadly
ignorant, so hideously vicious, so brutally low, that only those
who know the crimes of great cities can picture to themselves what
these criminals were like.</p>
<p>When the lives of all depended on the security of the public
stores, to judge the man who was responsible by the number of
thieves he hanged, or the amount of flogging he ordered them, is
absurd. The true test of the man's character is to be sought, not
in his manner of dealing with the idle and vicious, but in his
treatment of the few who were men enough to deserve sympathy and
encouragement.</p>
<p>In an old churchyard at Campbelltown, about thirty-five miles
from Sydney, there is a tombstone erected to the memory of James
Ruse, who died in 1837. Collins describes him as 'the first settler
in this country, who, when he had been upon his ground for fifteen
months, having got in his crop of corn, declared himself as
relinquishing his claim to any further provisions from the store,
and said that he was able to support himself by the produce of his
farm. He had shown himself an industrious man; and the Governor,
being satisfied that he could do without any further aid from the
stores, consented to his proposal, and informed him that he should
be forthwith put in possession of an allotment of thirty acres of
ground in the situation he then occupied.'</p>
<p>Tench tells us that Ruse, a convict, 'was cast for seven years
at Bodmin assizes in August 1782; he lay five years in prison and
on board the <i>Dunkirk</i> hulk at Plymouth, and then was sent to
this country. When his term of punishment expired in August 1789,
he claimed his freedom, and was permitted by the Governor, on
promising to settle in the country, to take, in December following,
an uncleared piece of ground, with an assurance that if he would
cultivate it, it should not be taken from him. Some assistance was
given him to fell the timber, and he accordingly began.'</p>
<p>The labour of clearing his ground for cultivation was very
arduous, but Ruse was fortunate in having an industrious woman for
his wife; he had married her in the colony. As time went on, the
Governor granted him the labour of one man, but only for a short
time, and then Ruse's wife was his only helper. His greatest check,
he told Tench, was the persistent manner in which his garden was
robbed almost nightly by convicts, in spite of all his
vigilance.</p>
<p>This man was the first successful 'experiment' among the
convicts, and Phillip, one can imagine, signed the first land grant
of thirty acres with a great deal of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Against the industrious Ruse there was a set-off of many
failures, and among the rascals were some whose rogueries were
amusing. For example. Tench tells us of one Daly, who was hanged
for breaking into the public stores, but previous to this crime he
'was the author of a discovery of a gold mine a few months before.
He produced a composition resembling ore mingled with earth, which
he pretended to have brought from it. After a number of attendant
circumstances, too ludicrous and contemptible to relate, which
befel a party who were sent under his guidance to explore this
second Peru, he at last confessed that he had broken up an old pair
of buckles and mixed the pieces with sand and stone; and on
assaying the composition, the brass was detected. The fate of this
fellow I should not deem worth recording did it not lead to the
following observation: that the utmost circumspection is necessary
to prevent imposition in those who give accounts of what they see
in unknown countries. We found the convicts particularly happy in
fertility of invention and exaggerated descriptions. Hence large
fresh water rivers, valuable ores, and quarries of limestone, chalk
and marble were daily proclaimed soon after we had landed. At first
we hearkened with avidity to such accounts; but perpetual
disappointments taught us to listen with caution, and to believe
from demonstration only.'</p>
<p>Captain Tench testifies to the surprising ingenuity of one
prisoner.</p>
<p>'Frazer was an iron manufacturer, bred at Sheffield, of whose
abilities as a workman we have witnessed many proofs. The Governor
had written to England for a set of locks to be sent out for the
security of the public stores, which were to be so constructed as
to be incapable of being picked. On their arrival His Excellency
sent for Frazer, and bade him examine them, telling him at the same
time that they could not be picked. Frazer laughed, and asked for a
crooked nail only to open them all. A nail was brought, and in an
instant he verified his assertion. Astonished at his dexterity, a
gentleman present determined to put it to farther proof. He was
sent for in a hurry, some days after, to the hospital, where a lock
of still superior intricacy and expence to the others had been
provided. He was told that the key was lost, and that the lock must
be immediately picked. He examined it attentively, remarked that it
was the production of a workman, and demanded ten minutes to make
an instrument, and open flew the lock. But it was not only in this
part of his business that he excelled; he executed every branch of
it in superior style. Had not his villainy been still more
notorious than his skill, he would have proved an invaluable
possession to a new country. He had passed through innumerable
scenes in life, and had played many parts. When too lazy to work at
his trade, he had turned thief in fifty different shapes; was a
receiver of stolen goods, a soldier, and a travelling conjurer. He
once confessed to me that he had made a set of tools for a gang of
coiners, every man of whom was hanged.'</p>
<p>Forgers, however, do not seem to have been so successful as the
locksmith, for we learn that 'several convicts brought
recommendatory letters from different friends. Of these some were
genuine, and many owed their birth to the ingenuity of the bearers.
But these last were all such bungling performances as to produce
only instant detection and succeeding contempt. One of them
addressed to the Governor, with the name of Baron Hotham affixed to
it, began "Honored Sir."</p>
<p>Phillip's simple code of regulations for dealing with his people
are worth reprinting, as the first police system in the
colony:&mdash;</p>
<p>'1. A night-watch, consisting of twelve persons, divided into
four parties, is appointed, and fully authorised to patrol at all
hours in the night, and to visit such places as may be deemed
necessary for the discovery of any felony, trespass or
misdemeanour; and for the apprehending and securing for examination
any person or persons that may appear to them concerned therein,
either by entrance into any suspected hut or dwelling, or by such
other manner as may appear expedient.</p>
<p>'2. Those parts in which the convicts reside are to be divided,
and numbered in the following manner: The convicts' huts and the
public farm on the east side of the cove to be the first division.
Those at the brick-kilns and the detached parties at the different
farms in that district the second division. Those on the western
side, as far as the line that separates the district of the women
from the men, the third division. The huts occupied from that line
to the hospital, and from thence to the Observatory, to be the
fourth division.</p>
<p>'3. These districts or divisions each to be of them under the
particular inspection of one person, who shall be judged qualified
to inform himself of the actual residence of each individual in his
district; as well as of his business connections and
acquaintance.</p>
<p>'4. Cognizance is to be taken of such convicts as may sell or
barter their slops or provisions, and also of such as game for
either of the aforesaid articles, and report is to be made of them
to the Judge-Advocate.</p>
<p>'5. Any soldier or seaman found stragling after the taptoo has
beat, or who may be found in the convicts' huts, is to be detained,
and information to be immediately given to the nearest
guardhouse.</p>
<p>'6. On any person's being robbed during the night, he is to give
immediate information thereof to the watch of his district, who, on
the instant of application being made, shall use the most effectual
means to trace out the offender or offenders, so that he or they
may be brought to justice.</p>
<p>'7. The watch of each district is to be under the direction of
one person, who will be named for that purpose, and all the patrols
to be immediately under the inspection of Herbert Keeling. They are
never to receive any fee, gratuity or reward from any individual to
engage their exertions in the execution of the above trust; nor are
they to receive any stipulated encouragement for the conviction of
any offender; but their diligence and good behaviour will be
rewarded by the Governor, and for which purpose their conduct will
be strictly attended to by those who are in authority over
them.</p>
<p>'8. The night-watch to go out as soon as the taptoo has done
beating; to return to their huts when the working-drum beats in the
morning; and reports to be made at twelve o'clock to the
Judge-Advocate, of all robberies and misdemeanours, by Herbert
Keeling. Any assistance the patrols may require will be given them
on applying to the officer of the the nearest guard, and by the
civil power if necessary; for which application is to be made to
the provost-martial.</p>
<p>'9. Any negligence on the part of those who may be employed on
this duty will be punished with the utmost rigor of the law.</p>
<p>'10. The night-watch is to consist of the following [twelve
persons].'</p>
<p>Soon after the inauguration of the colony, the question of what
to do with convicts whose time had expired became a problem. When
Phillip sailed, the Home Office had neglected to supply him with
particulars of the prisoners' sentences, and convicts were
continually asserting that as they had served their time, the
Governor had no further power over them. However, this problem was
settled by the position of the settlement&mdash;its isolation kept
all alike prisoners, and in due course the necessary papers
arrived.</p>
<p>A much more serious difficulty arose out of the legal
interpretation of Phillip's power to emancipate any of his
subjects. He had, before leaving, asked for that power, and the
Government, without passing a special Act of Parliament, could only
grant him authority to pardon persons whose offences were committed
within the colony. The fleet sailed before the Act could be passed,
and it was not until the arrival of the <i>Gorgon</i> late in 1791
that Phillip received the power to emancipate convicts.</p>
<p>He was not, however, the man to shirk responsibility. The need
of power to give men their freedom whose conduct was highly
meritorious was apparent, and the Governor of his own motion
emancipated two men, one of whom, says Collins, had done such
service in the building line that 'there was not a house or
building in the settlement that did not owe something to him.' The
other man was Ascott, who behaved so well when the <i>Sirius</i>
went ashore.</p>
<p>Phillip, in a despatch dated 5th November 1791, says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Of those convicts whose sentences are expired, some who are
seamen or carpenters will be carried away by the transports; but by
far the greatest part of those people must remain, discontented and
desirous of seizing the first opportunity which offers of escaping.
Amongst the many great advantages which would attend settlers
coming out who had some property of their own, their finding
employment for this class of people would be one, for such settlers
would separate them from the convicts, which cannot well be done
while they are employed by the Crown, and probably most of them
would soon be reconciled to remain in the country.</p>
<p>'Of the convicts whose terms of transportation are expired, or
who, from their very meritorious behaviour, have been emancipated,
there is one whose time is expired, and whom, in consideration of
his remaining here a few months longer, I have promised to send
home by the next ships. He is the only carpenter at this place who
is capable of acting as a master carpenter, and while he remains
here I have promised to allow him one shilling per diem.</p>
<p>'The first convict who was emancipated had been bred to surgery,
and merited from his exemplary conduct what has been done for him;
he acts as an assistant to the surgeons, who find him a very useful
man. He is inclined to remain in the country. For him some
allowance will be necessary, and for which he was recommended when
the inconveniences which the superintendents and others laboured
under, from there not being any money in the colony, was
represented to your Lordship.</p>
<p>'The second convict who was emancipated had well earned his
emancipation by his good conduct, and the pains he had taken to
teach others the business of a bricklayer; this man has likewise my
promise to be sent home before I leave the country; and as he
continues to carry on the public works with great diligence, will
expect some little allowance. The time for which he was sentenced
will be expired before he returns to England.</p>
<p>'The third convict was emancipated on the recommendation of the
Lieutenant-Governor, for extinguishing the fire on board the
<i>Sirius</i> after that ship went on shore. This man went to
Calcutta in the <i>Atlantic</i>, and it now appears that his term
of transportation had expired prior to his emancipation.</p>
<p>'One woman has been emancipated on her marrying a
superintendent. The distinction directed to be made with regard to
those convicts who have behaved well before they became settlers
has been attended to; and I hope the necessity there has been of
deviating from the royal instructions respecting settlers will
appear to have been sufficient to justify what I have done on that
head. My letter to Mr Nepean undoubtedly gave little reason to
suppose that many of the marines would be inclined to remain when
the relief took place, and the opinion I formed when that letter
was written was drawn from the great anxiety so many expressed of
quitting a country which was said to be incapable of furnishing
even the common necessaries of life; the people who were to become
settlers were men who had not been in the habit of judging for
themselves, and the fears and apprehensions of some to whom they
had been accustomed to look up with respect, had their effect, and
there was some difficulty in persuading any man on whose judgment
some dependence might be placed to think for himself; but I have
now the pleasure of informing your Lordship that most of those
fears and apprehensions are done away, and that we have now
eighty-six settlers here and at Norfolk Island&mdash;that is,
thirty-one from the marines, eleven seamen, and forty-four from
those convicts whose sentences have expired; there are, likewise,
more marines who have desired to be received as settlers when the
detachment is to be embarked. No man of bad character has been
received as a settler.'</p>
<p>The additional instructions which enabled Phillip to grant these
emancipations enforced the condition that prisoners should not
return to England until the expiration of the time for which they
were sentenced. This was natural enough, considering the anxiety of
the Home Government to settle the new colony. But most of the
time-expired prisoners desired to go back, and Grenville wrote to
Phillip pointing out that such men could not legally be detained,
but that every indulgence should be offered to induce them to
remain. Numbers of them, however, did return, working their
passages home in returning transports, for the Government did not
recognise any obligation on its part to provide them with a return
passage.</p>
<p>Another source of trouble with the prisoners, which, however,
brought with it its own punishment, was their constant attempts to
escape across country. Those who did not get 'bushed' and starved
to death were generally murdered by the natives. Some, after
undergoing dreadful hardships, returned to the settlement. A party
once tried to walk to China. Tench saw them after their
experiences. He says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'When at the hospital I saw and conversed with some of the
Chinese travellers; four of them lay here, wounded by the natives.
I asked these men if they really supposed it possible to reach
China; they answered, that they were certainly made to believe
(they knew not how) that at a considerable distance to the
northward existed a large river, which separated this country from
the back part of China; and that when it should be crossed (which
was practicable) they would find themselves among a copper-coloured
people, who would receive and treat them kindly. They added, that
on the third day of their elopement one of the party died of
fatigue; another they saw butchered by the natives, who, finding
them unarmed, attacked them and put them to flight. This happened
near Broken Bay, which harbour stopped their progress to the
northward, and forced them to turn to the right hand, by which
means they soon after found themselves on the sea shore, where they
wandered about, in a destitute condition, picking up shell-fish to
allay hunger. Deeming the farther prosecution of their scheme
impracticable, several of them agreed to return to Rose Hill, which
with difficulty they accomplished, arriving almost famished. On
their road back they met six fresh adventurers sallying forth to
join them, to whom they related what had passed, and persuaded them
to relinquish their intention. There are at this time not less than
thirty-eight convict men missing, who live in the woods by day, and
at night enter the different farms and plunder for
subsistence.'</p>
<p>There were several attempts to get away by sea, but as there
were nothing but ship's boats to be stolen for the purpose, these
endeavours generally ended in the same way as the China expedition.
There was one noteworthy exception&mdash;that of the escape of
William Bryant and ten others, including his wife and her two young
children, who, in a small boat, succeeded in reaching the island of
Timor, where those who survived were recaptured. This attempt was
no doubt suggested to its daring projectors by the success of
Bligh's boat voyage, the news of which had by this time reached the
settlement, and the voyage of the convicts was not less remarkable
than that of Bligh and his companions.</p>
<p>Tench relates how, in March 1789, sixteen convicts left their
work at the brick-kilns without leave, and marched to Botany Bay
with a design to attack the natives, and to plunder them of their
fishing-tackle and spears. They had armed themselves with their
working tools and large clubs. When they arrived near the bay, 'a
body of Indians', who had probably seen them set out, and had
penetrated their intention from experience, suddenly fell upon
them. 'Our heroes were immediately routed, and separately
endeavoured to effect their escape by any means which were left. In
their flight one was killed, and seven were wounded, for the most
part very severely. Those who had the good fortune to outstrip
their comrades and arrive in camp, first gave the alarm; and a
detachment of marines, under an officer, was ordered to march to
their relief. The officer arrived too late to repel the Indians;
but he brought in the body of the man that was killed, and put an
end to the pursuit. The Governor was justly incensed at what had
happened, and instituted a most rigorous scrutiny into the cause
which had produced it. At first the convicts were unanimous in
affirming that they were quietly picking sweet-tea, when they were,
without provocation, assaulted by the natives, with whom they had
no wish to quarrel. Some of them, however, more irresolute than the
rest, at last disclosed the purpose for which the expedition had
been undertaken; and the whole were ordered to be severely flogged.
Arabanoo was present at the infliction of the punishment, and was
made to comprehend the cause and the necessity of it; but he
displayed on the occasion symptoms of disgust and terror only.'</p>
<p>The blacks looked upon the spectacle of a man being flogged with
feelings which does them honour, for on another occasion Tench
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'But toil cannot be long supported without adequate refreshment.
The first step in every community, which wishes to preserve
honesty, should be to set the people above want. The throes of
hunger will ever prove too powerful for integrity to withstand.
Hence arose a repetition of petty delinquencies, which no vigilance
could detect, and no justice reach. Gardens were plundered;
provisions pilfered; and the Indian corn stolen from the fields,
where it grew for public use. Various were the measures adopted to
check this depredatory spirit. Criminal courts, either from the
tediousness of their process, or from the frequent escape of
culprits from their decision, were seldomer convened than formerly.
The Governor ordered convict-offenders either to be chained
together, or to wear singly a large iron collar, with two spikes
projecting from it, which effectually hindered the party from
concealing it under his shirt; and thus shackled, they were
compelled to perform their quota of work.</p>
<p>'Had their marauding career terminated here, humanity would have
been anxious to plead in their defence; but the natives continued
to complain of being robbed of spears and fishing-tackle. A convict
was at length taken in the act of stealing fishing-tackle from
Daringa, the wife of Colbee (Coleby). The Governor ordered that he
should be severely flogged, in the presence of as many natives as
could be assembled, to whom the cause of punishment should be
explained. Many of them, of both sexes, accordingly attended.
Arabanoo's aversion to a similar sight has been noticed; and if the
behaviour of those now collected be found to correspond with it, it
is, I think, fair to conclude that these people are not of a
sanguinary and implacable temper. Quick indeed of resentment, but
not unforgiving of injury. There was not one of them that did not
testify strong abhorrence of the punishment, and equal sympathy
with the sufferer. The women were particularly affected; Daringa
shed tears; and Barangaroo, kindling into anger, snatched a stick
and menaced the executioner. The conduct of these women on this
occasion was exactly descriptive of their characters. The former
was meek and feminine; the latter fierce and unsubmissive.'</p>
<p>Phillip, before leaving England, wrote a memorandum to the Home
Office in which he outlined his views on the treatment of
prisoners. This document certainly of itself shows that he was no
ardent believer in hanging.</p>
<p>For instance, he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Rewarding and punishing the convicts must be left to the
Governor; he will be answerable for his conduct, and death, I
should think, will never be necessary&mdash;in fact, I doubt if the
fear of death ever prevented a man of no principle from committing
a bad action. There are two crimes that would merit
death&mdash;murder and another. For either of these crimes I would
wish to confine the criminal till the opportunity offered of
delivering him as a prisoner to the natives of New Zealand, and let
them eat him. The dread of this will operate much stronger than the
fear of death.'</p>
<p>The alternative of landing men in New Zealand to be eaten by the
natives is certainly not a very amiable suggestion, but it ought
not to be judged too harshly. A hundred years ago, sailors who had
committed awful crimes which put them outside the pale of nautical
society, were often punished by the masters of their ships
marooning them on some desert island or place supposed to be
inhabited by savages, and Phillip no doubt meant something of this
kind by his proposal.</p>
<p>Collins describes how a desperate rascal was dealt with, and
Phillip's humanity on this occasion is stated by the
historian:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Caesar, being closely attended to, was at length apprehended
and secured. This man was always reputed the hardest working
convict in the country; his frame was muscular and well calculated
for hard labor; but in his intellects he did not very widely differ
from a brute; his appetite was ravenous, for he could in any one
day devour the full ration for two days. To gratify his appetite he
was compelled to steal from others, and all his thefts were
directed to that purpose. He was such a wretch, and so indifferent
about meeting death, that he declared while in confinement that if
he should be hanged he would create a laugh before he was sent off
by playing off some trick upon the executioner. Holding up such a
mere animal as an example was not expected to have the proper or
intended effect; the Governor, therefore, with the humanity that
was always conspicuous in the exercise of the authority vested in
him, directed that he should be sent to Garden Island, there to
work in fetters; and in addition to his ration of provisions he was
to be supplied with vegetables from the garden.'</p>
<p>Phillip, writing to Grenville in July 1790, says, in
illustration of the class of men he had to deal with:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Experience, Sir, has taught me how difficult it is to make men
industrious who have passed their lives in habits of vice and
indolence. In some cases it has been found impossible; neither
kindness nor severity have had any effect; and tho' I can say that
the convicts in general behave well, there are many who dread
punishment less than they fear labour; and those who have not been
brought up to hard work, which are by far the greatest part, bear
it badly. They shrink from it the moment the eye of the overseer is
turned from them.'</p>
<p>With such men in such a situation it was not wonderful that
recourse was frequently had to what were practically the only
punishments of that time&mdash;the gallows and the triangles.</p>

<p class="negindent1"><small>PROGRESS OF THE
SETTLEMENT&mdash;TENCH'S ACCOUNT&mdash;ROSE HILL&mdash;LAND FOR
CONVICT SETTLERS&mdash;TOTAL POPULATION&mdash;HUNTER'S VOYAGE
HOME&mdash;AFFAIRS ON NORFOLK ISLAND&mdash;KING'S VOYAGE
HOME&mdash;PHILLIP'S LAST LONG DESPATCH FROM SYDNEY.</small></p>
<p>P<small>HILLIP'S</small> governorship is drawing to a close.
How, after four years of his rule, is the little community
progressing? Besides finding food for the people, has anything else
been done? Are the felons yet showing signs of becoming industrious
colonists?</p>
<p>Tench, in December 1791, went to the settlement at Rose Hill
with the intention of answering for himself these very important
questions. This is what he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Public buildings here have not greatly multiplied since my last
survey. The storehouse and barrack have been long completed; also
apartments for the chaplain of the regiment and for the
Judge-Advocate, in which last criminal courts, when necessary, are
held; but these are petty erections. In a colony which contains
only a few hundred hovels, built of twigs and mud, we feel
consequential enough already to talk of a treasury, an admiralty, a
public library, and many other similar edifices, which are to form
part of a magnificent square. The great road from near the
landing-place to the Governor's house is finished, and a very noble
one it is, being of great breadth, and a mile long, in a strait
line. In many places it is carried over gullies of considerable
depth, which have been filled up with trunks of trees, covered with
earth. All the sawyers, carpenters and blacksmiths will be soon
concentred under the direction of a very adequate person of the
Governor's household. This plan is already so far advanced as to
contain nine covered sawpits, which change of weather cannot
disturb the operations of, an excellent work-shed for the
carpenters, and a large new shop for the blacksmiths; it certainly
promises to be of great public benefit. A new hospital has been
talked of for the last two years, but is not yet begun.'</p>
<p>There were, however, temporary quarters for the sick&mdash;two
long wooden sheds, with accommodation for 200 patients; at the time
of Tench's visit the sick list contained 382 names; dysentery was
very prevalent, and many cases terminated fatally. The appearance
of the land about Rose Hill did not impress Tench very
favourably.</p>
<p>'The corn,' he says, 'looks miserably. . . . At the bottom of
the garden, which certainly in beauty of form and situation is
unrivalled in New South Wales, are 8000 vines planted, all of which
in another season are expected to bear grapes. Besides the vines
are several small fruit trees, which were brought in the
<i>Gorgon</i> from the Cape, and look lively; on one of them are
half a dozen apples as big as nutmegs.</p>
<p>'. . . My next visit was to the cattle, which consists of two
stallions, six mares and two colts; besides sixteen cows, two
cow-calfs, and one bull-calf, which were brought out by the
<i>Gorgon</i>. Two bulls which were on board died on the passage;
so that on the young gentleman just mentioned depends the stocking
of the colony. The period of the inhabitants of New South Wales
being supplied with animal food of their own raising is too remote
for a prudent man to calculate. The cattle look in good condition,
and I was surprized to hear that neither corn nor fodder is given
to them. . . .</p>
<p>'Divine service is now performed here every Sunday, either by
the chaplain of the settlement, or the chaplain of the regiment. I
went to church to-day. Several hundred convicts were present, the
majority of whom, I thought, looked the most miserable beings in
the shape of humanity I ever beheld; they appeared to be worn down
with fatigue.'</p>
<p>The farming operations at Rose Hill and around it were conducted
by 500 convicts under the supervision of a man of experience. These
men were housed in huts, to every one of which two men were
appointed as watchmen, to prevent them from being robbed of the
rations stored therein. Work began in the summer months at 5
o'clock in the morning, at 10 a.m. four hours' rest was given, at 2
p.m. work was continued till sunset. After finishing his inspection
of the farms about Rose Hill, Tench crossed the country to Prospect
Hill, and visited those belonging to thirteen convicts who had been
given allotments of land by the Governor.</p>
<p>'The terms of which these allotments have been granted are: That
the estates shall be fully ceded for ever to all who shall continue
to cultivate for five years, or more. That they shall be free of
all taxes for the first ten years; but after that period, to pay an
annual quit-rent of one shilling. The penalty on non-performance of
any of these articles is forfeiture of the estate, and all the
labour which may have been bestowed upon it. These people are to
receive provisions (the same quantity as the working convicts),
clothes and medicinal assistance for eighteen months from the day
on which they settled. To clear and cultivate the land, a hatchet,
a tomahawk, two hoes, a spade and a shovel are given to each
person, whether man or woman; and a certain number of cross-cut
saws among the whole. To stock their farms, two sow pigs were
promised to each settler; but they almost all say they have not yet
received any, of which they complain loudly. They all received
grain to sow and plant for the first year. They settled here in
July and August last. Most of them were obliged to build their own
houses; and wretched hovels three-fourths of them are. Should any
of them fall sick, the rest are bound to assist the sick person two
days in a month, provided the sickness lasts not longer than two
months; four days' labour in each year from every person being all
that he is entitled to. To give protection to this settlement, a
corporal and two soldiers are encamped in the centre of the farms,
as the natives once attacked the settlers, and burnt one of their
houses. These guards are, however, inevitably at such a distance
from some of the farms as to be unable to afford them any
assistance in case of another attack.</p>
<p>'With all these people I conversed, and inspected their labours;
some I found tranquil and determined to persevere, provided
encouragement should be given; others were in a state of
despondency, and predicted that they should starve unless the
period of 18 months during which they are to be clothed and fed
should be extended to three years. Their cultivation is yet in its
infancy, and therefore opinions should not be hastily formed of
what it may arrive at with moderate skill and industry. They have
at present little in the ground besides maize, and that looks not
very promising. Some small patches of wheat which I saw are
miserable indeed. The greatest part of the land I think but
indifferent, being light and stony. Of the 13 farms 10 are
unprovided with water; and at some of them they are obliged to
fetch this necessary article from the distance of a mile and a
half. All the settlers complain sadly of being frequently robbed by
the runaway convicts, who plunder them incessantly.'</p>
<p>Tench says that Ruse's farm was given to him by the Governor on
these conditions: 'The place was to be called Experiment Farm; the
said lot to be holden free of all taxes, quit-rents, etc., for ten
years, provided that the occupier, his heirs or assigns shall
reside within the same, and proceed to the improvement thereof;
reserving, however, for the use of the Crown all timber now
growing, or which hereafter shall grow, fit for naval purposes; at
the expiration of ten years, an annual quit-rent of one shilling
shall be paid by the occupier in acknowledgment. Ruse now lives in
a comfortable brick house built for him by the Governor. He has
eleven acres and a half in cultivation, and several more which have
been cleared by convicts in their leisure hours, on condition of
receiving the first year's crop. He means to cultivate little
besides maize; wheat is so much less productive. Of the culture of
vineyards and tobacco he is ignorant; and with great good sense he
declared that he would not quit the path he knew for an
uncertainty. His live stock consists of four breeding sows, and
thirty fowls.'</p>
<p>'Of my Sydney journal, I find no part sufficiently interesting
to be worth extraction. This place had long been considered only as
a depot for stores; it exhibited nothing but a few old scattered
huts and some sterile gardens; cultivation of the ground was
abandoned, and all our strength transferred to Rose Hill. Sydney,
nevertheless, continued to be the place of the Governor's
residence, and consequently the headquarters of the colony. No
public building of note, except a storehouse, had been erected
since my last statement. The barracks, so long talked of, so long
promised, for the accommodation and discipline of the troops were
not even begun when I left the country; and instead of a new
hospital, the old one was patched up, and with the assistance of
one brought ready framed from England, served to contain the sick.
The employment of the male convicts here, as at Rose Hill, was the
public labour. Of the women, the majority were compelled to make
shirts, trowsers and other necessary parts of dress, for the men,
from materials delivered to them from the stores, into which they
returned every Saturday night the produce of their labour, a
stipulated weekly task being assigned to them. In a more early
stage. Government sent out all articles of cloathing ready made;
but by adopting the present judicious plan not only a public saving
is effected, but employment of a suitable nature created for those
who would otherwise consume leisure in idle pursuits only.'</p>
<p>The total number of persons of all descriptions in New South
Wales and its dependency, Norfolk Island, on the 26th of November
1791, was, adds Tench, 4059. They were distributed as follows: at
Sydney, 1259; at Rose Hill, 1628; at Norfolk Island, 1172.</p>
<p>By the ships of the Second and Third Fleets there arrived 'The
New South Wales Corps', a regiment of infantry raised in England to
do duty in the settlement in place of the marines, whose commanding
officer. Major Ross, it will be remembered, was left at Norfolk
Island by the <i>Sirius</i>.</p>
<p>The Major shall, in the following letter to Grenville, dated
29th August 1790, himself tell us how he fared at the
island:&mdash;</p>
<p>'I think I may venture to say that if Providence had not worked
a miracle in our favour, there would have been but few of us found
alive when those ships [the <i>Justinian</i> and the
<i>Surprize</i>] arrived to our relief. And further, I think I may
venture to assure you, and the rest of His Majesty's ministers,
that, with respect to clearing and cultivating land on this island,
I have established such a plan which, if pursued, will render it
unnecessary ever to send any flour here. On the contrary, in one
year from the first of next January, the island will be able to
spare grain for exportation, provided there is not more than seven
hundred people kept upon the island.</p>
<p>'On the 8th instant, a man arrived from Port Jackson for the
purpose of dressing and managing the flax-plant; he has began to
clear ground and prepare the plant for the purpose of dressing. I
am likewise, by the Governor's directions, cutting down some of the
pine-tree spars, in order to be put on board the <i>Gorgon</i>, in
order to their being brought to Europe for the purpose of
experiments. And as I understand that we are to be embarked for a
passage to England on board the <i>Gorgon</i>. I shall wait until I
have the honour of explaining many matters which very much concern
the territory at large, and this island in particular, all which
matters, together with the whole of my conduct since my appointment
as Lieutenant-Governor, I trust will be honored with approval of
His majesty's ministers. And until that happy and much-to-be-wished
period arrives, I have to request that whatever (perhaps false)
representations with respect to my conduct may have appear'd before
the ministers, that you and them may do me the justice and the
honour to suspend passing any judgment upon it until it is
investigated.'</p>
<p>The <i>Supply</i> meanwhile returned from Batavia after an
absence of six months, and was then sent to Norfolk Island to fetch
back Hunter and the crew of the <i>Sirius</i>. A Dutch snow had
been engaged by the <i>Supply</i> at Batavia to bring provisions
for the colony, and on her arrival (at Sydney) she was fitted as a
transport to convey the people of the <i>Sirius</i> to England. She
was miserably small for the purpose&mdash;less than 300
tons&mdash;and occupied thirteen months on the voyage, calling at
Batavia and the Cape on the way. Those who sailed in her were much
annoyed with Phillip for employing this vessel for such a purpose,
and they had reason to be, for the voyage home was one of terrible
hardship, but the Governor at the time had no other ship available.
Hunter, on his return, wrote to the Admiralty pointing out what
shipmasters know well enough nowadays, viz., that the proper route
home from Australia is not round the Cape of Good Hope, or
northward <i>via</i> Batavia, but round Cape Horn. The passenger of
to-day has to thank his stars for the Suez Canal, if he is unable
to fully appreciate the wisdom of Hunter's opinion.</p>
<p>The people of the <i>Sirius</i> had been on Norfolk Island for
eleven months when they were thus relieved. Mrs Macarthur, in a
private letter home, thus describes how the little settlement fared
during this time:&mdash;</p>
<p>'On the 21st of January the <i>Supply</i> was sent to Norfolk
Island to bring hither the <i>Sirius</i> ship's company, and learn
the state of affairs at that place. She returned on the 25th of
February with the officers and men in health, and brought a good
account of the health of every individual left behind. This
circumstance removed some considerable anxiety from our minds, but
it proved our fears had been but too well grounded, and when the
<i>Supply</i> arrived they had not more than ten days' provisions
in the store at full allowance, and from the 14th of last May till
the 18th of July they were reduced to the scanty pittance of three
pounds of flour and one pound and a half of beef per week.</p>
<p>'At this time a most merciful relief came to their assistance.
It had been observed on a high hill in the island (which they have
named Mount Pitt) that many sea-birds frequented it. An endeavour
was made to take some of them, which was successful; and by
attending more particularly to the time of their appearance, and
their favourite haunts, they were discovered in the greatest
abundance. It was the season in which they laid their eggs, and
both birds and eggs were taken in such incredible quantities as
occasioned the small allowance of meat they had issued before to be
stopped; and, however wonderful it may appear to you, yet true it
is, that those birds for many weeks were the chief subsistence of
seven hundred men, and they were so easily taken that after sunset
it was impossible to walk on the mount without treading on them,
and sometimes towards evening they have been observed hovering in
the air in such innumerable flocks as considerably to exclude the
light from the admiring spectators; but now the melancholy truth of
their visible decrease became more and more apparent. Their flights
were directed to other quarters, and at length few remained; but
before hope was quite extinguished, a ship appeared and brought
them a long-expected supply.'</p>
<p>Lieutenant King, it will be remembered, had been sent home with
despatches in April 1790. His voyage of eight months from Batavia
to England, like Hunter's, was one of such danger and distress as
can scarcely be realised nowadays. The little Dutch vessel in which
he sailed had not been five days at sea before her captain and most
of the crew were taken ill with fever. King took charge, and with
the only four able-bodied men navigated the snow to the Mauritius.
Here he embarked a fresh crew and continued his voyage, calling at
the Cape of Good Hope, where he met Riou trying to patch up the
wreck of the <i>Guardian</i>, He sailed again for England, arrived
there in December, and had interviews with Lord Chatham and Lord
Grenville.</p>
<p>Phillip's letters home had acquainted the Government with King's
value, and a commission was already waiting for him as
Lieutenant-Governor of the settlement at Norfolk Island. While at
home he married, embarking with his wife on the <i>Gorgon</i>, and,
reaching New South Wales in September 1791, he returned in a few
weeks to his island command, where certain of his acts gave great
offence to Grose, Phillip's successor. King in these disputes
always shows to advantage, and his superiors in England approved of
most of what Grose censured. The best proof of their confidence in
King is that in 1800 he was appointed Governor of New South
Wales.</p>
<p>Phillip's last long despatch, in which he gave details of the
settlement's progress, was dated 2d October 1792, and was addressed
to Dundas. Some extracts from this will prove that the food supply
was still his chief anxiety:&mdash;</p>
<p>'With respect to those articles of which the colony stands so
much in need, I beg leave to observe that all those wants that have
been pointed out in my different letters from time to time still
exist, or with very few exceptions; and for iron pots in
particular, however trifling the article, we have been nearly as
much distressed as for provisions; cross-cut saws, axes, and the
various tools for husbandry are also much wanted. Many of those
articles are now made here, but the demand for them is greater than
can be supplied, as most of what have been received from England
are worn out.'</p>
<p>The clothing recently sent out by the <i>Britannia</i> he
complains of as being unsuited for men working in the woods; much
of it, too, was so much injured by damp that it would not well
stand a second washing. He proceeds as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>'You will. Sir, naturally suppose that I anxiously look for the
arrival of those ships by which we expect a further supply of
provisions, and I am very sorry to be under the necessity of
adverting to the observation I have so often made, that the colony,
having been almost constantly on a reduced ration, is a great check
on the public labour, as well as the cause of many very unpleasant
circumstances. . . . When the <i>Atlantic</i> arrived from Bengal,
this settlement had only thirteen days' flour and forty-five days'
maize in store at the ration then issued, which was one pound and a
half of flour and four pounds of maize per man for seven days. And
when the <i>Britannia</i> arrived, we had only salt provisions for
fifty-three days at the then ration, which was only two pounds of
pork per man for seven days.</p>
<p>'The arrival of the above ships put it in my power to increase
the ration, and which, though at present little inferior to the
full ration, is, from the nature of some articles and the
deficiency of others, very far from being satisfactory; nor can the
present ration be continued many days longer if the Kitty does not
arrive. . . . My letters by the <i>Supply</i>, <i>Gorgon</i> and
<i>Pitt</i> will have shown that I look to England for the
necessary supplies of which we still stand in great need, and which
I doubt not are now on their passage; but the great length of time
in which this colony has remained in its present state takes away
hope from many, and the consequences must be obvious. It has. Sir,
been my fate to point out wants from year to year; it has been a
duty the severest I have ever experienced. Did those wants only
respect myself or a few individuals I should be silent; but here
are numbers who bear them badly; nor has the colony suffered more
from wanting what we have not received than from the supplies we
have received not arriving in time.'</p>
<p>In this letter, too, he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'You have. Sir, observed in your letter that "the Admiralty had
not determined on replacing the <i>Sirius</i>, but that that
circumstance would not occasion any decrease of the pecuniary
emoluments with which I understood my situation was to be
attended." I beg leave to say that the opinion I gave as to the
necessity of employing King's ships on this station&mdash;that is,
as I explained in my letters, ships having the officers requisite
for keeping a proper discipline on board, and deterring the
convicts from making any attempt to escape by seizing on the
ship&mdash;did not proceed from any view of pecuniary advantage to
myself, and to which I never adverted. That object never drew my
attention, and the advantages I derived from the
<i>Sirius</i>&mdash;<i>a captain's pay for a sixth
rate</i>&mdash;being by the royal instructions of the twenty-fifth
day of April, 1787, directed to be continued, although there should
not be any of His Majesty's ships employed on this station,
rendered it totally unnecessary for me to wish for a King's ship
under any other idea but the one pointed out in my letters. As that
proposition does not appear to meet their Lordships' ideas, I have
prepared for the safety of such ships as may be employed here, as
far as depends on me, by sending to Norfolk Island those whom it
might be presumed would be the ringleaders, should the seizing of
any transport be ever determined on.'</p>
<p>At the conclusion of this letter he tells Dundas that the
commander of the <i>Pitt</i> transport had sold four thousand
pounds' worth of stores brought out as a private venture to the
settlement. Much of this sum was for articles bought by the
Commissary for the use of the convicts. This fact, said Phillip,
would serve to indicate 'what might be brought by a ship loaded
wholly on the account of Government.' He did not, he added, wish to
reflect on the master of the <i>Pitt</i>, but felt obliged to point
out this circumstance in order that a similar evil might not occur
again.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>
<p class="negindent1"><small>SOCIETY IN BOTANY BAY&mdash;THE KING'S
BIRTHDAY&mdash;BARRINGTON, THE CONVICT&mdash;THE REV. RICHARD
JOHNSON&mdash;WILBERFORCE'S LETTER&mdash;ADDRESS TO THE
KING.</small></p>
<p>I<small>N</small> the early days of the settlement, contemporary
chroniclers relate a few incidents showing that all was not dull
routine. There were occasionally little social entertainments which
helped to make the hideous prison atmosphere more endurable, and in
spite of the peculiar character of most of the first colonists, and
the ever-present dread of starvation, the officials and even the
prisoners sometimes kept holiday.</p>
<p>For example, on the King's birthday, 1789, the first play acted
in the colony was staged. Tench reports the performance in these
words:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The anniversary of His Majesty's birthday was celebrated, as
heretofore, at the Government House with loyal festivity. In the
evening, the play of <i>The Recruiting Officer</i> was performed by
a party of convicts, and honoured by the presence of His Excellency
and the officers of the garrison. That every opportunity of escape
from the dreariness and dejection of our situation should be
eagerly embraced, will not be wondered at. The exhilarating effect
of a splendid theatre is well known; and I am not ashamed to
confess that the proper distribution of three or four yards of
stained paper, and a dozen farthing candles stuck around the mud
walls of a convict hut, failed not to diffuse general complacency
on the countenances of sixty persons, of various descriptions, who
were assembled to applaud the representation. Some of the actors
acquitted themselves with great spirit, and received the praises of
the audience; a prologue and an epilogue, written by one of the
performers, were also spoken on the occasion; which, although not
worth inserting here, contained some tolerable allusions to the
situation of the parties, and the novelty of a stage-representation
in New South Wales.'</p>
<p>The same writer, when describing his first sight of the French
vessels under La P&eacute;rouse, conveys to the reader's mind in a
few words how remote was the new country from civilisation. The
announcement of a ship in sight was one that required him who made
it to be a man of 'great veracity'. Writes Tench:&mdash;</p>
<p>'But judge of my surprise on hearing from a sergeant, who ran
down almost breathless to the cabin where I was dressing, that a
ship was seen off the Harbour's mouth. At first I only laughed, but
knowing the man who spoke to me to be of great veracity, and
hearing him repeat his information, I flew on deck, on which I had
barely set my feet when the cry of "another sail" struck on my
astonished ears. Confounded by a thousand ideas which arose in my
mind in an instant, I sprang upon the barricado, and plainly
descried two ships of considerable size standing in for the mouth
of the bay. By this time the alarm had become general, and everyone
appeared lost in conjecture. Now they were Dutchmen sent to
dispossess us, and, the moment after, storeships from England with
supplies for the settlement. It was by Governor Phillip that this
mystery was at length unravelled, and the cause of the alarm
pronounced to be two French ships, which, it was now recollected,
were on a voyage of discovery in the Southern Hemisphere.'</p>
<p>There is now probably no hour in the twenty-four when a vessel
is not passing over the same spot as that where the Frenchmen were
sighted.</p>
<p>Among the notorious prisoners who arrived in Phillip's time was
Barrington, the pickpocket&mdash;a sort of Brummel in his
profession. Tench writes of him thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>'But before I bade adieu to Rose Hill, in all probability for
the last time of my life, it struck me that there yet remained one
object of consideration not to be slighted. Barrington had been in
the settlement between two and three months, and I had not seen
him. I saw him with curiosity. He is tall, approaching to six feet,
slender, and his gait and manner bespeak liveliness and activity.
Of that elegance and fashion, with which my imagination had decked
him (I know not why), I could distinguish no trace. Great allowance
should, however, be made for depression, and unavoidable deficiency
of dress. His face is thoughtful and intelligent; to a strong cast
of countenance, he adds a penetrating eye and a prominent forehead;
his whole demeanour is humble, not servile. Both on his passage
from England and since his arrival here, his conduct has been
irreproachable. He is appointed high-constable of the settlement of
Rose Hill, a post of some respectability, and certainly one of
importance to those who live here. His knowledge of men,
particularly of that part of them into whose morals, manners and
behaviour he is ordered especially to inspect, eminently fit him
for the office. I cannot quit him without bearing my testimony,
that his talents promise to be directed, in future, to make
reparation to society for the offences he has heretofore committed
against it.'</p>
<p>And King, in one of his letters, says that 'the convicts on
board the different ships behaved extremely well, and Mr Barrington
is now a religious convert. He performs service, and gives a sermon
twice on Sundays.'</p>
<p>Religion was not altogether absent from the settlement, although
the British Government did not trouble itself to provide a very
elaborate clerical establishment. The only provision of this kind
was the appointment, at the last moment before the fleet sailed, of
the Rev. Richard Johnson, who according to one authority was 'one
of the people called Methodists.'</p>
<p>Phillip, King and Hunter all speak well of the disinterestedness
of the man, and the good done by him in the face of the greatest
difficulties, and Johnson testifies to the help and encouragement
always given him by Phillip, who made him a magistrate of the
colony. Grose, Phillip's immediate successor, quarrelled with the
parson, and there was afterwards much friction between the two. He
was not paid handsomely&mdash;&pound;182 was allowed him by the
Government&mdash;and for five years after landing he was without a
church. Early in 1791 Phillip began the erection of a place of
worship, but before it was finished the exigencies of the colony,
as we shall hear, required its conversion into a jail, and
subsequently into a granary, so that the services were generally
performed in the open air, or in 'an old boathouse close by the
waterside, not fit for a stable.'</p>
<p>Poor Johnson thus wrote to Phillip, in March 1792, detailing his
grievances:&mdash;</p>
<p>'As to my habitation I am very well satisfied; it is pretty
commodious and convenient&mdash;few better provided for in this
respect in the colony than myself. My principal family complaint
is, that I cannot better provide for them. We are now eight in
number. . . . Our allowance . . . is scanty, and is likely to be
still less. 'Tis seldom we get a fresh meal, and then in general it
is at a dear rate. Fresh pork, one shilling per pound; a moderate
size fowl, three, four or five shillings, and sometimes more.
Indian corn, ten shillings per bushel. Everything else, whether
from on ship or on shore, in the same proportion. Have frequently
asked to have the privilege of a man to shoot for me now and then;
this favour I never have been granted.'</p>
<p>Phillip did his best to help him, but that best was not much.
When the <i>Lady Juliana</i> storeship arrived in June 1790, the
Governor told Johnson that 400 acres were to be surveyed as Church
ground, and this promise was fulfilled, but he could spare no
labour even to clear the ground. Surely, writes the unfortunate
Methodist, the Government did not mean him to use axe and spade
himself? Nevertheless, being a man of energy he did make the
attempt, and by continuous toil managed to better his position
somewhat. 'The sound of four hundred acres,' he says plaintively,
'will appear great. But what. Sir, are four hundred or four
thousand acres full of large green trees, unless some convicts be
allowed to cultivate it?</p>
<p>'I did not come out here as an overseer or as a farmer. I have
other things more, much more important, to attend to. My duty as a
clergyman fully takes up all my time. Neither will my constitution
admit of it&mdash;this is much impaired since I came into this
country, and at this very time I feel such rheumatic pains and
weakness that I can scarcely go through the duties of my office.
This brings me to mention another circumstance. I have to perform
divine service at three different places, vizt., at Sydney,
Parramatta, and at a settlement about three miles to the westward
of Parramatta, and at never a one of these three places is there to
this day any place of worship erected, nor so much as talked of.
The last time I preached at Sydney was in the open air. On the 11th
instant we could not have service at all, because of the rain. . .
. By the grace of God, however, I am resolved to go on in the
discharge of my duty till I can hold out no longer, and then I must
give up and leave this miserable people to spend their Sabbaths in
a manner wholly like heathens.</p>
<p>'Last spring there was a foundation of a church laid at
Parramatta; before it was finished it was converted into a jail or
a lock-up house, and now it is converted into a granary. Have had
this place to perform divine service in for several Sundays; but
now am again turned out, and must again turn field-preacher there
also. I go up to Parramatta as usual once a fortnight&mdash;the
distance by water about fourteen miles. Generally go up on the
Saturday&mdash;sometimes four, five, six hours upon the water. On
Sunday morning early I now ride up to the new settlement; preach in
the open air about seven o'clock to about 600 convicts; at ten and
at four in the afternoon I preach at Parramatta. I fear, however, I
shall not be able to continue this much longer, especially as the
winter is now approaching, unless some places be erected for the
purpose. Besides my public duty I have to visit the sick, which at
present both at Sydney and Parramatta are a great many; numbers
dying every day. Last month above sixty died, and I fear before
this expires there will be again near the same number.'</p>
<p>It was no wonder that in such circumstances Phillip was
compelled to issue an order that convicts who neglected to attend
public worship without good reason would be punished by having part
of their flour ration stopped. When the first church was built,
Johnson himself worked upon it, and its cost was paid by him.</p>
<p>The chaplain wrote asking to be reimbursed for his outlay, and
Grose not only refused to support the application, but did all he
could to obstruct the clergyman. To such an extent was this carried
that King, in a letter to the Home Department, written when Johnson
resigned, said he (Johnson) 'had met with much persecution from
Grose when he commanded here.'</p>
<p>William Wilberforce had a high opinion of the chaplain at Botany
Bay. In 1794 he wrote to Dundas, who was then at the head of the
Home Office, a letter which not only concerns Johnson, but, as the
following extract proves, shows there were people in the old
country then who were beginning to take an interest in the young
colonials:&mdash;</p>
<p>'As it may be longer than I expected before I have the pleasure
of seeing you, and in the interim Captain Hunter may have sailed, I
take up my pen, meaning to detain you as little as I can on the
subject of New South Wales. Mr Johnson, the chaplain, has
transmitted to me the copy of a letter you must have received from
him, wishing me to mediate with you for its favourable reception.
However, when I tell you he is one of the worthiest men breathing,
the most active, the most humble, and at the same time very little
acquainted with the world, I have said enough to excuse the steps
he has taken, and to obtain his reimbursement. In truth, &pound;67
for a church is rather a more moderate charge than Government, I
believe, is used to, and I know from his private letters that he
worked very hard with his own hands, and often by night as well as
day. In my last letter, I mentioned to you that I had been informed
a sufficient number of tolerably qualified instructors for the
children, both of the convicts and the natives, might be found on
the spot; but it occurred to me that it would be highly desirable
to send over some person to act as a general superintendent of all
the schools which should be instituted.. . . I must add, and will
then have done, that the expense of settling schools. Governor
Hunter being directed accordingly, both for natives and Europeans,
and of establishing a superintendent, will, if you approve of it,
be very trifling, compared with the advantages which may
follow&mdash;even the pecuniary advantages: for the more decently
and orderly the colony will be maintained.'</p>
<p>According to Joseph Holt, the Irish rebel who arrived in the
colony, a prisoner, in 1800, Johnson's position was then greatly
improved. Holt, in his <i>Memoirs</i>, says that in the same year
as he arrived, the worthy clergyman returned to England, having
acquired a large fortune before leaving by selling his stock and
his farm of 600 acres.</p>
<p>We are told that Phillip entertained the officers after the
inauguration ceremony, and on royal birthdays, with 'a cold
collation', and Collins relates how, on the arrival of the Second
Fleet of transports, 'we learned that our beloved Sovereign had
been attacked and for some months afflicted with a dangerous and
alarming illness, though now happily recovered. Our distance from
his person had not lessened our attachment, and the day following
the receipt of this information, being the anniversary of His
Majesty's birth, it was kept with every mark of distinction that
was in our power. The Governor pardoned all offenders who were
under confinement, or under sentence of corporal punishment; the
ration was increased for that day that everyone might rejoice; at
the Governor's table, where all the officers of the settlement and
garrison were met, many prosperous and happy years were fervently
wished to be added to His Majesty's life.' . . . 'On the 9th, being
the day appointed for returning thanks . . . the attendance on
divine service was very full. A sermon on the occasion was preached
by the Rev. Mr Johnson'. . . and 'the officers were afterwards
entertained at the Governor's, when an address on the occasion of
the meeting was resolved to be sent to His Majesty.'</p>
<p>The address as a whole may be 'taken as read', but the following
paragraphs are perhaps of sufficient interest to be placed on
record here:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The little community which has now the honour of addressing
your Excellency for the first time, cannot pass it by without
anticipating in idea the many and memorable occasions which will be
represented hereafter to His Majesty's faithful subjects of this
distant settlement, to congratulate him and his illustrious
descendants&mdash;whether extending the arts and blessings of
peace, or covered with the trophies of necessary and glorious
war.</p>
<p>'Although from remoteness of situation, and want of intercourse
with the seat of government, we are the last in His Majesty's far
extended empire to testify our joy on this occasion, we trust that
our zeal and fidelity to his royal person will for ever remain
unquestioned, as we know them to be pure and unalterable.'</p>
<p>Phillip sent it to Grenville with the following short and
dignified letter, dated June 14th, 1790, with which this chapter
may fitly conclude:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Sir,&mdash;The approbation which His Majesty has been pleased
to express of my conduct can only be merited by an earnest desire
of faithfully and successfully discharging the charge reposed in
me.</p>
<p>'It is, Sir, through you that I am honoured with this mark of
attention from my Royal Master, and through you, Sir, I hope that
my grateful sense of His Majesty's bounty will be made known.</p>
<p>'The address I received on His Majesty's being happily restored
to health I have the honour to enclose; and faithfully attached to
His Royal Person, by every tie of duty, gratitude and affection, I
rejoice in the happy event.'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>
<p class="negindent1"><small>SOCIETY IN 'BOTANY BAY'
(CONTINUED)&mdash;THE NEW SOUTH WALES CORPS&mdash;A DUEL&mdash;MRS
PARKER'S VISIT&mdash;THE RUM TRAFFIC AND ITS EVIL
EFFECTS.</small></p>
<p>I<small>N</small> the famine time, Collins says, the little
society that was in the place was broken up, and every man seemed
left to brood in solitary silence over the dreary prospect before
him.</p>
<p>With the exception of the Johnsons, the only free women and
children in the settlement were the families of the marines, and it
was not until the arrival of the New South Wales Corps, in the
ships of the Second and Third Fleets, that a 'Government House set'
began to loom on the social horizon.</p>
<p>Many of the officers of the regiment were men of good family.
Major Grose, who brought with him a Commission as
Lieutenant-Governor, and was accompanied by his wife, was a man who
had seen much active service, and it was at his suggestion, and by
him, that the corps was raised. The senior captain was a brother of
Nepean, the Under-Secretary to the Home Department, and Macarthur,
the senior lieutenant (whose name will be remembered when all the
others are forgotten, since he founded the wool industry of the
colony), took pains to prove himself, on the passage out, 'an
officer and a gentleman.' Says the <i>Morning Post</i> of 2d
December 1789:&mdash;</p>
<p>'In consequence of a private dispute on board the
<i>Neptune</i>, Captain Gilbert, the commander of that ship,
attended by his second, Mr Nelson of Plymouth Dock, met by
appointment Lieutenant Macarthur of the Botany Bay Rangers, with
his second, the surgeon's mate of the <i>Neptune</i>, at the Old
Gun Wharf, near the lines. The distance of ten paces being
measured, both gentlemen fired their pistols together. Lieutenant
Macarthur's ball passed through Captain Gilbert's coat. They then
fired a second pistol, each without effect, when the seconds
interposed, and the business was settled by Lieutenant Macarthur
declaring Captain Gilbert's conduct was in every respect that of a
gentleman and a man of honour. In the evening, Lieutenant Macarthur
declared the same on the quarter-deck of the <i>Neptune</i>, to the
satisfaction of all parties. It is said that the quarrel originated
on a refusal of Captain Gilbert to admit Lieutenant Macarthur into
his own private mess; at the same time he offered him every
accommodation for himself and his family that the ship would allow.
This brought on some dispute, which occasioned very high words, but
we are happy to say the duel ended without bloodshed.'</p>
<p>Mrs Macarthur, in letters to England written soon after her
arrival at Sydney in 1791, gives us a not altogether gloomy picture
of the colony. Some weeks were passed cheerfully, if not gaily. 'On
my first landing everything was new to me&mdash;every bird, every
insect, every flower, etc.&mdash;in short, all was novelty around
me, and was noticed with a degree of eager curiosity and
pertubation that, after a while, subsided into that calmness I have
already described. In my former letters I gave you the character of
Mr Dawes, and also of Captain Tench. Those gentlemen and a few
others are the chief among whom we visit; indeed, we are in that
habit of intimacy with Captain Tench that there are few days pass
that we do not spend some part of together. Mr Dawes we do not see
so frequently. He is so much engaged with the stars that, to mortal
eyes, he is not always visible. I had the presumption to become his
pupil, and meant to learn a little astronomy. It is true that I
have had many a pleasant walk to his house (something less than
half a mile from Sydney), have given him much trouble in making
orrerys, and explaining to me the general principle of the heavenly
bodies; but I soon found I had mistaken my abilities, and blush at
my error.</p>
<p>'Still, I wanted something to fill up a certain vacancy in my
time, which could neither be done by writing, reading or
conversation. To the two first I did not feel myself always
inclined, and the latter was not in my power, having no female
friends to unbend my mind to, nor a single woman with whom I could
converse with any satisfaction to myself.</p>
<p>'I shall now tell you of another recourse I had to fill up some
of my vacant hours. Our new house is ornamented with a pianoforte
of Mr Worgan's. He kindly means to leave it with me, and now, under
his direction, I have begun a new study; but I fear, without my
master, I shall not make any great proficiency. I am told, however,
I have done wonders in being able to play off <i>God Save the
King</i>, and Foot's <i>Minuet</i>, besides that of reading the
notes with great facility.'</p>
<p>The Governor gave a dinner during the stay of the <i>Gorgon</i>,
when, according to Collins, upwards of fifty persons were at table,
and such a gathering had not before been witnessed in the
colony.</p>
<p>We have a picture of Phillip's entertaining the new arrivals
from England in the <i>Gorgon</i>, drawn by Mrs Parker, wife of the
captain of the ship, which is worth reproducing here:&mdash;</p>
<p>'When we went on shore, we were all admiration at the natural
beauties raised by the hand of Providence without expense or toil.
The gentle ascents, the valleys, and the abundance of flowering
shrubs, render the face of the country very delightful. The shrub
which most attracted my attention was one which bears a white
flower, very much resembling our English hawthorn; the smell of it
is both sweet and fragrant, and perfumes the air around to a
considerable distance.</p>
<p>'In Botany Bay there are not many land-fowls; of the larger
sort, only eagles are seen; of the smaller kind, though not
numerous, there is a variety, from the size of a wren to that of a
lark; all of which are remarkable for fine loud notes and beautiful
plumage, particularly those of the paroquet kind. Crows are also
found here, exactly the same as those in England.</p>
<p>'Our amusements, although neither numerous or expensive, were to
me perfectly novel and agreeable; the fatherly attention of the
good Governor upon all occasions, with the friendly politeness of
the officers, rendered our <i>s&eacute;jour</i> perfectly happy and
comfortable.</p>
<p>'After our arrival here. Governor King and his lady resided on
shore at Governor Phillip's, to whose house I generally repaired
after breakfasting on board; indeed it has always proved a home for
me: under this hospitable roof I have often ate part of a kangaroo
with as much glee as if I had been a partaker of some of the
greatest delicacies of this metropolis, although latterly I was
cloyed with them, and found them very disagreeable.</p>
<p>'We made several pleasant excursions up the cove to the
settlement called Parramatta. The numerous branches, creeks and
inlets that are formed in the harbour of Port Jackson, and the wood
that covers all their shores down to the very edge of the water,
make the scenery beautiful; the north branch is particularly so,
from the sloping of its shores, the interspersion of tufted woods,
verdant lawns, and the small islands, which are covered with trees,
scattered up and down.</p>
<p>'Upon our first arrival at Parramatta, I was surprised to find
that so great a progress has been made in this new settlement,
which contains above one thousand convicts, besides the military.
There is a very good level road, of great breadth, that runs nearly
a mile in a straight direction from the landing-place to the
Governor's house, which is a small, convenient building, placed
upon a gentle ascent, and surrounded by about a couple of acres of
garden ground: this spot is called Rose Hill. On both sides of the
road are small thatched huts, at an equal distance from each other.
After spending the day very agreeably at the Governor's, we
repaired to the lodging which had been provided for us, where we
had the comfort of a large wood fire, and found everything
perfectly quiet, although surrounded by more than one thousand
convicts.</p>
<p>'This little excursion afforded us the opportunity of noticing
the beautiful plumage of the birds in general, and of the emu in
particular, two of which we discovered in the woods. Their plumage
is remarkably fine, and rendered particularly curious, as each hen
has two feathers generally of a light brown; the wings are so small
as hardly to deserve the name. They can run with such swiftness
that a greyhound can with difficulty keep pace with them. The flesh
tastes somewhat like beef.' *</p>

<p>Before the first Governor left, the traffic in rum was already
growing into an evil, and Phillip, foreseeing the consequences,
wrote home more than once on the subject. Grose, Phillip's
successor, as soon as he took charge, relaxed the wise restrictions
put upon the sale of spirits by Phillip.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson, in a letter to Hunter on the state of the colony
during the administration of Phillip's successor, shows the effect
of the liquor traffic:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Yourself, sir, being a kind of resident amongst us at the first
formation of the colony, and for some time afterwards, I need not
state to you the plans adopted and the measures pursued by Governor
Phillip for the proper regulation and good order of the colony, as
well as in a moral as in a civil point of view.</p>
<p>'Little or no alterations were made from those plans or
measures, from the time you then left us to that when Governor
Phillip himself returned to England, in December 1792.</p>
<p>'Some time previous to his going I was at his request sworn in
to act as a civil magistrate in your place, which duty I continued
to perform until the time he left us, at which time the colony was
as peaceable, orderly and moral as could be expected from such a
description of people as the colony was formed of.</p>
<p>'But no sooner had Governor Phillip left the colony than I was
convinced that the plan or measures of Government were about to
undergo an entire change. The civil magistrates, within two days,
received an order that their duty would in future be dispensed
with, and from that time till your Excellency's arrival again in
the colony, everything was conducted in a kind of military
manner.</p>
<p>'This, I believe, was the first step toward overturning all
those attempts and endeavours that had hitherto been planned and
pursued for the establishment of good order to be kept up amongst
the different ranks and orders of the inhabitants of the
colony.</p>
<p>'Every order that had been given tending to promote morality and
religion seemed to be laid aside, and fresh orders issued tending
to banish whatever (in the opinion of a good and virtuous mind) is
or ought to be the first considered and promoted (and particularly
in a colony like this, where by far the major part of the
inhabitants are lost to all sense of virtue, and abandoned to every
species of wickedness), viz., a reverence for the Supreme Being,
and a strict observance of all His just and righteous
precepts.'</p>
<p>Surgeon Arndell in a letter on the same subject says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Nothing more painful or distressing can be imagined than our
situation during the last-mentioned period. The departure of
Governor Phillip from the colony was soon followed by a surprising
change in the management of civil affairs: for the security of good
order and public peace were in a moment almost annihilated, and a
torrent of licentiousness bore everything civil and sacred before
it. Whatever was injurious or disgraceful to human nature might
have been reasonably expected from general drunkenness; yet general
and habitual drunkenness absolutely became the unfortunate fashion
of the times: the consequence was that crimes of every sort
increased to an alarming degree: thefts and robberies became so
numerous that they were spoken of as mere matters of course, and
even rapes and murders were not infrequent. The respect due to
superiors, and the subordination so essential to the welfare of
civil society, seemed banished from the minds of the unthinking
multitude, and that to such a degree that no one could think
himself safe in passing from one part of the town to another. Among
several insults I have myself met with, a soldier accosted me one
evening in the road at Parramatta and insisted on my spending a
bottle with him. Upon saying that I would see him home to his
barracks he told me he would spare me that trouble by knocking me
down, which he would certainly have done at the moment if he had
not been prevented by a person who joined us at the time.'</p>
<p>Six years before this time Phillip had written thus to
Nepean:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The impossibility of preventing the convicts' cloathing and
necessaries from passing into the hands of those for whom those
articles are not intended, makes me wish that every article
intended for the convicts should be marked. Their linens and
woollens might, I think, without any additional expense, have
stripes of a different colour wove in them. The iron pots and every
other article should likewise be marked: and this is absolutely
necessary, for a convict will sell for a pint of spirits the
necessaries which should serve him for months, and there always
will be those who will purchase them. . . .</p>
<p>'The landing of spirits without having a permit has been
prohibited in the Port Orders, in order to prevent the convicts
procuring any; but if some duty was laid on all spirits landed in
the settlement it would more effectually answer the purpose. The
duties so collected would, of course, be applied for the benefit of
the Crown. You will. Sir, favour me with your opinion on that
head.'</p>
<p>The Government informed him that an allowance of rum for the
troops was on the way out, and to this Phillip replied, in 1792,
that 'the permitting of spirits amongst the civil and military may
be necessary, but it will certainly be a great evil.'</p>
<p>A similar, but less serious, scandal was promptly put a stop to
by Phillip. This was the bringing out of contraband cargo. The
Governor wrote home in reference to this in November 1791, to the
Commissioners of the Navy, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Having been informed that there were great quantities of
cordage, copper, lead and iron on board the <i>Albemarle</i>,
<i>Active</i>, <i>Admiral Barrington</i> and <i>Queen</i>
transports, the masters of those ships were sent for, and from the
master of the <i>Albemarle</i> an account was received of what they
admitted to have been put on board by the owners, which they say
was done after Government had sent all the stores and provisions
which were intended for the colony, and that they had never
declared their ships full. A copy of the account received from the
master of the <i>Albemarle</i> is enclosed, but which can be but a
very small part of what those ships have brought out: a copy of the
masters' declaration as to their having never declared their ships
full is likewise enclosed.</p>
<p>'The great inconvenience attending the want of limestone has
been pointed out: and if it was necessary for those ships to bring
ballast, limestone might have been put on board, and would have
been easily changed for the stone of this country, and which I hope
the Board will order to be done on any future occasion.'</p>
<p>It must be admitted that Phillip's time was pretty well occupied
in the serious duties of his office, and that in a colony where the
Governor had to devise means to feed his people, to see that ships
arriving in his territory brought limestone for general use,
instead of lead for private purposes, and to take care that the rum
traffic was kept within bounds, it is scarcely to be wondered at
that the 'social functions', which nowadays are among the chief
duties of Australian Governors, in Phillip's time took the form of
an occasional 'cold collation', or an invitation to dinner with a
request to 'bring your bread in your pocket.'</p>

SYSTEM&mdash;THE FIRST BONA-FIDE EMIGRANTS&mdash;THE INCEPTION OF
THE WHALING INDUSTRY&mdash;PHILLIP'S FAILING HEALTH&mdash;HIS
DEPARTURE FOR ENGLAND.</small></p>
<p>'W<small>HENEVER</small> I want a thing well done in a distant
part of the world, when I want a man with a good head, a good
heart, lots of pluck and plenty of common sense, I always send for
a captain of the Navy.'</p>
<p>Lord Palmerston, when Minister for Foreign Affairs, is alleged
to have more than once used these words in the Council Chamber, and
English ministers were apparently of this opinion long before his
time, for during the first dozen years of Australian colonisation
three naval commanders&mdash;Phillip, Hunter and King&mdash;were at
different periods appointed to govern the distant colony.</p>
<p>If, in Palmerston's day, the shade of Lord Sydney ever lingered
near his old chair at the council-table, one can imagine an
approving whisper, 'Hear, hear! my appointment of Phillip proved
that long ago.'</p>
<p>Before coming to the date when Phillip began to pack up what few
worldly goods his four years' service in New South Wales had left
him, there is one act of his administration which cannot be
overlooked&mdash;that is the manner in which he regulated the
disposal of Crown lands.</p>
<p>The Land Laws of New South Wales are now in such a condition
that an eminent Queen's Counsel has said, with truth, that no man
living can safely undertake to interpret their meaning.</p>
<p>That 'good head' with 'plenty of common sense', which Palmerston
extols as qualifications found in sea-captains, enabled Phillip, in
dealing with the land, to form a sound theory and to put it into
practice; and from Phillip's time to the present the theory has
been much the same, but in its practical application common sense
has long since departed, and a confused jungle of land legislation
has grown up in its place.</p>
<p>Phillip's 'Instructions' when he left England empowered him to
issue land grants to emancipated convicts. He very soon found that
the country would never be settled without free colonists of the
farming class, and his despatches continually urged upon the Home
Government the necessity of offering some inducement to such people
to come out. No notice was taken of these representations, but he
was, by an additional set of 'Instructions' sent out in the Second
Fleet, empowered to offer Crown lands as an inducement to the
non-commissioned officers and men of the military force to remain
in the colony after their term of service had expired.</p>
<p>Phillip knew very well how land should be granted, for, six
months after his arrival, he wrote to Lord Sydney as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Farmers and people used to the cultivation of lands, if sent
out (and without which agriculture will make but very slow
progress), must be supported by Government for two or three years,
and have the labour of a certain number of convicts to assist them
for that time, after which they may be able to support themselves,
and to take the convicts sent out at the expense which Government
is put to for their transportation; but then, I presume, none
should be sent whose sentence is for a less term than fourteen
years. A yearly fine is to be paid for the lands granted, after the
fifth year; the fine to be in grain, and in proportion to the crop:
and this, I hope, would be the only tax laid on the crops: giving
the church lands in the room of tythes. The sending out settlers
who will be interested in the labour of the convicts, and in the
cultivation of the country, appears to me to be absolutely
necessary. Lands granted to officers or settlers will, I presume,
be on condition of a certain proportion of the lands so granted
being cultivated or cleared within a certain time, and which time
and quantity can only be determined by the nature of the ground and
situation of the lands: and, in that case, when lands are granted
to officers, the garrison must be sufficient for the service of the
place, and to permit such officers occasionally to be absent at the
lands they are to cultivate, and for a certain time: they likewise
must be allowed convicts, who must be maintained at the expence of
the Crown. Your Lordship will be pleased to consider this opinion
as given in obedience to orders, on a subject which requires more
consideration than I can give at present, and at a time when I have
only a very superficial knowledge of the country for a few miles
around.'</p>
<p>Here, then, was outlined the assignment system, and the plan of
granting land on condition that it was turned to a good use. Of
course it is not pretended that Phillip originated these ideas, but
that he had studied the subject sufficiently to be able to make the
suggestions is remarkable enough in a man whose life had been spent
on board ship&mdash;and on board ship over a hundred years ago!</p>
<p>The conditions on which he was empowered to grant land were, as
Phillip saw, impossible of fulfilment, and he gave settlers
inducements in the way of provisions and labour in excess of his
instructions, a step on his part which his superiors never
questioned. The Government, curiously enough, at first made no
provision for granting land to commissioned officers, and as a
result the land lent them by Phillip to cultivate brought in only
small returns, since those to whom it was lent could take but a
languid interest in such temporary ownership. When the case was
represented to the Home Office, permission was granted, but the
despatch reached the colony after Phillip left it. With the
granting of authority to assign land to officers began the growth
of the abuses of the privilege, for in the case of commissioned
officers no limit was assigned in the 'Instructions' as to the
maximum grant which the Governor might make. Yet Phillip foresaw
the necessity for restriction, and a few months before he left the
colony he wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Experience has also pointed out many inconveniences attending
the receiving men as settlers who only look to the convenience of
the present moment. With some the sole object in becoming settlers
is that of being their own masters, and with others the object is
to raise as much money as will pay their passage to England, and
then assign their lands to those who take them with the same view.
There are many of this description at Norfolk Island; . . . but, as
they have not received their grants, the necessary steps will be
taken to prevent this imposition by removing some from the island,
and by granting leases of only five or seven years to others, for
one or two of these people have attempted to dispose of their
grounds as soon as their huts were built, and they had received
that assistance which had been promised them.'</p>
<p>With regard to free settlers there is on record a quaint
correspondence between a Quaker named John Sutton and the Home
Department. Sutton thus wrote to Under-Secretary King:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Friend King,&mdash;Thou being so busy, it is not likely I can
see thee to-day. Have inclos'd a paper similar to that given to
Evan Nepean, only it is more specific. I hope thou will give it a
proper sanction, and it will obveate any future disapointments. And
if it be agreable to let me have any terms to carry persons, or
provisions live or dead, I believe I can do it as low and more
beneficial to the colony than it has hitherto been done. I will
call in two or three days for thy opinion.'</p>
<p>Nothing came of Sutton's proposal, which was that he should be
given land-grants, free passages, tools, and all the rest of it,
for a party of Quaker emigrants; but in February 1793, the
<i>Bellona</i> arrived in the colony with five men who were given a
grant of land near Parramatta, which was appropriately named
Liberty Plains. These five men were the first batch of
<i>bona-fide</i> emigrants&mdash;the advance guard of that great
army of colonists who have made Australia what it is.</p>
<p>Previously to 1791&mdash;although Dampier saw whales in
Australian waters&mdash;no one appears to have thought that a whale
or seal fishery could be founded there. But Phillip in a despatch,
written in November 1791 to Secretary Stephens, commented upon the
great number of 'spermaceti whales' that had been observed upon the
coast, which gave him reason to hope that a whale fishery might be
established at some port in the colony. Melville, the master of the
transport <i>Britannia</i>, before alluded to in these pages, had
seen such vast numbers of whales after doubling the south-west cape
of Van Diemen's Land, that after disembarking his cargo of convicts
he asked Phillip to expedite his ship's departure in order that he
might cruise in search of them. Phillip gave him every assistance,
and Melville, who was a shrewd man, got away as quietly as
possible, but the object of his haste soon leaked out, and the
<i>Britannia</i> was quickly followed by four other
transports&mdash;the <i>Matilda</i>, <i>William and Ann</i>,
<i>Salamander</i> and <i>Mary Ann</i>. Fifteen days later Melville
returned to Sydney, and reported that although he had seen great
numbers of whales the bad weather prevented his lowering his boats
except upon rare occasions. However, the <i>Britannia</i> and the
<i>William and Ann</i> between them had killed seven; but a heavy
south-east gale coming on they saved but one fish each. The <i>Mary
Ann</i> soon followed them back, her coppers having been 'washed
down' in the gale. She, with the <i>Matilda</i>, had gone southward
in search of seals and had seen no whales, and when they were
returning to Sydney, the latter vessel put in to Jervis Bay to stop
a leak. Phillip was pleased to learn from her master that it
possessed 'an exceedingly good anchorage, and room for the largest
ship to work in or out with great safety.'</p>
<p>From that time, Phillip, though disappointed at the result of
the transports' first cruise, took a deep interest in forwarding
the whaling industry. He doubtless did not realise that one reason
for the want of success that attended the first venture was the
lack of knowledge on the part of the masters of the transports.
None of them, probably, knew anything of the migratory habits of
the cetacean tribe in the Southern Seas, nor the difference between
the highly valuable 'sperm', 'right' and 'hump-back' whale, and the
dangerous and unassailable 'fin-back'. But experience was soon to
be gained, and, in March 1792, Phillip again wrote home, expressing
this opinion:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The information given in my former letters respecting the
prospect there was of establishing a spermacetic whale fishery on
this coast was drawn from the accounts I received of the great
number of fish which had been seen by two of the whalers. None of
those ships remained out but for a very short time; but when the
<i>Britannia</i> sailed, the master of that vessel told me he
intended to remain three months on the coast, in order to give it a
fair trial, that he had no doubt of seeing fish, but feared the
currents. From some information which I have received since that
ship sailed, I fear that the fur trade on the north-west coast of
America, and the trade amongst the islands, is too great an object
to those who are employed in the fishery ever to admit their giving
this coast a fair trial, and apprehend that all the ships have left
it. Should a fishery ever be established on this coast, and which I
should suppose likely to answer as well as the one which has been
established many years in the Brazil (at Sta Catharina and Rio de
Janeiro), I think it would be found to answer best if carried on in
small vessels, as it is from Rio de Janeiro; and with respect to
the currents, I believe they are neither more frequent nor stronger
than what they are on the Brazil coast.'</p>
<p>This was the beginning of South Pacific whaling, which, now
practically extinct, for the first half century of Australian
colonisation was only second in importance to the wool trade in the
commercial history of the colonies.</p>
<p>In April 1790, King had carried home this modestly-worded and
characteristically unselfish request from Phillip, in a private
letter to Lord Sydney:&mdash;</p>
<p>'As the settlement is now fixed, whenever His Majesty's service
permits, I shall be glad to return to England, where I have reason
to suppose my private affairs may make my presence necessary; but
which I do not ask in any publick letters, nor should I mention a
desire of leaving this country at this moment, but that more than a
year must pass before it can possibly take place, and I make no
doubt but that every inconvenience now felt in this colony will be
done away before this letter reaches your Lordship. I am sorry to
say that nine-tenths of us merit every little inconveniency we now
feel.'</p>
<p>And again in 1791 he wrote to Lord Grenville, in March and
November:&mdash;</p>
<p>'It is not without concern that I find myself obliged to request
His Majesty's permission to return to England. A complaint in the
side, and from which, in more than two years, I have been seldom
free, has impaired my health, and at times puts it out of my power
to attend to the charge with which His Majesty has been pleased to
honor me in the manner I wish and the state of the colony requires.
The settlement is now so fully established that the great labour
may be said to be past; and it has, Sir, been attained under every
possible disadvantage, though it is not in that situation in which
I should wish to leave it, for it is not independent for the
necessaries of life; and, as I feel myself greatly interested in
the good of a colony with the establishing of which I have been
honored, and to which I should wish to return, if the cause which
now obliges me to desire permission to leave it should be removed
by the voyage, or by the assistance I may find in London, I
therefore only request leave of absence from the government.' . .
.</p>
<p>'I am honoured with your Lordship's letter of the 19th of
February, in answer to mine to Lord Sydney, and beg leave to assure
your Lordship that I should not hesitate a moment in giving up my
private affairs to the public service; but from a complaint which
so very frequently puts it out of my power to use that exercise
which my situation requires, and the present state of this colony,
in which I believe every doubt respecting its future independency
as to the necessaries of life is fully done away, I am induced to
request permission to resign the government that I may return to
England in hopes of finding that relief which this country does not
afford.'</p>
<p>The only reply he received to these letters was the following
paragraph of a despatch, dated May 1792, from Dundas, then at the
head of the Home Office, who wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>'I cannot conclude this letter without assuring you how much I
lament that the ill state of your health deprives His Majesty of
your further services in the government of New South Wales, and I
have only to hope that, on quitting the settlement, you will have
the satisfaction of leaving it in a thriving and prosperous
situation.'</p>
<p>This was so obscure that Phillip cannot be blamed for not
understanding it, as he writes in the following October:&mdash;</p>
<p>'You are. Sir, pleased to express your regret at my being
obliged to return to England on account of my health, and I feel
much satisfaction from the manner in which that circumstance is
mentioned.</p>
<p>'How far that part of your letter to which the above alludes may
have been intended to convey to me His Majesty's permission to
return, I am doubtful, and although I am inclined to think it has
been written with that intention, and feel how necessary it is for
me to give up, at least for a time, the charge of this government,
which is very far from what I wish to do at the moment the colony
is approaching to that state in which I have so long and anxiously
wished to see it; still, Sir, I fear there is a possibility of its
being expected that I should remain until permission to quit the
government is more fully and clearly expressed; and as there
appears to be a wish that I should remain in this country some time
longer, I shall wait the arrival of the next ships.'</p>
<p>And at the same time he wrote to Nepean:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The manner in which Mr Dundas speaks of my leaving this country
is very handsome; but I do not well understand that part of his
letter. I fear that it may have been supposed I would remain until
His Majesty's permission was clearly expressed; and I should be
sorry, after all my labours, to have it said on my return that I
was not expected. The ship which was to follow the <i>Royal
Admiral</i> will, I hope, clear up the doubt, and not only leave me
at liberty to quit the government, but also put the means of doing
it in my power, otherwise I do not see how I am to get home after
the <i>Atlantic</i> has sailed, unless it is by the way of China or
the north-west coast of America, neither of which would be very
agreeable to a man going in search of health.'</p>
<p>And Collins tells us that in October 'The month closed with a
circumstance that excited no small degree of concern in the
settlement: Governor Phillip signified a determination of quitting
his government and returning to England in the <i>Atlantic</i>. To
this he was induced by perceiving that his health hourly grew
worse, and hoping that a change of air might contribute to his
recovery.'</p>
<p>On the 11th December 1792, Phillip embarked for England. Among
his last acts before leaving was to increase the weekly ration at
Sydney, and to send some stores to Norfolk Island. Says
Collins:&mdash;</p>
<p>'His Excellency had always attended to this little colony with a
parental care; often declaring that from the peculiarity of its
situation he would rather that want should be felt in his own
Government than in that dependency; and as they would be generally
eight or ten weeks later than this colony in receiving their
supplies, by reason of the time which the ships necessarily
required to refit after coming in from sea, he purposed furnishing
them with a proportion of provisions for three months longer than
the provisions in store at this place would last: and His
Excellency took leave of that settlement, by completing, as fully
as he was able, this design.</p>
<p>'He was now about taking leave of his own Government. The
accommodations for His Excellency and the officers who were going
home in the <i>Atlantic</i> being completed, the detachment of
marines under the command of Lieutenant Poulden embarked on the
5th, and at six o'clock in the evening of Monday the 10th, Governor
Phillip quitted the charge with which he had been entrusted by his
Sovereign, and in the execution of which he had manifested a zeal
and perseverance that alone could have enabled him to surmount the
natural and artificial obstacles which the country and its
inhabitants had thrown in his way.'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>
<p class="negindent1"><small>LATER LANDMARKS IN AUSTRALIAN
HISTORY&mdash;PHILLIP'S ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND&mdash;A PENSION GRANTED
HIM&mdash;FAVOURABLE COMMENTS UPON HIS WORK&mdash;HIS NAVAL
PROMOTION&mdash;HIS RETIREMENT TO AND DEATH AT BATH.</small></p>
<p>T<small>HE</small> story of the growth of Australia, after
Phillip left it, need not be told here. Things did not, indeed, go
smoothly under his immediate successors, and the officials in
England soon found the despatches from 'Botany Bay' more worrying
than the mild requests of Phillip for something to eat. In 1808
Governor Bligh, the hero of the Bounty mutiny, was forcibly deposed
by the military, who took the government of the colony into their
own hands. This revolt led to the appointment by the Home Office of
Governor Macquarie, under whose rule the colony made rapid
progress.</p>
<p>Other milestones in Australian history are the settlement of Van
Diemen's Land (Tasmania), West Australia, South Australia, Port
Phillip (Victoria), and Queensland, and their formation into
independent colonies; the stoppage of convict transportation; the
establishment of representative government; and the discovery of
gold. With all these things we have nothing here to do, for they
all happened long after Phillip's day. It only remains to tell what
little is known of the after life of the first Governor.</p>
<p>Phillip arrived in England in May 1793, and a couple of months
later, in this letter to the Home Secretary, he formally resigned
his office:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="right"><small>'<small>LONDON</small>, 23<i>d July</i>
1793.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></p>
<p>'<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;Being convinced by those I have
consulted that the complaint I labour under may in time require
assistance which cannot be found in a distant part of the world,
and that the time in which such assistance may become necessary is
very uncertain, I find myself obliged to request that you will,
Sir, represent my case to His Majesty, and that I may be permitted
to resign the Government of New South Wales.</p>
<p>'It is, Sir, with the greatest regret that I ask to resign a
charge which, after six years' care and anxiety, is brought to the
state in which I left it; but I have the consolation of believing
that I have discharged the trust reposed in me to the satisfaction
of His Majesty's Ministry, and hope that I may still be of service
to a colony in which I feel myself so greatly interested.</p>
<p>'As I remain in town in consequence of the message I received
from Mr King that you would speak to Mr Pitt respecting my enjoying
the moiety of the salary for my life, I shall, Sir, take it as a
favor if you will inform me if my continuing in town is still
necessary, or whether that matter, to me of such consequence, is or
will be settled, and that I am at liberty to leave town; for,
although I have given up all hopes of the Bath waters being of any
service in my complaint, they may in other respects be
beneficial.&mdash;I have,
etc.,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>A.
PHILLIP.'</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>For his colonial service the Government granted him a pension of
&pound;500 a year, which reward he acknowledged in the following
letter:&mdash;</p>
<p>'I should long since have done myself the honor of writing to
acknowledge the obligation I am under for the pension which His
Majesty has been pleased to grant me, but that I flattered myself I
should have an opportunity of doing it in person, as I was so
frequently at the office on matters relative to the colony. I now,
sir, beg leave to assure you that I shall ever retain a due sense
of the obligation, and trust that my hope of having the pension
fixed, so as not to cease on my attaining any one of those places
to which officers look up as rewards of past services, or to which
in the course of service a commanding officer might find it
expedient to appoint me, will meet with your approbation. I allude
to a seat at either of the Naval Boards, Colonel of Marines, or
Greenwich Hospital, places to which I may hope hereafter to lay a
just claim, independent of my services in New South Wales.'</p>
<p>Many letters are in existence showing that, despite his failing
health, he never lost interest in the colony. For example, in
November 1793, remembering what delay in the despatch of store
ships meant to the exiles, he wrote privately to the Home
Office:&mdash;</p>
<p>'By a letter I have just received, I am informed that the
<i>Mangoff George</i> has been examined and approved of; but that
the captors' demands are something more than what the surveyors
have valued her at, though the difference is very small. If that
ship is calculated to answer the purpose, and I understand she is,
do, for God's sake, point out to the Naval Board that every day
lost is attended with a very considerable expence to this country.
It is exactly the value of the animal food consumed by 4000 people
when the freight is added. The state of the colony, probably
without any vessel on the station, is still of more
consequence.'</p>
<p>His old officers often wrote to him to confirm their statements
of their services, and he frequently interceded on their behalf at
the Home Office. King he was especially anxious to see promoted for
his good work, and he strongly recommended his appointment as
Governor of New South Wales, a recommendation which, after Hunter
had been consulted, was acted upon.</p>
<p>When King was at Portsmouth in 1799, preparing to leave England
to take command at New South Wales, we find Phillip still his warm
friend and among the last to wish him good-bye. Writing to Sir
Joseph Banks in reference to the matter of conveying plants across
the sea, King says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Captain Phillip, who is now standing by me, says that he has no
doubt, if the <i>Atlantic</i> had been able to furnish a tarred or
painted canvas to cover the plants, but that the most part of those
he brought from New South Wales would have arrived home. The
precautions they took, and those he would have taken if he had the
means, he has communicated to me, and I shall be happy to give my
assistance in making that alteration.'</p>
<p>Just before King sailed, Phillip wrote to him this letter, which
shows both his generosity and the esteem in which he always held
his comrade:&mdash;</p>
<p>'As two of the cows lost' (in the bush) 'soon after our landing
in New South Wales were my property, I have an undoubted claim to a
share in the cattle, since found to have increased in so
extraordinary a manner, and as Government puts the care of such
part of their cattle, to which they have a claim, under the
protection of the Governor for the time being, I now give you all
my interest therein, to dispose of as you may judge proper; and in
doing this I may, and certainly shall, render a very essential
service to that country, as no cattle can be killed without the
consent of the Governor and yourself, or whoever you vest your
property in when you leave the country.</p>
<p>'When the cows were lost, they were five in number; three were
the property of the Crown, and two were mine. The bull and heifer
belonged to the Crown also.'</p>
<p>And in a subsequent letter, he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'You will not forget that before you left England I gave you a
full power to take possession of, and dispose of, as your property,
my claim on and share in the cattle running wild in the woods, and
two cows belonging to me, having strayed with the cows belonging to
the Crown.'</p>
<p>Long after he left the colony he was being continually quoted by
his successors as an example of a 'good Governor.' Hunter, on his
arrival in 1795, for instance, wrote thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Had the original regulations of Governor Phillip, as they stood
when I left the colony in 1791, remained, with such alterations or
amendments as the various existing circumstances might have
rendered necessary, I should have known at once what I had to do;
but to find upon my arrival in 1795 that the whole had been
abolished as soon as he departed, I own, surprised me. There surely
were some good rules amongst those he had established; and I can
venture to say from my own knowledge that there was order and
discipline in the colony then, and not near so many robberies. But
by this rather too sudden and indelicate abolition of these
regulations, which certainly had the appearance of a reflection on
the conduct and measures of that gentleman, we would suppose there
had not been one fit to be continued.'</p>
<p>And again in a reply to a petition from some settlers, enclosed
in a despatch written in 1800, Hunter uses these words:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The settlers should recollect that there is a wide difference
in the situation of the colony from the years 1791 and 1792 to
1800. At the former period there was no commerce, and but little
farming. Governor Phillip . . . gave every encouragement to
agriculture in his power. The number of farmers was few, and the
little stock that was brought into the country in 1788, after an
interval of four years, enabled him to issue the increase to such
people his goodness led him to consider as deserving. Whether they
were does not admit of a doubt. It is notorious they (almost to a
man) approved themselves undeserving of this indulgence. The
Governor, therefore, wishes to contrast that time with the present.
At Governor Phillip's departure in 1792 there were not above sixty
settlers throughout the whole territory&mdash;Port Jackson and
Norfolk Island. Of these a few received sheep; some goats; but
several had neither the one nor the other. Now, there are upwards
of a thousand settlers.'</p>
<p>A year later King wrote to the Home Office, describing the state
of the colony, and he tells us how:&mdash;</p>
<p>'Previous to Governor Phillip's departure, he gave each settler
two ewes belonging to the Crown; to some officers he had been
equally liberal. As these sheep were given with an expectation and
an injunction not to be parted with, it was hoped that each settler
might raise a good stock; but on his departure, every ewe, except
those belonging to one settler, was purchased from those unthinking
people at five gallons of spirits a head. This accounts for so
great a proportion of sheep being in the hands of officers, and
those which do not now belong to officers have been sold by them to
the present possessors.'</p>
<p>Even Margarot, most contumacious of men, one of the 'Scotch
martyrs' transported just after Phillip reached England, seems to
have found something to admire in the first Governor. In a letter
written by the 'Martyr' expressing his views upon the way in which
the colony should be governed, he says: 'When you recalled one
gentleman you ought to have given us another. The first error of
the Ministry was the suffering Major Grose to succeed to that
worthy man, Governor Phillip.'</p>
<p>After leaving the colony, Phillip saw very little further sea
service, the only recorded appointment of his that we can find
being the command of the <i>Alexander</i> from March to October
1796. He was promoted, in 1801, Rear-Admiral of the Blue; in April
1804, Rear-Admiral of the White; in November 1805, Rear-Admiral of
the Red; in October 1809, Vice-Admiral of the White; in July 1810,
Vice-Admiral of the Red; and on the 4th June 1814, Admiral of the
Blue.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* For the verification of these particulars the
Authors have to thank Mr Ferdinand Brand, Librarian to the
Admiralty.]</p>
<p>Phillip's old friend wrote to his son in 1808 two letters which
give us a last glimpse of the old admiral. The first letter is from
Tooting in Surrey, written in July, 1808, and in it King
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'I was with Admiral Phillip a week; he is very much altered,
having lost the entire use of his whole right side, arm, and leg;
his intellect and spirits are as good as ever. He may linger on
some years under his present infirmity, but, from his age, a great
reprieve cannot be expected.'</p>
<p>Seven days before his death in September 1808, King wrote
another letter from Bath, in which he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>'As this letter may probably reach you before you sail, I just
write to say that I came here on Tuesday with Mr Lethbridge, on his
return to London, merely to see Admiral Phillip, whom I found much
better than I possibly could expect from the reports I had heard,
although he is quite a cripple, having lost the entire use of his
right side; but his intellects are very good, and his spirits are
what they always were.'</p>
<p>Phillip lingered on until the 31st of August 1814, when he died
at Bath at his residence. No. 19 Bennett Street, on the lower
slopes of Lansdown Hill. For eighty-three years his burial-place
remained unknown, until, through inquiries instituted by the New
South Wales Government nine years ago, his tomb * was finally
discovered in St Nicholas's Church, Bathampton&mdash;a short
distance from Bath&mdash;by the present vicar, the Rev. Lancelot
John Fish. It is a quiet and beautiful spot, in spite of its
proximity to the Great Western Railway, and has been chosen as the
last resting-place of many distinguished servants of the State.</p>
<p class="foot">[* It is a plain flat slab in the passage leading
from the door into the aisle, and the inscription upon it is as
follows:&mdash;'Underneath lie the remains of A<small>RTHUR</small>
P<small>HILLIP</small>, Admiral of the Blue, who died 31st August
1814, in his 76th year. Also of I<small>SABELLA</small>, relict of
the above A<small>DMIRAL</small> P<small>HILLIP</small>, who died
7th March 1823, in the 71st year of her age.' There is also a small
and unobtrusive monument, high up on the north wall of the tower,
on which is stated that 'Near this Tablet are the Remains of
<i>Arthur Phillip</i>, Esq., Admiral of the Blue, First Governor
and Founder of the Colony of <i>New South Wales</i>.' It would
certainly seem fitting that some more worthy memorial of so good
and great a man should be placed in the church, and the vicar has
suggested that one of the windows in the aisle facing the tomb
might be filled with stained glass.&mdash;[E<small>D</small>.]]</p>
<p>The first Australian newspaper, the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>, which
had then been in existence about ten years, thus briefly records
the death of the first Australian Governor:&mdash;</p>
<p>'A London paper of a recent date announces the death of
Vice-Admiral Arthur Phillip, at an advanced age. This event took
place at Bath on 31st August last. To this gentleman the colony of
New South Wales owes its original establishment in 1788; and in
taking a retrospect of the arduous duties of such an undertaking,
the many difficulties he had to struggle with, and the perils to
which he was exposed, it will be only rendering a just tribute to
him to remark that Governor Phillip manifested, during the period
of his administration, much fortitude, zeal and integrity; and that
to the wisdom of his early regulations and indefatigable exertions,
the present flourishing state of the settlement bears most
honourable and ample testimony. Governor Phillip died in the 77th
(<i>sic</i>) year of his age.'</p>
<p>Phillip's contemporaries have left little enough material from
which biographers can to-day create a personal interest in the man,
and the writers feel that in their attempt to describe the first
Governor of New South Wales and the manner of his governing,
Phillip never stands out distinctly from the picture of his work.
His quiet, self-contained nature gave Collins, Tench, and the
others no chance to write of what the Governor said or how he
behaved on this or that occasion. They can only tell us what the
Governor did. His own letters speak for themselves, but all they
reveal is that he invariably knew how to go about the work in hand,
and that he had every confidence in himself to carry it through
successfully. With a mind large enough to write in 1787 that 'I
would not wish convicts to lay the foundations of an empire,' with
the statesmanlike foresight that could in the next year add, 'I do
not doubt that this country will prove the most valuable
acquisition Great Britain ever made,' Phillip was still so
thorough, so possessed of that capacity for detail, of that
thoughtfulness in little things which counts for so much in the
management of all great concerns, that he could in the very
despatch which contained these 'memorable sentiments ask for iron
pots for cooking, and remember that the women were short of
gowns.</p>
<p>His perfect self-reliance and belief in his ability to pull the
colony through its worst misfortunes, led him sometimes, perhaps,
to write too cheerfully for his own and his charges' comfort. Even
in the dismal time of famine, a month after the wreck of the
<i>Sirius</i>, when the settlement was on the brink of starvation,
he sent to the Home Secretary such moderately worded letters that
Lord Sydney either affected to think or actually believed that the
colony was almost flourishing; for in April 1790, Sydney stated
that he had received two letters containing three requests from
'our friend Phillip, who represents the new settlement as having
nearly overcome its difficulties. . . . The last (letter) refers to
his request for leave to return home for the regulation of his
private affairs. . . . He makes his last request with much the
least earnestness. . . .'</p>
<p>And this was the nature of the man. Is it not the nature of most
true Englishmen? Does not this habit of working silently, 'putting
a good face on it', doing the thing given them to do, and not
talking of it&mdash;does not this, above all, characterise the best
of the men who have gone out from home to the uttermost parts of
the earth, and there so wrought that to-day we know them as
'Builders of a Greater Britain?'</p>

<h3>APPENDIX I</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> information obtainable with regard to Admiral
Phillip's family is of the most meagre description. His father,
Jacob Phillip, as has been said, was a native of Frankfort, who
settled in London as a teacher of languages, and his mother was an
Englishwoman, Elizabeth Breach, whose first husband was Captain
Herbert, R.N. He had at least one sister, whose Christian name is
unknown. She married a Mr Dove, and left a daughter, Mary Ann Dove,
from whom, by her marriage in 1811 with Mr Thomas Lancefield, the
present representatives of the family are descended.</p>
<p>The writer of the <i>Anecdotes of Governor Phillip</i>, prefixed
to his '<em>Voyage</em>' (Stockdale, 1789), after an allusion to
the restoration of Peace * in 1763, says that 'Phillip <i>now</i>
found leisure to marry'; but the surname of his wife is not stated.
On the tombstone in Bathampton church her Christian name (Isabella)
is given, and she is described as being 'in the 71st year of her
age' in 1823, so that she must have been born in or about 1752, and
could consequently only have been 11 years old at the date
mentioned by the writer of the '<i>Anecdotes</i>.' As Phillip did
not enter the Portuguese Service until 1774-5 (<em>see</em>
Appendix II.), and is supposed to have been living at Lyndhurst,**
in Hampshire, during the interval, it is probable that the marriage
took place at a later date; but further uncertainty is caused by a
statement to be found in the <i>Adventures and Recollections of
Captain Landman, late of the Corps of Royal Engineers</i> (1852),
who mentions a meeting that he had in 1796 with the Admiral and
'Mrs Phillip, a lady he had <i>recently</i> married.' On the whole,
one is driven to the conclusion, that either the date given by the
writer of the <i>Anecdotes</i> is incorrect, or that Phillip was
*** twice married. There is no doubt that he left a wife behind him
when he went to Australia. I am indebted to the Rev. Arthur Phillip
Lancefield, of Over Tabley, Knutsford, for the subjoined letter, in
which the history of the Admiral's collateral descendants is
traced:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* The words 'Peace, with its blessings, was
restored in 1763', are omitted from the official transcript of
these <em>Anecdotes</em> in Vol. I. of the <i>History of New South
Wales from the Records</i>, p. 496.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** A careful examination of the Lyndhurst and
Minstead registers, kindly undertaken by the Rector, has so far
failed to produce any evidence of this.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** This is distinctly stated in Vol. LXXXV.

<p>'D<small>EAR</small> S<small>IR</small>,&mdash;My father (Thomas
William Lancefield) died in my infancy, having given my mother
hardly any information as to his connection with Admiral Phillip. I
think you have a copy of Phillip's will, and as legacies are left
by it (after his wife's decease) to persons not bearing his
surname, the presumption is that he left no children, and that no
direct descendants of his are living.</p>
<p>'I believe the connection to be this. Phillip's sister, of whose
Christian name I am ignorant, was my great-grandmother and married
a Mr Dove; his Christian name is also unknown, as well as the time
and place of marriage. Their daughter, Mary Ann Dove, was married
on August 1, 1811, to my grandfather, Thomas Lancefield. You will
see that my grandmother, Mary Ann Lancefield, was one of Phillip's
legatees, she being his niece, but all her share of the property
was lost in the costs of a Chancery suit of the type of
"<i>Jarndyce</i> v. <i>Jarndyce</i>." My grandparents had a family
of nine children, but only two sons reached manhood, my father,
Thomas William Lancefield, born 1814, died 1869, and my uncle,
Arthur Phillip Lancefield, born 1823, died 1871. A daughter, Anne,
was married to Charles Widgeon Haywood, M.D., and died in 1864,
leaving one son, James.</p>
<p>'To the best of my knowledge, my elder brother and I are the
only two individuals named after the Admiral. My brother, Victor
Phillip Lancefield, has one daughter, Maud Vernon Lancefield.</p>
<p>'Regretting much that I can give you so little
information.&mdash;I am. Sir, yours very truly,</p>
<p align="right">'A<small>RTHUR</small> P<small>HILLIP</small>
L<small>ANCEFIELD.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></p>
<p>With Mr Lancefield's assistance the following pedigree has been
compiled:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Image3" id="Image3"></a><img alt="" src=
"1302981h-images/Image3.jpg"></p>
<p>The other children of Thomas and Mary Ann Lancefield were Thomas
(<i>b</i>. 1813, <i>d</i>. 1814), Isabella and Eliza (twins)
(<i>b</i>. 1815, <i>d</i>. 1816 and 1822), Isabella Phillip
(<i>b</i>. 1817, <i>d</i>. ? 1818), and Matilda Eliza (twin with
Arthur Phillip) (<i>b</i>. 1825, <i>d</i>. 1825). It seems possible
(says Mr Lancefield) that the Christian name of the Admiral's
sister was Eliza; and he draws attention to the attempts to
perpetuate the names 'Isabella' and 'Eliza', as well as to the
combination 'Isabella
Phillip.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>H.

<h3>APPENDIX II</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> following documents, which it has been
thought best to print <i>in extenso</i>, and partly in the original
Portuguese as well as in translations, have been discovered in the
National Archives at Lisbon by General de Brito Rebello, who is the
Principal Librarian and Keeper of the Records, and translated by Mr
G.J. Henriques. Nos. 1-10 give a connected account of the
introduction of Phillip by one of his official superiors at the
Admiralty (Rear-Admiral the Hon. Augustus John Hervey, afterwards
Earl of Bristol) to the Portuguese Minister in London, as a
candidate for employment in the Portuguese Navy. Admiral Hervey's
first letter (No. 2) is dated 25th August 1774, and the royal
warrant of appointment (No. 10) the 14th January 1775. As Mr
Henriques, in his letter to myself communicating the discovery,
puts it, 'you now have a complete narrative of the circumstances
under which Phillip entered the Portuguese Service; the name of the
gentleman (apparently connected with the Admiralty in London) who
introduced him; nearly the exact dates of his leaving London and
arriving in Lisbon; the terms of his engagement; and last, but not
least, the unbiassed testimony to his worth and capacity given by
his contemporaries when he was still of subordinate rank.' Nos.
11-34 afford a number of interesting glimpses into the life the
young Englishman led while serving abroad in the Portuguese Navy,
and show how much appreciated he was by his foreign employers.</p>
<p>I have to thank the Portuguese Minister in London (M. de
Soveral) and the British Minister in Lisbon (Sir Hugh Macdonell)
for the kind interest they have taken in this quest, nor must I
forget my friend Mr Eric Barrington of the Foreign Office, who
first gave me the clue which I have followed up. To General de
Brito Rebello, for his painstaking researches in the Archives, and
to Mr G.J. Henriques for the excellent translations of the
Portuguese documents I must also express my sincere
acknowledgments. The letters, etc., only came to light last March,
when this book was already in print; so that they could not be
inserted in their natural place in the biography. The notes are due
to General de Brito Rebello.</p>

<p><span class="h">Your Excellency</span>,&mdash;I place before
Your Excellency the original letter which I lately received from Mr
Hervey about the officer who desires to enter His Majesty's
service.</p>
<p>The said officer, since then, came direct to me, and verbally
stated the details of his conditions, which consist in the
following points:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&mdash;That, in consideration of what he gives up here, and
the superior advantages which it is the custom for English officers
to enjoy when they are on the Retired List, he be allowed, in the
Portuguese Service, the same pay as foreign officers receive when
on active service at sea.</p>
<p>2.&mdash;That when on the Retired List he be allowed half of
that pay.</p>
<p>3.&mdash;That a promise be made to him that, immediately upon
his arrival in Portugal, a Commission of Captain of the Fleet will
be issued to him.</p>
<p>The officer in question said not a word to me about an allowance
for travelling expenses; but, as it is probable that he will broach
the subject, I should like to be positively informed as to what I
ought to reply. Meanwhile, I limited myself to assuring both Mr
Hervey and the person recommended by him that I would place the
said letter and proposals before my Court, and would communicate to
him the reply which I might receive thereon.</p>

<p>That the King Our Master is quite convinced that the information

capacity of an officer who merits his recommendation.</p>

afloat and ashore, double the pay which is given to Portuguese
officers in either case.</p>
<p>That this double pay is forty mil reis <sup>1</sup> per month on
land, and eighty mil reis <sup>2</sup> at sea; and they have, in
addition, when on board of frigates of war, four thousand eight
hundred reis, <sup>3</sup> or, on board of ships of the line, six
thousand four hundred reis <sup>4</sup> per day for their table, to
which they ought to admit the Commissioned Officers and the
Chaplains of their crews, they receiving, in addition, for their
said table, as many rations from the hold as there are persons of
the aforesaid rank who eat at it.</p>

<p>That it is not customary in Portugal to fix the amount of pay in
case of retirement; that it is not usual for deserving officers to
retire so long as they are able to serve; and that when it so
happens, from incapacity of those officers, or other motive which

Phillips, to whom, as well as to Mr Hervey, I at once communicated

<p>The latter gentleman assured me that the officer in question
could not desire anything more; but that he wished me not to
conclude the affair until he had returned from the country, where
he was going for six days.</p>
<p>He only said to me that he presumed that, in the Portuguese
Service, Captains of the Fleet sailed also in Frigates; a practice
which might give rise to some difficulty on the part of Mr
Phillips, because his pretension was to be captain of a ship of the
line as it is understood here; which, in England, makes a great
difference.</p>
<p>I confessed to Mr Hervey that I was not informed as to the
practice in the Portuguese Navy; that it was possible that a case
might occur in which necessity would require it; but that the
Captains of the Fleet of the Crown were Commanders of ships and
ranked as such in Portugal.</p>

<p><span class="h">Illm&deg; Senhor</span>,&mdash;Em 25 de Novembro
de 1774 recebi a carta de V. Sa com data de 8 de Novembro, em
resposta da que lhe dirigi em 15 de Outubro: E para V. Sa puder
informar Mons<sup>r</sup> Hervey e Mr Phillips sobre a pergunta que
lhe fizeram, &eacute; preciso dizer-lhe que na Marinha de Portugal
n&atilde;o ha a differen&ccedil;a de Capit&atilde;o de Fragata e
Capit&atilde;o de Nau de Linha, ou de alto bordo. Todos os
capit&atilde;es de mar e guerra tem a mesma
gradua&ccedil;&atilde;o, e s&oacute; preferem uns aos outros pela
antiguidade das patentes. O soldo &eacute; o mesmo ou andem em nau
ou em fragata; e s&oacute; os que commandam Nau de Linha tern para
mesa $6400 reis por dia, em raz&atilde;o de ser maior o numero de
officiaes a quern d&atilde;o de comer; os que andam em Fragata tem
$4800 reis em raz&atilde;o de ser menor o dito numero; e
al&eacute;m d'isto cada official dos que comem &aacute; mesa, tem
ra&ccedil;&atilde;o do por&atilde;o que recebe o capit&atilde;o de
mar e guerra.</p>
<p>Todo o capit&atilde;o de mar e guerra deve embarcar em nau de
linha ou em fragata, como lhe f&ocirc;r determinado, sem lhe ser
permittido fazer sobre est&atilde; materia, nem outra alguma que
respeite ao Real servi&ccedil;o, a menor duvida ou
difficuldade.</p>
<p>&Eacute; preciso que V. Sa informe igualmente a Mr Hervey e Mr
Phillips que no servi&ccedil;o de Portugal muito frequentemente
embarcam na mesma nau primeiro e segundo capit&atilde;o de mar e
guerra, e quando isto succede, o mais antigo &eacute; sempre o que
commanda: de sorte que um capit&atilde;o de mar e guerra deve
sempre estar prompto a embarcar ou seja em nau de linha ou em
fragata, e em qualquer d'ellas ou por primeiro ou por segundo,
conforme a antiguidade da sua patente.</p>
<p>Pode haver outros usos e costumes que presentemente me
n&atilde;o lembram; mas a todos elles se deve sujeitar o official
que entra n'este Servi&ccedil;o; sem que de alguma sorte pretenda
que se altere com elle o que se n&atilde;o pratica com os
outros.</p>
<p>Deos Guarde a V. Sa. Em 25 de Novembro de 1774.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small>,&mdash;On the 25th of November 1774, I
received your letter of the 8th of November, in reply to the one
which I wrote to you on the 15th of October. And to enable you to
reply to Monsieur Hervey and Mr Phillips, upon the question put by
them to you, it is necessary to inform you that, in the Portuguese
Navy, there is no distinction between the captain of a frigate and
the captain of a ship of the line. All Captains of the Fleet rank
alike, and only take precedence of each other according to the age
of their Commissions. The pay is the same whether they sail in a
ship of the line or in a frigate; only those who command a ship of
the line have for their table six thousand four hundred reis per
day on account of the number of officers whom they have to feed
being larger, and those who sail in frigates have four thousand
eight hundred reis, because the said number is smaller; and, in
addition thereto, each of the officers who eats at the table has a
ration from the hold, which is received by the Captain of the
Fleet.</p>
<p>All Captains of the Fleet have to sail in ships of the line or
in frigates, as they may be ordered; and it is not permissible for
them to raise, upon this subject, or upon any other relating to the
Royal Service, the slightest question or difficulty.</p>
<p>It is necessary that you should also inform Mr Hervey and Mr
Phillips that in the Portuguese Service very frequently a first and
second Captain of the Fleet sail in the same ship, and that when
this occurs it is always the senior in rank who commands;
consequently a Captain of the Fleet should be always prepared to
sail, whether it be in a ship of the line or in a frigate, and, in
either case, to be first or second in command, according to the age
of his Commission.</p>
<p>There may be other usages and customs which do not occur to me
at this moment; but an officer who enters this service must subject
himself to them all, without in any way presuming that alterations
will be made for him which are not practised with the others.</p>
<p>God preserve you. Lisbon, on the 25th of November 1774.</p>

<p>Y<small>OUR</small> E<small>XCELLENCY</small>,&mdash;I beg to
acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's Despatch, dated the
25th of November, which arrived at the moment when Captain Phillips
was on the eve of starting.</p>
<p>As soon as I received it, I communicated the contents of it both
to Mr Hervey and to the officer in question, to whom I put it in
its true light, so that he might never have cause for a grievance.
The only thing in it which he thought hard was the practice of two
captains very often serving in the same ship or frigate; but he
subjected himself to everything, and, in view of this, I informed
him that he could start whenever he liked.</p>
<p>Everybody reports highly of his intelligence and worth; I will
now hope that he will bear them out, and also the opinion given by
Mr Hervey of his character.</p>

three months. Phillip was at this time in command of her.</p>

the 28th, the frigate <i>Pilar</i> came in after sixty-two days of

her casks were in a very bad condition. I am now having them
repaired. This frigate requires that a great deal be done to her to
enable her to continue, as she ought, in the Royal Service; and, if
it is not done, she will, in a short time, be completely disabled;
but as, in the state in which she is, she can still serve if we can
manage to repair the pintles of the helm, I am provisioning her for
a period of three months, which will be until the end of June, so
as to be ready for whatever may be required of her; and I am going
to repair that which is most urgent, as far as time will allow.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small>,&mdash;Having received your Despatches, dated
21st of February and the 5th, 6th, 11th, 19th and 31st of March of
this year, together with the papers which accompanied them, I have
placed them before the King, my Master, through the Office of His
Secretary of State, just as I have done with all those of most
importance which you have addressed to me. However, until our Court
sends me its orders as to what I am to do with regard to the
contents of the said Despatches, I consider it my duty to reply to
you upon that which I think is more extraordinary in the said
Despatches, and which requires a prompt and positive answer.</p>
<p>In the first place, as regards the bad condition of the vessels,
etc., etc. . . . . .</p>
<p>In the second place, you tell me that all that has taken place
from the time you left until now is the result of none of your
proposals having been attended to, and, from the context of the
paragraph, the conclusion to be drawn is that there has been a want
of attention, and that I did not send vessels of the kind that you
asked for in the expedition to Rio Grande; which is true. I did not
send any of the kind that you asked for, because there were none in
this port, as I told you, but the others which I sent, although
inferior to those you wanted, were much superior to the greater
part of those which the Spaniards had, with the exception of the
three which they have at the entrance, and for which the frigate
<i>Gra&ccedil;a Divina</i>, the frigate <i>Pilar</i>, the frigate
from Pernambuco, and the corvette <i>Nossa Senhora da Victoria</i>
would have been more than a match. All of these, with the exception
of the corvette, were much stronger than the Spanish vessels; and
our other and smaller vessels could not only have helped the large
ones, but would have been ample in number and strength for
attacking the five insignificant vessels which the Spaniards have
got at Fort Mosquito. Such being my orders, and such the fleet
which I had appointed for the operation, I believe that no one will
fail to confess that, if those orders had been carried out to the
letter, the result would have been vastly different to what it was,
owing to your having altered everything, as you have always been in
the habit of doing, from the moment that you know that an order is
mine. You commenced by not allowing the frigate <i>Pilar</i> to be
one of those appointed to enter the river, alleging that it was
impossible for it to do so; whereas, when the vessels entered, it
was evident that the river was quite deep enough for her to have
entered just as the others did.</p>
<p>It is a fact that the river has not always the same depth of
water, and that there are many and many occasions on which neither
that vessel, nor others of lesser draught than her, could enter;
but those who were well acquainted with the river assured me
repeatedly that there were times when the river contained such a
depth of water that the vessel in question could go in without any
danger whatever.</p>
<p>I gave no order that she should enter whether there was
sufficient water or not; so why could you not have taken her with
you upon the chance that if the water was deep enough she should
profit by the opportunity, and thus have availed yourself of the
extraordinary addition to your strength which would result from the
co-operation of that frigate? Nothing of this you chose to do; but
you sent her prize-hunting, instead of letting her accompany the
expedition, which was the chief object I had in view when I
commissioned her, and thus she was rendered useless, although the
want of her was felt when the time came.</p>
<p>Further on you say that the vessels I sent were not seaworthy,
at the same time that you tell me that the sloop * which you built
in this port was an excellent vessel, and so good that you sailed
in her and found her competent to lead the way before the others.
If you could find her to be seaworthy, built as she was of green
wood, with her seams wide open, leaking like a sieve, and,
moreover, smaller than the others, which were not in like
circumstances, surely they were as good as she was.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The <i>Santa Catharina</i>.]</p>
<p>But more, I ordered you to select for that service the officers
and crews which you considered most competent. I would not appoint
a single person. I trusted everything to your zeal, honour and
intelligence; because, as you would be answerable to me for the
undertaking, I did not wish to hinder you in any way from acting
with every freedom, and entirely as you thought fit. What was the
result of my mode of proceeding? The vessels were manned by the
worst sailors of the Fleet. With the exception of two, the officers
appointed to command them were either people who had been taken
from the forecastle to be trained as officers, or volunteers,
without experience, to whom rank was at once given; and some
subalterns from the infantry, without any experience of these
parts. These were the commanding officers who were to carry out so
important an enterprise; while the officers of the Navy who had
been in battle, and under fire, such as Arthur Phillips,
Lieutenant-Captain Gaula (Galway?), and other officers of great
value on account of their honour and energy, were left out, and
sent to do that which the others could have done equally well.</p>

<p>Y<small>OUR</small> E<small>XCELLENCY</small>,&mdash;Since I
last had the honour of writing to Your Excellency, there has been
nothing fresh as regards the South, as Your Excellency will see by
Lieut.-General Jo&atilde;o Henrique de B&ouml;hm's letter, a copy
of which I have the honour to forward to you, together with a copy
of my reply and the other papers which bear upon the said letter. I
further forward to Your Excellency a copy of the reply which I
wrote to the Lieut.-General with regard to the letter which I had
already received, and of which I have already sent a first copy to
Your Excellency, and now send you a second.</p>
<p>By the letter last received Your Excellency will see that the
Spaniards are doing all that they can, and it is my belief that if
they were not afraid of the forces which I have on that continent,
and the quality of the troops, they would not have remained so
quiet, but would have continued to be as insulting as ever.</p>
<p>In compliance with the Royal Orders, I ordered the two frigates
which were in this Colony to withdraw. They were the
<i>Nazareth</i>, commanded by Captain Thomas Stives, and the
<i>Nossa Senhora da Gloria</i>, commanded by Captain Trist&atilde;o
da Cunha e Menezes. I allowed the frigate <i>Nossa Senhora do
Pilar</i>, commanded by Captain Arthur Phillips, to remain, because
I consider that, so soon as we have no war-ship there, it will not
be possible to prevent the insolent acts which the Spanish Corsairs
are continually perpetrating in that river.</p>
<p>The presence of the said three vessels had effectually put a
stop to all the acts of daring which they had practised upon our
merchant vessels and upon the fishermen, overhauling all and even
capturing some of them, as I have already informed Your Excellency.
The moment they discovered on board of them any hides or other
merchandise which they could allege had been obtained by
contraband, and, as regards the fishermen, even without that
excuse, they captured them and seized the slaves which they found
on board of them.</p>
<p>My intention is to order the said frigate to be relieved by the
<i>Gra&ccedil;a Divina</i>, which was at Rio Grande, they being the
two of those which I have most appropriated for navigation in the
River Plate.</p>
<p>If three frigates are kept constantly in this district, one to
remain in the Colony, another in the port of St Catherine's, and
the third in the port of this the capital city, in order to go to
the assistance of either of the others when necessary, and to guard
the coast, not only of that island, but of Rio Grande, as well as
to exchange every now and again with the one which is at the
Colony, that will, I think, be the only way to make ourselves
respected and ensure quiet.</p>
<p>The two frigates, the <i>Assump&ccedil;&atilde;o</i> and the
<i>Gloria</i> are utterly unseaworthy. Out of the two a very
handsome frigate might be built, to be the third to be stationed at
the River Plate, if Your Excellency will send the drawings for that
purpose.</p>
<p>Should the King, my Master, be pleased to decide to have these
frigates in this port and that the third one be built, it will be
most desirable that an officer, prudent, active and intelligent, be
sent to command this Division and superintend the building of the
frigate.</p>
<p>The most competent, in my opinion, of those who are here is
Captain Antonio Januario do Valle,* who is a most intelligent,
active, prudent and disinterested officer. There may be many others
equal to him in merit; but of those I know of I prefer him.</p>
<p class="foot">[* It was in his vessel and under him that Captain
Phillips sailed to the Brazils as Second Captain.]</p>
<p>The war-ship <i>Belem</i> which that officer commanded is almost
finished repairing. She was in a very bad state and has been
thoroughly overhauled. I might almost say that she has been
rebuilt. Every one assures me that she will be in first-rate
condition and will require nothing to be done to her for the next
seven or eight years. At the same time, I am having the <i>Principe
do Brazil</i> repaired, and, one after another, all the vessels of
the Fleet shall be gone over. They suffered terribly this year on
the Southern Coast and Rio Grande. The Commanding Officers tell me
that the roughness of the sea in those parts is indescribable, and
bears no comparison with that met with in the worst parts of the
European seas.</p>
<p>The two frigates which I have the honour to mention to Your
Excellency are utterly unseaworthy, so I have determined to lay
them up. I intend, however, to have them gone over, roughly, to
prevent their getting into a worse condition while I am awaiting
Your Excellency's answer.</p>
<p>As the frigate <i>Gloria</i> has not yet reached here, I cannot
send the report of the state in which she is, as I did with regard
to the two frigates, the <i>Assump&ccedil;&atilde;o</i> and the
<i>Princeza do Brazil</i>; but I will do so as soon as she
arrives.</p>
<p>I am informed that the Chief of the Fleet has sent to Your
Excellency a report with regard to me, a copy of which I forward
herewith, and I also send a sailor whom he had selected to be the
bearer of these despatches, because he would not entrust them to
me, thinking that I would try to prevent his laying before the
King, my Master, his account of my imprudences.</p>
<p>The General at St Catherine's would not allow this sailor to
proceed without a passport from me; but as I cannot tell but what
he may be charged with some more private matter of which Your
Excellencies ought to be informed, I send him on so that he may
execute his commission.</p>
<p>I must say that I am not in the least surprised at the force of
that Officer's language in the said letter. It is a common saying
with him before all the Fleet, that His Majesty ought to cut off
the heads of all the Generals who have the honour to serve him;
that they are all ignorant and traitors; and other expressions of a
similar nature. Your Excellency may imagine how constant has been
my pain, and that of all the officers who have the honour to serve
the King, my Master, and the misfortune to have to deal with this
man. But I have had the satisfaction of observing that from me
myself, the General in the South and the General at St Catherine's,
down to the lowest sailor, all, out of obedience and respect for
the Royal Orders of the King, my Master, have made the sacrifice of
putting up with him, and letting him see as little as possible what
our sentiments are.</p>
<p>I ask nothing of the King, my Master, upon this head. It will be
sufficient that His Majesty should see the extent to which my
respect and my obedience have guided me.</p>
<p>I have nothing more to lay before Your Excellency, whom God
preserve. Rio de Janeiro, 18th August 1776.</p>

<p>The Spaniards who, as regards Rio Grande, are reported to be
quiet, the Governor of the Colony continues to inform me are, in
those parts, more in evidence, not only as regards their squabbling
and their arrogant and defiant language, but because they have got
ready the three frigates and the ship of the line which they have
in the port, are sending more troops to Montevideo, are working
with great activity upon the barracks for fresh troops, and are, at
the same time, adding to the works of defence of their ports.</p>
<p>In spite of this the Governor, as he had received my order
withdrawing two of the frigates, caused them to leave for this
port, retaining only the frigate <i>Pilar</i>, commanded by Captain
Arthur Phillips.</p>

DE</small> P<small>OMBAL</small>.</p>
<p>Y<small>OUR</small> E<small>XCELLENCY</small>,&mdash;1st. With
the greatest sorrow, as Your Excellency may imagine, I now have to
announce the arrival of the Spanish Fleet at the port of St
Catherine's.</p>
<p>I forward to Your Excellency the first letter which I received
from the General of that Division. The second announcement which
the said General has made to me, and which it is my duty to repeat
to Your Excellency, was brought by the Captain of a small vessel,
who assures me that, down to the 25th of last month, the Spaniards
had not taken any action of importance, and it was only known that
they had landed some troops at Canavieiras Point, which is the port
by which they entered.</p>
<p>2nd. Although the General and the Governor of that island inform
me that the troops and the people who are there are very
unconcerned, and that they hope to offer a vigorous defence, I do
not consider that the island is strong enough to support itself and
resist; and this chiefly because the Enemy has no fear of our
Fleet, since the Chief, the moment he saw the Spaniards entering,
gave orders to all the ships to go as speedily as they could to Rio
de Janeiro. Any stroke of good fortune which may befall us will be,
to my mind, miraculous.</p>
<p>3rd. Shortly before receiving the news sent to me by the General
of the forces at St Catherine's, I was informed by the scouts which
I had upon the coast that seven vessels were in sight, coming from
the south and steering for this port. This information was
confirmed, so I at once proceeded to arm.</p>
<p>4th. After having been under arms during the greater part of the
following day, I received a letter from Captain Arthur Fillips,
informing me that he was accompanying the Fleet in obedience to
orders which he had received from the Chief, and that as he was the
one nearest to the land he acquainted me with the fact.</p>
<p>5th. Later on I received, through the First Officer of the
Chief's vessel, the letter which I forward to Your Excellency, and
which was followed, almost immediately, by the Chief himself.</p>
<p>6th. When he appeared before me, his countenance betrayed the
anguish which every man ought to feel under circumstances such as
those in which he was placed.</p>
<p>7th. I requested him to give me his reasons for leaving
unprotected the ports which were most exposed, and coming to put in
at Rio de Janeiro, which is the most defensible.</p>
<p>8th. He replied that the orders of the King, my Master, and mine
had forced him to do so. I shewed him that the contrary was the
fact; because, although the orders of the 31st July of last year, a
copy of &sect;&sect; 29, 30 and 31 of which, being those referring
to the Fleet, had been communicated to him by letter, I had
personally read to him the last orders but one, and the last which
I received in Your Excellency's letters of the 9th and 29th of
September, and the 8th and 9th of October, both of last year, and
upon his saying that he could not carry them out, and would not
take the responsibility of their execution, I placed them actually
in his hands, requesting him to take them, turn the matter over in
his mind, and give me his opinion and reply in writing, as I have
already informed Your Excellency in my Despatch of the 20th of
November of last year, when I sent you a copy of the said Chiefs
reply. In consequence of that reply, I issued the Letter of Orders,
of which I have also already sent you a copy, making him
responsible for all his actions, leaving him free to do whatever he
might consider to be most useful and honourable for the State, and
although I made some suggestions in the said letter, telling him
not to carry any of them into execution if he did not find that by
doing so the glorious results which we ought all to desire for the
State would not be attained. My said suggestions in no way hindered
him from doing whatever he might think to be most advisable for the
success of his movements, because, as he would be responsible to me
for the results, he ought to be entirely at liberty to act as his
intelligence and experience might lead him to believe was most
prudent.</p>
<p>9th. After that letter I wrote to him the other of which I
enclose a copy, which he asserts that he did not receive.</p>
<p>10th. He further told me that he had taken the opinions of the
other Captains of the vessels, which they had given in writing, all
being to the effect that they ought to come to Rio de Janeiro. The
only dissident was Captain Jos&eacute; de Mello, who, in my
opinion, was the only one who voted as he ought to have done.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Further on (&sect; 12) and in the postscript we
are told when, and under what circumstances, the Captains were
consulted.]</p>
<p>11th. The Chief further said that the Spanish Fleet came in such
good order that it was impracticable to attack it, because its
forces were united, without there being a single point at which any
attempt could be made to throw them into disorder.</p>
<p>12th. The Chief sailed from the port of St Catherine's on the
16th of last month, upon receiving the first news of the Fleet
being in sight. On the 18th, when the Spaniards caught sight of us,
some of the Officers have informed me that we could have attacked
them to great advantage; because, not expecting us, they drew all
their force to the front, leaving their convoys to the rear, in
which direction we might have attacked them, if we had navigated
that night in a different way to that which we did. The Chief kept
our Fleet at so great a distance from the enemy that they were
unable to ascertain, with any certainty the number of vessels we
had. They paid no attention whatever to our Fleet, but improved
their line and steered straight for the port, <i>which they entered
on the 20th of last month, and when they were already entering, and
consequently were masters of the port, then it was that the Chief
called for the opinions of the Captains</i>, and, after receiving
them, issued the order for all of them to steer for this port.</p>
<p>13th. During this retreat, they twice sighted the two frigates
from Montevideo, which were looking out for their Fleet. Some of
our vessels gave chase to the said frigates, but with no results;
and although the chase ought to have been kept up in order to
prevent their entering the port with the pilots which they had on
board, this was not considered worth attention, and they came to
take refuge at Rio de Janeiro, where there are still to enter the
war-ship <i>Belem</i>, the <i>Principe do Brazil</i>, and two of
the smaller vessels, fitted as fighting ships, and called the
<i>Sacramento</i>, and the yacht <i>S&atilde;o Francisco
Xavier</i>.</p>
<p>14th. Finding myself in these circumstances, I wrote immediately
to the Governor of St Paul's for him to come to the assistance of
the island with all the forces of his district, by land; and, as
soon as the missing vessels arrive, I intend to send off a body of
800 or 900 men selected from the very few regulars which I have
here, for the purpose of seeing if it is possible to relieve the
island, either by the river St Francisco, or by crossing the range
of mountains at the base of which lies the lake, or by availing
myself of the route along the coast which leads to the
mainland.</p>
<p>15th. The place at which our forces may be and the intentions of
the Spaniards must decide which will be the best starting-point. I
ordered the Chief to immediately commence cruising with our Fleet
between Port St Catherine's and the River Plate, in order to
impede, as much as possible, the Spaniards at the island from
communicating with the other ports which they hold on the banks of
that river. He stated that the greater part of the vessels
composing his Fleet are incapable for that service, or for anything
else that could be useful; that the best ones for the purpose would
be the three war-ships, the <i>Santo Antonio</i>, the
<i>Prazeres</i>, and the <i>Belem</i>, and the three frigates
<i>Principe do Brazil</i>, <i>Princeza do Brazil</i>, and <i>Nossa
Senhora do Pilar</i>,* as the <i>Gra&ccedil;a Divina</i> is
absolutely fit for nothing, and the war-ship <i>Ajuda</i> is almost
entirely rotten. Of the small vessels only two can be made use of
for the different orders which it may be necessary to convey.</p>

requesting him to state whether or not I had read over to him, and
handed to him for his private perusal, the last orders which I
received as to what the Fleet was to do at the island of St
Catherine's. His reply you will see by the copy of his letter,
which I also send, in which he denies those orders, but mixes up
things in such a way that he confesses some and denies others. At
the same time, the reply which he gave with regard to the carrying
out of those orders, a copy of which I have already sent to Your
Excellency, and now forward another, shows that he examined them
with sufficient minuteness to be able to make the reflections
thereon contained in his letter; and this <i>lack of sincerity is
the spirit in which this Officer has always sought, sometimes to
deny, and at others to misinterpret the orders given to him, to
avoid the carrying out of which he refrained from mentioning them
when he called the Council of the Captains</i>. All of these
documents I forward to Your Excellency for your full knowledge and
my justification; and it is my duty to repeat to you, that when I
have erred it has simply been from lack of ability, which I have
always insisted was wanting in me for such important matters.</p>

<p>We, the Captains and Commanding Officers, Jose dos Santos
Ferreira, Thomas Stevens, Antonio Januario do Valle, Jose da Silva
Pimentel and D. Francisco Xavier Telles, giving our votes upon the
question as to what our Fleet ought to do under its present
circumstances, are of opinion that:&mdash;</p>
<p>As all the movements which we can, for the present, execute,
whether attacking the Spanish Fleet, which is superior to ours, or
cruising in sight of it, imply a risk of our inferior Fleet being
destroyed, in spite of all our efforts, desires and diligence,
<i>which is contrary to His Majesty's positive orders which were
read to us</i>, we, consequently, ought to go and receive fresh
orders from H.E. Marquez do Lavradio, such as our present position
requires, whether risk should be incurred or not. On board of the

<br>
<p>With regard to His Majesty's orders, nothing can be done without
risk, not only because of the weakened state in which our Fleet is,
but also on account of the enemy's great strength. Every movement
implies risk; more especially when the forces are unequal.</p>
<p>Should our Fleet be destroyed, there will remain nothing to
prevent the enemy from carrying out hostilities in America.</p>
<p>They will endeavour to sack the ports at which they can do so;
and, under these circumstances, we ought, in any case, to fulfil
His Majesty's commands, confronting them with those of H.E. Marquez
do Lavradio.</p>
<p>All the movements of this Fleet ought to be executed in harmony
with His Majesty's orders, whether they be risky or not.</p>

<br>
<p>On the twentieth day of February 1777, at a Council of War
called by the Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Fleet, Robert
MacDonell, His Most Faithful Majesty's, my Master's, orders to the
said Commander having been read, which orders say that he ought to
leave St Catherine's to avoid an encounter with the Spanish Fleet,
which (so the orders say) is much superior to the Portuguese Fleet,
and the said orders stating that he ought to take every precaution
possible to prevent our Fleet being either lost or ruined by the
enemy; and stating further that should the enemy attack any part of
His Most Faithful Majesty's dominions in the Brazil, he ought to
attack Maldonado, Montevideo and Buenos Ayres, circumstances
permitting him to do so; I, finding myself obliged to give my
opinion as to what we can do of service to His Majesty,
say:&mdash;</p>
<p>That <i>my opinion always has been that our Fleet ought to
remain at St Catherine's to assist the fortresses in defending this
island; or, if we left it, that we ought to attack the Spanish
Fleet at all risks; but the Commander of the Fleet does not believe
that His Majesty's orders permit of his doing either of these
things. Now that the enemy is free from the encumbrance of its
transports, because they are anchored in the harbour of St
Catherine's</i>, their strength being, according to the general
opinion of the Commanding Officers of this Fleet, far superior to
ours, and they not being in want of men, because they can draw as
many artillery-men and infantry as they like from the ten thousand
men which they have to disembark, and, considering <i>the great
advantage that a strong fleet at anchor has over a weaker one which
goes to attack it, I see, at this moment, no advantage to be gained
by disobeying His Majesty's orders, or reason to warrant us in
doing so, and I therefore decide that we ought not to
attack</i>.</p>
<p>Maldonado cannot be taken without troops to be disembarked,
neither can Montevideo; and I do not think that it would be prudent
to risk our Fleet for the purpose of burning one ship of the line
and a few merchantmen, which may or may not be met with in the
harbour at Montevideo.</p>
<p>To be able to take Buenos Ayres with the few men that this Fleet
could land, it must be taken by surprise; and this cannot be done
with ships of the line, on account of the difficulty of navigating
the River Plate.</p>
<p>Off the island of St Catherine's.</p>

P<small>HILLIPS,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<i>Commanding His Majesty's Frigate 'Nossa Senhora do Pilar e
S&atilde;o Jo&atilde;o Baptista</i>.'</small></p>
<br>
<p>Having been asked about the resolution which we ought to take
with regard to the Spanish Fleet commanded by the Marquis de
Cara-Tilli (<i>sic</i>), which has arrived at this coast for the
purpose of conquering the Brazils, and in conformity with the
orders which this Fleet has received both from the Court at Lisbon
and from the Viceroy of the State, I reply:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st. That the orders received from Rio de Janeiro leave it open
to us to attempt every species of action against the Spanish Fleet,
let the order in which it comes be what it may, seeing that in two
places the order is to attack, and in one place to rather await the
attack of the Fleet, even although ours be inferior to it. In the
same orders the preservation of the Portuguese Fleet is
recommended, which does not agree with that which precedes it.</p>
<p>2nd. The River Plate and Buenos Ayres scheme cannot be carried
out because of the absence of a combination with the Governor of
the Colony and the General of the South. For this reason it must be
held to be non-existent, and I therefore say no more about it.</p>
<p>3rd. The orders of the Court of Lisbon are very clear in
prohibiting that the forces of this Fleet be risked, ordering that
it retire to the safer ports; and as the combination of these
orders forms the ground upon which my vote is based, I
say:&mdash;</p>
<p>That, at this present time, we have no course to pursue other
than to attack the Fleet, let its condition be what it may; for, if
the Court of Portugal knew the country as we know it, they would
have given the clearest and most precise orders upon this subject.
If the Spanish Fleet is not attacked it will effect the
disembarkation unimpeded, and afterwards turn upon us with greater
strength when it is free of its convoy. Although the Portuguese
Fleet be small it can do a great deal of damage to the Spanish
Fleet, and, should the latter be destroyed, they can undertake
nothing that can affect this State without reinforcements, before
the arrival of which fresh measures can be taken. This is the vote
I give in Council.</p>

<p align="center">The M<small>ARQUIS DO</small>
L<small>AVRADIO</small> to Senhor M<small>ARTINHO<br>
DE</small> M<small>ELLO E</small> C<small>ASTRO.</small></p>
<p>On the 26th of April there entered the harbour of this city our
Fleet which I had ordered to leave it on the 1st of that month, as
I informed Your Excellency direct, and also did so at greater
length through the Home Office, in a Despatch dated the 3rd of the
said month of April.</p>
<p>When the said Fleet was sailing towards the port and coast of
the island of St Catherine's, in obedience to my orders, they
sighted two vessels which appeared to be small, and the Chief at
once signalled the Fleet to give chase. The one who pressed most to
the front was Captain Jos&eacute; de Mello, and, as one of the
Spanish vessels thought, at first, that our Fleet was theirs, she
made no great effort to get away. The result of this piece of
carelessness was that when they found out who we were it was too
late to escape our man-of-war, and the Spanish vessel was forced to
strike. The other, however, got away.</p>
<p>An examination of the papers found on board of the captured
vessel, which was a <i>setia</i>, commanded by Lieut. Don
Jos&eacute; Justo Salcedo, shewed that the said officer had been
charged by the Marquis de Casa Tely to collect at Assumption Island
* the rest of the vessels of the Fleet which were wanting, and to
conduct them to Montevideo, which he did. A short time after his
arrival there came to that port two ships of the line, one called
the <i>Santo Agostinho</i> and the other the <i>Serio</i>, which
had sailed from Ferrol one month after the Fleet had left Cadiz.
These vessels carried despatches, with special instructions as to
their delivery to the two Generals, and these despatches were
entrusted to Don Bernardo Bonavia, Captain of the Regiment of
Infantry of Gallicia, who came in the Expedition, and was thus
already at Montevideo, and who, it is said, had been sent out
appointed to a higher post in which he was to be employed in the
island.</p>
<p class="foot">[* It ought to be <em>Ascension Island</em>.]</p>
<p>To ensure a more rapid delivery of the said despatches, the
<i>setia</i>, just mentioned, was ordered to set sail with the
officer in charge of them on board. As soon as they saw the risk
they ran of being captured, they threw the despatches
overboard.</p>
<p>At the same time it was discovered that the two ships which had
arrived from Europe were to have sailed with the first tide.
Captain Jos&eacute; de Mello went to inform the Chief of all this,
and he ordered them to remain off the coast a few days in the hope
of encountering them. This was done; and, on the 19th of that
month, the Chief signalled to all the Fleet to give chase, which
they did in the direction indicated by the signals. Captain
Jos&eacute; de Mello was the foremost in the chase, his vessel
being the fastest, and he was followed, but at a good distance, by
Captain Arthur Phillips.</p>
<p>These two vessels continued the chase, and, as soon as Captain
Jos&eacute; de Mello saw that they were within the range, he fired,
and his vessel it was that did the first damage. Captain Arthur
Phillips came up with his frigate, and was allowed by the enemy to
get closer, because they thought this vessel was one of their own,
as they were unable to convince themselves that a vessel so small
and so weak in artillery would venture to attack a 70-gun ship. It
was only when Captain Phillips poured a broadside into them that
they became aware that it was a frigate of ours.</p>
<p>The said Officer did this with a view to retarding the ship
sufficiently to allow Jos&eacute; de Mello to get closer; but the
Spanish Captain did nothing but crowd on sail to get away. All
through the night the two vessels chased the other, but they were
becalmed, and so the enemy managed, during the night, to get clear
of them. This, however, did not avail them much, for, when the
morning broke, the ship found herself near to the Chief of the
Fleet, who at once gave chase with the other vessels, and, in a
short time, got so close as to be able to open the fight. The
battle lasted only one hour and a quarter; and during that time
Jos&eacute; de Mello was able to attack with the rest of the
Fleet.</p>
<p>The Spanish Captain struck without losing more than four men,
and when his vessel had received no damage that he could not have
repaired while the fight was going on.</p>
<p>The disorderly way in which the Spaniards fought, the state of
confusion in which their vessel was, and the fright they were in,
appears to have been incredible. I think myself that they were in
as abject fear of our Fleet as were the wretches of the Island of
St Catherine. I hear that the men of our Fleet behaved in a most
praiseworthy manner. Of our people only one ordinary seaman
received a wound of any importance. His leg was shot off. The other
wounds were of so little importance that the men continued to fight
in spite of them.</p>
<p>The prize is a valuable one, for she is a new vessel, built of
excellent wood. She has first-rate artillery, and is completely
supplied with all munitions and accessories of the first class. As
the only damage she suffered was in the sails and the rigging, and
some splinters knocked out of the masts by the cannon balls, she
can be got ready at once to sail with the Fleet.</p>
<p>This encounter prevented our Fleet carrying out my orders. Had
they been executed, we should, by this time, have again been
masters of the port of the Island of St Catherine, and should have
destroyed the vessels at anchor in that port, which were of small
importance. We should also have captured the convoy which was
arriving from Montevideo with provisions for the Island; and the
want of food which the garrison, all over the Island, was already
beginning to feel, would have, undoubtedly, assisted the success of
the operation. But the Chief, fearing to meet with the entire Fleet
in that port, refusing to believe the information which was given
to him, as well as that which he derived from the sailing orders
which he seized, shewing that the Fleet had already set sail for
Rio Grande, in which latitudes it was sighted by the ships of war,
who counted more than forty vessels, as the log-books proved to
him; nothing of this sufficing, because that Officer's want of
courage can only be appreciated by those who, like myself, have had
a large experience of him on occasions of this kind, his fears, I
say, had more effect upon him than my orders and the information
which he had received, and he put into this port, bringing to me
the two prizes and reporting what had occurred.</p>
<p>The consequence of the failure to carry out my orders was that
the Spaniards received assistance and supplies, with which their
wants will be relieved for some time; and, if the Spanish Fleet had
not encountered, on the coast of Rio Grande, the violent storms
which have kept it in check from the 7th of April, when they were
met with some forty leagues to seaward of the mouth of that river,
down to the 3rd of May, when I had a letter from the General of our
army stating that they had not yet appeared, our enemy's run of
luck would have continued, and we should have been, each moment,
less in a position to obtain any victory over them. However, as the
private information which I have received from the Island of St
Catherine assures me of the inferiority of the naval force left
there, the fear which the Spaniards are in that they will again
suffer a want of provisions, the want of unity among the officers,
and the tendency of the men to desert, I feel bound to profit by
the opportunity, while our enemy's forces are divided, to destroy
them, little by little, until we remain the stronger, or, at least,
are in a position to fight them on equal terms.</p>
<p>With this view I have taken the following
measures:&mdash;Availing myself of some of the officers who had
served in that Island, men of recognised fidelity, liked by the
troops and by the people of the Island, and sufficiently robust for
work of any kind, I sent them, disguised, with instructions to
enter the Island, to find out the state in which the Spaniards
were, and the feeling of the people towards them, and to secretly
furnish the former with the means for throwing off the yoke the
moment I attacked the Spaniards. I further ordered them to make
overtures to the Spanish soldiers, inviting them to desert,
facilitating their desertion, and assisting them in every way. I
sent another officer, also trustworthy, to collect, upon the
mainland, with the greatest precaution, as many as he could of the
Portuguese soldiers who had withdrawn themselves in order to avoid
being given up, and to hide with them in the most eligible point of
the forest which he could find, so as to be ready, when the right
moment arrived, to assist in the attack or surprise which would
have to be made upon the Island.</p>
<p>These arrangements having been made, and the officers having
sent me word that everything was ready for the time when I might
order the vessels lying in the port of the Island to be attacked by
sea, I got the Fleet ready, increasing it by two more ships of the
line and a frigate. When it set sail it was composed of the five
line of battle ships&mdash;<i>Santo Antonio</i>, which is the
Flag-ship; <i>Nossa Senhora dos Prazeres</i>, Captain Jos&eacute;
de Mello; <i>Nossa Senhora de Ajuda</i>, now commanded by D.
Francisco Xavier Telles, because Jos&eacute; dos Santos Ferreira,
who was commanding it, remained dangerously ill in this city;
<i>Nossa Senhora de Belem</i>, commanded by Antonio Januario; the
prize, the <i>Santo Agostinho</i>, commanded by Arthur Phillips;
and the four (<i>sic</i>) frigates&mdash;<i>Principe do Brazil</i>,
Captain Thomas Stevens; <i>Gra&ccedil;a Divina</i>, Captain George
Hardcastle; and <i>Nossa Senhora do Pilar</i>, Captain Francisco
Bettencourt. All of these I supplied with everything that was
requisite to the entire satisfaction of the Commanding Officers,
and according to their wishes, and I caused them to set sail from
this port on the 29th of May, on which day, later on, the frigate
<i>S&atilde;o Jo&atilde;o Baptista</i>, Captain William Roberts,
came in.</p>
<p>I ordered the Chief to go to the Island of S. Catherine,
reconnoitre the naval forces which the Spaniards had there, and,
should he find that, without its being too rash a proceeding, our
forces were sufficient for the purpose, attack them and destroy the
vessels, but not to engage the fortresses, in order to avoid
endangering our Fleet, before we had destroyed some part of our
enemies, and also because, when once we were masters of the port,
we could prevent them from receiving supplies, without which they
would be forced to capitulate, as they have no other means of
obtaining food. GOD preserve Your Excellency. Rio de Janeiro, 2nd
June 1777.</p>

Phillips. Jos&eacute; de Mello commands the convoy. This Officer
has always conducted himself with great precision in all his
duties, and shewn the greatest activity and intelligence in his
profession, coupled with a large amount of zeal for the Royal
Service. I might say something more about him if our relationship
and the intimacy which I have enjoyed with him for many years did
not render me suspect.</p>
<p>The other Officers of that vessel have correctly done their
duty.</p>
<p>The commander of the <i>Santo Antonio</i> is Captain Arthur
Phillips, whom I consider to be one of the officers of the most
distinct merit that the Queen, my Mistress, has in her service in
the Navy, and I think that it will be a most important acquisition
to secure that he should remain in the Royal Service. This Officer
not only has a large theoretical knowledge of his profession, but
is well up in fortification and every other branch of the military
profession, and, moreover, has had practical experience from the
age of nine, when he commenced to serve as 'Guard to the Standard'
(midshipman?) on the war-ships of his country, up to Naval
Lieutenant. He took part in all of the more important engagements
which the English Fleets have had since he entered the service. As
regards his disposition, he is somewhat self-distrustful; but, as
he is an Officer of education and principle, he gives way to
reason, and does not, before doing so, fall into those exaggerated
and unbearable excesses of temper which the majority of his
fellow-countrymen do, more especially those who have been brought
up at sea. He is very clean-handed; is an Officer of great truth
and very brave; and is no flatterer, saying what he thinks, but
without temper or want of respect.</p>
<p>The length of my Report upon this Officer implies that I regret
him very much, and I confess that I do. <i>It is the consequence of
my having noted the great difference in the way he served, as
compared with the greater part of the others</i>. This which I
write to Your Excellency you will not only find to be corroborated
by such officers of merit as Your Excellency may consult; but you
yourself, with your great talent, when you have formed his
acquaintance, will render the same justice to his worth that I
do.</p>

<h3>No. 35.</h3>
<p align="center"><span class="h">Note by General Jacintho Ignacio
Dd Brito Rebello.</span></p>
<p>The first ten documents (Nos. 1-10) contain the negotiations
which preceded the entrance of Arthur Phillip into the Portuguese
Royal Navy, his departure from England and arrival in Portugal, and
the Decree by which he was made a Captain, in accordance with his
agreement.</p>
<p>As soon as he had been appointed to be Captain on the 14th of
January 1775 (No. 10) we see (No. 11) that on the 17th of that
month he was ordered to go on board the line of battle ship
<i>Nossa Senhora de Belem</i> as second Captain.</p>
<p>On the 25th he obtains leave to go to Salvaterra (No. 12), where
the Court then was, for the purpose, it is but reasonable to
suppose, of taking leave of His Majesty, and soliciting the
necessary letters of recommendation which would obtain for him the
sole command of a vessel upon his arrival at the Colony.</p>
<p>On the 6th of February the ship tried to cross the Bar (No. 13),
but could not do so, and she only got away on the 9th (No. 14).</p>
<p>The documents do not inform us as to the vessel's port of
destination, but it appears (No. 34) that when she returned on 8th
Septr. 1778 it was from Rio de Janeiro, and she came by
Pernambuco.</p>
<p>On the 20th of August she had been preceded by the <i>Nossa
Senhora dos Prazeres</i> and the <i>Santo Antonio and Sao
Jos&eacute;</i>, the latter of which was commanded by Capt. Arthur
Phillip (No. 31).</p>
<p>Thus we see that Capt. Phillip, upon arriving in Portugal,
sailed at once to the Brazils, where he remained in service for
more than three years, the exact time which elapsed between his
crossing the Bar of Lisbon outwards and his again crossing it on
his return being three years, six months and twelve days.<br></p>
<hr class="2">
<br>
<p>When Capt. Phillip first embarked as second Captain of the
<i>Nossa Senhora de Belem</i>, Antonio Januario do Valle, his
Chief, was one of the officers of the Portuguese Navy of best
repute. Soon after the ship reached the Brazils, the Viceroy,
wishing to strengthen the Fleet, armed some merchant vessels, one
of which was the <i>Nossa Senhora do Pilar</i>. She was converted
into a 26-gun frigate and placed under the command of Arthur
Phillip, and on the 27th January 1776 was sent to look out for
prizes in the south, for which reason she did not take part in the
unfortunate engagement of the 19th February (Nos. 17, 18). Later on
Phillip was sent with two more frigates to the River Plate, but
soon afterwards the latter were withdrawn for repairs. Though left
single-handed, his small vessel was found to be sufficient to keep
the Spaniards within bounds (Nos. 20, 21 and 27).</p>
<p>At the close of the year he went to Saint Catherine's to take in
firewood (No. 23), and found there, it is to be presumed, the order
requiring him to join the Fleet which was defending that Island, in
consequence of the preparations which were being made in Spain for
the despatch of a powerful armament and a large body of troops to
attack the Portuguese possessions. Unfortunately, upon the first
news of the arrival of the Spaniards, on the 16th February 1777,
the Chief of the Fleet, Robert MacDonell, raised his anchors and
set sail, in spite of Arthur Phillip's efforts to persuade him to
stay and fight. On the 20th, after the Spaniards had anchored in
the harbour of the Island, the Chief held a Council, at which he
only presented the orders which he had at first received&mdash;not
to risk his Fleet&mdash;and kept back the later ones. Arthur
Phillip's reply shews what his opinion was ( Nos. 24, 25 and
27).</p>
<p>After the Fleet had reached Rio de Janeiro it was again sent out
as soon as it was ready, and, meeting some Spanish vessels, gave
chase. Jose de Mello, in the <i>Nossa Senhora dos Prazeres</i>, and
Arthur Phillip, in the <i>Pilar</i>, took the lead. A <i>setia</i>
was captured, with important documents on board, and the Fleet
again put into Rio de Janeiro with the prize (No. 26).</p>
<p>Ordered again to leave the port, they chased a large Spanish
vessel, and again Jose de Mello and Arthur Phillip were to the
front. The latter, owing to the small size of his vessel, was able
to get very close without inspiring distrust, and poured in a
broadside. All night the chase continued, and in the morning the
Spanish vessel, finding herself surrounded by the Fleet, lowered
her flag. She was the <i>Santo Agostinho</i>, a 70-gun ship. Again
the Fleet returned to Rio de Janeiro, where the prisoners were
landed, a fresh crew provided, and the captured vessel placed under
the command of Capt. Phillip. The Fleet then sailed for manoeuvres,
but nothing is known of what was done by it (No. 26).</p>
<p>When the preliminaries for the Treaty of Peace had been signed
at Saint Ildefonso, on the 1st October 1777, the captured vessels
were returned, and, among them, the <i>Santo Agostinho</i>, On the
16th February 1778, the Viceroy, acting upon orders from home,
broke up the Fleet, ordering MacDonell to haul down his flag and
return to Lisbon in either a ship of war or a merchant vessel, as
he might think best. In consequence, he handed over the ship of the
line <i>Santo Antonio and Sao Jos&eacute;</i>, which had been the
Flag-ship, to Capt. Phillip, who, accompanying Jos&eacute; de
Mello, sailed in her with a Convoy to Europe in May 1778. The
Viceroy's despatch (No. 30), addressed to the Minister of the
Marine upon this occasion, is a crown of glory for Capt. Phillip,
and shews how much he was esteemed by his comrades and chiefs.</p>
