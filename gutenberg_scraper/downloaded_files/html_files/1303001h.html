  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; HARD UP.</h2>

  <p>Nothing from the hot languid street below but a grumbling, whining voice
  or two. A mean London street off the river in August. How men who know the
  country and have the scent of the sap in their nostrils can toil and moil
  under such conditions is known only to themselves and their God.</p>

  <p>High up a cheap low-flash lamp added to the heat of a third-floor room,
  and gave a spice of danger to the occupant's more sordid condition. The man,
  bending over a penny exercise book, rose as there came from below a
  succession of knocks growing gradually louder. The dull double thud came
  presently far down below. A small servant came presently and laid a letter by
  the writer's elbow.</p>

  <p>It was no manuscript returned or stereo-typed note of acceptance, nothing
  more than a curt intimation that unless the rent of the third floor of No.
  19, Pant-street, was paid before twelve o'clock to-morrow a distress would be
  levied. These things are not idle threats in Pant-street.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Dick?" a pleasant voice asked from the outer darkness.</p>

  <p>"Rent," Dick Stevenson said between his teeth. "Midday to-morrow. Our last
  anchor gone&mdash;'a poor thing, but mine own.'"</p>

  <p>Molly Stevenson groaned. It seemed dreadfully disloyal, but she had been
  wondering lately if Dick was the genius that they had both fondly imagined.
  They all used to be under this delusion in the old vicarage.</p>

  <p>Molly was to be a great artist, and Dick to combine Scott and Dickens and
  a few great lights of fiction. The streets of London were paved with gold,
  and so those noble-hearted, simple young folks walked into it hand in hand
  two years ago, since which time&mdash;</p>

  <p>But that is an old story, and has been told time out of mind. The prosaic
  fact was three pounds twelve shillings were due for rent, and that, if the
  sum was not paid by high noon to-morrow, two struggling geniuses would be
  turned into the street.</p>

  <p>"Could you possibly get that money from 'The Record?'" Molly asked.</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head. 'The Record' only paid on Fridays, it was nearly ten
  o'clock, and the business manager of the morning journal in question would
  have gone home before now. Moreover, he was a member of the firm who left a
  great deal to his well-trained subordinates.</p>

  <p>"It is nearly six pounds, Molly," Dick said, "a little stroke of luck that
  came just in the nick of time between ourselves and the workhouse. Still I'll
  try it."</p>

  <p>They were busy enough in the office of "The Record." A score of pale-faced
  clerks were slaving away under the brilliant bands of light thrown by the
  electrics. Without looking up, a cashier asked Stevenson's business.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Spencer gone for the day," was the quick reply. "Won't be back till
  Friday, anyway. Account? Let me see. There was an account passed for
  you&mdash;six pounds odd. Get it on Friday in due course."</p>

  <p>"If I could only have it now?"</p>

  <p>"Rubbish. We don't do business like that, as you ought to know by this
  time. If I paid that I should get myself into trouble."</p>

  <p>Dick turned heavily away. The cashier was not to blame, he was a mere
  machine in the office. As Dick passed into the street somebody followed
  him.</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully sorry," he stammered, "but you see I recognised you, Mr.
  Stevenson. My father was head gardener at Stanmere, and many a kindness we
  used to get from the rector and your mother. Are you&mdash;er, are
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The bright eyed lad hesitated in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Hard up," Dick said, grimly. "I recognise you now, young Williams. How
  about those Ribstone Pippins that his lordship&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please don't jest with me," the other said, imploringly. "I came out to
  tell you that Mr. Spencer has gone home. His address is 117 Cambria
  Square&mdash;he has one of those big flats there. If you go and see Mr.
  Spencer and tell him exactly how you stand, he will give you an order on the
  counting-house at once. Mr. Spencer will do anything for anybody."</p>

  <p>"That's very good of you," Dick said, gratefully. "As it happens, I have
  never seen Mr. Spencer. What is he like?"</p>

  <p>"Tall and spare, with a long grey beard. He's an enormously rich man, and
  practically our paper belongs to him. He never goes out in the daytime
  because he has something queer the matter with his eyes. During the year I
  have been in the office I have never seen him in the daytime."</p>

  <p>Apparently Mr. Spencer of 'The Record' was a difficult person to find. It
  was a long time before the porter motioned Dick into the lift. Eventually a
  sombre-looking man in black livery conveyed him into a sitting-room, the
  solitary light of which was so shaded down that the intruder could see
  nothing but dim shadows. Presently out of these shadows loomed a tall figure,
  with the suggestion of a beard on his face.</p>

  <p>"You wished to see me," he said. His voice was kindly, but there was a
  strange note of agitation in it. There was no reason why this rich and
  powerful man should be frightened, but undoubtedly he was. "Your name is
  strange to me."</p>

  <p>Dick explained more or less incoherently. As he stumbled on nervously his
  almost unseen companion seemed to gain courage.</p>

  <p>"It's a dreadful liberty," Dick mumbled. "But my little home is all I
  have, and&mdash;and the money is owing to me, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you most assuredly shall have it," Mr. Spencer interrupted. "My
  secretary has unfortunately gone out, or I could give you a cheque now. But
  my card and a line or two on it will produce the money at the office. And if
  you call and see me there after nine to-morrow night I'll see what I can do
  for you."</p>

  <p>Dick murmured his thanks.</p>

  <p>The sudden kindness, the prospect of something beyond this terrible
  hand-to-mouth kind of existence, had thoroughly unhinged him. As he stood
  there, a little white-haired terrier trotted along the passage and sniffed at
  him with an eye to friendship. Dick stooped with a kindly pat, and the dog
  licked his hand.</p>

  <p>"Your coat is coming off, sir," Dick said, huskily. "Look at my trousers,
  the best pair I have, and between ourselves, doggie, the only pair. And all
  smothered with white hairs. And if the editor of 'The Times' sent for me
  suddenly, why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dick paused, conscious that he was talking pure nonsense. He was also
  conscious of the sudden opening of a door at the end of the corridor, a
  brilliant bath of light, and the figure of the most beautiful girl Dick had
  ever seen in his life. He was destined never to forget the perfect symmetry
  of that lovely face and the deep pathos of those dark blue eyes. A man came
  out, half turning to kiss the face of the girl, evidently previous to his
  departure.</p>

  <p>"Exquisite!" Dick muttered. "At the same time it strikes me that I am more
  or less playing the spy. There's an air of mystery about them that appeals to
  the novelist's imagination. Good-night, doggie!"</p>

  <p>He stooped down, gave the terrier a friendly pat, and was gone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; AN ADVENTURE IN THE SQUARE.</h2>

  <p>"You'll get on," the cashier said with grim admiration, as he glanced at
  Mr. Spencer's card with its few pencilled lines. "There's your money."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," Dick replied. "Would you mind giving me that card back? It's
  sentimental, of course, but I should like to keep it. And if I can do
  anything for you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, you can, as it happens. There's your card. There's a letter come
  for the governor which is marked urgent. I've got nobody I can send without
  inconvenience, and if it is not too much out of your way perhaps you will
  take it?"</p>

  <p>It was a little cooler now, a few drops of rain had fallen, but not more
  than sufficient to lay the dust. Cambria Square was getting dark, a brooding
  silence lay over the gardens. Dick delivered his letter to the surly hall
  porter, and then turned his face eastwards. A few drops of the late rain
  pattered from leaf to leaf; there was a pleasant smell of moist earth in the
  air. By shutting his eyes Dick could conjure up visions of Stanmere.</p>

  <p>The sound of hurried footsteps brought him to earth again. As he
  re-crossed to the pavement a tall figure, with streaming beard and white
  agitated face came round the corner almost into his arms. On the impulse of
  the moment Dick shot out a strong arm and detained him.</p>

  <p>"I hope there is nothing wrong, sir?" he asked, meaningly.</p>

  <p>The tall man with the beard paused and rubbed his eyes. He had every
  appearance of one who flies in his sleep from some terror.</p>

  <p>"Did you see anybody?" he whispered. "A man who had&mdash;but of course
  you didn't, the thing is utterly absurd. Sir, are you a man of
  imagination?"</p>

  <p>Dick replied that unless he possessed imagination, he had cruelty mistaken
  his vocation in life. The strange man with the wild air was utterly unknown
  to him, and yet there was something in his voice that was familiar. The
  terror was gradually dying from his face; he was growing sane and quiet
  again. It was a fine, broad, kindly face, but there was the shadow of some
  great trouble haunting the deep-set grey eyes.</p>

  <p>"I must have astonished you just now," he said. "As a matter or fact, I
  have had a great many years abroad. Sunstroke, you understand; since when I
  have never been quite the same. I can manage my property as well as anybody;
  for months I am quite myself, and then these attacks come suddenly. Always at
  night when I am alone in the dark; I come out to try and cure myself. At the
  same time, are you quite sure that you met nobody?"</p>

  <p>"If you would like," Dick suggested, "I shall be glad to walk a little
  way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The stranger replied somewhat curtly to the effect that there was no
  occasion for anything of the kind. He passed on with a steady step, leaving
  Dick to his more or less amused thoughts. Such a character might be useful to
  him in fiction. The whole facts of the case appealed to the young novelist's
  imagination. Here was a rich and prosperous man, envied and flattered and
  admired, who was constantly pursued by some haunting terror. Perhaps in the
  early days he had committed some great crime; perhaps some dreadful vengeance
  was hanging over his head.</p>

  <p>But the noble, kindly face belied all that. No doubt the explanation given
  was no more than the truth. The poor fellow suffered in that peculiar form,
  and he was doing his best to shame himself out of it.</p>

  <p>"I'll take another turn round the square," Dick said to himself. "It's
  foolish, but I am too restless to go home quite yet."</p>

  <p>It was very still there. Most of the lights were out in the staid houses
  by this time, a policeman clanked along and disappeared. Then a murmur of
  voices arose, the distant sound of laboured breathing, a shout and a
  strangled cry. It was all strange and dreamy for a moment, then the reality
  of tragedy flashed upon the listener. He might be in time to prevent outrage
  or worse.</p>

  <p>He turned the corner quickly. As he did so, his tall friend with the beard
  came along. He was running fast, with the free and easy stride of the
  athlete, running with an ease surprising in one of his time of life, his
  beard streaming in the breeze caused by his own swift motion. He was without
  a hat; there was a certain ferocious furtiveness in his eyes, but the broad,
  noble face had not changed. It was not the face of a man in terror now, but
  the face of one who flies from some crime.</p>

  <p>He dodged Dick, who stood to bar his progress, with the greatest ease. The
  smile on his face was of contempt. There was not the slightest sign of
  recognition on it. And Dick could have sworn that his late companion had worn
  a black tie, yet there he was again with a vivid red one.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the groans were still going on. Dick sped rapidly round the
  corner. The whole thing had happened so quickly that no time had been lost.
  Just by one of the pillars of the stout, square railings, was a patch of
  blood. From somewhere close by moaning could be heard.</p>

  <p>"Where are you?" Dick whispered.</p>

  <p>"Inside," came the reply. "When he struck me down I saw that there was
  somebody behind him. Then I turned and lifted up the second rail from the
  stone capital and crept inside here. It comes up from the bottom. You can get
  through that way."</p>

  <p>Dick staggered back. The voice was quite familiar to him. It sounded just
  like the voice of the dangerous lunatic he had encountered half an hour ago.
  But that could not be, seeing that the madman in question had just passed
  him, flying apparently for his life, in another direction.</p>

  <p>"I'll come to you," Dick Stammered. "It's quite safe."</p>

  <p>"You are quite sure that he has gone?"</p>

  <p>"Certain. He passed me running his best. Did you say the second rail? Yes,
  here it is. Now then."</p>

  <p>The railing slid back in its socket, leaving a space large enough to admit
  a human body. Dick squeezed through, until presently he could see the dim
  outline of a figure prostrate on the grass.</p>

  <p>"Are you very much hurt?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," said the strangely familiar voice. "A mere flesh wound. What's
  that?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I can judge, a belated policeman hurrying to the spot. Shall I
  call him?"</p>

  <p>Dick's arm was grasped with passionate force.</p>

  <p>"Not for worlds!" came a hoarse reply. "If you have any regard for more
  than one pure and innocent life you will be silent. Let the man search; he
  will find nothing. I found that loose rail by accident, and by this means I
  often come here late at night. Hush! that man is coming close."</p>

  <p>The flashing zones of light ceased, the beat of footsteps died away. All
  was still and quiet once again.</p>

  <p>"We can't stay here all night," Dick suggested.</p>

  <p>His companion staggered to his feet, Dick helping him into the roadway. He
  stood under the lamplight the most astonished young man in London, for his
  companion was the man with the grey beard and the kindly face.</p>

  <p>"You seem to be my guardian spirit to-night," he said, faintly.</p>

  <p>Dick had no reply. He was too dazed to think as yet.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; A VANISHED MEMORY.</h2>

  <p>"Tell me all about sir," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"I can tell you nothing whatever," said the other, still slinking with
  terror. "My mind has gone again, I only know that I have had a great shock,
  which is none the less terrible because I have been expecting it for years. I
  heard his step and ran. Put me in a crowd with a million people and I could
  pick out his step without hesitation."</p>

  <p>The speaker wiped the blood from his face. He was not very much hurt, only
  frightened to the verge of insanity. He was quivering all over like a reed
  shaken by the wind.</p>

  <p>"Why does this man pursue you?" Stevenson asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I have entirely forgotten. But I never forget his step and
  that I must fly when I hear it coming. You are a gentleman?"</p>

  <p>Dick modestly hoped so. The knowledge was one of the few consolations that
  remained to him. The old man looked long and earnestly into his pleasant,
  open face. It was some time before he spoke.</p>

  <p>"At present I know nothing," he said at length. "The terror has deprived
  me of my wits for the time being. To-morrow I shall be doing my business
  again as if nothing had happened. I ask you to leave me now, sir, and think
  no more of what you have seen and heard. Let it be a secret between us."</p>

  <p>"Provided that you let me see you home," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"No; I am going to walk about a little longer. Then it may come back to
  me. At present I could not tell you my address or even&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off abruptly, and regarded his companion with troubled eyes. The
  man had actually forgotten his name and address. It was utterly impossible
  for him to be left like this.</p>

  <p>"We'll speak to a policeman," Dick said, promptly.</p>

  <p>The terror shut down again, the deep-set eyes dilated.</p>

  <p>"No, no," he whispered; "anything but that. The police must not know. Do
  you want to ruin me utterly?"</p>

  <p>"Then I am going to take you home," Dick said, firmly. "Yours may be an
  exceedingly valuable life for all I know. Where do you live?"</p>

  <p>"As I hope for salvation I cannot tell you. It will come back to me
  presently, perhaps in a few minutes, two hours. But it will come back."</p>

  <p>"But surely your own name, sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have no more cognisance of it than I have of your own."</p>

  <p>The man spoke in evident sincerity. It was clear that he concealed
  nothing. All the time Dick wondered why his voice was so strangely familiar.
  But he had other things to occupy his attention. He must respect the old
  man's earnest prayer to keep the story from the police. At the same time, in
  his present demented condition, it was impossible to leave him to the mercy
  of the streets. It was a pretty puzzle for the young novelist. If this thing
  were a story, how would he have got out of the difficulty?</p>

  <p>"How long have you been out to-night?" he asked, tentatively.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. At present I don't know anything. There is only a vague
  impression that a beautiful girl with blue eyes is waiting for me anxiously.
  If you ask me who she is, I fancy it is my daughter."</p>

  <p>"Then the beautiful girl with the blue eyes shall not be disappointed,"
  said Stevenson, cheerfully. "I shall find a way out."</p>

  <p>He rubbed his coat sleeve thoughtfully. There was a little dampness on it
  from the effects of the recent spurt of rain, and Dick noticed that the
  clothing of his companion was perfectly dry. The rain had been over for
  nearly half an hour, therefore it was manifest the old man had quite recently
  left the house. He was not a fast walker, therefore he could not be far from
  home. The deduction was quite logical.</p>

  <p>"You came out after the rain?" Dick asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I went back, fearing that it would be heavy. It is too hot a night
  for one to wear an overcoat. Therefore I waited for the rain to stop."</p>

  <p>Something had been gained, at any rate. Stevenson studied his companion
  latently. On his dark coat he could see a number of short white hairs.</p>

  <p>"You keep a small fox-terrier dog?" he asked, with sudden inspiration.</p>

  <p>The other nodded. His memory seemed to be curiously patchy. The little
  things seemed with him, the great ones were gone. "A little fox-terrier
  called Ben," he said.</p>

  <p>With that Dick was fain to be content. Here he was saddled with a lunatic
  old gentleman in the streets of midnight London, and the only clue to the
  local habitation of his companion was that he possessed a dog called Ben.
  That master and dog were good friends Stevenson deduced from the hairs on his
  companion's clothing. What the novelist had to do now was to look for a house
  within a radius of a mile or so where there was a dog called Ben.</p>

  <p>It seemed slightly ridiculous, but Stevenson could think of no better plan
  than getting his companion to whistle and call the dog at intervals. If the
  worst came to the worst he could take his demented friend to his own humble
  abode and keep him there till morning. For some time it had been painfully
  apparent to Dick that he was faint for want of food. If he collapsed now
  there would be nothing for it but the nearest police station.</p>

  <p>"Whistle again," he said, dreamily. "Try once more."</p>

  <p>They were in Cambria Square now, near the large block of flats. The flats
  appeared to have several doors, for this one was not even on the same side as
  Stevenson entered an hour or two before. The old gentleman whistled softly,
  and called Ben by name for about the fiftieth time. There was a yelping and
  scratching behind the door, and a dog whining in joyful recognition.</p>

  <p>"Shades of the immortal Dupurin," Dick cried, "success at last. It is very
  certain that we have found your house, sir."</p>

  <p>With no fear of surly porter before his eyes, Dick opened the door.</p>

  <p>A little dog came bounding out and gyrated wildly. A hall porter appeared,
  and with the surly insolence of his kind demanded to know what was the
  matter.</p>

  <p>"This gentleman lives here, I think," Dick said. "He has had a nasty
  fall&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Second floor," the porter growled. "Lift's off for the night. Better take
  him up, sir. Telephone on next floor if you want a doctor."</p>

  <p>With a certain pardonable curiosity Dick led the way upstairs. So far as
  he could see there was only two sets of flats on the second floor, and one of
  them was obviously in the hands of the decorators. Therefore, there was only
  one alternative. Dick pushed into a corridor that seemed familiar to him, and
  boldly led the way into a drawing-room, where a girl was seated at the piano
  playing soft dreamy music.</p>

  <p>The room was bathed in electric light; there were wonderful works of art
  there&mdash;silver of Cellini, engravings after Romney and Reynolds, a Hopper
  or two, some marvellous old French furniture. But the most striking thing
  about the room were the marvellous masses of flowers everywhere. The whole
  place was a veritable bower of them, roses and lilies and violets. The mere
  arrangement of them was in itself a work of art.</p>

  <p>But Dick forgot the flowers a moment later as the girl turned her face
  towards him. It was the beautiful girl with the pathetic blue eyes he had
  seen two hours before. The intruder had not the least doubt about this, that
  face and those eyes were too indelibly printed on his mind for that.</p>

  <p>The girl came forward without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"I have been anxious about you," she cried. "Father, you have had one of
  your bad turns, I could hear that by your step as you came upstairs. And this
  gentleman has brought you home, though he is tired and utterly worn out
  himself."</p>

  <p>"It is good of you to think of me," Dick stammered; "but how could you
  possibly know that I am&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Starving, he was about to say, but stopped in time. The girl laughed with
  a rippling music that filled the room.</p>

  <p>"I have the gift of second sight," she said. Though her face was wreathed
  in smiles, the great blue eyes never laughed, but ever remained so strangely
  pathetic. "Only a man utterly worn out would walk as you do. And you are
  quite young, too. You must have something to eat at once."</p>

  <p>She crossed the room and rang the bell. Dick watched her graceful motions
  with a pleasure that was almost akin to pain.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; "I KNOW HER."</h2>

  <p>A servant or two came and went as if an order for a midnight supper was a
  matter of course, then there came a stolid looking man with a Teutonic face,
  who took the host away like a prisoner in custody.</p>

  <p>"My father will be better presently," the girl said. "He is subject to
  strange lapses of memory. Kant's system of treatment never fails to benefit
  him. Now, will you please to have some supper, Mr.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My name is Richard Stevenson," Dick said. "I was in the building some
  time ago, and I had the pleasure of seeing you before, Miss&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Call me Miss Mary. That is the only name I have. As I have no friends and
  never see anybody, my name cannot matter. Also, as I have the strongest
  possible reasons for disliking my own, I am always Miss Mary. Now, will you
  please eat your supper without further delay?"</p>

  <p>It was delicious, especially to a man who had long been a stranger to
  daintily-served, well-cooked food. The chicken and ham were perfect, the
  lettuce crisp and cool, and the claret soft and velvety to the taste. It was
  a different man who rose from the table presently.</p>

  <p>"You must finish the claret," Mary said. "You have only had one glass. Are
  there not some cigarettes on the table there?"</p>

  <p>Dick could not see any. Mary advanced to find them. Her long, slim fingers
  seemed to caress everything that she touched.</p>

  <p>"Surely they are on the far corner by your left hand," Dick suggested.</p>

  <p>For some reason the girl blushed deeply.</p>

  <p>"Then they have been moved," she said. "I cannot find them. I don't like
  things to be moved. It upsets all my scheme of memory. I always boast that I
  can see anything in the room, and when the servants&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is your eye-sight deficient?" Dick asked.</p>

  <p>"I have no eye-sight," came the quiet reply. "I am stone-blind."</p>

  <p>Dick was utterly shocked. This was the last thing in the world that he had
  expected. Those great blue eyes were very pathetic and sorrowful; but they
  looked so pure and clear and liquid. He stammered an apology.</p>

  <p>"I am so deeply sorry," he said. "But you see I could not possibly know.
  And you seemed to see me when I came in, you moved so freely, and you
  actually knew that I had taken only one glass of claret."</p>

  <p>"That is because my hearing is so good," Mary replied. "One instinctively
  trains one sense to take the place of the missing one. I can deduce a great
  deal by the way people walk. And I have lived almost entirely in this and my
  bedroom for many years. Really, so far as this room is concerned, I can see.
  I know where everything is, I can tell you what flowers there are in this and
  that vase, though there are scores of them. I was not always blind."</p>

  <p>Dick lingered on, feeling that he ought to go. The feeling became more
  absolute when the Teutonic servant came in with the information that his
  master was much better, and had gone to bed. He hinted that under the
  circumstances his kind young friend would excuse him. The dismissal was
  polite enough, but it was none the less complete and final. There was even no
  excuse left for calling.</p>

  <p>"We are very quiet people," Mary said, as if she could actually read the
  thoughts of her visitor. "Believe me, I am more than grateful for your
  kindness to-night. You are a gentleman, and you will understand."</p>

  <p>She came forward and held out her hand. Dick held it with a certain
  longing at his heart. The pathetic beauty of that sightless face stirred him
  strangely. It was not Mary's beauty alone, but her helplessness, that moved
  him. And she seemed to be utterly lonely.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," he said; "there need be no obligation on your side.
  Good-night."</p>

  <p>"Good-night, and a thousand thanks. Do you like flowers as well as I do?
  Let me give you a few of my favorite violets."</p>

  <p>She walked rapidly to a vase and took out a fragrant mass of purple bloom.
  Without the slightest hesitation she picked up an envelope&mdash;one of the
  transparent grease-proof kind that proofs of photographs are sent
  in&mdash;and placed the blossoms in it.</p>

  <p>It seemed hard to credit the fact that she was sightless.</p>

  <p>"There!" she said, quite gaily. "A little trifle to remember me by.
  Good-night."</p>

  <p>Dick was well out into the square before he could think of a suitable
  reply. Truly it had been a night of strange adventures. Not the least strange
  thing was that the scene of these happenings had been all in the Cambria
  Square flats. Stevenson felt strangely alert and wide awake as he put his
  latchkey in the door.</p>

  <p>Molly was awaiting him anxiously. She looked almost pitifully into his
  cheerful face.</p>

  <p>"I began to imagine all sorts of dreadful things," she said. "You have
  never been out so late before without letting me know. When you have had your
  supper&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dick stooped and kissed the pretty speaker. Really, Molly was a very
  pretty girl with her delicate coloring and high-bred face.</p>

  <p>"Thoughtful girl," he said. "Always thinking of others first. My dear
  Molly, I have supped on superb chicken and salad and claret, such as Ouida's
  guardsmen would not disdain to drink. I partook of it in a perfect bower of
  bliss filled with flowers and priceless works of art, and in the company of
  the most lovely girl I have ever seen in all my life. I walked into the
  prosaic streets of London and suddenly found myself plunged into the Arabian
  Nights."</p>

  <p>"Always in good spirits," Molly murmured. "But to be more practical. There
  is nothing of the Haroun al Raschid about our landlord."</p>

  <p>"The landlord will be paid, Molly. I took my courage in both hands and
  went to see Mr. Spencer. He gave me an order for the money, which is at
  present in my pocket, and, what is more, he asked me to call upon him
  to-morrow night, when he as good as promised me regular work to do. Think of
  it, Molly; a cottage in the country where we can breathe the pure air and
  grow our own flowers."</p>

  <p>Molly began to cry quietly. Not even good kind old Dick knew what she had
  suffered here. She wiped her eyes presently and called herself a goose.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I'm run down," she said, in extenuation. "And now tell me all
  about those wonderful adventures of yours."</p>

  <p>Dick launched out into a graphic account of all that he had seen or heard.
  Molly's pretty face was aglow with interest. She had never heard anything
  like it before out of the pages of a book. She took the packet of violets
  presently and quietly removed them from the envelope.</p>

  <p>"Why, there is something inside here!" she cried.</p>

  <p>It was the proof of a photograph still unmounted. A pretty girl with great
  pathetic eyes, taken with a background of palms and flowers.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's Miss Mary herself," Dick cried. "The photo must have been taken
  in the Cambria square drawing-room, and this odd proof must have escaped
  attention in the envelope. Now tell me candidly, Molly, did you ever see a
  more lovely face in all your life?"</p>

  <p>Molly looked up with a dazed expression.</p>

  <p>"Why, I know her," she whispered. "I recognised her in a moment. You have
  heard me speak of my old schoolfellow, Mary Gay."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE MOTH CATCHER.</h2>

  <p>Dick Stevenson nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>"I shall make a capital story out of this," he said. "One smiles at this
  kind of thing in books, and yet more remarkable events are chronicled in the
  papers every day. But isn't she lovely, Molly?"</p>

  <p>Molly laid the photograph carefully on the table. The more she looked at
  it the more she was drawn and fascinated.</p>

  <p>"It is a pretty episode," she said, "but only an episode, after all. I
  don't see how you are going to follow up the acquaintance, Dick. The poor
  girl is blind, and never goes out; the way you were dismissed was a pretty
  strong hint not to call again. And yet I should like to see Mary once
  more."</p>

  <p>In his heart of hearts Dick was telling himself that this thing should be
  done. What was the use of being an author with all a novelist's imagination
  if one could not scheme some ingenious plan or other? He lighted a cigarette
  over the evil-smelling lamp with a thoughtful air. Somebody was knocking at
  the door.</p>

  <p>"Come in," Molly said; "it can be nobody but Herr Greigstein."</p>

  <p>A small, stout man, with close-cut hair and enormous moustache came into
  the room. He had a high, broad forehead and a magnificent pair of flashing
  eyes that seemed to be marred by spectacles. There was a suggestion of power
  about this man of strong intellectual force and determination. For the most
  part he was smiling and loquacious; he possessed a boyish flow of animal
  spirits, belied now and again by a quick-flashing glance, and a gathering of
  deep-set eyebrows. For the rest, Max Greigstein was a lodger on the top floor
  of the Pant-street house, and he was generally supposed to be a German master
  in a North London school.</p>

  <p>"I am late," he said, breezily, "but I come with news of the best. You
  remember, Herr Dick, I give you certain information about German anarchists
  in London. You put him in the form of some articles for a friend of mine, who
  has a paper in Berlin. My friend, he sends me eleven pounds for those pen
  pictures and asks, like Oliver Twist, for more, therefore, we divide the
  money as arranged, and when landlord he come to-morrow he grovel and eat dust
  before you. Behold, the little fairies that make sad hearts light!"</p>

  <p>With something of the air of a conjurer and something of his swiftness,
  Greigstein laid some gold coins on the little table. His tongue had no pause,
  his restless dark eyes seemed as if seeking for something. For all his
  friendship and his many little kindnesses, Dick rather disliked Greigstein.
  He admitted the fact with shame, but there it was. He knew the little German
  scientist to be miserably poor; still he had played the good fairy like this
  often before.</p>

  <p>"Here is the beginning of fame and fortune," he cried. "You grow rich, you
  marry a beautiful and talented young lady, and in the course of
  time&mdash;Gott in Himmel, what is this? where did it come from?"</p>

  <p>The man's whole manner changed, there was quick command in his tone. He
  laid a strong brown finger on the photograph lying upwards on the table. He
  might have been a general who finds a fault in some strategic scheme, a
  lawyer who at length finds the weak spot in the witness's armor. His eyes
  flashed with strange brilliancy behind his glasses.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you," Dick said coldly. "That proof came into my hands by
  the merest accident. It is no business of mine&mdash;or yours."</p>

  <p>Greigstein waved the whole thing aside with a quick motion of his hand.
  The next moment he was chatting gaily of moths and butterflies. It was his
  own great hobby&mdash;that and science. There was a new moth that Dick must
  see, a new moth captured in the gardens of a London square.</p>

  <p>"I catch him in a square," he cried excitedly. "I make friends with all
  the square keepers for miles around, and they let me go into the gardens when
  the world is dark and quiet. And I get my new moth. I take him to South
  Kensington, and they say he is but, Callimorpha Lecontei. Ach, the
  fools!"</p>

  <p>Dick listened more or less vaguely. He had heard all about those nocturnal
  rambles before.</p>

  <p>"Some day you listen to my theories," Greigstein rabbled on. It seemed to
  Dick that he was keeping his eyes too scrupulously averted from the table and
  the photograph. "Again there was the new clouded moth which I found at
  Stanmere. Some day, if I am lucky, I retire to Stanmere. It is the paradise
  of the entomologist. Herr Dick, do you know that I was at Stanmere last
  week?"</p>

  <p>"You were lucky," Dick said, with a sigh.</p>

  <p>"Even so, I was on the lake. The family were away from home. Strange that
  I should come and take rooms under the very roof of young people who had been
  born and bred at Stanmere. There are no dragon-flies like those on the lake
  yonder. I should never tire of Stanmere."</p>

  <p>"I may never see the dear old place again," Dick said, regretfully. "I'd
  give a great deal to have a month there now, to lie in the bracken under the
  old park oaks, or to drift amongst the water-lilies in a punt. Fancy having a
  day with those trout once more! My good friend, if you don't stop talking
  about Stanmere at once, I shall be constrained to throw a book at you."</p>

  <p>Greigstein would take himself off at once. It was getting very late, and
  he had some work to do before he went to bed. Meanwhile, would Herr Dick do
  some more of those brilliant articles? In a whirl of words the German
  departed, leaving his spectacles behind him. Dick noticed them presently.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe he wants glasses at all," he said. "He is a Socialist.
  Meanwhile, I'll take his glasses, lest he should come back again. I'm too
  tired to swim in another sea of words to-night."</p>

  <p>Dick slipped quietly up the stairs of the quiet house. Greigstein's
  bedroom was slightly open, and Dick looked in. The gas was lighted by the
  dressing-table. The German stood there in immaculate evening dress, his
  moustaches waxed. To Dick's utter astonishment he saw that across the broad
  glistening expanse of shirtfront was a riband, and round the powerful throat
  a jewelled order was suspended. A silk-lined evening cloak lay across a
  chair.</p>

  <p>Dick softly retired with the spectacles in his pocket. He heard the front
  door close presently, and footsteps going down the street. And on the table
  lay the photograph of the girl with the sad blue eyes!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE RESTORED PHOTOGRAPH.</h2>

  <p>When Dick came down to breakfast Greigstein had departed, ostensibly on
  his scholastic duties. He had come in for the missing spectacles, Molly said.
  He had professed himself to be quite lost without them.</p>

  <p>"That's all rubbish," Dick said, unfeelingly. "The fellow has no need for
  glasses. You may shake your head, Molly, but I will prove it to you."</p>

  <p>In a few words Dick told the story of his discovery. Molly scented
  romance. They had evidently made the acquaintance of a disguised German
  nobleman.</p>

  <p>"More likely a police spy," Dick laughed. "You need not go, Molly; I
  couldn't possibly do any work this morning. With that fateful interview with
  Mr. Spencer, of 'The Record,' before my eyes, I couldn't do a stroke."</p>

  <p>He presently wandered out aimlessly. Though he had risen very late, the
  day seemed to drag on. It was hot, and the streets shimmered in the sunshine.
  Dick took a very frugal lunch at a cheap restaurant, and then turned for
  distraction to the early edition of the evening papers. The 'St. James's
  Gazette' and 'Pall Mall' and 'Globe' seemed to have nothing in them that he
  had not seen before. Over his cigarette he fell back on the
  advertisements.</p>

  <p>There was something interesting at last. Dick recognised with a thrill
  that it concerned himself. It was in the agony column of 'The Globe.'</p>

  <p>"Will the gentleman who took from 117 Cambria Square, last night, the
  proof of a photograph accidentally left in an envelope containing violets,
  kindly return the same to the above address without delay?"</p>

  <p>Here was something to do at any rate. And, better than that, here was a
  good chance of seeing the girl with the pathetic eyes again. It would be a
  wrench to give up the photograph, but that would have to be done in any case.
  The precious picture was carefully stowed away in Dick's pocket-book.</p>

  <p>He hurried off in the direction of Cambria Square. Not till he found
  himself confronted by the hall porter did he recollect that he had not the
  faintest idea whom to ask for.</p>

  <p>"There is an advertisement in an evening paper," he stammered. "I was here
  last night; I had the good fortune to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's alright," the porter cut Dick short. "One of the servants told me
  in case anybody called. If you've got the photo, sir, I'll take it up."</p>

  <p>Dick hesitated. He had looked forward to something more romantic than
  this. He might be allowed to go up, he suggested, but the porter cut him
  short again by touching a bell and growling something hoarsely up a tube. In
  response the broad-faced, Teutonic-looking man who had acted as a kind of
  nurse to Dick's strange acquaintance of the night before, came down in the
  lift and touched his forehead respectfully.</p>

  <p>"My mistress expected you, sir," he said. "You have the photograph?"</p>

  <p>Dick could not deny it. He produced the picture grudgingly. It was absurd,
  of course, but it was a wrench to hand it over.</p>

  <p>"My mistress has been in great distress," the German said. "I will not
  disguise from you, sir, that my employer has moods when he is not quite
  responsible for his actions. You found him last night in one of them. He has
  outbreaks over other things. For instance, my young lady thought she would
  like to surprise her father by having her photograph taken. There was but one
  proof, and only one plate exposed. I have rarely seen my employer so terribly
  upset over anything, which was strange, considering that the photograph was
  actually taken in the house. My young lady promised to destroy the proof, but
  by mistake she left it in the photographer's envelope. She found that out
  early this morning. She is greatly desirous that you will say nothing of what
  has happened."</p>

  <p>"Of course not," Dick replied.</p>

  <p>The mystery was getting deeper.</p>

  <p>"If I may take the liberty of seeing her for a few moments&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No," the other said, with a cold curtness that brought the blood into
  Dick's face. "It is absolutely impossible. You must not come here again. I do
  not wish to be rude, sir, only I would urge you, both for your own sake and
  the sake of others, not to come here again."</p>

  <p>Mr. Spencer had not yet arrived when he reached the counting-house. His
  young friend of the previous night gave him an encouraging smile. Presently
  Dick found himself waiting nervously in an outer office, where the lad who
  had previously given him Mr. Spencer's address had ushered him.</p>

  <p>"Just a moment," Dick said, hurriedly. "Can you tell me anything about
  your chief? I only saw him in the dark last night."</p>

  <p>"That is a peculiarity of his," the young clerk replied. "He often does
  that when he sees strangers here. It is some fad of his of judging people by
  their voices. But as he has met you once he won't do that again. Another
  peculiarity is that he never comes here till dusk. Not one of us ever saw Mr.
  Spencer here in the daytime."</p>

  <p>"But you find him a good and kind employer?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, very. He is the right class of philanthropist. He never appears to,
  and yet he does a tremendous deal of good. If he takes a fancy to you it is
  your own fault if you don't succeed here. He never spoke to me for months,
  and then I found that he knew all my affairs, and what my father was, and all
  about my home at Stanmere, and everything. There's his bell."</p>

  <p>The speaker turned away, to return a moment later with the information
  that Mr. Spencer was ready to see his visitor. It was a small, dark-papered
  room, with one brilliant light gleaming on a little table covered with paper.
  A man sat there who looked up and smiled at Dick genially, then he looked
  down again, as if giving his visitor time to recover himself.</p>

  <p>It was as well that he did, well that he failed to see the blank amazement
  on the face of Dick Stevenson. He placed his hands on the back of his chair
  to steady himself from falling. For there, seated opposite him, as if utterly
  unconscious that anything out of the common had happened, was the very man
  whose life Dick had saved in Cambria Square last night.</p>

  <p>Could it be acting? No, it was impossible. The man by the table evidently
  had not the faintest idea that he and Dick met before. This kindly
  noble-looking face was calm and placid. Evidently the events of last night
  had been absolutely and entirely wiped from his memory.</p>

  <p>"Are you unwell?" he asked, in a considerate tone. "I am afraid you are in
  trouble. If you will only make a friend of me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A passing faintness," Dick stammered. "A queer lapse of memory."</p>

  <p>Mr. Spencer looked up, a feeling expression dimmed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I understand," he said. "Nobody better. I am occasionally troubled by the
  same thing myself. My dear boy, pray sit down and let us get to
  business."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; GREIGSTEIN.</h2>

  <p>The keen eye of a detective would have noticed certain anomalies in Herr
  Max Greigstein's modest sitting-room. For instance, the table linen was very
  fine, the cutlery and plate, which the German preferred to clean himself,
  were of silver and fine steel mounted on ivory. These are things not
  unusually found in obscure bed-sitting rooms at nine shillings a week, and
  though the once exclusive cigarette is now given over to the multitude, they
  do not usually smoke a 'Nestor' at eleven shillings a hundred, such as
  Greigstein had between his lips at present.</p>

  <p>The modest breakfast things were pushed away, and Greigstein was frowning
  over his ruminative cigarette. There was an excuse for his laziness this
  morning, as he had no scholastic engagement on Saturday. Greigstein was
  thinking aloud&mdash;a favorite habit of his&mdash;but the door was
  closed.</p>

  <p>"You are a fool," he told himself, "you think you have yourself well in
  hand, but that is where you make the mistake. Come, why did you let Dick
  Stevenson see that you were interested in that photograph?"</p>

  <p>Greigstein frowned at himself in a little mirror opposite.</p>

  <p>"That is a clever boy," he went on, "he has intuition. Only he has the bad
  taste not to like Herr Greigstein. He will tell me nothing about the original
  of that fascinating photo. With a lad of meaner instincts I should try
  bribery. But I shall find out, yes, I shall find out."</p>

  <p>There was a gleam in Greigstein's eyes as he spoke. A moment later he was
  deeply engrossed in his cases of moths and butterflies as if they were of
  all-absorbing interest. Then he put his breakfast things outside the door and
  locked it after him. He carried a net and a specimen case with the simple air
  of a man who is going on an innocent holiday. The door of Stevenson's
  sitting-room was open.</p>

  <p>"May I come in?" Greigstein asked, and entered the room without waiting
  for a reply. "What is the news, my young hero? Good, I imagine, by the
  expression of your face. That interview with the newspaper magnate, for
  instance. In my mind's eye I can see Dick Stevenson, editor of 'The
  Times.'"</p>

  <p>Greigstein's glasses twinkled as he spoke, and Dick was disarmed. He was
  in a mood to be charmed with all the world this morning. The stuffy,
  evil-smelling rooms in Pant-street would soon be a thing of the past. Already
  there were visions of a charming house in the country presided over by a
  sweet-faced, blue-eyed girl who was none the less beloved because she was
  blind.</p>

  <p>"Three hundred a year," Dick said, with a poor assumption of indifference;
  "I have got an appointment on the literary staff of 'The Record.' And I shall
  have plenty of time for my fiction writing besides. It isn't very often that
  one gets a good appointment and an excellent plot of a strong novel in one
  week."</p>

  <p>Greigstein's congratulations were obviously sincere. At the same time
  there was a strange gleam behind his spectacles. There was a story here that
  the German was anxious to know, otherwise Dick would have said nothing about
  the plot of a novel. Greigstein passed his cigarette case across the
  table.</p>

  <p>"I should like to hear more of your good fortune," he said, quietly. "I am
  glad for your sake and the sake of your charming and most courageous sister.
  So your good fortune was the result of an adventure?"</p>

  <p>"Who told you so?" Dick asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Why, you did yourself. You say it is not often one gets a good
  appointment and a good plot in the same week. Obviously, the good fortune in
  your case follows the good plot&mdash;the adventure, that is. That is the
  way, my good friend, to write a good novel. Personal experience, nothing like
  personal experience. I should like very much to hear all about those personal
  experiences. Now my butterflies&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind the butterflies," Dick said, hastily; falling into the trap
  that Greigstein had laid for him. "But I'll tell you my adventure if you
  like."</p>

  <p>Not all of it, Greigstein told himself. For instance, he knew perfectly
  well that he would hear nothing as to the photograph and its charming
  original, and in this the German was perfectly right, for Mary Gay was not
  mentioned.</p>

  <p>"I think I have really interested you," Dick said, presently.</p>

  <p>Greigstein nodded. Dick would have been fairly startled to know how deeply
  his companion was interested. All the same, he had wisely said nothing as to
  the identity between Mr. Spencer and the excited stranger in Cambria Square.
  It was this half-truth that so sorely puzzled Greigstein and led him into so
  wide a labyrinth later on.</p>

  <p>"And where did all this happen?" Greigstein asked, vaguely. "Cambria
  Square? Ah, I got a magnificent specimen of the silver-haired moth there a
  week or two ago. Your friend was a friend of Mr. Spencer, then, and thus your
  new appointment?"</p>

  <p>"You may put it that way with truth," Dick replied, with a feeling that he
  had better have kept the whole story to himself. At any rate, he had
  concealed the fact that his benefactor was one of the actors in the strange
  drama. "Now, you can give me a clue to the real situation? For the purpose of
  fiction, I want to know why two men should act in so strange a manner."</p>

  <p>Greigstein laughed, and professed the matter to be entirely beyond him.
  His face expressed a pleased and amiable curiosity. Yet he passed a hand over
  his face to conceal the strange, quick quivering of his lips.</p>

  <p>"Alas! I am no novelist," he cried. "That you must work out for yourself,
  young Dick. And now I must be going. To-day is a holiday for me; I get away
  from those dreadful boys and forget that I am a mere drudge who imparts a
  mother tongue for a mere pittance."</p>

  <p>He slipped out of the room with a thoughtful expression on his face. He
  saw nothing of the crowded streets; he pushed along mechanically.</p>

  <p>"So they are both close at hand," he said to himself; "the one fleeing
  from a phantom the other pursuing an empty vengeance! And my young friend
  blunders into them and he finds the girl as well! Well, everything comes to
  the man who can afford to wait. On the whole, I can do no better than go down
  to Stanmere."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; ONE OF THE STATELY HOMES OF ENGLAND.</h2>

  <p>There are some fine houses in the Thames Valley between Oxford and
  Windsor, but none of greater beauty than Stanmere. It is not large, but it is
  pure Tudor, with never so much as a stone or window restored; its grey gables
  are softened and beautified by the hand of time; the velvet lawns have been
  rolled and shaven and shaven and rolled for three centuries. But the beauty
  of the place lies in its grounds.</p>

  <p>There are green terraces slipping to a lake which is fed by a strong
  stream. The lake is dotted with islands and surrounded by woods at the far
  end, which renders it dark and gloomy. There is a summer-house with steps
  leading down to the water, and here Lady Stanmere spends a deal of her time
  in the warm weather.</p>

  <p>The great green woods are wonderfully cool and silent; the great dragon
  flies hover over the still water, covered here and there by sheets of white
  water-lilies; the paths all around are of grass, and behind them are yews cut
  into fantastic shapes like a stone cloister turned into living green. Withal
  the peace and silence is very mournful, as if some tragedy brooded here.</p>

  <p>And in sooth there had been trouble enough and to spare at Stanmere. Lady
  Stanmere had lived to see her husband taken out of the placid lake where the
  dragon flies were brooding, and laid in what was no better than a suicide's
  grave; she had lived to see one son an outlaw and the other a nameless
  wanderer, until she could do no more than marvel at the amount of suffering
  she could endure and yet retain her reason. And here she was now,
  white-haired, broken, gentle, yet with some gleams of the once haughty spirit
  that had sustained her in the dark years of her life.</p>

  <p>But this was not all the mystery. Whom the property would go to when Lady
  Stanmere no longer needed it nobody knew, save, perhaps, Mr. Martlett, the
  family lawyer, who was never yet known to tell anything to a soul. For all
  Lady Stanmere knew, both her sons were dead, and they might or might not have
  left a son behind them. And the mystery was rendered deeper by the fact that
  the last of the reigning Stanmeres had left his property hopelessly
  encumbered and had died heavily in debt. It was not an extravagant household,
  for Lady Stanmere's wants were simple; but the grounds were superb, and a
  small army of gardeners were required to keep them trim in the beautiful
  order for which they had always been famous.</p>

  <p>Yet, despite debt and difficulty, everything was going on just the same as
  usual. The orchard houses and the vineries poured out their purple and golden
  harvest, the green lawns and the luxurious gardens were as trim and riotous
  as ever, not a single boy was discharged. And from time to time the thin,
  dried-up little Martlett presented certain papers for Lady Stanmere to sign,
  and with a cough that defied question, stated that this or that further
  mortgage had been paid off. A wonderful manager, Martlett, people said. But
  Martlett was dumb as an oyster.</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere sat in the summer-house overlooking the lake, her long slim
  hands engaged in some pretty silk meshwork upon which she was constantly
  engaged. Those long slim hands were never still for long together.</p>

  <p>She had been tall and straight once, now she was bent and broken. Yet the
  dark eyes in the pale face could flash at times, and the old imperious ring
  came back into the gentle voice. For a long space the hands with their
  flashing rings went in and out of the silken web. A gorgeous butterfly
  hovered round the honeysuckle over the porch.</p>

  <p>"Ah, my beauty," a deep voice said. "So I've got you now!"</p>

  <p>At the sound of that voice the black netting fell a tangled heap into Lady
  Stanmere's lap. A queer little cry escaped her. There was something like fear
  in her eyes, and yet not so much fear as agonised expectation. With a great
  effort she composed herself and walked to the entrance of the
  summer-house.</p>

  <p>"Von Wrangel," she said, firmly, "I'm surprised, I am ashamed of you. Put
  that net down and come and tell me what you want here."</p>

  <p>Greigstein dropped his net instantly, not without a passing look of regret
  for the great purple butterfly still hovering over the honeysuckle. His
  manner changed so utterly that his friends would hardly have recognised him.
  Plainly as he was dressed, there was no suggestion of the suburban
  schoolmaster about him now. His English had become singularly good and
  clearly enunciated.</p>

  <p>"I am exceedingly sorry, dear Lady Stanmere; I had not the remotest idea
  that you were here. I came down to see you to-day, though I have been here
  for years on and off without any attempt to do so. I was trying to think out
  some way of seeing you without coming up to the house, but the sight of that
  superb cassiopa&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Still the same strange contradiction," Lady Stanmere cried. "Still turned
  from great ends by the trivialities of life. But you may come in; there is no
  chance of our being interrupted here. Have you any news for me?"</p>

  <p>Greigstein followed into the grateful coolness of the summer-house. All
  the hardness had died out of his eyes, his manner was gentle, almost
  subservient.</p>

  <p>"I believe you have forgiven me," he said.</p>

  <p>"I believe that I have forgiven everybody," Lady Stanmere replied, "even a
  Hungarian patriot like yourself. My husband ruined himself and died for your
  wild scheme; my son Stephen is an outcast in fear of his life&mdash;if indeed
  he still lives&mdash;for the same cause."</p>

  <p>"Stephen was bound to have an outlet for his tremendous energies,"
  Greigstein said, coolly. "If he had not taken up the cause he would have
  given way to drink and gambling and such like evils, and I never countenanced
  violence. Remember that I am a disgraced and broken man because I stood
  between Stephen and the grip of the law."</p>

  <p>There was just a flash in the speaker's eyes for a moment, the glance that
  one might see on the face of a great general in the hour of misfortune. Lady
  Stanmere laid her hand with a pretty gesture on his arm.</p>

  <p>"I did not mean to wound you," she said gently. "And I must not hold you
  responsible for the wild blood of the Gays. It is only because I am so
  utterly lonely, because I have none of my own kith and kin to love that I
  find myself regretting that you ever came to remind me that my mother was a
  Von Wrangel. You recall our last meeting?"</p>

  <p>"'Shall I ever forget it?" Greigstein asked, in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Well, we need not go into that, it is three years ago. My boys I never
  hoped to see again. But Mary was another matter. You were to find her for me,
  you were not to come again until you did so. And when I heard your voice just
  now my heart&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know, I know," Greigstein murmured sympathetically, "that was the
  promise. Now tell me the story of the girl's disappearance."</p>

  <p>"A mystery," Lady Stanmere cried, "like everything connected with this
  house. She came mysteriously, late at night, with a brief note to the effect
  that her father's life was in danger and that I was to give her shelter. I
  can see her now, as she stood in the hall with those beautiful sightless blue
  eyes turned on me intuitively. She knew nothing, she could tell me nothing
  except that her father was alive. And I took her to my starved heart; and for
  two years I was quite happy."</p>

  <p>A tear or two stood in Lady Stanmere's eyes. Greigstein lifted her hand to
  his lips and kissed it.</p>

  <p>"Then, I understand she disappeared again," he said.</p>

  <p>"As mysteriously as she came. She went for a walk in the park, a walk that
  she had learnt by heart. She never came back again, but an hour or two
  afterwards a stranger left a card for me, saying Mary had gone, and that as I
  valued the peace and future of our house I was to do nothing."</p>

  <p>"And you consulted old Martlett, of course?"</p>

  <p>"I did. His advice to me was to do just as I was told. What could a
  helpless old woman like myself, strangled in these mysteries, do? But if you
  know anything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know something, but not much. Accident has placed a clue in my hands.
  For reasons which will be obvious to you, I am in humble guise in London at
  present. My single room is in Pant-street, from which charming locality I go
  to teach German in a school. Beneath me lodge a charming young couple, by
  name Stevenson. They are the son and daughter of the late vicar here."</p>

  <p>"This is very interesting," Lady Stanmere murmured.</p>

  <p>"So it occurred to me. I have made friends with these young people. I have
  even put money in their way, for they are very poor. Now, tell me, did these
  Stevensons know your niece by any chance?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see how they possibly could," Lady Stanmere said, thoughtfully,
  "seeing that they left the vicarage some time before Mary first arrived
  here."</p>

  <p>"Which only serves to heighten the mystery and make it more interesting,"
  Greigstein replied. "Now, a few nights ago, young Stevenson had a queer sort
  of adventure. There can be no doubt that he was in close contact with both
  your&mdash;but we need not go into that."</p>

  <p>Greigstein paused in some confusion. There was just a gleam of suspicion
  and anger in the glance that Lady Stanmere gave him.</p>

  <p>"You are concealing something from me," she said.</p>

  <p>"Well, I am," Greigstein replied, coolly. "With your gracious permission I
  propose to go on doing so for the present. Now, young Stevenson told me part
  of the adventure. He little guessed what a mine of information he had tapped
  for me. Mixed up in that adventure was a photograph. I saw that photograph
  with my own eyes. And it was a photography quite recently taken of your niece
  Mary."</p>

  <p>The silken mesh fell from Lady Stanmere's hands. The agitation of those
  long, slim fingers told a tale of silent suffering. But there was a hope in
  her eyes now that made the white face beautiful.</p>

  <p>"You are certain," she asked. "But you could not make a mistake. Strange
  that Mary should have made friends with people from our own parish. Then you
  really have solved the mystery?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet. You must have patience. Your niece was no friend of these young
  people. By a judicious question or two I elicited the fact that the
  photograph in question had come quite by accident into Dick Stevenson's
  hands. The boy knows very little, but his sympathies have been enlisted on
  the side of those whose interest it is to keep the matter secret."</p>

  <p>"Then he declined to tell you?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. For the present we must leave things as they are. Your niece
  is safe and happy. Later on I may bring her back to you. But you must have
  patience. Lady Stanmere, you are attached to this place?"</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere looked across the lake to the silence of the green woods
  beyond. Her eyes filled with tears.</p>

  <p>"God knows I am," she said. "It's all that remains to me, my dear old home
  and the recollection of the early days."</p>

  <p>"And yet there is mystery here. Even you dare not inquire whence comes the
  mysterious prosperity that has built up the future of the family again. And
  in that strange hidden fortune the disappearance of your niece plays its
  part. Mind you, I don't know for certain, I can only surmise. Therefore we
  must proceed slowly. Of course, I could force the truth, but at the same time
  I might bring about an explosion that would lay Stanmere in ruins."</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere threw up her hands in a helpless gesture.</p>

  <p>"As you please," she said. "I am utterly helpless. Only bring Mary back to
  me, give me something to love and care for. This place is very dear to me,
  but there are times when I am utterly lonely."</p>

  <p>Greigstein kissed the slim fingers once more. A little while later, and he
  had forgotten everything of his mission and his own stormy past, in the
  heart-whole pursuit of a saffron-hued butterfly. It was characteristic of the
  man that he could give himself over, heart and soul, to those gentle
  pursuits.</p>

  <p>The butterfly was captured presently on the terrace before the house. A
  horrified footman demanded to know if the intruder was aware of the fact that
  he was trespassing. Greigstein meekly admitted the fact.</p>

  <p>"Then you'd better be off, my man," the footman said loftily. "And mind as
  I don't ketch you 'ere again."</p>

  <p>Greigstein went off meekly enough, and filled with a proper awe of the
  gorgeous footman. Relieved of that inspiring presence he could afford to
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"Not a bad day's work," he said. "She has forgiven me, which is much. And,
  really, that is a very fine specimen of the 'clouded yellow.'"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; "THE TIGER MOTH."</h2>

  <p>"And so I am going to be left to the beauties of Pant-street and my
  butterflies," said Greigstein, pulling meditatively at his cigarette. "Miss
  Molly, I shall be desolate. Herr Dick, do not forget your old friend when you
  are famous."</p>

  <p>Dick replied that it would be a long process. It was the last night he and
  Molly would be in Pant-street, a hot, airless night that brought the moisture
  shining on the faces of them all. To-morrow they would be in a pretty,
  sweet-smelling place of their own.</p>

  <p>"And do you give us an occasional thought from your butterflies," Molly
  laughed. "You pretend to bewail our loss, and you have been out every night
  this week after your specimens. Again this evening."</p>

  <p>"I must," Greigstein protested. "I go as I have done constantly of late,
  to Cambria Square. Positively I am on the track of a new specimen. In the
  gardens I shall capture him. An ugly, cruel, treacherous moth, but absolutely
  essential to my collection."</p>

  <p>Two little sparks gleamed in Greigstein's eyes. At the same time he leaned
  back smiling in his chair, watching the blue smoke drift upwards. A
  collecting case was on the table by his side. Molly opened it playfully.</p>

  <p>"But there is a revolver in here," she cried. "Surely you don't collect
  even the most dangerous of moths with a revolver?"</p>

  <p>Greigstein smiled. Dick regarded him fixedly.</p>

  <p>"A penny for your thoughts, Herr Dick," he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"They were professional," Dick replied. "I was wishing that I knew your
  life's history. It is a fascinating discovery for a novelist to make, that a
  harmless collector of fera-natura goes out hunting in London squares with a
  revolver."</p>

  <p>Again the steely points in Greigstein's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>"And I," he cried, "would give much to wipe out the past and stand as you
  do. Good-night, my dear young friends. I invite myself to breakfast with you
  to-morrow. Meanwhile, my moth may be waiting."</p>

  <p>He went off coolly enough, whistling an air as he went. Through the dark
  streets he took his way to Cambria Square. As he crossed over to the gardens
  a clock somewhere struck the hour of midnight. A policeman passing by touched
  his hat to the German. Evidently the two had met before. Then Greigstein sat
  down on the edge of the pavement, and proceeded to pull a pair of galoshes
  over his boots. He took a key from his pocket and proceeded to open the big
  iron gates leading into the gardens. The hinges slipped back noiselessly as
  if they had been oiled lately.</p>

  <p>Once inside, there was no occasion for further secrecy. The big trees and
  the closely planted shrubs made a perfect screen. Yet Greigstein crept along
  noiselessly, as if fearful lest the breaking of a twig should scare away his
  quarry.</p>

  <p>He crept along in the same cat-like manner until he reached the railings
  near the spot of Dick Stevenson's adventure. Then he lay at full length
  behind a laurel bush and waited patiently. He fumbled intuitively for his
  cigarette case, but abandoned the longing for tobacco with a sigh.</p>

  <p>He waited patiently for an hour or more, listening intently to any passing
  sound. Then a shadow hovered before the railings and another figure crept
  through into the gardens by means of the railing that moved.</p>

  <p>"Ah," Greigstein muttered, "so I have got my tiger moth!"</p>

  <p>The figure came along, actually stepping on the back of the German's hand
  as he passed. The latter was on his feet in a moment. His arms shot out and
  the cold blue rim of a revolver barrel was pressed against the intruder's
  neck.</p>

  <p>"Don't stir," Greigstein whispered. "As you value your precious and
  estimable existence, don't stir an inch. Oh, yes, it is a revolver you feel
  against you right enough. Go down on your knees."</p>

  <p>The stranger obeyed. He seemed absolutely overcome by fear or
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Well, now I proceed to place these spectacles over your eyes. They fit
  tight by means of extra springs. For the purpose of ocular display they are
  not a success, seeing that the lenses are of ground glass. Now permit me to
  take your arm and lead you from here. If you try to give an alarm&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The pause was ominous. The other man gave no sign, though Greigstein could
  feel his arm quivering. Presently they were walking rapidly along the
  deserted streets, stopping and turning and crossing the road as danger
  threatened. At length Greigstein dexterously piloted his capture into his own
  room, locking the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"Now, my tiger moth," he said, jubilantly, and speaking for the first time
  in his natural voice, "now my scorpion, take off those glasses."</p>

  <p>The glasses were snatched off and flung violently across the room. A tall
  man with a fine face and noble presence stood confessed. But the thin lips
  and shifty eyes detracted from the first favorable impression; there was a
  nasty red shade in the eyes, a certain restless movement of the hawk-like
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"Von Wrangel," he exclaimed, "I might have guessed it. Always florid,
  always theatrical. If you had taken the trouble to send for me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You would not have come, Stephen," Greigstein said quietly. "Besides, I
  did not know your address. By accident I heard that you were to be found some
  of these nights near Cambria Square, therefore I waited for you. Only force
  could have compelled your presence."</p>

  <p>"But no force can compel me to speak."</p>

  <p>"You will tell me everything that I desire to know," Greigstein said.
  "Bah, I have only to hold up my hand and you are no more than an empty husk
  of corn by the wayside. A word or a sign and you are a dead body floating on
  the Thames. For the sake of your good name and the noble race you belong so,
  I am here in London little better than an outcast. You betrayed us, and you
  betrayed those who were against the cause. And because of that your father
  drowned himself in the lake at Stanmere. You nearly killed your
  mother&mdash;she would be dead now if she only shared our knowledge. Bah, you
  will tell me all that I desire to learn, and you know it."</p>

  <p>The other man muttered something. He was palpably ill at ease.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said, "and get it over. I don't suppose my society is any more
  congenial to you than yours is to me. Speak out."</p>

  <p>"I am coming to it. Sit down and smoke. I shall not detain you long; I
  shall say nothing of your search, which is doomed to be unsuccessful. It is
  of the past that I desire knowledge. What have you done with the girl?"</p>

  <p>"What girl? If you are alluding to Mary&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course I am. How a pure white soul like hers ever came&mdash;But I
  need not touch that. And when your mother came to love her you took her away
  cruelly without a word. Of all the cruel, dastardly things you ever
  did&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" the other cried. His voice rang clear and loud. "With all my
  faults I loved that child. She was everything to me. In her presence I was
  another man; of my past she guessed nothing. When the time came that I could
  have her back with me, I sought her. And she had vanished."</p>

  <p>"Vanished?" Greigstein said, hoarsely. "Dog! if you dare lie to
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Before God I am telling the truth, Von Wrangel. I can look you in the
  face and say it again and again. I know not where the child has gone. I have
  laid my cherished vengeance aside to find her. Aye, I would go down on my
  knees to you if you would tell me where Mary is now."</p>

  <p>Greigstein had no reply. The cigarette fell from his fingers, and
  smouldered unheeded on the floor. The man spoke no more than the truth.</p>

  <p>"For once in my life," Greigstein said, slowly, "I am utterly and
  hopelessly beaten."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; POLICY OF SILENCE.</h2>

  <p>Dick Stephenson, face to face with Mr. Spencer in the 'Record' office,
  could say nothing for a time. Surely his new-found friend must recognise him
  for the man who had done him a single service so short a time ago. But there
  was absolutely no sign of recognition in Spencer's eyes.</p>

  <p>Well, it did not much matter. Dick's plain policy was to be discreet. He
  would hold the secret of the adventure close, and some day it could be turned
  to account. He waited now for Spencer to speak.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about yourself," the latter said, presently. "Do not be afraid.
  I, too, have known what it is to be poor."</p>

  <p>Dick spoke freely enough. Spencer might have been a mystery, there might
  be something terribly wrong about his past, but his was a face that most men
  would trust. And as Dick told his history he felt that his companion was
  following him with the deepest interest and attention.</p>

  <p>"The old story," he said, kindly. "All you want is a start. It is good
  work that you have done for us, but, unfortunately, there are so many
  journalists nowadays who can do good general work. I am going to send you
  into the assistant editor's office, there to make yourself useful. I can give
  you £300 a year, and as to the rest, why, that is in your hands."</p>

  <p>Dick tried to say something and failed. He had not expected anything like
  this. The realisation of a score of fond dreams was possible now. He could
  get Molly away from Pant-street without delay. For the present they would
  rent a furnished cottage. They might even get back to Stanmere again. Manby
  Junction was only a mile from the village, and there were plenty of
  trains.</p>

  <p>Dick came out of his reveries to the knowledge that his benefactor was
  speaking. As he looked about the room his eyes caught sight of a large
  photograph of Stanmere House. Spencer followed the glance.</p>

  <p>"Do you know that place?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I was born there," Dick said, with a shaky voice. "My father was rector
  of the parish for twenty years. Ah, if I could only get back there!"</p>

  <p>"Bless my soul," Spencer cried. "You are the son of my old&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then you, too, know Stanmere!" Dick interrupted eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I never said so," Spencer responded coldly. There was something furtive
  in his eyes now, a suggestion of fear, of having said too much. "I&mdash;I
  was nearly buying the place once. You must excuse me, but I am on the verge
  of one of my forgetful fits again."</p>

  <p>He passed his hand across his eyes wearily. The next moment he seemed to
  be trying to look into Dick's very soul.</p>

  <p>"I was trying to recall what I know of Stanmere," he said. "I knew the
  district well as a boy; in fact, I used to go there in my schooldays and look
  for white heather on the uplands behind the Warren. An old friend of mine had
  a cottage there, called 'Shepherd's Spring.'"</p>

  <p>Dick gave an exclamation of delight. Just for the moment he had forgotten
  that he was talking business in a great newspaper office. The beauties of the
  rolling landscape were before his eyes now, he could see the fertile valley
  and the great sheets of purple heather with the sombre pines and the
  no-man's-land beyond.</p>

  <p>"I know the country blindfold," Dick said. "I could take you right through
  those bogs and soft spots at midnight. I could hide there and baffle my
  pursuers for a month. I could&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dick paused, for Spencer's eyes were blazing. His face was working with an
  excitement that was almost painful.</p>

  <p>"Ah, to be sure," he said hoarsely. He was pacing up and down the office
  now. "One would like to be there, of course. One could double and twist and
  turn and none be any the wiser. Boy, can I really honestly trust you?"</p>

  <p>"I try to be like my father," Dick said, simply.</p>

  <p>"And he was a good man. Mind you, I didn't say that I knew him. I dare say
  that you could manage it. There are plenty of trains and a good road from the
  junction. I could get Fisher to see that you were not kept late."</p>

  <p>All this with more or less incoherent words and excited gestures. Heaven
  alone knew what strong emotions were passing through the man's mind.
  Presently he grew more calm and dropped into his seat with the air of one
  physically exhausted.</p>

  <p>"I see what you are longing for," he said. "You want to get away from the
  miserable street where you are and into the country. I will arrange with Mr.
  Fisher that you can leave the office pretty early. You shall take your sister
  away for the summer at any rate, and I will place Shepherd's Spring at your
  disposal. As a matter of fact, it belongs to me. I bought it for the sake of
  quietness after a long illness."</p>

  <p>Dick said something, he hardly knew what. He seemed suddenly to have
  blundered into a country of fairy surprises. And yet at the same time he
  could not rid himself of the feeling that he was playing a part in a drama,
  he was a subordinate piece on a chessboard where a tremendous game was going
  on.</p>

  <p>"The place is small, but well furnished," Spencer said. He was quite cool
  and matter-of-fact now. "You will find everything you want there, and should
  easily manage with one servant. No, you must not thank me, because some day
  you may be able to repay me."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch, an indication that the interview was finished and
  that the man of money had greater interests in hand.</p>

  <p>"I will," Dick said, passionately. "Anything I can do for you, sir, I
  will. You have taken a great weight from my heart, and I will serve you as
  man was never served before. I can be discreet and silent, I can&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused, a little ashamed of himself. Spencer smiled.</p>

  <p>"You can't buy friends," he said. "Yes, I think I can trust you. I will
  arrange for your duties with my editor, Mr. Fisher. If you go around to Mr.
  Marlett's, 66 Lincoln's Inn, to-morrow, and say you came from me, he will
  give you the key of Shepherd's Spring. And now I must ask you to say
  good-night."</p>

  <p>Spencer touched the bell, his face grew keen and alert; he was the
  rigorous man of business once more before Dick had time to leave the
  office.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; WHITE HEATHER.</h2>

  <p>"I shall wake up presently and find it is all a dream," Molly said, with
  her face turned to the blue sky. "Dick, to think that a week should make all
  the difference to our fortunes! Already Pant-street has become a vague
  memory."</p>

  <p>Dick was lying on his back on a patch of purple heather and listening to
  the hum of the bees. The air was crisp and pure. Down below lay the valley
  with its golden patches of cornland. In a belt or trees Stanmere nestled.
  High up were the great woods and the stretches of heather, and behind again a
  desolate land of ravine and rock and bog and larch, where no man ventured
  after dark unless he was born to the soil. But Dick had had the benefit of
  twenty years' personal acquaintance with the place, and it was no idle boast
  of his that he could find his way over the moor blindfold.</p>

  <p>Down in a little hollow in the centre of a shady garden lay Shepherd's
  Spring. Dick had the key in his pocket, but they had not entered yet. But all
  their belongings lay outside the gate, and a freshly engaged maidservant
  mounted guard over it. It was quite impossible to think about the house yet,
  for Dick and Molly had a thousand sweet old associations to renew.</p>

  <p>They stayed there on the heath pointing this and that spot out to one
  another till Molly's eyes grew dim, and she had to use her handkerchief. When
  Dick produced a lunch basket, a hearty meal was partaken of in spite of the
  wasps. There was zeal about that luncheon that neither of them ever
  forgot.</p>

  <p>"I want to dance and shout and sing," Molly cried. "And I shall have you
  here from now till Monday morning. And there is a sprig of white
  heather!"</p>

  <p>She darted on it, and placed it in her hat. The cream white coralled bloom
  was all that was needed to make her happiness complete. Dick was more sober.
  Perhaps he was a little frightened at his sudden good fortune.</p>

  <p>"Let us go into the house," he said. "I'm just a trifle fay, as the Scotch
  say. I don't know, Molly, but we are on the verge of tremendous events, and I
  am chosen for one of the puppets in the drama. Let us see the cottage."</p>

  <p>The garden was trim and tidy, for it had been seen to regularly. Inside
  the rooms were small, and Spencer's estimate that they were well furnished
  was a modest statement, for the place was luxuriously appointed. There were
  fine carpets and pictures and statues, old china and Empire furniture, oak
  and Chippendale, and Adam and the like. Dick gasped as he looked at the
  drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen a ghost?" Molly asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, something like it," Dick admitted. "This room has given me quite a
  turn. It is smaller, but it is furnished exactly like the drawing-room in
  Cambria Square where I first met my dear little blind girl."</p>

  <p>"Something resembling, you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely the same. The same small tables and the vases and glasses for
  flowers. When you have filled them all with blossoms the likeness will be
  marvellous. Molly, what does all this mean?"</p>

  <p>No lucid explanation came to the bewildered Molly. The two seemed to have
  blundered into the heart of a mystery like a dark, unfamiliar landscape that
  from time to time was illuminated by a flash of lightning. Every day seemed
  to bring some fresh surprise.</p>

  <p>"It maddens me," Dick cried. "Just think of the extraordinary patchwork of
  adventures that I have had lately, and how inexplicable they are, and how
  they fit together. If that man has deliberately led us into
  trouble&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But it does not seem possible," Molly urged. "Mr. Spencer has a great
  reputation. He has been very kind to you, and you say he has a noble
  face."</p>

  <p>"So he has," Dick admitted, "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But me no buts, sir. It was by the purest accident that you became of
  service to Mr. Spencer. And see how kind he has been to you."</p>

  <p>"And yet I am certain he had some deep design when he offered me this
  place. If you had only seen how his eyes lighted up and how he talked to
  himself! I tell you, it was a sudden inspiration."</p>

  <p>"And a very good one for us," Molly laughed. "Oh, I admit the mystery,
  which, my dear boy, is no business of ours. Mr. Spencer chooses to keep his
  daughter to himself, and you are warned to keep clear and think no more about
  the matter."</p>

  <p>"I shall never forget that pathetic, beautiful face and those blue eyes,"
  Dick said. "And I am glad to think she has been here."</p>

  <p>"My dear Dick, what do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Sherlock Holmes," Dick smiled. "She has told me that she needed no eyes
  so far as her own room was concerned. This room would not be a replica of the
  one in Cambria Square unless blind Mary had been here. Here is the foundation
  of a novel, if I could only get to the bottom of it."</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile I have something more practical to do," said Molly. "Give a
  hand, Dick, so that we can have a walk after tea with a clear
  conscience."</p>

  <p>It was a glorious ramble after tea through that lovely familiar country,
  down through the leafy silence of the warren, where every step held some
  precious association, and back again by way of the Stanmere woods and through
  the breast-high bracken home. Then they rested for a moment, silent for the
  time being.</p>

  <p>The silence was broken presently by a sharp voice, followed by one pitched
  in a rusty key like the creaking of a door. Down the drive under the beeches
  towards Stanmere two men were walking, apparently discussing some point of
  the deepest interest. They passed Dick and his sister quite unconscious of
  their presence.</p>

  <p>"Herr Greigstein," Molly exclaimed. "Greigstein in Harris tweeds, looking
  like a large landed proprietor. It is quite apparent that he is not down here
  for the pleasure of our society. Who is the little man with the face of dried
  parchment. He looks like Mr. Tulkinghorn&mdash;the traditional receptacle for
  family secrets."</p>

  <p>Dick nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>"You have got it," he said. "That is Mr. Martlett, of Lincoln's Inn, the
  old lawyer from whom I got the keys of our cottage. The drama progresses,
  Molly. I wonder what part I am cut for&mdash;the fool or the hero?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; MR. MARTLETT.</h2>

  <p>A little way down the road Greigstein stopped and said something to his
  rusty-looking companion, then he turned aside from the main road and
  disappeared into the woods. The small man with the parchment face and the
  inscrutable expression sauntered on thoughtfully till he reached the lodge
  gates of Stanmere. With his hands behind him he strolled along very much with
  the air of one who possesses the place. The butler who answered the ring fell
  into an attitude of deference before the little man in the rusty black, for
  this was Mr. James Martlett, the family lawyer, and a power in the land.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew anything about Mr. Martlett, who he was or whence he came, but
  most people knew that he was an exceedingly rich lawyer, who for the last
  thirty years had lived dingily in Lincoln's Inn.</p>

  <p>A close, secretive, furtive man, who said very little, but that little to
  the point. Many a family secret reposed in that unemotional breast, many a
  great house on the verge of ruin had found safety in Martlett's capable
  hands. But he would always have his own way, and nothing would deviate him
  from his course. His clear grey eyes seemed to read everything. There was a
  sense of power about the man. The Stanmere butler was a great personage, but
  even he deemed it best to be deferential to Mr. James Martlett.</p>

  <p>"I've come down to dine and sleep, Goss," he said, calmly. "See that my
  things are put out in my bedroom, and let her ladyship know that I have
  arrived. I don't suppose that I shall be in to tea."</p>

  <p>Goss intimated that all these things should be done. He hoped that Mr.
  Martlett had had a pleasant journey from town. Dinner was at eight as usual.
  Her ladyship was at present in her room. Martlett strolled away with his
  hands still behind him. He inspected the lawns and the gravelled walks
  carefully, even the Scotch head gardener was polite to him. Then he went on,
  as if aimlessly, across the park and up the slopes of purple heather until he
  came at length to Shepherd's Spring. With the same air of possession upon him
  he walked into the house. In the hall Molly was arranging some flowers, and
  Dick was watching her approvingly.</p>

  <p>"So you young people have found your way here," Martlett said in a voice
  that sounded like the creaking of a rusty hinge. "How are you both? Dick
  Stevenson, I am very much displeased with you. When your father died I wound
  up his affairs for him. Contrary to my usual custom, I made no charge for so
  doing. Why didn't you come and see me in London?"</p>

  <p>"Because he is too proud," Molly laughed. "Like most people, Dick is a
  little afraid of you. On the contrary, I am not in the least afraid, though
  it happens I have never seen you before. There! What do you think of that,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>She stooped and laid her fresh cool lips to the lawyer's crackled face.
  Martlett came as near to a smile as he permitted himself.</p>

  <p>"Dick called for the keys," he said, "actually called for the keys of this
  house, and never asked to see me. He never told my friend Spencer that we
  were old acquaintances. Now, there's pride for you! And yet you would never
  have had the offer of Shepherd's Spring if it had not been for me."</p>

  <p>"That's very kind of you," Dick said, gratefully. "But we didn't want
  anybody to know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That you were not the great genius that you took yourself to be,
  therefore you preferred to starve in London. I had my eye on you. And if
  there is one thing I admire more than another it is grit and determination.
  But you are all right; you should get on now."</p>

  <p>Dick had not the slightest doubt about it. The little man with his hands
  behind his back eyed him critically. He was pulling the strings of all the
  puppets in the drama. He chose his figures deliberately, and the specimen
  before him pleased the old lawyer exceedingly.</p>

  <p>"It is a charming little house, and I trust you will be happy here," he
  said. "Only you must be careful not to lose yourself in those bogs over
  yonder. They tell me there are some horrible places in the woods beyond the
  Warren."</p>

  <p>"And I know every inch of it," Dick cried. "Give me a supply of provisions
  and I could defy a regiment of detectives for a month there. I don't suppose
  anybody knows the lower moorland paths besides myself, now."</p>

  <p>Mr. Martlett was deeply interested. There was something subtle about
  Dick's suggestion. He insisted upon having it all explained to him
  outside.</p>

  <p>"It appeals to me," he cried. His eyes gleamed with an unusual fire. "Now,
  suppose you had to hide somebody here, somebody in peril of the law. The
  police are hot on his track. You mean to say you could baffle them?"</p>

  <p>Dick responded eagerly. He proceeded to draw a map like the web of a
  spider on the garden path. He knew a hut at a certain part where nobody had
  been for years, a hut low down in a ferny hollow. There was no known pathway
  to it, its existence was forgotten.</p>

  <p>"I know every blade of grass by the way," Dick said. "I learnt the
  moorland by heart from the last of the old shepherds. Sheep are not kept here
  now, because people are afraid of losing them. When I was young and longed to
  be a pirate the old hut beyond the moss bog used to be my ship, you see."</p>

  <p>But Martlett was no longer listening. The fire had died out of his eyes,
  his mind seemed to be fixed on other problems. He came to himself with an
  uneasy kind of laugh as he met Dick's injured gaze.</p>

  <p>"I am more interested than you imagine," he said. "My dear boy, you fancy
  that you are here by the accident, of a happy circumstance. Nothing of the
  kind. There are great interests at stake, and I am the general directing
  them. But I am old, and my nerves are not what they were, and I may want
  strength and courage and audacity to rely upon. Our conversation may seem
  trivial to you now, but the time may come when you will recall it vividly.
  Are you sure you can do what you say?"</p>

  <p>Martlett's voice sank to a hoarse whisper. His hand had fallen on Dick's
  arm and crooked upon it with a nervous grip.</p>

  <p>"I spoke no more than the truth, sir," Dick said, quietly.</p>

  <p>"Good boy, good boy! Permit me to take a pinch of snuff. Nothing is so
  soothing to the nerves. If you serve those who would be your friends, there
  is a fine fortune before you. And don't be too curious as to our friend
  Greigstein."</p>

  <p>Martlett passed down the garden path, leaving Dick to his own bewildered
  thoughts. The little shuffling man in the rusty black seemed to know
  everything. Certainly he was on the best terms with himself as he tied his
  old fashioned cravat and donned his quaint dress clothes an hour or so
  later.</p>

  <p>He passed down the wide old staircase into the drawing-room in time to
  open the door for Lady Stanmere. There was quite a bouquet in the flavor of
  his manners&mdash;courtly, chivalrous, but ever with the suggestion of power.
  He had it now as he bent over Lady Stanmere's hand. He never lost it as he
  stood there chatting over a variety of general topics. The place was looking
  charming; Goss had informed him that the trout fishing had been good&mdash;to
  all of which Lady Stanmere replied timidly with her eyes on the clock.</p>

  <p>Dinner was served at length&mdash;a long, elaborate meal, with a fine show
  of old silver and Venetian glass, the artistic beauty of which appealed to
  Martlett much, as if it had been Dutch delf. A simple chop and a glass of
  port would have sufficed him. The oaken wall, with their pictures and armor,
  the pools of light from shaded lamps, and the banks of flowers, passed
  unheeded. Dessert was over at length, and then Goss handed the lawyer a box
  of cigars and a cedar-spill.</p>

  <p>"Have I your permission, my lady?" Martlett asked.</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere bowed. The little ceremony lost none of its flavour by lapse
  of years. A faint blue cloud drifted across the banks of flowers. Lady
  Stanmere played nervously with her wineglass, empty as it was.</p>

  <p>"I received your most amazing letter," she said. "We are under a great
  debt to you, a very great debt indeed, sir, that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But your ladyship imagines that I am going too far. That is a perfectly
  natural idea. When I made the suggestion that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Suggestion! It was a positive command."</p>

  <p>Martlett bowed. Nothing seemed to disturb his equanimity.</p>

  <p>"Hardly that," he said. "You wrote to me that you had made a discovery.
  You were aware to a certain extent what had become of a certain young lady.
  Von Wrangel, otherwise Greigstein, had seen her photograph in the hands of a
  young man who had lodged under the same roof as our valuable German friend. I
  am sorry that you received Von Wrangel at all. Surely your family has
  suffered enough at his hands. Not that I doubt his good intentions. There was
  your son Stephen, for instance. I have my own suspicions as to Stephen's
  character."</p>

  <p>"Which are not very favorable," Lady Stanmere said, bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Well, madam, they are not. Truth compels me to state that I know no more
  unmitigated scoundrel than Stephen. But all this is beside the point. If I
  had seen Von Wrangel a day or two sooner you would never have heard about
  that photograph. I wish I could tell you everything, but the secret is not
  entirely mine. It may seem strange, perhaps dramatic, but the greatest
  misfortune that could overtake your house now would be to have your niece
  back under your roof again."</p>

  <p>The words fell with cold and clear distinctness from Martlett's lips. Lady
  Stanmere regarded him with astonished eyes. Above all things Martlett was
  practical. He spoke now like the stage lawyer of melodrama.</p>

  <p>"You are playing with me," Lady Stanmere cried. The long slim hands were
  trembling, her rings streamed like unsteady fire. "What harm could it
  do?"</p>

  <p>"I repeat, I cannot tell you," Martlett replied. "Be advised by me, think
  what I have done for you. Only a few years since and the house was on the
  verge of ruin. And look at it now. I pledge you my word that the child shall
  come back some day. If you defy me in the matter you will never cease to
  regret it. If you elect to do so the work of years will be lost."</p>

  <p>Martlett's voice sank to a hoarse, whisper. The stem of a wineglass
  snapped in his fingers, but he did not heed. Evidently the man was terribly
  in earnest. It seemed strange, almost incredible, that the presence or
  absence of a blind girl should make all this terrible difference to the
  family fortunes.</p>

  <p>"The girl is the heart of the mystery," Martlett went on. "She came to you
  mysteriously, she vanished in the same way. The girl is pure and good and an
  angel, and she knows as little of the intrigues about her. And now your
  ladyship will be good enough to promise me that you will take no further
  steps in the matter."</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere bowed. She did not care to trust herself to words. Martlett
  rose and offered his arm with old-fashioned courtesy. His manner was
  deferential, he might have been overcome with a sense of the honour conferred
  upon him. There was a queer, dry smile on his lips as he returned to the
  dining-room. He drew up an easy chair by the fireplace and rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"You were pleased to want something, sir," Goss asked.</p>

  <p>"I was," Martlett said. "Within a few minutes there will be a man here
  asking to see Lady Stanmere. He looks like a gentleman, Goss, but in these
  matters appearances are apt to be terribly deceptive. When this man comes
  show him in here without a word of explanation. And then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," Goss murmured, as Martlett paused. "And then, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Well, then you can close the door carefully behind you and keep an eye on
  the place."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; BLACKMAIL.</h2>

  <p>Martlett lay back dreamily contemplating the loves of the angels as
  depicted on the ceiling of the dining room, as if that fine artistic effort
  had been the crowning work of his career. In a way he had built up the
  fortunes of Stanmere, and yet this dry practical lawyer was one of the
  central figures in one of the strangest romances ever known.</p>

  <p>And the work was not finished yet, though Stanmere was once more a fine,
  almost free property. Martlett and another had built it up step by step, and
  the fascinating process was no less fragrant because the house of cards might
  be knocked down at any moment. Resolution and tact were required, and the
  exercise of that delicate finesse which the soul of the lawyer loved.</p>

  <p>He did not look very much as if he were waiting for an antagonist who
  might at moment ruin the whole beautiful scheme. It was a dangerous
  antagonist, but that did not prevent Martlett from getting the full flavour
  of his tobacco. He smiled grimly as he heard the clang of the door bell.
  Almost immediately Goss entered the dining room stiff and dignified, with his
  nose in the air, as if he smelt something unpleasant.</p>

  <p>"The person you spoke of, sir," he said. "Party of the name of
  Venner."</p>

  <p>"A gentleman named Venner, confound you," a swaggering voice said. "But
  when your ladyship has had as much to do with&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door closed with more force than the immaculate Goss generally
  employed, and the new-comer came to an abrupt pause. His easy swagger
  vanished, he stood with an uneasy grin on his face.</p>

  <p>A handsome, cunning brutal face; a face lighted by shifty grey eyes, a
  face coarsened and hardened by dissipation. The man was tall and well set up,
  but his swaggering air was a veneer: he had bully written all over him. His
  dress, too, was fashionable, with a touch of caricature in it. A certain
  staginess clung like scent to the man.</p>

  <p>"Well, Venner," Martlett said, in his dry way. He looked up with the end
  of his cigar between his fingers. "So you came to see Lady Stanmere? As
  matter of fact you are not going to see Lady Stanmere."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed," Vernier sneered. "We shall see about that."</p>

  <p>"We shall indeed. What are you going to do with that chair?"</p>

  <p>"What does a man generally do with a chair? Sit on it, of course."</p>

  <p>"You are not going to sit down. I do not choose to be a vis-a-vis with a
  scoundrel of a valet who has just served a term of imprisonment. If you try
  that on again I'll have you flung from the house by a footman."</p>

  <p>All very quietly spoken and in a low voice. But the lawyer's face was hard
  and his eyes steely. The other man laughed uneasily. But during the rest of
  the interview he stood, moving restlessly from one foot to the other.</p>

  <p>"My wife put you up to this," he growled. "My angel wife, my dove-eyed
  partner who calls herself Nurse Cecilia. When I&mdash;I came back to
  London&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By the way of Portland and Wormwood Scrubbs?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind that. I hastened back to the partner of my joys and sorrows.
  You can imagine my anxiety to see her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With a view to something&mdash;strictly temporary&mdash;in the way of a
  loan."</p>

  <p>Venner stepped from one leg to the other again.</p>

  <p>"I didn't got it," he muttered, "not a penny. She said that I was the
  cross she had to bear. She offered me food and shelter till I could find some
  honest living, but on the currency question she was firm. Then I lost my
  temper and was fool enough to tell Cecily that down here there were chances.
  You couldn't have got to know my game in any other way."</p>

  <p>"All the same I did," Martlett replied. "Now listen to me. For over five
  years we have been free of you. In five years many things have happened."</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay. The house of Stanmere has got prosperous for one thing."</p>

  <p>"It has. Exceedingly prosperous. We have money to spare now, money to go
  into your pocket if necessary. You smile. Oh, I know your power. It is
  possible for a dirty, cowardly scoundrel like you to bring disgrace upon this
  house. If our penal laws were not so unhappily strict I should know how to
  act. In Corsica, for instance, I should give some bravo twenty pounds to put
  a knife between your ribs. In so doing I should look confidently for the
  applause of society. In this effete country one has to buy off men like
  you."</p>

  <p>Venner's grey eyes gleamed. Martlett was coming to business at last.</p>

  <p>"The question is," the lawyer went on, "what do you know?"</p>

  <p>"And a fair question too. I know that my master, Mr. Paul, is hiding away
  somewhere in London."</p>

  <p>Martlett nodded and glanced critically at his cigar. The fencing was
  beginning in earnest now. The keen intellect was aroused.</p>

  <p>"I hate Mr. Paul," Venner went on. "I should never have known the inside
  of a gaol but for him. He put me aside when he could have told a lie or two
  to save me, and he started on what he called a new life. And when I came out
  of an American prison I started to hunt for him. There is still that warrant
  out for him across the water for murder. It would be a nice thing to see a
  Stanmere hanged for a crime like that. Revenge I wanted, revenge I craved
  for. But what is revenge compared with money!"</p>

  <p>"What, indeed?" Martlett asked, sententiously. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"Well, I got into trouble again, and my wife put me off the scent once.
  She can never forget that her father had a small farm on this Stanmere
  Estate."</p>

  <p>"Your wife is a good and true woman, Venner."</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course," Vernier sneered. "But I am on the track of my man now,
  and when I have hunted him down I shall state my terms. If I asked you, I
  should be told that Mr. Paul in dead, which would be a lie, my old fox. When
  I am sure of my game I shall want ten thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"You will never have so many pence, Venner."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes I shall. Mr. Stephen will be good for something for the credit of
  my family. Mr. Stephen has turned respectable. Mr. Stephen lives in Cambria
  Square with his daughter in a style that isn't done for nothing; Mr. Stephen
  lies low and takes his walks abroad at night, as gentlemen frequently have to
  do who dabble too much in shady European politics."</p>

  <p>Mr. Martlett smiled approvingly at the end of his cigar. He had every
  scrap of information that the bully had to offer him. Like most of his class,
  the man talked too fast. He had said more in the last few minutes than
  Martlett could have hoped to pump out of him in an hour. His face
  hardened.</p>

  <p>"Now listen to me," he said. "For the present you can do nothing; for the
  present you are perfectly harmless. When you find your man it will be time
  enough to come here with your threats. But I warn you that you stand on
  dangerous ground. There are tremendous interests at stake here with which you
  cannot be allowed to interfere. Perhaps you may compel me to purchase your
  silence later on, ay, but the proof must be clear. I know your past life like
  an open book. There are three charges upon which I could have you arrested at
  any moment. And if you dare to write one line or one word to Lady Stanmere
  I'll lay you by the heels before a day is over your head."</p>

  <p>Venner would have threatened, only his courage failed. For the present, at
  any rate, he was going to get nothing here. And, quite imprudently, he had
  laid out his last five shillings in his return journey to Stanmere. It was
  very hard, so hard that the tears of self-pity were very near the
  surface.</p>

  <p>"If you would not mind advancing me a few pounds," he said, with a servile
  manner that caused Martlett to smile. "Say five pounds, sir. I've got a
  little scheme on hand that in the course of a few days&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not a farthing," said Martlett. "If you are penniless, so much the
  better." He had his hand on the bell, and Goss, with his nose still
  suspicious of unsavoury odours, appeared. "Goss, show this fellow out. And if
  he comes again bang the door in his face. If that does not suffice, duck him
  in the lake. You need not be in the least afraid of the consequences."</p>

  <p>The door closed again, and Martlett carefully selected another cigar. It
  was a piece of reckless dissipation on his part.</p>

  <p>"So the deception works," he said to himself. "It was the only way of
  keeping that fellow in the dark. Did ever such tremendous interests before
  rest on the shoulders of a poor blind girl!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; A DISCOVERY.</h2>

  <p>Turned out into a cold and heartless world, Venner made his way from
  Victoria Station in an easterly direction. He had nothing in his pockets, the
  accommodating establishments under the three golden balls were all closed for
  the night, and his land lady was of a harsh and suspicious nature. Even the
  bright genius of Horace Venner could see no way out of the
  difficulty&mdash;-but one.</p>

  <p>He would go and see his wife. Hunger and thirst&mdash;especially the
  latter&mdash;had sharpened his wits, and before he had come to the end of his
  journey a dozen brilliant lies and plausible excuses for the loan of a
  sovereign occurred to him. It was cruelly hard work, for he had counted upon
  seeing Lady Stanmere, who might have been 'good for anything' up to three
  figures. And now that was entirely a thing of the past. He knew and feared
  Mr. Martlett too well to disregard his instructions.</p>

  <p>He reached his destination at length, a fairly large house at the back of
  Southampton square, let out into rooms and suites of rooms. On the second
  floor he paused, and then passed into a pleasantly furnished little sitting
  room, which was empty. There was a bedroom beyond, and into this Venner
  peeped. It was empty, but the gas was not turned down, so the occupant of the
  rooms could not be far off. Venner knew his wife's careful, thrifty ways.</p>

  <p>He could afford to wait patiently, for the simple reason that he had
  nowhere else to go, unless good luck were on his side. His predatory eye
  glanced round the room disapprovingly. There was none of that class of
  portable property here such as the soul of Mr. Wemmick loved&mdash;no watch,
  no spoons or rings or anything of that kind. A gold watch, now, might have
  saved a useless discussion.</p>

  <p>Perhaps they were in the bedroom. Women often keep trifles of that kind on
  their dressing-tables. Venner strolled casually into the bedroom, whistling
  an air. His heart glowed within him. There was a gold watch there with an
  inscription upon it, a present from a grateful patient.</p>

  <p>Venner conveyed it to his pocket. The air on his lips grew more gay, and
  then suddenly stopped altogether. For there were voices in the sitting room,
  low and hurried voices; a man's, hard and defiant; a woman's, urging and
  persuading. There was some familiar suggestion about the man, as to the
  woman, there was no mistake whatever. It was Venner's wife.</p>

  <p>Well, he would wait for developments. If he was caught he would slip the
  watch back again, and make some excuse for his appearance there. He was
  listening intently now, for experience told him that though listeners seldom
  heard any good of themselves they frequently heard ill of other people, and
  knowledge of human weaknesses is something remunerative.</p>

  <p>"I fancy I managed it all right," the man said. "It was a stroke of genius
  using your cloak and bonnet in the dark. And of course you passed unmolested.
  I fancy it quite safe to go now."</p>

  <p>"Not just yet," the woman's voice urged. "Stay a little longer, sir. For
  the sake of the old days, and Stanmere, don't run into needless danger."</p>

  <p>The listener started joyfully. Here was a piece of amazing luck, luck so
  stupendous that he could hardly contain himself. He stumbled quite by
  accident upon the very man out of all the world that he most desired to see.
  In his own wife's lodgings he had found him.</p>

  <p>Yet there was nothing so wonderful about it, seeing that Cecilia Venner
  had ever been devoted to the family of Stanmere.</p>

  <p>"But I can't stay," the man said. "I am pretty sure that we baffled them
  and that the coast is clear. My dear soul, you need not be alarmed."</p>

  <p>"All the same, I am going down into the roadway to see, sir," Nurse
  Cecilia said. "You can wait at the top of the stairs. It is quite dark there.
  But, whatever you do, don't go downstairs till I come back."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, I won't. What a loyal little thing you are, to be sure. If
  all the people about Stanmere had been like you, I might have turned out
  differently."</p>

  <p>The listener peeped through the crack of the door. He saw his wife creep
  out, he could make out the outline of the man's figure. There was no mistake
  about it, the passing years had made changes on hair and features and
  carriage, but there was the man that Venner longed to see. As the man
  followed impatiently into the darkness of the landing Venner crept after him.
  On second thoughts he decided to retain possession of the watch for the
  present.</p>

  <p>He was safe now, he was quite sure that his quarry had not seen him emerge
  on the landing. He had only to wait now and to follow, and the £10,000 would
  be in his grip. The mere thought of it turned him dizzy. There was a footstep
  on the stairs and a few whispered words. It was all safe evidently. The
  stranger was in the street at length and Venner close behind him. He could
  swear to that walk and the swing of those shoulders anywhere. The man in
  front came presently into Gordon square, silent and deserted now, and then
  Venner ranged up alongside the figure in front.</p>

  <p>His discoloured teeth showed in a broad grin, he reached out his hand
  playfully and smote the other on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"So I've got you at last," he said. "I've had some bits of good luck in my
  time, but never anything quite so fine as this. Say that you are glad to see
  me, say that the sight of my rugged, honest face&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Venner paused. The man turned and faced him with a cool smile and a face
  as unbroken as that of an amused child. Venner had expected him to stagger
  back and cry out, to turn white and stammer for mercy.</p>

  <p>There was nothing of this in the programme. The man with the cool smile
  flashed out an arm with the suddenness of lightning; there was a sickening
  sound, and Venner went down headlong to the ground with blood trickling from
  a cut lip. Only the instinct that it might spoil the game kept him from
  howling for mercy.</p>

  <p>"Now, don't you try that on with me again," the stranger said with perfect
  equanimity. "Get up, you rascal. If this had happened in San
  Francisco&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are a bold hand, Mr. Paul," Venner said, as he struggled to his feet.
  "But you shall pay for this a hundred-fold."</p>

  <p>The cool smile faded from the other man's face.</p>

  <p>"Well, I almost fancied that I recognised you," he said. "But my good man,
  you have made a great mistake. I am not Paul, but the other man. And you are
  Paul's valet, Horace Venner. There is no mistaking that half-cringing,
  half-bullying manner of yours. I have known a good many scoundrels in my
  time, but never a worse than you. And your father was an honest man."</p>

  <p>"So was your father for that matter," Venner said, sullenly.</p>

  <p>The other man laughed silently, as if the joke amused him.</p>

  <p>"You are looking for your master," he said. "Strange to say, I am also
  looking for your late master. I have been looking for him for years. And when
  I do meet him there will be an account that will take some wiping out. Where
  is he?"</p>

  <p>Venner gave a gesture of despair.</p>

  <p>"Goodness knows," he muttered. "I thought I had him here to-night. When I
  was in&mdash;but never mind that. I followed the wrong man. Trust a Stanmere
  to do queer things. I should prefer Cambria Square; but there is no
  accounting for tastes."</p>

  <p>"What has Cambria Square got to do with it?"</p>

  <p>Venner executed an ingenious wink expressive of deep cunning.</p>

  <p>"Knowledge is power," he said. "I've seen you coming out of that handsome
  flat in Cambria Square more than once. You must have had a good stroke of
  luck lately to be able to afford a place like that. Only it can't be pleasant
  to have to creep out after dark, like the bats and the cats&mdash;what's
  up?"</p>

  <p>The other man gave a cry, a cry of pain. He staggered back with his hand
  to his side, his face was ghastly white.</p>

  <p>"An old wound," he said, "I got in New Orleans. The pain is dreadful. You
  are an excellent scout, Venner, and have a way of nosing out secrets that is
  marvelous. But I wouldn't say too much about Cambria Square if I were you.
  Sometimes I am there and sometimes I have missions that take me elsewhere.
  Good-night."</p>

  <p>"Half a minute sir," Venner said, eagerly. "If you've got a sovereign or
  two about you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I haven't got five shillings; I am as poor as you are. And even if
  circumstances were otherwise I shouldn't help you. You are a pestilential
  scoundrel, Venner, and I would gladly come to your execution to-morrow.
  Good-night Venner, I am going back to Cambria Square."</p>

  <p>The speaker turned on his heel and strode rapidly into the darkness. His
  face was white and set, his eyes gleamed like sullen fire.</p>

  <p>"So I have got it at last," he muttered. "Almost! Confound my impetuosity!
  I might have got Venner to tell me the number of my flat in Cambria
  Square."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; A LIGHTED MATCH.</h2>

  <p>Dick was disposed to make fun of the mystery as he and Molly walked back
  to Shepherd's Spring, after seeing Mr. Martlett and Greigstein together. The
  strong, clear air had got into his veins; the knowledge that all this wide,
  silent beauty was his to share thrilled him. After the weary struggle and the
  sordid horror of Pant-street, Stanmere was delicious.</p>

  <p>Molly and Dick loitered along till the grey shadows began to creep over
  the moor, and and the tangled woods faded to a dark mass. The cottage door
  was open, and the lamplight streamed hospitably out.</p>

  <p>"I am really hungry," Dick cried; "a real healthy hunger; not the dreadful
  feeling we had in Pant-street. New bread and butter and fresh eggs and tea.
  Nothing like Arcadia! But that tobacco does not smell Arcadia at all."</p>

  <p>The air of the house was heavy with cigarette smoke. Greigstein was seated
  in the in the dining room. He was looking wistfully at the table.</p>

  <p>"My young friends, I am delighted," he he cried. "Positively it is useless
  for you to try and get rid of me. The loneliness of Pant-street is appalling.
  I could not resist the temptation to run down here."</p>

  <p>Dick looked at Molly and smiled. In the light of recent discoveries they
  could not take much of a compliment to themselves. And Greigstein looked
  different&mdash;more spruce and far better groomed than usual. Nobody but a
  West-End tailor could have made the clothes that he was wearing. He did not
  look in the least like the little German schoolmaster with the taste for
  butterflies.</p>

  <p>"I have been been on the hunt, of course," he said, "but with poor
  results. An intelligent labourer tells me there are wondrous winged things of
  amazing beauty in the bogs over behind the Warren. But as nobody dare venture
  there, the information is all the more disappointing. I ask for a guide, and
  and behold! there is none. The last was a boy who used to live here. I demand
  his name; and do you suppose they told me his name was? Why, Master Dick
  Stevenson."</p>

  <p>"Behold the man!" Dick laughed. "Come and have some tea."</p>

  <p>Greigstein ate sparingly. He was full of the moorland and its mysterious
  paths and deep morasses. Would Dick take him there and teach him the paths?
  He was wildly enthusiastic, but there was something in his eyes that told of
  a strange earnestness in the matter. Strange that nearly everybody who came
  along wanted to know something about that mysterious moorland. Was there some
  treasure hidden there or some crime beyond solution?</p>

  <p>"Oh, we shall see," Dick said. "I'm bored over the moor. My employer is
  always talking about it, and so is Mr. Martlett. Do you know him?</p>

  <p>"The name seems familiar," Greigstein said, coolly, as he cracked an egg.
  "Solicitor to the Stanmere estates, I fancy."</p>

  <p>Greigstein's expression was bland and childlike, his glasses twinkled
  benevolently. He changed the conversation in his light and airy way. He was
  going to stay till the last train. He had no intention of going away empty
  handed. If his good friends could give him some supper he would go out
  afterwards moth-hunting. There was no reason why they should not all go out
  moth-hunting.</p>

  <p>The moon was a thin crescent in the sky, a long bank of mist lay like a
  blanket over the Stanmere Woods. They came presently to the avenue leading up
  to the house with the great forest trees hanging over to the right, past the
  lake, sleeping now like a great mirror in the dim light.</p>

  <p>Greigstein had abandoned himself entirely to the work of the moment. He
  was no longer a mysterious German with a fancy for hiding himself in a dingy
  London purlieu, but an enthusiast. He took from his pocket a bottle
  containing a slimy-looking liquid.</p>

  <p>"Treacle," he explained. "We smear the trees thus and thus. Nothing draws
  the moths like that. And presently we shall come back again and collect our
  prey. I will show you something then!"</p>

  <p>They had grown more silent now, Dick had caught the spirit of the sport.
  Greigstein produced a lantern from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I'll push back the slide of this presently," he said. "Then you will see
  a pretty sight. But here is somebody coming, and we are on private property.
  I have no wish to be expelled by a zealous menial. We will obliterate
  ourselves."</p>

  <p>The strange figure came swaggering along up the avenue. He paused for a
  moment before the tree against which the little party were pressing, and
  lighted a cigarette. The match illuminated his features with a dull red glow.
  An almost inarticulate cry came from Molly as the stranger passed.</p>

  <p>"Why did you pinch me like that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It was that man's face," Greigstein whispered, hoarsely. "Did you see his
  features? Of all the cruel nighthawks on the wing now there is none more
  false or cruel than he."</p>

  <p>Molly shuddered. There was something ominous in Greigstein's words. She
  and Dick had both seen that face in the red halo of the vesta. A handsome,
  cruel, shifty face, a face not to be forgotten.</p>

  <p>"It was far better if they had trusted me," Greigstein whispered.
  Obviously, he was talking to himself, he had entirely forgotten his
  companions. "Headstrong and rash I may be, but I could have saved this. He
  was going to the house."</p>

  <p>"A friend of one of the servants, perhaps," Molly suggested.</p>

  <p>"Friend to nobody but himself," Greigstein cried, coming to himself with a
  start. "He is going to the house. He must not go to the house."</p>

  <p>Greigstein darted away and was lost in the darkness. Molly crept near to
  Dick, as if fearful of something evil.</p>

  <p>"I shall know that face again," Dick muttered. "I shall never forget it
  any more."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; A COUNTERFEIT PRESENTMENT.</h2>

  <p>Molly held Dick tightly by the arm. She was not exactly frightened, but
  recent events were getting on her nerves. She and Dick seemed to have drifted
  into the heart of a great mystery from whence there appeared to be no avenue
  of escape. The air was full of a suggestion of tragedy, at every turn the
  grim phantom loomed. If there had been anything definite to go upon, Molly
  would have cared less. She was like a young soldier pressing on the enemy in
  the dark, with the danger all about her and no point at which to strike.</p>

  <p>"I shall dream about that face," she said.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps the sudden glare illuminated its bad points," Dick said. "And no
  doubt you would have thought less of it had not Greigstein gone off in so
  mysterious a manner. I'd give sixpence to know who that chap really is."</p>

  <p>"But he was greatly upset," Molly urged. "He was almost frightened. Dick,
  I think we had better go home."</p>

  <p>Dick hesitated. The artistic temperament is never without its strong
  leaven of curiosity, and he was anxious to know more. At any rate, they might
  finish their walk by way of the shrubbery. It was a private path, but they
  had always been allowed to use it in the days of the late rector. Molly
  caught Dick's arm again and hastened him on.</p>

  <p>They were almost under the shadow of the house by now. The house loomed
  above them, the windows were filled with lights. It was hot and still, and
  the casements were wide open to catch the breeze. Dick lingered, pleased with
  the artistic beauties of the picture. There was the dining-room with its oak
  and silver and artistic confusion of dessert upon the table, the shaded lamps
  flooding the banks of flowers, the glow of red wine in cut-glass vessels.</p>

  <p>"It's all a picture," Dick murmured. "There is nothing in the world more
  artistic and refined than a well-appointed English home. Look how those
  paintings&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused as Molly gripped his arm.</p>

  <p>"Look at the end of the table," the girl said. "Who stands there talking
  to somebody who is smoking a cigar and reclining in an armchair? His face is
  in the shadow just for a moment. Ah! now he has moved."</p>

  <p>Dick looked attentively for a moment, then he caught some of Molly's
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"I can guess," she said, "my instinct tells me. Dick, who was that we saw
  this afternoon talking to our German friend?"</p>

  <p>"Why, Martlett, of course," Dick replied.</p>

  <p>"Well, it is Mr. Martlett who is in that armchair. I can only see his
  hands, but I feel quite certain that I am right. Depend upon it, Mr. Martlett
  is down here to meet that man who seems to be so little at his ease. I should
  not wonder if he came to see Lady Stanmere and found the family lawyer
  instead. I wonder if the cloud of mystery and misery will ever lift from this
  unhappy family?"</p>

  <p>Dick said nothing, he was taking in the scene before him with all his
  eyes. It was quite wrong, of course, but it suggested many possibilities in
  the way of a story. Dick looked along the whole facade of the house, past the
  blank spaces to the drawing-room, the windows of which were open, but nobody
  appeared to be there.</p>

  <p>"You are quite right, Molly," he said. "It looks perfect, a place to be
  envied, a place to dream about; but, in our quiet way we are much happier
  than the poor people here. The larger the house the greater the skeleton. No
  wonder Lady Stanmere is fond of the quiet harbor by the lake."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for Lady Stanmere," said Molly. "If I could help
  her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused and started as a figure came apparently out of nowhere. It was
  impossible to distinguish the outline for a moment after gazing at the lights
  ahead.</p>

  <p>"No occasion for alarm," Greigstein said. "I have made an absurd mistake.
  The man we saw was not coming here at all; in fact&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are wrong," Dick said, coolly. "The fellow is at present in the
  dining-room yonder, and unless I am greatly mistaken, is having a bad quarter
  of an hour at the hands of our friend Mr. Martlett."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" the discomfited Greigstein replied. "Bless me, is that so? Under the
  circumstances of the case we cannot do better than to leave him there. It is
  no concern of ours."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not of mine!" Dick retorted. "But as to yourself, that seems to
  be quite another matter. There is too much mystery for my taste
  here&mdash;too much of a suggestion that I am being made use of. You have
  been a good friend of mine, and I am not ungrateful. But if there is anything
  wrong&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I swear to you that there is nothing wrong," Greigstein cried. "I swear
  that I am doing my best for a good and honorable family. I would speak if I
  only dared, but the secret is not my own. More I can't say."</p>

  <p>"Not even to enlighten us as to your own past?"</p>

  <p>"My past is my own, and I am not ashamed of it," Greigstein said, stiffly.
  "My dear boy, do not let us quarrel; it would be a great grief to me if there
  was any coldness between us. You may not believe me, you don't believe in me,
  but your opinion is not shared by Miss Molly."</p>

  <p>"I am sure you are our good friend," Molly said, sweetly.</p>

  <p>Greigstein bowed. He was silent for a moment, but not for long. There were
  some trees by the lake that he must positively visit. Then they would go home
  to supper and spend a pleasant evening. It was impossible to resist
  Greigstein's good humor and to refuse a laugh over his enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"But there is far too much noise," the professor said. "We will collect
  our spoil and examine it in the summer-house by the lake. I love these
  expeditions; they make one feel like a poacher. Most people have sympathy
  with poachers."</p>

  <p>Greigstein grabbed the spoil from the trees dexterously. There was one
  large white moth that moved him to a high degree of excitement. No specimen
  of that kind had been taken to England for eleven years. Greigstein was
  diffuse, and dwelt on the subject as the trio moved to the summer-house.</p>

  <p>"Now to give you a lesson," the little German cried. "Hand over the
  lantern. Dick, will you kindly throw those rays this&mdash;Lady
  Stanmere!"</p>

  <p>The great white moth dropped to the floor, fluttered its wings, and was
  gone. The light of the lantern fell on the white face and grey hair of Lady
  Stanmere. She had been sitting there in the darkness all alone. The sorrowful
  features were a little hard and set just now; the eyes had a haughty look in
  them.</p>

  <p>"Von Wrangel," she said. There was a painful confusion on Greigstein's
  face. "Why do you come here? Am I never to be left alone?"</p>

  <p>"I assure you," Greigstein stammered, "I assure you that it was the merest
  accident. I did not dream anyone would be here to-night. I merely came here
  to have a look at my specimens. We will go at once&mdash;with the deepest of
  apologies we will retire without delay."</p>

  <p>There was a scarlet flush on the speaker's face; he turned abruptly with a
  suggestion of bustling his young friends out of the summer-house. Even to a
  less astute mind than Lady Stanmere's the intention was painfully
  obvious.</p>

  <p>"Stay a moment," she said. There was a ring of command in her voice. "I am
  quite certain that nobody is to blame. I was startled and angry for the
  moment. It is one of my whims to come here on a fine evening&mdash;my husband
  was fond of the place. But I am not quite the recluse you take me for; for
  instance, I am not so shut up that I fail to recognise these young people as
  old acquaintances of mine. And we have met before. My dear child, come
  here."</p>

  <p>Greigstein groaned, and Dick heard him with a certain cynical amusement.
  The German's confusion and his wild attempt to get them away had not been
  lost on the astute young man. Molly crossed over to Lady Stanmere, who kissed
  her tenderly.</p>

  <p>"You have a sweet face," she said, "beautiful and amiable like your
  mother's, and a certain firmness that suggests your father. I lost a good
  friend the day he died. So you have come back again here?"</p>

  <p>Molly explained. Dick was now in a position to live in the country again;
  a thing they had always regretted was dear old Stanmere.</p>

  <p>"You must come and see me," Lady Stanmere said. "I am a lonely old woman,
  and it will be a pleasure to have somebody young about me again. I am glad
  you came here to-night. To me it seems like Providence."</p>

  <p>As she spoke she glanced at Greigstein. He looked down quietly at the
  moths that seemed no longer to interest him. Lady Stanmere rose and placed
  her arm in that of Molly.</p>

  <p>"It is getting quite chilly," she said. "My dear, you are going to help me
  as far as the house. I may keep you there for a little chat for half an hour
  or so, because I go to bed very early. When I am asleep I can forget. Your
  brother can wait for you by the laurel gate."</p>

  <p>The two disappeared together. By the light of the lantern Dick studied his
  companion's face. A schoolboy caught stealing apples, a fisherman with a
  broken line, something of that sort Greigstein might have sat for.</p>

  <p>"A penny for your thoughts," said Dick, dryly.</p>

  <p>"Extravagant!" Greigstein growled. "Young man, I am in a dangerous mood,
  as most people are when they take themselves to be wise and find themselves
  dolts instead. You chaff me any more and I take that handsome curly head of
  yours and bang him against the wall. I have lost my big moth, I have
  lost&mdash;no, there he is. Give me the lantern quick. You come this way.
  So."</p>

  <p>"I give you up," Dick laughed. "You are too strange a mixture for any man
  to properly understand. And yet at the same time," he concluded, sotto voce,
  "I am not going to forget that Lady Stanmere called you Von Wrangel."</p>

  <p>But Greigstein was ahead and in hot pursuit of the white moth. There was a
  gurgle of satisfaction as the specimen was captured. For the next half hour
  Greigstein talked a scientific jargon that Dick made no pretence of
  understanding. It seemed to him that Greigstein was talking for the sake of
  making speech, as if he dreaded questions on quite another topic. It might
  have been a sigh of relief or a sigh of pleasure that he gave when Molly's
  white dress loomed in sight.</p>

  <p>"You found her ladyship charming?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"As ever," Molly replied. "You seem to forget that I have been at Stanmere
  before. Lady Stanmere used to spoil me dreadfully when I was a child. Now,
  let us get along to supper&mdash;it's past ten o'clock."</p>

  <p>But Greigstein regretted that he must change his plans. He had meant to
  stay till the last train, but he had forgotten an important letter he had to
  write. If he hurried to the station he would catch the 11.15. He was
  desolate; but there was no help for it, he must go at once.</p>

  <p>He started hard down the road for a little way, then stopped, listening
  intently. A moment later he was back in the park again with his face in the
  direction of the house.</p>

  <p>Molly was a little silent on her homeward walk.</p>

  <p>"You are very quiet," Dick said at length.</p>

  <p>"Am I?" Molly asked. "Dick, I have made a discovery. Do you remember the
  photograph of Mary Gay you brought home that night?"</p>

  <p>"I am not likely to forget it," Dick said, quietly.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's a strange thing, but a large portrait of Mary hangs in Lady
  Stanmere's drawing-room."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; A FRIEND IN NEED.</h2>

  <p>Dick heard what Molly had to say with no feeling of surprise. Had the
  blind Mary risen from the roadside before him he would have felt no
  astonishment. His life was in some way bound up with that of the girl who had
  so fascinated him; that they would come together sooner or later he felt
  certain.</p>

  <p>"I can't forget her," he said, "and indeed I would not if I could. So
  sweet and pathetic, so lonely and mysterious. And there is something like a
  great tragedy revolving round the poor girl. Did Lady Stanmere mention
  her?"</p>

  <p>"Not directly," Molly replied. "But more than once she looked from the
  photograph to myself, and seemed on the point of asking a question. Oh, if we
  could only get at the bottom of it!"</p>

  <p>Dick walked on in silence. Before the door of the cottage a boy stood with
  an orange-hued envelope in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Telegram for you, sir," he said. "Special messenger from Formby, and a
  shilling to pay."</p>

  <p>With a feeling that something was going to happen, Dick tore open the
  envelope. It was a message from the Record office. There was an extra
  pressure of work, and Stevenson was to come up at once, if possible. There
  was just a chance to catch the last train up from Stanmere.</p>

  <p>"No supper," Dick said, briefly. "This is one of the joys of being a
  journalist. But anyway, it's better than Pant-street."</p>

  <p>He caught up his hat and coat and shot off into the darkness.
  Five-and-twenty minutes later he was in the noise and glare of Fleet street.
  It was a strange contrast to the sylvan quietness of Stanmere. The Record
  office was humming like a hive; down below the machines were rattling and
  roaring. The only quiet spot appeared to be the office of the editor. The
  place looked prim and green and subdued, under its shaded lights.</p>

  <p>"I came up as soon as I got your telegram, sir," Dick remarked to the
  figure under the green shade. "If there is anything that I could
  do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Got no telegram from me," the editor said, curtly. "Try Mr. Spencer, who
  is here unusually late to-night. I'm busy."</p>

  <p>The hint was plain and Dick took it promptly. The owner of the record was
  in his office drawing abstractedly on a sheet of 'copy' paper. He looked
  terribly pale and agitated, as disturbed as he had been when Dick had first
  met him in Cambria square.</p>

  <p>"I had a telegram, sir," Dick began. "Mr. Fisher&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Spencer looked up abstractedly. He seemed to see nothing but the
  shadow of despair out of those sombre eyes of his. Then it was borne in upon
  him that he was no longer alone.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," he said. He breathed as if he had run hard and fast. "I sent
  for you&mdash;the business has nothing to do with the office. The man I could
  best trust is not in London to-night. Can I trust you?"</p>

  <p>Dick met the troubled eyes firmly. It was impossible not to feel sorry for
  the speaker. Here was a millionaire philanthropist, a man of good name and
  widely respected, who carried about with him a trouble that his obscure
  companion would not have borne for all Golconda.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I see I can," Spencer went on; "you are very like your father.
  I lied to you when I said I did not know him, because I knew him very well
  indeed. My boy, I am in trouble, such a trouble as few men dream of. And all
  for one passing indiscretion. God knows, I have expiated that crime in
  remorse and sorrow. But it will be with me always. And, like most crimes,
  mine affects the happiness of others. If I am found out now, one of the most
  delicate fabrics falls to the ground. Two or three years hence and it would
  not matter. Anyone is welcome to drag my sin into the light of day then. Do
  you understand&mdash;this thing must be concealed?"</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry," Dick stammered. "You have been very good to me, and I
  will serve you with my whole heart and soul. You are in danger&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Imminent danger. The blow may fall now for all I know. Dick, you are
  strong and resolute. You must help me to avert it."</p>

  <p>Spencer's voice sunk to a half-pleading, piteous whisper. In the lamplight
  his face was shining as the great beads rolled down his cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I will do anything you ask me," Dick cried.</p>

  <p>"Ah, I was sure you would. Not that I am going to tell you my secret, the
  secret of my life. It is for my daughter that I require your aid."</p>

  <p>Dick thrilled. Here was his chance at last. From the very first he was
  destined to see Mary again; he had felt that in his heart, and it had been no
  idle dream. His face flushed with sheer delight.</p>

  <p>"I stumbled on my danger near my house as I came from my walk to-night,"
  Spencer went on. "My danger was watching the house, so that I dared not
  return. I came here scarcely knowing what to do. To return home was
  impossible until the coast was clear. Then I sent for you."</p>

  <p>"You could have found no more faithful servant, sir."</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it. You have resolution and courage, and you are a gentleman
  besides. Your sister is as good and true as yourself. . . . . It would be a
  splendid thing to hide at Stanmere. . . . To double on one's tracks like a
  thief near the scene of his crime . . . And then there are the trackless
  moors where one could hide. . . . . ." The speaker was talking to himself.
  Evidently he had forgotten all about Dick. His lips were moving, but no
  further sound came. The quick purr of a telephone bell in the room startled
  him.</p>

  <p>"Go and answer it," he said, hoarsely, to Dick. "I dare not do it myself.
  It is my private wire from Cambria square. If I could only think! God grant
  that I do not get one of my brain attacks to-night."</p>

  <p>Dick crossed the room and took down the receiver. He felt spurred on and
  braced up with the knowledge that he had been approved and chosen. He felt
  very near to the blind girl now.</p>

  <p>"Are you there?" he asked. "Who is it? Who am I? Richard Stevenson, who
  speaks to you from Mr. Spencer's private room. He has asked me to speak for
  him."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad of it, sir," came a strange voice. "If my master had taken my
  advice you would have been impressed into the service before. I'm Kant,
  sir."</p>

  <p>Dick knew the voice now; it was Spencer's mysterious servant, the man who
  had taken Mary's photograph from him and advised him not to come near Cambria
  square again. He listened impatiently.</p>

  <p>"The danger is still here," Kent went on, "outside waiting. Tell Mr.
  Spencer that I will do anything he likes, but I can't think of a way out. I
  can guard and watch with anybody, but I cannot scheme. If the young lady was
  only out of the way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop a minute," Dick exclaimed. "I'll call you again presently." He hung
  up the receiver, and turned to his employer. He had fallen back in his chair
  a picture of abject despair. A shake of the shoulder failed to move him. And
  Dick felt that moments were precious.</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake, arouse yourself," he said. "You say that everything
  depends upon the next few hours. You may save the situation yet. Your man
  Kant tells me that everything depends upon getting your your daughter away.
  Your daughter! Mary, Mary!"</p>

  <p>The name moved Spencer. He nodded feebly.</p>

  <p>"That is true," he groaned. "But how is it going to be done?"</p>

  <p>"I am thinking of a way; in fact, I have practically done so. Dear sir, I
  do not seek to pry into your secrets, but I must know a little more if I am
  to be successful. Some danger menaces your daughter, some spy is watching
  outside. That spy has guessed something."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," Spencer said, eagerly. "That is it."</p>

  <p>"So far, so good. What we have to do now is to get your daughter away from
  under the very eyes of the spy. A little boldness and audacity may succeed.
  Tell me, does Miss Spencer know anything of this danger?"</p>

  <p>"To a certain extent, yes. I have told her that I have a remorseless
  enemy. Once in Paris and again in San Francisco we had to steal away. If you
  go to Mary with a message to that effect from me she will follow you."</p>

  <p>Dick thrilled again. The idea of having the blind girl under his care set
  his pulses drumming. And he was going to succeed.</p>

  <p>"I will do it," he said. "You can trust your child to me?"</p>

  <p>"I will trust my child to you implicitly."</p>

  <p>"You will never have cause to repent it, sir," Dick said, as steadily as
  possible. "She shall go down with me to Stanmere, and Molly shall look after
  her."</p>

  <p>"That is it," Spencer cried. "That is the idea. . . . And you know all
  those woodland paths, where nobody else dare go. Take her and shield her as
  you would the most precious thing in your possession. If you only knew the
  tremendous interests that revolve round that poor blind girl! Now go."</p>

  <p>Dick stepped across to the telephone. He had hardly got the receiver to
  his ear before Kant responded from the other end.</p>

  <p>"Is the danger still there?" Dick asked.</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay," came the startling reply; "the danger is in the house. Nothing
  has happened yet, but at any moment the explosion may occur. For goodness'
  sake, sir, tell me what to do."</p>

  <p>Dick thought it out for a moment. His scheme was getting pretty clear.</p>

  <p>"Does the danger take the form of a man who is the alter ego&mdash;I mean
  the second self of your master?" he asked. "It does? You have prevaricated,
  of course. Tell me what you have said."</p>

  <p>"I am a servant of a gentleman who has this flat. My own master I am
  supposed to have left long ago. Heaven forgive all these lies."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid they are necessary," Dick replied. "But we need have as few
  as possible. You are expecting your master, and he is coming. Do not express
  any astonishment, try and follow the lead that I shall give you. Fortunately,
  I recollect the way into Mr. Spencer's flat. Where is your visitor?"</p>

  <p>"He is in the morning-room smoking a cigar. Make haste, sir. I dare not
  stay so far away as the telephone is any longer. When I think of the peril
  that a wall a few inches thick divides, I feel cold all over. Come at once,
  sir; take a cab and let us get to work. This is terribly trying to the
  nerves."</p>

  <p>Dick turned away from the telephone, blessing it as he did so. It seemed
  to him that he had conveyed quite as much to Kant as was necessary.</p>

  <p>"I am ready to go now," he said.</p>

  <p>"Youth and a clear conscience!" Spencer cried. "What precious possessions
  they are! What would I not give to have them again!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Dick had reached the street and hailed a hansom. A few minutes
  later and he was in Cambria square. His heart was beating a little faster
  now, but he was cool and resolute. He reached the flat at length, and stood
  listening for voices. He heard that of Kant at length behind a door, the
  handle of which he turned and walked in with the air of a master.</p>

  <p>"What does this mean, Kant?" he demanded. "Where was the brougham? And
  James puts the blame upon you. I shall be glad of an explanation."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; A VISITOR.</h2>

  <p>Released from his polite attentions to the startled Venner, the man called
  Stephen walked thoughtfully away. He looked like one who had some sudden
  shock, as if a trouble had been chastened by some unexpected joy.</p>

  <p>He began to pick his steps more cautiously presently, for ever glancing
  over his shoulder, fearful of seeing something undesirable behind. It was not
  exactly the action of a criminal, and yes the man was afraid of something
  that threatened his life.</p>

  <p>He was by no means a bad-looking man if his face had been less reckless.
  Here was a man who would go any length if the spirit moved him, a man who
  could hate well and love well, and give no heed to the future once his
  passions ran with a loose rein. Presently he ceased to look over his shoulder
  and his eyes grew introspective.</p>

  <p>"This is a fine piece of luck," he muttered. "If that scoundrel told the
  truth&mdash;and I see no reason why he should not&mdash;I have found the
  object of my search. Fancy blundering on the scent in this fashion after all
  these years! What shall I do with him? Kill him? That would be a poor kind of
  vengeance and gives the victim little pain. Hand him over to the tender
  mercies of Horace Venner perhaps. If ever I saw blackmail and the knowledge
  that it was going to be successful I saw it on Venner's face to-night. . . .
  But I have to find my quarry first. After all Cambria square is a trifle
  vague."</p>

  <p>The speaker came to his destination at length. For some time he lingered
  under a lamp until the suspicious glance of a policeman moved him on. In the
  hope that he was sure of his ground, the man had been hanging about here for
  days. Now he was certain. But it was no use to hide in the square gardens as
  he had done before. He twisted a cigarette and prepared to wait. His luck was
  in to-night, and he was going to follow it up. His patience was not to be
  unduly tried.</p>

  <p>A man in a quiet undress livery came slowly down the road. He was smoking
  a cigar and looked exactly what he was&mdash;a good-class servant enjoying
  his hour or so off duty. The watcher slackened his pace a little so that the
  other man might go by him. There was a furtive look and a sudden gleam in the
  eyes of the loiterer.</p>

  <p>"Kant," he said to himself. "The astute, faithful, inestimable Kant! As
  the jackal is so near, the lion is not far off. It would seem as if things
  were prosperous with my dear, affectionate relative. I will follow Kant, and
  when he has finished his cigar he will go back to the house again. Where does
  all this prosperity come from?"</p>

  <p>The cigar was finished at length, and Kant retraced his steps. He
  disappeared into the vestibule of a palatial pile of flats, and then the
  other man followed. It might be a little difficult if Kant availed himself of
  the lift, but fortunately the lift had just started for an upper floor, so
  that Kant walked up the stone stairs.</p>

  <p>"Isn't going very far up then," the tracker muttered. "Evidently my
  esteemed friend has one of the best of the suites here. Well, before long, he
  will be ready to exchange it for a hovel in Shoreditch. Ah, here we are!"</p>

  <p>Kant passed down a corridor into a morning-room, the other man following
  close behind. In an instant the door was shut and locked. Kant turned in some
  surprise to see a tall, gaunt figure standing before him. There was a mocking
  smile on the stranger's face. Just for an instant Kant turned pale; just for
  the fraction of a second there was a startled expression on his face. It was
  as if a fine fencer had been taken off his guard. But it was only just for an
  instant.</p>

  <p>"You have been expecting me, Kant?" the new-comer said.</p>

  <p>Kant bowed his head, the very model of a well-trained servant. It was
  impossible to associate him with disreputable secrets. He might have gone
  bail for the respectability of the household. He moved so as to get before
  the other door leading from the room.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to see you, Mr. Stephen," he said. He was absolutely cold now,
  not at all like a man who has rehearsed this scene many times over. "I am
  glad to see that you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pshaw!&mdash;that I have not been hanged yet, Kant. You have some very
  snug quarters here. Your master is evidently doing a good thing for himself.
  Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"At present he is out, sir. Do you happen to know him, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Know him! Of all the audacious rascals! Why, you will tell me next that
  you are not a factotum, ally, fellow-conspirator, all the rest of it!"</p>

  <p>"My master's name, sir, is Spencer. I had to look to myself, sir. There
  are others depending upon me."</p>

  <p>"You lying rascal, where is your master?"</p>

  <p>"My master is out, sir," Kant went on in the same bland tones. "And I beg
  to remark, Mr. Stephen, that, even a servant has his feelings. You would have
  been more popular at home had you remembered that fact, sir. Your late father
  would never have spoken like that."</p>

  <p>The reproof was dignified and in the best possible taste. Stephen Stanmere
  shot a keen glance at Kant, but it was impossible to penetrate that armour
  again. The man's nerve was perfect, he was absolutely on his guard; behind
  that dull mask his brain was working rapidly.</p>

  <p>"I apologise," the intruder said. "I have been far beyond schools of
  manners lately. All the same, I am going to stay here till your master
  returns."</p>

  <p>Kant bowed. From somewhere a little way off a clear voice was singing, a
  sweet and well-trained voice, to the accompaniment of a piano.</p>

  <p>"That is your mistress, I presume?" Stanmere sneered.</p>

  <p>"If you would like to see her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not I! I am still sufficiently civilised not to venture into the company
  of a lady in this sorry garb. Still there is something in the voice&mdash;but
  that is impossible. Still I shall find that all out when I see your
  master."</p>

  <p>There was a grim earnestness about the last few words, but they seemed to
  make no impression on Kant.</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir," he said. "If you know my master, well and good. If you
  don't care to go into the drawing-room, can I get you anything here? A cigar,
  sir, or a glass of whisky and soda-water?"</p>

  <p>Stephen Stanmere nodded. He was not feeling quite so sure of his ground
  now. The voice of the singer at the piano charmed him.</p>

  <p>"Whisky and soda," he said, "and a cigar if it is a good one. It is just
  possible that I am a victim of a singular coincidence&mdash;'Thou art so near
  and yet so far,' and all that kind of thing. But I am going to leave nothing
  to chance."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir. I will get you what you require, Mr. Stephen."</p>

  <p>Kant walked away in his own cool, deliberate fashion. But as he quietly
  closed the door behind him he turned the well-oiled key in the lock
  noiselessly. His mask-like face was instantly covered with a fine
  perspiration. He flew to the telephone in the closet at the end of the
  passage and stood there quivering with expectation.</p>

  <p>So far so good. He had only to wait now for developments. Help was at
  hand, he would have an ally that he could depend upon. All he had to do now
  was to keep his eyes open and take up the cue that the new-comer would give
  him. There was no trace of agitation about him as he came back presently with
  the refreshments.</p>

  <p>"I ought not to have let you go," Stanmere said, suspiciously. "Still you
  could not do much harm seeing that I am in possession. Your
  master&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will be home in a few minutes, sir, now," Kant said, coolly. "He is here
  now."</p>

  <p>The door flew open and a handsome young man came in. In his tweed suit and
  with a long coat over his arm he had evidently come off a journey. He seemed
  to be in a fine temper, he had eyes for Kant alone.</p>

  <p>"What does this mean?" he demanded. "Where is the brougham? James put the
  blame on to you. If this happens again Kant&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Kant spread out his hands helplessly. His face was downcast, but his heart
  beat with fierce delight.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; FENCING.</h2>

  <p>There was no reason to repeat the question, no cause so much as to raise
  an eyeglass. Kant had taken up his cue perfectly.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry, Mr. Spencer, sir," Kant said, humbly, and Dick knew that
  it would be wise of him to respond to the name of Spencer, which meant
  nothing after all. "James muddled up the order, sir. If there is anything
  that I can do, sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, only to see that my evening dress is all laid out for me at
  once. I presume that your mistress is ready. I don't want to keep her
  waiting."</p>

  <p>"My mistress is in the drawing-room, sir."</p>

  <p>The stranger followed with a feeling that something was slipping away from
  him. Just for a moment it occurred to him that here was part of some subtle
  scheme for throwing dust in his eyes. He thought it all over in the quickness
  of a flash. And yet it could be hardly possible. Only just for the fraction
  of a second had Kant been taken by surprise, and that might have been caused
  by finding himself suddenly face to face with an old acquaintance. And this
  young man had come in with a sudden air of possession, he looked well and
  prosperous, and, again, there was the voice in the drawing-room. Mr. Spencer
  was a young man of the upper middle class, and the singer was his wife. And
  they were going out presently to some late function. The outsider was growing
  uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"Well, don't let it occur again," Dick cried. "And I shall be glad if you
  will find some other place to entertain your friends, Kant."</p>

  <p>"Gentleman no friend of mine, sir," Kant responded. "Says he knows you,
  sir."</p>

  <p>Kant disappeared discreetly with a comfortable assurance that he was
  leaving matters in capable hands.</p>

  <p>"Glad they sent him," he muttered. "There's grit and pluck and brains
  there. We are going to pull through this time, but it has been touch and
  go."</p>

  <p>Dick turned to the intruder somewhat haughtily.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid there has been a mistake, sir," he said. "I do not know
  you."</p>

  <p>"The advantage is quite mutual," Stanmere replied. "I&mdash;I came here
  under a misapprehension. I am looking for somebody who I am certain lives
  close here, possibly under this very roof. I don't suppose you have ever seen
  me before, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dick took a pace or two forward. The game was entirely in his own hands
  now if he only played it boldly. The man was the enemy of his benefactor, the
  strange man with the amazing likeness to the individual who called himself
  Mr. Spencer.</p>

  <p>"I do know you," Dick cried. "By accident I was passing through Cambria
  square a few nights ago and I saw you make a murderous attack upon a
  gentleman there. If I had not come up in time you would have killed him. By
  sheer good luck you escaped from my hands, or you would have been fitly
  adorning a gaol by this time. What are you doing here, you cowardly
  ruffian?"</p>

  <p>Stanmere muttered something. He was taken utterly by surprise. He had not
  expected this, and it was so overpoweringly true. He no longer swaggered with
  the certainty that he was on the right scent. There was a possibility of the
  police being called and he being given into custody.</p>

  <p>"You know too much and too little," he said, hoarsely. "Rest assured of
  the fact that the man you speak of would never come forward to charge me. If
  he were here at this moment you would see him here at my feet pleading for
  mercy."</p>

  <p>There was a sincerity about this speech that struck Dick forcibly. And
  from his own knowledge of the complicated mystery he knew it was true.
  Otherwise, why Mr. Spencer's pitiable fear of meeting this man?</p>

  <p>"I have no more than your word for that," Dick said, coldly. "Nor have you
  satisfactorily explained why you are here at this moment."</p>

  <p>"Well, I followed Kant in here," Stanmere said, lamely.</p>

  <p>"I know you did. But why?"</p>

  <p>"Because Kant was ever the devoted servant of my&mdash;of the man I am
  looking for. And I did not believe Kant when he told me he had changed
  situations. I did not believe him till you came into the room, and then I saw
  my mistake. All I can do is to tender you my most sincere apologies and leave
  the house without delay."</p>

  <p>Dick bowed coldly. Stanmere took up his seedy hat and made for the door,
  with what dignity he could assume under the circumstances. He passed out into
  the corridor, where he paused for a moment with his nose in the air.</p>

  <p>"Strange, very strange," he muttered. "The voice was familiar, and yet it
  could not be. And here is the scent of the violets that that she loved so
  well. One might say that there are other women who are fond of the smell of
  violets, but&mdash;Well, I'll wait. If those two people are going out
  presently, I'll not go till I am certain."</p>

  <p>Dick breathed a little easier to find himself alone. Directly the outer
  door closed Kant came in. His features glowed with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"You did that splendidly, sir," he said; "but it was a very near
  thing."</p>

  <p>"The danger is by no means over," Dick replied. "I forced that man to go
  away&mdash;indeed under the circumstances he could not stay. But if I could
  judge anything from the expression of his face, he was far from satisfied. He
  did not come here to-night without some good ground for doing so. He has only
  been choked off for the moment. Kant, that man must be satisfied, we must
  make him feel that he is wrong. I am ready to forfeit my whole scheme if you
  don't find him still looking about the square."</p>

  <p>"Better go and see, sir?" Kant suggested.</p>

  <p>Dick nodded. Kant was some little time away. When he came back his face
  was grave.</p>

  <p>"You are quite right," he said. "Our friend is still there. What's to be
  done now, and what on earth is he waiting for?"</p>

  <p>"He is going to see your mistress and myself depart," Dick said, "and he
  shall not be disappointed."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; A PERFECT CONFIDENCE.</h2>

  <p>Dick walked into the drawing-room with a heart that was beating fast. The
  room was familiar to him as if he had seen it a hundred times. During that
  one brief visit the whole perfect picture had been photographed on his mind.
  Here were all the dainty ornaments, the pictures, the palms and the flowers
  everywhere. As before the whole atmosphere was redolent with the smell of
  flowers.</p>

  <p>At the piano Mary sat ringing some simple pathetic air to her own
  accompaniment. There was a slight smile on her beautiful face, the clear blue
  eyes seemed full of expression. Gently as Dick crept into the room, the girl
  heard him, and stopped instantly.</p>

  <p>"It is Mr. Stevenson," she said quite naturally. "The gentleman who was so
  kind to my father the other night. I am so very glad to see you."</p>

  <p>She came forward quite naturally as if she had sight to see like other
  people. Dick felt quite dazed for a moment and could say nothing whilst
  holding that little hand in his.</p>

  <p>"Did you actually recollect my step!" he stammered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," Mary smiled. "I have a fine feeling for that kind of thing. One
  sense always increases as another is injured. I hope you have no bad news for
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you suggest that?" Dick asked. "Because your voice is not quite
  steady," Mary said. "And because nobody comes here. And my father has not yet
  returned. I hope he is not ill."</p>

  <p>"Your father is perfectly well," Dick replied. "But he has sent me here.
  Miss Mary, he has taken me into his confidence."</p>

  <p>"It is more than he has done for me," Mary said, with a sad little smile.
  "He is a good man; and I love him dearly, but there is a chapter of his life
  that I have not been permitted to read as yet. The dark secret that hangs
  over our lives."</p>

  <p>"Is a secret from me also," Dick said. "More than once it has been
  necessary for you to leave a place hurriedly, and ask no questions. Do you
  call them to mind, Miss Mary?"</p>

  <p>"Twice&mdash;once in Paris and once in San Francisco. There is a Nemesis
  somewhere that dogs us, and we have to fly. But I thought that was all over.
  Is it coming again?"</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady, it has come to-night. Your father has sent you a
  message by me. You are to come with me and ask no questions. The danger is
  very much alive again. If it falls it will bring ruin upon many people
  concerned. You are not afraid?"</p>

  <p>The girl shivered and turned a little pale. The blue eyes had grown very
  pathetic. She gave a longing look about the room as if she could see all the
  familiar objects before her.</p>

  <p>"You do not hesitate to trust me?" Dick asked.</p>

  <p>A little white hand crept along Dick's sleeve and rested in his fingers.
  The touch thrilled him and brought the colour into his face. The action was
  so pretty, so full of confidence.</p>

  <p>"I trust you implicitly," the girl said. "You are kind and honorable, my
  father says, and he knows. And in your voice there is a ring that I like; a
  ring of feeling and sincerity. It will be a great sorrow to me to leave the
  place where I know everything, but my father knows best. Where are we
  going?"</p>

  <p>"We are going to a place called Shepherd's Spring, at Stanmere."</p>

  <p>Mary's face flushed. She pressed Dick's hand suddenly.</p>

  <p>"I know it," she said. "Oh, I shall be on familiar ground there. I might
  have known that even in the bitterest trouble my father would not forget me.
  I shall be able to walk there and to feel that I know exactly where I am. And
  the people there?"</p>

  <p>"Are my sister and myself. It is a very strange thing, Miss Mary, but when
  you gave me that photograph by mistake my sister recognised it. She was at
  school with you&mdash;Molly Stevenson."</p>

  <p>A little cry of delight came from Mary.</p>

  <p>"My dear girl," she said. "I was called Mary Gay there because that was
  because my father came into his money and changed his name. And so I am going
  to stay with Molly! If my father is well, I shall be entirely happy at
  Stanmere."</p>

  <p>"Your father is perfectly well and will come to no harm. You can make your
  mind quite easy as to that. And it all rests with yourself."</p>

  <p>Once more the little hand pressed Dick's fingers.</p>

  <p>"You may rely upon me. I am sore afflicted, but you will not find me
  lacking in courage. Only tell me what I am to do."</p>

  <p>"You are to go up to your maid and get her to pack a small valise for you
  that you can carry under your cloak. You are to put on a somewhat elaborate
  evening dress with a certain amount of jewels&mdash;diamonds for
  choice&mdash;say a brooch. The rest of your wardrobe can come later on, so
  long as you have enough for the present. Then you will come down dressed and
  cloaked as if you were going to a party. After that you will go down to a
  carriage that I am getting from a good livery stable close by. In the street
  you will drop your diamond star and find out the loss at once. I shall not
  pretend to see it, and you will point out that it is in the gutter, where I
  shall take care to kick it. It is a lovely starlight night, so when we get
  outside you are to point out the fact to me, especially noticing Charles's
  Wain. Also, you are to have a fleecy, cloudy thing to hide your face. If you
  could manage to assume another voice, say rather a mincing and affected
  voice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can do that easily," Mary cried. "The girls at school used to say
  that I could take off all the mistresses to perfection. How will this do?
  'What a lovely night, Dick!' I know your name is Dick, because your sister
  used to speak of you. 'What a glorious night! Look at Charles's Wain.' Will
  that do?"</p>

  <p>"Splendidly!" Dick cried. "As we get into the carriage you had better turn
  round and remind me that my tie is not on straight. Shall I ring the bell for
  you?"</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour later and Dick was arrayed in one of Mr. Spencer's
  dress suits. The fit was none too good, but a long overcoat hid all
  imperfections, and it was dark outside. At the head of the stairs Mary stood,
  a lovely picture in white satin and diamonds.</p>

  <p>"I hope I shall do," she said, shyly. "I have plenty of beautiful dresses
  that I seldom wear. Do you think that I shall pass the watchful eye that
  waits for us?"</p>

  <p>Dick was absolutely certain of it. He stood with a deep admiration for a
  few minutes. If only Mary could see! Surely hers was the most beautiful face
  in the world. Kant, standing in the background, coughed with discretion.</p>

  <p>"Our man's still there, sir," he said. "And the carriage is at the door.
  We are doing a wrong thing, both of us, but good may come of it, and it won't
  be for long."</p>

  <p>Dick drew Mary's arm through his own, with an injunction to touch him
  lightly. She passed down the stairs and into the street quite blithely. She
  looked from one side to the other. Then her gaze went upwards and she broke
  into raptures on the beauty of the night. It sounded like somebody entirely
  different to Dick as he listened in great admiration. The falling of the
  diamond brooch and the detection of it by Mary were both perfect.</p>

  <p>"And do you know, my dear Dick," she said sweetly, "your white tie is
  under your ear? Those new patent fasteners of yours are quite useless."</p>

  <p>The door of the brougham was banged to and an address in Gloucester Place
  given by Kant, who stood back with a rigid forefinger to his forehead. Mary
  laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>"It is like an adventure," she said. "Did I do that well&mdash;Dick?"</p>

  <p>"Magnificently!" Dick said with emotion. The pair of eyes that gleamed
  malevolently out of the darkness were puzzled yet satisfied, and not a little
  angry. "And if you would always call me Dick&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In future I shall. I am very lonely, Dick, and I have few friends. And if
  you would be good and kind to me, be a brother to me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dick caught the little hand held out to him, and pressed it to his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Always!" he said. "I will never forget you. I will see for you and fight
  for you. But as to being a brother, why, you see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dick stopped abruptly. He was confused and nervous, but on the whole the
  happiest man in England to-night.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; UNDER THE STARS.</h2>

  <p>Small wonder that Dick's heart beat high within him. There had been time
  for day-dreams lately, lying on the heather with the golden meadows leading
  down to Camelot, a brief idyll after those grinding weary years. The breadth,
  the beauty, the purple flash of a swallow wheeling in the blue, all filled
  Dick with a pure delight. He was a young man, strong and sanguine, and he had
  the artistic temperament.</p>

  <p>Small wonder, then, that he should dream and glow and weave his romances
  with a central figure, blue-eyed, fair, and sightless. When the means was won
  Dick would marry Mary, always providing that she would have him, a possible
  factor that chilled the ardent Richard occasionally.</p>

  <p>Mary had been the central figure in so many romances, but never in one
  quite so thrilling as the present reality. He was going to have beautiful
  blind Mary under his own roof for the time being&mdash;an idyll amongst the
  roses, a poem in honey-suckle. Dick was a happy man to-night.</p>

  <p>The carriage drove on until the lamps grew far between and hedges took the
  place of houses. Then came the sweet fragrance of dew-washed grass, a full
  round moon crept like a shield into the sky.</p>

  <p>"Are we going to drive all the way?" Mary asked. She had been strangely
  silent, though her face was calm and untroubled.</p>

  <p>"Every inch of it," Dick replied. "On the whole it is more prudent to do
  so. It is such a glorious night."</p>

  <p>"I felt it," Mary said. "I have a kind of instinct in such things. Cool
  and still and dewy with a brilliant moon overhead. If you say I an wrong, I
  shall be very disappointed, Dick."</p>

  <p>She turned towards him with a wistful little smile that had something
  pathetic in it. She seemed to be conscious of the spot where Dick was
  sitting, for she laid her hand on his.</p>

  <p>"You are perfectly right," he said, eagerly. "How clever you are!"</p>

  <p>Mary smiled again as she patted Dick's fingers. All her life she had seen
  nothing of men with the exception of her father, and all men were like him in
  her sight. What in another girl would have been boldness seemed quite natural
  in her case.</p>

  <p>"I like the touch of your hand, Dick," she said. "So strong and firm and
  kind. You and I are going to be good friends. Is there anyone you love,
  Dick."</p>

  <p>"Molly," said Dick; "and, well, I am going to be very fond of you,
  Mary."</p>

  <p>It cost him an effort not to say more. It really was a lovely night, and
  the thrill in his voice was testimony to his feelings. There was a smell of
  wild thyme on the dewy air. And the touch of those white fingers was
  thrilling. On the whole it was quite time to give the conversation a more
  prosaic turn.</p>

  <p>"We have not so very far to go, now," Dick said. "We are on the top of
  Longmead, and I can see the lights of Stanmere in the valley."</p>

  <p>There came a strange gleam into the sightless blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"Dear old Stanmere," Mary whispered. "I was very happy there. It was all
  vague and mysterious, that coming and going of mine, but I was really happy
  there. All the same, Dick, you must keep me away from Stanmere."</p>

  <p>"Tell me all about it," Dick asked.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I cannot. There is a secret. It is not my secret. Lady
  Stanmere&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" Dick said. "Don't think I am prying. We will talk of something
  else." He was just a shade disappointed. He had asked too much. With her
  quick intuition Mary guessed his feelings.</p>

  <p>"Don't be hurt," she said. "You are so good and kind, and we are going to
  be such good friends. Dick, I think you would do anything for me?"</p>

  <p>"Anything in the wide world," Dick said, with the largeness of romantic
  youth. "If you could only realise what I would do for you!"</p>

  <p>There was another pressure from the slim fingers.</p>

  <p>"Some day it will all come out; some day the truth will be known, and my
  father's character vindicated. But don't talk of Stanmere, Dick, for the mere
  thought of it fills me with remorse. And keep me from the house, though if
  you put me down upon the heath I could find my way there, blind as I am."</p>

  <p>"Only one question," Dick urged. "You lived at Shepherds Spring once?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. We had a kind of holiday there. My father furnished it for me much
  the same as the house in Cambria square is furnished. It was a lovely time.
  Dick, you come from Stanmere. Did you ever known my&mdash;Lady Stanmere's
  sons?"</p>

  <p>Dick replied that he had not had the dubious pleasure.</p>

  <p>They were much older than himself, and he had been a child when they left
  home. There had been a lot of trouble and anxiety over those boys, he
  understood.</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," Mary said sadly. "And yet my father says the wild boys
  often make good men. Are we very near, Dick?"</p>

  <p>"Near enough to see the lights of Shepherd's Spring," Dick said,
  cheerfully. "And there is Molly in the doorway wondering what has become of
  me. Let us pay off our driver here and take her by surprise."</p>

  <p>Molly was peering anxiously into the darkness. She seemed to be utterly
  puzzled. Once in the light of the hall her face cleared.</p>

  <p>"Dick," she cried. "Dick, what does it mean? Little Mary Gay&mdash;I mean
  to say&mdash;Spencer. My dear, my dear, I am so glad to see you."</p>

  <p>The delight was genuine and spontaneous. Just for a moment, Dick longed to
  be a girl so that he might have taken Mary in his arms and kissed her. Here,
  too, was a new phase of the dream of happiness&mdash;Mary under his own roof
  and being fussed over and made much of by his own sister! Mary was moving
  about the house as if she had never known a deep affliction, her face was
  glowing with delight.</p>

  <p>"You are not to help me at all," she cried. "Positively, I decline to have
  any assistance. On the whole I am a great deal more at home here than you
  are. And what a dear, delightful old Molly it is! You are positively dying
  with curiosity to know how I got here, and not one question on the subject
  have you asked yet."</p>

  <p>"I shall take it out of Dick when you are in bed," Molly said. "For the
  present, I am only too delighted to see you near me once more. And if Dick is
  going to make a great name out of a romance he has all the materials at his
  fingers' ends here. What a charming heroine you will make to be sure,
  Mary."</p>

  <p>Dick blushed ingenuously. The colour was reflected in Mary's cheeks.</p>

  <p>"You mean Dick and myself," she said. "Dick is strong and tall, and good
  and true. But whoever heard of a blind princess?"</p>

  <p>Molly laughed as she kissed the pretty wistful face.</p>

  <p>"Dick is a very original genius, my dear," she said, demurely. "And I am
  sure that your affliction will lend a charm to the story."</p>

  <p>Dick effected to be suddenly busy and avoided Molly's mischievous glance.
  But he knew now that there would never be anyone else for him. It was an hour
  later before Molly came to him and aroused him from his dream.</p>

  <p>"Mary is tucked up in bed, fast asleep," she said. "Prince, prince, how
  did you come to fly away with your princess like this? Tell me at once or I
  shall expire from sheer curiosity. Go on at once."</p>

  <p>For the next hour Dick had an interested listener.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; HALCYON.</h2>

  <p>The cup of happiness seemed full, but there was room for more in the
  golden measure. It came the next morning in the form of a telegram from
  Spencer. He hinted vaguely that for the present the danger was averted, and
  congratulated Dick upon his brilliant success of the previous evening. He was
  to stay down at Stanmere for the present and see that nothing happened there.
  He was supposed to be away on business for the proprietor of the Record.</p>

  <p>"Something is going to happen to me presently," Dick said, with a
  delighted grin as he handed the telegram to Molly. "I am given a holiday, I
  have the most delightful weather, and the companionship of the most
  delightful girl in the world."</p>

  <p>"Two delightful girls," Molly said, severely. "My dear boy, you are in
  danger of forgetting your manners. But seriously, Dick, you will have to be
  careful. You have hit upon a most delightful and mysterious romance, you have
  found a charming heroine, but after all, Mr. Spencer is a man of business. If
  you had really given your heart to Mary&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The mischief is done," Dick said with a fine glow on his face. "I fell in
  love with Mary the first time I saw her. It was all done in a moment. When I
  came home that evening with those violets in my buttonhole, I had made my
  choice. Come what may, I shall never love another woman."</p>

  <p>"And when Mr. Spencer comes to know, as he must&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he shall be told. I am not going to sail under any false colours. But
  there is is plenty of time for that. Molly, doesn't it strike you that I am
  talking like a conceited ass all this time?"</p>

  <p>Molly laughed. Perhaps the conversation was a trifle premature. When Mary
  came down to breakfast, brother and sister were planning an excursion for the
  day. It was a sin to stay indoors such weather as this.</p>

  <p>"The watchword is the Warren," Molly said. "We shall take our luncheon
  with us; also out tea. If I could only find a spirit-kettle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In the store-room you will find everything, luncheon-basket included,"
  Mary interrupted. "I recollect those picnics in the old days. Let us go to
  the Warren by all means. Once put me down there and I shall know where I am.
  It is so good to feel that you are not utterly useless. In this house I can
  do everything for myself. Now, am I not very neat, seeing that my maid is not
  with me?"</p>

  <p>She looked very charming and simple in her white dress. She was facing
  towards the sun and speaking of certain points in the landscape here and
  there, when suddenly she paused.</p>

  <p>"There is somebody coming up to the house," she said. "I can hear a
  strange footstep. I hope it is nobody come to see you on business, Dick. I
  will go into the drawing-room and play till you have got rid of him."</p>

  <p>Dick could see nothing and hear nothing. Presently a step came outside,
  and the sound of a cheerful whistle, very much out of tune.</p>

  <p>"Greigstein!" Dick exclaimed, in great annoyance. "There seems to be no
  getting away from that ubiquitous German. Well, there is one thing pretty
  certain&mdash;he must be got rid of."</p>

  <p>Dick raised his voice angrily, and Molly lifted a hand of warning. It was
  too late. Through the open window Greigstein had heard everything.</p>

  <p>He stepped coolly through the long French window, still whistling his air
  out of tune.</p>

  <p>"I am not to be got rid of!" he said, coolly. "I am your Paul Pry, the
  limpet that clings to the affliction of my friends, Dick and Miss Molly.
  Behold I come down to see you; I say to myself they will be glad to see me,
  but now I am de trop. It is sad, but je suis, je reste."</p>

  <p>Dick laughed with the air of a man who grudgingly admits the humour of the
  situation. It was very difficult to be hard with Greigstein.</p>

  <p>"You have visitors," he said, wagging his head to the melody from the
  drawing-room; "stately visitors, who are far too good for humble tutors."</p>

  <p>"We are not snobs, whatever else we may be," Dick laughed. "On the whole,
  Molly, we had better make the best of a bad business and take Greigstein
  along. And if you see anything out of the common to-day, Greigstein, you are
  to be silent."</p>

  <p>"My tongue shall be dumb," Greigstein cried. "I swear to you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused and stood looking open-mouthed towards the doorway. Mary stood
  there smiling, and asking if she might be admitted. She came forward,
  Greigstein still standing there like a man who beholds some wonderful and
  unexpected vision. The next moment he had turned his face away, but not
  before he had caught the queer expression in Dick's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Our friend, Miss Mary Spencer," Dick said, with a certain solemn
  savageness. "This is Mr. or, rather, Herr Greigstein. Mary, Miss Spencer, is
  blind, Greigstein."</p>

  <p>Greigstein murmured something that it was hard to catch. His usual
  self-possession had absolutely deserted him. He looked like a man who was in
  a waking dream. Never before had Dick see him silent for so long.</p>

  <p>Long after they had started on their excursion, Greigstein had still
  remained in his dreamy condition. Dick watched him with the incident of the
  photograph still in his mind. Puzzled and bewildered as Greigstein evidently
  was, he was not more puzzled than Dick. The two men glanced at one another
  with a certain veiled antagonism. They were on the Warren now, with the fair
  stretch of the country at their feet. Molly was getting the luncheon ready,
  and Mary was rendering her some little service in so doing.</p>

  <p>"You have seen Miss Spencer before?" Dick asked.</p>

  <p>"There you are greatly mistaken," Greigstein said, presently. "We have
  never met before."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you will tell me that you have never heard of her?"</p>

  <p>"No. Because that would not be true. But I shall be discreet and silent as
  yourself, for I have need to be."</p>

  <p>Dick was silent for a moment. It had occurred to him that Greigstein was
  playing the spy in some way; he had come down with the idea that he might see
  Mary Spencer. But this view was not to be entertained seeing that the sight
  of Mary had filled Greigstein with such genuine amazement. There was no
  acting here.</p>

  <p>"You are an enigma to me," Dick said. "You are the hem of a secret that is
  concealed from me. But I have trusted you and been your friend. That you know
  something of this mystery I feel certain. And you play me false&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop," Greigstein cried. His face had grown stern and hard as Dick's.
  "You are going too far. I pledge you my word that I am acting for the best.
  Years ago I brought great sorrow on a noble house. I am one of those
  unfortunates who mean well. I have tried to atone for my error, and, between
  ourselves, my dear Dick, I have made matters worse. One word in your
  ear&mdash;keep Miss Mary out of Lady Stanmere's way."</p>

  <p>A moment later and Greigstein was laughing and talking gaily again. The
  stern, hard man had become a child once more, he was full of infinite
  resources and amazing stories. Mary sat on the grass, a happy smile on her
  lips. She looked upwards presently as a flashing white cloud trailed over the
  sun.</p>

  <p>"I hope it is not going to grow dull," she said. "I always feel the
  sunshine so."</p>

  <p>Greigstein turned from the luncheon basket that he was unpacking. He
  turned a keen glance on the speaker. Then he crossed over to her, and in a
  perfect semblance of the professional manner drew down one of her eyelids.
  Mary winced a little.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," Greigstein said. "What effect has that upon you?"</p>

  <p>"Most strange," Mary murmured. "I seemed to see something dim and rugged.
  A figure in a mist. But it was gone directly."</p>

  <p>Greigstein nodded. With his head on one side he regarded Mary as if she
  had been a new variety of butterfly. It was a long time before he spoke
  again.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; A RAY OF HOPE.</h2>

  <p>Greigstein had disappeared in his erratic fashion. In was nearly tea time
  when he came back with the casual information that he had been down to
  Stanmere to send a telegram, and that he had decided to accept Molly's
  invitation to stay the night.</p>

  <p>"Not that you have yet given me the invitation," he said, in the most
  inconsequent manner, "but it was sure to come. And when we get back to the
  house I propose to make an experiment or two on your eyes, Miss Mary. I know
  something about the science."</p>

  <p>Mary shook her head. She had seen more than one physician who had given
  her no hope. She had schooled herself to recognise the inevitable.</p>

  <p>"I had a long illness," she said, "and gradually my sight failed me. As I
  grew well and strong they hoped that my sight would return."</p>

  <p>Greigstein muttered something about paralysis of the optic nerve. It
  seemed hard to to look at those clear blue eyes and believe that they were
  sightless.</p>

  <p>"You speak like Von Wrangel," Dick said.</p>

  <p>"Ah, if he were only alive," Mary cried. "They say he was a perfect marvel
  as far as the sight was concerned. I was going to him when he disappeared. My
  father said he got mixed up in some mad Bohemian conspiracy, and had to fly
  for his life. He was shot by a spy. It was a sad ending for so brilliant and
  valuable a life."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever ever meet him?" Molly asked.</p>

  <p>Greigstein was lying on his hack with his face turned skywards.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I knew him very well," he said. "A clever man with a
  large amount of quicksilver in his veins. The desire to do something rash was
  his ruin. He never lost an opportunity of that kind. He would say to himself,
  'my friend here is a magnificent opportunity of making a fool of yourself.'
  And straightway he did it."</p>

  <p>"I believe you disliked him," Molly cried, "or you would not be so
  bitter."</p>

  <p>"I never met a man I liked more," Greigstein said, with a certain dryness.
  "Still, it may be that it was all for the best. For years I was that man's
  closest friend and his bitterest enemy. But, I may say without egotism, that
  he taught me as much about the human eye as he knew himself."</p>

  <p>Dick looked anxiously at the speaker. If he was going to try any
  experiment with those lovely blue eyes he would have to interfere. Sightless
  as those eyes were, their beauty remained. But already, in his mercurial way,
  Greigstein had changed the subject.</p>

  <p>Tea came presently, the long shadows were lying across the moorland, the
  last butterfly had fluttered into the bracken, and Molly reluctantly
  suggested a move.</p>

  <p>"A pity such a day should come to an end," she said.</p>

  <p>"But what a happy memory," Mary cried. "You and Dick have opened a new
  world to me. I used to think that I was perfectly happy in Cambria Square,
  with my flowers and piano, but it will never be quite the same again. Perhaps
  it is this lovely air that makes one feel so gay. Dick, please, give me your
  arm, I am delightfully tired."</p>

  <p>They were back at Shepherd's Spring at last. Greigstein nodded approval as
  he saw a neat-looking package in the hall. He could do nothing till the
  morning-room was chartered and half filled with queer-looking instruments and
  tubes of strange shapes. He was masterful and dictatorial at dinner. Once the
  meal was over he took Mary into the morning-room.</p>

  <p>"Now, I am going to make my experiments," he said. "Dick, I give you my
  word there is not going to be anything wrong. See here," He touched a kind of
  electric torch, and a crimson glow suffused the room, then another, then
  another, and there came a beautiful blend of glowing colors.</p>

  <p>"It is no longer dark," Mary cried. "The room feels as if it were flooded
  with moonlight. There is a suggestion of purple somewhere."</p>

  <p>Greigstein manipulated his lights, first in one hue and then in another.
  All the time the dominant note of color was purple. Whenever this came
  uppermost Mary seemed in some strange way to be aware of the fact. Greigstein
  tried again and again with similar result. He was quiet, almost saturnine,
  now, with a grim fighting look in his eyes. It was as if something had roused
  his anger. Outside the house he paced up and down long after Mary and her
  hostess had retired. Dick could hear the tramp of those footsteps and the
  muttered tones as Greigstein talked to himself. The versatile, volatile
  little butterfly hunter seemed to be entirely gone.</p>

  <p>He came back to the house presently, and began to smoke in silence.</p>

  <p>Gradually the dark mood turned from him and he began to smile once
  more.</p>

  <p>"Wrangel could cure that girl," he said, suddenly.</p>

  <p>"If he happened to be alive," Dick said, sententiously.</p>

  <p>"If he happened to be alive!&mdash;quite so. And I told you this
  afternoon, that he was not dead at all. Dick, do you recollect the meeting
  with Lady Stanmere in the summer-house?"</p>

  <p>Dick nodded. It was hopeless to try and follow Greigstein's mental
  wanderings.</p>

  <p>"Do you recollect what she called me?"</p>

  <p>"Let me see," Dick mused. "I recollect noticing that was not the same
  name. She called you Wrangel, Von Wrangel. Good heaven! Why, you
  are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Von Wrangel, only I am still to be known as Greigstein. Someday I will
  tell you how I came to get into this dreadful mess. But I am Von Wrangel, and
  Lady Stanmere is my aunt. And now you know why I sent that telegram, and why
  I made those experiments."</p>

  <p>Dick paced up and down in great agitation. He hardly dared to ask the
  question that was on the tip of his tongue.</p>

  <p>"And you think," he said, "you really think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Greigstein lighted a cigar coolly.</p>

  <p>"It is no matter for speculation at all," he said. "I deceive no patient,
  and I make no mistakes. Your beautiful sweetheart is going to see once
  more."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; ANXIOUS MOMENTS.</h2>

  <p>Kant stood watching the carriage drive down the square with the air of a
  man who has discharged his duty and has earned his realisation. He regarded
  the sky somewhat critically, and gave to the hall-keeper his studied opinion
  that there would be rain before long. At the same time he was looking keenly
  for the figure that he knew was concealed not far off. Presently a dark
  shadow stole out from under the shadow of the trees opposite, and Kant
  followed cautiously. He satisfied himself that at length the coast was
  clear.</p>

  <p>"A very near thing," he muttered. He wiped a gentle moisture his forehead.
  "I'm getting a bit too old to enjoy this business of sitting on a volcano.
  What a nerve that young gentleman has got, to be sure. You may say what you
  like, but education has its advantages. But sooner or later the whole truth
  must come out."</p>

  <p>It was some half an hour later before Spencer came home. He crept up the
  stairs like a man who is on the verge of paralysis. The grey pallor of his
  face, the blue tinge of his lips, startled Kant. He poured a little brandy
  into a glass and handed it to his master.</p>

  <p>"I dare not," Spencer groaned. "I am absolutely shattered, and the spirit
  would make a man of me, but I dare not. With nerves like mine, once I took to
  that kind of thing, I should be a lost man. Take the accursed stuff away, I
  tell you."</p>

  <p>Kant complied in his noiseless way. The flash of anger encouraged him.
  Spencer was not so far gone as his appearance denoted. Gradually the grey
  pallor left his face, the horrid twitching of his nostrils ceased. A gleam of
  interest came into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"That is a clever young man, Kant," he said, with a feeble smile. He
  rubbed his thin hands nervously together. "A very clever young man. I knew he
  would manage it."</p>

  <p>"Well, he did, sir," Kant said, respectfully. "Walked in here as if the
  place was his own and ordered me about in a manner
  that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I should never dare to imitate, Kant. Go on."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, we servants have our feelings the same as other people. I
  didn't know what to do. There he sat, smoking your cigars and grinning all
  over his face, ready to stay and wait for you till day-light if necessary.
  And Miss Mary playing the piano, a few feet away, all the time. I assure you,
  sir, a Turkish bath was nothing to it. Then that young gentleman came."</p>

  <p>Kant proceeded to go into details. Spencer smiled approvingly.</p>

  <p>"A very clever fellow," he said, "a very clever young fellow, indeed."</p>

  <p>"Ay, and an ambitious one, too," Kant said shrewdly. "A young gentleman
  who would hold himself to be as good as anybody. And if he happened to fall
  in love with the daughter of a millionaire its little he'd care for the
  millionaire if the young lady was willing."</p>

  <p>The faint suggestion of a smile faded from Spencer's face. Kant was a
  privileged servant and deep in his master's secrets. His speech was a gross
  impertinence, but Spencer failed to notice it. With his own selfish ends in
  view, he had never taken into consideration what might be the result of the
  romantic side of the adventure.</p>

  <p>"You are talking nonsense," he said, "and impudent nonsense at that. Mr.
  Stevenson is a gentleman, and is under certain obligations to me. Let me have
  a few months longer and my life's work will be done. Then nothing can make
  any difference. But if anything happened now, if the truth should come to
  light. . . . I dare not think of it. This is the shadow that follows me night
  and day, the haunting dread that never leaves me. And now there are two of
  them. . . . Heaven grant that I do not break down before my work is finished.
  Perhaps I have done wrong."</p>

  <p>"I am certain of it, sir," Kant replied. "Mr. Martlett."</p>

  <p>"But I sent for him. He was out of town. There was hardly time to think. I
  wanted somebody who was young and strong and full of resource, and young
  Stevenson suddenly occurred to me. And you can't deny that he saved the
  situation."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps to create another one, sir. And Stanmere of all places in the
  world!"</p>

  <p>Spencer made a feeble, impatient gesture. "I tell you fate was too strong
  for me," he cried. "It always is too strong for one who has committed such a
  crime as mine. To-day, rich and respected, working for the resurrection of a
  noble house&mdash;to-morrow, a criminal in the dock with all my plans ruined,
  with more misery on innocent heads than before. The thought haunts me night
  and day, it causes me to wake in the night and tremble. To conceal one crime,
  I have committed another. And yet it is for the best."</p>

  <p>"You would be best to go to bed," Kant said, practically.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are right. I feel so old to-night. I'll go to bed, Kant."</p>

  <p>Spencer dragged himself to his feet wearily, a human wreck, a dotard in
  the last stage of decay. He was like a child in the hands of his servant.
  Presently he closed his eyes wearily.</p>

  <p>"I shall sleep to-night," he said. "To-morrow I shall be myself again. Do
  not forget to send round for Mr. Martlett the first thing in the
  morning."</p>

  <p>Martlett came in due course, silent, self-contained, and rusty as ever. He
  found Spencer sitting at his breakfast, with little trace of last night's
  emotion upon him. He was calm and collected now, there was a touch of ruddy
  color in his cheeks. A calm presentment of a great philanthropist stood out
  before the lawyer. But the pupils of the eyes were dilated and the hands
  shook slightly.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter now?" Martlett asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>Spencer proceeded to explain. Martlett listened with absolute gravity.
  Whatever were the follies or the virtues of his clients, no gleam of his
  feelings was reflected on his parchment face. He listened to the very end
  without a sign.</p>

  <p>"Well," Spencer said impatiently. "What is your opinion?"</p>

  <p>"That Dick Stevenson is a very smart young man," Martlett said, drily.
  "Also that he has got you out of the frying-pan into the fire."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that I do not follow you."</p>

  <p>"Because you don't want to. To begin with, you have landed Miss
  Mary&mdash;the poor blind child round whom such tremendous interests
  revolve&mdash;at Stanmere. Lady Stanmere&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is the last person in the world who is likely to see Mary."</p>

  <p>"Because she never leaves the house, because she is wrapped up in her
  troubles? Pshaw! Now, let me tell you something. A little time ago, Dick
  Stevenson and his sister were living in Pant-street. There they made the
  acquaintance of an erratic German who, for political and other reasons, was
  masquerading as a teacher of languages. He called himself Greigstein. I knew
  all about it, because he is a client of mine. Being so friendly with the
  young people, what more natural than that he should visit them in the
  country?"</p>

  <p>"And see Mary, you mean. Why should he not? Stevenson is quite
  discreet."</p>

  <p>"It matters little how discreet he is. I told you that the German
  aforesaid called himself Greigstein. When I tell you his real name is Von
  Wrangel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A queer choked cry came from Spencer.</p>

  <p>"The last man in the world who ought to know," he said, hoarsely. "If he
  goes down to Stanmere he is certain to recognise the child. That reckless
  busy-body!"</p>

  <p>"He's got exactly that," Martlett interrupted. "Von Wrangel is a man with
  many noble qualities, but he is terribly indiscreet. All his lifetime he has
  been a man who has allowed his heart to rule his head. But we need not go
  into that. The point is that Von Wrangel is on the verge of discovering the
  secret."</p>

  <p>Spencer looked blankly at the speaker. "What is the best thing to be
  done?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The best thing under the circumstances is to leave matters to me,"
  Martlett said, drily. "I am as keen on seeing your plans through as you are
  yourself. And there is another point that you have lost sight of."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what it is, do not spare me anything."</p>

  <p>Martlett rubbed his hands together.</p>

  <p>"Von Wrangel is a brilliant surgical operator," he said. "But for his
  political indiscretions and his outspoken tongue, by this time he might have
  been at the top of his profession. People have short memories, but Von
  Wrangel's operations on people with defective sight, or no sight at all, are
  still talked of with bated breath in certain circles. And Von Wrangel is
  romantic. Here is a lovely girl, here is a chance to exercise his skill. One
  of those magnetic touches of his, the prick of a lance and Mary sees once
  more."</p>

  <p>Spencer made no reply for a moment. He stood staring at the speaker with
  dilated eyes. From deep red to pink, from pink to dull yellow and ashen grey
  his face gradually changed. His chest was heaving, and great drops stood on
  his forehead.</p>

  <p>"I believe you are a fiend," he said, in a voice so low that it hardly
  reached Martlett's ears. "You sit there with no heart or feeling or bowels of
  compassion, and torture me like this! I had never thought of that&mdash;the
  idea had never occurred to me. If such were the case, I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke down and wiped his wet face. Something had shaken him terribly.
  Absolutely unmoved, Martlett took a huge pinch of snuff.</p>

  <p>"I fancy I can understand," he said. "Very awkward position for you. But
  as to torturing you, that is also nonsense. It is my duty as your legal
  adviser to point out the risks you have to face. But if you are going to talk
  like a hysterical woman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no," Spencer said, hastily. "I feel like a man struck by lightning.
  Here is a new and horrible suggestion that takes the manhood out of me, here
  is another crime, Martlett. I am on the verge of the greatest crime of them
  all."</p>

  <p>Martlett rose and deposited his big snuff-box in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Wait," he said, "I may be wrong, of course. It does not follow that Von
  Wrangel may be in a position to&mdash;but I will see him, I will try and see
  him to-day."</p>

  <p>Martlett walked out with his hands behind him, inscrutable and mysterious
  as ever, his back slightly bent, as if the weight of the family secrets was a
  little too much for him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash; LAWYER AND CLIENT.</h2>

  <p>The weight of the family secrets had pressed Martlett down so close to his
  desk that he had not looked up from it for the last three hours. So absorbed
  was he in a mass of figures that he had quite forgotten that Greigstein,
  otherwise Von Wrangel, had telegraphed asking for an interview at four
  o'clock, which had made up for the disappointment of an unsuccessful search
  after the erratic German on the day before. The stuffy atmosphere of the room
  was rendered none the less so by the presence of an oil lamp on the lawyer's
  desk. Even the most brilliant summer light seemed to get discouraged and
  refused to show in these dingy chambers after mid-day.</p>

  <p>A clerk in rusty black stole in presently and laid a card on Martlett's
  table. He nodded gravely, and immediately Greigstein came in. He was in
  boisterous spirits and brought a refreshing atmosphere into that sad and
  stuffy room.</p>

  <p>"Ever busy, my old spider," he cried. "Ough, when I come in here I find it
  hard to breathe. Is air a crime? or is it a crime against the majesty of the
  law to open a window? If ever I want to kill any of my specimens instantly, I
  shall bring them here."</p>

  <p>"Sit, down, Von Wrangel," Martlett said, without a smile. "I tried to find
  you yesterday, therefore I was very pleased to get your telegram. Now, where
  were you yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"Where was I? Guess, old fox. Give one of your shrewd guesses."</p>

  <p>"I will. You were at Stanmere with my young friends, Dick and Molly
  Stevenson. You had a very pleasant day, and a tremendous surprise in the
  bargain. There you found the young lady whom we call Miss Mary, Lady
  Stanmere's missing relative. You have not met her before, but you recognised
  her from the amazing likeness to her mother."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel nodded. He was too astonished to say anything for the
  moment.</p>

  <p>"You are to keep your knowledge to yourself," Martlett went on. "For
  instance, you are not to say a single word of her presence to Lady
  Stanmere."</p>

  <p>"But the hint has already been given," Von Wrangel cried. "I got on the
  trail quite by accident. It was a photograph I saw at the lodgings of my
  young friend Dick. And when a further accident brought myself and Lady
  Stanmere together, I told her what I had seen."</p>

  <p>Martlett permitted himself to indulge in the luxury of a groan. It was not
  often that he gave way to human weaknesses of that kind.</p>

  <p>"I might have expected it," he said. "So, at the present moment Lady
  Stanmere is within a mile of our young friends the Stevensons, and knows that
  Dick can tell her what she requires."</p>

  <p>"But why not? The poor lady is longing for her relative. I had done the
  family so much harm that I longed to bring back a little sunshine into that
  lonely life. And Mary's father is as much in the dark as anybody else. I have
  proved that."</p>

  <p>Martlett's eyes twinkled for a moment. "We can leave him out," he said.
  "Mary's father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is one of the greatest rascals that pollute the face of the earth."</p>

  <p>"Well, we won't argue that either. My dear Von Wrangel, if I could invent
  some charge that would lead to your being locked up for, say, twelve months,
  I would do it with the greatest possible pleasure. You are always
  complicating things and getting in the way. You are brave and have tenacity,
  as that business at Potsdam proved. But you are terribly indiscreet; I never
  knew a brilliant man so indiscreet before. If Mary finds her way back to
  Stanmere at this moment it will mean ruin to Stanmere and disgrace to the
  lady who rules it. To prevent it I would sacrifice my fortune, my
  practice&mdash;ay, I would mortgage my good name."</p>

  <p>Two points of flame flashed from Martlett's eyes. His voice was raised, he
  crashed his fist down upon the table in a sudden spurt of fashion.</p>

  <p>"I have put my foot in it again?" Von Wrangel asked, "and with the best
  intentions. That dear lady's eyes were so sad, I thought of the poor girl's
  mother."</p>

  <p>"Whom you knew very well at one time?"</p>

  <p>"Whom I loved," Von Wrangel said, with great intensity, "who was taken
  from me by a knave and a scoundrel by lies and fraud. If it was not for the
  girl&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But it is for her. To a certain extent I have taken you into my
  confidence, but I dare not go further, because an impulsive man like you is
  not to be trusted. Now listen to me. You want money?"</p>

  <p>"I do. My telegram asked you to find me five hundred pounds at once."</p>

  <p>"You shall have it. Mind you, I am not fool enough to try and bribe a man
  of your integrity. But you shall have it on one condition. In the first
  place, you are to do nothing, you are not to interfere in the matter in any
  shape or form."</p>

  <p>"I promise that. It seems to me that I have done mischief enough."</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay," Martlett said grimly. "If you only knew how much mischief, you
  would attach yourself to a sheet of cork as a specimen&mdash;of the biggest
  ass in Europe. But there is another thing. You are intimately acquainted with
  Stephen Stanmere Gay."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel nodded. There was a murderous gleam in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see," Martlett went on. "We will not dwell upon that tender point.
  What I want to ask you is this: if we want to rid England of Master Richard's
  presence suddenly, can you show us any way of bringing that desirable
  consummation about?"</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel laughed unpleasantly. His eyes gleamed again.</p>

  <p>"You have come to the right place now," he said. "When the time comes you
  send to me the one word 'act' in the form of a telegram, and an hour or two
  later Richard Gay shall be flying, fearful of his life. I would hunt him from
  continent to continent like a mad dog. I would strike him down and rid the
  world of one of the worst."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel paused, and laughed with marvellously sudden change of
  manner.</p>

  <p>"But enough of that, old fox," he cried, "You leave it to me. And now tell
  me, can I have that five hundred pounds that we were talking about this
  week!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Martlett said thoughtfully. "Come to me on Saturday."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; LOST.</h2>

  <p>Like a wet sponge passed over a slate, all Dick's suspicions of Von
  Wrangel fell away. The mystery of the disguises and the sudden transformation
  to the brilliant polished man of the world were explained. Dick could smile
  at his own fears. It was flattering also to feel that he had made a friend of
  a man of such wide attainments. Von Wrangel read him like an open book.</p>

  <p>"Now you will not mistrust me any longer," he said. "For the present I am
  a refugee, but the time is coming when I can take my place again.
  Deliberately I sacrificed my position to save a worthless rascal for the sake
  of his wife and family. But apart from that the fact remains that I am Von
  Wrangel, the greatest eye operator in the world."</p>

  <p>He spoke so simply that there was no suggestion of egotism about him. In a
  drifting whirl of cigarette smoke he paced restlessly up and down the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Look you," he went on, "there is a secret about that young lady, the
  whole of which even you don't know."</p>

  <p>"But on which you might enlighten us," Dick suggested.</p>

  <p>"To a certain extent, yes; we might help one another. But we won't do
  that, because we are both pledged to secrecy and are both gentlemen. Besides,
  there is a story that I tell to no one. It is only on the professional side
  that I look now. Mind you, much or little as I know, I have never met Miss
  Mary face to face before. Directly I looked into those beautiful pathetic
  blue eyes of hers all my old instincts were aroused. They are lovely eyes,
  and there is nothing wrong with them&mdash;as eyes. I need not bore you with
  scientific phrases. I could see at a glance that the pupils were uninjured.
  But on the other hand the optic nerve might have perished. If that had taken
  place no surgery in the world could cure her, though certain experiments with
  the filaments&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel trailed off for an instant into details which Dick could not
  follow. The great scientist had fallen into a brown study and was talking to
  himself. The blue cigarette smoke was still like a cloud about his head.</p>

  <p>"But I am forgetting myself," he went on presently. "If the optic nerve
  was not destroyed, there was hope. You recollect the cause of the mischief
  was a long illness. Miss Mary is well and strong again once more, and
  consequently&mdash;But I am wandering again. A remark or two made to-day
  caused me to try certain experiments. They were quite successful. I want
  certain instruments and one or two exceedingly expensive drugs before I begin
  the operation in earnest; and you and I are going to town to-morrow and
  procure them. My lawyer shall find the money, and then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And then you are really hopeful?" Dick cried.</p>

  <p>"It is no question of hope at all," Von Wrangel said, coolly. "In a week
  those beautiful eyes will see as well as yours or mine. But you are to say
  nothing about it. If anything went wrong, the disappointment would be too
  keen. But I shall not fail."</p>

  <p>Dick gazed at the speaker with frank admiration. He made no boast; he did
  not raise his voice; he spoke as a man who knows his power and the way to use
  it. And whilst he slept peacefully, he gave Dick a restless and uneasy night.
  The whole thing seemed too good to be true. It seemed to Dick that this was
  the one thing wanting to make his happiness complete.</p>

  <p>He must tell somebody; it was impossible to keep so beautiful a secret to
  himself. When at breakfast time Von Wrangel alluded casually to a visit to
  London with Dick, Molly jumped, woman like, to the conclusion that it had
  something to do with Mary's eyes.</p>

  <p>"And I believe you know all about it," she said to Dick as she drew him
  into the garden. "I believe that you have some good news, and that we are
  entertaining Von Wrangel in disguise."</p>

  <p>"You'll guess a long time before you beat that," Dick cried. "My dear old
  girl, it is the most wonderful thing. Mary's sight is going to be restored,
  and I am off to London to get the necessary mysteries. Only, Mary is not to
  know. For the present, at any rate, Greigstein is Greigstein. He has no doubt
  whatever as to the success of the operation."</p>

  <p>Molly listened in tearful delight. It was like a story from a fairy book.
  And there was just the fear that the operation might end in failure.</p>

  <p>"It will be a fearful day for me," Molly gasped. "I am such a poor
  diplomatist. I shall have to stuff my handkerchief in my mouth for fear lest
  I should betray the secret. Think of the happiness before the poor
  child&mdash;think of the delight of her father. And to fancy that we have
  under our roof so distinguished a scientist as Von Wrangel!"</p>

  <p>"And to think of the cheap way we occasionally treated him," said Dick,
  with a suggestion of colour in his cheeks. "Molly, don't you feel ashamed of
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>It was late in the evening before Von Wrangel and Dick returned to
  Stanmere. The former hugged under his arm a precious parcel that he refused
  to confide to anybody. Contrary to his usual custom, he was short and snappy
  in his manner, and grew even to moody silence. The case was on his mind now
  to the exclusion of anything else, and would be till the operation was over.
  An allusion to butterflies on Dick's part was met with a snarl of contempt
  for men who waste valuable time upon such frivolity.</p>

  <p>"There is Molly waiting at the gate," said Dick. "Why, what is the
  matter?"</p>

  <p>Molly was pale, there were dark rings under her eyes. She looked miserably
  wretched and anxious, and the dust on her shoes showed that she had tramped
  far.</p>

  <p>"It's Mary," she gasped. "She went out this afternoon. I had something to
  do. She said she could find her way anywhere, and so she seemed able to do.
  Her idea was to go on as far as the edge of the Warren and back. And
  she&mdash;she&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Has not come back at all?" Von Wrangel asked</p>

  <p>"I went to look for her," Molly said, briefly. "She has not been in the
  Warren because the gate was locked. I called and called to her, and for the
  last two hours I have looked everywhere. Dick, the mystery of it frightens
  me. If harm has come to her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Molly could say no more. The picture of the poor blind girl wandering
  alone overcame her. Dick turned away with a groan of despair. Then he turned
  across the fields on a search that he knew in his heart of hearts was bound
  to end in failure.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; MARY TAKES A WALK.</h2>

  <p>A brilliant sunshine lay over Stanmere, there were purple shadows on the
  woods behind. Mary stood there with the golden light on her face picturing
  the different points of the landscape, a series of views from memory. There
  was something pretty and tender about it, a touch of pathos, no less touching
  because there was no shadow of sadness about it.</p>

  <p>"I can see it perfectly," she said. "The old beeches by the church porch
  and the golden cornland beyond. We must go there after we have had
  lunch."</p>

  <p>But Molly had to decline regretfully. At any rate, she could not go out
  till after tea. Really, there was so much to do. But there was no reason why
  Mary should not walk up and down outside. She professed to know every inch of
  the ground, and, indeed, she moved from place to place with a certainty that
  relieved Molly's mind from anxiety.</p>

  <p>"I am going as far as the edge of the Warren," Mary cried. "You need not
  have the smallest anxiety about me, Molly. Do let me go."</p>

  <p>Molly had no objection to make. And really she was very busy. There was a
  great deal of unpacking that she wanted to have off her mind. And then there
  was another thing, the secret of the forthcoming operation. Every time she
  glanced at Mary and saw the pathetic patience of those blue eyes she felt a
  wild desire to speak. She felt that she really must tell Mary the good news.
  It seemed cruel to conceal it from her.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said cheerfully. "If you get into trouble call for me.
  But I am sure that you will be able to manage it all right."</p>

  <p>Mary went off slowly down the path and into the road. There was no road in
  the proper sense of the word, but a broad grass track that led to the Warren
  on the one side and the broad expanse of the heath on the other. It seemed
  easy in the daytime, but many a faltering footstep had found disaster there
  on a dark winter's night.</p>

  <p>But it was soft and elastic now and downhill. Mary wandered on filled with
  the sense of the delight of her new-found freedom. The feeling of
  helplessness had left her. She touched a bush here and there to satisfy
  herself where she was, heedless of the fact that the shadows of the early
  September evening were creeping in. Her knowledge of the locality was all
  right, only her sense of time was at fault. It was getting a little late,
  Mary thought. The sun must have gone how, for the dim glow was no longer on
  her face. Perhaps she had better turn back. She must have been out for over
  an hour and she was getting a little tired. It would be as well to turn
  back.</p>

  <p>Mary did so, utterly ignorant of the fact that it was nearly dark.
  Somebody rustled up to her side and a hand was slipped into her own. Mary
  smiled as she felt the hand to be that of a child.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I'm lost," a fearless voice said. "We are staying at Brattle,
  and I came so far to look for white heather. I've got the heather, but which
  is the way home?"</p>

  <p>It was a well-bred and nurtured little girl, as Mary could tell from her
  voice and the smoothness of her hand. Blind as she was, Mary could be useful
  here.</p>

  <p>"We ought to be close to a clump of Scotch firs," she said. "Over to the
  left are they? My&mdash;my sight is not very good, so you must lead me there.
  From the firs the path is quite straight down to the church. Would you know
  your way then?"</p>

  <p>The child was certain of it. She gave a little cry of delight when the
  firs were reached.</p>

  <p>"How silly of me," she cried. "Why I could see my way before, only I got
  confused. I expect they will be rather anxious about me at home.
  Good-by."</p>

  <p>The child skipped away. Mary smiled a little proudly to think how useful
  she had been, and then the smile faded as she had lost her track.</p>

  <p>She would not cry out, she would try and find it. . . Surely it was
  getting very dark. And that path must lead to the house. Very few people came
  this way after dark, and perhaps&mdash;But somebody was coming. To Mary's
  quick ear it sounded like the step of a man. It was a swaggering step in a
  light boot; presumedly the passer-by was a gentleman.</p>

  <p>"Can you put me on the upland path that leads to Shepherd's Spring?" Mary
  asked, with some little hesitation. "Or if you could tell me where I am
  now?"</p>

  <p>"Under High Beeches, and going the wrong way," the stranger said. "Why,
  great heavens!"</p>

  <p>The speaker paused, the artificial politeness of his tones changed to a
  slight Cockney accent. The man in the loud tweed suit stared with amazement
  into Mary's face. There was something about the last few words of his speech
  that struck the girl as familiar.</p>

  <p>"I know you," she cried, "where have I heard you before? Oh, I know. You
  are Venner, the husband of my dear nurse Cecilia. What are you doing
  here?"</p>

  <p>Venner muttered something&mdash;he was utterly taken by surprise. The
  uneasy swagger had gone, the exaggerated loudness of his grey suit had a
  touch of humor about it.</p>

  <p>"Cecilia is here, and you have come to see her," Mary went on. "You have
  come to persecute her and worry her for money, as usual. I shall not permit
  it, Venner."</p>

  <p>An uneasy grin came over Venner's face. Of course Mary was staying at
  Stanmere. There might be something to be made out of this discovery later on.
  It never occurred to the man that Mary might have been staying somewhere else
  and had lost her way.</p>

  <p>"My wife came down here at Lady Stanmere's request," he said, with the
  uneasy grin still on his face. "I wanted to see her over some
  misunderstanding about a watch. You see, the watch was missing from her
  rooms; in fact, I took it by mistake. Being temporarily short of money, I
  disposed of the watch. It was unfortunate that my wife put the matter in the
  hands of the police. You quite understand, Miss Mary. If you could put in a
  good word for me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mary understood enough. The rascal had stolen the watch and pawned it.
  Mary knew where she was now. She could catch the scent of the sweetbriar
  hedge that bordered the Stanmere grounds. She would go on till she came to
  the lodge and get someone to send for Nurse Cecilia and warn her. She turned
  and left Venner grinning uneasily behind her.</p>

  <p>Cecilia must be warned of what had happened; she must let this fellow have
  his deserts. Probably Venner had stolen into her London rooms and carried off
  the watch, and Cecilia had informed the police without really knowing who the
  thief was. As a matter of fact, such was exactly the case. And Mary was quite
  alive to the character possessed by Horace Venner. Years ago before he
  married Cecilia, he had been a servant in the Stanmere household.</p>

  <p>Yes, this must be the way. But really the sweetbriar hedge was longer than
  it used to be. It seemed to lead now right on to the lawn. Groping about with
  her hands Mary came in contact with a stone figure that seemed familiar to
  her. Unless she was greatly mistaken there should be a sweep of gravel path
  close here. Before the thought was framed Mary's feet pressed it.</p>

  <p>She knew where she was now, close under the dining-room window at
  Stanmere. The poor girl was trembling from head to foot with fatigue and
  excitement. She had done a foolish thing, she might so easily have got Molly
  to send a few words of warning to Cecilia. But then Cecilia was in mortal
  fear of her husband.</p>

  <p>But Mary must not enter Stanmere. She had never inquired the reason why
  she had been so mysteriously taken away from there, but her father had willed
  it, and everything that he did was was right in her eyes. She must try and
  find her way back to Shepherd's Spring.</p>

  <p>Voices! Somebody was speaking somewhere, surely in the dining-room, the
  window of which must have been open. Mary listened eagerly, her heart beating
  fast with delight. For assuredly it was Cecilia who was talking. Cecilia
  would keep her secret and see her home. The truth about Venner could be told
  at the same time. Mary flung prudence to winds. She crept up to the window,
  which was wide open, and passed in without the slightest hesitation. She
  would see Cecilia and then&mdash;</p>

  <p>And then there was a wild glad cry, a pair of arms were wound round Mary's
  neck, and a voice which was not Cecilia's was pouring endearment in her own
  ear, and Mary realised in a tired, misty fashion, that she was in the close
  embrace of Lady Stanmere.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28"></a>XXVIII. &mdash; LADY STANMERE SEES A GHOST.</h2>

  <p>The beautiful decorous life was moving on slowly at Stanmere. There were
  no signs of poverty or anxiety there now; the trim lawns and flowers, the
  perfectly appointed gardens spoke of wealth. To the outsider with a sense of
  order and beauty it seemed impossible for trouble to touch Stanmere. Even the
  sleek servants seemed to be beyond the laws of sorrow.</p>

  <p>But to the mistress of it all life was dull and monotonous. Like Lady
  Deadlock, life had no charm for her. Unlike Lady Dedlock, she loved her home
  and was never bored there. But it was a house of shadows all the same, a
  houseful of painful associations. It was here in this room that Stephen had
  defied his father, and by that door that he had quitted the house for ever,
  by the passage that Lord Stanmere had gone to his death. There was much to
  care for but nothing to love.</p>

  <p>"If only Mary were back again," was the constant prayer going up from Lady
  Stanmere's heart. The girl had come into her life at the time when she sorely
  needed something to care for, and she had given the full wealth of her
  affection in return. And so suddenly Mary had been spirited away. Lady
  Stanmere had asked no questions, for there was nobody to answer them. The
  girl's father had taken her away and there was an end of the matter. The
  father might be dead by this time for all that Lady Stanmere knew to the
  contrary; but in any case the cloud was still over her life.</p>

  <p>Mary had gone for ever; Lady Stanmere had made up her mind to that. And
  then Von Wrangel had come back with the news of the child. She could not be
  dead, because she had so recently been photographed; there was no question of
  her identity, because Von Wrangel had known and loved her mother&mdash;the
  mother that Lady Stanmere had never seen.</p>

  <p>And here the child was&mdash;in some way connected with Richard and Molly
  Stevenson, the children of the late rector of Stanmere. It was very strange.
  And it was stranger still that Mr. Martlett had actually forbidden Lady
  Stanmere to follow up the clue, hinting at all kinds of evil consequences if
  Mary came under that roof again.</p>

  <p>But she must find out something, if only to satisfy her curiosity. Mary
  might be close at hand for all she knew to the contrary. Lady Stanmere was
  thinking it all over as her maid was dressing for dinner. The weary process
  was finished at length, and Lady Stanmere was alone in the vast solitude of
  the drawing-room. The windows were open to the lawn; through one of them came
  presently a tall, dark-eyed woman in a nurse's dress.</p>

  <p>"Cecilia!" Lady Stanmere cried. "What are you doing here!"</p>

  <p>The woman stooped and raised one of the long slim hands to her lips. She
  sank into the chair with the air of one who has come at length to a haven of
  peace.</p>

  <p>"I could not help it, my lady," she said. "You told me that whenever I
  wanted peace and rest I was to come down here. In the old days&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For the sake of the old days you are always welcome, Cecilia."</p>

  <p>The dark eyes in the pale face filled with tears. Nurse Cecilia looked
  like a woman with a history. It was the class of face which is softened and
  beautified by sorrow.</p>

  <p>"You are very good, my lady," she said. "My husband is about again. And he
  is seeking to make money out of some family secret. I can't quite guess what
  it is, but it has something to do with one of the&mdash;your sons. And he
  persecutes me; he declares that I shall come and live with him again."</p>

  <p>"Always trouble here," Lady Stanmere said, sorrowfully. "It was a bad day
  for us when Venner came here; and his father was respectable, too! But he
  dare not follow you here."</p>

  <p>"My lady, he dare follow me anywhere. I was tired and worn out, and I fled
  here to escape him. He found his way into my rooms and took a presentation
  watch from there. And I told the police, never guessing for a moment who the
  thief must be. If the police take him now, he will be sent to prison once
  more."</p>

  <p>"Surely that would be better for all parties, Cecilia?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it would, my lady! If I hold my hand, he must be taken. But I cannot
  forget the old days; and if he sees me, I am certain to be weak&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And submit yourself to the old persecution. Cecilia, if that man comes
  here, I will tell the servants to flog him from the doorsteps. After all you
  have done for him, after the way he has lived on you, this kind of thing is
  intolerable. Keep out of his way, Cecilia, let the police do their work and
  get rid of him."</p>

  <p>Nurse Cecilia wiped the tears from her dark eyes. She had not forgotten
  the old days when that rascal had been a passable husband to her. It was not
  for long, but the memory still remained.</p>

  <p>"I ought to do it," she murmured; "for the sake of the family to whom I
  owe so much, I ought to do it. And there is more rascality afoot behind it.
  Venner has some hold on one of your boys, my lady; I don't know which, but I
  am certain it is one of them. If I do nothing now, much anxiety and misery
  may be spared. But if I see that man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I tell you, it shall not be," Lady Stanmere cried. "You shall not see
  that man. You shall stay here as long as you like, Cecilia, and welcome. I
  was sorry to lose you. Indeed, I never could understand why you went at
  all."</p>

  <p>"Pride," Cecilia murmured, "my pride drove me away. All the servants here
  knew my pitiful story from the time I came here as a child. But it is very
  good of you, my lady. I have had so much work and worry lately that I am
  quite broken down."</p>

  <p>She stopped, unable to proceed. Lady Stanmere regarded her pitifully.</p>

  <p>"Not another word," she said. "We will find you something to do. My silks
  are on the mantel-shelf in the dining-room&mdash;pray get them for me."</p>

  <p>The dining-room was empty save for an elderly footman who was placing
  flowers on the table. He stood regarding the intruder with surprise.</p>

  <p>"Well, well," he said, "and so you have come back again. You were foolish
  to leave. Put those few chrysanthemums right for me. What a rare hand at
  flowers you used to be! I've wasted a whole hour over those, and look at
  them."</p>

  <p>A few deft touches and the flowers were transformed. Ceclia's heart was in
  her work.</p>

  <p>"There!" she said, standing back to admire her handiwork, and heedless of
  the fact that the aged footman had left the room. "It only needed the dark
  ones to be pulled out a little, so that the white blossoms have full play. If
  I could do nothing else but this work&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused as a light footstep struck her ear. She turned to see Mary in
  her white dress standing by the window. A cry of surprise and delight escaped
  her for she had known and loved the girl for years; she was something more
  than a sacred memory.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mary!" she cried. "Miss Mary back again! Where did you come from?
  Where have you been? Oh, my dear, dear child! my sweet Miss Mary!"</p>

  <p>In the decorous quietness of the house the cry rang out loud and clear. It
  reached Lady Stanmere, dreaming of old times by the side of the logwood fire.
  It came to her in a confused kind of way as if Cecilia's troubles had touched
  her brain and that she had lost her reason for the moment. Then there came a
  light laugh, light as thistledown.</p>

  <p>The cry brought Lady Stanmere to her feet, her hands pressed to her heart.
  She knew that laugh at once; she had heard it a thousand times in her dreams.
  Was it possible that she, too, was suffering from some passing
  hallucination?</p>

  <p>But there was that little laugh again, followed by voices. Somebody else
  was talking besides Cecilia. With shaking limbs, Lady Stanmere crept out into
  the vast gallery hall and crossed over to the dining-room. The voices were
  still ringing in her ears.</p>

  <p>She looked in. There was Nurse Cecilia with her hands on the shoulders of
  a girl in white, a girl with a serenely beautiful face and a pair of large,
  pathetic, blue eyes. There could be no possible doubt&mdash;it was Mary in
  the flesh. She stood there smiling as if she had never been away from
  Stanmere at all.</p>

  <p>"Now I must go," she was saying. "It seems very hard, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No no!" Lady Stanmere cried, "you must never go any more. My child my
  child, what power was it that induced you to leave us at all?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29"></a>XXIX. &mdash; ANOTHER VISITOR.</h2>

  <p>It was a long time before Mary could speak. She had done a foolish thing
  on the impulse of the moment. From the instant that she recognised Venner's
  voice, her prudence had been cast to the winds. Perhaps the fact that she had
  lost herself had rendered her a trifle hysterical.</p>

  <p>But she had done wrong. She had no business to have troubled about Cecilia
  at all. And that man had made her a kind of tool on the chance of his not
  being able to obtain an interview with his wife. She had come to Stanmere
  knowing that her father would sternly disapprove; indeed, why had he taken
  her from Stanmere in that mysterious manner unless there had been grave
  reasons?</p>

  <p>And yet what could she do? Lady Stanmere's broken cry had gone to her
  heart. It told how terribly she had missed the girl to whom she had given her
  love. Nor was it the time for explanation. She would stay a little time,
  despite the fact that Molly would be terribly anxious, and then, aided by
  Cecilia, she would steal away again. She had never expected to be trapped
  like this.</p>

  <p>"You are going to stay here, now," Lady Stanmere murmured, with her arms
  about the girl's neck. "My dear child, I could never part with your again.
  Your father sent you back?"</p>

  <p>"No, no," Mary said, in deep distress. "Dearest, I have no business here
  at all. I am here quite by accident. A little later and I will explain to
  you. But I am so dreadfully tired and hungry. If you will let me go to my own
  room with Cecilia to look after me&mdash;"'</p>

  <p>"Oh! yes, yes. But you must not run away again. Your room is
  ready&mdash;it has always been kept ready for your return. There is a fire
  there at this moment, and all your toilette things are laid out. The dresses
  you left behind are in your wardrobe, for I knew you would return."</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere sat down on a big armchair and cried softly. Meanwhile Mary
  had hurried away. In her old room everything was ready and waiting. Cecilia
  closed the door.</p>

  <p>"Now what does it all mean, Miss Mary?" she asked, eagerly. "Why did you
  go away? And how did you come back in this strange fashion?"</p>

  <p>"But I have not come back at all," Mary explained, hurriedly. "I am here
  by the merest accident of chance. I lost my way near here and
  Venner&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Cecilia drew a deep breath. "And you recognised him?"</p>

  <p>"By his voice. He was down here looking for you. I guessed that, and he
  did not deny it. And then he told me a shameful story of a watch that he had
  stolen. On the impulse of the moment I came on here to find you. Cecilia, do
  you know anything of the mystery that surrounds me?"</p>

  <p>"I can give a pretty good guess," Cecilia said.</p>

  <p>"Well, I am to ask no questions. I leave it all to the wisdom of my
  father. When I went away from here I did so without demur, though it seemed
  cruel to my grandmother. Good as my father is, there is something that
  persecutes him and follows him from place to place. Can you guess what it
  is?"</p>

  <p>"Ay," Cecilia said, with her eyes glowing. "I can guess, but I dare not
  say."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am not going to ask you. The old persecution followed us a day or
  two ago, and I had to leave London. I left it late at night, and in a most
  mysterious fashion. Again I asked no questions. I am with friends now that I
  love, and I am happy, but I was not to come here. Cecilia, you must get me
  back to those friends again."</p>

  <p>Cecilia said nothing. Her eyes were gleaming wildly. She pressed her hand
  to her side as if there were some sharp physical pain there.</p>

  <p>"I am the most miserable woman in the world," she cried. "You are asking
  me to deceive my benefactor, and, for your sake and others, I must do so. But
  not yet, give me time. You will dine with Lady Stanmere, and we shall see
  what we can do afterwards. Your friends must wait."</p>

  <p>Mary gave in with a little sigh. Her adventures had dazed her a little,
  and she was very tired. Down below, dinner was served, and Lady Stanmere was
  waiting. Behind her chair was Goss, manfully struggling to preserve his air
  of indifference. The long elaborate meal proceeded almost in silence. Lady
  Stanmere was waiting for the time when she should be alone with Mary. She
  pushed her plate aside&mdash;her dinner was a mere matter of form.</p>

  <p>Goss moved about in his own silent steady way. The presence of royalty
  would have failed to hurry him a pace. For once the decorous stillness and
  methodical slowness of the service irritated Lady Stanmere. She longed to be
  alone with Mary. From without the silence was suddenly broken, there was a
  harsh commanding voice that caused Mary to start and her hands to tremble.
  Contrary to all decorum, a footman fetched Goss out. He came back presently
  with a pencilled card that he laid by the side of his mistress. His face was
  a little pale and even his equanimity was shaken.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stephen is down below," the message ran; "says he must see you."</p>

  <p>A queer strangled cry broke from Lady Stanmere. She hurried out at once,
  followed by Goss.</p>

  <p>"Go and ask Cecilia to come this way," she whispered. "At once, please.
  Where is my son, Goss? Did you say that he was in the library? Strange how
  deaf I seem to have grown suddenly. Goss, on no account is Mr. Stephen to
  come in here. If necessary, force must be used. I am old and feeble, but I am
  not going to be treated like this any longer. I am going to have an
  explanation."</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere went on her way towards the library, and Goss hurriedly
  departed to fetch Nurse Cecilia. His face was white now, and he seemed to
  have some difficulty in controlling his legs. He burst into the housekeeper's
  room where Cecilia was sewing.</p>

  <p>"The devil has come back," he said. "He is in the library with my lady.
  And you are to go to the dining-room at once. Heaven knows what it all
  means."</p>

  <p>Cecilia departed swiftly as a shadow. There was the noise of a hoarse
  blustering voice in the library. In the dining-room Mary sat pale and silent.
  Even there the hoarse voice carried.</p>

  <p>"Cecilia," Mary cried, as she recognised the footstep. "What has happened?
  Something has gone wrong; and I can hear my father's voice."</p>

  <p>"Surely not, my dear child."</p>

  <p>"But I tell you that I can. It is my father, only he is hoarse and angry.
  I never heard him like that before, Cecilia. I am going to find out what it
  is all about."</p>

  <p>Cecilia rose and locked the door. Her face was white, her eyes hard and
  stern.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30"></a>XXX. &mdash; THE PRODIGAL.</h2>

  <p>Just for one moment Lady Stanmere faltered. She stood in the great hall
  with the dead and gone Stanmeres looking down upon her, soldiers and
  statesmen and clerics that Lely and Van Dyck and Reynolds and Romney had
  painted. There had been terribly wild blood in many of them, but no disgrace.
  It would have been easier to have faced the shade of any of them there than
  meet the degenerate man now waiting in the library.</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere stood there with her hand pressed to her heart, and a
  dryness in her throat. At any cost this disgrace must be averted. Stephen Gay
  had left home with the shadow of crime upon him, and he had never been back
  till to-night. What his record had been in the meantime, Lady Stanmere did
  not dare to think.</p>

  <p>But he was her son; this wayward, handsome boy had sat at her knee and
  lover her in the golden days. It all passed before her eyes like a
  flash&mdash;the promising son, the small disgraces, and the gradual unfolding
  of those meaner qualities that the mother had in vain tried to hide from a
  stern father.</p>

  <p>Twenty years. Nearly 20 years since she had seen Stephen last. Perhaps if
  she had been a little more severe! A stern-faced bishop after Holbein frowned
  at her from his frame, and one of Lely's beauties simpered. What were vain
  regrets now? For Stephen was in the library, a desperate man, or he would not
  have been here at all. With all the courage that she could command Lady
  Stanmere walked into the library and closed the door. The room was
  brilliantly lighted, for Stanmere had its own electric supply. In a spirit of
  bravado Stephen had switched on all the lamps. He stood in the centre of the
  room&mdash;the very picture of a hunted animal brought to bay. Under ordinary
  circumstances his suit of Harris tweed would have spoken eloquently enough of
  hard wear, uncertain habitation, and dubious company; but now it was torn and
  soiled and stained as if he had come headlong across country with pursuit
  hard behind him.</p>

  <p>His eyes gleamed, too, his hair was matted and dishevelled. He was still
  breathing very hard as if he had run far and fast. The handsome face scowled
  and then the hard lips quivered. A long scratch down the right cheek, the
  result of a bramble, did not add to his appearance. He stood there hard and
  defiant, as if uncertain of his welcome.</p>

  <p>"Stephen," Lady Stanmere whispered. If the man had not been so utterly
  wrapped up in himself and his troubles he would have seen how pitifully the
  slim hands trembled. "Stephen!"</p>

  <p>He laughed recklessly. He looked round at the handsome appointments of the
  room, the thick Persian carpet, the deep leather chairs, at a reflection of
  himself in the carved Florentine mirror opposite. How different everything
  might have been.</p>

  <p>"Nothing changed," he said. "No alteration after twenty years. You wind
  the clock and the clock goes round, and there is an end of it. I might have
  been as respectably dull as Stanmere. I might have been sitting down in
  decent sables with Goss handing me my coffee. I should have ended by burning
  the old place down. And at&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off with a queer strangled sigh.</p>

  <p>"Stephen," Lady Stanmere said, "you are in trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I am. I was born to be a trouble to myself and everybody
  connected with me. My dear mother, I am flying from the police."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Stephen! My poor, headstrong boy."</p>

  <p>"There, there," the man said, not unkindly. "I was a bitter grief to you
  in the old days, but I have kept myself out of the way. For twenty years I
  have not worried you."</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere sat down and folded her hands. There was a gentle patience
  about her that was almost sublime.</p>

  <p>"There you are wrong, my boy," she said gently. "For twenty years, day and
  night, you have never once ceased to be a trouble to me, and till I go down
  to my grave you never will. It was here that your father and myself sat with
  yourself and Paul playing before the fire&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't, mother. I know what you are going to say. And here am I a nameless
  vagabond, and Paul, wherever he is, a smooth-faced ruffian far worse than I
  am. I have wronged many a man, but never one as Paul has wronged me. I have
  been hunting for him, and when we meet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Stephen Gay was talking to himself, he had entirely forgotten his
  surroundings. Lady Stanmere gave a little cry as she saw the expression of
  his face.</p>

  <p>"Look at yourself in the glass," she whispered. "What do you see there?
  The features of a murderer. And you are speaking of your own brother."</p>

  <p>Stephen laughed recklessly. The hard look faded from his eyes.</p>

  <p>"We need not go into that," he said. "And Paul is safe for the present.
  Mother, I am penniless. I want you to let me have some money to get away
  with. Money was scarce enough in the old days, but I hear that things are
  different now. What does it mean?"</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell," she said. "I have no head for business. I only know that
  after your father died the old money worries ceased. All the clamouring
  tradesmen were paid, and Stanmere is nearly free. Mr. Martlett has managed
  everything. If you want money you can have it&mdash;five hundred, a thousand,
  two thousand, if it will only save the disgrace."</p>

  <p>"No, no. I want less than that. Can you let me have a hundred pounds in
  gold? Give me that and I shall find a way out."</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere nodded. The money was in the house ready to clear the
  housekeeping books at the end of the week. His hard, scratched face softened
  as he heard. Perhaps there was feeling in him somewhere.</p>

  <p>"I swear to you that I would not have come could I have managed it
  otherwise," he said. "But for the first time in my life I am absolutely and
  entirely beaten. I have lived in mansions and in hovels, and I have been
  equally happy in both. For five years I was absolutely respectable and
  prosperous. But always with the fear of the past before my eyes. The vendetta
  never loses sight of me for long. Von Wrangel's sacrifice for me is
  vain."</p>

  <p>"Von Wrangel is the curse of the house," Lady Stanmere cried. "He is of my
  own flesh and blood, but I wish he had never been born. But for him
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Would always have been what I am. Make no mistake on that head, mother.
  If I had not gone in for the seamy side of foreign politics, I should have
  taken up something infinitely worse. I know that Von Wrangel dragged my
  father in, but he could not possibly foresee what was going to happen. Do you
  know why my poor father was found in the lake?"</p>

  <p>"An accident," Lady Stanmere faltered. "The jury said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The jury would say anything where a peer is concerned. My father
  committed suicide. You know that as well as I do. And why? Because he had
  discovered what I had done. There was a woman in the case; the poor creature
  who afterwards became my wife. It was not me she cared for, but Von Wrangel.
  And to part them I betrayed the Order to which we both belonged. There are
  many good lives being wasted in gaol to-day because of that dastardly act of
  mine. But those blue eyes drove me mad. I never stopped to think. And I
  betrayed the Order to the police."</p>

  <p>Gay paced up and down as he was speaking. There was no shame about him; he
  might have been a criminal telling his story after his capture, when all was
  lost.</p>

  <p>"Von Wrangel knew," he went on. "He did not kill me as he ought to have
  done, but, for the sake of the woman he loved, for your sake, mother, he made
  it appear as if the whole thing was one of the queer headlong blunders of his
  own. He lost his position, he had to disappear. Do you mean to say that he
  has never told you this?"</p>

  <p>"I am hearing it for the first time," Lady Stanmere said, wearily.</p>

  <p>"Ah, he is a noble fellow. I am not so bad that I cannot admire nobility
  in others. But unhappily for me, there were members of the league who got at
  the truth; ruined men all of them. For years they have been hunting me all
  over the world. If my life had been a valuable one it would have been
  forfeited long ago. Being a useless vagabond I have escaped&mdash;till last
  night. Then I had to fight for existence. And as to the man I had to fight, I
  can't say whether he is dead or not."</p>

  <p>"Stephen, you don't mean to say that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I do. I had to be the hammer or the anvil, and naturally I
  preferred to be the hammer. How close the police are on my track now I cannot
  say, but they were very close this morning. I had expended my last sixpence;
  I was close to Stanmere, I lay in a ditch for two hours debating whether I
  should come here or not. It was a hard struggle, but when a man is penniless
  and hopeless, his resolution is apt to fail him. And that is all."</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere listened dully. The horror of the thing froze her. She must
  wake up presently and find the whole thing an evil dream. The intrusion of
  vulgar crime amongst all these refined surroundings seemed impossible. It
  seemed almost impossible to believe that this hunted, dirty scoundrel, with
  the scar on his face still bleeding, could be her son, the handsome,
  headstrong boy who had played soldiers in that very room not so many years
  before.</p>

  <p>No, he must be some impostor who by chance had learnt by heart several
  dark pages from the family history. But, then, the voice was the voice of
  Jacob; a mother would not be deceived like that. And if Stephen Gay had not
  been so wrapped up in himself he would have noticed the change that a score
  of year's had produced.</p>

  <p>"I thought that the cup was full," she murmured. "I thought that the cup
  was full. But one never knows the measure of one's grief. You must stay here
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" Stephen cried. "I should not be safe. Give me the money and
  let me go, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused as the door opened and Goss looked in. This butler's face was
  perfectly grave and composed, but he could not repress the agitation in his
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Inspector Lawman to see you, my lady," he said. "He is in the
  morning-room."</p>

  <p>Goss bowed and closed the door gently behind him. Stephen Gay looked about
  him eagerly.</p>

  <p>"What did I tell you," he said hoarsely. "The hounds are nearer than I
  imagined. You must not see that man, mother; it would be fatal it you did. Is
  there anybody in the house you can trust, anybody who is familiar with our
  history?"</p>

  <p>"Nurse Cecilia, Venner's wife," Lady Stanmere cried, eagerly. "I am not
  well enough to see anybody, which, indeed, is no more than the truth. I will
  fetch her."</p>

  <p>Stephen Gay was alone for a moment. He looked round eagerly for some
  avenue of escape. He knew every trick and turn of the great house, though he
  had not seen the inside for a score of years. There was a doorway leading to
  an annexe terminating in a conservatory, which in its turn gave upon the
  smaller drawing-room. Once in the drawing-room it would be possible to dash
  across the terrace and so gain the haven of the wood. Beyond the wood was the
  manor and the moorside, where nobody could follow. There was a time when
  Stephen had known the secret paths by the bogs, but he had forgotten
  them.</p>

  <p>"I'll see how the land lies," he muttered. "They might have made some
  changes since my time. Just as well to be on the safe side."</p>

  <p>He crept cautiously into the annexe, and from thence into the
  drawing-room. It was soft with shaded lights and yet perfectly bright and
  clear. By the fireside sat Mary, in an altitude of rigid attention. She was
  quite alone, but she seemed to be listening to something. Stephen Gay
  staggered back with his hand to his head. He was like a man who has had a
  sudden shock. Then a hand came out from behind and dragged the dazed
  adventurer into the conservatory again. Mary half turned her head at the
  sound of the closing door.</p>

  <p>"Cecilia," Stephen cried. "Cecilia Venner! What does it all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush," Cecilia whispered. "Heavens, how near you were to spoiling
  everything. If you would not bring ruin upon us all, be silent."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31"></a>XXXI. &mdash; "IF I COULD ONLY SEE."</h2>

  <p>Mary stood there trembling from head to foot with excitement. It had been
  a trying day with her, and her nerves were strung to their highest pitch.</p>

  <p>"I am sure it was my father," she said. "He speaks now as if he were
  disturbed and angry, like he used to do years ago before the money came and
  we were prosperous. And there is something dreadfully wrong or he would never
  speak like that. I must go to him."</p>

  <p>"I hear nothing but confused sounds," Cecilia said.</p>

  <p>"That is because all your senses are alive," Mary replied. "What I lost in
  one way I gained in another. I cannot follow the words, but I am certain of
  my father's voice. Let me go to him."</p>

  <p>"No," Cecilia said quietly. The white, worn face was very hard now, the
  dark eyes firm. "You are to stay here. It will all be explained
  presently."</p>

  <p>"I must know now. I must, I tell you. You can't detain me by force."</p>

  <p>"I can and will, Miss Mary. A rash step now and you will regret it all
  your life."</p>

  <p>Mary yielded with a passionate sigh. The gentle nature could not combat
  firmness like this. And yet her heart was in wild revolt.</p>

  <p>"If I could only see," she cried. "If I could only see, I might understand
  things better. But I seem to move in a dark world that is full of mysteries.
  Nobody seems to have any confidence in me. I am like a child who has a sweet
  popped in its mouth to prevent it asking questions. I am taken here and there
  and never am I to ask questions. If anybody cared for me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, dearest, there are many who love you. My dear, if you only knew how
  precious your life is, what tremendous interests revolve around you! Blind as
  you are, your power is tremendous. And surely, surely you can trust in
  me!"</p>

  <p>"Can I trust in anybody?" Mary cried.</p>

  <p>"Hush! Not so loud. You are saying cruel things. If you will only be
  guided by me!"</p>

  <p>Mary's hands went out, feeling for those of her companion.</p>

  <p>"I did not wish to be unkind," she said. "But it is dreadful sitting out
  here in the dark with all these strange things going on about me. It is not
  as if I was of any importance."</p>

  <p>"But you are, dear," Cecilia said, gently. "You are of more importance
  than Stanmere itself. I am not supposed to know, but I found it all out long
  ago. And if you are indiscreet and let others find out, we shall all be
  ruined. Dear Miss Mary will you be guided by me?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Cecilia, I will do anything that you ask."</p>

  <p>"Then remain exactly where you are. Don't move till I come back. And if
  anybody comes into the room take no notice till you are spoken to."</p>

  <p>Mary promised, in her simple, childish way. It was some time before she
  heard a step, and then it seemed to be behind her. She heard something that
  sounded like a stifled cry, and then the banging of the conservatory door. If
  only she could have seen what was going on behind her!</p>

  <p>Stephen Gay stood amongst the flowers swaying to and fro like a drunken
  man. Nurse Cecilia seemed to have become transformed. The sad and weary look
  had left her face, she was alert and vigorous now. She turned defiantly to
  her companion.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "have you any questions to ask?"</p>

  <p>"A thousand," Stephen said hoarsely. "How did SHE get here?"</p>

  <p>"That for the present will remain a secret. The fact remains that she is
  here. And if you want to ruin everything, to bring the house down about our
  ears and drive your mother into a pauper's grave, then throw prudence to the
  winds and go and speak to her."</p>

  <p>"Mysterious and dramatic," Stephen sneered. "My brother&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your brother is a thousand times a better man than you. He never won a
  wife by a dastardly lie and broke her heart afterwards. But we need not go
  into that. Come this way. I am going to see Inspector Lawman and put him off
  the track. I doubt if he comes for you at all, but your conscience is uneasy.
  However, it is best to be on the safe side. Go up to your father's room. You
  used to be wonderfully alike as regards figure. Get into a suit of dress
  clothes; make a respectable appearance for yourself. Then come down again and
  wait for me here."</p>

  <p>"Always clever and full of resources," Stephen growled, admiringly. "So
  clever that I don't understand why you ever came to marry Venner."</p>

  <p>"Women are strange creatures," Cecilia said coldly. "It is not so
  remarkable when one considers that you found a woman to marry you."</p>

  <p>She walked off calm and neat across the hall. In the morning-room a
  slight, active-looking man was walking up and down the room impatiently.</p>

  <p>"You asked to see Lady Stanmere," she said, "but I fancy I am the right
  person. When I tell you that my name is Cecilia Venner&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," Lawman interrupted. "In a measure I am down here in connection
  with the watch that was stolen from your rooms in London. We have traced the
  watch to a certain pawnbroker, who is able to identify the man. I am sorry to
  say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You need not be in the least sorry. I am quite aware of what you are
  going to say. The thief you have in your mind is my husband. I might have
  known that before I placed the matter in the hands of Scotland Yard. Directly
  I did so I knew that I had done a foolish thing. If I could only go back
  now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that is impossible. Once a thing is in the hands of the
  police&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am quite aware of that. If you have made any arrest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not up to the present. But we have traced your&mdash;the thief down here.
  We are perfectly aware that he is somewhere in the house. We are very loth to
  disturb Lady Stanmere, but we have a certain duty to perform."</p>

  <p>"But there is no necessity to alarm the household," Cecilia cried eagerly.
  "If that man is here I shall find him. He shall be expelled from the place,
  and once outside your course is clear. And if you only knew what an effort it
  costs me to say so much&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Inspector Lawman was outside again a few minutes later with a clear idea
  of his plans and the assurance that he had enlisted a clever woman on his
  side. But the clever woman's face had grown grey and worn again, all the
  strength seemed to have gone out of her limbs.</p>

  <p>"Fortune favours me," she muttered, "but the price is heavy. So my husband
  is actually hiding in the house somewhere. I must betray him; it is a
  terrible thing to do, but my duty is clear. And there is no reason why Mr.
  Stephen should know that the police have not come for him&mdash;yet he must
  be got out of the house, too. If I had not come down here goodness only knows
  what might have happened. But, on the other hand, Miss Mary would not have
  entered Stanmere, so that my presence is as much a curse as a blessing."</p>

  <p>Cecilia stood in the corridor waiting patiently for Stephen Gay. He came
  at length, but so utterly transformed that it was almost impossible to
  believe that he was the same man. His ragged hair was shaved off, the dirty
  suit discarded. In his somewhat old-fashioned dress clothes and glossy linen
  he looked the presentment of a country gentleman, a little given to
  dissipation, perhaps, but quite to the manner born.</p>

  <p>"A sufficiently passable disguise," he said, with a sinister smile.</p>

  <p>"Admirable," Cecilia said. "I have got rid of the police for you&mdash;for
  the time being, never mind how. But you cannot stay here, Mr. Stephen.
  To-night, perhaps, it will be best for you to remain."</p>

  <p>"As if I did not know that as well as you do. But for the present I am
  quite easy in my mind. You ask who I am. I am not Stephen Gay at all. Oh, you
  need not look at me in that curious way. I know a great deal more than you
  imagine."</p>

  <p>Cecilia muttered something as if she had a difficulty in swallowing.</p>

  <p>"You will do nothing," she said, presently, "you will ask no questions. As
  sure as you do, I will betray you. You have not been in the
  drawing-room?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I haven't."</p>

  <p>"Nor are you to go there. Lady Stanmere has gone to her room. Oh! why did
  you come here at all, why did you not leave us alone as we were before you
  came?"</p>

  <p>Gay laughed. There was a certain enjoyment in his reckless adventure. He
  was his own self again now.</p>

  <p>"Have no fear," he said. "I have passed my word, and there is a look in
  your eyes that tells of a pretty temper when you are aroused. Ask Goss to see
  that there is a bed for me, and some whisky and cigars in the library. I'll
  be lord of acres for a few hours to-night."</p>

  <p>The house grew quieter. Most of the lights had been out for some time, but
  still Stephen Gay sat there with a cigar in his mouth. Despite the
  respectability of his appearance, there was an expression on his face that
  was not good to see. He bit his cigar nervously; he had a curious, hunted
  expression in his eyes, like a dog that is always alert.</p>

  <p>"Strange," he muttered, "I heard a sound somewhere. If those fellows
  think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The cautious step came nearer. Gay rose softly and switched off the light.
  A moment later and he pounced down upon something distinctly warm and human.
  The struggle was a short one, for the stranger made no fight at all. The
  sudden rush of light again dazzled his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Venner," Gay said coolly. "Toujours Venner. As to your motives here there
  can be no two opinions. If things were not as they are I should hand you over
  to the police. For the sake of your wife I am going to quietly put you off
  the premises."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know," Venner gasped. "I didn't expect. But don't put me out
  to-night, sir. Let me stay here till it gets light and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did you hear me speak? If you don't go I'll throw you out of the
  window."</p>

  <p>Venner fell back as the other rose. There was an ugly look in his eyes.
  The front door closed behind him, there was a rattle of bolts and bars. On
  his hands and knees Venner crawled away as if fearful of every shadow. He
  paused for breath behind a bush at length. He shook his fist savagely at the
  house.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he muttered. "If it is to be me, it shall be you as well. If
  they take me they shall take you as well, you murderous spy. What's
  that?"</p>

  <p>A light flashed out, holding the bush in the centre of a ring of dazzling
  flame.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32"></a>XXXII. &mdash; A WHITED SEPULCHRE.</h2>

  <p>Dick caught the full significance of Molly's speech after a moment. A
  stinging reproach rose to his lips, but the whiteness and misery of Molly's
  face restrained him. Under ordinary circumstances there would have been no
  occasion for anxiety, but with the halo of romance that surrounded blind Mary
  from the first, Dick saw the shadow of crime here.</p>

  <p>"How did it happen?" he asked as gently as possible.</p>

  <p>"It all seemed so natural," Molly explained. "I was too busy this
  afternoon to go out. And really, I wanted to be alone, because I could hardly
  trust myself to keep the good news from Mary. She said she could walk as far
  as the Warren."</p>

  <p>"Go down to the Warren alone!"</p>

  <p>"Why not, Dick. She knew the way quite well. I watched her going down the
  path as steadily as I could have walked myself. Not very fast, perhaps, but
  she never seemed to hesitate. When tea-time came and she did not
  return&mdash;but I need not go into that. I have looked everywhere."</p>

  <p>After all, there was little more to be said. Mary had utterly disappeared,
  leaving no trace behind her; it was not possible to believe that she had
  deliberately run away from her new friends. The trio by the garden gate
  looked furtively at each other, neither of them daring to suggest foul
  play.</p>

  <p>"It would be as well, perhaps, to go into the matter," Von Wrangel said,
  "if I only knew the circumstances under which the young lady came
  here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That is impossible," Dick said curtly. "It would be a betrayal of
  confidence."</p>

  <p>"And I quite agree with what Dick says," Molly murmured.</p>

  <p>"In that case your duty is plain, Dick," Wrangel went on. "The young lady
  has disappeared. She seems to be the central figure in a strange mystery; she
  comes down here to be out of the way of somebody, and it is fair to assume
  that somebody has found her. We cannot find that somebody till we know who he
  or she is. The young lady's guardian is most likely to know. Dick, you must
  go and see him at once and tell him what has happened."</p>

  <p>Dick nodded gloomily. Obviously Mr. Spencer must know of this disaster
  without delay. If some enemy had spirited Mary away, Spencer would be most
  likely to know who that enemy was.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather cut my right hand off," Dick said. "After all his kindness and
  goodness and the implicit way he trusted me, it seems dreadful to fail like
  this. Oh, I'll go, Molly. Perhaps our kind friend here may solve the
  problem."</p>

  <p>Dick strode off down the road without another word. He would be in London
  again and at Cambria square a little after ten o'clock. The whole thing had
  been a terrible blow to him, the sudden change of circumstances had shaken
  even his steady nerves. Half an hour before he had covered the ground with a
  cheerful heart and the fairest dreams of the future.</p>

  <p>There was London and the fierce lights of the electrics. As Dick neared
  his destination he found his heart beating faster and a certain dryness in
  the back of his throat. He would try the Record office first; possibly Mr.
  Spencer was there.</p>

  <p>Yes, the proprietor of the paper was in his office alone. Dick wished
  guiltily that he had been at home, anywhere so that the evil hour might be
  postponed. Mr. Spencer was stooping over a pile of accounts as Dick entered.
  The kindly smile on that pleasant face vanished as he caught the haunting
  misery in the eyes of the young man.</p>

  <p>"Shut the door," he said sternly. "Now tell me what has
  happened&mdash;quick."</p>

  <p>There was command in his voice but fear in his eyes. He passed his hand
  across his forehead in a confused kind of way.</p>

  <p>"It is Mary," Dick stammered. "She went for a little walk this afternoon
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You mean that she went out alone?"</p>

  <p>Dick explained. Mr. Spencer's head was turned away, his eyes shaded by his
  hand. For a little time he sat there quite still. Dick stood by
  miserably.</p>

  <p>"If you only knew," he said; "if you could only tell how I&mdash;Give me
  another chance, sir. Really, I am not thinking about myself. It seems so
  cruelly hard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is cruelly hard, Dick. My dear boy, I am not going to blame you at
  all. I ought never to have sent Mary down there, the risk was too great. And
  yet I believe it is an axiom that the safest place to hide is where one is
  least liable to be looked for. You acted with such fertility of resource the
  other night that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But Miss Mary must be found, sir," Dick urged. "Somebody must have
  spirited her away, and it seemed to me that you would be most likely to know,
  if not where she is, at least who is responsible for this outrage. If you
  will only tell me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My boy, I know exactly where Mary is. She is at Stanmere."</p>

  <p>Dick regarded the speaker with astonishment. Was he suffering now from one
  of his lapses of memory? But he spoke so calmly and deliberately that that
  was out of the question. He could not have been more assured if he had taken
  Mary to Stanmere himself.</p>

  <p>"Then you are quite easy in your mind, sir?" Dick asked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Spencer laughed drearily. Then his mood changed, and he paced up and
  down with great agitation.</p>

  <p>"I have not been easy in my mind for years," he cried. "I shall never be
  again. Long ago I committed a great crime. I had been reckless and wild in my
  youth, but I had done nothing that had disbanded me from the company of
  honest men. Then I fell. It was bad enough to have that crime on my mind, it
  was worse to be followed by a shadow that never left me. There was a
  scoundrel whose silence I had to buy. For years I bought it hard. Then I got
  rid of my incubus, and I began to grow rich. I set myself to do a certain
  thing, and I am within reach of attaining it. I became wealthy, respected; I
  almost forgot my shadow."</p>

  <p>Spencer paused and wiped the moisture from his face.</p>

  <p>"One day the shadow returned. It came at a time when it was vital that I
  should be free. There was a crisis in my affairs. I went to one of the
  cleverest men in England and told him how I stood. And he showed me a way out
  of the difficulty. It was so clever and daring and ingenius that I was almost
  afraid. There was an element of cruelty and deception about the plan, but I
  was desperate. I put it into execution, and it fell out with the greatest
  ease. I rid myself of my shadow, and the scheme of my life blossomed like a
  rose again."</p>

  <p>"If it distresses you," Dick said, as Spencer paused, "I hope you
  won't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It does not distress me at all; on the contrary, it does me good to open
  my heart to somebody. I got rid of my shadow, but that bold deceit of mine
  gave me another enemy. I have successfully evaded him for a long time, but I
  fear he has the best of me at last. If he has done so and Mary is at
  Stanmere, as I fear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Could you not go down there and fetch her away?"</p>

  <p>"Fetch her away! Go to Stanmere! I dare not. If Venner only guessed the
  truth! Oh, if you could only realise the enormity of a crime like mine! If we
  fail now I shall stand in the dock; honest men will turn from me. . . . And I
  shall be struck down without a word of warning. . . . Of course, if it had
  been anybody but Venner. . . . What was I saying?"</p>

  <p>The speaker came back to himself with a start. His eyes were wild with a
  kind of delirium, his grey hair was tangled on his head.</p>

  <p>"I had forgotten," he whispered. "My memory has failed me for a moment.
  Perhaps it is not quite too late. I tell you Mary is at Stanmere; I am
  certain of it. If she has learnt the truth, then the best thing I can do is
  to put a pistol to my head and end my unhappy life."</p>

  <p>"Yours has been a good and noble life, sir," Dick said.</p>

  <p>"Good, noble! I am a whited sepulchre. I am a wretch with blood upon my
  soul. And to forget it I have attempted a stupendous task. It seems strange,
  but without Mary that task is impossible. Around that poor blind girl the
  most tremendous interests resolve. If you could only get her back for me;
  only let me have her again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We can try, sir," Dick said eagerly. "Come along with me to-night. I am
  ready to do anything, and so, I'm sure, is Von Wrangel."</p>

  <p>"Von Wrangel! What an extraordinary coil it all is, to be sure! What is
  that man to you?"</p>

  <p>Dick explained hurriedly. He would have said more, only it had just struck
  him forcibly that Von Wrangel's proposed experiment on Mary's eyes was a
  gross piece of presumption without the consent of her father. All this had
  never occurred to Dick in the joy of the discovery that Mary might see again.
  The thought would not have occurred to Von Wrangel in any case, he was far
  too impulsive and headstrong for that. Dick looked down a little
  guiltily.</p>

  <p>"Von Wrangel is a man with a high reputation," he said.</p>

  <p>"Von Wrangel is one of the finest and most indiscreet men in Europe,"
  Spencer said. "At the risk of still further confusing you, I may say at once
  that Von Wrangel must not see me. Under no circumstances must I come face to
  face with Von Wrangel. If I did so the secret of my life would be exposed,
  the whole story out. Get rid of him, boy; if Mary happily returns to you,
  make some excuse to get him out of the house."</p>

  <p>Dick gave it up as hopeless. He had made more than one ingenious attempt
  to solve the tangle, but at every step it only got worse. Why was this man
  playing at hide-and-seek with all the world? Why did he receive strangers in
  semi-darkness; why were there certain people that he could not meet? And if
  Mary was at Stanmere, what on earth was the reason why her father could not
  fetch her away without all this mystery?</p>

  <p>Spencer seemed to read his thoughts. He smiled at Dick sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>"I am an enigma to you," he said. "I am an enigma to myself. You wonder
  why I don't go down to Stanmere. I might as well proclaim my crime in the
  open street. And yet I am going to speak; in a few months I shall tell the
  truth. . . . I am wandering again. Only, whatever you do, get Von Wrangel out
  of the house without delay."</p>

  <p>"He may have solved the problem by this time," Dick said. "Come down with
  me to Shepherd's Spring. If you will not stay the night, there are plenty of
  very late trains. If we start now we can get to the cottage by 11
  o'clock."</p>

  <p>Mr. Spencer stepped in his restless, impatient stride.</p>

  <p>"I'll come with you," he said. "Anything better than eating one's heart
  out here. If the blow is to fall, I should like it to fall swiftly and
  suddenly. Wait a moment."</p>

  <p>From an inner room Spencer presently emerged with no traces of his recent
  agitation upon him. He looked his benevolent, kindly self, the effect
  heightened by the spectacles he had assumed. The thought of action seemed to
  have lightened his fears.</p>

  <p>"Now I am ready," he said. "Oh, no; I have no blame for you. I have done a
  thing that has been wrong from its very inception, and my sin is finding me
  out."</p>

  <p>He spoke no more till Stanmere was reached, and then he pulled up his
  collar and drew down his hat as if to escape detection. Presently he held up
  his head more jauntily and stepped along with the air of a man who is
  thoroughly at home.</p>

  <p>"How familiar it all seems," he murmured. "I remember when I was a boy
  taking a kite's nest out of those high trees yonder. There were three eggs in
  it, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused again, and did not speak till the cottage was reached. The door
  stood hospitably open, and the hall lamplight streamed down the pathway.
  There was nobody inside, for the maid had gone to bed, and Von Wrangel, with
  Molly, was still, presumably, searching.</p>

  <p>"It is quite safe for the present," Dick said. "Pray come in, sir."</p>

  <p>Spencer stood for a moment with the air of a man who dreams. He crossed to
  the doorway and looked down upon Stanmere, where one or two lights twinkled.
  There was something very wistful in the expression of his face.</p>

  <p>"A house of sorrows," he said, "sorrows that some day may be lifted. Dick,
  there is somebody coming up the road. And that voice sounds like Von
  Wrangel's. I am going inside. If it is absolutely necessary to declare my
  presence, pray do so, but only as a last resort. I am going to sit in the
  little alcove at the bottom of the garden."</p>

  <p>He slipped away and disappeared into the night.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33"></a>XXXIII. &mdash; A RUSSIAN CIGARETTE.</h2>

  <p>Von Wrangel stood deep in thought for a moment or two after Dick had
  gone.</p>

  <p>There was before him a kind of adventure after his own heart. He was very
  nearly on the track of the secret, but there was one point that he had
  over-looked.</p>

  <p>"We are going to find that young lady," he said, "and we are going to look
  for her at Stanmere. Miss Molly, do you know who your visitor is really? You
  don't? Well, I will tell you&mdash;a relative of Lady Stanmere's. Therefore,
  Stanmere is our hunting-ground."</p>

  <p>"But in that case Mary would have let us know," Molly urged.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps she did send a message, which for certain reasons was not
  delivered. There is a mystery here, and two scoundrels to deal with. On the
  whole, they are the worst scoundrels that I know. Do you feel brave enough to
  accompany me?"</p>

  <p>"I feel desperate enough to do anything," Molly replied. "There are very
  few things I would not do to see Mary back again."</p>

  <p>"Then we set out on our search immediately. Ostensibly, we are
  moth-hunting. You shall take the lantern. I have done a great deal of this
  sort of tracking in my time. Come along."</p>

  <p>They passed along till they came to the spot where Molly had seen the last
  of the blind girl. The pathway was soft here, for there were many small
  springs in the heather; and Von Wrangel swept the surface with the powerful
  rays of his acetylene lamp. His keen, dark face lighted up presently.</p>

  <p>"These are footprints," he said. "See, she turned aside for some purpose
  here, for the footprints do not return. Perhaps we shall find them again by
  the other track that leads down by side of the Warren. She couldn't have gone
  farther this way."</p>

  <p>There were three parallel tracks leading by the side of the Warren, and
  over these Von Wrangel ranged with the quickness and silence of a hound. The
  lamp flashed here and there, till presently it stopped in a deep depression
  filled with clay.</p>

  <p>"See here," Von Wrangel whispered. "Here are the footprints again. They
  trend downwards in the direction of Stanmere; and here are large footmarks,
  evidently those of a man. Obviously, Miss Mary paused here and asked her way.
  She must have remained for a minute or two talking, for you can see how the
  man shuffled about. No; there are no marks of a struggle or anything of that
  kind. The man passed upwards, for his prints get fainter as the road hardens
  again. Ah!"</p>

  <p>With a little cry of triumph, Von Wrangel pounced upon a tiny cylinder of
  paper. It was merely the end of a cigarette, but the German eyed it as if he
  had found a great prize.</p>

  <p>"Now, this tells me a good deal," he said. "This is the end of a Russian
  cigarette filled with very fine tobacco. You never see this in shops in the
  country; and, indeed, they are quite an acquired taste, like the French
  Caporal. I only know one man in England who smokes these cigarettes, and it
  is quite easy to account for his being near Stanmere. It was the same man we
  saw the night we were moth-hunting and met Lady Stanmere."</p>

  <p>"But he could not account for Mary's disappearance," Molly cried.</p>

  <p>"Possibly not," Von Wrangel muttered. "But he could account for the
  presence of somebody in the household that Miss Mary wanted to see. The man
  who smoked that cigarette is called Venner. He was once a servant at
  Stanmere."</p>

  <p>"I recollect the name," Molly cried eagerly. "My father told me once of a
  servant of that name who had got into trouble. He married one of the maids at
  Stanmere."</p>

  <p>"He did. Now it so happens that I know Mrs. Venner&mdash;or Nurse Cecilia,
  as she calls herself now&mdash;very well; indeed, she is down here now, and
  her husband has evidently followed her. By chance Miss Mary met the man and
  asked him the way. It is long odds she knew the man and recognised his voice.
  Let us assume that she learnt from Venner that his wife was here. What more
  likely, as she knew the way once she got the proper track again, that she
  should conceive the idea of seeking out her old nurse? My dear young lady, we
  are getting along."</p>

  <p>Molly smiled dubiously. As a piece of reasoning, the argument was not
  without flaw.</p>

  <p>"We will go as far as the house," Von Wrangel went on. "With our
  specimen-case and our lantern we shall not attract any attention, more
  especially as the Warren is the happy hunting-ground for all kinds of
  entomologists. We will go through the Warren."</p>

  <p>They plunged into the darkness of the woods, for there was a short cut for
  those who were familiar with the bypaths of that dense foliage. Von Wrangel
  was quite satisfied in his mind now where Mary was to be found. He was uneasy
  all the same, for he had not forgotten the sound rating he had received from
  Mr. Martlett for betraying to Lady Stanmere that he had come upon traces of
  blind Mary. Doubtless the lady in question had found Mary and refused to part
  with her again. She was a lonely woman, she was passionately fond of the
  girl, and she might even have stooped to deceit to retain her.</p>

  <p>"There are other people hunting specimens here," Molly said. "Don't you
  see those lights? And what a funny way they have of speaking! They are
  gipsies&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel extinguished his lantern hurriedly. He just touched Molly's
  lips as a sign to keep silent. Now that the lantern was out, the other lights
  in front shone out with added brilliancy. Behind them was a small caravan,
  and by the steps two men sat smoking. There was another lamp inside the
  caravan, and by its gleam it was possible to make out a man with his head
  bandaged up lying on a bed.</p>

  <p>"Not a word," Von Wrangel whispered. "Be silent and say nothing. These are
  not gipsies; I only wish they were. They are here on quite another
  errand."</p>

  <p>"They are very picturesque," Molly said. "If there is any
  danger&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No danger for you and me," Von Wrangel said; "but a terrible menace for
  somebody who is not far off. There is another inmate at Stanmere that I never
  expected to see there again."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel spoke in a low agitated whisper that had more horror in it
  than fear.</p>

  <p>"More mystery," Molly whispered. "Who is it this time?"</p>

  <p>"One of Lady Stanmere's sons, Stephen. He has not been at Stanmere for
  many years; he would not be there now unless he were hard pushed indeed. The
  presence of those men by the light yonder tells me all this as plainly as if
  they had put it in words. Stephen has been tracked down here, and they are
  waiting take his life."</p>

  <p>"How dreadful; how horrible! But why?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot go into that now. The man's blood is on his own head. I did my
  best to save him after an act of the blackest treachery that one man has ever
  shown to another. It is not my fault that Stephen has to fly from place to
  place to save his life, knowing that it must be sacrificed in the end. I must
  see him to-night and warn him."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel said no more for the moment. One of the men standing in the
  circle of light tossed the end of his cigarette away and said something to
  his companion. Presently one of them could be seen tending the sick man and
  shaking up his pillows. A moment later all lights were out, including the one
  in the caravan, and the two men set off in opposite directions.</p>

  <p>"They seem to know the ground very well," Molly said, when they were out
  of hearing.</p>

  <p>"They are Black Foresters," Von Wrangel explained. "Woodcraft is second
  nature to them. Give them a few hours and they could find their way anywhere.
  And now you had better let me see you home. There is stern work here that is
  not for a girl, work that makes it impossible for me to go on with our
  original search to-night."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel spoke in his best and purest English now, a sign that he was
  deeply moved. Molly's heart was beating a little faster than usual, but she
  had no fear.</p>

  <p>"I cannot go back," she said. "I will be discreet and silent, I may be of
  use to you. And if your life is in danger&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My own life is in no danger at all. I could drive those men away by
  saying two words. They would crawl at my feet and lick the dust from my shoes
  if I asked them. And then the danger would come back to-morrow for they are
  under an oath, and if they fail there are others to take their places. The
  only chance is to hoodwink them. How it is going to be done I don't know yet,
  but, I shall find a way. And if you really insist upon coming
  along&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel shrugged his shoulders by way of protest. His life and the
  life of his companion were in no danger, but there might be a tragedy
  presently. They went along in silence until they came out into the road by
  the main avenue up to Stanmere.</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel struck boldly into the grounds past the silent lodge, and from
  thence to the terrace. There was a light burning in the hall and another in
  the library, the window of which was open so that it was possible to catch
  the air.</p>

  <p>"What reckless folly," Von Wrangel muttered. "Why does a man deliberately
  invite death like that? He must be here because nobody connected with the
  family is up at this time of night; Lady Stanmere never has any guests.
  Ah!"</p>

  <p>The hall door opened, and two figures stood boldly outlined against the
  brilliant glare. One of the figures stood big and commanding, the other
  abject and pleading. Finally the door was closed and the smaller figure was
  seen creeping along the grass like a worm.</p>

  <p>"Stand here," Von Wrangel whispered. "I shall not be a moment. Where has
  that fellow gone? He seems to have vanished all in a moment."</p>

  <p>"There he is, behind that laurel bush," Molly whispered.</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel went forward quietly. Then his lantern flashed out on the
  startled features of the man who was crouching behind the bush.</p>

  <p>"Venner," he said quietly. "Get up you rascal. You have nothing to fear
  from me as long as you tell the truth. Was that Mr. Stephen who put you
  out?"</p>

  <p>"Ay," Venner growled, "it was; and if ever I get out of this he'll find it
  the very worst day's work he ever did in his life."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch34"
     name="ch34"></a>XXXIV. &mdash; VENNER IN LONDON.</h2>

  <p>The mean face looked uneasily into the ring of light made by the
  acetylene, then the expression of it changed a little. It began to dawn upon
  Venner that he was not in the hands of the police at all. In his first moment
  of despair and anger he was about to say something very much to the detriment
  of his late antagonist. In his own vernacular, he had regarded the game as
  being up.</p>

  <p>But the man concealed behind that blazing line of flame knew him, which
  was a compliment he hardly expected from the police. And there was something
  familiar in the voice, too. There was a bare chance for Venner after all.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you anything," he whispered eagerly. "Only put that light out,
  sir. I don't mind saying that there is somebody looking for me."</p>

  <p>"Somebody who wears a long blue coat with pewter buttons," Von Wrangel
  suggested, "and a bracelet round his wrist. Now get up, since I have to put
  the light out."</p>

  <p>The brilliant line of flame snapped off suddenly, and for a few moments
  Venner could see nothing but dancing spots before his eyes. As the sense of
  sight came back he could see a small, active man standing before him.</p>

  <p>"Name of Greigstein," Von Wrangel said tentatively.</p>

  <p>Venner nodded. The name was quite familiar to him, and he had good reason
  to stand in considerable fear of the man who called himself Greigstein.</p>

  <p>"I know you sir," he muttered. "I&mdash;I didn't expect&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or hope to see me again. Now, you scoundrel, tell me the truth.
  Otherwise, you will do no mischief for a long time to come."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel's voice was hard and full of contempt. Venner wriggled in a
  fawning kind of way before the man who was so much smaller then himself.</p>

  <p>"I'm doing no harm, sir," he said. "I swear I was doing no harm at
  Stanmere. I came down to see my wife. There was a little misunderstanding
  about a watch."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel smiled. He had a pretty good grip of the situation.</p>

  <p>"And the police followed you down here," he said. "You were hiding in the
  house, and Mr. Stephen found you and put you out. Possibly&mdash;nay, most
  assuredly&mdash;you were going away with a certain amount of portable
  property in your possession. Was that right?"</p>

  <p>Venner mumbled something in reply.</p>

  <p>"Now, I want you to tell me exactly what happened," Von Wrangel went on.
  "Let me have chapter and verse, and don't forget anything. Who are present in
  the house at this moment besides Lady Stanmere and the servants?"</p>

  <p>"My wife," Venner explained, "Mr. Stephen, and Miss Mary."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel had discovered everything that he wanted to know. From first
  to last all his deductions had been logically correct. Molly, standing
  motionless within shadow, listened with the deepest admiration.</p>

  <p>"You saw Miss Mary this afternoon," Von Wrangel went on, "you met her by
  the Warren, and you put her back in the path again. And you took advantage of
  the opportunity to get her to put in a good word for you with your wife."</p>

  <p>Venner gasped. Cleverness of this kind always appealed to him. It was the
  one attribute he longed for. With that he might have taken a high place among
  criminals, instead of being a poor, vulgar blackmailing rascal.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how you do it, sir," he said, "but it's all true as gospel.
  And it isn't as if you could possibly have seen the young lady. If you'd only
  be clever enough to get me beyond the lodge gate I should admire you more
  than ever."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel smiled. That was precisely what he was going to do.
  Personally, he would have preferred to hand the fellow over to the police and
  get him out of the way for a time, but there was something pressing to be
  done, and here was the tool ready forged to his hand.</p>

  <p>"Your lucky star is certainly a rising one to-night," he said. "Our
  greatest blessings often come in disguise. For instance, it was a blessing
  for you that Mr. Stephen kicked you out of the house. Otherwise you would
  assuredly have fallen into the hands of the police. Now you are going to
  escape them and take a message for me somewhere."</p>

  <p>Venner was effusively grateful, so grateful that Von Wrangel felt a strong
  temptation to box his ears. He took from his pocket a small enamelled button,
  much like those so popular during the war fever, and handed it over to
  Venner.</p>

  <p>"Now let me have a pencil and a scrap of paper," he said. "I write an
  address here that you are to put into your pocket. As soon as you are back in
  London, no matter what time of the day or night it is, go to the address on
  the paper and leave the button there. Give no message and ask no questions,
  and that is all I require. Have you any money?"</p>

  <p>With a gleam of hope in his eyes Venner confessed that he had nothing. A
  moment later and his eager fingers were clenched upon a sovereign. There was
  a turn of Von Wrangel's wrist, and the long line of flame flashed out once
  more. Venner started in dismay.</p>

  <p>"If you want to spoil everything, sir&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>But Von Wrangel knew what he was doing. At the back of that flame it was
  impossible to see anything. The light flashed here and there, and the little
  German began to discuss eagerly on his favourite topic. He was nothing now
  beyond a gentleman engaged in moth-hunting. As he moved steadily on, talking
  to Molly all the time, Venner followed on his hands and knees. Presently a
  gruff voice gave a challenge out of the darkness.</p>

  <p>"That is my friend Lawman!" Von Wrangel cried. "My friend who makes all
  the London squares possible at night for an enthusiastic entomologist. Are
  you hunting specimens, too?"</p>

  <p>"Not your sort!" came a voice came out of the darkness. "I have reason to
  believe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Always be cautious; reason to believe is always a good formula. You want
  a tall man in a grey suit, who is a ludicrous caricature of a gentleman?
  Between ourselves, my dear sir, you are not likely to find him. I have every
  reason to believe that the bird has flown. In your place I should try the
  road on the way to Formly. The man is not in the house!"</p>

  <p>"You are quite sure of that, sir?" the officer asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely! I saw him expelled just now with some violence. If I can help
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the officer had gone. Gradually Von Wrangel worked down to the lodge
  gates, where there was a loose stone or two in the fence. He turned upon
  Venner.</p>

  <p>"Now is your chance," he said. "Over you go. And remember what I told
  Inspector Lawman. Keep off the Formly road and you will be all right."</p>

  <p>Venner needed no second bidding. He was over the wall and across the road
  in a minute. Von Wrangel turned to Molly with a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to be rid of that scoundrel," he said; "he poisons the air
  around him. Much as I should have liked to lay him by the heels I did not do
  so, because I had other uses for him. My message to London was urgent, and
  may result in averting a tragedy. And now, my dear young lady, we are going
  back to the house again. It may be that I shall want to do a little amateur
  burglary myself before very long."</p>

  <p>They were back on the terrace in front of the house again presently. Only
  the library window was lighted up and still stood open. Suddenly a light
  flashed out in a bedroom, the casement was pushed open and a woman's face
  peered out.</p>

  <p>"Look," Molly whispered; "it is Mary. Shall I call to her?"</p>

  <p>Mary was gazing pensively out of the window as if she was taking in the
  darkness of the night. Von Wrangel watched her with his hand on Molly's
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Better not," he suggested. "We know where she is, and that she is safe.
  To speak now might be to bring about the very thing that we want to avoid. If
  I could only see to the bottom of the strange tangle and the reason for all
  this secrecy!"</p>

  <p>The speaker paused and looked at Molly as if she had suddenly struck him.
  The expression in his eyes was that of a man who has made an amazing
  discovery&mdash;something that he ought to have seen long ago. He drew Molly
  a little further down the terrace. There was no longer a figure looking
  pensively out of the bedroom window.</p>

  <p>"I am the greatest fool in the universe," Von Wrangel said. "I have had a
  thing simple as an alphabet before my eyes and I could not read it. Now that
  I have read it, I see my way to great things. Miss Molly, Dick has gone to
  see the parent, guardian, what you will, of the young lady upstairs. It is
  more than possible that this guardian will come back with Dick."</p>

  <p>"More than likely," Molly agreed.</p>

  <p>"Myself, I think that such a course is inevitable. Therefore I am going to
  tax your good nature. You are not afraid to go back to Shepherd's Spring
  alone?"</p>

  <p>Molly smiled at the suggestion.</p>

  <p>"You are a good and brave girl," Von Wrangel said, approvingly. "Go back
  home and wait till Dick and his friend come. If they have already arrived say
  that I require them here. The guardian will probably demur; he may say that
  he has the strongest possible reason for not seeing Von Wrangel at this
  particular moment. If he urges this, you may reply that I know it. Say, Von
  Wrangel has found you out!"</p>

  <p>Molly nodded. She would have liked to ask questions, but it was neither
  the time nor place for that. She had only to carry out the instructions of a
  man who knew quite well what he was talking about.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said; "I will do what you say. And if he refuses
  this?"</p>

  <p>"Then I shall most assuredly come and fetch him. My dear girl, if you only
  knew what great results depend upon the success of your mission!"</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel said no more; and with a nod of her head, Molly went off
  towards the garden and entrance to Stanmere. It was very dark and still
  there, but she was not in the least afraid. She pushed on with a firm step
  and a resolution to succeed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch35"
     name="ch35"></a>XXXV. &mdash; THE WRITING ON THE TABLET.</h2>

  <p>A welcome light streamed out from the cottage as Molly breasted the hill.
  She called to Dick as Spencer slipped down the garden, under the impression
  that she was not alone. Dick came out into the porch to meet her eagerly.</p>

  <p>"You are very late," he said. "Have you got any news?"</p>

  <p>Molly explained what had happened, breathlessly. From first to last Von
  Wrangel had made no kind of mistake; and, anyway, Mary was perfectly safe
  where she was. Molly looked round her as if expecting to see somebody; and
  Dick smiled.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Spencer is here," he said. "He thought he heard Von Wrangel's voice,
  and so he stepped down the garden into the arbor. He particularly doesn't
  want to see Von Wrangel."</p>

  <p>"Which, I am afraid, he will have to do," Molly said, "seeing that I am
  sent back by our German friend especially to fetch him. Go and bring Mr.
  Spencer here."</p>

  <p>Dick came back a minute later with Mr. Spencer dragging behind. The white
  anxious face lighted up as he saw Molly. He held her hand for a moment or
  two, and looked searchingly into her eyes. The pretty, kindly face pleased
  him.</p>

  <p>"I am not blaming anyone for the disaster," he said. "Sooner or later
  something of the kind was bound to happen. But where is she?"</p>

  <p>"Mary is quite safe," Molly explained. "She is at Stanmere. I have
  actually seen her. And, thanks to the wonderful astuteness of Von Wrangel, I
  know exactly how she got to Stanmere. If she had not had the ill fortune to
  meet Venner&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What?" Spencer asked, hoarsely. "What name did you say?"</p>

  <p>All the haggard anxiety had come back to his face again. He fell back in a
  chair as if his limbs had suddenly failed him.</p>

  <p>"That rascal at every turn," he said, speaking to himself. "And so near as
  that! But perhaps my fears are in vain. My dear young lady, will you please
  tell me everything from the beginning. Never has there been a narrative with
  a more attentive listener."</p>

  <p>"It must have been a coincidence," Molly exclaimed. "Venner was here only
  to see his wife, who might have got him out of a serious trouble. He had
  concealed himself in the house, and Mr. Stephen found him. It was Mr. Stephen
  who put him out."</p>

  <p>"And who is Mr. Stephen?" Spencer asked, with his hand to his head.
  "Really, I am getting afraid that one of my mental attacks is coming on. The
  worry of the evening has tried me terribly. Now, where have I heard the name
  of Stephen before?"</p>

  <p>He rose from his chair and paced up and down the room with the pettishness
  of a man who has for the moment forgotten a name and a place. He tapped his
  forehead and muttered to himself. Then he paused, and a strange cry escaped
  him.</p>

  <p>"Stephen," he said. "Oh, I know, I know, I know. Stephen in that house
  under the same roof as Mary! The thing is maddening, not to be endured. To
  think that Stephen should be there of all places in the world! Why did he go,
  and what does it mean?"</p>

  <p>Apparently the speaker had forgotten where he was. He raved up and down
  the room until the touch of Molly's hand brought him to himself.</p>

  <p>"My crime is going to find me out," he said. "After all these years the
  truth will be told. And my work is not yet finished. What can I do?"</p>

  <p>"Come and see Von Wrangel," Molly said presently.</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady, I cannot. I particularly desire not to see Von
  Wrangel. I don't want him to know the truth."</p>

  <p>"But I am afraid he knows everything," Molly urged. "He sent me back to
  fetch you. He was talking to me quietly when suddenly he seemed to make some
  stupendous discovery. He said it was pretty certain that you would come down
  here with Dick, and he sent me back for you. If you declined to come, I was
  to say that he had found you out."</p>

  <p>Spencer nodded with the air of a man who is beaten.</p>

  <p>"After that I have no more to say," he murmured, "before long the whole
  world will have found me out. But Von Wrangel is a clever man, and he may
  find some way through the difficulty. On the other hand, he may be embarked
  upon one of his wild, visionary schemes that will make confusion worse
  confounded. Still, I will see him&mdash;anything is better than this
  maddening inaction."</p>

  <p>He strode out into the porch resolutely enough. In a measure he reminded
  Dick of the hunted criminal who is caught at last and feels a kind of
  pleasure in the fact that the strain has vanished. They passed in silence by
  the Warren, and from thence into the grounds at Stanmere, where they waited.
  Von Wrangel was not to be seen, but there were voices coming from the
  direction of the library window.</p>

  <p>"We had better stand here," Molly whispered. "Let us trust our friend
  implicitly. He will come to us if we only have patience."</p>

  <p>Left to himself, Von Wrangel had not been idle. He carefully selected a
  cigarette from his case and lighted it. Just for a moment he stood as if
  getting an inspiration and enjoyment from his tobacco, and then he crossed
  the terrace and entered the library quietly. His step was so soft on the
  thick carpet that the occupant of the room had no notion of his presence.</p>

  <p>Stephen sat on one chair with his feet on another enjoying his cigar to
  the full. It was a long time since he had sat in a room like this, dressed as
  a gentleman and surrounded by all the luxuries that the heart could
  desire.</p>

  <p>There was a sense of soothing satisfaction about it all. Had he not been a
  reckless, headstrong individual, and a great rascal to boot, he might have
  spent the rest of his days here. Really there was something in a refined home
  after all. It was all so artistic and graceful; those electric lights blended
  so well with the surroundings. Stephen Gay was in the frame of mind when most
  people of his class wish that they had been better men.</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel reached over and tapped him on the shoulder. He turned round
  with a sudden cry and a horrible grey pallor on his face for a moment.</p>

  <p>"No way of getting rid of you," he said coolly. His teeth chattered still,
  and the ashy hue was still on his lips. "Where did you come from?"</p>

  <p>"My good Stephen, the reply is obvious. I came by the way of the window.
  You are as foolishly reckless as usual, I see. It might as well have
  been&mdash;somebody else."</p>

  <p>Stephen Gay shuddered slightly. He was not a man of much imagination, but
  he seemed to see a little now in the suggestion of the darkness outside.</p>

  <p>"Somebody else is far off," he said.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, somebody else is very close. It in not the slightest use
  for you to try and deceive me. If I ask you why you are here, you will tell
  me a lie. But I am not going to ask you, became I know why you are here
  perfectly well. You are at your last gasp; you were at the end of your
  resources and the danger was horribly close. I know perfectly well that you
  must have been hard pressed to come to Stanmere at all. You had to fight for
  your life&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I had. And I gave better than I got; I killed that man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, you didn't. He is much better than you anticipate."</p>

  <p>Gay looked at the speaker uneasily. He seemed to know more than he cared
  to say.</p>

  <p>"I am not going to tell you where I got my information from," Von Wrangel
  went on. "But you are in a greater danger than you imagine. If I get you out
  of that danger I shall be a much cleverer individual than I take myself for.
  Still, for the sake of the family and the old times, I am going to
  try&mdash;for the sake of the girl."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about the girl," Gay cried. "Before Heaven, nothing. She
  may be near to me, she may be at the far end of the world, for all I know.
  But when I free myself from the millstone about my neck, I am going to
  know."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel nodded. Not a muscle of his face moved. On the whole he was
  doing a most magnificent night's work.</p>

  <p>"I fancy I shall be able to help you in that respect a little later on,"
  he said. "But that must keep for the present. As a man once high in the
  profession that I once hoped to adorn&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You know where the girl is?" Gay cried.</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel said nothing; he would have prevaricated, but Gay caught the
  expression of his face. There was a strange gleam in the latter's eyes as he
  turned away.</p>

  <p>"No possibility of getting back her eye-sight?" he asked carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Talk not to me of possibilities," Von Wrangel cried. The professional
  enthusiasm was on fire in no time, also his prudence was cast to the winds.
  He was for the moment that strange uncertain mixture that caused Martlett to
  distrust him. Up to a certain point nobody could exceed him in prudence and
  discretion, but touch his enthusiasm and he was a child.</p>

  <p>"It is out of the question," Gay said, in the same careless tone.</p>

  <p>"It shall be done," Von Wrangel said. "I tell you it shall be done. It
  shall come as a secret, but those eyes shall be opened once more
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel paused. He would have bitten his tongue out for the
  indiscretion. For Gay was lying back in his chair given over to noiseless
  mirth. He wriggled and twisted about in a perfect ecstacy of pleasure. His
  sinister eyes were full of amusement.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you are clever," he said, "you know everything. You are a statesman
  with the heart of a child, a born diplomat with the tongue of a woman. As a
  general you might be trusted either to win a great victory or invite the
  enemy to tea. Go on, my dear Von Wrangel, restore that girl's sight. To think
  of it, only to think of it!"</p>

  <p>He rolled about again in the same fiendish glee. There was no real
  pleasure or emotion or gladness about him; his feelings were not touched in
  the least. Von Wrangel stepped towards him in a sudden outburst of rage.</p>

  <p>"Bete!" he cried, "beast. Have you no feelings? Ah, it were far better if
  I left you to your fate."</p>

  <p>Gay calmed down a little and wiped the tears from his eyes. There was
  something in the aspect of the other that silenced him.</p>

  <p>"Have you really come to help me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," Von Wrangel said candidly, "I have not. You are only a pawn in the
  game, but if I can prevent the pawn from having his throat cut, for the sake
  of the family I shall be glad. I don't think you quite realise the full
  measure of your danger."</p>

  <p>Gay waved his cigar contemptuously. He had not been in quite so easy and
  sanguine a frame of mind when he came down to Stanmere.</p>

  <p>"You profess to know," he said. "I will be guided by you. Now, what is it
  to be? Something plain and straightforward, or a little theatrical? If you
  consider my feelings&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't consider you or your feelings in the slightest," Von Wrangel
  burst out furiously. "I can live here for a far better and nobler purpose
  than that. I am here to save the honour and good name,&mdash;ay, and the good
  fortune, too&mdash;of the house. I have been puzzled, but I am puzzled no
  longer. Ah, if I told you one thing that I know, you would be kneeling at my
  feet and imploring me to show you some way out. But I shall not tell you that
  unless I am driven to an extremity, unless you force me to make you a
  nerveless puppet in my hands."</p>

  <p>"Always theatrical," Gay sneered. "Go on; what shall I do?"</p>

  <p>Without retort Von Wrangel crossed the room and pulled up the blind, so
  that the full brilliancy of the electrics made it light and bright as day.
  Anyone standing outside could have seen everything that went on in the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Go and stand there," Von Wrangel said. "Stand there for three minutes by
  the clock. Can you see anything to enlighten you?"</p>

  <p>There was nothing but the black darkness behind the band of light.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch36"
     name="ch36"></a>XXXVI. &mdash; MORE BLIND THAN ONE.</h2>

  <p>Stephen Gay stood there with the brilliant light behind him, smiling in a
  way that expressed his contempt for the whole proceedings. The thing seemed
  so utterly false and theatrical. And in any case Stanmere was no setting for
  this kind of thing. The mysterious in connection with so fine a place was
  absurd. Nothing cheap or tawdry had ever existed there; the old walls and
  trim lawns protested against any suggestion of that kind.</p>

  <p>And Lady Stanmere, placid and most gentle of women, was lying asleep
  upstairs in happy ignorance of all that was going on. Gay laughed.</p>

  <p>"The setting is wrong," he said. "It should be a gaudy scene in a
  transpontine theatre."</p>

  <p>"It is quite fitting," said Von Wrangel. "There are other houses, older
  and grander by far, where worse tragedies than these have taken place. And
  what could be more dramatic than the home-coming of the scoundrel of a son
  who broke his mother's heart and drove his father to a suicide's grave? In
  that respect, what is the matter with you?"</p>

  <p>Gay was silent for a moment. He had a wholesome respect for Von Wrangel's
  tongue when it was once started.</p>

  <p>"What have I to be afraid of?" he asked sullenly.</p>

  <p>"That you best know yourself, but if I give you the succession to Stanmere
  you would not dare to cross the park to-night. I am doing my best to save
  your life, unworthy as you are. If you were not so utterly and hopelessly
  blind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel paused and stopped altogether. The unexpected had
  happened&mdash;a thing that threatened to upset his plans altogether, he had
  not calculated on anything like this. For Mary was in the room&mdash;Mary,
  still in her white dress, feeling her way delicately and deliberately into
  the room, her face anxious, eager and quivering. Just for a moment Von
  Wrangel's hand shot out as if he would have taken Gay by the throat and
  strangled him.</p>

  <p>There was no time to think, to scheme anything now. A wild idea of taking
  the girl in his arms, of carrying her away before she could speak, was
  rejected. Then Gay half-turned to know the reason why Von Wrangel had broken
  off so abruptly.</p>

  <p>His eyes fell on the white, silent figure before them. Like Von Wrangel,
  he said nothing; he was too overcome for words. There was a queer, dry, ugly
  smile on his face&mdash;an evil, vindictive triumph that was not lost on Von
  Wrangel. All the fierce, wild blood was boiling in the latter now; he met the
  shifting glance in Gay's eyes.</p>

  <p>There all at once was one of the most dangerous and reckless conspirators
  in Europe. There was murder in Von Wrangel's eyes. With his finger to his
  lips he was exhorting Gay to silence, and with those flashing eyes telling
  him plainly it was more than his life's worth to speak. And if Gay was no
  coward, he knew the reputation that Von Wrangel had enjoyed in the old days.
  He shifted his ground moodily; he could afford to smile, to wait the turn of
  events. With those speaking eyes upon him he kept silence.</p>

  <p>Mary advanced to the centre of the room. She looked white and distressed,
  and the blue eyes were more pathetic than usual.</p>

  <p>"I could not sleep," she said. "I had no business to stay here; I ought to
  have gone back to my friends. Why don't you speak to me, Mr. Greigstein? I
  heard you talking as I came into the room. And there is somebody with
  you."</p>

  <p>"Somebody else here?" Von Wrangel stammered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. I can FEEL somebody else. I don't understand it at all; I don't
  understand why you are here, but I daresay it is all right."</p>

  <p>"A patient of mine," said Von Wrangel, very quietly and steadily; "a
  patient of mine. You see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, blind, like myself," Mary cried. "I heard you say so as I came in.
  Will you please say how sorry I am for him? It is dreadful to be like
  that."</p>

  <p>"He is the blindest man in the world," said Von Wrangel, crossing the room
  as if to whisper to Mary, and yet keeping a glittering, basilisk eye on Gay
  all the time. "Nobody ever saw anybody so blind. But I am in hopes of curing
  him. As a matter of fact, I was reading a letter to him when you came in. It
  is a letter in cypher, and contains some of the strangest phrases you ever
  read. Now, what do you think of this sentence? 'The red-headed man is waiting
  outside. If you say any more now, you will only have yourself to blame if I
  leave you to yourself.'"</p>

  <p>Every word was spoken slowly and with great distinctness. The effect of
  the words upon Gay was extraordinary. He dropped back in his chair with a
  queer choking cry on his lips. The beads had gathered like a heavy dew on his
  forehead. Every scrap of fight had gone out of him.</p>

  <p>"Your friend is not well," Mary said, with the sweetest sympathy.</p>

  <p>Her eyes were turned by a kind of instinct to the chair where Gay was all
  huddled and twisted. It was a strange scene&mdash;the perfectly-appointed
  room, the brilliant bath of shaded lights, the beautiful pathetic face of the
  girl, half-puzzled and full of sympathy, the grinning triumph on the face of
  Von Wrangel, and the abject misery on that of Gay.</p>

  <p>"He has heart spasms," he said. "There is nothing like air for heart
  spasms. I will lead my friend into the open and place him on one of the
  garden seats. Then, Miss Mary, I will come back and have a few words with
  you. Your arm, my friend."</p>

  <p>Gay rose from his seat. Not one word had been uttered, he seemed too
  docile for that. He followed, leaning on the arm of Von Wrangel as if he had
  grown suddenly old. He dropped down suddenly on a seat outside. Then he found
  his voice.</p>

  <p>"You are lying to me," he said hoarsely. "You lied because fate placed
  such a chance in my hands, and you did not intend me to use it. You know the
  truth."</p>

  <p>"I do not intend you to use it," Von Wrangel said coldly. "Yes, I know the
  truth. But I did not guess it till to-night, which shows how liable even the
  most wise of us are to err. But I am not lying to you. When did I ever lie
  deliberately to anybody?"</p>

  <p>Gay conceded the point gracefully enough.</p>

  <p>"The man you have most cause to dread is close by," Von Wrangel went on.
  "He has traced you to the house. I have done my best to save you. I have
  given up much to save the man who lied and tricked me out of the woman I
  loved, and who loved me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Good heavens! You have found that out, too?"</p>

  <p>"I know everything. But there is a certain society sworn to avenge
  traitors. What sort of a traitor you have been I need not say. If I had the
  men who are following you hard by the heels, others would spring up to take
  their place to-morrow. What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>Gay shivered miserably and kept silent.</p>

  <p>"Precisely. You are at your wit's end. You have no plans. If you could get
  beyond the cordon you would be safe for a little time, perhaps for years. But
  the man whose hair is red is here, and you fear him more than anything in the
  world. Still, I can save you."</p>

  <p>"If there is anybody who can do it you are the man," Gay muttered.</p>

  <p>"I am going to try, not so much for your sake, as for others. You were
  going to do a cruel thing to-night; you were going to bring ruin and disgrace
  upon innocent people. But you read murder in my eyes, and you were afraid to
  speak. By all that I hold sacred, I would have killed you had you said one
  single syllable to that girl to-night."</p>

  <p>Gay nodded. He knew that perfectly well.</p>

  <p>"And she is going to save you," Von Wrangel went on. "She is going to
  snatch you out of the net, and if you say one word to her all will be lost.
  She will be by your side, but you are to remain silent. Her arm will be on
  yours, but, you shall not utter a sound. I shall not need, because I know now
  that you dare not speak."</p>

  <p>"I will be discreet and silent," Gay said.</p>

  <p>"Ah! So we understand one another. You remain here whilst I go back to
  that room. You are going to have another surprise presently&mdash;in fact, a
  night of surprises. Don't move till I return for you. You are safe where you
  are."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel stepped back into the library again. Mary stood there waiting
  with the pathetic patience peculiar to her misfortune. Her face was very
  white and miserable, but there was no suspicion there. She trusted everybody
  too implicitly for that.</p>

  <p>"It is Mr. Greigstein," she said tentatively. "Now will you tell me what
  it all means? I am not going to ask why you are here, when only to-day you
  went to London with Dick&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I might ask why you are here," said Von Wrangel, "since I left you safe
  with friends whom your father had chosen to look after you. From the bottom
  of my heart I am sorry for you. I deeply regret the mystery that seems to
  surround you. If you had stayed where you were&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With all my heart I wish it," Mary said passionately. "But I met a
  man&mdash;a bad man,&mdash;who was going to do an evil thing, and I yielded
  to impulse. And then Lady Stanmere found me. Was she glad to see me? Well,
  that is a mild way to express her happiness. Mr. Greigstein, I am a poor
  blind girl, who sees nothing and who has to take all that is told her on
  trust. Why am I shifted about from place to place like a criminal flying from
  justice. Why should I not come down here, where I was so happy years ago? Is
  it fair that I should not be trusted? Is it just that I should be kept in the
  dark like this? If I cared for my father less&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your father is one of the best men in the world," Von Wrangel hastened to
  reply. "But he has a heavy cross to bear, far heavier than you imagine. If
  you refuse to share it with him, all his efforts are in vain. If you elect to
  stay here, there is an end of everything."</p>

  <p>Mary listened with tears in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I will not be wayward," she said; "but it is all so very hard to bear. I
  thought I would stay here for the night and get Cecilia to help me in the
  morning. But I could not sleep. I felt so guilty I came down here to try and
  find my way out. Then I could see that there were lights here, and I heard
  your voice. I ought to have been surprised, but latterly I am surprised at
  nothing. Now, what do you think I had better do?"</p>

  <p>"Come with me a little way," Von Wrangel said promptly, "and have a little
  talk with Miss Molly, who is waiting outside to see you."</p>

  <p>"And if I can explain to her," Mary said eagerly. "I can perhaps
  stay."</p>

  <p>"To-night, at any rate," Von Wrangel said. "I can avert the danger so that
  you may remain for the present, and you shall hear your father say so. But,
  first of all, you will have to take a little walk and ask no questions. After
  that I can promise you a long spell of peace."</p>

  <p>Mary was quite ready to do anything that she was asked now. If she could
  only satisfy her new friends that she had done no wrong, and please Lady
  Stanmere at the same time, she would be happy. And there was a deep note of
  sincerity and power in Von Wrangel's tones.</p>

  <p>"Then come along," he said; "there is no time like the present."</p>

  <p>He touched Mary's finger tips, and she laid her hand on his arm. A moment
  or two later, in the garden, she was talking eagerly to Molly and Dick. Von
  Wrangel had promptly drawn Spencer apart from the others. He led him up to
  the library windows. Somebody inside there was pacing up and down on the far
  side of the room. The footstep was muffled, but Spencer seemed to recognise
  it.</p>

  <p>"Now listen to that," Von Wrangel said. "Paul, I have found you out. It
  was only to-night that the whole conspiracy came upon me like a flash. I know
  all the mystery now, and the reason for it. Your daughter is here, as you
  know. There is no reason she should not stay&mdash;if a certain person is out
  of the way. That certain person is here."</p>

  <p>"Here!" Spencer stammered. "Under this very roof!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, under this very roof. There! Keep calm. No cause for agitation.
  Listen!"</p>

  <p>The muffled footsteps went up and down&mdash;the footsteps of Gay, who had
  returned to the library at a signal from Von Wrangel, as he passed with Mary
  on his arm.</p>

  <p>"That's the step," Spencer gasped; "the step that has haunted me for
  years. I cannot stand it, Von Wrangel&mdash;take me away, for I am in danger
  of my life. I must go."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel grasped the speaker firmly by the arm.</p>

  <p>"You are going," he said, "going with me into that room!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch37"
     name="ch37"></a>XXXVII. &mdash; FACE TO FACE.</h2>

  <p>Spencer regarded his companion with a sort of frozen horror on his face.
  Go into that room, deliberately face the man he had been avoiding for years,
  wreck the whole fabric of his life!</p>

  <p>"I cannot do it," he said hoarsely. "Oh, it is impossible! If you only
  knew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My good Paul, I know a great deal more than you imagine. I have clipped
  the claws of the tiger&mdash;at least, others have done it for me. How long
  do you require to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Give me a year's immunity and I care not what happens then."</p>

  <p>"You shall have your year, and perhaps more. But it is in your hands to
  purchase that 12 months of freedom. The tiger is in great danger."</p>

  <p>"But if he should happen to see Mary&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He HAS seen her. To-night face to face. But I found the means to silence
  his tongue, and he did not speak. And he has his own peril to occupy his mind
  to-night. You know what he did; you know that sooner or later the traitor
  must pay the penalty. Somewhere in the darkness, close by, the danger lies
  hidden. If you can get Stephen past that danger, and you can&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I! What have I to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Merely to help me. Merely to stand in a certain position and smoke a
  cigar for half an hour. The amazing likeness between you two&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I see," Spencer cried. "I begin to understand. And Stephen will have to
  fly. You are indiscreet sometimes, my dear Von Wrangel, but when you turn
  your mind to a thing you are marvellous. I am a great coward; my nerve is not
  what it used to be, but you inspire me. Lead the way; I am quite sure that
  you are going to save me."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel passed through the open window. Gay was still pacing up and
  down inside. The broad band of light showed up his white, agitated face. The
  expression changed altogether as he saw the man who followed Von Wrangel into
  the room.</p>

  <p>"A pleasant and unexpected meeting," he said, "a gathering of the clan.
  How dare you come into my presence like this, you rascally thief? If you
  recognised our danger&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is no danger," Von Wrangel said, with cold contempt. "You will have
  enough to save your own skin intact. And here is a method of safety. Accident
  has favoured you. A little time ago I asked you to stand in that light and
  smoke a cigar. You sneered at me. Well, you know now who was watching you all
  the time."</p>

  <p>Gay shuddered, and his face grew perceptibly paler.</p>

  <p>"I brought this gentleman here," Von Wrangel went on. "You have seen his
  face, but nobody else has. I want him to sit in that corner with his back to
  the light. Paul, I presume you dined before you came down here this evening?
  Good. Keep your overcoat on for the present. We shall need it for Stephen
  presently."</p>

  <p>"What's going to happen?" Stephen asked sullenly.</p>

  <p>"You are coming with Miss Mary and myself to the lodge gates," Von Wrangel
  explained. "You will wear your brother's overcoat, you will have the young
  lady on your arm as if she was seeing you off the place, and you will have me
  for your other companion. Then Paul will stand all the time at the window
  with a cigar in his lips. The likeness the amazing resemblance from a little
  way off&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A shout of admiration broke from Gay.</p>

  <p>"Admirable!" he cried. "I shall trick the assassins yet. And if they steal
  up and kill yonder thief, the whole thing will be complete. 'He who fights
  and runs away,' you know. And when I come back, look to yourself."</p>

  <p>He turned threateningly upon Spencer. The latter said nothing, but stood
  with his eyes on the carpet. A strange smile came over Gay's face.</p>

  <p>"But I am going to have another revenge," he said. "Von Wrangel forecasted
  it. The mere thought of it will keep me warm many a cold night. And you won't
  be able to avert it; the very man who calls himself your friend will bring it
  about."</p>

  <p>Gay was shaking with secret mirth. Even in the midst of his danger he
  seemed incapable of thinking of anything else for the moment. Von Wrangel
  regarded him with a puzzled expression.</p>

  <p>"Come along," he said impatiently; "there is no time to lose. Paul, will
  you take off your coat and hand it to Stephen? In the corner, please. That
  will do nicely. Now, Paul, will you be so good as to stand in the window and
  smoke a cigar? You must stand there, looking out into the night, till I come
  back. There is no danger as long as you don't leave the house. Meanwhile,
  Stephen and myself are going round by a back way. Come along."</p>

  <p>Spencer stood there, apparently calmly looking into the night, and
  tranquilly smoking his cigar. As a matter of fact, his whole mind was in a
  confused whirl. He could make out the figure of Von Wrangel presently, and
  then he saw the German disappear, with something white by his side. He had
  left Gay in the thicket behind the house, and then he reappeared with
  Mary.</p>

  <p>"Now let us hope this is the last of the mysteries," he said, as he drew
  the girl's arm through his. "You are to be discreet, and speak when you are
  spoken to. The other man&mdash;my patient&mdash;will be with us, but he will
  not say one word. You understand?"</p>

  <p>Mary quite understood. She had not the remotest idea where she was now,
  but she felt quite safe with Von Wrangel. She was cognisant presently of a
  further footstep, and then her hand was transferred from Von Wrangel to the
  arm of somebody else. Something seemed to be flashing before her eyes. The
  German had his lamp out again; he was dilating upon his hobby. Though he
  chatted on in his most easy and inconsequent manner his face was deadly
  white, and he paused from time to time to wipe his forehead. At every bush he
  passed he took care to keep the dazzling light between it and the silent
  twain that he was piloting towards the road.</p>

  <p>Looking back from the avenue it was possible to make out the dim outline
  of the figure smoking in the library window, and so far all had gone well.
  But there was a strain upon Von Wrangel that he was feeling terribly. It was
  only a few minutes now between his companion and safety, but the minutes
  dragged on like the hours of a dull day.</p>

  <p>Above all, it was imperative to avoid anything that looked like haste. Von
  Wrangel stepped from place to place, flashing his lantern here and there, and
  chatting all the time. He was listening intently with all his ears. Mary was
  nervous and distraught, and made short replies to the many questions put to
  her; her companion was rigidly silent.</p>

  <p>The roadway was reached at length, and the lodge gates passed. Von Wrangel
  shut up the slide of his lantern, and gave a deep sigh of relief. He bade
  Mary stand aside for a moment whilst he drew her reticent companion a little
  further down the road.</p>

  <p>"It is all plain sailing now," he said. "Fortunately, you know the way. We
  have baffled those people, and you have got the start you require. If you
  require funds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't. My mother supplied funds this morning."</p>

  <p>"Very good. You had better go abroad. England is no place for you at
  present."</p>

  <p>"And I shall be snugly out of the way," Gay said, bitterly. "Circumstances
  have been too strong for me to-night, or I should have upset the pretty
  scheme of friend Paul. But I am going to have my revenge. Oh, if I could only
  be here to see it!"</p>

  <p>He laughed again in the same noiseless manner, waving his hand to Von
  Wrangel, and plunged into the darkness, leaving the latter a little disgusted
  and puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Well, he's gone, at any rate," the German muttered. "It ought to be all
  smooth for some time to come. A few years ago I should have enjoyed an
  adventure like this. As it is, my limbs shake as if I had an attack of
  ague."</p>

  <p>Mary was standing there, white and patient. She sighed as Von Wrangel
  touched her.</p>

  <p>"Did I play my part well?" she asked. "It seems to me that I'm doing
  nothing else just now but play patience. If I could only see, I might enjoy
  this. But it is dreadful to be in the dark like this. Tell me, are you
  satisfied?"</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel was even more than satisfied.</p>

  <p>"Now you can go back to bed with a clear conscience. Only when you get
  inside take care to fasten the window behind you. As to the rest, it is
  between your father and yourself. I have done my work, and I flatter myself
  that I have done it well. Now I am going to see you home by the side
  entrance, and atone for my act of burglary by restoring the lost property
  that Lady Stanmere values so much."</p>

  <p>It was all over at length. Mary had crept back to her old familiar room
  with her mind in a whirl and a feeling of utter fatigue. And yet to a certain
  extent she had brought it all upon herself. Perhaps now she might be allowed
  to remain here; she might even be permitted to spend her time between
  Stanmere and Shepherd's spring. She might&mdash;</p>

  <p>Down below the figure in evening dress was still smoking in the window.
  Dick and Molly were seated exactly where Von Wrangel had left them. The
  German came along presently, and passed to the far edge of the lawn with his
  lantern in his hand. He flashed it over a range of bushes, and as he did so
  he called gently for somebody to come out.</p>

  <p>There emerged a dark-eyed man with a curious frizzy head of red hair. He
  stood blinking viciously in the path of flame.</p>

  <p>"You know me?" said Von Wrangel. "You recognise my voice?"</p>

  <p>"Le Baron," came the reply, "trust you to find us out. But it is useless,
  quite useless. We are not going to fail this time. He is yonder. And we wait
  and wait and wait, but never, never do we lose sight of that villain
  again."</p>

  <p>"You are mistaken," Von Wrangel said. "I have got the right man away. You
  know the family; you have interested yourself in it as deeply as I have. That
  is not Stephen Gay yonder."</p>

  <p>"So! Then who is it?"</p>

  <p>"Surely a superfluous question. Have you forgotten the other man?"</p>

  <p>The red-headed man smote his forehead passionately.</p>

  <p>"A trick," he said. "Herr Baron, I cannot blame you&mdash;for the sake of
  the family. For the time I am beaten, I am in despair. Such a magnificent
  ruse Herr Baron, I wish you good-night. But there are other cards to play
  before the game is finished."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch38"
     name="ch38"></a>XXXVIII. &mdash; AFTER THE STORM.</h2>

  <p>There was sunshine on the lake at Stanmere; the old house lay bathed in
  it. The deer were knee-deep in the bracken, the woods behind the house were
  one upward sheet of green silence. To view the picture from the road or the
  lake it would be the last scene chosen for a tragedy or a mystery that
  darkened so many lives. It was Tennyson's "haunt of ancient peace;" one
  thought of "moaning doves in immemorial elms," and the "murmur of innumerable
  bees,"&mdash;anything but human passions and human weaknesses.</p>

  <p>And such it was a day or two after the strange events played there. The
  tourist passing by looked and admired, and perchance envied. Goss stood in
  the gateway bland and benign, the model of what a butler should be, the last
  man to connect with vulgar crime, and listened respectfully as my lady talked
  to him. There was a placid, contented look on Lady Stanmere's face, an
  expression of rest, that had not been there for years.</p>

  <p>Below the terrace in the rose garden Mary was walking. There was a strange
  feeling upon her as if she had been asleep for a long time and was not yet
  fully awake. She had long given up as hopeless any idea of solving the
  mystery that surrounded her, but once back at Stanmere again all that seemed
  to have faded away. Perhaps she would be left altogether at peace now; her
  father would fetch her away when the time came. As to the rest, nothing
  mattered. She was to remain where she was for the present, Lady Stanmere told
  her.</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere, in her turn, asked no questions. She was quite as much a
  puppet in the hands of fate as any of them. She had greatly feared that Mary
  might be taken away again, but she made no effort to retain the girl. She
  might have asked a few questions from her son Stephen, but he had disappeared
  as mysteriously as he had come. She expected nothing from him, not even love
  or gratitude. His life was in danger and he had gone. He might have been dead
  by this time for all Lady Stanmere knew to the contrary. But, nothing
  mattered now, so long as she had Mary with her. She would go away and take
  the girl with her; they could hide somewhere, and&mdash;</p>

  <p>But a letter from Martlett had saved all these desperate adventures.
  Martlett had to make a communication to her Ladyship which he was quite sure
  would meet with her approval. Circumstances had so fallen out that there was
  no reason why Miss Mary should not remain at Stanmere for the present; on the
  contrary, it was highly desirable that she should do so. There was nothing
  more than this&mdash;no details of any kind; but Lady Stanmere was
  satisfied.</p>

  <p>And Mary had no objection to make. She loved Stanmere; she had known in
  the old days, and she could find her way anywhere. It was good to be in a
  place where she could SEE, especially a place so beautiful as Stanmere. She
  was not to be cut off from congenial society, and Lady Stanmere had no
  objection to the presence of Molly and Dick.</p>

  <p>"I hope there will be no more changes and mysteries," Lady Stanmere said
  gently, as she and Mary walked up and down the rose garden together. "I shall
  be glad to have you always."</p>

  <p>"Not more than I shall be to stay," Mary smiled. "Only I shall hope to see
  my father sometimes, but he can never come to Stanmere."</p>

  <p>"I could never see why," Lady Stanmere said.</p>

  <p>"I never asked," Mary went on. "I was told that if ever I found myself
  here again I was to ask no questions and answer none. Some day all this
  mystery is going to be cleared; but I know that whatever happens, my father
  is a good man."</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere sighed gently. She had the bitterest reasons for knowing
  that Mary was wrong, but this simple faith was not to be disturbed.</p>

  <p>"He is a good father to you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, yes. A long time ago he used to be harsh and angry, and I was a
  little afraid of him, and when the prosperity came he seemed to change
  altogether. Then there was even something different in his voice, and when he
  has mentioned you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere hastened to change the subject; it was all very painful to
  her. She had not yet recovered from the shock of seeing Stephen again. She
  would have liked to have a walk after luncheon, but one of her nervous
  headaches prevented her.</p>

  <p>Mary would sit and talk to her, but Lady Stanmere would not hear of
  anything of the kind. She would lie down with the blinds drawn, and, besides,
  Molly Stevenson and her brother were coming over in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>"These heads of mine go as quickly as they come," she explained, and Mr.
  Martlett was coming down to dinner, and she must try and be ready to meet
  him.</p>

  <p>"Go out into the sunshine and wait for your friends," she said, "and be
  sure that you give them some tea. Now, run along and leave an old woman to
  her thoughts."</p>

  <p>Mary walked down by the rose garden and away by the lake. There came a
  step presently that brought a soft colour to her cheeks and made her heart
  beat a little faster, there was something suggestive about the flutter of her
  hands that the new-comer might have noticed.</p>

  <p>"Dick," she cried, "Dick, you have come alone!"</p>

  <p>"Because you can't hear Molly's footsteps," Dick laughed. "You are quite
  right; I left Molly just now in a beatific state of happiness. When we were
  having luncheon somebody came to the door. Molly cried out and rushed from
  the room. I rushed out to find her in the arms of a bronzed stranger with the
  regulation tawny moustache."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am so glad, Dick; Mr. Seymour has come home!"</p>

  <p>"Tom Seymour came quite unexpectedly. Molly had not heard for two mails,
  and she was getting anxious. Seymour's idea was to give her a pleasant
  surprise, and from the expression on Molly's face he seemed to have
  succeeded."</p>

  <p>Mary laughed, with a look of sympathy in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am so glad," she said. "I am very fond of Molly. It must be nice to
  have a lover, to feel that one man cares for you more than all the world. If
  I were not blind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What has that got to do with it?" Dick cried. "Why, he would love you all
  the more for that. Let me take you for a row on the lake. Molly will come
  over presently. It appears that Seymour has lost an uncle, or something of
  that kind, and his prospects are very bright in consequence. He says he is
  not going back to America any more."</p>

  <p>They drifted about on the surface of the lake for some time, and then they
  returned to the rose garden again. It was warm there and still, and fragrant
  with the countless blossoms. Mary turned so that the sunlight came full on
  her face.</p>

  <p>"I can almost see in a light like this," she said. "I wonder if ever I
  shall see again. If I could only see you at this moment, Dick!"</p>

  <p>Dick started guiltily. He was looking into that quiet beautiful face with
  something more than liking in his eyes. He was thinking of Von Wrangel at
  that moment.</p>

  <p>"I wish you could," he said. "I am not much to look at."</p>

  <p>"That is nonsense," Mary said firmly. "Molly says you very good-looking.
  You have a kind face, Dick. If ever you cared for a girl&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do care for a girl, Mary. I care for her very much, indeed."</p>

  <p>The words came spontaneously. They were quite wrong, but it was warm and
  secluded in the rose garden, and the scent of the blossoms was breast high.
  The young novelist was carried away by his feelings. Mary's very helplessness
  appealed to him strongly.</p>

  <p>"I hope she is a nice girl," Mary said; "a girl who is worthy of you. I
  should like to hear all about it. When you cannot see, such things interest
  you."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it does make a difference," Dick murmured. "I suppose&mdash;I
  mean there would be no reason why anybody with your trouble should not fall
  in love with a man. Of course his looks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Would not matter at all. I could judge of his actions and his voice, and
  the way that other people spoke of him. If he had a voice like yours,
  Dick!"</p>

  <p>"That would be a recommendation, of course," Dick said, gravely.</p>

  <p>Mary was looking at the sky in a quiet, speculative way.</p>

  <p>"But it would never do," she said. "It would be wrong to tie a man to a
  helpless creature like myself. If he were ambitious I should stand in his
  way. I should be a burden to him. I might try my best, but I should ever be a
  burden to him. If you cared for me, Dick&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mary, I do care for you. It was you I was thinking of just now. I am
  doing wrong I know, but I feel as if I must speak. You would be no burden to
  me, dearest. There is nothing I should like better in the world than to have
  you always by my side. The night I first saw you I fell in love on the spot.
  I knew that there was nobody else for me."</p>

  <p>"And you would sacrifice your life," Mary said, gently.</p>

  <p>"It would be no sacrifice at all," Dick cried, "but that is nothing. I
  love you, and I shall go on loving you always. I wish I could say more, but I
  could not think of any better words to express my feelings. Of course, I
  cannot expect you to care for me in the same way."</p>

  <p>"But I do, Dick. I didn't know it a few minutes ago, but I do."</p>

  <p>Her face was smiling, her eyes were dim with tears. She spoke in the
  simplest and most natural manner in the world. There seemed to be no reason
  why she should conceal her feelings. Dick loved her, which was the most
  wonderful and extraordinary thing in the world. The beautiful unseen hero of
  hers had picked her out of all the girls in the world as the one companion
  for him. Dick might have married anybody, of course. It never occurred to
  Mary that he was rather an ordinary type of young man with poor prospects,
  and those prospects entirely depending upon the caprice of the father of the
  girl he wished to marry. And he loved her and she loved him. Surely there was
  not such a romance as this since the world began!</p>

  <p>Somebody was speaking to Mary, and somebody's arm was round her waist. The
  touch thrilled her. The world was no longer empty. And somebody was asking
  Mary if she really and truly loved him. She turned her beautiful, pathetic
  face to his.</p>

  <p>"Kiss me Dick," she said, "and I will kiss you back again. Oh, my dear,
  you do not know how happy I am. To think that you could care for me!"</p>

  <p>Dick protested that this was one of the most natural things in the world.
  The mystery was that she cared for HIM. It was very warm and secluded there,
  and the scent of the blossoms subtly fragrant.</p>

  <p>"I almost feel as if I don't want to see your face," Mary said. "It seems
  more beautiful. And yet, for your sake, Dick, seeing you give so much and
  take so little&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused with the suspicion of a break in her voice. This was a
  temptation greater than Dick could stand. He drew Mary's head down on his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I am going to tell you something," he said, "something that I cannot keep
  to myself any longer. A saint would fail with that pleading face looking into
  his. You know our friend who calls himself Greigstein, the man who made
  experiments on your eyes. Do you know who he is?"</p>

  <p>Mary shook her head. Dick could feel her trembling.</p>

  <p>"No less a person than Von Wrangel," Dick went on. "The very man above all
  others that you wished to see. Mary, you are going to be cured. We have had
  it all out with Von Wrangel, and he has pledged his reputation on a
  cure."</p>

  <p>Mary said nothing for a moment. The creamy whiteness of her cheeks gave
  way to a deadly pallor; the blood mounted to her face again. She was
  dazed&mdash;overcome for a moment. She had not dared to hope for this. In her
  most sanguine moments she had put the thought aside.</p>

  <p>"I ought not to have told you so abruptly," Dick said.</p>

  <p>"It did not matter," Mary whispered. "I was a little overcome, but I am
  all right now, Dick. Is it really possible that I am going to see again? The
  mere suggestion tells me all that I have lost; and I am going to be worthy of
  your love after all."</p>

  <p>Her head fell on Dick's shoulder again, her face was hidden so that Dick
  alone was in full view of Lady Stanmere standing there in the archway leading
  to the garden. The grey figure stood motionless, the grey eyes were
  steady&mdash;whether with disappointment or anger Dick could not say; and
  Mary was crying quietly on his breast with only one thought uppermost in her
  mind.</p>

  <p>She was going to see again and be worthy of this gracious lover.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch39"
     name="ch39"></a>XXXIX. &mdash; "IS THIS THING TRUE?"</h2>

  <p>A small party had gathered about the tea-table in Stanmere drawing-room.
  There was Molly, beaming with happiness, and looking shyly at a bronzed young
  man with a dark moustache and an expression on his face little less beatific
  than Molly's. Mary was quiet and thoughtful, with a look of perfect content
  in her eyes. Lady Stanmere was gentle and gracious, and Dick woefully ill at
  ease.</p>

  <p>So far as Lady Stanmere's manner went, she might have been in blissful
  ignorance of that pretty little scene in the rose garden. Her headache had
  entirely gone; she was listening to some of Tom Seymour's American adventures
  with an air of interest. Dick was the only unhappy one of the party. Not that
  he was in the least ashamed of himself. In any case, Lady Stanmere must know
  in time, but Dick would have greatly preferred to have told her in his own
  way.</p>

  <p>"I am going to take a turn on the terrace," Lady Stanmere said, presently.
  She removed a crumb from her grey silk dress carefully. "I am a little tired
  to-day, and so I need an arm to lean on. Dick, will you give me your arm for
  a few minutes?"</p>

  <p>Dick responded that it would be a pleasure. If her were going to catch it
  he would like to get it over at once. There was a suspicion of colour on his
  face.</p>

  <p>"Delighted," he murmured. "Shall I get a wrap for you?"</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere thought there was no necessity&mdash;she liked this kind of
  weather. Did Dick think that it was likely to last? And what a modest, manly
  young man Seymour was! Dick responded mechanically. He wondered when the
  storm was coming.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," Lady Stanmere said presently. "I am waiting for you to
  speak."</p>

  <p>"And I was waiting for you to scold me," Dick said, "I throw myself
  entirely on your mercy, Lady Stanmere. It was a very wrong thing to do, but I
  have loved Mary ever since I first met her. And when I found that she cared
  for me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know, I know. I have been young myself, Dick. For my part, I can't see
  that there is so very much the matter. If I were to choose a husband for
  Mary, I should like one something after your style, Dick. And the fact that
  the poor girl is blind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She may not remain so," Dick said, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"So I gathered from what you were saying to the child," Lady Stanmere
  said, calmly. "It is one of my virtues or my misfortunes that I have very
  good ears. I heard what you said about Von Wrangel. Did he really go so far
  as to express a confident opinion?"</p>

  <p>Dick explained. Lady Stanmere listened gravely.</p>

  <p>"It is very strange," she said presently, "but Von Wrangel never occurred
  to me. True, he was not available at a time when&mdash;but we need not go
  into that. Of course, the whole thing has come as a great surprise to me. It
  would be a very happy day for me if Mary would once more be like the rest of
  us. I must get you to bring Von Wrangel to me."</p>

  <p>Dick promised eagerly enough. He had very little else to think of for the
  moment. His attendance had been dispensed with at the Record office for the
  present, on the understanding that he was to come up at any time if his
  services were needed. He had carried out his last undertaking successfully,
  and this was a kind of reward for his pains.</p>

  <p>"I will send Von Wrangel to you with pleasure," he said. "I ought not to
  have said anything to Mary, but when she looked at me in that pathetic way I
  really couldn't. . . . . . I know I ought not to have said anything to her at
  all. She is far above me. She is rich, or will be, and she has a father
  who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of that I know nothing," Lady Stanmere said, a little coldly. "I am as
  much in the dark as you are. But of one thing I am certain&mdash;any good
  honest man is a fit mate for the daughter of Mary's father. And if I have any
  influence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere paused and began to talk of other matters. She had grown
  cold and hard for the moment. Evidently she was thinking only of Mary and her
  interests. But why did she speak thus of Mary's father, Dick wondered. He was
  a man evidently respected, and yet he might have been a felon from the way
  that Lady Stanmere referred to him.</p>

  <p>"Your mother was one of my dearest friends," Lady Stanmere went on, after
  a long pause. "I knew you as a child, and now I meet you as a young man. It
  seems to me that Mary has made her own choice. There may be money, as you
  say, and there may be not. I am a mere puppet in these matters; I do not know
  how I stand myself. Mr. Martlett comes and he goes, and there is an end of
  it. But if ever I have anything to leave, that little will be Mary's. You are
  young and strong and resolute, Dick, and you will get on. I am rather glad
  that you are poor still, because you can't take Mary away from me for a long
  time. And that is the last word I have to say."</p>

  <p>Dick went back to the house presently with a feeling that he had got off
  pretty cheaply. All the same the sense of mystery was still there. The more
  Dick thought of it the more puzzled he was. But that would no doubt solve
  itself in time, and he flattered himself that he had made himself almost
  necessary to the man who could make or mar his happiness.</p>

  <p>In the drawing-room the group was added to by the presence of Mr.
  Martlett. He looked as rusty and as mysterious as usual, his clothes were
  dingy and his linen as clean as ever. He was laughing in his dry, silent
  fashion at some anecdote he had heard from Seymour. Presently, when the young
  people had drifted out into the sunshine again, he crossed over and took a
  seat by Lady Stanmere. He rubbed his dry hands together.</p>

  <p>"Lady Stanmere, I have made a discovery," he said.</p>

  <p>"We live in an atmosphere of them," Lady Stanmere replied. "Let us hope
  that it is one that will throw a little light in the darkness."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, it tends to confuse matters," Martlett said. "I have
  found out that Master Dick and Miss Mary are in love with one another."</p>

  <p>"Indeed. Do you care for that kind of romance?"</p>

  <p>"As a student of human nature, yes. Scraps of knowledge like this are
  always useful to us lawyers. I am sure they are in love with one
  another."</p>

  <p>"Under the circumstances it is quite natural."</p>

  <p>Martlett shot a shrewd sly glance at his companion.</p>

  <p>"And they have found it out," he went on. "They have come to an
  understanding, my lady. And you know it as well as I do myself."</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere confessed that she was not in ignorance of the fact. But she
  had only recently made the discovery. She dropped her knitting silk, which
  Martlett picked up and handed to her with a grave courtesy that was all his
  own.</p>

  <p>"And what do you propose to do about the matter," Martlett asked.</p>

  <p>"I propose to do nothing," Lady Stanmere said coldly. "I suppose Mary will
  marry some day, and Dick Stevenson is really a very fine young fellow. In any
  case, I am quite sure that my advice would not be heeded. I am a mere
  figure-head here; you are good enough to tell me just as much as you please
  and no more. Really, I do not intend to interfere."</p>

  <p>Martlett scraped his dry chin, thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"A blind wife would be a terrible incumbus to an ambitious young man," he
  said. "It is all very well at first when the bloom of the romance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mary will not be blind much longer, Mr. Martlett."</p>

  <p>The lawyer started. It was not often that he allowed himself to betray
  surprise; but this time he was taken off his guard. He was just a little
  annoyed with himself, too.</p>

  <p>"I should like to hear more of this," he said.</p>

  <p>"It is quite simple," Lady Stanmere replied. "Von Wrangel has seen Mary,
  and he has given it as his decided opinion that an operation will be
  successful. And as you know Von Wrangel as well as I know him myself, I have
  no doubt he will tell you the same thing."</p>

  <p>Martlett had no more to say on the point. He had come down to talk
  business of the estate. He had quite intended to stop the night there, but
  there was no necessity now. If he could have an early chop he had far rather
  get back to town again. His manner was a little hurried, and he was not quite
  so cold and watchful as usual.</p>

  <p>It was still comparatively early when the lawyer reached London again. He
  did not go back to his chambers in Lincoln's Inn, but walked to Pant street,
  where he was so fortunate as to find Von Wrangel at home. The latter was
  trimming his lantern and had his specimen cases all about him.</p>

  <p>"Ah, my mysterious friend," he cried. "Come and look at this chap. He is a
  moth. He lives on the trunks of decayed trees. Doesn't he look dry and
  leathery, and hasn't he got a cunning eye? I was going to call him the
  Martlett moth. Look at his eye."</p>

  <p>"Put that rubbish away," Martlett said, calmly. "I have been to Stanmere.
  Lady Stanmere tells me that you can restore Miss Mary's eye-sight."</p>

  <p>"So she's got to hear of that," Von Wrangel exclaimed. "On the whole, I
  would have preferred it to remain a secret for the present. I was going to
  operate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Without the permission of the girl's natural guardian?"</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel glanced at the speaker for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are a lawyer," he said. "I suppose you would make affidavits and
  file notices and look up all kinds of precedents and have counsel's opinion
  and all the rest of it. Mummy, with a piece of dry leather in place of a
  heart, what are you talking about? Wouldn't everybody be GLAD for that poor
  girl to get her eye-sight back? And do you suppose that I, Von Wrangel, am
  going to fail? Bah, you make me ill."</p>

  <p>Martlett shrugged his shoulders. All this tirade affected him not at
  all.</p>

  <p>"You propose to dispense with that formality?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I propose to do as I like," Von Wrangel said. "Go out, you old mummy. Go
  away, or I'll get my moth to bite you. Allons!"</p>

  <p>Martlett departed quite calmly and unruffled. "There's a nice thing," he
  muttered. "To pose as a cruel ruffian who desires to keep a poor girl in the
  dark for the sake of. . . . . And am I as heartless as Von Wrangel says? All
  the same, this is a pretty kettle of fish altogether."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch40"
     name="ch40"></a>XL. &mdash; "NOT YET."</h2>

  <p>A decorous silence reigned in The Record office, for the hour of clanking
  presses was not yet. There were the green shades throwing little pools of
  light upon the tables where a dozen or so of pale-faced men worked
  feverishly. Here was one scoring rapidly with the pencil, another writing
  furiously, whilst a third was doing desperate things with a whole basketful
  of telegrams. The orderly hurry of it all seemed to please Spencer as he
  moved through the building on his way to his own room.</p>

  <p>He looked straight, well set up, and pleased with himself this evening.
  The haggard look had gone from his eyes, his head was erect with the carriage
  of a man who not only dares great things, but generally accomplishes
  them.</p>

  <p>The shades were on the tables in his own room, a pile of accounts with a
  parchment covered bank book or two gave a suggestion of wealth and
  importance. For a long time Spencer sat there pondering over his columns of
  figures. His mind was perfectly clear now, his brain was working rapidly.</p>

  <p>"I fancy that will do," he muttered. "Another three months, and the thing
  will be successfully accomplished. But forty thousand pounds is a lot of
  money, and matters of this kind so easily go astray. If I only dared to show
  myself a little more freely, if I could be seen in the city the thing would
  be a certainty. And why not? One man is out of the way, and the other dare
  not show his face for fear of the police. I must risk it."</p>

  <p>All the same, Spencer started slightly as a clerk came in with a message
  to the effect that there was a gentleman waiting down below to see the head
  of the firm. His nerves were not yet quite in such good order as he
  supposed.</p>

  <p>"It's Mr. Martlett, sir," the clerk said. "I thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why did you not say so before?" Spencer demanded, annoyed to find himself
  so easily disturbed. The room was so quiet and soothing. "Show him up at
  once."</p>

  <p>Martlett came in in his own quiet manner. For once in a way he was in
  evening dress. He had been evidently dining somewhere and had left early, for
  it was barely nine o'clock. He drew up a chair to the table and took a pinch
  of snuff.</p>

  <p>"You wanted to see me?" he said, tentatively. "It was the matter of that
  last mortgage."</p>

  <p>"And the one that has caused me more trouble than all the others put
  together. If we can manage to pay that off, Martlett, my task will be
  accomplished. I have raised every penny I can on the paper and my property
  elsewhere; I have pinched and scraped. Of course 'The Record' is a fine
  income in itself, and worth a lot of money to sell but I don't want to do
  that. What have you done in the matter?"</p>

  <p>Martlett proceeded to explain. He had found a certain flaw in the
  signature to one of the old mortgages which had given the other side food for
  serious reflection.</p>

  <p>"Of course they would like to foreclose now," he said. "They would make
  thousands by so doing. But if we fight them we gain time, and by the end of
  six months you will be in a position to find the money. It would be a pity to
  spoil it all now."</p>

  <p>"A pity!" Spencer cried. "I have sunk half a million. I have built my
  scheme step by step; I have watched it expand before my eyes. It has been my
  penance, my life's atonement. And if I were to lose it now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused and wiped his face, for he was agitated and the room was warm.
  There was a wistful expression in his eyes, his lips were twitching. It was
  some little time before he spoke again. Martlett took snuff with great
  relish.</p>

  <p>"We are not going to fail," he said. "If necessary, we will fight. Then
  there will be an order for the verification of signatures, and shall gain the
  time we require. Put yourself in the witness box for ten minutes and the
  thing is settled."</p>

  <p>A peculiar spasm passed over Spencer's face. "I must," he said
  desperately. "I must if necessary. To-night I could face it; with those
  figures before me I could dare anything. If I were sure as to those two
  men."</p>

  <p>"You are sure!" Martlett rasped out. "Thanks to Von Wrangel, you are
  certain. If you had gone a little more slowly into this business, we need not
  have sailed quite so close to the wind. Give me your instructions to act as I
  please over that unattested signature, and the thing is safe. I may have to
  call you as a witness."</p>

  <p>"Anything you like," Spencer said. "I&mdash;I must."</p>

  <p>He flung out his hands like a man who is prepared for anything. Long after
  Martlett had taken himself off with his snuff-box he sat staring with the
  mass of papers before him. He felt strung up and reckless enough for anything
  now, but would his nerves be as steady and as free in the morning? Could he
  go out into the street and meet one of two faces, and then carry on his
  resolution? A few years before such a thing might have been possible, but not
  now.</p>

  <p>All being well, a few months hence nothing mattered. He would be able to
  speak then and clear himself in the eyes of those whose good opinion he
  valued. He had committed one crime, and, like many people in the same
  position, he had been forced to to commit another to hide the first.</p>

  <p>And Martlett the immaculate Martlett, had suggested it.</p>

  <p>Spencer was relieved and glad to find himself no longer alone. Dick
  Stevenson had come with head erect and eye shining. There was envy as well as
  admiration in Spencer's glance. He would have given up everything and
  ventured anything to be young and strong like that again. His smile for the
  young man was quite fatherly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing wrong this time?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, indeed, sir," Dick said joyously; "quite to the contrary. I had to
  run up for something, and I thought I would come and let you know."</p>

  <p>Spencer smiled again. Dick found himself wondering whether Mr. Spencer
  would be quite so amiable if he knew all that had happened. As a matter of
  fact Dick had come on purpose to tell him.</p>

  <p>It was quite impossible for his engagement to Mary to be kept a secret. He
  grew a little more grave as the full weight of his responsibility came upon
  him.</p>

  <p>"I should like to have a little talk with you, sir," he said. "I dare say
  I have done wrong, but really I could not help it. But I I think you ought to
  know."</p>

  <p>Spencer motioned him to a chair. There was something frank and manly about
  Dick that made most people like him. His face was red, but he looked steadily
  at his companion.</p>

  <p>"You see, I met your daughter under peculiar circumstances," he went on;
  "and from the very first we were drawn together. They say pity is akin to
  love. It seemed so strange that one so beautiful and with such beautiful eyes
  should be blind. I pictured what she might be if you&mdash;you were dead. And
  I felt that I should like nothing better than to be her protector, and she
  likes me."</p>

  <p>"I am not in the least surprised at that," Mr. Spencer said,
  cordially.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, that is very good of you, sir, and it gives me courage to
  proceed. We saw a great deal of one another, and I had some insight into your
  secret&mdash;not of my own seeking. And gradually it came about&mdash;well,
  sir, I let Mary know that I loved her, and I was surprised that she loved me
  in return. I daresay it was wrong, for Mary will be rich and I shall be very
  poor; and if you are very angry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dick stopped breathless and confused. He had poured out his confession
  without stopping to think. He looked up almost fearfully at the man to whom
  he owed so much. But there was not the least suggestion of anger on Spencer's
  face.</p>

  <p>"So it has come to this," he said. "It is very honorable of you to tell
  me; as a matter of fact, Mary will not be rich at all."</p>

  <p>"So much the better, sir," Dick said boldly.</p>

  <p>"Rash boy! Married happiness is not rendered any the less blissful because
  of money. Dick, you are a very ambitious young man."</p>

  <p>"Or a very conceited one, sir," Dick said. "I don't quite know which."</p>

  <p>"No, no; you have got the right stuff in you; and I like that square jaw
  of yours. But you have not sufficiently reflected over this business. There
  are reasons which you may know some day, that prevent my interfering with
  Mary in her choice of a husband. I feel quite sure she has chosen well; but
  have you thought what an incubus a blind wife may be?"</p>

  <p>"I am ready to face that," Dick said boldly. His head was erect and his
  eyes shining now. "I asked Mary to be my wife with the fact before me. But
  she is not going to be blind."</p>

  <p>"She is not going to be?&mdash;What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean that Mary is going to see," Dick cried. "We have found the very
  man we most desired to see. He used to call himself Greigstein in the old
  Pant-street days, but I know him now as Von Wrangel. He has made a complete
  examination of Mary's eyes, and he says she will see. Lady Stanmere knows
  this too. It is the best news one man ever brought to another."</p>

  <p>If it were so, then Spencer was most carefully disguising his feelings.
  There was no smile on his face, only a look of amazement and it might be a
  suggestion of fear. He ought to have been wildly, extravagantly,
  enthusiastically glad. As it was, he sat in his chair, listening to Dick,
  with a strange, cold, hard look on his face.</p>

  <p>"You mean in the course of a long time," he said.</p>

  <p>"Indeed I don't, sir," Dick went on, without noticing his companion's
  expression. "Von Wrangel has no doubts on the matter at all. He says that
  within a week Mary will see as well as you or I. He is going to operate at
  once."</p>

  <p>"He is going to operate at once! When?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow night. He prefers night time because he uses strong electric
  light. And all the plant is ready at hand at Stanmere. Lady Stanmere
  telegraphed him to come down to-morrow. It is a terribly anxious time."</p>

  <p>"I forbid the whole thing altogether."</p>

  <p>A bucket of ice-cold water might have been suddenly poured over Dick by
  the way he started and shivered. The words were harsh and hard and
  grating.</p>

  <p>"Forbid it, sir!" he gasped. "I&mdash;I don't understand. Do you actually
  mean to say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My words were plain enough. Until I am thoroughly satisfied that. . . .
  Good Heavens! It will upset all my plans. . . I shall be a ruined man. . . .
  And this is how one crime leads to another. Put it off, my boy; get it
  postponed for a month, two months, and I will give you ten thousand pounds.
  I'll give you a partnership in the the paper. Manage it for me, only manage
  it. . ."</p>

  <p>Spencer's voice had sunk to a whisper, his eyes were gleaming. A strange,
  cunning expression had come over his face. The man was completely
  transformed.</p>

  <p>"This is an outrage," Dick exclaimed. "There is something wrong&mdash;your
  brain has suddenly given way. Two or three months! To deprive any creature of
  God's greatest blessing for one moment when the skill of a man can restore
  it! Why, if you suggested the temporary blinding of the vilest criminal on
  earth for three months the whole nation would rise up against you. And Mary!
  You are mad."</p>

  <p>There was a thrill of horror in Dick's voice, he recoiled white and
  trembling before the man opposite. The stinging speech, the utter loathing
  and contempt, seemed to bring Spencer back to himself again.</p>

  <p>"You don't know," he said hoarsely; "you can't tell how I am placed. And
  it has been so long that a little longer . . . and if the poor girl does not
  know."</p>

  <p>"She does know," Dick said, sternly; "I told her. When she turned her face
  to mine and longed for sight I told her. The coldest and most callous man
  would have done so. And now you deliberately try and bribe me to&mdash;oh,
  you must be mad, mad!"</p>

  <p>The last words rang through the room. The chief of 'The Record' actually
  cowered before the youngest and most recent member of his staff. He essayed
  to say something, but words failed him. He would have explained it all away,
  but he could not.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am mad," he said. "It comes on me suddenly. Perhaps your news has
  been too much for me. I am not the man I was. But it is dreadful, horrible.
  Go and leave me."</p>

  <p>Without another word Dick turned and left the room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch41"
     name="ch41"></a>XLI. &mdash; VON WRANGEL CAPTURES ANOTHER SPECIMEN.</h2>

  <p>About the same time of night Von Wrangel, in his shirt sleeves, was busy
  arranging his specimens in the little bed-sitting-room in Pant-street. He was
  on the best of terms with himself, for he had lately taken two fresh
  specimens, and in addition he had just had a telegram from Lady Stanmere
  asking him to go down to-morrow to perform Mary's operation. The telegram lay
  on the table, and Von Wrangel had used it to mix some precipitate powder
  on.</p>

  <p>"This time to-morrow and that will be over," he said, sotto voce. "Under
  ordinary circumstances it would lead to fresh complications. But the tiger
  moth is hiding, and he can do no harm for the present, if the tiger moth had
  not been a fool he would have been flitting to a foreign shore by this time.
  I must find out and give him another warning. All the trouble I took at
  Stanmere the other night is not to be wasted; I spoil sport no longer. Come
  in."</p>

  <p>The door opened and a little twisted man came in. He looked like one who
  had been badly broken up at some time in a railway accident&mdash;he had a
  big hump, and one shoulder was higher than the other. There was a long, bold
  red scar across his white face, but his eyes were wonderfully steady, and
  there was a certain suggestion of power about his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"So you are here, Louis," Von Wrangel said. "You got my message?"</p>

  <p>"I got the letter, Baron," Louis said in a husky whisper. His voice seemed
  as queer as his body. "And all day I have been looking for your man. I found
  him this morning, but he did not see me. The bird is too shy to come here, so
  I limed a twig for him. Behold, in the evening paper that they affect I put
  an advertisement purporting to come from Milano. At nine o'clock to-night
  Hengel will be under the fourth elm tree on the walk by Regent's Park,
  nearest the Zoo. And if you happened to be there hunting butterflies you
  might see him."</p>

  <p>The little man chuckled and winked one flaming red eye. Von Wrangel
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"That was well done," he said, "especially as Hengel fancies that nobody
  but myself and Milano knows him to be in England. I will go and prospect for
  a new specimen presently. Regent's Park is not closed to me, indeed it is not
  closed to anybody who possesses the necessary agility to climb a railing. Ah,
  they are wise people these London police."</p>

  <p>"The tiger moth has not flown away, Baron?"</p>

  <p>"The tiger moth is a fool. He had his money, but he must needs stay for
  another night in London. Then he drinks too much, he plays too high, and his
  money is gone. He is hiding somewhere now, with his wings singed. I shall
  force Hengel to tell me where he is, so that I can repair those wings, for
  between ourselves, Louis, the tiger moth must be got away for a time."</p>

  <p>"Let him perish," Louis grunted, with a sombre flash of the red eye.</p>

  <p>"For the sake of the family which has suffered so much at my hands, I
  cannot. Go away, my dear Louis, and do not tempt me. There is a busy time
  ahead."</p>

  <p>Louis took his queer twisted body away as silently as he had come. The
  easy smile faded from Von Wrangel's face; he had the air of one who has
  serious work before him. A little time after, and he was walking away in a
  north-west direction with a little box strapped to his back and a lantern in
  his hand. Regent's Park had been a happy hunting-ground for him for a long
  while, and, though the gates were closed and the police vigilant, Von Wrangel
  had no difficulty in getting access to the park. As a character he was well
  known to the police, who looked upon him as a harmless lunatic, who had
  somehow or other contrived to find a friend at court.</p>

  <p>"You'll have it all to yourself to-night, sir," the policeman in the park
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"Ah, so you think," Von Wrangel replied. "I tell you I see some queer
  specimens in these parks. If they were wise they would be thrown open all day
  and night and patrolled by the police. You think yonder place is empty! Bah!
  so empty that I always carry this."</p>

  <p>He touched his hip pocket significantly. A moment later his lamp was
  flashing inside and he had given himself entirely up to the pursuit of his
  favourite hobby. He had plenty of time before it became necessary to work his
  way to the rendezvous.</p>

  <p>He hunted along steadily for half-an-hour, placing more than one specimen
  in his box and enjoying himself immensely. He did not look in the least like
  a man who is out on a dangerous errand. He came presently to his destination;
  he fastened his box securely. From behind the line of light thrown by the
  brilliant lantern he looked keenly and searchingly. A round object to the
  left of one of the trees caught his attention. He fixed the white rays upon
  it.</p>

  <p>"Ah," he said. "There is the specimen I need. It is white, with a deep,
  fiery red hear, and it has long feelers. They reach from London to Berlin,
  and from Vienna to St. Petersburg. My moth is rarely seen, but he is the
  cause of great activity in others. The moth I see before me is only caught by
  stratagem. It has a great weakness for newspaper advertisements."</p>

  <p>All this in a gay, rather loud voice, whilst the round object at the end
  of the line of light shuffled.</p>

  <p>"I'll come out, Baron," a hoarse voice said. "In one way you are too
  clever for me. But you will not baffle me in the end. If I fail there are
  others."</p>

  <p>"Come out and sit here in the light," Von Wrangel said, coolly.</p>

  <p>The man with the fiery red hair emerged. He did not look in the least like
  a dangerous assassin. He might have been a better-class artisan, a workman
  who is fond of books. There are scores like him to be seen at any
  manufacturing town in Europe. He was just a little shy and retiring, and the
  eyes that were turned upon Von Wrangel were like those of a dog.</p>

  <p>Yet the man was a fanatic. He had his creed, and stuck to it like a Hindoo
  might. He was not in the least blood-thirsty, but he had what he considered a
  duty to perform, and he would see it through to the end, though it cost him
  his own life to do so.</p>

  <p>"What do you want, Baron," he asked.</p>

  <p>"You know quite well what I want," Von Wrangel said. "I lured you here to
  meet me, knowing well that there was no other way. Hengel, you owe me
  something."</p>

  <p>"I owe you everything, Baron. But for you I should have been tortured in
  gaol. You saved me from that. There is nothing I would not do for you."</p>

  <p>"Quite wrong. There is one thing you would not do for me."</p>

  <p>"Break my oath&mdash;no. I could not do that. There is not one of us who
  would do that for anybody. You spoilt our game at Stanmere because you, too,
  have sworn to do so. I have no feeling in the matter at all; I was only here
  to do my duty. I did not come when you tracked me the other night because
  sooner or later that man must die."</p>

  <p>"And if I put the police on your track, and say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What could you say?" Hengel said, with a shrug of his shoulders. "You
  could prove nothing. For a time the police would lock us up and then we
  should be released. Meanwhile, other men whom you know not would take up the
  mission. And you would fight better, Baron, with me. Better the devil you
  know than the devil you don't know, Herr Baron."</p>

  <p>"Spoken like a wise man," Von Wrangel said. "I should be bringing about
  the very calamity that I am doing my best to avoid. I beat you the other
  night, but the tiger moth is a fool. He did not go away as I told him to
  do."</p>

  <p>"What matters? We are certain to find him."</p>

  <p>"Ah, well, you gave me a proverb just now, and I will give you another:
  'He who fights and runs away, lives to fight another day'. Thus the tiger
  moth. You are going to tell me where he is, Hengel, so that I can give him
  funds and a further warning."</p>

  <p>The he man with the red head smiled.</p>

  <p>"That is not the game," he said. "But so sure are we, that I don't mind
  doing that, especially as you have taken all the trouble for nothing. Only a
  little time ago I was in the locality of the house where you have your
  chambers."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel smiled. He thought of Dick Swiveller and his rooms, where the
  mind might pass at pleasure through numerous and spacious saloons. He could
  not quite imagine what the man with the red hair was driving at.</p>

  <p>"And yet did not favour me with a call," he said.</p>

  <p>"Business before pleasure," Hengel said, grimly. "I was very near there,
  as I have been many times before. It was only a child looking in a shop
  window that stayed my hand. But I am not impatient; I know that the time will
  come."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel nodded. He knew perfectly well what the other meant.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said; "here is my collecting-box. I am hunting the tiger
  moth. Not that I love the creature, but for the sake of others. He is not
  here, but you know perfectly well where he is."</p>

  <p>"As you say, I know perfectly well where he is, Baron."</p>

  <p>"And you seem so sure of your ground. Therefore, as you are under such
  obligation to me, you are going to tell me where to find the tiger moth. For
  the sake of others whom I respect and love and admire, I am going to do my
  best to get the tiger moth out of the way. Come, let me know. Wipe out one of
  those obligations."</p>

  <p>The man with the red hair was laughing quietly. Something seemed to amuse
  him. He stammered some apology as he saw the anger kindling in Von Wrangel's
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"You take a great stick to kill so small a fly," he said. "All this pretty
  strategy is wasted. But you could not know that, and you have done very well
  indeed. Only if you had stopped at home and smoked your cigarette, you would
  have done still better. In any case, Baron, I would have given you the
  desired information, because it can make no difference in the long run.
  Still, I tell you frankly, because I do no violence to my orders. At the
  present moment the tiger moth is sitting waiting for you in your rooms in
  Pant-street."</p>

  <p>A cry of astonishment came from Von Wrangel.</p>

  <p>"You mean to say that you saw him enter?" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Even so. Five minutes after you had gone. If I had known your errand, I
  would have taken the liberty of saving you all this trouble."</p>

  <p>But Von Wrangel heard nothing of the other's politeness. He dropped his
  lantern and specimen case, and started to race across the park as fast as his
  legs could carry him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch42"
     name="ch42"></a>XLII. &mdash; ONE WAY OUT.</h2>

  <p>Von Wrangel ran on and on till the quietude of Regent's Park gave way to
  the well-lighted streets, and sundry policemen began to regard him with
  suspicion. There were other reasons why the German pulled up, not entirely
  unconnected with the fact that increasing years are not compatible with
  long-distance running.</p>

  <p>A deep feeling of anger, too, filled Von Wrangel. There were vast
  interests at stake here, and according to all calculations Stephen Gay should
  have been out of England by this time. He was going to have a bad time of it
  presently.</p>

  <p>But he had to be removed beyond reach of danger first. The mysterious
  power that was behind those who had sworn to have the traitor's life was not
  underrated by Von Wrangel. They were so calm, so certain, so assured of their
  ground. He had known them to wait patiently for years before they struck. He
  had fought hard in his time against this curse to progress and liberty, and
  he had given it up in vain.</p>

  <p>Still there was always a chance. The chance lay in getting Stephen Gay
  away from Pant-street. The road might be apparently empty of spies, but the
  seeing eye would be there; and as sure as Gay left Pant-street in the
  ordinary way he was a lost man.</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel came to a pause in Tottenham Court road. He stepped and looked
  into a pawnbroker's window to return breath and recover his scattered
  thoughts. Two flashing electric lights gleamed upon a miscellaneous
  collection of portable property that would have rejoiced the heart of Mr.
  Wemmick.</p>

  <p>Here was a way out. Two or three hansom cabs creeping along the kerb were
  allowed to pass before Von Wrangel made his choice. Here was a cab-man who
  evidently drank, and consequently was none too prosperous and possibly none
  too scrupulous either. As he pulled up Von Wrangel mounted the step.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to earn five pounds?" he asked, crisply.</p>

  <p>The man with the cunning eyes nodded. It was fairly evident that the sum
  in question would purchase all the morality and conscience that remained to
  him.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing wrong," Von Wrangel went on. "You have only to do as you
  are told. And I may want the loan of your cab for a few minutes. Stay where
  you are."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel dived into the pawnbroker's, to return in a few minutes
  followed by an assistant who carried a battered old portmanteau that his
  customer had just purchased. This being hauled on to the cab, Von Wrangel
  gave the direction of Pant-street. Once arrived there, the cab-man had orders
  to stay for a period that Von Wrangel calculated would not be more than
  twenty minutes altogether.</p>

  <p>"I'll leave the portmanteau," he said. "I'll tell you what the next thing
  is. You are going to make money to-night easier than you have ever done in
  your life."</p>

  <p>The cab-man nodded. Up to now there had been nothing calculated to bring
  about an endorsement of his license, and that was what he had to fear. Von
  Wrangel went up the stairs two steps at a time and burst into the room.</p>

  <p>Hengel had not deceived him. Stephen Gay was there. At the sound of
  footsteps he had snatched up the poker and stood behind the table prepared to
  defend his life. All the swaggering insolence had gone from his face, the
  cheeks were mottled and soddened, a fact all the more prominent because of
  his trembling fear. He was a dead pasty white, his red eyes were full of
  terror.</p>

  <p>"Get back," he cried. "You blood-thirsty ruffian, I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He dropped the poker and broke into a quavering laugh. Von Wrangel watched
  the twitching of his fingers with disgust. Here was a man whose nerves were
  entirely wrecked by the one thing beyond fear. There was a faint suggestion
  of spirits in the room. Gay laughed again and his eyes went down to the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"What," Von Wrangel demanded sternly, "what are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>Gay made no reply for the moment. He was trembling from head to foot with
  the reaction of his sudden fright. Von Wrangel glanced round the room
  searchingly. But apparently everything was just as he had left it, even to
  Lady Stanmere's telegram, with the precipitate powder still strewn upon it.
  It was impossible to suspect that Gay was here for any other reason than
  safety. The man was too horribly frightened to think of anything else.</p>

  <p>"If you have such a thing as a drop of brandy," Gay suggested.</p>

  <p>"Not a drop," Von Wrangel cried. "You are not sober now. You have been
  drinking heavily. I wouldn't have a brain and body like yours at this moment
  for all the money in the universe. Let me feel your pulse. Your nerves are
  all red-hot wires."</p>

  <p>He drew down an eyelid of Gay's and examined the quickly expanding
  pupil.</p>

  <p>"My friend, you are very nearly on the verge of delirium tremens," he said
  gravely. "It is hard to believe that you are the same man I piloted out of
  danger not so long ago. Where is all the money you had then?"</p>

  <p>"Gone," Gay said sullenly. "All spent. I got to London quite safely. Then
  I decided to have one more royal night of it before I left London. I must
  have been mad, Von Wrangel. I began to drink and then I lost my head. And I
  got in some queer sort of gambling house. It's strange how a man of my
  temperament always drifts to this kind of place."</p>

  <p>He maundered on and wept in a sudden fit of self-pity. Von Wrangel shook
  him passionately.</p>

  <p>"None of that," he said, sternly. "I'll make you some coffee. How did you
  get here?"</p>

  <p>"They found me out. I had a marvellous escape. The third time I had to
  jump into the Thames. Perhaps it was a pity that I ever came out again."</p>

  <p>"Politeness forbids me to contradict you," Von Wrangel said, acidly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you can sneer. Then I had no more money to get anything, and my
  nerves gave out. The dogs were following me all the time. The mere presence
  of a child saved me just now when I was sitting in a state of collapse on a
  doorstep. I recollected the fact that I had been here before, and what is
  more to the point, I recollected the address. I tell you it was a near
  thing."</p>

  <p>He broke down, and a fit of trembling came over him again. Von Wrangel
  brewed some coffee over a spirit lamp, and Gay drank greedily. A little color
  began to creep into his soddened face.</p>

  <p>"Get me out of this," he said&mdash;"get me out this. I've got a little
  work to do to-morrow evening, and then I swear to you I will leave
  England."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel glanced uneasily at the telegram on the table. But Gay's
  dilated gaze had never for an instant turned in that direction.</p>

  <p>"Get me out of this," Gay went on. "You've brains and imagination. Think!
  Those people are waiting for me outside. Only get me away."</p>

  <p>"There is a back door to the house," Von Wrangel said, meaningly.</p>

  <p>"What's the good of that? Do you suppose those brigands don't know
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Very likely they do. When I came here for reasons of my own I was
  influenced in my choice of these desirable apartments by the presence of a
  back entrance. But you are not going that way. The other man disappears in
  that direction, and you go off in state. Do you think that you could manage
  to drive a hansom cab?"</p>

  <p>Gay nodded. Country born and county bred, he knew all about a horse.
  Everybody who had ever had a pair of reins in his hand might drive a cab,
  especially in quiet streets at this time of night. He was eager to have the
  chance.</p>

  <p>"Very well," Von Wrangel said. "You shall have your cab and £10 to boot.
  When you get away, and can write to me in safety, I will see that you have
  more. After then I wash my hands of you. If you get into another scrape you
  must find your own way out of it."</p>

  <p>Gay gurgled something that sounded like gratitude. He was not going to be
  a fool any more. Von Wrangel stepped out of the house and called to the
  cab-man to bring in the portmanteau. The horse could stand for a moment. He
  certainly looked like that kind of horse.</p>

  <p>The cab-man toiled up the stairs with the portmanteau on his shoulder.
  Without a word Von Wrangel laid five sovereigns, one after the other, on the
  table. The cab-man's eyes gleamed.</p>

  <p>"Got to be earned first, governor?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes. In the easiest way in the world. Give me your big overcoat, and
  your white top hat. I put them on this gentleman, who goes down to your cab
  and drives away. You need not be in the least afraid, for he has been used to
  horses all his life. He drives slowly, as if looking for a late fare, as far
  as, say, Belt-street, which is a thoroughfare thoughtfully left in darkness
  out of consideration for the poverty of its inhabitants. There your cab waits
  for you. I will show you a back way out, and you can carry the jug as if you
  were an honest son of the toil going for your evening beer after a long day's
  work. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>The cab-man nodded. There was no great risk here, seeing that his cab and
  horse together was not worth much more than the fee he was being paid for
  this slight service.</p>

  <p>"Right you are!" he exclaimed, as his hands clutched on the gold coins.
  "Lead the way, sir."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel came back presently. He avoided Gay's gratitude, and did not
  see the hand that the latter held out to him.</p>

  <p>"It is perfectly safe," he said. "You have nothing to fear. So long as you
  are believed to be here, so long will your foes haunt the neighbourhood. And
  here is your money. If you like to remain in England after this, you must
  take the consequences."</p>

  <p>It was perfectly safe. Gay sprang to the box and drove away with a
  flourish of his whip that had something professional about it. He smiled to
  himself as he passed two men lounging at the corner of the street, and
  blessed Von Wrangel's fertility of resource. He was free now, with money in
  his pocket, to turn his back upon England.</p>

  <p>But not yet. There was something to do yet. There was a little revenge to
  take first. His heart grew lighter as he thought of it. Once he had got rid
  of the cab-man he would be free to put his plan into execution. And here was
  Belt-street.</p>

  <p>The cab-man was unduly polite and sympathetic. He had made five pounds and
  a very nice-looking jug in a manner that could not possibly compromise him in
  the slightest. He had been in trouble himself, he hinted. He knew of some
  clean, cheap lodgings close by where no questions were asked, and where there
  were no less than three staircases.</p>

  <p>Gay was glad to hear it. Cheap, obscure lodgings and no questions asked
  were just what he required. His nerve was coming back to him now, and he was
  desperately tired. The sight of half a sovereign was all that was required to
  provide him with fairly comfortable quarters. He put out his gas and falling
  across the bed with his clothes on dropped into a heavy sleep.</p>

  <p>On the morrow he procured a razor and shaved himself. Then he proceeded to
  make certain changes in his personal appearance. The longing for strong drink
  was upon him, but he put that resolutely aside. Not yet; there would be
  plenty of time for that. He had his little revenge to take first. He laughed
  to himself as be thought of it; the big veins stood out on his forehead.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't have invented anything like that," he muttered. "It's perfect.
  If I can duly prevent him from interfering. But I am not afraid of that. I'll
  go down and see it all. I won't touch him&mdash;I won't so much as lay a
  finger upon him. And he will not go down till the evening train at 6.30, by
  which time it will be fairly dark. And then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Gay chuckled to himself again as he lighted a cigarette. For the rest of
  the day he lounged and ate and smoked. About six o'clock he paid his account
  and proceeded in the direction of Waterloo station. In the ticket office he
  waited. His eyes lighted up presently as a tall man with a soft hat over his
  eyes, came and asked for a first-class return to Stanmere.</p>

  <p>Gay came forward after the other man had gone. He put down his money and
  asked for a third-class return. He found himself presently in the corner of a
  smoking carriage, where he sat deep in thought, till the train reached its
  destination.</p>

  <p>"Pretty dark," he muttered, "but a moon presently. Now for it. I would not
  have missed this for all the money in England. And I'm safe here anyway."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch43"
     name="ch43"></a>XLIII. &mdash; ON THE TERRACE.</h2>

  <p>Mr. Spencer looked up again presently to find that Dick had gone&mdash;he
  had driven him away by his strange behaviour. What must the lad think of a
  man&mdash;a father&mdash;who deliberately objected to sight being restored to
  his only child? And what rational excuse could be made for delay?</p>

  <p>Anyway, Dick must not be allowed to go away like this. He must be
  persuaded, he must be shown clearly that there was need for a postponement of
  the operation. A source of excuses rose to Spencer's mind, only to be
  rejected as absurd and inadequate.</p>

  <p>Dick had left the building, and was striding in a white heat down
  Fleet-street, before his employer overtook him. He turned round as he heard
  his name spoken.</p>

  <p>"My dear boy, you must not go off like that," Spencer said with a strange
  humility. That was not the tone usually adopted by millionaires even to
  favourite employees. "I want to have a long chat with you. Call a cab and we
  will go to Cambria square."</p>

  <p>Prudence suggested a falling in with the suggestion. Not until Cambria
  square was reached was another word spoken. The place looked very empty and
  deserted without Mary. There was not a sign of her favourite flowers, even
  the violets had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't care for the smell," Spencer said, hesitating, as he
  noticed Dick's glance. "They have a very strange effect upon me. But for the
  sake of my child&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The speaker paused as he caught the expression on Dick's face. The later
  had not yet learnt the art of disguising his feelings.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me, sir," he said, "that your daughter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. But you do not understand. Suppose that I am your father. You
  are very fond of me; you regard me as one of the best men in the world. And
  you are blind. And when your sight comes back to you, you discover what I am.
  You find out my crime, you cannot help it. Do you suppose that you would care
  for me any longer?"</p>

  <p>Dick tore the argument to tatters furiously. What sort of a child would he
  be who turned his back upon his father like that? On the contrary, he would
  care all the more for him. If we would overlook grave faults in the friends
  we loved, how much more would we do so in the case of blood relations.</p>

  <p>"You do Mary an injustice," he cried. "If she found you out she would be
  sorry for you. Deep down in her heart would be a feeling of sympathy for the
  man who had suffered all these years in silence. I do not wish to try and
  penetrate your secret, sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I could not tell it. The story is unspeakable. But there is a deep, cruel
  deceit here. It was for a great and worthy end, but the deceit remains. Dick,
  I have never been so candid as this before. I tell you this thing must be
  postponed. Get Mary to wait, if only for a few weeks. I know that it sounds
  unmanly, inhuman, monstrous. Do it for my sake and Mary's, my dear lad. And
  you shall marry her, you shall be rich and prosperous, but do it."</p>

  <p>Dick sat there silent and ashamed that for one moment he should have
  heeded the voice and temptation. He had had a hard struggle of it, he knew
  what grinding poverty meant. He looked round the perfectly-appointed room,
  the suggestion of wealth and luxury, all of which he might share with Mary
  for the rest of his life.</p>

  <p>On the other hand he might lose it all, and slip back into the slough of
  despond again. A word from Spencer and it would be all over. And yet to keep
  that poor girl in the dark even for a few weeks longer! The cruelty of
  it!</p>

  <p>"I couldn't do it, sir," he answered; "I couldn't."</p>

  <p>"And if you refuse, have you reflected what it may mean?"</p>

  <p>Dick sprung from his chair and strode towards the door with his head in
  the air.</p>

  <p>"I have just done so," he said. "I can go down to the old grinding life
  again, but my conscience will be clear, and I shall sleep at night. But I
  shield not even the father when the daughter knows the truth. I think I had
  better go, sir."</p>

  <p>Spencer motioned Dick back to his chair. Dick's speech was cutting and
  bitter, but for the life of him he could not summon up courage enough to
  resent it.</p>

  <p>"I am a bad man," he said, as if speaking to himself. "At least I try not
  to be. Ever since I fell so low myself, I try to feel for the weaknesses of
  others. Dick, I had it in my heart just now to do you an evil thing. I was
  going to threaten you. But I see from your face that it would not be the
  slightest good. If you thought you were right you would go through with a
  thing to the bitter end. We will say no more about it. If you only knew what
  a criminal I am."</p>

  <p>His head fell forward, his eyes were full of remorse. Dick watched him
  steadily. What a strange paradox of a man he was. And Spencer had nothing to
  say on the subject because a new idea had come to him. In any case, it was
  not a very creditable way out of the difficulty, but it was more creditable
  than trying to coerce Dick into using his influence with Mary.</p>

  <p>"You are right and I am wrong," he went on. "You are a fine fellow, Dick,
  and you are going to make a son-in-law to be proud of. And Mary shall tell me
  all about it. There are reasons&mdash;grave reasons, but by no means shameful
  ones&mdash;why I cannot go to Stanmere. At the same time, I want to see my
  child for a few moments to-morrow evening, say a little before eight. If I am
  on the terrace, then you will try and get Mary to come and speak to me?"</p>

  <p>Dick promised eagerly enough. Surely there could be no harm in that. Mary
  would see her father, and the mere sight of her beautiful face and pathetic
  eyes would take all his doubts away. Why, whatever crime he had committed and
  whatever discovery he might make would only induce Mary to cling more closely
  to her father than before.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you are going to do this," Dick said, "I am glad I came here
  with you. On the face of it, it seemed such a terrible thing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I know it did. But if you only knew how cruelly I am placed!
  And sooner or later the whole truth is bound to come out. If a certain man
  discovered me now, and I could not have Mary by my side, all the work of
  years would be lost. And if she could see, would she be any longer by my
  side? That is the question that eternally tortures me."</p>

  <p>Dick was certain of it, he had no doubts whatever. How anybody could look
  in Mary's face and think otherwise was beyond his comprehension. And yet
  Spencer's face was grave and troubled. It seemed strange that a man in his
  position should lean for support on the shoulders of a mere boy. He went off
  presently, wondering and longing for the time when the mystery might be made
  clear.</p>

  <p>But Spencer's resolution was not so firm with the morning light. It was
  late in the afternoon before he despatched a telegram to Von Wrangel at
  Stanmere asking for an interview. A reply came back in due course to the
  effect that Von Wrangel had not yet arrived. Spencer groaned as he saw the
  message.</p>

  <p>"I must face it through," he said. "I must tell the truth, or part of it,
  and rely upon the good nature of the child. Von Wrangel might have saved me.
  Why do I drive these things off to the last moment? Why do I prevaricate so?
  And why are my nerves in this pitiable plight? I do not smoke or drink, I do
  not unduly strain myself. And yet there comes a time when my heart turns to
  water and I am a nerveless, trembling coward!"</p>

  <p>It was getting dusk before he braced himself to the effort of going to
  Stanmere. Even then Kant had to accompany him as far as the station. But it
  was near to the end of September now and getting quite dark. It was only
  under the shadow that Spencer felt anything like himself.</p>

  <p>"I shall be back by the ten o'clock train, Kant," he said. "Better come
  and meet me. There has not been much sign of the foe lately, Kant."</p>

  <p>Kant responded suitably. He could see that his employer was in a high
  state of nervousness. But once the train had started and the country reached,
  Spencer was himself again. The peaceful quietness, the bracing air, all had
  their effect on his nerves.</p>

  <p>He walked along with the step of a man who is quite certain of his
  surroundings. He passed into the park by way of a little gate and thence
  across the grass to the terrace. It was quite dark now, and the lights
  gleamed in the windows. The stable clock struck half-past seven. Spencer had
  not long to wait now, and he was wondering what he was going to say. He was
  going to do something against which his conscience revolted. But he would not
  think of that yet.</p>

  <p>He stood there like a thief in the night. Some of the blinds were not
  drawn yet; they were not down in the library, for instance. Somebody seemed
  to be very busy there. Spencer could make out a figure that looked like a
  nurse, and his heart beat a little faster. It was nurse Cecilia, of course,
  so that there was no great room for an effort of imagination there.</p>

  <p>But there was Von Wrangel also, in his shirt sleeves. He had his grimmest
  professional air, and he did not look in the least like the volatile
  collector of butterflies now. There was some queer-looking apparatus and a
  very strong electric light rigged up to one of the standard lamps by a
  flexible cord. It seemed to Spencer that he was only just in time.</p>

  <p>Then Dick came into the room and said a few words to Von Wrangel, who
  seemed to be displeased about something and irritably ordered him out. One of
  the drawing-room blinds was not quite down, and Spencer caught a glimpse of
  Mary and Lady Stanmere. He began to get impatient. Surely Dick had quite
  forgotten his promise; but the stable clock chimed again and it still wanted
  a quarter to eight. Spencer crept back from the window. A figure crossed the
  line of light. Spencer saw it, a queer little cry broke from him.</p>

  <p>"Stephen," he gasped. "I thought that you. I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He could say no more. He put up his hand as if to protect himself from a
  blow. But the blow did not fall, and Stephen stood grimly before him.</p>

  <p>"No, you don't," he whispered. "Come this way, so that we are hidden, safe
  from interruption. I know what you are here for and what you would do. This
  is my revenge, my little revenge, the thought of which is going to keep me
  warm on many a cold night. There will be an opening of eyes in more ways than
  one. You shall see what you shall see. Stir one step and I will kill you,
  thief and robber that you are. Look at the window yonder, and think what is
  going on. See, there she is, and her gallant lover by her side. Oh, this is
  great; it is glorious. And it all comes to me without my raising a finger.
  See into the library&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Somebody stepped forward and pulled down the blinds.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch44"
     name="ch44"></a>XLIV. &mdash; SEYMOUR SEES A FACE.</h2>

  <p>Molly came down the path to the house with a great bunch of late roses in
  her hand. Her dainty little nose was buried in the dewy blossoms. She made a
  pretty picture as she stood there, a fact by no means lost on Tom Seymour,
  who stood watching from the porch. Molly's happiness just now was a wholesome
  thing to contemplate.</p>

  <p>She had her lover back unexpectedly, and he was going to stay in England.
  There was no longer any necessity for him to go off to distant lands to seek
  a shadowy fortune. There was a house on the far side of the Warren that
  Seymour imagined would just suit him.</p>

  <p>"Plenty of glass," he was telling Molly, "so that we shall be able to
  indulge our mutual hobby for flowers. And the conservatory is between the
  drawing-room and dining-room, so that it is possible to make a perfect
  promenade. The place has been kept in the pink of condition. I used to dream
  of a house like that under the stars."</p>

  <p>Molly lifted a radiant face to her lover's.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you like the life yonder, Tom?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, I did and I didn't. There was a murderous lot in San Francisco. And
  once or twice I came very low down there, very low down indeed. I didn't tell
  you that, little girl; because it would only have made you miserable. But I
  saw some queer company. You shall hear my friend and partner, old Maxwell,
  tell the story."</p>

  <p>"Partner!" Molly laughed. "It sounds like a great business."</p>

  <p>"No capital and no connection," said Tom. "Maxwell was lucky with the gold
  that pretty near cost him his life. But he was a man born to adventure. When
  he comes back from Paris we will get him down here. Now come and see the
  house."</p>

  <p>Molly agreed, provided that they would be home by luncheon-time. She had
  promised to call and bring Mary back. Von Wrangel was coming down presently,
  and the operation was going to take place about 8 o'clock. There was nothing
  strange about the hour, as Tom seemed to imagine, seeing that Von Wrangel
  preferred to operate by a strong electric light in preference to the daytime.
  Mary was very nervous, and it was necessary to do something to distract her
  mind from the coming trouble.</p>

  <p>"We'll manage to keep her alive this afternoon," Seymour said, cheerfully.
  "Meanwhile we'll go and make up our minds about that house. Dick is smoking
  moodily in the morning-room. What is the matter with him to-day?"</p>

  <p>Molly explained. For the first time she told her lover all that she knew
  concerning Mary and the strange mystery that surrounded the poor blind girl.
  Seymour listened with the deepest interest. He seemed to have heard something
  like it before.</p>

  <p>"And so that man actually wanted to put off the operation," he said.
  "Why?"</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what Dick cannot understand. He said Mr. Spencer was
  horribly frightened when he heard what was going on. Mind you, he doesn't
  want his own daughter to see again&mdash;at least, he did not want her to see
  for a long time. He threatened Dick, and then he tried to bribe him. It is
  the strangest mystery you ever heard of. Mr. Spencer knows all the family at
  Stanmere; he is quite intimate with the place, and yet in as many words he
  tells Dick he dare not show his face in the house. That is why he got Dick to
  promise to bring Mary outside to see him for a few minutes."</p>

  <p>Tom admitted that the circumstances were peculiar.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps the man had committed some crime," he said. "He has done
  something that he is afraid will be found out. Perhaps there is someone who
  is in a position to blackmail him. He seems a good man, on the whole."</p>

  <p>"That is just it," Molly said eagerly. "He is a good man or he would not
  do good things, and Mary would not be so fond of him. And yet it looks as if
  he were about to behave now with the greatest and most deliberate
  cruelty."</p>

  <p>Seymour frankly gave up the whole thing. With the cheery optimism of youth
  he was quite sure that everything would come right in the end. Dick would
  marry his employer's daughter, and subsequently become proprietor of The
  Record, after which he would go into Parliament, and he and Molly would be
  modest people by the side of Dick and his wife.</p>

  <p>"Funny thing how small the world is," he said. "It was Maxwell who told me
  about the old house we are going to look at on the other side of the Warren.
  As a boy he used to live there. When he was in England seven years ago he
  visited his mother there."</p>

  <p>"A queer old lady, who dabbled in speculation," Molly cried. "We used to
  see her sometimes. But she never encouraged visitors, and so she knew nobody.
  She used to dress like a Quaker. It was common gossip that she made it
  impossible for any of her family to live with her. I understand that she died
  a few weeks ago."</p>

  <p>"Maxwell told me something of this," he said. "His mother liked to see her
  family sometimes, but not too often. The boys had their own rooms there,
  which were kept for them and never touched. There is little doubt that the
  poor old lady was quite mad."</p>

  <p>"And there are some lovely things in the house," Molly said.</p>

  <p>"Exquisite," Tom cried. "Everything is to be sold. There is much that is
  only lumber, but the old oak and the Chippendale and that class of furniture
  I shall make an offer for. Come along and see it for yourself. I've got the
  key in my pocket."</p>

  <p>Molly passed from room to room with a feeling of pure delight. She could
  not as yet quite grasp her own good fortune. A few days before she had been
  patiently waiting for her lover to make enough in foreign lands for her to
  join him. She had been prepared to rough it; she had looked forward to a life
  of hard work&mdash;no great trouble after the weary time in Pant-street. And
  here was Tom back, quite prosperous, and in a position to take a house such
  as Molly only permitted herself to dream about in romantic moments. She could
  imagine the lovely dining-room when she had filled it with flowers.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it exquisite!" she said, rapturously. "That oak sideboard is a
  dream. Fancy it covered with old silver! And those chairs, Tom! Am I really
  going to be mistress of a place like this? That peep into the conservatory is
  a picture in itself. Let us go and ramble all over the house."</p>

  <p>It was the same in most of the rooms. From the window there were glimpses
  of trim lawns and well-kept flower-beds, with a green fringe of trees
  beyond.</p>

  <p>"Here is a plain enough room, at any rate," Tom said, presently.
  "Something severely military about it. This must have been my friend
  Maxwell's room, because I recognise so many of the framed portraits that he
  has on the walls. Five or six of these men I know well. If they could all
  tell their life-stories it would keep Dick going for some time."</p>

  <p>Molly regarded the photographs with a new interest. These were the kind of
  men who went out to seek their fortunes, and took their lives in their hands
  in the doing of it. It was men of this class who had built up the British
  Empire. Molly regarded the grim, determined-looking faces with a look of
  admiration.</p>

  <p>"So you know most of these men?" she said. "I suppose when Mr. Maxwell
  came on a flying visit home he left these here. Tom, who is that?"</p>

  <p>Molly raised her voice as she spoke. She indicated a man with a
  fine-looking, open face and a fringe of beard that looked prematurely
  grey.</p>

  <p>"I forget his name," Tom said. "I never met him in the flesh, but I know
  the face, because Maxwell had another copy of that photo in his rooms at
  'Frisco. There is a story attached to it that Maxwell would not tell, though
  I got something of it through a scoundrel of a servant who should have been
  lynched if he'd had his rights. Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>Molly turned from the photographs to Tom.</p>

  <p>"I asked," she said, quietly, "because that is our Mary's father, Mr.
  Spencer. You need not smile; I am quite certain of it. When I tell you that
  Mary has been in San Francisco you may be disposed to believe that I have not
  made a mistake."</p>

  <p>But Tom could throw no further light on the mystery at all. On the subject
  of the origin of that photograph he could say nothing. Maxwell had been very
  reticent, and he was not at all the kind of man to gratify idle curiosity.
  The world was a small place, and there was no reason at all why this should
  not be a portrait of Mary's father. Maxwell would be back in England in a few
  days now, and then Molly might ask him for herself.</p>

  <p>"Mary has been in San Francisco in recent years I know," Molly said
  thoughtfully. "They had to leave there hurriedly, like criminals. And I
  hardly think that your friend Mr. Maxwell was the pursuing Nemesis. At the
  same time, I fully believe that he could tell us the whole
  story&mdash;indeed, he may help us. If he were not attached to Mr. Spencer he
  would not have retained two of his photographs."</p>

  <p>"Spoken like a wise little woman," Tom said cheerfully. "Meanwhile, let us
  think no more of the matter. And it's quite time to fetch Miss Mary."</p>

  <p>Mary was quite ready for her friends. She looked happy and cheerful
  enough, but her hands were working restlessly, and there was a touch of
  heightened colour in her cheeks. Lady Stanmere regarded her anxiously. It was
  an anxious time altogether.</p>

  <p>"Keep her thinking about something else," she said to Molly. "I know that
  the poor child was awake all night, because I had a bad night myself and
  heard her. Oh, my dear Molly, if only the next four-and-twenty hours were
  well over!"</p>

  <p>Molly kissed the speaker affectionately.</p>

  <p>"Herr Von Wrangel will not fail," she said. "He never does. And he would
  not have been so sanguine had he not felt certain as to the success of his
  operation. Is he here?"</p>

  <p>But Von Wrangel had not come, nor had any news arrived of him. He was not
  going to bring a nurse down with him, as Cecilia was quite sufficient.</p>

  <p>"Take Mary away and keep her out of doors," Lady Stanmere concluded. "I
  have not the youth and strength to dissemble my feelings. I cannot be gay.
  Keep Mary there, and don't bring her back before half-past seven. Anything to
  keep her mind off what is coming."</p>

  <p>Mary had almost forgotten her anxieties by the time of her return to
  Stanmere. For once Dick had failed to carry the situation as he should have
  done. He was quiet and moody as he walked through the park in the gathering
  darkness, and Molly was left to make the conversation.</p>

  <p>"I'll come and meet you presently," Tom said. "Meanwhile I'll smoke a
  cigar in the woods. I only wish that there was something for me to do."</p>

  <p>In woodland paths and dark byways Tom Seymour was quite at home. He
  finished his cigar and then turned to make his way into the avenue leading up
  to Stanmere. He walked quietly with the instinct of a man who is accustomed
  to danger and to whom the snapping of a twig is a serious peril. As he
  skirted the lawn he became aware that he was no longer alone.</p>

  <p>Two men were before him, two men face to face, and engaged in a bitter
  quarrel. The one was stern and resolute, the other obviously frightened, in
  fear of his life, in the last stage of terror.</p>

  <p>Their heads were thrown up in strong relief by the lights gleaming from
  Stanmere. Seymour could catch words like 'revenge' and 'retaliation,' and the
  note of deep satisfaction in the voice of one of the two men.</p>

  <p>There was not going to be any serious mischief done. Tom's instinct told
  him that. The deep, satisfied ring in the voice of the assailant did not
  point to violence. It was the voice on one who has sought a blood-stained
  revenge, and who by accident has found the revenge accomplished for him in a
  far more satisfactory manner. Tom crept back softly.</p>

  <p>As he did so he heard an unmistakable chuckle behind him. Somebody was
  watching the other two men and deriving great satisfaction from the fact. Tom
  stepped back further still. Behind the bowl of a tree he struck a match.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he said, "I have lost my way. Can you tell me?"</p>

  <p>"Don't know much about it myself," the other man stammered. "All I can say
  is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>What it was Seymour never knew. The speaker broke off suddenly, looked
  into Tom's face redly glowing in the light of the match, and then raced off
  towards the house as if all the horrors of a sudden volcano were upon
  him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch45"
     name="ch45"></a>XLV. &mdash; A FAILURE.</h2>

  <p>Von Wrangel came down to Stanmere in a frame of mind calculated to
  surprise any acquaintance who only knew the lighter side of his nature. It
  was not that he was afraid of failure or distrusted his powers in the least.
  He feared something quite different. There was the possibility that something
  might happen at the last moment to prevent the operation at all.</p>

  <p>A telegram from Spencer was awaiting him. There was no great fear of
  Spencer appearing in person. And, if he did, Von Wrangel knew how to deal
  with the matter. But if Mary by any chance saw her father and he suggested a
  postponement of the operation, she would immediately fall in with his wishes.
  She had a gentle nature, but she could be firm, if Von Wrangel was any judge
  of faces.</p>

  <p>"The most extraordinary complication," the little German muttered as he
  busied himself in his own room. "The man dare not interfere, and the only one
  who has a right to is far away by this time. And here is Lady Stanmere as
  much in the dark as anyone else. Nobody knows the truth but Martlett and
  myself, and I guessed it. I dare say I shall get myself into a fine mess when
  the business is finished, but I can't help that. As to the girl, she will
  behave like a brick. I shall be glad when the next hour is over."</p>

  <p>Dinner was not thought of at Stanmere to-night. Even the servants' hall
  had nothing else to speak of but the forthcoming operation. In the
  dining-room Von Wrangel had a chop and a very small glass of claret and
  water. Lady Stanmere watched him with a pretence of eating that would not
  have deceived the smallest child.</p>

  <p>"You are quite sure that you are ready," Lady Stanmere asked.</p>

  <p>"My dear lady the question is superfluous," Von Wrangel said. "You have
  asked it at regular, not to say monotonous, intervals of ten minutes. Please
  try another. Ask me, for instance, if I have any doubt as to the success of
  the operation."</p>

  <p>"Well, have you?" Lady Stanmere suggested innocently.</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel rubbed his hair till it resembled a mop. He would be cool
  enough when the time came, but he was very nervous now.</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest," he said. "I stake my reputation upon it. It is a
  moral certainty."</p>

  <p>"And yet your hands are trembling worse than my own," Lady Stanmere
  murmured.</p>

  <p>"Of course they are. That is eagerness to begin, the wild desire to be at
  work once more. And what do you suppose I have been doing all day? Why, I
  have performed two exactly similar operations like Miss Mary's, both with
  equal success. I go to one of the hospitals; I disclose my identity and ask
  for an operation; they welcome me with open arms. I am quite successful."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am glad to hear that. And yet your hand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind my hand. Look here. Suppose your eyes are affected. I take the
  pencil. So."</p>

  <p>He took a pencil from the table and just touched the pupil of Lady
  Stanmere's eye. The touch was so firm, and yet so quick that she hardly
  blinked.</p>

  <p>"There," he cried. "What do you think of that? No other hand in England
  could have done the same thing. But my patient should be here by this time.
  It is getting quite dark."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel fidgetted about restlessly; he had good reason for so doing.
  So long as Mary was under his personal supervision he felt master of the
  situation. But all through the business there had been the most irritating
  interruptions, the constant changing of the situation. Spencer was an unknown
  factor, who might come on the scene at any moment. Spencer would have
  prevented the operation. Von Wrangel knew why and what the reason was. But
  that made no difference to him. He had made up his mind in his headstrong way
  to go through with the thing, and not even a royal command would have changed
  him from the determination. It was all a matter of time. And Mary had not
  come back yet.</p>

  <p>He met the little party presently on the terrace. He grasped Mary by the
  arm and hurried her into the house almost rudely. Von Wrangel in a temper was
  a new light to them. They had never seen anything of the kind in the little
  German before.</p>

  <p>"Gently, gently," Dick expostulated. "If you are out of temper&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am in the vilest rage in the world," Von Wrangel cried. "Say another
  word to me, you Dick, and I shall assault you violently. My patient ought to
  have been back long ago. Now that she is in the house she is entirely in my
  hands."</p>

  <p>Dick drew the irate speaker a little on one side.</p>

  <p>"Spencer is somewhere here," he whispered. "He can't come to the house, he
  says."</p>

  <p>"Excellent!" Von Wrangel grunted. "He can't come to the house, which is
  capital. He knows what is going to take place because you told him. I daresay
  I should have told him myself under similar circumstances, but you were a
  fool all the same. And so the anxious father has crept down to have a few
  private words with the child before I begin, eh?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I gather," Dick replied.</p>

  <p>"Then he is not going to do anything of the kind. You can pursue what you
  call a policy of masterly inactivity, or you can go out and tell him, just as
  you please. The patient is mine now, and I am going to operate. I am not
  afraid of Spencer, for reasons that will be seen presently. And when those
  reasons are made plain, my young friend, you are going to get the surprise of
  your life. Go out and tell the man it is too late for him to see his
  daughter."</p>

  <p>Dick hesitated. He had never seen Von Wrangel in this masterful mood
  before. At any rate he had made a promise, and it was his duty to tell Mr.
  Spencer that he was not in a position to keep it. He passed out on to the
  dark terrace. He could see nothing for a moment, and then the sound of voices
  fell on his ear. The blinds in the library were not yet down, and in a band
  of light two men were talking earnestly, the one protesting, the other
  fiercely angry.</p>

  <p>Dick rubbed his eyes in astonishment. There were Spencer and the other
  man, like two people 'taken' on the same photographic film&mdash;Spencer and
  the man who had so maltreated him in Cambria Square on the eventful night of
  Dick's introduction to the mystery.</p>

  <p>From the broad band of light falling on Spencer's face, it was evident
  that he was just as terribly frightened as he had been on the previous
  occasion. In a dull way his white face was turned upon his companion. Dick
  heard a few words as he crept away as silently as he had come. Evidently
  Spencer had not the slightest desire to see his daughter any more. The other
  man had defied him to do so. There was no violence going to be done, for the
  other man was too full of triumph for that.</p>

  <p>Dick turned away with a deeper feeling of mystery than ever. Who was the
  other man? Even if he had solved that question he would have been as much in
  the dark as ever. Perhaps Von Wrangel would be able to throw some light on
  the subject.</p>

  <p>But Von Wrangel had something else to do. He drove Dick from the library
  with contemptuous, not to say insulting words; he seemed only able to
  tolerate the presence of Nurse Cecilia just now. The latter was moving about
  the room setting things in order, a brilliant light lay on the table which
  had been affixed to one of the standard lamps by a long flex. An operating
  table had been improvised out of a long invalid chair.</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel held a thin needle-like knife in his hand. The blade was
  nearly as fine as a hair and brittle as glass. He gave a gesture of
  impatience as he took the lance from its case.</p>

  <p>"I ought to have three of those," he said. "But I find that two are
  broken. And they cost me eight pounds each in London to-day. They are the
  most perfect specimens of cutlery in the world, and now two of them are
  useless."</p>

  <p>"Can you manage without them?" Cecilia asked.</p>

  <p>"I can do with one, of course. But they are so delicate that an accident
  might spoil everything. If I laid them carelessly on a chair for instance. I
  shall have to operate on your eyes, too. They are red. Is it weakness or
  tears?"</p>

  <p>"Tears," Cecilia said, half defiantly. "My husband has been here again, it
  is weakness, but there are times when I cannot help it. I ought not to
  mention it just now, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I asked you a plain question. I shall know how to deal with that man
  presently. I hope you did not give him any money. Now, go and bring in the
  patient."</p>

  <p>The thing had begun at length. Mary lay at full length on the couch with
  her face to the light. All Von Wrangel's irritation had vanished now; he was
  quiet and gentle, his hand steady and true as steel. He had his hand on the
  patient's pulse.</p>

  <p>"That is right," he said. "You are not nervous now. All you have to do is
  to lie perfectly still, and I shall give you no more pain than a pin prick.
  Brave girl. Did you feel that?"</p>

  <p>"Not more than a touch of a needle point," Mary whispered.</p>

  <p>"And yet the thing is nearly half done. It looks so ridiculously easy, and
  yet the breadth of a hair makes all the difference. What's that?"</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel started nervously, and the delicate lance fell on the carpet.
  The man's nerves and eyes and brain were strung to the highest tension; the
  noise of a cry, followed by a smashing of glass, as if a whole greenhouse had
  collapsed, threw him entirely off his balance. With a stifled exclamation he
  picked up his lance and showed it to Cecilia.</p>

  <p>"I have forgotten something," he said, quietly. His face was as dark as
  night, there were beads on his forehead. "Come this way for a moment, nurse.
  Lie still, my patient."</p>

  <p>He drew Cecilia hurriedly out. The sound of smashing glass echoed through
  the house. The expression on Von Wrangel's face was not good to see.</p>

  <p>"I have partially failed," he said hoarsely. "One eye is a success, but it
  is useless without the help and sympathy of the other. Another moment and the
  thing would have been accomplished. For Heaven's sake tell your patient that
  I cannot go any further to-night, that we must wait a day two, that I am
  perfectly satisfied, anything to comfort her."</p>

  <p>"I shall be able to manage it," Cecilia said quietly. "Perhaps
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Aye, to-morrow. And now to see what all that infernal din was about. And
  if anybody wants to know where I am, I had to go to London. To-morrow night
  at the same time nurse. And see that you don't mention it to a soul."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch46"
     name="ch46"></a>XLVI. &mdash; IN TROUBLE.</h2>

  <p>There are few things more pitiable than a scoundrel out of luck. He is the
  scorn of all God-fearing people; he may swagger and bully as much as he
  likes, but there is ever the consciousness of the gulf between himself and an
  honest man. All his cunning tricks and dodges have failed; his so-called
  friends have fallen upon him; the policemen as he slinks by mark him with a
  cold eye that makes a note as he passes.</p>

  <p>For the moment Horace Venner had fallen very low indeed. He had to button
  his absurdly showy coat across his chest to conceal the want of a vest
  beneath. There was a dinginess about his linen that told its own tale of
  nights spent on open seats and toilettes performed mostly by the aid of his
  ten dirty fingers.</p>

  <p>To add zest to existence the police were after him. He was perilously near
  to absolute starvation, his limbs shook oddly and his eyes were misty. And
  yet with all this struggle to keep body and soul together, Venner hugged to
  his breast a secret worth thousands. If he could only find the right man, he
  might be swaggering about in those blazing, blaring restaurants and served
  with the best by patient waiters. If he could only find that one man in
  London. He was like one who was starving in the desert and suddenly stumbles
  on a gold mine.</p>

  <p>He had been very near that man more than once. On one occasion he thought
  he had found him, but he had only got a thrashing for his pains instead. It
  was maddening. There he was actually in want of a meal whilst those
  thousands&mdash;</p>

  <p>He would go back to Stanmere. The police would not take the trouble to
  look for him there again. And his wife might be good for something. For the
  first time in his career Venner was reduced to the tricks of the road. He got
  a meal or two that way, and a shilling or two from a cynical philanthropist
  who was not in the least deceived by Venner's glib falsehood. If his wife
  would not give him a few pounds he would know the reason why.</p>

  <p>But not again. Cecilia was quite firm. If Venner called upon Mr. Martlett
  he would be sent to Australia and his passage paid, with a few shillings for
  the voyage and a further ten pounds as his annuity, but not a penny would
  Cecilia part with. Venner urged and stormed and swore; he even threatened,
  but nothing seemed to shake the resolution on that pale, white face.</p>

  <p>"I have finished with you," Cecilia said, quietly. "You will get nothing
  further out of me. Here are two shillings to pay your fare back to London. If
  you raise your hand to me again like that I will set the dogs on you."</p>

  <p>Venner growled something, and so did the retriever dog by Cecilia's side.
  In the woman's purse were gold pieces that gleamed and glistened. They meant
  food and warmth and shelter and such vulgar dissipations as Venner's soul
  loved.</p>

  <p>"You no longer care for me," he whined.</p>

  <p>"Care for you!" Cecilia cried. "If I heard of your death to-day I should
  go down on my knees and thank God for His infinite mercy. Fool that I was to
  imagine that I could make a better man of you! There is contamination in all
  you touch. If you had never come to Stanmere as a body servant to the young
  men what misery might have been saved! You owe everything to the family at
  Stanmere, and yet if you could find the one to whom you owe the most you
  would try to ruin him. But he is beyond your reach."</p>

  <p>Cecilia turned away with her skirts held high, as if fearful of
  contamination. She had never beaten her worthless husband quite so low as
  this before. He felt himself aggrieved, there were tears of maudlin self-pity
  in his eyes. He found a woodside public-house, where he ate a meal of sorts
  and talked like a landed proprietor, and at dusk made his way to the station.
  He had his pride still, and he had no fancy to be detected in Stanmere
  without a vest. And there was an hour to wait at the station. There was a
  train in from London first; it crept in presently, and Venner curiously
  watched the faces of the few passengers by the light of the two flickering
  oil lamps on the platform.</p>

  <p>Venner's languid curiosity received a sudden stimulus. From a first-class
  carriage almost in front of him a tall, handsome man with a grey beard
  alighted. Hardly had he passed the barriers before another, identically like
  the first one, but more shabbily dressed, leapt from the train and followed
  his prototype into outer darkness.</p>

  <p>Venner rubbed his eyes in amazement. He was trembling from head to foot
  with a sudden triumph; he felt almost physically sick with it. His head was
  spinning with the shock of a great discovery.</p>

  <p>"It's my man," he muttered. "The first was my man; and I should have let
  him go, thinking it was Mr. Stephen, if Stephen himself hadn't popped out
  like that. I've been deceived, that's what's the matter with me; cruelly
  deceived. I see it all now."</p>

  <p>He must have seen very brilliantly, for he had to press his hands to his
  eyes to shut out the dazzling vision. A porter with gruff sympathy asked if
  anything was the matter. Venner pulled himself together and staggered to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"Left my money behind me, and haven't any left for a ticket," he said.
  "I'll have to go back and return by the next train. Unless you could
  manage&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No," the porter said, shortly, "I couldn't."</p>

  <p>Venner went off chuckling. His limbs were still shaky and uncertain, but
  he had forgotten his hunger and that insatiable thirst for liquid refreshment
  now. By mere accident he had found what he had been looking for for years. By
  a still greater chance he had penetrated the mystery that had puzzled him. He
  felt hot and indignant as he thought of the lost opportunities.</p>

  <p>But he knew everything now. He knew that one of those men was following
  the other, and that the destination of the two was Stanmere. Well, he would
  follow in his turn. He might hear something useful. The prosperous one would
  stay at Stanmere; he would be certain to return by a later train, and Venner
  would follow. In his mind's eye he saw himself comfortably housed to-night,
  feasted upon game and champagne, with brandy and choice cigars to follow.
  To-morrow he would go to a tailor and hold up his head once more.</p>

  <p>Yes, those two men were going to Stanmere right enough. One was dogging
  the other without a doubt, and Venner proceeded to dog the two. What could
  they be after, seeing that neither of them made any attempt to gain the
  house? Not that it mattered in the least to Venner so long as he did not lose
  sight of his quarry.</p>

  <p>They were both in the grounds now, on the terrace, watching something that
  was going on in the house. Venner secreted himself behind a tree with his
  back to it. He wanted to be quite sure that there were not depths and
  complications yet that he had not been able to fathom. If he could only learn
  what those men were saying he would be safe.</p>

  <p>He heard at length, enough and more than enough. There was no longer any
  doubt now as to which was his man. Venner knew everything in the light of
  recent experiences; he even gathered what was going to take place in the
  library at Stanmere.</p>

  <p>"And so that is the way I was fooled," he muttered. "The very man I wanted
  has passed and repassed me when I was pretty nigh starving! It makes me
  almost weep to think of it all. All the time I might have been in West End
  chambers, with a man of my own and a private hansom and a good banking
  account behind me. But it was clever, and no mistake about that; very clever.
  And I'll bet that old fox Martlett was at the bottom of it."</p>

  <p>Venner chuckled a little more loudly than was quite prudent. It seemed to
  him that he could hear a quiet footstep close by. Was it possible that the
  police&mdash;then a match flared out, and Venner caught sight of a face and a
  pair of dark eyes looking into his with a cool measure of surprise and an
  unmistakable recognition.</p>

  <p>Venner's heart suddenly sank into his boots. Here was the whole fabric
  shattered like a cloud before a gale. Here, too, was a danger so great that
  the mere idea of facing it was out of the question. Venner put his head down
  and fled&mdash;fled in such terror that he had not the slightest idea where
  he was going. He could hear the flash of footsteps behind, and they were
  gaining upon him.</p>

  <p>"What luck," he sobbed; "what cruel, cruel luck! Oh, Mr. Tom Seymour, if I
  was only on top of you in some quiet spot with a knife in my hand!"</p>

  <p>Alas! for the immutability of human wishes; instead of this, Tom Seymour
  was close behind and running with the ease and speed of a trained athlete. On
  and on Venner struggled, sobbing and struggling for breath, something full of
  dim luminous light rose before his tired eyes. There was a tremendous clash
  and clatter of falling glass, and the hunted man was on his back in a small
  conservatory with Seymour standing over him.</p>

  <p>"Not much damage done," Seymour said, as he surveyed his fallen foe by the
  electric light. "A little cut about the face, but no more."</p>

  <p>"I should like to know what this means, sir," a quiet, respectful voice
  asked.</p>

  <p>Goss stood in the doorway, quiet, respectful and unruffled. He seemed to
  recognise Venner as one does undesirable vermin that is unfortunately
  impossible to be without.</p>

  <p>"I have made a capture," Seymour said coolly. "I regret the damage, and I
  sincerely hope that Lady Stanmere has not been alarmed. I am staying with my
  friend, Mr. Stephenson, at Shepherd's Spring. If Herr Von Wrangel will step
  this way when he has a moment or two to spare I shall feel obliged. Meantime,
  you can leave this fellow to me. For the sake of the house, it will be better
  not to make a fuss. I think you understand me?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," Goss said, quietly. "It shall be as you please; and if you
  can rid us permanently of that rascal you will be doing the house a great
  service."</p>

  <p>Goss went off calmly, as if a catastrophe of this kind was quite in
  accordance with proprieties. He would have said himself that Mr. Seymour was
  a stranger to him, but that he always knew a gentleman when he saw one.
  Seymour looked at this sorry capture.</p>

  <p>"Well, Venner," he said, "this is a bit of hard luck for you."</p>

  <p>"It's cruel," Venner whined. "I fancied to-day wouldn't be bad, but it has
  been; and just when everything was turning out so rosy! It's very hard, Mr.
  Seymour, sir&mdash;very hard. If you wouldn't mind telling me, what are you
  going to do with me?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's not exactly my funeral, as we used to say out yonder. Take you
  to London and lay an information against you for robbery and fraud. By that
  means, you see, the police would hold you by the heels till the necessary
  papers arrived to support a more serious charge. After that I could safely
  leave you in the hands of my friend, Mr. Maxwell."</p>

  <p>Venner stood there nervously grinding the palms of his hands together.
  They were wet and hot, and the grimy drops rolled off them. Something was
  working up and down in the man's throat with the regularity of a steam
  engine. He had the dazed blue look of the condemned criminal on his way to
  the scaffold. Venner was pretty nearly past all feeling now.</p>

  <p>"If you would give me another chance, sir," he whispered.</p>

  <p>"Not an inch! A real, full-blooded scoundrel I can do with. There is hope
  for him; indeed, I have known more than one resolve himself into a
  respectable member of society. But you are one of the pests of humanity. If
  you came into a million of money to-morrow you would be as great a rascal as
  ever. I am going to see you handed over to the police."</p>

  <p>"When Mr. Maxwell comes back from America, sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door opened and Von Wrangel came in. He was still white and trembling
  with the passion caused by the failure of his operation. But there was just
  the flicker of a smile in his eye as he caught sight of Venner standing
  there.</p>

  <p>"You seem to know this man, Mr. Seymour," said he. "So this is the secret
  of that din just now, the din that caused me to&mdash;but do you know
  him?"</p>

  <p>"I know enough to hang him," Seymour said, crisply.</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel's eyes glistened.</p>

  <p>"Good!" he cried. "I am glad to hear it. Let him be hanged by all means.
  Only, if you would do the family a signal service, let the lawyer, Mr.
  Martlett, see him first. Afterwards, the interesting ceremony may proceed
  without delay. You will go up to London by the last train, and I shall come
  along. The night's work is not going to be so unsuccessful after all."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch47"
     name="ch47"></a>XLVII. &mdash; NOT QUITE A FAILURE AFTER ALL.</h2>

  <p>Von Wrangel had flung down his instrument in a passionate rage. He was
  occasionally given to childish fits of anger of that kind, as men with the
  artistic temperament often are. Not that he had absolutely failed; indeed, so
  far as he had gone, he had no reason to be dissatisfied with the result of
  his experiment.</p>

  <p>But a sheer accident had deprived him of the chance of finishing it. Also
  he had positively promised Mary that she should see as well as anybody else
  again. And Von Wrangel shrank from giving pain outside the necessary pain
  that surrounds his profession.</p>

  <p>How would Mary take it? he wondered. Under the circumstances of the case
  it was far better that she should be left to the tender care of Nurse
  Cecilia. Von Wrangel hurried out of the room, resolved to return presently
  when his presence would be more desirable.</p>

  <p>Mary remained lying as she was for a few minutes. She had got herself well
  in hand now. She had been patient so many years that an hour or two made
  little difference. She wondered vaguely what that crash of glass meant, and
  why both doctor and nurse had hurried from the room. Cecilia came back
  presently outwardly calm, but greatly agitated and disappointed. Like Von
  Wrangel, she had set her heart upon the success of the operation.</p>

  <p>"What does it all mean?" Mary asked.</p>

  <p>"Possibly one of the cattle has strayed into the grounds and blundered
  into the conservatory," Cecilia said. "Goss seems to have taken the matter in
  hand. Miss Mary, I am afraid that we cannot go any further with the operation
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say," Mary faltered, "that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, no!" Cecilia cried. "The doctor was operating with some very
  delicate instruments when the crash came, and he dropped it, and the point
  was broken, and he hasn't got another one. I have never seen a doctor in such
  a rage before."</p>

  <p>A faint smile crossed Mary's lips.</p>

  <p>"I can imagine Herr Von Wrangel," she said. "But it is all right if he is
  angry. If there was any chance of failure, he would be one of the first to
  show it. What shall you do?"</p>

  <p>"I shall put a bandage over the eye that has been operated upon, and you
  are on no account to remove it. And if you are wise you will go straight to
  bed."</p>

  <p>Mary complied with the suggestion in her sweet, uncomplaining way. She
  seemed tired and exhausted now, for the strain and suspense were a little
  greater than she had expected. Von Wrangel, with a queer bright alertness on
  his face, was waiting for Cecilia when she came down.</p>

  <p>"What did you tell her?" he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I told her exactly the truth," Cecilia replied. "It seemed to me far
  best, and she is such a lovely patient. She was not in the least frightened
  or cast down, and she looks forward to the next time. If I did not do right,
  sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You did exactly right," Von Wrangel said. "You are a pearl among women.
  If it had not been for that most unfortunate business in the
  conservatory&mdash;but never mind that. I am going to town by the last train
  on most important business. I am going to open more sets of eyes than one.
  Let Lady Stanmere know that I shall be back at mid-day to-morrow, and don't
  say a word as to our next venture. Good-night."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel bustled off in his quick fashion, and was seen no more. But
  according to his promise, he came down the following day with the air of one
  who has accomplished great things. Lady Stanmere awaited him in the
  drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"Where is the patient?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere replied that the patient was in bed, and had no intention of
  getting up till dinner time. She had thought it best to keep the girl quiet,
  and even the young people from Shepherd's Spring had been denied admission.
  Von Wrangel rubbed his hands approvingly.</p>

  <p>"That is right," he said. "Couldn't be better. I meant to operate again
  to-day, but my new lance has not come from the makers yet, so it must be
  to-morrow instead."</p>

  <p>"WILL the next experiment be successful?" Lady Stanmere asked, with a
  steady look. "Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"There is no experiment," Von Wrangel said. "Would I EXPERIMENT on such a
  lovely pair of eyes as those? I tell you I am certain. But for
  that&mdash;that cow blundering into the conservatory and the breaking of my
  lance. But you will see what you will see to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand what happened," Lady Stanmere said.</p>

  <p>"It was a simple accident. I had three of those lances. They are as fine
  as the hair of your head. Two of them got broken, and when the noise came I
  dropped the third and broke that. The place I had to touch was so minute that
  the most dainty instrument was required. For years I have tried to find that
  spot; nobody else has found it. There is the smallest contraction of the
  muscles from weakness; a touch, and the contraction has gone. But, my word,
  what a touch it requires! So there is the story of the operation, and why it
  failed. Lady Stanmere, I do not regret it."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel walked excitedly up and down the room, a fine contrast to the
  still grey figure patiently knitting. He seemed wildly excited about
  something.</p>

  <p>"I shall bring back sight to those eyes," he said. "I shall bring back
  sight to other eyes too. The cloud is rolling away, the cloud is going. Ah,
  Ah!"</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere listened calmly. She was quite used to these outbursts from
  a man who would waste his time over a butterfly or cheerfully take over the
  administration of a kingdom. The man was ever sanguine, the doer of great
  things in a dream.</p>

  <p>"Hadn't you better see your patient?" she suggested.</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel came tumbling down to earth again.</p>

  <p>"I will do so," he cried. "A practical idea of yours. A few hours and the
  condition of everything will be changed. Permit me to kiss your hand."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel went upstairs in the highest spirits. He found Mary propped up
  on bed with Cecilia reading to her. She heard his step and smiled as he came
  in. On the whole, the girl was taking her disappointment in a really
  beautiful manner.</p>

  <p>"Now there is a patient for you," Von Wrangel cried. "The best in the
  world and a model to all others. Let me have a look at that one eye."</p>

  <p>He removed the bandage as gently as a woman could have done. Then he
  spread out his hand close to the blue pupil and expanded his fingers.</p>

  <p>"You imagine that you see something," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Is it imagination?" Mary asked. "I seemed to see in a dim kind of way, a
  long thin hand with some deep red freckles on the back, and there was a
  signet ring on the little finger with a purple stone in it. Now it has all
  gone again, but it was quite distinct."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel smiled as he replaced the bandage. There were red freckles on
  his hands and his little finger most certainly carried a signet with a purple
  stone.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," he said in what he fondly imagined to be a professional
  voice. "It was my hand that you saw just now. Really, the thing has turned
  out better than I expected. But you are not to use that eye till the other
  has been operated upon, because that would be dangerous. What did I tell you?
  Ah, this is going to be a splendid case."</p>

  <p>Mary lay back on the pillow crying quietly. Von Wrangel nodded
  approvingly. Those gentle tears would do the girl good, and he had partially
  feared a more violent outburst. He drew the nurse gently from the room, his
  own eyes suspiciously moist.</p>

  <p>"Leave her to herself," he said. "Leave her to herself as much as
  possible. A nature like hers does not need a lot of people fussing about her.
  She is quiet and devotional, and she has herself well in hand. Go in
  occasionally and ask her if she wants anything, but nothing more. That poor
  girl's thoughts are and will be too near Heaven for us to intrude upon
  them."</p>

  <p>Cecilia nodded. She had no words for the moment.</p>

  <p>"I am sure you are right," she contrived to say at length. "Oh, what a
  great doctor you are, Herr Von Wrangel, what a great doctor!"</p>

  <p>"Great fool," the German growled. "If you only knew what a fool!"</p>

  <p>But he had plumbed the depths of Mary's thoughts exactly. She desired
  nothing better than to be alone. She was very near Heaven at that moment. Her
  spirit seemed to be raised up and glorified. For hours she lay there thinking
  of the past and the future. Cecilia came in from time to time, but Mary
  wanted nothing. She was thinking of the delight of the beautiful world again,
  of what her father would say when she could look into his face once more.</p>

  <p>They were dining downstairs and the house was very quiet. If her father
  could be near her now. . . . She seemed to hear his footsteps and his voice
  calling her. . . . With a strange dreamy impulse upon her she got out of bed
  and felt her way to the door. She was certain that she could hear somebody in
  the corridor, it sounded in her ears like her father's steps.</p>

  <p>Just as she was she ventured into the corridor. She tripped over some
  hangings and clutched at the air for support. The bandage dropped from her
  eyes, and just for a moment she had a vision of the old corridor, the old
  pictures, the gleam of the electrics on oak and sliver, and a little way off
  a man in a grey suit, with a red tie and white spats over his patent leather
  boots. The broad forehead and the melancholy eyes, the grey beard, were
  familiar to her. It was her father, not the harsh-faced man that she used to
  know, but her father's face chastened by sorrow, and rendered soft, by the
  passing of time.</p>

  <p>"Father!" Mary cried. "Father! you have come to me! Let me look&mdash;"
  The figure gave a cry and vanished. There was a murmur of voices in the hall,
  the rustle of Cecilia's skirts as she flew upstairs. Mary stood there in the
  white gown and with the fair hair over her shoulders, the bandage in her
  hand.</p>

  <p>"How could you!" Cecilia cried, as she replaced the bandage, hurriedly.
  "How could you, Miss Mary! Come back to your room at once."</p>

  <p>Mary followed without protest. She was crying quietly.</p>

  <p>"I heard my father's step and his voice calling," she said. "And I saw
  him, Cecilia. I never knew what a noble face he had till now."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch48"
     name="ch48"></a>XLVIII. &mdash; RETALIATION.</h2>

  <p>Spencer stood there cowering fearfully, as if waiting for a blow. He
  seemed to have shrunk smaller, he looked greyer and prematurely aged. His
  attitude was that of the patient, despairing wife who knows what it is to
  feel the weight of her master's hand, and suffers uncomplainingly. The other
  man laughed with bitter contempt.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of yourself, my brother?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Spencer said nothing. He looked up to the woods behind Stanmere, and then
  back the long facade of the house again. How many years, centuries ago, was
  it that he was a happy boy there? And the man by his side, the man whom he
  held in such dreadful fear, had shared his joys and sorrows. There was
  something unreal about the whole thing.</p>

  <p>"I have done you no real harm," Spencer said at length. His eyes were
  turned now with a fascinated interest on the library window. "You have not
  suffered through me."</p>

  <p>"That is a lie. Why palter in this way? I meant to have your life once.
  Mine was forfeit, and I said that yours should be, too. But there is a better
  revenge than that. If I killed you there would be an end of the matter, but
  my revenge is going to last as long as you last. Why did you come down
  to-night! Tell me that?"</p>

  <p>"I came down to see Mary, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Prevent, this operation. Shall I tell you why?"</p>

  <p>Silence on the part of Spencer. The respected philanthropist looked very
  small and mean now. A spectator would have picked out the other man as the
  better of the two.</p>

  <p>"I found it all out by accident," Stephen went on. "I was in
  trouble&mdash;you know what trouble, it was partly my own fault, but that has
  nothing to do with it. I managed to get to our friend Von Wrangel's rooms,
  and there I saw a telegram. I knew that the girl was going to recover her
  sight, and I knew you would try and prevent it."</p>

  <p>"No, no," Spencer cried. "Only to postpone it for a little time."</p>

  <p>"And so on, ad infinitum. You know that you dare not permit it. I felt
  that you would come down here in this fashion, and I watched you. You haven't
  got that smart young fellow Dick Stevenson to help you this time. They seem
  to be busy over yonder. It is good to feel that by now that poor girl can
  see."</p>

  <p>There was no feeling of sympathy in the words, nothing more than a certain
  savage satisfaction. Spencer could think of no personal justification. The
  other man shook him savagely.</p>

  <p>"Do you hear?" he went on. "Oh, you need not be afraid for your cowardly
  life. I have better uses for you than that. The girl can see, my brother. She
  will see you, for instance. She is very fond of you; she regards you as a
  prince among men. And when she sees you with open eyes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are a fiend!" Spencer cried; "a perfect fiend. If you only
  knew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pshaw! I know more than you imagine&mdash;there's somebody listening.
  What was that?"</p>

  <p>A kind of chuckle, ending in a cry of fear. Somebody dashed headlong
  across the terrace and past the line of light thrown by the windows, and
  immediately a second figure flashed along in hot pursuit of the first.</p>

  <p>"If that is any game of yours," Stephen said, fiercely, "I'll take good
  care&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no," Spencer cried; "I swear I am as much in the dark as you
  are."</p>

  <p>Stephen grunted something inarticulate. There was no doubting the evident
  sincerity of Spencer's words. He was looking towards the flying figures
  open-mouthed. Once more Stephen shook him savagely.</p>

  <p>"You know something about it," he said.</p>

  <p>"Only what I can guess. We were both being watched, watched by the last
  man in the world that I desired to meet. Now that he has seen us both
  together all my sacrifice will be in vain."</p>

  <p>"Who on earth are you talking about?" Stephen demanded.</p>

  <p>"Venner," Spencer replied. "That was Horace Venner."</p>

  <p>"Your old valet and fidus Achates. So he has got hold of some scent and
  was blackmailing you. Or he would have done so if he had found you. I begin
  to see day-light. Hullo!"</p>

  <p>Then came the sudden smash of glass and a frightened kind of cry from
  somewhere. With a feeling of curiosity Stephen Gay hurried forward. There
  were passions and emotions at play here, and that kind of thing appealed to
  him. Spencer was forgotten. He might have placed the darkness between himself
  and his antagonist.</p>

  <p>But he could not leave here yet. He had been prevented from interfering,
  the precious moment had been lost, and by this time the finest operator in
  Europe had done his work, and done it well. Spencer must know before he
  returned to London.</p>

  <p>From the second terror he could not escape now. Venner knew where he lived
  and the trick by which he had been deceived before. It was useless to fly
  home, seeing that that home was no longer sacred. And Venner was not far off.
  Venner had learnt something to-night that had been carefully and cunningly
  concealed from him for years.</p>

  <p>The whole thing must came out now, the secret be revealed. But from the
  first that had always been inevitable. If only it could have been postponed
  for a few weeks longer! And what would Mary say when she knew everything?</p>

  <p>A feeling of sullen despair had come over Spencer. Nothing seemed to
  matter now. Mechanically he followed in the footsteps of Stephen towards the
  house. He could see the broken glass of the conservatory, he could hear
  Venner's whining tones. Nobody could whine and fawn better than Venner when
  he pleased. The rascal had evidently met somebody that he was afraid of.</p>

  <p>Then there came the quiet, staccato tones of Von Wrangel. There was no
  suggestion of boyish triumph in his voice as there would have been had the
  operation been successful. Perhaps something had taken place to prevent it.
  With all his heart Spencer longed to know the truth. He had been hanging like
  a tramp about Stanmere when he had every right to be an honoured guest there.
  But he must satisfy himself. Stephen Gay came looming out of the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>"Your luck again," he said savagely. "It has been a failure."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say," Spencer gasped, "that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused, unable to proceed. His face was terribly agitated.</p>

  <p>"I admit your affection for the child," Gay went on; "under ordinary
  circumstances nobody would be more glad for the poor girl to get back her
  sight again. The failure has been temporary. The man you have every cause to
  fear has brought it about. I have been in the house."</p>

  <p>"You have been in the house?" Spencer asked in a dreary voice.</p>

  <p>"Well, why not? I have been in the house; I have heard everything worth
  knowing. Von Wrangel failed in consequence of the breaking of a very delicate
  instrument he was using, and he had not another one in the house. Therefore
  the operation is postponed. The noise of that smashing glass disturbed our
  German friend; hence the trouble. It was Venner blundering into one of the
  conservatories."</p>

  <p>Here was a respite. Spencer breathed more freely. Deep down in his heart
  he was execrating himself, but the fact remained that he was breathing more
  easily.</p>

  <p>"Why did Venner do that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That I can't tell you. The other fellow who was after him seems to be
  quite at home at Stanmere. By some means known to himself he has reduced
  Venner to a pitiable state of grovelling terror. But that part of the
  business does not interest me in the least. The fact remains that the
  operation is put off, and I don't mean to give you a chance to interfere.
  Come along."</p>

  <p>Spencer found breath to ask where they were going. Gay laughed.</p>

  <p>"We are going to London," he said. "For the present I have neither a local
  habitation nor a name. I am Mr. Nemo, and there are people literally
  thirsting for my blood. It sounds a little like a boy's penny novelette, but
  I know how horribly true it is. Under ordinary circumstances I should have
  left London by this time, but not now till I have seen this through. My dear
  brother, I crave your hospitality for a day or two."</p>

  <p>"It&mdash;it is quite impossible," Spencer stammered.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit if it. You have palatial quarters in Cambria Square, and I
  shall be safe there. They will never think of looking for me so near
  yourself. Kant will make me comfortable."</p>

  <p>"Kant has gone for a few days' holiday."</p>

  <p>"Well, that makes no difference. We shall be quite comfortable there.
  What! you grudge a few days' shelter and food to your one and only brother?
  Come along."</p>

  <p>The savage pleasantry of the words did not disguise the threat underlying
  them. With a weary sigh Spencer turned and followed. Across the park they
  went and out by the lodge gates without a word. It had been years since they
  were together before; perhaps they were thinking of the time when they had
  been friends and comrades, planning many a day's mischief, and dreaming
  nothing of the dark days to come. In the station they stood back from the
  feeble flare of the oil lamps, for neither desired to be recognised. As the
  train came in, three other passengers appeared. As they apparently had
  nothing to conceal, they stood where the lights fell upon them.</p>

  <p>"The dark young man accompanied by Von Wrangel and Horace Venner," Gay
  muttered. "The first two very grim with a fighting look in their eyes, and
  Venner, looking like the caged criminal in a manner that would make his
  fortune on any stage. Did you ever see a more perfect picture of a man in
  custody?"</p>

  <p>"They must not see us," Spencer said, anxiously.</p>

  <p>But Von Wrangel and his companion were too intent upon the business in
  hand to care about anybody else. As soon as the train entered the station
  Venner was bundled into a third-class carriage, and the watchers followed a
  few coaches lower down. At Victoria a four-wheeled cab was called. In the
  press of passengers Gay got near enough to hear the address.</p>

  <p>"They are going to Lincoln's Inn," he confided to Spencer. "Depend upon it
  that old fox Martlett is at the bottom of the business. I think we'd better
  have a cab, too. London streets after dark are dangerous to my health at
  present. Come along."</p>

  <p>It was late when Cambria Square was reached and the servants had retired.
  Gay looked about him curiously as if the place was familiar to him. There was
  a queer, hard smile on his face as he turned from one object of art to
  another.</p>

  <p>"You have done the thing very well," he said. "You are as artistic as the
  amateur who blacked himself all over to play Othello. So you have got about
  you all the lares and penates that belonged to me in the days of my meteoric
  prosperity? That was a happy thought."</p>

  <p>There was bitter satire in the speech, an undercurrent of savageness that
  caused Spencer to wriggle and twist on his chair. He looked unspeakably small
  and humble now, and not in the least like a master of fortunes. He had no
  reply; there was nothing to be said, only to endure the silence.</p>

  <p>"How long," he said at length, "how long&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Am I going to stay? With your fine hospitable instincts, that must be an
  exceedingly painful question to ask; but, of course, it was dictated by a
  desire for my welfare. To be perfectly candid, I don't know how long I shall
  stay. I shall be here till after that operation has been successfully
  performed. After that I should dearly like to be present when you and Mary
  meet. But even so model a specimen of humanity as myself cannot have all the
  pleasure, so I shall forego that one with Christian resignation."</p>

  <p>Stephen Gay rolled back in his chair, laughing silently. The abject misery
  of his brother's face amused him. If the man ever had a heart it had been
  cankered away long ago. He sat laughing there with his cheeks shaking and the
  tears in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Where is your boasted hospitality?" he cried. "I have not the least
  desire to eat your salt, not being partial to that class of diet; but I
  confess to a certain curiosity on the subject of your whisky and cigars. A
  delicate hint like that, my dear Paul&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Spencer placed cigars and spirits on the table. He made no effort to
  control himself; his misery had got him down and was sitting on him. He had
  found an old man of the sea, and he wondered how long the incubus would be on
  his shoulders. Gay seemed to divine his thoughts, for he laughed once more in
  that unpleasant, silent manner.</p>

  <p>"You had better ask Von Wrangel," he said. "I stay here till that is well
  over. And if you try and play me false I'll kill you. To think that a man who
  keeps whisky and cigars like this should be at heart so great a villain!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch49"
     name="ch49"></a>XLIX. &mdash; THE FIRST BLOW.</h2>

  <p>Gay was making himself quite at home. There was no trouble about the
  servants. They had merely been informed that their master's brother had
  arrived unexpectedly, and there was an end of it. As to the secret of the
  household, Kant was the only one of the domestics who knew anything, and the
  striking resemblance between Gay and his unhappy host was too apparent to
  cause speculation.</p>

  <p>There was no trouble about wardrobe, seeing that the brothers were so
  alike in figure as well as face. As Stephen appeared when he came down to
  breakfast the following morning he might have been fresh from the hands of a
  Bond street tailor. His grey lounge suit fitted him to perfection, his linen
  was glossy and immaculate, he approved of his host's razor.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful what a difference clothes make," he said. "I feel an air of
  respectability that has not been set on me for years. I feel like a county
  magistrate. No coffee, thanks. A little brandy and soda-water. You looked
  shocked. But then you are a man of domestic virtues."</p>

  <p>Spencer moved in his chair uneasily.</p>

  <p>"What do you propose to do with yourself?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Je suis, je reste. For the rest nothing. I am safe here, which is more
  than I can say of the outer air, and so long as I have plenty to read and
  smoke, I am quite content. For the next four and twenty hours I can suffer
  you out of my sight; after that I shall have to consider my position. If the
  counting-house requires attention, don't let me stand in the way."</p>

  <p>Here was a respite at any rate. It might even be possible to go as far as
  Stanmere and see Mary. But that would be better done in the evening when the
  family were at dinner. In the first place it would be necessary to find
  Martlett and gather whether he knew anything of the mysterious events of the
  previous evening in which Venner had played so strange a part. There might
  just be a possibility of getting rid of that rascal altogether. Spencer's
  breath came a little faster as he dwelt upon the desirable circumstance. If
  only it might be!</p>

  <p>At any rate, it looked as if Venner was safe for the present. He had
  evidently been more or less in custody the previous evening with captors who
  had no idea of losing him. In a frame of comparative curiosity Spencer went
  to Lincoln's Inn, but he was destined to hear nothing there beyond the fact
  that Mr. Martlett had gone to Paris.</p>

  <p>A little disappointed, Spencer went back to Cambria Square. He must know a
  little more of what had taken place at Stanmere last night. A telegram to
  Dick Stevenson would bring that about. Then Spencer went back home and
  waited.</p>

  <p>Dick came later in the afternoon. A heavy luncheon with more wine than was
  good for most people had left Gay cross and inclined to be quarrelsome.
  Finally he had fallen asleep on the sofa in the morning-room, where he looked
  like staying. What a handsome face it was still, Spencer thought, despite the
  marks of dissipation and hard living.</p>

  <p>Dick's bright cheerful features were not without their effect on Spencer.
  Dick had a good deal to say, but he was a little guarded in his manner. He
  had not forgotten his last interview with his employer, and the recollection
  of it still rankled.</p>

  <p>"Where is Von Wrangel?" Spencer asked.</p>

  <p>"I haven't the remotest idea, sir," Dick replied. "All sorts of mysterious
  things seem to be continually happening at Stanmere, till one is almost
  bewildered. It is more than strange that wherever Mary goes these mysteries
  follow. And she is so gentle and patient, the last one in the world to be
  associated with violence. But there it is."</p>

  <p>"But what has that to do with Von Wrangel?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir. Von Wrangel went away last night hurriedly with Tom
  Seymour who is engaged to my sister&mdash;and some fellow they picked up out
  of the conservatory. They were very mysterious, and I could get nothing out
  of them."</p>

  <p>Mr. Spencer crossed one foot over the other and looked out of the window.
  He did not feel like meeting Dick's direct gaze at that moment.</p>

  <p>"I am seriously annoyed with Von Wrangel," he said. "Of the sincerity of
  his motives there can be no question. But an operation like that should never
  have been attempted without my sanction."</p>

  <p>"I don't agree with you at all, sir," Dick said boldly. "You surely must
  remember&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have the best of reasons for what I said, my dear Dick, if you only
  knew how I am situated. But we need not go into that again. Tell me what
  happened."</p>

  <p>Dick explained. The operation was to be repeated again in a day or two,
  perhaps to-morrow. It all depended whether the new instrument would be in
  time or not. Spencer listened in a kind of benign satisfaction. He would be
  able to see Mary now and place his views before her. But there must be no
  delay, seeing that the operation had, after all, been partially successful,
  and delay might be dangerous.</p>

  <p>And Mary was keeping to her bed; she desired to be more or less alone. It
  was a bit of a venture, but so long as the shadow of Venner was lifted, the
  path of adventure would be comparatively smooth. Besides, Spencer had
  Stanmere by the heart. He would steal down there about nine, so that he would
  be back at the office after ten and nobody be any the wiser.</p>

  <p>"I dare say you will learn everything in time," he said, benignly. "My
  dear Dick, I am afraid that I have placed myself in a bad light before you. I
  am like a criminal who has had a heap of circumstantial evidence piled up
  against him. Then comes a prick of common sense and the whole case goes to
  the winds. If that operation is postponed it will not be
  dangerous&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It will be in embryo, Von Wrangel says," Dick replied.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" There was no keeping the relief out of the speaker's voice. "In that
  case you need not be in any hurry. Dick, do you want to go?"</p>

  <p>"I fancy I have told you everything, sir," Dick said, coldly.</p>

  <p>"As you will," Spencer replied. He felt very mean and small just for the
  moment. "I shall require you this evening at the office just before ten."</p>

  <p>Dick bowed himself out, glad to get away. His heart was not against his
  employer, and Spencer was seated with his head buried in his hands. He sat
  there until the shadows began to fall; a servant came in to lay the cloth for
  dinner. In the morning-room Stephen was stirring uneasily on the couch. He
  opened his eyes, red and bloodshot, and laughed.</p>

  <p>"Where have you been?" he cried. "You dog, if you betray me I'll kill
  you."</p>

  <p>His muddled senses had not come back to him yet. With a sudden passion
  Spencer stooped and shook him violently by the shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Take care," he said, hoarsely; "take care. But we need not brawl in the
  presence of the servants. Go to your room and cool that hot head of yours.
  Dinner is nearly ready."</p>

  <p>Gay lurched away. The dinner-bell rang but he did not appear. Spencer
  found him across his bed with a glass smelling of brandy by his side. He
  surveyed the huddled body with infinite contempt.</p>

  <p>"To think what a pair of happy pure-hearted boys we used to be," he
  muttered. "And he has come to this, and I go about in fear of my life. Well,
  he shall lie there; he probably will lie there till morning. So much the
  better for me. I shall be able to go to Stanmere and back this evening, and
  nobody the wiser."</p>

  <p>Spencer dined frugally, saying that his brother had gone to bed in
  consequence of a bad headache, and that he must not be disturbed. Then he
  threw a light dust coat over his grey morning dress, which he had not
  troubled to change, and drove to Victoria street.</p>

  <p>Fortune favoured him. There was a train now and one back at three minutes
  to ten, which would give him the best part of an hour at Stanmere. He was on
  the road now with a sense of security upon him that he had not felt for
  years. He no longer looked for enemies behind every bush or saw the
  threatening danger in every shadow.</p>

  <p>"A little time longer and it will all be over," he told himself. "There
  will be no more skulking along like a thief in the night. Was anybody
  situated like this before! Once let me get Venner out of the way
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His spirits rose at the thought. The lights of Stanmere were before him
  now. As he crept along the terrace he could see that it was the dinner hour.
  The windows of the library were open and Spencer stepped in. The hall was
  clear, too, so that he could make his way up the stairs. He knew perfectly
  well which room Mary was in. He could enter and say all he had to say and go.
  Really, the thing was most absurdly easy after all. Mary was&mdash;</p>

  <p>He paused. Mary stood there in the corridor. She seemed to fall; she
  clapped her hands to her eyes and called out. It appeared as if she really
  could see. There was a rustling from the hall as Spencer sprang down the
  stairs and into the black throat of the night again by the way that he had
  come..... He stood there panting, sick and dizzy for the moment.</p>

  <p>"It is to be," he gasped. "I can't fight against a fate like mine."</p>

  <p>The presses were gathering up steam in the Record office, the chief of the
  great paper sat quietly in his office as if he had come down like any other
  respectable citizen straight after his dinner. There were no traces of a
  recent adventure about him. He was giving Dick some directions in his most
  clear and lucid manner.</p>

  <p>"I fancy that is all," he said. "Well, what is it, Mr. Fisher?"</p>

  <p>The editor came in with some copy in his hand. He looked annoyed and angry
  with somebody.</p>

  <p>"The most astounding thing," he said. "Really, sir, you will have to get
  rid of Irvine. I am afraid he has been drinking again. He has just come in
  with a report that you, you, sir, have been nearly done to death in your own
  bedroom in Cambria Square. When I told him you were here he said that he had
  seen the body, that the police were already on the track of the would-be
  assassin."</p>

  <p>"And it's the truth," a protesting voice in the doorway said. "If Mr.
  Spencer is here&mdash;oh, Heavens, I'm mad. I'll never touch a drop of
  anything again. And yet I could swear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The reporter paused, and his own white face was reflected by the deadly
  pallor of Spencer's features. The latter turned to Dick helplessly.</p>

  <p>"Dear lad," he whispered. "Try and think for me. It's one of my mental
  attacks. My mind has quite gone for a moment."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch50"
     name="ch50"></a>L. &mdash; FIXING THE TIME.</h2>

  <p>Spencer turned and looked from one to the other of the excited group in
  the most benign manner. It was quite clear that he was outside himself for
  the moment. It was equally true that the reporter Irvine was speaking from
  personal knowledge.</p>

  <p>"It's real enough," he said, with a gasp. "I didn't know Mr. Spencer was
  here, so I was going to call upon him at Cambria Square. He helps me
  sometimes."</p>

  <p>"Not worth mentioning, Irvine," Spencer said, coming back to himself with
  a start. The benign look had faded from his face, leaving a stony terror
  behind. "Well!"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I heard one of the servants yell out something about murder.
  She was standing by a bedroom door, and I looked in. There was a commotion
  somewhere downstairs and a policeman came up. And there on the bed I
  saw&mdash;I saw&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Irvine paused. Fisher jogged his elbow impatiently.</p>

  <p>"I saw Mr. Spencer," the reporter gasped. "I would have sworn to him
  anywhere. And yet it can't be, because there is Mr. Spencer before me. . . .
  I can't make it out."</p>

  <p>Dick stood there quietly waiting for his employer to speak.</p>

  <p>Spencer's lips were twitching horribly, but no sound came from them.</p>

  <p>"Can't you tell us anything, sir?" Dick urged.</p>

  <p>"Better get back home," Spencer forced himself to say at last. "I fear,
  very much fear, that Irvine is not entirely wrong. I might have expected
  something like this?"</p>

  <p>He pushed his way out of the office like a blind man, closely followed by
  Dick. He would have nobody else. Fisher and Irvine had their own work to do.
  Out in Fleet street Spencer turned and placed himself entirely in Dick's
  hands.</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake tell me what to do," he said. "I am absolutely dazed.
  Act for yourself. The truth can no longer be concealed."</p>

  <p>Dick settled the matter by calling the first hansom that passed. They
  found a small knot of people excitedly discussing what they knew of the
  mystery in Cambria Square. Mr. Spencer, the great newspaper proprietor and
  philanthropist had been foully murdered in his bedroom by some miscreant who
  had succeeded in making his escape. It was fortunate that none of the crowd
  recognised Spencer as he pushed through.</p>

  <p>Two policemen in uniform and a plainclothes inspector had taken possession
  of the flat. They had got all they could out of the frightened servants when
  Spencer entered. He was still very pale and agitated, but he was himself
  now.</p>

  <p>"And who may you be, sir?" the inspector asked. "Why, bless my soul,
  I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused, astonished, as well he might; making due allowance for physical
  changes, the inspector seemed to be speaking to the very man that he had left
  in extremis in the next room.</p>

  <p>"I am Mr. Spencer," was the reply. "Can I do anything for you?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed you can, sir. Will you please come this way? I daresay it will be
  quite simple when the matter is explained, but up to the present I am
  puzzled. I can make nothing of the servants, who seem to have lost their wits
  altogether."</p>

  <p>Spencer, followed by Dick, entered the bedroom where the outrage had taken
  place. Stephen Gay lay on the bed there, his face turned upwards, and
  apparently dead. From the left breast a little red moisture oozed.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's the man in the square," Dick cried, "it's the man who tried to
  kill you the night that you and I first met, sir."</p>

  <p>The inspector started. He was getting to something definite at last. Dick
  realised his indiscretion. Goodness only knows what mischief he had done. But
  there lay the very man who played so strange a part in that night adventure
  in Cambria Square a few weeks ago.</p>

  <p>"This man has been found thus in your rooms, sir," the inspector said.
  "Will you be good enough to tell us, in the first place, who he is?"</p>

  <p>It was a long time before Spencer made any reply. His gaze slowly
  travelled round the room to the face of the dead man, and then slowly back
  again to the Inspector. He appeared to be pre-occupied. The policeman asked
  the question again sharply.</p>

  <p>"He was my brother," Spencer said quietly. "You have only to look at the
  likeness to see that."</p>

  <p>The Inspector nodded. So far the ground was clear enough. That the living
  and the dead were brothers, nobody could possibly doubt. But there was bad
  blood between them. The young man who had come in with Mr. Spencer seemed to
  know all about that.</p>

  <p>"I think we had better sit down and talk it over, gentlemen," the
  Inspector suggested. "My name is Ridgway; I am sorry, but my duty is very
  plain. This gentleman here&mdash;thank you, sir&mdash;Mr. Stevenson,
  suggested just now that there was bad blood between the parties. He said
  something about the poor gentleman in the next room and an attempt to
  murder."</p>

  <p>"I have no recollection of it," Spencer said, fervently.</p>

  <p>Dick sat there moodily silent. But for his outburst that point would never
  have come to light. But he had been startled out of himself for the moment.
  And what Spencer said was quite correct. He had quite forgotten that eventful
  night in the square. Dick recollected the strategy he had been compelled to
  use to find his employer's address. And when they met the next day in the
  Record office Mr. Spencer did not recognise him in the least.</p>

  <p>"I am waiting for you to speak, sir," Ridgway said, pointedly.</p>

  <p>"If you know anything, do not conceal it," Spencer said, in a shaking
  voice. "There has been misery enough already over the concealment of facts.
  Don't get yourself into trouble, Dick."</p>

  <p>Dick told his story. Ridgway listened with critical interest, Spencer in
  blank astonishment. He was hearing all this for the first time. Not that he
  doubted the truth of it for a moment, for he was quite alive to his own
  mental lapses. Even now it was as if Dick were recalling some almost
  forgotten dream. Ridgway looked very grave.</p>

  <p>"This is a very awkward business," he said. "If you like to say anything,
  Mr. Spencer, you may. On the whole, I should recommend that you consult your
  solicitor."</p>

  <p>"In other words, you suspect me of the crime," Spencer said. "As I am
  absolutely innocent as a child, I have nothing to conceal. You want to know
  if there was bad blood between my brother and myself. In reply to that I may
  tell you I went in fear of my life. He gave me fair warning that he would
  kill me if he could. And at one time he would have kept his word."</p>

  <p>"One moment, sir," Ridgway interrupted. "What do you mean by the
  expression 'at one time'?"</p>

  <p>"I mean that my brother quite recently changed his mind. I don't mean that
  he changed his views or anything of that kind, but he made a discovery by
  means of which he could torture and frighten me in such a way that a threat
  of vengeance had no terrors by comparison. He found me out, and told me so
  quite callously. He was the kind of man to enjoy that kind of thing. He
  proposed to take up his quarters with me so that he could see the sport, as
  he called it, and I had to bow to his wishes."</p>

  <p>"And this little scheme of revenge, sir?" Ridgway suggested.</p>

  <p>"Is part of my secret, and has nothing to do with the case," Spencer said
  firmly. "For years I have been at work on a certain plan which is very near
  success. What it is, and what desperate expedient I had to resort to in order
  to bring it about will never be known to the public or yourself&mdash;which
  is much the same thing. That desperate expedient is the cause of the whole
  trouble. But I am going to say nothing about that. As to the rest, I am quite
  prepared to speak freely."</p>

  <p>Ridgway shrugged his shoulders significantly.</p>

  <p>"As you will," he said. "But all this mystery is slightly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Harmful to myself. Quite so. Well, my brother came here yesterday. He was
  penniless and desperate, his only possession being a silver watch worth a few
  shillings&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know that, sir. I shall have something to say about that watch
  presently. Go on&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I told the servants that my brother had come home unexpectedly from
  abroad. It was one of the little fictions that people use on these occasions.
  I found him in clothes. His stay, I gathered, was indefinite. He had
  breakfast and luncheon to-day, at which meal he had far too much wine. He
  went to dress for dinner, and, I presume, had some brandy in his room, for he
  was fast asleep on the bed. It was the last time I saw him alive. I had my
  own dinner and went out, and that is all I know."</p>

  <p>"You had some sort of a quarrel, didn't you?" Ridgway asked. "Didn't you
  say to the deceased, or didn't he say to you, that he would kill you if you
  betrayed him?</p>

  <p>"I believe there was something of the kind," Spencer admitted,
  thoughtfully. "My brother said that. I cut him short because the servants
  were within hearing. As soon as I dined I went out."</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me what time you went out?"</p>

  <p>"It was about half-past eight. I had a little private business to do that
  took me an hour or more, and then I took a cab as far as the Record office. I
  was not back at the house in the meantime, and I heard nothing of the affair
  until it was told me by one of my own reporters. If there is any chance of
  fixing the time of the murder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That has been done for us," Ridgway interrupted. "The crime was committed
  at twenty-eight minutes past nine exactly. There is no doubt about that."</p>

  <p>Spencer nodded. His mind was far away for the moment. At the hour
  mentioned by Ridgway with such positive assurance he was standing in the
  corridor at Stanmere, watching Mary in her white gown, and the gleam of her
  golden hair on her shoulders. Perhaps there was a way out of it yet, but the
  publicity could not be avoided now.</p>

  <p>"How did you fix the time so exactly?" Dick asked.</p>

  <p>Ridgway took a parcel carefully from his pocket. He opened it and laid on
  the table before him a silver watch that had apparently been damaged by some
  accident.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Spencer was just saying that his brother had nothing in the world but
  a silver watch worth a few shillings," he said. "This is the watch. I took it
  out of the dead man's watch pocket to-night&mdash;the pocket on the left side
  over his heart. You can see where the assassin's knife shivered the glass and
  the cheap flimsy works on its way to the heart, so great was the force of the
  blow. I find that the watch is more or less fully wound, and appears to be in
  going order. The hands stopped at twenty-eight minutes past nine, which seems
  to me conclusive evidence as to the hour of the crime."</p>

  <p>Then there was no more to be said on that point. Dick turned to Mr.
  Spencer.</p>

  <p>"The Inspector is doing no more than his duty," he said. "At the same time
  it is utterly ridiculous to imagine that Mr. Spencer had anything to do with
  the deed of violence. I am aware that he has admitted that there was bad
  blood between his brother and himself."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," Ridgway said significantly. "It was you who brought
  that out, sir."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I did," Dick said, a little abashed. "But it would have been my
  plain duty to do so in any case. It seems to me that the watch is going to
  save us a great deal of trouble. Putting aside the absurd suggestion that a
  man would have lured his brother under his own roof to make away with him, we
  have the important question of time settled. Mr. Spencer, will you tell
  Inspector Ridgway where you were at about half-past nine to-night?"</p>

  <p>Spencer looked up vaguely. His mind had gone wandering off in quite
  another direction. It was some little time before he caught the full
  significance of the question. At that very minute he had been at Stanmere.
  But there were reasons why he could not say so, reasons why he could not
  prove it. And in any case it did not make matters better for him.</p>

  <p>"I was engaged on exceedingly private personal business," he said.</p>

  <p>"But surely you can well prove an alibi," Dick cried, "it could not have
  been business of so private a nature that you could not bring witnesses to
  prove that."</p>

  <p>Spencer shook his head in a kind of bland obstinacy.</p>

  <p>"I can say nothing," he said. "My lips are sealed. I utterly decline to
  say more."</p>

  <p>Inspector Ridgway picked up the watch and restored it to his pocket. He
  had no more questions to ask for the present. They would keep for the inquest
  to-morrow. Meanwhile he had locked and sealed up the room where the dead man
  lay. Dick waited for his companion to speak; perhaps Spencer would confide in
  him. But he sat there looking into the fire, and when Dick ventured to speak
  he bid him hastily to hold his tongue and go away.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch51"
     name="ch51"></a>LI. &mdash; AN EYE-WITNESS.</h2>

  <p>Von Wrangel came down to Stanmere by the early train with a fresh set of
  instruments in his pocket and the firm resolve that to-night should see his
  operation successfully through. He burst into the breakfast-room at
  Shepherd's Spring to find Molly having breakfast alone.</p>

  <p>"Where is Dick?" he demanded. "Command the sluggard to leave his bed
  immediately."</p>

  <p>Molly explained that Dick had not come back from London the previous
  night. Tom had gone off to town on some mysterious errand and Molly was left
  entirely alone.</p>

  <p>"I am most melancholy," she said. "Actually I am reading the paper at
  breakfast, a thing that I never remember doing in my life before. You shall
  take me for a walk presently, Baron. After that you shall go and cure Mary,
  and we shall live together happily ever after. Why, what is this?"</p>

  <p>Molly put her untasted coffee down and stared at the paper with vivid
  interest. Von Wrangel watched her with a smile. Something to do with the
  fashions, he thought.</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary!" Molly cried. "There has been a man murdered at the flat
  of Mr. Spencer in Cambria Square. At first it was thought it was Mr. Spencer
  himself, but it turns out to have been his brother. It appears that there is
  a most amazing likeness between them. Murdered in bed, Baron, and nobody
  knows who did it. When Mr. Spencer was out the assassin actually crept into
  the bedroom and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Give it me," Von Wrangel said hoarsely. "Give it me. I&mdash;I beg your
  pardon, but this is really dreadful. Lady Stanmere must know of this."</p>

  <p>"How can it interest her?" Molly asked.</p>

  <p>"Because that dead man is her son Stephen, and Mr. Spencer, as you call
  him, is Paul Gay, Lord Stanmere. You would have found all this out in time,
  so there is no reason to conceal the truth any longer."</p>

  <p>Molly murmured her astonishment. Things were growing bright very
  swiftly.</p>

  <p>"Then the mysterious stranger in Cambria Square was Mr. Spencer's own
  brother," she cried. "But you know nothing of that, so I had better tell you
  Dick's strange adventure....... Now you understand. But why did Stephen Gay
  have such a deadly hatred of his brother?"</p>

  <p>"For one thing, because he fancied Paul had betrayed him to some enemies
  of his. But there is another reason that I cannot tell you yet. If Dick tells
  the story of that amazing meeting in Cambria Square to the police, as he is
  bound to do, there will be trouble for Paul Spencer. It will be pretty sure
  to connect him with the crime."</p>

  <p>"But he could not possibly have done anything so dreadful!"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. How these two men came to be under the same roof baffles
  me. It is quite the strangest part of a strange story. If necessary, I shall
  have to speak."</p>

  <p>"Baron," Molly cried. "I believe you could say something of the mystery.
  There is a look in your eyes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course I could. I know the actual criminal. Do you recollect that
  night when we saw those strange men in the Warren? They were members of a
  secret society and they were after Stephen Gay. He had betrayed the cause
  they had belonged to most dishonourably. For years they have been seeking
  him. More than once I saved his life, but he was so desperate and reckless. I
  might have saved him now had he only followed my instructions. But these men
  were untiring as they were remorseless. They had their work to do, and they
  went about it in a fashion all their own."</p>

  <p>"But if you had put the police upon their track&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Quite useless. You see I knew these men, and that gave me an advantage.
  If I had scattered them, their places would have been taken by others not
  personally familiar to me, and my task would have been doubled. Well, they
  have got the best of me, and the vendetta is ended."</p>

  <p>"It is very dreadful for Lady Stanmere," Molly said sadly.</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel, in his innermost heart, was not so sure of that. Lady
  Stanmere knew that the blow must fall some time; the sword had been hanging
  over her head for years. She was sitting in the drawing-room over her
  everlasting knitting as Von Wrangel came in. She gave one glance at him and
  her hands fell in her lap.</p>

  <p>"Tell me all about it," she said. "I see that it has happened at
  last."</p>

  <p>"I shall never make a diplomatist," Von Wrangel murmured. "My dear lady,
  you know how deeply I feel for you. And yet, and yet, it was inevitable. I
  have brought a paper over so that you may read for yourself. There is an
  extraordinary complication here."</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere felt for her glasses with trembling hands, but outwardly she
  was quite calm. This was but another drop in the full measure or her sorrows,
  but Mary was left. It was her balm of consolation. She read the whole long
  report with a seeming calm that aroused Von Wrangel's admiration.</p>

  <p>"It is an extraordinary case altogether," Lady Stanmere said, alter a long
  pause. "Of course the Mr. Spencer is my son Paul. I deemed him to be dead
  long ago. I began to imagine that he was a kind of guardian, but really my
  head is quite confused. What manner of man is Paul?"</p>

  <p>"He is rich and respected," Von Wrangel explained. "My dear lady, there is
  a complication here that even you have no knowledge of as yet. Perhaps, on
  the whole, I had better leave the proper person to tell you. But it is pretty
  sure that Paul will be accused of his brother's murder."</p>

  <p>"But that in too horrible," Lady Stanmere cried. "We know better."</p>

  <p>"Of course we do, and I shall be able to explain if necessary. Still, if
  there are no traces to be found of Hengel and the rest, my story will be
  regarded with suspicion and ridicule. And the worst of the whole thing is, we
  cannot avoid the scandal that has for so long hung over this house. If Paul
  is charged by the police, the whole thing must come out."</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere bowed her head wearily.</p>

  <p>"If it must, it must," she said. "The wild blood in the race is bound to
  assert itself. I have carried so many sorrows that one more makes no
  difference. Still, it is good to know that one of my boys, at any rate, has
  come back to the path of honour again."</p>

  <p>"Paul was never more than wild and headstrong," Von Wrangel said,
  thoughtfully. "And his father turned him out of the house, you remember. You
  are going to be proud of him yet. When he comes back to you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He will never come back to me. After all these years&mdash;oh! it is
  impossible. Von Wrangel, the matter must be concealed from Mary for the
  present."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel was of the same opinion. He wondered what Mary would think
  when the whole truth came to be told, as told it must be before long.</p>

  <p>"She will be brave enough," he said. "And yet there is a thing here as
  obvious as the dazzling conjuring tricks when once they are explained. As to
  the other matter, you may simply leave it in my hands. I should very much
  like to see my patient."</p>

  <p>Mary was having her breakfast in her room and would be down presently. She
  came after a time very quiet and subdued, but with a pleasant smile on her
  face that was good to see. Von Wrangel crossed over and gave her an
  encouraging pat on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You are a marvel of patience," he said. "Many patients would have given
  their nurses no end of trouble. But there are only a few hours more to wait.
  And when you can see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear, kind doctor," Mary said quietly. "I can see now."</p>

  <p>She made the remark in an even tone of voice, with just a touch of
  gladness in it. Lady Stanmere had folded up her knitting and crept quietly
  from the room. Just for an instant Von Wrangel had glared uneasily at his
  patient, but there was no cause for alarm.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" he asked. "Speak freely; we are quite
  alone."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I heard my grandmother leave the room. It was last night as I lay in
  bed with nobody near. I wanted to be alone you see, because my thoughts were
  pleasant and I liked to have them all to myself. It was about dinner-time,
  and I fancied I heard my father calling to me. I got out of bed and went into
  the corridor. I fell over something and the bandage slipped from my eyes. And
  then I saw the corridor quite plainly with the eye that you have operated
  upon, and I saw my father looking the same, and yet so different from the
  time when last I had seen him. He seemed so good and so noble, and his eyes
  were shining; the old fear was gone from his face. . . . And then I cried
  out, and he vanished, and others came, and I said nothing for fear it was
  fancy. But it was not fancy, I am sure that I was not dreaming."</p>

  <p>There was a queer, tense expression on Von Wrangel's face.</p>

  <p>"How was your father dressed?" he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"In a grey suit, with a red tie," Mary said promptly. "But what struck me
  was the wonderful change in him; he was softened and improved. If only I had
  not called out!"</p>

  <p>"Had you any idea what time it was?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes. The chimes of the big corridor clock struck the quarter after
  nine just before I heard the voice calling to me. I recollect that
  distinctly."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel nodded. All this coincided with what he had hoped for and
  expected. And Paul Spencer often dressed in grey, with a red tie. The little
  German's expression changed to a look of pain, a dread of giving pain to
  others.</p>

  <p>"I am going to test you," he said, "and test you again in the presence of
  credible witnesses. Now, let me remove the bandage from the eye that has been
  under my care for a few moments. You are to look at the table and tell me
  what you see there. It is only to be for an instant."</p>

  <p>He removed the bandage, and replaced it after the lapse of a few moments.
  Mary smiled.</p>

  <p>"Flowers," she said. "A great bunch of flowers, of early chrysanthemums,
  and a few letters and some coloured silks plaited into a kind of skein. And
  there is old Williams trimming the lawn. What do you think of that?"</p>

  <p>"I think it is wonderful," Von Wrangel said unsteadily. "Let me try again.
  Now, once more. Now."</p>

  <p>They tried again and again with every kind of success. Finally Von Wrangel
  replaced the bandage for good and all. His fingers trembled slightly.</p>

  <p>"We will repeat that this afternoon," he said. "And now, my dear young
  lady, I am going to ask you a great favour. Would you mind my not finishing
  my operation for a few days. It may seem strange to you, but the mere fact of
  the postponement may be the means of conferring a lasting benefit upon one
  who is very dear to you."</p>

  <p>Mary hesitated, but only for a moment. Then she smiled.</p>

  <p>"More mystery," she said, "and yet more mystery. My dear, good, kind
  doctor, I would make any sacrifice for those I love."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch52"
     name="ch52"></a>LII. &mdash; SCOTCHED.</h2>

  <p>Three candles in a silver branch sufficed to make a spot of light in the
  dingy sitting-room where Martlett spent his evenings. Half buried in an
  armchair, he was poring over some old black-letter manuscript, the text of
  which puzzled him. Next to his delight in finding things out, Martlett most
  liked to be puzzled.</p>

  <p>He had been digging at intricate cases until he was as rusty as a village
  sexton, and yet, after all these years of delving and burrowing into the old
  manuscripts and old deeds, the keenness of his clear eyes was not dimmed in
  the slightest. He was beaten for the moment now; he placed the book on his
  knee to think the matter out.</p>

  <p>A servant as old and dried up as himself came in with the information that
  somebody had come to see him on pressing business. Before he could frame an
  excuse Von Wrangel came in, followed by Seymour. There was a slight frown on
  Martlett's face.</p>

  <p>"No use looking like that," Von Wrangel said. "You can put your
  black-letters up for to-night, you old fox. What have we here? An hour book
  by Elzar of 1594. A second impression."</p>

  <p>"It isn't a second impression at all," Martlett said tartly. "Much you
  know about it. That is a first impression if ever I saw one. I picked it up
  in Drury Lane Court, and I wouldn't take a hundred pounds for it at this
  moment."</p>

  <p>"There is no border on the title page," Von Wrangel retorted.</p>

  <p>The argument waxed warm. Seymour coughed suggestively. Von Wrangel came to
  earth again.</p>

  <p>"Some day I will show you," he said. "Meanwhile to business. Being so fine
  a business man myself, I should be ashamed to be led away. This is my friend
  Mr. Seymour&mdash;Mr. Martlett, the eminent lawyer. Do you see the
  candelabra, Seymour. It has the first James letter and the London hallmark,
  and a millionaire collector offered Martlett two thousand pounds for it. Ah,
  there are worse things than being an old family lawyer."</p>

  <p>"Infinitely worse," Martlett said dryly. "To have an uncontrollable
  tongue, for instance."</p>

  <p>"True," said Von Wrangel, not in the least, annoyed. "Now let us to our
  muttons. I have caught a specimen to-night, Martlett. Attracted by the light,
  he flew into the small conservatory at Stanmere. My young friend here can
  identify him. In other words, I have Horace Venner by the heels, and Seymour
  says he knows enough to hang him."</p>

  <p>Martlett nodded. He had forgotten all about his black-letters by this
  time.</p>

  <p>"You have met the man before?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Seymour explained. "I found him outside the terrace at
  Stanmere to-night. I was waiting for my friends the Stevensons, and I struck
  a light for my cigarette. That fellow, for some reason or another, was hiding
  close by. I saw his face clearly as he saw mine. He bolted with sheer terror,
  and I after him. I caught him in the small conservatory."</p>

  <p>"At the moment I was conducting my operation," Von Wrangel struck in. "The
  noise quite startled me, and I partially failed."</p>

  <p>"No serious damage, I hope?" Martlett asked, with unusual eagerness.</p>

  <p>"Not at all. I do not fail. It is all a matter of time. I have to wait for
  another instrument, and the thing is done. Go on, my young friend."</p>

  <p>"I came face to face with that man," Seymour resumed. "There could be no
  possible disguise any longer. I could hang that fellow."</p>

  <p>"You could prove a murder against him?" Martlett asked.</p>

  <p>"Assuredly, given time and the aid of the San Francisco police. I kept my
  man there until I could send for Von Wrangel; I told him what I have told
  you, and he seems to think that you would be glad of this information."</p>

  <p>Martlett winked once or twice swiftly. His eyes were gleaming with an
  eager light. Von Wrangel was regarding him curiously.</p>

  <p>"But why do you suggest that I could use this information?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Because I know everything, old fox," Von Wrangel cried. "I discovered it
  for myself. Talk about being blind, why there is nobody blinder than myself.
  What was Paul Spencer, otherwise Paul Gay, so fearful of besides being in the
  power of someone who knew some shameful secret of his? And who might that
  blackmailer be better than his old valet, the rascal Venner? And how to
  hoodwink Venner? Oh, it was a great plan, old fox, and reflected great credit
  on you. Stephen was out of the way."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," Martlett said stiffly. "It was no suggestion of
  mine."</p>

  <p>"Of course not. All you could do was to show its possibility. And when
  your client said he had half a mind to try it, you gravely warned him of the
  risks. I understand."</p>

  <p>A ghost of a smile hovered round Martlett's lips for a moment.</p>

  <p>"All this is beside the point," he said. "We will admit, for the sake of
  argument, that my client, Paul Spencer, or Gay, as you please, desired to
  keep Venner at arm's length. He may or may not have adopted a neat and
  ingenious plan to do so. At any rate, we want to stop that fellow's mouth. If
  you can show us a way to do so, we shall be exceedingly grateful."</p>

  <p>"I am here for that purpose," Seymour said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Good! Where is the interesting specimen alluded to?"</p>

  <p>"At present he is locked up on your confidential clerk's office," Von
  Wrangel said. "He cannot possibly get out of the window, which is a skylight,
  and the door is lined with iron. Besides, I don't think that the fellow would
  do so if he could, he is in such a pitiable state of collapse. I have told my
  young friend, Seymour, certain points of the case, and he tells me he is in a
  position to keep Venner's mouth shut for all time."</p>

  <p>"I am quite certain of it," Seymour said. "But I am going to ask you one
  question, Mr. Martlett. Was that little indiscretion of your client's
  connected with San Francisco?"</p>

  <p>Martlett wriggled uneasily on his chair. All this was very irregular to
  the strictly trained legal mind that specially abhors anything in the way of
  leading questions. Von Wrangel burst out impetuously. His was no game of
  judicial chess to be played out over a course of sittings.</p>

  <p>"Come out of the hole, old fox," he cried; "come out of the hole. You are
  going to be astonished presently. We can't scotch this snake unless you help
  us a bit. Was it San Francisco?"</p>

  <p>"It was," Martlett admitted. "But really, gentlemen, I must
  protest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Against the betraying of a client's confidence, eh?" Von Wrangel
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"There was a quarrel over some accounts, and revolvers were produced. The
  man on the other side was a notorious bully, and, moreover, had a bad repute.
  He got the worst of that encounter, and was shot by Paul Gay, who left him
  for dead in his tent. Is that a fact?"</p>

  <p>Martlett nodded as if the information had been extracted from him like a
  tooth by an unskilful dentist. It was very irregular indeed.</p>

  <p>"I think I had better take up the case here," Seymour said. "There had
  been a great deal of violence in San Francisco for some time owing to some
  very bitter strikes and the like. It was a time when every man had to look to
  himself. If Gay had not shot down Miller, Miller would have killed him. There
  was a third partner, who was away at the time&mdash;a man named Maxwell."</p>

  <p>Martlett nodded again. This was decidedly interesting.</p>

  <p>"Maxwell was a great friend of Gay. The vigilance committee was after Gay,
  who fled with the crime of murder on his soul. Miller was dead, and a bit of
  gold dust he had about him had been stolen. This is the secret Venner holds,
  and upon which he would have traded heavily, only your ingenious
  plan&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;prevented him. Venner had not long been
  discharged from the employ of Mr. Paul Gay, and he wanted revenge. Then began
  the game of hide-and-seek, which has not finished yet. Correct me if I am
  wrong."</p>

  <p>"I deny nothing," Martlett said, still cautiously. "Let us assume that
  everything is correct. But you have not shown me yet how to get Venner out of
  the way."</p>

  <p>"I am coming to that part presently," Seymour went on. "I want my friend
  Maxwell, for whom I worked some years, to be present. Maxwell is in Paris at
  the Invalides hotel. If he were here now he would absolutely rehabilitate the
  character of your client."</p>

  <p>"You mean that he might find some loophole for escape? Perhaps the
  American laws&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Laws have nothing to do with it," Seymour said, with some sign of
  impatience. "Maxwell will be able to prove that your client has absolutely
  nothing to fear. I can go further than that, and say that your client is
  absolutely innocent. If Maxwell were here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Martlett rose to his feet excitedly.</p>

  <p>"I have not another word of protest to make," he said. "You have been
  right from the first, and I am wrong. But you must not lose sight of Venner.
  It is imperative that that rascal should be kept safe. There are interests at
  stake here far greater than you imagine. If I could see Mr. Maxwell, am I at
  liberty to repeat all that you have said?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Seymour asked. "The story must be made public some time."</p>

  <p>"Then I go to Paris in the morning," Martlett declared. "I will go and see
  your friend Maxwell, and I hope to induce him to return with me to England.
  My dear sir, it is impossible to over-estimate the importance of what you
  have told me to-night. I have not been quite so wise over the business as I
  had imagined."</p>

  <p>"The same as the black-letter manuscript," Von Wrangel chuckled.</p>

  <p>Martlett ignored the challenge. There was an air of excitement about him
  quite foreign to the man. He paced up and down the room scratching his dry
  chin and muttering to himself. Finally he came up standing and turned to
  Seymour.</p>

  <p>"You have a very slippery man to deal with," he said. "If he gives you the
  go-by&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He won't," Seymour said coolly. "I shall know how to deal with him. I
  shall send him away to-night to the kennel where he lives with the absolute
  certainty that he will come to me when I whistle for him in the morning. I
  can hang the man; I can hold that in terror over him. We have Venner quite
  safe. It was only to please Von Wrangel that we went through the farce of
  locking him up in your clerk's room."</p>

  <p>"Then go and send him off," Von Wrangel suggested.</p>

  <p>Seymour went off in the direction of the outer office. Venner was perched
  on a high stool, a picture of the most hopeless, abject misery. His white
  soddened face was quivering with terror; he had bitten his nails down in a
  grinding, mechanical way during the half-hour that had seemed to him a small
  eternity. He looked up fawningly in Seymour's face.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with me?" he whined.</p>

  <p>"For the present, nothing," Seymour replied. "You need not look so
  pleased. I am going to let you go on the condition that you come here every
  morning at 10 o'clock to report yourself and to see if your presence here is
  needed. If you serve us faithfully and well, I shall hold my hand. You did
  the world a service by ridding it of a scoundrel, so that I do not feel any
  trouble on the score of justice. But if you play me false, by nightfall
  everything shall be in the hands of the police. Now you can go."</p>

  <p>Venner looked up with abject amazement. He did not seem to grasp the
  meaning of it all. He was free to depart without further questions being
  asked. These people meant to let him down easily. If he could only go
  straight and tell the truth for once!</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say that I am free to&mdash;to&mdash;" he stammered.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I desire to convey to your intelligence. Go! Be off!
  Don't pollute the air that honest men breathe any longer. And if you fail to
  keep your part of the bond&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Venner broke out into a torrent of protestations. By all that he held most
  sacred he would not do anything of the kind. He would do anything in the
  world that Mr. Seymour required. He crept out of the house and down the
  street in a curiously ill-balanced frame of mind. He looked like saving his
  rascally skin, but at the same time he saw that once glittering fortune
  disappearing into the future. He had built up the most extravagant plans on
  that.</p>

  <p>"You have got rid of him?" Martlett asked.</p>

  <p>Seymour explained carelessly what had happened. Venner was to report
  himself daily, and he had not the slightest doubt that he would not fail to
  do so. Martlett nodded, helped himself to a rarely-smoked second cigar, and
  plunged into the pages of Bradshaw.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch53"
     name="ch53"></a>LIII. &mdash; CAUSE CELÈBRE.</h2>

  <p>The Cambria Square murder was at once recognised as material for a great
  sensation. There had been more vulgar crimes and more mysterious ones, but
  there was here all the making of the kind of drama that the soul of the
  modern journalist loves.</p>

  <p>In the first place Mr. Paul Spencer had been more or less a fascinating
  personage. He was supposed to have laid the nucleus of his fortune abroad; he
  had come back to England, where he was at once established as a great
  philanthropist of the best kind. He was the sort of man who did good by
  stealth, and blushed to find it fame. His peculiarities were dwelt
  upon&mdash;his passion for privacy, the fact that most people outside his own
  household were only allowed to see him in the semi-darkness, all were told in
  the newspaper tale. There was something strange about the man.</p>

  <p>The poetic side was supplied by his absolute devotion to his blind
  daughter. Then again, there was the fact that he had a brother exactly like
  himself. Then came the still more startling discovery that Mr. Paul Spencer
  was really Mr. Paul Gay, or, in other words Lord Stanmere, the only remaining
  son of the eccentric peer of that name who had committed suicide after
  becoming entangled in some cheap political conspiracy inspired by a foreign
  league of patriots.</p>

  <p>Why, therefore, had the man hidden his identity and lived at Cambria
  Square, when be might have taken possession of a splendid property and become
  a man of the country? People recalled to mind the fact that there had been a
  second Gay who had brought a good deal of scandal on the family name and had
  subsequently disappeared altogether.</p>

  <p>Of course, the murdered man was the missing brother. People who had known
  the family long ago were hunted up by busy reporters, and forgotten facts
  dragged to light. The amazing resemblance between the brothers was commented
  on, and as a problem the mystery was solved. All the same, people waited for
  the inquest with breathless interest. The whole truth would have to come out
  then.</p>

  <p>And Paul Spencer would have to drag himself out into the light of day.
  With the broad glare of publicity upon him, it was hopeless to expect to hide
  from Venner any longer. Everything would have to be laid bare, and the work
  of his life absolutely ruined.</p>

  <p>Worst of all, he had nobody to fall back upon. Von Wrangel seemed to have
  disappeared upon one of his erratic, mysterious errands, and Martlett had
  gone to Paris leaving no word behind as to where he was to be found, or when
  he would come back to London again.</p>

  <p>There was only Dick, and he had been subpoenaed to give evidence at the
  inquest, which would merely tend to make the police case against Spencer
  blacker still. Dick remained the night at Cambria Square, and did his best to
  keep up the drooping spirits of his companions.</p>

  <p>But to the man of vivid imagination the anticipation of trouble is always
  greater than the realisation. At the end of the second day's examination
  Spencer felt as if the bitterness of death were past. In the light of his own
  evidence he only wondered why no warrant had been applied for his arrest. But
  the inquiry would be closed on the morrow, and then the blow would fall.</p>

  <p>On the whole, the police would have been justified. There was a blood
  feud, or something like it, between the two brothers. Dick had seen part of
  the drama enacted, and his evidence told greatly against the man who, in the
  eye of the public, was already on his trial on the capital charge. Spencer
  had elected to give evidence, much against the wish of the coroner, and he
  only succeeded in making bad worse. There had been a long feud between the
  dead man and himself. His brother had come to Cambria Square, where he had
  not been invited. He had got possession of a certain secret, but what that
  secret was the witness declined to say. They had quarrelled in the flat and
  the witness had gone out soon after that. Pressed to say where he had been,
  he declined to make any statement. That was no business of anybody's but his
  own, and he refused to go any further. There was no pretence at an alibi. The
  conclusion came to by the listeners was that Spencer had never left the house
  at all.</p>

  <p>He finished his evidence at last; he looked fearfully round the court as
  if he expected to meet the eye of Horace Venner; not that it much mattered,
  not that anything much mattered now. He only wanted to get home again. The
  scandal had come at last, but not at all in the way that it had been
  expected. Scandals seldom do.</p>

  <p>The story was reaching far and wide. It had got down to Stanmere, where it
  was studied as eagerly in the servants' hall as it was in the drawing-room.
  Goss was the only one who did not seem in the least astonished. But he knew
  certain facts concealed from the rest of the domestic staff.</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere read the evidence with mixed feelings. It was a sorry ending
  to a sorry business. Not that she believed for one moment that one son of
  hers had the blood of another on his soul. Still, Lady Stanmere sorely needed
  advice at this moment. She telegraphed for Martlett, only to be told that he
  had gone to Paris. Even Von Wrangel would have been something at this
  juncture.</p>

  <p>There was nobody but Mary, from whom the facts were carefully concealed,
  and Nurse Cecilia. The latter came down to the drawing-room with a copy of
  'The Standard' in her hand.</p>

  <p>"Have you read all this, my lady?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere had read every line of it in the Telegraph. She could not
  understand it at all. She was quite sure that Paul had nothing to do with the
  crime. One of those dreadful secret societies was at the bottom of it all.
  Cecilia listened with well disguised impatience.</p>

  <p>"It is no time to speculate," she said, her eyes gleaming. "I have tried
  to look at this matter as if I were one of the people&mdash;one of the jury.
  Mr. Paul stands in a terrible position. And everybody seems to have deserted
  him just at the moment when he needs friends. If you were to tell Miss
  Mary&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not for worlds," Lady Stanmere cried. "A shock at the present moment
  might be serious. And&mdash;and she is all that I have to care for now. I try
  to be calm and contained, Cecilia, but if you only knew. If I could tell what
  to do&mdash;if I could make some sacrifice!"</p>

  <p>The knitting fell from the trembling hands. Nurse Cecilia walked away to
  Mary's bedroom. She marvelled at the blindness that seemed to have fallen on
  everybody save Von Wrangel and herself. Mary was sitting by a table arranging
  flowers.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mary," she said carelessly, "are you quite sure you were correct as
  to what you said about seeing your father the other night? After a long
  period of blindness&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I was not blind, Cecilia," Mary smiled. "I saw my father distinctly.
  He looked better and nobler than he used to do, but I recognised him in that
  brief instant. And he was in trouble; it was easy to read that much from the
  expression of his face. I believe that he came here to have a few words with
  me in secret, only I was alarmed, and he ran away. There are reasons why he
  cannot come to Stanmere, as he has so often told me. But he was here that
  night."</p>

  <p>"Did you tell this to Herr Von Wrangel?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly I did. And he tested my sight to see if such a thing was
  possible. He proved to himself that it was. And then he said a curious thing.
  He asked me to postpone the operation for a day or two in the interests of
  one whom I loved. It sounded like more mystery, but I asked no questions. I
  consented. And now you know as much of the matter as I do."</p>

  <p>Cecilia knew a great deal more, but it was not her cue to say so. She
  stayed on chatting for a few minutes, but she had not the least idea what she
  was talking about. Here was a way out of the difficulty at last, a way,
  perhaps, attended by further scandal, but sufficient to clear Paul Spencer of
  the terrible charge hanging over him.</p>

  <p>But why had not Von Wrangel moved in the matter? He knew the facts of the
  case better than she did. And the little German doctor seemed to be as much
  indifferent to what was going on as did Mr. Martlett. A happy thought came to
  Cecilia.</p>

  <p>She would go up and see Martlett; she would follow him to Paris if
  necessary. Anything was better than the maddening inaction, to one of her
  quick temperament. She would get Mr. Martlett's address from the office and
  take the night boat to Calais.</p>

  <p>But there was no necessity to do that. As she reached Lincoln's Inn she
  saw Mr. Martlett going in the direction of his office, with his hands behind
  his back, and apparently in an unusually tranquil frame of mind. Cecilia
  grasped him by the arm vigorously.</p>

  <p>"Ah," he said, "Nurse Cecilia. You look disturbed. I am just back from
  Paris. What is wrong?"</p>

  <p>Cecilia proceeded to explain, breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Presently, presently," Martlett said. "Yes, I see the force of your
  discovery. Come back to me in an hour. I have a most pressing engagement at
  present, which is not entirely disconnected with the family you have such a
  high regard for. It is all coming right, my dear woman."</p>

  <p>Cecilia sat down in the Embankment gardens with a strange feeling of
  relief. Martlett was never a man who committed himself, and if he said that
  everything was coming right he spoke from accurate knowledge. Meanwhile,
  Martlett entered his office, where Paul Spencer was waiting for him. The
  lawyer shook hands with his client in the most matter-of-fact way.</p>

  <p>"So you seem to have been getting yourself into a fine mess," he said,
  "but there is one clear way out of it, and if you don't take it, I shall have
  to take it for you. I have been in Paris on your business. I have been
  hearing some wonderfully interesting details as to the private life of Mr.
  James Miller. You recollect James Miller?"</p>

  <p>A shade passed over the face of the listener.</p>

  <p>"I have cause to," he said. "It was the one act that has darkened my life.
  Why rake that old matter up now, Martlett?"</p>

  <p>"Because it is absolutely necessary to do so, my dear fellow. And who do
  you suppose supplied me with all the details of that picturesque scoundrel's
  career? Why one Maxwell&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Maxwell? You don't mean to say that he is in Europe?"</p>

  <p>"He was in Paris yesterday, and he is in London to-day. To go still
  further, he is very near; in fact, he is at the present moment sitting in the
  office of my clerk, and he is looking forward to the pleasure of an interview
  with you."</p>

  <p>Spencer rose from his seat and hurried to the door. He seemed to have
  forgotten himself for the moment, forgotten everything in the wild desire for
  flight. By main force Martlett dragged him back again into his seat.</p>

  <p>"You fool," he said contemptuously. "You have absolutely nothing to
  fear."</p>

  <p>"Nemesis," Gay cried. "Nemesis. It has come at last; it always was
  inevitable."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch54"
     name="ch54"></a>LIV. &mdash; CROSS PURPOSES.</h2>

  <p>Lady Stanmere waited with patient resignation to see what was going to
  happen next. Fortunately there were no callers to worry her with idle
  curiosity or well-meant sympathy. The chatelaine of Stanmere had been a
  recluse for many years, alone with her sorrows, and almost forgotten by the
  world. She had less need of the world than ever now.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, life seemed to move on there as smoothly as ever. It seemed
  impossible to connect that house with all its quiet beauty with a sensational
  tragedy. The sun beat down on the piled-up woods and the trim lawns, the deer
  dozed in the bracken, the rose garden was still in full fragrance. Goss had
  some questions to answer and some curiosity to satisfy in the way of
  reporters, whom he fenced off with his best episcopal manner.</p>

  <p>Still, Mr. Martlett kept away, and Von Wrangel seemed to avoid the place.
  It was the third day before the latter came at length. He was a little quiet
  and subdued, but not quite so quiet as Lady Stanmere, engaged on her
  everlasting knitting.</p>

  <p>"So you have found out that I am in trouble?" she said.</p>

  <p>She did not look up, her hands were working restlessly. Von Wrangel looked
  round the perfectly-appointed drawing-room. He could conceive nothing more
  placid and restful. It was the very place to get rid of nerves and brain
  worries of all kinds.</p>

  <p>"I have been doing all I can for you," Von Wrangel said. "My dear lady,
  you are very angry with me."</p>

  <p>"I have been better pleased with you, I confess," Lady Stanmere said,
  without looking up from her work. "I am in great trouble."</p>

  <p>"And I am sorry for you from the bottom of my heart."</p>

  <p>"I am in great trouble, and nobody came near me. Even Martlett seems to
  have vanished; and there are so many things to think of. My unhappy boy must
  be buried here. But I suppose nobody has thought of that."</p>

  <p>But Von Wrangel had thought of everything. He had taken the liberty of
  making all the necessary arrangements, or he would have been at Stanmere
  before. He was deeply sorry for the unhappy grey lady, who was the mother of
  so many sorrows. Much grief had bowed her down, but she had reached the limit
  of resignation now, and only waited for the end.</p>

  <p>"It is a dreadful thing," she went on. "Of course, I had expected
  something like this. My unhappy boy was predestined for a violent death."</p>

  <p>"For which you hold me more or less responsible?"</p>

  <p>"No; you were merely an instrument. I have lived in daily expectation of
  something of this kind; I felt that fate had the blow in store for me. But I
  never dreamt that fate would give the blow such a cruel twist as this. Not
  that Paul is guilty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Paul is absolutely innocent," Von Wrangel exclaimed. "To-morrow the
  inquest will be finished, and I shall give my evidence. I shall be in a
  position to tell the police a thing or two. Those shadows have been dogging
  Stephen for years. The result was inevitable. The assassin managed to get
  into the room in Paul's absence, and the rest you can imagine. But I have a
  witness who will settle the matter for all time."</p>

  <p>"And who may that be," Lady Stanmere asked. "Oh, I am interested. After
  all, Paul is my own flesh and blood. They tell me he has lived a good life
  for years, and that he is rich and respected. In that case, why did he not
  come down here? Why did he not come and see his mother, who would have
  welcomed him with open arms? Here is a beautiful property, one of the best
  and richest in the country. And Paul is Lord Stanmere, though he calls
  himself Paul Spencer. Can you account for all this unnecessary mystery?"</p>

  <p>It was by no means an unnecessary mystery, as Von Wrangel might have
  explained. But he had done too much by his tongue already, and besides the
  secret was not to be told. He shifted his ground a little.</p>

  <p>"It is all going to be cleared up in a few days," he said. "And then I
  think you will recognise the fact that the succession to Stanmere is in good
  hands."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel went away, leaving Lady Stanmere with a vague sense of
  comfort. At any rate, it was good to know that her surviving son's good name
  was cleared, and that the time was coming when he could step into his
  property without any stain upon his honour. But why had he not come down
  before, why had he kept out of the way all these years? True, Stephen had
  been the eldest son, so that Paul had till recently nothing to expect from
  Stanmere, and was of comparatively small importance. But then he seemed to
  have atoned for his early wildness years ago, he had grown rich and
  respectable and prosperous, and with all his faults he had always professed
  to be fond of his mother.</p>

  <p>And yet since she had first heard of his return from America, five years
  ago, she had not had one line from him. Her heart stirred within her as she
  thought of it all. She had Mary, to whom she had given all her affection, but
  it would be good to walk up the aisle of Stanmere Church on the arm of a son
  who could look the whole world in the face.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was coming. And Von Wrangel had said nothing as to the
  completion of his operation on Mary's eyes. He had put it off more or less
  unexpectedly a day or two before, and had hurried to London.</p>

  <p>But the thing was uppermost in Von Wrangel's mind as he went through the
  house looking for Nurse Cecilia. Mary was out somewhere with Molly
  Stephenson, who openly bewailed the strange defection of her lover. Dick was
  in town, where he expected to remain for the moment. Nurse Cecilia was in the
  garden reading a letter when Von Wrangel found her.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with you?" he asked in his quick way. "Are you glad or
  sorry? Your face says glad, and your eyes say sorry. What is it?"</p>

  <p>Cecilia turned to the speaker with an unsteady smile on her lips.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she said. "Many clever men say they do not understand
  women. That is not so very wonderful when women can't understand themselves.
  I am an enigma to myself, for instance. I was trying to solve the riddle when
  you came up."</p>

  <p>"Through the medium of that letter, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely. It is fresh from my husband. Now you and I know the secret of
  the mystery that has so long surrounded Stanmere. There is no occasion for
  mystery any longer, since Mr. Stephen is dead."</p>

  <p>"Don't forget that your husband still remains."</p>

  <p>"I am coming to that," Cecilia said. "To hoodwink my husband all this
  elaborate plot has been necessary. It was quite justified, because it
  succeeded admirably. But Horace Venner found it out at last, and he was going
  to make himself rich over it. I was glad that he made his discovery too late.
  His claws have been clipped; his guilty knowledge was a lie. He is utterly
  beaten, and he has given up the game in despair and is going abroad. And he
  wants me to join him."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel nodded. He knew a great deal more of the business than Cecilia
  imagined.</p>

  <p>"And being a woman, you are hesitating?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes. You see I loved that man at one time. I knew he was not good,
  but I hoped to reform him. And I have not forgotten that time."</p>

  <p>"Then forget it at once," Von Wrangel said, vehemently. "I don't want to
  give you pain, but Venner is a scoundrel in grain. He could not help it. I
  know the history of that man's life. It is bad from start to finish. He would
  never keep to the straight path. If you go with him you march hand in hand
  with misery to the grave. You are embarked on a noble career where you are
  doing good. Why abandon it? and if your husband is sincere let him show it.
  Let him come to you in two years' time and prove the value of his words."</p>

  <p>Cecilia removed the traces of tears from her dark eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are right," she said. "I had not thought of that. I will write to
  Horace. And in the meantime I have others to think of."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel nodded significantly. He was eager enough now.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mary," he said, "you must go and find her. Whether Lady Stanmere
  likes it or not, she must come to London with me this evening."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is impossible to keep her out of it?" Cecilia asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course it is. The man whom we will call Paul Spencer for the nonce is
  exceedingly obstinate. He will not say where he was on the night of the
  murder. He was down here, of course. We know that he came; Miss Mary saw him.
  But he does not know as yet that she really saw him, hence he deems it quite
  useless to mention the circumstance. Miss Mary will go into the witness-box,
  and after hearing what I have to say, there will be no further question as to
  Paul's innocence."</p>

  <p>Cecilia was turning the thing thoughtfully over in her mind.</p>

  <p>"I dare say," she said. "But why didn't you complete the operation and
  make the thing assured?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, you do not appreciate the subtleties of the legal mind. I should be
  very severely cross-examined as to whether the poor girl could see or not.
  Then I should have to admit that I left my operation unfinished at a point
  where it was dubious to say how successful I should be. There is no doubt in
  my mind, but then it is possible that I might have failed. If I HAD failed,
  then Miss Mary's evidence would have been absolutely useless. If she had gone
  into the witness box BLIND, her evidence would have been worthless. No jury
  would have believed that she SAW, just for the correct psychological moment.
  But by leaving her as she is, we can prove that she can see, and that there
  has been no tampering with her sight. Do you understand what I mean?"</p>

  <p>Cecilia understood quite clearly. She appreciated the thoughtful way in
  which Von Wrangel worked the matter out. At first she had regarded the whole
  thing as one of his wild vagaries. On other people's business the man was
  superb. It was only when he came to manage his own that he usually made so
  dismal a failure of it.</p>

  <p>"You are wonderful," Cecilia cried. "I should never have thought of
  that."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not. Anyway, Miss Mary can see enough for our purpose. And
  directly she has given her evidence we will finish the operation. Only a day
  or two longer and everything will be made clear. I am under a heavy debt to
  the house, and I am trying to repay it. If I had never come here at all how
  different things might have been!"</p>

  <p>It was nearly tea-time before Mary came in, her hands full of wild
  flowers. She seemed to be happy and gay enough. She was glad to see Von
  Wrangel again. He lifted the bandage from her eyes and held a small object up
  before them.</p>

  <p>"Can you see this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Pretty plainly," Mary cried. "It is a small pearl handled pocketknife
  with a silver name-plate on it. Herr Baron, when are you going to give me my
  sight back again?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be glad to hear that also," Lady Stanmere said, quietly.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," Von Wrangel explained; "some time to-morrow. It will take
  place in London, where I have borrowed the operating-room of a famous surgeon
  friend of mine. Lady Stanmere must spare you for a few hours. You are going
  back to London with me this evening."</p>

  <p>"More mystery?" Mary cried. "Is there never to be an end of it?"</p>

  <p>"Mary is not going to London," Lady Stanmere said. "I have quite decided
  upon that."</p>

  <p>"The operation takes place in London to-morrow, and the mystery ends at
  the same time," Von Wrangel said, with a flash of his eyes. "Once for all,
  and the last time, I am going to assert myself. Miss Mary goes to London with
  me. Within four-and-twenty hours more those eyes will be clear to read this
  mystery, which shall be made plain to ordinary intelligence."</p>

  <p>"But surely," Lady Stanmere expostulated, "Mary has no need&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Miss Mary has every need. No, I cannot explain. You must be content to
  take my word for it. Let Nurse Cecilia make all arrangements."</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere resisted no longer. She had no power to fight against Von
  Wrangel.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said, helplessly. "But you must bring her back again. Von
  Wrangel, you will give me your word of honor to bring her back again?"</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel bent over the still grey figure and whispered in her ear.</p>

  <p>"I will give you my word as to that," he murmured. "I will bring Mary back
  to-morrow night; aye, and I will bring back Paul, Lord Stanmere, as
  well."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch55"
     name="ch55"></a>LV. &mdash; FREE!</h2>

  <p>Paul Spencer, Lord Stanmere, stood facing Martlett like a man in a dream.
  It seemed to him that the clouds had gathered from all sides to overwhelm
  him. So this man had been hunting him, too, and had at length found him. He
  could fight no longer.</p>

  <p>"If I must, I must," he said. "I knew Maxwell years ago. His mother lived
  near Stanmere. We were great friends at one time. We exchanged photographs. I
  have them at home now. And he used to come to England occasionally to see
  that eccentric old mother of his and bring me news of Stanmere. But I killed
  a man who was his partner, you see."</p>

  <p>"By your own showing Jim Miller was a scoundrel," Martlett observed.</p>

  <p>"That made no difference. Maxwell was on the vigilance committee. I shot
  Miller in what was little less than a vulgar brawl, and I had to fly. As San
  Francisco was at that moment, my life would have paid the penalty had I
  stayed. Even now I am liable to be extradited and hanged. From that day to
  this I have seen nothing of Maxwell."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, he has been looking for you everywhere," Martlett put
  in.</p>

  <p>"I do not doubt it for a moment. Well, he has been successful at last. I
  will hide no longer. Call Maxwell in and get the painful ordeal over."</p>

  <p>"I did not gather that it was going to be painful," Martlett said, dryly.
  "On the contrary, I gleaned quite a contrary opinion. I have a pleasant
  surprise for you."</p>

  <p>"Impossible. I killed that man and Venner knows it. Maxwell might forgive
  me, but Venner will always use his knowledge. But for Venner&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But for Venner there would have been no trouble or complication at all. I
  know that quite as well as you do. But we are going to scotch that snake
  permanently. He will be here very soon, and you shall have the pleasure of
  kicking him out of the office yourself, with the pleasing knowledge that he
  is quite powerless for the future."</p>

  <p>But Spencer was hardly listening. His mind had gone back into the past.
  Martlett was not a man who promised vain things as a rule, but he was
  entirely over-sanguine now. And the dull office with its dust and gloom and
  musty paper was hardly the environment of a miracle. Martlett rang the bell
  and the door opened; a big man in a rough shooting suit walked in.</p>

  <p>His round face was beaming with good humor, his eyes were full of
  pleasure. He strode up to the dazed Spencer and gripped him with a force that
  was real enough.</p>

  <p>"So you have been frightening yourself with ghosts all these years," he
  said. "Running away from me and the ghost of my queer partner, Jim Miller! If
  I had known what a thorough-paced ruffian Miller was I should never have
  chummed in with him. But I didn't know until it was too late, and then I
  tried to get rid of him, and he knew it. I don't like failing."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I succeed where you failed," Spencer said, bitterly.</p>

  <p>"And you have been haunted by that rascal's ghost ever since, eh?"</p>

  <p>"By that and by a nemesis in the form of my old servant Horace Venner. You
  remember the fellow that I had to get rid of out yonder. He came back upon me
  at a time when fortune was smiling her sweetest. And there was no way of
  getting rid of him."</p>

  <p>Maxwell laughed and smote the speaker on the back heartily.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he said. "If you had only stayed a day or two longer, if you
  had only faced the music. Do you suppose we should have let you hang?"</p>

  <p>"There was Denman, for instance. A good citizen who defended his
  life&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That was a mistake. You see we hadn't got matters quite in hand then. But
  you might have stayed a bit longer&mdash;long enough to find out."</p>

  <p>"But I came back with my daughter," Spencer cried, eagerly. "I wanted to
  see you and explain. But Venner turned up there, of all places in the world,
  and I had to fly."</p>

  <p>"It was unfortunate I did not see you," Maxwell replied. "If I had done
  so, my dear Paul, I should have hanged your nemesis for you. So he turned up
  at 'Frisco? Really, the audacity of the fellow is amazing. But my young
  friend Seymour has cut him close now."</p>

  <p>"You mean that there is some charge hanging over his head?"</p>

  <p>Maxwell laughed, and Martlett permitted himself to relax into a smile.
  Maxwell was smoking a cigar in the precincts of the office, a flagrant
  disregard of precedent and proprieties. But it was to be a red-letter day in
  the annals of the old family solicitor.</p>

  <p>"I do," he said. "The evidence is very clear. When Venner comes down here
  I am going to charge him with the wilful murder of one Jim Miller in San
  Francisco on Saturday, August the fifteenth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I killed him myself," Spencer cried. "I shot him down. I saw him
  fall."</p>

  <p>"All the same, you didn't kill him," Maxwell said, coolly. "Here is the
  man who did. Come, you rascal, tell us how you murdered James Miller?"</p>

  <p>Venner had been pushed by somebody into the room. He advanced with the
  carneying smile and the servile tread of the well-trained servant who has
  been caught in some flagrant dishonesty, and who hopes to work upon the good
  nature of his employer. He paused with a gasping cry, and would have turned
  and fled had not Seymour stood by, big and strong, in the doorway.</p>

  <p>Venner dropped into a chair and wiped his wet face. He ground the palms of
  his hands together and feebly suggested that his heart was weak. The shock
  had turned him sick and dizzy. The big form of Maxwell floated in a mist
  before his eyes.</p>

  <p>"This is a surprise," he gasped; "really a great surprise."</p>

  <p>"I thought it would be," Seymour said, grimly. "I worked hard to make it
  so. I am extremely glad to find that you are not disappointed."</p>

  <p>"A great surprise," Venner groaned feebly. "Mr. Maxwell, sir, I hope you
  are well; I hope&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You don't hope anything of the kind," Maxwell said. "If you could see the
  whole of us dead at your feet you would be glad. Get up off that chair; how
  dare you sit down in the presence of your betters! Get up at once and tell us
  your story."</p>

  <p>Venner staggered to his feet. He passed his tongue over his dry lips.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," he whined. "May I ask for a little patience for an
  unfortunate valet who is not the man he was? As I was saying,
  gentlemen&mdash;But, really, I feel so queer that&mdash;I'm better now. Just
  as well for me to make a clean breast of it; I did kill Jim Miller."</p>

  <p>He paused as if to give effect to his words.</p>

  <p>"My master, Mr. Paul, had discharged me. I don't say I didn't deserve it;
  but the fact remains. A good deal of the early troubles would never have been
  if Mr. Paul had not seen me at all. I was a bad lot, gentlemen, as a boy, and
  I shall never be anything better."</p>

  <p>A murmur of approval followed from the interested listeners.</p>

  <p>"But, we need not go into that. I am making the confession because if I
  don't do so I shall have to stand my trial. To go back again. Usually I
  flatter myself that I tell really a good story, but I have had a great shock
  to-day. Where am I? Oh, at the beginning. Well, I was quite discredited and
  without money. I hung about Mr. Paul, and I watched him carefully. Then I
  discovered that there had been a quarrel between you two gentlemen and Jim
  Miller, and it seemed to me that I might be able to make something out of it,
  especially as Miller was going to get you both out of the way.</p>

  <p>"He meant to force a fight on you, and he chose Mr. Paul first. Mr. Paul,
  sir, when you entered that hut you were a doomed man. It was fortunate for
  you that you were warned by a sudden blow, and that you got your gun out
  first. Then you fired; I watched you from behind the door. You imagined that
  you killed your man, as he fell like a stone covered in blood, but you did
  nothing of the kind. You bolted off without looking once behind you, and then
  you gave yourself into my power.</p>

  <p>"Miller was not dead at all. He was stunned by a bullet that grazed his
  temple. I thought he was dead, and here my chance came in. There was money in
  that hut hidden under a floor board. I went to get it. As I was getting it
  Miller sat up and looked at me in a dazed kind of way. There was only one
  thing for it. I shot him through the head, and left with more money than ever
  I had in my pocket before, and that is saying a good deal. I was fairly
  comfortable in my mind, because the crime would be put on you."</p>

  <p>"But only for a time," said Maxwell. "The bullets didn't tally, so that
  gave us a clue. A coolie gave us another, and by the time my friend Paul had
  fled for his life, we were hot upon the track of our interesting
  autobiographical visitor here. We had enough evidence to hang him ten times
  over. But he got away, as these fellows always do, and that's about the end
  of the story."</p>

  <p>It all seemed so simple now that it was told, but at the same time
  something in the shape of a modern miracle had happened. Paul Spencer Gay,
  Lord Stanmere, had never killed Miller at all; he had been free to hold up
  his head amongst men all these years, and yet he had walked in the sackcloth
  and ashes of repentance. His lingers itched to be at the sanguine throat of
  Horace Venner.</p>

  <p>"Go on, you scoundrel," he said. "You have a little more to tell."</p>

  <p>"Not much, sir," Venner said, meekly. "You had got away and I had got
  away. I found that you were in London in a prosperous condition. There was
  another little chance for me. With my luck you were still firmly of the
  opinion that you had killed Miller. If I could only find you, what a good
  time I might have. And I did find you, only you eluded me and got away. And
  then you put up a deception that led me from the track altogether. I fancy
  that my wife knew when I came back to her, but she said nothing, and till I
  happened to see you and Mr. Spencer together that night at Stanmere I had not
  the slightest idea of the way in which the feather had been drawn over my
  eyes. Mr. Martlett&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Has nothing whatever to do with it," the lawyer said shortly. "Go
  on."</p>

  <p>But there was no more to say. The whole thing had been exposed, the bubble
  pricked, the scoundrel wrecked. He hung about in his servile way as if
  waiting for something.</p>

  <p>"Send him to Australia," Spencer said; "pay his passage and give him one
  hundred pounds to start with. The scoundrel doesn't deserve it, but for the
  sake of the wife&mdash;and if you ever come back again I shall set the police
  on your track as sure as you are alive. Go out."</p>

  <p>Venner crept away with the carneying smile on his face. There was silence
  for a little while after he had gone.</p>

  <p>"Now what is the next thing?" Spencer asked.</p>

  <p>"After to-morrow," Martlett said, thoughtfully, "the next thing is to put
  the cover on the whole business and go down with me to Stanmere."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch56"
     name="ch56"></a>LVI. &mdash; CLEARED.</h2>

  <p>So there had been nothing to fear all those long years. Paul Spencer, Lord
  Stanmere, felt like a man who has found the surface after a long and
  hazardous dive. He was absolutely free to go where he liked without fear of
  that shadow before his eyes. He went off to his own house as soon as he had
  finished with Martlett. His present wish was to be alone.</p>

  <p>He was alone now, even the faithful Kant was nowhere to be seen. He sat in
  the window of the morning-room smoking a cigar, a most unusual thing for him
  to do at this time of the day. But he wanted to enjoy the luxury of feeling
  like other men. He watched the people coming and going with a glad feeling of
  satisfaction that he was like them, comfortable and commonplace, and free to
  do as he pleased. He was sitting there when Kant came in.</p>

  <p>The faithful servant glanced at him uneasily. All this was so contrary to
  the morbid prudence of the last few years. There was an air about the master
  of the house that Kant had not seen for many a day. He advanced to draw down
  the blind.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," he said, "you don't seem to be aware that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am not aware of anything beyond the fact that I am free," Spencer
  replied. "My good Kant, the miracle has happened. I am absolutely free."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say that Venner is dead, sir?" Kant asked.</p>

  <p>"To me, yes; to the world, unfortunately no. I have been flying from
  shadows, Kant. There is no blood on my soul. It was all a strange mistake.
  Perhaps I had better explain."</p>

  <p>He proceeded to do so. Kant's inscrutable features gradually relaxed into
  a smile. After a time he became his grave self again.</p>

  <p>"But what about the other little matter, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Spencer came down from the clouds. In the joy of his new-found freedom he
  had forgotten all about that. He still stood in a position of some peril.</p>

  <p>"I shall be able to prove an alibi now," he said, thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Because there is no reason why you should not explain your visit to
  Stanmere, sir. That is all very well in its way, sir, but it only makes more
  scandal. There is no need for the world to know anything about Miss Mary.
  Keep her out of it if you can, for you owe her a great deal. She must know,
  and Lady Stanmere must know, but a curious public need not. I am afraid that
  I am taking a great liberty, sir."</p>

  <p>"You are not doing anything of the kind," Spencer replied. "You have been
  a wonderfully good and faithful servant to me, and I am not likely to forget
  it. I had better consult Mr. Martlett. In this matter I shall be guided by
  his opinion."</p>

  <p>It was later in the afternoon when Spencer walked to Lincoln's Inn. It had
  been years since he leisurely strolled through London in broad day-light. The
  whole thing was a luxury that he enjoyed beyond measure. There were no
  lurking shadows now. Here was the place where Stephen had come out and
  attacked him; there was the spot where he had almost walked into Venner's
  arms one November evening. But all these terrors had gone.</p>

  <p>He walked into Martlett's office, tall, expanding, commanding of presence.
  Martlett smiled behind his hand as he noticed the change.</p>

  <p>"It is a fine afternoon, my lord," he said, drily.</p>

  <p>Spencer colored slightly. He perfectly understood Martlett's meaning.</p>

  <p>"Don't call me that yet," he said, "and my poor brother only buried this
  morning, Martlett. I have been indulging in the luxury of my freedom. Kant
  reminds me that I am not yet out of the wood. At the inquest to-morrow I
  should like to make my position perfectly clear. I can say now where I was at
  the time of the murder."</p>

  <p>"Which was at Stanmere, I presume?"</p>

  <p>"Quite so. I went down there to see Mary, or, rather, on the off-chance of
  seeing her. To be perfectly candid, I wanted to persuade her to postpone that
  operation."</p>

  <p>Martlett scraped his dry chin thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I quite understand," he said. "You seem to have raised a certain amount
  of prejudice over this matter. Our young friend, Dick Stevenson, for
  instance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Regards me as an unfeeling monster. It is not often that anyone has
  spoken to me as he did. But a day or two ago the thing seemed absolutely
  necessary."</p>

  <p>"Well, get on. It is not necessary any longer. Miss Mary must at
  once&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course, of course. I desire nothing better than a speedy chance of
  putting myself right in everybody's eyes. And I am longing for a good time at
  Stanmere."</p>

  <p>"Also you want to get the thing settled without any suggestion of scandal.
  Now tell me exactly what happened at Stanmere when you were there the other
  night."</p>

  <p>Spencer proceeded to explain. Martlett smiled with the air of a man who
  sees his way.</p>

  <p>"You saw Miss Mary!" he said. "She cried out and you had to vanish. There
  is no need to go into all this before the coroner. You saw the child and she
  saw you."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Martlett, consider that it was impossible&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I say she saw you,'" Martlett went on, doggedly. "There was a bandage
  over her eyes; I suppose you imagined that was a kind of preliminary
  operation performed by Von Wrangel. The bandage slipped off her eyes and she
  saw you as plainly as I see you now."</p>

  <p>"Then the operation has been performed?"</p>

  <p>"Partly! In a measure it was your bete noir, Venner, who prevented the
  success of the affair. I have all the facts from Von Wrangel. Perhaps I had
  better explain."</p>

  <p>Spencer listened with the deepest interest. He was not astonished, for so
  many things had happened lately that he was past extremes in emotion.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mary could identify you across a room," Martlett went on. "She shall
  come up and do so at the inquest. All she has to do is to say that she saw
  you in the corridor about the time of the murder, and there will be an end of
  the matter. Wear the same clothes and tie to-morrow that you wore that night.
  After what Miss Mary and Von Wrangel have to say there will be no question as
  to your&mdash;er&mdash;innocence. Now you had better come with me and settle
  the question of the last mortgage."</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel stood giving his evidence quietly and coolly, knocking the
  last leaves of sensational romance out of what the papers called the Cambria
  Square mystery. There had been no blood feud between the two brothers beyond
  a quarrel which was entirely outside the premises of the court. Stephen Gay
  was a passionate man, and like most passionate men, was given to say a great
  deal more than he intended. He had assaulted his brother, it was true; but
  then every man who commits bodily violence is not necessarily a murderer at
  heart. Stephen Gay had been the victim of a political society.</p>

  <p>"That is your opinion?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"It is my knowledge," Von Wrangel said, calmly. "I once belonged to the
  same society myself, but I am Baron Von Wrangel, once known as an eye
  specialist. Two nights before the murder the man who had a hand in the crime
  actually told me where I should find the dead man, and what was going to
  happen him."</p>

  <p>A murmur of astonishment ran round the room. There was a sensation of
  quite another kind.</p>

  <p>"And you gave no notice to the police?" the coroner asked, sternly.</p>

  <p>"It was useless," Von Wrangel replied. "I was doing my best to get the
  dead man away. If I had told the police and the gang had been arrested,
  others would have sprung up immediately to take their place; I should not
  have known them, and consequently would have been placed at a great
  disadvantage in my endeavors to battle them. The police would have been
  powerless."</p>

  <p>The coroner shook his head gravely. All this was quite contrary to
  constitutional practices. The police should have been informed without
  delay.</p>

  <p>"I was of more use than all the police in in Europe," Von Wrangel went on.
  "I should have baffled these men if the deceased had followed my advice. He
  had betrayed his cause and his life was forfeit. My own life was forfeit at
  one time, though I lost everything for the cause&mdash;hence my assumed name
  and the humble nature of my lodging."</p>

  <p>"Do I understand that you advocate this kind of violence?" the coroner
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Quite the contrary," Von Wrangel said, coolly. "It cost me all I had to
  prevent it. I would have done much to save the life of Stephen Gay, but it
  was impossible. He was a marked man by half the secret societies of Europe.
  See how cleverly they managed it. They got into the house in Cambria Square,
  then committed that crime without leaving a trace behind. They will never be
  caught. I am willing to give the police the names and description of two of
  the gang, and I am ready to stake my reputation that the police will never
  arrest them. The authorities in Berlin knew all about Stephen Gay and the way
  that he betrayed the trust placed in him; they will tell you exactly what I
  am telling you now, and they will not hesitate to confirm my opinion. If I
  stay here all night I can say no more."</p>

  <p>For a long time Von Wrangel stood there undergoing a shower of questions.
  But his calm assurance and firm conviction remained entirely unshaken. All
  the romance was going out of the case, it was only one of those vulgar
  political murders after all. When Von Wrangel stood down at length there was
  hardly a person in the room who would have held Paul Spencer responsible for
  the mystery now.</p>

  <p>The latter stood up calm and resolute, and demanded to give evidence. He
  could tell the court now what he was for private reasons unable to tell them
  before. On the night of the murder he had gone down to Stanmere to see his
  daughter. Unfortunately he had not been able to have the interview that he
  desired, because his daughter had been partly under an operation for her
  eyes, but she had seen him in the corridor at the time mentioned and would
  testify to the fact.</p>

  <p>"But is not your daughter blind?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"She was," Spencer replied. "But she has the sight of one eye. The
  operation was interrupted, but she can see for all practical purposes."</p>

  <p>The coroner, as a matter of form, would like Miss Spencer to be called.
  Not that there was much doubt as to the case after the evidence of Baron Von
  Wrangel. Miss Spencer was outside the court with friends and was available at
  any moment, Martlett intimated.</p>

  <p>Here was just an element of romance in the case after all. There was
  something pathetic in the partially blind girl coming forward to clear her
  own father. With a bandage over her eyes Mary was led forward. The sweet,
  patient face and the clear voice made a deep impression.</p>

  <p>"I did not expect my father," Mary said. "I understood that he had not
  been told of the operation; at any rate, I hoped it would be a pleasant
  surprise for him. I was in bed the night my father came. I fancied that I
  heard him call to me and I went into the corridor. The bandage slipped from
  my eyes and I called out, suddenly. A moment later and my father was
  gone."</p>

  <p>"Why should he have gone so hurriedly?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"That I cannot tell you," Mary said, quietly. "I believe there are reasons
  why my father does not care to be seen at Stanmere. But he was there at the
  time I speak of."</p>

  <p>The coroner pressed the question. It was impossible to deny the
  credibility of the witness.</p>

  <p>"How was your father dressed?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He had a grey frock suit and a red tie," Mary said. "If I may remove this
  bandage for a moment&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel jumped up and performed the necessary office. In a misty kind
  of way Mary looked round the room and smiled finally at Spencer, whose face
  flushed uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Just the same as he is dressed now," Mary cried, "only there was no pin
  in his scarf. It was a little past the hour when I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But there was no need to say any more. Almost as soon as the bandage was
  removed Von Wrangel had it back again. There were no more witnesses to call,
  and the coroner proceeded to put the case to the jury. He was a little hard
  upon Von Wrangel, but the German listened calmly enough to that and the
  verdict of wilful murder against some persons or person unknown.</p>

  <p>Outside the court Mary found herself leaning on her father's arm.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going now?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You are going back to Stanmere to-night," Spencer said. "Von Wrangel is
  anxious to finish his work. And I hope to join you to-morrow. The shadows are
  all falling away now, Mary."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch57"
     name="ch57"></a>LVII. &mdash; MARY SEES AT LAST.</h2>

  <p>Dick and Molly were having a bad time of it at the hands of Von Wrangel.
  The little German was all impatience to finish the work that he had already
  begun; he was cross and snappish in the cab which conveyed the party to the
  operating-room which had been loaned for the occasion. Nurse Cecilia was
  waiting there, but there would be no need for her services.</p>

  <p>"And why you two people came along, goodness knows," Von Wrangel said,
  testily. "Go away and look at the shops. Go and find my friend Tom Seymour.
  Scold him him for neglecting you all this time, Miss Molly. Then come back in
  an hour's time and we will go back to Stanmere together. At present I am not
  what you call in the most seraphic mood."</p>

  <p>"You are absolutely intolerable," Molly laughed, "and Mary has my deepest
  sympathy."</p>

  <p>Mary smiled sweetly. She was the only one of the party who seemed
  absolutely at her ease. Cecilia stood by, quietly looking out of her pale
  face with dark mournful eyes. Von Wrangel hustled them up the steps without
  ceremony and closed the door behind them. Once he was in the operating room
  his manner changed entirely. He was the cool resolute doctor once more.</p>

  <p>"Now then," he said, "it is only a matter of a few minutes. But I don't
  want those young people about me for a while. Nurse, will you hand me those
  cases?"</p>

  <p>It was all over almost before Mary was aware that her eyes had been
  touched. There was just a prick or two, a cold lotion on her face, and she
  was looking up at Von Wrangel, who stood there with a quiet smile of triumph
  and power on his face.</p>

  <p>The blinds were all drawn, but it was quite possible to see there. Mary
  noted the pictures on the walls and a bunch of late primroses by her side.
  She could see the wrinkled green foliage and the yellow sheen on the
  blossoms.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is wonderful," she cried. "Wonderful. And it is going to last.
  Doctor, doctor, I am very much afraid that I am going to have a good
  cry."</p>

  <p>"The best prescription for you in the world," Von Wrangel said,
  cheerfully. "Have a nice long, comfortable cry with Nurse Cecilia to help you
  whilst I go and smoke a cigarette. And, between ourselves, I feel that I have
  earned it. Afterwards you are to put on those smoked glasses. They are pretty
  hideous, but it will be only for a day or two."</p>

  <p>Mary lay back for a long time crying quietly, with Cecilia stroking her
  hair and whispering soothing words in her ears. But these tears were tears of
  pure delight, and seemed to carry off what might have been a dangerous
  hysterical outburst. When the eyes had regained their tranquility again,
  Cecilia fitted on the smoked glasses and bade Mary look at herself.</p>

  <p>"You must get used to your beauty yourself," she laughed. "What do you
  think of that?"</p>

  <p>Mary declared it was the pleasantest sight she had ever seen in her life.
  Outside people were passing; there were horses and carriages and dogs that
  Mary regarded with a childish delight.</p>

  <p>"And there is Molly," she cried. "I am sure it must be Molly. Yes, there
  is Von Wrangel talking to them&mdash;I am sure it is Von Wrangel. And one of
  those young men must be my dear Dick. Cecilia, is Dick the one with the fair
  moustache?"</p>

  <p>"You have guessed it exactly, Miss Mary," Cecilia said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am so glad. And he is quite as handsome as Molly said he was. Let
  us go out and meet them and get back to dear old Stanmere as soon as
  possible. We must walk to Victoria. I could not think of riding on such a day
  as this."</p>

  <p>They were all on the doorstep talking together. Dick had got hold of Mary
  and was looking down into her eyes. Von Wrangel was being vigorously thumped
  on the back by Seymour. The little doctor was a wild schoolboy once more. It
  seemed impossible to associate him with anything serious. It was a long time
  before Dick spoke.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear," he said. "To think of it. My dear Mary!"</p>

  <p>She returned the pressure of his hand. Then she laid her hand on his arm
  and together they turned along the street in that glorified walk.</p>

  <p>"You talk and I will listen, Dick," Mary said. "If I say much I shall
  begin to cry again. No, I am not going to have a cab. I would not miss this
  walk for worlds. To see everything, to be like other people, to be able to
  look into your face!"</p>

  <p>She paused and swallowed down the lump that would come in her throat. Von
  Wrangel was laughing and chatting behind in his most inconsequent manner. It
  was like a fairy journey, the crowds, the bustling station, and then the
  green fields, the smiling landscape and the blue hills beyond. Mary sat
  drinking in its beauty with her hand closed in Dick's.</p>

  <p>"How familiar it all seems," she said. "There is the lodge and old Betty
  standing in the gateway ready for a chat with anybody who comes along. Let us
  go in by the side gate, for I could not stand Betty just for the present. And
  there is my dear grandmother in the rose garden. Dick, let us go up to her
  and take her quite by surprise."</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere's surprise and joy were both complete. Mary could see her as
  well as she could see Mary. And so it was to continue now for all time.</p>

  <p>"I shall see the light in those blue eyes of yours soon," Lady Stanmere
  said. "For the present I have only the joy of the recovery to think of. Von
  Wrangel, you have repaid everything, Mary's father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not a word," Von Wrangel whispered. "Say nothing about it, it is all
  coming right presently. Go into the arbour by the lake, gracious lady, and I
  will come to you presently. You have had one pleasant surprise to-day, and I
  hope you are strong enough to bear another."</p>

  <p>"I have not had so many that they pall upon me," Lady Stanmere said,
  quietly. "Well, I shall be glad for a few minutes' peace and quietness. If
  you only knew how miserably anxious I have been. Von Wrangel, I have greatly
  misjudged you."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind," Von Wrangel protested. "I am not worthy of your
  kind consideration. I am going to keep those young people from you till
  dinner time. It seems unkind, perhaps, but you are going to be glad
  presently. Now, do go as far as the arbour."</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere walked along with joy in her heart and a sense of
  unsteadiness in her limbs. She would be glad to sit down for a little
  time.</p>

  <p>But not alone, as she had expected. As she entered the arbour a tall
  figure in a grey suit arose and looked at her with wistful eyes. Lady
  Stanmere returned the glance with a drowsy kind of feeling upon her.
  Something that she had long lost had come back to her life again.</p>

  <p>"Paul," she said unsteadily; "Stanmere, is it really you?"</p>

  <p>She looked into the broad, open face again and could see no shadow of
  violence and passion there. She had pictured her lost boy to herself many
  times, but she had not hoped for this. For this man would have passed for
  something fine and wholesome and splendid everywhere. A true Gay, like his
  father; but with a grander air. Lady Stanmere held out her hands.</p>

  <p>"You have come to stay, I hope?" she said, in trembling tones. "Paul,
  Paul!"</p>

  <p>He stooped and kissed her reverently. There were tears in the eyes of both
  of them. Stanmere led his mother to a seat and sat beside her with her hand
  in his.</p>

  <p>"I shall realise it all presently," Lady Stanmere said. "But why have you
  been away so long? Why did you go at all, Paul?"</p>

  <p>"I went because I quarrelled with my father. I am afraid that my father
  never understood either of us. He spoils us one day, and we are sternly
  punished for such faults the next. And both Stephen and myself were always
  passionate and headstrong."</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere sighed; she had reason to remember that.</p>

  <p>"I declared that I would go and make my fortune," Stanmere went on. "I was
  not coming home until I could retrieve the family fortunes. After a time my
  dream looked like being realised, when a great misfortune happened to me.
  Presently I will tell you what that misfortune meant, and how it looked like
  preventing my accomplishing the task that I had cut out for myself. I had to
  stoop to deceit, and that deceit closed the doors of Stanmere to me."</p>

  <p>"But I should always have been glad to see you, my boy."</p>

  <p>"I know, I know. And I have often been nearer to you than you imagine. But
  we shall come to that presently. I dare not come here so long as I was
  practising that deceit. And thereby I did a cruel thing to you, for which I
  shall ask your forgiveness presently. It was a case where it seemed to me
  that the end justified the means. And all the time my project prospered. When
  my father died Stanmere was nearly out of my grasp. To-day it is perfectly
  cleared and a fine property."</p>

  <p>"And you have done all this, Paul? You are the means of saving the dear
  old home."</p>

  <p>"Yes; that much I can take credit for. I arranged it through Martlett.
  What means I had to take to do it, I shall explain later on. I hope to be
  forgiven, for I have done no real harm. My dear mother, will you be so good
  as to fetch Mary to me? I see her yonder with Von Wrangel. Bring her here,
  and let us not have anybody else for a few minutes."</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere came back with Mary presently. She could see Stanmere hidden
  in the glow of the little arbor, but he stepped into the light a minute
  later. Mary gave a little cry and then threw herself into his arms. Her
  happiness was complete.</p>

  <p>"My own dear father!" she murmured. "My own dear, dear father! Baron Von
  Wrangel has performed the miracle, and I can see again. Oh, my dear father,
  how glad you must be!"</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere looked on as one who dreams. Stanmere was holding the girl
  away so that she could see fully into his face.</p>

  <p>"Very near and yet so far from the truth," he said. "Look at me
  again."</p>

  <p>Mary did so wonderingly. She seemed to be studying some puzzling
  picture.</p>

  <p>"The same voice," she said, "the same tones, and yet so different." The
  puzzled expression left her face, her cheeks grew a little paler.</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?" she whispered. "I don't understand what it all means.
  You are&mdash;you are? Why, you are not my father at all!"</p>

  <p>Stanmere caught the girl's hands in his.</p>

  <p>"I am your uncle Paul, Lord Stanmere," he said. "Let me be the father to
  you now that I have assumed to be for the last four years."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch58"
     name="ch58"></a>LVIII. &mdash; "EYES CLEARER GROWN."</h2>

  <p>Stanmere stood there with the girl's hands in his, watching for some signs
  of anger or disgust. But there was nothing but a certain puzzled expression,
  an eager curiosity.</p>

  <p>"You mean that my father is dead?" she asked. "Please tell me. I am in the
  dark; there have been so many mysteries. And I see now that my grandmother is
  in mourning. If my father is dead&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused unsteadily. Stanmere pressed her hands again.</p>

  <p>"Your father is dead," he said, "he was killed in Cambria Square, where he
  was a guest under my roof. We had been on bad terms for years. And
  he&mdash;he died."</p>

  <p>"Please tell me the worst," Mary said. "My father was murdered?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid so. It all seems strange yet. Perhaps my words may sound
  cold. Years ago my father and brother became involved in foreign politics. I
  fancy they went very far indeed. And there was trouble over some
  conspiracy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My father betrayed his trust," Mary interrupted. There was just a
  suspicion of hardness in her speech. "I recollect that now. I did not
  understand it at the time, but I do now. It was some time before I had my
  illness, when things were going very well with us, and we lived at Stamford
  Hill. I was a little afraid of my father; he had outbursts of dangerous
  passion, and when we were poor we used to have a hard time with him. I
  recollect how good and patient my mother was. And then she died; I shall
  never forget my mother."</p>

  <p>Mary paused for a moment. The other two exchanged glances. There was no
  reason to tell Mary yet how recently the tragedy had been enacted.</p>

  <p>"A few days before I came back, or before I was sent to Stanmere four
  years ago, two men came to see my father. They were foreigners, and there was
  a great scene. I did not understand all they said, but I gathered that my
  father had done something shameful. When these men were gone I found him in a
  great state of agitation. He told me we must leave at once, because he dared
  not stay in England any longer. And when I asked why, there was a fearful
  outburst of anger that frightened me. After that I was ill, and Cecilia was
  nursing me. Then came my blindness. My father had been away. He crept back to
  the house one night and told me I might never see him again. I was to go to
  Stanmere, and if things took a turn for the better again he would send for
  me. And in the course of time he did send for me, the message saying I was to
  come with him at once and ask no questions. I was very happy at Stanmere, but
  my duty was plain and I obeyed."</p>

  <p>"It was I who sent for you," Stanmere said. "It was a desperate
  venture."</p>

  <p>"But why did you do it?" Lady Stanmere cried. "Why did you so cruelly
  deceive me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mother, I am afraid I did not consider you at the time. My brother was an
  outcast, and his child was blind. She could not see the slight difference in
  our faces, and she would not recognise the equally slight difference in our
  voices."</p>

  <p>"But I did," Mary said eagerly. "When I came back to you to Cambria Square
  I detected the difference at once. Your voice was softer than that of my
  father, except at times when you were excited or angry. And you treated me
  with a kindness and consideration that you had never before shown me. I tried
  to forget all I recollected of the past, and I succeeded. I thought that my
  father had become a better and a nobler man. You told me that you were
  prosperous, and that you had deemed it necessary to change your name to
  Spencer. All those late walks and the mystery with which you surrounded
  yourself did not arouse my suspicion, because as my real father had terrible
  enemies he would have done precisely the same thing. And yet at times I could
  not keep down the suspicion that you were somebody else."</p>

  <p>"There was something you could not understand?" Stanmere said.</p>

  <p>"There was something that made suspicion impossible," Mary said. "In
  Cambria Square I had exactly the same surroundings that I had at Notting
  Hill; my flowers, vases, pictures&mdash;everything. How could I entertain any
  lingering suspicion after that?"</p>

  <p>"But why did you do it? Why did you do it?" Lady Stanmere asked again.</p>

  <p>"I was coming to that presently," Stanmere said. "It had to be done; and,
  after all, the deceit harmed nobody. Mary, you and I have been all over the
  world together. You have trusted me implicitly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And I have not been unrewarded," Mary said. "But for the mystery and the
  moving from place to place, they were happy years. I had everything that you
  could lavish upon me; you even gave me my old home. You have been more like a
  lover than a father all the time. That is why I asked no questions. I did
  exactly as I was told, though the thought of the way I left my dear
  grandmother has always been on my conscience. And I am afraid that I
  regretted my position at times."</p>

  <p>"Nor more than was natural," Stanmere said. "And you little know what a
  tremendously powerful part you played in the drama. Without my blind girl I
  could have done nothing."</p>

  <p>"If I am to be taken into your confidence," Lady Stanmere suggested, "I
  may perhaps be permitted to ask why I also should have been kept in the
  dark?"</p>

  <p>"It was absolutely necessary, my dear mother," Stanmere replied. "I did
  not want Mary to see you. Suppose her father had died before; suppose you
  knew it and told Mary. She would naturally have asked, in that case, who I
  was. Then the whole deceit would have been prematurely divulged, and all my
  plans ruined. There was just the chance after Mary knew how she had been
  deceived, that she would refuse to return to me. You wonder why I did this
  kind of thing. I will tell you in a word; I wanted to be mistaken for
  Stephen."</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere shook her head in a puzzled kind of way.</p>

  <p>"You would not gain much by that," she suggested.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I would. I knew that Stephen was an outcast, flying from the
  vengeance that sooner or later must reach him. I learnt that he had sent his
  blind daughter down here. Stephen was out of the way, and his effects were to
  be sold by his creditors. I bought them. I was back in England then with the
  nucleus of a great fortune in my hands. But I had MY shadow dogging me, and I
  should never have carried out my plans if I had not baffled him. I bought up
  Stephen's effects, and decided to adopt his daughter. When my man fetched her
  she came, as she imagined, to her old home, or something like it. There was
  I, a speaking likeness of my poor unhappy brother Stephen, with my daughter
  by my side. The plan was a great success. The man who had meant to ruin my
  life was entirely taken in. He mistook me for Stephen grown rich and
  prosperous. I had only to avoid the broad light of the street and I was safe.
  For nearly three years my bete noir was hovering near me, and he never
  discovered the truth. And all that time I was steadily crowning the work that
  I had set myself to do."</p>

  <p>Lady Stanmere was listening with great interest now. She looked up
  swiftly.</p>

  <p>"But you stood to die by the hand that struck Stephen down," she said.</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't. Those eyes were not deceived. Besides, they were following
  Stephen from place to place on the Continent, so I was safe in that
  direction. But all the time I had a great sorrow. I had committed murder; I
  had shot a man in California in cold blood, or something like it. The
  recollection of that crime haunted me day and night; I could not rid myself
  of the picture. And the man who was looking for me everywhere knew of my
  crime. Mother, can you guess who he was?"</p>

  <p>"Horace Venner," Lady Stanmere said quietly. "The husband of poor,
  misguided Cecilia. It was a bad day when your father appointed that man to
  look after you two boys. I warned him, but he would not heed. He accompanied
  you when you last entered the house."</p>

  <p>"Until I got rid of him out in San Francisco. There was no shaking off
  that man. He saw the crime that darkened all my life committed, and that is
  why he tried to get a chance to blackmail me in England. And all the time I
  had not committed that crime at all. I had merely stunned my man, and Venner
  himself came in and completed the tragedy. But I could not know that, and I
  went in fear of him. It has only been during the last few years that
  circumstances have proved too strong for Venner and forced a confession out
  of him. If I had only known&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Stanmere paused for a moment. He had two interested listeners.</p>

  <p>"I saw him in London and he saw me," he went on. "I managed to elude him.
  It was imperative just then that Venner should be blinded as to my identity.
  To be candid, it was Martlett who suggested a way to deceive the rascal. And
  this is how you came in, Mary. If you are angry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am not in the least angry," Mary said gently. "But I think that if you
  had told me in the first place I should have been quite ready to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But we could not tell that," Stanmere went on eagerly. "Besides, you
  seemed so good and pure and incapable of playing a part. And your very
  innocence and simplicity made it so much easier. So long as you really took
  me for your father things could hardly go wrong. The scheme prospered, Venner
  was kept at bay, and I was growing rich. But there was one factor I did not
  reckon on."</p>

  <p>"Mary recovering her sight, I suppose?" Lady Stanmere asked.</p>

  <p>"No, I took her everywhere. I hunted for Von Wrangel, but after that
  affair in Berlin he seemed to have entirely disappeared. I had hoped some day
  for Mary to see again, but that is not the question. The part I had
  over-looked was the chance of Stephen turning up again."</p>

  <p>"He did turn up and he found me out. Unfortunately he believed that I had
  a hand in putting his pursuers on his track. He would have killed me just
  then if he had had a chance. My nerves gave way entirely, and I was little
  better than a wreck. Fortunately for me, Stephen could not find out where I
  lived. If he had done so my plans would have been ruined. He found me at last
  through Venner, who had followed Stephen, thinking it was me. That wants a
  little thinking out, but it is quite plain. And Venner told Stephen he knew
  all about his little place in Cambria Square. Stephen tracked me; he followed
  me down here, where I had come to see Mary privately."</p>

  <p>"But why privately?" Lady Stanmere asked.</p>

  <p>"My dear mother, if I had done so openly you would have recognised me as
  your son Paul, and Mary would have known at once that I was not her father.
  Besides, I had a shameful purpose. I was going to try and get Mary to
  postpone the operation."</p>

  <p>"Where was the need?" Mary asked.</p>

  <p>Stanmere flushed a little uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"So that you should not see for a little time longer," he said. "I was
  half mad with terror, and the knowledge that all my plans were likely to
  fail. I did not dare to trust you or anybody. It was a cruel and disgraceful
  thing not to trust you. But there was danger all around, and it was for so
  short a time. Not that I did not suffer remorse and shame. I tried to get
  Dick on my side, but he spurned the suggestion with such words as I hope
  never to have applied to me again. I tried to frighten him, but I did not
  succeed. For those few hours I think I must have been mad."</p>

  <p>"I came down here to see you, Mary, as I did the night we met in the
  corridor. Stephen was there, and he guessed my errand. He knew of this
  operation, and it was his revenge. You would see once more, Mary. I had come
  to love you dearly, and when you knew the truth you would spurn
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I shall love you all my life," Mary said gently. "There."</p>

  <p>She stood up and kissed Stanmere on the cheek fondly. There was a pleased
  smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"Then Stephen had to fly again. The danger was very real. When you found
  your way to Stanmere that night and subsequently took a walk with Von
  Wrangel, you had your hand on your father's arm. I stood in the window of the
  library personating him, so that his pursuers were entirely baffled. But we
  need not go into that at present. I only needed a few months longer before my
  work was complete. Then, by a fortunate accident, my character was cleared
  and I could face the world again. After that it did not matter how soon you
  learnt the truth, because there was no longer cause for concealment."</p>

  <p>"But I went to London," Mary said; "I had to give some kind of
  evidence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To save me from a charge of killing your father," Stanmere said. "I had
  better explain that."</p>

  <p>Mary listened as the story was told. There was a deep sadness in her
  heart, but no tears in her eyes. For she had not loved her father in the old
  days; all that love had been transferred to the man who had been by her side
  in the dark and had uplifted and comforted her.</p>

  <p>"So you forgive me?" Stanmere asked, at length.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to forgive," Mary said quietly. "I would have done all
  this for you, and more. But I should like to know what you were struggling so
  hard and running so great a risk for."</p>

  <p>Stanmere looked round him across the lake to the hanging woods beyond.</p>

  <p>"This," he said. "The restoration of the house of Stanmere."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch59"
     name="ch59"></a>LIX. &mdash; L'ENVOI.</h2>

  <p>Lady Stanmere pressed her hands together and gave a little cry.</p>

  <p>"Now I begin to understand," she said. "For some years past I have been
  growing rich. One mortgage after another has been paid off through Mr.
  Martlett. He would tell me nothing, and I was fain to take the goods that the
  gods had provided. I had heard that you were in London, Paul, and that you
  were prosperous, and I didn't know Mary was with you. I actually thought she
  was with her father all the time, and so you have done this?"</p>

  <p>"I have done all of it. It was the task I set myself to do directly I saw
  that I had a chance of fortune. I took Martlett into my confidence, and he
  managed the affair for me. When Venner came along and threatened to utterly
  ruin everything, it was he who devised the scheme in which Mary played so
  tremendous a part. Venner came near to upsetting everything, but nothing
  matters now. And all this business of the operation came, and at a critical
  time when all that I had sunk might have been lost. There is one more sum of
  money necessary to be paid and Stanmere is free. I shall be the last Lord
  Stanmere, for I shall never marry again, but the properly will be a noble
  heritage some of these days for Mary and her children."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to be a great heiress," Mary said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, you do," Stanmere smiled. "Money is a precious thing in the
  proper hands. But you and Dick will learn how to appreciate it. You won't
  have much at first, and Dick will have to put all his energies into the
  'Record,' which he shall have a share in presently."</p>

  <p>"Then you are not going to stand in Dick's way?" Mary asked. "I was afraid
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear, I have no right," Spencer said. "You are free to marry anybody
  you please. Between ourselves, I am quite delighted to find your choice falls
  on Dick. He loves you for yourself, and he would have loved you none the less
  for your condition. And but for Dick I should not be here at this moment. And
  now, let us both go back to our guests."'</p>

  <p>They crossed the terrace and entered the house. In the hall Goss was
  standing respectfully.</p>

  <p>"Lord Stanmere has come home," Lady Stanmere said. "He proposes to remain
  here in future, Goss. I am sure you will be glad to see the master back
  again."</p>

  <p>Goss forgot his dignity, and there were tears in his eyes as he took
  Stanmere's extended hand.</p>

  <p>"I don't care what happens now," he said. "I've waited for this; I always
  knew it would come. I taught you to shoot, my lord, and I taught you to ride.
  I carried you in my arms before you could walk; and I always said to my lady
  that you would come back again some day. Thank God you have."</p>

  <p>Von Wrangel, apparently sprung from nowhere, fortunately prevented any
  further weakness on the part of Goss, who averred that he had never behaved
  so shamefully before. From the corner of the dining-room Martlett was
  creeping, as musty and secretive as ever. The dry decorum broke down a little
  as Mary kissed him.</p>

  <p>"So you are a maker of romance," she said. "I have been hearing all about
  your conspiracy, sir. I believe that you are a poet in disguise. If we
  searched your office we should find novels and plays and stories there. Mr.
  Martlett, I hope you feel thoroughly ashamed of yourself?"</p>

  <p>Martlett permitted himself to indulge in the luxury of a chuckle.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," he said, in his driest fashion. "Nothing of the sort.
  I am an old-fashioned lawyer with a strong prejudice against the romantic and
  imaginative. I disclaim the scheme entirely. My client, Lord Stanmere, came
  to me in great trouble, and I merely advised him. He was good enough to
  approve of my advice and applied it. I take no credit."</p>

  <p>"And run no risks," Stanmere laughed.</p>

  <p>Martlett took a pinch of snuff in a thoughtful manner.</p>

  <p>"At the same time I don't mind making a confession," he said. "I have
  always taken a particularly warm interest in the fortunes of Stanmere; in
  fact, it has developed into a hobby of mine, like collecting postage stamps
  and other highly intellectual forms of science. If I had failed I should have
  been greatly annoyed&mdash;very much annoyed indeed. But we have not failed,
  though we came very near it. And I daresay in time you young people will
  forgive me."</p>

  <p>They were a very happy party round the tea table in the drawing-room,
  though a little subdued, for the shadow of death was still close to the
  house. Stanmere drew Dick outside the window on to the terrace presently,
  under pretence of smoking a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Have you said anything to Mary yet?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"My dear lord, as you have monopolized Mary ever since her return, it is
  perfectly obvious that I have done nothing of the kind," Dick smiled. "But
  you seem to understand each other."</p>

  <p>A little of the old anxious look came into Stanmere's eyes.</p>

  <p>"We have come to a perfect understanding," he said. "My dear Dick, you
  were right and I was wrong. I could have trusted Mary implicitly from the
  first. You perilled your position for her sake; you told me some home truths
  that I shall never forget."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that I was very rude," Dick said, with a fine color in his
  face.</p>

  <p>"You told the truth, Dick; you spoke from your heart. And I was very
  nearly threatening you with poverty and trouble again if you did not fall in
  with my views. Thank God, I was spared that humiliation. But I was half mad
  at the time. Stanmere seemed to be slipping from my grasp. My mind was going.
  But all that had been changed, as probably Von Wrangel has told you."</p>

  <p>"I fancy that I have heard everything," Dick replied.</p>

  <p>Stanmere looked to the house with its grey worn front and away to the park
  and the woods beyond.</p>

  <p>"I had set my heart on pulling through," he said. "As an atonement for all
  the follies of my youth, I resolved that Stanmere should be ours once again.
  When my father died it was a mere plank between my mother and the poorhouse.
  But step by step and stone by stone I won it back again. You can perhaps
  understand my feelings when I saw the ruins slipping through my fingers. But
  in a few weeks now it will all be mine. I shall never marry again, and by the
  time I die you will be, I hope, a man of ripe understanding, and you will be
  able to revive the old glories of the family and raise the old name again. It
  will be a noble heritage for Mary and your children."</p>

  <p>Dick gasped. He had not expected anything like this.</p>

  <p>"My dear lord," he stammered, "I could not possibly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear boy, you can't help yourself. Mary is free to marry whom she
  pleases. At first you will have a small income and earn it. The Record will
  be yours some day; you shall have a share now. We will build out a few rooms
  at Shepherd's Spring, so that the place will be fitting for the future
  mistress of Stanmere. And I hope you will not be long before you are married.
  Before my time comes, I should like to hold in my arms a boy child, whom I
  could recognise as the future lord of these old acres."</p>

  <p>Like the philosopher in the old story, Dick said nothing, for the simple
  reason that he had nothing to say. But he was eloquent enough presently, when
  he and Mary were alone together They wandered into the rose garden, which was
  one of Mary's favorite spots. And there, with Dick's arm about her, and her
  hand on his shoulder, she heard all the wonderful things that Dick had to
  tell.</p>

  <p>"It reads like a wonderful romance," Mary said, after a long pause. "I
  have lost a father, and yet I feel that my father is still with me. How
  terribly he has been tried, Dick."</p>

  <p>"He must he made much of," Dick said gravely. "He must be humored. For
  instance, he says he hopes it will not be long before we are married. We
  shall go to Shepherd's Spring for the present. My dearest girl, we really
  must not hurt Lord Stanmere by keeping him long waiting."</p>

  <p>Mary smiled up into her lover's eyes. There was a deep flush on her
  face.</p>

  <p>"Not just yet," she said. "We must wait six months. After that I am yours
  when you like to claim me, Dick. We have not known each other very long, but
  I fancy that we cared for each other from the first."</p>

  <p>"I am sure that I did," Dick declared. "When I saw you standing there that
  eventful night with the light on your face, I vowed to myself that you were
  the one girl for me. And it must have been so, because otherwise we should
  never have been thrown together in that strange manner. And when I come to
  write my book I shall not lack material."</p>

  <p>"An exciting situation," Mary said. "And that is all you want."</p>

  <p>Dick stooped and kissed the red lips.</p>

  <p>"Not quite all, sweetheart," he said. "Don't forget the heroine, lovely,
  amiable, charming and blind. What a pathetic figure? And love opens her eyes,
  and she sees again. Is it not wonderful! Could I have anything more perfect?
  My task will not be great, my darling, for it will contain the loveliest,
  daintiest, sweetest heroine that the world has ever seen."</p>
