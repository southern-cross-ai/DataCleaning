  <h3>DEDICATION<br>
  <small>AND NOTE TO THE READER</small></h3>

  <p class="note">AN irresistible impulse made me give a leading part in this
  story to a Lord Chancellor who delighted in Hegel. I fought against it, in
  vain. Well I knew that there was in the world a Lord Chancellor who read
  Hegel and was in no other respect like my Lord Chancellor. No one who knows
  the real man will for a moment imagine that my figure is meant for him,
  physically, temperamentally they are absolutely unlike. But there is always
  that provincial fool who "reads behind the lines" and who is always detecting
  "portraits" and "caricatures" in innocently creative work. Him, I warn. You
  may say, "But why not take out the figure, alter it, make it Lord Chief
  Justice for example, give it some other mental habit than the Hegelian?" That
  shows you know nothing of the art of fiction. I would rather be burnt alive
  than omit a little jest I have made about the Great Seal, and what other
  mental habit can compare with the rich Hegelian style? Who would read Bergson
  for comfort in the small hours? I would as soon dine on a boiled vegetable
  marrow, washed down with iced barley water. But Hegelian fills the mouth and
  warms the mind; it is as good as cursing. And things being so let me dedicate
  this book frankly and with affection and gratitude to that real Lord
  Chancellor who not only reads Hegel but who gave this country an army to be
  proud of, fit and ready when the moment came, who sought steadfastly to blend
  German thoroughness with our careless English fairness and who has suffered
  much foolish abuse and unreasonable criticism therefor in these wild
  patriotic times.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1">I. &mdash; YOUNG BEALBY GOES TO SHONTS</a></h2>

  <h3>&sect; 1</h3>

  <p class="first">THE cat is the offspring of a cat and the dog of a dog, but
butlers and
  lady's maids do not reproduce their kind. They have other duties.</p>

  <p>So their successors have to be sought among the prolific, and particularly
  among the prolific on great estates. Such are gardeners, but not
  under-gardeners; gamekeepers and coachmen, but not lodge people because their
  years are too great and their lodges too small. And among those to whom this
  opportunity of entering service came was young Bealby who was the stepson of
  Mr. Darling, the gardener of Shonts.</p>

  <p>Everyone knows the glories of Shonts. Its facade. Its two towers. The
  great marble pond. The terraces where the peacocks walk and the lower lake
  with the black and white swans. The great park and the avenue. The view of
  the river winding away across the blue country. And of the Shonts
  Velasquez&mdash;but that is now in America. And the Shonts Rubens, which is
  in the National Gallery. And the Shonts porcelain. And the Shonts past
  history; it was a refuge for the old faith; it had priests' holes and secret
  passages. And how at last the Marquis had to let Shonts to the
  Laxtons&mdash;the Peptonized Milk and Baby Soother people&mdash;for a long
  term of years. It was a splendid chance for any boy to begin his knowledge of
  service in so great an establishment, and only the natural perversity of
  human nature can explain the violent objection young Bealby took to anything
  of the sort. He did. He said he did not want to be a servant, and that he
  would not go and be a good boy and try his very best in that state of life to
  which it had pleased God to call him at Shonts. On the contrary.</p>

  <p>He communicated these views suddenly to his mother as she was preparing a
  steak and kidney pie in the bright little kitchen of the gardener's cottage.
  He came in with his hair all ruffled and his face hot and distinctly dirty,
  and his hands in his trousers pockets in the way he had been repeatedly told
  not to.</p>

  <p>"Mother," he said, "I'm not going to be a steward's boy at the house
  anyhow, not if you tell me to, not till you're blue in the face. So that's
  all about it."</p>

  <p>This delivered he remained panting, having no further breath left in
  him.</p>

  <p>His mother was a thin firm woman. She paused in her rolling of the dough
  until he had finished, and then she made a strong broadening sweep of the
  rolling-pin, and remained facing him, leaning forward on that implement with
  her head a little on one side.</p>

  <p>"You will do," she said, "whatsoever your father has said you will
  do."</p>

  <p>"'E isn't my father," said young Bealby.</p>

  <p>His mother gave a snapping nod of the head expressive of extreme
  determination.</p>

  <p>"Anyhow I ain't going to do it," said young Bealby, and feeling the
  conversation was difficult to sustain he moved towards the staircase door
  with a view to slamming it.</p>

  <p>"You'll do it," said his mother, "right enough."</p>

  <p>"You see whether I do," said young Bealby, and then got in his door-slam
  rather hurriedly because of steps outside.</p>

  <p>Mr. Darling came in out of the sunshine a few moments later. He was a
  large, many-pocketed, earthy-whiskered man with a clean-shaven determined
  mouth, and he carried a large pale cucumber in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I tole him," he said.</p>

  <p>"What did he say?" asked his wife.</p>

  <p>"Nuthin," said Mr. Darling.</p>

  <p>"'E says 'e won't," said Mrs. DarIng. Mr. Darling regarded her
  thoughtfully for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I never see such a boy," said Mr. Darling. "Why&mdash;'e's <i>got</i>
  to."</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 2</h3>

  <p class="first">But young Bealby maintained an obstinate fight against the
inevitable.</p>

  <p>He had no gift of lucid exposition. "I ain't going to be a servant," he
  said. "I don't see what right people have making a servant of me."</p>

  <p>"You got to be something," said Mr. Darling.</p>

  <p>"Everybody's got to be something," said Mrs. Darling.</p>

  <p>"Then let me be something else," said young Bealby.</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> dessay you'd like to be a gentleman," said Mr. Darling.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't mind," said young Bealby.</p>

  <p>"You got to be what your opportunities give you," said Mr. Darling.</p>

  <p>Young Bealby became breathless. "Why shouldn't I be an engine driver?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"All oily," said his mother. "And getting yourself killed in an accident.
  And got to pay fines. You'd <i>like</i> to be an engine driver."</p>

  <p>"Or a soldier."</p>

  <p>"Oo!&mdash;a Swaddy!" said Mr. Darling derisively.</p>

  <p>"Or the sea."</p>

  <p>"With that weak stummik of yours," said Mrs. Darling.</p>

  <p>"Besides which," said Mr. Darling, "it's been arranged for you to go up to
  the 'ouse the very first of next month. And your box and everything
  ready."</p>

  <p>Young Bealby became very red in the face. "I won't go," he said very
  faintly.</p>

  <p>"You will," said Mr. Darling, "if I 'ave to take you by the collar and the
  slack of your breeches to get you there."</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 3</h3>

  <p class="first">The heart of young Bealby was a coal of fire within his
breast
  as&mdash;unassisted&mdash;he went across the dewy park up to the great house
  whither his box was to follow him.</p>

  <p>He thought the world a "rotten show."</p>

  <p>He also said, apparently to two does and a fawn, " If you think I'm going
  to stand it, you know, you're JOLLY-well mistaken."</p>

  <p>I do not attempt to justify his prejudice against honourable usefulness in
  a domestic capacity. He had it. Perhaps there is something in the air of
  Highbury, where he had spent the past eight years of his life, that leads to
  democratic ideals. It is one of those new places where estates seem almost
  forgotten. Perhaps too there was something in the Bealby strain....</p>

  <p>I think he would have objected to any employment at all. Hitherto he had
  been a remarkably free boy with a considerable gusto about his freedom. Why
  should that end? The little village mixed school had been a soft job for his
  Cockney wits, and for a year and a half he had been top boy. Why not go on
  being top boy?</p>

  <p>Instead of which, under threats, he had to go across the sunlit corner of
  the park, through that slanting morning sunlight which had been so often the
  prelude to golden days of leafy wanderings! He had to go past the corner of
  the laundry where he had so often played cricket with the coachman's boys,
  (already swallowed up into the working world), he had to follow the laundry
  wall to the end of the kitchen and there, where the steps go down and
  underground, he had to say farewell to the sunlight, farewell to childhood,
  boyhood, freedom. He had to go down and along the stone corridor to the
  pantry, and there he had to ask for Mr. Mergleson. He paused on the top step,
  and looked up at the blue sky across which a hawk was slowly drifting. His
  eyes followed the hawk out of sight beyond a cypress bough, but indeed he was
  not thinking about the hawk, he was not seeing the hawk; he was struggling
  with a last wild impulse of his ferial nature. "Why not sling it?" his ferial
  nature was asking. "Why not even now&mdash;<i>do a bunk</i>?"</p>

  <p>It would have been better for him perhaps and better for Mr. Mergleson and
  better for Shonts if he had yielded to the whisper of the Tempter. But his
  heart was heavy within him, and he had no provisions. And never a penny. One
  can do but a very little bunk on an empty belly! "Must" was written all over
  him. He went down the steps.</p>

  <p>The passage was long and cool and at the end of it was a swing door.
  Through that and then to the left, he knew one had to go, past the stillroom
  and so to the pantry. The maids were at breakfast in the stillroom with the
  door open. The grimace he made in passing was intended rather to entertain
  than to insult, and anyhow a chap must do something with his face. And then
  he came to the pantry and into the presence of Mr. Mergleson.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mergleson was in his shirt-sleeves and generally dishevelled, having
  an early cup of tea in an atmosphere full of the bleak memories of overnight.
  He was an ample man with a large nose, a vast under lip and mutton-chop side
  whiskers. His voice would have suited a succulent parrot. He took out a gold
  watch from his waistcoat pocket and regarded it. "Ten minutes past seven,
  young man," he said, "isn't seven o'clock."</p>

  <p>Young Bealby made no articulate answer.</p>

  <p>"Just stand there for a minute," said Mr. Mergleson, "and when I'm at
  libbuty I'll run through your duties." And almost ostentatiously he gave
  himself up to the enjoyment of his cup of tea.</p>

  <p>Three other gentlemen in deshabill&eacute; sat at table with Mr.
  Mergleson. They regarded young Bealby with attention and the youngest, a red-
  haired barefaced youth in shirt-sleeves and a green apron, was moved to a
  grimace that was clearly designed to echo the scowl on young Bealby's
  features.</p>

  <p>The fury that had been subdued by a momentary awe of Mr. Mergleson revived
  and gathered force. Young Bealby's face became scarlet, his eyes filled with
  tears and his mind with the need for movement. After all&mdash;he wouldn't
  stand it. He turned round abruptly and made for the door.</p>

  <p>"Where'n earth you going to?" cried Mr. Mergleson.</p>

  <p>He's shy!" cried the second footman. Steady on!" cried the first footman
  and had him by the shoulder in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Lemme go!" howled the new recruit, struggling. "I won't be a blooming
  servant. I won't."</p>

  <p>"Here!" cried Mr. Mergleson, gesticulating with his teaspoon, "Bring 'im
  to the end of the table there. What's this about a blooming servant?"</p>

  <p>Bealby suddenly blubbering was replaced at the end of the table.</p>

  <p>"May I ask what's this about a blooming servant?" asked Mr. Mergleson.</p>

  <p>Sniff and silence.</p>

  <p>"Did I understand you to say that you ain't going to be a blooming
  servant, young Bealby?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said young Bealby.</p>

  <p>"Thomas," said Mr. Mergleson, "just smack 'is 'ed. Smack it rather
  'ard...."</p>

  <p>Things too rapid to relate occurred. "So you'd <i>bite</i>, would you?"
  said Thomas....</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Mr. Mergleson. "Got 'im! That one!"....</p>

  <p>"Just smack 'is 'ed once more," said Mr. Mergleson....</p>

  <p>"And now you just stand there, young man, until I'm at libbuty to attend
  to you further," said Mr. Mergleson, and finished his tea slowly and
  eloquently....</p>

  <p>The second footman rubbed his shin thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"If I got to smack 'is 'ed much," he said, e'd better change into his
  slippers."</p>

  <p>"Take him to 'is room," said Mr, Mergleson getting up. "See 'e washes the
  grief and grubbiness off 'is face in the handwash at the end of the passage
  and make him put on his slippers. Then show 'im 'ow to lay the table in the
  steward's room."</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 4</h3>

  <p class="first">The duties to which Bealby was introduced struck him as
perplexingly
  various, undesirably numerous, uninteresting and difficult to remember, and
  also he did not try to remember them very well because he wanted to do them
  as badly as possible, and he thought that forgetting would be a good way of
  starting at that. He was beginning at the bottom of the ladder; to him it
  fell to wait on the upper servants, and the green baize door at the top of
  the service staircase was the limit of his range. His room was a small
  wedge-shaped apartment under some steps leading to the servants' hall, lit by
  a window that did not open and that gave upon the underground passage. He
  received his instructions in a state of crumpled mutinousness, but for a day
  his desire to be remarkably impossible was more than counterbalanced by his
  respect for the large able hands of the four menservants, his seniors, and by
  a disinclination to be returned too promptly to the gardens. Then in a
  tentative manner he broke two plates, and got his head smacked by Mr.
  Mergleson himself. Mr. Mergleson gave a staccato slap quite as powerful as
  Thomas's but otherwise different. The hand of Mr. Mergleson was large and fat
  and he got his effects by dash, Thomas's was horny and lingered. After that
  young Bealby put salt in the teapot in which the housekeeper made tea. But
  that, he observed, she washed out with hot water before she put in the tea.
  It was clear that he had wasted his salt, which ought to have gone into the
  kettle.</p>

  <p>Next time&mdash;the kettle.</p>

  <p>Beyond telling him his duties almost excessively nobody conversed with
  young Bealby during the long hours of his first day in service. At midday
  dinner in the servants' hall, he made one of the kitchen-maids giggle by
  pulling faces intended to be delicately suggestive of Mr. Mergleson, but that
  was his nearest approach to disinterested human intercourse.</p>

  <p>When the hour for retirement came,&mdash;" Get out of it. Go to bed, you
  dirty little Kicker," said Thomas. "We've had about enough of you for one day
  "&mdash;young Bealby sat for a long time on the edge of his bed weighing the
  possibilities of arson and poison. He wished he had some poison. Some sort of
  poison with a medieval manner, poison that hurts before it kills. Also he
  produced a small penny pocketbook with a glazed black cover and blue edges.
  He headed one page of this " Mergleson " and entered beneath it three black
  crosses. Then he opened an account to Thomas, who was manifestly destined to
  be his principal creditor. Bealby was not a forgiving boy. At the village
  school they had been too busy making him a good Churchman to attend to things
  like that. There were a lot of crosses for Thomas.</p>

  <p>And while Bealby made these sinister memoranda downstairs Lady
  Laxton&mdash;for Laxton had bought a baronetcy for twenty thousand down to
  the party funds and a tip to the whip over the Peptonized Milk
  flotation&mdash;Lady Laxton, a couple of floors above Bealby's ruffled head,
  mused over her approaching week-end party. It was an important week-end
  party. The Lord Chancellor of England was coming. Never before had she had so
  much as a member of the Cabinet at Shonts. He was coming, and do what she
  would she could not help but connect it with her very strong desire to see
  the master of Shonts in the clear scarlet of a Deputy Lieutenant. Peter would
  look so well in that. The Lord Chancellor was coming and to meet him and to
  circle about him there were Lord John Woodenhouse and Slinker Bond, there
  were the Countess of Barracks and Mrs. Rampound Pilby, the novelist, with her
  husband Rampound Pilby, there was Professor Timbre, the philosopher, and
  there were four smaller (though quite good) people who would run about very
  satisfactorily among the others. (At least she thought they would run about
  very satisfactorily amongst the others, not imagining any evil of her cousin
  Captain Douglas.)</p>

  <p>All this good company in Shonts filled Lady Laxton with a pleasant
  realization of progressive successes, but at the same time one must confess
  that she felt a certain diffidence. In her heart of hearts she knew she had
  not made this party. It had happened to her. How it might go on happening to
  her she did not know, it was beyond her control. She hoped very earnestly
  that everything would pass off well.</p>

  <p>The Lord Chancellor was as big a guest as any she had had. One must grow
  as one grows, but still,&mdash;being easy and friendly with him would be, she
  knew, a tremendous effort. Rather like being easy and friendly with an
  elephant. She was not good at conversation. The task of interesting people
  taxed her and puzzled her....</p>

  <p>It was Slinker Bond, the whip, who had arranged the whole
  business&mdash;after, it must be confessed, a hint from Sir Peter. Laxton had
  complained that the government were neglecting this part of the country.
  "They ought to show up more than they do in the county," said Sir Peter and
  added almost carelessly, "I could easily put anybody up at Shonts." There
  were to be two select dinner parties and a large but still select Sunday
  lunch to let in the countryside to the spectacle of the Laxtons taking their
  (new) proper place at Shonts....</p>

  <p>It was not only the sense of her own deficiencies that troubled Lady
  Laxton; there were also her husband's excesses. He had&mdash;it was no use
  disguising it&mdash;rather too much the manner of an employer. He had a way
  of getting, how could one put it?&mdash;confident at dinner, and Mergleson
  seemed to delight in filling up his glass. Then he would contradict a good
  deal.... She felt that Lord Chancellors however are the sort of men one
  doesn't contradict....</p>

  <p>Then the Lord Chancellor was said to be interested in philosophy&mdash;a
  difficult subject. She had got Timbre to talk to him upon that. Timbre was a
  professor of philosophy at Oxford, so that was sure to be all right. But she
  wished she knew one or two good safe things to say in philosophy herself. She
  had long felt the need of a secretary and now she felt it more than ever. If
  she had a secretary she could just tell him what it was she wanted to talk
  about and he could get her one or two of the right books and mark the best
  passages and she could learn it all up.</p>

  <p>She feared&mdash;it was a worrying fear&mdash;that Laxton would say right
  out and very early in the week-end that he didn't believe in philosophy. He
  had a way of saying he "didn't believe in" large things like that, art,
  philanthropy, novels, and so on. Sometimes he said, "I don't believe in all
  this "&mdash;art or whatever it was. She had watched people's faces when he
  had said it and she had come to the conclusion that saying you don't believe
  in things isn't the sort of thing people say nowadays. It was wrong somehow.
  But she did not want to tell Laxton directly that it was wrong. He would
  remember if she did, but he had a way of taking such things rather badly at
  the time.... She hated him to take things badly.</p>

  <p>"If one could invent some little hint," she whispered to herself.</p>

  <p>She had often wished she was better at hints.</p>

  <p>She was, you see, a gentlewoman, modest, kindly. Her people were quite
  good people. Poor of course. But she was not clever, she was anything but
  clever. And the wives of these captains of industry need to be very clever
  indeed if they are to escape a magnificent social isolation. They get the
  titles and the big places and all that sort of thing, people don't at all
  intend to isolate them, but there is nevertheless an inadvertent
  avoidance....</p>

  <p>Even as she uttered these words, "If one could invent some little hint,"
  Bealby down there less than forty feet away through the solid floor below her
  feet and a little to the right was wetting his stump of pencil as wet as he
  could in order to ensure a sufficiently emphatic fourteenth cross on the
  score sheet of the doomed Thomas. Most of the other thirteen marks were done
  with such hard breathing emphasis that the print of them went more than
  half-way through that little blue-edged book.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 5</h3>

  <p class="first">The arrival of the week-end guests impressed Bealby at
first merely as a
  blessed influence that withdrew the four menservants into that unknown world
  on the other side of the green baize door, but then he learnt that it also
  involved the appearance of five new persons, two valets and three maids, for
  whom places had to be laid in the steward's room. Otherwise Lady Laxton's
  social arrangements had no more influence upon the mind of Bealby than the
  private affairs of the Emperor of China. There was something going on up
  there, beyond even his curiosity. All he heard of it was a distant coming and
  going of vehicles and some slight talk to which he was inattentive while the
  coachman and grooms were having a drink in the pantry&mdash;until these maids
  and valets appeared. They seemed to him to appear suddenly out of nothing
  like slugs after rain, black and rather shiny, sitting about inactively and
  quietly consuming small matters. He disliked them and they regarded him
  without affection or respect.</p>

  <p>Who cared? He indicated his feeling towards them as soon as he was out of
  the steward's room by a gesture of the hand and nose venerable only by reason
  of its antiquity.</p>

  <p>He had things more urgent to think about than strange valets and maids.
  Thomas had laid hands on him, jeered at him, inflicted shameful indignities
  on him, and he wanted to kill Thomas in some frightful manner. (But if
  possible unobtrusively.)</p>

  <p>If he had been a little Japanese boy this would have been an entirely
  honourable desire. It would have been Bushido and all that sort of thing. In
  the gardener's stepson however it is&mdash;undesirable....</p>

  <p>Thomas, on the other hand, having remarked the red light of revenge in
  Bealby's eye and being secretly afraid, felt that his honour was concerned in
  not relaxing his persecutions. He called him " icker" and when he did not
  answer to that name, he called him "Snorter," "Bleater," "nooks" and finally
  tweaked his ear. Then he saw fit to assume that Bealby was deaf and that ear-
  tweaking was the only available method of address. This led on to the
  convention of a sign language whereby ideas were communicated to Bealby by
  means of painful but frequently quite ingeniously symbolical freedoms with
  various parts of his person. Also Thomas affected to discover uncleanliness
  in Bealby's head, and succeeded after many difficulties in putting it into a
  sinkful of lukewarm water.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile young Bealby devoted such scanty time as he could give to
  reflection to debating whether it was better to attack Thomas suddenly with a
  carving knife or throw a lighted lamp. The large pantry inkpot of pewter
  might be effective in its way, he thought, but he doubted whether in the
  event of a charge it had sufficient stopping power. He was also curiously
  attracted by a long two-pronged toasting fork that hung at the side of the
  pantry fireplace. It had reach....</p>

  <p>Over all these dark thoughts and ill-concealed emotions Mr. Mergleson
  prevailed, large yet speedy, speedy yet exact, parroting orders and making
  plump gestures, performing duties and seeing that duties were performed.</p>

  <p>Matters came to a climax late on Saturday night at the end of a trying
  day, just before Mr. Mergleson went round to lock up and turn out the
  lights.</p>

  <p>Thomas came into the pantry close behind Bealby who, greatly belated
  through his own inefficiency, was carrying a tray of glasses from the
  steward's room, applied an ungentle hand to his neck, and ruffled up his back
  hair in a smart and painful manner. At the same time Thomas remarked,
  "Burrrrh!"</p>

  <p>Bealby stood still for a moment and then put down his tray on the table
  and, making peculiar sounds as he did so, resorted very rapidly to the
  toasting fork.... He got a prong into Thomas's chin at the first prod.</p>

  <p>How swift are the changes of the human soul! At the moment of his thrust
  young Bealby was a primordial savage; so soon as he saw this incredible
  piercing of Thomas's chin&mdash;for all the care that Bealby had taken it
  might just as well have been Thomas's eye&mdash;he moved swiftly through the
  ages and became a simple Christian child. He abandoned violence and fled.</p>

  <p>The fork hung for a moment from the visage of Thomas like a twisted beard
  of brass, and then rattled on the ground.</p>

  <p>Thomas clapped his hand to his chin and discovered blood.</p>

  <p>"You little&mdash;!" He never found the right word, (which perhaps is just
  as well), instead he started in pursuit of Bealby.</p>

  <p>Bealby in his sudden horror of his own act&mdash; and Thomas&mdash;fled
  headlong into the passage and made straight for the service stairs that went
  up into a higher world. He had little time to think. Thomas with a
  red-smeared chin appeared in pursuit. Thomas the avenger. Thomas really
  roused. Bealby shot through the green baize door and the pursuing footman
  pulled up only just in time not to follow him.</p>

  <p>Only just in time. He had an instinctive instant anxious fear of great
  dangers. He heard something, a sound as though the young of some very large
  animal had squeaked feebly. He had a glimpse of something black and
  white&mdash; and large....</p>

  <p>Then something, some glass thing, smashed.</p>

  <p>He steadied the green baize door which was wobbling on its brass hinges,
  controlled his panting breath and listened.</p>

  <p>A low rich voice was&mdash;ejaculating. It was not Bealby's voice, it was
  the voice of some substantial person being quietly but deeply angry. They
  were the ejaculations restrained in tone but not in quality of a ripe and
  well-stored mind,&mdash;no boy's thin stuff.</p>

  <p>Then very softly Thomas pushed open the door just widely enough to see,
  and as instantly let it fall back into place.</p>

  <p>Very gently and yet with an alert rapidity he turned about and stole down
  the service stairs.</p>

  <p>His superior officer appeared in the passage below.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mergleson," he cried, "I say&mdash;Mr. Mergleson."</p>

  <p>"What's up?" said Mr. Mergleson,</p>

  <p>"He's gone!"</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"Bealby."</p>

  <p>"Home?" This almost hopefully.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"Up there! I think he ran against somebody."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mergleson scrutinized his subordinate's face for a second. Then he
  listened intently; both men listened intently.</p>

  <p>"Have to fetch him out of that," said Mr. Mergleson suddenly preparing for
  brisk activity.</p>

  <p>Thomas bent lower over the banisters.</p>

  <p>"The Lord Chancellor!" he whispered with white lips and a sideways gesture
  of his head.</p>

  <p>"What about 'im?" said Mergleson arrested by something in the manner of
  Thomas.</p>

  <p>Thomas's whisper became so fine that Mr. Mergleson drew nearer to catch
  it. Thomas repeated the last remark. "He's just through there&mdash;on the
  landing&mdash;cursing and swearing&mdash; 'orrible things&mdash;more like a
  mad turkey than a human being."</p>

  <p>"Where's Bealby?"</p>

  <p>"He must almost 'ave run into 'im," said Thomas after consideration.</p>

  <p>"But now&mdash;where is he?"</p>

  <p>Thomas pantomimed infinite perplexity.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mergleson reflected and decided upon his line. He came up the service
  staircase, lifted his chin and with an air of meek officiousness went through
  the green door. There was no one now on the landing, there was nothing
  remarkable on the landing except a broken tumbler, but half-way up the grand
  staircase stood the Lord Chancellor. Under one arm the great jurist carried a
  soda-water syphon and he grasped a decanter of whisky in his hand. He turned
  sharply at the sound of the green baize door and bent upon Mr. Mergleson the
  most terrible eyebrows that ever surely adorned a legal visage. He was very
  red in the face and savage-looking.</p>

  <p>"Was it you," he said with a threatening gesture of the decanter and his
  voice betrayed a noble indignation, "was it you who slapped me behind?"</p>

  <p>"Slapped you behind, me lord?"</p>

  <p>"Slapped me behind. Don't I speak&mdash; plainly?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;such a libbuty, me lord!"</p>

  <p>"Idiot! I ask you a plain question."</p>

  <p>With almost inconceivable alacrity Mr. Mergleson rushed up three steps,
  leapt forward and caught the syphon as it slipped from his lordship's
  arm.</p>

  <p>He caught it, but at a price. He overset and, clasping it in his hands,
  struck his lordship first with the syphon on the left shin and then butted
  him with a face that was still earnestly respectful in the knees. His
  lordship's legs were driven sideways, so that they were no longer beneath his
  centre of gravity. With a monosyllabic remark of a topographical nature his
  lordship collapsed upon Mr. Mergleson. The decanter flew out of his grasp and
  smashed presently with emphasis upon the landing below. The syphon escaping
  from the wreckage of Mr. Mergleson and drawn no doubt by a natural affinity,
  rolled noisily from step to step in pursuit of the decanter....</p>

  <p>It was a curious little procession that hurried down the great staircase
  of Shonts that night. First the whisky like a winged harbinger with the
  pedestrian syphon in pursuit. Then the great lawyer gripping the great butler
  by the tails of his coat and punching furiously. Then Mr. Mergleson trying
  wildly to be respectful&mdash; even in disaster. First the Lord Chancellor
  dived over Mr. Mergleson grappling as he passed, then Mr. Mergleson,
  attempting explanations, was pulled backwards over the Lord Chancellor; then
  again the Lord Chancellor was for a giddy but vindictive moment uppermost; a
  second rotation and they reached the landing.</p>

  <p>Bang! There was a deafening report!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2">II. &mdash; A WEEK-END AT SHONTS</a></h2>

  <h3>&sect; 1</h3>

  <p class="first">THE week-end visit is a form of entertainment peculiar to
Great Britain.
  It is a thing that could have been possible only in a land essentially
  aristocratic and mellow, in which even the observance of the Sabbath has
  become mellow. At every London terminus on a Saturday afternoon the outgoing
  trains have an unusually large proportion of first-class carriages, and a
  peculiar abundance of rich-looking dressing-bags provoke the covetous eye. A
  discreet activity of valets and maids mingles with the stimulated alertness
  of the porters. One marks celebrities in gay raiment. There is an indefinable
  air of distinction upon platform and bookstall. Sometimes there are carriages
  reserved for especially privileged parties. There are greetings.</p>

  <p>"And so you are coming too!"</p>

  <p>"No, this time it is Shonts."</p>

  <p>"The place where they found the Rubens. Who has it now?" ....</p>

  <p>Through this cheerfully prosperous throng went the Lord Chancellor with
  his high nose, those eyebrows of his which he seemed to be able to furl or
  unfurl at will, and his expression of tranquil self-sufficiency. He was going
  to Shonts for his party and not for his pleasure, but there was no reason why
  that should appear upon his face. He went along preoccupied, pretending to
  see nobody, leaving to others the disadvantage of the greeting. In his right
  hand he carried a small important bag of leather. Under his left arm he bore
  a philosophical work by Doctor MacTaggart, three illustrated papers, the
  <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, the day's <i>Times</i>, the <i>Hibbert
  Journal</i>, <i>Punch</i> and two blue books. His lordship never quite knew
  the limits set to what he could carry under his arm. His man, Candler,
  followed therefore at a suitable distance with several papers that had
  already been dropped, alert to retrieve any further losses.</p>

  <p>At the large bookstall they passed close by Mrs. Rampound Pilby who
  according to her custom was feigning to be a member of the general public and
  was asking the clerk about her last book. The Lord Chancellor saw Rampound
  Pilby hovering at hand and deftly failed to catch his eye. He loathed the
  Rampound Pilbys. He speculated for a moment what sort of people could
  possibly stand Mrs. Pilby's vast pretensions&mdash;even from Saturday to
  Monday. One dinner party on her right hand had glutted him for life. He chose
  a corner seat, took possession of both it and the seat opposite it in order
  to have somewhere to put his feet, left Candler to watch over and pack in his
  hand luggage, and went high up the platform, remaining there with his back to
  the world&mdash;rather like a bigger more aquiline Napoleon&mdash;in order to
  evade the great novelist.</p>

  <p>In this he was completely successful.</p>

  <p>He returned however to find Candler on the verge of a personal conflict
  with a very fair young man in grey. He was so fair as to be almost an albino,
  except that his eyes were quick and brown; he was blushing the brightest pink
  and speaking very rapidly.</p>

  <p>"These two places," said Candler, breathless with the badness of his case,
  "are engaged."</p>

  <p>"Oh ve-<i>very</i> well," said the very fair young man, with his eyebrows
  and moustache looking very pale by contrast, "have it so. But do permit me to
  occupy the middle seat of the carriage. With a residuary interest in the
  semi-gentleman's place."</p>

  <p>"You little know, young man, whom you are calling a semi-gentleman," said
  Candler, whose speciality was grammar.</p>

  <p>"Here he is!" said the young gentleman.</p>

  <p>"Which place will you have, my lord?" asked Candler, abandoning his case
  altogether.</p>

  <p>"Facing," said the Lord Chancellor slowly unfurling the eyebrows and
  scowling at the young man in grey.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll have the other," said the very fair young man talking very
  glibly. He spoke with a quick low voice, like one who forces himself to keep
  going. "You see," he said, addressing the great jurist with the extreme
  familiarity of the courageously nervous, "I've gone into this sort of thing
  before. First, mind you, I have a fair look for a vacant corner. I'm not the
  sort to spoil sport. But if there isn't a vacant corner I look for traces of
  a semi-gentleman. A semi-gentleman is one who has a soft cap and not an
  umbrella&mdash;his friend in the opposite seat has the umbrella&mdash;or he
  has an umbrella and not a soft cap, or a waterproof and not a bag, or a bag
  and not a waterproof. And a half interest in a rug. That's what I call a
  semi-gentleman. You see the idea. Sort of divided beggar. Nothing in any way
  offensive."</p>

  <p>"Sir," said the Lord Chancellor, interrupting in a voice of concentrated
  passion, "I don't care a <i>rap</i> what you call a semi-gentleman.
  <i>Will</i> you get out of my way?"</p>

  <p>"Just as you please," said the very fair young man, and going a few paces
  from the carriage door he whistled for the boy with the papers. He was
  bearing up bravely.</p>

  <p><i>"Pink 'un?"</i> said the very fair young gentleman almost breathlessly.
  "<i>Black and White</i>? What's all these others? <i>Athenaeum</i>?
  <i>Sporting and Dramatic</i>? Right-O. And&mdash;Eh! What? Do I look the sort
  that buys a <i>Spectator</i>? You don't know! Do I wear galoshes? My dear
  boy, where's your <i>savoir faire</i>?"</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 2</h3>

  <p class="first">The Lord Chancellor was a philosopher and not easily
perturbed. His severe
  manner was consciously assumed and never much more than skin-deep. He had
  already furled his eyebrows and dismissed his vis-a-vis from his mind before
  the train started. He turned over the <i>Hibbert Journal</i>, and read in it
  with a large tolerance.</p>

  <p>Dimly on the outskirts of his consciousness the very fair young man
  hovered, as a trifling annoyance, as something pink and hot rustling a sheet
  of a discordant shade of pink, as something that got in the way of his legs
  and whistled softly some trivial cheerful air, just to show how little it
  cared. Presently, very soon, this vague trouble would pass out of his
  consciousness altogether....</p>

  <p>The Lord Chancellor was no mere amateur of philosophy. His activities in
  that direction were a part of his public reputation. He lectured on religion
  and aesthetics. He was a fluent Hegelian. He spent his holidays, it was
  understood, in the Absolute&mdash;at any rate in Germany. He would sometimes
  break into philosophy at dinner tables and particularly over the dessert, and
  be more luminously incomprehensible while still apparently sober, than almost
  anyone. An article in the Hibbert caught and held his attention. It attempted
  to define a new and doubtful variety of Infinity. You know of course that
  there are many sorts and species of Infinity, and that the Absolute is just
  the king among Infinities as the lion is king among the beasts....</p>

  <p>"I say," said a voice coming out of the world of Relativity and coughing
  the cough of those who break a silence, "<i>You</i> aren't going to Shonts,
  are you?"</p>

  <p>The Lord Chancellor returned slowly to earth.</p>

  <p>"Just seen your label," said the very fair young man. "You
  see,&mdash;<i>I'm</i> going to Shonts."</p>

  <p>The Lord Chancellor remained outwardly serene. He reflected for a moment.
  And then he fell into that snare which is more fatal to great lawyers and
  judges perhaps than to any other class of men, the snare of the crushing
  repartee. One had come into his head now,&mdash;a beauty.</p>

  <p>"Then we shall meet there," he said in his suavest manner.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;rather."</p>

  <p>"It would be a great pity," said the Lord Chancellor with an effective
  blandness, using a kind of wry smile that he employed to make things
  humorous, "it would be a great pity, don't you think, to anticipate that
  pleasure."</p>

  <p>And having smiled the retort well home with his head a little on one side,
  he resumed with large leisurely movements the reading of his Hibbert
  Journal.</p>

  <p>"Got me there," said the very fair young man belatedly, looking boiled to
  a turn, and after a period of restlessness settled down to an impatient
  perusal of Black and White.</p>

  <p>"There's a whole blessed week-end of course," the young man remarked
  presently without looking up from his paper and apparently pursuing some
  obscure meditations....</p>

  <p>A vague uneasiness crept into the Lord Chancellor's mind as he continued
  to appear to peruse. Out of what train of thought could such a remark arise?
  His weakness for crushing retort had a little betrayed him....</p>

  <p>It was however only when he found himself upon the platform of Chelsome,
  which as everyone knows is the station for Shonts, and discovered Mr. and
  Mrs. Rampound Pilby upon the platform, looking extraordinarily like a
  national monument and its custodian, that the Lord Chancellor began to
  realize that he was in the grip of fate, and that the service he was doing
  his party by week-ending with the Laxtons was likely to be not simply
  joyless but disagreeable.</p>

  <p>Well anyhow he had MacTaggart, and he could always work in his own
  room....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 3</h3>

  <p class="first">By the end of dinner the Lord Chancellor was almost at the
end of his
  large but clumsy endurance; he kept his eyebrows furled only by the most
  strenuous relaxation of his muscles, and within he was a sea of silent
  blasphemies. All sorts of little things had accumulated....</p>

  <p>He exercised an unusual temperance with the port and old brandy his host
  pressed upon him, feeling that he dared not relax lest his rage had its way
  with him. The cigars were quite intelligent at any rate, and he smoked and
  listened with a faintly perceptible disdain to the conversation of the other
  men. At any rate Mrs. Rampound Pilby was out of the room. The talk had arisen
  out of a duologue that had preceded the departure of the ladies, a duologue
  of Timbre's, about apparitions and the reality of the future life. Sir Peter
  Laxton, released from the eyes of his wife, was at liberty to say he did not
  believe in all this stuff; it was just thought transference and fancy and all
  that sort of thing. His declaration did not arrest the flow of feeble
  instances and experiences into which such talk invariably degenerates. His
  lordship remained carelessly attentive, his eyebrows unfurled but drooping,
  his cigar upward at an acute angle; he contributed no anecdotes, content now
  and then to express himself compactly by some brief sentence of pure
  Hegelian&mdash;much as a Mahometan might spit.</p>

  <p>"Why! come to that, they say Shonts is haunted," said Sir Peter. "I
  suppose we could have a ghost here in no time if I chose to take it on. Rare
  place for a ghost too."</p>

  <p>The very fair young man of the train had got a name now and was Captain
  Douglas. When he was not blushing too brightly he was rather good-looking. He
  was a distant cousin of Lady Laxton. He impressed the Lord Chancellor as
  unabashed. He engaged people in conversation with a cheerful familiarity that
  excluded only the Lord Chancellor, and even at the Lord Chancellor he looked
  ever and again. He pricked up his ears at the mention of ghosts, and
  afterwards when the Lord Chancellor came to think things over, it seemed to
  him that he had caught a curious glance of the Captain's bright little brown
  eye.</p>

  <p>"What sort of ghost, Sir Peter? Chains? Eh? No?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing of that sort, it seems. I don't know much about it, I wasn't
  sufficiently interested. No, sort of spook that bangs about and does you a
  mischief. What's its name? Plundergeist?"</p>

  <p>"Poltergeist," the Lord Chancellor supplied carelessly in the pause.</p>

  <p>"Runs its hand over your hair in the dark. Taps your shoulder. All
  nonsense. But we don't tell the servants. Sort of thing I don't believe in.
  Easily explained,&mdash;what with paneling and secret passages and priests'
  holes and all that."</p>

  <p>"Priests' holes!" Douglas was excited.</p>

  <p>"Where they hid. Perfect rabbit warren. There's one going out from the
  drawing-room alcove. Quite a good room in its way. But you know,"&mdash;a
  note of wrath crept into Sir Peter's voice,&mdash;"they didn't treat me
  fairly about these priests' holes. I ought to have had a sketch and a plan of
  these priests' holes. When a chap is given possession of a place, he ought to
  be given possession. Well! I don't know where half of them are myself. That's
  not possession. Else we might refurnish them and do them up a bit. I guess
  they're pretty musty."</p>

  <p>Captain Douglas spoke with his eye on the Lord Chancellor. "Sure there
  isn't a murdered priest in the place, Sir Peter?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort," said Sir Peter. "I don't believe in these priests'
  holes. Half of 'em never had priests in 'em. It's all pretty tidy rot I
  expect&mdash;come to the bottom of it...."</p>

  <p>The conversation did not get away from ghosts and secret passages until
  the men went to the drawing-room. If it seemed likely to do so Captain
  Douglas pulled it back. He seemed to delight in these silly particulars; the
  sillier they were the more he was delighted.</p>

  <p>The Lord Chancellor was a little preoccupied by one of those irrational
  suspicions that will sometimes afflict the most intelligent of men. Why did
  Douglas want to know all the particulars about the Shonts ghosts? Why every
  now and then did he glance with that odd expression at one's face&mdash;a
  glance half appealing and half amused? Amused! It was a strange fancy, but
  the Lord Chancellor could almost have sworn that the young man was laughing
  at him. At dinner he had had that feeling one has at times of being talked
  about; he had glanced along the table to discover the Captain and a rather
  plain woman, that idiot Timbre's wife she probably was, with their heads
  together looking up at him quite definitely and both manifestly pleased by
  something Douglas was telling her....</p>

  <p>What was it Douglas had said in the train? Something like a threat. But
  the exact words had slipped the Lord Chancellor's memory....</p>

  <p>The Lord Chancellor's preoccupation was just sufficient to make him a
  little unwary. He drifted into grappling distance of Mrs. Rampound Pilby. Her
  voice caught him like a lasso and drew him in.</p>

  <p>"Well, and how is Lord Moggeridge now?" she asked.</p>

  <p>What on earth is one to say to such an impertinence?</p>

  <p>She was always like that. She spoke to a man of the calibre of Lord Bacon
  as though she was speaking to a schoolboy home for the holidays. She had an
  invincible air of knowing all through everybody. It gave rather confidence to
  her work than charm to her manner.</p>

  <p>"Do you still go on with your philosophy?" she said.</p>

  <p>"No," shouted the Lord Chancellor, losing all self-control for the moment
  and waving his eyebrows about madly, "No, I go off with it."</p>

  <p>"For your vacations? Ah, Lord Moggeridge, how I envy you great lawyers
  your long vacations. 1&mdash;never get a vacation. Always we poor authors are
  pursued by our creations, sometimes it's typescript, sometimes it's proofs.
  Not that I really complain of proofs. I confess to a weakness for proofs.
  Sometimes alas! it's criticism. Such undiscerning criticism!..."</p>

  <p>The Lord Chancellor began to think very swiftly of some tremendous lie
  that would enable him to escape at once without incivility from Lady Laxton's
  drawing-room. Then he perceived that Mrs. Rampound Pilby was asking him: " Is
  that the Captain Douglas, or his brother who's in love with the actress
  woman?"</p>

  <p>The Lord Chancellor made no answer. What he thought was: " Great Silly
  Idiot! How should <i>I</i> know?"</p>

  <p>"I think it must be the one,&mdash;the one who had to leave Portsmouth in
  disgrace because of the ragging scandal. He did nothing there, they say, but
  organize practical jokes. Some of them were quite subtle practical jokes.
  He's a cousin of our hostess; that perhaps accounts for his presence...."</p>

  <p>The Lord Chancellor's comment betrayed the drift of his thoughts. "He'd
  better not try that sort of thing on here," he said. "I
  abominate&mdash;clowning."</p>

  <p>Drawing-room did not last very long. Even Lady Laxton could not miss the
  manifest gloom of her principal guest, and after the good-nights and barley
  water and lemonade on the great landing Sir Peter led Lord Moggeridge by the
  arm&mdash;he hated being led by the arm&mdash;into the small but still
  spacious apartment that was called the study. The Lord Chancellor was now
  very thirsty; he was not used to abstinence of any sort; but Sir Peter's way
  of suggesting a drink roused such a fury of resentment in him that he refused
  tersely and conclusively. There was nobody else in the study but Captain
  Douglas, who seemed to hesitate upon the verge of some familiar address, and
  Lord Woodenhouse who was thirsty too, and held a vast tumbler of whisky and
  soda, with a tinkle of ice in it, on his knee in a way annoying to a parched
  man. The Lord Chancellor helped himself to a cigar and assumed the middle of
  the fireplace with an air of contentment, but he could feel the self-control
  running out of the heels of his boots.</p>

  <p>Sir Peter after a quite unsuccessful invasion of his own
  hearthrug&mdash;the Lord Chancellor stood like a rock&mdash;secured the big
  armchair, stuck his feet out towards his distinguished guest and resumed a
  talk that he had been holding with Lord Woodenhouse about firearms. Mergleson
  had as usual been too attentive to his master's glass, and the fine edge was
  off Sir Peter's deference. "I always have carried firearms," he said, "and I
  always shall. Used properly they are a great protection. Even in the country
  how are you to know who you're going to run up against&mdash;any when?"</p>

  <p>"But you might shoot and hit something," said Douglas.</p>

  <p>"Properly used, I said&mdash;properly used. Whipping out a revolver and
  shooting at a man, that's not properly used. Almost as bad as pointing it at
  him&mdash;which is pretty certain to make him fly straight at you. If he's
  got an ounce of pluck. But <i>I</i> said properly used and I <i>mean</i>
  properly used."</p>

  <p>The Lord Chancellor tried to think about that article on Infinities, while
  appearing to listen to this fool's talk. He despised revolvers. Armed with
  such eyebrows as his it was natural for him to despise revolvers.</p>

  <p>"Now, I've got some nice little barkers upstairs," said Sir Peter. "I'd
  almost welcome a burglar, just to try them."</p>

  <p>"If you shoot a burglar," said Lord Woodenhouse abruptly, with a gust of
  that ill-temper that was frequent at Shonts towards bed-time, "when he's not
  attacking you, it s murder."</p>

  <p>Sir Peter held up an offensively pacifying hand. "I know <i>that</i>," he
  said, "you needn't tell me <i>that</i>."</p>

  <p>He raised his voice a little to increase his already excessive
  accentuations. "<i>I</i> said properly used."</p>

  <p>A yawn took the Lord Chancellor unawares and he caught it dexterously with
  his hand. Then he saw Douglas hastily pull at his little blonde moustache to
  conceal a smile,&mdash;grinning ape! What was there to smile at? The man had
  been smiling all the evening.</p>

  <p>Up to something?</p>

  <p>"Now let me tell you," said Sir Peter, "let me tell you the proper way to
  use a revolver. You whip it out and instantly let fly at the ground. You
  should never let anyone see a revolver ever before they hear it&mdash;see?
  You let fly at the ground first off, and the concussion stuns them. It
  doesn't stun you. You expect it, they don't. See? There you are&mdash;five
  shots left, master of the situation."</p>

  <p>"I think, Sir Peter, I'll bid you good-night," said the Lord Chancellor,
  allowing his eye to rest for one covetous moment on the decanter and
  struggling with the devil of pride.</p>

  <p>Sir Peter made a gesture of extreme friendliness from his chair,
  expressive of the Lord Chancellor's freedom to do whatever he pleased at
  Shonts. "I may perhaps tell you a little story that happened once in
  Morocco."</p>

  <p>"My eyes won't keep open any longer," said Captain Douglas suddenly, with
  a whirl of his knuckles into his sockets, and stood up.</p>

  <p>Lord Woodenhouse stood up too.</p>

  <p>"You see," said Sir Peter, standing also but sticking to his subject and
  his hearer. "This was when I was younger than I am now, you must understand,
  and I wasn't married. Just mooching about a bit, between business and
  pleasure. Under such circumstances one goes into parts of a foreign town
  where one wouldn't go if one was older and wiser...."</p>

  <p>Captain Douglas left Sir Peter and Woodenhouse to it.</p>

  <p>He emerged on the landing and selected one of the lighted candlesticks
  upon the table. "Lord!" he whispered. He grimaced in soliloquy and then
  perceived the Lord Chancellor regarding him with suspicion and disfavour from
  the ascending staircase. He attempted ease. For the first time since the
  train incident he addressed Lord Moggeridge.</p>

  <p>"I gather, my lord, you don't believe in ghosts?" he said.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the Lord Chancellor, "I don't."</p>

  <p>"They won't trouble me to-night."</p>

  <p>"They won't trouble any of us."</p>

  <p>"Fine old house anyhow," said Captain Douglas.</p>

  <p>The Lord Chancellor disdained to reply. He went on his way
  upstairs.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 4</h3>

  <p class="first">When the Lord Chancellor sat down before the thoughtful
fire in the fine
  old panelled room assigned to him he perceived that he was too disturbed to
  sleep. This was going to be an infernal week-end. The worst week-end he had
  ever had. Mrs. Rampound Pilby maddened him; Timbre, who was a
  Pragmatist&mdash;which stands in the same relation to a Hegelian that a small
  dog does to a large cat&mdash;exasperated him; he loathed Laxton, detested
  Rampound Pilby and feared&mdash;as far as he was capable of fearing
  anything&mdash;Captain Douglas. There was no refuge, no soul in the house to
  whom he could turn for consolation and protection from these others. Slinker
  Bond could talk only of the affairs of the party, and the Lord Chancellor,
  being Lord Chancellor, had lost any interest in the affairs of the party;
  Woodenhouse could talk of nothing. The women were astonishingly negligible.
  There were practically no pretty women. There ought always to be pretty young
  women for a Lord Chancellor, pretty young women who can at least seem to
  listen....</p>

  <p>And he was atrociously thirsty.</p>

  <p>His room was supplied only with water,&mdash; stuff you use to clean your
  teeth&mdash;and nothing</p>

  <p>No good thinking about it....</p>

  <p>He decided that the best thing he could do to compose himself before
  turning in would be to sit down at the writing-table and write a few sheets
  of Hegelian&mdash;about that Infinity article in the <i>Hibbert</i>. There is
  indeed no better consolation for a troubled mind than the Hegelian exercises;
  they lift it above&mdash;everything. He took off his coat and sat down to
  this beautiful amusement, but he had scarcely written a page before his
  thirst became a torment. He kept thinking of that great tumbler Woodenhouse
  had held,&mdash;sparkling, golden, cool&mdash;and stimulating.</p>

  <p>What he wanted was a good stiff whisky and a cigar, one of Laxton's
  cigars, the only good thing in his entertainment so far.</p>

  <p>And then Philosophy.</p>

  <p>Even as a student he had been a worker of the Teutonic type,&mdash;never
  abstemious.</p>

  <p>He thought of ringing and demanding these comforts, and then it occurred
  to him that it was a little late to ring for things. Why not fetch them from
  the study himself?....</p>

  <p>He opened his door and looked out upon the great staircase. It was a fine
  piece of work, that staircase. Low, broad, dignified....</p>

  <p>There seemed to be nobody about. The lights were still on. He listened for
  a little while, and then put on his coat and went with a soft swiftness that
  was still quite dignified downstairs to the study, the study redolent of Sir
  Peter.</p>

  <p>He made his modest collection.</p>

  <p>Lord Moggeridge came nearer to satisfaction as he emerged from the study
  that night at Shonts than at any other moment during this ill-advised
  week-end. In his pocket were four thoroughly good cigars. In one hand he held
  a cut glass decanter of whisky. In the other a capacious tumbler. Under his
  arm, with that confidence in the unlimited portative power of his arm that
  nothing could shake, he had tucked the syphon. His soul rested upon the edge
  of tranquillity like a bird that has escaped the fowler. He was already
  composing his next sentence about that new variety of Infinity....</p>

  <p>Then something struck him from behind and impelled him forward a couple of
  paces. It was something hairy, something in the nature, he thought
  afterwards, of a worn broom. And also there were two other things softer and
  a little higher on each side....</p>

  <p>Then it was he made that noise like the young of some large animal.</p>

  <p>He dropped the glass in a hasty attempt to save the syphon....</p>

  <p>"What in the name of Heavens?" he</p>

  <p>cried, and found himself alone.</p>

  <p>"Captain Douglas!"</p>

  <p>The thought leapt to his mind.</p>

  <p>But indeed it was not Captain Douglas. It was Bealby. Bealby in panic
  flight from Thomas. And how was Bealby to know that this large, richly laden
  man was the Lord Chancellor of England? Never before had Bealby seen anyone
  in evening dress except a butler, and so he supposed this was just some
  larger, finer kind of butler that they kept upstairs. Some larger, finer kind
  of butler blocking the path of escape. Bealby had taken in the situation with
  the rapidity of a hunted animal. The massive form blocked the door to the
  left....</p>

  <p>In the playground of the village school Bealby had been pre-eminent for
  his dodging; he moved as quickly as a lizard. His little hands, his head,
  poised with the skill of a practised butter, came against that mighty back,
  and then Bealby had dodged into the study....</p>

  <p>But it seemed to Lord Moggeridge, staggering over his broken glass and
  circling about defensively, that this fearful indignity could come only from
  Captain Douglas. Foolery.... Blup, blup.... Sham Poltergeist.
  Imbeciles....</p>

  <p>He said as much, believing that this young man and possibly confederates
  were within hearing; he said as much&mdash;hotly. He went on to remarks of an
  unphilosophical tendency about Captain Douglas generally, and about army
  officers, practical joking, Laxton's hospitalities, Shonts.... Thomas, you
  will remember, heard him....</p>

  <p>Nothing came of it. No answer, not a word of apology.</p>

  <p>At last in a great dudgeon and with a kind of wariness about his back, the
  Lord Chancellor, with things more spoilt for him than ever, went on his way
  upstairs.</p>

  <p>When the green baize door opened behind him, he turned like a shot, and a
  large foolish-faced butler appeared. Lord Moggeridge with a sceptre-like
  motion of the decanter very quietly and firmly asked him a simple question
  and then, then the lunatic must needs leap up three stairs and dive suddenly
  and upsettingly at his legs.</p>

  <p>Lord Moggeridge was paralysed with amazement. His legs were struck from
  under him. He uttered one brief topographical cry.</p>

  <p>(To Sir Peter unfortunately it sounded like "Help! ")</p>

  <p>For a few seconds the impressions that rushed upon Lord Moggeridge were
  too rapid for adequate examination. He had a compelling fancy to kill
  butlers. Things culminated in a pistol shot. And then he found himself
  sitting on the landing beside a disgracefully dishevelled manservant, and his
  host was running downstairs to them with a revolver in his hand.</p>

  <p>On occasion Lord Moggeridge could produce a tremendous voice. He did so
  now. For a moment he stared panting at Sir Peter, and then emphasized by a
  pointing finger came the voice. Never had it been so charged with
  emotion.</p>

  <p>"What does this mean, you, sir?" he shouted. "What does this mean?"</p>

  <p>It was exactly what Sir Peter had intended to say.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 5</h3>

  <p class="first">Explanations are detestable things. And anyhow it isn't
right to address
  your host as "You, sir."</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 6</h3>

  <p class="first">Throughout the evening the persuasion had grown in Lady
Laxton's mind that
  all was not going well with the Lord Chancellor. It was impossible to believe
  he was enjoying himself. But she did not know how to give things a turn for
  the better. Clever women would have known, but she was so convinced she was
  not clever that she did not even try.</p>

  <p>Thing after thing had gone wrong.</p>

  <p>How was she to know that there were two sorts of philosophy&mdash;quite
  different? She had thought philosophy was philosophy. But it seemed that
  there were these two sorts, if not more; a round large sort that talked about
  the Absolute and was scornfully superior and rather irascible, and a
  jabby-pointed sort that called people " Tender " or " Tough," and was
  generally much too familiar. To bring them together was just mixing trouble.
  There ought to be little books for hostesses explaining these things....</p>

  <p>Then it was extraordinary that the Lord Chancellor who was so tremendously
  large and clever wouldn't go and talk to Mrs. Rampound Pilby who was also so
  tremendously large and clever. Repeatedly Lady Laxton had tried to get them
  into touch with one another. Until at last the Lord Chancellor had said
  distinctly and deliberately, when she had suggested his going across to the
  eminent writer, "God forbid!" Her dream of a large clever duologue that she
  could afterwards recall with pleasure was altogether shattered. She thought
  the Lord Chancellor uncommonly hard to please. These weren't the only people
  for him. Why couldn't he "chat party secrets" with Slinker Bond or say things
  to Lord Woodenhouse? You could say anything you liked to Lord Woodenhouse. Or
  talk with Mr. Timbre. Mrs. Timbre had given him an excellent opening; she had
  asked, wasn't it a dreadful anxiety always to have the Great Seal to mind? He
  had simply grunted.... And then why did he keep on looking so dangerously at
  Captain Douglas?....</p>

  <p>Perhaps to-morrow things would take a turn for the better....</p>

  <p>One can at least be hopeful. Even if one is not clever one can be
  that....</p>

  <p>From such thoughts as these it was that this unhappy hostess was roused by
  a sound of smashing glass, a rumpus, and a pistol shot.</p>

  <p>She stood up, she laid her hand on her heart, she said " Oh!" and gripped
  her dressing-table for support....</p>

  <p>After a long time and when it seemed that it was now nothing more than a
  hubbub of voices, in which her husband's could be distinguished clearly, she
  crept out very softly upon the upper landing.</p>

  <p>She perceived her cousin. Captain Douglas, looking extremely fair and
  frail and untrustworthy in a much too gorgeous kimono dressing-gown of
  embroidered Japanese silk. "I can assure you, my lord," he was saying in a
  strange high-pitched deliberate voice, "on my word of honour as a soldier, on
  my word of honour as a soldier, that I know absolutely nothing about it."</p>

  <p>"Sure it wasn't all imagination, my lord?" Sir Peter asked with his
  inevitable infelicity...</p>

  <p>She decided to lean over the balustrading and ask very quietly and
  clearly:</p>

  <p>"Lord Moggeridge, please! is anything the matter?"</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 7</h3>

  <p class="first">All human beings are egotists, but there is no egotism to
compare with the
  egotism of the very young.</p>

  <p>Bealby was so much the centre of his world that he was incapable of any
  interpretation of this shouting and uproar, this smashing of decanters and
  firing of pistol shots, except in reference to himself. He supposed it to be
  a Hue and Cry. He supposed that he was being hunted&mdash;hunted by a pack of
  great butlers hounded on by the irreparably injured Thomas. The thought of
  upstairs gentlefolks passed quite out of his mind. He snatched up a faked
  Syrian dagger that lay, in the capacity of a paper knife, on the study table,
  concealed himself under the chintz valance of a sofa, adjusted its rumpled
  skirts neatly, and awaited the issue of events.</p>

  <p>For a time events did not issue. They remained talking noisily upon the
  great staircase. Bealby could not hear what was said, but most of what was
  said appeared to be flat contradiction.</p>

  <p>"Perchance," whispered Bealby to himself, gathering courage, "perchance we
  have eluded them.... A breathing space...."</p>

  <p>At last a woman's voice mingled with the others and seemed a little to
  assuage them....</p>

  <p>Then it seemed to Bealby that they were dispersing to beat the house for
  him. "Goodnight again then," said someone.</p>

  <p>That puzzled him, but he decided it was a "blind." He remained very, very
  still.</p>

  <p>He heard a choking in the apartment&mdash;the blue parlour it was
  called&mdash;between the study and the dining-room. Electric light?</p>

  <p>Then someone came into the study. Bealby's eye was as close to the ground
  as he could get it. He was breathless, he moved his head with an immense
  circumspection. The valance was translucent but not transparent, below it
  there was a crack of vision, a strip of carpet, the castors of chairs. Among
  these things he perceived feet&mdash;not ankles, it did not go up to that,
  but just feet. Large flatfish feet. A pair. They stood still, and Bealby's
  hand lighted on the hilt of his dagger.</p>

  <p>The person above the feet seemed to be surveying the room&mdash;or
  reflecting.</p>

  <p>"Drunk!... Old fool's either drunk or mad! That's about the truth of it,"
  said a voice.</p>

  <p>Mergleson! Angry, but parroty and unmistakable.</p>

  <p>The feet went across to the table and there were faint sounds of
  refreshment, discreetly administered. Then a moment of profound
  stillness....</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said the voice at last, a voice renewed.</p>

  <p>Then the feet went to the passage door, halted in the doorway. There was a
  double click. The lights went out. Bealby was in absolute darkness.</p>

  <p>Then a distant door closed and silence followed upon the dark....</p>

  <p>Mr. Mergleson descended to a pantry ablaze with curiosity.</p>

  <p>"The Lord Chancellor's going dotty," said Mr. Mergleson replying to the
  inevitable question. "That's what's up?" ....</p>

  <p>"I tried to save the blessed syphon," said Mr. Mergleson pursuing his
  narrative, "and 'e sprang on me like a leppard. I suppose 'e thought I wanted
  to take it away from 'im., 'E'd broke a glass already. 'Ow,&mdash;I don't
  know. There it was, lying on the landing...."</p>

  <p>"'Ere's where 'e bit my 'and," said Mr. Mergleson....</p>

  <p>A curious little side-issue occurred to Thomas. "Where's young Kicker all
  this time?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Lord!" said Mr. Mergleson, "all them other things, they clean drove 'im
  out of my 'ed. I suppose 'e's up there, hiding somewhere...."</p>

  <p>He paused. His eye consulted the eye of Thomas.</p>

  <p>"'E's got be'ind a curtain or something," said Mr. Mergleson....</p>

  <p>"Queer where 'e can 'ave got to," said Mr. Mergleson....</p>

  <p>"Can't be bothered about 'im," said Mr. Mergleson.</p>

  <p>"I expect he'll sneak down to 'is room when things are quiet," said
  Thomas, after reflection.</p>

  <p>"No good going and looking for 'im now," said Mr. Mergleson. "Things
  upstairs,&mdash;they got to settle down...."</p>

  <p>But in the small hours Mr. Mergleson awakened and thought of Bealby and
  wondered whether he was in bed. This became so great an uneasiness that about
  the hour of dawn he got up and went along the passage to Bealby' s
  compartment. Bealby was not there and his bed had not been slept in.</p>

  <p>That sinister sense of gathering misfortunes which comes to all of us at
  times in the small hours, was so strong in the mind of Mr. Mergleson that he
  went on and told Thomas of this disconcerting fact. Thomas woke with
  difficulty and rather crossly, but sat up at last, alive to the gravity of
  Mr. Mergleson' s mood.</p>

  <p>"If 'e's found hiding about upstairs after all this upset," said Mr.
  Mergleson, and left the rest of the sentence to a sympathetic
  imagination.</p>

  <p>"Now it's light," said Mr. Mergleson after a slight pause, "I think we
  better just go round and 'ave a look for 'im. Both of us."</p>

  <p>So Thomas clad himself provisionally, and the two menservants went
  upstairs very softly and began a series of furtive sweeping movements&mdash;
  very much in the spirit of Lord Kitchener's historical sweeping movements in
  the Transvaal&mdash; through the stately old rooms in which Bealby must be
  lurking....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 8</h3>

  <p class="first">Man is the most restless of animals. There is an incessant
urgency in his
  nature. He never knows when he is well off. And so it was that Bealby' s
  comparative security under the sofa became presently too irksome to be
  endured. He seemed to himself to stay there for ages, but as a matter of
  fact, he stayed there only twenty minutes. Then with eyes tempered to the
  darkness he first struck out an alert attentive head, then crept out and
  remained for the space of half a minute on all fours surveying the indistinct
  blacknesses about him.</p>

  <p>Then he knelt up. Then he stood up. Then with arms extended and cautious
  steps he began an exploration of the apartment.</p>

  <p>The passion for exploration grows with what it feeds upon. Presently
  Bealby was feeling his way into the blue parlour and then round by its
  shuttered and curtained windows to the dining-room. His head was now full of
  the idea of some shelter, more permanent, less pervious to housemaids than
  that sofa. He knew enough now of domestic routines to know that upstairs in
  the early morning was much routed about by housemaids. He found many
  perplexing turns and corners, and finally got into the dining-room fireplace
  where it was very dark and kicked against some fireirons. That made his heart
  beat fast for a time. Then groping on past it, he found in the darkness what
  few people could have found in the day, the stud that released the panel that
  hid the opening of the way that led to the priest hole. He felt the thing
  open, and halted perplexed. In that corner there wasn't a ray of light. For a
  long time he was trying to think what this opening could be, and then he
  concluded it was some sort of back way from downstairs.... Well, anyhow it
  was all exploring. With an extreme gingerliness he got himself through the
  panel. He closed it almost completely behind him.</p>

  <p>Careful investigation brought him to the view that he was in a narrow
  passage of brick or stone that came in a score of paces to a spiral staircase
  going both up and down. Up this he went, and presently breathed cool night
  air and had a glimpse of stars through a narrow slit-like window almost
  blocked by ivy. Then &mdash;what was very disagreeable&mdash;something
  scampered.</p>

  <p>When Bealby's heart recovered he went on up again.</p>

  <p>He came to the priest hole, a capacious cell six feet square with a bench
  bed and a little table and chair. It had a small door upon the stairs that
  was open and a niche cupboard. Here he remained for a time. Then restlessness
  made him explore a cramped passage, he had to crawl along it for some yards,
  that came presently into a curious space with wood on one side and stone on
  the other. Then ahead, most blessed thing! he saw light.</p>

  <p>He went blundering towards it and then stopped appalled. From the other
  side of this wooden wall to the right of him had come a voice.</p>

  <p>"Come in!" said the voice. A rich masculine voice that seemed scarcely two
  yards away.</p>

  <p>Bealby became rigid. Then after a long interval he moved&mdash;as softly
  as he could.</p>

  <p>The voice soliloquized.</p>

  <p>Bealby listened intently, and then when all was still again crept forward
  two paces more towards the gleam. It was a peephole.</p>

  <p>The unseen speaker was walking about. Bealby listened, and the sound of
  his beating heart mingled with the pad, pad, of slippered footsteps. Then
  with a brilliant effort his eye was at the chink. All was still again. For a
  time he was perplexed by what he saw, a large pink shining dome, against a
  deep greenish grey background. At the base of the dome was a kind of
  interrupted hedge, brown and leafless,....</p>

  <p>Then he realized that he was looking at the top of a head and two enormous
  eyebrows. The rest was hidden....</p>

  <p>Nature surprised Bealby into a penetrating sniff.</p>

  <p>"Now," said the occupant of the room, and suddenly he was standing
  up&mdash;Bealby saw a long hairy neck sticking out of a dressing-gown&mdash;
  and walking to the side of the room. "I won't stand it," said the great
  voice, "I won't stand it. Ape's foolery!"</p>

  <p>Then the Lord Chancellor began rapping at the panelling about his
  apartment.</p>

  <p>"Hollow! It all sounds hollow."</p>

  <p>Only after a long interval did he resume his writing....</p>

  <p>All night long that rat behind the wainscot troubled the Lord Chancellor.
  Whenever he spoke, whenever he moved about it was still; whenever he composed
  himself to write it began to rustle and blunder. Again and again it
  sniffed,&mdash;an annoying kind of sniff. At last the Lord Chancellor gave up
  his philosophical relaxation and went to bed, turned out the lights and
  attempted sleep, but this only intensified his sense of an uneasy, sniffing
  presence close to him. When the light was out it seemed to him that this
  Thing, whatever it was, instantly came into the room and set the floor
  creaking and snapping. A Thing perpetually attempting something and
  perpetually thwarted....</p>

  <p>The Lord Chancellor did not sleep a wink. The first feeble infiltration of
  day found him sitting up in bed, wearily wrathful.... And now surely someone
  was going along the passage outside!</p>

  <p>A great desire to hurt somebody very much seized upon the Lord Chancellor.
  Perhaps he might hurt that dismal farceur upon the landing! No doubt it was
  Douglas sneaking back to his own room after the night's efforts.</p>

  <p>The Lord Chancellor slipped on his dressing-gown of purple silk. Very
  softly indeed did he open his bedroom door and very warily peep out. He heard
  the soft pad of feet upon the staircase.</p>

  <p>He crept across the broad passage to the beautiful old balustrading. Down
  below he saw Mergleson&mdash;Mergleson again!&mdash;in a shameful
  deshabille&mdash;going like a snake, like a slinking cat, like an assassin,
  into the door of the study. Rage filled the great man's soul. Gathering up
  the skirts of his dressing-gown he started in a swift yet noiseless
  pursuit.</p>

  <p>He followed Mergleson through the little parlour and into the dining-
  room, and then he saw it all! There was a panel open, and Mergleson very
  cautiously going in. Of course! They had got at him through the priest hole.
  They had been playing on his nerves. All night they had been doing
  it&mdash;no doubt in relays. The whole house was in this conspiracy.</p>

  <p>With his eyebrows spread like the wings of a fighting-cock the Lord
  Chancellor in five vast noiseless strides had crossed the intervening space
  and gripped the butler by his collarless shirt as he was disappearing. It was
  like a hawk striking a sparrow. Mergleson felt himself clutched, glanced over
  his shoulder and, seeing that fierce familiar face again close to his own,
  pitiless, vindictive, lost all sense of human dignity and yelled like a lost
  soul....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 9</h3>

  <p class="first">Sir Peter Laxton was awakened from an uneasy sleep by the
opening of the
  dressing-room door that connected his room with his wife's.</p>

  <p>He sat up astonished and stared at her white face, its pallor exaggerated
  by the cold light of dawn.</p>

  <p>"Peter," she said, "I'm sure there's something more going on."</p>

  <p>"Something more going on?"</p>

  <p>"Something&mdash;shouting and swearing."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. "The Lord Chancellor," she said, in an awe-stricken whisper.
  "He's at it again. Downstairs in the dining-room."</p>

  <p>Sir Peter seemed disposed at first to receive this quite passively. Then
  he flashed into extravagant wrath. "I'm damned," he cried, jumping violently
  out of bed, "if I'm going to stand this! Not if he was a hundred Lord
  Chancellors! He's turning the place into a bally lunatic asylum.
  Once&mdash;one might excuse. But to start in again.... What' s that?"</p>

  <p>They both stood still listening. Faintly yet quite distinctly came the
  agonized cry of some imperfectly educated person&mdash;" 'Elp!"</p>

  <p>"Here! Where's my trousers?" cried Sir Peter. "He's murdering Mergleson.
  There isn't a moment to lose."</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 10</h3>

  <p class="first">Until Sir Peter returned Lady Laxton sat quite still just
as he had left
  her on his bed, aghast.</p>

  <p>She could not even pray.</p>

  <p>The sun had still to rise; the room was full of that cold weak inky light,
  light without warmth, knowledge without faith, existence without courage,
  that creeps in before the day. She waited.... In such a mood women have
  waited for massacre....</p>

  <p>Downstairs a raucous shouting....</p>

  <p>She thought of her happy childhood upon the Yorkshire wolds, before the
  idea of weekend parties had entered her mind. The heather. The little birds.
  Kind things. A tear ran down her cheek....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 11</h3>

  <p class="first">Then Sir Peter stood before her again, alive still, but
breathless and
  greatly ruffled.</p>

  <p>She put her hands to her heart. She would be brave.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said. "Tell me."</p>

  <p>"He's as mad as a hatter," said Sir Peter.</p>

  <p>She nodded for more. She knew that.</p>

  <p>"Has he&mdash;killed anyone?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"He looked uncommonly like trying," said Sir Peter.</p>

  <p>She nodded, her lips tightly compressed. "Says Douglas will either have to
  leave the house or he does." "But&mdash;Douglas!"</p>

  <p>"I know, but he won't hear a word." "But why Douglas?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you he's as mad as a hatter. Got persecution mania. People tapping
  and bells ringing under his pillow all night&mdash;that sort of idea.... And
  furious. I tell you,&mdash;he frightened me. He was awful. He's given
  Mergleson a black eye. Hit him, you know. With his fist. Caught him in the
  passage to the priest hole&mdash;how they got there <i>I</i> don't
  know&mdash;and went for him like a madman."</p>

  <p>"But what has Douglas done?"</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> don't know. I asked him, but he won't listen. He's just off his
  head.... Says Douglas has got the whole household trying to work a ghost on
  him. I tell you&mdash;he's off his nut."</p>

  <p>Husband and wife looked at each other....</p>

  <p>"Of course if Douglas didn't mind just going off to oblige me," said Sir
  Peter at last....</p>

  <p>"It might calm him," he explained.... "You see, it's all so infernally
  awkward...."</p>

  <p>"Is he back in his room?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Waiting for me to decide about Douglas. Walking up and down."</p>

  <p>For a little while their minds remained prostrate and inactive.</p>

  <p>"I'd been so looking forward to the lunch," she said with a joyless smile.
  "The county "</p>

  <p>She could not go on.</p>

  <p>"You know," said Sir Peter, "one thing,&mdash; I'll see to it myself I
  won't have him have a single drop of liquor more. If we have to search his
  room."</p>

  <p>"What I shall say to him at breakfast," she said, "I don't know."</p>

  <p>Sir Peter reflected. "There's no earthly reason why you should be brought
  into it at all. Your line is to know nothing about it. Show him you know
  nothing about it. Ask him&mdash; ask him if he's had a good night... "</p>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3">III. &mdash; THE WANDERERS</a></h2>

  <h3>&sect; 1</h3>

  <p class="first">NEVER had the gracious eastward face of Shonts looked more
beautiful than
  it did on the morning of the Lord Chancellor's visit. It glowed as
  translucent as amber lit by flames, its two towers were pillars of pale gold.
  It looked over its slopes and parapets upon a great valley of mist-barred
  freshness through which the distant river shone like a snake of light. The
  south-west facade was still in the shadow, and the ivy hung from it darkly
  greener than the greenest green. The stained-glass windows of the old chapel
  reflected the sunrise as though lamps were burning inside. Along the terrace
  a pensive peacock trailed his sheathed splendours through the dew.</p>

  <p>Amidst the ivy was a fuss of birds.</p>

  <p>And presently there was pushed out from amidst the ivy at the foot of the
  eastward tower a little brownish buff thing, that seemed as</p>

  <p>natural there as a squirrel or a rabbit. It was a head,&mdash;a ruffled
  human head. It remained still for a moment contemplating the calm
  spaciousness of terrace and garden and countryside. Then it emerged farther
  and rotated and surveyed the house above it. Its expression was one of alert
  caution. Its natural freshness and innocence were a little marred by an
  enormous transverse smudge, a bar-sinister of smut, and the elfin delicacy of
  the left ear was festooned with a cobweb&mdash;probably a genuine antique. It
  was the face of Bealby.</p>

  <p>He was considering the advisability of leaving Shonts&mdash;for good.</p>

  <p>Presently his decision was made. His hands and shoulders appeared
  following his head, and then a dusty but undamaged Bealby was running swiftly
  towards the corner of the shrubbery. He crouched lest at any moment that
  pursuing pack of butlers should see him and give tongue. In another moment he
  was hidden from the house altogether, and rustling his way through a thicket
  of budding rhododendra. After those dirty passages the morning air was
  wonderfully sweet&mdash;but just a trifle hungry.</p>

  <p>Grazing deer saw Bealby fly across the park, stared at him for a time with
  great gentle unintelligent eyes, and went on feeding.</p>

  <p>They saw him stop ever and again. He was snatching at mushrooms, that he
  devoured forthwith as he sped on.</p>

  <p>On the edge of the beech-woods he paused and glanced back at Shonts.</p>

  <p>Then his eyes rested for a moment on the clump of trees through which one
  saw a scrap of the head gardener's cottage, a bit of the garden wall....</p>

  <p>A physiognomist might have detected a certain lack of self-confidence in
  Bealby's eyes.</p>

  <p>But his spirit was not to be quelled. Slowly, joylessly perhaps, but with
  a grave determination, he raised his hand in that prehistoric gesture of the
  hand and face by which youth, since ever there was youth, has asserted the
  integrity of its soul against established and predominant things.</p>

  <p>"<i>Ketch</i> me!" said Bealby.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Bealby left Shonts about half-past four in the morning. He
went westward
  because he liked the company of his shadow and was amused at first by its
  vast length. By half-past eight he had covered ten miles, and he was rather
  bored by his shadow. He had eaten nine raw mushrooms, two green apples and a
  quantity of unripe blackberries. None of these things seemed quite at home in
  him. And he had discovered himself to be wearing slippers. They were stout
  carpet slippers, but still they were slippers,&mdash;and the road was telling
  on them. At the ninth mile the left one began to give on the outer seam . He
  got over a stile into a path that ran through the corner of a wood, and there
  he met a smell of frying bacon that turned his very soul to gastric
  juice.</p>

  <p>He stopped short and sniffed the air&mdash;and the air itself was
  sizzling.</p>

  <p>"Oh Krikey," said Bealby, manifestly to the Spirit of the World. "This is
  a bit too strong. I wasn't thinking much before."</p>

  <p>Then he saw something bright yellow and bulky just over the hedge.</p>

  <p>From this it was that the sound of frying came.</p>

  <p>He went to the hedge, making no effort to conceal himself. Outside a great
  yellow caravan with dainty little windows stood a largish dark woman in a
  deerstalker hat, a short brown skirt, a large white apron and spatterdashes
  (among other things) frying bacon and potatoes in a frying-pan. She was very
  red in the face, and the frying-pan was spitting at her as frying-pans do at
  a timid cook....</p>

  <p>Quite mechanically Bealby scrambled through the hedge and drew nearer this
  divine smell. The woman scrutinized him for a moment, and then blinking and
  averting her face went on with her cookery.</p>

  <p>Bealby came quite close to her and remained, noting the bits of potato
  that swam about in the pan, the jolly curling of the rashers, the dancing of
  the bubbles, the hymning splash and splutter of the happy fat....</p>

  <p>(If it should ever fall to my lot to be cooked, may I be fried in potatoes
  and butter. May I be fried with potatoes and good butter made from the milk
  of the cow. God send I am spared boiling; the prison of the pot, the rattling
  lid, the evil darkness, the greasy water....)</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said the lady prodding with her fork at the bacon, "I suppose
  you call yourself a Boy."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss," said Bealby.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever fried?"</p>

  <p>"I could, Miss."</p>

  <p>"Like this?"</p>

  <p>"Better."</p>

  <p>"Just lay hold of this handle&mdash;for it's scorching the skin off my
  face I am." She seemed to think for a moment and added, "entirely."</p>

  <p>In silence Bealby grasped that exquisite smell by the handle, he took the
  fork from her hand and put his hungry eager nose over the seething mess. It
  wasn't only bacon; there were onions, onions giving it&mdash;an edge! It cut
  to the quick of appetite. He could have wept with the intensity of his
  sensations.</p>

  <p>A voice almost as delicious as the smell came out of the caravan window
  behind Bealby' s head.</p>

  <p>"Ju-dy!" cried the voice.</p>

  <p>"Here!&mdash;I mean,&mdash;it's here I am," said the lady in the
  deerstalker.</p>

  <p>"Judy&mdash;you didn't take my stockings for your own by any chance?"</p>

  <p>The lady in the deerstalker gave way to delighted horror. "Sssh,
  Mavourneen!" she cried&mdash;she was one of that large class of amiable women
  who are more Irish than they need be&mdash; "there's a Boy here!"</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 3</h3>

  <p class="first">There was indeed an almost obsequiously industrious and
obliging Boy. An
  hour later he was no longer a Boy but the Boy, and three friendly women were
  regarding him with a merited approval.</p>

  <p>He had done the frying, renewed a waning fire with remarkable skill and
  dispatch, reboiled a neglected kettle in the shortest possible time, laid
  almost without direction a simple meal, very exactly set out campstools and
  cleaned the frying-pan marvellously. Hardly had they taken their portions of
  that appetizing savouriness, than he had whipped off with that implement,
  gone behind the caravan, busied himself there, and returned with the
  pan&mdash;glittering bright. Himself if possible brighter. One cheek indeed
  shone with an animated glow.</p>

  <p>"But wasn't there some of the bacon and stuff left?" asked the lady in the
  deerstalker.</p>

  <p>"I didn't think it was wanted, Miss," said Bealby. "So I cleared it
  up."</p>

  <p>He met understanding in her eye. He questioned her expression.</p>

  <p>"Mayn't I wash up for you. Miss?" he asked to relieve the tension.</p>

  <p>He washed up, swiftly and cleanly. He had never been able to wash up to
  Mr. Mergleson's satisfaction before, but now he did everything Mr. Mergleson
  had ever told him. He asked where to put the things away and he put them
  away. Then he asked politely if there was anything else he could do for them.
  Questioned, he said he liked doing things. "You haven't," said the lady in
  the deerstalker, "a taste for cleaning boots?"</p>

  <p>Bealby declared he had.</p>

  <p>"Surely," said a voice that Bealby adored, "'tis an angel from
  heaven."</p>

  <p>He had a taste for cleaning boots! This was an extraordinary thing for
  Bealby to say. But a great change had come to him in the last half-hour. He
  was violently anxious to do things, any sort of things, servile things, for a
  particular person. He was in love.</p>

  <p>The owner of the beautiful voice had come out of the caravan, she had
  stood for a moment in the doorway before descending the steps to the ground
  and the soul of Bealby had bowed down before her in instant submission. Never
  had he seen anything so lovely. Her straight slender body was sheathed in
  blue; fair hair a little tinged with red poured gloriously back from her
  broad forehead, and she had the sweetest eyes in the world. One hand lifted
  her dress from her feet; the other rested on the lintel of the caravan door.
  She looked at him and smiled.</p>

  <p>So for two years she had looked and smiled across the footlights to the
  Bealby in mankind. She had smiled now on her entrance out of habit. She took
  the effect upon Bealby as a foregone conclusion.</p>

  <p>Then she had looked to make sure that everything was ready before she
  descended.</p>

  <p>"How good it smells, Judy!" she had said.</p>

  <p>"I've had a helper," said the woman who wore spats.</p>

  <p>That time the blue-eyed lady had smiled at him quite definitely....</p>

  <p>The third member of the party had appeared unobserved; the irradiations of
  the beautiful lady had obscured her. Bealby discovered her about. She was
  bareheaded; she wore a simple grey dress with a Norfolk jacket, and she had a
  pretty, clear white profile under black hair. She answered to the name of
  "Winnie." The beautiful lady was Madeleine. They made little obscure jokes
  with each other and praised the morning ardently. "This is the best place of
  all," said Madeleine.</p>

  <p>"All night," said Winnie, "not a single mosquito."</p>

  <p>None of these three ladies made any attempt to conceal the sincerity of
  their hunger or their appreciation of Bealby's assistance. How good a thing
  is appreciation! Here he was doing with joy and pride and an eager
  excellence, the very services he had done so badly under the cuffings of
  Mergleson and Thomas....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 4</h3>

  <p class="first">And now Bealby, having been regarded with approval for some
moments and
  discussed in tantalizing undertones, was called upon to explain himself.</p>

  <p>"Boy," said the lady in the deerstalker, who was evidently the leader and
  still more evidently the spokeswoman of the party, "come here."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss." He put down the boot he was cleaning on the caravan step.</p>

  <p>"In the first place, know by these presents, I am a married woman."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss."</p>

  <p>"And Miss is not a seemly mode of address for me."</p>

  <p>"No, Miss. I mean&mdash;" Bealby hung for a moment and by the happiest of
  accidents, a scrap of his instruction at Shonts came up in his mind. "No," he
  said, "your&mdash;ladyship."</p>

  <p>A great light shone on the spokeswoman's face. "Not yet, my child," she
  said, "not yet. He hasn't done his duty by me. I am&mdash; a simple Mum."</p>

  <p>Bealby was intelligently silent.</p>

  <p>"Say&mdash;Yes, Mum."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mum," said Bealby, and everybody laughed very agreeably.</p>

  <p>"And now," said the lady, taking pleasure</p>

  <p>in her words, "know by these presents</p>

  <p>By the bye, what is your name?"</p>

  <p>Bealby scarcely hesitated. "Dick Maltravers. Mum," he said and almost
  added, "The Dauntless Daredevil of the Diamondfields Horse," which was the
  second title.</p>

  <p>"Dick will do," said the lady who was called Judy, and added suddenly and
  very amusingly: "You may keep the rest."</p>

  <p>(These were the sort of people Bealby liked. The right sort.)</p>

  <p>"Well, Dick, we want to know, have you ever been in service?"</p>

  <p>It was sudden. But Bealby was equal to it. "Only for a day or two.
  Miss&mdash;I mean, Mum,&mdash;just to be useful."</p>

  <p>"Were you useful?"</p>

  <p>Bealby tried to think whether he had been, and could recall nothing but
  the face of Thomas with the fork hanging from it. "I did my best, Mum," he
  said impartially.</p>

  <p>"And all that is over?" Yes, Mum."</p>

  <p>And you're at home again and out of employment?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mum."</p>

  <p>"Do you live near here?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;leastways, not very far."</p>

  <p>"With your father?"</p>

  <p>"Stepfather, Mum. I'm a Norfan."</p>

  <p>"Well, how would you like to come with us for a few days and help with
  things? Seven-and-sixpence a week,"</p>

  <p>Bealby's face was eloquent.</p>

  <p>"Would your stepfather object?"</p>

  <p>Bealby considered. "I don't think he would," he said.</p>

  <p>"You'd better go round and ask him."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;suppose&mdash;yes," he said.</p>

  <p>"And get a few things."</p>

  <p>"Things, Mum?"</p>

  <p>"Collars and things. You needn't bring a great box for such a little
  while."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mum...."</p>

  <p>He hovered rather undecidedly.</p>

  <p>"Better run along now. Our man and horse will be coming presently. We
  shan't be able to wait for you long...."</p>

  <p>Bealby assumed a sudden briskness and departed.</p>

  <p>At the gate of the field he hesitated almost imperceptibly and then
  directed his face to the Sabbath stillness of the village.</p>

  <p>Perplexity corrugated his features. The stepfather's permission presented
  no difficulties, but it was more difficult about the luggage.</p>

  <p>A voice called after him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mum?" he said attentive and hopeful.
  Perhaps&mdash;somehow&mdash;they wouldn't want luggage.</p>

  <p>"You'll want boots. You'll have to walk by the caravan, you know. You'll
  want some good stout boots."</p>

  <p>"All right, Mum," he said with a sorrowful break in his voice. He waited a
  few moments but nothing more came. He went on&mdash;very slowly. He had
  forgotten about the boots.</p>

  <p>That defeated him....</p>

  <p>It is hard to be refused admission to Paradise for the want of a hand-bag
  and a pair of walking boots....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 5</h3>

  <p class="first">Bealby was by no means certain that he was going back to
that caravan. He
  wanted to do so quite painfully, but</p>

  <p>He'd just look a fool going back without boots and&mdash;nothing on earth
  would reconcile him to the idea of looking a fool in the eyes of that
  beautiful woman in blue.</p>

  <p>"Dick," he whispered to himself despondently, "Daredevil Dick!" (A more
  miserable-looking face you never set eyes on.) "It's all up with your little
  schemes, Dick my boy. You must get a bag&mdash;and nothing on earth will get
  you a bag."</p>

  <p>He paid little heed to the village through which he wandered. He knew
  there were no bags there. Chance rather than any volition of his own guided
  him down a side path that led to the nearly dry bed of a little rivulet, and
  there he sat down on some weedy grass under a group of willows. It was an
  untidy place that needed all the sunshine of the morning to be tolerable; one
  of those places where stinging nettles take heart and people throw old
  kettles, broken gallipots, jaded gravel, grass cuttings, rusty rubbish, old
  boots</p>

  <p>For a time Bealby's eyes rested on the objects with an entire lack of
  interest.</p>

  <p>Then he was reminded of his not so very remote childhood when he had found
  an old boot and made it into a castle....</p>

  <p>Presently he got up and walked across to the rubbish heap and surveyed its
  treasures with a quickened intelligence. He picked up a widowed boot and
  weighed it in his hand.</p>

  <p>He dropped it abruptly, turned about and hurried back into the village
  street.</p>

  <p>He had ideas, two ideas, one for the luggage and one for the boots.... If
  only he could manage it. Hope beat his great pinions in the heart of
  Bealby.</p>

  <p>Sunday! The shops were shut. Yes, that was a fresh obstacle. He'd
  forgotten that.</p>

  <p>The public-house stood bashfully open, the shy uninviting openness of
  Sunday morning before closing time, but public-houses alas! at all hours are
  forbidden to little boys. And besides he wasn't likely to get what he wanted
  in a public-house; he wanted a shop, a general shop. And here before him was
  the general shop&mdash;and its door ajar! His desire carried him over the
  threshold. The Sabbatical shutters made the place dark and cool, and the
  smell of bacon and cheese and chandleries, the very spirit of grocery, calm
  and unhurried, was cool and Sabbatical too, as if it sat there for the day in
  its best clothes. And a pleasant woman was talking over the counter to a thin
  and worried one who carried a bundle.</p>

  <p>Their intercourse had a flavour of emergency and they both stopped
  abruptly at the appearance of Bealby.</p>

  <p>His desire, his craving was now so great that it had altogether subdued
  the natural wiriness of his appearance. He looked meek, he looked good, he
  was swimming in propitiation and tender with respect. He produced an effect
  of being much smaller. He had got nice eyes. His movements were refined and
  his manners perfect.</p>

  <p>"Not doing business to-day, my boy," said the pleasant woman.</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>please</i> 'm," he said from his heart.</p>

  <p>"Sunday, you know."</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>please</i> 'm. If you could just give me a nold sheet of paper 'm,
  please."</p>

  <p>"What for?" asked the pleasant woman.</p>

  <p>"Just to wrap something up 'm."</p>

  <p>She reflected and natural goodness had its way with her.</p>

  <p>"A nice <i>big</i> bit?" said the woman.</p>

  <p>"Please 'm."</p>

  <p>"Would you like it brown?"</p>

  <p>"0h, <i>please</i> 'm."</p>

  <p>"And you got some string?"</p>

  <p>Only cottony stuff," said Bealby, disembowelling a trouser pocket. "Wiv
  knots. But I dessay I can manage."</p>

  <p>"You'd better have a bit of good string with it, my dear," said the
  pleasant woman, whose generosity was now fairly on the run, "Then you can do
  your parcel up nice and tidy....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 6</h3>

  <p class="first">The white horse was already in the shafts of the caravan
and William, a
  deaf and clumsy man of uncertain age and a vast sharp noseiness, was lifting
  in the basket of breakfast gear and grumbling in undertones at the wickedness
  and unfairness of travelling on Sunday, when Bealby returned to gladden three
  waiting women.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said the inconspicuous lady, "I knew he'd come."</p>

  <p>"Look at his poor little precious parsivel," said the actress.</p>

  <p>Regarded as luggage it was rather pitiful, a knobby, brown paper parcel
  about the size&mdash; to be perfectly frank&mdash;of a tin can, two old boots
  and some grass, very carefully folded and tied up,&mdash;and carried
  gingerly.</p>

  <p>"But " the lady in the deerstalker began</p>

  <p>and then paused.</p>

  <p>"Dick," she said, as he came nearer, "Where's your boots?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, please. Mum," said the dauntless one, "they was away being mended. My
  stepfather thought perhaps you wouldn't mind if I didn't have boots. He said
  perhaps I might be able to get some more boots out of my salary...."</p>

  <p>The lady in the deerstalker looked alarmingly uncertain and Bealby
  controlled infinite distresses.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you got a mother, Dick?" asked the beautiful voice suddenly. Its
  owner abounded in such spasmodic curiosities.</p>

  <p>"She&mdash;last year ..." Matricide is a painful business at any time. And
  just as you see, in spite of every effort you have made, the jolliest lark in
  the world slipping out of your reach. And the sweet voice so sorry for him!
  So sorry! Bealby suddenly veiled his face with his elbow and gave way to
  honourable tears....</p>

  <p>A simultaneous desire to make him happy, help him to forget his loss,
  possessed three women....</p>

  <p>"That'll be all right, Dick," said the lady in the deerstalker patting his
  shoulder. "We'll get you some boots to-morrow. And to-day you must sit up
  beside William and spare your feet. You'll have to go to the inns with
  him...."</p>

  <p>"It's wonderful, the elasticity of youth," said the inconspicuous lady
  five minutes later. "To see that boy now, you'd never imagine he'd had a
  sorrow in the world."</p>

  <p>"Now get up there," said the lady who was the leader. "We shall walk
  across the fields and join you later. You understand where you are to wait
  for us, William?"</p>

  <p>She came nearer and shouted, "You understand, William?"</p>

  <p>William nodded ambiguously. "'Ent a Vool," he said.</p>

  <p>The ladies departed. "You'll be all right, Dick," cried the actress
  kindly.</p>

  <p>He sat up where he had been put, trying to look as Orphan Dick as possible
  after all that had occurred.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 7</h3>

  <p class="first">"Do you know the wind on the heath&mdash;have you lived the
Gypsy life?
  Have you spoken, wanderers yourselves, with a 'Romany chi and Romany chal' on
  the wind-swept moors at home or abroad? Have you tramped the broad highways,
  and, at close of day, pitched your tent near a running stream and cooked your
  supper by starlight over a fire of pinewood? Do you know the dreamless sleep
  of the wanderer at peace with himself and all the world?"</p>

  <p>For most of us the answer to these questions of the Amateur Camping Club
  is in the negative.</p>

  <p>Yet every year the call of the road, the Borrovian glamour, draws away a
  certain small number of the imaginative from the grosser comforts of a
  complex civilization, takes them out into tents and caravans and intimate
  communion with Nature and, incidentally, with various ingenious appliances
  designed to meet the needs of cooking in a breeze. It is an adventure to
  which high spirits and great expectations must be brought, it is an
  experience in proximity which few friendships survive&mdash;and altogether
  very great fun.</p>

  <p>The life of breezy freedom resolves itself in practice chiefly into
  washing up and an anxious search for permission to camp. One learns how rich
  and fruitful our world can be in bystanders, and how easy it is to forget
  essential groceries....</p>

  <p>The heart of the joy of it lies in its perfect detachment. There you are
  in the morning sunlight under the trees that overhang the road going whither
  you will. Everything you need you have. Your van creaks along at your side.
  You are outside inns, outside houses, a home, a community, an imperium in
  imperio. At any moment you may draw out of the traffic upon the wayside grass
  and say, "Here&mdash; until the owner catches us at it&mdash;is home!" At any
  time&mdash;subject to the complaisance of William and your being able to find
  him&mdash; you may inspan and go onward. The world is all before you. You
  taste the complete yet leisurely insouciance of the snail.</p>

  <p>And two of those three ladies had other satisfactions to supplement their
  pleasures. They both adored Madeleine Philips. She was not only perfectly
  sweet and lovely but she was known to be so; she had that most potent charm
  for women, prestige. They had got her all to themselves. They could show now
  how false is the old idea that there is no friendship nor conversation among
  women. They were full of wit and pretty things for one another and snatches
  of song in between. And they were free too from their "menfolk." They were
  doing without them. Dr. Bowles, the husband of the lady in the deerstalker,
  was away in Ireland, and Mr. Geedge, the lord of the inconspicuous woman, was
  golfing at Sandwich. And Madeleine Philips, it was understood, was only too
  glad to shake herself free from the crowd of admirers that hovered about her
  like wasps about honey....</p>

  <p>Yet after three days each one had thoughts about the need of helpfulness
  and more particularly about washing-up, that were better left unspoken, that
  were indeed conspicuously unspoken beneath their merry give and take, like a
  black and silent river flowing beneath a bridge of ivory. And each of them
  had a curious feeling in the midst of all this fresh free behaviour, as
  though the others were not listening sufficiently, as though something of the
  effect of them was being wasted. Madeleine's smiles became rarer; at times
  she was almost impassive, and Judy preserved nearly all her wit and verbal
  fireworks for the times when they passed through villages.... Mrs. Geedge was
  less visibly affected. She had thoughts of writing a book about it all,
  telling in the gayest, most provocative way, full of the quietest quaintest
  humour, just how jolly they had been. Menfolk would read it. This kept a
  little thin smile upon her lips....</p>

  <p>As an audience William was tough stuff. He pretended deafness; he never
  looked. He did not want to look. He seemed always to be holding his nose in
  front of his face to prevent his observation&mdash;as men pray into their
  hats at church. But once Judy Bowles overheard a phrase or so in his private
  soliloquy. "Pack o' wimmin," William was saying. "Dratted petticoats. Dang
  'em. That's what I say to 'um. Dang 'em!"</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, he just fell short of saying it to them. But his
  manner said it....</p>

  <p>You begin to see how acceptable an addition was young Bealby to this
  company. He was not only helpful, immensely helpful, in things material, a
  vigorous and at first a careful washer-up, an energetic boot-polisher, a most
  serviceable cleaner and tidier of things, but he was also belief and support.
  Undisguisedly he thought the caravan the loveliest thing going, and its three
  mistresses the most wonderful of people. His alert eyes followed them about
  full of an unstinted admiration and interest, he pricked his ears when Judy
  opened her mouth, he handed things to Mrs. Geedge. He made no secret about
  Madeleine. When she spoke to him, he lost his breath, he reddened and was
  embarrassed....</p>

  <p>They went across the fields saying that he was the luckiest of finds. It
  was fortunate his people had been so ready to spare him. Judy said boys were
  a race very cruelly maligned; see how willing he was! Mrs. Geedge said there
  was something elfin about Bealby's little face; Madeleine smiled at the
  thought of his quaint artlessness. She knew quite clearly that he'd die for
  her....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 8</h3>

  <p class="first">There was a little pause as the ladies moved away.</p>

  <p>Then William spat and spoke in a note of irrational bitterness.</p>

  <p>"Brasted Voolery," said William and then loudly and fiercely, "Cam up y'
  ode Runt you."</p>

  <p>At these words the white horse started into a convulsive irregular
  redistribution of its feet, the caravan strained and quivered into motion and
  Bealby's wanderings as a caravanner began.</p>

  <p>For a time William spoke no more and Bealby scarcely regarded him. The
  light of strange fortunes and deep enthusiasm was in Bealby's eyes....</p>

  <p>"One Thing," said William, "they don't 'ave the Sense to lock anythink
  up&mdash;Whatever."</p>

  <p>Bealby's attention was recalled to the existence of his companion.</p>

  <p>William's face was one of those faces that give one at first the
  impression of a solitary and very conceited nose. The other features are
  entirely subordinated to that salient effect. One sees them later. His eyes
  were small and uneven, his mouth apparently toothless, thin-lipped and
  crumpled, with the upper lip falling over the other in a manner suggestive of
  a meagre firmness mixed with appetite. When he spoke he made a faint
  slobbering sound. "Everyfink," he said, "behind there."</p>

  <p>He became confidential. "I been in there. I larked about wiv their
  Fings."</p>

  <p>"They got some choc'late," he said, lusciously. "Oo Fine!"</p>

  <p>"All sorts of Fings."</p>

  <p>He did not seem to expect any reply from Bealby.</p>

  <p>"We going far before we meet 'em?" asked Bealby.</p>

  <p>William's deafness became apparent.</p>

  <p>His mind was preoccupied by other ideas.</p>

  <p>One wicked eye came close to Bealby's face. "We going to 'ave a bit of
  choc'late," he said in a wet desirous voice.</p>

  <p>He pointed his thumb over his shoulder at the door. "You get it," said
  William with reassuring nods and the mouth much pursed and very oblique.</p>

  <p>Bealby shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It's in a little dror, under 'er place where she sleeps."</p>

  <p>Bealby's head-shake became more emphatic.</p>

  <p>"Yus, I tell you," said William.</p>

  <p>"No," said Bealby.</p>

  <p>"Choc'late I tell you," said William and ran the tongue of appetite round
  the rim of his toothless mouth.</p>

  <p>"Don't want choc'late," said Bealby, thinking of a large lump of it.</p>

  <p>"Go on," said William. "Nobody won't see you...."</p>

  <p>"Go it!" said William....</p>

  <p>"You're afraid," said William....</p>

  <p>"Here, I'll go," said William, losing self-control. "You just 'old these
  reins."</p>

  <p>Bealby took the reins. William got up and opened the door of the caravan.
  Then Bealby realized his moral responsibility&mdash;and, leaving the reins,
  clutched William firmly by his baggy nether garments. They were elderly
  garments, much sat upon. "Don't be a Vool," said William, struggling. "Leago
  my slack."</p>

  <p>Something partially gave way and William's head came round to deal with
  Bealby.</p>

  <p>"What you mean pullin' my cloes orf me?"</p>

  <p>"That,"&mdash;he investigated. "Take me a Nour to sew up."</p>

  <p>"I ain't going to steal," shouted Bealby into the ear of William.</p>

  <p>Nobody arst you to steal "</p>

  <p>Nor you neither," said Bealby.</p>

  <p>The caravan bumped heavily against a low garden wall, skidded a little and
  came to rest. William sat down suddenly. The white horse after a period of
  confusion with its legs, tried the flavour of some overhanging lilac branches
  and was content.</p>

  <p>"Gimme those reins," said William. "You be the Brastedest Young
  Vool...."</p>

  <p>"Sittin' 'ere," said William presently, "chewin' our teeth, when we might
  be eatin' choc'late...."</p>

  <p>"I 'ent got no use for you," said William, "blowed if I 'ave...."</p>

  <p>Then the thought of his injuries returned</p>

  <p>to him.</p>

  <p>"I'd make you sew 'em up yourself, darned if I woun't&mdash;on'y you'd go
  running the brasted needle into me.... Nour's work there is&mdash; by the
  feel of it.... Mor'n nour.... Gooddbe done, too.... All I got...."</p>

  <p>"I'll give you Sumpfin you little Beace 'fore I done wi' you."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't steal 'er choc'lates," said young Bealby, "Not if I was
  starving."</p>

  <p>"Eh?" shouted William.</p>

  <p>"Steal!" shouted Bealby.</p>

  <p>"I'll steal ye, 'fore I done with ye," said William. "Tearin' my cloes for
  me.... Oh! Cam up y'old Runt. We don't want you to stop and lissen. Cam up I
  tell you!"</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 9</h3>

  <p class="first">They found the ladies rather, it seemed, by accident than
design, waiting
  upon a sandy common rich with purple heather and bordered by woods of fir and
  spruce. They had been waiting some time and it was clear that the sight of
  the yellow caravan relieved an accumulated anxiety. Bealby rejoiced to see
  them. His soul glowed with the pride of chocolate resisted and William
  overcome. He resolved to distinguish himself over the preparation of the
  midday meal. It was a pleasant little island of green they chose for their
  midday pitch, a little patch of emerald turf amidst the purple, a patch
  already doomed to removal, as a bare oblong and a pile of rolled-up turves
  witnessed.</p>

  <p>This pile and a little bank of heather and bramble promised shelter from
  the breeze, and down the hill a hundred yards away was a spring and a
  built-up pool. This spot lay perhaps fifty yards away from the high road and
  one reached it along a rutty track which had been made by the turf cutters.
  And overhead was the glorious sky of an English summer, with great clouds
  like sunlit, white-sailed ships, the Constable sky. The white horse was
  hobbled and turned out to pasture among the heather, and William was sent off
  to get congenial provender at the nearest public-house. "William!" shouted
  Mrs, Bowles as he departed, shouting confidentially into his ear, "Get your
  clothes mended!"</p>

  <p>"Eh?" said William.</p>

  <p>"Mend your clothes."</p>

  <p>"Yah! 'E did that," said William viciously with a movement of self-
  protection and so went.</p>

  <p>Nobody watched him go. Almost sternly they set to work upon the luncheon
  preparation as William receded. "William," Mrs. Bowles remarked, as she
  bustled with the patent cooker, putting it up wrong way round so that
  afterwards it collapsed, "William&mdash;takes offence. Sometimes I think he
  takes offence almost too often.... Did you have any difficulty with him,
  Dick?"</p>

  <p>"It wasn't anything, Miss," said Bealby meekly.</p>

  <p>Bealby was wonderful with the firelighting, and except that he cracked a
  plate in warming it, quite admirable as a cook. He burnt his fingers
  twice&mdash;and liked doing it; he ate his portion with instinctive modesty
  on the other side of the caravan, and he washed up as Mr. Mergleson had
  always instructed him to do. Mrs. Bowles showed him how to clean knives and
  forks by sticking them into the turf. A little to his surprise these ladies
  lit and smoked cigarettes. They sat about and talked perplexingly. Clever
  staff. Then he had to get water from the neighbouring brook and boil the
  kettle for an early tea. Madeleine produced a charmingly bound little book
  and read in it, the other two professed themselves anxious for the view from
  a neighbouring hill. They produced their sensible spiked Swiss walking-sticks
  such as one does not see in England; they seemed full of energy. "You go,"
  Madeleine had said, "while I and Dick stay here and make tea. I've walked
  enough to-day...."</p>

  <p>So Bealby, happy to the pitch of ecstasy, first explored the wonderful
  interior of the caravan, there was a dresser, a stove, let-down chairs and
  tables and all manner of things, and then nursed the kettle to the singing
  stage on the patent cooker while the beautiful lady reclined close at hand on
  a rug.</p>

  <p>"Dick!" she said.</p>

  <p>He had forgotten he was Dick.</p>

  <p>"Dick!"</p>

  <p>He remembered his personality with a start. "Yes, Miss!" He knelt up, with
  a handful of twigs in his hand and regarded her.</p>

  <p>"Well, Dick," she said.</p>

  <p>He remained flushed adoration. There was a little pause and the lady
  smiled at him an unaffected smile.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to be, Dick, when you grow up?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Miss. I've wondered."</p>

  <p>"What would you like to be?"</p>

  <p>"Something abroad. Something&mdash;so that you could see things."</p>

  <p>"A soldier?"</p>

  <p>"Or a sailor. Miss."</p>

  <p>"A sailor sees nothing but the sea."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather be a sailor than a common soldier. Miss."</p>

  <p>"You'd like to be an officer?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss&mdash;only "</p>

  <p>"One of my very best friends is an officer," she said, a little
  irrelevantly it seemed to Bealby.</p>

  <p>"I'd be a Norficer like a shot," said Bealby, "if I 'ad 'arf a chance,
  Miss."</p>

  <p>"Officers nowadays," she said, "have to be very brave, able men."</p>

  <p>"I know, Miss," said Bealby modestly.</p>

  <p>The fire required attention for a little while....</p>

  <p>The lady turned over on her elbow. "What do you think you are likely to
  be, Dick?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He didn't know.</p>

  <p>"What sort of man is your stepfather?"</p>

  <p>Bealby looked at her. "He isn't much," he said.</p>

  <p>"What is he?"</p>

  <p>Bealby hadn't the slightest intention of being the son of a gardener.
  "'E's a law-writer."</p>

  <p>"What! in that village."</p>

  <p>"'E 'as to stay there for 'is 'ealth. Miss," he said. "Every summer. 'Is
  'ealth is very pre-precocious, Miss...."</p>

  <p>He fed his fire with a few judiciously administered twigs.</p>

  <p>"What was your own father, Dick?"</p>

  <p>With that she opened a secret door in Bealby's imagination. All
  stepchildren have those dreams. With him they were so frequent and vivid that
  they had long since become a kind of second truth. He coloured a little and
  answered with scarcely an interval for reflection. "'E passed as
  Mal-travers," he said.</p>

  <p>"Wasn't that his name?"</p>

  <p>"I don't rightly know, Miss. There was always something kep' from me. My
  mother used to say, 'Artie,' she used to say: 'there's things that some day
  you must know, things that concern you. Things about your farver. But poor as
  we are now and struggling.... Not yet.... Some day you shall know
  truly&mdash; who you are!' That was 'ow she said it, Miss."</p>

  <p>"And she died before she told you?"</p>

  <p>He had almost forgotten that he had killed his mother that very morning.
  "Yes, miss," he said.</p>

  <p>She smiled at him and something in her smile made him blush hotly. For a
  moment he could have believed she understood. And indeed she did understand
  and it amused her to find this boy doing what she herself had done at times,
  what indeed she felt it was still in her to do. She felt that most delicate
  of sympathies, the sympathy of one rather over-imaginative person for
  another. But her next question dispelled his doubt of her though it left him
  red and hot. She asked it with a convincing simplicity.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea, Dick, have you any guess or suspicion, I mean, who it
  is you really are?"</p>

  <p>"I wish I had. Miss," he said. "I suppose it doesn't matter,
  really&mdash;but one can't help wondering...."</p>

  <p>How often he had wondered in his lonely wanderings through that dear city
  of day-dreams where all the people one knows look out of windows as one
  passes and the roads are paved with pride! How often had he decided and
  changed and decided again!</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 10</h3>

  <p class="first">Now suddenly a realization of intrusion shattered this
conversation. A
  third person stood over the little encampment, smiling mysteriously and
  waving a cleek in a slow hieratic manner through the air.</p>

  <p>"Delicious lill' corn'," said the newcomer in tones of benediction.</p>

  <p>He met their inquiring eyes with a luxurious smile, "'Licious," he said,
  and remained swaying insecurely and failing to express some imperfectly
  apprehended deep meaning by short peculiar movements of the cleek.</p>

  <p>He was obviously a golfer astray from some adjacent course&mdash;and he
  had lunched.</p>

  <p>"Mighty Join-you," he said, and then very distinctly in a full large
  voice, "Miss Malleleine Philps." There are the penalties of a public and
  popular life.</p>

  <p>"He's <i>drunk</i>," the lady whispered. "Get him to go away, Dick. I
  can't endure drunken men."</p>

  <p>She stood up and Bealby stood up. He advanced in front of her, slowly,
  with his nose in the air, extraordinarily like a small terrier smelling at a
  strange dog.</p>

  <p>"I said Mighty Join-you," the golfer repeated. His voice was richly
  excessive. He was a big heavy man with a short-cropped moustache, a great
  deal of neck and dewlap and a solemn expression.</p>

  <p>"Prup. Be'r. Introzuze m'self," he remarked. He tried to indicate himself
  by waving his hand towards himself but finally abandoned the attempt as
  impossible. "Ma' Goo' Soch'l Poshishun," he said.</p>

  <p>Bealby had a disconcerting sense of retreating footsteps behind him. He
  glanced over his shoulder and saw Miss Philips standing at the foot of the
  steps that led up to the fastnesses of the caravan. "Dick," she cried with a
  sharp note of alarm in her voice, "get rid of that man."</p>

  <p>A moment after Bealby heard the door shut and a sound of a key in its
  lock. He concealed his true feelings by putting his arms akimbo, sticking his
  legs wider apart and contemplating the task before him with his head a little
  on one side. He was upheld by the thought that the yellow caravan had a
  window looking upon him....</p>

  <p>The newcomer seemed to consider the ceremony of introduction completed. "I
  done care for goff," he said, almost vaingloriously.</p>

  <p>He waved his cleek to express his preference. "Natua," he said with a
  satisfaction that bordered on fatuity.</p>

  <p>He prepared to come down from the little turfy crest on which he stood to
  the encampment.</p>

  <p>"'Ere!" said Bealby. "This is Private."</p>

  <p>The golfer indicated by solemn movements of the cleek that this was
  understood but that other considerations overrode it.</p>

  <p>"You You got to go!" cried Bealby</p>

  <p>in a breathless squeak. "You get out of here."</p>

  <p>The golfer waved an arm as who should say, "You do not understand but I
  forgive you," and continued to advance towards the fire. And then Bealby, at
  the end of his tact, commenced hostilities.</p>

  <p>He did so because he felt he had to do something and he did not know what
  else to do.</p>

  <p>"Wan' no thin' but frenly conversation sushus custm'ry webred peel," the
  golfer was saying, and then a large fragment of turf hit him in the neck,
  burst all about him and stopped him abruptly.</p>

  <p>He remained for some lengthy moments too astonished for words. He was not
  only greatly surprised but he chose to appear even more surprised than he
  was. In spite of the brown-black mould upon his cheek and brow and a slight
  displacement of his cap, he achieved a sort of dignity. He came slowly to a
  focus upon Bealby, who stood by the turf pile grasping a second missile. The
  cleek was extended sceptre wise.</p>

  <p>"Replace the&mdash;Divot."</p>

  <p>"You go orf," said Bealby. "I'll chuck it if you don't. I tell you
  fair."</p>

  <p>"Replace the&mdash;Divot," roared the golfer again in a voice of
  extraordinary power. You&mdash;you go!" said Bealby. Am I t'ask you. Third
  time. Reshpect&mdash; Roos.... Replace the Divot."</p>

  <p>It struck him fully in the face.</p>

  <p>He seemed to emerge through the mould. He was blinking but still
  dignified. "Tha'&mdash; was intentional," he said.</p>

  <p>He seemed to gather himself together....</p>

  <p>Then suddenly and with a surprising nimbleness he discharged himself at
  Bealby. He came with astonishing swiftness. He got within a foot of him. Well
  it was for Bealby that he had learnt to dodge in the village playground. He
  went down under the golfer's arm and away round the end of the stack, and the
  golfer with his force spent in concussion remained for a time clinging to the
  turf pile and apparently trying to remember how he got there. Then he was
  reminded of recent occurrences by a shrill small voice from the other side of
  the stack.</p>

  <p>"You gow away!" said the voice. "Can't you see you're annoying a lady? You
  gow away."</p>

  <p>"No wish&mdash;'noy anyone. Pease wall wirl."</p>

  <p>But this was&mdash;subterfuge. He meant to catch that boy.</p>

  <p>Suddenly and rather brilliantly he turned the flank of the turf pile, and
  only a couple of loose turfs at the foot of the heap upset his calculations.
  He found himself on all fours on ground from which it was difficult to rise.
  But he did not lose heart. "Boy&mdash;hic&mdash; scow," he said, and became
  for a second rush a nimble quadruped.</p>

  <p>Again he got quite astonishingly near to Bealby, and then in an instant
  was on his feet and running across the encampment after him. He succeeded in
  kicking over the kettle and the patent cooker without any injury to himself
  or loss of pace, and succumbed only to the sharp turn behind the end of the
  caravan and the steps. He hadn't somehow thought of the steps. So he went
  down rather heavily. But now the spirit of a fine man was roused. Regardless
  of the scream from inside that had followed his collapse, he was up and in
  pursuit almost instantly. Bealby only escaped the swiftness of his rush by
  jumping the shafts and going away across the front of the caravan to the turf
  pile again. The golfer tried to jump the shafts too, but he was not equal to
  that. He did in a manner jump. But it was almost as much diving as jumping.
  And there was something in it almost like the curveting of a Great
  Horse....</p>

  <p>When Bealby turned at the crash, the golfer was already on all fours again
  and trying very busily to crawl out between the shaft and the front wheel. He
  would have been more successful in doing this if he had not begun by putting
  his arm through the wheel. As it was he was trying to do too much; he was
  trying to crawl out at two points at once and getting very rapidly annoyed at
  his inability to do so. The caravan was shifting slowly forward....</p>

  <p>It was manifest to Bealby that getting this man to go was likely to be a
  much more lengthy business than he had supposed.</p>

  <p>He surveyed the situation for a moment and then realizing the entanglement
  of his opponent, he seized a camp-stool by one leg, went round by the steps
  and attacked the prostrate enemy from the rear with effectual but
  inconclusive fury.</p>

  <p>He hammered....</p>

  <p>"Steady on, young man," said a voice and he was seized from behind. He
  turned&mdash;to discover himself in the grip of a second golfer....</p>

  <p>Another! Bealby fought in a fury of fear....</p>

  <p>He bit an arm&mdash;rather too tweedy to feel much&mdash;and got in a
  couple of shinners&mdash;alas! that they were only slippered
  shinners!&mdash;before he was overpowered....</p>

  <p>A cuffed, crumpled, disarmed and panting Bealby found himself watching the
  careful extraction of the first golfer from the front wheel. Two friends
  assisted that gentleman with a reproachful gentleness, and his repeated
  statements that he was all right seemed to reassure them greatly. Altogether
  there were now four golfers in the field, counting the pioneer.</p>

  <p>"He was after this devil of a boy," said the one who held Bealby.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but how did he get here?" asked a second friend.</p>

  <p>"Feel better now?" said the third, helping the first comer to his
  uncertain feet. "Let me have your cleek o' man.... You won't want your
  cleek...."</p>

  <p>Across the heather, lifting their heads a little, came Mrs. Bowles and
  Mrs. Geedge returning from their walk. They were wondering whoever their
  visitors could be.</p>

  <p>And then like music after a dispute came Madeleine Philips, a beautiful
  blue-robed thing, coming slowly with a kind of wonder on her face, out of the
  caravan and down the steps. Instinctively everybody turned to her. The
  drunkard with a gesture released himself from his supporter and stood erect.
  His cap was replaced upon him&mdash;obliquely. His cleek had been
  secured.</p>

  <p>"I heard a noise," said Madeleine lifting her pretty chin and speaking in
  her sweetest tones.</p>

  <p>She looked her inquiries....</p>

  <p>She surveyed the three sober men with a practised eye. She chose the
  tallest, a fair, serious-looking young man standing conveniently at the
  drunkard's elbow.</p>

  <p>"Will you please take your friend away?" she said, indicating the offender
  with her beautiful white hand.</p>

  <p>"Simly," he said in a slightly subdued voice. "Simly coring."</p>

  <p>Everybody tried for a moment to understand him.</p>

  <p>"Look here, old man, you've got no business here," said the fair young
  man. "You'd better come back to the club-house."</p>

  <p>The drunken man stuck to his statement. "Simly coring," he said a little
  louder.</p>

  <p>"I think," said a little bright-eyed man with a very cheerful yellow vest,
  "I think he's apologizing. I hope so."</p>

  <p>The drunken man nodded his head. That among other matters.</p>

  <p>The tall young man took his arm but he insisted on his point. "Simly
  coring," he said with emphasis. "If&mdash;if&mdash;donewan' me to cor.
  Notome. Nottot.... Mean' say. Nottot tat-tome. Nottotome. Orny
  way&mdash;sayin' notome. No wish 'trude. No wish 'all."</p>

  <p>"Well then, you see, you'd better come away."</p>

  <p>"I ars' you&mdash;are you tome? Miss&mdash;Miss Pips." He appealed to Miss
  Philips.</p>

  <p>"If you'd answer him " said the tall young man.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," she said with great dignity and the pretty chin higher than
  ever. "I am not at home."</p>

  <p>"Nuthin' more t'say then," said the drunken man, and with a sudden
  stoicism he turned away.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, submitting to support.</p>

  <p>"Simly orny arfnoon cor," he said generally and permitted himself to be
  led off.</p>

  <p>"Orny frenly cor...."</p>

  <p>For some time he was audible as he receded explaining in a rather
  condescending voice, the extreme social correctness of his behaviour. Just
  for a moment or so there was a slight tussle, due to his desire to return and
  leave cards....</p>

  <p>He was afterwards seen to be distributing a small handful of visiting
  cards amidst the heather with his free arm, rather in the manner of a paper
  chase&mdash;but much more gracefully.... Then decently and in order he was
  taken out of sight....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 11</h3>

  <p class="first">Bealby had been unostentatiously released by his captor as
soon as Miss
  Philips appeared, and the two remaining golfers now addressed themselves to
  the three ladies in regret and explanation.</p>

  <p>The man who had held Bealby was an aquiline grey-clad person with a
  cascade moustache and wrinkled eyes and for some obscure reason he seemed to
  be amused; the little man in the yellow vest however was quite earnest and
  serious enough to make up for him. He was one of those little fresh-coloured
  men whose faces stick forward openly. He had open projecting eyes, an open
  mouth, his cheeks were frank to the pitch of ostentation, his cap was thrust
  back from his exceptionally open forehead. He had a chest and a stomach.
  These, too, he held out. He would have held out anything. His legs leant
  forward from the feet. It was evidently impossible for a man of his nature to
  be anything but clean shaved.... Our fault entirely," he said. "Ought to have
  looked after him. Can't say how sorry and ashamed we are. Can't say how sorry
  we are he caused you any inconvenience."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Mrs. Bowles, "our boy-servant ought not to have pelted
  him."</p>

  <p>"He didn't exactly pelt him, dear," said Madeleine....</p>

  <p>"Well, anyhow our friend ought not to have been off his chain. It was our
  affair to look after him and we didn't...."</p>

  <p>"You see," the open young man went on, with the air of lucid explanation,
  "he's our worst player. And he got round in a hundred and twenty-seven. And
  beat&mdash;somebody. And&mdash;it's upset him. It's not a bit of good
  disguising that we've been letting him drink.... We have. To begin with we
  encouraged him.... We oughtn't to have let him go. But we thought a walk
  alone might do him good. And some of us were a bit off him. Fed up rather.
  You see he'd been singing. Would go on singing...."</p>

  <p>He went on to propitiations. "Anything the club can do to show how we
  regret.... If you would like to pitch later on in our rough beyond the pine
  woods.... You'd find it safe and secluded.... Custodian&mdash;most civil man.
  Get you water or anything you wanted. Especially after all that has
  happened...."</p>

  <p>Bealby took no further part in these concluding politenesses. He had a
  curious feeling in his mind that perhaps he had not managed this affair quite
  so well as he might have done. He ought to have been more tactful like, more
  persuasive. He was a fool to have started chucking.... Well, well. He picked
  up the overturned kettle and went off down the hill to get water....</p>

  <p>What had she thought of him?....</p>

  <p>In the meantime one can at least boil kettles.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 12</h3>

  <p class="first">One consequence of this little incident of the rejoicing
golfer was that
  the three ladies were no longer content to dismiss William and Bealby at
  nightfall and sleep unprotected in the caravan. And this time their pitch was
  a lonely one with only the golf club-house within call. They were inclined
  even to distrust the golf club. So it was decided, to his great satisfaction,
  that Bealby should have a certain sleeping sack Mrs. Bowles had brought with
  her and that he should sleep therein between the wheels.</p>

  <p>This sleeping sack was to have been a great feature of the expedition, but
  when it came to the test Judy could not use it. She had not anticipated that
  feeling of extreme publicity the open air gives one at first. It was like
  having all the world in one's bedroom. Every night she had relapsed into the
  caravan.</p>

  <p>Bealby did not mind what they did with him so long as it meant sleeping.
  He had had a long day of it. He undressed sketchily and wriggled into the
  nice woolly bag and lay for a moment listening to the soft bumpings that were
  going on overhead. She was there. He had the instinctive confidence of our
  sex in women, and here were three of them. He had a vague idea of getting out
  of his bag again and kissing the underside of the van that held this dear
  beautiful creature....</p>

  <p>He didn't....</p>

  <p>Such a lot of things had happened that day&mdash; and the day before. He
  had been going without intermission, it seemed now for endless hours. He
  thought of trees, roads, dew-wet grass, frying-pans, pursuing packs of
  gigantic butlers hopelessly at fault,&mdash;no doubt they were hunting
  now,&mdash;chinks and crannies, tactless missiles flying, bursting, missiles
  it was vain to recall. He stared for a few seconds through the wheel spokes
  at the dancing, crackling fire of pine-cones which it had been his last duty
  to replenish, stared and blinked much as a little dog might do, and then he
  had slipped away altogether into the world of dreams....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 13</h3>

  <p class="first">In the morning he was extraordinarily hard to wake....</p>

  <p>"Is it after sleeping all day ye'd be?" cried Judy Bowles, who was always
  at her most Irish about breakfast-time.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4">IV. &mdash; THE UNOBTRUSIVE PARTING</a></h2>

  <h3>&sect; 1</h3>

  <p class="first">MONDAY was a happy day for Bealby. The caravan did
seventeen miles and
  came to rest at last in a sloping field outside a cheerful little village set
  about a green on which was a long tent professing to be a theatre.</p>

  <p>At the first stopping-place that possessed a general shop Mrs. Bowles
  bought Bealby a pair of boots. Then she had a bright idea. "Got any pocket
  money, Dick?" she asked.</p>

  <p>She gave him half a crown, that is to say she gave him two shillings and
  sixpence, or five sixpences or thirty pennies&mdash;according as you choose
  to look at it&mdash;in one large undivided shining coin.</p>

  <p>Even if he had not been in love here surely was incentive to a generous
  nature to help and do distinguished services. He dashed about doing things.
  The little accident on Sunday had warned him to be careful of the plates, and
  the only flaw upon a perfect day's service was the dropping of an egg on its
  way to the frying-pan for supper. It remained where it fell and there
  presently he gave it a quiet burial. There was nothing else to be done with
  it....</p>

  <p>All day long at intervals Miss Philips smiled at him and made him do
  little services for her. And in the evening, after the custom of her great
  profession when it keeps holiday, she insisted on going to the play. She said
  it would be the loveliest fun. She went with Mrs. Bowles because Mrs. Geedge
  wanted to sit quietly in the caravan and write down a few little things while
  they were still fresh in her mind. And it wasn't in the part of Madeleine
  Philips not to insist that both William and Bealby must go too; she gave them
  each a shilling&mdash;though the prices were sixpence, threepence, twopence
  and a penny&mdash;and Bealby saw his first real play.</p>

  <p>It was called Brothers in Blood or the Gentleman Ranker. There was a
  poster&mdash;which was only very slightly justified by the performance&mdash;
  of a man in khaki with a bandaged head proposing to sell his life dearly over
  a fallen comrade.</p>

  <p>One went to the play through an open and damaged field gate and across
  trampled turf. Outside the tent were two paraffin flares illuminating the
  poster and a small cluster of the impecunious young. Within on grass that was
  worn and bleached were benches, a gathering audience, a piano played by an
  offhand lady and a drop scene displa5dng the Grand Canal, Venice. The Grand
  Canal was infested by a crowded multitude of zealous and excessive
  reflections of the palaces above and by peculiar crescentic black boats
  floating entirely out of water and having no reflections at all. The off-hand
  lady gave a broad impression of the Wedding March in "Lohengrin" and the back
  seats assisted by a sort of gastric vocalization called humming and by
  whistling between the teeth. Madeleine Philips evidently found it tremendous
  fun, even before the curtain rose.</p>

  <p>And then&mdash;illusion....</p>

  <p>The scenery was ridiculous, it waved about, the actors and actresses were
  surely the most pitiful of their tribe and every invention in the play
  impossible, but the imagination of Bealby like the loving-kindness of God
  made no difficulties, it rose up and met and embraced and gave life to all
  these things. It was a confused story in the play, everybody was more or less
  somebody else all the way through, and it got more confused in Bealby's mind,
  but it was clear from the outset that there was vile work afoot, nets spread
  and sweet simple people wronged. And never were sweet and simple people quite
  so sweet and simple. There was the wrongful brother who was weak and wicked
  and the rightful brother who was vindictively, almost viciously good, and
  there was an ingrained villain who was a baronet, a man who wore a frock-coat
  and a silk hat and carried gloves and a stick in every scene and upon all
  occasions&mdash;that sort of man. He looked askance, always. There was a dear
  simple girl, with a vast sweet smile, who was loved according to their
  natures by the wrongful and the rightful brother, and a large wicked
  red-clad, lip-biting woman whose passions made the crazy little stage
  quiver. There was a comic butler&mdash;very different stuff from old
  Mergleson&mdash;who wore an evening coat and plaid trousers and nearly choked
  Bealby. Why weren't all butlers like that? Funny. And there were constant
  denunciations. Always there were denunciations going on or denunciations
  impending. That took Bealby particularly. Never surely in all the world were
  bad people so steadily and thoroughly scolded and told what. Everybody hissed
  them; Bealby hissed them. And when they were told what, he applauded. And yet
  they kept on with their wickedness to the very curtain. They
  retired&mdash;askance to the end. Foiled but pursuing. "A time will come,"
  they said.</p>

  <p>There was a moment in the distresses of the heroine when Bealby dashed
  aside a tear.</p>

  <p>And then at last most wonderfully it all came right. The company lined up
  and hoped that Bealby was satisfied. Bealby wished he had more hands. His
  heart seemed to fill his body. Oh prime I prime!....</p>

  <p>And out he came into the sympathetic night. But he was no longer a trivial
  Bealby, his soul was purged, he was a strong and silent man, ready to explode
  into generous repartee or nerve himself for high endeavour. He slipped off in
  the opposite direction from the caravan because he wanted to be alone for a
  time and feel. He did not want to jar upon a sphere of glorious illusion that
  had blown up in his mind like a bubble....</p>

  <p>He was quite sure that he had been wronged. Not to be wronged is to forgo
  the first privilege of goodness. He had been deeply wronged by a
  plot,&mdash;all those butlers were in the plot or why should they have chased
  him&mdash;he was much older than he really was, it had been kept from him,
  and in truth he was a rightful earl. "Earl Shonts," he whispered; and indeed,
  why not? And Madeleine too had been wronged; she had been reduced to wander
  in this uncomfortable caravan; this Gipsy Queen; she had been brought to it
  by villains, the same villains who had wronged Bealby....</p>

  <p>Out he went into the night, the kindly consenting summer night, where
  there is nothing to be seen or heard that will contradict these delicious
  wonderful persuasions.</p>

  <p>He was so full of these dreams that he strayed far away along the dark
  country lanes and had at last the utmost difficulty in finding his way back
  to the caravan. And when ultimately he got back after hours and hours of
  heroic existence it did not even seem that they had missed him. It did not
  seem that he had been away half an hour.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Tuesday was not so happy a day for Bealby as Monday.</p>

  <p>Its shadows began when Mrs. Bowles asked him in a friendly tone when it
  was clean-collar day.</p>

  <p>He was unready with his answer.</p>

  <p>"And don't you ever use a hair-brush, Dick?" she asked. "I'm sure now
  there's one in your parcel."</p>

  <p>"I do use it sometimes, Mum," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"And I've never detected you with a toothbrush yet. Though that perhaps is
  extreme. And Dick&mdash;soap? I think you'd better be letting me give you a
  cake of soap."</p>

  <p>"I'd be very much obliged. Mum."</p>

  <p>"I hardly dare hint, Dick, at a clean handkerchief. Such things are
  known."</p>

  <p>"If you wouldn't mind&mdash;when I've got the breakfast things done,
  Mum...."</p>

  <p>The thing worried him all through breakfast. He had not expected
  personalities from Mrs. Bowles. More particularly personalities of this kind.
  He felt he had to think hard.</p>

  <p>He affected modesty after he had cleared away breakfast, and carried off
  his little bundle to a point in the stream which was masked from the
  encampment by willows. With him he also brought that cake of soap. He began
  by washing his handkerchief, which was bad policy because that left him no
  dry towel but his jacket. He ought, he perceived, to have secured a
  dish-cloth or a newspaper. (This he must remember on the next occasion.) He
  did over his hands and the more exposed parts of his face with soap and
  jacket. Then he took off and examined his collar. It certainly was pretty
  bad....</p>

  <p>"Why!" cried Mrs. Bowles when he returned, "that's still the same
  collar."</p>

  <p>"They all seem to've got crumpled, 'm," said Bealby.</p>

  <p>"But are they all as dirty?"</p>

  <p>"I'd some blacking in my parcel," said Bealby, "and it got loose, Mum.
  I'll have to get another collar when we come to a shop."</p>

  <p>It was a financial sacrifice but it was the only way, and when they came
  to the shop Bealby secured a very nice collar indeed, high with pointed turn-
  down corners, so that it cut his neck all round, jabbed him under the chin
  and gave him a proud upcast carriage of the head that led to his treading
  upon and very completely destroying a stray plate while preparing lunch. But
  it was more of a man's collar, he felt, than anything he had ever worn
  before. And it cost sixpence halfpenny, six dee and a half.</p>

  <p>(I should have mentioned that while washing up the breakfast things he had
  already broken the handle off one of the breakfast-cups. Both these accidents
  deepened the cloud upon his day.)</p>

  <p>And then there was the trouble of William. William having meditated upon
  the differences between them for a day had now invented an activity. As
  Bealby sat beside him behind the white horse he was suddenly and frightfully
  pinched. Gee! One wanted to yelp.</p>

  <p>"Choc'late," said William through his teeth and very very savagely. "Now
  then."</p>

  <p>After William had done that twice Bealby preferred to walk beside the
  caravan. Thereupon William whipped up the white horse and broke records and
  made all the crockery sing together and forced the pace until he was spoken
  to by Mrs. Bowles....</p>

  <p>It was upon a Bealby thus depressed and worried that the rumour of
  impending " menfolk " came. It began after the party had stopped for letters
  at a village post-office; there were not only letters but a telegram, that
  Mrs. Bowles read with her spats far apart and her head on one side. "Ye'd
  like to know about it," she said waggishly to Miss Philips, "and you just
  shan't."</p>

  <p>She then went into her letters.</p>

  <p>"You've got some news," said Mrs. Geedge.</p>

  <p>"I have that," said Mrs. Bowles, and not a word more could they get from
  her....</p>

  <p>"I'll keep my news no longer," said Mrs. Bowles, lighting her cigarette
  after lunch as Bealby hovered about clearing away the banana skins and
  suchlike vestiges of dessert. "To-morrow night as ever is, if so be we get to
  Winthorpe-Sutbury, there'll be Men among us."</p>

  <p>"But Tom's not coming," said Mrs. Geedge. "He asked Tim to tell me to tell
  you."</p>

  <p>"And you've kept it these two hours, Judy."</p>

  <p>"For your own good and peace of mind. But now the murther's out. Come they
  will, your Man and my Man, pretending to a pity because they can't do without
  us. But like the self-indulgent monsters they are, they must needs stop at
  some grand hotel, Redlake he calls it, the Royal, on the hill above
  Winthorpe-Sutbury. The Royal! The very name describes it. Can't you see the
  lounge, girls, with its white cane chairs? And saddlebacks! No other hotel it
  seems is good enough for them, and we if you please are asked to go in and
  have&mdash;what does the man call it&mdash; the 'comforts of
  decency'&mdash;and let the caravan rest for a bit."</p>

  <p>"Tim promised me I should run wild as long as I chose," said Mrs. Geedge,
  looking anything but wild.</p>

  <p>"They're after thinking we've had enough of it," said Mrs. Bowles.</p>

  <p>"It sounds like that."</p>

  <p>"Sure I'd go on like this for ever," said Judy. "'Tis the Man and the
  House and all of it that oppresses me. Vans for Women...."</p>

  <p>"Let's not go to Winthorpe-Sutbury," said Madeleine.</p>

  <p>(The first word of sense Bealby had heard.)</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Mrs. Bowles archly, "who knows but what there'll be a Man for
  you? Some sort of Man anyhow."</p>

  <p>(Bealby thought that a most improper remark.)</p>

  <p>"I want no man."</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>"Why do you say <i>Ah</i> like that?"</p>

  <p>"Because I mean <i>Ah</i> like that."</p>

  <p>"Meaning?"</p>

  <p>"Just that."</p>

  <p>Miss Philips eyed Mrs. Bowles and Mrs. Bowles eyed Miss Philips.</p>

  <p>"Judy," she said, "you've got something up your sleeve."</p>

  <p>"Where it's perfectly comfortable," said Mrs. Bowles.</p>

  <p>And then quite maddeningly, she remarked, "Will you be after washing up
  presently, Dick?" and looked at him with a roguish quiet over her cigarette.
  It was necessary to disabuse her mind at once of the idea that he had been
  listening. He took up the last few plates and went off to the washing place
  by the stream. All the rest of that conversation had to be lost.</p>

  <p>Except that as he came back for the Hudson's soap he heard Miss Philips
  say, "Keep your old Men. I'll just console myself with Dick, my dears. Making
  such a Mystery!"</p>

  <p>To which Mrs. Bowles replied darkly, "She little knows...."</p>

  <p>A kind of consolation was to be got from that.... But what was it she
  little knew?....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 3</h3>

  <p class="first">The men-folk when they came were nothing so terrific to the
sight as
  Bealby had expected. And thank Heaven there were only two of them and each
  assigned. Something he perceived was said about someone else, he couldn't
  quite catch what, but if there was to have been someone else, at any rate
  there now wasn't. Professor Bowles was animated and Mr. Geedge was gracefully
  cold, they kissed their wives but not offensively, and there was a chattering
  pause while Bealby walked on beside the caravan. They were on the bare road
  that runs along the high ridge above Winthorpe-Sutbury, and the men had
  walked to meet them from some hotel or other&mdash;Bealby wasn't clear about
  that&mdash;by the golf links. Judy was the life and soul of the encounter,
  and all for asking the men what they meant by intruding upon three
  independent women who, sure-alive, could very well do without them. Professor
  Bowles took her pretty calmly, and seemed on the whole to admire her.</p>

  <p>Professor Bowles was a compact little man wearing spectacles with
  alternative glasses, partly curved, partly fiat, he was hairy and dressed in
  that sort of soft tweedy stuff that ravels out&mdash;he seemed to have been
  sitting among thorns&mdash;and baggy knickerbockers with straps and very
  thick stockings and very sensible, open-air, in fact quite mountainous,
  boots. And yet though he was short and stout and active he had a kind of
  authority about him, and it was clear that for all her persuasiveness his
  wife merely ran over him like a creeper without making any great difference
  to him. "I've found," he said, "the perfect place for your encampment." She
  had been making suggestions. And presently he left the ladies and came
  hurrying after the caravan to take control.</p>

  <p>He was evidently a very controlling person.</p>

  <p>"Here, you get down," he said to William. "That poor beast's got enough to
  pull without you."</p>

  <p>And when William mumbled he said, "Hey?" in such a shout that William for
  ever after held his peace.</p>

  <p>"Where d'you come from, you boy, you?" he asked suddenly, and Bealby
  looked to Mrs. Bowles to explain.</p>

  <p>"Great silly collar you've got," said the Professor, interrupting her
  reply. "Boy like this ought to wear a wool shirt. Dirty too. Take it off,
  boy. It's choking you. Don't you feel it?"</p>

  <p>Then he went on to make trouble about the tackle William had rigged to
  contain the white horse.</p>

  <p>"This harness makes me sick," said Professor Bowles. "It's worse than
  Italy...."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he cried and suddenly darted off across the turf, going inelegantly
  and very rapidly, with peculiar motions of the head and neck as he brought
  first the flat and then the curved surface of his glasses into play. Finally
  he dived into the turf, remained scrabbling on all fours for a moment or so,
  became almost still for the fraction of a minute and then got up and returned
  to his wife, holding in an exquisite manner something that struggled between
  his finger and his thumb.</p>

  <p>"That's the third to-day," he said, triumphantly. "They swarm here. It's a
  migration."</p>

  <p>Then he resumed his penetrating criticism of the caravan outfit.</p>

  <p>"That boy," he said suddenly with his glasses oblique, "hasn't taken off
  his collar yet."</p>

  <p>Bealby revealed the modest secrets of his neck and pocketed the
  collar....</p>

  <p>Mr. Geedge did not appear to observe Bealby. He was a man of the super-
  aquiline type with a nose like a rudder, he held his face as if it was a
  hatchet in a procession, and walked with the dignity of a man of honour. You
  could see at once he was a man of honour. Inflexibly, invincibly he was a man
  of honour. You felt that anywhen, in a fire, in an earthquake, in a railway
  accident when other people would be running about and doing things he would
  have remained&mdash;a man of honour. It was his pride rather than his vanity
  to be mistaken for Sir Edward Grey. He now walked along with Miss Philips and
  his wife behind the disputing Bowleses, and discoursed in deep sonorous tones
  about the healthiness of healthy places and the stifling feeling one had in
  towns when there was no air.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 4</h3>

  <p class="first">The Professor was remarkably active when at last the point
he had chosen
  for the encampment was reached. Bealby was told to " look alive " twice, and
  William was assigned to his genus and species: " The man's an absolute
  idiot," was the way the Professor put it. William just shot a glance at him
  over his nose.</p>

  <p>The place certainly commanded a wonderful view. It was a turfy bank
  protected from the north and south by bushes of yew and the beech-bordered
  edge of a chalk pit; it was close beside the road, a road which went steeply
  down the hill into Winthorpe-Sutbury, with that intrepid decision peculiar to
  the hill-roads of the south of England. It looked indeed as though you could
  throw the rinse of your teacups into the Winthorpe-Sutbury street; as if you
  could jump and impale yourself upon the church spire. The hills bellied out
  east and west and carried hangers, and then swept round to the west in a long
  level succession of projections, a perspective that merged at last with the
  general horizon of hilly bluenesses, amidst which Professor Bowles insisted
  upon a "sapphire glimpse" of sea. "The Channel," said Professor Bowles, as
  though that made it easier for them. Only Mr. Geedge refused to see even that
  mitigated version of the sea. There was something perhaps bluish and level,
  but he was evidently not going to admit it was sea until he had paddled in it
  and tested it in every way known to him....</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" cried the Professor. "What's the man doing now?"</p>

  <p>William stopped the struggles and confidential discouragements he was
  bestowing upon the white horse and waited for a more definite reproach.</p>

  <p>"Putting the caravan alongside to the sun! Do you think it will ever get
  cool again? And think of the blaze of the sunset&mdash;through the glass of
  that door!"</p>

  <p>William spluttered. "If I put'n t'other way &mdash;goo runnin' down t'hill
  like," said William.</p>

  <p>"Imbecile!" cried the Professor. "Put something under the wheels. Here!"
  He careered about and produced great grey fragments of a perished yew tree.
  "Now then," he said. "Head up hill."</p>

  <p>William did his best.</p>

  <p>"Oh! not like that! Here, you!"</p>

  <p>Bealby assisted with obsequious enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>It was some time before the caravan was adjusted to the complete
  satisfaction of the Professor. But at last it was done, and the end door
  gaped at the whole prospect of the Weald with the steps hanging out
  idiotically like a tongue. The hind wheels were stayed up very cleverly by
  lumps of chalk and chunks of yew, living and dead, and certainly the effect
  of it was altogether taller and better. And then the preparations for the
  midday cooking began. The Professor was full of acute ideas about camping and
  cooking, and gave Bealby a lively but instructive time. There was no stream
  handy, but William was sent off to the hotel to fetch a garden water-cart
  that the Professor with infinite foresight had arranged should be ready.</p>

  <p>The Geedges held aloof from these preparations, they were unassuming
  people, Miss Philips concentrated her attention upon the Weald&mdash;it
  seemed to Bealby a little discontentedly, as if it was unworthy of
  her&mdash;and Mrs. Bowles hovered, smoking cigarettes, over her husband' 5
  activities, acting great amusement.</p>

  <p>"You see it pleases me to get Himself busy," she said. "You'll end a
  Camper yet, Darlint, and us in the hotel."</p>

  <p>The Professor answered nothing, but seemed to plunge deeper into
  practicality.</p>

  <p>Under the urgency of Professor Bowles Bealby stumbled and broke a glass
  jar of marmalade over some fried potatoes, but otherwise did well as a cook's
  assistant. Once things were a little interrupted by the Professor going off
  to catch a cricket, but whether it was the right sort of cricket or not he
  failed to get it. And then with three loud reports&mdash; for a moment Bealby
  thought the mad butlers from Shonts were upon him with firearms&mdash;
  Captain Douglas arrived and got off his motor bicycle and left it by the
  roadside. His machine accounted for his delay, for those were the early days
  of motor bicycles. It also accounted for a black smudge under one of his
  bright little eyes. He was fair and flushed, dressed in oilskins and a
  helmet-shaped cap and great gauntlets that made him, in spite of the smudge,
  look strange and brave and handsome like a Crusader&mdash;only that he was
  clad in oilskin and not steel, and his moustache was smaller than those of
  Crusaders were&mdash;and when he came across the turf to the encampment Mrs.
  Bowles and Mrs. Geedge both set up a cry of "A-Ah!" and Miss Philips turned
  an accusing face upon those two ladies. Bealby knelt with a bunch of knives
  and forks in his hand laying the cloth for lunch, and when he saw Captain
  Douglas approaching Miss Philips, he perceived clearly that that lady had
  already forgotten her lowly adorer, and his little heart was smitten with
  desolation. This man was arrayed like a chivalrous god, and how was a poor
  Bealby, whose very collar, his one little circlet of manhood, had been reft
  from him, how was he to compete with this tremendousness? In that hour the
  ambition for mechanism, the passion for leather and oilskin was sown in
  Bealby's heart.</p>

  <p>"I told you not to come near me for a month," said Madeleine, but her face
  was radiant.</p>

  <p>"These motor bicycles&mdash;very difficult to control," said Captain
  Douglas, and all the little golden-white hairs upon his sunlit cheek
  glittered in the sun,</p>

  <p>"And besides," said Mrs. Bowles, "it's all nonsense."</p>

  <p>The Professor was in a state of arrested administration; the three others
  were frankly audience to a clearly understood scene.</p>

  <p>"You ought to be in France."</p>

  <p>"I'm not in France."</p>

  <p>"I sent you into exile for a month," and she held out a hand for the
  Captain to kiss.</p>

  <p>He kissed it.</p>

  <p>Someday, somewhere, it was written in the book of destiny Bealby should
  also kiss hands. It was a lovely thing to do.</p>

  <p>"Month! It's been years," said the Captain. "Years and years."</p>

  <p>"Then you ought to have come back before," she replied, and the Captain
  had no answer ready....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 5</h3>

  <p class="first">When William arrived with the water-cart, he brought also
further proofs
  of the Professor's organizing ability. He brought various bottles of wine,
  red Burgundy and sparkling hock, two bottles of cider, and peculiar and
  meritorious waters; he brought tinned things for hors d'oeuvre; he brought
  some luscious pears.</p>

  <p>When he had a moment with Bealby behind the caravan he repeated thrice in
  tones of hopeless sorrow, "They'll eat 'um all. I knows they'll eat 'um all."
  And then plumbing a deeper tone of woe, "Ef they don't they'll count 'um. Ode
  Goggles'll bag 'um.... 'E's a bagger, 'e is."</p>

  <p>It was the brightest of luncheons that was eaten that day in the sunshine
  and spaciousness above Winthorpe-Sutbury. Everyone was gay, and even the
  love-lorn Bealby who might well have sunk into depression and lethargy was
  galvanized into an activity that was almost cheerful by flashes from the
  Professor's glasses.</p>

  <p>They talked of this and that; Bealby hadn't much time to attend, though
  the laughter that followed various sallies from Judy Bowles was very
  tantalizing, and it had come to the pears before his attention wasn't so much
  caught as felled by the word " Shonts "....</p>

  <p>It was as if the sky had suddenly changed to vermilion. <i>All these
  people were talking of Shouts!...</i></p>

  <p>"Went there," said Captain Douglas, "in perfect good faith. Wanted to fill
  up Lucy's little party. One doesn't go to Shonts nowadays for idle pleasure.
  And then&mdash;I get ordered out of the house, absolutely Told to Go."</p>

  <p>(This man had been at Shonts!)</p>

  <p>"That was on Sunday morning?" said Mrs. Geedge.</p>

  <p>"On Sunday morning," said Mrs. Bowles suddenly, "we were almost within
  sight of Shonts."</p>

  <p>(This man had been at Shonts even at the time when Bealby was there!)</p>

  <p>"Early on Sunday morning. Told to go. I was fairly flabbergasted. What the
  deuce is a man to do? Where's he to go? Sunday? One doesn't go to places,
  Sunday morning. There I'd been sleeping like a lamb all night and suddenly in
  came Laxton and said, 'Look here, you know,' he said, 'you've got to oblige
  me and pack your bag and go. Now.' 'Why?' said I. 'Because you've driven the
  Lord Chancellor stark staring mad!'"</p>

  <p>"But how?" asked the Professor almost angrily, "how? I don't see it. Why
  should he ask you to go?"</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> don't know!" cried Captain Douglas.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but!" said the Professor, protesting against the unreasonableness of
  mankind.</p>

  <p>"I'd had a word or two with him in the train. Nothing to speak of. About
  occupying two corner seats&mdash;always strikes me as a cad's trick&mdash;but
  on my honour I didn't rub it in. And then he got it into his head we were
  laughing at him at dinner&mdash;we were a bit, but only the sort of thing one
  says about anyone&mdash; way he works his eyebrows and all that&mdash;and
  then he thought I was ragging him.... I don't rag people. Got it so strongly
  he made a row that night. Said I'd made a ghost slap him on his back. Hang
  it!&mdash;what can you say to a thing like that? In my room all the
  time."</p>

  <p>"You suffer for the sins of your brother," said Mrs. Bowles.</p>

  <p>"Heavens!" cried the Captain, "I never thought of that! Perhaps he mistook
  me...."</p>

  <p>He reflected for a moment and continued his narrative. "Then in the night,
  you know, he heard noises."</p>

  <p>"They always do," said the Professor nodding confirmation.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't sleep."</p>

  <p>"A sure sign," said the Professor.</p>

  <p>"And finally he sallied out in the early morning, caught the butler in one
  of the secret passages "</p>

  <p>"How did the butler get into the secret passage?"</p>

  <p>"Going round, I suppose. Part of his duties.... Anyhow he gave the poor
  beggar an awful doing&mdash;awful&mdash;brutal&mdash;black eye,&mdash; all
  that sort of thing; man much too respectful to hit back. Finally declared I'd
  been getting up a kind of rag,&mdash;squaring the servants to help and so
  forth.... Laxton, I fancy, half believed it.... Awkward thing, you know,
  having it said about that you ragged the Lord Chancellor. Makes a man seem a
  sort of mischievous idiot. Injures a man. Then going away, you see, seems a
  kind of admission...."</p>

  <p>"Why did you go?"</p>

  <p>"Lucy," said the Captain compactly. "Hysterics.</p>

  <p>"Shonts would have burst," he added, "if I hadn't gone."</p>

  <p>Madeleine was helpful. "But you'll have to do something further," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"What is one to do 7 "squealed the Captain.</p>

  <p>"The sooner you get the Lord Chancellor certified a lunatic," said the
  Professor soundly, "the better for your professional prospects."</p>

  <p>"He went on pretty bad after I'd gone."</p>

  <p>"You've heard?"</p>

  <p>"Two letters. I picked 'em up at Wheatley Post Office this morning. You
  know he hadn't done with that butler. Actually got out of his place and
  scruffed the poor devil at lunch. Shook him like a rat, she says. Said the
  man wasn't giving him anything to drink&mdash;nice story, eh? Anyhow he
  scruffed him until things got broken....</p>

  <p>"I had it all from Minnie Timbre&mdash;you know, used to be Minnie Flax."
  He shot a propitiatory glance at Madeleine. "Used to be neighbours of ours
  you know, in the old time. Half the people, she says, didn't know what was
  happening. Thought the butler was apoplectic and that old Moggeridge was
  helping him stand up. Taking off his collar. It was Laxton thought of saying
  it was a fit. Told everybody she says. Had to tell 'em Something, I suppose.
  But she saw better, and she thinks a good many others did. Laxton ran 'em
  both out of the room. Nice scene for Shouts, eh? Thundering awkward for poor
  Lucy. Not the sort of thing the county expected. Has her both ways. Can't go
  to a house where the Lord Chancellor goes mad. One alternative. Can't go to a
  house where the butler has fits. That's the other. See the dilemma?..."</p>

  <p>"I've got a letter from Lucy too. It's here"&mdash;he
  struggled&mdash;"See? Eight sheets&mdash; pencil. No Joke for a man to read
  that. And she writes worse than any decent, self-respecting, illiterate woman
  has a right to do. Quivers. Like writing in a train. Can't read half of it.
  But she's got something about a boy on her mind. Mad about a boy. Have I
  taken away a boy? They've lost a boy. Took him in my luggage, I suppose.
  She'd better write to the Lord Chancellor. Likely as not he met him in some
  odd corner and flew at him. Smashed him to atoms. Dispersed him. Anyhow
  they've lost a boy."</p>

  <p>He protested to the world. "<i>I</i> can't go hunting lost boys for Lucy.
  I've done enough coming away as I did...."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bowles held out an arresting cigarette.</p>

  <p>"What sort of boy was lost?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Some little beast of a boy. I daresay she'd only imagined
  it. Whole thing been too much for her."</p>

  <p>"Read that over again," said Mrs. Bowles, "about losing a boy. We've found
  one."</p>

  <p>"That little chap?"</p>

  <p>"We found that boy"&mdash; she glanced over her shoulder, but Bealby was
  nowhere to be seen&mdash; "on Sunday morning near Shonts. He strayed into us
  like a lost kitten."</p>

  <p>"But I thought you said you knew his father, Judy," objected the
  Professor.</p>

  <p>"Didn't verify," said Mrs. Bowles shortly, and then to Captain Douglas,
  "Read over again what Lady Laxton says about him...."</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 6</h3>

  <p class="first">Captain Douglas struggled with the difficulties of his
cousin's
  handwriting.</p>

  <p>Everybody drew together over the fragments of the dessert with an eager
  curiosity, and helped to weigh Lady Laxton's rather dishevelled
  phrases....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 7</h3>

  <p class="first">"We'll call the principal witness," said Mrs. Bowles at
last, warming to
  the business. "Dick!"</p>

  <p>"Di&mdash;ick!"</p>

  <p>"Dick!"</p>

  <p>The Professor got up and strolled round behind the caravan. Then he
  returned. "No boy there."</p>

  <p>"He heard!" said Mrs. Bowles in a large whisper and making round wonder-
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"She says," said Douglas, "that the chances are he's got into the secret
  passages...."</p>

  <p>The Professor strolled out to the road and looked up it and then down upon
  the roofs of Winthorpe-Sutbury. "No," he said. "He's mizzled."</p>

  <p>"He's only gone away for a bit," said Mrs. Geedge. "He does sometimes
  after lunch. He'll come back to wash up."</p>

  <p>"He's probably taking a snooze among the yew bushes before facing the
  labours of washing up," said Mrs. Bowles. "He can't have mizzled. You
  see&mdash;in there He can't by any chance have taken his luggage!"</p>

  <p>She got up and clambered&mdash;with a little difficulty because of its
  piled-up position, into the caravan. "It's all right," she called out of the
  door. "His little parsivel is still here."</p>

  <p>Her head disappeared again.</p>

  <p>"I don't think he'd go away like this," said Madeleine. "After all, what
  is there for him to go to&mdash;even if he is Lady Laxton's missing
  boy...."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe he heard a word of it," said Mrs. Geedge....</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bowles reappeared, with a curious-looking brown-paper parcel in her
  hand. She descended carefully. She sat down by the fire and held the parcel
  on her knees. She regarded it and her companions waggishly and lit a fresh
  cigarette. "Our link with Dick," she said, with the cigarette in her
  mouth.</p>

  <p>She felt the parcel, she poised the parcel, she looked at it more and more
  waggishly. "I wonder?" she said.</p>

  <p>Her expression became so waggish that her husband knew she was committed
  to behaviour of the utmost ungentlemanliness. He had long ceased to attempt
  restraint in these moods. She put her head on one side and tore open the
  corner of the parcel just a little way.</p>

  <p>"A tin can," she said in a stage whisper.</p>

  <p>She enlarged the opening. "Blades of grass," she said.</p>

  <p>The Professor tried to regard it humorously. "Even if you have ceased to
  be decent you can still be frank.... I think now, my dear, you might just
  straightforwardly undo the parcel."</p>

  <p>She did. Twelve unsympathetic eyes surveyed the evidences of Bealby's
  utter poverty.</p>

  <p>"He's coming," cried Madeleine suddenly.</p>

  <p>Judy re-packed hastily, but it was a false alarm.</p>

  <p>"I said he'd mizzled," said the Professor.</p>

  <p>"And without washing up!" wailed Madeleine. "I couldn't have thought it of
  him...."</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 8</h3>

  <p class="first">But Bealby had not " mizzled " although he was
conspicuously not in
  evidence about the camp. There was neither sight nor sound of him for all the
  time they sat about the vestiges of their meal. They talked of him and of
  topics arising out of him, and whether the Captain should telegraph to Lady
  Laxton, "Boy practically found."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather just find him," said the Captain, "and anyhow until we get
  hold of him we don't know it's her particular boy."</p>

  <p>Then they talked of washing-up and how detestable it was. And suddenly the
  two husbands, seeing their advantage, renewed their proposals that the
  caravanners should put up at the golf-links hotel, and have baths and the
  comforts of civilization for a night or so&mdash;and anyhow walk thither for
  tea. And as William had now returned&mdash;he was sitting on the turf afar
  off smoking a nasty-looking short clay pipe&mdash;they rose up and departed.
  But Captain Douglas and Miss Philips for some reason did not go off exactly
  with the others but strayed apart, straying away more and more into a kind of
  solitude....</p>

  <p>First the four married people and then the two lovers disappeared over the
  crest of the downs....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 9</h3>

  <p class="first">For a time except for its distant sentinel the caravan
seemed absolutely
  deserted, and then a clump of bramble against the wall of the old chalk-pit
  became agitated and a small, rueful, disillusioned, white-smeared little
  Bealby crept back into the visible universe again. His heart was very
  heavy.</p>

  <p>The time had come to go.</p>

  <p>And he did not want to go. He had loved the caravan. He had adored
  Madeleine.</p>

  <p>He would go, but he would go beautifully&mdash; touchingiy.</p>

  <p>He would wash up before he went, he would make everything tidy, he would
  leave behind him a sense of irreparable loss....</p>

  <p>With a mournful precision he set about this undertaking. If Mergleson
  could have seen him Mergleson would have been amazed....</p>

  <p>He made everything look wonderfully tidy.</p>

  <p>Then m the place where she had sat, lying on her rug, he found her
  favourite book, a small volume of Swinburne's poems very beautifully bound.
  Captain Douglas had given it to her.</p>

  <p>Bealby handled it with a kind of reverence. So luxurious it was, so unlike
  the books in Bealby's world, so altogether of her quality....</p>

  <p>Strange forces prompted him. For a time he hesitated. Then decision came
  with a rush. He selected a page, drew the stump of a pencil from his pocket,
  wetted it very wet and, breathing hard, began to write that traditional
  message, "Farewell. Remember Art Bealby."</p>

  <p>To this he made an original addition: "I washt up before I went."</p>

  <p>Then he remembered that so far as this caravan went he was not Art Bealby
  at all.</p>

  <p>He renewed the wetness of his pencil and drew black lines athwart the name
  of "Art Bealby" until it was quite unreadable; then across this again and
  pressing still deeper so that the subsequent pages re-echoed it he wrote
  these singular words, "Ed rightful Earl Shonts." Then he was ashamed, and
  largely obliterated this by still more forcible strokes. Finally above it all
  plainly and nakedly he wrote "Dick Maltravers...."</p>

  <p>He put down the book with a sigh and stood up.</p>

  <p>Everything was beautifully in order. But could he not do something yet?
  There came to him the idea of wreathing the entire camping place with boughs
  of yew. It would look lovely&mdash;and significant. He set to work. At first
  he toiled zealously, but yew is tough to get and soon his hands were painful.
  He cast about for some easier way, and saw beneath the hind wheels of the
  caravan great green boughs&mdash;one particularly a splendid long branch....
  It seemed to him that it would be possible to withdraw this branch from the
  great heap of sticks and stones that stayed up the hind wheels of the
  caravan. It seemed to him that that was so. He was mistaken, but that was his
  idea.</p>

  <p>He set to work to do it. It was rather more difficult to manage than he
  had supposed; there were unexpected ramifications, wider resistances. Indeed
  the thing seemed rooted.</p>

  <p>Bealby was a resolute youngster at bottom.</p>

  <p>He warmed to his task.... He tugged harder and harder....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 10</h3>

  <p class="first">How various is the quality of humanity!</p>

  <p>About Bealby there was ever an imaginative touch; he was capable of
  romance, of gallantries, of devotion. William was of a grosser clay, slave of
  his appetites, a materialist. Such men as William drive one to believe in
  born inferiors, in the existence of a lower sort, in the natural inequality
  of men.</p>

  <p>While Bealby was busy at his little gentle task of reparation, a task
  foolish perhaps and not too ably conceived, but at any rate morally gracious,
  William had no thought in the world but the satisfaction of those appetites
  that the consensus of all mankind has definitely relegated to the lower
  category. And which Heaven has relegated to the lower region of our frame. He
  came now slinking towards the vestiges of the caravanners' picnic, and no one
  skilled in the interpretation of the human physiognomy could have failed to
  read the significance of the tongue tip that drifted over his thin oblique
  lips. He came so softly towards the encampment that Bealby did not note him.
  Partly William thought of remnants of food but chiefly he was intent to drain
  the bottles. Bealby had stuck them all neatly in a row a little way up the
  hill. There was a cider bottle with some heel-taps of cider, William drank
  that; then there was nearly half a bottle of hock and William drank that,
  then there were the drainings of the Burgundy and Apollinaris. It was all
  drink to William.</p>

  <p>And after he had drained each bottle William winked at the watching angels
  and licked his lips, and patted the lower centres of his being with a
  shameless base approval. Then fired by alcohol, robbed of his last vestiges
  of self-control, his thoughts turned to the delicious chocolates that were
  stored in a daintily beribboned box in the little drawers beneath the
  sleeping bunk of Miss Philips. There was a new brightness in his eye, a spot
  of pink in either cheek. With an expression of the lowest cunning he
  reconnoitred Bealby.</p>

  <p>Bealby was busy about something at the back end of the caravan, tugging at
  something.</p>

  <p>With swift stealthy movements of an entirely graceless sort, William got
  up into the front of the caravan.</p>

  <p>Just for a moment he hesitated before going in. He craned his neck to look
  round the side at the unconscious Bealby, wrinkled the vast nose into an
  unpleasant grimace and then&mdash; a crouching figure of appetite&mdash;he
  crept inside.</p>

  <p>Here they were! He laid his hand in the drawer, halted listening....</p>

  <p>What was that?....</p>

  <p>Suddenly the caravan swayed. He stumbled, and fear crept into his craven
  soul. The caravan lurched. It was moving.... Its hind wheels came to the
  ground with a crash....</p>

  <p>He took a step doorward and was pitched sideways and thrown upon his
  knees.... Then he was hurled against the dresser and hit by a falling plate.
  A cup fell and smashed and the caravan seemed to leap and bound....</p>

  <p>Through the little window he had a glimpse of yew bushes hurrying upward.
  The caravan was going downhill....</p>

  <p>"Lummy!" said William, clutching at the bunks to hold himself
  upright....</p>

  <p>"Ca-arnt be that drink!" said William, aspread and aghast....</p>

  <p>He attempted the door.</p>

  <p>"Crikey! Here! Hold on! My shin!.... 'Tis thut Brasted Vool of a Boy!"</p>

  <p>"...." said William. "....______...."</p>

  <p>"&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull; &bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;
  &bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;"</p>

  <p>"&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;"</p>

  <p>"&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;"</p>

  <p>"&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;"</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 11</h3>

  <p class="first">The caravan party soon came to its decision. They would
stay the night in
  the hotel. And so as soon as they had had some tea they decided to go back
  and make William bring the caravan and all the ladies' things round to the
  hotel. With characteristic eagerness Professor Bowles led the way.</p>

  <p>And so it was Professor Bowles who first saw the release of the caravan.
  He barked. One short sharp bark. "Whup!" he cried, and very quickly,
  "Whatstheboy doing?"</p>

  <p>Then quite a different style of noise, with the mouth open:
  "Wha&mdash;hoop!"</p>

  <p>Then he set off running very fast down towards the caravan, waving his
  arms and shouting as he ran, "Yaaps! You Idiot. Yaaps!"</p>

  <p>The others were less promptly active.</p>

  <p>Down the slope they saw Bealby, a little struggling active Bealby, tugging
  away at a yew branch until the caravan swayed with his efforts, and
  then&mdash;then there was a movement as though the thing tossed its head and
  reared, and a smash as the heap of stuff that stayed up its hind wheels
  collapsed....</p>

  <p>It plunged like a horse with a dog at its heels, it lurched sideways, and
  then with an air of quiet deliberation started down the grass slope to the
  road and Winthorpe-Sutbury....</p>

  <p>Professor Bowles sped in pursuit like the wind, and Mrs. Bowles after a
  gasping moment set off after her lord, her face round and resolute. Mr.
  Geedge followed at a more dignified pace, making the only really sound
  suggestion that was offered on that occasion. "Hue! Stop it!" cried Mr.
  Geedge, for all the world like his great prototype at the Balkan Conference.
  And then like a large languid pair of scissors he began to run. Mrs. Geedge
  after some indefinite moments decided to see the humour of it all, and
  followed her husband, in a fluttering rush, emitting careful little musical
  giggles as she ran, giggles that she had learnt long ago from a beloved
  schoolfellow. Captain Douglas and Miss Philips were some way behind the
  others, and the situation had already developed considerably before they
  grasped what was happening. Then obeying the instincts of a soldier the
  Captain came charging to support the others, and Miss Madeleine Philips after
  some wasted gestures realized that nobody was looking at her, and sat down
  quietly on the turf until this paralysing state of affairs should cease.</p>

  <p>The caravan remained the centre of interest.</p>

  <p>Without either indecent haste or any complete pause it pursued its way
  down the road towards the tranquil village below. Except for the rumbling of
  its wheels and an occasional concussion it made very little sound; once or
  twice there was a faint sound of breaking crockery from its interior and once
  the phantom of an angry yell, but that was all.</p>

  <p>There was an effect of discovered personality about the thing. This
  vehicle which had hitherto been content to play a background part, a yellow
  patch amidst the scenery, was now revealing an individuality. It was
  purposeful and touched with a suggestion of playfulness, at once kindly and
  human; it had its thoughtful instants, its phases of quick decision, yet
  never once did it altogether lose a certain mellow dignity. There was nothing
  servile about it; never for a moment for example did it betray its blind
  obedience to gravitation. It was rather as if it and gravitation were going
  hand in hand. It came out into the road, butted into the bank, swept round,
  meditated for a full second, and then headed downhill, shafts foremost, going
  quietly faster and faster and swaying from bank to bank. The shafts went
  before it like arms held out....</p>

  <p>It had a quality&mdash;as if it were a favourite elephant running to a
  beloved master from whom it had been over-long separated. Or a slightly
  intoxicated and altogether happy yellow guinea-pig making for some coveted
  food....</p>

  <p>At a considerable distance followed Professor Bowles, a miracle of compact
  energy, running so fast that he seemed only to touch the ground at very rare
  intervals....</p>

  <p>And then, dispersedly, in their order and according to their natures, the
  others....</p>

  <p>There was fortunately very little on the road.</p>

  <p>There was a perambulator containing twins, whose little girl guardian was
  so lucky as to be high up on the bank gathering blackberries.</p>

  <p>A ditcher, ditching.</p>

  <p>A hawker lost in thought.</p>

  <p>His cart, drawn by a poor little black screw of a pony and loaded with the
  cheap flawed crockery that is so popular among the poor.</p>

  <p>A dog asleep in the middle of the village street....</p>

  <p>Amidst this choice of objects the caravan displayed a whimsical humanity.
  It reduced the children in the perambulator to tears, but passed. It might
  have reduced them to a sort of red-currant jelly. It lurched heavily towards
  the ditcher and spared him, it chased the hawker up the bank, it whipped off
  a wheel from the cart of crockery (which after an interval of astonishment
  fell like a vast objurgation) and then it directed its course with a grim
  intentness towards the dog.</p>

  <p>It just missed the dog. He woke up not a moment too soon. He fled with a
  yelp of dismay.</p>

  <p>And then the caravan careered on a dozen yards farther, lost energy
  and&mdash;the only really undignified thing in its whole career&mdash;stood
  on its head in a wide wet ditch. It did this with just the slightest lapse
  into emphasis. There! It was as if it gave a grunt&mdash;and perhaps there
  was the faintest suggestion of William in that grunt&mdash;and then it became
  quite still....</p>

  <p>For a time the caravan seemed finished and done. Its steps hung from its
  upper end like the tongue of a tired dog. Except for a few minute noises as
  though it was scratching itself inside, it was as inanimate as death
  itself.</p>

  <p>But up the hill road the twins were weeping, the hawker and the ditcher
  were saying raucous things, the hawker's pony had backed into the ditch and
  was taking ill-advised steps, for which it was afterwards to be sorry, amidst
  the stock-in-trade, and Professor Bowles, Mrs. Bowles, Mr. Geedge, Captain
  Douglas and Mrs. Geedge were running&mdash;running&mdash;one heard the
  various patter of their feet.</p>

  <p>And then came signs of life at the upward door of the caravan, a hand, an
  arm, an active investigating leg seeking a hold, a large nose, a small intent
  vicious eye; in fact&mdash;William.</p>

  <p>William maddened.</p>

  <p>Professor Bowles had reached the caravan. With a startlIng agility he
  clambered up by the wheels and step and confronted the unfortunate driver. It
  was an occasion for mutual sympathy rather than anger, but the Professor was
  hasty, efficient and unsympathetic with the lower classes, and William's was
  an ill-regulated temperament.</p>

  <p>"You consummate ass!" began Professor Bowles....</p>

  <p>When William heard Professor Bowles say this, incontinently he smote him
  in the face, and when Professor Bowles was smitten in the face he grappled
  instantly and very bravely and resolutely with William.</p>

  <p>For a moment they struggled fearfully, they seemed to be endowed
  instantaneously with innumerable legs, and then suddenly they fell through
  the door of the caravan into the interior, their limbs seemed to whirl for a
  wonderful instant and then they were swallowed up....</p>

  <p>The smash was tremendous. You would not have thought there was nearly so
  much in the caravan still left to get broken....</p>

  <p>A healing silence....</p>

  <p>At length smothered noises of still inadequate adjustment within... ,</p>

  <p>The village population in a state of scared delight appeared at a score of
  points and converged upon the catastrophe. Sounds of renewed dissension
  between William and the Professor inside the rearing yellow bulk, promised
  further interests and added an element of mystery to this manifest
  disaster.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 12</h3>

  <p class="first">As Bealby, still grasping his great branch of yew, watched
these events, a
  sense of human futility invaded his youthful mind. For the first time he
  realized the gulf between intention and result. He had meant so well....</p>

  <p>He perceived it would be impossible to explain....</p>

  <p>The thought of even attempting to explain things to Professor Bowles was
  repellent to him,....</p>

  <p>He looked about him with round despairful eyes. He selected a direction
  which seemed to promise the maximum of concealment with the minimum of
  conversational possibility, and in that direction and without needless delay
  he set off, eager to turn over an entirely fresh page in his destiny as soon
  as possible....</p>

  <p>To get away, the idea possessed all his being.</p>

  <p>From the crest of the downs a sweet voice floated after his retreating
  form and never overtook him.</p>

  <p>"Di&mdash;ick!"</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 13</h3>

  <p class="first">Then presently Miss Philips arose to her feet, gathered her
skirts in her
  hand, and with her delicious chin raised and an expression of countenance
  that was almost business-like, descended towards the gathering audience
  below. She wore wide flowing skirts and came down the hill in Artemisian
  strides.</p>

  <p>It was high time that somebody looked at her.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5">V. &mdash; THE SEEKING OF BEALBY</a></h2>

  <h3>&sect; 1</h3>

  <p class="first">ON the same Monday evening that witnessed Bealby's first
experience of the
  theatre, Mr. Mergleson, the house steward of Shonts, walked slowly and
  thoughtfully across the corner of the park between the laundry and the
  gardens. His face was much recovered from the accidents of his collision with
  the Lord Chancellor, resort to raw meat in the kitchen had checked the
  development of his injuries, and only a few contusions in the side of his
  face were more than faintly traceable. And suffering had on the whole rather
  ennobled than depressed his bearing. He had a black eye, but it was not, he
  felt, a common black eye. It came from high quarters and through no fault of
  Mr. Mergleson's own. He carried it well. It was a fruit of duty rather than
  the outcome of wanton pleasure-seeking or misdirected passion.</p>

  <p>He found Mr. Darling in profound meditation over some peach trees against
  the wall. They were not doing so well as they ought to do, and Mr. Darling
  was engaged in wondering why.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mr. Darling," said Mr. Mergleson.</p>

  <p>Mr. Darling ceased rather slowly to wonder and turned to his friend. "Good
  evening, Mr. Mergleson," he said. "I don't quite like the look of these here
  peaches. Mowed if I do."</p>

  <p>Mr, Mergleson glanced at the peaches and then came to the matter that was
  nearest his heart.</p>

  <p>"You 'aven't I suppose seen anything of your stepson these last two days,
  Mr. Darling?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally not," said Mr. Darling, putting his head on one side and
  regarding his interlocutor. "Naturally not,&mdash;I've left that to you, Mr.
  Mergleson."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's what's awkward," said Mr. Mergleson, and then, with a forced
  easiness, "You see, I ain't seen 'im either."</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"No. I lost sight of 'im "&mdash;Mr. Mergleson appeared to
  reflect&mdash;"late on Sattiday night."</p>

  <p>"'Ow's that, Mr. Mergleson?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mergleson considered the difficulties of lucid explanation. "We missed
  'im," said Mr. Mergleson, simply regarding the well-weeded garden path with a
  calculating expression and then lifting his eyes to Mr. Darling's with an air
  of great candour. "And we continue to miss him."</p>

  <p>"<i>Well</i>!" said Mr. Darling. "That's rum."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Mergleson.</p>

  <p>"It's decidedly rum," said Mr, Darling.</p>

  <p>"We thought 'e might be 'iding from 'is work. Or cut off 'ome."</p>

  <p>"You didn't send down to ask."</p>

  <p>"We was too busy with the week-end people. On the 'ole we thought if 'e
  <i>'ad</i> cut 'ome, on the 'ole 'e wasn't a very serious loss. 'E got in the
  way at times.... And there was one or two things 'appened... Now that they're
  all gone and 'e 'asn't turned up Well, I came down, Mr. Darling, to arst you.
  Where's 'e gone?"</p>

  <p>"'E ain't come 'ere," said Mr. Darling surveying the garden.</p>

  <p>"I 'arf expected 'e might and I 'arf expected 'e mightn't," said Mr.
  Mergleson with the air of one who had anticipated Mr. Darling's answer but
  hesitated to admit as much.</p>

  <p>The two gentlemen paused for some seconds and regarded each other
  searchingly. Where's 'e got to?" said Mr. Darling. Well," said Mr. Mergleson,
  putting his hands where the tails of his short jacket would have been if it
  hadn't been short and looking extraordinarily like a parrot in its more
  thoughtful moods, "to tell you the truth, Mr. Darling, I've 'ad a dream about
  'im&mdash;and it worries me. I got a sort of ideer of 'im as being in one of
  them secret passages. 'Iding away. There was a guest, well, I say it with all
  respec' but anyone might 'ave 'id from 'im.... S' morning soon as the
  week-end 'ad cleared up and gone 'ome, me and Thomas went through them
  passages as well as we could. Not a trace of 'im. But I still got that ideer.
  'E was a wriggling, climbing, enterprising sort of boy."</p>

  <p>"I've checked 'im for it once or twice," said Mr. Darling with the red
  light of fierce memories gleaming for a moment in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"'E might even," said Mr. Mergleson, "well, very likely 'ave got 'imself
  jammed in one of them secret passages...."</p>

  <p>"Jammed," repeated Mr. Darling.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;got 'imself somewhere where 'e can't get out. I've 'card tell
  there's walled-up dungeons."</p>

  <p>"They say," said Mr. Darling, "there's underground passages to the Abbey
  ruins&mdash; three good mile away."</p>

  <p>"Orkward," said Mr. Mergleson....</p>

  <p>"Drat 'is eyes!" said Mr. Darling, scratching his head. "What does 'e mean
  by it?"</p>

  <p>"We can't leave 'im there," said Mr. Mergleson.</p>

  <p>"I knowed a young devil once what crawled up a culvert," said Mr. Darling.
  "'Is father 'ad to dig 'im out like a fox.... Lord! 'ow 'e walloped 'im for
  it."</p>

  <p>"Mistake to 'ave a boy in so young," said Mr. Mergleson.</p>

  <p>"It's all very awkward," said Mr. Darling, surveying every aspect of the
  case. "You see 'Is mother sets a most estrordinary value on 'im. Most
  estrordinary."</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether she oughtn't to be told," said Mr, Mergleson. "I was
  thinking of that."</p>

  <p>Mr. Darling was not the sort of man to meet trouble half-way. He shook his
  head at that. "Not yet, Mr. Mergleson. I don't think yet. Not until
  everything's been tried. I don't think there's any need to give her needless
  distress,&mdash;none whatever. If you don't mind I think I'll come up to-
  night&mdash;nineish say&mdash; and 'ave a talk to you and Thomas about
  it&mdash;a quiet talk. Best to begin with a quiet talk. It's a dashed rum go,
  and me and you we got to think it out a bit."</p>

  <p>"That's what <i>I</i> think," said Mr. Mergleson with unconcealed relief
  at Mr. Darling' s friendliness. "That's exactly the light, Mr. Darling, in
  which it appears to me. Because you see&mdash; if 'e's all right and in the
  'ouse, why doesn't 'e</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 2</h3>

  <p class="first">In the pantry that evening the question of telling someone
was discussed
  further. It was discussed over a number of glasses of Mr. Mergleson's beer.
  For, following a sound tradition, Mr. Mergleson brewed at Shonts, and
  sometimes he brewed well and sometimes he brewed ill, and sometimes he brewed
  weak and sometimes he brewed strong, and there was no monotony in the cups at
  Shonts. This was sturdy stuff and suited Mr. Darling's mood, and ever and
  again with an author's natural weakness and an affectation of abstraction Mr.
  Mergleson took the jug out empty and brought it back foaming.</p>

  <p>Henry, the second footman, was disposed to a forced hopefulness so as not
  to spoil the evening, but Thomas was sympathetic and distressed. The
  red-haired youth made cigarettes with a little machine, licked them and
  offered them to the others, saying little, as became him. Etiquette deprived
  him of an uninvited beer, and Mr. Mergleson's inattention completed what
  etiquette began.</p>

  <p>"I can't bear to think of the poor little beggar, stuck head foremost into
  some cobwebby cranny, blowed if I can," said Thomas, getting help from the
  jug.</p>

  <p>"He was an interesting kid," said Thomas in a tone that was frankly
  obituary. "He didn't like his work, one could see that, but he was
  lively&mdash;and I tried to help him along all I could, when I wasn't too
  busy myself."</p>

  <p>"There was something sensitive about him," said Thomas.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mergleson sat with his arms loosely thrown out over the table.</p>

  <p>"What we got to do is to tell someone," he said, "I don't see 'ow I can
  put off telling 'er ladyship&mdash;after to-morrow morning. And then
  &mdash;'eaven 'elp us!"</p>

  <p>"Course I got to tell my missis," said Mr. Darling, and poured in a
  preoccupied way, some running over.</p>

  <p>"We'll go through them passages again now before we go to bed," said Mr.
  Mergleson, "far as we can. But there's 'oles and chinks on'y a boy could get
  through."</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> got to tell the missis," said Mr. Darling. "That's what's
  worrying me...."</p>

  <p>As the evening wore on there was a tendency on the part of Mr. DarIng to
  make this the refrain of his discourse. He sought advice. "'Ow'd you tell the
  missis?" he asked Mr. Mergleson, and emptied a glass to control his
  impatience before Mr. Mergleson replied.</p>

  <p>"I shall tell 'er ladyship, just simply, the fact. I shall say, 'Your
  ladyship, here's my boy gone and we don't know where.' And as she arsts me
  questions so shall I give particulars."</p>

  <p>Mr. Darling reflected and then shook his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"'Ow'd <i>ju</i> tell the missis?" he asked Thomas.</p>

  <p>"Glad I haven't got to," said Thomas. "Poor little beggar!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but 'ow would you tell 'er?" Mr. Darling said, varying the accent
  very carefully.</p>

  <p>"I'd go to 'er and I'd pat her back and I'd say 'Bear up,' see, and when
  she asked what for, I'd just tell her what for&mdash;gradual like."</p>

  <p>"You don't know the missis," said Mr. Darling. "Henry, 'ow'd <i>ju</i>
  tell 'er?"</p>

  <p>"Let 'er find out," said Henry. "Wimmin do."</p>

  <p>Mr. Darling reflected, and decided that too was unworkable.</p>

  <p>"'Ow'd you?" he asked with an air of desperation of the red-haired
  youth.</p>

  <p>The red-haired youth remained for a moment with his tongue extended,
  licking the gum of a cigarette paper, and his eyes on Mr. Darling. Then he
  finished the cigarette slowly, giving his mind very carefully to the question
  he had been honoured with. "I think," he said, in a low serious voice, "I
  should say, just simply, 'Mary' &mdash;or 'Susan'&mdash;or whatever her name
  is."</p>

  <p>"Tilda," supplied Mr. Darling.</p>

  <p>"'Tilda,' I should say, 'The Lord gave and the Lord 'ath taken away.
  Tilda!&mdash;'e's gone.' Somethin' like that."</p>

  <p>The red-haired boy cleared his throat. He was rather touched by his own
  simple eloquence.</p>

  <p>Mr. Darling reflected on this with profound satisfaction for some moments.
  Then he broke out almost querulously, "Yes, but brast him!&mdash; Where's 'e
  gone?"</p>

  <p>"Anyhow," said Mr. Darling, "I ain't going to tell 'er not till the
  morning. I ain't going to lose my night's rest if I 'ave lost my stepson.
  Nohow. Mr. Mergleson, I must say, I don't think I ever 'ave tasted better
  beer. Never. It's&mdash;it's famous beer."</p>

  <p>He had some more....</p>

  <p>On his way back through the moonlight to the gardens Mr. Darling was still
  unsettled as to the exact way of breaking things to his wife. He had come out
  from the house a little ruffled because of Mr. Mergleson's opposition to a
  rather good idea of his that he should go about the house and " holler for
  'im a bit. He'd know my voice you see. Ladyship wouldn't mind. Very likely
  'sleep by now." But the moonlight dispelled his irritation.</p>

  <p>How was he to tell his wife? He tried various methods to the listening
  moon.</p>

  <p>There was for example the offhand newsy way. "You know tha' boy yours?"
  Then a pause for the reply. Then, "'E's toley dis'peared."</p>

  <p>Only there are difficulties about the word totally.</p>

  <p>Or the distressed impersonal manner. "Dre'fle thing happen'd. Dre'fle
  thing. Tha' poo' lill' chap, Artie&mdash;toley dis'peared."</p>

  <p>Totally again.</p>

  <p>Or the personal intimate note. "Dunno wha' you'll say t'me, Tilda, when
  you hear whattogottasay. Thur'ly bad news. Seems they los' our Artie up
  there&mdash;clean los' 'im. Can't fine 'im nowhere 'tall."</p>

  <p>Or the authoritative kindly. "Tilda&mdash;you go' control yourself. Go'
  show whadyou made of. Our boy&mdash;'e's&mdash;hic&mdash;<i>los</i>'."</p>

  <p>Then he addressed the park at large with a sudden despair. "Don' care wha'
  I say, she'll blame it on to me. I know 'er!"</p>

  <p>After that the enormous pathos of the situation got hold of him. "Poor
  lill' chap," he said. "Poor lill' fell'," and shed a few natural tears.</p>

  <p>"Loved 'im jessis mione son."</p>

  <p>As the circumambient night made no reply he repeated the remark in a
  louder, almost domineering tone....</p>

  <p>He spent some time trying to climb the garden wall because the door did
  not seem to be in the usual place. (Have to inquire about that in the
  morning. Difficult to see everything is all right when one is so bereaved.)
  But finally he came on the door round a corner.</p>

  <p>He told his wife merely that he intended to have a peaceful night, and
  took off his boots in a defiant and intermittent manner.</p>

  <p>The morning would be soon enough.</p>

  <p>She looked at him pretty hard, and he looked at her ever and again, but
  she never made a guess at it.</p>

  <p>Bed.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 3</h3>

  <p class="first">So soon as the week-enders had dispersed and Sir Peter had
gone off to
  London to attend to various matters affecting the peptonizing of milk and the
  distribution of baby soothers about the habitable globe, Lady Laxton went
  back to bed and remained in bed until midday on Tuesday. Nothing short of
  complete rest and the utmost kindness from her maid would, she felt, save her
  from a nervous breakdown of the most serious description. The festival had
  been stormy to the end. Sir Peter's ill-advised attempts to deprive Lord
  Moggeridge of alcohol had led to a painful struggle at lunch, and this had
  been followed by a still more unpleasant scene between host and guest in the
  afternoon. "This is an occasion for tact," Sir Peter had said, and had gone
  off to tackle the Lord Chancellor, leaving his wife to the direst, best
  founded apprehensions. For Sir Peter's tact was a thing by itself, a mixture
  of misconception, recrimination and familiarity that was rarely well
  received....</p>

  <p>She had had to explain to the Sunday dinner party that his lordship had
  been called away suddenly. "Something connected with the Great Seal," Lady
  Laxton had whispered in a discreet mysterious whisper. One or two simple
  hearers were left with the persuasion that the Great Seal had been taken
  suddenly unwell&mdash; and probably in a slightly indelicate manner. Thomas
  had to paint Mergleson's eye with grease-paint left over from some private
  theatricals. It had been a patched-up affair altogether, and before she
  retired to bed that night Lady Laxton had given way to her accumulated
  tensions and wept.</p>

  <p>There was no reason whatever why to wind up the day Sir Peter should have
  stayed in her room for an hour saying what he thought of Lord Moggeridge. She
  felt she knew quite well enough what he thought of Lord Moggeridge, and on
  these occasions he always used a number of words that she did her best to
  believe, as a delicately brought-up woman, were unfamiliar to her
  ears....</p>

  <p>So on Monday, as soon as the guests had gone, she went to bed again and
  stayed there, trying as a good woman should to prevent herself thinking of
  what the neighbours could be thinking&mdash;and saying&mdash;of the whole
  affair, by studying a new and very circumstantial pamphlet by Bishop Fowle on
  social evils, turning over the moving illustrations of some recent
  antivivisection literature and re-reading the accounts in the morning papers
  of a colliery disaster in the north of England.</p>

  <p>To such women as Lady Laxton, brought up in an atmosphere of refinement
  that is almost colourless and living a life troubled only by small social
  conflicts and the minor violence of Sir Peter, blameless to the point of
  complete uneventfulness, and secure and comfortable to the point of tedium,
  there is something amounting to fascination in the wickedness and sufferings
  of more normally situated people, there is a real attraction and solace in
  the thought of pain and stress, and as her access to any other accounts of
  vice and suffering was restricted she kept herself closely in touch with the
  more explicit literature of the various movements for human moralization that
  distinguish our age, and responded eagerly and generously to such painful
  catastrophes as enliven it. The counterfoils of her cheque-book witnessed to
  her gratitude for these vicarious sensations. She figured herself to herself
  in her day dreams as a calm and white and shining intervention checking and
  reproving amusements of an undesirable nature, and earning the tearful
  blessings of the mangled bye-products of industrial enterprise.</p>

  <p>There is a curious craving for entire reality in the feminine composition,
  and there were times when in spite of these feasts of particulars, she wished
  she could come just a little nearer to the heady dreadfulnesses of life than
  simply writing a cheque against it. She would have liked to have actually
  seen the votaries of evil blench and repent before her contributions, to have
  herself unstrapped and revived and pitied some doomed and chloroformed victim
  of the so-called "scientist," to have herself participated in the stretcher
  and the hospital and humanity made marvellous by enlistment under the
  red-cross badge. But Sir Peter's ideals of womanhood were higher than his
  language, and he would not let her soil her refinement with any vision of the
  pain and evil in the world. "Sort of woman they want up there is a Trained
  Nurse," he used to say when she broached the possibility of going to some
  famine or disaster. "You don't want to go prying, old girl...."</p>

  <p>She suffered, she felt, from repressed heroism. If ever she was to shine
  in disaster that disaster, she felt, must come to her, she might not go to
  meet it, and so you realize how deeply it stirred her, how it brightened her
  and uplifted her to learn from Mr. Mergleson's halting statements that
  perhaps, that probably, that almost certainly, a painful and tragical thing
  was happening even now within the walls of Shonts, that there was urgent
  necessity for action&mdash;if anguish was to be witnessed before it had ended
  and life saved.</p>

  <p>She clasped her hands; she surveyed her large servitor with agonized
  green-grey eyes.</p>

  <p>"Something must be done at once," she said. "Everything possible must be
  done. Poor little Mite!"</p>

  <p>"Of course, my lady, 'e may 'ave run away!" "Oh no!" she cried, "he hasn't
  run away. He hasn't run away. How can you be so wicked, Mergleson? Of course
  he hasn't run away. He's there now. And it's too dreadful." She became
  suddenly very firm and masterful. The morning's colliery tragedy inspired her
  imagination.</p>

  <p>"We must get pick-axes," she said. "We must organize search parties. Not a
  moment is to be lost, Mergleson&mdash;not a moment.... Get the men in off the
  roads. Get everyone you can...."</p>

  <p>And not a moment was lost. The road men were actually at work in Shonts
  before their proper dinner-hour was over.</p>

  <p>They did quite a lot of things that afternoon. Every passage attainable
  from the dining-room opening was explored, and where these passages gave ok
  chinks and crannies they were opened up with a vigour which Lady Laxton had
  greatly stimulated by an encouraging presence and liberal doses of whisky.
  Through their efforts a fine new opening was made into the library from the
  wall near the window, a hole big enough for a man to fall through, because
  one did, and a great piece of stonework was thrown down from the Queen
  Elizabeth tower exposing the upper portion of the secret passage to the light
  of day. Lady Laxton herself and the head housemaid went round the panelling
  with a hammer and a chisel, and called out "Are you there?" and attempted an
  opening wherever it sounded hollow. The sweep was sent for to go up the old
  chimneys outside the present flues. Meanwhile Mr. Darling had been set with
  several of his men to dig for, discover, pick up and lay open the underground
  passage or disused drain, whichever it was, that was known to run from the
  corner of the laundry towards the old ice-house, and that was supposed to
  reach to the Abbey ruins. After some bold exploratory excavations this
  channel was located and a report sent at once to Lady Laxton.</p>

  <p>It was this and the new and alarming scar on the Queen Elizabeth tower
  that brought Mr. Beaulieu Plummer post-haste from the estate office up to the
  house. Mr. Beaulieu Plummer was the Marquis of Cranberry's estate agent, a
  man of great natural tact, and charged among other duties with the task of
  seeing that the Laxtons did not make away with Shonts during the period of
  their tenancy. He was a sound compact little man, rarely out of extremely
  riding breeches and gaiters, and he wore glasses, that now glittered with
  astonishment as he approached Lady Laxton and her band of spade workers.</p>

  <p>At his approach Mr. Darling attempted to become invisible, but he was
  unable to do so.</p>

  <p>"Lady Laxton," Mr. Beaulieu Plummer appealed, "may I ask?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Beaulieu Plummer, I'm so glad you've come. A little
  boy&mdash;suffocating! I can hardly hear it."</p>

  <p>"Suffocating!" cried Mr. Beaulieu Plummer, "where?" and was in a confused
  manner told.</p>

  <p>He asked a number of questions that Lady Laxton found very tiresome. But
  how did she know the boy was in the secret passages? Of course she knew; was
  it likely she would do all this if she didn't know? But mightn't he have run
  away? How could he when he was in the secret passages? But why not first
  scour the countryside? By which time he would be smothered and starved
  and</p>

  <p>They parted with a mutual loss of esteem, and Mr. Beaulieu Plummer,
  looking very serious indeed, ran as fast as he could straight to the village
  telegraph-office. Or to be more exact he walked until he thought himself out
  of sight of Lady Laxton and then he took to his heels and ran. He sat for
  some time in the parlour post-office spoiling telegraph forms, and composing
  telegrams to Sir Peter Laxton and Lord Cranberry.</p>

  <p>He got these off at last, and then drawn by an irresistible fascination
  went back to the park and watched from afar the signs of fresh activities on
  the part of Lady Laxton.</p>

  <p>He saw men coming from the direction of the stables with large rakes. With
  these they dragged the ornamental waters.</p>

  <p>Then a man with a pick-axe appeared against the skyline and crossed the
  roof in the direction of the clock tower, bound upon some unknown but
  probably highly destructive mission.</p>

  <p>Then he saw Lady Laxton going off to the gardens. She was going to console
  Mrs. Darling in her trouble. This she did through nearly an hour and a half.
  And on the whole it seemed well to Mr. Beaulieu Plummer that so she should be
  occupied....</p>

  <p>It was striking five when a telegraph boy on a bicycle came up from the
  village with a telegram from Sir Peter Laxton.</p>

  <p>"Stop all proceedings absolutely," it said, "until I get to you."</p>

  <p>Lady Laxton's lips tightened at the message. She was back from much
  weeping with Mrs. Darling and altogether finely strung. Here she felt was one
  of those supreme occasions when a woman must assert herself. "A matter of
  life or death," she wired in reply, and to show herself how completely she
  overrode such dictation as this, she sent Mr. Mergleson down to the village
  public-house with orders to engage anyone he could find there for an
  evening's work on an extraordinarily liberal overtime scale.</p>

  <p>After taking this step the spirit of Lady Laxton quailed. She went and sat
  in her own room and quivered. She quivered but she clenched her delicate
  fist.</p>

  <p>She would go through with it, come what might, she would go on with the
  excavation all night if necessary, but at the same time she began a little to
  regret that she had not taken earlier steps to demonstrate the improbability
  of Bealby having simply run away. She set to work to repair this omission.
  She wrote off to the Superintendent of Police in the neighbouring town, to
  the nearest magistrate, and then on the off-chance to various of her week-end
  guests, including Captain Douglas. If it was true that he had organized the
  annoyance of the Lord Chancellor (and though she still rejected that view she
  did now begin to regard it as a permissible hypothesis), then he might also
  know something about the mystery of this boy's disappearance.</p>

  <p>Each letter she wrote she wrote with greater fatigue and haste than its
  predecessor and more illegibly.</p>

  <p>Sir Peter arrived long after dark. He cut across the corner of the park to
  save time, and fell into one of the trenches that Mr. Darling had opened.
  This added greatly to the eclat with which he came into the hall.</p>

  <p>Lady Laxton withstood him for five minutes and then returned abruptly to
  her bedroom and locked herself in, leaving the control of the operations in
  his hands....</p>

  <p>"If he's not in the house," said Sir Peter, "all this is thunderin'
  foolery, and if he's in the house he's dead. If he's dead he'll smell in a
  bit and then'll be the time to look for him. Somethin' to go upon instead of
  all this blind hacking the place about. No wonder they're threatenin'
  proceedings...."</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 4</h3>

  <p class="first">Upon Captain Douglas Lady Laxton's letter was destined to
have a very
  distracting effect. Because as he came to think it over, as he came to put
  her partly illegible allusions to secret passages and a missing boy side by
  side with his memories of Lord Moggeridge's accusations and the general
  mystery of his expulsion from Shonts, it became more and more evident to him
  that he had here something remarkably like a clue, something that might serve
  to lift the black suspicion of irreverence and levity from his military
  reputation. And he had already got to the point of suggesting to Miss Philips
  that he ought to follow up and secure Bealby forthwith, before ever they came
  over the hill crest to witness the disaster to the caravan.</p>

  <p>Captain Douglas, it must be understood, was a young man at war within
  himself.</p>

  <p>He had been very nicely brought up, firstly in a charming English home,
  then in a preparatory school for selected young gentlemen, then in a good set
  at Eton, then at Sandhurst, where the internal trouble had begun to manifest
  itself. Afterwards the Bistershires.</p>

  <p>There were three main strands in the composition of Captain Douglas. In
  the first place and what was peculiarly his own quality was the keenest
  interest in the why of things and the how of things and the general mechanism
  of things. He was fond of clocks, curious about engines, eager for science;
  he had a quick brain and nimble hands. He read Jules Verne and liked to think
  about going to the stars and making flying machines and submarines&mdash; in
  those days when everybody knew quite certainly that such things were
  impossible. His brain teemed with larval ideas that only needed air and light
  to become active fullfledged ideas. There he excelled most of us. In the next
  place, but this second strand was just a strand that most young men have, he
  had a natural keen interest in the other half of humanity, he thought them
  lovely, interesting, wonderful, and they filled him with warm curiosities and
  set his imagination cutting the prettiest capers. And in the third place and
  there again he was ordinarily human, he wanted to be liked, admired,
  approved, well thought of.... And so constituted he had passed through the
  educational influence of that English home, that preparatory school, the good
  set at Eton, the Sandhurst discipline, the Bistershire mess....</p>

  <p>Now the educational influence of the English home, the preparatory school,
  the good set at Eton and Sandhurst in those days&mdash;though Sandhurst has
  altered a little since&mdash;was all to develop that third chief strand of
  his being to the complete suppression of the others, to make him look well
  and unobtrusive, dress well and unobtrusively, behave well and unobtrusively,
  carry himself well, play games reasonably well, do nothing else well, and in
  the best possible form. And the two brothers Douglas, who were both really
  very much alike, did honestly do their best to be such plain and simple
  gentlemen as our country demands, taking pretentious established things
  seriously, and not being odd or intelligent&mdash;in spite of those insurgent
  strands.</p>

  <p>But the strands were in them. Below the surface the disturbing impulses
  worked and at last forced their way out....</p>

  <p>In one Captain Douglas, as Mrs. Rampound Pilby told the Lord Chancellor,
  the suppressed ingenuity broke out in disconcerting mystifications and
  practical jokes that led to a severance from Portsmouth, in the other the
  pent-up passions came out before the other ingredients in an uncontrollable
  devotion to the obvious and challenging femininity of Miss Madeleine
  Philips.... His training had made him proof against ordinary women, deaf as
  it were to their charms, but she&mdash;she had penetrated. And impulsive
  forces that have been pent up go with a bang when they go....</p>

  <p>The first strand in the composition of Captain Douglas has still to be
  accounted for, the sinister strain of intelligence and inventiveness and
  lively curiosity. On that he had kept a warier hold. So far that had not been
  noted against him. He had his motor bicycle it is true at a time when motor
  bicycles were on the verge of the caddish; to that extent a watchful eye
  might have found him suspicious; that was all that showed. I wish I could add
  it was all that there was, but other things&mdash;other things were going on.
  Nobody knew about them. But they were going on more and more.</p>

  <p>He read books.</p>

  <p>Not decent fiction, not official biographies about other fellows' fathers
  and all the old anecdotes brought up to date and so on, but books with
  ideas,&mdash;you know, philosophy, social philosophy, scientific stuff, all
  that rot. The sort of stuff they read in mechanics' institutes.</p>

  <p>He thought. He could have controlled it. But he did not attempt to control
  it. He tried to think. He knew perfectly well that it wasn't good form, but a
  vicious attraction drew him on.</p>

  <p>He used to sit in his bedroom-study at Sandhurst, with the door locked,
  and write down on a bit of paper what he really believed and why. He would
  cut all sorts of things to do this. He would question things no properly
  trained English gentleman ever questions.</p>

  <p>And&mdash;he experimented.</p>

  <p>This you know was long before the French and American aviators. It was
  long before the coming of that emphatic lead from abroad without which no
  well-bred English mind permits itself to stir. In the darkest secrecy he
  used to make little models of cane and paper and elastic in the hope that
  somehow he would find out something about flying. Flying &mdash;that dream!
  He used to go off by himself to lonely places and climb up as high as he
  could and send these things fluttering earthward. He used to moon over them
  and muse about them. If anyone came upon him suddenly while he was doing
  these things, he would sit on his model, or pretend it didn't belong to him
  or clap it into his pocket, whichever was most convenient, and assume the
  vacuous expression of a well-bred gentleman at leisure &mdash;and so far
  nobody had caught him. But it was a dangerous practice.</p>

  <p>And finally, and this now is the worst and last thing to tell of his
  eccentricities, he was keenly interested in the science of his profession and
  intensely ambitious.</p>

  <p>He thought&mdash;though it wasn't his business to think, the business of a
  junior officer is to obey and look a credit to his regiment&mdash;that the
  military science of the British army was not nearly so bright as it ought to
  be, and that if big trouble came there might be considerable scope for an
  inventive man who had done what he could to keep abreast with foreign work,
  and a considerable weeding out of generals whose promotion had been
  determined entirely by their seniority, amiability and unruffled connubial
  felicity. He thought that the field artillery would be found out&mdash;there
  was no good in making a fuss about it beforehand&mdash; that no end of
  neglected dodges would have to be picked up from the enemy, that the
  transport was feeble, and a health service&mdash;other than surgery and
  ambulance&mdash;an unknown idea; but he saw no remedy but experience. So he
  worked hard in secret; he worked almost as hard as some confounded foreigner
  might have done; in the belief that after the first horrid smash-up there
  might be a chance to do things.</p>

  <p>Outwardly of course he was sedulously all right. But he could not quite
  hide the stir in his mind. It broke out upon his surface in a chattering
  activity of incompleted sentences which he tried to keep as decently silly as
  he could. He had done his utmost hitherto to escape the observation of the
  powers that were. His infatuation for Madeleine Philips had at any rate
  distracted censorious attention from these deeper infamies....</p>

  <p>And now here was a crisis in his fife. Through some idiotic entanglement
  manifestly connected with this missing boy, he had got tarred by his
  brother's brush and was under grave suspicion for liveliness and
  disrespect.</p>

  <p>The thing might be his professional ruin. And he loved the suppressed
  possibilities of his work beyond measure.</p>

  <p>It was a thing to make him absent-minded even in the company of
  Madeleine.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 5</h3>

  <p class="first">Not only were the first and second strands in the
composition of Captain
  Douglas in conflict with all his appearances and pretensions, but they were
  also in conflict with one another.</p>

  <p>He was full of that concealed resolve to do and serve and accomplish great
  things in the world. That was surely purpose enough to hide behind an
  easy-going unpretending gentlemanliness. But he was also tremendously
  attracted by Madeleine Philips, more particularly when she was not there.</p>

  <p>A beautiful woman may be the inspiration of a great career. This however
  he was beginning to find was not the case with himself. He had believed it at
  first and written as much and said as much, and said it very variously and
  gracefully. But becoming more and more distinctly clear to his intelligence
  was the fact that the very reverse was the case. Miss Madeleine Philips was
  making it very manifest to Captain Douglas that she herself was a career;
  that a lover with any other career in view need not&mdash;as the
  advertisements say&mdash; apply.</p>

  <p>And the time she took up!</p>

  <p>The distress of being with her!</p>

  <p>And the distress of not being with her!</p>

  <p>She was such a proud and lovely and entrancing and distressing being to
  remember, and such a vain and difficult thing to be with.</p>

  <p>She knew clearly that she was made for love, for she had made herself for
  love, and she went through life like its empress with all mankind and
  numerous women at her feet. And she had an ideal of the lover who should win
  her which was like an oleographic copy of a Laszlo portrait of Douglas
  greatly magnified. He was to rise rapidly to great things, he was to be a
  conqueror and administrator, while attending exclusively to her. And
  incidentally she would gather desperate homage from ail other men of mark,
  and these attentions would be an added glory to her love for him. At first
  Captain Douglas had been quite prepared to satisfy all these requirements. He
  had met her at Shorncliffe, for her people were quite good military people,
  and he had worshipped his way straight to her feet. He had made the most
  delightfully simple and delicate love to her. He had given up his secret vice
  of thinking for the writing of quite surprisingly clever love-letters, and
  the little white paper models had ceased for a time to flutter in lonely
  places. And then the thought of his career returned to him, from a new
  aspect, as something he might lay at her feet. And once it had returned to
  him it remained with him.</p>

  <p>"Some day," he said, "and it may not be so very long, some of those
  scientific chaps will invent flying. Then the army will have to take it up,
  you know."</p>

  <p>"I should love," she said, "to soar through the air."</p>

  <p>He talked one day of going on active service. How would it affect them if
  he had to do so? It was a necessary part of a soldier's lot.</p>

  <p>"But I should come too!" she said. "I should come with you."</p>

  <p>"It might not be altogether convenient," he said, for already he had
  learnt that Madeleine Philips usually travelled with quite a large number of
  trunks and considerable impressiveness.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she said, "it would be splendid! How could I let you go
  alone? You would be the great general and I should be with you always."</p>

  <p>"Not always very comfortable," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Silly boy!&mdash;I shouldn't mind that! How little you know me! Any
  hardship!"</p>

  <p>"A woman&mdash;if she isn't a nurse "</p>

  <p>"I should come dressed as a man. I would be your groom...."</p>

  <p>He tried to think of her dressed as a man, but nothing on earth could get
  his imagination any further than a vision of her dressed as a Principal Boy.
  She was so delightfully and valiantly not virile; her hair would have flowed,
  her body would have moved, a richly fluent femininity&mdash;visible through
  any disguise.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 6</h3>

  <p class="first">That was in the opening stage of the controversy between
their careers. In
  those days they were both acutely in love with each other. Their friends
  thought the spectacle quite beautiful; they went together so well. Admirers,
  fluttered with the pride of participation, asked them for week-ends together;
  those theatrical week-ends that begin on Sunday morning and end on Monday
  afternoon. She confided widely.</p>

  <p>And when at last there was something like a rupture it became the concern
  of a large circle of friends.</p>

  <p>The particulars of the breach were differently stated. It would seem that
  looking ahead he had announced his intention of seeing the French army
  manoeuvres just when it seemed probable that she would be out of an
  engagement.</p>

  <p>"But I ought to see what they are doing," he said. "They're going to try
  those new dirigibles."</p>

  <p>Then should she come?</p>

  <p>He wanted to whisk about. It wouldn't be any fun for her. They might get
  landed at nightfall in any old hole. And besides people would talk Especially
  as it was in France. One could do unconventional things in England one
  couldn't in France. Atmosphere was different.</p>

  <p>For a time after that halting explanation she maintained a silence. Then
  she spoke in a voice of deep feeling. She perceived, she said, that he wanted
  his freedom. She would be the last person to hold a reluctant lover to her
  side. He might go&mdash;to any manoeuvres. He might go if he wished round the
  world. He might go away from her for ever. She would not detain him, cripple
  him, hamper a career she had once been assured she inspired....</p>

  <p>The unfortunate man torn between his love and his profession protested
  that he hadn't meant that.</p>

  <p>Then what had he meant?</p>

  <p>He realized he had meant something remarkably like it, and he found great
  difficulty in expressing these fine distinctions....</p>

  <p>She banished him from her presence for a month, said he might go to his
  manoeuvres&mdash; with her blessing. As for herself, that was her own affair.
  Some day perhaps he might know more of the heart of a woman.... She choked
  back tears&mdash;very beautifully, and military science suddenly became a
  trivial matter. But she was firm. He wanted to go. He must go. For a month
  anyhow.</p>

  <p>He went sadly....</p>

  <p>Into this opening breach rushed friends. It was the inestimable triumph of
  Judy Bowles to get there first. To begin with Madeleine confided in her and
  then, availing herself of the privilege of a distant cousinship, she
  commanded Douglas to tea in her Knightsbridge flat and had a good straight
  talk with him. She liked good straight talks with honest young men about
  their love affairs; it was almost the only form of flirtation that the
  Professor, who was a fierce tough undiscriminating man upon the essentials of
  matrimony, permitted her. And there was something peculiarly gratifying about
  Douglas's complexion. Under her guidance he was induced to declare that he
  could not live without Madeleine, that her love was the heart of his life,
  without it he was nothing and with it he could conquer the world.... Judy
  permitted herself great protestations on behalf of Madeleine, and Douglas was
  worked up to the pitch of kissing her intervening hand. He had little silvery
  hairs, she saw, all over his temples. And he was such a simple perplexed
  dear. It was a rich beautiful afternoon for Judy.</p>

  <p>And then in a very obvious way Judy, who was already deeply in love with
  the idea of a caravan tour and the "wind on the heath" and the "Gipsy life"
  and the "open road" and all the rest of it, worked this charming little love
  difficulty into her scheme, utilized her reluctant husband to arrange for the
  coming of Douglas, confided in Mrs. Geedge....</p>

  <p>And Douglas went off with his perplexities. He gave up all thought of
  France, week-ended at Shonts instead, to his own grave injury, returned to
  London unexpectedly by a Sunday train, packed for France and started. He
  reached Rheims on Monday afternoon. And then the image of Madeleine which
  always became more beautiful and mysterious and commanding with every mile he
  put between them would not let him go on. He made unconvincing excuses to the
  Daily Excess military expert with whom he was to have seen things&mdash;"
  There's a woman in it, my boy, and you're a fool to go," said the Daily
  Excess man, "but of course you'll go, and I for one don't blame you " He
  hurried back to London and was at Judy's trysting-place even as Judy had
  anticipated.</p>

  <p>And when he saw Madeleine standing in the sunlight, pleased and proud and
  glorious, with a smile in her eyes and trembling on her lips, with a strand
  or so of her beautiful hair and a streamer or so of delightful blue
  fluttering in the wind about her gracious form, it seemed to him for the
  moment that leaving the manoeuvres and coming back to England was quite a
  right and almost a magnificent thing to do.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 7</h3>

  <p class="first">This meeting was no exception to their other race
meetings.</p>

  <p>The coming to her was a crescendo of poetical desire, the sight of her a
  climax and then&mdash;an accumulation of irritations.</p>

  <p>He had thought being with her would be pure delight, and as they went over
  the down straying after the Bowles and the Geedges towards the Redlake Hotel
  he already found himself rather urgently asking her to marry him, and being
  annoyed by what he regarded as her evasiveness.</p>

  <p>He walked along with the restrained movement of a decent Englishman, he
  seemed as it were to gesticulate only through his clenched teeth, and she
  floated beside him, in a blue dress that with a wonderful foresight she had
  planned for breezy uplands on the basis of Botticelli's Primavera. He was
  urging her to marry him soon; he needed her, he could not live in peace
  without her. It was not at all what he had come to say; he could not
  recollect that he had come to say anything, but now that he was with her it
  was the only thing he could find to say to her.</p>

  <p>"But, my dearest boy," she said, "how are we to marry? What is to become
  of your career and my career?"</p>

  <p>"I've left my career!" cried Captain Douglas with the first clear note of
  irritation in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Oh! don't let us quarrel," she cried. "Don't let us talk of all those
  distant things. Let us be happy. Let us enjoy just this lovely day and the
  sunshine and the freshness and the beauty.... Because you know we are
  snatching these days. We have so few days together. Each&mdash;each must be a
  gem.... Look, dear, how the breeze sweeps through these tall dry stems that
  stick up everywhere &mdash;low broad ripples,"</p>

  <p>She was a perfect work of art, abolishing time and obligations.</p>

  <p>For a time they walked in silence. Then Captain Douglas said, "All very
  well&mdash;beauty and all that&mdash;but a fellow likes to know where he
  is."</p>

  <p>She did not answer immediately and then she said, "I believe you are angry
  because you have come away from France."</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," said the Captain stoutly. "I'd come away from anywhere
  to be with you."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," she said.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;haven't I?"</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you ever are with me.... Oh!&mdash;I know you want me. I know
  you desire me. But the real thing, the happiness,&mdash;love. What is
  anything to love&mdash;anything at all?"</p>

  <p>In this strain they continued until their footsteps led them through the
  shelter of a group of beeches. And there the gallant Captain sought
  expression in deeds. He kissed her hands, he sought her lips. She resisted
  softly.</p>

  <p>"No," she said, "only if you love me with all your heart."</p>

  <p>Then suddenly, wonderfully, conqueringly she yielded him her lips.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she sighed presently, "if only you understood."</p>

  <p>And leaving speech at that enigma she kissed again....</p>

  <p>But you see now how difficult it was under these mystically loving
  conditions to introduce the idea of a prompt examination and dispatch of
  Bealby. Already these days were consecrated....</p>

  <p>And then you see Bealby vanished&mdash;going seaward....</p>

  <p>Even the crash of the caravan disaster did little to change the
  atmosphere. In spite of a certain energetic quality in the Professor's
  direction of the situation&mdash;he was a little embittered because his thumb
  was sprained and his knee bruised rather badly and he had a slight abrasion
  over one ear and William had bitten his calf&mdash;the general disposition
  was to treat the affair hilariously. Nobody seemed really hurt except
  William,&mdash;the Professor was not so much hurt as annoyed&mdash;and
  William's injuries though striking were all superficial, a sprained jaw and
  grazes and bruises and little things like that; everybody was heartened up to
  the idea of damages to be paid for; and neither the internal injuries to the
  caravan nor the hawker's estimate of his stock-in-trade proved to be as great
  as one might reasonably have expected. Before sunset the caravan was safely
  housed in the Winthorpe-Sutbury public-house, William had found a congenial
  corner in the bar parlour, where his account of an inside view of the
  catastrophe and his views upon Professor Bowles were much appreciated, the
  hawker had made a bit extra by carting all the luggage to the Redlake Royal
  Hotel, and the caravanners and their men-folk had loitered harmoniously back
  to this refuge. Madeleine had walked along the road beside Captain Douglas
  and his motor bicycle, which he had picked up at the now desolate
  encampment.</p>

  <p>"It only remains," she said, "for that thing to get broken."</p>

  <p>"But I may want it," he said.</p>

  <p>"No," she said, "Heaven has poured us together and now He has smashed the
  vessels. At least He has smashed one of the vessels. And look!&mdash;like a
  great shield, there is the moon. It's the Harvest Moon, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"No," said the Captain, with his poetry running away with him. "It's the
  Lovers' Moon."</p>

  <p>"It's like a benediction rising over our meeting."</p>

  <p>And it was certainly far too much like a benediction for the Captain to
  talk about Bealby.</p>

  <p>That night was a perfect night for lovers, a night flooded with a kindly
  radiance, so that the warm mystery of the centre of life seemed to lurk in
  every shadow, and hearts throbbed instead of beating and eyes were stars.
  After dinner everyone found wraps and slipped out into the moonlight; the
  Geedges vanished like moths; the Professor made no secret that Judy was
  transfigured for him. Night works these miracles. The only other visitors
  there, a brace of couples, resorted to the boats upon the little lake.</p>

  <p>Two enormous waiters removing the coffee cups from the small tables upon
  the veranda heard Madeleine's beautiful voice for a little while; and then it
  was stilled....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 8</h3>

  <p class="first">The morning found Captain Douglas in a state of reaction.
He was anxious
  to explain quite clearly to Madeleine how necessary it was that, he should go
  in search of Bealby forthwith. He was beginning to realize now just what a
  chance in the form of Bealby had slipped through his fingers. He had dropped
  Bealby, and now the thing to do was to pick up Bealby again before he was
  altogether lost. Her professional life unfortunately had given Miss Philips
  the habit of never rising before midday, and the Captain had to pass the time
  as well as he could until the opportunity for his explanaation came.</p>

  <p>A fellow couldn't go off without an explanation....</p>

  <p>He passed the time with Professor Bowles upon the golf-links.</p>

  <p>The Professor was a first-rate player and an unselfish one; he wanted all
  other players to be as good as himself. He would spare no pains to make them
  so. If he saw them committing any of the many errors into which golfers fall
  he would tell them of it and tell them why it was an error, and insist upon
  showing them just how to avoid it in future. He would point out any want of
  judgment, and not confine himself as so many professional golf teachers do
  merely to the stroke. After a time he found it necessary to hint to the
  Captain that nowadays a military man must accustom himself to self-control.
  The Captain kept Pishing and Tushing and presently it was only too evident
  swearing softly; his play got jerky, his strokes were forcible without any
  real strength, once he missed the globe altogether and several times he
  sliced badly. The eyes under his light eyelashes were wicked little
  things.</p>

  <p>He remembered that he had always detested golf.</p>

  <p>And the Professor. He had always detested the Professor.</p>

  <p>And his caddie; at least he would have always detested his caddie if he
  had known him long enough. His caddie was one of those maddening boys with no
  expression at all. It didn't matter what he did or failed to do, there was
  the silly idiot with his stuffed face, unmoved.</p>

  <p>Really of course overjoyed&mdash;but apparently unmoved....</p>

  <p>"Why did I play it that way?" the Captain repeated. "Oh! because I like to
  play it that way."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the Professor. "It isn't a recognized way anyhow...."</p>

  <p>Then came a moment of evil pleasure.</p>

  <p>He sliced. Old Bowles sliced. For once in a while he'd muffed something.
  Always teaching others and here he was slicing! Why, sometimes the Captain
  didn't slice!....</p>

  <p>He'd get out of that neatly enough. Luck! He'd get the hole yet. What a
  bore it all was!....</p>

  <p>Why couldn't Madeleine get up at a decent hour to see a fellow? Why must
  she lie in bed when she wasn't acting? If she had got up all this wouldn't
  have happened. The shame of it! Here he was, an able-bodied capable man in
  the prime of life and the morning of a day playing this blockhead's game!</p>

  <p>Yes&mdash;blockhead's game!</p>

  <p>"You play the Ike," said the Professor.</p>

  <p>"Rather," said the Captain and addressed himself to his stroke.</p>

  <p>"That's not your ball," said the Professor. Similar position," said the
  Captain. You know, you might win this hole," said the Professor.</p>

  <p>Who cares?" said the Captain under his breath and putted
  extravagantly.</p>

  <p>"That saves me," said the Professor and went down from a distance of
  twelve yards.</p>

  <p>The Captain, full of an irrational resentment, did his best to halve the
  hole and failed.</p>

  <p>"You ought to put in a week at nothing but putting," said the Professor.
  "It would save you at least a stroke a hole. I've noticed that on almost
  every green, if I haven't beaten you before I pull up in the putting."</p>

  <p>The Captain pretended not to hear and said a lot of rococo things inside
  himself.</p>

  <p>It was Madeleine who had got him in for this game. A beautiful healthy
  girl ought to get up in the mornings. Mornings and beautiful healthy girls
  are all the same thing really. She ought to be dewy&mdash;positively dewy....
  There she must be lying, warm and beautiful in bed&mdash; like Catherine the
  Great or somebody of that sort. No. It wasn't right. All very luxurious and
  so on but not right. She ought to have understood that he was bound to fall a
  prey to the Professor if she didn't get up. Golf! Here he was, neglecting his
  career; hanging about on these beastly links, all the sound men away there in
  France&mdash;it didn't do to think of it!&mdash;and he was playing this
  retired tradesman's consolation!</p>

  <p>(Beastly the Professor's legs looked from behind. The uglier a man's legs
  are the better he plays golf. It's almost a law.)</p>

  <p>That's what it was, a retired tradesman's consolation. A decent British
  soldier has no more business to be playing golf than he has to be dressing
  dolls. It's a game at once worthless and exasperating. If a man isn't
  perfectly fit he cannot play golf, and when he is perfectly fit he ought to
  be doing a man's work in the world. If ever anything deserved the name of
  vice, if ever anything was pure, unforgivable dissipation, surely golf was
  that thing....</p>

  <p>And meanwhile that boy was getting more and more start. Anyone with a
  ha'porth of sense would have been up at five and after that brat&mdash; might
  have had him bagged and safe and back to lunch. Ass one was at times!</p>

  <p>"You're here, sir," said the caddie.</p>

  <p>The Captain perceived he was in a nasty place, open green ahead but with
  some tumbled country near at hand and to the left, a rusty old gravel pit,
  furze at the sides, water at the bottom. Nasty attractive hole of a place.
  Sort of thing one gets into. He must pull himself together for this. After
  all, having undertaken to play a game one must play the game. If he hit the
  infernal thing, that is to say the ball, if he hit the ball so that if it
  didn't go straight it would go to the right rather&mdash; clear of the hedge
  it wouldn't be so bad to the right. Difficult to manage. Best thing was to
  think hard of the green ahead, a long way ahead,&mdash;with just the
  slightest deflection to the right. Now then,&mdash;heels well down, club up,
  a good swing, keep your eye on the ball, keep your eye on the ball, keep your
  eye on the ball just where you mean to hit it&mdash;far below there and a
  little to the right&mdash;and don't worry....</p>

  <p>Rap.</p>

  <p>"In the pond I think, sir."</p>

  <p>"The water would have splashed if it had gone in the pond," said the
  Professor. "It must be over there in the wet sand. You hit it pretty hard, I
  thought."</p>

  <p>Search. The caddie looked as though he didn't care whether he found it or
  not. He ought to be interested. It was his profession, not just his game. But
  nowadays everybody had this horrid disposition towards slacking. A Tired
  generation we are. The world is too much with us. Too much to think about,
  too much to do, Madeleines, army manoeuvres, angry lawyers, lost
  boys&mdash;let alone such exhausting foolery as this game....</p>

  <p>"Got it, sir!" said the caddie.</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"Here, sir! Up in the bush, sir!"</p>

  <p>It was resting in the branches of a bush two yards above the slippery
  bank.</p>

  <p>"I doubt if you can play it," said the Professor, "but it will be
  interesting to try."</p>

  <p>The Captain scrutinized the position. "I can play it," he said.</p>

  <p>"You'll slip, I'm afraid," said the Professor.</p>

  <p>They were both right. Captain Douglas drove his feet into the steep slope
  of rusty sand below the bush, held his iron a little short and wiped the ball
  up and over and as he found afterwards out of the rough. All eyes followed
  the ball except his. The Professor made sounds of friendly encouragement. But
  the Captain was going&mdash;going. He was on all fours, he scrabbled handfuls
  of prickly gorse, of wet sand. His feet, his ankles, his calves slid into the
  pond. How much more? No. He'd reached the bottom. He proceeded to get out
  again as well as he could. Not so easy. The bottom of this pond sucked at
  him....</p>

  <p>When at last he rejoined the other three his hands were sandy red, his
  knees were sandy red, his feet were of clay, but his face was like the face
  of a little child. Like the face of a little fair child after it has been
  boiled red in its bath and then dusted over with white powder. His ears were
  the colour of roses, Lancaster roses. And his eyes too had something of the
  angry wonder of a little child distressed....</p>

  <p>"I was afraid you'd slip into the pond," said the Professor,</p>

  <p>"I didn't," said the Captain.</p>

  <p>"I just got in to see how deep it was and cool my feet&mdash;I hate warm
  feet."</p>

  <p>He lost that hole but he felt a better golfer now, his anger he thought
  was warming him up so that he would presently begin to make strokes by
  instinct and do remarkable things unawares. After all there is something in
  the phrase " getting one's blood up." If only the Professor wouldn't dally so
  with his ball and let one's blood get down again. Tap!&mdash;the Professor's
  ball went soaring. Now for it. The Captain addressed himself to his task,
  altered his plans rather hastily, smote and topped the ball.</p>

  <p>The least one could expect was a sympathetic silence. But the Professor
  thought fit to improve the occasion.</p>

  <p>"You'll never drive," said the Professor, "you'll never drive with that
  irritable jerk in the middle of the stroke. You might just as well smack the
  ball without raising your club. If you think "</p>

  <p>The Captain lost his self-control altogether.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "if you think that I care a single rap about how I
  hit the ball, if you think that I really want to win and do well at this
  beastly silly elderly childish game "</p>

  <p>He paused on the verge of ungentlemanly language.</p>

  <p>"If a thing's worth doing at all," said the Professor after a pause for
  reflection, "it's worth doing well,"</p>

  <p>"Then it isn't worth doing at all. As this hole gives you the game&mdash;-
  if you don't mind "</p>

  <p>The Captain's hot moods were so rapid that already he was acutely ashamed
  of himself.</p>

  <p>"Oh certainly if you wish it," said the Professor.</p>

  <p>With a gesture the Professor indicated the altered situation to the
  respectful caddies, and the two gentlemen turned their faces towards the
  hotel.</p>

  <p>For a time they walked side by side in silence, the caddies following with
  hushed expressions.</p>

  <p>"Splendid weather for the French manoeuvres," said the Captain presently
  in an offhand tone, "that is to say if they are getting this weather."</p>

  <p>"At present there are a series of high-pressure systems over the whole of
  Europe north of the Alps," said the Professor. "It is as near set fair as
  Europe can be."</p>

  <p>"Fine weather for tramps and wanderers," said the Captain after a further
  interval.</p>

  <p>"There's a drawback to everything," said the Professor. "But it's very
  lovely weather."</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 9</h3>

  <p class="first">They got back to the hotel about half-past eleven and the
Captain went and
  had an unpleasant time with one of the tyres of his motor bicycle which had
  got down in the night. In replacing the tyre he pinched the top of one of his
  fingers rather badly. Then he got the ordnance map of the district and sat at
  a green table in the open air in front of the hotel windows and speculated on
  the probable flight of Bealby. He had been last seen going south by east.
  That way lay the sea, and all boy fugitives go naturally for the sea.</p>

  <p>He tried to throw himself into the fugitive's mind and work out just
  exactly the course Bealby must take to the sea.</p>

  <p>For a time he found this quite an absorbing occupation.</p>

  <p>Bealby probably had no money or very little money. Therefore he would have
  to beg or steal. He wouldn't go to the workhouse because he wouldn't know
  about the workhouse, respectable poor people never know anything about the
  workhouse, and the chances were he would be both too honest and too timid to
  steal. He'd beg. He'd beg at front doors because of dogs and things and he'd
  probably go along a high road. He'd be more likely to beg from houses than
  from passers-by because a door is at first glance less formidable than a
  pedestrian and more accustomed to being addressed. And he'd try isolated
  cottages rather than the village street doors, an isolated wayside cottage is
  so much more confidential. He'd ask for food&mdash;not money. All that seemed
  pretty sound.</p>

  <p>Now this road on the map&mdash;into it he was bound to fall and along it
  he would go begging. No other?... No.</p>

  <p>In the fine weather he'd sleep out. And he'd go&mdash;ten, twelve,
  fourteen&mdash;thirteen, thirteen miles a day.</p>

  <p>So now, he ought to be about here. And to-night,&mdash;here.</p>

  <p>To-morrow at the same pace,&mdash;here.</p>

  <p>But suppose he got a lift!....</p>

  <p>He'd only get a slow lift if he got one at all. It wouldn't make much
  difference in the calculation....</p>

  <p>So if to-morrow one started and went on to these cross roads marked Inn,
  just about twenty-six miles it must be by the scale, and beat round it one
  ought to get something in the way of tidings of Mr. Bealby. Was there any
  reason why Bealby shouldn't go on south by east and seaward?....</p>

  <p>None.</p>

  <p>And now there remained nothing to do but to explain all this clearly to
  Madeleine. And why didn't she come down? Why didn't she come down?</p>

  <p>But when one got Bealby what would one do with him?</p>

  <p>Wring the truth out of him&mdash;half by threats and half by persuasion.
  Suppose after all he hadn't any connexion with the upsetting of Lord
  Moggeridge? He had. Suppose he hadn't. He had. He had. He had.</p>

  <p>And when one had the truth?</p>

  <p>Whisk the boy right up to London and confront the Lord Chancellor with the
  facts. But suppose he wouldn't be confronted with the facts. He was a touchy
  old sinner....</p>

  <p>For a time Captain Douglas baulked at this difficulty. Then suddenly there
  came into his head the tall figure, the long moustaches of that kindly
  popular figure, his adopted uncle Lord Chickney. Suppose he took the boy
  straight to Uncle Chickney, told him the whole story. Even the Lord
  Chancellor would scarcely refuse ten minutes to General Lord Chickney....</p>

  <p>The clearer the plans of Captain Douglas grew the more anxious he became
  to put them before Madeleine&mdash;clearly and convincingly....</p>

  <p>Because first he had to catch his boy....</p>

  <p>Presently as Captain Douglas fretted at the continued eclipse of
  Madeleine, his thumb went into his waistcoat pocket and found a piece of
  paper. He drew it out and looked at it. It was a little piece of stiff
  note-paper cut into the shape of a curved V rather after the fashion of a
  soaring bird. It must have been there for months. He looked at it. His
  care-wrinkled brow relaxed. He glanced over his shoulder at the house and
  then held this little scrap high over his head and let go. It descended with
  a slanting flight curving round to the left, and then came about and swept
  down to the ground to the right.... Now why did it go like that? As if it
  changed its mind. He tried it again. Same result.... Suppose the curvature of
  the wings was a little greater? Would it make a more acute or a less acute
  angle? He did not know.... Try it.</p>

  <p>He felt in his pocket for a piece of paper, found Lady Laxton's letter,
  produced a stout pair of nail scissors in a sheath from his waistcoat pocket,
  selected a good clear sheet, and set himself to cut out his improved
  V....</p>

  <p>As he did so his eyes were on V number one, on the ground. It would be
  interesting to see if this thing turned about to the left again. If in fact
  it would go on zig-zagging. It ought he felt to do so. But to test that one
  ought to release it from some higher point so as to give it a longer flight.
  Stand on the chair?....</p>

  <p>Not in front of the whole rotten hotel. And there was a beastly looking
  man in a green apron coming out of the house,&mdash;the sort of man who looks
  at you. He might come up and watch; these fellows are equal to anything of
  that sort. Captain Douglas replaced his scissors and scraps in his pockets,
  leaned back with an affectation of boredom, got up, lit a
  cigarette&mdash;sort of thing the man in the green apron would think all
  right&mdash;and strolled off towards a clump of beech trees, beyond which
  were bushes and a depression. There perhaps one might be free from
  observation. Just try these things for a bit. That point about the angle was
  a curious one; it made one feel one's ignorance not to know that....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 10</h3>

  <p class="first">The ideal King has a careworn look, he rules, he has to do
things, but the
  ideal Queen is radiant happiness, tall and sweetly dignified, simply she has
  to be things. And when at last towards midday Queen Madeleine dispelled the
  clouds of the morning and came shining back into the world that waited
  outside her door, she was full of thankfulness for herself and for the empire
  that was given her. She knew she was a delicious and wonderful thing, she
  knew she was well done, her hands, the soft folds of her dress as she held it
  up, the sweep of her hair from her forehead pleased her, she lifted her chin
  but not too high for the almost unenvious homage in the eyes of the housemaid
  on the staircase. Her descent was well timed for the lunch gathering of the
  hotel guests; there was "Ah I&mdash;here she comes at last!" and there was
  her own particular court out upon the verandah before the entrance, Geedge
  and the Professor and Mrs. Bowles&mdash; and Mrs. Geedge coming across the
  lawn,&mdash;and the lover?</p>

  <p>She came on down and out into the sunshine. She betrayed no surprise. The
  others met her with flattering greetings that she returned smilingly. But the
  lover?</p>

  <p>He was not there!</p>

  <p>It was as if the curtain had gone up on almost empty stalls.</p>

  <p>He ought to have been worked up and waiting tremendously. He ought to have
  spent the morning in writing a poem to her or in writing a delightful
  poetical love-letter she could carry away and read, or in wandering alone and
  thinking about her. He ought to be feeling now like the end of a vigil. He
  ought to be standing now, a little in the background and with that pleasant
  flush of his upon his face and that shy, subdued, reluctant look that was so
  infinitely more flattering than any boldness of admiration. And then she
  would go towards him, for she was a giving type, and hold out both hands to
  him, and he, as though he couldn't help it, in spite of all his British
  reserve, would take one and hesitate&mdash;which made it all the more
  marked&mdash; and kiss it....</p>

  <p>Instead of which he was just not there.... No visible disappointment
  dashed her bravery. She knew that at the slightest flicker Judy and Mrs.
  Geedge would guess and that anyhow the men would guess nothing. "I've
  rested," she said, "I've rested delightfully. What have you all been
  doing?"</p>

  <p>Judy told of great conversations, Mr. Geedge had been looking for trout in
  the stream, Mrs. Geedge with a thin little smile said she had been making a
  few notes and&mdash;she added the word with deliberation&mdash;"
  observations," and Professor Bowles said he had had a round of golf with the
  Captain. "And he lost?" asked Madeleine.</p>

  <p>"He's careless in his drive and impatient at the greens," said the
  Professor modestly.</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"He vanished," said the Professor, recognizing the true orientation of her
  interest.</p>

  <p>There was a little pause and Mrs. Geedge said, "You know " and stopped
  short.</p>

  <p>Interrogative looks focused upon her.</p>

  <p>"It's so odd," she said.</p>

  <p>Curiosity increased.</p>

  <p>"I suppose one ought not to say," said Mrs. Geedge, "and yet&mdash;why
  shouldn't one?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Professor Bowles and everyone drew a little nearer to Mrs.
  Geedge.</p>

  <p>"One can't help being amused," she said.</p>

  <p>It was so&mdash;extraordinary."</p>

  <p>Is it something about the Captain?" asked Madeleine.</p>

  <p>Yes. You see,&mdash;he didn't see me." Is he&mdash;is he writing poetry?"
  Madeleine was much entertained and relieved at the thought. That would
  account for everything. The poor dear! He hadn't been able to find some
  rhyme!</p>

  <p>But one gathered from the mysterious airs of Mrs. Geedge that he was not
  writing poetry. "You see," she said, "I was lying out there among the bushes,
  just jotting down a few little things,&mdash;and he came by. And he went down
  into the hollow out of sight.... And what do you think he is doing? You'd
  never guess? He's been at it for twenty minutes."</p>

  <p>They didn't guess.</p>

  <p>"He's playing with little bits of paper&mdash; oh! like a kitten plays
  with dead leaves. He throws them up&mdash;and they flutter to the
  ground&mdash;and then he pounces on them."</p>

  <p>"But " said Madeleine. And then very brightly, "Let's go and see!"</p>

  <p>She was amazed. She couldn't understand. She hid it under a light
  playfulness, that threatened to become distraught. Even when presently, after
  a very careful stalking of the dell under the guidance of Mrs. Geedge, with
  the others in support, she came in sight of him, she still found him
  incredible. There was her lover, her devoted lover, standing on the top bar
  of a fence, his legs wide apart and his body balanced with difficulty, and in
  his fingers poised high was a little scrap of paper. This was the man who
  should have been waiting in the hall with feverish anxiety. His fingers
  released the little model and down it went drifting....</p>

  <p>He seemed to be thinking of nothing else in the world. She might never
  have been born!....</p>

  <p>Some noise, some rustle, caught his ear. He turned his head quickly,
  guiltily, and saw her and her companions.</p>

  <p>And then he crowned her astonishment. No love-light leapt to his eyes; he
  uttered no cry of joy. Instead he clutched wildly at the air, shouted, "Oh
  damn!" and came down with a complicated inelegance on all fours upon the
  ground.</p>

  <p>He was angry with her&mdash;angry; she could see that he was extremely
  angry.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 11</h3>

  <p class="first">So it was that the incompatibilities of man and woman arose
again in the
  just recovering love-dream of Madeleine Philips. But now the discord was far
  more evident than it had been at the first breach.</p>

  <p>Suddenly her dear lover, her flatterer, her worshipper, had become a
  strange averted man. He scrabbled up two of his paper scraps before he came
  towards her, still with no love-light in his eyes. He kissed her hand as if
  it was a matter of course and said almost immediately: "I've been hoping for
  you all the endless morning. I've had to amuse myself as best I can."</p>

  <p>His tone was resentful. He spoke as if he had a claim upon her, upon her
  attentions. As if it wasn't entirely upon his side that obligations lay.</p>

  <p>She resolved that shouldn't deter her from being charming.</p>

  <p>And all through the lunch she was as charming as she could be, and under
  such treatment that rebellious ruffled quality vanished from his manner,
  vanished so completely that she could wonder if it had really been evident at
  any time. The alert servitor returned.</p>

  <p>She was only too pleased to forget the disappointment of her descent and
  forgive him, and it was with a puzzled incredulity that she presently saw his
  "difficult " expression returning. It was an odd little knitting of the
  brows, a faint absent-mindedness, a filming of the brightness of his worship.
  He was just perceptibly indifferent to the charmed and charming things he was
  saying.</p>

  <p>It seemed best to her to open the question herself. "Is there something on
  your mind, Dot?"</p>

  <p>"Dot " was his old school nickname.</p>

  <p>"Well no&mdash;not exactly on my mind. But</p>

  <p>It's a bother of course. There's that confounded boy...."</p>

  <p>"Were you trying some sort of divination about him? With those pieces of
  paper?"</p>

  <p>"No. That was different. That was&mdash;just</p>

  <p>something else. But you see that boy</p>

  <p>Probably clear up the whole of the Moggeridge bother&mdash;and you know it
  is a bother. Might turn out beastly awkward...."</p>

  <p>It was extraordinarily difficult to express. He wanted so much to stay
  with her and he wanted so much to go.</p>

  <p>But all reason, all that was expressible, all that found vent in words and
  definite suggestions was on the side of an immediate pursuit of Bealby. So
  that it seemed to her he wanted and intended to go much more definitely than
  he actually did.</p>

  <p>That divergence of purpose flawed a beautiful afternoon, cast chill
  shadows of silences over their talk, arrested endearments. She was irritated.
  About six o'clock she urged him to go; she did not mind, anyhow she had
  things to see to, letters to write, and she left him with an effect of
  leaving him for ever. He went and overhauled his motor bicycle thoroughly,
  and then an aching dread of separation from her arrested him.</p>

  <p>Dinner, the late June sunset and the moon seemed to bring them together
  again. Almost harmoniously he was able to suggest that he should get up very
  early the next morning, pursue and capture Bealby and return for lunch.</p>

  <p>"You'd get up at dawn!" she cried. "But how perfectly Splendid the
  midsummer dawn must be."</p>

  <p>Then she had an inspiration. "Dot!" she cried, "I will get up at dawn also
  and come with you.... Yes, but as you say he cannot be more than thirteen
  miles away we'd catch him warm in his little bed somewhere. And the
  freshness! The dewy freshness!"</p>

  <p>And she laughed her beautiful laugh and said it would be " Such Fun!"
  entering as she supposed into his secret desires and making the most perfect
  of reconciliations. They were to have tea first, which she would prepare with
  the caravan lamp and kettle. Mrs. Geedge would hand it over to her.</p>

  <p>She broke into song. "A Hunting we will go&mdash;ooh," she sang. "A
  Hunting we will go...."</p>

  <p>But she could not conquer the churlish underside of the Captain's nature
  even by such efforts. She threw a glamour of vigour and fun over the
  adventure, but some cold streak in his composition was insisting all the time
  that as a boy hunt the attempt failed. Various little delays in her
  preparations prevented a start before half-past seven, he let that weigh with
  him, and when sometimes she clapped her hands and ran&mdash;and she ran like
  a deer, and sometimes she sang, he said something about going at an even
  pace.</p>

  <p>At a quarter-past one Mrs. Geedge observed them returning. They were
  walking abreast and about six feet apart, they bore themselves grimly after
  the manner of those who have delivered ultimata and they conversed no
  more....</p>

  <p>In the afternoon Madeleine kept her own room exhausted, and Captain
  Douglas sought opportunities of speaking to her in vain. His face expressed
  distress and perplexity, with momentary lapses into wrathful resolution, and
  he evaded Judy and her leading questions and talked about the weather with
  Geedge. He declined a proposal of the Professor's to go round the links, with
  especial reference to his neglected putting. "You ought to, you know," said
  the Professor.</p>

  <p>About half-past three and without any publication of his intention.
  Captain Douglas departed upon his motor bicycle....</p>

  <p>Madeleine did not reappear until dinner-time, and then she was clad in
  lace and gaiety that impressed the naturally very good observation of Mrs.
  Geedge as unreal.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 12</h3>

  <p class="first">The Captain, a confusion of motives that was as it were a
mind returning
  to chaos, started upon his motor bicycle. He had seen tears in her eyes. Just
  for one instant, but certainly they were tears. Tears of vexation. Or sorrow?
  (Which is the worse thing for a lover to arouse, grief or resentment?) But
  this boy must be caught, because if he was not caught a perpetually
  developing story of imbecile practical joking upon eminent and influential
  persons would eat like a cancer into the Captain's career. And if his career
  was spoilt what sort of thing would he be as a lover? Not to mention that he
  might never get a chance then to try flying for military purposes.... So
  anyhow, anyhow this boy must be caught. But quickly, for women's hearts are
  tender, they will not stand exposure to hardship. There is a kind of
  unreasonableness natural to goddesses. Unhappily this was an expedition
  needing wariness, deliberation, and one brought to it a feverish hurry to get
  back. There must be self-control There must be patience. Such occasions try
  the soldierly quality of a man....</p>

  <p>It added nothing to the Captain's self-control that after he had travelled
  ten miles he found he had forgotten his quite indispensable map and had to
  return for it. Then he was seized again with doubts about his inductions and
  went over them again, sitting by the roadside. (There must be patience.)...
  He went on at a pace of thirty-five miles an hour to the Inn he had marked
  upon his map as Bealby's limit for the second evening. It was a beastly
  little inn, it stewed tea for the Captain atrociously, and it knew nothing of
  Bealby. In the adjacent cottages also they had never heard of Bealby. Captain
  Douglas revised his deductions for the third time and came to the conclusion
  that he had not made a proper allowance for Wednesday afternoon. Then there
  was all Thursday, and the longer, lengthening part of Friday. He might have
  done thirty miles or more already. And he might have crossed this
  corner&mdash;inconspicuously.</p>

  <p>Suppose he hadn't after all come along this road!</p>

  <p>He had a momentary vision of Madeleine with eyes brightly tearful. "You
  left me for a Wild Goose Chase," he fancied her saying....</p>

  <p>One must stick to one's job. A soldier more particularly must stick to his
  job. Consider Balaclava....</p>

  <p>He decided to go on along this road and try the incidental cottages that
  his reasoning led him to suppose were the most likely places at which Bealby
  would ask for food. It was a business demanding patience and politeness.</p>

  <p>So a number of cottagers, for the greater part they were elderly women
  past the fiercer rush and hurry of life, grandmothers and ancient dames or
  wives at leisure with their children away at the Council schools, had a
  caller that afternoon. Cottages are such lonely places in the daytime that
  even district visitors and canvassers are godsends, and only tramps
  ill-received. Captain Douglas ranked high in the scale of visitors. There was
  something about him, his fairness, a certain handsomeness, his quick colour,
  his active speech, which interested women at all times, and now an
  indefinable flow of romantic excitement conveyed itself to his interlocutors.
  He encountered the utmost civility everywhere, doors at first tentatively
  ajar opened wider at the sight of him, and there was a kindly disposition to
  enter into his troubles lengthily and deliberately. They listened attentively
  to his demands, and before they testified to Bealby's sustained absence from
  their perception they would for the most part ask numerous questions in
  return. They wanted to hear the Captain's story, the reason for his research,
  the relationship between himself and the boy, they wanted to feel something
  of the sentiment of the thing. After that was the season for negative facts.
  Perhaps when everything was stated they might be able to conjure up what he
  wanted. He was asked in to have tea twice, for he looked not only pink and
  dusty but dry, and one old lady said that years ago she had lost just such a
  boy as Bealby seemed to be&mdash;" Ah! not in the way you have lost him
  "&mdash;and she wept, poor old dear! and was only comforted after she had
  told the Captain three touching but extremely lengthy and detailed anecdotes
  of Bealby's vanished prototype.</p>

  <p>(Fellow cannot rush away, you know; still all this sort of thing,
  accumulating, means a confounded lot of delay.)</p>

  <p>And then there was a deaf old man.... A very, very tiresome deaf old man
  who said at first he had seen Bealby....</p>

  <p>After all the old fellow was deaf....</p>

  <p>The sunset found the Captain on a breezy common forty miles away from the
  Redlake Royal Hotel and by this time he knew that fugitive boys cannot be
  trusted to follow the lines even of the soundest inductions. This business
  meant a search.</p>

  <p>Should he pelt back to Redlake and start again more thoroughly on the
  morrow?</p>

  <p>A moment of temptation.</p>

  <p>If he did he knew she wouldn't let him go.</p>

  <p>No!</p>

  <p>NO!</p>

  <p>He must make a sweeping movement through the country to the left, trying
  up and down the roads that, roughly speaking, radiated from Redlake between
  the twenty-fifth and the thirty-fifth milestone....</p>

  <p>It was night and high moonlight when at last the Captain reached
  Crayminster, that little old town decayed to a village, in the Crays valley.
  He was hungry, dispirited, quite unsuccessful and here he resolved to eat and
  rest for the night.</p>

  <p>He would have a meal, for by this time he was ravenous, and then go and
  talk in the bar or the tap about Bealby.</p>

  <p>Until he had eaten he felt he could not endure the sound of his own voice
  repeating what had already become a tiresome stereotyped formula: "You
  haven't I suppose seen or heard anything during the last two days of a small
  boy &mdash;little chap of about thirteen&mdash;wandering about? He's a sturdy
  resolute little fellow with a high colour, short wiry hair, rather
  dark...."</p>

  <p>The White Hart at Crayminster after some negotiations produced mutton
  cutlets and Austrahan hock. As he sat at his meal in the small ambiguous
  respectable dining-room of the inn&mdash;adorned with framed and glazed beer
  advertisements, crinkled paper fringes and insincere sporting prints&mdash;he
  became aware of a murmurous confabulation going on in the bar parlour. It
  must certainly, he felt, be the bar parlour....</p>

  <p>He could not hear distinctly, and yet it seemed to him that the
  conversational style of Crayminster was abnormally rich in expletive. And the
  tone was odd. It had a steadfast quality of commination.</p>

  <p>He brushed off a crumb from his jacket, lit a cigarette and stepped across
  the passage to put his hopeless questions.</p>

  <p>The talk ceased abruptly at his appearance.</p>

  <p>It was one of those deep-toned bar parlours that are so infinitely more
  pleasant to the eye than the tawdry decorations of the genteel accommodation.
  It was brown with a trimming of green paper hops and it had a mirror and
  glass shelves sustaining bottles and tankards. Six or seven individuals were
  sitting about the room. They had a numerous effect. There was a man in very
  light floury tweeds, with a floury bloom on his face and hair and an anxious
  depressed expression. He was clearly a baker. He sat forward as though he
  nursed something precious under the table. Next him was a
  respectable-looking, regular-featured, fair man with a large head, and a
  ruddy-faced butcher-like individual smoked a clay pipe by the side of the
  fireplace A further individual with an alert intrusive look might have been a
  grocer's assistant associating above himself.</p>

  <p>"Evening," said the Captain.</p>

  <p>"Evening," said the man with the large head guardedly.</p>

  <p>The Captain came to the hearthrug with an affectation of ease.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he began, "that you haven't any of you seen anything of a
  small boy, wandering about. He's a little chap about thirteen. Sturdy,
  resolute-looking little fellow with a high colour, short wiry hair, rather
  dark...."</p>

  <p>He stopped short arrested by the excited movements of the butcher's pipe
  and by the changed expressions of the rest of the company.</p>

  <p>"We&mdash;we seen 'im," the man with the big head managed to say at
  last.</p>

  <p>"We seen 'im all right," said a voice out of the darkness beyond the range
  of the lamp.</p>

  <p>The baker with the melancholy expression interjected, "I don't care if I
  don't ever see 'im again."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said the Captain, astonished to find himself suddenly beyond hoping
  on a hot fresh scent. "Now all that's very interesting. Where did you see
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Thunderin' vicious little varmint," said the butcher. "Owdacious."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Benshaw," said the voice from the shadows, "'E's arter 'im now with a
  shot gun loaded up wi' oats. 'E'll pepper 'im if 'e gets 'im, Bill will, you
  bet your 'at. And serve 'im jolly well right tew."</p>

  <p>"I doubt," said the baker, "I doubt if I'll ever get my stummik&mdash;not
  thoroughly proper again. It's a Blow I've 'ad. 'E give me a Blow. Oh! Mr.
  'Orrocks, could I trouble you for another thimbleful of brandy? Just a
  thimbleful neat. It eases the ache...."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6">VI. &mdash; BEALBY AND THE TRAMP</a></h2>

  <h3>&sect; 1</h3>

  <p class="first">BEALBY was loth to leave the caravan party even when by his
own gross
  negligence it had ceased to be a caravan party. He made off regretfully along
  the crest of the hills through bushes of yew and box until the clamour of the
  disaster was no longer in his ears. Then he halted for a time and stood
  sorrowing and listening, and then turned up by a fence along the border of a
  plantation and so came into a little overhung road.</p>

  <p>His ideas of his immediate future were vague in the extreme. He was a
  receptive expectation. Since his departure from the gardener's cottage
  circumstances had handed him on. They had been interesting but unstable
  circumstances. He supposed they would still hand him on. So far as he had any
  definite view about his intentions it was that he was running away to sea.
  And that he was getting hungry.</p>

  <p>It was also, he presently discovered, getting dark very gently and
  steadily. And the overhung road after some tortuosities expired suddenly upon
  the bosom of a great grey empty common with distant mysterious hedges.</p>

  <p>It seemed high time to Bealby that something happened of a comforting
  nature.</p>

  <p>Always hitherto something or someone had come to his help when the world
  grew dark and cold, and given him supper and put him or sent him to bed. Even
  when he had passed a night in the interstices of Shonts he had known there
  was a bed at quite a little distance under the stairs. If only that loud
  Voice hadn't shouted curses whenever he moved he would have gone to it. But
  as he went across this common in the gloaming it became apparent that this
  amiable routine was to be broken. For the first time he realized the world
  could be a homeless world.</p>

  <p>And it had become very still.</p>

  <p>Disagreeably still, and full of ambiguous shadows.</p>

  <p>That common was not only an unsheltered place, he felt, but an unfriendly
  place, and he hurried to a gate at the farther end. He kept glancing to the
  right and to the left. It would be pleasanter when he had got through that
  gate and shut it after him.</p>

  <p>In England there are no grey wolves.</p>

  <p>Yet at times one thinks of wolves, grey wolves, the colour of twilight and
  running noiselessly, almost noiselessly, at the side of their prey for quite
  a long time before they close in on it.</p>

  <p>In England, I say, there are no grey wolves.</p>

  <p>Wolves were extinguished in the reign of Edward the Third; it was in the
  histories, and since then no free wolf has trod the soil of England; only
  menagerie captives.</p>

  <p>Of course there may be escaped wolves!</p>

  <p>Now the gate!&mdash;sharp through it and slam it behind you, and a little
  brisk run and so into this plantation that slopes downhill. This is a sort of
  path, vague, but it must be a path. Let us hope it is a path.</p>

  <p>What was that among the trees?</p>

  <p>It stopped, surely it stopped, as Bealby stopped. Pump, pump Of course!
  that was one's heart.</p>

  <p>Nothing there! Just fancy. Wolves live in the open; they do not come into
  woods like this. And besides, there are no wolves. And if one
  shouts&mdash;even if it is but a phantom voice one produces, they go away.
  They are cowardly things&mdash;really. Such as there aren't. And there is the
  power of the human eye. Which is why they stalk you and watch you and evade
  you when you look, and creep and creep and creep behind you!</p>

  <p>Turn sharply.</p>

  <p>Nothing.</p>

  <p>How this stuff rustled under the feet! In woods at twilight, with
  innumerable things darting from trees and eyes watching you everywhere, it
  would be pleasanter if one could walk without making quite such a row.
  Presently surely, Bealby told himself, he would come out on a high road and
  meet other people and say "Good-night" as they passed. Jolly other people
  they would be, answering, "Goodnight." He was now going at a moistening trot.
  It was getting darker and he stumbled against things.</p>

  <p>When you tumble down wolves leap. Not of course that there are any
  wolves.</p>

  <p>It was stupid to keep thinking of wolves in this way. Think of something
  else. Think of things beginning with a B. Beautiful things, boys, beads,
  butterflies, bears. The mind stuck at bears. Are there such things as long
  grey hears? Ugh! Almost endless, noiseless bears?....</p>

  <p>It grew darker until at last the trees were black. The night was
  swallowing up the flying Bealby and he had a preposterous persuasion that it
  had teeth and would begin at the back of his legs....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 2</h3>

  <p class="first">"Hi!" cried Bealby weakly, hailing the glow of the fire out
of the
  darkness of the woods above.</p>

  <p>The man by the fire peered at the sound, he had been listening to the
  stumbling footsteps for some time, and he answered nothing.</p>

  <p>In another minute Bealby had struggled through the hedge into the visible
  world and stood regarding the man by the fire. The phantom wolves had fled
  beyond Sirius. But Bealby's face was pale still from the terrors of the
  pursuit and altogether he looked a smallish sort of small boy.</p>

  <p>"Lost?" said the man by the fire.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't find my way," said Bealby.</p>

  <p>"Anyone with you?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>The man reflected. "Tired?"</p>

  <p>"Bit."</p>

  <p>"Come and sit down by the fire and rest yourself."</p>

  <p>"I won't 'urt you," he added as Bealby hesitated.</p>

  <p>So far in his limited experience Bealby had never seen a human countenance
  lit from behind by a flickering red flame. The effect he found remarkable
  rather than pleasing. It gave him the most active and unstable countenance
  Bealby had ever seen. The nose seemed to be in active oscillation between Pug
  and Roman, the eyes jumped out of black caves and then went back into them,
  the more permanent features appeared to be a vast triangle of neck and chin.
  The tramp would have impressed Bealby as altogether inhuman if it had not
  been for the smell of cooking he diffused. There were onions in it and
  turnips and pepper&mdash; mouth-watering constituents, testimonials to
  virtue. He was making a stew in an old can that he had slung on a cross stick
  over a brisk fire of twigs that he was constantly replenishing.</p>

  <p>"I won't 'urt you, darn you," he repeated. "Come and sit down on these
  leaves here for a bit and tell me all abart it."</p>

  <p>Bealby did as he was desired. "I got lost," he said, feeling too exhausted
  to tell a good story.</p>

  <p>The tramp, examined more closely, became less pyrotechnic. He had a large
  loose mouth, a confused massive nose, much long fair hair, a broad chin with
  a promising beard and spots&mdash; a lot of spots. His eyes looked out of
  deep sockets and they were sharp little eyes. He was a lean man. His hands
  were large and long and they kept on with the feeding of the fire as he sat
  and talked to Bealby. Once or twice he leant forward and smelt the pot
  judiciously, but all the time the little eyes watched Bealby very
  closely.</p>

  <p>"Lose yer collar?" said the tramp.</p>

  <p>Bealby felt for his collar. "I took it orf," he said.</p>

  <p>"Come far?"</p>

  <p>"Over there," said Bealby.</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"Over there."</p>

  <p>"What place?"</p>

  <p>"Don't know the name of it."</p>

  <p>"Then it ain't your 'ome?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"You've run away," said the man.</p>

  <p>"P'raps I 'ave," said Bealby.</p>

  <p>"P'raps you 'ave! <i>Why</i> p'raps? You 'ave! What's the good of telling
  lies about it? When d'you start?"</p>

  <p>"Monday," said Bealby.</p>

  <p>The tramp reflected. "Had about enough of it?"</p>

  <p>"Dunno," said Bealby truthfully.</p>

  <p>"Like some soup?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"'Ow much?"</p>

  <p>"I could do with a lot," said Bealby.</p>

  <p>"Ah yah! I didn't mean that. I meant, 'ow much for some? 'Ow much will you
  pay for a nice, nice 'arf can of soup? I ain't a darn charity. See?"</p>

  <p>"Tuppence," said Bealby.</p>

  <p>The tramp shook his head slowly from side to side and took out the
  battered iron spoon he was using to stir the stuff and tasted the soup
  lusciously. It was&mdash;jolly good soup and there were potatoes in it.</p>

  <p>"Thrippence," said Bealby.</p>

  <p>"'Ow much you got?" asked the tramp.</p>

  <p>Bealby hesitated perceptibly. "Sixpence," he said weakly.</p>

  <p>"It's sixpence," said the tramp. "Pay up."</p>

  <p>"'Ow big a can?" asked Bealby.</p>

  <p>The tramp felt about in the darkness behind him and produced an empty can
  with a jagged mouth that had once contained, the label witnessed&mdash;I
  quote, I do not justify&mdash;'Deep Sea Salmon.' "That," he said, "and this
  chunk of bread.... Right enough?"</p>

  <p>"You will do it?" said Bealby.</p>

  <p>"Do I look a swindle?" cried the tramp, and suddenly a lump of the
  abundant hair fell over one eye in a singularly threatening manner. Bealby
  handed over the sixpence without further discussion. "I'll treat you fairly,
  you see," said the tramp, after he had spat on and pocketed the sixpence, and
  he did as much. He decided that the soup was ready to be served and he served
  it with care. Bealby began at once. "There's a nextry onion," said the tramp,
  throwing one over. "It didn't cost me much and I gives it you for nothin'.
  That's all right, eh? Here's 'ealth!"</p>

  <p>Bealby consumed his soup and bread meekly with one eye upon his host. He
  would, he decided, eat all he could and then sit a little while, and then get
  this tramp to tell him the way to&mdash;anywhere else. And the tramp wiped
  soup out of his can with gobbets of bread very earnestly and meditated sagely
  on Bealby.</p>

  <p>"You better pal in with me, matey, for a bit," he said at last. "You can't
  go nowhere else&mdash;not to-night."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't I walk perhaps to a town or sumpthing?"</p>

  <p>"These woods ain't safe."</p>

  <p>"'Ow d'you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Ever 'eard tell of a gurrillia?&mdash;sort of big black monkey
  thing."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Bealby faintly.</p>

  <p>"There's been one loose abat 'ere&mdash;oh week or more. Fact. And if you
  wasn't a grown up man quite and going along in the dark, well&mdash;'e might
  say something to you.... Of course 'e wouldn't do nothing where there was a
  fire or a man&mdash;but a little chap like you. I wouldn't like to let you do
  it, 'strewth I wouldn't. It's risky. Course I don't want to keep you.</p>

  <p>There it is. You go if you like. But I'd rather you didn't. 'Onest."</p>

  <p>"Where'd he come from?" asked Bealby.</p>

  <p>M'nagery," said the tramp.</p>

  <p>'E very near bit through the fist of a chap that tried to stop 'im," said
  the tramp.</p>

  <p>Bealby after weighing tramp and gorilla very carefully in his mind decided
  he wouldn't, and drew closer to the fire&mdash;but not too close&mdash; and
  the conversation deepened.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 3</h3>

  <p class="first">It was a long and rambling conversation and the tramp
displayed himself at
  times as quite an amiable person. It was a discourse varied by
  interrogations, and as a thread of departure and return it dealt with the
  life of the road and with life at large and&mdash;life, and with matters of "
  must " and " may."</p>

  <p>Sometimes and more particularly at first Bealby felt as though a ferocious
  beast lurked in the tramp and peeped out through the fallen hank of hair and
  might leap out upon him, and sometimes he felt the tramp was large and fine
  and gay and amusing, more particularly when he lifted his voice and his
  bristling chin. And ever and again the talker became a nasty creature and a
  disgusting creature, and his red-lit face was an ugly creeping approach that
  made Bealby recoil. And then again he was strong and wise. So the unstable
  needle of a boy's moral compass spins.</p>

  <p>The tramp used strange terms. He spoke of the "deputy" and the "doss-
  house," of the "spike" and "padding the hoof," of "screevers " and "tarts"
  and "copper's narks." To these words Bealby attached such meanings as he
  could, and so the things of which the tramp talked floated unsurely into his
  mind and again and again he had to readjust and revise his interpretations.
  And through these dim and fluctuating veils a new side of life dawned upon
  his consciousness, a side that was strange and lawless and dirty&mdash;in
  every way dirty&mdash; and dreadful and&mdash;attractive. That was the queer
  thing about it, that attraction. It had humour. For all its squalor and
  repulsiveness it was lit by defiance and laughter, bitter laughter perhaps
  but laughter. It had a gaiety that Mr. Mergleson for example did not possess,
  it had a penetration, like the penetrating quality of onions or acids or
  asafoetida, that made the memory of Mr. Darling insipid.</p>

  <p>The tramp assumed from the outset that Bealby had ' done something ' and
  run away, and some mysterious etiquette prevented his asking directly what
  was the nature of his offence. But he made a number of insidious soundings.
  And he assumed that Bealby was taking to the life of the road and that, until
  good cause to the contrary appeared, they were to remain together. "It's a
  tough life," he said, "but it has its points, and you got a toughish look
  about you."</p>

  <p>He talked of roads and the quality of roads and countryside. This was a
  good countryside; it wasn't overdone and there was no great hostility to
  wanderers and sleeping out. Some roads&mdash;the London to Brighton for
  example&mdash;if a chap struck a match somebody came running. But here unless
  you went pulling the haystacks about too much they left you alone. And they
  weren't such dead nuts on their pheasants, and one had a chance of an empty
  cowshed. "If I've spotted a shed or anything with a roof to it I stay out,"
  said the tramp, "even if it's raining cats and dogs. Otherwise it's the doss-
  'ouse or the 'spike.' It's the rain is the worst thing&mdash;getting wet. You
  haven't been wet yet, not if you only started Monday. Wet&mdash;with a chilly
  wind to drive it. Gaw! I been blown out of a holly hedge. You would think
  there'd be protection in a holly hedge...."</p>

  <p>"Spike's the last thing," said the tramp, "I'd rather go bare-gutted to a
  doss-'ouse anywhen. Gaw!&mdash;you've not 'ad your first taste of the spike
  yet."</p>

  <p>But it wasn't heaven in the doss-houses. He spoke of several of the
  landladies in strange but it would seem unflattering terms. "And there's
  always such a blamed lot of washing going on in a doss-'ouse. Always washing
  they are! One chap's washing 'is socks and another's washing 'is shirt.
  Making a steam drying it. Disgustin'. Carn't see what they want with it all.
  Band to git dirty again...."</p>

  <p>He discoursed of spikes, that is to say of workhouses, and of masters.
  "And then," he said with revolting yet alluring adjectives, "there's the
  bath."</p>

  <p>"That's the worst side of it," said the tramp.... "'Owever it doesn't
  always rain, and if it doesn't rain, well, you can keep yourself dry."</p>

  <p>He came back to the pleasanter aspects of the nomadic life. He was all for
  the outdoor style. "Ain't we comfortable 'ere?" he asked. He sketched out the
  simple larcenies that had contributed and given zest to the evening's meal.
  But it seemed there were also doss-houses that had the agreeable side. "Never
  been in one!" he said. "But where you been sleeping since Monday?"</p>

  <p>Bealby described the caravan in phrases that seemed suddenly thin and
  anaemic to his ears.</p>

  <p>"You hit it lucky," said the tramp. "If a chap's a kid he strikes all
  sorts of luck of that sort. Now ef <i>I</i> come up against three ladies
  travellin' in a van&mdash;think they'd arst me in? Not it!"</p>

  <p>He dwelt with manifest envy on the situation and the possibilities of the
  situation for some time. "You ain't dangerous," he said; "that's where you
  get in...."</p>

  <p>He consoled himself by anecdotes of remarkable good fortunes of a kindred
  description. Apparently he sometimes travelled in the company of a lady named
  Izzy Berners&mdash;" a fair scorcher, been a regular, slap-up circus
  actress." And there was also " good old Susan." It was a little difficult for
  Bealby to see the point of some of these flashes by a tendency on the part of
  the tramp while his thoughts turned on these matters to adopt a staccato
  style of speech, punctuated by brief, darkly significant guffaws. There grew
  in the mind of Bealby a vision of the doss-house as a large crowded place,
  lit by a great central fire, with much cooking afoot and much jawing and
  disputing going on, and then "me and Izzy sailed in...."</p>

  <p>The fire sank, the darkness of the woods seemed to creep nearer. The
  moonlight pierced the trees only in long beams that seemed to point
  steadfastly at unseen things, it made patches of ashen light that looked like
  watching faces. Under the tramp's direction Bealby skirmished round and got
  sticks and fed the fire until the darkness and thoughts of a possible gorilla
  were driven back for some yards and the tramp pronounced the blaze a " fair
  treat." He had made a kind of bed of leaves which he now invited Bealby to
  extend and share, and lying feet to the fire he continued his discourse.</p>

  <p>He talked of stealing and cheating by various endearing names; he made
  these enterprises seem adventurous and facetious; there was it seemed a
  peculiar sort of happy find one came upon called a " fiat," that it was not
  only entertaining but obligatory to swindle. He made fraud seem so smart and
  bright at times that Bealby found it difficult to keep a firm grasp on the
  fact that it was&mdash;fraud....</p>

  <p>Bealby lay upon the leaves close up to the prone body of the tramp, and
  his mind and his standards became confused. The tramp's body was a dark but
  protecting ridge on one side of him; he could not see the fire beyond his
  toes but its flickerings were reflected by the tree stems about them, and
  made perplexing sudden movements that at times caught his attention and made
  him raise his head to watch them.... Against the terrors of the night the
  tramp had become humanity, the species, the moral basis. His voice was full
  of consolation; his topics made one forget the watchful silent circumambient.
  Bealby's first distrusts faded. He began to think the tramp a fine,
  brotherly, generous fellow. He was also growing accustomed to a faint
  something&mdash;shall I call it an olfactory bar&mdash;that had hitherto kept
  them apart. The monologue ceased to devote itself to the elucidation of
  Bealby; the tramp was lying on his back with his fingers interlaced beneath
  his head and talking not so much to his companion as to the stars and the
  universe at large. His theme was no longer the wandering life simply but the
  wandering life as he had led it, and the spiritedness with which he had led
  it and the real and admirable quality of himself. It was that soliloquy of
  consolation which is the secret preservative of innumerable lives.</p>

  <p>He wanted to make it perfectly clear that he was a tramp by choice. He
  also wanted to make it clear that he was a tramp and no better because of the
  wicked folly of those he had trusted and the evil devices of enemies. In the
  world that contained those figures of spirit, Isopel Berners and Susan, there
  was also it seemed a bad and spiritless person, the tramp's wife, who had
  done him many passive injuries. It was clear she did not appreciate her
  blessings. She had been much to blame. "Anybody's opinion is better than 'er
  'usband's," said the tramp. "Always 'as been." Bealby had a sudden memory of
  Mr. Darling saying exactly the same thing of his mother. "She's the sort,"
  said the tramp, "what would rather go to a meetin' than a music 'all. She'd
  rather drop a shilling down a crack than spend it on anything decent. If
  there was a choice of jobs going she'd ask which 'ad the lowest pay and the
  longest hours and she'd choose that. She'd feel safer. She was born scared,
  When there wasn't anything else to do she'd stop at 'ome and scrub the
  floors. Gaw! it made a chap want to put the darn' pail over 'er 'ed, so's
  she'd get enough of it...."</p>

  <p>"I don't hold with all this crawling through life and saying Please," said
  the tramp. "I say it's my world just as much as it's your world. You may have
  your 'orses and carriages, your 'ouses and country places and all that, and
  you may think Gawd sent me to run abart and work for you; but <i>I</i> don't.
  See?"</p>

  <p>Bealby saw.</p>

  <p>"I seek my satisfactions just as you seek your satisfactions, and if you
  want to get me to work you've jolly well got to make me. I don't choose to
  work. I choose to keep on my own and a bit loose, and take my chance where I
  find it. You got to take your chances in this world. Sometimes they come bad
  and sometimes they come good. And very often you can't tell which it is when
  they 'ave come...."</p>

  <p>Then he fell questioning Bealby again and then he talked of the immediate
  future. He was beating for the seaside. "Always something doing," he said.
  "You got to keep your eye on for cops; those seaside benches, they're 'ot on
  tramps&mdash;give you a month for begging soon as look at you&mdash;but
  there's flats dropping sixpences thick as flies on a sore 'orse. You want a
  pal there for all sorts of jobs. You're just the chap for it, matey. Saw it
  soon's ever I set eyes on you. Then you can 'ave fun...."</p>

  <p>He made projects....</p>

  <p>Finally he became more personal and very flattering.</p>

  <p>"Now you and me," he said, suddenly shifting himself quite close to
  Bealby, "we're going to be downright pals. I've took a liking to you. Me and
  you are going to pal together. See?"</p>

  <p>He breathed into Bealby's face and laid a hand on his knee and squeezed
  it, and Bealby, on the whole, felt honoured by his protection....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 4</h3>

  <p class="first">In the unsympathetic light of a bright and pushful morning
the tramp was
  shorn of much of his overnight glamour. It became manifest that he was not
  merely offensively unshaven but extravagantly dirty. It was not ordinary
  rural dirt. During the last few days he must have had dealings of an intimate
  nature with coal. He was taciturn and irritable, he declared that this
  sleeping out would be the death of him, and the breakfast was only too
  manifestly wanting in the comforts of a refined home. He seemed a little less
  embittered after breakfast, he became even faintly genial, but he remained
  unpleasing. A distaste for the tramp arose in Bealby's mind, and as he walked
  on behind his guide and friend, he revolved schemes of unobtrusive
  detachment.</p>

  <p>Far be it from me to accuse Bealby of ingratitude. But it is true that
  that same disinclination which made him a disloyal assistant to Mr. Mergleson
  was now affecting his comradeship with the tramp. And he was deceitful. He
  allowed the tramp to build projects in the confidence of his continued
  adhesion, he did not warn him of the defection he meditated. But on the other
  hand Bealby had acquired from his mother an effective horror of stealing. And
  one must admit, since the tramp admitted it, that the man stole.</p>

  <p>And another little matter had at the same time estranged Bealby from the
  tramp and linked the two of them together. The attentive reader will know
  that Bealby had exactly two shillings and twopence-halfpenny when he came
  down out of the woods to the fireside. He had Mrs. Bowles' half-crown and the
  balance of Madeleine Philips' theatre shilling, minus six-pence-halfpenny for
  a collar and sixpence he had given the tramp for the soup overnight. But all
  this balance was now in the pocket of the tramp. Money talks and the tramp
  had heard it. He had not taken it away from Bealby, but he had obtained it in
  this manner: "We two are pals," he said, "and one of us had better be
  Treasurer. That's Me. I know the ropes better. So hand over what you got
  there, matey."</p>

  <p>And after he had pointed out that a refusal might lead to Bealby's
  evisceration the transfer occurred. Bealby v/as searched, kindly but
  firmly....</p>

  <p>It seemed to the tramp that this trouble had now blown over
  completely.</p>

  <p>Little did he suspect the rebellious and treacherous thoughts that seethed
  in the head of his companion. Little did he suppose that his personal
  appearance, his manners, his ethical flavour&mdash;nay, even his physical
  flavour &mdash;were being judged in a spirit entirely unamiable. It seemed to
  him that he had obtained youthful and subservient companionship,
  companionship that would be equally agreeable and useful; he had adopted a
  course that he imagined would cement the ties between them; he reckoned not
  with ingratitude. "If anyone arsts you who I am, call me uncle," he said.</p>

  <p>He walked along, a little in advance, sticking his toes out right and left
  in a peculiar wide pace that characterized his walk, and revolving schemes
  for the happiness and profit of the day. To begin with&mdash;great draughts
  of beer. Then tobacco. Later perhaps a little bread and cheese for Bealby.
  "You can't come in 'ere," he said at the first public-house. "You're under
  age, me boy. It ain't my doing, matey; it's 'Erbert Samuel. You blame 'im. 'E
  don't objec' to you going to work for any other Mr. Samuel there may 'appen
  to be abart or anything of that sort, that's good for you, that is; but 'e's
  most particular you shouldn't go into a public-'ouse. So you just wait about
  outside 'ere. <i>I'll</i> 'ave my eye on you."</p>

  <p>"You going to spend my money?" asked Bealby.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to ration the party," said the tramp.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you got no right to spend my money," said Bealby.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;'Ang it I&mdash;I'll get you some acid-drops," said the tramp in
  tones of remonstrance.</p>

  <p>"I tell you, blame you,&mdash;it's 'Erbert Samuel. I can't 'elp it! I
  can't fight against the lor."</p>

  <p>"You 'aven't any right to spend my money," said Bealby.</p>

  <p>"Down't cut up crusty. 'Ow can <i>I</i> 'elp it?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell a policeman. You gimme back my money and lemme go."</p>

  <p>The tramp considered the social atmosphere. It did not contain a
  policeman. It contained nothing but a peaceful kindly corner public-house, a
  sleeping dog and the back of an elderly man digging.</p>

  <p>The tramp approached Bealby in a confidential manner. "'Oo's going to
  believe you?" he said. "And besides, 'ow did you come by it?"</p>

  <p>Moreover. "<i>I</i> ain't going to spend your money. I got money of my
  own. 'Ere! See?" And suddenly before the dazzled eyes of Bealby he held and
  instantly withdrew three shillings and two coppers that seemed familiar. He
  had had a shilling of his own....</p>

  <p>Bealby waited outside....</p>

  <p>The tramp emerged in a highly genial mood, with acid drops, and a short
  clay pipe going strong. "'Ere," he said to Bealby with just the faintest
  flavour of magnificence over the teeth-held pipe and handed over not only the
  acid drops but a virgin short clay. "Fill," he said, proffering the tobacco.
  "It's yours jus' much as it's mine. Be'r not let 'Erbert Samuel see you
  though; that's all. 'E's got a lor abart it."</p>

  <p>Bealby held his pipe in his clenched hand. He had already
  smoked&mdash;once . He remembered it quite vividly still, although it had
  happened six months ago. Yet he hated not using that tobacco. "No," he said,
  "I'll smoke later."</p>

  <p>The tramp replaced the screw of red Virginia in his pocket with the air of
  one who has done the gentlemanly thing....</p>

  <p>They went on their way, an ill-assorted couple.</p>

  <p>All day Bealby chafed at the tie and saw the security in the tramp's
  pocket vanish. They lunched on bread and cheese and then the tramp had a good
  sustaining drink of beer for both of them, and after that they came to a
  common where it seemed agreeable to repose. And after a due meed of repose in
  a secluded hollow among the gorse the tramp produced a pack of exceedingly
  greasy cards and taught Bealby to play Euchre. Apparently the tramp had no
  distinctive pockets in his tail coat, the whole lining was one capacious
  pocket. Various knobs and bulges indicated his cooking tin, his feeding tin,
  a turnip and other unknown properties. At first they played for love and then
  they played for the balance in the tramp's pocket. And by the time Bealby had
  learnt Euchre thoroughly, that balance belonged to the tramp. But he was very
  generous about it and said they would go on sharing just as they had done.
  And then he became confidential. He scratched about in the bagginess of his
  garment and drew out a little dark blade of stuff, like a flint implement,
  regarded it gravely for a moment and held it out to Bealby. "Guess what this
  is."</p>

  <p>Bealby gave it up.</p>

  <p>"Smell it."</p>

  <p>It smelt very nasty. One familiar smell indeed there was with a
  paradoxical sanitary quality that he did not quite identify, but that was a
  mere basis for a complex reek of acquisitions. "What is it?" said Bealby.
  "Soap!"</p>

  <p>"But what's it for?"</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd ask that.... What's soap usually for?"</p>

  <p>"Washing," said Bealby guessing wildly. The tramp shook his head. "Making
  a foam," he corrected. "That's what I has my fits with. See? I shoves a bit
  in my mouth and down I goes and I rolls about. Making a sort of moaning
  sound. Why, I been given brandy often&mdash;neat brandy.... It isn't always a
  cert&mdash;nothing's absolutely a cert. I've 'ad some let-downs.... Once I
  was bit by a nasty little dog&mdash;that brought me to pretty quick, and once
  I 'ad an old gentleman go through my pockets. ' Poor chap! ' 'e ses, 'very
  likely 'e's destitoot, let's see if 'e's got anything.' ... I'd got all sorts
  of things, I didn't want 'im prying about. But I didn't come-to sharp enough
  to stop 'im. Got me into trouble that did...."</p>

  <p>"It's an old lay," said the tramp, "but it's astonishing 'ow it'll go in a
  quiet village. Sort of amuses 'em. Or dropping suddenly in front of a bicycle
  party. Lot of them old tricks are the best tricks, and there ain't many of
  'em Billy Bridget don't know. That's where you're lucky to 'ave met me,
  matey. Billy Bridget's a 'ard man to starve. And I know the ropes. I know
  what you can do and what you can't do. And I got a feeling for a
  policeman&mdash; same as some people 'ave for cats. I'd know if one was
  'idden in the room...."</p>

  <p>He expanded into anecdotes and the story of various encounters in which he
  shone. It was amusing and it took Bealby on his weak side. Wasn't he the
  Champion Dodger of the Chelsome playground?</p>

  <p>The tide of talk ebbed. "Well," said the tramp, "time we was up and
  doing...."</p>

  <p>They went along shady lanes and across an open park, and they skirted a
  breezy common from which they could see the sea. And among other things that
  the tramp said was this, "Time we began to forage a bit."</p>

  <p>He turned his large observant nose to the right of him and the
  left.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 5</h3>

  <p class="first">Throughout the afternoon the tramp discoursed upon the
rights and wrongs
  of property, in a way that Bealby found very novel and unsettling. The tramp
  seemed to have his ideas about owning and stealing arranged quite differently
  from those of Bealby. Never before had Bealby thought it possible to have
  them arranged in any other than the way he knew. But the tramp contrived to
  make most possession seem unrighteous and honesty a code devised by those who
  have for those who haven't. "They've just got hold of it," he said. "They
  want to keep it to themselves.... Do I look as though I'd stole much of
  anybody's? It isn't me got 'old of this land and sticking up my notice boards
  to keep everybody off. It isn't me spends my days and nights scheming 'ow I
  can get 'old of more and more of the stuff....</p>

  <p>"I don't envy it 'em," said the tramp. "Some 'as one taste and some
  another. But when it comes to making all this fuss because a chap who isn't a
  schemer 'elps 'imself to a mathful,&mdash;well, it's Rot....</p>

  <p>"It's them makes the rules of the game and nobody ever arst me to play it.
  I don't blame 'em, mind you. Me and you might very well do the same. But
  brast me if I see where the sense of my keeping the rules comes in. This
  world ought to be a share out, Gawd meant it to be a share out. And me and
  you&mdash;we been done out of our share. That justifies us."</p>

  <p>"It isn't right to steal," said Bealby.</p>

  <p>"It isn't right to steal&mdash;certainly. It isn't right&mdash;but it's
  universal. Here's a chap here over this fence, ask 'im where 'e got 'is land.
  Stealing! What you call stealing, matey, <i>I</i> call restitootion. You
  ain't probably never even 'eard of socialism."</p>

  <p>"I've 'eard of socialists right enough. Don't believe in Gawd and 'aven't
  no morality."</p>

  <p>"Don't you believe it. Why!&mdash;'Arf the socialists are parsons. What
  I'm saying is socialism&mdash;practically. <i>I'm</i> a socialist. I know all
  abat socialism. There isn't nothing you can tell me abat socialism.
  Why!&mdash;for three weeks I was one of these here Anti-Socialist speakers.
  Paid for it. And I tell you there ain't such a thing as property left; it's
  all a blooming old pinch. Lords, commons, judges, all of them they're just a
  crew of brasted old fences and the lawyers getting in the stuff. Then you
  talk to me of stealing! Stealing I "</p>

  <p>The tramp's contempt and his long intense way of saying "stealing" were
  very unsettling to a sensitive mind.</p>

  <p>They bought some tea and grease in a village shop and the tramp made tea
  in his old tin with great dexterity, and then they gnawed bread on which two
  ounces of margarine had been generously distributed. "Live like fighting
  cocks, we do," said the tramp wiping out his simple cuisine with the
  dragged-out end of his shirt sleeve. "And if I'm not very much mistaken we'll
  sleep to-night on a nice bit of hay...."</p>

  <p>But these anticipations were upset by a sudden temptation, and instead of
  a starry summer comfort the two were destined to spend a night of suffering
  and remorse.</p>

  <p>A green lane lured them off the road, and after some windings led them
  past a field of wire-netted enclosures containing a number of perfect and
  conceited-looking hens close beside a little cottage, a vegetable garden and
  some new elaborate outhouses. It was manifestly a poultry farm, and something
  about it gave the tramp the conviction that it had been left, that nobody was
  at home.</p>

  <p>These realizations are instinctive, they leap to the mind. He knew it, and
  an ambition to know further what was in the cottage came with the knowledge.
  But it seemed to him desirable that the work of exploration should be done by
  Bealby. He had thought of dogs, and it seemed to him that Bealby might be
  unembarrassed by that idea. So he put the thing to Bealby. "Let's have a look
  round 'ere," he said. "You go in and see what's abat...."</p>

  <p>There was some difference of opinion. "I don't ask you to take anything,"
  said the tramp.... "Nobody won't catch you.... I tell you nobody won't catch
  you.... I tell you there ain't nobody here to catch you.... Just for the fun
  of seeing in. I'll go up by them outhouses. And I'll see nobody comes....
  Ain't afraid to go up a garden path, are you?... I tell you, I don't want you
  to steal.... You ain't got much guts to funk a thing like that.... I'll be
  abat too.... Thought you'd be the very chap for a bit of scouting.... Well,
  if you ain't afraid you'd do it.... Well, why didn't you say you'd do it at
  the beginning?..."</p>

  <p>Bealby went through the hedge and up a grass track between poultry runs,
  made a cautious inspection of the outhouses and then approached the cottage.
  Everything was still. He thought it more plausible to go to the door than
  peep into the window. He rapped. Then after an interval of stillness he
  lifted the latch, opened the door and peered into the room. It was a
  pleasantly furnished room, and before the empty summer fireplace a very old
  white man was sitting in a chintz-covered armchair, lost it would seem in
  painful thought. He had a peculiar grey shrunken look, his eyes were closed,
  a bony hand with the shiny texture of alabaster gripped the chair arm....
  There was something about him that held Bealby quite still for a moment.</p>

  <p>And this old gentleman behaved very oddly.</p>

  <p>His body seemed to crumple into his chair, his hands slipped down from the
  arms, his head nodded forwards and his mouth and eyes seemed to open
  together. And he made a snoring sound....</p>

  <p>For a moment Bealby remained rigidly agape and then a violent desire to
  rejoin the tramp carried him back through the hen-runs....</p>

  <p>He tried to describe what he had seen.</p>

  <p>"Asleep with his mouth open," said the tramp. "Well, that ain't anything
  so wonderful. You got anything? That's what I want to know.... Did anyone
  ever see such a boy? 'Ere! I'll go....</p>

  <p>"You keep a look out here," said the tramp.</p>

  <p>But there was something about that old man in there, something so strange
  and alien to Bealby, that he could not remain alone in the failing twilight.
  He followed the cautious advances of the tramp towards the house. From the
  corner by the outhouses he saw the tramp go and peer in at the open door. He
  remained for some time peering; his head hidden from Bealby....</p>

  <p>Then he went in....</p>

  <p>Bealby had an extraordinary desire that somebody else would come. His soul
  cried out for help against some vaguely apprehended terror. And in the very
  moment of his wish came its fulfilment. He saw advancing up the garden path a
  tall woman in a blue serge dress, hatless and hurrying and carrying a little
  package&mdash;it was medicine&mdash;in her hand. And with her came a big
  black dog. At the sight of Bealby the dog came forward barking, and Bealby
  after a moment's hesitation turned and fled.</p>

  <p>The dog was quick. But Bealby was quicker. He went up the netting of a
  hen-run and gave the dog no more than an ineffectual snap at his heels. And
  then dashing from the cottage door came the tramp. Under one arm was a brass-
  bound workbox and in the other was a candlestick and some smaller articles.
  He did not instantly grasp the situation of his treed companion, he was too
  anxious to escape the tall woman, and then with a yelp of dismay he
  discovered himself between woman and dog. All too late he sought to emulate
  Bealby. The workbox slipped from under his arm, the rest of his plunder fell
  from him, for an uneasy moment he was clinging to the side of the swaying
  hen-run and then it had caved in and the dog had got him.</p>

  <p>The dog bit, desisted and then finding itself confronted by two men
  retreated. Bealby and the tramp rolled and scrambled over the other side of
  the collapsed netting into a parallel track and were half-way to the hedge
  before the dog,&mdash;but this time in a less vehement fashion,&mdash;resumed
  his attack.</p>

  <p>He did not close with them again and at the hedge he halted altogether and
  remained hacking the gloaming with his rage.</p>

  <p>The woman it seemed had gone into the house, leaving the tramp's scattered
  loot upon the field of battle.</p>

  <p>"This means mizzle," said the tramp, leading the way at a trot.</p>

  <p>Bealby saw no other course but to follow.</p>

  <p>He had a feeling as though the world had turned against him. He did not
  dare to think what he was thinking of the events of these crowded ten
  minutes. He felt he had touched something dreadful; that the twilight was
  full of accusations.... He feared and hated the tramp now, but he perceived
  something had linked them as they had not been linked before. Whatever it was
  they shared it.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 6</h3>

  <p class="first">They fled through the night; it seemed to Bealby for
interminable hours.
  At last when they were worn out and footsore they crept through a gate and
  found an uncomfortable cowering-place in the corner of a field.</p>

  <p>As they went they talked but little, but the tramp kept up a constant
  muttering to himself. He was troubled by the thought of hydrophobia. "I know
  I'll 'ave it," he said, "I know I'll get it."</p>

  <p>Bealby after a time ceased to listen to his companion. His mind was
  preoccupied. He could think of nothing but that very white man in the chair
  and the strange manner of his movement.</p>

  <p>"Was 'e awake when you saw 'im?" he asked at last.</p>

  <p>"Awake&mdash;who?"</p>

  <p>"That old man."</p>

  <p>For a moment or so the tramp said nothing.</p>

  <p>"'E wasn't awake, you young silly," he said at last.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Why!&mdash;don't you know! 'E'd croaked,&mdash; popped off the
  'ooks&mdash;very moment you saw 'im.</p>

  <p>For a moment Bealby's voice failed him.</p>

  <p>Then he said quite faintly, "You mean&mdash; he'd Was dead?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't you know?" said the tramp. "Gaw! What a kid you are!"</p>

  <p>In that manner it was Bealby first saw a dead man. Never before had he
  seen anyone dead. And after that for all the night the old white man pursued
  him, with strange slowly-opening eyes, and a head on one side and his mouth
  suddenly and absurdly agape....</p>

  <p>All night long that white figure presided over seas of dark dismay. It
  seemed always to be there, and yet Bealby thought of a score of other painful
  things. For the first time in his life he asked himself, "Where am I going?
  What am I drifting to?" The world beneath the old man's dominance was a world
  of prisons.</p>

  <p>Bealby believed he was a burglar and behind the darkness he imagined the
  outraged law already seeking him. And the terrors of his associate reinforced
  his own.</p>

  <p>He tried to think what he should do in the morning. He dreaded the dawn
  profoundly. But he could not collect his thoughts because of the tramp's
  incessant lapses into grumbling lamentation. Bealby knew he had to get away
  from the tramp, but now he was too weary and alarmed to think of running away
  as a possible expedient. And besides there was the matter of his money. And
  beyond the range of the tramp's voice there were darknesses which to-night at
  least might hold inconceivable forms of lurking evil. But could he not appeal
  to the law to save him? Repent? Was there not something called turning King's
  Evidence?</p>

  <p>The moon was no comfort that night. Across it there passed with incredible
  slowness a number of jagged little black clouds, blacker than any clouds
  Bealby had ever seen before. They were like velvet palls, lined with snowy
  fur. There was no end to them. And one at last most horribly gaped slowly and
  opened a mouth....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 7</h3>

  <p class="first">At intervals there would be uncomfortable movements and the
voice of the
  tramp came out of the darkness beside Bealby lamenting his approaching fate
  and discoursing&mdash;sometimes with violent expressions&mdash;on
  watch-dogs.</p>

  <p>"I know I shall 'ave 'idrophobia," said the tramp. "I've always 'ad a
  disposition to 'idrophobia. Always a dread of water&mdash;and now it's got
  me.</p>

  <p>"Think of it!&mdash;keeping a beast to set at a 'uman being. Where's the
  brotherhood of it? Where's the law and the humanity? Getting a animal to set
  at a brother man. And a poisoned animal, a animal with death in his teeth.
  And a 'orrible death too. Where's the sense and brotherhood?</p>

  <p>"Gaw! when I felt 'is teeth coming through my trasers&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>"Dogs oughtn't to be allowed. They're a noosance in the towns and a danger
  in the country. They oughtn't to be allowed anywhere&mdash;not till every
  blessed 'uman being 'as got three square meals a day. Then if you like, keep
  a dog. And see 'e's a clean dog....</p>

  <p>"Gaw! if I'd been a bit quicker up that 'en roost!</p>

  <p>"I ought to 'ave landed 'im a kick.</p>

  <p>"It's a man's duty to 'urt a dog. When 'e sees a dog 'e ought to 'urt 'im.
  It's a natural 'atred. If dogs were what they ought to be, if dogs understood
  'ow they're situated, there wouldn't be a dog go for a man ever.</p>

  <p>"And if one did they'd shoot 'im....</p>

  <p>"After this if ever I get a chance to land a dog a oner with a stone I'll
  land 'im one. I been too sorft with dogs...."</p>

  <p>Towards dawn Bealby slept uneasily, to be awakened by the loud snorting
  curiosity of three lively young horses. He sat up in a blinding sunshine and
  saw the tramp looking very filthy and contorted, sleeping with his mouth wide
  open and an expression of dismay and despair on his face.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 8</h3>

  <p class="first">Bealby took his chance to steal away next morning while the
tramp was
  engaged in artificial epilepsy.</p>

  <p>"I feel like fits this morning," said the tramp. "I could do it well. I
  want a bit of human kindness again. After that brasted dog.</p>

  <p>"I expect soon I'll 'ave the foam all right withat any soap."</p>

  <p>They marked down a little cottage before which a benevolent-looking
  spectacled old gentleman in a large straw hat and a thin alpaca jacket was
  engaged in budding roses. Then they retired to prepare. The tramp handed over
  to Bealby various compromising possessions, which might embarrass an
  afflicted person under the searching hands of charity. There was for example
  the piece of soap after he had taken sufficient for his immediate needs,
  there was ninepence in money, there were the pack of cards with which they
  had played Euchre, a key or so and some wires, much assorted string, three
  tins, a large piece of bread, the end of a composite candle, a box of sulphur
  matches, list slippers, a pair of gloves, a clasp knife, sundry grey rags.
  They all seemed to have the distinctive flavour of the tramp....</p>

  <p>"If you do a bunk with these," said the tramp. "By Gawd "</p>

  <p>He drew his finger across his throat.</p>

  <p>(King's Evidence.)</p>

  <p>Bealby from a safe distance watched the beginnings of the fit and it
  impressed him as a thoroughly hasty kind of fit. He saw the elderly gentleman
  hurry out of the cottage and stand for a moment looking over his little green
  garden gate, surveying the sufferings of the tramp with an expression of
  intense yet discreet commiseration. Then suddenly he was struck by an idea,
  he darted in among his rose bushes and reappeared with a big watering-can and
  an enormous syringe. Still keeping the gate between himself and the sufferer
  he loaded his syringe very carefully and deliberately....</p>

  <p>Bealby would have liked to have seen more but he felt his moment had come.
  Another instant and it might be gone again. Very softly he dropped from the
  gate on which he was sitting and made off like a running partridge along the
  hedge of the field.</p>

  <p>Just for a moment did he halt&mdash;at a strange sharp yelp that came from
  the direction of the little cottage. Then his purpose of flight resumed its
  control of him.</p>

  <p>He would strike across country for two or three miles, then make for the
  nearest police station and give himself up. (Loud voices. Was that the tramp
  murdering the benevolent old gentleman in the straw hat, or was it the
  benevolent old gentleman in the straw hat murdering the tramp? No time to
  question. Onward, Onward!) The tramp's cans rattled in his pocket. He drew
  one out, hesitated a moment and flung it away and then sent its two
  companions after it....</p>

  <p>He found his police station upon the road between Someport and
  Crayminster, a little peaceful rural station, a mere sunny cottage with a
  blue and white label and a notice board covered with belated bills about the
  stealing of pheasants' eggs. And another bill</p>

  <p>It was headed "MISSING" and the next most conspicuous words were "&pound;5
  REWARD" and the next "ARTHUR BEALBY."</p>

  <p>He was fascinated. So swift, so terribly swift is the law. Already they
  knew of his burglary, of his callous participation in the robbing of a dead
  man. Already the sleuths were upon his trail. So surely did his conscience
  strike to this conclusion that even the carelessly worded offer of a reward
  that followed his description conveyed no different intimation to his mind.
  "To whomsoever will bring him back to Lady Laxton, at Shonts near Chelsmore,"
  so it ran.</p>

  <p>"And out of pocket expenses."</p>

  <p>And even as Bealby read this terrible document, the door of the police
  station opened and a very big pink young policeman came out and stood
  regarding the world in a friendly, self-approving manner. He had innocent,
  happy, blue eyes; thus far he had had much to do with order and little with
  crime; and his rosebud mouth would have fallen open, had not discipline
  already closed it and set upon it the beginnings of a resolute expression
  that accorded ill with the rest of his open freshness. And when he had
  surveyed the sky and the distant hills and the little rose bushes that
  occupied the leisure of the force, his eyes fell upon Bealby....</p>

  <p>Indecision has ruined more men than wickedness. And when one has slept
  rough and eaten nothing and one is conscious of a marred unclean appearance,
  it is hard to face one's situations. What Bealby had intended to do was to go
  right up to a policeman and say to him, simply and frankly: "I want to turn
  King's Evidence, please. I was in that burglary where there was a dead old
  man and a workbox and a woman and a dog. I was led astray by a bad character
  and I did not mean to do it. And really it was him that did it and not
  me."</p>

  <p>But now his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, he felt he could not
  speak, could not go through with it. His heart had gone down into his feet.
  Perhaps he had caught the tramp's constitutional aversion to the police. He
  affected not to see the observant figure in the doorway. He assumed a slack
  careless bearing like one who reads by chance idly. He lifted his eyebrows to
  express unconcern. He pursed his mouth to whistle but no whistle came. He
  stuck his hands into his pockets, pulled up his feet as one pulls up plants
  by the roots and strolled away.</p>

  <p>He quickened his stroll as he supposed by imperceptible degrees. He
  glanced back and saw that the young policeman had come out of the station and
  was reading the notice. And as the young policeman read he looked ever and
  again at Bealby like one who checks off items.</p>

  <p>Bealby quickened his pace and then, doing his best to suggest by the
  movements of his back a mere boyish levity quite unconnected with the law, he
  broke into a trot.</p>

  <p>Then presently he dropped back into a walking pace, pretended to see
  something in the hedge, stopped and took a sidelong look at the young
  policeman.</p>

  <p>He was coming along with earnest strides, every movement of his suggested
  a stealthy hurry!</p>

  <p>Bealby trotted and then becoming almost frank about it, ran. He took to
  his heels.</p>

  <p>From the first it was not really an urgent chase; it was a stalking rather
  than a hunt, because the young policeman was too young and shy and lacking in
  confidence really to run after a boy without any definite warrant for doing
  so. When anyone came along he would drop into a smart walk and pretend not to
  be looking at Bealby but just going somewhere briskly. And after two miles of
  it he desisted, and stood for a time watching a heap of mangold wurzel
  directly and the disappearance of Bealby obliquely, and then when Bealby was
  quite out of sight he turned back thoughtfully towards his proper place.</p>

  <p>On the whole he considered he was well out of it. He might have made a
  fool of himself ....</p>

  <p>And yet,&mdash;five pounds reward!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7">VII. &mdash; THE BATTLE OF CRAYMINSTER</a></h2>

  <h3>&sect; 1</h3>

  <p class="first">BEALBY was beginning to realize that running away from
one's situation and
  setting up for oneself is not so easy and simple a thing as it had appeared
  during those first days with the caravan. Three things he perceived had
  arisen to pursue him, two that followed in the daylight, the law and the
  tramp, and a third that came back at twilight, the terror of the darkness.
  And within there was a hollow faintness, for the afternoon was far advanced
  and he was extremely hungry. He had dozed away the early afternoon in the
  weedy corner of a wood. But for his hunger I think he would have avoided
  Crayminster.</p>

  <p>Within a mile of that place he had come upon the "Missing" notice again
  stuck to the end of a barn. He had passed it askance, and then with a sudden
  inspiration returned and torn</p>

  <p>it down. Somehow with the daylight his idea of turning King's Evidence
  against the tramp had weakened. He no longer felt sure.</p>

  <p>Mustn't one wait and be asked first to turn King's Evidence?</p>

  <p>Suppose they said he had merely confessed....</p>

  <p>The Crayminster street had a picturesque nutritious look. Half-way down it
  was the White Hart with cyclist club signs on its walls and geraniums over a
  white porch, and beyond a house being built and already at the roofing pitch.
  To the right was a baker's shop diffusing a delicious suggestion of buns and
  cake, and to the left a little comfortable sweetstuff window and a glimpse of
  tables and a board: " Teas." Tea! He resolved to break into his ninepence
  boldly and generously. Very likely they would boil him an egg for a penny or
  so. Yet on the other hand if he just had three or four buns, soft new buns.
  He hovered towards the baker's shop and stopped short. That bill was in the
  window!</p>

  <p>He wheeled about sharply and went into the sweetstuff shop and found a
  table with a white cloth and a motherly little woman in a large cap. Tea? He
  could have an egg and some thick bread-and-butter and a cup of tea for
  fivepence. He sat down respectfully to await her preparations.</p>

  <p>But he was uneasy.</p>

  <p>He knew quite well that she would ask him questions. For that he was
  prepared. He said he was walking from his home in London to Someport to save
  the fare. "But you're so dirty!" said the motherly little woman. "I sent my
  luggage by post, ma'm, and I lost my way and didn't get it. And I don't much
  mind, ma'm, if you don't. Not washing...."</p>

  <p>All that he thought he did quite neatly. But he wished there was not that
  bill in the baker's window opposite and he wished he hadn't quite such a
  hunted feeling. A faint claustrophobia affected him. He felt the shop might
  be a trap. He would be glad to get into the open again. Was there a way out
  behind if, for example, a policeman blocked the door? He hovered to the
  entrance while his egg was boiling, and then when he saw a large fat baker
  surveying the world with an afternoon placidity upon his face, he went back
  and sat by the table. He wondered if the baker had noted him.</p>

  <p>He had finished his egg; he was drinking his tea with appreciative noises,
  when he discovered that the baker had noted him. Bealby's eyes, at first
  inanely open above the tilting teacup, were suddenly riveted on something
  that was going on in the baker's window. From where he sat he could see that
  detestable bill, and then slowly, feeling about for it, he beheld a hand and
  a floury sleeve. The bill was drawn up and vanished, and then behind a glass
  shelf of fancy bread and a glass shelf of buns something pink and indistinct
  began to move jerkily.... It was a human face and it was trying to peer into
  the little refreshment shop that sheltered Bealby....</p>

  <p>Bealby's soul went faint.</p>

  <p>He had one inadequate idea. "Might I go out," he said, "by your back
  way?"</p>

  <p>"There isn't a back way," said the motherly little woman. "There's a yard
  "</p>

  <p>"If I might," said Bealby and was out in it.</p>

  <p>No way at all! High walls on every side. He was back like a shot in the
  shop, and now the baker was half-way across the road. "Five-pence," said
  Bealby and gave the little old woman sixpence. "Here," she cried, "take your
  penny!"</p>

  <p>He did not wait. He darted out of the door.</p>

  <p>The baker was all over the way of escape. He extended arms that seemed
  abnormally long and with a weak cry Bealby found himself trapped. Trapped,
  but not hopelessly. He knew how to do it. He had done it in milder forms
  before, but now he did it with all his being. Under the diaphragm of the
  baker smote Bealby' s hard little head, and instantly he was away running up
  the quiet sunny street. Man when he assumed the erect attitude made a hostage
  of his belly. It is a proverb among the pastoral Berbers of the Atlas
  mountains that the man who extends his arms in front of an angry ram is a
  fool.</p>

  <p>It seemed probable to Bealby that he would get away up the street. The
  baker was engaged in elaborately falling backward, making the most of sitting
  down in the road, and the wind had been knocked out of him so that he could
  not shout. He emitted " Stop him!" in large whispers. Away ahead there were
  only three builder's men sitting under the wall beyond the White Hart,
  consuming tea out of their tea-cans. But the boy who was trimming the top of
  the tall privet hedge outside the doctor's saw the assault of the baker and
  incontinently uttered the shout that the baker could not. Also he fell off
  his steps with great alacrity and started in pursuit of Bealby. A young man
  from anywhere&mdash;perhaps the grocer's shop&mdash; also started for Bealby.
  But the workmen were slow to rise to the occasion. Bealby could have got past
  them. And then, abruptly at the foot of the street ahead, the tramp came into
  view, a battered disconcerting figure. His straw-coloured hat which had
  recently been wetted and dried in the sun was a swaying mop. The sight of
  Bealby seemed to rouse him from some disagreeable meditations. He grasped the
  situation with a terrible quickness.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the wisdom of the pastoral Berbers he extended his arms and
  stood prepared to intercept.</p>

  <p>Bealby thought at the rate of a hundred thoughts to the minute. He darted
  sideways and was up the ladder and among the beams and rafters of the
  unfinished roof before the pursuit had more than begun. "Here, come off
  that," cried the foreman builder, only now joining in the hunt with any
  sincerity. He came across the road while Bealby regarded him wickedly from
  the rafters above. Then as the good man made to ascend Bealby got him neatly
  on the hat&mdash;it was a bowler hat&mdash;with a tile. This checked the
  advance. There was a disposition to draw a little off and look up at Bealby.
  One of the younger builders from the opposite sidewalk got him very neatly in
  the ribs with a stone. But two other shots went wide, and Bealby shifted to a
  more covered position behind the chimney-stack.</p>

  <p>From here however he had a much less effective command of the ladder, and
  he perceived that his tenure of the new house was not likely to be a long
  one.</p>

  <p>Below men parleyed. "Who is 'e?" asked the foreman builder. "Where'd 'e
  come from?" "'E's a brasted little thief," said the tramp. '"E's one of the
  wust characters on the road." The baker was recovering his voice now.</p>

  <p>"There's a reward out for 'im," he said, "and 'e butted me in the
  stummick."</p>

  <p>"'Ow much reward?" asked the foreman builder.</p>

  <p>"Five pound for the man who catches him."</p>

  <p>"'Ere!" cried the foreman builder in an arresting voice to the tramp.
  "Just stand away from that ladder...."</p>

  <p>Whatever else Bealby might or might not be, one thing was very clear about
  him and that was that he was a fugitive. And the instinct of humanity is to
  pursue fugitives. Man is a hunting animal, inquiry into the justice of a case
  is an altogether later accretion to his complex nature, and that is why,
  whatever you are or whatever you do you should never let people get you on
  the run. There is a joy in the mere fact of hunting, the sight of a scarlet
  coat and a hound will brighten a whole village, and now Crayminster was
  rousing itself like a sleeper who wakes to sunshine and gay music. People
  were looking out of windows and coming out of shops, a policeman appeared and
  heard the baker's simple story, a brisk hatless young man in a white apron
  and with a pencil behind his ear became prominent. Bealby, peeping over the
  ridge of the roof, looked a thoroughly dirty and unpleasant little creature
  to all these people.</p>

  <p>The only spark of human sympathy for him below was in the heart of the
  little old woman in the cap who had given him his breakfast. She surveyed the
  roof of the new house from the door of her shop, she hoped Bealby wouldn't
  hurt himself up there, and she held his penny change clutched in her hand in
  her apron pocket with a vague idea that perhaps presently if he ran past she
  could very quickly give it him.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Considerable delay in delivering the assault on the house
was caused by
  the foreman's insistence that he alone should ascend the ladder to capture
  Bealby. He was one of those regular-featured men with large heads who seem to
  have inflexible backbones, he was large and fair and full with a sweetish
  chest voice, and in all his movements authoritative and deliberate. Whenever
  he made to ascend he discovered that people were straying into his building,
  and he had to stop and direct his men how to order them off. Inside his large
  head he was trying to arrange everybody to cut off Bealby's line of retreat
  without risking that anybody but himself should capture the fugitive. It was
  none too easy and it knitted his brows. Meanwhile Bealby was able to
  reconnoitre the adjacent properties and to conceive plans for a possible line
  of escape. He also got a few tiles handy against when the rush up the ladder
  came. At the same time two of the younger workmen were investigating the
  possibility of getting at him from inside the house. There was still no
  staircase, but there were ways of clambering. They had heard about the
  reward and they knew that they must do this before the foreman realized their
  purpose, and this a little retarded them. In their pockets they had a number
  of stones, ammunition in reserve, if it came again to throwing.</p>

  <p>Bealby was no longer fatigued nor depressed; anxiety for the future was
  lost in the excitement of the present, and his heart told him that, come what
  might, getting on to the roof was an extraordinarily good dodge.</p>

  <p>And if only he could bring off a certain jump he had in mind, there were
  other dodges....</p>

  <p>In the village street an informal assembly of leading citizens, a little
  recovered now from their first nervousness about flying tiles, discussed the
  problem of Bealby. There was Mumby, the draper and vegetarian, with the bass
  voice and the big black beard. He advocated the fire engine. He was one of
  the volunteer fire brigade and never so happy as when he was wearing his
  helmet. He had come out of his shop, at the shouting. Schocks the butcher,
  and his boy were also in the street; Schocks's yard with its heap of manure
  and fodder bounded the new house on the left. Rymell the vet emerged from the
  billiard-room of the White Hart, and with his head a little on one side was
  watching Bealby and replying attentively to the baker, who was asking him a
  number of questions that struck him as irrelevant. All the White Hart people
  were in the street.</p>

  <p>"I suppose, Mr. Rymell," said the baker, "there's a mort of dangerous
  things in a man's belly round about 'is Stummick?"</p>

  <p>"Tiles," said Mr. Rymell. "Loose bricks. It wouldn't do if he started
  dropping those."</p>

  <p>"I was saying, Mr. Rymell," said the baker after a pause for digestion,
  "is a man likely to be injured badly by a Blaw in his stummick?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Rymell stared at him for a moment with unresponsive eyes. "More likely
  to get you in the head," he said, and then, "Here! What's that fool of a
  carpenter going to do?"</p>

  <p>The tramp was hovering on the outskirts of the group of besiegers,
  vindictive but dispirited. He had been brought to from his fit and given a
  shilling by the old gentleman, but he was dreadfully wet between his
  shirt&mdash;he wore a shirt, under three waistcoats and a coat&mdash;and his
  skin, because the old gentleman's method of revival had been to syringe him
  suddenly with cold water. It had made him weep with astonishment and misery.
  Now he saw no advantage in claiming Bealby publicly. His part, he felt, was
  rather a waiting one. What he had to say to Bealby could be best said without
  the assistance of a third person. And he wanted to understand more of this
  talk about a reward. If there was a reward out for Bealby</p>

  <p>"That's not a bad dodge!" said Rymell, changing his opinion of the foreman
  suddenly as that individual began his ascent of the ladder with a
  bricklayer's hod carried shield-wise above his head. He went up with
  difficulty and slowly because of the extreme care he took to keep his head
  protected. But no tiles came. Bealby had discovered a more dangerous attack
  developing inside the house and was already in retreat down the other side of
  the building.</p>

  <p>He did a leap that might have hurt him badly, taking off from the corner
  of the house and jumping a good twelve feet on to a big heap of straw in the
  butcher's yard. He came down on all fours and felt a little jarred for an
  instant, and then he was up again and had scrambled up by a heap of manure to
  the top of the butcher's wall. He was over that and into Maccullum's yard
  next door before anyone in the front of the new house had realized that he
  was in flight. Then one of the two workmen who had been coming up inside the
  house saw him from the oblong opening that was some day to be the upstairs
  bedroom window, and gave tongue.</p>

  <p>It was thirty seconds later and after Bealby had vanished from the
  butcher's wall that the foreman, still clinging to his hod, appeared over the
  ridge of the roof. At the workman's shout the policeman who, with the
  preventive disposition of his profession, had hitherto been stopping anyone
  from coming into the unfinished house, turned about and ran out into its
  brick and plaster and timber-littered backyard, whereupon the crowd in the
  street realizing that the quarry had gone away and no longer restrained, came
  pouring partly through the house and partly round through the butcher's gate
  into his yard.</p>

  <p>Bealby had had a check.</p>

  <p>He had relied upon the tarred felt roof of the mushroom shed of Maccullum
  the tailor and breeches-maker to get him to the wall that gave upon Mr.
  Benshaw's strawberry fields, and he had not seen from his roof above the
  ramshackle glazed outhouse which Maccullum called his workroom and in which
  four industrious tailors were working in an easy deshabille. The roof of the
  shed was the merest tarred touchwood, it had perished as felt long ago, it
  collapsed under Bealby, he went down into a confusion of mushrooms and
  mushroom-bed, he blundered out trailing mushrooms and spawn and rich matter,
  he had a nine-foot wall to negotiate and only escaped by a hair's-breadth
  from the clutch of a little red-slippered man who came dashing out from the
  workroom. But by a happy use of the top of the dustbin he did just get away
  over the wall in time, and the red-slippered tailor who was not good at walls
  was left struggling to imitate an ascent that had looked easy enough until he
  came to try it.</p>

  <p>For a moment the little tailor struggled alone, and then both Maccullum's
  domain and the butcher's yard next door and the narrow patch of space behind
  the new house, were violently injected with a crowd of active people, all
  confusedly on the Bealby trail. Someone, he never knew who, gave the little
  tailor a leg-up and then his red slippers twinkled over the wall and he was
  leading the hunt into the market gardens of Mr. Benshaw. A collarless
  colleague in list slippers and conspicuous braces followed. The policeman,
  after he had completed the wreck of Mr. Maccullum's mushroom shed, came next,
  and then Mr. Maccullum, with no sense of times and seasons, anxious to have a
  discussion at once upon the question of this damage. Mr. Maccullum was out of
  breath and he never got farther with this projected conversation than "
  Here!" This was repeated several times as opportunity seemed to offer. The
  remaining tailors got to the top of the wall more sedately with the help of
  the Maccullum kitchen steps and dropped; Mr. Schocks followed breathing hard,
  and then a fresh jet of humanity came squirting into the gardens through a
  gap in the fence at the back of the building site. This was led by the young
  workman who had first seen Bealby go away. Hard behind him came Rymell, the
  vet, the grocer's assistant, the doctor's page-boy and, less briskly, the
  baker. Then the tramp. Then Mumby and Schocks's boy. Then a number of other
  people. The seeking of Bealby had assumed the dimensions of a Hue and
  Cry.</p>

  <p>The foreman with the large head and the upright back was still on the new
  roof; he was greatly distressed at the turn things had taken and shouted his
  claims to a major share in the capture of Bealby, mixed with his opinions of
  Bealby and a good deal of mere swearing, to a sunny but unsympathetic
  sky....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr. Benshaw was a small holder, a sturdy English yeoman of
the new school.
  He was an Anti-Socialist, a self-helper, an independent-spirited man. He had
  a steadily growing banking account and a plain but sterile wife, and he was
  dark in complexion and so erect in his bearing as to seem a little to lean
  forward. Usually he wore a sort of grey gamekeeper's suit with brown gaiters
  (except on Sundays when the coat was black), he was addicted to bowler hats
  that accorded ill with his large grave grey-coloured face, and he was
  altogether a very sound strong man. His bowler hats did but accentuate that.
  He had no time for vanities, even the vanity of dressing consistently. He
  went into the nearest shop and just bought the cheapest hat he could, and so
  he got hats designed for the youthful and giddy, hats with flighty crowns and
  flippant bows and amorous brims that undulated attractively to set off
  flushed and foolish young faces. It made his unrelenting face look rather
  like the Puritans under the Stuart monarchy.</p>

  <p>He was a horticulturist rather than a farmer. He had begun his career in
  cheap lodgings with a field of early potatoes and cabbages, supplemented by
  employment, but with increased prosperity his area of cultivation had
  extended and his methods intensified. He now grew considerable quantities of
  strawberries, raspberries, celery, seakale, asparagus, early peas, late peas
  and onions, and consumed more stable manure than any other cultivator within
  ten miles of Crayminster. He was beginning to send cut flowers to London. He
  had half an acre of glass and he was rapidly extending it. He had built
  himself a cottage on lines of austere economy, and a bony-looking
  dwelling-house for some of his men. He also owned a number of useful sheds of
  which tar and corrugated iron were conspicuous features. His home was
  furnished with the utmost respectability, and notably joyless even in a
  countryside where gaiety is regarded as an impossible quality in furniture.
  He was already in a small local way a mortgagee. Good fortune had not turned
  the head of Mr. Benshaw nor robbed him of the feeling that he was a
  particularly deserving person, entitled to a preferential treatment from a
  country which in his plain unsparing way he felt that he enriched</p>

  <p>In many ways he thought that the country was careless of his needs. And in
  none more careless than in the laws relating to trespass. Across his
  dominions ran three footpaths, and one of these led to the public elementary
  school. That he should have to maintain this latter&mdash;and if he did not
  keep it in good order the children spread out and made parallel tracks among
  his cultivations&mdash;seemed to him a thing almost intolerably unjust. He
  mended it with cinders, acetylene refuse, which he believed and hoped to be
  thoroughly bad for boots, and a peculiarly slimy chalky clay, and he put on a
  board at each end "Keep to the footpaths, Trespassers will be prosecuted, by
  Order," which he painted himself to save expense when he was confined indoors
  by the influenza. Still more unjust it would be, he felt, for him to spend
  money upon effective fencing, and he could find no fencing cheap enough and
  ugly enough and painful enough and impossible enough to express his feelings
  in the matter. Every day the children streamed to and fro, marking how his
  fruits ripened and his produce became more esculent. And other people pursued
  these tracks, many Mr. Benshaw was convinced went to and fro through his
  orderly crops who had no business whatever, no honest business, to pass that
  way. Either, he concluded, they did it to annoy him, or they did it to injure
  him. This continual invasion aroused in Mr. Benshaw all that stern anger
  against unrighteousness latent in our race which more than any other single
  force has made America and the Empire what they are to-day. Once already he
  had been robbed &mdash;a raid upon his raspberries&mdash;and he felt
  convinced that at any time he might be robbed again. He had made
  representations to the local authority to get the footpaths closed, but in
  vain. They defended themselves with the paltry excuse that the children would
  then have to go nearly a mile round to the school.</p>

  <p>It was not only the tyranny of these footpaths that offended Mr. Benshaw's
  highly developed sense of Individual Liberty. All round his rather straggling
  dominions his neighbours displayed an ungenerous indisposition to maintain
  their fences to his satisfaction. In one or two places, in abandonment of his
  clear rights in the matter, he had at his own expense supplemented these lax
  defences with light barbed wire defences. But it was not a very satisfactory
  sort of barbed wire. He wanted barbed wire with extra spurs like a fighting
  cock; he wanted barbed wire that would start out after nightfall and attack
  passers-by. This boundary trouble was universal; in a way it was worse than
  the footpaths which after all only affected the Cage Fields where his
  strawberries grew. Except for the yard and garden walls of Maccullum and
  Schocks and that side, there was not really a satisfactory foot of enclosure
  all round Mr. Benshaw. On the one side rats and people's dogs and scratching
  cats came in, on the other side rabbits. The rabbits were intolerable, and
  recently there had been a rise of nearly thirty per cent, in the price of
  wire netting.</p>

  <p>Mr. Benshaw wanted to hurt rabbits; he did not want simply to kill them,
  he wanted so to kill them as to put the fear of death into the burrows. He
  wanted to kill them so that scared little furry survivors with their tails as
  white as ghosts would go lolloping home and say, "I say, you chaps, we'd
  better shift out of this. We're up against a Strong Determined Man...."</p>

  <p>I have made this lengthy statement of Mr. Benshaw's economic and moral
  difficulties in order that the reader should understand the peculiar tension
  that already existed upon this side of Cray minster. It has been necessary to
  do so now because in a few seconds there will be no further opportunity for
  such preparations. There had been trouble, I may add very hastily, about the
  shooting of Mr. Benshaw's gun; a shower of small shot had fallen out of the
  twilight upon the umbrella and basket of old Mrs. Frobisher. And only a week
  ago an unsympathetic bench after a hearing of over an hour and in the face of
  overwhelming evidence had refused to convict little Lucy Mumby, aged eleven,
  of stealing fruit from Mr. Benshaw's fields. She had been caught
  red-handed....</p>

  <p>At the very moment that Bealby was butting the baker in the stomach, Mr.
  Benshaw was just emerging from his austere cottage after a wholesome but
  inexpensive high tea in which he had finished up two left-over cold sausages,
  and he was considering very deeply the financial side of a furious black
  fence that he had at last decided should pen in the school children from
  further depredations. It should be of splintery tarred deal, and high, with
  well-pointed tops studded with sharp nails, and he believed that by making
  the path only two feet wide, a real saving of ground for cultivation might be
  made and a very considerable discomfort for the public arranged, to
  compensate for his initial expense. The thought of a narrow lane which would
  in winter be characterized by an excessive sliminess and from which there
  would be no lateral escape was pleasing to a mind by no means absolutely
  restricted to considerations of pounds, shillings and pence. In his hand
  after his custom he carried a hoe, on the handle of which feet were marked so
  that it was available not only for destroying the casual weed but also for
  purposes of measurement. With this he now checked his estimate, and found
  that here he would reclaim as much as three feet of trodden waste, here a
  full two.</p>

  <p>Absorbed in these calculations, he heeded little the growth of a certain
  clamour from the backs of the houses bordering on the High Street. It did not
  appear to concern him, and Mr. Benshaw made it almost ostentatiously his rule
  to mind his own business. His eyes remained fixed on the lumpy, dusty
  sun-baked track, that with an intelligent foresight he saw already
  transformed into a deterrent slough of despond for the young....</p>

  <p>Then quite suddenly the shouting took on a new note. He glanced over his
  shoulder almost involuntarily and discovered that after all this uproar was
  his business. Amazingly his business. His mouth assumed a Cromwellian
  fierceness. His grip tightened on his hoe. That anyone should dare! But it
  was impossible!</p>

  <p>His dominions were being invaded with a peculiar boldness and
  violence.</p>

  <p>Ahead of everyone else and running with wild wavings of the arms across
  his strawberries was a small and very dirty little boy. He impressed Mr.
  Benshaw merely as a pioneer. Some thirty yards behind him was a little
  collarless, short-sleeved man in red slippers running with great effrontery
  and behind him another still more denuded lunatic, also in list slippers and
  with braces&mdash;braces of inconceivable levity. And then Wiggs, the
  policeman, hotly followed by Mr. Maccullum. Then more distraught tailors and
  Schocks the butcher. But a louder shout heralded the main attack and Mr.
  Benshaw turned his eyes&mdash;already they were slightly blood-shot
  eyes&mdash;to the right and saw, pouring through the broken hedge, a
  disorderly crowd, Rymell whom he had counted his friend, the grocer's
  assistant, the doctor's boy, some strangers&mdash;Mumby!</p>

  <p>At the sight of Mumby, Mr. Benshaw leapt at a conclusion. He saw it all.
  The whole place was rising against him; they were asserting some infernal new
  right-of-way. Mumby&mdash;Mumby had got them to do it. All the fruits of
  fifteen years of toil, all the care and accumulation of Mr. Benshaw's prime,
  were to be trampled and torn to please a draper's spite!....</p>

  <p>Sturdy yeoman as Mr. Benshaw was he resolved instantly to fight for his
  liberties. One moment he paused to blow the powerful police whistle he
  carried in his pocket, and then rushed forward in the direction of the hated
  Mumby, the leader of trespassers, the parent and abetter and defender of the
  criminal Lucy. He took the hurrying panting man almost unawares, and with one
  wild sweep of the hoe felled him to the earth. Then he staggered about and
  smote again, but not quite in time to get the head of Mr. Rymell.</p>

  <p>This whistle he carried was part of a systematic campaign he had developed
  against trespassers and fruit stealers. He and each of his assistants carried
  one, and at the first shrill note&mdash;it was his rule&mdash;everyone seized
  on any weapon that was handy and ran to pursue and capture. All his
  assistants were extraordinarily prompt in responding to these alarms, which
  were often the only break in long days of strenuous and strenuously directed
  toil. So now with an astonishing promptitude and animated faces men appeared
  from sheds and greenhouses and distant patches of culture hastening to the
  assistance of their dour employer.</p>

  <p>It says much for the amiable relations that existed between employers and
  employed in those days before Syndicalism became the creed of the younger
  workers that they did hurry to his assistance.</p>

  <p>But many rapid things were to happen before they came into action. For
  first a strange excitement seized upon the tramp. A fantastic delusive sense
  of social rehabilitation took possession of his soul. Here he was pitted
  against a formidable hoe-wielding man, who for some inscrutable reason was
  resolved to cover the retreat of Bealby. And all the world, it seemed, was
  with the tramp and against this hoe-wielder. All the tremendous forces of
  human society against which the tramp had struggled for so many years, whose
  power he knew and feared as only the outlaw can, had suddenly come into line
  with him. Across the strawberries to the right there was even a policeman
  hastening to join the majority, a policeman closely followed by a tradesman
  of the blackest, most respectable quality. The tramp had a vision of himself
  as a respectable man heroically leading respectable people against outcasts.
  He dashed the lank hair from his eyes, waved his arms laterally and then with
  a loud strange cry flung himself towards Mr. Benshaw. Two pairs of
  superimposed coat-tails flapped behind him. And then the hoe whistled through
  the air and the tramp fell to the ground like a sack.</p>

  <p>But now Schocks's boy had grasped his opportunity. He had been working
  discreetly round behind Mr. Benshaw and as the hoe smote he leapt upon that
  hero's back and seized him about the neck with both arms and bore him
  staggering to the ground, and Rymell, equally quick, and used to the tackling
  of formidable creatures, had snatched and twisted away the hoe and grappled
  Mr. Benshaw almost before he was down. The first of Mr. Benshaw's helpers to
  reach the fray found the issue decided, his master held down conclusively and
  a growing circle trampling down a wide area of strawberry plants about the
  panting group....</p>

  <p>Mr. Mumby more frightened than hurt was already sitting up, but the tramp
  with a glowing wound upon his cheekbone and an expression of astonishment in
  his face, lay low and pawed the earth.</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean," gasped Mr. Rymell, "hitting people about with that
  hoe?"</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean," groaned Mr. Benshaw, "running across my
  strawberries?"</p>

  <p>"We were going after that boy."</p>

  <p>"Pounds and pounds worth of damage. Mischief and wickedness Mumby!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Rymell, suddenly realizing the true values of the situation, released
  Mr. Benshaw's hands and knelt up. "Look here, Mr. Benshaw," he said, "you
  seem to be under the impression we are trespassing."</p>

  <p>Mr. Benshaw struggling into a sitting position was understood to inquire
  with some heat what Mr. Rymell called it. Schocks's boy picked up the hat
  with the erotic brim and handed it to the horticulturist silently and
  respectfully.</p>

  <p>"We were not trespassing," said Mr. Rymell. "We were following up that
  boy. He was trespassing if you like.... By the bye,&mdash; where is the boy?
  Has anyone caught him?"</p>

  <p>At the question attention which had been focused upon Mr. Benshaw and his
  hoe, came round. Across the field in the direction of the sunlit half-acre of
  glass the little tailor was visible standing gingerly and picking up his red
  slippers for the third time&mdash;they would come off in that loose good
  soil, everybody else had left the trail to concentrate on Mr. Benshaw&mdash;
  and Bealby Bealby was out of sight. He</p>

  <p>had escaped, clean got away.</p>

  <p>"What boy?" asked Mr. Benshaw.</p>

  <p>"Ferocious little beast who's fought us like a rat. Been committing all
  sorts of crimes about the country. Five pounds reward for him."</p>

  <p>"Fruit stealing?" asked Mr. Benshaw.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Rymell, chancing it.</p>

  <p>Mr. Benshaw reflected slowly. His eyes surveyed his trampled crops.
  "Goooooooooooooo Lord!" he cried. "Look at those strawberries!" His voice
  gathered violence. "And that lout there!" he said. "Why!&mdash;he's lying on
  them! That's the brute who went for me!"</p>

  <p>"You got him a pretty tidy one aside the head!" said Maccullum.</p>

  <p>The tramp rolled over on some fresh strawberries and groaned
  pitifully.</p>

  <p>"He's hurt;' said Mr. Mumby.</p>

  <p>The tramp flopped and lay still.</p>

  <p>"Get some water!" said Rymell, standing</p>

  <p>up.</p>

  <p>At the word water, the tramp started convulsively, rolled over and sat up
  with a dazed expression.</p>

  <p>"No water," he said weakly. "No more water," and then catching Mr.
  Benshaw's eye he got rather quickly to his feet.</p>

  <p>Everybody who wasn't already standing was getting up, and everyone now was
  rather carefully getting himself off any strawberry plant he had chanced to
  find himself smashing in the excitement of the occasion.</p>

  <p>"That's the man that started in on me," said Mr. Benshaw. "What's he doing
  here? Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"Who are you, my man? What business have you to be careering over this
  field?" asked Mr. Rymell.</p>

  <p>"I was only 'elping," said the tramp.</p>

  <p>"Nice help," said Mr. Benshaw.</p>

  <p>"I thought that boy was a thief or something."</p>

  <p>"And so you made a rush at me."</p>

  <p>"I didn't exactly&mdash;sir I thought you</p>

  <p>was 'elping 'im."</p>

  <p>"You be off anyhow," said Mr. Benshaw. "Whatever you thought."</p>

  <p>Yes, you be off!" said Mr. Rymell. That's the way, my man," said Mr.
  Benshaw. "We haven't any jobs for you. The sooner we have you out of it the
  better for everyone. Get right on to the path and keep it." And with a
  desolating sense of exclusion the tramp withdrew. "There's pounds and pounds
  worth of damage here," said Mr. Benshaw. "This job'll cost me a pretty penny.
  Look at them berries there. Why they ain't fit for jam!</p>

  <p>And all done by one confounded boy." An evil light came into Mr. Benshaw's
  eyes. "You leave him to me and my chaps. If he's gone up among those sheds
  there&mdash;we'll settle with him. Anyhow there's no reason why my fruit
  should be trampled worse than it has been. Fruit stealer, you say, he
  is?"</p>

  <p>"They live on the country this time of year," said Mr. Mumby.</p>

  <p>"And catch them doing a day's work picking!" said Mr. Benshaw. "I know the
  sort."</p>

  <p>"There's a reward of five pounds for 'im already," said the
  baker....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 4</h3>

  <p class="first">You perceive how humanitarian motives may sometimes defeat
their own end,
  and how little Lady Laxton's well-intentioned handbills were serving to
  rescue Bealby. Instead they were turning him into a scared and hunted animal.
  In spite of its manifest impossibility he was convinced that the reward and
  this pursuit had to do with his burglary of the poultry farm, and that his
  capture would be but the preliminary to prison, trial and sentence. His one
  remaining idea was to get away. But his escape across the market gardens had
  left him so blown and spent, that he was obliged to hide up for a time in
  this perilous neighbourhood, before going on. He saw a disused-looking shed
  in the lowest corner of the gardens behind the greenhouses and by doubling
  sharply along a hedge he got to it unseen. It was not disused&mdash;nothing
  in Mr. Benshaw's possession ever was absolutely disused, but it was filled
  with horticultural lumber, with old calcium carbide tins, with broken
  wheelbarrows and damaged ladders awaiting repair, with some ragged wheeling
  planks and surplus rolls of roofing felt. At the back were some unhinged shed
  doors leaning against the wall, and between them Bealby tucked himself neatly
  and became still, glad of any respite from the chase.</p>

  <p>He would wait for twilight and then get away across the meadows at the
  back and then</p>

  <p>go He didn't know whither. And now</p>

  <p>he had no confidence in the wild world any more. A qualm of home-sickness
  for the compact little gardener's cottage at Shonts, came to Bealby. Why, as
  a matter of fact, wasn't he there now?</p>

  <p>He ought to have tried more at Shonts.</p>

  <p>He ought to have minded what they told him and not have taken up a
  toasting-fork against Thomas. Then he wouldn't now have been a hunted burglar
  with a reward of five pounds on his head and nothing in his pocket but
  threepence and a pack of greasy playing cards, a box of sulphur matches and
  various objectionable sundries, none of which were properly his own.</p>

  <p>If only he could have his time over again!</p>

  <p>Such wholesome reflections occupied his thoughts until the onset of the
  dusk stirred him to departure. He crept out of his hiding-place and stretched
  his limbs which had got very stiff, and was on the point of reconnoitring
  from the door of the shed when he became aware of stealthy footsteps
  outside.</p>

  <p>With the quickness of an animal he shot back into his hiding-place. The
  footsteps had halted. For a long time it seemed the unseen waited listening.
  Had he heard Bealby?</p>

  <p>Then someone fumbled with the door of the shed, it opened and there was a
  long pause of cautious inspection.</p>

  <p>Then the unknown had shuffled into the shed and sat down on a heap of
  matting.</p>

  <p>"Gaw!" said a voice.</p>

  <p>The tramp's!</p>

  <p>"If ever I struck a left-handed Mascot it was that boy," said the tramp.
  "The little swine! "</p>

  <p>For the better part of two minutes he went on from this mild beginning to
  a descriptive elaboration of Bealby. For the first time in his life Bealby
  learnt how unfavourable was the impression he might leave on a fellow-
  creature's mind.</p>

  <p>"Took even my matches!" cried the tramp, and tried this statement over
  with variations.</p>

  <p>"First that old fool with his syringe!" The tramp's voice rose in angry
  protest. "' Here's a chap dying epilepsy on your doorstep and all you can do
  is to squirt cold water at him! Cold water! Why you might kill a man doing
  that! And then say you'd thought' d bring 'im rand! Bring 'im rand! You be
  jolly glad I didn't stash your silly face in. You [misbegotten] old fool!
  What's a shilling for wetting a man to 'is skin? Wet through I was. Running
  inside my shirt,&mdash;dripping.... And then the blooming boy clears!</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> don't know what boys are coming to!"</p>

  <p>cried the tramp. "These board schools it is.</p>

  <p>Gets 'old of everything 'e can and bunks!</p>

  <p>Gaw! if I get my 'ands on 'im, I'll show 'im. I'll "</p>

  <p>For some time the tramp revelled in the details, for the most part crudely
  surgical, of his vengeance upon Bealby....</p>

  <p>"Then there's that dog bite. 'Ow do I know 'ow that's going to turn at? If
  I get 'idrophobia, blowed if I don't <i>bite</i> some of 'em. 'Idrophobia.
  Screaming and foaming. Nice death for a man&mdash;my time o' life! Bark I
  shall. Bark and bite.</p>

  <p>"And this is your world," said the tramp.</p>

  <p>"This is the world you put people into and expect 'em to be 'appy....</p>

  <p>"I'd like to bite that dough-faced fool with the silly 'at. I'd enjoy
  biting 'im. I'd spit it out, but I'd bite it right enough. Wiping abat with
  'is 'O. Gaw! Get off my ground! Be orf with you. Slash. 'E ought to be shut
  up.</p>

  <p>"Where's the justice of it?" shouted the tramp. "Where's the right and the
  sense of it? What 'ave <i>I</i> done that I should always get the under side?
  Why should <i>I</i> be stuck on the under side of everything? There's worse
  men than me in all sorts of positions.... Judges there are. 'Orrible
  Kerecters. Ministers and people. I've read abat 'em in the papers....</p>

  <p>"It's we tramps are the scapegoats. Somebody's got to suffer so as the
  police can show a face. Gaw! Some of these days I'll do something.... I'll do
  something. You'll drive me too far with it. I tell you "</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly and listened. Bealby had creaked.</p>

  <p>"Gaw! What can one do?" said the tramp after a long interval.</p>

  <p>And then complaining more gently, the tramp began to feel about to make
  his simple preparations for the night.</p>

  <p>"'Unt me out of this I expect," said the tramp. "And many sleeping in
  feather beds that ain't fit to 'old a candle to me. Not a hordinary farthing
  candle...."</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 5</h3>

  <p class="first">The subsequent hour or so was an interval of tedious
tension for
  Bealby.</p>

  <p>After vast spaces of time he was suddenly aware of three vertical threads
  of light. He stared at them with mysterious awe, until he realized that they
  were just the moonshine streaming through the cracks of the shed.</p>

  <p>The tramp tossed and muttered in his sleep.</p>

  <p>Footsteps?</p>

  <p>Yes&mdash;Footsteps.</p>

  <p>Then voices.</p>

  <p>They were coming along by the edge of the field, and coming and talking
  very discreetly.</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" said the tramp and then softly, "What's that?" Then he too became
  noiselessly attentive.</p>

  <p>Bealby could hear his own heart beating.</p>

  <p>The men were now close outside the shed. "He wouldn't go in there," said
  Mr. Benshaw's voice. "He wouldn't dare. Anyhow we'll go up by the glass
  first. I'll let him have the whole barrel-full of oats if I get a glimpse of
  him. If he'd gone away they'd have caught him in the road...."</p>

  <p>The footsteps receded. There came a cautious rustling on the part of the
  tramp and then his feet padded softly to the door of the shed. He struggled
  to open it, and then with a jerk got it open a few inches; a great bar of
  moonlight leapt and lay still across the floor of the shed. Bealby advanced
  his head cautiously until he could see the black obscure indications of the
  tramp's back as he peeped out.</p>

  <p>"Now," whispered the tramp, and opened the door wider. Then he ducked his
  head down and had darted out of sight, leaving the door open behind him.</p>

  <p>Bealby questioned whether he should follow. He came out a few steps and
  then went back at a shout from away up the garden. "There he goes," shouted a
  voice, "in the shadow of the hedge."</p>

  <p>"Look out, Jim!"&mdash;Bang&mdash;and a yelp.</p>

  <p>"Stand away! I've got another barrel!"</p>

  <p>Bang.</p>

  <p>Then silence for a time, and then the footsteps coming back.</p>

  <p>"That ought to teach him," said Mr. Benshaw. "First time I got him fair,
  and I think I peppered him a bit the second. Couldn't see very well, but I
  heard him yell. He won't forget that in a hurry. Not him. There's nothing
  like oats for fruit-stealers. Jim, just shut that door, will you? That's
  where he was hiding...."</p>

  <p>It seemed a vast time to Bealby before he ventured out into the summer
  moonlight, and a very pitiful and outcast little Bealby he felt himself to
  be.</p>

  <p>He was beginning to realize what it means to go beyond the narrow
  securities of human society. He had no friends, no friends at all....</p>

  <p>He caught at and arrested a sob of self-pity.</p>

  <p>Perhaps after all it was not so late as Bealby had supposed. There were
  still lights in some of the houses and he had the privilege of seeing Mr.
  Benshaw going to bed with pensive deliberation. Mr. Benshaw wore a flannel
  night-shirt and said quite a lengthy prayer before extinguishing his candle.
  Then suddenly Bealby turned nervously and made off through the hedge. A dog
  had barked.</p>

  <p>At first there were nearly a dozen lighted windows in Crayminster. They
  went out one by one. He hung for a long time with a passionate earnestness on
  the sole surviving one, but that too went at last. He could have wept when at
  last it winked out. He came down into the marshy flats by the river, but he
  did not like the way in which the water sucked and swirled in the vague
  moonlight; also he suddenly discovered a great white horse standing quite
  still in the misty grass not thirty yards away; so he went up to and crossed
  the high road and wandered up the hillside towards the allotments, which
  attracted him by reason of the sociability of the numerous tool sheds. In a
  hedge near at hand a young rabbit squealed sharply and was stilled. Why?</p>

  <p>Then something like a short snake scrabbled by very fast through the
  grass.</p>

  <p>Then he thought he saw the tramp stalking him noiselessly behind some
  currant bushes. That went on for some time, but came to nothing.</p>

  <p>Then nothing pursued him, nothing at all. The gap, the void, came after
  him. The bodiless, the faceless, the formless; these are evil hunters in the
  night....</p>

  <p>What a cold still watching thing moonlight can be!....</p>

  <p>He thought he would like to get his back against something solid and found
  near one of the sheds a little heap of litter. He sat down against good
  tarred boards, assured at least that whatever came must come in front.
  Whatever he did, he was resolved, he would not shut his eyes.</p>

  <p>That would be fatal....</p>

  <p>He awoke in broad daylight amidst a cheerful uproar of birds.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 6</h3>

  <p class="first">And then again flight and pursuit were resumed.</p>

  <p>As Bealby went up the hill away from Crayminster he saw a man standing
  over a spade and watching his retreat, and when he looked back again
  presently this man was following. It was Lady Laxton's five pound reward had
  done the thing for him.</p>

  <p>He was half minded to surrender and have done with it, but jail he knew
  was a dreadful thing of stone and darkness. He would make one last effort. So
  he beat along the edge of a plantation and then crossed it and forced his way
  through some gorse and came upon a sunken road, that crossed the hill in a
  gorse-lined cutting. He struggled down the steep bank. At its foot regardless
  of him, unaware of him, a man sat beside a motor bicycle with his fists
  gripped tight and his head downcast, swearing. A county map was crumpled in
  his hand. "Damn!" he cried and flung the map to the ground and kicked it and
  put his foot on it.</p>

  <p>Bealby slipped, came down the bank with a run and found himself in the
  road within a couple of yards of the blonde features and angry eyes of
  Captain Douglas. When he saw the Captain and perceived himself recognized, he
  flopped down&mdash;a done and finished Bealby....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 7</h3>

  <p class="first">He had arrived just in time to interrupt the Captain in a
wild and
  reprehensible fit of passion.</p>

  <p>The Captain imagined it was a secret fit of passion. He thought he was
  quite alone and that no one could hear him or see him. So he had let himself
  shout and stamp, to work off the nervous tensions that tormented him beyond
  endurance.</p>

  <p>In the direct sense of the words the Captain was in love with Madeleine.
  He was in love quite beyond the bounds set by refined and decorous people to
  this dangerous passion. The primordial savage that lurks in so many of us was
  uppermost in him. He was not in love with her prettily or delicately, he was
  in love with her violently and vehemently. He wanted to be with her, he
  wanted to be close to her, he wanted to possess her and nobody else to
  approach her. He was so inflamed now that no other interest in life had any
  importance except as it aided or interfered with this desire. He had forced
  himself in spite of this fever in his blood to leave her in order to pursue
  Bealby, and now he was regretting this firmness furiously. He had expected to
  catch Bealby overnight and bring him back to the hotel in triumph. But Bealby
  had been elusive. There she was, away there, hurt and
  indignant&mdash;neglected!</p>

  <p>"A laggard in love," cried the Captain, "a dastard in war! God!&mdash;I
  run away from everything. First I leave the manoeuvres, then her. Unstable as
  water thou shalt not prevail. Water! What does the confounded boy matter?
  What does he matter?</p>

  <p>"And there she is. Alone! She'll flirt&mdash; naturally she'll flirt.
  Don't I deserve it? Haven't I asked for it? Just the one little time we might
  have had together! I fling it in her face. You fool, you laggard, you
  dastard! And here's this map!"</p>

  <p>A breathing moment.</p>

  <p>"How the devil," cried the Captain, "am I to find the little beast on this
  map?</p>

  <p>"And twice he's been within reach of my hand!</p>

  <p>"No decision!" cried the Captain. "No instant grip! What good is a soldier
  without it? What good is any man who will not leap at opportunity? I ought to
  have chased out last night after that fool and his oats. Then I might have
  had a chance!</p>

  <p>"Chuck it! Chuck the whole thing! Go back to her. Kneel to her, kiss her,
  compel her!</p>

  <p>"And what sort of reception am I likely to get?"</p>

  <p>He crumpled the flapping map in his fist. And then suddenly out of nowhere
  Bealby came rolling down to his feet, a dishevelled and earthy Bealby. But
  Bealby.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" cried the Captain, starting to his feet and holding the map
  like a sword sheath. "What do you want?"</p>

  <p>For a second Bealby was a silent spectacle of misery.</p>

  <p>"Oooh! I want my breckfuss," he burst out at last, reduced to tears.</p>

  <p>"Are you young Bealby?" asked the Captain, seizing him by the
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"They're after me," cried Bealby. "If they catch me they'll put me in
  prison. Where they don't give you anything. It wasn't me did it &mdash;and I
  'aven't had anything to eat&mdash;not since yesterday."</p>

  <p>The Captain came rapidly to a decision. There should be no more faltering.
  He saw his way clear before him. He would act&mdash;like a whistling sword.
  "Here! jump up behind," he said ..." hold on tight to me...."</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 8</h3>

  <p class="first">For a time there was a more than Napoleonic swiftness in
the Captain's
  movements. When Bealby' s pursuer came up to the hedge that looks down into
  the sunken road, there was no Bealby, no Captain, nothing but a torn and
  dishevelled county map, an almost imperceptible odour of petrol and a faint
  sound&mdash; like a distant mowing machine,&mdash;and the motor bicycle was a
  mile away on the road to Beckinstone. Eight miles, eight rather sickening
  miles, Bealby did to Beckinstone in eleven minutes, and there in a little
  coffee-house he was given breakfast with eggs and bacon and marmalade
  (Prime!) and his spirit was restored to him while the Captain raided a
  bicycle and repairing shop and negotiated the hire of an experienced but
  fairly comfortable wicker-work trailer. And so, to London through the morning
  sunshine, leaving tramps, pursuers, policemen, handbills, bakers, market
  gardeners, terrors of the darkness and everything upon the road behind&mdash;
  and farther behind and remote and insignificant&mdash;and so to the vanishing
  point.</p>

  <p>Some few words of explanation the Captain had vouchsafed and that was
  all.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid about it," he said. "Don't be in the least bit afraid.
  You tell them about it, just simply and truthfully, exactly what you did,
  exactly how you got into it and out of it and all about it."</p>

  <p>"You're going to take me up to a Magistrate, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to take you up to the Lord Chancellor himself."</p>

  <p>"And then they won't do anything?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all, Bealby; you trust me.</p>

  <p>All you've got to do is to tell the simple truth...."</p>

  <p>It was pretty rough going in the trailer but very exciting. If you gripped
  the sides very hard and sat quite tight nothing very much happened, and also
  there was a strap across your chest. And you went past everything. There
  wasn't a thing on the road the Captain didn't pass, lowing deeply with his
  great horn when they seemed likely to block his passage. And as for the
  burglary and everything, it would all be settled....</p>

  <p>The Captain also found that ride to London exhilarating. At least he was
  no longer hanging about; he was getting to something. He would be able to go
  back to her&mdash;and all his being now yearned to go back to her&mdash;with
  things achieved, with successes to show. He'd found the boy. He would go
  straight to dear old Uncle Chickney, and Uncle Chickney would put things
  right with Moggeridge, the boy would bear his testimony, Moggeridge would be
  convinced and all would be well again. He might be back with Madeleine that
  evening. He would go back to her, and she would see the wisdom and energy of
  all he had done, and she would lift that dear chin of hers and smile that
  dear smile of hers and hold out her hand to be kissed, and the lights and
  reflections would play on that strong soft neck of hers....</p>

  <p>They buzzed along stretches of common and stretches of straight-edged
  meadowland, by woods and orchards, by pleasant inns and slumbering villages
  and the gates and lodges of country houses.</p>

  <p>These latter grew more numerous and presently they skirted a town, and
  then more road, more villages and at last signs of a nearness to London, more
  frequent houses, more frequent inns, hoardings and advertisements, an
  asphalted side-walk, lamps, a gasworks, laundries, a stretch of suburban
  villadom, a suburban railway station, a suburbanized old town, an omnibus,
  the head of a tramline, a stretch of public common thick with notice-boards,
  a broad pavement, something-or-other parade, with a row of shops....</p>

  <p>London.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8">VIII. &mdash; HOW BEALBY EXPLAINED</a></h2>

  <h3>&sect; 1</h3>

  <p class="first">LORD CHICKNEY was only slightly older than Lord Moggeridge,
but he had not
  worn nearly so well. His hearing was not good, though he would never admit
  it, and the loss of several teeth greatly affected his articulation. One
  might generalize and say that neither physically nor mentally do soldiers
  wear so well as lawyers. The army ages men sooner than the law and
  philosophy; it exposes them more freely to germs, which undermine and
  destroy, and it shelters them more completely from thought, which stimulates
  and preserves. A lawyer must keep his law highly polished and up-to-date or
  he hears of it within a fortnight, a general never realizes he is out of
  training and behind the times until disaster is accomplished. Since the
  magnificent retreat from Bondy-Satina in eighty-seven and his five weeks'
  defence of Barrowgast (with the subsequent operations) the abilities of Lord
  Chickney had never been exercised seriously at all. But there was a certain
  simplicity of manner and a very tall, very drooping, grizzled old-veteran
  picturesqueness about him that kept him distinguished, he was easy to
  recognize on public occasions on account of his vast height and his vast
  blonde-white moustaches, and so he got pointed out when greater men were
  ignored. The autograph collectors adored him. Every morning he would spend
  half an hour writing autographs and patriotic sentiments, and the habit was
  so strong in him that on Sundays, when there was no London post, and
  autograph writing would have been wrong anyhow, he filled the time in copying
  out the epistle and gospel for the day. And he liked to be well in the
  foreground of public affairs&mdash;if possible wearing his decorations. After
  the autographs he would work, sometimes for hours, for various patriotic and
  morally aggressive societies, and more particularly for those which opposed
  Socialism in every shape and form and those which sought to deprive working
  people, and particularly working girls, of the temptations that arise from
  unassigned leisure. He had a peculiar vague horror of SociaLism which he
  regarded as a compound of atheism, republicanism, blight, mildew, measles,
  and all the worst characteristics of a Continental sabbath.</p>

  <p>He wrote and toiled for these societies, but he could not speak for them
  on account of his teeth. For he had one peculiar weakness; he had faced death
  in many forms but he had never faced a dentist. The thought of dentists gave
  him just the same sick horror as the thought of Socialism. But it was a great
  grief to him that he could not speak his mind.</p>

  <p>He was a man of blameless private life, a widower and childless. In later
  years he had come to believe that he had once been very deeply in love with
  his cousin Susan, who had married a rather careless husband named Douglas;
  both she and Douglas were dead now, but he maintained a touching affection
  for her two lively rather than satisfying sons. He called them his nephews,
  and by the continuous attrition of affection he had become their recognized
  uncle. He was glad when they came to him in their scrapes, and he liked to be
  seen about with them in public places. They regarded him with considerable
  confidence and respect and an affection that they sometimes blamed themselves
  for as not quite warm enough for his merits. But there is a kind of injustice
  about affection.</p>

  <p>He was really gratified when he got a wire from the less discreditable of
  these two bright young relations, saying, "Sorely in need of your advice.
  Hope to bring difficulties to you to-day at twelve."</p>

  <p>He concluded very naturally that the boy had come to some crisis in his
  unfortunate entanglement with Madeleine Philips, and he was flattered by the
  trustfulness that brought the matter to him. He resolved to be delicate but
  wily, honourable, strictly honourable, but steadily, patiently separative. He
  paced his spacious study with his usual morning's work neglected, and
  rehearsed little sentences in his mind that might be effective in the
  approaching interview. There would probably be emotion. He would pat the lad
  on his shoulder and be himself a little emotional. "I understand, my boy," he
  would say, "I understand.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget, my boy, that I've been a young man too."</p>

  <p>He would be emotional, he would be sympathetic, but also he must be a man
  of the world. "Sort of thing that won't do, you know, my boy; sort of thing
  that people will not stand.... A soldier's wife has to be a soldier's wife
  and nothing else.... Your business is to serve the King, not&mdash;not some
  celebrity. Lovely no doubt, I don't deny the charm of her&mdash;but on the
  hoardings, my boy.... Now don't you think&mdash;don't you
  <i>think</i>?&mdash;there's some nice pure girl somewhere, sweet as violets,
  new as the dawn, and ready to be <i>yours</i>; a girl I mean, a maiden fancy
  free, not&mdash;how shall I put it?&mdash; a woman of the world. Wonderful I
  admit&mdash;but seasoned. Public. My dear, dear boy, I knew your mother when
  she was a girl, a sweet pure girl&mdash;a thing of dewy freshness. Ah! Well I
  remember her! All these years, my boy&mdash; Nothing. It's difficult....</p>

  <p>Tears stood in his brave old blue eyes as he elaborated such phrases. He
  went up and down mumbling them through the defective teeth and the long
  moustache and waving an eloquent hand.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 2</h3>

  <p class="first">When Lord Chickney's thoughts had once started in any
direction it was
  difficult to turn them aside. No doubt that concealed and repudiated deafness
  helped his natural perplexity of mind. Truth comes to some of us as a still
  small voice, but Lord Chickney needed shouting and prods. And Douglas did not
  get to him until he was finishing lunch. Moreover it was the weakness of
  Captain Douglas to talk in jerky fragments and undertones, rather than
  clearly and fully in the American fashion. "Tell me all about it, my boy,"
  said Lord Chickney. "Tell me all about it. Don't apologize for your clothes.
  I understand. Motor bicycle and just come up. But have you had any lunch,
  Eric?"</p>

  <p>"Alan, uncle,&mdash;not Eric. My brother is Eric."</p>

  <p>"Well, I called him Alan. Tell me all about it. Tell me what has happened.
  What are you thinking of doing? Just put the position before me. To tell you
  the truth I've been worrying over this business for some time."</p>

  <p>"Didn't know you'd heard of it, uncle. He can't have talked about it
  already. Anyhow,&mdash; you see all the awkwardness of the situation. They
  say the old chap's a thundering spiteful old devil when he's roused&mdash;and
  there's no doubt he was roused.... Tremendously...."</p>

  <p>Lord Chickney was not listening very attentively. Indeed he was also
  talking. "Not clear to me there was another man in it," he was saying. "That
  makes it more complicated, my boy, makes the row acuter. Old fellow, eh?
  Who?"</p>

  <p>They came to a pause at the same moment.</p>

  <p>"You speak so indistinctly," complained Lord Chickney. "Who did you
  say?"</p>

  <p>"I thought you understood. Lord Moggeridge."</p>

  <p>"Lord! Lord Moggeridge! My dear Boy!</p>

  <p>But how?"</p>

  <p>"I thought you understood, uncle."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't want to marry her! Tut! Never! Why the man must be sixty if
  he's a day...."</p>

  <p>Captain Douglas regarded his distinguished uncle for a moment with
  distressed eyes. Then he came nearer, raised his voice and spoke more
  deliberately.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether you quite understand, uncle. I am talking about this
  affair at Shonts last week-end."</p>

  <p>"My dear Boy, there's no need for you to shout. If only you don't mumble
  and clip your words&mdash;and turn head over heels with your ideas. Just tell
  me about it plainly. Who is Shonts? One of those Liberal peers? I seem to
  have heard the name...."</p>

  <p>"Shonts, uncle, is the house the Laxtons have; you know,&mdash;Lucy."</p>

  <p>"Little Lucy! I remember her. Curls all down her back. Married the
  milkman. But how does she come in, Alan? The story's getting complicated. But
  that's the worst of these infernal affairs,&mdash;they always do get
  complicated. Tangled skeins&mdash;</p>

  <p>Oh what a tangled web we weave, When first we venture to deceive.</p>

  <p>And now, like a sensible man, you want to get out of it."</p>

  <p>Captain Douglas was bright pink with the effort to control himself and
  keep perfectly plain and straightforward. His hair had become like tow and
  little beads of perspiration stood upon his forehead.</p>

  <p>I spent last week-end at Shonts," he said.</p>

  <p>Lord Moggeridge, also there, week-ending. Got it into his head that I was
  pulling his leg."</p>

  <p>"Naturally, my boy, if he goes philandering. At his time of life. What
  else can he expect?"</p>

  <p>"It wasn't philandering."</p>

  <p>"Fine distinctions. Fine distinctions. Go on &mdash;anyhow."</p>

  <p>"He got it into his head that I was playing practical jokes upon him.
  Confused me with Eric. It led to a rather first-class row. I had to get out
  of the house. Nothing else to do. He brought all sorts of accusations "</p>

  <p>Captain Douglas stopped short. His uncle was no longer attending to him.
  They had drifted to the window of the study and the General was staring with
  an excitement and intelligence that grew visibly at the spectacle of Bealby
  and the trailer outside. For Bealby had been left in the trailer and he was
  sitting as good as gold waiting for the next step in his vindication from the
  dark charge of burglary. He was very travel-worn and the trailer was
  time-worn as well as travel-worn, and both contrasted with the efficient
  neatness and newness of the motor bicycle in front. The contrast had
  attracted the attention of a tall policeman who was standing in a state of
  elucidatory meditation regarding Bealby. Bealby was not regarding the
  policeman. He had the utmost confidence in Captain Douglas, he felt sure that
  he would presently be purged of all the horror of that dead old man and of
  the brief unpremeditated plunge into crime, but still for the present at any
  rate he did not feel equal to staring a policeman out of countenance....</p>

  <p>From the window the policeman very largely obscured Bealby....</p>

  <p>Whenever hearts are simple there lurks romance. Age cannot wither nor
  custom stale her infinite diversity. Suddenly out of your kindly diplomacies,
  your sane man-of-the-world intentions, leaps the imagination like a rocket,
  flying from such safe securities bang into the sky. So it happened to the old
  General. He became deaf to everything but the appearances before him. The
  world was jewelled with dazzling and delightful possibilities. His face was
  lit by a glow of genuine romantic excitement. He grasped his nephew's arm. He
  pointed. His grizzled cheeks flushed.</p>

  <p>"That isn't," he asked with something verging upon admiration in his voice
  and manner, "a Certain Lady in disguise?"</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 3</h3>

  <p class="first">It became clear to Captain Douglas that if ever he was to
get to Lord
  Moggeridge that day he must take his uncle firmly in hand. Without even
  attempting not to appear to shout he cried, "That is a little Boy. That is my
  Witness. It is Most Important that I should get him to Lord Moggeridge to
  tell his Story."</p>

  <p>"What story?" cried the old commander pulling at his moustache and still
  eyeing Bealby suspiciously....</p>

  <p>It took exactly half an hour to get Lord Chickney from that inquiry to the
  telephone and even then he was still far from clear about the matter in hand.
  Captain Douglas got in most of the facts, but he could not eliminate an idea
  that it all had to do with Madeleine. Whenever he tried to say clearly that
  she was entirely outside the question, the General patted his shoulder and
  looked very wise and kind and said, "My dear Boy, I quite understand; I quite
  understand. Never mention a lady. No."</p>

  <p>So they started at last rather foggily&mdash;so far as things of the mind
  went, though the sun that day was brilliant&mdash;and because of engine
  trouble in Port Street the General's hansom reached Little Tenby Street first
  and he got in a good five minutes preparing the Lord Chancellor tactfully and
  carefully before the bicycle and its trailer came upon the scene....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 4</h3>

  <p class="first">Candler had been packing that morning with unusual
solicitude for a week-
  end at Tulliver Abbey. His master had returned from the catastrophe of
  Shonts, fatigued, visibly aged and extraordinarily cross, and Candler looked
  to Tulliver Abbey to restore him to his former self. Nothing must be
  forgotten; there must be no little hitches, everything from first to last
  must go on oiled wheels, or it was clear his lordship might develop a
  desperate hostility to these excursions, excursions which Candler found
  singularly refreshing and entertaining during the stresses of the session.
  Tulliver Abbey was as good a house as Shonts was bad; Lady Checksammington
  ruled with the softness of velvet and the strength of steel over a household
  of admirably efficient domestics, and there would be the best of people
  there, Mr. Evesham perhaps, the Loopers, Lady Privet, Andreas Doria and Mr.
  Pernambuco, great silken mellow personages and diamond-like individualities,
  amidst whom Lord Moggeridge's mind would be restfully active and his comfort
  quite secure. And as far as possible Candler wanted to get the books and
  papers his master needed into the trunk or the small valise. That habit of
  catching up everything at the last moment and putting it under his arm and
  the consequent need for alert picking up, meant friction and nervous wear and
  tear for both master and man.</p>

  <p>Lord Moggeridge rose at half-past ten&mdash;he had been kept late
  overnight by a heated discussion at the Aristotelian&mdash;and breakfasted
  lightly upon a chop and coffee. Then something ruffled him; something that
  came with the letters. Candler could not quite make out what it was but he
  suspected another pamphlet by Dr. Schiller. It could not be the chop because
  Lord Moggeridge was always wonderfully successful with chops. Candler looked
  through the envelopes and letters afterwards and found nothing diagnostic,
  and then he observed a copy of Mind torn across and lying in the waste-paper
  basket.</p>

  <p>"When I went out of the room," said Candler discreetly examining this.
  "Very likely it's that there Schiller after all."</p>

  <p>But in this Candler was mistaken. What had disturbed the Lord Chancellor
  was a coarsely disrespectful article on the Absolute by a Cambridge Rhodes
  scholar written in that flighty facetious strain that spreads now like a
  pestilence over modern philosophical discussion. "Does the Absolute, on Lord
  Moggeridge's own showing, mean anything more than an eloquent oiliness
  uniformly distributed through space?" and so on.</p>

  <p>Pretty bad!</p>

  <p>Lord Moggeridge early in life had deliberately acquired a quite
  exceptional power of mental self-control. He took his perturbed mind now and
  threw it forcibly into the consideration of a case upon which he had reserved
  judgment. He was to catch the 3.35 at Paddington, and at two he was smoking a
  cigar after a temperate lunch and reading over the notes of this judgment. It
  was then that the telephone bell became audible, and Candler came in to
  inform him that Lord Chickney was anxious to see him at once upon a matter of
  some slight importance.</p>

  <p>"Slight importance?" asked Lord Moggeridge.</p>

  <p>"Some slight importance, my lord."</p>

  <p>"Some? Slight?"</p>

  <p>"'Is lordship, my lord, mumbles rather now 'is back teeth 'ave gone," said
  Candler, "but so I understand 'im."</p>

  <p>"These apologetic assertive phrases annoy me, Candler," said Lord
  Moggeridge over his shoulder. "You see," he turned round and spoke very
  clearly, "either the matter is of importance or it is not of importance. A
  thing must either be or not be. I wish you would manage&mdash;when you get
  messages on the telephone... But I suppose that is asking too much.... Will
  you explain to him, Candler, when we start, and&mdash;ask him,
  Candler&mdash;ask him what sort of matter it is."</p>

  <p>Candler returned after some parleying.</p>

  <p>"So far as I can make 'is lordship out, my lord, 'e says 'e wants to set
  you right about something, my lord. He says something about a little
  misapprehension."</p>

  <p>"These diminutives, Candler, kill sense. Does he say what sort&mdash;what
  sort&mdash;of little misapprehension?"</p>

  <p>"He says something&mdash;I'm sorry, my lord, but it's about Shonts, my
  lord."</p>

  <p>"Then I don't want to hear about it," said Lord Moggeridge.</p>

  <p>There was a pause. The Lord Chancellor resumed his reading with a
  deliberate obviousness; the butler hovered.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, my lord, but I can't think exactly what I ought to say to 'is
  lordship, my lord."</p>

  <p>"Tell him&mdash;tell him that I do not wish to hear anything more about
  Shonts for ever. Simply."</p>

  <p>Candler hesitated and went out, shutting the door carefully lest any
  fragment of his halting rendering of this message to Lord Chickney should
  reach his master's ears.</p>

  <p>Lord Moggeridge's powers of mental control</p>

  <p>were, I say, very great He could dismiss</p>

  <p>subjects from his mind absolutely. In a few instants he had completely
  forgotten Shonts and was making notes with a silver-cased pencil on the
  margins of his draft judgment.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 5</h3>

  <p class="first">He became aware that Candler had returned.</p>

  <p>"'Is lordship, Lord Chickney, my lord, is very persistent, my lord. 'E's
  rung up twice. 'E says now that 'e makes a personal matter of it. Come what
  may, 'e says, 'e wishes to speak for two minutes to your lordship. Over the
  telephone, my lord, 'e vouchsafes no further information."</p>

  <p>Lord Moggeridge meditated over the end of his third after-lunch cigar. His
  man watched the end of his left eyebrow as an engineer might watch a steam
  gauge. There were no signs of an explosion. "He must come, Candler," his
  lordship said at last....</p>

  <p>"Oh, Candler!"</p>

  <p>"My lord?"</p>

  <p>"Put the bags and things in a conspicuous position in the hall, Candler.
  Change yourself, and see that you look thoroughly like trains. And in fact
  have everything ready, prominently ready, Candler."</p>

  <p>Then once more Lord Moggeridge concentrated his mind.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 6</h3>

  <p class="first">To him there presently entered Lord Chickney.</p>

  <p>Lord Chickney had been twice round the world and he had seen many strange
  and dusky peoples and many remarkable customs and peculiar prejudices, which
  he had never failed to despise, but he had never completely shaken off the
  county family ideas in which he had been brought up. He believed that there
  was an incurable difference in spirit between quite good people like himself
  and men from down below like Moggeridge, who was the son of an Exeter
  chorister. He believed that these men from nowhere always cherished the
  profoundest respect for the real thing like himself, that they were greedy
  for association and gratified by notice, and so for the life of him he could
  not approach Lord Moggeridge without a faint sense of condescension. He
  saluted him as "my dear Lord Moggeridge," wrung his hand with effusion, and
  asked him kind, almost district-visiting questions about his younger brother
  and the aspect of his house. "And you are just off, I see, for a
  weekend."</p>

  <p>These amenities the Lord Chancellor acknowledged by faint gruntings and an
  almost imperceptible movement of his eyebrows. "There was a matter," he said,
  "some little matter, on which you want to consult me?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Lord Chickney and rubbed his chin. "Yes. Yes, there was a
  little matter, a little trouble "</p>

  <p>"Of an urgent nature."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Yes. Exactly. Just a little complicated, you know, not quite
  simple." The dear old soldier's manner became almost seductive. "One of these
  difficult little affairs, where one has to remember that one is a man of the
  world, you know. A little complication about a lady, known to you both. But
  one must make concessions, one must understand. The boy has a witness. Things
  are not as you supposed them to be."</p>

  <p>Lord Moggeridge had a clean conscience about ladies; he drew out his watch
  and looked at it&mdash;aggressively. He kept it in his hand during his
  subsequent remarks.</p>

  <p>"I must confess," he declared, "I have not the remotest idea.... If you
  will be so good as to be&mdash;elementary. What is it all about?"</p>

  <p>"You see I knew the lad's mother," said</p>

  <p>Lord Chickney. "In fact " He became</p>

  <p>insanely confidential&mdash;" Under happier circumstances&mdash;don't
  misunderstand me, Moggeridge; I mean no evil&mdash;but he might have been my
  son. I feel for him like a son...."</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 7</h3>

  <p class="first">When presently Captain Douglas, a little heated from his
engine trouble,
  came into the room&mdash;he had left Bealby with Candler in the hall&mdash;it
  was instantly manifest to him that the work of preparation had been
  inadequately performed.</p>

  <p>"One minute more, my dear Alan," cried Lord Chickney.</p>

  <p>Lord Moggeridge with eyebrows waving and watch in hand was of a different
  opinion. He addressed himself to Captain Douglas.</p>

  <p>"There isn't a minute more," he said. "What is all this&mdash;this
  philoprogenitive rigmarole about? Why have you come to me? My cab is outside
  now. All this about ladies and witnesses;&mdash;what is it?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly simple, my lord! You imagine that I played practical jokes upon
  you at Shonts. I didn't. I have a witness. The attack upon you downstairs,
  the noise in your room "</p>

  <p>"Have I any guarantee?"</p>

  <p>"It's the steward's boy from Shonts. Your man outside knows him. Saw him
  in the steward's room. He made the trouble for you &mdash;and me, and then he
  ran away. Just caught him. Not exchanged thirty words with him. Half a dozen
  questions. Settle everything.</p>

  <p>Then you'll know&mdash;nothing for you but the utmost respect."</p>

  <p>Lord Moggeridge pressed his lips together and resisted conviction.</p>

  <p>"In consideration," interpolated Lord Chickney, "feelings of an old
  fellow. Old soldier. Boy means no harm."</p>

  <p>With the rudeness of one sorely tried the Lord Chancellor thrust the
  General aside. "Oh I " he said, "Oh!" and then to Captain Douglas. "One
  minute. Where's your witness?..."</p>

  <p>The Captain opened a door. Bealby found himself bundled into the presence
  of two celebrated men.</p>

  <p>"Tell him," said Captain Douglas. "And look sharp about it."</p>

  <p>"Tell me plainly," cried the Lord Chancellor. "And be&mdash;quick."</p>

  <p>He put such a point on " quick " that it made Bealby jump.</p>

  <p>"Tell him," said the General more gently. "Don't be afraid."</p>

  <p>"Well," began Bealby after one accumulating pause, "it was 'im told me to
  do it. 'E said you go in there "</p>

  <p>The Captain would have interrupted but the Lord Chancellor restrained him
  by a magnificent gesture of the hand holding the watch.</p>

  <p>"He told you to do it!" he said. "I knew he did. Now listen! He told you
  practically to go in and do anything you could."</p>

  <p>"Yessir." Woe took possession of Bealby. "I didn't do any 'arm to the ole
  gentleman."</p>

  <p>"But who told you?" cried the Captain. "Who told you?"</p>

  <p>Lord Moggeridge annihilated him with arm and eyebrows. He held Bealby
  fascinated by a pointing finger.</p>

  <p>"Don't do more than answer the questions. I have thirty seconds more. He
  told you to go in. He made you go in. At the earliest possible opportunity
  you got away?"</p>

  <p>"I jest nipped out "</p>

  <p>"Enough! And now, sir, how dare you come here without even a plausible
  lie? How dare you after your intolerable tomfoolery at Shonts confront me
  again with fresh tomfoolery? How dare you drag in your gallant and venerable
  uncle in this last preposterous&mdash; I suppose you would call
  it&mdash;lark! I suppose you had prepared that little wretch with some fine
  story. Little you know of False Witness! At the first question, he breaks
  down! He does not even begin his lie. He at least knows the difference
  between my standards and yours. Candler! Candler!"</p>

  <p>Candler appeared.</p>

  <p>"These&mdash;these gentlemen are going. Is everything ready?"</p>

  <p>"The cab is at the door, m'lord. The usual cab."</p>

  <p>Captain Douglas made one last desperate effort. "Sir!" he said. "My lord
  "</p>

  <p>The Lord Chancellor turned upon him with a face that he sought to keep
  calm, though the eyebrows waved and streamed like black smoke in a gale.
  "Captain Douglas," he said, "you are probably not aware of the demands upon
  the time and patience of a public servant in such a position as mine. You see
  the world no doubt as a vastly entertaining fabric upon which you can
  embroider your&mdash;your facetious arrangements. Well, it is not so. It is
  real. It is earnest. You may sneer at the simplicity of an old man, but what
  I tell you of life is true. Comic effect is not, believe me, its goal. And
  you, sir, you, sir, you impress me as an intolerably foolish, flippant and
  unnecessary young man. Flippant. Unnecessary. Foolish."</p>

  <p>As he said these words Candler approached him with a dust coat of a
  peculiar fineness and dignity, and he uttered the last words over his
  protruded chest while Candler assisted his arms into his sleeves.</p>

  <p>"My lord," said Captain Douglas again, but his resolution was deserting
  him.</p>

  <p>"No," said the Lord Chancellor, leaning forward in a minatory manner while
  Candler pulled down the tail of his jacket and adjusted the collar of his
  overcoat.</p>

  <p>"Uncle," said Captain Douglas.</p>

  <p>"No," said the General, with the curt decision of a soldier and turned
  exactly ninety degrees away from him. "You little know how you have hurt me,
  Alan! You little know. I couldn't have imagined it. The Douglas strain! False
  Witness&mdash;and insult. I am sorry, my dear Moggeridge, beyond
  measure."</p>

  <p>"I quite understand&mdash;you are as much a victim as myself. Quite. A
  more foolish attempt I am sorry to be in this hurry "</p>

  <p>"Oh! You damned little fool," said the Captain and advanced a step towards
  the perplexed and shrinking Bealby. "You imbecile little trickster! What do
  you mean by it?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean anything!"</p>

  <p>Then suddenly the thought of Madeleine, sweet and overpowering, came into
  the head of this distraught young man. He had risked losing her, he had
  slighted and insulted her and here he was&mdash;entangled. Here he was in a
  position of nearly inconceivable foolishness, about to assault a dirty and
  silly little boy in the presence of the Lord Chancellor and Uncle Chickney.
  The world, he felt, was lost, and not well lost. And she was lost too. Even
  now while he pursued these follies she might be consoling her wounded
  pride....</p>

  <p>He perceived that love is the supreme thing in life. He perceived that he
  who divides his purposes scatters his life to the four winds of heaven. A
  vehement resolve to cut the whole of this Bealby business pounced upon him.
  In that moment he ceased to care for reputation, for appearances, for the
  resentment of Lord Moggeridge or the good intentions of Uncle Chickney.</p>

  <p>He turned, he rushed out of the room. He escaped by unparalleled
  gymnastics the worst consequence? of an encounter with the Lord Chancellor's
  bag which the under-butler had placed rather tactlessly between the doors,
  crossed the wide and dignified hall, and in another moment had his engine
  going and was struggling to mount his machine in the street without. His face
  expressed an almost apoplectic concentration. He narrowly missed the noses of
  a pair of horses in the carriage of Lady Beach Mandarin, made an
  extraordinary curve to spare a fishmonger's tricycle, shaved the front and
  completely destroyed the gesture of that eminent actor manager, Mr.
  Pomegranate, who was crossing the road in his usual inadvertent fashion, and
  then he was popping and throbbing and banging round the corner and on his way
  back to the lovely and irresistible woman who was exerting so disastrous an
  influence upon his career</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 8</h3>

  <p class="first">The Captain fled from London in the utmost fury and to the
general danger
  of the public. His heart was full of wicked blasphemies, shoutings and self-
  reproaches, but outwardly he seemed only pinkly intent. And as he crossed an
  open breezy common and passed by a milestone bearing this inscription, "To
  London Thirteen Miles," his hind tyre burst conclusively with a massive
  report....</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 9</h3>

  <p class="first">In every life there are crucial moments, turning points,
and not
  infrequently it is just such a thing as this, a report, a sudden waking in
  the night, a flash upon the road to Damascus that marks and precipitates the
  accumulating new. Vehemence is not concentration. The headlong violence of
  the Captain had been no expression of a single-minded purpose, of a soul all
  gathered together to an end. Far less a pursuit had it been than a flight, a
  flight from his own dissensions. And now&mdash;now he was held.</p>

  <p>After he had attempted a few plausible repairs and found the tyre
  obdurate, after he had addressed ill-chosen remonstrances to some unnamed
  hearer, after he had walked some way along the road and back in an indecision
  about repair shops in some neighbouring town, the last dregs of his
  resistance were spent. He perceived that he was in the presence of a Lesson.
  He sat down by the roadside some twenty feet from the disabled motor bicycle,
  and, impotent for further effort, frankly admitted himself overtaken. He had
  not reckoned with punctures.</p>

  <p>The pursuing questions came clambering upon him and would no longer be
  denied: who he was and what he was and how he was, and the meaning of this
  Rare Bate he had been in, and all those deep questions that are so
  systematically neglected in the haste and excitement of modern life.</p>

  <p>In short, for the first time in many headlong days he asked himself simply
  and plainly what he thought he was up to?</p>

  <p>Certain things became clear, and so minutely and exactly clear that it was
  incredible that they had ever for a moment been obscure. Of course Bealby had
  been a perfectly honest little boy, under some sort of misconception, and of
  course he ought to have been carefully coached and prepared and rehearsed
  before he was put before the Lord Chancellor. This was so manifest now that
  the Captain stared aghast at his own inconceivable negligence. But the
  mischief was done. Nothing now would ever propitiate Moggeridge, nothing now
  would ever reconcile Uncle Chickney. That was&mdash;settled. But what was not
  settled was the amazing disorder of his own mind. Why had he been so
  negligent, what had come over his mind in the last few weeks?</p>

  <p>And this sudden strange illumination of the Captain's mind went so far as
  perceiving that the really important concern for him was not the accidents of
  Shonts but this epilepsy of his own will. Why now was he rushing back to
  Madeleine? Why? He did not love her. He knew he did not love her. On the
  whole, more than anything else he resented her.</p>

  <p>But he was excited about her, he was so excited that these other muddles,
  fluctuations, follies, came as a natural consequence from that. Out of this
  excitement came those wild floods of angry energy that made him career
  about&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Like some damned Cracker," said the Captain.</p>

  <p>"For instance," he asked himself, "<i>now</i>! what am I going for?"</p>

  <p>"If I go back she'll probably behave like an offended Queen. Doesn't seem
  to understand anything that does not focus on herself. Wants a sort of
  Limelight Lover....</p>

  <p>She relies upon exciting me!</p>

  <p>She relies upon exciting everyone!&mdash;she's just a woman specialized
  for excitement."</p>

  <p>And after meditating through a profound minute upon this judgment, the
  Captain pronounced these two epoch-making words: <i>"I won't!"</i></p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 10</h3>

  <p class="first">The Captain's mind was now in a state of almost violent
lucidity.</p>

  <p>"This sex stuff," he said, "first I kept it under too tight and now I've
  let it rip too loose.</p>

  <p>"I've been just a distracted fool, with my head swimming with meetings and
  embraces and&mdash;frills."</p>

  <p>He produced some long impending generalizations.</p>

  <p>"Not a man's work, this Lover business. Dancing about in a world of
  petticoats and powder puffs and attentions and jealousies. Rotten game....
  Played off against some other man....</p>

  <p>"I'll be hanged if I am.... Have to put women in their places.... Make a
  hash of everything if we don't...."</p>

  <p>Then for a time the Captain meditated in silence and chewed his knuckle.
  His face darkened to a scowl. He swore as though some thought twisted and
  tormented him. "Let some other man get her! Think of her with some other
  man.</p>

  <p>"I don't care," he said, when obviously he did. "There's other women in
  the world.</p>

  <p>"A man&mdash;a man mustn't care for that....</p>

  <p>"It's this or that," said the Captain, "anyhow...."</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 11</h3>

  <p class="first">Suddenly the Captain's mind was made up and done.</p>

  <p>He arose to his feet and his face was firm and tranquil and now nearer
  pallor than pink. He left his bicycle and trailer by the wayside even as
  Christian left his burden. He asked a passing nurse-girl the way to the
  nearest railway station and thither he went. Incidentally and because the
  opportunity offered he called in upon a cyclist's repair shop and committed
  his abandoned machinery to its keeping. He went straight to London, changed
  at his flat, dined at his club and caught the night train for
  France&mdash;for France and whatever was left of the grand manoeuvres.</p>

  <p>He wrote a letter to Madeleine from the Est train next day, using their
  customary endearments, avoiding any discussion of their relations and
  describing the scenery of the Seine valley and the characteristics of Rouen
  in a few vivid and masterly phrases.</p>

  <p>"If she's worth having she'll understand," said the Captain, but he knew
  perfectly well she would not understand.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Geedge noted this letter among the others, and afterwards she was
  much exercised by Madeleine's behaviour. For suddenly that lady became
  extraordinarily gay and joyous in her bearing, singing snatches of song and
  bubbling over with suggestions for larks and picnics and wild excursions. She
  patted Mr. Geedge on the shoulder and ran her arm through the arm of
  Professor Bowles. Both gentlemen received these familiarities with a gawky
  coyness that Mrs. Geedge found contemptible. And moreover Madeleine drew
  several shy strangers into their circle. She invited the management to a
  happy participation.</p>

  <p>Her great idea was a moonlight picnic. "We'll have a great camp-fire and
  afterwards we'll dance&mdash;this very night."</p>

  <p>"But wouldn't it be better to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"To-night!"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow perhaps Captain Douglas may be back again. And he's so good at
  all these things."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Geedge knew better because she had seen the French stamp on the
  letter, but she meant to get to the bottom of this business, and thus it was
  she said this.</p>

  <p>"I've sent him back to his soldiering," said Madeleine serenely. "He has
  better things to do."</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 12</h3>

  <p class="first">For some moments after the unceremonious departure of
Captain Douglas from
  the presence of Lord Moggeridge, it did not occur to anyone, it did not occur
  even to Bealby, that the Captain had left his witness behind him. The General
  and the Lord Chancellor moved into the hall, and Bealby, under the sway of a
  swift compelling gesture from Candler, followed modestly. The same current
  swept them all out into the portico, and while the under-butler whistled up a
  hansom for the General, the Lord Chancellor with a dignity that was at once
  polite and rapid, and with Candler gravely protective and a little reproving,
  departed. Bealby, slowly apprehending their desertion, regarded the world of
  London with perplexity and dismay. Candler had gone. The last of the
  gentlemen was going. The under-butler, Bealby felt, was no friend.
  Under-butlers never are.</p>

  <p>Lord Chickney in the very act of entering his cab had his coat-tail
  tugged. He looked inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Please, sir, there's me," said Bealby.</p>

  <p>Lord Chickney reflected. "Well?" he said.</p>

  <p>The spirit of Bealby was now greatly abased. His face and voice betrayed
  him on the verge of tears. "I want to go 'ome to Shonts, sir."</p>

  <p>Well, my boy, go 'ome&mdash;go home I mean to Shonts."</p>

  <p>"'E's gone, sir," said Bealby....</p>

  <p>Lord Chickney was a good-hearted man, and he knew that a certain public
  kindliness and disregard of appearances, looks far better and is infinitely
  more popular than a punctilious dignity. He took Bealby to Waterloo in his
  hansom, got him a third-class ticket to Chelsome, tipped a porter to see him
  safely into his train and dismissed him in the most fatherly manner.</p><br>

  <h3>&sect; 13</h3>

  <p class="first">It was well after tea-time, Bealby felt, as he came once
more within the
  boundaries of the Shonts estate.</p>

  <p>It was a wiser and a graver Bealby who returned from this week of
  miscellaneous adventure. He did not clearly understand all that had happened
  to him; in particular he was puzzled by the extreme annoyance and sudden
  departure of Captain Douglas from the presence of Lord Moggeridge; but his
  general impression s was that he had been in great peril of dire ( punishment
  and that he had been rather hastily and ignominiously reprieved. The nice old
  gentleman with the long grey moustaches had dismissed him to the train at
  last with a quality of benediction. But Bealby understood now better than he
  had done before that adventures do not always turn out well for the boy hero,
  and that the social system has a number of dangerous and disagreeable holes
  at the bottom. He had reached the beginnings of wisdom. He was glad he had
  got away from the tramp and still gladder that he had got away from
  Crayminster; he was sorry that he would never see the beautiful lady again,
  and perplexed and perplexed. And also he was interested in the probability of
  his mother having toast for tea....</p>

  <p>It must, he felt, be a long time after tea-time, &mdash;quite late....</p>

  <p>He had weighed the advisability of returning quietly to his windowless
  bedroom under the stairs, putting on his little green apron and emerging with
  a dutiful sang-froid as if nothing had happened, on the one hand, or of going
  to the gardens on the other. But tea&mdash;with eatables&mdash;seemed more
  probable at the gardens....</p>

  <p>He was deflected from the direct route across the park by a long deep
  trench, that someone had made and abandoned since the previous Sunday
  morning. He wondered what it was for. It was certainly very ugly. And as he
  came out by the trees and got the full effect of the facade, he detected a
  strangely bandaged quality about Shonts. It was as if Shonts had recently
  been in a fight and got a black eye. Then he saw the reason for this; one
  tower was swathed in scaffolding. He wondered what could have happened to the

  <p>He was so fortunate as not to meet his father in the gardens, and he
  entered the house so meekly that his mother did not look up from the cashmere
  she was sewing. She was sitting at the table sewing some newly dyed black
  cashmere.</p>

  <p>He was astonished at her extreme pallor and the drooping resignation of
  her pose.</p>

  bright round astonished eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, mother, I 'aven't been quite a good steward's-room boy,
  mother. If I could 'ave another go, mother...."</p>

  with that strange expression and opened and shut her mouth.</p>
